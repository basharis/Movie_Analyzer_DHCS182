        "This is the story of a nine-year-old boy named Hogarth Hughes who makes friends with an innocent alien giant robot that came from outer space. Meanwhile, a paranoid U.S. Government agent named Kent Mansley arrives in town, determined to destroy the giant at all costs.

        "Set in the 1950's, Hogarth, a young boy from Maine, befriends a massive robot that crashed onto Earth, the Iron Giant. While developing a friendship with it, Kent Mansley, a government agent, will stop at nothing to destroy it, and will not change his mind. Because of the boy's attachment with the robot, he'll try to stall Kent's progress, such as using a different chocolate for Kent's sundae. He's also kept the robot at Dean's scrapyard, despite his reluctance to keep him there. But their mutual hatred of Kent's cruel intentions might just keep the friendship between them.::gamergcfan",
        "An enormous robot has come from deepest space, crash-landed on Earth, and followed eleven-year-old Hogarth Hughes home. Now, young Hogarth has one big friend and an even bigger problem: How do you keep a secret that's 50 feet tall? Especially when a paranoid government agent is on the \"alien invader's\" trail, bringing with him the full might of the U.S. military to destroy the giant.::Nostalgia Boy",
