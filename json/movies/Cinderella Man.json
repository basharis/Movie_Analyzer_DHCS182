        "During the Great Depression, a common-man hero, James J. Braddock--a.k.a. the Cinderella Man--was to become one of the most surprising sports legends in history. By the early 1930s, the impoverished ex-prizefighter was seemingly as broken-down, beaten-up and out-of-luck as much of the rest of the American populace who had hit rock bottom. His career appeared to be finished, he was unable to pay the bills, the only thing that mattered to him--his family--was in danger, and he was even forced to go on Public Relief. But deep inside, Jim Braddock never relinquished his determination. Driven by love, honor and an incredible dose the ones who are do of grit, he willed an impossible dream to come true. In a last-chance bid to help his family, Braddock returned to the ring. No one thought he had a shot. However Braddock, fueled by something beyond mere competition, kept winning. Suddenly, the ordinary working man became the mythic athlete. Carrying the hopes and dreams of the disenfranchised on his shoulders, Braddock rocketed through the ranks, until this underdog chose to do the unthinkable: take on the heavyweight champ of the world, the unstoppable Max Baer, renowned for having killed two men in the ring.::Sujit R.

        "Fact-based story of depression era boxing champ James J. Braddock. The film opens with Braddock winning a fight in 1928 and becoming a contender for a championship bout. The film then quickly jumps five years into the future. The depression is on and Braddock has had a series of defeats. Fighting injured, including with a broken hand, made him less of a fighter. Braddock, like many others in that era, lost everything in the stock market and scrimping by on the small fights he can get and on dock work. His wife would prefer he quit boxing, but knows how badly they need the money to get by with their three kids. Watering down milk just to make it do for several more days is a common occurrence. When his trainer manages to get him one more fight on the spur of the moment against the current #2 contender, Braddock rises to the occasion and knocks him out. His amazing comeback becomes the source of inspiration of many down-on-their-luck Americans. A series of fights later leads to the championship match against the arrogant champ, Max Baer. Baer, who had already killed two men in the ring, urges the older Braddock not to fight him. Of course, Braddock feels he has nothing more to lose and very devastating, intense fight ensues. Contains very brutal boxing violence.::John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net>",
