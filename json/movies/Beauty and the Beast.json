        "To pay the heavy price of pride for failing to look past one's superficial beauty, a powerful enchantress curses a self-absorbed and cold-hearted French prince to a life of solitude, transforming him into an appalling monster, and the castle's servants into ordinary but sentient household objects. But, as the years pass by in the desolate palace, an inadvertent mistake will condemn the kind and rebellious book-lover, Belle, to imprisonment within the thick-walled fortress, as the enchanted mansion's lord desperately seeks love's warm embrace. The Beast trembles with fear knowing that his time is short, yet hope still lies in a frail rose's last petal. Will Belle lift in time the veil that shrouds the bewitched aristocrat?::Nick Riganas",
        "A selfish prince is cursed to become a monster for the rest of his life, unless he learns to fall in love with a beautiful young woman he keeps prisoner.::Anonymous"
