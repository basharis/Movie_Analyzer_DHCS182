{1175}{1226}(Down In New Orleans Prologue)
{1227}{1342}/The Evening Star is shining bright
{1371}{1482}/So make a wish and hold on tight
{1519}{1630}/There's magic in the air tonight
{1667}{1761}/And anything can happen
{1804}{1856}"Just at that moment,
{1857}{1890}"the ugly little frog
{1891}{1981}looked up with his sad,|round eyes and pleaded,
{1982}{2046}"'Oh, please, dear princess,
{2047}{2139}"'only a kiss from you can|break this terrible spell
{2140}{2220}"'that was inflicted on|me by a wicked witch!'"
{2221}{2290}Here comes my favorite part.
{2291}{2351}"And the beautiful princess
{2352}{2431}was so moved by his desperate plea
{2432}{2564}"that she stooped down, picked|up the slippery creature,
{2565}{2686}"leaned forward, raised him to her lips,
{2687}{2791}"and kissed that little frog!
{2799}{2916}"Then, the frog was transformed|into a handsome prince.
{2917}{3076}"They were married and lived|happily ever after. The end."
{3106}{3148}Read it again! Read it again!
{3149}{3218}Sorry, Charlotte. It's time|for us to be heading home.
{3219}{3251}Say "good night," Tiana.
{3252}{3325}There is no way in this whole wide world
{3326}{3360}I would ever, ever, ever...
{3361}{3452}I mean, never kiss a frog. Yuck!
{3453}{3511}Is that so?
{3512}{3558}Well, here's your Prince Charming, Tia.
{3559}{3594}- Come on. Kiss him.|- No.
{3595}{3624}- Kiss him!|- Stop it!
{3625}{3693}- Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him!|- I won't, I won't, I won't!
{3694}{3759}I would do it. I would kiss a frog.
{3760}{3805}I would kiss a hundred frogs
{3806}{3938}if I could marry a prince|and be a princess.
{3988}{4093}You girls, stop tormenting|that poor little kitty.
{4094}{4176}Poor little thing.
{4239}{4264}Evening, Eudora.
{4265}{4368}Daddy! Daddy! Look at my|new dress. Isn't it pretty?
{4369}{4399}Look at you.
{4400}{4431}Why, I'd expect nothing less
{4432}{4517}from the finest seamstress|in New Orleans.
{4518}{4554}I want that dress!
{4555}{4605}- Now, sugarplum...|- I want that one!
{4606}{4643}Please, please, please, please!
{4644}{4725}Eudora, you suppose you could|whip something up like that?
{4726}{4790}Anything for my best customer.
{4791}{4876}Come along, Tiana. Your daddy|should be home from work by now.
{4877}{4971}All right now, princess, you're|getting that dress, but that's it.
{4972}{5023}No more Mr. Pushover.
{5024}{5060}Now, who wants a puppy?
{5061}{5157}I do! I do! He's so cute!
{5749}{5799}Gumbo smells good, Tiana.
{5800}{5840}I think it's done, Daddy.
{5841}{5885}Yeah? Are you sure?
{5886}{5938}- Absolutely positive?|- Yes.
{5939}{6023}Okay, I'm about to put|this spoon in my...
{6024}{6082}Wait!
{6151}{6209}Done.
{6257}{6321}- What?|- Well, sweetheart,
{6322}{6413}this is the best gumbo I've ever tasted!
{6414}{6487}Come here. Eudora, our|little girl's got a gift.
{6488}{6523}I could've told you that.
{6524}{6607}A gift this special|just got to be shared.
{6608}{6680}Hey, everybody, I made gumbo!
{6681}{6709}That smells good!
{6710}{6764}I got some hush puppies,|Tiana. Here I come!
{6765}{6821}You know the thing about good food?
{6822}{6904}It brings folks together|from all walks of life.
{6905}{7013}It warms them right up and it puts|little smiles on their faces.
{7014}{7074}And when I open up my own restaurant,
{7075}{7151}I tell you, people are going|to line up for miles around
{7152}{7196}just to get a taste of my food.
{7197}{7235}Our food.
{7236}{7340}That's right, baby. Our food.
{7479}{7537}- Daddy! Look!|- Where are you going?
{7538}{7591}Charlotte's fairy tale book said
{7592}{7719}if you make a wish on the Evening|Star, it's sure to come true.
{7720}{7770}Well, you wish on that star, sweetheart.
{7771}{7859}Yes. You wish and you dream|with all your little heart.
{7860}{7912}But you remember, Tiana, that
{7913}{7991}that old star can only|take you part of the way.
{7992}{8066}You got to help it along with|some hard work of your own,
{8067}{8220}and then, yeah, you can do|anything you set your mind to.
{8221}{8291}Just promise your daddy one thing.
{8292}{8399}That you'll never, ever lose|sight of what's really important.
{8400}{8458}Okay?
{8504}{8586}See you in the morning, babycakes.
{8587}{8664}Get some sleep.
{8949}{9041}Please, please, please!
{9837}{9892}Well, Miss Tiana, rough night for tips,
{9893}{9998}but every little penny counts.
{10127}{10178}Don't you worry, Daddy.
{10179}{10241}We'll be there soon.

{16250}{16364}And he's staying in our|house as my personal guest.
{16365}{16406}Lottie, that's swell.
{16407}{16467}A little word of advice.|My mama always said,
{16468}{16584}"The quickest way to a man's|heart is through his stomach."
{16585}{16655}- That's it!|- What just happened?
{16656}{16728}Tia! You are a bona fide genius.
{16729}{16813}I'm going to need about 500|of your man-catching beignets
{16814}{16851}for my ball tonight.
{16852}{16935}Excuse me, Daddy. Will|this about cover it?
{16936}{17004}This should cover it just fine, Lottie.
{17005}{17093}This is it! I'm getting my restaurant!
{17094}{17159}Tonight my prince is finally coming.
{17160}{17285}And I sure as heck ain't letting him go!
{17419}{17511}Everything looks peachy-keen,|Mr. Fenner and Mr. Fenner.
{17512}{17608}We'll have all the paperwork ready to|sign, first thing after Mardi Gras.
{17609}{17666}I'll do you one better. Why|don't I sign them tonight
{17667}{17722}when I see y'all at the La|Bouffs' masquerade ball?
{17723}{17828}You drive a hard bargain, Tiana!
{17829}{17863}Table for one, please?
{17864}{17903}Mama.
{17904}{18004}Here's a little something|to help you get started.
{18005}{18087}Daddy's gumbo pot.
{18137}{18188}I know.
{18189}{18268}I miss him, too.
{18271}{18359}Well, now. Hurry up and open the door!
{18360}{18400}Just look at it, Mama.
{18401}{18502}Doesn't it just make you want to cry?
{18503}{18532}Yes.
{18533}{18595}The maitre d' is going to be|right where you're standing.
{18596}{18647}And over here, a gourmet kitchen!
{18648}{18746}And hanging from the ceiling,|a big old crystal chandelier!
{18747}{18810}You're your daddy's daughter, all right.
{18811}{18895}He used to go on and on about|this old sugar mill, too.
{18896}{18985}Babycakes, I'm sure this place|is going to be just wonderful,
{18986}{19040}but it's a shame you|are working so hard.
{19041}{19108}But how can I let up|now when I'm so close?
{19109}{19179}I got to make sure all Daddy's|hard work means something.
{19180}{19215}Tiana.
{19216}{19275}Your daddy may not have gotten|the place he always wanted,
{19276}{19348}but he had something better.
{19349}{19420}He had love.
{19425}{19481}And that's all I want|for you, sweetheart,
{19482}{19520}to meet your Prince Charming
{19521}{19591}and dance off into your|happily ever after.
{19592}{19686}Mama! I don't have time for dancing.
{19687}{19747}/That's just gonna|/have to wait a while
{19748}{19785}/How long we talking about here?
{19786}{19886}/Ain't got time for messing around
{19887}{19927}/And it's not my style
{19928}{19973}I want some grandkids!

{20055}{20155}/People taking the easy way
{20156}{20224}/But I know exactly where I'm going
{20225}{20297}/I'm getting closer|/and closer every day

{20592}{20676}/Trials and tribulations
{20677}{20740}/I've had my share
{20741}{20801}/There ain't nothing|/gonna stop me now
{20802}{20896}/'Cause I'm almost there
{20987}{21065}/I remember Daddy told me
{21066}{21157}/Fairy tales can come true
{21158}{21209}/You got to make them happen
{21210}{21272}/It all depends on you
{21273}{21358}/So I work real|/hard each and every day
{21359}{21449}/Now things for|/sure are going my way
{21450}{21504}/Just doing what I do
{21505}{21569}/Look out, boys, I'm coming through
{21570}{21658}/And I'm almost there
{21663}{21728}/I'm almost there
{21729}{21792}/People gonna come|/here from everywhere

{22204}{22312}/There's been|/trials and tribulations
{22313}{22381}/You know I've had my share
{22382}{22457}/But I've climbed a|/mountain I've crossed a river
{22458}{22532}/And I'm almost there
{22533}{22600}/I'm almost there
{22601}{22670}/I'm almost
{22688}{22747}/there
{23089}{23128}Excuse me!
{23129}{23233}You need a hand there, buddy?
{23382}{23438}Yes!
{23625}{23704}Sire! I've been looking|for you everywhere.
{23705}{23752}What a coincidence, Lawrence.
{23753}{23800}I have been avoiding you everywhere.
{23801}{23860}We're going to be late|for the masquerade.
{23861}{23935}Listen, Lawrence, listen!
{23936}{23989}It's jazz. It's jazz music!
{23990}{24061}It was born here.
{24062}{24116}Is beautiful, no?
{24117}{24171}No.
{24181}{24231}Dance with me, fat man.
{24232}{24260}Stay loose, Lawrence!
{24261}{24326}We're supposed to be at|the La Bouff estate by now!
{24327}{24468}Yes, yes, yes, but first I|buy everyone here a drink!
{24469}{24512}With what?
{24513}{24590}At this point, you have 2 choices,
{24591}{24641}woo and marry a rich young lady
{24642}{24715}or get a job!
{24794}{24871}All right. Fine. But first we dance!
{24872}{24903}No, this is idiocy!
{24904}{25070}For someone who cannot see his|feet, you're very light on them!
{25071}{25160}Is perfect! You finally|got into the music.
{25161}{25191}Do you get my joke?
{25192}{25253}Because your head|is... It's in the tuba.
{25254}{25285}- Get me out!|- All right.
{25286}{25363}Hold on. One...
{25399}{25513}How degrading! I've|never been so humiliated.

{31476}{31528}/You got what you wanted
{31529}{31627}/But you lost what you had
{31670}{31728}/Hush
{32126}{32186}Senator Johnson. Hey, Jimmy.
{32187}{32247}I hope you're leaving some of them|beignets for your constituents.
{32248}{32285}Here you go, piping hot.
{32286}{32368}Stella. Excuse me. Stella, no. No.
{32369}{32453}Okay, but just one.
{32458}{32566}But, Miss Charlotte, you|said "later" 2 hours ago.
{32567}{32637}Travis, when a woman says "later,"
{32638}{32695}she really means "not ever."
{32696}{32723}Now run along.
{32724}{32838}There are plenty of young fillies dying|for you to waltz them into a stupor.
{32839}{32887}- Give me them napkins, quick!|- What on earth for?
{32888}{32952}I swear, I'm sweating|like a sinner in church.
{32953}{33005}Tia, it's getting to be so late!
{33006}{33039}There's still a few stragglers.
{33040}{33126}It's just not fair! My|prince is never coming!
{33127}{33197}- Now, Lottie...|- I never get anything I wish for!
{33198}{33234}Lottie, wait!
{33235}{33277}Just calm down. Take a deep...
{33278}{33325}Maybe I just got to wish harder.
{33326}{33413}Please, please, please,|please, please, please!
{33414}{33487}Lottie, you can't just wish on|a star and expect things...
{33488}{33536}Ladies and gentlemen!
{33537}{33650}His Royal Highness, Prince Naveen!
{34719}{34795}Evening, Tiana. Marvelous party.
{34796}{34875}Evening, Mr. Fenner and Mr. Fenner.
{34876}{34916}Fine-smelling beignets.
{34917}{34996}Going to be the house specialty once|I sign those papers y'all brought.
{34997}{35074}Yes. About that.
{35075}{35123}You were outbid.
{35124}{35164}- What?|- A fellow came in,
{35165}{35227}offered the full amount in cash.
{35228}{35284}Unless you can top his|offer by Wednesday...
{35285}{35335}You can kiss that place goodbye.
{35336}{35418}You know how long it took|me to save that money?
{35419}{35453}Exactly!
{35454}{35537}Which is why a little|woman of your background
{35538}{35621}would have had her hands full trying|to run a big business like that.
{35622}{35672}No, you're better off where you're at.
{35673}{35717}- Now, wait a minute...|- Love those beignets, though.
{35718}{35835}Now, hold on there! You come back...
{35910}{36021}Tia! Time to hit Prince Charming|with those man-catching...
{36022}{36047}What happened?
{36048}{36140}- I... I just...|- You poor dear.
{36141}{36216}Prince Naveen, we'll|be right back, sugar!
{36217}{36298}I got just the dress for you.
{36299}{36393}Tia, honey, did you see|the way he danced with me?
{36394}{36469}A marriage proposal can't be far behind.
{36470}{36538}Thank you, Evening Star!
{36539}{36647}You know, I was starting to think|that wishing on stars was just for--
{36648}{36742}babies and crazy people.
{36773}{36827}Look at you.
{36828}{36946}Aren't you just as pretty|as a magnolia in May?
{36947}{37032}Seems like only yesterday|we were both little girls
{37033}{37103}dreaming our fairy tale dreams,
{37104}{37186}and tonight they're finally coming true.
{37187}{37281}Well, back into the fray.
{37282}{37329}Wish me luck!
{37330}{37395}Naveen...
{37596}{37657}/Almost
{37760}{37833}/Almost there
{37858}{37958}/People would have|/come from everywhere
{37959}{38032}/I was almost
{38058}{38117}/there
{38417}{38526}I cannot believe I'm doing this.
{38545}{38637}Please, please, please.
{38849}{38918}Very funny.
{38923}{39026}So what now? I reckon you want a kiss?
{39027}{39127}Kissing would be nice, yes?
{39159}{39207}I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
{39208}{39273}I did not mean to scare|you. I... Wait, no, no, no!
{39274}{39326}Wait. Hold on a sec...
{39327}{39379}You have a very strong arm, Princess.
{39380}{39470}Okay, please! Put the monkey down.
{39471}{39499}Stay back or I'll...
{39500}{39570}Please, please, please.
{39571}{39623}Allow me to introduce myself.
{39624}{39706}I am Prince Naveen
{39742}{39789}of Maldonia.
{39790}{39883}Prince? But I didn't wish for any...
{39884}{39966}Hold on. If you're the prince,
{39967}{40010}then-then who...
{40011}{40113}was that waltzing with|Lottie on the dance floor?
{40114}{40176}All I know is one minute I am a prince,
{40177}{40227}charming and handsome, cutting a rug,
{40228}{40336}and then the next thing I|know, I am tripping over these.
{40337}{40406}Wait, wait, wait!
{40407}{40484}I know this story!
{40485}{40539}- The Frog Prince?|- Yes!
{40540}{40657}My mother had the servants|read this to me every night.
{40658}{40709}Yes, yes, yes!
{40710}{40755}This is exactly the answer!
{40756}{40827}You must kiss me.
{40828}{40885}Excuse me?
{40886}{40910}You will enjoy, I guarantee.
{40911}{40993}All women enjoy the|kiss of Prince Naveen.
{40994}{41073}Come. We pucker.
{41097}{41132}That's new.
{41133}{41180}Look, I'm sorry.
{41181}{41249}I'd really like to|help you, but I just--
{41250}{41315}do not kiss frogs.
{41316}{41400}Wait a sec, but on the|balcony, you asked me.
{41401}{41439}I didn't expect you to answer!
{41440}{41479}But you must kiss me.
{41480}{41558}Look, besides being|unbelievably handsome, okay,
{41559}{41631}I also happen to come from|a fabulously wealthy family.
{41632}{41687}Surely I could offer|you some type of reward,
{41688}{41748}a wish I could grant, perhaps?
{41749}{41805}Yes?
{41824}{41889}Just one kiss?
{41890}{42003}Just one, unless you beg for more.
{42292}{42345}Okay, Tiana, you can do|this. You can do this.
{42346}{42480}Just a little kiss. Just|a little kiss. Okay.
{42823}{42872}You don't look that much different,
{42873}{42924}but how did you get way up there?
{42925}{43054}And how did I get way|down here in all this...
{43055}{43090}Easy, Princess. Princess, do not panic!
{43091}{43194}What did you do to me?|I'm green and I'm slimy!
{43195}{43262}- No! No, no, no, that is not slime.|- What?
{43263}{43392}- You are secreting mucus.|- You... You...
{43875}{43938}Hey, Stella!
{43939}{43976}Get them frogs!
{43977}{44051}- Run!|- I can't run. I'm a frog!
{44052}{44117}Then hop!
{44119}{44223}Down, boy. Down, monster dog!
{44228}{44275}En garde!
{44276}{44324}- Look out! Out of the way!|- No!
{44325}{44371}- Where are we going?|- Excuse me!
{44372}{44495}- I can't see a thing!|- Neither can I!
{44559}{44602}- Wait! Stella!|- Going up!
{44603}{44716}- Stella, it's me, Tiana!|- Tiana?
{44736}{44800}Stella just talked to me.|The dog just spoke to me!
{44801}{44875}You know, if you're going to let|every little thing bother you,
{44876}{44991}it's going to be a very long night!
{45164}{45211}Dear.
{45212}{45248}You're so quiet.
{45249}{45282}You let him go?
{45283}{45459}The poor devil was gasping, so I|loosened the lid ever so slightly.
{45484}{45592}Now how did I ever get tangled|up in all this voodoo madness?
{45593}{45697}I can't go through with this!
{45768}{45833}You wear this ghastly thing!
{45834}{45876}Careful with that!
{45877}{46002}Anything happens to|this, I'm going to be...
{46003}{46083}Fun fact about voodoo, Larry.
{46084}{46145}Can't conjure a thing for myself.
{46146}{46169}Besides,
{46170}{46288}you and I both know the real|power in this world ain't magic.
{46289}{46337}It's money!
{46338}{46387}Buckets of it.
{46388}{46432}- That's true.|- Aren't you tired
{46433}{46472}of living on the margins
{46473}{46520}while all those fat cats|in their fancy cars
{46521}{46589}don't give you so much|as a sideways glance?
{46590}{46652}Yes. I am.
{46653}{46736}All you got to do is marry|Big Daddy's little princess,
{46737}{46831}and we'll be splitting that juicy La|Bouff fortune right down the middle.
{46832}{46923}- 60-40, like I said.|- Yeah.
{46924}{46984}But what about Naveen?
{46985}{47086}Your little slip-up will be|a minor bump in the road,
{47087}{47189}so long as we've got the|prince's blood in this.
{47190}{47246}Yes.
{47304}{47355}Voodoo?
{47356}{47392}You mean to tell me this all happened
{47393}{47440}because you were messing|with the Shadow Man?
{47441}{47511}He was very charismatic.
{47512}{47556}It serves me right for wishing on stars.
{47557}{47632}The only way to get what you want|in this world is through hard work.
{47633}{47764}Hard work? Why would a|princess need to work hard?
{47765}{47821}I'm not a princess. I'm a waitress.
{47822}{47852}A waitress?
{47853}{47928}Well, no wonder the kiss did|not work. You lied to me!
{47929}{47981}No, I... I never said I was a princess.
{47982}{48038}You never said that you were a waitress!
{48039}{48078}You... You were wearing a crown!
{48079}{48170}It was a costume party, you|spoiled little rich boy!
{48171}{48246}Yes? Well, the egg is on|your face, all right?
{48247}{48313}- Because I do not have any riches.|- What?
{48314}{48404}I am completely broke!
{48800}{48873}You said you were fabulously wealthy!
{48874}{48975}No. My parents are fabulously wealthy,|but they cut me off for being a...
{48976}{49007}Leech! Leech!
{49008}{49158}You're broke, and you had|the gall to call me a liar?
{49167}{49258}It was not a lie. I fully...
{49259}{49297}Run!
{49298}{49354}I fully intend to be rich again.
{49355}{49423}Once I marry Miss Charlotte La|Bouff. If she will have me.
{49424}{49462}- You're a prince?|- Obviously.
{49463}{49542}She'll have you.
{49652}{49682}All right, then.
{49683}{49747}Once you two are married, you|are going to keep your promise
{49748}{49789}and get me my restaurant, right?
{49790}{49884}Not so fast. I made that promise to|a beautiful princess, not a cranky...
{49885}{49983}Why are those logs moving?
{49996}{50078}Those aren't logs.
{50122}{50220}I got dibs on the big one.
{50337}{50412}Where'd they go?
{50413}{50466}- Where'd they go?|- I saw him first!
{50467}{50526}Come here, you plump, tasty morsel!
{50527}{50567}That's my tail, pea brain!
{50568}{50647}Where did they go? Come on!
{50648}{50684}Lower the vine.
{50685}{50741}Find your own tree.
{50742}{50775}- There he is!|- I see him! I see him!
{50776}{50827}All right. Look, look. Help|me get out of this swamp,
{50828}{50892}and once I marry Charlotte, I|shall get you your restaurant.
{50893}{50999}You're going to taste so good|basted and battered and fried!
{51000}{51029}Quick, quick! Pull me up!
{51030}{51079}You can hop, but you can't hide.
{51080}{51152}We got all night.
{51153}{51230}Well, waitress, looks like we're|going to be here for a while.
{51231}{51336}So we may as well get comfortable.
{51337}{51383}Keep your slimy self away from me!
{51384}{51511}I told you, it is not|slime! It is mucus!
{51729}{51796}Rise and shine, sleeping|beauty! Gators are gone.
{51797}{51828}What?
{51829}{51922}We got to get back to New Orleans|and undo this mess you got us into.
{51923}{52035}I was not the one parading around|with a phony-baloney tiara.
{52036}{52095}Music to paddle by.
{52096}{52163}I could use a little help.
{52164}{52266}I will play a little louder.
{52301}{52424}How about a little less picking and a...
{52425}{52542}I know that tune! Dippermouth Blues!
{52628}{52709}Play it, brother!
{52727}{52785}Yeah!
{52893}{52924}Where you been all my life?
{52925}{52977}Where did you learn to play like that?
{52978}{53035}Why, the bayou's the best|jazz school in the world.
{53036}{53079}All the greats play the riverboats.
{53080}{53196}Old Louis would give anything to be|up there jamming with the big boys.
{53197}{53306}- Why don't you?|- I tried once.
{53518}{53574}It didn't end well.
{53575}{53648}It has been a real pleasure|meeting you, Louis.
{53649}{53744}And thank you kindly for not eating|us, but we best be on our way.
{53745}{53791}Where... Where y'all going?
{53792}{53843}To find somebody to break this spell.
{53844}{53869}What spell?
{53870}{53934}Brace yourself, my scaly friend.
{53935}{53992}We are not frogs.
{53993}{54068}We are humans.
{54130}{54157}Y'all serious?
{54158}{54229}I am Naveen, Prince of Maldonia.
{54230}{54292}And she is Tiana, the waitress.
{54293}{54323}Do not kiss her.
{54324}{54380}Now, just a second.
{54381}{54459}This goon here got himself turned into|a frog by a voodoo man, and now...
{54460}{54534}Voodoo? Like the kind Mama Odie do?
{54535}{54562}Mama who-dee?
{54563}{54647}Mama Odie. She the voodoo|queen of the bayou.
{54648}{54754}She got magic and spells,|all kind of hoodoo.
{54755}{54790}- Could you take us to her?|- Could you take us to her?
{54791}{54872}Through the deepest,|darkest part of the bayou?
{54873}{54992}Facing razor-sharp pricker bushes|and trappers and hunters with guns?
{54993}{55047}No.
{55100}{55167}Watch and learn.
{55168}{55262}Louis, it is too bad we cannot|help you with your dream.
{55263}{55372}If only you were smaller, less toothy,
{55373}{55476}you could play jazz to adoring|crowds without scaring them.
{55477}{55581}Anyway, enjoy your|loneliness, my friend.
{55582}{55646}Cute, but it's not going to...
{55647}{55714}Hey, guys, I just had me a crazy idea!
{55715}{55776}What if I ask Mama|Odie to turn me human?
{55777}{55832}Louis! You are a genius!
{55833}{55902}Hallelujah!
{55997}{56100}/If I were a human being I'd|/head straight for New Orleans
{56101}{56157}/And I'd blow this|/horn so hot and strong
{56158}{56208}/Like no one they've ever seen
{56209}{56272}/You heard of Louis Armstrong
{56273}{56324}/Mr. Sidney Bechet
{56325}{56422}/All those boys gonna step aside|/when they hear this old ex-gator play
{56423}{56484}/Listen
{56509}{56567}Yeah!
{56649}{56747}/When I'm human as I hope to be
{56748}{56803}/I'm gonna blow this|/horn till the cows come home
{56804}{56876}/And everyone's gonna bow down to me
{56877}{56919}Thank you, thank you.
{56920}{57029}Thank you. I love you, too, baby.
{57030}{57128}/When I'm myself again|/I want just the life I had
{57129}{57240}/A great big party every|/night That doesn't sound too bad
{57241}{57345}/A redhead on my left|/arm A brunette on my right
{57346}{57432}/A blonde or 2 to hold the candles|/Now that seems just about right
{57433}{57460}Eh, Louis?
{57461}{57506}/Life is short When|/you're done, you're done
{57507}{57562}/We're on this|/earth to have some fun
{57563}{57615}/- And that's the way things are|- Tell it, brother!
{57616}{57717}/When I'm human, and I'm gonna be
{57718}{57831}/I'm gonna tear it up like I did|/before And that's a royal guarantee
{57832}{57894}You are getting married!
{57895}{57985}Right. I'll just have to leave a|string of broken hearts behind me!
{57986}{58089}/Your modesty becomes you|/and your sense of responsibility
{58090}{58150}/I've worked hard|/for everything I've got
{58151}{58203}/And that's the|/way it's supposed to be
{58204}{58306}/When I'm a human being|/at least I'll act like one
{58307}{58370}/If you do your|/best each and every day
{58371}{58421}/Good things are|/sure to come your way
{58422}{58473}/What you give is what you get

{58945}{59014}/When we're
{59054}{59113}/Human
{59382}{59464}Prince Naveen, dear, I|am positively mortified
{59465}{59560}you had to endure that|frog fiasco last night.
{59561}{59640}Well, when you're next|in line for the throne,
{59641}{59704}you're poised like a panther,
{59705}{59812}ready to expect the unexpected.
{59906}{59937}Your ear?
{59938}{59996}What?
{60107}{60175}Those pesky mosquitoes.
{60176}{60269}They're everywhere. Please.
{60270}{60348}Miss Charlotte, I can no longer ignore
{60349}{60437}the throbbing of my--
{60455}{60502}heart.
{60503}{60613}Even though our time together has|been brief, it's been heavenly!
{60614}{60712}Land sakes, Prince Naveen!
{60720}{60776}You got me blushing like a...
{60777}{60835}Would you do me the honor of becoming
{60836}{60924}Princess of Maldonia?
{60937}{60989}Are you serious?
{60990}{61029}As the plague.
{61030}{61060}Yes!
{61061}{61129}I most definitely will marry you!
{61130}{61172}There's so much to plan!|I mean, the guest list,
{61173}{61254}the dress, the music,|the flowers, the shoes...
{61255}{61401}We're going to have ourselves|a Mardi Gras wedding!
{61457}{61511}No!
{61522}{61553}What do we do now?
{61554}{61643}Because somebody let our|froggy prince go, Larry,
{61644}{61769}I'm reduced to asking for help|from my friends on the other side.
{61770}{61836}Now, this restaurant of yours,|is it going to have étouffée?
{61837}{61909}Jambalaya, gumbo. It's|going to have it all.
{61910}{62015}I've always wanted to try red beans|and rice, muffulettas, po' boys.
{62016}{62054}Stop, Louis.
{62055}{62174}You two are making me so very hungry.
{62195}{62259}Interesting.
{62260}{62319}What are you doing?
{62320}{62424}You are frightening the food.
{62447}{62551}This is harder than it looks.
{62744}{62816}What? No, no...
{62817}{62969}There is no way I am kissing a frog|and eating a bug on the same day.
{62970}{63039}No! No, no.
{63324}{63393}- Hello.|- Hold still.
{63394}{63458}Stop moving! You are making|this very difficult!
{63459}{63549}Y'all find anything to eat yet? Oh, my.
{63550}{63594}Hang on. Old Louis got it covered.
{63595}{63684}- No, no...|- Don't...
{63685}{63738}How's that?
{63739}{63800}This could be a little better.
{63801}{63830}You know what this needs?
{63831}{63924}A sharp stick! Be right back.
{63925}{63977}- This is all your fault.|- My fault? My fault...
{63978}{64049}Let me tell you something. I was|having a wonderful time until...
{64050}{64120}Coo! Well, looky here!
{64121}{64211}Girl, I guess you and your boyfriend|got a little carried away. Am I right?
{64212}{64245}- No, no!|- Do not be ridiculous!
{64246}{64317}- He's not my boyfriend!|- I am the Prince of Maldonia!
{64318}{64441}Let me shine a little|light on the situation.
{64442}{64546}Excuse me. One more time now.
{64634}{64684}That's more better. Yeah.
{64685}{64740}It's okay, baby. I don't explode me.
{64741}{64784}I ain't no firecracker!
{64785}{64858}I just got my big butt|glowing! That's right!
{64859}{64945}The women like a man|with a big back porch!
{64946}{65016}Lord, you done this up|real good, for sure.
{65017}{65059}Now where this go to at?
{65060}{65156}Hang on, Cap. I'm just going|to give a little twist here.
{65157}{65237}We're getting to know each other now!

{65970}{66070}Go to bed! Y'all from Shreveport?
{66071}{66140}No. no. We are people.
{66141}{66199}Prince Charming here got|himself turned into a frog

{66237}{66269}Well, there you go.
{66270}{66305}And we were on our way to Mama Odie's.
{66306}{66341}We think maybe she can...
{66342}{66429}Mama Odie? Y'all headed the|wrong directional, chère.
{66430}{66499}Now what kind of chucklehead|told y'all to go this way?
{66500}{66579}I found a stick!
{66605}{66643}Louis.
{66644}{66749}Ray here says you've been taking|us in the wrong direction.
{66750}{66786}I was... Well, listen.
{66787}{66881}I was confused by the|topography and the geography
{66882}{66916}and the choreography and...
{66917}{67046}First rule of the bayou, never|take direction from a gator.
{67047}{67193}Why, me and my relationals|will help show y'all the way.

{71758}{71790}Evangeline?
{71791}{71906}She the most prettiest|firefly ever did glow.
{71907}{71989}You know, I talk to|Evangeline most every night.
{71990}{72058}She's kind of shy. Don't say much.
{72059}{72104}And I know in my heart

{72224}{72283}- That's so sweet.|- Yeah, so sweet.
{72284}{72361}Just do not settle down|so quickly, my friend.

{72749}{72842}Will you hold still, you big baby?
{72843}{72935}I ain't touched it yet.
{73016}{73108}Take a look at them 2 jumpers.
{73109}{73168}I can taste them frog legs already.
{73169}{73253}Bet they taste real good with|the sauce piquant, right, Pa?
{73254}{73340}Will you keep quiet?
{73465}{73527}My thoughts exactly, Two Fingers.
{73528}{73641}It is time to catch us some frogs!
{73771}{73800}You know, waitress,

{74340}{74413}- What did you say?|- Nothing.
{74414}{74473}- Stick in the mud.|- Listen here, mister.

{74597}{74686}chasing chambermaids|around your ivory tower!

{94679}{94757}I need to dig a little|deeper and work even harder
{94758}{94841}to get my restaurant.
{94842}{94905}All right, y'all, one more time!
{94906}{94946}/It don't matter what you look like
{94947}{94973}/It don't...
{94974}{95062}Nobody is going to sing with Ray? Okay.
{95063}{95134}Well, if y'all are set on being human,
{95135}{95223}there's only one way.
{95242}{95325}Gumbo, gumbo in the pot.
{95326}{95435}We need a princess, whatcha got?
{95503}{95563}Lottie? But she's not a princess.
{95564}{95625}Hush up and look at the gumbo.
{95626}{95659}Ta-da!
{95660}{95763}That's right. Big Daddy's King|of the Mardi Gras parade.
{95764}{95871}So that makes Lottie a princess.
{95872}{95929}- Does that count?|- Yes, it does,
{95930}{96043}but only till midnight|when Mardi Gras is over.
{96044}{96164}Hop-along, you only got till then|to get that princess to kiss you.
{96165}{96247}Once she does, boom!
{96248}{96309}You both turn human!
{96310}{96361}- Midnight?|- That doesn't give us much time at all.
{96362}{96394}What about me, Mama?
{96395}{96473}I want to be human, too, so I|can play jazz with the big boys.
{96474}{96524}I want fingers and toes|and a bellybutton.
{96525}{96569}Not the kind that sticks out|but the kind that goes in.
{96570}{96681}Jabber Jaws, you dig a little deeper,|you'll find everything you need.
{96682}{96731}Come on, come on, come on.
{96732}{96776}There's a lot of river|between here and New Orleans.
{96777}{96812}Y'all best get to swimming.
{96813}{96911}Wait! I got a better idea.
{97219}{97294}They got guns!
{97388}{97485}Man, that is one killer-diller costume!
{97486}{97592}Hey, gator, can you blow that horn?
{97593}{97737}Come on. Sit in with us!|We're playing Mardi Gras.
{97824}{97858}We can't miss this!
{97859}{97957}Little Louis going to finally|play with the big boys!
{97958}{98029}Naveen, you coming?
{98030}{98134}I'll catch up with you later.
{98470}{98576}Evangeline. Why can't I just|look Tiana in the eye and say,
{98577}{98692}"I will do whatever it takes to make|all your dreams come true because...
{98693}{98735}"Because I love you"?
{98736}{98814}Cap! You making goo-goo eyes at my girl?
{98815}{98877}That's it! Put them up! I'm going|to make some shoes out of you!
{98878}{98922}No, Ray! I am not in|love with Evangeline.
{98923}{98997}I am in love with Tiana!
{98998}{99061}I knew it, I knew it!|You come here, you.
{99062}{99105}And I can no longer marry|Miss Charlotte La Bouff.
{99106}{99132}You're going to be happy together!
{99133}{99168}I'll find another way to|get Tiana a restaurant.
{99169}{99207}You're going to have the|cutest little tadpoles!
{99208}{99265}I will get a job. Maybe 2. Maybe 3.
{99266}{99309}I can't wait to tell chère!
{99310}{99391}No, no, no. I must tell her. Alone.
{99392}{99474}Right. You rascal!
{99564}{99600}Where you taking me?
{99601}{99661}I just wanted to show|you a little something
{99662}{99798}to celebrate our last|night together as frogs.
{99893}{100052}All my years no one's ever done|anything like this for me.
{100089}{100177}It is too much, is it|not? Thank you, Beaux.
{100178}{100223}I thought it was a nice touch.
{100224}{100377}Pretend you did not see that.|Please, please, sit down.
{100397}{100433}- What's this?|- Ta-da!
{100434}{100481}- You minced.|- I did!
{100482}{100535}You have had quite an influence on me,
{100536}{100637}which is amazing because I have|dated thousands of women and...
{100638}{100731}No, like 2, 3, just other|women. And anyway, listen.
{100732}{100769}You could not be more|different, you know?
{100770}{100831}You are practically one of the guys.
{100832}{100952}No, no, no. You are not a|guy. Let me begin again.
{100953}{101072}I'm not myself tonight.|Tiana! Sorry, that was loud.
{101073}{101194}- This is a disaster.|- No. It's cute.
{101225}{101327}- Tiana, I...|- There it is!
{101378}{101405}Your restaurant?
{101406}{101483}Can't you just picture it? All|lit up like the 4th of July.
{101484}{101560}- Yes. Jazz pouring out of every window!|- It should be elegant.
{101561}{101608}But you got to keep it loose,|though. Got to let it swing.
{101609}{101689}- You know a good ukulele player?|- Really? You'd let me perform?
{101690}{101785}I'll talk to the owner. Owner says yes.
{101786}{101857}Folks are going to be coming|together from all walks of life
{101858}{101933}just to get a taste of our food.
{101934}{101999}Our food?
{102022}{102085}No. My daddy.
{102086}{102150}We always wanted to|open this restaurant.
{102151}{102226}He died before he could see it happen.
{102227}{102357}But tomorrow, with your help,|our dream is finally coming true.
{102358}{102405}- Tomorrow?|- If I don't deliver that money
{102406}{102546}first thing tomorrow, I|lose this place forever.
{102575}{102648}Tiana, I love
{102717}{102845}the way you light up when|you talk about your dream.
{102846}{102929}A dream that... It is so beautiful, I...
{102930}{103074}I promise I will do whatever|it takes to make it come true.
{103075}{103166}Port of New Orleans, all ashore!
{103167}{103265}I'll go round up the boys.
{103575}{103638}Evangeline,
{103639}{103765}I've always been so sure about|what I wanted, but now I...
{103766}{103821}What do I do?
{103822}{103899}Please tell me.
{103995}{104048}Prince Naveen, darling.
{104049}{104154}You better hurry up. Don't want to|be late for our Mardi Gras wedding.
{104155}{104264}Getting dressed! Just a few|more minutes, my dearest heart.
{104265}{104352}Okay, honey lamb. We'll be|waiting in the Packard.
{104353}{104413}Daddy, start the car!
{104414}{104482}My heavens, I'm doomed!
{104483}{104673}No, Larry! I'm the one who's doomed.|Unless we get that frog's blood in...
{104773}{104860}We are back in business, boys!
{104861}{104943}Get your filthy hands off me! Lawrence!
{104944}{105049}Now hold still, Your Eminence.
{105086}{105163}Mardi Gras! Mardi Gras!
{105164}{105235}Ray! Have you seen Naveen?
{105236}{105300}Look at you. Where the ring at?
{105301}{105349}What are you talking about?
{105350}{105410}Well, if Cap didn't say nothing,|I ain't going to say nothing
{105411}{105461}because old Ray's sealed|up tight as a drum.
{105462}{105510}- You ain't getting nothing out of me, no!|- Ray.
{105511}{105558}Okay, Cap not going to marry|Charlotte, he going to marry you!
{105559}{105600}Soon as he gets himself kissed|and y'all both turn human,
{105601}{105661}he's going to find a job,|get you that restaurant...
{105662}{105694}I said too much, didn't I?
{105695}{105837}You said just enough, Ray!|Thank you, Evangeline.
{105999}{106100}He was trying to propose! That's|what all that fumbling was about!
{106101}{106208}And here I thought all he wanted|was to marry a rich girl!
{106209}{106257}What are we looking for again?
{106258}{106347}You just keep your eyes out|for the biggest, gaudiest float
{106348}{106464}with a Mardi Gras princess|about to kiss herself a...
{106465}{106496}A frog.
{106497}{106580}Dearly beloved, we are|gathered here tonight
{106581}{106660}in this fine celebration|to join together
{106661}{106731}this prince and this young woman
{106732}{106793}in holy matrimony.
{106794}{106860}No. This can't be right, darling.
{106861}{107005}And how you can still be|a frog? Mama Odie, she...
{107362}{107474}I know what we seen with our eyes,
{107475}{107510}but if we just go back that way,
{107511}{107589}we're going to find out|your fairy tale come true.
{107590}{107672}Just because you wish for|something doesn't make it true.
{107673}{107721}It's like my Evangeline|always said to me...
{107722}{107786}Evangeline is nothing but a star, Ray!
{107787}{107896}A big ball of hot air a|million miles from here!
{107897}{108022}Open your eyes now, before you get hurt.
{108192}{108315}She just speaking out a broken|heart. That's all that is.
{108316}{108376}Come on, Evangeline.
{108377}{108456}We're going to show chère the truth!
{108457}{108576}If any of you objects to|the union of these 2 people,
{108577}{108647}speak now or forever hold your peace.
{108648}{108700}Me! Me! I object!
{108701}{108808}Do you, Prince Naveen, take|Charlotte to be your wife?
{108809}{108905}Cap, what you doing, son?
{108964}{109031}...as you both shall live?
{109032}{109124}What? I do! Yes, I'm for it.
{109125}{109176}- Do you, Charlotte La Bouff...|- Is that you, Cap?
{109177}{109227}Ray! Get me out of this box!
{109228}{109319}I can't hear you! I'm going|to get you out this box!
{109320}{109433}...to keep yourself only unto him,|as long as you both shall live?
{109434}{109476}I do.
{109477}{109578}And so, by the power vested in|me by the state of Louisiana,
{109579}{109666}I now pronounce you man and...
{109667}{109742}Prince Naveen!
{109784}{109848}Goodness gracious! Are you all right?
{109849}{109915}I just need a moment to compose myself.
{109916}{109959}Cheese and crackers!
{109960}{110008}Lawrence, why are you doing this?
{110009}{110115}As payback for all those|years of humiliation.
{110116}{110236}Get your royal rump back on that|wedding cake and finish this deal!
{110237}{110293}What's he doing? Stop him!
{110294}{110338}Give it to me!
{110339}{110406}I've got it! It got me, too.
{110407}{110522}- Let go of that!|- Stay out of sight!
{110523}{110604}Come on. Come on.
{110719}{110775}Ray?
{110806}{110896}Hey, why did you stop?
{110900}{110982}He's a real gator!
{111039}{111064}Ray?
{111065}{111128}This proves what we saw|ain't what we thought we saw!
{111129}{111190}- What is this?|- It's a voodoo hayacall.
{111191}{111285}The Shadow Man, he been|using it for the...
{111286}{111342}You can't let Shadow Man|get this, no matter what!
{111343}{111403}Now run, girl! Run!
{111404}{111506}Don't make me light my butt!
{111552}{111652}I'm going to get you! I got a|lot more of me! Come here, you!
{111653}{111722}Who's next?
{112012}{112068}Ray!
{112117}{112173}Ray?
{112375}{112548}Back off, or I'm going to break|this thing into a million pieces!
{112972}{113033}Naveen?
{113111}{113163}Now, isn't this a whole lot better
{113164}{113258}than hopping around the bayou|for the rest of your life?
{113259}{113328}Shadow Man.
{113333}{113376}Got to hand it to you, Tiana.
{113377}{113443}When you dream, you dream big.
{113444}{113499}Just look at this place.
{113500}{113610}Going to be the crown|jewel of the Crescent City!
{113611}{113702}And all you got to do|to make this a reality
{113703}{113803}is hand over that little|old talisman of mine.
{113804}{113890}No. This is not right.
{113891}{114007}Come on now, darling. Think of|everything you've sacrificed.
{114008}{114108}- Girl, all you ever do is work.|- I told y'all she wouldn't come.
{114109}{114180}Think of all those|naysayers who doubted you.
{114181}{114237}You ain't never going to get|enough for the down payment.
{114238}{114363}...little woman of your background,|you're better off where you're at.
{114364}{114471}And don't forget your poor daddy.
{114472}{114557}- Now that was one hard-working man.|- See you in the morning, James.
{114558}{114647}Double, sometime triple shifts.
{114648}{114758}Never letting on how bone tired|and beat down he really was.
{114759}{114837}- Daddy!|- Hey, babycakes!
{114838}{114891}Shame all that hard work
{114892}{114991}didn't amount to much more|than a busted-up old gumbo pot
{114992}{115085}and a dream that never|got off the back porch.
{115086}{115134}But you?
{115135}{115288}You can give your poor daddy|everything he ever wanted.
{115296}{115413}Come on, Tiana. You're almost there.
{115509}{115630}My daddy never did get what he wanted.
{115681}{115739}But he had what he needed.
{115740}{115829}He had love. He never lost sight|of what was really important.
{115830}{115970}- Easy with that. Careful.|- And neither will I!
{116099}{116161}Y'all should have taken my deal.
{116162}{116219}Now you're going to spend|the rest of your life
{116220}{116299}being a slimy, little frog.
{116300}{116353}I've got news for you, Shadow Man.
{116354}{116454}It's not slime. It's mucus!
{116498}{116559}No! No!
{116605}{116724}How am I ever going to pay back my debt?
{116725}{116761}Friends.
{116762}{116806}/Are you ready?
{116807}{116893}No! I'm not ready at all! In|fact, I got lots more plans.
{116894}{116932}/Are you ready?
{116933}{117029}This is just a minor setback|in a major operation.
{117030}{117099}As soon as I whip up another|spell, we'll be back in business!
{117100}{117171}I still got that froggy|prince locked away!
{117172}{117252}I just need a little more time.
{117253}{117322}No, please!
{117342}{117430}Just a little more time!
{117431}{117558}I promise I'll pay|y'all back! I promise!
{117661}{117719}/Hush
{117868}{117942}Prince! Prince Naveen!
{117943}{118089}Your shy and retiring|bride-to-be is getting antsy!
{118092}{118169}Hello, darling.
{118217}{118302}Miss La Bouff! Please, down here!
{118303}{118459}Allow me to introduce myself.|I am the real Prince Naveen!
{118460}{118505}Of Maldonia.
{118506}{118594}Did you say "Prince"?
{118610}{118687}Boys, drag this maggot|down to the parish prison.
{118688}{118761}I'm completely innocent! Now,|the Shadow Man bamboozled me!
{118762}{118843}Goodness gracious. This|is so much to absorb.
{118844}{118892}Let me see if I got this right.
{118893}{118996}If I kiss you before midnight, you|and Tiana will turn human again?
{118997}{119047}And then we're gonna|get ourselves married
{119048}{119120}and live happily ever after, the end!
{119121}{119175}Yeah, more or less. But remember,
{119176}{119264}you must give Tiana all the money|she requires for her restaurant.
{119265}{119340}Because Tiana,
{119382}{119460}she is my Evangeline.
{119461}{119531}Anything you want, sugar.
{119532}{119620}Pucker up, buttercup.
{119652}{119700}- Wait!|- Tiana?
{119701}{119755}- Tiana?|- Don't do this.
{119756}{119802}I have to do this. And we|are running out of time.
{119803}{119830}I won't let you!
{119831}{119887}It's the only way to get you your dream!
{119888}{119932}My dream?
{119933}{119999}My dream wouldn't be complete
{120000}{120082}without you in it.
{120136}{120220}I love you, Naveen.
{120287}{120398}- Warts and all?|- Warts and all.
{120494}{120629}All my life, I read about|true love in fairy tales
{120630}{120722}and, Tia, you found it!
{120742}{120815}I'll kiss him. For you, honey.
{120816}{120904}No marriage required.
{120956}{121092}My word! Maybe that old|clock's a little fast!
{121268}{121341}I'm so sorry.
{121371}{121446}Tiana! Naveen!
{121492}{121586}- Louis, what is it?|- Shadow Man done laid poor Ray low.
{121587}{121696}- Ray.|- He's hurting awful bad.
{122012}{122076}Hey, chère,
{122077}{122183}- how come you're still...|- We're staying frogs, Ray.
{122184}{122284}And we're staying together.
{122330}{122420}I like that very much.
{122433}{122533}Evangeline likes that, too.
{125385}{125496}And so by the power vested in me,
{125506}{125617}I now pronounce y'all frog and wife.
{125618}{125707}Get to it, Hop-along! Give|your lovely bride some sugar!
{125708}{125787}Congratulations.
{126070}{126160}This going to be good!
{126801}{126903}Like I told y'all, kissing|a princess breaks the spell.
{126904}{126989}Once you became my|wife, that made you...
{126990}{127099}A princess. You just kissed|yourself a princess.
{127100}{127204}And I'm about to do it again.
{127941}{128043}(Down In New Orleans Finale)
{128530}{128608}/In the south land, there's a city
{128609}{128678}/Way down on the river
{128679}{128836}/Where the women are very|/pretty And all the men deliver
{128840}{128910}/They got music, it's always playing
{128911}{128992}/Start in the daytime|/Go all through the night
{128993}{129071}/And when you hear|/that music playing
{129072}{129157}/Hear what I'm saying|/make you feel all right
{129158}{129254}Who would have thought the prince|would've had a younger brother!
{129255}{129304}How old did you say you were?
{129305}{129373}I'm 6 and a half.
{129374}{129460}Well, I've waited this long.
{129461}{129536}/Grab somebody, come on down
{129537}{129612}/Bring your paintbrush|/We're painting the town
{129613}{129730}/There's some sweetness going around
{129736}{129800}/Dreams do come true
{129801}{129878}/In New Orleans
{130157}{130245}(Never Knew I Needed)
{130255}{130366}/For the way you changed my plans
{130417}{130530}/For being the perfect distraction

{130638}{130720}/Of everything that I wanted to have
{130721}{130853}/And made me see there|/was something missing
{130854}{130902}/Oh, yeah
{130903}{131014}/For the ending of my first begin
{131065}{131185}/And for the rare|/and unexpected friend
{131186}{131283}/For the way you're|/something that I'd never choose
{131284}{131374}/But at the same time|/something I don't wanna lose
{131375}{131498}/And never wanna|/be without ever again
{131527}{131661}/You're the best thing|/I never knew I needed

{132374}{132454}/The way you smile|/and how you comfort me
{132455}{132483}/With your laughter
{132484}{132584}/I must admit you were|/not a part of my book
{132585}{132670}/But now if you open|/it up and take a look
{132671}{132817}/You're the beginning|/and the end of every chapter
