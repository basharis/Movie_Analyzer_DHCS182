1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,638
See these? With arcs.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,519
You make the water flow from here
and give out with a hoe...

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,878
...so the water can pass on the others.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,149
He was a little boy,
he was running around. He grew up.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,319
- He was at your age.
- At my age?

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,996
I wish I could see my father
when he was at my age.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,874
How can it be possible?
Those were the old times.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,556
I wish there was a time machine.
We would push its button and...

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,913
...go back to my dad's childhood and
see him, that would be nice, right?

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,478
Sure, that would be nice and we
would seem younger, then, right?

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,357
Don't be so sarcastic.
Do you want to be a young girl, now?

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,112
I am still young, look who is talking!

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,398
You are an old woman,
but you still wear the same clothes...

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,634
...you used to wear 10 years ago
to pretend to be younger.

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,315
You go, we will go to coffee house.
We'll meet you there.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,039
- Let's buy the books Deniz wanted.
- We can buy on the way back home.

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,828
We buy newspaper, too.
We shouldn't forget his books...

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,589
...or he gets mad at me in the evening.
- Children are so likeable, right?

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,036
- Sure, they are.
- I like my kids and yours, too.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,432
I am his uncle,
meaning almost his father, right?

21
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,671
Right, brother.

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,668
Have a nice day, Mustafa.
Look, Sadik is here.

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,795
Welcome Sadik. What brings you here?

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,714
Hello Mustafa.

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,675
I got it now. That's why
he kept telling "the other one".

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,356
Your dad bought some books to your son.

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,154
How should I know? When he said
"books", I couldn't imagine.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,118
- Did my dad buy books?
- Yes, he did. You know, Texas, Tommix.

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,155
So many of them. For his grandson.

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,038
Dad bought books to your son,
did you hear it, Sadik?

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,675
Yeah. All right, then. Let's go.

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,555
Look Mustafa, he sounded like us.

33
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,599
I told you, Sadik doesn't deny
where he came from.

34
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,869
Bon app, tit, Huseyin Agha. I heard
that Sadik is here. I am happy for you.

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,396
- Where did you see them?
- Downtown.

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,956
They said they were
coming to coffee house.

37
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,471
Yes, right. He wants to see you all.
We talked about it in the morning.

38
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,351
Where are you going, Hüseyin? You
haven't finished smoking your water pipe.

39
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,598
I have some work to do.
Your water pipe wasn't good.

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,759
Do you buy cheap tobacco or what?
It feels like smoking straw.

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,596
- What?
- Wait, dad.

42
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,279
I heard that you have bought
some books for Deniz, today. Thank you.

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,955
- The kid wanted.
- That's very kind of you.

44
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,073
All right, get out of my way,
go, do your job.

45
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,037
- I have no job, dad. I quitted my job.
- That's why you came here, then.

46
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,914
Come on, let's go the coffee house.

47
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,273
Birgül.

48
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,908
This is my day of
getting beaten up, I guess.

49
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,157
Why did you say that?

50
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,356
Forget it, come on.

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,954
All right, we are dead.
Go, play some where else. Don't bother us.

52
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,194
That's great. You said
he wouldn't come at that time of the day.

53
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,949
I wish I wouldn't believe you
and stay for a tea.

54
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,515
How should I know, sister? It is so
unusual for him to come at this time.

55
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,593
Why do you get me involved
with this sulking man?

56
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,399
Are you leaving, just because
I am here, you crazy girl?

57
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,109
Tell your husband,
I am here because kids are here.

58
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,159
Otherwise, may the devil be
with "some people".

59
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,436
- All right, I'll tell him.
- Oh, God.

60
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,919
- Like a camel's grudge!
- Look, who is talking.

61
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,159
Look, who is talking.
Are you the most peaceful man on earth?

62
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,916
- Do you want tea, dad?
- No. Stop it. It is so hot.

63
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:25,070
- Where is our new boy?
- He is playing with Hüseyin.

64
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,275
What did you buy?

65
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,154
Some stuff.

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,113
Have you ever entered this room?
There is treasure in there, right?

67
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,511
Grandpa'll get angry.
Stop meddling with it.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,355
What's going on?

69
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,197
If you ever get close to this door...

70
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,553
...I fall out with you, OK?
- You what?

71
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,075
- I mean, I will punish you.
- What is in there?

72
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,876
There are dogs like monsters.
They may eat you.

73
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,793
I got you a present. Look, here.

74
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,519
However, it is not going to be opened
till the evening. You are punished.

75
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,555
You are not going to meddle with this, OK?

76
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,838
- OK.
- Come on, come with me now.

77
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,272
Where are you, big boy? Come out.

78
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,879
Wow, what an appetite!

79
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,991
Sadik seems a bit quiet.
Does he have a problem or what?

80
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,351
I know his problem.
He had quitted his job.

81
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,591
When did you talk about it?

82
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,914
Seeking a friend.

83
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,476
We came across downtown.

84
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,074
The flowers in the courtyard withered,
although I water them regularly.

85
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,752
How should I know?
We get the garden disinfected.

86
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,588
Maybe it affected the flowers, too.
It is weird.

87
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,190
Seeking a friend.

88
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,313
Come over here, grandson.

89
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,757
I hope you'll like them.

90
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,991
Grandpa bought me books.

91
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,958
They can be yours, if you kiss me once.

92
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,879
Come on, let's read together.

93
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,959
You found your friend here, Deniz.
You lost your time for nothing.

94
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,074
The letters are so small.

95
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,392
- Shall I read you out loudly for you?
- Come on, read.

96
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,958
They look great! Well done.

97
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,872
You are a bit quiet.

98
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,235
You are right. A bit.

99
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,669
Is this a case of "urban- rural
confusion" or alienation?

100
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,232
Don't even try to say that, I won't
believe you. This is your hometown.

101
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,955
Hometown? Home? Fatherland?

102
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,318
Lately, I have been revising
the meanings of these words.

103
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,319
I always thought that
I was struggling for this country.

104
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,553
But this country wouldn't even care.

105
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,349
That's what lots of people
think these days.

106
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,073
We used to dream about
leaving here, remember?

107
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,952
You managed, I couldn't.

108
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,190
I want to ask you something.
At least, you tried.

109
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,829
For someone who was afraid to try.
Can you really say that I missed too much?

110
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,875
I am asking, because I am really
curious about it. No other reasons.

111
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,150
If you were given another chance,
after all you've lived through...

112
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,589
...should you stay or leave?
- I don't know.

113
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:47,034
I guess, I would take everything I have
here or bring the ones over here back.

114
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,710
Do you know what the hardest one is?
To be caught in the middle.

115
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,719
- I could neither leave nor stay.
- What are they chatting about?

116
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,590
It's an "intellectual talk",
it doesn't suit us.

117
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,158
Come on, intellectuals, cheers!

118
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,037
Bon appetite.

119
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,555
These are like Turkish Delight.

120
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,750
You are late.
Go to your bed, right away.

121
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,910
Shall I make you coffee?
Did Salim go home?

122
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,148
Mum.

123
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,435
Take Deniz to Salims'.

124
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,790
I shouldn't have let Salim go,
he could take you with him.

125
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,792
What are you talking about?

126
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,396
Mum, please take Deniz and go,
just for tonight.

127
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,038
I am going to talk to dad
and most probably we'll argue.

128
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,032
Dad, I know you heard us, you hear me.

129
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,273
We need to talk.

130
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,671
I didn't come here to apologize,
because there is no reason for that.

131
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,477
I won't go into a discussion like
"forgive each other".

132
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,956
I will be in the courtyard, dad.
Get dressed and come.

133
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,316
This is very important.

134
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,315
We need to talk.

135
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,794
- Something wrong?
- No. Can you help mum?

136
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,993
She is near the tractor.

137
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,910
You wait here.

138
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,868
Uncle Ibrahim, where are we going?

139
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,237
To uncle Salims'.
You will stay there tonight.

140
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,956
- Why? Where is my dad?
- He is there, too.

141
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,639
All of us will stay over there tonight.

142
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,518
Don't be afraid, Deniz. It is OK.
It is just a visit.

143
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,232
It doesn't make sense. Uncle Ibrahim,
I think I am dreaming right now.

144
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,995
Yes, you are dreaming.

145
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,630
Don't afraid, Deniz, don't afraid!

146
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,436
Deniz wasn't afraid of anything.

147
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,911
Nene Hatun and her grandson
passed through the enemy...

148
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,313
...front bravely with corporal Ibrahim.

149
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,950
They were the super heroes
of the Independence War.

150
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,279
Don't be afraid.

151
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,271
- Good evening, dad.
- What evening?

152
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,990
Don't you aware of the time?

153
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,396
- It is almost morning.
- I'm sorry. This is not an appropriate time

154
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,957
The things you do are
always inappropriate.

155
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,389
Dad, let's not argue. We did that
a lot in the past. It never worked.

156
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,030
Nothing changed, as you see.

157
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,950
There are things we need to talk.

158
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,997
Cigarette?

159
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,274
I don't smoke that one, it makes me cough.

160
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,193
Dad, you don't know why I am back.

161
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,113
Actually, there shouldn't have been any
reason, I should have just come back,

162
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,716
But it didn't happen that way.

163
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:38,038
My name is Sadik,
my brother's name is Salim.

164
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,160
So what? My name is Hüseyin.

165
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,396
Why did you give us these names, dad?

166
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,191
Were you that much scared of us,
right from the beginning?

167
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,236
Did you want to manage our lives that
much? When I wanted to find my own way.

168
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,279
That way of yours.

169
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,514
We sent you Istanbul to study
agriculture, not to become an anarchist.

170
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,755
That's what I was just about to say, dad.
You sent me to study agriculture.

171
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,836
No other choice.
Become an engineer, manage the farm...

172
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,959
...to stay here and get married to Birgül.

173
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,356
You chose my school,
my life, my everything, dad.

174
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,832
Do you know that I hate that, dad?

175
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,115
You are calling me selfish, right?

176
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,711
You mentioned Birgül.

177
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,032
After you left, have you ever thought
of that girl, how she suffered?

178
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,433
Her tears didn't stop for years and you
are calling me selfish, give me a break!

179
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,110
Dad, you said "you left", but I didn't.
I couldn't. I couldn't stay though.

180
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,439
I couldn't recognize where my home is.

181
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,596
Somewhere in my mind
you have always tried to lead me.

182
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,638
Our arguments and matters between us.

183
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,394
Do you have any idea what it means to
have no home to come back, dad?

184
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,877
However, everything got even worse.
My wife died.

185
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,277
My revolutionist friends, who used to
call me "petty bourgeois" at the time...

186
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,075
...gave me jobs in advertisement agencies,
capitalist papers, taking pity on me.

187
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,352
Like throwing a bone to a dog.

188
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,153
In order to clear themselves,
in order to clean their souls!

189
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,191
Wait, I am getting out of the subject.

190
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,875
I was talking about "home".

191
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,514
Do you know why I returned, dad?

192
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,995
Give a room to Deniz?

193
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,509
Let him grow up here,
let him have a home.

194
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,160
He has nowhere else to go.

195
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:05,112
Did you get now, what it means
to have a child? It is hard, isn't it?

196
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,749
You aren't able to look after him, right?

197
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,871
- You see what it means to have a child?
- Sure I see.

198
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,231
Do you have any idea about not
to be able to see a child's growing up?

199
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,839
Do you know that feeling?

200
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,311
The life will go on...

201
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,873
Some people will write new books,
you won't be able to read them.

202
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,839
New films will be shot,
you won't be able to see them.

203
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,274
You will want to listen again some song
you like, but you won't able to do it.

204
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,150
Maybe you'll get used to
these things, easily...

205
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,957
While he is growing up, not be beside him.

206
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,433
Not to be able to see his first
girlfriend.

207
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,358
Dad...

208
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,113
...my heart is in flames.

209
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,428
I guess, this is a feeling like leaving
something left undone.

210
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,429
Recently, I've been trying to
push him away when he hugs me.

211
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,276
I have been trying my best to
keep him away from me.

212
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,835
I hate myself for
being a pain in his life.

213
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,398
Give him a room, dad.

214
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,515
Let him have a home,
but he could leave time to time.

215
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,709
There are so many things that
I wanted to tell him. You tell him.

216
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,960
Tell him that.

217
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,393
My son. What happened?

218
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,878
Where are you?

219
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,275
Hold it! I am coming!

220
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,510
- Come over here, sister.
- What happened? Where is Sadik?

221
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,673
- They got him in a room.
- Dad is talking to the doctor.

222
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,951
He said "don't tire him". We'll be able
to see him after a few minutes.

223
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,038
He is getting oxygen.

224
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,750
- What is wrong with him? What did they
say? - We don't know. We'll find out soon.

225
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,914
Come on Salim, don't.
Let's go to the garden.

226
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,274
Stop it, it doesn't necessarily mean
something bad. Don't let yourself go.

227
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,194
- Where are the kids?
- They are at home with Sakine.

228
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,269
We didn't tell them. We said
we were going to downtown, shopping.

229
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,633
He figured that something is wrong,
but didn't ask anything.

230
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,397
Let's go down to the café,
we can't talk here.

231
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,995
I can't wait till there. Say it.

232
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,235
Don't confuse me. The doctor said
so many things, I have to clear my mind.

233
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,433
- I hope he'll get well soon, Hüseyin.
- Thank you.

234
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,672
Sadik took out his health report from
his pocket...

235
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,152
...and gave it to us.

236
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,232
He was carrying in his pocket.

237
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,597
He has spent some time in prison,
you know.

238
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,113
During the military coup,
after Deniz was born.

239
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,469
He became ill there.

240
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,398
The doctor said, because of the torture
and prison conditions.

241
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,160
There is liquid accumulation
in his lungs. An edema.

242
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,317
It got better for a while.
A few years ago it came back.

243
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,475
One of his lungs is already damaged.

244
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,515
The other one He was getting
his treatment there, in Istanbul.

245
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,071
He was getting medicines.

246
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,950
This is the case.

247
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,514
The doctor said
he would do his best, but...

248
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,350
...there is little hope.

249
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,110
He told me to get prepare for the worse.

250
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,759
Salim, pull yourself together.

251
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,190
If you'll be like this near the kid
Pull yourself together, what a shame!

252
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,717
How can I, dad?
My brother is dying, what are you saying?

253
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,316
It's very kind of you to come here, Fatma.

254
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,553
Both the kid and Sadik
have been asking about you.

255
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,996
I intended to come earlier,
but it took too much time to.

256
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,037
Take the kids to the village,
to my sisters'.

257
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,592
- Where were you born, Fatma?
- Kayseri.

258
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,996
Some of my relatives are still there.
But we are very much apart of each other.

259
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,359
Some of us are in Istanbul,
some of us are there.

260
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,189
That's the way it is.

261
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,551
Come on, dad. Take over them!

262
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,599
- Don't intervene.
- You are treading on my toes.

263
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,349
- Don't hit me!
- Stop it! It may be an accident.

264
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,594
That's enough. Stop the car, Salim.
Let's throw the kids out of the car.

265
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,155
Be quiet, kids.

266
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,037
I am going to cry that here is a fire.
I wish I would go with the others.

267
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,637
I am sweating.
Sakine, what a big hip you have.

268
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,909
- Move a side a bit.
- It's the kids, what I can do?

269
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,234
Stop the car, Salim.

270
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,235
Why did you stop? What is it,
is it the car again? Why did you stop?

271
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,114
I don't know.
All of you told me to stop and

272
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,120
Go on, move it. Why did you stop?

273
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,151
Hüseyin, Ay segül, what happened to you?

274
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,793
If they make any noise, I'll call the
doctors to give them an injection.

275
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,594
They are afraid of doctors.

276
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,560
Let's go outside.

277
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,477
Is this room hot for you, son?

278
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,912
No, it is OK. It is cool in the evenings.
It is slept well here.

279
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,317
- The wind blows from here.
- Do you stay here, too?

280
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,951
Sometimes me, sometimes his mother.
We manage it in some way.

281
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,958
- You wanted these from home.
- Thanks.

282
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,318
Please put them into that drawer.

283
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,719
Fatma will stay with us, right?
We won't let her go.

284
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,675
I can't stay long. The schools will be
opened soon, I have some work to do.

285
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,036
There is still time for the schools.

286
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,272
Dad, will I go to school here?

287
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,518
Yes, Deniz. Is it bad?

288
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,799
No, it is even better.
You'll get better until that time, right?

289
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,357
The schools will be opened
a month later, right?

290
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,393
Yes, but you'll get better, right?

291
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,591
Sure, I will.

292
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,232
Your wife was a beautiful woman.
May God bless her soul.

293
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,159
Look at this, Deniz is so small here.

294
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,399
Had you taken this picture with you
to Istanbul?

295
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,796
I was wondering where it was.

296
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,277
When you first came here,
you know we went to the vineyard.

297
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,077
Deniz said "I wish I could see
my father wandering around.

298
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,511
When he was a child,
I wish there was a time machine.

299
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,913
- We would push the button".
- Really? Look at that little rascal!

300
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,512
- Bring me water from downstairs.
- There is water here. Shall I give you?

301
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,716
- I want another one from downstairs.
- It is water, dad. They are all the same.

302
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,836
Brother, bring it from downstairs.

303
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,636
Once you said something to me.
About Deniz.

304
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,192
You told that you had some things
you couldn't say to Deniz.

305
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,311
I have some things
I couldn't say to you, as well.

306
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,874
I am not good at making a speech.

307
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,119
You are my son...

308
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,477
...my everything.

309
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,117
That's all I am saying.

310
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,711
I understood, dad.
I understood very well, thank you.

311
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,759
You said once, "I wish
he didn't see me in bed like this".

312
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,438
Don't worry.

313
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:48,589
Sons remember their dads
just the way they want...

314
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,509
...right, Sadik?

315
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,392
Good morning.

316
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,597
Good morning, uncle Hüseyin.

317
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,599
Is your husband at home?

318
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,872
No, he went to Izmir.
We'll get our garden disinfected.

319
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,397
- He won't return till the evening, right?
- Yes, I guess so.

320
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,232
I have a request.

321
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,309
Open your mouth, come on.

322
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,358
I can eat by myself, brother.
Give me that.

323
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,274
Why would I? You don't eat, then.
You are cheating me.

324
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,114
Look, that fat nurse
is complaining about you.

325
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,311
Open your mouth.

326
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,433
You have a visitor.

327
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,754
I hope you'll get well soon.

328
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,270
Come on, go outside, to the garden.

329
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,998
Not before he finishes his soup.
The fat nurse is very angry.

330
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,638
Do you remember the time
when I was in primary school and...

331
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,191
...you were junior high school?
One day I had made some raisin cookies.

332
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,069
I was taking them to the school.

333
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,472
You had tasted one of them
and liked so much.

334
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,992
- You hadn't even believe that I made it.
- So?

335
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,918
I brought you those cookies. Eat it,
I wonder if you'll remember the taste.

336
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,515
I never forgot.

337
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,034
Didn't you? I didn't, either.

338
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,436
- You don't seem to be changed at all.
- I have changed.

339
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,069
How wouldn't I change?

340
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,677
- You are married with Mehmet, right?
- Yes, sure, I had.

341
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,470
How wouldn't I get married?

342
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,673
We heard about your wife.
We felt very sorry.

343
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,957
Well done.
We appreciated you so much.

344
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,517
You raised your child on your own.
You didn't need anyone.

345
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,951
You have two, right?

346
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,438
Yes, indeed.

347
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,954
It is delicious. Did you make it
right before you came here?

348
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,432
No, I had some at home.
My sons like it.

349
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,791
I wanted to name to
one of the boys after you.

350
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,232
But I was afraid that Mehmet might
realize and get angry with me.

351
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,236
We named him Caner,
but I always call him Sadik in my mind.

352
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,114
I wanted you to know this.

353
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,599
Did you forgive me?

354
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,031
Sure, I did, Sadik.
How wouldn't I forgive you?

355
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,073
The cars are coming. What should we do?

356
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,790
They'll all cry now,
maybe you should take away the kid.

357
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,191
I am sure they will control themselves
while the child is here.

358
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,837
Come on,
let's go to the field all together.

359
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,634
And make you a wooden horse, OK?

360
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,997
If I stood like this...

361
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,318
...right here.

362
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,036
If I opened my arms like this...

363
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,192
If I stopped him.

364
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,752
If I stopped him.

365
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,871
If I told him not to go.

366
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,514
15 years ago...

367
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:22,756
...if I stood like this,
Nuran If I stopped Sadik.

368
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,669
Get your arms down.

369
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,435
For God's sake, pull yourself together.

370
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,872
If I hugged him like this...

371
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,515
...if I told my son not to go.

372
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,710
Don't. You are our father.

373
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:48,872
Look, we have a grandson,
pull yourself together.

374
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,477
He wouldn't leave, then.

375
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,354
He would stay.

376
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,997
I wish I had said nothing.
I wish I had kept my mouth shut.

377
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,069
I brought about his death!

378
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,869
- I couldn't stop him.
- Uncle Hüseyin, please stop it.

379
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,797
Stand right here!

380
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,513
Open your arms!
I said "open your arms".

381
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,511
Sister, are you mad?

382
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,349
Come with me.

383
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,110
Move!

384
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,835
Run towards your dad.
Run. Break through him.

385
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:22,079
If you don't, your dad will never get
well for all his life. Run!

386
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,151
Catch him. Stop him!

387
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,112
Dad.

388
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,160
I am coming, dad! Get out of my way!

389
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,430
You see? No one can stop the one
who wants to leave.

390
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,188
Oh, no! Salim!

391
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,436
It is all right. You ran and
it is over. Come back here!

392
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,753
He is running towards the river.
He may fall in and drown!

393
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,991
Look how his uniform suits him!

394
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,513
- Let me get your collar.
- Don't move!

395
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,828
- You tightened so much.
- But you are going to be so pretty.

396
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,835
Very well, they all look pretty.
Let's put your handkerchiefs...

397
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,039
...into your pockets so that
they don't call you snotty.

398
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,672
These are the presents from your aunt,
Gülbeyaz, for your primary school day.

399
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,550
I mean, for your first school day.

400
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,315
"Primary school day" sounded like
"primary school".

401
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,312
I meant "the first day of school".
What am I saying? You made me confused.

402
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,639
Aunt Gülbeyaz, grandpa gave us money,
but you gave us handkerchiefs.

403
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,752
I am not rich as much as your
grandpa, my child.

404
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,516
Sure, not as much as me.
She was going to say "as much as Croesus".

405
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,432
But she got confused, I guess.

406
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,956
Who is Croesus?

407
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,035
There is a scorpion in your aunt's
pocket. She is afraid to be stung by it.

408
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,111
Don't laugh Nuran. Otherwise
I will never come to your house again.

409
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,957
- I swear, I will never come here again.
- I didn't laugh, sister. You misunderstood

410
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,273
Come on, line up. We'll take photos.
Brahim, you do that.

411
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,035
I wish we tidied ourselves up a little,
we'll seem ugly.

412
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,831
- You are OK, mum, come here.
- Come on, Gülbeyaz.

413
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,395
- You do it, I don't want.
- Come here, girl! Don't act like a child.

414
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,470
Ready!

415
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,710
- Dad, who is Croesus?
- How should I know?

416
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,514
- I guess, he was one of the kings.
- How is the grandson?

417
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,757
He has to get used to it.

418
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,912
We are trying best to
make him feel better.

419
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,198
He has talked only a few words
last 4 weeks, though.

420
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,997
It should be better for him
if he cried, screamed, let it go.

421
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,516
He is like a small bird
fallen down from nest.

422
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,677
We are so afraid to say anything.

423
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,468
They said it's psychological, he has
just closed himself to the world outside.

424
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,071
I don't know for which one
I should be sorry. Him or my son?

425
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,435
Deniz, let's go.

426
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,837
- My son!
- My grandson!

427
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,236
What is it, my dear?

428
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,349
I missed my dad so much.

429
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:32,158
Don't be sorry. Look, we are here,
your siblings are here.

430
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:41,910
Hüseyin, Ay segül, your grand aunt.

431
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,433
We are all here.

432
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,158
You don't have to go to school today.

433
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,754
Teachers wouldn't give homework,
this is the first day of school.

434
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,711
Look, you'll have new friends there,
they'll like you so much.

435
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,637
Look, there are horses here.

436
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,710
We can drive tractor,
I can teach you how to it.

437
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,995
Actually, do you know that
people don't die?

438
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,672
God takes them to his side.

439
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,713
We call them "dead", but...

440
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,232
...they actually wait for us in the sky.

441
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,909
- Right, grandpa?
- Sure.

442
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,518
Then, one day we'll all meet up there.

443
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,873
Your dad'll be there, too.

444
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,113
All of us will be there.

445
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,399
We'll look down from the skies.

446
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,712
You are lying. No one will fly.

447
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,273
Of course, we won't fly with our wings.
I mean some other form.

448
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,151
Why would we lie to you?
Look, he doesn't believe us.

449
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,951
We read a book together, remember?
You call it comics.

450
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,672
The guy was flying, don't you believe
him, either? What was it?

451
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,556
Right. Your dad became Superman.

452
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,868
- He is flying in the skies.
- I want him to come down.

453
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,118
I don't want him to fly.
I want him here.

454
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,195
Come with me, then.
I'll show you your dad.

455
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:53,313
- Grandpa. We entered the secret room.
- Yes, we did. Wait here, it's dark.

456
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,636
Look, Deniz, one of our neighbor
has gone to Germany to work.

457
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,992
His name is Osman.

458
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,714
Look at this.

459
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,074
- A projection machine!
- Right, there is a film in it, actually.

460
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,392
Let's watch it.

461
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:20,999
Your grandpa asked Osman to bring a
projection machine.

462
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,553
Grandpa shot all of us.

463
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,471
Look, like this.

464
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,592
I used to be a director in the past.

465
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,390
Come on, the film is about to start.
Did you get your tickets?

466
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,598
- Do you have any money?
- Yes.

467
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,074
We have and we have a lot,
you just gave us. Two for me.

468
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,673
Don't pay, my child. He is fooling you.

469
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,349
Grandpa the director,
don't get any money from us.

470
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,314
All right, then.
Only for this time it is free.

471
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,832
- I'll get her money, though.
- Forget it, you nuts!

472
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,149
- Didn't you leave?
- No, we didn't.

473
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,074
They wanted to return on the way.

474
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,514
- There is a projection machine!
- Come on, don't stand by the door.

475
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,749
Let's all seat.

476
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,190
That's my dad!

477
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,399
It is a silent movie.

478
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,918
Dad!

479
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,519
Take it, it's yours.
Don't tell anyone, OK?

480
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,555
You can shoot movies with this.

481
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,235
- Dad.
- My son!

482
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,115
Did you come out of this?

483
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,559
- Are you going to school?
- Yes, did you see me?

484
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,037
- Grandma says that you can see us.
- Yes.

485
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,274
Your uniform suits you so much.
You were very handsome as usual.

486
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,592
- Were you here?
- Yes.

487
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,078
Dad, am I dreaming again?

488
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,309
I don't know, but even if you are,
it is nice, right?

489
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,917
Why aren't you Superman, then?

490
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,555
Because you have grown up.

491
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,189
When a person grows up,
do his dreams get smaller?

492
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,431
I won't be able to see you again, right?

493
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,238
You can see me, if you want.

494
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,394
Yes, maybe none of them
will be that real like it is now.

495
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,158
Because you'll know that
you create them in your mind.

496
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,911
Yet maybe they'll be even nicer, then.
You can direct them as you like.

497
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,754
You can try to make them real.

498
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:05,029
- This means growing up, right?
- Yes, handsome. This means growing up.

499
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,438
- I wish I'd never grow up.
- Why is that?

500
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,432
- I won't able to see you again, then.
- You'll grow up, you have to grow up.

501
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,879
When you grow up, you won't need
to see me, you won't need me.

502
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,596
Come on, get into the house.
It's going to rain.

503
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,518
Will you get wet?

504
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:36,149
No, I won't and I'll always be happy,
because you have a home, handsome.

505
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,757
Are you leaving?

506
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,477
Look, let's play a game with you.
Get the camera and shoot me walking.

507
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,759
There is no film in it.

508
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:04,069
Yes, there is. I put it.
Come on, shoot me.

509
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,590
Bye dad.

510
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,309
Deniz made a promise to his dad
while he was saying goodbye to him.

511
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,797
He would grow up and never cry.

512
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:56,069
Because he had a superhero dad
even if he doesn't fly in the skies.

513
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:02,151
Deniz let the superhero leave, because
new adventures were waiting for him.

514
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,712
These happy ending stories
should be told to others.
