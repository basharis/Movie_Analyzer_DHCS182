1
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:32,500
The mathematicians won the war.

2
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,595
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes

3
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,805
and built the A-bomb.

4
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,017
Mathematicians, like you.

5
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:46,939
The stated goal of the Soviets
is global Communism.

6
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:51,110
In medicine or economics,
in technology or space

7
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,820
battle lines
are being drawn.

8
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,824
To triumph,
we need results,

9
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,327
publishable,
applicable results.

10
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,039
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?

11
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,708
The next Einstein?

12
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,670
Who among you will be
the vanguard of democracy,

13
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,380
freedom, and discovery?

14
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:16,552
Today, we bequeath America's
future into your able hands.

15
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,765
Welcome to Princeton,
gentlemen.

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,409
It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

17
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,537
No, he has to
have it all for himself.

18
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,791
It's the first time the Carnegie Prize
has been split. Hansen's all bent.

19
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,126
He's got his
sights set on Wheeler Lab,

20
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,087
the new military
think-tank at MIT.

21
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,881
They're only
taking one this year.

22
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,967
Hansen's used to
being picked first.

23
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,718
Yeah,
he's wasted on math.

24
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,054
He should be running
for president.

25
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,859
There could be a mathematical
explanation for how bad your tie is.

26
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,658
Thank you.

27
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,995
Neilson,
symbol cryptography.

28
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,956
Neils here broke a Jap code.
Helped rid the world of Fascism.

29
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,792
At least that's what he
tells the girls, eh, Neils?

30
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,295
The name's Bender.
Atomic physics.

31
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,838
And you are?
Am I late?

32
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,506
Yes, Mr. Sol.

33
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,258
Good. Hi.

34
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,552
Sol. Richard Sol.

35
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,220
Ah,
the burden of genius.

36
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,263
There he is.

37
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,389
So many supplicants,
and so little time.

38
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,224
Mr. Sol.
How are you, sir?

39
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,684
Bender.
Nice to see you.

40
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,894
Congratulations,
Mr. Hansen.

41
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,103
Thank you.

42
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,480
I'll take another.

43
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,233
Excuse me?

44
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,319
A thousand pardons. I simply
assumed you were the waiter.

45
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,403
Play nice, Hansen.

46
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,030
Nice is not
Hansen's strong suit.

47
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,281
An honest mistake.

48
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,158
Well, Martin Hansen.

49
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,911
It is Martin, isn't it?

50
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,622
Why, yes, John, it is.

51
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,082
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

52
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:17,840
I've read your preprints,
both of them.

53
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,970
The one on Nazi ciphers and the
other one on nonlinear equations.

54
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,474
And I am supremely confident
that there is not a single seminal

55
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,225
or innovative idea
in either one of them.

56
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,522
Enjoy your punch.

57
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:42,490
Gentlemen, meet John Nash, the
mysterious West Virginia genius.

58
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,910
The other winner of the
distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.

59
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,328
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, yeah?

60
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,829
Of course.

61
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,238
Oh, Christ.

62
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,992
The prodigal roommate arrives.

63
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,786
Roommate?

64
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,079
Oh, God, no.

65
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,002
Did you know that
having a hangover

66
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,462
is not having enough
water in your body

67
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,132
to run your Krebs cycle?

68
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,468
Which is exactly what happens to
you when you're dying of thirst.

69
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,888
So, dying of thirst

70
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,851
would probably feel

71
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:56,439
pretty much like the hangover
that finally bloody kills you.

72
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,817
John Nash?

73
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,068
Hello.

74
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,030
Charles Herman.
Pleased to meet you.

75
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,459
All right! Well done!

76
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,800
Well, it's official.
I'm almost human again.

77
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,180
Officer, I saw the driver who hit
me. His name was Johnnie Walker.

78
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,396
Well, I got in
last night in time

79
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,607
for English
department cocktails.

80
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:41,776
Cock was mine,

81
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,612
the tail belonged to a particularly
lovely young thing with a passion

82
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,201
for D. H. Lawrence. You're
not easily distracted, are you?

83
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,535
I'm here to work.

84
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,788
Are you? Right.
I see. Crikey!

85
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,509
Is my roommate a dick?

86
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,637
Hmm?

87
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,766
Listen. If we can't
break the ice,

88
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,644
how about we drown it?

89
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,906
So what's your story?

90
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,035
You the poor kid that never
got to go to Exeter or Andover?

91
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,248
Despite my privileged upbringing,
I'm actually quite well-balanced.

92
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,833
I have a chip on
both shoulders.

93
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,588
Maybe you're just better with the
old integers than you are with people.

94
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,465
My first grade teacher,
she told me

95
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,342
that I was born with
two helpings of brain

96
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,261
but only half
a helping of heart.

97
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,056
Wow!
She sounds lovely!

98
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,602
The truth is that
I don't like people much.

99
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,730
And they don't
much like me.

100
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,358
But why, with all your
obvious wit and charm?

101
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,737
Seriously, John.

102
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,032
Mathematics.

103
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,370
Mathematics is never going
to lead you to a higher truth.

104
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,080
And you know why?

105
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,208
Because it's boring.
It's really boring.

106
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,628
You know, half these schoolboys
are already published?

107
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,217
I cannot waste time with
these classes and these books.

108
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,182
Memorizing the weak
assumptions of lesser mortals!

109
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,439
I need to look through
to the governing dynamics.

110
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,445
Find a truly original idea.

111
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,364
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.

112
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,116
It's the only way that
I'll ever... Matter.

113
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,288
Yes.

114
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,625
All right,
who's next?

115
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,293
I've played enough Go
for one day.

116
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,295
Come on.
I hate this game.

117
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,047
Cowards, all of you!

118
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,216
None of you rise to
meet my challenge?

119
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,886
Come on, Bender. Whoever wins,
Sol does his laundry all semester.

120
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,430
Does that seem unfair to
anyone else? Not at all.

121
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,184
Look at him.

122
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,435
Nash!

123
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,978
Taking a reverse
constitutional?

124
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,814
I'm hoping to extract an
algorithm to define their movement.

125
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:30,986
Oh.

126
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,404
Psycho.

127
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,157
Nash, I thought
you dropped out.

128
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,450
You ever going to
go to class or...

129
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,328
Classes will
dull your mind.

130
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,331
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

131
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,625
Oh, I didn't know that.

132
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,169
Nash is going to stun
us all with his genius.

133
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,714
Which is another way of saying he
doesn't have the nerve to compete.

134
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,260
You scared?

135
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,720
Terrified.
Mortified. Petrified.

136
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,846
Stupefied by you.

137
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,600
No starch.

138
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,018
Pressed and folded.

139
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,565
Let me ask you
something, John.

140
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,359
Be my guest, Martin.

141
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,860
Bender and Sol here
correctly completed

142
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,280
Allen's proof of
Perron's conjecture.

143
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:18,200
Adequate work
without innovation.

144
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,994
Oh, I'm flattered.
You flattered?

145
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,453
Flattered.

146
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,205
And I've got
two weapons briefs

147
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,624
under security review
by the DoD.

148
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,376
Derivative drivel.

149
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,880
But Nash achievements,
zero.

150
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,342
I'm a patient man, Martin. Is
there an actual question coming?

151
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,389
What if you never come up
with your original idea, huh?

152
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:46,395
How will it feel when I'm chosen
for Wheeler and you're not?

153
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,234
What if you lose?

154
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,580
You should not have won.

155
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,834
I had the first move,
my play was perfect.

156
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,544
The hubris of the defeated.

157
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,920
The game is flawed.

158
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,089
Oh!

159
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,513
Gentlemen,
the great John Nash.

160
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,564
You've been
in here for two days.

161
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,569
You know Hansen has just
published another paper?

162
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,238
I can't even find
a topic for my doctorate.

163
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,494
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

164
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,664
This is a group
playing touch football.

165
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,668
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over breadcrumbs.

166
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,716
And this here is a woman who is
chasing a man who stole her purse.

167
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,970
John, you watched a mugging.
That's weird.

168
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,474
In competitive behavior,
someone always loses.

169
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,894
Well, my niece knows that,
John, and she's about this high.

170
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,730
See, if I could
derive an equilibrium

171
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:16,860
where prevalence is a non-singular
event, where nobody loses.

172
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,948
Can you imagine the effect that that
would have on conflict scenarios...

173
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:24,451
When did you last eat?

174
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,577
Currency exchange?

175
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,162
You know, food.

176
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,625
You have no respect for
cognitive reverie, you know that?

177
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,044
Yes. But pizza...

178
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,465
Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.

179
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,593
And, of course, beer.

180
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,351
I have respect for beer.

181
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,397
I have respect for beer!

182
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,907
Good evening, Neils. Ladies. Hey, Nash.

183
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,826
Who's winning? You or you?

184
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,786
Good evening, Nash.

185
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,329
Hey, guys. Hey, Nash.

186
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,000
He's looking
at you for sure.

187
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,668
Me?

188
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,752
Nash.

189
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,300
Hey, Nash. Neils is trying
to get your attention.

190
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,635
- You're joking.
- Oh, no.

191
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,560
Go with God.
Come back a man.

192
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,563
Fortune favors the brave.

193
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,898
Bombs away.

194
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,653
Gentlemen, might I remind
you that my odds of success

195
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,739
dramatically improve
with each attempt?

196
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,167
This is going
to be classic.

197
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,449
Maybe you want to
buy me a drink.

198
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,165
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say

199
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,834
in order for you to
have intercourse with me,

200
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,003
but could we assume
that I've said all that?

201
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,882
Essentially, we're talking
about fluid exchange, right?

202
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,968
So, could we just go
straight to the sex?

203
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,179
That was sweet.

204
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,641
Have a nice night, asshole!

205
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,476
Ladies, wait!

206
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:02,317
I especially liked the bit about
fluid exchange. It was really charming.

207
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,492
Walk with me, John. I've
been meaning to talk with you.

208
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,581
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

209
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,083
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.

210
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,085
Wheeler, sir. That
would be my first choice.

211
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,753
And, actually, I don't really
have a second choice, sir.

212
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,923
John, your fellows
have attended classes.

213
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,009
They've written papers.
They've published.

214
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,470
Oh, I'm still searching, sir,
for my... Your original idea.

215
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,930
Governing dynamics, sir.

216
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,473
It's very clever,
John, but I'm afraid

217
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,017
it's just not
nearly good enough.

218
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,650
May I?
Thank you.

219
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,320
I've been working on
manifold embedding.

220
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,572
My bargaining stratagems are
starting to show some promise.

221
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,282
If you could just
arrange another meeting,

222
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,367
if you would be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein.

223
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,952
I've repeatedly asked you
for that, sir. Now, John...

224
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,455
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...

225
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,623
John.

226
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,710
Do you see what
they're doing in there?

227
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,549
Congratulations, Professor.

228
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,676
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

229
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,055
It's the pens.

230
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,725
Reserved for a member of the department
that makes the achievement of a lifetime.

231
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,394
Now what do you see, John?

232
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,064
Recognition.

233
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,108
Well done, Professor.
Well done.

234
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,902
Well,
try seeing accomplishment.

235
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,321
Is there a difference?

236
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,574
John, you haven't focused.

237
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,704
I'm sorry,
but up to this point,

238
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,165
your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

239
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,253
Good day.

240
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,141
And my compliments
to you, sir.

241
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,351
Thank you so much.

242
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,620
I can't see it.

243
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,505
Jesus Christ, John.

244
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,716
I can't fail.

245
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,008
This is all I am.

246
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,552
Come on, let's go out.

247
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,970
I have to get
something done.

248
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,347
I can't keep
staring into space.

249
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,598
John, that's enough!

250
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,308
Got to face the wall,
follow their rules,

251
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,643
read their books,
do their classes.

252
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,396
You wanna do some damage, that's
fine, but don't mess around.

253
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,150
Come on! Go on, bust
your head! Kill yourself.

254
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,194
John, do it.
Don't mess around.

255
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,073
Bust your head! Go on, bust
that worthless head wide open.

256
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,160
Goddamn it, Charles! What
the hell is your problem?

257
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,748
It's not my problem.

258
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,668
And it's not your problem.

259
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,423
It's their problem.

260
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,968
Your answer isn't,
"Face the wall."

261
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,930
It's out there,
where you've been working.

262
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,704
That was heavy.

263
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,502
That Isaac Newton
fellow was right.

264
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,171
He was onto something.
Clever boy.

265
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,466
Don't worry, that's mine. I'll
come and get it in a minute.

266
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,635
Oh, God!

267
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,766
Incoming, gentlemen.

268
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,564
Deep breaths.

269
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:14,319
Nash, you might want to stop
shuffling your papers for five seconds.

270
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,492
I will not buy
you gentlemen beer.

271
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,410
We're not here
for beer, my friend.

272
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,039
Oh.

273
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,168
Does anyone else feel she
should be moving in slow motion?

274
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,338
Will she want a large
wedding, you think?

275
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,841
Shall we say swords?
Pistols at dawn?

276
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,343
Have you remembered nothing?

277
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,262
Recall
the lessons of Adam Smith,

278
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,222
the father of
modern economics.

279
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,852
"In competition, individual
ambition serves the common good."

280
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,019
Exactly!

281
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,312
Every man for himself,
gentlemen.

282
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,274
Those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

283
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,817
I'm not
going to strike out.

284
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,444
You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

285
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,572
All right, nobody move.

286
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,157
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

287
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,160
Oh, God. All right, he may
have the upper hand now,

288
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,537
but wait until he
opens his mouth.

289
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,706
Remember the last time?

290
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,834
Oh, yes. That was one
for the history books.

291
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,341
Adam Smith needs revision.

292
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,010
What are you
talking about?

293
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,054
If we all go
for the blonde,

294
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,519
we block each other.

295
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,148
Not a single one of us
is going to get her.

296
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,442
So then we go
for her friends,

297
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,237
but they will all
give us the cold shoulder

298
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,197
because nobody likes
to be second choice.

299
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:45,076
Well, what if no one
goes for the blonde?

300
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,955
We don't get in
each other's way

301
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,166
and we don't insult
the other girls.

302
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,502
That's the only way we win.

303
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,673
That's the only way
we all get laid.

304
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,516
Adam Smith said,
"The best result comes

305
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,561
"from everyone in the group
doing what's best for himself."

306
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,690
Right? That's what he said. That's
right. Incomplete. Incomplete, okay?

307
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:21,363
Because the best result will
come from everyone in the group

308
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,784
doing what's best for
himself and the group.

309
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,494
Nash, if this is
some way for you to get

310
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,454
the blonde on your own,
you can go to hell.

311
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,957
Governing dynamics, gentlemen.
Governing dynamics.

312
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,793
Adam Smith was wrong.

313
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,046
Here we go.
Careful, careful.

314
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,801
Thank you.

315
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,649
"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T."

316
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,921
You do realize
this flies in the face

317
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,965
of 150 years of
economic theory?

318
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,216
Yes, I do, sir.

319
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,676
That's rather presumptuous,
don't you think?

320
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:07,886
It is, sir.

321
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,773
Well, Mr. Nash, with a
breakthrough of this magnitude,

322
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,485
I'm confident you will get
any placement you like.

323
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:35,830
Wheeler Labs, they'll ask you
to recommend two team members.

324
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,003
Stills and Frank
are excellent choices.

325
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,838
Sol and Bender, sir.

326
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,175
Sol and Bender are
extraordinary mathematicians.

327
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,135
Has it occurred to you,
Mr. Nash,

328
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,096
that Sol and Bender might
have plans of their own?

329
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,019
We made it!

330
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,063
Wheeler, we made it!

331
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,524
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

332
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,025
Oh ! Oh!

333
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,112
Okay,
awkward moment, gentlemen.

334
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,596
Governing dynamics.

335
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,184
Congratulations, John.

336
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:39,727
Toast!
To Wheeler Labs!

337
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,271
To Wheeler!

338
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,965
General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

339
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,758
Dr. Nash, your coat?

340
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,385
Thank you, sir.

341
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,053
Doctor.

342
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,431
General, this is Wheeler
team leader, Dr. John Nash.

343
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,808
Glad you could come, Doctor.

344
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:19,893
Hello.

345
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,519
Right this way.

346
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,690
We've been intercepting radio
transmissions from Moscow.

347
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,944
The computer can't detect a
pattern, but I'm sure it's code.

348
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,405
Why is that, General?

349
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,241
Ever just know
something, Dr. Nash?

350
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,412
Constantly.

351
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,000
We've developed
several ciphers.

352
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,213
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data?

353
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,507
Doctor?

354
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:55,595
6-7-3-7. 0-3-6...

355
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,263
8-4-9-4.

356
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,474
9-1-4-0-3-4.

357
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:42,725
0-3-4.

358
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,786
I need a map.

359
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:08,543
46-13-08, 67-46-90.

360
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,505
Starkey Corners, Maine.

361
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:18,720
48-03-01. 91-26-35.

362
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,973
Prairie Portage, Minnesota.

363
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,142
These are latitudes
and longitudes.

364
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,311
There are at least
10 others.

365
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,314
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the US.

366
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,608
Extraordinary.

367
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,321
Gentlemen,
we need to move on this.

368
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,241
Who's Big Brother?

369
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,744
You've done your country
a great service, son.

370
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,038
Captain!
Yes, sir.

371
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,333
Accompany Dr. Nash.

372
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,209
What are the Russians
moving, General?

373
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,381
Captain Rogers will escort you
to the unrestricted area, Doctor.

374
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,799
Thank you.

375
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,968
Dr. Nash,
follow me, please.

376
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,729
None of those who have said
they don't like the method

377
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,191
have told us any other method they
could use that would be effective.

378
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,444
- It's Dr. Nash.
- All right.

379
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,669
Thank you, sir. Home
run at the Pentagon, huh?

380
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,631
Have they actually taken the word
"classified" out of the dictionary?

381
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:40,093
Hi. The air conditioning
broke again.

382
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,720
How am I supposed to be in here
saving the world if I'm melting?

383
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,597
Our hearts go
out to you, John.

384
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,393
You know, two trips to
the Pentagon in four years.

385
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,727
That's two more
than we've had.

386
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,104
It gets better, John.

387
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,147
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

388
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,900
You know, the Russians
have the H-bomb,

389
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,486
the Nazis are
repatriating South America,

390
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,988
the Chinese have a standing
army of 2.8 million,

391
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,450
and I am doing
stress tests on a dam.

392
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,620
Look, you made the cover
of Fortune again.

393
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,831
Please note the use of
the word "you," not "we."

394
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,042
That was supposed
to be just me.

395
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,756
Not only do they rob me
of the Fields Medal,

396
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:22,135
now they put me on the cover of
Fortune magazine with these hacks,

397
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,594
these scholars of trivia.

398
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,346
John, exactly what
is the difference

399
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,056
between genius
and most genius?

400
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,059
Quite a lot.

401
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,811
He's your son.

402
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,187
Anyway,
you've got 10 minutes.

403
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,565
I've always got 10 minutes.

404
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,858
Before your new class?

405
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,408
Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?

406
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,036
You are a doctor, John,
and no.

407
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,623
Come on. You know the drill, we
get these beautiful facilities...

408
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,625
MIT gets America's
great minds of today

409
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,419
teaching America's
great minds of tomorrow.

410
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,920
Poor bastards.

411
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,922
Now, have a nice day
at school.

412
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,215
The bell is ringing.

413
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,865
The eager young minds
of tomorrow.

414
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,836
Can we leave one open,
Professor? It's really hot, sir.

415
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:45,593
Your comfort comes second to
my ability to hear my own voice.

416
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,937
Personally, I think this
class will be a waste of your,

417
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,606
and what is
infinitely worse,

418
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,609
my time.

419
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,322
However, here we are.

420
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,408
So, you may attend or not.

421
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,286
You may complete your
assignments at your whim.

422
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,288
We have begun.

423
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,334
Miss.

424
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,880
Excuse me!

425
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,758
Excuse me!
Hey, hey!

426
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,301
Hi!

427
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,013
We have a little problem.

428
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,599
It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed

429
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,394
and extremely noisy
with them open.

430
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,771
So I was wondering if
there was any way you could,

431
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,483
I don't know, maybe work someplace
else for about 45 minutes?

432
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:43,693
Not a problem.

433
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,444
Thank you so much!

434
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,113
- Break!
- Got it!

435
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:50,241
Let's go.
Clean it up a little bit.

436
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,288
As you will find in multivariable
calculus, there is often

437
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,083
a number of solutions
for any given problem.

438
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,214
As I was saying,
this problem here

439
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,884
will take some of you
many months to solve.

440
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,762
For others among you,

441
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,808
it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

442
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,074
Professor Nash.

443
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,505
William Parcher.

444
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,382
Big Brother,

445
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,886
at your service.

446
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:55,181
What can I do for the
Department of Defense?

447
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,557
Are you here to
give me a raise?

448
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,351
Let's take a walk.

449
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,228
Impressive work
at the Pentagon.

450
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:02,855
Yes, it was.

451
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,692
Oppenheimer used to say, "Genius
sees the answer before the question."

452
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,694
You knew Oppenheimer?

453
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,656
His project was
under my supervision.

454
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,240
Which project?

455
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,328
That project.

456
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,913
It's not that simple,
you know?

457
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,623
Well, you ended the war.

458
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,251
We incinerated 150,000
people in a heartbeat.

459
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,213
Great deeds come at
great cost, Mr. Parcher.

460
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,800
Conviction, it turns out,

461
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:34,345
is a luxury of those
on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

462
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,224
I'll try and
keep that in mind.

463
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,270
So, John, no family,

464
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,107
no close friends.

465
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,441
Why is that?

466
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,111
I like to think it's
because I'm a lone wolf.

467
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,115
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

468
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,701
Well, there are
certain endeavors

469
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,202
where your lack of
personal connection

470
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,538
would be considered
an advantage.

471
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,250
This is a secure area.

472
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,168
They know me.

473
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,256
Have you ever been here?

474
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,966
We were told during
our initial briefing

475
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,051
that these warehouses
were abandoned.

476
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,345
That's not
precisely accurate.

477
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,259
By telling you what
I'm about to tell you,

478
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,929
I am increasing your security
clearance to top secret.

479
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:03,058
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

480
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,185
Get it?

481
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,312
What operation?

482
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,986
Those are a good idea.

483
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:21,368
This factory is in Berlin. We
seized it at the end of the war.

484
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:25,790
Nazi engineers were attempting
to build a portable atomic bomb.

485
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,042
The Soviets reached this
facility before we did,

486
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,460
and we lost the damn thing.

487
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,715
The routing orders
at the Pentagon.

488
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,926
They were about this,
weren't they?

489
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,888
The Soviets aren't as
unified as people believe.

490
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,558
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svoboda,

491
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,685
the "New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb

492
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,688
and intends to
detonate it on U.S. soil.

493
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:53,067
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

494
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,909
Man is capable of as much
atrocity as he has imagination.

495
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,081
New Freedom has sleeper
agents here in the U.S.

496
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,419
McCarthy is an idiot, but, unfortunately,
that doesn't make him wrong.

497
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,257
New Freedom
communicates to its agents

498
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,426
through codes imbedded in
newspapers and magazines,

499
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,594
and that's where
you come in.

500
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,807
You see, John,
what distinguishes you

501
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,352
is that you are,
quite simply,

502
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,690
the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.

503
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,490
What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?

504
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,415
Commit this list of
periodicals to memory.

505
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:55,671
Scan each new issue, find any
hidden codes, decipher them.

506
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,384
Place your chin
on the chin rest.

507
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,844
Stare into the light.

508
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,929
Pulse 88, regular.

509
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,310
Okay, this may be
a little uncomfortable.

510
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,940
It's got a little zap
to it, doesn't it?

511
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,860
He just implanted
a radium diode.

512
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,612
Don't worry, it's safe.

513
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,573
The isotope
decays predictably.

514
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,576
As a result, these
numbers change over time.

515
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,121
They're the access codes
to your drop spot.

516
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,834
So what am I now, a spy?

517
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:47,973
Come.

518
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,688
Boy, you must be
really important.

519
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,823
It's all right, Mike.

520
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,542
What are you working on?

521
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,546
Classified.

522
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,549
Everyone waited
half an hour.

523
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,051
For?

524
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,387
Class.

525
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,847
You missed class today.

526
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,684
Well, I suspect that

527
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,562
nobody missed me.

528
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,565
The problem that you
left on the board...

529
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,360
I solved it.

530
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,071
No, you didn't.

531
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,531
You didn't even look.

532
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,618
I never said that the vector
fields were rational functions.

533
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,208
Your solution is elegant.

534
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,296
Though on this
particular occasion

535
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,174
ultimately incorrect.

536
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,114
You're still here.

537
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,949
I'm still here.

538
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,410
Why?

539
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:35,372
I'm wondering,
Professor Nash,

540
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,625
if I can ask you
to dinner.

541
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,840
You do eat, don't you?

542
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,967
On occasion, yeah.

543
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,095
Table for one. Prometheus
alone, chained to the rock

544
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,473
with the bird circling
overhead, you know how it is.

545
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,145
No, I expect that
you wouldn't know.

546
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,401
Leave your address
with my office.

547
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:09,364
I'll pick you up Friday
at 8:00 and we'll eat.

548
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,084
One more thing.
Do you have a name,

549
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,211
or should I just
keep calling you "miss"?

550
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,382
Governor,
may I present...

551
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,510
Miss Alicia Larde.
Miss Alicia Larde.

552
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,180
Professor, please.
You and the governor.

553
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,059
Wait, one second.
I'm sorry.

554
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:42,523
I want a copy of this. First
big date and all, you know.

555
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,609
So, you boys
need to look good,

556
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:51,532
which is not a state you find
yourselves in altogether naturally.

557
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,371
There. Better.

558
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,957
I'm surprising him.

559
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,960
You just keep on
surprising him. Professor.

560
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,729
God must be a painter.

561
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,066
Why else would we
have so many colors?

562
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,404
So you're a painter?

563
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,991
That's not actually
what I said,

564
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:38,370
but, yes, I am.

565
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:48,922
Here.

566
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,926
Me. Your date.

567
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:58,140
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

568
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,726
That's a plan.

569
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,647
Champagne would be lovely.

570
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,443
I'll be outside.

571
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,029
I will get the champagne.

572
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,122
Oh, thank you.

573
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,000
Thank you for that.

574
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,169
No, keep it.

575
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,005
I believe in deciding
things will be good luck.

576
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,174
Do you?

577
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:33,967
No.

578
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,637
I don't believe in luck.

579
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,560
But I do believe in
assigning value to things.

580
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:45,979
Oh.

581
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,573
I once tried to
count them all.

582
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:01,954
I actually made it
to 4,348.

583
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,832
You are exceptionally odd.

584
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,336
I bet you're very
popular with the girls.

585
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,219
A pair of odd ducks, then.

586
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:19,471
Mmm.

587
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,351
Pick a shape.

588
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,521
What?

589
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:31,358
Pick a shape,
an animal, anything.

590
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,987
Okay.

591
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,614
An umbrella.

592
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:19,239
Do it again.

593
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,283
All right.
What would you like?

594
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,285
Do an octopus.

595
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,500
You don't talk much,
do you?

596
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:19,419
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

597
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,838
I don't mean work.

598
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,637
I find that
polishing my interactions

599
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:32,432
in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.

600
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:37,062
I have a tendency to
expedite information flow

601
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,565
by being direct.

602
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,402
I often don't get
a pleasant result.

603
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,820
Try me.

604
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:48,698
All right.

605
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,163
I find you attractive.

606
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,832
Your aggressive
moves towards me

607
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,960
indicate that you
feel the same way.

608
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,171
But still,
ritual requires that

609
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:05,465
we continue with a number
of platonic activities

610
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:08,009
before we have sex.

611
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,388
I am proceeding
with those activities,

612
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,473
but in point of
actual fact,

613
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:18,103
all I really want to do is have
intercourse with you as soon as possible.

614
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,107
Are you going to
slap me now?

615
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,508
How was that result?

616
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,527
What are you doing?

617
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,034
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned reoccurrences

618
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:17,329
within periodicals
over time. And you?

619
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,581
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

620
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,837
Do I know you?

621
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,173
My uncle says
you're very smart

622
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:29,716
but not very nice,

623
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,135
so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

624
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,095
And who might
your uncle be?

625
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,513
The prodigal roommate

626
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,475
returns.

627
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,648
Come here!
Charles, Charles.

628
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:54,074
My sister got herself
killed in a car crash.

629
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,327
Not too far now, Marcee!

630
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,246
Her cowboy husband
was too drunk

631
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:02,624
to know that he was
too drunk to drive.

632
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,751
So, I took her in.

633
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,587
She's so small.

634
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,674
Well, she's young, John.
That's how they come.

635
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:17,097
I'm at Harvard doing the
great author's workshop.

636
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,973
D. H. bloody Lawrence.

637
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,184
I really do think you should
buy yourself a new book.

638
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,981
Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.

639
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,693
How are you, John?

640
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:32,487
At first, all my work
here was trivial,

641
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,281
but a new assignment
came up and...

642
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,702
I can't really
tell you any details.

643
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,496
Top secret?
Black bag? Black ops?

644
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,331
Something like that.

645
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:44,999
And...

646
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,459
Yes?

647
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,295
Well, I met a girl.

648
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,715
No! A human girl?
Homo sapien.

649
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:54,175
A biped? Yep. And contrary
to all probabilities,

650
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,887
she finds me attractive on
a number of different levels.

651
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,973
God, that's wonderful.

652
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,560
Well, there's no accounting
for taste, is there?

653
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:07,939
Should I marry her?

654
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,399
God. Right.

655
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:12,819
I mean,
everything's going well.

656
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,196
The job is fine.
I have enough money.

657
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,157
It all seems to add up.

658
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,076
But how do you know
for sure?

659
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,622
Nothing's ever
for sure, John.

660
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,625
That's the only
sure thing I do know.

661
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,342
Good evening.

662
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:46,853
Alicia, please don't be angry. I
just lost track of time at work,

663
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:49,731
again.
Mmm-hmm.

664
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,859
I'm sorry.

665
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,653
I didn't have time
to wrap it.

666
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,198
Happy birthday.

667
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,496
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

668
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,414
they create a full
wavelength dispersal,

669
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:07,957
so if you look inside it,
you can see...

670
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,083
Every
possible color.

671
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:12,629
Every possible color.
Yeah.

672
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:16,633
Remember you said that time, "God must
be a painter because of all the colors"?

673
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,927
At the governor's house,
you said that.

674
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,222
I didn't think
you were listening.

675
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,726
I was listening.

676
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,068
It's beautiful.

677
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,379
Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?

678
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:56,214
Because I need
some kind of proof,

679
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:59,092
some kind of verifiable,
empirical data.

680
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,350
I'm sorry,
just give me a moment

681
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:12,105
to redefine my
girlish notions of romance.

682
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:16,943
A proof?

683
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,237
Verifiable data.

684
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,031
Okay.

685
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:27,203
Well, how big
is the universe?

686
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,122
Infinite.

687
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:30,915
How do you know?

688
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,500
I know because all the data
indicates it's infinite.

689
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:33,877
But it hasn't been proven yet? No.

690
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:34,961
You haven't seen it.
No.

691
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,212
How do you know for sure?

692
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,132
I don't,
I just believe it.

693
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,425
Mmm.

694
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,637
It's the same with love,
I guess.

695
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:56,065
Now, the part that
you don't know

696
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,945
is if I want to
marry you.

697
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,760
Smile for the camera!

698
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:28,890
Well done!

699
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,518
Congratulations.

700
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,564
You look beautiful.

701
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,108
Hi,
how are you?

702
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,951
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, now.

703
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,453
- Bye!
- Bye!

704
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,913
Be safe!

705
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,819
Get in. Hurry.

706
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,533
They're following us.

707
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,414
Who is...
Who is following us?

708
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,082
The drop has been
compromised.

709
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,251
Get down!

710
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,294
Stay down.

711
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:09,741
Here, take this.

712
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:10,908
I ain't shooting anybody.

713
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,410
Take the goddamn gun!

714
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,953
No!

715
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:34,182
You stay back.
Don't move.

716
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:22,688
John?

717
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,155
Hi.

718
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,368
Where were you?

719
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,374
Sol...
Yeah, I talked to Sol.

720
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,085
He said you left
the office hours ago.

721
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,923
Why didn't you call me?

722
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,096
Are you all right?

723
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,107
Honey?

724
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,068
John.

725
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,405
Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

726
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,616
John, open the door.

727
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:20,079
Come on, open the door!
Let me in!

728
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,998
Talk to me!

729
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,917
John!

730
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,545
Open this door!

731
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,731
Watch for cars, kids.

732
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,378
What was that?

733
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,274
John.

734
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:32,860
William.

735
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:36,197
This is not what
I signed up for.

736
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,032
Every time a car backfires
or a door slams...

737
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:41,869
I understand better than
you could possibly imagine.

738
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:53,839
You need to
calm down, John.

739
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,093
Now listen to me. We're
closing in on the bomb,

740
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:59,262
in large part
due to your work.

741
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:02,014
Now don't you think your
fear is a small price to pay?

742
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:05,309
William,
my circumstance has changed.

743
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,353
Alicia's pregnant.

744
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,572
I told you
attachments were dangerous.

745
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,200
You chose to
marry the girl.

746
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,161
I did nothing
to prevent it.

747
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,792
The best way to
ensure everybody's safety

748
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,877
is for you to
continue your work.

749
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,547
Well, I'll just quit.

750
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,382
You won't.

751
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,925
Why would I not?

752
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:41,012
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

753
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,889
You quit working for me,

754
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,559
I quit working for you.

755
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:02,283
Parcher! Parcher!

756
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,956
John, you all right?

757
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,228
John?

758
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:33,064
Turn it off!
Turn off the light!

759
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:40,196
Why would you do that? Why
would you turn the light on?

760
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,822
What is wrong with you?

761
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:43,991
You have to go
to your sister's.

762
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:45,868
I left the car
at the back.

763
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,995
Now you can take
Commonwealth, no side streets.

764
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,372
John...
Stay where it's crowded.

765
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,332
John,
I'm not going anywhere!

766
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,250
When you get to your sister's,
you wait for me to call.

767
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,335
No, I'm not going.

768
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,711
Just get your things.
I'm not leaving!

769
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:57,296
Stop! Stop it.

770
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,757
Please, Alicia.

771
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:04,053
I'll explain when I can.

772
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:54,103
Uncle John!
Uncle John!

773
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:59,275
Hey, baby girl!

774
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,611
Wow,
someone needed a hug.

775
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:05,698
I saw you on the slate,
and I thought to myself,

776
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,452
"How can I miss seeing a guest
lecture by the inimitable John Nash?"

777
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,832
What's wrong?

778
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,379
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

779
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,339
Well, now you tell me,
what is it?

780
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,383
Professor Nash!

781
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:26,510
Welcome!

782
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:29,763
After?

783
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,735
So, we see that the zeroes
of the Riemann zeta function

784
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:48,240
correspond to singularities
in space-time.

785
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:51,744
Singularities in
space-time then...

786
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,416
And conventional
number theory...

787
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:03,297
It breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

788
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:23,651
Sometimes our expectations
are betrayed by the numbers.

789
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:29,865
Variables are impossible
to assign any rational value.

790
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:50,761
Professor Nash!

791
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:02,773
Hold it!

792
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:03,941
Professor Nash?

793
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:11,574
Professor Nash, let's
avoid a scene, shall we?

794
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:13,993
What do you want?

795
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,579
My name is Rosen.

796
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,747
Dr. Rosen.
I'm a psychiatrist.

797
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:21,959
Forgive me if I
don't seem persuaded.

798
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,545
I'd like you to
come with me, John.

799
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:27,590
Just for a chat.

800
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:30,759
It appears
I have no choice.

801
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:43,981
Help me! Somebody!

802
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,487
Somebody! Help me!

803
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:52,823
Get off me!

804
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,117
I know who you are!
I know who you are!

805
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,119
- No, no, no, don't!
- Charles!

806
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:59,121
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

807
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,956
Call somebody!
Call somebody, Charles!

808
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,541
They're Russians!
Steady the leg.

809
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:04,251
Get away from me.

810
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,337
Stay away from me!

811
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,135
There, now.

812
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,055
All better.

813
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:21,894
Everything's all right here.

814
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:25,814
Watch your head.

815
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,221
John? John?

816
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,849
Can you hear me?

817
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:16,949
Go easy now.

818
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:20,202
Thorazine takes
a little while to wear off.

819
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,457
Sorry about the restraints.

820
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,085
But you've got one
hell of a right hook.

821
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:31,046
Where am I?

822
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,426
MacArthur
Psychiatric Hospital.

823
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,097
I find that
highly unlikely.

824
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:42,850
You made a mistake.

825
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:46,854
My work is non-military
in application.

826
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,481
Which work is that,
John?

827
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,318
I don't know anything.

828
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:56,488
There's no good in
keeping secrets, you know.

829
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:17,259
Charles?

830
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,180
I didn't mean to get
you involved in this.

831
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:24,349
I'm... I'm sorry.

832
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,023
Charles?

833
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:40,699
The prodigal
roommate revealed.

834
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:47,164
"Saw my name on
the lecture slate"?

835
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,874
You lying son of a bitch!

836
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:51,543
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

837
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,129
How do you say "Charles
Herman" in Russian?

838
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:55,589
How do you say it
in Russian?

839
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,217
There's
no one there, John.

840
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:00,302
There's no one there.

841
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:03,055
He's right there.
He's right there.

842
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:08,811
Stop! I don't know anything!
Stop! I don't know anything!

843
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:14,817
My name is John Nash. I'm
being held against my will.

844
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:17,486
Somebody call the
Department of Defense.

845
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,698
My name is John Nash. I'm
being held against my will!

846
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,747
What's wrong
with him?

847
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,836
John has schizophrenia.

848
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:38,173
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

849
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,761
But... But his work.

850
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,389
He deals with conspiracy.
So...

851
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,725
Yes. Yes, I know.

852
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:54,106
In John's world, these behaviors
are accepted, encouraged.

853
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,402
As such, his illness
may have gone untreated

854
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:00,737
far longer than is typical.

855
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:02,781
What do you mean?
How long?

856
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:04,700
Possibly since
graduate school.

857
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:08,412
At least that's when his
hallucinations seem to have begun.

858
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:10,664
What are you talking about?
What hallucinations?

859
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:13,458
One, so far,
that I am aware of.

860
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:16,837
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

861
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,382
Charles isn't imaginary.

862
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,509
He and John have been best
friends since Princeton.

863
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:26,054
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

864
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:28,891
He's always in town for
so little time, lecturing.

865
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,142
Was he at your wedding?

866
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:31,393
He had to teach.

867
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:32,728
Have you seen
a picture of him,

868
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:34,062
or talked to him
on the telephone?

869
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,273
This is ridiculous.

870
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,108
I phoned Princeton.

871
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:42,195
According to their housing
records, John lived alone.

872
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:48,535
Now, which is more likely?
That your husband,

873
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,704
a mathematician with
no military training,

874
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,956
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians...

875
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:54,917
You're making him
sound crazy.

876
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:58,045
Or, that he has lost
his grip on reality?

877
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:04,092
Now, the only way I can help
him is to show him the difference

878
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:07,971
between what is real
and what is in his mind.

879
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,352
Come on.

880
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,522
What's he been
working on?

881
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:20,359
His work is classified.

882
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:25,656
He mentioned a supervisor by
the name of William Parcher.

883
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,283
Maybe Mr. Parcher can
clarify things for us.

884
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:31,203
But I can't get to
him without clearances.

885
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,874
You want me to help you get the
details of my husband's work?

886
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:41,171
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.
Is that what you think?

887
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,220
What did the doctor say?
Is he sick?

888
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,682
I don't know. I want to see
what John's been working on.

889
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:53,642
Alicia, you know,
you can't go in his office.

890
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,144
You know, it's classified,
Alicia. Stop.

891
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:17,666
Oh, my God.

892
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,510
Why didn't you
say something?

893
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:33,557
Alicia, I mean, John has
always been a little weird.

894
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:38,061
He said he was doing code-breaking.
That it was eyes-only.

895
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:41,565
Top-secret, part of the
military effort. Was he?

896
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:43,442
Well, it was possible, you know?

897
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,027
I mean, directives
come down all the time

898
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,653
that some of us
aren't cleared for.

899
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:48,155
It was possible.

900
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,407
Possible, but not likely.

901
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,622
Lately, he'd become so much more
agitated, and then when you called...

902
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:01,209
So, is this all he's
been doing every day?

903
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,128
Cutting up magazines?

904
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,007
Well, not all.

905
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:30,257
I'm so sorry.

906
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,508
It's okay.

907
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,472
I missed you.

908
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,810
I have to talk to you.

909
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,436
Okay.

910
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:51,319
Alicia, I've been
thinking about it,

911
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:54,531
and I do realize
that my behavior

912
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:58,368
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you

913
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:02,706
must have appeared insane. I
left you with no other choice.

914
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:06,251
I do understand,
and I'm truly sorry.

915
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,295
That's okay.

916
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:15,427
Everything is
gonna be all right.

917
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,430
We just have to
talk quietly.

918
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:23,393
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

919
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,479
I'm gonna tell
you everything now.

920
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:30,442
It's breaking with protocol,
but you need to know

921
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:34,738
because you have to
help me get out of here.

922
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:39,576
Alicia, I've been doing
top-secret work for the government.

923
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:43,538
There's a threat that exists
of catastrophic proportions.

924
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:47,876
I think the Russians feel
my profile is too high.

925
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,836
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.

926
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:53,131
They're keeping me here to try
to stop me from doing my work.

927
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:54,925
You have to get to Wheeler.
Stop.

928
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,259
You have to find William Parcher. Stop.

929
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:57,969
He could help us. He
could help us. Stop. Stop.

930
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,721
He could help us...
Stop!

931
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,311
I went to Wheeler.

932
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,063
Good, good.

933
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,148
There is no William Parcher.

934
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,526
Of course there is.
I've been working for him.

935
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:16,279
Doing what?
Breaking codes?

936
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:21,576
Dropping packages in a secret
mailbox for the government to pick up?

937
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,329
How could you know that?

938
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:26,289
Sol followed you.

939
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,001
He thought it was
harmless. Sol followed me?

940
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:41,680
They've never been opened.

941
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:46,184
It isn't real.

942
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:50,313
There is no conspiracy, John.

943
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,235
There is no William Parcher.

944
01:16:56,696 --> 01:16:58,363
It's in your mind.

945
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,827
Do you understand, baby?

946
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,038
You're sick.

947
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:11,876
You're sick, John.

948
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:15,714
John?

949
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:28,810
Code red. Dr. Rosen, code
red. Observation Room 2.

950
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:32,314
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation Room 2.

951
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:48,705
John?

952
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,043
The implant is gone.

953
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,004
I can't find it.

954
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:01,718
It's gone.

955
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,127
You see,
the nightmare of schizophrenia

956
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:38,922
is not knowing what's true.

957
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,967
Imagine if you had
suddenly learned that

958
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:47,847
the people and the places and
the moments most important to you

959
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:50,683
were not gone, not dead,

960
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:54,270
but worse, had never been.

961
01:18:57,817 --> 01:19:00,151
What kind of hell
would that be?

962
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:07,409
Administering insulin.

963
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:10,412
8:42 a.m.

964
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:10,346
How often?

965
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:15,185
Five times a week
for 10 weeks.

966
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,586
John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.

967
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:44,297
And Hansen is running
the department now.

968
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:47,425
So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.

969
01:20:48,219 --> 01:20:49,511
Yeah.

970
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:53,515
John won't come near the campus,
though. I think he's ashamed.

971
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,060
Hey, hey.

972
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,479
Want this?

973
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:03,399
So, Alicia,
how are you holding up?

974
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,111
Well,
delusions have passed.

975
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:10,031
They're saying with the medication
and low stress environment...

976
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:11,324
No...

977
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,910
I mean, how are you?

978
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:23,670
I think often what I feel

979
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:26,089
is obligation.

980
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,469
Or guilt over
wanting to leave.

981
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:37,475
Rage against John,
against God, and...

982
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:41,020
But...

983
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,401
Then I look at him,

984
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:51,489
and I force myself to see
the man that I married.

985
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:54,742
And he becomes that man.

986
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:58,871
He's transformed into
someone that I love.

987
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:05,545
And I'm transformed into
someone who loves him.

988
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,717
It's not
all the time, but

989
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:14,470
it's enough.

990
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:19,017
I think John is
a very lucky man, Alicia.

991
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:25,773
So unlucky.

992
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,279
This is us.
This is it?

993
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:32,530
It's nice.

994
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:33,698
It's near
where I work.

995
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,242
John? You have a visitor.

996
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:43,124
Hi.

997
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,376
I hope it's okay.

998
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:54,344
Hey, chief.

999
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,222
Cigarette?
No, thanks.

1000
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,974
I quit, actually.

1001
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,064
Hello.
Hey, John.

1002
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,526
Have you met Harvey?

1003
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,323
John, there's no...
Relax, it's okay.

1004
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,909
There's no point in being nuts
if you can't have a little fun.

1005
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:21,037
Jesus Christ, John.
You know, I should have known.

1006
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:24,123
Here you go.

1007
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,503
I can take those later.

1008
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,129
You're supposed
to take them now.

1009
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,882
Can I bring you something?

1010
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:34,592
I'm okay.

1011
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:36,094
Okay.

1012
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:43,768
So, yeah, I was in
town giving a workshop.

1013
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:45,603
I go back tonight.

1014
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:50,024
You know, Bender,
he really wanted to stop by

1015
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,860
and, you know, see you.
You know, say hi.

1016
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:54,153
Squeamish?

1017
01:23:56,115 --> 01:23:57,407
Yeah.

1018
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:59,701
I suppose I would be, too.

1019
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:02,120
But, alas,
I'm stuck with me.

1020
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:07,875
I'm trying to solve
the Riemann hypothesis.

1021
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,960
Uh-huh.

1022
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,546
Yeah?

1023
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,383
I figured if I dazzle them

1024
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:18,010
they will have
to reinstate me.

1025
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:22,473
But it's difficult
with the medication

1026
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:26,185
because it's hard to

1027
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:30,440
see the solution.

1028
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:41,242
You know, John,
you should go easy.

1029
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:45,163
There are other things
besides work.

1030
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,001
What are they?

1031
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:28,247
What are you thinking about?

1032
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,252
What do people do?

1033
01:25:33,504 --> 01:25:35,087
It's life, John.

1034
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:37,590
Activities available.

1035
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,259
Just add meaning.

1036
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:50,186
You could try
leaving the house.

1037
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:54,816
You know,
maybe talk to people.

1038
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:03,241
You could try
taking out the garbage.

1039
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:28,266
And there's some more...
There's some more in...

1040
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:42,655
Who...
Who were you talking to?

1041
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:44,824
Garbage man.

1042
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,294
Garbage men
don't come at night.

1043
01:26:59,298 --> 01:27:01,465
I guess around here
they do.

1044
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:28,993
Sorry.

1045
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:37,603
Is it the medication?

1046
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:20,771
I don't know what to do.

1047
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:41,751
My mother's going to keep the
baby a little longer tonight.

1048
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:45,463
I can get three
hours of overtime.

1049
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,032
I'm going to bed.

1050
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,374
Good night.

1051
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:43,622
It's good to
see you, John.

1052
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:46,500
It's been a while.

1053
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:48,752
Parcher?

1054
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:51,005
Yes, sir.

1055
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:55,843
You're not real!

1056
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:58,596
Of course I am.
Don't be ridiculous.

1057
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,686
I don't think that
I would go that way, John.

1058
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,481
It's time for you
to get back to work.

1059
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:13,611
The bomb is in its final
position here in the U.S.

1060
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:17,156
Knowing your
situation requires

1061
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:20,075
you keep a low profile,
Mohammed,

1062
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:23,495
we've brought
the mountain to you.

1063
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:44,266
We've narrowed
the bomb's location

1064
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:47,228
to somewhere on
the eastern seaboard,

1065
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,065
but we haven't been able to
pinpoint its exact position.

1066
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:57,238
Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.

1067
01:32:59,783 --> 01:33:01,492
Look at this, John.

1068
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,956
What? What?

1069
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:10,751
Dr. Rosen said...

1070
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:13,504
Rosen ! That quack!

1071
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:16,840
"Schizophrenic break from reality,"
right? Psychological bullshit!

1072
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:19,677
Look at me, John.

1073
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,012
John, look at me.

1074
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,808
Do I look like
I'm imagined?

1075
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,229
Wheeler has
no record of you.

1076
01:33:30,355 --> 01:33:32,773
Do you think we
list our personnel?

1077
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:37,945
John, I'm sorry you had
to go through all this.

1078
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:41,573
I've gone to a great deal
of trouble to get you back.

1079
01:33:41,992 --> 01:33:44,618
I can restore your
status at Wheeler.

1080
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:47,454
I can let the world
know what you did.

1081
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:49,707
But I need you now,
soldier.

1082
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,465
I was so scared
you weren't real.

1083
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:08,309
There's a storm coming.

1084
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:11,145
I'm just going to
grab the laundry. Okay?

1085
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:12,938
I'll draw his bath.

1086
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:17,735
It's okay.

1087
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:20,946
Okay.

1088
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:00,671
John!

1089
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:10,472
I've almost got it! Charles,
you just watch the baby.

1090
01:36:11,558 --> 01:36:12,599
No!

1091
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:15,060
Oh, God.

1092
01:36:24,237 --> 01:36:26,280
Charles was watching him.
He was okay.

1093
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:27,614
There is no one here.

1094
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,116
Oh, my God!

1095
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,868
Charles was watching him.
There is no one here!

1096
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:32,870
He's been injected
with a cloaking serum.

1097
01:36:32,954 --> 01:36:34,788
I can see him
because of a chemical

1098
01:36:34,873 --> 01:36:36,623
that was released
into my bloodstream

1099
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:38,250
when my implant dissolved.

1100
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,588
I couldn't tell you, it
was for your own protection!

1101
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:46,049
Alicia!

1102
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:52,222
No!

1103
01:36:52,307 --> 01:36:54,308
Hello, I need
Dr. Rosen's office, please.

1104
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:55,726
You've got to
stop her, John.

1105
01:36:58,271 --> 01:36:59,938
You leave her out of it.

1106
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:03,233
Who are you talking to?

1107
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:05,152
It's not her fault.
John.

1108
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:07,488
She'll compromise us again.
No, she won't.

1109
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:08,655
You'll go back
to the hospital.

1110
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:10,032
John, answer me!

1111
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:11,366
Countless people will die.

1112
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:13,243
Alicia, please put
the phone down.

1113
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:14,411
I can't let that happen.

1114
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:17,581
Yes, hello? Hi, I need
Dr. Rosen. Is he in?

1115
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:20,751
I'm sorry, John.

1116
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,212
No!

1117
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:27,841
Alicia.

1118
01:37:27,926 --> 01:37:29,009
You know what you
have to do, Nash.

1119
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:30,135
Get away from me.

1120
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,179
She's too great a risk.
Get away!

1121
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:35,098
I didn't mean
to hurt you!

1122
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:39,603
Finish her.
She knows too much now.

1123
01:37:43,942 --> 01:37:45,484
Uncle John?

1124
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:49,029
You take care of her, you pathetic
piece of shit, or I'll take care of you.

1125
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:53,200
John. Christ, John,
please do what he says.

1126
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,494
Move, soldier.

1127
01:37:55,954 --> 01:37:56,995
Now.

1128
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:58,580
Uncle John?

1129
01:37:59,499 --> 01:38:01,041
John, please!

1130
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,502
Now!

1131
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:06,755
Alicia and Charles never coexist
in the same interactive field.

1132
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:09,258
Parcher and Charles...

1133
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:15,138
Charles and Marcee
cannot coexist with Alicia.

1134
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,310
With Alicia.

1135
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:22,104
I understand.

1136
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:28,235
No!

1137
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:40,122
She never gets old.

1138
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:46,587
Marcee can't be real.
She never gets old.

1139
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:21,246
You see them now?

1140
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:32,049
Yes.

1141
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:35,927
Why did you
stop your meds?

1142
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:40,599
Because I couldn't
do my work.

1143
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:44,269
I couldn't help with
the baby. I couldn't...

1144
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:48,315
I couldn't
respond to my wife.

1145
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:53,654
You think that's better
than being crazy?

1146
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:56,657
We'll need to start
you on a higher run

1147
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:58,700
of insulin shocks
and a new medication.

1148
01:39:58,785 --> 01:39:59,826
No.

1149
01:40:01,162 --> 01:40:02,663
There has to be
another way.

1150
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,414
Schizophrenia
is degenerative.

1151
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:08,794
Some days may be symptom-free, but
over time, you are getting worse.

1152
01:40:08,878 --> 01:40:11,463
It's a problem.
That's all it is.

1153
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:14,466
It's a problem
with no solution.

1154
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:16,343
And that's what I do,
I solve problems.

1155
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:18,220
That's what I do best.
This isn't math.

1156
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,638
You can't come up
with a formula to

1157
01:40:19,722 --> 01:40:21,348
change the way
you experience the world.

1158
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,058
All I have to do
is apply my mind.

1159
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:24,851
There's no theorem,
no proof.

1160
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:26,186
You can't reason
your way out of this.

1161
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:27,354
Why not? Why can't I?

1162
01:40:27,438 --> 01:40:30,607
Because your mind is where the
problem is in the first place.

1163
01:40:32,735 --> 01:40:34,236
I can do this.

1164
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:38,490
I can work it out.
All I need is time.

1165
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:43,537
Is that the baby?

1166
01:40:45,665 --> 01:40:47,666
The baby is at
my mother's, John.

1167
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:08,520
Without treatment, John, the
fantasies may take over entirely.

1168
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:28,623
You almost ready?

1169
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:33,086
Rosen's waiting outside.

1170
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:36,590
I can't go back
to that hospital.

1171
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:42,095
I won't come home.

1172
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:51,938
He said that if you said that he
has commitment papers for me to sign.

1173
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:57,110
Well, maybe you
won't sign them.

1174
01:41:58,696 --> 01:42:00,447
Maybe you'll just
give me some time.

1175
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:05,702
I will try to
figure this out.

1176
01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:12,584
Whatever you do, Rosen
is right about one thing.

1177
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:15,545
You shouldn't be here.

1178
01:42:18,466 --> 01:42:19,633
I'm not safe anymore.

1179
01:42:26,015 --> 01:42:27,724
Would you have
hurt me, John?

1180
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:38,944
I don't know.

1181
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:42,572
Maybe you should let Dr. Rosen
drive you to your mother's.

1182
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:05,470
He told me to leave.

1183
01:43:12,937 --> 01:43:14,271
I understand.

1184
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:52,893
Rosen said to call if you
try and kill me, or anything.

1185
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:12,203
You want to know
what's real?

1186
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:35,185
This.

1187
01:44:37,647 --> 01:44:39,105
This is real.

1188
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:46,905
Maybe the part that knows
the waking from the dream,

1189
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:50,200
maybe it isn't here.

1190
01:44:54,497 --> 01:44:55,872
Maybe it's here.

1191
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:07,217
I need to believe that something
extraordinary is possible.

1192
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:11,698
Come.

1193
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:22,083
Hello, Martin.

1194
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:29,257
Jesus Christ.

1195
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:32,427
No, I...

1196
01:46:34,055 --> 01:46:37,682
I don't have that one. My savior complex
takes on a completely different form.

1197
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:42,937
I heard what happened
and I wanted to write,

1198
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:44,230
and I tried you
at MacArthur's,

1199
01:46:44,315 --> 01:46:45,857
but you'd left,
and I just...

1200
01:46:59,288 --> 01:47:00,705
This is
Helinger's old office.

1201
01:47:01,457 --> 01:47:02,540
Yeah.

1202
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,793
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1203
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:10,090
Seems that you won
after all, Martin.

1204
01:47:12,093 --> 01:47:14,052
They were wrong, John.
No one wins.

1205
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:16,805
Please, please,
have a seat.

1206
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:19,724
God, it's so good
to see you.

1207
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:24,771
What brings you
back to Princeton?

1208
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:29,400
John? John, I'm sorry,
but you have to tell him.

1209
01:47:29,485 --> 01:47:31,778
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!

1210
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:34,614
Tell him your work is
critical. John, please!

1211
01:47:49,755 --> 01:47:52,507
Is there any chance that you
could ignore what I just did?

1212
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:56,386
Of course.
What are old friends for?

1213
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:01,391
Is that what
we are, Martin? Friends?

1214
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:02,767
John, of course.

1215
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:06,020
Of course.
We always have been.

1216
01:48:11,527 --> 01:48:16,489
Alicia and I think that fitting
in, being part of a community,

1217
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:21,661
might do me some good.

1218
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:23,329
That a certain
level of attachment,

1219
01:48:23,414 --> 01:48:24,998
familiar places,
familiar people,

1220
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:30,253
might help me elbow out

1221
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:36,885
these certain delusions
that I have.

1222
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:44,726
It's a lot to ask,
and now that I'm here,

1223
01:48:47,438 --> 01:48:49,189
I'm quite certain that
you will just say no.

1224
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:55,195
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.

1225
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:05,747
Huh.

1226
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:11,461
Will you be
needing an office?

1227
01:49:16,342 --> 01:49:17,383
No.

1228
01:49:20,846 --> 01:49:22,639
No, I could just
work out of the library.

1229
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:26,351
Well, this guy tries to
wander into the library,

1230
01:49:26,435 --> 01:49:27,727
but he doesn't have ID.

1231
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:29,062
Why can't people
read their memos, huh?

1232
01:49:29,146 --> 01:49:30,730
Then, he goes
totally nuts.

1233
01:49:31,148 --> 01:49:34,067
You're not real!
You're not real.

1234
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:36,236
There's no mission.

1235
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,238
Shit. Shit.

1236
01:49:39,365 --> 01:49:41,741
You're not real!
You are not real!

1237
01:49:41,825 --> 01:49:44,911
Is this what you are,
soldier? Some useless ghoul?

1238
01:49:44,995 --> 01:49:46,871
The local madman?

1239
01:49:46,956 --> 01:49:48,164
I'm not a soldier.

1240
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:49,582
You're gonna
end up in a cell!

1241
01:49:49,667 --> 01:49:51,793
Old, worthless, discarded.

1242
01:49:51,877 --> 01:49:53,002
There's no mission.

1243
01:49:53,087 --> 01:49:56,422
And while you rock and drool,
the world will burn to ashes!

1244
01:49:56,507 --> 01:49:58,883
You are not real!
You are not real!

1245
01:49:58,968 --> 01:50:01,094
You're still
talking to me, soldier.

1246
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:04,264
There's no mission!
I'm not a soldier!

1247
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:06,307
John ! John!

1248
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:11,437
Hey, hey, hey.
John, John. It's okay.

1249
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:13,189
I just heard what
happened, I'm sorry. John.

1250
01:50:13,274 --> 01:50:15,024
I'm not a soldier.
John. Hey, Nash.

1251
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:17,777
Nash, hey,
you're all right.

1252
01:50:20,823 --> 01:50:21,906
Nash.

1253
01:50:26,704 --> 01:50:29,580
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1254
01:50:29,665 --> 01:50:30,748
John?

1255
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:35,503
You should've
seen their faces.

1256
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:37,797
Everybody was
just staring at me.

1257
01:50:38,299 --> 01:50:42,927
John, you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1258
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:45,013
I know.

1259
01:50:48,225 --> 01:50:51,728
But then, on the way home,
Charles was there.

1260
01:50:57,067 --> 01:50:59,152
Sometimes, I really
miss talking to him.

1261
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:04,407
Maybe Rosen's right.

1262
01:51:06,243 --> 01:51:08,953
Maybe I have to think about going
back into the hospital again.

1263
01:51:09,621 --> 01:51:11,789
No. Come here.

1264
01:51:16,795 --> 01:51:18,588
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1265
01:51:43,614 --> 01:51:46,491
John, now you can't
ignore me forever.

1266
01:51:52,331 --> 01:51:56,000
Charles, you've been a very
good friend to me. The best.

1267
01:51:58,504 --> 01:51:59,962
But I won't
talk to you again.

1268
01:52:04,134 --> 01:52:05,635
I just can't.

1269
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:13,559
Same goes for you,
baby girl.

1270
01:52:21,819 --> 01:52:32,120
Good-bye.

1271
01:52:46,802 --> 01:52:48,719
I was wondering if
I might audit your course.

1272
01:52:50,848 --> 01:52:53,307
It's an honor,
Professor Nash.

1273
01:52:56,812 --> 01:52:58,020
Is something wrong?

1274
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:01,607
This will be
my first class.

1275
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:09,532
Good morning,
eager young minds.

1276
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:32,096
It's never
going to work, John.

1277
01:53:32,723 --> 01:53:35,183
You're just
humiliating yourself.

1278
01:53:37,853 --> 01:53:41,481
It's pathetic!
You are being pathetic.

1279
01:53:42,357 --> 01:53:43,816
I'm ashamed of you!

1280
01:54:11,595 --> 01:54:12,845
Man!

1281
01:54:17,226 --> 01:54:19,769
Are you coming?
You're going to be late.

1282
01:54:23,023 --> 01:54:24,815
Dad, you've got my book.
What?

1283
01:54:25,609 --> 01:54:27,026
You've got my book.

1284
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:28,444
Right.

1285
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:30,071
Thanks.

1286
01:54:31,615 --> 01:54:32,865
Good-bye.
Bye.

1287
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:34,116
See you tonight.

1288
01:54:35,494 --> 01:54:36,911
Bye, honey.

1289
01:56:09,796 --> 01:56:11,172
Did you just solve Riemann?

1290
01:56:11,256 --> 01:56:12,673
Well, what do you think?

1291
01:56:13,717 --> 01:56:14,759
Huh.

1292
01:56:14,843 --> 01:56:17,803
That's an analog to Frobenius
for non-commutative extensions.

1293
01:56:20,182 --> 01:56:21,557
Yes, it is.

1294
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:25,269
But it only appears to
work sporadically, so, no.

1295
01:56:27,272 --> 01:56:29,231
But I believe
I'm making progress.

1296
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:35,237
You're John Nash, right?

1297
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:40,368
Toby Kelly.
Hello.

1298
01:56:40,452 --> 01:56:42,078
I've been studying
your equilibrium,

1299
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:43,871
the one you wrote
here at Princeton.

1300
01:56:43,955 --> 01:56:46,457
To come up with something
totally original, the way you did.

1301
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:48,209
You know, I was young.

1302
01:56:50,087 --> 01:56:52,588
I've been developing
a theory.

1303
01:57:07,145 --> 01:57:11,524
I believe I can prove that Galois
extensions are covering spaces.

1304
01:57:11,608 --> 01:57:13,734
That everything,
everything is connected.

1305
01:57:13,819 --> 01:57:16,237
That it's all part
of the same subject.

1306
01:57:17,656 --> 01:57:19,281
When was the last time
you ate?

1307
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,158
Excuse me?

1308
01:57:21,284 --> 01:57:22,576
You know, food.

1309
01:57:23,412 --> 01:57:24,412
Oh... Uh...

1310
01:57:24,496 --> 01:57:27,790
My wife,
she loves mayonnaise.

1311
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:32,128
Thank you.

1312
01:57:34,131 --> 01:57:35,297
Go on.

1313
01:57:36,133 --> 01:57:39,427
The function is in
the two categories.

1314
01:57:39,511 --> 01:57:40,803
Mmm-hmm.

1315
01:57:44,641 --> 01:57:45,641
Alicia!

1316
01:57:47,436 --> 01:57:48,728
Alicia!

1317
01:57:48,812 --> 01:57:50,730
...and meet together
at a maximum speed

1318
01:57:50,814 --> 01:57:53,566
of, let us say,
10 miles per hour.

1319
01:57:54,359 --> 01:57:56,652
So you have a fly on
the tire of bicycle "B,"

1320
01:57:57,404 --> 01:58:00,448
and the fly, who can
travel at 20 miles an hour,

1321
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:03,701
leaves the tire of bicycle "B" and
flies to the tire of bicycle "A,"

1322
01:58:03,785 --> 01:58:07,246
and backwards and forwards, and so on
and so forth, until the two bikes collide

1323
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:09,623
and the poor
little fly is squashed.

1324
01:58:09,708 --> 01:58:13,753
This is the important thing about
actually focusing in and comprehending

1325
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:16,756
the area that you're dealing
with. Mathematics is very specific,

1326
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:20,259
and it is an art form, no matter what
these people around here will tell you,

1327
01:58:20,343 --> 01:58:21,844
especially the people
from Biology.

1328
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:23,429
Don't listen to
any of those people.

1329
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:25,514
Let me go back to
what you were doing before

1330
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:26,891
because I think I
might want to steal this

1331
01:58:26,975 --> 01:58:28,225
and write a book
and get famous.

1332
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:32,104
I was thinking
that I might teach.

1333
01:58:34,566 --> 01:58:37,401
A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.

1334
01:58:39,321 --> 01:58:42,114
John, besides,
you're a terrible teacher.

1335
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:44,992
I'm an acquired
taste, Martin.

1336
01:58:46,536 --> 01:58:49,205
I was hoping there still might
be something I could contribute.

1337
01:58:50,207 --> 01:58:51,373
What about the...

1338
01:58:52,292 --> 01:58:55,127
Well, you know.
Are they gone?

1339
01:59:02,344 --> 01:59:04,136
No, they're not gone.

1340
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:06,722
And maybe
they never will be.

1341
01:59:06,807 --> 01:59:07,807
But I've gotten
used to ignoring them,

1342
01:59:07,891 --> 01:59:10,810
and I think, as a result,
they've given up on me.

1343
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:14,647
You think that's
what it's like with

1344
01:59:14,731 --> 01:59:17,066
all our dreams and
our nightmares, Martin?

1345
01:59:18,235 --> 01:59:20,611
You've got to keep feeding
them for them to stay alive?

1346
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:23,322
John,
they haunt you though.

1347
01:59:25,158 --> 01:59:28,244
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody is haunted by their past.

1348
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:34,124
Well, good-bye.

1349
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:35,709
John, I'll talk
to the department.

1350
01:59:38,421 --> 01:59:39,755
Maybe in the spring.

1351
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:47,513
Hey, Nash.

1352
01:59:49,641 --> 01:59:53,310
You scared?

1353
01:59:56,356 --> 02:00:00,526
Terrified.
Mortified. Petrified.

1354
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,111
Stupefied by you.

1355
02:00:03,154 --> 02:00:05,739
Now you ought best ring Alicia,
or you're gonna get me...

1356
02:00:05,824 --> 02:00:07,491
I'll ring her. ...in
an awful lot of trouble.

1357
02:00:12,038 --> 02:00:13,747
Thanks, Professor.
Good-bye.

1358
02:00:13,832 --> 02:00:15,666
Have a nice day.
Good-bye.

1359
02:00:16,751 --> 02:00:18,586
Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.
Monday, sir.

1360
02:00:18,962 --> 02:00:20,504
Professor Nash?

1361
02:00:23,925 --> 02:00:25,050
Can you see him?

1362
02:00:25,886 --> 02:00:27,469
Yeah.
You sure?

1363
02:00:28,138 --> 02:00:31,515
Positive? He's within
your vision? Good.

1364
02:00:32,684 --> 02:00:35,185
Forgive me, I'm just always
suspicious of new people.

1365
02:00:35,312 --> 02:00:36,896
See you next week,
Professor. See you next week.

1366
02:00:38,773 --> 02:00:40,566
So now that I know
that you're real,

1367
02:00:40,692 --> 02:00:42,484
who are you,
and what can I do for you?

1368
02:00:43,987 --> 02:00:46,405
Professor,
my name is Thomas King.

1369
02:00:46,489 --> 02:00:47,615
Thomas King?
Mmm-hmm.

1370
02:00:47,699 --> 02:00:51,785
And I'm here to tell you that you're
being considered for the Nobel Prize.

1371
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,338
Forgive me, but I'm
just a little stunned.

1372
02:01:02,422 --> 02:01:06,175
Over the past few years, your
equilibrium has become a cornerstone

1373
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:07,593
of modern economics.

1374
02:01:08,094 --> 02:01:09,845
Suddenly,
everybody likes that one.

1375
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:14,600
What about my work on other some such
projects, like manifold embedding?

1376
02:01:14,684 --> 02:01:18,395
The application of
your bargaining problem

1377
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:22,316
to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...

1378
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:23,901
Antitrust cases?
Yes.

1379
02:01:23,985 --> 02:01:26,028
I never would
have considered that.

1380
02:01:26,112 --> 02:01:31,158
Have I just reached some level of
honesty that borders on stupidity?

1381
02:01:31,242 --> 02:01:33,118
No, you haven't.

1382
02:01:33,203 --> 02:01:35,079
Because I wouldn't
have thought of that.

1383
02:01:40,293 --> 02:01:41,543
Shall we have tea?

1384
02:01:44,089 --> 02:01:47,967
I don't go in there. I usually just
take my sandwich in the library.

1385
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:51,887
Come on, John. Let's have
some tea. It's a big day.

1386
02:01:52,931 --> 02:01:56,392
Most commercially
available brands of tea

1387
02:01:56,476 --> 02:01:58,602
are not suitable to
my palate, you see.

1388
02:01:58,687 --> 02:02:00,104
I'm not...

1389
02:02:00,188 --> 02:02:03,482
There are some Northern Indian
teas which are dense enough.

1390
02:02:03,566 --> 02:02:05,567
I enjoy the flavor
that they have.

1391
02:02:05,652 --> 02:02:08,612
I have not been in this room
for quite some many years.

1392
02:02:08,697 --> 02:02:10,656
I wonder what tea
they serve.

1393
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:14,702
Why, thank you,
young lady.

1394
02:02:16,538 --> 02:02:20,374
Things have certainly changed
around here. I have a son that age.

1395
02:02:22,127 --> 02:02:23,335
Harvard.

1396
02:02:28,258 --> 02:02:29,258
Hmm.

1397
02:02:29,342 --> 02:02:31,510
I would have thought

1398
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:34,346
the nominations for the Nobel
Prize would've been secret.

1399
02:02:35,223 --> 02:02:37,808
I would have thought you'd only
find out if you won or lost.

1400
02:02:38,727 --> 02:02:40,185
That is generally
the case, yes,

1401
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:42,187
but these are
special circumstances.

1402
02:02:44,274 --> 02:02:45,941
The awards are substantial.

1403
02:02:46,818 --> 02:02:49,820
They require private funding.
As such,

1404
02:02:50,989 --> 02:02:53,115
the image of the Nobel is...

1405
02:02:55,618 --> 02:02:58,495
Oh, I see. So, you came here
to find out if I was crazy?

1406
02:02:59,831 --> 02:03:03,751
Find out if I would screw
everything up if I actually won?

1407
02:03:05,378 --> 02:03:08,589
Dance around the podium, strip
naked and squawk like a chicken,

1408
02:03:08,673 --> 02:03:10,049
things of this nature?

1409
02:03:10,133 --> 02:03:11,925
Something like that, yes.

1410
02:03:13,595 --> 02:03:14,928
Would I embarrass you?

1411
02:03:19,476 --> 02:03:20,809
Yes, it is possible.

1412
02:03:24,314 --> 02:03:28,776
You see, I am crazy.

1413
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:33,030
I take the
newer medications,

1414
02:03:37,118 --> 02:03:39,286
but I still see things
that are not here.

1415
02:03:42,207 --> 02:03:43,832
I just choose not
to acknowledge them.

1416
02:03:46,669 --> 02:03:50,839
Like a diet of the mind, I choose
not to indulge certain appetites.

1417
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:55,469
Like my appetite
for patterns.

1418
02:03:57,639 --> 02:04:00,849
Perhaps my appetite
to imagine and to dream.

1419
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:03,685
Professor Nash.

1420
02:04:08,858 --> 02:04:10,984
It's good to
have you here, John.

1421
02:04:12,237 --> 02:04:13,570
Thank you.

1422
02:04:18,284 --> 02:04:19,910
It's an honor, sir.

1423
02:04:20,745 --> 02:04:21,870
Thank you very much.

1424
02:04:22,747 --> 02:04:24,039
A privilege, Professor.

1425
02:04:28,878 --> 02:04:30,212
Professor.

1426
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:36,802
Nicely done, John.

1427
02:04:36,928 --> 02:04:38,262
Thank you, Tom.

1428
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:44,017
Thank you.

1429
02:04:52,569 --> 02:04:54,069
Thank you, Ed.

1430
02:05:02,579 --> 02:05:04,663
That was certainly
most unexpected.

1431
02:05:26,811 --> 02:05:28,145
Thank you.

1432
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:34,276
I've always
believed in numbers,

1433
02:05:35,987 --> 02:05:38,947
in the equations and logics
that lead to reason.

1434
02:05:40,366 --> 02:05:42,465
But after a lifetime of such pursuits,

1435
02:05:43,749 --> 02:05:46,955
I ask, what truly is logic?

1436
02:05:48,666 --> 02:05:50,083
Who decides reason?

1437
02:05:52,212 --> 02:05:57,132
My quest has taken me through
the physical, the metaphysical,

1438
02:05:59,427 --> 02:06:03,513
the delusional and back.

1439
02:06:05,975 --> 02:06:08,644
And I have made the most
important discovery of my career.

1440
02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:13,482
The most important
discovery of my life.

1441
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:19,655
It is only in the mysterious
equations of love

1442
02:06:20,949 --> 02:06:23,283
that any logical
reasons can be found.

1443
02:06:27,288 --> 02:06:29,623
I'm only here tonight
because of you.

1444
02:06:31,668 --> 02:06:33,252
You are the reason I am.

1445
02:06:38,716 --> 02:06:40,217
You are all my reasons.

1446
02:06:45,223 --> 02:06:46,556
Thank you.

1447
02:07:41,070 --> 02:07:42,404
So nice to
have met you.

1448
02:07:45,783 --> 02:07:47,326
I'll call for the car, Dad.

1449
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:48,702
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1450
02:07:51,164 --> 02:07:52,456
Are you ready to go now?

1451
02:07:52,582 --> 02:07:53,874
Yes, I am.

1452
02:07:53,958 --> 02:07:55,709
Yes, indeed,
and yes, please.

1453
02:07:56,461 --> 02:07:57,836
Thank you so much.

1454
02:07:59,172 --> 02:08:00,505
Thank you.

1455
02:08:03,509 --> 02:08:05,427
What is it?
What's wrong?

1456
02:08:09,849 --> 02:08:11,099
Nothing.

1457
02:08:12,435 --> 02:08:13,435
Nothing at all.

1458
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:17,481
Come with me,
young lady.

1459
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:23,487
I have a car outside.
Are you interested in a ride?

1460
02:08:24,614 --> 02:08:26,281
Where's it going to?
