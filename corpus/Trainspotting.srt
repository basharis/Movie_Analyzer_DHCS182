00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:17,167
Every chance you've had, son,

85

The Sick Boy method.

94
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:44,569
Well, it really worked
for him, eh?

95
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:46,571
He's always been lacking
in moral fiber.

96
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:47,974
He knows a lot
about Sean Connery.

97
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:50,283
That's hardly a substitute.

98
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:52,202
You need one more hit.

99
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:53,369
No, I don't think so.

100
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:55,705

107
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:36,037
<i>Soothing music.

00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,843
<i>This was typical

That's all I've got, man.

135
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:55,950
Take it or leave it.

136

Are you feeling better now?

137
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:10,507
For all the good

138
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:13,301
I might as well have

139
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,514
<i>Heroin makes you constipated.</i>

140

143
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,815
<i>I'm no longer constipated.</i>

144
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:38,243
<i>I fantasize about massive

145
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:41,913
<i>Brilliant gold taps,
virginal-white marble,</i>

146
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:45,333
<i>a seat carved from ebony,
a cistern full of Chanel No. 5,</i>

147

<i>and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll.</i>

148
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:53,133
<i>But under the circumstances,
I'll settle for anywhere.</i>

149
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:06,604
Ohh.

150
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:15,238
Fuck.

151
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:17,323
Ohh! Oh!

152
00:09:21,286 --> 00:09:22,286
Ahh.

153
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:50,875
Yes, a fucking Godsend!

154
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,373
<i>And now.</i>

155
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:32,167
<i>Now I'm ready.</i>

156
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:34,961
<i>The downside of coming off junk</i>

157
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:37,005
<i>was I knew I would mix
with my friends</i>

158
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,048
<i>in a state of full
consciousness.</i>

159
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:40,467
<i>It was awful.</i>

160
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:42,010
<i>They reminded me of myself.</i>

161
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:43,845
<i>I could hardly bear
to look at them.</i>

162
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,555
<i>Take Sick Boy, for instance.</i>

163
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,348
<i>He came off junk
at the same time.</i>

164
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,267
<i>Not because he wanted to.</i>

165
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,351
<i>Just to annoy me.</i>

166
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:52,479
<i>Just to show me
how easily he could do it,</i>

167
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:55,023
<i>thereby downgrading
my own struggle.</i>

168
00:11:55,106 --> 00:11:57,150
<i>Sneaky fucker, don't you think?</i>

169
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:00,320
<i>When I wanted to lie there
and feel sorry for myself,</i>

170
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:02,197
<i>he insisted on telling me
once again</i>

171
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,282
<i>about his unifying theory
of life.</i>

172
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:07,702
It's certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life.

173
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,120
What do you mean?

174
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:12,373
Well, at one point,
you've got it.

175
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,043
Then you lose it,
and it's gone forever.

176
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,836
All walks of life.

177
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:20,840
Georgie Best, for example,
had it, lost it.

178
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:23,510
Or David Bowie, or Lou Reed.

179
00:12:23,593 --> 00:12:25,595
Lou Reed? Some of his
solo stuff's not bad.

180
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,473
No, it's not bad, but it's not
great either, is it?

181
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:30,058
In your heart, you kind of know

182
00:12:30,141 --> 00:12:34,604
that although it sounds all
right, it's actually just shite.

183
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,274
So who else?

184
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:42,904
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven,
Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.

185
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:46,533
Okay, okay, so what is the point
you're trying to make?

186
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,246
All I am trying to do, Mark,
is to help you understand

187
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,249
that "The Name of the Rose"
is merely a blip

188
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:57,377
on an otherwise uninterrupted
downward trajectory.

189
00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:59,754
And what about
"The Untouchables"?

190
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:02,507
I don't rate that at all.

191
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,717
Despite the Academy Award?

192
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,262
That means fuck all.

193
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,347
It's a sympathy vote.

194
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:14,727
So we all get old, we can't hack
it anymore, and that's it?

195
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:16,771
Yeah.

196
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,815
That's your theory?

197
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:21,234
Yeah.

198
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,696
Beautifully fucking illustrated.

199
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:27,991
Give me the gun.

200
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:30,243
Give me the gun.

201
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,002
Do you see the beast?

202
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:41,421
Have you got it in your sights?

203
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,965
Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.

204
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,803
This should present
no significant problems.

205
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,145
Aah! No!
Fuck! Aah!

206
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:02,025
For a vegetarian, Rents,
you're a fucking evil shot.

207
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:04,194
No! Get off!

208
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:06,780
<i>Without heroin,
I attempted to lead a useful</i>

209
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:08,948
<i>and fulfilling life
as a good citizen.</i>

210
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:16,623
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers, Cowboy.

211
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:19,793
Remember, if they think you're
not trying, you're in trouble.

212
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:21,795
First hint of that,
they'll be on to the DHSS.

213
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,630
"This cunt is not trying."

214
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:25,840
And your giro is
fucking finished, right?

215
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,425
But then again, try too hard...

216
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,344
You might get the fucking job.

217
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,261
Exactly.

218
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:31,137
Nightmare.

219
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,807
It's a tightrope, Spud.
It's a fucking tightrope.

220
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:36,559
See, I just get pure shy
with the interviewer cats.

221
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:38,937
I get all nervous.
I can't answer the questions.

222
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,482
I'm a footballer, and I get
nerves on the big occasion, man.

223
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:43,775
Try some of this, Spud.

224
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:47,028
Yeah, a little dab of speed
is just the ticket, man.

225
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,657
No, I went to Craigy.
Craig Newton.

226
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,618
I just put down Royal Edinburgh
College to help get the job.

227
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,703
There's too much discrimination
in this town.

228
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:56,996
They're both schools.

229
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,665
We're all in this together.

230
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:01,501
I want to put across the general
idea rather than the details.

231
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:03,128
People get hung up on details.

232
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:05,547
Which school did I go to?
How many grades did I get?

233
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,382
It could be six.
Could be none.

234
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,716
It's not important.

235
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:11,928
What is important
is that I am, yes?

236
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:15,932
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you
lied on your application?

237
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:17,183
No!

238
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:20,353
Yes, only to get my foot
in the door.

239
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:21,771
Showing initiative and that.

240
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:23,982
You were referred by
the Department of Employment.

241
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:26,943
There was no need for you to get
your "foot in the door,"

242
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:28,570
as you put it.

243
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:31,364
Cool. Whatever you say, man.
Sorry.

244
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:33,366
You're the man,
the dude in the chair.

245
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,828
I am merely here.
But obviously I'm here.

246
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:39,164
Mr. Murphy,
what exactly attracts you

247
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:41,207
to the leisure industry?

248
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:44,878
In a word, pleasure.

249
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:47,255
Like, my pleasure
in other people's leisure.

250
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,758
Do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses?

251
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:55,763
Oh, yes, 'cause I'm a bit
of a perfectionist, actually.

252
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:56,764
Yes, I am.

253
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,976
See, for me, it's got to be the
best, or it's nothing at all.

254
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:02,770
Like, if things get a bit dodgy,
I cannot be bothered.

255
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:06,232
But I've got good vibes about
this interview thing today.

256
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:09,068
Seems to me like
it's going pretty well.

257
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:12,363
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

258
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:15,283
We'll let you know.

259
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:16,409
The pleasure was mine.

260
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:19,078
<i>Spud had done well.
I was proud of him.</i>

261
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:23,124
<i>He fucked up good and proper.
You had to hand it to Spud.</i>

262
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:26,753
Picture the scene.

263
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:29,380
The other fucking week,
doing the fucking volley.

264
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:30,799
Me and Tommy playing pool.

265
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:33,176
I'm playing like
Paul fucking Newman by the way.

266
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:36,179
Giving the boy here
the tanning of a lifetime.

267
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:38,473
So it comes to the last shot.

268
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,725
The deciding ball
of the whole tournament.

269
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:42,409
I'm on the black,
and he's in the corner,

270
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:44,479
looking all fucking
biscuit-arsed,

271
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,731
when this hard cunt comes in.

272
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:49,567
Obviously fucking
fancied himself, like.

273
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:51,402
Starts staring at me.

274
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:53,113
Looking at me,
right fucking at me,

275
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:55,865
as if to say,
"Come ahead, square, go."

276
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,990
You know me.

277
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:59,285
I'm not a type of cunt
that goes looking for bother.

278
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,996
At the end of the day,
I'm the cunt with the pool cue,

279
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:05,583
and he can get the fire end
in his puss anytime he wanted.

280
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,711
So I squares up, casual like.

281
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:12,757
What does the hard cunt do?
Or the so-called hard cunt?

282
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:14,092
Shites it.

283
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:18,054
Puts down his drink, turns,
and gets the fuck out of there.

284
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,350
And after that,
well, the game was mine.

285
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:27,939
<i>And that was it.</i>

286
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:29,816
<i>That was Begbie's story.</i>

287
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:32,318
<i>At least that was Begbie's
version of the story.</i>

288
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:35,363
<i>But a couple of days later
I got the truth from Tommy.</i>

289
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,282
<i>You always got the truth
from Tommy.</i>

290
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,159
<i>It was one of
his major weaknesses.</i>

291
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:41,327
<i>He never told lies,
he never took drugs,</i>

292
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:43,371
<i>and he never cheated on anyone.</i>

293
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,498
It was Wednesday morning.

294
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:47,542
We were in the volley
playing pool.

295
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,043
That much is true.

296
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:53,256
But Begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash.

297
00:17:53,381 --> 00:17:56,050
He's got a hangover so bad
he can hardly hold the cue,

298
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,635
never mind pot a ball.

299
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,721
I'm doing my best to lose,
you know.

300
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,599
Trying to humor him, like,
but it's not doing any good.

301
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:05,310
Every time I touch a ball,
I seem to pot something.

302
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:08,146
Every time Begbie goes near
the table, he fucks it up.

303
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:10,732
Oh, fuck's sake.

304
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,819
So he's got the hump, right?

305
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:18,281
But finally I manage to set it
up so all he has to do

306
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:20,408
is to pot the black
to win one game

307
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,202
to salvage a little bit of pride

308
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:24,871
and maybe not kick
my head in, right?

309
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:29,042
So he's on the black,
pressure shot.

310
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:34,047
And it all goes wrong, big-time.

311
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:36,925
Fuck!

312
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:38,718
Aah!

313
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:41,596
He picks on this specky
wee gadgee at the bar

314
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,057
and accuses him of putting him
off by looking at him.

315
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,140
Can you believe it?

316
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,060
The cunt hasn't glanced
in our direction.

317
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:48,269
Fuck off!

318
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,647
He was going to chib him,
I tell you.

319
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:53,149
Then I thought
he was going to do me.

320
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:58,696
The beggar's
fucking psycho, man.

321
00:18:59,697 --> 00:19:03,409
But he's a mate, you know,
so what can you do?

322
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:05,203
Can I borrow this?

323
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:07,413
<i>What indeed could one do?</i>

324
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:10,208
<i>Just stand back and watch
and try not to get involved.</i>

325
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:15,004
<i>Begbie didn't do drugs, either.
He just did people.</i>

326
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,925
<i>That's what he got off on.
His own sensory addiction.</i>

327
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:23,138
Nobody move!

328
00:19:24,472 --> 00:19:25,723
That lassie got glassed,

329
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:28,977
and no cunt leaves here till
we find out what cunt did it.

330
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,603
Who the fuck are you?

331
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:32,939
Yes!

332
00:19:33,064 --> 00:19:34,774
Ohh!

333
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,669
Oh, Tom!
Oh, my God!

334
00:19:58,006 --> 00:19:59,466
Oh, Lizzy!

335
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:00,592
Oh, Lizzy!

336
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:02,969
Oh, Tom, come in me!

337
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:04,262
<i>And as I sat watching</i>

338
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:06,723

00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,145

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,190

I read it in "Cosmopolitan."

347
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,571
It's an interesting theory.

348
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,240
Actually, it's a nightmare.

349
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:06,825
I've been desperate for a shag,

350
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:10,161
but watching him suffer
was just too much fun.

351
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:11,871
You should try it with Tommy.

352
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:15,333
What, and deny myself the only
pleasure I get from him?

353
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,960
Did I tell you about
my birthday?

354
00:21:17,085 --> 00:21:17,794
What happened?

355
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,380
He forgot.
Useless motherfucker.

356
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,993
What are you two talking about?

357
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:51,911
Football!

358
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:53,413
What are you talking about?

359
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:54,914
Shopping.

360
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:58,460
<i>The situation
was becoming serious.</i>

361
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:01,754

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,483
<i>but now it returned
with a vengeance.</i>

369
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:24,777
<i>And as the impotence of
those days faded into memory,</i>

370
00:22:24,903 --> 00:22:28,573
<i>grim desperation took a hold

385
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:51,364
Excuse me,
I don't mean to harass you,

386
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:53,992
but I was very impressed
with the capable manner

387
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:55,577
in which you dealt with that.

388
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:58,121
I was thinking to myself,
"This girl's special."

389
00:23:58,246 --> 00:23:59,246
Thanks.

390
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,207
- What's your name?
- Diane.

391
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,376
- Where are you going, Diane?
- I'm going home.

392
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:05,211
- Where's that?
- It's where you live.

393
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:06,336
Great.

394
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:07,464
What?

395
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:11,009
I'll come back with you,
but I'm not promising anything.

396
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:13,511
Do you find that this approach
usually works?

397
00:24:13,595 --> 00:24:16,097
Or, let me guess,
you've never tried it before.

398
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:19,225
In fact, you don't normally
approach girls, am I right?

399
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,270
The truth is that you're
a quiet, sensitive type,

400
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:24,189
but if I'm prepared to
take a chance,

401
00:24:24,272 --> 00:24:26,441
I might just get to know
the inner you.

402
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:30,945
Witty, adventurous, passionate,
loving, loyal.

403
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,947
Taxi!

404
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,450
A little bit crazy,
a little bit bad.

405
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:39,537
But, hey, don't us girls
just love that?

406
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:43,792
Well, what's wrong, boy?

407
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,376
Cat got your tongue?

408
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,545
I left something.

409
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:50,548
Are you getting in or not, pal?

410
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:13,738
Do you understand?

411
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:17,117
I expect you to be a considerate
and thoughtful lover.

412
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,244
Generous but firm.

413
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:20,078
What?

414
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:23,498
Failure on your part to live up
to these reasonable expectations

415
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:28,211
will result in swift resumption
of a non-sex situation.

416
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:29,629
Right?

417
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,476
Diane.

418
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:44,644
Shh!

419
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:45,395
What?

420
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,647
Shut up!

421
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:29,856
Wake up, Spud.

422
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:31,983
Wake up.

423
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:33,860
Sex.

424
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:37,030
Casual sex.

425
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:47,040
Tommy, let's put the tape on.

426
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:48,123
Now?

427
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:50,877
I want to watch ourselves
while we're screwing.

428
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,713
So let's see what I'm missing.

429
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:10,188
Not much.

430
00:27:12,232 --> 00:27:13,525
Pushed forward again.

431
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:15,568
And there's the captain,
Archie Gemmill,

432
00:27:15,652 --> 00:27:17,612
picking it up from the outside.

433
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:19,114
I think he wants to go himself.

434
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,407
He's gonna go.
He's going all the way.

435
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:22,909
And he scores!

436
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:25,703
Oh, what a magnificent goal!

437
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:27,914
Gemmill at his very best!

438
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:31,084
What a penetrating goal
that was!

439
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:32,877
I haven't felt that good

440
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:36,381
since Archie Gemmill scored
against Holland in 1978.

441
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:41,636
You can't sleep here.

442
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,972
- What?
- Out.

443
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,265
Come on!

444
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,101
No argument. You can sleep on
the sofa in the hall or go home.

445
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:49,602
It's up to you.

446
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:53,398
And don't make any noise.

447
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:55,984
Jesus!

448
00:28:02,532 --> 00:28:04,409
What do you mean, "It's gone"?

449
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:08,204
- Where has it gone, Tommy?
- It'll be here somewhere!

450
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:12,000
I might have returned it
by mistake.

451
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,126
Returned it?

452
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:17,088
Where?
The video shop, Tommy?

453
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:19,799
The fucking video shop?

454
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:24,262
So every punter in Edinburgh
is jerking off to our video?

455
00:28:24,846 --> 00:28:28,016
Oh, God, Tommy, I feel sick.

00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Aye.

469
00:29:55,562 --> 00:29:56,729

of a friend, no?

473
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,616
Right.

474
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,204
Are you her flatmates, like?

475
00:30:14,873 --> 00:30:16,749
Flatmates?

476
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,710
I must remember that one.

477
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:21,671
Morning.

478
00:30:36,603 --> 00:30:38,188
Good morning, Spud.

479
00:30:38,313 --> 00:30:41,441
Gail.
Mr. Houston, Mrs. Houston.

480
00:30:41,524 --> 00:30:44,611
Good morning, Spud. Sit down
and have some breakfast.

481
00:30:47,322 --> 00:30:49,115
I'm sorry about last night,
by the way.

482
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,327
That's all right.
I slept fine on the sofa.

483
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:57,290
I had a bit much to drink.
I had a bit of an accident.

484
00:30:57,373 --> 00:30:59,417
Don't worry, son.
These things happen.

485
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:02,796
It does a man good to cut loose
once in a while.

486
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:05,799
This one could do with being
tied up once in a while.

487
00:31:05,882 --> 00:31:07,634
I'll put the sheets
in the machine.

488
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:09,803
No, no, no, I'll wash them.

489
00:31:09,886 --> 00:31:11,638
- There's no need.
- It's no problem.

490
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:12,764
It's no problem for me.

491
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:14,474
I'd rather take care
of it myself.

492
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,809
Honestly, it's no problem.

493
00:31:15,892 --> 00:31:16,892
Really, no!

494
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:19,145
Spud, they're my sheets!

495
00:31:31,741 --> 00:31:32,826
I don't see why not.

496
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:34,619
Because it's illegal.
That's why not.

497
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:35,787
What? Holding hands?

498
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,996
Not holding hands.

499
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:38,665
In that case, you can do it.

500
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,957
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.

501
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:41,185
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.

502
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,710
Yeah, and that's what's illegal.

503
00:31:42,836 --> 00:31:44,396
Do you know what they'd do
to me inside?

504
00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:46,881
They cut your balls off and
flush them down the toilet.

505
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,967
Calm down.
You're not going to jail.

506
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:51,344
Well, that's very easy
for you to say, Diane.

507
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:54,347
- Can I see you again?
- Certainly not!

508
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,809
If you don't see me again,
I'll tell the police.

509
00:32:00,562 --> 00:32:02,605
I'll see you around then.

510
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:17,203
Now what?

511
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:18,872
We're going for a walk.

512
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:19,998
What?

513
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:21,749
A walk!

514
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:23,709
Where?

515
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:25,336
There!

516
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:28,882
Are you serious?

517
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:04,667
Well, what are you waiting for?

518
00:33:05,168 --> 00:33:06,419
Tommy.

519
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:10,256
This is not natural, man.

520
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:13,468
It's the great outdoors!

521
00:33:13,593 --> 00:33:15,136
It's fresh air.

522
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:18,264
Look, Tommy, we know you're
getting a hard time off Lizzy,

523
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:21,267
but there's really no need
to take it out on us.

524
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:23,311
Doesn't it make you proud
to be Scottish?

525
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:26,272
It's shite being Scottish!

526
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:28,483
We're the lowest of the low.

527
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:30,944
The scum of the fucking Earth.

528
00:33:31,027 --> 00:33:33,446
The most wretched,
miserable, servile,

529
00:33:33,571 --> 00:33:37,158
pathetic trash that was ever
shat into civilization.

530
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:39,160
Some people hate the English.
I don't.

531
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:40,954
They're just wankers.

532
00:33:41,037 --> 00:33:44,624
We, on the other hand,
are colonized by wankers.

533
00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:48,753
We can't even find a decent
culture to be colonized by.

534
00:33:48,878 --> 00:33:51,631
We're ruled by effete arseholes.

535
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:53,925
It's a shite state of affairs
to be in, Tommy,

536
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:55,426
and all the fresh air
in the world

537
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,221
won't make any fucking
difference!

538
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,065
Sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

539
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,943
No, I appreciate it, Tommy.

540
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:13,528
<i>At or around this time,</i>

541
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:16,114
<i>Spud, Sick Boy, and I made
a healthy, informed,</i>

542
00:34:16,197 --> 00:34:19,868
<i>Democratic decision to get back
on heroin as soon as possible.</i>

543
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:22,162
<i>It took about 12 hours.</i>

544
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:29,335
<i>It looks easy, this,
but it's not.</i>

545
00:34:29,461 --> 00:34:32,255
<i>It looks like a doss,
like a soft option.</i>

546
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,218
<i>But living like this,
it's a full-time business.</i>

547
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:58,364
Ursula Andress.

548
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,742
The quintessential Bond Girl.

549
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:02,911
That's what everyone says.

550
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:07,207
The embodiment, right,
of his superiority to us.

551
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:10,710
Beautiful, exotic,
highly sexual,

552
00:35:10,835 --> 00:35:16,049
yet totally unavailable
to anyone apart from him.

553
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:17,300
Shite.

554
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:18,927
I mean, let's face it, mate.

555
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:20,804
She'd shag one punter
from Edinburgh,

556
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:23,014
she'd shag
the whole fucking lot of us.

557
00:35:34,442 --> 00:35:35,902
Well done.

558
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:39,072
I knew he was gonna do that.

559
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:50,041
Lizzy's gone, Mark.

560
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,086
She's gone
and fucking dumped me.

561
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:56,256
It was that videotape

562
00:35:56,381 --> 00:35:57,966
and that Iggy Pop business

563
00:35:58,091 --> 00:35:59,926
and other sorts of shit.

564
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:03,972
She told me where to go
and no fucking mistake.

565
00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:06,057
I said to her,

566
00:36:06,141 --> 00:36:07,981
"Is there any chance
of getting back together?"

567
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:11,146
But no way, no fucking way.

568
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:16,776
Honor Blackman, A.K.A.
Pussy Galore, right?

569
00:36:16,901 --> 00:36:20,280
What a total fucking misnomer.

570
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:24,117
I mean, I wouldn't touch her
with yours.

571
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:26,494
I want to try it, Mark.

572
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:30,331
You're always going on about how
it's the ultimate hit.

573
00:36:30,457 --> 00:36:32,333
Better than sex.

574
00:36:36,045 --> 00:36:37,839
Come on, man,
I'm a fucking adult.

575
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:40,425
I can find out for myself.

576
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,681
I've got the money.

577
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:53,480
Personality. I mean,
that's what counts, right?

578
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:54,481
Personality.

579
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:58,193
That's what keeps a relationship
going through the years.

580
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:01,613
Like heroin.

581
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:08,119
I mean, heroin's got great
fucking personality.

Oh, my God, no!
Please, no!

<i>It had been days

<i>though someone must have said
something in all that time.</i>

615
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:16,122
<i>Surely to fuck,
someone must have.</i>

616
00:39:16,206 --> 00:39:18,875
- Allison! Allison!
- Help me, please!

617
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,168
Calm down!

618
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:23,463
Everything's going to be
just fine.

619
00:39:23,546 --> 00:39:26,341
<i>Nothing could have been further

620
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:29,052
<i>In point of fact, nothing was

621
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:31,971
<i>On the contrary,
everything was going to be bad.</i>

622

<i>Bad?</i>

623
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:37,435
<i>I mean everything was gonna be
even worse than it already was.</i>

624
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,113
No!

625
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:56,913
Fuck.

<i>She wasn't my baby.</i>

<i>Baby Dawn, she wasn't mine.</i>

00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:12,512
<i>Spud's? Swanney's?

632
00:40:12,637 --> 00:40:14,514
<i>I don't know.</i>

633
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:17,433
<i>Maybe Allison knew.
Maybe not.</i>

634
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:20,478
<i>I wished I could think of
something to say,</i>

635
00:40:20,562 --> 00:40:23,481
<i>something sympathetic,
something human.</i>

636
00:40:23,565 --> 00:40:25,775
Say something, Mark.

637
00:40:28,444 --> 00:40:31,698
Fucking say something!

638
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,539
I'm cooking up.

639
00:40:56,431 --> 00:40:58,725
Cook us up a shot, Rents.

640
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,352
I need a hit.

641
00:41:02,228 --> 00:41:05,106
<i>And so she did.
I could understand that.</i>

642
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:07,484
<i>To take the pain away.</i>

643
00:41:08,651 --> 00:41:11,529
<i>So I cooked up,
and she got a hit.</i>

644
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:13,615
<i>But only after me.</i>

645
00:41:13,698 --> 00:41:15,992
<i>That went without saying.</i>

646
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:20,705
<i>Well, at least we knew
who the father was now.</i>

647
00:41:20,789 --> 00:41:23,166
<i>It wasn't just the baby
that died that day.</i>

648
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:25,227
<i>Something inside Sick Boy
was lost and never returned.</i>

649
00:41:25,251 --> 00:41:27,271
<i>Something inside Sick Boy
was lost and never returned.</i>

650
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:28,588
<i>It seemed he had no theory</i>

651
00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:30,799
<i>with which to explain a moment
like this.</i>

652
00:41:30,924 --> 00:41:32,759
<i>Nor did I.</i>

653
00:41:32,884 --> 00:41:35,929
<i>Our only response was to keep
on going and fuck everything.</i>

654
00:41:36,054 --> 00:41:38,097
<i>Pile misery upon misery,</i>

655
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:40,683
<i>heap it up on a spoon
and dissolve it with bile,</i>

656
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:43,061
<i>then squirt it into a stinking,
purulent vein,</i>

657
00:41:43,144 --> 00:41:44,938
<i>and do it all over again.</i>

658
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:47,148
<i>Keep on going, getting up,
going out, robbing,</i>

659
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:48,775
<i>stealing, fucking people over,</i>

660
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,443
<i>propelling ourselves
with longing</i>

661
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:53,071
<i>towards the day
that it would all go wrong.</i>

662
00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:56,366
<i>Because no matter how much you
stash or how much you steal,</i>

663
00:41:56,491 --> 00:41:57,826
<i>you never have enough.</i>

664
00:41:57,951 --> 00:42:00,620
<i>No matter how often you go out
and rob and fuck people over,</i>

665
00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:03,915
<i>you always need to get up
and do it all over again.</i>

666
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:11,673
<i>Sooner or later, this kind
of thing was bound to happen.</i>

667
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,764
Because shoplifting is theft,
which is a crime,

668
00:42:19,848 --> 00:42:21,432
and despite
what you may believe,

669
00:42:21,558 --> 00:42:24,352
there is no such entity
as victimless crime.

670
00:42:24,477 --> 00:42:26,117
Heroin addiction
may explain your actions,

671
00:42:26,146 --> 00:42:27,981
but it does not excuse them.

672
00:42:28,064 --> 00:42:30,275
Mr. Murphy,
you are a habitual thief,

673
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:32,360
devoid of regret and remorse.

674
00:42:32,443 --> 00:42:34,487
In sentencing you
to six months imprisonment,

675
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:38,074
my only worry is it will not
be long before we meet again.

676
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:40,785
Mr. Renton, I understand
that you have entered

677
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:42,662
into a program of rehabilitation

678
00:42:42,787 --> 00:42:45,874
in an attempt to wean yourself
away from heroin.

679
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:48,543
The suspension of your sentence

680
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:51,921
is conditional on your continued
cooperation with this program.

681
00:42:52,046 --> 00:42:54,007
Should you stand guilty
before me again,

682
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:57,385
I shall not hesitate to impose
a custodial sentence.

683
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,721
Thank you, Your Honor.

684
00:42:59,846 --> 00:43:03,766
With God's help, I'll conquer
this terrible affliction.

685
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:19,991
<i>What can you say?</i>

686
00:43:20,074 --> 00:43:22,494
<i>Well,
Begbie had a phrase for it.</i>

687
00:43:22,577 --> 00:43:25,205
It was obvious that cunt
was going to fuck some cunt.

688
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,707
Well, I hope you learnt
your lesson, son.

689
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:31,544
Oh, my son, I thought
I was gonna lose you there.

690
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:36,216
You're nothing but trouble
to me, but I still love you!

691
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:39,719

00:44:14,295 --> 00:44:17,423
That wasn't any fair.
Spud going down and not me.

703
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:21,719
Well, it's not our fault!

704
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:25,431
Your boy went down
because he was a smack-head,

705
00:44:25,557 --> 00:44:28,852
and if that's not your fault,
then I don't know what is.

706
00:44:30,854 --> 00:44:33,940
That was that fucking cunt.

707
00:44:36,985 --> 00:44:38,111

723
00:45:31,664 --> 00:45:33,249
What's on the menu
this evening, sir?

724
00:45:33,374 --> 00:45:36,169
- Your favorite dish.
- Excellent.

725
00:45:36,294 --> 00:45:38,838
- Usual table, sir?
- Oh, why, thank you.

726
00:45:38,963 --> 00:45:42,175
Would sir care to pay
for his bill in advance?

727
00:45:42,258 --> 00:45:43,843
No, stick it on my tab.

728
00:45:43,968 --> 00:45:45,178

729
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:48,348
credit limit was reached and
breached quite some time ago.

730
00:45:48,473 --> 00:45:50,809
Oh, well, in that case.

731
00:45:51,267 --> 00:45:53,478
Hard currency!
That'll do nicely.

732
00:45:53,561 --> 00:45:56,981
Can't be too careful when we're
dealing with your type, can we?

733
00:45:58,066 --> 00:46:01,027
Would sir care for a starter?
Some garlic bread perhaps?

734
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,446
No, thank you.
I'll proceed directly

00:55:01,818 --> 00:55:06,239

00:57:56,034 --> 00:57:58,578
Tommy, it's Mark, man.

867
00:58:06,711 --> 00:58:08,588
Renton.

868
00:58:31,069 --> 00:58:32,487
Getting out much, Tommy?

869
00:58:32,612 --> 00:58:34,197
No.

870
00:58:37,784 --> 00:58:39,786
Following the game at all?

871
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:41,663
No.

872
00:58:43,206 --> 00:58:45,542
Nah, me neither, really.

873
00:58:55,844 --> 00:58:58,012
You take the test?

874
00:58:59,597 --> 00:59:01,432
Aye.

875
00:59:03,268 --> 00:59:05,228
Clear?

876
00:59:05,979 --> 00:59:07,438
Aye.

877
00:59:09,357 --> 00:59:11,526
That's nice.

878
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:16,364
I'm sorry, Tommy.

879
00:59:18,658 --> 00:59:20,535
Got any gear on you?

880
00:59:21,703 --> 00:59:23,746
No, I'm clean, man.

881
00:59:24,664 --> 00:59:28,710
Well, sub us, then, mate.

882
00:59:29,836 --> 00:59:31,629
I'm expecting a rent check.

883
00:59:46,144 --> 00:59:47,645
Thanks, Mark.

884
00:59:48,271 --> 00:59:50,231
No bother.

885
00:59:54,152 --> 00:59:56,988
<i>No bother, none at all.</i>

886
00:59:57,071 --> 00:59:58,573
<i>Not for me, anyway.</i>

887
00:59:58,698 --> 01:00:00,658
<i>It's easy to be philosophical</i>

888
01:00:00,742 --> 01:00:03,828
<i>when it's some other poor cunt
with shite for blood.</i>

889
01:00:11,628 --> 01:00:13,338
What do you want?

890
01:00:13,421 --> 01:00:15,256
- Are you clean?
- Yes.

891
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:17,008
Is that a promise, then?

892
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:18,551
Yes, it is.

893
01:00:18,635 --> 01:00:21,596
Calm down.
I'm only asking.

894
01:00:25,058 --> 01:00:27,936
- Is that hash I can smell?
- No.

895
01:00:28,061 --> 01:00:29,687
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.

896
01:00:29,813 --> 01:00:32,232
- Well, it isn't.
- It smells like it.

897
01:00:32,357 --> 01:00:36,110
- You're too young.
- I'm too young for what?

898
01:00:44,244 --> 01:00:46,538
You're not getting
any younger, Mark.

899
01:00:46,621 --> 01:00:49,249
The world's changing.
Music's changing.

900
01:00:49,374 --> 01:00:50,917
Even drugs are changing.

901
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:52,460
You can't stay in here all day

902
01:00:52,585 --> 01:00:55,630
dreaming about heroin
and Ziggy Pop.

903
01:00:55,755 --> 01:00:57,423
It's Iggy Pop.

904
01:00:57,549 --> 01:01:00,093
Whatever.
I mean, the guy's dead anyway.

905
01:01:00,218 --> 01:01:03,221
Iggy Pop is not dead.
He toured last year.

906
01:01:03,346 --> 01:01:06,933
The point is, you've got
to find something new.

907
01:01:09,018 --> 01:01:12,689
<i>She was right.
I had to find something new.</i>

908
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:14,065
<i>There was only one thing for it.</i>

909
01:01:14,107 --> 01:01:15,387

01:01:59,777 --> 01:02:02,655
Oh, yes, it's a beautifully
converted Victorian townhouse.

916
01:02:02,739 --> 01:02:04,532
Ideally located in a quiet road,

917
01:02:04,657 --> 01:02:06,951
near to the local shops
and transport.

918
01:02:07,076 --> 01:02:10,038
This one's two bedrooms
and a kitchen/diner.

919
01:02:10,163 --> 01:02:12,749
Fully fitted in excellent
decorative order.

920
01:02:12,832 --> 01:02:15,168
Lots of storage space,
and all mod cons.

921
01:02:15,293 --> 01:02:18,880
And it's going at £320 a week.

922
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:29,140
<i>I settled in not too badly
and kept myself to myself.</i>

923
01:02:29,224 --> 01:02:30,850
<i>Sometimes,
I thought about the guys,</i>

924
01:02:30,975 --> 01:02:33,102
<i>but mainly I didn't miss them
at all.</i>

925
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:34,771
<i>After all, this was Boomtown,</i>

926
01:02:34,854 --> 01:02:38,566
<i>where any fool could make cash
from chaos and plenty did.</i>

927
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:42,445
I've got a beautifully converted
Victorian townhouse.

928
01:02:42,529 --> 01:02:44,197
<i>I quite enjoyed

<i>subletting, subdividing,</i>

01:02:49,494 --> 01:02:52,163
<i>cheating, scamming,

932
01:02:52,247 --> 01:02:54,040
Who's got the keys
to Telegraph Road?

933
01:02:54,165 --> 01:02:56,435
<i>There was no such thing as
society, and even if there was,</i>

934
01:02:56,459 --> 01:02:59,504
<i>I most certainly had nothing
to do with it.</i>

935
01:02:59,629 --> 01:03:03,424
<i>For the first time in my adult
life, I was almost content.</i>

936
01:03:04,676 --> 01:03:05,844
<i>"Dear Mark..."</i>

937
01:03:05,969 --> 01:03:08,721
<i>I'm glad you've found a job
and somewhere to live.</i>

938
01:03:08,847 --> 01:03:10,557
<i>School is fine at the moment.</i>

939
01:03:10,682 --> 01:03:13,434
<i>I'm not pregnant,
but thanks for asking.</i>

940
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,688
<i>Your friend Sick Boy asked me
last week to work for him,</i>

941
01:03:16,813 --> 01:03:18,731
<i>but I told him where to go.</i>

942
01:03:18,857 --> 01:03:21,192
<i>I met Spud,
who sends his regards,</i>

943
01:03:21,276 --> 01:03:23,611
<i>"or at least I think
that's what he said."</i>

944
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:28,700
<i>"No one has seen Tommy for ages."</i>

945
01:03:28,825 --> 01:03:32,871
<i>And finally, Francis Begbie

946
01:03:32,954 --> 01:03:34,205
<i>as he is wanted by the police</i>

947
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:36,040
<i>in connection

948
01:03:36,124 --> 01:03:37,750
<i>in a jeweler's in Corstorphine.</i>

Oh, no.

Armed robbery?
With a replica?

953
01:03:59,564 --> 01:04:02,400
I mean, how can it be armed
robbery with a fucking replica?

954
01:04:02,525 --> 01:04:04,944
Fucking scandal.

955
01:04:05,236 --> 01:04:08,198
And the gear.
Look.

956
01:04:10,074 --> 01:04:13,620
Supposed to be solid silver.
It's fucking garbage.

957
01:04:13,745 --> 01:04:16,623
There's couples investing
all their hopes in that stuff.

01:04:16,706 --> 01:04:19,125
- It's a scandal, Franco.
- Too fucking right it is.

959
01:04:19,209 --> 01:04:21,419

<i>setting up "contacts,"

Good chips.

1031
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:01,950

01:09:13,753 --> 01:09:15,839
I wouldn't have bothered.

1037
01:09:18,258 --> 01:09:20,635
Fucking rented, anyway.

1038
01:09:21,469 --> 01:09:23,346
You going to eat that?

1039
01:09:28,852 --> 01:09:30,895
Have you got a passport?

1040
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:32,564
Why?

1041
01:09:32,647 --> 01:09:34,399
I met this bloke.

1042
01:09:34,524 --> 01:09:36,568
Runs a hotel, a brothel.

1043
01:09:36,651 --> 01:09:38,611
Loads of contacts.

1044
01:09:38,736 --> 01:09:39,863
Does a nice sideline

1045
01:09:39,946 --> 01:09:42,574
in punting British passports
to foreigners.

1046
01:09:42,657 --> 01:09:44,409
Get you a good price.

1047
01:09:44,492 --> 01:09:47,454
And why would I want
to sell my passport?

1048
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:53,376
It was just an idea.

1049
01:09:54,627 --> 01:09:56,629
<i>I had to get rid of them.</i>

1050
01:09:56,754 --> 01:10:00,049
<i>Sick Boy didn't do his drug
deal, and he didn't get rich.</i>

1051
01:10:00,133 --> 01:10:02,427
<i>Instead, he and Begbie
hung around my bed-sit</i>

1052
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:04,012
<i>looking for things to steal.</i>

1053
01:10:04,137 --> 01:10:07,765
<i>I decided to put them in
the worst place in the world.</i>

1054
01:10:11,227 --> 01:10:15,440
<i>♪ Sandman goes, two in tow ♪</i>

1055
01:10:15,523 --> 01:10:17,525
<i>♪ Wet and dumb ♪</i>

1056
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:25,658
<i>♪ Coming down again ♪</i>

1057
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:36,211
<i>They weren't paying any rent,</i>

1058
01:10:36,336 --> 01:10:38,963
<i>so when my boss
found two suckers who would,</i>

1059
01:10:39,088 --> 01:10:42,050
<i>Sick Boy and Begbie were bound
to feel threatened.</i>

1060
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:45,720
Yep, lots of storage.
All mod cons.

1061
01:10:45,845 --> 01:10:47,972
320 quid a week.

1062
01:10:49,682 --> 01:10:51,226
- Aah!
- Aah!

1063
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:52,685
<i>And that was that.</i>

1064
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,189
<i>But by then we had another
reason to go back.</i>

1065
01:10:56,314 --> 01:10:57,565
<i>Tommy.</i>

1066
01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:59,692
Tommy knew he'd got
the virus, like,

1067
01:10:59,818 --> 01:11:02,570
but he never knew
he'd gone full-blown.

1068
01:11:02,695 --> 01:11:04,739
What was it,
pneumonia or cancer?

1069
01:11:04,864 --> 01:11:07,325
No, toxoplasmosis.

1070
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:09,369
Sort of like a stroke.

1071
01:11:09,452 --> 01:11:10,954
How's that?

1072
01:11:11,704 --> 01:11:14,290
He wanted to see Lizzy again.

1073
01:11:14,874 --> 01:11:16,960
She wouldn't let him
near the house.

1074
01:11:17,043 --> 01:11:20,672
So he bought her a present,
brought her this kitten.

1075
01:11:20,797 --> 01:11:22,715
I bet Lizzy told him
where to stick it.

1076
01:11:22,799 --> 01:11:25,844
Exactly. "I'm not wanting
that cat," she says.

1077
01:11:25,969 --> 01:11:27,262
Get the fuck, right.

1078
01:11:27,387 --> 01:11:30,682
So there's Tommy stuck
with this kitten.

1079
01:11:30,807 --> 01:11:32,007
You can imagine what happened.

1080
01:11:32,058 --> 01:11:34,519
To those of us
gathered here today,

1081
01:11:34,602 --> 01:11:38,815
Thomas McKenzie filled a number
of different roles in our lives.

1082
01:11:38,898 --> 01:11:40,483
- What?
- Thomas was a son.

1083
01:11:40,567 --> 01:11:42,152
The thing was neglected.

1084
01:11:42,235 --> 01:11:44,529
Pissing and shitting
all over the place.

1085
01:11:44,654 --> 01:11:45,697
Tommy's lying about,

1086
01:11:45,822 --> 01:11:49,200
fucked out of his eyeballs
on smack or downers.

1087
01:11:49,325 --> 01:11:52,745
He never knew you could get
toxoplasmosis from cat shit.

1088
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:57,625
A loving man with a great lust
for life.

1089
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:00,044
Neither did I.
What is it?

1090
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:02,338
Fucking horrible.

1091
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:04,299
It's like an abscess
in your brain.

1092
01:12:04,424 --> 01:12:06,217
Fucking hell.

1093
01:12:06,342 --> 01:12:07,469
Then what happened?

1094
01:12:07,594 --> 01:12:10,180
He starts getting
these headaches,

1095
01:12:10,263 --> 01:12:13,516
so he just uses more smack,
you know, for the pain, like.

1096
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,685
And then he has a stroke.

1097
01:12:15,768 --> 01:12:19,606
A fucking stroke.
Just like that.

1098
01:12:19,731 --> 01:12:22,692
Gets home from the hospital
and dies three weeks later.

1099
01:12:23,943 --> 01:12:25,278
He'd been dead for ages

1100
01:12:25,403 --> 01:12:27,530
before the neighbors
complained about the smell

1101
01:12:27,614 --> 01:12:30,533
and got the police
to break down the door.

1102
01:12:30,617 --> 01:12:32,952
Tommy was lying facedown
in a pool of vomit.

1103
01:12:33,077 --> 01:12:34,704
He has gone from us,

1104
01:12:34,788 --> 01:12:38,208
but we have many things
to remember him by.

1105
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:39,292
The kitten was fine.

1106
01:12:39,417 --> 01:12:42,629
Would you all please rise now
for the committal?

1107
01:12:45,965 --> 01:12:51,054

- Tommy.

1116
01:13:34,806 --> 01:13:36,766
Did you tell him yet?

1117
01:13:37,809 --> 01:13:38,852
On you go.

1118
01:13:38,977 --> 01:13:40,436
What?

1119
01:13:40,562 --> 01:13:42,188
There's this mate of Swanney's.

1120
01:13:42,313 --> 01:13:44,023
You know the guy.
Mikey Forrester.

1121
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:45,358
Aye.

1122
01:13:45,859 --> 01:13:51,197
Well, he's come into some gear.

1123
01:13:51,322 --> 01:13:52,322
A lot of gear.

1124
01:13:52,407 --> 01:13:53,867
How much gear?

1125
01:13:55,660 --> 01:14:00,832
About two kilos, so he tells me.

1126
01:14:00,915 --> 01:14:04,043
He got drunk in a pub down
by the docks last week,

1127
01:14:04,169 --> 01:14:06,629
where he met
two Russian sailors.

1128
01:14:06,754 --> 01:14:09,340
They're fucking carrying
this stuff for sale,

1129
01:14:09,424 --> 01:14:10,842
there and then, like.

1130
01:14:10,925 --> 01:14:14,345
So he wakes up the next morning,

1131
01:14:14,429 --> 01:14:18,183
realizes what he's done,
gets very fucking nervous.

1132
01:14:18,266 --> 01:14:19,851
He wants rid of this, right?

1133
01:14:19,976 --> 01:14:20,976
So?

1134
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:24,856
So he met me, and I offered
to take it off his hands

1135
01:14:24,939 --> 01:14:27,609
at a very reasonable price,
with the intention

1136
01:14:27,734 --> 01:14:30,278
of punting it on myself
to a guy I know in London.

1137
01:14:30,403 --> 01:14:31,196
Ho ho-ho-ho!

1138
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:33,281
We've just come back
from Tommy's funeral,

1139
01:14:33,406 --> 01:14:35,867
and you're talking
about a scag deal?

1140
01:14:37,452 --> 01:14:38,870
Aye.

1141
01:14:42,624 --> 01:14:44,459
What was your price?

1142
01:14:44,584 --> 01:14:46,544
- Four grand.
- You haven't got four grand?

1143
01:14:46,669 --> 01:14:48,296
We're £2,000 short.

1144
01:14:48,421 --> 01:14:50,632
Well, that's tough.

1145
01:14:50,757 --> 01:14:54,636
Look, every cunt knows you've
been saving up down in London.

1146
01:14:54,761 --> 01:14:56,888
I'm sorry.
I do not have two grand.

1147
01:14:57,972 --> 01:14:59,933
Aye, you fucking do.

1148
01:15:01,434 --> 01:15:03,144
I've seen your bank statement.

1149
01:15:03,269 --> 01:15:05,563
For fuck's sake.

1150
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:10,068
£2, 133.

1151
01:15:10,151 --> 01:15:13,404
Two kilos.
What is that, 10 years?

1152
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:15,240
Mikey Forrester?
Russian sailors?

1153
01:15:15,365 --> 01:15:17,450
What the fuck
are you boys on, eh?

1154
01:15:17,575 --> 01:15:19,244
Spud, you've already been
to jail.

1155
01:15:19,369 --> 01:15:21,830
What's the deal? You like it
so much you want to go back?

1156
01:15:21,955 --> 01:15:24,332
I just want the money, Mark.

1157
01:15:24,457 --> 01:15:26,334
If everybody keeps
their mouth shut,

1158
01:15:26,459 --> 01:15:29,003
there'll be no cunt
going to jail.

1159
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:35,260
<i>There were a lot
of possibilities running</i>

1160
01:15:35,385 --> 01:15:38,012
<i>through my mind about
what might happen in London.</i>

1161
01:15:38,138 --> 01:15:41,349
<i>Things I didn't want to talk
to anyone about,</i>

1162
01:15:41,474 --> 01:15:44,519
<i>ideas best kept to myself.</i>

1163
01:15:44,644 --> 01:15:46,688
<i>No one told me
when we bought the scag,</i>

1164
01:15:46,813 --> 01:15:49,566
<i>some lucky punter
would have to try it out.</i>

1165
01:15:53,736 --> 01:15:55,363
<i>Begbie didn't trust Spud.</i>

1166
01:15:55,488 --> 01:15:57,866
<i>Sick Boy was too careful
these days.</i>

1167
01:15:57,991 --> 01:16:01,119
<i>So I rolled up my sleeve,
I spiked my vein,</i>

1168
01:16:01,244 --> 01:16:02,954
<i>and I did what had to be done.</i>

1169
01:16:06,749 --> 01:16:08,626
It's good.

1170
01:16:08,751 --> 01:16:11,838
Oh, it's really fucking good.

1171
01:16:12,589 --> 01:16:15,884
Mmm. Ohh.

1172
01:16:16,009 --> 01:16:18,470
<i>Yeah, that hit was good.</i>

1173
01:16:18,595 --> 01:16:21,473
<i>I promised myself another one
before I got to London.</i>

1174
01:16:21,598 --> 01:16:24,976
<i>Just the one like.
For old time's sake.</i>

1175
01:16:25,101 --> 01:16:27,812
<i>Just to piss Begbie off.</i>

1176
01:16:27,937 --> 01:16:29,647
<i>This was his nightmare.</i>

1177
01:16:29,772 --> 01:16:32,484
<i>The dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams</i>

1178
01:16:32,609 --> 01:16:34,489
<i>being perpetrated with three
of the most useless</i>

1179
01:16:34,611 --> 01:16:38,156
<i>and unreliable fuck-ups
in town.</i>

1180
01:16:38,281 --> 01:16:39,824
<i>I knew what was going on
in his mind.</i>

1181
01:16:39,949 --> 01:16:42,452
<i>Any trouble in London, and
he would dump us immediately.</i>

1182
01:16:42,535 --> 01:16:43,536
<i>One way or another.</i>

1183
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,996
<i>He had to.</i>

1184
01:16:45,121 --> 01:16:47,332
<i>If he got caught
with a bagful of scag,</i>

1185
01:16:47,457 --> 01:16:48,958
<i>on top of
that armed-robbery shit,</i>

1186
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:51,669
<i>he was going down for 15 to 20.</i>

1187
01:16:52,045 --> 01:16:53,922
<i>Begbie was hard, but not so hard</i>

1188
01:16:54,047 --> 01:16:57,008
<i>that he didn't shite it
off 20 years in Sultan.</i>

1189
01:17:04,307 --> 01:17:06,851
<i>This was to be my final hit.</i>

1190
01:17:06,976 --> 01:17:08,812
<i>But let's be clear about this.</i>

1191
01:17:08,895 --> 01:17:11,981
<i>There's final hits
and final hits.</i>

1192
01:17:12,065 --> 01:17:14,067
<i>What kind was this to be?</i>

1193
01:17:19,114 --> 01:17:20,907
Did you bring the cards?

1194
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,534
- What?
- The cards.

1195
01:17:22,617 --> 01:17:25,203
The last thing I told you
was to mind the cards.

1196
01:17:25,286 --> 01:17:27,413
Well, I've not brought them.

1197
01:17:29,415 --> 01:17:31,751
Fucking boring after a while
without the cards.

1198
01:17:31,876 --> 01:17:34,003
I'm sorry.

1199
01:17:34,087 --> 01:17:36,297
- Bit fucking late.
- Why didn't you bring them?

1200
01:17:36,422 --> 01:17:40,135
'Cause I fucking told you
to bring them, you doss cunt!

1201
01:17:40,927 --> 01:17:42,137
Christ.

1202
01:18:29,559 --> 01:18:31,144
These are your friends, right?

1203
01:18:31,269 --> 01:18:34,314
These are the guys
I told you about.

1204
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:36,816
- Well, is he here?
- Yeah, he's here.

1205
01:18:36,941 --> 01:18:38,818
You didn't get followed,
did you?

1206
01:18:38,943 --> 01:18:40,987
We didn't get followed.

1207
01:18:41,112 --> 01:18:42,447
Okay.

1208
01:18:59,506 --> 01:19:00,673
All right.

1209
01:19:00,799 --> 01:19:01,966
Aye.

1210
01:19:04,636 --> 01:19:07,180
<i>Straightaway he clocked us
for what we were.</i>

1211
01:19:07,305 --> 01:19:10,266
<i>Small-time wasters
with an accidental big deal.</i>

1212
01:19:21,236 --> 01:19:22,946
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1213
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:20,920
So how much would you like
for this?

1214
01:20:23,423 --> 01:20:25,008
£20,000.

1215
01:20:26,676 --> 01:20:29,804
Well, I don't think it's worth
much more than £ 15,000.

1216
01:20:29,929 --> 01:20:31,723
<i>This was a real drag to him.</i>

1217
01:20:31,806 --> 01:20:33,725
<i>He didn't need to negotiate.</i>

1218
01:20:33,808 --> 01:20:36,060
<i>What the fuck were we going
to do if he didn't buy it?</i>

1219
01:20:36,144 --> 01:20:38,813
<i>Sell it on the streets?
Fuck that!</i>

1220
01:20:38,938 --> 01:20:40,732
Well, £ 19,000.

1221
01:20:40,815 --> 01:20:43,610
I'm terribly sorry.
I can't go to £ 19,000.

1222
01:20:46,279 --> 01:20:48,615
Well, fucking £ 16,000, then.

1223
01:20:50,658 --> 01:20:51,658
Okay.

1224
01:20:51,701 --> 01:20:54,287
Well, fucking £ 16,000
it is, then.

1225
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:01,961
These, gentlemen,
are £2,000 bundles.

1226
01:21:02,086 --> 01:21:04,839
Here's two.

1227
01:21:04,964 --> 01:21:06,674
That's four.

1228
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,177
<i>We settled on £16, 000.</i>

1229
01:21:09,302 --> 01:21:13,056
<i>He had more in the suitcase,
but it was better than nothing.</i>

1230
01:21:20,146 --> 01:21:22,690
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

1231
01:21:22,816 --> 01:21:25,401
I'd like to say it's been
a pleasure haggling with you.

1232
01:21:25,485 --> 01:21:27,737
Fucking brand-new,
by the way.

1233
01:21:30,198 --> 01:21:31,198
Okay.

1234
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:35,703
- Yes!
- Yes!

1235
01:21:35,829 --> 01:21:37,205
Fucking...

1236
01:21:38,123 --> 01:21:40,875
<i>And just for a moment,
it felt really great.</i>

1237
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,877
<i>Like we were in it together,
like friends.</i>

1238
01:21:43,002 --> 01:21:44,462
<i>Like it meant something.</i>

1239
01:21:44,587 --> 01:21:47,048
<i>A moment like that
can touch you deep inside.</i>

1240
01:21:47,173 --> 01:21:48,674
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like £16, 000.</i>

1241
01:21:48,675 --> 01:21:50,236
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like £16, 000.</i>

1242
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:53,388
So what about you, Spud, any
investments on the horizon?

1243
01:21:53,513 --> 01:21:55,723
Gonna buy yourself
a wee island in the sun?

1244
01:21:55,849 --> 01:21:56,850
For four fucking grand?

1245
01:21:56,975 --> 01:22:01,020
One palm tree, a couple
of rocks, and a sewage outflow.

1246
01:22:01,938 --> 01:22:04,232
I don't know, man.

1247
01:22:04,357 --> 01:22:06,818
I'm gonna get something
for my ma.

1248
01:22:06,901 --> 01:22:11,114
Get some good speed, no bicarb.

1249
01:22:11,197 --> 01:22:13,241
And get a girl, take her out,
treat her right.

1250
01:22:13,366 --> 01:22:14,366
Shag her senseless.

1251
01:22:14,451 --> 01:22:16,494
No, man!
True love.

1252
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:17,996
True love.

1253
01:22:18,121 --> 01:22:19,497
Hey, but I could handle

1254
01:22:19,622 --> 01:22:22,500
some hot sex
with a Jewish Princess.

1255
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:24,669
- You daft cunt!
- Or a Catholic!

1256
01:22:24,794 --> 01:22:25,855
If you're gonna waste it
on a bird,

1257
01:22:25,879 --> 01:22:28,339
you may as well fucking
leave all of it to me.

1258
01:22:28,465 --> 01:22:29,841
Now get the drinks.

1259
01:22:29,966 --> 01:22:33,094
- I got the last one.
- It's your round, Franco.

1260
01:22:34,637 --> 01:22:36,598
Okay.
Same again?

1261
01:22:36,723 --> 01:22:39,142
Right.
I'm off for a pish.

1262
01:22:39,225 --> 01:22:41,811
See when I get back
the money's still here, okay?

1263
01:22:41,895 --> 01:22:43,831
The moment your back's turned,
we're out the door.

1264
01:22:43,855 --> 01:22:45,440
I'll be right fucking after you.

1265
01:22:45,565 --> 01:22:48,193
You'll never catch us,
you flabby bastard.

1266
01:22:48,318 --> 01:22:50,570
By the way, see when I get back.

1267
01:22:50,695 --> 01:22:53,198
Be halfway down the street
with the money.

1268
01:22:53,323 --> 01:22:54,699
Fucking kill you.

1269
01:22:54,824 --> 01:22:57,035
I thought you might, Franco.

1270
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,661
I thought you might.

1271
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:05,376
Are you game for it?

1272
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:07,003
What?

1273
01:23:08,713 --> 01:23:10,173
Well?

1274
01:23:11,257 --> 01:23:12,842
Are you serious?

1275
01:23:20,892 --> 01:23:21,892
Don't know.

1276
01:23:21,935 --> 01:23:23,436
What do you think?

1277
01:23:24,771 --> 01:23:25,939
Still here, I see.

1278
01:23:26,064 --> 01:23:28,441
Oh, well, we wouldn't
run out on a mate, eh?

1279
01:23:28,566 --> 01:23:30,902
Why not?
I know I would.

1280
01:23:31,778 --> 01:23:33,446
Where's Franco?

1281
01:23:36,032 --> 01:23:38,535
For fuck's sake!

1282
01:23:38,618 --> 01:23:39,828
Sorry, mate.

1283
01:23:39,953 --> 01:23:43,248
You ruined my fucking suit,
you fucking idiot.

1284
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:44,791
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1285
01:23:44,916 --> 01:23:46,960
Sorry's not gonna
dry me off, you cunt.

1286
01:23:47,085 --> 01:23:50,046
Cool down, Franco.
The man says he's sorry.

1287
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:53,383
Not sorry enough
for being a fat cunt.

1288
01:23:53,466 --> 01:23:55,593
If you can't hold a pint,
you shouldn't be in the pub.

1289
01:23:55,718 --> 01:23:56,719
Fuck off.

1290
01:24:01,141 --> 01:24:02,851
Aah.

1291
01:24:02,976 --> 01:24:05,353
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, no!

1292
01:24:12,694 --> 01:24:14,737
Come on, Franco, move away.
Aah!

1293
01:24:14,863 --> 01:24:17,240
Aah!
Fuck's sake!

1294
01:24:17,323 --> 01:24:19,826
Oh, fucking nice one, Franco!

1295
01:24:19,951 --> 01:24:21,619
- Shut it!
- You cut me, man!

1296
01:24:21,703 --> 01:24:23,788
You were in my fucking way.

1297
01:24:23,913 --> 01:24:25,206
Help!

1298
01:24:26,374 --> 01:24:27,709
Oh, no.

1299
01:24:27,834 --> 01:24:31,045
Anybody else want to get
in my fucking way?

1300
01:24:31,171 --> 01:24:32,380
You?

1301
01:24:34,799 --> 01:24:35,925
You?

1302
01:24:40,889 --> 01:24:46,311
Hey, Rent Boy, you bring me down
a fucking smoke.

1303
01:24:46,394 --> 01:24:49,355
- I think we'd better go, Franco!
- Go to the hospital!

1304
01:24:49,481 --> 01:24:53,234
You're not going to any fucking
hospital, and you're staying.

1305
01:24:56,237 --> 01:24:59,365
You bring me down
a fucking cigarette.

1306
01:25:05,163 --> 01:25:06,748

just a minor betrayal.</i>

1346

<i>Or we'd outgrown each other.
You know, that sort of thing.</i>

1347
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:49,262
<i>But let's face it.
I ripped them off.</i>

1348
01:28:49,387 --> 01:28:51,681
<i>My so-called mates.</i>

1349
01:28:51,764 --> 01:28:54,017
<i>But Begbie. I couldn't give
a shit about him.</i>

1350
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,744
<i>And Sick Boy.
He'd have done the same to me</i>

1351
01:28:55,768 --> 01:28:57,604
<i>if he'd only thought
of it first.</i>

1352
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:02,025
<i>And Spud. Well, okay,
I felt sorry for Spud.</i>

1353
01:29:02,108 --> 01:29:03,943
<i>He never hurt anybody.</i>

1354
01:29:10,366 --> 01:29:13,244
Bastard!

1355
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:20,919
Bastard!

1356
01:29:24,088 --> 01:29:26,132
Fuck! Fuck!

1357
01:29:26,257 --> 01:29:27,967
All right, move away, people.

1358
01:29:28,092 --> 01:29:29,928
What's going on in there?

1359
01:29:31,095 --> 01:29:33,681
Open up.
Open up now!

1360
01:29:33,807 --> 01:29:35,558
Bastard!

1361
01:29:36,267 --> 01:29:37,727
Bastard!

1362
01:29:37,852 --> 01:29:40,188
<i>So why did I do it?</i>

1363
01:29:40,855 --> 01:29:43,942
<i>I could offer
a million answers, all false.</i>

1364
01:29:44,025 --> 01:29:46,069
<i>The truth is
that I'm a bad person,</i>

1365
01:29:46,194 --> 01:29:47,612
<i>but that's gonna change.</i>

1366
01:29:47,737 --> 01:29:49,572
<i>I'm going to change.</i>

1367
01:29:49,656 --> 01:29:51,658
<i>This is the last
of that sort of thing.</i>

1368
01:29:51,783 --> 01:29:53,451
<i>I'm cleaning up
and I'm moving on.</i>

1369
01:29:53,535 --> 01:29:55,829
<i>Going straight
and choosing life.</i>

1370
01:29:55,954 --> 01:29:58,164
<i>I'm looking forward to it
