00:01:10,997 --> 00:01:13,898
<i>This is the end</i>

2
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,969
<i>Beautiful friend</i>

3
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>This is the end</i>

4
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:25,869
<i>My only friend</i>

5
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:27,946
<i>The end</i>

6
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:31,813
<i>Of our elaborate plans</i>

7
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:33,886
<i>The end</i>

8
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:37,615
<i>Of everything that stands</i>

9
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,657
<i>The end</i>

10
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,661
<i>No safety nor surprise</i>

11
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:45,754
<i>The end</i>

12
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:51,599
<i>I'll never look into your eyes</i>

13
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:53,729
<i>Again</i>

14
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,740
<i>Can you picture</i>

15
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:03,076
<i>What will be</i>

16
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:08,415
<i>So limitless and free</i>

17
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:12,184
<i>Desperately in need</i>

18
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,191
<i>Of some</i>

19
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:16,921
<i>Stranger's hand</i>

20
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:18,929
<i>In a</i>

21
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:21,431
<i>Desperate land</i>

22
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:13,518
<i>Lost in a Roman</i>

23
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:17,146
<i>Wilderness of pain</i>

24
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:24,856
<i>And all the children</i>

25
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:28,695
<i>Are insane</i>

26
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:35,935
<i>All the children</i>

27
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:39,808
<i>Are insane</i>

28
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:47,651
<i>Waiting for the summer rain</i>

29
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:50,313
<i>Yeah</i>

30
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:18,148
<i>Saigon.</i>

31
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,978
<i>Shit.</i>

32
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:25,990
<i>I'm still only in Saigon.</i>

33
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:38,401
<i>Every time, I think I'm gonna
wake up back in the jungle.</i>

34
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:46,702
<i>When I was home after
my first tour, it was worse.</i>

35
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:58,546
<i>I'd wake up,
and there'd be nothing.</i>

36
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:10,401
<i>I hardly said a word to my wife
until I said yes to a divorce.</i>

37
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:16,230
<i>When I was here,
I wanted to be there.</i>

38
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:22,212
<i>When I was there, all I could think
of was getting back into the jungle.</i>

39
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:27,243
<i>I'm here a week now.</i>

40
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:32,822
<i>Waiting for a mission...</i>

41
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:35,325
<i>getting softer.</i>

42
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:43,490
<i>Every minute I stay
in this room, I get weaker.</i>

43
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:48,505
<i>And every minute Charlie squats
in the bush, he gets stronger.</i>

44
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:57,041
<i>Each time I looked around,
the walls moved in a little tighter.</i>

45
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,057
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah</i>

46
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:18,034
<i>Come on, babe, come on now
Livin' life, yeah</i>

47
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:21,937
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah</i>

48
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,442
<i>Fuck, yeah, come on, baby</i>

49
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:27,944
<i>Fuck, baby, fuck, fuck</i>

50
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:30,345
<i>Oh, yeah, oh, fuck</i>

51
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,440
<i>Yeah, do it, yeah, come on</i>

52
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:37,818
<i>Yeah, all right</i>

53
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:57,639
<i>Yeah</i>

54
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:02,511
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

55
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:05,015
<i>Yeah</i>

56
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:08,814
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

57
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:11,014
<i>Yeah</i>

58
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:39,639
<i>Everyone gets everything he wants.</i>

59
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:42,482
<i>I wanted a mission...</i>

60
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:46,388
<i>and for my sins,
they gave me one.</i>

61
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:48,926
<i>Brought it up to me
like room service.</i>

62
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:52,691
Captain Willard?
Are you in there?

63
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:54,857
Yeah, I'm comin'.

64
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:57,800
<i>It was a real choice mission.</i>

65
00:07:57,903 --> 00:08:02,237
<i>And when it was over,
I'd never want another.</i>

66
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:13,045
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?

67
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:16,053
What does it look like?

68
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:27,061
- Are you Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.

69
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,066
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:33,696
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door?

71
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:38,402
We have orders to escort you
to the airfield.

72
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:41,911
- What are the charges?
- Sir?

73
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:45,347
- What'd I do?
- There's no charges, Captain.

74
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:49,251
You have orders to report to
Com-Sec Intelligence at Nha Trang.

75
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:52,256
- I see.
- All right?

76
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:55,350
- Nha Trang, for me?
- That's right.

77
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:58,862
Come on, Captain. You still have
a few hours to get cleaned up.

78
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:02,991
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?

79
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:06,299
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

80
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:09,431
Come on, Captain.
Let's take a shower.

81
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,668
- Don't be an ass.
- Get a hold of him good.

82
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:14,007
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.
In we go.

83
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:17,605
Stand underneath this, Captain.

84
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,127
<i>I was going to the worst place
in the world...</i>

85
00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:33,027
<i>and I didn't even know it yet.</i>

86
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:36,067
<i>Weeks away and hundreds
of miles up a river...</i>

87
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:39,365
<i>that snaked through the war
like a main circuit cable...</i>

88
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:42,133
<i>plugged straight into Kurtz.</i>

89
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:47,073
<i>It was no accident that
I got to be the caretaker...</i>

90
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:49,909
<i>of Colonel
Walter E. Kurtz's memory-</i>

91
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:54,782
<i>any more than being back
in Saigon was an accident.</i>

92
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:58,755
<i>There is no way to tell his story
without telling my own.</i>

93
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:01,451
<i>If his story
is really a confession-</i>

94
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,085
<i>- Captain Willard reporting, sir.
- then so is mine.</i>

95
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:07,393
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

96
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:11,435
- Stand at ease.
- General.

97
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:15,132
You want a cigarette?

98
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,765
No, thank you, sir.

99
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:22,313
- Have you ever seen this man before?
- No, sir.

100
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,144
- Met the general or myself?
- No, sir.

101
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,741
Not personally.

102
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:31,584
- You've worked a lot on your own?
- Yes, sir, I have.

103
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,157
Your report
specifies intelligence...

104
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,657
counterintelligence
with Com-Sec, "I" Corps.

105
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,856
I'm not presently disposed to
discuss those operations, sir.

106
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,530
Did you not work for
the CIA in "I" Corps?

107
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:53,143
No, sir.

108
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:55,975
Did you not assassinate
a government tax collector...

109
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:58,845
Quang Tri Province,
June 18, 1968?

110
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,853
Captain?

111
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:09,725
Sir, I am unaware of any
such activity or operation-

112
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:14,993
nor would I be disposed to
discuss such an operation...

113
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,763
if it did,
in fact, exist, sir.

114
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:32,045
I thought we'd have
a bite of lunch while we talk.

115
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,950
I hope you brought
a good appetite, Captain.

116
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:40,991
I notice that you have
a bad hand there. You wounded?

117
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:43,425
I had a little fishing accident
on R and R, sir.

118
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,124
- Fishing on R and R?
- Yes, sir.

119
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:49,632
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

120
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:52,203
Yes, General.
Very much so, sir.

121
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:57,833
Well, let's see what we have here,
roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

122
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:02,372
Try some, Jerry,
and pass it around.

123
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:06,542
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

124
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:11,919
Captain, I don't know how
you feel about this shrimp...

125
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,924
but if you'll eat it...

126
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:18,656
you'll never have to prove
your courage in any other way.

127
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:22,700
I swear, why don't I
just take a piece here?

128
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:27,101
Captain, you've heard of
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

129
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:31,301
Yes, sir,
I've heard the name.

130
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,278
Oh, Jesus! Operations officer,
Fifth Special Forces.

131
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,941
Luke, would you play that tape
for the captain, please?

132
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,542
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.

133
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:47,049
<i>October 9, 0430 hours,
sector Peter, Victor, King.</i>

134
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,322
These were monitored
out of Cambodia.

135
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:53,159
This has been verified
as Col. Kurtz's voice.

136
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:57,361
<i>I watched a snail...</i>

137
00:12:57,469 --> 00:13:01,838
<i>crawl along the edge
of a straight razor.</i>

138
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:06,376
<i>That's my dream.</i>

139
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:10,607
<i>That's my nightmare.</i>

140
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,947
<i>Crawling, slithering...</i>

141
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:18,216
<i>along the edge...</i>

142
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:22,453
<i>of a straight razor...</i>

143
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:25,924
<i>and surviving.</i>

<i>Transmission 11, received

<i>Sector King, Zulu, King.</i>

146
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:38,575
<i>But we must kill them.</i>

147
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:41,237
<i>We must incinerate them.</i>

148
00:13:41,346 --> 00:13:43,746
<i>Pig after pig.</i>

149
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:45,783
<i>Cow after cow.</i>

150
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:52,122
<i>Village after village.
Army after army.</i>

151
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:55,125
<i>And they call me an assassin.</i>

152
00:13:55,227 --> 00:14:00,688
<i>What do you call it when
the assassins accuse the assassin?</i>

153
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,668
<i>They lie. They lie,
and we have to be merciful...</i>

154
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:08,001
<i>for those who lie.</i>

155
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:10,904
<i>Those nabobs.</i>

156
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,135
<i>I hate them.</i>

157
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:18,642
<i>I do hate them.</i>

158
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:26,416
Walt Kurtz was one of
the most outstanding officers...

159
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:28,652
this country's ever produced.

160
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,856
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.

161
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:38,630
And he was a good man, too,
a humanitarian man.

162
00:14:38,737 --> 00:14:41,763
A man of wit and humor.

163
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:45,866
He joined the Special Forces.

164
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:49,708
And after that his...

165
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:52,909
ideas, methods...

166
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,688
became...

167
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:01,084
unsound.

168
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,597
Unsound.

169
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,431
Now he's crossed
into Cambodia with this...

170
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,805
Montagnard army of his
that worship...

171
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,606
the man like a god...

172
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:26,616
and follow every order,
however ridiculous.

173
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:30,882
Well, I have some other
shocking news to tell you.

174
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:36,552
Col. Kurtz was about
to be arrested for murder.

175
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:40,563
I don't follow, sir.
Murdered who?

176
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:44,658
Kurtz had ordered the execution of
some Vietnamese intelligence agents-

177
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,729
men he believed
were double agents.

178
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,005
So he took matters
into his own hands.

179
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:56,740
Well, you see, Willard...

180
00:15:56,848 --> 00:16:02,480
in this war, things
get confused out there.

181
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:06,421
Power, ideals,
the old morality...

182
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:09,358
and practical
military necessity.

183
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:14,856
But out there
with these natives...

184
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:19,665
it must be a temptation to...

185
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,171
be God.

186
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:28,776
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart...

187
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,475
between the rational
and the irrational...

188
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:35,883
between good and evil...

189
00:16:35,987 --> 00:16:38,956
and good does not
always triumph.

190
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:43,994
Sometimes...

191
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:46,256
the dark side...

192
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:51,165
overcomes what Lincoln called
the better angels of our nature.

193
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:55,095
Every man has got
a breaking point.

194
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:58,370
You and I have them.

195
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,378
Walt Kurtz has reached his.

196
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:07,144
And very obviously,
he has gone insane.

197
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:23,298
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

198
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:31,398
Your mission is to proceed up the
Nung River in a navy patrol boat-

199
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,503
pick up Col. Kurtz's path
at Nu Mung Ba...

200
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:39,778
follow it, learn what
you can along the way.

201
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:43,218
When you find the colonel,
infiltrate his team by-

202
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:48,190
whatever means available and
terminate the colonel's command.

203
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:57,197
Terminate the colonel?

204
00:17:57,302 --> 00:18:02,399
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint...

205
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:06,534
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable...

206
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:08,613
human conduct...

207
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:12,911
and he is still on the field,
commanding troops.

208
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:16,476
Terminate with
extreme prejudice.

209
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,384
You understand, Captain,
that this mission...

210
00:18:20,492 --> 00:18:25,020
does not exist
nor will it ever exist.

211
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:24,218
<i>How many people
had I already killed?</i>

212
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:28,122
<i>There were those six
that I knew about for sure-</i>

213
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:32,629
<i>close enough to blow
their last breath in my face.</i>

214
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:37,429
<i>But this time
it was an American...</i>

215
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:39,560
<i>and an officer.</i>

216
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:53,209
<i>That wasn't supposed to make
any difference to me...</i>

217
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,343
<i>but it did.</i>

218
00:19:57,122 --> 00:20:00,558
<i>Shit. Charging a man
with murder in this place...</i>

219
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:06,221
<i>was like handing out
speeding tickets at the Indy 500.</i>

220
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:10,734
<i>I took the mission.
What the hell else was I gonna do?</i>

221
00:20:12,404 --> 00:20:16,306
<i>But I really didn't know
what I'd do when I found him.</i>

222
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:26,311
- Did you check the tank?
- Yeah.

223
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,556
<i>I was being ferried down
the coast in a navy PBR...</i>

224
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:36,650
<i>a type of plastic patrol boat-
a pretty common sight on the rivers.</i>

225
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:39,662
<i>They said it was a good way to
pick up information and move...</i>

226
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:43,996
<i>without drawing a lot
of attention, and that was okay.</i>

227
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:47,094
<i>I needed the air and the time.</i>

228
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,537
<i>Only problem was
I wouldn't be alone.</i>

229
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:51,700
Mornin', Captain.

230
00:20:53,912 --> 00:20:57,075
<i>The crew were
mostly just kids-</i>

231
00:20:57,182 --> 00:21:01,118
<i>rock and rollers with
one foot in their graves.</i>

232
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,814
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

233
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:08,381
<i>The machinist- the one they
called Chef- was from New Orleans.</i>

234
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:11,394
<i>He was wrapped too tight
for Vietnam.</i>

235
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:14,226
<i>Probably wrapped too tight
for New Orleans.</i>

236
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:16,266
<i>Lance, on the forward fifties...</i>

237
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:19,097
<i>was a famous surfer
from the beaches south of L. A.</i>

238
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:23,038
<i>To look at him, you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.</i>

239
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:29,107
<i>Clean- Mr. Clean- was
from some South Bronx shit-hole...</i>

240
00:21:29,214 --> 00:21:31,375
<i>and I think the light
and the space of Vietnam...</i>

241
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:35,078
<i>really put the zap on his head.</i>

242
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:39,116
<i>Then there was Phillips,
the chief.</i>

243
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:43,160
<i>It might have been my mission, but
it sure as shit was the chief's boat.</i>

244
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,195
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water...

245
00:21:45,296 --> 00:21:47,696
to get into the Nung River.

246
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,963
They're both hot.
Belong to Charlie.

247
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,470
Don't worry about it.

248
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:57,666
Don't smoke.

249
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,938
You know, I've pulled
a few special ops in here.

250
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:03,639
About six months ago...

251
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:08,048
I took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Lung.

252
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:10,849
He was regular army too.

253
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:16,293
Heard he shot himself
in the head.

254
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:28,104
<i>At first I thought
they handed me the wrong dossier.</i>

255
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:30,766
<i>I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead.</i>

256
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,311
<i>Third-generation West Point,
top of his class.</i>

257
00:22:35,413 --> 00:22:39,645
<i>Korea, Airborne,
about a thousand decorations.</i>

258
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:41,742
<i>Et cetera, et cetera.</i>

259
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:49,259
<i>I'd heard his voice on the tape,
and it really put the hook in me...</i>

260
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,956
<i>but I couldn't connect up
that voice with this man.</i>

261
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:03,939
<i>Like they said,
he had an impressive career.</i>

262
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:08,945
<i>Maybe too impressive.
I mean, perfect.</i>

263
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:13,279
<i>He was being groomed for one of
the top slots in the corporation-</i>

264
00:23:13,384 --> 00:23:16,683
<i>general, chief of staff,
anything.</i>

265
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:22,416
<i>In 1964, he returned from a tour
with Advisory Command in Vietnam...</i>

266
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,893
<i>and things started to slip.</i>

267
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:27,089
<i>His report to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff...</i>

268
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,632
<i>and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.</i>

269
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:35,102
<i>Seems they didn't dig
what he had to tell them.</i>

270
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:38,141
<i>During the next few months, he
made three requests for transfer...</i>

271
00:23:38,243 --> 00:23:43,306
<i>to Airborne training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted.</i>

272
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,450
<i>Airborne?</i>

273
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,050
<i>He was 38 years old.</i>

274
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:56,422
<i>Why the fuck would he do that?</i>

275
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:03,029
<i>1966, joins Special Forces...</i>

276
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:05,159
<i>returns to Vietnam.</i>

277
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:07,427
Hey, what's that?

278
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:10,029
- Arc light.
- What's up?

279
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:12,701
- B-52 strike.
- Yeah?

280
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,710
- What's that?
- Arc light.

281
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:17,781
I hate that. Every time I hear that,
something terrible happens.

282
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:19,782
Charlie don't never
see 'em or hear 'em, man.

283
00:24:19,884 --> 00:24:21,112
There they are.

284
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:23,517
Concussion will suck the air
out of your damn lungs.

285
00:24:23,621 --> 00:24:25,646
Something terrible
is gonna happen.

286
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:29,386
Smoke! Secondary burning.

287
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:32,019
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

288
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,031
Let's have a look, Chief.

289
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:38,728
<i>It was the Air-Cav.
First of the Ninth-</i>

290
00:24:38,836 --> 00:24:39,666
That's them.

291
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,672
<i>our escorts to the mouth
of the Nung River.</i>

292
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:46,642
<i>But they were supposed to be waiting
for us another 30 kilometers ahead.</i>

293
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:51,909
<i>Well, Air Mobile.
Those boys just couldn't stay put.</i>

294
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:06,563
Hey, kid, come on.
Get down. Come on.

295
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:20,509
<i>First of the Ninth was
an old cavalry division...</i>

296
00:25:20,611 --> 00:25:22,511
<i>that had cashed in its horses
for choppers...</i>

297
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:26,515
<i>and gone tear-assing around
'Nam looking for the shit.</i>

298
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:31,179
<i>They'd given Charlie
a few surprises in their time here.</i>

299
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:36,124
<i>What they were mopping up now hadn't
even happened yet an hour ago.</i>

300
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:38,525
Just keeping running by.
We're for television.

301
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:40,927
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep- Go on. Keep going.

302
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:42,932
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

303
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:46,333
Just go by like you're fighting,
like you're fighting.

304
00:25:46,437 --> 00:25:49,964
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television. Just go through.

305
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:52,065
Just go by. Keep on going.

306
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,303
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.

307
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:56,277
All right, come on. Go.

308
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,320
Right here. Yes.
Over here. Over here.

309
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,701
Where can I find the CO?

310
00:26:19,804 --> 00:26:23,968
That's the colonel comin' down!

311
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,878
The CO's on that chopper.

312
00:26:57,141 --> 00:27:00,668
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line
back about 100 yards!

313
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:03,906
- Give me some room to breathe!
- Yes, sir!

314
00:27:08,653 --> 00:27:09,915
Body cards!

315
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:12,046
- Sir?
- Bring my body cards!

316
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:14,056
Yes, sir!

317
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:19,892
I'm the Fourth Tank commander.
I got five tanks broken down.

318
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:23,160
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

319
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,529
Captain Willard!

320
00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:28,036
I carry priority papers from
Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.

321
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:30,073
I understand Nha Trang
has briefed you...

322
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:32,074
on the requirements of my mission.

323
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:34,770
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.

324
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:37,814
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

325
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:40,076
- We'll see what we can do.
- Colonel!

326
00:27:40,184 --> 00:27:44,951
But just stay out of my way
until this is done, Captain.

327
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:50,225
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

328
00:27:50,328 --> 00:27:55,391
A two of spades, three of spades,
four of diamonds...

329
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,128
six of clubs, eight of spades.

330
00:27:58,236 --> 00:28:01,262
There isn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch.

331
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:04,307
Four of diamonds.

332
00:28:04,408 --> 00:28:08,139
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death cards!

333
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:11,545
- What?
- Death cards!

334
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,981
- Death?
- Lets Charlie know who did this.

335
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:20,388
<i>- Cheer up, son.
- We will not hurt or harm you.</i>

336
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:24,257
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

337
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,987
<i>This is an area
that is controlled...</i>

338
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:30,499
<i>by the Vietcong
and North Vietnamese.</i>

339
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:32,501
Jim.

340
00:28:36,574 --> 00:28:39,805
<i>We are here to help you.</i>

341
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:44,904
<i>- We extend a welcome hand...
- Come on.</i>

342
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:47,075
<i>- to those who would like to return...
- Everybody in?</i>

343
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:51,518
<i>to the arms of
the South Vietnamese government.</i>

344
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:55,023
Get in. Hurry up.

345
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:57,822
Move it out.

346
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:00,454
<i>This is an area
that is controlled...</i>

347
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:03,159
<i>by the Vietcong
and North Vietnamese.</i>

348
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:08,432
Hey! What's this?
What is this?

349
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,235
This man's hurt
pretty bad, sir.

350
00:29:11,342 --> 00:29:14,778
About the only thing that's holding
his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.

351
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,279
Yeah? What do you have to say?

352
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:23,217
This soldier is dirty VC. He wants
water. He can drink paddy water.

353
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:26,722
Get outta here!
Give me that canteen.

354
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:29,952
- He's VC!
- Any man that's brave enough to-

355
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:32,655
Get outta here!
I'll kick your fuckin' ass!

356
00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:34,890
He killed a lot of our people!

357
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:37,092
Any man brave enough
to fight with his guts...

358
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:39,192
strapped on him
can drink from my canteen.

359
00:29:39,303 --> 00:29:43,364
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those
sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

360
00:29:43,474 --> 00:29:47,308
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.

361
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,402
Yeah? Here.

362
00:29:49,513 --> 00:29:52,414
Repeat. We have a body count.
We have-

363
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:57,145
What's your name, sailor?

364
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:00,087
- Gunner's Mate Third Class Johnson.
- Gunner's Mate Third Class-

365
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:04,287
- Lance Johnson, the surfer?
- Yes, sir.

366
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:08,525
It's an honor to meet you. I've
admired your nose riding for years.

367
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:11,500
I like your cutback too. I think
you have the best cutback there is.

368
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:14,264
- Thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap.

369
00:30:14,372 --> 00:30:16,363
I'm Bill Kilgore.
I'm a goofy foot.

370
00:30:16,474 --> 00:30:18,374
- This guy with ya?
- Yeah.

371
00:30:18,476 --> 00:30:20,307
I want you to meet some guys.

372
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:22,311
- This is Mike from San Diego.
- Far out.

373
00:30:22,413 --> 00:30:25,280
- Johnny from Malibu. Solid surfers.
- John, hi. Far out.

374
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:27,510
None of us are anywhere
near your class though.

375
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,051
No way.

376
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:33,055
We do a lot of surfing around here.
I like to finish operations early.

377
00:30:33,157 --> 00:30:35,523
Fly down to Yung Tau
for the evening glass.

378
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,060
Been riding since you got here?

379
00:30:38,162 --> 00:30:40,756
No way. I haven't surfed
since I been here.

380
00:30:40,865 --> 00:30:43,265
Through Christ, our Lord...

381
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:45,460
from Whom
all good things come...

382
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:48,129
through Him in the unity
of the Holy Spirit.

383
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:51,106
All glory and honor
is Yours, Almighty Father.

384
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:53,676
Let us bring
our iniquities to the Father...

385
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:55,712
in the words our Savior gave us.

386
00:30:55,813 --> 00:31:00,750
Our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

387
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:05,515
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

388
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:08,421
Give us this day
our daily bread...

389
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:10,426
and forgive us our trespasses...

390
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:12,655
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

391
00:31:12,763 --> 00:31:16,392
<i>Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.</i>

392
00:31:25,443 --> 00:31:29,209
<i>Kilgore had had a pretty
good day for himself.</i>

393
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:31,440
<i>They choppered in
the T-bones and the beer...</i>

394
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:34,848
<i>and turned the LZ
into a beach party.</i>

395
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:37,921
<i>The more they tried
to make it just like home...</i>

396
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,650
<i>the more they made
everybody miss it.</i>

397
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:43,955
Make my meat rare-
rare but not cold.

398
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:53,198
<i>Well, he wasn't
a bad officer, I guess.</i>

399
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:56,796
<i>He loved his boys,
and you felt safe with him.</i>

400
00:31:56,907 --> 00:32:00,206
<i>He was one of those guys that
had that weird light around him.</i>

401
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:04,077
<i>You just knew he wasn't gonna
get so much as a scratch here.</i>

402
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:08,049
What happened to your mission?
Nha Trang forget all about you?

403
00:32:16,093 --> 00:32:19,153
Airborne.

404
00:32:19,263 --> 00:32:22,755
Sir, two places we can
get into the river.

405
00:32:22,867 --> 00:32:25,859
- Yeah.
- Here and here.

406
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,839
It's a pretty wide delta, but these
are the only two spots I'm sure of.

407
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:33,967
That village you're pointing at
is kind of hairy.

408
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:36,410
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy.

409
00:32:36,514 --> 00:32:38,414
Got some pretty heavy ordnance.

410
00:32:38,516 --> 00:32:40,882
I lost a few recon ships
in there now and again.

411
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:44,216
What's the name of
that goddamn village? Vin Drin-

412
00:32:44,321 --> 00:32:46,687
- Dop.
- Dop or Lop?

413
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:50,420
Damn gook names
all sound the same.

414
00:32:50,528 --> 00:32:53,520
Mike, you know anything about
this point at Vin Drin Dop?

415
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:55,531
That's a fantastic peak.

416
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:58,067
- Peak?
- About six foot.

417
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:01,866
It's an outstanding peak. It's got
both the long right and left slide...

418
00:33:01,972 --> 00:33:04,167
with a bowl section
that's unbelievable.

419
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:06,675
It's just tube city.

420
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,914
Why didn't you tell me
that before? A good peak.

421
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:14,712
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

422
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:16,719
It's all goddamn beach break.

423
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:19,756
It's really hairy in there.
That's where we lost McDonald.

424
00:33:19,857 --> 00:33:24,089
They shot the hell out of us there.
That's Charlie's point.

425
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:26,629
Sir, we can go in there
tomorrow at dawn.

426
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,789
There's always a good
offshore breeze in the morning.

427
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:30,799
We may not be able
to get the boat in.

428
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:34,894
The draft at the mouth of
that river may be too shallow.

429
00:33:35,005 --> 00:33:37,974
We'll pick your boat up and put it
down like a baby where you want it.

430
00:33:38,075 --> 00:33:40,566
This is the First of the Ninth,
Air-Cav, son.

431
00:33:40,678 --> 00:33:45,012
Air mobile! I can take that point
and hold it as long as I like.

432
00:33:45,115 --> 00:33:48,141
You can get anyplace up that river
that suits you, young Captain.

433
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:50,652
Hell, a six-foot peak.

434
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:53,823
Take a gunship
back to the division.

435
00:33:53,924 --> 00:33:55,983
Lance, go with Mike and let him
pick out a board for you.

436
00:33:56,093 --> 00:33:58,254
Bring me my Yater Spoon,
the eight-six.

437
00:33:58,362 --> 00:34:00,262
- I don't know, sir-
- What is it, soldier?

438
00:34:00,364 --> 00:34:03,424
It's hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.

439
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,661
Charlie don't surf!

440
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:32,751
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't
gonna believe this. Look.

441
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,765
Hey, man!
They're pickin' up the boat!

442
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:43,872
- How are you feeling, Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

443
00:34:45,509 --> 00:34:47,477
All right, son, let 'er rip.

444
00:34:47,578 --> 00:34:50,342
Let's go!

445
00:36:12,763 --> 00:36:16,563
I never have got used to a light
board. I can't get used to one.

446
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:19,568
- I'm used to a heavy board.
- I know, it's a real drag.

447
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,298
- You prefer a heavy or light board?
- Heavier.

448
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:24,306
- Really?
- Yeah!

449
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:27,070
I thought all the young guys
like lighter boards.

450
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:30,271
<i>- You can't ride the nose on those.
- Big Duke Six.</i>

451
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:32,042
This is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.

452
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,707
<i>Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.</i>

453
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,253
Put on heading two-seven-zero.
Assume attack formation.

454
00:36:37,354 --> 00:36:39,720
<i>That's a roger, Big Duke.
We're going in.</i>

455
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:43,884
Hey, Lance, we'll come in
low out of the rising sun.

456
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,462
About a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

457
00:36:46,563 --> 00:36:48,929
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.

458
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:53,163
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.

459
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,602
Hey, they're gonna play music!

460
00:37:02,112 --> 00:37:05,809
How come all you guys
sit on your helmet?

461
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:09,215
So we don't get
our balls blown off.

462
00:37:19,263 --> 00:37:23,700
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.
Put on psy war op.

463
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:28,465
Make it loud. This is a Romeo
Fox Trot. Shall we dance?

464
00:37:33,243 --> 00:37:35,973
Yes, sir!

465
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,115
- Come on!
- All right. Fire.

466
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:09,624
<i>We got a couple-
at that tree line.</i>

467
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:12,668
<i>We're taking fire from the holes.</i>

468
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:16,098
Run, Charlie!

469
00:40:18,408 --> 00:40:22,344
<i>This should make
everything burn.</i>

470
00:40:32,155 --> 00:40:35,386
<i>We got a couple
of people ahead here.</i>

471
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:38,859
<i>- What's going down here?
- We got an automatic! Shoot to kill!</i>

472
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:42,523
<i>- Shoot to kill in the open!
- I spotted a large weapon down below.</i>

473
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:45,067
We're gonna go down
and check it out.

474
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:47,500
<i>All right, this is Fox Trot.
We're pullin' in.</i>

475
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,977
What a shot.

476
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,880
Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.
Get you a case of beer for that.

477
00:41:23,674 --> 00:41:26,234
<i>Six-four-one-zero,
we're over the village right now.</i>

478
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:29,210
I see a vehicle in the courtyard.
I'm gonna check it out.

479
00:41:29,313 --> 00:41:31,645
Well done, Hawks.

480
00:41:31,748 --> 00:41:34,376
Want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan
along those tree lines.

481
00:41:34,484 --> 00:41:36,418
Ripple the shit out of 'em.

482
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,114
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
50 caliber on board.

483
00:41:39,222 --> 00:41:42,350
He's moving across
to resupply the weapon.

484
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,690
<i>Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down myself.</i>

485
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:47,593
Don't these people ever give up?

486
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,426
Nice shot, Bill.

487
00:41:53,537 --> 00:41:57,200
- Shit!
- All right, all right!

488
00:41:57,307 --> 00:42:01,744
- It's just a flare!
- It's a flare! Gotta get outta here!

489
00:42:01,845 --> 00:42:04,075
Un-ass that shit.
Get it outta here!

490
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:08,208
Get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right.

491
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:11,446
- Everybody all right? Lance?
- I'm fine!

492
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:28,403
Get down!

493
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:52,093
I'm not going!
I'm not going! I'm not going.

494
00:43:07,277 --> 00:43:09,404
<i>We just got a secondary
down there in the plaza.</i>

495
00:43:09,513 --> 00:43:11,606
<i>Hold on to your position.</i>

496
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:14,843
<i>Duke Six, we've got
wounded down there.</i>

497
00:43:23,794 --> 00:43:26,285
- Get a stretcher over here!
- You're all right.

498
00:43:30,934 --> 00:43:35,962
- Please, God! Help me!
- Give him some morphine.

499
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,404
My God! Oh!

500
00:43:38,508 --> 00:43:41,739
- Seven-four-two!
- Where's that duster?

501
00:43:41,845 --> 00:43:44,507
I want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 15 minutes.

502
00:43:44,614 --> 00:43:46,548
I want my men out.

503
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,777
<i>Somebody stay in there
tight with Big Duke.</i>

504
00:43:48,885 --> 00:43:53,117
<i>This is Ten-Ten. We're gonna be in,
throw 'em on and get out.</i>

505
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:15,434
She's got a grenade!

506
00:44:15,545 --> 00:44:16,978
She's got a grenade!

507
00:44:20,183 --> 00:44:21,946
The whole thing blew up.

508
00:44:22,052 --> 00:44:23,815
<i>- She blew the shit-
- Fucking savages.</i>

509
00:44:26,423 --> 00:44:28,414
<i>- Get a medevac.
- Holy Christ, she's a SAP.</i>

510
00:44:28,525 --> 00:44:30,220
<i>I'm gonna get
that dink bitch.</i>

511
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:33,592
<i>Get over there, Johnny. Roll
that right skid right up her ass.</i>

512
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:37,628
We gotta get some air
in these trees.

513
00:44:37,734 --> 00:44:40,066
It's goddamn eat-up
with enemy down here.

514
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,229
<i>I'm taking fire.
I'm taking hits all over.</i>

515
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:44,637
Three o'clock!
I'm drawing heavy fire!

516
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:47,107
<i>I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm goin' in.</i>

517
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,677
<i>My tail rotor's out.
I got control.</i>

518
00:44:57,554 --> 00:45:00,523
- What do you think?
- Wow! This is really exciting, man.

519
00:45:00,624 --> 00:45:03,855
- No! No! The waves! The waves!
- Oh, right.

520
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,657
Look at that.
Breaks both ways. Watch. Watch.

521
00:45:07,764 --> 00:45:10,665
<i>Look! Good six-foot swells!</i>

522
00:45:33,723 --> 00:45:35,623
Come here, Lance.

523
00:45:39,262 --> 00:45:41,162
Incoming!

524
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,859
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.

525
00:45:45,969 --> 00:45:47,903
Maybe you ought to surf
somewhere else.

526
00:45:48,004 --> 00:45:49,403
What do you know
about surfing, Major?

527
00:45:49,506 --> 00:45:52,202
You're from goddamn New Jersey.

528
00:45:53,643 --> 00:45:56,578
Come here! Come here!

529
00:45:58,782 --> 00:46:01,307
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?

530
00:46:01,418 --> 00:46:04,251
I wanna see how rideable
that stuff is. Go change.

531
00:46:04,354 --> 00:46:06,254
It's still pretty hairy
out there.

532
00:46:06,356 --> 00:46:08,324
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

533
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:10,950
That's good, son,
'cause you either surf or fight.

534
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:14,792
That clear? Get going.
I'll cover for 'em.

535
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:17,958
And bring a board for Lance.

536
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,400
We can't do shit
until the boat gets here.

537
00:46:20,503 --> 00:46:23,836
Lance, I'll bet you can't
wait to get out there.

538
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,908
- What?
- See how they break both ways?

539
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:29,968
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think?

540
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,105
We ought to wait
for the tide to come up.

541
00:46:32,215 --> 00:46:35,207
- Come here. Look.
- Incoming!

542
00:46:37,721 --> 00:46:42,215
The tide doesn't come in
for six hours!

543
00:46:42,325 --> 00:46:45,419
You wanna wait here
for six hours?

544
00:46:47,464 --> 00:46:51,366
Yo! Chief! Chief!

545
00:46:58,008 --> 00:47:01,603
<i>Okay, fellas, quit hiding.
Come on! Let's go!</i>

546
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:04,441
<i>- Dick-heads, take off!
- Goddamn it!</i>

547
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:07,038
Don't you think it's
a little risky for R and R?

548
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:11,211
If I say it's safe to surf this
beach, it's safe to surf this beach!

549
00:47:11,321 --> 00:47:13,585
I'm not afraid
to surf this place!

550
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:16,591
I'll surf this fuckin' place.

551
00:47:18,595 --> 00:47:21,063
Give me that R-T, soldier.

552
00:47:22,332 --> 00:47:25,426
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.
Goddamn it!

553
00:47:25,535 --> 00:47:27,662
<i>I want that tree line bombed!</i>

554
00:47:27,771 --> 00:47:30,239
<i>Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by.</i>

555
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,274
<i>Blow them into the Stone Age, son!</i>

556
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:35,443
- Out!
- No, back, no!

557
00:47:35,545 --> 00:47:39,242
Let me take care of this.
Get that out of here!

558
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:42,841
- I'm sorry.
- Come here now. All right.

559
00:47:42,952 --> 00:47:45,045
- No, ma'am. Sorry!
- Jimmy!

560
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:47,123
<i>Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three.</i>

561
00:47:47,223 --> 00:47:50,681
<i>They need some napalm in the tree
line. Can you put it down there?</i>

562
00:47:50,794 --> 00:47:53,763
<i>Right, One-Three. We're fixin'
to fuck with 'em. What's the target?</i>

563
00:47:53,863 --> 00:47:57,094
<i>We're trying to suppress some mortar
fire off the tree line down there.</i>

564
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,361
<i>- Roger. Here we come.
- Good. Give it all you got.</i>

565
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:01,994
<i>Bring in all your ships.</i>

566
00:48:02,105 --> 00:48:05,871
Put him in my chopper.
Get him back to the hospital.

567
00:48:05,975 --> 00:48:08,205
No, no, no,
you got to go with him.

568
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:11,178
Come on! Go! Go!
Get it outta here!

569
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:13,181
Tell my guys I want my board!

570
00:48:13,283 --> 00:48:15,183
<i>Big Duke Six,
this is Dove One-Three.</i>

571
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:18,652
<i>The jets are inbound now. You got
about 30 seconds to bomb station.</i>

572
00:48:18,755 --> 00:48:21,849
<i>Get your people back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one.</i>

573
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:25,318
Don't worry.

574
00:48:25,428 --> 00:48:29,592
We'll have this place cleaned up
in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry.

575
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:33,135
Give me those shorts.

576
00:48:33,236 --> 00:48:36,967
These are from the Air-Cav,
a present from me and the boys.

577
00:48:37,073 --> 00:48:40,372
I want to see you do your stuff
in 'em out there.

578
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:05,960
You smell that?

579
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:08,663
- Do you smell that?
- What?

580
00:49:08,772 --> 00:49:13,903
Napalm, son. Nothing else
in the world smells like that.

581
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:17,776
Come on. Move it!
Move it! Move it!

582
00:49:17,881 --> 00:49:20,748
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning.

583
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:23,478
You know, one time we had
a hill bombed for 12 hours.

584
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:26,919
When it was all over,
I walked up.

585
00:49:27,023 --> 00:49:32,325
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

586
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,488
But the smell-
You know, that gasoline smell.

587
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:39,864
The whole hill smelled like...

588
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,103
victory.

589
00:49:49,345 --> 00:49:52,280
Someday this war's gonna end.

590
00:50:06,196 --> 00:50:08,790
- Lance! The wind!
- Huh?

591
00:50:08,898 --> 00:50:10,832
- The wind!
- What?

592
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:13,994
It's blowin' onshore!
It's gonna blow this place out.

593
00:50:14,103 --> 00:50:17,231
- It's gonna ruin it!
- Not cool! It's gonna blow out!

594
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,309
It's the goddamn napalm!
That's what's doin' it!

595
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:23,311
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel.
I'm afraid that does it.

596
00:50:23,413 --> 00:50:24,641
The kid's got a reputation.

597
00:50:24,747 --> 00:50:27,113
You can't expect him
to surf those sloppy waves.

598
00:50:27,217 --> 00:50:29,447
- I understand.
- I'm an artist, Bill.

599
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:34,580
- I couldn't surf that stuff.
- I apologize. It's not my fault.

600
00:50:34,691 --> 00:50:36,181
The waves are gettin'
blown out by the napalm.

601
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:37,350
Don't get me wrong-

602
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,451
It was the bombs causing
a vortex with the wind.

603
00:50:39,562 --> 00:50:41,462
I accept your apology.

604
00:50:41,564 --> 00:50:44,260
But if you could hang
around 20 minutes-

605
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:46,699
- Some other time, Bill.
- Just 20 minutes!

606
00:50:46,803 --> 00:50:50,034
- I'm an artist.
- Keep walking.

607
00:50:50,139 --> 00:50:54,132
<i>Okay, give it a try, guys.
One goes left and one goes right.</i>

608
00:50:54,244 --> 00:50:56,144
<i>Look, Lance.</i>

609
00:50:56,246 --> 00:50:58,146
- You through surfing?
- Yeah!

610
00:50:58,248 --> 00:51:00,182
- Wanna say good-bye to the colonel?
- No.

611
00:51:00,283 --> 00:51:02,183
- You sure?
- Yeah!

612
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:04,617
<i>- Get the fuck outta here.
- It's the napalm.</i>

613
00:51:04,721 --> 00:51:06,985
<i>Just wait 20 minutes!</i>

614
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:09,251
Damn! Fuck!

615
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,192
They've been lookin' for ya.

616
00:51:13,563 --> 00:51:16,498
- Don't leave without me!
- Where the fuck you goin'?

617
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:19,295
Here!

618
00:51:21,004 --> 00:51:23,666
Incoming!

619
00:51:23,773 --> 00:51:25,741
That's the colonel's surfboard!

620
00:51:25,842 --> 00:51:28,174
Hey, get the fuck off me!
It's mine!

621
00:51:36,486 --> 00:51:39,011
You fucking Airborne!

622
00:52:10,386 --> 00:52:12,581
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.

623
00:52:12,689 --> 00:52:14,247
Come on. Let's get high.

624
00:52:14,357 --> 00:52:16,325
- Wanna smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.

625
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:19,862
<i>Someday this war's gonna end.</i>

626
00:52:19,963 --> 00:52:22,864
<i>That would be just fine
with the boys on the boat.</i>

627
00:52:22,966 --> 00:52:25,298
<i>They weren't looking for
anything more than a way home.</i>

628
00:52:25,401 --> 00:52:30,361
<i>- Captain?
- Trouble is, I'd been back there...</i>

629
00:52:30,473 --> 00:52:33,533
<i>and I knew that it just
didn't exist anymore.</i>

630
00:52:35,979 --> 00:52:39,005
Buddha time. Here.

631
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:43,245
All right, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

632
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,453
<i>If that's how Kilgore
fought the war...</i>

633
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,428
<i>I began to wonder what
they really had against Kurtz.</i>

634
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,431
<i>It wasn't just
insanity and murder.</i>

635
00:52:57,533 --> 00:53:00,593
<i>There was enough of that
to go around for everyone.</i>

636
00:53:11,381 --> 00:53:14,475
I mean, he never
was hurtin' for pussy.

637
00:53:14,717 --> 00:53:19,518
I'm not here. I'm walking through
the jungle gathering mangos.

638
00:53:19,622 --> 00:53:22,523
I meet Raquel Welch.

639
00:53:24,293 --> 00:53:29,321
I make a nice
mango cream pudding.

640
00:53:29,432 --> 00:53:32,663
You know, kind of
spread it around on us.

641
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:36,500
She's into mangos too.

642
00:53:36,606 --> 00:53:39,097
She's like one limb above me.

643
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:42,644
- We're both in the jungle here nude.
- Hey, Chief.

644
00:53:42,745 --> 00:53:45,942
- Yeah?
- Here comes that colonel guy again.

645
00:53:47,984 --> 00:53:51,818
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.</i>

646
00:53:51,921 --> 00:53:54,355
<i>I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

647
00:53:54,457 --> 00:53:56,652
<i>I will not hurt
or harm you.</i>

648
00:53:56,759 --> 00:53:59,660
<i>Just give me back
the board, Lance.</i>

649
00:53:59,762 --> 00:54:03,061
<i>It was a good board,
and I like it.</i>

650
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:06,624
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.</i>

651
00:54:06,736 --> 00:54:10,570
<i>- He's a determined motherfucker!
- I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

652
00:54:10,673 --> 00:54:13,073
<i>I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

653
00:54:13,176 --> 00:54:15,974
<i>Just give me back
the board, Lance.</i>

654
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,377
<i>It was a good board,
and I like it.</i>

655
00:54:18,481 --> 00:54:23,145
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.</i>

656
00:54:23,252 --> 00:54:26,221
<i>- I will not hurt or harm you.
- Jesus Christ.</i>

657
00:54:26,322 --> 00:54:28,916
That guy's too
fuckin' much, man.

658
00:54:29,025 --> 00:54:30,993
Do you think
he would have shot us?

659
00:54:31,094 --> 00:54:33,358
He wouldn't have shot us
on the beach...

660
00:54:33,463 --> 00:54:36,261
but he would have shot us
if he saw me taking his board.

661
00:54:36,365 --> 00:54:38,560
<i>Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learnin' how</i>

662
00:54:38,668 --> 00:54:41,034
Let's get this board
out of my turret.

663
00:54:41,137 --> 00:54:42,365
Sucker.

664
00:54:42,472 --> 00:54:44,940
How am I going to shoot him
the next time he comes around?

665
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:49,444
Hey, Chef, make some room
back there for the board.

666
00:54:51,447 --> 00:54:53,881
Sock it to me, Lance.

667
00:54:58,187 --> 00:55:00,519
I wonder if that's
the same chopper.

668
00:55:00,623 --> 00:55:03,820
He's probably got them all over
the river with that recording.

669
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,826
We'll have to hold up here
till dark, Chief.

670
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,987
Don't worry, Lance.
He won't follow us too far.

671
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,826
What makes you say that?

672
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,832
You think that big Cav colonel
wants everyone upriver...

673
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,401
to know we stole his board?

674
00:55:13,503 --> 00:55:15,562
I didn't steal it!

675
00:55:17,673 --> 00:55:19,607
- Captain?
- Hmm?

676
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:22,803
Just how far up
this river we goin'?

677
00:55:22,912 --> 00:55:27,713
It's classified, Chief.
I can't tell ya.

678
00:55:27,817 --> 00:55:29,808
We're goin' up pretty far.

679
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,148
Is it gonna be hairy?

680
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:39,055
I don't know, kid.
Yeah, probably.

681
00:55:39,162 --> 00:55:42,962
You like it like that, Captain,
when it's hot, hairy?

682
00:55:43,065 --> 00:55:45,363
Fuck.

683
00:55:54,944 --> 00:55:57,037
Maybe you'll get
a chance to know...

684
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:59,512
what the fuck you are
in some factory in Ohio.

685
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:04,616
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go
get those mangos now, okay?

686
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,779
- Take somebody with ya.
- Yeah, I'll take-

687
00:56:06,889 --> 00:56:09,119
I'll go with him.

688
00:56:13,729 --> 00:56:15,959
Chef?

689
00:56:16,065 --> 00:56:19,000
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?

690
00:56:19,101 --> 00:56:21,535
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.

691
00:56:21,637 --> 00:56:25,767
- Because you like mangos and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.

692
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:29,971
- I'm a saucier.
- Saucier?

693
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,038
Yes, sir.
See, I come from New Orleans.

694
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:38,587
I was raised to be a saucier,
a great saucier.

695
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:41,919
- What's a saucier?
- You specialize in sauces.

696
00:56:45,928 --> 00:56:49,455
Gotta be a mango tree
here somewhere.

697
00:56:55,104 --> 00:56:57,937
Then, I was supposed
to go to Paris...

698
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,838
study at the Escoffier school.

699
00:57:00,943 --> 00:57:06,108
But then I got orders
for my physical.

700
00:57:15,992 --> 00:57:18,825
Hell, I joined the navy.

701
00:57:18,928 --> 00:57:21,522
Heard they had better food.

702
00:57:21,631 --> 00:57:24,065
Cook school- that did it.

703
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:29,126
- Yeah, how's that?
- You don't wanna hear about that.

704
00:57:30,673 --> 00:57:34,871
They lined us up in front
of a hundred yards of prime rib.

705
00:57:34,977 --> 00:57:38,174
All of us, you know,
lined up lookin' at it.

706
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:42,081
Magnificent meat. Really!
Beautifully marbled.

707
00:57:45,321 --> 00:57:49,087
Next thing, they're throwing
the meat into these big cauldrons-

708
00:57:49,191 --> 00:57:52,183
all of it- boiling it!

709
00:57:52,295 --> 00:57:56,254
I looked inside, man.
It was turning gray.

710
00:57:56,365 --> 00:57:59,266
I couldn't fucking
believe that one.

711
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:05,102
That's when I applied for radioman
school, but then they gave me-

712
00:58:43,946 --> 00:58:46,574
What is it?

713
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:49,583
Charlie?

714
00:59:00,062 --> 00:59:02,121
It's a tiger!

715
00:59:02,231 --> 00:59:07,362
Son of a bitch!
It's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!

716
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:09,961
Battle stations.
Lance, up front.

717
00:59:10,072 --> 00:59:11,369
- Get on your 60!
- Got it.

718
00:59:11,474 --> 00:59:16,207
- Holy shit! A fuckin' tiger!
- Chef, come on!

719
00:59:16,312 --> 00:59:19,372
- Captain, come on!
- Let's hop in and go!

720
00:59:19,482 --> 00:59:21,643
Let's go!

721
00:59:21,751 --> 00:59:24,311
You were right.
Never get out of the boat.

722
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:27,116
- Bring that 60 forward!
- Why never get out of the boat?

723
00:59:27,223 --> 00:59:30,659
I gotta remember!
Never get out of the boat!

724
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,955
Never get out of the boat!

725
00:59:35,064 --> 00:59:38,056
- How many is it?
- A fuckin' tiger!

726
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:40,727
- What?
- A tiger?

727
00:59:40,836 --> 00:59:46,274
Yes! I've had it! I've had
the whole goddamn fuckin' shit, man!

728
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,969
You can kiss my ass
on the county square...

729
00:59:49,078 --> 00:59:51,046
because I'm fuckin' buggin' out.

730
00:59:51,147 --> 00:59:53,047
I didn't come here for this.

731
00:59:53,149 --> 00:59:55,777
I don't fuckin' need it!
I don't want it.

732
00:59:55,885 --> 01:00:00,288
I didn't get out the goddamn
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

733
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:02,653
All I wanted to do
was fuckin' cook!

734
01:00:02,758 --> 01:00:05,955
I just wanted to learn
to fuckin' cook, man!

735
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,962
- You're all right.
- What happened, bro?

736
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,432
You're all right.
You're gonna be all right.

737
01:00:13,536 --> 01:00:17,131
All right?
It's gonna be all right?

738
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:20,731
Never get out
of the fuckin' boat.

739
01:00:20,843 --> 01:00:24,301
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger!
Good-bye!

740
01:00:25,981 --> 01:00:28,415
<i>Never get out of the boat.</i>

741
01:00:28,517 --> 01:00:31,213
<i>Absolutely, goddamn right...</i>

742
01:00:32,321 --> 01:00:35,119
<i>unless you were
going all the way.</i>

743
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:42,295
<i>Kurtz got off the boat.</i>

744
01:00:43,499 --> 01:00:47,401
<i>He split from
the whole fuckin' program.</i>

745
01:00:49,205 --> 01:00:51,799
<i>How did that happen?</i>

746
01:00:51,907 --> 01:00:54,899
<i>What did he see here
that first tour?</i>

747
01:01:01,183 --> 01:01:04,710
<i>Thirty-eight fucking years old.</i>

748
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,754
<i>If you joined
the Green Berets...</i>

749
01:01:06,856 --> 01:01:09,757
<i>there was no way
you'd ever get above colonel.</i>

750
01:01:09,859 --> 01:01:13,955
<i>Kurtz knew what
he was giving up.</i>

751
01:01:14,063 --> 01:01:16,964
<i>The more I read
and began to understand...</i>

752
01:01:17,066 --> 01:01:19,626
<i>the more I admired him.</i>

753
01:01:19,735 --> 01:01:22,397
<i>His family and friends
couldn't understand it...</i>

754
01:01:22,505 --> 01:01:26,168
<i>and they couldn't
talk him out of it.</i>

755
01:01:26,275 --> 01:01:29,733
<i>He had to apply three times,
and he put up with a ton of shit.</i>

756
01:01:29,845 --> 01:01:33,110
<i>But when he threatened
to resign, they gave it to him.</i>

757
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,579
<i>The next youngest guy
in his class was half his age.</i>

758
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:44,318
<i>They must have thought
he was some far-out old man...</i>

759
01:01:44,426 --> 01:01:46,826
<i>humping it over that course.</i>

760
01:01:46,929 --> 01:01:51,491
<i>I did it when I was 19.
It damn near wasted me.</i>

761
01:01:53,068 --> 01:01:55,468
<i>A tough motherfucker.</i>

762
01:01:56,805 --> 01:01:58,739
<i>He finished it.</i>

763
01:02:00,776 --> 01:02:04,303
<i>He could have gone for general...</i>

764
01:02:04,413 --> 01:02:07,314
<i>but he went for himself instead.</i>

765
01:02:09,752 --> 01:02:11,686
Dear Eva...

766
01:02:11,787 --> 01:02:14,517
Today was really a new one.

767
01:02:14,623 --> 01:02:19,458
Almost got eaten alive
by a fuckin' tiger.

768
01:02:19,562 --> 01:02:22,087
Really un-fucking believable,
you know?

769
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:25,166
We're taking this guy,
Captain Willard, up the river...

770
01:02:25,267 --> 01:02:28,327
but he hasn't told us yet
where we're taking him.

771
01:02:28,437 --> 01:02:30,337
<i>Come on, baby</i>

772
01:02:30,439 --> 01:02:32,873
Thought you might have
heard by now from Elwood.

773
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:36,741
<i>October 1967.
On special assignment...</i>

774
01:02:36,845 --> 01:02:39,040
<i>Kontoom Province, II Corps.</i>

775
01:02:39,148 --> 01:02:43,141
<i>Kurtz staged Operation Archangel
with combined local forces.</i>

776
01:02:43,252 --> 01:02:45,652
<i>Rated a major success.</i>

777
01:02:48,757 --> 01:02:51,317
<i>He received
no official clearance.</i>

778
01:02:51,427 --> 01:02:55,158
<i>He just thought it up
and did it.</i>

779
01:02:55,264 --> 01:02:58,529
<i>What balls.</i>

780
01:02:58,634 --> 01:03:01,865
<i>They were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one.</i>

781
01:03:01,971 --> 01:03:04,599
<i>But after the press
got a hold of it...</i>

782
01:03:04,707 --> 01:03:06,868
<i>they promoted him
to full colonel instead.</i>

783
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:13,177
<i>Oh, man, the bullshit
piled up so fast in Vietnam.</i>

784
01:03:13,282 --> 01:03:17,878
<i>You needed wings
to stay above it.</i>

785
01:03:43,746 --> 01:03:47,648
This sure enough is a bizarre sight
in the middle of this shit.

786
01:03:49,018 --> 01:03:51,851
Expecting us this time?

787
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:53,888
Damned if I know.

788
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:01,062
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

789
01:04:01,163 --> 01:04:03,290
Jesus-

790
01:04:07,236 --> 01:04:09,500
Wow.

791
01:04:09,605 --> 01:04:13,837
- It goes back up into the truck.
- What?

792
01:04:13,942 --> 01:04:16,638
We gotta get
all that stuff up.

793
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,877
Hau Phat. You ever been
up here before, Chef?

794
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:25,886
I bet you we can score up here.

795
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:28,855
Check out the bikes, Lance.

796
01:04:28,957 --> 01:04:31,892
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!

797
01:04:31,994 --> 01:04:35,259
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, Sukiyaki.

798
01:04:35,364 --> 01:04:37,628
Yeah, man.
This is something.

799
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,603
- Please!
- This must be the guy.

800
01:04:42,705 --> 01:04:45,071
Right over there.

801
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:47,506
Sergeant. Sergeant.

802
01:04:53,782 --> 01:04:55,943
Three drums of diesel fuel,
PBR five-

803
01:04:56,051 --> 01:04:57,882
Come on, man! Move!

804
01:04:57,986 --> 01:05:00,113
We don't have time. One hour.
That's all. What do you want?

805
01:05:00,222 --> 01:05:03,555
- Can I get some Panama Red?
- Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

806
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:06,992
- Sergeant?
- Destination?

807
01:05:07,096 --> 01:05:08,495
I don't have no destination.

808
01:05:08,597 --> 01:05:10,861
I can't do a goddamn thing
without a destination.

809
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:14,424
- Sarge? Sarge?
- I need a destination!

810
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,561
I can't do a thing about it
with a destination.

811
01:05:16,672 --> 01:05:19,436
These guys are with me.
Destination's classified.

812
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,907
I carry priority papers
from Com-Sec Intelligence.

813
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:25,639
Okay, right, sir. Hey, listen,
it's a real big night.

814
01:05:25,748 --> 01:05:28,808
Eight bucks for that-
Hey!

815
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:31,181
All right. Damn.

816
01:05:31,286 --> 01:05:34,778
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.

817
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,859
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.

818
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,054
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.

819
01:05:41,163 --> 01:05:45,827
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk and you got it.

820
01:05:45,934 --> 01:05:49,131
Would you guys like some seats-
some press box seats for the show?

821
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:51,706
The show out here.

822
01:05:51,807 --> 01:05:54,275
- Bunnies, bunnies.
- Playboy bunnies?

823
01:05:54,376 --> 01:05:56,207
You got it.
You gonna be here?

824
01:05:56,311 --> 01:05:59,576
Hey, listen, Captain,
on the house.

825
01:05:59,681 --> 01:06:03,549
No hard feelings, huh?

826
01:06:38,554 --> 01:06:40,818
<i>How ya doin' out there?</i>

827
01:06:40,923 --> 01:06:43,721
<i>I said, how ya doin' out there?</i>

828
01:06:43,826 --> 01:06:46,158
<i>Wanna say hello to you
from all of us up here...</i>

829
01:06:46,261 --> 01:06:48,161
<i>to all of you
out there who work...</i>

830
01:06:48,263 --> 01:06:51,460
<i>so goddamn hard

831
01:06:51,567 --> 01:06:54,764
<i>Hello, all you
paratroopers out there!</i>

832
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:58,362
<i>And the marines!
And the sailors!</i>

833
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,407
<i>We wanna let you know
that we're proud of you!</i>

834
01:07:00,509 --> 01:07:04,104
<i>We know how tough
and how hard it's been.</i>

835
01:07:04,213 --> 01:07:07,307
<i>To prove it we're gonna give you
entertainment you're gonna like.</i>

836
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:11,512
<i>Miss August,
Miss Sandra Beatty.</i>

837
01:07:13,155 --> 01:07:17,649
<i>Miss May,
Miss Terri Teray! Yeah!</i>

838
01:07:17,759 --> 01:07:23,595
<i>And the playmate of the year,
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!</i>

839
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:25,894
Yo! Whoa!

840
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:28,970
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i>

841
01:07:29,071 --> 01:07:31,972
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i>

842
01:07:33,308 --> 01:07:36,766
<i>- Oh, Susie-Q, baby, I love you
- Hello!</i>

843
01:07:36,879 --> 01:07:39,439
<i>Susie-Q</i>

844
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:43,985
<i>I like the way you walk</i>

845
01:07:44,086 --> 01:07:46,213
<i>I like the way you talk</i>

846
01:07:46,321 --> 01:07:49,586
<i>I like the way you walk</i>

847
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:53,559
<i>I like the way you talk
Susie-Q</i>

848
01:07:55,564 --> 01:07:58,499
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i>

849
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,693
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i>

850
01:08:02,304 --> 01:08:06,400
<i>Oh, Susie-Q
Baby, I love you</i>

851
01:08:06,508 --> 01:08:08,442
<i>Susie-Q</i>

852
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:11,535
<i>I love you!</i>

853
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:17,250
- Come on!
- What's the matter?

854
01:08:17,352 --> 01:08:19,252
Come on, baby!

855
01:08:25,594 --> 01:08:27,824
Grease my gun!

856
01:08:35,203 --> 01:08:37,569
I'm ready to powwow, baby!

857
01:08:52,354 --> 01:08:54,379
Come on! All right!

858
01:08:54,489 --> 01:08:56,753
You're cute. I like you.

859
01:08:56,858 --> 01:08:59,986
I'm here, baby! I'm here!

860
01:09:03,999 --> 01:09:06,866
Yeah!

861
01:09:06,969 --> 01:09:09,301
- You fucking bitch!
- Take it off!

862
01:09:09,404 --> 01:09:11,031
Take it off!

863
01:09:11,139 --> 01:09:14,802
Hey, lover!
You want us to come over!

864
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:18,869
- I sure do!
- Sign my centerfold!

865
01:09:21,249 --> 01:09:23,149
Sign my centerfold!

866
01:09:23,251 --> 01:09:25,947
Come on, baby!

867
01:09:26,054 --> 01:09:28,318
Goddamn!

868
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:41,397
Start her up. Hey!

869
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:45,496
Get out of my way!

870
01:09:45,607 --> 01:09:47,234
Come on!

871
01:09:50,379 --> 01:09:54,008
- Will you sign these?
- Let's go! Let's go!

872
01:09:59,788 --> 01:10:02,848
Hurry!

873
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,935
So long!

874
01:10:56,945 --> 01:10:59,812
<i>Charlie didn't get much USO.</i>

875
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:05,516
<i>He was dug in too deep
or moving too fast.</i>

876
01:11:08,623 --> 01:11:13,560
<i>His idea of great R and R was
cold rice and a little rat meat.</i>

877
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:17,763
<i>He had only two ways home-</i>

878
01:11:17,866 --> 01:11:21,302
<i>death or victory.</i>

879
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:35,375
<i>No wonder Kurtz put
a weed up Command's ass.</i>

880
01:11:36,852 --> 01:11:40,253
<i>The war was being run by
a bunch of four-star clowns...</i>

881
01:11:40,355 --> 01:11:44,587
<i>who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away.</i>

882
01:11:44,693 --> 01:11:47,560
Hey, you know, man,
that was far-fucking-out.

883
01:11:47,662 --> 01:11:51,223
I collected every picture of her
since she was Miss December, Chief.

884
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:54,302
Hey, Clean, look at that.
She was here, man.

885
01:11:54,402 --> 01:11:57,235
I even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.

886
01:11:57,339 --> 01:11:59,330
You can really get hung up
on these broads, man...

887
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:01,341
just like that cat in the delta.

888
01:12:01,443 --> 01:12:03,536
- Yeah, you better believe it.
- What cat?

889
01:12:03,645 --> 01:12:06,637
The one that went up for murder.
He was an army sergeant.

890
01:12:06,748 --> 01:12:11,276
<i>Remember? This cat, man-
He really dug his Playboy, man.</i>

891
01:12:11,386 --> 01:12:12,546
Dig it.

892
01:12:12,654 --> 01:12:15,782
When the thing arrived,
he was there to meet it, man.

893
01:12:15,891 --> 01:12:19,452
Look at these beautiful
fuckin' jugs, man!

894
01:12:19,561 --> 01:12:22,462
Yeah, so anyway,
he was workin' ARVN patrols.

895
01:12:22,564 --> 01:12:26,022
One of them cocky gook asshole
lieutenants and shit-

896
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:29,297
One day the gook took his magazine
and wouldn't give it back.

897
01:12:29,404 --> 01:12:31,998
He said, "Give me
my magazine back."

898
01:12:32,107 --> 01:12:35,804
Gook say, "You shut up.
I have you court-martialed."

899
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:38,038
- Typical fuckin' ARVN.
- Yeah!

900
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:42,082
- Then the gook starts to go too far.
- Chef. Take the wheel.

901
01:12:42,184 --> 01:12:46,280
This dude started to stick
pinholes in the lady's tits.

902
01:12:46,388 --> 01:12:47,855
Take the wheel.

903
01:12:47,956 --> 01:12:52,290
He started sticking pinholes
and mutilating the centerfold.

904
01:12:52,394 --> 01:12:55,386
The sergeant said,
"You better not do that to her.

905
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:57,488
You leave your shitty little
gook hands off of that girl.

906
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,499
Don't do her like that."

907
01:12:59,601 --> 01:13:04,368
- Gook say "Fuck you" in Vietnamese.
- Damn.

908
01:13:04,472 --> 01:13:07,737
The sergeant couldn't
handle it no more.

909
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:10,106
He just picked up his iron...

910
01:13:10,212 --> 01:13:12,612
flipped it to
rock and roll and-

911
01:13:12,714 --> 01:13:14,773
Boom!

912
01:13:14,883 --> 01:13:17,613
<i>Gave that little zero a long burst
straight through the Playboy mag.</i>

913
01:13:17,719 --> 01:13:20,654
It blew his ass clean
off of the dock.

914
01:13:20,755 --> 01:13:26,057
There wasn't no more lieutenant
that day. That was it for his ass.

915
01:13:26,161 --> 01:13:30,063
- They burn him for it?
- The sergeant? Yeah, man.

916
01:13:30,165 --> 01:13:32,156
They stuck his ass
in the LBJ.

917
01:13:32,267 --> 01:13:35,964
It's too bad he didn't
get no medals or nothin'.

918
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,399
Fuckin' ARVN, man.

919
01:13:40,508 --> 01:13:42,408
They should have killed the fuck.

920
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:46,708
Should have given
the fucker a Silver Star.

921
01:13:46,815 --> 01:13:51,514
Bummer for the gook though,
ain't it?

922
01:13:55,423 --> 01:13:57,254
<i>Good morning, Vietnam.</i>

923
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:00,157
<i>I'm Army Specialist
Zack Johnson on AMVN.</i>

924
01:14:00,262 --> 01:14:04,562
<i>It's about 82 degrees in downtown
Saigon right now, also very humid.</i>

925

<i>We have an important message
for all GI's...</i>

926
01:14:06,668 --> 01:14:09,102
<i>who are living off base
from the mayor of Saigon.</i>

927
01:14:09,204 --> 01:14:10,831
<i>He'd like you to hang
your laundry up indoors...</i>

928
01:14:10,939 --> 01:14:12,338
<i>instead of on the windowsills.</i>

929
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:15,841
<i>The mayor wants you
to keep Saigon beautiful.</i>

930
01:14:15,944 --> 01:14:18,174
<i>Now here's another blast from
the past going out to Big Sam...</i>

931
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:22,114
<i>who's all alone out there with
the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry...</i>

932
01:14:22,217 --> 01:14:26,745
<i>and dedicated by the fire team
to their groovy CO.</i>

933
01:14:26,855 --> 01:14:29,722
<i>- The Rolling Stones, "Satisfaction."
- All right!</i>

934
01:14:30,825 --> 01:14:33,851
<i>Watch out, Clean!</i>

935
01:14:33,962 --> 01:14:36,123
<i>Get down, bubba!</i>

936
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,731
<i>I can't get no</i>

937
01:14:41,836 --> 01:14:44,737
<i>Satisfaction</i>

938
01:14:44,839 --> 01:14:46,204
Hang on, Lance!

939
01:14:46,308 --> 01:14:48,776
<i>I can't get no</i>

940
01:14:48,877 --> 01:14:51,869

<i>'Cause I try and I try</i>

942
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:57,607

944
01:15:00,855 --> 01:15:02,823
<i>I can't get no</i>

945
01:15:02,924 --> 01:15:06,291
Yeah!

946
01:15:06,394 --> 01:15:08,954
<i>When I'm drivin' in my car</i>

947
01:15:09,064 --> 01:15:12,864
<i>- And the man comes on the radio
- Tell 'em you did it, Lance.</i>

948
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,935
<i>He's tellin' me
more and more</i>

949
01:15:15,036 --> 01:15:20,269
<i>- I see you is right on target.
- About useless information</i>

950
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:24,471
- Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
- All right!

951
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:28,174
Look out, Lance!

952
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:33,818

<i>As long as cold beer,
hot food, rock and roll...</i>

<i>and all the other amenities

<i>We need fewer men, and better.</i>

Shit. Chicken time.

You ain't shittin', bro.
They're motherfuckin'.

966
01:16:12,961 --> 01:16:16,226
Who is that?

967
01:16:17,665 --> 01:16:20,657
Is that you, Lazzaro?

968
01:16:20,769 --> 01:16:23,169
Don't chicken out.

969
01:16:29,144 --> 01:16:33,137
Lazzaro!

970
01:16:33,248 --> 01:16:35,216
Come on!

01:16:35,316 --> 01:16:40,515

976
01:17:22,497 --> 01:17:26,593
<i>Late summer, autumn 1968.</i>

977
01:17:26,701 --> 01:17:30,899
<i>Kurtz's patrols in the highlands

978
01:17:31,005 --> 01:17:33,235
<i>The camp started falling apart.</i>

979
01:17:39,581 --> 01:17:41,549
<i>November.</i>

980
01:17:41,649 --> 01:17:46,416
<i>Kurtz orders assassination of
three Vietnamese men and one woman.</i>

981
01:17:46,521 --> 01:17:50,617
<i>Two of the men were colonels

982
01:17:52,927 --> 01:17:55,828
<i>Enemy activity in his old sector
dropped off to nothing.</i>

983
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:04,394
<i>Guess he must have hit
the right four people.</i>

984
01:18:04,506 --> 01:18:10,035
<i>He joined the Special Forces.
After that his-</i>

985
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:13,580
<i>The army tried one last time
to bring him back into the fold.</i>

986
01:18:13,681 --> 01:18:16,206
<i>- methods-
- If he'd pulled over...</i>

987
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:19,309
<i>- it all would have been forgotten.
- unsound.</i>

988
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,320
<i>But he kept going.</i>

989
01:18:21,422 --> 01:18:24,516
<i>- Now he's crossed into Cambodia-
- He kept winning it his way.</i>

990
01:18:24,626 --> 01:18:27,595
<i>- with this Montagnard army of his-
- And they called me in.</i>

<i>Man like a god and follow
every order, however ridiculous.</i>

992
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:38,762

993
01:18:38,873 --> 01:18:41,364

<i>mostly from captured VC.</i>

996
01:18:48,383 --> 01:18:52,615
<i>The VC knew his name by now,

<i>He and his men were

998

<i>all the way into Cambodia.</i>

999
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,360
I know what I'm doin'.

1000
01:19:04,465 --> 01:19:06,524
I'm goin' to the White House
to have dinner...

1001
01:19:06,634 --> 01:19:09,262
with the president
of the United States.

1002
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:11,531
That's where I'm goin'.

1003
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:14,005
Hey, Chef,
put the cover on that.

1004
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:18,137
Clean.

1005
01:19:20,748 --> 01:19:23,308
How long has that kid
been on this boat?

1006
01:19:23,418 --> 01:19:25,477
Seven months.

1007
01:19:25,587 --> 01:19:28,920
He's really specializing
in busting my balls.

1008
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:31,719
Very possible, Captain,
he thinks the same of you.

1009
01:19:31,826 --> 01:19:37,196
- Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?
- I don't think.

1010
01:19:37,298 --> 01:19:39,926
My orders say I'm not supposed to
know where I'm taking this boat...

1011
01:19:40,034 --> 01:19:41,934
so I don't!

1012
01:19:42,036 --> 01:19:47,372
But one look at you, and I know
it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

1013
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:59,918
We're going upriver about
75 clicks above the Do Lung Bridge.

1014
01:20:04,225 --> 01:20:07,251
- That's Cambodia, Captain.
- That's classified.

1015
01:20:07,362 --> 01:20:12,322
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,
but that's where I'm going.

1016
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,958
You just get me close
to my destination...

1017
01:20:15,069 --> 01:20:16,969
and I'll cut you
and the crew loose.

1018
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:22,367
All right, Captain.

1019
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:45,924
<i>"Dear Son...</i>

1020
01:20:46,034 --> 01:20:48,502
<i>I'm afraid that both you and your
mother will have been worried...</i>

1021
01:20:48,603 --> 01:20:51,868
<i>at not hearing from me
during the past weeks...</i>

1022
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:55,773
<i>but my situation here
has become a difficult one.</i>

1023
01:20:55,877 --> 01:20:59,472
<i>I have been officially
accused of murder by the army.</i>

1024
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:09,456
<i>The alleged victims were
four Vietnamese double agents.</i>

1025
01:21:09,557 --> 01:21:13,584
<i>We spent months uncovering them
and accumulating evidence.</i>

1026
01:21:15,363 --> 01:21:20,630
<i>When absolute proof was completed,
we acted- we acted like soldiers.</i>

1027
01:21:20,735 --> 01:21:23,226
<i>The charges are unjustified.</i>

1028
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:27,068
<i>They are, in fact, and in the
circumstances of this conflict...</i>

1029
01:21:27,175 --> 01:21:29,405
<i>quite completely insane.</i>

1030
01:21:39,887 --> 01:21:44,551
<i>In a war, there are many moments
for compassion and tender action.</i>

1031
01:21:44,659 --> 01:21:47,594
<i>There are many moments
for ruthless action-</i>

1032
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:50,129
<i>what is often
called ruthless...</i>

1033
01:21:50,231 --> 01:21:53,530
<i>but may in many circumstances
be only clarity-</i>

1034
01:21:53,634 --> 01:21:55,602
<i>seeing clearly what there is
to be done and doing it-"</i>

1035
01:21:55,703 --> 01:21:57,534
<i>- Medevac, come in.
- "directly-</i>

1036
01:21:57,638 --> 01:22:01,199
<i>- quickly, awake."
- Alpha, Tango, Tango, Echo, Tango, Alpha.</i>

1037
01:22:01,309 --> 01:22:03,573
<i>- "Looking at it."
- Request dust-off.</i>

1038
01:22:03,678 --> 01:22:05,771
<i>Three, maybe four KIA's. Over.</i>

1039
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,077
<i>"I trust you to tell your mother
what you choose about this letter.</i>

1040
01:22:09,183 --> 01:22:12,311
<i>As for the charges against me,
I am unconcerned."</i>

1041
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:14,320
<i>Medevac, come in.</i>

1042
01:22:14,422 --> 01:22:18,324
<i>"I am beyond their timid, lying
morality, and so I am beyond caring."</i>

1043
01:22:18,426 --> 01:22:20,326
<i>Medevac, do you read? Over.</i>

1044
01:22:20,428 --> 01:22:23,886
<i>"You have all my faith.
Your loving father."</i>

1045
01:22:42,817 --> 01:22:44,978
Jesus.

1046
01:22:45,086 --> 01:22:47,884
No wonder I couldn't
get 'em on the radio.

1047
01:22:47,989 --> 01:22:49,889
What a dump.

1048
01:22:53,828 --> 01:22:55,819
- Hi there!
- How ya doin'?

1049
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:57,989
Wow. That's a nice
little boat you got there.

1050
01:22:58,099 --> 01:23:00,192
Never seen one
up here before.

1051
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:03,236
We called in a request
for Medevac. You receive it?

1052
01:23:03,337 --> 01:23:05,237
Medevac? No.

1053
01:23:05,339 --> 01:23:07,705
We passed a downed Huey
with some KIA's.

1054
01:23:07,809 --> 01:23:10,972
- On your way here?
- Yeah.

1055
01:23:11,078 --> 01:23:14,172
- You goin' up this river?
- Way up.

1056
01:23:14,282 --> 01:23:18,082
- Way upriver? Forget it.
- Why?

1057
01:23:18,186 --> 01:23:21,713
We want to send
some people downriver.

1058
01:23:21,823 --> 01:23:24,189
- Just forget it.
- What the fuck was that?

1059
01:23:24,292 --> 01:23:27,819
- We'll be back in a couple of days.
- Yeah, right, you'll be back.

1060
01:23:34,202 --> 01:23:36,102
- Chief?
- Yeah, Captain?

1061
01:23:36,204 --> 01:23:38,104
Why don't you see what
you can do with that engine?

1062
01:23:38,206 --> 01:23:40,174
- I'm gonna look around.
- All right.

1063
01:23:40,274 --> 01:23:43,641
Hey, don't leave without me.

1064
01:24:04,398 --> 01:24:07,094
Hey, soldier, where's your CO?

1065
01:24:07,201 --> 01:24:09,226
Don't ask me, man.

1066
01:24:30,124 --> 01:24:32,354
Give my clothes back,
you asshole!

1067
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:38,724
Asshole!

1068
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:45,000
Hey, guys, where's the CO?

1069
01:24:45,106 --> 01:24:50,203
He stepped on a land mine about two
months ago. He got blown to hell.

1070
01:24:50,311 --> 01:24:53,246
- Who's in charge here?
- Charge?

1071
01:24:53,347 --> 01:24:55,440
I don't know, man.
I'm just the night man.

1072
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:58,985
Just do what I'm told. Shit.
I'm just a working girl.

1073
01:24:59,086 --> 01:25:01,714
What about you, fella?

1074
01:25:01,822 --> 01:25:05,314
Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you
it's gonna jam. You mark my words.

1075
01:25:05,426 --> 01:25:08,190
- Keep it in that condition-
- Get off my back!

1076
01:25:08,296 --> 01:25:10,355
- No, man, I'm telling you-
- Lay off!

1077
01:25:11,866 --> 01:25:15,324
Hey! Hey! Come here!

1078
01:25:15,436 --> 01:25:18,064
Is that your boat?
Come on inside.

1079
01:25:18,172 --> 01:25:20,766
What do you want?

1080
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:24,072
Come on inside.
I want to talk to you. Come on!

1081
01:25:26,614 --> 01:25:28,707
Get out of the rain.

1082
01:25:28,816 --> 01:25:31,182
Get off me!

1083
01:25:31,285 --> 01:25:33,515
Come on. Cut this shit.
Hey, Chef. Hey, come on.

1084
01:25:33,621 --> 01:25:38,217
Hey, how ya doin', Captain?
I want you to meet some people.

1085
01:25:38,326 --> 01:25:42,057
- I got your ass.
- Your ass is shit.

1086
01:25:42,163 --> 01:25:45,223
Chef, your ass is shit!

1087
01:25:50,871 --> 01:25:54,398
You're a motherfucker, man.

1088
01:25:54,508 --> 01:25:57,136
Goddamn, my ear,
you motherfucker!

1089
01:25:59,513 --> 01:26:03,142
- Get him off me, Chef.
- You smart-ass.

1090
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,377
Hey, guys.

1091
01:26:05,486 --> 01:26:08,250
I got you!
I got your ass!

1092
01:26:08,356 --> 01:26:11,814
- You ain't shit, Chef.
- Hey, fellas.

1093
01:26:11,926 --> 01:26:15,953
- You pulled my fuckin'-
- Hey, guys.

1094
01:26:16,063 --> 01:26:19,555
I just made a deal with
the people from Hau Phat.

1095
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:24,434
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for
a couple of hours with the bunnies.

1096
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:32,636
Whoa. Whoa. Captain!

1097
01:26:32,747 --> 01:26:35,648
Hey! Hey! You shittin' me?

1098
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:39,277
No, I'm not. Grab a couple of
barrels and get up to that big tent.

1099
01:26:39,387 --> 01:26:41,446
Come on!

1100
01:26:42,556 --> 01:26:44,581
Captain.

1101
01:26:44,692 --> 01:26:48,093
You're giving away our fuel
for a playmate of the month?

1102
01:26:48,195 --> 01:26:52,291
Nope, playmate
of the year, Chief.

1103
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:56,063
Warm 'em up, baby!
Warm 'em up!

1104
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:58,866
Captain, we get in a fire fight
and run out of fuel...

1105
01:26:58,973 --> 01:27:01,464
I want you to tell me
how she was.

1106
01:27:01,575 --> 01:27:06,603
I made a deal for all of us, Chief.
How about you?

1107
01:27:09,216 --> 01:27:12,617
- You got some mamas in there?
- Some what?

1108
01:27:14,755 --> 01:27:18,384
Forget it, Captain.
I'll stay with the boat.

1109
01:27:18,492 --> 01:27:22,053
Hey, Captain!
Give me a hand.

1110
01:27:41,282 --> 01:27:43,216
You know, I got a-

1111
01:27:43,317 --> 01:27:45,410
I got every one
of your pictures.

1112
01:27:45,519 --> 01:27:48,352
I got the centerfold,
the playmate's review...

1113
01:27:48,456 --> 01:27:51,152
the playmate of the year runoff.

1114
01:27:51,258 --> 01:27:53,226
I even got the calendar.

1115
01:27:53,327 --> 01:27:58,594
<i>Hey, oiseau.
How come you got a bird?</i>

1116
01:27:58,699 --> 01:28:01,600
I used to be the bird girl
at Busch Gardens.

1117
01:28:01,702 --> 01:28:05,798
- Busch Gardens?
- I used to train birds there.

1118
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:07,806
You are-

1119
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:11,002
- You are Miss December, aren't you?
- Miss May.

1120
01:28:11,112 --> 01:28:13,080
Is it coming?

1121
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:23,386
- Miss December has black hair.
- It's over there.

1122
01:28:23,491 --> 01:28:27,257
He's not one
of my regular birds.

1123
01:28:27,361 --> 01:28:31,263
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
Snatch a crack. Come here.

1124
01:28:31,365 --> 01:28:34,698
Being playmate of the year...

1125
01:28:34,802 --> 01:28:38,294
is the loneliest experience
I can imagine.

1126
01:28:39,507 --> 01:28:43,034
It's like-
You try to express...

1127
01:28:43,144 --> 01:28:47,979
your feelings to someone
and show them your heart-

1128
01:28:48,082 --> 01:28:49,982
Yeah, I want to hear
about your bird act.

1129
01:28:50,084 --> 01:28:51,984
I'd love to hear
about your bird act.

1130
01:28:52,086 --> 01:28:55,988
But would you mind
just puttin' this-

1131
01:28:56,090 --> 01:29:00,789
Would you just mind putting
this black wig on for me, please?

1132
01:29:00,895 --> 01:29:03,625
And there's
this glass wall between you-

1133
01:29:03,731 --> 01:29:06,359
this invisible glass.

1134
01:29:06,467 --> 01:29:09,095
They can see
your mouth moving.

1135
01:29:09,203 --> 01:29:11,671
I used to train birds
for at least two years-

1136
01:29:11,772 --> 01:29:13,706
- That's beautiful.
- at Busch Gardens.

1137
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:17,072
This was cascading over your
right shoulder. This was open here.

1138
01:29:17,178 --> 01:29:20,807
But they can't hear
what you're saying.

1139
01:29:20,915 --> 01:29:24,851
I used to train them to stand
on their head and ride a bicycle-

1140
01:29:24,952 --> 01:29:26,852
Your right hand was-

1141
01:29:26,954 --> 01:29:28,854
Hey, Chef!

1142
01:29:28,956 --> 01:29:31,948
- Get outta here, man!
- Come on!

1143
01:29:32,059 --> 01:29:34,994
- Does he want to talk to you?
- Later. Give me 15 minutes.

1144
01:29:35,095 --> 01:29:39,122
You can never really make them hear
what you're trying to say.

1145
01:29:39,233 --> 01:29:42,327
You okay with kind of bending?
That's it.

1146
01:29:42,436 --> 01:29:44,870
Your ass was sticking out
just a little- Hey, man, fuck off!

1147
01:29:44,972 --> 01:29:46,940
Fifteen minutes!

1148
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:50,909
That's why I tried
so desperately...

1149
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:54,469
to show somebody
that I had some talent.

1150
01:29:54,582 --> 01:29:56,550
Little baby macaws.

1151
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:59,517
- Have you ever seen a baby macaw?
- That's kind of open there.

1152
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:01,850
- They're all blue-
- Take off, would you?

1153
01:30:01,956 --> 01:30:05,119
I got my rights, man!

1154
01:30:05,226 --> 01:30:07,956
They make you do things
you don't wanna do-

1155
01:30:08,062 --> 01:30:11,554
like, this picture here.

1156
01:30:14,368 --> 01:30:18,737
I started feeling
repulsed with myself.

1157
01:30:18,839 --> 01:30:22,434
You were just kind of bending
forward. Your ass kind of out a bit.

1158
01:30:22,543 --> 01:30:25,205
- I love training birds.
- That's it.

1159
01:30:25,312 --> 01:30:28,713
That's it. That's very-
That's it. Voila.

1160
01:30:28,816 --> 01:30:32,877
You're beautiful.
I just want to-

1161
01:30:32,987 --> 01:30:35,854
You know, I can't believe it.

1162
01:30:35,956 --> 01:30:40,222
Me, J. Hicks.
I can't believe I'm really here.

1163
01:30:40,327 --> 01:30:44,923
Maybe I'm unfit
to have a relationship...

1164
01:30:45,032 --> 01:30:49,901
with a beautiful, innocent boy.

1165
01:30:50,004 --> 01:30:53,496
Just think, if it hadn't
been for the Vietnam War...

1166
01:30:53,607 --> 01:30:55,905
I never would have met you,
Miss December.

1167
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:57,534
Miss May.

1168
01:30:57,645 --> 01:31:02,446
I wish-
I wish I could find...

1169
01:31:02,549 --> 01:31:05,382
just one person...

1170
01:31:07,021 --> 01:31:09,888
that could share
my point of view.

1171
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:18,489
Oh, you kiss like a bird!

1172
01:31:18,599 --> 01:31:20,794
Oh, God! Kiss me! Kiss me!

1173
01:31:21,802 --> 01:31:23,201
Who is that?

1174
01:31:23,304 --> 01:31:28,936
- You're drivin' me crazy! Kiss me!
- I love birds!

1175
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:36,677
You finished yet?

1176
01:31:36,784 --> 01:31:39,617
Oh! Fuck!

1177
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,120
Like a bird!
Take me like a bird!

1178
01:31:42,222 --> 01:31:45,419
Fly, baby! Cock it to me!

1179
01:31:45,526 --> 01:31:48,222
- Fly!
- I can fly like an eagle!

1180
01:31:48,329 --> 01:31:51,162
- Fly like an eagle!
- It drives me crazy!

1181
01:31:51,265 --> 01:31:54,428
It drives me crazy!

1182
01:32:02,609 --> 01:32:06,375
Lance, that was somebody's son.

1183
01:32:08,949 --> 01:32:13,249
Lance, there were things
that they made me do...

1184
01:32:13,354 --> 01:32:15,447
that I didn't want to do.

1185
01:32:15,556 --> 01:32:19,287
They said, "Pull the ribbons
between your legs."

1186
01:32:19,393 --> 01:32:21,827
I didn't want to do it.

1187
01:32:21,929 --> 01:32:25,660
But they said that was
what was expected of me...

1188
01:32:25,766 --> 01:32:28,496
that that's what people
wanted to see.

1189
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:54,149
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm next, ma'am.

1190
01:32:54,261 --> 01:32:56,923
Ha, ha! Hell,
I didn't know it was a cherry.

1191
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:59,726
- Didn't know you never got no pussy.
- Shove it, fuckup.

1192
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:02,666
Sorry about that. If I'd have
known, I'd take you to New Orleans.

1193
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:05,170
- Man, fuck you.
- Introduce you to-

1194
01:33:05,272 --> 01:33:08,799
- Lay off, Chef.
- Cherry boy, cherry boy.

1195
01:33:08,909 --> 01:33:11,173
You're a fuckin' dog!

1196
01:33:11,278 --> 01:33:14,543
Come to New Orleans.
I'll get you fixed up, ya prick.

1197
01:33:14,648 --> 01:33:16,548
Lay off, Chef.

1198
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:18,550
You're the only fuckin' prick
I see around here.

1199
01:33:18,652 --> 01:33:20,552
If I wanna play with a prick,
I'll play with my own.

1200
01:33:20,654 --> 01:33:21,552
Lay off!

1201
01:33:21,655 --> 01:33:24,215
What are you gonna
do with it, cherry boy?

1202
01:33:24,324 --> 01:33:25,689
Chef, I said lay off!

1203
01:33:25,793 --> 01:33:30,230
Chef, knock it off! Give him
a break! What do you think I said?

1204
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:32,264
Then give your jaws a rest!

1205
01:33:32,366 --> 01:33:36,393
This ain't the army.
You are a sailor!

1206
01:33:36,503 --> 01:33:38,733
So get out of that
frizzly army-looking shirt...

1207
01:33:38,839 --> 01:33:40,773
and stop smoking that dope!

1208
01:33:40,874 --> 01:33:42,774
You hear me?

1209
01:33:46,613 --> 01:33:49,275
Lance, what's with
all the green paint?

1210
01:33:49,383 --> 01:33:51,749
- Camouflage.
- How's that?

1211
01:33:51,852 --> 01:33:53,877
So they can't see ya.
They're everywhere, Chief.

1212
01:33:53,987 --> 01:33:57,423
I want you to stay awake up there,
man. You got a job to do.

1213
01:34:14,641 --> 01:34:18,543
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.

1214
01:34:18,645 --> 01:34:21,079
Let's take a look. Lance.

1215
01:34:21,181 --> 01:34:25,675
Bring them in.
Clean, on the 60. Chef, get a 16.

1216
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:28,448
Clean, get on that 60!

1217
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:32,090
What's up, Chief?

1218
01:34:33,527 --> 01:34:35,961
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

1219
01:34:36,063 --> 01:34:39,464
Well, let's forget routine now
and let 'em go.

1220
01:34:39,566 --> 01:34:42,467
These boats are running supplies
in this delta, Captain.

1221
01:34:42,569 --> 01:34:45,003
I'm gonna take a look.

1222
01:34:45,105 --> 01:34:47,039
My mission's got priority.

1223
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:50,007
You wouldn't even be in this part
of the river if it wasn't for me.

1224
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:53,637
Until we reach your destination,
Captain, you're just on for the ride.

1225
01:34:53,747 --> 01:34:57,444
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on. Throw the rope, asshole.

1226
01:34:57,551 --> 01:35:00,486
All right. Come on.
Let's bring it over.

1227
01:35:13,634 --> 01:35:17,035
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

1228
01:35:22,876 --> 01:35:26,209
Come on!
Hurry up, motherfucker!

1229
01:35:27,881 --> 01:35:29,109
<i>Can couc, you too.</i>

1230
01:35:29,216 --> 01:35:31,514
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.
- I got you, Chief.

1231
01:35:35,822 --> 01:35:38,154
It's clear, Chief.

1232
01:35:42,896 --> 01:35:47,060
Okay, that's them.
That's them. They're okay.

1233
01:35:47,167 --> 01:35:49,829
- Board and search it.
- It's just a fuckin' boat.

1234
01:35:49,937 --> 01:35:51,871
- There ain't nothin' on it.
- Board it and search it.

1235
01:35:51,972 --> 01:35:55,203
Just some baskets and
some ducks, fuckin' bananas.

1236
01:35:55,309 --> 01:35:57,140
- Ain't nothin' on it.
- Chef?

1237
01:35:57,244 --> 01:36:01,044
- What's wrong? Search it.
- There's the goat and some fish.

1238
01:36:01,148 --> 01:36:03,048
- Chef!
- Fuckin' vegetables-

1239
01:36:03,150 --> 01:36:05,050
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothin' on it, man!

1240
01:36:05,152 --> 01:36:06,676
- Get on it!
- All right!

1241
01:36:06,787 --> 01:36:10,086
Move it, asshole!
Goddamn it!

1242
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:12,454
Just some pigs! Look, mangoes!

1243
01:36:12,559 --> 01:36:15,050
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fuckin' rice!

1244
01:36:15,162 --> 01:36:17,596
- Look in there!
- Some fuckin' fish!

1245
01:36:17,698 --> 01:36:22,761
More coconuts.
Rice. Here's rice.

1246
01:36:22,869 --> 01:36:25,064
- What's in that vegetable basket?
- Get out of here!

1247
01:36:25,172 --> 01:36:27,072
Come on!

1248
01:36:27,174 --> 01:36:29,233
Check that vegetable basket!

1249
01:36:29,343 --> 01:36:31,243
- All right!
- Shut up, slope!

1250
01:36:31,345 --> 01:36:34,405
- There ain't nothin' in here!
- What's in the boxes?

1251
01:36:34,514 --> 01:36:36,277
- Look in that rusty can.
- Nothing!

1252
01:36:36,383 --> 01:36:39,181
Just fuckin' rice!
There ain't nothin' on it!

1253
01:36:39,286 --> 01:36:42,449
Check the yellow can!
She was sittin' on it. What's in it?

1254
01:36:45,792 --> 01:36:48,226
Chef!

1255
01:36:51,231 --> 01:36:54,462
Motherfuckers!

1256
01:36:56,803 --> 01:36:59,567
Motherfuckers!

1257
01:37:01,475 --> 01:37:04,967
- Hold it!
- Come on! Let's kill them all.

1258
01:37:05,078 --> 01:37:08,411
- Motherfucking cocksuckers mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!

1259
01:37:08,515 --> 01:37:10,676
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit outta all of 'em.

1260
01:37:10,784 --> 01:37:14,049
- Hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.

1261
01:37:14,154 --> 01:37:17,954
Why the fuck not?

1262
01:37:18,058 --> 01:37:21,289
- Clean?
- I'm good.

1263
01:37:28,068 --> 01:37:30,161
- You okay, Lance?
- Shit! Fuck! Shit!

1264
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:32,932
- Chef!
- Look what she was hiding!

1265
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:36,203
- You all right?
- See what she was runnin' for?

1266
01:37:38,812 --> 01:37:40,803
It's a fuckin' puppy.

1267
01:37:40,914 --> 01:37:43,781
It's a fuckin' puppy.

1268
01:37:43,884 --> 01:37:46,182
Give me that dog!

1269
01:37:46,286 --> 01:37:48,220
- Give me that dog!
- No! You're not gonna get it!

1270
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:51,586
- Give it to me!
- Give me the fuckin' dog, asshole!

1271
01:37:51,692 --> 01:37:54,786
Fuck you! Fuckin' mango too!

1272
01:37:54,895 --> 01:37:56,226
- Chef-
- You want that?

1273
01:37:56,329 --> 01:38:00,026
She's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

1274
01:38:00,133 --> 01:38:02,863
Chef! She's moving behind you.
Check her out!

1275
01:38:02,969 --> 01:38:06,461
All right. All right.
Come on, Clean! Goddamn it!

1276
01:38:06,573 --> 01:38:09,770
She's not dead. She's wounded.
Give him a hand.

1277
01:38:09,876 --> 01:38:11,867
Just take it easy.
Take it easy!

1278
01:38:11,978 --> 01:38:15,277
- Slow down and take it easy.
- Chef, wait a minute.

1279
01:38:15,382 --> 01:38:17,282
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing?

1280
01:38:17,384 --> 01:38:21,514
She's hurt. She's bleedin'.

1281
01:38:21,621 --> 01:38:24,021
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.

1282
01:38:24,124 --> 01:38:26,957
- What are you talking about?
- We're taking her to some friendlies.

1283
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:30,029
- She's wounded. She's not dead.
- Get out of there.

1284
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:31,324
The book says-

1285
01:38:42,175 --> 01:38:45,440
Fuck you. Fuck 'im.

1286
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:47,479
I told you not to stop.
Now let's go.

1287
01:39:46,017 --> 01:39:49,976
<i>It was a way we had over here
of living with ourselves.</i>

1288
01:39:50,088 --> 01:39:53,546
<i>We'd cut 'em in half with a
machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid.</i>

1289
01:39:55,694 --> 01:39:58,026
<i>It was a lie.</i>

1290
01:39:58,129 --> 01:40:00,757
<i>And the more I saw of them...</i>

1291
01:40:00,865 --> 01:40:03,095
<i>the more I hated lies.</i>

1292
01:40:05,003 --> 01:40:08,632
<i>Those boys were never gonna
look at me the same way again...</i>

1293
01:40:09,741 --> 01:40:14,337
<i>but I felt like I knew one or two things
about Kurtz that weren't in the dossier.</i>

1294
01:40:19,684 --> 01:40:23,745
<i>Do Lung Bridge was the last
army outpost on the Nung River.</i>

1295
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:30,457
<i>Beyond it,
there was only Kurtz.</i>

1296
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,700
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

1297
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:41,129
Huh? What's the matter with you?

1298
01:40:41,239 --> 01:40:43,707
You're acting kind of weird.

1299
01:40:43,808 --> 01:40:47,039
Hey, you know that last tab
of acid I was saving?

1300
01:40:48,146 --> 01:40:51,138
- I dropped it.
- You dropped acid?

1301
01:40:51,249 --> 01:40:52,648
Far out.

1302
01:40:54,786 --> 01:40:58,017
Friendly!
Friendly! Friendly!

1303
01:41:03,661 --> 01:41:04,958
Take me home!

1304
01:41:05,063 --> 01:41:06,963
Goddamn it!

1305
01:41:07,065 --> 01:41:10,193
- Fucking shore police! Shit!
- Man, you wanna die?

1306
01:41:10,301 --> 01:41:12,201
Don't keep goin'!

1307
01:41:14,606 --> 01:41:16,801
- You fuckin' police!
- Don't leave me!

1308
01:41:16,908 --> 01:41:19,035
Fuck you!

1309
01:41:19,144 --> 01:41:21,203
You'll get what you deserve!

1310
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:31,413
Is there a Captain Willard
on board?

1311
01:41:31,523 --> 01:41:33,457
- Yeah.
- Captain Willard?

1312
01:41:33,558 --> 01:41:36,925
- Yeah. Who's that?
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.

1313
01:41:37,028 --> 01:41:39,724
Get that light off me!

1314
01:41:39,831 --> 01:41:42,800
I was sent here from Nha Trang
with these three days ago, sir.

1315
01:41:42,901 --> 01:41:46,359
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

1316
01:41:46,471 --> 01:41:48,837
- Don't know how happy this makes me.
- Why?

1317
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:51,568
Now I can get out of here,
if I can find a way.

1318
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:58,816
You're in the asshole
of the world, Captain.

1319
01:42:03,121 --> 01:42:04,952
Captain, where you going?

1320
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:08,822
See if I can find some fuel
and get some information.

1321
01:42:08,927 --> 01:42:11,054
Pick me up at the other side
of the bridge.

1322
01:42:11,162 --> 01:42:13,187
Somebody go with him. Chef.

1323
01:42:13,298 --> 01:42:15,163
I'll go.

1324
01:42:15,266 --> 01:42:16,858
I wanna go.

1325
01:43:09,354 --> 01:43:11,845
Man, listen
to the music, man.

1326
01:43:11,956 --> 01:43:13,856
Where can I find the CO?

1327
01:43:13,958 --> 01:43:15,858
You came right to it,
son of a bitch!

1328
01:43:18,162 --> 01:43:20,596
Get down here!

1329
01:43:21,866 --> 01:43:25,029
You still got
a commanding officer here?

1330
01:43:25,136 --> 01:43:27,764
- Beverly Hills.
- What?

1331
01:43:27,872 --> 01:43:32,434
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills!

1332
01:43:32,543 --> 01:43:35,740
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

1333
01:44:10,448 --> 01:44:13,440
- Goddamn it! You stepped in my face.
- I thought you were dead.

1334
01:44:13,551 --> 01:44:15,781
Well, you thought wrong,
damn it!

1335
01:44:19,157 --> 01:44:21,352
I told you to stop fucking
with me, didn't I?

1336
01:44:21,459 --> 01:44:23,086
You think you're so bad,
huh, nigger?

1337
01:44:23,194 --> 01:44:25,219
What are you shooting at, soldier?

1338
01:44:25,330 --> 01:44:27,389
What the fuck
ya think I'm shootin' at?

1339
01:44:27,498 --> 01:44:30,262
I'm sorry, sir. There are gooks
out there by the wire.

1340
01:44:30,368 --> 01:44:32,063
But I think I killed them all.

1341
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:34,263
You ain't shot shit. Listen.

1342
01:44:35,907 --> 01:44:38,933
Oh, shit. He's trying to call
his friends. Send up a flare.

1343
01:44:47,352 --> 01:44:49,650
Think you so bad, huh, nigger?
You think you bad, huh?

1344
01:44:49,754 --> 01:44:51,153
They're all dead, stupid.

1345
01:44:51,255 --> 01:44:54,315
There's one still alive
underneath them bodies.

1346
01:44:54,425 --> 01:44:55,915
Who's the commanding
officer here?

1347
01:44:57,095 --> 01:44:59,029
Ain't you?

1348
01:45:00,732 --> 01:45:02,290
You think you so bad?

1349
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:06,860
I got something for your ass now,
nigger! I got something for you now!

1350
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:10,698
He's underneath the bodies, man.

1351
01:45:12,076 --> 01:45:14,271
Go get the Roach for me.

1352
01:45:14,379 --> 01:45:17,974
Go get the Roach, nigger!
Go get the Roach.

1353
01:45:22,387 --> 01:45:24,719
Roach. Roach.

1354
01:45:27,325 --> 01:45:29,293
Got slopes on the wire, man.
You hear 'em?

1355
01:45:30,228 --> 01:45:31,786
Do you hear 'em?

1356
01:45:34,098 --> 01:45:36,726
Fuck you, GI!

1357
01:45:36,834 --> 01:45:38,392
We'll bust 'em!

1358
01:45:41,139 --> 01:45:43,801
Hey, GI, fuck you!

1359
01:45:47,912 --> 01:45:49,641
Fuck you, GI!

1360
01:45:50,748 --> 01:45:53,308
Fuck you, GI!

1361
01:45:53,418 --> 01:45:55,579
Hear him out there
on the wire, man?

1362
01:45:58,222 --> 01:46:01,020
- I kill you, GI!
- You need a flare?

1363
01:46:05,863 --> 01:46:09,765
He's close, man.
He's real close.

1364
01:46:17,341 --> 01:46:20,833
Fuck you, GI!
I kill you!

1365
01:46:25,316 --> 01:46:27,216
Fuck you, GI!

1366
01:46:32,056 --> 01:46:34,024
GI, fuck you!

1367
01:46:36,227 --> 01:46:38,923
GI! GI-

1368
01:46:44,569 --> 01:46:45,900
Motherfucker.

1369
01:46:47,004 --> 01:46:48,562
Hey, soldier.

1370
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:54,875
Do you know who's
in command here?

1371
01:47:13,064 --> 01:47:15,555
Holy shit.

1372
01:47:20,204 --> 01:47:23,173
Hey, Chief, man. Two guys
just got blown off that bridge.

1373
01:47:23,274 --> 01:47:26,072
You hang on, man.
You're gonna be okay.

1374
01:47:30,114 --> 01:47:31,979
- What's that?
- Mail, man. Mail.

1375
01:47:32,083 --> 01:47:34,608
Later on the mail.
Watch them trees.

1376
01:47:36,854 --> 01:47:39,618
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1377
01:47:39,724 --> 01:47:41,385
Let's move out.

1378
01:47:41,492 --> 01:47:45,223
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fucking CO here.

1379
01:47:47,298 --> 01:47:49,562
Let's just get goin'.

1380
01:47:49,667 --> 01:47:51,567
Which way, Captain?

1381
01:47:57,241 --> 01:48:00,005
You know which way, Chief.

1382
01:48:00,111 --> 01:48:02,841
You're on your own, Captain.

1383
01:48:02,947 --> 01:48:04,346
Still wanna go on?

1384
01:48:04,448 --> 01:48:06,040
It's like this bridge.

1385
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:09,278
We build it every night, Charlie
blows it right back up again...

1386
01:48:09,387 --> 01:48:11,878
just so the generals
can say the road's open.

1387
01:48:11,989 --> 01:48:13,718
Think about it.

1388
01:48:17,228 --> 01:48:19,992
- Who cares?
- Just get us upriver!

1389
01:48:24,268 --> 01:48:26,532
Chef, on the bow.

1390
01:48:27,772 --> 01:48:29,899
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go!

1391
01:49:21,892 --> 01:49:26,226
You got one, Miller.
Geez, I got some too.

1392
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:27,888
Whose package is that?

1393
01:49:27,999 --> 01:49:31,298
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit? Wait a minute.

1394
01:49:31,402 --> 01:49:34,030
- Is that it?
- That's it for you. Lance.

1395
01:49:34,872 --> 01:49:38,638
Mr. L. B. Johnson,
there you go.

1396
01:49:38,743 --> 01:49:42,235
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waitin' for this one.

1397
01:49:42,346 --> 01:49:45,645
I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.

1398
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:48,184
"Lance.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1399
01:49:48,286 --> 01:49:51,847
Sue and I went tripping in Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."

1400
01:49:51,956 --> 01:49:54,322
Man, I wanna get back
to Antoine's.

1401
01:49:54,425 --> 01:49:58,725
"I remember the time we went up to-"
How could I fucking forget? Beautiful.

1402
01:49:58,829 --> 01:50:01,559
"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?

1403
01:50:01,666 --> 01:50:02,860
Let me know."

1404
01:50:02,967 --> 01:50:06,300
Jim, it's here.
It really is here.

1405
01:50:10,841 --> 01:50:13,401
<i>"There has been a new development
regarding your mission...</i>

1406
01:50:13,511 --> 01:50:15,843
<i>which we must now
communicate to you.</i>

1407
01:50:15,946 --> 01:50:19,382
<i>Months ago, a man was ordered on
a mission which was identical to yours.</i>

1408
01:50:20,251 --> 01:50:23,914
<i>We have reason to believe that he
is now operating with Col. Kurtz.</i>

1409
01:50:25,623 --> 01:50:29,115
<i>Saigon was carrying him MIA
for his family's sake...</i>

1410
01:50:29,226 --> 01:50:31,660
<i>but they assumed he was dead.</i>

1411
01:50:31,762 --> 01:50:35,755
<i>Then they intercepted a letter
he tried to send to his wife."</i>

1412
01:50:39,203 --> 01:50:41,103
<i>Captain Richard Colby.</i>

1413
01:50:43,274 --> 01:50:45,708
<i>He was with Kurtz.</i>

1414
01:50:45,810 --> 01:50:48,301
Disneyland.

1415
01:50:48,412 --> 01:50:50,972
Fuck, man, this is better
than Disneyland.

1416
01:50:51,082 --> 01:50:55,519
"Charles Miller Manson ordered
the slaughter of all in the home...

1417
01:50:55,619 --> 01:50:57,644
anyway as a symbol of protest."

1418
01:50:57,755 --> 01:51:00,189
That's really weird,
ain't it?

1419
01:51:00,291 --> 01:51:03,522
- Purple haze. Look, man.
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1420
01:51:03,627 --> 01:51:06,892
- I got a tape from my mom.
- Rainbow reality, man.

1421
01:51:06,997 --> 01:51:10,364
Hey, Chief,
get a good whiff.

1422
01:51:10,468 --> 01:51:13,232
Eva can't picture me
in Vietnam.

1423
01:51:13,337 --> 01:51:16,704
She pictures me at home
having a beer watching TV.

1424
01:51:18,142 --> 01:51:19,439
Hey, Lance, man.

1425
01:51:19,543 --> 01:51:21,875
Oh, hot potato,
hot potato.

1426
01:51:21,979 --> 01:51:24,846
<i>I'm so glad you decided
to join the navy.</i>

1427
01:51:24,949 --> 01:51:28,282
Eva's not sure she can have
a relationship with me, you know.

1428
01:51:28,386 --> 01:51:31,116
Here I am,
13,000 fucking miles away...

1429
01:51:31,222 --> 01:51:34,316
trying to keep a relationship
with my ass.

1430
01:51:34,425 --> 01:51:38,156
<i>That's much more than I can say
for some of your friends.</i>

1431
01:51:38,262 --> 01:51:40,253
<i>If this tape is any good...</i>

1432
01:51:40,364 --> 01:51:44,528
<i>I will have Dad and the family
send you a tape of their own.</i>

1433
01:51:56,947 --> 01:51:58,312
Fuckers!

1434
01:52:03,721 --> 01:52:05,882
There! Over there!

1435
01:52:07,725 --> 01:52:09,625
Motherfuckers!

1436
01:52:20,337 --> 01:52:22,237
There. Over there!

1437
01:52:31,482 --> 01:52:35,543
Chef, check out Clean!
Captain, he's hit. Clean's hit.

1438
01:52:35,653 --> 01:52:37,951
Where'd the dog go?

1439
01:52:38,055 --> 01:52:41,149
Lance! Lance!
They got Clean.

1440
01:52:41,258 --> 01:52:44,887
Where's the dog?
We gotta go back and get the dog.

1441
01:52:44,995 --> 01:52:48,158
Hey, Clean. Hey.

1442
01:52:48,265 --> 01:52:50,631
Hey, bubba.

1443
01:52:50,734 --> 01:52:52,725
Bubba, you can't die,
you fucker!

1444
01:52:54,638 --> 01:52:56,196
Hey, bubba.

1445
01:52:56,307 --> 01:53:01,609
<i>And so I'm hoping that-
pretty soon- not too soon-</i>

1446
01:53:01,712 --> 01:53:06,149
<i>but pretty soon I'll have a lot
of grandchildren to love and spoil.</i>

1447
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:09,913
<i>And then when your wife get 'em back,
she'll be mad with me.</i>

1448
01:53:12,156 --> 01:53:14,488
<i>Even Aunt Jessie and Mama...</i>

1449
01:53:14,592 --> 01:53:17,891
<i>will come to celebrate
your coming home.</i>

1450
01:53:17,995 --> 01:53:21,522
<i>Granny and Dad are trying to get
enough money to get you a car...</i>

1451
01:53:21,632 --> 01:53:26,228
<i>but don't tell 'em
because that's our secret.</i>

1452
01:53:26,337 --> 01:53:29,067
<i>Anyhow, do the right thing...</i>

1453
01:53:29,173 --> 01:53:31,539
<i>stay out of the way
of the bullets...</i>

1454
01:53:31,642 --> 01:53:35,738
<i>and bring your heinie home
all in one piece...</i>

1455
01:53:35,846 --> 01:53:38,110
<i>because we love you
very much.</i>

1456
01:53:38,215 --> 01:53:40,115
<i>Love, Mom.</i>

1457
01:55:14,044 --> 01:55:15,705
Hold on.

1458
01:55:18,082 --> 01:55:19,982
Throw me the glasses.

1459
01:55:32,229 --> 01:55:34,891
Lance, take a 16 on the bow.

1460
01:55:37,601 --> 01:55:41,230
Chef. Chef.
On the 60.

1461
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:04,518
Fuck me.

1462
01:57:13,564 --> 01:57:16,032
Cover the captain. Lance.

1463
01:57:16,133 --> 01:57:18,033
Cover the captain.

1464
01:57:35,319 --> 01:57:36,946
They're French.
They're French.

1465
01:57:39,389 --> 01:57:42,153
Pick up that weapon!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1466
01:57:42,259 --> 01:57:43,817
Stand fast. Captain.

1467
01:58:18,629 --> 01:58:21,189
All right, you men.
Put down your weapons.

1468
01:59:16,119 --> 01:59:18,019
We lost one of our men.

1469
01:59:21,758 --> 01:59:25,854
We French always pay respect
to the dead of our allies.

1470
01:59:28,732 --> 01:59:30,632
You're all welcome.

1471
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:35,261
My name is Hubert DeMarais.

1472
01:59:36,907 --> 01:59:39,774
This is my family's plantation.

1473
01:59:39,877 --> 01:59:42,937
It has been such
for 70 years.

1474
01:59:44,047 --> 01:59:47,380
And it will be such
until we are all dead.

1475
02:01:58,915 --> 02:02:02,407
Captain, accept the flag
of Tyrone Miller...

1476
02:02:02,519 --> 02:02:05,010
on behalf of
a grateful nation.

1477
02:02:25,142 --> 02:02:28,009
This food is really wonderful,
isn't it? The wine, the sauces.

1478
02:02:28,111 --> 02:02:31,638
I can't believe it.
Hey, can I speak with the chef?

1479
02:02:31,748 --> 02:02:33,978
The chef speak
only Vietnamese.

1480
02:02:34,084 --> 02:02:37,850
No kidding? He cooks like this
and he can't even speak French?

1481
02:02:37,954 --> 02:02:41,014
Hey, Lance,
the chef's a slope.

1482
02:03:13,356 --> 02:03:17,019
This is Baudelaire.
It's a very cruel poem for children.

1483
02:03:17,127 --> 02:03:20,995
But they need it, 'cause
life sometimes is very cruel.

1484
02:03:22,099 --> 02:03:23,999
As you can see.

1485
02:03:27,737 --> 02:03:29,864
Attack repels by the family.

1486
02:03:29,973 --> 02:03:31,998
Just for this war.

1487
02:03:32,109 --> 02:03:36,546
Vietcong, 58.
North Vietnamese, 12.

1488
02:03:36,646 --> 02:03:39,774
South Vietnamese, 11.

1489
02:03:39,883 --> 02:03:41,817
Americans, six?

1490
02:03:43,153 --> 02:03:46,520
Yes. Well, there were
perhaps mistakes.

1491
02:04:07,410 --> 02:04:10,072
May I present Captain Willard.
He is of a paratroop regiment.

1492
02:04:10,180 --> 02:04:12,341
Madame Sarrault.

1493
02:04:12,449 --> 02:04:13,848
Captain.

1494
02:04:40,544 --> 02:04:42,774
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.
It was just a little story...

1495
02:04:42,879 --> 02:04:45,245
about Paris and people
starving during the war.

1496
02:04:45,348 --> 02:04:48,044
They are all around the table, and
there was a silence and somebody say...

1497
02:04:48,151 --> 02:04:50,176
"An angel is passing by."

1498
02:04:50,287 --> 02:04:53,552
So somebody said,
"Let's eat it."

1499
02:04:53,657 --> 02:04:54,988
Oh.

1500
02:05:00,597 --> 02:05:04,328
How long can you
possibly stay here?

1501
02:05:04,434 --> 02:05:07,062
We stay forever.

1502
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:09,070
No, no. I mean...

1503
02:05:10,307 --> 02:05:12,298
why don't you go
back home to France?

1504
02:05:13,343 --> 02:05:17,302
- Back home?
- I mean, this is our home, Captain.

1505
02:05:17,414 --> 02:05:19,006
Sooner or later, you're-

1506
02:05:21,818 --> 02:05:23,945
You don't understand
our mentality-

1507
02:05:24,054 --> 02:05:26,454
the French officer mentality!

1508
02:05:26,556 --> 02:05:28,786
At first, we lose
in Second World War.

1509
02:05:28,892 --> 02:05:31,918
I don't say that you
Americans win, but we lose.

1510
02:05:32,028 --> 02:05:33,052
Oh, Papa-

1511
02:05:34,164 --> 02:05:36,997
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose.
In Algeria, we lose.

1512
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:39,500
In Indochina, we lose!

1513
02:05:39,603 --> 02:05:42,333
But here we don't lose!

1514
02:05:42,439 --> 02:05:45,431
This piece of earth,
we keep it.

1515
02:05:45,542 --> 02:05:47,442
We will never lose it.
Never!

1516
02:05:53,250 --> 02:05:55,081
You Americans.

1517
02:05:56,519 --> 02:06:00,956
In 1945, yeah...

1518
02:06:01,057 --> 02:06:05,585
after the Japanese war,
your President Roosevelt...

1519
02:06:05,695 --> 02:06:08,926
didn't want the French people
to stay in Indochina.

1520
02:06:10,567 --> 02:06:12,535
So...

1521
02:06:12,636 --> 02:06:15,605
you Americans implant
the Vietminh.

1522
02:06:17,307 --> 02:06:18,535
What's he mean?

1523
02:06:18,642 --> 02:06:22,078
Yeah, that's true. The Vietcong
were invented by the Americans.

1524
02:06:23,213 --> 02:06:24,441
The Americans?

1525
02:06:25,315 --> 02:06:27,806
And now you take
the French place...

1526
02:06:27,917 --> 02:06:30,078
and the Vietminh fight you.

1527
02:06:30,186 --> 02:06:32,086
And what can you do?

1528
02:06:32,188 --> 02:06:34,520
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

1529
02:06:34,624 --> 02:06:38,185
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.

1530
02:06:38,295 --> 02:06:42,026
The Russian ones who help them,
"Come and give us their money.

1531
02:06:42,132 --> 02:06:45,966
We are all Communists. Chinese,
give us guns. We are all brothers."

1532
02:06:46,069 --> 02:06:48,003
They hate the Chinese!

1533
02:06:48,104 --> 02:06:52,973
Maybe they hate the American
less than the Russian and the Chinese.

1534
02:06:53,076 --> 02:06:55,306
I mean, if tomorrow
the Vietnamese are Communists...

1535
02:06:55,412 --> 02:06:57,312
they will be Vietnamese Communists.

1536
02:06:57,414 --> 02:07:00,008
And this is something that you
never understood, you American.

1537
02:07:00,116 --> 02:07:02,016
I don't know.

1538
02:07:02,118 --> 02:07:05,610
Maybe in the future we can make
something with the Vietminh.

1539
02:07:05,722 --> 02:07:07,849
Don't you understand?

1540
02:07:07,957 --> 02:07:10,755
The VC say,
"Go away. Go away."

1541
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:13,385
That's finish for all
the white people in Indochina.

1542
02:07:13,496 --> 02:07:16,761
If you're French, American,
that's all the same.

1543
02:07:16,866 --> 02:07:20,427
"Go." They want to forget you.
Look, Captain.

1544
02:07:22,806 --> 02:07:25,866
Look, this is the truth.
An egg.

1545
02:07:28,311 --> 02:07:29,539
The white left...

1546
02:07:31,314 --> 02:07:34,408
but the yellow stays!

1547
02:07:41,591 --> 02:07:45,459
When I was in Saigon,
I spoke to an American politician.

1548
02:07:45,562 --> 02:07:48,554
He explained it very well.
He said, "Look.

1549
02:07:48,665 --> 02:07:51,828
Yesterday, it was Korea.
Today, Vietnam.

1550
02:07:51,935 --> 02:07:54,529
Tomorrow, Thailand,
the Philippines...

1551
02:07:54,637 --> 02:07:57,299
then maybe Europe."

1552
02:07:57,407 --> 02:08:00,467
Come on. Why not Europe?

1553
02:08:00,577 --> 02:08:02,875
Look what happened
in Czechoslovakia recently.

1554
02:08:02,979 --> 02:08:06,574
Even before Second World War Americans
knew exactly what was going on.

1555
02:08:06,683 --> 02:08:10,346
They don't want
that shit to take over! LeFevre!

1556
02:08:11,955 --> 02:08:14,116
All you white people are shit.

1557
02:08:14,224 --> 02:08:16,692
They are fighting-
fighting for freedom.

1558
02:08:16,793 --> 02:08:19,057
Freedom? Bullshit.

1559
02:08:19,162 --> 02:08:21,995
French bullshit.
American bullshit.

1560
02:08:22,098 --> 02:08:24,464
Dien Bien Phu,
that serious.

1561
02:08:24,567 --> 02:08:28,435
All soldiers know
they are already dead.

1562
02:08:29,639 --> 02:08:31,732
You know anything
about Dien Bien Phu?

1563
02:08:34,911 --> 02:08:36,811
- Yeah, I know.
- No, you don't.

1564
02:08:38,081 --> 02:08:40,811
- Not really.
- Dien Bien Phu was an error.

1565
02:08:40,917 --> 02:08:42,179
A military mistake.

1566
02:08:42,285 --> 02:08:44,617
A mistake?
A voluntary mistake!

1567
02:08:44,721 --> 02:08:46,348
Voluntary!

1568
02:08:48,458 --> 02:08:52,360
All the soldiers knew.
We knew we would be dead.

1569
02:08:52,462 --> 02:08:55,590
The generals and the colonels believe
it's impossible for the Viets...

1570
02:08:55,698 --> 02:08:58,394
to get the cannon
up there in the mountains.

1571
02:08:58,501 --> 02:09:02,733
But they do. Then they wait
for the rain to come.

1572
02:09:04,274 --> 02:09:08,938
When it comes,
no airplane can fly there.

1573
02:09:09,045 --> 02:09:11,377
And our paratroopers
jump at 90 meters.

1574
02:09:11,481 --> 02:09:14,575
I mean, you know,
90 meters- 70 meters.

1575
02:09:14,684 --> 02:09:17,346
I mean, that's crazy.
No army in the world can do that.

1576
02:09:17,454 --> 02:09:21,151
And they only do that
to be dead with their friends.

1577
02:09:27,897 --> 02:09:30,092
The French Army was sacrificed.

1578
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:32,691
Sacrificed by the politicians
safe at home.

1579
02:09:32,802 --> 02:09:35,600
They put the army in an impossible
situation where they couldn't win.

1580
02:09:35,705 --> 02:09:38,435
The students are
marching in Paris...

1581
02:09:38,541 --> 02:09:40,441
protesting, demonstrating.

1582
02:09:40,543 --> 02:09:42,807
They stab the soldiers
in their back.

1583
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:46,643
The soldier would open
the grenade, it wouldn't work.

1584
02:09:46,749 --> 02:09:50,845
A piece of paper would fall-

1585
02:09:50,954 --> 02:09:54,151
"Union of French Women."
"We are for the Viets."

1586
02:09:54,257 --> 02:09:57,920
Traitors!
Communist traitors at home.

1587
02:09:59,796 --> 02:10:02,356
Dien Bien Phu, okay.

1588
02:10:02,465 --> 02:10:06,367
The French is shit, huh?

1589
02:10:06,469 --> 02:10:08,733
No one care.
No one want-

1590
02:10:11,374 --> 02:10:14,571
Why don't you Americans
learn from us, from our mistakes?

1591
02:10:14,677 --> 02:10:16,577
<i>Mon Dieux, with your army,
your strength...</i>

1592
02:10:16,679 --> 02:10:18,943
your power, you could win
if you want to!

1593
02:10:21,384 --> 02:10:23,614
You can win.

1594
02:10:27,023 --> 02:10:30,424
You know, I'm sure
we can make something here.

1595
02:10:30,527 --> 02:10:32,427
I'm sure about it,
you know?

1596
02:10:32,529 --> 02:10:35,965
I never do something wrong
to the people here.

1597
02:10:36,065 --> 02:10:38,590
That's right, but the Communist
at home have never been traitors.

1598
02:11:04,227 --> 02:11:06,889
- Communist!
- Socialist!

1599
02:11:15,038 --> 02:11:18,496
<i>Capitaine, good night.
He was a Socialist, you know.</i>

1600
02:11:18,608 --> 02:11:22,738
We can stay. I know
that we can stay. We can.

1601
02:11:26,282 --> 02:11:29,683
You know, we always
helped the people.

1602
02:11:29,786 --> 02:11:31,686
We work with the people.

1603
02:11:32,789 --> 02:11:36,020
So we can be friends,
we are agreed.

1604
02:11:48,104 --> 02:11:52,006
See, Captain,
when my grandfather...

1605
02:11:53,776 --> 02:11:56,677
and my uncle's father
came here...

1606
02:11:58,648 --> 02:12:01,276
there was nothing-
nothing.

1607
02:12:02,385 --> 02:12:05,081
The Vietnamese were nothing.

1608
02:12:06,823 --> 02:12:09,189
So we worked hard...

1609
02:12:09,292 --> 02:12:11,226
very hard, and brought...

1610
02:12:11,327 --> 02:12:14,922
the rubber from Brazil,
and then plant it here.

1611
02:12:16,099 --> 02:12:19,227
We took the Vietnamese,
work with them...

1612
02:12:20,136 --> 02:12:22,001
make something-

1613
02:12:22,105 --> 02:12:24,835
something out of nothing.

1614
02:12:24,941 --> 02:12:29,378
So when you ask me why
we want to stay here, Captain...

1615
02:12:30,980 --> 02:12:35,076
we want to stay here because
it's ours- it belongs to us.

1616
02:12:35,184 --> 02:12:37,084
It keeps our family together.

1617
02:12:38,988 --> 02:12:40,888
I mean, we fight for that.

1618
02:12:42,992 --> 02:12:47,326
While you Americans,
you are fighting for...

1619
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:51,389
the biggest nothing in history.

1620
02:12:58,608 --> 02:13:03,477
I'm sorry, Captain. I will see
if your men need any help to...

1621
02:13:03,579 --> 02:13:05,672
repair your boat...

1622
02:13:05,782 --> 02:13:08,808
so that you can go on
with your war.

1623
02:13:44,487 --> 02:13:47,388
I apologize
for my family, Captain.

1624
02:13:48,958 --> 02:13:51,256
We have all lost much here.

1625
02:13:52,495 --> 02:13:55,293
Hubert- his wife
and two sons.

1626
02:14:00,169 --> 02:14:02,399
And I have lost a husband.

1627
02:14:08,244 --> 02:14:10,007
I understand.

1628
02:14:10,113 --> 02:14:12,638
You are tired of the war.

1629
02:14:14,317 --> 02:14:16,877
I can see it in your face.

1630
02:14:18,888 --> 02:14:22,949
'Twas the same in the eyes
of the soldiers of our war.

1631
02:14:24,427 --> 02:14:28,124
<i>We called them
"Les Soldats Perdus-"</i>

1632
02:14:28,231 --> 02:14:30,461
The Lost Soldiers.

1633
02:14:35,171 --> 02:14:37,696
If you like,
we can have some cognac.

1634
02:14:44,881 --> 02:14:47,975
I have to-
to see about my men and-

1635
02:14:55,224 --> 02:14:58,125
The war will be
still here tomorrow.

1636
02:15:08,371 --> 02:15:10,601
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1637
02:15:18,648 --> 02:15:21,378
I noticed you had
no wine at dinner.

1638
02:15:22,485 --> 02:15:25,579
No, I don't drink wine.

1639
02:15:28,624 --> 02:15:32,720
I do like cognac, but I don't want
any now. Thank you.

1640
02:15:34,030 --> 02:15:36,464
Well...

1641
02:15:36,566 --> 02:15:39,626
then I-
I must drink alone.

1642
02:15:49,879 --> 02:15:53,076
Will you go back
after the war to America?

1643
02:15:58,754 --> 02:16:02,212
Then you're like us-
your home is here.

1644
02:16:19,642 --> 02:16:23,544
Do you know why you can never step
into the same river twice?

1645
02:16:25,781 --> 02:16:29,342
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving.

1646
02:16:30,486 --> 02:16:34,354
I used to prepare
a pipe for my husband.

1647
02:16:40,763 --> 02:16:45,063
'Twas the morphine he took for
the wounds he suffered in his heart.

1648
02:16:48,404 --> 02:16:52,568
He would rage and he would cry,
my lost soldier.

1649
02:16:56,212 --> 02:17:00,171
And I said to him,
"There are two of you.

1650
02:17:00,283 --> 02:17:02,911
Don't you see?

1651
02:17:03,019 --> 02:17:06,921
One that kills
and one that loves."

1652
02:17:08,858 --> 02:17:11,053
And he said to me...

1653
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:15,893
"I don't know whether
I'm an animal or a god."

1654
02:17:18,401 --> 02:17:20,301
But you are both.

1655
02:18:02,278 --> 02:18:04,178
You want more?

1656
02:18:09,585 --> 02:18:13,316
All that matters
is that you're alive.

1657
02:18:15,024 --> 02:18:17,788
You are alive, Captain.

1658
02:18:21,364 --> 02:18:23,594
That's the truth.

1659
02:19:36,705 --> 02:19:39,538
There are two of you,
don't you see?

1660
02:19:41,577 --> 02:19:44,068
One that kills...

1661
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:46,546
and one that loves.

1662
02:20:15,077 --> 02:20:17,978
Can't see nothing.
We stoppin'.

1663
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:20,640
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

1664
02:20:20,749 --> 02:20:24,241
I said I can't see a thing, Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.

1665
02:20:24,353 --> 02:20:26,253
I ain't riskin'
no more lives.

1666
02:20:26,355 --> 02:20:29,085
I'm in command here, goddamn it.
You'll do what I say.

1667
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:32,760
You see anything, Chef?

1668
02:20:35,131 --> 02:20:37,861
Why don't they
fucking attack, man?

1669
02:20:56,385 --> 02:20:58,512
Watch it over here, Chief.

1670
02:20:59,488 --> 02:21:01,456
Got a stump.

1671
02:21:04,326 --> 02:21:06,021
On the fifties.

1672
02:21:06,128 --> 02:21:08,528
<i>He was close.</i>

1673
02:21:09,965 --> 02:21:12,126
<i>He was real close.</i>

1674
02:21:13,235 --> 02:21:16,693
<i>I couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him...</i>

1675
02:21:16,805 --> 02:21:18,773
<i>as if the boat were being
sucked upriver...</i>

1676
02:21:18,874 --> 02:21:21,707
<i>and the water was
flowing back into the jungle.</i>

1677
02:21:24,246 --> 02:21:26,146
<i>Whatever was going to happen...</i>

1678
02:21:26,248 --> 02:21:30,150
<i>it wasn't going to be the way
they called it back in Nha Trang.</i>

1679
02:21:35,257 --> 02:21:37,623
- Arrows!
- Fire!

1680
02:21:39,962 --> 02:21:42,829
Chef, open up! Fire!

1681
02:21:46,001 --> 02:21:48,299
Lance, fire!

1682
02:21:56,045 --> 02:22:00,004
Chef! Chef, it's okay.
Quit firing.

1683
02:22:00,115 --> 02:22:03,778
- They're just little toy arrows.
- Cut it out! Quiet!

1684
02:22:03,886 --> 02:22:06,855
Chief, tell them
to hold their fire!

1685
02:22:06,956 --> 02:22:09,516
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1686
02:22:09,625 --> 02:22:11,616
Quiet!

1687
02:22:11,727 --> 02:22:14,628
You got us into this mess,
and now you can't get us out...

1688
02:22:14,730 --> 02:22:17,198
because you don't know where
the hell you're going, do ya?

1689
02:22:17,299 --> 02:22:19,426
Do ya?

1690
02:22:19,535 --> 02:22:22,698
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!

1691
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:26,504
Lance, get the wheel!

1692
02:22:26,609 --> 02:22:30,841
You savages! Come and get it!
You son of a bitches!

1693
02:22:51,133 --> 02:22:52,691
A spear?

1694
02:24:12,247 --> 02:24:15,410
My mission is to make it
up into Cambodia.

1695
02:24:15,517 --> 02:24:18,452
There's a Green Beret colonel
up there who's gone insane...

1696
02:24:18,554 --> 02:24:19,953
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1697
02:24:21,423 --> 02:24:24,358
That's fucking typical!
Shit!

1698
02:24:24,460 --> 02:24:26,724
Fuckin' Vietnam mission!

1699
02:24:26,829 --> 02:24:30,526
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1700
02:24:30,632 --> 02:24:34,329
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.

1701
02:24:34,436 --> 02:24:38,600
Shit!
That's fuckin' crazy.

1702
02:24:38,707 --> 02:24:41,676
I mean, I thought you were
going in to blow up a bridge...

1703
02:24:41,777 --> 02:24:45,076
or some fuckin'
railroad tracks or somethin'.

1704
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:47,648
- That's all right.
- No. No, wait. Wait.

1705
02:24:47,750 --> 02:24:51,117
We'll go together, on the boat.
We'll go with you.

1706
02:24:51,220 --> 02:24:55,623
We'll go up there,
but on the boat. Okay?

1707
02:26:01,690 --> 02:26:04,181
<i>Part of me was afraid
of what I would find...</i>

1708
02:26:04,293 --> 02:26:06,693
<i>and what I would do
when I got there.</i>

1709
02:26:08,664 --> 02:26:11,497
<i>I knew the risks...</i>

1710
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:13,898
<i>or imagined I knew.</i>

1711
02:26:15,838 --> 02:26:18,398
<i>But the thing
I felt the most...</i>

1712
02:26:18,507 --> 02:26:21,601
<i>much stronger than fear...</i>

1713
02:26:21,710 --> 02:26:24,440
<i>was the desire to confront him.</i>

1714
02:27:36,251 --> 02:27:38,310
Just keep movin'.

1715
02:27:38,420 --> 02:27:42,550
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.

1716
02:29:09,344 --> 02:29:11,938
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

1717
02:29:13,315 --> 02:29:16,341
I ain't comin' in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1718
02:29:16,451 --> 02:29:20,945
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man.
Zap 'em with your siren.

1719
02:29:31,166 --> 02:29:33,430
There's mines over there
and mines over there too.

1720
02:29:33,535 --> 02:29:36,732
And watch out. Those goddamn
monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.

1721
02:29:36,838 --> 02:29:40,035
Ah, that's a pretty one.
Move it right in towards me.

1722
02:29:40,142 --> 02:29:41,905
I'm an American.

1723
02:29:42,010 --> 02:29:44,808
Yeah. An American civilian.
Hi, Yanks.

1724
02:29:44,913 --> 02:29:47,404
Hi. American.

1725
02:29:47,516 --> 02:29:49,609
American civilian.
It's all right.

1726
02:29:49,718 --> 02:29:53,586
And you got the cigarettes. And that's
what I've been dreaming about.

1727
02:29:55,590 --> 02:29:58,354
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1728
02:30:02,397 --> 02:30:04,024
I'm a photojournalist.

1729
02:30:04,132 --> 02:30:06,828
I've covered the war
since '64.

1730
02:30:06,935 --> 02:30:09,495
I've been in Laos,
Cambodia and 'Nam.

1731
02:30:12,841 --> 02:30:16,971
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing.
This boat is a mess, man.

1732
02:30:17,079 --> 02:30:19,343
Who are all these people?

1733
02:30:19,448 --> 02:30:23,248
Yeah, well, they think
you've come to-

1734
02:30:23,351 --> 02:30:24,682
to take him away.

1735
02:30:24,786 --> 02:30:27,949
- And I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?

1736
02:30:30,125 --> 02:30:33,424
Him! Col. Kurtz.

1737
02:30:33,528 --> 02:30:37,294
These are all his children,
man, as far as you can see.

1738
02:30:37,399 --> 02:30:41,096
Hell, man, out here
we're all his children.

1739
02:30:41,203 --> 02:30:44,866
Could we talk to Col. Kurtz?

1740
02:30:44,973 --> 02:30:49,205
Hey, mac.
You don't talk to the colonel.

1741
02:30:49,311 --> 02:30:51,211
Well, you listen to him.

1742
02:30:51,313 --> 02:30:54,578
The man's enlarged my mind.

1743
02:30:54,683 --> 02:30:58,380
He's a poet warrior
in the classic sense.

1744
02:30:58,487 --> 02:31:00,387
I mean, sometimes he'll-

1745
02:31:00,489 --> 02:31:02,081
Well, you say hello to him,
right?

1746
02:31:02,190 --> 02:31:04,590
He'll just walk by you
and he won't even notice you.

1747
02:31:04,693 --> 02:31:08,322
Then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll
throw you in a corner and he'll say...

1748
02:31:08,430 --> 02:31:10,421
"Do you know that 'if'
is the middle word in 'life'?

1749
02:31:10,532 --> 02:31:13,433
If you can keep your head when all about
you are losing theirs and blaming you.

1750
02:31:13,535 --> 02:31:15,867
If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you."

1751
02:31:15,971 --> 02:31:19,065
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.

1752
02:31:19,174 --> 02:31:22,302
"I should have been
a pair of ragged claws...

1753
02:31:22,410 --> 02:31:25,277
scuttling across floors
of silent seas."

1754
02:31:25,380 --> 02:31:27,610
- I mean-
- Stay with the boat.

1755
02:31:27,716 --> 02:31:32,153
Don't go any- Don't go without me,
okay? I wanna get a picture.

1756
02:31:33,922 --> 02:31:37,289
He can be terrible
and he can be mean...

1757
02:31:37,392 --> 02:31:39,292
and he can be right.

1758
02:31:39,394 --> 02:31:42,420
He's fighting the war.
He's a great man.

1759
02:31:45,834 --> 02:31:47,734
I mean-

1760
02:31:50,272 --> 02:31:53,799
I wish I had words, you know.
I wish I had words.

1761
02:31:53,909 --> 02:31:56,935
I could tell you something like,
the other day he wanted to kill me.

1762
02:31:57,045 --> 02:31:59,775
- Something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?

1763
02:31:59,881 --> 02:32:02,281
Because I took his picture.

1764
02:32:02,384 --> 02:32:05,945
He said, "If you take
my picture again...

1765
02:32:06,054 --> 02:32:08,579
I'm gonna kill you."

1766
02:32:08,690 --> 02:32:10,590
And he meant it.

1767
02:32:12,294 --> 02:32:14,990
See, just lay cool.
Lay cool.

1768
02:32:15,096 --> 02:32:17,064
Lay back. Dig it.

1769
02:32:17,165 --> 02:32:20,032
He gets friendly again.
He really does.

1770
02:32:20,135 --> 02:32:23,468
But you don't- you don't-
you don't judge the colonel.

1771
02:32:23,572 --> 02:32:26,234
You don't judge the colonel
like an ordinary man.

1772
02:32:33,048 --> 02:32:35,642
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans. Americans!

1773
02:32:35,750 --> 02:32:38,583
You can feel the vibe
of this place.

1774
02:32:38,687 --> 02:32:42,088
Let me take your picture. Hey,
could you hold- Hey, hello. Hello.

1775
02:32:42,190 --> 02:32:44,090
Could you hold up
a minute?

1776
02:33:06,147 --> 02:33:07,546
Colby.

1777
02:33:23,665 --> 02:33:25,394
The heads.

1778
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:27,695
You're looking at the heads.

1779
02:33:27,802 --> 02:33:30,999
I, uh- Sometimes
he goes too far.

1780
02:33:31,106 --> 02:33:33,802
He's the first one
to admit it.

1781
02:33:34,910 --> 02:33:37,811
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!

1782
02:33:39,147 --> 02:33:42,014
If you could have heard
the man just two days ago-

1783
02:33:42,117 --> 02:33:44,745
if you could have heard
him then, God-

1784
02:33:44,853 --> 02:33:48,118
- You were gonna call him crazy?
- Fuckin' A!

1785
02:33:50,225 --> 02:33:52,557
I just wanna talk to him.

1786
02:33:53,895 --> 02:33:57,194
Well, man, he's gone away.

1787
02:33:57,299 --> 02:34:00,029
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1788
02:34:00,135 --> 02:34:03,229
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.

1789
02:34:03,338 --> 02:34:06,239
He forgets himself
with his people.

1790
02:34:07,609 --> 02:34:10,373
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?

1791
02:34:10,478 --> 02:34:13,470
Maybe we should wait
back at the boat.

1792
02:34:13,581 --> 02:34:15,071
- I think you should-
- Okay, Chef.

1793
02:34:15,183 --> 02:34:17,413
We'll go back to the boat
for a while.

1794
02:34:17,519 --> 02:34:20,249
Yeah, stay with Lance.

1795
02:34:43,244 --> 02:34:46,008
This colonel guy,
he's wacko, man.

1796
02:34:46,114 --> 02:34:48,674
He's worse than crazy.
He's evil!

1797
02:34:48,783 --> 02:34:51,217
I mean, that's what the man's got
set up here, man!

1798
02:34:51,319 --> 02:34:53,787
It's fuckin' pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

1799
02:34:54,823 --> 02:34:58,020
- Shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?

1800
02:34:58,126 --> 02:35:01,220
Fuckin' A, I'll help you. I'll do
anything to get out of this joint.

1801
02:35:01,329 --> 02:35:04,526
- Good boy.
- We could blow all them assholes away.

1802
02:35:04,632 --> 02:35:08,466
They're so fuckin' spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1803
02:35:08,570 --> 02:35:13,200
I ain't afraid of all them
fuckin' skulls and altars and shit.

1804
02:35:14,843 --> 02:35:18,745
I used to think if I died
in an evil place...

1805
02:35:18,847 --> 02:35:22,044
then my soul wouldn't be able
to make it to Heaven.

1806
02:35:22,150 --> 02:35:25,381
But now, fuck-

1807
02:35:26,955 --> 02:35:29,924
I mean, I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1808
02:35:30,025 --> 02:35:33,825
So what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.

1809
02:35:33,928 --> 02:35:36,863
- Get out of here.
- I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1810
02:35:36,965 --> 02:35:41,299
I'll go up with Lance and
scrounge around, check the place out.

1811
02:35:41,403 --> 02:35:43,837
See if I can find
the colonel, okay?

1812
02:35:45,140 --> 02:35:48,166
Well, what do you
want me to do?

1813
02:35:48,276 --> 02:35:51,439
Here. You take the radio...

1814
02:35:51,546 --> 02:35:55,812
and if I don't get back
by 2200 hours...

1815
02:35:57,385 --> 02:35:59,979
you call in the air strike.

1816
02:36:01,356 --> 02:36:04,120
"Air strike?"

1817
02:36:04,225 --> 02:36:06,125
The code is "Almighty"...

1818
02:36:06,227 --> 02:36:09,628
coordinates zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

1819
02:36:09,731 --> 02:36:11,892
It's all in there.

1820
02:36:13,435 --> 02:36:17,462
Zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

1821
02:36:24,746 --> 02:36:28,682
<i>Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane.</i>

1822
02:36:32,353 --> 02:36:34,412
<i>The place was full of bodies-</i>

1823
02:36:34,522 --> 02:36:38,720
<i>North Vietnamese,
Vietcong, Cambodians.</i>

1824
02:36:45,733 --> 02:36:50,102
<i>If I was still alive,
it was because he wanted me that way.</i>

1825
02:37:23,304 --> 02:37:27,001
<i>It smelled like
slow death in there-</i>

1826
02:37:27,108 --> 02:37:29,440
<i>malaria...</i>

1827
02:37:29,544 --> 02:37:31,444
<i>and nightmares.</i>

1828
02:37:33,348 --> 02:37:36,249
<i>This was the end
of the river, all right.</i>

1829
02:37:49,697 --> 02:37:51,927
Where are you from, Willard?

1830
02:37:56,771 --> 02:37:59,239
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1831
02:38:04,212 --> 02:38:06,544
Were you born there?

1832
02:38:06,648 --> 02:38:08,843
Yes, sir.

1833
02:38:08,950 --> 02:38:11,145
Whereabouts?

1834
02:38:11,252 --> 02:38:13,152
Toledo, sir.

1835
02:38:19,160 --> 02:38:21,720
How far are you
from the river?

1836
02:38:27,869 --> 02:38:29,769
The Ohio River, sir?

1837
02:38:32,106 --> 02:38:34,006
About 200 miles.

1838
02:38:41,849 --> 02:38:45,080
I went down that river
once when I was a kid.

1839
02:38:49,591 --> 02:38:52,583
There's a place in the river-
I can't remember-

1840
02:38:52,694 --> 02:38:57,927
Must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1841
02:38:58,032 --> 02:39:02,196
It's all wild and overgrown now.
But for about-

1842
02:39:02,303 --> 02:39:04,794
for about five miles
you'd think that...

1843
02:39:04,906 --> 02:39:08,364
heaven just fell
on the earth...

1844
02:39:08,476 --> 02:39:10,876
in the form of gardenias.

1845
02:39:27,028 --> 02:39:28,928
Have you ever considered...

1846
02:39:30,732 --> 02:39:32,632
any real freedoms?

1847
02:39:37,772 --> 02:39:41,503
Freedoms from
the opinion of others?

1848
02:39:44,178 --> 02:39:47,477
Even the opinions
of yourself?

1849
02:40:02,497 --> 02:40:06,763
Did they say why, Willard?

1850
02:40:08,269 --> 02:40:13,070
Why they wanted
to terminate my command?

1851
02:40:28,523 --> 02:40:32,015
I was sent on
a classified mission, sir.

1852
02:40:34,962 --> 02:40:38,989
It's no longer
classified, is it?

1853
02:40:45,540 --> 02:40:47,770
What did they tell you?

1854
02:40:50,144 --> 02:40:52,544
They told me...

1855
02:40:52,647 --> 02:40:55,309
that you had gone...

1856
02:40:55,416 --> 02:40:57,316
totally insane...

1857
02:40:59,420 --> 02:41:03,447
and that your methods...

1858
02:41:03,558 --> 02:41:06,459
were unsound.

1859
02:41:09,831 --> 02:41:12,391
Are my methods unsound?

1860
02:41:17,805 --> 02:41:21,434
I don't see any method...

1861
02:41:22,944 --> 02:41:24,844
at all, sir.

1862
02:41:30,952 --> 02:41:33,546
I expected...

1863
02:41:33,654 --> 02:41:35,815
someone like you.

1864
02:41:37,925 --> 02:41:39,950
What did you expect?

1865
02:41:47,568 --> 02:41:49,468
Are you an assassin?

1866
02:41:54,208 --> 02:41:55,971
I'm a soldier.

1867
02:41:59,013 --> 02:42:00,913
You're neither.

1868
02:42:02,617 --> 02:42:05,814
You're an errand boy...

1869
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:08,582
sent by grocery clerks...

1870
02:42:11,993 --> 02:42:14,757
to collect the bill.

1871
02:42:57,738 --> 02:42:59,706
Why, huh?

1872
02:42:59,807 --> 02:43:03,868
Why would a nice guy
like you wanna kill a genius?

1873
02:43:10,518 --> 02:43:12,748
Feeling pretty good, huh?

1874
02:43:12,854 --> 02:43:14,253
Why?

1875
02:43:15,823 --> 02:43:17,882
Do you know-

1876
02:43:17,992 --> 02:43:20,654
Do you know that the man-

1877
02:43:23,598 --> 02:43:25,725
the man really likes you?

1878
02:43:28,936 --> 02:43:31,063
He likes you.
He really likes you.

1879
02:43:31,172 --> 02:43:36,075
But he's got something
in mind for you.

1880
02:43:36,177 --> 02:43:38,702
Aren't you curious about that?

1881
02:43:38,813 --> 02:43:43,773
I'm curious. I'm very curious.
Are you curious?

1882
02:43:46,621 --> 02:43:49,886
There's something
happening out here, man.

1883
02:43:53,628 --> 02:43:55,994
You know something, man.
I know something that you don't know.

1884
02:43:56,097 --> 02:43:58,964
That's right, Jack.

1885
02:43:59,066 --> 02:44:02,035
The man is clear
in his mind...

1886
02:44:02,136 --> 02:44:04,434
but his soul is mad.

1887
02:44:05,706 --> 02:44:08,197
Oh, yeah.

1888
02:44:08,309 --> 02:44:10,209
He's dying, I think.

1889
02:44:10,311 --> 02:44:13,371
He hates all this.
He hates it.

1890
02:44:13,481 --> 02:44:16,541
But the man's-

1891
02:44:20,555 --> 02:44:23,217
He reads poetry out loud,
all right?

1892
02:44:25,092 --> 02:44:26,923
And a voice-

1893
02:44:28,029 --> 02:44:29,587
a voice-

1894
02:44:32,099 --> 02:44:34,795
He likes you
'cause you're still alive.

1895
02:44:34,902 --> 02:44:39,930
He's got plans for you.
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.

1896
02:44:40,041 --> 02:44:43,977
You're gonna help him, man.
You're gonna help him.

1897
02:44:44,078 --> 02:44:46,808
I mean, what are they gonna say,
man, when he's gone, huh?

1898
02:44:46,914 --> 02:44:51,476
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1899
02:44:51,586 --> 02:44:55,317
What are they gonna say about him? What
are they gonna say? He was a kind man?

1900
02:44:55,423 --> 02:44:58,915
He was a wise man?
He had plans? He had wisdom?

1901
02:44:59,026 --> 02:45:00,926
Bullshit, man!

1902
02:45:01,028 --> 02:45:06,261
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1903
02:45:09,270 --> 02:45:11,431
You.

1904
02:45:15,610 --> 02:45:17,703
Almost eight hours.

1905
02:45:22,683 --> 02:45:25,311
I'm asleep.

1906
02:45:25,419 --> 02:45:28,946
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.

1907
02:45:40,501 --> 02:45:41,900
Fuck.

1908
02:45:45,473 --> 02:45:47,873
Has it been eight hours?

1909
02:45:50,311 --> 02:45:52,302
Hello. Almighty. Almighty.

1910
02:45:52,413 --> 02:45:57,248

"The War on the Horizon. The American
people may find it hard to believe...

1919
02:49:56,757 --> 02:49:59,487
that the US is winning
the war in Vietnam.

1920
02:49:59,593 --> 02:50:02,221
Nevertheless...

1921
02:50:02,329 --> 02:50:04,695
one of the most
exhaustive inquiries...

1922
02:50:04,798 --> 02:50:07,562
into the status
of the conflict yet compiled...

1923
02:50:07,668 --> 02:50:10,933
offers considerable evidence
that the weight of US power...

1924
02:50:11,038 --> 02:50:13,632
two-and-a-half years
after the big buildup began...

1925
02:50:13,741 --> 02:50:16,767
is beginning to
make itself felt.

1926
02:50:16,877 --> 02:50:20,574
White House officials maintain
the impact of that strength...

1927
02:50:22,149 --> 02:50:25,312
may bring the enemy
to the point where he could...

1928
02:50:25,419 --> 02:50:28,582
simply be unable

1929
02:50:30,524 --> 02:50:31,718

1930
02:50:33,661 --> 02:50:37,324
"Because Lyndon Johnson
fears that the US public...

is in no mood to accept
its optimistic conclusions...

1932
02:50:40,868 --> 02:50:43,803
he may never permit the report
to be released in full.

1933
02:50:43,904 --> 02:50:47,101
Even so, he is sufficiently
impressed with the findings...

1934
02:50:47,207 --> 02:50:50,574
and sufficiently anxious to
make their conclusions known...

1935
02:50:50,678 --> 02:50:53,647
to permit experts
who have been working on it...

1936

as wind in dry grass...

Do you know what
the man's saying? Do you?

1963
02:56:05,659 --> 02:56:09,322
This is dialectics.
It's very simple dialectics.

1964
02:56:09,429 --> 02:56:12,990
It's one through nine.
No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.

1965

You can't travel in space. You can't
go out into space, you know...

02:56:16,570 --> 02:56:18,595

with fractions.

1967
02:56:18,705 --> 02:56:21,196
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?

1968
02:56:21,308 --> 02:56:23,708
What are you gonna do when
you go from here to Venus?

1969
02:56:23,810 --> 02:56:25,209
That's dialectic physics, okay.

1970
02:56:25,312 --> 02:56:27,712
Dialectic logic is,
there's only love and hate.

1971
02:56:27,814 --> 02:56:29,782
You either love somebody
or you hate 'em.

1972
02:56:29,883 --> 02:56:30,747
Mutt!

1973
02:56:32,919 --> 02:56:35,752
You mutt.

1974
02:56:35,856 --> 02:56:38,586
This is the way
the fucking world is.

1975
02:56:38,692 --> 02:56:41,252
Look at this fucking shit
we're in, man!

1976
02:56:41,361 --> 02:56:43,295
Not with a bang.
A whimper.

1977
02:56:43,397 --> 02:56:46,889

1980

1982

<i>I was free.</i>

1983
02:57:31,078 --> 02:57:34,309
<i>But he knew
I wasn't going anywhere.</i>

1984
02:57:34,414 --> 02:57:38,009
<i>He knew more about what
I was going to do than I did.</i>

1985

<i>If the generals back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw...</i>

1986
02:57:49,363 --> 02:57:51,695

1987
02:57:53,266 --> 02:57:56,292

<i>And what would his people back home
want if they ever learned...</i>

1989
02:57:59,439 --> 02:58:01,999
<i>just how far from them
he'd really gone?</i>

1990
02:58:04,111 --> 02:58:06,079
<i>He broke from them...</i>

1991
02:58:06,179 --> 02:58:08,909
<i>and then he broke
from himself.</i>

1992
02:58:09,015 --> 02:58:12,382
<i>I'd never seen a man
so broken up and...</i>

1993
02:58:12,486 --> 02:58:14,386
<i>ripped apart.</i>

1994
02:58:14,488 --> 02:58:17,184
I've seen the horrors-

1995
02:58:17,290 --> 02:58:19,622
horrors that you've seen.

1996
02:58:21,161 --> 02:58:23,186
But you have no right
to call me a murderer.

1997
02:58:23,296 --> 02:58:26,390
You have a right to kill me.

1998
02:58:26,500 --> 02:58:29,401
You have a right
to do that.

1999
02:58:30,637 --> 02:58:33,231
But you have no right
to judge me.

2000
02:58:39,546 --> 02:58:41,844
It's impossible for words...

2001
02:58:43,550 --> 02:58:45,108
to describe...

2002
02:58:47,087 --> 02:58:50,386
what is necessary...

2003
02:58:52,426 --> 02:58:54,690
to those...

2004
02:58:54,795 --> 02:58:57,320
who do not know...

2005
02:58:57,431 --> 02:59:00,992
what horror means.

2006
02:59:02,836 --> 02:59:04,235
Horror.

2007
02:59:07,007 --> 02:59:09,908
Horror has a face.

2008
02:59:12,179 --> 02:59:15,512
And you must make
a friend of horror.

2009
02:59:15,615 --> 02:59:19,244
Horror and moral terror...

2010
02:59:19,352 --> 02:59:21,252
are your friends.

2011
02:59:21,354 --> 02:59:23,481
If they are not...

2012
02:59:23,590 --> 02:59:27,390
then they are enemies
to be feared.

2013
02:59:27,494 --> 02:59:29,860
They are truly enemies.

2014
02:59:34,568 --> 02:59:38,402
I remember when I was
with Special Forces.

2015
02:59:41,875 --> 02:59:45,868
Seems a thousand centuries ago.

2016
02:59:49,349 --> 02:59:52,079
We went into a camp
to inoculate...

2017
02:59:54,354 --> 02:59:55,912
some children.

2018
02:59:59,793 --> 03:00:02,523
We'd left the camp...

2019
03:00:02,629 --> 03:00:05,894
after we had inoculated
the children for polio.

2020
03:00:07,567 --> 03:00:10,263
And this old man came running
after us, and he was crying.

2021
03:00:10,370 --> 03:00:12,270
He couldn't say.

2022
03:00:14,708 --> 03:00:16,972
We went back there...

2023
03:00:17,077 --> 03:00:20,808
and they had come
and hacked off...

2024
03:00:20,914 --> 03:00:23,439
every inoculated arm.

2025
03:00:25,018 --> 03:00:27,384
There they were,
in a pile-

2026
03:00:27,487 --> 03:00:29,045
a pile of...

2027
03:00:30,690 --> 03:00:32,590
little arms.

2028
03:00:33,860 --> 03:00:36,852
And I remember...

2029
03:00:38,365 --> 03:00:41,425
I- I- I cried.

2030
03:00:41,535 --> 03:00:43,435
I wept like...

2031
03:00:45,038 --> 03:00:48,235
some grandmother.

2032
03:00:49,943 --> 03:00:54,744
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

2033
03:00:54,848 --> 03:00:57,976
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

2034
03:00:58,084 --> 03:01:00,814
I never want to forget.

2035
03:01:00,921 --> 03:01:03,685
And then I realized...

2036
03:01:04,791 --> 03:01:06,759
like I was shot-

2037
03:01:06,860 --> 03:01:10,125
like I was shot
with a diamond-

2038
03:01:10,230 --> 03:01:13,893
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

2039
03:01:15,435 --> 03:01:19,337
And I thought,
"My God, the genius of that.

2040
03:01:19,439 --> 03:01:21,839
The genius."

2041
03:01:21,942 --> 03:01:24,706
The will to do that.

2042
03:01:26,179 --> 03:01:30,946
Perfect, genuine, complete,
crystalline, pure.

2043
03:01:32,852 --> 03:01:34,752
And then I realized...

2044
03:01:34,854 --> 03:01:38,688
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

2045
03:01:38,792 --> 03:01:41,522
These were not monsters.
These were men-

2046
03:01:41,628 --> 03:01:44,119
trained cadres.

2047
03:01:44,230 --> 03:01:46,892
These men who fought
with their hearts...

2048
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:48,991
who have families,
who have children...

2049
03:01:49,102 --> 03:01:51,036
who are filled with love...

2050
03:01:51,137 --> 03:01:54,504
that they had the strength-

2051
03:01:54,608 --> 03:01:56,508
the strength...

2052
03:02:00,180 --> 03:02:02,080
to do that.

2053
03:02:02,182 --> 03:02:07,210
If I had ten divisions
of those men...

2054
03:02:07,320 --> 03:02:10,812
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

2055
03:02:12,459 --> 03:02:15,553
You have to have men...

2056
03:02:15,662 --> 03:02:17,562
who are moral...

2057
03:02:19,032 --> 03:02:21,364
and at the same time...

2058
03:02:21,468 --> 03:02:23,527
who are able to...

2059
03:02:24,638 --> 03:02:26,538
utilize their...

2060
03:02:28,842 --> 03:02:32,608
primordial instincts to kill...

2061
03:02:32,712 --> 03:02:35,681
without feeling,
without passion...

2062
03:02:36,916 --> 03:02:40,545
without judgment-
without judgment.

2063
03:02:44,924 --> 03:02:48,416
Because it's judgment
that defeats us.

2064
03:03:07,013 --> 03:03:10,244
I worry that my son...

2065
03:03:10,350 --> 03:03:14,252
might not understand
what I've tried to be.

2066
03:03:16,489 --> 03:03:21,620
And if I were
to be killed, Willard...

2067
03:03:22,862 --> 03:03:25,626
I would want someone
to go to my home...

2068
03:03:25,732 --> 03:03:29,065
and tell my son everything.

2069
03:03:31,504 --> 03:03:35,998
Everything I did.
Everything you saw.

2070
03:03:36,109 --> 03:03:40,136
Because there's nothing
that I detest more than...

2071
03:03:40,246 --> 03:03:42,578
<i>the stench of lies.</i>

2072
03:03:44,718 --> 03:03:47,949
<i>And if you understand me,
Willard, you-</i>

2073
03:03:49,823 --> 03:03:52,951
<i>you will do this for me.</i>

2074
03:04:58,424 --> 03:05:02,224
<i>PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty. Over.</i>

2075
03:05:02,328 --> 03:05:06,196
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over.</i>

2076
03:05:07,567 --> 03:05:12,266
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty
standing by. How do you copy?</i>

2077
03:05:16,976 --> 03:05:20,434
<i>They were gonna make me
a major for this...</i>

2078
03:05:20,547 --> 03:05:23,539
<i>and I wasn't even in
their fuckin' army anymore.</i>

2079
03:05:25,785 --> 03:05:29,243
<i>Everybody wanted me to do it.</i>

2080
03:05:29,355 --> 03:05:32,290
<i>Him most of all.</i>

2081
03:05:32,392 --> 03:05:34,826
<i>I felt like he was up there...</i>

2082
03:05:34,928 --> 03:05:38,056
<i>waiting for me
to take the pain away.</i>

2083
03:05:40,133 --> 03:05:42,761
<i>He just wanted to go out
like a soldier...</i>

2084
03:05:42,869 --> 03:05:45,565
<i>standing up.</i>

2085
03:05:45,672 --> 03:05:49,699
<i>Not like some poor,
wasted, rag-assed renegade.</i>

2086
03:05:53,046 --> 03:05:56,140
<i>Even the jungle wanted him dead.</i>

2087
03:05:56,249 --> 03:05:59,514
<i>And that's who he really
took his orders from anyway.</i>

2088
03:06:39,325 --> 03:06:43,227
<i>Come on, baby
take a chance with us</i>

2089
03:06:48,001 --> 03:06:52,165
<i>Come on, baby
take a chance with us</i>

2090
03:06:56,542 --> 03:06:59,636
<i>Come on, baby
take a chance with us</i>

2091
03:06:59,746 --> 03:07:04,979
<i>And meet me at the back
of the blue bus tonight</i>

2092
03:07:05,084 --> 03:07:07,575
<i>Blue bus tonight</i>

2093
03:07:07,687 --> 03:07:10,747
<i>Blue bus tonight
Blue</i>

2094
03:07:10,857 --> 03:07:14,258
<i>Come on, yeah</i>

2095
03:07:16,462 --> 03:07:19,192
We train young men
to drop fire on people...

2096
03:07:19,299 --> 03:07:22,735
but their commanders...

2097
03:07:22,835 --> 03:07:26,396
won't allow them
to write "fuck"...

2098
03:07:26,506 --> 03:07:29,532
on their airplanes because...

2099
03:07:29,642 --> 03:07:31,542
it's obscene.

2100
03:08:54,327 --> 03:08:56,227
The horror.

2101
03:08:59,932 --> 03:09:01,263
The horror.

2102
03:14:23,956 --> 03:14:25,981
<i>Calling PBR Street Gang.</i>

2103
03:14:26,959 --> 03:14:30,395
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Do you read me? Over.</i>

2104
03:14:31,831 --> 03:14:34,527
<i>PBR Street Gang?</i>

2105
03:14:34,633 --> 03:14:36,760
<i>PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty-</i>

2106
03:15:14,573 --> 03:15:16,131
<i>The horror.</i>

2107
03:15:20,079 --> 03:15:21,637
<i>The horror.</i>
