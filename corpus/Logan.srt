1
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:59,783
<i>We get the wheels,
we get</i> la feria,

2
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,811
<i>we keep moving on.
No messing around.</i>

3
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,040
<i>You mess those wheels up
this time, Chong,</i>

4
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,074
<i>I'm gonna have your ass.</i>

5
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,149
<i>Move!</i>

6
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:08,017
<i>- Right there, homes.
- There's nobody, homes.</i>

7
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:09,296
<i>Where's your party, boy?</i>

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,780
<i>Turn down the radio.</i>

9
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:12,347
You inviting the cops, too,
or what?

10
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:13,487
I want <i>El cromo.</i>

11
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:16,578
Gonna get some green

12
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,161
for this shit
right here, homes.

13
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,831
Fuck.

14
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:25,169
Hey.

15
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:41,443
Uh, guys?

16
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,107
Those are chrome-plated lugs.
You're gonna strip them.

17
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,393
Look at this guy, eh?

18
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,111
The plating flakes off.

19
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:49,356
Yeah?

20
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,327
This is a lease.
No one's gonna pay to ride...

21
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,501
Shit.

22
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,126
Come on, man.

23
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,180
Uh, guys, guys.

24
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:18,517
What the fuck?

25
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:21,233
Guys, seriously,
you don't wanna do this.

26
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,234
Take him out.

27
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,072
Fuck him up!

28
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,577
No! Not the car!

29
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,709
Get that <i>puto!</i>

30
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,086
Fuck him up, man!

31
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,550
Fuck him up!

32
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:58,432
Get him!

33
00:02:58,596 --> 00:02:59,886
Hit that fool!

34
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,024
Motherfucker!

35
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:37,637
Shit.

36
00:03:58,573 --> 00:03:59,873
Fuck.

37
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,285
<i>Everyone's asleep, Burt.</i>

38
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:54,207
<i>Sleepwalking.
Between the ice caps,</i>

39
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,665
<i>the pornographers,
poisoned water, mutants...</i>

40
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,295
<i>it's all connected.</i>

41
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,803
<i>Hey, Clyde. It's 2029.</i>

42
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:03,512
<i>Why are we still
talking about mutants?</i>

43
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,059
Hey, it's me. I'm in the car.

44
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:08,555
Yeah, it was a good trip.

45
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,229
Killed it up and down
the fence.

46
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,896
USA! USA! USA!

47
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:20,655
USA! USA! USA! USA!

48
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,272
Wolverine.

49
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,227
I knew it was you.

50
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,729
Oh, fuck.
Please!

51
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,573
I'm in trouble!

52
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,936
You're the only one
that could help!

53
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,702
Get the fuck away from me!

54
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:08,945
Please!

55
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,211
Logan!

56
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:17,461
Who was that?

57
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,463
I don't know, some crazy lady.
Don't worry.

58
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:25,571
As I live and breathe,
the Wolverine.

59
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,867
And he's a junkie now.

60
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,492
Who the fuck are you?

61
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,155
You know, you got some
buckshot in your door.

62
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,038
I heard you was in Phoenix.

63
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:38,042
But then, last night,
some friends of mine

64
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,286
in Texas HP called...

65
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,710
and told me they found

66
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,005
three dead cholos
in a pullout on 54.

67
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,298
Not unusual, I know.

68
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,967
Except one was missing a hand,
another one a leg.

69
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,564
So they was thinking...

70
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,732
it was either an escaped
tiger or Freddy Krueger.

71
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:57,308
But neither one of them
can drive...

72
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,478
one being fictional,
the other one extinct.

73
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,818
And since the wheel lugs
they found

74
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,820
belonged to
a '24 Chrysler...

75
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,990
and, well...

76
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,568
this is a '24 Chrysler.

77
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,494
She found you yet?

78
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,831
Gabriela?

79
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,084
See...

80
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,749
I'm not looking for you,
Wolvie.

81
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,338
Well, not really.
I'm looking for someone

82
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,761
who's looking for you.

83
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,760
She took something of mine
when I wasn't looking.

84
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,756
Something for which
I am responsible.

85
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,524
Mexican lady.

86
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,386
Has her sights
on you now.

87
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,231
Doesn't ring any bells?

88
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:42,477
I don't know any Gabriela,

89
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:43,935
so get the fuck
out of my car.

90
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:45,744
Oh.

91
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:47,817
You know...

92
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,779
I know
what you're hiding, <i>amigo.</i>

93
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,035
The old cue ball
south of the border.

94
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:55,945
What do you want?

95
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,710
A little co-operation.

96
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,634
I'm a fan, by the way.

97
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,350
Fuck, fuck!

98
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,814
No, Mr. Esperanza, no.

99
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,983
I know I said June,
but I need the boat now.

100
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,649
Why would that mean
the price go up?

101
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,897
Listen to me.

102
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,910
I know you wanted 70...

103
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:32,382
Okay, what if I could
put together

104
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,406
$45,000 cash right now?

105
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,155
Hello? Hello?

106
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,447
Shit.

107
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:41,915
Hey, Sam.

108
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,083
Morning.

109
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,393
"I know that virtue
to be in you, Brutus.

110
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:38,063
"As well as I do know
your outward favor.

111
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,522
"Well, honor is the subject
of my story."

112
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,143
He's having a bad day.

113
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,690
They're all bad days.

114
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,689
He needed these
six hours ago.

115
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,742
This is not enough,
you know.

116
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,200
Won't see us
through the week.

117
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,533
I'm working on it.

118
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:58,867
Your turn.

119
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,157
I've had a rough night.

120
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:03,867
Poor you.

121
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,339
In other news,
he told me last night

122
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:11,671
he's communicating
with someone.

123
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,759
He's not talking
to anybody.

124
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,224
Don't be so sure.

125
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,394
He's got all these details.

126
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:20,103
I thought that tank was
supposed to act as a barrier.

127
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,434
It's got them cracks in it.

128
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,769
Just please stop.

129
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:24,444
Bottom left.

130
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,528
You're not listening.

131
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,953
He's been asking questions
again about why we're here.

132
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,783
I think he's trying to
read my mind.

133
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,238
That's what
these are for.

134
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,446
<i>Eating his curds and whey</i>

135
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:46,291
<i>Then came a big spider
Which sat down beside her</i>

136
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:47,617
<i>And frightened Miss Muffet...</i>

137
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:03,268
Friends, I have
good news for you today!

138
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,812
It's not about what you do.

139
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,975
It's not about your deeds.

140
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,561
You can't
live up to God's rules.

141
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:12,729
He knows that you can't.
It's okay, we're imperfect.

142
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,492
Make way, sir.

143
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,823
I said make way!

144
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,119
The new Quesalupa
from Taco Bell!

145
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,624
Get it with chicken!
Get it with steak!

146
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,827
And with the cheese baked
right in the shell...

147
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,787
it's the next big thing!

148
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,958
Go now while supplies last.

149
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,841
Who are you?

150
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,588
You know who I am.

151
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,086
You're the man
who puts me to sleep.

152
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,469
We both could use
some sleep.

153
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,005
No! No!

154
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,643
What are you doing to me?

155
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,726
Charles.

156
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,187
Come on, now.

157
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:36,358
How long have I been here?

158
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,091
What are these?

159
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,566
You remember
what they are.

160
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,510
The shots
mellow the seizures.

161
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,262
The pills
keep them from happening.

162
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,429
How about you blow on them
to make them safe?

163
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,718
Fuck off, Logan.

164
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,391
So you remember
who I am now.

165
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,899
I always know who you are.

166
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,562
It's just sometimes
I don't recognize you.

167
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:17,902
Take the pills.

168
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,449
You leave me alone
with that fucking albino.

169
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,117
He doesn't listen to me.

170
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,409
I know a damn speciation
when I see one.

171
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,580
A what?

172
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,788
Speciation.
New mutant, a young one.

173
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,771
There are forces
trying to kill them.

174
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,625
Forces?
They want help.

175
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,297
Forces, forces.

176
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,796
It's too bad you're not
in that business anymore.

177
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:47,599
They don't want me,
they want you.

178
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:53,136
Oh, yes, that's how
fucking stupid they are.

179
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:57,151
They're waiting for you
at the Statue of Liberty.

180
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,574
The Statue of Liberty
was a long time ago,

181
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,990
Charles, a long time.

182
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:04,149
There are no new mutants.
Understand?

183
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,491
Hasn't been a new one born
in 25 years. Not anywhere.

184
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,118
You always thought...

185
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,947
we were part of God's plan.

186
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,833
But maybe...

187
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,498
Maybe we were God's mistake.

188
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:33,099
What a disappointment
you are.

189
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,146
When I found you...

190
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:41,153
you were pursuing a career
as a cage fighter.

191
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,525
A warm capper to a life
as an assassin.

192
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,945
Hooked on barbiturates.

193
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,374
You were an animal.

194
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,039
But we took you in.

195
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,833
I gave you a family.

196
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,290
And they're gone now.

197
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,384
Logan.

198
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:00,877
Logan...

199
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:04,547
What did you do?

200
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,224
What did you do?

201
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,465
Answer me!
Why are we here?

202
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:12,388
No one should live
like this.

203
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,966
Drugged in a fucking tank!

204
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,231
It's for your own good.

205
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,391
No, it's not!

206
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,070
You're waiting for me
to die.

207
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,673
I don't wanna fight...

208
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,495
but there's things
we need to discuss.

209
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:09,919
What things?

210
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,967
Well, would it be
considered nagging...

211
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,758
if I was to repeat
my previous observation...

212
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,520
that the dose is too low
to suppress the seizures?

213
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,268
It's what the guy gave me.

214
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,687
Wasn't in a position
to make demands.

215
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,266
I almost died this morning.

216
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,002
That seizure was...
It was barely a minute.

217
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,171
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I couldn't breathe.

218
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,525
You're less affected.

219
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,526
You know
he needs a higher dose.

220
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:37,488
And I know you got more
money squirreled away.

221
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,928
That money's
to get us out of here.

222
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,702
No, not us.
You and him.

223
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,501
You're saving
to buy a Sunseeker.

224
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,004
"Sun" is the keyword.

225
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,376
I hardly see myself cowering
below decks like Nosferatu.

226
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,554
Do you?

227
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:52,472
Folding your underpants,
and making him spotted dick.

228
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:57,844
Found this in your pocket.

229
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,888
Adamantium.

230
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,329
If you are planning
to blow your brains out...

231
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,164
could you wait till you're
out on the high seas?

232
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,438
I just mopped
these floors.

233
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,904
I don't need this shit.

234
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,996
A year ago, you asked
me to help you.

235
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,915
And God knows
I've tried.

236
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,713
But I can't help you,
Logan, not really...

237
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,380
if you're not
going to talk to me.

238
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,051
I hear you at night.
You're not sleeping.

239
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,887
You don't wanna
talk about that.

240
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,757
Or the booze
you're drinking.

241
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,851
Or the pus you're wiping
away from your knuckles.

242
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,940
Or the blood
I wash from your clothes.

243
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,441
Or the fresh wounds
in your chest.

244
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,938
The ones
that aren't healing.

245
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,532
And I'm pretty sure...

246
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,712
you don't wanna talk
about the fact

247
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,606
that you can't read
the label on that bottle.

248
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,532
It says, "Ibuprofen."

249
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,788
That was my favorite mug.

250
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,117
Stay out of my shit.

251
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,751
Something's happening
to you, Logan.

252
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,497
On the inside you're sick.
I can smell it.

253
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,545
<i>Best night ever!</i>

254
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:22,973
Hey, driver.

255
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,580
I love you.
I love you.

256
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,414
You're such a doll.

257
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,721
Mr. Logan.

258
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:44,927
Oh, Jesus.

259
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,683
Please. We need a ride.

260
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,728
Not available.
Call a cab.

261
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:49,892
My name
is Gabriela Lopez.

262
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,162
I don't wanna
know your name, lady.

263
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,646
There are men after us.

264
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,290
We need to get out of here.

265
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,024
Go north,
cross to Canada.

266
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,731
Anyone can do that job.

267
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:58,901
I'll give you $50,000.

268
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,153
How did you find me, huh?

269
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,858
'Cause you are fucking up
my life, lady!

270
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,241
The people after you,
they're on my ass now!

271
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,539
Sightings were posted.

272
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:08,753
Laura, go inside.

273
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,080
What sightings?

274
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,975
People said someone who
looked like the Wolverine

275
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,999
was in El Paso, driving.

276
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,747
Said he looked old.

277
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:19,972
Hey!

278
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,093
I told you
to stop it with that ball!

279
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,389
Bad girl!
No, please.

280
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,102
I told you, bad girl!
No, please.

281
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,364
<i>Mamacita's</i> gonna
have to pay for that.

282
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,388
Stop, please. No.

283
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:30,771
Shit!

284
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,583
They're gonna
have to pay for damages.

285
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,399
And she has cash.

286
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:38,566
I've seen it.

287
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,420
You should get your fat ass
back in your office.

288
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:41,454
You'll get your money.

289
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,374
Don't let her call anyone,
please.

290
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,583
They will find us.
They will kill us.

291
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,130
I am a nurse.

292
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,801
Was. In Mexico City.

293
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,430
When did that happen?

294
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,974
This morning.
Near the border.

295
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,981
I got away
from them, but...

296
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:16,312
...now they know my car.

297
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,403
Look, I gotta go.

298
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,779
No, wait. Please. Here.

299
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,323
Please, wait! Look.

300
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,240
Look. Here, take this.
It's $20,000.

301
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,583
Here. Take us
to this address.

302
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,174
You can have $30,000 more
when we get there.

303
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,630
My friends there
will give it to you.

304
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,587
They will be waiting.

305
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,011
They will give you anything.

306
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,302
Where did you get this?

307
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,797
My boyfriend.

308
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,311
He wants to kill me
and take her.

309
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,015
And that's your daughter?

310
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Yes.

311
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,151
I know
you're still good inside.

312
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,399
I know you want to help us.

313
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,506
You don't know
anything about me.

314
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,530
Please!

315
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,874
I promise, there will be
no problems if we leave now.

316
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:12,954
I can't just leave
to North Dakota!

317
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,620
We have to be there Friday.
Or what?

318
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,368
Or we miss our chance
to cross.

319
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:18,998
Please.

320
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,213
You have to. Please.

321
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:25,804
Please.

322
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,058
I like those.
Huh?

323
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,935
They make you look younger.

324
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,728
Charles, listen.

325
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,398
I gotta go away
for a few days, okay?

326
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,408
I got a long ride
for some good money...

327
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,452
but when I get back,
we're gonna get outta here.

328
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,534
We're gonna
drive down to Yelapa.

329
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:53,897
We're gonna
get ourselves a boat.

330
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,911
And we're gonna
go live on the ocean.

331
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,079
Will you be safe there?

332
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,538
Yeah. We'll be safe.

333
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,301
Look what Logan got us,
Charles.

334
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,929
Be back
in a few days.

335
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,258
Shit.

336
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,009
Logan.
Yeah?

337
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:30,342
What happened?

338
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,877
Did something go wrong?

339
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,510
The job was wrong
to begin with.

340
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,030
Logan!

341
00:26:58,368 --> 00:26:59,488
Logan!

342
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:00,701
What?

343
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,871
Who does this belong to?

344
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,550
Who's that?

345
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,052
Thought you were supposed to
see shit coming.

346
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:19,391
I can track mutants.

347
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,556
I'm a glorified truffle pig,
not a clairvoyant.

348
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,385
Go inside
and keep Charles quiet.

349
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:24,848
Go inside now!

350
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,992
You need to turn around,
asshole.

351
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,072
This is private property.

352
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,450
Yes, it is.

353
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,909
In fact,
I believe it belongs

354
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,576
to a multinational
smelting company...

355
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,116
based in Shanghai.

356
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,959
Where are you keeping
the old man? Hmm?

357
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,586
Is he over there?

358
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:53,415
Or is he there?

359
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:55,591
That'd be smart.

360
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,393
I'd like to meet him.

361
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:02,184
I'm told the HSA
classifies his brain

362
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,305
as a weapon
of mass destruction now.

363
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,269
Damn shame,
what happened back east.

364
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,769
He's been dead for a year.

365
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,070
I need the girl.

366
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,284
What girl?

367
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,564
The one that goes along with
that ball you're holding.

368
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,622
There's no girl here.

369
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:20,452
I know you went
to the motel.

370
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:21,827
Yeah, I was called there.

371
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,913
There was no girl.
It was just the woman.

372
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,579
Just the woman.
Such as she was.

373
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,919
So, you saw Gabriela.

374
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:35,513
But you didn't call me.
That hurts.

375
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,733
You didn't shoot
the poor thing, did you?

376
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:39,932
No, did you?

377
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,143
I asked you first.

378
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,394
I don't like guns.

379
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:43,644
Of course.

380
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:47,192
I wish
you'd called me, Logan.

381
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:48,522
Like I asked.

382
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:52,818
See?

383
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,032
You're not the only one
that's been enhanced.

384
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,954
Logan. Logan!

385
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
This is Laura.

386
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:08,831
Caliban, come!

387
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,792
This is who
I've been telling you about.

388
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,670
This is Laura.

389
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,212
We've been waiting for you.

390
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,302
Come, come here.

391
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:24,853
It's okay.

392
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,348
Come.

393
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,061
Laura.

394
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,690
It's okay. It's okay.

395
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,817
Come.

396
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,068
Come.

397
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:43,316
Come. It's okay.
You can stay here, Laura.

398
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:44,825
It's safe.

399
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,576
We can look after you here.

400
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,203
Come on.

401
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,248
Looks like ex-military.
Bounty hunter, maybe?

402
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,417
Worse.

403
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:55,881
Is he by himself?

404
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,085
Yeah, not for long.

405
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,336
You get him back
in his ride,

406
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,054
take him out to the wash
and dump him.

407
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,887
What if he wakes up
before I get there?

408
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:10,187
Text me where you are.
We'll pick you up.

409
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:24,907
Yes.

410
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,078
Logan.

411
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,424
Logan.
Hey. Hey!

412
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,036
You'll get it back
after I figure out

413
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:36,766
what you and your mother
have got us into.

414
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,130
No, Logan.
What?

415
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:39,296
I think the...

416
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,350
Logan, the woman that you met,
that's not her mother.

417
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,648
So she talks?
We're communicating.

418
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,062
Communicating.

419
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:58,899
Take these now.

420
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,488
We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.

421
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,814
And you can't have an attack
out there, you understand?

422
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:09,115
Yes, but this is the mutant
that I told you about.

423
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,035
She needs our help.
She's not a mutant.

424
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,294
Yes, she is!

425
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:13,535
What's her gift, Charles?

426
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,166
Eating? Pipe throwing?

427
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,301
It's okay.

428
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:40,822
Oh, yeah.

429
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:42,904
Take the gun.
Dump the body.

430
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,149
Text me when you're
on the way back.

431
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,561
You have anything else
you need?

432
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,316
Food for the kid?

433
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,211
You're fucked now, mutie.

434
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,719
It's okay.

435
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,682
- Choo-choo.
- It's not a choo-choo.

436
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,345
It's okay. Sit down.

437
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,860
We gotta go.
What?

438
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,572
What's going on? Where?
Stay here.

439
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,192
Don't move.
Where are we going?

440
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,739
Hey, don't worry.
He will be back for you.

441
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,616
Logan, the girl. You've got
to go back for the girl.

442
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:40,037
Logan, what about the girl?

443
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:42,881
Logan.

444
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,602
Logan, we mustn't forget
about Laura.

445
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,103
She's not our problem.

446
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:02,694
Shit!

447
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,157
Ah, shit!

448
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:41,975
Logan.

449
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,266
Yeah, I'm thinking.

450
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,479
The child.

451
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:46,944
Logan,
we mustn't forget Laura.

452
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,280
Please be quiet.
Logan.

453
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,530
Huh.

454
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,446
Charles Xavier.
Where's Caliban?

455
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,953
America's most wanted
octogenarian.

456
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,621
I'm a nonagenarian,
actually.

457
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,628
Ah.

458
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:09,548
Where's Caliban?

459
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:13,195
Why don't you tell me
where the girl is first?

460
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,139
Or I could ask Cue Ball.
He seems quite friendly.

461
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,814
I told you,
she's not here.

462
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,233
Where's Caliban,
motherfucker?

463
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:21,662
Well, I left him
in the same ditch

464
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:22,806
he was gonna leave me in.

465
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,373
Jesus, Wolverine,

466
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,496
seeing you like this
just breaks my damn heart.

467
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,625
As soon as I rip it out
of your chest, fuck-stick.

468
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:53,837
Go get her.

469
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:08,078
Laura.

470
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:13,973
That a girl!

471
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,434
Hey, baby.

472
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,018
Laura...

473
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:31,021
Laura!

474
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,190
Honey, you wanna stay
where you are.

475
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,279
You wanna see
your friends, right?

476
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:39,162
Command, stop.

477
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,662
You said alive or dead.

478
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:43,952
Laura!

479
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:46,621
Laura.

480
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:49,379
Laura.

481
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,292
No. No.

482
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,552
Move! Go!

483
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,503
Move! Go!

484
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:07,483
Stop shooting!

485
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,733
She heals! Move! Go!

486
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,861
Holy shit!

487
00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,532
Gotcha!

488
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,250
Ah!

489
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:11,963
Come on, hold her down.

490
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:06,643
As I told you, Logan,
she's a mutant like you.

491
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:08,136
Hold on!

492
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:12,517
Very much like you.

493
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:35,833
Laura, are you all right?

494
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,643
Ahh!

495
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,810
Move!

496
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:05,737
Hold on!

497
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,367
Fuck! Come on!

498
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:15,997
Come on!

499
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,167
Shit.

500
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:18,482
Fall in! Let's go!

501
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,607
Oh, watch out!

502
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:27,954
Ah!

503
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:11,776
Sit back.

504
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,540
Bring me the tracker.

505
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:31,047
You.

506
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,295
Who the hell are you?

507
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,641
Hey! I asked you a question.
Who are you?

508
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,478
You know
who she is, Logan.

509
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:43,351
No, I don't.

510
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,730
Does she remind you
of anybody?

511
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:19,556
I read about you
when I was a kid.

512
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,100
I believe you're thinking
of someone else.

513
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:24,185
Hmm.

514
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:35,703
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
you used to work for my team.

515
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:38,908
You were helping round up
all those old mutes.

516
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,118
What changed?

517
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,544
You got religion?

518
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,253
I'm gonna need you to do

519
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:51,088
one more thing
for the good guys...

520
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:56,393
and track one more
special mute for me.

521
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:01,766
I'm not helping you.

522
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:03,933
Of course, you'd say that.

523
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:07,481
But I got a theory that
people don't really change.

524
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:12,396
Beware of the light.

525
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,199
Caliban, I bet that's what
your mama told you

526
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,910
every day when you was a kid.

527
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:25,463
Beware of the light.

528
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:34,087
Now, let's not bring out
the worst in each other.

529
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:35,763
The girl is not worth it,
trust me.

530
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:38,258
She's not a natural fuck-up
like you.

531
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:41,097
She's a business mistake,
a R&D gone bad.

532
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:42,433
There's liability.

533
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:44,215
They can't have things
with patents

534
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:46,098
running around,
hurting people, can they?

535
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:49,019
We need to get her off the board

536
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,774
before she hurts anybody else.

537
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:53,529
Someone you care about, maybe.

538
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,446
So, get to sniffin'.

539
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,955
<i>My name is Gabriela Lopez.</i>

540
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:10,631
<i>I am a nurse.</i>

541
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,423
<i>And for 10 years, I worked for</i>

542
00:45:12,503 --> 00:45:14,963
<i>Transigen Research
in Mexico City.</i>

543
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:18,843
<i>Transigen is owned
by an American company.</i>

544
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:24,681
<i>What I am about to show you
is illegal...</i>

545
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:27,305
<i>in the U.S. and Canada.</i>

546
00:45:34,817 --> 00:45:37,067
<i>They told us we were part
of a pharmaceutical study.</i>

547
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,238
<i>But, of course, that was a lie.</i>

548
00:45:39,405 --> 00:45:42,655
<i>These children
were born in Transigen.</i>

549
00:45:43,826 --> 00:45:45,196
<i>They were born here...</i>

550
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:47,749
<i>and have never left.</i>

551
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:50,503
<i>They have never seen
the sun or the ocean...</i>

552
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:52,843
<i>rain or snow...</i>

553
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:55,879
<i>or any of God's creatures.</i>

554
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:58,719
<i>They have no
birth certificates...</i>

555
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:00,676
<i>no names...</i>

556
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,180
<i>besides the ones
we have given them.</i>

557
00:46:06,223 --> 00:46:10,193
<i>They were raised in the
bellies of Mexican girls.</i>

558
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:12,232
<i>Girls no one
can find anymore.</i>

559
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:16,188
<i>Their fathers are</i>
semillas geneticas...

560
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:17,858
<i>special seeds in bottles.</i>

561
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:33,924
<i>- Birthday? No birth.
- Maria.</i>

562
00:46:34,877 --> 00:46:36,627
<i>We do not dress them up
for Halloween.</i>

563
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:39,919
<i>We do not call them "baby"
or kiss boo-boos.</i>

564
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:41,901
<i>Don't think of them
as children.</i>

565
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,005
<i>Think of them as things...</i>

566
00:46:43,093 --> 00:46:44,603
<i>with patents
and copyrights.</i>

567
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,720
<i>Comprende?</i>

568
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:46,814
<i>Si, senor.</i>

569
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:49,176
<i>They thought
we were too poor</i>

570
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:50,476
<i>and stupid to understand.</i>

571
00:46:51,143 --> 00:46:53,063
<i>We're poor, yes...</i>

572
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:54,268
<i>but we are not stupid.</i>

573
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:55,556
<i>Use your powers.</i>

574
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:04,161
<i>This is business.</i>

575
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:06,783
<i>They are making soldiers.</i>

576
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:08,409
<i>Killers.</i>

577
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,463
<i>These are babies
of</i> mutantes...

578
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:25,259
North Dakota.

579
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:26,427
Mmm.

580
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:28,763
You took that woman's money.

581
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:31,311
You said you would take
the child there.

582
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:38,232
What is she?

583
00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:41,278
She's your daughter, Logan.

584
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:45,155
Alkali has your genetic code.

585
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:46,492
Not just mine.

586
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:47,615
Logan...

587
00:47:47,658 --> 00:47:48,760
I don't want to talk
about it.

588
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:49,969
I don't wanna hear
about it anymore.

589
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,413
Logan...
Just stop.

590
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:53,254
I have to pee.

591
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:07,468
Last ride.

592
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:13,022
You're welcome.

593
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:20,886
Stop it.
For God's sake,

594
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:22,281
I can do this myself!

595
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,586
Yeah, well,
you're not doing it.

596
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,740
Just get on with it.

597
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,360
Not with you
standing there.

598
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,120
Trust me,
I'm not lookin'.

599
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:03,065
Hello.

600
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:04,822
Hi, there!

601
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:06,839
You know you gotta pay
for that, right?

602
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:11,414
Hey! Where's your
mommy and daddy, huh?

603
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:15,828
Come on.

604
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:17,076
That's enough. These, too.

605
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:20,424
Shit!

606
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:21,706
Not okay!

607
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,050
Sorry.

608
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:28,802
Um, do you sell
phone chargers?

609
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:30,514
Uh...

610
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,226
Come on. Get in the car.

611
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:05,714
<i>As the children
became older...</i>

612
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:07,919
<i>Laura. Laura.</i>

613
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,263
<i>...they became
more difficult.</i>

614
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:14,394
<i>They could not
be controlled.</i>

615
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:20,097
<i>The company made their bodies
into weapons.</i>

616
00:50:20,936 --> 00:50:22,936
<i>Tried to teach them to kill.</i>

617
00:50:23,105 --> 00:50:25,315
<i>But they did not
want to fight.</i>

618
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:30,900
<i>A soldier who will not fight
is useless.</i>

619
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,949
<i>Inside this building...</i>

620
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:36,437
<i>they are working on
something new.</i>

621
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,119
<i>Something they think
is better than the children.</i>

622
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:43,126
<i>Something they say
is without a soul.</i>

623
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:44,811
<i>Would you like to hear
my full lab report, Dr. Rice?</i>

624
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:46,495
<i>You can't get
good sushi here.</i>

625
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,803
<i>It's the Mexican equivalent
of Denver, Colorado.</i>

626
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:52,733
<i>They must have
been successful.</i>

627
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,970
<i>About a week ago, they told
us to shut our program down.</i>

628
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:01,309
<i>They started putting
the children to sleep.</i>

629
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:07,648
<i>We are going to save
as many children as we can.</i>

630
00:51:07,983 --> 00:51:10,073
<i>I read about a place,
up north.</i>

631
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:12,275
<i>A place for mutants.</i>

632
00:51:12,446 --> 00:51:13,656
<i>They call it Eden.</i>

633
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,300
<i>If you are watching this...</i>

634
00:51:30,464 --> 00:51:32,304
<i>it means that I am dead.</i>

635
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:36,643
<i>I am not sure if
any other children survived.</i>

636
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:39,143
<i>We were separated.</i>

637
00:51:39,306 --> 00:51:41,346
<i>There is no more money.</i>

638
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,186
<i>That was a lie.</i>

639
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,234
<i>She's not my child.</i>

640
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:49,151
<i>But I love her.</i>

641
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,688
<i>You may not love her.</i>

642
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,701
<i>But she is your child.</i>

643
00:51:57,866 --> 00:52:00,406
<i>Please. I beg you...</i>

644
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,870
<i>take her to safety.</i>

645
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:52,128
Is this where
we're hiding out?

646
00:52:52,796 --> 00:52:53,916
We're not hiding out.

647
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:56,087
We're gonna get
a couple of hours' sleep...

648
00:52:56,258 --> 00:52:57,838
clean up,
get some new clothes,

649
00:52:57,926 --> 00:53:00,096
get a new ride
and get outta here.

650
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,119
<i>Harrah's Hotel and Casino</i>

651
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:08,443
<i>welcomes you
to Oklahoma City.</i>

652
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:12,015
<i>Please keep right
for valet parking.</i>

653
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:13,147
Hey.

654
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:14,919
<i>The fun never stops at
Harrah's Hotel and Casino.</i>

655
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:17,453
Hey, keep it out front,
all right?

656
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:25,245
Come on, let's go.

657
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:53,358
Hey, Laura.

658
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:54,573
Let's go.

659
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:55,779
We need clothes.

660
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:09,706
<i>Going up.</i>

661
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,843
No, no, stop. Not a toy.

662
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:16,126
Uh, no, no, sorry, chair.

663
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:17,514
What? Okay.

664
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:19,166
Push up again.
Thank you.

665
00:54:19,341 --> 00:54:20,381
<i>Going up.</i>

666
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,680
Come here. Stand there.
Just stand there.

667
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,760
Logan, it's yours.

668
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:26,887
What?

669
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:28,055
I'm not gonna wear it now.

670
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:29,821
In the room. We'll get
changed in the room.

671
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:32,981
<i>You're a low-down,
lying Yankee.</i>

672
00:54:34,189 --> 00:54:35,229
<i>Prove it.</i>

673
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:46,657
This is a very
famous picture, Laura.

674
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:48,536
It's almost 100 years old.

675
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:13,396
<i>In life,
in death, oh, Lord</i>

676
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:18,271
<i>Abide with me</i>

677
00:55:22,112 --> 00:55:24,322
I first saw this picture

678
00:55:24,406 --> 00:55:26,906
at the Essoldo Cinema
in my hometown...

679
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:29,235
when I was your age.

680
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:32,751
<i>...who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name</i>

681
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:36,294
<i>Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done</i>

682
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,262
Shit.

683
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,224
<i>I've heard
that you're a low-down,</i>

684
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:32,966
<i>Yankee liar.</i>

685
00:56:33,141 --> 00:56:34,431
<i>Prove it.</i>

686
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:45,153
You read these
in your spare time?

687
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:48,871
Oh, yeah, Charles,
we got ourselves an <i>X-Men</i> fan.

688
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,534
You do know
they're all bullshit, right?

689
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:54,578
Maybe a quarter of it
happened, and not like this.

690
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,830
In the real world,
people die.

691
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,828
And no self-promoting asshole

692
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:00,417
in a fucking leotard
can stop it.

693
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:02,545
This is ice cream for bed-wetters.
Logan...

694
00:57:02,712 --> 00:57:04,148
Her nurse has been feeding
her some grade-A bullshit.

695
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:05,552
I don't think
Laura needs reminding

696
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:07,052
of life's impermanence.

697
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:10,891
Didn't you say something about
finding us a new ride?

698
00:57:12,222 --> 00:57:14,022
Two more pills
in one hour.

699
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:16,063
Give 'em to him.

700
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:17,944
<i>Why, Shane?</i>

701
00:57:19,229 --> 00:57:21,269
<i>A man has to be
what he is, Joey.</i>

702
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:24,324
<i>Can't break the mold.</i>

703
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:26,824
<i>I tried it
and it didn't work for me.</i>

704
00:57:26,986 --> 00:57:29,316
<i>Joey, there's no living
with a killing.</i>

705
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:31,409
<i>There's no going back
from one.</i>

706
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:33,834
<i>Right or wrong,
it's a brand.</i>

707
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:35,495
<i>A brand sticks.</i>

708
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:37,999
<i>Now you run on home
to your mother,</i>

709
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:39,791
<i>and tell her
everything's all right.</i>

710
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:44,049
<i>And there aren't any more
guns in the valley.</i>

711
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:05,942
Who are you guys?

712
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:07,744
More cops? 'Cause I told

713
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:09,319
the other guys
everything that I...

714
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:21,577
Get up!
In your cage, tracker.

715
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:23,419
You did your job.

716
00:58:45,106 --> 00:58:46,476
Fellas.

717
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,286
Shit.

718
00:59:02,832 --> 00:59:04,172
Knock yourselves out.

719
00:59:06,211 --> 00:59:07,646
I'll tell you what.
Eight grand...

720
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,920
I'll have her freshly painted
for you, new tires...

721
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:11,729
mounted, balanced,
and complete paperwork.

722
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:13,051
I'll give you 10 as-is,

723
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:14,594
if you can forget
the paperwork.

724
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:18,639
Well, you still need new
tires, man, they're bald.

725
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:19,926
How long will that take?

726
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,099
An hour.

727
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:54,716
Jesus.

728
01:00:07,897 --> 01:00:10,227
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

729
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:22,575
Sir, are the keys in...
Sir!

730
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:24,745
You have
the keys in it? Sir!

731
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,840
Shit!

732
01:00:54,402 --> 01:00:56,032
Charles. Charles!

733
01:00:57,155 --> 01:00:58,485
Argh!

734
01:01:28,978 --> 01:01:30,018
<i>Going up.</i>

735
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:49,079
Oh, shit!

736
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:50,453
You all right?

737
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:53,658
We gotta get outta here.

738
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:58,594
I'm so sorry.

739
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:01,634
I'm so sorry.

740
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:29,009
<i>Emergency
personnel are still on scene</i>

741
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:31,663
<i>at Harrah's Casino Hotel
in Oklahoma City...</i>

742
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:33,747
<i>where at least 400 guests
were stricken</i>

743
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:35,669
<i>with temporary paralysis
yesterday.</i>

744
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:37,628
<i>Many are noting
a similarity</i>

745
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,508
<i>to the Westchester incident
over a year ago...</i>

746
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:41,245
<i>that left
over 600 injured...</i>

747
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,689
<i>and took the lives
of seven mutants,</i>

748
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:44,173
<i>including several
of the X-Men.</i>

749
01:04:44,924 --> 01:04:46,054
Knock it off.

750
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:50,428
I said, knock it off!

751
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,176
She's a child, Logan.

752
01:04:54,684 --> 01:04:56,194
And, point of fact,
she's your...

753
01:04:56,352 --> 01:04:58,152
How long has it been
since you took your meds?

754
01:05:00,273 --> 01:05:01,375
Tell me,
how long has it been?

755
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:02,729
I don't know!

756
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:04,741
Two days.

757
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:06,452
You saw
what happened yesterday.

758
01:05:06,529 --> 01:05:07,631
If that shit
had gone on any longer,

759
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:08,735
everyone in that casino...

760
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:11,083
I did what I had to do
to save Laura.

761
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:12,542
You didn't do anything.

762
01:05:12,702 --> 01:05:15,122
You just freaked out
and had a fucking seizure!

763
01:05:15,788 --> 01:05:19,168
I guess you prefer me
pharmaceutically castrated,

764
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,130
rambling on like a lunatic.

765
01:05:21,294 --> 01:05:22,804
So much easier for you.

766
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:24,052
Easier? Jesus!

767
01:05:24,213 --> 01:05:26,423
There is nothing easy
about you, Charles, nothing!

768
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:29,051
Yes, yes, please be
like the rest of the world...

769
01:05:29,218 --> 01:05:31,718
blaming someone else
for your boring shit.

770
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:33,647
I know, Pop, I'm such
a giant disappointment.

771
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:37,729
You honestly derive
no sense of purpose...

772
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:38,943
from what we're doing?

773
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:40,653
Okay, what are we doing?
Hmm?

774
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:44,937
There is a young mutant
sitting in our car.

775
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:46,149
Yeah, I see that.

776
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,529
And where we're taking her,
there are others.

777
01:05:48,696 --> 01:05:50,486
Does that mean nothing
to you?

778
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,486
Yeah, means nothing to me.

779
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:54,237
Especially since
Nurse Gabriela...

780
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,830
made all that Eden shit up
with fucking comic books.

781
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:58,656
What are you
talking about?

782
01:05:58,831 --> 01:05:59,921
Give those to him,
will you?

783
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:01,226
Take out two pills
and give them to him.

784
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,750
Logan! Logan!
Give 'em to him.

785
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,090
Now!

786
01:06:09,008 --> 01:06:10,048
I wanna see it.

787
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:36,036
Dr. Rice.
It's under control...

788
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:05,647
Motherfucking auto-trucks.

789
01:07:05,898 --> 01:07:07,108
Language, Logan.

790
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:09,404
And you're screaming
at a machine.

791
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,318
Oh, what? She can gut a man
with her feet,

792
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:12,923
she can't hear
a few naughty words, huh?

793
01:07:12,947 --> 01:07:15,527
She can learn
to be better.

794
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,160
You mean, better than me?

795
01:07:17,326 --> 01:07:19,036
Actually, yes.

796
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:22,958
And, by the way,
Laura's foot claws...

797
01:07:23,124 --> 01:07:25,714
are the obvious result
of her gender, you know.

798
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,086
Is that a fact?

799
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:29,173
In a pride of lions,
the female...

800
01:07:29,338 --> 01:07:31,798
is both hunter
and caregiver.

801
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:33,046
Good to know.

802
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:35,926
She uses her front claws
for hunting...

803
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:37,425
and the back claws
defensively.

804
01:07:37,513 --> 01:07:38,513
Oh, yeah?

805
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:40,217
Thus,
ensuring their survival.

806
01:07:46,522 --> 01:07:47,652
Hey, hey!

807
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:18,144
We should help them.

808
01:08:19,555 --> 01:08:21,845
No, we have to keep going.
Someone will come along.

809
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:23,676
Someone has come along.

810
01:08:35,404 --> 01:08:37,744
<i>Alert. Alert.</i>

811
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:41,792
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

812
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:22,374
Hey, uh, you need a hand?

813
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:25,664
Ready? Go!

814
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,580
Ah. Good, got it.

815
01:09:31,377 --> 01:09:33,417
Come on, let's get home.
Laura!

816
01:09:33,504 --> 01:09:35,014
Thank you so much
for your help.

817
01:09:35,089 --> 01:09:36,549
I'm Kathryn.
James.

818
01:09:36,715 --> 01:09:37,715
This is my son, Nate.

819
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:39,093
Hi.
Hey.

820
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,680
That's your daughter?

821
01:09:40,845 --> 01:09:43,005
Yeah, that's Laura,
and that's my dad...

822
01:09:43,764 --> 01:09:44,934
Chuck.

823
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:46,057
Come on, Laura, let's go.

824
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,020
Well, can we show
our appreciation

825
01:09:48,102 --> 01:09:49,746
and treat the three of you
to a decent meal?

826
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:51,060
We don't live far from here.

827
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,270
Uh, no, thanks.
That would be lovely!

828
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:02,951
My name is Dr. Rice.

829
01:10:03,242 --> 01:10:04,952
But you can call me Zander
if you like.

830
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:07,623
My colleague tells me

831
01:10:07,705 --> 01:10:10,075
you've been
somewhat resistant.

832
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:12,206
He believes you've been

833
01:10:12,293 --> 01:10:14,043
dispensing
delayed information...

834
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:16,301
to allow your friends
to stay one step ahead.

835
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:20,944
I'm offering you
the possibility

836
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:22,258
of redemption, Caliban.

837
01:10:23,387 --> 01:10:25,217
To protect the world,
and in the process,

838
01:10:25,306 --> 01:10:26,556
save your friends.

839
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:29,984
The girl is a rather
small price to pay for that.

840
01:10:30,144 --> 01:10:31,944
Unlike you, she's impure.

841
01:10:32,104 --> 01:10:33,814
She wasn't made by nature.

842
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:35,151
She's a mistake of my own.

843
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:36,399
I did what I could

844
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:37,743
and they burned me
and beat me.

845
01:10:37,902 --> 01:10:39,612
Your colleagues are savages.

846
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:41,494
I agree.

847
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:43,485
The Reavers
were very ineffective.

848
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:46,577
But I'm bringing
new tools to bear.

849
01:10:46,744 --> 01:10:47,754
But I still need someone

850
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:48,972
to point us
in the right direction.

851
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:50,246
No, I can't help you.

852
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:52,084
Breathe, breathe.

853
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:54,249
Now, what does he have?
The old man.

854
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:56,168
Alzheimer's? ALS?

855
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:58,921
A degenerative brain disease

856
01:10:59,006 --> 01:11:01,426
in the world's most
dangerous brain?

857
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:03,339
What a combo.

858
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,310
<i>Be nice.
Now, you know we got company.</i>

859
01:11:08,474 --> 01:11:09,524
<i>That's wonderful.</i>

860
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:10,923
<i>Everybody, have a seat.</i>

861
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:12,308
<i>Nate, sit up.</i>

862
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:14,164
<i>James, why don't you sit
at the end of the table?</i>

863
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:16,188
<i>You wanna say grace?
Say grace, baby.</i>

864
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:19,777
Uh, thank you, God,
for this food...

865
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:22,994
and for our new friends,
the Howletts.

866
01:11:23,155 --> 01:11:24,445
Mmm. They came
to our aid.

867
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:25,985
Amen.
Amen.

868
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:27,677
Here we go.
Here you go, Charles.

869
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:29,541
Thank you, sir.

870
01:11:44,385 --> 01:11:45,385
Mmm-hmm.

871
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:49,468
Oh, there's plenty more
if she wants.

872
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,230
She's fine. Thank you.

873
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:52,472
This is delicious.

874
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:53,954
- Oh, thank you.
- It's so good.

875
01:11:53,978 --> 01:11:55,348
Where are you all headed?

876
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:56,901
Uh... Oregon.
South Dakota.

877
01:11:58,732 --> 01:11:59,732
Um...

878
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,238
Well, Oregon
and then South Dakota.

879
01:12:02,403 --> 01:12:03,743
Vacation?

880
01:12:03,904 --> 01:12:04,914
Uh... Yes.

881
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:07,072
Uh, long overdue.

882
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:08,491
We're city folk.

883
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:12,079
Always wanted to take a road trip,
see the country.

884
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:14,752
Um... And meet
the people in it.

885
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:16,165
That sounds lovely.

886
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,423
Been trying
to get Will here

887
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:19,043
to take a vacation
for years now.

888
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:20,855
Oh. If we go traipsing
all over the country,

889
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:22,023
who's gonna take care
of this place?

890
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:23,917
Exactly.
I say, let it go.

891
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:25,091
And live off what?

892
01:12:25,259 --> 01:12:27,009
The Lord will provide.

893
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:29,030
I'm still waiting for
the Lord to provide me

894
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:30,264
with a new thresher.

895
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:32,391
All the same,
I'd love to travel someday.

896
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:34,769
And I bet you will.

897
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:36,392
I could drop
out of school.

898
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:37,497
Okay, let's not go
that far.

899
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:38,611
I mean, I'll do it.

900
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:39,972
- No. No.
- Why not?

901
01:12:40,107 --> 01:12:41,437
You wanna travel,
I wanna travel.

902
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:42,525
Son. Son.

903
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:44,087
That sounds good
to you, right?

904
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:45,401
This is the perfect plan.

905
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:46,971
Why would you want
to do that, Nate?

906
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:50,118
Careful, you're speaking to
a man who ran a school...

907
01:12:51,702 --> 01:12:53,122
for a lot of years.
Right, Charles?

908
01:12:53,746 --> 01:12:55,616
Yes, it was a...

909
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:59,418
It was a special needs
school. Um...

910
01:13:00,586 --> 01:13:02,126
Uh-huh.
That's a good description.

911
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,300
He was there, too.

912
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:05,465
Oh, yeah, no. Um...

913
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:06,751
I got kicked out a few times.

914
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:09,546
I wish I could say
you were a good pupil,

915
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:10,926
but the words
would choke me.

916
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:35,577
Ma'am, I can't thank you
enough for this.

917
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:37,002
Uh, it was great.

918
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:38,964
But we have a long drive
ahead of us, so...

919
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:40,364
But you need to rest,
don't you?

920
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:42,057
Yeah, we'll find
a motel somewhere.

921
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:43,146
The nearest one
is two hours from here

922
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,250
and it's not even
that nice.

923
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:46,511
We have a perfectly fine
room upstairs

924
01:13:46,632 --> 01:13:47,776
for your father
and your daughter and

925
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,486
you can sleep in the living
room on the convertible.

926
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,779
Kathryn, it's very,
very nice of you,

927
01:13:50,803 --> 01:13:52,013
but we really should go.

928
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:54,307
We can leave
early in the morning.

929
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:57,773
Break of dawn,
as it were.

930
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:02,439
Okay, why don't we
wash up, Pop?

931
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:03,606
Okay.

932
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:04,690
Sit.

933
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:10,658
Um, sweetie,
you want some dessert?

934
01:14:10,823 --> 01:14:12,123
Two days on the road,

935
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:14,119
only one meal,
and hardly any sleep.

936
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:16,334
She's 11, I'm fucking 90.

937
01:14:16,495 --> 01:14:18,325
Well, that's 101 reasons
to keep moving.

938
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:20,497
I'm not a box
of avocados, Logan.

939
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:22,435
And then what?
We stay the night, then what?

940
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:25,959
Then we take her to
her friends in Eden.

941
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:30,545
And then we buy
the Sunseeker.

942
01:14:32,136 --> 01:14:33,466
Take the pills.

943
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:38,891
Oh, shit!

944
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:42,061
What's going on?
Nate!

945
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:44,229
Go fill up the tub
before we lose pressure.

946
01:14:44,398 --> 01:14:45,728
Honey, check the sink.

947
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:47,319
They shut it off again.

948
01:14:47,985 --> 01:14:49,629
They are just not going to
let this thing go.

949
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:51,133
Well, you might as well
handle it now.

950
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:53,133
It can wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night.

951
01:14:53,157 --> 01:14:54,487
We got three houseguests

952
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:55,615
and a sink full of dishes.

953
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:57,372
All right, all right.

954
01:14:58,245 --> 01:14:59,655
The pump station
that supplies us

955
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:00,946
is a mile
and a half from here.

956
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:02,876
Sometimes it gets itself
shut off.

957
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,041
- By assholes.
- Hey!

958
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:05,209
No.

959
01:15:05,586 --> 01:15:07,496
My son is happy
to go with you.

960
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,421
No, no, no,
that's fine.

961
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,430
The men that do this,
sometimes they can be...

962
01:15:11,592 --> 01:15:13,342
I can go.
No, you got homework.

963
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,010
All right, I'll go.

964
01:15:15,179 --> 01:15:16,889
Just, uh,
let me get my dad settled.

965
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:21,726
All right.

966
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:25,765
I'm just saying,
I don't care what the lawyer says.

967
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:29,228
But it's dangerous.

968
01:15:29,902 --> 01:15:31,402
I'm not gonna hurt
our chances.

969
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:46,629
Want TV? There's TV here.

970
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:47,793
I'm fine.

971
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,050
Okay. Get some rest.

972
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:51,129
You know, Logan...

973
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:53,875
this is what life
looks like.

974
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:56,931
A home,
people who love each other.

975
01:15:57,095 --> 01:15:58,255
Safe place.

976
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,970
You should
take a moment and feel it.

977
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,770
Yeah. It's great.

978
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:07,478
Logan. Logan!

979
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:11,571
You still have time.

980
01:16:14,112 --> 01:16:18,242
Charles, the world is not
the same as it was.

981
01:16:20,661 --> 01:16:23,331
We're taking a risk hanging
around here, you know that.

982
01:16:23,914 --> 01:16:26,584
And where
we're going, Eden...

983
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:28,839
it doesn't exist.

984
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:31,923
Her nurse got it
from a comic book.

985
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:36,179
You understand?
It's not real.

986
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:38,933
It is for Laura.

987
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:45,186
It is for Laura.

988
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:49,476
Get some rest.

989
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,945
Canewood Beverage bought up
everything out here,

990
01:16:55,028 --> 01:16:56,198
except for us.

991
01:16:56,363 --> 01:16:58,993
When we wouldn't sell,
they tried eminent domain...

992
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:00,777
then screwing
with our water.

993
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:04,285
Couple of months ago,
somebody poisoned our dogs.

994
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:07,541
So, out on the highway
today, those trucks...

995
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,210
Who knows. Maybe.

996
01:17:11,378 --> 01:17:13,378
Hey, look at 'em.

997
01:17:13,964 --> 01:17:15,804
Look like dinosaurs
with their 20-ton bodies

998
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:17,222
and tiny little brains...

999
01:17:17,384 --> 01:17:19,554
shucking their cloned-up
super corn.

1000
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,040
You know it tastes
like shit, too.

1001
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:22,388
Why do people eat it?

1002
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:24,886
They don't. They drink it.
Corn syrup.

1003
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:26,858
It's in those drinks
that everyone's having...

1004
01:17:26,977 --> 01:17:30,557
to stay awake, cheer up,
feel strong, sexy, whatever.

1005
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:33,571
Used to be a time when a bad
day was just a bad day.

1006
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:35,154
Mine still are.

1007
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,840
Those are for
breakaway roping.

1008
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,677
Those are for
barrel racing...

1009
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:04,929
and right here
is for pole bending.

1010
01:18:05,098 --> 01:18:06,928
They're all second,
third place.

1011
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,730
I'm not too good at it,
but my dad makes me.

1012
01:18:19,446 --> 01:18:21,406
Do you want to listen?

1013
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:32,788
Do you like it?

1014
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:39,085
Um, here, you can
take it for tonight...

1015
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:42,297
and I'll get it back
from you in the morning.

1016
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:57,228
Looks like we're gonna
be here a while.

1017
01:19:30,684 --> 01:19:31,984
Should hold it.

1018
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:33,274
Yeah.

1019
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,110
Till next time.

1020
01:19:35,689 --> 01:19:36,819
Thanks.

1021
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:41,105
Hey, so, uh,
how long has your girl

1022
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:42,824
been like that?
Huh?

1023
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:44,356
Mute.

1024
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:48,488
Uh, since the beginning.

1025
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:50,035
Mmm.

1026
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,710
Well, in a lot of ways,
I envy you.

1027
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:54,960
They get to be Nate's age,

1028
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,041
with the nonsense that comes
out of their mouths...

1029
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:00,301
Makes you wonder the
whole point of it all.

1030
01:20:02,674 --> 01:20:04,224
Shit.

1031
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:09,388
Don't worry.

1032
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:11,016
We won't need it.

1033
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:12,475
Stay here.

1034
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,190
Evening, Mr. Munson.

1035
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:22,775
What brings y'all
this way?

1036
01:20:23,904 --> 01:20:25,324
Why don't you ask
your boys?

1037
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:26,659
Mr. Munson,

1038
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,468
you understand you're
trespassing right now, right?

1039
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:30,052
I have an easement with
the previous owner

1040
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:31,076
of your property.

1041
01:20:31,161 --> 01:20:32,501
Huh. Bullshit.

1042
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:34,662
"Previous" being
the operative word.

1043
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:37,084
Who's this?

1044
01:20:38,418 --> 01:20:39,418
Just a guy telling you

1045
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:40,924
to get back
in your nice truck.

1046
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:43,757
Go play Okie dickhead
somewhere else.

1047
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,260
Hey, Carl...

1048
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:53,183
it looks like Mr. Munson
hired some muscle.

1049
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:54,680
Looks that way.

1050
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,271
He's a friend of mine.

1051
01:20:56,436 --> 01:20:58,096
A friend with a big mouth.

1052
01:20:58,438 --> 01:20:59,688
I hear that a lot.

1053
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:01,496
Then you probably
hear this, too.

1054
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:05,609
More than I'd like.

1055
01:21:05,779 --> 01:21:06,949
Then you know the drill.

1056
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:09,954
I'mma count to three...

1057
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:11,516
and you're gonna
start walking away.

1058
01:21:11,618 --> 01:21:12,658
I got rights
to this water.

1059
01:21:12,702 --> 01:21:13,872
One.
I have a lawyer now.

1060
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:14,964
Two.

1061
01:21:16,623 --> 01:21:18,043
Three.
Ah. Ah.

1062
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,541
You all right, boss?

1063
01:21:22,295 --> 01:21:24,106
- You know the drill.
- Pick up my goddamn hat.

1064
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,130
Get the hell out of here.

1065
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:27,128
You okay, boss?
Fuck off.

1066
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:28,217
Go!

1067
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:46,738
You've had training.

1068
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:48,277
Some.

1069
01:22:08,008 --> 01:22:10,138
Hey, don't wake her yet.

1070
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:12,930
Let her sleep another hour.

1071
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:19,017
You know, Logan...

1072
01:22:20,687 --> 01:22:23,687
this was, without a doubt...

1073
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:29,816
the most perfect night
I've had in a very long time.

1074
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:39,869
But I don't deserve it.

1075
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,041
Do I?

1076
01:22:46,463 --> 01:22:48,803
I did something.

1077
01:22:51,468 --> 01:22:53,888
Something unspeakable.

1078
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:03,399
I've remembered
what happened in Westchester.

1079
01:23:08,026 --> 01:23:11,356
This is not the first time
I've hurt people.

1080
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:16,655
Until today, I didn't know.

1081
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:19,577
You wouldn't tell me.

1082
01:23:21,748 --> 01:23:27,748
So we just kept on
running away from it.

1083
01:23:32,175 --> 01:23:35,885
I think I finally
understand you.

1084
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:40,555
Logan...

1085
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:09,634
He's fantastic.

1086
01:24:09,796 --> 01:24:11,126
You said you only needed
the girl!

1087
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:13,427
I told you I was forced
to bring a new tool to bear.

1088
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:14,801
Your friends
had every chance.

1089
01:24:14,968 --> 01:24:16,138
And so did you.

1090
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:18,393
Nate?

1091
01:24:22,142 --> 01:24:23,482
Put her down.

1092
01:24:31,943 --> 01:24:32,993
Honey.

1093
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:35,106
Stay down there, Will!

1094
01:24:37,449 --> 01:24:38,449
Stop!

1095
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:40,857
Kathryn!

1096
01:24:41,411 --> 01:24:42,638
Kathryn!

1097
01:24:42,662 --> 01:24:44,002
Kathryn!

1098
01:25:12,484 --> 01:25:13,534
Charles!

1099
01:25:14,611 --> 01:25:15,781
Charles!

1100
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,125
Hold this.

1101
01:25:30,293 --> 01:25:32,463
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.

1102
01:25:35,048 --> 01:25:36,048
Here he comes.

1103
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:38,126
I could pick him up,

1104
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:39,218
meet him halfway.

1105
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:40,845
No, no, no.
Let them come to us.

1106
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:43,142
We struggled
with the X-23s.

1107
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:44,533
We assumed,
because they were children...

1108
01:25:44,557 --> 01:25:45,993
we could raise them
without a conscience.

1109
01:25:46,017 --> 01:25:47,887
But you can't nurture rage.

1110
01:25:48,061 --> 01:25:49,231
You must simply design it...

1111
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:50,395
from scratch.

1112
01:25:58,071 --> 01:26:00,411
Who the fuck is that?

1113
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:06,578
Will Munson!

1114
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:11,169
Just hold on, Charles.

1115
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:13,921
Munson,
God damn it, come out here!

1116
01:26:18,258 --> 01:26:19,258
Munson!

1117
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:22,430
Come out here now!

1118
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:24,761
Come out here now, Munson.

1119
01:26:24,931 --> 01:26:26,221
There's that asshole.

1120
01:26:28,226 --> 01:26:29,556
Hello, asshole.

1121
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:32,607
Listen, I'm willing
to let bygones be bygones.

1122
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:34,769
I don't know what
Munson's paying you...

1123
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:37,938
but Canewood can start
you out at five G.

1124
01:26:38,069 --> 01:26:39,109
A week, that is.

1125
01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:43,374
You best stay
where you are, pal.

1126
01:26:43,533 --> 01:26:45,293
I'm the law out here.

1127
01:26:46,119 --> 01:26:47,869
No, no, no.

1128
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:50,247
What in high...

1129
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:53,878
What? Oh, shit!

1130
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:55,043
Shoot him!

1131
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:58,126
We need to intervene.

1132
01:26:58,298 --> 01:27:00,548
Well, he only listens
to you, Doctor.

1133
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:04,599
24!

1134
01:27:05,889 --> 01:27:06,889
Get back here!

1135
01:27:07,974 --> 01:27:09,144
Stop! Stop now!

1136
01:27:09,309 --> 01:27:11,139
Hold this down,
right now, tight!

1137
01:27:15,565 --> 01:27:17,315
Our boat.
What?

1138
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,905
The Sunseeker.

1139
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:35,594
No.

1140
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:45,469
Come!

1141
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:46,798
24!

1142
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,100
Need some help
out here!

1143
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:51,619
I guess we're gonna have to
take care of this now.

1144
01:27:51,643 --> 01:27:53,163
- Pierce!
- Give me that.

1145
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:54,991
Get your lily-faced
ass out here!

1146
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:02,364
Listen to me!

1147
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:04,088
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

1148
01:28:04,197 --> 01:28:06,117
All right,
we gotta go around that truck

1149
01:28:06,199 --> 01:28:07,489
and flank them farmers.

1150
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:08,949
Follow my lead.

1151
01:28:09,035 --> 01:28:10,945
Bring extra ammo,
take these clips.

1152
01:28:11,037 --> 01:28:12,077
Come!

1153
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,540
Now!

1154
01:28:14,374 --> 01:28:15,714
Pick her up.

1155
01:28:26,552 --> 01:28:27,722
Beware the light.

1156
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:52,330
What the hell are you?

1157
01:31:19,308 --> 01:31:20,558
Sit down.

1158
01:31:39,871 --> 01:31:41,161
Hold still.

1159
01:31:41,581 --> 01:31:42,921
Hold still.

1160
01:32:04,937 --> 01:32:06,057
Get him on the truck.

1161
01:32:06,105 --> 01:32:07,105
Yeah.

1162
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:10,034
Go.

1163
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:17,530
It's all right,
it's all right.

1164
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:20,620
It's all right.
You did fine, 24.

1165
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:22,746
You're healing.
Just breathe.

1166
01:32:24,123 --> 01:32:26,633
You're a newborn,
by any measure.

1167
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:28,092
Just breathe.

1168
01:32:28,419 --> 01:32:29,499
Your body has work to do.

1169
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:32,260
Hemostasis, angiogenesis,
epithelialization...

1170
01:32:32,423 --> 01:32:33,763
stromal cell proliferation.

1171
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:37,425
This will help you heal.

1172
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:39,814
Make you stronger.

1173
01:33:34,902 --> 01:33:36,072
Well...

1174
01:33:42,034 --> 01:33:43,874
It's got water, and...

1175
01:34:06,892 --> 01:34:08,232
It's got water.

1176
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:27,408
Fuck this. Fuck this.

1177
01:34:40,843 --> 01:34:42,013
God!

1178
01:34:48,309 --> 01:34:50,099
Fuck! Fuck!

1179
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:51,267
Fuck!

1180
01:34:51,937 --> 01:34:52,937
Shit!

1181
01:35:05,618 --> 01:35:06,788
Fuck! Fuck!

1182
01:35:08,579 --> 01:35:10,119
Fuck!

1183
01:35:10,289 --> 01:35:11,919
Motherfucking...

1184
01:35:16,253 --> 01:35:17,303
Shit!

1185
01:35:18,464 --> 01:35:20,514
Fuck! Fuck!

1186
01:35:48,369 --> 01:35:49,949
Welcome back.

1187
01:35:50,621 --> 01:35:52,516
I was starting to think
I was gonna have to tell...

1188
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:54,420
that nice little girl
out in the waiting room...

1189
01:35:54,542 --> 01:35:56,042
her daddy's gone.

1190
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:03,384
I'd always hoped...

1191
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:08,636
that I'd get the chance
to meet someone like you.

1192
01:36:09,014 --> 01:36:10,684
There's so few of you left.

1193
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:15,345
Nice to meet you, too, Doc.

1194
01:36:15,521 --> 01:36:16,832
But I really
got to get on my way.

1195
01:36:16,856 --> 01:36:18,066
No, no, don't do that.

1196
01:36:18,232 --> 01:36:20,692
What you need is rest,
and treatment.

1197
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:22,379
You need to check yourself
in somewhere.

1198
01:36:22,403 --> 01:36:23,573
I'll be fine.

1199
01:36:23,696 --> 01:36:24,856
No, you're not!

1200
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:28,030
I mean, I know
that you're different...

1201
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,440
but that doesn't
change the fact

1202
01:36:29,493 --> 01:36:31,503
that something inside you
is poisoning you.

1203
01:36:31,662 --> 01:36:33,872
You got to check yourself
into a hospital.

1204
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:35,709
Find out what it is!

1205
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:37,377
I know what it is.

1206
01:36:38,252 --> 01:36:40,502
Please, mister, if you don't
want to go to a hospital,

1207
01:36:40,588 --> 01:36:41,588
maybe I can help you.

1208
01:36:41,755 --> 01:36:43,005
Maybe I can run
some tests.

1209
01:36:43,174 --> 01:36:45,554
Look, Doc. You seem
like a nice guy, all right?

1210
01:36:45,718 --> 01:36:47,388
You wanna save a life,
save your own.

1211
01:36:47,553 --> 01:36:48,603
Forget we were here.

1212
01:36:48,762 --> 01:36:49,852
Let's go.

1213
01:37:01,025 --> 01:37:02,025
Hey!

1214
01:37:02,568 --> 01:37:03,568
Hey!

1215
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:26,089
You can't just take shit,
you know.

1216
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:46,820
I don't know
how you got me here...

1217
01:37:47,613 --> 01:37:48,783
but thank you.

1218
01:37:48,864 --> 01:37:49,874
<i>De nada.</i>

1219
01:37:50,074 --> 01:37:51,244
Yeah.

1220
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:54,448
You can talk?

1221
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:57,830
You can talk?

1222
01:37:58,666 --> 01:38:00,416
What the fuck?

1223
01:38:00,626 --> 01:38:01,746
Why in the fuck...

1224
01:38:01,919 --> 01:38:02,938
What's all this
bullshit been

1225
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:04,922
for the last
2,000 fucking miles?

1226
01:38:07,925 --> 01:38:09,585
What? Shut up.

1227
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:10,930
Shut the fuck up!

1228
01:38:11,011 --> 01:38:13,721
Jonah, Gideon,
Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor.

1229
01:38:13,806 --> 01:38:16,096
What? Who's that?

1230
01:38:16,267 --> 01:38:17,427
Who is that?

1231
01:38:18,811 --> 01:38:22,361
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca,
Delilah, and Rictor.

1232
01:38:22,856 --> 01:38:23,896
North Dakota.

1233
01:38:24,858 --> 01:38:26,148
What?

1234
01:38:26,277 --> 01:38:27,647
North Dakota, <i>por favor.</i>

1235
01:38:27,778 --> 01:38:28,948
Shit, okay. Look...

1236
01:38:29,029 --> 01:38:30,199
No<i>. Por favor.</i>

1237
01:38:31,824 --> 01:38:33,494
This place. Okay?

1238
01:38:33,659 --> 01:38:34,789
Your nurse,

1239
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:37,158
she read too many stories,
you understand?

1240
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:38,869
Too many stories!

1241
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:45,500
I've seen it!
I've seen it, okay?

1242
01:38:45,671 --> 01:38:46,801
This all here...

1243
01:38:46,964 --> 01:38:48,974
None of this...
No <i>existo,</i> okay?

1244
01:38:49,049 --> 01:38:50,049
You understand me?

1245
01:38:50,217 --> 01:38:51,507
This Eden
does not exist. No!

1246
01:38:51,677 --> 01:38:52,967
<i>Si!</i> Eden!

1247
01:38:53,137 --> 01:38:54,967
It's a fantasy, kid.
See that?

1248
01:38:55,139 --> 01:38:56,157
Those are the names
of the people

1249
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:57,981
who just made this...

1250
01:38:58,058 --> 01:38:59,848
They made this
whole thing up.

1251
01:39:00,352 --> 01:39:01,652
Okay? This whole...

1252
01:39:01,812 --> 01:39:02,812
It happened once,

1253
01:39:02,855 --> 01:39:04,735
and they just turned it
into a big, fucking lie!

1254
01:39:06,066 --> 01:39:07,186
That's all this is. No!

1255
01:39:07,901 --> 01:39:09,031
Fuck.

1256
01:39:09,862 --> 01:39:10,992
No.

1257
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,368
I know, I understand.

1258
01:39:13,741 --> 01:39:15,661
This is a long way.

1259
01:39:15,826 --> 01:39:16,826
You understand?

1260
01:39:16,869 --> 01:39:19,249
I am not taking you
to North Dakota.

1261
01:39:22,416 --> 01:39:25,706
I am fucked up.
And I cannot get you there.

1262
01:39:25,878 --> 01:39:29,008
It is a two-day drive.
And I am not taking you...

1263
01:39:29,173 --> 01:39:31,883
Don't fucking hit me!

1264
01:39:32,051 --> 01:39:33,051
Don't hit me!

1265
01:39:33,886 --> 01:39:35,046
Jonah, Gideon...

1266
01:39:35,179 --> 01:39:36,323
Stop saying those names.
...Rebecca...

1267
01:39:36,347 --> 01:39:37,347
Delilah, Rictor.

1268
01:39:37,431 --> 01:39:38,931
Right now.
Stop saying those names.

1269
01:39:39,058 --> 01:39:40,228
Stop it! Stop!

1270
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:41,521
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca...

1271
01:39:41,685 --> 01:39:44,055
Fuck it. Fine, fine.

1272
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:46,191
You wanna go?

1273
01:39:46,273 --> 01:39:48,113
I'll take you there.

1274
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:50,067
See for yourself.

1275
01:39:50,402 --> 01:39:52,662
Let's go to
fucking fantasyland.

1276
01:40:05,584 --> 01:40:06,936
<i>We understand
the importance</i>

1277
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:07,960
<i>of containment, Dr. Rice.</i>

1278
01:40:08,253 --> 01:40:09,397
But you can't leave
a war zone behind

1279
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:10,421
like you did in Juarez.

1280
01:40:10,589 --> 01:40:11,749
Well, try to
remind yourselves

1281
01:40:11,799 --> 01:40:13,193
that these are all
little killing machines.

1282
01:40:13,217 --> 01:40:15,236
Machines who would've happily
disemboweled your family.

1283
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,260
Not all.

1284
01:40:17,429 --> 01:40:19,259
I was told you want
these assets off-board,

1285
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:20,470
dead or alive.

1286
01:40:20,641 --> 01:40:21,891
Are you changing my brief?

1287
01:40:22,059 --> 01:40:23,099
No.

1288
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:24,600
All right, then.

1289
01:40:26,438 --> 01:40:27,558
Save tissue from this one.

1290
01:40:27,731 --> 01:40:29,821
He's a good tracker
and had a high IQ.

1291
01:40:35,239 --> 01:40:36,619
Here you go.

1292
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,360
Hey.

1293
01:41:22,161 --> 01:41:23,161
Hmm?

1294
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:24,660
Let me drive.

1295
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:28,631
Absolutely not.

1296
01:41:34,298 --> 01:41:35,838
Quit looking at me.

1297
01:41:40,262 --> 01:41:41,512
<i>No comprende.</i>

1298
01:41:43,015 --> 01:41:44,515
You are dying.

1299
01:41:47,394 --> 01:41:48,854
You want to die.

1300
01:41:51,732 --> 01:41:53,232
Charles told me.

1301
01:41:56,361 --> 01:41:58,571
What else did he tell you?

1302
01:41:59,031 --> 01:42:00,571
To not let you.

1303
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:14,551
Hey, hey, hey!

1304
01:42:21,762 --> 01:42:22,762
Rest.

1305
01:45:07,344 --> 01:45:08,854
Keep it steady.

1306
01:45:11,181 --> 01:45:12,771
Swing him toward me.

1307
01:45:15,268 --> 01:45:16,268
Yeah.

1308
01:45:18,855 --> 01:45:21,065
Easy. Easy

1309
01:45:54,266 --> 01:45:55,976
Is this good, Rictor?

1310
01:45:56,435 --> 01:45:57,635
No, not so much. Less.

1311
01:46:03,942 --> 01:46:05,402
Hey!

1312
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:13,240
Where am I?

1313
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:16,790
Hey, what is it?

1314
01:46:17,164 --> 01:46:18,464
Where did you get that?

1315
01:46:18,623 --> 01:46:19,963
Where we came from.

1316
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:21,625
They gave it to us

1317
01:46:21,668 --> 01:46:22,812
when we would fight.
It makes you stronger.

1318
01:46:22,836 --> 01:46:24,626
It makes you crazy,
is what it does.

1319
01:46:24,755 --> 01:46:25,755
It'll kill you.

1320
01:46:25,839 --> 01:46:27,839
No, not if you use it
in small doses.

1321
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:29,798
It's helping you heal.

1322
01:46:31,303 --> 01:46:32,643
Where's Laura?

1323
01:46:32,804 --> 01:46:34,774
She's asleep down there.

1324
01:46:34,931 --> 01:46:36,811
Do you want me
to wake her up?

1325
01:46:44,441 --> 01:46:45,651
No.

1326
01:47:06,838 --> 01:47:08,548
You had a nightmare.

1327
01:47:12,385 --> 01:47:14,175
Do you have nightmares?

1328
01:47:15,472 --> 01:47:16,472
<i>Si.</i>

1329
01:47:19,559 --> 01:47:21,309
People hurt me.

1330
01:47:23,355 --> 01:47:24,855
Mine are different.

1331
01:47:31,029 --> 01:47:32,489
I hurt people.

1332
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,880
You know what it is.

1333
01:47:53,718 --> 01:47:55,598
It's made
out of Adamantium.

1334
01:47:56,388 --> 01:47:58,598
It's what they put
inside of us.

1335
01:47:59,558 --> 01:48:01,348
That's why it can kill us.

1336
01:48:03,186 --> 01:48:05,516
Probably what is
killing me now.

1337
01:48:07,566 --> 01:48:08,856
Anyway...

1338
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:11,192
I got this
a long time ago...

1339
01:48:12,571 --> 01:48:16,071
and I kept it as a reminder
of what I am.

1340
01:48:18,285 --> 01:48:20,245
Now I keep it to, uh...

1341
01:48:27,127 --> 01:48:28,417
Actually, uh...

1342
01:48:31,882 --> 01:48:34,132
I was thinking of
shooting myself with it.

1343
01:48:34,759 --> 01:48:36,259
Like Charles said.

1344
01:48:41,975 --> 01:48:43,935
I've hurt people, too.

1345
01:48:46,938 --> 01:48:49,768
You're gonna have to learn
how to live with that.

1346
01:48:59,326 --> 01:49:01,326
They were bad people.

1347
01:49:05,123 --> 01:49:06,793
All the same.

1348
01:50:21,825 --> 01:50:24,075
Not funny.
That is not funny!

1349
01:50:25,704 --> 01:50:27,044
Hey! Hey, pal.

1350
01:50:27,205 --> 01:50:29,535
How long have I been out?

1351
01:50:31,167 --> 01:50:32,447
How long have I been
in that bed?

1352
01:50:32,544 --> 01:50:33,844
Two days.

1353
01:50:34,004 --> 01:50:35,314
You've been sitting here
for two days?

1354
01:50:35,338 --> 01:50:36,899
Hey, go inside and tell
everyone to get packing.

1355
01:50:36,923 --> 01:50:38,643
You can't do that.
You can't just stay here.

1356
01:50:38,675 --> 01:50:40,545
We had to wait.
It was the plan.

1357
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:43,049
And everyone had till today
to find their way here.

1358
01:50:43,221 --> 01:50:44,221
If you keep waiting,

1359
01:50:44,264 --> 01:50:45,866
Alkali will find you
and they will kill you all.

1360
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:46,930
You need to get out!

1361
01:50:47,017 --> 01:50:49,097
We're leaving tomorrow
before dawn.

1362
01:50:49,519 --> 01:50:51,099
We're gonna cross
the border.

1363
01:50:51,271 --> 01:50:52,901
It's a safe haven.

1364
01:50:54,107 --> 01:50:55,357
Same coordinates?

1365
01:50:55,525 --> 01:50:57,735
<i>Yes, between noon and 5:00.</i>

1366
01:50:57,902 --> 01:51:00,242
<i>Satellites are blind then.</i>

1367
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:01,485
<i>Your asylum approved.</i>

1368
01:51:01,614 --> 01:51:02,704
Copy.

1369
01:51:18,757 --> 01:51:20,427
Swing it
to your right, Laura.

1370
01:51:23,928 --> 01:51:25,758
A little more. Yeah.

1371
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:27,270
You see the woods?

1372
01:51:29,392 --> 01:51:30,482
<i>Si.</i>

1373
01:51:31,061 --> 01:51:32,541
It's an eight mile hike
through there.

1374
01:51:33,646 --> 01:51:34,766
And you see that pass?

1375
01:51:34,939 --> 01:51:36,109
Mm-hmm.

1376
01:51:36,274 --> 01:51:37,404
That's the border.

1377
01:51:39,277 --> 01:51:41,107
That's where
we will be safe.

1378
01:51:48,411 --> 01:51:49,951
Come inside.

1379
01:51:56,795 --> 01:51:58,335
Laura told me
all that you did for her.

1380
01:51:58,797 --> 01:52:00,837
She was lucky to have you.

1381
01:52:03,301 --> 01:52:05,261
Take it.
She says it's yours.

1382
01:52:07,138 --> 01:52:09,678
That's why
you did it, right?

1383
01:52:11,935 --> 01:52:13,685
Yeah, well...

1384
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:17,319
Look, I don't need it.
You do, okay?

1385
01:52:17,649 --> 01:52:19,319
Suit yourself.

1386
01:52:40,964 --> 01:52:42,634
Your friends,
they seem nice.

1387
01:52:42,799 --> 01:52:43,839
Kind of reminds me...

1388
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:46,970
Hey, hey,
what's going on?

1389
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:48,470
Huh?

1390
01:52:50,014 --> 01:52:51,394
You're with your pals.
You made it.

1391
01:52:52,392 --> 01:52:53,892
Where will you go?

1392
01:52:55,019 --> 01:52:56,519
Nearest bar, for starters.

1393
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:00,316
Hey, I got you here.
That's all I signed up for.

1394
01:53:00,483 --> 01:53:02,363
I even gave back
the money.

1395
01:53:02,527 --> 01:53:03,567
Such a nice man.

1396
01:53:03,695 --> 01:53:05,855
Hey, I never asked
for this!

1397
01:53:06,573 --> 01:53:08,373
All right?
Charles never asked for this.

1398
01:53:08,533 --> 01:53:10,413
Caliban never asked for this.

1399
01:53:11,202 --> 01:53:13,252
And they are six feet
under the ground!

1400
01:53:14,372 --> 01:53:16,372
Now, I don't know what
Charles put in your head...

1401
01:53:16,541 --> 01:53:19,341
but I am not whatever it is
you think I am, okay?

1402
01:53:20,712 --> 01:53:23,012
I only met you,
like, a week ago.

1403
01:53:24,215 --> 01:53:26,175
You got your Rebecca,
your Delilah...

1404
01:53:26,342 --> 01:53:28,052
your blah, blah, blah,
whatever.

1405
01:53:28,219 --> 01:53:29,849
Everything you asked for,
you've got it!

1406
01:53:32,891 --> 01:53:34,771
And it is better this way.

1407
01:53:36,227 --> 01:53:38,187
Because I suck at this.

1408
01:53:39,898 --> 01:53:43,028
Bad shit happens to people
I care about.

1409
01:53:43,193 --> 01:53:44,863
You understand me?

1410
01:53:46,946 --> 01:53:48,446
Then I'll be fine.

1411
01:55:56,451 --> 01:55:59,371
Run!
Towards the mountains! Run!

1412
01:57:09,482 --> 01:57:10,782
Run, Bobby, run!

1413
01:57:15,947 --> 01:57:16,947
Ah!

1414
01:57:34,882 --> 01:57:36,382
Go! Go!

1415
01:57:37,009 --> 01:57:38,009
Move faster!

1416
01:57:38,177 --> 01:57:40,257
We need to reach them before
they get to the border.

1417
01:58:57,089 --> 01:58:58,339
Move out!

1418
01:58:58,508 --> 01:58:59,508
Let's go, let's go!

1419
01:59:01,344 --> 01:59:02,804
Run! Run!

1420
01:59:02,970 --> 01:59:05,560
<i>Corre,</i> Jonah! Run!

1421
01:59:12,146 --> 01:59:13,686
I want you to breathe.

1422
01:59:13,856 --> 01:59:15,146
It's just
a flesh wound, baby.

1423
01:59:31,415 --> 01:59:32,415
There she is.

1424
01:59:32,625 --> 01:59:33,665
We got her.

1425
01:59:36,379 --> 01:59:38,459
Back it up! Contain her.

1426
02:00:05,074 --> 02:00:06,124
Get behind me!

1427
02:00:27,638 --> 02:00:29,428
You took all the medicine.

1428
02:00:31,017 --> 02:00:32,227
It's wearing off.

1429
02:00:59,003 --> 02:01:00,343
Go to your friends.

1430
02:01:01,589 --> 02:01:02,589
Go.

1431
02:01:04,091 --> 02:01:05,221
Laura?

1432
02:01:07,219 --> 02:01:08,549
You'll know when.

1433
02:01:20,691 --> 02:01:21,941
Nine o'clock.

1434
02:01:23,986 --> 02:01:26,236
That green juice
is wearin' off, huh?

1435
02:01:27,239 --> 02:01:29,779
You know, for an old mute,
it's kind of a short high.

1436
02:01:30,242 --> 02:01:31,792
Be hard to
keep them claws out, soon.

1437
02:01:31,953 --> 02:01:33,793
Waste this dick, Logan!

1438
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:36,749
Please stop,
Mr. Howlett.

1439
02:01:37,208 --> 02:01:38,310
I'm gonna have to
tell these men

1440
02:01:38,334 --> 02:01:39,384
to fire
on these children.

1441
02:01:39,543 --> 02:01:40,883
You don't want that.

1442
02:01:41,045 --> 02:01:43,375
You can see the effects of
the serum are wearing off.

1443
02:01:43,547 --> 02:01:46,127
You will not survive
further wounds.

1444
02:01:46,384 --> 02:01:47,934
Allow me to
introduce myself.

1445
02:01:48,302 --> 02:01:49,302
I'm Zander Rice.

1446
02:01:50,471 --> 02:01:52,561
I believe you knew my father
on the Weapon X Program.

1447
02:01:52,723 --> 02:01:56,273
Yeah. He's the asshole
who put this poison in me.

1448
02:01:57,311 --> 02:01:58,771
Yes, he was one of them.

1449
02:02:00,189 --> 02:02:01,939
I think
I might have killed him.

1450
02:02:03,275 --> 02:02:04,395
I think you're right.

1451
02:02:04,485 --> 02:02:06,005
Why don't you show
some respect, mutie?

1452
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:08,030
You're lookin' at the man
who wiped out your kind.

1453
02:02:08,614 --> 02:02:10,534
My friend Donald overstates.

1454
02:02:11,575 --> 02:02:14,285
He makes it sound more brutal
than intended.

1455
02:02:14,453 --> 02:02:17,713
The goal was
not to end mutant kind...

1456
02:02:17,873 --> 02:02:19,173
but to control it.

1457
02:02:21,293 --> 02:02:22,423
I realized

1458
02:02:22,503 --> 02:02:24,147
we needn't stop perfecting
what we eat and drink.

1459
02:02:24,171 --> 02:02:25,232
That we could use
those products

1460
02:02:25,256 --> 02:02:26,296
to perfect ourselves.

1461
02:02:27,425 --> 02:02:28,715
To distribute gene therapy

1462
02:02:28,801 --> 02:02:30,141
discreetly
through everything...

1463
02:02:30,302 --> 02:02:32,512
from sweet drinks
to breakfast cereals.

1464
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:33,810
And it worked.

1465
02:02:33,973 --> 02:02:36,483
Random mutancy
went the way of polio.

1466
02:02:36,642 --> 02:02:37,942
We embarked
on our next endeavor.

1467
02:02:38,144 --> 02:02:39,774
Growing mutants of your own.

1468
02:02:39,937 --> 02:02:40,998
Precisely.
Dangerous times, James.

1469
02:02:41,022 --> 02:02:42,022
You can't...

1470
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:43,520
Argh!

1471
02:02:44,525 --> 02:02:45,885
Argh!

1472
02:03:01,042 --> 02:03:02,042
Showtime, boy!

1473
02:03:38,746 --> 02:03:40,616
Get up, boy.
Get up, boy!

1474
02:03:45,544 --> 02:03:46,754
He did that. Get up!

1475
02:04:00,101 --> 02:04:01,771
Laura! No!

1476
02:04:06,816 --> 02:04:07,816
Laura!

1477
02:04:55,281 --> 02:04:56,281
Please.

1478
02:05:31,192 --> 02:05:32,192
Ah!

1479
02:05:39,742 --> 02:05:40,782
Go.

1480
02:05:42,578 --> 02:05:43,578
Let's go.

1481
02:05:44,121 --> 02:05:45,121
Go.

1482
02:05:46,582 --> 02:05:48,082
Go, go, go!

1483
02:05:48,792 --> 02:05:51,002
Go! Get out of here! Go!

1484
02:05:54,715 --> 02:05:56,835
Go. Go, go, go!

1485
02:06:01,263 --> 02:06:02,683
Go, go!

1486
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:03,930
Go!

1487
02:06:04,308 --> 02:06:05,348
Run!

1488
02:06:05,559 --> 02:06:06,559
No!

1489
02:06:07,394 --> 02:06:08,854
No!

1490
02:06:46,517 --> 02:06:47,977
No, no. No.

1491
02:07:12,918 --> 02:07:14,628
Take your friends, and run.

1492
02:07:14,795 --> 02:07:16,005
No.

1493
02:07:16,714 --> 02:07:19,344
Run. They'll keep
coming and coming.

1494
02:07:19,508 --> 02:07:22,178
Listen, you don't have
to fight anymore.

1495
02:07:26,432 --> 02:07:28,522
Go, go.

1496
02:07:36,066 --> 02:07:38,106
Don't be what they made you.

1497
02:07:46,118 --> 02:07:48,328
Laura... Laura...

1498
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:53,880
Daddy.

1499
02:08:01,342 --> 02:08:05,762
So, this is what
it feels like.

1500
02:08:08,015 --> 02:08:09,015
No!

1501
02:08:16,899 --> 02:08:17,899
No!

1502
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:32,710
Daddy.

1503
02:08:33,415 --> 02:08:34,415
Dad.

1504
02:09:06,323 --> 02:09:09,163
"A man has to be
what he is, Joey.

1505
02:09:10,536 --> 02:09:12,196
"Can't break the mold.

1506
02:09:15,082 --> 02:09:17,582
"There's no living
with a killing.

1507
02:09:18,710 --> 02:09:20,630
"There's no going back.

1508
02:09:22,798 --> 02:09:24,678
"Right or wrong,
it's a brand.

1509
02:09:25,551 --> 02:09:27,471
"A brand that sticks.

1510
02:09:30,514 --> 02:09:32,854
"Now you run on home
to your mother.

1511
02:09:34,059 --> 02:09:37,519
"You tell her
everything's all right.

1512
02:09:39,106 --> 02:09:42,436
"There are no more guns
in the valley."

1513
02:09:59,293 --> 02:10:01,303
Let's go.
We gotta move.

1514
02:11:17,204 --> 02:11:20,924
<i>There's a man goin' 'round
takin' names</i>

1515
02:11:21,917 --> 02:11:25,747
<i>And he decides who to free
and who to blame</i>

1516
02:11:27,464 --> 02:11:30,804
<i>Everybody won't be treated
all the same</i>

1517
02:11:32,177 --> 02:11:35,307
<i>There'll be a golden ladder
reaching down</i>

1518
02:11:38,392 --> 02:11:40,942
<i>When the man comes around</i>

1519
02:11:44,690 --> 02:11:48,320
<i>The hairs on your arm
will stand up</i>

1520
02:11:49,611 --> 02:11:53,241
<i>At the terror in each sip
and in each sup</i>

1521
02:11:54,783 --> 02:11:58,123
<i>For you partake
of that last offered cup</i>

1522
02:11:59,663 --> 02:12:03,213
<i>Or disappear
into the potter's ground</i>

1523
02:12:05,711 --> 02:12:07,711
<i>When the man
comes around</i>

1524
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:12,550
<i>Hear the trumpets
hear the pipers</i>

1525
02:12:14,344 --> 02:12:17,474
<i>One hundred million
angels singing</i>

1526
02:12:19,558 --> 02:12:24,228
<i>Multitudes are marching
to the big kettle drum</i>

1527
02:12:25,772 --> 02:12:28,982
<i>Voices callin',
voices cryin'</i>

1528
02:12:30,694 --> 02:12:33,864
<i>Some are born
an' some are dyin'</i>

1529
02:12:35,157 --> 02:12:38,867
<i>It's Alpha's and Omega's
kingdom come</i>

1530
02:12:40,037 --> 02:12:44,247
<i>And the whirlwind
is in the thorn tree</i>

1531
02:12:45,375 --> 02:12:48,625

trimming their wicks</i>

1532

<i>The whirlwind
is in the thorn tree</i>

1533
02:12:55,177 --> 02:12:58,757

to kick against the pricks</i>

1534
02:13:02,351 --> 02:13:06,021
<i>Till Armageddon
no Shalam, no Shalom</i>

1535
02:13:07,397 --> 02:13:10,937
<i>Then the father hen will
call his chickens home</i>

1536
02:13:12,444 --> 02:13:15,614
<i>The wise men will bow down
before the throne</i>

1537
02:13:17,324 --> 02:13:20,744
<i>And at his feet they'll
cast their golden crown</i>

1538
02:13:23,413 --> 02:13:25,793
<i>When the man comes around</i>

1539
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:31,880
<i>Whoever is unjust
let him be unjust still</i>

1540
02:13:32,631 --> 02:13:36,891
<i>Whoever is righteous
let him be righteous still</i>

1541
02:13:37,177 --> 02:13:41,717
<i>Whoever is filthy
let him be filthy still</i>

1542
02:13:42,182 --> 02:13:45,352
<i>Listen to the words
long written down</i>

1543
02:13:47,896 --> 02:13:50,226
<i>When the man comes around</i>

1544
02:13:51,983 --> 02:13:55,283
