00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,316
- I never should...
- Shut up about Skipper!

520
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,317
I mean it! Shut up!

521
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,080
The laws of silence won't work about that!

522
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,111
Not about Skipper and us.

523
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,029
It's like locking the door on a fire
to forget the house is burning.

524
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,473
BRICK: Hey, everybody!

525
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,669
[Thunder rumbles]

526
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,792
MAGGIE: But not looking at a fire
doesn't put it out.

527
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,670
This time I'm going to finish.
That night in the hotel room, Skipper...

528
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,273
I don't want to hear about it!

529
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,114
Why won't you face the truth, just once...

530
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,317
...about Skipper, about me, about yourself?

531
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,389
Hey, everybody!

532
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,511
Are you bringing that party up here or not?

533
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,477
BIG MAMA: Kit and caboodle, son.

534
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,035
That won't do any good.
I'm going to say this...

535
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,038
...and I don't care if it's in front of them.

536
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,597
Do you want to be hit with this crutch?

537
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,671
Are you still blaming me
for Skipper's death?

538
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,352
I could kill you with this crutch.

539
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,710
Good Lord! Do you think I'd care?

540
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,753
Skipper and I had a friendship.
Why won't you let it alone?

541
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,070
- It's got to be told!
- I don't want to hear it!

542
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,511
It's got to be told
and you never let me tell it. I love you...

543
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,359
...and that's worth fighting for.
Not Skipper!

544
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,073
- Skipper was no good!
- Maggie!

545
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,633
Maybe I'm no good.

546
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,989
Nobody's good.

547
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,475
But Skipper is dead!

548
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,592
MAGGIE: And I'm alive!
BRICK: Maggie!

549
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,637
Maggie the cat is alive!

550
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,159
I'm alive!

551
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,271
Why are you afraid of the truth?

552
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,469
Truth?

553
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,595
Little girl, somebody ought to teach you...

554
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,473
...to knock before you open a door.

555
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,037
Otherwise, people might think
you're lacking in good breeding.

556
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,431
Nyah nyah nyah!

557
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,398
DIXIE: What's Uncle Brick doing
on the floor?

558
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,630
I tried to kill your Aunt Maggie...

559
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,114
...but I failed...

560
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,674
...and I fell. Little girl,
would you hand me my crutch, please?

561
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,513
DIXIE: What were you jumping
high hurdles for?

562
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,669
Because I used to, and people like to do
what they used to do...

563
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,954
...after they've stopped being able to do it.

564
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,396
That's right. And that's your answer.

565
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,795
Now go away.

566
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,277
Stop that, you little no-neck monster!

567
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,712
You're just jealous
because you can't have babies.

568
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,714
You see?

569
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,988
Mae and Gooper gloat over us
being childless...

570
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,590
...even in front of their little
no-neck monsters.

571
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,514
I went to a doctor in Memphis.

572
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,950
A gynecologist.

573
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,629
He says there's no reason
why we can't have a child...

574
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,751
...whenever we want.

575
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,275
Brick?

576
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,916
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Maggie, I hear you.

577
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,551
But how in hell do you imagine
you're going to have a child...

578
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,234
...by a man who cannot stand you?

579
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,036
That, boy of mine...

580
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,590
...is a problem I'll just have to work out.

581
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,189
Here comes that party, here we come!

582
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,198
Here comes that birthday party!

583
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,038
That's nice.

584
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,472
DEACON: The preacher almost cried...

585
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,199
...when I told him
I got a stained-glass memorial window.

586
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,872
GOOPER: Who gave you that window?

587
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,111
DEACON: Clyde Fletcher's widow,
a generous woman of fine character.

588
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,839
What someone should give our church
is a cooling system.

589
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,319
Yes, sir. Exactly my thought.

590
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,790
Let's see, they've had the typhoid shots
and the tetanus shots...

591
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,437
...diphtheria shots, hepatitis shots,
polio shots.

592
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,912
MAE: Gooper, what have all the kiddies
been shot for?

593
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,190
Everything but stealing chickens.

594
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,759
[Laughter]

595
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,509
Well, Brick?

596
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,395
Congratulations, Big Daddy,
on your birthday.

597
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,874
Bull!

598
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,269
DEACON: Guess what memorial
Gus's family gave?

599
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,948
- A new house and basketball court...
- Deacon!

600
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,957
What's all this talk about
memorial stained-glass windows?

601
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,913
Figuring on somebody kicking off
around here?

602
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,755
How about some nice music
to start the party off with?

[Classical music plays on radio]

604
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,470
Turn that damn thing off!

605
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,078
Where's my Brick?

606
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,799
- Where's my precious baby?
- Sorry, turn it back on.

607
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,070
BIG MAMA: How does your leg feel, honey?

608
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,630
Your hand was made for holding
something better! Put that liquor down.

609
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,991
GOOPER: He is putting it down, all right!
BIG MAMA: Turn that off!

610
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,753
How about a birthday kiss, honey?

611
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,996
Hey, everybody, you know the first time
Big Daddy kissed me, I fainted.

612
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,077
It's a fact. Ain't that so, honey?

613
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,673
Do you all know how he proposed to me?
I was four months swole with Gooper...

614
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,917
...and Big Daddy said,
'<i>'</i>That's my kid, ain't it? '<i>'</i>

615
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,350
It was kind of funny.
I'd never had a beau...

616
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,159
<i>... till I met your father.</i>
<i>He said, "I want that kid.</i>

617
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,588
<i>"I need him.</i>

618
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,998
'<i>'</i>He ain't going to have nobody else's name
but mine. Let's get the preacher.

BIG DADDY: Ida, will you stop
that yammering?

622
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,832
That's just his manner of talking.
He don't mean it.

623
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,679
I've been his one and only lover,
haven't I, sweetheart?

624
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,951
BIG DADDY: Ida, will you keep quiet?

625

your birthday present.

You open it. I want to talk to Brick.
Brick, come over here.

642

Big Daddy's calling you.

643
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,554
Big Mama, take them out for me.

644
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,389
- It's a cashmere robe!
- You sound surprised.

645
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,752
- I've never seen a cashmere robe before.
- That's funny!

646

What's so funny about it?

647
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,670
All my family ever had was family.

648

Quiet!

649
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,077
- You bought it yourself last Saturday.
- I said quiet!

650
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,353
The salesgirl that sold it to you
waited on me and she told me about it.

651
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,278
- Sister Woman!
- Quiet!

652
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,835
- Stork and the Grim Reaper, neck and neck.
- Deacon!

00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,277
I'm not butting in on more talk about
memorial stained-glass windows, am I?

655
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,239
DEACON: Not at all.

656
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,873
What do you get out
of this charity work, anyway?

657
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,751
I love humanity. That's my reward.

658
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,793
And if humanity returns your love,
you might get elected...

I better go before it starts raining.

some athletics last night.

- I was trying to, yes, sir.
- At 3:00 in the morning?

the high school athletic field at 3:00 AM?

667

Sober, I would not have tried
to jump even the low ones.

670

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,350
- To the biggest cotton planter...
- I told you, quit this bull!

I won't let you talk this way,
not even on your birthday.

on my birthday, or any other rotten day.

they know what they can do about it.

677

here and there and everywhere.

I'm the only boss around here.

684
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,598
<i>I built this place with no help from you.</i>

685
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,638
<i>And I'll run this place till the day I die.</i>

686
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,355
<i>Is that plain to you, Ida?</i>
<i>Is that perfectly clear to you?</i>

687
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,709
<i>I ain't going to die.</i>

688
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,277
Ain't nothing wrong with me
but a spastic colon!

689
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,718
Made spastic, I reckon,
by all the lies and liars...

690
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,229
...l've had to put up with around here.

691
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,877
And all the hypocrisy I've had to live with
these 40 years I've lived with you.

692
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,871
Now blow out them candles.

693
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,798
Go on. Blow out them candles
on that stupid cake.

694
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,111
[Softly] Oh, Big Daddy<i>...</i>

695
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,871
In all these years
you never believed I loved you.

696
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,959
And I did.

697
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,192
I did so much.

698
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,799
I did love you.

699
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,079
I even loved your hate and your hardness.

700
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,552
[Thunder rumbles]

701
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,157
- Big Daddy should make plans.
- Lf he should die before...

702
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,194
DR. BAUGH: Excuse me.

703
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,599
BIG DADDY: Brick!

704
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,508
<i>Son!</i>

705
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,232
BIG DADDY: I was calling Brick.

706
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,794
I was just delivering him to you.

707
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,039
BIG DADDY: What did you do that for?
BRICK: Do what?

708
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,873
Wipe off her kiss?

709
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,115
Did I?

710
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,629
BIG DADDY: Your woman's got
a better shape on her...

711
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,353
...than Gooper's got on his.

712
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,078
- Is that the only difference you've noticed?
- Difference in shape is pretty important.

713
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,953
- But in a way, they're a lot alike.
- How's that?

714
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,038
They don't look peaceful. How's that?

715
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,276
They're a couple of cats...

716
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,593
...sitting in the middle of 28,000 acres
of land. That's a lot of land.

717
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,238
They're both squaring off, determined
to get a bigger piece whenever you let go.

718
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,839
Yeah, well, I've got a surprise
for them babies.

719
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,350
I ain't letting go for a long time yet,
if they're waiting for that.

720
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,115
You just sit tight and let them
scratch each other's eyes out.

721
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,673
You bet your life.

722
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,869
Gooper's wife, she's a good breeder.
You'll have to admit she's fertile.

723
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,469
<i>Five head of them already</i>
<i>and more coming.</i>

724
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,036
<i>6- 0. She'll probably drop a litter next time.</i>

725
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,118
BIG DADDY: Are you stuck out there?
MAE: I was just passing by.

726
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,031
You were just sneaking and spying.

727
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,749
Do I have to lock all the doors around here
to have a private conversation?

728
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,838
- Why hurt those that really love you?
- Bull!

729
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,435
I'm going to move you and Gooper
out of that room.

730
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,036
It's none of your business what goes on
in here between Brick and Maggie.

731
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,800
I hate sneaking and spying!
It makes me puke!

732
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,994
They listen, do they?

733
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,992
Yeah, they listen.

734
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,998
BIG DADDY: They run and tell Big Mama
everything they hear.

735
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,669
They say Maggie sleeps on the bed
and you sleep on the sofa. Is that true?

736
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,550
If you don't like Maggie, get rid of her!
What are you doing now?

737
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,278
BRICK: Freshening up my drink.

738
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,272
BIG DADDY: You've a real liquor problem.
BRICK: Yes, sir.

739
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,999
BIG DADDY: Is that why you quit
sports announcing?

740
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,230
BRICK: I guess so. Yes, sir, that's it.

741
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,317
Don't guess! It's too important!

742
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,432
So you quit.

743
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,953
- Some kind of a disappointment?
- I don't know. Do you?

744
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,713
I'm asking you.
How should I know if you don't?

745
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,319
[Big Daddy coughs]

746
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,430
Do you think a shot of that whisky
would injure my spastic condition?

747
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,828
No, sir.

748
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,831
It might do it some good.

749
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,070
The sky is open again, boy. It's open!

750
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,032
BRICK: That's the way to feel.

751
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,838
I can breathe.

752
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,833
All my life I've been like a doubled-up fist...

753
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,759
...pounding and smashing and driving!

754
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,073
But now I'm going
to take things easy with them.

755
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,279
Do you know what I'm thinking?

756
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,793
What's that, sir?

757
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,195
Pleasure!

758
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,830
I'll tell you, I still have a feeling for women,
and I'm 65.

759
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,395
- That's mighty remarkable.
- Remarkable?

760
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,955
Admirable.

761
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,358
It's not only remarkable and admirable,
it's downright satisfying.

762
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,472
- I'm going to have me a ball.
- A ball?

763
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,398
I'm going to pick me a choice woman...

764
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,189
...and I'm going to smother her in minks
and choke her with diamonds.

765
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,118
I'm going to be happy!

766
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,193
Why are you so restless?
You got ants in your britches?

767
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,759
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

768
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,868
- Something hasn't happened yet.
- What's that?

769
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,469
- A click in my head.
- Did you say, '<i>'</i>click'<i>'</i>?

770
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,354
Yes, sir. That click in my head
that makes me feel peaceful.

771
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,630
Boy, sometimes you worry me.

772
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,511
Like a switch clicking off in my head.
Turns the hot light off and the cool one on.

773
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,397
All of a sudden, there's peace.

774
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,916
You're a real alcoholic!

775
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,554
That is the truth.

776
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,548
Yes, sir, I am an alcoholic.
So, if you'll just excuse me.

777
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,672
BIG DADDY: No, I won't!
BRICK: I'm waiting for that click...

778
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,514
...and I don't get it unless I'm alone!
I'm not talking. When it's quiet!

779
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,639
You'll hear plenty of that in the grave.
Right now we're going to talk.

780
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,150
This talk is like all the others.
It gets nowhere and it's painful!

781
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,432
BIG DADDY: Let it be painful.
BRICK: I can crawl and hop if I have to.

782
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:25,434
If you aren't careful, you'll crawl out
this family and be drinking on skid row.

783
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,112
Yeah, that will come too.

784
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,514
No. Now that I'm straightened out,
I'm going to straighten you out.

785
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,953
Sit down!

786
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,914
It's no use. We talk in circles.
We have nothing to say to each other!

787
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,232
BIG DADDY: Where are you going?
BRICK: To get another bottle.

788
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,749
BIG DADDY: No, you're not,
you drunken whelp!

789
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,274
BIG MAMA: Why are you shouting?
I can't stand it!

790
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,597
BIG DADDY: Get out of here!
Leave us alone! Why do you drink?

791
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,238
BIG DADDY: You had better know
why you drink or give it up!

792
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,068
Give me my crutch.

793
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,076
Why do you drink?

794
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,196
I stepped on that foot and now I'm in pain.

795
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,628
Good!

796
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,512
[Big Daddy moans]

797
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,792
[Sound of breaking glass]

798
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,080
BIG DADDY: [Groans]
At least you're not too numb...

799
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,754
...with liquor to feel pain.

800
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,591
- Why do you drink?
- Give me my crutch.

801
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,837
- Tell me first.
- No, give me a drink first.

802
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,439
Tell me first.

803
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,193
- First you've got to tell me!
- All right! Disgust!

804
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,392
- Disgust with what?
- You strike a hard bargain.

805
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:39,037
- Boy, do you want liquor that bad?
- Yes, sir, I want liquor that bad.

806
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,752
[Phone rings]

807
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,076
What are you disgusted with?

808
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,991
Mendacity! Do you know what that is?
It's lies and liars!

809
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,355
Who's been lying to you? Maggie?

810
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,790
No, not one lie or one person.
The whole thing.

811
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,757
- You got a headache?
- No, I'm trying...

812
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,669
Trying to concentrate, but you can't
because your brain is soaked with liquor.

813
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,949
Wet brain!

814
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,279
BIG DADDY: Mendacity!

815
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,234
<i>What do you know about mendacity?</i>
<i>I could write a book on it.</i>

816
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,149
- It's your sister calling from Memphis.
- To hell with her! Gooper?

817
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,309
Get out of there!

818
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,319
<i>Go on. Close the door after you.</i>

819
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,350
Mendacity!

820
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,436
Look at the lies I've got to put up with.
Pretenses, hypocrisy!

821
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,918
Pretending like I care for Big Mama.
I haven't tolerated her in 40 years.

822
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,195
Church! It bores me, but I go.

823
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,758
All those swindling lodges, social clubs,
and money-grabbing auxiliaries...

824
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,309
...that's got me on their number one
sucker list.

825
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,519
Boy, I've lived with mendacity.
Why can't you live with it?

826
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,396
You've got to. There's nothing to live with
but mendacity. Is there?

827
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,470
Yes, sir, you can live with this.

828
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,349
That's not living.

829
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,792
- That's dodging away from life.
- I want to dodge away from it.

830
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,393
Then why not kill yourself?

831
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,112
BRICK: Because I like to drink.

832
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,753
I can't talk to you!

833
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,075
BRICK: I'm sorry.

834
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,237
Do you expect me to turn over
28,000 acres of the richest land...

835
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,954
...this side of the Nile to a drunk fool?
- No, sir.

836
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,317
I like you, son, but why should I subsidize
worthless behavior?

837
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,272
BRICK: Give it to Gooper and Mae.

838
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,189
BIG DADDY: I can't stand Gooper and Mae
and those five screaming monkeys.

839
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,159
I don't have to turn it over to any of you!

840
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,273
To this day, I ain't made no will.
Now I don't have to, the pressure's off.

841
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,119
I can wait and see
if you pull yourself together or not.

842
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,394
BRICK: That's right.

843
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,310
BIG DADDY: I'm not kidding.
BRICK: No, sir, I know you're not kidding.

844
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,755
You don't care?

845
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,916
No, sir, I don't care.

846
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,712
Tell Lacey to drive me to the station.

847
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,553
BIG DADDY: Now wait a minute!
BRICK: Or I'll drive myself.

848
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,232
I'm going home tonight. Now!

849
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,669
- This is your home.
- Is it? Since when?

850
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,711
Let's not leave it like this.

851
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,428
Like all them other talks we've had.

852
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,916
We always seem to talk around things.

853
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,875
Seem to leave things unsaid and unspoken.

854
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,550
- Now we've got to talk straight.
- It's too late for talk.

855
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,829
Why?

856
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,837
What are you disgusted about?

857
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,999
Because you can't play football anymore?

858
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,557
Because you lost your job?
I'll get it back for you!

859
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,272
[Brick laughs]

860
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,835
What? Sit in a glass box
watching games that I can't play?

861
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,350
Describing what I can't do
while others do it?

862
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,071
Filling my Coke with bourbon so I can
stand it? You'll get that back for me?

863
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,550
I think you're passing the buck.

864
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,159
[Thunder rumbles]

865
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,679
Do you know many drinking men?

866
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,353
I've known a good number.

867
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,630
Could any of them they tell you
why they drank?

868
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,358
You're passing the buck?

869
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,235
You're passing the buck
to things like disgust and mendacity.

870
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,510
If you've got to use that kind of language...

871
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,717
...it's 90 proof bull and I ain't buying any!

872
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,829
You started drinking with your friend
Skipper's death. Ain't that the truth?

873
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,837
[Thunder rumbles]

874
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,834
What are you suggesting?

875
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,835
Nothing. But...

876
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,268
But what?

877
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,429
Say your mind.

878
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,949
BRICK: [Shouts] Say it!

879
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,838
BIG DADDY: Why are you so excited?
BRICK: Go ahead, say it!

880
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,359
Why are you shouting like that?

881
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,396
Skipper and I were friends, understand?

882
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,993
Gooper said that Skipper was...

883
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,913
Skipper is the only thing
that I've got left to believe in!

884
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,592
And you drag it through the gutter!

885
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,194
- Just a minute!
- You make it shameful and filthy!

886
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,988
Give me your hand.

887
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,876
I don't want your hand.
To hell with all lies and liars!

888
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,040
BRICK: Didn't you ever look up to anybody?

889
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,918
<i>Anybody at all in your whole life?</i>

890
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,839
<i>Didn't you ever believe in anything,</i>
<i>anybody?</i>

891
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,873
No, sir, I guess you didn't.

892
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,317
Nothing and nobody
except Big Daddy himself.

893
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,511
You and Skipper played football together.

894
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,160
Made a few touchdowns.
Does that make him God Almighty?

895
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,269
I could depend on him.

896
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,636
BIG DADDY: On the football field!
BRICK: Anytime, anywhere, anyplace!

897
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,836
BIG DADDY: Are you sure of that?
BRICK: Yes.

898
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,109
Bull!

899
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,437
BIG DADDY:
Why did your big strong man fall apart?

900
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,592
<i>Why did Skipper crack up?</i>

901
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,388
All right.

902
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,080
You're asking for it,
we're going to have that talk.

903
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,429
That straight, true talk.

904
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,113
It's too late to stop now.

905
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,753
Can you say it without a drink?

906
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,400
I haven't heard that mechanical click yet.

907
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,593
You need a lot of crutches, don't you?
Clicks. Whisky.

908
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,597
What else do you need?

909
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,357
Skipper?

910
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,189
BIG DADDY: He was a crutch for you too,
wasn't he?

911
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,309
Yes, sir.

912
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,994
I could lean on him, in school and out of it.

913
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,355
How did Maggie take
this great and true friendship?

914
00:54:59,080 --> 00:54:59,910
Ask her.

915
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,030
I'm asking you.

916
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,596
If you want to know why Skipper
cracked up, ask Maggie the cat.

917
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,199
BIG DADDY: What did she do?

918
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,471
Chase him out of the window
of that Chicago hotel?

919
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,110
Did that little bitty girl shove
your big hero out all by herself?

920
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,795
<i>Why?</i>

921
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,950
What went on
between Skipper and Maggie?

922
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,236
Ask her.

Come on, Maggie!

933
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,356

934

Go ahead!

935
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,680
Big Daddy wants to know. Tell him!

936
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,472
MAGGIE: Skipper didn't like me.

937
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,636
BRICK: Why didn't Skipper like you?

938
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,400
- You know he was against our marriage.
- Why?

939
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,195
- Because it meant less freedom for you.
- Freedom to do what?

940
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,794
Freedom to run from town to town.

941
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,150
Planes, trains, always running!

942
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:29,438
- Football practice, dirty stories...
- Nobody forced you to come along with us!

943
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,349
I didn't expect to spend my honeymoon
in the locker room with the boys.

ever injure your sensitive feelings?

945

Football, baby!

946
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,155
The idea of football smelled.

947
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,153
Especially the notions
of a professional team.

948
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,510

<i>He could've gotten a spot</i>

BRICK: You're a liar!

952
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,036
He wasn't good enough on his own.

953
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,470
Professional football is a business...

954
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,669
...not a social club!

955
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,316
You mean the business of making money?

956
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,988
Yeah, money!
The stuff your dreams are made of!

957
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,153

He lapped them up.

961
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,150
The cheers didn't mean anything to me.
But they did to you!

962
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,079
Because they shut you out
and you hated that.

963
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,475
Not by the crowds, baby, by you.

964

00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,875
That's why I hated Skipper.

966
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,115
You hated him so much you got him drunk
and went to bed with him.

967
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,312
Is that true?

00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,912

969

You don't think I ravished a football hero?

00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,152
Skipper was drunk.

971
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,511
So are you most of the time.

972
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,359

[Lncredulously] Are you<i>...</i>

974
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,432
Are you saying nothing happened
between you and Skipper?

975
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,120
MAGGIE: You know what happened.
BRICK: I don't know!

976
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,072
I wasn't there.

977
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,033
I couldn't play that Sunday.
I wasn't in Chicago.

978
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,196
- I was in the hospital...
- Skipper played.

979
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,633
He played all right!

980
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,956
<i>His first professional game without Brick.</i>

981
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,990
Tell Big Daddy what happened.

982
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,633
Go on, tell him.

983
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,671
You're a sports announcer.

984
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,032
Give us a running account
of the all-American bust.

985
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,038
Tell him how many times
Skipper fumbled...

986
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,674
...and stumbled and fell apart.

987
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,879
On offensive he was useless.
On defensive he was a coward.

988
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,433
And it was all over:

989
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,512
Chicago: 47, Dixie Stars: 0.

990
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,278
Bad breaks. An off day.

991
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,429
MAGGIE: No, baby.

992
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,559
Without you, Skipper was nothing.

993
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,790
Outside: Big, tough, confident.

994
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,791
Inside: Pure jelly!

995
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,195
You saw the game on TV.
You saw what happened.

996
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,994
But I didn't see what happened
in Skipper's hotel room.

997
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,911
That little episode was not on TV.

998
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,192
Tell Big Daddy
why you were in Skipper's room.

999
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,719
He was sick.

1000
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,519
Sick with drink.

1001
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,948
He wouldn't come out.

1002
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,359
He'd busted some furniture...

1003
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,069
...and the hotel manager said to stop him
before he called the police.

1004
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,515
So I went to his room.

1005
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,394
I scratched on his door
and begged him to let me in.

1006
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,919
He was half crazy.

1007
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,712
Violent and screaming one minute...

1008
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,115
...weak and crying the next.

1009
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,676
And all the time, scared stiff about you.

1010
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,195
So I said to him maybe it was time
we forgot about football.

1011
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,990
Maybe he ought to get a job
and let me and Brick alone.

1012
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,509
I thought he'd hit me.

1013
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,391
He walked toward me...

1014
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,509
...with a funny sort of smile on his face.

1015
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,349
Then he did the strangest thing.

1016
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,438
He kissed me.

1017

That was the first time
he'd ever touched me.

1019

I'd get rid of Skipper.

1020
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,915

true friendship was a big lie.

1022

1023

He didn't need any coaxing.

1024
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,917
He was more than willing.

1025
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,350
He even seemed to have the same idea.

1026

You're just trying to whitewash it.

It didn't matter how.
I would've done anything.

1031
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,272
But at the last second...

1032
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,112

Supposing you'd hate me
instead of Skipper?

1035
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,112
So I ran.

When they put his broken body
in the ambulance.

1053

I rode with him to the hospital.

01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,431
GOOPER: It's time we had that talk, Doc.

1188
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,598
- It'll be painful.
- Painful things can't always be avoided.

1189
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,990
So I've noticed. But there are times...

1190
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,952
It's time we all had our talk.

1191
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,355
What talk are you talking about?

1192
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,996
GOOPER: What were they fighting about?
DR. BAUGH: We didn't discuss it.

1193
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,310
MAE: What's he doing in the cellar
all alone?

1194
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,879
Why can't Big Mama see him?

1195
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,195
You heard why.

1196
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,551
He's got the stomach upset.
It's made him irritable.

1197
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,310
When couples have been together
as long as me and Big Daddy...

1198
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,115
...they get irritable with each other
from too much devotion.

1199
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,798
Isn't that so?

1200
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,996
Of course that's so.

1201
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,472
He loves his family.

1202
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,234
He loves them around,
but it strains his nerves.

1203
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,079
He wasn't himself.
I could tell he was all worked-up.

1204
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,720
MAGGIE: It's the party and the excitement.

1205
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,388
He's probably just a little worn out,
that's all.

1206
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,919
Did you notice how he ate?

1207
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,195
He ate like a P-l-G hog.

1208
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,671
GOOPER: I hope he doesn't regret it.

1209
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,109
Who?

1210
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,879
Big Daddy?

1211
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,436
He helped himself twice to hopping John.

1212
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,230
He just loves hopping John.
We had a real country dinner.

1213
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,873
BIG MAMA: And candied yams.

1214
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,272
That man put away
enough to stuff a field hand.

1215
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,030
I hope he doesn't have
to pay for it later on.

1216
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,355
What's that?

1217
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,788
Gooper say he hopes...

1218
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,195
Shoot! Gooper says!

1219
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,960
There ain't nothing wrong
with Big Daddy but nerves.

1220
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,076
Ain't that so?

1221
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,828
He's as sound as a dollar.
And now he knows he is.

1222
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,158
That's why he ate such a supper.
He had a load off his mind, knowing he...

1223
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,920
...he wasn't doomed to...

1224
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,915
...what he thought he was doomed to.

1225
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,316
Nothing's going to hurt Big Daddy.

1226
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,630
We won't allow anything to happen to him.

1227
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,230
Doc, come here!

1228
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,673
I don't need any doctor.

1229
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,557
He's something to say about Big Daddy.

1230
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,119
I want Brick.

1231
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,751
He'll be down directly.

1232
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,235
BIG MAMA: Sticky rain
always makes me sick.

1233
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,800
Give me something
to wash this tablet down with.

1234
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,998
BIG MAMA: What's wrong?
You've all got such long faces.

1235
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,994
Big Mama needs you.

1236
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,758
They'll tell her without me.

1237
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,359
Please, Brick.

1238
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,154
I just can't stand the way
that Mae and Gooper are...

1239
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,754
What? Trying to grab this place
for themselves?

1240
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,996
Let them have it all.

1241
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,509
If you want to fight for a piece
of his carcass...

1242
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,830
...you go ahead,
but you'll do it without me.

1243
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,038
I deserved that. But not this time.
This time you're wrong.

1244
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,593
What I can't stand is<i>...</i>

1245
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,717
It's not losing this place, it's Big Mama.

1246
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,359
I know what it's like
to lose somebody you love.

1247
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,154
Careful, your claws are showing.

1248
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,594
Close that door.

1249
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,392
Don't close that door.

1250
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,912
Let a little air circulate.

1251
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,114
We shouldn't risk Big Daddy
hearing this discussion.

1252
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,033
What discussion of what?

1253
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,714
BIG MAMA: Maggie, Brick!
GOOPER: Now, now, Big Mama...

1254
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,360
There won't be a word said
in Big Daddy's house...

1255
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,398
...that he can't hear if he wants to.
Brick, where are you?

1256
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,755
Where do you think?
Gone to pieces, that's where!

1257
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,190
MAE: Doc, ain't there a cure for drinkers?

1258
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,356
- He don't need no cure.
- Of course not.

1259
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,113
GOOPER: He'll just drink
all the whisky in the state.

1260
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,236
BIG MAMA: Stop that kind of talk!

1261
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,909
Big Daddy takes a drink now and then.
I don't trust a man who don't drink.

1262
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,553
Good for you!

1263
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,794
Sit down and hold Big Mama's hand
while we talk.

1264
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,190
BIG MAMA: What are you all
surrounding me for?

1265
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,197
I don't need anyone to hold my hand.

1266
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,310
Are you all crazy?

1267
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,631
- You calm yourself, sweetheart.
- You calm yourself, Sister Woman!

1268
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,114
How can I calm myself...

1269
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,078
<i>... with everyone staring at me</i>
<i>as if blood was on my face?</i>

1270
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,831
What's all this about?

1271
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,035
Sit down, Mae.

1272
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,993
Big Mama wants to know the truth
about the clinic report.

1273
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,519
Truth!

1274
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,960
Everybody keeps hollering about the truth.

1275
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,559
The truth is as dirty...

1276
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,829
...as lies!

1277
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,791
Is there something I don't know, Doc?

1278
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,279
DR. BAUGH: Well, Ida<i>...</i>

1279
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,634
I want to know!

1280
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,118
- Somebody must be lying.
- Sit down, Mama, please.

1281
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,478
I want to know about my husband.

1282
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:09,235
He had the most thorough examination
at the Oppenheim Clinic.

1283
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,396
One of the best clinics in the country.

1284
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,948
The best in the country, bar none.

1285
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,680
They were 99.9 percent sure
before they even started.

1286
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,114
Right, Doc?

1287
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,229
Sure of what?

1288
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,476
MAGGIE: Not now!
MAE: The test was positive!

1289
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,595
Mae, shut up.

1290
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,272
It's hopeless. He knows it, too.

1291
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,229
Hopeless?

1292
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,000
MAE: Now, now, darling.
GOOPER: You had to know.

1293
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,879
Why didn't they cut it out of him?

1294
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,197
DR. BAUGH: It's gone past the knife.
MAE: He's dying, Big Mama.

1295
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,470
You get away from me, Mae!

1296
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,476
I want Brick.

1297
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,551
<i>Where's my Brick? Where's my only son?</i>

1298
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,229
Brick!

1299
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,634
Mama, please.

1300
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,709
[Big Mama sobs]

1301
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,513
GOOPER: I'm your son, too.
MAE: Gooper's your firstborn.

1302
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,636
GOOPER: Now, listen to me!
BIG MAMA: No!

1303
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,917
- He'll be in pain.
- Gooper and I think...

1304
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,473
GOOPER: Mae, shut up!

1305
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,352
- Do you want to see him suffer?
- No.

1306
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,829
Then he's got to be started on morphine.

1307
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,560
Nobody's going to give
my husband morphine.

1308
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,319
[Gasps repeatedly] No.

1309
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,154
Why don't you give her a while
to adjust to the idea?

1310
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,992
It's Maggie who's upsetting her.

1311
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:27,073
GOOPER: Instead of the needle, haven't
you got a pill to make the pain disappear?

1312
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,676
Sometimes I wish I had a pill
to make people disappear.

1313
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,031
GOOPER: Thanks for everything, Doc.
We sure do appreciate<i>...</i>

1314
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,314
[Thunder rumbles]

1315
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,756
Does Brick know?

1316
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,191
You know, honey...

1317
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,389
...we was never a very happy family.

1318
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,115
There wasn't much joy in this house.

1319
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:18,437
It wasn't Big Daddy's fault. It was just<i>...</i>

1320
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,310
You know how some homes are happy.

1321
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,877
I thought, coming home from the clinic
today, '<i>'</i>Now we'll be happy here.'<i>'</i>

1322
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,631
You and Brick will live with us
and have your children here.

1323
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,956
And we'll help each other be happy.

1324
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,951
Nothing's ever the way you plan, is it?

1325
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,874
Margaret, honey...

1326
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,354
...you've got to help Brick.

1327
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,032
Make him pull himself together.

1328
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,834
BIG MAMA: He'll take hold of things.
MAE: What things?

1329
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,276
The place.

1330
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,398
Big Mama, you've had a shock.

1331
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,828
We've all had a shock.

1332
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,753
- Let's be realistic.
- Big Daddy wouldn't be foolish enough...

1333
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,957
He'd never put this place
in irresponsible hands!

1334
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,349
He ain't putting this place
in anybody's hands.

1335
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,035
My husband is not going to die!

1336
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,549
I want you to get that in your heads.
Both of you.

1337
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,995
- We're hoping too.
- We intend to pray for him.

1338
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,191
I won't let you persuade Big Daddy to...

1339
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,191
Gooper is your firstborn!

1340
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,949
He's always had to carry a bigger load
of the responsibilities than Brick.

1341
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,669
<i>Brick never carried a thing in his life</i>
<i>but a football or a highball.</i>

1342
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,598
GOOPER: Will you let me talk, please?

1343
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,079
Yes, of course.

1344
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,273
A 28,000 acre plantation
is a mighty big thing to run.

1345
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,833
Almost single-handed.

1346
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,430
You had your law practice in Memphis.
When did you run this place?

1347
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,034
Mama, let's be fair.

1348
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,950
Ever since Big Daddy's health
started failing...

1349
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,429
...Gooper's worked like a fool
to keep this place up.

1350
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,316
Mae<i>...</i>

1351
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,834
Gooper won't admit it.
He never thought of it as a duty.

1352

1521
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,597
...with the men who run it for you.
You don't know their names...

1522
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:11,270
...or if they've kids or are happy.
You've never looked into their faces.

1523
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,830
What are faces? You don't build an empire
by remembering faces.

1524
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,958
<i>Next week,</i>
<i>I'll start building that textile plant.</i>

1525
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:21,948
I'll not only grow my own cotton,
I'll weave it and market it.

1526
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:22,836
I'll tell you...

1527
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,349
<i>... in a year or two from now</i>...

1528
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:44,513
The men who build empires die,
and empires die too.

1529

No, it won't.

1530
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,511
That's why I've got you and Gooper.

1531
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,914
Look at Gooper.

1532
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,351
Look at what he's become.
Is that what you wanted him to be?

1533
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:54,993
Look at me.

1534
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:59,359
You were right. I am a 30-year-old kid.
And pretty soon I'll be a 50-year-old kid.

1535
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:02,757
I don't know what to believe in.
What's the good of living?

1536
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,350
There's got to be some purpose in life,
some meaning.

1537
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,430
Look at me, for the sake of God,
before it's too late!

1538
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:13,353
For once, look at me as I really am.

1539
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,788
Look at me!

1540
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,713
I'm a failure. I'm a drunk.

1541
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,310
On my own in the open market,
I'm not worth the price of a decent burial.

1542
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,877
- All of you blame me for everything, huh?
- No, Papa.

1543
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:32,152
We've known each other all my life
and we're strangers.

You own 28,000 acres.
You own $10 million.

1545

You own a wife and two children.
You own us, but you don't love us.

1546

- In my own way...
- No, sir.

1547
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,351
You don't even like people.

1548
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:51,477
You wanted Gooper and me to have kids.
Why?

1549
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:56,479
I want a part of me to keep living.
I won't have it end with the grave.

Look!

1551
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,874
This is what my father left me.

1552

This lousy old suitcase!

1553
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,395
On the inside was nothing...

1554
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,149
...but his uniform
from the Spanish-American War.

1555
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,590
This was his legacy to me.

1556
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,392
Nothing at all!

1557
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,198
And I built this place from nothing.

[Slow instrumental music]

1559
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,110
And that's all he left you?

1560
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,914
Yeah, he was a hobo.

1561
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:32,233
Best-known tramp on the boxcar circuit.

1562
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:35,830
He worked once in a while as a field hand.
I'd tag along.

1563
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:39,716
Sat on my bare bottom, in the dirt,
waiting for him.

1564
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,832
Outside of hunger...

1565
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,395
...first thing I could remember is shame.

1566
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,319
I was ashamed
of that miserable, old tramp.

<i>And you'll never have to bury me</i>
<i>like I did him.</i>

1569
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,191
I buried him in a meadow,
alongside a railroad track.

1570
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,636
We were running to catch a freight
and his heart gave out.

1571

You know something?

1572
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,356
That lousy old tramp died laughing.

BRICK: Laughing at what?

1574
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,917
Himself, I guess.

1575
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,519
A hobo tramp...

1576
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,429
...not a nickel in his jeans.
No future, no past.

1577
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:26,595
Or maybe he was laughing
because he was happy.

1578
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,311
Happy at having you with him.

1579
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:32,199
He took you everywhere
and he kept you with him.

1580
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,837
I don't want to talk about that.

1581
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,318
Yeah, I loved him.

1582
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,998

as much as that...

1684
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,192
What kind of an announcement?

1685
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:46,716
An announcement of life beginning.

1686
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:50,991
A child is coming...

1687
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,474
...sired by Brick out of Maggie the cat.

1688
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:00,475
I have Brick's child in my body.

1689
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:03,276
And that is my present to you.

1690
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:07,349
Did you ever in your born days
hear such a bald-faced lie?

1691
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:08,675
Shut up.

1692
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,759
Thank you.

1693
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:13,678
Thank you very much.

1694
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:30,229
Yes, indeed, this girl has life in her body.

1695
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:32,832
And that's no lie.

1696
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:37,036
I want my lawyer in the morning.
My lawyer!

1697
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,636
- Brick?
- Yes, Big Daddy?

1698
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:46,192
I'm going out to look this place over
before I give it up.

1699
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:48,716
The place and the people on it.

1700
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,234
Ida?

1701
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,119
You want to come with me?

1702
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,239
GOOPER: Brick<i>...</i>

1703
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,596
What were you two talking about
down there?

1704
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:12,556
Us.

1705
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,075
Me, too?

1706
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:15,557
Yeah.

1707
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,399
You ripped your own brother apart.

1708
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:21,272
Do you believe that, Gooper?

1709
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,679
- No.
- Well, I do!

1710
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:27,790
Keep still.

1711
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,118
A family crisis brings out the best
and the worst in every member.

1712
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:33,839
That's the truth.

1713
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,229
Amen.

1714
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:39,397
MAE: You want to talk about the truth?
You're not pregnant.

1715
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:41,039
- Be still, Mae.
- She made it up.

1716
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:44,237
- I said shut up.
- Don't you try to kid us.

1717
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,398
She's not kidding you.

1718
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:50,876
How can she have a child by you,
when you won't even...

1719
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:52,155
GOOPER: Keep quiet!

1720
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:55,755
MAE: We occupy the next room
and the walls aren't soundproof.

1721
01:41:55,960 --> 01:42:00,272
We hear the nightly pleading
and the nightly refusals!

1722
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,438
Not everybody makes as much noise
about love as you do.

1723
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:10,117
I never thought you would stoop
to her level!

1724
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:13,795
BRICK: You heard what Big Daddy said,
'<i>'</i>That girl's got life in her body.'<i>'</i>

1725
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,518
- That's a lie!
- No.

1726
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,388
No, truth is something desperate,
and Maggie's got it.

1727
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:22,790
<i>Believe me, it is desperate,</i>
<i>and she has got it.</i>

1728
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,198
MAE: Why don't you
say something, honey?

1729
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,233
All right, honey.

1730
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:30,475
Shut up!

1731
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,354
Maggie?

1732
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:35,715
Yes?

1733
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,472
BRICK: Come on up here.

1734
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:39,755
Yes, sir!

1735
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,236
That girl's got life in her, all right.

1736
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:53,631
[Soft instrumental music]

1737
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,760
Thank you for keeping still.

1738
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:59,196
For backing me up in my lie.

1739
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:00,629
Maggie<i>...</i>

1740
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:04,835
We are through with lies
and liars in this house.

1741
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:07,754
Lock the door.

1742
