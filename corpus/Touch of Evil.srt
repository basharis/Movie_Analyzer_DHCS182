1
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,434
You folks are American citizens?

2
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:27,028
I am, yes.
- Where were you born, Miss? - Mrs!

3
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,865
What? - Philadelphia.
- The name is Vargas.

4
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,581
Hey, Jim! See who's here?

5
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,892
Sure, Mr Vargas!
Hot on the trail of another dope ring?

6
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:40,456
Hot on the trail of a chocolate soda
for my wife. - Your wife?

7
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,669
Barely a bride, officer.

8
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,547
Can I get through?

9
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:49,046
So you cracked that Grandi business.
- We hear you caught the big boss!

10
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,840
Only one of them.
The Grandis are a big family.

11
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,757
No purchases, Mr Linnekar?
- Hey, I got this...

12
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,685
American citizen, Miss?
- I got this ticking noise...

13
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:04,103
No, really.
This ticking noise in my head!

14
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:11,523
Mike, this is the very first time
we've been together in my country!

15
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,197
And I haven't kissed you
in over an hour.

16
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:30,800
Mike, what happened?
- That car that passed us exploded!

17
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,052
How could it do that?
- I'll have to try to find out.

18
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:40,634
Better not come any closer.
We'll have to postpone that soda.

19
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,186
Mike, couldn't I...
- Susie, please be careful!

20
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,363
This could be very bad for us.
- For us?

21
00:04:56,586 --> 00:05:01,115
For Mexico. Anyway, there's nothing
I can do over here. - So?

22
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:05,123
So I'll try not to be too long.
Go on, darling.

23
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:07,621
Wait at the hotel.

24
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:16,799
Blaine! I thought you were
in Washington. - I leave tomorrow.

25
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:20,224
You know Schwartz,
of the local D.A.'s office.

26
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:23,597
Who's in charge here?
- I can't even tell you what happened.

27
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:26,106
Why aren't you in Mexico City
for that dope trial?

28
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,140
Grandi? I hoped to go
on the morning plane, but now...

29
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:32,146
This business?
- Afraid so.

30
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:38,360
That bomb came from the Mexican side
of the border. - The car did.

31
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:01,933
He says
you don't understand what he wants.

32
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:05,386
I understand very well.
- He saved your life, lady.

33
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:07,851
Tell him I'm a married woman,

34
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:11,439
and that my husband
is a government official,

35
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:15,275
ready and willing
to knock out all his front teeth.

36
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:19,196
That's it, your husband.
- That's what he wants to talk about.

37
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:29,827
"Follow this boy at once. We have
something important for Mr Vargas."

38
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:32,708
Well, what have I got to lose?

39
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,589
Don't answer that?

40
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,667
Lead on, Poncho!

41
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:40,840
Across the border again?

42
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:48,558
Hey Doc, here comes the D. A!

43
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:54,686
Where's Captain Quinlan?
- He's on his way.

44
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,736
Old Hank must be the only one
who didn't hear the explosion.

45
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:04,281
Terrible thing.
Has the daughter been told?

46
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:08,487
They're bringing her over now,
to identify her father's body.

47
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:15,878
An hour ago, Rudy Linnekar
had this town in his pocket.

48
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:18,337
Now you could
strain him through a sieve.

49
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,972
I guess that's my father.

50
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:32,010
Now Miss Linnekar,
can you identify the woman?

51
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,393
I'm not acquainted with my father's
girlfriends. - OK, Miss Linnekar.

52
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:42,105
Here comes Hank at last!

53
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:46,695
You've heard of Hank Quinlan, police
celebrity? - I'd like to meet him.

54
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,277
That's what you think!

55
00:07:55,928 --> 00:08:00,624
Did they toss it in,
or was it planted ahead of time?

56
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:05,425
Who?
- Whoever did it, you jackass!

57
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:17,850
Hey lady, look at the pretty baby!

58
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:37,535
My nephew says
you called him "Poncho". Why?

59
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:42,208
Why you call him "Poncho"?
- Just for laughs.

60
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:46,712
This note says
you have something for my husband.

61
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:51,881
Se単or Vargas, eh?
You know who I am?

62
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:55,095
Want me to guess?
- My name is Grandi.

63
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:59,267
You've heard the name before?

64
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,557
Aside from my husband's case,
isn't there a nightclub by that name?

65
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:08,529
Yeah. "Grandi's Rancho Grande".

66
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:09,992
My gun.

67
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,160
Kind of a joke.

68
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:17,867
Get it? - I can't say
it's the funniest thing I ever heard.

69
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:22,159
The name ain't Mexican.
I got a permit for this thing.

70
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:27,463
The Grandis been in Los Robles a long
time. Some in Mexico, some here.

71
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:31,964
Must be convenient for business.
- Yeah?

72
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:35,009
What business?
- Grandi business.

73
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,721
Yeah?
- Yeah!

74
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:42,438
You know what's wrong with you?
You've seen too many gangster movies.

75
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:46,985
Mike may spoil some of your fun.
- Mike? - My husband, yeah!

76
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:52,694
If you're trying to get me to call
him off, let me tell you something.

77
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:54,991
I may be scared, but he won't be.

78
00:09:55,211 --> 00:10:00,203
You figure it was a bomb then, Hank?
- Or he was struck by lightning.

79
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:04,373
Where's the daughter?
- Marcia? She's waiting for you.

80
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:08,544
Let her go.
- You don't even want to question her?

81
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:11,291
Let her go, and put a tail on her.

82
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:15,840
Let's see if some Jane knew Linnekar.
- There was some strip-teaser.

83
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:20,309
What do you know? The D.A.,
in a monkey suit! - Well, it's...

84
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:23,763
You too! - We were all at the banquet.
- Political rally.

85
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:28,566
No, "Tootsie's Steakhouse".
- G-men, T-men...

86
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:34,146
Quite a little tea party,
all for Rudy Linnekar's bonfire.

87
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:39,402
I hear he even invited some Mexican.
- Vargas doesn't claim jurisdiction.

88
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:46,579
I hope not. 2 Americans are dynamited,
practically in my own police station.

89
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:49,625
What makes you sure it was dynamite?

90
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,837
My leg. - What?
- His game leg!

91
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:56,710
Sometimes he gets a twinge, like
some folks for a change of weather.

92
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:58,762
Intuition, he calls it.

93
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:03,048
Vargas thinks the murder took place
outside our jurisdiction.

94
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:06,597
Of course we're all
going to cooperate. - Don't worry,

95
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:09,727
I'm merely what the United Nations
would call an observer.

96
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,978
Well, you don't talk like one.
Like a Mexican, I mean.

97
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,612
You won't have any trouble with me.

98
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,820
You bet your sweet life I won't.

99
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,456
Mike must be looking for me now,
and that's bound to mean trouble.

100
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:29,952
What's so funny about that?

101
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:35,173
He wants to know
if your husband is jealous, Se単ora.

102
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:37,798
You silly little pig!

103
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:43,306
Who are you talking about?
- About you! You ridiculous,

104
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:46,429
old-fashioned, lopsided little Caesar!

105
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:50,056
I didn't get that, Se単ora,
you'll have to talk slow.

106
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:53,648
I'm talking slow,
but in a minute I'll start to yell.

107
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:57,065
I wouldn't do that, Se単ora.

108
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:05,073
Just a little while ago,
this was a quiet, peaceful town!

109
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:08,248
And now this Vargas comes along...
- Mr Grandi...

110
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,083
You have something for my husband.
Isn't it time you gave it to me?

111
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:18,711
It's time he laid off my brother
in Mexico City! That's advice.

112
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:22,005
That's what I got for him.

113
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:29,966
Then the conference is over?

114
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:33,773
I'm free to leave?
- Free?

115
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:37,642
Nobody was holding you,
Mrs Vargas.

116
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,311
Nobody laid a hand on you.

117
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:44,949
You were just
paying us a little visit.

118
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,999
Goodbye, all.

119
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:09,844
Quinlan, we just can't cross over
into Mexico like this.

120
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:14,561
Thousands do every day. - Tourists...
- So, we're tourists.

121
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:18,681
Quinlan wants to check on
that girl with Linnekar in the car.

122
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,565
She was one of the strip-teasers,
I think I told you.

123
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:25,522
Pete told me before I left the ranch.
- That's right.

124
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,568
I told him I wanted to see
all the strip-teasers in the joint.

125
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:32,569
This is Mexican territory.
What can we do?

126
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,993
There's no law against visitors
asking questions, is there, Mr Vargas?

127
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:39,499
Where'd he go?

128
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:44,630
Susie, where were you?
- Mike, darling! - What happened?

129
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:48,716
Just wait till I tell you.
The craziest thing...

130
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:53,136
Who's the Jane? - His wife.
- What do you know?

131
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,229
She don't look Mexican, either.

132
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:25,424
The key to this whole thing
is the dynamite.

133
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:29,969
The killer didn't just want Linnekar
dead, but destroyed. Annihilated.

134
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:33,507
Over here, Vargas.
We're going in the back way.

135
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:39,143
Se単or Vargas!

136
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:40,606
Se単or Vargas!

137
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:45,985
Yes?

138
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,875
Anything wrong, Vargas?

139
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,218
No, I just couldn't catch him.

140
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,798
I hardly knew him.

141
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:23,011
Adair, come on. - Yes...
And I'm not finished with you yet.

142
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:26,109
Show's over. I'm going home.
- No, Ma'am.

143
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:30,226
We're gonna find out
nobody even knew the murdered girl.

144
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:34,403
Let's talk to this young lady.
- Cita? I didn't know her.

145
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:37,910
She joined the show a few days ago.

146
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:43,204
Wasting our time around here.
- I wouldn't say that. Good night.

147
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:51,086
What happened to Menzies and Vargas?
- They'll show up.

148
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,880
Pianola...
- Hey, we go this way!

149
00:15:57,106 --> 00:16:00,390
Tanya still open for business?

150
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:42,342
I don't know what Quinlan
thinks she's got to do with it.

151
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:48,353
Maybe she'll cook chili for him,
or bring out the crystal ball.

152
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,620
We're closed.

153
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:22,800
You've been cooking at this hour?
- Just cleaning up.

154
00:17:24,316 --> 00:17:26,888
Have you forgotten your old friend?

155
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:31,939
I told you we're closed.
- I'm Hank Quinlan.

156
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,892
I didn't recognize you.

157
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,071
You should lay off those candy bars.

158
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,823
It's either the candy or the hooch.

159
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:48,703
I wish it was your chili
I was gettin' fat on.

160
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:51,281
Anyway, you're sure lookin' good.

161
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:56,079
You're a mess, honey.
- Yeah...

162
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:00,254
That pianola brings back memories.

163
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,423
The customers go for it.
It's so old, it's new.

164
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:08,255
We got the television, too.

165
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:15,435
We run movies. What can I offer you?

166
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:18,349
You haven't heard anything
about that bomb, have you?

167
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:25,899
That was on your side of the border.
- You hear things at these places.

168
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:29,871
I heard the explosion.

169
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:38,538
When this case is over, I'll come
and sample some of your chili.

170
00:18:38,763 --> 00:18:41,537
Be careful.
It may be too hot for you.

171
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:49,138
Hank! Looks like our friend Vargas
ran into some trouble. - Where?

172
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:52,807
In the alley behind the nightclub.
- Yeah?

173
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,564
Well, what happened to Vargas?

174
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:01,893
Nothing.
- Oh no? - Al!

175
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,855
It had nothing to do with the bombing.
- Somebody threw acid at him.

176
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:09,567
It doesn't matter. He missed.
- Who was it, Al?

177
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:13,861
I don't know. He got away.
- It was one of the Grandi kids.

178
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:17,824
What makes you so sure of that?
- Intuition.

179
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:23,662
Intuition? - Vargas and his
Keystone Cops have been giving

180
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:26,297
the Grandi family
quite a tough time lately.

181
00:19:26,518 --> 00:19:29,838
Does your intuition
also tell you about my wife?

182
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:35,139
She was accosted and led to some dive
on your side of the border.

183
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:42,564
The Vargas family seems to be
gettin' into a lot of trouble tonight.

184
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:46,104
Can you describe this man?
- The first one...

185
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,531
...was young, good-looking...
- So there were two men?

186
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:50,992
Not exactly.

187
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,282
You say she was taken by force?

188
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:59,332
Not by force, no.
One of the Grandis was there waiting.

189
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,534
Short, fat, with a moustache...
- Uncle Joe. - What?

190
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:06,798
They call him Uncle Joe Grandi.
- That's right.

191
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
Go on.

192
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,923
I've told you what happened.
Aren't you gonna do something?

193
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:18,216
You have to make a charge.
Isn't that procedure in Mexico?

194
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:21,515
You say your wife was attacked.
- I didn't say that.

195
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:25,308
Molested? - Not physically, no.
- Was obscene language used?

196
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:30,859
I don't think so. - So your wife
allowed herself to be picked up...

197
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:34,151
She was not picked up.
- I think we're on the wrong tack.

198
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:37,493
Then this young man was her friend?
- Obviously not!

199
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:42,124
You wouldn't call that getting
picked up? - Now we mustn't forget

200
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:46,041
that Mr Vargas
is not on the witness stand.

201
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:50,792
Hank's a born lawyer, you know.
- No, lawyers only care about the law.

202
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:54,171
Captain, you are a policeman?

203
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:57,550
Aren't you?
You don't seem very fond of the job.

204
00:20:57,774 --> 00:20:59,718
Plenty of soldiers don't like war.

205
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:04,053
It's a dirty job, enforcing the law.
But it's what we're supposed to do.

206
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:09,024
When a murderer's loose,
I'm supposed to catch him.

207
00:21:11,663 --> 00:21:16,441
Well, Pete,
let's get back to civilization.

208
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:29,627
Let's go, Hank. It's almost dawn.
You gotta get some rest.

209
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:35,172
No chance of that, partner.
We got a big day ahead of us.

210
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:23,548
See any better this way?

211
00:22:29,697 --> 00:22:33,397
You can turn it off now, buster,
you're wasting your batteries.

212
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:46,870
What are you doing in the dark?

213
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:49,782
There's no shade on the window.

214
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:53,790
Can we turn the light on now?

215
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:56,419
No, we can't.
- Why not?

216
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,509
'Cause there's no bulb any more.

217
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:10,473
Risto! Risto!

218
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:13,434
Uncle Joe is plenty mad.
He wants to talk to you!

219
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:18,101
Risto! Risto, come back here!

220
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:24,192
Stop him!

221
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:26,241
Stop him, Sam!

222
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,120
Who told you to throw acid at Vargas?

223
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,247
Stop him!

224
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:38,373
Who told you to throw acid at Vargas?

225
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:43,045
Who's the boss of this family?
Who's the boss?

226
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:47,253
My old man.
- Sure, but he's in the pen!

227
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:50,682
Until he gets out,
who's running this outfit?

228
00:23:50,902 --> 00:23:54,138
Who's in charge?
- Alright, you.

229
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:59,940
What a setup to work with!
One brother in jail, two others dead.

230
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,859
Nobody left to do business with
but a bunch of nephews!

231
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,525
Don't do that!

232
00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:09,152
You lost your rug, Uncle Joe.
You lost your rug!

233
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,573
This isn't the real Mexico,
you know that.

234
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,331
Border towns bring out
the worst in a country.

235
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:19,622
Imagine your mother's face
if she saw our honeymoon hotel!

236
00:24:19,846 --> 00:24:21,089
Se単or Vargas!

237
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:24,957
Does this mean you're taking
the early plane back to Mexico City?

238
00:24:26,144 --> 00:24:29,262
It doesn't leave for another 2 hours.

239
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:34,764
All I can say is, if you are taking
that plane, I'm very glad.

240
00:24:34,986 --> 00:24:38,270
I'm very glad you're very glad.

241
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:48,697
Who told you to start this funny stuff
with the acid? Who told you?

242
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:52,070
I just wanted to give his wife
something to think about.

243
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:55,910
She's gonna get plenty, don't worry.
- Here, you lost your rug. - What?

244
00:24:56,132 --> 00:24:57,956
You lost your rug.

245
00:24:58,175 --> 00:25:01,744
My old man's in no shape for the pen.
If they give him ten, he dies.

246
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:05,961
And if Vargas gets hurt, what happens?

247
00:25:06,183 --> 00:25:10,428
My brother Vic's as good as convicted.
You leave Vargas to me.

248
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:12,886
Uncle Joe!
- What?

249
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:26,232
Sam, take it to her.

250
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,907
I don't want any more postcards.

251
00:25:43,678 --> 00:25:48,789
I don't speak any Spanish. What do
you want? - I was to give this to you.

252
00:26:03,447 --> 00:26:05,774
Susan ... - Mike, look at...
- That was the police.

253
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:10,313
Quinlan has a lead. I must meet him.
Tell me what you want to do.

254
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:15,814
If you're going to Mexico City,
I can take you to the airport.

255
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:20,323
Perhaps that would be best. Just for
a few days. - I don't think so.

256
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:23,208
But a minute ago ... - A minute ago
I said a lot of things.

257
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:27,961
Now I think the best thing
is to stick close to my husband. OK?

258
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:41,757
I'm coming with you. - But I must see
Quinlan at the U.S. Police station.

259
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:44,260
I'll wait at the motel.
- What motel?

260
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:47,641
There must be one
on the American side of the border.

261
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:49,559
"The American side of the border."

262
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:53,435
I'll be safe there.
You won't have to worry about me.

263
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,734
Did I say the wrong thing again?

264
00:26:56,958 --> 00:27:00,776
No, but it would be nice
for a man in my place

265
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:03,581
to be able to look after
his own wife in his own country.

266
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:08,869
If I go to the American motel,
it's just for comfort.

267
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,453
Not for safety.

268
00:27:12,223 --> 00:27:14,831
Whatever you say, my dear.

269
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:20,924
...wealthy contractor
Rudolph Linnekar

270
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:24,681
has been identified
with a blonde nightclub dancer

271
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:30,772
killed in an explosion
a few yards this side of the border.

272
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:36,232
We'll get him where it really hurts.
Without laying a hand on him.

273
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:45,402
He's got a reputation!
He's got a young bride!

274
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:50,907
He's gonna leave this town
wishing they'd never been born!

275
00:28:00,604 --> 00:28:04,966
But don't you see, darling,
if the bomb was planted in Mexico,

276
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:10,183
and the accused is Mexican, what an
international scandal this could be?

277
00:28:10,404 --> 00:28:13,641
It might be kind of rough
on the tourist trade.

278
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:20,353
One of the longest borders on earth
is right here between our countries.

279
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:27,448
An open border, 1400 miles
without a single machine gun.

280
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:31,703
I suppose it all sounds
very corny to you.

281
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:35,871
I could love being corny,
if my husband would only cooperate.

282
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:11,402
Vargas? - Hello Schwartz. - Quinlan's
onto something new. Coming?

283
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:17,122
I have to drop my wife at a motel.
- Hank wants you with him. I'll do it.

284
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:20,036
No trouble at all, Ma'am.
- Won't you drive me?

285
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:24,628
I'll phone you. Which motel?
- The Mirador. - We better hurry.

286
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:29,429
Try to get some sleep, Susie.
- That Mirador's mighty hard to find,

287
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:33,015
with the new highway
branching off like that... Hey!

288
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:37,103
That's alright, I can find my way.
- His cane!

289
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:42,101
I forgot to give him his cane.
He really needs it for that game leg.

290
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:45,694
Did he tell you how he got it?
- What, his cane? - No, his bad leg!

291
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:49,199
Who are you talking about?
- Captain Quinlan!

292
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:53,871
He got it in a gunfight.

293
00:29:54,381 --> 00:29:57,582
He was wounded stopping a bullet
that was meant for me.

294
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:01,961
But the bravest thing Hank ever did
was to give up drink.

295
00:30:02,181 --> 00:30:05,168
He used to be a terrible lush.

296
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:09,459
But look at him now: No sleep,
still at it. Yeah, he never gives up!

297
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:44,077
What's wrong? - Why are you
following us? Get out of the car!

298
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:50,756
A man can't take a ride
in his own car? - Come on!

299
00:30:50,977 --> 00:30:54,546
Wake up, Mrs Vargas.
We're here. This is it.

300
00:30:55,357 --> 00:30:59,720
This can't be it. - It's all the motel
we got this side of town, Ma'am.

301
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:04,308
The others are all on the new highway,
mostly closed till the season starts.

302
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:07,650
Oh no!
- Oh yeah!

303
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:12,945
How long are you gonna
hold me here? I didn't do nothing.

304
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:16,071
Can you identify this man?
- Of course. That's Grandi!

305
00:31:16,294 --> 00:31:20,243
I'm a member of the family, sure.
But nobody laid a hand on her!

306
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:22,872
Shut up. Get in the car.

307
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:28,126
What about my car?
- You can leave it here. - What, here?

308
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:31,548
In the middle of nowhere? - You're
coming with me! - On what charge?

309
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:34,589
I don't know yet.
That's for Quinlan to decide.

310
00:31:34,812 --> 00:31:40,552
What was Grandi doing way out here?
- He was following us in his car.

311
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:45,306
Where are my bags? - We've already
put them by your cabin.

312
00:31:45,698 --> 00:31:50,726
The last one, No. 7. - If you want
a change, just phone the desk.

313
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:56,064
Off season like this, I reckon
you're about the only one here.

314
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:53,334
I turned on the music for you
up at the office.

315
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:04,222
I turned the music up for you.

316
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,468
I thought you'd like it.
- Not just now.

317
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,426
It's past seven,
and I haven't been to bed yet.

318
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,811
You can get into it now.
I brought the sheets.

319
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:19,154
But if they think I'm gonna make it,
they got another thing comin'

320
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,400
I'm not gonna be a party to...

321
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,740
I'm the night man.

322
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,657
It's day already.

323
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,455
I'm the night man. - Have the day man
help me make the bed.

324
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:35,415
There ain't no day man.

325
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,246
He was supposed to be here
at 6 this morning.

326
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,924
Now they phone and tell me
he ain't comin' at all.

327
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,262
They're sendin' a new man.

328
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:50,924
If they think I'm waitin' for him...
- Won't you help me make the bed?

329
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,813
Bed?

330
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,727
Wait a minute!

331
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,894
Your friend,

332
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:04,271
Mr Grandi...
He ain't gonna leave you here long.

333
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,191
He is not my friend.

334
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,823
He brought you here
in that car, didn't he?

335
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,202
No, he didn't.
In fact, he's under arrest.

336
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:18,087
Under arrest? Mr Grandi?

337
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:21,214
Yes, he is!

338
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:33,601
Hold back that second charge!
Stop that car!

339
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,558
Hold that car! Stop!

340
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:47,864
There was a complaint
about some stolen dynamite out here.

341
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:51,700
You fired anybody lately?
- I figured you'd ask about that.

342
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:55,123
A boy named Sanchez?
- Sure.

343
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:57,626
He's been playing around
with the boss's daughter.

344
00:34:57,885 --> 00:35:01,620
I just recognized somebody.
- The one with the big ears?

345
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:06,508
We prosecuted him for voluntary
manslaughter. - That's Eddie Farnum.

346
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:12,964
Get out of here, we're gonna blast!
- How long've you been out?

347
00:35:13,192 --> 00:35:16,144
3 months. - Quick parole.
- Who got you the job?

348
00:35:16,362 --> 00:35:20,512
My lawyer, Howard Cranes.
- Grandi's lawyer.

349
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:23,978
Suspect now in custody.
- Well, this is it.

350
00:35:24,203 --> 00:35:28,021
Suspect? Is that Sanchez, the one
you've been talking about?

351
00:35:28,249 --> 00:35:32,197
They've located him, right?
- In Marcia Linnekar's apartment.

352
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:34,696
Stand still, we're gonna blast!

353
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:41,954
What's wrong, Farnum?
You short of dynamite?

354
00:35:58,695 --> 00:36:03,356
Captain, have you anything definite
on Sanchez? - Not yet.

355
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:07,440
I'm goin' on my intuition.
- This car belongs to Howard Cranes.

356
00:36:07,662 --> 00:36:11,196
You remember, that slick lawyer
that got Farnum a parole.

357
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:14,652
He was Rudy Linnekar's attorney, too.

358
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:17,410
Isn't that Quinlan?
- Quinlan?

359
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,412
I figured we'd have Quinlan
to deal with. You finished packing?

360
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:26,495
I've heard about that guy.
- Say nothing. Let's get your bag.

361
00:36:44,531 --> 00:36:48,515
Remember: I'll do all the talking.

362
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:54,021
How do we begin? Nasty questions first
or the rubber hose right away?

363
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:55,825
Take it easy.

364
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,020
Vargas?

365
00:37:00,379 --> 00:37:02,122
Yes, Captain?

366
00:37:04,092 --> 00:37:06,368
I got my orders, Vargas.

367
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:12,298
I'm to show you courtesy, but that
don't mean you do the interrogating.

368
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:15,172
I know, Captain.
That's what I told Sanchez.

369
00:37:15,394 --> 00:37:18,679
You're Ed Hansen?
- That's right, Captain.

370
00:37:18,898 --> 00:37:24,175
Go and get me some coffee, Ed.
How about you, Miss Linnekar? Coffee?

371
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:25,979
No thanks.

372
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:29,806
I really need it. I'm an old man.

373
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:33,188
I go a whole night without sleep,
I feel it.

374
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:36,697
Of course,
it was a lot worse for you.

375
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:43,284
You've been livin' here
for some time, Marcia. How long?

376
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:45,283
Four months.
- Marcia!

377
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:49,918
You have a quarrel with your dad?
- I'm Miss Linnekar's attorney.

378
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:54,880
I'm Manolo Sanchez,
and I haven't got an attorney!

379
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,835
You two been sharing this apartment?
- I must explain.

380
00:37:59,062 --> 00:38:03,212
My client is moving elsewhere.
- So she's been living with this man?

381
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:08,434
She'll be available for questions
later. I'll be present, of course.

382
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:12,306
Of course. Marcia, where was
your friend Sanchez last night?

383
00:38:12,534 --> 00:38:16,862
Later, Captain. Later,
after she's rested. Come, my dear.

384
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:23,696
Casey, would you look in the desk?
See if there are some letters...

385
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:28,781
Unless you've already looked.
- We were waitin' for you.

386
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:37,539
I... I don't speak Mexican.

387
00:38:41,395 --> 00:38:44,679
Let's keep it in English, Vargas.

388
00:38:45,775 --> 00:38:50,435
Fine by me. He's just as unpleasant
in any language. - Unpleasant?

389
00:38:50,654 --> 00:38:54,306
Strange, I've been told
I have a very winning personality.

390
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:57,022
The very best shoe clerk
the store ever had!

391
00:38:57,244 --> 00:39:01,442
You weren't a shoe clerk on that
construction crew. Stick around.

392
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:04,024
I intend to.

393
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,155
Speak in English.
I don't like to repeat myself.

394
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:11,161
I merely asked him
if I could used the telephone.

395
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:17,461
Translation:
"The telephone is in the bedroom."

396
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,039
That's all he said.

397
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:25,178
He also said he thinks
he's in for some sort of third degree.

398
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:28,432
I assured him
he had nothing to worry about.

399
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:33,511
Go in with Vargas. Maybe he don't know
how to use an American telephone.

400
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,310
I think I ran onto something.
Some love letters.

401
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:41,311
Go and read them in the bedroom.
I don't want to leave Vargas alone.

402
00:39:41,538 --> 00:39:43,896
Save the good stuff for me.

403
00:39:44,124 --> 00:39:48,367
Now, in English. - What do you
want to know? - Everything, boy.

404
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:51,323
Want me to call the motel, Vargas?
- Later.

405
00:39:51,547 --> 00:39:55,994
...how did you meet Linnekar's
daughter? - Selling her shoes.

406
00:39:56,218 --> 00:40:01,543
You took the construction job
to get your hands on some dynamite!

407
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:07,422
I'll only slap you if you get
hysterical again. Nothing brutal.

408
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:11,891
In the old days, we never hurt people
in the face. It marks them up.

409
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,598
We gave it to 'em like this!

410
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:20,106
Boy's getting a rough deal.
- He could even be innocent.

411
00:40:20,325 --> 00:40:25,271
Intuition? - Why not? Quinlan doesn't
have a monopoly on hunches.

412
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:30,239
Who do you like for the killer?
- It's still early, but that ex-convict.

413
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,075
Out on that highway job? Farnum.
- Maybe.

414
00:40:34,297 --> 00:40:39,739
Wait! Some dynamite was stolen.
- The crew's working for Linnekar.

415
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:45,674
Amigo, you're onto something.
- Quite an apartment for a shoe clerk.

416
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:50,041
Marcia pay for it? - What if she does?
- How long's this been going on?

417
00:40:50,271 --> 00:40:52,640
Ever since her father
had me fired from my last job.

418
00:40:52,857 --> 00:40:56,971
Naturally, he objected
to a Mexican show clerk as son-in-law,

419
00:40:57,195 --> 00:41:00,645
so you had to put him
out of the way. - Naturally!

420
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:05,482
Just because he speaks gilded,
that don't make him innocent.

421
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:10,398
You can show motive, but don't you
need a bit more? - We'll get it.

422
00:41:10,624 --> 00:41:12,448
There's my coffee.

423
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:16,402
Didn't you bring me
any doughnuts or sweet-rolls?

424
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,451
You'll have to put him
on the scene of the crime. - We will.

425
00:41:19,674 --> 00:41:23,041
You need evidence.
- We'll get it.

426
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:27,245
You didn't ask me to get doughnuts.
- Where are you going?

427
00:41:27,474 --> 00:41:31,541
This is not my case, Captain.
- What finally convinced you of that?

428
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,635
This isn't my country, that's all.
I'm not convinced.

429
00:41:35,857 --> 00:41:38,299
Ain't that a shame...

430
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:42,559
Is there another phone near here?
- Right across the street.

431
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:58,488
Excuse me, Madam,
could I use your telephone please?

432
00:41:58,712 --> 00:42:00,704
Right in front of you.

433
00:42:00,923 --> 00:42:02,866
Do you have a phone book?

434
00:42:03,092 --> 00:42:07,539
I'm blind. You'll have to ask
for information. - I'm sorry.

435
00:42:13,352 --> 00:42:17,384
Hello. I'd like the number
of the Mirador Motel.

436
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:19,716
What is this place?
- Get going.

437
00:42:19,942 --> 00:42:21,720
He didn't do anything.
- Go on!

438
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:24,764
Who's this?
- Don't push!

439
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:28,558
Quinlan? - He's in here, makin'
a search. - What am I doin here?

440
00:42:28,784 --> 00:42:32,317
Oh, Hank!
- What's the idea, barging in on me?

441
00:42:32,537 --> 00:42:35,489
What've we got in here?
- I came to give you your cane!

442
00:42:35,707 --> 00:42:41,281
Strange. When I was taking Mrs. Vargas
to the motel, I picked this guy up.

443
00:42:41,504 --> 00:42:44,954
That's Uncle Joe Grandi.
Why'd you bring him here?

444
00:42:45,175 --> 00:42:48,459
For some crazy reason,
he was following me in his car.

445
00:42:48,678 --> 00:42:51,001
He was tailin' you?

446
00:42:54,517 --> 00:42:57,006
Why would I be following a cop?
He's an idiot!

447
00:42:57,228 --> 00:43:04,309
Maybe you thought he was
a Mexican cop. It was Vargas' car.

448
00:43:04,527 --> 00:43:08,428
Right? - So I thought I was following
Vargas. So what?

449
00:43:08,656 --> 00:43:10,315
Sit down!

450
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:13,603
It's a free country.
- Shut up!

451
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:27,745
Is this the Mirador? I'm tryin'...
- Yes, it's the Mirador, and it's me.

452
00:43:28,258 --> 00:43:34,828
Darling, the news is bad. Quinlan is
about to arrest that boy, Sanchez.

453
00:43:35,057 --> 00:43:39,634
Is that why you called? To tell me
somebody's been arrested?

454
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:43,797
No, that's not really why I called.

455
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:48,887
It's to tell you
how sorry I am about all this,

456
00:43:49,113 --> 00:43:51,601
how very, very much I love you.

457
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:54,483
Susie?

458
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,688
I'm still here, my darling Miguel.

459
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:00,605
I thought maybe you fell asleep.

460
00:44:01,374 --> 00:44:06,283
I was just listening to you breathe.
It's a lovely sound.

461
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:09,619
But I am sleepy.

462
00:44:11,592 --> 00:44:17,581
Of course. Well, I'll be calling you
back later. Goodbye for now.

463
00:44:26,107 --> 00:44:28,181
Hello?
- Yes?

464
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:32,385
I just wanted to tell you,
I'm awfully tired...

465
00:44:32,613 --> 00:44:38,020
Excuse me, this is Mrs Vargas.
- I know. It couldn't be anybody else.

466
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,692
You're the only guest
we got here now. In the whole place.

467
00:44:43,331 --> 00:44:47,695
As I started to tell you:
There's no sign to put up on the door,

468
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:51,488
and I just wanted to be sure
I wouldn't be disturbed.

469
00:44:51,715 --> 00:44:53,872
That is, if you're the one in charge.

470
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:58,504
Don't worry, Mrs. Vargas.
I'm the one in charge here.

471
00:44:58,722 --> 00:45:02,373
Nobody'll get through to you,
unless I say so.

472
00:45:02,601 --> 00:45:05,837
Vargas. Sergeant Menzies
wanted me to give you this.

473
00:45:06,063 --> 00:45:09,014
Your car keys.
- Thanks.

474
00:45:13,987 --> 00:45:17,970
I thought we lost you for good.
- I had a call to make.

475
00:45:20,034 --> 00:45:21,609
English!

476
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:24,154
I'm being set up as the fall guy.
- Just a minute!

477
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,614
Sure, I'm the fortune-hunter
who hypnotized Marcia,

478
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,109
who made her kill her father
for his money.

479
00:45:30,336 --> 00:45:34,035
If I had that kind of power,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

480
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:36,994
So you don't care about the money?

481
00:45:37,218 --> 00:45:40,129
Why should I lie? Without the money,
I wouldn't have given her...

482
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:43,333
I told her that from the start.
But still she wanted...

483
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:47,458
Why bother. You wouldn't believe it!
- Try me.

484
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:49,963
I'm a good listener.

485
00:45:50,189 --> 00:45:54,090
Instead of the man chasing the girl,
suppose she was the one.

486
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,392
Suppose she asked him to marry her.

487
00:45:56,611 --> 00:46:01,058
Should he say: "No, you and I
could never be happy with your money?"

488
00:46:01,282 --> 00:46:03,890
What would you do?
- What did you do?

489
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:09,194
What did you do, boy?
- You know what I did, Captain!

490
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:15,037
Marcia and I made a bomb,
and we blew up her father!

491
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:19,452
You don't help yourself
by treating this as a joke.

492
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:23,708
You finished?
Anything more you want to say, Vargas?

493
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,962
No, Captain.
- Good. Pete, search the place.

494
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:32,880
I'm too tired for this. Sanchez' desk
has been looked into.

495
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:36,556
Take the bedroom and bathroom.

496
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,267
And be very thorough.

497
00:46:39,486 --> 00:46:46,021
How long do I have to sit here?
I wasn't breaking the law!

498
00:46:46,243 --> 00:46:49,361
I don't even know these people.
- You know Vargas. - Who's this?

499
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,774
Uncle Joe Grandi. You nabbed
his brother on a narcotics rap.

500
00:46:55,002 --> 00:46:59,615
I don't know this Grandi.
- I got nothing to do with your wife.

501
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,832
I'm an American citizen. Listen,
Vic was arrested in Mexico City.

502
00:47:05,054 --> 00:47:09,547
Vargas will testify at his trial.
It's got nothing to do with...

503
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:14,925
You just try any rough stuff,
and you got big trouble.

504
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:22,932
If anybody lays a hand on Vargas,
my brother's as good as convicted.

505
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:26,106
Hank? - What is it, Pete?
- I found it!

506
00:47:26,324 --> 00:47:29,774
Found what, partner?
- Come in here and look!

507
00:47:29,994 --> 00:47:34,939
I don't even know this Sanchez.
- Alright, boy. Come in here.

508
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:38,201
Just how much dynamite did you steal?

509
00:47:38,419 --> 00:47:41,973
I've never seen any dynamite!
- Poor Rudy Linnekar.

510
00:47:42,073 --> 00:47:44,446
He did everything
to keep you away from his daughter,

511
00:47:44,546 --> 00:47:47,750
but she'll inherit a million bucks,
so you just moved in.

512
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:51,622
We married secretly.
- A million bucks ain't no secret.

513
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:54,754
You got scared he'd change his will.

514
00:47:54,977 --> 00:47:58,139
You got yourself this highway job.
- You broke into the explosives bin!

515
00:47:58,314 --> 00:48:03,009
That's a lie! - You stole
10 sticks of dynamite. - No! No!

516
00:48:03,235 --> 00:48:05,926
Hank's done it again.
He's nailed his man!

517
00:48:06,154 --> 00:48:08,976
Thanks to you, partner.
- Me? Nah!

518
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,733
If that dynamite had been a snake,
it would've bitten me.

519
00:48:12,953 --> 00:48:17,779
I promised to keep you informed.
This is it. We've broken the case.

520
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:21,699
Linnekar was blown up
with 8 sticks of dynamite.

521
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,741
Sanchez stole 10, that leaves 2.

522
00:48:24,965 --> 00:48:29,577
And we found them both.
You heard that, boy.

523
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:36,334
That's impossible! Where did you find
this? - Right here in your love nest.

524
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,587
Where?
- Where you had it stashed.

525
00:48:38,812 --> 00:48:41,555
What are you trying to do?
- Strap you to the electric chair.

526
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:44,724
We don't like it when innocent people
are blown up in our town.

527
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:48,558
Last night an old lady
picked up a shoe.

528
00:48:48,779 --> 00:48:52,146
The shoe had a foot in it.
We'll make you pay for that.

529
00:48:52,366 --> 00:48:57,027
They're trying to railroad me!
I never stole any dynamite!

530
00:48:58,664 --> 00:49:04,321
You'll have to stop him yourself.
- He can talk Hindu for all I care.

531
00:49:04,545 --> 00:49:09,656
He swears on his mother's grave that
there was never any dynamite here.

532
00:49:09,884 --> 00:49:12,123
Sure, sure...

533
00:49:12,386 --> 00:49:15,256
Take him in. Book him.
- Let's go.

534
00:49:16,015 --> 00:49:20,793
You say you found this dynamite in the
bathroom. - Pete found it. Show him.

535
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:24,718
Can't you do something to help me?

536
00:49:26,024 --> 00:49:29,474
What are you scared of, partner?

537
00:49:29,694 --> 00:49:33,595
That stuff doesn't blow up as easy
as people think.

538
00:49:33,823 --> 00:49:38,317
You found the dynamite in this box?
- Dynamite?

539
00:49:38,536 --> 00:49:41,940
Yeah, Pete found it. I told you that.

540
00:49:42,165 --> 00:49:44,025
Captain...
- Yeah?

541
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:50,444
I looked in that box, just now.
There wasn't anything there.

542
00:49:53,176 --> 00:49:55,203
I know how you feel.

543
00:49:55,428 --> 00:49:58,119
Do you?
- Sure I do.

544
00:49:58,348 --> 00:50:00,873
You people are touchy.

545
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:05,677
It's only human you'd want to
defend your fellow countrymen.

546
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:15,518
Vargas, don't worry.
- Why should I worry?

547
00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:20,316
Go ahead and say what you want.
Folks'll bear your prejudice in mind.

548
00:50:20,536 --> 00:50:24,947
I saw that shoe box ten minutes ago.
- Well, maybe you didn't notice.

549
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:29,410
I knocked it over. I couldn't have
failed to notice 2 sticks of dynamite.

550
00:50:29,628 --> 00:50:33,244
Tell any story you want!
Go and say it was empty.

551
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:37,330
I'm saying more than that, Captain.

552
00:50:37,553 --> 00:50:40,504
You framed that boy. Framed him!

553
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:52,213
Is he crazy, Hank?
- That must be it, crazy.

554
00:50:52,442 --> 00:50:55,975
What are we gonna go with Grandi?
Take him in? - Grandi.

555
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:59,100
You ought to realize,
if Vargas is willing to testify...

556
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:02,145
Who are you working for,
the Mexican government?

557
00:51:02,368 --> 00:51:04,442
No, for the District Attorney.

558
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:08,313
I got a position in this town,
a reputation! Who's Vargas?

559
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:12,608
Vargas has, too. Somebody'll have to
give in on this thing.

560
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:14,946
Either that or somebody'll be ruined.

561
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:18,042
Captain Quinlan...
- What do you want?

562
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:23,337
You saw that shoebox.
You know it was empty.

563
00:51:23,556 --> 00:51:27,338
I didn't happen
to see it myself, but...

564
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:29,716
I believe you.

565
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:38,016
We're are both after
the same exact thing, Captain.

566
00:51:38,236 --> 00:51:41,521
If Vargas goes on like this...

567
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:46,602
Move along. Stop making trouble.
- Trouble? Who's making trouble?

568
00:51:46,828 --> 00:51:51,026
Vargas! For my brother Vic
in Mexico City, for you here.

569
00:51:51,249 --> 00:51:54,653
Go peddle your papers, Uncle Joe.
- You just said it yourself:

570
00:51:54,878 --> 00:52:01,827
Somebody's reputation'll be ruined.
Why not Vargas?

571
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:07,210
What are you waitin' for?
We got work to do! - Okay, Hank.

572
00:52:07,515 --> 00:52:11,166
What do you want?
- Nothing that you don't want, too.

573
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:13,420
Spit it out then.

574
00:52:13,646 --> 00:52:16,551
Captain,
we can't stand here in the street.

575
00:52:16,774 --> 00:52:23,593
Let's go somewhere nice and private,
where we can sit and have a drink.

576
00:52:24,615 --> 00:52:27,187
I don't drink.

577
00:53:19,419 --> 00:53:22,454
Look, Schwartz...
- Al.

578
00:53:22,672 --> 00:53:25,541
We must show where
Quinlan himself got the dynamite.

579
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:29,043
If you're really with me on this,
we have to get some proof.

580
00:53:29,262 --> 00:53:31,833
We've got your word.
- Let's do better than that.

581
00:53:32,056 --> 00:53:36,300
In your country, too, when explosives
are purchased, a record is kept.

582
00:53:36,518 --> 00:53:40,383
And we're going to look it up.
How about Quinlan's ranch?

583
00:53:40,606 --> 00:53:42,964
Where's that?
- Just outside town.

584
00:53:43,192 --> 00:53:46,595
While you're looking for the records,
I'll go out there.

585
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:50,354
One thing worries me still.
- What's that?

586
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:55,103
I could be wrong about this.
That would be very bad for you.

587
00:53:55,329 --> 00:53:58,102
Let's see if you're wrong first.

588
00:54:21,062 --> 00:54:25,260
Could you turn that music off?

589
00:54:27,902 --> 00:54:32,729
Could you ask
those people next door to move?

590
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:34,892
I'm trying to sleep.

591
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:37,773
Where should I take you, doll?

592
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:45,409
You got the stuff?

593
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,578
I brought that.
The other guys got more.

594
00:54:57,681 --> 00:55:01,001
What are you doing here?
Turn it down!

595
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,801
I'm the night man.
- Yeah?

596
00:55:08,024 --> 00:55:13,052
A little early, ain't you?
- I thought I'd see if the new...

597
00:55:22,414 --> 00:55:26,197
Which one of you is the day man?
- I am!

598
00:55:26,418 --> 00:55:27,898
Beat it.

599
00:55:30,714 --> 00:55:34,246
It's a mile and a half
down to the highway...

600
00:55:37,428 --> 00:55:42,290
I think I'd better stay. - Go in
the kitchen and get something to eat.

601
00:55:48,064 --> 00:55:52,344
I brought my lunch.
- Eat it now.

602
00:55:52,568 --> 00:55:53,768
Now?

603
00:56:01,035 --> 00:56:04,152
I know you. You're the Grandi boys.

604
00:56:04,371 --> 00:56:08,355
Your Uncle Joe know you're here?
- Who could that be?

605
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:11,358
Take it easy, pretty boy.
What's the sweat about?

606
00:56:11,587 --> 00:56:17,326
It's a tough rap to get caught with
this! - It's only the Vargas dame.

607
00:56:18,426 --> 00:56:21,829
Yes Ma'am?
- Get me 1-2-1-2.

608
00:56:22,055 --> 00:56:25,422
Very good. 1-2-1-2.

609
00:56:29,896 --> 00:56:32,302
That's the police!
- Yeah?

610
00:56:32,524 --> 00:56:34,052
It's the police alright.

611
00:56:34,442 --> 00:56:37,216
What do we do now?
- Nothing...

612
00:56:37,445 --> 00:56:41,346
Just relax and have ourselves a ball.

613
00:56:42,826 --> 00:56:48,020
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Vargas.
Phone's temporarily out of service.

614
00:56:48,248 --> 00:56:51,899
I'll call you
just as soon as it's repaired.

615
00:56:53,086 --> 00:56:54,780
Better call Uncle Joe.

616
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:11,716
So that is our little arrangement?

617
00:57:11,937 --> 00:57:14,260
A real sweet setup.

618
00:57:15,149 --> 00:57:19,014
And all the help...
- Listen, if you knock somebody off,

619
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:23,648
there won't be any little arrangement.
Not with Hank Quinlan!

620
00:57:23,866 --> 00:57:28,110
It's for you. - Yeah.
- Vargas can't hurt me.

621
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:34,531
Maybe not. But maybe,
with our little deal, we can hurt him.

622
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:37,277
I don't make deals.

623
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:52,924
Something wrong? - Nothing we can't
fix. - Where'd you get that "we"?

624
00:57:53,144 --> 00:57:55,716
I haven't given you an answer yet.

625
00:57:56,814 --> 00:58:00,882
You talk like this was some deal
where I ask you

626
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:07,099
to get me out of a rap.
No, that ain't it at all.

627
00:58:07,325 --> 00:58:12,187
In this thing we're partners.
Shall we drink to that?

628
00:58:12,413 --> 00:58:14,357
I don't...

629
00:58:18,668 --> 00:58:22,237
Juanita, two more double bourbons.

630
00:58:27,594 --> 00:58:29,952
Make 'em nice and big.

631
00:58:52,494 --> 00:58:55,232
This better be important!
- It is.

632
00:58:55,455 --> 00:59:01,574
We're crazy to even be here in Mexico.
- Vargas, you sent for us?

633
00:59:01,794 --> 00:59:07,333
Not really. Mr. Schwartz insisted
that I ... - Let's get to the case.

634
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,953
Chief Gould, Mr. Vargas.
- Where's this so-called document?

635
00:59:11,178 --> 00:59:13,335
Perhaps we'd better go to my room.

636
00:59:14,014 --> 00:59:17,797
In here, gentlemen.
- Go ahead. - No, I'll walk.

637
00:59:18,018 --> 00:59:21,919
The lift is rather small.
Chief Gould...

638
00:59:23,607 --> 00:59:28,516
Just press the second floor button,
I'll meet you there.

639
00:59:29,447 --> 00:59:32,932
I still don't know
why Vargas couldn't come to my office.

640
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:37,819
He has practically cabinet status.
- If he's so important...

641
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:43,742
He can't make a formal call on you
without going though his consulate.

642
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,485
Cut the fancy talk.
What does it boil down to?

643
00:59:46,713 --> 00:59:51,575
This Mexican's bringing charges
against a respected police officer!

644
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:54,327
That's what it boils down to!

645
00:59:54,554 --> 00:59:57,459
You must be quick on your feet!

646
00:59:57,682 --> 01:00:01,796
The lift is just slow.
This way, gentlemen.

647
01:00:07,484 --> 01:00:09,178
Thank you.

648
01:00:11,654 --> 01:00:13,894
I have it right over here.

649
01:00:16,242 --> 01:00:17,522
There.

650
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:22,937
While you're looking at it,
allow me to finish a call.

651
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:27,941
Where'd you get this?
- From your department of records.

652
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,197
It doesn't mean anything!

653
01:00:30,964 --> 01:00:34,035
Are you calling your wife?
You know who owns the Mirador?

654
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:38,409
June 18,
Hill's Hardware in Los Robles.

655
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,623
17 sticks, "Black Fox" brand,
to H. Quinlan.

656
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:46,088
Quinlan needed dynamite
for his ranch. Simple coincidence.

657
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:48,673
Mr. Adair... Hello?

658
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:58,148
Mirador? My name is Vargas.
I'd like to speak with my wife.

659
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:02,185
I'm very sorry, but your wife
left definite instructions.

660
01:01:02,413 --> 01:01:04,022
She's not to be disturbed.

661
01:01:09,168 --> 01:01:10,448
Honey!

662
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,325
You, in the next room!

663
01:01:14,173 --> 01:01:15,915
What is it?

664
01:01:16,134 --> 01:01:19,999
Come to the wall,
so I can whisper.

665
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:24,883
Yes?

666
01:01:26,144 --> 01:01:30,009
You know what the boys
are trying to do, don't you?

667
01:01:32,316 --> 01:01:37,593
They're trying to get in there.
They went to get the master key.

668
01:01:38,531 --> 01:01:41,851
You know
what marijuana is, don't you?

669
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:46,478
Yes...

670
01:01:47,664 --> 01:01:50,272
You know what a Mary Jane is?

671
01:01:52,335 --> 01:01:55,453
You know what a mainliner is?

672
01:01:58,091 --> 01:02:02,241
I think so.
But what's that got to do with me?

673
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:06,797
You take it in the vein.

674
01:02:08,018 --> 01:02:11,918
You're telling me
the boys are drugged? Is that why...

675
01:02:14,191 --> 01:02:18,851
You think
they're ready for that stuff yet?

676
01:02:19,071 --> 01:02:21,180
Not yet, kid.

677
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,565
The fun is only beginning.

678
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,490
Hank, I've been looking
for you in every bar in town.

679
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:36,492
I've been in half of them,
only on the wrong side of the border.

680
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:40,330
I never drink on my own beat.
- Give us some black coffee, quick!

681
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:45,957
I don't need black coffee. - We're
meeting Vargas at his hotel. - Motel?

682
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:50,508
Right here, across the street.
- I don't need any coffee yet.

683
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:51,969
Not yet?

684
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:56,135
This is a swell time to get fried!
- My job's over, Pete.

685
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:58,431
You oughtta work on Sanchez.

686
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:02,801
Vargas is telling the D.A.
That you planted the dynamite. - Fool.

687
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,855
They're takin' him seriously.

688
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:10,149
I mean Sanchez. Dynamite's no way
to kill. Did I tell you the smart way?

689
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:14,698
Sure. Strangling.
- Clean, silent.

690
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,607
You told me all that.
Come on, finish your coffee.

691
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:22,579
I don't usually talk about my wife.
- Never when you're sober.

692
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,537
She was strangled, Pete.
- I know.

693
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,381
She was working at a packing plant.
The killer had the cord right there.

694
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:36,011
No fingerprints on a piece of string.
- What do I owe you?

695
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:40,427
That half-breed done it.
But I was just a rooky cop.

696
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,250
$ 4.75.

697
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:47,101
I followed him around,
eating my heart out,

698
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:51,437
tryin' to catch him,
but I never did.

699
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:56,439
Then the Lord done the job for me
in some mud-hole in Belgium in 1917.

700
01:03:56,665 --> 01:04:00,530
That was the last killer
that ever got out of my hands.

701
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,574
Where're you going?
- To Se単or Vargas' meeting.

702
01:04:03,797 --> 01:04:08,410
He wants to fight dirty, OK.
That's the fight he's gonna get.

703
01:04:08,635 --> 01:04:10,627
Perhaps...
- What?

704
01:04:10,846 --> 01:04:15,257
Perhaps he honestly thinks Sanchez
is guilty. - No "perhaps" about it.

705
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:19,092
Hank Quinlan is an honest cop.
- There are all kinds of policemen.

706
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:22,182
A few take bribes...

707
01:04:22,399 --> 01:04:25,386
Quinlan never took a dollar.
- Most are honest, yes...

708
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:31,314
But even some of the honest men
abuse their power in other ways.

709
01:04:31,532 --> 01:04:32,977
Come in, Hank.

710
01:04:34,952 --> 01:04:39,696
I don't know
whether I'm welcome or not.

711
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:42,689
I want you to hear this.

712
01:04:43,878 --> 01:04:46,154
I've heard it already.

713
01:04:46,381 --> 01:04:49,831
Our friend Vargas has some
special ideas about police procedure.

714
01:04:50,051 --> 01:04:53,916
Seems to think it don't matter
whether a killer is hanged or not.

715
01:04:54,138 --> 01:04:56,912
A policeman isn't a dog-catcher,

716
01:04:57,141 --> 01:04:59,797
putting criminals behind bars. No!

717
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:03,469
In a free country, a policeman
is supposed to enforce the law.

718
01:05:03,689 --> 01:05:06,974
The law protects guilty and innocent.
- Our job is tough enough.

719
01:05:07,193 --> 01:05:09,765
It has to be tough.

720
01:05:09,987 --> 01:05:14,683
A policeman's job is only easy
in a police state. That's the point!

721
01:05:14,908 --> 01:05:18,026
Who's the boss, the cop or the law?

722
01:05:18,245 --> 01:05:20,770
Where's your wife, Vargas?

723
01:05:20,997 --> 01:05:26,440
You know as well as I do.
Sgt. Menzies drove her to the motel.

724
01:05:28,213 --> 01:05:29,611
You're still here?

725
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,907
I'm checking out now and joining her.
Any reason for asking?

726
01:05:34,136 --> 01:05:36,791
No. No special reason at all.

727
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:39,420
I just wondered...

728
01:05:40,225 --> 01:05:44,257
Whaddya know! Mother pigeon
and her nest...

729
01:05:44,479 --> 01:05:45,924
A pigeon egg.

730
01:05:46,148 --> 01:05:48,886
You did buy 17 sticks of dynamite?

731
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:52,641
You're telling a story.
I don't have to answer your questions.

732
01:05:52,862 --> 01:05:57,640
The hired hand at your ranch says
he used 15 sticks. - My ranch!

733
01:05:59,452 --> 01:06:02,736
You been spying out at my ranch?

734
01:06:03,205 --> 01:06:05,731
Foreigner!
- Without my knowledge, Hank!

735
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:10,701
15 sticks. That leaves 2 missing, and
2 sticks were found in that shoebox!

736
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:13,280
He's just asking, Hank.

737
01:06:14,425 --> 01:06:16,783
What's that for?

738
01:06:17,803 --> 01:06:20,079
It's for letting him ask.
- Hank, wait!

739
01:06:20,306 --> 01:06:27,387
30 years! 30 years on the beat,
30 years of dirt and crummy pay...

740
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:30,220
Watch your blood pressure!
- And you allow this foreigner...

741
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:34,809
We were just giving you
a chance to answer. - Answer? No, sir!

742
01:06:35,028 --> 01:06:40,305
I won't take back that badge until
the people of this county vote for it!

743
01:06:40,533 --> 01:06:42,358
Will you listen a minute?

744
01:06:42,577 --> 01:06:46,442
I don't ever want to see that man
at headquarters again!

745
01:06:46,664 --> 01:06:51,111
You backed him up! You stood by
while he impugned the integrity...

746
01:06:51,336 --> 01:06:54,821
I tried to stop him!
- You realize what Vargas has done?

747
01:06:55,048 --> 01:06:58,368
He's smearing hundreds of fine men!

748
01:06:58,593 --> 01:07:02,660
Have you caused enough trouble?
I want you to apologize!

749
01:07:02,889 --> 01:07:04,336
To Quinlan?
- And Chief Gould!

750
01:07:04,436 --> 01:07:08,084
Should I get on my knees?
- If you had any decency, you would!

751
01:07:08,311 --> 01:07:13,553
I won't give you the chance
to test your authority in this matter.

752
01:07:17,778 --> 01:07:22,439
Al, have I still
any credit left with you?

753
01:07:22,658 --> 01:07:28,445
Some. - Where can I find the records
of Quinlan's old cases?

754
01:07:28,664 --> 01:07:33,111
I'll show you. - I'd like to get back
to my wife. I hope it won't take long.

755
01:07:33,877 --> 01:07:37,529
Hank, you're not going without this.

756
01:07:44,012 --> 01:07:45,493
Well...

757
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:49,840
Now I guess I can talk.
- What do you mean, Hank?

758
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:54,554
Well, I couldn't really say it
in my own defense. - Go on, Hank.

759
01:07:54,773 --> 01:07:57,344
What do you know about Vargas?

760
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:01,266
Isn't he in charge of some cleanup
on this side of the border?

761
01:08:01,487 --> 01:08:04,605
Narcotics, mainly?
- Narcotics...

762
01:08:05,324 --> 01:08:07,850
He's a drug addict.

763
01:08:08,077 --> 01:08:11,112
He's got
that young wife of his hooked, too.

764
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:16,607
If I hadn't seen that hypodermic
myself ... - Hypodermic! You saw it?

765
01:08:16,836 --> 01:08:20,701
I just said so, didn't I?
- Are you sure?

766
01:08:20,923 --> 01:08:25,785
That's how he come to imagine
all those crazy things. It's typical.

767
01:08:26,012 --> 01:08:29,497
That's what his wife was doing
in that dive on skid row.

768
01:08:29,724 --> 01:08:35,263
Both a couple of junkies.
He's usin' the job as a cover-up.

769
01:08:36,481 --> 01:08:39,349
You don't mean he's mixed up
in this dope racket himself?

770
01:08:39,566 --> 01:08:41,723
Hank, if this
is just one of your hunches...

771
01:08:41,943 --> 01:08:47,185
I don't ask you to believe it.
I know it's not my department, but...

772
01:08:48,909 --> 01:08:52,312
I'd like to show you I'm not
talking out of the back of my neck.

773
01:08:52,537 --> 01:08:56,486
Just be careful, huh?
- Chief, I'll be very careful.

774
01:08:58,251 --> 01:09:02,235
This takes guts, Al.
Standing up to your boss this way.

775
01:09:02,464 --> 01:09:07,575
You could do me a favor: Help me
look for an office. - How's that?

776
01:09:07,803 --> 01:09:11,537
Quinlan's intuition may still turn out
to be better that yours.

777
01:09:11,765 --> 01:09:16,045
If so, my intuition tells me I'll be
going back to private practice.

778
01:09:16,269 --> 01:09:20,632
Here are the other names you want.
- Look, I can finish this alone.

779
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,345
And maybe you can't.

780
01:09:24,318 --> 01:09:26,226
Well, let me try anyway.

781
01:09:26,445 --> 01:09:29,267
I have no right
to drag you further into this.

782
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:32,442
Gonna do it alone, huh?
Just solve the murder,

783
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:36,478
and also prove that the idol
of the police force is a fraud.

784
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:42,066
Amigo, you've got your work
really cut out for you.

785
01:10:28,173 --> 01:10:31,457
Hello Tanya. Is Captain Quinlan there?

786
01:10:32,135 --> 01:10:34,458
Now, Sargeant!
- Tanya!

787
01:10:35,722 --> 01:10:37,546
I'll be right there!

788
01:10:38,975 --> 01:10:41,879
What would Quinlan be doing here?

789
01:10:42,102 --> 01:10:46,347
He used to hole himself up at your
place for days with a case of whiskey.

790
01:10:46,565 --> 01:10:50,099
That was years ago.
Now he's on candy bars.

791
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:51,681
Not tonight.

792
01:11:48,918 --> 01:11:52,154
No, lemme stay. I wanna watch.

793
01:11:54,132 --> 01:11:56,241
Hold her legs!

794
01:11:59,178 --> 01:12:02,747
No, let me go! Don't touch me! No!

795
01:12:04,808 --> 01:12:07,001
Close the door.

796
01:12:18,905 --> 01:12:22,854
So, this is where
you've been all afternoon?

797
01:12:23,702 --> 01:12:27,187
How'd they let you in here?
A foreigner.

798
01:12:27,414 --> 01:12:32,027
Hall of records is open to the public.
- What are you doing?

799
01:12:32,252 --> 01:12:36,948
You'll find out tomorrow morning.
- I want to know now!

800
01:12:42,304 --> 01:12:44,875
What's all this?
- Records of every case

801
01:12:45,097 --> 01:12:48,417
where you or Quinlan
uncovered the principle evidence.

802
01:12:48,642 --> 01:12:54,596
In each case, the defense denied
the existence of that evidence.

803
01:12:55,399 --> 01:12:57,722
Are you tryin' to break him?

804
01:12:57,943 --> 01:12:59,143
Him?

805
01:12:59,862 --> 01:13:02,268
What about you?

806
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:05,311
You never
planted any evidence, Sergeant?

807
01:13:05,534 --> 01:13:08,142
Of course not. Neither did Hank!

808
01:13:08,371 --> 01:13:12,864
It's all there: The axe in the Burger
murder, the dentures in the Yule case.

809
01:13:13,084 --> 01:13:15,407
Planting evidence, framing suspects!

810
01:13:15,628 --> 01:13:18,235
That's a lie!
- I think I can prove it, Sergeant.

811
01:13:18,464 --> 01:13:22,033
Sure, you can smear him,

812
01:13:22,676 --> 01:13:25,414
ruin his whole life's work.

813
01:13:26,262 --> 01:13:29,582
Vargas, I don't even know where he is.

814
01:13:30,934 --> 01:13:35,297
That's what you've done to him.
- What I've done? - Yeah...

815
01:13:35,522 --> 01:13:39,256
He's on an important case,
and he's disappeared.

816
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:42,635
Good and drunk, probably.

817
01:13:43,488 --> 01:13:46,144
After 12 years on the wagon.

818
01:13:46,866 --> 01:13:49,189
That's what you've done to him.

819
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:55,813
What about Quinlan, Sergeant?

820
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:59,029
What's he done?

821
01:13:59,254 --> 01:14:03,286
What about all those people
he put in the death-house?

822
01:14:04,134 --> 01:14:07,369
Save your tears for them.

823
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,641
What seems to be the trouble?
- Trouble?

824
01:14:31,869 --> 01:14:36,814
The lights. The lights
seem to be out in all the cabins.

825
01:14:39,793 --> 01:14:43,362
Somebody's been
monkeyin' with them fuses.

826
01:14:43,589 --> 01:14:46,955
If they think I'm gonna fix 'em,
they got another thing comin'

827
01:14:47,176 --> 01:14:50,874
It ain't my job to fix 'em,
even if I know how.

828
01:14:51,095 --> 01:14:54,747
Could you please
show me to my wife's cabin?

829
01:14:57,018 --> 01:14:58,218
No.

830
01:14:58,936 --> 01:15:01,627
Ain't nobody here.

831
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:08,887
You must be mistaken. My wife's been
registered here since this morning.

832
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,766
My name is Vargas.

833
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:15,900
Vargas? - Would you look
in the register, please?

834
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,147
The register?

835
01:15:25,713 --> 01:15:29,448
It might be cabin 6.
- Possibly...

836
01:15:29,966 --> 01:15:32,918
Maybe 7.
- Yes... here.

837
01:15:40,977 --> 01:15:42,377
May I?

838
01:15:44,147 --> 01:15:48,096
There's nobody
been registered all week.

839
01:15:48,318 --> 01:15:52,219
No, it's off the season.

840
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:56,561
Nobody hardly comes around at all.

841
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,607
I'm the night man.

842
01:16:07,421 --> 01:16:09,779
There was that party...

843
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:12,862
Party? What party?

844
01:16:14,385 --> 01:16:17,788
It's a mess, awful mess.
- Where?

845
01:16:18,014 --> 01:16:20,966
If they think I'm gonna clean it up,
they got another thing comin'

846
01:16:21,183 --> 01:16:23,506
Terrible brawl.

847
01:16:26,772 --> 01:16:28,550
Cabin number 7.

848
01:16:30,818 --> 01:16:34,932
In the middle of the afternoon!
Cabin number 7.

849
01:16:43,622 --> 01:16:48,864
This brawl. You mean
there was some sort of fight?

850
01:16:49,086 --> 01:16:50,946
Fight?
- Yes.

851
01:16:51,172 --> 01:16:55,238
No.
No, it wasn't that kind of a brawl.

852
01:17:01,139 --> 01:17:04,790
It was one of them wild parties.
You know the kind?

853
01:17:24,704 --> 01:17:26,813
This can't be my wife's room.

854
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,909
This ain't her clothes, huh?

855
01:17:30,126 --> 01:17:32,948
It stinks in here!

856
01:17:34,129 --> 01:17:37,164
Let's get some air in here.

857
01:17:39,009 --> 01:17:43,077
It's a mess, it's a stinkin' mess!
Those wild parties!

858
01:17:43,305 --> 01:17:47,373
There's my briefcase.
I left it with Susan, it...

859
01:17:54,066 --> 01:17:56,555
I'm gettin' outta here!

860
01:17:56,777 --> 01:17:58,377
My gun!

861
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:04,900
You haven't been here?
You haven't been in that room?

862
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:10,230
I just looked in.
- I had a gun in this case!

863
01:18:10,457 --> 01:18:14,606
You didn't take it?
- What would I want with a gun?

864
01:18:14,836 --> 01:18:17,242
Well, somebody wanted it!

865
01:18:18,423 --> 01:18:21,292
If they hadn't put that Grandi boy
on the desk this morning,

866
01:18:21,509 --> 01:18:23,618
this wouldn't have happened.
- Grandi?

867
01:18:23,845 --> 01:18:27,994
Who d'you think this belongs to?
- Where are they?

868
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,256
The kids?
- Yes.

869
01:18:32,478 --> 01:18:33,758
Please!

870
01:18:35,023 --> 01:18:38,177
Rancho!
- Rancho Grande? - Yes.

871
01:19:12,392 --> 01:19:16,127
You got her undressed?
- We scattered the reefers around.

872
01:19:16,355 --> 01:19:20,339
You didn't use
none of that stuff yourselves, huh?

873
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:22,178
You think we're crazy?

874
01:19:22,402 --> 01:19:26,552
No Grandi gets hooked.
Understand? That's the rule.

875
01:19:26,782 --> 01:19:28,808
We blew smoke on her clothes,
that's all.

876
01:19:29,034 --> 01:19:32,069
We put on a good show, to scare her.

877
01:19:32,913 --> 01:19:35,438
Let's hope it was good enough.

878
01:19:35,665 --> 01:19:40,491
When she wakes up, she's gotta think
maybe something did happen.

879
01:19:40,711 --> 01:19:45,039
Now beat it.
- What about our dough?

880
01:19:45,257 --> 01:19:49,835
We weren't doing it for fun.
- You'll get your dough tomorrow.

881
01:19:50,054 --> 01:19:51,254
Okay.

882
01:19:51,681 --> 01:19:53,079
Beat it.

883
01:20:33,263 --> 01:20:36,168
Turn out the light.
- Why?

884
01:20:39,519 --> 01:20:41,961
Nobody can see you up here.

885
01:20:43,982 --> 01:20:48,014
You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

886
01:20:52,615 --> 01:20:54,607
What are you doing?

887
01:20:56,870 --> 01:21:01,529
I brought you up here for a reason.
- I don't get it.

888
01:21:01,749 --> 01:21:07,572
I don't even see why we had to
bring her all the way to town.

889
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:11,330
I couldn't drive out to the motel.
My car's known.

890
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,826
So what?
You're a cop making an arrest.

891
01:21:14,053 --> 01:21:16,660
The vice boys will do that.

892
01:21:16,889 --> 01:21:18,797
What's that for?

893
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:26,847
Turn around!

894
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,183
Get the phone.

895
01:21:39,286 --> 01:21:42,023
Now dial 1-2-1-2.

896
01:21:42,246 --> 01:21:44,984
That's the police!
- Go on, dial it!

897
01:21:46,918 --> 01:21:52,622
Stop, Quinlan. You're drunk.
Just stop and think for a minute!

898
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:57,785
See if they answer.

899
01:22:01,974 --> 01:22:05,425
Ask for Sergeant Menzies.

900
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:08,553
Sergeant Menzies.

901
01:22:10,858 --> 01:22:15,519
Quinlan, if you turn me in,
I'll have quite a story to tell.

902
01:22:17,156 --> 01:22:19,396
You sure will.

903
01:22:19,826 --> 01:22:23,228
See if it's Menzies.
- Hello? Menzies?

904
01:22:23,453 --> 01:22:26,488
Got him?
Hand me the phone.

905
01:22:26,707 --> 01:22:29,362
Hold it so I can talk.
Give me the receiver!

906
01:22:30,836 --> 01:22:32,613
Hello, Pete!

907
01:22:34,715 --> 01:22:38,533
Of course it's me.
Any news yet?

908
01:22:38,969 --> 01:22:42,004
Sanchez still hasn't broken.

909
01:22:42,931 --> 01:22:44,131
What?

910
01:22:45,017 --> 01:22:48,134
Vargas' wife? A narcotics rap?

911
01:22:48,353 --> 01:22:53,132
One of the boys
was onto this wild party.

912
01:22:55,027 --> 01:23:01,846
Just relay it to the vice boys
as anonymous. Hotel Ritz, room 18.

913
01:23:02,576 --> 01:23:08,231
Things got a little out of control.
Don't be surprised what they find.

914
01:23:09,123 --> 01:23:12,407
What about me, Hank? What do I do?

915
01:23:12,626 --> 01:23:15,827
Keep after him! Break him!

916
01:23:17,923 --> 01:23:20,163
Put up the phone.

917
01:23:22,178 --> 01:23:24,002
The receiver!

918
01:23:24,221 --> 01:23:26,379
Gimme the key.

919
01:23:38,903 --> 01:23:42,602
I told you
I brought you up for a reason.

920
01:25:31,804 --> 01:25:34,246
Help! Somebody help me!

921
01:27:38,428 --> 01:27:42,673
Listen, I'm no cop now,
I'm a husband!

922
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:47,551
What did you do with her?
Where's my wife? My wife!

923
01:28:05,204 --> 01:28:06,446
Vargas!

924
01:28:07,414 --> 01:28:11,030
It's your wife, Vargas.
They picked her up.

925
01:28:12,127 --> 01:28:16,325
What do you mean, "picked her up"?
- The vice squad.

926
01:28:16,548 --> 01:28:17,946
Quinlan?

927
01:28:19,385 --> 01:28:22,123
You better come out with me, amigo.

928
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:30,004
No, don't. Tell me what happened!
- They found her at the Hotel Ritz,

929
01:28:30,229 --> 01:28:32,635
half-naked on the bed, drugged.

930
01:28:32,855 --> 01:28:35,095
There were reefer stubs
and a heroin fix.

931
01:28:35,316 --> 01:28:36,714
Vargas!

932
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:41,681
The charge isn't just possession
of narcotics. - What is it then?

933
01:28:41,948 --> 01:28:43,548
Murder.

934
01:29:03,469 --> 01:29:06,919
Darling... it's alright now, Susie.

935
01:29:10,101 --> 01:29:13,587
It's all in the report.
They found evidence of a mixed party.

936
01:29:14,688 --> 01:29:19,016
Mixed party? - Articles of clothing,
half-smoked reefers, needle marks.

937
01:29:19,776 --> 01:29:23,808
Could've been something else:
Demerol or sodium pentothal.

938
01:29:24,823 --> 01:29:28,973
You could smell the stuff on her.
- This whole setup stinks!

939
01:29:29,202 --> 01:29:33,780
Who does Quinlan think he is,
hanging a murder rap on my wife?

940
01:29:35,876 --> 01:29:37,949
Susie, lie down.

941
01:29:42,341 --> 01:29:43,655
Take me home.

942
01:29:47,262 --> 01:29:49,170
Forgive me.

943
01:29:57,396 --> 01:30:00,004
Don't go!
- I'm right here.

944
01:30:00,649 --> 01:30:02,130
It's alright.

945
01:30:24,799 --> 01:30:28,866
You know there's no formal charge
against your wife? - Oh?

946
01:30:29,095 --> 01:30:35,463
Even vice isn't pressing anything.
- And that makes everything alright?

947
01:30:35,685 --> 01:30:41,803
I got something to show you!
- Her good name hasn't been touched!

948
01:31:06,172 --> 01:31:09,207
I found it in the hotel room.

949
01:31:12,137 --> 01:31:14,294
With Grandi's body.

950
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:16,637
He's still just sitting in there.
- We've been waiting 3 hours already.

951
01:32:16,866 --> 01:32:20,102
We won't get a word on this,
as long as he's near that piano.

952
01:32:20,328 --> 01:32:26,400
Would you go in and shut it off?
- No, I have to get him out.

953
01:32:26,626 --> 01:32:29,827
Give me the microphone.
- I can take care of this.

954
01:32:30,046 --> 01:32:31,906
Not without me.

955
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:35,914
You know that Grandi kid we picked up?

956
01:32:36,135 --> 01:32:39,170
Stand quietly.
- He started to talk.

957
01:32:39,389 --> 01:32:44,582
He says the kids were all faking.
Your wife wasn't really on dope.

958
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:48,343
Doc says it was only that truth stuff.
- Sodium pentothal.

959
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,599
No harm in it at all.
- No harm?

960
01:32:51,817 --> 01:32:55,018
Schwartz is driving your car
across the border.

961
01:32:55,237 --> 01:32:59,980
I told him we'd be by the bridge.
He's bringing your wife along.

962
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:03,520
She's feeling fine.
Doc says she can travel.

963
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:07,279
Sergeant ... - Look, she just wants
to catch the early plane out of here.

964
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:11,364
How can I leave here
until my wife's name is clean?

965
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,862
What are you
carrying that microphone for?

966
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:17,740
Remember, don't cross your arms.
- I know, I know.

967
01:33:17,968 --> 01:33:20,955
I've got to get the truth
from Quinlan. On tape!

968
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:24,830
He could stay there
the rest of the week, like he used to.

969
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:28,875
Look, just take your wife home
and let me handle this. It's my job!

970
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:31,342
It's my job too, Menzies.

971
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:38,221
You think I like it? I hate
this machine, spying, creeping...

972
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:41,849
How d'you think I feel about it?
Hank is the best friend I had.

973
01:33:42,074 --> 01:33:46,224
That's one reason for my staying.
- Oh, you don't trust me?

974
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:51,031
Don't forget, I didn't have to
show you that cane.

975
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:55,364
Oh, yes you did, Sergeant.
- Somebody could've planted it there.

976
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:59,323
Besides Grandi's corpse.
- You know better than that.

977
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:02,455
You say the reefers were planted.
Why not Hank's cane?

978
01:34:02,678 --> 01:34:06,460
You're an honest cop.
- Sure I am.

979
01:34:07,307 --> 01:34:11,754
And who made me an honest cop?
Hank Quinlan. - Come on, Menzies.

980
01:34:11,978 --> 01:34:14,883
I am what I am because of him.

981
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:26,312
What's my fortune?

982
01:34:32,248 --> 01:34:34,571
You've been reading the cards, right?

983
01:34:34,959 --> 01:34:37,947
I've been doing the accounts.

984
01:34:38,588 --> 01:34:41,326
Come on, read my future for me.

985
01:34:44,968 --> 01:34:49,498
You haven't got any.
- What do you mean?

986
01:34:51,433 --> 01:34:53,507
Your future's all used up.

987
01:34:59,984 --> 01:35:02,223
Why don't you go home?

988
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:21,061
Vargas?

989
01:35:21,296 --> 01:35:26,323
I don't know if you can hear him
over that music, but I'll get him out.

990
01:35:58,082 --> 01:36:02,944
I'll get him out, away from the music.
Be sure he doesn't see you.

991
01:36:06,423 --> 01:36:08,699
I must be drunk.

992
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,168
A minute ago,

993
01:36:13,930 --> 01:36:15,506
I thought you were Vargas.

994
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:18,664
Come on out, Hank.
- What's that?

995
01:36:18,894 --> 01:36:21,763
Come on out, Hank, I'm tired.
- Who told you to come here?

996
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:25,265
I'm tired of waitin', Hank.
I've some questions you gotta answer.

997
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:30,063
Questions?

998
01:36:30,614 --> 01:36:34,681
I need another drink.
- You had enough.

999
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:38,977
That's what Tanya keeps tellin' me.
How much is enough?

1000
01:36:42,417 --> 01:36:47,694
Hank, I'm sick of chasing around...
- You could use a drink yourself.

1001
01:36:47,922 --> 01:36:51,954
You gotta answer, Hank.
First, about Vargas' gun...

1002
01:36:52,176 --> 01:36:53,539
How d'you know about that?

1003
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:58,997
He thinks you took it.
- Vargas?

1004
01:36:59,225 --> 01:37:02,130
Or was it Grandi who stole it?

1005
01:37:02,353 --> 01:37:04,462
You been talkin' to Vargas?

1006
01:37:04,689 --> 01:37:09,182
Then you took it from Grandi?
- You been gettin' kinda chummy.

1007
01:37:09,652 --> 01:37:12,010
Does that explain
that thing you're carrying?

1008
01:37:13,781 --> 01:37:16,021
What's it called,

1009
01:37:16,283 --> 01:37:18,310
that thing you're wearing?

1010
01:37:19,412 --> 01:37:22,613
What I'm wearing?
- Sure...

1011
01:37:23,082 --> 01:37:25,773
That halo.
- Halo?

1012
01:37:26,002 --> 01:37:28,490
Looks real pretty on you.

1013
01:37:30,964 --> 01:37:34,081
Soon you'll be
flappin' your wings like an angel.

1014
01:37:40,348 --> 01:37:41,591
Look out.

1015
01:37:43,226 --> 01:37:46,629
Vargas'll turn you into
one of these starry-eyed idealists.

1016
01:37:46,855 --> 01:37:49,261
They make all the real trouble.

1017
01:37:49,774 --> 01:37:53,509
They're worse than crooks. You can
always do something with a crook.

1018
01:37:53,737 --> 01:37:56,807
You're the one
that should be careful, Hank.

1019
01:37:57,032 --> 01:38:00,186
Sometimes you can be a crook, too.
Look what happened with Grandi.

1020
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:05,023
Partner,
nobody ever called me a crook.

1021
01:38:08,626 --> 01:38:11,626
Look up there.

1022
01:38:12,046 --> 01:38:13,246
See?

1023
01:38:14,965 --> 01:38:19,033
That oil pump, pumpin' up money?

1024
01:38:21,305 --> 01:38:22,703
Money...

1025
01:38:23,223 --> 01:38:27,338
Don't you think I coulda been rich?
A cop in my position?

1026
01:38:27,561 --> 01:38:29,388
What do I have?
- Tell me about Grandi.

1027
01:38:29,647 --> 01:38:34,058
After 30 years, a little turkey ranch,
that's all I got. A couple of acres.

1028
01:38:34,276 --> 01:38:36,884
We gotta talk about Grandi.

1029
01:38:39,865 --> 01:38:43,268
An honest cop.
Then this Mexican comes along,

1030
01:38:43,494 --> 01:38:47,193
and look at the spot he puts me in!
- You can't blame Vargas.

1031
01:38:50,834 --> 01:38:54,118
I blame Vargas, for everything.
- Don't be crazy!

1032
01:38:55,713 --> 01:39:00,706
I wouldn't be in a situation
where Grandi could blackmail me.

1033
01:39:00,927 --> 01:39:07,130
You must be crazy! Insane!
- Sure, sure. I'm crazy.

1034
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:12,212
You murdered Grandi. - I left my cane
by his body. That was sure crazy.

1035
01:39:12,605 --> 01:39:16,885
Let's start in the beginning.
What about Vargas' gun?

1036
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:20,975
I was talking about my cane.
- The gun! - I forgot it.

1037
01:39:21,197 --> 01:39:27,270
The gun you stole from
Vargas' briefcase! Vargas' gun!

1038
01:39:27,495 --> 01:39:29,818
All you wanna talk about is Vargas!

1039
01:39:32,542 --> 01:39:35,446
You took the gun,
but you didn't use it.

1040
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:40,412
Grandi was strangled. - Grandi was
a crook. - You're a killer, Hank.

1041
01:39:40,632 --> 01:39:43,667
Partner, I'm a cop.
- Yeah, yeah...

1042
01:39:43,885 --> 01:39:47,917
Drunk and crazy as you must've been
when you strangled him.

1043
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:52,551
I guess you were thinking
of your wife, how she was strangled.

1044
01:39:52,769 --> 01:39:58,308
I guess I'm always thinking of her,
drunk or sober.

1045
01:39:59,151 --> 01:40:05,140
What else is there to think about,
except my job, my dirty job?

1046
01:40:05,574 --> 01:40:09,985
You didn't have to make it dirty.
- It's not dirty. Look at the record.

1047
01:40:10,954 --> 01:40:14,320
Our record, partner.
- Sure, sure...

1048
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:17,196
All those convictions...

1049
01:40:17,418 --> 01:40:20,489
Convictions, sure.
How many did you frame?

1050
01:40:20,713 --> 01:40:22,241
Nobody.

1051
01:40:22,465 --> 01:40:26,709
Come on. How many did you frame?
- I told you: Nobody!

1052
01:40:26,927 --> 01:40:30,793
Nobody that wasn't guilty.

1053
01:40:31,849 --> 01:40:34,006
Guilty, guilty.

1054
01:40:35,519 --> 01:40:38,210
Every last one of 'em: Guilty.

1055
01:40:39,106 --> 01:40:41,928
All these years,
you've been playing me for a sucker.

1056
01:40:42,151 --> 01:40:45,186
Faking evidence.
- Aiding justice, partner.

1057
01:40:45,404 --> 01:40:48,854
Like the axe in the Burger case.
- Yeah, remember that?

1058
01:40:49,075 --> 01:40:51,184
I found the axe.

1059
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:56,948
Just where you planted it.
Just like the dynamite with Sanchez!

1060
01:40:57,165 --> 01:41:01,279
Don't you think that Sanchez's guilty?
He's guilty. He'll confess.

1061
01:41:02,128 --> 01:41:04,902
Hey, listen to that!

1062
01:41:07,509 --> 01:41:10,912
Hank...
- Hear that?

1063
01:41:13,223 --> 01:41:15,581
Hear what?
- An echo.

1064
01:41:26,027 --> 01:41:27,627
Vargas?

1065
01:41:31,241 --> 01:41:33,813
I feel he's someplace around here.

1066
01:41:36,121 --> 01:41:38,146
Close to me.

1067
01:41:39,248 --> 01:41:41,606
I got a hunch.
- Why Vargas? Why should he...

1068
01:41:41,834 --> 01:41:44,703
You sound nervous, Pete.

1069
01:41:47,256 --> 01:41:49,994
My old game leg...

1070
01:41:52,261 --> 01:41:55,830
...is starting to talk to me.

1071
01:41:57,182 --> 01:41:58,425
Vargas...

1072
01:42:05,983 --> 01:42:09,848
Maybe he's tailin' me with a bug.

1073
01:42:11,989 --> 01:42:13,980
Recording.

1074
01:42:16,410 --> 01:42:20,856
You carryin' a bug for him?
A microphone? Don't lie to me!

1075
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:26,357
Alright...
- Where is he? Where is he?

1076
01:42:26,586 --> 01:42:30,155
Why did you try to frame Vargas?
- Frame? Who's been framed?

1077
01:42:30,381 --> 01:42:32,289
Where is he?

1078
01:42:36,054 --> 01:42:37,664
I'm talkin' to Vargas now.

1079
01:42:39,015 --> 01:42:40,674
You hear me?

1080
01:42:40,892 --> 01:42:45,006
I'm talkin' to you, via this walking
microphone that used to work for me.

1081
01:42:45,229 --> 01:42:48,466
I ain't workin' for Vargas.
I'm working for the department.

1082
01:42:48,691 --> 01:42:53,185
Hank, give me Vargas' gun!
- OK, here it is. Vargas!

1083
01:43:49,166 --> 01:43:51,359
Well, Captain...

1084
01:43:51,585 --> 01:43:55,830
I'm afraid this is something
you can't talk your way out of.

1085
01:43:57,341 --> 01:43:59,083
You want to bet?

1086
01:44:02,722 --> 01:44:07,418
You killed him, Vargas.
- Come on, give me my gun back.

1087
01:44:09,603 --> 01:44:13,671
You don't understand me.
You killed Pete.

1088
01:44:13,899 --> 01:44:16,009
The bullet is from your gun.

1089
01:44:17,695 --> 01:44:22,520
You think anyone would believe that?
- They always believe me.

1090
01:44:22,741 --> 01:44:26,060
Anyway,
they'd never believe I killed him.

1091
01:44:26,911 --> 01:44:31,192
The gun.
- You resisting arrest?

1092
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:34,867
How could you arrest me here?
This is my country.

1093
01:44:35,628 --> 01:44:38,664
This is where you're gonna die.

1094
01:44:44,387 --> 01:44:47,374
That wasn't a miss, Vargas.
That was just to turn you around.

1095
01:44:47,599 --> 01:44:54,596
I don't wanna shoot you in the back.
Unless you'd rather try to run.

1096
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:19,663
Schwartz!

1097
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:23,034
Did you bring my wife?
- She's in the car.

1098
01:45:23,258 --> 01:45:27,373
That's Menzies. He's dead. Quinlan's
been shot too. He's lying there.

1099
01:45:27,596 --> 01:45:33,217
I've got it on tape. - You sure you
got enough? - Play it back and see.

1100
01:45:46,614 --> 01:45:50,230
All these years,
you've been playing me for a sucker.

1101
01:45:50,451 --> 01:45:55,313
Faking evidence.
- Aiding justice, partner.

1102
01:46:02,005 --> 01:46:06,368
It's all over, Susie.
I'm taking you home. Home.

1103
01:46:09,721 --> 01:46:14,214
How many did you frame?
- Nobody that wasn't guilty.

1104
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:18,928
Hank! - I ain't workin' for Vargas.
- Vargas! Vargas!

1105
01:46:19,147 --> 01:46:23,179
You better give me the gun.
- OK, there it is.

1106
01:46:26,028 --> 01:46:27,270
Pete...

1107
01:46:27,487 --> 01:46:31,270
That's the second bullet
I stopped for you.

1108
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:56,416
His intuition was right after all.
He framed that Mexican Sanchez,

1109
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:01,345
but he didn't even need to.
The kid confessed about that bomb.

1110
01:47:03,565 --> 01:47:06,599
Turns out Quinlan was right.

1111
01:47:07,443 --> 01:47:10,679
Is anybody gonna come take him away?
- Yeah, in a few minutes.

1112
01:47:12,406 --> 01:47:15,144
You really liked him, didn't you?

1113
01:47:15,368 --> 01:47:20,194
The cop did.
The one who killed him. He loved him.

1114
01:47:20,414 --> 01:47:25,691
Hank was a great detective alright.
- And a lousy cop.

1115
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,741
Is that all you have to say for him?

1116
01:47:28,965 --> 01:47:31,786
He was some kind of a man.

1117
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:38,455
What does it matter
what you say about people?

1118
01:47:44,397 --> 01:47:46,554
Goodbye, Tanya.

1119
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,800
Adios.
