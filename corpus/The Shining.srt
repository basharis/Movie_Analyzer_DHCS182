00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,942
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

2
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:17,069
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,822
His office is the first door
on the left.

4
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:24,823
Thank you.

5
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:39,633
- Mr. Ullman?
- Yes.

6
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:44,013
- I'm Jack Torrance.
- Oh, come on in, Jack.

7
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:46,766
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

8
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,934
- This is my secretary, Susie.
- Hello.

9
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,395
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?

10
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:54,440
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

11
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:56,650
That's very good time.

12
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:58,486
Sit down a minute, Jack.

13
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,446
Just make yourself at home.

14
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:01,947
Like some coffee?

15
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:04,617
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

16
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:05,826
- Susie.
- Sure.

17
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:07,787
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

18
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:12,788
Yes, I will.

19
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:22,093
Mom?

20
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,636
Yeah?

21
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:27,890
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

22
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:29,475
Sure I do.

23
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:33,270
It'll be lots of fun.

24
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:35,564
Yeah. I guess so.

25
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:40,528
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

26
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:45,529
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

27
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:48,702
Yeah, I guess so.

28
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:49,954
What about Tony?

29
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:52,873
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

30
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:55,668
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

31
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:58,504
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

32
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:00,965
I don't want to go there.

33
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:03,217
How come you don't want to go?

34
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:05,761
I just don't.

35
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:08,597
Let's just wait and see.

36
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:12,685
We're all going to have
a real good time.

37
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:15,354
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

38
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:16,981
How do you do, Bill?

39
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,150
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

40
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:21,277
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

41
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:25,656
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.

42
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:28,742
I'd like you to take him around
soon as we're through.

43
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:30,369
Fine.

44
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,079
Jack is a schoolteacher.

45
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,707
Uh, formerly a schoolteacher.

46
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,625
What line of work are you in now?

47
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:38,461
I'm a writer.

48
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:42,298
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

49
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,467
This ought to be
quite a change for you.

50
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:47,219
Well, I'm looking for a change.

51
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,015
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

52
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:53,225
...I agree with them.

53
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:55,227
Let's see, where were we?

54
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:58,063
I was about to explain...

55
00:05:58,064 --> 00:06:02,443
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

56
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:06,113
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

57
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:09,116
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?

58
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:12,786
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

59
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:15,581
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

60
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:18,792
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

61
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:20,753
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

62
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:23,297
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

63
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:26,759
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

64
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,886
...to keep it clear.

65
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:31,430
When the place was built in 1907...

66
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,225
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

67
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:39,226
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

68
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:42,066
It's certainly got plenty of that.

69
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,943
That's right.

70
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:46,987
Did they give you any idea in Denver...

71
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:48,864
...about what the job entails?

72
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:51,784
Only in a very general way.

73
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,619
Well...

74
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,247
...the winters can be fantastically cruel.

75
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:59,917
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

76
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,127
...and depreciation
which can occur.

77
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:04,755
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

78
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:08,926
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

79
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:11,804
...repairing damage as it occurs...

80
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:15,724
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

81
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:18,352
That sounds fine to me.

82
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:21,522
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

83
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:24,900
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

84
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:28,654
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

85
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:33,576
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

86
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:37,121
I'm outlining a new writing project.

87
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:41,166
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

88
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,210
That's very good, Jack.

89
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:46,589
Because, for some people...

90
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,549
...solitude...

91
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,342
...and isolation...

92
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:54,138
...can, of itself, become a problem.

93
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,265
Not for me.

94
00:07:56,266 --> 00:08:01,266
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it'?

95
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:02,688
They'll love it.

96
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,357
Great.

97
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:10,195
Well, before I turn you over to Bill...

98
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:13,907
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

99
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:15,534
Not to sound melodramatic...

100
00:08:15,535 --> 00:08:18,329
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

101
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,206
...second thoughts about the job.

102
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:23,083
I'm intrigued.

103
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,628
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

104
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:30,215
...about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

105
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:33,135
I don't believe they did.

106
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:35,137
We||....

107
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:37,389
My predecessor in this job...

108
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,643
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

109
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:44,396
He came up with his wife and
two little girls of about 8 and 10.

110
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:47,566
He had a good employment record,
good references.

111
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:50,069
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

112
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,946
...like a completely
normal individual.

113
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:55,532
But at some point during the winter...

114
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:59,370
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

115
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:04,371
He ran amuck...

116
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:08,587
...and killed his family
with an ax.

117
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:13,588
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

118
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:18,972
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

119
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:20,974
The police thought...

120
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:25,270
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

121
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:28,482
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

122
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:33,483
...when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

123
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:37,700
Wow.

124
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,326
That is...

125
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,162
...quite a story.

126
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,748
Yeah, it is.

127
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:48,377
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

128
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,295
But it did.

129
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:51,839
And, uh...

130
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,427
...I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

131
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:59,430
I certainly can.

132
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,182
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

133
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:05,644
...left it for you to tell me.

134
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:08,564
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

135
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:12,860
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

136
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:17,861
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

137
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:21,827
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

138
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:25,873
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

139
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:28,917
She's a confirmed ghost story...

140
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:33,918
...and horror film addict.

141
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:41,176
Tony, do you think Dad'|| get the job?

142
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,932
He already did.

143
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:48,933
He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

144
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:02,367
Hello.

145
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:05,245
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, hon. How's it going?

146
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:09,041
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to go through.

147
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:12,377
I don't think I can get home
before 9:00 or 10:00.

148
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,087
Sounds like you got the job.

149
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:17,007
Right. It's a beautiful place.

150
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:20,594
You and Danny are going to love it.

151
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:23,764
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

152
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:26,558
I don't know.

153
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,687
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

154
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:33,440
I don't want to.

155
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:35,943
Please.

156
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:37,402
No.

157
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:42,403
Now, Tony, tell me.

158
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:14,394
Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.

159
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:20,237
That's good. Now the other one.

160
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:25,238
Good boy.

161
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:30,873
Now, Danny...

162
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:33,125
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

163
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:36,295
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

164
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:41,296
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

165
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:46,138
No.

166
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,224
Do you remember
when you were brushing your teeth?

167
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:51,643
Yes.

168
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:56,644
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

169
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:04,364
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

170
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:08,785
Now, Danny, can you remember
what you were doing...

171
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:13,786
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

172
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,668
Talking to Tony.

173
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,880
Is Tony one of your animals?

174
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:23,133
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

175
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:25,928
Tony's his imaginary friend.

176
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:28,472
Oh.

177
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:32,643
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

178
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:34,519
No.

179
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,022
Why not?

180
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:39,608
Because he hides.

181
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:42,361
Where does he go?

182
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:46,198
To my stomach.

183
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:51,199
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

184
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:56,667
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

185
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:58,502
OK

186
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:00,712
That's fine.

187
00:14:00,713 --> 00:14:03,298
All right, Danny.

188
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:06,301
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

189
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:09,888
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

190
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,223
Do I have to?

191
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:13,684
Yes. I'd like you to.

192
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,645
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

193
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:19,189
I'll come back and check on you.

194
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,190
- Okay.
- Bye.

195
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:32,281
- Shall we go into the living room?
- Yes.

196
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:38,413
- Please.
- Thank you.

197
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:43,714
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

198
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:48,427
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

199
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:50,387
Yeah?

200
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,472
Oh.

201
00:14:52,473 --> 00:14:55,809
He seems absolutely fine now.

202
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,477
But you should've seen him.

203
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:58,729
I know.

204
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,605
Kids can scare you to death.

205
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:03,692
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

206
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:06,778
And they look much worse
than they are.

207
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,656
But what was the matter with him?

208
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:13,952
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

209
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:18,953
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

210
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,794
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

211
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:25,964
...a kind of self-induced trance.

212
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:28,842
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

213
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:32,429
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

214
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,556
No, thank you.

215
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:38,477
I'm sure you're right.

216
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:41,980
Have you been in Boulder long?

217
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:43,482
Only about three months.

218
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:48,483
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

219
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:52,908
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

220
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:54,117
Tony.

221
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:59,118
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

222
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,166
No, um....

223
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,210
Let's see....

224
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:06,004
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

225
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:09,091
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

226
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:12,260
Did he adjust well to school?

227
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:13,595
No.

228
00:16:13,596 --> 00:16:15,722
He didn't like it too much at first.

229
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:19,726
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

230
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:24,727
Yeah, I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

231
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:28,401
What sort of injury did he have?

232
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:31,029
He dislocated his shoulder.

233
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:36,030
How did he manage to do that?

234
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:40,038
It was just one of
those things, you know.

235
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,999
Purely an accident.

236
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,002
My husband had been drinking...

237
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:49,631
...and he came home
about three hours late.

238
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:54,632
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

239
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:59,891
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

240
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:04,396
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

241
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:07,691
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

242
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:10,819
...you know, in a park or in the street.

243
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,655
But on this particular occasion...

244
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:16,491
...my husband just used
too much strength...

245
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:21,492
...and he injured Danny's arm.

246
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:26,918
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said:

247
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:29,671
"Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

248
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:31,798
And if I do, you can leave me."

249
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,341
And he didn't.

250
00:17:33,342 --> 00:17:38,342
He hasn't had any alcohol in 5 months.

251
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:04,789
BOY-

252
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,790
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

253
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:14,591
Mm-hm.

254
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,384
Dad?

255
00:18:16,385 --> 00:18:18,637
Yes?

256
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:22,140
I'm hungry-

257
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:25,727
You should've eaten your breakfast.

258
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:28,813
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

259
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:31,900
Okay, Mom.

260
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:36,901
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

261
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:41,284
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

262
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:42,744
Oh.

263
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:47,123
What was the Donner party?

264
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:51,628
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

265
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:55,090
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

266
00:18:55,091 --> 00:19:00,091
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

267
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:03,515
You mean they ate each other up?

268
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:06,851
They had to in order to survive.

269
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:08,270
Jack.

270
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,562
Don't worry, Mom.

271
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:14,109
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

272
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,945
See, it's okay.

273
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:21,946
He saw it on the television.

274
00:19:50,062 --> 00:19:52,105
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8:30.

275
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:55,066
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

276
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,235
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.

277
00:19:57,236 --> 00:20:00,572
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

278
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:03,408
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

279
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,494
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

280
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:08,413
- Hi.
- Is your family having a look around?

281
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:12,000
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

282
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,294
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.

283
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,712
Oh, fine.

284
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:17,839
In view of all we have to cover today...

285
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,718
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

286
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,387
Have the Torrance's things
brought to their apartment.

287
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,765
- Fine.
- I'd better collect my family first.

288
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:31,766
Oh, yes.

289
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:38,109
This is our Colorado Lounge.

290
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,945
It's beautiful.

291
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:42,989
My God!

292
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,784
This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?

293
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:47,285
It sure is.

294
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:51,748
I've never seen anything
like this before.

295
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,917
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?

296
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:55,543
I believe they're based...

297
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:58,963
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

298
00:20:58,964 --> 00:21:01,132
They're really gorgeous.

299
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,342
As a matter of fact...

300
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:05,845
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

301
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:09,015
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

302
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:12,310
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

303
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:15,480
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

304
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:18,817
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

305
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:20,318
Lots of movie stars.

306
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,237
Royalty?

307
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:27,238
All the best people.

308
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,295
This is the staff wing of the hotel.

309
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:23,882
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

310
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:27,010
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.

311
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,387
And here are your quarters.

312
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:32,223
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

313
00:22:32,224 --> 00:22:37,224
And a small bedroom for your son.

314
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:40,231
Perfect for a child.

315
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:45,232
- Yeah.
- Yes.

316
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:51,242
Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

317
00:22:51,243 --> 00:22:55,580
Easy to keep.

318
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:56,831
Cozy.

319
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:59,334
Yes, very cozy for a family.

320
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:01,211
If you feel like spreading out...

321
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:05,507
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

322
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:08,551
Well, it's very...

323
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:10,094
...homey.

324
00:23:10,095 --> 00:23:12,764
Yeah.

325
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:15,225
This is our famous hedge maze.

326
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:19,729
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

327
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,232
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

328
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:25,068
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

329
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:29,447
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

330
00:23:29,448 --> 00:23:32,575
When was the Overlook built?

331
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:34,994
Construction started in 1907.

332
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:37,163
It was finished in 1909.

333
00:23:37,164 --> 00:23:40,041
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

334
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:41,876
They actually had to repel...

335
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:45,380
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

336
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:47,966
That's our Snowcat.

337
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:49,467
Can you both drive a car?

338
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:50,635
Yes.

339
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:54,305
That's fine. Basically
the Snowcat operates very much like a car.

340
00:23:54,306 --> 00:23:58,101
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

341
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:01,646
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

342
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:04,357
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

343
00:24:04,358 --> 00:24:07,151
Oh. He sure did a beautiful job.

344
00:24:07,152 --> 00:24:10,321
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.

345
00:24:10,322 --> 00:24:13,408
Well, this is our Gold Ballroom.

346
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:15,702
Oh, I'll say!

347
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:19,998
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

348
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:23,084
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

349
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:27,088
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

350
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:30,341
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

351
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:33,595
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

352
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:34,804
We don't drink.

353
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:36,431
Then you're in luck.

354
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:40,852
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

355
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:43,187
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

356
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:46,149
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

357
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,525
Glad to meet you.

358
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:50,612
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

359
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:54,532
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

360
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:56,618
It's just wonderful.

361
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:59,370
Hi, Danny!

362
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:01,998
I found him outside looking for you.

363
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:05,835
Dan, did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

364
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:07,211
Yeah.

365
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:08,546
Come on over here.

366
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:10,298
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Susie.

367
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:14,510
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

368
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:16,554
...while I continue on with Jack.

369
00:25:16,555 --> 00:25:19,223
It would be a pleasure. Right this way.

370
00:25:19,224 --> 00:25:20,975
Great. See you later, hon.

371
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:24,729
Bye, darling.

372
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,232
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

373
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:30,985
Now, are you a "Winnie,"
or a "Freddie"?

374
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:32,153
I'm a Wendy.

375
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:35,865
Oh, Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

376
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,700
This is the kitchen, huh?

377
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:39,494
This is it.

378
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:42,121
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

379
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:45,708
Yeah. It's the biggest place I ever seen.

380
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:48,252
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

381
00:25:48,253 --> 00:25:52,715
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

382
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:54,759
Don't let it get you down.

383
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,470
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

384
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:59,889
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

385
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,308
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

386
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:05,645
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

387
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:10,525
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

388
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:14,779
Right here is our walk-in freezer.

389
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,032
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

390
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:20,243
You got 15 rib roasts...

391
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:22,578
".30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

392
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:25,832
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

393
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:29,127
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

394
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:32,296
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

395
00:26:32,297 --> 00:26:34,132
- No.
- You don't?

396
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,925
What's your favorite food, then?

397
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:38,511
French fries and ketchup.

398
00:26:38,512 --> 00:26:40,722
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

399
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:45,723
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

400
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:49,188
Mr. Hallorann...

401
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:50,982
...how'd you know we call him Doc?

402
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:55,194
- Beg your pardon?
- Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

403
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:57,405
- I did?
- Yeah.

404
00:26:57,406 --> 00:27:00,742
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

405
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:02,201
But how did you know?

406
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:04,954
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

407
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:07,415
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

408
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:09,834
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

409
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:12,211
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

410
00:27:12,212 --> 00:27:16,716
Eh, what's up, Doc?

411
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:20,678
Now, this is the storeroom.

412
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:22,680
In here is where we keep...

413
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:25,683
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

414
00:27:25,684 --> 00:27:28,352
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

415
00:27:28,353 --> 00:27:32,356
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

416
00:27:32,357 --> 00:27:35,735
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

417
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:40,031
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

418
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:42,658
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

419
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:47,659
We got 60 boxes of dried milk....

420
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:58,382
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

421
00:27:58,383 --> 00:28:00,551
Sociables, finger rolls...

422
00:28:00,552 --> 00:28:02,303
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

423
00:28:02,304 --> 00:28:06,057
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

424
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:09,352
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

425
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:14,353
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

426
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:16,567
- Hi.
- Hi.

427
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:18,402
- How're you getting on?
- Fine.

428
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:22,156
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

429
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:24,283
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

430
00:28:24,284 --> 00:28:27,703
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

431
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:30,414
- You like ice cream, Doc?
- Yeah.

432
00:28:30,415 --> 00:28:31,582
I thought you did.

433
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:34,877
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

434
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:36,921
- Not at all.
- We don't mind.

435
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:38,756
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?

436
00:28:38,757 --> 00:28:43,757
- Yeah.
- Okay, you behave yourself.

437
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,430
What kind of ice cream do you like?

438
00:28:46,431 --> 00:28:47,640
Chocolate.

439
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:52,641
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

440
00:28:55,107 --> 00:28:57,275
It's amazing, all this activity today.

441
00:28:57,276 --> 00:29:00,278
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

442
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,946
...last day's always hectic.

443
00:29:01,947 --> 00:29:05,199
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

444
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,453
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

445
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:14,454
- Just like a ghost ship, huh?
- Yes.

446
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:22,170
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

447
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:31,722
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

448
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:39,984
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

449
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:42,737
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

450
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:47,658
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

451
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,454
She called it "shining."

452
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:54,373
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

453
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:57,627
...that had "the shine" to us.

454
00:29:57,628 --> 00:30:01,297
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

455
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:03,341
But there are other folks...

456
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:08,342
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

457
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:16,767
How long have you
been able to do it?

458
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:24,399
Why don't you want to talk about it?

459
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:30,701
I'm not supposed to.

460
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:35,702
Who says you ain't supposed to?

461
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:40,044
Tony.

462
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:44,173
Who's Tony?

463
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:49,174
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

464
00:30:49,513 --> 00:30:51,722
Is Tony the one that...

465
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:54,850
...tells you things?

466
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:57,853
Yes.

467
00:30:57,854 --> 00:31:02,066
How does he tell you things?

468
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:06,570
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

469
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:11,571
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

470
00:31:12,494 --> 00:31:17,456
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

471
00:31:17,457 --> 00:31:19,500
Yes.

472
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:22,920
Do they know he tells you things?

473
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:27,921
Tony told me never to tell them.

474
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,595
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

475
00:31:31,596 --> 00:31:36,596
About the Overlook Hotel?

476
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:39,895
I don't know.

477
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:42,440
Now think real hard, Doc.

478
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:47,028
Think.

479
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:50,698
Maybe he showed me something.

480
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:55,699
Try to think of what it was.

481
00:31:56,329 --> 00:32:01,125
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

482
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:02,752
No.

483
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:05,463
Scared of nothing here.

484
00:32:05,464 --> 00:32:07,673
It's just that...

485
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:11,343
...you know, some places
are like people.

486
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:13,262
Some shine...

487
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:15,890
...and some don't.

488
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:18,225
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...

489
00:32:18,226 --> 00:32:23,226
...has something about it
that's like shining.

490
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:29,566
Is there something bad here?

491
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:38,579
Well...

492
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,207
...you know, Doc,
when something happens...

493
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:45,628
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

494
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:47,379
Say, like...

495
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,175
...if someone burns toast.

496
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:52,551
We||....

497
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:57,552
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

498
00:32:58,391 --> 00:33:02,019
Not things that anyone can notice.

499
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:07,020
But things that people
who shine can see.

500
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:11,570
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

501
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:13,531
...well...

502
00:33:13,532 --> 00:33:18,532
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

503
00:33:19,204 --> 00:33:22,289
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

504
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:26,544
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

505
00:33:26,545 --> 00:33:31,545
And not all of them was good.

506
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:37,217
What about room 237?

507
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:41,725
Room 237?

508
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:46,564
You're scared of room 237, ain't you?

509
00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:49,567
No, I ain't.

510
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:54,568
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

511
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:56,532
Nothing.

512
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:59,952
There ain't nothing in room 237.

513
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:03,414
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

514
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:05,749
So stay out.

515
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,750
You understand? Stay out!

516
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:51,522
Good morning, hon.

517
00:35:51,523 --> 00:35:54,024
Your breakfast is ready.

518
00:35:54,025 --> 00:35:55,859
What time is it?

519
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,195
It's about 11:30.

520
00:35:58,196 --> 00:36:02,199
Eleven-thirty, Jesus.

521
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,910
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

522
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:07,663
I know it.

523
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:10,833
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

524
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:14,670
Nice.

525
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:16,672
It's really pretty outside.

526
00:36:16,673 --> 00:36:20,509
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

527
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,510
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

528
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:28,934
Any ideas yet?

529
00:36:28,935 --> 00:36:30,811
Lots of ideas.

530
00:36:30,812 --> 00:36:32,813
No good ones.

531
00:36:32,814 --> 00:36:35,774
Something will come.

532
00:36:35,775 --> 00:36:40,321
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

533
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:45,075
Yep. That's all it is.

534
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:47,786
It's really nice up here, isn't it?

535
00:36:47,787 --> 00:36:49,747
I love it.

536
00:36:49,748 --> 00:36:52,249
I really do.

537
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,461
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

538
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:59,423
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.

539
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:02,551
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

540
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:05,054
...I thought it was kind of scary.

541
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:08,265
I fell in love with it right away.

542
00:37:08,266 --> 00:37:11,435
When I came up here
for my interview...

543
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:15,481
...it was as though
I'd been here before.

544
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:18,317
I mean, we all have moments
of déjà vu...

545
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:21,278
...but this was ridiculous.

546
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:23,322
It was almost as though I knew...

547
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:26,950
...what was going to be
around every corner.

548
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:31,038
Ooh-woo-ooh.

549
00:38:00,193 --> 00:38:03,612
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?

550
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:06,365
- All right.
- And you're going to lose.

551
00:38:06,366 --> 00:38:09,660
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

552
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:15,833
Look out!

553
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:17,918
I'm coming in close.

554
00:38:17,919 --> 00:38:20,337
Loser has to keep America clean.

555
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:22,464
- Oh, no!
- Keep America clean.

556
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:25,092
Okay. Danny, you win.

557
00:38:25,093 --> 00:38:27,594
Let's take the rest of this walking.

558
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:29,972
- Okay.
- Whew.

559
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:34,017
Give me your hand.

560
00:38:34,018 --> 00:38:36,019
Isn't it beautiful?

561
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Yeah.

562
00:38:53,538 --> 00:38:58,538
Dead end.

563
00:39:51,888 --> 00:39:54,515
Woo, we made it.

564
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:59,516
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.

565
00:40:17,455 --> 00:40:19,623
It's so pretty.

566
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:23,835
Yeah.

567
00:40:23,836 --> 00:40:26,755
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

568
00:40:26,756 --> 00:40:31,756
Nope.

569
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:40,686
Rutherford was serving a life sentence...

570
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:42,646
...for a 1968 shooting.

571
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:46,733
And the search continues
for that missing Aspen woman.

572
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:50,320
<i>Twenty-four-year-old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.</i>

573
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:53,240
She disappeared on a hunting trip
with her husband.

574
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:56,243
<i>They may have to
call off the search...</i>

575
00:40:56,244 --> 00:40:58,996
...if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow.

576
00:40:58,997 --> 00:41:01,039
It's so beautiful
in Denver today...

577
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,375
...it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close.

578
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:05,836
I want to go outside
and lie in the sun...

579
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:10,173
yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.

580
00:41:10,174 --> 00:41:11,550
And it's moving...

581
00:41:11,551 --> 00:41:16,551
...right here towards Colorado
as we talk. It's incredible.

582
00:43:43,327 --> 00:43:48,327
Hi, hon.

583
00:43:48,374 --> 00:43:52,335
How's it going?

584
00:43:52,336 --> 00:43:55,630
Fine.

585
00:43:55,631 --> 00:43:59,509
Get a lot written today?

586
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,054
Yes.

587
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:08,055
Hey, the weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

588
00:44:12,023 --> 00:44:16,526
What do you want me to do about it?

589
00:44:16,527 --> 00:44:19,029
Come on, hon.

590
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,448
Don't be so grouchy.

591
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:23,158
I'm not...

592
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:24,534
...being grouchy-

593
00:44:24,535 --> 00:44:29,535
I just want to finish my work.

594
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:33,502
Okay. I understand.

595
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:36,296
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

596
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:41,297
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

597
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:43,261
Wendy...

598
00:44:43,262 --> 00:44:46,765
...let me explain something to you.

599
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:50,852
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

600
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:52,479
You're distracting me...

601
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,107
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

602
00:44:56,108 --> 00:44:59,361
Understand?

603
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,029
Yeah.

604
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,365
Fine.

605
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:05,283
We're going to make a new rule:

606
00:45:05,284 --> 00:45:06,910
Whenever I'm in here...

607
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:08,662
...and you hear me typing...

608
00:45:10,998 --> 00:45:14,125
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

609
00:45:14,126 --> 00:45:16,628
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

610
00:45:16,629 --> 00:45:19,089
That means don't come in.

611
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:24,010
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

612
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:25,971
Yeah.

613
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:28,139
Fine.

614
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,140
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

615
00:45:35,189 --> 00:45:40,189
OK.

616
00:46:07,388 --> 00:46:10,181
All right, you!

617
00:46:10,182 --> 00:46:14,102
I know you've got more.

618
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:19,103
Missed!

619
00:46:20,735 --> 00:46:21,902
Don't have!

620
00:46:21,903 --> 00:46:26,903
No fair anymore.

621
00:47:20,544 --> 00:47:25,544
Oh, no.

622
00:47:31,222 --> 00:47:36,222
I knew it.

623
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:07,753
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.

624
00:48:08,759 --> 00:48:12,679
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

625
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,182
This is KDK 1.
We're receiving you. Over.

626
00:48:16,183 --> 00:48:19,894
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

627
00:48:19,895 --> 00:48:22,939
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

628
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,482
We're just fine.

629
00:48:24,483 --> 00:48:27,152
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

630
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:30,822
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

631
00:48:30,823 --> 00:48:34,951
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

632
00:48:34,952 --> 00:48:38,329
Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.

633
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,706
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

634
00:48:39,707 --> 00:48:43,626
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

635
00:48:43,627 --> 00:48:47,505
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

636
00:48:47,506 --> 00:48:50,967
Yes. It's one of the worst
we've had for years.

637
00:48:50,968 --> 00:48:54,637
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

638
00:48:54,638 --> 00:48:57,432
I suppose not. Over.

639
00:48:57,433 --> 00:49:00,935
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

640
00:49:00,936 --> 00:49:02,437
And, Mrs. Torrance?

641
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:07,438
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.

642
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:09,152
Okay. We'll do that.

643
00:49:09,153 --> 00:49:11,446
It was real nice talking to you.

644
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:16,447
Bye. Over and out.

645
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:53,984
Hello, Danny.

646
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:01,450
Come and play with us.

647
00:50:03,749 --> 00:50:08,378
Come and play with us, Danny.

648
00:50:08,379 --> 00:50:12,006
Forever...

649
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:14,717
...and ever...

650
00:50:14,718 --> 00:50:19,718
...and ever.

651
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,837
Tony“.

652
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:55,838
...I'm scared.

653
00:50:58,345 --> 00:51:03,345
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

654
00:51:03,517 --> 00:51:07,604
It's just like pictures in a book, Danny.

655
00:51:07,605 --> 00:51:12,605
It isn't real.

656
00:51:21,243 --> 00:51:23,286
Please let me give you some money.

657
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:25,538
<i>I wouldn't think of it.</i>

658
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:27,790
Well, how can I repay you?

659
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:30,293
It's okay. Really.

660
00:51:30,294 --> 00:51:32,629
Well, I'm going to have some coffee.

661
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,882
Would you like some?

662
00:51:35,883 --> 00:51:37,133
Sure.

663
00:51:37,134 --> 00:51:42,134
Great. Sit down.

664
00:51:47,978 --> 00:51:52,978
Ooh, marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.

665
00:51:53,192 --> 00:51:57,487
- Coffee will be ready--
Mom.

666
00:51:57,488 --> 00:51:59,405
Yeah.

667
00:51:59,406 --> 00:52:04,160
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?

668
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:07,872
Not right now. Daddy's asleep.

669
00:52:07,873 --> 00:52:11,459
I won't make any noise.

670
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,544
Now come on, Doc.

671
00:52:13,545 --> 00:52:15,463
He only went to bed a few hours ago.

672
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:17,465
Can't you wait till later?

673
00:52:17,466 --> 00:52:22,466
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.

674
00:52:22,513 --> 00:52:25,306
Well, all right.

675
00:52:25,307 --> 00:52:27,892
But really don't make a sound.

676
00:52:27,893 --> 00:52:30,186
I won't, Mom.

677
00:52:30,187 --> 00:52:32,146
Make sure you come right back...

678
00:52:32,147 --> 00:52:35,024
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.

679
00:52:35,025 --> 00:52:40,025
- Okay?
- Okay, Mom.

680
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:32,036
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

681
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:38,917
Come here for a minute first.

682
00:54:13,123 --> 00:54:16,292
How's it going, Doc?

683
00:54:16,293 --> 00:54:19,504
OK.

684
00:54:19,505 --> 00:54:23,383
Having a good time?

685
00:54:23,384 --> 00:54:27,762
Yes, Dad.

686
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:31,182
Good.

687
00:54:31,183 --> 00:54:34,060
I want you to have a good time.

688
00:54:34,061 --> 00:54:39,061
lam, Dad.

689
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:44,153
Dad?

690
00:54:44,154 --> 00:54:46,155
Yes?

691
00:54:46,156 --> 00:54:50,618
Do you feel bad?

692
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:53,871
No.

693
00:54:53,872 --> 00:54:57,750
I'm just a little bit tired.

694
00:54:57,751 --> 00:55:02,751
Then why don't you go to sleep?

695
00:55:03,882 --> 00:55:06,926
I can't.

696
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:11,927
I got too much to do.

697
00:55:12,516 --> 00:55:15,685
Dad?

698
00:55:15,686 --> 00:55:18,521
Yes?

699
00:55:18,522 --> 00:55:23,522
Do you like this hotel?

700
00:55:24,153 --> 00:55:26,821
Yes.

701
00:55:26,822 --> 00:55:29,198
I do.

702
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:32,702
I love it.

703
00:55:32,703 --> 00:55:36,414
Don't you?

704
00:55:36,415 --> 00:55:40,543
I guess so.

705
00:55:40,544 --> 00:55:44,964
Good.

706
00:55:44,965 --> 00:55:49,965
I want you to like it here.

707
00:55:51,263 --> 00:55:54,891
I wish we could stay here forever...

708
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:57,351
...and ever...

709
00:55:57,352 --> 00:56:01,105
...and ever.

710
00:56:01,106 --> 00:56:04,108
Dad?

711
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:06,402
What?

712
00:56:06,403 --> 00:56:11,403
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

713
00:56:14,995 --> 00:56:19,995
What do you mean?

714
00:56:21,585 --> 00:56:24,879
Did your mother ever say that to you?

715
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,423
That I would hurt you?

716
00:56:27,424 --> 00:56:30,968
No, Dad.

717
00:56:30,969 --> 00:56:33,095
You sure?

718
00:56:33,096 --> 00:56:38,096
Yes, Dad.

719
00:56:39,436 --> 00:56:42,688
I love you, Danny.

720
00:56:42,689 --> 00:56:45,483
I love you more than anything else...

721
00:56:45,484 --> 00:56:48,819
...in the whole world...

722
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,198
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

723
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:54,283
...never.

724
00:56:54,284 --> 00:56:56,536
You know that, don't you?

725
00:56:56,537 --> 00:56:59,330
- Hm?
- Yes, Dad.

726
00:56:59,331 --> 00:57:04,331
Good.

727
00:57:41,915 --> 00:57:46,915
Mom?

728
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:06,143
Mom?

729
00:58:28,378 --> 00:58:33,378
Mom, are you in there?

730
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,071
Jack!

731
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:42,072
Jack? Jack!

732
00:59:44,037 --> 00:59:49,037
Jack!

733
00:59:49,376 --> 00:59:50,626
What happened?

734
00:59:50,627 --> 00:59:52,753
Honey...

735
00:59:52,754 --> 00:59:55,005
...what's wrong?

736
00:59:55,006 --> 01:00:00,006
Jack?

737
01:00:02,305 --> 01:00:03,931
I had the most...

738
01:00:03,932 --> 01:00:08,477
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

739
01:00:08,478 --> 01:00:12,606
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It's okay, it's okay now.

740
01:00:12,607 --> 01:00:17,607
Really.

741
01:00:18,238 --> 01:00:20,030
I dreamed that I...

742
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:25,031
...that I killed you and Danny.

743
01:00:25,245 --> 01:00:28,789
But | didn't just kill you.

744
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:33,790
I cut you up into little pieces.

745
01:00:34,212 --> 01:00:36,464
My God.

746
01:00:36,465 --> 01:00:41,302
I must be losing my mind.

747
01:00:41,303 --> 01:00:46,015
Everything's going to be all right.

748
01:00:46,016 --> 01:00:51,016
Come on. Let's get up off the floor.

749
01:00:55,609 --> 01:00:59,528
It's okay. There. Now sit up.

750
01:00:59,529 --> 01:01:01,906
It's okay.

751
01:01:01,907 --> 01:01:06,907
It's okay.

752
01:01:07,412 --> 01:01:08,913
Danny!

753
01:01:08,914 --> 01:01:11,040
Everything's okay!

754
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:14,543
Just go play in your room for a while.

755
01:01:14,544 --> 01:01:17,922
Your dad's just got a headache.

756
01:01:17,923 --> 01:01:22,923
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

757
01:01:22,928 --> 01:01:26,055
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

758
01:01:26,056 --> 01:01:28,015
I'll be right back.

759
01:01:28,016 --> 01:01:29,517
Danny.

760
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:33,145
Why don't you mind me?

761
01:01:33,146 --> 01:01:38,146
Oh, Danny.

762
01:01:38,193 --> 01:01:41,237
Oh, my God.

763
01:01:41,238 --> 01:01:44,406
What happened to your neck?

764
01:01:44,407 --> 01:01:48,202
Danny, what happened to your neck?

765
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:53,203
Huh?

766
01:02:16,648 --> 01:02:19,066
You did this to him...

767
01:02:19,067 --> 01:02:22,319
...didn't you?!

768
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,613
You son of a bitch!

769
01:02:24,614 --> 01:02:26,657
You did this to him!

770
01:02:26,658 --> 01:02:29,451
Didn't you?!

771
01:02:29,452 --> 01:02:31,328
How could you?!

772
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:36,329
How could you?!

773
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:45,630
Oh.

774
01:04:02,921 --> 01:04:07,921
God! I'd give anything for a drink.

775
01:04:08,677 --> 01:04:11,762
I'd give my goddamn soul...

776
01:04:11,763 --> 01:04:16,763
...for just a glass of beer.

777
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:34,239
Hi, Lloyd.

778
01:04:34,285 --> 01:04:39,285
A little slow tonight, isn't it?

779
01:04:41,584 --> 01:04:45,921
Yes, it is, Mr. Torrance.

780
01:04:45,922 --> 01:04:49,049
What Will it be?

781
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:52,219
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

782
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:55,764
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

783
01:04:55,765 --> 01:04:58,851
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

784
01:04:58,852 --> 01:05:02,813
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.

785
01:05:02,814 --> 01:05:04,940
So here's what:

786
01:05:04,941 --> 01:05:07,443
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

787
01:05:07,444 --> 01:05:10,446
...a little glass and some ice.

788
01:05:10,447 --> 01:05:12,948
You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?

789
01:05:12,949 --> 01:05:15,868
You're not too busy, are you?

790
01:05:15,869 --> 01:05:18,871
No, sir. I'm not busy at all.

791
01:05:18,872 --> 01:05:20,748
Good man.

792
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:22,124
You set them up...

793
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:26,128
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

794
01:05:26,129 --> 01:05:29,256
White man's burden, Lloyd, my man.

795
01:05:29,257 --> 01:05:34,257
White man's burden.

796
01:05:37,474 --> 01:05:38,807
say, Lloyd...

797
01:05:38,808 --> 01:05:41,935
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

798
01:05:41,936 --> 01:05:44,646
How's my credit in this joint, anyway?

799
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:47,691
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

800
01:05:47,692 --> 01:05:49,526
That's swell.

801
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:51,445
I like you, Lloyd.

802
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:53,322
I always liked you.

803
01:05:53,323 --> 01:05:55,824
You were always the best of them.

804
01:05:55,825 --> 01:05:58,410
Best goddamned bartender...

805
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:01,538
...from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.

806
01:06:01,539 --> 01:06:04,041
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.

807
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:08,253
Thank you for saying so.

808
01:06:08,254 --> 01:06:13,008
Here's to five miserable months
on the wagon...

809
01:06:13,009 --> 01:06:18,009
...and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.

810
01:06:35,281 --> 01:06:39,076
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?

811
01:06:39,077 --> 01:06:43,205
Things could be better.

812
01:06:43,206 --> 01:06:46,834
Things could be
a whole lot better.

813
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:49,461
I hope it's nothing serious.

814
01:06:49,462 --> 01:06:52,172
No.

815
01:06:52,173 --> 01:06:55,801
Nothing serious.

816
01:06:55,802 --> 01:06:58,554
Just a little problem with...

817
01:06:58,555 --> 01:07:01,890
...the old sperm bank upstairs.

818
01:07:01,891 --> 01:07:04,476
Nothing I can't handle, though.

819
01:07:04,477 --> 01:07:06,645
Thanks.

820
01:07:06,646 --> 01:07:07,855
Women.

821
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:09,565
Can't live with them...

822
01:07:09,566 --> 01:07:14,566
...can't live without them.

823
01:07:14,612 --> 01:07:16,405
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

824
01:07:16,406 --> 01:07:18,073
Words of...

825
01:07:18,074 --> 01:07:23,074
...wisdom.

826
01:07:31,087 --> 01:07:34,548
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

827
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:38,218
I didn't.

828
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:43,219
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

829
01:07:43,433 --> 01:07:48,145
I love the little son of a bitch.

830
01:07:48,146 --> 01:07:51,190
I'd do anything for him.

831
01:07:51,191 --> 01:07:56,191
Any fucking thing for him.

832
01:07:58,072 --> 01:08:01,617
But that bitch!

833
01:08:01,618 --> 01:08:03,619
As long as I live...

834
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:08,620
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

835
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:19,801
I did hurt him once, okay?

836
01:08:19,802 --> 01:08:22,179
It was an accident.

837
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:26,058
Completely unintentional.

838
01:08:26,059 --> 01:08:30,020
It could have happened to anybody.

839
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:33,690
And it was three goddamn years ago!

840
01:08:33,691 --> 01:08:36,735
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

841
01:08:36,736 --> 01:08:41,736
All I tried to do was pull him up.

842
01:08:41,991 --> 01:08:46,991
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

843
01:08:46,996 --> 01:08:48,747
I mean...

844
01:08:48,748 --> 01:08:52,501
...a few extra foot-pounds of energy...

845
01:08:52,502 --> 01:08:57,502
...per second, per second.

846
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:04,801
Jack!

847
01:09:09,686 --> 01:09:11,436
Oh, Jack.

848
01:09:11,437 --> 01:09:15,107
Thank God you're here.

849
01:09:15,108 --> 01:09:16,566
Jack.

850
01:09:16,567 --> 01:09:18,986
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

851
01:09:18,987 --> 01:09:21,697
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

852
01:09:21,698 --> 01:09:26,698
She tried to strangle Danny.

853
01:09:26,828 --> 01:09:29,496
Are you out of your fucking mind?

854
01:09:29,497 --> 01:09:31,164
No.

855
01:09:31,165 --> 01:09:32,874
It's the truth! Really.

856
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:35,711
I swear it. Danny told me.

857
01:09:35,712 --> 01:09:37,796
He went up into one of the bedrooms.

858
01:09:37,797 --> 01:09:41,466
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

859
01:09:41,467 --> 01:09:46,467
She tried to strangle him!

860
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:52,185
Which room was it?

861
01:09:56,899 --> 01:09:59,234
From Channel 10 in Miami...

862
01:09:59,235 --> 01:10:01,820
...this is Newswatch
with Glenn Rinker...

863
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:06,366
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.

864
01:10:06,367 --> 01:10:08,994
<i>Good evening. I'm Glenn Rinker,
News-watch Ten.</i>

865
01:10:08,995 --> 01:10:12,331
<i>As Miami continues to swelter
in</i> a <i>record winter heat wave...</i>

866
01:10:12,332 --> 01:10:14,666
...bringing temperatures to the 90s...

867
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:18,003
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.

868
01:10:18,004 --> 01:10:22,215
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell in just a few hours tonight.

869
01:10:22,216 --> 01:10:24,634
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.

870
01:10:24,635 --> 01:10:27,804
<i>Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.</i>

871
01:10:27,805 --> 01:10:29,931
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.

872
01:10:29,932 --> 01:10:31,892
Railroad tracks are frozen.

873
01:10:31,893 --> 01:10:34,102
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch. ..

874
01:10:34,103 --> 01:10:37,898
<i>... at least three have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.</i>

875
01:10:37,899 --> 01:10:40,400
The governor of Colorado is expected...

876
01:10:40,401 --> 01:10:42,319
...to declare a weather emergency.

877
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,363
The National Guard
might be called out...

878
01:10:44,364 --> 01:10:45,781
...to clear streets and roads.

879
01:10:45,782 --> 01:10:48,200
Weather forecasters
predict more snow...

880
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:50,410
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...

881
01:10:50,411 --> 01:10:53,246
...with temperatures dropping
well below zero.

882
01:10:53,247 --> 01:10:56,458
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.

883
01:10:56,459 --> 01:10:58,877
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.

884
01:10:58,878 --> 01:11:01,046
Local beaches should be jammed.

885
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:03,298
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...

886
01:11:03,299 --> 01:11:06,718
<i>... will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.</i>

887
01:16:39,135 --> 01:16:43,304
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

888
01:16:43,305 --> 01:16:48,305
<i>If you need assistance,
please call the operator.</i>

889
01:17:02,032 --> 01:17:03,700
Jack?

890
01:17:03,701 --> 01:17:05,744
Yes, it's me.

891
01:17:05,745 --> 01:17:10,745
Thank God.

892
01:17:11,834 --> 01:17:13,835
Did you find anything?

893
01:17:13,836 --> 01:17:17,172
No. Nothing at all.

894
01:17:17,173 --> 01:17:22,173
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

895
01:17:23,053 --> 01:17:26,765
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

896
01:17:26,766 --> 01:17:28,808
Yes, I did.

897
01:17:28,809 --> 01:17:30,810
And you didn't see anything at all?

898
01:17:30,811 --> 01:17:33,021
Absolutely nothing.

899
01:17:33,022 --> 01:17:34,481
How is he?

900
01:17:34,482 --> 01:17:36,691
He's still asleep.

901
01:17:36,692 --> 01:17:41,692
Good.

902
01:17:43,616 --> 01:17:48,616
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

903
01:17:51,207 --> 01:17:53,875
Are you sure it was the right room?

904
01:17:53,876 --> 01:17:57,253
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

905
01:17:57,254 --> 01:17:59,839
He must have gone in that room.

906
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:04,840
The door was open,
the lights were on.

907
01:18:05,137 --> 01:18:10,137
I just don't understand it.

908
01:18:11,811 --> 01:18:16,811
What about those bruises on his neck?

909
01:18:17,024 --> 01:18:22,024
Somebody did that to him.

910
01:18:27,618 --> 01:18:30,745
I think...

911
01:18:30,746 --> 01:18:35,746
...he did it to himself.

912
01:18:39,296 --> 01:18:41,214
No.

913
01:18:41,215 --> 01:18:45,760
That's not possible.

914
01:18:45,761 --> 01:18:48,555
Wendy...

915
01:18:48,556 --> 01:18:52,433
...once you rule out his version
of what happened...

916
01:18:52,434 --> 01:18:55,520
...there is no other explanation.

917
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:59,232
Is there?

918
01:18:59,233 --> 01:19:02,318
It wouldn't be that different
from the episode...

919
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:05,905
...that he had before
we came up here.

920
01:19:05,906 --> 01:19:09,450
Would it?

921
01:19:12,621 --> 01:19:15,039
Oh, Jack.

922
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:20,040
Whatever the explanation is...

923
01:19:21,463 --> 01:19:23,089
<i>... I think we...</i>

924
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:28,090
...have to get Danny out of here.

925
01:19:30,598 --> 01:19:34,017
Get him out of here?

926
01:19:34,018 --> 01:19:36,603
Yes.

927
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:39,355
You mean...

928
01:19:39,356 --> 01:19:42,358
...just leave the hotel?

929
01:19:42,359 --> 01:19:47,359
Yes.

930
01:19:50,326 --> 01:19:51,910
It is so...

931
01:19:51,911 --> 01:19:54,537
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...

932
01:19:54,538 --> 01:19:57,290
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

933
01:19:57,291 --> 01:20:00,043
When I'm really into my work!

934
01:20:00,044 --> 01:20:04,213
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't I?

935
01:20:04,214 --> 01:20:08,176
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash.

936
01:20:08,177 --> 01:20:10,428
- Any of that appeal to you?
- Jack".

937
01:20:10,429 --> 01:20:14,349
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

938
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:19,350
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.

939
01:21:35,931 --> 01:21:37,890
Good evening. Forest Service.

940
01:21:37,891 --> 01:21:40,435
Hello, my name is Dick Hallorann.

941
01:21:40,436 --> 01:21:43,062
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.

942
01:21:43,063 --> 01:21:45,398
Good evening.
What can I do for you?

943
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:49,152
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

944
01:21:49,153 --> 01:21:52,655
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

945
01:21:52,656 --> 01:21:56,451
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

946
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:59,328
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

947
01:21:59,329 --> 01:22:02,790
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

948
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:04,625
And with this storm
and everything...

949
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:07,754
...I'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

950
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:10,256
...just to see if everything's okay.

951
01:22:10,257 --> 01:22:11,758
I'll be glad to do that.

952
01:22:11,759 --> 01:22:14,761
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

953
01:22:14,762 --> 01:22:16,971
<i>Thank you very much.
I'll do that.</i>

954
01:22:16,972 --> 01:22:19,307
All right, sir.

955
01:22:38,744 --> 01:22:40,912
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

956
01:22:40,913 --> 01:22:45,913
Good evening.

957
01:23:06,939 --> 01:23:08,606
Hi, Lloyd.

958
01:23:08,607 --> 01:23:10,733
Been away, but now I'm back.

959
01:23:10,734 --> 01:23:13,152
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

960
01:23:13,153 --> 01:23:14,362
It's good to see you.

961
01:23:14,363 --> 01:23:17,657
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

962
01:23:17,658 --> 01:23:20,201
What'|| it be, sir?

963
01:23:20,202 --> 01:23:23,871
Hair of the dog that bit me.

964
01:23:23,872 --> 01:23:26,374
Bourbon on the rocks.

965
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:31,375
That'll do her.

966
01:23:41,265 --> 01:23:44,976
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

967
01:23:44,977 --> 01:23:47,562
No charge?

968
01:23:47,563 --> 01:23:52,563
Your money's no good here.

969
01:23:55,237 --> 01:24:00,158
Orders from the house.

970
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:05,159
Orders from the house.

971
01:24:05,914 --> 01:24:10,084
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

972
01:24:10,085 --> 01:24:15,085
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

973
01:24:16,925 --> 01:24:20,094
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

974
01:24:20,095 --> 01:24:25,095
At least, not at this point.

975
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:29,645
Anything you say, Lloyd.

976
01:24:29,646 --> 01:24:34,646
Anything you say.

977
01:24:43,452 --> 01:24:44,619
Oh!

978
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:47,371
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

979
01:24:47,372 --> 01:24:49,874
- Oh.
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

980
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:52,418
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

981
01:24:52,419 --> 01:24:57,419
Oh, that's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

982
01:24:57,507 --> 01:25:00,509
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

983
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:01,844
Advocaat, is it?

984
01:25:01,845 --> 01:25:04,222
Yes, sir. I think the best thing...

985
01:25:04,223 --> 01:25:06,641
...is to come along
to the gentleman's room...

986
01:25:06,642 --> 01:25:09,977
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

987
01:25:09,978 --> 01:25:13,481
Looks like you might have got a
spot of it on yourself...

988
01:25:13,482 --> 01:25:14,690
...Jeevesy old boy.

989
01:25:14,691 --> 01:25:18,152
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

990
01:25:18,153 --> 01:25:20,988
Awfully nice of you to say.

991
01:25:20,989 --> 01:25:24,075
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

992
01:25:24,076 --> 01:25:26,535
...before the fish and goose soiree.

993
01:25:26,536 --> 01:25:28,788
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

994
01:25:28,789 --> 01:25:31,082
Here. I'll just...

995
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:33,542
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

996
01:25:33,543 --> 01:25:36,379
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

997
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:40,216
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.

998
01:25:40,217 --> 01:25:41,676
All right. I'll just...

999
01:25:41,677 --> 01:25:46,472
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

1000
01:25:46,473 --> 01:25:48,099
Won't keep you a moment.

1001
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:52,561
Fine.

1002
01:25:52,562 --> 01:25:54,438
What do they call you, Jeevesy?

1003
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:59,439
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

1004
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:02,947
Grady?

1005
01:26:02,948 --> 01:26:05,324
Yes, sir.

1006
01:26:05,325 --> 01:26:06,867
Delbert Grady.

1007
01:26:06,868 --> 01:26:11,868
That's right, sir.

1008
01:26:14,334 --> 01:26:17,086
Uh....

1009
01:26:17,087 --> 01:26:19,297
Mr. Grady...

1010
01:26:19,298 --> 01:26:21,590
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

1011
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:26,591
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

1012
01:26:31,351 --> 01:26:34,353
It's coming off now, sir.

1013
01:26:34,354 --> 01:26:38,107
Uh...

1014
01:26:38,108 --> 01:26:41,193
...Mr. Grady...

1015
01:26:41,194 --> 01:26:43,863
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?

1016
01:26:43,864 --> 01:26:48,864
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

1017
01:26:49,703 --> 01:26:53,247
You a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?

1018
01:26:53,248 --> 01:26:54,457
Yes, sir.

1019
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:58,586
I have a wife and two daughters, sir.

1020
01:26:58,587 --> 01:27:01,756
And...

1021
01:27:01,757 --> 01:27:03,257
...where are they now?

1022
01:27:03,258 --> 01:27:08,258
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

1023
01:27:15,437 --> 01:27:17,980
Mr. Grady.

1024
01:27:17,981 --> 01:27:21,859
You were the caretaker here.

1025
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:25,237
I recognize you.

1026
01:27:25,238 --> 01:27:28,741
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

1027
01:27:28,742 --> 01:27:30,951
You...

1028
01:27:30,952 --> 01:27:34,997
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

1029
01:27:34,998 --> 01:27:37,041
And...

1030
01:27:37,042 --> 01:27:42,042
...then you blew your brains out.

1031
01:27:48,887 --> 01:27:51,639
That's strange, sir.

1032
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:56,640
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

1033
01:27:58,063 --> 01:28:00,356
Mr. Grady...

1034
01:28:00,357 --> 01:28:05,357
...you were the caretaker here.

1035
01:28:11,493 --> 01:28:16,163
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

1036
01:28:16,164 --> 01:28:18,624
But you...

1037
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:22,711
...are the caretaker.

1038
01:28:22,712 --> 01:28:27,712
You've always been the caretaker.

1039
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:31,804
I should know, sir.

1040
01:28:31,805 --> 01:28:36,805
I've always been here.

1041
01:28:52,617 --> 01:28:55,035
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

1042
01:28:55,036 --> 01:28:57,204
...that your son...

1043
01:28:57,205 --> 01:29:00,124
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...

1044
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:04,879
...into this situation?

1045
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:09,880
Did you know that?

1046
01:29:10,385 --> 01:29:12,845
No.

1047
01:29:12,846 --> 01:29:17,266
He is, Mr. Torrance.

1048
01:29:17,267 --> 01:29:20,686
Who?

1049
01:29:20,687 --> 01:29:25,687
A nigger.

1050
01:29:26,401 --> 01:29:30,529
A nigger?

1051
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:32,156
A nigger...

1052
01:29:32,157 --> 01:29:37,157
.“cook.

1053
01:29:39,748 --> 01:29:43,292
How?

1054
01:29:43,293 --> 01:29:45,503
Your son...

1055
01:29:45,504 --> 01:29:49,256
...has a very great talent.

1056
01:29:49,257 --> 01:29:53,511
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

1057
01:29:53,512 --> 01:29:56,931
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...

1058
01:29:56,932 --> 01:30:01,932
...against your will.

1059
01:30:07,442 --> 01:30:11,487
Well...

1060
01:30:11,488 --> 01:30:16,488
...he is a very willful boy.

1061
01:30:16,952 --> 01:30:19,578
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

1062
01:30:19,579 --> 01:30:22,665
A very willful boy.

1063
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:24,208
A rather...

1064
01:30:24,209 --> 01:30:25,960
...naughty boy...

1065
01:30:25,961 --> 01:30:30,961
...if I may be so bold, sir.

1066
01:30:36,388 --> 01:30:40,307
It's his mother.

1067
01:30:40,308 --> 01:30:41,976
She...

1068
01:30:41,977 --> 01:30:46,977
...interferes.

1069
01:30:47,065 --> 01:30:50,359
Perhaps they need a good...

1070
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,403
...talking-to.

1071
01:30:52,404 --> 01:30:53,612
If...

1072
01:30:53,613 --> 01:30:56,991
...you don't mind my saying so.

1073
01:30:56,992 --> 01:30:59,159
Perhaps...

1074
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:04,081
...a bit more.

1075
01:31:04,082 --> 01:31:05,499
My girls, sir...

1076
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:10,004
...they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

1077
01:31:10,005 --> 01:31:14,091
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

1078
01:31:14,092 --> 01:31:17,845
...and tried to burn it down.

1079
01:31:17,846 --> 01:31:19,680
But I...

1080
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:23,017
...corrected them, sir.

1081
01:31:23,018 --> 01:31:27,354
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

1082
01:31:27,355 --> 01:31:29,607
I--

1083
01:31:29,608 --> 01:31:34,608
...corrected her.

1084
01:31:45,915 --> 01:31:50,915
We have the Snowcat.

1085
01:31:51,254 --> 01:31:53,213
If the weather breaks...

1086
01:31:53,214 --> 01:31:55,215
...we might just be able...

1087
01:31:55,216 --> 01:31:58,135
...to get down the mountain.

1088
01:31:59,929 --> 01:32:03,098
I could call
the forest rangers first...

1089
01:32:03,099 --> 01:32:04,725
...and...

1090
01:32:04,726 --> 01:32:06,977
...tell them that we're coming...

1091
01:32:06,978 --> 01:32:08,354
...so that...

1092
01:32:08,355 --> 01:32:13,355
...they could start searching
for us in case we didn't make it.

1093
01:32:16,237 --> 01:32:20,866
And if Jack won't come with us...

1094
01:32:20,867 --> 01:32:24,787
...I'll just have to tell him that
we're going by ourselves.

1095
01:32:24,788 --> 01:32:28,123
That's all there is to it.

1096
01:32:28,124 --> 01:32:30,584
Redrum.

1097
01:32:30,585 --> 01:32:32,419
<i>Re drum.</i>

1098
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:36,757
<i>Re drum. Redrum.</i>

1099
01:32:36,758 --> 01:32:38,592
- Danny?
- Redrum.

1100
01:32:38,593 --> 01:32:42,513
<i>Re drum. Redrum.</i>

1101
01:32:42,514 --> 01:32:44,848
- Redrum.
- What's the matter, hon?

1102
01:32:44,849 --> 01:32:46,016
<i>Re drum!</i>

1103
01:32:46,017 --> 01:32:49,770
Are you having a bad dream?

1104
01:32:49,771 --> 01:32:53,982
Danny?

1105
01:32:53,983 --> 01:32:58,983
Hon?

1106
01:33:01,032 --> 01:33:06,032
Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.

1107
01:33:09,958 --> 01:33:12,459
Come on, hon.

1108
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,795
Wake up.

1109
01:33:14,796 --> 01:33:18,465
You just had a bad dream.

1110
01:33:18,466 --> 01:33:23,466
Everything's okay.

1111
01:33:24,681 --> 01:33:29,681
Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.

1112
01:33:35,567 --> 01:33:38,026
Danny.

1113
01:33:38,027 --> 01:33:40,988
Wake up!

1114
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:42,531
Come on.

1115
01:33:42,532 --> 01:33:44,533
Right now.

1116
01:33:44,534 --> 01:33:49,534
Wake up!

1117
01:33:49,956 --> 01:33:54,956
Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.

1118
01:33:56,838 --> 01:34:01,838
Danny.

1119
01:34:03,845 --> 01:34:04,261

Are you receiv--

1134
01:35:12,413 --> 01:35:14,498
Good evening. Forest service.

1135
01:35:14,499 --> 01:35:16,917
This is Dick Hallorann again.

1136
01:35:16,918 --> 01:35:20,212
I called a while ago about
the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

1137
01:35:20,213 --> 01:35:21,380
Oh, yeah.

1138
01:35:21,381 --> 01:35:25,259
We tried to contact them several
times but they didn't answer.

1139
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:29,096
Maybe they got their radio
turned off or they can't hear it.

1140
01:35:29,097 --> 01:35:32,474
If you'd like, I'd be glad
to try again later on.

1141
01:35:32,475 --> 01:35:34,810
That's very nice of you.

1142
01:35:34,811 --> 01:35:36,770
I'll call you back later.

1143
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:41,771
Bye.

1144
01:36:24,903 --> 01:36:28,155
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?

1145
01:36:28,156 --> 01:36:30,490
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.

1146
01:36:30,491 --> 01:36:35,491
Thank you very much.

1147
01:37:35,932 --> 01:37:37,140
Durkin's Garage.

1148
01:37:37,141 --> 01:37:38,433
Can I speak to Larry?

1149
01:37:38,434 --> 01:37:39,726
Speaking.

1150
01:37:39,727 --> 01:37:42,521
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.

1151
01:37:42,522 --> 01:37:44,398
Dick! How you doing?

1152
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:45,941
How's the weather down there?

1153
01:37:45,942 --> 01:37:49,486
I'm not in Florida.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.

1154
01:37:49,487 --> 01:37:51,530
What are you doing there?

1155
01:37:51,531 --> 01:37:55,158
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.

1156
01:37:55,159 --> 01:37:57,411
What's the weather like there?

1157
01:37:57,412 --> 01:38:00,497
The snowplows are keeping things
moving in town...

1158
01:38:00,498 --> 01:38:02,958
...but the mountain roads
are blocked.

1159
01:38:02,959 --> 01:38:05,877
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat
to get up there.

1160
01:38:05,878 --> 01:38:07,921
Can you fix me up with one?

1161
01:38:07,922 --> 01:38:10,215
What's the big deal
about getting there today...

1162
01:38:10,216 --> 01:38:12,634
“especially in this weather?

1163
01:38:12,635 --> 01:38:16,304
Larry, just between you and me,
we got a very serious problem...

1164
01:38:16,305 --> 01:38:18,765
...with the people taking care
of the place.

1165
01:38:18,766 --> 01:38:22,811
They turned out to be
completely unreliable assholes.

1166
01:38:22,812 --> 01:38:24,813
Ullman phoned me last night.

1167
01:38:24,814 --> 01:38:29,651
And I'm supposed to find out
if they have to be replaced.

1168
01:38:29,652 --> 01:38:32,029
How long will it take you
to get here?

1169
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:33,905
About five hours.

1170
01:38:33,906 --> 01:38:36,616
I'm going to rent a car
here at the airport.

1171
01:38:36,617 --> 01:38:38,577
Okay, I'll take care of it.

1172
01:38:38,578 --> 01:38:41,621
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.

1173
01:38:41,622 --> 01:38:44,875
That's all right. Drive carefully.

1174
01:38:49,922 --> 01:38:53,383
You're with Hal and Charlie
on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.

1175
01:38:53,384 --> 01:38:56,136
And we have a bad day out there.

1176
01:38:56,137 --> 01:38:59,723
Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.

1177
01:38:59,724 --> 01:39:01,433
Many mountain passes...

1178
01:39:01,434 --> 01:39:04,478
Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...

1179
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:07,981
<i>... and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.</i>

1180
01:39:07,982 --> 01:39:09,858
We hear from the news department...

1181
01:39:09,859 --> 01:39:13,278
<i>... only</i> a <i>few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...</i>

1182
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:15,072
...and with storms like this...

1183
01:39:15,073 --> 01:39:18,617
...I guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.

1184
01:39:18,618 --> 01:39:22,454
The storm will continue through
the day and the Weather Service...

1185
01:39:22,455 --> 01:39:25,123
...has declared a stockman's
and traveler's advisory...

1186
01:39:25,124 --> 01:39:28,126
...for all areas outlying
the Denver metro region.

1187
01:39:28,127 --> 01:39:31,171
Get the cows in the barn.

1188
01:39:50,983 --> 01:39:55,983
Hon?

1189
01:39:57,031 --> 01:40:02,031
Listen to me for a minute, will you?

1190
01:40:03,246 --> 01:40:07,165
I'm just going to go and
talk to Daddy for a few minutes...

1191
01:40:07,166 --> 01:40:10,168
...and I'll be right back.

1192
01:40:10,169 --> 01:40:12,879
I want you to just stay here...

1193
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:17,880
...and watch your cartoons, okay?

1194
01:40:18,511 --> 01:40:23,265
Okay, hon?

1195
01:40:23,266 --> 01:40:28,266
Yes, Mrs. Torrance.

1196
01:40:34,902 --> 01:40:36,987
All right.

1197
01:40:36,988 --> 01:40:41,908
I'll-- I'll be back
in just about five minutes.

1198
01:40:41,909 --> 01:40:46,909
I'm going to lock the door
behind me.

1199
01:41:33,169 --> 01:41:38,169
Jack?

1200
01:41:55,566 --> 01:42:00,566
Jack?

1201
01:44:10,576 --> 01:44:11,743
How do you like it?

1202
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:18,875
Jack.

1203
01:44:18,876 --> 01:44:23,876
How do you like it?

1204
01:44:30,346 --> 01:44:35,346
What are you doing down here?

1205
01:44:37,395 --> 01:44:40,188
I just...

1206
01:44:40,189 --> 01:44:41,648
...wanted...

1207
01:44:41,649 --> 01:44:45,777
...to talk to you.

1208
01:44:45,778 --> 01:44:47,654
OK.

1209
01:44:47,655 --> 01:44:52,655
Let's talk.

1210
01:44:58,916 --> 01:45:03,916
What do you want to talk about?

1211
01:45:06,924 --> 01:45:08,842
I--

1212
01:45:08,843 --> 01:45:12,804
I can't really remember.

1213
01:45:12,805 --> 01:45:15,723
You can't remember.

1214
01:45:15,724 --> 01:45:17,434
No...

1215
01:45:17,435 --> 01:45:22,435
...I can't.

1216
01:45:24,150 --> 01:45:29,150
Maybe it was about Danny?

1217
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:34,780
Maybe it was about him.

1218
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:41,120
I think we should discuss Danny.

1219
01:45:42,209 --> 01:45:44,419
I think...

1220
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:49,420
...we should discuss
what should be done with him.

1221
01:45:52,887 --> 01:45:57,887
What should be done with him?

1222
01:46:00,478 --> 01:46:02,770
I don't know.

1223
01:46:02,771 --> 01:46:04,981
I don't think that's true.

1224
01:46:04,982 --> 01:46:07,775
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

1225
01:46:07,776 --> 01:46:09,694
...about what should be done
with Danny.

1226
01:46:09,695 --> 01:46:14,199
And I'd like to know
what they are.

1227
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,284
Well, I...

1228
01:46:16,285 --> 01:46:20,914
...I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

1229
01:46:20,915 --> 01:46:24,417
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1230
01:46:24,418 --> 01:46:26,419
Yes.

1231
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:30,423
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1232
01:46:30,424 --> 01:46:32,383
As soon as possible?

1233
01:46:32,384 --> 01:46:37,384
"As soon as possible?"

1234
01:46:37,389 --> 01:46:40,225
Please.

1235
01:46:40,226 --> 01:46:45,063
You believe his health
might be at stake.

1236
01:46:45,064 --> 01:46:47,941
Yes.

1237
01:46:47,942 --> 01:46:50,777
And you are concerned about him.

1238
01:46:50,778 --> 01:46:53,112
Yes.

1239
01:46:53,113 --> 01:46:56,199
And are you concerned about me?

1240
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:57,575
Of course I am.

1241
01:46:57,576 --> 01:46:59,994
Of course you are!

1242
01:46:59,995 --> 01:47:03,331
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

1243
01:47:03,332 --> 01:47:05,041
What are you talking about?

1244
01:47:05,042 --> 01:47:08,086
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

1245
01:47:08,087 --> 01:47:10,338
...thought about
my responsibilities?

1246
01:47:10,339 --> 01:47:12,799
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

1247
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,885
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

1248
01:47:15,886 --> 01:47:17,929
Has it ever occurred to you...

1249
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:21,641
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1st?

1250
01:47:21,642 --> 01:47:23,893
Does it matter to you at all...

1251
01:47:23,894 --> 01:47:27,188
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

1252
01:47:27,189 --> 01:47:30,525
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

1253
01:47:30,526 --> 01:47:33,611
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

1254
01:47:33,612 --> 01:47:35,822
Do you have the slightest idea...

1255
01:47:35,823 --> 01:47:39,450
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!

1256
01:47:39,451 --> 01:47:42,745
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

1257
01:47:42,746 --> 01:47:45,331
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

1258
01:47:45,332 --> 01:47:47,834
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it'?!

1259
01:47:47,835 --> 01:47:50,253
Stay away from me!

1260
01:47:50,254 --> 01:47:51,629
Why?

1261
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:54,799
I just want to go back to my room.

1262
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,551
Why?

1263
01:47:56,552 --> 01:47:58,678
Well...

1264
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:01,848
...I'm very confused.

1265
01:48:01,849 --> 01:48:06,561
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

1266
01:48:06,562 --> 01:48:10,690
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

1267
01:48:10,691 --> 01:48:14,444
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

1268
01:48:14,445 --> 01:48:16,279
Stay away from me!

1269
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:18,364
Please!

1270
01:48:18,365 --> 01:48:19,616
Don't hurt me.

1271
01:48:19,617 --> 01:48:21,159
I'm not going to hurt you.

1272
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,327
Stay away from me!

1273
01:48:22,328 --> 01:48:23,620
- Wendy.
- Stay away!

1274
01:48:23,621 --> 01:48:24,829
Darling.

1275
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:26,831
Light of my life.

1276
01:48:26,832 --> 01:48:28,374
I'm not going to hurt you.

1277
01:48:28,375 --> 01:48:30,543
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

1278
01:48:30,544 --> 01:48:32,962
I said, "I'm not going to hurt you."

1279
01:48:32,963 --> 01:48:36,007
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

1280
01:48:36,008 --> 01:48:40,053
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

1281
01:48:40,054 --> 01:48:42,096
Stay away from me!

1282
01:48:42,097 --> 01:48:43,348
Don't hurt me!

1283
01:48:43,349 --> 01:48:46,017
I'm not going to hurt you.

1284
01:48:46,018 --> 01:48:47,769
Stay away from me!

1285
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:49,729
Stay away!

1286
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:51,981
Please!

1287
01:48:51,982 --> 01:48:53,941
Stop swinging the bat.

1288
01:48:53,942 --> 01:48:55,985
Stay away from me.

1289
01:48:55,986 --> 01:48:57,487
Put that bat down, Wendy.

1290
01:48:57,488 --> 01:48:59,155
Stop it!

1291
01:48:59,156 --> 01:49:00,448
Wendy.

1292
01:49:00,449 --> 01:49:01,783
Give me the bat.

1293
01:49:01,784 --> 01:49:03,159
Please!

1294
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:05,578
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

1295
01:49:05,579 --> 01:49:06,871
Stop it!

1296
01:49:06,872 --> 01:49:08,623
- Give me the bat.
- Jack.

1297
01:49:08,624 --> 01:49:10,458
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.

1298
01:49:10,459 --> 01:49:12,043
Please stop!

1299
01:49:12,044 --> 01:49:13,419
Give me the bat.

1300
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:14,921
- Stay away from me.
- Wendy.

1301
01:49:14,922 --> 01:49:16,589
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.

1302
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:18,174
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

1303
01:49:18,175 --> 01:49:23,175
Ah! Goddamn--!

1304
01:50:35,002 --> 01:50:37,503
What are you doing?

1305
01:50:37,504 --> 01:50:39,505
Hey.

1306
01:50:39,506 --> 01:50:42,383
Wait a minute.

1307
01:50:42,384 --> 01:50:47,221
What are you doing?

1308
01:50:47,222 --> 01:50:52,222
What are you doing?

1309
01:50:54,188 --> 01:50:59,188
Uh! Oh!

1310
01:51:02,362 --> 01:51:04,197
Wait a minute!

1311
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:08,034
What are you doing?

1312
01:51:08,035 --> 01:51:11,078
Open the door!

1313
01:51:11,079 --> 01:51:12,330
Goddamn it!

1314
01:51:12,331 --> 01:51:17,331
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

1315
01:51:19,588 --> 01:51:21,255
Wendy, listen.

1316
01:51:21,256 --> 01:51:24,383
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

1317
01:51:24,384 --> 01:51:29,384
It'll be just like nothing ever happened.

1318
01:51:40,192 --> 01:51:44,111
Wendy, baby.

1319
01:51:44,112 --> 01:51:49,033
I think you hurt my head real bad.

1320
01:51:49,034 --> 01:51:51,702
I'm dizzy.

1321
01:51:51,703 --> 01:51:56,703
I need a doctor.

1322
01:52:00,754 --> 01:52:04,632
Honey.

1323
01:52:04,633 --> 01:52:09,633
Don't leave me in here.

1324
01:52:15,602 --> 01:52:20,565
I'm going to go now.

1325
01:52:20,566 --> 01:52:22,608
I'm going to try...

1326
01:52:22,609 --> 01:52:26,279
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

1327
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:30,908
...in the Snowcat today.

1328
01:52:30,909 --> 01:52:34,537
I'll bring back a doctor.

1329
01:52:34,538 --> 01:52:38,124
Wendy.

1330
01:52:38,125 --> 01:52:40,960
I'm going to go now.

1331
01:52:40,961 --> 01:52:44,881
Wendy.

1332
01:52:44,882 --> 01:52:47,425
Yes.

1333
01:52:47,426 --> 01:52:52,426
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

1334
01:52:52,681 --> 01:52:56,976
You're not going anywhere.

1335
01:52:56,977 --> 01:53:01,272
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

1336
01:53:05,694 --> 01:53:09,530
Go check it out.

1337
01:53:09,531 --> 01:53:14,531
Go check it out!

1338
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:20,120
Go check it out.

1339
01:55:02,019 --> 01:55:05,062
Wendy?

1340
01:55:05,063 --> 01:55:08,190
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

1341
01:55:08,191 --> 01:55:11,736
Delbert Grady.

1342
01:55:11,737 --> 01:55:16,737
Grady?

1343
01:55:18,118 --> 01:55:23,118
Oh, Grady.

1344
01:55:24,374 --> 01:55:29,374
Grady, uh....

1345
01:55:33,675 --> 01:55:38,675
Hello, Grady.

1346
01:55:40,182 --> 01:55:43,934
Mr. Torrance...

1347
01:55:43,935 --> 01:55:48,397
...I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

1348
01:55:48,398 --> 01:55:53,398
...business we discussed.

1349
01:55:57,616 --> 01:56:01,410
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

1350
01:56:01,411 --> 01:56:06,332
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

1351
01:56:06,333 --> 01:56:09,585
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

1352
01:56:09,586 --> 01:56:12,588
I wonder.

1353
01:56:12,589 --> 01:56:15,883
I have my doubts.

1354
01:56:15,884 --> 01:56:20,346
I, and others, have come to believe...

1355
01:56:20,347 --> 01:56:23,974
...that your heart is not in this.

1356
01:56:23,975 --> 01:56:28,975
That you haven't the belly for it.

1357
01:56:32,692 --> 01:56:37,692
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

1358
01:56:37,823 --> 01:56:41,283
That's all I ask.

1359
01:56:41,284 --> 01:56:45,746
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

1360
01:56:45,747 --> 01:56:47,414
Somewhat more...

1361
01:56:47,415 --> 01:56:49,667
"resourceful.

1362
01:56:49,668 --> 01:56:54,668
She seems to have got
the better of you.

1363
01:56:55,674 --> 01:56:59,051
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

1364
01:56:59,052 --> 01:57:03,139
Only for the moment.

1365
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:07,560
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

1366
01:57:07,561 --> 01:57:11,814
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

1367
01:57:11,815 --> 01:57:13,649
I fear...

1368
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:18,650
...that is the only thing to do.

1369
01:57:19,698 --> 01:57:21,991
There's nothing I look forward to...

1370
01:57:21,992 --> 01:57:26,992
...with greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.

1371
01:57:27,289 --> 01:57:31,500
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

1372
01:57:31,501 --> 01:57:36,501
I give you my word.

1373
01:58:45,659 --> 01:58:49,161

1374
01:58:49,162 --> 01:58:52,998

1411
02:01:56,516 --> 02:02:01,516
Wendy, I'm home.

1412
02:02:36,848 --> 02:02:41,848
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1413
02:03:03,833 --> 02:03:05,250
Danny...

1414
02:03:05,251 --> 02:03:07,920
...I can't get out.

1415
02:03:07,921 --> 02:03:09,922
Run!

1416
02:03:09,923 --> 02:03:11,882
Run and hide!

1417
02:03:11,883 --> 02:03:13,217
Run!

1418
02:03:13,218 --> 02:03:16,136
Quick!

1419
02:03:16,137 --> 02:03:21,137
Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in.

1420
02:03:26,439 --> 02:03:31,360
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

1421
02:03:31,361 --> 02:03:33,612
Then I'll huff...

1422
02:03:33,613 --> 02:03:35,739
...and I'll puff...

1423
02:03:35,740 --> 02:03:39,284
...and I'll blow your house in!

1424
02:03:52,715 --> 02:03:54,800
Please!

1425
02:03:54,801 --> 02:03:57,261
Don't!

1426
02:03:57,262 --> 02:04:02,262
Don't!

1427
02:04:17,365 --> 02:04:22,365
Stop it!

1428
02:04:22,829 --> 02:04:27,829
Here's Johnny!

1429
02:04:31,671 --> 02:04:36,671
Ah!

1430
02:07:06,492 --> 02:07:11,492
Hello?

1431
02:07:13,166 --> 02:07:18,166
Anybody here?

1432
02:07:26,637 --> 02:07:30,307
Hello?

1433
02:07:30,308 --> 02:07:35,308
Anybody here?

1434
02:07:37,023 --> 02:07:42,023
Hello?

1435
02:07:50,912 --> 02:07:55,912
Anybody here?

1436
02:08:04,842 --> 02:08:09,842
Hello?

1437
02:08:20,316 --> 02:08:22,734
Hello?

1438
02:08:22,735 --> 02:08:27,735
Anybody here?

1439
02:09:03,109 --> 02:09:05,652
Danny!

1440
02:09:05,653 --> 02:09:10,653
Danny-boy!

1441
02:09:10,950 --> 02:09:15,287
Danny?

1442
02:09:15,288 --> 02:09:17,914
Danny.

1443
02:09:17,915 --> 02:09:22,915
Danny.

1444
02:09:25,798 --> 02:09:29,134
Danny?

1445
02:10:53,386 --> 02:10:58,386
Danny!

1446
02:11:00,393 --> 02:11:03,395

1448
02:11:42,601 --> 02:11:47,601
Danny!

1449
02:11:48,190 --> 02:11:52,610
I'm coming!

1450
02:11:52,611 --> 02:11:57,611
I'm coming, Dan!

1451
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:18,340
Danny?

1452
02:12:55,341 --> 02:13:00,341
Great party, isn't it'?

1453
02:13:07,228 --> 02:13:12,228
Danny!

1454
02:13:13,067 --> 02:13:15,401
Danny!

1455
02:13:15,402 --> 02:13:20,198
I'm coming!

1456
02:13:20,199 --> 02:13:25,199
You can't get away!

1457
02:13:26,372 --> 02:13:31,372
I'm right behind you!

1458
02:14:23,137 --> 02:14:28,137

1459
02:15:44,343 --> 02:15:49,343
Danny!

1460
02:17:24,943 --> 02:17:27,236
Danny!

1461
02:17:27,237 --> 02:17:30,448
- Mommy!
- Danny, come here!

1462
02:17:30,449 --> 02:17:35,449
Mommy.

1463
02:17:37,790 --> 02:17:40,541
Danny!

1464
02:17:40,542 --> 02:17:45,542
Where...?
