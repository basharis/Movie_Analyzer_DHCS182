00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:24,691
Hello, my name is Marty
Di Bergi. I'm a filmmaker.

2
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,485
I make a lot of commercials.

3
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,030
That little dog that chases the
covered wagon underneath the sink?

4
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:32,115
That was mine.

5
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,995
In 1966, I went down to
Greenwich Village, New York City,

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,998
to a rock club called
The Electric Banana.

7
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,376
Don't look for it,
it's not there anymore.

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,965
But that night, I heard a band that for
me redefined the word "rock 'n' roll."

9
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:55,430
I remember being knocked out by
their exuberance, their raw power

10
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,432
and their punctuality.

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,436
That band was Britain's
now legendary Spinal Tap.

12
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,940
Seventeen years
and 15 albums later,

13
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,818
Spinal Tap is
still going strong.

14
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,571
And they've earned a
distinguished place in rock history

15
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,198
as one of
England's loudest bands.

16
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,577
So, in the late fall of 1982,

17
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:21,831
when I heard that Tap was releasing
a new album called Smell the Glove,

18
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,126
and was planning their first tour of
the United States in almost six years

19
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,586
to promote that album,

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,423
well, needless to say, I jumped at
the chance to make the documentary,

21
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:34,510
the, if you will, rockumentary
that you are about to see.

22
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:40,057
I wanted to capture the
sights, the sounds, the smells

23
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,519
of a hard-working
rock band on the road.

24
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,521
And I got that.

25
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,732
But I got more.

26
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,609
A lot more.

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,403
But, hey,
enough of my yakking.

28
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,197
What do you say?
Let's boogie.

29
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,209
Gives me a lot of energy,
makes me happy.

30
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,252
Heavy metal is deep.
You can get stuff out of it.

31
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,296
The way they dress.
The leather.

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,131
Which one is this?
Is this LaGuardia...

33
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,966
No, this is JFK.

34
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,593
Oh, yes.
New York, New York.

35
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,766
Watch it now.
Watch it now!

37
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,072
It's like you become one
with the guys in the band.

38
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,867
I mean, there's no division,
you just...

39
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:45,957
The music just unites
people with the players.

40

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

54
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,210
Let's talk a little bit about
the history of the group.

55
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:17,173
I understand, Nigel, you and
David originally started the band

56
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,759
back in, when was it, 1964?

57
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,469
Before that, we were
in different groups.

58
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,930
I was in a group called The
Creatures, which was a skiffle group.

59
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,056
I was in Lovely Lads.

60
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,266
And then we
looked at each other

61
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,561
and said, well,
we might as well join up.

62
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,481
So we became The Originals. Right.

63
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,192
And we had to change
our name, actually.

64
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,028
Well, there was another group in
the East End called The Originals.

65
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,447
You know, we had to
rename ourselves.

66
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,074
New Originals.
New Originals.

67
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,368
And then they became...
The Regulars.

68
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,953
They changed their name
back to The Regulars.

69
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,539
We thought, well, we could go back to
The Originals, but what's the point?

70
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,000
Then we became The
Thamesmen at that point.

71

00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,549

out and tell you everything?

MARTY: What happened to him?

84
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,928
He died. He died in a bizarre
gardening accident some years back.

85
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,681
It's really one of
those things. It was...

86
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:54,145
The authorities said best
leave it unsolved, really.

87
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,355
And he was replaced by...

was he choked on vomit.

He passed away.

96
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,127
It was actually
someone else's vomit.

97

different world that they're in.

they get all they want,

00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,676
so they don't really understand
about a life like Frank's.

and lost the way Frank has,

what life's about.

something. NIGEL: Really?

173
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,728
DAVID: The New York Times?
The New York Times.

174
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,606
The bump we've got to iron out here
is when do we get the album released?

175
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,108
I mean, it doesn't matter how good
the press is or what the stringers...

176
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,902
IAN: As I explained
last night,

177
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,072
we're not gonna saturate
the New York market.

178
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,324
Now, Philly, now that's
a real rock 'n' roll town.

179
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,575
DAVID: Oh,
Philly's a great town.

180
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,869
Be assured that the
album will be available

181
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,413
all through the Philadelphia
metropolitan area.

182
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,915
DAVID: So you are
hitting that market.

183
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,918
We're certainly doing...

184
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,254
I'm doing everything I can.

185
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,588
You know that
we're not blaming you.

186
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,091
But you don't feel that these
guys have an effect on an audience.

187
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,010
I mean, kids go to their
concert, they have a great time...

188
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,389
But it's a passing thing.
It's...

189
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:04,687
I mean, I would never tell
them this, but this is a fad.

190
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,855
(PLAYING BIG BOTTOM)

191
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,110
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

192
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:30,546
(SINGING) The bigger the
cushion, the sweeter the pushin'

193
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,048
That's what I said

194
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,971
The looser the waistband,
the deeper the quicksand

195
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,307
Or so I have read

196
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:48,147
My baby fits me
like a flesh tuxedo

197
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,734
I like to sink her
with my pink torpedo

198
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,280
Big bottom, big bottom

199
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:00,367
Talk about bum cakes,
my girl's got 'em

200
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,413
Big bottom,
drive me out of my mind

201
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,292
How could I leave this behind?

202
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,343
I met her on Monday

203
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,511
It was my lucky bun day

204
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,930
You know what I mean

205
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,684
I love her each weekday

206
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,145
Each velvety cheek day

207
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,647
You know what I mean

208
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,487
My love gun's loaded
and she's in my sights

209
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,908
Big game is waiting there
inside her tights, yeah!

210
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,870
Big bottom, big bottom

211
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:49,041
Talk about mud flaps,
my girl's got 'em

212
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,920
Big bottom,
drive me out of my mind

213
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:57,132
How could I leave this behind?

214
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,976
Let's talk about your
reviews a little bit.

215
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,603
Regarding
Intravenus de Milo,

216
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,189
"This tasteless cover
is a good indication

217
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,775
"of the lack of
musical invention within.

218
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,320
"The musical growth rate of
this band cannot even be charted.

219
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,408
"They're treading water in a sea of
retarded sexuality and bad poetry."

220
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,951
That's nitpicking,
isn't it?

221
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,370
MARTY: The Gospel
According To Spinal Tap.

222
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,748
"This pretentious, ponderous
collection of religious rock psalms

223
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,126
"is enough to prompt
the question,

224
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,170
"'What day did
the Lord create Spinal Tap,

225
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,173
"'and couldn't he have
rested on that day, too?"'

226
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,218
I never heard that one. That's
a good one. That's a good one.

227
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,636
The review you had
on Shark Sandwich,

228
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,764
which was merely
a two-word review,

229
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,225
it just said,
"Shit sandwich."

230
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,726
(CHUCKLING)

231
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,437
DEREK: Where'd they print
that? Who printed that?

232
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,188
That's not real, is it?
DEREK: You can't print that.

233
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,317
DAVID: You know, all those arguments
about touring or not touring,

234
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,778
and all that, I mean, it's
obvious, we belong on tour.

235
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,864
You know, it's a great idea.
MARTY: I couldn't agree more.

236
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,115
You know all that stuff
about you being too old

237
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,324
and you being too white...
DEREK: Yeah.

238
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,618
But what about
the album, Ian?

239
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,744
Well, that's
the real problem...

240
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,246
There's beginning
to be a refrain here.

241
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,623
You know, there's no way to promote
something that doesn't exist,

242
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,083
you know?

243
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,626
It's a very
unimportant reason.

244
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,546
It's just that they're just
experimenting with a...

245
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,381
With some new
packaging materials.

246
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,757
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Right, let me get the door.

247
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,801
What kind of experimenting? They
got monkeys opening it or what?

248
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,971
The other thing is that the
Boston gig has been canceled.

249
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,055
DAVID: What?
Yeah.

250
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,641
I wouldn't worry about it, though,
it's not a big college town.

251
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,439
Hey, I heard you boys had an
album coming out right now?

252
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,941
DAVID: Yeah, it's Smell the
Glove. It should be out now...

253
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,194
Smell the Glove?
Smell the Glove, yeah.

254
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,696
It's a provocative title.
I love it.

255
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,364
Wait till you see the cover,
wait till you see the cover.

256
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,908
Very provocative indeed.

257
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,869
IAN: Bobbi, can I tear
you away from all this?

258
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,497
Do you have a drink?

259
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,373
No, I don't...
I don't really need one.

260
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,001
But, listen, I really do
have to talk to you a bit

261
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,336
about this whole
issue of the...

262
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,505
Ian, just tell me
whatever's on your mind.

263
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,131
The issue of the cover.

264
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,966
Yeah?
Um...

265
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:07,137
We... I mean, we feel,
and it seems to be facts,

266
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,640
that the company is rather down
on the cover. Is that the case?

267
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,725
Yes. You can give it to
me straight, you know.

268
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,852
Listen, they don't
like the cover.

269
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,437
They don't like the cover.
That's certainly straight.

270
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,106
They find it very offensive
and very sexist.

271
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,733
Well, what exactly
do you find offensive?

272
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,029
Ian, you put a greased, naked
woman... I mean, what's offensive?

273
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,447
...on all fours...
Yes.

274
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,533
...with a dog collar around
her neck... With a dog collar.

275
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,117
...and a leash...
And a leash.

276
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,119
...and a man's arm,
extended out,

277
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,455
up to here,
holding on to the leash

278
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,292
and pushing a black glove
in her face to sniff it.

279
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,044
You don't find that
offensive? No, I don't.

280
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,212
You don't find that sexist?

281
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,672
This is 1982, Bobbi,
come on.

282
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,049
That's right, it's 1982.
Get out of the '60s.

283
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,426
We don't have this mentality
anymore. Listen to me.

284
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,928
Well, you should've seen
the cover they wanted to do.

285
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,388
I don't care... It wasn't
a glove, believe me.

286
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,472
See, now this is
something, Ian,

287
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,182
that you're going to have
to talk to your boys about.

288
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,767
We're certainly not
laying down any conditions.

289
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,394
And I don't think
a sexy cover is the answer

290
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,062
for why an album sells
or doesn't sell.

291
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,399
Because, you tell me, The
White Album, what was that?

292
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,984
There was nothing on
that goddamn cover.

293
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,110
(PHONE RINGING)

294
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,653
Excuse me, the phone's ringing. Sure.

295
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,904
Ian, we'll talk
about this after.

296
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,072
Okay, right, love.

297
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,448
Hello?

298
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,950
Hi, Denis.

299
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,202
Uh-oh.

300
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,621
Okay. Why don't you tell him?

301
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,540
Okay, hold on one minute.

302
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,708
Ian?

303
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,751
It's Eaton-Hogg.
He wants to talk to you.

304
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:20,836
Okay. Thank you, darling.

305
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,713
You're welcome, dear.

306
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,966
Hello, Sir Denis?

307
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,843
Hi, how are you?

308
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,014
Oh!

309
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,183
Fucking old poofter!

310
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,771
But it's really not that
offensive, Sir Denis, come on.

311
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,526
Okay. I'll call you absolutely
first thing in the morning.

312
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,904
Oh, shit!

313
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,616
They're not going
to release the album,

314
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,869
because they have decided
that the cover is sexist.

315
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,912
NIGEL: Well, so what?
DEREK: Yeah.

316
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,956
What's wrong with being sexy?
I mean, there's no...

317
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,625
Sexist!
"Ist."

318
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,627
They wanted sexy. Okay, listen,
I wanted to tell you this,

319
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,211
and I was holding back,

320
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,797
because I didn't know what
Denis' decision was going to be.

321
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,634
But, at this point, both
Sears and Kmart stores have

322
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,218
refused to
handle the album.

323
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,929
They're boycotting the album
only because of the cover.

324
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,014
If the first album
was a hit...

325
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,098
If a company's
behind an album,

326
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,225
it can shove it
right down their throats.

327
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,728
Money talks and
bullshit walks.

328
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,605
And if the first
album was a hit,

329
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,981
then we could've
pressed on them,

330
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,316
then we could've told them,

331
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,776
"Yes, let's..."
The music, every cut,

332
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,819
on this album is a hit. I don't
give a shit what the album...

333
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,863
It's a matter of
compromise. It was a joke.

334
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,074
And they're making it a big deal.
Yeah, that's it. That's true.

335
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,367
You know, if we were
serious, and we said,

336
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,328
"Yes, she should be forced
to smell the glove,"

337
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,997
then you'd have a point, you know,
but it's all a joke, isn't it?

338
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,999
I mean, it's making fun...
Well, it is and it isn't.

339
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,167
We're making fun of
that sort of thing.

340
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,669
She should be made
to smell it, you know?

341
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,671
DAVID: Not, you know, over
and over again, of course.

342
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,506
Listen, the thing is, we can
probably work something out.

343
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,342
I'll talk to Denis and maybe we
can come up with a compromise.

344
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,844
A new design concept
that we can all live with.

345
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,221
You guys were schoolmates?

346
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,225
We don't... We're not
university material.

347
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,143
What's that on your finger?
It's my gum.

348
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,478
What are you doing
with it on your finger?

349
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,355
I might need it later.

350
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,941
Put it on the table,
that's terrible.

351
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,651
I might forget
it on the table.

352
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,445
How old were you guys when you
met? I can't take him anywhere.

353
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,865
NIGEL: About eight years old.
Eight or nine.

354
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,618
DAVID: You were eight
and I was seven.

355
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,786
That's right, yeah.

356
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,790
MARTY: Do you remember the first song
that you guys ever wrote together?

357
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,709
All The Way Home,
probably.

358
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,751
Yeah.
All The Way Home?

359
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,546
Yeah. Can you remember
a little bit of it?

360
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,965
I'd love to hear it.
Christ.

361
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,550
With some black coffee
maybe we could do it.

362
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:32,884
How does it go?

363
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,261

train to bring you back

If she's not on the 5:19, then
I'm gonna know what sorrow means

370
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,282
And I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
All the way home

371
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,535

372
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,996

(CLEARING THROAT)

374
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,916
Cry, cry, cry
all the way home...

375
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,128
It's fairly simple. It's about six
words in the whole song, you know.

376
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,921
We just repeat them over
and over again. Yeah.

377
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,965
Let's talk about
your music today.

378
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:17,137
One thing that puzzles me is
the make-up of your audience

379
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,433
seems to be, predominantly,
young boys.

380
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,935
Well, it's
a sexual thing, really.

381
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,772
Aside from the identifying
that boys do with us,

382
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,900
there's also like
a reaction to the female...

383
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,651
Of the female to our music.

384
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,819
What was the way... Yeah.

385
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,237
Really, they're
quite fearful.

386
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,322
That's my theory.

387
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,158
They see us on stage,
with tight trousers.

388
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,869
We've got, you know,
armadillos in our trousers.

389
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,121
I mean, it's really quite
frightening, the size.

390
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,581
Yeah.

391
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,957
And they run screaming.

392
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,084
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

393
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,173
Ian, can I have a word
with you for a minute?

394
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,466
Yes, of course.

395
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,469
Listen, we have problems...

396
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,678
What?

397
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,806
...with the arrangements
backstage.

398
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,141
What exactly?
What, I mean...

399
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,893
Well, no, there's
some problems here.

400
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,144
I don't even know
where to start.

401
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:09,022
All right, this... No,
no, no. Sound check? What?

402
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,400
This, this... Look, there's
a little problem with the...

403
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,319
Look, this miniature bread,

404
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,448
it's, like, I've been working with
this now for about half an hour.

405
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,827
I can't figure out... Let's
say I want a bite, right?

406
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,328
I got this...
You'd like bigger bread?

407
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,955
Exactly. I don't
understand how...

408
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,456
You could just
fold this, though.

409
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,625
Well, no, then it's half the
size. I mean, you could fold it.

410
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,502
No, not the bread.
You just fold the meat.

411
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,337
Yeah, but then
it breaks apart.

412
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,421
No, no, no.

413
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,048
You put it on the bread
like this, see?

414
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,467
But then if you keep folding
it, it keeps breaking...

415
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,052
But why would you
keep folding it?

416
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,514
...and everything has to be
folded, and then it's this.

417
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,433
And I don't want this,
I want large bread,

418
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,310
so that I can put this...

419
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,520
Right.

420
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,147
...so then it's like this.
But this doesn't work,

421
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,649
because then it's all...

422
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,067
Because it hangs out
like that.

423
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,194
Look, would you be
holding this?

424
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,029
No, I wouldn't want to
put that in my mouth.

425
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,240
All right, A. Exhibit A.
No, you're right.

426
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,827
And then we move onto this.
Look. Who's in here? No one.

427
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,538
And then in here,
there's a little guy. Look.

428
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,123
So it's a complete
catastrophe!

429
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,332
No, you're right.
Nigel, Nigel...

430
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,001
But calm down. Calm down.

431
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,210
Calm... No, it's no big deal.

432
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,795

I'm sorry.

No, it's a joke.
No, I really...

435
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,217
I don't want it to affect
your performance. All right?

436
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,094
It's not going to
affect my performance.

437
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,929
Don't worry about it,
all right?

438
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,055
I just hate it, really.

439
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,307
It does disturb me.
It won't happen again.

440
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,475
But I'll rise above it,
I'm a professional.

play all these, or...

Well, I play them
and I cherish them.

450
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,478
This is at the top of the heap, right
here. There's no question about it.

451
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,940
Look at the flame on that
one. I mean, it's just...

452
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,817
It's quite unbelievable.

just listen for a minute.

I'm not hearing anything.

457
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,164
You would, though,
if it were playing,

458
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,084
because it really is
famous for its sustain.

459
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,335

So I strap this piece on, right
down in here when I'm on stage.

469

It's a wireless.
Wireless, exactly.

And I can play without
all the mucky-muck.

Well, don't point, even.
Don't even point?

No. It can't be
played. Never.

00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,714
No, you've seen
enough of that one.

This is a top to what we use
on stage, but it's very special,

Yeah.

Look, right across
the board, 11, 11, 11...

485
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,854
And most of these
amps go up to 10.

00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,938
Exactly.

487
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,399
Does that mean it's louder?
Is it any louder?

488
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:24,652
Well, it's one louder,
isn't it? It's not 10.

489
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,697
You see, most blokes
will be playing at 10.

490
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,950
You're on 10 here, all
the way up, all the way up,

00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:34,996
you're on 10 on your guitar,
where can you go from there? Where?

492
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,831
I don't know.
Nowhere. Exactly!

00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,833
What we do is,
if we need that

494
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,711
extra push over the cliff,
you know what we do?

495
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,172
Put it up to 11.
11! Exactly. One louder.

496
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,926
Why don't you just make 10 louder,
and make 10 be the top number,

497
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,220
and make that
a little louder?

498
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,807
These go to 11.

00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,609
You wanted
seven suites, yes.

505
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,693
Seven suites.

506
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,947
He mistakenly put you on the
seventh floor, with one suite.

507
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,282
That's considerably
more than minor.

508
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:15,286
But it's a good size room, sir, it's
a King Leisure. We can get you...

509
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,790
How are we gonna get 14 people
in a King Leisure bed, Tucker?

510
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,792
Don't tempt me, sir. Have a
good time, will you? Take care.

511
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,918
I'll take care of it.

512
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,295
You're welcome, gentlemen. And
very attractive, they are, too.

513
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,839
Listen to me!
Yes, sir.

514
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,841
We want these suites, and
we want them now, okay?

515
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,259
These people are tired.
Yes, we can help you.

516
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,302
We have sound check in an hour.
Reba! Perhaps you can help us.

517
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,720
What's the problem, sir?
Give me a hand, please.

518
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,389
What's the matter? I'll
tell you what's wrong, okay?

519
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,350
This twisted old
fruit here tells me

520
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,977
that you have not
got my reservations.

521
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,145
I'm just as God made me, sir.

522
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,438
What's the difference between
golf and miniature golf?

523
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,232
I think the balls...
The holes are smaller.

524
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,484
Uh-oh! Look out,
here they come.

525
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,986
Duke, Duke!

(GIGGLING)

527
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,822
Can I have your autograph?

528
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,990
DAVID: It's Duke Fame!
It's Duke Fame.

529
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,992
Duke! Duke.

530
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,702
It's okay, we know him.

531
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,163
David St. Hubbins,
Spinal Tap.

532
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,123
Derek Smalls, Spinal Tap.
Nigel...

533
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,207
We gotta get going...

534
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,625
Listen, where are
you playing in town?

535
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,627
You playing here?
We're doing the...

536
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,504
Enormodome, whatever
it is, it's terrific.

537
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,298
Yeah, big place, outside of
town. Sold it out. Very nice.

538
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,674
That's a big place.
You sold it out?

539
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,967
What's that?
20,000 seats?

540
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,844
We really should run,
you know...

541
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,555
Good heavens!
How are you, Laddy?

542
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,307
Great to see you, Ter.

543
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,058
Terrific to see you.
Liam!

544
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,935
Ian. Ian.
Ian, yeah.

545
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,104
Listen, we'd love to
stand around and chat,

546
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,690
but we gotta sit down in the
lobby and wait for the limo.

547
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,817
Okay. Duke, great to see you.
Catch up with you on the road.

548
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,569
Great to see you again,
Terry. Yeah, cheers!

549
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,653
Best of luck.
NIGEL: Duke!

550
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,738
DEREK: We'll catch up
at your house, maybe.

551
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,781
NIGEL: Great! Great!
Great to see you.

552
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,658
See you. See you, Duke.
Good days, good days.

553
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,703
Wanker.
NIGEL: What a wanker.

554
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,913
What a wanker.
DEREK: No-talent sod.

555
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,290
He's got this much talent.
This much, if he's lucky.

556
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,416
DEREK: We carried him.

557
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,043
We had to apologize
for him with our set.

558
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,169
That's right.

559
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,254
People were still
booing him when we went on.

560
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,048
It's all bull.
It's all hype.

561
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,342
We got our rooms.
Big fat suites.

562
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,551
Can I ask you something?

563
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,429
Have you seen Duke Fame's
current album?

564
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,598
Um... Yes, yes.

565
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,266
Have you seen the cover?

566
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,559
No, I don't think I have.

567
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:02,727
It's a rather lurid cover.

568
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,313
I mean, it's like
naked women, and...

569
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,858
He's tied down to this table,
and they've got these whips,

570
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,319
and they're all
semi-nude... Knocking on him.

571
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,904
And it's like... It's much
worse... What's the point?

572
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,906
Well, the point is that it's
much worse than Smell the Glove.

573
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,450
He releases that,
and he's number three!

574
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,826
Because he's the victim.

575
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,204
Their objections were that
she was the victim, you see.

576
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,288
Oh.
Oh.

577
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:25,083
That's all right. If the singer's the
victim, it's different. It's not sexist.

578
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,209
He did a twist on it.

579
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,460
DEREK: He did,
he turned it around.

580
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,170
We should have thought
of that. We were so close.

581
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:32,215
If we had all you guys tied up,
that probably would have been fine.

582
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,716
DEREK: But it's still
a stupid cover.

583
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,636
It's such a fine line
between stupid and clever.

584
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,471
Yeah, just that
little turnabout.

585
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,723
I have a small
piece of bad news.

586
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,308
Although, it may not be that
bad. DAVID: For a change.

587
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,352
We're canceled here.

588
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,187
DAVID: At the hotel?

589
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,690
No, we're canceled.
The gig is canceled.

590
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,983
DAVID: Fuck.

591
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,821
It says, "Memphis show canceled
due to lack of advertising funds."

592
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:58,116
The last time
Tap toured America,

593
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:03,413
they were booked into 10,000-seat
arenas and 15,000-seat venues.

594
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:06,582
And it seems that now,
on the current tour,

595
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:11,462
they're being booked into
1,200-seat arenas, 1,500-seat arenas,

596
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:15,591
and I was just wondering, does this mean
the popularity of the group is waning?

597
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,802
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no.

598
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,597
No, not at all.
I just think that

599
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,017
their appeal is
becoming more selective.

600
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,101
Ah.

601
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,021
Now, I notice this here, you
got this cricket bat here.

602
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,397
Yes.
Do you play?

603
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,066
No, I carry this
partly out of...

604
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,193
I don't know, sort of...

605
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,697
I suppose,
what's the word?

606
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,823
Affectation?

607
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,493
Yes, I mean, it's a kind of
totemistic thing, you know?

608
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,495
But, to be quite frank
with you,

609
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,331
it's come in useful
on a couple situations.

610
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,667
Certainly, in the topsy-turvy
world of heavy rock,

611
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:53,921
having a good solid piece of wood
in your hand is quite often useful.

612
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,799
I miss you, too, darling.

613
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,510
Um... Not too well,
actually.

614
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,262
Well, we've got some
cancellations, that's all.

615
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,514
We got to Memphis and
there's no gig in Memphis,

616
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,309
and we find out this
promoter in the Midwest

617
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,771
has pulled out
St. Louis and Kansas City

618
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,733
and Des Moines.

619
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,612
I don't know, it's in
Indiana or something.

620
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,490
I thought...

621
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,201
Don't tease me.

622
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,495
That's not until
April. Great!

623
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,414
We'll do it!
Oh, fucking great.

624
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,126
Milwaukee.
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

625
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,463
I have no idea. You might have
to take a plane to New York,

626
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,299
and then go to
Milwaukee from there.

627
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,054
Oh, God, I love you, too.
Okay, bye.

628
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,099
(SIGHING IN RELIEF)

629
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,475
Well, my problems
are solved, mate.

631
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,728
Was Jeanine, she's
gonna come meet us.

632
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:55,400
She was supposed to do this window
layout for Neil Kite's boutique.

633
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:56,901
But it's not
until April!

634
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,362
Is she coming to drop some stuff
off? You know, and going right back?

635
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,906
No, no. She's coming on her
own. She's gonna travel with us.

636
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,408
She's gonna go on
the road with us.

MAN: Turn it up.
Turn it up!

638
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,036
She says she can hear that I'm
eating too much sugar on the phone.

639
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,163
She says my larynx is fat.

to come next door.

00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,469

Going all the way
back to 1965, that one.

653
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,910
Doesn't it feel good?

654
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,455
With The Thamesmen
and Cups and Cakes.

DEREK: You're an oldie!

656
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,333
Of course, The Thamesmen later
changed their name to Spinal Tap.

657
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,793
They had a couple
of nice size hits.

658

DEREK: Fuck you.

661
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,845
DAVID: I'm not really sure
this was such a great idea.

662
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,765
I mean, I don't feel any
better than I did at the hotel.

from here, before he died.

Well, since my baby left me

667
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,574
I found a new place to dwell

00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,246
At Heartbreak Hotel

670
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,956
Do it with the
harmony parts.

671
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,082
All right.

672
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,918
Well, since my baby left me...
Since my baby...

673
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,836
The same key,
though, I think.

674
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,756
Well, since my baby left me
Since my baby left me

675
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
If I'm going...

676
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,342
Since my baby left me

677
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,801
Left me

678
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:46,844
Me

679
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:47,929
No, you can't
hit that note.

680
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,514
Since my...

681
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,725
Since my baby left me
Since my baby left me

682
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,187
Well, I found
a new place to dwell

683
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,356
That's all right.
Not really, not really.

684
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,107
Voice down.
Well, it sounds raga.

685
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,234
You don't want to
go raga on this.

686
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,610
No, not with this, it don't. It does.

687
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,945
Well, since my baby left me

688
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,905
It sounds fucking
barbershop. Don't... Hey.

689
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,198
Barbershop raga.

690
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,449
Watch the...
Watch the language.

691
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:11,202
You're paying homage to
the King. A new hybrid.

692
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,453
Sorry.

693
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,706
DAVID: (SIGHING) This is
thoroughly depressing.

694
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,292
It really puts perspective
on things, though, doesn't it?

695
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,796
Too much. There's too much
fucking perspective now.

696
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,840
In 1967, you...

697
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,927
That was the first time
Spinal Tap came into existence.

698
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,388
Well, the whole world was
changing in those days.

699
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,681
And also we had
the world's ear...

700
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:32,890
We were changing
the world.

701
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,268
...because we had just released
an enormous-selling single.

702
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,728
(Listen to the) Flower
People. Flower People.

703
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,064
We toured the world,
we toured the States...

704
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,691
DEREK: We toured the world
and elsewhere.

705
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:42,984
It was a dream come true.

706
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,694
(SINGING) Listen

707
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:48,030

708
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,284
(ALL VOCALIZING)

709
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,082
Listen, it's getting
louder every day

710
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:05,673
(SHUSHING) Listen, it's
like a bolt out of the blue

711
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,510
(ALL VOCALIZING)

712
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:15,182
Listen, it could be
calling now for you

713
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,689
(MUSIC PLAYING)

714
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,571
(MOUTHING)

715
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,538
MARTY: Now during the Flower
People period, who was your drummer?

716
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,957
Stumpy's replacement,
Peter "James" Bond,

717
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,960
he also died in
mysterious circumstances.

718
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,086
We were playing a...

719
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,129
Festival.

720
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,756
...jazz-blues festival.
Where was that?

721
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,716
NIGEL: Blues-jazz, really.
DEREK: Blues-jazz festival.

722
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,302
It was the Isle...
It was in the Isle of...

723
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,386
Isle of Lucy.
Isle of Lucy.

724
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,305
The Isle of Lucy Jazz-Blues
Festival. Isle of Lucy.

725
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,184
And it was tragic, really.
He exploded on stage.

726
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,478
(DAVID SNAPS FINGERS)
DAVID: Just like that.

727
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:01,604
DEREK: He just went up.

728
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,315
He just was like a flash of green light,

729
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,109
and that was it.
Nothing was left.

730
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,694
DAVID: Look at his face.
Well, there was.

731
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
It's true, this really
did happen. It's true.

732
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,823
There was a little green
globule on his drum seat.

733
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:13,908
DAVID: Like a
stain, really.

734
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,785
NIGEL: It was more of a stain
than a globule, actually, and...

735
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:18,120
You know, several... You
know, dozens of people

736
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,539
spontaneously
combust each year.

737
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,333
It's just not really widely reported.

738
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,668
Right.

739
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,878
(PLAYING)

740
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,214
Testing.
Hello, hello.

741
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:31,384
Test, test, test. This is mic
number one. This is mic number one.

742
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,510
Isn't this
a lot of fun?

743
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,428
Two, two.
Okay, got the mics.

744
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,807
Let's do GSM,
all right? GSM.

745
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,937
DAVID: (SINGING)
Stop wasting my time

746
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,400
You know what I want

747
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,445
You know what I need

748
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,782
Or maybe you don't

749
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:01,747
Do I have to come right smack
damn out and tell you everything?

750
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,750
Gimme some money

751
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,130
Gimme some money

752
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,464
Oh, yeah!

753
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,763
JEANINE: Hello, darling.

754
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,434
Hello, I've got a
surprise for you.

755
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,227
DAVID: Hey! Where'd
you come from?

756
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,563
Where do you
think I came from?

757
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,940
Bloody airplane,
didn't I? Right?

758
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:30,901
(LAUGHS)

759
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:35,406
DEREK: David. David.
David. David.

760
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:42,246
JEANINE: Feels good. I've been wanting
to do that for the longest time.

761
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,666
Want me to carry
you about with me?

762
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,918
What's all this?
What? Tell me.

763
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,044
That's the film crew.

764
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,047
I told you about this.
It's the film crew. Martin?

765
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,215
Hi, Martin.
This is Jeanine.

766
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,759
Hello.
MARTY: Hello.

767
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,428
Here it is! It's
Visitors' Day, isn't it?

768
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,596
Here it is, lads!

769
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,722
We better turn to...

770
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,140
Smell the Glove,
me old beauties!

771
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,266
MAN: Oh, really?

772
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,392
Gather around.
Where's David?

773
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:04,477
Come on, Ian,
you're kidding.

774
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,771
David. David,
get up here!

775
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:10,524
DEREK ON PA: David, Smell the
Glove is here. Hello, Jeanine.

776
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,276
IAN: The moment we've all
been waiting for.

777
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,944
I thought
I'd never see it.

778
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,946
IAN: Here we go. I never
thought I'd live to see the day.

779
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,656
Plenty for everybody.

780
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:18,824
Wait a minute.
A little fanfare.

781
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:19,950
What do you think?

782
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,327
Is this the
test pressing?

783
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,912
No, this is it.
Yes, that's right.

784
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,580
This is Smell the Glove
by Spinal Tap?

785
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,165
When you go to the store...
That's Smell the Glove.

786
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,919
That's the jacket cover that's going
out across the country in every store.

787
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,670
Is this the compromise you made? Yes.

788
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,172
Is it going to say anything
here or along the spine?

789
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,924
It doesn't even say anything?
It's not going to say anything.

790
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,634
It's just going to be all
black? It's going to be that,

791
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,261
simple, beautiful,
classic.

792
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,055
Does look like, you know, black leather.

793
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,182
You can see yourself
in both sides.

794
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,809
DAVID: I wouldn't
feel so bad...

795
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,644
DEREK: It's like a black
mirror. Yeah, it is.

796
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,437
Well, I think it
looks like death.

797
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,439
It looks like mourning.
I mean, it looks...

798
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:53,317
David, David, every movie in
every cinema is about death.

799
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,985
Death sells!

800
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,779
I think he's right,
there's something about this

801
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:00,658
that's so black, it's like, "How
much more black could this be?"

802
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:04,328
And the answer is,
"None, none more black."

803
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,664
I think you're, like,
rationalizing this whole thing

804
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,750
into something that
you did on purpose.

805
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,127
I think we're stuck
with a very, very stupid

806
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,255
and a very
dismal-looking album.

807
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,506
This is depressing!

808
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,841
This is something you
wear around your arm,

809
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,092
you don't put this on
your fucking turntable.

810
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,260
NIGEL: David, it's a choice.

811
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,679
I frankly think that this
is the turning point, okay?

812
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,181
I think this is...
We're on our way now.

813
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:26,600
It's time to kick ass!
DAVID: I agree, I agree.

00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,478
do you have any
fears for your life?

842
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,689
When I did join, you know,
they did tell me.

843
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,649
They kind of took
me aside and said,

844
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,277
"Well, Mick, you know,
it's like this."

845
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,321
And it did kind of
freak me out a bit,

846
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:29,575
but it can't always
happen to... Can it?

847
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,368
Right. Right.

happened to drift
through my transom.

And she sort of sorted it out for
me, straightened it out for me.

to me sometimes

wants to tell me about, you know,

good," or, "That's bad,"

over with the other band members?

I mean, you...

891
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,553
Well, what happens is, she gives
me the brutally frank version,

892
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,679
and I sort of tart
it up for them.

893

Yeah.

They don't dislike
each other at all. No.

that I'm doing,

which I always find

911
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,529
is really the saddest
of all keys.

00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:16,666
We did. We did massive, we did
massive. Sponsoring, vast...

1013
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:17,876
We saturated.
We oversaturated.

1014
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,336
DAVID: They said
vast radio support.

1015
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,838
That's what it is. It's
me. I did it. I fucked up.

1016
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,924
I fucked up the timing, that's
all. I fucked up the timing.

1017
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,176
I got no timing, I got no
timing. I got no timing.

1018
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,345
You know what I want you to do?
Will you do something for me?

1019
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,180
What?
Do me a favor.

1020
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,265
Just kick my
ass, okay?

1021
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,100
Kick this ass for
a man, that's all.

1022
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,310
Kick my ass!
No.

1023
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,395
Enjoy! Come on.
I'm not asking,

1024
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,147
I'm telling with this.
Kick my ass.

1025

00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,121
DEREK: Well, we've kept them waiting
long enough. Let's do it to them.

1028
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,206
DAVID: Come on, Mick!

(DAVID KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1030
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,209
Let's go, Mr. Shrimpton.

1031
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,629
Rock 'n' roll!

1032
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,467
MAN: Let's hear some
rock 'n' roll!

1033
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,803
Rock 'n' roll!
Let's go, then.

1034
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:12,847
Yeah, mate.

1035
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,600
It's gonna be a hot one, isn't it?

1036
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:16,726
DAVID: It's gonna
be a great show.

1037
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,770
No, it's not an exit.
It's not an exit.

1038
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,355
Don't want an exit.
No, that's true.

1039
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,274
Oh, this way.
Hope so.

1040
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,651
Yeah, this way, let's
go. Probably this way.

1041
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,320
(HUMMING)

1042
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,533
Wait. DEREK: This
looks familiar, though.

1043
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,410
Listen.
Really does.

1046
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,083
That way.

1047
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,336
Let's not lose it, now.
Let's not lose it.

1048
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,797
Where the fuck is Ian?
You know, he should be here.

1049
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,882
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

1050
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,677
We gotta get to it
some way.

1051
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,804
We've been on stage, right?

1052
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,974
We're in the group.

1053
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,851
DAVID: We're in the group
that's playing tonight.

1054
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,228
You go right straight
through this door here,

1055
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,522
down the hall,
turn right,

1056
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,443
and then there's a little
jog there, about 30 feet.

1057
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,403
Jog to the... We don't
have time for that.

1058
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,697
Go straight ahead. We'll
trust you, we'll trust you.

1059
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,492
Turn right the next two
corners, and first door, a sign,

1060
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,620
"Authorized
Personnel Only,"

1061
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,622
open that door.
That's the stage.

1062
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,332
You think so?
You're authorized.

1063
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,833
You're musicians, aren't
you? We've got the guitars.

1064
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,835
Exactly. Thank you, thank you very much.

1065
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,420
Rock 'n' roll!

1066
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,631
Rock 'n' roll!
Yeah!

Let's get it,
let's get it!

00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,302
No, he said this way.

1069
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,429
Straight here. Rock 'n' roll!
Here we go! Rock 'n' roll!

1070
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:38,016
Hello, Cleveland!
Hello, Cleveland!

1071
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,684
NIGEL: Let's go in.

1072
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:40,935
Fuck!

1073
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,521
You must have
made a wrong turn.

1074
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,190
We've got to
go another way.

1075
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:48,818
Other way.
Other way. Other way.

1076
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,654
DAVID: I hate to keep
harping on this,

1077
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:53,865
but I think that the notion of a
black album has really cursed us.

1078
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,493
IAN: Believe me, we're getting some
very substantial reports of air play.

1079
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,244
I don't think we have
to worry about that.

1080
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,622
You know, it might
have been better

1081
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,041
if the album had
been mixed right.

1082
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,793
Well, there's no use
crying over that.

1083
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,628
Of course, that's true.
I mean...

1084
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,129
Well, it
just wasn't...

1085
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:09,547
It was mixed all wrong,
wasn't it?

1086
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:10,632
It was mixed wrong?
Yeah.

1087
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,217
Were you there? How do you
know... You couldn't hear...

1088
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,302
DAVID: She's heard the record.
No, but I've heard the album.

1089
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:16,846
So your judgment is
it was mixed wrong.

1090
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,682
You couldn't hear
the lyrics on all of it.

1091
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,225
DAVID: You don't agree that
you can't hear the vocals?

1092
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,143
NIGEL: No,
I do not agree. No.

1093
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:25,188
Well, I think maybe it's interesting
that she's bringing it up.

1094
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,898
Well, she'd like
to hear vocals.

1095
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,441
It's like me saying,
you know,

1096
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,194
"You're using the wrong
conditioner for your hair."

1097
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,570
DAVID: Don't be
stupid now.

1098
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:33,780
It looks sort of frizzy.

1099
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,282
JEANINE: You don't do heavy metal
in Doubly, you know. You mix it.

1100
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,118
In what? In what?

1101
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:40,453
What?
IAN: (LAUGHING) Dolby.

1102
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,122
In Doubly.
I mean, you can't...

1103
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,290
NIGEL: In Dublin? What's that?
DAVID: She means Dolby, all right?

1104
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,626
She means Dolby. You know
perfectly well what she means.

1105
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,712
DAVID: We shan't
recover from this one.

1106
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,088
We shan't recover
from this one.

1107
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,297
Come on.

1108
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,507
Can I have the floor
for just one moment?

1109
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,635
Because I've got something
I'd like to show you.

1110
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,888
Jeanine's been working
on these very hard.

1111
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:00,640
These are
a new direction...

1112
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,350
JEANINE: Got a new idea
for a new presentation.

1113
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:04,018
DAVID:...for the stage
look of the band.

1114
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,603
The signs of the zodiac for everyone.

1115
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,064
I thought we needed a new presentation.
It's the signs of the zodiac.

1116
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:09,816
This is a look for Viv.
He's a Libra.

1117
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,693
There's the yin-yang...

1118
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:13,903
JEANINE: Yin and the yang.
DAVID:...sort of look.

1119
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:17,115
This is Nigel.
He's a Capricorn.

1120
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,409
Sort of a goat look. JEANINE:
We've given you a little beard.

1121
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,702
Is this a joke?

1122
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,911
DAVID: This is...

1123
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,747
Excuse me, is this a joke?

1124
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:25,665
DAVID: Just bear with us
for one moment, please.

1125
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,418
This, I love this.
I wish I were the Cancer.

1126
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:29,711
That's attractive.

1127
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:30,837
This is your crab face.

1128
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,213
Your brainchild, now.

1129
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,506
Give it a chance,
give it a chance.

1130
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,550
And this is David...
David's the lion.

1131
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:40,221
Please wait a minute. Have
you any idea what it will cost

1132
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,475
to dress up
the band as animals?

1133
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,726
Well, they're
not animals.

1134
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,894
They're signs of the zodiac.

1135
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,771
It's a way
to fight the drabs.

1136
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,606
You know,
we've got the drabs.

1137
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,734
That's true. I think mine
will look better in Doubly,

1138
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,527
if it was done in Doubly.

1139
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:57,989
I'm quite open-minded enough.

1140
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,282
DEREK: David.
No, no, David.

1141
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,118
You know, there are
solutions to our problems.

1142
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,203
I think we know
what they are.

1143
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,371
DAVID: I've yet to hear them.
I've yet to hear them.

1144
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,956
JEANINE: Since you're all
such geniuses...

1145
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,209
We take a rational approach,
we can say...

1146
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,211
May I make a suggestion?
I've got one other suggestion.

1147
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,754
DAVID: Let's hear yours.
Let's hear your suggestion.

1148
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,964
Stonehenge. Stonehenge.

1149
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,092
What about it? Best production
value we've ever had on stage.

1150
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,344
But we haven't
got the equipment.

1151
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,054
We haven't got Stonehenge.
Not yet we don't.

1152
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,473
Let's... Please,
please, just a moment.

1153
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,642
IAN: We know it works. NIGEL:
Musically, we all know it.

1154
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:26,810
IAN: I don't think
it's a bad idea.

1155
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:27,852
NIGEL: Musically,
we all know it, right?

1156
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:30,688
No problems musically.
We go right on stage,

1157
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,482
and it's quite simple.

1158
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,776
Ian can take care of this.

1159
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,736
DAVID: I know what the
Stonehenge monument looks like.

1160
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:38,571
We don't have that piece
of scenery anymore.

1161
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,907
NIGEL: I know,
so we build a new one.

1162
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:43,743
And this it.

1163
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,411
Consider it done.

1164
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,872
So, you're just gonna
take care of it like that?

1165
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:50,166
You're gonna find someone to
design it, using that as a plan?

1166
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,251
Let's try.
Let's try.

1167
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,418
If you can do it,
I'll do the number.

1168
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,172
Do you feel that,
in collaboration with David,

1169
00:52:56,257 --> 00:53:00,718
that you are afforded the opportunity
to express yourself musically

1170
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:01,970
the way you would like to?

1171
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:04,305
Well, I think I do,
in my solos.

1172
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,974
My solos are
my trademark.

This looks absolutely
perfect. I mean, it's...

1177
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,399
It's the right proportions.
It'll be this color, eh?

1178
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:59,110
Yeah.
That's just terrific.

1179
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,071
I mean, it almost looks like
the real thing. You got it.

1180
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,116
Yeah. When we get the actual
set, when we get the piece,

1181
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,993
it'll follow exactly
these specifications,

1182
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,912
even these contours
and everything?

1183
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:12,749
I don't understand, Ian.
The actual piece?

1184
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,043
When you build
the actual piece.

1185
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,378
But this is what you
asked for, isn't it?

1186
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:18,838
What?

1187
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,506
Well, this is the piece.

1188
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:21,674
This is the piece?

1189
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,009
Yes.

1190
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,844
Are you telling
me that this is it?

1191
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,430
This is scenery?

1192
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,390
Have you ever
been to Stonehenge?

1193
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:30,683
No, I've never
been to Stonehenge.

1194
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,685

are 20-feet high!

1195
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,604
You can stand four men up them. Ian!

1196
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,648
I was asked to build it...
This is insane!

1197
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,816
This isn't a piece of scenery.
...18 inches high. Look, look.

1198
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,818
Look, this is what I
was asked to build.

1199
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:44,197
Eighteen inches. Right
here, it specified 18 inches.

1200
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,115
I was given this napkin.
I mean...

1201
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Forget this!

1202
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,284

Hundreds of years
before the dawn of history

1206
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,718
Lived an ancient

The Druids

1208
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,902
No one knows who they were

1209

Or what they were doing

1210
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,912

where a man's a man

And the children
dance to the pipes of Pan

won't you take my hand?

might come too soon

00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:38,955
DAVID: I do not, for one, think that
the problem was that the band was down.

1226
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,623
I think that
the problem may have been

1227
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,250
that there was
a Stonehenge monument

1228
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:46,129
on the stage that was in danger
of being crushed by a dwarf.

1229
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:50,550
All right? That tended to understate
the hugeness of the object.

1230
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:53,052
I really think you're just making
much too big a thing out of it.

1231
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:55,638
Making a big thing out of it
would have been a good idea.

1232
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,558
Nigel gave me a drawing that
said 18 inches, all right?

1233
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,017
I know he did, and that's
what I'm talking about.

1234
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:02,645
Whether he knows the difference between
feet and inches is not my problem.

1235
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:03,771
I do what I'm told.

1236
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:05,982
But you're not as
confused as him, are you?

1237
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,651
I mean, it's not your job to
be as confused as Nigel is.

1238
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,153
It's my job to do
what I'm asked to do

1239

element of this band.

1240
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,281
And that's what I did.

1241
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,866
The audience were laughing.

1242
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:17,034
So it became a comedy
number. Yes, it did.

1243
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,162
Yes, it fucking well did,
and it was not pleasant

1244
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,997
to be part of
the comedy on stage.

1245
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:23,374
Backstage, perhaps
it was very amusing.

1246
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:27,086
Maybe we just fix the
choreography, keep the dwarf clear.

1247
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,173
DAVID: What do you mean?
So he won't trod upon it.

1248
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:31,716
I don't think
that's the issue.

1249
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:37,054
I think it's symptomatic that maybe
you're taking on more than you can handle.

1250
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,808
It's not exactly the first time
you've messed things up, is it?

1251
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:43,352
DAVID: I mean, there have
been some gaping holes

1252
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:44,437
in the business
end of this...

1253
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,688
IAN: Excuse me
for a minute, David.

1254
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,608
Excuse me, this is
a band meeting, right?

1255
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,568
Are you here for some reason?
DAVID: Don't worry about it.

1256
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:51,819
DAVID: She's with me.
JEANINE: Yeah.

1257
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:53,946
Is she now in the band?
Is she singing backup?

1258
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,407
JEANINE: I care what
happens to the band.

1259
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,869
David, whenever a single bump or a
ruffle comes into this little fantasy,

1260
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:03,164
adolescent fantasy world you
guys have built around yourself,

1261
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,709
you start screaming like a
bunch of poncey hairdressers.

1262
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,213
I mean, it's just a problem,
you know? It gets solved.

1263
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,381
JEANINE: It doesn't.
You can't live in a bubble.

1264
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,383
If it got solved,
that would be all right.

1265
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,760
But it doesn't get solved.

1266
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,221
What do you think happened out
there? What got solved tonight?

1267
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,724
The one thing that goes wrong,
one single thing goes wrong,

1268
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,184
100 things go right.

1269
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,228
Do you know what I spend
my time doing? What?

1270
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,313
I sleep two or
three hours a night.

1271
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:29,398
There's no sex and
drugs for Ian, David.

1272
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,776
You know what I do?
I find lost luggage.

1273
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,737
I locate mandolin strings
in the middle of Austin!

1274
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,740
I pries the rent out of the
local Hebrews. That's what I do.

1275
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,992
JEANINE: Maybe you should get
someone else to find the lost luggage,

1276
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,161
and you should concentrate
on what's going on onstage.

1277
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:43,621
DAVID: Yes! That's
what we're talking about.

1278
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,164
You'd like me to be the
road manager? All bad... No!

1279
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,208
All bad... Could we...

1280
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:51,337
What David's trying to say, if
you'll let him get a word through,

1281
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,966
is you could maybe
do with some help.

1282
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,219
Some help? It's very
simple, it's very simple.

1283
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,262
It's that clear.

1284
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,722
Maybe there's someone
already in the organization.

1285
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:02,974
We don't have
to pay insurance.

1286
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,809
We don't have to
pay extra room, et cetera.

1287
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:07,103
Since she's already here,
she's already among us,

1288
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:08,521
and she can...
IAN: She?

1289
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,773
She's perfectly capable
to taking over. She?

1290
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:12,692
Wait a minute! Well, who do
you think I'm talking about?

1291
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:14,777
Who do you think I'm talking
about? I would never have dreamed

1292
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,612
in a million years, that it
was her you were talking about.

1293
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:17,780
Why not?

1294
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,824
I am offering to help out.

1295
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:21,033
No, you're not
offering to help out.

1296
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,994
You're offering to co-manage
the band with me, is that it?

1297
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,120
Yes.
Let's get it straight...

1298
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,288
DAVID: In so many words,
that is exactly it.

1299
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,372
JEANINE: Exactly.

1300
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,457
Well, I'm certainly not going
to co-manage with some girl

1301
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:29,625
just because
she's your girlfriend.

1302
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:30,960
His girlfriend, is it?
Don't call her my girlfriend.

1303
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,545
IAN: All right, she's not
your girlfriend. I don't know.

1304
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,963
You couldn't manage
a classroom full of kids.

1305
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,214
I don't know what you're
doing managing the band.

1306
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:36,757
DAVID: Why don't we just...
Shut up!

1307
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:39,510
Look, look. I...
This is my position, okay?

1308
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,053
I am not
managing it with you...

1309
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,264
Good. ...or any other woman,
especially one who dresses

1310
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,641

nightmare. So, fuck you.

1311
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:46,809
Well, fuck you, too.
Fuck all of you,

1312
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,644
because I quit.
All right?

1313
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,229

question at this point?

1317
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,909
DAVID: Yeah.

1318
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:05,453
Are we gonna do
Stonehenge tomorrow?

1319
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,706
No, we're not gonna
fucking do Stonehenge!

1320
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,917
Okay, we're all set.
Thank you.

1321
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,295
All right, fellas,
I've got the tickets.

1322
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:17,715
We're on the 3:10 flight
at Gate 24.

1323
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,676
All right? And this
arrives at 4:00 in Colorado.

1324
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:23,346
Then we got a limo
to take us to the lodge.

1325
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:26,349
DAVID: It's about 100 yards
from Rainbow Trout Studio.

1326
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:30,686
What I've done is to arrange
a whole load of charts.

1327
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:32,355
Wait till you see this.
This is so great.

1328
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:35,775
Now, I know that
the band's sign is Virgo

1329
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:38,861
and, you see it,
Saturn's in the third house,

1330
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,988
all right,
and it's a bit rocky.

1331
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:46,994
But because Virgo is one of the most
highly intelligent signs of the zodiac,

1332
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:49,538
we're gonna pull through
this with great aplomb.

1333
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,248
Yeah. And has someone not got one?

1334
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,042
It's so clear. Really is. Nigel
hasn't got one. Here you go.

1335
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,377
It's so clear.
Nigel.

1336
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:57,755
Nigel! I've got pages for
you. I think Nigel has one.

1337
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,465
DAVID: He's got one.
He's got it.

1338
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,549
JEANINE: If you have
a look at this...

1339
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,177
If you think about the jumble
the tour book usually is...

1340
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,345
No, he's got one.
He's got one.

1341
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,471
He's got one?
All right.

1342
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,680
DAVID: And what's all this
on the...

1343
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,766
JEANINE: Now, what I want to explain
to you here, is that Denver...

1344
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:13,729
How would you characterize your
relationship with David over the years?

1345
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:15,856
Has it changed in any way?

1346
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,025
Not really. I mean, you know, they go...

1347
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,819
We've grown up.

1348
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,656
But, really, it's not...
No, not really.

1349
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:28,327
We feel like children much of
the time, even when we're playing.

1350
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,996
We're closer than brothers.

1351
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,250
Brothers always fight.

1352
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,293
Sort of disagreements
and all that.

1353
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:41,841
We really have a relationship
that's way, way past that.

1354
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,053
(SCREAMING)

1355
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:49,056
He can't play
the fucking guitar anymore.

1356
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:50,182
DEREK ON MIC:
You know the parts.

1357
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,559
You did it this morning.
No, he doesn't know the...

1358
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:54,103
If he knew the fucking part,
he'd play it, wouldn't he?

1359
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,563
That's it.
DAVID: Are you walking out?

1360
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,064
Fuck. I'm not planning on walking out.

1361
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:58,315
Great.
Just tell me

1362
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,525
what I'm supposed to do,
all right?

1363
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,819
Well, we're supposed to play
the fucking thing, aren't we?

1364
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,696
We have no choice.
We spent an hour and half...

1365
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,114
Well, I'm doing my part.
...setting up this...

1366
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,615
You know what would
make this a lot simpler?

1367
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,909
I mean, I hate to
cut right to it here.

1368
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,578
Why don't you
play this alone,

1369
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:12,496
without some fucking angel
hanging over your head,

1370
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:13,956
you know what I mean?

1371
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,584
DEREK: Jesus Christ.
This is fucking all we need.

1372
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,628
You can't fucking concentrate
because of your fucking wife.

1373
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:20,838
Simple as that, all right?

1374
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,006
It's your fucking wife.

1375
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,132
She's not my wife.

1376
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,633
Well, whatever the
fuck she is, all right?

1377
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:26,093
You can't concentrate.

1378
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:27,928
We can't fucking do that
track. This is unbelievable.

1379
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,014
This is unbelievable. No,
it's not unbelievable at all.

1380
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:31,474
Will you check me on this?
It all leads up to this.

1381
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,309
Am I losing my fucking mind?
It all leads up to this.

1382
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:35,186
Can you check me on this?
Am I losing my mind?

1383
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:38,189
I don't understand what
this has to do with anything.

1384
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:40,399
We're very lucky
in the sense that

1385
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:42,985
we've got two visionaries
in the band.

1386
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:46,489
You know, David and Nigel
are both... MARTY: Right.

1387
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,324
...like poets, you know.

1388
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,534
Like Shelley or Byron
or people like that.

1389
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:53,662
They're two totally distinct
types of visionaries.

1390
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:56,165
It's like fire and ice,
basically, you see,

1391
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,167
and I feel my role
is to, in the band,

1392
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,752
is to be kind of
in the middle of that.

1393
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,754
Kind of like lukewarm water, in a sense.

1394
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:12,181
Listen, I don't think we've
got time to go to the hotel.

1395
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,849
I think you better go
straight to the base.

1396
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:14,975
DEREK: To the what?

1397
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,393
VIV: Base?
The gig.

1398
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,187
Yeah, to the base. DEREK:
To the Civic Arena, right?

1399
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,271
NIGEL: Yeah.
No!

1400
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:20,481
No, that fell through.

1401
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,732
DEREK: We had it.
What do you mean?

1402
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,150
Wait a second.
Hold it, hold it.

1403
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:25,611
What do you... Do you know about
this and we don't know about this?

1404
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,820
What are you talking about?

1405
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:28,197
JEANINE: We're going
to the Air Force base.

1406
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,949
Why are we going
to an Air Force base?

1407
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,451
'Cause the original gig
fell through.

I'm Lieutenant

Welcome to Lindberg
Air Force Base.

1415
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:51,428
Is this your gentlemen's first
visit to a military facility?

1416
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,305
ALL: Yeah.
Fine, may I start by saying

1417
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,057
how thrilled we are
to have you here?

1418
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,809
We are such
fans of your music

1419
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,602
and all of your records.
DAVID: That's great.

1420
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:00,271
I'm not speaking
of yours personally,

1421
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:01,897
but the whole genre
of the rock 'n' roll.

1422
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:03,023
DAVID: I understand that.
JEANINE: Yeah.

1423
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:04,233
And so many of
the exciting things

1424
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,359
that are happening
in music today.

1425
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,527
And let me explain a bit
about what's going on.

1426
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:09,488
This is our monthly
"at-ease weekend."

1427
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,532
It gives us a chance
to kind of let down our hair.

1428
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:14,243
(LAUGHING) Although, I see you
all have a head start on that.

1429
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,787
These haircuts wouldn't pass
military muster, believe me.

1430
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,163
Although,
I shouldn't talk.

1431
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:19,498
My hair's getting
a little shaggy, too.

1432
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,749
Better not get
too close to you.

1433
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:21,917
They'll think I'm
part of the band.

1434
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:23,210
I'm joking, of course.

1435
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:24,461
Shall we go in,
and I'll show you around?

1436
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:27,881
HOOKSTRATTEN: Walk this way,
please. Right through here.

1437
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:30,426
Did you ever run into a musical
group, works out of Kansas City,

1438
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:32,386
calls himself Four
Jacks and a Jill?

1439
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,388
They've been at a Ramada Inn
there for about 18 months.

1440
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:37,308
If you're ever in Kansas City and
you want to hear some good music,

1441
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:39,435
you might want
to drop by.

1442
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,646
I would like to
get the playing on

1443
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:45,357
about 19:00 hours if
that's satisfactory.

1444
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:46,859
When will that be?

1445
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,445
I make it now,
it's about 18:30 hours.

1446
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:50,821
So, that's what?
50 hours?

1447
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:52,197
120 hours?

1448
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,158
That's actually
about 30 minutes.

1449
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:55,534
About a half hour,
give or take just

1450
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:56,869
a few minutes.
I don't want to rush you.

1451
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,955
The idea is if we can get it
on, then we get it over with.

1452
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,040
And I have
just one request.

1453
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:03,334
Would you play a couple of
slow numbers so I can dance?

in Europe? I mean...

1551
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:36,064
Well, I don't, I don't really
think that the end can be assessed,

1552
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:39,484
as of itself,
as being the end,

1553
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,153
because what does
the end feel like?

It's like saying when you try and
extrapolate the end of the universe.

01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:51,398
Not a dry seat in the house

1666
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:54,526
Next day,
we'll be on our way

1667
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,986
But, tonight,
I'm gonna rock you

1668
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,571
Yeah, tonight,
we're gonna rock you

1669
01:16:58,656 --> 01:16:59,781
DEREK AND NIGEL:
Tonight, I'm gonna rock you

1670
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,074
Tonight!

1671
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:12,377
Little girl,
it's a great big world

1672
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,379
But there's only one of

1673
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,301
Me!

1674
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:39,654
MARTY: Do you feel that playing rock
'n' roll music keeps you a child?

1675
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:43,491
That is, keeps you in a state
of arrested development?

1676
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:45,952
No, no.
No, I feel it's like...

1677
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:49,622
It's more like going to a
national park or something,

1678
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:52,167
and there's, you know,
they preserve the moose.

1679
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,252
And that's my
childhood up there

1680
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:56,338
on stage,
is that moose, you know?

1681
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:58,673
So, when you're playing, you feel
like a preserved moose on stage?

1682
01:17:58,758 --> 01:17:59,758
Yeah.

1683
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,009
I've been listening
to the classics.

1684
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:03,595
I belong to a
great series.

1685
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,973
It's called the Namesake
Series, of cassettes.

1686
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:09,184
And they send you the works
of famous authors

1687
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,978
done by actors with
the same last name.

1688
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:15,815
So I've got Denholm Elliott
reading T.S. Eliot on this one.

1689
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,484
Well, that's interesting. Yes.

1690
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,527
I've got Danny Thomas
doing A Child's

1691
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,529
Christmas in
Wales by Dylan Thomas.

1692
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:26,785
And next month, it's McLean Stevenson
reads Robert Louis Stevenson.

1693
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:28,495
Treasure Island,
I believe.

1694
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:30,455
That's interesting.
That's fascinating. Yeah.

1695
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:31,790
There's also something...

1696
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:34,209
There's a shorter works
of Washington Irving

1697
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:36,544
read by someone
called Dr. J.

1698
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:38,338
Oh, that's
Julius Erving.

1699
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:40,173
There you go. Julius Erving,
the basketball player.

1700
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:41,383
In keeping with
the series, yeah.

1701
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:42,550
I didn't know that.

1702
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:43,635
You like this?

1703
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:44,886
MARTY: It's very nice.
It looks like Halloween.

1704
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:49,140
This is my exact inner
structure, done in a T-shirt.

1705
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,268
Exactly medically accurate.
See?

1706
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:54,312
So, in other words,
if we were to

1707
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:56,022
take all your
flesh and blood...

1708
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:57,565
Take them off.
And you'd see...

1709
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:58,983
This is what you'd see.

1710
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:00,360
It wouldn't be
green, though.

1711
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:01,820
It is green.

1712
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,406
You know, see how
your blood looks blue?

1713
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:05,782
Yeah, well,
that's just the vein,

1714
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:07,242
I mean, the color
of the vein, I mean.

1715
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,618
The blood is actually red.

1716
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,328
Oh, maybe
it's not green, then.

1717
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,455
Anyway, this is what I
sleep in sometimes. Yeah.

1718
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:14,707
MARTY: Denis Eton-Hogg,
the president

1719
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:17,710
of Polymer Records,
was recently knighted.

1720
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:21,256
What were the circumstances
surrounding his knighthood?

1721
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,091
The specific reason
why he was knighted

1722
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,510
was for the founding
of Hoggwood,

1723
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:29,514
which is a summer camp
for pale young boys.

1724
01:19:32,143 --> 01:19:33,560
MARTY: David St. Hubbins,

1725
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:36,062
I must admit, I've never heard
of anybody with that name.

1726
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:37,313
It's an unusual name.

1727
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:38,773
Well, he was
an unusual saint.

1728
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:40,400
He's not a very
well-known saint.

1729
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:41,985
Oh, there actually is...
There was a St. Hubbins?

1730
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:43,445
Oh, yes.
That's right, yes.

1731
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:45,029
Yeah. What was he the saint of?

1732
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:48,032
He was the patron saint
of quality footwear.

1733
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:52,871
You play to predominantly
a white audience.

1734
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,457
Do you feel your music
is racist in any way?

1735
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,792
No, not at all.
No, of course not.

1736
01:19:57,877 --> 01:20:00,295
You know, we say,
"Love your brother."

1737
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:01,671
We don't say it,
really, but...

1738
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,423
We don't literally say
it. No, we don't say it.

1739
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:05,508
We don't really literally mean
it. We don't believe it either.

1740
01:20:05,593 --> 01:20:07,719
But we're not racists.
But...

1741
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,220
That message
should be clear, anyway.

1742
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,680
We're anything
but racists.

1743
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:11,806
You know,
we've grown musically.

1744
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:13,183
I mean, you listen
to some of the rubbish

1745
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:15,477
we did early on, it
was stupid. MARTY: Yeah.

1746
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:18,104
You know, now, I mean,
a song like Sex Farm,

1747
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:21,107
we're taking
a sophisticated

1748
01:20:21,192 --> 01:20:24,569
view of the idea of sex,
you know, and...

1749
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,738
Putting it on a farm.
Yeah.

1750
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,282
MARTY: If I were to ask you
what your philosophy

1751
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,910
of life or your creed,
what would that be?

1752
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:38,166
Have a good time
all the time.

1753
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,128
That's my philosophy, Marty.

1754
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,339
I believe virtually
everything I read,

1755
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:48,843
and I think that is what makes
me more of a selective human

1756
01:20:48,928 --> 01:20:51,012
than someone who doesn't
believe anything.

1757
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:54,390
Do you have a philosophy
or creed that you live by?

1758
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:57,602
Well, you know, personally,
I like to think about

1759
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,604
sex and drugs and
rock 'n' roll, you know.

1760
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:00,688
That's my life.
Yeah.

1761
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:04,317
MARTY: If you were to have
something written as your epitaph...

1762
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,946
"Here lies David St. Hubbins,

1763
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,908
"and why not?"

1764
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:15,995
You feel that
sums up your...

1765
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,164
No, it's the first thing I
could think of. Oh, I see.

1766
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:19,582
It doesn't sum up
anything, really.

1767
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:20,959
Yeah.

1768
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:23,795
I'm a real fish nut.
I really like fish.

1769
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:25,630
MARTY: What kind of fish?

1770
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:28,341
Well, in the United States,
you have cod.

1771
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:29,926
I like cod.

1772
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:32,720
And I love tuna, those
little cans you've got here.

1773
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,472
Tuna fish.
Yeah.

1774
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:36,349
No bones.
Yeah.

1775
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:37,433
(CHUCKLES)

1776
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:41,896
MARTY: If you could not play
rock 'n' roll, what would you do?

1777
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:44,065
I'd be a full-time dreamer.

1778
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,150
I'd probably get
a bit stupid and start

1779
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:48,236
to make a fool of
myself in public,

1780
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,655
'cause there wouldn't
be a stage to go on.

1781
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,907
Probably work with children.

1782
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:56,494
As long as there's, you know,
sex and drugs,

1783
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,204
I can do without
the rock 'n' roll.

1784
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:02,875
I suppose I could work
in a shop of some kind,

1785
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:08,047
or do freelance selling
of some sort of product.

1786
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:10,174
A salesman?
You think...

1787
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,885
A salesman.
Maybe in a haberdasher.

1788
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:17,765
Or maybe like a
chapeau shop or something.

1789
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:22,270
You know, like, "Would you...
What size do you wear, sir?"

1790
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:23,354
And then you answer me.

1791
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:24,939
Seven and a quarter.

1792
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:26,899
"I think we have that."

1793
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:29,068
See, something like
that, I could do. Yeah.

1794
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:30,486
Do you think you'd be happy
doing something...

1795
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:33,281
"No, we're all out.
Do you wear black?"

1796
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:36,200
See, that sort of thing I think
I could probably muster up.

1797
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:39,245
Yeah. Do you think
you'd be happy doing that?

1798
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:41,706
Well, I don't know.
What are the hours?
