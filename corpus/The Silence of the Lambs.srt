WOODS NEAR QUANTICO, VA

1
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,436
Starling!

2
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,916
Starling!

3
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,718
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

4
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,796
Thank you, sir.

5
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,156
- Clarice.
- Hey.

6
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,190
You looking for Crawford? He should
be back in a minute. Wait in his office.

7
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,791
Starling.

8
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,196
- Clarice M. Good morning.
- Morning, Mr Crawford.

9
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,551
Sorry to pull you off the course
at such short notice.

10
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,752
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.

11
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,872
I hope so. They haven't
posted any grades yet.

12
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,628
A job's come up and I thought about you.

13
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,992
Not a job, really. More of
an interesting errand. Sit down.

14
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,872
Yes, sir.

15
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,836
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

16
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,794
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years. I gave you an A.

17
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,275
A-minus, sir.

18
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,877
Double major: psych and criminology.
Graduated magna.

19
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,673
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

20
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,476
It says, when you graduate, you wanna
work for me in Behavioural Science.

21
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,556
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

22
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,670
We're interviewing all serial killers now in
custody for a psycho-behavioural profile.

23
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,314
Could be a real help in unsolved cases.

24
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,874
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

25
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,279
- Do you spook easily, Starling?
- Not yet, sir.

26
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,073
See, the one we want most
refuses to cooperate.

27
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,873
I want you to go after him
again today in the asylum.

28
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,879
- Who's the subject?
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.

29
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,150
Hannibal the Cannibal.

30
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,840
I don't expect him to talk to you.

31
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,429
But I have to be able to say we tried.

32
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,552
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.

33
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,116
How does he look? How does
his cell look? Is he sketching, drawing?

34
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,800
If he is, what's he sketching?

35
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,320
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

36
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,836
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

37
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,520
Have your memo on my desk
by 0900 Wednesday.

38
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,596
OK.

39
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,915
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?
Lecter's been in prison for so many years.

40
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,237
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

41
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,911
I wish there were.
Now, I want your full attention, Starling.

42
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,350
- Yes, sir.
- Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

43
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,197
Dr Chilton at the asylum will go over all
the physical procedures used with him.

44
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,790
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

45
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,388
And you're to tell him nothing personal.

46
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,956
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

47
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,992
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

48
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,109
And what is that?

49
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,394
Oh, he's a monster. A pure psychopath.

50
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,950
So rare to capture one alive.

51
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,392
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

52
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,995
We get a lot of detectives here, but
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

53
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,674
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

54
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,715
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

55
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,956
I'm sure this is a great town, Dr Chilton,

56
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,279
but my instructions are to talk to Dr Lecter
and report back this afternoon.

57
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,597
I see. Well, let's make this quick, then.

58
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,271
We've tried to study him, but he's much
too sophisticated for the standard tests.

59
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,595
Oh, my, does he hate us!

60
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,837
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

61
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,913
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he, using you?

62
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,158
- What do you mean, sir?
- A pretty, young woman to turn him on.

63
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,234
I don't believe Lecter's
seen a woman in eight years.

64
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,069
And are you ever his taste! So to speak.

65
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,078
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It's not a charm school.

66
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,670
Good. Then you should
be able to remember the rules.

67
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,954
Do not touch or approach the glass.
You pass him nothing but soft paper.

68
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,675
No pencils or pens.
No staples or paperclips in his paper.

69
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,396
Use the sliding food carrier. If he attempts
to pass you anything, do not accept it.

70
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,035
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

71
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,352
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

72
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,838
On July 9, 1991, he complained of chest
pains and was taken to the dispensary.

73
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,520
His restraints were removed for an EKG.

74
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,235
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

75
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,671
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less, save one of her eyes.

76
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,191
His pulse never got above 95,
even when he ate her tongue.

77
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,753
- I keep him in here.
- Dr Chilton.

78
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,070
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

79
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,955
then maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself. What do you think?

80
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,790
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

81
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,948
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

82
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,758
When she's finished, bring her out.

83
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,638
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you,
don't get near the glass?

84
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,674
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

85
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,634
Nice to meet you, Clarice. You can
hang your coat up there if you like.

86
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,115
Thank you. I will.

87
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,588
He's past the others, the last cell.

88
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,075
You keep to the right.

89
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,713
- I put out a chair for you.
- That's very good. Thank you.

90
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,758
I'll be watchin'. You'll do fine.

91
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,996
Hi.

92
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,795
I can smell your cunt!

93
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,990
- Good morning.
- Dr Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.

94
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,917
May I speak with you?

95
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,554
You're one of Jack Crawford's,
aren't you?

96
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,753
- I am, yes.
- May I see your credentials?

97
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,316
Certainly.

98
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,715
Closer, please.

99
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,272
Closer.

100
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,757
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?

101
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,589
I'm still in training at the academy.

102
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,513
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

103
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,679
Yes, I'm a student.
I'm here to learn from you.

104
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,555
Maybe you can decide whether or not
I'm qualified enough to do that.

105
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,152
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

106
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,955
Sit, please.

107
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,034
Now then, tell me.
What did Miggs say to you?

108
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,754
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

109
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,952
He hissed at you. What did he say?

110
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,118
He said ''I can smell your cunt.''

111
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,874
I see.

112
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,355
I myself cannot.

113
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,955
You use Evyan skin cream.

114
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,353
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

115
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,995
But not today.

116
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,840
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

117
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,071
That is the Duomo
seen from the Belvedere.

118
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,957
- Do you know Florence?
- All that detail just from memory, sir?

119
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,959
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

120
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,712
Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

121
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,434
Oh, no, no, no, no.

122
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,236
You were doing fine. You had been
courteous and receptive to courtesy.

123
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,638
You had established trust, with
the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

124
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,311
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

125
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,910
- It won't do.
- I'm only asking you to look at this.

126
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,996
Either you will or you won't.

127
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,749
Yeah. Jack Crawford
must be very busy indeed

128
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,553
if he's recruiting help
from the student body.

129
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,353
Busy hunting that new one: Buffalo Bill.

130
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,630
What a naughty boy he is.

131
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,157
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

132
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,556
Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say.

133
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,114
It started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

134
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,153
They said
''This one likes to skin his humps.''

135
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,593
Why do you think he removes
their skins, Agent Starling?

136
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,870
Thrill me with your acumen.

137
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,839
It excites him. Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.

138
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,873
- I didn't.
- No. No, you ate yours.

139
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,476
You send that through now.

140
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,270
Oh, Agent Starling, you think you can
dissect me with this blunt little tool?

141
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,233
No. I thought that your knowledge...

142
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,510
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

143
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,350
Do you know what you look like, with
your good bag and your cheap shoes?

144
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,471
You look like a rube.

145
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,513
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube,
with a little taste.

146
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,515
Good nutrition's given you length of bone,

147
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,668
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash, are you?

148
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,590
And that accent you've tried so
desperately to shed: pure West Virginia.

149
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,713
What is your father, dear? Is he
a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp?

150
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,479
How quickly the boys found you.

151
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,070
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

152
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,556
while you could only dream of
getting out, getting anywhere,

153
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,673
getting all the way to the FBI.

154
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,159
You see a lot, Doctor.

155
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:04,116
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

156
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,678
What about it? Why don't you look at
yourself and write down what you see?

157
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,155
Or maybe you're afraid to.

158
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,598
A census taker once tried to test me.

159
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,871
I ate his liver with some fava beans

160
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,355
and a nice Chianti.

161
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,677
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

162
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,313
Fly, fly, fly.

163
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,753
I bit my wrist so I can die.

164
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,996
Look at the blood!

165
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,874
- Got ya!
- Miggs, you stupid fuck!

166
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,478
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Agent Starling! Come back!

167
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,354
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!
I would not have had that happen to you.

168
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,392
- Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly.
- Then do this test.

169
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,512
No, but I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

170
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,359
- And what is that?
- Advancement. Listen carefully.

171
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,994
Look deep within yourself,
Clarice Starling.

172
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,829
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

173
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,954
I don't think Miggs could manage again
so soon, even though he is crazy. Go!

174
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,116
Hey, Bill.

175
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,155
- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.

176
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,594
- Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?
- No, angel. They all got away today.

177
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,270
FBI. Hands up. Don't move.

178
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,188
Turn around.
Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

179
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,835
You're dead, Starling.

180
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,919
Johnson, good entry, good command.
Starling, where's your danger area?

181
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,393
- The corner.
- Did you check?

182
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,158
- No.
- That's why you're dead.

183
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,431
3109.

184
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,677
3109. Breaking doors or windows

185
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,519
to enter or exit.

186
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,959
Rule 404.

187
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,073
- Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
- Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

188
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,914
- Starling?
- Sir?

189
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,349
Miggs is dead.

190
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,152
Dead?

191
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,679
How?

192
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,190
They heard Lecter whispering to him
all afternoon and Miggs crying.

193
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,313
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

194
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,917
- Starling?
- Yeah. I'm still here, sir.

195
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,077
I just... I don't know how to feel about this.

196
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,997
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

197
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,638
Look, I know it got ugly today, but
you mentioned a name at the end: Mofet.

198
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,115
Any follow-up on her?

199
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,391
Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories,

200
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,876
so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet, but

201
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,073
I thought the ''yourself'' reference
was too hokey for Lecter,

202
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,079
so I figured he's from Baltimore
and I looked in the phone book

203
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,957
and there's a ''Your Self'' storage facility
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

204
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,752
Unit 31 was leased for ten years,
pre-paid in full.

205
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,670
The contract is in the name
of a Miss Hester Mofet.

206
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,274
So nobody's been in here since 1990?

207
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,595
Not to my knowledge.

208
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,349
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

209
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,631
Yes. I won't disturb anything, I promise.
I'll be outta here before you know it.

210
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,955
- May I help you?
- Yes, actually.

211
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,993
- It's stuck.
- We could return tomorrow with my son.

212
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,793
What about him?

213
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,516
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labour.

214
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,234
Right. Well, you just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

215
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,111
It's stuck. Hand me that flashlight, sir.

216
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,153
If this door should fall down
or anything else,

217
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,518
this is the number for
our Baltimore field office.

218
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,394
Now they know that you're with me.
Call them if anything should happen.

219
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,875
Yes, Miss Starling.

220
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,555
Clarice. They're waiting for you.
Watch your step.

221
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,073
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram,
isn't it, Doctor?

222
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,192
Hester Mofet. ''The rest of me.''

223
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,553
''Miss the rest of me.''
Meaning that you rented that garage?

224
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,156
- Thank you.
- Your bleeding has stopped.

225
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,476
How did you...?

226
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,194
It's nothing. It was just a scratch.

227
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,355
Dr Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

228
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,597
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

229
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,679
- Do you know something about him?
- I might if I saw the case file.

230
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,236
- You could get that for me.
- Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?

231
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,555
You wanted me to find him.

232
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,879
His real name is Benjamin Raspail,
a former patient of mine,

233
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,391
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.

234
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,919
I did not kill him, merely tucked him
away very much as I found him,

235
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,555
after he'd missed three appointments.

236
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,879
- If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?
- Who can say? Best thing for him, really.

237
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,309
His therapy was going nowhere.

238
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,354
His dress, make-up...

239
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,153
- Raspail was a transvestite?
- In life? Oh, no.

240
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,956
Garden-variety manic-depressive.
Tedious, very tedious.

241
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,435
I now just think of him
as a kind of experiment.

242
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,030
A fledgling killer's
first effort at transformation.

243
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,913
How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?

244
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,438
Scared at first, then exhilarated.

245
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,517
Jack Crawford is helping your career.
Apparently he likes you and you like him.

246
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,596
I never thought about it.

247
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,393
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you, sexually?

248
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,514
True, he is much older, but do you think
he visualises scenarios, exchanges,

249
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,995
fucking you?

250
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,471
That doesn't interest me and, frankly,
it's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.

251
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,915
Not any more.

252
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,715
Thank you, Barney.

253
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,115
What happened to your drawings?

254
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,352
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel programme.

255
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,358
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

256
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,677
Dr Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

257
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,830
What did you mean
by ''transformation'', Doctor?

258
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,756
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

259
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,793
I know they will never ever
let me out while I'm alive.

260
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,036
What I want is a view.

261
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,869
I want a window where I can
see a tree, or even water.

262
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,356
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr Chilton.

263
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,951
What did you mean by ''fledgling killer''?
Are you saying that he's killed again?

264
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,552
I'm offering you a psychological profile of
Buffalo Bill, based on the case evidence.

265
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,875
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

266
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,436
You know who he is, don't you?

267
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,754
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

268
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,792
All good things to those who wait.

269
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,152
I've waited, Clarice, but how long
can you and old Jackie Boy wait?

270
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,674
Our little Billy must already be
searching for that next special lady.

271
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,869
MEMPHIS, TN

272
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,276
Hey, little cheeper.

273
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,311
I'll be right there.

274
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,596
Can I help you with that?

275
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,236
- Would you?
- Sure.

276
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,993
- Thank you.
- You look kinda handicapped.

277
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,477
Yeah. I got it this far. I just can't
get it up in the truck by myself.

278
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,717
- Here. Grab this.
- OK.

279
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,229
Just set it down. That's good.

280
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,239
Get in the truck.
I wanna push it all the way up.

281
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,796
I really appreciate this.
Thank you. Thank you.

282
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,196
Push it all the way back.

283
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,836
- Is this good?
- Yeah.

284
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,554
- That's great.
- OK.

285
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,114
Say, are you about a size 14?

286
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,196
Sorry?

287
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,636
Good.

288
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,396
Oh, good.

289
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,473
Good.

290
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,276
Starling!

291
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,036
Outside. Let's go.

292
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,395
Cindy. In the ring for Starling. Let's go.

293
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,478
FBI!

294
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,068
Pack your field gear.
You're going with Crawford.

295
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,270
- Where?
- They found a girl's body.

296
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,153
Been in the water a week.
It's a Buffalo Bill situation.

297
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,198
CLAY COUNTY, W VA

298
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,638
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

299
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,672
No evidence of rape
or physical abuse prior to death.

300
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,951
All the mutilation
you see there is postmortem.

301
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,992
OK, three days. Then he shoots them,

302
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,318
skins them and dumps them,
each body in a different river.

303
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,398
The water leaves us
no trace evidence of any kind.

304
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,875
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

305
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,912
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

306
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,793
so actually she was the third girl found.

307
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,832
After her, he got lazy.

308
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,435
OK, let's see.

309
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,032
Circles where the girls were abducted.
Arrows where their bodies were found.

310
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,711
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia.

311
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,229
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

312
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:39,480
He's a white male. Serial killers tend
to hunt within their own ethnic groups.

313
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,116
He's not a drifter. He's got his own
house somewhere, not an apartment.

314
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,471
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.

315
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,957
He's in his thirties or forties.
He's got real physical strength,

316
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,674
combined with
an older man's self-control.

317
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,870
He's cautious, precise...

318
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,878
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

319
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,594
Why not?

320
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,918
Got a real taste for it now
and he's getting better at his work.

321
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,400
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

322
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,790
Yes, sir. You haven't mentioned anything
about the information in my report

323
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,990
or Dr Lecter's offer, sir.

324
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,636
- I'm considering it.
- That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

325
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,558
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

326
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,153
Well, if that was the case, then
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.

327
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,439
If I'd sent you in with an actual agenda,
Lecter would have known it instantly.

328
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,155
He would have toyed with you
then turned to stone.

329
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,357
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins.
These are the FBI people.

330
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,393
Sheriff Perkins - Jack Crawford, FBI.
Special Agent Terry.

331
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,069
Agent Starling. We appreciate
being invited into your jurisdiction.

332
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,510
I didn't call you. That was
the state attorney's office.

333
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,599
- We'll extend you every courtesy, but...
- Sheriff.

334
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,430
This type of sex crime has certain aspects
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

335
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,516
Know what I mean?

336
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,630
- Oscar, fetch Dr Akins from the chapel.
- Starling, we're back here.

337
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,991
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.

338
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,237
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

339
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,234
I need a six-way linkup.

340
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,351
Chicago, Detroit...

341
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,436
What?

342
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,829
Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen.
You officers and gentlemen,

343
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,554
listen here now.
There's things we need to do for her.

344
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,117
I know that y'all brought her this far and
her folks would thank you if they could

345
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,390
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

346
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,717
But now please go on now
and let us take care of her.

347
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,556
Go on now.

348
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,796
Thank you.

349
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,517
Thank you.

350
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,636
OK, good.

351
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,520
Yeah, that's right. Elk River.

352
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,995
Stand by for transmission.

353
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,236
Ray.

354
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,511
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

355
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,396
OK, Starling.

356
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,676
Bill.

357
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,598
Star-shaped contact entrance wound
over the sternum.

358
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,636
A muzzle stamp at the top.

359
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,830
Wrongful death.

360
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,236
She'll have to go to
the state pathologist at Claxton.

361
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,399
Well, I'd better get back to that service.
Lamar'll help you.

362
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,476
Lord Almighty.

363
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,278
What else do you see, Starling?

364
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,755
Well, she's not local.

365
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,874
Her ears are pierced three times
and there's glitter nail polish.

366
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,355
That looks like town to me.

367
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,152
Two of her fingernails are broken off
and there's dirt or grit under them.

368
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,636
It looks like she's tried
to claw her way through something.

369
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,231
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax 'em for Missing Persons.

370
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,076
Let's do another.

371
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,833
She's got something in her throat.

372
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,636
When a body comes out of the water,
lots of times there's leaves in the mouth.

373
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,633
What is that? Some kind of seed pod?

374
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,549
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

375
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,834
There's no way that could
get way down in there.

376
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,758
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

377
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,395
She'll be easier to print when we turn
her over. Lamar, give me a hand.

378
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,476
Yes, sir. I will.

379
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:00,752
- Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?
- Different configuration than the others.

380
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,440
- Get close-ups.
- The victim's skin removed,

381
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,950
this time in two large diamond-shaped
sections above the buttocks.

382
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,516
Exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae,

383
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,108
six inches from the right shoulder blade.

384
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,758
Starling, when I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

385
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,836
that really burned you, didn't it?

386
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,396
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

387
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,638
It matters, Mr Crawford.
Cops look at you to see how to act.

388
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,115
- It matters.
- Point taken.

389
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,194
Ligature marks found around the wrists,
not around the ankles.

390
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,199
This would indicate that
the skinning was postmortem.

391
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,833
- Time, Pilch. My move.
- You lured him with produce.

392
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,316
Tough noogies. It's still my turn.

393
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,635
Nice and slow, baby.

394
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,514
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

395
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,635
Course it counts. How do you play?

396
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,476
Agent Starling?

397
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,070
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.

398
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,512
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim in the Elk River.

399
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,598
- It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?
- I can't tell you any more.

400
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,156
- We heard about it on the radio.
- This is a clue from a real murder case?

401
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,795
- Cool.
- Just ignore him. He's not a PhD.

402
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,033
Sphingid ceratomia, maybe.

403
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,799
Boy, he's a big sucker.

404
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,590
OK. Let's check morphology.

405
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,912
What do you do when you're
not detecting, Agent Starling?

406
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,395
I try to be a student, Dr Pilcher.

407
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,077
Ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?

408
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,316
The amusing house wine?

409
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,870
Are you hitting on me, Doctor?

410
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,035
Yes.

411
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,878
- Gotcha.
- What have you got?

412
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,710
Agent Starling, meet Mr Acherontia styx.

413
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,155
Weird.

414
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,352
Better known to his friends
as the death's-head moth.

415
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,473
- Where does it come from?
- It's strange. They only live in Asia.

416
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,319
Here they'd have to be
raised from imported eggs.

417
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,197
Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey
and nightshade, kept him warm.

418
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,788
Somebody loved him.

419
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,756
Where are you?

420
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,636
Let me outta here!

421
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,516
Help me!

422
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,676
Please!

423
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,156
Please help me.

424
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,157
Please!

425
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,714
Why won't you answer me? Please!

426
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,757
- Good morning. I'm Donna Feruchi.
- I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

427
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,111
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.:

428
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,949
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

429
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,277
listed as missing, is now
believed to have been kidnapped

430
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,153
by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.

431
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,670
Police indicate that the girl's
blouse has been identified,

432
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,237
sliced up the back, in what has become
a grim, all-too-familiar calling card.

433
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,989
Young Catherine Martin is the only
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

434
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,270
the Republican senator from Tennessee.

435
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,710
Her kidnapping is not considered
to be politically motivated,

436
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,877
but it has stirred
the government to its highest levels.

437
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,357
Reached for comment on the ski slopes
of Vermont, the president is said to be,

438
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,596
and I quote, ''intensely concerned''.

439
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,111
Just moments ago Senator Martin
taped this dramatic personal plea.

440
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,518
I'm speaking now to the person
who is holding my daughter.

441
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,918
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

442
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,155
Talk to her and you'll see.

443
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,158
You have the power. You are in charge.

444
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,551
I know you can feel love and compassion.

445
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,635
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

446
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,150
that you can be merciful
as well as strong,

447
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:07,308
that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.

448
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,431
You have that power.

449
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,551
Please.

450
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,557
My daughter is Catherine.

451
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,355
Boy, that's smart.
Jesus, that's really smart.

452
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,630
She keeps repeating the name.

453
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,437
If he sees Catherine as a person and not
just an object, it's harder to tear her up.

454
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,869
Release my little girl.

455
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,390
You're coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

456
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,274
and refusing to share information
with me for the third time.

457
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,518
Sir, I told you, this is just a routine
follow-up on the Raspail case.

458
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,996
- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.

459
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:47,477
Look, I am not just
some turnkey, Miss Starling.

460
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,438
This is the number
for the US attorney's office.

461
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,680
Either you discuss this with him or you
let me do my job, do you understand?

462
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:06,389
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill
in time to save Catherine Martin,

463
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,875
the senator promises you a transfer

464
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,073
to the VA hospital at Oneida Park, New
York, with a view of the woods nearby.

465
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,078
Maximum security still applies, of course.

466
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,351
You'd have reasonable access to books.

467
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,630
Best of all, though,

468
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,719
one week of the year,
you get to leave the hospital

469
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,796
and go here.

470
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,113
Plum Island.

471
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,756
Every day of that week you may walk on
the beach, you may swim in the ocean,

472
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,351
for up to one hour, under SWAT team
surveillance, of course.

473
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,395
And there you have it.

474
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,796
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

475
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,595
A copy of the senator's offer.

476
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,474
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

477
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,558
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

478
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,270
''Plum Island Animal Disease
Research Centre.''

479
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,110
Sounds charming.

480
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,710
That's only a part of the island.
There's a very nice beach.

481
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,310
- Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
- Terns?

482
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,237
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be ''turns'' with us too.

483
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,318
Quid pro quo. I tell you things,
you tell me things.

484
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,079
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

485
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,112
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

486
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,910
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

487
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,275
Go, Doctor.

488
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,039
What is your worst memory of childhood?

489
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,275
The death of my father.

490
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,312
Tell me about it and don't lie, or I'll know.

491
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,316
He was a town marshal.

492
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,672
One night he surprised two burglars

493
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,155
coming out the back of a drugstore.

494
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,316
They shot him.

495
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,510
Was he killed outright?

496
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,428
No, he was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

497
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,433
My mother died when I was very young.

498
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,397
My father had become the whole world to
me, and, when he left me, I had nothing.

499
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,670
I was ten years old.

500
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,993
You're very frank, Clarice.

501
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:38,750
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

502
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,073
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

503
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,591
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

504
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,551
- Yes.
- Big through the hips? Roomy?

505
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,752
- They all were.
- What else?

506
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,759
She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat.

507
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,192
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

508
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,153
Was it a butterfly?

509
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,236
Yes. A moth.

510
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:16,678
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

511
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,519
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

512
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,428
The significance of the moth is change.

513
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,870
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa,

514
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,833
and from thence into beauty.

515
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,793
Our Billy wants to change, too.

516
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,512
There's no correlation between
transsexualism and violence.

517
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,757
- Transsexuals are very passive.
- Clever girl.

518
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,395
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him, do you realise that?

519
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,909
No. Tell me why.

520
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:50,795
After your father's murder you were
orphaned. What happened next?

521
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,791
I don't imagine the answer is
on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

522
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,278
I lived with my mother's cousin and her
husband in Montana. They had a ranch.

523
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,710
- Was it a cattle ranch?
- Sheep and horses.

524
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,476
- How long did you live there?
- Two months.

525
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,912
- Why so briefly?
- I ran away.

526
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,828
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher
make you perform fellatio?

527
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,394
Did he sodomise you?

528
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,876
No. He was a very decent man.

529
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,515
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

530
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,317
Billy is not a real transsexual.
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

531
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,477
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

532
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,275
You said that I was very close to the way
we would catch him. What did you mean?

533
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,790
There are three centres for
transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins,

534
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,196
the University of Minnesota
and Columbus Medical Centre.

535
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:51,916
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy had applied
for sex reassignment at all of them

536
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,315
and been rejected.

537
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,034
On what basis would they reject him?

538
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,517
Look for severe childhood disturbances
associated with violence.

539
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,473
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.

540
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,593
He was made one through years
of systematic abuse.

541
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,996
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

542
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,793
and he thinks
that makes him a transsexual.

543
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,754
But his pathology is
a thousand times more savage

544
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,235
and more terrifying.

545
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,312
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

546
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:34,038
Mister, my family'll pay cash. Whatever
ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.

547
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,551
It rubs the lotion on its skin
or else it gets the hose again.

548
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,831
Yes, it will, Precious. It will get the hose.

549
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,916
OK, OK.

550
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,755
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges, I promise.

551
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,429
See, my mom is a real important woman.

552
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,676
I guess you already know that.

553
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,872
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

554
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,353
Please!

555
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,876
Please!

556
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,791
I wanna go home, please!

557
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,150
It places the lotion in the basket.

558
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,036
I wanna see my mommy!

559
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,599
Please!

560
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,676
I wanna see my...

561
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,916
I wanna see my mommy.

562
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,955
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

563
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,228
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

564
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,874
I don't think so.

565
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,389
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

566
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,080
She never heard of any deal with you.

567
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,480
They scammed you, Hannibal.

568
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,035
Stand outside.

569
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,636
And shut the door.

570
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,718
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.

571
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,755
I designed it. Of course, I worked in a few
conditions for my own benefit as well.

572
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,034
Identify Buffalo Bill by name
and, if the girl is found in time,

573
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,359
Senator Martin will have you transferred
to the state prison in Tennessee.

574
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,153
Answer me, Hannibal.

575
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,591
You answer me now or, by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

576
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,396
Who is Buffalo Bill?

577
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,795
His first name is Louis.

578
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,196
I'll tell the rest to the senator herself,
but only in Tennessee.

579
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,073
And I have a few conditions of my own.

580
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,471
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

581
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,551
Jack, Hannibal Lecter's
being transferred to Memphis.

582
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,954
Transferred?

583
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,358
Did you have a trainee make a phoney
offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

584
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,516
Yeah, I rolled the dice. I had to.

585
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,553
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

586
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,478
She's asking him
to take over in Memphis.

587
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,275
MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

588
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,557
Welcome to Memphis. I'm Lieutenant
Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.

589
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,671
We'll treat you as good as you treat us.

590
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,793
You be a gentleman, you're gonna
get three hots and a cot.

591
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,799
Sir. You sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

592
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,639
Where's...?

593
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,676
Here, sir. Use mine.

594
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,434
Senator Martin, Dr Hannibal Lecter.

595
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,758
Dr Lecter, I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

596
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,792
You'll wanna read it before I sign.

597
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,078
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time, bargaining for petty privileges.

598
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,318
Clarice Starling and that awful Jack
Crawford have wasted far too much time.

599
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,750
I only pray they haven't
doomed the poor girl.

600
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,836
Let me help you now and I will
trust you when it is all over.

601
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,315
You have my word. Paul?

602
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,834
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

603
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,988
I met him just once. He was referred
to me in April or May 1990

604
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,793
by my patient, Benjamin Raspail.

605
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,990
They were lovers, you see.

606
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:06,033
But Raspail had become very frightened.

607
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,470
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient

608
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,717
and done things with the skin.

609
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,389
We need his address
and a physical description.

610
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:22,036
Tell me, Senator. Did you
nurse Catherine yourself?

611
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,750
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

612
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,440
- Now, wait a minute.
- Yes, I did.

613
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,275
- Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
- You son of a bitch!

614
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,029
Amputate a man's leg
and he can still feel it tickling.

615
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:40,029
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl
is on the slab, where will it tickle you?

616
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,752
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

617
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,958
Five foot ten, strongly built,
about 190 pounds.

618
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,640
Hair blond, eyes pale blue.

619
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,992
He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived
in Philadelphia but may have lied.

620
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:00,831
That's all I can remember, Mom, but if
I think of any more, I will let you know.

621
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,230
And, Senator, just one more thing.

622
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,954
Love your suit.

623
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,437
In a meeting this evening
with Senator Ruth Martin,

624
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,552
Dr Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation

625
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,513
of trying to find the abductor, Buffalo Bill.

626
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,279
- How do you fit in?
- My insight into Lecter's mind

627
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,710
- made this breakthrough possible.
- Buffalo Bill's real name?

628
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,196
That is now a matter of record
with the proper authorities.

629
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,915
- My name is Dr Frederick Chilton.
- How do you spell that?

630
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:39,071
- Are you with Dr Chilton's group?
- Well, I just saw him outside, sir.

631
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,476
Access to Lecter is limited.
We've been getting death threats.

632
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,955
I understand, sir.

633
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,435
Log in and check your weapon.

634
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,754
I can't take all the credit.
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,

635
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,792
people at the FBI, folks
at the Baltimore state hospital.

636
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,151
And now for the hard part:
apprehending the suspect.

637
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,750
Excuse me, folks.
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.

638
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,991
Is it true what they're sayin'?

639
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,910
He's some kind of vampire?

640
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,032
They don't have a name for what he is.

641
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,469
You do know the rules, ma'am?

642
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,229
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

643
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,236
Go ahead.

644
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,150
Good evening, Clarice.

645
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,234
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

646
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,154
Just until you get your view.

647
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,840
How very thoughtful.

648
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,073
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle

649
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,714
before you're both booted off the case?

650
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,479
No, I came because I wanted to.

651
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,709
People will say we're in love.

652
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,154
Anthrax Island.

653
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,238
That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.

654
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,999
- Yours?
- Yes.

655
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,190
Yeah.

656
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,949
That was good.
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

657
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,594
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

658
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,792
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

659
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,956
Louis Friend?

660
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,072
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

661
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,234
Oh, Clarice, your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

662
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,555
You were telling me the truth back in
Baltimore, sir. Please continue now.

663
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,353
I've read the case files. Have you?

664
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,392
Everything you need to find him
is there in those pages.

665
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:34,116
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.

666
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:39,155
Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each
particular thing, ask what is it in itself?

667
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,271
What is its nature?

668
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,154
What does he do, this man you seek?

669
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,798
- He kills women.
- No. That is incidental.

670
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:56,675
What is the first thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?

671
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,156
Anger.

672
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,956
Social acceptance.

673
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,432
- Sexual frustrations.
- No. He covets.

674
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:12,512
That is his nature.
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

675
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,158
Do we seek out things to covet?

676
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,236
Make an effort to answer now.

677
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,874
No. We just...

678
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,197
No, we begin by coveting
what we see every day.

679
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,471
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

680
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,431
And don't your eyes seek out
the things you want?

681
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,668
All right, yes. Now please tell me how...

682
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,509
No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

683
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,677
You don't have any more
vacations to sell.

684
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,314
Why did you leave that ranch?

685
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:48,433
Doctor, we don't have
any more time for any of this now.

686
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,028
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we?

687
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:55,312
- This is all the time you'll ever have.
- Later. Listen to me. We've only got five...

688
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,637
No. I will listen now.

689
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,678
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

690
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,349
You went to live with cousins on
a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

691
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,436
And?

692
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,716
And one morning I just ran away.

693
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,916
Not ''just'', Clarice. What set you off?

694
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,510
- You started at what time?
- Early. Still dark.

695
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,428
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?

696
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,594
I heard a strange noise.

697
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,631
What was it?

698
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,832
It was screaming.

699
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,952
Some kind of screaming.
Like a child's voice.

700
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,957
What did you do?

701
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,594
I went downstairs.

702
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,676
Outside.

703
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,719
I crept up into the barn.

704
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:53,549
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

705
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,151
What did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

706
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,830
Lambs.

707
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,951
They were screaming.

708
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,719
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

709
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,032
And they were screaming.

710
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:13,836
- And you ran away?
- No. First I tried to free them.

711
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,555
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

712
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:21,229
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

713
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,272
But you could - and you did, didn't you?

714
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,949
Yes. I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could.

715
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:32,198
- Where were you going, Clarice?
- I don't know. I didn't have any food,

716
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,471
any water and it was very cold, very cold.

717
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,471
I thought...

718
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,558
I thought if I could save just one, but...

719
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,388
He was so heavy.

720
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,476
So heavy.

721
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:57,676
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

722
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,596
The rancher was so angry, he sent me
to live at the orphanage in Bozeman.

723
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,870
I never saw the ranch again.

724
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,914
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

725
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,469
- He killed him.
- You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

726
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,989
Wake up in the dark

727
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,759
and hear the screaming of the lambs?

728
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,276
Yes.

729
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,959
And you think, if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

730
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,150
You think if Catherine lives,

731
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,511
you won't wake up in the dark ever again

732
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,359
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

733
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,833
I don't know.

734
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,277
I don't know.

735
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,316
Thank you, Clarice.

736
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:49,238
- Thank you.
- Tell me his name, Doctor.

737
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,793
Dr Chilton, I presume.

738
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,275
I think you know each other.

739
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,636
OK.

740
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,790
- Let's go.
- It's your turn, Doctor.

741
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,911
- Out.
- Tell me his name.

742
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,999
Sorry, ma'am. I've got orders. I have
to put you on a plane. Come on now.

743
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,315
Brave Clarice.

744
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,876
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

745
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,357
- Tell me his name, Doctor.
- Clarice.

746
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,074
Your case file.

747
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,719
Goodbye, Clarice.

748
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,679
- Ready when you are, doc.
- Just another minute, please.

749
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:52,797
Son of a bitch demanded a second
dinner. Lamb chops, extra rare.

750
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,550
I wonder what he wants for breakfast.
Some damn thing from the zoo?

751
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,515
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- OK, doc. Grab some floor.

752
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,596
Same drill as before, please.

753
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,833
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

754
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,156
OK.

755
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,836
Hand me that, would ya?

756
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,876
Thanks.

757
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,393
Mind the drawings, please.

758
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,476
Thank you.

759
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,754
Watch it. He's cuffed me!

760
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,996
Jesus Christ!

761
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,713
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

762
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,471
What is this shit?

763
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,355
- Did somebody go up on five?
- No. Nobody went up.

764
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,472
Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...

765
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,913
CP. Shots fired on five.
Repeat: shots fired on five.

766
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,996
Sergeant Tate.

767
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,514
- Holy shit.
- What the hell...?

768
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,188
Shut up. Bobby, get the vest.

769
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,039
- Right, sarge.
- Brady, Howard, cover...

770
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,116
Look!

771
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,278
- It's stopped.
- Seal off a ten-block radius.

772
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,039
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.

773
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,037
We're goin' up.

774
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,311
Pembry!

775
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,196
Boyle!

776
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,270
Oh, God.

777
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,156
Go.

778
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,832
- Clear.
- Command post.

779
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,315
Two officers down.

780
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,672
- Lecter's gone, sarge.
- Prisoner is missing.

781
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,078
- Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.
- Repeat: Lecter is missing and armed.

782
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:16,398
He's stripped the bed. Might be
makin' a rope. Check all windows.

783
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,309
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

784
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,959
He's alive. Sergeant Tate, he's alive.

785
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:27,716
Get a hold of him
and feel his hand. Talk to him.

786
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,469
- What do I say?
- It's Jim Pembry. Talk to him, dammit!

787
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,796
Lecter is missing and armed.

788
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,036
Pembry, can you hear me?

789
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:41,870
He took Boyle's gun. Pembry got off one
round. There's a chance Lecter was hit.

790
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,675
Keep breathin' in and out.
That's it. You're doing a good job.

791
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,075
You look real good.

792
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,953
Yeah, you look real good.

793
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,037
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

794
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,116
Let's go.

795
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,993
Looking good, Pembry. You're gonna
make it. You're doin' just fine.

796
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,429
I need that IV now!

797
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:31,473
Can we get the straps?
Where's the fucking oxygen?

798
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,955
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

799
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,315
We're losin' him. Downstairs.

800
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,388
And up.

801
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,476
Elevator!

802
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,592
CP to Tate.

803
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,473
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

804
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,433
I'm on the elevator
bringing Pembry down.

805
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,949
He seems to be hangin' on.

806
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,469
Top three floors secured.

807
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,556
Main stairwell secured.

808
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,516
We think he's on two.

809
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,355
Tate, are you still with me?

810
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,948
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two,
sir. That's all for now. Over.

811
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,235
He's on the roof of the elevator.

812
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,671
OK, guys.

813
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,439
I see him.

814
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,755
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

815
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,239
- One warning: we need him alive.
- Got it.

816
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,993
Lecter, put your hands on your head.

817
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,796
One in the leg.

818
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,950
No movement.

819
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,512
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're comin' into the car.

820
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,835
We're openin' the hatch.

821
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,032
Watch his hands.
If there's any fire, it'll come from us.

822
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,151
- Affirm.
- Got it.

823
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,156
Memphis General, medical unit 26.

824
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:17,512
We're inbound with a male police officer
with severe facial lacerations.

825
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:22,077
Weapon unknown. We've got grand mal
seizure activity but he's post-ictal now.

826
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,033
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

827
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,469
- 90?
- Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse 94.

828
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,355
We got him on lactated Ringer's and
the patient is on ten litres of oxygen...

829
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:44,113
They found the ambulance in a parking
garage at the airport. Crew was dead.

830
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,155
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.

831
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,677
- By now he could be anywhere.
- He won't come after me.

832
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,995
- Oh, really?
- He won't.

833
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:58,477
I can't explain it.
He would consider that rude.

834
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:02,309
- It's over. She's dead.
- It's not your fault it worked out like this.

835
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:06,672
The thing is that Lecter said everything
we need to catch him is in these pages.

836
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,189
Dr Lecter said a lot of things.

837
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,675
He's here, Ardelia.

838
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,395
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

839
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:47,032
''Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random,

840
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,835
like the elaboration of a bad liar?
Hannibal Lecter.''

841
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,554
Desperately random?
What does he mean?

842
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,992
Not random at all, maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

843
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:01,192
But there is no pattern
or the computers would have nailed it.

844
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:05,757
- They were even found in random order.
- Random because of the one girl.

845
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:09,714
- The one he weighted down.
- Fredrica Bimmel.

846
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:13,077
From Belvedere, Ohio.

847
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,033
First girl taken, third body found.

848
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,958
- Why?
- She didn't drift. He weighted her down.

849
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:22,311
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

850
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:27,389
- Simplicity.
- What does this guy do? He covets.

851
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,954
How do we first start to covet?

852
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,596
- We covet what we see...
- Every day.

853
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,591
- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.

854
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:46,629
BELVEDERE, OHIO

855
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,596
- Mr Bimmel?
- That's me.

856
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,188
I'm Clarice Starling. I'm with the FBI.

857
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,396
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr Bimmel.

858
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,670
I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.

859
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:09,076
Police been back here
so many times already.

860
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:13,193
Fredrica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

861
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:16,710
She left the interview OK.
She never come home.

862
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,789
Her bedroom's how she left it.

863
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,434
Upstairs. Door to the left.

864
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:06,710
He's making himself a ''woman suit'',
Mr Crawford, out of real women.

865
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,274
He can sew, this guy. He's very skilled.

866
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,675
- He's a tailor or a dressmaker.
- Starling...

867
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,270
That's why they're so big. He has to
keep them alive so he can starve them,

868
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,915
- so that he can loosen their skin.
- Starling, we know who he is.

869
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,031
And where he is.
We're on our way right now.

870
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,993
- Where?
- Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

871
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,759
Be on the ground in 45 minutes.

872
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,996
That's great news, sir, but how...

873
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,556
Johns Hopkins came up with some
names. We fed 'em into Known Offenders.

874
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:36,593
Subject's name
is Jamie Gumb, a.k.a John Grant.

875
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,270
Lecter's description was accurate.
He just lied about the name.

876
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,550
Customs had some paper on him.

877
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:47,993
They stopped a carton two years ago
at LAX. Live caterpillars from Surinam.

878
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,918
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

879
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:54,233
Chicago's only 400 miles from here.
I'll be there in...

880
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:58,592
No, Starling. There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

881
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:02,599
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl.
See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.

882
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,836
Yes, sir, you bet. I'll do my best.

883
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,475
Starling, we wouldn't
have found him without you.

884
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:11,956
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.

885
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:16,875
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr Crawford.

886
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,433
Mr Crawford?

887
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,835
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

888
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,315
I got a better idea.

889
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,073
OK, Precious. Time for a little treat.

890
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,196
Precious!

891
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,474
Come on, girl!

892
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,989
Come on, Precious.

893
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,677
Come on, Precious!

894
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,873
I got a yummy snack for ya!
Come on. Come and get it.

895
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,630
Precious!

896
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,910
Are you up there, you little shit?

897
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,514
Come and get it, pretty girl.

898
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:59,395
Precious, please come. Come on.

899
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,599
Would you fuck me?

900
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,150
Come on. Take that bone.

901
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,788
I'd fuck me.

902
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,795
Come on.

903
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,596
I'd fuck me hard.

904
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,676
I'd fuck me so hard.

905
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,275
No.

906
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:33,592
AIR NATIONAL GUARD HQ
CHICAGO, IL

907
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:47,635
Is that a good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?

908
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,796
I mean, better places than this?

909
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,715
Sometimes you do.

910
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:58,072
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

911
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:02,079
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

912
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,873
She thought it was such hot shit.

913
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,355
What did she know? Big dummy.

914
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:13,191
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

915
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,155
- How about John Grant?
- No.

916
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,999
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know about?

917
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,270
If she had a guy,
I'd have known, believe me.

918
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:25,154
- Sewing was her life.
- Did you two ever work together?

919
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:30,229
Sure. Me and Pam Malavesi used to help
her do alterations for old Mrs Lippman.

920
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:33,830
Can you give me Mrs Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

921
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,869
CALUMET CITY, IL

922
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,678
So powerful. So beautiful.

923
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,956
Precious?

924
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:19,111
- Precious?
- She's down here, you sack of shit!

925
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,878
- Put her in that bucket.
- Get me a telephone and lower it down.

926
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,230
Poodlie-poo. Precious.

927
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:41,751
- Darling heart, are you all right?
- She's in a lot of pain. She needs a vet.

928
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,752
She broke her leg
on the way down. I know it.

929
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:52,589
- Don't you hurt my dog!
- Don't you make me hurt your dog!

930
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:54,836
You don't know what pain is!

931
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,912
- Oh, fuck!
- You better be gettin' me that telephone!

932
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:14,595
I'm gonna do it, mister!

933
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,551
All right, mister! I'm doin' it!

934
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,876
OK, I'm coming.

935
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,596
We're goin' in.

936
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:57,156
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for Mrs Lippman's family.

937
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:00,268
FBI! Everybody down!

938
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,868
No, Lippmans don't live here any more.

939
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,150
Excuse me.
I really need to speak with you.

940
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,992
Clear!

941
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,756
What's the problem, officer?

942
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,519
I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

943
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,315
There's no one here, Jack.

944
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:21,989
Clarice.

945
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:24,759
- Your name is?
- Jack Gordon.

946
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:29,829
Mr Gordon. Good. Well, Fredrica used to
work for Mrs Lippman. Did you know her?

947
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,791
No. Uh-uh.

948
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,512
Oh, wait.

949
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,710
Was she a great, big, fat person?

950
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,876
- She was a big girl, sir.
- Yeah, I may have...

951
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,389
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

952
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,714
Mrs Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

953
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,673
I got his card here someplace.
Come in while I look for it.

954
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,155
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

955
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:14,636
Are you close to catchin'
somebody, you think?

956
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,716
Yes. We may be.

957
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,869
Did you take over this place
after Mrs Lippman died, is that right?

958
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:29,952
Yeah, I bought this house two years ago.

959
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:34,430
Did she leave any records?
Any business records?

960
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,711
Tax forms? List of employees?

961
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:41,035
No, nothin' like that at all.

962
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,718
Say, has the FBI learned something?

963
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:49,515
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

964
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:03,951
I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

965
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,036
No.

966
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,516
No, we don't.

967
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,955
Here's that number.

968
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:26,229
Very good, Mr Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

969
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:35,996
Sure, you can use my phone.

970
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:40,312
Freeze! Put your hands over your head.

971
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,912
And turn around. Spread your legs.

972
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,437
Spread your legs.
Put your hands in the back. Thumbs up.

973
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:49,516
Freeze!

974
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,274
Hello? Are you there?

975
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:25,675
I'm down here!

976
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:47,240
- Catherine Martin?
- Yes!

977
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:52,119
FBI. You're safe.

978
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,595
Safe, shit! Get me outta here!

979
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:12,877
- You're all right. Where is he?
- How the fuck should I know?

980
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,959
- Just get me outta here!
- You gotta be quiet. Shut that dog up.

981
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,831
Just get me outta here!

982
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,796
Oh, my God.

983
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:28,393
Catherine, I'm gonna get you outta there,
but right now you listen to me.

984
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,670
I've gotta leave this room. Be right back.

985
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:34,475
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fuckin' bitch!

986
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:38,309
Don't you leave me here!
This guy's fuckin' crazy!

987
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,037
Please!

988
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,833
I gotta get outta here!

989
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:52,871
Catherine, the other officers'll
be here any minute now.

990
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,788
Wait! Don't go! Please!

991
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:58,114
Quiet!

992
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:52,078
- You OK?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm OK.

993
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,395
How did you track Buffalo Bill here?

994
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,476
Clarice M Starling.

995
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,156
Congratulations.

996
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:41,436
Special Agent Starling.

997
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:44,074
- Special Agent Mapp.
- Phone call.

998
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,156
- Excuse me.
- Starling.

999
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,355
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1000
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,436
Yeah. Sure.

1001
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:57,232
Look, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

1002
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,909
I'm not much good at this kinda thing,
so I'm gonna duck outta here.

1003
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,996
OK. Sure.

1004
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,275
Thank you, Mr Crawford.

1005
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,352
Your father would have been proud today.

1006
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:20,795
Don't forget your phone call.

1007
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:27,638
- Starling.
- Well, Clarice?

1008
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,555
Have the lambs stopped screaming?

1009
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,235
- Dr Lecter.
- Don't bother with the trace.

1010
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,157
I won't be on long enough.

1011
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,639
- Where are you, Dr Lecter?
- I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1012
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:45,593
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1013
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:48,632
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.

1014
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:51,115
You know I can't make that promise.

1015
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,835
I do wish we could chat longer but...

1016
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:57,953
I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1017
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,554
- Bye.
- Dr Lecter?

1018
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:06,396
Dr Lecter?

1019
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:16,793
Excuse me. You got
the security system all set up?

1020
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:20,959
- We have the big-shot security.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

1021
