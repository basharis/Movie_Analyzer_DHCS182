Juice by Tappy.

2
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:32,753
Juice by Tappy.

3
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:34,338
Juice by Tappy.

4
00:00:35,089 --> 00:00:37,050
That's got juice.

5
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:39,552
Oh, Tappy.

6
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,811
Juice by you.

7
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:49,772
Juice by you. Thank you.

8
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:55,821
We got a winner.
We got a winner.

9
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:57,364
We got a winner.

10
00:00:57,572 --> 00:00:58,448
We got a winner.

11
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:02,369
She's a flight attendant
from Washington, D.C.

12
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:05,038
Will you please welcome
Mary Kellington.

13
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:07,917
Juice by Mary!
Juice by Mary!

14
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:13,673
- Harold, please, not again the TV.
- Come on, ma.

15
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:17,261
Why make such a big deal of this?

16
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:19,430
You'll get the set back
in a couple of hours.

17
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:24,435
Why you gotta make me
feel so guilty, ma?

18
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:34,028
What are you trying to do?

19
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:36,323
Get me to break my mother's set?

20
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:37,575
Or the radiator?

21
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,618
Maybe blow up the house, ma?

22
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:40,703
Is that it?

23
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:42,747
Your own flesh and blood, ma?

24
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:45,041
Is that what you trying to do?

25
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,797
Why do you always play
games with my head?

26
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:52,466
I wouldn't do that.

27
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:58,055
The chain isn't for you.
It's for the robbers.

28
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:00,683
Why won't you come out?

29
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:08,233
See what I mean? See how
you always gotta upset me?

30
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,417
Ma?

31
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,802
C'mon out, please.

32
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:38,809
Screw it!

33
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:40,769
This isn't happening.

34
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:45,274
And if it were, it
would be alright.

35
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,821
Don't worry Seymour.
It'll all work out.

36
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:54,534
You'll see.
In the end it's all nice.

37
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,128
Shit, that mother fucker's
looking a little seedy, Jim.

38
00:03:04,712 --> 00:03:06,423
You particular all of a sudden?

39
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:10,969
Mother fucker could grow a beard,
as long as we get our braid.

40
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:13,138
Give me a hand, Tyrone.

41
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:23,190
Hello.

42
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,066
Hi.

43
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,747
Fuck, the table too.

44
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,252
What, you want me to
schlep it on my back?

45
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:35,587
You got a friend.

46
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,630
I ain't no lepers schlepper.

47
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,841
Such a son. A goniff.

48
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,719
Your mother needs you like
a moose needs a hat rack.

49
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,962
Sheeit, that's some
boss scag baby.

50
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:16,715
I mean dynamite.

51
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:18,884
Oh, man, something else.

52
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:26,601
Know what we need?

53
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:30,688
Get us a piece of this Brody shit

54
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:32,941
cut it up, and off it.

55
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:35,277
We could double our money.

56
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:36,862
We could buy a couple of pieces

57
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,948
and get some whole
other shit going on.

58
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:40,991
That would be righteous.

59
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:44,704
In no time at all, we'd
get a pound of pure...

60
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,706
straight from Sal the Geep.

61
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:51,503
That's what I'm talking
about, baby, no hassles.

62
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:55,800
How's it going?

63
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:57,176
What's up?

64
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:58,386
The usual?

65
00:06:58,678 --> 00:06:59,762
Yeah, sounds good.

66
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,343
Anything else?

67
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:39,764
Anything else?

68
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:44,312
No. Nothing.
I'm alright.

69
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:55,115
Good afternoon, Mrs. Goldfarb.

70
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:56,867
Good afternoon, Mr. Rabinowitz.

71
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:00,037
Although I'm not sure how good.
And you?

72
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,330
What can I say?

73
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:02,581
You want your TV?

74
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,958
Yes, if you don't mind.

75
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:09,547
Can I ask you a question?
You won't take it personal?

76
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,884
How many years we know each other?

77
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:14,512
Who's to count?

78
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:16,847
Why don't you tell the police?

79
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:20,184
They talk to Harry, he won't
be stealing no more the TV.

80
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,436
I couldn't do that.

81
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:26,650
Harold's my child.
He's all I have.

82
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,653
Thank you, Mr. Rabinowitz.

83
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,826
Join us in creating excellence.

84
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:40,581
<i>More passion for living than</i>
<i>you've ever imagines.</i>

85
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,168
<i>Be excited.</i>
<i>Be excited.</i>

86
00:08:43,627 --> 00:08:46,088
<i>Be excited.</i>
<i>Be excited.</i>

87
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:49,383
<i>Be excited.</i>
<i>Be excited.</i>

88
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:52,469
<i>Be excited.</i>
<i>Be excited.</i>

89
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:26,883
Hello? Who is it?

90
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:46,362
Now what?

91
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,556
Hello?

92
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:14,018
<i>Mrs. Sara Goldfarb?</i>

93
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:15,228
Me. Speaking.

94
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:17,897
<i>This is Lyle Russel</i>
<i>from Maylin and Block.</i>

95
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:19,816
I'm not interested.

96
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,651
<i>I'm not selling anything.</i>

97
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:25,489
<i>I just want to offer you a</i>
<i>chance to be on television.</i>

98
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:26,532
<i>Maylin and Block...</i>

99
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,407
Television?

100
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:30,994
<i>That's right, Mrs. Goldfarb.</i>
<i>Television. Congratulations.</i>

101
00:10:31,537 --> 00:10:32,956
I don't have any...

102
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:34,374
<i>I'm not looking for money.</i>

103
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:37,252
<i>I'm calling to tell you</i>
<i>you've already won.</i>

104
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:39,087
<i>We discover contestants...</i>

105
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:41,214
<i>America's favorite TV shows.</i>

106
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:44,510
<i>You've been chosen from</i>
<i>a long list of contestants.</i>

107
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,054
<i>Meaning you've already won.</i>

108
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:49,515
<i>Yes, Mrs. Goldfarb.</i>

109
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:53,019
I never thought I'd
be on television.

110
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:55,272
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>You, on television.</i>

111
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,774
<i>We'll send you all the</i>
<i>necessary information.</i>

112
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,819
<i>Goodbye, congratulations</i>
<i>and take care.</i>

113
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:12,065
<i>I don't get it. Why are you</i>
<i>so hard on your folks?</i>

114
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,901
<i>They give you everything.</i>

115
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,070
<i>They hook you up with</i>
<i>an apartment.</i>

116
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,530
<i>With a croaker shrink.</i>

117
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,907
<i>Which is great. It's just...</i>

118
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:26,413
<i>money is never what I</i>
<i>really wanted from them.</i>

119
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,625
<i>That's pretty much all I get.</i>

120
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,462
<i>Why don't you get away from them?</i>

121
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:34,798
<i>How am I going to do that?</i>

122
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:39,386
What about your clothes?

123
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:42,557
Your sketches are great.
Open up a store.

124
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:45,309
I can't.

125
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:46,727
Why not?

126
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:49,147
When will I have time
to hang with you?

127
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:05,290
Where's the party?

128
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,250
You're going to jump
out the window.

129
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:20,681
I got a great diet book.

130
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:15,141
Thought I'd catch
a little sun today.

131
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:17,476
Really? In a box you'll catch it.

132
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:22,065
Relax and think how gorgeous
you'll be with new red hair.

133
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:26,487
Today the hair, tomorrow the sun.

134
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:30,282
Anybody want to waste some time?

135
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,665
<i>Angel says we should do it now.</i>

136
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:39,292
<i>I'll call Brody tomorrow.</i>

137
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:40,376
<i>Who's Brody?</i>

138
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:43,631
<i>My connection. He's</i>
<i>got unbelievable shit.</i>

139
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:45,049
<i>Shit, righteous.</i>

140
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:47,301
<i>We got this idea.</i>

141
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:48,844
<i>What is it?</i>

142
00:15:49,094 --> 00:15:52,015
<i>We cut this stuff up</i>
<i>and double our money.</i>

143
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:56,061
<i>Get a pound of pure and retire.</i>
<i>Know what that means?</i>

144
00:15:56,645 --> 00:16:00,565
<i>We get off hard knocks</i>
<i>and be on easy street.</i>

145
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:04,237
What's the catch?

146
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:07,990
That's red. I mean that's a red.

147
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:11,954
It's not a red red,
but that's a red.

148
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:12,913
Red?

149
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,956
Yeah.

150
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,666
You're telling me that's a red?

151
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,084
I'm telling. It's red.

152
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:21,548
Then what's orange?
I want to know what's orange.

153
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:29,222
Well, it could be...

154
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,394
it's a little orange too.

155
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,023
You know something?

156
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:48,952
I always thought you're the most
beautiful girl I've ever seen.

157
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:51,372
Really?

158
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:58,462
Ever since I first saw you.

159
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,508
That's nice, Harry.

160
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:10,017
That makes me feel good.

161
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:16,357
Others told me that before...

162
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:19,068
and it was meaningless.

163
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,540
Why? Thought they were
pulling your leg?

164
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,793
No, nothing like that.

165
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:38,298
I don't know or even
care if they were.

166
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:41,093
<i>From them it was...</i>

167
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:44,931
meaningless.

168
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:49,560
When you say it, I hear it.

169
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:54,858
I really hear it.

170
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:04,702
Someone like you could make
things alright for me.

171
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:07,580
You think?

172
00:18:11,418 --> 00:18:12,586
What is it?

173
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:14,964
Remember I told you
about the store?

174
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:16,757
Yeah.

175
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:22,222
I've been thinking.
I put together some numbers...

176
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,767
and it's not impossible.

177
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:30,773
You could and should do it.

178
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:33,568
We could do it together.

179
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:42,327
What do you think?

180
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:48,358
Stop already.

181
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:52,905
I felt better in a red
dress than a cheese Danish.

182
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:32,198
Three things is all I
did to change my life.

183
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:33,366
Three things.

184
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:35,618
No red meat.

185
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,329
Why do they stick in red meat?

186
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,125
I ate red meat to the
point where I'd...

187
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,503
eat it raw.
I loved my meat.

188
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,049
You need to be passionate.
No red meat.

189
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:52,554
No red meat for 30 days.

190
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:56,725
Three things is all I
did to change my life.

191
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:10,699
Ada told us. It's gorgeous.

192
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:12,826
We'll make it a little
darker tomorrow.

193
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:13,702
Why darker?

194
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:15,120
To go with my red dress.

195
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,830
Now it's looking like Madonna.

196
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,290
This is not Madonna.

197
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:21,461
Neither is this, but
I'm going on a diet.

198
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:23,004
What diet are you on?

199
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:24,255
Eggs and grapefruit.

200
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:26,257
I was on that once. Lots of luck.

201
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:27,383
It's not so bad.

202
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:28,718
How long you been on it?

203
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:29,762
All day.

204
00:21:30,012 --> 00:21:31,764
All day? It's one o'clock.

205
00:21:34,183 --> 00:21:35,184
I'm thinking thin.

206
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:36,602
She's thinking thin.

207
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:39,981
My Louise lost 50 lbs.
Just like that.

208
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:40,732
Like that?

209
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:41,900
Like what?

210
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,611
Did you put her in a sweat box?

211
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:49,325
She went to a doctor. With
pills, you don't want to eat.

212
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,369
What's so good about that?

213
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:52,495
I'm sitting here...

214
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:55,122
not thinking about chopped
liver and pastrami on rye?

215
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,459
You shouldn't talk like that
when someone's on a diet.

216
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,379
Oh, big deal.

217
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:01,922
I'll sneak more grapefruit.

218
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,592
I'm thinking thin.

219
00:22:05,842 --> 00:22:06,927
The mailman.

220
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:11,099
You have something
for Sara Goldfarb?

221
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:12,725
I'm expecting something.

222
00:22:13,017 --> 00:22:16,020
Goldfarb... Goldfarb...
Sara Goldfarb.

223
00:22:16,396 --> 00:22:18,731
This is it? That's it.

224
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:21,110
Wait, I got to get my stuff.

225
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:26,073
Okay, spell out your name.

226
00:22:26,824 --> 00:22:29,828
S-a-r-a G-o-l-d-

227
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:31,913
f-a-r-b.

228
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:35,333
Dynamite? Dynamite.

229
00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:40,840
Alright, we're on our way.

230
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:44,427
Says he got some real fine shit.

231
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:46,304
Alright, man.

232
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:48,431
Here we go.

233
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:52,603
Let's do this right.

234
00:22:53,103 --> 00:22:55,063
Come on, naturally.

235
00:22:58,442 --> 00:22:59,736
Come on, hurry.

236
00:23:00,862 --> 00:23:02,780
I wonder when you'll hear?

237
00:23:07,368 --> 00:23:09,455
They'll send you to
Tavern on the Green...

238
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,582
where they send all the stars.

239
00:23:11,832 --> 00:23:14,835
I'll have eggs and grapefruit
at Tavern on the Green.

240
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:16,295
I hope they have some.

241
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:17,671
Hurry up.

242
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,882
Here we are.

243
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,217
Listen.

244
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,300
There it is.

245
00:24:40,054 --> 00:24:41,139
There it is, baby.

246
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:43,474
Shit.

247
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:45,602
Shall we try?

248
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,271
Wait, Ty.

249
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:53,027
This is our chance
to make it big.

250
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:57,281
We play it right,
we can get a pound of pure...

251
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:02,495
but if we get wasted,
we'll fuck it up.

252
00:25:03,872 --> 00:25:07,042
I ain't trying to jive you, jim.

253
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:11,547
I don't want to run the
streets my whole life with...

254
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:13,257
my nose runnin' down to my chin.

255
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:17,553
But we should take a taste
so we know how much to cut.

256
00:25:18,764 --> 00:25:19,723
It's business.

257
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:24,603
Fair enough.

258
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:33,154
Sheet...

259
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,384
Thank you.

260
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,386
30 days is all it takes.

261
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,556
Number two:
No refined sugar!

262
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,101
Now sugar's everywhere.

263
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,812
Even in bottled water.

264
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:06,023
I was sick with sugar.

265
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,736
It nurtured my spiraling brain
that I felt I was a loser.

266
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,572
Juice by you.

267
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:13,073
Juice by you.

268
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:17,619
Rule 2 is no refined sugar.

269
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,164
Don't even think about
sodas anymore.

270
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:21,624
Sucking candies, very good, sir.

271
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,668
Just stay away from that stuff.

272
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:27,130
No refined sugar.

273
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,592
For 30 days I'll eat right.

274
00:26:30,342 --> 00:26:31,218
I'll pick up my spirits.

275
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:34,138
I am going to try.

276
00:26:36,932 --> 00:26:39,477
I found hope. And in that
hope, I found a way.

277
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:49,739
Stop!

278
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:24,944
Hello?

279
00:27:25,152 --> 00:27:26,278
Rosie?

280
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:27,656
Yeah?

281
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:28,657
Sara.

282
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:29,866
Yeah?

283
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:30,533
I need the number of that doctor.

284
00:27:33,203 --> 00:27:35,372
I don't understand why
you got to see him.

285
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,417
Cut the son of a bitch loose
for Christ's sake.

286
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:42,463
I don't want him telling my
parents I've stopped therapy.

287
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:46,092
They're already pissed
off at me.

288
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:49,805
I'm not going to sleep with him.

289
00:27:50,097 --> 00:27:52,432
I'm coming home after the concert.

290
00:27:54,393 --> 00:27:58,189
You're jealous!
Harry, jealous?

291
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:06,364
You're stubborn, put
your arms around me.

292
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:10,327
Stop that!

293
00:28:11,996 --> 00:28:14,456
I'll suck your eyeballs out.

294
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,542
I'm disappointed...

295
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:21,172
that you're indisposed.

296
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:25,218
Is Anita out of town?

297
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:27,805
Why do you ask?

298
00:28:28,347 --> 00:28:31,601
I was wondering if
she's "indisposed".

299
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:39,902
No, she's fine, thank you.

300
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:41,987
She's in Florida.

301
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:44,823
Can I ask you something personal?

302
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,199
Of course.

303
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:50,997
Anything.

304
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:53,917
You have something over here.

305
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,877
There?

306
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:57,421
A little bit lower.

307
00:28:57,713 --> 00:28:59,882
Don't worry. It's much better.

308
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,342
Arnold.

309
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,430
How are you, Mrs. Goldfarb?

310
00:29:07,097 --> 00:29:10,477
How am I? Enormous.
That's why I'm here.

311
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:12,479
I've seen much worse.

312
00:29:12,896 --> 00:29:13,980
Thank you.

313
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:16,149
How's your hearing and vision?

314
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:18,194
I have both.

315
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,656
The doctor will be
with you shortly.

316
00:29:29,706 --> 00:29:31,333
You're a little overweight.

317
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:32,376
A little?

318
00:29:32,793 --> 00:29:34,920
I have 50 lbs. I'm
willing to donate.

319
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:37,924
We can take care of
that, no problem.

320
00:30:29,397 --> 00:30:32,483
We're on the way, baby.

321
00:30:32,984 --> 00:30:36,112
It was great out there.
Everybody's thirsty.

322
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:38,282
Come to me.

323
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:29,046
Purple in the morning.

324
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:33,425
Blue in the afternoon.
Orange in the evening.

325
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,722
That's my three meals.

326
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:41,476
And green at night.

327
00:31:42,227 --> 00:31:43,270
Just like that. 1, 2, 3, 4.

328
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,976
Come back to bed, honey.

329
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,063
Come on, got plenty
of time for that.

330
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:04,150
I'm grooving with these
new mirrors I got.

331
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:28,177
I told you, ma,
one day I'd make it.

332
00:33:29,095 --> 00:33:31,138
You don't have to make anything.

333
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:32,932
You just have to love your momma.

334
00:33:37,437 --> 00:33:39,022
What are you doing, baby?

335
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,066
Nothing.

336
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:45,779
I was thinking about you...

337
00:33:48,574 --> 00:33:50,868
and about the nasty things
I'm about to do to ya.

338
00:33:52,036 --> 00:33:53,329
I'm going to get on you.

339
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,377
You'll scare me to death.

340
00:33:58,544 --> 00:34:02,631
I won't scare you. I don't
want to scare nobody.

341
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:08,680
All I want is a little
peace and happiness.

342
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:16,397
You're the finest fox I
ever laid my eyes on.

343
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:21,277
That's what I'll do.

344
00:34:22,862 --> 00:34:24,238
For my mother.

345
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,325
I've been thinking about
getting something for her.

346
00:34:26,575 --> 00:34:29,161
Like a present, or something.

347
00:34:29,578 --> 00:34:32,956
But I didn't know what
I was going to get.

348
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:33,957
And?

349
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:37,253
I finally asked myself,
what's her fix?

350
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,465
Television, right?

351
00:34:40,798 --> 00:34:43,092
If ever there's a TV
junkie, it's the old lady.

352
00:34:43,509 --> 00:34:46,722
I owe her a new set anyway
after...

353
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:49,934
being schlepped around
to old Abe's.

354
00:34:50,643 --> 00:34:51,810
You really love her.

355
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:57,233
I guess so.

356
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:03,198
I just want her to be happy.

357
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:04,616
Let's go get it.

358
00:35:08,037 --> 00:35:09,538
Let's push-off first.

359
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:16,129
We shouldn't get going
till tonight.

360
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,626
Number three...

361
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:29,918
Three!

362
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,631
This drives most people crazy.

363
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:40,847
This... is... easy... so... far...

364
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:43,516
Give yourself 30 days...

365
00:36:43,808 --> 00:36:49,106
I guarantee... it will...
change... your... life...

366
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:37,535
I mean that is thin.

367
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:39,537
She doesn't look
like the same person.

368
00:37:40,162 --> 00:37:42,373
I can almost zip the dress.

369
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,292
I've almost got the zipper up.

370
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:45,669
Sara, the mailman.

371
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:48,422
When I see it,
I'll wave it all over.

372
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:51,300
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

373
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:52,801
What did he say?

374
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,971
Don't worry, it'll come.

375
00:37:55,221 --> 00:37:56,389
He said it'll come.

376
00:37:56,848 --> 00:37:58,182
I once waited 2 months
for a package.

377
00:37:58,433 --> 00:37:59,350
Two months?

378
00:38:00,685 --> 00:38:01,853
It's Harry!

379
00:38:02,103 --> 00:38:02,895
Look who's here.

380
00:38:03,104 --> 00:38:04,063
Harry!

381
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:07,359
Easy, you'll crush me,
for Christ's sake.

382
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:09,987
Come inside.

383
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,488
Hi, Harry.

384
00:38:14,868 --> 00:38:17,537
How are you, Harry?
You look so good.

385
00:38:17,787 --> 00:38:18,747
You want something to eat?

386
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,081
No, ma.

387
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:22,584
A little nosh or a piece of cake?

388
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,754
I could go out and get some.

389
00:38:25,004 --> 00:38:29,091
I don't have anything in the
house, but Ada will have.

390
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:30,968
You want something to eat?

391
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,345
No, ma, nothing.

392
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:35,307
Sit down. You make me dizzy,
for Christ's sake.

393
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:37,934
Notice anything about me?

394
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:39,936
Notice I'm slimmer?

395
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:42,022
Yeah, I guess you are, mom.

396
00:38:42,314 --> 00:38:45,652
25 lbs. I lost.
Can you believe it?

397
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:46,986
And that's only the beginning.

398
00:38:47,236 --> 00:38:51,532
I'm really happy for you.
But will you sit?

399
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:59,458
Sorry I haven't been
around in a while.

400
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,210
I've been real busy.

401
00:39:01,543 --> 00:39:04,088
You got a good job?
You're doing well?

402
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:05,840
Yeah, real good.

403
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:07,425
What kind of business?

404
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:10,804
I'm sort of a distributor.

405
00:39:11,054 --> 00:39:12,180
For a big importer.

406
00:39:12,472 --> 00:39:15,434
I'm so happy for you.

407
00:39:15,726 --> 00:39:17,019
Mom, you're killing me.

408
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:19,522
Have you been lifting weights?

409
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,357
I knew you could do it.

410
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:22,650
You were right.

411
00:39:22,942 --> 00:39:25,696
Maybe you'll meet a nice
girl and have a baby.

412
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,866
I already met one.

413
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,036
Don't go ape shit, alright?

414
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,498
Who is she?
Who's her parents?

415
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:36,916
You know her.

416
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,876
Marion Silver. Remember?

417
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,964
Oh, Silver, of course.
Manhattan Beach.

418
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,093
He's got a house on the
esplanade. Garment business.

419
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,470
He's real big in women's undies.

420
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,890
And before you go bouncin'
all over again...

421
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:58,189
I want to tell you
I got you a present.

422
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,318
I don't want a present,
just have a baby.

423
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:05,281
Will you let me tell
you what I got ya?

424
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:09,452
You're something else today.

425
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:12,580
Look, I know...

426
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:16,168
well...

427
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:20,547
I'm sorry for being such a bastard.

428
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:22,591
I want to make it up.

429
00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:25,803
I know I can't change
anything that's happened.

430
00:40:26,054 --> 00:40:30,266
But I want you to know I
love you and I'm sorry.

431
00:40:34,355 --> 00:40:35,814
And I want you to be happy.

432
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:38,984
So I got you a brand new TV set.

433
00:40:39,234 --> 00:40:40,778
It'll be delivered in a few days.

434
00:40:41,028 --> 00:40:42,529
It's from Macy's.

435
00:40:47,202 --> 00:40:51,539
Your father would be so happy
to see what you're doing for me.

436
00:40:56,379 --> 00:40:57,755
You see that, Seymour?

437
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,466
See how good your son is?

438
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,388
He knows what it's like for
his mother living all alone.

439
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,140
No one to visit her...

440
00:41:18,987 --> 00:41:19,737
Hey, ma.

441
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:22,490
You on uppers?

442
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:23,366
What?

443
00:41:23,574 --> 00:41:25,160
You on uppers?

444
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:27,329
You on diet pills?

445
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:29,748
I'm going to a specialist.

446
00:41:30,082 --> 00:41:33,293
You're makin' a croaker for speed.

447
00:41:33,712 --> 00:41:35,630
I'm just going to a doctor.

448
00:41:36,006 --> 00:41:37,590
Does he give ya pills?

449
00:41:37,757 --> 00:41:39,217
Of course. He's a doctor.

450
00:41:39,426 --> 00:41:40,427
What kind of pills?

451
00:41:40,844 --> 00:41:43,305
A purple, blue, orange one...

452
00:41:43,596 --> 00:41:44,598
What's in them?

453
00:41:44,932 --> 00:41:48,185
I'm Sara Goldfarb,
not Albert Einstein.

454
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:49,603
How should I know?

455
00:41:49,812 --> 00:41:50,980
The make you feel good...

456
00:41:51,314 --> 00:41:52,606
and give you pep?

457
00:41:52,898 --> 00:41:55,360
Well, a little.

458
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,322
A little? I can hear you
grinding your teeth from here.

459
00:41:58,572 --> 00:41:59,781
That goes away at night.

460
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,741
At night?

461
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:02,075
With the green one.

462
00:42:02,284 --> 00:42:04,871
In 30 minutes I'm asleep.

463
00:42:05,371 --> 00:42:08,499
You gotta cut that stuff loose.

464
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:10,251
It's no good.

465
00:42:10,543 --> 00:42:13,129
What? 25 lbs. I've lost.

466
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:15,883
Do you want to be a dope fiend?

467
00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:19,386
Am I foaming at the mouth,
or something?

468
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,596
He's a nice doctor.

469
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,890
That croaker's no good.

470
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:24,601
How come you know so much?

471
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:27,020
How come you know more
than a doctor?

472
00:42:29,105 --> 00:42:31,066
Believe me, ma, I know.

473
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:35,863
You'll get strung out.

474
00:42:36,364 --> 00:42:39,116
Come on, I almost
fit in my red dress.

475
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:42,161
The one I wore to your
high school graduation...

476
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,623
your father liked so much.

477
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:48,418
I remember how he looked
at me in the red dress.

478
00:42:51,254 --> 00:42:52,589
What's the big deal?

479
00:42:56,386 --> 00:42:57,887
I'm going to wear...

480
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,932
You don't know?

481
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:06,230
I'm going to be on TV.
I got a call and application...

482
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:09,191
Whose pullin' ya leg?

483
00:43:09,483 --> 00:43:13,947
I'm going to be a
TV contestant.

484
00:43:14,364 --> 00:43:16,491
I don't know when yet.

485
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,077
You'll be so proud
when you see your mother...

486
00:43:19,327 --> 00:43:22,455
in her red dress
and golden shoes...

487
00:43:22,664 --> 00:43:24,250
What's the big deal?

488
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:27,586
Those pills will kill
you before you get on.

489
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:31,173
You drove up in a cab.

490
00:43:32,049 --> 00:43:33,969
Did you see who had the best seat?

491
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:39,016
I'm somebody now.
Everybody likes me.

492
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,481
Millions of people will
see me and like me.

493
00:43:46,733 --> 00:43:49,944
I'll tell them about
you and your father.

494
00:43:50,903 --> 00:43:54,450
How good he was to us.
Remember?

495
00:43:58,037 --> 00:43:59,997
It's a reason to
get up in the morning.

496
00:44:01,874 --> 00:44:05,879
A reason to lose weight,
to fit in the red dress.

497
00:44:07,964 --> 00:44:10,300
A reason to smile.

498
00:44:11,843 --> 00:44:14,430
It makes tomorrow alright.

499
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:19,894
What have I got, Harry?

500
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:26,401
Why should I make the
bed or wash the dishes?

501
00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:30,072
I do but, why should I?

502
00:44:31,573 --> 00:44:32,616
I'm alone.

503
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:37,622
Your father's gone.
You're gone.

504
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:43,837
I got no one to care for.

505
00:44:45,506 --> 00:44:47,341
What have I got, Harry?

506
00:44:52,721 --> 00:44:54,015
I'm lonely.

507
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:58,144
I'm old.

508
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:00,814
You got friends, ma.

509
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:05,486
It's not the same.
They don't need me.

510
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:13,787
I like the way I feel.

511
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:18,667
I like thinking about
the red dress...

512
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:22,337
and television... and
you and your father.

513
00:45:24,382 --> 00:45:27,760
When I get the sun, I smile.

514
00:45:34,143 --> 00:45:35,769
I'll come visit, ma.

515
00:45:37,438 --> 00:45:40,983
Now I'm straight, my business
is going good, I'll come.

516
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:44,112
Me and Marion.
We'll come for dinner.

517
00:45:44,446 --> 00:45:48,450
You bring her. I'll make
you mushroom soup and a roast.

518
00:45:49,868 --> 00:45:53,164
That sounds great, ma.

519
00:45:53,956 --> 00:45:56,500
I'll call ahead of time.

520
00:45:56,751 --> 00:45:59,503
Okay. I'm glad.

521
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,594
I'm glad you have a nice
girl and your own business.

522
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:17,106
I got to go. I have
an appointment in a bit.

523
00:46:17,982 --> 00:46:19,233
But I'll be back.

524
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:21,319
You still got your key?

525
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:22,821
Yeah, I got it, ma.

526
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,659
Goodbye, son.

527
00:47:05,535 --> 00:47:07,161
Brody say you coming up quick.

528
00:47:09,247 --> 00:47:10,498
Thanks, man.

529
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,420
He says you're smart.

530
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:17,006
You're loyal, and not a junkie.

531
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:22,804
Brody wants to promote you.

532
00:47:23,596 --> 00:47:25,765
To give you more responsibility.
You interested?

533
00:47:26,558 --> 00:47:29,602
Yeah, yeah.

534
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,986
Brody says you fuck him,
I'll kill you.

535
00:47:37,194 --> 00:47:37,820
I got that.

536
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:39,280
Remember that.

537
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,953
Shit, you got a white driver.

538
00:48:43,476 --> 00:48:44,852
I love you, Harry.

539
00:48:48,773 --> 00:48:50,566
You make me feel like a person.

540
00:48:53,487 --> 00:48:59,243
Like I'm me and beautiful.

541
00:49:01,203 --> 00:49:03,665
You are beautiful.

542
00:49:07,627 --> 00:49:11,006
The most beautiful
girl in the world.

543
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:14,844
You're my dream.

544
00:49:21,434 --> 00:49:24,771
<i>No, Mrs. Goldfarb, I'm sure.</i>
<i>I've checked again.</i>

545
00:49:25,022 --> 00:49:27,858
Maybe you got me a weaker
one last time.

546
00:49:28,316 --> 00:49:29,776
<i>That isn't possible.</i>

547
00:49:29,985 --> 00:49:32,071
<i>They're all the same potency.</i>

548
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,157
Something isn't the same.

549
00:49:34,365 --> 00:49:36,034
<i>You're becoming adjusted to them.</i>

550
00:49:36,242 --> 00:49:39,078
<i>It's nothing to worry</i>
<i>about, Mrs. Goldfarb.</i>

551
00:49:57,474 --> 00:49:58,808
We got a winner!

552
00:49:59,017 --> 00:49:59,809
We got a winner!

553
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,269
We got a winner!

554
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:04,857
A beautiful woman
with a magical smile.

555
00:50:05,232 --> 00:50:07,109
Straight from Brighton
Beach Brooklyn.

556
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:10,404
Let's give a juicy welcome
to Mrs. Sara Goldfarb.

557
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:12,532
Juice by Sara!

558
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:15,827
Juice by Sara!
Juice by Sara!

559
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:19,206
Juice by Sara!

560
00:50:30,968 --> 00:50:33,889
Tyrone C. Get your shit
together. You made bail.

561
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,683
How much?

562
00:50:36,308 --> 00:50:39,311
Most of our cash.
You're up for consortin'.

563
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,314
Shit, man.

564
00:50:41,731 --> 00:50:44,317
It's a war between
Italians and blacks.

565
00:50:44,901 --> 00:50:47,320
Sal is keeping the
shit down in Florida...

566
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:49,531
until guys like Brody
are all knocked off.

567
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:50,573
Sheeit.

568
00:50:51,242 --> 00:50:52,034
No one's got a thing.

569
00:50:52,451 --> 00:50:53,452
Except Big Tim.

570
00:50:53,744 --> 00:50:55,496
Shit, let's go see him.

571
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,457
He ain't selling.
He only giving up fuzzies.

572
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,042
What?

573
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:02,754
He's hooked on the thing, man.

574
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:04,965
I told him I'd give
him all he wants...

575
00:51:05,173 --> 00:51:06,425
but he ain't selling.

576
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:19,522
<i>Number three!</i>

577
00:51:19,897 --> 00:51:21,191
<i>Number three!</i>

578
00:51:21,734 --> 00:51:25,070
<i>This drives most people crazy.</i>

579
00:51:25,738 --> 00:51:26,989
<i>You're not going to like it!</i>

580
00:51:27,364 --> 00:51:28,532
<i>This is easy so far.</i>

581
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:31,161
<i>Give this up for 30 days...</i>

582
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:46,343
You alright?

583
00:51:49,263 --> 00:51:51,266
Yeah. It was a bad dream.

584
00:51:53,185 --> 00:51:54,436
Want some water?

585
00:52:17,336 --> 00:52:18,379
Maybe we should dip now.

586
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,882
Marion, I already told you.

587
00:52:23,385 --> 00:52:24,803
It's all we have.

588
00:52:25,136 --> 00:52:27,806
Tyrone is going to
score in the morning?

589
00:52:34,105 --> 00:52:37,358
I don't know.
It's a bitch out there.

590
00:52:39,652 --> 00:52:41,238
It'll be okay.

591
00:52:43,865 --> 00:52:45,450
It'll be okay, Harry.

592
00:52:50,832 --> 00:52:53,334
Yeah, I guess so.

593
00:53:01,176 --> 00:53:02,803
I love you, Harry.

594
00:53:42,221 --> 00:53:44,557
What's the problem?
The weight's fine.

595
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:47,769
The weight's fine. I'm not.

596
00:53:48,978 --> 00:53:50,898
The refrigerator...

597
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:53,358
Something wrong?

598
00:53:56,945 --> 00:53:58,447
Everything's...

599
00:54:02,786 --> 00:54:04,996
all mixed up...

600
00:54:05,538 --> 00:54:06,706
confused like.

601
00:54:06,915 --> 00:54:08,917
Don't worry, just get this filled.

602
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,503
Make an appointment for a week.

603
00:54:20,931 --> 00:54:21,890
Well?

604
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:24,518
Tyrone ain't found nothing yet.

605
00:54:27,437 --> 00:54:28,772
What are we going to do?

606
00:54:29,523 --> 00:54:30,817
I don't know.

607
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:33,653
You have to do something here.

608
00:54:33,861 --> 00:54:35,905
It's your fault we don't
have something.

609
00:54:36,114 --> 00:54:37,281
What are you talking about?

610
00:54:38,032 --> 00:54:40,077
You were hot to
get off last night.

611
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:41,578
That is bullshit!

612
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:43,997
We could have had something.

613
00:54:44,206 --> 00:54:45,999
I'm going to sit around and...

614
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:47,960
watch you push-off alone?

615
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:50,004
Don't put it all on me.

616
00:55:01,475 --> 00:55:04,812
Don't worry, man.
We'll fill it up again.

617
00:55:05,771 --> 00:55:07,314
Things will get better.

618
00:55:08,357 --> 00:55:11,278
We'll fill the box back up.

619
00:55:19,077 --> 00:55:20,580
You want to hear the news?

620
00:55:21,497 --> 00:55:22,915
What news?

621
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:25,752
You got good news and bad news.

622
00:55:27,962 --> 00:55:28,963
Shoot.

623
00:55:29,172 --> 00:55:33,218
Good news is, in a couple of
days, they'll be prime back.

624
00:55:34,678 --> 00:55:35,429
Really?

625
00:55:38,265 --> 00:55:39,058
Who told you?

626
00:55:40,226 --> 00:55:41,227
Angel.

627
00:55:41,436 --> 00:55:42,520
Yeah?

628
00:55:42,896 --> 00:55:44,814
Says Sal sent word...

629
00:55:45,023 --> 00:55:47,484
to let go a couple of
keys for Christmas.

630
00:55:47,692 --> 00:55:49,069
Not wanting anybody...

631
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:51,989
wantin' this glorious season.

632
00:55:52,406 --> 00:55:53,532
You believe it?

633
00:55:53,866 --> 00:55:56,744
I did, until I heard
the bad news.

634
00:56:03,418 --> 00:56:04,252
Yeah?

635
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:07,381
Price is doubled and you
have to cop for weight.

636
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,717
At least half a piece.

637
00:56:10,009 --> 00:56:10,802
How much?

638
00:56:12,095 --> 00:56:13,137
Two.

639
00:56:14,263 --> 00:56:15,681
Two? That's fucking insane!

640
00:56:16,099 --> 00:56:17,350
What the fuck you gonna do?

641
00:56:17,558 --> 00:56:19,812
He won't lay no nickel
bag on you.

642
00:56:20,104 --> 00:56:21,730
Where we gonna get two?

643
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:23,899
You mean Arnold?

644
00:56:25,275 --> 00:56:27,820
Your parents won't even
return your call.

645
00:56:29,781 --> 00:56:31,241
I haven't seen him in months.

646
00:56:31,741 --> 00:56:33,201
So what? He's still calling.

647
00:56:34,202 --> 00:56:35,328
I don't know.

648
00:56:37,122 --> 00:56:38,706
I don't know what else to do.

649
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:42,461
This is our last chance
to get back on track.

650
00:56:42,711 --> 00:56:45,631
We won't have to scuffle
and make that freezing scene.

651
00:56:48,718 --> 00:56:50,637
We need the bread.

652
00:56:50,846 --> 00:56:53,515
Getting the money
is not the problem.

653
00:56:54,224 --> 00:56:56,184
Then what is the problem?

654
00:56:56,852 --> 00:56:59,020
Don't know what I'll
have to do to get it.

655
00:57:06,696 --> 00:57:07,697
Look...

656
00:57:08,364 --> 00:57:09,366
baby...

657
00:57:11,076 --> 00:57:13,579
we'll be back in business
in no time.

658
00:57:15,038 --> 00:57:18,834
We'll start moving again
and saving.

659
00:57:21,129 --> 00:57:25,133
It'll be perfect. Just
like it was. I promise.

660
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,348
You'll see.

661
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,862
I had the flu forever,
it seems like.

662
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,533
Are you depressed?

663
00:57:48,909 --> 00:57:50,036
No, nothing like that.

664
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:52,830
I've been really busy.

665
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:56,918
I've been designing non stop.

666
00:57:57,126 --> 00:58:00,047
I'm glad to hear you've
been productive.

667
00:58:05,177 --> 00:58:09,182
To be frank, I was surprised
to hear from you.

668
00:58:13,937 --> 00:58:15,146
Something wrong?

669
00:58:15,522 --> 00:58:17,107
No, why?

670
00:58:17,732 --> 00:58:21,195
That's usually the case
when you get a call...

671
00:58:21,445 --> 00:58:22,905
from someone you haven't
heard from for a while.

672
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:24,907
Everything's fine.

673
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:30,789
Actually...

674
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:37,045
I have a favor to ask.

675
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:45,805
You smug fuck!

676
00:58:46,848 --> 00:58:47,765
What is it?

677
00:58:53,981 --> 00:58:55,149
I need to borrow some money.

678
00:58:55,482 --> 00:58:57,109
May I ask for what?

679
00:58:59,821 --> 00:59:00,947
Turn the light off.

680
00:59:01,364 --> 00:59:02,866
What for?

681
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:05,452
Just do it.

682
00:59:06,411 --> 00:59:07,287
You never did before.

683
00:59:07,495 --> 00:59:09,081
Please, Arnold.

684
01:02:38,562 --> 01:02:39,855
Where is everybody?

685
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:41,481
I don't know, man.

686
01:02:42,357 --> 01:02:44,484
They said meet at Waldbaum's.

687
01:02:47,989 --> 01:02:49,323
Sure this is the right one?

688
01:02:49,574 --> 01:02:51,159
Yeah, man, I'm positive.

689
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:56,038
You watch my back,
and I'll watch yours.

690
01:03:00,502 --> 01:03:01,587
What the fuck now?

691
01:03:15,393 --> 01:03:16,895
Everyone and their mother.

692
01:03:19,148 --> 01:03:21,275
The truck's going to be here.
Back up.

693
01:03:24,695 --> 01:03:25,738
Back up!

694
01:03:34,414 --> 01:03:36,082
Here we go, guys.

695
01:04:53,918 --> 01:04:55,962
Stupid fucking junkie.
We're fucked!

696
01:04:56,171 --> 01:04:59,258
We're fucked.
That's the last shit for miles.

697
01:04:59,508 --> 01:05:00,342
Muthafuckas going back
to Florida...

698
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,970
while we're ass deep
in motherfucking snow.

699
01:05:07,726 --> 01:05:09,436
What if we went to cop?

700
01:05:09,978 --> 01:05:10,896
You serious?

701
01:05:11,104 --> 01:05:12,230
Why not?

702
01:05:12,439 --> 01:05:14,232
What the fuck are you saying?

703
01:05:14,441 --> 01:05:16,067
We go to a fuckin' room clerk...

704
01:05:16,276 --> 01:05:18,571
and ask him for a connection?

705
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,032
You can't nose out some
dope when it's around?

706
01:05:23,576 --> 01:05:25,661
We got nothin' to lose.

707
01:05:25,953 --> 01:05:27,998
If we get there now...

708
01:05:28,332 --> 01:05:29,500
we name our price...

709
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:30,959
and be cool.

710
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:33,045
Have them scufflin' for us.

711
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:39,260
Last summer was a mother
fucking ball.

712
01:05:44,682 --> 01:05:47,269
Seems like a thousand years ago.

713
01:05:48,687 --> 01:05:50,106
It'll be back like that.

714
01:05:54,819 --> 01:05:59,282
Angel'll get us a short if we
get him some dynamite scag.

715
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:19,954
Where have you been?

716
01:07:20,622 --> 01:07:22,040
Where the hell do you think?

717
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:24,709
Where's the score?

718
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:26,587
We had a bit of a problem.

719
01:07:26,879 --> 01:07:30,466
Everything was going good,
and then...

720
01:07:30,883 --> 01:07:32,176
some dumb ass junkie...

721
01:07:32,384 --> 01:07:33,135
Did what?

722
01:07:33,385 --> 01:07:35,095
Some dumb ass junkie did what?

723
01:07:35,387 --> 01:07:36,556
You fucked it up?

724
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:38,391
What the fuck is wrong with you?

725
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:40,393
You promised everything
was going to be okay.

726
01:07:40,602 --> 01:07:42,896
I fucked that sleazebag for you.

727
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:44,856
I put myself through fucking hell!

728
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:46,108
There's nothing out there.

729
01:07:46,359 --> 01:07:47,485
I don't give a shit!

730
01:07:47,777 --> 01:07:49,779
You fucking loser!

731
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:54,867
You want extra stuff?

732
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:57,496
A guy's holding some extra weight.

733
01:07:58,330 --> 01:07:59,581
But he ain't selling!

734
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:02,668
<i>Yeah?</i>

735
01:08:02,876 --> 01:08:03,919
Give me that guy's number.

736
01:08:04,086 --> 01:08:05,170
<i>What guy?</i>

737
01:08:05,379 --> 01:08:06,297
The guy who likes broads.

738
01:08:06,506 --> 01:08:07,549
<i>Big Tim?</i>

739
01:08:07,757 --> 01:08:09,509
Give me the fucking number.

740
01:08:09,843 --> 01:08:10,969
<i>Alright. 9, 3, 4...</i>

741
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:13,138
<i>8, 7, 7, 7.</i>

742
01:08:15,849 --> 01:08:18,686
Here, go fix yourself
up with him.

743
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,896
You won't have to wait so much...

744
01:08:21,105 --> 01:08:23,399
and I won't freeze my ass off
in the fucking streets.

745
01:09:00,273 --> 01:09:01,774
<i>We got a winner.</i>

746
01:09:02,025 --> 01:09:03,359
<i>We got a winner.</i>

747
01:09:03,568 --> 01:09:04,402
<i>We got a winner.</i>

748
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:06,322
<i>We got a winner.</i>

749
01:09:07,781 --> 01:09:10,576
<i>A beautiful woman with</i>
<i>a winning sense of humor...</i>

750
01:09:11,076 --> 01:09:13,162
<i>and a magical smile.</i>

751
01:09:13,496 --> 01:09:15,414
From Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

752
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:20,420
Give a juicy welcome to our
very own Mrs. Sara Goldfarb.

753
01:09:21,129 --> 01:09:23,590
<i>Juice by Sara!</i>
<i>Juice by Sara!</i>

754
01:09:24,049 --> 01:09:26,093
<i>Juice by Sara!</i>

755
01:09:26,302 --> 01:09:29,430
<i>Juice by Sara!</i>

756
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:33,059
It's a pleasure to be here.

757
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:34,560
It's a pleasure to have you.

758
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:36,939
That is one smashing dress.

759
01:09:41,193 --> 01:09:43,529
Thank you, Tappy.
I'd like to say hello...

760
01:09:43,821 --> 01:09:45,447
to my husband Seymour...

761
01:09:45,656 --> 01:09:48,576
<i>and to my beautiful,</i>
<i>successful son Harold.</i>

762
01:09:50,495 --> 01:09:52,872
Harold, I hope you're in love.

763
01:09:54,707 --> 01:09:56,877
Come see me and bring Marion.

764
01:09:57,753 --> 01:09:59,171
He'll be here soon.

765
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,508
Are you ready?

766
01:10:03,634 --> 01:10:05,177
I'm ready, Tappy.

767
01:10:07,305 --> 01:10:09,224
Not to worry.

768
01:10:12,477 --> 01:10:14,104
What are you doing here?

769
01:10:15,731 --> 01:10:16,899
Why are you here?

770
01:10:18,109 --> 01:10:18,734
This place...

771
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,986
What do you want?

772
01:10:20,736 --> 01:10:21,863
Tappy!

773
01:10:22,155 --> 01:10:23,447
Join us in creating excellence.

774
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:26,994
I thought you'd never ask.

775
01:10:34,543 --> 01:10:36,254
That's disgusting.

776
01:10:36,421 --> 01:10:37,630
What do you expect?

777
01:10:39,466 --> 01:10:40,717
Could you do better?

778
01:10:43,136 --> 01:10:46,432
It's an old building.
It hasn't been painted in years.

779
01:10:47,349 --> 01:10:49,727
I'm old. Alone.

780
01:10:50,519 --> 01:10:51,770
You don't understand.

781
01:10:52,354 --> 01:10:54,231
Please, I'll explain.

782
01:11:35,653 --> 01:11:37,404
I don't want this.

783
01:11:38,823 --> 01:11:39,990
Get away from me!

784
01:11:41,283 --> 01:11:42,326
Ready, Mrs. Goldfarb?

785
01:11:42,535 --> 01:11:43,494
For what?

786
01:11:43,702 --> 01:11:44,912
3... 2...

787
01:12:37,596 --> 01:12:38,680
Feed me, Sara.

788
01:12:40,682 --> 01:12:41,850
Feed me, Sara.

789
01:12:42,267 --> 01:12:43,977
Feed me, Sara.

790
01:12:44,311 --> 01:12:46,022
Feed me, Sara.

791
01:12:46,397 --> 01:12:50,109
Feed me, Sara.
Feed me, Sara.

792
01:12:50,359 --> 01:12:52,653
Feed me, Sara.

793
01:12:54,113 --> 01:12:57,159
Feed me, Sara.
Feed me, Sara.

794
01:12:57,826 --> 01:13:00,704
Feed me, Sara.
Feed me, Sara.

795
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:40,414
Thank you, Angel.

796
01:13:42,834 --> 01:13:46,880
Hope this mutha' fucker works.
Could use some heat.

797
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,299
How long will it take?

798
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:50,884
We'll make it in a day.

799
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:52,594
A day.

800
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,932
Shit. California, here we come.

801
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:57,642
It's Florida.

802
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:02,397
Either way, your pale ass
getting a tan, right?

803
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:09,196
This train go to Madison Avenue?

804
01:14:10,406 --> 01:14:11,866
You know Maylin and Block?

805
01:14:12,283 --> 01:14:14,870
I have their address.
They're on Madison Ave.

806
01:14:15,579 --> 01:14:17,122
I'm going to be on TV.

807
01:14:17,455 --> 01:14:18,874
You're whacked!

808
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:23,211
Hello?

809
01:14:23,795 --> 01:14:25,923
This train go to Madison Avenue?

810
01:14:28,176 --> 01:14:30,469
I'm going to be on TV.

811
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,766
I just have to find out when.

812
01:14:36,393 --> 01:14:37,352
Florida?

813
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:42,691
When's he back?

814
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:46,029
A few days!?

815
01:14:46,446 --> 01:14:51,034
What am I supposed to do?
You gotta help me!

816
01:14:53,036 --> 01:14:54,705
I can get you money.

817
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:59,210
Angel, there's got
to be something.

818
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:00,044
Help me!

819
01:15:00,252 --> 01:15:02,087
<i>Why aren't you calling me?</i>

820
01:15:03,589 --> 01:15:06,134
<i>I have to know</i>
<i>when I'll be on TV.</i>

821
01:15:08,053 --> 01:15:11,598
I'm Sara Goldfarb and...

822
01:15:12,057 --> 01:15:14,936
you should tell me when
I'll be on TV.

823
01:15:15,394 --> 01:15:17,230
Sit, I'll ring them.

824
01:15:17,438 --> 01:15:19,440
I just want to know when.

825
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:21,609
Maybe you lost my card.

826
01:15:21,901 --> 01:15:24,905
You'll have a look
and you'll tell me.

827
01:15:26,281 --> 01:15:27,866
It's not the prizes.

828
01:15:28,116 --> 01:15:29,076
I'll give them away.

829
01:15:30,285 --> 01:15:32,120
I just want to be on the show.

830
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:34,791
I've waited so long...

831
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:38,920
to be with my Harry
and grandson.

832
01:15:40,129 --> 01:15:42,298
Mrs. Goldfarb, sip this.

833
01:15:42,882 --> 01:15:46,136
Sometimes it takes a
while to get called.

834
01:15:52,726 --> 01:15:53,811
- This her?
- Yes.

835
01:15:54,354 --> 01:15:55,063
Can you walk?

836
01:15:55,397 --> 01:15:57,941
I'm walking across this stage.

837
01:15:58,567 --> 01:16:02,195
You should see my Harry
on television.

838
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:04,699
We're giving the prizes away.

839
01:16:05,324 --> 01:16:08,077
I just wanted to be on the show!

840
01:16:10,955 --> 01:16:12,248
<i>What's her name?</i>

841
01:16:12,456 --> 01:16:13,166
<i>Sara Goldfarb.</i>

842
01:16:14,084 --> 01:16:17,921
Call Seymour to meet me
at the beauty parlor.

843
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:20,841
I got the dress I wore
to Harry's graduation...

844
01:16:21,049 --> 01:16:22,426
and the gold shoes.

845
01:16:22,634 --> 01:16:24,470
Okay, Mrs. Goldfarb.

846
01:16:25,638 --> 01:16:27,557
One... two... three...

847
01:16:28,224 --> 01:16:30,101
Take it nice and easy.

848
01:16:54,337 --> 01:16:55,671
Yeah?

849
01:17:19,072 --> 01:17:20,198
Yeah?

850
01:17:22,242 --> 01:17:23,368
Hi.

851
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:31,210
Rosa, I'm going to be on TV.

852
01:17:59,783 --> 01:18:03,830
Sheet. God damned Jim,
how long you had that?

853
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:06,666
A few days.

854
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:08,668
It don't look too good.

855
01:18:09,085 --> 01:18:10,962
I don't feel too good either.

856
01:18:14,049 --> 01:18:16,010
Some stuff'll take care of that.

857
01:18:16,218 --> 01:18:18,053
Don't shoot in there.

858
01:18:19,013 --> 01:18:20,389
I'll blow it if I don't.

859
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,975
Fuck it!

860
01:18:35,823 --> 01:18:36,782
Oh, shit.

861
01:18:52,508 --> 01:18:54,135
Hi, can you hear me?

862
01:18:54,344 --> 01:18:55,428
Yes, Seymour.

863
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:56,513
Did you take anything?

864
01:18:56,971 --> 01:18:58,890
I took my red dress in.

865
01:18:59,474 --> 01:19:00,892
Take her to psych.

866
01:19:12,947 --> 01:19:14,115
Come on in.

867
01:19:24,502 --> 01:19:25,962
What's your name?

868
01:19:28,548 --> 01:19:29,632
Marion.

869
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:31,759
What do you know, Maid Marion.

870
01:19:40,477 --> 01:19:41,645
I'm Little John.

871
01:19:45,441 --> 01:19:46,818
Beautiful view...

872
01:19:47,026 --> 01:19:48,611
Know what I like about
patty chicks?

873
01:19:50,947 --> 01:19:52,365
They give good head.

874
01:19:53,993 --> 01:19:56,245
Black broads don't
give good head.

875
01:19:56,704 --> 01:19:58,122
I don't know why.

876
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:01,458
Maybe it's because of some
ancient tribal customs.

877
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:25,110
Save some of the energy.

878
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,423
I know it's pretty, baby...

879
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,717
but I didn't take it out for air.

880
01:21:04,195 --> 01:21:06,614
I told you to stay
away from that arm.

881
01:21:09,283 --> 01:21:11,202
I gotta call Marion.

882
01:21:11,577 --> 01:21:13,914
That's a long distance call now.

883
01:21:14,998 --> 01:21:16,542
That's 600 miles.

884
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:19,419
We're 600 miles
closer to Miami.

885
01:21:19,711 --> 01:21:23,341
And 600 miles further
away from New York.

886
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:30,932
I know where you could
pick up a nice taste.

887
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:32,726
It's more like play.

888
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,312
Sunday we're throwing a gathering.

889
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:37,189
All good people.

890
01:21:38,274 --> 01:21:40,192
I can't, I'm busy.

891
01:21:40,401 --> 01:21:42,027
I'm not really hooked.

892
01:21:42,362 --> 01:21:45,365
I'm tellin' ya',
it's a real nice taste.

893
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:53,749
See you Sunday, Maid Marion.

894
01:21:55,751 --> 01:21:58,170
Try and answer my questions.

895
01:21:58,546 --> 01:21:59,922
When did you start the pills?

896
01:22:02,133 --> 01:22:03,135
The summer.

897
01:22:03,468 --> 01:22:04,595
Last summer?

898
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:07,180
I got the best place. In the sun.

899
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,808
Ada fixed my hair.

900
01:22:10,017 --> 01:22:11,435
Everything'll be alright.

901
01:22:11,977 --> 01:22:13,771
We'll get you fixed up in no time.

902
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:36,379
You're okay.

903
01:22:36,796 --> 01:22:40,508
I can't cut it. I gotta do
something about this arm.

904
01:22:40,967 --> 01:22:42,553
Let's see it.

905
01:22:49,977 --> 01:22:52,022
Oh, damn, Jim.

906
01:22:54,024 --> 01:22:55,192
Oh, man.

907
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,027
That's an ugly mothafucka'.

908
01:22:57,861 --> 01:22:59,196
I gotta call Marion.

909
01:22:59,488 --> 01:23:02,825
Fuck that. We got to
get you to a hospital.

910
01:23:07,956 --> 01:23:09,457
What is that?

911
01:23:12,169 --> 01:23:13,295
I don't want that.

912
01:23:52,672 --> 01:23:53,840
What's the problem?

913
01:23:54,048 --> 01:23:56,593
My arm, it's killing me.

914
01:23:56,843 --> 01:23:57,969
Let's have a look.

915
01:24:02,933 --> 01:24:03,601
Alright.

916
01:24:08,022 --> 01:24:09,773
I'll be back in a minute.

917
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:38,513
I want to play blackjack
all night.

918
01:24:39,014 --> 01:24:40,265
<i>So I make up this routine.</i>

919
01:24:40,474 --> 01:24:42,018
<i>I tell them I don't feel good.</i>

920
01:24:42,227 --> 01:24:43,728
<i>Have a good time dancing, guys.</i>

921
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,813
<i>They leave the room.</i>

922
01:24:46,189 --> 01:24:49,567
Ready? One... two... three...

923
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:54,240
<i>As soon as they leave, I</i>
<i>run back down to the casino.</i>

924
01:24:54,448 --> 01:24:57,660
<i>Sit at my blackjack</i>
<i>table the whole night.</i>

925
01:24:57,952 --> 01:25:00,246
<i>Finally I got up big.</i>

926
01:25:00,538 --> 01:25:03,792
<i>I got $500 black chips.</i>

927
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:07,087
<i>Hours are going by,</i>
<i>I'm laying bets.</i>

928
01:25:10,799 --> 01:25:13,678
<i>Next thing, this guy</i>
<i>is sitting next to me.</i>

929
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:15,388
<i>A security guard.</i>

930
01:25:15,638 --> 01:25:17,265
<i>Tells me I have to leave.</i>

931
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,060
<i>I'm like "why leave?"</i>

932
01:25:35,285 --> 01:25:36,828
S-w-a-l-l-o-w!

933
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:08,321
You have to eat.

934
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:10,615
To get healthy, you have to eat.

935
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:12,910
Work with the attendants.

936
01:26:13,285 --> 01:26:15,245
I'll try some new medications.

937
01:27:17,689 --> 01:27:18,690
Hello?

938
01:27:19,023 --> 01:27:19,941
Marion?

939
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:22,653
Harry?

940
01:27:24,029 --> 01:27:27,700
I've been thinking about you.

941
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:30,536
Are you okay?

942
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,125
When are you coming home?

943
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:37,085
Soon.

944
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:38,753
When?

945
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:44,302
<i>Soon. You holding out alright?</i>

946
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,595
Harry...

947
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:50,767
can you come today?

948
01:28:03,781 --> 01:28:05,241
I'll come.

949
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:08,536
<i>I'll come today.</i>

950
01:28:13,876 --> 01:28:15,836
Just wait for me, alright?

951
01:28:19,632 --> 01:28:20,759
Okay, Harry.

952
01:28:21,009 --> 01:28:22,552
I'm coming back.

953
01:28:23,637 --> 01:28:24,346
Yeah.

954
01:28:24,554 --> 01:28:25,555
Marion.

955
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:26,348
Yeah.

956
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:30,060
I'm sorry, Marion.

957
01:28:30,728 --> 01:28:32,104
I know.

958
01:28:41,531 --> 01:28:42,991
Mrs. Goldfarb...

959
01:28:45,452 --> 01:28:46,870
are you alright?

960
01:28:49,456 --> 01:28:51,709
Mrs. Goldfarb...

961
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,337
<i>we've tried several</i>
<i>medications...</i>

962
01:28:54,754 --> 01:28:56,798
and you don't respond.

963
01:28:57,006 --> 01:28:58,967
We might want to try some...

964
01:28:59,175 --> 01:29:01,011
alternative methods.

965
01:29:01,637 --> 01:29:04,598
We've had excellent results
with ECT in the past.

966
01:29:05,975 --> 01:29:09,937
So if I can just get
your John Hancock...

967
01:29:11,398 --> 01:29:13,358
we'll get underway.

968
01:29:16,194 --> 01:29:17,404
Jesus Christ.

969
01:29:19,531 --> 01:29:21,075
I need a doctor.

970
01:29:21,909 --> 01:29:24,704
My friend is sick.
Can you help?

971
01:29:24,912 --> 01:29:28,374
I can't take it. My arm!
My fucking arm!

972
01:29:30,544 --> 01:29:31,878
Help me!

973
01:29:32,212 --> 01:29:34,715
Somebody fucking help us, please!

974
01:29:56,739 --> 01:29:57,907
Maid Marion.

975
01:29:58,282 --> 01:29:59,825
Welcome.

976
01:30:00,035 --> 01:30:01,953
Can you see me?

977
01:30:02,162 --> 01:30:02,871

978
01:30:03,079 --> 01:30:03,622

01:30:35,114 --> 01:30:36,157
Showtime.

995
01:30:38,409 --> 01:30:40,162
Can you see me?

996
01:30:42,289 --> 01:30:45,626
Say "sir". God damn New Yawk
dope fien niggas.

997
01:30:46,085 --> 01:30:46,919
Learn some manners.

998
01:30:48,128 --> 01:30:49,505
Can you see me?

999
01:30:50,799 --> 01:30:51,883
Yes, sir.

1000
01:30:52,217 --> 01:30:53,218
Okay for work.

1001
01:30:54,344 --> 01:30:56,429
Can you hear me?
Can you see me?

1002
01:30:56,805 --> 01:30:58,390
Something wrong with his arm.

1003
01:30:58,890 --> 01:30:59,725
Ma...

1004
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:03,646
You won't be putting
more dope in that arm.

1005
01:31:04,188 --> 01:31:05,648
It smells worse than he do.

1006
01:31:06,065 --> 01:31:07,441
Get him to the hospital.

1007
01:31:07,692 --> 01:31:09,235
He won't live out the week.

1008
01:31:12,072 --> 01:31:12,864
One.

1009
01:31:36,181 --> 01:31:38,434
<i>That's the trouble with</i>
<i>New York dope fiends.</i>

1010
01:31:39,018 --> 01:31:41,104
You got a rotten attitude.

1011
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,732
What we do now?

1012
01:31:44,482 --> 01:31:45,650
Ass to ass.

1013
01:31:58,205 --> 01:32:01,418
Put your spineless back into it.

1014
01:32:04,922 --> 01:32:05,756
And...

1015
01:32:06,214 --> 01:32:07,132

Okay. Ready? And three.

Cum. Cum, cum, cum,

01:32:50,722 --> 01:32:51,598
Off at the shoulder.

1019
01:32:51,848 --> 01:32:53,642
Move or we lose him.

1020
01:32:53,892 --> 01:32:58,021
Cum. Cum, cum, cum,
cum, cum, cum, cum.

1021
01:32:58,397 --> 01:33:01,776
Cum. Cum, cum, cum,

01:33:44,364 --> 01:33:45,741

1024
01:33:47,159 --> 01:33:47,534
Marion?

1025
01:33:49,078 --> 01:33:51,998
It's alright. Don't worry.

1026
01:33:52,874 --> 01:33:53,958
Marion.

1027
01:33:54,208 --> 01:33:55,335
<i>Who's that?</i>

1028
01:33:55,543 --> 01:33:57,086
She'll be sent for.
She'll come.

1029
01:33:59,632 --> 01:34:00,716
No.

1030
01:34:01,383 --> 01:34:02,593
No?

1031
01:34:04,887 --> 01:34:06,430
No, she won't.

1032
01:34:07,264 --> 01:34:08,641
She'll come.

1033
01:34:12,062 --> 01:34:13,563
No, she won't.

1034
01:36:13,153 --> 01:36:14,863
<i>We got a winner.</i>

1046
01:36:48,359 --> 01:36:49,568
