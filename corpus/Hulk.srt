1
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:13,122
There's simply no way to shield
against every weaponized agent.

2
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:15,040
Instead, I can make
super-immune systems...

3
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:17,686
by strengthening
the human cellular response.

4
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,605
Banner, I know
where you're going.

5
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,753
But manipulating the immune system
is dangerous and stupid.

6
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,589
The president's science advisors
made it absolutely clear...

7
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,542
no human subjects.

8
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:51,675
David, I have wonderful news.

9
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:56,624
I'm gonna have a baby.

10
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,172
What's it gonna be? Whoa, look at that,
Bruce. Huh? Want a dinosaur?

11
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:38,627
Let's have a little fight.

12
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:40,968
You don't scare me.

13
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:46,031
That's a delicious eyeball. Ooh, you're big
and green and scary. I'm gonna run away.

14
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:14,035
Really, speaking of Cheryl,
guess what...

15
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:15,992
Bruce, you're hurt!

16
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:20,058
Jack hit him with the stick,
but Bruce wouldn't hit him back.

17
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,552
He just stood there, shaking.

18
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:24,546
It's okay.

19
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:33,139
Yeah, strange
he didn't make a peep.

20
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:35,594
Any other kid
would've wailed his head off.

21
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,205
That's Bruce. He's like that.

22
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:39,738
He's just so... bottled up.

23
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:46,681
The samples we found in your lab...
they were human blood.

24
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,600
You've ignored protocol.

25
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:51,284
You had no right
snooping around in my lab.

26
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,241
That's my business.

27
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:57,116
Wrong, Banner. It's government business,
and you're off the project.

28
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:21,054
Attention, all personnel.
Fail-safe has been initiated.

29
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:23,623
Gamma decontamination
will occur in 30 minutes!

30
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,311
Evacuate immediately!

31
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,574
I repeat, evacuate immediately!

32
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:48,904
- Edith?
- David, what's going on?

33
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,050
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

34
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,962
What are you doing?

35
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:29,568
What are you doing?

36
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:32,445
I'm trying to tell you
what has to be done!

37
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:34,861
David, please stop it!
No!

38
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:41,767
No! No!
Yes!

39
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:44,145
David! No!

40
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:52,738
Bruce.

41
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:54,695
Bruce, wake up, son.

42
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,648
Bruce. Bruce.

43
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:03,250
Another nightmare?

44
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:05,666
I don't know.

45
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:07,738
I don't remember.

46
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,152
Hi, Mom.

47
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:15,295
Already off to college.

48
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,213
Gonna miss you terribly.

49
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,169
I'll miss you too.

50
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,164
Please, come here.

51
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:24,923
Look at you.

52
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:27,954
Soon to be a great scientist.

53
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:29,756
I guess.

54
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,714
- I mean, who knows?
- I do.

55
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:35,780
There's something inside you...
so special.

56
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:38,657
Some kind of greatness.

57
00:10:38,695 --> 00:10:40,767
I'm sure someday you're gonna...

58
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:43,107
share it with the whole world.

59
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,502
But as far as I'm concerned,
security oughta be...

60
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:40,419
Good morning, Dr. Krenzler.

61
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:44,217
Security oughta be beefed up. In a
place like this you can't be too careful

62
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:46,480
Bruce! Big day.

63
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:49,396
- Did you sleep? I didn't sleep.
- I slept okay.

64
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:51,736
- Is Betty here?
- She's around.

65
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:54,844
I really gotta say, seeing you
in that stylin' head wear...

66
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,989
You're implying something
about my helmet?

67
00:11:58,104 --> 00:12:00,943
You look like a massive nerd,
even around other scientists.

68
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:05,124
Can I just ask... Were you wearing
the helmet while she dumped you?

69
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,502
See, it protects my very
important brain, Harper.

70
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,574
Go prep the samples.

71
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:13,870
- Hey. I found you.
- Betty, hey.

72
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:19,126
I hate them.

73
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:21,390
- Wait, I just got here. Who do we hate?
- The review board.

74
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:24,267
We have to make a
presentation on Tuesday.

75
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:26,338
And you're gonna make it with me.

76
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:28,487
You think I should?

77
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:30,868
Yeah, you're great with that stuff.

78
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:35,891
You start talking about microbes and
nanomeds, you sound almost... passionate

79
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,302
I'm sorry.

80
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:42,336
That was rude.

81
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:44,790
Look, nobody expects this
to be easy,

82
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:47,936
us working together
after being... so close.

83
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,854
We were close?

84
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:52,194
Look, if I could be more...

85
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,953
whatever, you know...

86
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:58,102
- I'm... just...
- Don't.

87
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:00,480
It's not your fault, really.

88
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:02,399
You're just a by-product...

89
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:05,314
of my inexplicable obsession
with emotionally distant men.

90
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,309
I'll get over us.

91
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,186
Good for you.

92
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:13,063
Anyway, I'm just really stressed
about this review.

93
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,090
If we don't get impressive results today,
we're gonna have a really hard sell come Tuesday.

94
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,314
Well, then, let's go be impressive.

95
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:04,314
Harper?

96
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:07,114
Ready when you are.
Let's hit it.

97
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,560
Are we passing inspection?

98
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:15,938
Safeties all going green.

99
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:17,894
Countdown's started.

100
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:22,843
Nanomeds released.

101
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:26,718
Four seconds.

102
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:32,318
Okay, nanomeds fully dispersed.

103
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:37,421
Okay, let's hit Freddie
with the gamma radiation.

104
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:51,806
Gamma exposure.

105
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,451
Nanomeds now active.

106
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:02,164
Nanomeds replicating cells on border.

107
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,121
It's working.

108
00:15:07,496 --> 00:15:11,179
Cell copy to disassemble ratio
holding within one percent.

109
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:20,769
Imbalanced nanomed activity.

110
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:35,193
You wanna go to the review board
on Monday and tell 'em...

111
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:37,879
we've developed a brand-new
method for exploding frogs?

112
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:41,063
Yeah, I think maybe
there's a market for it.

113
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:43,363
I mean, what if there's a plague?

114
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,973
What have you had, Betty,
like, one beer?

115
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,888
I'm just sa...
I'm just saying, you know,

116
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,306
frogs start falling from the sky,

117
00:15:51,344 --> 00:15:53,569
who do they come to?

118
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:55,564
We'd be world-renowned.

119
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:57,711
Make any parents proud.

120
00:15:58,863 --> 00:16:00,704
I bet they would be.

121
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,619
They actually did
want me to be a scientist.

122
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,650
I mean, your birth parents.

123
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:10,217
Guess we'll never know.

124
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:15,972
I don't understand why you don't
want to find out about them.

125
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,348
They're dead. They died before
I can remember anything.

126
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:22,148
Why do you always
come back to this?

127
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:24,374
Don't know.

128
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,673
I guess I figure there's more
to you than you like to show.

129
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:30,664
I guess there couldn't be any less

130
00:16:31,854 --> 00:16:34,692
Right. So now we come
full circle back to that.

131
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,649
Nice work, Betty.

132
00:16:49,462 --> 00:16:51,379
Betty.

133
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:54,027
- Glen.
- Hey.

134
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:58,017
Hi.

135
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,487
What happened
to your uniform?

136
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,616
Oh, I, uh...
I switched over.

137
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,034
I'm still working with your father, but...

138
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:09,525
Well, you know, the military's subcontracting
out all the most interesting work, and...

139
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,938
Can't argue with a paycheck.

140
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:15,816
I basically run
all the labs on the base now.

141
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:17,734
Oh.

142
00:17:19,307 --> 00:17:21,378
Hey, you're uh...

143
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:23,374
you're looking good.

144
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:31,315
You're the genetics expert.

145
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:44,856
Ah, the good old college days.

146
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:48,156
So, how's business?

147
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:51,953
What do you want?

148
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,288
All right, I'll cut to the chase.

149
00:17:56,364 --> 00:17:59,165
I've been hearing interesting things
about what you guys are doing here

150
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,962
Your little molecular machines
have some incredible implications.

151
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,916
How would you like to
come work for Atheon?

152
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:08,794
Get paid 10 times as much
as you earn now...

153
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,479
and own a piece of the patents.

154
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:15,085
You just have to say the word.

155
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,119
Two words: The door.

156
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,411
General?

157
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:39,521
Come in.

158
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:43,089
Talbot wanted you to see this, sir.

159
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,964
It's about a lab Atheon is targeting for
acquisition and removal to desert base

160
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,263
Why isn't it
going through N.S.C.?

161
00:18:52,027 --> 00:18:55,480
It, uh, concerns
your daughter, sir.

162
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:05,300
Hi. Sorry.

163
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:10,939
Hey, what happened to Benny? Is he
not working the night shift anymore?

164
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,896
Benny's dead.

165
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:15,122
I'm the new guy.

166
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,154
Oh.

167
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:20,607
Good to meet you.
Same.

168
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:45,964
Let's try another.

169
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,726
Mmm, no. Stay here.

170
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:50,835
I look tired anyway.

171
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:52,985
Yeah, but you look great.

172
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:57,434
What's the matter?

173
00:19:57,473 --> 00:19:59,889
It's these dreams, Doctor.

174
00:20:00,004 --> 00:20:03,149
I keep having them,
and they're terrible.

175
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:06,756
Tell me about your dream.

176
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:11,628
Well, it starts...

177
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,851
it starts with a memory...
I think it's my first memory.

178
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:17,804
It's this image I have...

179
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:20,566
from when I was
maybe two years old.

180
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:53,327
Do you think
it's just a dream?

181
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:55,591
No, I think it's something
that happened...

182
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,544
when I was living at a desert base
with my father.

183
00:20:59,503 --> 00:21:01,422
Anyhow,

184
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:03,877
the dream goes on and...

185
00:21:03,915 --> 00:21:05,680
suddenly I'm alone.

186
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:41,586
That's terrible.

187
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:43,964
You know I'd never hurt you.

188
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:19,986
Hey there.

189
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:22,979
What's your name, darlin'?

190
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:25,741
Eh? What's your name?

191
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:28,810
Okay.

192
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:30,804
It's okay.

193
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,677
I gotta talk to you, Edith.

194
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,788
Bruce, stay here!

195
00:25:37,742 --> 00:25:40,618
"C... T... G...

196
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:43,764
A... G."

197
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:47,754
Bruce.

198
00:25:53,738 --> 00:25:55,579
My Bruce.

199
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:07,011
Good morning.
Glen dropped by.

200
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,929
What's he doing here?

201
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:10,617
You know, Dr. Krenzler,

202
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,533
you and I have never had the chance
to get to know each other properly.

203
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:17,445
Well, that's because I don't want to get
to know you, properly or improperly.

204
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:21,320
So leave.

205
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:23,277
Hey, no worries.

206
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,404
Let me give you a little heads-up.

207
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:36,779
There is a hairsbreadth
between friendly offer...

208
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:38,660
and hostile takeover.

209
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:42,534
I've done my homework. The work
you're doing here is dynamite.

210
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:45,410
Think: Gls embedded with technology...

211
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:47,867
that makes them instantly
repairable on the battlefield...

212
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:49,976
in our sole possession.

213
00:26:51,012 --> 00:26:53,352
That's a hell of a business.

214
00:26:53,391 --> 00:26:57,112
Well, it's not what we're doing here.
We're doing the basic science for everyone

215
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:01,524
You know, someday
I'm gonna write a book...

216
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:06,356
and I'm gonna call it When Stupid Ideals
Happen To Smart, Penniless Scientists.

217
00:27:07,316 --> 00:27:10,346
In the meantime, Bruce,
you will be hearing from me.

218
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:33,862
About Glen, I, um...

219
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:36,470
There's nothing to talk about.

220
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:40,614
Okay.

221
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:44,488
I just wanted to say, don't worry
about him... I'll handle it.

222
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,746
How?

223
00:27:49,782 --> 00:27:51,739
I'm gonna call my father,

224
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,731
ask him to exert some pressure.

225
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:57,992
Last I heard, you and your father
weren't speaking.

226
00:27:58,027 --> 00:27:59,910
Hmm.

227
00:27:59,987 --> 00:28:01,866
Well...

228
00:28:01,904 --> 00:28:04,437
I guess now I have something
to talk with him about.

229
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:06,777
I think this circuit's kinda fried.

230
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:09,615
I don't know. Maybe you
anna come take a look at it

231
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:11,879
Okay, I'll be right there.

232
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:21,047
Aah!

233
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:40,573
The gamma's too high!
Bruce, I can't stop it!

234
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:45,100
Harper, get out!

235
00:28:45,135 --> 00:28:47,747
Get out!

236
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:14,294
How's Harper?

237
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:16,211
He's all right.

238
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,130
You saved him.

239
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:22,004
I don't think he's coming back
to the lab for a while, though.

240
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,484
I don't understand
how this is possible.

241
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:32,324
You should be dead.

242
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,809
They worked... the nanomeds.

243
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:39,804
I mean, I feel great.

244
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:43,257
I feel like... I don't know.
They must have, like, fixed me.

245
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:46,671
Bruce, they've killed everything else
that they've come into contact with.

246
00:29:48,973 --> 00:29:50,852
Are you sure
the doctor checked?

247
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,735
The doctor gave me
the full workup.

248
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,957
He wants to know where
he can get what I'm taking.

249
00:29:55,033 --> 00:29:56,914
I'm a hundred percent.

250
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,829
More.

251
00:29:59,944 --> 00:30:02,130
What do you mean?

252
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:04,048
Remember my bad knee?

253
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,350
Well, now it's my good knee.

254
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,844
Bruce, this isn't funny.

255
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,838
I was watching you.

256
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:16,170
You were gonna die,
and I was gonna have to watch you die.

257
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,778
Betty...

258
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:20,812
I'm sorry.

259
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:24,879
Really.

260
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,449
Hey, I'm not gonna explode.
Okay?

261
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:30,327
Yeah.

262
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:33,357
You should get some rest.

263
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:35,352
And I'm fine. Really.

264
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:38,574
I've never felt better.

265
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:41,449
Your name is not Krenzler.

266
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:43,712
It's Banner.

267
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:48,853
- What?
- Your name...

268
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:50,580
it's Banner.

269
00:31:50,848 --> 00:31:52,228
Bruce Banner.

270
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:55,068
Bruce.

271
00:31:56,602 --> 00:31:59,172
How did you get in here?
I work here now.

272
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:01,896
In the labs.
The late shift.

273
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:05,731
It keeps me close to you.

274
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:09,951
You always work so late yourself
with your friend Miss Ross.

275
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:13,213
No, no. Please. Please.
Let me.

276
00:32:16,627 --> 00:32:18,698
You're not well.

277
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:21,421
You've had a terrible accident.

278
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:26,332
You're wondering
why you're still alive.

279
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:31,319
You're thinking
there's something inside.

280
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:34,657
Something different...

281
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,262
inexplicable.

282
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,521
I can help you understand,

283
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:44,516
if you'll let me.

284
00:32:46,126 --> 00:32:48,045
If you'll...

285
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:50,961
forgive me.

286
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:59,323
Look, mister, I'm sure I have
nothing to forgive you for.

287
00:33:00,705 --> 00:33:02,583
So perhaps you should leave now.

288
00:33:02,698 --> 00:33:04,540
I'll be fine.

289
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:06,458
You must know.

290
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:08,684
You may not want to believe it,

291
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,251
but I can see it in your eyes.

292
00:33:13,402 --> 00:33:15,819
So much like your mother's.

293
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:19,501
Of course,
you're my flesh and blood.

294
00:33:19,578 --> 00:33:23,490
But then, you're something else too,
aren't you?

295
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,716
My physical son,

296
00:33:26,675 --> 00:33:29,246
but the child of my mind too.

297
00:33:29,322 --> 00:33:31,164
No.

298
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,043
You're lying.

299
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:35,920
My parents died
when I was a small boy.

300
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:39,335
No, no, that's not true.
That's what they wanted you to believe.

301
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:42,480
The experiments, the accident...
all top secret.

302
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,472
They put me away for 30 years.

303
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:47,890
Thirty years!

304
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:50,959
Away from you.

305
00:33:51,035 --> 00:33:52,914
Away from our work.

306
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,911
But they couldn't keep me forever.

307
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:58,630
After all, I'm sane.
They had to admit it.

308
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:02,735
You see,

309
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:04,692
everything...

310
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:06,955
your extraordinary mind...

311
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:09,870
has been seeking all these years...

312
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,364
it's been inside you.

313
00:34:13,323 --> 00:34:15,471
Now we will understand it.

314
00:34:15,548 --> 00:34:17,888
We will harness it.

315
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:22,030
No, don't answer it.
It's Miss Ross again.

316
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:26,365
There's something you need to know
about her, Bruce. Something troublesome

317
00:34:26,404 --> 00:34:28,937
Let me protect you from her.

318
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:31,430
No. Get out.

319
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:33,809
- Bruce...
- Get out!

320
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:35,726
Sit!

321
00:34:52,528 --> 00:34:55,597
We're gonna have to
watch that temper of yours.

322
00:35:33,537 --> 00:35:35,302
You sure you're okay?

323
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:37,296
Yeah, just glad to be out of bed

324
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:40,941
Got a message from my father.

325
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:42,898
He's coming to see me.

326
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,816
Your father?

327
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,430
When?

328
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:48,422
Lands in about an hour.

329
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:52,258
The funny thing is, he called me.

330
00:36:02,653 --> 00:36:05,647
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, Betty.

331
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:16,847
- Here, ma'am.
- Thanks.

332
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,268
- You're welcome. Sir?
- Thank you.

333
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:19,686
You're welcome.

334
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:31,311
Look, I'm gonna get right to it.

335
00:36:31,387 --> 00:36:33,382
It's about Glen, isn't it?

336
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:37,639
He's been snooping around my lab.

337
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,559
Glen noticed some things,

338
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:42,359
asked me to make some inquiries.

339
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:45,811
Are you here to...

340
00:36:45,964 --> 00:36:47,806
question me?

341
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:49,302
No.

342
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,065
We've turned up
some surprising things.

343
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,706
This Krenzler you work with...

344
00:36:56,783 --> 00:36:59,237
you know who he really is?

345
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:03,150
How much do you
actually know about him?

346
00:37:03,189 --> 00:37:05,993
I think the question is,

347
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:08,752
what is it
that you know about him?

348
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:15,733
- Well, right now, I'm not...
- Not at liberty to disclose it to me. Right

349
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:18,801
You know,

350
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,621
I think I was hoping that...

351
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,403
maybe this time you just...

352
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,702
honestly wanted to see me again.

353
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:30,272
- You've got this all wrong, Betty.
- Do I?

354
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:34,109
Yes. I do want to see you.

355
00:37:36,372 --> 00:37:39,363
I really wishthat I
could believe you.

356
00:38:24,899 --> 00:38:26,894
Everything...

357
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:30,270
your extraordinary mind
has been seeking...

358
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:32,610
all these years,

359
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,219
it's been inside you.

360
00:38:53,172 --> 00:38:55,243
Hi, you've called Dr. Krenzler.

361
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,198
Please leave a message
and I'll call you right back.

362
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:02,992
Bruce, hey. Are you there?

363
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:05,409
Look, um,
I think I screwed up.

364
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:09,859
My father... It's like he suspects
you of something. I don't know.

365
00:39:09,937 --> 00:39:12,928
I was so impatient, like always.

366
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:15,766
I didn't hear him out.
I don't know, I...

367
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:19,105
I just think that they're planning
something with the lab.

368
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:20,831
So, um, uh...

369
00:39:20,907 --> 00:39:22,673
Call me. Okay?

370
00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:24,513
Bye.

371
00:39:26,432 --> 00:39:27,545
Betty?

372
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,525
Dispatch! Dispatch!
We have a 415 at the lab!

373
00:41:03,603 --> 00:41:05,827
Send Berkeley P.D. Now!
Send 'em now!

374
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:33,946
Watch out!

375
00:42:36,245 --> 00:42:38,470
Edith?

376
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:40,388
David, what's going on?

377
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:43,496
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

378
00:43:14,376 --> 00:43:16,487
My Bruce.

379
00:43:30,029 --> 00:43:31,947
Bruce?

380
00:44:06,779 --> 00:44:09,196
There was some sort of explosion.

381
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,613
They wouldn't let us
into the building.

382
00:44:12,955 --> 00:44:15,295
I was worried about you.

383
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:17,751
Well, I'm okay.

384
00:44:19,593 --> 00:44:21,471
What happened to you last night?

385
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:25,346
I had the most vivid dream.

386
00:44:26,574 --> 00:44:29,374
It was like being born.

387
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:32,060
Coming up for air.
Light hitting my face.

388
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,054
Screaming.

389
00:44:35,013 --> 00:44:37,354
My heartbeat...

390
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:39,885
it was, like, boom...

391
00:44:39,962 --> 00:44:41,843
boom...

392
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:46,445
boom.

393
00:44:51,432 --> 00:44:53,312
Were you at the lab?

394
00:44:53,351 --> 00:44:55,268
No.

395
00:44:56,535 --> 00:44:58,453
But something...

396
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:02,634
And there was that man.

397
00:45:02,711 --> 00:45:04,552
The one with the dogs.

398
00:45:04,628 --> 00:45:06,509
Who?

399
00:45:07,889 --> 00:45:10,460
That new janitor.

400
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,761
He said he was my father.

401
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:19,742
I'll get it.

402
00:45:29,564 --> 00:45:31,482
My father.

403
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,684
My, my.

404
00:45:42,722 --> 00:45:44,869
So this is the young Bruce Ban...

405
00:45:47,018 --> 00:45:49,358
Krenzler.

406
00:45:50,855 --> 00:45:54,614
I think you left something
in your lab last night.

407
00:45:56,609 --> 00:45:58,296
Mitchell.

408
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:01,059
Escort my daughter outside.
I'll join her shortly.

409
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,435
I'd rather stay here.

410
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,890
Now, Betty.

411
00:46:08,194 --> 00:46:10,074
It's okay.

412
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:11,992
I'll be fine.

413
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,996
Keep him under observation.
I'll be back.

414
00:46:32,093 --> 00:46:35,008
- What?
- Your friend in there.

415
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:38,616
There's a good chance he's caught
up in some very bad business.

416
00:46:38,692 --> 00:46:40,533
Unfinished business.

417
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,602
And I promise you, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

418
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,479
You have my word
I'll make sure he's cared for.

419
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:49,356
But as of right now,
he is incommunicado.

420
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:51,735
And for the next
few days at least,

421
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,615
you're gonna stay away from here.

422
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,610
For your own good.

423
00:47:03,704 --> 00:47:07,233
Okay, and that's for the new guy
on the night shift, right?

424
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:10,148
Great. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

425
00:47:26,835 --> 00:47:28,754
Dr. Ross.

426
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:31,631
How unexpected.

427
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:33,627
Please come in.

428
00:47:38,728 --> 00:47:42,180
I'm sorry to just show up
at your house like this.

429
00:47:42,257 --> 00:47:44,213
Uh...

430
00:47:47,014 --> 00:47:49,431
I came to ask you something that...

431
00:47:49,508 --> 00:47:53,075
I really have no business asking

432
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,912
He told you?

433
00:47:56,988 --> 00:47:58,905
He said you talked to him.

434
00:47:58,983 --> 00:48:00,863
Oh.

435
00:48:00,901 --> 00:48:02,820
Please sit down.

436
00:48:10,914 --> 00:48:14,558
Bruce was at the lab last night.
He said that you were there too.

437
00:48:14,635 --> 00:48:17,397
But he can't remember much about it

438
00:48:17,473 --> 00:48:19,546
I need to find out what happened.

439
00:48:19,622 --> 00:48:21,578
So, you want to know, uh,

440
00:48:21,613 --> 00:48:23,535
what's wrong with him...

441
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:26,450
so you can fix him?

442
00:48:26,565 --> 00:48:28,828
Cure him, change him.

443
00:48:30,746 --> 00:48:33,048
My father's with the military.

444
00:48:33,124 --> 00:48:35,926
He seems to think he's involved in
some kind of threat to national security

445
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,881
Mmm.

446
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:41,180
Your father. Ross.

447
00:48:42,178 --> 00:48:45,822
You brought your father
down upon his head?

448
00:48:45,899 --> 00:48:48,777
How little you understand,
Miss Ross,

449
00:48:48,815 --> 00:48:52,536
and how dangerous
your ignorance has become.

450
00:48:54,185 --> 00:48:56,334
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

451
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,366
My son is...

452
00:48:59,787 --> 00:49:01,665
unique.

453
00:49:01,704 --> 00:49:03,546
That's why you can't relate to him.

454
00:49:03,622 --> 00:49:08,073
And because he is unique, the world
will not tolerate his existence.

455
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,991
Will they?

456
00:49:11,064 --> 00:49:12,983
But you...

457
00:49:14,555 --> 00:49:16,205
you try,

458
00:49:16,282 --> 00:49:18,123
don't you?

459
00:49:18,201 --> 00:49:20,156
Yes.

460
00:49:25,144 --> 00:49:28,519
And a very beautiful
woman like you,

461
00:49:28,596 --> 00:49:31,204
your attentions...

462
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:34,811
can't be completely unwanted.

463
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,227
Can they?

464
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:40,680
No.

465
00:49:40,718 --> 00:49:44,055
Not with eyes like yours,

466
00:49:44,094 --> 00:49:46,895
watching expectantly,

467
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:49,887
lovingly.

468
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,104
But I'm afraid
we're both too late to help him.

469
00:49:55,181 --> 00:49:57,290
There's nothing
I can do for him...

470
00:49:57,367 --> 00:49:59,439
or for you.

471
00:49:59,516 --> 00:50:01,433
Besides,

472
00:50:02,661 --> 00:50:05,192
he's made it clear he wants
nothing to do with me.

473
00:50:05,308 --> 00:50:07,111
His choice.

474
00:50:07,226 --> 00:50:10,870
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miss Ross,
I have some work to do.

475
00:50:10,948 --> 00:50:14,016
And don't worry about the dogs.

476
00:50:14,131 --> 00:50:15,935
You'll be fine.

477
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,466
Just don't look 'em in the eyes.

478
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:22,685
Good-bye.

479
00:50:24,643 --> 00:50:27,980
He gets released, and a month later
your lab is destroyed.

480
00:50:28,057 --> 00:50:29,859
What a coincidence.

481
00:50:29,974 --> 00:50:32,776
So you're not gonna tell me
where he is, are ya?

482
00:50:32,852 --> 00:50:35,921
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'd like to help you, but I just don't know

483
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,222
You know who I am.
Right, Banner?

484
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:40,984
- Your Betty's father. You're a
high-ranking general. - Let's cut the crap.

485
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:44,706
I'm the guy who had your father
tossed away, and a lot more like him,

486
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:48,273
and I'll do the same with you if I
feel so disposed. You understand?

487
00:50:48,388 --> 00:50:50,651
If you had him tossed away,
then why are you asking me?

488
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:54,604
I don't remember.
I was always told my father was dead.

489
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,559
Don't play with me!

490
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,938
You were four years old
when you saw it.

491
00:50:59,052 --> 00:51:01,393
When I saw what?

492
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:05,114
You were right there. How could
anyone forget a thing like that?

493
00:51:06,265 --> 00:51:08,106
What?

494
00:51:08,183 --> 00:51:11,061
Oh, some more repressed memories.

495
00:51:14,014 --> 00:51:15,932
Just tell me.

496
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,995
I'm sorry, son.

497
00:51:21,955 --> 00:51:25,330
You're an even more screwed-up mess
than I thought you'd be.

498
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,707
Until we get
to the bottom of this,

499
00:51:28,744 --> 00:51:31,622
your lab has been declared
a top-secret military site...

500
00:51:31,661 --> 00:51:34,921
and you're not gonna get
a security clearance to get back into it...

501
00:51:35,036 --> 00:51:37,875
or any other lab that's doing
anything more interesting than...

502
00:51:37,914 --> 00:51:41,289
trying to figure out
the next generation of herbal hair gel.

503
00:51:44,742 --> 00:51:46,698
One more thing.

504
00:51:46,775 --> 00:51:48,655
If you ever...

505
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:53,181
come within a thousand yards
of my daughter again,

506
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,289
I'll put you away for the
rest of your natural life.

507
00:52:10,022 --> 00:52:11,863
Dogs!

508
00:52:13,858 --> 00:52:16,659
Go! Go get her!

509
00:52:16,735 --> 00:52:19,613
And let nothing stand in your way!

510
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,876
Go!

511
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,212
Hello?

512
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,129
Bruce?

513
00:53:27,206 --> 00:53:31,042
So, they think they can just
throw you away as they did me.

514
00:53:39,021 --> 00:53:41,592
What's wrong with me?
What did you do to me?

515
00:53:41,669 --> 00:53:43,510
I got a visit today.

516
00:53:43,586 --> 00:53:45,850
A very unwelcome visit.

517
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,382
I'm afraid my hand is being forced

518
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:51,488
What did you do to me?

519
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:54,366
You so much want to know, don't you?

520
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:58,471
But I think no explanation
will serve you half as well...

521
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,925
as the experience.

522
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,606
In any case, I still don't
quite understand it myself.

523
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:08,487
If they'd only let me
work in peace...

524
00:54:08,522 --> 00:54:11,591
Of course, my betters
would have none of that.

525
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:14,467
So you experimented
on yourself, didn't you?

526
00:54:14,545 --> 00:54:18,074
And passed on to me... what?

527
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,567
An alteration. Genetic.

528
00:54:20,682 --> 00:54:24,787
A deformity.
I guess you could call it that.

529
00:54:24,863 --> 00:54:27,281
But an amazing strength too.

530
00:54:27,357 --> 00:54:30,235
And now, finally unleashed,
I can harvest it.

531
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:32,076
No.

532
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,032
You'll do no such thing.

533
00:54:34,109 --> 00:54:36,488
I will isolate it
and treat it myself.

534
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:39,825
I'll remove it and I'll kill it
before it does any real harm.

535
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:42,625
I'll bet you and your Betty
would love to destroy it.

536
00:54:42,702 --> 00:54:45,770
But would you really
destroy part of yourself?

537
00:54:46,768 --> 00:54:49,301
I don't think so.

538
00:54:49,377 --> 00:54:51,218
And as for Betty,

539
00:54:51,294 --> 00:54:53,213
I'm sending her a surprise visit...

540
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:55,592
from some four-legged
friends of mine.

541
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:59,965
You see, I managed to culture
some of your very own DNA, Bruce,

542
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:02,611
and the results are tremendous.

543
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:06,293
They're unstable, but very powerful.

544
00:55:07,675 --> 00:55:09,786
What about my DNA?

545
00:55:09,862 --> 00:55:13,737
Let's just wait and see what Betty
makes of the results, huh?

546
00:55:13,813 --> 00:55:15,654
No. You're crazy.

547
00:55:15,731 --> 00:55:17,611
I won't let you.

548
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:23,134
Get your hands off of me.
Talbot, what's this...

549
00:55:23,212 --> 00:55:25,398
Inside, asshole.
I wanna talk to you.

550
00:55:25,476 --> 00:55:27,316
Listen, my father's
going after Betty...

551
00:55:27,431 --> 00:55:30,539
What makes you think you can go behind
my back and get Ross to cut me out, huh?

552
00:55:30,616 --> 00:55:33,838
Listen to me!
Betty's in trouble!

553
00:55:37,061 --> 00:55:38,979
You pathetic freak.

554
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:41,318
Betty's in danger.
I swear to you, she'll be killed.

555
00:55:41,357 --> 00:55:43,199
I can state the obvious.

556
00:55:43,275 --> 00:55:46,459
Something tells me you aren't in much of a
position to be making stupid threats to anyone

557
00:55:51,216 --> 00:55:53,211
- Talbot.
- Yeah?

558
00:55:53,287 --> 00:55:55,090
You're making me angry.

559
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,392
Oh, am I?

560
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,792
Ohh! Oh!

561
00:56:50,831 --> 00:56:53,055
I got him! Open fire!

562
00:58:38,704 --> 00:58:41,312
Bruce?

563
01:03:54,689 --> 01:03:57,835
He sent these dogs, didn't he?

564
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:00,251
But I killed them!

565
01:04:24,112 --> 01:04:26,069
My God.

566
01:04:26,145 --> 01:04:28,716
It must be the nanomeds.
It must be the gamma exposure.

567
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:31,440
But we've never seen
any effect like this before.

568
01:04:31,517 --> 01:04:33,358
No. Deeper.

569
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:36,848
The gamma just unleashed
what was already there.

570
01:04:36,925 --> 01:04:39,381
Unleashed what?

571
01:04:39,457 --> 01:04:42,334
Me.

572
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:45,019
It.

573
01:04:45,096 --> 01:04:47,513
It's okay.

574
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:49,201
Shh. It's okay.

575
01:04:50,927 --> 01:04:53,498
What were those animals?

576
01:04:53,574 --> 01:04:56,413
My father sent them.

577
01:04:56,529 --> 01:04:59,137
He is my father.

578
01:04:59,213 --> 01:05:01,208
He wanted me to change.

579
01:05:01,284 --> 01:05:04,469
He wanted me to change
into that mindless hulk.

580
01:05:04,546 --> 01:05:06,617
Why would he want that?

581
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,108
Can you remember anything?

582
01:05:10,146 --> 01:05:13,331
Is there anything
from when you were changed?

583
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:18,816
It was like a dream.

584
01:05:18,892 --> 01:05:21,655
About what?

585
01:05:22,959 --> 01:05:24,878
Rage.

586
01:05:26,296 --> 01:05:28,215
Power.

587
01:05:29,711 --> 01:05:32,089
And freedom.

588
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:52,383
Hello? Sir.

589
01:05:53,764 --> 01:05:55,682
- Hello.
- Dad?

590
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,983
Betty! Are you all right?

591
01:06:00,131 --> 01:06:03,585
I'm scared.
I need your help.

592
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:05,617
Where are you?

593
01:06:15,592 --> 01:06:17,855
How are you?

594
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,426
Okay, I guess.

595
01:06:23,955 --> 01:06:26,218
I think that somehow...

596
01:06:26,294 --> 01:06:29,405
your anger is triggering
the nanomeds.

597
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:33,737
How could it? We designed them
to respond to physical damage.

598
01:06:33,813 --> 01:06:36,767
Emotional damage
can manifest physically.

599
01:06:38,109 --> 01:06:40,182
Like what?

600
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:45,246
Serious trauma.

601
01:06:47,048 --> 01:06:49,005
Repressed memories.

602
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:58,864
Your father grilled me about something that
happened to me from early childhood...

603
01:06:58,979 --> 01:07:01,166
that I'm supposed to remember.

604
01:07:01,281 --> 01:07:02,623
He did?

605
01:07:02,661 --> 01:07:07,534
It sounded bad,
but... I honestly don't remember.

606
01:07:10,565 --> 01:07:12,981
The thing that worries me...

607
01:07:13,096 --> 01:07:15,015
is...

608
01:07:15,091 --> 01:07:17,086
a physical wound is finite,

609
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:19,004
but with emotions,

610
01:07:19,081 --> 01:07:22,725
what's to say it won't
just go on and on...

611
01:07:22,764 --> 01:07:26,178
and start a chain reaction?

612
01:07:28,248 --> 01:07:30,742
You know what scares me the most?

613
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:34,579
When it happens,

614
01:07:35,692 --> 01:07:37,724
when it comes over me...

615
01:07:37,801 --> 01:07:40,716
and I totally lose control,

616
01:07:42,442 --> 01:07:44,399
I like it.

617
01:08:00,856 --> 01:08:03,388
It's okay. I got you.
I'm sorry.

618
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:07,071
You'll be okay.
It's just to make you sleep.

619
01:08:07,109 --> 01:08:08,913
Target down.
Target secure.

620
01:08:09,028 --> 01:08:11,713
I'm going to take you someplace safe

621
01:08:11,751 --> 01:08:14,897
Okay? Bruce?

622
01:08:14,935 --> 01:08:19,269
Bruce?

623
01:10:46,771 --> 01:10:48,995
Clear!

624
01:10:58,395 --> 01:11:01,041
- Attention on deck.
- Carry on.

625
01:11:08,714 --> 01:11:11,399
We're buried out here
in the middle of nowhere.

626
01:11:11,514 --> 01:11:13,778
How long are you
gonna keep him sedated?

627
01:11:13,893 --> 01:11:16,003
For the rest of his
natural life, if I have to.

628
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,879
You said I could trust you.
I'm your father.

629
01:11:18,918 --> 01:11:23,022
You can trust me to do what I think
is right, not what you think you want

630
01:11:23,061 --> 01:11:26,936
- He is a human being.
- He is also something else.

631
01:11:27,088 --> 01:11:30,465
Suppose he gets out,
has one of his little mood swings...

632
01:11:30,504 --> 01:11:31,845
in a populated area.

633
01:11:31,923 --> 01:11:36,411
Yes, I'm aware of the potential danger.
I'm also aware that he saved my life.

634
01:11:36,446 --> 01:11:39,288
Yeah, from a mutant
French poodle.

635
01:11:39,364 --> 01:11:41,513
I'm indebted to him for that.

636
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:45,004
He also put three men in a hospital,
and Talbot's barely walking!

637
01:11:45,081 --> 01:11:49,147
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to help him!

638
01:11:49,185 --> 01:11:52,868
- Why is he such a threat to you?
- Because I know what he comes from.

639
01:11:52,983 --> 01:11:56,935
He is his father's son,
every last molecule of him.

640
01:11:57,011 --> 01:11:59,466
He says he doesn't know his father

641
01:11:59,505 --> 01:12:04,721
but he's workin'in the same
exact goddamn field his father did.

642
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:08,903
So either he's lyin'...
or it's somethin' worse, and he's...

643
01:12:08,941 --> 01:12:10,898
What?

644
01:12:10,975 --> 01:12:14,619
Predestined to follow
in his father's footsteps?

645
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:18,878
I was gonna say "damned."

646
01:12:18,954 --> 01:12:21,371
Of course you were.

647
01:12:21,409 --> 01:12:22,790
But I'm a scientist.

648
01:12:22,867 --> 01:12:27,201
As a scientist, I believe we can figure
this out and he can be helped.

649
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,424
I know you do.

650
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:33,838
Look, whether you know or care,

651
01:12:33,877 --> 01:12:37,292
I've got a lot of pride
in what you've done.

652
01:12:37,368 --> 01:12:40,245
But this is too big for you.

653
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:44,120
Look, I know the government thinks
they have a weapon on their hands.

654
01:12:44,196 --> 01:12:46,728
Otherwise, he'd be dead by now.

655
01:12:46,766 --> 01:12:49,030
They can probe and prod
all they want,

656
01:12:49,107 --> 01:12:51,292
and in the meanwhile,
just let me try to help him.

657
01:12:51,407 --> 01:12:54,591
Nobody knows him better than I do

658
01:12:57,354 --> 01:13:00,078
What did David Banner do to him?

659
01:13:03,798 --> 01:13:05,640
Cover left!
Clear left.

660
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,558
Cover right!

661
01:15:12,886 --> 01:15:15,687
What's happening here?

662
01:15:15,722 --> 01:15:18,142
My hand.

663
01:15:19,523 --> 01:15:23,551
You see, the strength
of my son's DNA...

664
01:15:23,627 --> 01:15:27,771
combined with nanomed
reconstruction...

665
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:33,985
You see, I can partake
with the essences of all things.

666
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:38,089
Gonna have to ask you to...

667
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:41,083
put your hands up, pal, okay?

668
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:44,419
Nice and easy.

669
01:15:49,138 --> 01:15:51,095
Do you really believe...

670
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:55,698
that I am separate from you?

671
01:15:55,736 --> 01:15:57,961
Whoa!

672
01:16:12,117 --> 01:16:14,035
Where am I?

673
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:19,713
You're home.

674
01:16:31,489 --> 01:16:34,290
It's hard to believe
we used to live here.

675
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:39,660
I must have seen you or known you.

676
01:16:39,738 --> 01:16:42,461
If only I could remember.

677
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:17,639
This is my old house, isn't it?

678
01:17:54,658 --> 01:17:56,652
Let's go.

679
01:17:58,302 --> 01:18:00,182
Please try.

680
01:18:52,162 --> 01:18:54,157
What is it?

681
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:56,189
Nothing.

682
01:18:56,228 --> 01:18:58,185
Really?

683
01:19:00,409 --> 01:19:02,827
Damn it.

684
01:19:07,277 --> 01:19:11,267
Okay, Betty...
what do you want to know?

685
01:19:14,451 --> 01:19:17,059
What was in that room?

686
01:19:27,493 --> 01:19:30,102
What are you afraid that I'll see?

687
01:19:35,089 --> 01:19:38,772
See? There's nothing.

688
01:19:38,848 --> 01:19:41,956
It's empty.

689
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:56,034
What do you mean,
I don't have access to him?

690
01:19:56,073 --> 01:20:01,252
NSA has decided to turn over study
of the, uh... the threat to Atheon.

691
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:03,745
But you're head of the base.

692
01:20:03,784 --> 01:20:06,162
I thought you were in charge.

693
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:10,649
But I don't set policy,
and I still take orders.

694
01:20:12,952 --> 01:20:16,750
I can't believe Talbot
would go around me like this!

695
01:20:18,093 --> 01:20:21,622
Oh, there's a lot of powerful people
that want in on this.

696
01:20:21,698 --> 01:20:24,844
And money to be made...
lots of it.

697
01:20:29,678 --> 01:20:32,746
You know the worst part
about all this?

698
01:20:32,823 --> 01:20:35,739
When I had David Banner locked up
and sent that kid away,

699
01:20:35,815 --> 01:20:39,843
I didn't give that boy a second thought;
he was just collateral damage.

700
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,990
Well, he isn't anymore, is he?

701
01:20:45,176 --> 01:20:47,056
What can I do?

702
01:20:47,094 --> 01:20:50,470
You can go home now.

703
01:20:52,349 --> 01:20:55,380
I'd tell you to go and say good-bye,
but I've already been informed...

704
01:20:55,495 --> 01:20:59,101
that for now all further contact
is out of the question.

705
01:21:00,406 --> 01:21:01,824
Right.

706
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:42,986
Hiya, Bruce. How ya feelin'?
Grub okay in here for ya?

707
01:21:43,025 --> 01:21:45,250
What do you want?

708
01:21:45,327 --> 01:21:47,628
That's a good question.

709
01:21:47,667 --> 01:21:52,232
See, I need your cells to trigger
some chemical distress signals.

710
01:21:52,309 --> 01:21:55,992
You know, so you can turn
a little green for me again...

711
01:21:56,068 --> 01:21:59,176
and I can carve off
a piece of the real you,

712
01:21:59,252 --> 01:22:02,091
analyze it, patent it,
make a fortune.

713
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:05,774
Do you mind?

714
01:22:05,851 --> 01:22:07,998
I'll never let you.

715
01:22:08,075 --> 01:22:10,492
I'm not sure you've got
much of a choice.

716
01:22:12,947 --> 01:22:15,518
Come on, Bruce.
Aren't you feeling a little angry?

717
01:22:15,595 --> 01:22:19,699
After all, you've only got me to play with now
that Betty's dumped you and gone back to Berkeley

718
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:21,464
You're lying.

719
01:22:21,502 --> 01:22:23,804
You know, for me
this is a win-win situation.

720
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:26,182
You turn green, and all these guys
come in and kill you...

721
01:22:26,221 --> 01:22:27,985
and I perform the autopsy.

722
01:22:28,024 --> 01:22:31,054
You don't...

723
01:22:31,131 --> 01:22:32,934
And I mop the floor with you...

724
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:35,850
and maybe by accident
go too far and break your neck.

725
01:22:35,926 --> 01:22:40,031
Bad science, maybe...
but personally gratifying.

726
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:45,785
Come on, Bruce!
Let's see what you got.

727
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:48,356
Never.

728
01:22:53,763 --> 01:22:55,989
You know, consciously
you may control it,

729
01:22:56,066 --> 01:22:59,556
but subconsciously,
I bet that's another story.

730
01:23:28,942 --> 01:23:31,896
All right, let's jump-start
those brain waves.

731
01:23:42,522 --> 01:23:44,401
Bruce.

732
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:59,248
My dear Miss Ross.

733
01:23:59,286 --> 01:24:01,127
Welcome back.

734
01:24:01,204 --> 01:24:03,775
There are two guards
right outside.

735
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:08,762
You don't have to worry.
I'm not angry with you. Not anymore.

736
01:24:08,839 --> 01:24:11,025
What do you want?

737
01:24:11,101 --> 01:24:14,170
It's over for me now.
I know that.

738
01:24:14,247 --> 01:24:17,699
And soon it'll be over for Bruce.

739
01:24:17,776 --> 01:24:20,155
That's why I've come to you...

740
01:24:20,232 --> 01:24:24,259
to ask you if you could
persuade your father,

741
01:24:24,337 --> 01:24:26,983
as a man, as a father himself,

742
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:31,510
that if I turn myself in now,
peacefully...

743
01:24:31,548 --> 01:24:34,962
and before
he puts me away forever,

744
01:24:35,001 --> 01:24:37,764
that he would let me see my son...

745
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,295
for one last time.

746
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:43,057
Could you do that for me?

747
01:24:45,512 --> 01:24:48,082
It's out of my father's hands now.

748
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:55,754
I understand.
He's a puppet now.

749
01:24:56,982 --> 01:24:59,208
I don't blame him.
You shouldn't.

750
01:24:59,246 --> 01:25:02,852
You should blame yourself
for what you've done to your son.

751
01:25:02,928 --> 01:25:06,496
And what have I done
to my son, Miss Ross?

752
01:25:06,573 --> 01:25:11,714
Nothing. I tried to improve
on the limits in myself.

753
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:14,015
Myself! Not him!

754
01:25:14,053 --> 01:25:17,506
Can you understand?
To improve on nature.

755
01:25:17,582 --> 01:25:20,421
My nature!
Knowledge of oneself!

756
01:25:20,498 --> 01:25:23,302
It's the only path to the truth...

757
01:25:23,337 --> 01:25:27,250
that give men the power
to go beyond God's boundaries!

758
01:25:28,209 --> 01:25:32,467
You know what's beyond
your boundaries? Other people.

759
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,459
All you've given Bruce is fear.

760
01:25:37,683 --> 01:25:40,292
Fear of life.

761
01:25:42,364 --> 01:25:44,206
Fear?

762
01:25:45,586 --> 01:25:47,466
Perhaps, Miss Ross.

763
01:25:49,423 --> 01:25:51,725
And loneliness too.

764
01:25:51,763 --> 01:25:56,405
Yes... I feel them both.

765
01:25:59,819 --> 01:26:04,461
But I have lived...
completely once.

766
01:26:06,685 --> 01:26:09,256
I was so much in love,

767
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:12,171
and she so much wanted a baby.

768
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:14,090
My baby.

769
01:26:21,455 --> 01:26:24,178
I could tell
from the moment she conceived...

770
01:26:24,293 --> 01:26:27,132
that it wasn't a son
I had given her...

771
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:29,395
but something else.

772
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:31,774
A monster, maybe.

773
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:34,498
I should have put a stop to it
right then,

774
01:26:34,575 --> 01:26:38,832
but I was curious
and that was my downfall.

775
01:26:38,948 --> 01:26:42,707
And as I watched this tiny life unfold,

776
01:26:42,861 --> 01:26:45,929
I began to imagine the horror of it,

777
01:26:46,006 --> 01:26:50,149
and my curiosity was replaced...

778
01:26:50,226 --> 01:26:53,103
with compassion.

779
01:26:55,328 --> 01:26:57,898
But they took away
my chance to cure him.

780
01:26:57,975 --> 01:27:00,162
Your father threw me out.

781
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:03,614
- What are you doing?
- I remember that day so well...

782
01:27:03,691 --> 01:27:06,376
every moment, every sensation...

783
01:27:06,453 --> 01:27:08,602
walking into the house,

784
01:27:08,679 --> 01:27:11,786
the feeling of the handle
of the knife in my hand.

785
01:27:11,824 --> 01:27:16,658
I knew I was doing a father's work,
fulfilling a father's mercy.

786
01:27:16,693 --> 01:27:19,611
David, please stop it! No!

787
01:27:19,688 --> 01:27:22,066
David, no!
Talk to me! Listen!

788
01:27:22,142 --> 01:27:24,944
But then she surprised me.

789
01:27:24,982 --> 01:27:28,588
No! No!

790
01:27:28,665 --> 01:27:30,621
David, no!

791
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:33,729
It was as if...

792
01:27:33,844 --> 01:27:37,104
she and the knife...

793
01:27:37,181 --> 01:27:39,751
merged.

794
01:27:47,999 --> 01:27:50,109
No!

795
01:27:50,186 --> 01:27:52,755
You cannot imagine...

796
01:27:52,871 --> 01:27:56,323
the unbearable finality of it.

797
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,737
And in that one moment...

798
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:03,842
I took everything that was dear to me...

799
01:28:03,919 --> 01:28:08,100
and transformed it into nothing more...

800
01:28:08,176 --> 01:28:10,096
than a memory.

801
01:28:24,864 --> 01:28:28,049
Bingo! That must be some
jumbo nightmare he just had.

802
01:28:32,537 --> 01:28:34,647
Okay, do it now.
Start the enzyme extraction.

803
01:28:39,211 --> 01:28:41,437
Sir, negative on drill penetration.

804
01:28:41,513 --> 01:28:45,082
Damn it, drill him harder! Give him full RPMs
Come on, Holeman! Come on!

805
01:28:58,584 --> 01:29:02,880
- Should I neutralize?
- No, I can't do anything with goop, c'mon on

806
01:29:14,544 --> 01:29:17,574
All right, put him to sleep.

807
01:29:26,129 --> 01:29:28,314
It's not stopping him!

808
01:29:35,182 --> 01:29:37,522
Ready room, send in
our containment team.

809
01:29:37,598 --> 01:29:40,245
Non-lethals only.
I repeat, non-lethals only.

810
01:29:40,322 --> 01:29:42,432
I must have a sample of him.

811
01:29:42,547 --> 01:29:44,388
Sir!

812
01:29:45,961 --> 01:29:49,337
- Jesus!
- Hit him with the foam.

813
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:51,217
Deploy containment foam.

814
01:29:52,253 --> 01:29:54,132
Talbot, talk to me.

815
01:29:55,667 --> 01:29:58,927
Under control, General. I'll let
you know if we need you.

816
01:29:58,966 --> 01:30:01,535
Unacceptable. Unseat your
asses down here immediately.

817
01:30:01,574 --> 01:30:03,608
I want a full-court evacuation now.

818
01:30:03,684 --> 01:30:05,989
I'm shutting you down.
Lockdown.

819
01:30:06,024 --> 01:30:08,749
- Didn't you hear what the general said?
- I said lockdown!

820
01:30:11,318 --> 01:30:13,696
Clear! I need a sample of him!

821
01:30:15,614 --> 01:30:18,798
Take it easy there, buddy.

822
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:22,558
This might give you
a bit of a sting here, Bruce.

823
01:30:34,221 --> 01:30:37,405
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Clear your weapon! Clear it!

824
01:30:37,481 --> 01:30:40,934
- Give me the M2.
- So long, big boy.

825
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:43,273
Clear!

826
01:30:52,787 --> 01:30:55,779
Lockdown the entire facility immediately

827
01:30:59,808 --> 01:31:02,685
Target's still moving towards blue level

828
01:31:02,762 --> 01:31:05,907
Evacuate the main hall.

829
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:13,541
Send in backup, heavy weapons.
Issue general quarters.

830
01:31:13,579 --> 01:31:16,227
Set firing lines left and right!

831
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,835
Heavy weapons, go, go, go!

832
01:31:39,781 --> 01:31:41,852
Contamination, sir.
System readings are redline.

833
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:44,001
Data's on backup power supply.

834
01:31:50,675 --> 01:31:52,786
Incoming!

835
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:01,839
- Shut down all power to the main hall
- Sir?

836
01:32:01,878 --> 01:32:06,327
Show him the way out.
We'll fight him outside.

837
01:34:09,622 --> 01:34:12,575
Driver, stop.
Driver, stop.

838
01:34:19,289 --> 01:34:21,667
Gunner, traverse left!
Traverse left!

839
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,441
Clear back! Clear back!

840
01:35:56,421 --> 01:36:00,449
Mr. President,
I have some bad news, sir.

841
01:36:00,525 --> 01:36:02,405
Let's have it, General.

842
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:05,551
I've briefed the president on Angry Man.
I assume that's what this is about.

843
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:10,153
It is, ma'am. I'm requesting
a National Command Authority override.

844
01:36:10,192 --> 01:36:12,916
Angry Man is unsecure.

845
01:36:12,955 --> 01:36:17,175
I need everything we have at my disposal
in order to stop his movement.

846
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:20,627
You're expecting
civilian casualties, General?

847
01:36:20,704 --> 01:36:22,889
Not if I can help it, ma'am.

848
01:36:22,967 --> 01:36:25,116
Consider it done. Keep us posted.

849
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:13,566
Contact Goodman Control.

850
01:37:13,643 --> 01:37:16,060
Patch data to the assets.

851
01:37:16,137 --> 01:37:18,860
Contact H.Q.

852
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:22,504
Have them initiate
an immediate evacuation...

853
01:37:22,619 --> 01:37:27,568
in vicinity of grid coordinates
653-216...

854
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:02,362
Confirm that the area
has been cleared.

855
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:04,855
Confirm area cleared.

856
01:38:04,894 --> 01:38:07,694
H.Q. Confirms area cleared.
Assets on-line, sir.

857
01:38:07,732 --> 01:38:09,920
Gentlemen, it's time to dig in.

858
01:38:09,996 --> 01:38:13,295
I want this target
stopped in his tracks.

859
01:39:00,865 --> 01:39:02,705
Jesus.

860
01:39:17,283 --> 01:39:20,582
Mayday! Mayday! Ah, shit!

861
01:39:26,222 --> 01:39:30,249
Tango Four is down. Have C-SAR
respond to our 20 ASAP.

862
01:39:30,326 --> 01:39:34,315
We're okay, but, damn it, get him
off us before he tears us apart!

863
01:39:34,393 --> 01:39:36,962
I've got no shot.
Do you have a clear line of fire?

864
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:39,283
Watch it, Tango Flight.

865
01:39:39,318 --> 01:39:41,527
Break left! Break left!

866
01:39:41,566 --> 01:39:44,903
Tango Three, pull back and set up
for a Hellfire shot.

867
01:39:44,941 --> 01:39:47,320
Hold your fire till we draw him off.

868
01:39:47,397 --> 01:39:49,583
Tango One is hot. Gun wazzed.

869
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:52,153
Roger. Going hot. Guns ready.

870
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:59,941
Engage at will.

871
01:40:18,316 --> 01:40:21,158
Tango One, pull back!
Clear my line!

872
01:40:21,193 --> 01:40:24,071
Tango Flight, clear back.
I've got him painted for Hellfire.

873
01:40:24,109 --> 01:40:28,482
Roger that. Tango One clear.
Take the shot.

874
01:40:45,975 --> 01:40:48,968
Tango One, Tango Three.
I have contact.

875
01:40:49,005 --> 01:40:51,383
Holy shit! He's got my missile!

876
01:40:53,225 --> 01:40:55,143
Mayday! Mayday!

877
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:00,898
Mayday! Mayday!
We're hit! We're going down!

878
01:41:03,698 --> 01:41:06,000
Give me a head count.

879
01:41:06,039 --> 01:41:09,107
Tango Three, give me a sit rep.

880
01:41:09,184 --> 01:41:12,751
Our kite's busted up,
but we're okay.

881
01:41:12,790 --> 01:41:16,242
Tango Flight, do you have
eyes on the target?

882
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:19,273
Tango One, I have him in the rocks.

883
01:41:19,312 --> 01:41:22,266
Salvo all. Turn it into a parking lot.

884
01:41:41,791 --> 01:41:44,400
T- bolt, your parking lot is ready.

885
01:41:44,435 --> 01:41:47,009
We're bingo for fuel and ammo.
R. T.B.

886
01:42:12,865 --> 01:42:14,935
T- bolt, this is Goodman Control.

887
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:18,542
Be advised, target not destroyed.
He's on the move again.

888
01:42:18,577 --> 01:42:20,422
Damn!

889
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:22,838
I've got it.

890
01:42:22,877 --> 01:42:24,948
It appears he's heading home.

891
01:42:25,026 --> 01:42:26,867
Launch fast movers.

892
01:42:26,943 --> 01:42:30,434
Have them intercept and engage.

893
01:42:30,511 --> 01:42:32,582
Hello?

894
01:42:32,621 --> 01:42:36,150
Betty, Bruce got out.
He's headed your way...

895
01:42:36,226 --> 01:42:37,877
and probably right for you.

896
01:42:37,953 --> 01:42:40,140
How far from the base are you?

897
01:42:40,216 --> 01:42:43,247
I'm already here.
They're taking his father in now.

898
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:46,930
That's all good news.
Stay there, Betty.

899
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:03,080
Legend One rolling in hot.
Legend Two breaking offleft.

900
01:43:03,157 --> 01:43:07,070
I think I can come back around
for a gun attack.

901
01:43:07,108 --> 01:43:10,330
Acquire a clear target.
Fire at will.

902
01:43:14,511 --> 01:43:18,233
Increase altitude.
Civilian aircraft in vicinity.

903
01:43:21,915 --> 01:43:25,330
Pull up! Pull up!
You're headed for the bridge!

904
01:43:25,407 --> 01:43:29,281
I can't pull up! I can't pull up!

905
01:43:37,108 --> 01:43:40,291
Okay, you've got him now. Take him
on a ride to the top of the world.

906
01:43:40,368 --> 01:43:43,167
Let's see what the thin air
will do for him.

907
01:43:43,245 --> 01:43:45,240
Initiating afterburner.

908
01:44:02,081 --> 01:44:04,037
I'm passing flight level 600.

909
01:44:04,113 --> 01:44:06,223
This is out of my envelope.

910
01:44:06,301 --> 01:44:08,179
Hang in there, Legend.

911
01:44:08,294 --> 01:44:11,594
I can't maintain.
He's all over my aerodynamics.

912
01:44:11,632 --> 01:44:13,742
He'll lose consciousness before you.

913
01:44:17,271 --> 01:44:22,604
Nine-fifty. I can't hold it.
I'm pulling back!

914
01:45:07,103 --> 01:45:09,521
Puny human.

915
01:45:19,187 --> 01:45:21,067
Contact. He's in the water.
All units, weapons hot.

916
01:45:21,144 --> 01:45:23,445
Let's not take any chances.

917
01:45:23,522 --> 01:45:26,784
You are cleared to fire
on target, Legend.

918
01:45:46,961 --> 01:45:48,918
- Dad?
- Betty?

919
01:45:48,994 --> 01:45:51,296
We don't have a choice.

920
01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:53,674
I have to destroy him.

921
01:45:53,751 --> 01:45:57,664
But you can't. You will only fuel
his rage, and you will make him stronger

922
01:45:57,740 --> 01:46:01,999
It's you he's coming for.
You know that.

923
01:46:03,112 --> 01:46:05,567
Then let me go to him.

924
01:46:05,605 --> 01:46:07,523
Please.

925
01:46:08,905 --> 01:46:11,551
Just give him a chance to calm down

926
01:46:35,028 --> 01:46:38,711
This area has been declared
restricted airspace.

927
01:46:38,787 --> 01:46:42,470
All aircraft are ordered
to clear the airspace immediately.

928
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:24,324
Echo, One-niner. Weapons are hot.

929
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,817
Target acquired.
Waiting your orders to engage.

930
01:47:26,855 --> 01:47:29,502
Repeat, waiting
your orders to engage.

931
01:47:29,578 --> 01:47:32,801
Command code yellow.
Hold for authorization.

932
01:47:41,854 --> 01:47:43,773
All units, hold your fire.

933
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:47,110
This is T-bolt to all assets. You have
direct orders to hold your fire.

934
01:47:47,225 --> 01:47:49,603
I repeat, hold your fire.

935
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:51,829
Echo, One-niner. Roger that.

936
01:48:05,371 --> 01:48:07,326
Go go, go, go, go, go!

937
01:48:36,098 --> 01:48:38,937
Hold your fire until my command!

938
01:48:41,392 --> 01:48:43,809
Engine 24 to command.
We are in position now.

939
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:50,943
You found me.

940
01:49:52,284 --> 01:49:54,970
You weren't that hard to find.

941
01:49:56,504 --> 01:49:58,423
Yes, I was.

942
01:51:01,221 --> 01:51:03,100
Let's take a walk.

943
01:51:33,521 --> 01:51:36,667
That's the deal, gentlemen.
He stays on this base...

944
01:51:36,743 --> 01:51:40,925
until we get the final word from C-3
on how to dispose of him.

945
01:51:41,002 --> 01:51:45,720
In the meantime, ifhe does
anything but sit there in that chair,

946
01:51:45,835 --> 01:51:50,516
we're gonna turn on the juice
and he'll be incinerated immediately.

947
01:51:50,592 --> 01:51:52,894
We've established a
200-yard perimeter, sir.

948
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:57,075
If we deploy the electromagnetic array,
there should be no collateral damage.

949
01:51:57,152 --> 01:51:59,877
Here they come!

950
01:52:05,706 --> 01:52:08,047
I'm doin' this for you, Betty.

951
01:52:08,124 --> 01:52:11,960
But one way or another, we're
gonna have to prepare for the worst.

952
01:53:56,726 --> 01:53:58,720
I should have killed you.

953
01:53:59,871 --> 01:54:02,327
And I should have killed you.

954
01:54:03,516 --> 01:54:05,779
I wish you had.

955
01:54:10,268 --> 01:54:12,531
I saw her last night.

956
01:54:14,602 --> 01:54:16,943
Saw her face.

957
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:19,015
Brown hair.

958
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:23,157
Brown eyes.

959
01:54:23,234 --> 01:54:25,957
She smiled at me.

960
01:54:26,034 --> 01:54:29,564
She reached down and kissed my cheek

961
01:54:30,868 --> 01:54:34,014
I can almost remember a smell.

962
01:54:37,044 --> 01:54:39,922
Almost like desert flowers.

963
01:54:41,379 --> 01:54:43,374
Her favorite perfume.

964
01:54:46,097 --> 01:54:50,049
It's my mother,
and I don't even know her name.

965
01:54:57,682 --> 01:55:01,326
It's all right, son.
You go ahead and cry.

966
01:55:08,194 --> 01:55:10,841
Go ahead and cry.

967
01:55:13,641 --> 01:55:16,019
Cry. Crying will do you good.

968
01:55:16,173 --> 01:55:18,819
Don't touch me!

969
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:22,848
Maybe once you were my father,

970
01:55:22,886 --> 01:55:25,533
but you're not now
and you never will be.

971
01:55:25,611 --> 01:55:29,025
Oh, is that so?

972
01:55:29,101 --> 01:55:34,549
Well, I got news for you.
I didn't come here to see you.

973
01:55:34,624 --> 01:55:37,579
I came here to see my son.

974
01:55:38,844 --> 01:55:40,916
My real son.

975
01:55:40,993 --> 01:55:43,371
The one inside of you.

976
01:55:43,409 --> 01:55:47,322
You're nothing but a superficial shell,

977
01:55:47,475 --> 01:55:49,509
a husk of flimsy consciousness...

978
01:55:49,586 --> 01:55:53,346
ready to be torn off
at a moment's notice.

979
01:55:53,383 --> 01:55:56,606
You can think what you like.
I don't care. Just go!

980
01:56:01,938 --> 01:56:05,237
No, son. Listen to me.
I found a cure.

981
01:56:05,352 --> 01:56:07,578
For me.

982
01:56:07,655 --> 01:56:10,727
My cells can transform too,

983
01:56:10,762 --> 01:56:13,562
absorb enormous amounts of energy.

984
01:56:13,716 --> 01:56:16,363
But, unlike you, they're unstable.

985
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:19,585
Son, I need your strength.

986
01:56:19,662 --> 01:56:22,769
I gave you life.

987
01:56:22,884 --> 01:56:26,605
Now you must give it back to me!

988
01:56:26,644 --> 01:56:31,669
Only a million times
more radiant, more powerful!

989
01:56:31,746 --> 01:56:34,968
- Stop it.
- Stop? Stop what?

990
01:56:35,045 --> 01:56:37,692
Stop what?

991
01:56:37,768 --> 01:56:41,911
Think about all those men out there
in their uniforms...

992
01:56:42,026 --> 01:56:45,326
barking and swallowing orders,

993
01:56:45,403 --> 01:56:48,663
inflicting their petty rule
over the entire globe!

994
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:51,808
Think of all the harm they've done!

995
01:56:51,886 --> 01:56:54,762
To you! To me!

996
01:56:54,839 --> 01:56:57,026
To humanity!

997
01:56:57,141 --> 01:56:59,980
And know this...
that we can make them...

998
01:57:00,057 --> 01:57:02,551
and their flags and their anthems
and their governments...

999
01:57:02,588 --> 01:57:05,159
disappear in a flash!

1000
01:57:05,235 --> 01:57:07,306
You in me.

1001
01:57:07,345 --> 01:57:09,494
I'd rather die.

1002
01:57:09,609 --> 01:57:13,944
Oh, that's your answer?

1003
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:18,125
Then indeed you shall die...
and be reborn...

1004
01:57:18,202 --> 01:57:21,501
a hero... of the kind
that walked the earth...

1005
01:57:21,578 --> 01:57:25,145
long before the pale religions
of civilization...

1006
01:57:25,222 --> 01:57:28,329
infected humanity's soul!

1007
01:57:28,405 --> 01:57:31,398
Go!

1008
01:57:44,326 --> 01:57:47,127
Stop your bawling,

1009
01:57:47,164 --> 01:57:50,463
you weak little speck
of human trash.

1010
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:59,440
All right... I'll go!

1011
01:58:01,129 --> 01:58:03,699
- You just watch me go!
- Hit it.

1012
01:58:27,329 --> 01:58:30,284
Hit it again!

1013
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:34,004
We can't, sir. There's no power. Some
kind of counter-electromagnetic field.

1014
01:58:38,493 --> 01:58:40,871
Move in and assault the target.
Move in!

1015
01:58:40,948 --> 01:58:44,094
Move, move, move!

1016
01:59:30,511 --> 01:59:33,925
Sir, I've located them on radar.
Pear Lake.

1017
01:59:34,002 --> 01:59:36,304
Call up the task force.

1018
01:59:42,710 --> 01:59:44,935
Yes!

1019
02:00:46,736 --> 02:00:49,497
That's right. Keep fighting.

1020
02:00:49,575 --> 02:00:53,948
The more you fight,
the more of you I take.

1021
02:01:01,161 --> 02:01:05,917
Strange. We're reading a phenomenal
drop in temperatures there.

1022
02:01:05,955 --> 02:01:08,411
But simultaneous radiological activity.

1023
02:01:08,526 --> 02:01:11,556
They're absorbing
all the ambient energy.

1024
02:01:20,532 --> 02:01:24,522
Sleep now, Bruce, and forget forever.

1025
02:01:24,561 --> 02:01:29,318
Struggle no more...
and give me all of your power.

1026
02:01:31,082 --> 02:01:34,918
You think you can live with it? Take it!

1027
02:01:34,994 --> 02:01:38,525
Take it all!

1028
02:01:40,174 --> 02:01:43,434
Oh, yes! Yes!

1029
02:01:56,324 --> 02:01:59,586
Take it back!

1030
02:01:59,624 --> 02:02:03,306
It's not stopping!

1031
02:02:03,383 --> 02:02:05,531
Take it back!

1032
02:02:20,991 --> 02:02:23,638
Gentlemen... release.

1033
02:02:31,732 --> 02:02:34,609
Gamma charge away.

1034
02:02:55,171 --> 02:02:58,432
- Mwah!
- Sweet dreams.

1035
02:03:49,913 --> 02:03:52,717
- Hello?
- Betty, is that you?

1036
02:03:52,752 --> 02:03:55,208
- Hi, Dad.
- I'm glad I caught you.

1037
02:03:55,284 --> 02:03:58,122
- I'm glad you called.
- Thanks.

1038
02:03:59,734 --> 02:04:03,378
Look, Betty... you and I...

1039
02:04:03,417 --> 02:04:08,442
well, we both know that Bruce
couldn't have survived that blast.

1040
02:04:08,519 --> 02:04:12,470
But... well, you know...

1041
02:04:12,509 --> 02:04:15,424
- What is it?
- Well, you know.

1042
02:04:15,463 --> 02:04:18,838
The usual loonies. Seein' things.

1043
02:04:18,914 --> 02:04:20,795
Only now everything's green.

1044
02:04:20,833 --> 02:04:24,362
Right.

1045
02:04:24,401 --> 02:04:27,315
Look, uh...

1046
02:04:27,354 --> 02:04:30,808
if by some chance
he did survive...

1047
02:04:30,922 --> 02:04:35,334
and he should try to contact you,
try to get in touch,

1048
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:37,943
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

1049
02:04:39,055 --> 02:04:42,738
No... I wouldn't.

1050
02:04:42,776 --> 02:04:46,229
But you know as well as I do,
I wouldn't have to.

1051
02:04:46,344 --> 02:04:49,681
I mean, my phones are bugged,
my computer's tapped.

1052
02:04:49,758 --> 02:04:51,829
I'm under surveillance.

1053
02:04:53,939 --> 02:04:56,509
I'll tell you, though,

1054
02:04:56,547 --> 02:04:58,581
that if he were alive,

1055
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:01,649
I'm the last person
I would want him to come to...

1056
02:05:01,727 --> 02:05:04,948
because... as much as I miss him,

1057
02:05:05,102 --> 02:05:08,977
I... I... loved him.

1058
02:05:09,015 --> 02:05:11,931
I, um...

1059
02:05:12,046 --> 02:05:15,230
Yeah.

1060
02:05:15,268 --> 02:05:17,531
I'm sorry, Betty.

I am so sorry.

1062
