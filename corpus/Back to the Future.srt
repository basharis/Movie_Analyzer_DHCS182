00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,309
<i>October is inventory time</i>.

2
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:36,979
<i>So right now, Statler Toyota is making</i>
<i>the best deals of the year...</i>

3
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,190
<i>on all 1985-model Toyotas.</i>

4
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,983
<i>You won't find a better car...</i>

5
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:44,862
<i>at a better price with better service</i>
<i>anywhere in Hill Valley.</i>

6
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:53,412
<i>The Senate is expected</i>
<i>to vote on this today.</i>

7
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:57,792
<i>In other news, officials at</i>
<i>the Pacific Nuclear research facility...</i>

8
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,920
<i>have denied the rumor</i>
<i>that a case of missing plutonium...</i>

9
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:03,881
<i>was in fact stolen</i>
<i>from their vault two weeks ago.</i>

10
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:07,718
<i>A Libyan terrorist group had claimed</i>
<i>responsibility for the alleged theft.</i>

11
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:12,807
<i>However, officials now attribute</i>
<i>the discrepancy to a simple clerical error.</i>

12
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:16,602
<i>The FBI, which is investigating the matter,</i>
<i>had no comment.</i>

13
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,604
Doc?

14
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:03,441
<i>Doc?</i>

15
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,694
<i>Hello! Anybody home?</i>

16
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,154
<i>Einstein, come here, boy.</i>

17
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:11,365
What's going on? God.

18
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:14,201
<i>Jesus!</i>

19
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:16,662
<i>That is disgusting.</i>

20
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:43,874
Rock 'n' roll.

21
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,885
- Yo.
<i>- Marty, is that you?</i>

22
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:56,012
Doc. Where are you?

23
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,515
<i>Thank God I've found you. Meet me</i>
<i>at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15.</i>

24
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,101
<i>I made a breakthrough.</i>
<i>I'll need your assistance.</i>

25
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:05,479
1:15 in the morning?
Doc, what's going on?

26
00:05:05,563 --> 00:05:07,523
- Where you been all week?
<i>- Working.</i>

27
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:10,735
- Is Einstein with you?
<i>- Yeah, he's right here.</i>

28
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:13,279
You left your equipment on all week.

29
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:15,948
<i>My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.</i>

30
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:19,994
<i>Do not hook up to the amplifier.</i>
<i>There's a slight possibility of overload.</i>

31
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:22,371
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

32
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,832
<i>Good. I'll see you tonight. Don't forget.</i>

33
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,835
<i>- 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.</i>
- Right.

34
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:39,138
<i>- Are those my clocks I hear?</i>
- Yeah, it's 8:00.

35
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,682
<i>Perfect! My experiment worked!</i>

36
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,977
<i>They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!</i>

37
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:47,813
Wait a minute, Doc.

38
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:50,191
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

39
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:52,485
<i>- Precisely.</i>
- Damn!

40
00:05:53,444 --> 00:05:55,321
I'm late for school.

41
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:57,633
- Jennifer.
- Strickland's looking for you.

42
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,386
If you get caught,
it'll be four tardies in a row.

43
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,348
All right, come on. I think we're safe.

44
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:08,978
This time it wasn't my fault.
The doc set all his clocks 25 minutes slow.

45
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,313
The doc?

46
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:14,609
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

47
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,445
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

48
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:21,282
And one for you, McFly.
I believe that's four in a row.

49
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:24,785
Let me give you a nickel's worth
of free advice, young man.

50
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:28,039
This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous.
He's a real nutcase.

51
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:30,750
Hang around with him,
you'll end up in big trouble.

52
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,418
Yes, sir.

53
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:35,796
You got a real attitude problem.
You're a slacker.

54
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:40,384
You remind me of your father
when he went here. He was a slacker, too.

55
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:42,720
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

56
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:46,432
Your band is on the roster for
the dance auditions after school today.

57
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:48,935
Why even bother?
You don't have a chance.

58
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,937
You're too much like your old man.

59
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:54,982
No McFly ever amounted to anything
in the history of Hill Valley.

60
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,195
Yeah, well, history is going to change.

61
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:02,782
<i>Next, please.</i>

62
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,626
<i>All right.</i>

63
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:17,255
<i>We're the Pinheads.</i>

64
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,091
<i>One, two, three.</i>

65
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:42,697
<i>Okay, that's enough. Thank you, fellas.</i>

66
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,949
<i>Hold it, fellas.</i>

67
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,702
<i>I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.</i>

68
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,037
<i>Next, please.</i>

69
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:54,083
<i>Next group, please.</i>

70
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,422
<i>Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson.</i>

71
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,549
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

72
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,551
<i>"</i>Too loud.<i>"</i> I can't believe it.

73
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:06,387
We'll never get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

74
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,931
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

75
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,309
I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

76
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:15,021
But you're really good,
and your audition tape is great.

77
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:17,440
You've got to send it in
to the record company.

78
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,317
- It's like Doc's always saying.
- I know.

79
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,570
If you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

80
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,864
That's good advice.

81
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:28,659
All right. What if I send in the tape
and they don't like it?

82
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:30,620
What if they say I'm no good?

83
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:32,788
What if they say, <i>"</i>You got no future<i>"</i>?

84
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:35,291
I can't take that kind of rejection.

85
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,377
I'm starting to sound like my old man.

86
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:40,463
- He's not that bad.
- Save the clock tower.

87
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:43,341
He's letting you borrow the car
tomorrow night.

88
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,427
Check out that 4x4.

89
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:49,639
- That is hot.
- Back her up.

90
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,059
Someday, Jennifer. Someday.

91
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:56,771
Wouldn't it be great
to take that truck up to the lake?

92
00:09:58,105 --> 00:10:00,900
Throw a couple of sleeping bags
in the back.

93
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:04,403
Lie out underneath the stars.

94
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,280
- Stop it.
- What?

95
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,700
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?

96
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:13,829
No, get out of town. My mom thinks
I'm going camping with the guys.

97
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,916
My mother would freak out
if she knew I was going with you.

98
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,960
I'd get the standard lecture about...

99
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:21,587
how she never did that stuff
when she was a kid.

100
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:24,465
Look, I think the woman was born a nun.

101
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:27,260
She's just trying to keep you respectable.

102
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,470
She's not doing a very good job.

103
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,846
Terrible.

104
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,517
Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.

105
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:38,688
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
an initiative to replace that clock.

106
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:43,150
<i>Thirty years ago, lightning struck that</i>
<i>clock tower and the clock hasn't run since.</i>

107
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:48,072
We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society
think it should be preserved the way it is...

108
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:50,283
<i>as part of our history and heritage.</i>

109
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,159
- There's a quarter.
- Thanks.

110
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,161
Don't forget to take a flyer.

111
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,163
<i>Save the clock tower!</i>

112
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,041
Where were we?

113
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:02,545
- Right about here.
- Jennifer!

114
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,842
It's my dad. I've got to go.

115
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:09,176
I'll call you tonight.

116
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,553
I'll be at my grandma's.

117
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:13,055
Here, let me give you the number.

118
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:19,103
'Bye.

119
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,358
<i>Bravo, Tango, Delta 6-2-9.</i>

120
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:08,194
<i>Tow for impoundment.</i>
<i>Any unit, please respond.</i>

121
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:13,407
Perfect. Just perfect.

122
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:22,124
I can't believe you'd loan me your car...

123
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,335
without telling me it had a blind spot.

124
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,045
I could've been killed.

125
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,589
Now, Biff, I never noticed...

126
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,552
that the car had any blind spot before
when I would drive it.

127
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,053
Hi, son.

128
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:35,930
Are you blind, McFly?

129
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:38,307
<i>How else do you explain</i>
<i>that wreck out there?</i>

130
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,644
Biff, can I assume...

131
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:44,814
that your insurance
is going to pay for the damage?

132
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,191
My insurance? It's your car.

133
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:50,236
Your insurance should pay.
Who's going to pay for this?

134
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:54,365
I spilled beer when the car smashed
into me. Who'll pay my cleaning bill?

135
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:56,325
<i>And where's my reports?</i>

136
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,746
I haven't finished those up yet, but I
figured since they weren't due 'til...

137
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,749
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

138
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,919
Think, McFly. Think!

139
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:08,879
I got to have time to get them retyped.

140
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:13,217
Do you realize what would happen if I
hand in my reports in your handwriting?

141
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:14,886
I'll get fired.

142
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:17,638
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

143
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:19,682
- Would you?
- Of course not.

144
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,226
I wouldn't want that to happen.

145
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,812
<i>Now, look.</i>
<i>I'll finish those reports tonight...</i>

146
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:28,149
and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow.

147
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:30,276
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.

148
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:32,236
Your shoe's untied.

149
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,947
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

150
00:13:35,072 --> 00:13:36,949
<i>Got the place fixed up nice.</i>

151
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:41,203
I have your car towed to your house...

152
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,664
and all you got for me is lite beer?

153
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:52,965
What are you looking at, butthead?

154
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,178
Say hi to your mom for me.

155
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,183
I know what you're going to say, son...

156
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,935
and you're right.

157
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,436
You're right.

158
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,021
But...

159
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,857
Biff just happens to be my supervisor...

160
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:14,737
and I'm afraid I'm just not
very good at confrontations.

161
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:17,531
But the car, Dad.

162
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,702
I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.

163
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:24,956
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.

164
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:28,334
Do you have any idea
how important this was to me?

165
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:31,003
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

166
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,130
I'm sorry.

167
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:35,549
Believe me, Marty, you're better off...

168
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,761
without having to worry
about all the aggravation...

169
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:42,139
and headaches of playing at that dance.

170
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:46,143
He's absolutely right.
The last thing you need is headaches.

171
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:57,905
Kids, we're going to have to
eat this cake by ourselves.

172
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,908
Your Uncle Joey didn't make parole again.

173
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:06,539
It would be nice
if you all dropped him a line.

174
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,332
Uncle <i>"</i>Jailbird<i>"</i> Joey?

175
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,001
He's your brother, Mom.

176
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:13,838
Yeah. It's a major embarrassment,
having an uncle in prison.

177
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:16,215
We all make mistakes in life, children.

178
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,009
Goddamn it. I'm late.

179
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:19,719
David, watch your mouth!

180
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:22,388
You come here and kiss your mother
before you go.

181
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:25,600
Come on, Mom.
Make it fast. I'll miss my bus.

182
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,226
See you later, Pop.

183
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:30,354
Time to change that oil.

184
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:34,525
Marty.

185
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:37,069
I'm not your answering service.

186
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,530
While you were outside
pouting over the car...

187
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:41,616
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

188
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,242
I don't like her.

189
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:46,579
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

190
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:49,582
Mom. There's nothing wrong
with calling a boy.

191
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:53,502
I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys.

192
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,923
When I was your age,
I never chased a boy or called a boy or...

193
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:59,550
sat in a parked car with a boy.

194
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:02,845
Then how am I ever
supposed to meet anybody?

195
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,057
Well, it'll just happen.

196
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,559
Like the way I met your father.

197
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,771
That was so stupid.
Grandpa hit him with the car.

198
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,564
It was meant to be.

199
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:16,150
Anyway...

200
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,987
if Grandpa hadn't hit him,
then none of you would have been born.

201
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:21,656
Yeah, well.

202
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:25,159
I don't understand what Dad was doing
in the middle of the street.

203
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,745
What was it, George? Bird-watching?

204
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:30,373
What, Lorraine? What?

205
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,376
Anyway, your Grandpa
hit him with the car...

206
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,586
and brought him into the house.

207
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:38,422
He seemed so helpless.

208
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:44,220
Like a little lost puppy,
and my heart just went out to him.

209
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,473
Yeah, we know.
You've told us this story a million times.

210
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:48,975
<i>You felt sorry for him.</i>

211
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:52,144
You decided to go with him
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

212
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:55,231
No. It was
the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

213
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,235
Our first date. I'll never forget it.

214
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:03,406
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember, George?

215
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:09,662
Your father kissed me
for the first time on that dance floor.

216
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:14,041
It was then that I realized...

217
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,336
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

218
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,383
Oh, no.

219
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:47,158
Hello.

220
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,994
<i>- Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?</i>
- Doc.

221
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:53,956
No. No, don't be silly.

222
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:57,001
<i>Listen, this is very important.</i>
<i>I forgot my video camera.</i>

223
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:59,921
<i>Can you pick it up at my place</i>
<i>on your way to the mall?</i>

224
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:02,673
Yeah. I'm on my way.

225
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:29,951
Einstein! Where's the doc, boy?

226
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,381
Doc!

227
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:28,926
- Marty! You made it!
- Yeah.

228
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,639
Welcome to my latest experiment. This is
the one I've been waiting for all my life.

229
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,308
Well, it's a DeLorean...

230
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:39,312
All your questions will be answered.
Roll tape and we'll proceed.

231
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:41,772
- Is that a Devo suit?
- Never mind that now.

232
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:44,066
- Not now.
- I'm ready.

233
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:48,613
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.
I'm in the Twin Pines Mall parking lot.

234
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:52,325
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.

235
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,619
<i>This is temporal experiment number one.</i>

236
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:57,705
Come on, Einie. Get in there.

237
00:19:57,872 --> 00:19:59,832
In you go. Sit down.

238
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:02,168
Put your seat belt on.

239
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:09,258
Okay.

240
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:13,221
Please note that Einstein's clock...

241
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:16,265
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

242
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,559
- Got it?
- Right. Check, Doc.

243
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:24,232
Have a good trip, Einstein.
Watch your head.

244
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:32,448
You got that thing hooked up to the car?

245
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,492
- Watch this.
- Yeah. Okay.

246
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:36,035
Got it.

247
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:40,957
Jesus!

248
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,546
Not me! The car!

249
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:07,400
If my calculations are correct...

250
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:10,403
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour...

251
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:13,239
you're going to see some serious shit.

252
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,610
Watch this!

253
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:11,005
What did I tell you?

254
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,550
88 miles per hour!

255
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:22,558
The temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1:20 a.m. And zero seconds!

256
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:26,145
Jesus Christ!

257
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,731
Jesus Christ, Doc!
You disintegrated Einstein!

258
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,359
Calm down. I didn't disintegrate anything.

259
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:35,738
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

260
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,698
Then where the hell are they?

261
00:22:37,782 --> 00:22:40,868
The appropriate question is,
<i>"</i>When the hell are they?<i>"</i>

262
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:45,456
Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

263
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:48,584
I sent him into the future.

264
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:52,004
One minute into the future, to be exact.

265
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:55,258
At precisely 1:21 a.m. And zero seconds...

266
00:22:55,383 --> 00:22:58,386
we shall catch up with him
and the time machine.

267
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:03,766
Wait a minute, Doc.

268
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:08,479
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine...

269
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:11,774
- Out of a DeLorean?
- The way I see it...

270
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:15,945
if you're going to build a time machine
into a car, why not do it with style?

271
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:19,282
Besides, the stainless-steel construction
made the flux dispersal...

272
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:21,993
Look out!

273
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:09,790
- What? Is it hot?
- It's cold. Damn cold.

274
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:15,713
Einstein, you little devil!

275
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:21,761
<i>Einstein's clock is exactly one minute</i>
<i>behind mine and still ticking!</i>

276
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:26,891
- He's okay.
- He's fine.

277
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:29,268
He's completely unaware
that anything happened.

278
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:32,021
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

279
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,732
That's why his watch is exactly
one minute behind mine.

280
00:24:34,815 --> 00:24:38,569
He skipped over that minute to
instantly arrive at this moment in time.

281
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:41,072
I'll show you how it works.

282
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:45,618
First, you turn the time circuits on.

283
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:53,459
This tells you where you're going,
this where you are and this where you were.

284
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:56,003
Input your destination time on this keypad.

285
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:59,715
Say you want to see the signing
of the Declaration of Independence.

286
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,844
Or witness the birth of Christ.

287
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:09,559
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

288
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,395
November 5, 1955.

289
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,650
Yes, of course.

290
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:20,695
November 5, 1955.

291
00:25:21,362 --> 00:25:23,155
What happened?

292
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,617
That was the day I invented time travel.

293
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:28,578
<i>I remember it vividly.</i>

294
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,705
I was standing on my toilet
hanging a clock.

295
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:33,624
The porcelain was wet.
I slipped, hit my head on the sink.

296
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,585
When I came to, I had a revelation.

297
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,380
A vision. A picture in my head.
A picture of this.

298
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,550
<i>This is what makes time travel possible.</i>

299
00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:44,886
The flux capacitor.

300
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,345
Flux capacitor?

301
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,100
It's taken almost 30 years and my family
fortune to realize the vision of that day.

302
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,728
My God, has it been that long?

303
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:56,981
Things have certainly changed around here.

304
00:25:58,232 --> 00:26:02,069
I remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see.

305
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:06,032
Old man Peabody owned all of this.

306
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:11,203
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

307
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:18,419
This is...
This is heavy-duty, Doc. This is great.

308
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,464
Does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

309
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:25,426
Unfortunately, no. It requires something
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

310
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:27,720
Plutonium. Wait a minute.

311
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:30,598
Are you telling me
that this sucker is nuclear?

312
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:32,225
Keep rolling there.

313
00:26:32,308 --> 00:26:34,101
No, this sucker's electrical...

314
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:38,439
but I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.

315
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:41,776
You don't just walk into a store
and buy plutonium.

316
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:44,195
<i>Did you rip that off?</i>

317
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:49,951
Of course. From a group of Libyans.
They wanted me to build them a bomb.

318
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:54,413
I took the plutonium and gave them a
bomb casing full of pinball machine parts.

319
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:57,458
- Come on. Let's get you a radiation suit.
- Jesus!

320
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:29,574
It's safe now. Everything's lead-lined.

321
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:33,369
Don't lose those tapes now.

322
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,413
I need that as a record.

323
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:37,790
Let's put this back here. There we go.

324
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:41,961
Almost forgot my luggage.

325
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:44,880
Who knows if they got
cotton underwear in the future.

326
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:47,967
- I'm allergic to all synthetics.
- The future.

327
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:50,011
- That's where you're going.
- Right.

328
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:54,515
25 years. I've always dreamed of seeing
the future, looking beyond my years...

329
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,726
seeing the progress of mankind.

330
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:58,019
Why not?

331
00:27:58,102 --> 00:28:01,522
I'll also be able to see
who wins the next 25 World Series.

332
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:03,274
Doc.

333
00:28:04,692 --> 00:28:07,069
Look me up when you get there.

334
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,364
Indeed I will. Roll 'em.

335
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:19,540
I, Dr. Emmett Brown...

336
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,419
am about to embark
on an historic journey.

337
00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:27,423
What am I thinking of?

338
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,634
I almost forgot to bring extra plutonium.

339
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,303
How do I expect to get back?
One pellet, one trip.

340
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:34,430
I must be out of my mind.

341
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:38,601
What is it?

342
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:48,194
My God.

343
00:28:48,736 --> 00:28:51,530
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

344
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,824
- Run for it, Marty!
- Who?

345
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:56,494
Who do you think? The Libyans!

346
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:01,540
Holy shit!

347
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,171
I'll draw their fire!

348
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:16,722
Doc, wait!

349
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:32,238
No!

350
00:29:33,155 --> 00:29:34,949
Bastards!

351
00:29:53,718 --> 00:29:54,886
Go!

352
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:02,351
Go!

353
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,061
Come on! Move! Goddamn it!

354
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:48,022
Jesus!

355
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,627
Holy shit!

356
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:13,214
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

357
00:32:04,891 --> 00:32:06,267
Pa, what is it?

358
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:07,894
What is it, Pa?

359
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:11,230
Looks like an airplane without wings.

360
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:14,901
That ain't no airplane. Look.

361
00:32:35,713 --> 00:32:37,089
Don't look!

362
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:38,799
Listen...

363
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:52,230
Hello.

364
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:56,651
Excuse me.

365
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:01,822
Sorry about your barn.

366
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:08,454
It's already mutated into human form!
Shoot it!

367
00:33:10,414 --> 00:33:12,792
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!

368
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:18,589
Wait!

369
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:22,426
Shoot it, Pa!

370
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:27,848
My pine! Why you...

371
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:33,354
You space bastard! You killed my pine!

372
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,610
Okay, McFly.

373
00:33:39,694 --> 00:33:41,904
Get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream.

374
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:44,824
Just a very intense dream.

375
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:30,995
- Listen, you got to help me.
- Don't stop, Wilbur!

376
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:35,082
It can't be.

377
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,757
This is nuts.

378
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:48,471
Come on.

379
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,723
Perfect.

380
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:49,425
<i>Remember, fellow citizens,
the future is in your hands.</i>

381
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,179
<i>If you believe in progress,</i>
<i>re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.</i>

382
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:55,431
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

383
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:58,100
<i>Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform...</i>

384
00:36:58,226 --> 00:37:00,686
<i>means more jobs, better education...</i>

385
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:03,898
<i>bigger civic improvements</i>
<i>and lower taxes.</i>

386
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:07,652
<i>On election day,</i>
<i>cast your vote for a proven leader.</i>

387
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:10,071
<i>Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.</i>

388
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:15,368
This has got to be a dream.

389
00:37:32,385 --> 00:37:34,512
Hey, kid. You jump ship?

390
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:37,890
- What?
- What's with the life preserver?

391
00:37:43,145 --> 00:37:44,772
I want to use the phone.

392
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:46,983
It's in the back.

393
00:37:49,652 --> 00:37:50,987
Brown.

394
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,532
Great. You're alive.

395
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,170
Come on.

396
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:19,557
- Do you know where 1640 Riverside...
- Are you going to order, kid?

397
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:22,685
Yeah.

398
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:24,645
<i>Give me a Tab.</i>

399
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:27,398
I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

400
00:38:27,523 --> 00:38:29,483
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.

401
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:32,320
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

402
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:35,531
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay?

403
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,533
Something without sugar.

404
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:46,626
McFly.

405
00:38:49,003 --> 00:38:50,630
What are you doing?

406
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:52,673
Biff.

407
00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:55,384
I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug!

408
00:38:55,509 --> 00:38:59,430
- Biff. Guys. How are you doing?
- You got my homework finished?

409
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:02,850
Actually, I figured
since it wasn't due 'til Monday...

410
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:05,770
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

411
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:08,189
Think, McFly. Think!

412
00:39:08,272 --> 00:39:10,149
I got to have time to recopy it.

413
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:13,986
You realize what would happen if I hand in
my homework in your handwriting?

414
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,780
I'll get kicked out of school.

415
00:39:15,905 --> 00:39:18,449
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

416
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:22,328
- Would you?
- Of course not.

417
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:24,330
- No.
- I wouldn't want that to happen.

418
00:39:24,455 --> 00:39:28,376
- What are you looking at, butthead?
- Get a load of his life preserver.

419
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:30,211
Dork thinks he's going to drown.

420
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:32,171
How about my homework, McFly?

421
00:39:33,297 --> 00:39:34,924
Okay, Biff.

422
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:39,804
I'll finish that up tonight and then I'll
bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

423
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:43,558
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.
Your shoe's untied!

424
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:46,227
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

425
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:50,064
- I don't want to see you in here again.
- Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

426
00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:14,547
- What?
- You're George McFly!

427
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:16,799
Yeah. Who are you?

428
00:40:16,924 --> 00:40:19,594
Why do you let those boys
push you around like that for?

429
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:21,053
They're bigger than me.

430
00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:23,431
Stand tall. Have some respect for yourself.

431
00:40:23,598 --> 00:40:28,144
If you let people walk over you now, they'll
walk over you the rest of your life.

432
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:31,397
Look at me. You think
I'll spend my life in this slop house?

433
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,274
- Watch it, Goldie.
- No, sir!

434
00:40:33,357 --> 00:40:35,818
I'll do something.
I'll go to night school.

435
00:40:35,943 --> 00:40:38,154
One day, I'm going to be somebody.

436
00:40:38,237 --> 00:40:40,114
That's right. He's going to be mayor.

437
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:41,574
Yeah, I'm...

438
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:43,618
Mayor!

439
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:48,289
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.

440
00:40:48,372 --> 00:40:52,126
- A colored mayor. That'll be the day.
- Wait and see. I will be mayor.

441
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:54,629
I'll be the most powerful man
in Hill Valley...

442
00:40:54,712 --> 00:40:56,505
and I'm going to clean up this town.

443
00:40:56,631 --> 00:40:59,258
Good. You can start by sweeping the floor.

444
00:41:02,136 --> 00:41:04,263
Mayor Goldie Wilson.

445
00:41:04,347 --> 00:41:06,224
I like the sound of that.

446
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:22,198
Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!

447
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:55,523
He's a peeping Tom!

448
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:02,446
Dad!

449
00:42:15,084 --> 00:42:17,295
Wait a minute. Who are you?

450
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:23,384
Stella! Another one of these damn kids
jumped in front of my car!

451
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:27,054
<i>Come out here!</i>
<i>Help me take him in the house!</i>

452
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:34,061
Mom?

453
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:35,771
<i>That you?</i>

454
00:42:36,105 --> 00:42:37,607
There, there, now.

455
00:42:37,857 --> 00:42:39,275
<i>Just relax.</i>

456
00:42:41,777 --> 00:42:44,447
<i>You've been asleep</i>
<i>for almost nine hours now.</i>

457
00:42:46,657 --> 00:42:49,118
I had a horrible nightmare.

458
00:42:50,161 --> 00:42:53,247
I dreamed that I went back in time.

459
00:42:53,706 --> 00:42:55,041
<i>It was terrible.</i>

460
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:57,126
Well...

461
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:01,047
you're safe and sound now
back in good old 1955.

462
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:03,674
1955?

463
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:11,098
You're my...

464
00:43:11,307 --> 00:43:13,184
My name is Lorraine.

465
00:43:13,476 --> 00:43:16,395
- Lorraine Baines?
- Yeah.

466
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:18,981
But you're...

467
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:20,566
You're so...

468
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:23,986
You're so thin!

469
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:27,156
Just relax, Calvin.
You got a big bruise on your head.

470
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,329
Where are my pants?

471
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:35,081
Over there...

472
00:43:35,623 --> 00:43:37,250
on my hope chest.

473
00:43:38,668 --> 00:43:41,504
I've never seen
purple underwear before, Calvin.

474
00:43:41,879 --> 00:43:44,882
Calvin?
Why do you keep calling me Calvin?

475
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:47,718
That is your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein.

476
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,513
It's written all over your underwear.

477
00:43:51,472 --> 00:43:53,849
I guess they call you Cal, huh?

478
00:43:54,225 --> 00:43:56,018
No, actually, people...

479
00:43:56,727 --> 00:43:58,271
call me Marty.

480
00:44:00,022 --> 00:44:01,983
Pleased to meet you, Calvin...

481
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,735
Marty...

482
00:44:06,153 --> 00:44:07,405
Klein.

483
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:17,415
- Do you mind if I sit here?
- No. Fine.

484
00:44:17,582 --> 00:44:20,126
No. Good. Fine. Good.

485
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:24,589
That's a big bruise you have there.

486
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:28,175
Lorraine, are you up there?

487
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:30,177
Oh, my God! It's my mother!

488
00:44:30,344 --> 00:44:33,347
Quick! Put your pants back on!

489
00:44:41,606 --> 00:44:43,900
Marty, how long have you been in port?

490
00:44:44,025 --> 00:44:46,485
- Excuse me?
- I guessed you're a sailor.

491
00:44:46,569 --> 00:44:49,030
That's why you wear that life preserver.

492
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:50,531
Coast guard.

493
00:44:50,615 --> 00:44:54,994
Sam, here's the young man you hit
with your car. He's all right. Thank God.

494
00:44:55,077 --> 00:44:57,371
What were you doing
in the middle of the street?

495
00:44:57,455 --> 00:45:00,166
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

496
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:03,085
Quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.

497
00:45:03,169 --> 00:45:05,046
You already know Lorraine.

498
00:45:05,171 --> 00:45:07,214
This is Milton, this is Sally...

499
00:45:07,298 --> 00:45:11,510
that's Toby, and over there
in the playpen is little baby Joey.

500
00:45:13,512 --> 00:45:15,473
So, you're my uncle Joey.

501
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,768
Better get used to these bars, kid.

502
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:23,105
Yes. Joey just loves being in his playpen.

503
00:45:23,231 --> 00:45:26,817
He cries whenever we take him out,
so we leave him in there all the time.

504
00:45:26,943 --> 00:45:29,320
Well, Marty, I hope you like meat loaf.

505
00:45:29,612 --> 00:45:32,531
- Well, listen, I really ought to...
- Sit here, Marty.

506
00:45:33,324 --> 00:45:37,703
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing
and come in here and eat your dinner.

507
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:41,249
Look at it roll.

508
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:44,377
Now we can watch
Jackie Gleason while we eat.

509
00:45:52,468 --> 00:45:55,972
Our first television set.
Dad just picked it up today.

510
00:45:56,764 --> 00:45:58,474
Do you have a television?

511
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:01,811
Well, yeah.
You know, we have two of them.

512
00:46:01,936 --> 00:46:04,689
You must be rich.

513
00:46:04,772 --> 00:46:09,235
Honey, he's teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.

514
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:17,827
I've seen this one. This is a classic.

515
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:20,913
This is where Ralph dresses up
as a man from space.

516
00:46:21,163 --> 00:46:24,333
What do you mean, you've seen this?
It's brand-new.

517
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:27,295
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

518
00:46:27,753 --> 00:46:29,380
What's a rerun?

519
00:46:29,672 --> 00:46:31,173
You'll find out.

520
00:46:31,257 --> 00:46:33,551
You know, Marty,
you look so familiar to me.

521
00:46:33,676 --> 00:46:35,636
Do I know your mother?

522
00:46:36,846 --> 00:46:38,806
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

523
00:46:38,973 --> 00:46:42,310
Then I'll call her.
I don't want her to worry about you.

524
00:46:42,393 --> 00:46:43,561
You can't.

525
00:46:43,728 --> 00:46:48,024
That is, nobody's home.

526
00:46:50,526 --> 00:46:51,944
Yet.

527
00:46:54,071 --> 00:46:55,239
Listen.

528
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:57,909
Do you know where Riverside Drive is?

529
00:46:58,034 --> 00:47:01,954
It's on the other end of town.
A block past Maple. East end of town.

530
00:47:02,246 --> 00:47:05,583
A block past Maple.
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

531
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:09,045
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

532
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:10,630
Mother?

533
00:47:11,088 --> 00:47:13,716
<i>With Marty's parents out of town...</i>

534
00:47:14,258 --> 00:47:16,636
don't you think
he ought to spend the night?

535
00:47:16,761 --> 00:47:19,138
After all,
Dad almost killed him with the car.

536
00:47:19,263 --> 00:47:21,224
That's true, Marty.

537
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:25,102
I think you should spend the night.
I think you're our responsibility.

538
00:47:25,228 --> 00:47:28,648
- Well, gee, I don't know.
- He can sleep in my room.

539
00:47:28,981 --> 00:47:30,608
I got to go!

540
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,110
Thanks very much. You were all great.

541
00:47:33,194 --> 00:47:34,654
See you all later.

542
00:47:35,821 --> 00:47:37,323
Much later.

543
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:43,913
He's a very strange young man.

544
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,456
He's an idiot.

545
00:47:45,623 --> 00:47:48,960
<i>Comes from upbringing.</i>
<i>His parents are probably idiots, too.</i>

546
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:53,381
<i>Lorraine, you ever have a kid</i>
<i>who acts that way, I'll disown you.</i>

547
00:48:31,377 --> 00:48:32,795
Doc?

548
00:48:33,379 --> 00:48:34,964
Don't say a word.

549
00:48:36,215 --> 00:48:38,759
No names. I want
to know nothing about you.

550
00:48:38,843 --> 00:48:40,428
- Listen, Doc...
- Quiet!

551
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:42,138
Don't tell me anything.

552
00:48:42,263 --> 00:48:44,390
- You got to help...
- Quiet.

553
00:48:47,018 --> 00:48:48,978
I'm going to read your thoughts.

554
00:48:49,103 --> 00:48:52,690
Let's see now.
You come here from a great distance?

555
00:48:52,773 --> 00:48:55,234
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Don't tell me!

556
00:48:55,776 --> 00:48:58,613
You want me to subscribe
to the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>.

557
00:48:58,696 --> 00:49:01,240
- No.
- Not a word now!

558
00:49:01,365 --> 00:49:02,533
Quiet.

559
00:49:04,702 --> 00:49:06,037
Donations.

560
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,164
You want me to make a donation...

561
00:49:08,247 --> 00:49:10,625
to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

562
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,585
Doc...

563
00:49:14,128 --> 00:49:16,255
I'm from the future.

564
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:19,342
I came here in a time machine
that you invented.

565
00:49:19,842 --> 00:49:24,555
Now, I need your help
to get back to the year 1985.

566
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,391
My God!

567
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:34,232
Do you know what this means?

568
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,196
It means that
this damn thing doesn't work at all!

569
00:49:40,279 --> 00:49:44,659
You got to help me. You are the only
one who knows how your time machine works.

570
00:49:44,742 --> 00:49:46,202
Time machine?

571
00:49:46,744 --> 00:49:48,955
I haven't invented any time machine.

572
00:49:50,456 --> 00:49:52,500
Okay. I'll prove it to you.

573
00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:56,128
Look at my driver's license. Expires 1987.

574
00:49:56,254 --> 00:49:59,840
Look at my birthday.
I haven't even been born yet.

575
00:49:59,924 --> 00:50:01,968
And look at this picture.

576
00:50:02,176 --> 00:50:04,303
It's my brother, my sister and me.

577
00:50:04,428 --> 00:50:07,682
Look at her sweatshirt, Doc.
<i>"</i>Class of 1984<i>"</i>?

578
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:12,687
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.
They cut off your brother's hair.

579
00:50:13,563 --> 00:50:15,940
I'm telling the truth.
You got to believe me.

580
00:50:16,023 --> 00:50:18,859
Then tell me, future boy...

581
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:23,364
who's president of the United States
in 1985?

582
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:26,951
- Ronald Reagan.
- Ronald Reagan? The actor?

583
00:50:28,536 --> 00:50:31,080
Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?

584
00:50:32,248 --> 00:50:35,751
- I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady.
- Wait, Doc!

585
00:50:35,835 --> 00:50:38,045
And Jack Benny is treasury secretary.

586
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:39,463
Listen to me.

587
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:43,009
I've had enough jokes for one evening.
Good night, future boy!

588
00:50:43,092 --> 00:50:44,427
No, wait, Doc.

589
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:48,806
The bruise on your head.
I know how that happened. You told me.

590
00:50:48,931 --> 00:50:51,475
You were standing on your toilet
hanging a clock...

591
00:50:51,601 --> 00:50:53,811
and you fell
and hit your head on the sink.

592
00:50:53,895 --> 00:50:57,648
That's when you got the idea
for the flux capacitor which...

593
00:50:57,732 --> 00:51:00,902
is what makes time travel possible.

594
00:51:13,998 --> 00:51:18,169
There's something wrong with
the starter, so I hid it here.

595
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:30,640
After I fell off my toilet...

596
00:51:31,682 --> 00:51:33,059
<i>I drew this.</i>

597
00:51:37,021 --> 00:51:38,522
The flux capacitor.

598
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:58,125
It works!

599
00:52:00,503 --> 00:52:02,046
It works!

600
00:52:03,339 --> 00:52:05,716
I finally invent something that works!

601
00:52:06,801 --> 00:52:08,678
You bet your ass it works.

602
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:12,640
We've got to sneak this back
to my laboratory.

603
00:52:12,974 --> 00:52:14,850
We've got to get you home!

604
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,061
This is it.

605
00:52:19,188 --> 00:52:21,232
<i>Never mind that now.</i>

606
00:52:21,315 --> 00:52:23,693
Why, that's me! Look at me!

607
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:26,028
- I'm an old man!
<i>- I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.</i>

608
00:52:26,112 --> 00:52:28,155
<i>I'm in the Twin Pines Mall parking lot.</i>

609
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:30,283
Thank God, I've still got my hair.

610
00:52:30,408 --> 00:52:32,368
What's this thing I'm wearing?

611
00:52:32,493 --> 00:52:34,620
This is a radiation suit.

612
00:52:34,745 --> 00:52:36,455
Radiation suit?

613
00:52:36,581 --> 00:52:39,917
Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout
from the atomic wars.

614
00:52:40,918 --> 00:52:43,921
This is truly amazing.

615
00:52:44,088 --> 00:52:46,632
A portable television studio.

616
00:52:46,966 --> 00:52:50,803
No wonder your president has to be
an actor. He has to look good on TV.

617
00:52:50,887 --> 00:52:52,763
This is the part coming up.

618
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:58,311
<i>This sucker's electrical but I need a nuclear
reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...</i>

619
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:00,396
What did I just say?

620
00:53:03,774 --> 00:53:06,861
<i>This sucker's electrical,</i>
<i>but I need a nuclear reaction...</i>

621
00:53:06,986 --> 00:53:10,907
<i>- To generate the 1.21 gigawatts of...</i>
- 1.21 gigawatts!

622
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:14,452
1.21 gigawatts.

623
00:53:16,579 --> 00:53:18,164
Great Scott!

624
00:53:20,374 --> 00:53:22,919
What the hell is a gigawatt?

625
00:53:23,586 --> 00:53:25,713
How could I have been so careless?

626
00:53:25,796 --> 00:53:27,673
1.21 gigawatts!

627
00:53:27,757 --> 00:53:30,426
Tom, how am I going to generate
that kind of power?

628
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:32,053
It can't be done, can it?

629
00:53:32,136 --> 00:53:35,556
Doc, look.
All we need is a little plutonium.

630
00:53:36,182 --> 00:53:40,228
I'm sure that in 1985 plutonium is
available in every corner drugstore...

631
00:53:40,311 --> 00:53:43,064
but in 1955, it's a
little hard to come by.

632
00:53:43,147 --> 00:53:46,150
Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

633
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:49,862
Doc, stuck here? I can't be stuck here.

634
00:53:49,987 --> 00:53:52,198
I got a life in 1985.

635
00:53:52,323 --> 00:53:54,367
- I got a girl.
- Is she pretty?

636
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:56,619
Doc, she's beautiful.

637
00:53:57,495 --> 00:53:59,622
She's crazy about me. Look at this.

638
00:53:59,997 --> 00:54:01,874
<i>Look what she wrote here.</i>

639
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:03,876
<i>That says it all.</i>

640
00:54:04,669 --> 00:54:07,338
Doc, you're my only hope.

641
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,217
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source
capable of generating...

642
00:54:11,342 --> 00:54:14,512
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

643
00:54:15,972 --> 00:54:18,266
- What did you say?
- A bolt of lightning.

644
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:22,144
Unfortunately, you never know
when or where it's ever going to strike.

645
00:54:24,146 --> 00:54:25,314
We do now.

646
00:54:30,611 --> 00:54:31,779
This is it!

647
00:54:32,488 --> 00:54:34,699
This is the answer.

648
00:54:34,949 --> 00:54:37,326
It says here that a bolt of lightning...

649
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:41,706
is going to strike the clock tower
at 10:04 p.m. Next Saturday night!

650
00:54:45,334 --> 00:54:48,754
If we could somehow harness
this lightning...

651
00:54:49,964 --> 00:54:53,301
channel it into the flux capacitor...

652
00:54:54,594 --> 00:54:56,095
<i>it just might work.</i>

653
00:54:56,679 --> 00:55:00,808
Next Saturday night
we're sending you back to the future!

654
00:55:01,767 --> 00:55:03,644
All right. Saturday's good.

655
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:07,565
I can spend a week in 1955.
I can hang out. You can show me around.

656
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:10,735
That is out of the question.
You must not leave this house.

657
00:55:10,818 --> 00:55:12,778
You must not see or talk to anybody.

658
00:55:12,904 --> 00:55:17,199
Anything you do can have repercussions
on future events. Do you understand?

659
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,077
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

660
00:55:20,786 --> 00:55:22,204
Marty...

661
00:55:22,413 --> 00:55:25,583
have you interacted with anybody else
today besides me?

662
00:55:27,627 --> 00:55:30,796
Yeah, well, I might've sort of
bumped into my parents.

663
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,383
Great Scott! Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

664
00:55:38,179 --> 00:55:41,766
Just as I thought. This proves my theory.
Look at your brother.

665
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:46,020
His head's gone. It's
like it's been erased.

666
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,774
Erased from existence.

667
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:58,157
They really cleaned this place up.
Looks brand-new.

668
00:55:58,241 --> 00:56:01,661
According to my theory, you interfered
with your parents' first meeting.

669
00:56:01,786 --> 00:56:05,039
If they don't meet, they won't fall
in love, get married or have kids.

670
00:56:05,164 --> 00:56:07,458
That's why your brother's disappearing.

671
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:11,087
Your sister will follow, and unless
you repair the damage, you're next.

672
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:14,131
- Sounds heavy.
- Weight has nothing to do with it.

673
00:56:14,215 --> 00:56:15,758
Which one's your pop?

674
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,427
That's him.

675
00:56:19,053 --> 00:56:21,264
Okay. Okay, you guys.

676
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,310
Very funny.
You guys are being real mature.

677
00:56:26,477 --> 00:56:28,271
Maybe you were adopted.

678
00:56:28,396 --> 00:56:30,940
Okay, real mature, guys.

679
00:56:31,857 --> 00:56:34,402
- Okay, pick up my books.
- McFly.

680
00:56:34,485 --> 00:56:35,945
That's Strickland.

681
00:56:36,654 --> 00:56:38,698
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

682
00:56:38,823 --> 00:56:41,367
Shape up, man. You're a slacker.

683
00:56:41,617 --> 00:56:44,620
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

684
00:56:44,787 --> 00:56:45,705
No.

685
00:56:46,205 --> 00:56:49,041
- What did your mother see in him?
- I don't know.

686
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:52,962
I guess she felt sorry for him
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

687
00:56:53,629 --> 00:56:55,840
He hit me with the car.

688
00:56:55,965 --> 00:56:57,925
That's the Florence Nightingale effect.

689
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:01,554
It happens in hospitals when
nurses fall in love with their patients.

690
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:02,930
Go to it, kid.

691
00:57:04,432 --> 00:57:06,559
George, buddy.

692
00:57:06,976 --> 00:57:09,353
I have been looking all over for you.

693
00:57:09,437 --> 00:57:12,773
You remember me,
the guy who saved your life the other day?

694
00:57:13,649 --> 00:57:16,736
- Yeah.
- There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

695
00:57:21,198 --> 00:57:22,366
Lorraine?

696
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:24,410
Calvin!

697
00:57:25,411 --> 00:57:28,164
I'd like you to meet
my good friend George McFly.

698
00:57:28,247 --> 00:57:31,500
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.

699
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,254
- How's your head?
- Good. Fine.

700
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:39,050
I've been worried about you
ever since you ran off the other night.

701
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:40,468
Are you okay?

702
00:57:41,886 --> 00:57:44,347
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Come on!

703
00:57:45,264 --> 00:57:47,058
Isn't he a dreamboat?

704
00:57:51,229 --> 00:57:54,482
- She didn't even look at him.
- This is more serious than I thought.

705
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:57,693
Your mother is infatuated with you
instead of your father.

706
00:57:58,819 --> 00:57:59,987
Wait a minute, Doc.

707
00:58:00,071 --> 00:58:03,658
Are you trying to tell me
that my mother has got the hots for me?

708
00:58:03,783 --> 00:58:06,410
- Precisely.
- This is heavy.

709
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:08,663
There's that word again. <i>"</i>Heavy.<i>"</i>

710
00:58:08,788 --> 00:58:13,000
Why are things so heavy in the future? Is
there a problem with the Earth's gravity?

711
00:58:13,084 --> 00:58:16,420
The only way we're going to
get them to mate is if they're alone.

712
00:58:16,504 --> 00:58:18,881
You've got to get them to interact...

713
00:58:19,215 --> 00:58:21,259
in some sort of social...

714
00:58:22,635 --> 00:58:24,929
- You mean like a date?
- Right!

715
00:58:25,513 --> 00:58:28,224
What kind of date?
What do kids do in the '50s?

716
00:58:28,849 --> 00:58:30,977
They're your parents.
You must know them.

717
00:58:31,102 --> 00:58:34,855
What are their common interests?
What do they like to do together?

718
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:36,315
Nothing.

719
00:58:36,399 --> 00:58:39,485
Look! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

720
00:58:39,694 --> 00:58:43,114
The Enchantment Under the Sea dance!
They're supposed to go to this.

721
00:58:43,197 --> 00:58:46,200
- That's where they kiss for the first time.
- All right, kid.

722
00:58:46,325 --> 00:58:50,079
You stick to your father like glue
and make sure he takes her to that dance.

723
00:58:50,454 --> 00:58:52,331
George, buddy...

724
00:58:52,748 --> 00:58:56,002
remember that girl
I introduced you to, Lorraine?

725
00:59:02,049 --> 00:59:03,759
What are you writing?

726
00:59:04,927 --> 00:59:06,178
Stories.

727
00:59:06,637 --> 00:59:10,308
Science fiction stories
about visitors...

728
00:59:10,641 --> 00:59:13,811
coming down to Earth
from other planets.

729
00:59:15,897 --> 00:59:19,567
Get out of town!
I didn't know you did anything creative.

730
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:22,862
- Let me read some.
- No, no.

731
00:59:22,945 --> 00:59:25,865
I never let anybody read my stories.

732
00:59:26,532 --> 00:59:27,909
Why not?

733
00:59:29,076 --> 00:59:32,830
What if they didn't like them?
What if they told me I was no good?

734
00:59:34,749 --> 00:59:38,252
I guess that would be pretty hard
for somebody to understand.

735
00:59:38,961 --> 00:59:41,505
No. No, not hard at all.

736
00:59:42,757 --> 00:59:45,301
So anyway, George. About Lorraine.

737
00:59:46,469 --> 00:59:48,054
She really likes you.

738
00:59:49,263 --> 00:59:52,016
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her...

739
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:54,060
to the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

740
00:59:54,143 --> 00:59:55,144
- Really?
- Yeah.

741
00:59:55,394 --> 00:59:58,231
All you got to do is go over there
and ask her.

742
00:59:59,398 --> 01:00:01,609
Right here, right now, in the cafeteria?

743
01:00:01,692 --> 01:00:05,363
What if she said no? I don't know
if I could take that kind of rejection.

744
01:00:07,073 --> 01:00:10,993
Besides, I think she'd rather go
with somebody else.

745
01:00:12,328 --> 01:00:13,496
Who?

746
01:00:15,414 --> 01:00:16,415
Biff.

747
01:00:17,959 --> 01:00:20,419
- Don't kid around. Come on.
- Come on. Leave.

748
01:00:20,544 --> 01:00:22,505
You know you want it.

749
01:00:22,588 --> 01:00:24,548
You know you want me to give it to you.

750
01:00:24,674 --> 01:00:27,593
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

751
01:00:28,511 --> 01:00:31,180
Maybe you are
and you just don't know it yet.

752
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:33,140
Get your meat hooks off of me.

753
01:00:33,266 --> 01:00:36,185
You heard her.
She said, get your meat hooks...

754
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:37,895
off.

755
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:40,398
Please.

756
01:00:41,274 --> 01:00:43,067
What's it to you, butthead?

757
01:00:44,485 --> 01:00:46,529
You been looking for a fight.

758
01:00:56,664 --> 01:00:59,750
Since you're new here,
I'm going to cut you a break...

759
01:01:00,251 --> 01:01:01,335
today.

760
01:01:02,545 --> 01:01:05,006
So why don't you make like a tree...

761
01:01:05,214 --> 01:01:06,841
and get out of here.

762
01:01:18,978 --> 01:01:19,562
George!

763
01:01:21,647 --> 01:01:23,608
Why do you keep following me?

764
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:28,487
George, I'm telling you,
if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance...

765
01:01:28,571 --> 01:01:31,574
- I'll regret it for the rest of my life.
- I can't go.

766
01:01:31,699 --> 01:01:34,869
I'll miss my favorite TV program,
<i>Science Fiction Theatre</i>.

767
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:38,289
Yeah, but Lorraine wants to go with you.

768
01:01:38,497 --> 01:01:40,041
Give her a break.

769
01:01:40,374 --> 01:01:43,878
I'm just not ready
to ask Lorraine out to the dance...

770
01:01:44,545 --> 01:01:47,548
and not you
or anybody else on this planet...

771
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,051
is going to make me change my mind.

772
01:01:57,225 --> 01:01:59,101
<i>Science Fiction Theatre</i>.

773
01:02:30,841 --> 01:02:32,009
Who are you?

774
01:02:37,431 --> 01:02:39,475
<i>Silence, Earthling.</i>

775
01:02:40,935 --> 01:02:43,396
<i>My name is Darth Vader.</i>

776
01:02:48,442 --> 01:02:51,862
<i>I am an extraterrestrial</i>
<i>from the planet Vulcan.</i>

777
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:55,032
Marty!

778
01:02:58,327 --> 01:03:00,538
- Marty! Marty!
- George, buddy.

779
01:03:00,621 --> 01:03:02,999
You weren't at school.
What have you been doing?

780
01:03:03,124 --> 01:03:06,043
I overslept. I need your help.

781
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:09,130
I have to ask Lorraine out,
but I don't know how to do it.

782
01:03:09,213 --> 01:03:11,674
Keep your pants on. She's over in the cafe.

783
01:03:11,757 --> 01:03:13,801
God! How do you...?

784
01:03:16,637 --> 01:03:18,347
What made you change your mind?

785
01:03:18,431 --> 01:03:21,350
Last night, Darth Vader came down
from planet Vulcan...

786
01:03:21,434 --> 01:03:25,354
and told me that if I didn't
take Lorraine out, he'd melt my brain.

787
01:03:25,438 --> 01:03:28,524
Let's just keep this brain-melting stuff
to ourselves, okay?

788
01:03:28,608 --> 01:03:31,861
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right. There she is.

789
01:03:32,194 --> 01:03:33,988
Just go in there and invite her.

790
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:36,782
- But I don't know what to say.
- Say anything.

791
01:03:36,866 --> 01:03:40,369
Say whatever's natural,
the first thing that comes into your mind.

792
01:03:41,537 --> 01:03:43,414
Nothing's coming to my mind.

793
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:45,666
Jesus. It's a wonder I was even born.

794
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:48,336
- What? What?
- Nothing.

795
01:03:49,837 --> 01:03:52,548
Tell her destiny brought you together.

796
01:03:52,632 --> 01:03:56,469
Tell her she is the most beautiful girl
you have ever seen in the world.

797
01:03:56,594 --> 01:03:58,221
Girls like that stuff.

798
01:03:58,888 --> 01:04:02,058
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing this down. This is good stuff.

799
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:05,269
- Yeah. Okay. Can you take care of that?
- Right.

800
01:04:23,412 --> 01:04:26,165
Lou, give me a milk.

801
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:28,793
Chocolate.

802
01:04:45,268 --> 01:04:46,519
Lorraine.

803
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,437
My density...

804
01:04:49,105 --> 01:04:50,982
has popped me to you.

805
01:04:51,732 --> 01:04:52,900
What?

806
01:04:55,027 --> 01:04:57,697
What I meant to say was...

807
01:04:57,822 --> 01:05:00,575
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

808
01:05:01,284 --> 01:05:02,368
Yes.

809
01:05:02,702 --> 01:05:06,622
Yes. I'm George. George McFly.

810
01:05:07,248 --> 01:05:08,874
I'm your density.

811
01:05:09,917 --> 01:05:11,168
I mean...

812
01:05:12,628 --> 01:05:13,879
your destiny.

813
01:05:17,383 --> 01:05:18,301
McFly.

814
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:25,516
I thought I told you never to come in here.

815
01:05:28,352 --> 01:05:30,146
Well, it's going to cost you.

816
01:05:30,897 --> 01:05:32,857
How much money you got on you?

817
01:05:33,482 --> 01:05:35,276
How much do you want, Biff?

818
01:05:43,868 --> 01:05:45,286
All right, punk.

819
01:05:45,494 --> 01:05:47,872
- Now I'm going to...
- Biff. What's that?

820
01:05:54,962 --> 01:05:58,049
That's Calvin Klein. My God, he's a dream.

821
01:05:58,925 --> 01:06:01,677
Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!

822
01:06:04,513 --> 01:06:06,224
I'll get it back to you.

823
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:08,351
You broke it!

824
01:06:08,684 --> 01:06:10,561
Come back here!

825
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:14,023
Look at him go!

826
01:06:15,608 --> 01:06:16,609
Get him!

827
01:06:30,248 --> 01:06:32,375
To the car! Go!

828
01:06:38,673 --> 01:06:41,509
- What's that thing he's on?
- A board with wheels.

829
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:43,135
He's an absolute dream.

830
01:06:43,219 --> 01:06:46,055
- Come on, come on!
- Look out for the car!

831
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,840
I'm going to ram him.

832
01:07:28,681 --> 01:07:29,682
Shit!

833
01:07:54,999 --> 01:07:56,417
Thanks a lot, kid.

834
01:07:57,835 --> 01:07:59,962
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

835
01:08:00,338 --> 01:08:03,424
- Where does he come from?
- Yeah, where does he live?

836
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,426
I don't know...

837
01:08:05,968 --> 01:08:07,929
but I'm going to find out.

838
01:08:13,476 --> 01:08:14,477
<i>My God.</i>

839
01:08:15,228 --> 01:08:18,189
<i>They found me.</i>
<i>I don't know how, but they found me.</i>

840
01:08:18,397 --> 01:08:19,941
<i>Run for it, Marty!</i>

841
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:25,780
<i>My God.</i>

842
01:08:26,948 --> 01:08:29,784
<i>They found me.</i>
<i>I don't know how, but they found me.</i>

843
01:08:29,951 --> 01:08:31,327
<i>Run for it, Marty!</i>

844
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:33,537
Doc?

845
01:08:34,455 --> 01:08:37,416
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.

846
01:08:38,376 --> 01:08:40,920
Fascinating device, this video unit.

847
01:08:41,921 --> 01:08:43,547
Listen, Doc.

848
01:08:43,673 --> 01:08:48,469
- I haven't told you about...
- One shouldn't know about his own destiny.

849
01:08:48,553 --> 01:08:50,137
- You don't understand.
- I do.

850
01:08:50,221 --> 01:08:52,765
If I know too much
I endanger my own existence...

851
01:08:52,848 --> 01:08:55,226
just as you've endangered yours.

852
01:08:57,311 --> 01:08:59,188
You're right.

853
01:08:59,313 --> 01:09:02,191
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

854
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:04,151
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

855
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:06,821
I didn't have time to build it to scale
or paint it.

856
01:09:06,904 --> 01:09:09,031
- It's good.
- Thank you.

857
01:09:10,866 --> 01:09:15,162
We run industrial-strength electrical cable
from the top of the clock tower...

858
01:09:15,246 --> 01:09:18,749
<i>down, suspending it over the street</i>
<i>between these two lampposts.</i>

859
01:09:19,166 --> 01:09:23,170
Meanwhile, we've outfitted the time
vehicle with this big pole and hook...

860
01:09:23,254 --> 01:09:26,340
which runs directly
into the flux capacitor.

861
01:09:27,258 --> 01:09:29,051
At the calculated moment...

862
01:09:29,677 --> 01:09:31,804
you start off from down the street...

863
01:09:31,929 --> 01:09:35,975
<i>driving directly toward the cable,</i>
<i>accelerating to 88 miles per hour.</i>

864
01:09:36,225 --> 01:09:39,812
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 p.m. This Saturday night...

865
01:09:39,937 --> 01:09:43,524
lightning will strike the clock tower,
electrifying the cable...

866
01:09:43,649 --> 01:09:45,860
<i>as the connecting hook makes contact...</i>

867
01:09:45,985 --> 01:09:49,572
<i>thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts</i>
<i>into the flux capacitor...</i>

868
01:09:49,989 --> 01:09:52,033
and sending you back to 1985.

869
01:09:52,241 --> 01:09:55,828
All right, now. Watch this.
You wind up the car and release it.

870
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,041
I'll simulate the lightning.

871
01:10:08,591 --> 01:10:09,508
Ready.

872
01:10:19,518 --> 01:10:20,603
Set.

873
01:10:25,691 --> 01:10:26,692
Release.

874
01:10:45,211 --> 01:10:47,588
You're instilling me
with a lot of confidence.

875
01:10:47,672 --> 01:10:51,342
Don't worry. I'll take care of ideas.
You take care of your pop.

876
01:10:52,552 --> 01:10:53,553
By the way...

877
01:10:53,678 --> 01:10:55,888
what happened today? Did he ask her out?

878
01:10:55,972 --> 01:10:58,015
- I think so.
- What did she say?

879
01:11:06,649 --> 01:11:10,945
It's your mom! She's tracked you down!
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.

880
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:26,711
Hi, Cal... Marty.

881
01:11:27,837 --> 01:11:28,921
Lorraine.

882
01:11:30,172 --> 01:11:32,049
How did you know I was here?

883
01:11:33,301 --> 01:11:34,552
I followed you.

884
01:11:36,304 --> 01:11:38,431
This is my doc... My uncle...

885
01:11:39,265 --> 01:11:41,225
Doc Brown.

886
01:11:42,184 --> 01:11:43,436
- Hi.
- Hi.

887
01:11:46,522 --> 01:11:49,859
Marty, this may seem a little forward...

888
01:11:50,067 --> 01:11:52,278
but I was kind of wondering...

889
01:11:52,987 --> 01:11:55,114
if you'd ask me to the...

890
01:11:55,907 --> 01:11:58,910
Enchantment Under the Sea dance
on Saturday?

891
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:02,038
You mean...

892
01:12:02,455 --> 01:12:04,332
You mean nobody's asked you?

893
01:12:04,749 --> 01:12:05,666
No.

894
01:12:06,834 --> 01:12:08,169
Not yet.

895
01:12:09,545 --> 01:12:12,882
- What about George?
- George McFly?

896
01:12:15,509 --> 01:12:19,513
He's kind of cute and all, but not...

897
01:12:20,389 --> 01:12:21,390
Well...

898
01:12:22,266 --> 01:12:24,477
I think a man should be strong...

899
01:12:26,437 --> 01:12:28,648
so he can stand up for himself...

900
01:12:29,732 --> 01:12:32,109
and protect the woman he loves.

901
01:12:36,697 --> 01:12:37,782
Don't you?

902
01:12:39,575 --> 01:12:40,409
Yeah.

903
01:12:41,494 --> 01:12:43,371
I still don't understand.

904
01:12:43,579 --> 01:12:46,290
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her...

905
01:12:46,374 --> 01:12:49,126
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

906
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:51,879
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

907
01:12:51,963 --> 01:12:53,839
She just doesn't know it yet.

908
01:12:53,965 --> 01:12:56,968
That's why we got to show her
that you, George, are a fighter.

909
01:12:57,093 --> 01:13:00,513
You're somebody who stands up
for yourself and will protect her.

910
01:13:00,638 --> 01:13:03,724
Yeah, but I've never picked a fight
in my entire life.

911
01:13:03,933 --> 01:13:06,686
Look, you're not going
to be picking a fight, Dad...

912
01:13:06,769 --> 01:13:08,479
Dad-dad-daddy-o.

913
01:13:09,063 --> 01:13:11,274
You're coming to her rescue, right?

914
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,443
Let's go over the plan again.
8:55, where are you going to be?

915
01:13:14,527 --> 01:13:16,112
I'm going to be at the dance.

916
01:13:16,195 --> 01:13:19,282
- And where am I going to be?
- You'll be in the car, with her.

917
01:13:19,407 --> 01:13:22,368
Right around 9:00,
she's going to get very angry with me.

918
01:13:22,451 --> 01:13:24,829
Why is she going to get angry with you?

919
01:13:24,954 --> 01:13:29,500
Well, because, George, nice girls get angry
when guys take advantage of them.

920
01:13:31,877 --> 01:13:36,424
- You're going to go touch her on her...
- No. No, George, look.

921
01:13:37,258 --> 01:13:39,218
It's just an act, right?

922
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:43,264
So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

923
01:13:43,431 --> 01:13:46,851
You see us struggling in the car.

924
01:13:47,059 --> 01:13:50,229
You walk up, you open the door,
and you say...

925
01:13:51,856 --> 01:13:53,441
Your line, George.

926
01:13:56,736 --> 01:13:59,572
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

927
01:14:01,908 --> 01:14:04,285
- You really think I ought to swear?
- Definitely.

928
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,037
Goddamn it, George, swear.

929
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,040
Okay. So now you come up.
You punch me in the stomach.

930
01:14:09,123 --> 01:14:11,000
I'm out for the count, right?

931
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:14,378
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

932
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:16,714
You make it sound so easy.

933
01:14:16,839 --> 01:14:19,634
I just... I wish I wasn't so scared.

934
01:14:19,717 --> 01:14:23,304
There's nothing to be scared of.
All it takes is self-confidence.

935
01:14:23,387 --> 01:14:25,765
You know, if you put your mind to it...

936
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,184
you can accomplish anything.

937
01:14:29,894 --> 01:14:32,438
<i>Hill Valley weather this Saturday night.</i>

938
01:14:32,563 --> 01:14:35,399
<i>Mostly clear, with some scattered clouds.</i>

939
01:14:35,483 --> 01:14:37,360
<i>Lows tonight, in the upper forties.</i>

940
01:14:37,443 --> 01:14:40,112
Are you sure about this storm?

941
01:14:40,196 --> 01:14:44,492
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

942
01:14:44,575 --> 01:14:47,286
You know, Marty,
I'm going to be very sad to see you go.

943
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:51,040
You've made a difference in my life,
given me something to shoot for.

944
01:14:51,123 --> 01:14:55,294
Just knowing
that I'm going to be around to see 1985.

945
01:14:55,378 --> 01:14:57,255
That I'm going to succeed in this!

946
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:00,383
That I'm going to have a chance
to travel through time!

947
01:15:06,389 --> 01:15:09,058
It's going to be hard
waiting 30 years to talk to you...

948
01:15:09,141 --> 01:15:12,103
about everything that's happened
in the past few days.

949
01:15:12,186 --> 01:15:14,564
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

950
01:15:16,107 --> 01:15:17,608
I'm going to miss you.

951
01:15:22,321 --> 01:15:25,241
- Doc, about the future...
- No!

952
01:15:25,324 --> 01:15:30,538
We've agreed that information about
the future can be extremely dangerous.

953
01:15:30,663 --> 01:15:34,584
Even if your intentions are good,
it can backfire drastically.

954
01:15:35,459 --> 01:15:39,839
Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find
out through the natural course of time.

955
01:15:40,881 --> 01:15:42,842
<i>"</i>Dear Dr. Brown:

956
01:15:43,593 --> 01:15:46,429

957
01:15:46,512 --> 01:15:48,723

<i>"</i>... Marty.<i>"</i>

962
01:16:12,121 --> 01:16:15,041
'Evening, Dr. Brown. What's with the wire?

963
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:18,085
Just a little weather experiment.

964
01:16:19,587 --> 01:16:21,964
- What you got under here?
- No! Don't touch that!

965
01:16:22,089 --> 01:16:24,884
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

966
01:16:24,967 --> 01:16:27,178
Got a permit for that?

967
01:16:27,553 --> 01:16:29,180
Of course I do.

968
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:38,856
Just a second.
Let me see if I can find it here.

969
01:17:31,284 --> 01:17:33,494
Do you mind if we...

970
01:17:33,578 --> 01:17:36,122
park for a while?

971
01:17:37,081 --> 01:17:40,167
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

972
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:44,964
I'm almost 18 years old.
It's not like I've never parked before.

973
01:17:45,756 --> 01:17:47,258
What?

974
01:17:47,592 --> 01:17:50,553
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?

975
01:17:50,678 --> 01:17:51,762
No.

976
01:17:52,847 --> 01:17:53,931
No.

977
01:17:58,603 --> 01:18:00,980
Lorraine, what are you doing?

978
01:18:01,606 --> 01:18:03,900
I swiped it from
the old lady's liquor cabinet.

979
01:18:04,025 --> 01:18:06,819
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.

980
01:18:07,028 --> 01:18:08,905
- Why not?
- Because you...

981
01:18:09,655 --> 01:18:13,242
You might regret it later in life.

982
01:18:13,326 --> 01:18:15,369
Marty, don't be such a square.

983
01:18:15,494 --> 01:18:18,247
<i>Everybody who's anybody drinks.</i>

984
01:18:22,752 --> 01:18:24,545
Jeez, you smoke too?

985
01:18:25,963 --> 01:18:28,883
You're beginning to sound
just like my mother.

986
01:18:40,186 --> 01:18:43,773
<i>We're going to take a little break,</i>
<i>but we'll be back in a while...</i>

987
01:18:43,856 --> 01:18:46,525
<i>so don't nobody go nowhere.</i>

988
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:05,461
Marty? Why are you so nervous?

989
01:19:06,754 --> 01:19:08,005
Lorraine...

990
01:19:09,048 --> 01:19:10,925
have you ever...

991
01:19:12,009 --> 01:19:15,930
been in a situation where you knew
you had to act a certain way, but when...

992
01:19:16,013 --> 01:19:19,183
you got there, you didn't know
if you could go through with it?

993
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:22,353
You mean like how
you're supposed to act on a first date?

994
01:19:22,812 --> 01:19:24,397
Sort of.

995
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,733
I think I know exactly what you mean.

996
01:19:28,359 --> 01:19:29,610
You do?

997
01:19:30,152 --> 01:19:32,780
You know what I do in those situations?

998
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:35,157
- What?
- I don't worry.

999
01:19:52,967 --> 01:19:54,844
This is all wrong.

1000
01:19:54,969 --> 01:19:57,263
I don't know what it is...

1001
01:19:58,431 --> 01:20:02,101
but when I kiss you,
it's like I'm kissing...

1002
01:20:03,686 --> 01:20:05,062
my brother.

1003
01:20:05,354 --> 01:20:08,065
<i>I guess that doesn't make any sense,</i>
<i>does it?</i>

1004
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:09,775
Believe me...

1005
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:12,320
it makes perfect sense.

1006
01:20:13,696 --> 01:20:14,614
Somebody's coming.

1007
01:20:19,535 --> 01:20:23,664
You caused $300 damage to my car,
you son of a bitch...

1008
01:20:23,915 --> 01:20:26,208
and I'm going to take
it out of your ass.

1009
01:20:26,334 --> 01:20:27,877
Hold him.

1010
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,713
Let him go, Biff. You're drunk.

1011
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:33,591
Well, lookee what we have here.

1012
01:20:36,636 --> 01:20:40,223
No! Stay right here with me.
Come on, Lorraine.

1013
01:20:40,348 --> 01:20:42,558
- Let me go!
- Leave her alone!

1014
01:20:42,642 --> 01:20:44,602
Take him in back. I'll be right there.

1015
01:20:44,727 --> 01:20:47,730
<i>Just admit that you want it. Come on.</i>

1016
01:20:47,897 --> 01:20:50,441
Well, go on. This ain't no peep show.

1017
01:20:56,948 --> 01:20:59,242
- Hey, let's put him in there.
- Yeah!

1018
01:21:00,952 --> 01:21:03,246
That's for messing up my hair.

1019
01:21:03,371 --> 01:21:05,414
What the hell are you doing to my car?

1020
01:21:05,539 --> 01:21:08,459
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

1021
01:21:10,586 --> 01:21:13,589
Who you calling spook, peckerwood?

1022
01:21:14,632 --> 01:21:16,175
Listen, guys...

1023
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:18,970
I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, okay?

1024
01:21:19,053 --> 01:21:20,846
Get home to your mama, boy.

1025
01:21:20,972 --> 01:21:23,182
- Biff!
- Hurry, Biff!

1026
01:21:23,766 --> 01:21:25,726
Let me out of here!

1027
01:21:27,395 --> 01:21:29,021
Reginald, where are your keys?

1028
01:21:29,105 --> 01:21:31,315
The keys are in the trunk.

1029
01:21:31,607 --> 01:21:34,610
- Say that again?
- I said, the keys are in here.

1030
01:21:39,448 --> 01:21:41,075
Let me go!

1031
01:21:48,374 --> 01:21:49,458
Come on!

1032
01:21:51,752 --> 01:21:55,256
Hey you, get your damn hands off...

1033
01:21:57,717 --> 01:21:59,927
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

1034
01:22:01,637 --> 01:22:03,681
George, help me! Please!

1035
01:22:03,764 --> 01:22:07,351
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away.

1036
01:22:07,685 --> 01:22:09,812
- Please, George.
- Are you deaf?

1037
01:22:09,937 --> 01:22:11,981
Close the door and beat it.

1038
01:22:14,609 --> 01:22:18,279
No, Biff. You leave her alone.

1039
01:22:18,946 --> 01:22:20,740
All right, McFly.

1040
01:22:23,993 --> 01:22:25,953
You're asking for it...

1041
01:22:26,162 --> 01:22:28,205
and now you're going to get it.

1042
01:22:29,457 --> 01:22:30,708
Stop it!

1043
01:22:31,542 --> 01:22:33,419
Biff, you'll break his arm!

1044
01:22:35,296 --> 01:22:37,173
Biff, no!

1045
01:22:37,381 --> 01:22:39,258
Give me a hand here, Reginald.

1046
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:43,221
Damn it, man! I sliced my hand!

1047
01:22:43,304 --> 01:22:44,847
- Whose are these?
- Mine.

1048
01:22:44,931 --> 01:22:46,807
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1049
01:22:48,184 --> 01:22:50,478
You're going to break his arm!

1050
01:22:50,728 --> 01:22:53,981
Biff! Biff, leave him alone!

1051
01:22:54,065 --> 01:22:56,525
Let him go! Let him go!

1052
01:23:29,475 --> 01:23:31,352
Are you okay?

1053
01:23:51,205 --> 01:23:53,165
Who is that guy?

1054
01:23:53,499 --> 01:23:55,376
That's George McFly.

1055
01:23:58,671 --> 01:24:00,464
That's George McFly?

1056
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:02,049
Excuse me.

1057
01:24:13,352 --> 01:24:14,854
The storm.

1058
01:24:16,814 --> 01:24:19,525
Guys, you got to get back in there
and finish the dance.

1059
01:24:19,609 --> 01:24:21,027
Look at Marvin's hand.

1060
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:24,363
He can't play with this hand,
and we can't play without him.

1061
01:24:24,488 --> 01:24:25,948
Marvin, you got to play.

1062
01:24:26,073 --> 01:24:29,994
They kiss for the first time at the dance.
If there's no music, they can't dance.

1063
01:24:30,077 --> 01:24:33,831
If they can't dance and kiss, then they
can't fall in love and I'm history.

1064
01:24:33,956 --> 01:24:37,877
The dance is over unless you know
somebody that can play the guitar.

I don't know.

01:25:06,822 --> 01:25:09,283

No. I got to go.

1090
01:26:47,131 --> 01:26:50,218
Come on, man.
Let's do something that really cooks.

1091
01:26:50,718 --> 01:26:53,804
Something that cooks.

1092
01:26:58,893 --> 01:27:01,020
- All right.

01:27:05,024 --> 01:27:06,400

1096
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,414
All right, listen, this
is a blues riff in B.

Marty, that was very interesting music.

Yeah.

asked if he could take me home.

Great! Good. Good, Lorraine.
I had a feeling about you two.

1126
01:30:17,383 --> 01:30:18,968
I have a feeling, too.

1127

Listen, I got to go, but...

1128
01:30:21,721 --> 01:30:25,933
I wanted to tell you that
it's been educational.

1129
01:30:26,976 --> 01:30:29,186
Marty, will we ever see you again?

1130
01:30:30,646 --> 01:30:31,814
I guarantee it.

1131
01:30:31,939 --> 01:30:35,276
Well, Marty, I want to thank you
for all your good advice.

1132
01:30:35,401 --> 01:30:37,862

1138
01:30:55,421 --> 01:30:58,424
accidentally sets fire

1139
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,385
go easy on him.

1140
01:31:02,386 --> 01:31:03,638
Okay.

1141
01:31:08,559 --> 01:31:11,812

01:31:22,698 --> 01:31:23,950

1144
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:27,828
Damn! Damn!

1145
01:31:35,628 --> 01:31:38,506
You're late!
Do you have no concept of time?

1146
01:31:38,589 --> 01:31:40,967
Hey, come on. I had to change.

1147
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:43,928
Do you think I'm going back
in that zoot suit?

1148
01:31:44,053 --> 01:31:46,681
The old man really came through.
It worked.

1149
01:31:46,806 --> 01:31:48,849
He laid out Biff in one punch.

1150
01:31:48,975 --> 01:31:53,020
I didn't know he had it in him.
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.

1151
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:58,150
- Never?
- No. Why? What's the matter?

1152
01:31:58,818 --> 01:32:00,069
All right!

1153
01:32:00,361 --> 01:32:02,488
Let's set your destination time.

1154
01:32:07,285 --> 01:32:09,579
This is the exact time you left.

1155
01:32:10,037 --> 01:32:13,457
<i>Let's send you back at exactly</i>
<i>the same time.</i>

1156
01:32:16,377 --> 01:32:18,421
It'll be like you never left.

1157
01:32:20,298 --> 01:32:24,594
Now, I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

1158
01:32:24,802 --> 01:32:26,679
That's where you'll start from.

1159
01:32:26,762 --> 01:32:29,056
I've calculated the precise distance...

1160
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:31,851
taking into account
the acceleration speed...

1161
01:32:31,934 --> 01:32:36,188
and wind resistance retroactive
from the moment the lightning strikes...

1162
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:41,110
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1163
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,738
When this alarm goes off, you hit the gas.

1164
01:32:43,863 --> 01:32:45,114
Right.

1165
01:32:51,704 --> 01:32:54,874
Well, I guess that's everything.

1166
01:32:58,961 --> 01:33:01,339
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1167
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:08,721
See you in about 30 years.

1168
01:33:10,556 --> 01:33:12,266
I hope so.

1169
01:33:13,559 --> 01:33:15,186
Don't worry!

1170
01:33:15,811 --> 01:33:17,521
<i>As long as you hit that wire...</i>

1171
01:33:17,605 --> 01:33:20,691
with the connecting hook
at precisely 88 miles an hour...

1172
01:33:20,775 --> 01:33:23,736
the instant the lightning
strikes the tower...

1173
01:33:26,197 --> 01:33:28,407
- Everything will be fine.
- Right.

1174
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:41,170
- What's the meaning of this?
- You'll find out in 30 years.

1175
01:33:41,254 --> 01:33:43,297
It's about the future, isn't it?

1176
01:33:43,422 --> 01:33:46,133
- Information about the future.
- Wait a minute.

1177
01:33:46,217 --> 01:33:48,177
I warned you about this, kid.

1178
01:33:48,261 --> 01:33:51,055
The consequences could be disastrous!

1179
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:53,558
Doc, that's a risk
you're going to have to take.

1180
01:33:53,683 --> 01:33:56,852
- Your life depends on it!
- No!

1181
01:33:56,978 --> 01:34:00,314
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

1182
01:34:00,606 --> 01:34:03,276
In that case, I'll tell you straight out.

1183
01:34:07,363 --> 01:34:08,739
Great Scott!

1184
01:34:16,706 --> 01:34:19,709
You get the cable,
I'll throw the rope down to you.

1185
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:21,961
Right! I got it!

1186
01:34:55,786 --> 01:34:57,038
Doc!

1187
01:35:04,712 --> 01:35:08,799
- Come on, come on. Let's go!
- All right! Take it up!

1188
01:35:12,261 --> 01:35:13,346
Go!

1189
01:35:20,436 --> 01:35:21,437
Doc!

1190
01:35:22,688 --> 01:35:26,192
I have to tell you about the future.

1191
01:35:26,275 --> 01:35:30,571
- What?
- I have to tell you about the future!

1192
01:35:30,738 --> 01:35:32,073
What?

1193
01:35:32,156 --> 01:35:36,869
On the night I go back in time you get...

1194
01:35:40,498 --> 01:35:41,832
Doc!

1195
01:35:51,092 --> 01:35:52,009
Go!

1196
01:35:53,052 --> 01:35:55,263
- No, Doc!
- Look at the time!

1197
01:35:55,596 --> 01:35:57,723
You've got less than four minutes.

1198
01:35:57,848 --> 01:35:59,559
<i>Please, hurry!</i>

1199
01:36:11,195 --> 01:36:12,530
Yeah!

1200
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:09,003
Damn it, Doc!
Why did you have to tear up that letter?

1201
01:37:09,128 --> 01:37:11,088
If I only had more time.

1202
01:37:14,091 --> 01:37:16,469
Wait a minute. I got all the time I want.

1203
01:37:16,552 --> 01:37:20,139
I got a time machine.
I can just go back early and warn him.

1204
01:37:20,223 --> 01:37:22,350
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.

1205
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:26,604
<i>Okay. Time circuit's on.</i>

1206
01:37:26,938 --> 01:37:29,607
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

1207
01:37:30,066 --> 01:37:32,109
Engine running. All right.

1208
01:37:34,987 --> 01:37:37,365
No. No, no.

1209
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:40,826
Come on. Come on. Not this time.

1210
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:52,481
Come on.

1211
01:38:54,609 --> 01:38:57,361
Here we go. Here we go.
This time. Come on.

1212
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:01,908
Please. Please. Come on!

1213
01:40:40,256 --> 01:40:41,632
Doc.

1214
01:42:17,812 --> 01:42:19,855
Crazy drunk driver.

1215
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:36,914
All right. Fred.

1216
01:42:38,791 --> 01:42:41,502
You look great. Everything looks great.

1217
01:42:42,878 --> 01:42:43,879
<i>1:24.</i>

1218
01:42:44,005 --> 01:42:46,882
I still got time. I'm coming, Doc!

1219
01:42:50,511 --> 01:42:52,889
No! No, not again!

1220
01:42:52,972 --> 01:42:55,433
Come on! Come on!

1221
01:43:09,071 --> 01:43:10,448
Libyans.

1222
01:43:33,012 --> 01:43:34,096
<i>No!</i>

1223
01:43:35,431 --> 01:43:36,766
<i>Bastards!</i>

1224
01:43:50,238 --> 01:43:51,572
Go!

1225
01:44:25,982 --> 01:44:28,109
Doc! Doc!

1226
01:44:35,116 --> 01:44:36,033
No!

1227
01:44:50,673 --> 01:44:52,133
You're alive.

1228
01:45:01,392 --> 01:45:02,935
Bulletproof vest?

1229
01:45:04,312 --> 01:45:06,272
How did you know?

1230
01:45:06,772 --> 01:45:09,442
<i>I never got a chance to tell you.</i>

1231
01:45:22,788 --> 01:45:26,792
What about all that talk
about screwing up future events?

1232
01:45:26,918 --> 01:45:28,878
The space-time continuum?

1233
01:45:29,462 --> 01:45:32,340
Well, I figured, what the hell.

1234
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,477
So how far ahead are you going?

1235
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:47,647
About 30 years. It's a nice round number.

1236
01:45:47,730 --> 01:45:49,857
Look me up when you get there, all right?

1237
01:45:49,941 --> 01:45:51,984
Guess I'll be about 47.

1238
01:45:52,276 --> 01:45:53,361
I will.

1239
01:45:53,945 --> 01:45:55,029
Take care.

1240
01:45:56,155 --> 01:45:57,156
You, too.

1241
01:45:57,406 --> 01:45:59,700
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.

1242
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:03,079
And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

1243
01:46:03,955 --> 01:46:04,956
You bet.

1244
01:47:10,271 --> 01:47:11,689
What a nightmare.

1245
01:47:22,867 --> 01:47:26,203
If Paul calls, tell him I'm working
at the boutique late.

1246
01:47:26,287 --> 01:47:28,331
Linda, I'm not your answering service...

1247
01:47:28,456 --> 01:47:31,959
and somebody named Greg or Craig
<i>called you just a little while ago.</i>

1248
01:47:32,043 --> 01:47:36,088
- Which one was it?
- I can't keep up with your boyfriends.

1249
01:47:38,674 --> 01:47:40,259
What the hell is this?

1250
01:47:41,052 --> 01:47:42,136
Breakfast.

1251
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,931
Did you sleep in your clothes again?

1252
01:47:45,223 --> 01:47:46,474
Yeah. L...

1253
01:47:47,642 --> 01:47:49,936
What are you wearing, Dave?

1254
01:47:50,353 --> 01:47:51,437
Marty...

1255
01:47:52,021 --> 01:47:54,232
I always wear a suit to the office.

1256
01:47:54,941 --> 01:47:56,651
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1257
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,779
- We need a rematch.
- A rematch?

1258
01:47:59,862 --> 01:48:01,989
- Why? Were you cheating?
- No.

1259
01:48:02,114 --> 01:48:03,824
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1260
01:48:06,035 --> 01:48:07,536
Mom! Dad!

1261
01:48:07,912 --> 01:48:10,456
- Hit your head?
- Are you okay?

1262
01:48:10,539 --> 01:48:13,626
You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.

1263
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:16,420
Why, thank you, Marty. George!

1264
01:48:17,964 --> 01:48:19,674
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1265
01:48:20,967 --> 01:48:23,719
- Good morning, kids.
- 'Morning.

1266
01:48:23,844 --> 01:48:26,389
Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.

1267
01:48:26,472 --> 01:48:30,059
I sure like her. She is such a sweet girl.

1268
01:48:30,601 --> 01:48:32,728
Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

1269
01:48:32,812 --> 01:48:34,605
What? What, Ma?

1270
01:48:34,730 --> 01:48:38,734
Aren't you going up to the lake?
You've been planning it for two weeks.

1271
01:48:38,943 --> 01:48:41,487
We talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

1272
01:48:41,696 --> 01:48:42,780
The car's wrecked.

1273
01:48:42,905 --> 01:48:44,407
- Wrecked?
- Wrecked?

1274
01:48:44,574 --> 01:48:46,784
When did this happen? Why wasn't I told?

1275
01:48:46,867 --> 01:48:50,454
- I'm sure the car is fine.
- Why am I the last to know?

1276
01:48:50,788 --> 01:48:53,624
See? There's Biff out there
waxing it now.

1277
01:48:54,292 --> 01:48:58,588
Now, Biff, I want to make sure we get
two coats of wax, not just one.

1278
01:48:58,713 --> 01:49:02,842
- I'm just finishing up the second coat now.
- Now, Biff, don't con me.

1279
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:06,387
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1280
01:49:06,596 --> 01:49:09,473
I meant I was just starting
on the second coat.

1281
01:49:10,224 --> 01:49:12,435
Biff. What a character.

1282
01:49:12,602 --> 01:49:14,979
<i>Always trying to get away with something.</i>

1283
01:49:15,104 --> 01:49:18,107
<i>I've had to stay on top of Biff</i>
<i>ever since high school.</i>

1284
01:49:18,190 --> 01:49:22,278
- But, if it wasn't for him...
- We'd never have fallen in love.

1285
01:49:24,030 --> 01:49:26,574
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

1286
01:49:26,782 --> 01:49:29,452
Hi, Marty. I think it's your new book.

1287
01:49:32,204 --> 01:49:34,582
Honey! Your first novel.

1288
01:49:36,083 --> 01:49:41,130
I've always told you, if you put your
mind to it, you can accomplish anything.

1289
01:49:41,339 --> 01:49:44,926
Marty, here's your keys.
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

1290
01:49:45,218 --> 01:49:46,135
Keys?

1291
01:50:02,693 --> 01:50:05,154
- How about a ride, mister?
- Jennifer!

1292
01:50:06,822 --> 01:50:08,783
Are you a sight for sore eyes.

1293
01:50:09,158 --> 01:50:10,868
Let me look at you.

1294
01:50:11,369 --> 01:50:14,247
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1295
01:50:14,330 --> 01:50:15,414
I haven't.

1296
01:50:16,332 --> 01:50:17,416
You okay?

1297
01:50:18,334 --> 01:50:20,127
Is everything all right?

1298
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:23,965
Yeah.

1299
01:50:26,217 --> 01:50:27,843
Everything is great.

1300
01:50:42,275 --> 01:50:43,192
Marty!

1301
01:50:44,610 --> 01:50:46,654
You've got to come back with me!

1302
01:50:47,321 --> 01:50:49,532
- Where?
- Back to the future.

1303
01:50:54,370 --> 01:50:56,163
What are you doing, Doc?

1304
01:50:57,540 --> 01:50:58,708
I need fuel.

1305
01:51:02,044 --> 01:51:04,171
Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

1306
01:51:04,547 --> 01:51:09,010
No, no. I just got here. Jennifer's here.
We're taking the new truck for a spin.

1307
01:51:09,093 --> 01:51:11,971
Bring her along. This concerns her, too.

1308
01:51:12,096 --> 01:51:15,600
What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?

1309
01:51:15,892 --> 01:51:18,853
- Do we become assholes or something?
- No, Marty.

1310
01:51:18,936 --> 01:51:22,273
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.

1311
01:51:22,356 --> 01:51:24,567
Something has got to be done
about your kids.

1312
01:51:30,990 --> 01:51:33,993
We better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

1313
01:51:34,118 --> 01:51:37,705
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.
