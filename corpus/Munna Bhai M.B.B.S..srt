1
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:59,232
Start the car!

2
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:04,493
It's not starting.
Push the car.

3
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:06,595
Hang on ...there we go!

4
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:13,235
What's happening?
Who's he? Who are you?

5
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:15,845
I'm just a simpIe man.
PIease save me!

6
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:18,913
Then why is he shooting at you?
- I don't know.

7
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,655
''Dude, is this some mafia nonsense?
I'II get screwed aIong with you!''

8
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:27,723
See that jeep behind us -
pIease go in that!

9
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,194
Is that him?

10
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:31,861
Oh god!

11
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:41,596
''Dear Iord!
Hey, do you know the Hanuman prayer?''

12
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:45,271
Gayatri mantra?
- I don't.

13
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:47,278
''Dude, sing any hymn you know!''

14
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:49,572
Now I Iay me down to sIeep...

15
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:51,850
We're dead meat!

16
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:53,943
''If I die before I wake,
I pray the Iord my souI to take...''

17
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:55,782
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

18
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:02,455
Go away! Don't foIIow me!
You'II get me kiIIed.

19
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,030
Shoo!
- Stop!

20
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,824
Shoo! Get Iost!
- PIease buddy!

21
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:11,101
''I'm outta here!
- PIease, Sir!''

22
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:50,332
Whoa! You again? Buzz off!

23
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:54,006
''PIease..., Taxi!
PIease... Don't Ieave me, Taxi.''

24
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:02,148
''Quick, caII the cops!''

25
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:04,014
''Good morning, Sire.''

26
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:06,018
WeIcome. Some tea?

27
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:09,784
Here...

28
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:13,764
''How's Iife, Ghanshyam?''

29
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,164
You? Here?

30
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:19,361
CaII your wife.
TeII her you've been kidnapped.

31
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,730
Two miIIion - cash. Got it?

32
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,569
But...

33
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:27,169
You borrowed money;
you didn't return it on time.

34
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:37,180
''Circuit, I'd said ''point the gun'',
not ''shoot aII over Mumbai!!''

35
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:39,183
ChiII out bro!

36
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:42,054
They're fake buIIets...
they just sting!

37
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:50,527
''Hey, FIo Jo, at this range even a fake
buIIet can do the job! What?''

38
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:54,202
Who are you peopIe?

39
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:01,212
You owe him 2 miIIion:
Pay up. Go home.

40
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:07,011
''But ManiIaI, you know
I paid your brother in time.''

41
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:10,848
My brother swindIed haIf the city
and fIed to Dubai.

42
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:16,555
I don't care what deaI you
guys had - I want my money.

43
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:18,659
But it was you
who asked me to pay him!!

44
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:22,768
I don't care!
I want my money back.

45
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,964
Hang on...
You paid back his brother?

46
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:28,603
Yes. Ask him.
- What does he care...?

47
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:30,105
Quiet!

48
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:37,578
''Dude, you made a big mistake.''

49
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:40,248
''Ghanshyam, go home.''

50
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:50,124
''And you, caII your wife.
- But... why?''

51
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:53,457
''Hey, don't fuse my circuit or...''

52
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,132
you'II be riding home
in three different bags!

53
00:05:56,536 --> 00:06:00,233
''TeII your woman to send 1 miIIion,
because you've been kidnapped.''

54
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,074
Why one miIIion?!

55
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:06,209
Because you were dishonest.

56
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:11,475
''My father says, ''Don't be dishonest,
and don't toIerate dishonesty.''

57
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:14,218
''Now, caII your wife!''

58
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,293
Grab him.
- Yes brother.

59
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:26,487
Quiet!

60
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:37,499
''TeIegram for MurIi Prasad Sharma!
- Open it, quick!''

61
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,907
When?

62
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,914
''The evening train, brother.
- Damn! We're screwed!''

63
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,575
''AaIam, caII Banwari! Move it!!''

64
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,180
''The boss's oId man is coming,
by the 5 o'cIock train...''

65
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,186
What?!
- But he aIways comes in JuIy...?

66
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:55,520
FooI! He's not the monsoon.
He can come whenever.

67
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:57,856
The Boss's dad is coming!
5 o'cIock!

68
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:06,196
''C'mon, hurry up!
Move it! We don't have time!''

69
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:45,370
''You're stiII a rookie, chiId.''

70
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,529
Sorry...Forgive me...
It was on the fIoor...

71
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,631
I was returning it...
I'm not a pickpocket.

72
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:53,643
BIoody thief! Pickpocket!
Let's beat him!

73
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:01,984
See how they're beating
the poor thing.

74
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:05,656
What are you doing?
Make way!

75
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:09,084
What are you doing? Leave him!
Why are you beating him?

76
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:13,655
''He stoIe from me, why are
aII of you getting excited?''

77
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,932
I wiII beat this man.
Come with me!

78
00:09:16,102 --> 00:09:18,662
''You don't know these ruffians, sir.
- Let us at him, we'II teach him!''

79
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,270
''WeII, shouId I...?
- No.''

80
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:22,998
Do you know who they are?

81
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:26,101
These are the peopIe of our country.
Look at their faces.

82
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:31,848
Someone's fought with his wife;
another's son won't Iisten to him.

83
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:34,176
''One's jeaIous of
his neighbour's success,''

84
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:36,413
and one has had it
with his IandIord's demands.

85
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:40,250
From the government's corruption
to the cricket team's defeat...

86
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,360
they're upset about everything.

87
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:48,023
''But their anger is siIent, bottIed up.
They'II pour it out on you.''

88
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,698
ShouId I hand you over to them?
They'II definiteIy crack your skuII!

89
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:55,034
No! Forgive me sir! I made a mistake!

90
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:59,040
Can't see them brother...
- Keep Iooking.

91
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:02,180
''AIright everyone,
he's Iearned his Iesson.''

92
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:04,710
Thank you for your heIp.

93
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,124
''Son, it's simpIer to Iive honestIy.
Understand?''

94
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:17,386
Namaste.
- BIess you.

95
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,721
Namaste.
- Good... God bIess...

96
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:23,395
What the heII are you doing here?
- You know him?

97
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:25,727
He...no.

98
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:27,728
Porter!

99
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:32,543
You're hurt.
Come... our son is a doctor.

100
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:35,741
He's here!

101
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:40,350
Let's go!
Hurry! Hurry!

102
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:45,556
Hey... you! Watch it!
The Iadder!

103
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,102
Hey... I'm hangin' here!!
Put it back! HeIp!

104
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:13,174
Wow! A new signboard?

105
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,113
''Yes. Was put up right after we
got the teIegram.... This way, Ma'am.''

106
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:19,055
''Go ahead, read it.''

107
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:23,193
''Read it quickIy, I want to meet my son.
Fine! I'II read it.''

108
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,197
That's his name. Happy?

109
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:31,526
Read your name?
Let's go in.

110
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:35,205
Even my son ran away from the viIIage.

111
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:42,145
''But, unIike you, he worked hard and
became a doctor. Let's go.''

112
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:47,475
It's what we feared -
Lymphosarcoma of the intestines.

113
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,811
''Doc, wiII I Iive?''

114
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:55,992
''Yes, because onIy Dr.MurIi Prasad Sharma
knows the cure for this disease.''

115
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:57,218
ReaIIy?

116
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,394
''Father, you're here!''

117
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,632
''God bIess you, son.''

118
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:04,631
How are you Ma?
- Fine. How are you?

119
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:06,394
Me? Great!

120
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:10,406
''Great? He works day and night,
ignoring his own heaIth.''

121
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:15,644
That's my son! SeIfIessness is
the sure way to heaven.

122
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:16,837
''Thanks, father.''

123
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:20,508
''Oh, and Iook at this chiId -
he's bIeeding.''

124
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,853
The doctor wiII fix you up.

125
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:29,853
You...? A doctor?!

126
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:35,031
''Dr. Lohanna, it's a deep cut -
an emergency - fix it!''

127
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:37,199
But...

128
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:42,534
Don't worry. Dr. Lohanna wiII
deaI with him.

129
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,867
You must be tired. Go rest.

130
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,877
Seeing you makes us Iess weary.

131
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:52,012
Shhh... Quiet!

132
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,316
What happened?
- They're punching...

133
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:58,486
Stitching... him up. It's painfuI.

134
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:02,886
I've brought it! Here!

135
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:08,298
''1 miIIion.
Let my husband go, pIease!''

136
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,703
''Shut up! Remember, Brother's a doctor!''

137
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:31,057
''Sorry madam, if money couId save Iives
then the rich wouId never die.''

138
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:37,428
''Circuit, heIp the Iady.
- Huh!? ...Yes, doctor.''

139
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:39,053
Madam...

140
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:41,165
But I...
- PIease come with me.

141
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:42,926
Don't worry.
Everything wiII be fine

142
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:49,932
Her husband was so obese
the Iiposuction took a week!

143
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,936
Is this aII of it?
- Yes

144
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,945
ChiII sis! Go sit in the car.
He'II be right out.

145
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,942
Soon...?
- Don't you worry!

146
00:13:57,183 --> 00:13:59,174
Goddamn rodent! Beat it!

147
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:01,610
You carry on son.

148
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:06,618
''Hey, didn't we meet the Iast time too?''

149
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:10,289
Are you ok?
- No it's...

150
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:12,762
I'm ... I'm...

151
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,635
''Dr.Monty,
take my parents inside, quick.''

152
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,312
''Nurse, get me the chIoroform.''

153
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:31,972
What?

154
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:37,987
You over-acting piece of crap...

155
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:41,323
''Look at him, what a naturaI!''

156
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:44,792
He's been acting for three years and
father's never recognised him.

157
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:48,992
''Get up, jerk! You're cured.
Now, get out!''

158
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:51,993
What the heII is going on?

159
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:55,000
It's a Iong story! Scram!

160
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:15,019
''Brother, if it hurts you so much...''

161
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,023
...why don't you just teII
your father the truth?

162
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:30,438
''TeII him, in this city a don gets
more respect than any damn doc.''

163
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:35,203
He'II die if he gets to know...

164
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:40,041
''Its just seven days of drama, Circuit.
Let it be.''

165
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:53,063
''Ma, remember when I saw a ghost
near the cemetery?''

166
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:57,066
And it was Chandu who was sIeepwaIking.

167
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,561
And father had raised his cane...

168
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,399
''FooI! Why did you go
near the cemetery?''

169
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:05,873
I was so scared.

170
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:08,738
Scared? You were shaking!

171
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:15,076
And you hugged me...
And I feIt nothing couId scare me

172
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:18,883
You used to caII it something...?
- The Magic Hug!

173
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:20,750
The Magic Hug!

174
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:30,898
Get up.
- What...?

175
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,101
Do as I say.

176
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:36,597
Come here.

177
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:41,002
''Now teII me, what's bothering you?''

178
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,116
''Ma, if I wasn't a doctor...''

179
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:47,783
What are you two up to?

180
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,917
''Nothing father. Just nostaIgia,
about the viIIage...''

181
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:53,580
So come back. You are so famous
in the viIIage today.

182
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:57,391
''The naughtiest kid who became
a big doctor in the city!''

183
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,921
''He wasn't the naughtiest.
- Ah, right.''

184
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:05,468
''It was I who stoIe fruits,
set fire to peopIe's trousers... right?''

185
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:18,548
'Morning sir!
- 'Morning... What's going on?

186
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:21,317
''Oh, nothing.
They're Ioony bins. How's the Doc?''

187
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:23,578
He's fine. How much for a coconut?

188
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:26,156
WouId I ever accept
money from you?

189
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,483
''WouId you Iike one with water,
or a creamy one?''

190
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,752
Neither...if it's free.

191
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:32,828
PIease don't do this!
- Ok ...I'm off!

192
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:35,160
''Stop, sir! I was kidding. PIease...''

193
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:36,957
A coconut pIease.

194
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,763
Fifteen bucks for a creamy
one and ten for water!

195
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:44,966
''Excuse me, do I know you?''

196
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:49,614
''I don't know about that, but
I certainIy know you, Dr. Asthana.''

197
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:59,985
Mr. Sharma!
- Correct!

198
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:03,184
How are you Mr. Sharma?
- You know each other?

199
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,861
Of course. When we finaIIy
got a hospitaI...

200
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:08,189
he was the first doctor
to come to the viIIage.

201
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:10,858
''He stayed for two years!
- Yes, but you, here?''

202
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:13,797
My son Munna has a hospitaI here.

203
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,903
Munna's hospitaI?
- Yes.

204
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:18,007
I don't understand.
- You don't need to.

205
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,540
Which coconut wouId you Iike?
- HoId on.

206
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:22,942
Munna's a doctor??

207
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:27,218
''Remember, I had toId you my son
wouId become a doctor someday?''

208
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:30,889
You did sir... now shouId
I cut a cream coconut?

209
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:32,554
Hang on.

210
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:36,558
''Surprising...I Iive near by,
and I don't know of this hospitaI.''

211
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:39,592
Forget about it! What's that
got to do with my coconuts? You...

212
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:42,231
Damn you and your coconuts.
Stop it I say.

213
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,231
Lets go to my house.
- Sure.

214
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:55,239
''So, you say your son's
hospitaI is cIose by?''

215
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:58,242
But I know aII the doctors around...
- Bananas?

216
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,067
''This standing around,
Iaughing IoudIy... what is that?''

217
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:18,463
Laughter therapy.

218
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:23,870
''If you're tense, or angry,
you Iaugh IoudIy...''

219
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:26,073
it Iowers the bIood pressure.

220
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:29,076
But how do you Iaugh when you're tense?
- Practice!

221
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:33,282
''Look at me. The angrier I get,
the harder I Iaugh''

222
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:34,880
PIease sit.

223
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:39,290
PIease get another cup.
- Right away.

224
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,893
So where did Munna get
his M.B.B.S. degree from?

225
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:44,858
I don't know.

226
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,089
He was in high schooI when
he ran away from home.

227
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:50,291
It was my fauIt - I was too strict.

228
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:52,637
I wanted him to be a doctor...

229
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:55,102
but he kept fIunking.
- I remember.

230
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:59,300
I was so scared that he wouId
become a criminaI...

231
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:02,310
''but fifteen years Iater
he caIIed and said,''

232
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:05,647
Father I've become a doctor.

233
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:10,510
I can't express the joy I feIt.

234
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:13,316
Tea.

235
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:18,725
''Mr. Sharma, good things
happen to good peopIe.''

236
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:22,323
And how's your daughter Chinki?
- Good.

237
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:25,326
What does she do now?
- She's a doctor.

238
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:34,005
Is she married?
- I'm stiII Iooking for a groom -

239
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:37,008
''she insists on getting married
onIy to a doctor, someone she knows.''

240
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:38,873
She's right.

241
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:43,151
''WeII, there is a doctor
Chinki's known as a chiId.''

242
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:47,524
''Co-incidentaIIy,
I have his photo right here.''

243
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,161
What do you say?

244
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:02,798
Marriage! Not for me!
It'II be a big probIem.

245
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,970
Fine. Lets go Parvati.
- Where?

246
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:12,842
To our viIIage! No one there negates
their parents' wishes so merciIessIy.

247
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:17,719
What is aII this? Mom...
- He's right.

248
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,385
My poor IittIe heart
had just one Iast wish...

249
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,855
...to pIay with my grandkids.

250
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:27,396
Looks Iike I'II die without that joy

251
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,395
''You're making a mountain out of
a moIehiII. Circuit, expIain to them!''

252
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:38,138
''Sir, you see...''

253
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:43,746
Brother is so busy 24/7...

254
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,941
the wife wouIdn't understand the
pressures of running the hospitaI...

255
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:51,412
''UnIess, of course,
she was a doctor herseIf.''

256
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:56,023
That's true. OnIy a doctor can
understand a doctor's pressures.

257
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:59,226
ExactIy. Father...

258
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,958
Why are you smiIing Iike that?

259
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:08,972
Mom? You too?

260
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:11,106
We've found a Iady doctor for you.

261
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:14,105
And you have an appointment
with her tomorrow.

262
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:16,243
What doctor?!

263
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:18,708
Chinki.

264
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:22,453
Chinki! What kind of name is that?

265
00:22:24,456 --> 00:22:26,788
Hang on...That Chinki?!

266
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:35,456
Brother how is Chinki to Iook at?

267
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:38,467
''Like, reaIIy pretty?''

268
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:45,466
''WeII, when we were kids, she was a
fatso with two oiIed pigtaiIs,''

269
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:48,477
...and a perenniaI running nose.

270
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:51,806
We pIayed together a Iot.

271
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:54,611
''I'd be the doctor,
and she'd be the wife.''

272
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:57,989
''I'd go to the cIinic,
she'd stay home and cook.''

273
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:02,926
''WeII then, marriage sounds
Iike a good idea.''

274
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:05,486
''Use your head, Circuit!''

275
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:08,228
In two days she'II see right
through this doctor drama!

276
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,230
''Just say, ''Dude, I'm not a doctor.
So bite me!!''

277
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:16,164
You taIk Iike a doofus sometimes.
Why shouId I ruin her Iife?

278
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,503
''But Brother, something has to be done.
- You're right...''

279
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:25,173
Something must be done.

280
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:28,543
''Chinki! Munna's phone caII, for you.''

281
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:31,311
Munna?

282
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,851
''Go on, taIk to him.''

283
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:43,534
''Dad, do you mind?
- No, I don't mind.''

284
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:46,527
TaIk niceIy with him.
- OK dad.

285
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:50,136
''I'II speak niceIy,
I'II marry him niceIy...''

286
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:53,543
''we'II have nice IittIe chiIdren,
and they'II caII you grandpa.''

287
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,540
''Now, some privacy pIease?''

288
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:57,981
''HeIIo, Chinki?''

289
00:23:58,183 --> 00:24:00,549
''Good morning, doctor.
You're an earIy riser.''

290
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:04,889
No. I haven't sIept aII night.
- Why? Was there an emergency?

291
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:08,725
Damn straight! I'm up shit creek
and sinking fast.

292
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:15,362
Why are you Iaughing?
- You're taIking funny.

293
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:17,166
It's how I speak.

294
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,568
''Fine, Iet's taIk your taIk then...
Wassup?! Gimme the dope on your Iife.''

295
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,239
''The buzz is you're a doc now, dude...''

296
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:28,571
''I'm not a doctor.
- Like, I know.''

297
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:31,576
Say what?
- I've known you for ages.

298
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,387
''You were a IittIe ruffian,
and you're stiII the same, bro...''

299
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:41,056
''I'm not a ruffian, babe!
I'm a sociaI worker.''

300
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:43,592
''I provide financiaI heIp, get it?''

301
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:46,594
Munna! Do you taIk Iike
this to your patients as weII?

302
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:50,268
''Patients?! I'm serious, Chinki,
I'm not a doctor.''

303
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:54,265
I don't have time to expIain.

304
00:24:54,606 --> 00:25:01,603
''When I come over, you reject me -
say I'm ugIy - anything.''

305
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:07,613
''And pIease, make sure my father doesn't
find out - if he does, he'II die.''

306
00:25:10,622 --> 00:25:13,284
''Gotta go. Reject me, OK?''

307
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:21,429
Your mother has bought
this for you.

308
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,964
You'II Iook regaI in it.

309
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:29,169
''Hurry, your mother's ready and waiting.''

310
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,647
''Lakshmi, get the sugar separateIy
from the tea.''

311
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:44,849
What happened?

312
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,983
Someone owes you money?
- Money?

313
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:51,986
Wanna kidnap someone?
- What?!

314
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:55,833
Wanna have someone roughed up?
- What nonsense!

315
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:58,466
Then why is this photo here?

316
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:00,969
This is Chinki's
prospective bridegroom.

317
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:04,267
She's marrying that gangster -
Munna!?!

318
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:23,354
What happened?

319
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:25,890
''Chinki, go to the hospitaI.''

320
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:30,031
But... isn't Munna coming?
- I forgot to teII you.

321
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:32,693
It's postponed tiII next week.
- But dad...

322
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:37,937
''Hurry up, fast!
I have some work here.''

323
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:47,377
''Good morning, sir.
- Shut up, man! I Iook Iike a dork!''

324
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:51,450
Now Iisten - caII me every
5 minutes with an 'emergency'.

325
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:55,793
''If I'm not out in 20, get me out.''

326
00:26:56,728 --> 00:26:59,390
''ChiII, Brother. Chinki's on it,
she'II reject you.''

327
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:01,058
''HeIIo, sir.''

328
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:04,395
''Let's go, son.''

329
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:19,080
See? Laughter therapy.

330
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:22,750
''Yes, he must be nervous.''

331
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:37,257
''Munna, where did you get your
M.B.B.S degree?''

332
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:44,105
Doctors' degree...

333
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:49,110
Err... Dongri MedicaI CoIIege.

334
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:55,446
What is your speciaIisation?

335
00:27:56,788 --> 00:28:01,054
''Hands? Feet? Bones?
Or, just...the throat?''

336
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:09,392
''Is everything OK? No stress, no mess?''

337
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:13,794
''Right, put him on gIucose, and
caII me if there's an emergency, OK?''

338
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:15,198
Right.

339
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:23,978
Your parents are very proud of
your achievements.

340
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:30,220
Do you feeI proud too?
- No. I'm just a humbIe man.

341
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:33,488
You're not proud?

342
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:37,894
''Then are you ashamed, doctor?''

343
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,365
''TaIk to me. Come on, answer me.''

344
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:56,646
When you see pride and happiness
on their faces...

345
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:09,226
No answer...
Looks Iike there is a probIem.

346
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:12,261
''Let's go, father.
I'm not interested in Chinki.''

347
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:16,365
You are not interested in her?!
Who are you. What are you?

348
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,664
She's a doctor.

349
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:22,469
Do you know a doctors status!

350
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:24,101
''Father, Iet's go!''

351
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,302
''Sir, pIease be forthright.
What are you impIying?''

352
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,142
''Sure, Sir.''

353
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:37,050
Your son is a mobster.
He kidnaps peopIe for money.

354
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:41,891
''If you knew this, then
you're a bigger fraud than him;''

355
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,494
''and if you didn't know,
then you're the biggest fooI on Earth!''

356
00:29:46,698 --> 00:29:48,222
Enough!

357
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,234
That's it.

358
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:55,900
Munna... is this true?

359
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,510
''You are a doctor, yes?''

360
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:40,179
''Sir, I beg your forgiveness.
I spoke too soon.''

361
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,352
Doctor! The patient in no. 4
has fainted. Hurry!

362
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:09,643
At Ieast wear your turban.
- How can I?

363
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:13,643
Munna has stripped us of our dignity.
- But he's our son. Forgive him.

364
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:17,648
''Enough, Parvati! It takes a Iifetime
to earn respect...''

365
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:21,990
and your son.... Let's go.

366
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:40,442
He has never stepped out
without his turban.

367
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:54,515
Why did you do this Munna?

368
00:31:57,229 --> 00:31:59,220
''I was afraid, Ma.''

369
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:02,698
''After years, when I spoke to him...''

370
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:06,697
''I thought he'd say ''How are you?''

371
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:10,539
''Instead, he asked,
What do you do in Mumbai?''

372
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,040
''I hope you aren't a
no-good ruffian or crook.''

373
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,779
''I was scared, Ma.''

374
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:21,210
''Without thinking I said,
I'm a doctor.''

375
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:34,656
''Stop him, Ma.''

376
00:32:37,235 --> 00:32:39,226
He won't stop.

377
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:55,749
Ma... give me a 'Magic Hug'...

378
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:02,255
''Parvati, Iet's Ieave!''

379
00:33:32,257 --> 00:33:38,924
What did I teII Chinki?
I don't want to marry you.

380
00:33:39,597 --> 00:33:43,795
''Just Iet's not upset my father.'' Right?''

381
00:33:45,337 --> 00:33:46,668
Correct.

382
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,630
You want to do something about it...
- No.

383
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:53,133
''She's a chiIdhood buddy,
and a doctor too.''

384
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:58,138
''You know,
onIy doctors are respected?''

385
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:03,544
''We don't deserve respect,
onIy doctors do.''

386
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:12,156
BIoody.... Hey!
Don't touch the signboard.

387
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:15,656
My father's name is on it.
Hands off!

388
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,434
CaIm down.

389
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:19,827
Bastards! Don't you dare!

390
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:29,169
My oId man cried.

391
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:34,842
''He'd never cried, and I made him.''

392
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:38,979
''Brother, we aII cried.''

393
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,182
You know why?

394
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:46,925
Because I'm not a doctor.

395
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:49,857
I've upset everyone.

396
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:06,677
''Circuit, I'm gonna be a doc too.''

397
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:12,813
''Brother, Iets taIk about it tomorrow.''

398
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:16,887
I knew you'd say that...
that I'm sIoshed...

399
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:19,719
I'II forget by tomorrow...

400
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:25,828
''Brother, forget it. What's the point?
- The point?''

401
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,231
I'II become a doctor
and marry Chinki.

402
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:36,403
And that Dr. Asthana... you don't
know what he said.

403
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:39,912
''I was there,
and I was siIent.''

404
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:44,585
I'II show him! I'II be a doctor!

405
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:51,591
''Circuit, find out, which is
the best medicaI coIIege in Mumbai.''

406
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,262
Out of the way!

407
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:28,522
I'II ask this guy.

408
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:30,924
''Hey, 'Safari Suit'
- What?''

409
00:36:31,302 --> 00:36:34,294
''Whom does one see for admission?
- FiII the form, over there.''

410
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:37,103
Who's the patient?
- No one.

411
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,366
Then who's to be admitted?
- Brother.

412
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:41,101
What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

413
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:43,109
Then why admit him?
- He wants to be a doctor.

414
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:44,579
Who?
- Brother!

415
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:46,740

''Yeah, right. And I want to

418
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:56,725
''Enough of your crap.
Now, whom do we meet?''

419
00:36:57,328 --> 00:37:02,322
You want to become doctor...

420
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:04,324
What's a 'dean'?

421
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:07,994
''Errr...the headmaster, Iike,
a coIIege principaI.''

422
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:11,001
He's in charge of admissions.
- Where is he?

423
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:13,139
''In the Operation theatre, upstairs.''

424
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:26,516
Who's the dean here?

00:37:51,382 --> 00:37:52,644
Say what?
- High schooI...

429
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:56,550
How much did you score?
- How much do you need for admission?

430
00:37:56,788 --> 00:38:00,121
At Ieast ninety percent!
- That's what I got.

431
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,983
Right. We'II have a certificate

432
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:05,890
''OK, then you must sit for a
pre-medicaI entrance exam.''

433
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:09,389
''If you pass, you're in.''

434
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:12,395
''But, who wants admission?''

435
00:38:12,737 --> 00:38:16,833
Is this exam necessary?

''Hey Rusty,

447
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,524
This is wrong!

448
00:39:08,693 --> 00:39:11,958
''Dump the tension, dude.
Your pop is with us.''

449

''Doc, get a move on. I don't

00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:14,151
''But we won't care, because, you see''

495
00:45:16,894 --> 00:45:20,295
''This dream, our dream,''

496
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,163
''won't break, break, break!''

497
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,461
''Oh! What's your name, dude?''

498
00:45:28,706 --> 00:45:30,435
''Oh! What's your name, dude?''

499
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:33,639
My name? You haven't heard yet!?

500
00:45:34,078 --> 00:45:37,844
''Brother Munna, M.B.B.S.!''

501
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:10,880
''Hey, move this stuff, man!
Move it, make it quick, man!''

502
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:34,064
''Ten or twenty bypasses a day -
no tension!''

503
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:36,565
''Too easy, bro!''

504
00:46:38,642 --> 00:46:42,237
''I'II forget eat and drink -
no tension!''

505
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:49,909
In doIIars wiII be my pay

506
00:46:50,354 --> 00:46:54,120
The waIIet wiII sing everyday

507
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:58,321
I'II dance and make the others too

508
00:46:58,729 --> 00:47:01,926
They'II do the disco in a pink tutu

509
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:06,499
''We wiII find our Eden, and hey''

510
00:47:06,937 --> 00:47:10,202
A new song it'II be everyday

511
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:14,534
''To cooI bars, in new cars,''

512
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:18,446
We wiII make our merry way

513
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:24,546
''The girIs
Oh with their IoveIy curIs''

514
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:30,290
''WiII be weIcome
For a free heart check, check, check!!''

515
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:32,626
''Hey! What's your name, dude?''

516
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,957
''Hey! What's your name, dude?''

517
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:37,961
My name? You haven't heard yet?!

518
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:41,969
Brother Munna MBBS!

519
00:47:58,189 --> 00:48:00,987
''Brother, eat your meaIs on time.
- And write to us.''

520
00:48:01,992 --> 00:48:05,587
Is this a bride's send-off?!
- But... we'II miss you.

521
00:48:05,996 --> 00:48:07,896
''HandIe these Ioonies, Circuit.
- Carry on, Brother.''

522
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:10,329
Move it 'Drama Company'... March!

523
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:29,450
''Hey, what's wrong with him?
- Attempted suicide - he ate poison.''

524
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,011
Then why is he Iying here -
take him inside!

525
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:34,247
His mom has stiII to fiII the form.

526
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:37,516
PIease hurry!

527
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:43,693
Doc... He's dying.
Do something.

528
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:46,027
Sorry. Take him to CasuaIty.
I'm off duty.

529
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:54,703
''For an 'attempted suicide' case,
a poIice form must be fiIIed first.''

530
00:48:57,948 --> 00:49:00,178
What if I 'attempted murder' you -

531
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:03,445
''wiII the hospitaI save you or
fiII a form first, huh?!''

532
00:49:06,056 --> 00:49:07,318
CarefuI.

533
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,052
Over here.

534
00:49:12,096 --> 00:49:14,064
PIease wait here.

535
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:17,795
Is he your boy?
- Yes.

536
00:49:18,068 --> 00:49:21,504
Dump the tension. They'II get
aII the junk out of him in no time.

537
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:23,662
''Who are you, dear boy?''

538
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:26,741
MurIi Prasad Sharma. First year.
Entrance exam topper.

539
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:31,739
''I gotta run to cIass.
If the doc bugs you, caII me.''

540
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:33,879
Keep working on him Doc!

541
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:51,427
What?

542
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:54,593
Where is the first year cIassroom?
- Why?

543
00:49:55,306 --> 00:49:56,637
What 'why'?

544
00:49:57,107 --> 00:49:58,904
Why are you Iooking for the cIassroom?

545
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:02,101
Because I'm Iate.
- For what?

546
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:07,509
The cIass. Today is my first day.
- But what wiII you do in the cIassroom?

547
00:50:08,452 --> 00:50:10,215
I'm a student.

548
00:50:12,189 --> 00:50:13,281
Student?

549
00:50:13,457 --> 00:50:16,722
Entrance exam topper....
Where's the cIass.

550
00:50:22,132 --> 00:50:25,465
Where's the cIass.
- You're a student?

551
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:30,734
I'II teII you what...
what's your name?

552
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,800
Dr. Suman.

553
00:50:35,279 --> 00:50:37,747
''Dump the tension,
I'II find the cIassroom myseIf.''

554
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:43,949
''Where's the first-year cIass?
- Straight, then Ieft...''

555
00:50:53,163 --> 00:50:54,960
Good Morning sir!

556
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,169
What's up?

557
00:51:33,604 --> 00:51:35,868
I Iike to teII you...

558
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:42,545
The country's best doctors
have studied in this very haII.

559
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:46,207
They sat on these very benches.

560
00:51:46,884 --> 00:51:49,375
Just Iike you are sitting.

561
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,621
''Circuit, you had to seIect
this coIIege, didn't you!''

562
00:51:53,223 --> 00:51:59,822
You shouId be proud that you are to be
a part of the 150-year-oId institution.

563
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:02,632
''He's right here,
yapping about something.''

564
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:11,639
Which one of you wants to
be a good doctor?

565
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:21,974
Do you think you'II be
a good doctor?

566
00:52:25,422 --> 00:52:28,585
''Why, what's speciaI about you?''

567
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:34,587
I beIieve I can feeI
the patients suffering.

568
00:52:34,998 --> 00:52:38,263
''I want to treat them as friends,
not just as patients.''

569
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:48,269
In my 25-year career I haven't
befriended a singIe patient.

570
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:54,273
''I have not feIt their pain,
just cured it.''

571
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:17,296
See this hand...Rock steady.

572
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:23,645
''It's done thousands of operations,
but it never shook.''

573
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:30,685
''But if I were to operate on
my daughter, it wiII shake for sure.''

574
00:53:31,889 --> 00:53:36,326
Why? Because I Iove my daughter.

575
00:53:38,328 --> 00:53:43,322
''Friendship, empathy, attachment-
these are weaknesses for a doctor.''

576
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:48,337
For the next five years...

577
00:53:49,406 --> 00:53:57,336
''...you'II be taught that a patient
is just a sick body, nothing eIse.''

578
00:54:07,691 --> 00:54:12,492
If someone is dying outside the CasuaIty
Ward is it necessary to fiII a form?

579
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:23,771
Your cIasses start tomorrow at 8:00 AM.
Thank you very much.

580
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:41,789
I don't get it!
How did he get so far?

581
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:54,393
''Dad, it's OK!
Why do you get so excited?''

582
00:54:54,805 --> 00:54:57,797
I am not excited!
Do you know who he is?

583
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:00,740
A thug! The don of our area!

584
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:04,077
Hang on...

585
00:55:05,482 --> 00:55:08,417
''he hasn't seen you here, has he?
- Yes, he did.''

586
00:55:09,586 --> 00:55:11,213
Did he recognise you?

587
00:55:12,322 --> 00:55:15,223
Of course not.
He's never seen me before.

588
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:22,023
He shouId never know that
you're my daughter. Understand?

589
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:26,764
Nobody shouId know that Suman
is my daughter!

590
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:38,440
''Brother, why do you want
to Iive in the hosteI?''

591
00:55:39,449 --> 00:55:41,713
''Excuse me bro, where is no. 12?
- Right here.''

592
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:48,456
What the...! This room
ends before it begins.

593
00:55:48,925 --> 00:55:53,123
Do you know why God sent me
to this particuIar coIIege?

594
00:55:53,797 --> 00:55:55,788
God certainIy didn't teII me.

595
00:55:56,133 --> 00:56:01,036
''God said, ''Go, settIe the score
with the man who made your father cry.''

596
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:02,733
''Right said, Brother.''

597
00:56:02,839 --> 00:56:05,137
''You've discussed it with God,
then it's settIed.''

598
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:07,204
''FeIIas, move the stuff in.''

599
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:11,470
''Brother, I say we move this waII and
take over the next room -''

600
00:56:11,715 --> 00:56:15,151
we'II get more space here.
Keep the TV on the tabIe.

601
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:19,148
''Brother, Iets break this waII too -
we'II move the neighbour and...''

602
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,151
''buiId you a nice, big bathroom,
jacuzzi...Here.''

603
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:24,650
Keep the bags down.

604
00:56:24,995 --> 00:56:28,487
''Yo, buzzy-bee, move your bag.
The air conditioner goes there....''

605
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:32,163
''Refrigerator, here.''

606
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:35,164
''Brother, watch how
I jazz up this room.''

607
00:56:36,506 --> 00:56:38,736
Excuse me.
WiII you stay here as weII?

608
00:56:39,009 --> 00:56:42,172
''Yes, I'II sIeep in the fridge.
Shut up!''

609
00:56:42,512 --> 00:56:46,505
''Dump the tension, Circuit.''

610
00:56:47,517 --> 00:56:49,314
''Yo, buzzy-bee, come here.''

611
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:55,082
What's your name?
- Nagarajan Swami

612
00:56:55,525 --> 00:56:59,518
''Look Swami, reIax! Grab a coId drink,
watch TV, and enjoy.''

613
00:56:59,963 --> 00:57:03,524
What is mine is yours...
except for my underwear!

614
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:17,540
''Strip, then I'II teII you.
- Look, ragging is not aIIowed!''

615
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:21,712
Of course it's aIIowed.
Who said it isn't? WaIk this way...

616
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:33,225
Shake it baby!

617
00:57:40,737 --> 00:57:42,728
''Doctors, introduce yourseIves!''

618
00:57:44,574 --> 00:57:47,304
''I'm Dr. P.P. Ashok.
- Hey, bIack undy, come on!''

619
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,777
Dr. Mahesh KripIani

620
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:54,576
''No, no, pIease! My pants!''

621
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:57,179
Hey! Is this ragging?

622
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:00,749
I'm Dr. AniI Davda

623
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:02,915
This is fun.

624
00:58:04,528 --> 00:58:07,588
''Hey, I wanna do this too.''

625
00:58:09,766 --> 00:58:11,757
I'm Dr. MurIi Prasad Sharma.

626
00:58:26,616 --> 00:58:28,607
What eIse?
- That's enough.

627
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:30,615
Ragging's over.

628
00:58:31,621 --> 00:58:33,612
Hey 'dispensary'! Cut the crap.

629
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:37,616
''Brother said to rag him,
means you rag him.''

630
00:58:39,095 --> 00:58:41,620
''Hey Swami, you rag'em.
I wanna watch.''

631
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:45,358
''Dump the tension, dude... I'm here.''

632
00:59:15,665 --> 00:59:19,829
Have some chickpeas - they're
good for your bones. Lots of caIcium.

633
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:23,666
Let me study. I came second
in the entrance exams.

634
00:59:23,974 --> 00:59:26,340
How do you think
I got the first pIace...?

635
00:59:26,676 --> 00:59:28,667
By eating chickpeas. Have some.

636
00:59:38,688 --> 00:59:41,680
''I asked a question yesterday,
you haven't answered yet.''

637
00:59:44,394 --> 00:59:45,383
C'mon dude!

638
00:59:47,697 --> 00:59:51,030
How can a dying man be
expected to fiII a form!

639
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:54,096
''And if he dies whiIe fiIIing it,
who's responsibIe?''

640
00:59:56,306 --> 00:59:57,295
Say what!

641
00:59:57,507 --> 00:59:59,168
Get out!
- Why 'get out'?

642
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:03,702
''I topped, and I paid the fees -
I ain't going nowhere!''

643
01:00:07,884 --> 01:00:10,876
If this man doesn't Ieave at once...

644
01:00:11,888 --> 01:00:14,516
then there wiII be no more Iectures
on Anatomy this year.

645
01:00:17,727 --> 01:00:19,058
Munna! Go!

646
01:00:19,296 --> 01:00:20,729
Go! Go!

647
01:00:24,267 --> 01:00:26,064
Fine. Fine! I'II Ieave.

648
01:00:26,269 --> 01:00:29,067
Why shouId anyone eIse Iose out.

649
01:00:33,743 --> 01:00:36,143
''Hey Swami...pay attention,
and teach me Iater.''

650
01:00:37,747 --> 01:00:39,738
Gimme the chickpeas!

651
01:00:43,486 --> 01:00:45,750
''Dump the tension, dude.
Have some chickpeas.''

652
01:00:46,656 --> 01:00:48,419
''No? CooI, more for me.''

653
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:02,430
''Circuit, man, I reaIIy twisted
the dean's knickers today.''

654
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:04,763
He got pissed-off and
asked me to get out!

655
01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:11,572
''I said, ''Why get out? I've paid
my fees.'' He was about to cry!''

656
01:01:12,782 --> 01:01:16,115
Why are you making a racket?
- Why shouIdn't I?

657
01:01:16,786 --> 01:01:19,778
It's my father-in-Iaw's coIIege;
I'II get it as dowry.

658
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:23,123
Why aren't you in cIass?
- My dear father-in-Iaw...

659
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,295
''J dot Asthana, threw me out.''

660
01:01:26,796 --> 01:01:30,459
''He's pissed-off, because I topped.''

661
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,791
You must have done something!

662
01:01:33,036 --> 01:01:36,597
''I just asked a simpIe question,
he toId me to beat it.''

663
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:40,474
''Both father and daughter are the same-
you speak poIiteIy, and...''

664
01:01:40,744 --> 01:01:42,473
What did she do?

665
01:01:42,812 --> 01:01:45,372
I made a smaII request:
that she keep quiet.

666
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:48,149
But she's Iike her father.

667
01:01:49,219 --> 01:01:52,154
She busted me in front of my parents.

668
01:01:55,492 --> 01:01:57,153
''Hang on, what's your name?''

669
01:01:58,828 --> 01:02:01,820
Dr. Suman...dump the tension.

670
01:02:02,232 --> 01:02:05,429
It's a Iong story- some other time.
Gotta go now.

671
01:02:07,837 --> 01:02:10,169
''Like I was saying,
the baIdy was aII fIustered.''

672
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,837
This is the beginning.
You just wait and watch what I do.

673
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:22,641
''First, starting from the neck,
make an incision down the centre.''

674
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:33,859
Ew! It stinks!

675
01:02:37,867 --> 01:02:39,732
Out of the way! I can't see.

676
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:43,268
Why don't you get a body of your own.

677
01:02:56,352 --> 01:02:57,876
Who dat?
- Your pop

678
01:02:58,288 --> 01:03:02,884
Brother! How are you?
- I need a body.

679
01:03:05,695 --> 01:03:10,564
''Whose body?
- Like, for dissection.''

680
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,628
''Brother, where do I find such a body?''

681
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,268
How wouId I know?
Just find one.

682
01:03:16,906 --> 01:03:18,897
''Dump the tension, Brother.
You concentrate on your studies.''

683
01:03:19,242 --> 01:03:22,075
I'II organize the body.

684
01:03:24,914 --> 01:03:26,711
Brother! I found a body.

685
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:29,577
WiII an imported one do?
- Yeah. Just get it quick.

686
01:03:29,919 --> 01:03:31,443
''10 minutes, Brother.''

687
01:03:32,322 --> 01:03:35,257
''Butkya, get a sack.
- Right away.''

688
01:03:41,998 --> 01:03:45,934
''Yo, chiIIi chicken, wanna cIick
an ambuIance. It's a 5-star modeI.''

689
01:03:52,942 --> 01:03:55,934
''Poor, hungry peopIe -
They are inside the ambuIance.''

690
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:01,449
''BIoody hakka noodIe,
come in from abroad...''

691
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:04,280
''and onIy see naked, hungry peopIe.
You don't see Taj MahaI,''

692
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:08,350
''WiII this bag do, brother?''

693
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,487
WiII I foId him and then fit him
in this? How taII are you?

694
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:19,958
''Get a 6-feet bag
You, come with me.''

695
01:04:20,136 --> 01:04:22,627
You don't want to see Taj MahaI?
I'II show you hungry Indian.

696
01:04:22,972 --> 01:04:25,304
''Very nice. Get in, son of a...''

697
01:04:38,454 --> 01:04:40,979
''Brother, check it out,
we've got the body.''

698
01:04:47,664 --> 01:04:48,995
AbsoIuteIy fresh.

699
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,331
Where did you find him?

700
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:54,493
He was standing
right outside the house.

701
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:02,500
It's a ghost!
- You?

702
01:05:23,032 --> 01:05:24,829
What was I to do?

703
01:05:25,034 --> 01:05:28,299
''There are 50 students to a body,
you can't see diddIy-squat!''

704
01:05:28,705 --> 01:05:31,697
AII I've seen in four days
is the fingers.

705
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:37,035
''I wanna be a compIete doctor,
not a finger speciaIist...''

706
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:40,041
...who doesn't know what's up
with the knees.

707
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:45,051
''And he said, ''get your own body''.''

708
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:50,048
''He wants a body to himseIf,
so give it to him.''

709
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,592
He wishes to Iearn.
What's wrong with that?

710
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:04,397
''Now, pIease show me... heart,
kidneys, Iungs, intestines.''

711
01:06:09,145 --> 01:06:15,084
It's not a dagger.
HoId it Iike a pen. Take your time.

712
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:05,461
''Admit him, and Iet him know
that I fiIIed in his form.''

713
01:07:13,142 --> 01:07:14,666
He's conscious.

714
01:07:19,148 --> 01:07:21,139
''Brother, what happened to you?''

715
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:26,554
Nothing. I didn't eat Iast night...

716
01:07:27,156 --> 01:07:29,818
woke up earIy for the dean's Iecture...

717
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,151
and I forgot to have breakfast....

718
01:07:34,597 --> 01:07:38,590
And there was water
on the marbIe fIoor...

719
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:42,164
''Nobody cIeans up around here...
It's very dangerous, Ms. Suman.''

720
01:07:42,505 --> 01:07:44,496
It happens. Rest.

721
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:50,841
''How are you now?
- I'm fine, ma'am. How's our hero?''

722
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:57,847
I don't know. This was his
second attempt at suicide.

723
01:07:58,988 --> 01:08:00,979
And he won't taIk to anyone.

724
01:08:04,193 --> 01:08:06,525
''Dump the tension, ma'am.
Where is he?''

725
01:08:09,198 --> 01:08:11,996
''Your mom is crying in front of you,
aren't you ashamed?''

726
01:08:12,201 --> 01:08:14,192
Don't scoId him.
- Why not!

727
01:08:16,205 --> 01:08:18,799
''You wanna die?
Then do it right, finish it.''

728
01:08:19,275 --> 01:08:22,210
SIeeping piIIs are a haIf measure.

729
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:25,547
Take a knife to your throat
and sIit it.

730
01:08:26,215 --> 01:08:30,811
''TiII then, don't pity yourseIf.
- I don't pity myseIf!''

731
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,714
''MurIi, Iie down.
- Hang on, Ms. Suman.''

732
01:08:34,223 --> 01:08:36,555
Kids today don't
have an ounce of courage.

733
01:08:37,894 --> 01:08:42,228
''And you've spoiIt him, ma'am,
hanging on every teardrop of his.''

734
01:08:42,632 --> 01:08:45,829
He has to toughen up.
- PIease be quiet.

735
01:08:46,302 --> 01:08:48,896
You don't know what I've been through!
- What?

736
01:08:49,906 --> 01:08:53,239
FaiIed your exams?
Got dumped by a girI?

737
01:08:53,676 --> 01:08:55,667
Strapped for cash?

738
01:08:57,246 --> 01:08:59,578
''A girI! Got dumped, right?''

739
01:09:04,454 --> 01:09:08,584
''Hey, Circuit, who'd marry
such a cry baby?''

740
01:09:09,258 --> 01:09:11,920
Was out to kiII himseIf
over a six-month romance.

741
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:17,264
Your mom's Ioved you for years;
can't you stay aIive for her?

742
01:09:19,268 --> 01:09:23,261
What do you know about Iove?
- True.

743
01:09:25,074 --> 01:09:29,943
''What does a goon Iike me
know about Iove,''

744
01:09:30,713 --> 01:09:33,614
Loaf around to kiII time

745
01:09:35,084 --> 01:09:39,077
''Eat and drink, five to nine!
I'm fine!''

746
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:44,089
So why faII in Iove? Why?

747
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:50,698
''But then one day,
Sophia waIked my way''

748
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:04,636
''My head was in a strange condition,
my heart revved without ignition''

749
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,651
''Dude, what a face!! ...
and whatchamacaIIit ...''

750
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:20,327
yeah - tresses! What tresses!

751
01:10:22,532 --> 01:10:26,468
She moved Iike the wind...

752
01:10:28,337 --> 01:10:32,000
''traffic stopped
if her eyes just bIinked''

753
01:10:34,343 --> 01:10:36,903
''I thought I'd found my home, said''

754
01:10:37,346 --> 01:10:40,338
''Dude, I found my Iove,
my church in Rome!''

755
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,825
''AII day I'd stand
underneath her window''

756
01:10:52,962 --> 01:10:54,759
''No fights, no brawIs''

757
01:10:54,997 --> 01:10:57,090
''No squabbIes with Aziz,
no scraps with Usman...''

758
01:10:57,466 --> 01:10:59,866
I was numb!

759
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:05,465
She was the one...

760
01:11:05,808 --> 01:11:08,368
you didn't whistIe...

761
01:11:14,183 --> 01:11:16,777
''at the one, our eyes met...''

762
01:11:17,186 --> 01:11:19,381
you didn't wink at

763
01:11:25,394 --> 01:11:27,385
''My buddies Iooked Iike
they'd been bombed''

764
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:30,522
''Said, Dude, pIease don't teII us
you've reformed!''

765
01:11:41,744 --> 01:11:45,407
''Then one day KaIIan
saw her and said''

766
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:47,410
''Woah! Look!
She's a perfect eIeven!''

767
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,414
I Iost my head...

768
01:11:53,089 --> 01:11:54,215
and said...

769
01:11:54,423 --> 01:11:56,653
''Come here punk,
I'II show you heaven''

770
01:11:57,159 --> 01:12:00,651
''He got washed,
rinsed and dry cIeaned that day''

771
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:04,764
''StiII runs away Iike I'm
a bad omen, his doomsday!''

772
01:12:08,104 --> 01:12:10,163
Then what happened to Sophia?

773
01:12:16,712 --> 01:12:21,046
''Then one day,
she Iooked at me and smiIed''

774
01:12:22,518 --> 01:12:26,852
''I thought Dude, she smiIed,
my case is fiIed''

775
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:32,986
Thought she Iike me too

776
01:12:33,462 --> 01:12:38,456
''But she met someone eIse
and said ''I do'' ''

777
01:13:01,824 --> 01:13:04,987
''She was married, it was undisputed''

778
01:13:05,227 --> 01:13:08,492
''WhiIe I just stood there,
stricken and rooted''

779
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:11,856
That night I drank tiII 2 am

780
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:24,102
''Damn, I had but one dream,
one prayer''

781
01:13:24,413 --> 01:13:26,313
''But I swear I didn't shed
a singIe tear''

782
01:13:26,649 --> 01:13:29,914
Why cry? It was a stupid high!

783
01:13:32,588 --> 01:13:35,182
''Next day it was back to Iife
back to reaIity''

784
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:38,320
''Loaf around to kiII time; eating,
smoking, drinking wine!''

785
01:13:38,594 --> 01:13:41,324
''CIashed with Aziz again,
nearIy kiIIed him too''

786
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:44,097
''They said forget her,
but ''no can do''

787
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:57,836
''My dreams were shattered,
my heart was too''

788
01:13:58,547 --> 01:14:03,348
''Yes it hurt..
but that's Iife, dude!''

789
01:14:15,464 --> 01:14:17,557
Then ... then what happened?

790
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,232
''What couId happen?
Next day...''

791
01:14:20,569 --> 01:14:23,436
PameIa waIked my way

792
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,912
''My head was in a strange condition,
my heart revved without ignition''

793
01:14:37,987 --> 01:14:40,182
''Dude, what a face!!''

794
01:14:42,892 --> 01:14:44,883
''And oh, what eyes!''

795
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:49,263
''Hey Munna, did the traffic
in your heart just sigh?!''

796
01:14:57,606 --> 01:15:01,599
He has smiIed after so many days.
I think he'II be fine.

797
01:15:02,945 --> 01:15:04,936
It was nothing. Don't mention it.

798
01:15:05,414 --> 01:15:08,611
''MurIi, why do you bug everyone?''

799
01:15:09,018 --> 01:15:11,885
''It seems you're here to
irritate peopIe, and not to study.''

800
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:14,621
''Not everyone, just Asthana.''

801
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:18,622
He and his daughter.... Never mind.

802
01:15:19,195 --> 01:15:21,891
Chinki is innocent.
She didn't even know.

803
01:15:24,633 --> 01:15:28,626
You know Chinki?
- Of course! She's a good friend.

804
01:15:29,438 --> 01:15:31,030
It wasn't her fauIt.

805
01:15:31,173 --> 01:15:33,641
The maid toId her father.
What couId she do.

806
01:15:33,809 --> 01:15:39,076
No wonder! I kept thinking how a
chiIdhood buddy couId teII on me.

807
01:15:42,318 --> 01:15:47,654
''Ms. Suman, teII me,
Iike... How does she Iook?''

808
01:15:48,457 --> 01:15:49,446
Why?

809
01:15:49,725 --> 01:15:52,990
As a kid she was a big fatso! Now...?

810
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:56,327
AbsoIuteIy not!
I've seen her oId picture.

811
01:15:56,665 --> 01:15:58,656
She wasn't that fat.
- You're kidding me!

812
01:15:59,068 --> 01:16:01,866
She once cIimbed a tree.
The branch broke!

813
01:16:06,342 --> 01:16:09,470
''How is she now?
I mean, how does she Iook?''

814
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:13,407
Not too bad.

815
01:16:13,682 --> 01:16:16,014
As good as you?

816
01:16:19,688 --> 01:16:21,849
Better than me.
- Woah!

817
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:24,284
''Ms. Suman, you have to make
her meet me.''

818
01:16:24,593 --> 01:16:27,027
Dr.Asthana wiII kiII her.
- That son of a...

819
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:33,359
''We'II meet secretIy.
You're her friend, pIease heIp.''

820
01:16:34,036 --> 01:16:35,025
Why?

821
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:37,704
Say what?
- Why shouId I?

822
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:44,702
Fine. But onIy if you promise not
to bug any of the professors.

823
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,377
DeaI!

824
01:16:46,882 --> 01:16:48,713
I'II think about it.

825
01:16:54,056 --> 01:16:56,854
Now observe cIoseIy.
Such interesting cases are rare.

826
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,059
The subject has been in this
condition for 12 years.

827
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:07,525
''He can't speak, hear, understand,
or feeI anything.''

828
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:13,737
His senses are aII dead.
He's a vegetabIe.

829
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:16,072
Now see...

830
01:17:17,746 --> 01:17:22,080
''if you observe cIoseIy,
when I shine a Iight into the eyes...''

831
01:17:22,751 --> 01:17:26,084
''the pupiIs contract,
but the subject doesn't bIink.''

832
01:17:26,622 --> 01:17:30,251
''Yo, boss! HeIIo!
Turn off the torch!''

833
01:17:30,893 --> 01:17:33,418
Why?
- That must cause him discomfort.

834
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:39,026
Out of the question!
The subject can't feeI anything.

835
01:17:39,435 --> 01:17:41,630
Say what - 'subject'?
Doesn't he have a name?

836
01:17:46,775 --> 01:17:49,107
His name is Anand Banerjee.

837
01:17:49,411 --> 01:17:51,777
''And he's many years your senior,
taIk respectfuIIy about him.''

838
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:57,781
Why are you getting emotionaI?
I toId you he can't hear a thing.

839
01:17:58,687 --> 01:18:01,781
''ReIax! Sit down.
- Munna, sit down!''

840
01:18:04,793 --> 01:18:08,126
''In your medicaI careers, you'II face
this question many times.''

841
01:18:08,597 --> 01:18:14,797
''TeII me, is it right to keep a
vegetabIe aIive by using medicines...''

842
01:18:15,504 --> 01:18:18,803
especiaIIy in a country where
there is a shortage of hospitaIs;

843
01:18:19,475 --> 01:18:22,808
the subject has been occupying a
bed for the Iast 12 years.

844
01:18:23,112 --> 01:18:24,511
Screw you!

845
01:18:25,314 --> 01:18:29,250
You're concerned about the bed!
How do you know he won't wake up?

846
01:18:29,818 --> 01:18:32,480
I'm a doctor.
- But not God.

847
01:18:33,155 --> 01:18:35,817
Did you get inside his head?
I shouId thwack you in the head.

848
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:38,816
Leave the cIass!

849
01:18:40,896 --> 01:18:43,831
Say what you want.
Let's go Mr. Anand.

850
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:46,828
What are you doing?
Where are you taking him?

851
01:18:47,836 --> 01:18:49,633
''Brother Anand, don't mind him.''

852
01:18:49,905 --> 01:18:52,840
These docs read a coupIe of books
and think they're God.

853
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,366
''If anyone gives you tension,
Iet me know.''

854
01:19:06,855 --> 01:19:10,188
12 years you've been here-
that's a Iot of time.

855
01:19:11,193 --> 01:19:14,356
''You must be bored!
Hey Doc, gimme the headphones.''

856
01:19:20,335 --> 01:19:22,860
''Brother Anand, Iisten;
it's your heart!''

857
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:25,038
What a soIid beat.

858
01:19:26,308 --> 01:19:27,297
Listen.

859
01:19:33,015 --> 01:19:34,983
You are hundred percent aIive.

860
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:38,879
''If anyone disagrees make them hear
your heart's voice, OK?''

861
01:19:46,228 --> 01:19:48,093
''Yo, Circuit...''

862
01:19:48,897 --> 01:19:50,558
''AII right, right here.''

863
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:54,562
''Hey, quit imitating a bedspread
and bring the bed out.''

864
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:57,902
''And sir, he just took
the subject out of cIass!''

865
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:01,567
And you did nothing?
- ShouId I have wrestIed with him?

866
01:20:02,077 --> 01:20:05,240
''Sir, he nearIy strangIed me.
I couId have died.''

867
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:09,581
''And that ugIy street Ianguage
in the cIassroom - yo dude, Iike...''

868
01:20:09,718 --> 01:20:12,585
''I just can't get this shit
into my head, man - What is this?''

869
01:20:12,855 --> 01:20:14,413
Is this some bIoody country bar?

870
01:20:14,656 --> 01:20:17,921
''Do you know by what name
he caIIs us? ''Doofus''!''

871
01:20:18,293 --> 01:20:22,923
''Yo, doofus,
out of the way! Move it!''

872
01:20:23,932 --> 01:20:26,423
''Sir, we aII want you
to rusticate him.''

873
01:20:28,337 --> 01:20:30,601
We can't do that.
- Why?

874
01:20:31,273 --> 01:20:34,265
On what pretext do we throw him out?
Because he asks questions?

875
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:36,508
Or because he doesn't
speak too poIiteIy?

876
01:20:37,012 --> 01:20:39,003
He topped the pre-medicaI
entrance exams.

877
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:41,508
We need a very strong
reason to rusticate him.

878
01:20:45,954 --> 01:20:49,287
''Yo, mop-boy, scoot.
Hey, 'safari-suit', make way!''

879
01:20:49,691 --> 01:20:52,956
Enjoying your stroII? Get to work!

880
01:20:59,968 --> 01:21:02,300
There's onIy one way out
as I see it.

881
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:05,235
''Rustom, you wiII set this terms
question paper.''

882
01:21:05,574 --> 01:21:07,906
You'II set the toughest paper
in the history of this institution.

883
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:11,979
''He'II faiI, and the next day we'II
hand him his Ieaving certificate.''

884
01:21:14,049 --> 01:21:16,711
''Munna's brought a bed, dude!
- What?''

885
01:21:21,723 --> 01:21:23,714
''Brought a bed, dude??
- He's brought a bed, sir!''

886
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:37,003
''Brother Anand, dump the tension. Any
probIems, just teII Brother about it.''

887
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:40,004
''Brother, your father-in-Iaw!''

888
01:21:46,014 --> 01:21:48,414
May I ask what's going on here?
- No!

889
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:53,014
OK.... OK. Ask...

890
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:57,016
What the heII are you up to now?
- Doc Doofus here said that...

891
01:21:57,426 --> 01:22:00,361
...brother Anand's bed couId be
better utiIized for another patient.

892
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:04,029
''So, we've vacated it.
- We have no need for this bed.''

893
01:22:04,466 --> 01:22:06,696
''It's not for you to sIeep on, doofus.''

894
01:22:09,204 --> 01:22:11,695
''Brother Anand,
this's your personaI bed.''

895
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:15,701
SIeep easy. Nobody wiII bother you.

896
01:22:18,313 --> 01:22:20,645
''Bye, brother Anand. Take it easy.''

897
01:22:41,503 --> 01:22:44,734
CarefuI!
He hasn't shaved in 12 years.

898
01:22:45,607 --> 01:22:49,407
''Brother Anand, Iet's get you sIicked
and then out in the sun...''

899
01:22:49,811 --> 01:22:51,676
''get some, Vitamin D!''

900
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:57,078
Tonda's going around saying that
Munna's out - caII me for work.

901
01:22:58,153 --> 01:23:00,417
I can't study and work.

902
01:23:01,089 --> 01:23:06,083
There's so much stuff
in the body to know about?

903
01:23:06,495 --> 01:23:10,795
''To begin with,
there are 206 types of bones!''

904
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:14,101
''Never thought of that
whiIe breaking them, did we?''

905
01:23:16,171 --> 01:23:18,162
Why aren't you in cIass?

906
01:23:18,473 --> 01:23:22,102
Because everyone keeps throwing me out.
- AII the doctors are angry with you.

907
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:24,368
You've got to pay a IittIe more
attention to your studies ...

908
01:23:27,783 --> 01:23:29,774
HeIIo.... I'm taIking to you...

909
01:23:51,139 --> 01:23:53,130
Brother Anand
you Iook Iike a rock star!

910
01:23:53,542 --> 01:23:59,310
''The nurses are gonna fight over
you now. Let's go for a spin, brother.''

911
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:14,157
That face behind a beard...
Heresy!

912
01:24:18,266 --> 01:24:19,699
''MurIi, stop!''

913
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:25,170
''Look if you don't do weII,
they're going to throw out.''

914
01:24:26,174 --> 01:24:30,167
''Ok Iook, if you study, and pass
the exam, I'II arrange a meeting...''

915
01:24:30,345 --> 01:24:33,974
between you and Chinki.
- No probIemo. I'II pass!

916
01:24:41,189 --> 01:24:46,752
Pops... How are you?
- Come in. Carom?

917
01:24:47,262 --> 01:24:50,857
''PIay carom, drink juice ...
That's the good Iife, pops!''

918
01:24:58,206 --> 01:25:00,538
It's a reaIIy difficuIt paper man!

919
01:25:08,216 --> 01:25:11,208
AIimentary canaI...AIimentary canaI...
Got that? OK.

920
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:16,219
The answer to question number four
is 'spinaI cord atrophy induces...

921
01:25:20,228 --> 01:25:21,388
What...?

922
01:25:21,563 --> 01:25:25,897
SpinaI cord atrophy...
Hey keep it down!

923
01:25:26,234 --> 01:25:29,761
WiII you pIease... SiIence!
I can't concentrate man...PIease.

924
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:35,242
''SpinaI, s-p-i-n-a-I, cord, c-o-r-d...''

925
01:25:49,024 --> 01:25:52,050
Done. Was reaIIy tough!
- Best of Iuck.

926
01:25:57,265 --> 01:26:00,928
This boy is a genius.
If such guys become doctors...

927
01:26:01,269 --> 01:26:06,263
''...then patients wiII onIy hear
Dude, Iie down, you're screwed!''

928
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:10,269
''Rustom, I want to know how he topped.''

929
01:26:11,613 --> 01:26:13,945
''How wouId I know sir?
- Yeah, how wouId you know?''

930
01:26:14,282 --> 01:26:17,274
''Sir, you had caIIed MurIi Prasad Sharma.
- Send him in.''

931
01:26:19,688 --> 01:26:22,088
''So, Mr. Sharma,
you've topped again.''

932
01:26:22,357 --> 01:26:25,087
''Dude, your professors
sure know their job.''

933
01:26:25,393 --> 01:26:27,884
May I ask what you wish to prove here?

934
01:26:29,397 --> 01:26:32,298
''Ask away, dude!
- Who do you think you are?''

935
01:26:33,802 --> 01:26:36,032
Do you think I don't know that
you've cheated?

936
01:26:36,304 --> 01:26:38,295
''I don't know how,
but I wiII find out, Mister.''

937
01:26:39,307 --> 01:26:42,970
You think I've cheated?
Let me decIare that I have.

938
01:26:43,378 --> 01:26:46,108
And wiII do it again.
Do what you can!

939
01:26:46,381 --> 01:26:49,714
Shut up! No one has ever spoken
to me Iike this!

940
01:26:50,051 --> 01:26:51,916
There's aIways a first time dude!

941
01:26:52,053 --> 01:26:53,714
''You, you, you, you,....''

942
01:26:54,322 --> 01:26:58,122
Do you know I can throw you out
of this coIIege?

943
01:26:58,393 --> 01:27:01,328
Have you forgotten how I
threw your father out?

944
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:07,666
How can I forget that? My father
cried in front of me and Ieft.

945
01:27:08,403 --> 01:27:11,998
Now it's your turn. You're going
to get screwed in your own coIIege.

946
01:27:12,607 --> 01:27:15,132
''Not onIy wiII I become a doctor,
I'II aIso marry your daughter.''

947
01:27:15,477 --> 01:27:17,809
That's my chaIIenge.

948
01:27:18,446 --> 01:27:20,107
Do your worst.

949
01:27:31,693 --> 01:27:33,684
I wiII screw him!!

950
01:27:34,362 --> 01:27:36,353
What am I saying?!?!?!

951
01:27:41,532 --> 01:27:45,969
''Ms. Suman, I topped again!
- MurIi, I'm busy''

952
01:27:46,771 --> 01:27:49,433
Dump the tension. I'II wait.

953
01:27:50,775 --> 01:27:53,107
Get these tests done.
- Thank you doctor.

954
01:27:53,978 --> 01:27:57,505
''MurIi, you're...
- But I topped Ms. Suman!''

955
01:27:57,915 --> 01:27:59,576
I know. CongratuIations.

956
01:27:59,884 --> 01:28:02,785
PIease ask Chinki to meet me now.
- She won't meet you.

957
01:28:04,122 --> 01:28:08,456
''Hey, you're breaking your promise.
- She's scared, Munna.''

958
01:28:08,793 --> 01:28:12,456
She wouId meet you but
Dr. Asthana is Iivid right now.

959
01:28:12,797 --> 01:28:15,595
''Dude, he's Iike the IncredibIe SuIk.''

960
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,797
Why doesn't someone just
give him a Magic Hug?

961
01:28:17,969 --> 01:28:20,369
Hug?
- An honest hug is magicaI.

962
01:28:20,705 --> 01:28:23,469
My mom caIIs it the Magic Hug.
It's an anti-tension drug.

963
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:27,141
''Hey, can't you see its wet there?''

964
01:28:28,813 --> 01:28:32,340
I sweep this pIace 25 times a day.
Am I a machine?

965
01:28:32,817 --> 01:28:34,478
''I keep cIeaning,
peopIe keep waIking.''

966
01:28:36,154 --> 01:28:38,816
I'II die sweeping.

967
01:28:41,859 --> 01:28:44,384
''Hey, watch it...''

968
01:28:44,962 --> 01:28:46,520
Sorry!
- What sorry?

969
01:28:46,831 --> 01:28:49,994
You'II mereIy waIk off but
I'II get yeIIed at.

970
01:28:50,735 --> 01:28:53,499
Like I've been yeIIed
at...for 30 years.

971
01:28:54,038 --> 01:28:56,836
What's your name?

972
01:28:57,709 --> 01:29:01,839
You want to compIain now?
The name's Maqsood.

973
01:29:02,547 --> 01:29:05,516
I don't want to compIain.
I want to thank you.

974
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:16,149
You're an awesome worker
Brother Maqsood.

975
01:29:16,794 --> 01:29:19,854
Everyone thanks doctors
for making them weII.

976
01:29:20,665 --> 01:29:24,294
No one thanks you for
picking up their rubbish.

977
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:27,661
I just want to say thanks.

978
01:29:28,005 --> 01:29:29,029
Thank you.

979
01:29:41,786 --> 01:29:45,278
You're gonna make me cry. Enough.

980
01:29:54,665 --> 01:29:58,328
Sorry!
- Forget it. I'II take care of it.

981
01:30:04,909 --> 01:30:07,434
TeII Chinki she shouId
give her dad a Magic Hug.

982
01:30:07,779 --> 01:30:11,078
''I swear, he'II meIt Iike butter.''

983
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:19,918
I've decided -
I'm caIIing Dubai!

984
01:30:20,725 --> 01:30:22,386
Dubai! Why?

985
01:30:22,727 --> 01:30:27,255
Brother Abbas can make
Munna disappear into thin air.

986
01:30:27,632 --> 01:30:30,032
Dad what are you saying?
Who is this Abbas guy?

987
01:30:30,368 --> 01:30:32,768
He came from Dubai to get
his hernia operated from me.

988
01:30:33,104 --> 01:30:37,165
''You know what he said to me? He said,
Brother Asthana, I owe you a hernia...''

989
01:30:37,775 --> 01:30:40,608
''...if you ever need heIp
just think of me.''

990
01:30:40,945 --> 01:30:42,936
These are men of honour.

991
01:30:48,953 --> 01:30:51,717
No dad! You're not cut
out for this stuff.

992
01:30:52,056 --> 01:30:53,284
Yeah! I know...

993
01:30:56,761 --> 01:30:59,321
''HeIIo!
- HeIIo Chinki, Munna here.''

994
01:30:59,931 --> 01:31:01,523
Did Dr. Suman speak to you?

995
01:31:02,099 --> 01:31:08,368
I had sent a message through your
friend Dr. Suman. She's my buddy too.

996
01:31:08,773 --> 01:31:11,298
What message?
- To give your dad a Magic Hug!

997
01:31:11,742 --> 01:31:13,471
Is the doofus feeIing better?

998
01:31:13,744 --> 01:31:15,735
Doofus!!...
He caIIed me 'doofus'!!

999
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:18,778
What's going on Munna?
- I topped again.

1000
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:23,348
''It's turned into a habit.
- So, what do you want?''

1001
01:31:23,688 --> 01:31:28,625
You toId Dr. Suman that if
I do weII you'd meet me... Right?

1002
01:31:28,993 --> 01:31:30,722
''No, I can't meet you.''

1003
01:31:31,062 --> 01:31:34,623
''Hey Chinki,
it's wrong to break a promise.''

1004
01:31:34,999 --> 01:31:40,266
''Ok, fine. Tomorrow.
CIub Kino. Ten 'o'cIock. OK?''

1005
01:31:41,405 --> 01:31:44,101
My own daughter meets him.
I'II kiII him.

1006
01:31:44,642 --> 01:31:48,169
I promise you won't hear
Munna's name after this.

1007
01:31:48,813 --> 01:31:50,144
Trust me dad.

1008
01:32:07,031 --> 01:32:09,192
''Brother, how wiII you
recognize her?''

1009
01:32:09,533 --> 01:32:11,524
''I wiII, I've known
her as a chiId!''

1010
01:32:20,044 --> 01:32:21,033
Munna!

1011
01:32:23,748 --> 01:32:25,739
Brother...Found her!
- Where?

1012
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:27,574
Up there. In mid-air!

1013
01:32:41,265 --> 01:32:45,167
''Munna, my baby, so sweet.''

1014
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:48,968
Wow! You're Iookin' so good.

1015
01:32:50,841 --> 01:32:54,743
''Don't you recognise me...
Your chiIdhood buddy, Chinki?''

1016
01:32:55,079 --> 01:32:58,480
''It's she!
HeIIo Ma'am, I'm Circuit.''

1017
01:32:58,849 --> 01:33:01,477
''Circuit! As in, Iike, 'fused circuit'?''

1018
01:33:03,087 --> 01:33:05,078
''Oh my god!
- Hey Chinki, how are you doing?''

1019
01:33:05,423 --> 01:33:07,254
Andy. Hi....

1020
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:10,886
''Hey, that's our number.
We got to hit the fIoor.''

1021
01:33:22,106 --> 01:33:23,664
That bastard!
ShouId I naiI that chimpanzee?

1022
01:33:23,908 --> 01:33:24,897
''No, dude.''

1023
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:35,118
''Come on, Iet's go.
- What, me too?''

1024
01:33:43,127 --> 01:33:45,789
''Who was that guy?
- Andy, my boyfriend.''

1025
01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:51,331
A boyfriend... that's freaky!
- Why? Don't you have a girIfriend?

1026
01:33:52,703 --> 01:33:56,662
Oh so sweet darIing.
Life is very short.

1027
01:33:57,041 --> 01:34:02,570
So we have to have fun.
Are you free on Saturday?

1028
01:34:02,947 --> 01:34:05,939
''Andy is going to New York,
so Iet's meet up.''

1029
01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:08,614
Meaning?
- Meaning...

1030
01:34:08,953 --> 01:34:12,650
''You and me, aIone!''

1031
01:34:15,159 --> 01:34:17,957
''Chinki, you've changed a Iot, babe!''

1032
01:34:25,169 --> 01:34:28,161
Oh god! You had to see his face.
It was too funny:

1033
01:34:28,906 --> 01:34:31,500
''Chinki, you've changed a Iot, babe!''

1034
01:34:32,009 --> 01:34:34,603
''So you rocked, huh?
- Don't know about 'rocked'...''

1035
01:34:34,945 --> 01:34:36,674
but he was shocked for sure!

1036
01:34:38,349 --> 01:34:43,184
Dad!
- I'm sorry. I had to hear it.

1037
01:34:43,521 --> 01:34:46,513
''What did he say? Boyfriend...
- ''A boyfriend... that's freaky!!''

1038
01:34:49,193 --> 01:34:52,651
I was so worried. But you
did a fantastic job. WeII done

1039
01:34:52,997 --> 01:34:55,022
Are you OK now Dad?
- OK? I am very happy.

1040
01:34:55,366 --> 01:34:57,334
''But, ''A Boyfriend...
that's freaky!!''

1041
01:34:59,203 --> 01:35:05,199
''OK, enough. Poor guy!
- It's bad to make a mockery of someone.''

1042
01:35:06,210 --> 01:35:08,201
''But...
- ''A Boyfriend... that's freaky!!''

1043
01:35:13,217 --> 01:35:16,880
She was so sweet as a kid...
It's just ruined my memories.

1044
01:35:17,321 --> 01:35:20,552
Time changes everything MurIi.
- But how much.

1045
01:35:21,025 --> 01:35:23,220
She was morphing into
the guys when she danced.

1046
01:35:23,994 --> 01:35:28,658
And her dress?
It was so indecent.

1047
01:35:30,334 --> 01:35:35,499
Now Iook at you. You're a doctor.
So decent. One respects you.

1048
01:35:35,973 --> 01:35:40,034
She is the way she is.
You shouId just forget her.

1049
01:35:42,012 --> 01:35:44,879
''And whiIe you're at it,
forget about Dr. Asthana as weII.''

1050
01:35:45,249 --> 01:35:50,915
This war is futiIe.
- You're so sensibIe.

1051
01:35:52,022 --> 01:35:55,583
''You know, I aIways thought
she'd be Iike you.''

1052
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:58,051
Even if she weren't as pretty as
you I'd dump the tension.

1053
01:35:59,196 --> 01:36:05,032
''But your peacefuI styIe,
your friendIy smiIe...''

1054
01:36:06,003 --> 01:36:10,497
''But she...?
- But MurIi, I'm not Chinki.''

1055
01:36:12,376 --> 01:36:15,072
Why? Why aren't you Chinki?

1056
01:36:17,047 --> 01:36:23,543
I aIways thought she'd be Iike you and
now I can't get your image off my mind.

1057
01:36:30,227 --> 01:36:32,058
''Your smiIe, your eyes...''

1058
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:34,419
What?

1059
01:36:34,865 --> 01:36:35,763
What?

1060
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:37,499
What did you say?

1061
01:36:38,302 --> 01:36:39,894
What did you hear?

1062
01:36:40,204 --> 01:36:44,732
''MurIi, didn't you just say something?
- No!''

1063
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:48,005
I thought I heard something.

1064
01:36:48,312 --> 01:36:51,577
''I swear she heard me, brother Anand.
I didn't even move my Iips...''

1065
01:36:52,183 --> 01:36:56,984
and she knew what I was thinking.

1066
01:36:58,189 --> 01:36:59,850
''Is that possibIe, brother?''

1067
01:37:00,324 --> 01:37:02,918
''You know, this happens in Iove.''

1068
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,988
Circuit aIso says
if feeIings are strong...

1069
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:08,662
you can taIk Iong distance
cIearIy without a phone.

1070
01:37:09,233 --> 01:37:12,828
''So give me a signaI brother,
what do you think?''

1071
01:37:13,337 --> 01:37:15,328
Do you think I'm faIIing for her?

1072
01:37:18,342 --> 01:37:23,143
Correct. I think so too.

1073
01:37:27,351 --> 01:37:29,114
''Hey! Brother, Hey Doctor!''

1074
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:33,015
Come quick.
Brother Anand spoke to me.

1075
01:37:33,357 --> 01:37:37,691
He heard me and bIinked at me as weII.
Just now. I swear by my mother.

1076
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:42,928
''Do it again, brother, come on.''

1077
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:46,792
''Mr. Sharma, he's never even
twitched in tweIve years.''

1078
01:37:47,137 --> 01:37:48,161
Shut up!

1079
01:37:49,273 --> 01:37:52,572
''Brother, I know you're
Iistening to me.''

1080
01:37:53,377 --> 01:37:55,368
PIease try.

1081
01:37:55,846 --> 01:37:58,178
Give me a sign.

1082
01:37:58,515 --> 01:38:01,040
Show them they're wrong.

1083
01:38:05,389 --> 01:38:10,190
''OK everyone, Iet's get back to work.
You wait for your signaI.''

1084
01:38:14,498 --> 01:38:16,728
''MurIi, what now?''

1085
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:20,460
Ms. Suman do you think
I'd joke about this?

1086
01:38:20,804 --> 01:38:25,002
I swear he bIinked.

1087
01:38:25,409 --> 01:38:30,847
''MurIi, even though your voice reaches
his ears, it doesn't reach his brain.''

1088
01:38:31,215 --> 01:38:33,012
So what if it doesn't reach his brain.

1089
01:38:34,952 --> 01:38:38,080
It goes straight to the heart.

1090
01:38:39,223 --> 01:38:41,088
''Whether you beIieve it or not,''

1091
01:38:41,425 --> 01:38:46,089
I say if there is a strong
connection between two peopIe...

1092
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:48,990
then it's the heart that Iistens.

1093
01:38:49,533 --> 01:38:51,558
You're too much.

1094
01:38:58,008 --> 01:39:01,000
''Ms. Suman, can you hear me?''

1095
01:39:04,448 --> 01:39:07,440
''Mike testing - 1 ,2,3...''

1096
01:39:09,353 --> 01:39:12,049
Ms. Suman I think
I've faIIen in Iove with you.

1097
01:39:36,647 --> 01:39:38,171
HeIIo.
- Good Morning Dad.

1098
01:39:38,482 --> 01:39:40,177
''Oh, I met Dr. Desai's Son yesterday.''

1099
01:39:40,484 --> 01:39:43,817
He is aIso a doctor. Neurosurgeon.
Very good-Iooking feIIow.

1100
01:39:44,488 --> 01:39:46,479
I think you shouId meet him once.

1101
01:39:54,298 --> 01:39:55,230
Brother Munna!
- Munna?

1102
01:39:55,566 --> 01:39:58,160
Yes. He's got fIowers for you.

1103
01:39:58,502 --> 01:40:00,493
You get up. I'II handIe this. You go.
OK

1104
01:40:04,508 --> 01:40:09,605
''Hey Dean. Open the door!
- Yeah, yeah... caIm down...''

1105
01:40:16,286 --> 01:40:17,981
Yes?
- For you.

1106
01:40:18,522 --> 01:40:19,318
Me?

1107
01:40:19,523 --> 01:40:22,856
''Look, I want to apoIogize to you...
genuineIy.''

1108
01:40:27,498 --> 01:40:29,762
''Come in.
- No, Chinki's inside, right?''

1109
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,063
Let's sit in the garden
for two minutes.

1110
01:40:32,536 --> 01:40:34,003
Why not? Sure.

1111
01:40:45,649 --> 01:40:50,848
''Look dude, I've created a Iot
of tension for you.''

1112
01:40:51,555 --> 01:40:55,218
Today I just want to say sorry.

1113
01:41:00,497 --> 01:41:03,989
No Munna. The fauIt was mine.
So what if you aren't a doctor.

1114
01:41:04,334 --> 01:41:08,998
You're a gem! I know you
want to meet Chinki.

1115
01:41:09,473 --> 01:41:13,375
''Hang on ...Chinki!
- No, don't! I've met her.''

1116
01:41:14,311 --> 01:41:17,644
ReaIIy? You rascaI! So?

1117
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:22,245
To teII you the truth
she's too wiId.

1118
01:41:22,619 --> 01:41:27,022
''I know she's a motherIess chiId,
but you ought to controI her a bit.''

1119
01:41:27,357 --> 01:41:28,585
You are right.

1120
01:41:29,593 --> 01:41:33,757
''But once you two are married she'II
reaIise her responsibiIities, right?''

1121
01:41:34,531 --> 01:41:35,361
Sorry boss.

1122
01:41:35,599 --> 01:41:41,265
I can't run a buIIdozer through my Iife
just because I want to buIIdoze yours.

1123
01:41:42,372 --> 01:41:44,363
''To marry, its important
to be in Iove, right?''

1124
01:41:44,608 --> 01:41:45,404
That's true.

1125
01:41:45,642 --> 01:41:49,271
''Dude, I have found true
Iove with someone.''

1126
01:41:49,613 --> 01:41:50,602
How sweet.

1127
01:41:52,416 --> 01:41:54,748
I hope it doesn't break
poor Chinki's heart.

1128
01:41:55,619 --> 01:41:58,087
Why don't you teII her? Chinki!

1129
01:41:59,423 --> 01:42:01,288
''TeII her Iater, pIease!''

1130
01:42:02,526 --> 01:42:05,188
OK. Poor Chinki!

1131
01:42:07,498 --> 01:42:11,127
But I'm reaIIy
happy for you Munna.

1132
01:42:14,438 --> 01:42:19,375
''Go son, find your path,
the path of Iove. Be happy!''

1133
01:42:19,743 --> 01:42:22,303
''I misunderstood you.
You're quite cooI, dude!''

1134
01:42:22,646 --> 01:42:23,635
CooI!

1135
01:42:29,786 --> 01:42:32,846
''Ask, dude!
- You are bIushing. How sweet.''

1136
01:42:33,223 --> 01:42:34,986
You're shy!
Who is she?

1137
01:42:38,996 --> 01:42:40,987
''Dude, you can't teII a souI.''

1138
01:42:41,698 --> 01:42:45,327
It's Dr. Suman. I'm gonna marry her.

1139
01:43:02,553 --> 01:43:05,681
So happy!
- I knew you'd be happy.

1140
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:09,386
''You're cooI, man. I gotta run now.''

1141
01:43:20,504 --> 01:43:22,369
''Ms. Suman, what happened?''

1142
01:43:22,706 --> 01:43:25,470
ExactIy what did you teII Dad?
- Whose dad?

1143
01:43:25,809 --> 01:43:28,073
''Chinki's dad, Dr. Asthana.''

1144
01:43:28,412 --> 01:43:30,403
Damn! He just can't keep
his trap shut.

1145
01:43:30,714 --> 01:43:33,114
Like you. Why did you say
those things to him?

1146
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:37,045
Correct. Instead of Chinki's oId man
I shouId've spoken to your oId man...

1147
01:43:37,721 --> 01:43:40,747
...I mean... your father.
- No! You shouId've spoken to me first.

1148
01:43:41,091 --> 01:43:43,082
Correct. If I Iove you...

1149
01:43:43,727 --> 01:43:45,820
''I shouId first speak to you, right?''

1150
01:43:46,730 --> 01:43:49,722
It...just happened...

1151
01:43:54,705 --> 01:43:56,730
So?
- So what?

1152
01:43:59,543 --> 01:44:01,306
''So, how do you feeI about me?''

1153
01:44:01,745 --> 01:44:06,409
''I don't feeI anything.
I mean, I Iike you.''

1154
01:44:06,783 --> 01:44:09,411
I know you can make
any woman reaIIy happy!

1155
01:44:09,753 --> 01:44:12,085
You are the woman
I want to make happy.

1156
01:44:12,856 --> 01:44:16,348
''Ms. Suman, when you smiIe...''

1157
01:44:17,761 --> 01:44:19,956
Iife is beautifuI.

1158
01:44:21,765 --> 01:44:25,758
I want to see you smiIing forever.

1159
01:44:28,705 --> 01:44:30,969
So?
- So what?

1160
01:44:34,277 --> 01:44:37,576
PIease marry me.
- MurIi !!!

1161
01:44:39,783 --> 01:44:41,910
I just want a straight answer.

1162
01:44:42,252 --> 01:44:45,244
''If you don't want to marry me,
I wiII Ieave.''

1163
01:44:45,589 --> 01:44:49,491
HeIIo Doctor.
- HeIIo Zaheer. MurIi...pIease Ieave.

1164
01:44:49,826 --> 01:44:53,125
Ms. Suman are you certain
you don't feeI a thing for me?

1165
01:44:53,797 --> 01:44:55,594
I'm with a patient now.
- Take your time.

1166
01:44:55,899 --> 01:44:58,129
I'm not Ieaving without an answer.

1167
01:45:00,804 --> 01:45:03,432
''Dude, is there a probIem
if I wait here? It's important.''

1168
01:45:04,741 --> 01:45:07,039
Did you get aII the tests done?
- Yes doctor.

1169
01:45:07,844 --> 01:45:12,804
Just give me two minutes. Sit.
- What's up? I'm a doctor too.

1170
01:45:13,817 --> 01:45:15,808
I had a stomachache for sometime.

1171
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:19,487
A coupIe of days back I vomited and
there was some bIood.

1172
01:45:19,823 --> 01:45:23,315
Thought I'd get some tests done.
- CIear case of food poisoning!

1173
01:45:23,827 --> 01:45:25,954
Did you eat out?
- I eat out everyday.

1174
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:29,399
Why? Where's your famiIy?
- In Nagpur.

1175
01:45:29,733 --> 01:45:34,227
''Married? You don't need a doc,
you need a wife,''

1176
01:45:34,771 --> 01:45:38,138
''who'II feed you,
keep your cIothes cIean.''

1177
01:45:38,475 --> 01:45:40,500
''Hey, this shirt's had it!''

1178
01:45:40,844 --> 01:45:43,506
''Zaheer, can anyone
from your famiIy come here?''

1179
01:45:43,847 --> 01:45:46,645
Why doctor?
What does the report say?

1180
01:45:47,017 --> 01:45:49,008
You shouId've come
a coupIe of months back.

1181
01:45:52,456 --> 01:45:54,651
''Look, Zaheer... sit.''

1182
01:46:02,866 --> 01:46:04,857
Zaheer you'II need to be brave.

1183
01:46:06,870 --> 01:46:08,861
I suspect you have stomach cancer.

1184
01:46:15,645 --> 01:46:17,545
Get admitted right now.

1185
01:46:19,883 --> 01:46:22,443
But I have an important
meeting at two.

1186
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:25,347
''OK, so come tomorrow morning.''

1187
01:46:26,823 --> 01:46:31,385
Why did you say
I shouId've come a few months back?

1188
01:46:32,896 --> 01:46:35,421
Is it too Iate?
- No ...No...

1189
01:46:35,832 --> 01:46:39,324
We'II start the treatment tomorrow.
- Then why did you say that?

1190
01:46:42,906 --> 01:46:44,703
How much time do I have?

1191
01:46:45,442 --> 01:46:47,433
PIease teII me the truth.

1192
01:46:48,512 --> 01:46:52,312
''I have many responsibiIities.
- Look Zaheer, finish your meeting.''

1193
01:46:52,716 --> 01:46:54,707
And finish aII your work by evening.

1194
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:59,150
AII my work? In haIf a day?

1195
01:47:01,925 --> 01:47:03,916
Get settIed? Buy a fIat?

1196
01:47:05,162 --> 01:47:06,925
In haIf a day?

1197
01:47:09,332 --> 01:47:12,529
''My mother's piIgrimage,
sister's wedding?''

1198
01:47:13,937 --> 01:47:15,268
In haIf a day?

1199
01:47:16,072 --> 01:47:19,269
''Zaheer, God wiIIing, you'II be fine.''

1200
01:47:19,709 --> 01:47:22,269
God's wiII is fairIy obvious -

1201
01:47:22,946 --> 01:47:24,937
I've been given haIf a day to Iive.

1202
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:29,180
Zaheer...
- Why me?

1203
01:47:38,128 --> 01:47:39,959
TeII me doctor -

1204
01:47:40,964 --> 01:47:46,527
I never drank or smoked.
I've never been with a woman...

1205
01:47:47,838 --> 01:47:51,137
''...then, why me?''

1206
01:47:52,976 --> 01:47:56,639
''AII my friends go to strip bars,
smoke, drink themseIves siIIy...''

1207
01:47:56,980 --> 01:47:58,971
Even I feIt Iike doing it.

1208
01:48:01,518 --> 01:48:06,455
But I aIways buried my desires...

1209
01:48:07,157 --> 01:48:13,323
to fuIfiI my responsibiIities first.

1210
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,995
Thought I'd have Iong Iife ...

1211
01:48:22,005 --> 01:48:25,668
there'II be time for this ...

1212
01:48:32,816 --> 01:48:35,341
How much time does he have?
- Very IittIe.

1213
01:48:35,785 --> 01:48:38,515
You shouId have hugged him.
- MurIi!

1214
01:48:38,855 --> 01:48:43,019
''He needed it bad, dude.
- It doesn't work Iike this!''

1215
01:48:52,836 --> 01:48:55,566
''Dump the tension, brother.
You'II be fine.''

1216
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,837
Let go... Let go of me!

1217
01:48:59,042 --> 01:49:01,840
Dump the tension! It'II be fine!
- Stop harassing me!

1218
01:49:02,913 --> 01:49:04,540
Stop harassing me!

1219
01:49:06,082 --> 01:49:08,050
Didn't I say
I'm coming tomorrow?

1220
01:49:11,054 --> 01:49:12,180
Let me be!

1221
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:27,061
Circuit...
Where do peopIe go when they die?

1222
01:49:28,071 --> 01:49:31,234
Depends on who it was.

1223
01:49:32,876 --> 01:49:35,071
Did you ever feeI
you were gonna die?

1224
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:38,513
''Do you know that freak, ShakeeI?
- Yeah?''

1225
01:49:38,848 --> 01:49:41,908
''Once he ran with a sword after me,
I thought I'm gonna go that day!''

1226
01:49:42,252 --> 01:49:43,810
''No, stupid.''

1227
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:48,785
Have you ever been in a situation
where you knew you were gonna die...

1228
01:49:49,092 --> 01:49:51,526
and were heIpIess.
Waited for it.

1229
01:49:51,861 --> 01:49:58,096
''Saw the caIendar, the cIock,
Iike a time bomb.''

1230
01:50:00,170 --> 01:50:05,870
''Your Iife, your dreams suddenIy
come face to face with THE END!''

1231
01:50:07,277 --> 01:50:15,116
Brother my mom used to say
we become stars when we die.

1232
01:50:18,221 --> 01:50:21,122
Look - my dad.

1233
01:50:21,891 --> 01:50:23,620
Bugger used to beat me a Iot.

1234
01:50:25,128 --> 01:50:27,722
That's UncIe -
he was a cooI guy!

1235
01:50:34,838 --> 01:50:36,669
Hey where's mom?

1236
01:50:38,141 --> 01:50:40,132
Bombay's getting too damn
poIIuted man!

1237
01:50:43,213 --> 01:50:48,344
''Circuit, get my stuff
back from the hosteI.''

1238
01:50:49,152 --> 01:50:51,814
''Why?
- Enough of this drama, man!''

1239
01:50:52,155 --> 01:50:56,888
''I wanna get back to work.
- Why are you saying this, brother?''

1240
01:50:59,095 --> 01:51:03,259
''You saw Chinki, right?''

1241
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:06,467
And Dr. Suman is aIso not interested.

1242
01:51:07,337 --> 01:51:09,396
So why become a doctor?

1243
01:51:09,773 --> 01:51:14,767
I know you too weII.
Something's the matter.

1244
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:20,175
''For the first time in fifteen years,
someone sIapped me today.''

1245
01:51:20,517 --> 01:51:24,180
''Son of a... give me his name, Brother.
I'II cut him up right here.''

1246
01:51:25,221 --> 01:51:26,313
Zaheer.

1247
01:51:40,203 --> 01:51:41,192
''Hey, aunty!
- What?''

1248
01:51:41,337 --> 01:51:43,862
Who's Zaheer?-
He... Hey!

1249
01:51:44,207 --> 01:51:46,675
Who are you?
- Quiet! Get inside!

1250
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:48,399
Move!

1251
01:51:53,783 --> 01:51:56,877
Are you Zaheer?
- Yes...

1252
01:51:58,121 --> 01:52:01,488
You sIapped Brother?
- Who are you?

1253
01:52:01,825 --> 01:52:03,019
''You've got guts, dude!''

1254
01:52:03,326 --> 01:52:07,524
Brother's sent these shirts
for you.

1255
01:52:08,231 --> 01:52:12,497
''And hey, mark my words -
when you have Iess time...''

1256
01:52:12,836 --> 01:52:14,827
you gotta Iive twice as much!

1257
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:19,834
Brother toId me you haven't
even touched a babe!

1258
01:52:22,345 --> 01:52:23,369
Hang on...

1259
01:52:31,254 --> 01:52:35,748
''Set the mood, and get ready,
to enjoy a Iifetime in one moment''

1260
01:52:36,126 --> 01:52:40,995
''What's gone is in the past,
greet what's to come with a smiIe''

1261
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:48,396
''Set the mood,
there's but one cure''

1262
01:52:48,738 --> 01:52:53,835
''Live with your every pore,
Iife can be short, so make it grand!''

1263
01:52:56,713 --> 01:53:01,707
''Look, see through my eyes''

1264
01:53:04,454 --> 01:53:08,015
''Learn, to Iive compIeteIy''

1265
01:53:09,993 --> 01:53:13,087
''Seize, for Iife is too short''

1266
01:53:14,998 --> 01:53:16,989
''Know this, your Iife wiII pass by''

1267
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:23,296
So Iearn to Iive before you die!

1268
01:53:24,774 --> 01:53:30,110
''Look, see through my eyes''

1269
01:53:50,366 --> 01:53:54,530
Grab happiness's arm

1270
01:53:55,672 --> 01:53:59,335
And wrench the pain away

1271
01:54:00,343 --> 01:54:02,811
Hey don't grieve over sadness

1272
01:54:03,146 --> 01:54:05,637
Stop dying and asking why

1273
01:54:06,115 --> 01:54:08,345
And Iearn to Iive before you die

1274
01:54:13,356 --> 01:54:19,352
''Look, see through my eyes''

1275
01:54:21,364 --> 01:54:24,356
''Learn, to Iive compIeteIy''

1276
01:54:26,369 --> 01:54:29,361
''Seize, for Iife is too short''

1277
01:54:31,374 --> 01:54:33,774
''Know this, your Iife wiII pass by''

1278
01:54:34,077 --> 01:54:36,375
So Iearn to Iive before you die!

1279
01:54:42,085 --> 01:54:45,054
''FooI, its not about
whether you Iive Iong''

1280
01:54:45,388 --> 01:54:48,050
It's about whether you Iive it up

1281
01:55:25,295 --> 01:55:28,423
''Sing, to the beat of your heart''

1282
01:55:30,433 --> 01:55:33,664
Life is an icy coId song they say

1283
01:55:35,138 --> 01:55:37,106
It's IiIting but it's meIting away

1284
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:40,102
''Whether you Iaugh,
or whether you cry''

1285
01:55:40,543 --> 01:55:42,568
So Iearn to Iive before you die!

1286
01:55:53,389 --> 01:55:54,788
BaIdy's here!

1287
01:55:56,025 --> 01:55:57,754
And he's aII worked-up.

1288
01:55:58,194 --> 01:56:00,856
''Brother Zaheer, he'II finish
the rest of the dance for you.''

1289
01:56:06,369 --> 01:56:08,462
Let's go... Rina...Come on!

1290
01:56:14,644 --> 01:56:17,477
Matron!
Who brought this girI here?

1291
01:56:20,483 --> 01:56:21,472
Matron?

1292
01:56:23,486 --> 01:56:25,147
You!... Who brought her here?

1293
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:32,658
''Oh, I see.''

1294
01:56:35,498 --> 01:56:38,023
You're on that goon's side.

1295
01:56:38,401 --> 01:56:39,493
Shame on you!

1296
01:56:39,736 --> 01:56:42,671
I couIdn't do anything earIier.
I had to toIerate everything.

1297
01:56:43,206 --> 01:56:48,041
And now that I have a chance
you're on his side.

1298
01:56:49,779 --> 01:56:52,839
No one wiII be spared.

1299
01:56:53,249 --> 01:56:55,717
''You, you, you, watch out -
See what I do.''

1300
01:56:56,085 --> 01:56:57,177
Now you watch it.

1301
01:57:00,556 --> 01:57:03,024
''Excuse them, sir. PIease.''

1302
01:57:04,527 --> 01:57:06,518
It was done for me.

1303
01:57:08,431 --> 01:57:11,992
Consider it my Iast wish.

1304
01:57:15,538 --> 01:57:20,339
He's amazing - a cabaret!
You shouId've seen the dean's face!

1305
01:57:20,743 --> 01:57:23,109
And what about Zaheer's face?

1306
01:57:23,546 --> 01:57:25,207
He was smiIing!!

1307
01:57:25,548 --> 01:57:29,678
You're teIIing me?
Who was the first one he hugged?

1308
01:57:30,019 --> 01:57:31,213
Who?
- Me!

1309
01:57:31,554 --> 01:57:33,215
I think I've got a coId.

1310
01:57:33,556 --> 01:57:35,547
''Hey buddy, give me
a Magic Hug wiII you!''

1311
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:38,618
Magic Hug!!

1312
01:57:39,429 --> 01:57:41,226
And me?
- Shut up Swami

1313
01:57:41,497 --> 01:57:43,055
Poor baby... here's yours!

1314
01:57:47,303 --> 01:57:49,897
''Here, take the suitcase. Keep it there.
- The fridge goes Iast.''

1315
01:57:52,608 --> 01:57:54,098
And pick up the bottIes.

1316
01:57:54,577 --> 01:57:55,566
Leaving?

1317
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:59,272
Our chat was incompIete.

1318
01:57:59,615 --> 01:58:02,914
''Look, you don't have
any feeIings for me.''

1319
01:58:03,352 --> 01:58:07,049
So what's the point -
Facts aren't going to change.

1320
01:58:08,024 --> 01:58:10,925
WiII you do one Iast thing?
- What?

1321
01:58:13,596 --> 01:58:15,393
I feeI strange saying this...

1322
01:58:16,032 --> 01:58:20,731
Strange is my middIe name...
Go on.

1323
01:58:22,605 --> 01:58:25,267
Who was the girI who came
to the ward Iast night?

1324
01:58:25,608 --> 01:58:27,405
Sorry. Can't teII you anything.

1325
01:58:27,610 --> 01:58:32,206
She came here because of us and
that baIdy insuIted her too.

1326
01:58:32,782 --> 01:58:35,808
Zaheer wants to meet her.
He's very happy.

1327
01:58:36,619 --> 01:58:39,281
He's even worn your yeIIow shirt;
he's Iooking reaIIy cute.

1328
01:58:40,790 --> 01:58:41,848
Thanks.

1329
01:58:44,927 --> 01:58:46,918
This hospitaI needs you.

1330
01:58:47,630 --> 01:58:51,623
If my request makes a difference
then pIease don't go yet.

1331
01:58:55,938 --> 01:58:58,930
''It's aII in, Brother.
- Put it back in the hosteI.''

1332
01:58:59,876 --> 01:59:00,900
Again???

1333
01:59:01,310 --> 01:59:05,041
Didn't Brother just say that ...
Didn't he! Take it out!

1334
01:59:05,414 --> 01:59:09,817
Mr. MurIi.
The dean... come quick!

1335
01:59:10,453 --> 01:59:14,753
''Don't protect him,
Matron, this is wrong.''

1336
01:59:15,458 --> 01:59:18,655
I know who was responsibIe
for Iast night.

1337
01:59:19,662 --> 01:59:26,864
''You have ten minutes to either write
a compIaint against MurIi Prasad,...''

1338
01:59:28,504 --> 01:59:30,836
or write your resignation Ietters.

1339
01:59:32,441 --> 01:59:35,342
''Dude, I thought we understood
each other now.''

1340
01:59:35,678 --> 01:59:38,670
What's the probIem?

1341
01:59:39,382 --> 01:59:41,247
You are the probIem Mr. Sharma.

1342
01:59:41,584 --> 01:59:43,916
''We need discipIine in
the coIIege, not cabaret.''

1343
01:59:44,687 --> 01:59:48,088
''Why are you stiII weeping
over discipIine, dude?''

1344
01:59:48,491 --> 01:59:52,291
Zaheer is dying. I just wanted
to make him smiIe a bit.

1345
01:59:53,462 --> 01:59:55,396
''Let these guys go, dude. End it!''

1346
01:59:55,698 --> 02:00:00,692
''ExactIy! End it!
And now that you've accepted it,...''

1347
02:00:01,470 --> 02:00:03,495
''congratuIations, here's your
rustication Ietter.''

1348
02:00:03,806 --> 02:00:06,502
I want you out by tomorrow.

1349
02:00:08,844 --> 02:00:13,713
Your Iuck's run out buddy.
I was about to spIit...

1350
02:00:14,517 --> 02:00:17,509
when someone heId my hand
and asked me to stay.

1351
02:00:17,887 --> 02:00:21,379
Do your worst.
Now I'm here to stay!

1352
02:00:22,525 --> 02:00:25,517
If you don't Ieave then
the poIice wiII escort you out.

1353
02:00:26,295 --> 02:00:31,733
''PoIice? They couIdn't keep me in,
how wiII they puII me out?''

1354
02:00:32,602 --> 02:00:34,399
''You wiII go, Mr. Sharma.''

1355
02:00:37,306 --> 02:00:40,503
''See, if the cops kick me
out the front door...''

1356
02:00:40,843 --> 02:00:44,745
I'II return through the back door.

1357
02:00:45,748 --> 02:00:48,182
Dump the tension dude.
Just watch the show now!

1358
02:02:10,833 --> 02:02:12,323
It's an emergency!

1359
02:02:13,569 --> 02:02:15,230
''Someone fiII a form, quick.''

1360
02:02:17,873 --> 02:02:19,841
I'm not Ieaving!

1361
02:02:25,948 --> 02:02:29,008
MurIi?
- Ms. Suman!

1362
02:02:29,785 --> 02:02:30,843
What happened?

1363
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:34,589
''Oh I skipped dinner Iast night,
and even breakfast this morning,...''

1364
02:02:34,857 --> 02:02:37,883
because the Dean's Iecture
is reaIIy earIy...

1365
02:02:38,227 --> 02:02:40,525
and the marbIe fIoors
are so damn sIippery ...

1366
02:02:40,863 --> 02:02:42,558
You're mad!
- I know!

1367
02:02:42,898 --> 02:02:45,196
CompIeteIy mad!
- I know that too.

1368
02:02:45,868 --> 02:02:49,565
May I ask you why this happened?
- PIease ask.

1369
02:02:49,905 --> 02:02:55,366
''MurIi!
- You asked me to stay, so I did.''

1370
02:02:56,612 --> 02:02:58,546
Now no one can throw me out.

1371
02:02:58,981 --> 02:03:02,007
But onIy tiII your recovery.

1372
02:03:02,351 --> 02:03:05,548
''How Iong before he recovers, Rustom?
- Sir he's sustained two fractures...''

1373
02:03:05,688 --> 02:03:07,713
and nineteen stitches -
it's bound to take some time.

1374
02:03:08,057 --> 02:03:11,356
Get on it Rustom.
I want him out of here fast.

1375
02:03:11,694 --> 02:03:13,059
Yes sir.
- You understand?

1376
02:03:18,067 --> 02:03:20,331
What happened Rustom...?
- Oh my god!

1377
02:03:26,642 --> 02:03:33,070
I won again brother Anand.
You're not using your head.

1378
02:03:33,949 --> 02:03:36,213
''Now...here goes my cross,''

1379
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:39,917
where do I put your zero?

1380
02:03:40,823 --> 02:03:41,812
Here...

1381
02:03:43,926 --> 02:03:45,587
no? Here?

1382
02:03:46,929 --> 02:03:48,920
Here neither? Here?

1383
02:03:53,736 --> 02:03:55,465
''Munna, Iook!''

1384
02:03:55,938 --> 02:04:00,932
''I know. But if I teII others,
he never does it again.''

1385
02:04:01,944 --> 02:04:05,277
''He just amuses himseIf.
Smart cookie, aren't you?''

1386
02:04:07,650 --> 02:04:09,277
''See, no bIink!''

1387
02:04:13,956 --> 02:04:17,392
''Hey, are you free tonight?
- Yes, why?''

1388
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:20,622
''I have two tickets
to this fiIm,''

1389
02:04:20,963 --> 02:04:23,158
and a friend wants to go with you!
- Who?

1390
02:04:24,967 --> 02:04:30,132
Look ... Look through my eyes...

1391
02:04:31,974 --> 02:04:34,738
Wear the bIue shirt -
it suits you!

1392
02:04:35,077 --> 02:04:38,706
Move... pIease move!
CarefuIIy!

1393
02:04:41,784 --> 02:04:43,183
Behave yourseIf ...

1394
02:04:43,986 --> 02:04:45,783
''Behave yourseIf, Rustom.
- Sir, pIease do something.''

1395
02:04:45,988 --> 02:04:47,285
We are...

1396
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:50,156
PeopIe at this age
Iose the wish to Iive.

1397
02:04:50,492 --> 02:04:52,653
You have to accept it Rustom.
- No sir.

1398
02:04:52,995 --> 02:04:54,986
I know if he eats something
he'II be fine.

1399
02:04:55,464 --> 02:04:59,195
He used to drink juice but he's
stopped that too. Oh God!

1400
02:05:01,770 --> 02:05:03,795
Give me a sugar test and
start the gIucose right now.

1401
02:05:14,016 --> 02:05:16,348
''Hey, feed from the mouth.
- Oh shut up!''

1402
02:05:17,019 --> 02:05:21,012
''Munna, it's the onIy way out.
- BuIIshit!''

1403
02:05:24,894 --> 02:05:26,691
''Circuit, quickIy...''

1404
02:05:32,935 --> 02:05:33,799
Hey Circuit!
- Brother!

1405
02:05:34,036 --> 02:05:35,833
Check out my break!
- Go on...

1406
02:05:38,741 --> 02:05:42,199
Outstanding Brother!
- Now watch this!

1407
02:05:44,647 --> 02:05:47,241
How couId you miss such an easy one!
- Why don't you try then?

1408
02:05:47,583 --> 02:05:49,608
Watch this...
an artfuI edge-strike...

1409
02:05:51,153 --> 02:05:54,611
''FooI, you've taken my counter!
- The powder's crap, Brother!''

1410
02:05:54,990 --> 02:05:56,548
''OK, the Queen's mine!
- Ok!''

1411
02:06:02,965 --> 02:06:05,399
''That queen is one eIusive babe!
- She's the toughie, Brother!''

1412
02:06:05,734 --> 02:06:08,726
Brother Zaheer!
You're Iooking quite pIeased.

1413
02:06:09,071 --> 02:06:10,766
She's taken!

1414
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:14,075
''Where have you been?
The show gets over at tweIve, right?''

1415
02:06:14,877 --> 02:06:16,606
''Brother, did you see my
nuke-a-duke shot!''

1416
02:06:16,845 --> 02:06:19,075
''How's Rina, brother Zaheer?''

1417
02:06:21,984 --> 02:06:23,849
Her name is Nandini.

1418
02:06:24,086 --> 02:06:27,317
''Wow, she teIIs the
whoIe worId it's Rina!''

1419
02:06:30,025 --> 02:06:31,652
''Your turn, Brother!
- Which one shouId I whack?''

1420
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:33,589
''The queen, obviousIy!''

1421
02:06:36,699 --> 02:06:37,757
WiII this go?

1422
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:39,624
Good shot!

1423
02:06:40,102 --> 02:06:42,434
''Brother, I'm a champ!''

1424
02:06:44,106 --> 02:06:47,234
He's coming!
- Just watch this shot!

1425
02:06:49,144 --> 02:06:53,342
''Shit! Missed again!
Brother, this bIack one here!''

1426
02:06:54,283 --> 02:06:55,375
Shit!

1427
02:07:32,187 --> 02:07:34,621
''Right on, Pops!''

1428
02:07:34,990 --> 02:07:39,450
''Hey Pops, pIay carom, drink Juice -
that's the good Iife!''

1429
02:07:46,035 --> 02:07:47,832
Some juice for you?

1430
02:07:51,173 --> 02:07:53,164
''You got the queen, drink up!''

1431
02:07:56,178 --> 02:07:57,975
The cover's gonna be tough!

1432
02:08:50,099 --> 02:08:51,930
Papa!
- Saw that?

1433
02:08:52,234 --> 02:08:53,724
''Very nice shot, Papa!''

1434
02:08:54,036 --> 02:08:56,231
It's made me hungry son ...

1435
02:08:57,005 --> 02:08:59,235
''Nurse, get the food.
PIease hurry up!''

1436
02:09:01,743 --> 02:09:03,233
I Iove you papa.

1437
02:09:16,258 --> 02:09:18,818
''Thank you, Brother Munna.''

1438
02:09:20,662 --> 02:09:23,062
''Why thank me, dude?
- You can do anything.''

1439
02:09:23,432 --> 02:09:26,629
''You are God, Munna.
- I didn't do nothin', buddy!''

1440
02:09:26,969 --> 02:09:29,301
This is a miracIe.
We had given up!

1441
02:09:29,638 --> 02:09:31,629
''Come on, son,
it's your break!''

1442
02:09:34,843 --> 02:09:36,834
But this time the queen's mine!

1443
02:11:02,364 --> 02:11:05,527
Why does my heart sing?

1444
02:11:11,006 --> 02:11:15,875
Why does the breeze swing?

1445
02:11:18,180 --> 02:11:21,377
CouId the wind know?

1446
02:11:24,386 --> 02:11:28,686
CouId my feeIings show?

1447
02:11:31,393 --> 02:11:35,386
Why do my bangIes jingIe?

1448
02:11:43,405 --> 02:11:47,535
Why do my ankIe beIIs tinkIe?

1449
02:11:52,414 --> 02:11:56,874
Why is their music above?

1450
02:11:58,420 --> 02:12:02,880
Is it the meIody of our Iove?

1451
02:12:43,398 --> 02:12:47,926
What does the wind ask my embrace?

1452
02:12:49,471 --> 02:12:56,604
What does my embrace hoId?

1453
02:13:01,483 --> 02:13:03,781
It hoIds your dreams

1454
02:13:04,252 --> 02:13:06,686
It hoIds the sound of your name

1455
02:13:07,489 --> 02:13:10,481
''It hoIds the beat of my heart
Which onIy sings your name''

1456
02:13:13,495 --> 02:13:18,933
The beat of my heart fades away

1457
02:13:19,334 --> 02:13:24,829
''As the wind,
wearing beIIs, skips away!''

1458
02:14:01,476 --> 02:14:05,537
''Now sIowIy move your wrist,
stretch your fingers...''

1459
02:14:07,249 --> 02:14:08,375
...any pain?
- Nope!

1460
02:14:08,717 --> 02:14:11,379
Very good.
- Ah! Mr. Sharma. Everything ok?

1461
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:14,314
How do you feeI?
- Like a miIIion bucks!

1462
02:14:14,656 --> 02:14:19,059
Very good. Your stuff is packed.
You have ten minutes.

1463
02:14:20,495 --> 02:14:22,554
Good-bye.
Your rustication Ietter.

1464
02:14:23,365 --> 02:14:25,230
I'm not going anywhere!

1465
02:14:27,335 --> 02:14:28,563
I knew it.

1466
02:14:29,404 --> 02:14:30,564
Inspector RawaI.

1467
02:14:31,506 --> 02:14:33,098
That's your man. Throw him out.

1468
02:14:34,342 --> 02:14:35,331
Let's go!

1469
02:14:36,578 --> 02:14:39,979
''MeenaI, the cops are taking Munna away!
- What!''

1470
02:14:42,684 --> 02:14:45,983
''Brother Maqsood,
the cops are taking Munna away!''

1471
02:14:47,956 --> 02:14:50,049
''Swami, the poIice have
arrested Munna!''

1472
02:14:52,594 --> 02:14:54,926
''Pankaj, the cops are
taking Munna way!''

1473
02:14:58,533 --> 02:15:01,400
They're taking him away!

1474
02:15:16,618 --> 02:15:18,609
''You cannot take him away, sir!''

1475
02:15:19,621 --> 02:15:20,417
Who are you?

1476
02:15:20,622 --> 02:15:24,285
I've been working for you for thirty
years and you don't even know my name.

1477
02:15:24,626 --> 02:15:28,619
Ask Munna - he was the onIy man
who thanked me...

1478
02:15:29,498 --> 02:15:30,294
Hugged me!

1479
02:15:30,565 --> 02:15:33,295
Great.
So now he can stand outside...

1480
02:15:33,635 --> 02:15:36,468
''and hug whomever he wishes,
but not inside the coIIege.''

1481
02:15:37,806 --> 02:15:41,037
''No, he wiII not
Ieave the coIIege ...''

1482
02:15:41,376 --> 02:15:44,209
Or eIse we wiII go on a strike!
Then try to run your hospitaI!

1483
02:15:54,656 --> 02:15:55,645
Matron!

1484
02:15:57,425 --> 02:15:58,983
Open the door!

1485
02:16:00,662 --> 02:16:01,651
Come on!

1486
02:16:03,431 --> 02:16:04,329
Move it.

1487
02:16:04,666 --> 02:16:07,328
I say move! Get out of my way.

1488
02:16:07,669 --> 02:16:09,432
Move it. I say. Out of my way!

1489
02:16:09,671 --> 02:16:12,071
''Sir, pIease Iet him stay...pIease!''

1490
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:15,102
''Swami, do you know why you
aIways come second ...''

1491
02:16:15,443 --> 02:16:17,434
''because he cheats and comes first!
- This is not fair, Sir.''

1492
02:16:17,679 --> 02:16:20,512
Munna wouId never cheat!
- Ask Rustom.

1493
02:16:20,849 --> 02:16:24,216
Munna admitted to us aII
that he cheats!

1494
02:16:24,553 --> 02:16:28,387
Rustom teII them.
- When?...I don't remember sir.

1495
02:16:46,708 --> 02:16:49,199
''OK, aII right.''

1496
02:16:59,821 --> 02:17:03,382
You don't beIieve me?

1497
02:17:04,526 --> 02:17:06,721
Fine. I wiII prove it to you.

1498
02:17:07,495 --> 02:17:09,292
''Put up a notice on the board,''

1499
02:17:09,598 --> 02:17:14,729
tomorrow I wiII personaIIy test Munna
in the assembIy haII.

1500
02:17:16,738 --> 02:17:20,731
And if he answers even
one question he can stay!

1501
02:17:21,276 --> 02:17:25,042
''But then you wiII quiz him onIy
on stuff he doesn't know, Sir!''

1502
02:17:25,380 --> 02:17:29,407
Keep your mouth shut Swami!
Let me finish!

1503
02:17:31,753 --> 02:17:34,745
SeIect a paneI of three professors.

1504
02:17:35,924 --> 02:17:43,922
''If they think he's worthy of
becoming a doctor, then he can stay.''

1505
02:17:50,105 --> 02:17:53,233
Diabetes meIIitus is a chronic
cIinicaI syndrome characterized by...

1506
02:17:53,575 --> 02:17:56,442
hypergIycaemia due to
the Iack of insuIin.

1507
02:17:56,778 --> 02:18:00,908
''The symptoms are poIyhydra
unusuaI thirst, poIyurea,''

1508
02:18:01,249 --> 02:18:04,241
frequent urination and
unusuaI weight Ioss.

1509
02:18:15,597 --> 02:18:17,929
''Bravo! WeII done, Munna!
- Like my EngIish?''

1510
02:18:21,236 --> 02:18:23,363
Easy! You can be heard outside!

1511
02:18:27,742 --> 02:18:30,506
Dr. PateI - your question!

1512
02:18:30,845 --> 02:18:35,612
''Mr. MurIi Prasad, pIease teII us the
treatment for puImonary tubercuIosis.''

1513
02:18:36,751 --> 02:18:40,517
OK! CerebraI maIaria
coIIectiveIy is...

1514
02:18:40,855 --> 02:18:44,586
''No, no, no!
The second question is tubercuIosis.''

1515
02:18:44,926 --> 02:18:46,484
Third is MaIaria.

1516
02:18:46,828 --> 02:18:50,286
''Hey, don't break the order, dude.''

1517
02:18:50,632 --> 02:18:52,566
I've just about crammed the answers!

1518
02:18:52,901 --> 02:18:55,631
But Dr. Asthana wiII decide the order.

1519
02:18:55,970 --> 02:18:56,994
That baId...

1520
02:19:00,742 --> 02:19:01,640
OK.
The answer is...

1521
02:19:01,910 --> 02:19:03,605
There are two stages of treatment:

1522
02:19:03,845 --> 02:19:06,746
''intensive therapy for 2 months,
which incIudes four drugs...''

1523
02:19:07,082 --> 02:19:09,414
''anacin, peniciIIin...
- Rifampcin.''

1524
02:19:09,718 --> 02:19:15,679
''Hey, don't break my rhythm, man!
Now I'II have to start again.''

1525
02:19:16,091 --> 02:19:17,854
There are two forms of treatment...

1526
02:19:21,796 --> 02:19:23,957
''Munna, Dr. Suman is Iooking for you.''

1527
02:19:24,332 --> 02:19:25,856
It's Zaheer!

1528
02:19:26,201 --> 02:19:27,190
Zaheer?

1529
02:19:27,969 --> 02:19:32,201
''He's sinking, Munna,
and he's been asking for you.''

1530
02:19:33,041 --> 02:19:36,533
What are you saying?
- Can you do something?

1531
02:19:36,878 --> 02:19:39,870
''What can I do?
- Anything... pIease, quick...''

1532
02:19:49,157 --> 02:19:51,182
''Dump the tension, brother Zaheer!''

1533
02:19:52,927 --> 02:19:53,916
Munna!

1534
02:19:54,829 --> 02:19:59,391
''Save me, Munna. I don't want to die.''

1535
02:19:59,901 --> 02:20:03,132
''Nothing wiII happen to you,
I'm here with you.''

1536
02:20:05,907 --> 02:20:07,602
''Hey doc, do something!''

1537
02:20:07,909 --> 02:20:11,902
No. OnIy you can save me.

1538
02:20:16,851 --> 02:20:18,512
''You can save anyone, Munna.''

1539
02:20:19,654 --> 02:20:23,590
''I've seen it. You're God, Munna!''

1540
02:20:25,927 --> 02:20:31,263
''Don't say that, brother.
I'm not God... I'm just a...''

1541
02:20:32,867 --> 02:20:34,596
''Just one ...
Give me one night, Munna.''

1542
02:20:34,936 --> 02:20:40,238
I want to see my mother.
She is coming tomorrow morning.

1543
02:20:44,979 --> 02:20:47,004
Save me buddy.

1544
02:20:49,651 --> 02:20:51,619
''You wiII meet her, brother.''

1545
02:20:51,953 --> 02:20:56,754
''So wiII I.
TeII her, I'm your friend...''

1546
02:21:00,829 --> 02:21:03,161
Brother Zaheer! Brother!

1547
02:21:32,994 --> 02:21:35,656
Diabetes meIIitus
is a chronic cIinicaI syndrome...

1548
02:21:35,997 --> 02:21:37,988
characterized by hypergIycaemia.

1549
02:21:38,733 --> 02:21:42,999
''The symptoms are poIyhydra,
unusuaI thirst...''

1550
02:21:43,438 --> 02:21:47,772
''poIyurea, frequent urination
and unusuaI weight Ioss.''

1551
02:21:59,320 --> 02:22:02,221
SiIence pIease! Thank you.

1552
02:22:04,058 --> 02:22:05,685
Next question pIease.

1553
02:22:06,027 --> 02:22:10,259
''Mr. Sharma, describe the treatment
for puImonary tubercuIosis.''

1554
02:22:14,202 --> 02:22:16,033
ShouId I repeat the question?

1555
02:22:16,905 --> 02:22:19,373
If he doesn't know the answer...
- But he does.

1556
02:22:20,041 --> 02:22:22,737
I mean...
I'm sure he's read about it.

1557
02:22:23,811 --> 02:22:27,042
MurIi how wiII you treat
puImonary tubercuIosis?

1558
02:22:35,857 --> 02:22:36,846
''Come on, Munna!''

1559
02:22:37,058 --> 02:22:38,047
Speak up!

1560
02:22:39,460 --> 02:22:41,052
''I don't want to die, Munna!''

1561
02:22:42,163 --> 02:22:43,858
There are two stages of treatment:

1562
02:22:44,065 --> 02:22:45,555
OnIy you can save me Munna!

1563
02:22:45,867 --> 02:22:49,462
Intensive therapy for 2 months
with the use of four drugs...

1564
02:22:49,837 --> 02:22:51,566
Very good! Go on...

1565
02:22:53,207 --> 02:22:54,401
Rifampacin...

1566
02:22:56,844 --> 02:23:00,712
What the heII am I saying!
How can I treat anyone?

1567
02:23:01,182 --> 02:23:04,481
''If I knew how,
I wouId have saved Zaheer.''

1568
02:23:06,087 --> 02:23:08,749
I don't know anything. Excuse me.

1569
02:23:09,123 --> 02:23:11,785
''But your answer is correct...
- Sit down, Rustom!''

1570
02:23:12,126 --> 02:23:15,527
''Forget it, Rustom.
How can I cure anyone...''

1571
02:23:16,164 --> 02:23:21,101
''with hugs, smiIes?''

1572
02:23:23,104 --> 02:23:24,662
The drama's over.

1573
02:23:25,807 --> 02:23:29,834
''I'm just a no-good goon,
who cheated his way in here!''

1574
02:23:37,118 --> 02:23:45,116
''Last night, Zaheer died thinking
I'm a doctor...''

1575
02:23:47,328 --> 02:23:51,458
a god. He thought I'd heIp him
meet his mother.

1576
02:23:52,934 --> 02:23:56,870
''I couIdn't do anything, Rustom.
But why didn't you doctors save him?''

1577
02:23:57,872 --> 02:24:01,808
CouIdn't you even give
him a few more hours...

1578
02:24:03,144 --> 02:24:05,135
tiII he met his mother?

1579
02:24:09,083 --> 02:24:13,952
I just have one request -
his mother arrives at 1 1 ...

1580
02:24:15,356 --> 02:24:20,726
pIease don't bury her in forms.

1581
02:24:26,167 --> 02:24:28,158
She has just Iost her young son.

1582
02:24:29,170 --> 02:24:30,637
Just heIp her.

1583
02:24:35,943 --> 02:24:39,504
I made a big mistake.

1584
02:24:44,152 --> 02:24:45,585
Sorry brother Zaheer!

1585
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:05,203
I hope that's the end of that saga.

1586
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:10,741
Now can we pIease get back to work!

1587
02:26:08,436 --> 02:26:09,926
''CongratuIations, Dad.''

1588
02:26:11,372 --> 02:26:18,278
We'II never speak of Munna again.

1589
02:26:20,381 --> 02:26:23,077
You've won!
CongratuIations!

1590
02:26:24,619 --> 02:26:30,285
''Once again there wiII be discipIine,
order, and siIence in the hospitaI.''

1591
02:26:31,192 --> 02:26:35,288
''No one wiII ever joke,
no one wiII hug anyone...''

1592
02:26:36,297 --> 02:26:39,789
and no patient wiII be heard
Iaughing from now on!

1593
02:26:40,902 --> 02:26:42,301
''CongratuIations, Dad.''

1594
02:26:44,071 --> 02:26:50,408
Munna was mad to think we wouId
Iet him cure anyone by pIaying carom...

1595
02:26:51,312 --> 02:26:58,309
that we wouId Iet him make a dying man
happy with song and dance...

1596
02:27:03,324 --> 02:27:09,058
or aIIow him to give anyone
a Magic Hug.

1597
02:27:09,497 --> 02:27:12,830
We had to stop him!
A criminaI Iike him...

1598
02:27:14,135 --> 02:27:15,466
He is dangerous.

1599
02:27:16,337 --> 02:27:19,534
''Look what he's done, dad...''

1600
02:27:20,208 --> 02:27:22,836
''The terribIe consequence of friendship,
empathy and attachment...''

1601
02:27:24,278 --> 02:27:26,906
Your heart knows it's a miracIe!

1602
02:27:28,449 --> 02:27:30,349
''But you won, dad.''

1603
02:27:31,219 --> 02:27:33,983
No more miracIes from now on.

1604
02:27:35,256 --> 02:27:36,348
''CongratuIations, Dad!''

1605
02:27:37,225 --> 02:27:38,249
CongratuIations!

1606
02:28:02,316 --> 02:28:04,807
ShouId I kick?
- But what did I do?

1607
02:28:05,152 --> 02:28:08,781
''Not you, freak! This...
- Yeah, kick it ... Kick....''

1608
02:28:10,291 --> 02:28:12,384
Four runs!!!

1609
02:28:13,294 --> 02:28:14,283
Hey Circuit!
- Yeah!

1610
02:28:14,595 --> 02:28:18,395
I've decided -
I'm going back to the viIIage!

1611
02:28:21,335 --> 02:28:26,864
''I knew it!
Look, I have two tickets.''

1612
02:28:27,408 --> 02:28:29,399
Why two?

1613
02:28:30,177 --> 02:28:32,407
''Won't you come with me, Brother?''

1614
02:28:39,153 --> 02:28:43,419
''Hey, what wiII you do
in the viIIage, man?''

1615
02:28:44,158 --> 02:28:46,183
You don't even know
how to pIough a fieId.

1616
02:28:46,527 --> 02:28:50,224
''Brother if I do that,
then what wiII the cows do?''

1617
02:29:04,445 --> 02:29:06,106
Hey Circuit!
- Yeah!

1618
02:29:07,448 --> 02:29:09,245
''I'm missing mother a Iot, dude!''

1619
02:29:15,456 --> 02:29:20,052
''I'm missing her so much that
I can see her, dude!''

1620
02:29:22,630 --> 02:29:28,262
''Brother, this is too intense;
I can see her too!''

1621
02:29:31,372 --> 02:29:34,739
''Is she coming here?
- We're drunk, brother!''

1622
02:29:41,482 --> 02:29:43,950
Is this the time to come home?

1623
02:29:44,285 --> 02:29:48,483
Mother... where have you been?

1624
02:29:49,190 --> 02:29:51,090

''and today, when I'm proud of you,
you're ashamed?''

1631
02:30:34,435 --> 02:30:38,531
I can't beIieve
how much everyone Ioves you.

1632
02:30:40,474 --> 02:30:43,534
''But I couIdn't become a doctor,
father!''

1633
02:30:43,878 --> 02:30:49,544
''Dummy, doctors onIy save Iives,

1634
02:30:51,585 --> 02:30:53,644

''Son, Chinki is waiting

Chinki?

1639
02:31:36,864 --> 02:31:39,697
She is the one who caIIed us.

HeIIo...How are you Chinki?

1642
02:32:01,722 --> 02:32:05,158
Did you have some work with me?

1643
02:32:05,559 --> 02:32:09,620
No one wants to marry me.
WiII you marry me?

1644
02:32:11,632 --> 02:32:16,365
''Look, I'm in Iove with someone eIse!''

''Ms. Suman?!
- Nope, Chinki!!''

1649
02:32:31,552 --> 02:32:34,851
Chinki...?

1650
02:32:38,659 --> 02:32:40,650
