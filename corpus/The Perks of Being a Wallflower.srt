Dear friend...

13
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:04,457
I am writing to you
because she said you listen and understand.

14
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,626
And didn't try to sleep
with that person at that party...

15
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,419
even though you could have.

16
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,089
Please, don't try to figure out who I am.

17
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,258
I don't want you to do that.

18
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:17,303
I just need to know that
people like you exist.

19
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,680
Like, if you met me you wouldn't...

20
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,768
think I was the weird kid
who spent time in the hospital.

21
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,523
And I wouldn't make you nervous.

22
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,319
I hope it's okay for me to think that.

23
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,696
You see, I haven't really
talked to anyone...

24
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,907
outside of my family all summer.

25
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,285
But tomorrow is my first day
of high school ever.

26
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,205
And I need to turn things around.

27
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,958
So I have a plan.

28
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,835
As I enter the school for the first time...

29
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,670
I will visualize what it will be like...

30
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,714
on the last day of my senior year.

31
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,175
Unfortunately, I counted and that's...

32
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,554
Hop, freshman toads! Hop! Let's move it!

33
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:03,182
1,385 days from now.

34
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,476
We worked out all summer. Rock hard.

35
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,645
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you guys get a room?

36
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:12,316
Just 1,385 days.

37
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,237
In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister,
Candace, and her boyfriend, Derek...

38
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,322
would have let me eat lunch
with their Earth Club.

39
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,740
Seniors only.

40
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,202
What are you doing with that plastic spork?

41
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,413
I don't wanna bring back silverware.

42
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:29,876
Derek, you're Earth Club treasurer.
Come on!

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,378
When my sister said "No," I thought...

44
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,424
maybe my old friend Susan
would wanna have lunch with me.

45
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,511
In middle school,
Susan was very fun to be around...

46
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,598
but now she doesn't
like to say "Hi" to me anymore.

47
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,182
And then there's Brad Hays.

48
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,269
Before my older brother
went to play football for Penn State...

49
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,979
he and Brad played together...

50
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,648
so I thought maybe he'd say "Hi" to me.

51
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,400
But Brad's a senior.

52
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,236
And I'm me. So who am I kidding?

53
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,447
On the bright side...

54
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,909
one senior decided to make fun of the
teacher instead of the freshmen.

55
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,953
He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
legendary goatee...

56
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,413
with a grease pencil.

57
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,919
The prick punch is not a toy.

58
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,880
I learned that back in 'Nam in '68.

59
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,757
"Callahan," sergeant said...

60
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,883
"you put down that prick punch.

61
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,927
You go kill some gooks."

62
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,803
And you know what happened?

63
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,432
That prick punch killed my best friend
in a Saigon whorehouse.

64
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,810
I heard you were gonna be in my class.

65
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,187
Are you proud to be a senior...

66
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,315
having to take freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?

67
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,108
Look, my name is Patrick.

68
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,361
Either you call me Patrick
or you call me nothing.

69
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,446
Okay, Nothing.

70
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,367
I felt really bad for Patrick.

71
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:48,245
He wasn't doing the impersonation
to be mean or anything.

72
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,207
He was just trying
to make us freshmen feel better.

73
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,126
Nothing, why don't you read first?

74
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,837
All right. "Chapter One.

75
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,923
Surviving your fascist shop teacher...

76
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,716
who needs to put kids down to feel big."

77
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,094
Wow,
this is useful, guys. We should read on.

78
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:07,473
My last class of the day
is Advanced English...

79
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,350
and I'm really excited to finally learn...

80
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,061
with the smartest kids in the school.

81
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,147
Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.

82
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,567
Believe it or not, she's gotten
straight A's since kindergarten.

83
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,904
Shh!

84
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,447
I'm Mr. Anderson.

85
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,700
I'm gonna be your teacher
for freshman English.

86
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,118
This semester we're gonna learn about...

87
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,120
Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.

88
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,621
Genius book.

89
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,790
Now, who'd like to get out
of the first pop quiz?

90
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,670
I'm shocked. All right.
Well, you can skip the quiz...

91
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,131
if you tell me which author
invented the paperback book.

92
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,508
Anyone?

93
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,260
He was British.

94
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,220
He also invented the serial.

95
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,725
In fact, at the end of
the third chapter of his first novel...

96
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,979
he had a man hanging from
a cliff by his fingernails.

97
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,731
Hence the term "cliff hanger."

98
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,358
Anybody?

99
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,402
- Yeah?
- Shakespeare.

100
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,154
That's a great guess, but no.

101
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,947
Shakespeare didn't write novels.

102
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,450
Anybody else?

103
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,245
The author...

104
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,460
was Charles Dickens.

105
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,754
However, if you and I had
gone to a Shakespeare play...

106
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,672
it would have cost us four pennies.

107
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:22,882
Can you imagine that?

108
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,551
We would have put those
pennies in a metal box.

109
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,553
The ushers would lock it in the office.

110
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,221
And that's where we get the term...

111
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,723
Cash register.

112
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,392
Office Max.

113
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,061
I'll give you a free "A" on anything...

114
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,188
except the final term
paper if you get it right.

115
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,651
Box office.

116
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,156
You should learn to participate.

117
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,702
Why didn't you raise your hand?

118
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,957
They call you the "teacher's pet"?

119
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,334
"Freak"? That kinda thing?

120
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,045
I used to get "spaz."

121
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,505
I mean, come on, "spaz"?

122
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,386
You know, I heard
you had a tough time last year.

123
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,348
But they say if you make one friend...

124
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,558
on your first day, you're doing okay.

125
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,519
Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher...

126
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,270
is the only friend I make today...

127
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,439
that would be sort of depressing.

128
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,817
Yeah, I can see that.

129
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,444
Don't worry, Mr. Anderson, I'm okay.

130
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,529
Thanks.

131
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,412
I would happily not take shop...

132
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,540
Hey, freshman toad.

133
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,838
Well, I have 1,384 days to go.

134
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,258
Just so I say it to someone...

135
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,177
high school is even worse
than middle school.

136
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,806
If my parents ask me about it...

137
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,142
I probably won't tell them the truth...

138
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,518
because I don't want them...

139
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,563
to worry that I might get bad again.

140
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,482
If my Aunt Helen were still here,
I could talk to her...

141
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,151
and I know she would understand...

142
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,653
how I'm both happy and sad.

143
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,031
And I'm still trying
to figure out how that could be.

144
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,951
I just hope I make a friend soon.

145
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,704
Love always, Charlie.

146
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,540
Charlie? Come on.

147
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,794
This chicken paprikash is delicious.

148
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,838
Thank you, Derek. It's Charlie's favorite.

149
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,675
He was a little nervous about starting high
school today, so I made it for him.

150
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,759
Feel a little silly
about being nervous now, Champ?

151
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,722
Yes, sir. I sure do.

152
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,016
I told you, just give 'em a smile...

153
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,517
and be yourself.

154
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,728
- That's how you—
- Make friends in the real world.

155
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,354
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

156
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,274
Freshman year is tough, but...

157
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,234
you really find yourself.

158
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,200
Thanks, Derek.

159
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,202
You could have been a
little nicer to Derek.

160
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,122
I'm sorry, the kid's a pussy.
I can't stand him.

161
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,374
- I really hope you love the mix tape I made.
- I do.

162
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,461
- The cover is hand-painted.
- Wow.

163
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,759
Hey, Charlie, you want this?

164
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,303
Are you sure?

165
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,347
He gives me one every week.

166
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,477
Hey, babe.

167
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,023

but it reminded me of your eyes.

Right. Come on, offense!

183
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,460
- Hey, Nothing.
- Hey, Nothing.

184
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,003
Suck it, virginity pledges.

185
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,964
Suck it.

186
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,468
You're in trouble now, Jaguars!

187
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,732
Hey, Patrick.

188
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,401
Hey. You're in my shop class, right?

189
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,028
How's your clock coming?

190
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,613
My dad's building it for me.

191
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,657
Yeah. Mine looks like a boat.

192
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,910
You wanna sit over here
or are you waiting for your friends?

193
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,578
No, no, no, I'll sit.

194
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,708
Thanks for not calling
me Nothing by the way.

195
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,377
It's an endless nightmare.

196
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,941
And these assholes,
they actually think they're being original.

197
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,716
So do you like football?

198
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,884
Love it. Love football.

199
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,469
Maybe you know my brother then.

200
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,054
Hey, Sam.

201
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,224
Question. Could the bathrooms
here be more disgusting?

202
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,267
Yes. They call it the men's room.

203
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,063
So I finally got hold of Bob.

204
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,107
Party tonight?

205
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,652
He's still trying to shag
that waitress from the Olive Garden.

206
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,153
He's never tossing that salad.

207
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,033
Come on!

208
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,578
Patrick.

209
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,496
Yeah?

210
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,997
Who's this?

211
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,040
This is-

212
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:31,875
Charlie Kelmeckis.

213
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,252
Kelmeckis?

214
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,463
No shit? Your sister's dating
Ponytail Derek, isn't she?

215
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,340
- God.
- Is that what they call him?

216
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,259
Would you leave Ponytail Derek alone?

217
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,511
You put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.

218
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,596
I try. Sam, I try.

219
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,808
It's nice to meet you, Charlie.
I'm Sam.

220
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,727
- What's the plan? Are we going
to Mary Elizabeth's tonight?
- Nope.

221
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,647
She got caught watering down her parents'
brandy with iced tea.

222
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,441
Let’s just go to Kings.

223
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:59,903
All right. We're goin' to Kings
after the game if you wanna come.

224
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,590
Do you have a favorite band?

225
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,925
Well, I think The Smiths are my favorite.

226
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,846
Are you kidding?
I love The Smiths. Best breakup band ever.

227
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,347
What's your favorite song?

228
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,225
"Asleep." It’s from Louder than Bombs.

229
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,561
I heard it on Ponytail Derek's mix tape.

230
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,146
That works on so many levels.

231
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,607
I can make you guys a copy if you want.

232
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,651
- What about Eides? You love Eides, right?
- Yeah, of course. They're great.

233
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,403
Not a band, Charlie.

234
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,905
It's a record store downtown.

235
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,032
Things sound so much better on vinyl.

236
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,676
You know, I used to be popular
before Sam got me some good music.

237
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,579
So you be careful.
She'll ruin your life forever.

238
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,830
That's okay.

239
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,333
- Hey, Nothing.
- Hey, Nothing.

240
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,710
Let it go! Jesus!

241
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,463
It's an antique joke. It's over.

242
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,715
So what are you gonna do when you
get outta this place?

243
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,843
Well, my Aunt Helen said
I should be a writer...

244
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,512
but I don't know what I'd write about.

245
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,263
You could write about us.

246
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,808
Yeah! Call it Slut and the Falcon.

247
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,393
Make us solve crimes.

248
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,729
You guys seem really happy together.

249
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,733
How long have you been
boyfriend and girlfriend?

250
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,028
He's not my boyfriend. He's my stepbrother.

251
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,447
My mom finally left my worthless dad...

252
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,242
and married his nice dad
when we moved here.

253
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,286
But she's not bitter or anything.
Make no mistake.

254
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:34,248
Absolutely not. Charlie, I'm not a bulimic.

255
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,543
- I'm a bulim-ist.
- I'm sorry, I don't know what that is.

256
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,670
She just really believes in bulimia.

257
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,296
I love bulimia!

258
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,470
Hey. Thanks for paying, Charlie.

259
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,639
No problem. Thank you guys for the ride.

260
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,975
Maybe I'll see you around in school?

261
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:57,521
- God, would you turn it down?
You're gonna make us deaf.
- So be it. It's rock and roll.

262
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,606
Bye, Charlie!

263
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,733
- Bye, Charlie.
- Okay, bye.

264
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,581
Your mom says,
"Don't go to Columbia with Candace, Derek."

265
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,374
- Shh! Shut—
- "Don't go to Columbia!"

266
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,459
Do you always want to
be a mama's boy, Derek?

267
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,836
I am not a mama's boy!

268
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,796
You are, because
every single time I go to your house...

269
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Every single time!

270
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,841
Shut up, Candace!

271
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,844
You just stand there
like a little bitch dog.

272
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,015
No. Charlie—
Charlie, just go. I can handle it.

273
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,183
Just don't wake up Mom and Dad.

274
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,921
Hey! Look who's here.

275
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,133
Welcome home, Aunt Helen.

276
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,219
Aw! Look at you guys.

277
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,096
Dressed so nice.

278
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,939
Hey, Candace.

279
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,151
What are you doing?

280
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,573
Look, I egged him on. You saw it.

281
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:35,994
He's never hit me before, and I promise
you, he will never hit me again.

282
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,080
Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?

283
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,128
Charlie, this is Ponytail Derek.

284
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,464
I can handle him.

285
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,176
Do you trust me?

286
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,390
Please, don't tell Mom and Dad.

287
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,266
My God, they're playing good music!

288
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,310
Holy shit. Holy shit! They are!
They're playing good music.

289
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,896
- Living room routine.
- Living room routine.

290
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,857
- Yes.
- Yes!

291
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,775
Excuse us. Excuse me. Pardon.

292
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,444
Sorry.

293
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,363

It's not like it's cute or original.

320
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,420
- You'd hope it would be warm.
- Yeah, piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.

321
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,673
Are you sure it's okay that I come?

322
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,801
Yeah, of course.
Just remember, Charlie, Bob's not paranoid.

323
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,177
He's sensitive.

324
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,012
Sam!

325
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,307
That waitress from the Olive Garden,
she was such a tease.

326
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,726
Will you marry me?

327
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,395
Only with Patrick's blessing.

328
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,021
Patrick?

329
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,357
You are a hopeless stoner
who attends the culinary institute.

330
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,819
I'm gonna say "no" on that,
but nice try. Charlie.

331
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,529
Touché.

332
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:09,207
So, Charlie. This is a party.

333
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,468
This is what fun looks like.

334
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,180
Are you ready to meet some desperate women?

335
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,807
Here, have a seat.

336
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:26,933
Hey, ladies.

337
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,436
Meet Charlie.

338
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,606
- Hi.
- Meet ladies.

339
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,982
- Hey.
- Mary Elizabeth.

340
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,525
- Alice.
- Nice to meet you.

341
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,068
This is Charlie's first party ever.

342
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:42,157
So I expect nice, meaningful,
heartfelt blowjobs from both of you.

343
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,826
Patrick, you're such a dick.
Where the hell did you go?

344
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,454
- The dance was a little boring, don't you think?
- You are so selfish.

345
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,998
We looked everywhere for you.
You could have told someone.

346
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,458
Cry me a river.

347
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,920
How is it that you've got meaner since
becoming a Buddhist?

348
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,254
Just lucky, I guess.

349
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,631
No, you're doing something wrong, I think.

350
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,215
Or something very right.

351
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,301
- Yeah, well—
- Hey!

352
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,011
Look who's here.

353
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,556
Is that Brad Hays?

354
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,642
Yeah. He comes here sometimes.

355
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,810
But he's a popular kid.

356
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,979
Then what are we?

357
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:16,733
Charlie! You look like
you could use a brownie.

358
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,902
Thank you.

359
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,113
I was so hungry at the dance.
I was gonna go to Kings...

360
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,907
but I didn't really have any time.

361
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,533
Thanks.

362
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,257
Have you guys felt this carpet?

363
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,677
This carpet feels so darn good.

364
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,352
Charlie, Charlie,
what do you think about high school?

365
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,728
High school?

366
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,481
Bullshit.

367
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,525
The cafeteria is called
the Nutrition Center.

368
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,987
People wear their letter jackets
even when it's 98 degrees out.

369
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,864
And why do they give out
letter jackets to marching band?

370
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,742
It's not a sport.

371
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,160
We all know it.

372
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,371
This kid is crazy.

373
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,707
Mary Elizabeth,
I think you’re really gonna regret that...

374
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,585
you know— haircut when you
look back at old photographs.

375
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,921
My God!

376
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,590
I'm really sorry.
That sounded like a compliment in my head.

377
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,550
My God!

378
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:24,634
Well, it's kinda true.

379
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,094
Shut up!

380
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,304
I can't even be mad at him. Look at him.

381
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,723
Bob, did you get him stoned?

382
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,933
Come on, Sam, he likes
it, just look at him.

383
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,561
How do you feel, Charlie?

384
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,564
I just really want a milk shake.

385
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,991
Sam...

386
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,705
You have such pretty brown eyes.

387
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,415
The kind of pretty that deserves to make...

388
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,834
a big deal about itself though,
you know what I mean?

389
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:03,548
Okay, Charlie. Let me make the milk shake.

390
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,760
What a great word. Milk shake.

391
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:10,847
It's like when you say your name over
and over again in the mirror...

392
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,099
and after a while it sounds crazy.

393
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,518
So I'm guessing you've
never been high before?

394
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:18,104
No. No, no, no.

395
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,690
My best friend, Michael,
his dad was a big drinker...

396
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,359
so he hated all that stuff.

397
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,486
Parties too.

398
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,071
Well, where is Michael tonight?

399
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,615
He shot himself last May.

400
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,289
I kinda wished he'd left a note.
You know what I mean?

401
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,006
Where's the bathroom?

402
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,176
It's up the stairs.

403
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,552
Thanks, Sam.

404
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,346
You're so nice.

405
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,652
Charlie.

406
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,031
Weird.

407
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,331
Charlie.

408
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,791
What...

409
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,252
Who was that kid?

410
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,796
Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine.

411
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,631
Stay here.

412
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,383
I didn't see anything.

413
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,677
Yeah, I know you saw something,
but it's okay.

414
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,138
Okay, listen...

415
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,432
Brad doesn't want anyone to know.

416
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,310
Wait.

417
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,231
- Are you baked?
- Like a cake.

418
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,316
That's what Bob said.

419
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,986
And you can't have three on a match
because then they'd find us.

420
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,613
And everybody laughed
but I don't understand what's funny.

421
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:55,034
Okay, Charlie, listen.

422
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,454
I need you to promise...

423
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,916
that you're not gonna say anything
to anyone about me and Brad.

424
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,170
Okay? This has to be our little secret.

425
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,215
Our little secret. Agreed.

426
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,092
Okay.

427
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,802
Thank you.

428
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,012
We'll talk later.

429
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,766
I look forward to that big talk.

430
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,063
Can I have your cherry?

431
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,775
Isn't this the best milk shake ever, Alice?

432
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,444
It's even better than the first one.

433
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,911
Charlie just told me that
his best friend shot himself.

434
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,499
I don't think he has any friends.

435
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,383
Hey, everyone!

436
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,718
Everybody!

437
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:58,389
Everyone...

438
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,475
raise your glasses to Charlie.

439
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,355
- What did I do?
- You didn't do anything.

440
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,690
We just wanna toast to our new friend.

441
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,359
You see things.

442
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,069
And you understand.

443
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,821
You're a wallflower.

444
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,618
What is it? What's wrong?

445
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,372
I didn't think anyone noticed me.

446
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,045
Well, we didn't think
there was anyone cool left to meet.

447
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,172
So come on, everyone.

448
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,801
To Charlie.

449
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,302
To Charlie.

450
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,142
Welcome to the Island of Misfit Toys.

451
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,321
My God! What is this song?

452
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:56,948
Right? I have no idea.

453
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,783
Have you ever heard this before?

454
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,535
Never.

455
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,080
Patrick, we've gotta go through the tunnel.

456
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,540
Sam, it's freezing.

457
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,708
Patrick, It's the perfect song.

458
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,043
No. Mama Patrick says "No."

459
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:12,672
Patrick. It's Sam.
It's Sam speaking to you right now.

460
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,507
I'm begging you to do this for me.

461
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,258
I concede!

462
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,554
What is she doing?

463
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,556
Don't worry. She does it all the time.

464
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,312
Turn it up!

465
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,105
You got it, your highness.

Dear friend...

478
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,379
I'm sorry I haven't written for a while...

479
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,048
but I've been trying
hard not to be a loser.

480
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,094
For example, I'm trying to participate...

481
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,596
by listening to Sam's collection
of big rock ballads...

482
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,181
and thinking about love.

483
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,435
Sam says they're kitschy and brilliant.

484
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,978
I completely agree.

485
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:59,070
I'm also writing essays
and studying extra books outside of class.

486
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,948
As it turns out, Mr. Anderson is a writer.

487
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,950
He even had a play put
up in New York once...

488
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,035
which I think is very impressive.

489
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,787
Great Gatsby?

490
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:11,082
He and his wife might go back there
after this year.

491
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,460
I know this is selfish,
but I really hope he doesn't.

492
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,338
My favorite time, though, is lunch...

493
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,966
because I get to see Sam and Patrick.

494
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,760
We spend the time working on
Mary Elizabeth's fanzine...

495
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:25,555
about music and
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

496
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,765
It's called Punk Rocky.

497
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,809
Mary Elizabeth is really interesting...

498
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,270
because she's a Buddhist and a punk.

499
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:37,191
But somehow she always acts like my father
at the end of a long day.

500
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,277
Her best friend Alice loves vampires...

501
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,945
and wants to go to film school.

502
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,322
She also steals jeans from the mall.

503
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:46,367
I don't know why, because
her family is rich...

504
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,077
but I'm trying not to be judgmental.

505
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:52,165
Especially since I know that they
were all there for Patrick last year.

506
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,041
Patrick never likes to be serious...

507
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,086
so it took me a while to get what happened.

508
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:02,049
When he was a junior, Patrick started
seeing Brad on the weekends in secret.

509
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,843
I guess it was hard, too...

510
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,346
because Brad had to
get drunk every time they fooled around.

511
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,432
Then Monday in school, Brad would say...

512
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:13,186
"Man, I was so wasted I
don't remember a thing."

513
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,189
This went on for seven months.

514
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,859
When they finally did it,
Brad said he loved Patrick.

515
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,986
Then he started to cry.

516
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,696
No matter what Patrick did...

517
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,449
Brad kept saying that
his dad would kill him.

518
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,327
And saying that he was going to hell.

519
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:33,247
Patrick was eventually
able to help Brad get sober.

520
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,208
I asked Patrick if he felt sad...

521
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,127
that he still had to keep it a secret.

522
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,922
And he said "No," because at least now...

523
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,717
Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him.

524
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:49,222
I think I understand,
because I really like Sam.

525
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,973
I asked my sister about her...

526
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,892
and she said that when
Sam was a freshman...

527
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,312
the upperclass men used to
get her drunk at parties.

528
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,481
I guess she had a reputation.

529
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,024
But I don't care.

530
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:04,654
I'd hate for her to judge me based on
what I used to be like.

531
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:07,698
So I've been making her
a mix tape so she'll know how I feel.

532
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,285
Shit!

533
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,621
- C!
- C!

534
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,622
- Give me a K!
- K!

535
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,332
- Give me a Y!
- Y!

536
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,416
What's that spell?

537
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,501
Rocky!

538
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,669
I can't hear you!

539
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:20,670
Rocky!

540
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,046
One more time!

541
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,090
Rocky!

What did you use?

562
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,161
I know. Thank you.

563
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,331
Color film,
but black and white paper for printing.

564
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,667
Yeah. My professor gave me an A...

565
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,377
but for all the wrong reasons.

566
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,212
Most of them are idiots.

567
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,381
You'll see what I mean
when you get to college.

568
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,091
How'd your S.A.T.'s go, by the way?

569
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,344
1150. I think I'll get into NYU.

570
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,387
Yeah, I hope so.

571
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,765
1490. Harvard. Face.

572
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,602
So-

573
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,978
Are you okay?

574
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,939
Yeah. Yeah.

575
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,943
But I got my S.A.T. results back.

576
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:50,695
Oops.

577
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,572
You can take them again, you know.

578
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,367
Yeah, it’s just,
if I'm going to Penn State main campus...

579
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,327
I have to do much better.

580
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,579
I wish I would have studied freshman year.

581
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,125
It's a bit of a mess.

582
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,920
I'll help you study for the next one.

583
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,505
Will you?

584
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,840
Yeah. Of course.

585
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,676
Thanks, Charlie.

586
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,565
What's this?

587
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:31,235
It’s just a mix tape. No big deal.

588
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,279
My parents have a good stereo, so...

589
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,450
It's all about that night in the tunnel.

590
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,654
I couldn't find that song
that we were listening to...

591
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,413
but, you know, I'm still
searching for it, so yeah.

592
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,706
That's okay.

593
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,375
These are great.

594
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,086
Nick Drake.

595
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,338
The Shaggs.

596
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,467
You have really good taste, Charlie.

597
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:55,634
Really?

598
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,927
Yeah.

599
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,180
Way better than me as a freshman.

600
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,140
I used to listen to the worst Top 40.

601
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,392
- No.
- Yeah, I did.

602
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,854
Then I heard this old song.

603
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,149
"Pearly Dewdrops' Drop."

604
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,944
And I thought someday I'd be at a
party in college or something...

605
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:19,200
and I'd look up and see
this person across the room.

606
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,452
And from that moment, I'd know...

607
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,246
everything was going to be okay.

608
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,041
You know what I mean?

609
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,294
Yeah.

610
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,229
I hope it works out.

611
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,231
I don't know.

612
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,817
Craig would be
a big step up from her last boyfriend.

613
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:53,984
Yeah, no shit.

614
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,153
Who could forget Mr. Car Wash Loser?

615
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:59,490
I just hope she can stop playing dumb
with these guys.

616
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,118
I keep telling her, "Don't
make yourself small."

617
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,913
Can't save anybody.

618
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,749
Excuse me.

619
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,377
Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid.

620
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,921
How about something
a little bit more upbeat?

621
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,714
Let’s just see.

622
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,925
So Sam tells me you wanna be a writer.

623
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,053
Yeah.

624
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,429
Don't you write poetry, Craig?

625
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:29,270
Poetry writes me. You know?

626
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:31,939
Let's get this party started.

627
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,046
Wow.

628
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,132
That was fast.

629
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,300
You want another one?

630
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,426
Yeah.

631
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,552
All right.

632
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:11,937
Mr. Anderson?

633
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:15,065
Can I ask you something?

634
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,234
Yeah.

635
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:23,157
Why do nice people choose
the wrong people to date?

636
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,619
Are we talking about anyone specific?

637
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,413
Well...

638
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,420
We accept the love we think we deserve.

639
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,173
Can we make them know
that they deserve more?

640
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,008
We can try.

641
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,236
- Hey.
- Hey, Sam. Didn't see you come in.

642
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,947
How's it goin'?

643
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,908
You wanna start work on
probability and statistics?

644
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,201
Yeah. Sure.

645
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,579
Page 291 in your book.

646
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,208
And I ordered you some breakfast.

647
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,085
The country breakfast.

648
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,186
Dad?

649
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,397
Can I have 30 dollars?

650
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,649
Twenty dollars?
What do you need 10 dollars for?

651
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,025
Sam's doing Secret Santa.

652
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,403
It's her favorite thing in the world.
Please?

653
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,490
Have fun.

654
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,910
Thanks.

655
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,507
Charlie.

656
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,343
This was my favorite book growing up.

657
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:09,680
This is my copy, but I want you to have it.

658
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,391
Thanks.

659
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,851
Have a great Christmas break.

660
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,686
You, too, Mr. Anderson.

661
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,773
Terrible stain.

662
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,780
That's pretty good, Charlie.

663
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,830
You gotta be kidding me.

664
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,291
If you fail me, you get me next semester.

665
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,505
Whoo!

666
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:48,594
C minus!
Ladies and gentlemen, I am below average!

667
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,055
- Below average!
- Below average!

668
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,723
Guys, 1210.

669
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,849
What?

670
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:59,229
No more applications! No more S.A.T.'s!

671
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,106
Thank you, Charlie!

672
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,984
All right. All right, guys, I got...

673
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:07,154
Multiple pairs of bluejeans.

674
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,739
Wow, this is a really tough one...

675
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,908
but I'm gonna have to guess Alice.

676
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:11,950
Wait.

677
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:15,370
Guys, a receipt! She actually paid!

678
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,414
I'm so touched!

679
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:18,582
Where's Craig?

680
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,167
He went home to Connecticut.

681
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,461
But he'll be back for New Year's Eve.

682
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,506
Sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.

683
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,468
All right, big brother by three weeks,
who's your Secret Santa?

684
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,136
I'll tell you, Sam.

685
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,596
This one's tough.

686
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,848
I have received a harmonica...

687
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,934
a Magnetic Poetry set...

688
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,811
a book about Harvey Milk...

689
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:43,565
and a mix tape with
the song "Asleep" on it twice.

690
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,275
I mean, I have no idea.

691
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,112
This collection of presents is so gay...

692
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,614
that I think I must have
given them to myself.

693
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,033
But despite that distinct possibility...

694
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,536
I'm gonna have to go with...

695
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,662
Drum roll.

696
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,415
Charlie.

697
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,667
Obviously.

698
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:02,876
Beautifully done.

699
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,546
All right, Charlie. It's your turn.

700
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,714
Okay.

701
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,968
Okey dokey.

702
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:17,558
I have received socks, pants,
a shirt and a belt.

703
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,269
I was ordered to wear
them all tonight, so...

704
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:24,398
Guessing my Secret Santa is Mary Elizabeth.

705
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,108
Now why do you say that?

706
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,569
You know, she bosses
people around sometimes.

707
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:29,820
Sorry.

708
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,698
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Sorry.

709
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,701
You'll be surprised to know
that your Secret Santa is actually me.

710
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:37,870
Why all the clothes?

711
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:41,165
Well, all the great writers
used to wear great suits.

712
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,751
So your last present
is on a towel rack in the bathroom.

713
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,212
Delve into our facilities.

714
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,173
Emerge a star.

715
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,340
Perfect.

716
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,675
Will you hand these out while I'm gone?

717
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,093
Wait a second.

718
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,179
There's only Secret Santa presents.
There's rules.

719
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,390
Mary Elizabeth, why are you
trying to eat Christmas?

720
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,766
Hand them out, Sam.

721
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,769
All right. Mary Elizabeth. For you.

722
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,771
Alice.

723
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,023
Thanks.

724
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:07,816
Bob.

725
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,862
And this one's for me.

726
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,615
"Alice, I know you’ll get into NYU."

727
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,952
Forty dollars to print
Punk Rocky in color next time.

728
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,289
He knows me.

729
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,999
He really knows me.

730
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,225
All right, Charlie.

731
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,060
Come on out.

732
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,269
Get out here, buddy.

733
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:45,479
Come on, Charlie. Charlie!

734
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,982
Don't be shy.

735
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,777
Come out, come out, wherever...

736
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,911
Yeah!

737
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,332
What a display of man I have never seen!

738
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,085
Where are we going?

739
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,836
It's a surprise.

740
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,423
Is this your room?

741
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,346
So cool.

742
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,223
Thanks.

743
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,313
You got me a present?

744
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:30,732
After all your help
on my Penn State application?

745
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,859
Of course I did.

746
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,029
Open it!

747
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,995
I don't know what to say.

748
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,413
You don't have to say anything.

749
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,145
I'm really sorry we can't
be here for your birthday.

750
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,481
No, that's okay. I'm just sorry
you have to go back and visit your dad.

751
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,318
I'm in such a good mood
I don't think even he could ruin it.

752
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,820
I feel like I'm finally doing good.

753
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,030
You are.

754
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,907
Well, what about you?

755
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:24,745
When I met you,
you were this scared freshman.

756
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,414
Now look at you in that suit.

757
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,834
You're like a sexy English schoolboy.

758
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,336
I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out.

759
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,378
No.

760
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,006
Innocent.

761
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,507
Worst kinda guys.

762
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:38,759
Never see you coming.

763
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,053
And parents love you.

764
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,388
That's, like...

765
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:45,057
extra danger.

766
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,184
Yeah, well, it hasn't worked so far.

767
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,269
You've never had a girlfriend?

768
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,438
Not even like a second grade Valentine?

769
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,564
Nope.

770
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,399
Have you ever kissed a girl?

771
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:55,609
No.

772
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,111
What about you?

773
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,742
Have I ever kissed a girl?

774
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,952
No, no. Your first kiss.

775
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,706
I was 11.

776
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,541
His name was Robert.

777
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,919
He used to come over to
the house all the time.

778
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,629
Was he your first boyfriend?

779
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,049
He was my...

780
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,301
He was my dad's boss.

781
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:28,892
You know, Charlie, I used to sleep
with guys who treated me like shit.

782
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,520
And get wasted all the time.

783
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:33,980
But now I feel like...

784
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,775
I have a chance. Like...

785
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,152
I can even get into a real college.

786
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:41,029
It's true. You can do it.

787
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,786
You really think so?

788
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:58,839
My aunt had that same thing
done to her, too.

789
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,341
And she turned her life around.

790
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,595
She must have been great.

791
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,515
She was my favorite person in the world.

792
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,850
Until now.

793
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,443
Charlie...

794
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:26,366
I know that you know I like Craig.

795
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:29,870
But I want to forget about that
for a minute, okay?

796
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,788
Okay.

797
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:36,042
I just wanna make sure
that the first person who kisses you...

798
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,503
loves you.

799
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:39,796
Okay?

800
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:44,926
Okay.

801
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,238
I love you, Charlie.

802
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,993
I love you, too.

803
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,002
I wanna do Secret Santa forever!

804
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,843
Have a good time at your mom's.

805
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:29,721
Thanks. And, listen, Charlie.

806
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,932
Because your birthday's on Christmas Eve...

807
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,892
I figure you don't get that many presents?

808
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,229
I thought you should have my clock.

809
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,522
From the heart.

810
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,357
Thank you, Patrick.

811
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:43,777
Bye.

812
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:47,030
Have a good one, guys.

813
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,449
I love you guys!

814
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,624
Hey!

815
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,625
Look who's here.

816
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:04,506
- Come here, little sister.
- Hey, Chris.

817
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,883
Hey, honey.

818
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:09,177
Ma, you look so thin.

819
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:11,012
You. Look at you.

820
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,138
Charlie.

821
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:16,851
Come on, I got dinner ready.

822
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,478
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

823
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:19,896
Let's eat.

824
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:21,773
Make a wish, honey.

825
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,829
Can you see it, Charlie?

826
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,874
The luminaria is a landing strip
for Santa Claus.

827
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:43,336
Why don't you keep an eye out for him,
and I will be right back, okay?

828
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,508
Going to get your birthday present.

829
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:03,148
Hey.

830
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,277
God, I miss Mom's cooking.

831
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,404
You have no idea how good you have it.

832
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,325
I'm actually starting to hate pizza.

833
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,411
So how you liking school?

834
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:20,040
Well, I'm no braniac like you or Candace.

835
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,334
I'm doing okay.

836
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,419
Okay? You're playing in a bowl game.

837
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,679
How are you feeling, Charlie?

838
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:37,849
Good.

839
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,809
No, you know what I mean.

840
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:41,853
Is it bad tonight?

841
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,690
No.

842
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,903
I'm not picturing things anymore.

843
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,114
Or if I do, I can just shut it off.

844
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,662
Well, you know, Mom did say
that you have good friends now.

845
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:02,290
And maybe if it does get bad again...

846
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,084
you can just talk to them. Yeah?

847
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,294
Yeah.

848
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:10,215
Especially Sam. She's great.

849
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,884
I'm gonna ask her out at New Year's.

850
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,594
I think the time is right now.

851
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:25,723
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

852
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,797
How long does this take to work?

853
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,731
Shovelin' snow?

854
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,234
I have to get this driveway clean.

855
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,194
And then...

856
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,614
I'm going to congratulate
you on being happy.

857
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:17,991
'Cause you deserve it.

858
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,161
You said that an hour ago.

859
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:22,454
Was that tonight?

860
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,834
I just...

861
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,670
saw this tree, but it was a dragon.

862
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,131
Then it was a tree again
and it just lied to me.

863
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,508
Okay, Charlie,
don't freak out. Give me this.

864
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,469
Calm down.

865
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,640
Look up.

866
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,603
Isn't it quiet?

867
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:52,192
Sam, do you think if people knew...

868
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:55,779
how crazy you really were,
no one would ever talk to you?

869
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,574
All the time.

870
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,955
So you wanna wear these glasses?

871
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,959
They'll protect you.

872
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,711
10, 9, 8, 7...

873
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:37,672
6, 5, 4...

874
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,674
3, 2, 1!

875
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,467
It's gonna be our little secret.

876
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:43,529
Did your older friends pressure you?

877
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:46,407
No one pressured me, Officer.

878
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:49,953
I would never do drugs. Never.

879
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:53,414
Then how did you happen to be passed out
on the ground at 6:00 in the morning?

880
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:59,420
Well, I, um— I-I was really tired.

881
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:02,507
And I was feeling feverish...

882
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:07,303
so I went outside
for a walk just to get some cold air.

883
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,806
I started seeing things, so I passed out.

884
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,391
You're seeing things again, Charlie?

885
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,686
Not really.

886
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,360
Nice suit.

887
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,030
It was a Christmas present.

888
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,537
Did you have fun on your break?

889
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:35,248
More fun than you're gonna
have today, Sinatra.

890
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,794
Nice look, jag-off.

891
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,008
I've called him 30 times.

892
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:47,373
What are we supposed to do?
We're going on in 10 minutes.

893
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,179
- They said in health class—
- Hello?

894
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,348
They say that about
L.S.D.just to scare you.

895
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:55,601
- Are you sure? You know I've seen—
- Charlie, you're fine, man.

896
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,271
Guys, we have an emergency.

897
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,981
Craig has flaked out on us again.

898
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,607
So I need a Rocky.

899
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:02,734
Brad?

900
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,193
No. No way. No. I'm not...

901
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,820
There's people out there. No.

902
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,744
Charlie, take off your clothes.

Well, we're filled up now...

916
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,987
but they're gonna
need people when we go to college.

917
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:33,366
We could put in a good word for you.

918
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,368
That'd be great. Thanks.

919
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,285
Yeah.

920
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,124
Charlie...

921
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:44,460
Have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?

922
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,045
The one where the girl asks the guy?

923
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:49,173
Obviously, it is completely stupid.

924
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:52,802
And sexist. I mean, it's like
"Hey, thanks for the crumb."

925
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,973
And normally, I would just blow it off,
because school dances suck torture.

926
00:57:57,057 --> 00:58:00,393
But, you know, it's my last year and...

927
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,815
Would you maybe wanna go with me?

928
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,692
You wanna go with me?

929
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:10,653
Yeah, I'm sick of macho guys.

930
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,156
Plus you looked really
cute in your costume.

931
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,116
So what do you say?

932
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,955
You must be Mary Elizabeth.

933
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:22,623
Yes.

934
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,000
It's so nice to meet you.

935
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:25,793
You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.

936
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:28,129
Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.

937
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,756
- Please, come in.
- Okay.

938
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,300
A little closer together.

939
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,843
That looks nice.

940
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,928
Buddhist, I need you to
smile a little bit more.

941
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,763
There you go. Nice.

942
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,129
Hey.

943
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:11,631
Hey.

944
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,216
Are you having a good time?

945
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:19,138
Not really. How about you?

946
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:21,682
I mean, I don't know.

947
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,227
It's my first date, I don't
have much to compare it to.

948
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,312
You're doing fine.

949
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:33,402
Sorry Craig couldn't come.

950
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:37,531
Yeah. He said he didn't want to go to
some stupid high school dance.

951
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:40,534
I can't say I blame him really.

952
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:43,996
I don't know.
If you like it, he should come.

953
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,544
Thanks, Charlie.

954
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,633
Have a beautiful first date.

955
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,718
You deserve it.

956
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,387
I'll try not to make you too jealous.

957
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,111
Now just let it breathe.

958
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:24,996
Whoa.

959
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,000
It sure is a nice house.

960
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,293
Thanks.

961
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:38,050
Don't you just love old music?

962
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,510
Yeah.

963
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,555
Good. 'Cause I made you a mix of it.

964
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,435
I'd love to expose you
to great things like...

965
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,229
Billie Holiday and foreign films.

966
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:53,524
This merlot is really fancy.

967
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,402
Yeah. My dad collects wine,
but he doesn't drink.

968
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,987
That's kinda weird, isn't it?

969
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:01,157
I guess. Where are your parents?

970
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:04,035
Their club's hosting
a cotillion or something racist.

971
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,913
They'll be gone all night.

972
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,172
Sure is a nice fire.

973
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:19,258
Yeah.

974
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:20,676
When I'm done being a lobbyist...

975
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:23,804
I wanna move to a house
like this in Cape Cod.

976
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,181
Sounds nice, doesn't it?

977
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,265
Yeah.

978
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,273
Your heart is beating really fast.

979
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:35,691
Is it?

980
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:37,985
Here. Feel.

981
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,451
Charlie?

982
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,953
Do you like me?

983
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,206
You know what I mean.

984
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,665
I think so.

985
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,377
Don't be nervous.

986
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,165
Charlie.

987
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,379
I didn't know how tonight
was gonna go, but...

988
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,090
It's really nice, isn't it?

989
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,508
Yeah.

990
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:46,095
I just can't believe it.

991
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,931
You, of all people.

992
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,600
I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.

993
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,358
Shit! My parents! Shit!

994
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:01,610
- Here, zip this up.
- Okay. No, I got this.

995
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,135
Just zip it up like a normal zipper!

996
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,321
It's stuck. It’s just...

997
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,824
Thank you.

998
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,033
See you Monday.

999
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,954
Dear friend...

1000
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,207
sorry I haven't written for a while...

1001
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,877
but things are a total disaster.

1002
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,839
We're literally making
out and I'm in my bra...

1003
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,507
Hello!
And the front door opens, it's my parents!

1004
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:25,801
I probably should have been honest about...

1005
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:28,971
how I didn't want to go out with
Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but...

1006
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,307
I really didn't want to hurt her feelings.

1007
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,478
You see, Mary Elizabeth
is a really nice person...

1008
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,855
underneath the part of
her that hates everyone.

1009
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,523
Hey!

1010
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:41,275
And since I heard that
having a girlfriend makes you happy...

1011
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,861
I tried hard to love her like I love Sam.

1012
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,988
Can you believe it's almost
our 2-week anniversary?

1013
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,199
Yeah, I know.

1014
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,783
So I took her on double dates.

1015
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,870
First foreign film.

1016
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,164
Do you want butter on your popcorn?

1017
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,874
Vegans don't eat butter.

1018
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,585
And I tried not to mind
that she loves to hold hands...

1019
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,212
even when her hands are sweaty.

1020
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,552
And I had to admit something
really upsetting, but...

1021
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:13,557
I'm tired of touching her boobs.

1022
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:17,061
I thought maybe if she would just let me
pick the make-out music...

1023
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:20,189
once in a while, we might have a chance.

1024
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:24,652
And maybe if she didn't put down the books
that Mr. Anderson gives me.

1025
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:26,862
Walden.

1026
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:29,156
I read this in 7th grade.

1027
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:31,784
I would have called it On Boring Pond.

1028
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:35,913
Or if she would stop calling me the minute
I get home from school...

1029
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:40,626
when I have absolutely nothing to talk
about other than the bus ride home.

1030
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,005
Somehow she finds new things to say.

1031
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,590
That dairy just sits with you.

1032
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:48,050
You know, it walks with you.

1033
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,010
She's on the phone right now?

1034
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,720
Charlie, you've gotta break up with her.

1035
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,055
I can do that?

1036
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,932
For Christ's sake, I need to use the phone.

1037
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,559
I got you this book.

1038
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:57,810
It's really how I became a vegan.

1039
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,436
I know I should have been honest...

1040
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:02,648
but I was getting so mad,
it was starting to scare me.

1041
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,400
I mean the way they treat those-

1042
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:07,570
I just wish I could have
found another way to break up.

1043
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:09,905
Um, Mary Elizabeth, can I talk to you...

1044
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,408
Charlie, please don't interrupt.
You know I hate that.

1045
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,412
In hindsight, I probably
could not have picked...

1046
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:17,079
a worse way to be honest with
Mary Elizabeth.

1047
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,163
Truth or dare?

1048
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:19,665
Who are you talking to?

1049
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:23,502
I dare you to kiss Alice.

1050
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:28,799
Gird your loins, procreator.

1051
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,343
My God.

1052
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:34,930
Mary Elizabeth, Samantha told me
that you got into Harvard. Congratulations.

1053
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:39,351
Thank you. This one still
hasn't gotten me flowers.

1054
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,978
But I forgive you.

1055
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,399
Hey, don't worry about Penn State.
You’re just wait-listed.

1056
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,443
Yeah.

1057
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:51,238
You guys are about to miss
some severely hot fag-on-goth action.

1058
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,202
Wow.

1059
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,788
Get a room.

1060
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,582
You're a monster.

1061
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,127
My turn. Let's see.

1062
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,421
Let's think. Charlie.

1063
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,380
Truth.

1064
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:09,905
How's your first relationship going?

1065
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,801
It's so bad...

1066
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:17,222
that I keep fantasizing
that one of us is dying of cancer.

1067
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,933
So that I don't have to break up with her.

1068
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,647
Charlie? Truth or dare?

1069
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:25,939
Hello?

1070
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,526
Dare.

1071
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:33,530
Okay, I dare you
to kiss the prettiest girl in the room...

1072
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:34,990
on the lips.

1073
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,743
And notice I charitably said
"girl" and not "person"...

1074
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,871
because, let's face it,
I'd smoke all you bitches.

1075
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,424
That's fucked up.

1076
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,430
Mary Elizabeth.

1077
01:06:58,515 --> 01:06:59,932
I'm so sorry.

1078
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:04,353
It was a mistake, I'm sorry.

1079
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,230
Sam? Sam?

1080
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:08,857
I really didn't mean anything by it.
I'm sorry.

1081
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,735
What the hell is wrong with you?

1082
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,906
I should go back and apologize.

1083
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,992
Charlie, trust me,
you don't wanna go back in there.

1084
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:22,204
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to do anything.

1085
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,622
I know you didn't.

1086
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:26,083
But, look-

1087
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,629
I hate to be the one to break this...

1088
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:34,758
but there's history with
Mary Elizabeth and Sam.

1089
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:38,137
Other guys and things that have
nothing to do with you.

1090
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:41,974
It's best if you just stay away for a while.

1091
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:45,436
Okay.

1092
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,483
How long do you think?

1093
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,097
Charlie.

1094
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:24,391
Come on, get dressed.
You're gonna be late for Easter Mass.

1095
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:26,018
I'll be there in a minute.

1096
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:34,610
Our Father,
who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

1097
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:39,198
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven.

1098
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,325
Give us this day our daily bread...

1099
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:43,327
and forgive us our trespasses...

1100
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:46,038
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1101
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,920
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

1102
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:57,466
Mary Elizabeth, I've been listening
to the Billie Holiday CD every night.

1103
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,926
It's too late, Charlie.

1104
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:02,137
I know.
I just feel really bad about what I did.

1105
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:05,098
I just get so messed up inside.

1106
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:06,892
Like I'm not there or something.

1107
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,353
Tell it to someone who cares.
Look, I know. I'm sorry.

1108
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,063
Just we've all become such good friends.

1109
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,106
Good friends?

1110
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:15,067
Do you mean the people
that I've known since kindergarten...

1111
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,985
and you've known for six months?

1112
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,612
Those good friends?

1113
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,031
Yeah, I mean, I just don't wanna do
anything to ruin our relationship.

1114
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,741
It's ruined. Okay?

1115
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,994
So stop calling everyone.
Stop embarrassing yourself.

1116
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:29,373
Okay, I will. Good...

1117
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:37,047
- Something's wrong with me.
- Don't worry about it.

1118
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:41,885
Hey, have you heard from Patrick?

1119
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:44,596
No, he told me to stay away.

1120
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,391
You don't know.

1121
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:49,726
Why? Why? What happened?

1122
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:52,104
Brad's father caught them together.

1123
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,277
Some kids jumped him outside the O.

1124
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:00,904
No, it was some kids from North Hills.

1125
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,407
Did you see his face?

1126
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:04,908
That's not what I heard.

1127
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:08,495
Are you okay?

1128
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:11,373
Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry.

1129
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,300
Hey, Nothing.

1130
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:32,311
Oops. Sorry, Nothing.

1131
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,073
You gonna do anything?

1132
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,450
What are you talking about?

1133
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,660
I'm talking about
your pet ape just tripped me.

1134
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:49,828
Gonna say something?

1135
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:53,540
- Why would I?
- You know why.

1136
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:57,419
This is pathetic, man. Your fixation on me.

1137
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,588
Do you want your friends
to know how you got those bruises? Really?

1138
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,465
I got jumped in a parking lot.

1139
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:03,258
Where? Schenley Park?

1140
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:05,469
Do you guys know about Schenley Park?

1141
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,387
- Do your friends know—
- I don't know what kinda sick shit...

1142
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:11,224
you're trying to pull,
but you better walk away right now.

1143
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,685
Nothing.

1144
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,187
Fine.

1145
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:18,523
Say hi to your dad for me.

1146
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,738
Whatever, faggot.

1147
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:29,276
- What did you just call me?
- Just called you a faggot.

1148
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:46,885
Say that shit again! Say that shit again!

1149
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,220
It's Patrick!

1150
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,681
Leave him alone!

1151
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:52,057
Sam!

1152
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:02,776
Stop! Leave him! Stop!

1153
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:04,903
Stop!

1154
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:40,230
Touch my friends again and I'll blind you.

1155
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,700
Charlie?

1156
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:52,868
Yeah?

1157
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,454
Thanks for stopping 'em.

1158
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,332
Sure, Brad.

1159
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:22,814
How you doing, Charlie?

1160
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:24,900
I don't know.

1161
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:28,111
I keep trying, but I can't
really remember what I did.

1162
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:30,697
Do you want me to tell you?

1163
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,784
Yeah.

1164
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,744
You saved my brother.

1165
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,163
That's what you did.

1166
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,582
So you're not scared of me?

1167
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,792
No.

1168
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:45,754
Can we be friends again?

1169
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,798
Of course.

1170
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,515
Come on.

1171
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,478
Let's go be psychos together.

1172
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:08,902
I'm dating Peter now.

1173
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,988
He's in college with Craig.

1174
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:15,826
He's opinionated. We have
intellectual debates.

1175
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:19,996
You were very sweet
but our relationship was too one-sided.

1176
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,833
I know this is hard for you.

1177
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,376
I'm just glad that you're happy.

1178
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:26,378
Okay.

1179
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:34,261
Hey, Craig, Sam will be down. Soon.

1180
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,847
Oy vey. We're gonna miss the movie.

1181
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,391
Yeah, I'll go put some pep in her step.
Don't worry.

1182
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:40,517
Hello?

1183
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:45,730
Hey. Do you wanna get out of here?

1184
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,107
Sure, Patrick.

1185
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,486
I'll tell you something, Charlie...

1186
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:53,446
I feel good. You know what I mean?

1187
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:56,700
Maybe tomorrow I'll take you
to this karaoke place downtown.

1188
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:59,161
And this club off the Strip.
They don't card.

1189
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,246
And the Schenley Park scene.

1190
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,416
You have to see the Fruit Loop
at least one time.

1191
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:20,348
My God. My life is officially
an after-school special.

1192
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:21,892
Son of a bitch!

1193
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:24,352
It really is.

1194
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:26,271
It so is.

1195
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,819
So, you ever hear the
one about Lily Miller?

1196
01:15:32,904 --> 01:15:34,196
I don't know.

1197
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,780
Really?

1198
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,325
I thought your brother would have told you.
It's a classic.

1199
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,076
Maybe.

1200
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,996
Okay, Lily comes here
one night with this guy Parker.

1201
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,917
And this was to be the night
that they were gonna lose their virginity.

1202
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:49,544
So she did it really proper.
She packed a picnic.

1203
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:51,880
Stole a bottle of wine.

1204
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:56,635
Everything was perfect
and they’re just about to "do it."

1205
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,262
When they realize they forgot the condoms.

1206
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:02,515
- So what do you think happened?
- I don't know.

1207
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,309
They did it with one of the sandwich bags.

1208
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,269
Ew!

1209
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:09,940
That's disgusting!

1210
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,566
Yes, it is.

1211
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:13,985
Come on! Let's keep the train rolling.

1212
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:16,321
Suburban legend, Charlie.

1213
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,989
Well...

1214
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:21,076
There's this girl named Second Base Stace.

1215
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,829
And, well, she had boobs in 4th grade.

1216
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:27,082
Mosquito bites. Promising. Go.

1217
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:30,669
And she let some of the guys feel them.

1218
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:34,506
- That's your suburban legend?
- Yeah.

1219
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,008
- Did you at least cop a feel?
- No.

1220
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,719
No. Of course not. You went home...

1221
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:42,514
listened to "Asleep," wrote a poem...

1222
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,641
Fine. Okay. Your turn.

1223
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,564
Yeah. I've got one.

1224
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,318
Well...

1225
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:57,237
there's this one guy.

1226
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:00,073
Queer as a 3-dollar bill.

1227
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:04,035
The guy's father doesn't
know about his son.

1228
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:09,374
So he comes into the basement one night
when he's supposed to be out of town.

1229
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,584
Catches his son with another boy.

1230
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,796
So he starts beating him.

1231
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,883
But not like the slap kind.
Like, the real kind.

1232
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:26,725
And the boyfriend says,
"Stop. You're killing him."

1233
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:30,603
But the son just yells, "Get out."

1234
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:35,108
And eventually...

1235
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:39,571
the boyfriend just did.

1236
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:48,371
Why can't you save anybody?

1237
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,125
I don't know.

1238
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:55,754
Forget it.

1239
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,840
I'm free now, right?

1240
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:02,927
I could meet
the love of my life any second.

1241
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:06,556
Things will be different
now and that's good.

1242
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,933
I just need to meet a good guy.

1243
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:10,977
Yeah.

1244
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,034
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1245
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,162
It's all right.

1246
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:37,295
I've been spending a lot
of time with Patrick.

1247
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,673
He begins every night really excited.

1248
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:44,761
He always says he feels free
and tonight is his destiny.

1249
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:48,515
But after a while he runs out of things
to keep himself numb.

1250
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:53,812
And Sam got her letter from Penn State.

1251
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:02,445
"We will require you to take
our summer session...

1252
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:06,199
at the main campus immediately following
your high school graduation."

1253
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:10,662
She got in, Charlie.

1254
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:27,429
After that, all Patrick could talk about
was college and all their futures.

1255
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:30,014
Alice did get into NYU film school.

1256
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:32,225
Patrick is going to the
University of Washington...

1257
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,979
because he wants to be
near the music in Seattle.

1258
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:41,067
But he wasn't going to leave without
organizing the best senior prank ever.

1259
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,034
Sam is going away right after graduation.

1260
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:52,287
It all feels very exciting.

1261
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,914
I just wish it were happening to me.

1262
01:19:54,999 --> 01:19:59,127
Especially because, ever since I
blacked out in the cafeteria...

1263
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:00,795
it's been getting worse.

1264
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,965
And I can't turn it off this time.

1265
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:08,094
All right, guys, you wanna pass your
copies of Gatsby up to the front, please.

1266
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:10,096
And I know it's the last day...

1267
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:13,933
but if we could keep it to a dull roar,
I'd appreciate it.

1268
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:15,018
Thank you.

1269
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:18,605
Guy. Guys. Thank you for such a great year.

1270
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,565
I had a blast. I hope you did, too.

1271
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,526
And I hope you have
a great time this summer on your vacations.

1272
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:25,904
Now who here is gonna read
for pleasure this summer?

1273
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:32,702
Charlie.

1274
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:33,786
Very good.

1275
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,167
Have a good summer.

1276
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,465
Last day.

1277
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,467
Yeah.

1278
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:51,429
So I know it's none of my business,
but have you decided?

1279
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,432
Are you going to New York?

1280
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:56,559
Well...

1281
01:20:57,645 --> 01:21:00,480
My wife and I like it here.

1282
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:02,815
And I think I might be better
at teaching than writing.

1283
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,694
You know, Charlie, I was thinking that...

1284
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,156
maybe I could still give
you books next year.

1285
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:12,742
Yeah. Yeah.

1286
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,161
I think you could write one of them one day.

1287
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,915
- Really?
- I do.

1288
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,461
You're the best teacher I've ever had.

1289
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,797
Thank you.

1290
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:38,059
10, nine, eight...

1291
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,270
seven, six, five...

1292
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:42,939
four, three, two, one.

1293
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:52,532
Dear friend...

1294
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:55,159
I wanted to tell you about us running.

1295
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:57,036
There was this beautiful sunset.

1296
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,455
And just a few hours
before, everyone I love...

1297
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:02,166
had their last day of high school ever.

1298
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:04,210
I was happy because they were happy...

1299
01:22:04,295 --> 01:22:06,629
even though I counted and I have...

1300
01:22:06,714 --> 01:22:10,925
1,095 days to go.

1301
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:13,428
I kept imagining
what school would be like without them...

1302
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,180
as they were all getting ready
for their prom.

1303
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:19,642
My sister finally decided
to break up with Derek...

1304
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:22,145
and go stag with her girlfriends instead.

1305
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:26,649
And then there was Sam.

1306
01:22:26,734 --> 01:22:30,069
I've looked at her picture
since that night.

1307
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:33,489
I like to see how happy she was
before she knew.

1308
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:37,452
They were in a hotel suite after prom
and the truth came out.

1309
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:41,456
Basically Craig
has been cheating on Sam the whole time.

1310
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,291
When I heard that...

1311
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,960
I kept thinking about the happy girl
in these pictures.

1312
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:49,839
'Cause she doesn't have 1,095 days to go.

1313
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,841
She made it.

1314
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:54,135
This is her time.

1315
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:57,013
And no one should be
able to take that away.

1316
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:00,767
Congratulations.

1317
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:02,769
Charlie. Charlie's here. Guys, group photo.

1318
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,312
We should all take a group photo.

1319
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,397
Ooh! Get against the railing
and try to look suave.

1320
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:08,941
Yep, this is the one.
That's gonna be a great angle.

1321
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,826
At her going away party...

1322
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:22,163
I wanted her to know about that night
we went through the tunnel.

1323
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,165
And how for the first time...

1324
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,292
I felt like I belonged somewhere.

1325
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,630
And tomorrow, she's leaving.

1326
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:33,424
So I wanted to give her a part of me.

1327
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:38,221
Are these all your books, Charlie?

1328
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:49,023
Thanks for staying up with me.

1329
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:51,734
Sure.

1330
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:56,781
My brother said Penn State has this
restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.

1331
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,075
You have to get a grilled
sticky on your first night.

1332
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,494
It's a tradition.

1333
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:03,621
That sounds like fun.

1334
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:04,789
Yeah.

1335
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:10,169
Pretty soon, you'll have
a whole new group of friends, you know.

1336
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:13,798
You won't even think about
this place anymore.

1337
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:17,677
Yes, I will.

1338
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:32,817
Had lunch with Craig today.

1339
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,571
Yeah?

1340
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:39,657
He said he was sorry and that I was right
to break up with him.

1341
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:46,748
I'm driving away
and was feeling so small.

1342
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:52,754
Just asking myself,
"Why do I and everyone I love...

1343
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:55,965
pick people who treat
us like we're nothing?"

1344
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:03,514
We accept the love we think we deserve.

1345
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:12,356
Then why didn't you ever ask me out?

1346
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:20,907
I, um...

1347
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:23,367
I just didn't think that you wanted that.

1348
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,204
Well, what did you want?

1349
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,874
I just want you to be happy.

1350
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,794
Don't you get it, Charlie?

1351
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:36,380
I can't feel that.

1352
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:39,634
It's really sweet and everything, but...

1353
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:42,470
You can’t just sit there
and put everybody's lives ahead of yours...

1354
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,222
and think that counts as love.

1355
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:47,350
I don't want to be somebody's crush.

1356
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:51,312
I want people to like the real me.

1357
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,859
I know who you are, Sam.

1358
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,242
I know I'm quiet.

1359
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:08,371
And I know I should speak more.

1360
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:12,333
But if you knew the things
that were in my head most of the time...

1361
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:15,628
you'd know what it really meant.

1362
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:20,424
How much we're alike...

1363
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,969
and how we've been through the same things.

1364
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,848
And you're not small.

1365
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:28,266
You're beautiful.

1366
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:56,127
What's wrong, Charlie?

1367
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:57,962
Nothing.

1368
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,159
You know I'm gonna call you all the time.

1369
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,620
- We're gonna see each other in New York.
- All the time.

1370
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:34,832
Come on, Sam.

1371
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:18,751
What's wrong, Charlie?

1372
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:23,673
Put your seat belt on.

1373
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:24,882
We'll meet you there.

1374
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:50,241
Don't wake your sister.

1375
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:04,755
It'll be our little secret, okay?

1376
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:10,636
Look, Charlie, she's fast asleep.

1377
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:13,639
Don't wake your sister.

1378
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:25,359
My fault.

1379
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:27,611
It's all my fault.

1380
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,530
It'll be our little secret. Okay?

1381
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:30,781
Stop it.

1382
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,117
Stop.

1383
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:41,333
Stop crying.

1384
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:49,800
This'll be our little secret.

1385
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:58,684
Candace. Your brother's on the phone.

1386
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:02,563
Hello?

1387
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,899
- Hey, Candace.
- Charlie?

1388
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:09,570
Sam and Patrick left,
and I can't stop thinking about something.

1389
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:10,821
Shh. What?

1390
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,156
Candace...

1391
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,785
I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I?

1392
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:17,620
She died getting my birthday present...

1393
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:20,748
so I guess I killed her, right?

1394
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:22,917
I've tried to stop thinking that,
but I can't.

1395
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:24,668
She keeps driving away and dying.

1396
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:26,295
Call the police and send them to my house.

1397
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,130
I can't stop her. I'm crazy again.

1398
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:29,799
No. Charlie, listen to me.

1399
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:31,926
Mom and Dad are gonna be home
with Chris any second.

1400
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:34,303
I’m just thinking...

1401
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:36,597
what if I wanted her to die, Candace?

1402
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:38,849
What? Charlie?

1403
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,059
Charlie!

1404
01:31:15,137 --> 01:31:16,428
Charlie?

1405
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:19,056
I'm Dr. Burton.

1406
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:25,271
Where am I?

1407
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:27,523
Mayview Hospital.

1408
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:34,071
You, — You have to let me go.
My dad can't afford it.

1409
01:31:34,156 --> 01:31:36,157
Don't worry about that.

1410
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:41,162
No. I saw them when I was little...

1411
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:43,497
and I don't want to be a Mayview kid.

1412
01:31:43,582 --> 01:31:45,374
Just tell me how to stop it.

1413
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:46,792
Stop what?

1414
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:49,461
Seeing it.

1415
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:56,093
All their lives all the time.

1416
01:31:57,137 --> 01:31:59,096
How do you stop seeing it?

1417
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:01,056
Seeing what, Charlie?

1418
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:06,729
There is so much pain.

1419
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:11,442
And I don't know how to not notice it.

1420
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:13,360
What's hurting you?

1421
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:14,737
No, not me.

1422
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:19,366
It's them. It's everyone. It never stops.

1423
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:21,660
Do you understand?

1424
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:30,669
What about your Aunt Helen?

1425
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:36,967
What about her?

1426
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:38,594
Do you see her?

1427
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:43,974
Yes.

1428
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:46,060
She had a terrible life.

1429
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,140
God, what am I supposed to...

1430
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:53,317
You said some things
about her in your sleep.

1431
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:55,236
I don't care.

1432
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,820
If you want to get better...

1433
01:32:57,989 --> 01:32:59,657
you have to.

1434
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:07,414
She...

1435
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:11,335
She was insane.

1436
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,545
I'm just sayin'.

1437
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:15,839
She...

1438
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:18,759
Charlie?

1439
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:21,178
You gonna let me help you here?

1440
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:25,432
Okay.

1441
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:29,520
Do you remember anything
before you blacked out?

1442
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,984
I remember leaving Sam's house.

1443
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:38,862
I was walking home. And...

1444
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:42,616
I was in the hospital for a while.

1445
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:47,663
I won't go into detail about all of it.

1446
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:51,959
But I will say there
were some very bad days.

1447
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,712
And some unexpected beautiful days.

1448
01:33:57,716 --> 01:34:01,385
The worst day was the time my doctor
told my mom and dad...

1449
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,387
what Aunt Helen did to me.

1450
01:34:10,228 --> 01:34:11,270
Honey?

1451
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:15,733
I'm so sorry.

1452
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:32,833
The best days were those
when I could have visitors.

1453
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,377
My brother and sister
always came for those...

1454
01:34:35,462 --> 01:34:38,547
until Chris had to go to training camp.

1455
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:40,758
He's going to be first string this year.

1456
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:46,805
My sister told me she met a nice guy
at her summer job.

1457
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:53,270
Here he is.

1458
01:34:53,355 --> 01:34:57,191
So I'll see you Thursday at 6:00, right?

1459
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:59,276
- Okay.
- You gonna hang in there?

1460
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:02,196
My doctor said we can't choose
where we come from...

1461
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,782
but we can choose where we go from there.

1462
01:35:05,992 --> 01:35:07,576
I know it's not all the answers...

1463
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:11,372
but it was enough to start putting
these pieces together.

1464
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:14,384
God bless this food we
are about to receive.

1465
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:15,876
We thank you for this bounty...

1466
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,253
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.

1467
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:20,339
- Amen.
- Amen.

1468
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:31,183
How do you think the Penguins
are gonna do this year, Dad?

1469
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,229
Goddamn Penguins.

1470
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:37,523
Think they're allergic to goddamn defense.

1471
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,195
What do the players call a puck again?

1472
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:45,489
A biscuit.

1473
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,574
Are you sure it's not a "goddamn biscuit"?

1474
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:49,118
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

1475
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:50,994
Honey, I think we're gonna have to do...

1476
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:52,746
a little shopping for you
before you take off?

1477
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:55,582
- Yeah, I need some books.
- Clothes, too.

1478
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:56,834
Yeah.

1479
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:04,174
Can Charlie come out and play?

1480
01:36:10,223 --> 01:36:12,599
The first night, we had grilled stickies.

1481
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:14,059
So good.

1482
01:36:14,144 --> 01:36:15,936
You have to visit in the fall.
We'll have some, okay?

1483
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,104
Definitely.

1484
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,647
Sorry...

1485
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:21,233
Charlie has a breakdown
scheduled for October.

1486
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,695
Well, can I tell you something?

1487
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,030
I've been away for two months.

1488
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,199
It's another world.

1489
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:31,285
And it gets better.

1490
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:34,455
And my roommate Katie
has the best taste in music.

1491
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,713
I found the tunnel song.

1492
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,050
Let's drive.

1493
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,516
I don't know if I will have the time
to write any more letters...

1494
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:57,728
because I might be too busy
trying to participate.

1495
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:03,484
So, if this does end up
being the last letter...

1496
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:07,654
I want you to know that I was in a bad
place before I started high school.

1497
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:10,157
And you helped me.

1498
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:12,493
Even if you didn't know
what I was talking about...

1499
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,828
or know someone who's gone through it.

1500
01:37:14,913 --> 01:37:16,747
You made me not feel alone.

1501
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:23,837
Because I know there are people
who say all these things don't happen.

1502
01:37:23,922 --> 01:37:29,510
There are people who forget what it's like
to be 16 when they turn 17.

1503
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:32,221
I know these will all be stories someday.

1504
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:35,265
And our pictures will
become old photographs.

1505
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:37,851
And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad.

1506
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:43,398
But right now these moments
are not stories.

1507
01:37:43,483 --> 01:37:44,858
This is happening.

1508
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:47,361
I am here.

1509
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:49,029
And I am looking at her.

1510
01:37:49,948 --> 01:37:52,282
And she is so beautiful.

1511
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:04,044
I can see it.

1512
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:07,631
This one moment when you know
you're not a sad story.

1513
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:11,134
You are alive.

1514
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:13,887
You stand up and see the lights
on the buildings...

1515
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:17,099
and everything that makes you wonder.

1516
01:38:17,183 --> 01:38:19,434
And you're listening
to that song on that drive...

1517
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:22,563
with the people you love
most in this world.

1518
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:28,110
And in this moment, I swear...

1519
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:31,780
we are infinite.
