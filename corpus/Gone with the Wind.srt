1
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,901
What do we care if we were expelled?

2
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:56,945
The war's gonna start,
so we would've left anyhow.

3
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:58,906
War! Isn't it exciting, Scarlett?

4
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:01,658
- Those fool Yankees want a war.
We'll show them!

5
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,578
Fiddle-dee-dee. War, war, war!

6
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:07,664
This war talk's spoiling
all the fun at every party.

7
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:10,250
I get so bored I could scream.

8
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,669
Besides, there isn't
going to be any war.

9
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:15,839
Not gonna be any war?
- Of course there'll be a war.

10
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,550
If either of you boys
says "war" once again...

11
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,093
...I'll go in the house.

12
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:23,388
- But, Scarlett!
- Don't you want us to have a war?

13
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,558
Wait a minute, honey, please!
We're sorry.

14
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,812
Well...

15
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,691
But remember, I warned you.

16
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,276
I've got an idea!

17
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:38,946
We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue
at Twelve Oaks.

18
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,615
You're eating barbecue with us,
aren't you?

19
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:44,826
I haven't thought about that yet.
I'll think about that tomorrow.

20
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:46,161
We want all your waltzes.

21
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:48,747
First Brent, then me,
then Brent, and so on.

22
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:51,708
- Promise?
- Why, I'd just love to.

23
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,462
If only I didn't have every one
of them taken already.

24
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:58,465
- You can't do that to us!
- We'll tell you a secret.

25
00:07:58,675 --> 00:07:59,841
A secret? Who by?

26
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:01,718
You know Melanie Hamilton?

27
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,388
Ashley Wilkes' cousin?
She's visiting...

28
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:07,349
That goody-goody!
Who wants to know about her?

29
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,101
Anyway, we heard... They say...

30
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:11,395
Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.

31
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:15,232
- Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
Do we get those waltzes?

32
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:16,900
Of course.

33
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:25,283
- It can't be true! Ashley loves me!
Scarlett!

34
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:29,787
- What's gotten into her?
- Suppose we made her mad?

35
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,708
Where are you going without your
shawl and the night air coming?

36
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,419
How come you didn't ask them
gentlemen to supper?

37
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,879
You got no more manners
than a field hand.

38
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,716
After me and Miss Ellen
done labored with you!

39
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:45,344
Come on in before you catch
your death of dampness.

40
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:48,598
No! I'm going to wait
for Pa to come home.

41
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:50,516
Come on in here!

42
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,351
Come on!

43
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:54,520
Mm-mm-mm!

44
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:08,701
Quitting time!

45
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:11,370
- Who says it's quitting time?
- I said.

46
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:14,708
I's the foreman. I say
when it's quitting time at Tara.

47
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,046
Quitting time!

48
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:03,465
There's none in the county
can touch you, and none in the state.

49
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:05,801
Pa!

50
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,261
How proud of yourself you are!

51
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:14,351
Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,
so you've been spying on me.

52
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:18,105
Like your sister, you'll tell
your mother that I was jumping again.

53
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:20,482
You know I'm no tattletale
like Suellen.

54
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:24,152
But after you broke your knee
last year jumping that fence...

55
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:28,740
I'll not have me own daughter telling me
what I shall jump and not jump.

56
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,409
It's my own neck, so it is.

57
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,786
All right, Pa, you jump what you please.

58
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:35,414
- How are they at Twelve Oaks?
- The Wilkeses?

59
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:39,793
In the stew you'd expect with a barbecue
and talking nothing but war.

60
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:43,088
Bother the war!
Was there anyone else there?

61
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:46,007
Their cousin Melanie
and her brother, Charles.

62
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,636
Melanie Hamilton is a pale-faced,
mealy-mouthed ninny!

63
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:51,263
Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.

64
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:54,349
Ashley Wilkes couldn't like
anyone like her.

65
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:57,894
What's your interest
in Ashley and Miss Melanie?

66
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,731
Nothing. Let's go into the house.

67
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:04,234
Has he been trifling with you?
Has he asked you to marry him?

68
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,736
- No.
- Nor will he.

69
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:08,530
I had it in strict confidence
from John Wilkes today...

70
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,532
...Ashley's going to marry Melanie.

71
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:13,326
It'll be announced
tomorrow night at the ball.

72
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:14,828
I don't believe it!

73
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,706
Here! Where are you off to?

74
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:19,124
Scarlett!

75
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,709
What are you about?

76
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:26,047
Have you been running after a man
who's not in love with you?

77
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:28,008
When you might have any other?

78
00:11:28,217 --> 00:11:31,677
I haven't been running after him,
it's just a surprise.

79
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:34,430
Now, don't be jerking
your chin at me!

80
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:37,975
If Ashley wanted to marry you,
I'd have misgivings.

81
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:41,520
I want my girl to be happy.
You'd not be happy with him.

82
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:42,980
I would! I would!

83
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,401
What's the difference who you marry?
So long as he's a Southerner.

84
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:50,196
And when I'm gone
I'll leave Tara to you.

85
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:52,364
I don't want it.
It doesn't mean anything...

86
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:54,867
Do you mean to tell me,
Katie Scarlett O'Hara...

87
00:11:55,118 --> 00:11:57,203
...that land doesn't mean
anything to you?

88
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,872
Land is the only thing in the
world worth working for...

89
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:01,957
...worth fighting for, worth dying for.

90
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:05,503
- It's the only thing that lasts!
- You talk like an Irishman.

91
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:09,632
It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
Don't you be forgetting...

92
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,133
...that you're half Irish too.

93
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:13,677
To anyone with a drop
of Irish blood in them...

94
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,888
...the land they live on
is like their mother.

95
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,182
But there now. You're just a child.

96
00:12:18,391 --> 00:12:20,518
It'll come to you,
this love of the land.

97
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,604
There's no getting away from it
if you're Irish.

98
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:49,380
Here she comes!

99
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:51,799
Scarlett, Suellen, Carreen,
your mama's home!

100
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,885
Acting like a wet nurse to
them white-trash Slatterys...

101
00:12:55,095 --> 00:12:58,180
...instead of eating her supper.
Set up the fire!

102
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:00,391
Got no business wearing herself out...

103
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,935
Pork! Take the lamp
out on the porch.

104
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:06,397
Wearing herself out.
Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home!

105
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:08,649
Waiting on them poor white trash.

106
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,776
Shut up, dog!
Barking in the house!

107
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:13,445
Get up from there!
Don't you hear Miss Ellen?

108
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:15,990
Get out there and get
her medicine chest!

109
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:18,576
We was worried about you, Miss Ellen.

110
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:21,161
It's all right, Pork. I'm home.

111
00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:25,332
Mrs. O'Hara, we finished
plowing the creek bottom today.

112
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:28,043
What do you want me
to start on tomorrow?

113
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:31,839
Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come
from Emmie Slattery's bedside.

114
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,507
Your child has been born.

115
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:36,927
My child, ma'am?
I'm sure I don't understand.

116
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:40,180
Has been born and
mercifully has died.

117
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:42,433
Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.

118
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:47,688
I fix your supper myself
and you eats it.

119
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:50,566
- Yes, after prayers, Mammy.
- Yes'm.

120
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:54,737
Mr. O'Hara, you must
dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.

121
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:58,533
Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?
He's the best overseer in the county.

122
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:01,411
He must go tomorrow morning,
the first thing!

123
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:04,831
- No.
- Yes.

124
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,335
The Yankee Wilkerson and
the white-trash Slattery girl?

125
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:12,005
- We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
- Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.

126
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,592
Scarlett's dress
is prettier than mine!

127
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,970
Can't she wear my pink dress?
I wanna wear Scarlett's green dress.

128
00:14:19,221 --> 00:14:22,307
I don't like your tone, Suellen.
Your pink gown's lovely.

129
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:25,435
Can't I stay up for the ball?
- You may wear my garnets.

130
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:28,313
Why can't I stay up for
the ball tomorrow?

131
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:33,525
Scarlett. You look tired, my dear.
I'm worried about you.

132
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:35,194
I'm all right, Mother.

133
00:14:35,403 --> 00:14:38,739
Why can't I stay up for the ball?
I'm 13 now.

134
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,283
You may go to the barbecue.

135
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:43,744
I didn't want your tacky dress anyhow!

136
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:46,664
- Hush up!
Prayers, girls.

137
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:57,967
- And to all the saints, that I have
sinned in thought, word and deed...

138
00:14:58,218 --> 00:15:03,180
...through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.

139
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:06,684
Therefore, I beseech thee,
blessed Mary, ever virgin...

140
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:09,103
...blessed Michael the Archangel...

141
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:11,105
...blessed John the Baptist...

142
00:15:11,356 --> 00:15:15,567
...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul,
and all the saints...

143
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:17,152
...pray to the Lord...

144
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:19,613
Ashley doesn't know I love him.

145
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:22,491
I'll tell him that I love him...

146
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:25,035
...and then he can't marry.

147
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:28,372
Hear thee Almighty,
most merciful Lord...

148
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:33,043
...grant us pardon, absolution
and remission of our sins. Amen.

149
00:15:34,004 --> 00:15:35,129
Ooh!

150
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:38,590
Just hold on and suck in!

151
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,093
Mammy, here's
Miss Scarlett's vittles.

152
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:43,846
Take it back to the kitchen.
I won't eat a bite.

153
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:45,431
Yes'm, you is!

154
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:47,599
You's gonna eat every mouthful.

155
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:51,520
No, I'm not!

156
00:15:53,523 --> 00:15:55,482
Put on the dress.
We're late already.

157
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:57,401
- What my lamb gonna wear?
- That.

158
00:15:57,652 --> 00:16:01,530
No, you ain't! You can't show
your bosom before 3:00!

159
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:03,657
I'm gonna speak to your ma!

160
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:06,994
If you say one word to mother,
I won't eat a bite.

161
00:16:10,623 --> 00:16:11,790
Well...

162
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:22,259
Keep your shawl on. I ain't
aiming for you to get freckled...

163
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:26,972
...after the buttermilk I done put
on you, bleaching them freckles.

164
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:37,816
Now, Miss Scarlett. You come on
and be good and eat just a little, honey.

165
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:41,862
No! I'm going to have a good time
today and eat at the barbecue.

166
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,865
If you don't care
what folks says, I does!

167
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:50,204
You can always tell a lady by how
she eats in front of folks like a bird.

168
00:16:50,497 --> 00:16:54,708
I ain't aiming for you to go to
John Wilkes' and gobble like a hog!

169
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:56,418
Fiddle-dee-dee!

170
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:59,963
Ashley told me he likes
girls with a healthy appetite.

171
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:02,883
What gentlemens says
and thinks is different things.

172
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:06,095
And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley
asking for to marry you.

173
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:26,824
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need
a having it come right back up again.

174
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,662
Why is it a girl has to be
so silly to catch a husband?

175
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:35,791
Scarlett O'Hara! If you're not
down here by the time I count 10...

176
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,126
...we'll go without you!
- I'm coming, Pa!

177
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:43,506
One, two, three, four, five...

178
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:46,217
Oh, dear!

179
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:50,805
My stays are so tight, I'll never
get through the day without belching!

180
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:16,497
Well, John Wilkes.

181
00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:20,001
- It's a grand day for the barbecue.
- So it seems, Gerald.

182
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,878
Why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?

183
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:25,673
She's settling accounts with the overseer,
but she'll be along tonight.

184
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:29,552
- Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
- Thank you kindly, India.

185
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:32,889
Your daughter's getting
prettier every day, John.

186
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:35,975
Here are the O'Hara girls.
We must greet them.

187
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:39,438
I can't stand Scarlett.
She throws herself at Ashley.

188
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:41,315
That's your brother's business.

189
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:43,984
You must remember
your duties as hostess.

190
00:18:44,194 --> 00:18:46,737
Good morning, girls.
You're looking lovely.

191
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:48,780
Good morning, Scarlett.

192
00:18:49,407 --> 00:18:52,117
India Wilkes,
what a lovely dress!

193
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:55,037
I just can't take my eyes off it.

194
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:57,539
Good morning, Miss Scarlett.

195
00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:01,293
You look mighty fine
this morning, Miss Scarlett.

196
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:05,672
It's a pleasure to see you,
Miss Scarlett.

197
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:09,635
Ashley!

198
00:19:11,512 --> 00:19:14,223
Scarlett, my dear!

199
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:16,725
I've been looking for you everywhere.

200
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:20,687
I've got something I must tell you.
Can't we go someplace quiet?

201
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:24,483
Yes, I'd like to, but I have
something to tell you too.

202
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:28,320
Something I hope
you'll be glad to hear.

203
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:30,697
Come say hello
to my cousin Melanie first.

204
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:32,574
Oh, do we have to?

205
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:36,578
She's been looking forward
to seeing you again. Melanie!

206
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,500
Here's Scarlett.
- Scarlett!

207
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:44,086
I'm so glad to see you again.

208
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:47,005
Melanie, what a surprise
to run into you here.

209
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:49,466
I hope you'll stay with us a few days.

210
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:53,178
I hope I shall stay long enough
for us to become real friends.

211
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:56,181
- I do want us to be.
- We'll keep her here, won't we?

212
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:59,101
We'll make the biggest fuss over her!

213
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:02,104
If anybody can give a girl
a good time, it's Ashley.

214
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:05,607
Our good times must seem silly
to you. You're so serious.

215
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,568
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.

216
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:11,905
I've always admired you.
I wish I could be more like you.

217
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:14,950
You mustn't flatter me
and say things you don't mean.

218
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:18,745
Nobody could accuse Melanie
of being insincere. Could they, my dear?

219
00:20:18,955 --> 00:20:20,998
She's not like you, is she, Ashley?

220
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:23,500
He never means a word
he says to any girl.

221
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,462
Why, Charles Hamilton,
you handsome old thing, you!

222
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:29,131
But, Miss O'Hara, I...

223
00:20:29,382 --> 00:20:34,219
Was it kind to bring your good-looking
brother here to break my poor heart?

224
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,724
Now that Charles is your beau,
she's after him like a hornet.

225
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:41,268
Charles, I want to eat
barbecue with you.

226
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,104
Don't go philandering with any other girl,
because I'm mighty jealous.

227
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:48,691
I won't, Miss O'Hara.
I couldn't!

228
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:52,987
I do declare, Frank Kennedy! You look
dashing with those new whiskers.

229
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:55,614
Thank you, thank you, Miss Scarlett.

230
00:20:56,074 --> 00:21:01,162
Charles and Wade asked me to eat with
them, but I told them I promised you.

231
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:05,207
You needn't be so amused.
She's after your beau now.

232
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:08,377
That's mighty flattering of you,
Miss Scarlett.

233
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:10,629
I'll see what I can do.

234
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:13,382
Why's your sister mad?
You sparking her beau?

235
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:16,469
As if I couldn't do better
than that old maid in britches.

236
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,096
Brent and Stuart,
you handsome old things!

237
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:22,516
- I didn't mean it. I'm mad at you!
- What have we done?

238
00:21:22,768 --> 00:21:26,312
You haven't been near me all day!
I wore this old dress for you.

239
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:28,356
I was counting on eating with you.

240
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:31,275
- You are, Scarlett.
- Of course you are, honey.

241
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:35,029
I never can make up my mind
which of you is the handsomest.

242
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,657
I was awake all last night
trying to figure it out.

243
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:40,451
Oh, shucks!

244
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:46,665
- Cathleen, who's that?
- Who?

245
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,043
That man looking at us and smiling.

246
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:50,419
The nasty dark one.

247
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,590
Don't you know? That's Rhett Butler.
He's from Charleston.

248
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:57,343
He has a most terrible reputation.

249
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:05,684
He looks as if he knows
what I look like without my shimmy.

250
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:08,437
My dear, he isn't received.

251
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:12,566
He spends his time up North
because his folks won't speak to him.

252
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:15,069
He was expelled
from West Point, he's so fast.

253
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:18,322
And there's that business
about the girl he wouldn't marry.

254
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:19,657
Tell, tell!

255
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:24,912
He took her out buggy-riding in
the late afternoon without a chaperon...

256
00:22:25,455 --> 00:22:28,207
...and then he refused to marry her!

257
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,255
No, but she was ruined just the same.

258
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,428
Ashley...

259
00:22:40,637 --> 00:22:43,639
- Happy?
- So happy.

260
00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:46,767
You seem to belong here...

261
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,687
...as if it had all been
imagined for you.

262
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:53,315
I like to feel that I belong
to the things you love.

263
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:56,444
- You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
- Yes, Ashley.

264
00:22:56,653 --> 00:23:00,322
I love it as more than a house.

265
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:04,285
It's a whole world that wants only
to be graceful and beautiful.

266
00:23:04,536 --> 00:23:08,372
It's so unaware
that it may not last forever.

267
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:11,792
You're afraid of what may happen
if the war comes?

268
00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:14,962
But we don't have to be afraid for us.

269
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:18,466
No war can come into our world, Ashley.

270
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:21,803
Whatever comes, I'll love you...

271
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:26,183
...just as I do now, until I die.

272
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:32,022
Isn't this better than a table?

273
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:35,150
A girl hasn't got but two sides
to her at a table.

274
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:38,069
- I'll get her dessert.
- She said me!

275
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,529
Allow me, Miss O'Hara?

276
00:23:41,908 --> 00:23:43,909
I think...

277
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,913
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.

278
00:23:50,874 --> 00:23:54,210
Thank you, Miss O'Hara.
Thank you!

279
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,463
Go get it, boy!
Isn't he the luckiest...

280
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,847
Miss O'Hara...

281
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:09,350
...I love you.

282
00:24:10,393 --> 00:24:13,103
I don't guess I'm as hungry
as I thought.

283
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:18,984
Why do I have to take a nap?
I'm not tired.

284
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:21,445
Well-brought-up ladies
takes naps at parties.

285
00:24:21,655 --> 00:24:25,324
It's time you behave and act
like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.

286
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:29,495
When we were in Saratoga,
I didn't see Yankee girls taking naps.

287
00:24:29,704 --> 00:24:32,957
And you won't see no Yankee
girls at the ball, neither.

288
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,625
How was Ashley today?

289
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:37,336
He didn't pay much attention to you.

290
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:39,046
You mind your own business!

291
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:41,674
You'll be lucky you don't lose
whisker-face Kennedy.

292
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:45,427
You're sweet on Ashley, and his
engagement's being announced tonight.

293
00:24:45,637 --> 00:24:47,513
That's as much as you know.

294
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:52,351
You ought to behave yourself!
Acting like poor white-trash children!

295
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:55,396
If you's old enough for parties,
you should act like ladies!

296
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:57,189
Who cares?

297
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:50,534
We've borne enough insults
from the Yankees.

298
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:54,872
We'll keep our slaves
with or without their approval.

299
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:58,667
'Twas the sovereign right of
Georgia to secede from the Union.

300
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:01,670
The South must assert herself
by force of arms.

301
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:06,050
After we've fired on the Yankee rascals
at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight.

302
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:08,469
- There's no other way.
That's right!

303
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,596
Let the Yankees ask for peace.

304
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:15,184
The situation's very simple.
The Yankees can't fight and we can.

305
00:26:15,393 --> 00:26:18,062
There won't be a battle.
They'll turn and run.

306
00:26:18,313 --> 00:26:22,149
One of us can lick 20 Yanks.
We'll beat them in one battle.

307
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,735
Gentlemen can always fight
better than rabble.

308
00:26:24,903 --> 00:26:26,278
Gentlemen always fight better.

309
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:28,864
What does the captain
of our Troop say?

310
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:33,285
Well, gentlemen,
if Georgia fights, I go with her.

311
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:36,580
I hope the Yankees let us
leave the Union in peace.

312
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:38,290
Ashley, they've insulted us!

313
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,376
You can't mean you don't want war?

314
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:43,754
Most of the miseries of the world
were caused by wars.

315
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:48,884
And when the wars were over,
no one ever knew what they were about.

316
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:53,596
Now, gentlemen. Mr. Butler's
been up North, I hear.

317
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:55,223
Don't you agree with us?

318
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:58,935
I think it's hard winning
a war with words.

319
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:00,395
What do you mean, sir?

320
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:03,147
There's not a cannon factory
in the whole South.

321
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:05,358
What difference does that make
to a gentleman?

322
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:08,528
It'll make a great difference
to a great many gentlemen, sir.

323
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:11,489
Are you hinting
that the Yankees can lick us?

324
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,865
No, I'm not hinting.

325
00:27:13,117 --> 00:27:15,827
I'm saying plainly, the Yankees
are better equipped than we.

326
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:18,246
They've got factories,
shipyards, coal mines...

327
00:27:18,455 --> 00:27:21,207
...and a fleet to bottle up
our harbors and starve us.

328
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:25,002
All we've got is cotton and slaves,
and arrogance.

329
00:27:25,254 --> 00:27:27,922
I refuse to listen
to any renegade talk!

330
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:32,468
- I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
- Apologies aren't enough, sir.

331
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:35,304
I hear you were turned out
of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler.

332
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:38,141
And you aren't received in
any family in Charleston.

333
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:39,559
Not even your own!

334
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:47,692
I apologize again
for all my shortcomings.

335
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:51,654
Perhaps you won't mind if
I look over your place?

336
00:27:51,864 --> 00:27:55,241
I seem to be spoiling everybody's
brandy and cigars...

337
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:57,243
...and dreams of victory.

338
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:07,421
That's what you can expect
from somebody like Rhett Butler.

339
00:28:07,672 --> 00:28:09,381
You did everything but call him out.

340
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:11,884
- He refused to fight.
- Not quite there, Charles.

341
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:14,803
- He refused to take advantage of you.
- Take advantage of me?

342
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:18,098
He's one of the best shots in the country,
as he's proved many times.

343
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:20,976
- He's got steadier hands than yours.
- Well, I'll show him!

344
00:28:21,144 --> 00:28:23,687
Please. Don't go tweaking
his nose anymore.

345
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,899
You may be needed for more
important fighting.

346
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:29,401
If you'll excuse me,
Mr. Butler's our guest.

347
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:31,904
I think I'll just show him around.

348
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:45,709
Ashley!

349
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:54,676
Ashley...

350
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:56,386
Scarlett.

351
00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:00,057
Who are you hiding from in here?

352
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,147
What are you up to?

353
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:12,569
Why aren't you upstairs,
resting with the other girls?

354
00:29:13,488 --> 00:29:15,364
What is this, Scarlett, a secret?

355
00:29:16,032 --> 00:29:17,366
Oh, Ashley...

356
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:18,742
Ashley!

357
00:29:18,993 --> 00:29:21,370
- I love you.
- Scarlett!

358
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:23,831
I love you, I do!

359
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:28,877
Isn't it enough that you gathered
every other man's heart today?

360
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:31,421
You've always had mine.
You cut your teeth on it.

361
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:33,048
Don't tease me now.

362
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:36,134
Have I your heart, my darling?
I love you, I love you!

363
00:29:36,386 --> 00:29:38,220
You mustn't say such things.

364
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:40,097
You'll hate me for hearing them.

365
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:43,976
I could never hate you,
and I know you must care about me.

366
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:46,979
You do care, don't you?

367
00:29:47,856 --> 00:29:50,274
Yes, I care.

368
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:55,529
Can't we go away
and forget we ever said these things?

369
00:29:56,905 --> 00:29:58,656
But how can we do that?

370
00:29:58,824 --> 00:30:01,075
Don't you...?
Don't you want to marry me?

371
00:30:01,243 --> 00:30:02,785
I'm going to marry Melanie.

372
00:30:02,995 --> 00:30:05,329
But you can't!
Not if you care for me!

373
00:30:05,581 --> 00:30:08,875
Oh, my dear, why must you make me
say things that will hurt you?

374
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:11,794
How can I make you understand?

375
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:15,172
You're so young, you don't
know what marriage means.

376
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:17,758
I know I love you,
and I want to be your wife.

377
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,427
You don't love Melanie.

378
00:30:19,678 --> 00:30:21,220
She's like me, Scarlett.

379
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:23,890
She's my blood
and we understand each other.

380
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,392
But you love me!

381
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:28,477
How could I help loving you?

382
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:30,980
You have all the passion
for life that I lack.

383
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:35,693
That kind of love isn't enough
for two people as different as we are.

384
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:38,946
Why not say it, you coward?
You're afraid to marry me.

385
00:30:39,197 --> 00:30:41,449
You'd marry that fool
who can only say...

386
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:45,036
..."yes," "no" and raise
a passel of mealy-mouthed brats!

387
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:46,412
You mustn't say that!

388
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:49,415
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
You led me on!

389
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:52,668
- You made me believe you'd marry me.
- Scarlett, be fair!

390
00:30:52,878 --> 00:30:55,463
- I never at any time...
- You did! It's true, you did!

391
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:57,506
I'll hate you till I die!

392
00:30:57,758 --> 00:31:01,427
I can't think of anything
bad enough to call you!

393
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:29,372
Has the war started?

394
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:34,043
Sir, you should have made
your presence known.

395
00:31:34,378 --> 00:31:36,587
In the middle of that
beautiful love scene?

396
00:31:36,797 --> 00:31:38,881
That wouldn't have been tactful,
would it?

397
00:31:39,091 --> 00:31:41,842
But don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

398
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:45,846
- Sir, you are no gentleman.
- And you, miss, are no lady.

399
00:31:46,056 --> 00:31:49,642
I don't hold that against you.
Ladies never held any charm for me.

400
00:31:49,893 --> 00:31:52,603
First you take advantage of me,
then you insult me!

401
00:31:52,854 --> 00:31:54,438
I meant it as a compliment.

402
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,943
I hope to see more of you, when
you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.

403
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:02,279
He doesn't strike me as good
enough for a girl of your...

404
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:05,157
What was it?
Your "passion for living. "

405
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:07,743
How dare you!
You aren't fit to wipe his boots!

406
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:12,873
And you were going to hate him
for the rest of your life.

407
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:18,754
She certainly made a fool
of herself running after all the men.

408
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:20,423
That's not fair, India.

409
00:32:20,674 --> 00:32:23,551
She's so attractive,
men naturally flock to her.

410
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,886
Melanie, you're just too good to be true.

411
00:32:26,138 --> 00:32:29,765
- Didn't you see her going after Charles?
- And she knows Charles belongs to me.

412
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:31,475
You're wrong, India.

413
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:34,812
Scarlett's just high-spirited
and vivacious.

414
00:32:35,272 --> 00:32:38,024
Men flirt with girls like that,
but they don't marry them.

415
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:40,818
I think you're being very mean to her.

416
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:09,096
Miss O'Hara!

417
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:12,349
Mr. Lincoln's called volunteers
to fight against us!

418
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,061
Don't you men think
about anything important?

419
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:19,148
But it's war! Everybody's going off
to enlist. I'm going too!

420
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:21,067
Everybody?

421
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:27,364
Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?

422
00:33:27,616 --> 00:33:28,866
To see us go?

423
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:31,702
I'll cry into my pillow every night.

424
00:33:31,912 --> 00:33:33,662
Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.

425
00:33:33,872 --> 00:33:38,209
You're the most beautiful girl in the world,
and the sweetest, the dearest.

426
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,711
I couldn't hope that you could love me.

427
00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:44,381
I'm so clumsy and stupid
and not nearly good enough for you.

428
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:48,260
But if you could think of marrying me,
I'd do anything in the world for you.

429
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:49,595
Just anything, I promise.

430
00:33:50,472 --> 00:33:51,514
What did you say?

431
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:55,267
Miss O'Hara, I said,
"Would you marry me?"

432
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:02,775
Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.

433
00:34:02,984 --> 00:34:05,528
You will? You'll marry me?
You'll wait for me?

434
00:34:05,737 --> 00:34:09,448
- I don't think I'd want to wait.
- You'll marry me before I go?

435
00:34:09,866 --> 00:34:13,285
Oh, Miss O'Hara! Scarlett.

436
00:34:15,372 --> 00:34:17,998
- When may I speak to your father?
- The sooner the better.

437
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:22,586
I'll go now, I can't wait.
Will you excuse me, dear?

438
00:34:24,297 --> 00:34:25,714
Dear!

439
00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:28,467
Mr. O'Hara! Mr. O'Hara!

440
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:33,013
- It'll be a week before they call me.
- A week till they take you away from me!

441
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,702
Oh, Ashley.

442
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:09,175
I thought of you
at our wedding yesterday...

443
00:35:09,384 --> 00:35:11,635
...and I hoped yours
would be as beautiful.

444
00:35:11,887 --> 00:35:14,513
- And it was!
- Was it?

445
00:35:14,723 --> 00:35:17,558
Now we're really and truly sisters.

446
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:19,268
- Charles!
- Melanie.

447
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:28,485
Don't cry, darling.

448
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:33,073
The war will be over in a few weeks,
and I'll be coming back to you.

449
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:18,534
Miss Scarlett!

450
00:36:18,786 --> 00:36:21,871
I don't care!
I'm too young to be a widow.

451
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:23,456
Miss Scarlett!

452
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:28,586
Why, I'd just go around
scaring people in that thing.

453
00:36:28,837 --> 00:36:31,256
You shouldn't be around people.
You's in mourning!

454
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:34,217
For what? I don't feel anything.

455
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:37,387
Why should I have to
pretend and pretend?

456
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:39,722
What is it?

457
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,142
Oh, poor baby!

458
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,602
What is it?

459
00:36:44,812 --> 00:36:46,479
My life is over!

460
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,858
- Nothing will ever happen to me anymore!
- Darling...

461
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:54,862
Oh, Mother,
I know you think I'm horrible.

462
00:36:55,114 --> 00:36:57,573
But I just can't bear
going around in black.

463
00:36:57,825 --> 00:37:01,911
It's bad enough not being able to
go to parties. But looking this way too?

464
00:37:02,162 --> 00:37:03,830
I don't think you're at all horrible.

465
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:08,418
It's only natural you want to look young
and be young when you are young.

466
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:10,920
Oh, baby!

467
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:14,424
How would you like to visit somewhere?
Savannah, perhaps?

468
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:17,385
What would I do in Savannah?

469
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:20,888
Well, Atlanta then.
There's lots going on there.

470
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:24,225
And you can stay with Melanie
and her Aunt Pittypat.

471
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:26,269
Melanie?

472
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,645
Yes.

473
00:37:28,272 --> 00:37:29,480
Yes, I could, couldn't I?

474
00:37:29,732 --> 00:37:32,818
Oh, Mother, you're sweeter
than anybody in the world!

475
00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:34,486
You'd like it, really?

476
00:37:34,738 --> 00:37:39,033
All right, then.
Now stop your crying and smile.

477
00:37:39,701 --> 00:37:41,910
You can take Prissy with you.

478
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,496
Start packing
Miss Scarlett's things, Mammy.

479
00:37:44,748 --> 00:37:47,374
I'll go write the necessary letters.

480
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:50,753
Atlanta!

481
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:54,381
Savannah would be better for you.
You'll get in trouble in Atlanta.

482
00:37:54,632 --> 00:37:55,841
What are you talking about?

483
00:37:56,092 --> 00:37:59,470
You know what I's talking about.
I'm talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes.

484
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,974
He'll come to Atlanta for his leave
and you waiting for him just like a spider!

485
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:07,811
- He belongs to Miss Melanie...
- Go pack my things like Mother said!

486
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:31,293
They're all whispering,
and I know it's about her!

487
00:38:31,544 --> 00:38:33,587
What's it matter, Pittypat?

488
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,758
Scarlett's living under my roof,
so they think I'm responsible for her.

489
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:41,845
And for a widow to appear in public
at a social gathering...

490
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:44,723
...every time I think of it, I feel faint.

491
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:49,103
You know Scarlett came here
only to help raise money for the Cause.

492
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:52,272
It was splendid of her
to make the sacrifice.

493
00:38:52,524 --> 00:38:57,653
Anyone hearing you talk would think
she came to dance instead of sell things.

494
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,919
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have important news! Glorious news!

495
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,714
Another triumph
for our magnificent men in arms!

496
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,884
General Lee has completely
whipped the enemy...

497
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:26,139
...and swept the Yankee army
northward from Virginia!

498
00:39:35,274 --> 00:39:38,568
And now, a happy surprise
for all of us.

499
00:39:38,819 --> 00:39:43,239
We have with us tonight, that most
daring of all blockade runners...

500
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,784
...whose fleet schooners,
slipping past the Yankee guns...

501
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:50,997
...have brought us here the very
woolens and laces we wear tonight.

502
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:55,251
I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that
will-o'- the-wisp of the bounding main.

503
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:58,129
None other than our friend
from Charleston...

504
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,131
...Captain Rhett Butler!

505
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:22,320
Permit me.

506
00:40:26,575 --> 00:40:29,869
Captain Butler, such a pleasure
to see you again.

507
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,954
I met you last at my husband's home.

508
00:40:32,206 --> 00:40:34,665
That's kind of you to remember,
Mrs. Wilkes.

509
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:37,460
Did you meet Captain Butler
at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?

510
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:39,795
Yes, I... I think so.

511
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:42,381
Only for a moment.
It was in the library.

512
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:44,884
You had broken something.

513
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:48,179
Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.

514
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:52,141
Ladies, the Confederacy asks for your
jewelry on behalf of our noble Cause.

515
00:40:52,392 --> 00:40:54,435
We aren't wearing any.
We're in mourning.

516
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:55,978
Wait.

517
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:59,357
On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes
and Mrs. Hamilton.

518
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,942
Thank you, Captain Butler.

519
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:03,528
Just a moment, please.

520
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,907
But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.

521
00:41:08,116 --> 00:41:11,786
It may help my husband more
off my finger.

522
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:13,538
Thank you.

523
00:41:15,457 --> 00:41:17,625
That was a very beautiful thing to do.

524
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,835
Here.

525
00:41:20,087 --> 00:41:22,463
You can have mine too.
For the Cause.

526
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:28,511
And you, Mrs. Hamilton.
I know just how much that means to you.

527
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:29,720
Melanie?

528
00:41:29,972 --> 00:41:32,139
- Dr. Meade?
- I need your approval...

529
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:35,268
...for something we want to do
that's rather shocking.

530
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:37,353
Will you excuse us?

531
00:41:39,982 --> 00:41:43,609
I'll say one thing. The war makes
the most peculiar widows.

532
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:44,860
I wish you'd go away!

533
00:41:45,112 --> 00:41:48,364
If you had any raising, you'd know
I'd never want to see you again!

534
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:52,577
Now, why be silly?

535
00:41:52,828 --> 00:41:54,412
You've no reason for hating me.

536
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:57,748
I'll carry your guilty secret
to my grave.

537
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:02,336
I'd be very unpatriotic to hate
a great hero of the war.

538
00:42:02,546 --> 00:42:05,881
I declare, I was surprised you
turned out to be a noble character.

539
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:09,427
I can't bear to take advantage
of your little-girl ideas.

540
00:42:09,678 --> 00:42:11,762
I'm neither noble nor heroic.

541
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:15,725
- But you are a blockade runner?
- For profit, and profit only.

542
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,685
You don't believe in the Cause?

543
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:22,106
Rhett Butler is the only cause I know.
The rest doesn't mean much to me.

544
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:27,361
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

545
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:30,573
...I have a startling surprise
for the benefit of the hospital.

546
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:36,579
Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the reel
with the lady of your choice...

547
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,164
...you must bid for her!

548
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:44,712
Caroline Meade, how can you let your
husband conduct this slave auction!

549
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:47,673
Darlene Merriwether,
how dare you criticize me!

550
00:42:47,883 --> 00:42:52,261
Melanie told the doctor that
if it's for the Cause, it's quite all right.

551
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:53,471
She did?

552
00:42:53,722 --> 00:42:56,974
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Where are my smelling salts?

553
00:42:57,184 --> 00:43:00,811
- I think I shall faint.
- Don't you dare faint, Pittypat!

554
00:43:01,021 --> 00:43:04,607
If Melanie says it's all right,
it is all right.

555
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:07,860
Come, gentlemen,
do I hear your bids? Make your offers!

556
00:43:08,528 --> 00:43:10,529
Don't be bashful, gentlemen!

557
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:15,284
Twenty dollars! Twenty dollars
for Miss Maybelle Merriwether!

558
00:43:15,535 --> 00:43:17,411
Twenty-five dollars
for Miss Fanny Elsing!

559
00:43:17,663 --> 00:43:19,330
Only $25 to give your...

560
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:23,459
- One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.
- For what lady, sir?

561
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,461
For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

562
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:31,592
- For whom, sir?
- Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

563
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,803
Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning.

564
00:43:34,054 --> 00:43:36,806
But I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles
would be proud to...

565
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:40,059
Dr. Meade, I said
Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

566
00:43:40,936 --> 00:43:42,603
She will not consider it, sir.

567
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,897
Oh, yes, I will!

568
00:43:47,317 --> 00:43:49,735
My goodness gracious!

569
00:43:54,157 --> 00:43:56,659
Ooh! Ooh!

570
00:43:57,494 --> 00:43:59,662
Choose your partners
for the Virginia reel!

571
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:03,124
We've shocked the Confederacy.

572
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,167
It's like blockade running, isn't it?

573
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:08,504
It's worse. I expect
a very fancy profit out of it.

574
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:11,757
I don't care what you expect.
I'm gonna dance and dance!

575
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:15,594
Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing
with Abe Lincoln himself!

576
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,378
Another dance and my reputation
will be lost forever.

577
00:44:49,546 --> 00:44:51,881
With enough courage
you can do without a reputation.

578
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,049
Oh, you do talk scandalous!

579
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:04,226
You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.

580
00:45:04,478 --> 00:45:08,189
Don't start flirting with me.
I'm not one of your plantation beaus.

581
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,399
I want more than flirting from you.

582
00:45:11,151 --> 00:45:12,985
What do you want?

583
00:45:13,236 --> 00:45:18,199
I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take
that Southern belle simper off your face.

584
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,744
Someday I want you to say to me the
words I heard you say to Ashley Wilkes.

585
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:24,746
"I love you. "

586
00:45:24,997 --> 00:45:28,792
That's something you'll never hear
from me as long as you live.

587
00:45:49,104 --> 00:45:53,858
How sweet. How kind.
He is a thoughtful gentleman.

588
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:57,987
Why doesn't he say
something about my sacrifice?

589
00:46:02,868 --> 00:46:05,245
Oh. Oh!

590
00:46:05,788 --> 00:46:07,539
Oh, the darling thing!

591
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:09,791
Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely!

592
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:13,002
You didn't really bring it
all the way from Paris just for me.

593
00:46:13,212 --> 00:46:17,090
Yes, I thought it was about time
I got you out of that fake mourning.

594
00:46:17,258 --> 00:46:20,176
Next trip I'll bring you some
green silk for a frock to match it.

595
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,804
- Oh, Rhett.
- It's my duty to our...

596
00:46:23,055 --> 00:46:27,433
...brave boys at the front to
keep our girls at home looking pretty.

597
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:29,894
It's so long since I had anything new!

598
00:46:40,406 --> 00:46:42,156
How do I look?

599
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,492
Awful! Just awful!

600
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:46,119
Why? What's the matter?

601
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,748
This war's stopped being a joke when
a girl doesn't know the latest fashion.

602
00:46:56,256 --> 00:46:59,717
Oh, Rhett! Let me do it.

603
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,892
But, Rhett, I don't know
how I'd dare wear it!

604
00:47:08,143 --> 00:47:09,727
You will, though.

605
00:47:10,103 --> 00:47:12,479
And another thing, those pantalets!

606
00:47:12,689 --> 00:47:15,399
I don't know a woman in Paris
who wears pantalets anymore.

607
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:19,278
What do they...? You shouldn't
talk about such things.

608
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:23,115
You don't mind my knowing about them,
just my talking about them.

609
00:47:23,325 --> 00:47:26,869
I can't go on accepting these gifts,
though you're awfully kind.

610
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,913
I'm not kind. I'm tempting you.

611
00:47:29,122 --> 00:47:32,833
I never give without expecting
something in return. I always get paid.

612
00:47:33,043 --> 00:47:35,210
I won't marry you
to pay for the bonnet.

613
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:38,547
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not a marrying man.

614
00:47:38,798 --> 00:47:41,634
Well, I won't kiss you for it either.

615
00:47:51,728 --> 00:47:53,938
Open your eyes and look at me.

616
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,774
No, I don't think I will kiss you.

617
00:47:56,942 --> 00:47:58,484
Although you need kissing, badly.

618
00:47:58,652 --> 00:48:01,445
That's what's wrong with you.
You should be kissed, and often.

619
00:48:01,655 --> 00:48:03,072
And by someone who knows how.

620
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:05,616
And I suppose you think
you're the proper person!

621
00:48:05,867 --> 00:48:08,994
I might be, if the right moment
ever came.

622
00:48:09,204 --> 00:48:11,914
You're a conceited,
black-hearted varmint!

623
00:48:12,165 --> 00:48:14,583
I don't know why
I let you come and see me.

624
00:48:15,043 --> 00:48:16,377
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.

625
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:21,090
I'm the only man over 16 and under 60
who's around to show you a good time.

626
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:23,883
But cheer up.
The war can't last much longer.

627
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,760
Really, Rhett? Why?

628
00:48:26,011 --> 00:48:28,972
There's a battle going on now
that ought to fix things...

629
00:48:29,181 --> 00:48:30,848
...one way or the other.
- Oh, Rhett.

630
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,725
Is Ashley in it?

631
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:37,105
So you haven't gotten the wooden-headed
Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.

632
00:48:37,356 --> 00:48:40,692
- Yes, I suppose he's in it.
- But tell me, where is it?

633
00:48:40,943 --> 00:48:44,821
Some little town in Pennsylvania
called Gettysburg.

634
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:16,728
Casualty lists! Casualty lists!

635
00:49:21,483 --> 00:49:24,444
Please! Please!

636
00:50:05,527 --> 00:50:09,405
Here you is. They was fighting
for them so, it got tore in half.

637
00:50:09,656 --> 00:50:11,157
Scarlett, you look.

638
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,076
The W's at the end.

639
00:50:16,455 --> 00:50:21,375
Wellman, Wendel, White, Whitman,
Wilkens, Williams, Woolsey, Wortman...

640
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,504
Scarlett, you've passed him!

641
00:50:24,713 --> 00:50:27,256
He isn't there! He isn't there!

642
00:50:27,508 --> 00:50:29,717
Ashley's safe, he isn't listed!

643
00:50:29,968 --> 00:50:33,054
Oh, he's safe. He's safe!

644
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:39,102
Scarlett, you're so sweet to worry
about Ashley like this for me.

645
00:50:45,234 --> 00:50:47,443
I must go to her.

646
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,863
Don't, my dear. Not here.

647
00:50:51,073 --> 00:50:52,865
Let's go home.

648
00:50:53,742 --> 00:50:55,368
Dr. Meade, not...?

649
00:50:55,577 --> 00:50:58,746
Yes, our boy Darcy.

650
00:50:58,997 --> 00:51:02,041
I was making these mittens for him.

651
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,544
He won't need them now.

652
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,462
Well, I'm gonna enlist.

653
00:51:06,713 --> 00:51:08,923
I'll show them!
I'll kill those Yankees!

654
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:10,216
You hush your mouth.

655
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:14,637
You think it'll help your mother
to have you shot too? It's silly!

656
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,933
It's a black day, Scarlett.

657
00:51:19,184 --> 00:51:20,601
Haven't had bad news, have you?

658
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:23,771
- Ashley's safe.
- I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.

659
00:51:24,022 --> 00:51:25,314
There are so many others.

660
00:51:25,566 --> 00:51:28,316
- Any of your friends?
- About every family in the county.

661
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:31,027
- The Tarleton boys, both of them.
- Yes.

662
00:51:31,737 --> 00:51:34,573
Look at them.
All these poor tragic people.

663
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:38,786
The South's sinking to its knees.
It'll never rise again.

664
00:51:39,037 --> 00:51:40,329
The Cause.

665
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:43,791
The cause of living in the past
is dying right in front of us.

666
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:45,877
I never heard you talk like that.

667
00:51:46,086 --> 00:51:51,048
I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry
and that's what this is, sheer waste!

668
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:54,051
But don't you be downcast.

669
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:57,930
Ashley's still alive to come home
to the women who love him.

670
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,599
Both of them.

671
00:52:36,303 --> 00:52:37,595
You're here!

672
00:52:41,266 --> 00:52:44,560
Oh, you're here!
You're really here at last!

673
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,729
Oh, my dear, I've waited so long!

674
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,190
Melanie, my dear, my darling wife!

675
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:55,488
But we're forgetting Scarlett.

676
00:52:56,531 --> 00:52:58,616
Scarlett, dear.

677
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:04,497
Why, is this any way to greet
a returning warrior?

678
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,332
Ashley, I...

679
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:08,417
I...

680
00:53:09,461 --> 00:53:11,754
Merry Christmas, Ashley.

681
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:23,432
Come on, old gentleman, come on.
We's ate all your wives.

682
00:53:24,226 --> 00:53:25,977
We's ate all your little chicks.

683
00:53:26,228 --> 00:53:28,854
You got nobody to worry
your head about leaving.

684
00:53:29,898 --> 00:53:33,025
Come on. Now you just
stand still so you...

685
00:53:33,235 --> 00:53:35,319
...can be Christmas
for the white folks.

686
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,280
Now, hold on!

687
00:53:37,823 --> 00:53:39,240
Hold on!

688
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,033
Don't go getting so uppity.

689
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,704
Even if you is the last chicken
in Atlanta.

690
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,708
Let's not talk about the war.

691
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:52,545
Let's talk Twelve Oaks and Tara
and times before there was a war.

692
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,088
Could we have the wine?

693
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:56,590
Why did you say there
wasn't enough?

694
00:53:56,883 --> 00:54:00,386
There's plenty. It's the very last
of my father's fine Madeira.

695
00:54:00,595 --> 00:54:04,348
He got it from his uncle
Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...

696
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:08,060
...who married his cousin
Jessica Carroll of Carrolton...

697
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:11,647
...who was his second cousin
and akin to the Wilkeses too.

698
00:54:11,898 --> 00:54:15,693
I saved it to wish Ashley
a merry Christmas.

699
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:21,198
But you mustn't drink it all at once,
because it is the last.

700
00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:27,455
I meant it, my dear.
It was a lovely Christmas gift.

701
00:54:27,706 --> 00:54:29,874
Only generals have tunics like this.

702
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,751
I'm so happy you like it.

703
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,543
Where did you get the cloth?

704
00:54:33,794 --> 00:54:35,795
It was sent by a Charleston lady.

705
00:54:36,047 --> 00:54:40,383
I nursed her son while he was
in the hospital before he died and...

706
00:54:40,885 --> 00:54:43,303
You will take good care of it, won't you?

707
00:54:43,512 --> 00:54:46,848
You won't let it get torn.
Promise me.

708
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:48,516
You mustn't worry.

709
00:54:48,768 --> 00:54:52,896
I'll bring it back to you
without any holes in it. I promise.

710
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:58,526
Good night, my dear.
- Good night, Scarlett, darling.

711
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,792
Uncle Peter, is it time
for Mr. Ashley to leave?

712
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:15,627
Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.

713
00:55:15,836 --> 00:55:19,381
Melanie isn't going to the depot?
She hasn't changed her mind?

714
00:55:19,548 --> 00:55:21,007
No, ma'am, she's laying down.

715
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:25,845
She's so upset, Mr. Wilkes told her
she can't even come downstairs.

716
00:55:31,811 --> 00:55:33,019
Ashley...

717
00:55:37,149 --> 00:55:39,818
Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.

718
00:55:40,194 --> 00:55:43,363
Scarlett, I'd rather remember
you as you are now.

719
00:55:43,614 --> 00:55:45,865
Not shivering at the depot.

720
00:55:46,158 --> 00:55:47,534
All right.

721
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:51,287
Ashley, I've got a present for you too!

722
00:55:57,711 --> 00:56:00,255
Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful!

723
00:56:00,464 --> 00:56:02,757
Tie it on me, my dear.

724
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:07,554
While Melly was making a new tunic,
I made this to go with it.

725
00:56:07,805 --> 00:56:09,848
You made it yourself?

726
00:56:10,057 --> 00:56:12,767
Well, then I shall
value it all the more.

727
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:16,521
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

728
00:56:17,231 --> 00:56:19,023
There's something you can do for me.

729
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:20,525
What is it?

730
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:23,195
Will you look after Melanie for me?

731
00:56:23,822 --> 00:56:27,491
She's so frail and gentle,
and she loves you so much.

732
00:56:27,742 --> 00:56:30,744
- If I were killed...
- You mustn't say that! It's bad luck.

733
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:32,621
Say a prayer, quickly.

734
00:56:32,873 --> 00:56:34,874
You say one for me.

735
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:38,752
We shall need all our prayers.
Now the end is coming.

736
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:41,755
- The end?
- The end of the war...

737
00:56:42,382 --> 00:56:44,884
...and the end of our world, Scarlett.

738
00:56:45,594 --> 00:56:48,429
But you don't think
the Yankees are beating us?

739
00:56:48,597 --> 00:56:52,266
Oh, Scarlett,
my men are barefooted now!

740
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:55,311
And the snow in Virginia's deep.

741
00:56:55,604 --> 00:56:59,690
When I see them, and I see
the Yankees coming and coming...

742
00:56:59,941 --> 00:57:03,027
...always more and more!

743
00:57:04,863 --> 00:57:07,114
When the end does come,
I shall be far away.

744
00:57:08,617 --> 00:57:11,368
It'll be a comfort to me
to know that she has you.

745
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:15,122
You will promise, won't you?

746
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:18,209
Yes.

747
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,712
Is that all, Ashley?

748
00:57:21,963 --> 00:57:24,965
All except... goodbye.

749
00:57:25,217 --> 00:57:26,717
Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go!

750
00:57:26,968 --> 00:57:29,970
- You must be brave. You must!
- No, no!

751
00:57:30,222 --> 00:57:32,431
How else can I bear going?

752
00:57:33,099 --> 00:57:37,644
Oh, Scarlett! You're so fine
and strong and beautiful.

753
00:57:38,103 --> 00:57:40,813
Not just your sweet face, my dear...

754
00:57:41,065 --> 00:57:42,649
...but you.

755
00:57:46,904 --> 00:57:50,365
Ashley, kiss me. Kiss me goodbye.

756
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:54,577
Ashley.

757
00:57:56,914 --> 00:57:59,916
No, Scarlett. No!
- Oh, Ashley, I love you.

758
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:03,127
I've always loved you.
I've never loved anyone else.

759
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:05,797
I only married Charles just to hurt you.

760
00:58:06,006 --> 00:58:09,133
Ashley, tell me you love me.

761
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:12,262
I'll live on it the rest of my life!

762
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:15,181
Goodbye.

763
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:37,078
When the war's over, Ashley.

764
00:58:37,663 --> 00:58:39,789
When the war's over.

765
00:59:00,102 --> 00:59:02,437
- And there's a place back home...

766
00:59:02,688 --> 00:59:06,858
...where a wild plum tree
comes to flower in the springtime...

767
00:59:07,109 --> 00:59:09,027
...down by the creek, you know.

768
00:59:09,278 --> 00:59:11,529
Yes, I know, I know.

769
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,949
When we were little,
my brother Jeff and I used to...

770
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:18,911
I told you about my brother Jeff,
didn't I, ma'am?

771
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:22,040
I know I did. He...

772
00:59:22,249 --> 00:59:25,168
We don't know
where Jeff is now, ma'am.

773
00:59:25,419 --> 00:59:29,130
Since Bull Run,
we haven't heard anything and...

774
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,466
Please, we must have
your temperature now.

775
00:59:31,717 --> 00:59:36,054
Just take this in your mouth
and not talk anymore. Not just now.

776
00:59:36,305 --> 00:59:39,974
Melanie, I'm so tired.
I've got to go home.

777
00:59:40,225 --> 00:59:42,268
Aren't you tired, Melanie?

778
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,438
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.

779
00:59:45,689 --> 00:59:49,150
This might be Ashley...

780
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:52,320
...and only strangers here
to comfort him.

781
00:59:52,529 --> 00:59:54,989
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.

782
00:59:55,824 --> 00:59:57,700
They could all be...

783
00:59:57,951 --> 00:59:59,786
...Ashley.

784
01:00:11,423 --> 01:00:15,259
I've been waiting one solid hour
to speak to you, Mrs. Wilkes.

785
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,304
Go on, you trash.
Don't you be pestering these ladies.

786
01:00:18,555 --> 01:00:22,100
- Don't talk to her.
- It's all right. Who are you?

787
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:23,601
My name's Belle Watling.

788
01:00:23,852 --> 01:00:27,146
But that don't matter.
You think I got no business here.

789
01:00:27,398 --> 01:00:29,691
Tell me what you want
to see me about.

790
01:00:29,942 --> 01:00:33,277
First time I come here, I says,
"Belle, you're a nurse. "

791
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:37,573
They didn't want my kind of nursing.
They was more than likely right.

792
01:00:37,825 --> 01:00:42,119
Then I tried giving them money.
My money wasn't good enough either!

793
01:00:42,328 --> 01:00:43,704
The old peahens!

794
01:00:43,955 --> 01:00:46,581
I know a gentleman who says
you're a human being.

795
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:50,293
If you are, which they ain't,
you'll take my money for the hospital.

796
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:53,422
What are you doing here?
Haven't you been told twice already?

797
01:00:53,673 --> 01:00:55,674
This time I'm conversing
with Mrs. Wilkes!

798
01:00:55,883 --> 01:00:59,886
You might as well take my money.
It's good money, even if it is mine.

799
01:01:00,138 --> 01:01:04,684
- I'm sure you're very generous.
- I'm a Confederate, like everybody else.

800
01:01:04,935 --> 01:01:06,436
Of course you are!

801
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,730
Some folks here wouldn't feel that way.

802
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:12,150
But maybe they ain't
as good Christians as you.

803
01:01:18,824 --> 01:01:21,659
Look, Mrs. Meade,
it's a great deal of money.

804
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:24,245
Ten, 20, 30, 50!

805
01:01:24,455 --> 01:01:26,998
And it's not our paper money,
it's gold!

806
01:01:27,249 --> 01:01:30,376
Let me see that handkerchief. R.B.!

807
01:01:32,963 --> 01:01:36,549
And she's driving away
in Rhett Butler's carriage!

808
01:01:37,259 --> 01:01:40,928
Oh, if I just wasn't a lady,
what wouldn't I tell that varmint!

809
01:02:14,922 --> 01:02:17,840
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

810
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:21,594
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

811
01:02:24,598 --> 01:02:26,641
He restoreth my soul.

812
01:02:26,892 --> 01:02:30,770
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake.

813
01:02:30,979 --> 01:02:34,357
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

814
01:02:34,608 --> 01:02:37,860
...I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

815
01:02:38,111 --> 01:02:40,947
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me. "

816
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:42,990
The Yankees!

817
01:02:43,242 --> 01:02:46,244
Yankees! Oh, Dr. Meade,
they're getting closer.

818
01:02:46,495 --> 01:02:50,790
They'll never get into Atlanta.
Never get through old Peg Leg Hood.

819
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,751
Give me something for the pain!

820
01:02:54,711 --> 01:02:56,128
Give me something for the pain!

821
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:59,340
Sorry, son, we haven't
got anything to give you.

822
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:03,511
These animals is driving me crazy!

823
01:03:04,763 --> 01:03:06,681
What luck! You got my jack.

824
01:03:06,932 --> 01:03:09,350
Give me an ace
and I'll start another war.

825
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,435
And I'll bid the moon.

826
01:03:14,147 --> 01:03:19,277
- That I never see you
and my Pa again.

827
01:03:20,279 --> 01:03:21,779
This leg's got to come off.

828
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:24,240
No, don't! Leave me alone!

829
01:03:24,491 --> 01:03:25,616
I'm sorry, soldier.

830
01:03:25,826 --> 01:03:29,161
- We're all out of chloroform.
- We'll operate without it.

831
01:03:29,454 --> 01:03:32,123
No, no, you won't!
You can't do it.

832
01:03:32,374 --> 01:03:33,541
I won't let you do it!

833
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:36,794
Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off.
It's gangrene.

834
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:38,880
No! Oh!

835
01:03:39,172 --> 01:03:41,716
I haven't seen my family in three days.

836
01:03:41,967 --> 01:03:44,010
I'm going home for half an hour.

837
01:03:44,261 --> 01:03:45,928
Orderly, give me a lift!

838
01:03:50,016 --> 01:03:52,726
Nurse, you can free this bed.

839
01:03:53,144 --> 01:03:54,811
Miss Scarlett!

840
01:03:56,439 --> 01:03:57,939
Why, Frank Kennedy.

841
01:03:58,149 --> 01:04:00,275
Miss Suellen. Is she well?

842
01:04:00,526 --> 01:04:03,612
When did they bring you in?
Are you bad hurt?

843
01:04:03,863 --> 01:04:06,281
- Suellen. Is she...?
- She's all right.

844
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:08,450
Dr. Wilson needs you
in the operating room.

845
01:04:08,618 --> 01:04:10,869
He's gonna take off that leg.
Better hurry.

846
01:04:12,747 --> 01:04:14,205
I'll be back.

847
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:20,086
No! You leave me alone! Don't!

848
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:23,089
I can't stand it! No, don't!

849
01:04:23,257 --> 01:04:26,760
Don't cut! Don't cut!

850
01:04:27,011 --> 01:04:30,513
Don't! Don't! Please!

851
01:04:30,765 --> 01:04:32,349
Where's the nurse?

852
01:04:36,145 --> 01:04:37,604
Dr. Wilson's waiting.

853
01:04:37,855 --> 01:04:40,065
Let him wait! I'm going home!
I've done enough!

854
01:04:40,316 --> 01:04:44,027
I don't want any more men dying
and screaming. I don't want any more!

855
01:05:45,006 --> 01:05:46,215
Big Sam!

856
01:05:47,134 --> 01:05:49,719
Big Sam! Big Sam!

857
01:05:50,429 --> 01:05:52,722
Almighty Moses!
It's Miss Scarlett!

858
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:55,599
Big Sam! Big Sam.

859
01:05:55,767 --> 01:05:59,145
Sam, Elijah, Prophet, Apostle.
I'm so glad to see you.

860
01:05:59,312 --> 01:06:01,856
Tell me about Tara, about my mother.
She didn't write me.

861
01:06:02,065 --> 01:06:03,816
- She gone got sick.
- Sick?

862
01:06:04,067 --> 01:06:06,110
Just a little bit sick, that's all.

863
01:06:06,361 --> 01:06:09,238
Your pa went wild when
they wouldn't let him fight.

864
01:06:09,489 --> 01:06:13,117
He had fits when they took us
to dig the ditch for the soldiers.

865
01:06:13,368 --> 01:06:16,912
Your ma said the Confederacy needs it.
We's digging for the South.

866
01:06:17,164 --> 01:06:19,331
- Was there a doctor?
We've got to march.

867
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:21,876
Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.

868
01:06:22,127 --> 01:06:23,711
Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys.

869
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,796
If you get sick or hurt,
let me know.

870
01:06:26,006 --> 01:06:29,425
- Goodbye, Miss Scarlett. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.

871
01:06:49,529 --> 01:06:51,988
Scarlett! Scarlett!

872
01:06:56,452 --> 01:06:59,704
Climb into this buggy. This is no day
for walking. You'll get run over!

873
01:06:59,872 --> 01:07:01,331
Oh, Rhett.

874
01:07:01,499 --> 01:07:03,416
Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.

875
01:07:05,294 --> 01:07:06,961
Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?

876
01:07:10,508 --> 01:07:14,260
Just another of Sherman's calling
cards. He'll pay us a visit soon.

877
01:07:14,512 --> 01:07:17,222
I gotta get out of here
before the Yankees come!

878
01:07:17,473 --> 01:07:19,015
Leave your work at the hospital?

879
01:07:19,266 --> 01:07:23,019
Or have you had enough of death
and lice and men chopped up?

880
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:25,438
I suppose you weren't meant
for sick men.

881
01:07:25,689 --> 01:07:29,818
Don't talk like that. I'm so scared!
I wish I could get out of here.

882
01:07:30,027 --> 01:07:31,277
Let's get out together.

883
01:07:31,529 --> 01:07:34,447
No use letting the South
come down around your ears.

884
01:07:34,698 --> 01:07:37,325
There are too many nice places
to go and visit.

885
01:07:37,576 --> 01:07:40,411
- Mexico, London, Paris...
- With you?

886
01:07:40,663 --> 01:07:41,871
Yes, ma'am.

887
01:07:42,081 --> 01:07:45,375
With a man who understands
and admires you for what you are.

888
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:48,628
I figure we belong together,
being the same sort.

889
01:07:48,879 --> 01:07:53,424
I've been waiting for you to grow up
and get Ashley out of your heart.

890
01:07:53,634 --> 01:07:57,971
Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to
have a baby in another month or so.

891
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:02,392
It'll be hard loving a man with
a wife and baby clinging to him.

892
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,606
Well, here we are. Are you going
with me or are you getting out?

893
01:08:08,858 --> 01:08:10,608
I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler.

894
01:08:10,776 --> 01:08:13,069
I'll hate and despise you till I die!

895
01:08:14,697 --> 01:08:17,782
Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett.
Not that long.

896
01:08:24,874 --> 01:08:26,249
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!

897
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,128
Folks is all going to Macon,
and folks is running away!

898
01:08:30,379 --> 01:08:33,631
I can't bear those cannonballs
right in my ears!

899
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:36,134
I faint every time I hear one.

900
01:08:36,969 --> 01:08:39,262
Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk.

901
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:41,806
- You aren't leaving?
- I may be a coward...

902
01:08:42,057 --> 01:08:47,103
...but oh, dear! Yankees in Georgia!
How did they ever get in?

903
01:08:47,354 --> 01:08:49,939
I'm going too.
Prissy, go pack my things.

904
01:08:50,191 --> 01:08:51,608
Wait, I won't be a minute.

905
01:08:51,775 --> 01:08:54,277
- Do you really think you ought to?
Scarlett!

906
01:08:54,987 --> 01:08:57,864
What is this?
You ain't planning on running away?

907
01:08:58,115 --> 01:09:01,284
Don't try to stop me.
I'm never going back to that hospital.

908
01:09:01,535 --> 01:09:04,329
I've had enough of smelling death,
of rot and death.

909
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,916
I'm going home! I want my mother.
My mother needs me.

910
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:10,335
Listen to me! You must stay here.

911
01:09:10,586 --> 01:09:13,296
Without a chaperon?
It simply isn't...

912
01:09:13,547 --> 01:09:16,216
Good heavens, this is war,
not a garden party!

913
01:09:16,467 --> 01:09:19,093
- Melanie needs you.
- Oh, bother Melanie!

914
01:09:19,303 --> 01:09:22,472
She's ill already. She shouldn't
even be having a baby.

915
01:09:22,723 --> 01:09:24,349
Can't we take her along?

916
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:29,229
Want her to be jounced over rough roads
and have the baby ahead of time?

917
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,065
It isn't my baby.
You take care of her!

918
01:09:32,316 --> 01:09:35,568
We haven't enough doctors
to look after a sick woman.

919
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:37,070
You've got to stay.

920
01:09:37,321 --> 01:09:40,073
What for? I don't know anything
about babies being born.

921
01:09:40,324 --> 01:09:43,117
I knows! I knows!
I knows how to do it.

922
01:09:43,369 --> 01:09:46,287
I's done it lots and lots.
Let me, doctor. Let me.

923
01:09:46,497 --> 01:09:50,833
- I can do everything.
- Good. I'll rely on you to help us.

924
01:09:51,043 --> 01:09:54,170
Ashley's fighting in the field.
Fighting for the Cause.

925
01:09:54,421 --> 01:09:57,297
He may never come back.
He may die.

926
01:09:57,548 --> 01:10:00,550
Scarlett, we owe him
a well-born child.

927
01:10:00,718 --> 01:10:01,760
Ashley.

928
01:10:01,928 --> 01:10:04,388
If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!

929
01:10:04,639 --> 01:10:07,474
I promised Ashley something...

930
01:10:07,684 --> 01:10:09,351
Then you'll stay?

931
01:10:09,602 --> 01:10:12,688
Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.
Scarlett's staying.

932
01:10:12,939 --> 01:10:15,649
Go on, Uncle Peter.
I don't know what to do.

933
01:10:16,192 --> 01:10:19,194
It's like the end of the world!

934
01:10:19,445 --> 01:10:22,656
Uncle Peter, my smelling salt!

935
01:10:29,665 --> 01:10:32,125
Melanie, Melanie!
It's all your fault!

936
01:10:32,376 --> 01:10:34,294
I hate you! I hate you!

937
01:10:34,503 --> 01:10:36,045
And I hate your baby!

938
01:10:36,338 --> 01:10:41,050
If only I hadn't promised Ashley.
If only I hadn't promised him!

939
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,041
Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, stop.

940
01:11:13,292 --> 01:11:14,417
Are the Yankees coming?

941
01:11:14,626 --> 01:11:16,169
The army's pulling out.

942
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,504
Pulling out and leaving us
to the Yankees?

943
01:11:18,756 --> 01:11:23,176
Not leaving, evacuating. Before
Sherman cuts the McDonough road.

944
01:11:23,427 --> 01:11:25,053
It can't be true!

945
01:11:25,262 --> 01:11:26,387
What'll I do?

946
01:11:26,638 --> 01:11:30,266
Better refugee south, right quick.
If you'll excuse me.

947
01:11:31,226 --> 01:11:32,477
Prissy!

948
01:11:33,604 --> 01:11:38,232
Prissy! Go pack my things and
Melanie's too. We're going to Tara.

949
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,693
The Yankees are coming!

950
01:11:42,529 --> 01:11:45,406
Scarlett! Scarlett!

951
01:11:45,866 --> 01:11:47,575
Melly, we're going to...

952
01:11:49,828 --> 01:11:51,829
Melly...

953
01:11:53,624 --> 01:11:57,794
I'm sorry to be
such a bother, Scarlett.

954
01:11:59,505 --> 01:12:02,006
It began at daybreak.

955
01:12:02,174 --> 01:12:04,175
But... But...

956
01:12:04,551 --> 01:12:06,803
But the Yankees are coming.

957
01:12:07,846 --> 01:12:09,597
Poor Scarlett.

958
01:12:09,848 --> 01:12:13,810
You'd be at Tara now
with your mother, wouldn't you?

959
01:12:14,019 --> 01:12:15,561
If it weren't for me.

960
01:12:16,355 --> 01:12:20,316
Oh, Scarlett, darling.
You've been so good to me.

961
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:23,861
No sister could have been sweeter.

962
01:12:26,031 --> 01:12:28,658
I've been lying here thinking...

963
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:31,369
...if I should die...

964
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:34,705
...will you take my baby?

965
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:38,292
Fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.

966
01:12:38,544 --> 01:12:41,421
Aren't things bad enough
without you talking about dying?

967
01:12:41,672 --> 01:12:44,590
- I'll send for Dr. Meade.
- Not yet, Scarlett.

968
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,635
I couldn't let Dr. Meade
sit here for hours...

969
01:12:48,345 --> 01:12:51,806
...while all those poor,
wounded boys...

970
01:12:52,099 --> 01:12:54,225
Prissy! Prissy, Prissy!

971
01:12:54,476 --> 01:12:56,018
Come here, quick!

972
01:12:56,228 --> 01:12:58,688
Go get Dr. Meade. Run! Quick!

973
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:00,272
The baby.

974
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:03,525
Don't stand there like
a scared goat. Run!

975
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:08,113
Hurry, hurry!
I'll sell you south, I will.

976
01:13:08,364 --> 01:13:09,823
I swear I will!

977
01:13:11,075 --> 01:13:13,076
Where's that Prissy?

978
01:13:15,746 --> 01:13:20,167
This room's like an oven already
and it isn't noon yet.

979
01:13:22,753 --> 01:13:24,963
Don't worry, Melly.

980
01:13:25,173 --> 01:13:29,134
Mother says it always seems
like the doctor will never come.

981
01:13:29,969 --> 01:13:32,888
If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!

982
01:13:40,146 --> 01:13:41,313
Oh, Melly...

983
01:13:41,898 --> 01:13:44,399
Know what I heard
about Maybelle Merriwether?

984
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:46,693
You remember that
funny-looking beau of hers?

985
01:13:46,944 --> 01:13:50,030
The one with the uniform
like ladies' red flannels?

986
01:13:50,281 --> 01:13:53,783
You don't have to keep on
talking for my sake.

987
01:13:54,035 --> 01:13:56,870
I know how worried you are.

988
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:04,753
For to tote the weary load

989
01:14:04,962 --> 01:14:07,631
No matter, 'twill never...

990
01:14:09,258 --> 01:14:10,550
Oh, Melly...

991
01:14:10,801 --> 01:14:13,553
I'll just go and fetch you
some cooler water.

992
01:14:14,597 --> 01:14:17,432
You're slow as molasses in January.
Where's Dr. Meade?

993
01:14:17,683 --> 01:14:19,976
- I never seen him, Miss Scarlett.
- What?

994
01:14:20,186 --> 01:14:22,354
He ain't at the hospital.

995
01:14:22,605 --> 01:14:25,732
A man told me that the doctor's
down at the car shed...

996
01:14:25,942 --> 01:14:27,567
...with the wounded soldiers...

997
01:14:27,818 --> 01:14:30,070
Well, why didn't you go after him?

998
01:14:30,321 --> 01:14:34,866
Miss Scarlett, I's scared
to go down there at the car shed.

999
01:14:35,117 --> 01:14:40,247
There's folks dying down there.
And I's scared of dead folks!

1000
01:14:40,915 --> 01:14:42,332
Go sit by Miss Melly.

1001
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:46,294
And don't you be upsetting her
or I'll whip the hide off you.

1002
01:14:49,674 --> 01:14:51,925
Just a few more days

1003
01:14:52,134 --> 01:14:55,512
For to tote the weary load

1004
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:27,378
Have you seen...?
Move aside, lady, please.

1005
01:15:31,008 --> 01:15:32,800
Dr. Meade?

1006
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,092
Dr. Meade.

1007
01:16:16,886 --> 01:16:18,094
Dr. Meade, at last!

1008
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:21,765
Thank heaven you're here.
I need every pair of hands.

1009
01:16:22,308 --> 01:16:25,352
Now, come, child, wake up.
We got work to do.

1010
01:16:25,603 --> 01:16:28,605
But Melly's having her baby.
You've got to come with me!

1011
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:31,900
Are you crazy? I can't
leave these men for a baby.

1012
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:34,736
They're dying! Hundreds!
Get a woman to help.

1013
01:16:34,987 --> 01:16:38,073
But there isn't anybody.
Dr. Meade, she might die.

1014
01:16:38,324 --> 01:16:42,160
Die? Look at them, bleeding
to death in front of my eyes!

1015
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:44,663
No chloroform. No bandages.
Nothing!

1016
01:16:44,914 --> 01:16:46,498
Nothing to ease their pain.

1017
01:16:46,749 --> 01:16:48,750
Run along and don't bother me.

1018
01:16:49,418 --> 01:16:52,504
Don't worry, child.
There's nothing to bringing a baby.

1019
01:16:52,838 --> 01:16:55,173
- Bring the stretchers in here.
Dr. Meade?

1020
01:16:55,383 --> 01:16:57,258
Yeah, I'm coming.

1021
01:17:16,195 --> 01:17:18,113
Is the doctor come?

1022
01:17:18,364 --> 01:17:19,698
No, he can't come.

1023
01:17:19,949 --> 01:17:22,534
Oh, Miss Scarlett,
Miss Melly bad off.

1024
01:17:22,785 --> 01:17:25,412
He can't come.
There's nobody to come.

1025
01:17:26,122 --> 01:17:29,499
You've got to manage
without the doctor. I'll help you.

1026
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:32,001
Oh, Lordy, Miss Scarlett!

1027
01:17:32,795 --> 01:17:33,878
Well, what is it?

1028
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:36,256
Lordy, we's got to have a doctor!

1029
01:17:36,465 --> 01:17:39,592
I don't know nothing
about birthing babies!

1030
01:17:40,594 --> 01:17:42,345
- What do you mean?
- I don't know...

1031
01:17:42,555 --> 01:17:44,180
You told me
you knew everything!

1032
01:17:44,432 --> 01:17:46,182
I don't know why I lied!

1033
01:17:46,434 --> 01:17:48,935
Ma ain't never let me around
when folks was having them.

1034
01:17:50,521 --> 01:17:53,565
Scarlett! Scarlett!

1035
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:56,151
Miss Scarlett!

1036
01:17:56,569 --> 01:17:58,570
Stop it!

1037
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:02,115
Go light a fire on the stove.
Boil water in the kettle.

1038
01:18:02,324 --> 01:18:06,035
Get me a ball of twine,
clean towels and the scissors.

1039
01:18:06,245 --> 01:18:10,457
Don't tell me you can't find them!
Go get them and get them quick!

1040
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:15,462
Scarlett! Scarlett!

1041
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:23,803
- Scarlett!
- Coming, Melly.

1042
01:18:24,722 --> 01:18:26,306
Coming!

1043
01:18:29,393 --> 01:18:31,770
You better go
before the Yankees get here.

1044
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:33,772
You know I won't leave you.

1045
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:35,523
It's no use. I'm gonna die.

1046
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,817
Don't be a goose, Melly.
Hold on to me.

1047
01:18:38,068 --> 01:18:41,112
- Hold on to me!
- Talk to me, Scarlett.

1048
01:18:41,322 --> 01:18:43,656
Please, talk to me.

1049
01:18:43,908 --> 01:18:47,076
Don't try to be brave. Yell!
There's nobody to hear.

1050
01:18:47,328 --> 01:18:52,415
Ma says if you puts a knife
under the bed, it cuts the pain.

1051
01:18:57,254 --> 01:18:59,255
Captain Butler!

1052
01:18:59,757 --> 01:19:02,884
Captain Butler! Captain Butler!

1053
01:19:03,052 --> 01:19:04,886
- Who do you want?
- Captain Butler.

1054
01:19:05,095 --> 01:19:07,722
He's upstairs.
Belle Watling's giving a party.

1055
01:19:07,973 --> 01:19:11,099
Yes, sir. Thank you.

1056
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,063
Captain Butler! Oh, Captain Butler!

1057
01:19:16,231 --> 01:19:18,232
What's all the rumpus about?

1058
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:21,610
I's got a message
for Captain Butler, Mrs. Watling.

1059
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:25,322
Captain Butler, you come out here
in the streets to me!

1060
01:19:26,866 --> 01:19:30,452
- What is it, Prissy?
- Miss Scarlett done sent me for you.

1061
01:19:30,703 --> 01:19:34,081
Miss Melly, she done
had her baby today.

1062
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:36,792
A fine baby boy.

1063
01:19:37,043 --> 01:19:39,670
And Miss Scarlett and me,
we brung it.

1064
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:41,380
Are you telling me Scarlett...?

1065
01:19:41,631 --> 01:19:43,799
It was mostly me, Captain Butler.

1066
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:46,635
Only Miss Scarlett,
she helped me a little.

1067
01:19:46,886 --> 01:19:50,138
But I don't expect no doctor
could have done no better.

1068
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:55,144
Only, Miss Melly, she feel
kind of poorly now it's all over.

1069
01:19:55,729 --> 01:19:57,021
Yes, I can believe that.

1070
01:19:57,189 --> 01:19:59,732
And the Yankees is coming.
And Miss Scarlett, she says...

1071
01:20:02,361 --> 01:20:04,821
Captain Butler, the Yankees is here!

1072
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:08,700
Please come and bring
your carriage for us right away!

1073
01:20:08,951 --> 01:20:11,452
I'm sorry, but the army
took my horse and carriage.

1074
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:13,830
You better come upstairs.
I'll see what I can do.

1075
01:20:14,039 --> 01:20:15,290
Oh, no, Captain Butler.

1076
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:21,087
Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk
if I was to go into Mrs. Watling's.

1077
01:20:21,589 --> 01:20:25,592
Any of you beauties know where
I can steal a horse for a good cause?

1078
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:37,270
Is that you, Rhett?
We's here, Miss Scarlett!

1079
01:20:37,438 --> 01:20:38,646
I knew you'd come.

1080
01:20:38,898 --> 01:20:41,691
Nice weather we're having.
Prissy tells me you're...

1081
01:20:41,942 --> 01:20:44,652
If you make any jokes now,
I'll kill you!

1082
01:20:44,904 --> 01:20:47,238
- Don't tell me you're frightened?
- I'm scared to death!

1083
01:20:47,448 --> 01:20:49,115
If you had sense,
you'd be scared too.

1084
01:20:50,492 --> 01:20:52,327
- Oh, the Yankees!
- No, not yet.

1085
01:20:52,536 --> 01:20:55,663
That's what's left of our army
blowing up the ammunition.

1086
01:20:55,915 --> 01:20:57,957
We gotta get out of here!

1087
01:20:58,208 --> 01:21:00,251
At your service.
Where are you going?

1088
01:21:00,502 --> 01:21:04,172
- Home, to Tara.
- They've been fighting around Tara.

1089
01:21:04,381 --> 01:21:09,010
You're going to parade through there
with a sick woman, a baby and a darkie?

1090
01:21:09,219 --> 01:21:10,553
Do you intend leaving them?

1091
01:21:10,804 --> 01:21:13,139
They're going with me,
and you can't stop me!

1092
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:16,935
It's dangerous jouncing
Mrs. Wilkes over open country.

1093
01:21:17,186 --> 01:21:19,187
I want my mother!

1094
01:21:19,772 --> 01:21:21,689
I want to go home to Tara!

1095
01:21:21,982 --> 01:21:25,276
Tara's probably been burned.
The woods are full of stragglers.

1096
01:21:25,527 --> 01:21:27,445
The least they'll do
is take the horse.

1097
01:21:27,696 --> 01:21:30,281
It's not much,
but I had trouble stealing it.

1098
01:21:30,532 --> 01:21:33,785
I'm going home if I have to walk
every step of the way!

1099
01:21:34,036 --> 01:21:37,330
I'll kill you if you try
to stop me! I will, I will!

1100
01:21:37,498 --> 01:21:40,041
I will, I will!

1101
01:21:42,002 --> 01:21:44,087
Shh, shh, shh.

1102
01:21:44,672 --> 01:21:48,383
All right, darling, all right.
Now you shall go home.

1103
01:21:49,927 --> 01:21:54,013
I guess anybody who did what you've
done today can take care of Sherman.

1104
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:57,976
Stop crying.

1105
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:03,815
Now blow your nose
like a good little girl. There.

1106
01:22:15,368 --> 01:22:17,744
What're you doing?
- I'm packing!

1107
01:22:17,954 --> 01:22:20,914
Well, stop it
and come and get the baby!

1108
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:24,334
Melly?

1109
01:22:24,877 --> 01:22:26,420
- Melly?
Mrs. Wilkes?

1110
01:22:27,171 --> 01:22:29,423
- We're taking you to Tara.
- Tara?

1111
01:22:29,632 --> 01:22:31,216
It's the only way, Melly.

1112
01:22:31,426 --> 01:22:34,344
They'll burn the house
over our heads if we stay.

1113
01:22:34,554 --> 01:22:35,846
It's all right, Melly.

1114
01:22:36,097 --> 01:22:38,056
My baby.

1115
01:22:38,307 --> 01:22:40,434
My poor baby.

1116
01:22:44,564 --> 01:22:48,650
- Can you put your arms around my neck?
- I think so.

1117
01:22:51,529 --> 01:22:53,030
Never mind.

1118
01:22:53,448 --> 01:22:55,157
Ashley, Charles!

1119
01:22:55,366 --> 01:22:56,616
What's she want?

1120
01:22:56,868 --> 01:22:59,411
Ashley's picture and Charles' sword.

1121
01:22:59,662 --> 01:23:01,163
Get them.

1122
01:23:17,263 --> 01:23:18,305
What's that?

1123
01:23:18,556 --> 01:23:21,433
Our gallant lads set fire
to the warehouses.

1124
01:23:21,684 --> 01:23:24,227
Enough ammunition in boxcars
to blow us to Tara.

1125
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:27,064
- We have to get across the tracks.
- Not that way!

1126
01:23:27,315 --> 01:23:31,193
We have to. McDonough road's the
only one the Yankees haven't cut yet.

1127
01:23:40,661 --> 01:23:43,205
Wait, I forgot to lock the front door!

1128
01:23:43,456 --> 01:23:47,250
- What are you laughing at?
- At you, locking the Yankees out.

1129
01:24:03,601 --> 01:24:05,393
Oh, dear!
I wish they'd hurry.

1130
01:24:05,561 --> 01:24:08,105
I wouldn't be in such a hurry
to see them go.

1131
01:24:08,356 --> 01:24:11,650
With them goes the last
semblance of law and order.

1132
01:24:13,152 --> 01:24:15,195
Scavengers aren't wasting any time.

1133
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:21,576
Better get out of here fast.

1134
01:24:21,828 --> 01:24:23,954
There's a horse! Get it!

1135
01:24:25,623 --> 01:24:27,290
Give us that horse!

1136
01:24:34,215 --> 01:24:35,799
Down the alley! Cut him off!

1137
01:24:39,429 --> 01:24:40,680
Pull that horse!

1138
01:24:44,685 --> 01:24:46,269
I'll get him!

1139
01:24:49,481 --> 01:24:50,898
Give me that horse!

1140
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,077
Oh, Miss Scarlett!

1141
01:25:07,791 --> 01:25:09,458
Haven't left much to take.

1142
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:13,212
We'll make a dash for it before
the fire reaches that ammunition.

1143
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,483
Come on!

1144
01:25:40,072 --> 01:25:41,364
Throw me your shawl.

1145
01:25:44,327 --> 01:25:47,078
You'll like it better
if you don't see anything.

1146
01:25:48,915 --> 01:25:50,373
Come on!

1147
01:26:47,306 --> 01:26:50,558
Take a good look, my dear.
It's a historic moment.

1148
01:26:50,768 --> 01:26:55,146
Tell your grandchildren how you watched
the Old South disappear one night.

1149
01:27:11,998 --> 01:27:16,126
They were gonna lick the Yankees
in a month. The poor gallant fools.

1150
01:27:16,377 --> 01:27:17,502
They make me sick.

1151
01:27:17,753 --> 01:27:21,006
Getting us all into this
by swaggering and boasting.

1152
01:27:21,215 --> 01:27:24,968
That's the way I felt once about
their "swaggering and boasting. "

1153
01:27:25,469 --> 01:27:27,679
I'm so glad you aren't with the army.

1154
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:31,850
You can be proud. Proud that
you've been smarter than all of them.

1155
01:27:34,603 --> 01:27:36,646
I'm not so proud.

1156
01:27:55,207 --> 01:27:56,249
Why did you stop?

1157
01:27:56,459 --> 01:27:59,419
This is the turn to Tara.
Let the horse breathe a bit.

1158
01:27:59,587 --> 01:28:00,628
Mrs. Wilkes.

1159
01:28:00,838 --> 01:28:04,174
Miss Melly done fainted
way back, Captain Butler.

1160
01:28:04,383 --> 01:28:08,762
She's better off. She couldn't
stand the pain if she were conscious.

1161
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:12,390
Scarlett, are you still determined
to do this crazy thing?

1162
01:28:12,558 --> 01:28:15,226
Oh, yes, yes.
I know we can get through, Rhett.

1163
01:28:15,436 --> 01:28:18,480
Not we, my dear, you.
I'm leaving you here.

1164
01:28:19,273 --> 01:28:21,900
You're what?
Rhett, where are you going?

1165
01:28:22,151 --> 01:28:25,235
- I'm going to join the army.
- You're joking.

1166
01:28:25,487 --> 01:28:28,864
- I could kill you for scaring me so.
- I'm very serious, Scarlett.

1167
01:28:29,074 --> 01:28:31,617
I'm going to join up
with our brave lads in gray.

1168
01:28:31,868 --> 01:28:33,577
But they're running away.

1169
01:28:33,828 --> 01:28:37,790
They'll turn and make a last stand.
When they do, I'll be with them.

1170
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:41,710
- I'm a little late, but better late...
- You must be joking!

1171
01:28:42,504 --> 01:28:44,004
Selfish to the end, aren't you?

1172
01:28:44,255 --> 01:28:47,758
Thinking of your own hide,
never a thought for the Cause.

1173
01:28:47,967 --> 01:28:49,468
How could you do this to me?

1174
01:28:49,719 --> 01:28:52,763
And why should you go now that
it's all over, and I need you?

1175
01:28:52,931 --> 01:28:54,681
- Why? Why?
- Why?

1176
01:28:54,933 --> 01:28:59,103
I've always had a weakness
for lost causes, once they're really lost.

1177
01:28:59,354 --> 01:29:00,521
Or maybe...

1178
01:29:01,773 --> 01:29:04,233
Maybe I'm ashamed of myself.

1179
01:29:04,859 --> 01:29:05,943
Who knows?

1180
01:29:06,152 --> 01:29:09,071
You should die of shame
to leave me alone and helpless!

1181
01:29:09,322 --> 01:29:11,115
You? Helpless?

1182
01:29:11,825 --> 01:29:14,660
Heaven help the Yankees
if they capture you.

1183
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,954
Now climb down here.

1184
01:29:17,163 --> 01:29:19,039
- I want to say goodbye.
- No!

1185
01:29:20,167 --> 01:29:21,960
Climb down!

1186
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,423
Rhett, please don't go!

1187
01:29:26,632 --> 01:29:29,801
You can't leave me, please.
I'll never forgive you!

1188
01:29:30,052 --> 01:29:33,888
I'm not asking you to forgive me.
I'll never forgive myself.

1189
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:38,226
If a bullet gets me, I'll laugh
at myself for being an idiot.

1190
01:29:38,686 --> 01:29:42,397
There's one thing I do know,
and that is I love you, Scarlett.

1191
01:29:42,606 --> 01:29:46,776
In spite of you and me and the world
going to pieces, I love you.

1192
01:29:46,986 --> 01:29:49,612
Because we're alike.
Bad lots, both of us.

1193
01:29:49,864 --> 01:29:54,993
Selfish and shrewd, but able to look
things in the eye and call them by name.

1194
01:29:55,369 --> 01:29:57,328
Don't hold me like that!

1195
01:29:57,538 --> 01:29:58,663
Scarlett...

1196
01:29:58,873 --> 01:30:00,331
Look at me.

1197
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:02,959
I love you more than
I've ever loved any woman.

1198
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:06,087
And I've waited longer
for you than any woman.

1199
01:30:06,422 --> 01:30:08,256
Let me alone!

1200
01:30:08,841 --> 01:30:12,677
A soldier of the South loves you.
Wants your arms around him.

1201
01:30:12,928 --> 01:30:15,638
Wants to carry the memory
of your kisses into battle.

1202
01:30:15,848 --> 01:30:17,474
Never mind about loving me.

1203
01:30:17,725 --> 01:30:21,603
You're a woman sending a soldier
to his death with a beautiful memory.

1204
01:30:21,812 --> 01:30:24,355
Scarlett, kiss me.

1205
01:30:24,607 --> 01:30:27,025
Kiss me once.

1206
01:30:31,363 --> 01:30:33,907
You low-down, cowardly,
nasty thing, you!

1207
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:38,286
They were right. Everybody was right.
You aren't a gentleman.

1208
01:30:40,664 --> 01:30:43,500
A minor point at such a moment.

1209
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:48,379
Here. If anyone lays a hand
on that nag, shoot him.

1210
01:30:48,589 --> 01:30:50,590
But don't make a mistake
and shoot the nag.

1211
01:30:50,841 --> 01:30:53,051
Go on! I want you to go.

1212
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:56,221
I hope a cannonball blows you
into a million pieces...!

1213
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:59,682
Never mind the rest.
I follow your general idea.

1214
01:30:59,934 --> 01:31:04,646
And when I'm dead on the altar of my
country, I hope your conscience irks you.

1215
01:31:04,855 --> 01:31:07,273
Goodbye, Scarlett.

1216
01:31:32,382 --> 01:31:36,051
Come on, you. We're going home.

1217
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:53,629
Oh, my poor baby.

1218
01:32:54,631 --> 01:32:58,175
Don't worry. Mother will take care
of him when we get home.

1219
01:32:58,426 --> 01:33:01,303
Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.

1220
01:33:01,512 --> 01:33:04,848
- We's got to have something to eat.
- Hush up!

1221
01:33:05,058 --> 01:33:08,518
We're nearly at Twelve Oaks.
We'll stop there.

1222
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:10,312
Go on!

1223
01:34:14,628 --> 01:34:16,421
Oh, Ashley.

1224
01:34:17,131 --> 01:34:20,383
Ashley, I'm glad
you're not here to see this.

1225
01:34:21,093 --> 01:34:25,388
The Yankees. The dirty Yankees!

1226
01:34:39,736 --> 01:34:42,279
Prissy! Come tie up this cow.

1227
01:34:42,697 --> 01:34:44,948
We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.

1228
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:48,410
We'll be home soon,
and I's scared of cows.

1229
01:34:48,745 --> 01:34:51,913
Tie her onto the back of the wagon
with your petticoat.

1230
01:34:52,165 --> 01:34:56,793
We need milk for the baby, and we
don't know what we'll find at home.

1231
01:35:05,887 --> 01:35:07,179
Melly, we're home!

1232
01:35:07,346 --> 01:35:10,766
We're at Tara.
Hurry! Move, you brute!

1233
01:35:11,893 --> 01:35:14,352
Miss Scarlett, it's dead!

1234
01:35:14,604 --> 01:35:16,688
I can't see the house. Is it there?

1235
01:35:16,856 --> 01:35:18,774
I can't see the house.
Have they burned it?

1236
01:35:22,737 --> 01:35:26,823
It's all right! It's all right!
They haven't burned it.

1237
01:35:27,074 --> 01:35:28,700
It's still there!

1238
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:39,961
Mother! Mother, I'm home!

1239
01:35:44,801 --> 01:35:47,969
Mother, let me in. It's me. Scarlett!

1240
01:35:54,101 --> 01:35:55,894
Oh, Pa!

1241
01:35:56,312 --> 01:36:00,899
I'm home.

1242
01:36:03,444 --> 01:36:04,861
Katie?

1243
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:07,823
Katie Scarlett!

1244
01:36:08,032 --> 01:36:10,700
Oh, darlin'!

1245
01:36:20,962 --> 01:36:22,379
Mammy!

1246
01:36:23,256 --> 01:36:25,131
Mammy, I'm home.

1247
01:36:25,383 --> 01:36:27,384
Honey child...

1248
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,720
Mammy, I'm so...

1249
01:36:32,056 --> 01:36:33,181
Where's Mother?

1250
01:36:34,225 --> 01:36:35,725
Why...

1251
01:36:35,935 --> 01:36:39,771
...Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,
they was sick with the typhoid.

1252
01:36:40,189 --> 01:36:43,149
They had it bad,
but they's doing all right now.

1253
01:36:43,401 --> 01:36:46,695
- Just weak, like little kittens.
- But where's Mother?

1254
01:36:48,531 --> 01:36:49,698
Well...

1255
01:36:50,324 --> 01:36:54,119
Miss Ellen. She went down
to nurse that Emmie Slattery...

1256
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:58,248
...that white trash,
and she took down with it too.

1257
01:37:00,293 --> 01:37:01,793
Then last night, she...

1258
01:37:02,003 --> 01:37:19,352
Mother?

1259
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:16,700
Miss Scarlett, honey.

1260
01:38:16,952 --> 01:38:19,995
If there's anything I can do,
Miss Scarlett...

1261
01:38:20,664 --> 01:38:24,541
- What did you do with Melly?
- Don't worry your pretty head.

1262
01:38:24,751 --> 01:38:27,544
I done slapped her in bed,
along with the baby.

1263
01:38:27,796 --> 01:38:30,214
You better put that cow into the barn.

1264
01:38:30,465 --> 01:38:32,383
There ain't no barn no more.

1265
01:38:32,634 --> 01:38:36,679
- Yankees burned it for firewood.
This was their headquarters.

1266
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:38,430
They camped all around.

1267
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,057
Yankees in Tara?

1268
01:38:40,308 --> 01:38:42,977
Yes'm, and they stole
most everything they didn't burn.

1269
01:38:43,228 --> 01:38:47,983
All the clothes and all the rugs,
and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.

1270
01:38:49,485 --> 01:38:51,361
I'm starving.
Get me something to eat.

1271
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:54,614
There ain't nothing
to eat, honey. They took it all.

1272
01:38:55,116 --> 01:38:56,574
All the chickens? Everything?

1273
01:38:56,826 --> 01:38:58,410
They took them first.

1274
01:38:58,661 --> 01:39:01,371
What they didn't eat,
they carried off.

1275
01:39:01,622 --> 01:39:04,416
Don't tell me any more about
what "they" did!

1276
01:39:20,224 --> 01:39:21,725
What's this, Pa?

1277
01:39:22,226 --> 01:39:25,687
- Whiskey?
- Yes, daughter.

1278
01:39:29,316 --> 01:39:31,151
Katie Scarlett, that's enough.

1279
01:39:31,402 --> 01:39:34,487
Your not knowing spirits,
you'll make yourself tipsy.

1280
01:39:34,697 --> 01:39:36,781
I hope it makes me drunk.

1281
01:39:36,991 --> 01:39:39,034
I'd like to be drunk.

1282
01:39:41,746 --> 01:39:43,079
Oh, Pa...

1283
01:39:46,208 --> 01:39:47,542
What are those papers?

1284
01:39:49,003 --> 01:39:50,712
Bonds.

1285
01:39:52,048 --> 01:39:55,717
They're all we've saved,
all we have left.

1286
01:39:55,926 --> 01:39:57,218
Bonds.

1287
01:39:57,470 --> 01:40:00,096
But what kind of bonds, Pa?

1288
01:40:00,347 --> 01:40:02,640
Why, Confederate bonds, of course.

1289
01:40:02,892 --> 01:40:04,809
Confederate bonds.

1290
01:40:05,061 --> 01:40:07,228
What good are they to anybody?

1291
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:10,148
I'll not have you talking like that.

1292
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:13,485
Oh, Pa, what are we going to do
with no money...

1293
01:40:13,736 --> 01:40:15,320
...and nothing to eat?

1294
01:40:15,946 --> 01:40:18,031
We must ask your mother.

1295
01:40:18,532 --> 01:40:23,244
That's it.
We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.

1296
01:40:24,163 --> 01:40:25,747
- Ask Mother?
- Yes.

1297
01:40:26,665 --> 01:40:29,709
Mrs. O'Hara will know
what's to be done.

1298
01:40:30,419 --> 01:40:34,380
Now don't be bothering me.
Go out for a ride.

1299
01:40:34,548 --> 01:40:35,632
I'm busy.

1300
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,818
Oh, Pa...

1301
01:40:56,361 --> 01:40:58,487
Don't worry about anything.

1302
01:40:59,155 --> 01:41:01,406
Katie Scarlett's home.

1303
01:41:03,368 --> 01:41:05,369
You needn't worry.

1304
01:41:20,385 --> 01:41:25,389
What'll we do with nothing
to feed those sick folks and that child?

1305
01:41:26,933 --> 01:41:28,725
I don't know, Mammy.

1306
01:41:29,227 --> 01:41:30,310
I don't know.

1307
01:41:30,478 --> 01:41:33,313
We ain't got nothing
but radishes in the garden.

1308
01:41:33,606 --> 01:41:36,483
Miss Scarlett,
Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen...

1309
01:41:36,734 --> 01:41:39,778
...they's fussing to be sponged off.

1310
01:41:39,988 --> 01:41:43,782
- Where are the other servants?
- Only just me and Pork left.

1311
01:41:44,033 --> 01:41:46,243
The others went to war
or runned away.

1312
01:41:46,452 --> 01:41:49,830
I can't take care of
that baby and sick folkses too!

1313
01:41:50,582 --> 01:41:52,499
I's only got two hands.

1314
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:57,880
Who's gonna milk that cow,
Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.

1315
01:43:19,963 --> 01:43:22,422
As God is my witness...

1316
01:43:22,674 --> 01:43:26,176
As God is my witness,
they're not going to lick me.

1317
01:43:26,386 --> 01:43:29,389
I'm going to live through this,
and when it's all over...

1318
01:43:29,598 --> 01:43:34,143
...I'll never be hungry again.
No, nor any of my folk.

1319
01:43:34,895 --> 01:43:38,231
If I have to lie, steal,
cheat, or kill...

1320
01:43:38,482 --> 01:43:43,611
...as God is my witness,
I'll never be hungry again!

1321
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:58,544
My back's near broken.

1322
01:51:00,213 --> 01:51:02,464
Look at my hands!

1323
01:51:02,632 --> 01:51:06,009
Mother said you could always
tell a lady by her hands.

1324
01:51:06,261 --> 01:51:10,639
I guess things like hands and ladies
don't matter so much anymore.

1325
01:51:11,099 --> 01:51:14,810
Rest, Sue. You're not well yet.
I can pick cotton for both of us.

1326
01:51:15,103 --> 01:51:18,605
Scarlett's hateful!
Making us work in the fields...

1327
01:51:18,815 --> 01:51:20,816
Too bad about that.

1328
01:51:21,151 --> 01:51:24,069
Get back to work. I can't do
everything at Tara myself.

1329
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,655
What do I care about Tara?
I hate Tara!

1330
01:51:29,993 --> 01:51:32,745
Don't you ever dare say
you hate Tara again!

1331
01:51:33,621 --> 01:51:36,081
It's the same as hating Pa and Ma.

1332
01:51:43,423 --> 01:51:45,841
There's something
I must speak to you about.

1333
01:51:46,009 --> 01:51:47,050
What is it?

1334
01:51:47,302 --> 01:51:50,679
I don't like the way
you're treating Prissy and Mammy.

1335
01:51:50,972 --> 01:51:55,684
You must be firm with inferiors,
but gentle with them. Especially darkies.

1336
01:51:55,977 --> 01:51:59,688
I know. But I'm not asking them to do
what I don't do myself.

1337
01:51:59,939 --> 01:52:04,860
Nevertheless, I don't like it.
I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.

1338
01:52:19,542 --> 01:52:22,795
- What are you doing out of bed?
- I must talk to you.

1339
01:52:23,046 --> 01:52:25,881
You're all working so hard.
I can't just lie in bed.

1340
01:52:26,174 --> 01:52:28,634
Go upstairs.
You're as weak as a newborn colt.

1341
01:52:28,843 --> 01:52:31,136
- Please, let me.
- Stop being noble.

1342
01:52:31,387 --> 01:52:35,224
I don't need you making yourself
sick so you'll never be any use.

1343
01:52:35,475 --> 01:52:38,393
Oh, I didn't think of it that way.

1344
01:53:33,658 --> 01:53:36,618
Who's there?
Halt or I'll shoot!

1345
01:53:42,709 --> 01:53:44,751
You all alone, little lady?

1346
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:49,756
You ain't very friendly, are you?

1347
01:53:52,552 --> 01:53:55,095
You got anything else
besides these earbobs?

1348
01:53:55,388 --> 01:53:57,389
You Yankees have been here before.

1349
01:53:58,182 --> 01:54:00,601
Regular little spitfire, ain't you?

1350
01:54:01,936 --> 01:54:04,563
What do you got hidden in your hand?

1351
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:42,309
Scarlett, you killed him.

1352
01:54:43,019 --> 01:54:44,937
I'm glad you killed him.

1353
01:54:46,147 --> 01:54:49,816
Scarlett, what happened?
What is it, Scarlett? What is it?

1354
01:54:53,863 --> 01:54:54,947
Don't be scared!

1355
01:54:55,198 --> 01:54:59,660
Your sister was cleaning a revolver
and it went off and scared her.

1356
01:54:59,869 --> 01:55:02,788
Thank goodness!
We got enough to frighten us.

1357
01:55:03,039 --> 01:55:06,291
Tell Katie Scarlett
she must be more careful.

1358
01:55:08,878 --> 01:55:10,879
What a cool liar you are, Melly.

1359
01:55:11,756 --> 01:55:13,882
We gotta get him out of here
and bury him.

1360
01:55:14,175 --> 01:55:15,759
If the Yankees find him here...

1361
01:55:15,969 --> 01:55:19,054
I didn't see anyone else.
I think he must be a deserter.

1362
01:55:19,305 --> 01:55:20,889
Even so, we've gotta hide him.

1363
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:25,268
They might hear about it,
and then they'd come and get you.

1364
01:55:27,772 --> 01:55:31,149
I could bury him in the arbor
where the ground is soft...

1365
01:55:31,401 --> 01:55:33,402
...but how will I get him
out of here?

1366
01:55:33,695 --> 01:55:37,572
- We'll both take a leg and drag him.
- You couldn't drag a cat.

1367
01:55:41,577 --> 01:55:42,744
Scarlett...

1368
01:55:43,913 --> 01:55:46,999
Would it be dishonest
if we went through his haversack?

1369
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:49,584
I'm ashamed I didn't think
of that myself.

1370
01:55:49,836 --> 01:55:52,587
You take the haversack.
I'll search his pockets.

1371
01:56:04,850 --> 01:56:08,185
You look. I'm feeling a little weak.

1372
01:56:09,563 --> 01:56:11,564
I think it's full of money.

1373
01:56:11,815 --> 01:56:15,943
Melly, look. Just look!
Ten, 20, 30...

1374
01:56:16,194 --> 01:56:18,446
Don't stop to count it now.
We haven't got time!

1375
01:56:18,739 --> 01:56:20,781
Do you realize this means we can eat?

1376
01:56:21,033 --> 01:56:23,242
Look in his other pockets.

1377
01:56:24,911 --> 01:56:26,412
Hurry, hurry!

1378
01:56:26,621 --> 01:56:28,622
We've got to get him out of here.

1379
01:56:42,345 --> 01:56:44,972
If he bleeds across the yard,
we can't hide it.

1380
01:56:45,223 --> 01:56:48,100
Give me your nightgown.
I'll wad it round his head.

1381
01:56:48,351 --> 01:56:53,481
Don't be silly, I won't look at you.
If I had on pantalets, I'd use them.

1382
01:57:06,912 --> 01:57:09,497
Thank heavens I'm not that modest.

1383
01:57:10,165 --> 01:57:12,500
Now go back to bed.
You'll be dead if you don't.

1384
01:57:12,751 --> 01:57:14,960
I'll clean up my mess
when I've buried him.

1385
01:57:15,462 --> 01:57:17,755
No, I'll clean it up.

1386
01:57:21,009 --> 01:57:23,302
Well, I guess I've done murder.

1387
01:57:25,013 --> 01:57:29,517
I won't think about that now.
I'll think about that tomorrow.

1388
01:57:41,197 --> 01:57:42,781
Katie Scarlett!

1389
01:57:42,990 --> 01:57:44,783
It's over! It's over!

1390
01:57:45,868 --> 01:57:49,162
It's all over, the war.
Lee surrendered!

1391
01:57:49,413 --> 01:57:51,832
- It's not possible.
- Why did we ever fight?

1392
01:57:52,041 --> 01:57:53,667
Ashley will be coming home.

1393
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:56,294
Yes, Ashley will be coming home.

1394
01:57:56,504 --> 01:58:00,841
We'll plant more cotton.
Cotton ought to go sky-high next year.

1395
01:58:23,781 --> 01:58:25,949
The flag that makes you free

1396
01:58:26,117 --> 01:58:29,202
So we sing the chorus
From Atlanta to the sea

1397
01:58:29,453 --> 01:58:33,039
While we were marching through Georgia

1398
01:58:33,249 --> 01:58:35,250
Get out of the road, rebel!

1399
01:58:35,459 --> 01:58:37,711
Have you room for a dying man?

1400
01:58:37,962 --> 01:58:41,381
Not for any Southern scum,
alive or dead. Get out of the way!

1401
01:58:41,924 --> 01:58:44,718
I reckon he'd rather try
and walk it, at that.

1402
01:58:44,969 --> 01:58:47,053
Jump, you gray-backed beggars!

1403
01:58:47,263 --> 01:58:49,431
Acts like they won the war.

1404
01:58:49,891 --> 01:58:52,392
You come on, give me
them pants, Mr. Kennedy.

1405
01:58:52,602 --> 01:58:53,852
Come on!

1406
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:59,441
Scrub yourself with that lye soap,
'fore I scrub you myself.

1407
01:58:59,692 --> 01:59:02,777
I'm gonna put these britches
in the boiling pot.

1408
01:59:05,573 --> 01:59:07,699
The whole army's
got the same troubles...

1409
01:59:07,950 --> 01:59:10,576
...crawling clothes and dysentery.

1410
01:59:10,785 --> 01:59:12,703
It's humiliating how
you're treating him.

1411
01:59:12,996 --> 01:59:16,749
You'd be a sight more humiliated
if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you.

1412
01:59:18,418 --> 01:59:20,085
Oh, come on, Beau!

1413
01:59:20,295 --> 01:59:24,506
We must leave this gentleman alone
because he's tired and he's hungry.

1414
01:59:24,758 --> 01:59:27,593
I don't mind, ma'am.
Good to see a youngster again.

1415
01:59:27,802 --> 01:59:29,053
Nice little fella.

1416
01:59:29,262 --> 01:59:32,556
Another two years, and we could've
had him in Cobb's Legion.

1417
01:59:33,725 --> 01:59:36,560
- Were you in Cobb's Legion?
Yes, ma'am.

1418
01:59:36,811 --> 01:59:40,272
Why, then, you must know
my husband, Major Wilkes?

1419
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:44,068
Oh, yes, ma'am. He was captured
at Spotsylvania, I think.

1420
01:59:44,319 --> 01:59:48,280
Captured? Oh, thank heaven!
Then he isn't...

1421
01:59:48,531 --> 01:59:51,742
- My poor Ashley, in a Yankee prison.
Melanie?

1422
01:59:52,661 --> 01:59:55,496
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.
Come along, Beau.

1423
01:59:55,664 --> 01:59:58,082
I'll watch out for him.
We're good friends.

1424
01:59:58,333 --> 01:59:59,917
Thank you.

1425
02:00:03,964 --> 02:00:07,174
I slave day and night
just so we can have enough food...

1426
02:00:07,425 --> 02:00:09,677
...and you give it away
to scarecrows.

1427
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:13,681
- I'd sooner have a plague of locusts.
- Don't scold me, Scarlett.

1428
02:00:13,848 --> 02:00:16,558
I've just heard that Ashley
was taken prisoner.

1429
02:00:16,768 --> 02:00:18,269
- Ashley a prisoner?
- Yes.

1430
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:22,856
And maybe if he's alive and well,
he's on some Northern road right now.

1431
02:00:23,108 --> 02:00:26,193
Maybe a Northern woman
is giving him some of her dinner...

1432
02:00:26,361 --> 02:00:29,947
...and helping my beloved
to come back home to me.

1433
02:00:31,366 --> 02:00:34,159
- I hope so, Melly.
Miss Scarlett?

1434
02:00:37,497 --> 02:00:41,875
I want to take up something
with your Pa, but he doesn't seem to...

1435
02:00:42,127 --> 02:00:44,670
Perhaps I can help you.
I'm head of the house now.

1436
02:00:44,838 --> 02:00:46,880
Well, I... I...

1437
02:00:47,090 --> 02:00:49,967
Miss Scarlett, I was aiming
to ask for Suellen.

1438
02:00:50,885 --> 02:00:55,139
Are you telling me you haven't asked
for her after all these years?

1439
02:00:56,224 --> 02:00:59,018
The truth is, I'm so much
older than she is...

1440
02:00:59,227 --> 02:01:01,228
...and now I haven't
a cent to my name.

1441
02:01:01,521 --> 02:01:03,105
Who has, nowadays?

1442
02:01:03,356 --> 02:01:06,066
Miss Scarlett, if true love
carries any weight with you...

1443
02:01:06,318 --> 02:01:09,069
...you can be sure your sister
will be rich in that.

1444
02:01:09,321 --> 02:01:12,489
I'd go and get myself a little business,
if we're engaged.

1445
02:01:12,741 --> 02:01:15,034
- As soon as I'm on my feet again...
- All right, Frank.

1446
02:01:15,243 --> 02:01:18,746
I'm sure I can speak for Pa.
You go ask her now.

1447
02:01:19,205 --> 02:01:22,249
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Scarlett.

1448
02:01:24,669 --> 02:01:27,504
Excuse me, Mrs. Wilkes.
Excuse me.

1449
02:01:29,382 --> 02:01:32,259
What seems to be
the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?

1450
02:01:32,510 --> 02:01:36,263
More trouble than he guesses.
He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.

1451
02:01:36,431 --> 02:01:37,931
Oh, I'm so glad.

1452
02:01:38,266 --> 02:01:42,603
It's a pity he can't marry her now.
It'd be one less mouth to feed.

1453
02:01:46,274 --> 02:01:48,192
Oh, another one!

1454
02:01:48,443 --> 02:01:50,736
- Hope this one isn't hungry.
- He'll be hungry.

1455
02:01:50,945 --> 02:01:53,447
I'll tell Prissy to get
an extra plate...

1456
02:02:05,210 --> 02:02:10,130
Ashley!

1457
02:02:22,936 --> 02:02:23,977
Miss Scarlett!

1458
02:02:24,270 --> 02:02:25,396
Don't spoil it.

1459
02:02:25,647 --> 02:02:28,482
Turn me loose, you fool.
Turn me loose! It's Ashley!

1460
02:02:28,733 --> 02:02:30,776
He's her husband, ain't he?

1461
02:02:43,164 --> 02:02:44,998
- Miss Scarlett?
- High time you got back.

1462
02:02:45,250 --> 02:02:48,252
- Did you get the horse shod?
- Yes'm, he's shod.

1463
02:02:48,461 --> 02:02:50,838
Fine thing, horses
get shoes and humans can't.

1464
02:02:51,089 --> 02:02:52,714
Here, stir this soap.

1465
02:02:52,966 --> 02:02:54,133
Miss Scarlett, ma'am?

1466
02:02:54,342 --> 02:02:57,594
I gotta know how much money
have you got left. In gold.

1467
02:02:57,804 --> 02:02:59,805
Ten dollars. Why?

1468
02:03:00,598 --> 02:03:01,807
That won't be enough.

1469
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:03,767
What are you talking about?

1470
02:03:04,018 --> 02:03:08,230
Well, I see'd that old no-count
white-trash Wilkerson...

1471
02:03:08,481 --> 02:03:11,024
...that used to be
Mr. Gerald's overseer here.

1472
02:03:11,276 --> 02:03:14,778
He's a regular Yankee now,
and he was making a brag...

1473
02:03:14,988 --> 02:03:19,992
...that his Carpetbagger friends run
the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.

1474
02:03:20,243 --> 02:03:24,788
- How much more we got to pay?
- I hear the taxman say $300.

1475
02:03:24,998 --> 02:03:26,457
Three hundred...!

1476
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:31,879
It might just as well be 3 million.
But we gotta raise it, that's all.

1477
02:03:32,130 --> 02:03:34,798
Yes'm. How?

1478
02:03:36,759 --> 02:03:40,220
- I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
- He ain't got no $300.

1479
02:03:40,388 --> 02:03:43,140
Well, I can ask him
if I want to, can't I?

1480
02:03:45,310 --> 02:03:47,227
Asking ain't getting.

1481
02:03:56,237 --> 02:03:57,779
Ashley...

1482
02:03:58,781 --> 02:04:01,909
They say Abe Lincoln
got his start splitting rails.

1483
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:05,078
Just think what heights I may
climb to, once I get the knack.

1484
02:04:05,288 --> 02:04:09,583
Ashley, the Yankees
want $300 more in taxes.

1485
02:04:10,418 --> 02:04:12,336
What shall we do?

1486
02:04:12,587 --> 02:04:15,047
Ashley, what's to become of us?

1487
02:04:15,256 --> 02:04:18,800
What becomes of people
when their civilization breaks up?

1488
02:04:19,010 --> 02:04:21,720
Those with brains and courage
come through all right.

1489
02:04:21,930 --> 02:04:23,597
Those that haven't are winnowed out.

1490
02:04:23,848 --> 02:04:25,098
For heaven's sake...

1491
02:04:25,350 --> 02:04:28,810
...don't talk nonsense
when it's us being winnowed out!

1492
02:04:29,062 --> 02:04:33,607
You're right, Scarlett. Here I am
talking tommyrot about civilization...

1493
02:04:33,858 --> 02:04:35,943
...while your Tara is in danger.

1494
02:04:36,194 --> 02:04:39,029
You've come to me for help,
and I've none to give.

1495
02:04:39,864 --> 02:04:43,200
Oh, Scarlett, I'm a coward.

1496
02:04:43,576 --> 02:04:45,702
You, Ashley? A coward?

1497
02:04:46,287 --> 02:04:47,829
What are you afraid of?

1498
02:04:48,706 --> 02:04:52,584
Mostly of life becoming
too real for me, I suppose.

1499
02:04:52,794 --> 02:04:55,337
Not that I mind splitting rails.

1500
02:04:55,713 --> 02:05:00,467
But I do mind very much losing
the beauty of that life I loved.

1501
02:05:02,053 --> 02:05:07,140
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent
my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.

1502
02:05:07,433 --> 02:05:08,642
But the war did come.

1503
02:05:09,269 --> 02:05:11,812
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.

1504
02:05:12,063 --> 02:05:15,148
I saw men crumple up in agony
when I shot them.

1505
02:05:15,984 --> 02:05:20,570
And now I find myself in a world
which for me is worse than death.

1506
02:05:20,821 --> 02:05:22,989
A world in which there's
no place for me.

1507
02:05:25,158 --> 02:05:28,869
I can't make you understand.
You don't know the meaning of fear.

1508
02:05:29,079 --> 02:05:31,789
You never mind facing realities.

1509
02:05:32,499 --> 02:05:35,001
You never want to escape
from them as I do.

1510
02:05:37,671 --> 02:05:39,297
Escape?

1511
02:05:40,382 --> 02:05:44,510
Ashley, you're wrong.
I do want to escape too.

1512
02:05:44,803 --> 02:05:49,515
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money.

1513
02:05:49,683 --> 02:05:53,269
I've weeded, hoed and picked cotton
till I can't stand it.

1514
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:55,813
I tell you, the South is dead.
It's dead!

1515
02:05:56,023 --> 02:05:59,942
The Yankees and Carpetbaggers
have it and left nothing for us.

1516
02:06:02,195 --> 02:06:03,654
Oh, Ashley...

1517
02:06:04,323 --> 02:06:07,158
Let's run away.
We'd go to Mexico.

1518
02:06:07,409 --> 02:06:10,369
They want officers in the Mexican army.
We'd be happy.

1519
02:06:10,537 --> 02:06:12,663
I'd work for you.
I'd do anything for you!

1520
02:06:12,873 --> 02:06:16,334
You don't love Melanie. You said
you loved me at Twelve Oaks.

1521
02:06:16,543 --> 02:06:18,711
And anyway, Melanie can't...

1522
02:06:19,338 --> 02:06:22,715
Dr. Meade said she can't have
more children. I could give you...

1523
02:06:22,966 --> 02:06:24,550
Can't we ever forget Twelve Oaks?

1524
02:06:24,843 --> 02:06:27,053
You think I could ever forget?
Have you?

1525
02:06:27,346 --> 02:06:30,389
Can you honestly say
you don't love me?

1526
02:06:31,058 --> 02:06:33,476
- No, I don't love you.
- It's a lie!

1527
02:06:33,685 --> 02:06:36,646
Even so, do you think
I'd leave Melanie and the baby?

1528
02:06:36,855 --> 02:06:39,565
You couldn't leave
your father and the girls.

1529
02:06:39,858 --> 02:06:42,151
I'm sick of them.
I'm tired of them!

1530
02:06:42,361 --> 02:06:46,030
Yes, you're sick and tired.
That's why you're talking this way.

1531
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:49,325
You've carried the load
for all of us.

1532
02:06:49,534 --> 02:06:52,578
From now on, I'll be more help
to you. I promise.

1533
02:06:52,746 --> 02:06:54,747
There's only one way you can help me.

1534
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:59,168
Take me away.
There's nothing to keep us here.

1535
02:07:00,045 --> 02:07:01,462
Nothing?

1536
02:07:02,965 --> 02:07:05,217
Nothing except honor.

1537
02:07:17,772 --> 02:07:21,525
Please, Scarlett.
Please, dear. You mustn't cry.

1538
02:07:21,776 --> 02:07:26,488
You mustn't. Please,
my brave dear, you mustn't.

1539
02:07:38,584 --> 02:07:41,294
You do love me! You do love me!

1540
02:07:41,504 --> 02:07:43,797
- No, don't, don't.
- You love me.

1541
02:07:44,090 --> 02:07:46,258
We won't do this.
I tell you, we won't do it!

1542
02:07:46,467 --> 02:07:49,261
It won't happen again.
I'll take Melanie and go.

1543
02:07:49,512 --> 02:07:52,139
- Say it. You love me.
- All right, I'll say it.

1544
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:56,476
I love your courage and stubbornness
so much that I could forget...

1545
02:07:56,644 --> 02:08:01,314
...the best wife a man ever had.
But I'm not going to forget her!

1546
02:08:10,491 --> 02:08:12,993
Then there's nothing left for me.

1547
02:08:13,995 --> 02:08:16,121
Nothing to fight for.

1548
02:08:16,831 --> 02:08:19,040
Nothing to live for.

1549
02:08:21,419 --> 02:08:23,627
Yes, there is something.

1550
02:08:24,296 --> 02:08:26,922
Something you love better than me...

1551
02:08:27,132 --> 02:08:29,049
...though you may not know it.

1552
02:08:35,056 --> 02:08:36,557
Tara.

1553
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:41,270
Yes.

1554
02:08:43,190 --> 02:08:45,316
I still have this.

1555
02:08:49,946 --> 02:08:51,572
You needn't go.

1556
02:08:52,157 --> 02:08:56,368
I won't have you all starve, simply
because I threw myself at your head.

1557
02:08:57,037 --> 02:08:59,288
It won't happen again.

1558
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,067
It's Emmie Slattery.

1559
02:09:28,235 --> 02:09:29,527
- Yes'm, it's me.
Stop!

1560
02:09:30,737 --> 02:09:33,697
You haven't forgotten
your old overseer, have you?

1561
02:09:34,407 --> 02:09:36,408
Emmie's Mrs. Wilkerson now.

1562
02:09:36,660 --> 02:09:39,245
Get off those steps, you wench!
Get off this land!

1563
02:09:39,704 --> 02:09:41,413
You can't speak that way to my wife.

1564
02:09:41,665 --> 02:09:43,707
Wife? High time
you made her your wife.

1565
02:09:43,917 --> 02:09:46,335
Who baptized your brats
after you killed my mother?

1566
02:09:46,837 --> 02:09:48,546
We came out here to pay a call.

1567
02:09:48,755 --> 02:09:51,757
A friendly call, and talk business
with old friends.

1568
02:09:52,008 --> 02:09:54,426
Friends? When were we ever friends?

1569
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:57,763
Still high and mighty, ain't you?
Well, I know all about you.

1570
02:09:58,014 --> 02:09:59,390
Your father's turned idiot.

1571
02:09:59,641 --> 02:10:03,519
You can't pay your taxes, and I come
to offer to buy the place from you.

1572
02:10:03,728 --> 02:10:07,147
To make you a right good offer.
Emmie wants to live here.

1573
02:10:07,399 --> 02:10:09,358
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee!

1574
02:10:09,609 --> 02:10:14,196
You'll see who's running
things when you're sold out for taxes.

1575
02:10:14,447 --> 02:10:16,740
I'll buy this place
and I'll live in it!

1576
02:10:17,158 --> 02:10:19,577
But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.

1577
02:10:19,786 --> 02:10:22,288
That's all of Tara you'll ever get!

1578
02:10:23,415 --> 02:10:25,416
You'll be sorry for that.

1579
02:10:33,967 --> 02:10:35,301
We'll be back!

1580
02:10:35,552 --> 02:10:38,137
I'll show you who
the owner of Tara is!

1581
02:10:43,435 --> 02:10:44,977
Pa, come back!

1582
02:10:47,981 --> 02:10:49,815
Pa, come back!

1583
02:10:51,943 --> 02:10:53,444
Yankee coward!

1584
02:11:01,328 --> 02:11:02,411
Pa!

1585
02:11:22,766 --> 02:11:25,935
Lordy, Miss Scarlett,
that's Mr. Gerald's watch!

1586
02:11:26,186 --> 02:11:29,145
You take it. It's for you.
Pa'd want you to have it.

1587
02:11:29,355 --> 02:11:32,607
You ain't got no business
parting from this watch now.

1588
02:11:32,858 --> 02:11:36,152
You needs all your valuables
to sell for that tax money.

1589
02:11:36,362 --> 02:11:39,030
Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?

1590
02:11:40,032 --> 02:11:42,033
And don't cry.

1591
02:11:42,242 --> 02:11:44,870
I can stand everybody's
tears but yours.

1592
02:11:48,792 --> 02:11:51,126
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!

1593
02:11:56,383 --> 02:12:00,761
You've been brave so long.
You just gotta go on being brave.

1594
02:12:00,971 --> 02:12:04,890
- Think about your Pa like he used to be.
- I can't think about Pa.

1595
02:12:05,141 --> 02:12:07,309
I can't think of anything
but that $300.

1596
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:11,981
Ain't no good thinking about that.
Ain't nobody got that much money.

1597
02:12:12,273 --> 02:12:16,360
Nobody but Yankees and Scalawags
got that much money now.

1598
02:12:17,862 --> 02:12:18,904
Rhett.

1599
02:12:19,155 --> 02:12:21,782
Who that? A Yankee?

1600
02:12:26,037 --> 02:12:29,665
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale...

1601
02:12:29,874 --> 02:12:32,209
...and I haven't any clothes.

1602
02:12:41,678 --> 02:12:44,304
Go and get Ma's old box
of dress patterns.

1603
02:12:44,556 --> 02:12:47,266
- What you up to?
- You'll make me a new dress.

1604
02:12:47,517 --> 02:12:49,935
Not with Miss Ellen's portires!

1605
02:12:50,186 --> 02:12:52,896
Great balls of fire!
They're my portires now.

1606
02:12:53,106 --> 02:12:56,817
I'm going to Atlanta for $300,
and I've got to look like a queen.

1607
02:12:57,027 --> 02:12:58,819
- Who's going with you?
- I'll go alone.

1608
02:12:59,029 --> 02:13:03,115
That's what you think!
I's going with you and that new dress.

1609
02:13:03,366 --> 02:13:06,118
- Mammy, darling.
- No use to try to sweet talk me.

1610
02:13:06,369 --> 02:13:08,829
I knows you since I put
diapers on you.

1611
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:12,124
I said I's going with you,
and going I is!

1612
02:13:12,333 --> 02:13:15,544
Kings in trade, eh?
Too good for me, major.

1613
02:13:16,254 --> 02:13:18,547
It's a pity the war
wasn't a poker game.

1614
02:13:18,798 --> 02:13:21,633
You'd done better than Grant,
with far less effort.

1615
02:13:21,801 --> 02:13:22,843
What is it?

1616
02:13:23,094 --> 02:13:26,638
There's a lady to see Captain Butler.
Says she's his sister.

1617
02:13:26,931 --> 02:13:28,474
Another sister?

1618
02:13:28,725 --> 02:13:30,976
This is a jail not a harem, captain.

1619
02:13:31,269 --> 02:13:34,646
No, she ain't one of those.
She's got her mammy with her.

1620
02:13:35,648 --> 02:13:37,483
She has?

1621
02:13:38,109 --> 02:13:41,653
I'd like to see this one, major.
Without her mammy.

1622
02:13:42,864 --> 02:13:46,658
Let's see, my losses for
the afternoon come to what?

1623
02:13:48,078 --> 02:13:49,578
Three hundred and forty?

1624
02:13:49,788 --> 02:13:52,581
My debts do mount up,
don't they, major?

1625
02:13:52,791 --> 02:13:57,586
All right, corporal, show Captain
Butler's "sister" to his cell.

1626
02:13:57,796 --> 02:14:00,839
Thank you, major.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1627
02:14:05,095 --> 02:14:09,765
It's hard to be strict with a man
who loses money so pleasantly.

1628
02:14:10,683 --> 02:14:13,185
- Rhett!
- Scarlett!

1629
02:14:13,436 --> 02:14:16,480
My dear little sister!

1630
02:14:16,856 --> 02:14:21,485
It's all right, corporal. My sister
has brought me no files or saws.

1631
02:14:26,658 --> 02:14:27,699
Can I really kiss you?

1632
02:14:27,992 --> 02:14:29,868
On the forehead, like a good brother.

1633
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:33,371
No, thanks. I'll wait and hope
for better things.

1634
02:14:33,622 --> 02:14:36,541
I was so distressed when
I heard you were in jail.

1635
02:14:36,792 --> 02:14:40,711
I couldn't sleep for thinking.
It's not true they'll hang you?

1636
02:14:40,963 --> 02:14:42,547
Would you be sorry?

1637
02:14:42,798 --> 02:14:44,465
- Oh, Rhett.
- Well, don't worry yet.

1638
02:14:44,716 --> 02:14:47,802
They trumped up a charge,
but they really want my money.

1639
02:14:48,053 --> 02:14:50,721
They think I made off
with the Confederate treasury.

1640
02:14:50,973 --> 02:14:53,516
- Well, did you?
- What a leading question.

1641
02:14:53,725 --> 02:14:55,935
Let's not talk about things
like money.

1642
02:14:56,186 --> 02:14:59,564
How good of you to come and see me.
And how pretty you look!

1643
02:14:59,857 --> 02:15:02,567
How you do run on,
teasing a country girl like me.

1644
02:15:02,860 --> 02:15:07,363
Thank heavens you're not in rags.
I'm tired of women in rags. Turn around.

1645
02:15:08,198 --> 02:15:10,408
You look good enough to eat,
and prosperous.

1646
02:15:10,659 --> 02:15:14,078
I've been doing very well.
Everyone's well at Tara, only...

1647
02:15:14,329 --> 02:15:17,832
...I got so bored, I thought
I'd treat myself to a visit to town.

1648
02:15:18,083 --> 02:15:20,585
You're heartless,
but that's part of your charm.

1649
02:15:20,752 --> 02:15:22,920
You've got more charm
than the law allows.

1650
02:15:23,172 --> 02:15:25,506
I didn't come to talk
silliness about me.

1651
02:15:25,757 --> 02:15:28,593
I was so miserable at the thought
of you in trouble.

1652
02:15:28,844 --> 02:15:31,762
I was mad at you when
you left me on the road to Tara.

1653
02:15:31,972 --> 02:15:34,932
- And I still haven't forgiven you.
- Don't say that.

1654
02:15:35,184 --> 02:15:39,103
Well, I must admit I might not be
alive now, only for you.

1655
02:15:39,354 --> 02:15:43,107
When I think of myself
with anything I could possibly hope for...

1656
02:15:43,358 --> 02:15:47,195
...not a care in the world,
and you here in this horrid jail.

1657
02:15:47,404 --> 02:15:51,115
And not even a human jail,
Rhett, a horse jail!

1658
02:15:51,783 --> 02:15:54,202
Listen to me trying to make jokes...

1659
02:15:54,411 --> 02:15:56,120
...when I really want to cry.

1660
02:15:56,622 --> 02:15:58,372
In a minute I shall cry.

1661
02:16:01,793 --> 02:16:03,085
Scarlett...

1662
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:04,962
Can it be possible that...?

1663
02:16:05,214 --> 02:16:07,006
Can what be possible, Rhett?

1664
02:16:07,257 --> 02:16:10,760
That you've grown a woman's heart?
A real woman's heart.

1665
02:16:11,011 --> 02:16:14,096
I have, Rhett. I know I have.

1666
02:16:15,933 --> 02:16:19,227
It's worth being in jail
just to hear you say that.

1667
02:16:21,063 --> 02:16:22,813
It's well worth it.

1668
02:16:27,277 --> 02:16:29,655
You can drop the moonlight
and magnolia.

1669
02:16:29,948 --> 02:16:33,825
Things have been going well at Tara?
What've you done with your hands?

1670
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:39,248
- I went riding without my gloves...
- You've been working like a field hand!

1671
02:16:39,457 --> 02:16:41,625
Why did you lie,
and what are you up to?

1672
02:16:41,834 --> 02:16:44,962
- I almost believed you cared.
- But I do care!

1673
02:16:45,171 --> 02:16:48,298
Let's get down to the truth.
You want something enough...

1674
02:16:48,508 --> 02:16:50,634
...to put on quite a
show in your velvets.

1675
02:16:50,843 --> 02:16:53,262
What is it? Money?

1676
02:16:53,471 --> 02:16:56,056
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.

1677
02:16:56,307 --> 02:16:58,767
I lied when I said
everything was all right.

1678
02:16:59,018 --> 02:17:03,522
Things are as bad as they possibly
could be. And you've got millions.

1679
02:17:04,524 --> 02:17:06,108
What collateral do you have?

1680
02:17:06,317 --> 02:17:07,818
- My earbobs.
- Not interested.

1681
02:17:08,027 --> 02:17:10,320
- Mortgage on Tara.
- What would I do with a farm?

1682
02:17:10,530 --> 02:17:14,950
- I'd pay you out of next year's cotton.
- Not good enough.

1683
02:17:17,578 --> 02:17:19,871
You once said you loved me.

1684
02:17:20,081 --> 02:17:21,540
If you still love me...

1685
02:17:22,333 --> 02:17:24,710
You haven't forgotten,
I'm not a marrying man.

1686
02:17:25,586 --> 02:17:28,338
No, I haven't forgotten.

1687
02:17:33,594 --> 02:17:35,721
You're not worth $300.

1688
02:17:36,014 --> 02:17:38,848
You'll never mean anything
but misery to any man.

1689
02:17:39,308 --> 02:17:42,143
I don't care what you say,
only give me the money.

1690
02:17:42,394 --> 02:17:46,063
I won't let Tara go! I can't while
there's a breath left in my body.

1691
02:17:46,231 --> 02:17:49,900
Oh, Rhett, won't you please
give me the money?

1692
02:17:50,193 --> 02:17:52,236
I couldn't if I wanted to.

1693
02:17:52,487 --> 02:17:54,405
My funds are in Liverpool,
not Atlanta.

1694
02:17:54,656 --> 02:17:58,409
If I drew a draft, they'd be on me
like a duck on a June bug.

1695
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:02,413
So you see, my dear,
you've abased yourself to no purpose.

1696
02:18:04,916 --> 02:18:09,337
Here, here. Stop it! You want
the Yankees to see you like this?

1697
02:18:09,588 --> 02:18:13,674
Take your hands off me, you skunk!
You knew what I wanted.

1698
02:18:13,925 --> 02:18:17,094
You knew you wouldn't lend me
the money and you let me go on!

1699
02:18:17,262 --> 02:18:20,014
I enjoyed hearing
what you had to say. Cheer up.

1700
02:18:20,223 --> 02:18:22,433
Come to my hanging,
I'll put you in my will.

1701
02:18:22,684 --> 02:18:24,435
I'll come to your hanging!

1702
02:18:24,686 --> 02:18:28,689
I'm just afraid they won't hang you
in time to pay the taxes on Tara!

1703
02:18:35,238 --> 02:18:36,781
Tell him Belle Watling.

1704
02:18:36,948 --> 02:18:39,950
Where you been? I thought
you deserted Captain Butler.

1705
02:18:40,243 --> 02:18:42,870
I keep myself occupied.
Help me out.

1706
02:18:51,588 --> 02:18:55,466
Who that? I ain't never see'd hair
that color before in my life.

1707
02:18:55,759 --> 02:18:57,259
You know a dyed-haired woman?

1708
02:18:57,469 --> 02:19:00,638
Wish I knew that one.
She'd get my money for me.

1709
02:19:02,724 --> 02:19:04,600
Whatever they done
to you in there...

1710
02:19:04,810 --> 02:19:08,771
...they didn't do no more than you
deserve for visiting white trash.

1711
02:19:15,654 --> 02:19:17,905
Fresh and green.
Right off the farm.

1712
02:19:18,115 --> 02:19:21,826
What you doing tonight, Susie?
That's a Georgia peach!

1713
02:19:22,119 --> 02:19:23,744
Nothing like that in Ohio.

1714
02:19:23,912 --> 02:19:25,329
You know what we'll do?

1715
02:19:25,497 --> 02:19:26,539
What?

1716
02:19:26,706 --> 02:19:29,583
We're gonna give every one of you
40 acres and a mule.

1717
02:19:29,835 --> 02:19:32,586
And a mule?
- Forty acres and a mule!

1718
02:19:32,754 --> 02:19:35,172
Gee!
- Because we're your friend.

1719
02:19:35,424 --> 02:19:39,718
And you're gonna become voters
and vote like your friends do!

1720
02:19:41,638 --> 02:19:44,098
What's your hurry?
What's come over this town?

1721
02:19:44,307 --> 02:19:48,018
Yankees have come over it.
Same as they've come over all of them.

1722
02:19:50,188 --> 02:19:52,022
Out of our way, trash!

1723
02:19:52,315 --> 02:19:54,942
Get out of the way here!
Get away! Go on.

1724
02:20:03,243 --> 02:20:04,743
It can't be Miss Scarlett!

1725
02:20:04,995 --> 02:20:06,662
Frank Kennedy!
And Mammy.

1726
02:20:06,872 --> 02:20:08,747
It's good to see home folks.

1727
02:20:08,999 --> 02:20:11,834
I didn't know you were here.
I didn't know you were.

1728
02:20:12,043 --> 02:20:14,336
Didn't Suellen tell you
about my store?

1729
02:20:14,546 --> 02:20:17,465
Did she? I don't remember.
Have you a store?

1730
02:20:17,883 --> 02:20:21,218
- This?
- Won't you come in, look around a bit?

1731
02:20:29,394 --> 02:20:31,896
I don't suppose
it looks like much to a lady...

1732
02:20:32,147 --> 02:20:34,398
...but I can't help being proud of it.

1733
02:20:34,649 --> 02:20:37,485
- You're not making money?
- Well, I can't complain.

1734
02:20:37,694 --> 02:20:39,403
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.

1735
02:20:39,654 --> 02:20:42,071
Folks tell me
I'm just a born merchant.

1736
02:20:42,364 --> 02:20:45,241
Won't be long before
Miss Suellen and I can marry.

1737
02:20:45,493 --> 02:20:48,786
- Are you doing as well as all that?
- Yes, I am.

1738
02:20:49,038 --> 02:20:50,663
I'm no millionaire yet...

1739
02:20:50,915 --> 02:20:53,333
...but I've cleared $1000 already.

1740
02:20:53,584 --> 02:20:55,043
And lumber too.

1741
02:20:56,587 --> 02:20:59,422
- That's only a sideline.
- A sideline, Frank?

1742
02:20:59,590 --> 02:21:03,510
With all the good Georgia pine
around Atlanta, and all this building?

1743
02:21:03,719 --> 02:21:06,429
Well, all that takes money,
Miss Scarlett...

1744
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:09,015
...and I gotta think
about buying a home.

1745
02:21:09,266 --> 02:21:10,601
Why would you want a home?

1746
02:21:10,852 --> 02:21:13,103
For Suellen to set up housekeeping.

1747
02:21:13,563 --> 02:21:15,022
Here in Atlanta.

1748
02:21:15,232 --> 02:21:17,525
You'd want to bring her to Atlanta.

1749
02:21:17,817 --> 02:21:20,444
There wouldn't be much help
in that for Tara.

1750
02:21:21,321 --> 02:21:23,239
I don't know what you mean.

1751
02:21:24,115 --> 02:21:25,866
I don't mean a thing.

1752
02:21:26,535 --> 02:21:29,370
How'd you like to drive me
to my Aunt Pitty's?

1753
02:21:29,704 --> 02:21:32,039
Nothing'd give me more pleasure.

1754
02:21:32,249 --> 02:21:33,832
You better stay to supper.

1755
02:21:34,084 --> 02:21:37,253
Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable,
and I'd like a long visit.

1756
02:21:37,462 --> 02:21:40,965
You act on me just like a tonic,
Miss Scarlett.

1757
02:21:41,299 --> 02:21:43,342
And will you tell me all the news...

1758
02:21:43,593 --> 02:21:44,969
...of Miss Suellen?

1759
02:21:48,139 --> 02:21:51,225
What's the matter?
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?

1760
02:21:51,726 --> 02:21:55,229
Oh, no, no. I thought
surely she had written you.

1761
02:21:55,438 --> 02:21:58,649
I guess she was ashamed to write you.
She should be ashamed.

1762
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:01,151
How awful to have such a mean sister.

1763
02:22:01,486 --> 02:22:03,237
You must tell me.

1764
02:22:03,488 --> 02:22:05,447
Don't leave me on tenterhooks.

1765
02:22:05,657 --> 02:22:08,993
Well, she's going to marry
one of the county boys next month.

1766
02:22:10,078 --> 02:22:13,747
She got tired of waiting,
was afraid she'd be an old maid and...

1767
02:22:13,957 --> 02:22:16,875
Oh, I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you.

1768
02:22:17,377 --> 02:22:20,004
It's cold, and I left my muff at home.

1769
02:22:20,297 --> 02:22:23,507
Would you mind if I put my hand
in your pocket?

1770
02:22:39,524 --> 02:22:42,359
But, Melanie, you don't realize
what she's done!

1771
02:22:42,611 --> 02:22:45,029
She's gone and married
my Mr. Kennedy!

1772
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:47,323
He's my beau and she's married him!

1773
02:22:47,532 --> 02:22:50,784
- She did it to save Tara.
- I hate Tara!

1774
02:22:51,036 --> 02:22:54,622
I hate Scarlett! She's
the only thing I hate worse than Tara!

1775
02:22:58,877 --> 02:23:00,669
It's all my fault.

1776
02:23:01,504 --> 02:23:04,673
I should've committed robbery
to get that tax money for you.

1777
02:23:04,924 --> 02:23:07,176
I couldn't let you do
anything like that.

1778
02:23:07,427 --> 02:23:08,844
Anyway, it's done now.

1779
02:23:09,054 --> 02:23:11,221
Yes, it's done now.

1780
02:23:11,431 --> 02:23:13,557
You won't let me do
anything dishonorable...

1781
02:23:13,808 --> 02:23:16,894
...yet you'd sell yourself in marriage
to a man you didn't love.

1782
02:23:17,062 --> 02:23:19,897
You won't have to worry
about my helplessness anymore.

1783
02:23:21,566 --> 02:23:22,983
What do you mean?

1784
02:23:23,234 --> 02:23:25,069
I'm going to New York.

1785
02:23:26,321 --> 02:23:28,030
I've arranged
for a position in a bank.

1786
02:23:28,239 --> 02:23:30,240
But you can't do that.

1787
02:23:32,452 --> 02:23:35,871
I counted on you to help me start
a lumber business and...

1788
02:23:36,039 --> 02:23:37,081
I counted on you.

1789
02:23:37,332 --> 02:23:40,084
I don't know anything
about the lumber business.

1790
02:23:40,377 --> 02:23:42,753
You know as much as you do
about banking...

1791
02:23:43,046 --> 02:23:45,755
...and I'd give you half the business.

1792
02:23:46,006 --> 02:23:48,549
That's generous of you, Scarlett.

1793
02:23:48,926 --> 02:23:50,510
But it isn't that.

1794
02:23:50,719 --> 02:23:53,596
If I go to Atlanta
and take help from you again...

1795
02:23:53,847 --> 02:23:56,265
...I'd bury any hope
of ever standing alone.

1796
02:23:56,517 --> 02:23:57,850
Oh, is that all?

1797
02:23:58,060 --> 02:24:02,772
You could gradually buy the business,
and then it would be your own and...

1798
02:24:03,440 --> 02:24:04,899
No, Scarlett.

1799
02:24:07,528 --> 02:24:09,904
Oh! Ashley!

1800
02:24:17,371 --> 02:24:18,955
Ashley!

1801
02:24:26,422 --> 02:24:27,505
Scarlett?

1802
02:24:28,882 --> 02:24:30,133
Scarlett, what is it?

1803
02:24:30,384 --> 02:24:32,760
Ashley's so mean and hateful!

1804
02:24:33,011 --> 02:24:34,721
What have you done?

1805
02:24:35,431 --> 02:24:37,974
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.

1806
02:24:38,559 --> 02:24:42,228
To help me start my lumber business.
And he won't help me!

1807
02:24:42,813 --> 02:24:44,605
How unchivalrous of you.

1808
02:24:44,815 --> 02:24:46,816
Why, think, Ashley, think!

1809
02:24:47,067 --> 02:24:50,153
If it hadn't been for Scarlett,
I'd have died in Atlanta...

1810
02:24:50,320 --> 02:24:52,822
...and maybe we wouldn't have
little Beau.

1811
02:24:53,031 --> 02:24:55,491
When I think of her picking cotton
and plowing...

1812
02:24:55,743 --> 02:24:58,286
...just to keep food in our mouths,
I could just...

1813
02:24:58,495 --> 02:25:00,580
Oh, my darling.

1814
02:25:04,626 --> 02:25:07,336
All right, Melanie.
I'll go to Atlanta.

1815
02:25:09,548 --> 02:25:11,466
I can't fight you both.

1816
02:25:26,315 --> 02:25:28,316
Come on, lift them feet!

1817
02:25:30,778 --> 02:25:33,571
There's your new mill hands,
Mrs. Kennedy.

1818
02:25:33,822 --> 02:25:36,866
The pick of all the best jails
in Georgia.

1819
02:25:37,326 --> 02:25:40,369
They look thin and weak.
Halt!

1820
02:25:42,998 --> 02:25:44,373
They're the best you can lease.

1821
02:25:44,625 --> 02:25:47,335
If you'll give Johnnie Gallegher
a free hand...

1822
02:25:47,586 --> 02:25:49,796
...you'll get what you want
out of them.

1823
02:25:50,005 --> 02:25:51,881
All right, you're the foreman.

1824
02:25:52,132 --> 02:25:55,469
Just keep the mill running
and deliver my lumber when I want it.

1825
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:58,555
Johnnie Gallegher's
your man, miss. But remember...

1826
02:25:58,807 --> 02:26:01,350
...no questions and no interference.

1827
02:26:01,726 --> 02:26:04,186
That's a bargain.
Start in the morning.

1828
02:26:04,395 --> 02:26:06,355
Come on, get a move on there!

1829
02:26:06,564 --> 02:26:11,318
But this isn't right, and you know it.
Bad enough to be a businesswoman...

1830
02:26:11,528 --> 02:26:12,736
Why do you complain?

1831
02:26:13,029 --> 02:26:15,239
You wouldn't own a mill
if I didn't take over.

1832
02:26:15,406 --> 02:26:17,115
But I didn't want the mill.

1833
02:26:17,325 --> 02:26:20,994
We couldn't buy it if you hadn't
pressed our friends for their debts.

1834
02:26:21,162 --> 02:26:22,329
Isn't that right, Ashley?

1835
02:26:22,539 --> 02:26:24,623
Are you running
a charitable institution?

1836
02:26:24,874 --> 02:26:28,252
Go back to the store, and go home
and take your medicine.

1837
02:26:28,545 --> 02:26:30,087
Sugar, don't you think...?

1838
02:26:30,338 --> 02:26:34,007
Great balls of fire! Don't bother me.
And don't call me "sugar. "

1839
02:26:34,217 --> 02:26:37,678
All right. All right.
Good night, Ashley.

1840
02:26:38,263 --> 02:26:39,763
My, my!

1841
02:26:40,014 --> 02:26:43,183
She can get mad quicker
than any woman I ever saw.

1842
02:26:44,519 --> 02:26:46,353
I don't like to interfere...

1843
02:26:46,563 --> 02:26:49,897
...but I wish you'd let me hire
darkies and not use convicts.

1844
02:26:50,148 --> 02:26:51,274
We could do better.

1845
02:26:51,567 --> 02:26:54,277
Darkies' pay would break us.
Convicts are cheap.

1846
02:26:54,570 --> 02:26:56,237
If we give Gallegher a free hand...

1847
02:26:56,446 --> 02:26:59,699
A free hand? That means
he'll starve and whip them.

1848
02:26:59,950 --> 02:27:01,951
Didn't you see them?
Some are sick.

1849
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:03,536
How you do run on.

1850
02:27:03,787 --> 02:27:06,372
If I let you alone,
you'd give them chicken...

1851
02:27:06,623 --> 02:27:08,666
...and tuck them in with quilts.

1852
02:27:08,917 --> 02:27:12,628
I won't make money out of the
enforced labor and misery of others.

1853
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:14,380
You didn't mind owning slaves.

1854
02:27:14,715 --> 02:27:17,216
That was different.
We didn't treat them that way.

1855
02:27:17,467 --> 02:27:19,468
I'd have freed them
when father died...

1856
02:27:19,761 --> 02:27:21,888
...if the war hadn't
already freed them.

1857
02:27:22,139 --> 02:27:23,639
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.

1858
02:27:23,807 --> 02:27:26,058
Do you forget what it's like
without money?

1859
02:27:26,310 --> 02:27:29,061
Money is the most
important thing in the world.

1860
02:27:29,271 --> 02:27:31,397
I don't intend to be without it again.

1861
02:27:31,648 --> 02:27:35,943
I'll make enough the only way I know
how so the Yankees can't take Tara.

1862
02:27:36,194 --> 02:27:38,571
We're not the only Southerners
who've suffered.

1863
02:27:38,822 --> 02:27:42,450
Look at all our friends. They're
keeping their honor and kindness.

1864
02:27:42,701 --> 02:27:46,203
And they're starving. I've no use
for fools who won't help themselves.

1865
02:27:46,455 --> 02:27:48,664
I know what they say about me.
I don't care.

1866
02:27:48,832 --> 02:27:51,626
I'll befriend Carpetbaggers
and beat them at their own game.

1867
02:27:51,835 --> 02:27:53,711
And you'll beat them with me.

1868
02:27:56,256 --> 02:27:59,425
That's it. Pull it
a little over to that side.

1869
02:27:59,676 --> 02:28:02,219
- Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
- Good afternoon.

1870
02:28:02,471 --> 02:28:05,097
- Business is certainly growing.
- It certainly is.

1871
02:28:06,808 --> 02:28:08,935
You're doing business
with the people...

1872
02:28:09,186 --> 02:28:12,146
...who robbed us, tortured us
and left us to starve.

1873
02:28:12,314 --> 02:28:13,356
All that's past.

1874
02:28:13,649 --> 02:28:17,234
I intend to make the best of things,
even if they are Yankee things.

1875
02:28:19,863 --> 02:28:23,032
And do you know that Dr. Meade
actually saw her...

1876
02:28:23,283 --> 02:28:26,619
...peddling lumber to Yankees herself?
- That isn't all.

1877
02:28:26,828 --> 02:28:29,538
It's shocking what she's doing
to my brother.

1878
02:28:29,748 --> 02:28:32,667
She's even taken to driving
her own buggy.

1879
02:28:40,175 --> 02:28:43,552
My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
My very dear Mrs. Kennedy!

1880
02:28:43,762 --> 02:28:46,055
I don't see how you have
the gall to face me!

1881
02:28:46,264 --> 02:28:49,976
You could've had my millions
if you'd just waited a while.

1882
02:28:50,227 --> 02:28:51,644
Oh, how fickle is woman!

1883
02:28:51,895 --> 02:28:54,146
What is it you want?
I have things to do.

1884
02:28:54,356 --> 02:28:58,317
Will you satisfy my curiosity on a point
which has always bothered me?

1885
02:28:58,527 --> 02:28:59,735
Well, what is it?

1886
02:29:00,278 --> 02:29:04,365
Tell me, do you never shrink
from marrying men you don't love?

1887
02:29:04,658 --> 02:29:07,910
How'd you get out ofjail?
Why didn't they hang you?

1888
02:29:08,412 --> 02:29:11,664
Oh, that! There's nothing much
that money won't buy.

1889
02:29:11,873 --> 02:29:15,209
I observe it's even bought you
the honorable Mr. Wilkes.

1890
02:29:15,502 --> 02:29:19,422
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
I believe you're jealous of him.

1891
02:29:19,673 --> 02:29:24,385
You still think you're the belle of the
county, the cutest trick in shoe leather.

1892
02:29:24,594 --> 02:29:27,722
- That every man is in love with you.
- Let me by.

1893
02:29:28,598 --> 02:29:31,684
Don't be angry.
Tell me, where are you going?

1894
02:29:31,893 --> 02:29:35,021
- I'm going out to the mill.
- Through Shantytown alone?

1895
02:29:35,272 --> 02:29:38,566
It's dangerous to drive alone
through all that riffraff.

1896
02:29:38,817 --> 02:29:40,234
Don't worry about me.

1897
02:29:40,444 --> 02:29:43,779
I can shoot straight,
if I don't have to shoot too far.

1898
02:29:50,912 --> 02:29:52,538
What a woman!

1899
02:30:27,156 --> 02:30:28,323
Give me a quarter.

1900
02:30:28,741 --> 02:30:30,116
Let go of my horse!

1901
02:30:32,453 --> 02:30:33,953
Hold this horse.

1902
02:30:40,003 --> 02:30:41,670
- Let go!
- Give me that gun.

1903
02:30:44,591 --> 02:30:46,884
Help! Help!

1904
02:30:49,262 --> 02:31:04,777
Help!

1905
02:31:24,548 --> 02:31:25,548
Miss Scarlett!

1906
02:31:43,483 --> 02:31:44,525
Wait!

1907
02:31:44,943 --> 02:31:46,735
Miss Scarlett, wait!

1908
02:31:46,945 --> 02:31:48,320
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!

1909
02:31:48,655 --> 02:31:50,239
It's Sam!
- Big Sam?

1910
02:31:50,907 --> 02:31:51,991
Miss Scarlett, wait!

1911
02:31:54,828 --> 02:31:56,537
Sam! Sam!

1912
02:31:56,746 --> 02:31:59,874
Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?
Did they hurt you?

1913
02:32:00,542 --> 02:32:04,461
Don't you cry. Big Sam will get
you out of this in a jiffy.

1914
02:32:05,255 --> 02:32:06,964
Horse, make tracks!

1915
02:32:10,385 --> 02:32:12,595
Get to Tara as quick
as you can and stay there.

1916
02:32:12,888 --> 02:32:15,347
I will. I's had enough
of them Carpetbaggers.

1917
02:32:15,599 --> 02:32:17,600
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.

1918
02:32:17,893 --> 02:32:19,476
Goodbye, Sam. Thank you.

1919
02:32:19,728 --> 02:32:22,771
Change your dress and go over
to Miss Melly's.

1920
02:32:23,064 --> 02:32:24,732
I've got to go
to a political meeting.

1921
02:32:24,983 --> 02:32:29,612
How can you go to a political meeting
after what I've been through?

1922
02:32:29,863 --> 02:32:32,615
Oh, sugar.
You're more scared than hurt.

1923
02:32:32,866 --> 02:32:34,533
Nobody cares about me.

1924
02:32:34,784 --> 02:32:37,786
You all act as though
it were nothing at all.

1925
02:32:58,808 --> 02:33:01,392
The men talk
about protecting our women...

1926
02:33:01,644 --> 02:33:05,813
...and then after what happened to me,
Frank went to a political meeting.

1927
02:33:09,610 --> 02:33:12,528
And if it won't pain you too much,
India Wilkes...

1928
02:33:12,738 --> 02:33:16,783
...tell me why you're staring at me.
Has my face gone green?

1929
02:33:16,992 --> 02:33:18,326
It won't pain me.

1930
02:33:18,619 --> 02:33:21,120
What happened today
was just what you deserved.

1931
02:33:21,330 --> 02:33:23,289
With any justice,
you'd have gotten worse.

1932
02:33:23,540 --> 02:33:26,542
India, hush up.
- Let her talk. She's always hated me.

1933
02:33:26,794 --> 02:33:30,338
Ever since I took Charles away,
though she won't admit it.

1934
02:33:30,631 --> 02:33:33,591
If she thought anybody'd notice,
she'd walk the street naked.

1935
02:33:33,801 --> 02:33:35,843
I do hate you!

1936
02:33:36,303 --> 02:33:39,514
You've done all you could to lower
the prestige of decent people.

1937
02:33:39,682 --> 02:33:41,516
Now you've endangered
the lives of our men...

1938
02:33:41,684 --> 02:33:43,393
...because they've got to...
India!

1939
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:47,313
We'd better not say any more,
or one of us will be saying too much.

1940
02:33:47,523 --> 02:33:50,024
What's going on
that I don't know about?

1941
02:33:50,484 --> 02:33:51,693
Shh!

1942
02:33:55,864 --> 02:33:59,033
Somebody's coming up the walk.
Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.

1943
02:34:00,494 --> 02:34:03,204
Will you hand me the pistol,
Mrs. Meade?

1944
02:34:09,461 --> 02:34:11,129
Whoever it is...

1945
02:34:11,672 --> 02:34:13,381
...we know nothing.

1946
02:34:16,844 --> 02:34:20,096
Where have they gone?
Tell me. It's life or death.

1947
02:34:20,347 --> 02:34:22,390
Don't tell him.
He's a Yankee spy.

1948
02:34:22,641 --> 02:34:24,225
Quickly. There may be time.

1949
02:34:25,227 --> 02:34:27,645
- How'd you know?
- I played poker with Yankees.

1950
02:34:27,896 --> 02:34:30,732
They knew there'd be trouble.
They sent the cavalry out.

1951
02:34:30,983 --> 02:34:32,817
Your men are walking
into a trap.

1952
02:34:33,068 --> 02:34:35,903
Don't tell him.
He's trying to trap you.

1953
02:34:38,532 --> 02:34:41,576
Out the Decatur road.
The old Sullivan plantation.

1954
02:34:41,827 --> 02:34:43,369
They're meeting in the cellar.

1955
02:34:43,579 --> 02:34:45,121
I'll do what I can.

1956
02:34:49,752 --> 02:34:52,795
What's this about?
If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy.

1957
02:34:52,963 --> 02:34:54,714
We thought it best not to tell you.

1958
02:34:54,923 --> 02:34:58,760
The men have gone to clean out
the woods where you were attacked.

1959
02:34:59,053 --> 02:35:02,221
It's what many of our Southern men
have had to do to protect us.

1960
02:35:02,431 --> 02:35:07,018
And if they're captured, they'll be
hanged. And it will be your fault.

1961
02:35:07,269 --> 02:35:09,020
Another word and you leave, India.

1962
02:35:09,271 --> 02:35:11,230
Scarlett did what she had to do.

1963
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:14,275
Our men are doing
what they think they have to do.

1964
02:35:14,902 --> 02:35:16,194
Frank...

1965
02:35:16,612 --> 02:35:18,279
...and Ashley.

1966
02:35:20,241 --> 02:35:22,659
Oh, it isn't possible.

1967
02:35:25,455 --> 02:35:27,915
There's horses, Miss Melly.
Here they come.

1968
02:35:28,124 --> 02:35:30,167
We're sewing, we're sewing!

1969
02:35:34,547 --> 02:35:35,589
Open the door.

1970
02:35:46,059 --> 02:35:47,893
Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.

1971
02:35:50,313 --> 02:35:51,814
Who is Mrs. Wilkes?

1972
02:35:51,981 --> 02:35:53,732
I am Mrs. Wilkes.

1973
02:35:53,942 --> 02:35:57,236
- I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes.
- He's not here.

1974
02:35:57,821 --> 02:36:00,823
- Are you sure?
- Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word!

1975
02:36:01,074 --> 02:36:03,325
I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.

1976
02:36:03,493 --> 02:36:05,827
If you give me your word,
I won't search the house.

1977
02:36:06,203 --> 02:36:09,997
Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting
at Mr. Kennedy's store.

1978
02:36:10,207 --> 02:36:14,460
He's not at the store. There's no
meeting tonight, no political meeting.

1979
02:36:14,837 --> 02:36:17,922
We'll wait outside till
he and his friends return.

1980
02:36:18,966 --> 02:36:21,801
Surround the house.
Put a man on each door and window.

1981
02:36:27,599 --> 02:36:30,017
Keep on with your sewing, ladies.

1982
02:36:30,310 --> 02:36:32,854
And I'll read aloud.

1983
02:36:36,150 --> 02:36:40,027
"The Personal History and Experience
of David Copperfield.

1984
02:36:42,364 --> 02:36:43,781
Chapter One.

1985
02:36:43,991 --> 02:36:45,032
I am born.

1986
02:36:49,621 --> 02:36:54,000
To begin my life with the beginning
of my life, I record that I was born... "

1987
02:36:54,293 --> 02:36:56,544
"Chapter Nine.
I have a memorable birthday.

1988
02:36:56,837 --> 02:36:58,796
I pass over all that happened
at school...

1989
02:36:59,006 --> 02:37:03,050
...until the anniversary
of my birthday came round in March.

1990
02:37:03,469 --> 02:37:07,013
Except that Steerforth was more to be
admired than ever, I remember nothing.

1991
02:37:07,389 --> 02:37:09,557
He was going away
at the end of the half-year...

1992
02:37:09,850 --> 02:37:14,228
...if not sooner, and was more
spirited and independent than before.

1993
02:37:16,857 --> 02:37:19,400
But beyond this,
I remember nothing.

1994
02:37:19,693 --> 02:37:20,902
The great... "

1995
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:24,572
"I remember nothing. "

1996
02:37:29,495 --> 02:37:31,496
Melly, they're drunk!

1997
02:37:31,997 --> 02:37:35,833
Leave this to me, Scarlett.
And, please, say nothing.

1998
02:37:38,921 --> 02:37:41,339
- You stupid fool!
- Shh!

1999
02:37:42,591 --> 02:37:43,841
Quiet!

2000
02:37:44,551 --> 02:37:46,552
Will you shut up, for the love of...

2001
02:37:46,720 --> 02:37:47,803
Hello, Melly.

2002
02:37:48,013 --> 02:37:52,433
So you've got my husband
intoxicated again. Well, bring him in.

2003
02:37:52,684 --> 02:37:54,936
I'm sorry,
your husband's under arrest.

2004
02:37:55,187 --> 02:37:59,690
If you arrest all the drunks in Atlanta,
you must arrest a good many Yankees.

2005
02:37:59,900 --> 02:38:03,444
Bring him in, Captain Butler,
if you can walk yourself.

2006
02:38:04,571 --> 02:38:06,113
- Wait.
- I wanna tell you a story.

2007
02:38:06,406 --> 02:38:07,740
Listen, doctor, I...

2008
02:38:07,950 --> 02:38:09,909
Put him down in that chair.

2009
02:38:13,288 --> 02:38:15,706
Now, captain,
please leave my house...

2010
02:38:15,916 --> 02:38:18,459
...and try to remember
not to come here again.

2011
02:38:18,710 --> 02:38:21,546
That's fine thanks I get
for bringing him home...

2012
02:38:21,755 --> 02:38:24,423
...and not leaving him
in this shameful condition.

2013
02:38:24,633 --> 02:38:26,342
Now, boys, all together...

2014
02:38:26,552 --> 02:38:28,386
Dr. Meade!

2015
02:38:28,720 --> 02:38:30,888
I'm astonished at you!

2016
02:38:36,979 --> 02:38:38,104
Oh, Ashley!

2017
02:38:38,355 --> 02:38:40,565
How can you do this to me?

2018
02:38:41,441 --> 02:38:43,901
I ain't so very drunk, Melly.

2019
02:38:44,278 --> 02:38:46,779
Take him to the bedroom.
Lay him out on the bed.

2020
02:38:46,989 --> 02:38:49,574
- Don't touch him. He's under arrest.
- Now, Tom.

2021
02:38:49,825 --> 02:38:53,494
What do you want to arrest him for?
I've seen him drunker.

2022
02:38:53,787 --> 02:38:56,163
I've seen you drunker.
And you've seen me...

2023
02:38:56,456 --> 02:38:59,875
He can lie in the gutter for all I care.
I'm not a policeman.

2024
02:39:00,127 --> 02:39:04,422
He led a raid on that Shantytown
where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble.

2025
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:07,675
A lot of shanties were burned.
A couple of men were killed.

2026
02:39:07,926 --> 02:39:11,636
It's time you rebels learned you can't
take the law into your own hands.

2027
02:39:12,096 --> 02:39:13,930
What are you laughing at?

2028
02:39:15,349 --> 02:39:17,934
This isn't your night to teach
that lesson.

2029
02:39:18,185 --> 02:39:21,021
These two have been
with me tonight. Yes, sir.

2030
02:39:21,314 --> 02:39:23,106
With you, Rhett?

2031
02:39:23,608 --> 02:39:24,983
Where?

2032
02:39:28,696 --> 02:39:31,031
I don't like to say
in the presence of ladies.

2033
02:39:31,616 --> 02:39:32,699
You'd better say.

2034
02:39:33,409 --> 02:39:35,368
Come out on the porch
and I'll tell you.

2035
02:39:35,536 --> 02:39:39,372
Speak out. I think I have a right
to know where my husband's been.

2036
02:39:41,709 --> 02:39:43,126
Well, ma'am...

2037
02:39:43,336 --> 02:39:46,046
...we dropped in on a friend of mine...

2038
02:39:46,339 --> 02:39:47,922
...and the captain's.

2039
02:39:48,132 --> 02:39:49,466
A Mrs. Belle Watling.

2040
02:39:50,718 --> 02:39:55,472
We played cards
and drank champagne, and, well...

2041
02:39:55,723 --> 02:39:59,351
Now you've done it. Did you have
to show me up in front of my wife?

2042
02:40:00,811 --> 02:40:02,563
Now, I hope you're satisfied.

2043
02:40:02,814 --> 02:40:05,816
These ladies won't be speaking
with their husbands.

2044
02:40:06,401 --> 02:40:09,528
Well, Rhett, I had no idea.

2045
02:40:10,906 --> 02:40:16,035
Look here, will you take an oath that
they were with you tonight at Belle's?

2046
02:40:16,453 --> 02:40:19,330
Ask Belle if you don't believe me.
She'll tell you.

2047
02:40:19,581 --> 02:40:21,749
Will you give me your word,
as a gentleman?

2048
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,209
As a gentleman?

2049
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:25,461
Why, certainly, Tom.

2050
02:40:27,422 --> 02:40:31,217
Well, if I've made a mistake,
I'm sorry.

2051
02:40:32,010 --> 02:40:34,595
I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes.

2052
02:40:36,098 --> 02:40:37,932
If you'll leave us in peace.

2053
02:40:38,266 --> 02:40:40,768
Well, I say I'm sorry.

2054
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:43,437
Well, I am sorry.

2055
02:40:43,689 --> 02:40:45,272
Come on, sergeant.

2056
02:40:51,988 --> 02:40:54,448
Lock that door. Pull down the shades.

2057
02:40:54,866 --> 02:40:56,951
- Oh!
- Ashley!

2058
02:40:57,202 --> 02:40:59,453
He's all right.
It's only in the shoulder.

2059
02:40:59,705 --> 02:41:02,081
Get him on the bed
where I can dress the wound.

2060
02:41:02,290 --> 02:41:04,250
I think I can walk.

2061
02:41:04,626 --> 02:41:06,460
It's not worth the effort.
Which way?

2062
02:41:06,712 --> 02:41:08,003
In here.

2063
02:41:09,423 --> 02:41:10,965
Mammy, I want hot water.

2064
02:41:11,383 --> 02:41:12,800
And lint for bandages.

2065
02:41:13,009 --> 02:41:15,720
What can I use for a probe?
If I only had my bag.

2066
02:41:15,971 --> 02:41:19,056
Were you really there?
What did it look like?

2067
02:41:19,307 --> 02:41:23,227
Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,
plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?

2068
02:41:23,478 --> 02:41:26,564
Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,
remember yourself.

2069
02:41:28,608 --> 02:41:31,902
Captain Butler, tell me what happened,
all that happened.

2070
02:41:32,154 --> 02:41:33,821
I was too late.

2071
02:41:34,114 --> 02:41:37,616
When I got to the Sullivan place,
there had already been a skirmish.

2072
02:41:37,826 --> 02:41:40,745
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded,
and Dr. Meade was with him.

2073
02:41:40,954 --> 02:41:45,124
I had to prove they'd been somewhere,
anyplace but where they were.

2074
02:41:45,417 --> 02:41:48,502
- So I took them to Belle's.
- And she took them in?

2075
02:41:48,754 --> 02:41:51,297
She's by way of being
an old friend of mine.

2076
02:41:51,465 --> 02:41:53,257
Oh, I'm sorry...

2077
02:41:53,467 --> 02:41:57,011
I'm sorry I couldn't think up
a more dignified alibi.

2078
02:42:00,140 --> 02:42:03,684
This isn't the first time you've come
between me and disaster.

2079
02:42:03,935 --> 02:42:07,438
It isn't likely that I'd question
any device of yours.

2080
02:42:08,940 --> 02:42:12,859
And now I'll go and see
what Dr. Meade needs.

2081
02:42:17,865 --> 02:42:19,449
Oh, Ashley...

2082
02:42:20,993 --> 02:42:22,660
Ashley...

2083
02:42:24,121 --> 02:42:27,373
Have you no interest in what's
become of your own husband?

2084
02:42:30,336 --> 02:42:32,670
Did Frank go with you
to Belle Watling's?

2085
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:34,339
No.

2086
02:42:34,632 --> 02:42:35,673
Well, where is he?

2087
02:42:36,675 --> 02:42:39,344
He's lying out on Decatur Road...

2088
02:42:39,637 --> 02:42:41,638
...shot through the head.

2089
02:42:42,223 --> 02:42:43,723
He's dead.

2090
02:42:53,567 --> 02:42:54,818
Who is it?

2091
02:42:55,069 --> 02:42:56,236
It's Mrs. Watling.

2092
02:42:56,403 --> 02:42:59,239
Oh, Mrs. Watling.
Won't you come in the house?

2093
02:42:59,532 --> 02:43:02,408
Oh, no, I couldn't do that,
Mrs. Wilkes.

2094
02:43:02,660 --> 02:43:05,203
You come in and sit a minute with me.

2095
02:43:13,003 --> 02:43:16,756
How can I thank you enough
for what you did for us?

2096
02:43:17,049 --> 02:43:20,051
I got your note saying you would
call on me and thank me.

2097
02:43:20,261 --> 02:43:23,429
Why, Mrs. Wilkes,
you must have lost your mind.

2098
02:43:23,722 --> 02:43:27,725
I came as soon as it was dark to say
you mustn't think of any such thing.

2099
02:43:27,935 --> 02:43:29,602
Why, I'm...

2100
02:43:29,895 --> 02:43:31,271
Well, you're...

2101
02:43:31,564 --> 02:43:33,147
It wouldn't be fitting at all.

2102
02:43:33,357 --> 02:43:37,151
It wouldn't be fitting for me to thank
a woman who saved my husband's life?

2103
02:43:37,403 --> 02:43:42,282
Mrs. Wilkes, there ain't never been
a lady nice to me like you was.

2104
02:43:42,533 --> 02:43:45,243
I mean, about the money
for the hospital.

2105
02:43:45,452 --> 02:43:47,120
I don't forget a kindness.

2106
02:43:47,621 --> 02:43:50,456
I thought about you being widowed
with a little boy...

2107
02:43:50,749 --> 02:43:52,750
...if Mr. Wilkes got hung.

2108
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:56,296
He's a nice little boy,
your boy is, Mrs. Wilkes.

2109
02:43:56,755 --> 02:43:59,299
I got a boy myself, so I...

2110
02:43:59,717 --> 02:44:02,260
You have? Does he live...?

2111
02:44:02,469 --> 02:44:05,054
Oh, no, he ain't here in Atlanta.

2112
02:44:05,472 --> 02:44:07,181
He ain't never been here.

2113
02:44:07,433 --> 02:44:09,434
He's off at school.

2114
02:44:09,810 --> 02:44:12,312
I ain't seen him since he was little.

2115
02:44:14,899 --> 02:44:18,943
Anyways, if it had been that
Mrs. Kennedy's husband by hisself...

2116
02:44:19,194 --> 02:44:22,405
...I wouldn't have lifted a finger,
no matter what Rhett said.

2117
02:44:22,656 --> 02:44:24,490
She's a mighty cold woman...

2118
02:44:24,742 --> 02:44:27,160
...prancing about Atlanta by herself.

2119
02:44:27,328 --> 02:44:30,079
She killed her husband
same as if she shot him.

2120
02:44:30,331 --> 02:44:33,625
You mustn't say unkind things
about my sister-in-law.

2121
02:44:34,168 --> 02:44:35,960
Oh.

2122
02:44:36,629 --> 02:44:38,755
Please don't freeze me, Mrs. Wilkes.

2123
02:44:39,006 --> 02:44:41,341
I forgot how you liked her.

2124
02:44:41,842 --> 02:44:46,347
She just ain't in the same class with you,
and I can't help it if I think so.

2125
02:44:46,848 --> 02:44:49,725
Well, anyways, I gotta be going.

2126
02:44:49,976 --> 02:44:53,687
I'm scared somebody'll recognize
this carriage if I stay any longer.

2127
02:44:53,939 --> 02:44:56,148
That wouldn't do you no good.

2128
02:44:56,524 --> 02:44:59,860
And, Mrs. Wilkes, if you ever see me
on the street...

2129
02:45:00,111 --> 02:45:02,363
...you don't have to speak to me.

2130
02:45:02,614 --> 02:45:04,281
I'll understand.

2131
02:45:04,532 --> 02:45:06,784
I should be proud to speak to you.

2132
02:45:06,993 --> 02:45:09,495
Proud to be under obligation to you.

2133
02:45:09,746 --> 02:45:11,288
I hope we meet again.

2134
02:45:11,539 --> 02:45:14,625
Oh, no. That wouldn't be fitting.

2135
02:45:16,002 --> 02:45:19,295
- Good night, Mrs. Wilkes.
- Good night, Mrs. Watling.

2136
02:45:24,259 --> 02:45:26,177
And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.

2137
02:45:26,387 --> 02:45:29,055
She's brokenhearted about her husband.

2138
02:46:12,933 --> 02:46:14,559
Great balls of fire!

2139
02:46:14,810 --> 02:46:16,227
It's Rhett.

2140
02:46:41,545 --> 02:46:46,049
Captain Butler's here.
I told him you was prostrate with grief.

2141
02:46:46,300 --> 02:46:49,802
Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.

2142
02:47:19,583 --> 02:47:21,084
She says she's coming.

2143
02:47:21,251 --> 02:47:23,419
I don't know why she's coming,
but she's coming.

2144
02:47:23,670 --> 02:47:25,004
You don't like me, Mammy.

2145
02:47:25,297 --> 02:47:28,382
Don't you argue with me.
You don't. You really don't.

2146
02:47:40,646 --> 02:47:42,605
It's no good, Scarlett.

2147
02:47:42,856 --> 02:47:45,274
- What?
- The cologne.

2148
02:47:46,151 --> 02:47:47,693
I don't know what you mean.

2149
02:47:47,945 --> 02:47:51,989
I mean you've been drinking.
Brandy. Quite a lot.

2150
02:47:52,199 --> 02:47:55,493
Well, what if I have?
Is that any of your affair?

2151
02:47:57,162 --> 02:47:58,704
Don't drink alone.

2152
02:47:58,997 --> 02:48:02,917
People always find out,
and it ruins a reputation.

2153
02:48:08,382 --> 02:48:11,551
What is it?
This is more than losing old Frank.

2154
02:48:11,718 --> 02:48:14,679
Oh, Rhett, I'm so afraid.

2155
02:48:14,930 --> 02:48:17,431
I don't believe it.
You've never been afraid.

2156
02:48:17,683 --> 02:48:19,183
I'm afraid now.

2157
02:48:19,434 --> 02:48:21,394
I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.

2158
02:48:23,396 --> 02:48:26,148
You look pretty healthy.
And maybe there isn't any hell.

2159
02:48:26,357 --> 02:48:30,318
Oh, there is. I know there is.
I was raised on it.

2160
02:48:30,528 --> 02:48:33,697
Far be it from me to question
the teachings of childhood.

2161
02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:37,826
Tell me what you've done
that hell yawns before you.

2162
02:48:38,494 --> 02:48:40,996
I ought never to have married Frank.

2163
02:48:41,247 --> 02:48:44,416
He was Suellen's beau,
and he loved her, not me.

2164
02:48:44,667 --> 02:48:47,669
And I made him miserable,
and I killed him.

2165
02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:50,338
Yes, I did. I killed him.

2166
02:48:51,757 --> 02:48:53,884
Rhett, for the first time...

2167
02:48:54,093 --> 02:48:57,846
...I'm finding out what it is
to be sorry for something I've done.

2168
02:48:58,556 --> 02:49:00,932
Here. Dry your eyes.

2169
02:49:01,684 --> 02:49:04,561
If you had it all to do over again,
you'd do no differently.

2170
02:49:04,770 --> 02:49:07,439
You're like the thief
who isn't sorry he stole...

2171
02:49:07,607 --> 02:49:09,983
...but he's terribly sorry
he's going to jail.

2172
02:49:10,234 --> 02:49:12,986
I'm glad Mother's dead.

2173
02:49:13,237 --> 02:49:16,615
I'm glad she's dead
so she can't see me.

2174
02:49:16,782 --> 02:49:20,577
I always wanted to be like her,
calm and kind...

2175
02:49:20,786 --> 02:49:24,122
...and sadly, I've turned out
disappointing.

2176
02:49:25,208 --> 02:49:29,754
You know, Scarlett, I think
you're on the verge of a crying jag.

2177
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:39,805
So I'll change the subject
and say what I came to say.

2178
02:49:40,057 --> 02:49:42,058
Say it, then, and get out!

2179
02:49:43,060 --> 02:49:46,604
- What is it?
- I can't go on any longer without you.

2180
02:49:46,772 --> 02:49:50,816
Oh! You really are the most ill-bred man
to come here at a time...

2181
02:49:51,068 --> 02:49:53,778
I made up my mind you were
the only woman for me...

2182
02:49:54,029 --> 02:49:55,446
...the first day I saw you.

2183
02:49:55,656 --> 02:49:57,657
Now you have a mill
and Frank's money...

2184
02:49:57,950 --> 02:50:00,159
...and won't come to me
as you did to the jail.

2185
02:50:00,410 --> 02:50:04,789
- So I see I shall have to marry you.
- I never heard of such bad taste.

2186
02:50:04,998 --> 02:50:07,124
Would you be convinced
if I fell to my knees?

2187
02:50:07,501 --> 02:50:09,085
Turn me loose and get out.

2188
02:50:09,336 --> 02:50:12,296
Forgive me for startling you
with my impetuous sentiments...

2189
02:50:12,547 --> 02:50:15,049
...my dear Scarlett...
I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.

2190
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:18,261
But you must have noticed
that for some time...

2191
02:50:18,512 --> 02:50:21,806
...the friendship I've felt for you
has ripened into a deeper feeling.

2192
02:50:22,057 --> 02:50:26,269
A feeling more beautiful,
more pure, more sacred...

2193
02:50:26,478 --> 02:50:28,604
Dare I name it? Can it be love?

2194
02:50:29,273 --> 02:50:31,691
Get up off your knees.
I don't like your common jokes.

2195
02:50:31,984 --> 02:50:33,985
This is an honorable proposal
of marriage...

2196
02:50:34,194 --> 02:50:37,196
...made at what I consider
a most opportune moment.

2197
02:50:37,364 --> 02:50:40,700
I can't go all my life waiting
to catch you between husbands.

2198
02:50:40,951 --> 02:50:43,953
You're coarse and you're conceited.

2199
02:50:44,162 --> 02:50:47,123
And I think this conversation's
gone far enough.

2200
02:50:47,666 --> 02:50:50,501
Besides, I shall never marry again.

2201
02:50:51,128 --> 02:50:53,963
Oh, yes, you will.
And you'll marry me.

2202
02:50:54,214 --> 02:50:56,215
You? You?

2203
02:50:56,717 --> 02:50:58,342
I don't love you.

2204
02:50:58,593 --> 02:51:01,512
And I don't like being married.

2205
02:51:01,722 --> 02:51:03,973
Ever think of marrying
just for fun?

2206
02:51:04,224 --> 02:51:05,641
Marriage, fun?

2207
02:51:05,851 --> 02:51:08,561
Fiddle-dee-dee!
Fun for men, you mean.

2208
02:51:08,812 --> 02:51:10,354
Do you want them to hear you?

2209
02:51:10,605 --> 02:51:12,857
You've been married
to a boy and an old man.

2210
02:51:13,108 --> 02:51:16,736
Why not try a husband of the right age,
with a way with women?

2211
02:51:16,987 --> 02:51:19,196
You're a fool, Rhett Butler...

2212
02:51:19,406 --> 02:51:22,533
...when you know I shall always love
another man.

2213
02:51:22,826 --> 02:51:25,036
Stop it. You hear me? Stop it.

2214
02:51:25,245 --> 02:51:27,120
No more of that talk.

2215
02:51:32,501 --> 02:51:33,835
Don't. I shall faint.

2216
02:51:34,086 --> 02:51:36,755
I want you to faint.
This is what you're meant for.

2217
02:51:37,006 --> 02:51:39,549
None of those fools
have kissed you like this.

2218
02:51:39,759 --> 02:51:43,178
Your Charles or your Frank
or your stupid Ashley.

2219
02:51:50,936 --> 02:51:54,022
Say you're going to marry me.
Say yes. Say yes.

2220
02:51:54,273 --> 02:51:55,690
Yes.

2221
02:51:57,443 --> 02:52:00,111
Are you sure you meant it?
You don't want to take it back?

2222
02:52:00,279 --> 02:52:01,571
No.

2223
02:52:01,781 --> 02:52:04,282
Look at me,
and try to tell me the truth.

2224
02:52:04,533 --> 02:52:06,951
Did you say yes because of my money?

2225
02:52:07,244 --> 02:52:10,121
Well, yes, partly.

2226
02:52:11,123 --> 02:52:12,374
Partly?

2227
02:52:12,792 --> 02:52:15,293
Well, you know, Rhett,
money does help.

2228
02:52:15,586 --> 02:52:18,671
- And, of course, I am fond of you.
- Fond of me?

2229
02:52:18,923 --> 02:52:22,384
If I said I was madly in love
with you, you'd know I was lying.

2230
02:52:22,593 --> 02:52:26,262
- You say we have a lot in common...
- Yes, you're right, my dear.

2231
02:52:26,472 --> 02:52:28,640
I'm not in love
any more than you are.

2232
02:52:28,808 --> 02:52:31,601
Heaven help the man
who ever really loves you.

2233
02:52:31,811 --> 02:52:33,645
What kind of ring would you like?

2234
02:52:33,896 --> 02:52:36,815
A diamond ring,
and do buy a great big one.

2235
02:52:37,066 --> 02:52:40,110
You'll have the biggest
and most vulgar ring in Atlanta.

2236
02:52:40,319 --> 02:52:43,988
I'll take you to New Orleans
for the most expensive honeymoon.

2237
02:52:44,240 --> 02:52:47,659
- That'd be heavenly.
- I'll buy your trousseau for you too.

2238
02:52:47,910 --> 02:52:49,994
How wonderful...

2239
02:52:50,287 --> 02:52:52,664
...but you won't tell anybody,
will you?

2240
02:52:52,915 --> 02:52:55,333
Still the little hypocrite.

2241
02:52:57,294 --> 02:52:59,087
Won't you kiss me goodbye?

2242
02:52:59,338 --> 02:53:01,840
You've had enough kissing
for one afternoon.

2243
02:53:02,091 --> 02:53:05,468
You're impossible. You can go.
I don't care if you never come back.

2244
02:53:05,719 --> 02:53:07,637
But I will come back.

2245
02:53:22,027 --> 02:53:23,945
What are you thinking about, Scarlett?

2246
02:53:24,196 --> 02:53:26,823
I'm thinking about how rich we are.

2247
02:53:28,117 --> 02:53:30,201
I can keep the lumber business too?

2248
02:53:30,453 --> 02:53:32,871
Yes, of course you can,
if it amuses you.

2249
02:53:33,122 --> 02:53:37,250
Now that you're so rich, you can tell
everybody to go to the devil.

2250
02:53:37,460 --> 02:53:40,545
But you were the main one
I wanted to go to the devil.

2251
02:53:57,855 --> 02:54:01,399
Don't scrape the plate.
I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.

2252
02:54:01,567 --> 02:54:05,487
Oh, Rhett, can I have
a chocolate one stuffed with meringue?

2253
02:54:05,738 --> 02:54:08,781
If you don't stop being a glutton,
you'll get as fat as Mammy.

2254
02:54:09,033 --> 02:54:10,659
And I'll divorce you.

2255
02:54:11,369 --> 02:54:13,787
It'd be nice if you bought
something for Mammy.

2256
02:54:14,039 --> 02:54:17,541
Why should I buy her a present
when she called us both mules?

2257
02:54:17,792 --> 02:54:19,210
Mules? Why mules?

2258
02:54:19,419 --> 02:54:24,006
She said we could give ourselves air
and get slicked up like racehorses...

2259
02:54:24,257 --> 02:54:27,927
...but we were just mules in horse
harness and we didn't fool anybody.

2260
02:54:28,220 --> 02:54:31,721
I never heard anything more true.
Mammy's a smart old soul.

2261
02:54:31,931 --> 02:54:35,850
And one of the few people I know
whose respect I'd like to have.

2262
02:54:36,435 --> 02:54:40,021
- I won't give her a thing.
- Then I'll take her a petticoat.

2263
02:54:40,231 --> 02:54:42,357
My mammy said
when she went to heaven...

2264
02:54:42,525 --> 02:54:46,611
...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat
so stiff that it'd stand by itself...

2265
02:54:46,862 --> 02:54:49,822
...and so rustley the Lord would say
it's made of angels' wings.

2266
02:54:50,032 --> 02:54:52,867
She won't take it from you.
She'd rather die than wear it.

2267
02:54:53,118 --> 02:54:56,704
That may be. But I'm making
the gesture just the same.

2268
02:55:00,543 --> 02:55:02,961
Wake up. Wake up!

2269
02:55:04,463 --> 02:55:06,923
You were having another nightmare.

2270
02:55:07,466 --> 02:55:08,925
Oh, Rhett.

2271
02:55:09,093 --> 02:55:13,221
Rhett, I was so cold
and hungry and so tired.

2272
02:55:13,472 --> 02:55:17,976
I couldn't find it. I ran through
the mist and I couldn't find it.

2273
02:55:18,269 --> 02:55:20,895
- Find what, honey?
- I don't know.

2274
02:55:21,105 --> 02:55:23,982
I always dream the same dream,
and I never know.

2275
02:55:24,233 --> 02:55:26,234
It seems to be hidden in the mist.

2276
02:55:26,485 --> 02:55:27,986
Darling...

2277
02:55:28,654 --> 02:55:33,616
Oh, Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream
that I found it, and that I'm safe?

2278
02:55:34,118 --> 02:55:36,119
Dreams don't work that way.

2279
02:55:36,370 --> 02:55:38,621
But when you get used
to being safe and warm...

2280
02:55:38,831 --> 02:55:40,957
...you'll stop dreaming that dream.

2281
02:55:41,166 --> 02:55:44,961
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see
that you are safe.

2282
02:55:46,338 --> 02:55:50,925
Rhett, would you do something for me
if I asked you?

2283
02:55:51,176 --> 02:55:53,011
You know I would.

2284
02:55:53,637 --> 02:55:55,763
Will you take me away from here?

2285
02:55:56,181 --> 02:55:59,684
- Don't you like New Orleans?
- I love New Orleans...

2286
02:55:59,893 --> 02:56:02,520
...but I want to go home
and visit Tara.

2287
02:56:02,771 --> 02:56:04,897
Will you take me to Tara?

2288
02:56:05,149 --> 02:56:07,942
Yes, Scarlett. Of course I will.

2289
02:56:08,694 --> 02:56:10,528
We'll go tomorrow.

2290
02:56:13,032 --> 02:56:15,700
You get your strength
from this red earth of Tara.

2291
02:56:15,951 --> 02:56:17,702
You're part of it
and it's part of you.

2292
02:56:17,995 --> 02:56:21,623
I'd give anything to have Tara
the way it was before the war.

2293
02:56:21,874 --> 02:56:23,041
Would you?

2294
02:56:23,417 --> 02:56:26,419
Go ahead and make it that way.
Spend whatever you want.

2295
02:56:26,670 --> 02:56:28,963
Make it as fine a plantation
as it ever was.

2296
02:56:29,131 --> 02:56:30,882
Oh, Rhett!

2297
02:56:31,216 --> 02:56:32,842
Rhett, you are good to me.

2298
02:56:33,052 --> 02:56:35,219
Can we still have our big new house
in Atlanta?

2299
02:56:35,512 --> 02:56:38,222
Yes. And it can be
as ornate as you want.

2300
02:56:38,474 --> 02:56:40,725
Marble terraces,
stained-glass windows.

2301
02:56:41,018 --> 02:56:42,685
Won't everyone be jealous!

2302
02:56:42,936 --> 02:56:47,023
I want everybody who's been mean
to me to be pea-green with envy.

2303
02:56:47,900 --> 02:56:49,734
I don't care. Scarlett's hateful...

2304
02:56:50,027 --> 02:56:52,236
...building that new house
just to show off!

2305
02:56:52,446 --> 02:56:55,156
And even taking our servants!

2306
02:56:55,407 --> 02:56:58,534
Oh, darling, you mustn't think
unkindly of her.

2307
02:56:58,744 --> 02:57:01,579
She's made it possible for us
to keep Tara, always.

2308
02:57:01,872 --> 02:57:03,706
Yes, and what good is Tara?

2309
02:57:03,957 --> 02:57:08,503
She's had three husbands,
and I'll be an old maid!

2310
02:57:10,464 --> 02:57:12,715
Great Jehoshaphat!

2311
02:57:13,175 --> 02:57:14,926
Great Jehoshaphat!

2312
02:57:15,386 --> 02:57:18,096
Lordy, we sure is rich now.

2313
02:57:19,056 --> 02:57:21,557
That's ridiculous!
Why can't I go in?

2314
02:57:21,725 --> 02:57:24,352
I'm entitled to at least see
what my own child looks like.

2315
02:57:24,561 --> 02:57:28,272
You control yourself.
You'll be seeing it for a long time.

2316
02:57:28,899 --> 02:57:31,693
I'd like to apologize
about its not being a boy.

2317
02:57:31,944 --> 02:57:33,986
Oh, hush your mouth.
Who wants a boy?

2318
02:57:34,238 --> 02:57:37,239
Boys aren't any use.
Don't you think I'm proof of that?

2319
02:57:38,116 --> 02:57:39,950
Have a drink of sherry.

2320
02:57:40,118 --> 02:57:42,494
Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?

2321
02:57:42,745 --> 02:57:44,788
She sure is.

2322
02:57:45,081 --> 02:57:46,623
You ever see a prettier one?

2323
02:57:46,874 --> 02:57:51,253
Miss Scarlett was mighty near that
pretty when she come, but not quite.

2324
02:57:51,504 --> 02:57:52,921
Have another glass.

2325
02:57:55,466 --> 02:57:57,092
Mammy?

2326
02:57:57,301 --> 02:57:59,136
What's that rustling noise I hear?

2327
02:57:59,429 --> 02:58:03,473
Lordy, that ain't nothing but my
red silk petticoat you done give me.

2328
02:58:03,641 --> 02:58:07,769
Nothing but your petticoat?
I don't believe it. Pull up your skirt.

2329
02:58:08,604 --> 02:58:11,064
Mr. Rhett, you is bad.

2330
02:58:11,274 --> 02:58:13,316
Yea, Lordy!

2331
02:58:18,322 --> 02:58:21,158
You sure took a long enough time
about wearing it.

2332
02:58:21,534 --> 02:58:23,785
Yes, sir. Too long.

2333
02:58:23,995 --> 02:58:25,996
No more mule in horse's harness?

2334
02:58:26,247 --> 02:58:29,249
Mister Rhett, Miss Scarlett
was bad telling you about that.

2335
02:58:29,500 --> 02:58:32,127
You ain't holding that
against old Mammy, is you?

2336
02:58:32,545 --> 02:58:34,045
I don't hold it against you.

2337
02:58:34,297 --> 02:58:36,506
I just wanted to know.
Have another glass.

2338
02:58:36,674 --> 02:58:38,175
Here, take the whole bottle.

2339
02:58:38,342 --> 02:58:41,511
Dr. Meade says you can go in now,
Captain Butler.

2340
02:58:44,682 --> 02:58:46,767
This sure is a happy day to me.

2341
02:58:47,018 --> 02:58:50,061
I done diapered three generations
of this family's girls.

2342
02:58:50,271 --> 02:58:52,190
And it sure is a happy day.

2343
02:58:52,441 --> 02:58:57,361
Oh, yes, Mammy. The happiest days
are when babies come. I wish...

2344
02:58:57,696 --> 02:59:00,865
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.
What do you suppose they'll name her?

2345
02:59:01,158 --> 02:59:03,201
Miss Scarlett done told me
if it was a girl...

2346
02:59:03,494 --> 02:59:07,371
...she was going to name it
Eugenia Victoria.

2347
02:59:07,539 --> 02:59:11,167
Yes, she's a beautiful baby.

2348
02:59:11,376 --> 02:59:13,878
The most beautiful baby ever.

2349
02:59:14,463 --> 02:59:16,172
Yes...

2350
02:59:17,633 --> 02:59:20,343
Do you know that this is
your birthday?

2351
02:59:20,594 --> 02:59:23,054
That you're a week old today?

2352
02:59:23,347 --> 02:59:27,099
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony,
the likes of which...

2353
02:59:27,309 --> 02:59:29,060
...this town has never seen.

2354
02:59:29,311 --> 02:59:32,814
Yes, I'm going to send her to
the best schools in Charleston.

2355
02:59:33,065 --> 02:59:37,610
Yes, and her will be received by
the best families in the South.

2356
02:59:37,820 --> 02:59:40,112
And when it comes time
for her to marry...

2357
02:59:40,364 --> 02:59:43,908
...well, she'll be a little princess.

2358
02:59:44,159 --> 02:59:46,202
Certainly making a fool of yourself.

2359
02:59:46,411 --> 02:59:47,620
Why shouldn't I?

2360
02:59:48,747 --> 02:59:52,625
She's the first person who's ever
completely belonged to me.

2361
02:59:53,085 --> 02:59:54,627
Great balls of fire!

2362
02:59:54,878 --> 02:59:56,712
I had the baby, didn't I?

2363
02:59:57,256 --> 02:59:59,757
It's Melanie. May I come in?
- Come in.

2364
03:00:00,092 --> 03:00:04,512
Yes, come in and look at
my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.

2365
03:00:05,848 --> 03:00:08,432
Most babies have blue eyes
when they're born.

2366
03:00:08,725 --> 03:00:11,519
Don't tell him anything.
He knows everything about babies.

2367
03:00:11,728 --> 03:00:14,856
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue
and they'll stay blue.

2368
03:00:15,107 --> 03:00:17,650
As blue as the Bonnie Blue flag.

2369
03:00:18,026 --> 03:00:20,027
That's it.
That's what we'll call her.

2370
03:00:20,529 --> 03:00:22,446
"Bonnie Blue Butler. "

2371
03:00:30,455 --> 03:00:32,248
Try again, Mammy.

2372
03:00:39,756 --> 03:00:41,047
Twenty inches.

2373
03:00:41,299 --> 03:00:44,759
Twenty inches.
I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.

2374
03:00:44,969 --> 03:00:47,304
You simply gotta make it 181/2 again.

2375
03:00:47,555 --> 03:00:48,930
You done had a baby.

2376
03:00:49,181 --> 03:00:51,975
And you ain't never gonna be
no 181/2 inches again.

2377
03:00:52,226 --> 03:00:54,144
There ain't nothing to do about it.

2378
03:00:55,229 --> 03:00:57,105
There is something to do about it.

2379
03:00:57,315 --> 03:01:00,609
I'm just not going to get old and fat
before my time.

2380
03:01:01,110 --> 03:01:03,486
I just won't have any more babies.

2381
03:01:03,988 --> 03:01:07,490
I heard Mr. Rhett say
that he'd be wanting a son next year.

2382
03:01:07,783 --> 03:01:10,452
Tell Captain Butler I decided
not to go out.

2383
03:01:10,703 --> 03:01:12,495
I'll have supper in my room.

2384
03:01:33,100 --> 03:01:34,809
I got your message.

2385
03:01:35,019 --> 03:01:37,729
I'll have them bring
my supper up here too.

2386
03:01:43,736 --> 03:01:45,445
No objections to that, I hope?

2387
03:01:45,655 --> 03:01:46,863
No.

2388
03:01:48,032 --> 03:01:50,033
Yes. Uh...

2389
03:01:51,118 --> 03:01:53,995
I mean, I don't care
where you have your supper.

2390
03:01:56,040 --> 03:01:57,165
Rhett...

2391
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,460
Yes?
- You see...

2392
03:02:00,670 --> 03:02:02,879
Well, I've decided...

2393
03:02:04,548 --> 03:02:07,467
Well, I hope I don't have
any more children.

2394
03:02:19,689 --> 03:02:23,233
My pet, as I told you
before Bonnie was born...

2395
03:02:23,484 --> 03:02:26,361
...it's immaterial to me
whether you have one child or 20.

2396
03:02:26,570 --> 03:02:28,405
No, but you know what I...

2397
03:02:28,864 --> 03:02:30,281
Do you know what I mean?

2398
03:02:30,533 --> 03:02:34,411
I do. And do you know
I can divorce you for this?

2399
03:02:34,912 --> 03:02:36,913
You're low enough to think of that.

2400
03:02:37,206 --> 03:02:39,708
If you had any chivalry in you,
or were nice...

2401
03:02:39,917 --> 03:02:44,254
Look at Ashley Wilkes. Melanie can't
have any more children and he...

2402
03:02:45,881 --> 03:02:48,425
You've been to the lumber office
this afternoon.

2403
03:02:48,676 --> 03:02:50,510
What has that got to do with it?

2404
03:02:51,929 --> 03:02:55,306
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.
Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler.

2405
03:02:55,558 --> 03:02:58,435
It's no use. You wouldn't understand.

2406
03:02:58,936 --> 03:03:02,105
- You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
- Sorry for me?

2407
03:03:02,356 --> 03:03:05,567
Yes, sorry for you because you throw
away happiness with both hands...

2408
03:03:05,735 --> 03:03:08,278
...and reach out for something
that'll never make you happy.

2409
03:03:08,446 --> 03:03:10,071
I don't know
what you're talking about.

2410
03:03:10,239 --> 03:03:14,534
If you were free and Melly were dead
and you had your precious Ashley...

2411
03:03:14,785 --> 03:03:16,786
...do you think you'd be happy?

2412
03:03:17,371 --> 03:03:20,957
You'd never know him,
never even understand his mind...

2413
03:03:21,208 --> 03:03:24,044
...any more than you understand
anything, except money.

2414
03:03:24,545 --> 03:03:26,129
Never mind about that. I want...

2415
03:03:26,422 --> 03:03:30,550
You may keep your sanctity.
It'll work no hardship on me.

2416
03:03:30,801 --> 03:03:32,052
You don't care?

2417
03:03:32,428 --> 03:03:34,637
The world is full
of many things and people...

2418
03:03:34,890 --> 03:03:38,476
...and I shan't be lonely.
I will find comfort elsewhere.

2419
03:03:38,727 --> 03:03:39,935
Well, that's fine.

2420
03:03:40,145 --> 03:03:43,731
But I warn you, in case you change
your mind, I intend to lock my door.

2421
03:03:43,940 --> 03:03:45,065
Why bother?

2422
03:03:45,316 --> 03:03:48,485
If I wanted to come in,
no lock could keep me out.

2423
03:04:06,003 --> 03:04:07,670
I knew most women were cheats...

2424
03:04:07,963 --> 03:04:10,173
...hypocritical and hard,
but this one...

2425
03:04:10,466 --> 03:04:12,675
- It ain't no use.
- What do you mean?

2426
03:04:12,968 --> 03:04:14,803
I mean you're poisoned with her.

2427
03:04:15,012 --> 03:04:18,515
I don't care what she's done to you.
You're still in love with her.

2428
03:04:18,766 --> 03:04:23,103
- It pleasures me none to say it.
- Maybe so, but I'm through with her.

2429
03:04:23,354 --> 03:04:27,273
You've gotta think of the child.
Child's worth 10 of the mother.

2430
03:04:33,322 --> 03:04:35,031
You're a shrewd woman, Belle.

2431
03:04:35,199 --> 03:04:37,033
And a very nice one.

2432
03:04:38,035 --> 03:04:39,035
Yes, Rhett?

2433
03:04:39,286 --> 03:04:42,705
I was just thinking of the difference
between you and...

2434
03:04:42,915 --> 03:04:45,708
You're both hardheaded businesswomen,
and successful.

2435
03:04:46,418 --> 03:04:48,545
But you've got a heart, Belle.

2436
03:04:50,047 --> 03:04:51,881
And you're honest.

2437
03:04:54,135 --> 03:04:55,301
Goodbye, Rhett.

2438
03:04:56,846 --> 03:04:58,138
Goodbye, Belle.

2439
03:05:13,737 --> 03:05:16,072
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman.

2440
03:05:16,240 --> 03:05:18,241
Look at those hands. And that seat!

2441
03:05:18,534 --> 03:05:19,868
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!

2442
03:05:20,077 --> 03:05:22,745
Why we have to wheel a baby
when we have servants...

2443
03:05:22,955 --> 03:05:25,915
- Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
Captain Butler.

2444
03:05:26,083 --> 03:05:27,208
Good morning, Scarlett.

2445
03:05:27,376 --> 03:05:30,086
Making fools of ourselves
in front of these buffaloes.

2446
03:05:30,337 --> 03:05:32,881
If you'd thought of your position,
you wouldn't have to.

2447
03:05:33,090 --> 03:05:38,178
But as it is, we're going to cultivate
every female dragon of the Old Guard...

2448
03:05:38,387 --> 03:05:41,514
- Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
Captain Butler.

2449
03:05:41,765 --> 03:05:43,725
Good morning, Scarlett.

2450
03:05:43,976 --> 03:05:47,103
So the millionaire speculator
is turning respectable.

2451
03:05:47,354 --> 03:05:49,439
Money can't buy
what I want for Bonnie.

2452
03:05:49,690 --> 03:05:51,774
I'll admit I've been at fault too.

2453
03:05:52,026 --> 03:05:54,110
Bonnie will have a place
among decent people.

2454
03:05:54,403 --> 03:05:58,615
Even if we both have to crawl
on our bellies to every fat old cat...

2455
03:05:58,908 --> 03:06:00,700
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.

2456
03:06:00,910 --> 03:06:04,454
Good morning, Captain
Butler. Good morning, Scarlett.

2457
03:06:09,877 --> 03:06:12,795
Mrs. Merriwether, I have
great regard for your knowledge.

2458
03:06:13,088 --> 03:06:15,632
- Could you give me some advice?
- Why, certainly.

2459
03:06:15,799 --> 03:06:18,051
My Bonnie sucks her thumb.
I can't stop her.

2460
03:06:18,302 --> 03:06:20,970
You should make her stop!
It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.

2461
03:06:21,138 --> 03:06:23,890
I know, I know.
She has such a beautiful mouth too.

2462
03:06:24,141 --> 03:06:26,643
- I tried putting soap on her nails.
Soap? Bah!

2463
03:06:26,894 --> 03:06:30,438
Put quinine on her thumb and
she'll stop sucking it quick enough.

2464
03:06:30,648 --> 03:06:33,274
Quinine! I never would have
thought of it.

2465
03:06:33,525 --> 03:06:35,443
I can't thank you enough.

2466
03:06:35,653 --> 03:06:38,154
You've taken a great load off my mind.

2467
03:06:38,405 --> 03:06:39,656
Good morning.

2468
03:06:42,493 --> 03:06:45,453
Good morning, Dolly.
Wasn't that Captain Butler?

2469
03:06:45,663 --> 03:06:48,331
Good morning, Caroline.
I was just thinking...

2470
03:06:48,624 --> 03:06:52,626
...there's a great deal of good in
a man who would love a child so much.

2471
03:06:52,835 --> 03:06:54,836
But of course there is.

2472
03:06:55,088 --> 03:06:59,299
Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that
Captain Butler finally admitted...

2473
03:06:59,509 --> 03:07:03,303
...that he was honored for his
services at the Battle of Franklin.

2474
03:07:03,554 --> 03:07:06,014
No, and did I tell you
that Captain Butler made...

2475
03:07:06,266 --> 03:07:10,560
...a stupendous contribution to the
Association for the Beautification...

2476
03:07:10,770 --> 03:07:13,063
...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
- No!

2477
03:07:14,190 --> 03:07:17,859
My grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,
is giving a party for Bonnie next week.

2478
03:07:18,152 --> 03:07:22,281
Why, Dolly Merriwether, it was
my idea to give a party for Bonnie.

2479
03:07:22,532 --> 03:07:26,201
Why, Caroline Meade,
how can you say a thing like that?

2480
03:07:32,959 --> 03:07:36,378
Watch Daddy put your pony
over it, Bonnie. Now, watch!

2481
03:07:39,173 --> 03:07:41,341
Daddy, let me! Let me!

2482
03:07:41,551 --> 03:07:42,801
All right, darling.

2483
03:07:43,052 --> 03:07:44,720
Put her on, Pork.

2484
03:07:47,682 --> 03:07:48,849
Up we go!

2485
03:07:49,100 --> 03:07:50,183
Oh, there!

2486
03:07:50,810 --> 03:07:53,186
Lordy mercy!
There he goes again.

2487
03:07:53,396 --> 03:07:56,398
Grip tightly with your legs.
Lean forward and go with him.

2488
03:07:56,649 --> 03:07:59,568
Hold your reins properly
in a firm hand. Up!

2489
03:08:00,653 --> 03:08:02,904
That was fine. I knew you'd do it.

2490
03:08:03,197 --> 03:08:05,824
When you're older,
I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.

2491
03:08:06,075 --> 03:08:10,203
You'll be the best horsewoman
in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.

2492
03:08:10,747 --> 03:08:12,331
Mr. Rhett? Mr. Rhett!

2493
03:08:13,166 --> 03:08:14,207
Mr. Rhett!

2494
03:08:15,251 --> 03:08:17,587
Did you see her?
Wasn't she wonderful?

2495
03:08:17,838 --> 03:08:20,340
Mr. Rhett, I done told you
and told you...

2496
03:08:20,591 --> 03:08:24,510
...it just ain't fittin' for a girl to ride
astraddle with her dress flying up.

2497
03:08:25,095 --> 03:08:27,263
All right. I'll teach her
to ride sidesaddle.

2498
03:08:27,514 --> 03:08:30,558
And I'll buy her a blue velvet
riding habit. She'll love that.

2499
03:08:30,851 --> 03:08:33,144
A nice black broadcloth
is what little girls wear.

2500
03:08:33,395 --> 03:08:35,646
Oh, now, Mammy,
be reasonable.

2501
03:08:35,856 --> 03:08:38,775
Well, I don't think it's fittin', but...

2502
03:08:40,152 --> 03:08:42,737
It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.

2503
03:08:44,031 --> 03:08:45,656
It ain't fittin'.

2504
03:08:55,459 --> 03:08:59,295
Why, Scarlett, what are you
doing downtown at this time of day?

2505
03:08:59,463 --> 03:09:00,463
Well, Ashley, I just...

2506
03:09:00,714 --> 03:09:03,966
Why aren't you helping Melly
with my surprise birthday party?

2507
03:09:04,259 --> 03:09:07,762
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't
supposed to know anything about that.

2508
03:09:07,971 --> 03:09:10,681
Melly'd be so disappointed
if you weren't surprised.

2509
03:09:10,933 --> 03:09:12,141
I won't let on.

2510
03:09:12,309 --> 03:09:14,769
I'll be the most surprised man
in Atlanta.

2511
03:09:14,937 --> 03:09:17,271
As long as you're here,
let me show you the books...

2512
03:09:17,439 --> 03:09:19,982
...so you can see how bad
a businessman I am.

2513
03:09:20,234 --> 03:09:23,820
Don't let's fool with any books today.
When I'm wearing a new bonnet...

2514
03:09:24,113 --> 03:09:26,989
...all the figures I ever knew
go right out of my head.

2515
03:09:27,241 --> 03:09:30,493
Figures are well lost when
the bonnet's as pretty as that.

2516
03:09:30,786 --> 03:09:34,497
Scarlett, you know,
you get prettier all the time.

2517
03:09:34,748 --> 03:09:38,835
You haven't changed a bit since
our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...

2518
03:09:39,128 --> 03:09:42,588
...where you sat under a tree
surrounded by dozens of beaus.

2519
03:09:44,133 --> 03:09:46,509
That girl doesn't exist anymore.

2520
03:09:47,177 --> 03:09:51,139
Nothing's turned out as I expected,
Ashley. Nothing.

2521
03:09:51,807 --> 03:09:55,934
Yes, we've traveled a long road
since the old days, haven't we?

2522
03:09:56,144 --> 03:09:57,769
Oh, the lazy days...

2523
03:09:58,020 --> 03:10:00,939
...the warm, still,
country twilight...

2524
03:10:01,441 --> 03:10:04,526
...the high, soft Negro laughter
from the quarters...

2525
03:10:05,361 --> 03:10:09,531
...the golden warmth and security
of those days.

2526
03:10:10,867 --> 03:10:12,826
Don't look back, Ashley.

2527
03:10:13,035 --> 03:10:14,870
Don't look back.

2528
03:10:16,247 --> 03:10:18,665
It drags at your heart till...

2529
03:10:18,958 --> 03:10:21,293
...you can't do anything
but look back.

2530
03:10:26,132 --> 03:10:28,467
I didn't mean to make you sad,
my dear.

2531
03:10:29,469 --> 03:10:33,263
I never want you to be anything
but completely happy.

2532
03:10:52,909 --> 03:10:54,242
Oh, Ashley!

2533
03:10:56,496 --> 03:10:59,331
- Who is it?
Only your husband.

2534
03:10:59,916 --> 03:11:01,416
Come in.

2535
03:11:02,001 --> 03:11:05,378
Am I actually being invited
into the sanctuary?

2536
03:11:06,214 --> 03:11:08,298
You're not ready for Melanie's party.

2537
03:11:08,508 --> 03:11:09,799
I've got a headache, Rhett.

2538
03:11:10,051 --> 03:11:13,512
You go without me
and make my excuses to Melanie.

2539
03:11:14,555 --> 03:11:17,307
What a white-livered
little coward you are!

2540
03:11:17,558 --> 03:11:20,519
Get up! You're going to that party
and you'll have to hurry.

2541
03:11:20,728 --> 03:11:22,312
- Has India dared...?
- Yes, India has.

2542
03:11:22,563 --> 03:11:25,857
- Everyone in town knows the story.
- Kill them for spreading lies.

2543
03:11:26,108 --> 03:11:28,735
I don't kill people who tell the truth.

2544
03:11:28,945 --> 03:11:30,028
No time to argue.

2545
03:11:30,279 --> 03:11:33,532
I won't go! I can't go until
this misunderstanding clears up.

2546
03:11:33,783 --> 03:11:37,410
You won't cheat Melly out of publicly
ordering you out of her house.

2547
03:11:37,620 --> 03:11:41,248
There was nothing wrong.
India hates me so. I can't go.

2548
03:11:41,457 --> 03:11:44,918
If you don't show your face tonight,
you'll never be able to again.

2549
03:11:45,127 --> 03:11:47,712
I don't care, but you won't ruin
Bonnie's chances.

2550
03:11:47,964 --> 03:11:50,840
You're going to that party,
for her sake. Get dressed.

2551
03:12:04,855 --> 03:12:08,567
Wear that. Nothing modest
or matronly will do for this occasion.

2552
03:12:08,776 --> 03:12:12,737
And put on plenty of rouge.
I want you to look your part tonight.

2553
03:12:19,120 --> 03:12:21,663
For he's a jolly good fellow

2554
03:12:21,956 --> 03:12:27,335
For he's a jolly good fellow

2555
03:12:27,503 --> 03:12:34,467
Which nobody can deny

2556
03:12:38,681 --> 03:12:40,932
- Good night, Scarlett.
- But, Rhett...

2557
03:12:41,183 --> 03:12:44,019
You're going into the arena alone.
The lions are hungry.

2558
03:12:44,312 --> 03:12:45,812
Don't leave me. Don't.

2559
03:12:46,022 --> 03:12:47,772
You're not afraid?

2560
03:13:13,924 --> 03:13:16,134
What a lovely dress, darling.

2561
03:13:16,385 --> 03:13:19,054
India wasn't able to come.
Will you be an angel?

2562
03:13:19,347 --> 03:13:23,224
I do need you to help me
receive my guests.

2563
03:13:25,686 --> 03:13:27,187
Mrs. Meade...

2564
03:13:27,480 --> 03:13:29,689
...here's our darling Scarlett.

2565
03:13:31,025 --> 03:13:33,193
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

2566
03:13:33,527 --> 03:13:35,654
- Why, Scarlett.
- Good evening.

2567
03:13:38,949 --> 03:13:42,827
Ashley, aren't you going to get
our Scarlett a glass of punch?

2568
03:13:50,044 --> 03:13:52,879
Did you have a good time
at Miss Melly's party?

2569
03:13:53,089 --> 03:13:55,757
Yes. Now, Mammy,
be sure and leave word.

2570
03:13:56,050 --> 03:13:59,386
If Captain Butler asks for me
when he comes back, I'm asleep.

2571
03:13:59,595 --> 03:14:00,720
Yes'm.

2572
03:14:30,042 --> 03:14:32,252
Come in, Mrs. Butler.

2573
03:14:40,803 --> 03:14:42,262
Come here.

2574
03:14:57,737 --> 03:14:59,154
Sit down.

2575
03:15:01,615 --> 03:15:05,118
No reason you shouldn't
have a nightcap, even if I am here.

2576
03:15:05,327 --> 03:15:07,287
I didn't want a drink.
I heard a noise...

2577
03:15:07,538 --> 03:15:09,622
You heard nothing of the kind.

2578
03:15:09,832 --> 03:15:12,500
You wouldn't have come
if you thought I was here.

2579
03:15:12,752 --> 03:15:14,836
- You must need a drink badly.
- I do not.

2580
03:15:15,045 --> 03:15:17,672
Take it. Don't give yourself airs.

2581
03:15:17,965 --> 03:15:21,259
I know you drink on the quiet,
and I know how much you drink.

2582
03:15:21,469 --> 03:15:24,345
Do you think I care
if you like your brandy?

2583
03:15:30,936 --> 03:15:33,813
- You're drunk and I'm going to bed.
- I'm very drunk...

2584
03:15:34,064 --> 03:15:37,776
...and I intend getting still drunker
before the evening's over.

2585
03:15:38,027 --> 03:15:39,861
But you're not going to bed.

2586
03:15:40,112 --> 03:15:41,696
Not yet.

2587
03:15:41,989 --> 03:15:43,364
Sit down.

2588
03:15:46,368 --> 03:15:49,204
So she stood by you, did she?

2589
03:15:49,497 --> 03:15:53,458
How's it feel to have the woman
you've wronged cloak your sins?

2590
03:15:54,835 --> 03:15:57,796
You're wondering if she knows
all about you and Ashley.

2591
03:15:58,047 --> 03:16:01,049
You're wondering if she did it
just to save face.

2592
03:16:01,217 --> 03:16:04,843
You're thinking she's a fool for doing it,
even if it saved your hide...

2593
03:16:05,094 --> 03:16:07,721
- I will not listen.
- Yes, you'll listen.

2594
03:16:08,223 --> 03:16:11,308
Miss Melly's a fool,
but not the kind you think.

2595
03:16:11,559 --> 03:16:16,688
She has too much honor to conceive
of dishonor in anyone she loves.

2596
03:16:16,981 --> 03:16:19,024
And she loves you.

2597
03:16:19,234 --> 03:16:22,236
Though just why she does,
I'm sure I don't know.

2598
03:16:23,238 --> 03:16:26,740
If you weren't so drunk and insulting,
I could explain everything.

2599
03:16:27,033 --> 03:16:30,494
- As it is, though...
- You get out of that chair once more...

2600
03:16:34,249 --> 03:16:39,419
Of course, the comic figure in all this
is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.

2601
03:16:39,921 --> 03:16:43,423
Mr. Wilkes, who can't be
mentally faithful to his wife...

2602
03:16:43,633 --> 03:16:46,552
...and won't be unfaithful to her
technically.

2603
03:16:47,428 --> 03:16:50,722
- Why doesn't he make up his mind?
- Rhett, you...

2604
03:16:53,726 --> 03:16:56,436
Observe my hands, my dear.

2605
03:16:57,146 --> 03:16:59,898
I could tear you to pieces with them.

2606
03:17:00,275 --> 03:17:04,361
And I'd do it if it'd take
Ashley out of your mind forever.

2607
03:17:04,904 --> 03:17:06,363
But it wouldn't.

2608
03:17:07,240 --> 03:17:11,660
So I'll remove him
from your mind forever, this way.

2609
03:17:12,287 --> 03:17:14,705
I'll put my hands so.

2610
03:17:15,123 --> 03:17:18,041
One on each side of your head.

2611
03:17:18,293 --> 03:17:22,880
And I'll smash your skull
between them like a walnut.

2612
03:17:23,131 --> 03:17:25,299
And that'll block him out.

2613
03:17:26,676 --> 03:17:29,928
Take your hands off me,
you drunken fool!

2614
03:17:34,726 --> 03:17:38,270
You know, I've always admired
your spirit, my dear.

2615
03:17:38,813 --> 03:17:41,648
Never more than now,
when you're cornered.

2616
03:17:42,317 --> 03:17:43,484
I'm not cornered.

2617
03:17:43,736 --> 03:17:46,404
You'll never corner me or frighten me.

2618
03:17:46,655 --> 03:17:49,991
You've lived in dirt so long,
you can't understand anything else.

2619
03:17:50,242 --> 03:17:53,286
You're jealous of something
you can't understand.

2620
03:17:53,495 --> 03:17:54,746
Good night.

2621
03:17:56,498 --> 03:17:57,832
Jealous, am I?

2622
03:17:58,083 --> 03:18:00,251
Yes, I suppose I am.

2623
03:18:00,502 --> 03:18:03,838
Even though I know you've been
faithful to me all along.

2624
03:18:04,089 --> 03:18:05,214
How do I know?

2625
03:18:05,466 --> 03:18:08,927
Because I know Ashley Wilkes
and his honorable breed.

2626
03:18:09,136 --> 03:18:10,803
They're gentlemen.

2627
03:18:11,013 --> 03:18:14,349
That's more than I can say
for you or for me.

2628
03:18:14,642 --> 03:18:18,811
We're not gentlemen.
And we have no honor, have we?

2629
03:18:27,780 --> 03:18:29,989
It's not that easy, Scarlett.

2630
03:18:34,119 --> 03:18:38,039
You turn me out while you chase Ashley,
while you dream of Ashley.

2631
03:18:38,290 --> 03:18:41,042
This is one night
you're not turning me out.

2632
03:19:08,778 --> 03:19:10,779
How are you feeling this morning?

2633
03:19:11,030 --> 03:19:13,782
Well, this misery in my back...

2634
03:19:13,992 --> 03:19:15,659
...ain't so good.

2635
03:19:17,996 --> 03:19:20,288
You act mighty happy this morning.

2636
03:19:20,540 --> 03:19:22,749
I am, Mammy. I am.

2637
03:19:29,090 --> 03:19:34,219
Oh, she wept with delight
When he gave her a smile

2638
03:19:34,512 --> 03:19:39,391
And trembled with fear at his frown

2639
03:19:55,950 --> 03:19:57,367
Hello.

2640
03:19:58,327 --> 03:19:59,703
I, um...

2641
03:19:59,871 --> 03:20:03,123
I'd like to extend my apology
for my conduct of last night.

2642
03:20:03,708 --> 03:20:04,875
Oh, but, Rhett.

2643
03:20:05,376 --> 03:20:07,461
I was very drunk...

2644
03:20:07,795 --> 03:20:10,380
...and quite swept off my feet
by your charms.

2645
03:20:12,550 --> 03:20:15,886
You needn't bother to apologize.
Nothing you do surprises me.

2646
03:20:16,429 --> 03:20:20,640
I've been thinking, and I believe
it would be better for both of us...

2647
03:20:20,892 --> 03:20:23,643
...if we admitted we made a mistake
and got a divorce.

2648
03:20:23,936 --> 03:20:25,312
- A divorce?
- Yes.

2649
03:20:25,563 --> 03:20:27,981
There's no point in holding on
to each other.

2650
03:20:28,274 --> 03:20:30,609
I'll provide for you.
You've plenty of grounds.

2651
03:20:30,860 --> 03:20:33,487
Just give me Bonnie,
and you can say what you please.

2652
03:20:33,738 --> 03:20:37,991
Thank you, but I wouldn't dream of
disgracing the family with a divorce.

2653
03:20:38,659 --> 03:20:41,078
You'd disgrace it
if Ashley were free.

2654
03:20:41,329 --> 03:20:44,623
Makes my head spin to think
how quickly you'd divorce me.

2655
03:20:45,083 --> 03:20:46,124
Wouldn't you?

2656
03:20:48,169 --> 03:20:49,920
Answer me. Wouldn't you?

2657
03:20:50,588 --> 03:20:52,506
Please go now and leave me alone.

2658
03:20:54,342 --> 03:20:56,510
I'm going. That's what I came
to tell you.

2659
03:20:57,637 --> 03:21:00,013
I'm going on a very extended trip
to London.

2660
03:21:00,306 --> 03:21:02,015
- And I'm leaving today.
- Oh.

2661
03:21:02,391 --> 03:21:06,436
I'm taking Bonnie with me.
Please get her duds packed right away.

2662
03:21:06,687 --> 03:21:09,106
You'll never take my child
out of this house.

2663
03:21:09,315 --> 03:21:13,110
She's my child too. You're mistaken
if you think I'm leaving her here...

2664
03:21:13,361 --> 03:21:15,987
...with a mother who doesn't
consider her reputation.

2665
03:21:16,197 --> 03:21:17,906
You're a fine one to talk.

2666
03:21:18,116 --> 03:21:22,536
You think I'll let her out when you'll
have her around people like Belle?

2667
03:21:23,454 --> 03:21:25,997
If you were a man,
I'd break your neck for that.

2668
03:21:26,207 --> 03:21:28,208
I'll thank you to shut your mouth.

2669
03:21:28,459 --> 03:21:31,128
As for you giving yourself airs
about motherhood...

2670
03:21:31,379 --> 03:21:33,421
...a cat's a better mother
than you are.

2671
03:21:33,673 --> 03:21:36,550
Have her things packed for me
in an hour, or I warn you...

2672
03:21:36,801 --> 03:21:40,554
...I've always thought a lashing with
a whip would benefit you immensely.

2673
03:21:46,144 --> 03:21:47,435
Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.

2674
03:21:48,396 --> 03:21:50,730
- Hello, Uncle Rhett.
- Hello, Beau.

2675
03:21:50,982 --> 03:21:56,027
Daddy, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all morning.

2676
03:21:56,237 --> 03:21:59,906
I've been hunting for a rabbit skin
to wrap my little Bonnie in.

2677
03:22:00,158 --> 03:22:02,075
Give your best sweetheart a kiss.

2678
03:22:04,203 --> 03:22:08,999
Bonnie, I'm going to take you
on a long trip to fairyland.

2679
03:22:09,417 --> 03:22:11,168
Where? Where?

2680
03:22:11,419 --> 03:22:14,753
I'll show you the Tower of London,
where the little princes were...

2681
03:22:15,046 --> 03:22:16,881
...and London Bridge.

2682
03:22:17,090 --> 03:22:20,718
London Bridge?
Will it be falling down?

2683
03:22:21,845 --> 03:22:24,471
Well, it will
if you want it to, darling.

2684
03:22:26,767 --> 03:22:30,020
Daddy, dark!

2685
03:22:30,271 --> 03:22:31,771
Dark!

2686
03:22:32,190 --> 03:22:34,232
Bonnie! Bonnie!

2687
03:22:35,026 --> 03:22:38,361
It's all right, Bonnie.
Who put out that light? Nurse!

2688
03:22:40,531 --> 03:22:43,617
Daddy, dark!
Yes, yes, yes...

2689
03:22:43,868 --> 03:22:45,785
What's the matter with my Bonnie?

2690
03:22:46,037 --> 03:22:47,579
A bear!

2691
03:22:47,788 --> 03:22:50,081
Oh, a bear? A big bear?

2692
03:22:50,291 --> 03:22:51,625
Dreadful big!

2693
03:22:51,792 --> 03:22:53,919
And he sat on my chest!

2694
03:22:54,128 --> 03:22:57,547
I'll stay here and shoot him
if he comes back.

2695
03:23:11,812 --> 03:23:14,022
Oh, good evening, Mr. Butler.

2696
03:23:16,651 --> 03:23:19,444
I told you never to leave
this child alone in the dark.

2697
03:23:19,654 --> 03:23:23,281
Children are often afraid of the dark,
but they get over it.

2698
03:23:23,491 --> 03:23:25,116
Let her scream for a night...

2699
03:23:25,326 --> 03:23:26,534
Let her scream?

2700
03:23:26,744 --> 03:23:29,079
Either you're a fool
or an inhuman woman.

2701
03:23:29,330 --> 03:23:31,790
If you want her to grow up cowardly...

2702
03:23:32,041 --> 03:23:35,418
Cowardly? There isn't
a cowardly bone in her body.

2703
03:23:35,670 --> 03:23:37,295
You're discharged.

2704
03:23:37,546 --> 03:23:39,256
As you say, sir.

2705
03:23:55,690 --> 03:23:57,190
Where's Mother?

2706
03:24:00,027 --> 03:24:01,194
Bonnie...

2707
03:24:03,781 --> 03:24:05,782
Aren't you happy here
in London with me?

2708
03:24:06,534 --> 03:24:09,577
I wanna go home.

2709
03:24:21,215 --> 03:24:25,719
Miss Bonnie! And Captain Butler!
Miss Scarlett!

2710
03:24:25,886 --> 03:24:26,970
Hello, Mammy!

2711
03:24:27,221 --> 03:24:29,014
Honey child!

2712
03:24:29,890 --> 03:24:34,728
Miss Scarlett, they's back.
They's back!

2713
03:24:34,895 --> 03:24:36,980
Bonnie! Bonnie, baby.

2714
03:24:37,231 --> 03:24:39,733
Darling baby!
You glad to be home?

2715
03:24:40,026 --> 03:24:41,901
Daddy gave me a kitten.

2716
03:24:42,153 --> 03:24:46,072
But London's a horrid place.

2717
03:24:46,240 --> 03:24:49,409
Where's my pony?
I wanna go out and see my pony.

2718
03:24:49,660 --> 03:24:51,870
You go out and see your pony.

2719
03:25:00,588 --> 03:25:02,589
Where's my pony?

2720
03:25:03,257 --> 03:25:05,216
I want to go out and see my pony.

2721
03:25:05,760 --> 03:25:07,427
You run along with Mammy.

2722
03:25:07,678 --> 03:25:12,182
Come on, honey child.
Mammy sure missed you, honey.

2723
03:25:13,267 --> 03:25:15,518
Mrs. Butler, I believe.

2724
03:25:15,895 --> 03:25:18,228
Mammy said you'd come back.

2725
03:25:18,563 --> 03:25:19,855
Only to bring Bonnie.

2726
03:25:20,273 --> 03:25:24,276
Apparently any mother,
even a bad one, is better than none.

2727
03:25:24,444 --> 03:25:26,070
You mean you're going away again?

2728
03:25:26,654 --> 03:25:29,281
What perception, Mrs. Butler.
Right away.

2729
03:25:29,783 --> 03:25:32,868
- In fact, I left my bags at the station.
- Oh.

2730
03:25:33,953 --> 03:25:37,039
You're looking pale.
Is there a shortage of rouge?

2731
03:25:37,290 --> 03:25:40,376
Or can this wanness mean
you've been missing me?

2732
03:25:40,627 --> 03:25:42,044
If I'm pale, it's your fault.

2733
03:25:42,295 --> 03:25:45,547
Not because I've been
missing you, but because...

2734
03:25:49,052 --> 03:25:51,387
Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.

2735
03:25:51,888 --> 03:25:54,640
It's because I'm going to have a baby.

2736
03:26:00,105 --> 03:26:03,273
Indeed. And who's the happy father?

2737
03:26:04,150 --> 03:26:07,319
You know it's yours.
I don't want it any more than you do.

2738
03:26:07,612 --> 03:26:10,322
No woman would want the child
of a cad like you.

2739
03:26:10,573 --> 03:26:13,283
I wish it were anybody's
child but yours!

2740
03:26:14,494 --> 03:26:17,454
Well, cheer up.
Maybe you'll have an accident.

2741
03:26:31,636 --> 03:26:33,303
Is she better?

2742
03:26:37,225 --> 03:26:38,434
Has she asked for me?

2743
03:26:38,685 --> 03:26:41,645
Don't you understand?
She's delirious.

2744
03:26:42,480 --> 03:26:45,107
Rhett...

2745
03:26:45,358 --> 03:26:47,317
I want Rhett!

2746
03:26:51,239 --> 03:26:54,533
What's the matter, honey?
Did you call somebody, child?

2747
03:26:54,826 --> 03:26:59,371
It's no use. It's no use!

2748
03:27:20,853 --> 03:27:22,896
Dr. Meade's left.

2749
03:27:23,397 --> 03:27:26,900
- Scarlett's dead.
- Oh, no, she's much better.

2750
03:27:27,067 --> 03:27:28,985
Really she is.

2751
03:27:45,294 --> 03:27:48,171
There, there, Captain Butler,
you're beside yourself.

2752
03:27:48,380 --> 03:27:51,341
She'll very soon be well again.
I promise you.

2753
03:27:51,550 --> 03:27:53,593
She never wanted this baby.

2754
03:27:53,844 --> 03:27:56,513
Not want a baby?
Why, every woman wants a baby.

2755
03:27:56,722 --> 03:27:59,432
You do, but she doesn't.
Not my children.

2756
03:27:59,600 --> 03:28:01,601
She told me she didn't want any more.

2757
03:28:01,810 --> 03:28:05,104
I wanted to hurt her because
she'd hurt me. And I did.

2758
03:28:05,356 --> 03:28:08,441
You mustn't tell me these things.
It's not fair to...

2759
03:28:08,692 --> 03:28:11,361
I didn't know about this baby
until she fell.

2760
03:28:11,612 --> 03:28:14,322
If I'd only known,
I'd have come straight home.

2761
03:28:14,532 --> 03:28:16,449
Well, of course you would.

2762
03:28:16,700 --> 03:28:20,119
And then when she told me
there on the steps, what did I do?

2763
03:28:20,454 --> 03:28:22,955
What did I say?
I laughed and I said...

2764
03:28:23,206 --> 03:28:26,124
But you didn't mean it.
I know you didn't mean it.

2765
03:28:26,334 --> 03:28:29,253
But I did mean it.
I was crazy with jealousy.

2766
03:28:29,462 --> 03:28:33,423
She's never cared for me. I tried
to make her care, but I couldn't.

2767
03:28:34,968 --> 03:28:36,301
You're so wrong.

2768
03:28:36,469 --> 03:28:40,931
Scarlett loves you a great deal.
Much more than she knows.

2769
03:28:41,474 --> 03:28:45,477
If that were true, I'd wait forever.
If she'd only forgive me.

2770
03:28:45,645 --> 03:28:49,648
She will. You must be patient.

2771
03:28:51,109 --> 03:28:56,238
No, it's not possible. If you
only knew who she really loved...

2772
03:28:57,365 --> 03:28:59,074
You wouldn't believe it.

2773
03:29:01,995 --> 03:29:04,413
Surely you haven't
listened to idle gossip.

2774
03:29:04,664 --> 03:29:08,250
No, Captain Butler.
I wouldn't believe it.

2775
03:29:09,168 --> 03:29:13,880
There, there. Scarlett's going to get well,
and there can be other babies.

2776
03:29:14,757 --> 03:29:17,426
She couldn't even if she wanted to.

2777
03:29:17,677 --> 03:29:21,305
But of course she could!
I'm going to.

2778
03:29:24,601 --> 03:29:27,894
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.
It's too dangerous.

2779
03:29:28,146 --> 03:29:31,106
Children are life renewing itself,
Captain Butler.

2780
03:29:31,357 --> 03:29:36,194
And when life does that,
danger seems very unimportant.

2781
03:29:37,947 --> 03:29:41,617
I've never before known anyone
who was really brave.

2782
03:29:41,868 --> 03:29:44,786
I pray God things go well
with you, Miss Melly.

2783
03:29:45,038 --> 03:29:49,333
And I want to thank you for all
you've done for me and for Scarlett.

2784
03:29:50,043 --> 03:29:52,210
From my heart, I thank you.

2785
03:29:58,676 --> 03:30:02,012
Miss Scarlett's feeling
a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.

2786
03:30:02,221 --> 03:30:03,722
Thank you, Mammy.

2787
03:30:10,813 --> 03:30:12,898
I've come to ask your forgiveness...

2788
03:30:13,066 --> 03:30:15,734
...hoping our life together
has another chance.

2789
03:30:15,985 --> 03:30:19,988
Our life together? When did we
ever have a life together?

2790
03:30:21,240 --> 03:30:23,033
Yes, you're right.

2791
03:30:23,242 --> 03:30:27,079
But I'm sure if we could only
try again, we could be happy.

2792
03:30:27,372 --> 03:30:29,247
What is there
to make us happy now?

2793
03:30:30,583 --> 03:30:33,543
Well, there's Bonnie...

2794
03:30:33,961 --> 03:30:35,754
...and I love you, Scarlett.

2795
03:30:36,089 --> 03:30:37,756
When did you discover that?

2796
03:30:38,007 --> 03:30:42,094
I've always loved you, but you've
never given me a chance to show it.

2797
03:30:43,971 --> 03:30:46,264
And just what do you want me to do?

2798
03:30:47,350 --> 03:30:51,269
To begin with, give up the mill,
Scarlett. We'll go away.

2799
03:30:51,521 --> 03:30:53,605
We'll take Bonnie
and have another honeymoon.

2800
03:30:53,856 --> 03:30:56,525
Give up the mill?
It's making more money than ever.

2801
03:30:56,776 --> 03:30:59,277
I know, but we don't need it.
Sell it.

2802
03:30:59,779 --> 03:31:03,281
Or give it to Ashley.
Melanie's been such a friend to us.

2803
03:31:03,533 --> 03:31:06,076
Melanie!
If you'd only think more about me!

2804
03:31:06,369 --> 03:31:08,286
I am thinking of you.

2805
03:31:08,871 --> 03:31:11,581
And I'm thinking that, well...

2806
03:31:12,125 --> 03:31:15,210
...maybe the mill's taking you
away from me and Bonnie.

2807
03:31:15,962 --> 03:31:18,588
I know what you're thinking.
Don't bring Bonnie into it.

2808
03:31:18,798 --> 03:31:21,550
- You're taking her away from me.
- But she loves you.

2809
03:31:21,801 --> 03:31:25,470
You've made her love you and not me.
She's so spoiled now, that...

2810
03:31:25,638 --> 03:31:28,639
Mommy, Daddy! Watch me.

2811
03:31:28,807 --> 03:31:30,307
We're watching, darling.

2812
03:31:30,726 --> 03:31:32,393
You're mighty pretty, precious.

2813
03:31:32,644 --> 03:31:34,145
So are you.

2814
03:31:34,396 --> 03:31:37,314
I'm going to jump.
Watch me, Daddy.

2815
03:31:37,566 --> 03:31:40,276
I don't think you ought
to do much jumping yet.

2816
03:31:40,485 --> 03:31:42,528
You just learned
to ride sidesaddle.

2817
03:31:42,988 --> 03:31:44,238
I will so jump.

2818
03:31:44,448 --> 03:31:47,158
I can jump better than ever,
because I've grown.

2819
03:31:47,451 --> 03:31:48,826
I moved the bar higher.

2820
03:31:49,077 --> 03:31:50,619
Don't let her do it, Rhett.

2821
03:31:50,829 --> 03:31:52,581
No, Bonnie, you can't.

2822
03:31:52,790 --> 03:31:54,916
If you fall off,
don't cry and blame me!

2823
03:31:55,918 --> 03:31:58,837
Rhett, stop her.

2824
03:31:59,464 --> 03:32:02,340
Bonnie!

2825
03:32:03,676 --> 03:32:05,677
She's just like Pa.

2826
03:32:08,681 --> 03:32:10,682
Just like Pa...!

2827
03:32:11,517 --> 03:32:13,518
Bonnie! Bonnie!

2828
03:32:21,194 --> 03:32:24,362
Bonnie!

2829
03:32:41,005 --> 03:32:44,674
Lordy, Miss Melly.
I sure is glad you's come.

2830
03:32:44,842 --> 03:32:49,304
Oh, Mammy, this house won't seem
the same without Bonnie.

2831
03:32:49,555 --> 03:32:51,473
How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?

2832
03:32:51,724 --> 03:32:54,810
Miss Melly, this here's
done broke her heart.

2833
03:32:55,061 --> 03:32:57,395
I didn't fetch you
on Miss Scarlett's account.

2834
03:32:57,688 --> 03:33:02,818
What that child got to stand, the good
Lord give her strength to stand.

2835
03:33:03,319 --> 03:33:06,154
It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.

2836
03:33:09,158 --> 03:33:11,827
He done lost his mind
these last couple of days.

2837
03:33:12,078 --> 03:33:13,495
Oh, no, Mammy, no.

2838
03:33:13,746 --> 03:33:18,250
I ain't never seen no man, black or white,
set such store on any child.

2839
03:33:18,501 --> 03:33:20,752
When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...

2840
03:33:21,003 --> 03:33:25,382
...Mr. Rhett grabbed his gun and run
out and shoot that poor pony.

2841
03:33:25,633 --> 03:33:28,885
And for a minute,
I think he gonna shoot hisself.

2842
03:33:29,136 --> 03:33:30,679
Oh, poor Captain Butler.

2843
03:33:30,930 --> 03:33:35,559
Miss Scarlett called him a murderer
for teaching that child to jump.

2844
03:33:35,768 --> 03:33:38,603
She said, "You give me my baby
what you killed. "

2845
03:33:38,855 --> 03:33:42,941
And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't
never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.

2846
03:33:43,234 --> 03:33:47,070
It like to turn my blood cold,
the things they say to one another.

2847
03:33:47,280 --> 03:33:50,156
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.

2848
03:33:52,702 --> 03:33:54,536
And then that night...

2849
03:33:55,621 --> 03:33:59,291
...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself
in the nursery with Miss Bonnie.

2850
03:34:00,418 --> 03:34:03,795
He wouldn't open the door when
Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered.

2851
03:34:04,088 --> 03:34:06,256
And that's where he's been
for two whole days.

2852
03:34:06,424 --> 03:34:08,466
Oh, Mammy!

2853
03:34:08,801 --> 03:34:12,470
This evening, Miss Scarlett shouted
through the door and said:

2854
03:34:12,763 --> 03:34:14,472
"The funeral's set for tomorrow. "

2855
03:34:14,724 --> 03:34:17,392
He says, "You try that,
and I kills you tomorrow.

2856
03:34:17,768 --> 03:34:22,772
Do you think I's gonna put my child
in the dark when she's so scared of it?"

2857
03:34:22,940 --> 03:34:24,149
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!

2858
03:34:24,317 --> 03:34:27,485
- He has lost his mind!
- Yes'm, that's the God's truth.

2859
03:34:27,737 --> 03:34:31,655
He ain't gonna let us bury
that child. You gotta help us.

2860
03:34:31,823 --> 03:34:33,324
Oh, but I can't intrude.

2861
03:34:33,617 --> 03:34:35,409
If you can't help us, who can?

2862
03:34:35,660 --> 03:34:39,163
Mr. Rhett always set great store
by your opinion.

2863
03:34:40,916 --> 03:34:42,917
Please, Miss Melly.

2864
03:34:43,793 --> 03:34:46,837
I'll do what I can, Mammy.

2865
03:34:52,719 --> 03:34:54,845
Get away from that door
and leave us alone.

2866
03:34:55,096 --> 03:34:57,097
It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.

2867
03:34:57,349 --> 03:35:01,018
Please let me in.
I've come to see Bonnie.

2868
03:35:22,040 --> 03:35:26,794
Oh, Lord, please help Mr. Rhett
in this hour of his grief.

2869
03:35:36,721 --> 03:35:38,055
Mammy...

2870
03:35:38,807 --> 03:35:41,892
I want you to make a good deal
of strong coffee...

2871
03:35:42,143 --> 03:35:45,729
...and bring it up to Captain Butler.
I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.

2872
03:35:45,897 --> 03:35:47,231
But...

2873
03:35:47,399 --> 03:35:51,902
Captain Butler's willing for the funeral
to take place tomorrow morning.

2874
03:35:52,195 --> 03:35:56,907
Hallelujah! I expect the angels
fights on your side, Miss Melly.

2875
03:35:58,201 --> 03:36:01,495
Miss Melly! Miss Melly! Miss Melly!

2876
03:36:01,913 --> 03:36:04,206
Miss Melly. Miss Melly.

2877
03:36:05,083 --> 03:36:09,086
Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy.
And try...

2878
03:36:09,337 --> 03:36:11,338
Try to get me home.

2879
03:36:12,424 --> 03:36:14,383
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!

2880
03:36:21,850 --> 03:36:24,059
Where is my mother going away to?

2881
03:36:24,310 --> 03:36:27,604
And why can't I go along, please?

2882
03:36:27,814 --> 03:36:32,192
We can't always go along, Beau,
as much as we may want to.

2883
03:36:32,861 --> 03:36:34,946
You're going back to bed now.

2884
03:36:35,823 --> 03:36:39,325
Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying.
She can't be.

2885
03:36:39,577 --> 03:36:42,412
She hasn't your strength.
She's never had any.

2886
03:36:42,621 --> 03:36:46,124
- She's never had anything but heart.
- You knew that too?

2887
03:36:46,417 --> 03:36:49,335
Why do I have to go back to bed?
It's morning.

2888
03:36:49,962 --> 03:36:51,629
It isn't really morning yet.

2889
03:36:58,220 --> 03:36:59,763
You may come in now, Scarlett.

2890
03:36:59,972 --> 03:37:03,725
Dr. Meade, please let me see her.
I've been waiting here two days.

2891
03:37:03,976 --> 03:37:06,978
I've got to tell her
that I was wrong about something.

2892
03:37:07,229 --> 03:37:10,774
She knows you were wrong.
She wants to see Scarlett.

2893
03:37:13,903 --> 03:37:17,155
Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
Don't ease your conscience...

2894
03:37:17,406 --> 03:37:21,618
...telling her things that make
no difference now. You understand?

2895
03:37:35,799 --> 03:37:37,674
It's me, Melly.

2896
03:37:38,885 --> 03:37:40,677
Promise me?

2897
03:37:40,970 --> 03:37:42,471
Anything.

2898
03:37:43,181 --> 03:37:45,682
Look after my little son.

2899
03:37:46,518 --> 03:37:50,979
I gave him to you once before.
Remember?

2900
03:37:52,107 --> 03:37:53,774
The day he was born.

2901
03:37:54,025 --> 03:37:58,028
Please, Melly, don't talk this way.
I know you'll get well.

2902
03:37:58,279 --> 03:38:01,031
Promise me... college.

2903
03:38:01,199 --> 03:38:05,410
Yes, and Europe, and a pony.
Whatever he wants, but...

2904
03:38:06,621 --> 03:38:08,038
...oh, Melly, do try.

2905
03:38:08,289 --> 03:38:10,207
Ashley...

2906
03:38:11,209 --> 03:38:12,918
Ashley and you...

2907
03:38:15,213 --> 03:38:18,423
What about Ashley, Melly?

2908
03:38:19,217 --> 03:38:22,177
Look after him for me...

2909
03:38:22,387 --> 03:38:26,348
...just as you looked after me...

2910
03:38:27,559 --> 03:38:28,725
...for him.

2911
03:38:30,645 --> 03:38:32,312
I will, Melly.

2912
03:38:33,189 --> 03:38:35,232
Look after him...

2913
03:38:35,692 --> 03:38:39,570
...but never let him know.

2914
03:38:48,663 --> 03:38:50,455
Good night.

2915
03:38:51,583 --> 03:38:54,042
Promise?

2916
03:38:54,252 --> 03:38:56,336
What else, Melly?

2917
03:38:56,588 --> 03:38:58,755
Captain Butler.

2918
03:38:59,757 --> 03:39:03,260
- Be kind to him.
- Rhett?

2919
03:39:03,887 --> 03:39:06,930
He loves you so.

2920
03:39:10,018 --> 03:39:11,935
Yes, Melly.

2921
03:39:14,022 --> 03:39:17,983
Goodbye.

2922
03:39:33,917 --> 03:39:36,126
You ladies may come in now.

2923
03:39:38,630 --> 03:39:39,922
Rhett...

2924
03:39:41,507 --> 03:39:42,799
Ashley!

2925
03:39:43,635 --> 03:39:46,970
I don't know where
the mate to this is.

2926
03:39:47,138 --> 03:39:49,640
She must've put it away.

2927
03:39:50,600 --> 03:39:55,145
Stop it! Hold me. I'm so frightened!

2928
03:39:56,814 --> 03:39:59,274
I'm so frightened!

2929
03:40:03,529 --> 03:40:07,824
Scarlett, what can I do?
I can't live without her. I can't!

2930
03:40:08,910 --> 03:40:13,038
Everything I ever had
is going with her.

2931
03:40:13,581 --> 03:40:15,165
Oh, Ashley...

2932
03:40:16,251 --> 03:40:18,835
You really love her, don't you?

2933
03:40:19,087 --> 03:40:24,174
She's the only dream I ever had
that didn't die in the face of reality.

2934
03:40:24,592 --> 03:40:27,844
Dreams. Always dreams with you.
Never common sense.

2935
03:40:28,137 --> 03:40:31,348
Scarlett, if you knew what
I've gone through!

2936
03:40:32,016 --> 03:40:36,019
Ashley, you should've told me years
ago that you loved her and not me.

2937
03:40:36,271 --> 03:40:39,314
And not left me dangling
with your talk of honor.

2938
03:40:39,523 --> 03:40:43,276
But you had to wait till now,
now when Melly's dying...

2939
03:40:43,485 --> 03:40:46,821
...to show me that I could never
mean any more to you...

2940
03:40:47,072 --> 03:40:49,532
...than this Watling woman
does to Rhett.

2941
03:40:51,493 --> 03:40:56,372
And I've loved something
that doesn't really exist.

2942
03:40:58,583 --> 03:41:00,167
But somehow...

2943
03:41:01,211 --> 03:41:02,878
...I don't care.

2944
03:41:04,131 --> 03:41:06,215
Somehow, it doesn't matter.

2945
03:41:07,968 --> 03:41:10,386
It doesn't matter one bit.

2946
03:41:13,098 --> 03:41:14,390
Oh, Ashley...

2947
03:41:14,641 --> 03:41:16,475
Ashley, forgive me.

2948
03:41:16,727 --> 03:41:20,230
Don't cry. She mustn't see
you've been crying.

2949
03:41:20,481 --> 03:41:21,606
Ashley!

2950
03:41:24,986 --> 03:41:26,236
Melly!

2951
03:41:28,197 --> 03:41:29,614
Melly!

2952
03:41:34,037 --> 03:41:36,580
Rhett! Rhett!

2953
03:41:39,417 --> 03:41:41,251
Rhett, where are you?

2954
03:41:45,214 --> 03:41:53,764
Rhett, wait for me!

2955
03:41:56,059 --> 03:42:21,666
Rhett!

2956
03:42:24,879 --> 03:42:26,296
Come in.

2957
03:42:33,971 --> 03:42:35,305
Rhett...

2958
03:42:35,681 --> 03:42:38,183
Melanie, she's...?

2959
03:42:40,978 --> 03:42:42,562
Well, God rest her.

2960
03:42:42,980 --> 03:42:46,316
She was the only completely
kind person I ever knew.

2961
03:42:46,776 --> 03:42:50,487
A great lady. A very great lady.

2962
03:42:52,824 --> 03:42:56,743
So she's dead. That makes it
nice for you, doesn't it?

2963
03:42:56,994 --> 03:43:01,748
How can you say such a thing?
You know how I loved her, really.

2964
03:43:01,999 --> 03:43:04,084
No, I don't know that I do.

2965
03:43:04,335 --> 03:43:07,003
It's to your credit that
you could appreciate her.

2966
03:43:07,255 --> 03:43:11,758
Of course I appreciated her.
She thought of everybody except herself.

2967
03:43:11,968 --> 03:43:16,179
- Why, her last words were about you.
- What did she say?

2968
03:43:16,431 --> 03:43:19,724
She said, "Be kind to Captain Butler...

2969
03:43:19,976 --> 03:43:21,977
...he loves you so. "

2970
03:43:26,816 --> 03:43:29,693
Did she say anything else?
She said...

2971
03:43:30,111 --> 03:43:33,447
She asked me to look after Ashley too.

2972
03:43:34,782 --> 03:43:38,243
It's convenient to have
the first wife's permission, isn't it?

2973
03:43:40,329 --> 03:43:41,997
What do you mean?

2974
03:43:44,374 --> 03:43:46,000
What are you doing?

2975
03:43:46,209 --> 03:43:47,835
I'm leaving you, my dear.

2976
03:43:48,044 --> 03:43:53,048
All you need now is a divorce,
and your dreams of Ashley can come true.

2977
03:43:55,010 --> 03:43:57,052
Oh, no!

2978
03:43:57,304 --> 03:43:59,555
No, you're wrong. Terribly wrong.

2979
03:43:59,848 --> 03:44:01,015
I don't want a divorce.

2980
03:44:01,266 --> 03:44:04,310
Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight,
when I knew I loved you...

2981
03:44:04,561 --> 03:44:07,396
...I ran home to tell you.
Oh, darling, darling!

2982
03:44:07,689 --> 03:44:09,064
Please don't go on with this.

2983
03:44:09,316 --> 03:44:12,985
Leave us some dignity out
of our marriage. Spare us this last.

2984
03:44:13,236 --> 03:44:17,781
This last? Do listen to me! I must
have loved you for years, only...

2985
03:44:18,033 --> 03:44:19,909
...I was such a fool,
I didn't know it.

2986
03:44:20,202 --> 03:44:24,747
Please believe me. You must care.
Melly said you did.

2987
03:44:24,998 --> 03:44:28,167
I believe you.
And what about Ashley Wilkes?

2988
03:44:28,752 --> 03:44:31,212
I never really loved Ashley.

2989
03:44:31,421 --> 03:44:34,924
You certainly gave a good imitation
of it, up to this morning.

2990
03:44:36,051 --> 03:44:38,511
No, Scarlett. I've tried everything.

2991
03:44:38,720 --> 03:44:41,680
If you'd met me halfway, even
when I came back from London.

2992
03:44:41,932 --> 03:44:45,434
I was so glad to see you.
I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.

2993
03:44:45,685 --> 03:44:48,562
Then when you were sick,
and it was all my fault.

2994
03:44:48,813 --> 03:44:51,440
I hoped that you'd call for me.
But you didn't.

2995
03:44:51,733 --> 03:44:54,693
I wanted you. I wanted you
desperately...

2996
03:44:54,903 --> 03:44:57,112
...but I didn't think you wanted me.

2997
03:44:57,364 --> 03:45:00,199
It seems we've been
at cross purposes, doesn't it?

2998
03:45:00,450 --> 03:45:02,284
But it's no use now.

2999
03:45:02,536 --> 03:45:05,955
As long as there was Bonnie,
there was a chance we might be happy.

3000
03:45:06,206 --> 03:45:09,291
I liked to think that Bonnie
was you, a little girl again.

3001
03:45:09,543 --> 03:45:12,294
Before the war and poverty
had done things to you.

3002
03:45:12,546 --> 03:45:14,213
She was so like you.

3003
03:45:14,422 --> 03:45:17,633
And I could pet her and spoil her,
as I wanted to spoil you.

3004
03:45:19,344 --> 03:45:22,096
But when she went, she took everything.

3005
03:45:23,223 --> 03:45:26,392
Rhett, please don't say that.
I'm so sorry.

3006
03:45:26,643 --> 03:45:29,395
I'm so sorry for everything.

3007
03:45:30,063 --> 03:45:32,314
My darling, you're such a child.

3008
03:45:32,566 --> 03:45:37,486
You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"
all the past can be corrected.

3009
03:45:39,281 --> 03:45:41,657
Here, take my handkerchief.

3010
03:45:41,908 --> 03:45:46,287
Never, in any crisis of your life, have
I known you to have a handkerchief.

3011
03:45:50,417 --> 03:45:52,960
Rhett! Rhett, where are you going?

3012
03:45:53,169 --> 03:45:55,671
I'm going to Charleston,
back where I belong.

3013
03:45:55,964 --> 03:45:58,173
Please. Please take me with you.

3014
03:45:58,383 --> 03:46:01,261
No. I'm through
with everything here.

3015
03:46:01,804 --> 03:46:04,180
I want peace.
I want to see if somewhere...

3016
03:46:04,473 --> 03:46:08,184
...there isn't something left
in life of charm and grace.

3017
03:46:08,436 --> 03:46:10,186
- You know what I'm talking about?
- No!

3018
03:46:10,438 --> 03:46:14,357
- I only know that I love you!
- That's your misfortune.

3019
03:46:14,692 --> 03:46:16,318
Oh, Rhett!

3020
03:46:21,032 --> 03:46:22,449
Rhett!

3021
03:46:24,702 --> 03:46:26,119
Rhett! Rhett!

3022
03:46:28,456 --> 03:46:33,418
Rhett! If you go, where shall I go?
What shall I do?

3023
03:46:33,669 --> 03:46:36,713
Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn.

3024
03:46:49,976 --> 03:46:53,020
I can't let him go. I can't!

3025
03:46:53,313 --> 03:46:56,357
There must be some way
to bring him back.

3026
03:46:57,567 --> 03:47:02,571
Oh, I can't think about this now.
I'll go crazy if I do.

3027
03:47:03,531 --> 03:47:05,908
I'll think about it tomorrow.

3028
03:47:20,090 --> 03:47:22,883
But I must think about it!

3029
03:47:23,093 --> 03:47:25,344
I must think about it.

3030
03:47:26,054 --> 03:47:28,263
What is there to do?

3031
03:47:29,182 --> 03:47:31,600
What is there that matters?

3032
03:47:34,104 --> 03:47:38,190
You mean to tell me,
Scarlett, Tara doesn't mean anything?

3033
03:47:38,441 --> 03:47:42,861
Land's the only thing that matters.
It's the only thing that lasts.

3034
03:47:43,113 --> 03:47:46,740
Something you love more than
me, though you may not know it. Tara.

3035
03:47:46,991 --> 03:47:50,411
It's this from which you get
your strength, the red earth of Tara.

3036
03:47:50,620 --> 03:47:54,289
Land's the only thing that matters.
The only thing that lasts.

3037
03:47:54,582 --> 03:47:57,626
Something you love more
than me, though you may not know it.

3038
03:47:57,919 --> 03:48:00,295
From which you get
your strength. Tara.

3039
03:48:00,505 --> 03:48:02,423
Land's the only thing that matters.

3040
03:48:02,590 --> 03:48:03,799
Something you love more.

3041
03:48:04,050 --> 03:48:06,135
The red earth of Tara.
Tara!

3042
03:48:06,302 --> 03:48:07,803
Tara!
Tara!

3043
03:48:10,265 --> 03:48:11,807
Tara!

3044
03:48:12,809 --> 03:48:14,309
Home.

3045
03:48:15,228 --> 03:48:17,062
I'll go home.

3046
03:48:17,647 --> 03:48:20,649
And I'll think of some way
to get him back.

3047
03:48:20,900 --> 03:48:26,029
After all, tomorrow is another day!
