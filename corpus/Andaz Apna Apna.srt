1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
- You were saying something.
- Yes

2
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:08,983
- Yes?
- I was speaking from my heart...

3
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:13,273
Actually I...

4
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:18,107
- What is it?
- I...

5
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:23,733
From quite some time now...

6
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:28,691
Two minutes.

7
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:40,524
- Miss Raveena!
- Doctor!

8
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:43,858
- You were saying something.
- Yes, about my stomach...

9
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:49,525
...no!
About my heart.

10
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:54,732
- Are you okay, doctor?
- Should I call a doctor?

11
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:58,691
- He was speaking his heart.
- Heart?! Yes? What was that?

12
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:03,025
- I'll tell her later.
- Let me listen, too. Go on!

13
00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:05,232
- Let me go!
- Please speak.

14
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,232
- Let me go!
- You'll break her heart!

15
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,440
- Let it break!
- Speak up, will you?

16
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:11,774
Speak up now or it'll be too late.

17
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:17,442
- It's late, anyway!
- Go away...

18
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:22,942
- You're fine, I hope.
- Absolutely! What can happen to me?

19
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:37,357
Where did this road-block materialize from?

20
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:39,440
The name is Crime Master Gogo!

21
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:42,399
I play with eye-balls as if they were marbles.

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,357
Where's your boss, Teja?
He ran away with my money!

23
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:47,774
- We don't know!
- We don't know, I swear!

24
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:51,066
- Get down!
- Why?

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,108
I must steal something since
I've come. It's family business!

26
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:02,733
I'm Mogambo's nephew...
Gogo!

27
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:17,858
Gogo's stunts are incredible, aren't they?

28
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:30,315
This was your idea, wasn't it you rascal?

29
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,607
To please Karisma in order to
know more about Raveena?

30
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:36,273
Exactly! Did she tell you
something about Raveena?

31
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:39,357
What could she tell me?

32
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:43,858
Whenever I ask her about Raveena,
she gives me a cold stare.

33
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:49,023
Karisma has fallen in
love with you, sonny boy...

34
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:53,232
...and deep down in your
heart, you care for her, too.

35
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:56,650
Yes, that's true.
But how did you know?

36
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:04,315
You're crazy! Do I want to be
a Cook by marrying Karisma?!

37
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:07,023
- Want to return to Bhopal then?
- Oh no.

38
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:09,732
I will not concede defeat so soon.

39
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,732
This story will take a new
turn after the Intermission.

40
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:17,482
Only I will get married to Raveena!

41
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:21,400
- Where are you, Doctor Khurana?
- Hide! Quickly!

42
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:26,315
Here's a blanket!

43
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:29,899
- Who were you talking to?
- To myself.

44
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,399
- Who will listen to my woeful tale?
- I will...

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,899
- No!
- All day, all night...

46
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,525
...without batting an eyelid.
I will listen and listen...

47
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:48,650
I will... tell you the story some
other day. Now I must...

48
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,565
...prepare the patient's medicine.
- Why do you love him so much?

49
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:54,607
Love? If I could help it,
I would strangle him!

50
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,732
- What does that mean?
- I mean...

51
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,900
...I'd thrust the medicine down
his throat. So, he'd recover.

52
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:03,983
Where's the noise coming from?
What are you boiling?

53
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:07,691
It's my pain, actually!

54
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:09,399
There's pain there and here, too.

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,817
Everybody's under pressure.
What can one do?

56
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:17,316
Cure Tilu soon, so that we can
have some party and music.

57
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:21,440
Madam loves music a lot, anyway.

58
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:23,566
- Madam likes music, eh?
- Yes.

59
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:28,733
Raveena likes it?
Listen to it then!

60
00:05:30,692 --> 00:08:55,025
EROS

61
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:48,107
This poison is extracted
from a scorpion, Robert.

62
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:51,400
Mix just two drops in somebody's drinks...

63
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,150
...the one who drinks it,
turns blue and then yellow.

64
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,357
What happens after that, sir?

65
00:09:57,358 --> 00:10:02,066
After that he sleeps the
slumber of death forever.

66
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:06,608
- Economical and trusted.
- It must be effective, too?

67
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:11,691
It looks as if it's used on animals!

68
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:13,982
- Yes. On buffaloes.
- Buffaloes!

69
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:17,024
Hold him tight, Miss Raveena.

70
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:20,065
- I don't want it.
- But I must give it!

71
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:23,400
Remember, this poisoned drink is for Raveena.

72
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,857
I'll give it to her, sir.

73
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:30,773
I don't want it!
Leave me!

74
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:35,233
Let him give you the injection.
It's for your own good.

75
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:41,317
Do that again... run your
hands on my cheek, please!

76
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,816
It's coming back... my memory's returning!

77
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:52,274
- Your memory?!
- Do it again, please...

78
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:56,566
It's here! It's back!

79
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:03,357
Thank you, Miss Raveena!
I feel like...

80
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:08,733
I can't control my joy!
I don't know what I'm doing!

81
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:11,357
You understand, don't you?

82
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:14,732
You do?!

83
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:18,691
It's a miracle!
A miracle!

84
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:22,691
To celebrate this, give your
servants gifts on my behalf!

85
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,565
Give them a bonus and a day's holiday!

86
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:28,149
- We normally do this.
- You do?

87
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,358
I'm Amar Singh, son of the
landlord of Bhevnagar, Vikram Singh!

88
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,733
I have only two hobbies; hunting and soccer.

89
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,732
- I used to be a champion!
- Really?

90
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,523
I used to play for Mohan Bagan!

91
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:43,940
He's getting even crazier!
I must give him this injection!

92
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:47,065
Hey, doctor! Just take your fees and get lost!

93
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:49,149
He's really gone mad, Madam!

94
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,565
You're a servant, yet you climb
sofas and even call me mad, eh?

95
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:53,940
You are mad!

96
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:58,483
If you had recovered, the doctor
would have known. Right, doctor?

97
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:02,192
The patient first knows
whether he has recovered!

98
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:05,149
Try to understand, Madam...

99
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,523
You've changed colors ever
since the doctor has arrived!

100
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:09,648
Haven't you changed, too?

101
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:11,482
Is he the one being treated or is it you?

102
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:16,608
At this rate, you'll be a patient too!

103
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:23,565
It's Robert's birthday.

104
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:26,691
On this happy occasion, he
has prepared a special drink.

105
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:30,149
It's called the
"Drink of the Heavens"

106
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,107
You may present the drinks, Robert.

107
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:38,149
You didn't tell me it was my birthday.

108
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:51,316
Take this glass.

109
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:54,607
Please, sir...

110
00:12:54,608 --> 00:13:01,399
Cheers for Robert's birthday
and to my regained memory!

111
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:05,316
You think we'd really believe
you've regained your memory?

112
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,732
- What proof do you have?
- Proof? Idiot!

113
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:12,066
I remember everything!
I was a champion at football!

114
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:18,649
I even remember that historic match of 1988...

115
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:22,150
...when I scored six consecutive
goals for Mohan Bagan!

116
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:24,899
Let me show you how.
I was positioned here...

117
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,232
...and here was the
wicket-keeper of the opposition.

118
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:31,900
The goal-keeper, idiot!
This is soccer!

119
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:35,232
- Give me your glasses. Quick!
- Our glasses? Why?

120
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,107
- Come on!
- Here you are.

121
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,191
Strange servants this house has!

122
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:43,982
Your glasses! Climbs the sofa, insolent girl!

123
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:46,607
May I have your glass, too, Miss Raveena?

124
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,940
Let her finish her drink!

125
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,565
- Okay, you have it.
- No, I don't want it.

126
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:55,233
- Go ahead. It's your birthday!
- It's okay... play your game.

127
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:00,982
As I had the ball with me,
I was surrounded...

128
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:04,066
...I was here and there, there and here...

129
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:07,149
...left and right, fooling everyone of them...

130
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,858
...they kept running helter-skelter.
Making them dance, I approached...

131
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:14,650
...maneuvering my way to the goal-keeper...

132
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:18,441
I made the goal-keeper dance, too...
And then... GOAL!

133
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:23,649
Do you have your proof now?
Do you believe me? Yes!

134
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,941
- Here are your glasses.
- 'Our' glasses?

135
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,274
- Here are yours.
- No, thank you.

136
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:35,692
Strange servants. They now
refuse to take it! Take the glasses!

137
00:14:54,192 --> 00:15:00,191
Good... it's very good.

138
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:13,983
Why aren't you people drinking?
Go ahead. It's very good!

139
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,774
Don't show your teeth.
Drink it!

140
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:21,191
It's my birthday, Madam.
I'll drink last.

141
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,732
He's insulting you, Miss Raveena!

142
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:29,691
- What was that, Bhalla?
- I'll drink it, Madam.

143
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:35,150
Now... you drink.

144
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,774
There's something fishy here.

145
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:58,191
Go on, drink it!
Drink it!

146
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:04,274
Swallow it! Go on!
You'll get a blow! Swallow it!

147
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:09,691
I knew something of this sort would happen.

148
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:16,608
If we go on like this, we'll be
made the 'game' one day!

149
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:21,066
I've got great satisfaction!

150
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:24,107
Sorry, sir.
We made a mistake.

151
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,774
That younger boy...

152
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:30,399
Please don't worry, Mr. Teja.

153
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:36,150
Till when will the prey escape the lion?

154
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:42,150
According to my new plan...

155
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:46,357
What kind of people have you employed, Teja?

156
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:50,399
They wear suits worth Rs. 10,000 but
don't possess brains worth 10 paise!

157
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:54,941
You'll end up in a heap, if
you keep such company.

158
00:16:54,942 --> 00:16:57,440
You'll have to do something on your own, Teja!

159
00:16:57,441 --> 00:17:00,942
Stand on your own two feet.
Start now, Teja!

160
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,565
You both can't do a thing.

161
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:10,233
I think I'll have to deal with you now.

162
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:15,067
There's a fair being held
at Fort Mayavi tomorrow.

163
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:19,732
Both these girls will go to the fair, too.

164
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:22,148
They will be killed there.

165
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:24,066
Very good.

166
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,565
But I will come to the fair, too.

167
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:29,398
I'll deal the cards henceforth.

168
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:33,025
But those two jokers...
what's to be done with them?

169
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:37,900
They both are destined to die at my hands.

170
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:41,941
According to the plan...

171
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:45,025
Hurry up, Miss Raveena. There's
a time to get to the temple.

172
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:48,565
Only then are you granted your wish.

173
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,232
What are you looking back for?

174
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:53,482
Don't mention that inauspicious name now.

175
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:57,108
- Let's go, 'Uncle"...
- Well, my son...

176
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,774
...where are you taking your sister?

177
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:02,774
Sister? Are you blind?
Let's go!

178
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:04,982
Okay, sit down.

179
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:08,733
- Take my hand, dear.
- Yes, he's an old man.

180
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,149
What's the matter, dear?
Where's the glow of your face?

181
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:21,274
Maybe you had to accompany
someone else and are not!

182
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:26,525
O God! You and your ways!
Grapes for an ape!

183
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,899
You dare call her an ape?!

184
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,525
No, son...
I called her the grape...

185
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:38,148
Grape?! That's a nice fruit.

186
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:40,732
You can move a little, dear.

187
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,774
Don't touch her! Let's go!
Old ass!

188
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:47,066
Thinking of your father, son?
Let's go...

189
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:52,149
We'll go... from the presence of everybody else!

190
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:56,023
Let's go...

191
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:59,566
The rose fell off!
Get it back for her, son.

192
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:01,899
We're getting late.
I'll get you another.

193
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,023
What a shame!

194
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:07,107
Had the rose fallen off from my wife's hand...

195
00:19:07,108 --> 00:19:08,857
...I would have leapt after it!

196
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,232
Shame on the youngsters of the day!

197
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,691
- I'll get it.,
- Sit down.

198
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:16,482
You'll take ages!

199
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:19,607
Let's go!

200
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:23,774
Hey, old man!
Where are you taking her?!

201
00:20:24,566 --> 00:23:39,858
EROS

202
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:31,232
- You're very much 'that'.
- What?

203
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:34,940
- 'That'.
- What?

204
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:38,232
That!

205
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:44,399
'That', eh?
'That' I am.

206
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,649
The love-birds are here,
but where are my guys?

207
00:25:57,066 --> 00:26:00,442
- Where were you?
- We fell asleep, sir.

208
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:03,773
- Where's the gun?
- I have it, sir.

209
00:26:03,774 --> 00:26:06,274
Here it is.

210
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:09,524
- What's this?
- This is Vasco Da Gama's gun.

211
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:10,898
Which 'Mama' (Uncle)

212
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:13,065
It's Vasco Da Gama's gun.

213
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,648
You don't have to aim with this.

214
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:22,025
Just imagine the guy and fire... it finds its target!

215
00:26:36,317 --> 00:26:41,566
Let me take a look, Sir.

216
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:49,942
What was that?

217
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:57,066
What do you think went wrong?

218
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:10,066
That's life, pal...
You win some, lose some.

219
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:14,983
It's all part of the game.
Hadn't I asked you to return?

220
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:17,565
That you couldn't win here?

221
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:21,066
Just think; there's such a difference
between you and Raveena.

222
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:25,983
You need looks and luck to
marry such a wealthy girl.

223
00:27:26,524 --> 00:27:30,025
You lack both.

224
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,357
I know very well...

225
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:37,192
...the broken heart, affects the brains, too.

226
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:42,566
Look what I've got.
Rum to drive away sorrows...

227
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:45,065
Have this tonight, to lessen
your burden of sorrow.

228
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:48,732
But don't get hooked; it affects your liver.

229
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,565
I've got something to talk to you about.

230
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:54,065
Go upstairs. I've no time.
Talk to Prem.

231
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:56,232
You're misunderstanding me.

232
00:27:56,233 --> 00:28:01,358
I don't talk to servants.
Good-bye.

233
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,732
I want to say something to you, Prem.

234
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:13,441
But that shouldn't affect our relationship.

235
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:18,691
Relationship? What relationship?
You're a strange girl!

236
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,192
I'm not what you think I am.

237
00:28:22,608 --> 00:28:25,232
- Meaning?
- I'm not Karisma.

238
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:26,982
What difference does it make?

239
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:32,441
If not Karisma, you could be
Jamila, Shakila, Sunita or Papita...

240
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,358
...whatever you are, my boat has capsized!

241
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,108
You see, that
Raveena is not Raveena...

242
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:45,565
...she's me and I'm her.

243
00:28:45,566 --> 00:28:48,065
You are not you, it's her...

244
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:51,815
...she's not her, she's you.

245
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:54,316
You are not you and she's not her.

246
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:59,524
Am 'I' what I am, or not what I am?

247
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:01,482
Who am 'I'?

248
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:04,775
Idiot! I'm Ramgopal Bajaj's
daughter, Raveena Bajaj.

249
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:08,565
She's our accountant
Harishankar's daughter, Karisma.

250
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,940
- What?!
- Yes.

251
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:13,982
We had swapped names.

252
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:19,192
I wanted a boy to love me, and not my wealth.

253
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,775
And that love...
I've found in your eyes, Prem.

254
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,858
Really?

255
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:38,857
I have never liked India.

256
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:42,232
Even my friends used to tell me this.

257
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:46,232
"Amar, you're not made for this country"

258
00:29:46,233 --> 00:29:50,191
"You should be elsewhere"

259
00:29:50,192 --> 00:29:54,858
It's good that you came from
abroad and like a jeweler...

260
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:58,398
...recognized a diamond.

261
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,857
Otherwise, the people here
are, well... like Indians.

262
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:04,398
They could never know my true worth.

263
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,149
I've been trying to tell you...

264
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:12,566
You're trying to say that after
marriage we'll stay in London.

265
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:16,066
That we will have to do.

266
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:19,399
To handle the huge business
empire of your father...

267
00:30:19,816 --> 00:30:22,815
...I'll have to stay in London.

268
00:30:22,816 --> 00:30:27,648
You want to share your joy.

269
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:32,565
I believe in that, too.
Excuse me...

270
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:38,900
The evening shall be spent in our name.

271
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:44,108
The champagne and dinner for the
evening, for all of you, is on us!

272
00:30:45,316 --> 00:30:49,816
Applause!

273
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:56,316
- How's that possible?
- You see, I can understand you.

274
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:27,315
Poor chap.

275
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:30,191
I think he's drunk everything.

276
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:33,440
It happens...

277
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:36,900
...a broken heart affects the brains.

278
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:43,149
Now, what can be done?
I tried to make him understand.

279
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,815
To return to Bhopal.

280
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:48,942
That nothing was possible here.
But he wouldn't listen.

281
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:52,024
- Now listen Amar...
- It's too late.

282
00:31:52,025 --> 00:31:56,192
The poor chap's youth will
be spent in an asylum.

283
00:31:56,816 --> 00:32:00,899
- Why don't you understand, Amar!
- Please explain, Raveena.

284
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,441
I'm not Raveena, I'm Karishma.
She's Raveena Bajaj.

285
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:07,149
She's Ramgopal Bajaj's only heir.

286
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,149
I'm his accountant,
Harishankar's daughter.

287
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,024
I did all this at
Raveena's instructions.

288
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:16,775
Prem... is not crazy.
He's dancing in glee.

289
00:32:17,691 --> 00:32:21,232
Raveena must have told him the truth.

290
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:24,565
Prem has won what you badly wanted.

291
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:30,567
I have no wealth, Amar.
I have nothing.

292
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,565
It's good that we took this route, isn't it?

293
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:01,608
Or Gogo would have held us!
How was the idea?

294
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,190
- Where's your boss, Teja?
- We don't know.

295
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:10,524
Why do you always harass us because of him?

296
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:13,732
I won't spare him.
I'll have his eye-balls for marbles!

297
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:16,607
- I want my money!
- You'll get your money!

298
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:19,107
Teja's brother is bringing
diamonds from London.

299
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:22,357
He'll sell the diamonds and pay you off!

300
00:33:22,358 --> 00:33:24,398
- I don't want the money.
- Good.

301
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,398
I want the diamonds!

302
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:29,899
- Get down!
- Why?

303
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,441
I'll steal something, since
I'm here! It's family business!

304
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:39,108
Mogambo's nephew, Gogo!

305
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:43,650
He took our scooter the last
time and our bicycle now...

306
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:46,607
...and the next time...

307
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,941
Did you see that?
Gogo's gimmicks?!

308
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:56,482
He's not at the bus-stop
and not at the tea-shop...

309
00:33:56,483 --> 00:33:59,690
- Where have you been?
- Why? What's wrong?

310
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:02,232
Nothing yet...
But she went away crying.

311
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:03,857
Who?
Which Raveena?

312
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:07,148
The one who was first
Raveena and is now Karisma?

313
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:10,191
Is it the one who pretended to be the servant?

314
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:12,816
Or is it the one who
pretended to be money-bags?

315
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,941
- 'Your' Raveena!
- What happened to her?

316
00:34:14,942 --> 00:34:18,148
She went away crying.
She said she'd commit suicide.

317
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:20,482
- What are you saying?
- Read it.

318
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:25,275
- Where did she go?
- There.

319
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:43,399
What's wrong?
Why are you screaming?

320
00:34:43,942 --> 00:34:45,857
What happened?
I almost died!

321
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:49,315
What does this mean?
What have you written?

322
00:34:49,316 --> 00:34:52,148
What's wrong with that?
I really came here to die...

323
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:55,857
...but I found it a bit too high.

324
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:59,357
I'll jump from down below.
It'll hurt less.

325
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:02,899
- What nonsense is this?
- What's my life to you, anyway?

326
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,982
Your love for me wasn't real in any case.

327
00:35:06,983 --> 00:35:10,107
Look Raveena... I mean, Karisma...

328
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,357
Look at me...
Look into my eyes.

329
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,899
Does my love seem fake to you?

330
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,565
I admit I had come to enact a farce.

331
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:23,732
But I've really fallen in love with you.

332
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:27,441
Whoever you are, however you are... I love you.

333
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:30,899
Your friend has hurt my friend's heart.

334
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,607
If something happens to her...

335
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:36,358
...I'll never forgive you!

336
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:40,149
- But Karisma...
- Not Karisma, Raveena!

337
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:46,149
My friend talks a lot, but he's a nice chap.

338
00:35:46,692 --> 00:35:48,941
He'd never hurt your friend.

339
00:35:48,942 --> 00:35:51,649
She's gone to end her life!
What about that?

340
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,565
- Nothing.
- What?

341
00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:58,024
Amar could even con the
God of Death and bring Him here.

342
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:03,774
They'll be here any moment, arm in arm.

343
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:07,732
- Where were you?
- She went to end her life.

344
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:11,732
She wanted less height.
I brought her back.

345
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:13,982
- Didn't I say, Karisma...
- What did you say?

346
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:17,607
- It's very confusing!
- Oh yes, it is!

347
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:21,692
This is a great problem.

348
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,065
We're not concerned with
what your real names are...

349
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:32,400
...your names will be what
we have always called you!

350
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,107
At least meet Amar and Prem once, Dad.

351
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:43,315
We've known them well.
They're one in a million.

352
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:46,899
They're not only handsome,
but able and sensible too.

353
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,482
It's 8 'O Clock.
Where's my newspaper?

354
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:53,315
Everything should be done at its time.

355
00:36:53,316 --> 00:36:56,524
- Prem is a very good man.
- Amar's good at heart.

356
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:58,732
- They're wonderful.
- Intelligent.

357
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:02,274
- Handsome, wise...
- Good-hearted...

358
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:05,190
Where's my tea?

359
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:07,899
There's a time for everything.

360
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:15,900
I've been hearing about them since I've arrived.

361
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,565
Nobody seems to be asking about me.

362
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:21,023
Call them at 7 tomorrow.

363
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:25,024
Is it time for the sugar, sir?

364
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:29,148
Listen carefully or you could ruin everything.

365
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:31,898
- Uncle speaks little.
- Hears little, too.

366
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:35,065
- Is he deaf?
- Don't talk nonsense with him.

367
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:38,483
- Don't be quiet out of fear, okay?
- What's there to fear?

368
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:42,399
It's a matter of love.
Of getting married...

369
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,232
...we marry at home with
consent; in the temple without it...

370
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:50,358
- Right?
- I thought so too.

371
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:11,399
Put your hands down.
You're three minutes late!

372
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,482
Do you know the value of three minutes?

373
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:16,898
One can finalize deals worth
crores in that much time!

374
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:19,566
I had reserved six minutes for you.

375
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:22,399
Three minutes for you to
speak and three for me.

376
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,023
You've lost your three minutes;
Now only listen...

377
00:38:26,024 --> 00:38:29,692
Amar and Prem...

378
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:35,024
...full of purity and devotion.

379
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:40,441
Your names had suggested that you
were glamour-struck vagabonds.

380
00:38:41,858 --> 00:38:45,607
But you're useless parasites, too.

381
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:48,733
While you do certainly
look like illiterate bums...

382
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,233
...you proved to be greater fools when you...

383
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,066
...thought I'd agree to this match.

384
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:01,107
My three minutes are not up.

385
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,566
I've brought up these girls with
a lot of love and affection.

386
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:06,149
But I think they need medical help...

387
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,524
...because they've chosen rascals like you.

388
00:39:08,525 --> 00:39:13,233
Pull the finger out of the mouth and get lost!

389
00:39:14,483 --> 00:39:16,566
- What happened?
- What else?

390
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,232
He tried to throw his weight
around and started bragging.

391
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,065
About his achievements and status.

392
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:23,399
I told him that we were not
concerned with whatever he was!

393
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,732
It's for you to see, as to how we are!

394
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:28,649
Quiet!
He was absolutely quiet!

395
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,691
He really felt that what
I had said made sense.

396
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:34,898
- Tell them what I said, too.
- Oh yes!

397
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:37,732
His spirits also rose, when he
saw me. What's that you said?

398
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:40,858
I shut him up! I gave 2 answers
for each of his question.

399
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:44,107
There was one question, and two answers...!

400
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:47,190
It was only questions and
answers and then... silence!

401
00:39:47,191 --> 00:39:52,150
A long silence...

402
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:57,358
You should do something to win his respect.

403
00:39:57,899 --> 00:40:03,650
For instance, suppose Ramgopal
Bajaj gets into some problem...

404
00:40:04,108 --> 00:40:06,691
...and you rescue him!

405
00:40:06,692 --> 00:40:10,065
He himself is the 'problem'!
What problem will be get into?

406
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:11,399
Bloody Hitler!

407
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,733
Just suppose the old man gets kidnapped...

408
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:18,649
...and the two of you risk your lives to save him!

409
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,691
Won't both of you be heroes then?

410
00:40:20,692 --> 00:40:22,982
Is that a marriage-plan or a death-trap?

411
00:40:22,983 --> 00:40:24,815
He's talking about risking lives!

412
00:40:24,816 --> 00:40:27,691
We won't risk our lives!
Who'll kidnap him anyway?

413
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:30,399
We will kidnap him.

414
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,525
We'll ask for a ransom of 5 lakhs,
but you come and rescue him!

415
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:40,275
Isn't the problem solved?
Very simple!

416
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,649
The man's a real 'clock', sir!

417
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,107
He has things planned for every single second!

418
00:40:48,108 --> 00:40:52,815
You should call him the HMT
instead of Ramgopal Bajaj!

419
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:58,816
- So you're Teja's goons, eh?
- Not I, sir, it's him!

420
00:41:00,316 --> 00:41:02,482
- It's him...
- He brought me here!

421
00:41:02,483 --> 00:41:05,399
You work for him and even lie about it!

422
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,525
We work for him? Oh no!
He's a first-rate rascal, sir!

423
00:41:10,191 --> 00:41:13,650
Let's go the Police Station, sir...

424
00:41:13,983 --> 00:41:16,732
...we'll have him reported
and thrown behind bars!

425
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:18,732
I'll finish of your game!

426
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:21,649
Dealing my cards in my absence, eh?

427
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,399
Mr. Teja!
I always knew!

428
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,441
You've really pulled off this gimmick, sir!

429
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:29,773
I imitate him well, don't I?

430
00:41:29,774 --> 00:41:33,150
- We both were fooled.
- Everybody else will be, too!

431
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:37,608
What I have to decide is
how to get into his house now!

432
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:44,274
I'll make the plan for that, too.

433
00:41:45,899 --> 00:41:49,358
- He gets up at 6 every morning.
- And goes jogging after that!

434
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:54,858
- He jogs near the Ladies Hostel.
- Voyeuristic chap, sir!

435
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:58,608
- He reads the papers at 7 a.m.
- And bathes at 7.30, sharp.

436
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:04,025
Sitting in the garden, he reads the
newspaper for exactly 9.30 minutes.

437
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:08,816
- He's at the Golf Club at 9 a.m.
- Knows nothing, but plays Golf too!

438
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:15,191
Then, for exactly 13 minutes, he
walks about the golf-course all alone.

439
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:21,358
That's it!
When he's alone!

440
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:50,650
Fresh lime juice.

441
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:20,316
He must be kidnapped by now!
There will be a phone call, too!

442
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:23,733
Don't you go on ranting in there.
You'll spoil the whole show.

443
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,773
Just stay by my side silently.

444
00:43:25,774 --> 00:43:27,232
I only meant to help you, pal.

445
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:33,025
You want to get married?
Then please don't help me!

446
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,483
- You're looking very beautiful.
- Is Daddy at home?

447
00:43:39,191 --> 00:43:41,399
Why are both of you so quiet?

448
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,025
- Has your Dad scolded you again?
- There's no trace of Dad.

449
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:47,399
He hasn't even returned home.

450
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,149
He hasn't been kidnapped, has he?

451
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,857
He talks nonsense.
Your Dad will be back.

452
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:56,399
I'm getting scared.
There isn't even a telephone call.

453
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,400
There will be a telephone call soon!

454
00:44:03,983 --> 00:44:08,983
What?!

455
00:44:09,317 --> 00:44:11,982
Uncle has been kidnapped!
The ransom is Rs.50 lakhs!

456
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:16,441
- 50 lakhs?!
- Give the phone to me...

457
00:44:16,442 --> 00:44:20,191
Ask them why it is 50 lakhs...
It's disconnected?

458
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:23,566
Please don't worry...
Your father is our father!

459
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,732
We'll risk our
lives to save him!

460
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:28,773
We'll be back in a jiffy!

461
00:44:28,774 --> 00:44:34,858
I mean, it'll be difficult!
Please don't cry... you too.

462
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:37,773
The plan's successful!

463
00:44:37,774 --> 00:44:39,732
The girls and the old man will be happy!

464
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:42,357
Congratulations on the Wedding!

465
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:45,441
Hey listen!

466
00:44:45,442 --> 00:44:49,108
Uncle hasn't been kidnapped.
It's all a stunt of Amar and Prem.

467
00:44:49,566 --> 00:44:52,065
- How do you know?
- I heard them talking.

468
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:54,565
- They planned to please uncle.
- How's that?

469
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:58,066
They'll first have him kidnapped
and them have him released...

470
00:44:58,442 --> 00:45:01,399
...they'll be heroes in his opinion, right?

471
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,442
Yes! But how much of trouble
they've put us through.

472
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,732
We'll teach them a lesson, too.

473
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:10,399
It's incredible!

474
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,065
Honestly tell us, for how long
have you been in this business?

475
00:45:13,066 --> 00:45:15,690
What's up now?

476
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:18,065
Instead of asking for 5 lakhs,
why did you ask for 50?

477
00:45:18,066 --> 00:45:20,940
- Oh no!
- It's okay if you asked...

478
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:24,065
...but who's going to pay up?

479
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:27,107
We haven't asked for Rs.50 lakhs...
He has.

480
00:45:27,108 --> 00:45:29,024
- Who's 'he'?
- Yes, who's 'he'?

481
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:31,440
The one who kidnapped
Ramgopal Bajaj.

482
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:34,232
- What did you say?
- I'll explain...

483
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:36,732
Everything went off according to our plan...

484
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,648
...we even had him in our trap.
But then...

485
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:42,565
There was a sudden attack on our heads.

486
00:45:42,566 --> 00:45:44,690
The earth split, the heavens fell and...

487
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:46,732
Cut out the details!

488
00:45:46,733 --> 00:45:49,482
This has turned serious, Prem.

489
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:55,191
There seems to be an
organized gang behind all this.

490
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:03,899
You're looking very smart today.

491
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,149
Has Uncle returned?

492
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,983
- He will.
- He's been kidnapped by a big gang.

493
00:46:12,524 --> 00:46:15,440
We know that.

494
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:18,648
They've asked for Rs.50 lakhs.
The money will be paid.

495
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:22,358
It's okay... he's their father.
They're not bothered. Why should we?

496
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:26,899
Sit down. There's food here.
Let's eat.

497
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,524
- You don't seem to understand...
- A big gang and a small amount...

498
00:46:30,858 --> 00:46:33,732
...only Rs.50 lakhs?!

499
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:36,482
Rs.50 lakhs?!

500
00:46:36,483 --> 00:46:39,900
That's too much!
We were asking only for Rs.5 lakhs.

501
00:46:40,566 --> 00:46:43,149
And he felt that was too much, too!

502
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:47,858
He should be ashamed!

503
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:51,649
You've arranged for the money, haven't you?

504
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:55,316
We have your bosses here.
Talk to them.

505
00:46:55,317 --> 00:46:58,483
My boss?!
Who's this boss of mine?!

506
00:47:05,733 --> 00:47:09,566
- This is Amar speaking.
- Give the phone to Raveena, punk!

507
00:47:11,816 --> 00:47:15,690
- He wants to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk.

508
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:18,690
Tell me, what is it?

509
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:21,107
Give the phone to
Raveena, will you?!

510
00:47:21,108 --> 00:47:25,275
- He wants to talk to you.
- He's your man. You talk to him.

511
00:47:28,983 --> 00:47:31,107
They're not willing to talk.
Tell me whatever it is.

512
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:34,482
You donkey, idiot, scoundrel... rascal, ape...

513
00:47:34,483 --> 00:47:36,607
You're a donkey and your father, too!

514
00:47:36,608 --> 00:47:39,191
Speak now or I'll disconnect!

515
00:47:39,192 --> 00:47:42,358
Listen!
Ramgopal Bajaj is in our custody.

516
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:48,150
If you want him alive, come to
the old temple with Rs.50 lakhs.

517
00:47:48,816 --> 00:47:52,733
If you act smart, we'll
knock him off. Understand?

518
00:47:53,192 --> 00:47:57,858
Your father's kidnapped, and
you're not even talking to him!

519
00:47:59,691 --> 00:48:02,649
Enough is enough!
There's a limit to these jokes.

520
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,357
Now go and bring my father home.

521
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:06,690
We have not kidnapped your father.

522
00:48:06,691 --> 00:48:12,150
But I heard you talking about
your plans. What about that?

523
00:48:12,816 --> 00:48:16,025
Prem will explain that to you.
Explain it to them, Prem.

524
00:48:32,733 --> 00:48:34,899
Yes.
That is exactly how it happened.

525
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,315
It means, our men did really try to kidnap him...

526
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:40,357
...but he was kidnapped by these guys.

527
00:48:40,358 --> 00:48:43,232
What?!

528
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:46,398
Has Daddy really been kidnapped?!

529
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:49,607
Now look; it's our mistake...

530
00:48:49,608 --> 00:48:53,232
...we will even risk our lives to save him.

531
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:55,191
Your father is...

532
00:48:55,192 --> 00:48:58,565
...well, not out father.
Our fathers are back home.

533
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:01,191
- Let's go.
- You can cry if you wish.

534
00:49:01,192 --> 00:49:05,440
- Here's a napkin.
- Let's go.

535
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:09,815
So, you converted your
earnings into diamonds, eh?

536
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:15,941
- How did you know?
- How did I know, eh?!

537
00:49:16,524 --> 00:49:19,565
I won't give you the diamonds, even if I die.

538
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:24,607
Who'll bother you if you're dead anyway?

539
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:27,775
Now listen Ramu... quietly
give me the locker-number...

540
00:49:28,316 --> 00:49:31,232
...I'm being tolerant because
you're my brother...

541
00:49:31,233 --> 00:49:33,357
...or I would have finished you off long ago!

542
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:36,440
I've asked for Rs.50 lakhs, for your safety.

543
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:39,691
Your daughters must be on
their way with the money.

544
00:49:40,566 --> 00:49:44,024
With Rs.50 lakhs, the police will be silenced...

545
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:47,482
...and I'll lead a peaceful
life as Ramgopal Bajaj.

546
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:50,066
Neither will the locker be out
of reach, nor the number.

547
00:49:50,067 --> 00:49:55,567
Certainly not the keys, and
not at all the diamonds!

548
00:50:07,566 --> 00:50:11,067
I asked for Rs.50 lakhs...
they're carrying it in that bag!?

549
00:50:12,233 --> 00:50:16,982
- Must be 50 checks of a lakh each!
- Shut up!

550
00:50:16,983 --> 00:50:20,857
I'll go and find out.

551
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:24,107
Amar... let's return.

552
00:50:24,108 --> 00:50:26,816
He hasn't turned up.
I don't think he will.

553
00:50:26,817 --> 00:50:29,899
I want to urinate... we'll
return tomorrow morning.

554
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,899
Wait.
Getting scared, are you?

555
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,525
No, not scared... I'm a bit frightened of nights.

556
00:50:36,025 --> 00:50:41,483
Why get frightened?
I'm with you! Don't be...

557
00:50:42,399 --> 00:50:45,024
- Why are you screaming?!
- Don't scream!

558
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:48,233
- What is it?
- Where's the dough?

559
00:50:48,566 --> 00:50:50,315
- Here it is...
- Wait!

560
00:50:50,316 --> 00:50:52,232
- Where's uncle?
- Where's the money?

561
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:55,525
- Here it is!
- Look, we're not novices...

562
00:50:56,025 --> 00:50:58,398
...we want to see uncle, before
we show you the money. Right?

563
00:50:58,399 --> 00:51:00,941
- See this...
- What is it? What is...

564
00:51:00,942 --> 00:51:05,858
Give it to him! Hurry up!
What are you waiting for?

565
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,148
- This is small change!
- Small change?

566
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:15,148
It nothing less than Rs. 8,535.39!

567
00:51:15,149 --> 00:51:18,066
Do you think I'd rob a piggy-bank?

568
00:51:18,067 --> 00:51:20,565
This isn't ransom, it's more
like a donation for funerals!

569
00:51:20,566 --> 00:51:23,649
- We've brought all we had.
- Yes...

570
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,690
I had asked for Rs.50 lakhs.
Where is it?

571
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:28,024
Where will we get
Rs.50 lakhs from?

572
00:51:28,025 --> 00:51:29,982
- Why?
- You have a faulty plan!

573
00:51:29,983 --> 00:51:32,565
You kidnapped the father
and asked the daughter.

574
00:51:32,566 --> 00:51:35,774
You should have kidnapped the
daughter and threatened the father!

575
00:51:35,775 --> 00:51:38,232
You've got it all wrong!
He seems to be a novice!

576
00:51:38,233 --> 00:51:42,899
- Shut up! Or I'll shoot you!
- Sorry!

577
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,315
Get Ramu ready.

578
00:51:45,316 --> 00:51:48,273
They've brought only Rs.7,000.

579
00:51:48,274 --> 00:51:52,024
Didn't I say they're smart?
The shorter one...

580
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:55,065
We'll manage with this.

581
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:57,315
Don't you dare touch the money.

582
00:51:57,316 --> 00:52:01,065
Keep an eye on Ramgopal;
I'll keep coming.

583
00:52:01,066 --> 00:52:03,232
I'm leaving now; don't spend a penny.

584
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:06,274
- Uncle's come!
- We risked our lives for you!

585
00:52:06,692 --> 00:52:11,148
- Okay, let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

586
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:13,899
- You can sit behind.
- Come here, in the middle.

587
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,732
- Push up a little. Come here...
- Yes... but how will I drive?

588
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,941
Are you comfortable?

589
00:52:18,942 --> 00:52:21,524
- Sit on the bar there.
- Yes, on the bar here.

590
00:52:21,525 --> 00:52:24,440
But how will I drive?
Sit in his lap, uncle!

591
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,565
- Yes, in my lap!
- Get down!

592
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:28,440
Sit in his lap, they say!
Get down!

593
00:52:28,441 --> 00:52:33,692
He's an idiot... he won't even
know we're sitting here!

594
00:52:37,024 --> 00:52:38,816
Get this thing, clearly.

595
00:52:38,817 --> 00:52:42,190
If you love us, you'll have to
forsake your father and his wealth.

596
00:52:42,191 --> 00:52:44,023
We agree, Prem...

597
00:52:44,024 --> 00:52:47,066
...but father has changed a lot.

598
00:52:47,817 --> 00:52:51,566
For someone who used to hate
liquor, he simply gulps it down!

599
00:52:52,191 --> 00:52:54,941
Do you know the kind of foul language he uses!

600
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:56,399
It happens...

601
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,566
...it's the gangsters' influence
on him. Forget him!

602
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:04,525
- He's spoilt!
- Hitler is a write-off, eh?!

603
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:06,857
This is no time to joke.

604
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:10,817
He searched the house the other day,
as he were a cop in a thief's house!

605
00:53:12,024 --> 00:53:14,732
He overturned the entire house last night.

606
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:20,608
- Overturned?
- Overturned?!

607
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,982
What's this?
Uncle? In this condition?

608
00:54:23,983 --> 00:54:30,067
My God!
The world changes in seconds!

609
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,274
It's good that Karisma and
Raveena didn't come, too.

610
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:42,441
They would have wept, had
they seen this side of him.

611
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:47,315
I'm thinking of his late wife.

612
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:52,566
- Her soul must be in turmoil now!
- Great turmoil!

613
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:55,692
But so quickly?
He was okay just now.

614
00:54:56,775 --> 00:54:59,607
He's okay even now.

615
00:54:59,608 --> 00:55:02,065
But since when has he picked up these vices?

616
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:07,524
- I think there's some suspense.
- Suspense?

617
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:17,399
- The film 'Seeta Aur Geeta'!
- No! It was 'Ram Aur Shyam'!

618
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:23,066
Not one, but two uncles!

619
00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:26,357
There's only one uncle.
The other's a look-alike.

620
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:28,732
Just like him!

621
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:30,982
- Let's go to the police.
- No, not the police.

622
00:55:30,983 --> 00:55:33,607
This is the opportunity to
turn heroes in his opinion.

623
00:55:33,608 --> 00:55:36,816
- How?
- Somehow or the other...

624
00:55:37,108 --> 00:55:42,691
...we have to lock up the fake
one and pull out the real uncle!

625
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:45,898
Do you think I'd tell your clowns
about the diamonds, too?

626
00:55:45,899 --> 00:55:48,898
- What?
- I'll give you the diamonds.

627
00:55:48,899 --> 00:55:52,400
I?
I'll own Rs.30 crores?

628
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:56,274
I'll lead a decent life now.

629
00:55:56,275 --> 00:56:01,525
I'll fulfill a dream that I had in
the corner of my heart for years.

630
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,065
I'll start a poultry farm.

631
00:56:07,066 --> 00:56:10,775
I'll have thousands of birds.

632
00:56:11,899 --> 00:56:14,190
Which will lay lakhs of eggs.

633
00:56:14,191 --> 00:56:18,983
That will lead to many crore
new birds and many more eggs!

634
00:56:19,941 --> 00:56:22,773
And billions of omelets!

635
00:56:22,774 --> 00:56:26,898
I'll supply the bread to eat those eggs too.

636
00:56:26,899 --> 00:56:29,357
I'll even have a bakery.

637
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:33,650
The Ling of Bakeries... and
the Emperor of Omelets!

638
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:39,399
"Our own Bajaj..."

639
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,566
You'll make omelets with
my hard-earned money, eh?

640
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:51,358
You'll start a bakery for the bread, too, eh?

641
00:57:04,858 --> 00:57:08,108
Oh God!
Thank you very much!

642
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:13,483
What are you animals doing here?

643
00:57:14,233 --> 00:57:19,233
We were awaiting you, uncle!

644
00:57:20,525 --> 00:57:26,691
He looks just like our Uncle!

645
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:30,607
All that free food has made him fat!

646
00:57:30,608 --> 00:57:32,190
We'll cut him down to size!

647
00:57:32,191 --> 00:57:35,566
Uncle, get up!
We're here, Uncle!

648
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:38,399
Hurry up, uncle!
Let's go home!

649
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,898
Raveena and Karisma are
awaiting you there. Let's go!

650
00:57:40,899 --> 00:57:44,108
- We risked our lives to save you.
- Yes, that's true!

651
00:57:44,899 --> 00:57:46,732
Bravo! Bravo!

652
00:57:46,733 --> 00:57:52,567
Tie him up, properly.
Lest he escapes again.

653
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:58,566
Yes! Let's do it again!

654
00:57:59,066 --> 00:58:01,607
- What's this, uncle?
- I'm not 'uncle'!

655
00:58:01,608 --> 00:58:06,773
I'm Teja!

656
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,566
He cleverly locked me in...

657
00:58:09,567 --> 00:58:15,607
...and you cleverly pulled
me out and put him in!

658
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:20,691
Amuse yourself with rummy.
I'm off to play my game! Bye!

659
00:58:21,483 --> 00:58:24,983
You're all mixed up, Uncle!
You're the real uncle!

660
00:58:25,774 --> 00:58:29,025
Forget him and take care of
this chap. He can get violent!

661
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:31,274
I'll kill both of you!

662
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:33,566
He's not uncle,
I am!

663
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:36,065
You should have at least asked me who I was!

664
00:58:36,066 --> 00:58:38,107
I had got out with great difficulty!

665
00:58:38,108 --> 00:58:43,774
I knew when I first saw you that
you're the greatest fools ever!

666
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:47,773
I still haven't cooled down.

667
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:52,065
Donkeys! Owls! Apes! Illiterate bums...

668
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:55,149
Don't you dare utter another word!

669
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:58,190
We were just beginning to understand
who's Karisma and who's Raveena...

670
00:58:58,191 --> 00:59:01,857
...and here's another!
Who's uncle?!

671
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:03,898
Is this a family-disease?

672
00:59:03,899 --> 00:59:07,400
Is it our mistake that you resemble each other?

673
00:59:08,191 --> 00:59:10,732
Had we asked your parents
to give birth to twins?

674
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:14,190
That too, a crook like him?!
What is to be done now?

675
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:20,191
Don't you dare move!

676
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:26,191
Don't wipe that off!

677
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:36,108
Come now...
Let's think of something.

678
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,566
What I can't understand, sir...

679
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:44,648
...is why do Hindi films portray
gangsters and villains...

680
00:59:44,649 --> 00:59:47,399
...as stupid and morons?

681
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,607
Because all of them are not smart as we are.

682
00:59:51,608 --> 00:59:55,150
- Where the hell were you?!
- What is that to you?

683
00:59:55,483 --> 00:59:59,025
I'm Teja...
Open the door!

684
00:59:59,483 --> 01:00:02,607
- So, you're Teja, eh?
- I... speak up!

685
01:00:02,608 --> 01:00:04,274
This man is Teja.

686
01:00:04,275 --> 01:00:07,149
If this is Teja, who is that man outside?

687
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:10,691
He was Ramgopal Bajaj.
He tricked me and locked me inside!

688
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,190
Then why did he leave these clowns with you?

689
01:00:14,191 --> 01:00:17,316
Why don't you speak?!

690
01:00:17,317 --> 01:00:20,649
You don't understand; He doesn't
want us to marry his daughters!

691
01:00:21,275 --> 01:00:23,024
That's why he's
locked us inside.

692
01:00:23,025 --> 01:00:26,565
- Look at this mark!
- Mark?

693
01:00:26,566 --> 01:00:28,232
What mark is that?

694
01:00:28,233 --> 01:00:31,400
Look at this pack of cards...
Your game will be over!

695
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,940
These are Teja's cards...
We've made a mistake!

696
01:00:35,941 --> 01:00:39,025
- Open them! Where are the keys!?
- I'll finish the game!

697
01:00:39,524 --> 01:00:43,566
- Hurry up, Robert.
- I'll finish your game!

698
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:48,025
I hope you didn't have any difficulty in there, sir.

699
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,773
Don't touch us!

700
01:00:50,774 --> 01:00:53,357
We'll handle everything now.
Explain everything, Teja.

701
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:57,900
- What's there to explain?
- They are very understanding...

702
01:00:58,275 --> 01:01:00,399
...their faces tell us how smart they are.

703
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,733
Don't smile! Straighten your cap and follow me!

704
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:11,857
This is Prem here.
We're bringing Uncle...

705
01:01:11,858 --> 01:01:14,065
...till then, keep an eye on Uncle.

706
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:17,065
- Aw, shut up!
- What's he saying?

707
01:01:17,066 --> 01:01:20,399
That man at home is not uncle.
He's an impostor.

708
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,107
He's Teja. Keep an eye on
him till we reach there.

709
01:01:24,108 --> 01:01:28,232
But he's just
left with the keys!

710
01:01:28,233 --> 01:01:29,773
He must have gone to the bank.

711
01:01:29,774 --> 01:01:32,316
Don't worry.
We'll send the real uncle home...

712
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:38,733
...and go to the bank to
nab the fake one. Let's go.

713
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:43,024
There he goes! Catch him!

714
01:01:43,025 --> 01:01:48,025
Wait!
I was a champ at stone-throwing!

715
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,024
It's found the mark!
'Rabbit' throws well!

716
01:01:55,025 --> 01:01:57,191
Robert, not Rabbit!
Hurry!

717
01:01:57,192 --> 01:02:00,065
We've found the diamonds, sir.

718
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:01,607
Bravo!

719
01:02:01,608 --> 01:02:04,983
We'll call Teja and tell him we've
found this. He'll reward you!

720
01:02:06,192 --> 01:02:09,566
Till Teja recovers...
I mean, keep hitting him!

721
01:02:10,108 --> 01:02:17,192
They'll call Teja and ask him
to kill this chap. And then...

722
01:02:19,066 --> 01:02:24,358
My dear!

723
01:02:26,566 --> 01:02:28,316
My name is Crime Master Gogo!

724
01:02:28,317 --> 01:02:30,191
I'll have his eye-balls for marbles!

725
01:02:30,192 --> 01:02:33,066
I won't spare anyone!
Not even Teja!

726
01:02:33,067 --> 01:02:37,815
- He's my father, not Teja.
- Teja's gone to the bank.

727
01:02:37,816 --> 01:02:43,441
What's this fuss about?
Take all of them with us!

728
01:02:43,566 --> 01:02:47,565
They disappeared after
they went to make that call.

729
01:02:47,566 --> 01:02:51,067
Where's your boss, Teja?
Where are my diamonds?

730
01:02:51,858 --> 01:02:55,066
- He's gone to fetch the girls.
- Amar's giving the diamonds to Teja.

731
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:57,982
- Bajaj is lying there.
- Bajaj is in the car!

732
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:03,941
- No, this is Bajaj.
- Bajaj is in my car!

733
01:03:13,649 --> 01:03:15,690
Hey! Where are you going?

734
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,774
- I was looking for you.
- Why?

735
01:03:17,775 --> 01:03:20,357
He's disappeared with uncle and the two girls.

736
01:03:20,358 --> 01:03:22,732
- Who?
- Crime Master Gogo.

737
01:03:22,733 --> 01:03:27,524
He's asked you to reach here with
the diamonds if you want them alive.

738
01:03:28,566 --> 01:03:31,899
And he's also said that if you inform the police...

739
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,774
- Then what?
- The obvious.

740
01:03:33,775 --> 01:03:37,899
He seems to be a master at the game.

741
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:42,775
Get down quickly...
Careful.

742
01:03:43,816 --> 01:03:48,108
I'll play marbles with your eye-balls!

743
01:03:48,649 --> 01:03:52,316
- Put your hands up!
- They were always up there!

744
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:55,899
Come on... follow me!

745
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,690
Amar and Prem are here!

746
01:03:57,691 --> 01:04:03,191
But why are they walking with their hands up?

747
01:04:03,691 --> 01:04:06,232
The two clowns!

748
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:08,315
Careful!

749
01:04:08,316 --> 01:04:11,399
- Your apron, my Gogo.
- I'll pick it up!

750
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:18,192
Hi! Hello! How are you?
Hello there! Hi...

751
01:04:19,691 --> 01:04:23,149
Shut up! What are you greeting
them for? Are you at a party?

752
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:26,607
They have the diamonds, Gogo!

753
01:04:26,608 --> 01:04:30,691
- Hello, uncle!
- I'm not uncle. I'm Teja!

754
01:04:32,025 --> 01:04:35,192
But Teja has a mark on his face.
Right, Robert?

755
01:04:35,858 --> 01:04:38,899
- Yes. You must have the mark.
- What mark?

756
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:42,150
- Which mark is this?
- I'm Teja, my name is Teja too!

757
01:04:42,608 --> 01:04:45,649
I'm Teja, Ramu...
I am Teja!

758
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:47,899
You'd better listen, Ramu.
I'm Teja!

759
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,650
- I'm Teja!
- I am! I have the mark!

760
01:04:52,108 --> 01:04:55,900
- To hell with it! I'm Teja!
- I am, because...

761
01:04:56,274 --> 01:04:59,024
- Shut up!
- I'm Teja.

762
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:01,066
"What's this business of Teja, Teja?"

763
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:05,399
What I ask is where are the diamonds?

764
01:05:06,067 --> 01:05:10,900
How can we have the diamonds?
We're like innocent little birds.

765
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:15,025
Birds... of the same flock...
flying high in the skies...

766
01:05:15,733 --> 01:05:17,523
- Am I right, Prem?
- Why not.

767
01:05:17,524 --> 01:05:20,523
- We're kids.
- And very naive, too.

768
01:05:20,524 --> 01:05:22,732
- And clean-hearted, right?
- Why not?!

769
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:24,982
We only came here to free the girls.

770
01:05:24,983 --> 01:05:28,357
- Let's open them. Okay, Prem?
- Why not?

771
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:32,067
Don't act smart.

772
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:35,565
I'll use your eyes for marbles!

773
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:37,982
Why do you want to play with our eyes?

774
01:05:37,983 --> 01:05:42,315
They all have such big eyes.
Look at them!

775
01:05:42,316 --> 01:05:46,025
Don't let them con you!
They have the diamonds!

776
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,482
Robert snatched them away
from me and gave it to them!

777
01:05:50,483 --> 01:05:54,483
What silly logic!

778
01:05:54,858 --> 01:05:57,899
Why will his goons give the diamonds to me?

779
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,232
Can you do something silly
like that, Robert and Bhalla?

780
01:06:00,233 --> 01:06:02,857
Oh no, I'd never do that.
Never!

781
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:07,691
Actually, he's being misled by your face.

782
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:13,066
- What's wrong with my face?
- They think you're an idiot.

783
01:06:13,067 --> 01:06:17,942
He only looks like a foolish
fellow. But he's actually not!

784
01:06:18,775 --> 01:06:21,565
Was that praise for me or abuse?

785
01:06:21,566 --> 01:06:25,398
Praise!
It was praise all the way, sir!

786
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:28,732
I've been hearing tales about
you since I was a little boy.

787
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:32,108
Do you know what my mother
used to say when I cried, Prem?

788
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,649
What did your mother say?

789
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:38,565
She used to say...
"go to sleep son..."

790
01:06:38,566 --> 01:06:44,148
"or Gogo will be upon us"

791
01:06:44,149 --> 01:06:47,858
Did you hear that about
Crime Master Gogo's reputation?

792
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:52,108
When a kid doesn't sleep his
mother says, "sleep, dear..."

793
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:55,816
"or it'll bring Gogo here"

794
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:58,524
- Go on with some more.
- What's more...

795
01:06:58,525 --> 01:07:01,816
...I've even heard you're very
knowledgeable and all-knowing...

796
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:04,066
...a very accomplished person.

797
01:07:04,067 --> 01:07:08,316
You're strong, intelligent...
I'd even say you're not a man...

798
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:12,273
...you're a great soul!

799
01:07:12,274 --> 01:07:15,148
I think we should leave with
the girls now, Mr. Gogo.

800
01:07:15,149 --> 01:07:17,066
You will certainly extract the
diamonds from them, right?

801
01:07:17,067 --> 01:07:20,899
Go get a cab, Prem.

802
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,274
I'm knowledgeable and all-knowing...

803
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,857
- Give me a hand, sir.
- I'm strong...

804
01:07:26,858 --> 01:07:32,025
...intelligent. In fact,
I'm not a man at all!

805
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:37,233
Do you know what my mother taught me?

806
01:07:37,817 --> 01:07:39,941
- What did she say?
- She said...

807
01:07:39,942 --> 01:07:43,942
...always first take your money
and then deliver the goods.

808
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:47,565
I'll take the diamonds, first.
And then give the girls!

809
01:07:47,566 --> 01:07:50,774
Why are you pestering us, sir?
We're like innocent birds...

810
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,398
...we want to fly away.
Birds...

811
01:07:53,399 --> 01:07:59,525
- Look at this rifle!
- It's a revolver! Move it away!

812
01:08:06,274 --> 01:08:10,066
That's excellent, my boy!
Excellent!

813
01:08:11,066 --> 01:08:14,065
Now is when we have the bull by its horn!

814
01:08:14,066 --> 01:08:17,482
Don't move! Freeze!
Or I'll have you 'shaken' forever!

815
01:08:17,483 --> 01:08:19,774
Drop your guns!

816
01:08:19,775 --> 01:08:25,107
Not you, you idiot!
You'll have us killed!

817
01:08:25,108 --> 01:08:29,858
I could eat all of you alive, do you know that?!

818
01:08:33,942 --> 01:08:37,191
And you?!
You call yourself Crime Master, eh?

819
01:09:00,024 --> 01:09:05,233
"I made a mistake by oversight!"

820
01:09:18,108 --> 01:09:22,315
Shut up! I have a terrible temper!
I'm capable of doing anything!

821
01:09:22,316 --> 01:09:24,732
- Bullet...
- Yes, bullets!

822
01:09:24,733 --> 01:09:26,816
We'll put bullets in all of them!

823
01:09:26,817 --> 01:09:29,649
It's bullets that we don't have!

824
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:34,358
We've had it!

825
01:09:40,108 --> 01:09:44,024
Teja... Mr. Teja!
Please don't take offence, okay?

826
01:09:45,066 --> 01:09:48,524
Mr. Gogo...
The Great Crime Master Gogo!

827
01:09:48,525 --> 01:09:52,816
I was only kidding!

828
01:09:52,817 --> 01:09:56,065
I've been hearing tales of your
heroics from my childhood!

829
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:59,441
"Listen, ye people of the world,
Gogo's the Greatest of them all"

830
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,732
We're only children... very
naive... very good at heart...

831
01:10:05,733 --> 01:10:08,565
Pick up your guns, friends!

832
01:10:08,566 --> 01:10:11,858
We're innocent like birds... who fly in the sky!

833
01:10:12,566 --> 01:10:16,482
What should I do with this gun, Amar?

834
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:18,691
- There's no bullet, right?
- Haven't I said so?

835
01:10:18,692 --> 01:10:21,565
Then throw it away!

836
01:10:21,566 --> 01:10:26,316
I've had enough of your drama!
I'll kill everyone now!

837
01:10:28,233 --> 01:10:32,566
Tell me, what's your
last wish before you die?

838
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,608
Gogo, my friend...
Please let me have that loaded gun!

839
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:43,065
What's your last wish, buddy?

840
01:10:43,066 --> 01:10:47,066
Before I die,
I want to beat him up!

841
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:49,524
No! I don't want to get beaten up before I die!

842
01:10:49,525 --> 01:10:52,065
- Please let me beat him up!
- No...

843
01:10:52,066 --> 01:10:55,107
I give you both two minutes.

844
01:10:55,108 --> 01:11:01,483
Bash him up if you can.
And you, save yourself if possible!

845
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:17,232
Why did you say there was no bullet?!

846
01:11:17,233 --> 01:11:19,232
I made a mistake!
Forgive me!

847
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:24,399
- Mistake, eh?!
- No, not your knee!

848
01:11:28,233 --> 01:11:33,858
No... Not the chair!

849
01:11:49,775 --> 01:11:52,190
Well done, my boy!
Well done!

850
01:11:52,191 --> 01:11:55,567
Crime Master Gogo... I'll make
Band Master Toto out of you!

851
01:11:57,024 --> 01:12:01,566
Take their guns and throw them in the gutters!

852
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,899
Hand over your guns to the girls!
And do not act smart!

853
01:12:05,608 --> 01:12:09,233
Else, I'll fill this
Gogo's head with lead!

854
01:12:10,525 --> 01:12:14,482
And Gogo!
This revolver is not empty!

855
01:12:14,483 --> 01:12:20,108
Hey!
What are you up to?

856
01:12:25,358 --> 01:12:28,857
It had only one bullet!

857
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:34,691
Catch them!
Bash them up!

858
01:13:43,858 --> 01:13:49,274
They're all getting bashed up...
Let's slip out of here!

859
01:16:03,442 --> 01:16:08,191
Cut out the dramatics!

860
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:12,982
Come on, clowns!
Come to me with the diamonds...

861
01:16:12,983 --> 01:16:17,566
...else, I'll have dealt with these girls!

862
01:16:17,567 --> 01:16:23,108
Okay...
Give them to me.

863
01:16:24,525 --> 01:16:26,899
Hurry up!

864
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,525
How much must these diamonds cost?
At least a crore, right?

865
01:16:30,858 --> 01:16:33,983
A crore?! Each of these
diamonds is worth a crore!

866
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:37,899
Each of them, worth a crore?!

867
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:41,732
Yes!
It's the earning of his whole life!

868
01:16:41,733 --> 01:16:44,482
Take one last look at them, uncle.

869
01:16:44,483 --> 01:16:46,732
What are you showing it to him for?
Come here!

870
01:16:46,733 --> 01:16:51,191
Do you mean that if each of
these guys gets a diamond...

871
01:16:51,733 --> 01:16:53,732
...their lives will be made, right?

872
01:16:53,733 --> 01:16:57,441
Their lives?!
Lives for generations to come!

873
01:16:57,442 --> 01:17:01,815
Be quick, or I'll kill them!

874
01:17:01,816 --> 01:17:04,732
Please don't...
Here we come.

875
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:06,899
You too must take a look, Gogo.

876
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,232
This will be an addition to your folklore.

877
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:11,274
Of passing by a terrific opportunity.

878
01:17:11,275 --> 01:17:13,690
- Don't touch it!
- Just one diamond!

879
01:17:13,691 --> 01:17:16,815
I've given Teja a loan!
Give me one in exchange!

880
01:17:16,816 --> 01:17:18,899
Come right here, or I'll kill them!

881
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,607
- Careful!
- Yes, I'm taking care...

882
01:17:21,608 --> 01:17:26,983
Careful!
Don't drop it!

883
01:17:44,025 --> 01:17:46,316
Raveena's mother in Heaven...

884
01:17:46,317 --> 01:17:51,733
...I'm coming to join you!

885
01:17:54,192 --> 01:17:59,650
Give one to
Crime Master Gogo!

886
01:18:02,108 --> 01:18:05,648
They've taken everything away!

887
01:18:05,649 --> 01:18:07,982
There's one of them...
Catch him!

888
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:14,149
He hit me!
Everybody's hitting me!

889
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:19,065
What's happened to Daddy?

890
01:18:19,066 --> 01:18:21,441
What's happened, father?

891
01:18:21,442 --> 01:18:26,192
Uncle, wake up! We've
risked our lives to save you!

892
01:18:26,733 --> 01:18:28,899
Saved me, my foot!

893
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,274
Those people have taken
away my life's savings!

894
01:18:31,275 --> 01:18:34,816
How can they take it away,
with both of us around, uncle?

895
01:18:35,441 --> 01:18:38,815
Get out the real diamonds, Prem!

896
01:18:38,816 --> 01:18:42,025
- We threw away the real ones, Amar!
- What are you saying?

897
01:18:43,566 --> 01:18:46,191
Give me the bag in which
we had kept the fake ones.

898
01:18:46,192 --> 01:18:51,066
No, you idiot! The real
ones were in the red bag!

899
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:54,941
Oh no!

900
01:18:56,275 --> 01:18:59,149
Yes, I remember now!
They were in this bag!

901
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:02,065
In the red bag, right?
Must be these, then!

902
01:19:02,066 --> 01:19:07,108
I always knew my darling
daughters would choose real gems!

903
01:19:07,649 --> 01:19:11,983
"Listen to this tale,
O people of the world..."

904
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:18,191
"...the name of Gogo!"

905
01:19:20,733 --> 01:19:23,066
Whoever you are...

906
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:25,732
...will you win the game
in which I deal the cards?

907
01:19:25,733 --> 01:19:27,774
Give me the diamonds!

908
01:19:27,775 --> 01:19:31,565
There goes another opportunity!

909
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:35,858
Give me the diamonds, as per our plan.

910
01:19:37,067 --> 01:19:40,648
Yes, I'm Bhalla!
Pass the diamonds, good fella!

911
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:45,816
Pass the diamonds here.
I won't make any mistake this time.

912
01:19:46,691 --> 01:19:51,733
My life is made now!

913
01:19:52,192 --> 01:19:56,692
Not a soul will move!

914
01:20:00,775 --> 01:20:03,774
I made the mistake again!

915
01:20:03,775 --> 01:20:07,482
Join the queue!
Take them to the prison in a queue!

916
01:20:07,483 --> 01:20:11,398
They're already in a queue!

917
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:17,024
Let me see...
Teja, caught at last, eh?

918
01:20:17,025 --> 01:20:20,523
And who are you?
Oh! Gogo!

919
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:24,483
At least get me back the
money I had loaned him!

920
01:20:25,025 --> 01:20:27,316
You'll get it in prison.

921
01:20:27,317 --> 01:20:31,899
Here are your diamonds, Mr. Ramgopal.

922
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:35,565
Don't thank me...
Thank Amar and Prem...

923
01:20:35,566 --> 01:20:40,692
...It was they who rang me up.

924
01:20:42,524 --> 01:20:46,066
- About our marriage?
- Why not?

925
01:20:46,067 --> 01:20:47,565
For getting the diamonds back...

926
01:20:47,566 --> 01:20:51,149
I'll get my daughters married to Amar and Prem.

927
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:54,441
Uncle you're great!
Magnanimous...

928
01:20:55,316 --> 01:20:58,900
...wise...
In fact, you're not man at all!

929
01:20:59,399 --> 01:21:04,483
You're a Great Soul!
