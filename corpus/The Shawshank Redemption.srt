<font color=#FF551>DA:</font> Mr. Dufresne,

19
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:11,151
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

20
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,611
It was very bitter.

21
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:22,812
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

22
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,279
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,398
What was your response?

24
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,441
I told her I would not grant one.

25
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,770
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

26
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:38,620
Those were the words you used,
Mr. Dufresne , according to your neighbors.

27
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:43,416
If they say so. I really don't
remember. I was upset.

28
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,849
What happened after you
argued with your wife?

29
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,748
She packed a bag.

30
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:54,006
She packed a bag to go
and stay with... Mr. Quentin.

31
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,383
<font color=#FF551>DA:</font> Glenn Quentin.

32
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:58,852
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

33
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:01,811
The man you discovered
was your wife's lover.

34
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,939
Did you follow her?

35
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,062
I went to a few bars first.

36
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,324
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

37
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,694
They weren't home, so
I... parked in the turnout,

38
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,362
and waited.

39
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,056
<font color=#FF551>DA:</font> With what intention?

40
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,533
<font color=#FF551>DUFRESNE:</font> I'm not sure.

41
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,827
I was confused.

42
00:03:24,028 --> 00:03:25,575
Drunk.

43
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,334
I think... mostly, I wanted to scare them.

44
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,570
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

45
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:36,240
No. I was sobering up.

46
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:39,676
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

47
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:43,322
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

48
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,515
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

49
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:49,894
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

50
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:55,047
and finds your wife in bed with her
lover, riddled with .38 caliber bullets.

51
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,447
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

52
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,366
<font color=#ff00ff>[Whispers]</font> Yes, it does.

53
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:07,638
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

54
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:11,917
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

55
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:17,014
<font color=#FF551>DA:</font> The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found.

56
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:19,892
So, there could be no comparison
made between your gun

57
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:24,643
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

58
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:32,484
And that also... is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

59
00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:35,849
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

60
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,616
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

66

We have the accused at

67
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:05,712
We have footprints, tire tracks,

68
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:10,341
bullets strewn on the ground which bear
his fingerprints, a broken bourbon bottle,

69
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:11,852
likewise with fingerprints.

70
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:13,603
And most of all,

71
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:16,381
we have a beautiful young
woman and her lover

72
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,446
lying dead in each other's arms.

73
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,984
They... had sinned.

74
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:28,915
But was their crime so great
as to merit a death sentence?

75
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,668
Now, while you think about that...

76
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,084
...think about this.

77
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,211
A revolver holds six bullets.

78
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,671
Not eight.

79
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,216
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

80
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,345
That atleast could be
understood, if not condoned.

81
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,056
No. This was revenge...

82
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:53,943
of a much more brutal and
cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

83
00:05:53,944 --> 00:05:56,271
Four bullets per victim.

84
00:05:56,872 --> 00:06:02,736
Not six shots fired, but eight.
That means that he fired the gun empty,

85
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,810
and then stopped to reload...

86
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,584
...so that he could shoot each of them again.

87
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:11,453
An extra bullet per lover.

88
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,580
Right in the head.

90
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:22,547

20 years of a life sentence.

Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

101
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,985
I mean, I learned my lesson.

102

I can honestly say... I'm a changed man.

103
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,074
I'm no longer a danger to society.

104

121
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,579
and asked me to smuggle Rita
Hayworth into the prison for him,

122
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,045
I told him, "No problem."

123
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,726
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

124
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,038
in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

125
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,318
On the outside he had been
vice-president of a large Portland bank.

167
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,476
Rule number one:

168
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,437
No blasphemy.

169
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,065
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

170
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,525
The other rules...

171
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,319
you'll figure out as you go along.

172
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,095
Any questions?

173
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,985
When do we eat?

174
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,664
<font color=#FF551>HADLEY:</font> You eat when we say you eat!

175
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:50,028
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

176
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,589
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

177
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,165
Aarghh!

178
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:56,009
On your feet.

179
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,886
<font color=#FF551>NORTON:</font> I believe in two things.

180
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,447
Discipline and the Bible.

181
00:14:01,248 --> 00:14:03,262
Here you'll receive both.

182
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,119
Put your trust in the Lord.

183
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,976
Your ass belongs to me.

184
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,147
Welcome to Shawshank.

185
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,695
Unhook 'em.

186
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,127
Turn around.

187
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,490
That's enough.

188
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,526
Move to the end of the cage.

189
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,586
Turn around.

190
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,217
Delouse him.

191
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,303
Turn around.

192
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,762
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

193
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,686
Next man up.

194
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,686
To the right. Right, right, right.

195
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,313
Left, left...

196
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,167
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

197
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,778
They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,

198
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,949
skin burning and half-blind from that
delousing shit they throw on you.

199
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,794
And when they put you in that cell,

200
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,547
and those bars slam home...

201
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,383
that's when you know it's for real.

202
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,703
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

203
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:26,387
Nothing left, but all the time
in the world to think about it.

204
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,895
Most new fish come close
to madness the first night.

205
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:34,474
Somebody always breaks down crying.

206
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,818
Happens every time.

207
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,987
The only question is:

208
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,985
Who's it gonna be?

209
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,655
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

210
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,659
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

211
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,624

Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

218
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:39,122
- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?

219
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,541
You'll wish your daddy
never dicked your mommy.

220

Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

221

You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!

222
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,220
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.

Fat Ass.

228
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,161
Talk to me, boy.

229
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,156
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

230
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,159
Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?

231
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,127
This place ain't so bad.

00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,034
I tell you what.

00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,375
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

234
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,345
I know a couple of big old bull queers

333
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,008
<font color=#ff00ff>[Laughs]</font> You're gonna fit right in!

334
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,961
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

335
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:17,077
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

336
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,395
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

337
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:26,232
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

338
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,651
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

339
00:25:29,752 --> 00:25:32,321
I haven't made up my mind. <font color=#ff00ff>[Chuckles]</font>

340
00:25:32,522 --> 00:25:35,392
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

341
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,579
I'm known to locate certain
things, from time to time.

342
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,665
- I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.        - A what?

343
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,625
A rock hammer.

344
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,299
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

345
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,857
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I would'nt
a question, I'd just quote a price,

346
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:54,523
but then a toothbrush is
a non-lethal object, is'nt it?

347
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,955
Fair enough.

348
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,299
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

349
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,818
- Looks like a miniature pickaxe.
- Pickaxe?

350
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:04,984
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

351
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,924
Quartz?

352
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:10,373
Quartz.

353
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,005
And some mica.

354
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,953
Shale.

355
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,125
Limestone.

356
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,227
So?

357
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,996
So, I'm a rock hound.

358
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,891
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

359
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:28,502
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

360
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:29,841
No, sir.

361
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,256
I have no enemies here.

362
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,013
No? Wait a while.

363
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,529
Word gets around.

364
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,740
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

365
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,814
Especially Bogs.

366
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,814
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

367
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,399
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Neither are they.

368
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,490
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

369
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:02,495
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

370
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,207
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

371
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,125
Thanks for the advice.

372
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,493
Well, that's free.

373
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,629
You understand my concern.

374
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,457
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer, ok?

375
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:19,349
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

376
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,306
Did I miss something? What's funny?

377
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,231
You'll understand when
you see the rock hammer.

378
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:31,941
- What's an item like this usually go for?
- Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

379
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,652
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

380
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,280
But this is a specialty item.

381
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,865
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

382
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,409
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

383
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,465
Ten it is.

384
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,173
Waste of money, if you ask me.

385
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:48,796
Why's that?

386
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,425
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

387
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,708
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

388
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,518
If they do catch you with it,
you don't know me.

389
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,312
You mention my name, we
never do business again.

390
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:05,020
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

391
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,643
I understand.

392
00:28:09,144 --> 00:28:09,561
Thank you...

393
00:28:10,562 --> 00:28:11,671
Mr. er...?

394
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:14,858
- Red. The name's Red.
- Red?

395
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:17,591
Why do they call you that?

396
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,247
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

397
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,461
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> I could see why some of
the boys took him for snobby.

398
00:28:35,262 --> 00:28:37,465
He had a quiet way about him.

399
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:42,111
A walk and a talk, that just
wasn't normal around here.

400
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,638
He strolled...

401
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,059
like a man in a park, without
a care or worry in the world.

402
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,055
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

403
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:57,526
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

404
00:28:57,727 --> 00:28:59,491
I liked Andy from the start.

405
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:04,955
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

406
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:10,835
Move it! Come on. Move it!

407
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,092
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

408
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,773
Easy.

409
00:29:28,374 --> 00:29:29,938
Keep it moving.

410
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:34,484
Red...

411
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,621
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Andy was right. I finally got the joke.

412
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:03,805
It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

413
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,229
- Book?
- Not today.

414
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,153
- Book?
- No.

415
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,656
Hey, Brooksy.

416
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,037
Delivery for Dufresne.

417
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:39,458
Book?... book?

418
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,791
Dufresne...

419
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,940
Here's your book.

420
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,730
Thanks.

421
00:30:57,688 --> 00:31:02,047
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

422
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:41,315
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

423
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,447
Honey... hush.

424
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,415
<font color=#ff00ff>[Groans]</font>

425
00:31:56,522 --> 00:31:58,624
That's it. You fight.

426
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,292
It's better that way.

427
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,465
<font color=#ff00ff>[Screaming and yelling]</font>

428
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,653
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,

429
00:32:11,654 --> 00:32:13,681
and the Sisters let him be.

430
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,165
I wish I could tell you that.

431
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,732
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

432
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,022
He never said who did it.

433
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,351
But we all knew.

434
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,907
<font color=#ff00ff>[Gate buzzer]</font>

435
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,365
Things went on like that for a while.

436
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,576
Prison life consists of routine...

437
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,667
and then more routine.

438
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,681
Every so often, Andy would
show up with fresh bruises.

439
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,796
The Sisters kept at him.

440
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,909
Sometimes he was able to
fight 'em off. Sometimes not.

441
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,345
And that's how it went for Andy.

442
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,973
That was his routine.

443
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,052
I do believe those first two
years were the worst for him.

444
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,728
And I also believe,

445
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:06,417
if things had gone on that way, this
place would have got the best of him.

446
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:12,447
But then, in the spring of 1949,
the powers that be decided that...

447
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,451
The roof of the license-plate
factory needs resurfacing.

448
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:19,084
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

449
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,282
As you know,

450
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:25,377
special detail carries with it special privileges.

451
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,243
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> It was outdoor detail...

452
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:32,835
...and May is one damn fine
month to be working outdoors.

453
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,545
Stay in line there.

454
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,644
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

455
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,314
<font color=#ff00ff>[Whispers]</font>

456
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,818

00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,750
Ellis Redding.

458
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,769
Wouldn't you know it?

459
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,539
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

460
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,907
<font color=#FF551>GUARD:</font> Andrew Dufresne.

461
00:33:56,408 --> 00:33:58,936
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> It only cost us a pack
of smokes per man.

462
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,330
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

463
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,901
<font color=#FF551>HADLEY:</font> So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

464
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,294
I say, "Yeah?"

465
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,390
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

466
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,935
- Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.
- I'm not. He was an asshole.

467
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:18,055
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

468
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,100
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

469
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:27,039
- Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.
<font color=#FF551>- GUARD:</font> A million bucks?

470
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,980
Fucking incredible how
lucky some assholes get.

471
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:32,127
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

472
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,397
35,000. That's what he left me.

473
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:37,199
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

474
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,411
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

475
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,004
Isn't it?

476
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:45,032
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

477
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,176
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

478
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:52,530
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

479
00:34:52,531 --> 00:34:54,083
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Crying shame.

480
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,135
Some people really got it awful!

481
00:34:56,736 --> 00:35:00,488
Andy, are you nuts?
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

482
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:03,517
<font color=#FF551>GUARD:</font> Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

483
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,636
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

484
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,397
I've got to pay tax on the car.

485
00:35:08,498 --> 00:35:12,859
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids pestering
me to take them for a ride all the time...

486
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,863
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

487
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,816
I tell you... Uncle Sam!

488
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,953
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

489
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,747
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

490
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,166
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

Mr. Hadley...

494
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,465
do you trust your wife?

495
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,264
Oh, that's funny.

496
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:45,725
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

497
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,567
I mean, do you think she'd go behind
your back, try to hamstring you?

498
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,917
That's it. Step aside, Mert.
This fucker's having an accident.

499
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,068
He's gonna push him off the roof.

500
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,581
Cos if you do trust her, there's
no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

501
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:01,241
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

502
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,351
- 35,000?
- All of it.

503
00:36:03,352 --> 00:36:05,170
- All of it?
- Every penny.

504
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:07,289
You'd better start making sense.

505
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,708
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

506
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:14,120
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

507
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:18,217
- Bullshit! Tax-free?
- Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

508
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,386
You're the smart banker what
killed his wife, aren't you.

509
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:23,815
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?

510
00:36:23,816 --> 00:36:26,600
- So I can end up in here with you?
- It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS.

511
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,795
They'll say the same thing.
Actually I feel stupid telling you this.

512
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,872
I'm sure you would have
investigated the on matter yourself.

513
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:36,043
Yeah, I don't need no smart banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

514
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,771
Of course not, but you do need
someone to set up the tax-free gift for you.

515
00:36:39,772 --> 00:36:43,550
- It'll cost you. A lawyer, for example.
- A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

516
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:44,450
Alright.

517
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:47,587
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

518
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:51,905
If you get the forms, I'll prepare
them for you. Nearly free of charge.

519
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,871
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

520
00:36:57,272 --> 00:36:59,974
<font color=#FF551>GUARD:</font>
Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

521
00:36:59,975 --> 00:37:02,619
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man,...

522
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,979
if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion... sir.

523
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,730
What are you jimmies staring at?
Back to work!

524
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,070
<font color=#FF551>GUARD:</font> Let's go. Work.

525
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:29,263
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

526
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:34,417
the convict crew that tarred the
plate-factory roof in the spring of '49...

527
00:37:34,718 --> 00:37:37,712
wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,

528
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:41,675
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

529
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:46,972
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

530
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:49,437
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

531
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,984
The colossal prick even
managed to sound magnanimous.

532
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:00,669
We sat and drank with the sun on
our shoulders, and felt like free men.

533
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,556
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.

534
00:38:04,757 --> 00:38:07,734
We were the lords of all creation.

535
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:12,664
As for Andy, he spent that
break hunkered in the shade...

536
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:15,458
a strange little smile on his face,

537
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,924
watching us drink his beer.

538
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,327
Hey...

539
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,304
Want a cold one, Andy?

540
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,055
No, thanks.

541
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,729
I gave up drinking.

542
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:38,239
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> You could argue he'd done
it to curry favor with the guards.

543
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,955
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

544
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,869
Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again.

545
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,039
If only for a short while.

546
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,556
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> King me.

547
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:58,259
- Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.
- What?

548
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,486
Civilized, strategic.

549
00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:02,505
And a total fucking mystery.

550
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,798
I hate it.

551
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:05,890
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

552
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:08,345
<font color=#ff00ff>[Chuckles]</font> Yeah. Sure.

553
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,855
I thought of getting a board together.

554
00:39:10,856 --> 00:39:13,933
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

555
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:18,096
We might do business on a board.
but I want to carve the pieces myself.

556
00:39:18,097 --> 00:39:21,865
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

557
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:24,768
- I think it'll take years.
- Well, years I got.

558
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:26,437
What I don't have are the rocks.

559
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:28,590
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

560
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:30,630
Pebbles, mostly.

561
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:37,749
Andy, we're getting to be
kinda friends, aren't we?

562
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,097
Yeah, I guess.

563
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:41,946
Can I ask you something?

564
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:45,228
Why did you do it?

565
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:50,216
I'm innocent, Red. Just
like everybody else here.

566
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:55,998
What are you in for?

567
00:39:58,821 --> 00:40:01,106
Murder. Same as you.

568
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:02,353
Innocent?

569
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:07,308
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

570
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,773

571
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,507
<i>How did you know?</i>

572
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:10,758
<i>How did I know what?</i>

573
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,558
<i>So, you don't know? Come.</i>

574
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,141

00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,319

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

581
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:39,579
Here she comes.

582
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,640
This is the part I like... when
she does that shit with her hair.

583
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:45,043
Yeah, I know. I've seen
it three times this month.

589
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:07,148
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

590
00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:09,234
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

591
00:42:10,135 --> 00:42:11,249
Can you get her?

592
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,699
<i>So, this is Johnny Farrell. I've heard
a lot about you, Johnny Farrell.</i>

593
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,369
- Take a few weeks.
- Weeks?

594
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,807
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't have her stuffed
down the front of my pants right now,...

595
00:42:22,808 --> 00:42:23,714
I'm sorry to say.

596
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,590
But I'll get her. Relax.

597
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,747

608
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,801
He broke my fuckin' nose!

609
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:26,161
Now... I'm gonna open my fly...

610
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,902
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

611
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,883
When you're gonna swallow mein
then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

612
00:43:32,884 --> 00:43:35,803
You broke his nose, he ought
to have something to show for it.

613
00:43:35,804 --> 00:43:37,997
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

614
00:43:37,998 --> 00:43:40,533
No. You don't understand.

615

You do that, and I'll put all eight
inches of this steel in your ear.

616
00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:44,996
All right.

617
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,151
But you should know that sudden,
serious brain injury causes...

618
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:50,406
...the victim to bite down hard.

619
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,379
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

620
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,556
they have to pry the victim's
jaws open... with a crowbar.

621
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,522
Where did you get this shit?

622
00:44:03,023 --> 00:44:04,170
I read it.

623
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,733

00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,625
What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.

630

Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

631
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:33,382
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,762
...and Bogs never walked again.

648
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,412
They transferred him to
a minimum-security hospital upstate.

649
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:54,109
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of
his days drinking his food through a straw.

650
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,761
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

651
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:05,182
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

- No, horse shit. Petrified.

661
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,820
<font color=#ff00ff>[Horse whinnies]</font>

662
00:47:12,254 --> 00:47:14,914
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
<font color=#ff00ff>- [Men laugh]</font>

663
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,658
Oh, damn!

664
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:21,100
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

665
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:27,369
And by the weekend he was due back, we had
enough rocks to keep him busy till rapture.

666
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,563
I also got a big shipment in that week.

667
00:47:30,964 --> 00:47:33,391
Cigarettes. Chewing gum.

668
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:34,776
Sipping whisky.

669
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:38,604
Playing cards with naked
ladies on them. You name it.

670
00:47:39,005 --> 00:47:41,946
And of course, the most important item.

671
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,683
Rita Hayworth herself.

672
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:22,481
<font color=#FF551>GUARD:</font> OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

673
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,901
<font color=#ff00ff>[Furtively]</font> Heads up.
They're tossing the cells.

674
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,533
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

675
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,737
119.

676
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,907
123.

677
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,876
<font color=#ff00ff>[Guards calling out]</font>

678
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,151
On your feet.

679
00:48:48,382 --> 00:48:49,338
Face the wall.

680
00:49:23,852 --> 00:49:25,816
<font color=#FF551>HADLEY:</font> Turn around and face the Warden.

681
00:49:32,551 --> 00:49:34,216
Pleased to see you reading this.

682
00:49:35,513 --> 00:49:37,286
Any favorite passages?

683
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:43,859
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

684
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,783
Mark 13:35.

685
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,236
I always liked that one.

686
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,821
But I prefer...

687
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,157
"I'm the light of the world.

688
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:58,435
He that followeth me shall not walk in
darkness, but shall have the light of life."

689
00:49:58,436 --> 00:50:00,555
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

690
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,597
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

691
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,608
A man should have a skill.

692
00:50:10,115 --> 00:50:11,553
Wanna explain this?

693
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,800
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

694
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,903
A little hobby of mine.

695
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,567
<font color=#ff00ff>[Inhales]</font>

696
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:34,419
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

697
00:50:38,777 --> 00:50:40,441
I can't say I approve of this.

698
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,053
But I suppose...

699
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,090
...exceptions can be made.

700
00:50:58,296 --> 00:50:59,769
<font color=#FF551>HADLEY:</font> Lock 'em up!

701
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,735
I almost forgot.

702
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,171
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

703
00:51:07,172 --> 00:51:09,110
Salvation lies within.

704
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:10,829
Yes, sir.

705
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,715
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Tossing cells was just an excuse.

706
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:26,044
The truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.

707
00:51:39,804 --> 00:51:41,911
My wife made that in church group.

708
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,282
Very nice, sir.

709
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,526
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

710
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,566
No, sir, not especially.

711
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:54,944
Perhaps we can find something more...

712
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,910
befitting a man of your education.

713
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,124
<font color=#ff00ff>[Bird screeches]</font>

714
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,623
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

715
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:08,999
Andy.

716
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,673
I thought I heard you out here!

717
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,463
I've been reassigned to you.

718
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:17,716
I know. They told me. <font color=#ff00ff>[Chuckles]</font>

719
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:19,585
Ain't that a kick in the head?

720
00:52:20,186 --> 00:52:22,371
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

721
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:23,340
Come on.

722
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,692
Well, here she is.

723
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,920
Shawshank Prison library.

724
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,581
National Geographics.

725
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,401
Reader's Digest condensed books.

726
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,295
Louis L'Amour.

727
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,505
Look Magazine.

728
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,091
Erle Stanley Gardners.

729
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,636
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

730
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:48,790
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

731
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:55,880
- Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?
- Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

732
00:52:56,281 --> 00:53:01,635
Oh... I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

733
00:53:02,536 --> 00:53:04,797
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

734
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:07,565
No. No, not much to it, really.

735
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:10,753
- Well, why me? Why now?
- I don't know,

736
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:14,390
but it'll be nice to have some
company down here for a change.

737
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,955
<font color=#FF551>HADLEY:</font> Dufresne!

738
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,641
That's him. That's the one.

739
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,587
I'm Dekins.

740
00:53:36,988 --> 00:53:38,731
<font color=#ff00ff>[Nervously]</font> I was er...

741
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:43,515
thinking about maybe setting up some
kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

742
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,714
Oh...

743
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,562
I see.

744
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:51,699
Well, erm...

745
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,487
...why don't we have a seat, and talk it over?

746
00:53:59,453 --> 00:54:02,551
Brooks, do you have
a piece of paper and a pencil?

747
00:54:13,942 --> 00:54:15,134
Thanks.

748
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:17,483
So...

749
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,440
Mr. Dekins...

750
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:25,886
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

751
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,097
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

752
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,849
As God is my witness, he did!

753
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,511
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

754
00:54:34,512 --> 00:54:36,772
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

755
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,731
My ass!

756
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,024
Shook his hand.

757
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:42,569
Hell, I... I near soiled myself! <font color=#ff00ff>[Laughs]</font>

758
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:46,865
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

759
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,410
and he would have been:
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

760
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,541
Making a few friends, Andy?

761
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,248
I wouldn't say "friends".

762
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:58,135
I'm a convicted murderer who
provides sound financial planning.

763
00:54:58,136 --> 00:55:00,254
It's a wonderful pet to have.

764
00:55:00,955 --> 00:55:05,050
- Got you out of the laundry, though.
- Well, it might do more than that.

765
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:08,137
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

766
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,931
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

767
00:55:11,832 --> 00:55:14,375
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

768
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:18,814
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

769
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,649
Ask the Warden for funds.

770
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,984
<font color=#ff00ff>[Laughter]</font>

771
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,762
Son, son, son. Six wardens have
been through here in my tenure,

772
00:55:25,763 --> 00:55:28,474
and I've learned one
immutable, universal truth.

773
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:30,384
Not one of them born...

774
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,327
whose asshole wouldn't pucker
up tighter than a snare...

775
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:34,931
...drum when you asked them for funds.

776
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:39,043
- The budget's stretched thin, as it is.
- I see.

777
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:43,172
Perhaps I could write to the State
Senate and request funds from them.

778
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:45,255
As far as they're concerned,
there's only three ways to spend...

779
00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:47,434
...tax paying hard than money
when it comes to prisons.

780
00:55:47,835 --> 00:55:49,903
more walls, more bars and more guards.

781
00:55:49,904 --> 00:55:54,608
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. A
letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

782
00:55:54,609 --> 00:55:55,434
Sure can.

783
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:58,396
But you write your letters,
if it makes you happy.

784
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,570
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

785
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:08,002
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> So, Andy started writing
a letter a week,... just like he said.

786
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:16,877
And, just like Norton said,
Andy got no answers.

787
00:56:24,539 --> 00:56:29,427
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

788
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:33,097
The year after that, he did them all...

789
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,062
including the Warden's.

790
00:56:37,259 --> 00:56:40,396
The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season

791
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,861
to coincide with tax season.

792
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:49,071
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

793
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:53,383
So, Moresby Prison issued you
your gun, but you had to pay for it?

794
00:56:53,384 --> 00:56:55,119
Damn right. The holster, too.

795
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,704
That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.

796
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:01,125
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Yes, sir. Andy was a
regular cottage industry.

797
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:04,253
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

798
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,180
he was allowed a staff.

799
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:08,924
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

800
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,677
It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,

801
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,830
and that was fine by me.

802
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:18,188
And still... he kept sending those letters.

803
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,023
Red,... Andy.

804
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,316
It's Brooks.

805
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,361
<font color=#ff00ff>- [Men shouting]</font>
- Watch the door.

806
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,929
- Please, Brooks.
- Just calm the fuck down.

807
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:32,614
Stay back!

808
00:57:33,015 --> 00:57:34,841
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

809
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:37,911
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

810
00:57:38,212 --> 00:57:40,456
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

811
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,666
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

812
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,460
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

813
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,420
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

814
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,030
It's what they done!

815
00:57:48,931 --> 00:57:50,332
I... I got no choice...

816
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:53,285
You're not gonna hurt Heywood.
we all know even Heywood knows that.

817
00:57:53,286 --> 00:57:55,496
- Right, Heywood?
- I... I know that, sure.

818
00:57:55,497 --> 00:57:59,199
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend of
yours and Brooks has been a reasonable man.

819
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,476
That's right. That's right, guys?

820
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:04,137
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

821
00:58:04,138 --> 00:58:05,852
Put the knife down.

822
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:07,808
Brooks...

823
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:10,044
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

824
00:58:11,345 --> 00:58:12,863
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

825
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,114
<font color=#ff00ff>[Heywood gasps]</font>

826
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,282
It's the only...

827

828
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,746
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this, come on.

829
00:58:21,147 --> 00:58:22,711

<font color=#FF551>HEYWOOD:</font> Him?

833
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:40,624

834
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,935

you've had worse from shaving.

835
00:58:43,236 --> 00:58:44,870
What the hell did you
do to set him off, anyway?

836
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:47,689
I do nothing. I come in
here to say fare-thee-well.

837
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:50,697
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

838
00:58:53,262 --> 00:58:55,973
I just don't understand what
happened in there. That's all.

839
00:58:55,974 --> 00:58:58,942
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

840
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:01,036
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

841
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:04,222
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

842
00:59:04,223 --> 00:59:05,582
Would you knock it off?

843
00:59:06,483 --> 00:59:08,001
Brooks ain't no bug.

844
00:59:08,502 --> 00:59:09,458
He's just...

845
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,970
He's just institutionalized.

846
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,177
Institutionalized, my ass.

847
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:21,056
The man's been in here
50 years, Heywood. 50 years.

848
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,549
This is all he knows.

849
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,352
In here, he's an important man.

850
00:59:25,693 --> 00:59:26,895
He's an educated man.

851
00:59:27,696 --> 00:59:29,361
Outside, he's nothing.

852
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:33,360
Just a used-up con with
arthritis in both hands.

853
00:59:34,061 --> 00:59:36,655
Probably couldn't get
a library card if he tried.

854
00:59:37,256 --> 00:59:38,824
You know what I'm trying to say?

855
00:59:39,525 --> 00:59:42,257
Red, I do believe you're
talking out of your ass.

856

You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

857
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,672
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

858
00:59:50,411 --> 00:59:51,976
First you hate 'em...

859
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,804
...then you get used to 'em.

860
00:59:57,752 --> 00:59:59,762
Enough time passes...

861
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:02,607
you get so you depend on 'em.

862
01:00:03,408 --> 01:00:05,526
That's institutionalized.

863
01:00:06,027 --> 01:00:07,102
<font color=#FF551>JIGGER:</font> Shit.

864
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,812
You can never get like that.

865
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,314
Oh, yeah?

866
01:00:11,015 --> 01:00:13,483
Say that when you've been
here as long as Brooks has.

867
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,240
Goddamn right.

868
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,624
They send you here for life.

869
01:00:20,675 --> 01:00:22,789
That's exactly what they take.

870
01:00:24,529 --> 01:00:26,293

873
01:00:38,209 --> 01:00:39,723
You go on, now.

874
01:00:41,128 --> 01:00:42,479

875
01:00:44,028 --> 01:00:44,979

Watch it, old-timer! Are
you trying to get killed?

882
01:01:55,402 --> 01:01:58,921
I saw an automobile once,
when I was a kid, but...

883
01:01:59,522 --> 01:02:01,721
now... they're everywhere.

884
01:02:05,454 --> 01:02:09,320
The world went and got
itself in a big damn hurry.

885
01:02:25,991 --> 01:02:31,771
The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,

886
01:02:31,772 --> 01:02:35,747
and a job, bagging groceries at the Foodway.

887
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:42,832
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.

Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

895
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:09,034
I keep thinking... Jake might
just show up and say hello.

896
01:03:09,335 --> 01:03:11,207
But he never does.

897
01:03:12,613 --> 01:03:17,672
And I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.

898
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,799
I have trouble sleeping at night.

899
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,973
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

900
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:29,979
I wake up, scared.

901
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:34,163
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

902
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:41,256
Maybe I should get me a gun and rob
the Foodway, so they'd send me home.

903
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,535
I could shoot the manager, while I was at it.

904
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:45,575
Sort of like a bonus.

905
01:03:47,097 --> 01:03:51,034
I guess I'm too old for that
sort of nonsense any more.

906
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:53,161
I don't like it here.

907
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,914
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

908
01:03:56,315 --> 01:03:57,382
I've decided...

909
01:03:57,983 --> 01:03:59,339
not to stay.

I like to think they were singing
about something so beautiful,...

958

...it can't be expressed in words,... and
makes your heart ache because of it.

higher and farther than anybody
in a grey place dares to dream.

961
01:09:51,762 --> 01:09:55,203
It was like some beautiful bird
flapped into our drab little cage

01:11:55,986 --> 01:11:57,403
Didn't make much sense in here.

995
01:11:57,904 --> 01:11:59,548
Here's where it makes the most sense.

996
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,417
You need it, so you don't forget.

997
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:04,035
Forget?

998
01:12:04,536 --> 01:12:06,079
Forget that...

999
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:08,544
there are places...

1000
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,854
...in the world that aren't made
out of stone... that there's a...

1001
01:12:14,755 --> 01:12:16,172
there's something...

1002
01:12:16,573 --> 01:12:19,850
inside that,... they can't get to... that...

1003
01:12:20,191 --> 01:12:21,527
they can't touch.

1004
01:12:22,328 --> 01:12:23,684
It's yours.

1005
01:12:25,123 --> 01:12:26,312
What are you talking about?

1006
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,185
Hope.

1007
01:12:29,986 --> 01:12:31,042
Hope?

1008
01:12:33,398 --> 01:12:34,950
Let me tell you something, my friend.

1009
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:37,990
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1010
01:12:39,496 --> 01:12:41,619
Hope can drive a man insane.

1011
01:12:42,783 --> 01:12:44,284
It's got no use on the inside.

1012
01:12:44,885 --> 01:12:46,933
You'd better get used to that idea.

1013
01:12:49,673 --> 01:12:51,379
Like Brooks did?

1014
01:13:16,733 --> 01:13:17,655
Sit down.

1015
01:13:22,989 --> 01:13:26,034
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

1016
01:13:27,435 --> 01:13:29,245
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1017
01:13:29,746 --> 01:13:30,830
Oh, yes, sir.

1018
01:13:32,231 --> 01:13:33,296
Without a doubt.

1019
01:13:34,559 --> 01:13:36,674
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1020
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:41,007
No danger to society here.

1021
01:13:41,608 --> 01:13:43,072
God's honest truth.

1022
01:13:45,829 --> 01:13:47,593
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1023
01:13:57,741 --> 01:13:59,005
30 years.

1024
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:02,737
Jesus, when they say it like that...

1025
01:14:03,938 --> 01:14:05,202
You wonder where it went.

1026
01:14:08,085 --> 01:14:09,749
I wonder where ten years went.

1027
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:16,292
Here.

1028
01:14:16,793 --> 01:14:18,841
Little parole rejection present.

1029
01:14:20,797 --> 01:14:22,023
Go ahead and open it.

1030
01:14:23,824 --> 01:14:26,802
I had to go through one of your
competitors. I hope you don't mind.

1031
01:14:26,803 --> 01:14:28,268
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1032
01:14:39,024 --> 01:14:40,388
It's very pretty, Andy.

1033
01:14:42,194 --> 01:14:43,358
Thank you.

1034
01:14:45,831 --> 01:14:47,195
Are you going to play it?

1035
01:14:52,045 --> 01:14:53,110
No.

1036
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,089
Not right now.

1037
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,466
<font color=#ff00ff>[Guards shout]</font>

Tier 4 North. Clear.

01:15:11,223 --> 01:15:13,187
Tier 1 South. Clear.

1041
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:17,009
Fall in!

1044
01:15:53,106 --> 01:15:53,973

1050
01:16:29,301 --> 01:16:30,927
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Andy was as good as his word.

1051
01:16:31,528 --> 01:16:33,909
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1052
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:40,369
In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact

1053
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:43,531
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

1054
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:50,404
Appropriations Committee voted an
annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.

1055
01:16:50,605 --> 01:16:53,449
And you'd be amazed how
far Andy could stretch it.

1056
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:56,911
He made deals with book
clubs, charity groups.

1057
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:59,371
He bought remaindered books by the pound.

1058
01:17:00,372 --> 01:17:01,665
Treasure Island.

1059
01:17:02,066 --> 01:17:03,818
Robert Louis...

1060
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:04,710
...Stevenson.

1061
01:17:05,211 --> 01:17:06,850
Fiction, adventure.

1062
01:17:08,873 --> 01:17:09,999
What's next?

1063
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,190
I got here Auto Repair and...

1064
01:17:14,054 --> 01:17:15,271
...Soap Carving.

1065
01:17:15,472 --> 01:17:18,933
Trade skills and hobbies. Goes under
Educational. The stack behind you.

1066
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:20,960
The Count Of Monte Crisco.

1067
01:17:21,061 --> 01:17:23,279
That's Cristo, you dumb shit.

1068
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:27,158
By Alexandree... Dumass.

1069
01:17:27,759 --> 01:17:29,159
Dumb-ass?

1070
01:17:31,059 --> 01:17:32,159
Dumb-ass?

1071
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:37,101
Dumas. You know what that's about?

1072
01:17:37,502 --> 01:17:38,161
Uh-uh.

1073
01:17:39,062 --> 01:17:41,255
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

1074
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:44,842
We ought to file that under
Educational, too, oughtn't we?

1075
01:17:46,243 --> 01:17:49,893
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> The rest of us did our best to
pitch in when and where we could.

1076
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:52,683
By the year Kennedy was shot,

1077
01:17:52,884 --> 01:17:57,521
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of rat turds and turpentine

1078
01:17:57,522 --> 01:18:00,641
into the best prison library in New England,

1079
01:18:01,242 --> 01:18:04,503
complete with a fine
selection of Hank Williams.

1080
01:18:04,904 --> 01:18:08,357
<i># Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo #</i>

1081
01:18:08,658 --> 01:18:11,494
<i># All I do is sit and sigh... #</i>

1082
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:16,732
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out program.

1083
01:18:17,233 --> 01:18:19,326
You may remember reading about it.

1084
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:22,630
It made all the papers and got
his picture in Look Magazine.

1085
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:24,081
No free ride.

1086
01:18:24,582 --> 01:18:29,975
But rather a genuine, progressive advance,
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1087
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:33,157
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1088
01:18:33,558 --> 01:18:35,993
will be put to work outside these walls,

1089
01:18:36,394 --> 01:18:38,562
performing all manner of public service.

1090
01:18:39,163 --> 01:18:42,266
These men can learn the
value of an honest day's labor,

1091
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:46,020
while providing a valuable
service to the community and...

1092
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:51,316
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

1093
01:18:51,317 --> 01:18:54,069
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Of course, Norton failed
to mention to the press

1094
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:57,448
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1095
01:18:58,149 --> 01:19:00,701
There are a hundred different
ways to skim off the top.

1096
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:03,208
Men, materials, you name it.

1097
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:07,207
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

1098
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:09,418
If this keeps up, you'll
put me out of business.

1099
01:19:09,419 --> 01:19:11,670
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

1100
01:19:11,671 --> 01:19:13,797
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1101
01:19:13,798 --> 01:19:17,843
Ned,... we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1102
01:19:17,844 --> 01:19:21,264
Well, that's fine for the papers
but I've got a family to feed.

1103
01:19:21,765 --> 01:19:22,357
Sam...

1104
01:19:24,358 --> 01:19:26,101
Sam, we go back a long way.

1105
01:19:27,202 --> 01:19:31,541
I need this new highway contract.
I don't get it, and I go under. That's a fact.

1106
01:19:32,942 --> 01:19:36,637
You just have some of this fine pie
my missus made especially for you,

1107
01:19:37,238 --> 01:19:38,752
and you think about that.

1108
01:19:46,623 --> 01:19:49,125
Ned, I wouldn't worry too
much about this contract.

1109
01:19:49,626 --> 01:19:52,716
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1110
01:19:54,714 --> 01:19:57,379
You be sure and thank
Maisie for this fine pie.

1111
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:00,978
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> And behind every shady deal,

1112
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,472
behind every dollar earned,

1113
01:20:04,273 --> 01:20:06,822
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1114
01:20:07,685 --> 01:20:11,188
Two deposits. Maine National
and New England First.

1115
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:12,853
Night drops as always, sir.

1116
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,014
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1117
01:20:45,515 --> 01:20:47,492
Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1118
01:20:47,493 --> 01:20:48,292
Yes, sir.

1119
01:20:48,393 --> 01:20:51,329
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts
again, they'll hear about it from me.

1120
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:52,229
Yes, sir.

1121
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:53,414
How do I look?

1122
01:20:54,315 --> 01:20:57,109
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1123
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:58,499
The Governor's going to be there.

1124
01:21:00,038 --> 01:21:01,364
Want the rest of this?

1125
01:21:02,665 --> 01:21:04,529
The woman can't bake worth shit.

1126
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:07,199
Thank you, sir.

1127
01:21:09,989 --> 01:21:13,725
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

1128
01:21:13,726 --> 01:21:16,070
He's got scams you
haven't even dreamed of.

1129
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:18,197
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1130
01:21:18,298 --> 01:21:21,258
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1131
01:21:21,259 --> 01:21:24,295
But the problem with having all that
money is you'll have to explain...

1132
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,764
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1133
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:29,850
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1134
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:32,577
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1135
01:21:33,278 --> 01:21:35,330
I send that money out into the real world.

1136
01:21:35,431 --> 01:21:38,942
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1137
01:21:38,943 --> 01:21:39,735
Cleaner.

1138
01:21:40,236 --> 01:21:43,744
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1139
01:21:46,618 --> 01:21:50,621
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1140
01:21:51,122 --> 01:21:54,158
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1141
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,336
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1142
01:21:57,737 --> 01:22:01,923
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1143
01:22:02,424 --> 01:22:05,586
- it's gonna lead to somebody.
- Sure it is. But not to me.

1144
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,368
And certainly not to the Warden.

1145
01:22:11,935 --> 01:22:13,150
All right. Who?

1146
01:22:13,211 --> 01:22:14,603
Randall Stevens.

1147
01:22:15,304 --> 01:22:16,151
Who?

1148
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:21,652
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

1149
01:22:22,153 --> 01:22:24,104
That's where the filtering process starts.

1150
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:26,858
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1151
01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:28,826
But who is he?

1152
01:22:29,127 --> 01:22:31,253
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1153
01:22:31,454 --> 01:22:33,497
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1154
01:22:34,398 --> 01:22:37,076
I conjured him... out of thin air.

1155
01:22:37,877 --> 01:22:40,892
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1156
01:22:43,641 --> 01:22:46,301
Andy, you can't just make a person up.

1157
01:22:46,302 --> 01:22:49,513
Sure you can, if you know how the
system works, where the cracks are.

1158
01:22:49,914 --> 01:22:52,600
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1159
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:58,230
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,
a driver's license, social security number.

1160
01:22:58,531 --> 01:22:59,423
You're shitting me?

1161
01:22:59,424 --> 01:23:01,366
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1162
01:23:01,367 --> 01:23:04,028
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1163
01:23:04,529 --> 01:23:06,493
Well, I'll be damned.

1164
01:23:08,207 --> 01:23:09,733
Did I say you were good?

1165
01:23:10,334 --> 01:23:11,986
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

1166
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:14,213
You know, the funny thing is,

1167
01:23:14,414 --> 01:23:18,255
on the outside, I was an honest
man, straight as an arrow.

1168
01:23:19,219 --> 01:23:21,675
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1169
01:23:30,555 --> 01:23:31,990
Ever bother you?

1170
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:36,376
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1171
01:23:36,477 --> 01:23:38,103
Fine line maybe but...

1172
01:23:38,954 --> 01:23:41,298
I also built that library

1173
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:44,309
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1174
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:46,469
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1175
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:48,905
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1176
01:23:49,506 --> 01:23:50,916
Money instead of sheets.

1177
01:23:51,117 --> 01:23:53,710
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

came to Shawshank in 1965

1182
01:24:13,857 --> 01:24:15,683
on a two-year stretch for B&E.

1183
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,293
That's "breaking and entering" to you.

1184
01:24:19,094 --> 01:24:22,806
The cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1185
01:24:23,507 --> 01:24:24,941
Young punk.

1186
01:24:25,242 --> 01:24:26,569
Mr. Rock'n'roll.

1187
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:28,320
Cocky as hell.

1188
01:24:28,821 --> 01:24:33,350
Hey, come on, old boys! Moving like
molasses! Making me look bad.

1189
01:24:33,451 --> 01:24:34,994
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> We liked him immediately.

1190
01:24:35,495 --> 01:24:37,121
So I'm backing out the door, right?

1191
01:24:37,622 --> 01:24:39,414
And I got the TV like this.

1192
01:24:39,715 --> 01:24:43,335
It was a big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Suddenly, I hears this voice.

1193
01:24:43,336 --> 01:24:45,462
"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

1194
01:24:45,463 --> 01:24:47,214
Well, I just stand there,

1195
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:50,092
holding onto that TV. So,
finally, the voice says,

1196
01:24:50,093 --> 01:24:52,135
"Do you hear what I said, boy?"

1197
01:24:52,136 --> 01:24:54,596
I say, "Yes, sir, I sure did.

1198
01:24:54,597 --> 01:24:58,408
But if I drop this fucking thing,
you got me on destruction of property, too."

1199
01:24:58,409 --> 01:25:00,315
<font color=#ff00ff>[Laughter]</font>

1200
01:25:02,313 --> 01:25:05,407
Hey, you've done a
stretch in Cashman, right?

1201
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:09,027
Yeah. Yeah, that was an easy
piece of time, let me tell you.

1202
01:25:09,328 --> 01:25:11,738
Weekend furloughs, work programs.

1203
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:13,240
Not like here.

1204
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:15,659
Sounds like you done time
all over New England.

1205
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:18,412
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13.

1206
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:20,631
You name the place,
chances are I've been there.

1207
01:25:20,832 --> 01:25:23,118
Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?

1208
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:30,390
What I mean is, you don't seem to be a good
thief. Maybe you should try something else.

1209
01:25:30,491 --> 01:25:33,910
Yeah, well, what the hell
do you know about it, Capone?

1210
01:25:34,011 --> 01:25:35,446
What are you in for?

1211
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:36,652
Me?

1212
01:25:39,275 --> 01:25:40,939
The lawyer fucked me.

1213
01:25:44,972 --> 01:25:48,471
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

<font color=#ff00ff>[Laughter breaks out]</font>

1215
01:25:56,058 --> 01:26:00,108
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1216
01:26:00,872 --> 01:26:02,642
Maybe it was the thought
of them on the streets...

1217
01:26:02,643 --> 01:26:05,384
or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1218
01:26:06,085 --> 01:26:10,101
Whatever it was, something
lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1219
01:26:13,885 --> 01:26:17,220
I was thinking of maybe trying
for my high school equivalency.

1220
01:26:17,221 --> 01:26:19,186
I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1221
01:26:21,017 --> 01:26:23,106
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

1222
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:26,777
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1223
01:26:28,533 --> 01:26:30,697
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1224
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:33,613
You really mean that?

1225
01:26:34,614 --> 01:26:36,364
Yes, sir, I do.

1226
01:26:36,365 --> 01:26:42,008
Good. Because if we do this, we do it
all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

1227
01:26:42,455 --> 01:26:44,419
The thing is, see...

1228
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,422
...I don't read so good.

1229
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:49,458
Well.

1230
01:26:51,631 --> 01:26:53,357
You don't read...

1231
01:26:53,558 --> 01:26:55,322
so well.

1232
01:26:57,303 --> 01:26:58,850
We'll get to that.

1233
01:27:00,206 --> 01:27:01,790
- R.
- R...

1234
01:27:01,891 --> 01:27:02,850

<font color=#FF551>- RED:</font> So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1236
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:08,201
He started walking him through his ABCs.

1237
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:12,759
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

1238
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:15,600
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

1239
01:27:18,057 --> 01:27:21,835
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1240
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,278
He really liked the kid.

1241
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:26,628
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1242
01:27:27,592 --> 01:27:29,918
But that wasn't the only reason.

1243
01:27:30,419 --> 01:27:32,259
Prison time is slow time.

1244
01:27:33,422 --> 01:27:35,757
So you do what you can to keep going.

1245
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:38,009
Some fellas collect stamps.

1246
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:40,517
Others build matchstick houses.

1247
01:27:41,681 --> 01:27:43,937
Andy built a library.

1248
01:27:45,001 --> 01:27:46,727
Now he needed a new project.

1249
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:48,854
Tommy was it.

1250
01:27:49,655 --> 01:27:53,650
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1251
01:27:54,151 --> 01:27:57,359
The same reason,
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1252
01:27:58,556 --> 01:28:03,448
In prison, a man will do most
anything to keep his mind occupied.

1253
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:09,291
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams,

1254
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:11,714
it was lovely Raquel.

1255
01:28:13,713 --> 01:28:15,218
<font color=#ff00ff>[Clock ticks]</font>

1256
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:29,524
Time.

1257
01:28:35,451 --> 01:28:36,423
Well?

1258
01:28:38,029 --> 01:28:39,954
Well, it's for shit.

1259
01:28:40,655 --> 01:28:43,540
I wasted a whole fucking year
of my time with this bullshit.

1260
01:28:43,741 --> 01:28:45,493
It's probably not as bad as you think.

1261
01:28:45,494 --> 01:28:49,789
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1262
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:51,375
Let's see how the score comes out.

1263
01:28:51,376 --> 01:28:54,782
Well, I'll tell you how the
goddamn score comes out.

1264
01:28:56,597 --> 01:29:00,005
Two points right there.
There's your goddamn score!

1265
01:29:00,006 --> 01:29:04,592
Goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5x5 is 25.

1266
01:29:04,897 --> 01:29:07,812
Fuck this place! Fuck it!

1267
01:29:26,744 --> 01:29:29,579
I feel bad. I let him down.

1268
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,164
Ah, that's crap, kid.

1269
01:29:31,665 --> 01:29:33,091
He's proud of you.

1270
01:29:33,392 --> 01:29:36,203
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

1271
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:39,464
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

1272
01:29:39,765 --> 01:29:41,191
He used to be a banker on the outside.

1273
01:29:41,592 --> 01:29:43,418
What's he in here for, anyway?

1274
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:45,300
Murder.

1275
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:47,978
The hell you say!

1276
01:29:50,226 --> 01:29:52,099
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1277
01:29:53,562 --> 01:29:57,471
He caught his wife in bed with some
golf pro. He greased them both.

1278
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:07,034
What?

1279
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:10,395
About four years ago,

1280
01:30:10,896 --> 01:30:13,661
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1281
01:30:14,834 --> 01:30:17,999
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1282
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:23,465
About six months left to go,
I get a new cellmate in.

1283
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:25,623
Elmo Blatch.

1284
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:28,271
Big, twitchy fucker.

1285
01:30:28,972 --> 01:30:31,975
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1286
01:30:32,476 --> 01:30:34,602
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1287
01:30:35,503 --> 01:30:39,858
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1288
01:30:39,859 --> 01:30:42,741
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1289
01:30:43,988 --> 01:30:48,533
Talked all the time, too.
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1290
01:30:48,534 --> 01:30:50,160
Places he'd been in,

1291
01:30:50,661 --> 01:30:53,513
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1292
01:30:54,214 --> 01:30:55,912
Even people he'd killed.

1293
01:30:57,668 --> 01:30:59,924
People who gave him shit.

1294
01:31:01,088 --> 01:31:02,514
That's how he put it.

1295
01:31:03,815 --> 01:31:04,741
So...

1296
01:31:04,842 --> 01:31:06,806
one night, like a joke,

1297
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:11,347
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1298
01:31:11,848 --> 01:31:13,224
So he says...

1299
01:31:13,225 --> 01:31:16,733
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1300
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:21,446
So I could case all these
big rich pricks that come in.

1301
01:31:23,986 --> 01:31:25,867
So I pick out this guy,

1302
01:31:27,031 --> 01:31:29,996
go in one night and do his place.

1303
01:31:31,786 --> 01:31:33,070
He wakes up.

1304
01:31:33,871 --> 01:31:35,394
He gives me shit.

1305
01:31:36,957 --> 01:31:38,322
So I killed him.

1306
01:31:40,085 --> 01:31:42,550
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1307
01:31:44,465 --> 01:31:46,262
That's the best part.

1308
01:31:47,426 --> 01:31:52,686
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.
But she's married to some other guy.

1309
01:31:53,649 --> 01:31:55,814
Some hotshot banker.

1310
01:31:57,728 --> 01:31:59,693
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1311
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:14,964
I have to say that's the most
amazing story I ever heard.

1312
01:32:16,413 --> 01:32:19,374
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1313
01:32:19,875 --> 01:32:20,984
Sir?

1314
01:32:21,585 --> 01:32:22,836
Well...

1315
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:26,697
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1316
01:32:27,198 --> 01:32:31,269
He hears your tale of woe and quite
naturally wants to cheer you up.

1317
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:33,596
He's young, not terribly bright.

1318
01:32:33,997 --> 01:32:37,159
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1319
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,769
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1320
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:43,898
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1321
01:32:44,799 --> 01:32:47,110
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

1322
01:32:47,111 --> 01:32:49,404
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1323
01:32:49,405 --> 01:32:52,198
And by the way, add a life
term to my sentence"?

1324
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:55,351
That doesn't matter. With Tommy's
testimony, I can get a new trial.

1325
01:32:55,352 --> 01:33:00,473
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1326
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:02,842
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1327
01:33:02,943 --> 01:33:04,791
There's a chance, it isn't?

1328
01:33:07,256 --> 01:33:09,215
How can you be so obtuse?

1329
01:33:09,716 --> 01:33:10,597
What?

1330
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:16,055
- What did you call me?
- Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1331
01:33:16,356 --> 01:33:17,932
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1332
01:33:17,933 --> 01:33:23,662
The country club will have his old timecards,
records, W-2s, with his name on them.

1333
01:33:23,663 --> 01:33:27,050
Dufresne, If you indulge this
fantasy, that's your business.

1334
01:33:27,051 --> 01:33:29,895
Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.

1335
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,856
Sir, if I were to ever get out, I would
never mention what goes on in here.

1336
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:36,080
I'd be just as indictable as
you for laundering money.

1337
01:33:37,395 --> 01:33:42,557
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch! Not in this office.

1338
01:33:42,558 --> 01:33:45,268
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1339
01:33:45,269 --> 01:33:48,304
I'm just trying to set your mind
at ease, that's all. Sir, I...

1340
01:33:48,305 --> 01:33:49,664
Solitary. A month.

1341
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:52,016
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1342
01:33:52,017 --> 01:33:55,270
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

1343
01:33:55,271 --> 01:33:57,355
It's my life! Don't you understand, my life?

1344
01:33:57,356 --> 01:34:00,099
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1345
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:01,234
No!

1346
01:34:01,235 --> 01:34:02,753
A month in the hole.

1347
01:34:03,454 --> 01:34:06,022
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

1348
01:34:06,023 --> 01:34:07,699
It's all my fault.

1349
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:08,900
Oh, bullshit.

1350
01:34:09,991 --> 01:34:12,779
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1351
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:15,239
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1352
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,492
I mean, for real innocent?

1353
01:34:17,793 --> 01:34:19,019
It looks that way.

1354
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:21,246
Sweet Jesus.

1355
01:34:21,747 --> 01:34:23,473
How long's he been here now?

1356
01:34:23,874 --> 01:34:25,900
1947. What is that?

1357
01:34:26,001 --> 01:34:27,627
- 19 years.
<font color=#FF551>- TOMMY:</font> 19 years...

1358
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:30,434
<font color=#FF551>- GUARD:</font> Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1359
01:34:32,533 --> 01:34:35,164
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1360
01:34:36,095 --> 01:34:39,197
What you got? Board of Education.

1361
01:34:39,598 --> 01:34:42,249
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1362
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:44,978
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1363
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,343
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1364
01:34:48,107 --> 01:34:50,738
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1365
01:34:51,902 --> 01:34:54,292
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1366
01:34:55,155 --> 01:34:56,820
Hey, Red!

1367
01:34:58,367 --> 01:35:00,365
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1368
01:35:06,375 --> 01:35:08,039
Well, shit.

1369
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:23,474
The kid passed. C+ average.

1370
01:35:23,775 --> 01:35:25,440
Thought you'd like to know.

1371
01:35:42,019 --> 01:35:43,583
The Warden wants to talk.

1372
01:35:57,393 --> 01:36:00,767
- Out here?
- That's what the man said.

1373
01:36:16,996 --> 01:36:18,172
Warden?

1374
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:20,137
Tommy.

1375
01:36:26,622 --> 01:36:27,564
Tommy...

1376
01:36:27,965 --> 01:36:31,731
I'm asking you to keep this
conversation just between us.

1377
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:35,635
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1378
01:36:54,233 --> 01:36:56,197
We got a situation here.

1379
01:36:57,361 --> 01:36:59,487
I think you can appreciate that.

1380
01:36:59,488 --> 01:37:00,530
Yes, sir.

1381
01:37:01,031 --> 01:37:02,515
I sure can.

1382
01:37:02,816 --> 01:37:06,541
I tell you, son, this thing really came
along and knocked my wind out.

1383
01:37:08,372 --> 01:37:10,795
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1384
01:37:13,127 --> 01:37:14,691
The right thing to do.

1385
01:37:16,547 --> 01:37:19,829
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1386
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:22,582
You understand?

1387
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,244
I need your help, son.

1388
01:37:27,983 --> 01:37:30,068
If I'm going to move on this,

1389
01:37:30,269 --> 01:37:33,200
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1390
01:37:34,565 --> 01:37:38,267
I have to know if what you
told Dufresne was the truth.

1391
01:37:38,268 --> 01:37:39,652
Yes, sir.

1392
01:37:39,653 --> 01:37:41,062
Absolutely.

1393
01:37:41,563 --> 01:37:44,732
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury,

1394
01:37:44,833 --> 01:37:47,151
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1395
01:37:47,152 --> 01:37:49,945
and taken an oath before
Almighty God himself?

1396
01:37:49,946 --> 01:37:51,753
Just give me that chance.

1397
01:37:55,994 --> 01:37:57,541
That's what I thought.

1398
01:38:29,912 --> 01:38:31,876
<font color=#ff00ff>[Keys rattle]</font>

1399
01:38:44,351 --> 01:38:46,116
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1400
01:38:47,888 --> 01:38:49,143
A terrible thing.

1401
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:54,590
A man that young, less than
a year to go, trying to escape.

1402
01:38:55,395 --> 01:38:57,902
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1403
01:38:59,066 --> 01:39:00,530
Truly, it did.

1404
01:39:03,195 --> 01:39:05,559
We just have to put it behind us.

1405
01:39:07,449 --> 01:39:08,746
Move on.

1406
01:39:10,327 --> 01:39:11,683
I'm done.

1407
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:15,211
Everything stops.

1408
01:39:16,575 --> 01:39:19,090
Get someone else to run your scams.

1409
01:39:20,345 --> 01:39:22,110
Nothing stops.

1410
01:39:23,574 --> 01:39:24,938
Nothing.

1411
01:39:27,811 --> 01:39:30,475
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1412
01:39:31,473 --> 01:39:33,741
No more protection from the guards.

1413
01:39:34,142 --> 01:39:38,609
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1414
01:39:40,482 --> 01:39:42,464
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1415
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:45,804
And the library?

1416
01:39:46,405 --> 01:39:50,371
Gone. Sealed off, brick by brick.

1417
01:39:51,034 --> 01:39:53,711
We'll have us a little book
barbecue in the yard.

1418
01:39:53,712 --> 01:39:56,038
They'll see the flames for miles.

1419
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:58,821
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1420
01:40:00,127 --> 01:40:01,628
You understand me?

1421
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:03,693
Catching my drift?

1422
01:40:07,101 --> 01:40:09,065
Or am I being obtuse?

1423
01:40:20,522 --> 01:40:23,128
Give him another month to think about it.

1424
01:40:31,158 --> 01:40:33,122
<font color=#ff00ff>[Lock clicks]</font>

1425
01:41:10,038 --> 01:41:12,966
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1426
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:15,731
Like a closed book.

1427
01:41:16,661 --> 01:41:18,897
Complained about it all the time.

1428
01:41:19,498 --> 01:41:21,062
She was beautiful.

1429
01:41:23,594 --> 01:41:25,158
God, I loved her.

1430
01:41:28,882 --> 01:41:31,097
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1431
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,285
I killed her, Red.

1432
01:41:37,265 --> 01:41:39,230
I didn't pull the trigger.

1433
01:41:40,569 --> 01:41:42,433
But I drove her away.

1434
01:41:43,864 --> 01:41:46,190
That's why she died, because of me.

1435
01:41:46,691 --> 01:41:48,256
The way I am.

1436
01:41:57,119 --> 01:41:59,083
That don't make you a murderer.

1437
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:04,380
A bad husband, maybe.

1438
01:42:07,879 --> 01:42:11,040
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1439
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:12,142
No, I didn't.

1440
01:42:12,843 --> 01:42:14,365
Somebody else did.

1441
01:42:16,179 --> 01:42:18,144
And I wound up in here.

1442
01:42:20,642 --> 01:42:22,406
Bad luck, I guess.

1443
01:42:25,647 --> 01:42:26,540
Yeah.

1444
01:42:27,441 --> 01:42:28,917
It floats around.

1445
01:42:29,818 --> 01:42:31,961
It's got to land on somebody.

1446
01:42:32,962 --> 01:42:34,693
It was my turn, that's all.

1447
01:42:35,699 --> 01:42:38,039
I was in the path of the tornado.

1448
01:42:44,549 --> 01:42:48,082
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1449
01:42:52,591 --> 01:42:54,388
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1450
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:56,708
Me?

1451
01:42:59,523 --> 01:43:00,662
Yeah.

1452
01:43:02,025 --> 01:43:04,268
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1453
01:43:04,269 --> 01:43:07,651
and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1454
01:43:09,591 --> 01:43:11,255
I tell you where I'd go.

1455
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:14,195
Zihuatanejo.

1456
01:43:15,196 --> 01:43:16,697
Zi... what?

1457
01:43:16,698 --> 01:43:18,324
Zihuatanejo.

1458
01:43:19,425 --> 01:43:21,290
It's in Mexico.

1459
01:43:22,604 --> 01:43:24,794
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1460
01:43:25,966 --> 01:43:28,226
You know what the Mexicans
say about the Pacific?

1461
01:43:28,627 --> 01:43:29,669
No.

1462
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:32,534
They say it has no memory.

1463
01:43:34,716 --> 01:43:37,139
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1464
01:43:38,845 --> 01:43:41,210
A warm place with no memory.

1465
01:43:44,426 --> 01:43:46,399
Open up a little hotel,

1466
01:43:48,155 --> 01:43:49,814
right on the beach.

1467
01:43:50,315 --> 01:43:52,441
Buy some worthless old boat,

1468
01:43:52,742 --> 01:43:54,407
fix it up new.

1469
01:43:57,289 --> 01:43:58,781
Take my guests out.

1470
01:43:59,482 --> 01:44:00,746
Charter fishing.

1471
01:44:04,688 --> 01:44:06,694
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1472
01:44:09,843 --> 01:44:13,401
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1473
01:44:20,345 --> 01:44:22,935
I don't think I could make
it on the outside, Andy.

1474
01:44:29,813 --> 01:44:31,777
I've been in here most of my life.

1475
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,276
I'm an institutional man now.

1476
01:44:35,777 --> 01:44:37,241
Just like Brooks was.

1477
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:41,115
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1478
01:44:41,416 --> 01:44:42,880
I don't think so.

1479
01:44:45,629 --> 01:44:50,624
I mean... in here, I'm the guy who
can get things for you, sure, but...

1480
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:56,427
Outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1481
01:44:58,633 --> 01:45:00,151
The Pacific Ocean?

1482
01:45:00,952 --> 01:45:02,178
Shit.

1483
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:04,532
About scare me to death,
something that big.

1484
01:45:04,779 --> 01:45:05,732
Not me.

1485
01:45:07,033 --> 01:45:09,973
I didn't shoot my wife and
I didn't shoot her lover.

1486
01:45:11,813 --> 01:45:14,824
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1487
01:45:15,925 --> 01:45:17,873
That hotel, that boat.

1488
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:21,327
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1489
01:45:26,277 --> 01:45:28,838
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1490
01:45:28,939 --> 01:45:30,765
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1491
01:45:31,566 --> 01:45:34,109
I mean, Mexico is way the hell
down there and you're in here...

1492
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:35,437
and that's the way it is.

1493
01:45:36,238 --> 01:45:38,844
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1494
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:42,681
It's down there and I'm in here.

1495
01:45:45,313 --> 01:45:48,187
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice, really.

1496
01:45:50,944 --> 01:45:52,570
Get busy living

1497
01:45:53,671 --> 01:45:55,670
or get busy dying.

1498
01:45:59,786 --> 01:46:01,251
Andy.

1499
01:46:04,332 --> 01:46:05,497
Red.

1500
01:46:08,261 --> 01:46:10,562
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1501
01:46:10,963 --> 01:46:11,981
Sure, Andy.

1502
01:46:12,782 --> 01:46:13,595
Anything.

1503
01:46:15,401 --> 01:46:18,341
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1504
01:46:19,764 --> 01:46:22,642
Well, just... There's a lot
of hayfields up there.

1505
01:46:22,642 --> 01:46:27,871
One in particular. It's got a long rock wall,
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1506
01:46:27,872 --> 01:46:30,563
It's like something out
of a Robert Frost poem.

1507
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,250
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1508
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:40,055
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1509
01:46:41,077 --> 01:46:43,042
I asked and she said yes.

1510
01:46:47,292 --> 01:46:48,918
Promise me, Red,

1511
01:46:49,719 --> 01:46:53,227
if you ever get out, find that spot.

1512
01:46:54,591 --> 01:46:59,437
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that
has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1513
01:46:59,738 --> 01:47:03,220
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1514
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:09,187
There's something buried
under it, I want you to have.

1515
01:47:09,288 --> 01:47:10,773
What, Andy?

1516
01:47:11,274 --> 01:47:12,638
What's buried under there?

1517
01:47:14,653 --> 01:47:17,910
You'll have to pry it up... to see.

1518
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:25,534
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1519
01:47:26,598 --> 01:47:28,065
He's talking funnier.

1520
01:47:29,167 --> 01:47:32,727
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1521
01:47:32,728 --> 01:47:36,253
That's fine during the day, but
at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1522
01:47:37,459 --> 01:47:39,001
Oh, Lord.

1523
01:47:40,002 --> 01:47:40,924
What?

1524
01:47:42,514 --> 01:47:44,932
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1525
01:47:45,133 --> 01:47:48,619
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1526
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:52,481
- Six feet long.
- And you gave it to him?

1527
01:47:52,882 --> 01:47:56,643
- Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?
- Jesus, Heywood.

1528
01:47:56,644 --> 01:47:58,979
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1529
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,981
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1530
01:48:00,982 --> 01:48:01,904
No.

1531
01:48:02,867 --> 01:48:04,577
Andy would never do that.

1532
01:48:05,278 --> 01:48:06,542
Never.

1533
01:48:08,406 --> 01:48:09,871
I don't know.

1534
01:48:12,335 --> 01:48:14,500
Every man has his breaking point.

1535
01:48:17,248 --> 01:48:19,282
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1536
01:48:19,283 --> 01:48:21,340
Just about finished, sir.

1537
01:48:37,997 --> 01:48:39,925
Three deposits tonight.

1538
01:48:47,829 --> 01:48:49,713
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1539
01:48:50,114 --> 01:48:53,659
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1540
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:55,015
Yes, sir.

1541
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:02,084
It's good having you back, Andy.

1542
01:49:02,585 --> 01:49:04,717

Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1567
01:52:10,923 --> 01:52:12,012
Him!

1568
01:52:13,451 --> 01:52:15,116
Open 237.

1569
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:20,949
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1570
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:22,976
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1571
01:52:23,027 --> 01:52:24,711
Don't say that to me again.

1572
01:52:24,712 --> 01:52:27,431
- But, sir, he wasn't.
- I can see that, Haig!

1573
01:52:27,832 --> 01:52:29,025
You think I'm blind?

1574
01:52:30,126 --> 01:52:33,236
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1575
01:52:33,237 --> 01:52:33,937
No, sir.

1576
01:52:35,422 --> 01:52:36,548
What about you?

1577
01:52:36,549 --> 01:52:37,667
Are you blind?

1578
01:52:38,468 --> 01:52:40,594
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1579
01:52:41,095 --> 01:52:44,473
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1580
01:52:44,474 --> 01:52:45,829
Dufresne.

1581
01:52:47,602 --> 01:52:49,752
He was in his cell at lights out.

1582
01:52:49,953 --> 01:52:52,644
It stands to reason he'd
still be here in the morning.

1583
01:52:53,649 --> 01:52:55,209
I want him found.

1584
01:52:55,610 --> 01:52:59,279
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1585
01:52:59,322 --> 01:53:00,302
Yes, sir!

1586
01:53:01,949 --> 01:53:04,414
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1587
01:53:07,371 --> 01:53:08,293
Stand.

1588
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:10,671
Well?

1589
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:15,378
Well, what?

1590
01:53:15,379 --> 01:53:18,720
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1591
01:53:19,884 --> 01:53:21,893
He must have said something.

1592
01:53:21,994 --> 01:53:23,520
No, sir, Warden.

1593
01:53:23,821 --> 01:53:25,260
Not a word.

1594
01:53:26,883 --> 01:53:29,364
Lord, it's a miracle!

1595
01:53:30,028 --> 01:53:32,871
A man up and vanished
like a fart in the wind.

1596
01:53:33,172 --> 01:53:34,806
Nothing left but...

1597
01:53:35,207 --> 01:53:37,709
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1598
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:41,154
And that cupcake on
the wall. Let's ask her.

1599
01:53:41,155 --> 01:53:45,697
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1600
01:53:46,202 --> 01:53:48,529
Ah... I guess not.

1601
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:51,090
Why should she be any different?

1602
01:53:52,491 --> 01:53:54,334
This is a conspiracy.

1603
01:53:54,735 --> 01:53:56,228
That's what this is.

1604
01:53:56,829 --> 01:53:58,955
One... big...

1605
01:53:59,356 --> 01:54:01,091
damn conspiracy!

1606
01:54:01,092 --> 01:54:02,844
And everyone's in on it!

1607
01:54:03,545 --> 01:54:05,417

1611
01:54:41,757 --> 01:54:45,775
Andy Dufresne escaped
from Shawshank Prison.

1612
01:54:48,164 --> 01:54:51,499
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,

1613
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,226
a bar of soap

1614
01:54:53,227 --> 01:54:57,486
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.

1615
01:55:01,886 --> 01:55:06,807
I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1616
01:55:07,108 --> 01:55:09,998
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1617
01:55:28,179 --> 01:55:30,143
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1618
01:55:31,307 --> 01:55:34,193
I imagine it appealed to
his meticulous nature.

1619
01:55:34,894 --> 01:55:36,670
An Ice Age here,

1620
01:55:37,171 --> 01:55:39,336
a million years of mountain-building there.

1621
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:43,598
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1622
01:55:44,328 --> 01:55:46,255
That's all it takes, really.

1623
01:55:47,156 --> 01:55:48,282
Pressure...

1624
01:55:48,683 --> 01:55:50,242
and time.

1625
01:55:51,243 --> 01:55:53,959
That and a big goddamn poster.

Like I said,

1628
01:55:58,968 --> 01:56:02,642
in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1629
01:56:05,558 --> 01:56:10,712
It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was
toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

1630
01:56:10,813 --> 01:56:12,877
A handful at a time.

1631
01:56:14,333 --> 01:56:16,385
I guess after Tommy was killed,

1632
01:56:16,686 --> 01:56:19,704
Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.

1633
01:56:19,705 --> 01:56:22,095
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1634
01:56:23,009 --> 01:56:25,073

1637
01:56:58,436 --> 01:57:01,619
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1638
01:57:05,527 --> 01:57:07,453
The guard simply didn't notice.

1639
01:57:08,054 --> 01:57:09,280
Neither did I.

1640
01:57:09,781 --> 01:57:14,497
I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?

<font color=#ff00ff>[Thunderclap]</font>

1642
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:24,414
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

<font color=#ff00ff>[Gags]</font>

500 yards.

1647
01:59:35,435 --> 01:59:38,516
That's the length of five football fields.

1648
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:41,811
Just shy of half a mile.

1649
02:00:23,474 --> 02:00:25,063
<font color=#ff00ff>[Laughs]</font>

1650
02:00:36,954 --> 02:00:41,783
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,

1651
02:00:42,184 --> 02:00:44,786
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1652
02:00:44,987 --> 02:00:47,589
strode into the Maine National Bank.

1653
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:49,516
Until that moment,

1654
02:00:49,717 --> 02:00:51,376
he didn't exist,

1655
02:00:51,677 --> 02:00:54,520
- except on paper.
- May I help you?

1656
02:00:54,521 --> 02:00:56,548
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> He had all the proper ID,

1657
02:00:56,649 --> 02:01:00,460
driver's license, birth certificate,
social security card.

1658
02:01:00,661 --> 02:01:03,638
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1659
02:01:03,689 --> 02:01:07,066
I must say, I'm sorry to
be losing your business.

1660
02:01:07,067 --> 02:01:08,951
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1661
02:01:09,152 --> 02:01:10,628
Thank you.

1662
02:01:11,029 --> 02:01:12,805
I'm sure I will.

1663
02:01:13,106 --> 02:01:14,916
Here's your cashier's check, sir.

1664
02:01:15,017 --> 02:01:16,443
Will there be anything else?

1665
02:01:16,844 --> 02:01:17,644
Please...

1666
02:01:18,228 --> 02:01:20,497
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1667
02:01:21,098 --> 02:01:22,791
I'd be happy to.

1668
02:01:24,292 --> 02:01:26,110
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1669
02:01:26,711 --> 02:01:30,887
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen
banks in the Portland area that morning.

1670
02:01:31,675 --> 02:01:38,323
All told, he blew town with better than
$370,000 of Warden Norton's money.

1671
02:01:38,724 --> 02:01:42,732
- Severance pay for 19 years.
<font color=#ff00ff>- [Phone rings]</font>

1672
02:01:48,818 --> 02:01:51,491
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1673
02:01:58,786 --> 02:02:00,750
<font color=#ff00ff>[Sirens wail]</font>

1674
02:02:30,067 --> 02:02:31,990
<font color=#ff00ff>[Sirens approaching]</font>

1675
02:02:43,831 --> 02:02:47,016
Byron Hadley? You have
the right to remain silent.

1676
02:02:47,017 --> 02:02:48,643
If you give up the right to remain silent,...

1677
02:02:48,644 --> 02:02:52,029
...anything you say will be held
against you in court of law.

1678
02:02:52,130 --> 02:02:53,590
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> I wasn't there to see it.

1679
02:02:53,591 --> 02:02:57,850
But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.

1680
02:03:04,093 --> 02:03:07,366
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1681
02:03:23,461 --> 02:03:24,694
Samuel Norton?

1682
02:03:24,795 --> 02:03:27,637
- We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
<font color=#ff00ff>- [Banging on door]</font>

1683
02:03:30,936 --> 02:03:31,544
Norton!

1684
02:03:32,045 --> 02:03:32,696
Open the door.

1685
02:03:33,297 --> 02:03:35,228
I'm not sure which key it is.

1686
02:03:37,927 --> 02:03:38,874
Norton!

1687
02:03:44,959 --> 02:03:46,623
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

1688
02:03:58,747 --> 02:04:02,016
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> I like to think the last
thing that went through his head,

1689
02:04:02,317 --> 02:04:03,910
other than that bullet,

1690
02:04:04,111 --> 02:04:08,394
was to wonder how the hell Andy
Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1691
02:04:09,583 --> 02:04:11,150
Carter, James...

1692
02:04:11,151 --> 02:04:14,512
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,

1693
02:04:14,813 --> 02:04:16,744
I got a postcard in the mail.

1694
02:04:17,975 --> 02:04:21,177
It was blank, but the postmark said...

1695
02:04:21,178 --> 02:04:23,313
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1696
02:04:23,914 --> 02:04:25,140
Fort Hancock.

1697
02:04:25,641 --> 02:04:27,267
Right on the border.

1698
02:04:27,768 --> 02:04:29,594
That's where Andy crossed.

1699
02:04:30,095 --> 02:04:34,153
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,

1700
02:04:34,717 --> 02:04:37,181
it always makes me laugh.

1701
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:40,546
Andy Dufresne,

1702
02:04:40,947 --> 02:04:45,173
who crawled through a river of shit
and came out clean on the other side.

1703
02:04:46,203 --> 02:04:47,829
Andy Dufresne,

1704
02:04:48,330 --> 02:04:49,928
headed for the Pacific.

1705
02:04:52,835 --> 02:04:55,361
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

1706
02:04:55,462 --> 02:04:59,257
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1707
02:04:59,258 --> 02:05:02,110
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1708
02:05:02,911 --> 02:05:04,846
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1709
02:05:04,847 --> 02:05:07,432
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

1710
02:05:07,433 --> 02:05:09,397
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

1711
02:05:10,986 --> 02:05:13,446
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

1712
02:05:13,647 --> 02:05:15,373
Andy being gone.

1713
02:05:15,674 --> 02:05:19,357
I have to remind myself that some
birds aren't meant to be caged.

1714
02:05:20,562 --> 02:05:22,327
Their feathers are just too bright.

1715
02:05:24,091 --> 02:05:26,217
And when they fly away,

1716
02:05:26,318 --> 02:05:30,618
the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1717
02:05:31,790 --> 02:05:33,233
But still...

1718
02:05:33,434 --> 02:05:37,583
the place you live in is that much more
drab and empty that they're gone.

1719
02:05:42,051 --> 02:05:44,482
I guess I just miss my friend.

1720
02:06:09,085 --> 02:06:10,441
Please sit down.

1721
02:06:15,951 --> 02:06:17,560
Ellis Boyd Redding.

1722
02:06:17,961 --> 02:06:21,422
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1723
02:06:22,023 --> 02:06:23,980
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

1724
02:06:26,228 --> 02:06:27,492
Rehabilitated?

1725
02:06:29,756 --> 02:06:31,521
Well, now, let me see.

1726
02:06:32,685 --> 02:06:35,299
You know, I don't have
any idea what that means.

1727
02:06:37,214 --> 02:06:39,840
Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society...

1728
02:06:39,841 --> 02:06:42,364
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1729
02:06:44,363 --> 02:06:46,527
To me, it's just a made-up word.

1730
02:06:47,691 --> 02:06:49,926
A politician's word so that...

1731
02:06:50,627 --> 02:06:55,711
young fellas like yourself can wear
a suit and a tie and... have a job.

1732
02:06:58,151 --> 02:06:59,916
What do you really want to know?

1733
02:07:01,004 --> 02:07:03,005
Am I sorry for what I did?

1734
02:07:03,406 --> 02:07:04,596
Well, are you?

1735
02:07:06,443 --> 02:07:09,308
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1736
02:07:10,514 --> 02:07:14,221
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1737
02:07:17,438 --> 02:07:20,402
I look back on the way I was then.

1738
02:07:22,109 --> 02:07:23,735
A young...

1739
02:07:24,536 --> 02:07:27,601
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1740
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:32,724
I wanna talk to him.

1741
02:07:34,621 --> 02:07:37,169
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

1742
02:07:37,833 --> 02:07:39,797
tell him the way things are.

1743
02:07:41,987 --> 02:07:43,252
But I can't.

1744
02:07:45,482 --> 02:07:47,347
That kid's long gone.

1745
02:07:48,761 --> 02:07:51,125
This old man is all that's left.

1746
02:07:52,773 --> 02:07:54,554
I gotta live with that.

1747
02:07:55,809 --> 02:07:59,771
Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word.

1748
02:08:00,672 --> 02:08:05,573
So you go on and stamp your form,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1749
02:08:06,679 --> 02:08:08,505
Because to tell you the truth,

1750
02:08:09,106 --> 02:08:11,087
I don't give a shit.

1751
02:08:49,530 --> 02:08:51,494
<font color=#ff00ff>[Gate closes]</font>

1752
02:09:11,009 --> 02:09:12,974
<font color=#ff00ff>[Siren passes outside]</font>

1753
02:09:37,559 --> 02:09:39,084
Here you go, miss.

1754
02:09:41,907 --> 02:09:43,545
Rest room break, boss?

1755
02:09:49,214 --> 02:09:53,689
You don't need to ask me every time you
need to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1756
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:55,867
Yes, sir.

1757
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:09,363
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> 40 years I've been
asking permission to piss.

1758
02:10:10,485 --> 02:10:13,375
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1759
02:10:17,225 --> 02:10:19,090
There's a harsh truth to face.

1760
02:10:20,871 --> 02:10:23,385
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

1761
02:10:31,723 --> 02:10:35,464
All I do any more is think
of ways to break my parole...

1762
02:10:36,228 --> 02:10:38,492
...so maybe they'd send me back.

1763
02:10:43,818 --> 02:10:46,283
A terrible thing to live in fear.

1764
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:50,938
Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well.

1765
02:10:52,527 --> 02:10:55,801
All I want is to be back
where things make sense,

1766
02:10:56,365 --> 02:10:59,246
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1767
02:11:01,245 --> 02:11:03,409
Only one thing stops me.

1768
02:11:04,773 --> 02:11:07,038
A promise I made to Andy.

1769
02:11:27,688 --> 02:11:28,952
Here it is.

1770
02:11:39,574 --> 02:11:41,239
Much obliged, sir.

1771
02:15:04,905 --> 02:15:06,869
<font color=#ff00ff>[Bird calls]</font>

1772
02:15:20,462 --> 02:15:21,837
<font color=#FF551>ANDY:</font> Dear Red,

1773
02:15:21,838 --> 02:15:24,381
if you're reading this, you've gotten out.

1774
02:15:24,582 --> 02:15:28,519
And if you've come this far, maybe
you're willing to come a little further.

1775
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:31,485
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1776
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:35,564
Zihuatanejo.

1777
02:15:36,828 --> 02:15:40,147
I could use a good man to help
me get my project on wheels.

1778
02:15:40,948 --> 02:15:44,581
I'll keep an eye out for you
and the chessboard ready.

1779
02:15:45,445 --> 02:15:46,604
Remember, Red,

1780
02:15:46,905 --> 02:15:49,431
hope is a good thing.

1781
02:15:49,532 --> 02:15:51,358
Maybe the best of things.

1782
02:15:51,559 --> 02:15:53,624
And no good thing ever dies.

1783
02:15:54,287 --> 02:15:57,230
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

1784
02:15:57,331 --> 02:15:58,958
and finds you well.

1785
02:15:59,459 --> 02:16:01,840
Your friend, Andy.

1786
02:16:36,037 --> 02:16:39,795
<font color=#FF551>RED:</font> Get busy living or get busy dying.

1787
02:16:42,419 --> 02:16:44,383
That's goddamn right.

1788
02:16:50,010 --> 02:16:52,219
For the second time in my life,

1789
02:16:52,220 --> 02:16:54,585
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1790
02:16:55,974 --> 02:16:58,058
Parole violation.

1791
02:16:58,559 --> 02:17:02,250
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1792
02:17:03,123 --> 02:17:05,149
Not for an old crook like me.

1793
02:17:05,350 --> 02:17:07,414
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1794
02:17:10,947 --> 02:17:15,655
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit
still or hold a thought in my head.

1795
02:17:16,119 --> 02:17:19,204
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1796
02:17:19,685 --> 02:17:24,798
A free man at the start of a long journey
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1797
02:17:27,797 --> 02:17:30,445
I hope I can make it across the border.

1798
02:17:31,943 --> 02:17:35,016
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1799
02:17:37,015 --> 02:17:40,805
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1800
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:44,335
I hope.
