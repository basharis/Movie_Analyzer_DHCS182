1
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:20,631
I never knew the old Vienna
before the war

2
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:23,051
with its Strauss music,
its glamour and easy charm.

3
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:25,692
Constantinople suited me better.

4
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,670
I really got to know it in
the classic period of the black market.

5
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,332
We'd run anything if people wanted it
enough and had the money to pay.

6
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,230
Of course, a situation like that
does tempt amateurs.

7
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,459
But, well, they, you know, they can't stay
the course like a professional.

8
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:42,631
Now the city, it's divided
into four zones, you know,

9
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:46,591
each occupied by a power, the American,
the British, the Russian and the French.

10
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,670
But the centre of the city,
that's international,

11
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,139
policed by an international patrol,
one member of each of the four powers.

12
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:55,772
Wonderful. What a hope they had,
all strangers to the place,

13
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:58,111
and none of them
could speak the same language,

14
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,670
except a sort of smattering of German.

15
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:02,819
Good fellows, on the whole.
Did their best, you know.

16
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,653
Vienna doesn't really look any worse
than a lot of other European cities.

17
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:07,971
Bombed about a bit.

18
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,150
Oh, I was gonna tell you. Wait.
I was gonna tell you about Holly Martins,

19
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:14,311
an American, came all the way
here to visit a friend of his.

20
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,191
The name was Lime. Harry Lime.

21
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,894
Now, Martins was broke,
and Lime had offered him

22
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,870
some sort, I don't know,
some sort of a job.

23
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:23,942
Anyway, there he was, poor chap,
happy as a lark and without a cent.

24
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,630
- Passport, please.
- Oh.

25
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,710
- What's the purpose of your visit here?
- Friend of mine offered me a job here.

26
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,350
- Where are you staying?
- With him. 15 Stiftgasse.

27
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,657
- His name?
- Lime. Harry Lime.

28
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:48,052
- Okay.
- Thought he'd be here to meet me.

29
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,420
- Speak English?
- English?

30
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,781
Little. Little.

31
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:39,620
Uh, 10 minutes too late.

32
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,581
- Already gone.
- Who?

33
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,630
Um, his friends and the, uh... no.

34
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,700
- Uh, coffin.
- Coffin?

35
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,812
Mr Lime's. An accident.

36
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,812
Knocked over by a car,
here in front of the house.

37
00:04:55,851 --> 00:04:59,138
Have seen it myself.
Killed at once, immediately.

38
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,458
Already in hell,

39
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,775
or in heaven.

40
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,695
Sorry for the gravediggers.
Hard work. It is frost.

41
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,732
Can you tell me, uh... who's the...

42
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,740
A fellow called Lime.

43
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,817
Like a lift to town?

44
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,301
I've got a car here.

45
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,381
Thanks.

46
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,630
- My name's Calloway.
- Martins.

47
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,732
- You a friend of Lime?
- Yeah.

48
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,972
- Been here long?
- No.

49
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,830
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you?
You could do with a drink.

50
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,420
Could you buy me one?
I haven't got any Austrian...

51
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,510
- Of course.
- Thanks.

52
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,611
Schmolka.

53
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,181
I guess nobody knew Harry like he did.

54
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,616
- Like I did.
- How long ago?

55
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,215
Back in school.

56
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,670
I was never so lonesome
in my life till he showed up.

57
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,421
- When did you see him last?
- September '39.

58
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,670
- When the business started?
- Mmm-hmm.

59
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,818
- See much of him before that?
- Once in a while.

60
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,660
- Best friend I ever had.
- That sounds like a cheap novelette.

61
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,061
I write cheap novelettes.

62
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,140
I'm afraid I've never heard of you.
What's your name again?

63
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,617
- Holly Martins.
- No, sorry.

64
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,139
You ever hear of The Lone Rider
of Santa Fe?

65
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,070
Can't say that I have.

66
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,413
Death at Double-X Ranch? Uh... "Ranch."

67
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:25,911
Nope.

68
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,189
He must've known I was broke.
He even sent me an aeroplane ticket.

69
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,736
- It's a shame.
- What?

70
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,893
Him dying like that.

71
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,461
Best thing that ever happened to him.

72
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,950
What are you trying to say?

73
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,940
He was about the worst racketeer
that ever made a dirty living in this city.

74
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,134
- Policeman, huh?
- Come on, have another drink.

75
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,790
No, I never did like policemen.
I have to call them sheriffs.

76
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,780
- Ever seen one?
- Pin it on a dead man.

77
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:59,055
Some petty racket
with gasoline or something.

78
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,270
Just like a cop.
You're a real cop, I suppose.

79
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,055
- It wasn't petrol.
- So it wasn't petrol.

80
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,870
So it was tyres or saccharin or...

81
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,670
Why don't you catch
a few murderers for a change?

82
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,774
Well, you could say that murder
was part of his racket.

83
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,630
It's all right, Paine. He's only
a scribbler with too much drink in him.

84
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,891
Take Mr Holly Martins home.

85
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:28,371
Holly Martins, sir?
The, uh... the writer?

86
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,854
The author of Death at Double-X Ranch?

87
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,590
- Listen, Callaghan...
- Calloway. I'm English, not Irish.

88
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,269
You're not going to close your
files at a dead man's expense.

89
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:39,949
So you're going to find me the real criminal?
Sounds like one of your stories.

90
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:43,029
When I'm finished with you,
you'll leave Vienna, you'll look so silly.

91
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,350
Here's some army money. It should see
you through tonight at Sacher's Hotel,

92
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,270
if you don't drink too much in the bar.

93
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,372
We'll keep a seat for you
on tomorrow's plane.

94
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,219
Please be careful, sir. Up we come.

95
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:02,212
- Written anything lately?
- Take him to Sacher's.

96
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,710
Don't hit him again if he behaves.

97
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,310
And you go carefully there.
It's a military hotel.

98
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,937
I'm so glad to have met you, sir.
I've read quite a few of your books.

99
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:14,172
I like a good western.

100
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,150
That's what I like about them, sir.

101
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,189
You can pick them up
and put them down anytime.

102
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:19,415
- Oh, Mr Hardtmuth.
- Yes, sir?

103
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,750
Major Calloway said this gentleman's
gotta have a room for the night.

104
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,978
- He'll be off tomorrow.
- Passport, please.

105
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,290
Can't very well introduce you
to everybody.

106
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,738
Would you mind filling this in?

107
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,230
- Mr Crabbin.
- What is it, Sergeant?

108
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,749
- Mr Holly Martins, sir.
- Who?

109
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,549
- The author. Thought you might be interested.
- Never heard of him.

110
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:39,870
He's very good, sir.
I've read quite a few of his books.

111
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,656
Have you, Sergeant? Author? Martins?
Thank you, Sergeant.

112
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,630
Mr Martins? My name's Crabbin.

113
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,949
I represent the CRS of GHQ.

114
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,310
- You do?
- Yes. Cultural Re-education Section.

115
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,629
Uh, propaganda. Very important
in a place like this.

116
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:58,549
We do a little show each week.
Last week we had Hamlet.

117
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:02,290
- The week before we had, um, something.
- The striptease, sir.

118
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:04,457
Yes, the Hindu dancers.
Thank you, Sergeant.

119
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,510
This is the first opportunity we've had
of making an American author welcome.

120
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,453
- Welcome?
- Now, I'll tell you what, Mr Martins.

121
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,949
On Wednesday night, at our institute,

122
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:14,109
we're having a little lecture
on the contemporary novel.

123
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,629
- Thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
- They wouldn't know me.

124
00:11:16,729 --> 00:11:19,589
Oh, nonsense. Your novels are very
popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?

125
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:22,910
- Very popular, sir.
- Very popular. Are you staying long?

126
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,070
How long can one stay here
on this stage money?

127
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,989
Listen, Mr Martins,
if you'd agree to be our guest,

128
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,377
we'd be delighted to have you.

129
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,310
- Would you?
- As long as you care to stay.

130
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,029
But he's due to leave tomorrow, sir.

131
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,575
Excuse me. Have you got a toothache?

132
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,190
- Number 8, Mr Martins.
- Come upstairs a moment.

133
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,230
- I know a very good dentist.
- I don't need a dentist.

134
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,589
Somebody hit me, that's all.

135
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:46,659
Goodness. We must report that to the police.
Were they trying to rob you?

136
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,269
Oh, just a soldier. I was trying
to punch his major in the eye.

137
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:52,149
- No. A major? Were you really?
- Heard of Harry Lime?

138
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:54,309
Well, I've heard of him, of course,
but I didn't exactly know him.

139
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,670
I was going to stay with him,
but he died Thursday.

140
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,029
Goodness, that's awkward.

141
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:00,909
That what you say to people after death?
"Goodness, that's awkward"?

142
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:03,456
Mr Martins. Excuse me. Telephone.

143
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,309
Who is it?

144
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:09,459
- Baron Kurtz.
- Must be some mistake. Yes?

145
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,029
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

146
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,309
I'd very much like to meet you, Baron.
Come around.

147
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:17,670
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel.

148
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,510
- Couldn't we meet at the Mozart Cafe?
- Where?

149
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,295
- Just around the corner.
- How will I know you?

150
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,696
I'll carry a copy of one of your books.
Harry gave it to me.

151
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,709
Be there in a moment. Wait a minute.

152
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,189
If I do this lecture business,
you'll put me up here a while?

153
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,109
- Certainly.
- It's a deal.

154
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,710
You ever read a book of mine called
The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?

155
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,829
No, not that one, sir.

156
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:40,350
It's a story about a man
who hunted down a sheriff

157
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,989
who was victimizing his best friend.

158
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,669
- Seems exciting.
- It is.

159
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:46,739
I'm gunning just the same way
for your Major Callaghan.

160
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,853
Sounds anti-British, sir.

161
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:05,537
- Baron Kurtz?
- Mr Martins?

162
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:08,852
Delighted to meet you.
Come, let's sit down here.

163
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,950
- What would you like? Tea? Coffee?
- Coffee.

164
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,910
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.

165
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,694
- Tension?
- Suspense.

166
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:21,989
You really liked it?

167
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:24,069
At the end of every chapter
you are left guessing

168
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:25,269
what he'll be up to next.

169
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,550
So, you were a friend of Harry's?

170
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,460
I think his best. Except you, of course.

171
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,856
The police have a crazy notion that
he was mixed up in some sort of a racket.

172
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,617
Everyone in Vienna is. We all sell
cigarettes and that kind of thing.

173
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,651
I tell you, I've done things that would
have seemed unthinkable before the war.

174
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:51,180
Once when I was hard up,
I sold some tyres on the black market.

175
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,110
I wonder what my father would have said.

176
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,018
I'm afraid the police meant
more than that.

177
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,452
They get rather absurd ideas sometimes.

178
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,629
He's somewhere now
he won't mind about that.

179
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:05,130
Even so, I'm not going
to leave it at this.

180
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:07,130
Will you help me?

181
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:10,660
I wish I could.

182
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,069
But, you know, I am an Austrian.

183
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:16,570
I have to be careful with the police.

184
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:19,297
I'm afraid I can't help you.

185
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,450
Except with advice, of course.

186
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,735
Advice.

187
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,269
We came out of his place like this,

188
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,451
and were walking this way.

189
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:35,019
A friend of his called to him
from over there.

190
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:39,295
Harry went across,
and from up there came the truck.

191
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:42,652
It was just about here.

192
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:45,456
Here?

193
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,335
Yes.

194
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,170
His friend and I picked him up.

195
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:53,974
Carried him across over here.

196
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,095
It was a terrible thing. Terrible.

197
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,539
We laid him down just about here.

198
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:07,229
And this is where he died.

199
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:09,411
Even at the end,
his thoughts were of you.

200
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,931
What did he say?

201
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:14,709
I can't remember the exact words, Holly.

202
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:17,869
I may call you Holly, mayn't I?
He always called you that to us.

203
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:21,589
He was anxious I should
look after you when you arrived,

204
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:25,549
to see that you got safely home,
tickets, you know, and all that.

205
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,413
But you said he died instantaneously.

206
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,895
Well, he died before
the ambulance could reach us.

207
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,909
Well, there was only you and this, uh...

208
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,629
this friend of his. Uh, who was he?

209
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,029
A Romanian. Mr Popescu.

210
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:42,210
I'd like to talk to him.

211
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:44,338
He has left Vienna.

212
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:51,810
- Uh, excuse me.
- Yes?

213
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:56,229
- Did you know Mr Lime well?
- Mr Lime? Yes.

214
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,935
- You remember me. Upstairs.
- Yes, I remember you.

215
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:01,292
Who used to visit Mr Lime?

216
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,738
Visit? Eh...

217
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:17,269
- What did he say?
- He says he doesn't know everybody.

218
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,530
Excuse me.

219
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:33,229
Who was at the funeral besides you?

220
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:35,149
Only his doctor, Dr Winkel.

221
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:36,614
Wasn't there a girl there?

222
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:41,894
Some girl of the Josefstadt Theatre.
You know what Harry was.

223
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:45,412
You oughtn't to speak to her.
It would only cause her pain.

224
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:48,813
Not necessarily.
She'd probably want to help.

225
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,749
What's the good of another post-mortem?

226
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:55,535
Suppose you dig up something,
well, discreditable to Harry?

227
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:59,452
- Would you give me your address?
- I live in the Russian sector.

228
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:02,269
But you'll find me at
the Casanova Club every night.

229
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:04,549
One has to work the best way one can,
you know.

230
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,509
- What's the name of this girl?
- I don't know.

231
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,099
I don't think I ever heard it.

232
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,060
You did mention the theatre.

233
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:13,974
Josefstadt.

234
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,379
But I still think it won't do
Harry any good.

235
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,772
You'd do better to think of yourself.

236
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:23,473
I'll be all right.

237
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:27,253
Of course. I'm so glad I've met you.

238
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,090
A master of suspense!
Such a good cover, I think.

239
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:37,269
- Number 8, please.
- Major Calloway's compliments, sir.

240
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:40,589
- Here's the ticket for the plane tomorrow.
- You tell the major I won't need it.

241
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:43,908
Oh, porter, order me a ticket tonight
for the Josefstadt Theatre.

242
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:45,749
- Ah, Mr Martins.
- Good evening, Mr Crabbin.

243
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:47,149
He said I was to drive you
to the airfield,

244
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:48,989
or take you to the bus, sir.
Whichever you prefer.

245
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:53,253
Didn't you hear Mr Crabbin offer me
the hospitality of the HQ BMT?

246
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:49,254
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

247
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,835
Afterwards.

248
00:19:14,848 --> 00:19:16,658
Uh, Miss Schmidt?

249
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:19,149
Oh, come in.

250
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:20,708
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

251
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:23,628
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
Excuse me.

252
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:27,629
You were... You were awfully good.

253
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:28,909
Do you understand German?

254
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:32,709
No. Excuse me. I could follow it fine.

255
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:34,629
- Oh, yes.
- Perhaps Harry told you about me.

256
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:36,379
My name is Holly Martins.

257
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:39,069
- No, he never told me about his friends.
- Oh.

258
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:40,549
- Would you like some tea?
- Thank you.

259
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:42,508
Someone threw me this packet last week.

260
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:45,989
Sometimes the British do instead
of flowers, you know, on the first night.

261
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:49,188
That was a bouquet, too, from an American.
Would you rather have whisky?

262
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,414
Oh, tea's fine.

263
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,932
Good. I wanted to sell it.

264
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,055
- Oh, there is some tea left.
- Had you known him some time?

265
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:02,309
- Yes.
- I wanted to talk to you. No, thank you.

266
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,252
I wanted to talk to you about him.

267
00:20:04,728 --> 00:20:08,229
There's nothing really to talk about,
is there? Nothing.

268
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:11,411
Well, I saw you at the funeral.

269
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,415
I'm so sorry. I didn't notice much.

270
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,028
You were in love with him, weren't you?

271
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:20,654
I don't know.

272
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:24,149
How can you know
a thing like that afterwards?

273
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:27,628
I don't know anything any more,
except I want to be dead, too.

274
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,140
Some more tea?

275
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:32,059
No. No tea.

276
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,378
Would you like a cigarette?

277
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:36,989
Oh, American. Thank you. I like them.

278
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:40,775
I was talking to another friend
of Harry's, a Baron Kurtz.

279
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:43,572
- Do you know him?
- No.

280
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:46,295
- He's got a little dog.
- Oh, yes, yes.

281
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:49,349
Don't understand what Harry saw
in a fellow like that.

282
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,851
That was the man who brought me
some money when Harry died.

283
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,308
He said Harry had been
anxious at the last moment.

284
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:58,572
Hmm. He said he remembered me, too.

285
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:01,948
Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.

286
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:03,891
Dr Winkel told me that.

287
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:06,530
Dr Winkel? Who's he?

288
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:11,260
A doctor Harry used to go to.
He was passing just after it happened.

289
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:13,777
- His own doctor?
- Yes.

290
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:17,869
Well, were you at the inquest?

291
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:20,448
Yes. They said it wasn't
the driver's fault.

292
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:23,669
Harry had often said what
a careful driver he was.

293
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:26,169
- He was Harry's driver?
- Mmm-hmm.

294
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:30,291
Well, uh... I don't get it.

295
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:35,909
All of them there!
Uh, Kurtz, this Romanian, uh... Popescu,

296
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:37,949
his own driver knocking him over,

297
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:40,177
his own doctor just passing by.

298
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:42,050
No strangers there at all.

299
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:45,268
I know.
I've wondered about it 100 times,

300
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:46,734
if it really was an accident.

301
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:55,370
What difference does it make?
He's dead, isn't he?

302
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:57,452
- But if it wasn't an...
- Fräulein Schmidt.

303
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:03,931
I must hurry.
They don't like us to use the lights.

304
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:07,254
- The porter saw it happen.
- Then why worry?

305
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:11,933
Look, do you know that porter?

306
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:15,929
Yes.

307
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,268
- What's he saying?
- He says it happened right down there.

308
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:27,869
Happened, yes.
Happened right down there.

309
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:30,620
- You saw it?
- Well, not saw, heard.

310
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:34,268
Heard. I heard the brakes.

311
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:37,908
And I got to the window and saw them
carry the body to the other side,

312
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:41,615
uh... of the Josef, the Josef...

313
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:44,029
Emperor Josef statue.

314
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,618
Why didn't they bring him in the house?

315
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:14,408
- Could he have been conscious?
- Conscious?

316
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:18,377
Uh, was he still alive?

317
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:22,068
Ah, alive! He couldn't have been alive,

318
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:24,978
not with his head in the way it was.

319
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,416
I was told that he did not die at once.

320
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,753
No, I mean that...

321
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:35,497
No, you...

322
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:43,651
- He was quite dead.
- He was... Oh, yeah. He was quite dead.

323
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:46,059
He was quite dead.

324
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:48,269
But this sounds crazy.

325
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:50,348
If he was killed at once,
how could he have talked about me

326
00:23:50,448 --> 00:23:52,416
and this lady here after he was dead?

327
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:54,453
Why didn't you say
all this at the inquest?

328
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:59,252
Uh, it's better not to be
mixed up in things like this.

329
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:00,769
Things like what?

330
00:24:03,368 --> 00:24:07,028
I was not the only one
who did not give evidence.

331
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:08,748
Who else?

332
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:11,508
Three men helped to carry
your friend to the statue.

333
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:12,868
- Kurtz?
- Yes.

334
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:14,348
- The Romanian?
- Yes.

335
00:24:14,448 --> 00:24:16,708
- And?
- There was a third man.

336
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:17,909
He didn't give evidence.

337
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:19,948
- You don't mean the doctor?
- No, no, no.

338
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:23,788
He came later, after they carried him
to the Josef statue.

339
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:24,969
What did this man look like?

340
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,132
I didn't see his face.

341
00:24:31,168 --> 00:24:33,694
He didn't look up. He was, uh...

342
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:36,814
quite, uh... gewöhnlich, ordinary.

343
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:40,657
He... He might have been

344
00:24:41,248 --> 00:24:42,739
just anybody.

345
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:46,898
Just anybody.

346
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:52,130
Hello? Hello.

347
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:56,369
Hello.

348
00:25:02,088 --> 00:25:03,249
Hello?

349
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,348
- Who was that?
- I don't know. They didn't answer.

350
00:25:09,448 --> 00:25:11,450
But I was told there were
only two men there.

351
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:13,948
You've got to tell your story
to the police.

352
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:15,748
The police? Why police?

353
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:20,788
It's nonsense! It is all nonsense!
It was an accident.

354
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:22,458
You don't know it was an accident.

355
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:24,508
You only saw a dead man
with three men carrying him.

356
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,068
I should have listened to my wife.

357
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:30,748
She said you were up to no good. Gossip.

358
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:32,508
Suppose I take your evidence
to the police?

359
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:36,788
Now, hold on.

360
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,456
I have no evidence.
I saw nothing, I said nothing.

361
00:25:46,568 --> 00:25:48,570
- It's not my business.
- Well, make it your business.

362
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:52,588
Hold on.

363
00:25:57,968 --> 00:26:01,868
I have always liked you,
but you must not bring this gentleman again.

364
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:03,868
You must go at once, please. Please!

365
00:26:05,848 --> 00:26:06,849
Please!

366
00:26:14,528 --> 00:26:16,417
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.

367
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:21,131
Well, if I do find out something,
can I look you up again?

368
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:23,948
Why don't you leave this town? Go home.

369
00:26:34,248 --> 00:26:36,012
What is it?

370
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:45,628
What's she talking about?

371
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:47,508
The police. They are searching my room.

372
00:27:18,008 --> 00:27:20,787
- What the devil?
- Getting around, Martins?

373
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:23,459
Oh, pinning things on girls now.

374
00:27:23,728 --> 00:27:25,890
Miss Schmidt, I should like
to see your papers, please.

375
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:28,450
Don't you give him anything.

376
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,848
Thank you.

377
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:36,308
You were born
in Graz of Austrian parents?

378
00:27:36,408 --> 00:27:37,898
Yes.

379
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:41,293
Paine.

380
00:27:56,528 --> 00:27:58,929
It's very good, sir, isn't it, eh?

381
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:00,813
How much did you pay for this?

382
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,948
I'm afraid I shall have to keep
this for a while, Miss Schmidt.

383
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:07,868
How do you expect her
to live in this city without her papers?

384
00:28:07,968 --> 00:28:09,547
Write her out a receipt, Paine.

385
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:12,548
- And give her a receipt for those letters, too.
- This way, miss.

386
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:15,748
I suppose it wouldn't interest you
to know that Harry Lime was murdered.

387
00:28:15,848 --> 00:28:18,419
You're too busy. You haven't even
bothered to get the complete evidence.

388
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:29,219
- Must you take those?
- They'll be returned, miss.

389
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:32,536
They are private letters.

390
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,028
That's all right, miss. Don't worry.

391
00:28:35,128 --> 00:28:37,414
We're used to it. Like doctors.

392
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:41,628
There was a third man there. I suppose
that doesn't sound peculiar to you.

393
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:44,188
I'm not interested in whether
a racketeer like Lime

394
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:46,747
was killed by his friends
or by an accident.

395
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:48,815
The only important thing
is that he's dead.

396
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,771
- I'm sorry.
- Tactful, too, aren't we, Callaghan?

397
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:55,948
- Calloway.
- Must you take those letters?

398
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:58,628
- Yes, I'm afraid so.
- They're Harry's.

399
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:02,129
- That's the reason.
- You won't learn anything from them.

400
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,628
They're only love letters.
There are not many of them.

401
00:29:06,728 --> 00:29:09,787
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt,
as soon as they've been examined.

402
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:12,971
There's nothing in them.
Harry never did anything.

403
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,816
Only a small thing once,
out of kindness.

404
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,532
And what was that?

405
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:21,218
You've got it in your hand.

406
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:23,613
Major Calloway.

407
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,970
- Finished?
- Yes. Okay.

408
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:29,971
You will have to come
with us, Miss Schmidt.

409
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:31,508
You're not locking her up.

410
00:29:31,608 --> 00:29:33,188
Go home, Martins, like a sensible chap.

411
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:35,450
You don't know what you're mixing in.
Get the next plane.

412
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:37,787
As soon as I get to the bottom of this,
I'll get the next plane.

413
00:29:37,888 --> 00:29:40,667
Death's at the bottom of everything, Martins.
Leave death to the professionals.

414
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:42,628
Mind if I use that line
in my next western?

415
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:44,668
You can't chuck me out.
My papers are in order.

416
00:29:44,768 --> 00:29:46,948
Here we are, miss.
Your receipt for the letters.

417
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:48,538
I don't want it.

418
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:51,649
Well, I've got it
when you want it, miss.

419
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:57,415
Anything really wrong with your papers?

420
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:02,452
They're forged.

421
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:04,938
Oh.

422
00:30:05,968 --> 00:30:07,378
Why?

423
00:30:08,247 --> 00:30:11,187
The Russians would claim me.
I come from Czechoslovakia.

424
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:36,747
What's she saying?

425
00:30:36,847 --> 00:30:38,987
Only complaining about the way
they behave in her house.

426
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:45,258
Give her some cigarettes.

427
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,227
- Uh, cigarettes, hmm?
- Danke.

428
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:57,652
Miss Schmidt, ready?

429
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:00,772
Now, look,

430
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:05,019
I'll, uh... straighten out
all this nonsense about Harry.

431
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:08,811
You'll be all right.

432
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:13,249
Sometimes he said I laughed too much.

433
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:19,787
Oh, what's the name of that doctor?
Harry's doctor?

434
00:31:19,887 --> 00:31:23,858
- Dr Winkel.
- What do you want to see a doctor for? Hmm?

435
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:26,308
- A bruised lip.
- Good.

436
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:43,448
Laboratory, we're coming right down.

437
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:52,976
You wait here, Miss Schmidt.

438
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:28,274
Is Dr Winkel in?

439
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:32,027
- Dr Winkel. I'm sorry. I don't speak German.
- Nein.

440
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:36,451
Please, won't you say that
I'm a friend of Harry Lime?

441
00:32:40,647 --> 00:32:42,116
Thank you.

442
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:01,507
- Dr Winkel?
- "Winkel."

443
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,530
Uh, Dr Winkel.

444
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:07,413
Quite a collection of, uh... collection.

445
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,690
Yes.

446
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:15,299
Come, come, come...

447
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:22,214
Is that your dog?

448
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:24,908
Yes. Would you mind, Mr, uh...

449
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:27,453
- Martins.
- Martins, coming to the point, please?

450
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,456
- Thank you.
- I have guests waiting.

451
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:33,288
- We were both friends of Harry Lime.
- I was his medical adviser.

452
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,258
I want to find out all I can.

453
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:38,067
- Find out?
- Hear the details.

454
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,867
I can tell you very little.

455
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:43,608
He was run over by a car.
He was dead when I arrived.

456
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:45,089
Who was with him?

457
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:47,372
Two friends of his.

458
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:50,209
You sure? Two?

459
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:52,377
Quite sure.

460
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:55,867
Could he have been at all conscious?

461
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:59,707
I understand he was, yes,
for a short time,

462
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:01,827
while they carried him across the road.

463
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:05,137
- In great pain?
- Mmm, not necessarily.

464
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:09,067
Could he have been capable
of making plans,

465
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:12,775
for me and others just...
Just during those few moments?

466
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:15,787
I understand he left some
instructions before he died.

467
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,288
I cannot give an opinion.
I was not there.

468
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:23,413
My opinion is, uh...
limited to the causes of death.

469
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:28,454
Have you any reason to be dissatisfied?

470
00:34:29,007 --> 00:34:32,454
Was it possible that his death
might have been

471
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:34,652
not accidental?

472
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:38,016
Could he have been...

473
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:40,537
Could he have been...

474
00:34:41,407 --> 00:34:42,897
Pushed, Dr Winkel?

475
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:46,617
"Winkel."

476
00:34:47,727 --> 00:34:49,729
I cannot give an opinion.

477
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:54,009
The injuries to the head and skull
would have been the same.

478
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,187
Major, may I see you
for a moment, please?

479
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:06,016
Certainly, Brodsky. What is it?

480
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,337
This forgery is very clever,

481
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:11,347
and we are interested in this case.

482
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:13,415
- Have you arrested the girl?
- No, not yet.

483
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:18,147
Please, keep this passport to yourself
until I make some inquiries. Will you, Major?

484
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:19,852
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

485
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:22,547
Right, sit down, Miss Schmidt.

486
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:25,267
We'll send your letters
and things back to you.

487
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:28,098
- And my passport?
- We'll need that for a while longer.

488
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:34,612
What did he mean?

489
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:37,889
You know as much as I do.

490
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:40,297
Miss Schmidt,

491
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,827
you were intimate
with Lime, weren't you?

492
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:46,147
We loved each other. Do you mean that?

493
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:48,853
- Do you know this man?
- I've never seen him.

494
00:35:49,087 --> 00:35:51,307
- Joseph Harbin.
- No.

495
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:53,808
- He works in a military hospital.
- No.

496
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:59,414
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt.
I'm in a position to help you.

497
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:01,217
I'm not lying.

498
00:36:02,087 --> 00:36:04,693
You're wrong about Harry.
You're wrong about everything.

499
00:36:05,047 --> 00:36:06,987
In one of his letters,
he asked you to telephone

500
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:09,587
a good friend of his called Joseph.

501
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:12,587
He gave you the number
of the Casanova Club.

502
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:14,815
That's where a lot of friends
of Lime used to go.

503
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:17,857
It wasn't important.

504
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,216
What was the message?

505
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:22,934
Something about meeting Harry
at his home.

506
00:36:23,287 --> 00:36:26,347
Harbin disappeared
the day you telephoned.

507
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:27,937
We've got to find him.

508
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:30,131
You can help us.

509
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:34,935
What can I tell you,
but you've got everything upside down.

510
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:37,227
Okay.

511
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:40,171
That American friend of yours
is still waiting for you.

512
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,375
He won't do you much good.

513
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:49,378
I thank you, Miss Schmidt.
We'll send for you when we want you.

514
00:36:57,727 --> 00:37:00,667
Hello, Mr Martins. I've been trying
to get you at your hotel.

515
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:02,627
I've arranged that lecture for tomorrow.

516
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:04,627
- Well, what about?
- On the modern novel.

517
00:37:04,727 --> 00:37:06,456
- You remember what we arranged.
- Oh.

518
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,456
Now, they want you to talk
on the crisis of faith.

519
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:11,966
- What's that?
- Oh, I thought you'd know. You're a writer.

520
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:13,151
But of course you do.

521
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:14,947
Good night, young man.
Oh, I've forgotten my hat.

522
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:17,368
- I'll let you know the time later.
- Mmm.

523
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:27,627
- Drink?
- Whisky.

524
00:37:27,727 --> 00:37:29,137
Two whiskies.

525
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:37,613
How much?

526
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,586
Oh, they don't take army money here.

527
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:41,416
How much did he say?

528
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:45,894
- Harry?
- Yes.

529
00:37:47,246 --> 00:37:49,773
He moved his head,
but the rest is good, isn't it?

530
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,458
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt.
- Good evening.

531
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:10,867
You've found out my little secret.

532
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:12,571
A man must live.

533
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:14,827
How goes the investigation?

534
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:17,507
- Have you proved the policemen are wrong?
- Not yet.

535
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:20,894
But you will. Our friend Dr Winkel
said you had called.

536
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:25,050
- Wasn't he helpful?
- Well, he was, uh... limited.

537
00:38:25,526 --> 00:38:27,907
- But Mr Popescu is here tonight.
- The Romanian?

538
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:30,327
- Yes, the man who helped carry him.
- I thought he'd left Vienna.

539
00:38:31,206 --> 00:38:32,697
He's back now.

540
00:38:33,927 --> 00:38:35,816
Well, I'd like to meet
all of Harry's friends.

541
00:38:36,006 --> 00:38:37,850
I'll bring him to you.

542
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:40,050
Haven't you done enough for tonight?

543
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:44,814
The porter said three men carried
the body, and two of them are here.

544
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:53,087
Who are you looking for now?

545
00:38:53,187 --> 00:38:55,227
Don't. Don't. Please don't.

546
00:38:56,847 --> 00:38:58,292
Silly-looking bunch.

547
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:02,946
- Mr Popescu, Mr Martins.
- How do you do?

548
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:04,987
- How do you do?
- Any friend of Harry is a friend of mine.

549
00:39:05,087 --> 00:39:07,307
- I'll leave you together.
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt.

550
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:09,250
- You remember me?
- Of course.

551
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:13,107
- I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr Martins.
- Oh, you did?

552
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:15,146
Not the sort of thing
I should confess to a stranger,

553
00:39:15,246 --> 00:39:18,186
but you have to break
the rules sometimes.

554
00:39:18,286 --> 00:39:21,628
Humanity is a duty.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?

555
00:39:21,728 --> 00:39:23,187
Keep the pack.

556
00:39:23,287 --> 00:39:24,786
I understand you were with Harry...

557
00:39:24,886 --> 00:39:26,267
Two double whiskies.

558
00:39:31,407 --> 00:39:33,147
It was a terrible thing.

559
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:35,374
I was just crossing the road
to go to Harry.

560
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:38,772
He and the Baron were on the sidewalk.

561
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:42,707
Maybe if I hadn't started to cross the road,
it wouldn't have happened.

562
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:46,254
I can't help blaming myself
and wishing things had been different.

563
00:39:47,086 --> 00:39:51,376
Anyway, he saw me and stepped
off the sidewalk to meet me.

564
00:39:52,127 --> 00:39:53,288
And the truck...

565
00:39:54,646 --> 00:39:58,936
It was terrible, Mr Martins. Terrible.
I've never seen a man killed before.

566
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:01,507
I think there was something funny
about the whole thing.

567
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,827
- Funny?
- Something wrong.

568
00:40:03,927 --> 00:40:05,452
Of course there was.

569
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:07,066
Some ice for Mr Martins.

570
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:08,587
You think so, too, hmm?

571
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:10,906
It was so terribly stupid
for a man like Harry

572
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:13,408
to be killed in an ordinary
street accident.

573
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:16,007
- That's all you meant?
- What else?

574
00:40:16,606 --> 00:40:17,813
Who was the third man?

575
00:40:19,892 --> 00:40:23,370
I oughtn't to drink it.
It makes me acid.

576
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:25,736
What man would you be
referring to, Mr Martins?

577
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:28,698
I was told that a third man
helped you and Kurtz carry the body.

578
00:40:29,046 --> 00:40:31,106
Oh, I don't know how you got that idea.

579
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:33,147
You'll find all about it
in the police report.

580
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:36,227
There was just the two of us.
Me and the Baron.

581
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:38,586
Who could have told you
a story like that?

582
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,088
The porter at Harry's place.
He was cleaning the window at the time.

583
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:43,747
And saw the accident?

584
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:45,827
No, no, he didn't see the accident,

585
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:47,736
but he saw three men carrying the body.

586
00:40:48,366 --> 00:40:50,667
Why wasn't he at the police inquiry?

587
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:52,186
He didn't want to get involved.

588
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:54,986
You'll never teach these Austrians
to be good citizens.

589
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,328
It was his duty to give the evidence.

590
00:40:58,327 --> 00:41:00,216
Even so, he remembers wrong.

591
00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:02,746
What else did he tell you?

592
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:06,226
That Harry was dead
before you got him to that statue.

593
00:41:06,326 --> 00:41:08,707
He probably knows a lot more than that.

594
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:11,617
- Somebody's lying.
- Hmm, not necessarily.

595
00:41:11,966 --> 00:41:14,786
The police say he was
mixed up in some, uh... racket?

596
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:16,866
Oh, that's quite impossible.

597
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:18,695
He had a great sense of duty.

598
00:41:19,287 --> 00:41:21,289
Your friend Kurtz
seems to think it was possible.

599
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:23,866
I understand how an Anglo-Saxon feels.

600
00:41:23,967 --> 00:41:25,650
The Baron hasn't travelled, you know?

601
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:27,976
He seems to have been around a bit.

602
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,567
Do you know a man called, uh... Harbin?

603
00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:34,226
- No.
- Joseph Harbin.

604
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,648
Joseph Harbin? No. No.

605
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:43,855
That's a nice girl, that,
but she ought to go careful in Vienna.

606
00:41:44,406 --> 00:41:48,093
Everybody ought to go careful
in a city like this.

607
00:41:51,406 --> 00:41:54,250
He will meet us at the bridge. Good.

608
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:35,451
Hello! Is it so very important for you?

609
00:42:35,566 --> 00:42:38,066
- Yes, it is.
- I am not a bad man.

610
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:40,453
I'd like to tell you something.

611
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:42,246
Tell me, how did the car...

612
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,626
Come tonight. My wife goes out.

613
00:42:46,726 --> 00:42:49,889
- All right, I'll come back, but...
- Shh! Tonight.

614
00:43:06,806 --> 00:43:08,046
Does that mean come in?

615
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:10,026
Oh, yes, yes. Come in.

616
00:43:10,126 --> 00:43:11,786
The porter's going to talk
to us tonight.

617
00:43:11,886 --> 00:43:13,626
Need we go through it all again?

618
00:43:13,726 --> 00:43:16,128
I can manage by myself. You busy?

619
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:19,066
Just another part I've got to learn.

620
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,611
Can I hear you?

621
00:43:21,326 --> 00:43:23,454
- In German?
- I can try.

622
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:25,306
Is it comedy or tragedy?

623
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:27,215
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.

624
00:43:27,366 --> 00:43:29,687
- Do I, uh... read...
- Well, you read this.

625
00:43:29,886 --> 00:43:32,935
Oh. Well, uh...

626
00:43:36,806 --> 00:43:39,987
- What's that?
- Uh, Heurigen, I guess.

627
00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:41,867
H-E-Z-T...

628
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:44,066
Oh, let me see.
No, no, that's not the cue.

629
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,930
It means she has to sit down.

630
00:43:50,206 --> 00:43:54,211
Well, uh... Frau Hausman...

631
00:43:55,726 --> 00:43:57,171
No, no.

632
00:43:58,167 --> 00:43:59,611
It's no good.

633
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:03,127
Bad day?

634
00:44:04,046 --> 00:44:05,890
It's always bad about this time.

635
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:09,529
He used to look in around 6:00.

636
00:44:11,726 --> 00:44:15,413
I've been frightened.
I've been alone without friends and money.

637
00:44:16,526 --> 00:44:18,449
But I've never known anything like this.

638
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:24,449
- Please talk. Tell me about him.
- Tell you what?

639
00:44:25,286 --> 00:44:27,414
Oh, anything. Just talk.

640
00:44:27,606 --> 00:44:30,894
Where did you see him last?
When? What did you do?

641
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:34,146
Oh, we didn't make much sense.
We drank too much.

642
00:44:34,246 --> 00:44:37,295
- Once he tried to steal my girl.
- Where is she?

643
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:41,146
Oh, that was nine years ago.

644
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:42,986
Tell me more.

645
00:44:43,086 --> 00:44:46,106
Well, it's very difficult.
You knew Harry.

646
00:44:46,206 --> 00:44:48,746
We didn't do anything very amusing.

647
00:44:48,846 --> 00:44:52,546
He just made everything
seem like such, uh... fun.

648
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:54,250
Was he clever when he was a boy?

649
00:44:54,646 --> 00:44:56,535
I suppose so. He could fix anything.

650
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:59,407
- What sort of things?
- Oh, little things.

651
00:44:59,646 --> 00:45:03,571
How to put your temperature up
before exam. The best crib.

652
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:05,986
How to avoid this and that.

653
00:45:06,086 --> 00:45:07,850
He fixed my papers for me.

654
00:45:08,926 --> 00:45:11,346
He heard the Russians
were repatriating people like me

655
00:45:11,446 --> 00:45:13,608
who came from Czechoslovakia.

656
00:45:14,126 --> 00:45:16,946
He knew the right person
straightaway for forging stamps.

657
00:45:17,046 --> 00:45:18,546
Yeah.

658
00:45:18,647 --> 00:45:21,506
When he was 14,
he taught me the three-card trick.

659
00:45:21,606 --> 00:45:23,017
That's growing up fast.

660
00:45:23,606 --> 00:45:25,017
He never grew up.

661
00:45:26,086 --> 00:45:28,612
The world grew up
around him, that's all.

662
00:45:30,726 --> 00:45:32,296
And buried him.

663
00:45:32,846 --> 00:45:34,257
Anna.

664
00:45:35,446 --> 00:45:36,607
You'll fall in love again.

665
00:45:37,326 --> 00:45:39,135
Don't you see I don't want to?

666
00:45:40,086 --> 00:45:41,531
I don't ever want to.

667
00:45:42,726 --> 00:45:44,137
Come on out and have a drink.

668
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,666
Why did you say that?

669
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:48,177
Seemed like a good idea.

670
00:45:49,606 --> 00:45:51,946
It was just what he used to say.

671
00:45:52,046 --> 00:45:55,015
Well, uh... I didn't learn that
from him.

672
00:45:56,446 --> 00:45:58,786
If we have to see the porter,
we'd better go.

673
00:45:58,886 --> 00:46:01,226
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly
for a couple of minutes?

674
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:02,346
I thought you wanted...

675
00:46:02,446 --> 00:46:04,826
A moment ago, you said
you didn't want to see the porter.

676
00:46:04,926 --> 00:46:07,133
We're both in it, Harry.

677
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:09,812
- Holly.
- I'm so sorry.

678
00:46:11,446 --> 00:46:12,936
It's all right.

679
00:46:13,686 --> 00:46:15,096
You might get my name right.

680
00:46:18,126 --> 00:46:21,016
You know, you ought to
find yourself a girl.

681
00:46:22,286 --> 00:46:24,626
His English is so very bad,
we'll let him talk German.

682
00:46:24,726 --> 00:46:26,266
If you'll just be good enough to...

683
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,811
Look.

684
00:46:29,806 --> 00:46:32,376
- That's Harry's place, isn't it?
- Yes.

685
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:35,266
- Let's go away.
- What's the matter?

686
00:46:35,366 --> 00:46:37,448
Let's not get into any more trouble.

687
00:46:38,646 --> 00:46:39,807
Wait here.

688
00:46:44,126 --> 00:46:45,346
What's the matter?

689
00:46:45,446 --> 00:46:47,186
Uh, what is, uh...

690
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:50,505
I... I don't understand.

691
00:46:50,606 --> 00:46:53,132
Um, porter, uh... dead.

692
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:54,826
Kaputt.

693
00:46:54,926 --> 00:46:57,205
The porter is...

694
00:46:59,046 --> 00:47:00,746
- Porter?
- He's murdered.

695
00:47:25,806 --> 00:47:27,887
I, uh... don't understand.

696
00:47:38,966 --> 00:47:41,986
- What is it?
- The porter's been murdered.

697
00:47:47,566 --> 00:47:49,846
They think you did it.

698
00:48:10,206 --> 00:48:11,969
Papa!

699
00:48:41,525 --> 00:48:42,826
Their money's no good.

700
00:48:58,446 --> 00:49:00,146
Sneak out the other way
and go back to your theatre.

701
00:49:00,246 --> 00:49:01,665
I'd better not see you again.

702
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:04,026
- What are you going to do?
- I wish I knew.

703
00:49:04,126 --> 00:49:06,526
Be sensible. Tell Major Calloway.

704
00:49:27,846 --> 00:49:30,706
- Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
- Oh, Mr Martins.

705
00:49:30,806 --> 00:49:32,666
It's very urgent.
Just get him on the telephone.

706
00:49:32,766 --> 00:49:34,185
Uh, do you know his number?

707
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:36,265
- No, I don't know his number.
- I'll look it up for you.

708
00:49:36,366 --> 00:49:38,129
Is there a car here I can use?

709
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:41,131
Of course. There's one waiting for you.

710
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:45,344
Never mind about the number.

711
00:49:52,126 --> 00:49:53,730
Take me to the headquarters...

712
00:49:58,085 --> 00:50:01,408
Hold on! Hold on! I haven't even
told you where to take me yet!

713
00:50:04,526 --> 00:50:06,369
Driver! Driver!

714
00:50:09,326 --> 00:50:10,826
Slow down!

715
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,695
Have you got orders to kill me?

716
00:50:49,622 --> 00:50:52,106
Mr Martins! What a relief to see you.

717
00:50:52,206 --> 00:50:54,226
I was beginning to think
something had happened to you.

718
00:50:54,326 --> 00:50:56,373
Come along, Mr Martins.
Everything's ready for you.

719
00:50:56,846 --> 00:51:00,185
I was frantic in case you hadn't
got my message at the hotel.

720
00:51:00,285 --> 00:51:02,985
The porters out here are so unreliable,
if you know what I mean.

721
00:51:03,085 --> 00:51:05,745
We're all set for a wonderful meeting.

722
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:07,825
You'll find the audience
most appreciative.

723
00:51:07,925 --> 00:51:10,065
Oh, let me take your coat. I've got it.

724
00:51:10,165 --> 00:51:13,625
There'll be refreshments afterwards.
Come along, Mr M. Follow me.

725
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:16,345
Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
All's well that ends well.

726
00:51:16,445 --> 00:51:18,185
Would you look after those for me?
Thank you.

727
00:51:18,285 --> 00:51:20,625
Would you like to sit there, Mr Martins?
That's right.

728
00:51:20,725 --> 00:51:22,985
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have much pleasure in introducing

729
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:25,666
Mr Holly Martins from the other side.

730
00:51:30,406 --> 00:51:31,932
Well...

731
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:37,294
Bring the car and anyone
else who'd like to come.

732
00:51:37,525 --> 00:51:39,812
Don't be long. Hmm.

733
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:47,746
Yeah, well, I...
I suppose that is what I meant to say.

734
00:51:47,846 --> 00:51:49,265
Of course, of course, of course.

735
00:51:49,365 --> 00:51:52,175
Do you believe, Mr Martins,
in the stream of consciousness?

736
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:58,346
Stream of consciousness? Well, uh...

737
00:51:58,446 --> 00:51:59,446
Well...

738
00:51:59,565 --> 00:52:02,092
What author has chiefly influenced you?

739
00:52:02,645 --> 00:52:05,047
- Grey.
- Grey? What Grey?

740
00:52:05,725 --> 00:52:08,585
- Zane Grey.
- That's Mr Martins' little joke, of course.

741
00:52:08,686 --> 00:52:12,406
We all know perfectly well
Zane Grey wrote what we call "westerns."

742
00:52:12,526 --> 00:52:13,945
Cowboys and bandits.

743
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:18,050
Mr James Joyce.
Now, where would you put him?

744
00:52:20,206 --> 00:52:22,545
Oh, uh... would you mind
repeating that question?

745
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:25,705
I said, where would you put
Mr James Joyce?

746
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:27,216
In what category?

747
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:31,166
Can I ask, is Mr Martins
engaged on a new book?

748
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:36,105
Yes. It's called The Third Man.

749
00:52:36,205 --> 00:52:38,890
- A novel, Mr Martins?
- It's a murder story.

750
00:52:39,885 --> 00:52:42,825
I've just started it.
It's based on fact.

751
00:52:42,925 --> 00:52:44,415
Why, it's Mr Popescu!

752
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:47,145
Oh, very great pleasure
to see you here, Mr Popescu.

753
00:52:47,245 --> 00:52:49,946
As you know, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Popescu is a very great supporter

754
00:52:50,046 --> 00:52:51,570
of one of our medical charities.

755
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:54,652
Are you a slow writer, Mr Martins?

756
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:56,505
Not when I get interested.

757
00:52:56,606 --> 00:53:00,371
I'd say you were doing something
pretty dangerous this time.

758
00:53:00,925 --> 00:53:03,656
- Yeah?
- Mixing fact and fiction.

759
00:53:04,005 --> 00:53:07,305
- Should I make it all fact?
- Why, no, Mr Martins.

760
00:53:07,405 --> 00:53:09,825
I'd say stick to fiction.
Straight fiction.

761
00:53:09,925 --> 00:53:12,785
I'm too far along
with the book, Mr Popescu.

762
00:53:12,886 --> 00:53:14,865
Haven't you ever
scrapped a book, Mr Martins?

763
00:53:14,965 --> 00:53:16,012
Never.

764
00:53:16,445 --> 00:53:17,686
Pity.

765
00:53:19,805 --> 00:53:21,985
Ladies and gentlemen, if there are
no more questions for Mr Martins,

766
00:53:22,085 --> 00:53:24,816
I think I can call the meeting
officially closed.

767
00:54:03,605 --> 00:54:06,085
Who's there? Who is it?

768
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:08,292
Who is it?

769
00:54:10,885 --> 00:54:13,206
It's all right. It's all right.

770
00:55:16,845 --> 00:55:19,145
I told you to go away, Martins.

771
00:55:19,245 --> 00:55:22,785
This isn't Santa Fe, I'm not a sheriff
and you aren't a cowboy.

772
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:25,625
You've been blundering around with
the worst bunch of racketeers in Vienna,

773
00:55:25,725 --> 00:55:28,265
your precious Harry's friends,
and now you're wanted for murder.

774
00:55:28,365 --> 00:55:30,745
- Put down drunk and disorderly, too.
- I have.

775
00:55:30,845 --> 00:55:33,664
- What's the matter with your hand?
- Parrot bit me.

776
00:55:33,765 --> 00:55:36,185
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.

777
00:55:36,285 --> 00:55:39,825
I'm only a little fool. I'm an amateur at it.
You're a professional.

778
00:55:39,925 --> 00:55:42,065
You've been shaking
your cap and bells all over town.

779
00:55:42,165 --> 00:55:46,056
Paine, get me the Harry Lime file,
and get Mr Martins a large whisky.

780
00:55:46,285 --> 00:55:48,526
I don't need your drinks, Calloway.

781
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:51,545
You will. I don't want
another murder in this case

782
00:55:51,645 --> 00:55:54,145
and you were born to be murdered,
so you're going to hear the facts.

783
00:55:54,245 --> 00:55:56,168
You haven't told me a single one yet.

784
00:55:58,165 --> 00:56:00,785
- Have you ever heard of penicillin?
- Well?

785
00:56:00,885 --> 00:56:03,665
In Vienna, there hasn't been
enough penicillin to go around.

786
00:56:03,765 --> 00:56:05,654
So a nice trade started here.

787
00:56:06,805 --> 00:56:09,745
Stealing penicillin
from the military hospitals,

788
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:13,705
diluting it to make it go further
and selling it to patients.

789
00:56:13,805 --> 00:56:15,784
- Do you see what that means?
- Are you too busy

790
00:56:15,885 --> 00:56:18,985
chasing a few tubes of penicillin
to investigate a murder?

791
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,529
These were murders.

792
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:23,304
Men with gangrened legs,

793
00:56:23,404 --> 00:56:26,136
women in childbirth,
and there were children, too.

794
00:56:26,805 --> 00:56:30,104
They used some of this
diluted penicillin against meningitis.

795
00:56:30,204 --> 00:56:31,944
The lucky children died.

796
00:56:32,044 --> 00:56:35,447
The unlucky ones went off their heads.
You can see them now in the mental ward.

797
00:56:35,884 --> 00:56:38,265
That was the racket
Harry Lime organised.

798
00:56:38,365 --> 00:56:41,664
Calloway, you haven't shown me
one shred of evidence.

799
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,504
We're just coming to that.

800
00:56:43,604 --> 00:56:46,176
Paine, magic lantern show.

801
00:56:47,165 --> 00:56:48,304
Very good, sir.

802
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,505
You know, Paine's one
of your devoted readers.

803
00:56:50,605 --> 00:56:53,734
He's promised to lend me one of your books.
Which one is it, Paine?

804
00:56:54,004 --> 00:56:55,585
The Lone Rider of Santa Fe, sir.

805
00:56:55,685 --> 00:56:57,545
That's right. The Lone Rider
of Santa Fe.

806
00:56:57,645 --> 00:56:59,864
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.

807
00:56:59,965 --> 00:57:01,330
Come on. Show me
what you've got to show.

808
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,053
- All right, Paine?
- Yes, sir.

809
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,105
Paine, Paine, Paine.

810
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:10,905
I got them muddled.

811
00:57:11,005 --> 00:57:13,325
It's the new lot
that's just come in for Mr Crabbin.

812
00:57:15,405 --> 00:57:20,366
See this man here? A fellow called Harbin,
a medical orderly at the general hospital.

813
00:57:21,245 --> 00:57:25,105
He worked for Lime and helped
to steal the stuff from the laboratories.

814
00:57:25,205 --> 00:57:27,345
We forced him to give information to us

815
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:29,905
which led us as far as Kurtz and Lime.

816
00:57:30,005 --> 00:57:32,344
But we didn't arrest them,
as our evidence wasn't complete

817
00:57:32,444 --> 00:57:34,745
and it might have spoiled
our chances of getting the others.

818
00:57:34,845 --> 00:57:38,104
- Next, Paine.
- I'd like a word with this orderly Harbin.

819
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,505
- So would I.
- Well, bring him in.

820
00:57:40,605 --> 00:57:42,704
I can't. He disappeared a week ago.

821
00:57:42,804 --> 00:57:45,145
This is more like a mortuary
than police headquarters.

822
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:47,896
We have better witnesses. Look here.

823
00:58:16,845 --> 00:58:17,926
How could he have done it?

824
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:20,745
£70 a tube.

825
00:58:20,845 --> 00:58:24,104
Go back to the hotel,
and do keep out of trouble.

826
00:58:24,204 --> 00:58:27,265
I'll try and fix things with the Austrian
police. You'll be all right in the hotel

827
00:58:27,365 --> 00:58:29,447
but I can't be responsible
for you on the streets.

828
00:58:29,565 --> 00:58:31,624
I'm not asking you to.

829
00:58:31,724 --> 00:58:33,090
I'm sorry, Martins.

830
00:58:33,724 --> 00:58:34,965
I'm sorry, too.

831
00:58:38,524 --> 00:58:40,545
You still got
that aeroplane ticket on you?

832
00:58:40,645 --> 00:58:42,705
We'll send one across
to your hotel in the morning.

833
00:58:42,805 --> 00:58:45,785
Thank you. Excuse me.

834
00:58:45,885 --> 00:58:47,984
Get me Austrian police headquarters.

835
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:50,345
Can I have that woman's passport?

836
00:58:50,445 --> 00:58:51,809
You know, the Anna Schmidt one.

837
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:54,450
Oh...

838
00:58:54,885 --> 00:58:56,544
We're not going to pick her up for that,
are we?

839
00:58:56,644 --> 00:58:59,888
What can we do?
We have our instructions.

840
00:59:45,805 --> 00:59:47,135
Me.

841
00:59:52,124 --> 00:59:53,853
It's me.

842
00:59:59,285 --> 01:00:00,286
Hello.

843
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,409
What is it? What's happened to you?

844
01:00:04,085 --> 01:00:05,246
Just came to see you.

845
01:00:07,005 --> 01:00:07,985
Come in.

846
01:00:08,085 --> 01:00:11,452
I thought you were going to keep away.
Are the police after you?

847
01:00:11,565 --> 01:00:13,009
I don't know.

848
01:00:14,525 --> 01:00:17,926
- You're drunk, aren't you?
- A bit. I'm sorry.

849
01:00:20,445 --> 01:00:23,653
But I did want to say goodbye
before I pushed off.

850
01:00:24,205 --> 01:00:26,525
- I'm going back home.
- Why?

851
01:00:28,364 --> 01:00:30,584
It's what you've always wanted.

852
01:00:30,684 --> 01:00:31,971
All of you.

853
01:00:33,364 --> 01:00:35,505
Kitty? Here, kitty.

854
01:00:35,605 --> 01:00:38,304
Kitty? Here, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

855
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:41,409
Don't you want to play, kitty?
Aw, sleepy? Sleepy, kitty?

856
01:00:43,365 --> 01:00:45,024
Not very sociable, is he?

857
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,808
No, he only liked Harry.

858
01:00:48,764 --> 01:00:50,344
What made you decide so suddenly?

859
01:00:50,444 --> 01:00:51,785
Uh, I brought you these.

860
01:00:51,885 --> 01:00:53,984
Uh, they got a little wet.

861
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:57,247
- What happened to your hand?
- A parrot...

862
01:00:58,124 --> 01:01:00,651
- Let it go.
- Have you seen Calloway?

863
01:01:02,044 --> 01:01:04,184
Imagine a parrot nipping a man.

864
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,447
- Have you?
- It's...

865
01:01:07,405 --> 01:01:09,544
Oh, I...

866
01:01:09,644 --> 01:01:13,825
I've been saying goodbye
all over, you know.

867
01:01:13,925 --> 01:01:15,006
He told you, didn't he?

868
01:01:16,725 --> 01:01:17,806
Told me?

869
01:01:18,124 --> 01:01:19,364
About Harry.

870
01:01:20,605 --> 01:01:21,731
Do you know?

871
01:01:23,405 --> 01:01:25,213
I've seen Major Calloway today.

872
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,249
He's better dead.

873
01:02:10,844 --> 01:02:13,904
I knew he was mixed up,
but not like that.

874
01:02:14,004 --> 01:02:17,008
I knew him for 20 years.
At least, I thought I knew him.

875
01:02:18,165 --> 01:02:21,704
Suppose he was laughing
at fools like us all the time?

876
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:25,224
- He liked to laugh.
- £70 a tube.

877
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:29,454
He wanted me to write
for his great medical charity.

878
01:02:29,565 --> 01:02:31,704
I'll put these flowers in the water.

879
01:02:31,804 --> 01:02:35,412
Perhaps I could have raised
the price to £80 for him.

880
01:02:35,524 --> 01:02:39,584
Oh, please. For heaven's sake,
stop making him in your image.

881
01:02:39,684 --> 01:02:42,945
Harry was real.
He wasn't just your friend and my lover.

882
01:02:43,045 --> 01:02:46,730
- He was Harry.
- Well, don't preach wisdom to me.

883
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:48,969
You talk about him

884
01:02:50,084 --> 01:02:52,212
as if he had occasional bad manners.

885
01:02:53,004 --> 01:02:54,064
No. I don't know.

886
01:02:54,164 --> 01:02:58,344
I'm just a hack writer
who drinks too much

887
01:02:58,444 --> 01:03:00,174
and falls in love with girls.

888
01:03:02,764 --> 01:03:05,864
- You.
- Me?

889
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:07,807
Don't be such a fool. Of course.

890
01:03:09,444 --> 01:03:12,984
If you'd rung me up and asked me
were you fair or dark

891
01:03:13,084 --> 01:03:14,734
or had a moustache,
I wouldn't have known.

892
01:03:16,364 --> 01:03:17,864
Oh, I am leaving Vienna.

893
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:23,176
I don't care whether Harry was murdered
by Kurtz or Popescu or the third man.

894
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:27,984
Whoever killed him,
there was some sort of...

895
01:03:28,084 --> 01:03:29,904
Justice.

896
01:03:30,004 --> 01:03:32,264
Maybe I would've killed him myself.

897
01:03:32,364 --> 01:03:34,765
A person doesn't change
because you find out more.

898
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:36,904
Look. I've got a splitting headache,

899
01:03:37,004 --> 01:03:40,144
and you stand there
and just talk and talk and talk.

900
01:03:40,244 --> 01:03:41,734
I... I hate it.

901
01:03:43,244 --> 01:03:47,024
That's the first time
I ever saw you laugh.

902
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:48,535
Do it again.

903
01:03:53,364 --> 01:03:55,332
There isn't enough for two laughs.

904
01:04:05,444 --> 01:04:07,526
I'd make comic faces

905
01:04:09,524 --> 01:04:12,972
and stand on my head
and grin at you between my legs

906
01:04:14,804 --> 01:04:16,807
and tell all sorts of jokes...

907
01:04:20,164 --> 01:04:22,610
I wouldn't stand a chance, would I?

908
01:04:33,884 --> 01:04:35,454
Well...

909
01:04:37,564 --> 01:04:41,250
You did tell me
I ought to find myself a girl.

910
01:05:11,404 --> 01:05:14,647
What kind of a spy do you think you are,
satchel foot?

911
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:18,734
What are you tailing me for?

912
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:23,045
Cat got your tongue?

913
01:05:25,844 --> 01:05:27,289
Come on out.

914
01:05:28,244 --> 01:05:30,895
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

915
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:35,733
Step out in the light,
and let's have a look at ya.

916
01:05:36,604 --> 01:05:37,784
Who's your boss?

917
01:05:53,884 --> 01:05:54,965
Harry.

918
01:06:21,964 --> 01:06:23,375
Harry!

919
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:14,372
I followed his shadow until suddenly...

920
01:07:15,004 --> 01:07:16,703
Well?

921
01:07:16,803 --> 01:07:18,064
This is where he vanished.

922
01:07:18,164 --> 01:07:21,264
- I see.
- I suppose you don't believe me.

923
01:07:21,364 --> 01:07:23,704
- No.
- Look. I tell you...

924
01:07:23,804 --> 01:07:25,984
- You don't think I'm blind, do you?
- Yes.

925
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,449
Where were you when you saw him first?

926
01:07:27,564 --> 01:07:28,824
Fifty yards right down there.

927
01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:30,023
Which side of the road?

928
01:07:30,123 --> 01:07:32,103
I was on that side.
His shadow was on that side.

929
01:07:32,203 --> 01:07:33,584
And there are no turnings
on either side.

930
01:07:33,684 --> 01:07:34,783
What about the doorways?

931
01:07:34,883 --> 01:07:37,184
- I tell you, I heard him running ahead of me!
- Yes, yes, yes.

932
01:07:37,284 --> 01:07:40,925
And then he vanished out there, I suppose,
with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...

933
01:07:58,843 --> 01:08:00,925
It wasn't the German gin.

934
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:32,543
Well, what's this? Where are we?

935
01:08:32,644 --> 01:08:34,133
It's the main sewer.

936
01:08:35,443 --> 01:08:37,606
Runs right into the blue Danube.

937
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,449
Smells sweet, doesn't it?

938
01:08:42,763 --> 01:08:45,415
We should have dug deeper than a grave.

939
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:34,967
You knew him, Major?

940
01:09:35,723 --> 01:09:37,931
Hmm. Yes.

941
01:09:39,203 --> 01:09:40,933
Yes. Joseph Harbin.

942
01:09:41,764 --> 01:09:43,846
Medical orderly at the general hospital.

943
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:49,053
- He used to work for Harry Lime.
- Joseph Harbin?

944
01:09:49,244 --> 01:09:50,768
Yes.

945
01:09:51,123 --> 01:09:53,286
He's the man I told you was missing.

946
01:09:55,164 --> 01:09:57,643
Next time we'll have
a fool proof coffin.

947
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:08,303
Where are you taking me?

948
01:12:08,403 --> 01:12:11,303
International police headquarters,
just to check up.

949
01:12:19,323 --> 01:12:22,703
I'm sorry, miss. It's orders.
We can't go against the protocol.

950
01:12:22,803 --> 01:12:24,407
I don't even know what protocol means.

951
01:12:24,524 --> 01:12:25,729
Neither do I, miss.

952
01:12:26,524 --> 01:12:28,605
Mademoiselle, your lipstick.

953
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:30,290
Thank you.

954
01:12:42,684 --> 01:12:45,703
- Anna, what's happened to you?
- All right, all right. Keep out of this.

955
01:12:45,803 --> 01:12:49,023
Listen, I've got to talk to you.
I've just seen a dead man walking.

956
01:12:49,123 --> 01:12:51,410
- All right, chum. Get back.
- I saw him buried.

957
01:12:51,523 --> 01:12:53,844
- Have you?
- And now I've seen him alive.

958
01:13:02,203 --> 01:13:04,331
Just a minute. Bring her in here.

959
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:10,608
You stay out here.

960
01:13:11,603 --> 01:13:12,889
Come in, Miss Schmidt.

961
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:17,743
Now then, Miss Schmidt,
I'm not interested in your forged papers.

962
01:13:17,843 --> 01:13:19,223
That's purely a Russian case.

963
01:13:19,323 --> 01:13:21,623
When did you last see Lime?

964
01:13:21,723 --> 01:13:22,703
Two weeks ago.

965
01:13:22,803 --> 01:13:25,090
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt.
We know he's alive.

966
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:27,743
It is true, then.

967
01:13:27,843 --> 01:13:30,414
Joseph Harbin's body
was found in the coffin.

968
01:13:31,963 --> 01:13:33,663
What did you say? I'm sorry.

969
01:13:33,763 --> 01:13:36,209
I said another man
was buried in his place.

970
01:13:37,803 --> 01:13:39,343
Where's Harry?

971
01:13:39,443 --> 01:13:41,605
That's what we want to find out.

972
01:13:43,643 --> 01:13:47,329
I'm sorry. I don't seem able
to understand anything you say. I...

973
01:13:48,723 --> 01:13:50,248
He is alive.

974
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:52,583
Now this minute, he is doing something.

975
01:13:52,683 --> 01:13:56,663
Miss Schmidt, we know he's somewhere
across the canal in the Russian sector.

976
01:13:56,763 --> 01:13:58,447
You may as well help us.

977
01:13:58,563 --> 01:14:01,623
In a few minutes, Colonel Brodsky will
be questioning you about your papers.

978
01:14:01,723 --> 01:14:04,374
- Tell me where Lime is.
- I don't know.

979
01:14:05,283 --> 01:14:07,650
If you help me,
I am prepared to help you.

980
01:14:08,843 --> 01:14:10,971
Martins always said you were a fool.

981
01:14:12,203 --> 01:14:16,253
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt.
He can't get away. Right.

982
01:14:16,403 --> 01:14:17,768
Poor Harry.

983
01:14:19,123 --> 01:14:20,773
I wish he was dead.

984
01:14:22,603 --> 01:14:25,004
He would be safe from all of you then.

985
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:38,166
Why, that's you! Come up.

986
01:14:38,523 --> 01:14:40,983
Winkel, look who is here.

987
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:42,783
I want to speak to you, Kurtz.

988
01:14:42,883 --> 01:14:45,614
- Of course. Come up.
- I'll wait here.

989
01:14:45,923 --> 01:14:49,132
- I don't understand.
- I want to talk to Harry.

990
01:14:50,123 --> 01:14:52,543
- Are you mad?
- All right. I'm mad.

991
01:14:52,643 --> 01:14:56,125
I've seen a ghost.
You tell Harry I want to see him.

992
01:14:57,523 --> 01:14:59,823
Be reasonable. Come up and talk.

993
01:14:59,923 --> 01:15:02,733
No, thank you. I like the open.

994
01:15:03,923 --> 01:15:06,210
Tell him I'll wait by that wheel there.

995
01:15:07,723 --> 01:15:10,203
Or do ghosts only rise
by night, Dr Winkel?

996
01:15:11,923 --> 01:15:13,970
You got an opinion on that?

997
01:16:16,723 --> 01:16:19,223
Hello, old man. How are you?

998
01:16:19,323 --> 01:16:20,782
Hello, Harry.

999
01:16:20,882 --> 01:16:23,623
Well, well, they seem to be giving you
quite some busy time.

1000
01:16:23,723 --> 01:16:24,862
- Well, listen.
- Hmm, yes?

1001
01:16:24,963 --> 01:16:26,863
- I want to talk to you.
- Talk to me?

1002
01:16:26,963 --> 01:16:29,250
Well, of course. Come on.

1003
01:16:32,723 --> 01:16:34,783
Kids used to ride this thing
a lot in the old days.

1004
01:16:34,883 --> 01:16:36,222
But they haven't the money now,
poor devils.

1005
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:40,892
Listen, Harry. I didn't believe that...

1006
01:16:42,243 --> 01:16:43,404
It's good to see you, Holly.

1007
01:16:43,523 --> 01:16:44,782
I was at your funeral.

1008
01:16:44,882 --> 01:16:47,103
That was pretty smart, wasn't it?

1009
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,343
Oh, the same old indigestion, Holly.

1010
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:51,582
These are the only things
that help, these tablets.

1011
01:16:51,682 --> 01:16:54,582
These are the last. Can't get 'em
anywhere in Europe any more.

1012
01:16:54,683 --> 01:16:56,623
- Do you know what's happened to your girl?
- Hmm?

1013
01:16:56,723 --> 01:16:59,903
- She's been arrested.
- Tough. Very tough. But don't worry, old man.

1014
01:17:00,003 --> 01:17:02,623
- They won't hurt her.
- They're handing her over to the Russians.

1015
01:17:02,723 --> 01:17:04,743
What can I do, old man?
I'm dead, aren't I?

1016
01:17:04,843 --> 01:17:06,607
- You can help somehow.
- Holly...

1017
01:17:07,243 --> 01:17:09,862
Exactly who did you tell about me, hmm?

1018
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:12,582
- I told the police.
- Unwise, Holly.

1019
01:17:12,682 --> 01:17:14,943
- And Anna.
- Unwise.

1020
01:17:15,043 --> 01:17:17,943
Did the, uh... police believe you?

1021
01:17:18,043 --> 01:17:20,023
You don't care anything at all
about Anna, do you?

1022
01:17:20,123 --> 01:17:21,783
I've got quite a lot on my mind.

1023
01:17:21,883 --> 01:17:24,503
- You wouldn't do anything.
- What do you want me to do? Be reasonable.

1024
01:17:24,603 --> 01:17:26,663
- You can get somebody else...
- Do you expect me to give myself up?

1025
01:17:26,763 --> 01:17:28,702
- Why not?
- It's a far, far better thing that I do,

1026
01:17:28,802 --> 01:17:31,103
the old limelight,
the fall of the curtain.

1027
01:17:31,203 --> 01:17:33,410
No. Holly, you and I aren't heroes.

1028
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:34,943
The world doesn't make any heroes...

1029
01:17:35,043 --> 01:17:36,983
- You've got plenty of contacts.
- ...outside of your stories.

1030
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:39,342
I've got to be so careful.

1031
01:17:39,442 --> 01:17:43,023
I'm only safe in the Russian zone. I'm only
safe here as long as they can use me.

1032
01:17:43,123 --> 01:17:45,743
- As long as they can use you?
- I wish I could get rid of this thing.

1033
01:17:45,843 --> 01:17:49,703
So that's how they found out about Anna.
You told them, didn't you?

1034
01:17:49,803 --> 01:17:51,742
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.

1035
01:17:51,842 --> 01:17:53,822
- What do you expect me to be? Part of your...
- Part?

1036
01:17:53,922 --> 01:17:55,782
You can have any part you want
as long as you don't interfere.

1037
01:17:55,882 --> 01:17:58,063
I've never cut you out of anything.

1038
01:17:58,163 --> 01:18:01,302
Yes, I remember when they raided
the gambling joint, you knew a safe way out.

1039
01:18:01,402 --> 01:18:05,142
- Sure!
- Yeah, safe for you. Not safe for me.

1040
01:18:05,242 --> 01:18:08,406
Old man, you never should have
gone to the police, you know.

1041
01:18:10,082 --> 01:18:11,687
You ought to leave this thing alone.

1042
01:18:12,882 --> 01:18:15,742
Have you ever seen any of your victims?

1043
01:18:15,842 --> 01:18:19,183
You know, I never feel comfortable
on these sort of things.

1044
01:18:19,283 --> 01:18:21,728
Victims? Don't be melodramatic.

1045
01:18:23,442 --> 01:18:24,523
Tell me.

1046
01:18:25,562 --> 01:18:29,932
Would you really feel any pity if one
of those dots stopped moving forever?

1047
01:18:30,763 --> 01:18:33,862
If I offered you £20,000
for every dot that stopped,

1048
01:18:33,962 --> 01:18:36,142
would you really, old man,
tell me to keep my money?

1049
01:18:36,243 --> 01:18:40,407
Or would you calculate how many
dots you could afford to spare?

1050
01:18:40,522 --> 01:18:43,412
Free of income tax, old man.
Free of income tax.

1051
01:18:44,123 --> 01:18:46,222
The only way you can
save money nowadays.

1052
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:47,903
A lot of good your money
will do you in jail.

1053
01:18:48,003 --> 01:18:49,812
That jail's in another zone.

1054
01:18:50,803 --> 01:18:52,406
There's no proof against me...

1055
01:18:53,683 --> 01:18:55,047
Besides you.

1056
01:19:03,203 --> 01:19:05,205
I should be pretty easy to get rid of.

1057
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:08,728
Pretty easy.

1058
01:19:09,242 --> 01:19:10,528
I wouldn't be too sure.

1059
01:19:11,322 --> 01:19:12,768
I carry a gun.

1060
01:19:13,803 --> 01:19:16,965
I don't think they'd look for a bullet wound
after you hit that ground.

1061
01:19:19,643 --> 01:19:20,848
They dug up your coffin.

1062
01:19:25,403 --> 01:19:26,847
And found Harbin?

1063
01:19:36,162 --> 01:19:37,222
Pity.

1064
01:19:37,538 --> 01:19:39,182
Holly.

1065
01:19:39,282 --> 01:19:41,782
What fools we are
talking to each other this way

1066
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:44,622
as though I'd do anything to you
or you to me.

1067
01:19:44,722 --> 01:19:47,454
You're just a little mixed up
about things in general.

1068
01:19:47,562 --> 01:19:51,262
Nobody thinks in terms of human beings.

1069
01:19:51,362 --> 01:19:52,903
Governments don't. Why should we?

1070
01:19:53,003 --> 01:19:55,182
They talk about the people
and the proletariat.

1071
01:19:55,282 --> 01:19:58,623
I talk about the suckers and the mugs.
It's the same thing.

1072
01:19:58,723 --> 01:20:03,062
They have their five-year plans,
and so have I.

1073
01:20:03,162 --> 01:20:04,653
You used to believe in God.

1074
01:20:05,922 --> 01:20:08,607
Oh, I still do believe in God, old man.

1075
01:20:09,802 --> 01:20:13,143
I believe in God and mercy and all that.

1076
01:20:13,243 --> 01:20:18,693
But, the dead are happier dead.
They don't miss much here, poor devils.

1077
01:20:22,882 --> 01:20:24,726
What do you believe in?

1078
01:20:25,002 --> 01:20:30,042
Well, if you ever get Anna out of this mess,
be kind to her. You'll find she's worth it.

1079
01:20:30,363 --> 01:20:33,542
I wish I had asked you to bring me
some of those tablets from home.

1080
01:20:33,642 --> 01:20:36,532
Holly, I would like
to cut you in, old man.

1081
01:20:37,362 --> 01:20:39,142
There's nobody left
in Vienna I can really trust,

1082
01:20:39,242 --> 01:20:41,542
and we have always done
everything together.

1083
01:20:41,642 --> 01:20:43,182
When you make up your mind,
send me a message.

1084
01:20:43,282 --> 01:20:44,942
I'll meet you any place, any time.

1085
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:49,331
And when we do meet, old man,
it is you I want to see, not the police.

1086
01:20:50,082 --> 01:20:51,822
Remember that, won't you?

1087
01:20:51,922 --> 01:20:55,927
And don't be so gloomy.
After all, it's not that awful.

1088
01:20:56,163 --> 01:20:58,182
Remember what the fellow said.

1089
01:20:58,282 --> 01:21:00,102
In Italy, for 30 years under the Borgias

1090
01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:02,942
they had warfare, terror, murder
and bloodshed,

1091
01:21:03,042 --> 01:21:06,663
but they produced Michelangelo,
Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance.

1092
01:21:06,763 --> 01:21:09,022
In Switzerland, they had brotherly love.

1093
01:21:09,122 --> 01:21:15,129
They had 500 years of democracy and peace,
and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.

1094
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:16,688
So long, Holly.

1095
01:21:25,282 --> 01:21:27,542
But, look here, Martins.
You can always arrange to meet him

1096
01:21:27,642 --> 01:21:30,452
at some little cafe
here in the international zone.

1097
01:21:30,563 --> 01:21:32,405
- It wouldn't work.
- We'll never get him in the Russian zone.

1098
01:21:32,523 --> 01:21:34,571
Calloway, you expect too much.

1099
01:21:35,363 --> 01:21:38,809
Oh, I know he deserves to hang,
you proved your stuff.

1100
01:21:39,722 --> 01:21:41,850
But 20 years is a long time.

1101
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:43,687
Don't ask me to tie the rope.

1102
01:21:44,602 --> 01:21:46,172
Okay, forget it.

1103
01:21:47,963 --> 01:21:50,222
- Busy, Major?
- What is it, Brodsky?

1104
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,928
We have identified the girl.
Here is her report.

1105
01:21:55,322 --> 01:21:57,862
I've questioned her.
We've got nothing against her.

1106
01:21:57,962 --> 01:22:00,942
We shall apply for her
at the Four Power meeting tomorrow.

1107
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:02,249
She has no right to be here.

1108
01:22:05,322 --> 01:22:08,102
I've asked your people
to help with Lime.

1109
01:22:08,202 --> 01:22:09,342
That's a different case.

1110
01:22:09,442 --> 01:22:11,922
It is being looked into. So long, Major.

1111
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:19,209
In the last war, a general would hang
his opponent's picture on the wall.

1112
01:22:19,962 --> 01:22:21,822
He got to know him that way.

1113
01:22:21,922 --> 01:22:24,004
I'm beginning to know Lime.

1114
01:22:25,203 --> 01:22:28,570
I think this would have worked,
with your help.

1115
01:22:35,802 --> 01:22:37,292
What price would you pay?

1116
01:22:44,002 --> 01:22:45,242
Name it.

1117
01:23:14,562 --> 01:23:17,532
Here we are. You'll be
all right here, miss.

1118
01:23:21,242 --> 01:23:23,342
I don't understand Major Calloway.

1119
01:23:23,442 --> 01:23:25,142
I expect he's got
a soft spot for you, miss.

1120
01:23:25,242 --> 01:23:27,182
Why has he done all this?

1121
01:23:27,282 --> 01:23:30,445
Don't you worry, miss.
You're well out of things.

1122
01:23:30,962 --> 01:23:32,726
There we are, miss.

1123
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:36,651
- Thank you, you have been so kind.
- Well, I'll be saying good night.

1124
01:23:39,082 --> 01:23:40,702
- Good night, miss.
- Goodbye.

1125
01:24:19,362 --> 01:24:20,773
Are you going, too?

1126
01:24:21,842 --> 01:24:22,967
Oh...

1127
01:24:23,762 --> 01:24:25,022
What are you doing here?

1128
01:24:25,122 --> 01:24:26,965
I wanted to see you off.

1129
01:24:27,322 --> 01:24:28,767
See me off? From here?

1130
01:24:28,922 --> 01:24:32,369
Oh, I watched you out on the train.
Uh, no harm in that, is there?

1131
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:35,047
How did you know I would be here?

1132
01:24:35,401 --> 01:24:37,769
I heard something about it
at police headquarters.

1133
01:24:40,282 --> 01:24:42,410
Have you been seeing
Major Calloway again?

1134
01:24:42,802 --> 01:24:45,282
Of course not. I don't live
in his pocket.

1135
01:24:47,122 --> 01:24:48,647
Harry, what is it?

1136
01:24:49,842 --> 01:24:51,765
For heaven's sake,
stop calling me Harry.

1137
01:24:52,282 --> 01:24:54,042
I'm sorry.

1138
01:24:54,442 --> 01:24:56,142
- Hey, come on.
- What is on your mind?

1139
01:24:56,242 --> 01:24:57,261
Why did you hide here?

1140
01:24:57,361 --> 01:24:59,341
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?

1141
01:24:59,442 --> 01:25:01,822
- Here, it will be cold on that train.
- I shall be all right.

1142
01:25:01,922 --> 01:25:03,662
You send me a wire
as soon as you arrive.

1143
01:25:03,762 --> 01:25:05,141
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?

1144
01:25:05,242 --> 01:25:07,702
- He's safe in the Russian zone.
- How do you know?

1145
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:09,582
- Oh, I saw him today.
- How is he?

1146
01:25:09,682 --> 01:25:11,411
He can look after himself, don't worry.

1147
01:25:11,522 --> 01:25:14,062
- Did he say anything about me? Tell me.
- Oh, the usual things.

1148
01:25:14,162 --> 01:25:16,403
There's something wrong.
Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?

1149
01:25:16,521 --> 01:25:18,702
- Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
- Why should he help me like that?

1150
01:25:18,802 --> 01:25:19,862
The Russians will only make
trouble for him.

1151
01:25:19,962 --> 01:25:20,982
Oh, that's his headache.

1152
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:22,062
- His?
- Oh, well.

1153
01:25:22,162 --> 01:25:23,141
Why are you lying?

1154
01:25:23,241 --> 01:25:24,622
We're getting you
out of here, aren't we?

1155
01:25:24,722 --> 01:25:25,942
I'm not going.

1156
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:27,203
You...

1157
01:25:28,162 --> 01:25:31,644
Anna, don't you recognise a good turn
when you see one?

1158
01:25:31,921 --> 01:25:34,402
You have seen Calloway.
What are you two doing?

1159
01:25:36,402 --> 01:25:42,205
Well, they asked me to help take him,
and I'm helping.

1160
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:52,886
Poor Harry.

1161
01:25:53,282 --> 01:25:54,693
Poor Harry?

1162
01:25:56,801 --> 01:26:00,887
Poor Harry wouldn't even lift a finger
to help you.

1163
01:26:01,962 --> 01:26:05,091
Oh, you've got your precious honesty
and don't want anything else.

1164
01:26:05,802 --> 01:26:07,088
You still want him.

1165
01:26:07,401 --> 01:26:09,101
I don't want him any more.

1166
01:26:09,201 --> 01:26:13,446
I don't want to see him, hear him,
but he is still part of me. That's a fact.

1167
01:26:14,762 --> 01:26:17,623
I couldn't do a thing to harm him.

1168
01:26:36,202 --> 01:26:39,808
Oh, Anna, why do we always
have to quarrel?

1169
01:26:41,002 --> 01:26:45,212
If you want to sell your services,
I'm not willing to be the price.

1170
01:26:48,002 --> 01:26:52,325
I loved him. You loved him.
What good have we done him?

1171
01:26:53,321 --> 01:26:54,528
Love.

1172
01:26:56,682 --> 01:27:00,811
Look at yourself.
They have a name for faces like that.

1173
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:24,413
- Oh, Calloway.
- Oh, there you are.

1174
01:27:24,522 --> 01:27:25,661
Come in here, there isn't much time.

1175
01:27:25,761 --> 01:27:27,002
I want to get a plane
out of here tonight.

1176
01:27:28,801 --> 01:27:31,645
- So she talked you out of it.
- She gave me these.

1177
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:34,686
A girl of spirit.

1178
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:38,130
She's right. It is none of my business.

1179
01:27:39,121 --> 01:27:42,808
It won't make any difference
in the long run. I'll get him.

1180
01:27:43,562 --> 01:27:45,222
Well, I won't have helped.

1181
01:27:45,322 --> 01:27:47,450
That'll be a fine boast to make.

1182
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:49,563
Well, I always wanted you
to catch that plane, didn't I?

1183
01:27:50,122 --> 01:27:51,123
You all did.

1184
01:27:52,002 --> 01:27:55,848
I'd better see if there's anyone still
at the terminus. You may need a priority.

1185
01:27:57,722 --> 01:27:59,902
Do you mind if I drop off
somewhere on the way?

1186
01:28:00,002 --> 01:28:01,981
I've got an appointment,
it won't take five minutes.

1187
01:28:02,081 --> 01:28:04,061
- Of course.
- Why don't you come in, too?

1188
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:06,209
You're a writer. It might interest you.

1189
01:28:07,522 --> 01:28:10,142
This is the biggest children's hospital
in Vienna.

1190
01:28:10,242 --> 01:28:13,802
All the kids in here are the result
of Lime's penicillin racket.

1191
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:38,133
It had meningitis.
They gave it some of Lime's penicillin.

1192
01:28:39,842 --> 01:28:41,570
Terribly pity, isn't it?

1193
01:29:08,522 --> 01:29:12,413
Paine lent me one of your books,
Oklahoma Kid, I think it was.

1194
01:29:12,522 --> 01:29:15,501
I read a bit of it. Looks as if
it's going to be pretty good.

1195
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:19,606
What made you take up this sort of thing?
Been doing it for long?

1196
01:29:19,881 --> 01:29:21,142
All right, Calloway. You win.

1197
01:29:21,242 --> 01:29:23,142
I never knew
there were snake charmers in Texas.

1198
01:29:23,242 --> 01:29:25,323
- I said, you win.
- Win what?

1199
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:29,810
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.

1200
01:30:24,242 --> 01:30:25,368
Psst!

1201
01:30:35,601 --> 01:30:36,763
Paine.

1202
01:31:03,522 --> 01:31:04,647
Look, sir.

1203
01:31:12,202 --> 01:31:13,981
How much longer
are you going to sit here?

1204
01:31:14,082 --> 01:31:15,810
Shall I go over there, sir?

1205
01:31:16,121 --> 01:31:18,522
No, no. Leave them for a while.

1206
01:31:41,201 --> 01:31:43,010
Nein, danke. Nein.

1207
01:31:46,602 --> 01:31:48,781
Balloons?

1208
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:51,678
Go on, hop it, scarper!

1209
01:32:00,601 --> 01:32:02,221
Come on...

1210
01:32:02,321 --> 01:32:05,530
All right, all right. Only one.
Go on, scarper.

1211
01:32:43,761 --> 01:32:45,570
You should have gone.

1212
01:32:45,721 --> 01:32:48,725
- How did you know I was here anyway?
- From Kurtz.

1213
01:32:49,281 --> 01:32:51,141
They have just been arrested.

1214
01:32:51,241 --> 01:32:54,131
But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.

1215
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:57,301
Yes, Paine. Slip over there.
See what she is up to.

1216
01:32:57,401 --> 01:32:58,402
Right, sir.

1217
01:32:58,521 --> 01:33:01,525
Don't tell me you're doing
all this for nothing.

1218
01:33:03,561 --> 01:33:04,741
What is your price this time?

1219
01:33:04,841 --> 01:33:05,981
No price, Anna.

1220
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:10,564
Honest, sensible, sober,
harmless Holly Martins.

1221
01:33:11,761 --> 01:33:14,446
Holly, what a silly name.

1222
01:33:15,241 --> 01:33:18,563
You must feel very proud
to be a police informer.

1223
01:33:21,561 --> 01:33:23,768
Harry, get away! The police are outside.

1224
01:33:24,601 --> 01:33:26,046
- Quick!
- Anna.

1225
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:33,525
Shoot him! In the back!

1226
01:34:34,641 --> 01:34:35,642
All right.

1227
01:34:46,241 --> 01:34:47,925
Martins, get back!

1228
01:39:00,681 --> 01:39:01,682
Harry!

1229
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,700
Is that you? You're through, Harry.
Come out!

1230
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:08,940
You haven't got a chance this way.

1231
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,408
- What do you want?
- You might as well give up.

1232
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,932
Mr Martins, sir, get back!
Get back! Keep back, sir, come back!

1233
01:39:17,081 --> 01:39:18,320
Come back, sir!

1234
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,928
Martins! Martins!

1235
01:40:56,641 --> 01:40:57,880
Be careful, Martins!

1236
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,330
Don't take any chances!
If you see him, shoot!

1237
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,450
What time is it?

1238
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,161
2:30.

1239
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,969
I'll have to step on it,
if you're going to catch that plane.

1240
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:18,690
Calloway, can't you
do something about Anna?

1241
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,127
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.

1242
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:36,243
- Wait a minute. Let me out.
- Well, there's not much time.

1243
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:40,162
One can't just leave. Please.

1244
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,649
Be sensible, Martins.

1245
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:47,045
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
