1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,719
THE 400 BLOWS

2
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,912
This film is dedicated...

3
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,247
to the memory of André Bazin

4
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,117
Doinel! Bring me that!

5
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,459
Indeed! Go to the corner!

6
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,968
1 minute left!

7
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,095
Quiet!

8
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,641
We'll collect them in 30 seconds!

9
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,143
Quiet!

10
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,528
Line heads, get ready!

11
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,033
I'll count to 3

12
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,745
1...

13
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,997
2...

14
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,167
3! Collect!

15
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,885
Collect in back!

16
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,805
- Gimme!
- Wait a sec!

17
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,891
- What is it?
- He won't give it!

18
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,559
No favoritism!

19
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,479
Brown-noser!

20
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,232
Is everyone's paper in?

21
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,734
You may go!

22
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,905
Sorry! Not you!

23
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,034
Recess is a reward,
not an obligation!

24
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,157
Here
suffered Antoine Doinel unfairly...

25
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,244
punished by a prof
for a pin-up clad barely

26
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,372
So it's now forsooth,
eye for eye, tooth for tooth!

27
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,458
Alright, champs,
maybe you need a ref!

28
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,169
You can train for 3 days!
No recess!

29
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,588
3 days of rest will do you good!

30
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,685
Come look! This is funny!

31
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,980
What's so interesting there?

32
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,898
Take your seats!

33
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,657
Bravo!

34
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,329
We have a new Juvenal in our class!

35
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,708
But he can't tell
an Alexandrine from a decasyllable!

36
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,919
For tomorrow you'll conjugate...

37
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,171
Doinel, sit down!

38
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,259
in all tenses of the indicative...

39
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,013
conditional and subjunctive moods...
Your notebooks!

40
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,684
I dirty the classroom walls...

41
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,774
and misuse French versification

42
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,570
The Hare...

43
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,414
Doinel, go to the janitor and...

44
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,125
get something
to remove that nonsense...

45
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,711
or else you'll lick it off!

46
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:07,385
Richer, who said
you could change seats?

47
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,398
In the days when the bushes...

48
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,485
the bushes...

49
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,030
were aflame with flowers...

50
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,574
bright red...

51
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,414
When already the dark tips...

52
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,627
When already...

53
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,047
the dark tips...

54
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,843
of my long ears...

55
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,305
were seen...

56
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,519
above my head...

57
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,192
In the still unripe rye...

58
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,910
I munched on...

59
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,956
the leaves...

60
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,630
Pointing to the sky

61
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,015
One day...

62
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,563
comma... weary I lay...

63
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,153
in my den...

64
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,866
with sleep-filled eyes...

65
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,828
When little Margot
found me by surprise!

66
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,710
- Right, Simonot?
- It wasn't me, sir!

67
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,128
Sure! The other guy!

68
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,839
True, she liked me...

69
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,841
very much...

70
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,053
my gentle mistress!

71
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,648
How good to me...

72
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,360
so caring... such tenderness!

73
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,531
How she held me on her lap...

74
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,742
and kissed me!

75
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,870
What fool whistled?

76
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,873
Confess or I'll punish anybody!

77
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,541
Right, Simonot?

78
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,210
I swear, sir!

79
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,753
It wasn't me!

80
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,047
And you're cowards!

81
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,840
What a class!

82
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,761
I've known morons
but at least they didn't let it show

83
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,222
They hid in their corner

84
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,182
And you?

85
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,186
Call that clean! You've made
it dirtier! Copy the poem!

86
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,687
Your parents'll pay

87
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,732
What'll France be like in 10 years?

88
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,327
- All guys rob their parents.
- Yeah but it's hard

89
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,246
Even Mauricet!

90
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,250
Mauricet!
Where'd you buy those goggles?

91
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,043
A department store

92
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,588
Did ya swipe the money
from your dad or your ma?

93
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,175
Don't tell me
ya don't go through their pockets!

94
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,554
And ya got me caught earlier!

95
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,014
Ya bastard!

96
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,560
- Your days're numbered!
- You'll get yours!

97
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,523
I'll never do it all tonight

98
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,034
That prof's a bastard

99
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,536
It's his job!

100
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,872
But before I'm drafted...

101
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,541
I'll bash his head in!

102
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,546
That I would have dirtied
the classroom walls

103
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,062
- Evening, Mama!
- Good evening...

104
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,155
Where's the flour?

105
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,534
- What flour?
- You didn't buy what I wrote down!

106
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,580
- Where's the list I left you?
- I lost it

107
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,207
No wonder
you get such bad grades!

108
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,043
Get my slippers!

109
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,213
In the bedroom!

110
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,715
Under the bed!

111
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,348
I need some flour

112
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,224
Go get it at once!

113
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,145
Yes, Mama

114
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,288
They used forceps.
He came out ass first!

115
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,166
It's hereditary!
His mother was the same way

116
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:39,545
It means nothing! Look at my Fanny!
It was over in 10 minutes

117
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,424
But for the little one,
if I hadn't had a Caesarean...

118
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,426
we wouldn't be talkin' now!

119
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,679
And my sister... One a year!
Can you imagine?

120
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,354
They finally took out everything.
Blood all over the place!

121
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,858
In a rush, son?

122
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,152
I just got hell for some flour

123
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:07,740
Don't upset your mother!
She has to be handled with care

124
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,661
- What's that?
- An anti-fog spotlight

125
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,871
I'm gonna try it out Sunday

126
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,009
Look at your son!
All flour-faced!

127
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,803
I'm not in the mood!

128
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,472
I was hoping you were!

129
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,225
And my change?

130
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:38,229
- I need money for the cafeteria.
- Ask your dad

131
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,944
A storm's brewing!

132
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,822
- Papa, for the cafeteria...
- What?

133
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,657
I need 1,000 francs

134
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:53,453
Ya ask for 1,000 and hope for 500.
So ya only need 300

135
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,454
Here's 100

136
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,834
Take 500.
But your mom's supposed to pay that

137
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,377
The scissors!

138
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,671
Where are the scissors?

139
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,840
It's not funny!

140
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,510
No homework now! It's time to eat

141
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:14,640
Right! Each thing has its time and
place. That way, the cows're safe!

142
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,019
Is that a new pen?

143
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,646
I made a swap for it

144
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,024
You swap a lot lately!

145
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,490
What's that smell?

146
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,701
It's the fish

147
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,119
And how!

148
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,374
Ask your mom if her hot-pad is hot

149
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,834
Why?

150
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,961
For laughs!

151
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,731
You can clear the table now

152
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,818
Your cousin phoned.
His wife is expecting again

153
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,153
Her 4th in 3 years?

154
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,364
They're like rabbits. Disgusting!

155
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,076
And what about our kid
during vacation?

156
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,579
- Who're summer camps for?
- He'd have fun there

157
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,164
It's 8 months off!

158
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,917
Never too early to plan a vacation!

159
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,505
Don't pull so hard!

160
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,174
Great, huh?

161
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,676
Lions' Club...

162
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,177
What's all this?

163
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,054
Take it easy!

164
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,348
For Sunday's race...

165
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:41,185
shall I pick the Chevreuse Valley
or along the Oise?

166
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,979
On Sunday I rest

167
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,898
I'm going to see Huguette

168
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,984
But I'm the race organiser!

169
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,945
I'm sick of housework...

170
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,197
And dates in the afternoon!

171
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,825
I mean the edible kind!

172
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,369
What're you waiting for?
Go to bed!

173
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,373
G'night!

174
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,709
You can be so stupid!

175
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,045
If you could only take a joke...

176
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,881
Your auto races are a waste of time!

177
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,218
The garbage!
Lights out as soon as you're in bed!

178
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:18,556
I make contacts!
One day I'll be vice-president!

179
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,399
Hurry up! It's late!
I didn't hear the alarm

180
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,462
That I would have dirtied
the classroom walls!

181
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,134
There's no socks around these holes!

182
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,013
Buy a new pair!
The others are in the laundry

183
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,060
I gave you money for sheets
for the kid's bed

184
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,313
He prefers his sleeping bag

185
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,148
Right, honey?

186
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,776
At least I'm warm in it

187
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,653
You still here?

188
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,656
Bye, Pa! Mama!

189
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,662
Don't rush so fast!

190
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:09,166
We'll get locked out
and have to see the director

191
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,002
- No need to hurry!
- Why?

192
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,630
The prof said he won't let ya in

193
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,425
- He means it?
- He can't stand you

194
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,010
- Have you money?
- Yes for the canteen

195
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,179
Trust me... This way!

196
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,181
What'll we do now?

197
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,204
Follow me!

198
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,374
Put your satchel with mine

199
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,980
Antoine! He saw me!

200
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,482
- Which one's he?
- With dark hair

201
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,567
But he should be in school!

202
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,821
- You'll get it!
- She won't dare tell Dad

203
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,281
- And the guy?
- Never saw him before!

204
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,991
So you're safe!

205
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,188
I'm going to school tomorrow...

206
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,692
but I'll need an excuse.
How'll you manage?

207
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,196
I've got an old one.
I'll cut off the date

208
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,699
You can borrow it and copy it

209
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,617
But the handwriting?

210
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,411
Imitate your mother's

211
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,205
That'll be hard. It's angular

212
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,751
- Don't worry, it'll work.
- I hope so!

213
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,878
- Bye!
- Bye!

214
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,095
I ask you to please...

215
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,474
excuse...

216
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,018
my son...

217
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,526
René... who was ill...

218
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,737
My son René!

219
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,261
It smells like something burnt!

220
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,763
That's downstairs

221
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,598
Set the table just for 2

222
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,350
Why? Is Mom gone?

223
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:44,603
She phoned me to say
she'll be late tonight

224
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,481
Her boss needs her for the budget

225
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,611
So we'll cook
and have a man-to-man dinner

226
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,656
She mentioned
some eggs someplace

227
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,449
I know where they are

228
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,457
Did you study hard today?

229
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,460
What'd you do?

230
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,128
The hare

231
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,630
And the tortoise?

232
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,800
No, just questions about the hare

233
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,470
- Did you answer right?
- He didn't ask me

234
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,473
You've got to speak up!

235
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,767
If not, you're out of the race

236
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,062
You've got to take
the initiative in life

237
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,941
Have you thought
of your mother's birthday?

238
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,818
It's the 17th

239
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,487
I hope you'll give her something

240
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,490
You hear me?

241
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,827
I know what you think

242
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,330
She's been hard on you lately but...

243
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,333
she's a very nervous woman

244
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,836
Put yourself in her shoes!

245
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,840
She has her housework
plus an afternoon job

246
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,175
And this place is too tiny

247
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,138
But we'll move.
I got a lead on a new place

248
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,686
In an office
it's always the same story

249
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:11,148
Women are exploited
and can't defend themselves

250
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,068
But she loves you! Oh shit!

251
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,958
- Where'd you put my Michelin guide?
- I didn't touch it

252
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,878
You know I can't stand lying

253
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,716
I put it in its place yesterday

254
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,301
It's not me!

255
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,554
It's crazy how things disappear!

256
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,223
It's not me

257
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,896
I'll ask your mother

258
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,402
It's time for bed

259
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,572
Don't forget the garbage

260
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,131
My boss drove me home

261
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,093
Exactly! I couldn't say no to that

262
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,638
- Night work pays double.
- Wait'll ya see my pay!

263
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,224
That kind of overtime is paid cash!

264
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,311
No wonder
you need to rest on Sunday!

265
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,896
Where's my Michelin?

266
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,482
No idea! The kid might know

267
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,860
- He doesn't.
- He's a liar!

268
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,320
- Like you!
- If ya raised him right...

269
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,198
Shit! I gave him a name!
I feed him!

270
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:30,495
I'm sick of your complaints! Fed up!
If ya can't stand him, say so

271
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,831
We'll put him in an orphanage...

272
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,167
so I can have some peace!

273
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,563
We'll eat out
till the end of the month!

274
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,357
How? I don't have a clean shirt!

275
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,069
You could at least do the collars

276
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,072
You and your anti-foglight!
Just to show off!

277
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,948
I bought it second-hand

278
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,874
Go open the door

279
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,793
Maybe it's the gas man

280
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,128
They send a notice first

281
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,553
I'm in Antoine's class.
Is he any better?

282
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,514
Why?

283
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,809
He missed school yesterday

284
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,644
Ya hear that?

285
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,324
You don't seem surprised

286
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:53,078
Why should I be?
He's capable of anything

287
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,667
What'll my excuse be?

288
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,336
The bigger the lie,
the better it works

289
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,423
When Ma broke her leg,
I went back...

290
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,008
without an excuse

291
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,011
I can't make up a story like that

292
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,222
We mustn't go in together

293
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:13,932
Right. You go first

294
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,876
So there you are!

295
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,546
Extra homework made you sick, eh?

296
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,506
Your folks fell for it?

297
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,801
I'd like to see
what kind of excuse you have

298
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,387
- Let's have it.
- I don't have one

299
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,307
You expect to get away
with it like that?

300
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,225
It'd be too easy!

301
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,104
Sir, it's my mother

302
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,898
What about her?

303
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,482
She's just died

304
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,238
I'm sorry... I didn't know...

305
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,574
Was she ill?

306
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,034
Yes, sir

307
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:18,288
You could've told me.
You should confide in your teachers

308
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,416
Go join the others

309
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,637
And your excuse?

310
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,388
Never mind!

311
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:50,070
- 'Tis best a thorn in the wood...
- ...than in the ass!

312
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,157
If you'd wash your ears
you'd hear your prompter!

313
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,784
Up your'ear!

314
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,119
He's just trying to confuse me

315
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,706
- Enough! Continue...
- I'm all mixed up

316
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,627
Than in the flowers...

317
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,880
...the flowers.
'Tis best independence...

318
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,883
And incessant peril...

319
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,635
Than slavery...

320
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:21,226
In eternal April.
You're an eternal loafer! Sit down!

321
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,103
I knew it at home!

322
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,480
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir!

323
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,940
I'm sorry...

324
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,525
Simonot!

325
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,694
The Hare...

326
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,252
Sit down!

327
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,616
He must be punished
within the limits...

328
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,576
He's beyond all limits!

329
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:23,121
Only his parents
can deal with such a mistake

330
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,790
We'll settle this tonight at home!

331
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,133
What'll you do?

332
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:39,137
After this I can't live
with my parents any more

333
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,640
I've got to disappear

334
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,683
Mine've been through worse!

335
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,062
Yeah, but I want
to live my own life

336
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,147
I'll write them a letter

337
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,483
- Right now?
- It's best that way

338
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,151
Where'll ya sleep?

339
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,820
I don't know. I don't care

340
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,822
I've got an idea

341
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,492
Be at the Pigalle fountain
in 1 hour

342
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,826
OK

343
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,685
It's my uncle's old print shop

344
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,646
The floor collapsed
under the heavy machines

345
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,398
Will it collapse again?

346
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:39,364
It can't fall any lower.
You'll be warm here

347
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,630
A mattress...
This'll do for a pillow

348
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,050
It's real heavy!

349
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,888
Go for a walk till midnight

350
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,603
- Keep my satchel until tomorrow.
- OK

351
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:18,862
Dear Parents... I understand
the seriousness of my lie

352
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,698
Why'd he kill me instead of you?

353
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,825
A matter of preference!

354
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,119
Life between us is impossible

355
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,748
So I'm going to try my luck
in the city or elsewhere

356
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,750
I want to become a man

357
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,086
When I see you again,
we'll have a full explanation

358
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,464
I close with kisses... Antoine

359
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,426
- It's normal that he hates me?
- You're hard on him

360
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,303
He gets on my nerves!

361
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,788
- Can you help me catch him?
- Sure!

362
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,542
- Your sister?
- No, her dog got away

363
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,629
- It's a lost dog or hers?
- I don't know!

364
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,219
- May I help?
- Yes! The more, the better!

365
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,638
- What's his name?
- I've no idea

366
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,933
Forget it, kid

367
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,143
But I saw him first!

368
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,853
Understand me?

369
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,165
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir?

370
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:45,628
- Did things explode last night?
- No, everything was fine!

371
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,258
Parents spoil 'em rotten!

372
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,220
Chabrol, want some help?

373
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,936
The last question is even easier

374
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,036
as if you're lisping

375
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:24,125
I can't. Not everyone can use
their tongue like you said

376
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:28,838
Quiet!
S... Si... Go sit down!

377
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,133
Impudent!

378
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:36,012
Now you!

379
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,848
Answer me!

380
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,206
Doinel?

381
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,547
Frochot, take over until I return

382
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,390
We don't know how to handle him!

383
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,602
Madam, you don't deserve
such a rascal

384
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,896
My poor baby!

385
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,066
Where'd you spend the night?

386
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,069
- In a print shop.
- At a printer's?

387
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:36,405
I don't care if he's last
so long as he behaves!

388
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,907
Fine!

389
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,746
Maybe it's... glandular

390
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,805
You mustn't catch cold

391
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,308
And now to bed!

392
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,311
I'm not sleepy

393
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:11,566
You'll be better off in our bed

394
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,621
You know, I was your age once

395
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,498
Kids forget that!

396
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,459
I was stubborn
and wouldn't confide in my parents

397
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,837
So I wrote everything in a diary

398
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:37,258
Nobody's ever read it.
One day I'll show it to you

399
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:43,014
At your age I went on vacation
with a shepherd boy I liked but...

400
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:47,518
they caught us! Ma made me swear
not to see him again...

401
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:51,564
and never told Papa.
So I cried a lot but I obeyed her

402
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:56,235
We should always obey our mothers!
We can have secrets!

403
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,031
What did you mean in your letter...

404
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,575
about having a full explanation?

405
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:07,496
I meant about my bad behavior
and why I don't study hard

406
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,582
So, tell me...

407
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,667
I don't know how to listen...

408
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:14,587
so I want to quit
and earn my own living

409
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,840
That's crazy! You've no idea!

410
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:21,010
I so regret not going
beyond high school!

411
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,804
Your dad has only
an elementary diploma

412
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,598
It hampers him!

413
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,352
I know school
teaches lots of useless stuff

414
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,687
Algebra and science don't...

415
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,023
help many people

416
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,694
But French! You always need it
for writing letters!

417
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,864
Let's share another secret, OK?

418
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,954
On your next French essay...
if you're among...

419
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,666
the top 5,
I'll give you 1,000 francs!

420
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,378
But don't tell your father!

421
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,643
Suddenly the dying man
rose up on his fists...

422
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,481
and shot a lightning glance
at his terrified children

423
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,525
The hair at his nape moved.
His wrinkles quivered

424
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,486
His face brightened

425
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:47,990
A breath wafted his face, making it
sublime. He lifted his fist...

426
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,535
and shouted
Archimedes' famous word...

427
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:54,163
Eureka! I have found it!

428
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:12,306
Describe a major event you witnessed
and which concerned you personally

429
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,185
Eureka! I have found it!

430
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,357
The Death...

431
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,611
of My Grandfather

432
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:56,642
The monkey's finally laid
the new typist!

433
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,395
She's made the most of it!

434
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:03,566
She got herself named
executive secretary

435
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,570
She fills all the requirements!

436
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:11,407
Gotta be careful of her now
because of pillow talk!

437
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:16,203
When she was on the road, I told her
how to juggle her expense account

438
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,540
Instead of that,
she stayed in 3-star hotels!

439
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:24,503
Say, I still haven't found
my Michelin hotel guide

440
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,590
One of you has moved it

441
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,758
Oh, you and your Michelin!

442
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,219
I don't like mysteries

443
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:34,471
What's on the stove?

444
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,432
Nothing! I'm sure!

445
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,605
Put it out! Don't yell!

446
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,940
Get some water!

447
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,946
Ya blockhead!

448
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,783
What made ya
light a candle in there?

449
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,452
It was for Balzac!

450
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,997
Balzac? Ya take me for a fool?

451
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,459
- For my French essay!
- Yes, he promised me something

452
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,378
What? A bonus for fire damage?

453
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,547
Ya need more than a candle!

454
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,800
- Want my lighter?
- Don't be silly!

455
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,638
For as long as you're living here,
you'll do as I say!

456
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:18,140
If not, it means military academy!

457
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:21,644
Know what that is?
You'll find out!

458
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,646
And you'll toe the line!

459
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,982
Know what we'll do
for a change of air?

460
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:29,318
We'll all go to the movies tonight!

461
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:33,489
Fine! A great method of education!

462
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:37,159
- How's your French essay?
- Not bad

463
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:42,164
Listen, Julian... Trust us!

464
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,833
He wants to surprise us

465
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,920
- I don't like this!
- Take us to the movies?

466
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,506
- What's playing?
- Paris Is Ours

467
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,509
- If you're plotting...
- Rather not go?

468
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:57,721
Sure, I'll go!
I've worked hard. I deserve it!

469
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:01,976
But the Gaumont Theatre
doesn't like arsonists!

470
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:25,291
My ice cream bar was good!
I'd never had strawberry

471
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,251
They're not in season!

472
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:37,720
She really had... how shall I say...
she had lots of...

473
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,974
- That's all you ever notice!
- Lots of class!

474
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:49,565
- I liked that movie.
- Yeah, but it wasn't funny

475
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,235
Not funny? But it had depth!

476
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,404
- What?
- Depth!

477
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,741
- The movie!
- Yeah...

478
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,873
It's time for bed

479
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,750
Beddy-bye!

480
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,424
It's Satan's general and his staff!

481
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,888
Your mom's got nice legs, eh?

482
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:35,611
Back to our happy hearth...
but a little smoky!

483
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,072
The garbage, honey!

484
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:42,326
I hope I won't regret
trying to win him over

485
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,292
Doinel!

486
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:36,255
If your essay is first today
it's because I've decided...

487
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:39,675
to rank them
by starting from the bottom

488
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:43,595
Your search for the absolute
led you straight to a zero

489
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:46,223
For you who don't know Balzac...

490
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,351
it concerns A Gloomy Affair

491
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:52,396
Doinel has the right to take

492
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:55,649
the death of a relative
as his subject...

493
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,527
although we know
he easily sacrifices his dear ones

494
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,320
whenever convenient

495
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,072
I didn't copy, sir!

496
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,116
Listen to this!

497
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,952
Suddenly the dying man rose up...

498
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,289
and shot a lightning glance
at his terrified children

499
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:14,209
His hair stood on end
and his eyebrows arched

500
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,129
His face brightened
with a sublime look

501
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:22,593
He shouted Archimedes' famous
word... Eureka! I've found it!

502
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,636
Well, I found it too!

503
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,015
- You plagiarist!
- It's not true!

504
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,893
Take your essay at once
to the principal

505
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,644
Colombel, go with him

506
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,065
And stay out
till the end of the term!

507
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,746
What's with you?

508
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:55,083
I sat next to him.
He didn't copy it!

509
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,877
Want to be expelled?

510
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,170
That's OK

511
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,048
Such impudence!

512
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:05,093
- Get out!
- Expel me but don't kick me out!

513
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,428
Out!

514
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:08,263
That's illegal!

515
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:12,267
I'll show you
who makes the laws here!

516
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,112
Did you take him?

517
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,114
- He ran away.
- Ran away?

518
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,123
I slugged him and ran

519
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,961
And you?

520
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:42,130
He threw me out
till after Christmas

521
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:51,181
Now I really can't go home.

522
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,350
Dad said
he'd put me in an academy

523
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,645
- What's that?
- Something military

524
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,481
You'd have a uniform and a future

525
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,650
No thanks!

526
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,986
If only it were the Navy!

527
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,864
I'd like to see the ocean.

528
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,991
I've seen the Channel,
the Atlantic...

529
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,994
and the Mediterranean
but not the North Sea

530
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,663
Stay at my house. We'll manage!

531
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,734
Holy cow! A horse!

532
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:46,612
It's my dad's. A souvenir!

533
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,699
What a huge place!

534
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,537
Clean off the sofa.
You can sleep here

535
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,205
And your parents?

536
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,375
Never here! Mom drinks
and Dad is always...

537
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,045
at the races.
This place is wide open

538
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,047
We need to start a business

539
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,299
Yeah, we need money

540
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,551
But we need some to start with

541
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:11,386
In that case...

542
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,222
I'll use part of my inheritance

543
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,059
Quiet! Mom may be around

544
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,193
Anyone here?

545
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,529
- Hello, madam!
- Little devil!

546
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,394
- Seen your mother lately?
- Today after school

547
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,650
She makes sure
her hours never coincide with mine

548
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,902
She must be up to something

549
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:17,239
Where's the fruit?

550
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:42,764
Here!

551
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,978
Hurry up! We'll miss the news!

552
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:39,487
Yeah, I know, Inspector,
you'll lock me up for life

553
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:43,158
But drop by Duely's around 8:00

554
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,369
Ya might meet a pal
with sharp teeth

555
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,363
I'm thirsty!

556
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,035
It's already empty!

557
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:29,037
Come on! Play!

558
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,248
You threw a 12?

559
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,133
It's my old man!

560
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,552
Help shake the blankets!

561
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,229
That's enough!

562
01:02:57,232 --> 01:03:00,110
What's going on? It's a smokehouse!

563
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,070
A real gambling den!

564
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,740
I'll deduct 3 cigars
from your allowance

565
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:09,077
Bucephalus is not for your junk!

566
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:15,000
He's worth a million!
A work of art!

567
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,670
I'll never give him up
until the last minute!

568
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:23,091
Now turn out the lights
and go to sleep!

569
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,552
- 'Night, Pa!
- Goodnight!

570
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,270
- Not bad!
- By god!

571
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,067
Great!

572
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,447
Give me your Michelin

573
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,407
A million'd be great!

574
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:50,410
My dad would kill me
because of that horse

575
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:53,079
With a million
we'll find a beach...

576
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:55,999
open a boat business
and no one'll bother us!

577
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:57,644
- Make up your mind.
- Dad's office has some

578
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:01,314
- Don't back down!
- We can't sell it. They're numbered

579
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,858
- We won't sell it, we'll pawn it!
- Smart!

580
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,610
Ma pawned all our stuff

581
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,536
- How much?
- 10o/o

582
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,706
- 1,000 right away.
- When you come back!

583
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,708
You sure trust me!

584
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,912
Give us back our typewriter!
Runnin' away?

585
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:29,415
- I thought you'd gone this way.
- Sure!

586
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,084
They wouldn't take it!

587
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,752
Then give it back

588
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:36,798
- Gimme 500 for the time I spent.
- We're broke

589
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:39,926
Ya must have something!
300 and that'll do it

590
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,261
No! Give it back!

591
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,765
I don't work for free!
I'll keep it as a deposit

592
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,600
It's ours!

593
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,936
Give it back or I'll slug ya!

594
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:53,356
Hands off!
It's no more yours than it is mine!

595
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:57,193
- Let's ask that cop.
- Shut up!

596
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:02,448
Keep the damn thing! Shit-heads!

597
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,830
- I'm tired of carrying it!
- It's your turn

598
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,998
Dad'll surely think I swiped it

599
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:13,543
- It was your idea.
- Yours!

600
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,130
- I don't care. I quit!
- Ya lost your mind?

601
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:20,591
I gotta take it back
to Dad's office but...

602
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:25,388
I'll wear a hat. If the guard
sees me, he'll think it's a man

603
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:28,724
Take it back for me!

604
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,144
No way! It wasn't my idea!

605
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:32,979
You're a bastard!

606
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:34,814
I'll put my hat on

607
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:36,899
Wait for me by the store

608
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:15,021
Why, you're the Doinel boy!

609
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:19,192
Put that down!
Your papa's gonna love this!

610
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:23,863
And I get hell for not watching
things enough! This'll cost ya!

611
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,033
And don't try to pull
a Houdini on me!

612
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,453
I know the ropes!
I don't like smarties like you

613
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:35,875
Mr. Doinel? I'm sorry
to call during your meeting

614
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,378
You'll have to come upstairs

615
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:44,675
I got a surprise for you...
but not a nice one!

616
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,722
Don't touch that hat!

617
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:57,980
You think I'm takin' ya to a party?

618
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,901
The joke's over! Your ma and I
wanna be able to sleep nights

619
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:05,238
Take a good look at your pal

620
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,740
You won't see him for a while!

621
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:27,093
Maybe this'll set your head right.
It can't go on like this!

622
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,346
If I'd done this,
my dad would've laid me flat

623
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,600
Is the captain in?

624
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:43,860
We've tried everything...
kindness, persuasion, punishment...

625
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,028
but we've never beaten him!

626
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,197
At times the good old methods...

627
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,784
Yes, but we're not like that

628
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,912
- We left him free.
- Maybe too free!

629
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:56,414
I wouldn't say so

630
01:12:56,581 --> 01:13:00,084
But since we both work,
you know how it is

631
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,670
Yes, I'm a father too

632
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:05,214
At times it's hard
to know what to do

633
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,050
If only he'd confide in us!

634
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,511
We talk to him,
his mind's elsewhere

635
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,471
You think he's listening?

636
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,474
Look how I found him!

637
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,477
Who knows what's on his mind?

638
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:19,437
Cabanel!

639
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,983
Please take this boy's statement

640
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,527
- Vagrancy and theft!
- Right, boss

641
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:28,321
Come on!

642
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,828
So what's your decision?

643
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:40,499
For now, we can't have him at home.
He'd run off again

644
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,961
If you could put him somewhere
under surveillance...

645
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:46,714
like in the country
and put him to work

646
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:49,008
He won't do anything in school

647
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,677
We could try
an Observation Center

648
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:55,514
They're well organized now,
with wood and metal workshops

649
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,350
That would do him good

650
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,186
If they have room!

651
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:04,690
You'll have ask
for a paternal correction...

652
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:08,694
so Probational Education
can take charge of him

653
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:12,365
He'll go before
the juvenile court judge tomorrow

654
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:16,744
- You or your wife should be there.
- Alright!

655
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,414
- Anyone see you enter the building?
- No

656
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,541
...hereby...

657
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:26,837
declares he entered the building
surreptitiously...

658
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:36,722
...one typewriter

659
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,228
Sign here!

660
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,397
- Charles!
- Yeah?

661
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,065
He's yours!

662
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,566
Come on!

663
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,154
That way!

664
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,125
- He's yours. I'm goin' home.
- OK

665
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:42,371
- What'd you do?
- Ran away from home

666
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,041
And you?

667
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,585
Me...

668
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,505
The gals're here!

669
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:41,347
I've seen cleaner precincts
in movies

670
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,517
I've seen dirtier

671
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,393
I've seen cheerier!

672
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,275
Move!

673
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:33,232
The chariot's here!

674
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,085
Put on your jacket!

675
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:54,039
Tie, belt, shoelaces...
Empty your pockets!

676
01:19:58,043 --> 01:19:59,378
Sign there!

677
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,402
Sign here!

678
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:10,486
We could try taking him back but...

679
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,405
he'd have to promise
to change completely

680
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,991
If you could frighten him...

681
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:17,242
That's not my role

682
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:19,411
We've no control over him!

683
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:23,081
Maybe you try to control him
only intermittently

684
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,460
Is the boy often left alone
on the weekends...

685
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:27,794
at home?

686
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,422
My husband belongs
to a car racing club

687
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:33,258
So we sometimes leave
the boy at home...

688
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:36,512
but he hates sports!
He prefers going...

689
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:38,889
to movies and ruining his eyes

690
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,475
And your husband? He's his son!

691
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:47,189
No. He married me
when the boy was a baby

692
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:48,941
Very honorable!

693
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,443
I shouldn't have said that

694
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:55,781
On the contrary!
I think it's best we send the boy...

695
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:57,950
to an observation center

696
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,244
One near the seashore?

697
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:03,622
We don't run vacation camps!

698
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:07,084
I'll do my best
with whatever is available

699
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:11,129
We'll keep him 2 or 3 months
while I investigate his case

700
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,173
Then we'll reach a decision

701
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,301
This processing is bound
to do him good

702
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:18,804
- Goodbye, Judge.
- Goodbye, Madam

703
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:26,853
Juvenile Delinquency Center

704
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:04,808
- What're you in for?
- And you?

705
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:08,061
- I slipped up!
- I swiped a typewriter

706
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:10,814
A typewriter? Not very bright!

707
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:14,568
They've all got serial numbers!

708
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:16,737
See that big guy?

709
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,740
He swiped automobile tires

710
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:22,826
At home every time I'd cry...

711
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:26,079
my dad would imitate my crying
with his violin...

712
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,914
just to tease me

713
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:31,710
One day I got fed up
and I slugged him

714
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:34,588
I'd kill my old man if he did that

715
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:39,926
Who's that guy?

716
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:43,430
He ran away last week.
He got caught!

717
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:49,144
Running away's not forbidden,
but getting caught is!

718
01:25:57,444 --> 01:25:59,112
What's going on?

719
01:25:59,446 --> 01:26:01,281
Line up!

720
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:03,116
What're you up to?

721
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,012
Show me your bread!

722
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,515
Alright...

723
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:11,017
You bit into yours!

724
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,687
Bring your bread and dish over here

725
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:26,700
Left or right?

726
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,378
Quiet!

727
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:51,725
I bet you'd get caught and I won!

728
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,691
I don't care!
For 5 days I had so much fun...

729
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,402
I'll do it again first chance I get

730
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:04,070
What're you up to?

731
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,534
Kanayan! To the psychologist!

732
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:12,829
If she drops a pencil,
pick it up...

733
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:16,249
without looking at her legs
or it'll go in your file

734
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:19,586
- What file?
- It says what they think of you...

735
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:22,881
the judge, doctor,
even your parents' neighbors

736
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:24,925
I know my file by heart

737
01:28:25,592 --> 01:28:29,763
I'm psychomotorally unstable
with perverse tendencies

738
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,932
What if I say some nonsense?

739
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:36,645
You'll go to the booby hatch and
that'll send you around the bend!

740
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:44,778
Why'd you return the typewriter?

741
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:48,615
I couldn't sell it.
I didn't know what to do

742
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:52,035
I was scared... so I took it back

743
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,870
I don't know why

744
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:57,624
And you stole 10,000 francs
from your grandmother?

745
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,126
She asked me over for her birthday

746
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,629
She was old and didn't eat much

747
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:06,967
She hung on to her money but
didn't need it. She was gonna die

748
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,679
I knew the hiding place
so I swiped some

749
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,807
I knew she'd never miss it

750
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,976
And she never did!

751
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:19,145
She gave me
a very nice book that day

752
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:24,317
My mother would always
go through my pockets and...

753
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:26,987
my pants were on the bed
that night...

754
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:30,156
so she came in
and swiped the money...

755
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,576
'cause the next day it was gone

756
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:37,122
Then she made me confess
I'd taken it from my grandma

757
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:40,959
So she took away the book
Grandma had given me

758
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:43,879
One day I asked to read it and...

759
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:46,715
found out she'd sold it

760
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,844
Your parents say you always lie

761
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,681
I lie... once in a while

762
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:58,935
At times, if I told the truth
they wouldn't believe me!

763
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,854
So I tell lies

764
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:03,231
Why don't you love your mother?

765
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:06,234
At first I was placed
with a foster mother

766
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:09,321
When the money ran out,
I went to Grandma's

767
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:13,366
Then she got old
and couldn't keep me so...

768
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:16,870
I went to live with my folks
but I was already 8

769
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:20,040
I realized Mom didn't like me much

770
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:24,210
She'd nag at me
for little insignificant things

771
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:30,216
Then there were fights at home

772
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:33,053
I heard...

773
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:40,435
that when my mother had me
she was a bachelor mother

774
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:45,315
Once she fought with Grandma
and I found out...

775
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:48,735
she wanted an abortion

776
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:51,196
So I was born thanks to Grandma

777
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:53,573
Have you ever slept with a girl?

778
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:02,207
No, but I know some pals
who have and they said...

779
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:05,502
if I really wanted to,
I should go to rue St-Denis

780
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:07,420
So I went and...

781
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:11,049
asked a few girls
and they gave me hell

782
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,051
I got scared and left

783
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:15,387
But I went back a few times

784
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:19,641
A guy noticed me in the street
and said What're you doin' here?

785
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:25,563
He was a North African. I explained
and he said he knew one who'd go...

786
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:31,611
with young guys and all that

787
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,282
He took me to her hotel...

788
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:38,743
but she wasn't there that day

789
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:43,039
We waited an hour or 2...
then I left

790
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,349
No, I came alone

791
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:44,893
That way?

792
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:12,712
Your personal letter
hurt your father a lot

793
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:16,007
You're naïve to think
he wouldn't show it to me

794
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:18,676
In spite of things
we're a solid couple

795
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:22,722
I've known hard times but it wasn't
smart to remind him about it

796
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:24,557
Didn't he give you a name?

797
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:28,728
We were ready...

798
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:32,649
to take you back home
but now it's impossible...

799
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:35,819
due to the gossip
and your talk to the neighbors

800
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:37,987
I didn't say a thing!

801
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:41,991
But I'm used to it! I've had idiots
attacking me all my life

802
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:44,577
That's all I have to say to you

803
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:46,454
Don't play the martyr!

804
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:51,292
Your father says
he doesn't care what happens to you

805
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:54,963
You can go to a trade school

806
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:57,215
You wanted a job?

807
01:33:57,382 --> 01:34:00,051
You'll see how much fun
a foundry can be!

808
01:39:17,577 --> 01:39:20,538
