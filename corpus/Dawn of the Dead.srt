1
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,220
You all right?

2
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,810
Shit's really hitting the fan.

3
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,890
<i>What difference does it make?</i>

4
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,270
<i>- That's a different study.
But if we knew that-</i>

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,020
<i>We don't know that.
We don't know that.</i>

6
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,190
<i>We've gotta operate
on what we do know.</i>

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,940
I'm still dreaming.

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,490
No, you're not.

9
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,070
<i>It's human beings
whose lives we're trying to save.</i>

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,780
My turn with the coat.

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,870
<i>I try to explain several times.</i>

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,000
The guys on the crew are going crazy.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,790
A couple of them
have flown the coop already.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,880
I don't know how long
we're gonna stay on the air.

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,720
Who's on camera?
Who the hell's on camera?

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,840
Who the hell's on camera two,
a blind man?

17
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,970
Roll the rescue-
Roll the rescue stations.

18
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,230
We just got a report that half those
stations have been knocked out.

19
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,400
Get me another list.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,190
Sure, I'll just pull it out of my ass, right?

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
<i>- Believe the dead are returning to life?
- I'm not...</i>

22
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,190
You believe the dead are returning
to life and attacking the living?

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,030
I'm not so sure what to believe, doctor.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,870
All we get is what you people tell us,
it's hard enough to believe...

25
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,030
It's fact. It's fact.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,370
It's hard enough to believe
without you coming in here-

27
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,120
You're not running a talk show here,
Mr. Berman.

28
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,750
You can forget pitching an audience
the moral bullshit they wanna hear.

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,380
<i>You're talking about
abandoning human...</i>

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,220
Frannie, get the list of rescue stations.
Charlie's receiving on the emergencies.

31
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,220
Rescue stations?

32
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,270
Half of those are inoperative as of now.

33
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,890
Charlie, these are rescue stations.

34
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,270
We can't send people
in inoperative rescue stations.

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,400
We've had old information on the air
for the last 12 hours.

36
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,910
- Kill those old ones.
- Givens wants them.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,120
Kill them, Dick. Tell Givens to see me.

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,170
You have not listened.

39
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,590
You have not listened in the situation
for three weeks.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,010
What does it take?

41
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,220
What does it take to make people see?

42
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,520
People aren't willing to accept
your solutions, doctor.

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,060
And I, for one, don't blame them.

44
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,440
Every dead body that is not exterminated
becomes one of them.

45
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,440
Il gets up and kills.

46
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,280
The people it kills get up and kill.

47
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,200
Operative rescue stations.

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,070
Dan!

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,460
Yeah, that's the one, kid. Type that up.

50
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,630
They're dropping like flies.
I think Foster's right. We're losing it.

51
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,170
We're blowing it ourselves.

52
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,210
What's going on?
Who killed those supers?

53
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,630
I didn't order to do that.

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,880
Garrett, who told you
to kill those supers?

55
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,220
Nobody, I killed them.
They're out of date.

56
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,350
- Do you know you're on the air?
- What is going on?

57
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,930
I want those supers on the air
all the time.

58
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,060
Without those rescue situations on-screen
every minute, people won't watch us.

59
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,310
They'll tune out.

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,900
You willing to murder people
by sending them to stations...

61
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,110
...that have closed down?

62
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,320
I want that list up on the screen
every minute that we're on the air.

63
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,820
Anybody need a ride?
- What the hell are you doing?

64
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,240
Get back here on this console.

65
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,580
What is this, the news show
or a football game?

66
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,750
Get that idiot off the air!

67
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,830
This is supposed to be a doggone
news television show!

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,710
Officer, stop those men.

69
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,500
Lucas, get back here on the console!

70
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,420
Damn.

71
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,380
Get somebody in here
who can run this thing.

72
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,180
Get that fucking idiot off the air!

73
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,680
Get someone. Triple pay!

74
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,720
We're staying on the air!

75
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,270
My God. Turn it off!

76
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,190
Dr. Foster, so what's the facts?
The public needs facts.

77
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,480
What do you have to give us?

78
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,820
They kill for one reason.
They kill for food.

79
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,280
They eat their victims.
Do you understand that, Mr. Berman?

80
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,860
That's what keeps them going.

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,370
If we'd listened, if we'd dealt
with this phenomenon properly...

82
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,830
...without emotion, without emotion,
it wouldn't have come to this.

83
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,710
There is a martial law state
in effect in Philadelphia...

84
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,590
...as in all other major cities
in the country,

85
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,050
Hold it, friend. Need a badge.

86
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,220
Hey, what's going on?

87
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,550
It's just crazy.

88
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,100
Here.

89
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,810
Jim, you take it.

90
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,400
It is the order of the OEP by command
of the federal government...

91
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,570
...the president of the United States.

92
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,910
Citizens may no longer occupy
private residences...

93
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,990
...no matter how safely protected
or well-stocked.

94
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,370
The dead body must be exterminated
either by destroying the brain...

95
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,830
...or severing the brain
from the rest of the body.

96
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,210
Should we be unable to change...

97
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,760
Frannie, meet me on the roof at 9:00.
We're getting out.

98
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,130
- I don't believe this, what...?
- Get out in the chopper.

99
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,930
David, we can't, we've got...

100
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,550
Is 9 p. m. all right?

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,640
- Stephen, we can't. We've got to-
- We've got to nothing, Fran.

102
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,060
We've got to survive.
Somebody's got to survive.

103
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,020
Now, you be upstairs at 9:00,
and don't make me come looking for you.

104
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,190
Go ahead. We'll be off the air
by midnight anyway.

105
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,280
The emergency networks
are taking over.

106
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,530
Our responsibility is finished.

107
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,450
Moved in the central areas of the city.

108
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,080
The bodies of the dead
will be delivered over...

109
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,830
...to specially equipped squads
of the national guard...

110
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,540
Martinez.

111
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,880
You know we've got this building
surrounded.

112
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,300
Little bastard's got them moved
into one building. Dumb little bastard.

113
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,010
- Come on.
Martinez.

114
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,470
The people in this project
are your responsibility.

115
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,810
We don't want any of them hurt.

116
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,770
There were no charges
against you or any of your people.

117
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,610
Yet.

118
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,980
Come on, Martinez,

119
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,490
Yeah, Martinez,
show your greasy little Puerto Rican ass...

120
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,900
...so I can blow it right off.

121
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,740
Blow all their asses off,
lowlife bastards.

122
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,580
Blow all their lowlife little Puerto Rican
and nigger asses right off,

123
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,830
- You're Rod, right?
- Rod Tucker.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,040
How the hell come we stick
these lowlife bastards...

125
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,210
...in these big ass fancy hotels anyway?

126
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,630
Shit, man. This is better than I got.

127
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,590
Hey, you ain't gonna talk them
out of here.

128
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,140
- You gotta blow them out.
- Just stay cool, okay?

129
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,260
When we go in there, don't pop off,
all right?

130
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,430
I'll be okay.

131
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,480
Come on, let's get on with it.
This is a waste of my time.

132
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,020
Let's go, let's go!

133
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,860
Jesus Christ.

134
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,530
Move in. Move in.

135
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,690
Goddamn it.

136
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,660
Come on, you dumb bastards.
Come and get them.

137
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,050
Rico, look out!

138
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,650
Hold it.

139
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,570
Don't go out there!

140
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,490
<i>Gas. Gas.</i>

141
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,160
Masks.

142
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,120
Masks for gas. Masks for gas.
Down there.

143
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,080
Come on, work yourselves down.
One floor at a time. Deep down here.

144
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,420
- Hands up.
- Damn.

145
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,470
Steve, don't go!

146
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,260
No, let me go!

147
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,810
Come on, you little bastards, ha, ha.

148
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,110
Wooley's gone ape shit, man.

149
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,950
- Woo ley!
- He-he-he-hey.

150
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,450
Give me a hand here, man.

151
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,790
Yah!

152
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,790
What the hell, man?! Leave me alone!

153
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,210
Give me a hand, somebody!

154
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,960
Don't do anything, man.

155
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,970
Goddamn it. Help me, he's crazy.

156
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,180
Step away from him.

157
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,140
Not that room. Not that room.

158
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,670
Do that again.

159
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,340
Come on.

160
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,550
Jesus Christ.

161
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,680
Come on, come on,
You don't want to see that.

162
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,020
Shoot it, man.

163
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,440
Shoot it, man.
Shoot it in the head.

164
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,290
<b>No! No!</b>

165
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,910
Miguel.

166
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,500
Miguel. Miguelito.

167
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,430
Watch out for the girl.

168
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,970
For chrissakes, stand clear.

169
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,440
Oh, no, please. No, no, please.

170
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,960
You ain't just in here
by yourself, boy.

171
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,550
You was in Wooley's unit, wasn't you?

172
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
I didn't see nothing.

173
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,970
I didn't see how he died.

174
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,590
Mao, there's a lot of people
who were running out.

175
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,810
I could run.

176
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,060
I could run right tonight.

177
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,120
Friend of mine's got this helicopter.

178
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,410
He asked me to come with him.

179
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
Think it's right to run?

180
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,220
Setters, please let me pass.

181
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,720
Let's get him to the medics.

182
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,220
No, no, please.

183
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,350
Just let me pass.

184
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,440
I go up to seventh floor to find my sister.

185
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,570
Just let me pass.

186
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,110
The people of 107 will do
what you wish now.

187
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,000
Many have died last week
on these streets.

188
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,460
In the basement of this building,
you'll find them.

189
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,840
I have given them the last rites.

190
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,170
Now, you do what you will.

191
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,430
You are stronger than us.

192
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,800
But soon, I think they be stronger
than you.

193
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:49,730
When the dead walk, senores,
we must stop the killing...

194
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,280
...or we lose the war,

195
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,480
Hurry, get up! Get it off!

196
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,430
Jesus Christ.

197
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,900
Hey, you okay down there?

198
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,230
Yeah.

199
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,070
This must be
where they dumped them in, huh?

200
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,900
- You need more men?
- No, it's all done, man.

201
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,070
It's all been done.

202
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,830
Jesus Christ.

203
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,250
Why did these people keep them here?

204
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,590
Because they still believe
there's respect in dying.

205
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,930
<i>...captain.</i>

206
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,810
<i>Moving on the top fl...</i>

207
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,440
<i>The line's not coming in at all.</i>

208
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,730
Hello, HQ, this is police dock.

209
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,990
Operator dead. Post abandoned.

210
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,120
Stephen.

211
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,240
I hope that's Roger.

212
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,460
You guys okay?

213
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,630
Who's he?

214
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,130
His name is Peter. He's all right.

215
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,510
Come on, let's hustle.

216
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,140
Hey, you guys,
you better get a move on.

217
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,180
There's a report at the dock's
being knocked out.

218
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,890
Right. The left squad.

219
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,520
Can we carry the extra weight?

220
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,060
A little harder on the fuel,
but we'll be okay.

221
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,320
Hey, you got any cigarettes?

222
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,150
Any of you guys got cigarettes?

223
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,410
No, sorry.

224
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,780
Where you headed?

225
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,160
Downriver.

226
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,500
We got an idea.
Maybe we can make it to the islands.

227
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,790
What islands?

228
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,630
Any island.

229
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,710
What about you? Where you headed?

230
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,170
Straight up.

231
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,270
Have you got any cigarettes?

232
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,400
I never had a cigarette.
Did any of you guys got cigarettes?

233
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,260
Is he your man?

234
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,800
Most of the time, yeah.

235
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,010
Just like to know who everybody is.

236
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,470
Yeah, me too.

237
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,240
Got any more water?

238
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,160
You know where we are?

239
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,580
Yeah, I know exactly where we are.

240
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,040
Harrisburg?

241
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,330
Passed it about an hour ago.

242
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,220
Jesus. It's everywhere.

243
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,140
We're still pretty close to Johnstown.

244
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,480
Those rednecks are probably enjoying
the whole thing.

245
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,610
What are you looking at?

246
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,110
Happy hunting.

247
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,780
I heard there about
ten or 12 down in the woods.

248
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,620
I got at least 14 shells...

249
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,460
I got a couple extra boxes
in case they come around later on.

250
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,290
Look out, behind you.

251
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,160
Get down, get down. Get out of the way!

252
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,670
There, by the old car.

253
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,670
Hit the gas tank.

254
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,430
Shit.

255
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,850
<b>Ah.</b>

256
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,020
Eh, got him.

257
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,400
Ah, missed.

258
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,110
Got the bitch.

259
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,270
Ah, shit, man, damn near empty.

260
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,180
I got this one.

261
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,900
There's a lot of private planes
in farm country like this.

262
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,940
I guess they all hit the pumps
and they took off,

263
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,320
Yeah, to where?

264
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,730
I got some here.

265
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,200
- Can you handle that?
- Yeah, I got it.

266
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,240
I'm gonna see what's left
in the hangars.

267
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,960
Bunch of junk.

268
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,860
Stephen?

269
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,450
Run! Run!

270
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,660
Run!

271
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,500
Run!

272
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,790
<b>Oh.</b>

273
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,610
Run.

274
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,630
Roger!

275
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,680
It's all right. It's okay. It's all right.

276
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,520
Peter!

277
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,520
Son of a bitch.

278
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,830
You never aim a gun at anyone, mister.

279
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,380
Peter!

280
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,500
Scary, isn't it?

281
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,640
Isn't it?

282
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,850
We gotta find fuel.
Maybe closer to Cleveland.

283
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,900
No, we gotta stay out of the big cities.

284
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,070
If it's like Philly,
we may never get out alive.

285
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,190
We may never get out
of any place alive.

286
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,780
We almost didn't get out of here.

287
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,570
We're getting out of here fine.

288
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,240
As long as there's not many
of those around, we can handle them.

289
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,450
Yeah, well, it wasn't those things
that nearly blew me away.

290
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,540
We gotta stay in the sticks.

291
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,330
I mean, there's bound to be more
private airports upstate.

292
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,880
There's the locks along the Allegheny.
Fuel stations there, state, private.

293
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,710
Those are probably still manned.
We don't need those hassles either.

294
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,390
- They're just out after scavengers, looters.
- You got papers for this limousine?

295
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,220
I got GON ID. So does Fran.

296
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,890
Right, and we're out
doing traffic reports.

297
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,350
Wake up, sucker.

298
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,640
We're thieves and we're bad guys.
That's exactly what we are.

299
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,400
We gotta find our own way.

300
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,020
We don't even know
where we're going.

301
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,820
We don't have food, we don't have water.
We don't even have a radio.

302
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,570
Stephen, you need to get some sleep.

303
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,040
What the hell is it?

304
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:27,010
Looks like a shopping center,
one of those big indoor malls.

305
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Oh, my God.

306
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,760
No chance. Let's get out of here.

307
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,720
- Wait a minute. They can't get up here.
We can't go down there.

308
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,970
Let's check it out.

309
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,000
Most of the gates are down.
I don't think they can get into the stores.

310
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,460
I haven't seen any of them
up on the second floor.

311
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,000
The big department stores
usually use both floors.

312
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,500
If we can get in up top...

313
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,760
Okay.

314
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,440
Guess the power's not off in this area.
Could be nuclear.

315
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,030
What are they doing?
Why do they come here?

316
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,280
Some kind of instinct.

317
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,240
Memory of what they used to do.

318
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,410
This was an important place
in their lives.

319
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,700
Hey, look at this.

320
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,040
This doesn't go down into the mall.

321
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,880
What the hell is this?

322
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,970
How do we get down there?

323
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,090
Come down. Come on, drop.

324
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,100
There, let's go.

325
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,270
Looks like a free lunch.

326
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,810
"SPAM."

327
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,940
Did you bring a can opener?

328
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,440
No, I guess I didn't.

329
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,570
Then don't knock it. It's got its own key.

330
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,620
What do you think?

331
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,540
This is the only way up here.
What do you think?

332
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,980
No, thanks.

333
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,780
You better get some sleep too, buddy.

334
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,410
There's an awful lot of stuff down there
that we could use.

335
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:31,290
- I know it.
- It's a big place.

336
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,800
But they're pretty spread out
down there.

337
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,050
I think we can outrun them.

338
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,010
- Hit and run?
- Hit and run.

339
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,390
You're crazy.

340
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,430
This place could be a gold mine.
We gotta at least check it out.

341
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,350
This is exactly what we're trying
to get away from. Look what...

342
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,150
- Stephen.
- Leave him be. We're going ourselves.

343
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,270
That's ready to shoot. Be careful.

344
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,860
The trigger squeezes real easy.

345
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,700
But the weapon will kick you good
when it fires. Be ready for that.

346
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,870
Anyone but us comes up them stairs,
you guys take off in the machine.

347
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,330
You'll probably hear some shooting.
Just don't panic, okay?

348
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,490
Here.

349
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,020
Keys to the kingdom.

350
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,360
Grab the walkie-talkies.

351
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,790
Fifteen upper and lower,

352
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,830
Right here.

353
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,630
How about a little music?

354
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,290
- What?
- Might cover the noise we make.

355
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,090
Hit them all. Might as well
have power in everything.

356
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,800
We might need it.

357
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,830
Jesus Christ.

358
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,380
Stephen? Stephen.

359
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,760
What do you think,
bag it or try for it?

360
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,730
- You game?
- I need lighter fluid.

361
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,390
You got it.

362
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,780
Jesus Christ. They're maniacs.

363
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,830
Wait.

364
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,090
All right.

365
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,180
Come on.

366
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,270
Stephen, don't go down there.

367
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,600
Why? What's the matter?

368
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,610
Won't open.

369
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
Not working.

370
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,440
- To the right.
- Let's go.

371
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,090
Come on.

372
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,130
Come on, don't give in.

373
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,970
Don't open the door, Come on, let up.

374
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,860
Let it go, Take care of the other one.

375
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,830
Stephen, for God's sake.

376
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,990
Let's get up to the roof.

377
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,540
We can't leave those guys down there.

378
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,620
Well, we're in. Now how the hell
are we gonna get back?!

379
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,880
Who the hell cares?
Let's go shopping first!

380
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,420
Whoo!
Ah!

381
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,630
Watches. Watches.

382
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
Hey, hey, hey,
let's get the stuff we need.

383
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,340
I'll get a television and a radio.

384
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,600
Oh, lighter fluid,
and chocolates, chocolates.

385
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
Okay.

386
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,180
Whoo!
Oh, I'm gonna need a coat.

387
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,150
Why not? It's about time.
Whoo!

388
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,250
Hey, man, we can't carry all that shit.

389
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,720
Oh, I see, we're gonna just wheel
right by them.

390
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,970
We gonna try, brother.

391
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,220
We ain't doing this for the exercise.
We might as well try to get what we can.

392
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,810
No way this is gonna happen.

393
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,990
Hey, Peter!

394
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,370
Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

395
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,630
All right, let's go, brother.
The old okeydoke.

396
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,470
- Okay.
- All right.

397
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,430
Hey, hey, ugly.

398
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,260
Let's raise some hell. Hey, hey.

399
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,720
- Come here, chump. Come here.
- Come on.

400
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,930
Hey, hey.

401
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,270
Hey, come on!

402
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,270
- Come on over here.
- Over here, that's right.

403
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,230
Come on, come on, come on.

404
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,900
Come here.

405
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,030
Come on.
Come here. Whoo, whoo, whoo.

406
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,410
- All right, come on.
- Hey, hey, hey.

407
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,490
Come on, over here.

408
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,580
Just give it time. Give it time.

409
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,480
Okay, they're coming.

410
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,310
Go on up. Stay out of sight.

411
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,860
Let me know when it's clear enough.

412
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,990
- Okay.
- Okay.

413
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,870
Come to papa. That's it, keep coming.
Keep coming.

414
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,790
Good, good, good.

415
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,500
- Peter, it's good. Let's do it.
- Is it clear?

416
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,500
Not altogether,
but they're spread out good.

417
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,340
I think we can move the wagon.

418
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,840
<i>I'm coming.</i>

419
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,590
What the hell is that?

420
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,880
I don't know. Fuzz maybe?

421
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,590
- Maybe flyboy. Where's it coming from?
- Don't know. I can't tell.

422
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,520
Come on. Open up.

423
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,270
- Maybe I ought to go with you.
- Open up, I can get the wagon over.

424
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
If it's flyboy, let's get him on our side.

425
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,820
Okay.

426
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,360
Just cover me good, you hear?

427
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,280
You got it.

428
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,440
Hold it, flyboy.

429
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,110
Don't go into the stairway.

430
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,200
Don't open that door, baby.
You'll lead them right up with you.

431
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,870
Run for it. Run this way.

432
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:17,370
That's it, come on. Run, run, run.

433
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,830
Come on. All right, all right, all right.

434
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:25,550
Now head for the department store. Go.

435
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,400
Come on, come on,

436
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,410
Okay, downstairs again, same trick.
Let's go.

437
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,650
What do we do?
- Let them know we're here.

438
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,240
Come on, let's go. Over here.

439
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,120
You did all right this time, flyboy.
How about it?

440
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,420
Over here.

441
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,630
Come on.

442
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:45,400
<i>Now this is time to save shoppers...</i>

443
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,520
<i>...with our weekend sale-o-rama.</i>

444
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,690
<i>Chairs sold with sectional love seats
all reduced.</i>

445
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:55,700
<i>- This week's major offer...
- Jesus Christ.</i>

446
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,240
<i>...is a contemporary dining room set
with a 40-by-60 burlap tablecloth...</i>

447
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:10,710
<i>Why pay more
when the sales are often right here?</i>

448
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,970
- We'll have a hell of a time getting back.
- We gotta wait before we move.

449
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,890
No. There's always a chance of some
of them staying up on the balcony.

450
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,800
We can handle that. Break through them.

451
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:21,890
If any of them see us or hear us,
they'll just follow us on up.

452
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,060
It's no good.

453
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:27,230
We sure in hell can outrun them. Load up
what we got and get the hell out of here.

454
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,520
I've been thinking...

455
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,730
...maybe we got
a good thing going here.

456
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,740
Maybe we shouldn't be
in such a hurry to leave.

457
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,990
Oh, man.

458
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,780
If we can get back up there,
without them catching on...

459
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,490
...we can hold up for a while.

460
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,540
At least long enough to catch a breath.

461
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,540
Check out the radio.
See what's happening.

462
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:47,580
There's some kind of passageway
over the tops of these stores.

463
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,590
I don't know if it's just heating ducts
or some kind of access.

464
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,550
I saw it on a map.

465
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,510
Upstairs. Let's go.

466
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,730
These are just lighting fixtures.

467
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,770
No, it's got to be in this area.
It's on the map.

468
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,650
Elevator shaft.

469
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:24,290
Hold the doors.

470
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,300
It's here.

471
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,010
Get me a screwdriver and something
to stand on from down there.

472
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,390
<b>Uh, I know where the tools are.
Why don't you grab that stool over there?</b>

473
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,400
It's all right. We can get it off.

474
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,650
You found it, fly boy.

475
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:00,160
One-stop shopping. Everything you need
right at your fingertips.

476
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,030
Phillips.
- Here you go,

477
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,840
Stephen?

478
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,700
Sweet Jesus.

479
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,740
I've seen it. Come on.

480
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:47,160
Don't shoot.
They'll hear you downstairs.

481
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,740
Looks like we're gonna be okay.

482
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:36,080
You should see all the great stuff we got,
Frannie. All kinds of stuff.

483
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,330
This place is terrific.

484
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,790
It really is. It's perfect.

485
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,040
All kinds of things.

486
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:46,050
We really got it made here, Frannie.

487
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,060
What the hell time is it, anyway?

488
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:02,400
Not quite 9.

489
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,570
And nothing?

490
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:07,440
As long as we're getting the pattern,
that must mean they're sending the signal.

491
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,460
<i>No longer
seek occupancy in private residences...</i>

492
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:27,760
<i>...no matter how safe
or well-protected they may be.</i>

493
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:32,090
<i>The president today
has sent to Congress...</i>

494
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,930
<i>...a package of initiatives...</i>

495
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,270
<i>...aimed at what sources call
a most sweeping set...</i>

496
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,640
She all right? She looks blown.

497
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,980
- What do you expect?
- No, I mean she really looks sick.

498
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,940
- Physically.
- She's pregnant.

499
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,570
<i>That communications with Detroit...</i>

500
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:48,780

<i>...along with Atlanta, Boston...</i>

502
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:53,620
Well, how far along?

503
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,120
Three and a half, four months.

504
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,280
Jesus.

505
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,290
Maybe we should try to get moving.

506
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,460
We can deal with it.

507
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,460
Yeah, but maybe she needs
a doctor or something.

508
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,130
We can deal with it.
Doesn't change a thing.

509
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,170
<i>MAN... sections
of Philadelphia and New York City.</i>

510
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,340
You wanna get rid of it?

511
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:10,970
Huh?

512
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,760
Do you want to abort it?

513
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,850
It's not too late. And I know how.

514
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,100

00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:51,340
<i>...today issued a strong denial
that troubles...</i>

523
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:52,880
All your decisions made?

524
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,100
Do you wanna abort it?

525
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,270
Do you?

526
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:07,520
Somebody better sit watch all the time.

527
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:10,360
- They'll never get through there.
- Enough of them will.

528
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:13,900
And it ain't just them things
we got to worry about.

529
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,240
That chopper up there
could give us away...

530
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,870
...if somebody comes messing around.

531
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,620
What are they gonna do?
Land another pilot to fly it out?

532
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,710
They're not gonna mess with a little bird
like that. They got enough on their hands.

533
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,040
So I guess we forget about Canada,
right?

534
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:31,880
Nobody cares about my vote, huh?

535
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,380
Oh, come on, Fran.
I thought you were sleeping.

536
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:44,390
Damn it, Fran.

537
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,780
You were the one
that wanted to set up house.

538
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:04,410
<i>The normal question,
the first question is always:</i>

539
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,960
<i>Are these cannibals?
No, they are not cannibals.</i>

540
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,670
<i>Cannibalism,
in the true sense of the word...</i>

541
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:13,000
<i>...implies an intraspecies activity.</i>

542
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,760
<i>These creatures
cannot be considered human.</i>

543
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,260
<i>They prey on humans.</i>

544
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,550
<i>They do not prey on each other.
That's the difference.</i>

545
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,850
<i>They attack and they feed only
on warm human flesh.</i>

546
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:31,770
<i>Intelligence?
Seemingly little or no reasoning power.</i>

547
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,280
<i>What basic skills remain
are more remembered behaviors...</i>

548
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,320
<i>...from, uh, normal life.</i>

549
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,660
<i>There are reports
of these creatures using tools...</i>

550
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,740
<i>...but even these actions
are the most primitive.</i>

551
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:47,790
<i>The use of external articles
as bludgeons and so forth.</i>

552
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,880
<i>I might point out to you
that even animals will adopt...</i>

553
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,590
<i>...the basic use of tools in this manner.</i>

554
00:55:53,750 --> 00:56:00,050
<i>These creatures are nothing
but pure motorized instinct.</i>

555
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,180
<i>We must not be lulled by the concept...</i>

556
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,310
<i>...that these are our family members
or our friends.</i>

557
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:09,020
<i>They are not.
They will not respond to such emotions.</i>

558
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:14,730
<i>They are.
- They must be destroyed on sight.</i>

559
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,900
Look, we need to block those entrances.

560
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:20,490
Those trucks are the answer.
We put one at each door.

561
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,160
<i>] They're working on
an analysis of this whole phenomenon...</i>

562
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,330
<i>...uh, from the point of view
of a viral disease.</i>

563
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,710
<i>They're doing various laboratory tests...</i>

564
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:32,670
<i>...to see if they can deal with it
in that way.</i>

565
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:37,170
<i>Perhaps come up with some kind
of a workable vaccine.</i>

566
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,840
Hey, Fran.

567
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:41,680
<i>According to this report,
the problem they've run into in Atlanta...</i>

568
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,050
<i>...is that there are
no live specimens available.</i>

569
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,390
<i>Uh, in that area, there are in fact...</i>

570
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:51,520
<i>Uh, we've had a filmed report
shot in Atlanta.</i>

571
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,520
<i>But it has not arrived yet.
Contact has been...</i>

572
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:56,520
I would've made you all
coffee and breakfast...

573
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:58,440
...but I don't have my pots and pans.

574
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:02,360
<i>Also, uh...</i>

575
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,370
<i>Wait a minute.
Uh, there's another report...</i>

576
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:06,790
May I say something?

577
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:08,910
Sure.

578
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,540
Sorry you found out I'm pregnant...

579
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,790
...because I don't wanna be treated
any differently than you treat each other,

580
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,130
Oh, hey, Fran, come on.

581
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,050
And I'm not gonna be
den mother for you guys.

582
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:20,630
I wanna know what's going on.

583
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,050
And I wanna have something to say
about the plans.

584
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,260
There's four of us, okay?

585
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,760
Jesus, Fran.

586
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,100
Fair enough.

587
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,600
Okay. Now, what's going on?

588
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:33,100
We're going out.
And you're not coming with us.

589
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:36,150
And you won't come with us
until you learn how to handle yourself.

590
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,570
Something else.

591
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:43,740
I don't know about you two...

592
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,990
...but I wanna learn
how to fly that helicopter.

593
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:52,080
If anything happens to you,
we have to be able to fly out of here.

594
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,210
She's right, man.

595
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,250
Come on, let's go.

596
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:03,680
And I don't want you to leave me
without a gun again.

597
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,610
I just might be able to figure out
how to use it.

598
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:23,860
I'm sorry, Stephen.

599
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,360
It's all right. It's all right.

600
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,120
Stephen.

601
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,500
Yeah?

602
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:35,330
Be careful.

603
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,130
Yeah, we'll be all right.

604
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:41,340
<i>To at least keep
some of the chaos under control.</i>

605
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,840
<i>Bowling for Dollars at 6.</i>

606
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:44,670
<i>In spite of everything,
as you can hear...</i>

607
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,800
<i>...there are still people
with a sense of humor.</i>

608
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,140
How about it?

609
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,730
Getting it.

610
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,370
I'm not too sure of this thing.
I'll just ride pick-up.

611
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:12,160
I grew up in one of these things.
Come on.

612
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,330
All right.

613
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,530
<i>Hey, Too Tall Too Slow Two, come in.</i>

614
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,910
You look my size
when you're sitting in a truck.

615
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,620
<i>What I wanna know is how we both
got in the same force together...</i>

616
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:00,120
<i>...you being so large and all.</i>

617
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:02,420
Well, they told me
it was a midget force.

618
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:04,210
<i>They needed somebody to look up to.</i>

619
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:07,800
Hey, Where's fly boy? Where's his 20?

620
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:11,590
He's probably up on the roof
with flygirl.

621
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,560
All right, full speed. Let's go, come on.

622
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,420
Come on, hotshot. Come on.

623
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,340
Ha, ha. We got you, suckers.

624
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:51,050
Come on. Come on, man.

625
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,550
Hey. Hey.

626
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,100
Hey.

627
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,310
Three more, baby. Three more!

628
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:21,020
Roger,

629
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:30,190
Come on. Look, man.

630
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:36,910
Look.

631
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,430
<i>What?</i>

632
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,250
Get its head up.

633
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:34,510
Get its head up.

634
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,260
Roger, get its head up, man.

635
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:04,290
Get down!
Get down and stay down. I've got it.

636
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:06,620
Roger, move!

637
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,720
You bastards.

638
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:22,220
You bastards.

639
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,310
Roger,

640
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:29,640
We got this, man.
We got this by the ass.

641
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:35,980
Roger,

642
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:39,400
Come on, man, get your head together.
We got a lot of work to do.

643
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:42,910
Let's go, baby. Number two.

644
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,330
You all right?

645
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,410
Perfect, baby. Perfect.

646
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,740
Come on, bring it up.

647
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,090
<b>For chrissake, come on, man.</b>

648
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,090
Roger, look out.

649
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,840
Roger, come on. Come on, man.

650
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:34,600
Come on, Roger. Come on.

651
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:39,980
Goddamn motherfucking
sons of bitches.

652
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,330
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

653
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,790
What?

654
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:57,080
My bag,
I left my goddamn bag in the other truck.

655
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:04,300
All right, trooper.
You better screw your head on.

656
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:06,130
Yeah, come on, come on. Let's go.

657
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:07,760
I mean it, man.

658
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:11,310
Now you're not just playing with your life,
you're playing with mine.

659
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,810
Now are you straight?

660
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:21,230
Yeah.

661
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:45,670
Go, Rog. Go, go, go.

662
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,430
Come on, Rog. Come on.

663
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:51,430
Shit.

664
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:00,350
Watch it, man.

665
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:03,860
Watch out. Come on.

666
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,440
Back up, man.

667
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,030
Roger! Roger, watch it!

668
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,700
Damn.

669
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:21,540
Roger!

670
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:24,550
Oh, God.

671
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,890
They got him.

672
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,400
That's it, man.

673
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,150
- That's it.
- Oh, bullshit.

674
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,570
We gotta deal with that leg.

675
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:52,240
Mao, I'm dealing with it, man.
Don't you worry about it.

676
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:58,620
There's a lot to get done
before you can afford to lose me.

677
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:12,260
It all depends on how many
of them are still inside.

678
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:14,260
That's one hell of a run
we've gotta make.

679
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:16,350
If we had more flares.

680
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:18,270
Maybe some of those propane jobs.

681
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:21,390
Guns are first. Guns and ammunition.

682
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:25,110
I'm sorry.

683
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,620
You sure you gonna make it?

684
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:41,830
Just hurry up with that.

685
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:07,730
Whew.

686
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,980
How about this, huh?

687
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:36,090
Don't try to shoot through those gates.

688
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,340
Openings are too small.

689
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:39,850
Bullet will wind up
chasing us around in here.

690
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:42,270
Don't worry. They can't get through.

691
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:59,200
- Ain't it a crime?
- What?

692
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:01,370
The only person
who could ever miss with this gun...

693
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,580
...will be the sucker
with the bread to buy it.

694
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,590
You just wait out there, sissies.

695
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,460
We're coming...

696
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,590
...and we're ready.

697
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:51,250
Okay, let's go.

698
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:21,950
When the door opens, push.

699
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,120
That's it, push. That's it.

700
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,640
Come on, let's go.

701
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,310
Hardware.

702
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:54,900
Look here, man, I, urn...

703
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,150
I know. Shut up, will you?

704
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:13,420
All right. The toughest part
will be getting by these right here.

705
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,090
Too far.

706
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:18,800
There's no backing out now.
We've gotta lock those main doors.

707
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,010
We'll never make all four entrances.
It's too risky.

708
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,630
We'll make it.

709
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,220
You just be ready to open up for us.

710
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:29,020
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, the car.

711
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,230
- What?
- One of the cars.

712
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:33,190
Why don't you use
one of the cars over there?

713
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:39,740
You okay to start it?

714
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:40,900
Okay, let's go.

715
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,790
Come on.

716
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,580
Close the door. Close the door.

717
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,050
The keys, Stephen, the keys!

718
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:02,800
Oh, Jesus Christ.

719
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:13,390
Come on, man. Get out of there.

720
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:16,730
Goddamn it.

721
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,270
Keep them, Stephen. Just keep them.

722
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,570
Come on, just hang a minute.

723
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,030
Oh, man.

724
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:30,390
Just jump in the back.

725
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:36,390
- You all right?
- I got it.

726
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,130
You get the latches, I'll get the lock.

727
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,880
Got you.

728
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,810
That's not a hundred percent.

729
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,570
But I don't think they'll get through.

730
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:25,190
Can't they smash the glass?

731
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,530
Safety stuff. Pretty indestructible.

732
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:29,950
They got no leverage under the truck.

733
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:32,910
I'm hoping they'll just go away
after they find they can't get in.

734
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:36,240
I'll get the alarm. Get in the car.

735
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:47,260
<b>Go.</b>

736
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:52,890
We're okay.

737
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,220
<i>We got it made.
It's gonna work.</i>

738
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:26,840
How many you figure are already here?

739
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,460
Don't know. Not too many.

740
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:30,260
We'll get them easy.

741
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:33,010
We'll get it all locked up.

742
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:35,640
Then we're going on a hunt.

743
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:20,280
We put up a wall here:

744
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:22,620
This way,
we can still get to the plumbing.

745
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:24,330
Why don't we just board up
the stairway?

746
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,540
Sooner or later,
there might be a patrol through here.

747
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:28,710
Looters, maybe.

748
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:33,090
I don't want anybody to even know
that stairway exists.

749
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:04,080
I don't know what else to do.

750
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,250
You're doing fine.

751
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:10,460
His leg is awful.
The infection is spreading quickly.

752
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:14,170
Can't we do something?
Can't we take him to a med unit?

753
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:18,430
I've seen half a dozen guys
get bitten by those things.

754
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:22,430
None of them lasted
more than three days.

755
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:27,020
Peter, where are you?

756
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,480
Right here, trooper,

757
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:33,610
We did it, didn't we?

758
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,030
We whipped them, didn't we?

759
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:38,320
That's right, Rog.

760
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:40,030
Didn't we?

761
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:42,450
Didn't we whip them?

762
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,620
We sure did, buddy.

763
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:49,540
We whipped them.
Whipped them good.

764
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:53,380
We whipped them and we got it all!

765
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:09,640
Hey, Fran

766
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:24,740
- Frannie.
- Leave me alone.

767
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:27,580
It's all right. It's my problem.

768
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,000
Just get out of here.
I don't want you here.

769
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,250
I just don't want you to see me
like this, okay?

770
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:41,170
Stephen, get out, please.

771
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,110
This place is gonna be rotten.

772
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:02,360
We gotta clean it up, brother.

773
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,600
You never know.

774
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:21,940
<i>Money, money, money</i>

775
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:24,490
Look right.

776
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,560
What do you think?

777
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:13,950
They're still here.

778
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:17,330
They're after us.
They know were still in here.

779
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:20,120
They're after the place.

780
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:23,290
They don't know why,
they just remember.

781
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:26,330
Remember that they wanna be in here.

782
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,130
What the hell are they?

783
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:30,090
They're us, that's all.

784
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:34,470
- There's no more room in hell.
- What?

785
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:37,510
Something my granddaddy
used to tell us.

786
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:39,760
<i>You know macumba?</i>

787
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:42,600
Voodoo.

788
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:45,520
Granddad was a priest in Trinidad.

789
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:47,940
He used to tell us:

790
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:53,440
"When there's no more room in hell,
the dead will walk the earth. "

791
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:08,670
Never mind, get up. Hurry up, come on.

792
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:12,010
Jesus, hurry up!

793
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,210
<b>Go on.</b>

794
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:52,210
I'll stay with him.

795
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:17,570
You'll take care of me,
won't you, Peter?

796
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:19,490
I mean...

797
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,740
...you'd take care of me when I go.

798
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,200
Just try to get some sleep, man.
Save your strength.

799
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:26,910
<b>I...,.</b>

800
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:33,090
I don't wanna be walking around
like that.

801
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:36,670
Peter,

802
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:41,510
- Peter!
- Yes, I'm here, man.

803
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,770
Don't do it till you're sure
I am conning back.

804
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:57,570
I'm gonna try...

805
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,450
...not to.

806
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:05,160
I'm gonna try not to come back.

807
01:29:05,450 --> 01:29:08,250
I'm gonna try...

808
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:14,590
...not to.

809
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:20,470
<i>They use 5 percent
of the food available in the human body.</i>

810
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:21,680
<i>The kind of-</i>

811
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,140
<i>With that small amount...</i>

812
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:28,680
<i>...the body is usually intact enough
to be mobile when it revives,</i>

813
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:30,640
<i>What are you saying? I mean-</i>

814
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:34,980
<i>- Dummies, dummies, dummies!
- Are you suggesting that we hurt them?</i>

815
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:37,480
<i>Excuse me, listen. Quiet, quiet.</i>

816
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:40,650
<i>Shh.
- One wonders whether it's worth saving.</i>

817
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:42,160
<i>It's worth saving.</i>

818
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:47,700
<i>For all I know the brains are already dead,
and it's the idiots that are still alive.</i>

819
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:49,870
<i>Huh?</i>

820
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,420
<i>And I figured out how to stay alive too.</i>

821
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:54,330
<i>And I'm trying to help you, dummies.</i>

822
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:56,840
<i>In your calm helping way,
you do irritate</i>

823
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,630
<i>In my calm logic way-
To the illogical way-</i>

824
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,680
<i>Illogical hell!</i>

825
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,550
<i>Illogical hell.</i>

826
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,640
<i>I'm showing you a way...</i>

827
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:10,980
<i>...that we can up the food supply
20 times.</i>

828
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:14,650
<i>The food supply for who?</i>

829
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:17,520
<i>For a whole specimen
that is walking around there...</i>

830
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:18,900
<i>...in increasing numbers-</i>

831
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:21,530
<i>- We should feed them?
- What else you gonna do with them?</i>

832
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,490
<i>- God.
- Give me an alternative.</i>

833
01:30:23,650 --> 01:30:24,740
<i>Let's start a zoo.</i>

834
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:29,080
<i>I thought you scientists can come up
with an actual way to solve the problem...</i>

835
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,330
<i>...rather than feeding the opposition.</i>

836
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,540
<i>Doesn't make any sense.</i>

837
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,250
<i>I can think of one other alternative.</i>

838
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:37,080
<i>I can think of another alternative, yes.</i>

839
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:41,260
<i>Since they seem to congregate
in heavily populated areas...</i>

840
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:44,720
<i>...and since we haven't touched upon
our nuclear resources.</i>

841
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,720
<i>Why don't we drop bombs
on all the big cities?</i>

842
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:49,510
<i>- You're probably serious-
- I'm deadly serious.</i>

843
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:51,430
<i>- What choices?
They'll run out of food.</i>

844
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,890
<i>They won't run out of food, young lady.
That's the problem you see.</i>

845
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:57,480
<i>And they won't run out of food
while we're still alive.</i>

846
01:30:57,650 --> 01:31:02,070
<i>These kind of thing is out,
the things that you're talking about here...</i>

847
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,240
<i>...sound like just a bunch of people</i>

848
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,070
<i>This is not political rhetoric.
We're not fighting...</i>

849
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,280
<i>This is not the Republicans
versus the Democrats.</i>

850
01:31:10,910 --> 01:31:12,330
<i>They've got us in the hole.</i>

851
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,410
<i>Economically, only we're in another war.</i>

852
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,750
<i>It's more crucial than that,
we are down to the line, folks.</i>

853
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,000
<i>We are down to the line.</i>

854
01:31:21,170 --> 01:31:25,090
<i>- There are no divisions among-
- Please.</i>

855
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,970
<i>Shh.</i>

856
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:30,560
<i>- At least let him finish.
- We've got to remain...</i>

857
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,930
It's really all over, isn't it?

858
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,430
<i>Unemotional</i>

859
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,730
<i>Quiet.</i>

860
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:40,440
<i>We've got to remain rational.</i>

861
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:42,570
<i>Logical.</i>

862
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:44,900
<i>- Ho, ho, ho.
- Logical.</i>

863
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:48,240
<i>Scientists always think
in those kind of terms.</i>

864
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:51,620
<i>It doesn't work that way.
That's not how people really are.</i>

865
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:55,660
<i>We've got to remain logical.
We've got to.</i>

866
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:59,380
<i>There's no choice. It has to be that.</i>

867
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,750
<i>It's got to be that.</i>

868
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:37,160
- Here it comes.
- Ah.

869
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,290
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, nice.

870
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:42,790
Thanks.

871
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:46,170
- For the lady.
- Thank you.

872
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:47,920
There you are.

873
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:51,140
- Stephen.
- Thank you very much.

874
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,640
Mm-hm.

875
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:57,220
Peter, what about you?
Where are you going?

876
01:32:57,390 --> 01:33:00,020
This is just for the two of you.

877
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:08,360
Enjoy.

878
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:09,740
Thanks.

879
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:06,090
We can't, Stephen. Not now.

880
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,050
It wouldn't be real.

881
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:03,550
<i>Attention all shoppers.</i>

882
01:37:03,930 --> 01:37:09,980
<i>If you have a sweet tooth,
we have a special treat for you.</i>

883
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:15,980
<i>If your purchases in the next half hour
amount to $5 or more...</i>

884
01:37:16,150 --> 01:37:20,280
<i>...we'll give you a bag
of hard candies, free...</i>

885
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:25,450
<i>...to take home to the kiddies
or enjoy yourself.</i>

886
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:29,500
<i>So hurry and do your shopping.</i>

887
01:38:25,010 --> 01:38:27,970
There hasn't been a broadcast
for three days. Why don't you give it up?

888
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,390
They might come back on.

889
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:19,060
What have we done to ourselves?

890
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:50,390
Okay. Now, easy, easy.

891
01:39:54,270 --> 01:39:55,930
Stabilize it, that's right.

892
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,610
Take it down. Down, down.

893
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:08,740
That's it, you got it.

894
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:11,280
Hon, you got it.

895
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:13,740
I did it!

896
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:17,920
Hey.

897
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,290
- Wow.
- They must get in through the roof,

898
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,000
Son of a bitch.

899
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:24,000
They got trucks
blocking all the entrances.

900
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:26,050
Yeah, trucks.

901
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:27,470
No sweat.

902
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,640
What do you think?
Do we hit them now or tonight?

903
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:35,140
Tonight.

904
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:39,100
A comb?

905
01:40:58,330 --> 01:41:00,670
<i>We know you're up there.
We saw the whirlybird on the roof.</i>

906
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:02,920
Hey, wanna see my whirlybird?

907
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:05,630
Will you guys can it? Can this shit.

908
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,050
Raiders.

909
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:11,090
Listen,
could you use some company up there?

910
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:14,510
- We're just riding by.
- We could use some company down here.

911
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:17,680
- They know we're here, maybe we-
- No chance.

912
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:21,560
- Oh, thanks very much, you wanna try it?
- Oh, it's a radio...

913
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:24,520
All right, can it, can it. Can it.

914
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:28,190
Okay, listen, how many
have you got up there anyway?

915
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,360
Look, there's three of us.

916
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:34,660
- What if-
- Shh, quiet!

917
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:38,200
- I think we should-
- Jesus Christ, shut up and listen.

918
01:41:38,370 --> 01:41:40,540
<i>Hey, you in the mall, listen.</i>

919
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:43,670
We don't like people who don't share.
You just fucked up real bad.

920
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,720
Let's go.

921
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:05,900
Let's go, let's go.

922
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:34,550
Just three, huh?

923
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,220
Holy shit!

924
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:44,730
They'll get in. They'll move the trucks.

925
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,730
There's hundreds of those creatures
down there.

926
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:49,230
Come on, man.
That's a professional army.

927
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:52,780
Looks like they been surviving on the road
all through this thing.

928
01:42:53,570 --> 01:42:59,620
Well, let's not make it easy for them.
Come on.

929
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,040
- What's happening?
- Fifteen or 20 of them.

930
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:08,960
- We'll shut the gates.
- Stephen!

931
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:12,630
We're just gonna shut the gates.
They'll never know we're here.

932
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:28,150
- Downstairs first.
- Okay.

933
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:29,650
- Got your talk box?
- Yeah.

934
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:31,320
Keep it handy.

935
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:24,950
- Watch out, Billy.
- Down there.

936
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:44,930
They're in, flyboy.
Be up in the loading docks.

937
01:44:57,030 --> 01:45:01,950
When those bay doors open, there's
gonna be a thousand zombies in here.

938
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:03,870
That'll take the heat off us.

939
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:06,500
These guys
are gonna have their hands full.

940
01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:39,150
Don't be looking for yourself.
Look for us, now let's go.

941
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:51,390
Hee-yah.

942
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:00,030
Hey, Nick.

943
01:47:19,130 --> 01:47:20,170
Flyboy.

944
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:23,760
<i>Fly boy.</i>

945
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,380
Flyboy, where the hell are you?

946
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:35,770
- Come on, just throw it.
- Come on, man, let's get out of here.

947
01:47:39,230 --> 01:47:41,270
It's ours.

948
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:43,530
We took it.

949
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:45,700
It's ours.

950
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:03,920
What the hell are you doing?
Someone's up there shooting at us.

951
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:07,760
Goddamn you, flyboy.
What the hell are you doing?

952
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:28,610
<i>Just stay out of sight.</i>

953
01:48:28,780 --> 01:48:30,780
They're after the place,
they don't care about us.

954
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:41,130
<i>All right, damn it.</i>

955
01:48:41,290 --> 01:48:43,300
Now we've got a war.

956
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:55,970
Say goodbye, creep.

957
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:16,720
What the hell are you gonna watch
on that thing?

958
01:50:16,890 --> 01:50:18,060
I don't know, man.

959
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:37,240
Hey, Nick.

960
01:50:39,910 --> 01:50:41,830
Upstairs, come on.

961
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:58,930
Nick, come on, you mother...

962
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:04,100
- The lights.
- The lights went off.

963
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:05,560
Hit the lights.

964
01:51:06,810 --> 01:51:08,940
- Where did he go?
- Down there, come on.

965
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:30,130
I see you!

966
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:50,650
Peter! Peter!

967
01:51:56,490 --> 01:51:57,950
Peter!

968
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:07,790
Rope, man.

969
01:52:30,190 --> 01:52:33,230
- I know he's in here.
- Come on!

970
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:39,860
- Hey, come on down.
- Come on.

971
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:52,290
Give me a bike.

972
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:13,020
Son of a bitch.

973
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:34,600
- Peter, Peter.
- Where the hell are you?

974
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:36,190
In the elevator.

975
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:38,110
<i>And those things,
they're all over the place.</i>

976
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:41,360
Climb up top.
I'll get you out of the grid in the shaft.

977
01:54:45,490 --> 01:54:47,030
I'm coming

978
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:56,560
Flyboy. Flyboy!

979
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:00,730
Flyboy.

980
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:32,970
Damn it, flyboy.

981
01:57:25,110 --> 01:57:26,320
He's dead?

982
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:29,650
I heard his gun. Maybe he's all right.

983
01:57:36,490 --> 01:57:38,250
We'll just wait.

984
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:42,040
We'll just wait a while and see.

985
01:57:59,140 --> 01:58:00,850
It's almost light. Let's go.

986
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:06,690
He hasn't answered the radio for hours.

987
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:11,740
For God's sake.

988
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:22,740
- What is it?
- Stephen.

989
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:25,830
They're coming up.

990
02:00:40,010 --> 02:00:41,680
Go on. Get out of here.

991
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:50,350
- Peter.
- I said get out of here.

992
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:56,280
- Jesus Christ, Peter.
- I don't wanna go.

993
02:00:58,950 --> 02:01:01,070
I really don't.

994
02:01:35,190 --> 02:01:36,610
Get up.

995
02:01:37,230 --> 02:01:38,900
Move, woman!

996
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:46,220
- How much fuel do we have?
- Not much.

997
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:50,090
All right.
