00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,589
<i>Legendary was the Xanadu...</i>

4
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:39,260
<i>...where Kubla Khan decreed
his stately pleasure dome.</i>

5
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:42,794
<i>Today almost as legendary
as Florida's Xanadu...</i>

6
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:45,272
<i>...the world's largest
private pleasure ground.</i>

7
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,311
<i>Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast.
A private mountain...</i>

8
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,372
<i>...was commissioned and successfully built.</i>

9
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,977
<i>One hundred thousand trees.
Twenty thousand tons of marble...</i>

10
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:59,681
<i>...are the ingredients
of Xanadu's mountain.</i>

11
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:03,191
<i>Contents of Xanadu's palace:</i>

12
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:07,423
<i>Paintings. Pictures. Statues.
Various stones of other palaces.</i>

13
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,697
<i>A collection of everything.</i>

14
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:12,997
<i>So big it can never
be catalogued or appraised.</i>

15
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:16,937
<i> Enough for 10 museums.
The loot of the world.</i>

16
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,511
<i>Xanadu's livestock...</i>

17
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,041
<i>...the fowl of the air. The fish of the sea.
The beast of the field and jungle...</i>

18
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:33,652
<i>...two of each.
The biggest private zoo since Noah.</i>

19
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,155
<i>Like the Pharaohs...</i>

20
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:40,285
<i>...Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones
to mark his grave.</i>

21
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:43,356
<i>Since the Pyramids...</i>

22
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,296
<i>...Xanadu is the costliest monument...</i>

23
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,769
<i>...a man has built to himself.</i>

24
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:04,513
<i>Here in Xanadu last week...</i>

25
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:07,755
<i>...Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.</i>

26
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,788
<i>A potent figure of our century...</i>

27
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,055
<i>...America's Kubla Khan:</i>

28
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,394
<i>Charles Foster Kane.</i>

29
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:47,854
<i>Its humble beginnings.
In this ramshackle building. A dying daily.</i>

30
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:50,592
<i>Kane's empire. In its glory...</i>

31
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,726
<i>...held dominion over 37 newspapers.
Two syndicates...</i>

32
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:59,500
<i>...a radio network.
An empire upon an empire.</i>

33
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:03,711
<i>The first of grocery stores. Paper mills...</i>

34
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:09,513
<i>...apartment buildings.
Factories. Forests. Ocean liners.</i>

35
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:12,919
<i>An empire through which for 50 years...</i>

36
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,457
<i>...flowed in an unending stream...</i>

37
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,922
<i>...the wealth of the Earth's
third richest gold mine.</i>

38
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,527
<i>Famed in American legend
is the origin of the Kane fortune.</i>

39
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,163
<i>How. To boarding housekeeper Mary Kane.
By a defaulting boarder. In 1868...</i>

40
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:33,106
<i>...was left the supposedly worthless deed
to an abandoned mineshaft:</i>

41

<i>The Colorado Lode.</i>

42
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:40,576
<i>Fifty-seven years later.
Before a congressional investigation...</i>

43
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,086
<i>...Walter P. Thatcher.
Grand old man of Wall Street...</i>

44

<i>...recalls a journey he made as a youth.</i>

46
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,861
My firm had been appointed trustee
by Mrs. Kane...

47
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,296
...for a large fortune she recently acquired.

48
00:06:56,366 --> 00:07:00,462
It was her wish that I take charge
of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.

49
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:05,270
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion,
Charles Foster Kane...

50
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:10,176
...personally attacked you after striking you
in the stomach with a sled?

51
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,682
I shall read to the committee
a prepared statement...

52
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,188
...which I have brought with me,
and then refuse to answer questions.

53
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,022
Mr. Charles Foster Kane,
in every essence of his social beliefs...

54
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:26,084
...and by the dangerous manner
he has persistently attacked...

55
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,460
...American traditions of private property...

56
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,863
...initiative and opportunity
for advancement...

57
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:34,836
...is, in fact, nothing more or less
than a communist.

58
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:37,463
<i>That same month in Union Square...</i>

59
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,168
<i>The words "Charles Foster Kane"...</i>

60
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:43,768
<i>...are a menace
to every workingman in this land.</i>

61
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,484
<i>He is today what he has always been
and always will be: A fascist.</i>

62
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,786
<i>And still another opinion...</i>

63
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:12,332
<i>Kane urged his country's entry
into one war...</i>

64
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:15,102
<i>...opposed participation in another.</i>

65
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,177
<i>Won the election
to one American president at least.</i>

66
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,009
<i>Spoke for millions of Americans.</i>

67
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:25,614
<i>Was hated by as many more.</i>

68
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,517
<i>For 40 years appeared in Kane newsprint...</i>

69
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,059
<i>...no public issue
on which Kane papers took no stand.</i>

70
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:39,833
<i>No public man whom Kane himself
did not support or denounce.</i>

71
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:43,929
<i>Often support. Then denounce.</i>

72
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:55,684
<i>Twice married. Twice divorced.</i>

73
00:08:55,985 --> 00:08:58,283
<i>First to a president's niece...</i>

74
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:01,482
<i>...Emily Norton. Who left him in 1916.</i>

75
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:05,620
<i>Died 1918 in a motor accident
with their son.</i>

76
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:10,430
<i>Sixteen years after his first marriage...</i>

77
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,798
<i>...two weeks after his first divorce...</i>

78
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:15,163
<i>...Kane married Susan Alexander...</i>

79
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:18,537
<i>...singer. At the Town Hall
in Trenton. New Jersey.</i>

80
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:24,611
<i>For wife two.
One-time opera-singing Susan Alexander...</i>

81
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:28,046
<i>...Kane built
Chicago's Municipal Opera House.</i>

82
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,551
<i>Cost: $3 million.</i>

83
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:36,785
<i>Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane.
Half-finished before she divorced him...</i>

84
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,850
<i>...the still unfinished...</i>

85
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,495
<i>...Xanadu.</i>

86
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:43,760
<i>Cost: No man can say.</i>

87
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,403
<i>Kane. Molder of mass opinion
though he was...</i>

88
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,234
<i>...in all his life
was never granted elective office...</i>

89
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:55,004
<i>...by the voters of his country.</i>

90
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:57,842
<i>But Kane papers were once strong indeed...</i>

91
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,505
<i>...and once the prize seemed almost his.</i>

92
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:04,219
<i>In 1916. as independent candidate
for governor...</i>

93
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,755
<i>...the best elements of the state
behind him...</i>

94
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:11,692
<i>...the White House seemingly the next
easy step in a lightning political career...</i>

95
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:15,629
<i>...then suddenly. Less than one week
before election...</i>

96
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:17,655
<i>...defeat.</i>

97
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:19,895
<i>Shameful. Ignominious.</i>

98
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:24,128
<i>Defeat that set back for 20 years
the cause of reform in the U. S...</i>

99
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,973
<i>...forever cancelled political chances
for Charles Foster Kane.</i>

100
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,106
<i>Then. In the first year
of the Great Depression...</i>

101
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,878
<i>...a Kane paper closes.</i>

102
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,750
<i>For Kane. In four short years. Collapse.</i>

103
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:46,323
<i>Eleven Kane papers merged.
More sold. Scrapped.</i>

104
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:57,064
Is that correct?

105
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,506
Don't believe everything you hear
on the radio.

106
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:03,511
<i>- Read the Inquirer.
- How were business conditions in Europe?</i>

107
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,515
How did I find business conditions
in Europe, Mr. Bones?

108
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,311
With great difficulty.

109
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:13,549
Are you glad to be back?

110
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:16,114
I'm always glad to be back.
I'm an American.

111
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:19,586
Always been an American. Anything else?

112
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:22,756
When I was a reporter,
we asked them quicker than that.

113
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,324
What do you think
of the chances for war in Europe?

114
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:29,735
I talked with the responsible leaders
of England, France, Germany and Italy.

115
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:32,306
They're too intelligent
to embark on a project...

116
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,866
...that would mean the end of civilization.

117
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:38,571
You can take my word for it,
there will be no war.

118
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,614
<i>Kane helped to change the world...</i>

119
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:48,383
<i>...but Kane's world now is history...</i>

120
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,894
<i>...and the great yellow journalist himself
lived to be history...</i>

121
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,293
<i>...outlived his power to make it.</i>

122
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:59,191
<i>Alone in his never-finished.
Already decaying pleasure palace...</i>

123
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:02,836
<i>...aloof. Seldom visited.
Never photographed...</i>

124
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,132
<i>...an emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing empire.</i>

125
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:10,575
<i>Vainly attempted to sway. As he once did...</i>

126
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:14,314
<i>...the destinies of a nation
that had ceased to listen to him...</i>

127
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:16,146
<i>...ceased to trust him.</i>

128
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:22,215
<i>Then last week. As it must to all men...</i>

129
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,787
<i>...death came to Charles Foster Kane.</i>

130
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:28,594
News on the March.

131
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:34,963
That's it.

132
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:38,640
Stand by.
I'll tell you if we want to run it again.

133
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,336
- How about it, Mr. Rawlston?
- How do you like it, boys?

134
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,312
- Seventy years in a man's life.
- That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.

135
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,849
It's a good short,
but what it needs is an angle.

136
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:51,216
All we saw on that screen
was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.

137
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,380
I know that. I read the papers.

138
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,947
It isn't enough to tell us what a man did...

139
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:59,422
...you've got to tell us who he was.

140
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:02,794
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?

141
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,833
Do you remember, boys?

142
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:07,369
What were the last words
he said on Earth?

143
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:09,529
Maybe he told us about himself
on his deathbed.

144
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,733
- Maybe he didn't.
- All we saw was a big American.

145
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:15,801
How did he differ from Ford,
Hearst or John Doe?

146
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,509
I tell you, a man's dying words...

147
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,548
What were they?
You don't read the papers.

148
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,141
When Charles Foster Kane died,
he said one word:

149
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,208
<i>"Rosebud. "</i>

150
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:26,050
That's all he said? Tough guy.

151
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:28,420
<i>Yes, "Rosebud. " Just that one word.</i>

152
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,452
- But who is she?
- What was it?

153
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:32,721
Here's a man
who could've been president...

154
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,059
...who was as loved,
hated and talked about...

155
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:37,725
...as any man in our time,
but when he dies...

156
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:40,031
...something is on his mind called Rosebud.

157
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:42,570
- What does that mean?
- A racehorse he bet on once.

158
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:45,004
- That didn't come in.
- But what was the race?

159
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,234
Rosebud.

160
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:47,139
- Thompson.
- Yes.

161
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,143
Hold this up a week, two if you must.

162
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,008
Don't you think right after he's dead...

163
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,208
Find out about Rosebud. Get in touch
with anybody who knew him...

164
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:55,773
...or knew him well.

165
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:57,779
That manager of his...

166
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,311
Bernstein. His second wife.
She's still living.

167
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:01,686
Susan Alexander Kane.

168
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,590
- She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
- That's right.

169
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:08,095
See them all. Get in touch with everybody
that ever worked for him...

170
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:11,065
...whoever loved him,
whoever hated his guts.

171
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,392
I don't mean go through
the city directory of course.

172
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,062
I'll get on it right away.

173
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,868
Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.

174
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,269
It will probably turn out to be
a very simple thing.

175
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:03,241
Miss Alexander.

176
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:06,717
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.

177
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:09,154
I want another drink, John.

178
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:15,029
Right away.
Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?

179
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:18,624
- I'll have a highball, please.
- Who told you you could sit down?

180
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,437
I thought maybe we could have a talk.

181
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,972
Think again.

182
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:27,539
Can't you people leave me alone?

183
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:29,873
I'm minding my own business,
you mind yours.

184
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,880
If I could just have a talk with you,
Miss Alexander. I'd...

185
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:34,472
Get out of here.

186
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:37,513
Get out!

187
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,378
- Sorry.
- Get out.

188
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,158
- Maybe some other time.
- Get out.

189
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,296
Gino.

190
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,969
Get her another highball.

191
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:02,002
She just won't talk to nobody,
Mr. Thompson.

192
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:03,170
Okay.

193
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,977
- Another double?
- Yeah.

194
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:10,714
Hello, I want New York City.

195
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:15,281
Courtland 79970.
This is Atlantic City 46827. All right.

196
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:19,951
She's...

197
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:22,288
She'll snap out of it.

198
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:25,764
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon
talk about Mr. Kane as any...

199
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:27,234
- Hello.
- Sooner.

200
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:29,963
This is Thompson. Let me talk to the chief.

201
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,765
Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.

202
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,876
The second Mrs. Kane.
About Rosebud or anything else.

203
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,709
I'm calling from Atlantic City.

204
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:42,410
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia,
to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.

205
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:43,850
They're expecting me.

206
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,446
Then I've a meeting with his
general manager in New York. Bernstein.

207
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:49,023
Then I'm coming back here.

208
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,060
Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive.
Goodbye.

209
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:55,018
- Hey...
- John.

210
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,928
You just might be able to help me.

211
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:00,696
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane,
did she ever mention Rosebud?

212
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,601
<i>"Rosebud"?</i>

213
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,997
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.

214
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:09,501
As a matter of fact, just the other day,
when the papers were full of it...

215
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,107
...I asked her.

216
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,776
She never heard of Rosebud.

217
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:32,525
The directors of the Thatcher Memorial
Library have asked me to remind you...

218
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:35,363
...about the conditions
under which you may...

219
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:38,600
...inspect certain portions
of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.

220
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:41,302
- I remember them.
- Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.

221
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:43,937
- All I want is an hour...
- Under no circumstances...

222
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:47,779
...are direct quotes from his manuscript
to be used by you. You may follow me.

223
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,047
That's all right. I'm just looking for...

224
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:04,425
Jennings.

225
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:10,928
Thank you, Jennings.

226
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:14,771
You will be required to leave this room
at 4:30 promptly.

227
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,670
You will confine yourself,
it is our understanding...

228
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:21,238
...to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's
manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.

229
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,217
That's all I'm interested in.

230
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,518
Thank you.

231
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,758
Pages 83 to 142.

232
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:09,960
Come on, boys.

233
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:11,463
Be careful, Charles.

234
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:12,464
Mrs. Kane.

235
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,729
Pull your muffler around your neck,
Charles.

236
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,068
Mrs. Kane,
I think we'll have to tell him now.

237
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:20,631
Yes, I'll sign those papers now,
Mr. Thatcher.

238
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:24,110
You people seem to forget
that I'm the boy's father.

239
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,114
It's going to be done
exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.

240
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:30,879
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son...

241
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:32,783
...just 'cause we came into money.

242
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:35,790
If I want to, I can go to court.
A father has a right to.

243
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:39,191
A boarder that beats his bill
and leaves worthless stock behind...

244
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,196
That property is as much my property
as anybody's...

245
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,199
...now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea...

246
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,828
...this would happen, he'd have made out
the certificates in both our names.

247
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:52,396
- But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
- He owed the money to both of us.

248
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:57,309
<i>- "The bank's decision in all matters... "
- I don't hold with giving Charles to a bank...</i>

249
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:59,643
- Stop this nonsense.
- We're a bit uneducated...

250
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,808
<i>"The bank's decision
concerning his education...</i>

251
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:04,409
<i>"... his places of residence, is to be final. "</i>

252
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:08,047
- The idea of a bank being the guardian...
- Stop this nonsense, Jim.

253
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,024
<i>"We will assume full management
of the Colorado Lode"...</i>

254
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,755
...which I repeat, Mrs. Kane,
you are the sole owner.

255
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,957
- Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
- Right here.

256
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:18,499
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.

257
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:21,764
You'd think I hadn't been
a good husband or father...

258
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,396
The sum of $50,000 a year...

259
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,669
...is to be paid to you
and Mr. Kane as long as you both live...

260
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:28,835
...and thereafter to the survivor.

261
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,379
- Let's hope it's all for the best.
- It is.

262
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,818
Why I can't raise my own boy
is more than I can understand.

263
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,754
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

264
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,986
Everything else, the principal,
as well as all monies earned...

265
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:50,156
...is to be administered by the bank in trust
for your son, Charles Foster Kane...

266
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:52,962
...until he reaches his 25th birthday,
at which time...

267
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:55,332
...he is to come into complete possession.

268
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:56,701
Charles!

269
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:00,366
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

270
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,139
It's almost 5:00.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?

271
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:07,882
I've got his trunk all packed.

272
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:11,245
I've had it packed for a week now.

273
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:16,289
I've arranged for a tutor
to meet us in Chicago.

274
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,690
I'd have brought him here with me, but...

275
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:21,157
- Charles.
- Look, Mom.

276
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,763
You'd better come inside.

277
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,767
- That's quite a snowman.
- I took the pipe out of his mouth.

278
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:27,392
Did you make it yourself?

279
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:29,994
Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.

280
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:32,364
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

281
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:34,834
- Hello.
- How do you do, Charles?

282
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,502
He comes from the East.

283
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:38,045
- Pa.
- Hello, Charlie.

284
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:39,375
Charles.

285
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:41,514
Yes, Mommy.

286
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,146
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you
on a trip with him tonight.

287
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,916
You'll be leaving on number 10.

288
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,220
That's the train with all the lights on it.

289
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,316
You going, Mom?

290
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,624
No. Your mother won't be going
right away, but she'll...

291
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,025
Where am I going?

292
00:21:57,132 --> 00:22:00,898
You're going to see Chicago and New York
and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?

293
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:02,163
He certainly is.

294
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,638
I wish I were a boy going on a trip
like that for the first time.

295
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:08,938
- Why aren't you coming with us, Mom?
- We have to stay here, Charles.

296
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,912
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher
from now on, Charlie.

297
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,438
You're gonna be rich. Your ma figures,
well, that is...

298
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,812
...me and her decided this ain't the place
for you to grow up in.

299
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,321
You'll probably be
the richest man someday...

300
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,858
...and you ought to get...
- You won't be lonely.

301
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,418
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have
fine times together, we are.

302
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:30,397
Let's shake hands. Come.
I'm not that frightening, am I?

303
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,998
- What do you say? Let's shake.
- Why, Charles.

304
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:34,865
- Why, you almost hurt me.
- Charlie!

305
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,462
Sleds aren't to hit people,
but to sleigh with.

306
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:38,528
Mom!

307
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,868
- You got to go.
- Jim!

308
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,043
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.

309
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,943
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.

310
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:46,878
- That's what you think, is it?
- Yes.

311
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:51,283
That's why he's going to be brought up
where you can't get at him.

312
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:13,338
Well, Charles...

313
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,877
...Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

314
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,548
And a happy New Year.

315
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:21,910
In closing...

316
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,818
...may I remind you your 25th birthday,
which is now approaching...

317
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:28,652
...marks your complete independence
from the firm...

318
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:32,285
...of Thatcher & Company,
as well as acquiring the full responsibility...

319
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:34,795
...for the world's sixth largest
private fortune.

320
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,924
<i>- Got that?
- "The world's sixth largest private fortune. "</i>

321
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:42,162
I don't think you realize the full importance
of the position you are to occupy.

322
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:44,501
I am therefore enclosing
for your consideration...

323
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:47,303
...a list of your holdings,
extensively cross-indexed.

324
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:49,571
<i>- "Dear Mr. Thatcher. "
- It's from Mr. Kane.</i>

325
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:52,011
<i>- Go on.
- "Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...</i>

326
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,139
<i>"... oil wells, shipping or real estate. "</i>

327
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,476
Not interested?

328
00:23:56,618 --> 00:24:00,019
<i>"One item on your list intrigues me:
The New York Inquirer.</i>

329
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:02,989
<i>"A little newspaper we acquired
in a foreclosure proceeding.</i>

330
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:05,492
<i>"Don't sell it.

<i>"I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper.</i>

332
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:12,193
<i>"I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper. "</i>

333
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:22,169
<i>"Traction Trust exposed. "</i>

00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:24,905
<i>"Traction Trust bleeds public white. "</i>

335
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,347
<i>"Traction Trust smashed by Inquirer. "</i>

336
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:31,853
<i>"Landlords refuse to clear slums. "</i>

337
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:35,884
<i>"Inquirer wins slum fight. "</i>

338
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:41,162
<i>"Wall Street backs copper swindle. "</i>

339
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,391
<i>"Copper robbers indicted. "</i>

340

<i>"Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast. "</i>

341
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:49,062
Is that really your idea
of how to run a newspaper?

342
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:52,573
I don't know how to run a newspaper.
I try everything I can think of.

343
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:55,610
You know there's not
the slightest proof this...

344
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:58,612
...Armada's off the Jersey Coast.
- Hello, Mr. Bernstein.

345
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,113
Can you prove it isn't?

346
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:02,912
Mr. Bernstein,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.

347
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:04,845
- Mr. Leland.
- Hello.

348
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,649
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.

349
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:11,887
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.

350
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:15,828
<i>He knows what's wrong with every copy
of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.</i>

351
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:18,957
<i>"Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop.
Could send you prose poems...</i>

352
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:22,834
<i>"... about scenery but don't feel right
spending your money. Stop.</i>

353
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:25,771
<i>"There is no war in Cuba. "
Signed "Wheeler. " Any answer?</i>

354
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:30,369
Yes. Dear Wheeler: You provide
the prose poems, I'll provide the war.

355
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:33,175
- That's fine.
- I like it myself. Send it right away.

356
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:35,648
I came to see you
about this campaign of yours.

357
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:38,584
<i>The Inquirer's campaign against
the Public Transit Company.</i>

358
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:40,849
Do you know anything
we can use against them?

359
00:25:40,922 --> 00:25:42,549
You're still the college boy, eh?

360
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,287
I was expelled from college, a lot
of colleges, you remember? I remember.

361
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:50,193
I think I should remind you of a fact
you have forgotten.

362
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:54,133
You're one of the largest stockholders
in the Public Transit Company.

363
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:57,262
The trouble is, you don't realize
you're talking to two people.

364
00:25:57,372 --> 00:26:00,535
As Charles Foster Kane
who owns 82,364 shares...

365
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:04,409
...of Public Transit Preferred. See,
I do have a general idea of my holdings.

366
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,947
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel...

367
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:10,343
...his paper should be closed,
a committee formed to boycott him.

368
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:14,218
If you can form such a committee,
put me down for a contribution of $1,000.

369
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:17,156
<i>On the other hand,
I am the publisher of the Inquirer.</i>

370
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:21,321
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in
on a little secret. It is also my pleasure...

371
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,728
...to see that the working people of this
community aren't robbed by a pack...

372
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:28,327
...of money-mad pirates, just because...

373
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,933
...they have no one
to look after their interests.

374
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,333
I'll let you in on another little secret,
Mr. Thatcher:

375
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:39,278
I think I'm the man to do it.
You see, I have money and property.

376
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:43,341
If I don't look after the interests
of the underprivileged, somebody else will.

377
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:45,511
Maybe somebody
without money or property.

378
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:46,884
That would be too bad.

379
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:49,082
I saw your financial statement today.

380
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:52,126
- Oh, did you?
- Tell me, honestly...

381
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:56,627
...don't you think it's rather unwise
to continue this philanthropic enterprise...

382
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,758
<i>...this Inquirer, that is costing you
$1 million a year?</i>

383
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:04,670
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year.

384
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,402
I expect to lose $1 million next year.

385
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:09,739
At the rate of $1 million a year...

386
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:13,373
...I'll have to close this place in 60 years.

387
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:25,592
<i>"With respect to the said newspapers...</i>

388
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,128
<i>"... the said Charles Foster Kane...</i>

389
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:31,791
<i>"... hereby relinquishes all control thereof...</i>

390
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,964
<i>"... and of the syndicates

391
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:41,100
<i>"... and any and all other newspaper, press
and publishing properties of any kind...</i>

392
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,942
<i>"... and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto... "</i>

393
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:47,379
- Which means we're bust all right.
- Well, out of cash.

394
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:49,006
All right, Mr. Bernstein.

395
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:53,646
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher,
just let me sign it and go home.

396
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:57,055
You're too old
to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

397
00:27:57,192 --> 00:28:00,184
You're too old to be called anything else.

398
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,457
You were always too old.

399
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,795
<i>"In consideration thereof,
Thatcher & Company agrees...</i>

400
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:09,735
<i>"... to pay to Charles Foster Kane,
as long as he lives... "</i>

401
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,398
My allowance.

402
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:15,374
<i>"You will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large...</i>

403
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:20,177
<i>"... measure of control.
Measure of control. "</i>

404
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:23,912
And we shall seek your advice.

405
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:30,355
This depression is temporary.

406
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:35,359
There's always the chance
that you'll die richer than I will.

407
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,064
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.

408
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,624
We never lost as much as we made.

409
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:45,196
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles...

410
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:50,540
...you never made a single investment.
You always used money to...

411
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:53,238
To buy things.

412
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:58,783
To buy things.

413
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:03,680
My mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker.

414
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:14,265
I always gagged on that silver spoon.

415
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,238
You know, Mr. Bernstein...

416
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:22,671
...if I hadn't been very rich...

417
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:25,577
...I might have been a really great man.

418
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:27,808
Don't you think you are?

419
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:33,015
I think I did pretty well
under the circumstances.

420
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,256
What would you like to have been?

421
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:42,393
Everything you hate.

422
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:54,069
I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?

423
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:57,942
- It's 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
- Yes, ma'am.

424
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,673
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege,
young man.

425
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:03,775
- Did you find what you were looking for?
- No.

426
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,246
- You're not Rosebud, are you?
- What?

427
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:11,315
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings,
isn't it?

428
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:15,896
Goodbye, everybody.
Thanks for the use of the hall.

429
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:20,192
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.

430
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:22,736
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know?

431
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:27,003
We thought maybe... If we could
find out what he meant by his last words...

432
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,600
<i>...as he was dying.
- That "Rosebud"?</i>

433
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:32,179
Maybe some girl?

434
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,477
There were a lot of them in the early days.

435
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:37,780
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane
could have met someone casually...

436
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:40,116
...and then 50 years later, on his deathbed...

437
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:44,989
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.

438
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:48,822
A fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldn't think he'd remember.

439
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:50,660
You take me.

440
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:55,795
One day, back in 1896,
I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry...

441
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:59,168
...and as we pulled out,
there was another ferry pulling in...

442
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,038
...and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off.

443
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:04,675
A white dress she had on.

444
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,214
She was carrying a white parasol.

445
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:10,006
I only saw her for one second.

446
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:15,546
She didn't see me at all,
but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since...

447
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:18,984
...that I haven't thought of that girl.

448
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:23,726
- Who else have you been to see?
- Well, I went down to Atlantic City.

449
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,732
Susie?

450
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:27,165
Thank you.

451
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:30,602
I called her myself the day after he died.

452
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:33,339
I thought maybe somebody ought to.

453
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:38,943
- She couldn't even come to the phone.
- I'll be seeing her again in a couple of days.

454
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:41,005
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.

455
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:44,878
If you'd talk about anything connected
with Mr. Kane that you can remember.

456
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:46,887
You were with him from the beginning.

457
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:52,359
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.

458
00:31:53,395 --> 00:31:55,795
Have you tried to see anybody
except Susie?

459
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:00,164
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've
been through Walter Thatcher's journal.

460
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:04,763
- That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
- He made an awful lot of money.

461
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:07,604
Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money...

462
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:13,342
...if all you want is to make a lot of money.

463
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:21,253
You take Mr. Kane.
It wasn't money he wanted.

464
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:27,689
Thatcher never did figure him out.
Sometimes even I couldn't.

465
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,263
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.

466
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:34,526
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend.
They went to school together.

467
00:32:34,602 --> 00:32:35,796
Harvard?

468
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,567
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell, Switzerland.

469
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:42,269
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.

470
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,138
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.

471
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:48,473
One of those families
where the father is worth $10 million...

472
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,850
...then one day he shoots himself,
and it turns out there's nothing but debts.

473
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,752
He was with Mr. Kane and me...

474
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:00,694
<i>...the first day Mr. Kane took over
the Inquirer.</i>

475
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,837
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.

476
00:33:11,106 --> 00:33:14,974
It's going to look a lot different
one of these days. Come on.

477
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:27,051
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint.
That's a newspaper building.

478
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:31,923
You're getting paid, mister,
for opinions or for hauling?

479
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:37,630
- Jedediah.
- After you, Mr. Kane.

480
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:52,074
Excuse me, sir, but I...

481
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:57,382
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

482
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:02,217
<i>Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.</i>

483
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,588
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.

484
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:08,561
- Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland...
- How do you do, Mr. Leland?

485
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,565
Our new dramatic critic.
I hope I haven't made a mistake.

486
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,828
- It is dramatic critic, right?
- That's right.

487
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:17,530
- Are they standing for me?
- You? Oh, Mr. Kane.

488
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:18,903
Standing?

489
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,600
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

490
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:23,041
I thought it would be a nice little gesture.

491
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:26,239
- Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
- The new publisher.

492
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:30,683
- You may resume your duties, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

493
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:34,119
- I didn't know your plans.
- I don't know my plans myself.

494
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:36,754
- Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans.
- No?

495
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:39,817
Except to get out a newspaper.

496
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:46,464
- Mr. Bernstein.
- Yes, Mr. Kane.

497
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:48,900
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.

498
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:53,997
- Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
- How do you do, Mr. Carter?

499
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:55,975
- Mr. Carter.
- How do you do?

500
00:34:56,978 --> 00:34:59,310
- Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
- Stein.

501
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,043
- Kane.
- Mr. Carter, is this your office?

502
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:07,281
My little private sanctum
is at your disposal.

503
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,756
- Excuse me.
- But I don't think I understand.

504
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,152
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here
in your office as long as I have to.

505
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:18,232
Live here? Yes?

506
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:21,291
- Excuse me.
- But a morning newspaper, after all...

507
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,199
Excuse me.

508
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,138
We're practically closed for 12 hours a day.

509
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:29,569
That's one of the things
that's going to have to be changed here.

510
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:33,205
- The news goes on for 24 hours a day.
- 24?

511
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:36,681
- That's right.
- Excuse me.

512
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,446
It's impossible...

513
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:43,547
I've drawn that cartoon.
I'm no good as a cartoonist.

514
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:45,217
You certainly aren't.

515
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:47,124
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.

516
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:49,163
- You still eating?
- I'm still hungry.

517
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,721
<i>Here's a front-page story in the Chronicle...</i>

518
00:35:51,766 --> 00:35:54,894
...about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone
in Brooklyn who's missing.

519
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:59,633
<i>She's probably murdered. Why isn't
there something about it in the Inquirer?</i>

520
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:01,504
We're running a newspaper...

521
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,511
- I'm absolutely starving to death.
... not a scandal sheet.

522
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,641
That's all right.

523
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:10,707
<i>Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline
in the Chronicle.</i>

524
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:13,345
<i>Why hasn't the Inquirer
a three-column headline?</i>

525
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,854
The news wasn't big enough.

526
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:19,690
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough,
it makes the news big enough.

527
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,389
- That's right!
- The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone...

528
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:24,658
There's no proof
that she was murdered, or dead.

529
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:27,599
It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.

530
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:30,570
It's not our function
to report the gossip of housewives.

531
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:34,836
If we were interested in that kind of thing,
we could fill the paper twice over, daily.

532
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:38,310
That's the kind of thing we are going to be
interested in from now on.

533
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:41,371
I want you to send your best man
to see Mr. Silverstone.

534
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,317
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't
produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone...

535
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:47,479
<i>...the Inquirer will have him arrested.</i>

536
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:50,046
Tell Mr. Silverstone
he's a detective from...

537
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,592
- Central Office.
- The Central Office.

538
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,422
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious
and asks to see your man's badge...

539
00:36:57,498 --> 00:37:01,332
...your man is to get indignant
and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.

540
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:04,766
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear.
You ready for dinner, Jedediah?

541
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,138
I can't see that the function
of a respectable newspaper...

542
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:11,370
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter. Goodbye.

543
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:13,208
Goodbye.

544
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:16,782
Paper! Read all about it!

545
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,920
<i>Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.</i>

546
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,479
The mystery of the lady
that vanished in Brooklyn.

547
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:26,418
<i>Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.</i>

548
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:43,703
We'll be on the street soon,
Charlie, another 10 minutes.

549
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:46,541
Three hours and 50 minutes late,
but we did it.

550
00:37:46,614 --> 00:37:48,172
- Tired?
- A tough day.

551
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:49,841
- A wasted day.
- Wasted?

552
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:52,852
You only made the paper over
four times tonight, that's all.

553
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:56,579
I've changed the front page a little,
Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.

554
00:37:56,657 --> 00:38:00,855
There's something I've got to get into
this paper besides pictures and print.

555
00:38:01,462 --> 00:38:04,590
<i>I've got to make the New York Inquirer
as important to New York...</i>

556
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:06,565
...as the gas in that light.

557
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,964
What are you going to do, Charlie?

558
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:13,235
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.

559
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:16,132
I've got it all written out here.

560
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:19,703
You don't want to make any promises
you don't want to keep.

561
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:21,476
These'll be kept.

562
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,784
<i>"I'll provide the people of this city...</i>

563
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:28,747
<i>"... with a daily paper
that will tell all the news honestly.</i>

564
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:33,358
<i>- "I will also provide... "
- That's two sentences starting with "I."</i>

565
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:35,988
People will know who's responsible...

566
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:40,160
<i>...and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer,
quickly, simply and entertainingly.</i>

567
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,601
No special interests will be allowed
to interfere with that truth.

568
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:47,573
<i>"I will also provide them with a fighting
and tireless champion of their rights...</i>

569
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:50,270
<i>"... as citizens and as human beings. "</i>

570
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,243
Signed:

571
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:55,207
<i>"Charles Foster Kane. "</i>

572
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:59,813
- Can I have that, Charlie?
- I'm going to print it.

573
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:01,354
Solly!

574
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:03,448
Yes, Mr. Kane?

575
00:39:03,524 --> 00:39:06,391
I want you to run this editorial
in a box on the front page.

576
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:07,928
This morning's front page?

577
00:39:07,995 --> 00:39:11,055
That's right, Solly,
that means we'll have to remake again.

578
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:12,962
- Yes.
- Go down and tell them.

579
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:14,399
All right.

580
00:39:14,669 --> 00:39:18,366
When you're through with that,
I'd like to have it back.

581
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:23,374
I'd like to keep that particular
piece of paper myself.

582
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:27,505
I have a hunch it might turn out
to be something pretty important.

583
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,943
- A document...
- Sure.

584
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:33,475
...like the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution...

585
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:36,780
...and my first report card at school.

586
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:08,419
I know you're tired, gentlemen,
but I brought you here for a reason.

587
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,118
<i>- This little pilgrimage will do us good.
- The Chronicle's a good newspaper.</i>

588
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:15,320
<i>Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper.
Notice the circulation.</i>

589
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:20,299
<i>495,000.
But look who's working for the Chronicle.</i>

590
00:40:20,368 --> 00:40:23,565
- With them, it's no trick to get circulation.
- You're right.

591
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:27,036
<i>You know how long it took the Chronicle
to get that staff together?</i>

592
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:29,872
- Twenty years.
- Twenty years?

593
00:40:30,444 --> 00:40:35,541
Six years ago, I looked at a picture
of the world's greatest newspaper men.

594
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:37,811
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store.

595
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:41,878
Tonight, six years later,
I got my candy, all of it.

596
00:40:42,456 --> 00:40:44,424
<i>Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.</i>

597
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:47,586
<i>Make an extra copy of that picture
and mail it to the Chronicle.</i>

598
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,598
It'll make you all happy to learn
that our circulation this morning...

599
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,465
...was the greatest in New York: 684,000.

600
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:59,963
684,132.

601
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,402
Right.

602
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:05,640
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness
in taking leave of you.

603
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,147
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation.

604
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,777
I've promised my doctor for sometime
that I would leave when I could.

605
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,820
I now realize I can't.

606
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,982
Say, Mr. Kane,
as long as you're promising...

607
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,994
...there's a lot of pictures and statues
in Europe you ain't bought yet.

608
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:23,062
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.

609
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:26,159
They've been making statues
for 2,000 years.

610
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,361
And I've only been buying for five.

611
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:30,961
- Promise me, Mr. Kane.
- I promise, Mr. Bernstein.

612
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:33,871
- Thank you.
- Mr. Bernstein?

613
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:37,206
You don't expect me to keep
any of those promises, do you?

614
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:41,106
And now, gentlemen!

615
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:44,447
Your complete attention, if you please.

616
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:53,452
Are we going to declare war on Spain?

617
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,796
Oh, mama, here they come.
Shoot me while I'm happy.

618
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,282
<i>I said, "Are we going to declare
war on Spain, or are we not? "</i>

619
00:42:18,386 --> 00:42:20,217
<i>The Inquirer already has.</i>

620
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:24,388
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.

621
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,388
I'm not overdressed.

622
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:29,724
You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.

623
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,924
Let's have the song about Charlie.

624
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:35,435
- Is there a song about Charlie?
- Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?

625
00:42:35,503 --> 00:42:39,803
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town,
you get a song written about you.

626
00:42:49,684 --> 00:42:51,982
I've seen that fellow. He's good.

627
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:53,619
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

628
00:42:53,688 --> 00:42:56,657

He likes good old Charlie Kane"</i>

00:43:49,744 --> 00:43:52,770
- Isn't it wonderful? Such a party.
- Yes.

640
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:54,610

- No, the brunette.
- Where did you learn that, Charlie?

00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:28,510
<i>Bernstein, these men
who were with the Chronicle...</i>

652
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,642
<i>...weren't they just as devoted
to the Chronicle policy...</i>

653
00:44:31,786 --> 00:44:33,947
...as they are now to our policies?

654
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:36,784
Sure, they're just like anybody else.

655
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:39,083
They got work to do, they do it.

656
00:44:39,393 --> 00:44:42,362
Only they happen to be
the best men in the business.

657
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:55,004
<i>Do we stand for the same things
the Chronicle stands for?</i>

658
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:56,972
Certainly not.

659
00:44:57,978 --> 00:45:03,041
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed
to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

660
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:07,051
There's always a chance, of course,
that they'll change Mr. Kane.

661
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:09,120
Without his knowing it.

662
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:16,153
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!

663
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,294
- I got a cable here from Mr. Kane.
- What?

664
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:23,302
- From Paris, France.
- What?

665
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:26,373
- From Paris, France.
- Come on in.

666
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:32,245
<i>"Who by his action
has the traction magnates on the run"</i>

667
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,711
It's a good thing he promised
not to send back any more statues.

668
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:41,783
Look, he wants to buy
the world's biggest diamond.

669
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,383
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to.

670
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:48,189
I wanted Charlie to have fun,
with me along...

671
00:45:48,362 --> 00:45:50,592
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?

672
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:55,328
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?

673
00:45:56,103 --> 00:45:57,400
Yes.

674
00:45:58,706 --> 00:46:03,234
If you thought I'd answer you different
from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.

675
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,777
<i>"World's biggest diamond. "</i>

676
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:07,178
I didn't know Charlie
was collecting diamonds.

677
00:46:07,248 --> 00:46:08,772
He ain't.

678
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,046
He's collecting somebody
that's collecting diamonds.

679
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,648
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.

680
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:19,784
<i>"Welcome home, Mr. Kane...</i>

681
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,660
<i>"... from 467 employees
of the New York Inquirer. "</i>

682
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:25,221
Here he comes!

683
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:31,067
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

684
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,737
- I know I've a moustache.
- It looks awful.

685
00:46:33,774 --> 00:46:37,369
Have we got a society editor?

686
00:46:37,444 --> 00:46:40,379
- Right here, Mr. Kane.
- Miss Townsend is the society editor.

687
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:43,143
Miss Townsend,
this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.

688
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,448
Miss Townsend, I've been away so long.
I don't know your routine.

689
00:46:49,623 --> 00:46:52,751
I got a little social announcement.

690
00:46:52,793 --> 00:46:56,786
I wish you wouldn't treat this
any differently than you would any other...

691
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:58,658
...social announcement.

692
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:02,326
<i>Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees
of the Inquirer...</i>

693
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:05,930
Mr. Bernstein,
thank you very much, everybody, I...

694
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,936
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.

695
00:47:11,111 --> 00:47:12,578
Goodbye.

696
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,442
Say, he was in an awful hurry.

697
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,544
Hey, everybody, look out here.

698
00:47:18,686 --> 00:47:20,654
Let's go to the window.

699
00:47:20,854 --> 00:47:23,789
- Mr. Leland! Mr. Bernstein!
- Yes, Ms. Townsend?

700
00:47:23,824 --> 00:47:26,725
<i>This announcement:
"Mr. And Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton...</i>

701
00:47:26,794 --> 00:47:30,321
<i>"... announce the engagement
of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...</i>

702
00:47:30,397 --> 00:47:32,160
<i>"... to Mr. Charles Foster Kane. "</i>

703
00:47:32,232 --> 00:47:33,790
Come on.

704
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:41,139
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece
of the President of the United States.

705
00:47:41,342 --> 00:47:43,242
President's niece?

706
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:46,843
Before he's through,
she'll be a president's wife.

707
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:58,623
The way things turned out,
I don't need to tell you.

708
00:47:58,726 --> 00:48:01,422
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.

709
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:03,621
It didn't end very well, did it?

710
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:05,326
It ended.

711
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:09,925
Then there was Susie. That ended, too.

712
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:14,867
You know, Mr. Thompson, I was thinking...

713
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:18,610
...this Rosebud
you're trying to find out about...

714
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:21,178
Yes?

715
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:27,986
Maybe that was something he lost.

716
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:32,189
Mr. Kane was a man who lost
almost everything he had.

717
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,124
You ought to see Jed Leland.

718
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:38,392
Of course, he and Mr. Kane
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

719
00:48:38,465 --> 00:48:40,456
You take the Spanish-American war.

720
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:43,901
I guess Mr. Leland was right.
That was Mr. Kane's war.

721
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:46,963
We didn't really have anything
to fight about.

722
00:48:47,775 --> 00:48:51,336
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war
of Mr. Kane's...

723
00:48:51,645 --> 00:48:54,409
...we'd have the Panama Canal?

724
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:57,540
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.

725
00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:01,315
A lot of the time now
they don't tell me these things.

726
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:04,454
Maybe even he's dead.

727
00:49:04,558 --> 00:49:06,287
In case you'd like to know...

728
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,329
...he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital
on 180th Street.

729
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:10,886
You don't say. I had...

730
00:49:10,964 --> 00:49:13,865
Nothing particular the matter with him,
they tell me, just...

731
00:49:13,934 --> 00:49:16,528
Just old age.

732
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:22,741
It's the only disease that you don't
look forward to being cured of.

733
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,755
I can remember absolutely everything,
young man.

734
00:49:37,825 --> 00:49:39,122
That's my curse.

735
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:43,755
That's one of the greatest curses
ever inflicted on the human race: Memory.

736
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:49,567
I was his oldest friend, and as far as
I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.

737
00:49:49,803 --> 00:49:53,899
Not that Charlie was ever brutal.
He just did brutal things.

738
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:58,941
Maybe I wasn't his friend,
but if I wasn't, he never had one.

739
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:02,774
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

740
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:05,249
You were about to say something
about Rosebud.

741
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:07,549
Do you happen to have a good cigar?

742
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:11,489
I've got a young physician here
who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.

743
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:13,856
No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry.

744
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:15,889
I changed the subject, didn't I?

745
00:50:15,963 --> 00:50:18,431
What a disagreeable old man
I have become.

746
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:24,201
You're a reporter and you want to know
what I think about Charlie Kane.

747
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:30,166
I suppose he had some private sort
of greatness.

748
00:50:30,244 --> 00:50:31,973
But he kept it to himself.

749
00:50:32,045 --> 00:50:35,014
He never gave himself away.
He never gave anything away.

750
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:38,074
He just left you a tip.

751
00:50:39,553 --> 00:50:40,952
He had a generous mind.

752
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:44,218
I don't suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions.

753
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:47,221
But he never believed in anything
except Charlie Kane.

754
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,923
He never had a conviction
except Charlie Kane in his life.

755
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:53,428
I suppose he died without one.

756
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,161
That must have been pretty unpleasant.

757
00:50:56,503 --> 00:51:01,167
Of course, a lot of us check out without
having any special convictions about death.

758
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:04,506
But we do know what we're leaving.
We do believe in something.

759
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:08,239
Are you absolutely sure
you haven't got a cigar?

760
00:51:08,382 --> 00:51:10,373
- Sorry, Mr. Leland.
- Never mind.

761
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:14,079
<i>- What do you know about Rosebud?
- "Rosebud"?</i>

762
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:18,286
<i>His dying words: "Rosebud. "</i>

763
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,718
<i>I saw that in the Inquirer.</i>

764
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:24,720
<i>I never believed anything
I saw in the Inquirer.</i>

765
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:26,231
Anything else?

766
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,997
I can tell you about Emily.
I went to dancing school with Emily.

767
00:51:30,404 --> 00:51:32,167
I was very graceful.

768
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,507
- We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
- What was she like?

769
00:51:36,577 --> 00:51:39,102
She was like all the girls I knew
in dancing school.

770
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,205
Very nice girl. Emily was a little nicer.

771
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,743
After the first couple of months...

772
00:51:45,786 --> 00:51:50,120
...she and Charlie didn't see much
of each other except at breakfast.

773
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:53,453
It was a marriage
just like any other marriage.

774
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,365
- You're beautiful.
- I can't be.

775
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:07,202
Yes, you are. You're very beautiful.

776
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:09,799
I've never been to six parties
in one night before.

777
00:52:10,077 --> 00:52:12,807
- I've never been up this late.
- It's a matter of habit.

778
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,849
- What will the servants think?
- That we enjoyed ourselves.

779
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:18,474
Why do you have to go straight off
to the newspaper?

780
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:22,249
You never should've married a
newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.

781
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:25,090
I absolutely adore you.

782
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,828
Charles, even newspapermen
have to sleep.

783
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:33,766
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him
put off my appointments till noon.

784
00:52:35,102 --> 00:52:36,194
What time is it?

785
00:52:36,803 --> 00:52:38,498
I don't know. It's late.

786
00:52:40,807 --> 00:52:42,775
It's early.

787
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:44,605
Charles...

788
00:52:45,212 --> 00:52:48,181
Do you know how long
you kept me waiting last night...

789
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,081
...when you went to the newspaper
for 10 minutes?

790
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:54,515
What do you do in a newspaper
in the middle of the night?

791
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:59,649
<i>My dear, your only correspondent
is the Inquirer.</i>

792
00:52:59,726 --> 00:53:02,524
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival
of flesh and blood.

793
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,156
I don't spend that much time
on the newspaper.

794
00:53:05,232 --> 00:53:09,328
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the President.

795
00:53:09,403 --> 00:53:12,634
- You mean Uncle John.
- I mean the President of the United States.

796
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:15,174
He's still Uncle John
and a well-meaning fathead...

797
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:18,643
...who's letting a pack of high-pressure
crooks run his administration.

798
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:22,512
- This whole oil scandal...
- He happens to be the President, not you.

799
00:53:22,582 --> 00:53:25,415
That's a mistake that will be corrected
one of these days.

800
00:53:25,485 --> 00:53:30,752
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior
the most incredible atrocity yesterday.

801
00:53:31,725 --> 00:53:34,421
I simply can't have it in the nursery.

802
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,795
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit
to the nursery now and then.

803
00:53:39,866 --> 00:53:41,493
Does he have to?

804
00:53:42,536 --> 00:53:43,594
Yes.

805
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:48,141
- Really, Charles, people will think...
- What I tell them to think.

806
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:08,952
Wasn't he ever in love with her?

807
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,891
He married for love.

808
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:13,197
Love.

809
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,597
That is why he did everything.

810
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,638
That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough.

811
00:54:18,705 --> 00:54:21,765
He wanted all the voters to love him, too.

812
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:24,933
All he wanted out of life was love.

813
00:54:25,779 --> 00:54:28,976
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.

814
00:54:29,216 --> 00:54:32,413
You see, he just didn't have any to give.

815
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,218
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.

816
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,223
Very dearly.

817
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:41,189
And his mother,
I guess he always loved her.

818
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:44,321
- How about his second wife?
- Susan Alexander?

819
00:54:45,098 --> 00:54:47,259
You know what Charlie called her?

820
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:50,231
The day after he'd met her,
he told me about her.

821
00:54:50,404 --> 00:54:55,307
<i>He said she was
"a cross-section of the American public. "</i>

822
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:01,173
I guess he couldn't help it.
She must have had something for him.

823
00:55:01,314 --> 00:55:04,044
That first night, according to Charlie...

824
00:55:05,152 --> 00:55:07,518
...all she had was a toothache.

825
00:55:38,676 --> 00:55:41,167
What are you laughing at, young lady?

826
00:55:43,047 --> 00:55:45,845
- What's the matter with you?
- Toothache.

827
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:47,679
- What?
- Toothache.

828
00:55:47,751 --> 00:55:49,048
Toothache?

829
00:55:52,523 --> 00:55:54,548
You mean you've got a toothache.

830
00:55:55,459 --> 00:55:58,360
- What's funny about that?
- You're funny, mister.

831
00:55:58,429 --> 00:56:00,989
- You've got dirt on your face.
- Not dirt, it's mud.

832
00:56:01,065 --> 00:56:03,397
Do you want some hot water?
I live right here.

833
00:56:03,467 --> 00:56:05,435
What's that, young lady?

834
00:56:06,704 --> 00:56:09,104
I said, if you wanted some hot water...

835
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,604
...I could get you some... hot water.

836
00:56:17,181 --> 00:56:19,513
All right, thank you very much.

837
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:35,832
Do I look any better now?

838
00:56:35,899 --> 00:56:40,632
- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
- What you need is to get your mind off it.

839
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:48,903
Excuse me, but my landlady
prefers me to keep this door open...

840
00:56:49,146 --> 00:56:52,138
...when I have a gentleman caller.
- All right.

841
00:56:52,216 --> 00:56:54,309
You have got a toothache, haven't you?

842
00:56:54,418 --> 00:56:57,478
- I surely have.
- Why don't you try laughing at me again?

843
00:56:57,554 --> 00:56:59,522
- What?
- I'm still pretty funny.

844
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,150
I know, but you don't want me
to laugh at you.

845
00:57:02,226 --> 00:57:04,285
I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.

846
00:57:04,395 --> 00:57:05,692
Look at me.

847
00:57:06,096 --> 00:57:07,222
See that?

848
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,663
What are you doing?

849
00:57:08,732 --> 00:57:11,200
I'm wiggling both my ears
at the same time.

850
00:57:13,404 --> 00:57:15,167
That's it, smile.

851
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:21,709
It took me two solid years at the best
boys' school in the world to learn that.

852
00:57:21,779 --> 00:57:24,942
The fellow who taught me
is now president of Venezuela.

853
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:28,316
That's it!

854
00:57:32,122 --> 00:57:34,750
- Is it a giraffe?
- No, not a giraffe.

855
00:57:34,825 --> 00:57:37,726
- I bet it is.
- What?

856
00:57:37,795 --> 00:57:39,922
Well, then it's an elephant.

857
00:57:40,064 --> 00:57:43,830
- It's supposed to be a rooster.
- A rooster!

858
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:48,135
You know an awful lot of tricks.
Are you a professional magician?

859
00:57:48,205 --> 00:57:50,833
- No, I'm not a magician.
- I was just joking.

860
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:52,569
You really don't know who I am?

861
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:55,737
You told me your name, Mr. Kane,
but I'm awfully ignorant.

862
00:57:55,813 --> 00:58:00,273
I guess you caught on to that.
I bet I've heard your name a million times.

863
00:58:00,484 --> 00:58:03,578
You really like me, though,
even though you don't know who I am?

864
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:07,090
I surely do. You've been wonderful.

865
00:58:08,158 --> 00:58:10,922
Without you I don't know
what I would have done.

866
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:14,294
I had a toothache,
and I don't know many people.

867
00:58:14,631 --> 00:58:16,531
I know too many people.

868
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:18,959
I guess we're both lonely.

869
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:23,228
Want to know what I was going to do
before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?

870
00:58:23,307 --> 00:58:26,606
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.
You probably have more.

871
00:58:26,677 --> 00:58:27,871
I was just joking.

872
00:58:29,613 --> 00:58:33,549
I was on my way
to the Western Manhattan Warehouse...

873
00:58:33,617 --> 00:58:35,642
...in search of my youth.

874
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,316
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West.

875
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,883
There wasn't any other place to put them.

876
00:58:43,927 --> 00:58:47,988
I thought I'd send for them now.
Tonight I was going to take a look at them.

877
00:58:48,065 --> 00:58:50,295
A sort of sentimental journey.

878
00:58:53,904 --> 00:58:56,202
I run a couple of newspapers.
What do you do?

879
00:58:56,273 --> 00:58:57,297
Me?

880
00:58:57,608 --> 00:58:59,838
- How old did you say you were?
- I didn't say.

881
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,606
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.

882
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:03,907
- How old?
- Pretty old.

883
00:59:03,981 --> 00:59:06,074
- How old?
- Twenty-two in August.

884
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,175
That's a ripe old age. What do you do?

885
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:11,744
I work at Seligman's.
I'm in charge of the sheet music.

886
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:16,619
- Is that what you want to do?
- No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.

887
00:59:17,327 --> 00:59:20,922
- That is, I didn't. My mother did for me.
- What happened to the singing?

888
00:59:20,998 --> 00:59:25,025
Mother always thought, she always talked
about grand opera for me.

889
00:59:25,102 --> 00:59:26,330
Imagine.

890
00:59:26,637 --> 00:59:30,869
But my voice isn't that kind.
It's just, you know what mothers are like.

891
00:59:32,643 --> 00:59:33,871
Yes.

892
00:59:35,913 --> 00:59:38,711
- Have you got a piano?
- A piano?

893
00:59:39,683 --> 00:59:41,446
Yes, there's one in the parlor.

894
00:59:41,552 --> 00:59:44,612
- Would you sing for me?
- You wouldn't want to hear me sing.

895
00:59:44,688 --> 00:59:46,053
Yes, I would.

896
00:59:47,858 --> 00:59:50,088
Don't tell me
your toothache is bothering you.

897
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,923
No, that's all gone.

898
00:59:53,664 --> 00:59:55,632
All right.

899
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,329
Let's go to the parlor.

900
00:59:58,402 --> 01:00:04,204
<i>"Yes, Lindor shall be mine</i>

901
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:09,134
<i>"I have sworn it</i>

902
01:00:10,013 --> 01:00:12,880
<i>"For weal or woe</i>

903
01:00:14,952 --> 01:00:17,716
<i>"Yes, Lindor</i>

904
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:27,794
<i>"Lo giurai</i>

905
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:33,068
<i>"La vincer"</i>

906
01:00:41,111 --> 01:00:43,602
There is only one man
who can rid the politics...

907
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,945
...of this state of the evil domination
of Boss Jim Gettys.

908
01:00:47,017 --> 01:00:50,919
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane,
the fighting liberal...

909
01:00:50,988 --> 01:00:54,549
...the friend of the workingman,
the next governor of this state...

910
01:00:54,658 --> 01:00:56,888
...who entered upon this campaign...

911
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,928
<i>...with one purpose only:</i>

912
01:00:58,996 --> 01:01:03,365
<i>To point out
and make public the dishonesty...</i>

913
01:01:03,634 --> 01:01:08,401
<i>...the downright villainy
of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine...</i>

914
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:13,039
<i>...now in complete control
of the government of this state.</i>

915
01:01:13,477 --> 01:01:17,243
<i>I made no campaign promises...</i>

916
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:22,377
<i>...because. Until a few weeks ago.
I had no hope of being elected.</i>

917
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:28,185
<i>Now. However. I have something more
than a hope.</i>

918
01:01:31,428 --> 01:01:33,953
<i>Jim Gettys has something less
than a chance.</i>

919
01:01:38,368 --> 01:01:40,268
<i>Every straw vote...</i>

920
01:01:40,437 --> 01:01:45,272
<i>...every independent poll shows
that I will be elected.</i>

921
01:01:45,742 --> 01:01:47,403
<i>Very well.</i>

922
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:50,342
<i>Now I can afford to make some promises.</i>

923
01:02:00,657 --> 01:02:02,818
<i>The workingman and the slum child...</i>

924
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:08,024
<i>...know they can expect
my best efforts in their interests.</i>

925
01:02:08,098 --> 01:02:12,694
<i>The decent. Ordinary citizens know
that I'll do everything in my power...</i>

926
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:17,934
<i>...to protect the underprivileged.
The underpaid. And the underfed.</i>

927
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:26,246
- Mother, is Pop governor yet?
- Not yet, Junior.

928
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,487
<i>I'd make my promises now...</i>

929
01:02:33,824 --> 01:02:37,260
<i>...if I weren't too busy
arranging to keep them.</i>

930
01:02:41,865 --> 01:02:44,857
<i>But here's one promise I'll make...</i>

931
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:47,961
<i>...and Boss Jim Gettys knows I'll keep it.</i>

932
01:02:49,272 --> 01:02:52,105
<i>My first official act
as governor of this state...</i>

933
01:02:52,509 --> 01:02:57,378
<i>...will be to appoint a special district
attorney to arrange for the indictment...</i>

934
01:02:57,614 --> 01:03:03,314
<i>...prosecution and conviction
of Boss Jim W. Gettys.</i>

935
01:03:29,546 --> 01:03:32,777
If the election were held today,
you'd be in by 100,000 votes.

936
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:34,680
- Gettys isn't even pretending.
- Pop.

937
01:03:34,785 --> 01:03:36,912
- Hello, son.
- He isn't just scared, he's sick.

938
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:39,854
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys
I mean what I say.

939
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:43,257
- Did you like your old man's speech?
- I could hear every word.

940
01:03:43,326 --> 01:03:44,987
- Hello, Emily.
- Hold it.

941
01:03:45,562 --> 01:03:48,224
- Great speech, Mr. Kane.
- Wonderful.

942
01:03:48,298 --> 01:03:50,630
Will you get us a taxi?

943
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:54,903
I'm sending Junior home
in the car with Oliver.

944
01:03:55,272 --> 01:03:56,933
Good night, Father.

945
01:03:58,241 --> 01:04:00,106
Goodbye, son.

946
01:04:10,821 --> 01:04:14,279
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?

947
01:04:14,357 --> 01:04:16,518
There's a call I want you to make with me.

948
01:04:16,593 --> 01:04:18,527
- It can wait.
- No, it can't.

949
01:04:18,595 --> 01:04:20,290
What's this all about, Emily?

950
01:04:20,363 --> 01:04:23,594
It may not be about anything at all.
I intend to find out.

951
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,761
<i>- Where are you going?
- I'm going to "185 West 74th Street. "</i>

952
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:32,240
If you wish, you may come with me.

953
01:04:36,413 --> 01:04:37,937
I'll come with you.

954
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,578
I had no idea you had this flair
for melodrama, Emily.

955
01:04:48,191 --> 01:04:50,159
Come right in, Mr. Kane.

956
01:05:00,737 --> 01:05:02,102
Charlie.

957
01:05:08,845 --> 01:05:11,905
He forced me to send your wife that letter.
I didn't want to.

958
01:05:11,982 --> 01:05:14,780
He's been saying the most terrible...

959
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:20,750
Mrs. Kane.

960
01:05:22,759 --> 01:05:25,250
I don't suppose
anybody would introduce us.

961
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:28,288
I'm Jim Gettys.

962
01:05:28,899 --> 01:05:30,059
Yes?

963
01:05:33,303 --> 01:05:37,034
I made Miss Alexander send you the note,
Mrs. Kane.

964
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:39,371
She didn't want to at first. But she did it.

965
01:05:39,442 --> 01:05:42,275
Charlie, the things he said to me...
He threatened to...

966
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:47,248
I won't wait until I'm elected.
To start with, I think I'll break your neck.

967
01:05:47,317 --> 01:05:50,081
Maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't.

968
01:05:51,154 --> 01:05:55,284
Your breaking this man's neck
would scarcely explain this note:

969
01:05:56,259 --> 01:06:00,127
<i>"Serious consequences for Mr. Kane,
for yourself and for your son. "</i>

970
01:06:00,197 --> 01:06:03,223
- He wanted to get her to come here...
- What does this note mean?

971
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,860
I'm Susan Alexander.
I know what you're thinking...

972
01:06:05,969 --> 01:06:08,802
- What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander?
- She don't know.

973
01:06:08,872 --> 01:06:11,705
She sent it because I told her
it wouldn't be smart not to.

974
01:06:11,775 --> 01:06:15,074
- Emily, this gentleman...
- I'm not a gentleman.

975
01:06:15,312 --> 01:06:18,179
Your husband is only trying to be funny
calling me one.

976
01:06:18,248 --> 01:06:20,842
I don't even know what a gentleman is.

977
01:06:21,885 --> 01:06:25,116
You see, my idea of a gentleman...

978
01:06:28,325 --> 01:06:31,761
If I owned a paper and didn't like
the way somebody was doing things...

979
01:06:31,828 --> 01:06:34,262
...some politician,
I'd fight him with all I had.

980
01:06:34,331 --> 01:06:36,162
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit...

981
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:38,599
...so his family could see his picture
in the paper.

982
01:06:38,668 --> 01:06:42,604
- You're a cheap, crooked grafter...
- We're talking now about what you are.

983
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:46,373
I'm fighting for my life,
not just my political life.

984
01:06:46,443 --> 01:06:48,638
- He said unless you...
- That's what I said.

985
01:06:48,712 --> 01:06:52,705
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him.
It's more of a chance than he'd give me.

986
01:06:52,782 --> 01:06:57,549
Unless he decides by tomorrow that
he's so sick he has to go away for a year...

987
01:06:57,621 --> 01:07:01,921
...Monday morning, all papers in the state,
except his, will carry the story I'll give.

988
01:07:01,992 --> 01:07:03,391
What story?

989
01:07:04,194 --> 01:07:07,357
- The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
- There isn't any story!

990
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:08,658
Shut up.

991
01:07:09,032 --> 01:07:11,830
We've got evidence that would look bad
in the headlines.

992
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:14,564
Do you want me to give you the evidence?

993
01:07:16,673 --> 01:07:19,506
I'd rather he withdrew
without having the story published.

994
01:07:19,576 --> 01:07:22,636
Not that I care about him,
but I'd be better off that way.

995
01:07:25,582 --> 01:07:27,675
So would you, Mrs. Kane.

996
01:07:28,084 --> 01:07:30,143
What about me?

997
01:07:32,155 --> 01:07:35,989
He said my name would be dragged
through the mud. That everywhere I went...

998
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:38,892
There seems to be only one decision
you can make, Charles.

999
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:41,724
I'd say that it'd been made for you.

1000
01:07:43,366 --> 01:07:45,459
You can't tell me the voters of this state...

1001
01:07:45,702 --> 01:07:48,500
I'm not interested in the voters
of this state right now.

1002
01:07:48,571 --> 01:07:50,038
I am interested in our son.

1003
01:07:50,106 --> 01:07:53,269
- Charlie, if they publish this story...
- They won't.

1004
01:07:54,544 --> 01:07:56,705
Good night, Mr. Gettys.

1005
01:08:05,622 --> 01:08:07,715
Are you coming, Charles?

1006
01:08:09,926 --> 01:08:11,291
No.

1007
01:08:14,698 --> 01:08:16,325
I'm staying here.

1008
01:08:19,469 --> 01:08:21,562
I can fight this all alone.

1009
01:08:22,806 --> 01:08:25,297
If you don't listen to reason,
it may be too late.

1010
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:29,334
Too late? For what?

1011
01:08:31,448 --> 01:08:34,713
For you and this public thief...

1012
01:08:35,051 --> 01:08:37,383
...to take the love of the people
away from me?

1013
01:08:37,454 --> 01:08:40,218
You got other things to think about.
Your little boy.

1014
01:08:40,357 --> 01:08:42,825
You don't want him to read about you
in the papers.

1015
01:08:42,892 --> 01:08:47,420
There's only one person in the world
to decide what I'll do. And that's me.

1016
01:08:50,266 --> 01:08:53,827
You decided what you were going to do,
Charles, some time ago.

1017
01:09:01,077 --> 01:09:03,739
You're making a bigger fool of yourself
than I thought.

1018
01:09:03,813 --> 01:09:06,179
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- You're licked...

1019
01:09:06,249 --> 01:09:09,650
Get out. If you want to see me,
have the warden write me a letter.

1020
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:14,550
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going
to happen to you would be a lesson to you.

1021
01:09:14,824 --> 01:09:17,520
Only you're going to need
more than one lesson.

1022
01:09:18,361 --> 01:09:22,388
- And you'll get more than one lesson.
- Don't worry about me, Gettys.

1023
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:26,127
Don't worry about me!

1024
01:09:27,003 --> 01:09:29,631
I'm Charles Foster Kane!

1025
01:09:30,206 --> 01:09:34,472
I'm no cheap, crooked politician
trying to save himself...

1026
01:09:34,544 --> 01:09:37,570
...from the consequences of his crimes!

1027
01:09:38,615 --> 01:09:42,642
Gettys! I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.

1028
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:44,912
Sing Sing, Gettys.

1029
01:09:48,191 --> 01:09:51,251
- Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
- Yes, thank you.

1030
01:09:51,795 --> 01:09:54,559
- Good night.
- Good night.

1031
01:10:05,341 --> 01:10:09,334
<i>Paper. Read all about it. Extra. Extra.</i>

1032
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,909
- Paper?
- No, thanks.

1033
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:33,667
With a million majority
already against him...

1034
01:10:33,903 --> 01:10:37,270
...and the church counties
still to be heard from...

1035
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:39,908
...I'm afraid we got no choice.

1036
01:10:39,943 --> 01:10:41,410
This one?

1037
01:10:44,848 --> 01:10:46,611
That one.

1038
01:11:09,906 --> 01:11:11,771
Good night again.

1039
01:11:22,919 --> 01:11:26,411
- Is there anything I can...
- No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.

1040
01:11:28,024 --> 01:11:30,356
You better go home and get some sleep.

1041
01:11:31,427 --> 01:11:32,917
You, too.

1042
01:11:35,331 --> 01:11:37,094
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1043
01:12:02,258 --> 01:12:04,818
- Hello, Jedediah.
- I'm drunk.

1044
01:12:08,464 --> 01:12:13,629
If you've got drunk to talk to me about...

1045
01:12:16,105 --> 01:12:18,699
...Ms. Alexander, don't bother.

1046
01:12:20,543 --> 01:12:22,340
I'm not interested.

1047
01:12:26,549 --> 01:12:30,417
I've set back the sacred cause of reform,
is that it?

1048
01:12:31,888 --> 01:12:33,287
All right.

1049
01:12:35,024 --> 01:12:38,357
If that's the way they want it,
the people have made their choice.

1050
01:12:38,428 --> 01:12:41,192
It's obvious the people prefer
Jim Gettys to me.

1051
01:12:41,297 --> 01:12:44,960
You talk about the people
as though you owned them.

1052
01:12:45,034 --> 01:12:47,366
As though they belong to you. Goodness.

1053
01:12:48,071 --> 01:12:52,906
As long as I can remember, you've talked
about giving the people their rights...

1054
01:12:53,042 --> 01:12:56,273
...as if you could make them
a present of liberty...

1055
01:12:56,446 --> 01:12:58,937
...as a reward for services rendered.

1056
01:12:59,015 --> 01:13:01,449
- Jed.
- You remember the workingman?

1057
01:13:02,185 --> 01:13:04,847
I'll get drunk, too, Jedediah...

1058
01:13:06,322 --> 01:13:07,584
...if it'll do any good.

1059
01:13:07,657 --> 01:13:11,058
It won't do any good.
Besides you never get drunk.

1060
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,993
You used to write an awful lot
about the workingman...

1061
01:13:14,063 --> 01:13:14,961
Go on home.

1062
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:17,898
<i>He's turning into something called
"organized labor. "</i>

1063
01:13:19,702 --> 01:13:23,035
You won't like that one little bit
when you find out...

1064
01:13:23,106 --> 01:13:28,237
...it means your workingman expects
something as his right, and not your gift.

1065
01:13:30,346 --> 01:13:34,840
When your precious underprivileged
really get together...

1066
01:13:35,451 --> 01:13:37,248
Oh, boy...

1067
01:13:38,021 --> 01:13:41,013
That'll add up to something
bigger than your privilege...

1068
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:44,025
...then I don't know what you'll do.

1069
01:13:44,093 --> 01:13:49,429
Sail away to a desert island probably
and lord it over the monkeys.

1070
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,861
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

1071
01:13:53,202 --> 01:13:58,105
There'll probably be a few of them there
to tell me when I do something wrong.

1072
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:00,435
You may not always be so lucky.

1073
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:02,700
You're not very drunk.

1074
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:04,804
Drunk, what do you care?

1075
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:08,082
You don't care about anything except you.

1076
01:14:09,052 --> 01:14:14,922
You persuade people that you love them
so much that they ought to love you back.

1077
01:14:15,258 --> 01:14:17,886
Only you want love on your own terms.

1078
01:14:19,629 --> 01:14:23,030
It's something to be played your way,
according to your rules.

1079
01:14:29,706 --> 01:14:32,903
- Let me work on the Chicago paper.
- What?

1080
01:14:33,176 --> 01:14:37,977
<i>You said you were looking for someone
to do dramatic "crimitism," criticism.</i>

1081
01:14:38,214 --> 01:14:39,943
I am drunk.

1082
01:14:42,518 --> 01:14:44,509
I want to go to Chicago.

1083
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:47,551
You're too valuable here.

1084
01:14:49,792 --> 01:14:53,785
- There's nothing left for me to do...
- All right, you can go to Chicago.

1085
01:14:53,863 --> 01:14:55,057
Thank you.

1086
01:14:56,165 --> 01:14:58,725
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.

1087
01:15:00,436 --> 01:15:02,904
I warn you, Jedediah,
you won't like Chicago.

1088
01:15:02,972 --> 01:15:07,636
The wind comes off the lake, and they've
probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.

1089
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:09,905
Will Saturday after next be all right?

1090
01:15:09,946 --> 01:15:11,937
- Anytime you say.
- Thank you.

1091
01:15:17,653 --> 01:15:22,647
A toast to love on my terms.
Those are the only terms anybody knows:

1092
01:15:24,227 --> 01:15:25,421
His own.

1093
01:15:38,374 --> 01:15:40,899
<i>Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.</i>

1094
01:15:50,186 --> 01:15:53,087
- What's that, young man?
- Are you through with politics?

1095
01:15:53,156 --> 01:15:55,920
Am I through with politics?
I would say vice versa.

1096
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,955
We're going to be an opera star.

1097
01:15:59,028 --> 01:16:00,893
Are you singing at the Metropolitan?

1098
01:16:00,963 --> 01:16:02,328
We certainly are.

1099
01:16:02,565 --> 01:16:05,398
Charlie said if I didn't,
he'd build me an opera house.

1100
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:06,968
That won't be necessary.

1101
01:16:11,874 --> 01:16:15,139
No, no, no!

1102
01:16:48,778 --> 01:16:50,245
Places, please!

1103
01:17:39,328 --> 01:17:42,126
Mr. Leland is writing it
from the dramatic angle?

1104
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:45,690
- And we've covered it from the news end.
- And the social.

1105
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:48,766
How about the music notice?

1106
01:17:48,838 --> 01:17:50,806
Yes, it's already made up.

1107
01:17:50,907 --> 01:17:53,535
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.

1108
01:17:55,077 --> 01:17:59,241
- Enthusiastic?
- Yes, sir.

1109
01:17:59,382 --> 01:18:02,010
Mr. Kane. This is a surprise.

1110
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,588
We've got two spreads of pictures.

1111
01:18:06,689 --> 01:18:08,520
The music notice on the front page?

1112
01:18:08,624 --> 01:18:12,253
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic.

1113
01:18:13,396 --> 01:18:14,920
The dramatic notice.

1114
01:18:16,098 --> 01:18:20,694
- Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it?
- Yes, we're waiting for it.

1115
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:27,600
- Where is he?
- Right in there, Mr. Kane.

1116
01:18:35,518 --> 01:18:36,985
Mr. Kane.

1117
01:18:51,834 --> 01:18:54,462
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane...

1118
01:18:55,605 --> 01:18:58,904
...haven't spoken together for years.

1119
01:19:01,477 --> 01:19:04,139
- You don't suppose...
- There's nothing to suppose.

1120
01:19:08,551 --> 01:19:09,848
Excuse me.

1121
01:19:26,902 --> 01:19:28,392
Close the door.

1122
01:19:31,741 --> 01:19:34,266
He ain't been drinking before.

1123
01:19:35,144 --> 01:19:37,237
Never. We would have heard.

1124
01:19:37,546 --> 01:19:39,537
What does it say there?

1125
01:19:40,016 --> 01:19:42,678
The notice, what's he written?

1126
01:19:44,387 --> 01:19:49,381
<i>"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty
but hopelessly incompetent amateur...</i>

1127
01:19:52,895 --> 01:19:56,797
<i>"... last night opened
the new Chicago Opera House...</i>

1128
01:19:57,099 --> 01:19:58,862
<i>"... in a performance of... "</i>

1129
01:20:01,937 --> 01:20:05,464
I still can't pronounce that name.

1130
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:12,937
<i>"Her singing, happily,
is no concern of this department.</i>

1131
01:20:13,349 --> 01:20:17,251
<i>"Of her acting,
it is absolutely impossible to... "</i>

1132
01:20:18,988 --> 01:20:20,148
Go on.

1133
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:24,593
That's all there is.

1134
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:41,268
Of her acting it is absolutely
impossible to say anything except...

1135
01:20:41,343 --> 01:20:44,938
...that, in the opinion of this reviewer,
it represents a new low.

1136
01:20:45,147 --> 01:20:48,048
- In the opinion of this reviewer.
- I didn't see that.

1137
01:20:48,117 --> 01:20:50,483
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein, I'm dictating it.

1138
01:20:50,553 --> 01:20:53,488
- Mr. Kane, I...
- Get me a typewriter.

1139
01:20:54,924 --> 01:20:57,324
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.

1140
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:16,310
Hello, Bernstein.

1141
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:24,817
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Leland.

1142
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:31,321
Where's my notice, Bernstein?
I've got to finish my notice.

1143
01:21:31,393 --> 01:21:34,658
- Mr. Kane is finishing it for you.
- Charlie?

1144
01:21:40,636 --> 01:21:42,968
Charlie out there?

1145
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:47,174
I guess he's fixing it up.

1146
01:21:49,612 --> 01:21:52,012
I knew I'd never get that through.

1147
01:21:52,882 --> 01:21:56,909
Mr. Kane's finishing your review
just the way you started it.

1148
01:21:57,286 --> 01:22:00,983
He's writing a bad notice
like you wanted it to be.

1149
01:22:03,492 --> 01:22:05,517
I guess that'll show you.

1150
01:22:30,419 --> 01:22:32,319
Hello, Jedediah.

1151
01:22:35,591 --> 01:22:37,024
Hello, Charlie.

1152
01:22:38,627 --> 01:22:41,494
I didn't know we were speaking.

1153
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:44,061
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.

1154
01:22:46,135 --> 01:22:48,296
You're fired.

1155
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:05,145
<i>Everybody knows that story. Mr. Leland.
But why did he do it?</i>

1156
01:23:06,622 --> 01:23:09,819
- How could a man write a notice...
- You just don't know Charlie.

1157
01:23:09,892 --> 01:23:13,828
He thought that by finishing that notice
he'd show me he was an honest man.

1158
01:23:13,896 --> 01:23:16,160
He was always trying to prove something.

1159
01:23:16,232 --> 01:23:19,360
That whole thing about Susie
being an opera singer.

1160
01:23:19,435 --> 01:23:21,699
That was trying to prove something.

1161
01:23:22,471 --> 01:23:25,838
You know what the headline was
the day before the election?

1162
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:32,204
<i>"Candidate Kane found
in love nest with 'singer. "'</i>

1163
01:23:32,281 --> 01:23:34,408
He was going to take
the quotes off the singer.

1164
01:23:34,483 --> 01:23:35,609
Hey, nurse!

1165
01:23:35,718 --> 01:23:39,711
Five years ago he wrote
from that place down there in the South.

1166
01:23:39,788 --> 01:23:47,456
What's it called, Shangri-la? El Dorado?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?

1167
01:23:48,697 --> 01:23:53,031
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.

1168
01:23:53,102 --> 01:23:57,232
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.

1169
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,040
Well, I never even answered his letter.

1170
01:24:00,809 --> 01:24:02,208
Maybe I should have.

1171
01:24:02,278 --> 01:24:06,339
I guess he was pretty lonely down there
in that coliseum all those years.

1172
01:24:06,782 --> 01:24:09,876
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.

1173
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:13,184
He never finished anything
except my notice.

1174
01:24:13,555 --> 01:24:16,718
- Of course, he built the joint for her.
- That must have been love.

1175
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:17,759
I don't know.

1176
01:24:17,993 --> 01:24:22,521
He was disappointed in the world
so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.

1177
01:24:23,232 --> 01:24:25,792
It was something bigger
than an opera house anyway.

1178
01:24:25,868 --> 01:24:27,267
- Nurse.
- Yes, Mr. Leland.

1179
01:24:27,336 --> 01:24:28,701
I'm coming.

1180
01:24:30,272 --> 01:24:33,764
- There's one thing you can do for me.
- Sure.

1181
01:24:33,876 --> 01:24:38,540
Stop at the cigar store on your way out,
and get me a couple of good cigars.

1182
01:24:38,614 --> 01:24:40,707
- Be glad to.
- Thank you.

1183
01:24:41,183 --> 01:24:42,616
One is enough.

1184
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:47,389
When I was a young man, there was
an impression that nurses were pretty.

1185
01:24:47,456 --> 01:24:49,549
Well, it was no truer then than it is today.

1186
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:51,752
- I'll take your arm.
- All right.

1187
01:24:51,827 --> 01:24:54,557
- You won't forget about those cigars?
- I won't.

1188
01:24:54,763 --> 01:24:59,700
Have them wrapped like toothpaste,
or they'll stop them at the desk.

1189
01:24:59,768 --> 01:25:02,669
You know that young doctor
I was telling you about, well...

1190
01:25:02,738 --> 01:25:06,640
...he's got an idea
he wants to keep me alive.

1191
01:25:35,904 --> 01:25:39,897
I'd rather you'd just talk.
Anything that comes into your mind...

1192
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:42,837
...about yourself and Mr. Kane.

1193
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:48,382
You don't want to hear what comes into
my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.

1194
01:25:49,918 --> 01:25:54,719
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung
for Charlie that first time I met him.

1195
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:58,893
But I did an awful lot of singing after that.

1196
01:26:00,763 --> 01:26:04,631
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.

1197
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,294
- The teachers got that, I didn't.
- What did you get?

1198
01:26:07,369 --> 01:26:10,896
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons.
That's all there was in it.

1199
01:26:10,973 --> 01:26:12,463
He married you, didn't he?

1200
01:26:12,541 --> 01:26:15,977
He didn't mention anything about marriage
until after it was over and...

1201
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:18,411
...until it got in the papers about us...

1202
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:23,383
...and he lost the election,
and that Norton woman divorced him.

1203
01:26:23,719 --> 01:26:25,744
He was really interested in my voice.

1204
01:26:25,821 --> 01:26:27,413
Why did he build that opera house?

1205
01:26:27,489 --> 01:26:31,323
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing.
It was his idea.

1206
01:26:32,728 --> 01:26:34,787
Everything was his idea...

1207
01:26:37,766 --> 01:26:39,757
...except my leaving him.

1208
01:26:47,743 --> 01:26:52,407
<i>"Don't forget"</i>

1209
01:26:52,481 --> 01:26:53,971
Don't get nervous.

1210
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:56,779
Please. Let's come back.

1211
01:26:58,353 --> 01:27:01,584
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.

1212
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:10,621
<i>"Get the voice out of the throat

1213

1214
01:27:25,681 --> 01:27:27,945
You're out of pitch.

1215
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,814
Some people can sing. Some can't.

1216
01:27:34,957 --> 01:27:36,515
Impossible.

1217
01:27:37,459 --> 01:27:40,519
It's not your job to give your opinion
of Mrs. Kane's talents.

1218
01:27:42,464 --> 01:27:46,025
<i>You're supposed to train her voice,
Signor Matiste. Nothing more.</i>

1219
01:27:46,768 --> 01:27:48,531
Please continue with the lesson.

1220
01:27:48,604 --> 01:27:51,004
- But, Mr. Kane.
- Please.

1221
01:27:52,007 --> 01:27:55,909
I'll be the laughingstock
of the musical world. People will think...

1222
01:27:55,944 --> 01:27:58,913
You're concerned what people will think?

1223
01:27:58,947 --> 01:28:03,543
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit.
I'm an authority on what people will think.

1224
01:28:04,253 --> 01:28:06,016
The newspapers for example.

1225
01:28:06,321 --> 01:28:09,017
I run several newspapers
between here and San Francisco.

1226
01:28:09,091 --> 01:28:10,558
It's all right, darling.

1227
01:28:10,792 --> 01:28:12,987
<i>Signor Matiste is going to listen to reason.</i>

1228
01:28:13,896 --> 01:28:16,694
- How can I persuade you...
- You can't.

1229
01:28:42,891 --> 01:28:45,018
It's all right, darling, go ahead.

1230
01:28:56,838 --> 01:28:59,568
I thought you'd see it my way.

1231
01:29:09,851 --> 01:29:13,753
No, no, no.

A friend don't write that kind of review.

1256
01:32:45,867 --> 01:32:49,268
All these other papers panning me,
I could expect that.

1257

<i>But for the Inquirer to run a thing like that,
spoiling my whole debut.</i>

1258

01:32:54,042 --> 01:32:54,974
I'll get it.

1260
01:32:55,076 --> 01:32:57,909
Friend. Not the kind of friends I know...

1261
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:00,205
...but I'm not high class like you.

1262
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:02,542
And I never went to any swell schools.

1263
01:33:02,617 --> 01:33:04,016
That'll be enough, Susan.

1264
01:33:04,085 --> 01:33:05,347
From Mr. Leland, sir.

1265
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:08,981
He wanted me to make sure
you got this personally.

1266
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:11,919
Is that something from him?

1267
01:33:13,395 --> 01:33:14,623
Charlie!

1268
01:33:15,397 --> 01:33:19,231
As for you,
you ought to have your head examined.

1269
01:33:19,434 --> 01:33:21,994
Sending him a letter telling him he's fired...

1270
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:24,595
...with a $25,000 check in it.

1271
01:33:24,673 --> 01:33:27,164
What kind of firing do you call that?

1272
01:33:27,876 --> 01:33:32,108
You did send him a check for $25,000,
didn't you?

1273
01:33:33,415 --> 01:33:34,404
Yes.

1274
01:33:36,918 --> 01:33:40,115
I sent him a check for $25,000.

1275
01:33:42,757 --> 01:33:44,190
What's that?

01:33:45,427 --> 01:33:46,917
Declaration of Principles.

1277
01:33:46,995 --> 01:33:48,087
What?

1278
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:49,888
What is it?

1279
01:33:55,737 --> 01:33:56,761
An antique.

1280
01:33:56,838 --> 01:33:59,602
You're awful funny, aren't you?

1281
01:34:00,675 --> 01:34:04,941
I'll tell you one thing you're not going
to be funny about, and that's my singing.

1282
01:34:05,013 --> 01:34:06,139
I'm through.

1283
01:34:06,214 --> 01:34:08,774
I never wanted to do it in the first place.

1284
01:34:09,284 --> 01:34:11,775
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.

1285
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,753
I don't propose
to have myself made ridiculous.

1286
01:34:14,823 --> 01:34:18,054
You don't propose
to have yourself made ridiculous!

1287
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:21,492
What about me?
I'm the one that has to sing.

1288
01:34:21,596 --> 01:34:23,530
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.

1289
01:34:23,632 --> 01:34:25,463
Why don't you leave me alone?

1290
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:27,263
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.

1291
01:34:27,335 --> 01:34:29,462
You seem unable to understand them.

1292
01:34:30,338 --> 01:34:32,568
I will not tell them to you again.

1293
01:34:36,244 --> 01:34:38,439
You'll continue with your singing.

1294
01:36:10,905 --> 01:36:12,770
Get Dr. Corey.

1295
01:36:17,145 --> 01:36:18,237
Susan.

1296
01:36:19,114 --> 01:36:22,777
She'll be perfectly all right
in a day or two, Mr. Kane.

1297
01:36:24,753 --> 01:36:28,814
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane
came to make such a foolish mistake.

1298
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:33,886
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her
was in a somewhat larger bottle.

1299
01:36:34,262 --> 01:36:38,756
The strain of preparing for the new opera
has excited and confused her.

1300
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:41,028
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

1301
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:44,600
No objections to my staying
with her are there?

1302
01:36:44,806 --> 01:36:48,867
No, not at all.
I'd like the nurse to be here, too.

1303
01:36:49,644 --> 01:36:51,805
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1304
01:37:27,282 --> 01:37:28,909
Charlie.

1305
01:37:31,619 --> 01:37:34,315
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.

1306
01:37:36,257 --> 01:37:39,021
But I couldn't go through
with the singing again.

1307
01:37:40,929 --> 01:37:44,160
You don't know what it means
to know that people...

1308
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:48,465
That the whole audience doesn't want you.

1309
01:37:52,073 --> 01:37:54,166
That's when you got to fight them.

1310
01:38:02,584 --> 01:38:04,142
All right.

1311
01:38:06,087 --> 01:38:08,487
You won't have to fight them anymore.

1312
01:38:11,826 --> 01:38:13,919
It's their loss.

1313
01:38:29,577 --> 01:38:31,340
What are you doing?

1314
01:38:35,784 --> 01:38:37,775
Jigsaw puzzles?

1315
01:38:42,924 --> 01:38:44,915
Charlie, what time is it?

1316
01:38:45,493 --> 01:38:46,983
11:30.

1317
01:38:47,162 --> 01:38:48,595
In New York?

1318
01:38:51,499 --> 01:38:54,332
I said what time is it in New York?

1319
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:58,298
- 11:30.
- Night?

1320
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:03,741
<i>The Bulldog's just gone to press.</i>

1321
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:07,009
<i>Well, hurray for the Bulldog.</i>

1322
01:39:08,883 --> 01:39:12,649
Gee, 11:30. Shows are just getting up.

1323
01:39:12,787 --> 01:39:15,517
People are going to nightclubs
and restaurants.

1324
01:39:16,191 --> 01:39:19,627
Of course, we're different
because we live in a palace.

1325
01:39:19,694 --> 01:39:22,322
You always said you wanted
to live in a palace.

1326
01:39:22,397 --> 01:39:24,763
A person could go crazy in this dump.

1327
01:39:24,966 --> 01:39:28,800
Nobody to talk to,
nobody to have any fun with.

1328
01:39:29,537 --> 01:39:33,405
49,000 acres of nothing
but scenery and statues.

1329
01:39:33,641 --> 01:39:35,108
I'm lonesome.

1330
01:39:35,176 --> 01:39:39,112
Until yesterday, we've had no less
than 50 of your friends at any one time.

1331
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,876
I think if you look in the west wing...

1332
01:39:41,983 --> 01:39:45,077
...you'll probably find a dozen vacationists
still in residence.

1333
01:39:45,153 --> 01:39:47,747
You make a joke out of everything.

1334
01:39:48,256 --> 01:39:52,886
Charlie, I want to go to New York.
I'm tired of being a hostess.

1335
01:39:52,961 --> 01:39:56,829
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.

1336
01:39:58,533 --> 01:40:01,366
Charlie, please.

1337
01:40:02,303 --> 01:40:04,965
Our home is here, Susan.

1338
01:40:10,712 --> 01:40:12,907
I don't care to visit New York.

1339
01:40:49,884 --> 01:40:51,647
What are you doing?

1340
01:40:54,622 --> 01:40:57,887
One thing I can never understand:

1341
01:40:57,992 --> 01:41:00,187
How do you know
you haven't done it before?

1342
01:41:00,261 --> 01:41:04,254
It makes a whole lot more sense
than collecting statues.

1343
01:41:05,867 --> 01:41:07,459
You may be right.

1344
01:41:07,869 --> 01:41:09,928
I sometimes wonder...

1345
01:41:10,338 --> 01:41:12,772
...but you get into the habit.

1346
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:15,741
It's not a habit, I do it because I like it.

1347
01:41:16,144 --> 01:41:18,738
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1348
01:41:21,115 --> 01:41:24,141
Invite everybody to spend the night
at the Everglades.

1349
01:41:24,385 --> 01:41:28,788
Invite everybody. Order everybody,
you mean, and make them sleep in tents.

1350
01:41:28,856 --> 01:41:31,848
Who wants to sleep in tents
when they've got their own room...

1351
01:41:31,893 --> 01:41:34,555
...with a bath, where they know
where everything is?

1352
01:41:34,629 --> 01:41:38,030
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1353
01:41:41,369 --> 01:41:45,703
You never give me anything
I really care about.

1354
01:41:54,248 --> 01:41:56,148
<i>"It can't be love</i>

1355
01:41:58,653 --> 01:42:03,283
<i>"For there is no true love</i>

1356
01:42:03,658 --> 01:42:06,149
<i>"I know I've played at the game</i>

1357
01:42:06,227 --> 01:42:09,094
<i>"Like a moth in a blue flame</i>

1358
01:42:09,163 --> 01:42:12,963
<i>"Lost in the end, just the same</i>

1359
01:42:13,067 --> 01:42:15,592
<i>"All these years</i>

1360
01:42:15,737 --> 01:42:20,640
<i>"My heart's been floating around
in a puddle of tears</i>

1361
01:42:23,011 --> 01:42:24,979
<i>"I wonder what it is"</i>

1362
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:29,140
Sure, you give me things,
but that don't mean anything to you.

1363
01:42:31,552 --> 01:42:34,646
You're in a tent, darling,
you're not at home.

1364
01:42:34,722 --> 01:42:38,089
I can hear you very well
if you speak in a normal tone of voice.

1365
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:42,095
What's the difference between giving me
a bracelet or giving someone $100,000...

1366
01:42:42,163 --> 01:42:45,189
...for a statue you'll keep crated up
and never look at?

1367
01:42:45,266 --> 01:42:47,666
It's just money. It doesn't mean anything.

1368
01:42:47,735 --> 01:42:50,932
You never really gave me anything
that you care about.

1369
01:42:51,005 --> 01:42:52,836
I want you to stop this.

1370
01:42:52,907 --> 01:42:54,340
I'm not going to stop it.

1371
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:56,707
You never gave me anything in your life.

1372
01:42:56,778 --> 01:43:00,043
You just tried to buy me
into giving you something.

1373
01:43:02,817 --> 01:43:06,753
<i>"It can't be love"</i>

1374
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,194
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.

1375
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:24,238
You don't love me.

1376
01:43:24,338 --> 01:43:26,306
You want me to love you.

1377
01:43:26,374 --> 01:43:29,309
<i>Sure. "I'm Charles Foster Kane.</i>

1378
01:43:29,377 --> 01:43:31,971
<i>"Whatever you want,
just name it and it's yours.</i>

1379
01:43:32,046 --> 01:43:34,310
<i>"But you gotta love me. "</i>

1380
01:43:38,786 --> 01:43:41,516
Don't tell me you're sorry.

1381
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:45,221
I'm not sorry.

1382
01:43:57,004 --> 01:43:58,631
Mr. Kane?

1383
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,804
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.

1384
01:44:04,679 --> 01:44:07,842
Marie has been packing for her
since morning.

1385
01:44:13,921 --> 01:44:17,652
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.
Tell him he can get the bags.

1386
01:44:18,192 --> 01:44:19,454
Yes, madame.

1387
01:44:21,462 --> 01:44:23,828
Have you gone completely crazy?

1388
01:44:23,898 --> 01:44:27,129
Don't you know that our guests,
that everyone will know about this?

1389
01:44:27,235 --> 01:44:29,066
Packed your bag, sent for the car...

1390
01:44:29,137 --> 01:44:30,229
And left you?

1391
01:44:30,505 --> 01:44:32,439
Of course they'll hear.

1392
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:36,069
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.

1393
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:39,108
But I never imagined
people wouldn't know.

1394
01:44:41,582 --> 01:44:43,482
I won't let you go.

1395
01:44:50,825 --> 01:44:52,452
Goodbye, Charlie.

1396
01:44:55,997 --> 01:44:57,464
Susan.

1397
01:45:07,608 --> 01:45:09,200
Please don't go.

1398
01:45:14,882 --> 01:45:16,679
Please, Susan.

1399
01:45:19,887 --> 01:45:23,345
From now on, everything will be
exactly the way you want it to be.

1400
01:45:23,424 --> 01:45:25,551
Not the way I think you want it, but...

1401
01:45:27,195 --> 01:45:28,719
...your way.

1402
01:45:35,203 --> 01:45:36,568
You mustn't go.

1403
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,933
You can't do this to me.

1404
01:45:43,678 --> 01:45:45,339
I see.

1405
01:45:46,214 --> 01:45:48,808
It's you that this is being done to.

1406
01:45:49,083 --> 01:45:50,914
It's not me at all.

1407
01:45:51,152 --> 01:45:53,052
Not what it means to me.

1408
01:45:55,223 --> 01:45:57,418
I can't do this to you?

1409
01:45:58,893 --> 01:46:00,827
Oh, yes, I can.

1410
01:46:19,947 --> 01:46:23,075
In case you haven't heard,
I lost all my money and it was plenty.

1411
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:25,516
The last 10 years
have been difficult for many.

1412
01:46:25,586 --> 01:46:28,555
They haven't been tough on me.
I just lost all my money.

1413
01:46:29,123 --> 01:46:32,286
- You're going down to Xanadu?
- Monday, with boys from the office.

1414
01:46:32,393 --> 01:46:35,123
Mr. Rawlston wants
the whole place photographed.

1415
01:46:35,196 --> 01:46:36,823
We run a picture magazine.

1416
01:46:36,897 --> 01:46:40,628
If you're smart, you'll get in touch
with Raymond. He's the butler.

1417
01:46:40,701 --> 01:46:42,692
You'll learn a lot from him.

1418
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:45,238
He knows where all the bodies are buried.

1419
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:48,636
You know, all the same,
I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.

1420
01:46:50,878 --> 01:46:52,573
Don't you think I do?

1421
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:00,087
What do you know, it's morning already.

1422
01:47:03,591 --> 01:47:07,152
Come around and tell me the story
of your life sometime.

1423
01:47:14,168 --> 01:47:15,795
Rosebud?

1424
01:47:18,439 --> 01:47:20,498
I'll tell you about Rosebud.

1425
01:47:20,975 --> 01:47:22,909
How much is it worth to you?

1426
01:47:23,511 --> 01:47:25,274
$1,000?

1427
01:47:34,588 --> 01:47:37,284
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.

1428
01:47:37,992 --> 01:47:41,450
- He acted funny sometimes, you know?
- No, I didn't.

1429
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:44,096
Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.

1430
01:47:44,432 --> 01:47:46,866
I've been working for him 11 years now...

1431
01:47:46,901 --> 01:47:50,769
...in charge of the whole place,
so I ought to know.

1432
01:47:51,105 --> 01:47:52,367
- Rosebud.
- Yes.

1433
01:47:52,473 --> 01:47:57,467
Like I tell you, the old man
acted kind of funny sometimes...

1434
01:47:57,545 --> 01:48:01,242
...but I knew how to handle him...
- Need a lot of service?

1435
01:48:01,315 --> 01:48:04,341
But I knew how to handle him.

1436
01:48:04,518 --> 01:48:06,179
Like that time his wife left.

1437
01:50:21,922 --> 01:50:23,150
Rosebud.

1438
01:51:31,225 --> 01:51:32,783
I see.

1439
01:51:33,427 --> 01:51:35,895
And that's what you know about Rosebud?

1440
01:51:37,431 --> 01:51:39,865
I heard him say it that other time, too.

1441
01:51:40,467 --> 01:51:42,401
He just said:

1442
01:51:42,803 --> 01:51:44,600
<i>"Rosebud. "</i>

1443
01:51:44,705 --> 01:51:47,970
Then he dropped the glass ball
and it broke on the floor.

1444
01:51:48,676 --> 01:51:52,908
He didn't say anything after that,
and I knew he was dead.

1445
01:51:53,647 --> 01:51:56,343
He said all kinds of things
that didn't mean anything.

1446
01:51:56,417 --> 01:51:58,408
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1447
01:51:59,486 --> 01:52:02,182
- Yes and no.
- That isn't worth $1,000.

1448
01:52:02,256 --> 01:52:05,248
You can keep on asking questions
if you want to.

1449
01:52:05,492 --> 01:52:07,187
We're leaving tonight...

1450
01:52:07,962 --> 01:52:09,930
...when we're through taking pictures.

1451
01:52:09,997 --> 01:52:11,965
Allow yourself plenty of time.

1452
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:15,900
The train stops at the junction on signal,
but they don't like to wait.

1453
01:52:16,937 --> 01:52:19,906
I can remember when they'd wait all day...

1454
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,935
...if Mr. Kane said so.

1455
01:52:23,344 --> 01:52:25,938
Better get going.

1456
01:52:28,949 --> 01:52:32,885
- Can we come down?
- Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.

1457
01:52:35,089 --> 01:52:38,525
How much do you think
this is all worth, Mr. Thompson?

1458
01:52:38,792 --> 01:52:40,282
Millions.

1459
01:52:41,795 --> 01:52:42,955
If anybody wants it.

1460
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:45,760
Well, at least he brought all this stuff
to America.

1461
01:52:45,833 --> 01:52:47,562
- What's that?
- Another Venus.

1462
01:52:47,635 --> 01:52:48,966
$25,000.

1463
01:52:49,036 --> 01:52:51,630
A lot of money to pay
for a dame without a head.

1464
01:52:51,739 --> 01:52:53,900
The banks are out of luck?

1465
01:52:55,409 --> 01:52:58,139
- They'll clear all right.
- He never threw anything away.

1466
01:52:58,212 --> 01:53:03,411
<i>"Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467
employees of the New York Inquirer. "</i>

1467
01:53:03,484 --> 01:53:08,888
<i>"One stove from the estate of Mary Kane,
Little Salem, Colorado. Value: $2."</i>

1468
01:53:08,922 --> 01:53:11,413
We're supposed to get everything,
junk as well as art.

1469
01:53:11,492 --> 01:53:13,187
He sure liked to collect things.

1470
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:14,659
Anything and everything.

1471
01:53:14,795 --> 01:53:16,456
A regular crow, eh?

1472
01:53:16,530 --> 01:53:19,260
- Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle.
- We got a lot of those.

1473
01:53:19,333 --> 01:53:22,359
A Burmese temple and three
Spanish ceilings down the hall.

1474
01:53:22,903 --> 01:53:24,336
Part of a Scotch castle...

1475
01:53:24,405 --> 01:53:26,236
...that needs to be unwrapped.

1476
01:53:26,573 --> 01:53:28,063
Put all this stuff together:

1477
01:53:28,142 --> 01:53:31,270
The palaces and the paintings,
and the toys and everything.

1478
01:53:31,345 --> 01:53:33,336
What would it spell?

1479
01:53:34,815 --> 01:53:37,545
- Charles Foster Kane?
- Or Rosebud.

1480
01:53:37,851 --> 01:53:41,082
- How about it, Jerry?
- What's Rosebud?

1481
01:53:41,155 --> 01:53:43,385
That's what he said when he died.

1482
01:53:44,058 --> 01:53:46,219
Did you ever find out what it means?

1483
01:53:46,293 --> 01:53:48,523
- No, I didn't.
- What did you find out about him?

1484
01:53:48,595 --> 01:53:50,085
Not much, really.

1485
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:54,895
We'd better get started.

1486
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:59,236
What have you been doing all this time?

1487
01:54:00,307 --> 01:54:01,899
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.

1488
01:54:01,975 --> 01:54:05,741
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant,
I bet it would've explained everything.

1489
01:54:05,846 --> 01:54:07,370
No, I don't think so.

1490
01:54:08,015 --> 01:54:09,414
No.

1491
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:13,111
He was a man who got
everything he wanted, and then lost it.

1492
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:16,917
Maybe Rosebud was something
he couldn't get or something he lost.

1493
01:54:16,990 --> 01:54:19,288
It wouldn't have explained anything.

1494
01:54:20,127 --> 01:54:23,255
I don't think any word
can explain a man's life.

1495
01:54:24,231 --> 01:54:28,429
No. I guess Rosebud is just a piece
in a jigsaw puzzle.

1496
01:54:29,603 --> 01:54:31,332
A missing piece.

1497
01:54:37,144 --> 01:54:39,339
Come on, everybody...

1498
01:54:41,148 --> 01:54:43,412
...we'll miss the train.

1499
01:55:48,115 --> 01:55:50,345
Throw that junk in.

1500
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:30,939
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

1501
01:57:31,618 --> 01:57:33,609
Everything was his idea...

1502
01:57:35,589 --> 01:57:37,580
...except my leaving him.

1503
01:57:38,492 --> 01:57:40,483
I've got his trunk all packed.

1504
01:57:41,795 --> 01:57:43,922
I've had it packed for a week now.

1505
01:57:44,197 --> 01:57:47,689
Sometimes I think I'd prefer
a rival of flesh and blood.

1506
01:57:49,403 --> 01:57:51,894
You're gonna need more than one lesson.

1507
01:57:53,073 --> 01:57:55,507
And you'll get more than one lesson.

1508
01:58:00,814 --> 01:58:02,304
Who's a busy man, me?

1509
01:58:02,549 --> 01:58:05,848
I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time.

1510
01:58:06,053 --> 01:58:07,486
What do you want to know?

1511
01:58:07,554 --> 01:58:12,218
We thought... If we could find out what he
meant by his last words as he was dying...

1512
01:58:12,693 --> 01:58:14,854
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1513
01:58:16,229 --> 01:58:17,389
Yes and no.

1514
01:58:17,731 --> 01:58:20,564
<i>"I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper. "</i>

1515
01:58:20,934 --> 01:58:24,461
<i>"I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper. "</i>
