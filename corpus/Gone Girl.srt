1
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:23,813
When I think of my wife...

2
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,703
...I always think of her head.

3
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,065
I picture cracking her lovely skull...

4
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,366
Unspooling her brains...

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,040
Trying to get answers.

6
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:42,748
The primal questions of any marriage.

7
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,133
"What are you thinking?"

8
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,420
"How are you feeling?"

9
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,094
"What have we done to each other?"

10
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:29,072
The Irish prince
graces us with his presence.

11
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,864
His majesty prefers not to be moistened.

12
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,362
I got you a present.

13
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,410
- I hated this game.
- You loved it.

14
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,741
You loved it.

15
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,076
Thank you.
I'll add it to the collection.

16
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,042
Can you pour me a bourbon?

17
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,377
What's up, jitters?

18
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,435
Well, if you're not going to talk,
I'm gonna have to fill the silence...

19
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,852
With another excruciating story
by margo dunne.

20
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,562
I could tell you about
my recent customer service experience...

21
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,613
- Changing Internet service providers.
- I like that one.

22
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,517
Or how about the time I saw that woman
who looked exactly like my friend Monica?

23
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,487
But it wasn't Monica.
It was a total stranger.

24
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,447
Who was also named Monica.

25
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,624
- Made it kind of interesting.
- It's great.

26
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,570
I'm just having a bad day.

27
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,576
- Amy?
- It's our anniversary.

28
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,578
- Five years.
- Five?

29
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,790
That came fast.

30
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,160
And furious.

31
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,801
I'm so crazy, stupid happy.

32
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,093
I met a boy.

33
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:42,565
A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy.

34
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,098
Excuse me, miss?

35
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,603
I just want you to be careful...

36
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,444
Where you put down that
monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...

37
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,190
Because the party's down to three
beast lights and a bottle of pucker.

38
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,943
It might attract
some desperate characters.

39
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,825
It could.
I mean, the amish are on a rumspringa.

40
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,449
They already relieved me
of my artisanal meat platter.

41
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,374
Finally, someone tells me
how to pronounce that word.

42
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,414
"Meat"?

43
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,665
Yes, "meat." One syllable.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,670
Thank you. Whose beer am I
about to drink?

45
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,001
Don't tell me.

46
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,341
Let's see, who's your type?

47
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,837
I don't see you sitting quietly...

48
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,473
While he bloviates
on his postgrad thesis about proust.

49
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,812
Uh-oh. Is that him?

50
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,128
Ironic hipster, so self-aware,
he makes everything a joke.

51
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,350
I prefer men who are funny, not "funny."

52
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,518
What type are you?

53
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,024
Corn-fed,
salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy.

54
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,186
Missouri?

55
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,154
Cute.

56
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,533
- Native new yorker?
- The world ends at the Hudson.

57
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,650
What's your name?

58
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,696
Amy.

59
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,027
Well, Amy, who are you?

60
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,538
A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander.

61
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,749
B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.

62
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,922
C, I write personality quizzes
for magazines.

63
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,505
Okay. Your hands are far too delicate
for real scrimshaw work...

64
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,800
And I happen to be a charter subscriber
to middling warlord weekly...

65
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,055
So I'd recognize you.

66
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,718
I'm gonna go with "c."

67
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,184
And you?

68
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,556
Who are you?

69
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,941
I'm the guy to save you
from all this awesomeness.

70
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,856
So, you write for a men's magazine.

71
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,164
God, does that make you an expert
on being a man?

72
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,279
No.

73
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,396
It's what to wear, what to drink.

74
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,371
How to bullshit.

75
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,003
Never with you.

76
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,869
Ha, ha.

77
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,535
No, I mean it.

78
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,384
It's hard to believe you.

79
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,209
Why?

80
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,883
I think it's your chin.

81
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,051
My chin?

82
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,759
Yeah, it's quite villainous.

83
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,430
Okay, how's this?

84
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,598
A hundred percent true, no bullshit.

85
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,973
Okay.

86
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,564
We all move to New York...

87
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:54,731
And we end up living in these little
cubby holes, and that's not it.

88
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,231
Come outside. Then, you're in it.

89
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,402
You have to see this.

90
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,044
Hey.

91
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Hey.

92
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,799
I have to kiss you now.

93
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,262
Is that right?

94
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,472
I can't let you go through
a sugar storm unkissed.

95
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,467
Wait a second.

96
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,646
There you go.

97
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,994
Nick dunne...

98
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,834
I really like you.

99
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,252
So, is Amy gonna do
one of those anniversary...

100
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,514
Treasure hunts?

101
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,549
You mean the forced march
designed to prove...

102
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,552
What an oblivious and uncaring asshole
her husband is?

103
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,675
Wow.

104
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,226
Life. I don't remember the point.

105
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,478
Deep hasbro thoughts.

106
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,850
Spin.

107
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,899
What was the clue last year
she got so mad about?

108
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,241
"When your poor Amy has a cold...

109
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,988
"This dessert just must be sold."

110
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,029
The answer?

111
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,820
I still don't know the answer, go.

112
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,026
- A few years ago, you'd have known.
- A few years ago, it was fun.

113
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,736
Year one,
the traditional gift was paper.

114
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,246
She got me a beautiful notebook.
Told me to go write my novel.

115
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,170
What did you get her?

116
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,577
A kite.

117
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,455
- She'd never flown a kite.
- Okay.

118
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,010
Anyway. Year four, flowers.

119
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,297
She led me outside
to the dying rosebush in the backyard.

120
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,684
That's symbolic.

121
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:49,719
Yeah.

122
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,180
What's the gift for five?

123
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,011
Wood.

124
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,515
- So, what did you get her?
- There's no good gift for wood.

125
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,888
I know! Go home, fuck her brains out,
slap her with your penis.

126
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,396
"There's some wood for you, bitch."

127
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,231
The bar.

128
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,405
Why, yes. Hang on one second.

129
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,606
Hey, it's watchful Wally.

130
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,908
Hey, Walt. What's going on?

131
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,367
Thanks very much. I'll be right there.
All right, bye-bye.

132
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:33,264
Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?

133
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,973
Thanks, Walt!

134
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,027
Ame?

135
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,847
Amy!

136
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:28,526
Hello?

137
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,154
Come on in.

138
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:31,704
Hey.

139
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,158
- Mister dunne.
- Hi.

140
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,698
I'm detective Rhonda boney.
This is officer James gilpin.

141
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,702
We understand there are concerns
about your wife.

142
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,664
I don't know where my wife is.
And I came home to this.

143
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,498
Now, I don't panic easily...

144
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,916
But it's weird, right?

145
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:50,173
Mind if we look around?

146
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,344
Please.

147
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,663
How long have you two been here?

148
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,506
Two years in September.
We used to live in New York.

149
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,644
City?

150
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,810
Yeah, I was a writer.
We were both writers.

151
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,480
Why did you all move back here?

152
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,138
My mom got sick.

153
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,147
Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?

154
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,650
She's dead.

155
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:08,691
I'm so sorry.

156
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,696
What do you do now, for work?

157
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,406
My sister margo and I
own the bar downtown.

158
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,710
Oh, the bar.

159
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,997
Love the name. Very meta.

160
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,131
Thanks.

161
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,876
Pretty things.

162
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,975
Stay.

163
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,761
My office, here.

164
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,847
Beautiful dress.

165
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,645
Date night?

166
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,939
It's our anniversary.

167
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,610
It's a guest bedroom, there.

168
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,534
Cat's room on the end.

169
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,122
I checked up here.

170
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,585
This is the kitchen...

171
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,961
Obviously.

172
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,561
This is my wife's office.

173
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,218
Amy's office.

174
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,320
Wow. Impressive gal.

175
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,576
Yeah. Should I be concerned?

176
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,787
I remember these.

177
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,286
I loved these books.

178
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,878
Wait a minute.

179
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,918
Your wife is amazing Amy?

180
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,844
Yeah. She is.

181
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,512
Wow.

182
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:03,141
Amazing-fucking-Amy
is getting fucking married.

183
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,972
That's how the night started.

184
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:11,107
With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,
jealous, as always, of the golden child.

185
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:15,738
Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy,
who's getting fucking married.

186
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,859
When I was 10, I quit cello.

187
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:21,495
In the next book,
amazing Amy became a prodigy.

188
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:24,952
Did you play volleyball?

189
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,875
I got cut, freshman year.

190
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,834
She made varsity.

191
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,250
When did you have a dog?

192
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,294
She got the dog.

193
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,421
Puddles made her more relatable.

194
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:37,805
Wow.

195
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,971
I love your parents...

196
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,800
But they really can be assholes.

197
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,295
- Nick!
- Sir!

198
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,137
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

199
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:45,972
No problem.

200
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,426
Hey, sweetheart.

201
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,438
Big night for your mom.

202
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:53,308
It would mean so much
if you would talk to a few reporters...

203
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,227
Bloggers, give them a little Amy color.

204
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,145
People wanna hear from you.

205
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,824
- We can't stay long.
- Fantastic.

206
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,032
Fifteen minutes, tops.

207
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:05,665
This is why I have my brownstone.
My trust fund. I know I can't complain.

208
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,332
Your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood.

209
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:12,422
No, they improved upon it,
and then peddled it to the masses.

210
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,669
I thought you were gonna wear white
to match the wedding theme.

211
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,171
I thought that would be creepy.

212
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,673
"If it's worth doing,
it's worth doing..."

213
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,045
hold up! I know how this ends.
Don't tell me.

214
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,893
You're very cute, Nick.

215
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,568
Amy, you know
what would make dad's night.

216
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,216
I'm on it.

217
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,516
I love having strangers
pick at my scabs.

218
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:31,811
I'm curious whether...

219
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,564
It's difficult for you to see
amazing Amy heading down the aisle.

220
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,029
And this big party
celebrating this fictional wedding.

221
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,397
Because it's my understanding
you are not married.

222
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,114
Is that correct?

223
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:45,832
Correct. Amazing Amy has always been
one step ahead of me.

224
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:49,698
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I just have a few questions.

225
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,000
It's you.

226
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,579
I'm here in a
strictly journalistic capacity.

227
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:57,206
Now, you had the distinct pleasure
of dating Nick dunne for how long?

228
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,054
- Two magical years.
- Two magical years.

229
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,930
In the course of that time,
you've had the opportunity...

230
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,427
To perform such gracious gestures as...

231
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:08,389
Not correcting Nick when he
pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."

232
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,892
An understandable mistake.

233
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,133
He also thought it was a fish.

234
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,733
He thinks velveeta is a cheese.

235
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,060
You also manage to appear
shocked and delighted...

236
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,686
When Nick's elderly mother
breaks into an impromptu rendition...

237
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,944
Of New York, New York,
every time she sees you.

238
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,026
[S]These bag of bone shoes

239
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,241
that's just frightening.

240
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,911
You also bought Nick
his very first pair of scissors.

241
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,620
And matching stapler.

242
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,580
Amy elliott, you are more than amazing.

243
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:35,132
You are brilliant,
yet entirely un-snobby.

244
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,797
You challenge me. You surprise me.

245
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,167
And, fun fact for the readers...

246
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,299
You have a world-class vagina.

247
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,433
My colleagues tell me
that you are not yet married.

248
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,761
Is that correct?

249
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,266
I'm not.

250
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,638
Isn't it time we fixed that?

251
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,772
And then...

252
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,652
The night wasn't so bad anymore.

253
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,498
And it's done. Crossed off the list.

254
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:21,503
Now, normally, we would not treat this
as a missing persons case so quick...

255
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:22,987
But given the scene at your house...

256
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,126
And given our spike
in violent crime of late...

257
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,635
We are gonna take this
very, very seriously.

258
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:28,678
Okay. Good.

259
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,969
We've got forensics over at your place.
You got somewhere to stay?

260
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,595
- I could stay at my sister's.
- Okay.

261
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,942
We're tracking Amy's phone,
her credit cards.

262
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,648
We will organize searches,
put up flyers.

263
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:40,688
- We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.
- You're having a press conference?

264
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,322
I wanna get the word out, right?

265
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:46,649
Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,
I feel like I'm on a law & order episode.

266
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,875
Time is of the essence in these cases.

267
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,665
But, that said,
do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?

268
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,840
Absolutely not. I just wanna help.

269
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,668
So, you and Amy
have been here two years.

270
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:05,973
- You tend bar...
- I own the bar.

271
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:09,508
And I teach creative writing at mvcc.

272
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,353
- No kids?
- Not yet.

273
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,848
So, what does Amy do most days?

274
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,100
A woman with all those degrees,
what does she do?

275
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,021
I don't know. She keeps busy.

276
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,560
Doing what?

277
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,402
She's a voracious reader.

278
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:25,281
So, she's always got a book in her hand.

279
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,821
Well, days can get long.

280
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:31,703
I know a few housewives, that evening
glass of wine starts coming at noon.

281
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,032
Or prescription pills.

282
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,576
Just last week, we had a soccer mom.

283
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,080
Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in
over some oxycontin.

284
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,212
Ever since that mall went bust,
half the town is out of work.

285
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,749
We cannot keep up
with the drug violence.

286
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,212
I'm pretty sure that's not it.

287
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,093
Has Amy got friends we can talk to?

288
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,380
No, not really.

289
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,385
No friends? This whole town?

290
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:54,057
She was very close with my mom,
before she passed away.

291
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,217
You know, we have a pretty serious
homeless problem...

292
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,386
In our neighborhood.

293
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,486
I think maybe you guys
should check that out.

294
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:01,771
We'll look into that.

295
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,443
You got to the bar around 11:00 today.

296
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,073
Where were you before that?
Just to cross that out.

297
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,109
Well, I was home.

298
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,740
I left at 9:30,
I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.

299
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,410
I went to Sawyer beach
and read the news.

300
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,618
Did you visit with anyone there?

301
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,619
I kind of go to Sawyer beach
for the solitude.

302
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,367
So, your wife has no friends here.

303
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,254
Is she kinda standoffish?

304
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,711
Ivy league? Rubs people the wrong way?

305
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,252
She's from New York.

306
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,761
She's complicated.
She's got very high standards.

307
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Type a?

308
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,548
That can make you crazy
if you're not like that.

309
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,425
You seem pretty laid-back. Type b.

310
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,643
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?

311
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,984
God, I don't know.
I'd have to look it up at the house.

312
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,809
You don't know if she has friends,
you don't know what she does all day...

313
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,766
And you don't know
your wife's blood type.

314
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:46,936
Sure you all are married?

315
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:49,694
Maybe it's type o.

316
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,915
- Where are her folks? New York?
- Yeah.

317
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,657
Can they get here time
for this press conference tomorrow?

318
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,739
Tomorrow? I have no idea.
I haven't talked to them.

319
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,624
You haven't called
your wife's parents yet?

320
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,081
You can't get a signal in this building.
I've been in here talking to you.

321
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,582
Call them, please, Nick. Now.

322
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:03,834
Fine.

323
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,299
Should I know my wife's blood type?

324
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,341
No.

325
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:16,466
I apologize, marybeth.
I didn't know what was going on.

326
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,013
Now I'm at the station...

327
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,556
And the cops are at the house,
and it's serious and I'm calling you.

328
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,229
There's a lot of things
that are being juggled right now.

329
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:28,532
I'm standing right next to
detective Rhonda boney...

330
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,527
Who's the lead investigator on this
and she's...

331
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,949
My mother-in-law
would like to speak with you.

332
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,656
This is detective boney.

333
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,041
I wanna go home.

334
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,537
I don't know why I have to be here.

335
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,210
I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.

336
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,379
Dad?

337
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,382
This is my father. What's going on?

338
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,459
Really? You're Nick dunne?

339
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,712
We've been trying to get a hold of you
all afternoon.

340
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,416
I've been right there.
My wife is missing.

341
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,586
- Bitch.
- Don't.

342
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,014
Your father wandered out of comfort hill
after lunch.

343
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,433
We found him walking route 79,
disoriented.

344
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,932
We've been trying to call you
for the last...

345
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,223
I don't get a cell signal
in this building.

346
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,226
I've been sitting
20 feet away from you.

347
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,190
Sir, please
don't take that tone with me.

348
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,349
Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.

349
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,936
Dad, stop.

350
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:11,819
You wanna drive him home?

351
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,776
I think that would be wise. Thanks.

352
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:37,431
This voice mailbox is currently full.

353
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,345
Fuck.

354
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:44,063
Get your fucking hands off me.

355
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,481
Thanks.

356
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:02,452
Everyone told us
and told us and told us...

357
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,084
Marriage is hard work.

358
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:08,172
And compromise and more work.

359
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,458
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter."

360
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,422
"When young Amy's hope did wane...

361
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,803
"She wandered here..."

362
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,340
Well, it's not true.
Not for me and Nick.

363
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,014
"...in search of Jane."

364
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,973
With us, two years...

365
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,643
It's just good.

366
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,982
Austen.

367
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:32,478
You were an alienated teen
and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you.

368
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,983
Look at that.

369
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,200
My God.

370
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:39,987
You naughty minx.

371
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:43,122
Well, technically, we are supposed
to fuck at the next stop.

372
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,790
Yeah, in keeping with tradition.

373
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:48,328
But I might be willing
to bend the rules this once.

374
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,083
God bless Jane Austen.

375
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:09,442
I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.
It's confirmed by the...

376
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,687
Thank you.

377
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,194
Year two. Cotton.

378
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:28,201
We had that joke that our sex
was too good for ordinary.

379
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,707
So, these are 2,000 thread-count...

380
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,674
we're so cute.
I wanna punch us in the face.

381
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,925
That's pretty great.
I mean, that is pretty great.

382
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,847
Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?

383
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,058
I don't need a lawyer.
Here, I'll do this.

384
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,518
Well, did they ask personal stuff
about Amy?

385
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,730
You know, they asked...

386
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:52,521
Why didn't she have any friends?

387
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:53,403
What did you say?

388
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,438
- I said she was complicated.
- Nick!

389
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,071
Everyone knows "complicated"
is code for "bitch."

390
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,281
God. I feel sick.

391
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,736
Thanks.

392
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,035
It's so bizarre.

393
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,580
It seems like the kind of thing
that would happen to Amy.

394
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:13,794
She always attracts...

395
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,424
Drama?

396
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,633
You can say it. It's just me and you.

397
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,221
Just because
I don't like to be around Amy...

398
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,697
Doesn't mean I don't care about her.

399
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,765
Anyway, whoever took her
is bound to bring her back.

400
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,146
Detective? Excuse me.

401
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,822
I'm noelle hawthorne.
I'm Amy's best friend.

402
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:44,605
Well, great. Where do you live, noelle?

403
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,657
Five doors down. 1032.

404
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,910
Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.

405
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,832
Can I come by in half an hour?

406
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,581
- Y'all know anything yet?
- I'm sorry.

407
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:55,423
I got guys on the clock in here.
But you give me 30 minutes.

408
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,789
But that's usually bath time.

409
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:00,134
Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.

410
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,183
All right. So, what do you got?

411
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,848
It was definitely blood spatter
you saw in the kitchen.

412
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,006
Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.

413
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,426
Not that weird,
but that is awfully high.

414
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,105
So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.

415
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,313
Well, okay.

416
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,112
Interesting.

417
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,268
What's that?

418
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:22,816
House is rented in her name.
Car's in her name.

419
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,991
Credit cards, utilities,
phone bill, all in her name.

420
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,871
Even his bar's in her name.

421
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,828
I don't know that that's so surprising.

422
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,488
No. But it is humiliating.

423
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:32,447
What you got?

424
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:35,326
It's with her unmentionables.

425
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:50,558
Well, we have our first clue.

426
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,320
I have to take a shower.

427
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,150
No, don't. You've been up all night.

428
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,355
You wanna look
like you've been up all night.

429
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,331
Hey, be careful today, okay?

430
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,698
That's a weird thing to say.

431
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:16,504
Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.
You can seem angry, like...

432
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,040
please don't say, "like dad."

433
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,843
Or else you swing into your momma's-boy
charm offensive and that can feel glib.

434
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:21,668
Perfect.

435
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:24,462
I'll balance on the exact fucking edge
of your emotional razor.

436
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,336
Okay. Just be...

437
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,303
Myself?

438
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,683
...sponsoring a raffle to
benefit west county 4h...

439
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:34,181
And raffling season tickets for
mizzou football.

440
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:37,524
Buy your tickets at the wing hut or
local tri-state tire stores.

441
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,437
Your in-laws made it.

442
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,494
- Hi, rand.
- Hey, man.

443
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,358
I'm detective boney.

444
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,364
I'm the twin. Margo.

445
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,486
We played tennis yesterday, Nick.
I just can't get over it.

446
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,874
Marybeth, I am really sorry.

447
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,701
I knew you never should have
moved back here.

448
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:56,866
We didn't have a lot of choice.

449
00:24:56,914 --> 00:25:00,584
We are all worried. We are all scared.

450
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:05,086
But we are all here now.
And we will find Amy, together.

451
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,227
Should I just go first, and then
you guys can say something?

452
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,267
Good.

453
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:24,235
As you know, my wife,
Amy elliott dunne...

454
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:27,074
Disappeared from our home
on the morning of July 5th...

455
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,568
Under suspicious circumstances.

456
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,074
Louder!

457
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:36,535
If anyone out there
has any information...

458
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,908
Please come forward.

459
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:40,576
Thank you.

460
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:45,748
I'm rand elliott.
My wife, marybeth elliott.

461
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:46,876
Should I have said my name?

462
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,424
Amy is our only child.

463
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:53,466
She's bright, she's beautiful.
She's kind.

464
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,471
She really is amazing Amy.

465
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:58,516
You know, there are
millions of people out there...

466
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,099
Who grew up with her and care about her.

467
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,774
We care about her, we love her.

468
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:07,071
And we just want her back.

469
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,606
Amy is a decorated scholar.

470
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:14,625
She forged a successful career
in journalism.

471
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,948
She returned here
to her husband's hometown...

472
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,334
And she made a life in her adopted home.

473
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,794
Now, Amy needs your help.

474
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:26,963
We're establishing a volunteer
headquarters at the drury lodge.

475
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:32,344
We have a hotline, 1-855-4-Amy-tips.

476
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:38,013
And our website is
www.Findamazingamy.Com.

477
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,475
- Mr. dunne!
- Mr. elliott!

478
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:43,692
Mr. dunne, any signs of foul play?

479
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:49,109
Mr. elliott, when was the last time
you spoke to your daughter?

480
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:51,611
Smile.

481
00:26:58,202 --> 00:26:59,792
That's all for now. Thank you.

482
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:05,212
Amy is the kind of girl
who attracts admirers.

483
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,130
Right, Nick?

484
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:07,338
Yeah, definitely.

485
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,877
And we've had instances...

486
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:11,972
- Where things got...
- scary.

487
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,467
Do you know about desi collings?

488
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:15,179
Yeah, I know all about desi collings.

489
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:16,469
He was obsessed.

490
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:19,852
He attempted suicide after Amy
broke up with him sophomore year.

491
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,430
We had to file a restraining order.

492
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:23,855
This would be high school?
Twenty years ago?

493
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:27,114
But he recently moved to St. Louis.
That's just two hours away.

494
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,017
To be fair, he is from St. Louis.

495
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:30,686
We also have Tommy O'Hara.

496
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,944
This is only eight years ago,
in New York.

497
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,276
She broke up with him,
he got very physical.

498
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,002
- She filed charges.
- What was the charge?

499
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,122
Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?

500
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:41,119
I only know it was bad.

501
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,951
- I didn't know this.
- Okay.

502
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,906
Thank you.

503
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:46,247
Anything more recent?

504
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,586
Not that I know of.

505
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,969
Hey, Nick? You got a minute?

506
00:27:58,136 --> 00:27:59,756
Yeah.

507
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:06,523
Imagine our confusion.

508
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:07,732
A missing persons case...

509
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,361
And in your wife's dressing room,
we find an envelope marked "clue."

510
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,649
That's for our anniversary.

511
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:14,993
My wife does these treasure hunts.

512
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,408
I'm hoping you can tell me
what this means.

513
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:18,447
You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?

514
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:21,186
It'll help me track Amy's movements
before she disappeared.

515
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,580
Of course. Okay.

516
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,210
"Although this spot
couldn't be tighter...

517
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:29,667
"It's a cozy room
for my favorite writer."

518
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:33,714
I know this one!

519
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:37,724
Although this spot
couldn't be any tighter...

520
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:41,143
It's a cozy room for my favorite writer.

521
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:46,059
After-school meeting,
don't mind if I do.

522
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:49,021
Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.

523
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,396
Well, well. What does it say?

524
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:56,954
Clue two.

525
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:01,451
"Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.

526
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,830
"You'll be the spy,
and I'll be his lover.

527
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,370
"Let's head on over...

528
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,294
"To the little brown house.

529
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:13,043
"We'll play hot, doting husband,
sweet, loving spouse."

530
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,089
These yours?

531
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:18,716
No.

532
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,219
But you read the first clue.

533
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,390
Randy Professor, naughty student.

534
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,470
I blush.

535
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,275
Me and my ex just swapped cards.

536
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:28,846
Where's this little brown house?

537
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:30,404
I have no idea.

538
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:14,975
Hello?

539
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:17,529
Nicholas dunne.

540
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:21,283
Under my father's name, William dunne.

541
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:31,793
My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?
Can you just turn the bell...

542
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:32,832
yeah, I know.

543
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,463
It's... it's...

544
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,210
It's "puddles," right?
Or is it "poodles?"

545
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,765
We're good.

546
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,466
Hello, stranger.

547
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,644
Fancy meeting you here.

548
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,983
It's your dad's house, right?

549
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,649
Are you following me?

550
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:54,557
What you doing?

551
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:56,775
Like you said, it's my dad's house.

552
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:59,525
I come by once a week,
make sure the place hasn't burned down.

553
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,610
But it looks okay.

554
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,243
I'll walk you out.

555
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,993
You know...

556
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:13,287
I thought maybe
this was the little brown house.

557
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:14,542
From the clue.

558
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,543
Nope. Still blue.

559
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:37,228
Picture me,
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

560
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:40,982
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had."

561
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:44,615
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

562
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:48,665
"So open the door, and look alive."

563
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:50,992
Bitch!

564
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,706
Want to test your marriage
for weak spots?

565
00:31:58,377 --> 00:31:59,837
Add one recession...

566
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,460
Subtract two jobs.

567
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:04,167
It's surprisingly effective.

568
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:06,626
Promise me we'll never be like them.

569
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:07,797
Like who?

570
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:09,605
All those awful couples we know.

571
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:13,598
Those wives who treat their men
like dancing monkeys...

572
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:15,102
To be trained and paraded.

573
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:18,437
Husbands who treat their wives
like the highway patrol...

574
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:21,404
To be out-foxed and avoided.

575
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,824
I think I'm gonna be laid off.

576
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:31,405
We're in a recession.
If it happens, we'll deal with it.

577
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,661
I'll probably be next.

578
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:34,954
We have each other.

579
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,870
Everything else is background noise.

580
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,749
You are exceptional.

581
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:49,718
My turn.

582
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:55,057
My parents' publisher dropped them,
and they're in debt up to their ears.

583
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,930
That's terrible.

584
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:58,396
And they need to borrow
from my trust fund.

585
00:32:58,437 --> 00:32:59,937
How much?

586
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,190
Almost a million.

587
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,364
That's almost all of it.

588
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,701
This is where you say,
"everything else is background noise."

589
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:07,777
Amy, if you're laid off...

590
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,196
And I'm laid off...

591
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,369
I said I'd do it.

592
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:11,657
Without talking to me?

593
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,280
- Well, it's...
- Your call.

594
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:14,907
...their money, technically.

595
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,003
You know what? You're right.

596
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:23,627
Everything else
is just background noise.

597
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:33,596
Hey.

598
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:38,886
More games?

599
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:40,556
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.

600
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,232
What's the laptop for?

601
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:45,316
Laptop-ing.

602
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:48,489
I see.

603
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,529
You can give your parents $879,000
without talking to me...

604
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:54,704
But God forbid I buy a video game
without getting your permission.

605
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:55,793
You are spending a lot.

606
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:58,077
You don't trust me.
You don't trust my judgment.

607
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,681
You certainly don't trust my intention.

608
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:00,666
What are you talking about?

609
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,327
That's the basic tenet
of a prenup, isn't it?

610
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:04,626
Why are you throwing that
in my face again?

611
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,210
Because it's easy to throw.

612
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:07,055
Nick, I don't get it.

613
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:10,429
I don't get why you're daring me
to be someone I don't wanna be.

614
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,547
The nagging shrew.
The controlling bitch.

615
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,965
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.

616
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,184
I'm sorry.

617
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:19,564
I just don't know how to do this.
I've never not had a job.

618
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,601
I flipped burgers, I painted houses.

619
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,655
You'll get another job.

620
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:29,278
Hi, go.

621
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,779
What? Hold on. What?

622
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:34,243
- And suddenly...
- Slow down, what is it?

623
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:36,283
...I knew everything
was about to get worse.

624
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,906
Okay, tell me what's wrong.

625
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:06,772
- Bless you, Nick.
- Father.

626
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,861
Hey, tom. Mayor!

627
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,151
Nick, good to see you.

628
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:11,194
Good to see you.

629
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:12,486
Hey, guys, hey.

630
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:16,407
- Jodie.
- Nick.

631
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,738
Oh, we'll find her.

632
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,428
You look like hammered shit.

633
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,140
Thank you.

634
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,950
You ever see that guy
in the glasses before?

635
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:51,357
Don't worry. We videotape everybody
that comes in and out of these things.

636
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:53,191
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...

637
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,277
Do-gooders?

638
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,531
Freaks.

639
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:57,532
Hey, I meant to ask you.

640
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:59,034
Noelle hawthorne?

641
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,630
She lives on your street.
Amy's best friend.

642
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,076
I've never heard the name
noelle hawthorne.

643
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,292
She and her husband have triplets.

644
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,333
Oh.

645
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:10,456
Yeah, we might say hi to them
on the street.

646
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:13,008
But "best friend"? No.

647
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:14,759
Excuse me, one sec.

648
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:21,144
He acted like
noelle was a complete stranger.

649
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,271
Of course he did.

650
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:23,931
Look, these two are yours.

651
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:26,346
Oh, look. He's being a good guy...

652
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,315
So everybody can see him
being a good guy.

653
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,145
You really don't like him, do you?

654
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,690
What's to like?

655
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,010
This mailbox is currently full.
Press one to...

656
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,430
Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.
My name's shawna Kelly.

657
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:03,389
I am so sorry for your troubles.

658
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:04,352
Thank you. That's kind.

659
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:05,811
Are you remembering to eat?

660
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:06,981
Well, a lot of cold cuts.

661
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:11,189
I'm gonna fix you up
my world-famous chicken frito pie.

662
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,751
That's very kind and very unnecessary.

663
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,404
You have to keep your strength.

664
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:15,943
Would you...

665
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,700
Say, "chicken frito pie!"

666
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,200
You know what?

667
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:26,834
Would you delete that picture for me?

668
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:28,752
- It's a nice photo.
- I know it is.

669
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,210
But just do me a favor.

670
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,000
Will you?

671
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:34,964
Would you go ahead
and please delete that picture?

672
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,005
You just press...

673
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:37,548
What is wrong with you?

674
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:38,881
Could you please not
share that with anyone?

675
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:42,256
I will share it with whomever I please.

676
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:47,428
- Dude.
- Yeah?

677
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:48,806
Marybeth is pissed.

678
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Why?

679
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,770
Marybeth?

680
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,236
It's like you're the goddamn
homecoming king.

681
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,116
It was important to my mother
that I be polite...

682
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,078
I be considerate, I be a gentleman.

683
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,828
It looked like you were having fun.

684
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,120
I am in a nightmare!

685
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:12,251
All I'm trying to do is be nice...

686
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:16,002
To the people who are
volunteering to help find Amy.

687
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,725
You're right.

688
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,552
And I'm sorry.

689
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:28,185
My God, this place literally
smells like feces.

690
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:42,492
In your searches,
did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?

691
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:43,951
No.

692
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:46,785
How about a brand new stratocaster?

693
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:47,947
No, nothing like that.

694
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:50,752
Well, all right.

695
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:58,802
How big's that TV? It's not 65-inch.

696
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,129
No, it's nowhere near that.

697
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:01,264
Okay.

698
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:03,127
- Kibble?
- Excuse me?

699
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:05,257
He asked me to feed his cat.

700
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:06,514
I saw some in the pantry.

701
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:11,597
Detective boney, officer gilpin?
Noelle hawthorne!

702
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:13,233
I know y'all are in there!

703
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,770
Would you please escort miss hawthorne
and her children back out to the street?

704
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,740
Detective boney!

705
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:24,607
Just remind her
it is a possible crime scene.

706
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:38,172
Look at that pie-eating grin,
from a guy whose wife is missing.

707
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:45,547
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

708
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:48,814
How's marybeth?

709
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,677
She's a wreck.

710
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,184
And you?

711
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:54,439
Awesome.

712
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:55,478
Hey...

713
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,059
Have you told me everything?

714
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:58,314
Of course.

715
00:39:58,315 --> 00:39:59,315
Everything?

716
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:00,476
Why would you even ask me that?

717
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:04,696
Ever since you walked into the bar that
morning Amy went missing, you seem...

718
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:06,989
- Off.
- I am off.

719
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,373
Everybody's examining me
and projecting their shit on me.

720
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,831
All I want is to come over here,
have a beer with you...

721
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,213
And not be judged.

722
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,750
Can we do that?

723
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:20,166
Of course.

724
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:23,547
You know what I keep thinking?

725
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,630
If mom were here?

726
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:28,095
Yeah. Like I'm 12.

727
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:32,355
Nick, mom would fix it.

728
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:42,785
I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.

729
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:48,026
- Love you.
- Love you.

730
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,409
So, here's a strange, new sentence.

731
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:57,924
I am a missourian.

732
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:06,095
Bye, dad.

733
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,470
No money, no jobs, no prospects.

734
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:13,683
And then, we heard from go.

735
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:15,644
Mama Maureen...

736
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:18,524
Stage 4 breast cancer.

737
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:23,529
So, we moved to Missouri.

738
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,187
I don't mind.

739
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:28,405
I just wish he'd asked.

740
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,543
Nick is happy to be home.

741
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:45,086
But I don't know
if he's happy I'm with him.

742
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,840
I feel like something
he loaded by mistake.

743
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:53,055
Something to be jettisoned,
if necessary.

744
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,306
Something disposable.

745
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:59,772
I feel like I could disappear.

746
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:45,772
Oh, my God!

747
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:47,776
- I saw you on TV.
- Okay.

748
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:49,488
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

749
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:51,738
- She just vanished?
- She's just gone.

750
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,620
- I've been so worried about you.
- Where have you been?

751
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:55,487
I called you a hundred times.
You gotta pick up your phone!

752
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:56,584
Rehearsals.

753
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:57,658
What?

754
00:42:57,703 --> 00:42:59,003
Godspell.

755
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,421
My sister's asleep in the other room.

756
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:03,577
I needed to see you.

757
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,285
I know this is a bad idea.

758
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:06,835
Can you at least tell me you love me?

759
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,629
I do love you, but we have
to be really careful right now.

760
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:11,934
I've been so scared.

761
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,177
Between rehearsals?

762
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:14,968
You told me
I needed to have my own life.

763
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:16,512
I know.

764
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:17,815
We need to stop.

765
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:19,018
I need you.

766
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:21,982
Touch me.

767
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:28,017
Stop it. Come here.

768
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,111
Sit down.

769
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:32,493
Okay.

770
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:36,619
Did you, by any chance,
tell anybody anything about us?

771
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,158
Even in texting, or on Facebook.

772
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:41,002
Facebook? I use the disposable phone.

773
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:42,958
You buy my presents in cash.
I'm not stupid, Nick.

774
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:45,878
I know, sweetie. Did you leave a
pair of red panties in my office?

775
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:49,338
I don't know. Maybe.
They better be mine.

776
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:50,379
Sweetheart, think.

777
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,840
I don't know. I'd have to check
my red panty inventory.

778
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:55,513
Andie, I need you
to take this seriously, okay?

779
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,352
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other, until...

780
00:43:57,387 --> 00:43:58,847
Until when?

781
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:00,849
Until it's safe.

782
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:02,481
You were going to get a divorce.

783
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:04,688
Never say that out loud again.

784
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,398
Okay. I'm sorry.

785
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:09,273
I don't wanna fight.

786
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:12,856
I just wanna be with you.

787
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:14,073
Andie, please...

788
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:16,575
That's all I want.

789
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:18,988
I can't.

790
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:23,578
It's our last time together.

791
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:25,672
Let's make the most of it.

792
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:35,762
Real quick, but then you have to go.

793
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:41,385
My husband has come undone.

794
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:44,391
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...

795
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:47,154
But as it turns out, we couldn't.

796
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,190
It means a lot that you came.

797
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,740
We took a hit on the brownstone...

798
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:57,108
And I used the last of my trust fund
to buy him a bar.

799
00:44:57,865 --> 00:45:00,125
So far, it's just costing money.

800
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:08,119
Nick uses me for sex when he wants.

801
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,805
Otherwise, I don't exist.

802
00:45:15,048 --> 00:45:17,128
We should go to outback tonight.

803
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:18,426
That would be nice.

804
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:21,548
Last night, I went from desperate
to pathetic.

805
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:25,642
I became someone I don't even like.

806
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,484
The kind of woman I used to mock.

807
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:29,605
You're out so much.

808
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:31,976
- I know.
- Stay home.

809
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:34,364
- I can't, I'm already late.
- Then, can I come?

810
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:36,191
You would hate it.

811
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:39,486
It's a bunch
of my dorky high school friends.

812
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,370
Do our code. No bullshit.

813
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:46,197
I thought
we weren't gonna be that couple.

814
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:54,551
Okay, bye.

815
00:45:56,215 --> 00:45:59,185
- Hey, I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

816
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:00,588
Something positive.

817
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:03,052
Maybe it's time.

818
00:46:04,348 --> 00:46:06,178
Now is literally the worst time.

819
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:07,465
It would be a new start for us.

820
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:10,404
And for me,
I would have a real purpose here.

821
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,647
A child is not a hobby.

822
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:12,688
Not a hobby.

823
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:14,900
An inspiration.

824
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:18,572
We could have had this fight
four hours ago. I'm late.

825
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:19,862
I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.

826
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:23,325
You really wanna be the couple
that has a baby to save their marriage?

827
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:24,367
"Save"?

828
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:27,038
Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!

829
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:29,249
- And you're gonna walk out the door now?
- Yeah!

830
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:31,829
You're a fucking coward.

831
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,745
No, it can't go on like this.

832
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:34,844
Really?

833
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:36,378
- I won't.
- You won't?

834
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,761
You won't?
Why, it's not good enough for you?

835
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:39,719
It's not even close!

836
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:41,888
You stupid bitch!

837
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:45,429
What scared me
wasn't that he'd pushed me.

838
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:49,312
What scared me was how much
he wanted to hurt me more.

839
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:51,733
What scared me
was that I'd finally realized...

840
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:56,399
I am frightened of my own husband.

841
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,787
You want me to call for backup?

842
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,920
Nah, I'll protect you.

843
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:21,093
Jesus.

844
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:28,808
They ought to burn this place down.

845
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:30,926
Seems like folks are trying.

846
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,730
You really think this is anything?

847
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:40,935
Cross it off the list.

848
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,749
Hey, Jason.

849
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,330
What's up, Rhonda?

850
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,625
"...and dedicated to the proposition
that all men..."

851
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:01,212
- Have you seen this girl around here?
- Why do you ask?

852
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:03,305
She was reported missing.

853
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,350
"...and so dedicated, can long endure."

854
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:10,308
Yeah. I remember her.

855
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:12,479
What did she want?
Weed, pills?

856
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:15,154
She wanted a gun.

857
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:17,435
I told her it's not my thing.

858
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:20,481
I felt bad, though.
She seemed really desperate.

859
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:24,106
She said it needed to be small,
so she could keep it close.

860
00:48:24,154 --> 00:48:25,994
Are you sure this is her?

861
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:28,161
You don't forget a girl like that
in here.

862
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:30,659
She was all in pink.

863
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:33,252
It was Valentine's day.

864
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:38,958
For Valentine's day,
I thought I'd buy a gun.

865
00:48:39,002 --> 00:48:41,592
That is how crazy I've become.

866
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:46,803
Nick wants me gone
but he won't ask for a divorce.

867
00:48:46,844 --> 00:48:50,974
In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,
his only line of credit.

868
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:52,524
The bitch with the prenup.

869
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:56,691
I could go home to my parents...

870
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:59,148
But I'd have to tell them the truth.

871
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:03,029
And I don't even know
if I believe the truth.

872
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:05,858
Can I really think Nick would hurt me?

873
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,868
I'm being paranoid. Crazy.

874
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,200
It's just...

875
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,700
I'd sleep better with a gun.

876
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:27,011
Oh, shit.

877
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,680
Wake up, baby.
My sister's gonna come out here.

878
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:37,268
- Sorry to rush you.
- It's okay.

879
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:40,729
- Here. Let me help you.
- Okay.

880
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:42,862
Just get that.

881
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:47,027
Be very careful.

882
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:48,863
I'm all right.

883
00:49:48,906 --> 00:49:51,486
Here you go.

884
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,413
Promise me we'll talk every day.

885
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:54,702
Okay, we will.

886
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:57,465
Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.

887
00:49:58,248 --> 00:49:59,328
Don't go crazy.

888
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:00,634
Okay.

889
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:08,377
You fucking idiot.

890
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:12,255
You fucking asshole!
You fucking lied to my fucking face!

891
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:15,314
I'm sorry.

892
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,100
How old is she?

893
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:19,635
She's in her early 20s.

894
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:21,562
How long?

895
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:24,895
- A year and a half.
- You lied to me for over a year?

896
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:26,622
If I told you,
you would have made me stop.

897
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:28,242
It's so fucking small.

898
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:31,238
You're a liar and a cheat!
You're just like dad!

899
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:32,571
How did you even meet her?

900
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:33,826
She's one of my students.

901
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:36,747
I thought writers hated clichés.

902
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:37,617
I'm not a writer.

903
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:39,913
"Boo-hoo, I got laid off.
I guess I'll fuck a teenager."

904
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:42,747
It wasn't like that, okay? You have
no idea how shitty it was with Amy...

905
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,713
How fucking terrible she made me feel.

906
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:47,923
Flyover boy.
I would get knots in my stomach...

907
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:49,805
Just coming home,
knowing she would be sitting there...

908
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:52,002
Dissatisfied, before I even
walked in the fucking door.

909
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,430
This is so bad.

910
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,560
If anybody finds out,
you're totally fucked.

911
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:58,217
Boney found a pair of panties
in my office...

912
00:50:58,267 --> 00:50:59,807
Where, occasionally, Andie and I...

913
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:01,389
I don't know what the fuck it means.

914
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:02,596
Are they super-twat's?

915
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:04,726
Her name is Andie.

916
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:06,273
She's not entirely sure.

917
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:07,976
So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...

918
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:09,436
Who isn't sure
where she leaves her undies?

919
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:11,736
If they're not Andie's,
that means that they're Amy's...

920
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,490
And she left them there for me to find.

921
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:17,292
Nick, I was scared for you before,
and now, I'm fucking petrified.

922
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:19,617
We're having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife...

923
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:22,793
And this morning, you're kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye!

924
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,003
Can you imagine?

925
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:27,956
Have you watched television lately?

926
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:31,015
Cable news is all over your shit.

927
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:33,473
I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?

928
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,800
His wife's nowhere to be found...

929
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:39,516
And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting.
Cute pic, huh?

930
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:42,018
- Who is that?
- Some fucking tragedy groupie.

931
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,980
- Who the fuck is that?
- I don't know.

932
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:45,151
She was trying to give me a casserole.

933
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:48,319
On the show today
we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...

934
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:50,898
Patron Saint to wife-killers everywhere.

935
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:54,705
Tanner bolt, would you actually consider
defending Nick dunne?

936
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,870
Well, let me just say...

937
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:58,658
As always, Ellen,
thank you for such a warm welcome.

938
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,252
But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne.

939
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:03,037
Listen, just because this guy
isn't walking around weeping...

940
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:04,501
That doesn't mean that he's not hurting.

941
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:07,881
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath
is a lack of empathy.

942
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,880
But the truth is,
you'd have to be a sociopath...

943
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,170
To behave normally in this situation...

944
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,966
Because it's the most
abnormal situation in the world.

945
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,680
Tanner, are you trying to tell me
that this photo...

946
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:19,971
Is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior?

947
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:22,675
I'm so sick
of being picked apart by women.

948
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:25,941
You need to hire Tanner bolt.

949
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:28,823
I don't deserve this.

950
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:30,727
Innocent until proven guilty.

951
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:33,146
That's exactly what you deserve.

952
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:34,745
Go home, Nick.

953
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:02,142
Hey, buddy.

954
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:19,821
I can't believe
we haven't arrested this guy.

955
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:21,827
We're not gonna arrest anybody...

956
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,429
Just because some blonde dunce says so.

957
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:26,287
Why are you going so easy on him?
You got a crush?

958
00:53:26,582 --> 00:53:29,922
One, I am conducting an investigation,
not a witch-hunt.

959
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,880
And, two,
don't talk to me that way, ever.

960
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,210
She was trying to buy a gun.

961
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:35,425
We don't know who
or what was scaring her, gil.

962
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:36,465
Give me the update.

963
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:39,587
No drug angles panned out yet,
so cross that off the list.

964
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:41,596
I talked to the nurses
who care for Nick's father.

965
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:44,348
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as
a kitten, so cross that off the list.

966
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:45,561
- Hey.
- Hey.

967
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:49,021
So, luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of July.

968
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:50,362
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

969
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:51,517
The blood is profuse.

970
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:53,785
It is Amy's, type b,
and we should have DNA soon.

971
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:54,897
Thoughts on a weapon?

972
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:56,863
Trajectory indicates blunt force.

973
00:53:56,904 --> 00:53:59,244
Maybe a club or a two-by-four.

974
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:03,083
She fell there,
but I doubt she got back up.

975
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:04,538
Amy's medical records come in?

976
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:06,578
No, we'll have them later tonight.

977
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:09,585
My wife says he's a killer.

978
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:12,173
Well, if Tiffany says...

979
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:38,778
Hey.

980
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:40,112
Hey.

981
00:54:44,535 --> 00:54:45,695
Thank you all for coming out.

982
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,001
Hey Donnie, how are you?

983
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:52,379
Rich, thank you so much.

984
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:00,685
Hey.

985
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:11,314
Thank you, folks.
Thank you for being here tonight.

986
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:13,153
It just means the world to our family.

987
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,149
And to Amy.

988
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:17,732
As you all know...

989
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:21,859
My wife, Amy elliott dunne...

990
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:23,405
Disappeared three days ago.

991
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:27,541
And I want to implore anyone
who has any information at all...

992
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:30,498
Please come forward. Help us.

993
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:31,459
So hot.

994
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:32,868
He is so creepy.

995
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:36,376
I wanna say something, because I think
some of you might be wondering...

996
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,340
And are too polite to ask.

997
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:41,929
I had nothing to do
with the disappearance of my wife.

998
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:44,469
I'm cooperating with the police.

999
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:46,551
I haven't hired a lawyer.

1000
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:47,717
I have nothing to hide.

1001
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:51,516
Amy is my soul mate.

1002
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:53,058
She is brilliant...

1003
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:56,694
She's charming, and wise.

1004
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,734
I love you, Amy.

1005
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:03,953
Asshole.

1006
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:07,202
I love my wife...

1007
00:56:07,576 --> 00:56:08,786
So much.

1008
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:15,628
And I may not behave for the cameras
the way they want me to...

1009
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:19,253
And if they wanna punish me for that,
that's okay.

1010
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:23,006
But I just wanna ask you in the media,
please, harass me...

1011
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,090
But don't harass
the people of this town.

1012
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:28,176
If you need to mock somebody, mock me.

1013
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:29,432
Nick!

1014
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,633
But please don't turn this investigation
into a circus.

1015
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:33,232
Where's your wife, Nick?

1016
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:34,768
Let the police do their jobs.

1017
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:36,809
What did you do to your pregnant wife?

1018
00:56:38,649 --> 00:56:39,899
Did you tell them that, Nick?

1019
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:41,992
Did you tell them
Amy was six weeks pregnant?

1020
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,909
Thank you for your support tonight.
Let's find Amy.

1021
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:51,717
Go ahead,
if you guys wanna say something.

1022
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,171
Gil, go, go.

1023
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:00,633
Nick, where are you going?

1024
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,261
Stop him!

1025
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:04,507
No questions right now. Thank you.

1026
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:08,550
Why are you running away?

1027
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:11,058
Don't run.

1028
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,140
Everybody, stay back.

1029
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:20,108
Guys, come on. You know better.

1030
00:57:20,148 --> 00:57:22,608
Get off the grass, get down to the curb.

1031
00:57:22,651 --> 00:57:24,071
- Hey, gil...
- On it.

1032
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:25,151
All right.

1033
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:26,985
All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.

1034
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,320
Hello?

1035
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:30,624
Hello?

1036
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:31,489
Fuck.

1037
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,045
You scared me. Want a drink?

1038
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:34,578
Did you know she was pregnant?

1039
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:36,751
I told you,
noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy.

1040
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,830
She doesn't even know Amy.

1041
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,100
They look like pretty good friends
to me.

1042
00:57:47,676 --> 00:57:51,096
Look, I don't know. But it certainly
doesn't prove that she's pregnant.

1043
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:52,348
We have her medical records coming.

1044
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:54,269
- Good.
- So, let's talk while we wait.

1045
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:56,518
Let's start over here.
The scene of the crime.

1046
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,440
You see, we've seen dozens
of home invasions.

1047
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:01,439
Dozens and dozens.

1048
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:03,691
This area right here, it looked wrong
from the second we saw it.

1049
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:06,904
The whole thing looked staged.
Watch this.

1050
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:12,242
And yet, they remained upright
throughout this life-and-death struggle?

1051
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:14,409
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

1052
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:16,083
Did you do any housekeeping
the day your wife went missing?

1053
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:17,121
No.

1054
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:19,372
Because our guys did a luminol test.

1055
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:22,086
And I'm sorry to tell you,
but that kitchen lit up.

1056
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:24,377
Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick.
A lot.

1057
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:25,421
Oh, my God.

1058
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:26,762
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.

1059
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:29,258
Wait a second.
Why would they mop up the blood...

1060
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:30,901
If they're trying to stage
a crime scene?

1061
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:33,678
No blood and no body
suggests kidnapping.

1062
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:36,142
It tells us,
look at people outside the house.

1063
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:37,603
Like these homeless you keep mentioning.

1064
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:40,733
A pool of blood and no body
suggests homicide.

1065
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:42,771
It tells us to look at people
inside the house.

1066
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:45,534
- Which is what we're doing here, Nick.
- I see.

1067
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:48,527
So, how was your marriage, Nick?
Because right now, all we got is noelle.

1068
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,110
She says, "not good."

1069
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:51,655
Gil, what do you and your wife
argue about?

1070
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:53,828
- What pisses you off?
- Money, lack thereof.

1071
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:55,617
Me and my ex, it's the same.

1072
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:59,001
I mention that because
we got a look at your finances, Nick.

1073
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,749
$117,000 in credit card debt.

1074
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:03,752
- What?
- I pulled up some of the merchandise.

1075
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:05,804
There are these fun little splurges.

1076
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:07,378
I didn't buy any of this stuff.

1077
00:59:07,422 --> 00:59:08,552
I don't even golf!

1078
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,920
I do! You bought great clubs.

1079
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,257
I like the robot dog.

1080
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:13,261
This is identity theft!
This is a felony!

1081
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:14,263
We need to find out who did this!

1082
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:16,064
All right.
Let's talk about life insurance.

1083
00:59:16,098 --> 00:59:18,638
Because in April,
you bumped up Amy's life insurance...

1084
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:19,684
To $1.2 million.

1085
00:59:19,726 --> 00:59:22,096
Yes, I did. That was her idea.
She wanted me to.

1086
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:23,305
You filed the paperwork.

1087
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:24,555
Because she told me to!

1088
00:59:25,399 --> 00:59:26,319
Hold on a sec.

1089
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:28,148
Yeah? Okay.

1090
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,240
For sure?

1091
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:32,825
All right.

1092
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:37,910
She was pregnant.

1093
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:43,629
This is insane.

1094
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:46,167
So, my question becomes...

1095
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:49,131
I don't want to talk
to you again, ever...

1096
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:50,343
Without a lawyer.

1097
00:59:58,682 --> 00:59:59,682
Margo!

1098
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:11,569
Hey.

1099
01:00:13,947 --> 01:00:16,367
Just hold on a second. Let me finish.

1100
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:17,328
Nick?

1101
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:20,157
I hear you, I hear you.
I was as surprised as...

1102
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:24,044
I know you're upset.
I had no idea she was pregnant.

1103
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:27,588
Listen, I thought so, too,
but evidently that wasn't...

1104
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:32,218
you want to know the truth?

1105
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:34,627
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.

1106
01:00:37,054 --> 01:00:39,104
Well, I'm as surprised as...

1107
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:42,232
you told me you didn't want kids.

1108
01:00:43,227 --> 01:00:44,627
I was trying to put a good face on.

1109
01:00:44,645 --> 01:00:46,525
Then, suddenly,
you've got a pregnant wife.

1110
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:47,903
That's a problem for you.

1111
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:51,030
Especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend.

1112
01:00:51,068 --> 01:00:52,528
Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott!

1113
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:53,899
You have to fucking talk to me!

1114
01:00:56,573 --> 01:01:00,623
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids
because she didn't want me to.

1115
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:02,871
Because it would have just been
another reason for you to hate her.

1116
01:01:02,913 --> 01:01:04,793
And we had enough of those already!
It was easier to just...

1117
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:07,041
- lie to me?
- I wanted kids!

1118
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:09,254
When we first moved here,
I went to a fertility clinic!

1119
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:10,964
- It didn't work?
- I did my part!

1120
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:12,054
Masturbate.

1121
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:13,799
When it came time for Amy to do her thing,
all of a sudden it was like...

1122
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:15,381
"Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."

1123
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:17,425
Now, who would believe you?

1124
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:19,795
All right.

1125
01:01:29,439 --> 01:01:31,229
This is a letter from the clinic...

1126
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:33,745
Notifying me
that they're gonna destroy my sample...

1127
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:35,777
Unless I contact them.

1128
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,570
So, I gave it to Amy.

1129
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:41,615
The next day, I saw it in the trash.

1130
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,240
But you were already with Andie
by then, right?

1131
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:46,117
I wanted a baby with Amy.

1132
01:01:46,164 --> 01:01:50,344
A year ago, Amy being pregnant
would have been the best thing ever!

1133
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:58,764
"When your poor Amy has a cold,
this dessert just..."

1134
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,182
this is the clue you couldn't solve.

1135
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,350
Yeah.

1136
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:06,426
A letter from desi.
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?

1137
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:08,846
It was the fucking rich guy
who would do anything for her.

1138
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:10,856
It just kept hanging over my head.
It was disgusting.

1139
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:11,898
Your prenup?

1140
01:02:12,232 --> 01:02:15,192
Nick, why have you kept this stuff?
It's like a little box of hate.

1141
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:17,025
I don't know, go! Maybe I hate her!

1142
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:23,027
I love you no matter what.

1143
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:24,446
But you need to tell me.

1144
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:25,914
Tell you what?

1145
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:28,367
What are you asking me?

1146
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:33,128
Are you asking me
if I killed my wife, go?

1147
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:35,667
Is that what you're asking me?
If I murdered my wife?

1148
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:38,134
I would never ask you that!

1149
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:43,095
Margo!

1150
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:58,111
Don't walk on the glass.

1151
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:02,451
You have no clue, do you?

1152
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:21,839
Why was he here that night?

1153
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:26,310
His wife is missing. Why come here?

1154
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:27,348
Who cares?

1155
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:28,808
Rhonda, we got this.

1156
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,351
Let's make the arrest.

1157
01:03:30,394 --> 01:03:32,484
Do you know how hard it is
to make a murder case without a body?

1158
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:33,441
No.

1159
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,650
Well, it's incredibly hard.

1160
01:03:35,691 --> 01:03:38,571
So, I want one last thing.

1161
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:39,610
What's that?

1162
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:43,528
I want a body.

1163
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:49,120
Picture me.
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

1164
01:03:49,162 --> 01:03:50,792
Be careful.

1165
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:59,755
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had."

1166
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:05,303
Fuck.

1167
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:10,104
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

1168
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:13,521
So, open the door...

1169
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:14,942
Punish. Wood. Beach.

1170
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,480
...and look alive.

1171
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:23,201
Punish. Wood.

1172
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:25,954
Wood.

1173
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:00,785
I will practice believing
my husband loves me...

1174
01:05:00,817 --> 01:05:03,237
And will love this baby.

1175
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:07,534
That this child
might really save our marriage.

1176
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:09,868
But I could be wrong.

1177
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,961
Because sometimes...

1178
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:21,171
The way he looks at me...

1179
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:24,006
I think...

1180
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:25,129
Man of my dreams...

1181
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:29,142
Father of my child...

1182
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:33,930
This man of mine may kill me.

1183
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:37,310
He may truly...

1184
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,230
Kill me.

1185
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:42,942
Wtf?

1186
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:10,475
I am so much happier now that I'm dead.

1187
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:17,097
Technically, "missing."

1188
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:19,596
Soon to be presumed dead.

1189
01:06:21,315 --> 01:06:22,445
Gone.

1190
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,650
And my lazy, lying, cheating,
oblivious husband...

1191
01:06:26,695 --> 01:06:29,985
Will go to prison for my murder.

1192
01:06:31,283 --> 01:06:33,833
Nick dunne took my pride
and my dignity...

1193
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:36,369
And my hope and my money.

1194
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:40,003
He took and took from me
until I no longer existed.

1195
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:41,462
That's murder.

1196
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:44,302
Let the punishment fit the crime.

1197
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,880
To fake a convincing murder,
you have to have discipline.

1198
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:55,095
You befriend a local idiot.

1199
01:06:58,644 --> 01:07:01,814
Harvest the details
of her humdrum life.

1200
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:05,779
And cram her with stories
about your husband's violent temper.

1201
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:09,202
Secretly create some money troubles.

1202
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:12,616
Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.

1203
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:17,454
With the help of the unwitting...

1204
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:19,496
Bump up your life insurance.

1205
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:24,378
Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.

1206
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:27,709
Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.

1207
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:32,803
You need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss.

1208
01:07:32,845 --> 01:07:35,815
And America loves pregnant women.

1209
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:39,139
As if it's so hard to spread your legs.

1210
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:40,484
You know what's hard?

1211
01:07:40,978 --> 01:07:42,938
Faking a pregnancy.

1212
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:45,150
First, drain your toilet.

1213
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:49,609
Invite pregnant idiot into your home...

1214
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:52,163
And ply her with lemonade.

1215
01:07:57,327 --> 01:07:59,497
Steal pregnant idiot's urine.

1216
01:08:01,707 --> 01:08:03,207
Voilà.

1217
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:07,210
A pregnancy is now part
of your legal medical record.

1218
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:15,049
Happy anniversary.

1219
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:20,483
Wait for your clueless husband...

1220
01:08:20,517 --> 01:08:22,387
To start his day.

1221
01:08:23,854 --> 01:08:25,314
Off he goes.

1222
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:27,515
And the clock is ticking.

1223
01:08:28,692 --> 01:08:31,192
Meticulously stage your crime scene...

1224
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:35,872
With just enough mistakes
to raise the specter of doubt.

1225
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:39,244
You need to bleed.

1226
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:40,578
A lot.

1227
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:42,875
A lot, a lot.

1228
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:48,040
A head wound kind of bleed.

1229
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:51,212
A crime scene kind of bleed.

1230
01:08:54,218 --> 01:08:56,338
You need to clean poorly...

1231
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:57,386
Like he would.

1232
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:00,596
Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.

1233
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:03,815
And leave a little something behind.

1234
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:06,228
A fire in July?

1235
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:08,863
And because you're you...

1236
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:10,149
You don't stop there.

1237
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:12,777
You need a diary.

1238
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:15,739
Minimum, 300 entries
on the Nick and Amy story.

1239
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:18,696
Start with the fairy tale early days.

1240
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:21,042
Those are true. And they're crucial.

1241
01:09:21,078 --> 01:09:23,078
You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.

1242
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:26,043
After that, you invent.

1243
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:27,083
The spending.

1244
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:28,884
The abuse. The fear.

1245
01:09:28,919 --> 01:09:31,879
The threat of violence.

1246
01:09:31,922 --> 01:09:33,882
And Nick thought he was the writer.

1247
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,881
Burn it just the right amount.

1248
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:39,599
Make sure the cops will find it.

1249
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:47,651
Finally, honor tradition
with a very special treasure hunt.

1250
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:53,032
And if I get everything right,
the world will hate Nick...

1251
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:55,778
For killing his beautiful,
pregnant wife.

1252
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:58,451
And after all the outrage,
when I'm ready...

1253
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,490
I'll go out on the water
with a handful of pills...

1254
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:03,042
And a pocket full of stones.

1255
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:05,868
And when they find my body,
they'll know...

1256
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:09,214
Nick dunne dumped his beloved
like garbage.

1257
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:11,591
And she floated down
past all the other...

1258
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:14,958
Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.

1259
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:18,301
Then, Nick will die, too.

1260
01:10:19,178 --> 01:10:21,048
Nick and Amy will be gone.

1261
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:23,216
But, then, we never really existed.

1262
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:26,485
Nick loved a girl
I was pretending to be.

1263
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:27,518
"Cool girl."

1264
01:10:27,978 --> 01:10:31,818
Men always use that
as their defining compliment.

1265
01:10:31,857 --> 01:10:32,857
"She's a cool girl."

1266
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:35,114
Cool girl is hot.

1267
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:36,572
Cool girl is game.

1268
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:37,612
Cool girl is fun.

1269
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:40,446
Cool girl never gets angry at her man.

1270
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,120
She only smiles in a chagrined,
loving manner...

1271
01:10:43,785 --> 01:10:46,745
And then presents her mouth for fucking.

1272
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:48,788
She likes what he likes.

1273
01:10:48,832 --> 01:10:52,292
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster
who loves fetish manga.

1274
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:56,627
If he likes girls gone wild,
she's a mall babe...

1275
01:10:56,673 --> 01:11:00,473
Who talks football
and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.

1276
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:04,101
When I met Nick dunne,
I knew he wanted cool girl.

1277
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:06,809
And for him, I'll admit,
I was willing to try.

1278
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,850
I wax-stripped my pussy raw.

1279
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,650
I drank canned beer
watching Adam sandler movies.

1280
01:11:12,898 --> 01:11:15,688
I ate cold pizza
and remained a size two.

1281
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:17,694
I blew him semi-regularly.

1282
01:11:19,029 --> 01:11:20,359
I lived in the moment.

1283
01:11:20,656 --> 01:11:23,196
I was fucking game.

1284
01:11:23,825 --> 01:11:25,865
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.

1285
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:30,003
Nick teased out of me
things I didn't know existed.

1286
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,340
A lightness, a humor, an ease.

1287
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:36,297
But I made him smarter. Sharper.

1288
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:39,968
I inspired him to rise to my level.

1289
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:43,758
I forged the man of my dreams.

1290
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:49,018
We were happy pretending
to be other people.

1291
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:50,889
We were the happiest couple we knew.

1292
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:55,521
And what's the point of being together
if you're not the happiest?

1293
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:58,401
But Nick got lazy.

1294
01:11:58,443 --> 01:12:00,653
He became someone
I did not agree to marry.

1295
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:03,866
He actually expected me
to love him unconditionally.

1296
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:09,043
Then he dragged me, penniless,
to the navel of this great country...

1297
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:13,039
And found himself a newer,
younger, bouncier...

1298
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,083
Cool girl.

1299
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:20,590
You think I'd let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever?

1300
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:22,761
No fucking way.

1301
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:24,935
He doesn't get to win.

1302
01:12:35,272 --> 01:12:39,232
My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth,
Missouri guy.

1303
01:12:41,653 --> 01:12:44,113
He needed to learn.

1304
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:47,453
Grown-ups work for things.

1305
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:49,953
Grown-ups pay.

1306
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,920
Grown-ups suffer consequences.

1307
01:12:57,419 --> 01:12:58,629
Wait.

1308
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:01,804
I need 20 seconds where you
don't judge me, interrupt me...

1309
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,470
Or get angry.

1310
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:06,467
Okay.

1311
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:12,392
Is that all the stuff
from the credit cards?

1312
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:15,604
Where do you store goodies
for anniversary five?

1313
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:16,436
Wood.

1314
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,610
- Woodshed.
- Yeah, my woodshed.

1315
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:22,150
That fucking bitch.

1316
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:25,317
- I thought...
- it's all right.

1317
01:13:25,364 --> 01:13:26,824
I would have, too.

1318
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:31,485
What's that present?

1319
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:33,287
I don't know.

1320
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,290
Let's find out.

1321
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,800
"Dear husband, I know you think
you're moving through this world unseen.

1322
01:13:45,843 --> 01:13:47,263
"Don't believe that for a second.

1323
01:13:47,302 --> 01:13:49,583
"I know where you've been,
and I know where you're going."

1324
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:54,848
"For this anniversary,
I've arranged a trip.

1325
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:56,773
"Follow the river, up, up, up.

1326
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:59,522
"Sit back and relax,
because you are done."

1327
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:00,985
What's "up, up river"?

1328
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:03,194
"Up the river." Prison.

1329
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:05,155
Fucking crazy bitch.

1330
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:06,815
That's what this is.

1331
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:09,164
She's framing me for her murder.

1332
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:10,489
You married a complete psychopath.

1333
01:14:10,534 --> 01:14:12,664
The morning of our anniversary...

1334
01:14:12,703 --> 01:14:17,003
I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
I just couldn't do it.

1335
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,500
I couldn't fake it for another year,
another day.

1336
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:20,463
Then what happened?

1337
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:21,802
Before I could say anything, she said...

1338
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:25,217
"I need you to go somewhere
and really think about our marriage."

1339
01:14:25,257 --> 01:14:26,507
She knew I would go to Sawyer beach.

1340
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:27,840
So you'd have no alibi.

1341
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:30,105
She stage-managed me.

1342
01:14:30,387 --> 01:14:34,057
She knew exactly what I would do.
And I fucking did it.

1343
01:14:34,099 --> 01:14:35,639
I went to the beach,
I thought about our marriage.

1344
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,394
I came back
and decided I wanted a divorce.

1345
01:14:37,436 --> 01:14:38,676
And by the time you got home...

1346
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:40,227
she was gone.

1347
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:41,726
You fuck!

1348
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:43,363
She's good.

1349
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:46,359
Part of me was relieved...

1350
01:14:46,403 --> 01:14:48,703
When I thought she was gone.

1351
01:14:53,076 --> 01:14:54,786
Punch and Judy puppets.

1352
01:14:57,789 --> 01:15:00,879
Remember, he beats Judy to death
and kills that baby.

1353
01:15:00,918 --> 01:15:02,038
So I'm punch.

1354
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:05,055
We already knew that, Amy,
what's your point?

1355
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:09,055
Does Missouri have the death penalty?

1356
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:37,373
Hey, neighbor.

1357
01:15:38,288 --> 01:15:40,668
It's been weeks
since I had anyone decent next door.

1358
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:43,921
Well, I don't know how decent I feel.

1359
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:47,091
As long as you don't own a python
and blast death metal at 4 am...

1360
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:49,130
We're gonna be best friends.

1361
01:15:49,174 --> 01:15:51,264
All right. Nice meeting you.

1362
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:52,891
I'm greta.

1363
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:54,802
I'm Nancy.

1364
01:15:54,847 --> 01:15:56,807
Are you going to the marina?
I could use some creamer.

1365
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:58,269
I'm sorry. I can't.

1366
01:15:58,308 --> 01:15:59,518
I've got work to do.

1367
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:01,850
All right. See you around!

1368
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:04,055
You will.

1369
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:55,237
Come on.
Show me that darling Nicky smile.

1370
01:16:57,034 --> 01:16:58,914
You asshole.

1371
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:15,894
Hey.

1372
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,430
Nancy.

1373
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:24,556
Nancy.

1374
01:17:25,562 --> 01:17:27,772
It's hot again today.

1375
01:17:30,067 --> 01:17:31,897
So, where are you from?

1376
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:33,572
Let me guess.

1377
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:37,698
Nebraska.

1378
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:41,120
New Orleans.

1379
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:47,081
You know, I am an expert oiler.

1380
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:48,915
Oh, I just bet you are.

1381
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:51,591
Lotions and balms. Ointment.

1382
01:17:52,297 --> 01:17:54,217
I would hate
for y'all to get tan lines.

1383
01:17:54,258 --> 01:17:56,258
So sweet.

1384
01:17:57,094 --> 01:17:59,764
Okay. You know where I'll be.

1385
01:18:02,641 --> 01:18:05,061
I see we have the same taste in men.

1386
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:09,020
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.

1387
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:12,114
Least you could do
is not keep his secrets for him.

1388
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:14,531
Let me guess.

1389
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:18,450
He's trying to watch the big game
and you just won't shut up.

1390
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,580
No, you don't seem
like much of a talker.

1391
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:22,618
I got it.

1392
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:25,079
You caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank...

1393
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:27,122
And he apologized to you
by busting you a good one.

1394
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:30,501
Worse.

1395
01:18:30,627 --> 01:18:31,627
Worse?

1396
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:36,172
I went to the bar where he works
to surprise him.

1397
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:40,926
And out he comes with this girl
who had no business being in a bar.

1398
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:45,891
On the very first night that we met...

1399
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:50,313
We walked by a bakery
that was having their sugar delivered.

1400
01:18:51,148 --> 01:18:53,528
And it was in the air, everywhere.

1401
01:18:53,567 --> 01:18:55,857
A sugar storm.

1402
01:18:55,903 --> 01:18:58,033
And before he kissed me...

1403
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:00,161
He leaned in...

1404
01:19:01,658 --> 01:19:03,948
And did this.

1405
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:17,090
- And guess what.
- What?

1406
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:18,842
He did the exact same thing with her.

1407
01:19:23,096 --> 01:19:26,096
That is the most disgusting thing
I ever heard.

1408
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:27,851
Thank you.

1409
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:44,196
Thanks very much.

1410
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:53,289
Well, we've gone mainstream.

1411
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:12,022
It's an appeals process,
so we will attempt to appeal to them.

1412
01:20:12,062 --> 01:20:14,192
Mr. bolt. Tanner bolt?

1413
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:17,476
Nick dunne.

1414
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:19,816
I have been sitting by the phone,
my friend.

1415
01:20:23,282 --> 01:20:24,532
I'm sorry.

1416
01:20:24,575 --> 01:20:26,415
Do you not believe me?

1417
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:29,701
No, I believe you. It's just the
craziest thing I've ever heard.

1418
01:20:29,746 --> 01:20:33,076
I love it. But, for you, it sucks.

1419
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:37,092
But you gotta have a grudging respect
for your wife at this point, right?

1420
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:38,709
- Are you laughing me out of the building?
- No!

1421
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:40,505
Are you kidding me? I'm in.

1422
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:42,009
I'm way in.

1423
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:44,680
You came to the right guy.
This is what I do, Nick.

1424
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,140
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.
I win the unwinnable cases.

1425
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:49,852
$100,000?

1426
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:51,432
We'll figure something out.

1427
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:52,516
I'll give you a special...

1428
01:20:52,519 --> 01:20:55,439
"My wife is skilled
in the art of vengeance" rate.

1429
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:56,520
Okay.

1430
01:20:56,565 --> 01:20:58,195
So, what's the plan?

1431
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:00,113
Well, right now,
it's a "he said, she said."

1432
01:21:00,152 --> 01:21:02,612
- She's telling a better story.
- No, Nick.

1433
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:04,494
She is telling the perfect story.

1434
01:21:04,781 --> 01:21:08,081
So, we need to start today
to prepare your defense, should we need it.

1435
01:21:08,118 --> 01:21:10,518
- And if we decide to go with your version of...
- the truth.

1436
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:14,753
Then we'll need to realign
the public's perception of Amy.

1437
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:17,041
Make them stop seeing her
as America's sweetheart...

1438
01:21:17,085 --> 01:21:20,415
And see her for what she is,
which a mind-fucker of the first degree.

1439
01:21:20,839 --> 01:21:24,799
Now, that is a huge realignment.
We'll need other voices besides yours.

1440
01:21:24,843 --> 01:21:27,103
There has to be someone out there
that she's screwed with in the past.

1441
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:30,217
There's a New York guy.
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

1442
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:32,635
Eight years ago,
she pressed charges against him.

1443
01:21:32,684 --> 01:21:34,854
That should be easy to find.

1444
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:38,765
Ex-classmate, desi collings.

1445
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:40,695
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.

1446
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:44,235
You go talk to Tommy,
and I'll draw up the contract.

1447
01:21:48,534 --> 01:21:51,544
I told you, you came to the right guy.

1448
01:21:53,747 --> 01:21:54,957
Apparently.

1449
01:22:04,007 --> 01:22:05,797
Tommy?

1450
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:07,393
Yeah.

1451
01:22:07,803 --> 01:22:09,763
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1452
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,560
You're gonna want a drink.

1453
01:22:15,102 --> 01:22:16,442
Yeah.

1454
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:19,268
So, she said you got physical with her.

1455
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:22,284
No, dude, she said I raped her.

1456
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:24,687
First degree, felony rape.

1457
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:27,155
- Did you do it?
- Did you do it?

1458
01:22:28,323 --> 01:22:30,413
I was looking at 30 years to life.

1459
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:32,491
- Did you get a trial?
- Fuck, no.

1460
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:34,746
Do I look like
I would do well in the yard?

1461
01:22:34,788 --> 01:22:37,708
I pled down, man.
Sexual assault one, no jail time.

1462
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:39,795
- That's something.
- Oh, yeah.

1463
01:22:39,835 --> 01:22:41,255
I've been unemployed
for the last eight years...

1464
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:43,805
Because I have to write "sexual offender"
on every job application.

1465
01:22:43,839 --> 01:22:46,799
I'm on a neighborhood watch list,
because I have to register as a predator.

1466
01:22:46,842 --> 01:22:50,182
I haven't had a date in almost a decade,
because if a girl googles me...

1467
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:54,059
Could you walk me through what happened?

1468
01:22:54,349 --> 01:22:57,479
I meet Amy at this party, you know?

1469
01:22:57,519 --> 01:22:59,149
We click. She's perfect.

1470
01:22:59,188 --> 01:23:01,518
She's beautiful,
she's smart, she's well-read...

1471
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:03,865
She's got an ass
like a 20-year-old stripper.

1472
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:05,691
I think, "what's the catch?"

1473
01:23:05,736 --> 01:23:08,906
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

1474
01:23:09,573 --> 01:23:12,623
Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?

1475
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:16,119
She annexed me.
She made me her business.

1476
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:19,963
It was just too much.
She went out and bought me ties.

1477
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,210
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

1478
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:25,012
Ties. The whole thing just became...

1479
01:23:25,047 --> 01:23:28,837
- so, you broke up with her.
- No, I just backed away.

1480
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:31,684
Gave her some space. No big deal, right?

1481
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,390
So I thought.

1482
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:35,720
Then one night,
Amy comes over to my place...

1483
01:23:35,766 --> 01:23:38,686
With a bottle of bourbon
and a bootleg of this band I love.

1484
01:23:38,727 --> 01:23:41,727
And within two minutes,
she's got my pants around my ankles...

1485
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:43,362
And she is kneeling down, and...

1486
01:23:43,398 --> 01:23:45,398
I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.

1487
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:47,322
- You had sex?
- Yeah, consensual.

1488
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:49,451
It was rough,
but she was screaming for it.

1489
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:52,245
Next morning,
there's two cops at my door.

1490
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:55,494
Amy has wounds
that are consistent with rape.

1491
01:23:55,536 --> 01:23:58,706
Ligature marks on her wrist,
and my semen.

1492
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:02,417
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed,
and raped her.

1493
01:24:02,459 --> 01:24:03,919
Me!

1494
01:24:03,961 --> 01:24:05,711
And then, guess what they find.

1495
01:24:05,754 --> 01:24:07,804
Headboards of my bed, one on each side.

1496
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:09,555
The ties you wouldn't wear.

1497
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:10,931
You do know your wife.

1498
01:24:11,593 --> 01:24:13,433
- Did you ever see her again?
- Yeah.

1499
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:14,890
On TV, last week, with you.

1500
01:24:15,472 --> 01:24:16,892
I thought, "there's Amy.

1501
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:20,942
"She's graduated from being raped
to being murdered."

1502
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:25,943
You been watching this, too?

1503
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:27,193
Last night's bombshell.

1504
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:28,284
We just found out...

1505
01:24:28,318 --> 01:24:31,148
Amy elliott dunne was, indeed,
pregnant when she went missing.

1506
01:24:31,655 --> 01:24:34,625
Kelly capitono,
this makes me wanna throw up.

1507
01:24:34,658 --> 01:24:37,618
What is it about a pregnant woman,
a woman carrying life inside her...

1508
01:24:37,661 --> 01:24:39,121
That turns men into animals?

1509
01:24:39,162 --> 01:24:40,662
Ellen, this is an epidemic.

1510
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:43,206
The third leading cause of death
among pregnant women...

1511
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:45,630
Is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband.

1512
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:48,549
Let's not forget about the wife, ever.

1513
01:24:48,589 --> 01:24:52,629
Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend,
noelle hawthorne.

1514
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:55,046
Thanks for being on the show, noelle.

1515
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:56,385
Thank you, Ellen.

1516
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,930
And let me just say this...

1517
01:24:57,973 --> 01:25:01,563
Amy would have loved you,
and all you do for women.

1518
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:02,642
Oh, that's nice.

1519
01:25:02,686 --> 01:25:04,806
Why don't you tell us
about your friend, noelle?

1520
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:07,405
Amy was so nurturing.

1521
01:25:07,441 --> 01:25:09,821
Oh, I'd love if just once,
someone was like...

1522
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,150
"She was a real rag."

1523
01:25:13,655 --> 01:25:16,235
She was beautiful and smart and kind.

1524
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:18,333
Seems like a rich bitch to me.

1525
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:20,998
What do you mean? People love her.

1526
01:25:21,038 --> 01:25:23,458
I don't know. She seems uppity.

1527
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:27,667
Spoiled rich girl,
married a cheating asshole.

1528
01:25:27,711 --> 01:25:28,921
Paid the ultimate price.

1529
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:32,422
The only secret was her husband.
We never met Nick.

1530
01:25:32,466 --> 01:25:34,086
He never introduced himself.

1531
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:36,514
Why was that, noelle? Why do you think?

1532
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:37,553
I think we know why.

1533
01:25:38,347 --> 01:25:40,597
Because he had a violent temper.

1534
01:25:40,641 --> 01:25:41,681
A little harsh.

1535
01:25:41,725 --> 01:25:43,305
That's life, baby.

1536
01:25:43,352 --> 01:25:44,912
He knew I'd have
seen right through him.

1537
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:47,194
Don't get me wrong.

1538
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:49,111
I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.

1539
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:52,569
I'm just saying, there are consequences.

1540
01:25:54,696 --> 01:25:55,696
Fuck, yeah.

1541
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:58,159
She was so alone.

1542
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,120
And she was so innocent.

1543
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:03,620
You're a good friend, noelle.
And you're a good friend of the show.

1544
01:26:03,664 --> 01:26:04,874
Thanks for coming on.

1545
01:26:04,915 --> 01:26:06,375
Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt.

1546
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:08,706
Tanner bolt landed me.

1547
01:26:08,752 --> 01:26:12,052
I'm gonna try and see desi collings
on my way home.

1548
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:14,049
And, go...

1549
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:17,261
Tanner's retainer is $100,000.

1550
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:19,179
That's just the retainer.

1551
01:26:19,555 --> 01:26:23,185
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.
I've got $2,500 in an ira.

1552
01:26:23,225 --> 01:26:26,315
I'm approved for a second mortgage
on the house. We will go from there.

1553
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:28,103
Thank you.

1554
01:26:28,856 --> 01:26:30,516
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1555
01:26:30,566 --> 01:26:33,316
Nick keeps his father,
who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.

1556
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,570
Number of times he visited last year?
One.

1557
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:36,612
Oh, fuck!

1558
01:26:36,613 --> 01:26:39,323
His twin sister, margo,
well, she is a peach.

1559
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:41,696
These two spend their days
in the bar Amy bought them.

1560
01:26:42,286 --> 01:26:44,406
Playing what, Lauren? Playing house?

1561
01:26:44,454 --> 01:26:45,584
What the fuck?

1562
01:26:45,622 --> 01:26:48,292
Twin siblings often enable and abet.

1563
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:50,632
While I never examined Nick,
or his sister...

1564
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,550
They both seem very, very close.

1565
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:55,131
It's twin-cest.

1566
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:58,175
Disturbingly close, Lauren.

1567
01:26:58,218 --> 01:27:00,218
And so, we close with a question.

1568
01:27:00,262 --> 01:27:01,762
What kind of moral rot...

1569
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:06,515
Allows a beautiful, talented,
kind, smart, loving mother...

1570
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,270
To vanish without
the heavens hearing our outraged cries?

1571
01:27:10,314 --> 01:27:11,364
Can I bum a cigarette?

1572
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:15,148
Amy elliott dunne, we care about you,
and we will not forget.

1573
01:27:15,652 --> 01:27:17,862
And you know what else we won't forget?

1574
01:27:17,905 --> 01:27:20,285
Missouri has the death penalty.

1575
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:21,494
Amen.

1576
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:49,641
I'd like to report
some strange activity...

1577
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:53,186
Near the woodshed
on the property of one margo dunne.

1578
01:28:34,398 --> 01:28:35,858
Hey.

1579
01:28:41,405 --> 01:28:43,535
- Mr. dunne.
- Mr. collings.

1580
01:28:44,533 --> 01:28:47,623
I know you.
I saw you at the volunteer center.

1581
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:49,371
I wanted to help.

1582
01:28:50,163 --> 01:28:51,873
I hope you don't mind me coming by.

1583
01:28:51,915 --> 01:28:54,995
I got your address from this letter
that you wrote my wife.

1584
01:28:55,878 --> 01:28:59,378
Amy and I believe
in the lost art of letter-writing.

1585
01:28:59,423 --> 01:29:03,263
I always wondered
why you kept in touch after...

1586
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:05,217
Everything.

1587
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:07,682
You were together for two years
in boarding school, right?

1588
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:09,893
She was my first serious girlfriend.

1589
01:29:09,933 --> 01:29:12,733
- Why did you break up?
- That's a strange question.

1590
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:14,729
Did you treat her bad?
Did you cheat on her?

1591
01:29:14,771 --> 01:29:15,981
That's a rude question.

1592
01:29:16,023 --> 01:29:17,733
Let me tell you what Amy told me.

1593
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:20,744
She dumped you,
you completely unraveled.

1594
01:29:20,777 --> 01:29:22,857
You stalked her, you threatened her...

1595
01:29:22,905 --> 01:29:26,415
And you attempted suicide in her bed
and were institutionalized.

1596
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:30,370
Your wife is missing,
and you came all this way to tell me this?

1597
01:29:30,412 --> 01:29:32,622
I thought there might be
another side to this story.

1598
01:29:36,293 --> 01:29:38,133
Mr. collings.

1599
01:29:40,214 --> 01:29:42,134
Fuck.

1600
01:29:47,763 --> 01:29:50,773
...the missing persons case
of Amy elliott dunne.

1601
01:29:50,807 --> 01:29:54,477
She is the beautiful blonde inspiration
for the amazing Amy kids' book series.

1602
01:30:11,662 --> 01:30:13,872
You're reading that diary again?

1603
01:30:13,914 --> 01:30:14,964
You know how it ends.

1604
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:17,458
It interests me.

1605
01:30:17,501 --> 01:30:19,091
Hey, Rhonda.

1606
01:30:19,127 --> 01:30:21,047
"He's gonna kill me." The end.

1607
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:23,208
Why did he go to his dad's house
to burn it?

1608
01:30:23,257 --> 01:30:24,377
It's private. There's no one there.

1609
01:30:24,424 --> 01:30:27,224
Why didn't he make sure
it actually burned?

1610
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:30,221
Because he tripped the alarm.
You were up his ass with a flashlight.

1611
01:30:30,264 --> 01:30:32,604
The whole thing just feels hinky.

1612
01:30:32,641 --> 01:30:34,731
Like finding an envelope marked "clue."

1613
01:30:34,768 --> 01:30:35,888
You ever hear the expression...

1614
01:30:35,936 --> 01:30:37,776
"The simplest answer
is often the correct one"?

1615
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,480
Actually, I've never
found that to be true.

1616
01:30:40,524 --> 01:30:42,324
- Good night.
- Good night.

1617
01:30:44,987 --> 01:30:45,987
Hey.

1618
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:57,325
Elvis is in Missouri.

1619
01:30:57,374 --> 01:30:59,504
Thank God. Come on in.

1620
01:30:59,543 --> 01:31:02,423
First thing you have to understand
about Amy, she loves to teach lessons.

1621
01:31:02,546 --> 01:31:05,006
- Play God.
- Yeah, old testament God.

1622
01:31:05,048 --> 01:31:06,088
Okay. Keep talking.

1623
01:31:06,133 --> 01:31:07,843
She finds out I've been cheating on her
with Andie...

1624
01:31:07,885 --> 01:31:09,475
Decides to teach me a lesson.

1625
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:11,431
Fakes her own death, frames me for it.

1626
01:31:11,471 --> 01:31:13,681
Blood in the house, credit cards,
life insurance.

1627
01:31:13,724 --> 01:31:14,934
She does the treasure hunt.

1628
01:31:14,975 --> 01:31:16,315
Now, the treasure hunt is critical.

1629
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:20,021
She's taking us on a tour of my
infidelities. Rubbing my nose in it.

1630
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:22,113
And she leaves clue number one
for the police...

1631
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:23,859
Which will lead them
back to my office...

1632
01:31:23,901 --> 01:31:26,441
Which is a place
where Andie and I would often...

1633
01:31:26,486 --> 01:31:27,816
And she leaves a pair of red panties.

1634
01:31:27,863 --> 01:31:29,033
Right. Racy, looks bad.

1635
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:30,782
- Clue two.
- My father's house.

1636
01:31:30,824 --> 01:31:33,204
Another place where Andie and I
would occasionally have relations.

1637
01:31:33,243 --> 01:31:34,623
- Clue three?
- Woodshed.

1638
01:31:34,661 --> 01:31:36,161
- Also a location...
- Oh, my God.

1639
01:31:36,205 --> 01:31:37,965
- We had limited options.
- A hotel.

1640
01:31:37,998 --> 01:31:40,498
- Amy would have seen the credit card bill.
- Put it on Andie's credit card.

1641
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:41,882
Andie's statement
went right to her parents.

1642
01:31:41,919 --> 01:31:44,459
Nick, margo, can we head over
to the little brown house?

1643
01:31:44,505 --> 01:31:46,305
- This leads us to what?
- My dad's house.

1644
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:48,090
Dad's house is blue.

1645
01:31:49,384 --> 01:31:52,434
After the divorce,
when dad wasn't coming around...

1646
01:31:52,763 --> 01:31:57,023
I used to pretend that he was a spy
named Mr. brown, who...

1647
01:31:57,059 --> 01:32:00,729
For the sake of his children's safety,
had to deny their existence.

1648
01:32:00,771 --> 01:32:02,191
You never told me that.

1649
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:04,229
You told her that?

1650
01:32:04,274 --> 01:32:06,574
We've got incriminating red panties
in your office.

1651
01:32:06,902 --> 01:32:09,302
We've got a showcase showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed.

1652
01:32:10,405 --> 01:32:13,735
So, what in God's name
is at your father's house, Nick?

1653
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:14,874
And be honest.

1654
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:16,750
I honestly have no idea.

1655
01:32:23,919 --> 01:32:27,629
Whatever they found, I think it's
safe to assume that it's very bad.

1656
01:32:29,466 --> 01:32:31,716
We got a lot of uncontained issues here.

1657
01:32:31,969 --> 01:32:35,059
Nick, do you have any idea
as to what Andie's mindset is?

1658
01:32:36,265 --> 01:32:38,065
We haven't communicated since the vigil.

1659
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,430
Okay. Amy's parents?

1660
01:32:39,476 --> 01:32:41,056
- No, it's...
- More pressure.

1661
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:44,363
We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will
no doubt go public at any moment.

1662
01:32:44,398 --> 01:32:45,898
- No, Andie won't do that.
- She will.

1663
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:47,651
They always do.
Don't take it personally.

1664
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:50,321
Amy's got us in an interesting bind.

1665
01:32:50,654 --> 01:32:52,954
- We need to tell the cops about Andie.
- Really?

1666
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:55,160
Right now,
Andie just gives you another motive.

1667
01:32:55,993 --> 01:32:57,163
We need to tell the cops
about the woodshed.

1668
01:32:57,452 --> 01:32:58,872
We need to be on the front end of that.

1669
01:32:58,912 --> 01:33:01,252
But I'm gonna warn you
as to what will happen.

1670
01:33:01,832 --> 01:33:03,042
They'll go after margo.

1671
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:04,083
They can't do that, can they?

1672
01:33:04,126 --> 01:33:06,036
She's your accomplice.
She helped you hide the evidence.

1673
01:33:06,086 --> 01:33:08,166
In all likelihood,
she knows that you killed Amy.

1674
01:33:09,089 --> 01:33:10,509
God.

1675
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:12,931
Well, what are we going to do?

1676
01:33:12,968 --> 01:33:13,968
We find Amy.

1677
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:16,601
No. Any other strategy
is missing the point.

1678
01:33:16,638 --> 01:33:18,968
I've got two ex-secret service guys
that are really good.

1679
01:33:19,016 --> 01:33:20,636
I'll put them on it.

1680
01:33:20,684 --> 01:33:22,104
But where do they start, Nick?

1681
01:33:22,477 --> 01:33:23,597
Where would Amy go?

1682
01:33:25,772 --> 01:33:27,402
I have no idea.

1683
01:33:31,862 --> 01:33:34,492
Are we keeping score?

1684
01:33:35,157 --> 01:33:36,527
Hey!

1685
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,330
I thought we were steering clear
of men for a while.

1686
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:42,371
He's nice.

1687
01:33:42,372 --> 01:33:44,872
Because he wants to fuck you.

1688
01:33:46,502 --> 01:33:48,042
She's still moping about her ex?

1689
01:33:49,838 --> 01:33:52,508
He got cheated on, too.

1690
01:33:55,886 --> 01:33:58,756
We three are the
saddest sacks in all the ozarks.

1691
01:33:58,805 --> 01:34:00,345
I'm not sad.

1692
01:34:00,891 --> 01:34:01,891
I'm angry.

1693
01:34:01,892 --> 01:34:03,692
There you go.

1694
01:34:03,727 --> 01:34:06,347
I almost drank myself to death
when my wife left me.

1695
01:34:06,396 --> 01:34:08,646
I was gonna kill myself.
Can you believe that?

1696
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:09,820
Don't give him the pleasure.

1697
01:34:09,858 --> 01:34:12,988
I was going to drown myself
in the Gulf of Mexico...

1698
01:34:13,028 --> 01:34:15,528
Let myself be dinner
for the great whites.

1699
01:34:15,572 --> 01:34:17,372
Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins.

1700
01:34:17,407 --> 01:34:21,327
Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.

1701
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:23,830
Please put that on a t-shirt.

1702
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:34,761
Miss moneybags.
I thought you said you were broke.

1703
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:37,550
That's a fat wad.

1704
01:34:39,346 --> 01:34:41,136
It's mostly singles.

1705
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:43,061
Singles? What are you, a stripper?

1706
01:34:43,851 --> 01:34:46,441
Swamp girls, or treasure chest?

1707
01:34:47,563 --> 01:34:48,613
We're just teasing.

1708
01:34:49,398 --> 01:34:51,188
Don't they tease people down in nola?

1709
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:56,570
We can expect Nick dunne's arrest
any day now.

1710
01:34:56,613 --> 01:35:00,333
We've got blood in the house,
huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.

1711
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:04,327
And we have Amy elliott dunne,
missing for five days...

1712
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:06,501
Crying out for justice.

1713
01:35:07,291 --> 01:35:09,001
We'll be right back.

1714
01:36:01,261 --> 01:36:03,851
Tanner has a very bad idea
he's going to pitch you.

1715
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:04,679
Yeah?

1716
01:36:04,723 --> 01:36:06,313
You're doing Sharon schieber
tomorrow in St. Louis.

1717
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:07,350
It could go so wrong.

1718
01:36:07,392 --> 01:36:09,142
And you are going
to tell her about Andie.

1719
01:36:09,186 --> 01:36:10,476
Nope.

1720
01:36:10,521 --> 01:36:12,521
That sounds like a very bad idea.

1721
01:36:12,564 --> 01:36:14,654
You haven't heard from her
in three days.

1722
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:18,401
This is a ticking time bomb.
You've gotta throw yourself on it.

1723
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:20,985
- People are gonna hate me.
- And then, they will forgive you.

1724
01:36:21,031 --> 01:36:23,491
A guy admitting that he's a
gigantic asshole on television?

1725
01:36:23,534 --> 01:36:25,204
People empathize with that.

1726
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,540
- Why don't we just put out a statement?
- They need to see you.

1727
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,670
Sharon's specials,
they get 10 million viewers.

1728
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:34,208
She is a crusader.
If she takes you on as a cause...

1729
01:36:34,253 --> 01:36:36,173
she's going to ask real questions.

1730
01:36:36,213 --> 01:36:38,053
I will drill you
as if you were doing a deposition.

1731
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:39,550
What to say, what not to say.

1732
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:40,721
A trained monkey?

1733
01:36:40,759 --> 01:36:42,879
A trained monkey
who doesn't get the lethal injection.

1734
01:36:44,137 --> 01:36:47,597
Nick, this case
is about what people think of you.

1735
01:36:47,641 --> 01:36:49,391
They need to like you.

1736
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:53,274
Now, you do this and you will reach
millions of those people.

1737
01:36:54,439 --> 01:36:56,939
Maybe I only need to reach one.

1738
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:07,200
Hello?

1739
01:37:07,244 --> 01:37:08,454
Hey, baby.

1740
01:37:09,913 --> 01:37:11,503
One minute.

1741
01:37:20,257 --> 01:37:21,717
- Hey.
- Hey.

1742
01:37:21,758 --> 01:37:22,758
You clearing out?

1743
01:37:22,759 --> 01:37:24,589
No, I'm just cleaning up.

1744
01:37:24,636 --> 01:37:26,216
Let us come in and say goodbye.

1745
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:27,313
I'll come by before...

1746
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:29,097
let us give you a hand.

1747
01:37:35,272 --> 01:37:37,732
Yeah, you gotta
clear everything out, here.

1748
01:37:39,401 --> 01:37:42,111
Dorothy is a real stickler.

1749
01:37:43,447 --> 01:37:46,737
Not even a spare hanger
can you leave behind.

1750
01:37:49,328 --> 01:37:50,928
Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.

1751
01:37:53,415 --> 01:37:54,415
A sock...

1752
01:37:55,334 --> 01:37:58,134
Or undies or what have you.

1753
01:38:02,966 --> 01:38:04,296
You did a real good job.

1754
01:38:06,303 --> 01:38:08,433
Where is the money, sweetheart?

1755
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,100
Look under her dress.

1756
01:38:14,645 --> 01:38:15,905
He talked you into this?

1757
01:38:15,938 --> 01:38:17,268
I talked him into it.

1758
01:38:17,314 --> 01:38:19,324
The second you leave,
I'm calling the cops.

1759
01:38:19,816 --> 01:38:23,486
Your glasses are fake.
Your hair's dyed all hamster.

1760
01:38:23,529 --> 01:38:26,609
You say your name's Nancy, but you
don't even answer to it half the time.

1761
01:38:26,657 --> 01:38:29,117
You're hiding. I don't know why,
and I don't really care.

1762
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:31,199
But you ain't gonna call the cops.

1763
01:38:31,537 --> 01:38:33,617
And I don't think you've
ever really been hit before.

1764
01:38:39,837 --> 01:38:41,837
Holy shit.

1765
01:38:44,883 --> 01:38:47,683
Sorry, but we really need the money.

1766
01:38:47,719 --> 01:38:49,349
Next place, be more careful, okay?

1767
01:38:49,388 --> 01:38:51,748
There are a lot of people out there
a lot worse than we are.

1768
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:27,971
Excuse me. You can't sleep here.

1769
01:39:55,579 --> 01:39:58,669
I did not kill my wife.

1770
01:39:59,666 --> 01:40:02,956
Why don't you try it again?
A little less wooden.

1771
01:40:03,003 --> 01:40:04,093
I didn't kill my wife.

1772
01:40:05,923 --> 01:40:07,633
- What are you doing?
- Every time you look smug...

1773
01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:10,344
Or annoyed or tense,
I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.

1774
01:40:10,385 --> 01:40:12,345
- That's supposed to make me less tense?
- Let's try it again.

1775
01:40:12,387 --> 01:40:15,677
Mr. dunne, from what I understand,
you and your wife had some bumps.

1776
01:40:16,725 --> 01:40:20,685
Yeah, we had some tough years.
I lost my job.

1777
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:21,729
You both did.

1778
01:40:24,441 --> 01:40:26,321
We both lost our jobs.

1779
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,900
I had to move back home
so we could take care of my mother...

1780
01:40:28,946 --> 01:40:31,486
Who was dying of cancer
and my dad, who had...

1781
01:40:31,532 --> 01:40:33,282
your dad's scorched earth.

1782
01:40:33,325 --> 01:40:34,995
Let's talk about your mom,
how close you were.

1783
01:40:35,035 --> 01:40:36,195
Go on.

1784
01:40:36,245 --> 01:40:38,755
For a while,
things had been building up.

1785
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:42,289
"Built up" implies that an explosion
is coming. No.

1786
01:40:42,334 --> 01:40:44,754
At a certain point,
we got on the wrong track.

1787
01:40:45,587 --> 01:40:47,207
I had a moment of weakness.

1788
01:40:47,256 --> 01:40:49,666
Your "moment" was over 15 months.

1789
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:55,560
I disrespected my wife.

1790
01:40:56,223 --> 01:40:58,643
And I disrespected my marriage.

1791
01:40:59,101 --> 01:41:00,481
And I'll always regret it.

1792
01:41:01,228 --> 01:41:02,058
That works.

1793
01:41:02,104 --> 01:41:04,524
Don't be afraid to play up
the dufus husband thing, Nick.

1794
01:41:04,565 --> 01:41:06,275
"I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.

1795
01:41:06,316 --> 01:41:07,146
"Everything I do is wrong."

1796
01:41:07,192 --> 01:41:09,242
I know.
What men are supposed to do in general.

1797
01:41:11,363 --> 01:41:12,413
- Thank you.
- How do you feel?

1798
01:41:12,447 --> 01:41:15,657
I feel good.
Go, can you pass me that box, please?

1799
01:41:16,076 --> 01:41:18,696
It's Amy's 33rd birthday present
to me.

1800
01:41:18,745 --> 01:41:19,745
You hate that watch.

1801
01:41:19,788 --> 01:41:21,868
No, go. I love that watch.

1802
01:41:21,915 --> 01:41:23,915
Just like I love this tie.

1803
01:41:23,959 --> 01:41:27,089
Just like I love my wife.

1804
01:41:57,451 --> 01:41:58,831
It's you!

1805
01:41:58,869 --> 01:42:00,869
It's you.

1806
01:42:01,705 --> 01:42:03,705
I'm sorry.

1807
01:42:04,374 --> 01:42:05,714
I'm sorry.

1808
01:42:06,627 --> 01:42:08,627
Good God.

1809
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:10,050
Last week...

1810
01:42:10,547 --> 01:42:15,717
I threatened to leave, and he said
he'd find me and he'd kill me.

1811
01:42:16,053 --> 01:42:18,223
So, I disappeared.

1812
01:42:19,389 --> 01:42:21,219
I lost the baby.

1813
01:42:21,725 --> 01:42:23,515
I couldn't even tell my parents.

1814
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:27,480
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.

1815
01:42:28,232 --> 01:42:29,402
Well, he is looking for you.

1816
01:42:30,067 --> 01:42:32,027
He showed up on my doorstep
three days ago.

1817
01:42:32,069 --> 01:42:34,569
He tracked me from my letters to you.

1818
01:42:35,697 --> 01:42:36,907
You saved them.

1819
01:42:37,491 --> 01:42:38,531
Knowing you were out there...

1820
01:42:38,575 --> 01:42:41,195
Was the only thing that's kept me going
these past few years.

1821
01:42:41,245 --> 01:42:42,625
Let's go to the police.
You can explain everything.

1822
01:42:42,663 --> 01:42:43,963
No, I can't turn up now.

1823
01:42:43,997 --> 01:42:47,077
I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.

1824
01:42:48,919 --> 01:42:51,209
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?

1825
01:42:51,255 --> 01:42:53,095
He should go to prison
for what he's done.

1826
01:42:55,926 --> 01:42:58,386
I'm setting you up at my lake house.

1827
01:42:58,428 --> 01:42:59,428
It's utterly secluded.

1828
01:43:00,848 --> 01:43:02,678
Why are you so good to me?

1829
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:04,064
You know why.

1830
01:43:04,101 --> 01:43:05,231
Excuse me.

1831
01:43:05,269 --> 01:43:06,389
I know you, don't I?

1832
01:43:06,436 --> 01:43:07,226
No.

1833
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:09,231
You're one of the nolan girls, right?

1834
01:43:09,273 --> 01:43:12,153
No, we're from winnipeg. Excuse us.

1835
01:43:12,192 --> 01:43:13,072
We should leave.

1836
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:14,190
Just a second.

1837
01:43:14,778 --> 01:43:18,028
That was boney. I'll call her later.

1838
01:43:18,073 --> 01:43:19,953
Tanner. Nice to see you.

1839
01:43:20,242 --> 01:43:21,372
Sharon! Hi.

1840
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:23,080
Hope this is worth my while.

1841
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:24,250
You're gonna be very happy.

1842
01:43:24,705 --> 01:43:25,505
Sharon.

1843
01:43:25,539 --> 01:43:27,749
Ms. schieber.
Thank you so much for doing this.

1844
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:29,921
Can I get you anything to drink or eat
before we get started?

1845
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:31,960
No, I had some gummy bears.

1846
01:43:33,046 --> 01:43:34,626
What the fuck?

1847
01:43:35,799 --> 01:43:36,929
I'm sorry?

1848
01:43:37,342 --> 01:43:41,222
We have a major shocking development
in the amazing Amy disappearance.

1849
01:43:41,263 --> 01:43:42,643
We go live to that story now.

1850
01:43:42,681 --> 01:43:43,971
Oh, my God.

1851
01:43:46,143 --> 01:43:47,943
You little slut.

1852
01:43:47,978 --> 01:43:50,978
My name is Andie Fitzgerald.

1853
01:43:51,982 --> 01:43:53,652
I met Nicholas dunne...

1854
01:43:53,692 --> 01:43:57,322
When he was my creative writing teacher
at mill valley.

1855
01:43:57,362 --> 01:43:59,452
Why is she dressed like a babysitter?

1856
01:43:59,489 --> 01:44:00,949
I am deeply ashamed...

1857
01:44:00,991 --> 01:44:04,121
Of having been romantically involved
with a married man.

1858
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:06,081
The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.

1859
01:44:06,121 --> 01:44:08,121
I truly believed we were in love.

1860
01:44:08,165 --> 01:44:10,005
Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite.

1861
01:44:11,502 --> 01:44:12,962
I know that is no excuse.

1862
01:44:13,003 --> 01:44:14,303
No, it is not.

1863
01:44:14,338 --> 01:44:18,678
I do not, in my heart, believe
Nick dunne would have killed for me.

1864
01:44:18,717 --> 01:44:21,137
My prayers go out to everyone
who loves Amy.

1865
01:44:21,178 --> 01:44:24,178
I apologize for the pain
this has caused them.

1866
01:44:29,394 --> 01:44:31,354
We have loved Nick dunne like a son.

1867
01:44:32,189 --> 01:44:33,569
That love ended today.

1868
01:44:33,857 --> 01:44:35,477
Come on, you're staring at ghosts.

1869
01:44:35,526 --> 01:44:38,186
He met our trust with lie after lie.

1870
01:44:38,529 --> 01:44:40,449
We now absolutely believe...

1871
01:44:40,489 --> 01:44:42,869
Nick is involved in the disappearance
of our daughter.

1872
01:44:42,908 --> 01:44:45,158
Our amazing Amy.

1873
01:44:46,036 --> 01:44:48,156
This just got very exciting.

1874
01:44:48,872 --> 01:44:50,582
We need a moment.

1875
01:44:52,584 --> 01:44:54,344
We're gonna have to bow out of this.

1876
01:44:54,378 --> 01:44:56,178
- Nothing has changed.
- Everything has changed.

1877
01:44:56,213 --> 01:44:58,633
An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?

1878
01:44:58,674 --> 01:45:00,314
- I can handle this.
- We're on the defense.

1879
01:45:00,342 --> 01:45:02,392
This is a completely different dynamic.

1880
01:45:02,427 --> 01:45:05,177
- I can handle it.
- She's going to eat you alive.

1881
01:45:05,722 --> 01:45:07,392
Just trust me.

1882
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:13,150
Okay.

1883
01:45:13,188 --> 01:45:14,268
Great.

1884
01:45:15,107 --> 01:45:16,567
Mic him.

1885
01:45:36,295 --> 01:45:38,095
One, two, three, four, five.

1886
01:45:44,428 --> 01:45:45,428
Thank you.

1887
01:45:46,597 --> 01:45:47,887
He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.

1888
01:45:47,931 --> 01:45:48,931
Yeah, no kidding.

1889
01:45:53,604 --> 01:45:56,734
Roll tape. Five... four...

1890
01:45:56,773 --> 01:45:58,403
Three... two...

1891
01:46:00,611 --> 01:46:03,531
Seriously, I can't believe
how fucking good you were.

1892
01:46:03,572 --> 01:46:05,032
- Amy brings out the best in me.
- Don't.

1893
01:46:05,073 --> 01:46:08,243
Keep it together, you two.
At least for the next 24 hours.

1894
01:46:08,285 --> 01:46:10,705
People still hate you.
Women want to scratch your eyes out.

1895
01:46:10,746 --> 01:46:12,616
Andie was really good TV.

1896
01:46:12,664 --> 01:46:14,714
- She's a good person.
- Therein lies the problem.

1897
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:15,750
Ride this out...

1898
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:18,802
And when Sharon airs tomorrow,
we'll be looking at a whole new you.

1899
01:46:18,837 --> 01:46:20,417
But, until then...

1900
01:46:20,464 --> 01:46:22,424
Don't show your face.

1901
01:46:22,466 --> 01:46:24,296
No problem.

1902
01:46:40,609 --> 01:46:41,989
Welcome.

1903
01:46:43,987 --> 01:46:45,817
Make yourself at home.

1904
01:46:45,864 --> 01:46:49,834
I've got music, satellite...

1905
01:46:49,868 --> 01:46:50,868
Netflix.

1906
01:46:50,869 --> 01:46:51,949
He was her teacher!

1907
01:46:51,995 --> 01:46:52,995
Roku.

1908
01:46:53,539 --> 01:46:56,039
Internet, obviously.

1909
01:46:56,625 --> 01:46:59,345
Here is a supposedly grown man...

1910
01:46:59,378 --> 01:47:03,168
if there is ever anything you have
a taste for and you can't find it...

1911
01:47:03,215 --> 01:47:05,475
Just let me know
and I will get it for you.

1912
01:47:05,509 --> 01:47:08,639
Instead of the a-b-c's,
he taught her the birds and the bees.

1913
01:47:08,679 --> 01:47:11,599
And just think how her mother must feel
at a time like this.

1914
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,640
Wine cellar's downstairs.

1915
01:47:17,104 --> 01:47:18,484
I'll get you some clothes, too.

1916
01:47:18,522 --> 01:47:21,942
Not that I don't appreciate
bait shop chic.

1917
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:25,610
The floors are heated,
just dial to your liking.

1918
01:47:25,654 --> 01:47:28,824
There's robes and towels.
The shower has steam.

1919
01:47:28,866 --> 01:47:31,196
The bathtub has a massage cycle.

1920
01:47:33,036 --> 01:47:35,076
There's a great view,
if you're in the mood.

1921
01:47:35,122 --> 01:47:36,662
Blackout curtains if you're not.

1922
01:47:36,707 --> 01:47:39,167
The bed is savoir.

1923
01:47:39,209 --> 01:47:41,459
You'll never get a better sleep.

1924
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:47,680
This is just what I need.

1925
01:47:49,136 --> 01:47:51,046
I'm so exhausted.

1926
01:47:52,556 --> 01:47:54,716
I'll leave you to it, then.

1927
01:47:56,476 --> 01:47:59,226
Amy, I am so happy that you are here.

1928
01:48:00,230 --> 01:48:03,360
And I don't want you to worry
for one moment.

1929
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,360
There are cameras everywhere.

1930
01:48:05,402 --> 01:48:08,282
The exterior, all along the grounds,
the entryway.

1931
01:48:08,322 --> 01:48:09,322
Anyone...

1932
01:48:09,489 --> 01:48:11,739
Who is caught coming or going...

1933
01:48:14,995 --> 01:48:16,585
Will be recorded.

1934
01:48:18,165 --> 01:48:20,885
You are more than safe.

1935
01:48:22,836 --> 01:48:26,336
And I am not letting you get away again.

1936
01:49:12,094 --> 01:49:13,684
- Good morning!
- Don't do that!

1937
01:49:15,430 --> 01:49:16,560
I'm sorry.

1938
01:49:18,559 --> 01:49:20,059
I need to feel safe.

1939
01:49:20,394 --> 01:49:23,404
You are very safe.

1940
01:49:25,607 --> 01:49:27,227
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

1941
01:49:27,276 --> 01:49:29,986
Amy, I'm not Nick.

1942
01:49:30,028 --> 01:49:32,028
It's hard for me.

1943
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:38,580
After so many years
under someone's thumb...

1944
01:49:40,831 --> 01:49:42,151
I know just what that feels like.

1945
01:49:43,041 --> 01:49:45,041
You were never under my thumb.

1946
01:49:45,627 --> 01:49:47,667
- On your leash.
- Never.

1947
01:49:47,713 --> 01:49:49,213
A new start.

1948
01:49:50,507 --> 01:49:52,127
Decent clothes.

1949
01:49:53,051 --> 01:49:55,301
Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.

1950
01:49:55,596 --> 01:49:57,096
There's a gym overlooking the lake.

1951
01:49:57,472 --> 01:50:01,022
The sooner you look like yourself,
the sooner you'll feel like yourself.

1952
01:50:01,059 --> 01:50:04,189
I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch
Sharon schieber, and finally move on.

1953
01:50:04,229 --> 01:50:06,769
I think that's something
I should watch on my own.

1954
01:50:07,191 --> 01:50:08,901
Nonsense.

1955
01:50:12,529 --> 01:50:13,949
I'll be back.

1956
01:50:15,574 --> 01:50:17,744
And I am looking forward...

1957
01:50:17,784 --> 01:50:20,704
To my reunion with Amy elliott.

1958
01:50:43,894 --> 01:50:45,064
Great.

1959
01:50:46,104 --> 01:50:48,194
Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber.

1960
01:50:48,232 --> 01:50:49,862
- Tonight, exclusively...
- Hurry up.

1961
01:50:50,776 --> 01:50:55,156
A husband breaks his silence,
not just on his wife's disappearance...

1962
01:50:55,197 --> 01:50:58,987
But on his infidelity,
and all those shocking rumors.

1963
01:51:01,453 --> 01:51:03,003
Nick dunne...

1964
01:51:03,038 --> 01:51:06,538
You're probably the most hated man
in America right now.

1965
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:09,173
I probably am.
And I probably deserve it.

1966
01:51:09,211 --> 01:51:10,801
I bought that tie.

1967
01:51:10,838 --> 01:51:12,878
Did you kill your wife, Nick?

1968
01:51:12,923 --> 01:51:16,013
I did not kill my wife.

1969
01:51:16,677 --> 01:51:18,217
I am not a murderer.

1970
01:51:18,262 --> 01:51:20,182
But you were unfaithful.

1971
01:51:20,222 --> 01:51:22,432
I was unfaithful.

1972
01:51:22,474 --> 01:51:24,144
And I am deeply ashamed.

1973
01:51:24,184 --> 01:51:26,524
And, on top of that,
you allowed Amy's parents...

1974
01:51:26,812 --> 01:51:29,562
Her friends,
all the people in your hometown...

1975
01:51:29,606 --> 01:51:34,526
Believe you were a loving husband,
desperate to find his missing wife.

1976
01:51:34,570 --> 01:51:36,450
Well, I am desperate
to find my missing wife.

1977
01:51:36,488 --> 01:51:39,488
You say that, but I'm wondering
how you expect us to believe you...

1978
01:51:39,533 --> 01:51:41,243
Now that we know you're a liar.

1979
01:51:41,535 --> 01:51:44,665
I didn't come forward with my affair...

1980
01:51:44,705 --> 01:51:47,875
Because I knew it would make me look
really, really bad.

1981
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:50,499
But I don't care about that anymore.

1982
01:51:50,544 --> 01:51:52,174
I just want to find my wife.

1983
01:51:52,212 --> 01:51:54,762
- I'm just trying to get clear...
- let me be clear.

1984
01:51:54,798 --> 01:51:59,218
Just because I am not a murderer
doesn't make me a good guy.

1985
01:51:59,261 --> 01:52:00,431
I'm not a good guy.

1986
01:52:00,846 --> 01:52:03,306
I was a bad husband to a great wife.

1987
01:52:03,682 --> 01:52:05,432
I broke the vow that I made to her.

1988
01:52:05,684 --> 01:52:08,234
Those are pretty words, Nick.

1989
01:52:08,562 --> 01:52:10,312
But what does that really mean to you?

1990
01:52:10,355 --> 01:52:12,395
It basically means
that I was a con artist.

1991
01:52:13,358 --> 01:52:16,568
I met Amy elliott seven years ago.

1992
01:52:16,612 --> 01:52:18,202
I was completely transfixed.

1993
01:52:18,655 --> 01:52:20,565
Amy can do that to you.

1994
01:52:20,616 --> 01:52:23,156
I was this average guy
from an average place...

1995
01:52:23,202 --> 01:52:25,202
With mediocre aspirations.

1996
01:52:25,245 --> 01:52:27,745
And I met a woman who dazzled me.

1997
01:52:27,789 --> 01:52:29,749
And I wanted her to love me...

1998
01:52:29,791 --> 01:52:32,131
So I pretended to be better than I was.

1999
01:52:33,003 --> 01:52:36,673
When we got married,
I promised to be that guy.

2000
01:52:36,715 --> 01:52:38,545
That guy who works harder.

2001
01:52:38,592 --> 01:52:40,802
That guy who, who lives and acts...

2002
01:52:40,844 --> 01:52:43,764
And loves with as much passion
as she does.

2003
01:52:44,014 --> 01:52:45,224
But I failed her.

2004
01:52:46,141 --> 01:52:47,501
Instead of doing what was right...

2005
01:52:48,769 --> 01:52:49,939
I did what was easy.

2006
01:52:50,687 --> 01:52:54,317
You talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife.

2007
01:52:54,358 --> 01:52:55,978
Who believes his wife is still alive.

2008
01:52:56,026 --> 01:52:57,316
She is still alive.

2009
01:52:59,196 --> 01:53:02,026
Will you look at that camera for me?

2010
01:53:02,366 --> 01:53:05,326
Will you look in the lens...

2011
01:53:05,369 --> 01:53:07,329
And talk to your wife?

2012
01:53:07,371 --> 01:53:10,461
If she is out there,
able to hear and see you tonight...

2013
01:53:10,499 --> 01:53:13,169
What would you like to say to her, Nick?

2014
01:53:16,713 --> 01:53:19,013
Amy, I love you.

2015
01:53:19,716 --> 01:53:22,506
You're the best person I've ever known.

2016
01:53:22,553 --> 01:53:27,023
And I've taken myself to the woodshed
for the way that I've treated you.

2017
01:53:27,057 --> 01:53:29,017
And if you come back, I promise...

2018
01:53:29,059 --> 01:53:31,559
I will spend every day
making it up to you.

2019
01:53:32,062 --> 01:53:35,902
I will be the man
that I promised you I would be.

2020
01:53:38,485 --> 01:53:39,485
I love you.

2021
01:53:40,404 --> 01:53:41,994
Come home.

2022
01:53:46,743 --> 01:53:47,743
Here.

2023
01:53:53,876 --> 01:53:55,496
Regardless of what you thought...

2024
01:53:55,544 --> 01:53:57,714
What does it say?

2025
01:53:57,754 --> 01:53:59,304
...I think we can all agree...

2026
01:53:59,339 --> 01:54:00,839
Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.

2027
01:54:00,883 --> 01:54:02,053
...there's more to him
than meets the eye.

2028
01:54:02,092 --> 01:54:03,212
They're going crazy for you.

2029
01:54:03,218 --> 01:54:07,718
They disliked me, they liked me,
they hated me.

2030
01:54:07,764 --> 01:54:09,394
And now they love me.

2031
01:54:09,433 --> 01:54:12,393
...a candor and an honesty
that's worthy of respect.

2032
01:54:12,436 --> 01:54:14,346
He's certainly earned mine.

2033
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:16,269
What is it?

2034
01:54:19,109 --> 01:54:22,279
I'm Sharon schieber. Good night.

2035
01:54:27,201 --> 01:54:29,991
Margo dunne, this is a search warrant
for your property.

2036
01:54:30,037 --> 01:54:32,247
I usually ignore tipline calls...

2037
01:54:32,289 --> 01:54:36,879
But a neighbor was concerned about
a strange man around your woodshed.

2038
01:54:37,294 --> 01:54:38,294
Call Tanner.

2039
01:54:38,295 --> 01:54:39,465
Okay. Fuck!

2040
01:54:43,592 --> 01:54:45,052
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.

2041
01:54:46,303 --> 01:54:47,383
Is that what this is about?

2042
01:54:48,805 --> 01:54:53,555
I have treated you more than fair
throughout this entire investigation.

2043
01:54:53,602 --> 01:54:55,902
I gave you the benefit of the doubt
over and over.

2044
01:54:55,938 --> 01:54:57,438
Every time you said something stupid...

2045
01:54:57,481 --> 01:54:59,861
I thought, "maybe he's just stupid."

2046
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:02,440
But I was wrong.
That's what this is about.

2047
01:55:02,486 --> 01:55:03,606
Are these the clubs
you don't play golf with?

2048
01:55:03,654 --> 01:55:04,654
None of that is mine.

2049
01:55:04,947 --> 01:55:06,527
None of this was put here by me.

2050
01:55:06,573 --> 01:55:10,123
Those are nice clubs.
You got the makings of a real man cave.

2051
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:13,290
Everything just waiting
until the wife goes away for good.

2052
01:55:13,330 --> 01:55:14,410
Nick!

2053
01:55:15,666 --> 01:55:18,586
- You can't do that!
- Of course we can.

2054
01:55:26,885 --> 01:55:29,465
Amy, it's time to move on.

2055
01:55:29,513 --> 01:55:31,223
What can I do to help?

2056
01:55:31,932 --> 01:55:33,482
I need some time to think.

2057
01:55:33,517 --> 01:55:36,017
- That's the last thing you need.
- Desi...

2058
01:55:36,061 --> 01:55:38,651
twenty years,
you have kept me dangling.

2059
01:55:38,689 --> 01:55:42,359
Finally, last night, you came to me,
and you chose me.

2060
01:55:43,068 --> 01:55:44,398
Follow that instinct.

2061
01:55:44,444 --> 01:55:46,864
Don't trust the instinct
that left you beaten and homeless...

2062
01:55:47,406 --> 01:55:50,576
Sleeping in your car,
fearing for your life.

2063
01:55:53,912 --> 01:55:56,622
I'm not gonna force myself on you.

2064
01:55:59,042 --> 01:56:01,712
I understand what you're saying, desi.

2065
01:56:02,963 --> 01:56:04,593
I do.

2066
01:56:07,926 --> 01:56:09,926
I've been so mistreated for so long.

2067
01:56:12,598 --> 01:56:15,478
I've forgotten how to behave.

2068
01:56:21,231 --> 01:56:23,531
I'll move in here tomorrow...

2069
01:56:23,567 --> 01:56:26,147
And we'll work it out together.

2070
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:31,948
I just want you to be you again.

2071
01:56:39,791 --> 01:56:41,311
They only took margo to fuck with you.

2072
01:56:41,335 --> 01:56:43,045
She's not spending
another fucking second in there.

2073
01:56:43,086 --> 01:56:45,836
I'm gonna go in,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

2074
01:56:46,507 --> 01:56:48,257
What?

2075
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:51,890
We tell boney very little.

2076
01:56:51,929 --> 01:56:54,059
Without a body,
without a murder weapon...

2077
01:56:54,097 --> 01:56:56,387
Their only hope is a confession.

2078
01:56:56,433 --> 01:56:58,393
So, you let them do all the talking.

2079
01:56:58,435 --> 01:57:00,555
That way,
we can jump-start your defense.

2080
01:57:00,604 --> 01:57:02,984
The truth is my defense.

2081
01:57:08,946 --> 01:57:09,946
Recognize these?

2082
01:57:09,947 --> 01:57:12,067
Yes.
It's Amy's anniversary present to me.

2083
01:57:12,115 --> 01:57:13,905
Was that how she told you
she was pregnant, Nick?

2084
01:57:13,951 --> 01:57:16,451
Mommy, daddy, baby,
and that made you real mad?

2085
01:57:16,954 --> 01:57:18,124
No.

2086
01:57:19,373 --> 01:57:21,493
- Recognize this?
- Never seen that before in my life.

2087
01:57:21,708 --> 01:57:24,958
It's Amy's diary.
We found this at your father's house.

2088
01:57:26,964 --> 01:57:28,264
Is this your wife's handwriting?

2089
01:57:28,298 --> 01:57:30,298
- He's not a handwriting ex...
- looks like it.

2090
01:57:30,342 --> 01:57:31,472
Our experts thought so, too.

2091
01:57:32,803 --> 01:57:34,513
Do you wanna
play a little true or false?

2092
01:57:35,264 --> 01:57:36,474
Sure.

2093
01:57:36,515 --> 01:57:40,985
"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips
so he can taste me."

2094
01:57:42,104 --> 01:57:44,114
Yeah, that's true.

2095
01:57:45,357 --> 01:57:47,357
You thought quinoa was a fish?

2096
01:57:48,652 --> 01:57:49,992
That is also true, yes.

2097
01:57:52,155 --> 01:57:54,275
She wanted to get pregnant,
you assaulted her.

2098
01:57:54,324 --> 01:57:56,334
I hit her? No, never happened.

2099
01:57:56,368 --> 01:57:57,988
- "Pushed," it says "pushed."
- Absolutely not.

2100
01:57:58,036 --> 01:57:59,116
I never touched her.

2101
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:03,170
She tried to buy a gun.

2102
01:58:03,834 --> 01:58:05,714
I doubt that, but I don't know.

2103
01:58:07,129 --> 01:58:08,759
Shall I read the last entry?

2104
01:58:08,797 --> 01:58:09,837
Sure.

2105
01:58:11,133 --> 01:58:13,263
"This man may kill me."

2106
01:58:13,302 --> 01:58:15,512
In her own words,
"this man may kill me."

2107
01:58:15,554 --> 01:58:17,684
It's kind of a convenient end note.

2108
01:58:24,188 --> 01:58:25,608
For future reference...

2109
01:58:25,647 --> 01:58:27,977
The truth,
you are not a handwriting expert.

2110
01:58:28,025 --> 01:58:29,075
Okay, I know.

2111
01:58:37,492 --> 01:58:39,332
Judy's missing handle.

2112
01:58:40,871 --> 01:58:43,161
Big as a two-by-four, right?
Big as a club.

2113
01:58:43,207 --> 01:58:45,957
We found this day one,
in the fireplace in your home office.

2114
01:58:46,001 --> 01:58:48,671
We didn't know what the hell it was,
but fire in July?

2115
01:58:48,712 --> 01:58:49,552
We bagged it.

2116
01:58:49,588 --> 01:58:50,708
I've never seen that before either.

2117
01:58:50,756 --> 01:58:53,376
We just tested it.
Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.

2118
01:58:53,425 --> 01:58:55,635
So, finally, Nicholas dunne...

2119
01:58:55,677 --> 01:58:57,297
You're under arrest
for the murder of your wife.

2120
01:58:57,346 --> 01:58:58,556
Do not say another word.

2121
01:58:58,597 --> 01:58:59,927
- What about my side?
- Nick!

2122
01:59:13,278 --> 01:59:14,738
More coffee?

2123
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:16,570
I'd love it.

2124
01:59:18,867 --> 01:59:22,497
Remember that time we skipped school
and drove to the cape?

2125
01:59:22,538 --> 01:59:25,078
God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.

2126
01:59:25,123 --> 01:59:26,753
This reminds me of that.

2127
01:59:27,251 --> 01:59:28,921
Never-ending holiday.

2128
01:59:30,462 --> 01:59:32,672
You're not bored?

2129
01:59:32,714 --> 01:59:34,224
Desi, how could I be bored?

2130
01:59:34,258 --> 01:59:36,718
You can discuss
18th-century symphonies...

2131
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:39,680
19th-century impressionists,
quote proust in French.

2132
01:59:40,055 --> 01:59:44,175
Nick's idea of culture
was a reality TV marathon...

2133
01:59:44,226 --> 01:59:46,096
With one hand down his boxers.

2134
01:59:48,105 --> 01:59:49,695
I really have to get going.

2135
01:59:50,023 --> 01:59:53,363
But I will be back
just as soon as I can.

2136
01:59:59,950 --> 02:00:01,030
My keys.

2137
02:00:06,248 --> 02:00:08,248
Thank you.

2138
02:00:19,469 --> 02:00:21,049
That's how the kids wear it.

2139
02:01:21,865 --> 02:01:25,695
Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.

2140
02:01:28,539 --> 02:01:29,709
Hey.

2141
02:01:30,123 --> 02:01:32,503
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Are you?

2142
02:01:32,543 --> 02:01:33,793
Yeah.

2143
02:01:33,836 --> 02:01:35,706
Let's go.

2144
02:01:37,548 --> 02:01:38,758
What does this mean?

2145
02:01:38,799 --> 02:01:40,969
Well, you're out on bond.

2146
02:01:41,009 --> 02:01:44,219
You can relax at home
while we prep for trial.

2147
02:01:49,726 --> 02:01:51,726
Keep your head down.

2148
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:09,540
Tanner, is there
any fucking lead on Amy?

2149
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:11,580
I've got two of my best guys on it.

2150
02:02:12,082 --> 02:02:13,712
She's air.

2151
02:02:15,752 --> 02:02:18,712
Come home, Amy. I dare you.

2152
02:03:15,938 --> 02:03:18,478
Mr. collings is home.

2153
02:03:18,524 --> 02:03:20,904
Hello, Mr. collings.

2154
02:03:20,943 --> 02:03:22,823
I've missed you.

2155
02:03:22,861 --> 02:03:24,491
I've been thinking...

2156
02:03:24,947 --> 02:03:27,117
I don't wanna be without you.

2157
02:03:27,824 --> 02:03:30,164
Stay with me.

2158
02:03:30,202 --> 02:03:33,162
And when all this dies down,
we'll go to Greece, like you said.

2159
02:03:33,205 --> 02:03:35,505
Octopus and scrabble?

2160
02:03:37,501 --> 02:03:39,751
How long do you think until it's done?

2161
02:03:39,795 --> 02:03:43,385
Not long. Six months for the trial.
Sentencing will be quick.

2162
02:03:43,882 --> 02:03:44,972
He'll appeal.

2163
02:03:45,008 --> 02:03:47,138
I can watch the rest overseas.

2164
02:04:04,528 --> 02:04:05,818
Go slowly.

2165
02:04:05,863 --> 02:04:06,863
But I want it.

2166
02:04:27,217 --> 02:04:28,797
Don't rush.

2167
02:04:28,844 --> 02:04:30,934
Just do it.

2168
02:04:39,396 --> 02:04:40,936
Harder.

2169
02:06:19,496 --> 02:06:22,666
You fucking bitch.

2170
02:06:31,341 --> 02:06:35,011
Don't you worry,
you're gonna have lots of babies.

2171
02:06:36,638 --> 02:06:40,138
Her wounds are consistent with rape.
There was semen present.

2172
02:06:40,184 --> 02:06:41,344
We'll make sure it's a match.

2173
02:06:41,351 --> 02:06:43,101
Yeah, it'll match.

2174
02:06:43,145 --> 02:06:45,615
Thank you very much.

2175
02:06:45,647 --> 02:06:47,147
What do you think?

2176
02:06:47,191 --> 02:06:48,481
Are we pals again?

2177
02:06:48,525 --> 02:06:52,065
Now that I know
you didn't murder your wife, yes.

2178
02:06:52,112 --> 02:06:53,112
What do you think?

2179
02:06:53,113 --> 02:06:56,033
Kidnapping? The story's insane.

2180
02:06:58,202 --> 02:07:00,662
She's on fairly heavy painkillers.

2181
02:07:00,704 --> 02:07:02,624
It's okay. I want to help.

2182
02:07:02,664 --> 02:07:04,084
Ms. dunne, I know
what you've been through...

2183
02:07:04,124 --> 02:07:06,464
So we'll keep this very brief.

2184
02:07:06,502 --> 02:07:08,882
Can you walk us through what happened?

2185
02:07:11,507 --> 02:07:14,127
That morning, the doorbell rang.

2186
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:17,010
So normal.

2187
02:07:17,054 --> 02:07:18,894
I opened the door.

2188
02:07:19,515 --> 02:07:21,355
So strange.

2189
02:07:21,975 --> 02:07:25,595
Since high school,
he won't ever go away.

2190
02:07:25,646 --> 02:07:28,726
And I've just tried to be nice to him.

2191
02:07:28,774 --> 02:07:30,404
Answer his letters.

2192
02:07:30,651 --> 02:07:32,651
Keep him calm.

2193
02:07:34,071 --> 02:07:35,531
Oh, my God.

2194
02:07:36,156 --> 02:07:37,776
I've encouraged him.

2195
02:07:37,824 --> 02:07:39,624
You can't blame yourself.

2196
02:07:41,245 --> 02:07:43,415
He pushed inside.

2197
02:07:44,998 --> 02:07:47,038
And he grabbed me.

2198
02:07:47,751 --> 02:07:50,841
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.

2199
02:07:51,171 --> 02:07:52,881
And he clubbed me.

2200
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:54,760
I collapsed.

2201
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:58,850
That club was actually the handle
to a punch and Judy puppet.

2202
02:07:58,887 --> 02:08:00,307
Right.

2203
02:08:01,223 --> 02:08:02,643
Treasure hunt.

2204
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:06,600
I'd hidden some puppets at go's...

2205
02:08:06,645 --> 02:08:08,365
then how did desi have that handle?

2206
02:08:10,232 --> 02:08:12,152
I'd just found it.

2207
02:08:12,901 --> 02:08:15,321
It must have fallen off.

2208
02:08:17,239 --> 02:08:20,909
I was holding it when desi pushed in.
So, he got it from me.

2209
02:08:20,951 --> 02:08:22,161
About that woodshed...

2210
02:08:22,202 --> 02:08:23,872
He took me to his lake house.

2211
02:08:24,454 --> 02:08:26,164
Tied me to his bed.

2212
02:08:26,206 --> 02:08:28,746
Back to the woodshed real quick.
Real quick.

2213
02:08:28,792 --> 02:08:30,632
When you went
to place the puppets there...

2214
02:08:30,669 --> 02:08:32,069
Did you notice that it was packed...

2215
02:08:32,087 --> 02:08:33,247
lots of stuff.

2216
02:08:33,297 --> 02:08:37,717
Corresponding to purchases made
on credit cards in your husband's name.

2217
02:08:37,759 --> 02:08:39,259
Nick and credit cards.

2218
02:08:39,303 --> 02:08:41,853
He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.

2219
02:08:41,889 --> 02:08:44,679
He hid a lot of stuff at go's.
They're very close.

2220
02:08:45,225 --> 02:08:49,555
Now, may I go back
to where I was being held prisoner...

2221
02:08:49,605 --> 02:08:52,365
By a man with a history
of mental problems?

2222
02:08:52,399 --> 02:08:53,479
Please continue, Ms. dunne.

2223
02:08:57,779 --> 02:08:59,859
Desi assaulted me that night.

2224
02:09:00,824 --> 02:09:02,664
Every night.

2225
02:09:03,785 --> 02:09:06,195
He tied me up like a dog.

2226
02:09:07,581 --> 02:09:10,081
And then, he'd punish me.

2227
02:09:12,002 --> 02:09:14,052
Starve me.

2228
02:09:15,339 --> 02:09:17,259
Shave me.

2229
02:09:18,884 --> 02:09:20,844
Sodomize me.

2230
02:09:21,637 --> 02:09:23,467
There were cameras everywhere.

2231
02:09:23,514 --> 02:09:26,474
Please find this. Please find the tapes.

2232
02:09:28,143 --> 02:09:31,353
She slit his throat with a box cutter.

2233
02:09:32,439 --> 02:09:34,649
How did she manage
to get a hold of a box cutter...

2234
02:09:34,691 --> 02:09:37,281
If he had her tied up the whole time?

2235
02:09:38,237 --> 02:09:40,277
Can't you just be happy
your wife is home and safe?

2236
02:09:41,073 --> 02:09:43,033
Amy, we found your diary.

2237
02:09:43,075 --> 02:09:47,165
It contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse.

2238
02:09:47,204 --> 02:09:50,084
Well, it's the ugly truth.

2239
02:09:50,916 --> 02:09:52,416
Nick didn't want a baby.

2240
02:09:54,253 --> 02:09:57,553
He has a temper. We had money problems.

2241
02:09:58,465 --> 02:09:59,585
But I love him.

2242
02:09:59,633 --> 02:10:01,383
Then why did you try to buy a gun?

2243
02:10:03,345 --> 02:10:05,425
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.

2244
02:10:05,472 --> 02:10:07,312
If I could just clarify one thing...

2245
02:10:07,349 --> 02:10:10,559
if this case had been left
in your deeply incompetent hands...

2246
02:10:10,602 --> 02:10:12,482
My husband would be on death row...

2247
02:10:12,771 --> 02:10:16,521
And I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...

2248
02:10:16,817 --> 02:10:20,487
Ms. dunne, you've been very brave.
We're finished.

2249
02:10:21,363 --> 02:10:23,533
Now, I have to ask you...

2250
02:10:23,574 --> 02:10:26,414
Do you feel safe
going home with your husband?

2251
02:10:38,839 --> 02:10:41,469
We prayed to God,
and God has answered our prayers.

2252
02:10:41,508 --> 02:10:42,878
Amy dunne is home.

2253
02:10:42,926 --> 02:10:45,006
Now, I know there are
a lot of questions and concerns...

2254
02:10:45,053 --> 02:10:47,063
But for right now, we wanna sit tight...

2255
02:10:47,097 --> 02:10:52,017
And just be thankful and grateful
for this miracle on the Mississippi.

2256
02:10:59,484 --> 02:11:01,284
Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.

2257
02:11:53,038 --> 02:11:54,248
We love you, Amy!

2258
02:11:58,877 --> 02:12:00,707
All right, you can stop pretending now.

2259
02:12:00,754 --> 02:12:02,424
I'm not pretending.

2260
02:12:03,131 --> 02:12:04,841
You were perfect.

2261
02:12:05,467 --> 02:12:08,007
The Nick I saw on TV,
that's the Nick I fell in love with.

2262
02:12:08,053 --> 02:12:10,763
You do know I was just telling you
what you wanted to hear, right?

2263
02:12:10,806 --> 02:12:12,636
That's how well you know me.

2264
02:12:12,683 --> 02:12:15,313
You know me in your marrow.

2265
02:12:16,311 --> 02:12:17,901
Okay.

2266
02:12:17,938 --> 02:12:21,268
You need to tell me
exactly what happened.

2267
02:12:22,568 --> 02:12:23,818
Take off your clothes.

2268
02:12:24,319 --> 02:12:27,529
I need to make sure
you're not wearing a wire.

2269
02:12:40,836 --> 02:12:44,836
You killed someone, Amy.
You're a murderer.

2270
02:12:44,882 --> 02:12:46,472
I'm a fighter.

2271
02:12:46,508 --> 02:12:48,968
I fought my way back to you.

2272
02:12:49,011 --> 02:12:50,851
You killed a guy.

2273
02:12:50,888 --> 02:12:52,848
You slashed his throat
with a box cutter.

2274
02:12:52,890 --> 02:12:57,560
You went on national television
and begged for me to save your life.

2275
02:12:58,145 --> 02:12:59,405
And I obliged.

2276
02:12:59,438 --> 02:13:00,898
But I want that Nick.

2277
02:13:01,231 --> 02:13:02,651
I'm leaving.

2278
02:13:02,691 --> 02:13:05,321
You really think that's smart?

2279
02:13:05,986 --> 02:13:06,986
Shampoo.

2280
02:13:09,698 --> 02:13:13,618
Wounded, raped wife battles her way
back to her husband...

2281
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:15,540
And he deserts her.

2282
02:13:15,579 --> 02:13:16,619
They'll destroy you.

2283
02:13:17,372 --> 02:13:18,872
Neighbors will shun you.

2284
02:13:18,916 --> 02:13:23,126
And I'll make sure that no one forgets
the pain you caused me.

2285
02:13:25,214 --> 02:13:30,304
I don't want anything to do
with your groupies outside.

2286
02:13:30,886 --> 02:13:32,506
Once they go...

2287
02:13:33,388 --> 02:13:34,308
I go.

2288
02:13:34,348 --> 02:13:37,768
Give it the night. Sleep on it.

2289
02:13:54,618 --> 02:13:56,198
Was there ever a baby?

2290
02:13:56,495 --> 02:13:58,585
There can be.

2291
02:14:02,584 --> 02:14:03,594
Good night.

2292
02:14:56,513 --> 02:14:58,183
Hey, Nick!

2293
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:11,569
Hello, handsome.

2294
02:15:14,698 --> 02:15:16,448
Crepe?

2295
02:15:17,159 --> 02:15:18,079
Sure.

2296
02:15:18,118 --> 02:15:19,828
She was his dream girl.

2297
02:15:19,870 --> 02:15:23,290
And when this spoiled, rich,
entitled little boy couldn't have her...

2298
02:15:23,332 --> 02:15:24,712
He took her.

2299
02:15:32,090 --> 02:15:33,430
You must be so proud.

2300
02:15:40,682 --> 02:15:42,682
It's been four hours.

2301
02:15:43,185 --> 02:15:46,025
Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?

2302
02:15:50,192 --> 02:15:53,032
Right now, it's all about our marriage.

2303
02:15:53,862 --> 02:15:57,372
When two people love each other
and can't make that work...

2304
02:15:57,407 --> 02:15:59,827
That's the real tragedy.

2305
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:05,620
Kiss my cheek.

2306
02:16:11,964 --> 02:16:14,764
I can't believe that fucking spider
is America's sweetheart.

2307
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:17,010
She told me she killed desi.

2308
02:16:17,052 --> 02:16:18,392
Not self-defense. Murder.

2309
02:16:18,428 --> 02:16:19,968
- Can't we get a wire?
- That's not gonna work.

2310
02:16:20,013 --> 02:16:21,183
She told you once before.

2311
02:16:21,223 --> 02:16:23,563
Yeah, because she had me strip naked,
and stand in the shower.

2312
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:26,850
I swear, you two are the most
fucked-up people I've ever known.

2313
02:16:26,895 --> 02:16:28,355
And I specialize in fucked-up.

2314
02:16:28,605 --> 02:16:30,435
You and Amy under the same roof?

2315
02:16:30,482 --> 02:16:32,282
You should pitch that
as reality television.

2316
02:16:32,901 --> 02:16:35,281
Amy dunne,
and the miracle on the Mississippi.

2317
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:37,820
Nick and I have been through
some bad patches.

2318
02:16:37,865 --> 02:16:39,205
We've had our dark days.

2319
02:16:39,241 --> 02:16:41,081
But we thank you so much...

2320
02:16:41,577 --> 02:16:46,117
For supporting us in our new life together,
for forgiving Nick.

2321
02:16:46,373 --> 02:16:50,093
Really, your encouragement
means the world.

2322
02:16:50,127 --> 02:16:51,537
She's good.

2323
02:16:51,587 --> 02:16:54,167
Amazing Amy and the humbled husband.

2324
02:16:54,214 --> 02:16:56,304
The real housewives of branson.

2325
02:16:56,341 --> 02:16:57,431
Take care of this guy, will you?

2326
02:16:57,467 --> 02:16:59,067
I can't believe you're just leaving now.

2327
02:16:59,094 --> 02:17:00,644
You are not at risk anymore.

2328
02:17:00,679 --> 02:17:02,219
I'm the definition of "at risk."

2329
02:17:02,264 --> 02:17:06,394
You got a book deal, a lifetime movie,
you franchised the bar.

2330
02:17:06,435 --> 02:17:07,485
You may wanna thank her.

2331
02:17:10,522 --> 02:17:11,942
Just don't piss her off.

2332
02:17:12,774 --> 02:17:13,774
See you, guys.

2333
02:17:15,903 --> 02:17:17,573
Elvis has left Missouri.

2334
02:17:17,613 --> 02:17:18,703
She had to have made a mistake.

2335
02:17:18,739 --> 02:17:21,029
We need to check Amy's story,
piece by piece.

2336
02:17:21,074 --> 02:17:22,954
Nick, I can't do anything.

2337
02:17:23,368 --> 02:17:26,198
We had the national spotlight on us,
we stained the rug.

2338
02:17:26,246 --> 02:17:27,966
The case is with the feds now,
they're done.

2339
02:17:27,998 --> 02:17:29,038
That doesn't mean you have to be done.

2340
02:17:29,458 --> 02:17:31,248
It does.

2341
02:18:02,824 --> 02:18:04,284
What are you doing?

2342
02:18:06,203 --> 02:18:07,793
Couldn't sleep.

2343
02:18:07,829 --> 02:18:08,829
Come on...

2344
02:18:09,122 --> 02:18:11,292
Let me tuck you back in.

2345
02:18:23,971 --> 02:18:26,601
You know you can sleep with me, right?

2346
02:18:28,684 --> 02:18:30,774
Yeah, it's just...

2347
02:18:30,811 --> 02:18:32,311
I need more time.

2348
02:18:32,354 --> 02:18:35,904
I would never, ever hurt you.

2349
02:18:37,693 --> 02:18:40,153
I do need you to participate, though.

2350
02:18:40,195 --> 02:18:42,355
I need you to do your part.

2351
02:18:52,666 --> 02:18:53,666
Okay.

2352
02:18:54,418 --> 02:18:57,248
Everything you have heard
about my wife...

2353
02:18:57,296 --> 02:18:58,666
Is a lie.

2354
02:18:58,714 --> 02:19:02,804
She is a calculating,
murderous psychopath.

2355
02:19:03,427 --> 02:19:04,967
And I have been complicit...

2356
02:19:05,012 --> 02:19:06,142
Nick!

2357
02:19:11,810 --> 02:19:13,980
Nick? Breakfast.

2358
02:19:14,021 --> 02:19:15,021
Honey?

2359
02:19:18,567 --> 02:19:21,027
We should hold hands.

2360
02:19:21,069 --> 02:19:24,159
Not the entire time,
but on and off throughout.

2361
02:19:25,574 --> 02:19:27,784
"So, Nick, how does it feel
to have your wife back?"

2362
02:19:30,412 --> 02:19:32,292
"It's fantastic.

2363
02:19:32,331 --> 02:19:35,381
"How many people are lucky enough
to get a second chance at love?"

2364
02:19:35,417 --> 02:19:37,127
"Fantastic" is a little flippant.

2365
02:19:37,544 --> 02:19:38,674
"Amazing"?

2366
02:19:38,712 --> 02:19:41,552
I need you
to admit that you got the credit cards...

2367
02:19:41,590 --> 02:19:44,590
And that you hid all that stuff at go's
and that you pushed me.

2368
02:19:45,344 --> 02:19:48,394
I'm gonna need
those three things to feel safe.

2369
02:19:49,598 --> 02:19:51,428
You have to own this, Nick.

2370
02:19:52,226 --> 02:19:55,766
Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.

2371
02:19:57,356 --> 02:19:59,106
Nick.

2372
02:20:02,069 --> 02:20:04,699
What a beautiful home.

2373
02:20:05,948 --> 02:20:08,618
I so appreciate
you giving us this time, Nick.

2374
02:20:08,659 --> 02:20:10,829
You went on national television...

2375
02:20:10,869 --> 02:20:13,329
And told people that I murdered my wife.

2376
02:20:13,372 --> 02:20:14,622
I go where the story goes.

2377
02:20:14,665 --> 02:20:17,635
You implied that I had carnal relations
with my sister.

2378
02:20:17,668 --> 02:20:21,208
I didn't use the "I" word.
I said you two were "extremely close."

2379
02:20:21,255 --> 02:20:25,935
You and a panel of nitwits
diagnosed me as a sociopath.

2380
02:20:27,135 --> 02:20:28,885
Ice-breaker.

2381
02:20:32,599 --> 02:20:34,389
To go with your robot dog.

2382
02:20:34,434 --> 02:20:36,484
I'll go find Amy.

2383
02:20:38,522 --> 02:20:40,612
She's downstairs.

2384
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:44,740
- What is it?
- It's for you.

2385
02:20:44,778 --> 02:20:46,198
Open it.

2386
02:20:46,488 --> 02:20:48,238
I don't need any more gifts from you.

2387
02:20:48,282 --> 02:20:49,992
Open it.

2388
02:21:02,546 --> 02:21:04,206
I didn't touch you.

2389
02:21:04,256 --> 02:21:05,296
You didn't need to.

2390
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:08,550
Bullshit. That notice of disposal.

2391
02:21:08,594 --> 02:21:10,104
I have that. You threw it out.

2392
02:21:10,137 --> 02:21:11,967
The notice, yes.

2393
02:21:12,347 --> 02:21:13,347
I want a blood test.

2394
02:21:13,765 --> 02:21:14,845
I want a paternity test.

2395
02:21:15,642 --> 02:21:16,982
I love tests.

2396
02:21:17,019 --> 02:21:18,849
You can teach those people
to hate me all you want.

2397
02:21:18,896 --> 02:21:21,606
I don't care. I am leaving you.

2398
02:21:23,734 --> 02:21:26,444
I won't have to teach your child
to hate you.

2399
02:21:26,486 --> 02:21:28,856
He'll do that all by himself.

2400
02:21:28,906 --> 02:21:30,776
You fucking cunt!

2401
02:21:32,659 --> 02:21:35,039
I'm the cunt you married.

2402
02:21:35,078 --> 02:21:36,868
The only time you liked yourself...

2403
02:21:36,914 --> 02:21:40,584
Was when you were trying to be someone
this cunt might like.

2404
02:21:40,626 --> 02:21:44,086
I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.

2405
02:21:47,841 --> 02:21:51,091
I've killed for you.
Who else can say that?

2406
02:21:52,346 --> 02:21:54,886
You think you would be happy
with a nice midwestern girl?

2407
02:21:54,932 --> 02:21:57,772
No way, baby. I'm it.

2408
02:21:57,809 --> 02:22:01,229
Look, you're delusional. You're insane.

2409
02:22:01,271 --> 02:22:02,771
Why would you even want this?

2410
02:22:03,148 --> 02:22:04,228
Yes, I loved you.

2411
02:22:04,274 --> 02:22:07,744
And then all we did was resent each other,
and try to control each other.

2412
02:22:07,778 --> 02:22:08,818
And cause each other pain.

2413
02:22:09,321 --> 02:22:11,111
That's marriage.

2414
02:22:13,784 --> 02:22:16,164
Now, I'm getting ready.

2415
02:22:41,478 --> 02:22:44,558
I can't watch you play house
with that thing for the next 18 years.

2416
02:22:44,606 --> 02:22:46,266
I can't just walk away.

2417
02:22:46,316 --> 02:22:47,896
You could get custody.

2418
02:22:47,943 --> 02:22:51,823
No, I won't. And you know it.

2419
02:22:51,864 --> 02:22:54,374
It's gonna be my child.
I'm not gonna leave it.

2420
02:22:54,992 --> 02:22:56,792
You wanna stay.

2421
02:22:56,827 --> 02:23:00,747
I have a responsibility.
It's not about what I want anymore.

2422
02:23:00,789 --> 02:23:02,039
You wanna stay with her.

2423
02:23:12,676 --> 02:23:13,716
You're breaking my heart.

2424
02:23:14,178 --> 02:23:17,808
Go, you're my voice of reason.

2425
02:23:17,848 --> 02:23:20,348
I need you with me on this.

2426
02:23:20,392 --> 02:23:22,852
Of course I'm with you.

2427
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:29,480
I was with you before we were even born.

2428
02:23:31,236 --> 02:23:34,026
We've been through the darkness.

2429
02:23:34,573 --> 02:23:37,873
We've come out, united.

2430
02:23:40,871 --> 02:23:43,041
We communicate.

2431
02:23:45,334 --> 02:23:47,844
We're honest with each other.

2432
02:23:47,878 --> 02:23:49,378
Right?

2433
02:23:51,298 --> 02:23:53,798
We're partners in crime.

2434
02:23:57,179 --> 02:23:58,179
And?

2435
02:23:59,890 --> 02:24:01,220
And?

2436
02:24:04,728 --> 02:24:06,648
We're gonna be parents.

2437
02:24:08,357 --> 02:24:09,977
My goodness!

2438
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:12,360
- How exciting!
- Thank you.

2439
02:24:17,157 --> 02:24:19,527
"What are you thinking?"

2440
02:24:22,371 --> 02:24:24,581
"How are you feeling?"

2441
02:24:26,542 --> 02:24:29,172
"What have we done to each other?"

2442
02:24:30,754 --> 02:24:32,844
"What will we do?"
