1
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:44,627
THE SEVENTH SEAL

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,500
It is the middle of the 14th Century.

3
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,001
Antonius Block and his squire, after long years
as crusaders in the holy land...

4
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:44,000
have at last returned to their native Sweden.
A land ravaged by the black plague.

5
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:05,177
And when the Lamb
opened the seventh seal,

6
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:08,893
there was in heaven a silence

7
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:13,272
which lasted about the space
of half an hour.

8
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:18,273
And the seven angels
who had the seven trumpets

9
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:24,003
prepared themselves to sound.

10
00:04:17,271 --> 00:04:21,983
- Who are you?
- I am Death.

11
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:26,321
- Have you come to fetch me?
- I have long walked at your side.

12
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:30,408
- That I know.
- Are you ready?

13
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:34,519
My body is, not myself.

14
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:45,757
- Wait a moment.
- You all say that.

15
00:04:45,758 --> 00:04:50,758
- But I leave no respite.
- You play chess, don't you?

16
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:55,805
- How do you know?
- From paintings and folk songs.

17
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,480
Yes, I'm actually
quite a skilful chess player.

18
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:04,484
- Not more so than me.
- Why play chess with me?

19
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:09,485
- That's my affair.
- You are right.

20
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,909
The condition is I live
as long as I resist you.

21
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,910
If I conquer you, you free me.

22
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:25,674
You have black.

23
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,090
It's most appropriate, isn't it?

24
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:46,253
Squeezed twixt the thighs
On a bed of sighs

25
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:49,631
That's the only way to be

26
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:52,842
For a man like me

27
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:02,978
Our Lord sits up high
He is somewhat shy

28
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:07,979
But Satan, your crony
Ensures you won't be lonely

29
00:07:09,443 --> 00:07:13,697
They talk of omens
and other horrors in Färjestad.

30
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:16,908
Two horses ate
one another last night.

31
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,909
Graves had been opened in the cemetery
and remains scattered about.

32
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:28,499
There were four suns in the heavens
yesterday afternoon.

33
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:51,147
Can you tell me the way to the inn?

34
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,301
- Did he indicate the way?
- Not exactly.

35
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:20,054
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

36
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:23,432
- Was he dumb?
- No, one can't say that.

37
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:28,228
I'd say that he was
extremely well-spoken.

38
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:33,229
Yes, well-spoken. But the speech
he made was dour. I have to say.

39
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:09,663
Good morning.
Have you had any breakfast?

40
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:14,042
Unfortunately, I can't eat grass.
Can't you teach me?

41
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:19,043
Things are tight. People aren't
interested in art in these parts.

42
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:19,024
Mia, wake up! I've seen something
I must tell you about.

43
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:22,528
- Has something happened?
- I've had a vision.

44
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,573
No, not a vision.
It was like it was real.

45
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:31,574
I see... Have you had another vision?

46
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:36,488
I saw her, anyway.

47
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:41,626
- Who? Who did you see?
- The Holy Virgin Mary.

48
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:47,219
- Really?
- She was so close I could touch her.

49
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,931
She had a crown of gold
and a blue dress with flowers,

50
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:54,810
and she was barefoot
and had small brown hands.

51
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:58,605
She held the child
and taught him to walk.

52
00:11:58,606 --> 00:12:03,068
Then she saw that I'd seen her
and she smiled at me.

53
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:08,069
I got tears in my eyes and when
I wiped them away, she disappeared.

54
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:13,161
And it became
utterly, utterly quiet everywhere.

55
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:18,162
In heaven and on earth.
Can you understand that?

56
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:24,544
- The things you come up with.
- You don't believe me, but it was real.

57
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:30,304
Not your kind of reality,
but another reality.

58
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:35,305
Like when you said the Devil painted
our wagon wheels red using his tail.

59
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:38,894
Why bring that up?

60
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:43,895
- Red paint was under your nails.
- Yes, that time it was made up.

61
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:48,696
I did it so you'd believe in
my other visions. The real ones.

62
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:53,697
Control your visions, or you'll be
taken for a fool, which you aren't.

63
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:59,081
At least not yet, as far as I know.
But one never knows.

64
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:04,082
I didn't ask for my visions! I can't
help the Holy Virgin revealing herself

65
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:08,758
and that angels and devils
like to be with me.

66
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:13,759
Haven't I said it once and for all
that I need to sleep in the morning?

67
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:18,351
I've asked you, begged you,
but nothing helps.

68
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:23,352
That's why I'm now saying... Quiet!

69
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:37,954
Mikael, Mikael, Mikael...

70
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:52,214
- He should have a better life than us.
- Mikael will be a great acrobat.

71
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:57,390
Or maybe a juggler who accomplishes
the only impossible trick.

72
00:13:57,391 --> 00:14:01,894
- What trick is that?
- Make one ball remain still in the air.

73
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:06,895
- It's impossible.
- For us it is. But not for him.

74
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:12,608
You and your fantasies...

75
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:17,948
I made up a new song last night.
I lay awake almost all night.

76
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:23,704
- Do you want to hear my song?
- Sing it. I'm really curious.

77
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,959
There sits a dove on the lily
In the midst of summer

78
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:35,720
She sings her fair song of Jesus Christ

79
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:40,721
There is great rejoicing in heaven

80
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:47,477
- Mia, are you asleep?
- It was a very beautiful song.

81
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:52,403
- It's not finished yet.
- I'm just going to sleep a little more.

82
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:57,404
- You can sing the rest later.
- You just sleep and sleep.

83
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,497
Is this disguise worthy of an actor?
I'm only asking.

84
00:15:03,498 --> 00:15:07,752
- If the priests didn't pay, I'd refuse.
- Are you playing Death?

85
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:12,214
Frighten decent people out of their wits
with such nonsense.

86
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:16,427
- When are we going to do it?
- At the All Saints Festival in Elsinore.

87
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:19,930
On the actual church steps. Not bad.

88
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:24,643
Why not something bawdy?
People like it and it's funnier.

89
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:29,644
Idiot. There's an evil sickness about

90
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:34,069
and priests are preaching
grim death and moral bellyaches.

91
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,449
- What roles will we play?
- You're the human soul, you twit.

92
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,450
- Naturally it's a bad role.
- Who decides? Who's the manager?

93
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:50,707
You fools, keep this law in mind.
Life's thread is of the weakest kind.

94
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:57,676
Life is short, you will find.

95
00:15:57,677 --> 00:16:02,677
Will women love me in this costume?
I'm only asking.

96
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:19,532
Jof? Stand perfectly still.
Don't say anything.

97
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:24,533
- I'm quiet as a mouse.
- I love you.

98
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:56,277
- What are you painting?
- The dance of Death.

99
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:00,364
- That's Death?
- Yes, he dances away with them all.

100
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:05,365
- Why paint such daubings?
- To remind people they will die.

101
00:17:05,662 --> 00:17:10,291
- That won't make them happier.
- Why always make them happy?

102
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:14,712
- Why not frighten them a bit?
- They'll just close their eyes then.

103
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:19,713
Believe me, they'll look. A skull is more
interesting than a naked wench.

104
00:17:20,385 --> 00:17:25,384
- And if you frighten them?
- They'll think and be more frightened.

105
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:29,726
- And rush into the priest's embrace.
- Not my business.

106
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:34,480
- You're just painting Death's dance.
- I'm only showing how it is.

107
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:39,481
- You'll anger certain people.
- Then I'll paint something cheerful.

108
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:45,404
One has to make a living.
At least until the plague claims you.

109
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:48,703
The plague? That's horrifying.

110
00:17:48,704 --> 00:17:53,499
You should see the boil
on the neck of the sick.

111
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,500
See how the body contracts, until
his limbs become a rope of madness.

112
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:06,304
- It doesn't look good.
- Yes... It doesn't look good.

113
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:10,475
He's trying to tear
the bubo out of his bed.

114
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:15,476
He gnaws at his hands,
rips out his veins with his nails.

115
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:19,776
His scream is heard everywhere.

116
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:22,862
- Are you scared?
- Scared? Me?

117
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:27,033
You don't know me.
What nonsense is that you've painted?

118
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:31,037
The strange thing is that people see

119
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,499
the plague
as a punishment from God.

120
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Supplicants trail through the land
and whip themselves into God's favor.

121
00:18:41,924 --> 00:18:46,636
- They beat themselves?
- Yes, it's an awful sight.

122
00:18:46,637 --> 00:18:51,637
You want to run and hide
when they come.

123
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:55,520
Have you got any schnapps?
I've been drinking water all day.

124
00:18:55,521 --> 00:19:00,521
- I'm thirsty as a camel in the desert.
- You did get a little scared, after all.

125
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:35,931
I want to confess as honestly as I can,
but my heart is empty.

126
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:42,146
And emptiness is a mirror
turned to my own face.

127
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:48,110
I see myself
and am seized by disgust and fear.

128
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:59,038
Through my indifference for people,
I've been placed outside of their society.

129
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:06,211
Now I live in a ghost world,
enclosed in my dreams and imaginings.

130
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:11,596
- Despite that, you don't want to die.
- Yes, I want to.

131
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:16,476
- What are you waiting for?
- I want knowledge.

132
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:21,477
- You want guarantees.
- Call it what you like.

133
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:30,406
Is it so terribly inconceivable
to comprehend God with one's senses?

134
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:35,407
Why does He hide in a cloud of
half-promises and unseen miracles?

135
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:41,751
How can we believe in the faithful
when we lack faith?

136
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:45,838
What will happen to us
who want to believe, but cannot?

137
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,801
What about those
who neither want to nor can believe?

138
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:52,386
Why can't I kill God in me?

139
00:20:52,387 --> 00:20:56,224
Why does He live on in me
in an humiliating way

140
00:20:56,225 --> 00:21:00,269
despite my wanting to evict Him
from my heart?

141
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:05,270
Why is He, despite all,
a mocking reality I can't be rid of?

142
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:10,655
- Do you hear?
- I hear you.

143
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:15,656
I want knowledge! Not faith,
not assumptions, but knowledge.

144
00:21:16,954 --> 00:21:21,954
I want God to stretch out His hand,
uncover His face and speak to me.

145
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:28,127
- But He remains silent.
- I call out to Him in the darkness.

146
00:21:28,382 --> 00:21:33,302
- But it's as if no one was there.
- Perhaps there isn't anyone.

147
00:21:33,303 --> 00:21:36,264
Then life is a preposterous horror.

148
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:41,265
No man can live faced with Death,
knowing everything's nothingness.

149
00:21:41,603 --> 00:21:44,939
Most people think neither of Death
nor nothingness.

150
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,940
But one day you stand
at the edge of life and face darkness.

151
00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:54,945
- That day.
- I understand what you mean.

152
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,744
We must make an idol of our fear

153
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:02,456
and that idol we shall call God.

154
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:05,277
You are worried.

155
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:10,459
Death came to see me this morning.
We played chess together.

156
00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:15,468
The respite allows me
to attend to some business.

157
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:17,869
What business?

158
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:22,851
All my life I've been searching,
wondering,

159
00:22:22,852 --> 00:22:26,146
talking without meaning or context.

160
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:31,147
It has been nothing. Yes, I say so
without bitterness or self-reproach,

161
00:22:32,695 --> 00:22:37,695
as I know that almost all of people’s
lives are made this way.

162
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,950
But I want to use my respite
for one meaningful act.

163
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,920
That's why you are playing chess with Death.

164
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:54,921
He's a difficult and skilful tactician,
but so far I have not surrendered a piece.

165
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,014
How can you outwit Death in your game?

166
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:04,851
I'm playing a combination
of bishop and knight

167
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:09,852
that he hasn't noticed yet.
I'll expose his flank in the next move.

168
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:15,249
I'll remember that.

169
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:24,867
You're a traitor. And you cheated me.

170
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:31,123
But we'll meet again.
And I'll find a way.

171
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,420
We'll meet at the inn.
We'll continue our game then.

172
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:47,598
This is my hand. I can move it.

173
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:51,939
My blood gushes in it.

174
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:55,777
The sun is still high in the sky.

175
00:23:55,778 --> 00:24:00,488
And I... I, Antonius Block,

176
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:07,645
am playing chess with Death.

177
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:11,418
My master and I have been abroad.

178
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:16,419
Do you understand, my dear... Pictor?

179
00:24:16,465 --> 00:24:19,843
- The crusades.
- Exactly.

180
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:23,263
For 10 years,
we let snakes bite us,

181
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:27,434
insects sting us, animals maul us,
heathens slaughter us,

182
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:32,435
the wine poison us, women infect us,
lice eat us, fever rot us.

183
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:37,898
- Everything in the name of God.
- In the name of God.

184
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:44,947
Our crusade was so stupid,
only an idealist could have invented it.

185
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:56,917
- All this about the plague is awful.
- It's worse than that.

186
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:02,677
Oh, yes... It's always
your own arse you sit on.

187
00:25:02,678 --> 00:25:07,678
- A great truth.
- Your own arse. Your own arse.

188
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,560
- A profound truth.
- Here is Jöns the squire.

189
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:19,652
He grins at Death, guffaws at the Lord,
laughs at himself, smiles at the girls.

190
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:24,032
His world is believable
to no one but himself.

191
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:27,327
Ridiculous to everyone, even himself.

192
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:32,328
Meaningless in heaven
and indifferent in hell...

193
00:25:57,358 --> 00:26:00,944
Your stew stinks, what's it for?

194
00:26:00,945 --> 00:26:04,906
She was joined in flesh
with the Evil One.

195
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:09,411
- And now she's in the stocks.
- She will burn in the morning.

196
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:14,412
- But we must keep the Devil away.
- With that stinking brew?

197
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:19,129
The best stuff,
blood and guts of a big black dog.

198
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,967
The... The Evil One
can't bear the smell.

199
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:25,918
Me neither.

200
00:26:35,187 --> 00:26:38,148
Have you seen the Devil?

201
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:41,526
- Don't talk to her?
- Is it so dangerous?

202
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:46,527
I don't know, but she's seen as guilty
of the plague that has befallen us.

203
00:27:18,062 --> 00:27:23,062
Oh, fate is a reprobate
You my friend an unfortunate

204
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Now you bound in haste
Now worms lay you to waste

205
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:35,016
- Must you sing?
- No.

206
00:29:39,412 --> 00:29:43,624
Why do you look so surprised?
I steal from the dead.

207
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:48,625
It's quite a rewarding domain
these days.

208
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:54,217
You're thinking of telling tales
in the village? It won't help.

209
00:29:54,218 --> 00:29:59,218
Each one of us saves his own skin.
It's that simple.

210
00:30:00,725 --> 00:30:05,270
Don't try to scream. No one
will hear you, neither God nor man.

211
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:10,271
It's nothing to be surprised about.

212
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:17,282
I recognize you,
even though it was long ago.

213
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:21,036
You're Raval
from the seminary in Roskilde.

214
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:26,037
Doctor Mirabilis, Caelestis et Diabilis.
Am I not right?

215
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:33,294
You convinced my master to go to the
Holy Land on an honorable crusade.

216
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:42,387
Are you worried?
Butterflies in your belly?

217
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:47,558
Now I understand the meaning of
these 10 years that I thought wasted.

218
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:50,816
We had it too good,
we were too content.

219
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:54,653
The Lord wanted to punish
our self-satisfied pride.

220
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:59,654
He sent you to spit your heavenly
venom and to poison the knight.

221
00:31:00,034 --> 00:31:04,162
- It was in good faith.
- But now you know better, don't you?

222
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:09,163
Now you're a thief, a more suitable
occupation for wretches and villains.

223
00:31:11,462 --> 00:31:14,252
Am I not right?

224
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:20,721
By all means. I am not bloodthirsty.

225
00:31:20,722 --> 00:31:25,722
Next time I'll mark your face like we do
with petty villains of your kind.

226
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:32,979
I actually came
to fill my water bag.

227
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:44,160
Jöns is the name.
I'm a nice, talkative young man

228
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:49,161
who only thinks good thoughts
and commits honorable deeds.

229
00:31:55,672 --> 00:32:00,134
Farewell, my girl.
I could have raped you.

230
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:05,135
But between us, I'm tired of that
kind of love. It's dry in the long run.

231
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:14,227
When I think of it, I need
a housekeeper. Do you cook well?

232
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:19,653
I'm married, but I have hope
my wife will be dead by now.

233
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:23,914
So I need a housekeeper!

234
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:29,826
Come now and don't just stand there.
I saved you from death so you owe me!

235
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,281
Bloody hams!

236
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:54,893
Making a spectacle of themselves.

237
00:34:10,807 --> 00:34:15,217
Stop that, you tin-heads!

238
00:34:15,437 --> 00:34:20,274
I don't start
so I'll go behind the drape.

239
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:23,861
Stop staring, you blockheads!

240
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:28,862
The horse sits in the tree and crows

241
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:35,911
The road is wide but the door is low
The Black One dances on the beach

242
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:45,837
The hen meows in the darkest lake

243
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:56,348
The day is red but the fish is dead

244
00:34:56,478 --> 00:35:01,478
The Black One squats on the beach

245
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:08,944
The snake flutters in heaven's heights

246
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,286
The virgin is pale
but the pussy shows delight

247
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:19,287
The Black One runs on the beach

248
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:25,669
The ram hisses with teeth apart

249
00:35:31,972 --> 00:35:36,972
The gust is harsh and the waves dart

250
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:42,978
The Black One farts on the beach

251
00:35:45,318 --> 00:35:50,318
The horse sits in the tree and crows

252
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,786
The road is wide but the door is low

253
00:35:55,787 --> 00:36:00,787
The Black One dances on the beach

254
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:07,252
The hen meows in the darkest lake

255
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:17,762
The day is red but the fish is dead

256
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:22,851
The Black One squats on the beach

257
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:30,357
The snake flutters in heaven's heights

258
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:35,700
The virgin is pale
but the pussy shows delight

259
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:40,701
The Black One runs on the beach

260
00:36:41,707 --> 00:36:46,707
The sow lays and the cat sows

261
00:36:48,797 --> 00:36:52,592
Night is blighted and darkness glows

262
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:55,970
The Black One remains, remains

263
00:36:55,971 --> 00:37:00,971
Remains, remains on the beach

264
00:39:20,365 --> 00:39:24,368
God has sent
His punishment over us.

265
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:28,629
Yes! You will all vanish

266
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:32,681
by the Black Death.

267
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:37,882
You standing there
like open-mouthed cattle.

268
00:39:37,883 --> 00:39:42,261
And you sitting there
in bloated self-satisfaction.

269
00:39:42,262 --> 00:39:47,262
Do you know
that this could be your final hour?

270
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:53,409
Death stands behind you.

271
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:57,526
I can see the crown of his head
gleam in the sun.

272
00:39:57,527 --> 00:40:02,073
His scythe flashes when he raises it
behind your heads.

273
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:07,074
Who among you will he strike first?

274
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:10,623
You there, staring like a goat.

275
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:15,624
Before evening will your mouth be
distorted into a last, unfinished yawn?

276
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:23,298
And you, woman, blooming
with appetite and lust for life.

277
00:40:25,472 --> 00:40:30,472
Will you grow pale
and drop before the dawn?

278
00:40:31,937 --> 00:40:36,937
And you there,
with your swollen nose and silly grin.

279
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,318
Have you got a year left to pollute
the earth with your debris?

280
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:49,408
Do you know, you confirmed idiots,
that you are all going to die?

281
00:40:50,038 --> 00:40:54,208
Today, tomorrow, or the next day.
You are all condemned.

282
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:59,209
Do you hear what I say? Do you hear
the word? Condemned, condemned!

283
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:05,136
Lord, take pity on us
in our degradation.

284
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:08,389
Don't turn Your face
from us in contempt

285
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:13,390
but have mercy on us for the sake
of Your Son, Jesus Christ!

286
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:22,666
This bloody talk of doom. Is that
sustenance for a modern man?

287
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:28,089
Do they really think we'll take them
seriously? You laugh at me, Sire.

288
00:42:28,677 --> 00:42:33,677
I've read, heard and experienced
most stories we tell one another.

289
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:40,605
Even the ghost story of God,
Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit,

290
00:42:40,606 --> 00:42:45,606
I've absorbed
without much emotion.

291
00:42:46,153 --> 00:42:50,365
- Why are you shouting?
- I'm Plog and you're Jöns.

292
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:53,535
- That's possible.
- Have you seen my wife?

293
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:58,536
No, I haven't. But if I had, and she
resembled you, I'd be quick to forget.

294
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:06,423
- So, you haven't seen her?
- Maybe she's run away.

295
00:43:06,424 --> 00:43:10,009
- Do you know anything?
- Quite a lot, but not of your wife.

296
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:15,010
Go to the tavern
and you may find an answer.

297
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,200
It's true, the plague has swamped
the west coast. People die like flies.

298
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:43,914
Business is normally good at this
time of year, but my stock's unsold.

299
00:43:45,004 --> 00:43:50,004
They talk of the Last Day. And all
the omens certainly are terrible.

300
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:55,805
A woman gave birth to a calf’s head.

301
00:43:55,806 --> 00:44:00,101
People are crazy. They flee inland
and take the plague with them.

302
00:44:00,102 --> 00:44:05,102
If it's as they say, then we'll have
to enjoy life as long as we're standing.

303
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,695
Many people have cleaned
themselves by fire and died.

304
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:15,696
But the priest says it is better
to die clean than to live for hell.

305
00:44:16,285 --> 00:44:21,285
This is the end, that's what it is. We
all know it, but no one dares to say it.

306
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:26,753
This is the end.
People are crazy with fear.

307
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:31,466
- And you're scared too?
- Too right I'm scared!

308
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:34,844
Judgment Day
edges toward evening.

309
00:44:34,845 --> 00:44:39,845
The angels descend and the graves
open. It will be terrible to see.

310
00:44:45,314 --> 00:44:49,192
- I'll sell you this bracelet cheaply.
- I can't afford it.

311
00:44:49,193 --> 00:44:53,821
- It's genuine silver.
- It's nice, but probably too expensive.

312
00:44:53,822 --> 00:44:58,493
- Have you gentlemen seen my wife?
- Is she lost?

313
00:44:58,494 --> 00:45:02,372
She's run away, they say.
With an actor.

314
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:06,125
An actor?
If she has such bad taste, let her go.

315
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:11,126
You are absolutely right.
I was thinking I would kill her.

316
00:45:11,257 --> 00:45:16,257
- I see. Murder is another thing.
- I'm going to kill the actor, too.

317
00:45:16,845 --> 00:45:20,598
- The actor?
- The one she's run off with.

318
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:24,769
- What for?
- Are you thick?

319
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:29,770
Oh, the actor! Now I understand.
There are far too many of them.

320
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:34,988
Even if he's blameless,
you should kill him.

321
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:39,989
- Are you telling tales to him?
- Me? Am I telling tales?

322
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,040
You're also an actor and it's your
crony that's snuck off with his wife.

323
00:45:50,504 --> 00:45:53,798
Are you an actor as well?

324
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:57,719
Me, an actor? Not really.

325
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,014
Then we should kill you. It's logical.

326
00:46:02,015 --> 00:46:05,851
- You're funny.
- You've gone pale.

327
00:46:05,852 --> 00:46:10,852
- Something on your conscience?
- You're funny. Don't you think so?

328
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:18,401
Maybe we should mark you as one
does with petty villains of your kind.

329
00:46:19,866 --> 00:46:24,866
What have you done to my wife?

330
00:46:36,341 --> 00:46:40,177
Do you want to hurt me?
Why?

331
00:46:40,178 --> 00:46:45,178
Have I annoyed anyone or been in the
way? I'll leave and never come back.

332
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:52,060
Stand up so everyone can hear you.

333
00:46:53,316 --> 00:46:55,566
Speak louder.

334
00:46:56,486 --> 00:47:01,486
Stand on your head so we can see
whether you're a good actor.

335
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:16,876
What have you done to my wife?

336
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:21,051
- Don't whimper. Get up and dance.
- I can't. I won't.

337
00:47:21,052 --> 00:47:23,887
- Imitate a bear.
- I can't imitate a bear.

338
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:28,888
We'll see if you can anyway.

339
00:48:25,324 --> 00:48:30,324
- Get up. Be a good bear.
- I can't be a bear anymore.

340
00:48:47,722 --> 00:48:52,722
Remember what I'd do to you
if we met again?

341
00:48:53,311 --> 00:48:57,361
I'm a man of my word.

342
00:49:19,796 --> 00:49:23,548
- What's his name?
- Mikael.

343
00:49:23,549 --> 00:49:27,969
- How old is he?
- He's just over one year.

344
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:32,970
- He's big for his age.
- You think so? Yes, he is quite big.

345
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:38,601
- You were in a performance today.
- Did you think it was bad?

346
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:43,485
You're more beautiful without make-up.
That dress suits you better.

347
00:49:43,486 --> 00:49:48,486
You think so? Jonas Skat went
and left us, so now we're in a real fix.

348
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,829
- Is that your husband?
- Jonas? No.

349
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:58,208
- The other man is. His name is Jof.
- Oh, him.

350
00:49:58,209 --> 00:50:03,209
Now it's only me and him. We'll have
to do tricks again, and that's a bother.

351
00:50:03,923 --> 00:50:08,844
- Do you do tricks as well?
- Oh, yes. And Jof is a good juggler.

352
00:50:08,845 --> 00:50:12,973
- Will Mikael also be an acrobat?
- Jof wants him to be.

353
00:50:12,974 --> 00:50:16,226
- But not you?
- I don't know.

354
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:20,438
- Maybe he'll be a knight.
- It's not so much fun, I can tell you.

355
00:50:20,439 --> 00:50:23,692
- You don't look happy.
- No.

356
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:28,693
- Are you tired? Why?
- I have boring company.

357
00:50:29,156 --> 00:50:32,659
- Do you mean your squire?
- No, not him.

358
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,830
- Who do you mean, then?
- Myself.

359
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:40,750
- Oh, I understand.
- Do you really?

360
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:43,837
Yes, I understand quite well.

361
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:48,837
I often wonder why people torment
themselves as soon as they can.

362
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:54,509
- Mia...
- Jof... Jof, what is it?

363
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,599
Jof! Jof, what have you done?
Have you... Come and sit down.

364
00:51:01,897 --> 00:51:06,897
Where have you been?
Let me look at you.

365
00:51:11,406 --> 00:51:16,406
Why did you have to go to the tavern?
You drank, of course.

366
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:22,120
- I didn't drink a drop.
- You boasted about angels and devils.

367
00:51:22,959 --> 00:51:27,959
- People don't like too many ideas.
- I didn't mention angels.

368
00:51:28,048 --> 00:51:32,593
Then you sang and danced.
You always have to perform.

369
00:51:32,594 --> 00:51:36,472
- People get angry at that, too.
- Look at what...

370
00:51:36,473 --> 00:51:41,473
Look at what I bought for you.

371
00:51:44,439 --> 00:51:49,439
- You couldn’t afford that.
- Well, I did it anyway.

372
00:51:49,527 --> 00:51:50,327
Jof!

373
00:51:52,364 --> 00:51:57,364
- Oh, they gave me such a beating.
- Why didn't you give one back?

374
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:01,956
I just got scared and angry,
but never got that far.

375
00:52:01,957 --> 00:52:06,919
I got angry, believe me.
I roared like a lion.

376
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,920
- Did they get scared?
- No, they just laughed.

377
00:52:15,387 --> 00:52:17,937
Mikael. Mikael.

378
00:52:27,023 --> 00:52:29,817
- Smell how good he smells.
- And he's solid.

379
00:52:29,818 --> 00:52:34,818
You're a solid one, you are.
A real acrobat's body.

380
00:52:34,823 --> 00:52:39,083
This is my husband, Jof.

381
00:52:40,245 --> 00:52:42,830
- Good day.
- Good day.

382
00:52:42,831 --> 00:52:46,458
You have a fine son.
He will bring you joy.

383
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:51,213
Yes, he is lovely.
Do we have anything to offer, Mia?

384
00:52:51,214 --> 00:52:55,134
- Thanks, I shan't have anything.
- I picked wild strawberries.

385
00:52:55,135 --> 00:52:59,638
- And we actually milked some milk.
- Have milked...

386
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:03,475
If the knight would join us
it would be an honor.

387
00:53:03,476 --> 00:53:08,476
- Sit down and I'll bring the food.
- Please.

388
00:53:08,857 --> 00:53:12,151
- Where are you heading?
- To Elsinore.

389
00:53:12,152 --> 00:53:16,363
- I'd advise against a trip like that.
- Why, if I may ask?

390
00:53:16,364 --> 00:53:21,364
The plague is going down the coast.
People are dying in their ten thousands.

391
00:53:21,536 --> 00:53:26,536
- Trouble always brings his brother.
- Follow me through the woods.

392
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:32,417
You can stay at my estate or follow
the east coast. You'll be safer.

393
00:53:32,547 --> 00:53:32,963
They're wood strawberries.
They grow on the hill.

394
00:53:32,964 --> 00:53:35,799
They're wood strawberries.
They grow on the hill.

395
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,800
I never seen them so big.
Smell how fragrant they are.

396
00:53:42,182 --> 00:53:46,727
- Enjoy the fare.
- I thank you respectfully.

397
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:50,647
I think your suggestion is good,
but I must consider first.

398
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:53,776
It would be nice to have company
through the wood.

399
00:53:53,777 --> 00:53:58,280
It's full of ghosts, devils and thieves.
So I heard.

400
00:53:58,281 --> 00:54:01,950
I said it wasn't bad,
but I must consider it.

401
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:05,662
Since Skat left,
I'm responsible for the troupe.

402
00:54:05,663 --> 00:54:10,663
- I've become the manager, after all.
- "I've become the manager, after all."

403
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,552
- Would you like strawberries?
- That man saved my life.

404
00:54:20,553 --> 00:54:25,553
- Sit down and join us.
- The knight's Jöns conveys his thanks.

405
00:54:27,936 --> 00:54:31,313
- Oh, it's so nice.
- For a short while.

406
00:54:31,314 --> 00:54:36,151
Almost always.
One day is much like the next.

407
00:54:36,152 --> 00:54:40,531
Not so strange.
Summer is better than winter,

408
00:54:40,532 --> 00:54:45,452
because you don't freeze.
But spring is the very best.

409
00:54:45,453 --> 00:54:49,039
I wrote a poem about spring.
I'll fetch my lute.

410
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,460
Not now, Jof. Our guests might
not be entertained by your verses.

411
00:54:53,461 --> 00:54:56,713
- Please. I write songs myself.
- There you are.

412
00:54:56,714 --> 00:55:01,714
I have one about an unchaste fish
you may not have heard.

413
00:55:02,428 --> 00:55:04,304
You won't hear it, either.

414
00:55:04,305 --> 00:55:09,305
Some people don't appreciate my art
and I don't wish to torment anyone.

415
00:55:13,565 --> 00:55:18,152
- One worries so much.
- It's better when you are a couple.

416
00:55:18,153 --> 00:55:21,029
- Don't you have anyone?
- Yes.

417
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,324
- What is she doing now?
- I don't know.

418
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:28,245
You look so solemn.
Was she your sweetheart?

419
00:55:28,246 --> 00:55:33,246
We were newlyweds,
played together, laughed quite a lot.

420
00:55:33,626 --> 00:55:38,625
I wrote songs to her eyes, her nose,
her exquisite, small ears.

421
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:45,257
We went on hunts. In the evening
we danced. The house was full of life.

422
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:49,640
Would you like some strawberries?

423
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:52,727
Faith is a heavy burden,
do you know that?

424
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:57,728
It's like loving someone in the dark who
never comes, no matter how you call.

425
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:05,986
But all of that seems unreal when
I sit here with you and your husband.

426
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:11,162
It's suddenly insignificant.

427
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:15,333
Now you don't look so solemn.

428
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:20,334
I will remember this moment.
The stillness and the dusk.

429
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:26,089
The bowl of wild strawberries,
of milk.

430
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:29,764
Your faces in the evening light.

431
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:34,765
Mikael lying asleep,
Jof with his lute.

432
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:38,940
I will try and remember
what we spoke of.

433
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:42,985
And I will carry this memory
between my hands,

434
00:56:42,986 --> 00:56:47,986
as carefully as if it were a bowl
brimming with freshly milked milk.

435
00:56:53,622 --> 00:56:58,622
And this will be a sign for me,
and greatly fulfilling.

436
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,619
I have been waiting.

437
00:57:37,874 --> 00:57:41,168
Excuse me, I was somewhat delayed.

438
00:57:41,169 --> 00:57:45,172
As I've given away my strategy,
I will retreat.

439
00:57:45,173 --> 00:57:48,801
Go ahead. It's your move.

440
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:52,638
- Why do you look so pleased?
- That's my secret.

441
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:57,226
Naturally. I will take your knight now.

442
00:57:57,227 --> 00:58:00,467
You were right to.

443
00:58:00,897 --> 00:58:05,651
- Have you tricked me?
- Of course, you fell into the trap.

444
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:08,946
I put you in check.

445
00:58:08,947 --> 00:58:13,947
- What are you laughing at?
- No matter. Save your king instead.

446
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:19,244
- You are quite arrogant.
- Our game amuses me.

447
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:23,210
It's your move.
Be quick, I'm in a hurry.

448
00:58:23,211 --> 00:58:28,211
I know you are busy, but you won't
avoid our game. It will take its time.

449
00:58:29,509 --> 00:58:33,429
You're travelling with the jesters
through the woods?

450
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:38,430
The two called Jof and Mia,
who have a little son?

451
00:58:41,104 --> 00:58:43,894
Why do you ask?

452
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:46,575
No reason.

453
00:58:55,952 --> 00:58:56,160
- Have you seen Jöns? We must go.
- I believe he's in the inn.

454
00:58:56,161 --> 00:59:01,161
- Have you seen Jöns? We must go.
- I believe he's in the inn.

455
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:08,798
Good heavens.
If it isn't Plog the blacksmith.

456
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,759
- Evening.
- Are you sniveling all alone?

457
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,760
Yes, the blacksmith’s sobbing
and wailing like a soaked rabbit.

458
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:20,434
- Still the wife?
- Yes, I haven't found her.

459
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:23,813
Yes, it's hell with women
and hell without them.

460
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:27,316
Logical to kill them
when it's at its best.

461
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:31,862
- Henpecking and swills.
- Screaming babies and wet nappies.

462
00:59:31,863 --> 00:59:36,863
- Sharp nails and malice.
- The Devil’s aunt as mother-in-law.

463
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:41,288
- Then when you're going to sleep...
- Another tune.

464
00:59:41,289 --> 00:59:45,292
Tears, complaints
and laments by the sackfull.

465
00:59:45,293 --> 00:59:49,004
- "Why don't you kiss me?"
- "Why don't you sing?"

466
00:59:49,005 --> 00:59:53,843
- "Why don't you love me like before?"
- "Why don't you eye my new shift?"

467
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:57,555
- "You just turn your back and snore."
- Oh, hell...

468
00:59:57,556 --> 01:00:02,556
Oh, hell... She's gone now! Be happy!

469
01:00:04,729 --> 01:00:08,315
I'm going to pinch them
in the nose with my pliers.

470
01:00:08,316 --> 01:00:12,403
I'm going to pound them on the chest
with the little hammer.

471
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:17,404
I'm going to crack them lightly
on the head with the sledgehammer.

472
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:21,870
Look, he's blubbering again!

473
01:00:21,871 --> 01:00:25,832
- Maybe I love her.
- Maybe you love her?

474
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:30,378
Listen, you moron,
love is another word for lust,

475
01:00:30,379 --> 01:00:35,379
plus lust, plus lust, plus a lot of
deception, falsehoods and trickery.

476
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:41,260
- But it hurts anyway.
- Love is the blackest of all plagues.

477
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:47,020
If you died from it there'd be some joy.
But it almost always passes.

478
01:00:47,021 --> 01:00:51,774
- No, mine won't pass.
- Oh, yes, yours too!

479
01:00:51,775 --> 01:00:56,488
There are only a few poor dullards
now and then who die of love.

480
01:00:56,489 --> 01:01:01,489
If all is imperfect in this imperfect
world, then love is most imperfect

481
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:05,830
in its perfect imperfection.

482
01:01:05,831 --> 01:01:10,831
You're lucky to have such a fluid tongue
that you believe your own twaddle.

483
01:01:12,087 --> 01:01:15,882
Believe? Who said I did?
But I love giving good advice.

484
01:01:15,883 --> 01:01:20,470
Ask for one and you get two.
So I'm actually a learned chap.

485
01:01:20,471 --> 01:01:24,474
Jöns!
Can I follow you through the woods?

486
01:01:24,475 --> 01:01:29,475
I'm so lonely and don't want
to go home as they all laugh at me.

487
01:01:30,773 --> 01:01:34,651
As long as you don't sob all the time
or we'll leave you.

488
01:01:34,652 --> 01:01:35,732
Jöns!

489
01:01:46,705 --> 01:01:50,625
- My little brother...
- Watch out, Jöns!

490
01:01:50,626 --> 01:01:53,962
- He just wants to fight.
- He's sobbing now.

491
01:01:53,963 --> 01:01:58,963
I'm really sorry if I harmed you,
but I have such a temper.

492
01:02:00,052 --> 01:02:02,422
Take my hand.

493
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:09,435
- Let me embrace you, little brother.
- A little later, maybe.

494
01:02:09,436 --> 01:02:14,436
We're actually in a hurry. Thanks.

495
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:08,699
Ah, what do I see? Who is it looms
out of the edge of the forest

496
01:03:10,372 --> 01:03:15,372
if not My Most Treasured
with attached actor!

497
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,316
Watch out!

498
01:03:38,317 --> 01:03:43,317
You must be the dirty blacksmith
that humiliated my beloved Kunigunda.

499
01:03:45,282 --> 01:03:50,282
- What did you say her name was?
- Kunigunda. Are you deaf?

500
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:55,500
Her name's Lisa.
Lisa Daft or Sloven or Tart.

501
01:03:55,501 --> 01:04:00,254
- Drawerless Hussy or Arse Lisa.
- Goodness, he's base!

502
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:05,255
Just good at sleaze, not unlike
yourself, you gilded bawd-pudding.

503
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:09,097
- Oh, he's base!
- You awful, cropped bastard

504
01:04:09,098 --> 01:04:12,892
of seven mangy mongrels,
if I were in your infested rags,

505
01:04:12,893 --> 01:04:16,771
I'd be afflicted
by such boundless shame

506
01:04:16,772 --> 01:04:21,651
that I'd free nature from
my embarrassing countenance.

507
01:04:21,652 --> 01:04:26,652
- Watch out, you perfumed...
- "Powder-puff."

508
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:31,411
...powder-puff,
that I don't let off a fart

509
01:04:31,412 --> 01:04:36,412
that will assign you
to the juggler’s inferno in a flash,

510
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:39,961
- where you can sit together and...
- "Read soliloquies."

511
01:04:39,962 --> 01:04:44,962
...read soliloquies to one another
until dust forms in the Devil’s ears.

512
01:04:45,926 --> 01:04:50,926
Careful I don't poke your belly
so your intestines flow out your ears.

513
01:04:51,724 --> 01:04:56,724
Careful I don't smack you so you can't
even play for Turks and cannibals.

514
01:04:59,106 --> 01:05:02,024
What are you laughing at?
This is serious.

515
01:05:02,025 --> 01:05:06,529
In southern lands there is a man-like
animal called an ape.

516
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:09,030
- What of it?
- Just that.

517
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:13,891
- Plog, my only Plog.
- What?

518
01:05:14,454 --> 01:05:18,457
- What?
- Darling Plog, forgive me everything.

519
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:23,458
- She'll start crying in a minute.
- I have to cry. It's awful.

520
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:28,341
That man deceived me so badly,
you won't believe.

521
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:33,342
- Kunigunda, if we're going to tell the truth...
- And now for his favorite dishes.

522
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:38,643
Plog, when we get home
I'll make dumplings for you

523
01:05:38,644 --> 01:05:43,315
with mashed turnips and lingonberries,
which is your favorite.

524
01:05:43,316 --> 01:05:48,316
- Isn't that so, Plog?
- Yes, but I have to kill him first.

525
01:05:49,155 --> 01:05:53,074
Yes, kill him.
Kill him really properly.

526
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:58,075
- I don't like him at all anymore.
- God, why did you give us woman?

527
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:02,501
You know what he is?
Just a false beard, false teeth,

528
01:06:02,502 --> 01:06:06,463
false smiles, rehearsed intonation
and empty as a jar.

529
01:06:06,464 --> 01:06:11,259
- Go ahead and kill him.
- My dear Plog...

530
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:15,639
If you thought I'd defend
my so-called reality you're mistaken.

531
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:20,640
- Kill me. I'll thank you. Afterwards.
- What are you saying?

532
01:06:20,853 --> 01:06:24,523
He's created confusion.
Already a half-victory.

533
01:06:24,524 --> 01:06:29,524
- Do something, don't just stand there!
- He has to fight or I can't kill him.

534
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:33,532
He has to provoke me
so I get angry like before.

535
01:06:33,533 --> 01:06:38,078
Dear friend,
I lower this dagger to my breast.

536
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,874
And my reality will quickly transform
into a new, solid reality.

537
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:45,544
The absolute manifestation
of the corpse.

538
01:06:45,545 --> 01:06:49,756
Wait... I didn't mean it like that.

539
01:06:49,757 --> 01:06:54,757
I forgive you, Kunigunda. Farewell,
my friend, pray for me sometime.

540
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:15,198
Oh, dear... Oh, dear...

541
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:19,452
I didn't mean it like that.
I started to really like him.

542
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:24,453
He's absolutely dead. I've almost
never seen such a dead actor.

543
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:29,087
It's really sad, although he
wanted it himself, poor thing.

544
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:34,088
- And I'm married to her...
- Well, you got your little Lisa back.

545
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:40,511
- Aren't you happy?
- Jöns, in the strictest confidence...

546
01:07:40,933 --> 01:07:45,933
- Isn't life quite...
- Yes, it is. But don't think about it.

547
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:53,065
It's mad, that's what it is.

548
01:07:59,035 --> 01:08:04,035
That was a good performance.
I'm nothing if not a good actor.

549
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:11,713
I'll find a tree and climb it.

550
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:16,714
So no bears, wolves or ghosts
can get hold of me.

551
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:40,529
I'll find Jof and Mia tomorrow, then
we'll go to the All Saints Festival.

552
01:08:42,954 --> 01:08:45,163
I'll sing a song to myself.

553
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:50,164
I'm a little bird who sings how I want

554
01:08:51,671 --> 01:08:56,671
Craftsmen in the forest. How nice.

555
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,848
By God, it's my tree
they're sawing down!

556
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:08,728
Hey, you dozy cockerel!
What are you doing to my tree?

557
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:13,729
Can't you answer?
Courtesy is cheap. Who are you?

558
01:09:14,485 --> 01:09:18,405
I'm sawing down your tree
as your time is up.

559
01:09:18,406 --> 01:09:23,406
- It's not possible. I don't have time.
- Haven't you got time?

560
01:09:23,995 --> 01:09:28,995
- I've got a performance.
- It's cancelled. Because of a death.

561
01:09:29,709 --> 01:09:33,879
- My contract!
- Annulled.

562
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:38,921
- My family and my children...
- Shame on you, Skat!

563
01:09:39,135 --> 01:09:42,721
I am ashamed, I'm ashamed...

564
01:09:42,722 --> 01:09:47,722
Aren't there any acquittals?
Any special rules for actors?

565
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:51,688
No, not in this case.

566
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:56,428
No loopholes, no exceptions?

567
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:44,031
The moon just came out
from behind the clouds.

568
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:47,534
Good. We'll see the road better.

569
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:52,535
- I don't like the moon tonight.
- The trees are so still.

570
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:57,707
- That's because there isn't any wind.
- He means they are very still.

571
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:03,258
It's completely quiet.

572
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:07,012
- If we at least heard a fox.
- Or an owl.

573
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:12,013
Or a human voice.
Beside one's own.

574
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,507
- Where are you going?
- To the stake.

575
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:48,262
I see, it's the witch. Why burn her
in the middle of the night?

576
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:53,225
- People lack amusement nowadays.
- Quiet, by all the dev... Saints.

577
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:58,226
- She has the Devil with her.
- Then you men are eight brave men.

578
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:03,356
Well, we're paid.
The task was voluntary.

579
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:43,874
Do you hear me?

580
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:49,549
- They say you worked with the Devil.
- Why do you ask that?

581
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:54,550
Not out of curiosity,
but for highly personal reasons.

582
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:59,931
- I also want to meet him.
- Why?

583
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:03,522
I want to ask him about God.

584
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:08,353
He must know. He if anyone.

585
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:13,323
- You can see him when you want.
- How?

586
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:18,203
But then you must do as I say.

587
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:21,444
Look into my eyes.

588
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:27,421
Well? What do you see?
Do you see him?

589
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:32,422
I see a rigid fear in your eyes.

590
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,219
Nothing else.

591
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:41,039
No one, nothing... No one...

592
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,235
No.

593
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:49,771
Isn't he standing
behind your back either?

594
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:54,478
No. There's nothing here.

595
01:14:57,117 --> 01:15:02,117
But he's with me everywhere. I only
need to put out my hand and I feel his.

596
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:07,710
He is with me now as well.
The fire won't hurt me.

597
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:10,880
- Has he said so?
- I know.

598
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:15,881
I know, I know. You must see
him somewhere, you must!

599
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:20,348
The priest had no trouble seeing him,
nor the troops.

600
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:25,349
They're so scared of him
they don't even dare to touch me.

601
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,735
- Why have you crushed her hands?
- It's not us.

602
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:37,736
- Who?
- Ask the monk over there.

603
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:43,325
What have you done to the girl?

604
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:49,210
Do you never cease asking?

605
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:52,451
No. I never cease.

606
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:58,799
But you don't get any answer.

607
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:18,402
I thought about killing the guard,
but it doesn't help. She's almost dead.

608
01:16:18,573 --> 01:16:23,573
I told you to watch out!
Don't go near to her.

609
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:37,963
Eat this and the pain will go.

610
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:41,322
- What's she see? Can you answer?
- She's not in pain anymore.

611
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:45,910
You're not answering my question.
Who will take care of that child?

612
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:50,911
Is it the angels or God or Satan
or just emptiness?

613
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:54,502
- Emptiness, Sire.
- It can't be so!

614
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:59,503
Look at her eyes. Her poor
consciousness is perceiving something.

615
01:17:59,799 --> 01:18:03,636
- Emptiness under the moon.
- No.

616
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:08,224
We stand powerless with hanging
arms, as we see what she sees.

617
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:11,435
Our fear and hers are the same.

618
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:16,436
That little child... I can't be
bothered, I can't be bothered...

619
01:19:31,223 --> 01:19:36,185
He sings so beautifully of Jesus Christ

620
01:19:36,186 --> 01:19:41,166
There is great joy in heaven

621
01:19:42,693 --> 01:19:47,693
The dawn will break soon.
Yet the heat hangs like a damp blanket.

622
01:19:48,949 --> 01:19:51,589
I'm so scared.

623
01:19:52,036 --> 01:19:57,036
We feel something is going to happen
to us, but we don't know what it is.

624
01:19:57,625 --> 01:20:02,625
- Maybe the final day.
- The final day.

625
01:20:10,721 --> 01:20:15,721
Haven't you got any water?
Can you give me some water?

626
01:20:17,811 --> 01:20:22,811
- I've got the plague.
- Keep to the other side of the stump!

627
01:20:27,988 --> 01:20:32,988
I'm scared of dying.
I don't want to die, I don't want to!

628
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:43,999
Can't you take pity on me? Help me...

629
01:20:44,004 --> 01:20:47,664
At least talk to me!

630
01:20:52,388 --> 01:20:57,183
It doesn't help. It doesn't help.

631
01:20:57,184 --> 01:21:02,184
I know it doesn't help at all.

632
01:21:03,524 --> 01:21:08,524
I'm going to die. I... I...

633
01:21:11,323 --> 01:21:16,323
What's going to happen to me?
Can't you even comfort me?

634
01:21:17,037 --> 01:21:22,037
Haven't you got any mercy?
Can't you see that I...

635
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:27,588
Is there no help?
Can't I have any water?

636
01:21:27,589 --> 01:21:32,589
It's meaningless.
It's completely meaningless.

637
01:21:32,594 --> 01:21:35,847
I said, it's meaningless.

638
01:21:35,848 --> 01:21:40,848
- Help me!
- Can't you hear I'm comforting you?

639
01:22:06,378 --> 01:22:11,378
- Shall we conclude our game?
- It's your move.

640
01:22:19,558 --> 01:22:24,558
- I took your queen.
- I didn't see that.

641
01:22:37,075 --> 01:22:42,075
Mia... I see something terrible,
something almost unspeakable.

642
01:22:43,123 --> 01:22:46,876
- What do you see?
- The knight is playing chess.

643
01:22:46,877 --> 01:22:51,506
- I see that too. It's not so terrible.
- You see who he's playing with?

644
01:22:51,507 --> 01:22:56,507
- He's alone. Don't scare me like that.
- No, no. He's not alone.

645
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:02,179
- Who is it?
- Death. He's playing Death himself.

646
01:23:03,018 --> 01:23:07,396
- Don't say that.
- We must try and get away.

647
01:23:07,397 --> 01:23:09,565
- We can't.
- We must try.

648
01:23:09,566 --> 01:23:14,566
They're so engrossed in their game,
if we leave quietly they won't notice.

649
01:23:19,743 --> 01:23:24,743
It's your move, Antonius Block.

650
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:31,625
- Have you lost interest in our game?
- Lost interest? On the contrary.

651
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,800
You look anxious.
Are you concealing something?

652
01:23:40,305 --> 01:23:45,305
- Nothing escapes you. Isn't that so?
- Nothing escapes me.

653
01:23:45,727 --> 01:23:50,727
- No one escapes me.
- It is true I'm anxious.

654
01:23:52,526 --> 01:23:55,196
You are scared.

655
01:24:02,619 --> 01:24:07,206
I forget where the pieces were.

656
01:24:07,207 --> 01:24:10,751
But I haven't forgotten.

657
01:24:10,752 --> 01:24:15,751
You won't get away that easily.

658
01:24:22,513 --> 01:24:27,513
- I see something interesting now.
- What do you see?

659
01:24:27,518 --> 01:24:32,518
You will be checkmate
in the next move.

660
01:24:33,691 --> 01:24:35,911
That's true.

661
01:24:37,111 --> 01:24:42,111
- Did you profit from your respite?
- Yes, I did.

662
01:24:42,283 --> 01:24:47,283
That pleases me. I will leave you now.

663
01:24:48,205 --> 01:24:53,205
When we meet again you and your
entourage's time will be over.

664
01:24:56,547 --> 01:25:01,547
- And you'll reveal your secrets?
- I carry no secrets.

665
01:25:02,178 --> 01:25:05,718
So you know nothing?

666
01:25:05,806 --> 01:25:08,476
I am unknowing.

667
01:25:30,623 --> 01:25:35,623
- Do you see that strange light?
- It's the storm coming with the dawn.

668
01:25:36,462 --> 01:25:40,840
It's something else, something
terrible. You hear the rumbling?

669
01:25:40,841 --> 01:25:45,512
- It's probably the rain.
- No, it's not the rain.

670
01:25:45,513 --> 01:25:50,513
He's seen us, followed us,
he's caught up to us, he's coming at us!

671
01:26:03,823 --> 01:26:08,823
Get in the wagon, Mia.
Let's get in, quickly!

672
01:26:12,456 --> 01:26:16,668
It's the angel of death passing by,
Mia. The angel of death.

673
01:26:16,669 --> 01:26:21,669
- And he's very big...
- Do you feel how cold it is?

674
01:28:24,713 --> 01:28:29,713
I heard from returning crusaders
that you were on your way home.

675
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:34,760
I've waited for you.
All the others have fled the plague.

676
01:28:40,771 --> 01:28:45,771
Don't you recognize me anymore?

677
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:51,610
You've also changed.

678
01:28:57,705 --> 01:29:01,582
Now I can see it's you.

679
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:05,502
Somewhere in your eyes...

680
01:29:05,503 --> 01:29:10,503
Somewhere in your face,
but hidden and frightened,

681
01:29:12,343 --> 01:29:17,343
is that boy that set off
all those years ago.

682
01:29:18,474 --> 01:29:23,474
It's over now and I'm a little tired.

683
01:29:23,605 --> 01:29:27,941
- Do you regret your journey?
- No.

684
01:29:27,942 --> 01:29:32,942
I don't regret anything.
But I'm a little tired.

685
01:29:37,493 --> 01:29:39,713
I can see...

686
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:51,110
My friends are there.

687
01:29:52,967 --> 01:29:57,967
Ask them to come in.
I'll set the table for breakfast.

688
01:30:01,893 --> 01:30:06,480
"And when the Lamb
opened the seventh seal,

689
01:30:06,481 --> 01:30:10,275
"there was in heaven a silence

690
01:30:10,276 --> 01:30:14,529
"which lasted about the space
of half an hour.

691
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:19,530
"And the seven angels
who had the seven trumpets

692
01:30:20,203 --> 01:30:25,203
"prepared themselves to sound.

693
01:30:36,219 --> 01:30:40,359
"The first angel sounded

694
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:44,893
"and there followed hail and fire
mingled with blood,

695
01:30:44,894 --> 01:30:48,689
"and they were cast upon the earth.

696
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:53,485
"And the third part of the earth
was burnt up,

697
01:30:53,486 --> 01:30:58,486
"and the third part of trees
was burnt up,

698
01:30:58,574 --> 01:31:03,574
"and all green grass
was burnt up.

699
01:31:03,871 --> 01:31:08,871
"And the second angel sounded,

700
01:31:09,085 --> 01:31:13,171
"and as it were a great mountain
burning with fire

701
01:31:13,172 --> 01:31:16,258
"was cast into the sea.

702
01:31:16,259 --> 01:31:20,804
"And the third part of the sea
became blood."

703
01:31:20,805 --> 01:31:24,795
Was there anyone there?

704
01:31:28,062 --> 01:31:32,292
No, Sire. I saw no one.

705
01:31:34,861 --> 01:31:39,861
"And the third angel sounded,

706
01:31:41,034 --> 01:31:45,912
"and there fell a great star
from heaven

707
01:31:45,913 --> 01:31:50,083
"burning as it were a lamp.

708
01:31:50,084 --> 01:31:55,084
"And the name of the star
is called Wormwood."

709
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:34,482
Good day, noble Sire.

710
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:39,670
I am Karin, wife of the knight. I bid
you a courteous welcome to my home.

711
01:32:42,929 --> 01:32:47,929
I am a blacksmith by trade
and quite good if I say so myself.

712
01:32:49,185 --> 01:32:54,185
My wife, Lisa.
Curtsey for the honorable Sire, Lisa.

713
01:32:56,109 --> 01:33:00,570
She's a little difficult at times
and we've had a little affray

714
01:33:00,571 --> 01:33:04,282
but no worse than most people.

715
01:33:04,283 --> 01:33:09,283
In our darkness we call out to you, Lord.
Oh, God, have mercy on us.

716
01:33:11,332 --> 01:33:14,876
For we are small,
afraid and without knowledge.

717
01:33:14,877 --> 01:33:19,877
In that darkness where you claim to
reside, where we probably all reside,

718
01:33:20,049 --> 01:33:25,049
you'll find no one that listens to your
complaint or is moved by your suffering.

719
01:33:25,596 --> 01:33:30,596
- Dry your tears, mirror your apathy.
- God, you that exist somewhere,

720
01:33:31,769 --> 01:33:36,565
that must exist somewhere,
have mercy on us.

721
01:33:36,566 --> 01:33:41,528
I had an herb to purge your anxiety
over the eternal. Now it's too late.

722
01:33:41,529 --> 01:33:46,528
Feel in this final minute the triumph of
rolling your eyes and moving your toes.

723
01:33:46,867 --> 01:33:51,867
- Quiet... Quiet.
- I'll be quiet, but under protest!

724
01:34:13,852 --> 01:34:16,522
It is finished.

725
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:12,660
Mia! I can see them, Mia.

726
01:35:12,661 --> 01:35:17,581
I can see them.
Over there under the storm-laden skies.

727
01:35:17,582 --> 01:35:21,877
They're all there.
The blacksmith and Lisa,

728
01:35:21,878 --> 01:35:25,589
the knight and Raval, Jöns and Skat...

729
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:30,386
And the grim master, Death,
invites them to dance.

730
01:35:30,387 --> 01:35:35,387
He wants them to hold hands
and dance in a long line.

731
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:41,605
And the grim master leads
with scythe and hourglass.

732
01:35:41,606 --> 01:35:46,527
Skat brings up the rear with his lyre.

733
01:35:46,528 --> 01:35:50,864
They move away,
away from the dawn,

734
01:35:50,865 --> 01:35:55,865
in a solemn dance,
away to the dark country.

735
01:35:56,454 --> 01:36:00,332
Whilst the rain
washes over their faces,

736
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:05,333
cleans their cheeks of tears of salt.

737
01:36:08,216 --> 01:36:13,216
You and your dreams and visions...
