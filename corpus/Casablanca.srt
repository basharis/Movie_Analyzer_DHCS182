1
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:13,063
<i>With the coming
of the Second World War...</i>

2
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:18,068
<i>... many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully or desperately...</i>

3
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:20,320
<i>... toward the freedom of the Americas.</i>

4
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:23,156
<i>Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.</i>

5
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:26,410
<i>But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.</i>

6
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:30,747
<i>And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.</i>

7
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:33,875
<i>Paris to Marseilles.</i>

8
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:42,426
<i>Across the Mediterranean to Oran.</i>

9
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:53,728
<i>Then by train or auto or foot
across the rim of Africa...</i>

10
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,565
<i>... to Casablanca in French Morocco.</i>

11
00:01:56,857 --> 00:02:01,403
<i>Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...</i>

12
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:05,198
<i>... might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.</i>

13
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:07,617
<i>And from Lisbon to the New World.</i>

14
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:11,663
<i>But the others wait in Casablanca.</i>

15
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:13,331
<i>And wait...</i>

16
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,208
<i>... and wait...</i>

17
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:17,043
<i>... and wait.</i>

18
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:28,388
"To all officers:

19
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:33,477
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

20
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:36,646
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

21
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:40,859
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

22
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:42,444
Important."

23
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:15,685
May we see your papers?

24
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,562
I don't have them on me.

25
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:19,981
In that case,
you'll have to come along.

26
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,777
It's possible that I...
Yes. Here they are.

27
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,242
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

28
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:33,412
Halt!

29
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:01,022
- What is going on?
- I don't know, my dear.

30
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:03,650
Pardon me. Have you not heard?

31
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,570
We hear very little
and we understand even less.

32
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,574
Two German couriers were found
murdered in the unoccupied desert.

33
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:13,577
This is the customary
roundup of refugees, liberals...

34
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,997
...and beautiful girls for Mr. Renault,
the prefect of police.

35
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:25,672
With these refugees, the scum
of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.

36
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:28,300
Some have been waiting
years for a visa.

37
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:31,803
I beg of you, monsieur.
Watch yourself. Be on guard.

38
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,972
This place is full of vultures.

39
00:04:34,264 --> 00:04:37,017
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere.

40
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:39,895
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

41
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:43,774
Amusing little fellow.

42
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:45,275
Waiter.

43
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,445
- How silly of me.
- What, dear?

44
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,281
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

45
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,091
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

46
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:38,203
It is good to see you,
Maj. Strasser.

47
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:39,538
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,707
May I present Capt. Renault,
the police prefect.

49
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:46,211
Unoccupied France welcomes you.

50
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,338
Thank you, it's good to be here.

51
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:51,341
Maj. Strasser, my aide,
Lt. Casselle.

52
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:55,303
- Capt. Tonelli, the Italian service...
- That is kind of you.

53
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:04,604
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

54
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:08,525
We Germans must get used to all
climates, from Russia to the Sahara.

55
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:11,695
- But you're not referring to the weather.
- What else?

56
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,947
What's been done about the murders?

57
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:18,034
My men are rounding up twice
the usual number of suspects.

58
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:21,246
- But we know who the murderer is.
- Good. Is he in custody?

59
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:24,374
Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

60
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:28,336
I've already heard about this café.
Also about Mr. Rick himself.

61
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:07,334
<i>For nobody else
Gave me a thrill</i>

62
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:10,253
<i>Honey, with all your faults
I love you still</i>

63
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:12,923
<i>It had to Be You, wonderful you</i>

64
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:15,050
<i>It had to be you</i>

65
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:19,805
<i>'Cause my hair is curly</i>

66
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,103
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

67
00:07:26,353 --> 00:07:28,355
I'll never get out of here.

68
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,273
I'll die in Casablanca.

69
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:33,860
But can't you make it
just a little more, please?

70
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:37,197
Sorry, but diamonds are
a drag on the market.

71
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:39,991
There are diamonds everywhere.
Twenty-four hundred.

72
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,243
All right.

73
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:45,288
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything...

74
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,252
<i>It's the fishing smack Santiago.</i>

75
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,506
It leaves at one tomorrow night.
From the end of the marina.

76
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:55,632
Thank you.

77
00:07:55,882 --> 00:07:58,427
And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

78
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:00,929
Remember, in cash.

79
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:09,312
Cheerio.

80
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,482
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

81
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:23,285
- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?

82
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:26,079
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

83
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:30,375
Madame, he never drinks with customers.
Never. I've never seen it.

84
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,753
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

85
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:36,798
Perhaps if you told him I ran
the second-largest bank in Amsterdam.

86
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:39,718
The second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

87
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,305
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef here.

88
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:46,141
We have something to look forward to.

89
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:49,561
And his father is the bellboy.

90
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,604
Good!

91
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:20,967
Excuse me.

92
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,514
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

93
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:29,684
Of all the nerve! Who do you think...
I know there is gambling in there!

94
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,019
You dare not keep me out!

95
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:32,521
What's the trouble?

96
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:35,690
I have been in every gambling room
from Honolulu to Berlin.

97
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:39,820
If you think I'll be kept out
of a saloon like this, you're mistaken.

98
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,987
Excuse me, please.

99
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:42,030
Hello, Rick.

100
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:46,576
Your cash is good at the bar.

101
00:09:46,993 --> 00:09:48,620
What? Do you know who I am?

102
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:50,914
I do. You're lucky
the bar is open to you.

103
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:54,251
<i>This is outrageous!
I shall report it to the angriff!</i>

104
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,299
Watching you now, one would think
you've been doing this all your life.

105
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:04,219
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

106
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:08,598
- But when you first came, I thought...
- You thought what?

107
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:11,268
What right do I have to think?

108
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:17,607
May I?

109
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:21,153
Too bad about those two
German couriers.

110
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:23,989
They got lucky.
Yesterday, they were just clerks.

111
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:26,908
Today, they're the honored dead.

112
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,495
You're a very cynical person.
Forgive me for saying so.

113
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:31,538
I forgive you.

114
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:33,623
Will you have a drink with me?

115
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:37,002
I forgot you never drink with...
I'll have another, please.

116
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:39,671
You despise me, don't you?

117
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:42,007
If I gave you any thought,
I would.

118
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:43,550
But why?

119
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:47,095
You object to the kind
of business I do, huh?

120
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:51,975
But think of all those poor refugees
who must rot here if I didn't help them.

121
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:56,563
That's not so bad. Through ways of
my own, I provide them with exit visas.

122
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:59,232
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

123
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:03,570
Think of the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

124
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:06,990
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

125
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:10,118
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

126
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:14,456
After tonight, I'll be through
with the whole business.

127
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:17,209
And I'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

128
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:20,670
Who'd you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

129
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:24,382
Myself. I found myself
much more reasonable.

130
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:25,884
Look, Rick.

131
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,261
You know what this is?

132
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:31,515
Something that even you
have never seen.

133
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:34,810
Letters of transit
signed by General de Gaulle.

134
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,063
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

135
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:39,314
One moment.

136
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:43,693
Tonight, I'll be selling those for
more money than even I ever dreamed of.

137
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:46,029
<i>And then, addio, Casablanca.</i>

138
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,200
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but just because you despise me...

139
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,202
...you are the only one I trust.

140
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,162
Will you keep these for me?

141
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:57,040
- For how long?
- An hour. Perhaps a little longer.

142
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,625
I don't want them overnight.

143
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,878
Don't be afraid of that.
Please keep them for me.

144
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:04,214
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

145
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:06,758
Waiter,
I'll be expecting some people.

146
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,554
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

147
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:12,013
Rick...

148
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:14,975
...I hope you're more
impressed with me now.

149
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:18,562
I'll share my good luck
with your roulette wheel.

150
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:20,313
Just a moment.

151
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,237
I heard a rumor those German couriers
were carrying letters of transit.

152
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:31,199
I've heard that rumor too.

153
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:33,952
- Poor devils.
- You're right, Ugarte.

154
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:37,664
I am a little more impressed with you.

155
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,926
<i>- Say, who 's got trouble?
- We got trouble</i>

156
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:52,012
<i>- How much trouble?
- Too much trouble</i>

157
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:56,683
<i>Well now, don 't you frown
Just knuckle down and knock on wood</i>

158
00:12:58,185 --> 00:13:00,437
<i>- Who 's unhappy?
- We're unhappy</i>

159
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:03,398
<i>- How unhappy?
- Too unhappy</i>

160
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:07,235
<i>That won 't do
When you are blue, just knock on wood</i>

161
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:13,450
<i>- How unlucky?
- Too unlucky</i>

162
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,788
<i>But your luck'll change
If you'll arrange to knock on wood</i>

163
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,583
<i>- Who 's got nothing?
- We got nothing</i>

164
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:43,396
<i>- Now who 's lucky?
- We're all lucky</i>

165
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:45,524
<i>- Just how lucky?
- Very lucky</i>

166
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:48,276
<i>Well, smile up, then
And once again</i>

167
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:51,571
<i>Let's knock on wood</i>

168
00:13:58,412 --> 00:13:59,830
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

169
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,289
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

170
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:04,418
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

171
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:07,587
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

172
00:14:07,838 --> 00:14:11,299
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

173
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:13,677
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

174
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:17,848
In refugees alone, we can make
a fortune together in the black market.

175
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:20,642
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

176
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:23,770
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

177
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,855
Suppose we do.

178
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:30,318
When will you realize that in this world
isolationism is not a practical policy?

179
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,904
Ferrari wants you to work
for him at the Blue Parrot.

180
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,322
I like it fine here.

181
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:38,368
- He'll double what I pay you.
- But I ain't got time to spend money.

182
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:39,911
Sorry.

183
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:47,544
The boss's private stock.
Because, Yvonne, I love you.

184
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:48,587
Shut up.

185
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:53,425
All right. For you, I shut up.
Because, Yvonne, I love you.

186
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:57,179
Monsieur Rick.

187
00:14:57,554 --> 00:15:00,724
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

188
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:06,563
Where were you last night?

189
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:09,274
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

190
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:13,236
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

191
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:15,447
Give me another.

192
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:18,283
- She's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

193
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,702
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

194
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:23,455
- I'm tired of having you...
- Sascha, call a cab.

195
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:25,707
- We'll get your coat.
- Take your hands off!

196
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,627
You're going home.
You've had too much to drink.

197
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:32,839
Hey, taxi!

198
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:35,717
Who do you think you are,
pushing me?

199
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:37,677
What a fool I was
to fall for you.

200
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:40,263
- Go with her. Be sure she gets home.
- Yes, boss.

201
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:41,306
Come right back.

202
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:43,058
Yes, boss.

203
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,446
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

204
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:58,740
How extravagant,
throwing away women like that.

205
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:00,826
Someday, they may be scarce.

206
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:04,996
I think I shall pay a call on Yvonne.
Maybe get her on the rebound.

207
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:07,582
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

208
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:21,012
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

209
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:26,685
The plane to Lisbon.

210
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:33,066
You would like to be on it?

211
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:34,901
Why? What's in Lisbon?

212
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:37,112
The clipper to America.

213
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:40,073
I've speculated on why
you don't return to America.

214
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:44,411
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Run off with a senator's wife?

215
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:47,330
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

216
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:49,207
It's a combination of all three.

217
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,126
What brought you to Casablanca?

218
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:54,546
My health. I came
to Casablanca for the waters.

219
00:16:54,755 --> 00:16:58,300
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

220
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:00,343
I was misinformed.

221
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:03,972
Excuse me, Rick.

222
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:07,392
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

223
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:10,020
...and the cashier
would like some money.

224
00:17:11,354 --> 00:17:14,274
- I'll get it from the safe.
- I'm so upset. You know...

225
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:17,069
Forget it, Emil.
Mistakes happen all the time.

226
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:18,987
I'm awfully sorry.

227
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:27,913
There'll be some excitement tonight.
An arrest in your café.

228
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:30,123
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

229
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:31,750
A murderer, no less.

230
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,962
If you're thinking of warning him,
don't. He cannot escape.

231
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:40,258
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

232
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:45,931
We could've arrested him
at the Blue Parrot.

233
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:48,433
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

234
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:50,102
It will amuse your customers.

235
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,813
Our entertainment's enough.

236
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:58,402
We'll have an important guest tonight.
Maj. Strasser, of the Third Reich.

237
00:17:58,652 --> 00:18:03,031
We want him to see the arrest as a
demonstration of our efficiency.

238
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:05,283
I see.
What's Strasser doing here?

239
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:09,287
He didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

240
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:10,705
- Perhaps not.
- Here you are.

241
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:12,999
- It won't happen again.
- That's all right.

242
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,086
Louis, there's something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it?

243
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:17,712
How observant you are.

244
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:20,632
I wanted to give you
a word of advice.

245
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:22,050
Yeah?

246
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:24,553
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

247
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:29,933
There are exit visas sold in this café,
but we know you've never sold one.

248
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,269
That's why we let you remain open.

249
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,521
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

250
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,356
That is another reason.

251
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:39,276
There's a man arrived here
on his way to America.

252
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:42,362
He'll offer a fortune to anyone
who'll get him a visa.

253
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:45,115
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

254
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:46,742
Victor Laszlo?

255
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,286
That's the first time
I've seen you impressed.

256
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:51,663
He's succeeded
in impressing half the world.

257
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:54,249
It's my duty to see
he doesn't impress the other half.

258
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:58,628
Rick, Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

259
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,797
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

260
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:02,132
Manages what?

261
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:03,175
His escape.

262
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,177
- But I just told you...
- Stop it.

263
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:08,930
He escaped the concentration camp.
Nazis have chased him through Europe.

264
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,599
This is the end of the chase.

265
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:14,728
- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
- Is that a serious offer?

266
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:17,439
I just paid 20.
I'd like to get it back.

267
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:20,400
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor, corrupt official.

268
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:22,444
- Okay.
- Done.

269
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:26,698
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs a visa. Or, I should say, two.

270
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:29,117
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

271
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:31,995
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen her.

272
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:35,165
If he did not leave her
in Marseilles or in Oran...

273
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,501
...he won't leave her in Casablanca.

274
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:39,836
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you.

275
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:43,256
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

276
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,594
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

277
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:50,889
Because I suspect
that under that cynical shell...

278
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:52,891
...you're at heart
a sentimentalist.

279
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:56,561
Laugh if you will.
I'm familiar with your record.

280
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:58,980
Let me point out just two items.

281
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:02,901
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

282
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:07,239
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the loyalist side.

283
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:09,783
And got well paid on both occasions.

284
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,244
The winning side
would've paid much better.

285
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:13,745
Maybe.

286
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,915
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

287
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:18,959
I have my orders.

288
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,545
I see. Gestapo spank.

289
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:24,548
You overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

290
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,135
I don't interfere with them
and they don't interfere with me.

291
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:30,345
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

292
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:32,764
- I am...
- Maj. Strasser is here, sir.

293
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:35,350
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

294
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,321
Carl, see that the major gets
a good table, close to the ladies.

295
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:53,201
I've already given him the best, knowing
he is German and would take it anyway.

296
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:58,540
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

297
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,505
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

298
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,054
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

299
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:15,474
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

300
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,268
It's a pleasure to have you here.

301
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:20,103
Champagne and a tin of caviar.

302
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:23,857
<i>May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26?
A good French wine.</i>

303
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:25,692
Very well, sir.

304
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,488
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight.

305
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,033
You'll see the arrest of the man
who murdered your couriers.

306
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:34,951
I expected no less, captain.

307
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,787
Monsieur Ugarte.

308
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:43,001
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

309
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:45,337
May I first cash my chips?

310
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:55,222
Very lucky.
Two thousand, please.

311
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:57,641
Two thousand.

312
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:03,855
Thank you.

313
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:19,037
Rick, help me!

314
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,583
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- Rick, hide me! You must help me!

315
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:24,918
Do something!

316
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:26,420
Rick!

317
00:22:31,174 --> 00:22:32,300
Excellent, captain.

318
00:22:32,592 --> 00:22:35,011
When they come to get me,
I hope you'll be more help.

319
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:37,472
I stick my neck out for nobody.

320
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:41,476
I'm sorry there was a disturbance,
folks, but it's all over now.

321
00:22:41,768 --> 00:22:45,439
Sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

322
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:56,450
This is Maj. Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

323
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,493
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

324
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:00,829
You know Herr Heinz
of the Third Reich.

325
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,081
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

326
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,628
We are very honored tonight.

327
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:12,758
Maj. Strasser is one reason
the Third Reich enjoys its reputation.

328
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:15,969
You say "Third Reich" as though
you expect there to be others.

329
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:19,139
Personally, major,
I will take what comes.

330
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,142
Do you mind if I ask
a few questions?

331
00:23:22,392 --> 00:23:24,728
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

332
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:27,606
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

333
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:31,276
That makes Rick
a citizen of the world.

334
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:34,112
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you.

335
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:37,741
I understand you came here from Paris
during the occupation.

336
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:39,826
There seems to be no secret about that.

337
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:44,122
Are you one of those who can't imagine
Germans in their beloved Paris?

338
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:46,541
It's not particularly
my beloved Paris.

339
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,543
Can you imagine us in London?

340
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:51,254
When you get there, ask me.

341
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:54,216
- Diplomatist!
- How about New York?

342
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:59,346
There are sections of New York that
I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

343
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:02,682
- Who will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

344
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:05,769
Rick is neutral about everything.
And that takes in...

345
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:07,521
...the field of women too.

346
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:09,856
You weren't always
so carefully neutral.

347
00:24:10,107 --> 00:24:12,776
We have a complete dossier on you.

348
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:18,615
"Richard Blaine, American. Age, 37.
Cannot return to his country."

349
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:21,535
The reason is vague.
We know what you did in Paris...

350
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:25,622
...and why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we won't broadcast it.

351
00:24:25,872 --> 00:24:27,207
Are my eyes really brown?

352
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:29,209
You will forgive my curiosity.

353
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:32,587
The point is, an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

354
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:36,049
...and we are checking up on anyone
who can be of any help.

355
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:40,303
My interest in whether Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

356
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:44,224
In this case, you have
no sympathy for the fox?

357
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:47,853
Not particularly. I understand
the hound's point of view too.

358
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:52,816
Laszlo published the foulest lies in the
Prague newspapers till we marched in.

359
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:57,404
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in a cellar.

360
00:24:57,654 --> 00:25:00,365
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

361
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:03,452
He's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

362
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,706
In Paris, he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

363
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:11,334
Excuse me. Your business is
politics, mine is running a saloon.

364
00:25:11,585 --> 00:25:13,420
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

365
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:17,174
You see, major? You have
nothing to worry about Rick.

366
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:18,300
Perhaps.

367
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:23,263
Yes, monsieur?

368
00:25:23,513 --> 00:25:28,018
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, monsieur. Right this way.

369
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:56,338
<i>Two Cointreaux, please.</i>

370
00:25:58,465 --> 00:26:00,884
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

371
00:26:01,134 --> 00:26:04,179
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

372
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:07,265
If we'd walk out so soon
it'd only call attention to us.

373
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:09,434
Perhaps he's in some
other part of the café.

374
00:26:11,478 --> 00:26:15,273
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

375
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:19,820
You'll find a market for this ring.
I must sell it at a great sacrifice.

376
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,489
- Thank you, but I don't...
- Perhaps for the lady.

377
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:24,074
The ring is quite unique.

378
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:28,453
Yes, I'm very interested.

379
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,913
Good.

380
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:31,540
Your name?

381
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:34,000
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service.

382
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:37,796
I'll meet you at the bar later.

383
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:40,465
We don't want the ring,
but thank you for showing it to us.

384
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:43,802
- Such a bargain. That is your decision?
- It is.

385
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,765
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes.

386
00:26:49,015 --> 00:26:51,017
Captain Renault, prefect of police.

387
00:26:51,268 --> 00:26:52,269
What do you want?

388
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,564
To welcome you to Casablanca
and to wish you a pleasant stay.

389
00:26:55,772 --> 00:26:58,525
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

390
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:01,111
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

391
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:04,865
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

392
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:06,992
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?

393
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:11,538
I was told you were the most
beautiful woman to visit Casablanca.

394
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:13,582
That was a gross understatement.

395
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,083
You're very kind.

396
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,961
- Won't you join us?
- Lf you'll permit me.

397
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:21,923
Emil, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. Put it on my bill.

398
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:27,471
It's a game we play. They put it on the
bill, I tear it up. Very convenient.

399
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:31,183
Captain, the boy
who's playing the piano...

400
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:33,268
Somewhere I've seen him.

401
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,895
- Sam?
- Yes.

402
00:27:35,145 --> 00:27:37,105
He came from Paris with Rick.

403
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:38,398
Rick? Who's he?

404
00:27:38,648 --> 00:27:42,110
- You are in Rick's. Rick is...
- Is what?

405
00:27:42,402 --> 00:27:45,572
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man...
If I were a woman...

406
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:48,492
...and I weren't around,
I'd be in love with Rick.

407
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:52,788
But what a fool I am talking to
a beautiful woman about another man.

408
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,623
Excuse me.

409
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:56,291
Major.

410
00:27:58,168 --> 00:28:01,254
Mademoiselle and monsieur,
may I present Maj. Strasser?

411
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:02,380
How do you do?

412
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,800
This is a pleasure
I've looked forward to.

413
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:07,552
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

414
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:09,846
But you see,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

415
00:28:10,097 --> 00:28:14,643
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now
you're a subject of the German Reich.

416
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:18,688
I've never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

417
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:22,609
I'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

418
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:24,528
This is hardly the time or the place.

419
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:29,157
Then we'll state another time and place.
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

420
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:30,492
With mademoiselle.

421
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:35,205
Capt. Renault,
I am under your authority.

422
00:28:35,455 --> 00:28:37,416
Is it your order
we come to your office?

423
00:28:37,707 --> 00:28:41,545
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

424
00:28:41,795 --> 00:28:43,088
Very well.

425
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:50,345
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

426
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,599
- This time, they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

427
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:57,811
We've been in difficult
places before, haven't we?

428
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:32,929
I must find out what Berger knows.

429
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,391
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

430
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:56,912
Mr. Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

431
00:29:57,537 --> 00:29:59,081
Champagne cocktail, please.

432
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:02,459
I recognize you
from the news photographs.

433
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:06,004
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

434
00:30:06,296 --> 00:30:08,965
I read five times
that you were killed in five places.

435
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:11,927
As you see, it was true
every single time.

436
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:13,512
Thank heaven I found you.

437
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,474
I'm looking for a man named Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.

438
00:30:18,141 --> 00:30:20,227
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

439
00:30:20,477 --> 00:30:22,729
He's under arrest for murder.

440
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:24,815
He was arrested here tonight.

441
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:26,483
I see.

442
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,862
But we, who are still free, will do
all we can. We are organized.

443
00:30:31,154 --> 00:30:33,407
Underground, like everywhere else.

444
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:36,451
Tomorrow night, there is a meeting
at the Café du Roi.

445
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:38,453
If you'll come...

446
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:54,386
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

447
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:56,263
Very well, mademoiselle.

448
00:30:58,765 --> 00:31:02,060
- How's the jewelry business?
- Not so good. Check, please.

449
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:06,523
Too bad you weren't here earlier.
We had quite a bit of excitement, right?

450
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:07,941
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

451
00:31:08,191 --> 00:31:11,278
- My bill.
- No. Two champagnes. Please.

452
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:12,779
Yes, sir.

453
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:18,785
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss Ilsa.

454
00:31:19,035 --> 00:31:21,496
I never expected to see you again.

455
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:23,832
It's been a long time.

456
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,544
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

457
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:31,840
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

458
00:31:41,975 --> 00:31:42,851
Where is Rick?

459
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,937
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

460
00:31:47,064 --> 00:31:48,023
When will he be back?

461
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:50,400
Not tonight no more.
He ain't coming...

462
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,069
He went home.

463
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:55,363
Does he always leave so early?

464
00:31:55,572 --> 00:31:59,201
Oh, he never...
He's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot.

465
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:01,578
Goes up there all the time.

466
00:32:03,246 --> 00:32:05,916
You used to be
a much better liar, Sam.

467
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:10,003
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.
You're bad luck to him.

468
00:32:13,006 --> 00:32:15,717
Play it once, Sam.
For old time's sake.

469
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:18,512
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.

470
00:32:19,096 --> 00:32:20,680
Play it, Sam.

471
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:23,600
Play "As Time Goes By."

472
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,978
I can't remember it.
I'm a little rusty on it.

473
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:29,940
I'll hum it for you.

474
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:42,828
Sing it, Sam.

475
00:32:45,455 --> 00:32:47,916
<i>You must remember this</i>

476
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:50,752
<i>A kiss is just a kiss</i>

477
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:55,424
<i>A sigh is just a sigh</i>

478
00:32:57,551 --> 00:33:01,680
<i>The fundamental things apply</i>

479
00:33:01,888 --> 00:33:05,809
<i>As time goes by</i>

480
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:11,690
<i>And when two lovers woo</i>

481
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:14,693
<i>They still say, "I love you"</i>

482
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:17,154
<i>On that you can rely</i>

483
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:25,120
<i>No matter what the future brings</i>

484
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:28,331
<i>As time goes by</i>

485
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:31,835
Sam, I thought I told you
never to play...

486
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:45,474
You were asking about Rick
and here he is. May I present...

487
00:33:45,766 --> 00:33:48,018
- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.

488
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:51,688
You've already met Rick?
Then perhaps you also...

489
00:33:51,938 --> 00:33:53,273
This is Mr. Laszlo.

490
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:54,775
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

491
00:33:55,275 --> 00:33:57,319
One hears a great deal
about Rick in Casablanca.

492
00:33:57,611 --> 00:33:59,446
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

493
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,615
- Join us for a drink?
- Rick never...

494
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:02,657
Thanks, I will.

495
00:34:02,949 --> 00:34:06,578
Well! A precedent
is being broken. Emil?

496
00:34:07,704 --> 00:34:09,831
A very interesting café.
I congratulate you.

497
00:34:10,123 --> 00:34:11,666
- I congratulate you.
- What for?

498
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:12,834
Your work.

499
00:34:13,293 --> 00:34:14,711
Thank you. I try.

500
00:34:15,712 --> 00:34:17,547
We all try. You succeed.

501
00:34:17,798 --> 00:34:20,175
She was asking about you earlier...

502
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:23,220
...in a way that made me
extremely jealous.

503
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,971
I wasn't sure you were the same.

504
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:28,642
- The last time we met...
- Was La Belle Aurore.

505
00:34:30,227 --> 00:34:32,145
How nice. You remembered.

506
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:35,065
That was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

507
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,442
Not an easy day to forget.

508
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:41,947
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

509
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,992
Yes. I put that dress away.

510
00:34:46,243 --> 00:34:48,495
When the Germans march out,
I'll wear it again.

511
00:34:48,745 --> 00:34:52,916
You're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

512
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,503
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

513
00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:59,297
So it is. We have a curfew
here in Casablanca.

514
00:34:59,506 --> 00:35:02,968
It wouldn't do for the chief of police
to be drinking after hours.

515
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:06,096
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.

516
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,973
- Your check, sir.
- My party.

517
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:11,727
Another precedent gone. This has been
a very interesting evening.

518
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:15,814
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night...

519
00:35:16,273 --> 00:35:17,774
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

520
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:20,026
- Say good night to Sam.
- I will.

521
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:25,115
There's still nobody in the world
who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

522
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:27,993
He hasn't played it in a long time.

523
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:30,328
Good night.

524
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:32,122
Good night.

525
00:35:41,214 --> 00:35:43,717
A very puzzling fellow.
What sort is he?

526
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:47,095
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

527
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:50,015
- Tomorrow at 10 at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

528
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:51,266
Good night.

529
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:31,932
Boss?

530
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,771
- Boss?
- Yeah?

531
00:36:38,271 --> 00:36:41,274
- Ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

532
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:44,486
Ain't you planning on going to bed
in the near future?

533
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,822
- You ever going to bed?
- No!

534
00:36:47,697 --> 00:36:49,408
I ain't sleepy either.

535
00:36:49,616 --> 00:36:50,784
Then have a drink.

536
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:52,828
- Not me.
- Well, don't have a drink.

537
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,496
Let's get out of here.

538
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:57,207
No, sir.
I'm waiting for a lady.

539
00:36:57,457 --> 00:37:00,001
Let's go. Ain't nothing
but trouble for you here.

540
00:37:00,293 --> 00:37:02,087
I know she's coming back.

541
00:37:02,379 --> 00:37:04,089
We'll drive all night.

542
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:06,967
We'll get drunk
and stay away till she's gone.

543
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:09,052
Shut up and go home, will you?

544
00:37:09,302 --> 00:37:12,180
No, sir. I'm staying right here.

545
00:37:17,394 --> 00:37:20,313
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

546
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:23,859
That's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

547
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:27,237
- Sam.
- Yes, boss.

548
00:37:27,487 --> 00:37:31,700
If it's December, 1941, in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

549
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:33,326
What...?

550
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:35,120
My watch stopped.

551
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:38,165
I bet they're asleep in New York.

552
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:41,126
I bet they're asleep all over America.

553
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:51,386
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

554
00:37:52,262 --> 00:37:54,347
...she walks into mine.

555
00:38:01,772 --> 00:38:04,232
- What are you playing?
- A little something of my own.

556
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:07,194
- Stop it. You know what I wanna hear.
- I don't.

557
00:38:07,444 --> 00:38:09,821
You played it for her,
you can play it for me.

558
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:13,200
- I don't remember...
- lf she can stand it, I can.

559
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,743
Play it!

560
00:38:15,452 --> 00:38:16,953
Yes, boss.

561
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,463
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

562
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:51,840
What did you do
and what did you think?

563
00:39:52,382 --> 00:39:54,301
We said no questions.

564
00:39:58,972 --> 00:40:01,099
Here's looking at you, kid.

565
00:40:35,008 --> 00:40:36,676
A franc for your thoughts.

566
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:39,304
In America they'd bring only a penny.

567
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,723
I guess that's about
all they're worth.

568
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:45,310
I'm willing to be overcharged.

569
00:40:45,602 --> 00:40:46,561
Tell me.

570
00:40:47,437 --> 00:40:48,980
Well, I was wondering...

571
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:55,112
...why I'm so lucky, why I should
find you waiting for me to come along?

572
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:58,490
Why there is no other man in my life?

573
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:03,120
That's easy. There was.

574
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:06,665
He's dead.

575
00:41:07,624 --> 00:41:09,501
I'm sorry for asking.

576
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,546
I forgot we said no questions.

577
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:20,220
Only one answer can take care
of all our questions.

578
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:08,060
Nothing can stop them now.
Wednesday they'll be in Paris.

579
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:11,354
They'll find out your record.
It won't be safe here.

580
00:42:11,646 --> 00:42:13,774
I'm on their blacklist already.

581
00:42:13,982 --> 00:42:15,817
Their "roll of honor."

582
00:42:22,324 --> 00:42:24,242
<i>Hearts full of passion</i>

583
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:27,037
<i>Jealousy and hate</i>

584
00:42:27,537 --> 00:42:29,623
<i>Woman needs man</i>

585
00:42:29,873 --> 00:42:32,501
<i>And man must have his mate</i>

586
00:42:32,876 --> 00:42:37,130
<i>That no one can deny</i>

587
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:41,009
<i>It's still the same old story</i>

588
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:43,553
<i>A fight for love and glory</i>

589
00:42:43,804 --> 00:42:47,516
<i>A case of do or die</i>

590
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:54,481
<i>The world will always welcome lovers</i>

591
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,195
<i>As time goes by</i>

592
00:43:00,737 --> 00:43:02,948
Henri wants us
to finish three more bottles.

593
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,285
He'll water his garden with champagne
before he lets the Germans drink it.

594
00:43:07,577 --> 00:43:10,789
This ought to take the sting
out of being occupied.

595
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:12,249
You said it.

596
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:14,626
Here's looking at you, kid.

597
00:43:41,945 --> 00:43:43,697
My German's a little rusty.

598
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:46,616
It's the Gestapo.

599
00:43:48,535 --> 00:43:51,288
They say they expect
to be in Paris tomorrow.

600
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:56,001
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

601
00:43:59,296 --> 00:44:02,215
With the world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

602
00:44:02,466 --> 00:44:04,176
Yeah, it's pretty bad timing.

603
00:44:04,468 --> 00:44:06,261
Where were you 10 years ago?

604
00:44:06,595 --> 00:44:07,971
Ten years ago?

605
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:11,016
Let's see...

606
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:15,145
Yes, I was having a brace
put on my teeth. Where were you?

607
00:44:15,812 --> 00:44:17,606
Looking for a job.

608
00:44:23,987 --> 00:44:25,572
Was that cannon fire?

609
00:44:26,573 --> 00:44:27,949
Or my heart pounding?

610
00:44:28,241 --> 00:44:33,246
It's the German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

611
00:44:34,581 --> 00:44:36,750
And getting closer every minute.

612
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:41,546
Here, here, drink up.
We'll never finish the other three.

613
00:44:41,797 --> 00:44:45,842
Germans will be here pretty soon
and they'll come looking for you.

614
00:44:46,093 --> 00:44:47,427
There's a price on your head.

615
00:44:47,677 --> 00:44:50,722
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

616
00:44:51,264 --> 00:44:52,516
It's strange.

617
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,268
I know so very little about you.

618
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:57,062
I know little about you.

619
00:44:57,354 --> 00:44:59,940
Except that you had
your teeth straightened.

620
00:45:00,941 --> 00:45:03,735
Be serious. You're in danger.
You must leave Paris.

621
00:45:04,027 --> 00:45:05,195
No, we must leave.

622
00:45:06,196 --> 00:45:07,614
Yes, of course. We.

623
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:12,244
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

624
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:14,788
Not at my hotel. I...

625
00:45:15,872 --> 00:45:18,542
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

626
00:45:19,209 --> 00:45:20,752
I'll meet you at the station.

627
00:45:21,044 --> 00:45:23,088
All right, at a quarter to 5.

628
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,132
Why don't we marry
in Marseilles?

629
00:45:29,886 --> 00:45:31,555
That's too far ahead to plan.

630
00:45:31,805 --> 00:45:34,182
I guess it is a little too far ahead.

631
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:38,103
What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

632
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:43,108
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that...

633
00:45:44,901 --> 00:45:45,944
What's wrong, kid?

634
00:45:52,576 --> 00:45:54,578
I love you so much.

635
00:45:56,997 --> 00:45:59,416
And I hate this war so much.

636
00:46:01,418 --> 00:46:04,588
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

637
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,799
If you shouldn't get away...

638
00:46:09,593 --> 00:46:11,887
If something should keep us apart...

639
00:46:12,763 --> 00:46:14,431
...wherever they put you...

640
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:18,101
...and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that l...

641
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:24,983
Kiss me.

642
00:46:25,442 --> 00:46:27,944
Kiss me as if it were
the last time.

643
00:46:53,387 --> 00:46:56,890
All aboard! The last train
leaving in three minutes.

644
00:47:04,398 --> 00:47:05,524
Have you seen her?

645
00:47:05,732 --> 00:47:08,527
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

646
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:11,154
But this note came
just after you left.

647
00:47:25,919 --> 00:47:27,671
That's the last call,
Mr. Richard.

648
00:47:28,338 --> 00:47:29,923
Do you hear me?

649
00:47:30,424 --> 00:47:33,844
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

650
00:48:25,228 --> 00:48:27,230
Rick, I have to talk to you.

651
00:48:28,315 --> 00:48:31,777
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

652
00:48:32,402 --> 00:48:35,781
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

653
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,951
Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.

654
00:48:40,327 --> 00:48:43,038
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known that you were here.

655
00:48:43,246 --> 00:48:44,956
Believe me, it's true.
I didn't know.

656
00:48:45,248 --> 00:48:48,668
It's funny how your voice hasn't
changed. I can still hear it.

657
00:48:48,919 --> 00:48:51,254
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

658
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:55,092
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

659
00:48:55,759 --> 00:48:58,095
I can understand how you feel.

660
00:48:58,595 --> 00:49:00,722
You understand how I feel?

661
00:49:01,515 --> 00:49:03,225
How long was it we had, honey?

662
00:49:04,101 --> 00:49:06,061
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

663
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,146
Every one of them.

664
00:49:08,855 --> 00:49:11,233
Mostly, I remember the last one.

665
00:49:11,691 --> 00:49:15,195
The "wow" finish. A guy standing
on a platform in the rain...

666
00:49:15,445 --> 00:49:19,991
...with a comical look on his face
from his insides having been kicked out.

667
00:49:21,618 --> 00:49:23,703
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

668
00:49:23,954 --> 00:49:25,622
Has it got a "wow" finish?

669
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,583
I don't know the finish yet.

670
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:31,962
Go on, tell it. Maybe one will
come to you as you go along.

671
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:38,552
It's about a girl who'd just come
to Paris from her home in Oslo.

672
00:49:38,802 --> 00:49:40,470
At the house of some friends...

673
00:49:40,721 --> 00:49:43,390
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

674
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,059
A very great and courageous man.

675
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:52,274
He opened up for her a beautiful world
full of knowledge, thoughts and ideals.

676
00:49:52,482 --> 00:49:56,069
Everything she knew or ever became
was because of him.

677
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,240
She looked up to him
and worshiped him...

678
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,909
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

679
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,495
Yes, that's very pretty.

680
00:50:05,746 --> 00:50:08,957
I heard a story once.
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

681
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:12,127
They went along with
the sound of a tinny piano...

682
00:50:12,335 --> 00:50:14,546
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

683
00:50:15,422 --> 00:50:20,052
"Mister, I met a man once when
I was a kid," they'd always begin.

684
00:50:22,763 --> 00:50:26,099
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

685
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,392
Tell me...

686
00:50:28,685 --> 00:50:30,645
...who was it you left me for?

687
00:50:30,854 --> 00:50:33,440
Was it Laszlo, or were there
others in between...

688
00:50:34,441 --> 00:50:36,526
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

689
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:05,305
I suspect Ugarte left
the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

690
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:08,058
I suggest you search
the café immediately.

691
00:51:08,308 --> 00:51:11,228
If Rick has them, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

692
00:51:11,478 --> 00:51:13,313
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

693
00:51:13,563 --> 00:51:16,358
My impression was that he's just
another blundering American.

694
00:51:16,566 --> 00:51:18,693
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

695
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:22,197
I was with them when they
blundered into Berlin in 1918.

696
00:51:22,906 --> 00:51:25,575
As to Laszlo, we want him watched
24 hours a day.

697
00:51:25,826 --> 00:51:29,621
It may interest you to know that
at this moment he's on his way here.

698
00:51:35,335 --> 00:51:37,337
There's nothing we can do.

699
00:51:38,588 --> 00:51:41,133
I'm delighted to see you both.
Did you rest well?

700
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:42,175
I slept well.

701
00:51:42,426 --> 00:51:45,971
That's strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

702
00:51:46,346 --> 00:51:49,725
- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Sit down.

703
00:51:52,352 --> 00:51:55,647
We won't mince words. You're
an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

704
00:51:55,856 --> 00:51:58,525
So far, you've been
fortunate enough in eluding us.

705
00:51:58,775 --> 00:52:00,318
You have reached Casablanca.

706
00:52:00,527 --> 00:52:03,238
It is my duty to see
that you stay here.

707
00:52:03,447 --> 00:52:05,449
Whether or not you'll
succeed is problematic.

708
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:08,410
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

709
00:52:08,618 --> 00:52:11,246
Is it possible Herr Laszlo
will receive a visa?

710
00:52:11,455 --> 00:52:13,749
I'm afraid not.
My regrets, monsieur.

711
00:52:13,957 --> 00:52:16,460
Well, perhaps
I shall like it in Casablanca.

712
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,211
And mademoiselle?

713
00:52:18,462 --> 00:52:22,048
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

714
00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:25,135
Don't be in a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

715
00:52:25,385 --> 00:52:27,888
You may be in
Casablanca indefinitely.

716
00:52:28,388 --> 00:52:31,391
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.
On one condition.

717
00:52:31,641 --> 00:52:32,434
And that is?

718
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:36,063
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

719
00:52:36,313 --> 00:52:39,941
...in Brussels, in Amsterdam,
in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens...

720
00:52:40,233 --> 00:52:42,694
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

721
00:52:42,986 --> 00:52:47,407
If you'll furnish me with their names
and whereabouts, you'll have your visa.

722
00:52:47,741 --> 00:52:50,869
And the honor of having
served the Third Reich.

723
00:52:51,161 --> 00:52:53,580
I was in a German
concentration camp for a year.

724
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,290
That's honor enough for a lifetime.

725
00:52:55,832 --> 00:52:57,209
You'll give us the names?

726
00:52:58,835 --> 00:53:01,296
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

727
00:53:01,588 --> 00:53:04,508
...where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal...

728
00:53:04,758 --> 00:53:07,302
...I certainly won't
give them to you now.

729
00:53:07,844 --> 00:53:10,097
What if you track them down
and kill them?

730
00:53:10,347 --> 00:53:11,890
What if you murdered us all?

731
00:53:12,182 --> 00:53:16,311
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

732
00:53:16,603 --> 00:53:18,814
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

733
00:53:19,272 --> 00:53:22,567
You have a reputation for eloquence,
which I can now understand.

734
00:53:22,776 --> 00:53:24,236
But you're mistaken.

735
00:53:24,528 --> 00:53:27,072
You said enemies of the Reich
could be replaced.

736
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,782
There is one exception.

737
00:53:29,032 --> 00:53:31,410
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

738
00:53:31,701 --> 00:53:34,579
...should occur to you
while you're trying to escape.

739
00:53:35,122 --> 00:53:37,165
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

740
00:53:37,457 --> 00:53:39,084
This is still unoccupied France.

741
00:53:39,543 --> 00:53:42,129
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on the captain.

742
00:53:42,379 --> 00:53:45,090
- Insofar as it is in my power...
- Thank you.

743
00:53:45,382 --> 00:53:49,636
By the way, last night you evinced
an interest in Señor Ugarte.

744
00:53:50,137 --> 00:53:51,096
Yes.

745
00:53:51,388 --> 00:53:52,889
You have a message for him.

746
00:53:54,224 --> 00:53:56,476
Nothing important.
May I speak to him now?

747
00:53:57,227 --> 00:53:59,980
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

748
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,023
Señor Ugarte is dead.

749
00:54:08,822 --> 00:54:10,073
I'm making the report.

750
00:54:10,323 --> 00:54:13,452
We haven't quite decided whether
he committed suicide...

751
00:54:13,744 --> 00:54:15,412
...or died trying to escape.

752
00:54:17,247 --> 00:54:19,916
- Are you finished with us?
- For the time being.

753
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:21,334
Good day.

754
00:54:26,006 --> 00:54:28,550
Their next step
will be to the black market.

755
00:54:28,842 --> 00:54:29,885
Excuse me, captain.

756
00:54:30,093 --> 00:54:32,596
Another visa
problem has come up.

757
00:54:33,513 --> 00:54:35,098
Show her in.

758
00:54:45,192 --> 00:54:48,028
Sorry, we wouldn't be able
to handle the police.

759
00:54:48,278 --> 00:54:50,781
- This is a job for Señor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

760
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:53,366
It can be most helpful
to know Ferrari.

761
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:56,203
He has a monopoly
on the black market here.

762
00:54:56,453 --> 00:54:58,371
You'll find him at the Blue Parrot.

763
00:54:58,622 --> 00:55:00,540
Thanks.

764
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:14,179
Don't be too downhearted.

765
00:55:14,471 --> 00:55:17,224
Perhaps you can come to terms
with Capt. Renault.

766
00:55:17,974 --> 00:55:20,185
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

767
00:55:20,477 --> 00:55:22,854
I see the bus is in.
I'll take my shipment.

768
00:55:23,063 --> 00:55:25,774
- No hurry. Have a drink.
- I never drink in the morning.

769
00:55:25,982 --> 00:55:29,361
Every time you send my shipment,
it's always a bit short.

770
00:55:29,569 --> 00:55:31,613
Carrying charges, my boy.

771
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:33,156
Here, sit down.

772
00:55:33,407 --> 00:55:35,909
There's something
I want to talk over with you.

773
00:55:38,161 --> 00:55:39,788
The news about Ugarte upsets me.

774
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,125
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier than I do.

775
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:44,167
Of course not.

776
00:55:44,418 --> 00:55:48,463
What upsets me is that he's dead and
no one knows where those letters are.

777
00:55:48,755 --> 00:55:49,798
Practically no one.

778
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:52,509
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

779
00:55:52,759 --> 00:55:54,803
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

780
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:57,055
I've a proposition
for whoever has them.

781
00:55:57,264 --> 00:55:58,724
I'll handle the transaction.

782
00:55:59,015 --> 00:56:01,852
Get rid of the letters, take
all the risk, for a small fee.

783
00:56:02,102 --> 00:56:03,562
And the carrying charges?

784
00:56:03,854 --> 00:56:06,648
Naturally, there will be
a few incidental expenses.

785
00:56:07,274 --> 00:56:09,568
That's my proposition
for whoever has the letters.

786
00:56:09,776 --> 00:56:11,278
I'll tell him when he comes in.

787
00:56:11,528 --> 00:56:14,281
I'll put my cards out.
I think you know where they are.

788
00:56:14,531 --> 00:56:18,243
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

789
00:56:23,457 --> 00:56:26,460
I came over here to give them
a chance to ransack my place.

790
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,963
Don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

791
00:56:30,213 --> 00:56:32,424
Excuse me,
I'll be getting back.

792
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:39,598
- Good morning.
- Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

793
00:56:43,977 --> 00:56:46,730
You won't find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

794
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,231
Only 700 francs.

795
00:56:48,482 --> 00:56:50,233
You're being cheated.

796
00:56:50,484 --> 00:56:51,735
It doesn't matter, thank you.

797
00:56:51,985 --> 00:56:54,905
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

798
00:56:55,155 --> 00:56:57,824
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

799
00:56:58,075 --> 00:57:01,203
I'm sorry I was in no condition
to receive you last night.

800
00:57:01,411 --> 00:57:02,329
It doesn't matter.

801
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:05,165
Special friends of Rick's
get a special discount.

802
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:06,500
One hundred francs.

803
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,878
Your story had me confused,
or maybe it was the bourbon.

804
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,421
I have some tablecloths...

805
00:57:11,671 --> 00:57:14,424
- I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

806
00:57:14,925 --> 00:57:18,553
Did you come back to tell me
why you ran out on me at the station?

807
00:57:18,762 --> 00:57:19,596
Yes.

808
00:57:19,846 --> 00:57:22,224
You can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

809
00:57:22,432 --> 00:57:23,809
I don't think I will.

810
00:57:24,017 --> 00:57:28,188
Why not? I got stuck with the
railway ticket. I'm entitled to know.

811
00:57:28,605 --> 00:57:30,857
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

812
00:57:31,441 --> 00:57:34,694
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him. He'd understand.

813
00:57:34,945 --> 00:57:37,531
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

814
00:57:39,116 --> 00:57:41,910
I'll be leaving soon and
we'll never see each other again.

815
00:57:43,203 --> 00:57:46,748
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

816
00:57:47,374 --> 00:57:51,753
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll
remember those days, and not Casablanca.

817
00:57:52,712 --> 00:57:53,964
Not last night.

818
00:57:54,464 --> 00:57:57,634
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it'd be like?

819
00:57:57,884 --> 00:58:00,762
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

820
00:58:01,054 --> 00:58:02,639
Believe that if you want to.

821
00:58:02,889 --> 00:58:05,559
I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

822
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:07,644
Above a saloon, it's true, but...

823
00:58:07,894 --> 00:58:10,939
Walk up a flight.
I'll be expecting you.

824
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:15,944
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

825
00:58:16,153 --> 00:58:17,612
You'll be there.

826
00:58:19,489 --> 00:58:20,949
No, Rick.

827
00:58:21,908 --> 00:58:24,703
No. You see,
Victor Laszlo is my husband.

828
00:58:25,245 --> 00:58:28,457
And was, even when
I knew you in Paris.

829
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,632
I was just telling Laszlo that,
unfortunately, I'm not able to help him.

830
00:58:38,175 --> 00:58:39,926
The word has gone around.

831
00:58:40,177 --> 00:58:44,514
As leader of all illegal activities,
I'm an influential and respected man.

832
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:48,310
But it'd not be worth my life
to do anything for Laszlo.

833
00:58:48,602 --> 00:58:50,395
You, however, are a different matter.

834
00:58:50,687 --> 00:58:55,150
Señor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

835
00:58:55,692 --> 00:58:58,695
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

836
00:58:58,945 --> 00:59:01,990
I'll stay and keep trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

837
00:59:02,199 --> 00:59:03,909
Might as well be frank.

838
00:59:04,117 --> 00:59:07,746
It'd take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

839
00:59:08,121 --> 00:59:10,040
We're only interested in two visas.

840
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,626
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

841
00:59:13,126 --> 00:59:15,045
You two will want to discuss this.

842
00:59:15,295 --> 00:59:17,672
Excuse me.
I'll be at the bar.

843
00:59:21,134 --> 00:59:22,886
No, I won't let you stay here.

844
00:59:23,136 --> 00:59:26,390
You must get to America.
Somehow I'll get out and join you.

845
00:59:26,723 --> 00:59:28,475
If the situation were different...

846
00:59:28,725 --> 00:59:31,228
...if I had to stay and there was
only one visa...

847
00:59:31,478 --> 00:59:32,604
...would you take it?

848
00:59:33,897 --> 00:59:34,898
Yes, I would.

849
00:59:36,149 --> 00:59:37,901
Yes, I see.

850
00:59:38,652 --> 00:59:40,570
When I had trouble
getting out of Lille...

851
00:59:40,821 --> 00:59:42,280
...why didn't you leave me?

852
00:59:42,572 --> 00:59:46,827
When I was sick in Marseilles
for two weeks and you were in danger...

853
00:59:47,077 --> 00:59:48,620
...why didn't you leave me?

854
00:59:49,996 --> 00:59:52,416
I meant to.
Something always held me up.

855
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:56,378
I love you very much.

856
00:59:57,587 --> 01:00:00,006
Your secret will be safe with me.

857
01:00:00,924 --> 01:00:02,843
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

858
01:00:03,176 --> 01:00:05,220
Not more than 50 francs.

859
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,810
We've decided, Señor Ferrari.

860
01:00:12,102 --> 01:00:15,647
For the present we're looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

861
01:00:15,856 --> 01:00:17,566
Good luck, but be careful.

862
01:00:17,858 --> 01:00:20,569
- You know you're being shadowed?
- It becomes instinct.

863
01:00:21,111 --> 01:00:23,947
I observe that you, in one respect,
are very fortunate.

864
01:00:24,281 --> 01:00:26,825
I'll make one suggestion.
Why, I do not know.

865
01:00:27,117 --> 01:00:29,077
It cannot possibly profit me.

866
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:31,580
Have you heard
about the letters of transit?

867
01:00:32,539 --> 01:00:33,415
Yes, something.

868
01:00:33,707 --> 01:00:36,501
They were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

869
01:00:37,043 --> 01:00:39,004
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

870
01:00:39,296 --> 01:00:42,299
But my guess is Ugarte left
those letters with Rick.

871
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:47,304
He's a difficult man.
One never knows what he'll do, or why.

872
01:00:47,637 --> 01:00:49,264
But it is worth a chance.

873
01:00:49,806 --> 01:00:52,350
Thank you very much.
Good day.

874
01:00:52,893 --> 01:00:54,603
Bye. Thank you for your coffee.

875
01:00:54,811 --> 01:00:56,563
I shall miss that when we leave.

876
01:00:56,813 --> 01:00:59,483
It was gracious of you
to share it with me.

877
01:00:59,733 --> 01:01:01,943
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

878
01:01:11,411 --> 01:01:13,413
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

879
01:01:13,747 --> 01:01:15,499
- I'd better be going.
- Check, please.

880
01:01:15,749 --> 01:01:19,461
I have to warn you. This is
a dangerous place, full of vultures.

881
01:01:19,753 --> 01:01:22,422
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks.
- Goodbye.

882
01:01:22,672 --> 01:01:25,717
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
I'm sorry.

883
01:01:43,026 --> 01:01:46,154
You are getting to be
your best customer.

884
01:01:47,697 --> 01:01:50,117
Well, drinking!
I'm very pleased with you.

885
01:01:50,367 --> 01:01:52,119
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

886
01:01:52,369 --> 01:01:54,538
That's some going-over
your men gave my place.

887
01:01:54,788 --> 01:01:56,832
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

888
01:01:57,124 --> 01:01:59,042
I told Strasser
he wouldn't find the letters.

889
01:01:59,292 --> 01:02:01,378
But I told my men to be
especially destructive.

890
01:02:01,628 --> 01:02:04,506
You know how that impresses Germans.

891
01:02:05,132 --> 01:02:07,467
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

892
01:02:07,718 --> 01:02:10,178
Louis, are you pro-Vichy
or Free French?

893
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:14,516
Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.

894
01:02:14,808 --> 01:02:16,810
It looks like you're a little late.

895
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:26,570
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

896
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:30,782
Who knows? In her own way, she may
constitute an entire second front.

897
01:02:31,241 --> 01:02:34,536
It's time for me to flatter Strasser.
I'll see you later.

898
01:02:35,245 --> 01:02:36,663
Sascha!

899
01:02:36,913 --> 01:02:37,789
French '75.

900
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:39,583
Put up the whole row of those.

901
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:41,877
Starting here and ending here.

902
01:02:42,169 --> 01:02:44,379
We will begin with two.

903
01:02:52,596 --> 01:02:54,639
What did you say?
Would you repeat it?

904
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:56,475
What I said is
not your business.

905
01:02:56,683 --> 01:02:58,143
I'll make it my business.

906
01:03:04,441 --> 01:03:08,111
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Lay off politics or get out.

907
01:03:12,532 --> 01:03:14,034
You see, captain?

908
01:03:14,284 --> 01:03:16,286
The situation is not under control.

909
01:03:16,536 --> 01:03:18,747
We're trying to cooperate
with your government.

910
01:03:18,955 --> 01:03:20,916
We can't regulate
our people's feelings.

911
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,585
Are you certain which side you're on?

912
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,921
I have no conviction.

913
01:03:26,129 --> 01:03:27,381
I blow with the wind...

914
01:03:27,631 --> 01:03:29,883
...and the prevailing wind
is from Vichy.

915
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:31,927
And if it should change?

916
01:03:32,302 --> 01:03:34,304
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

917
01:03:34,554 --> 01:03:36,515
We're concerned about more
than Casablanca.

918
01:03:36,723 --> 01:03:40,477
Every French province in Africa
is honeycombed with traitors...

919
01:03:40,727 --> 01:03:43,480
...waiting for their chance,
waiting perhaps for a leader.

920
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:45,816
A leader? Like Laszlo?

921
01:03:46,066 --> 01:03:47,442
I have been thinking.

922
01:03:47,651 --> 01:03:50,737
It is too dangerous if you
let him go or let him stay.

923
01:03:50,987 --> 01:03:51,988
I see what you mean.

924
01:03:57,994 --> 01:03:59,454
Thank you, Carl.

925
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,748
Thank you, Carl.

926
01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:04,292
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

927
01:04:04,584 --> 01:04:07,003
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

928
01:04:07,254 --> 01:04:08,380
Thank you very much.

929
01:04:08,588 --> 01:04:11,383
I thought you'd ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

930
01:04:11,675 --> 01:04:13,135
...and the dress glass.

931
01:04:13,427 --> 01:04:15,137
At last the day's came!

932
01:04:15,429 --> 01:04:18,473
We are speaking nothing
but English now.

933
01:04:18,765 --> 01:04:21,476
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

934
01:04:21,685 --> 01:04:23,478
A very nice idea.

935
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:25,230
To America.

936
01:04:25,856 --> 01:04:26,690
To America.

937
01:04:34,281 --> 01:04:35,949
What watch?

938
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,494
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

939
01:04:41,204 --> 01:04:43,498
You'll get along
beautifully in America.

940
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:46,209
How is lady luck treating you?

941
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:48,045
Oh, too bad.

942
01:04:48,712 --> 01:04:50,547
You'll find him over there.

943
01:04:56,887 --> 01:04:58,305
Monsieur Rick?

944
01:04:58,555 --> 01:05:01,433
- Could I speak to you?
- How'd you get in? You're underage.

945
01:05:01,641 --> 01:05:04,269
- I came with Capt. Renault.
- I should've known.

946
01:05:04,478 --> 01:05:05,771
My husband is with me too.

947
01:05:05,979 --> 01:05:08,648
He is? Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

948
01:05:08,899 --> 01:05:09,733
Have a drink?

949
01:05:09,983 --> 01:05:12,235
Of course not.
You mind if I do?

950
01:05:13,403 --> 01:05:16,656
Monsieur Rick, what kind of a man
is Capt. Renault?

951
01:05:16,907 --> 01:05:18,533
Like any other man,
only more so.

952
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:21,953
No, I mean...
Is he trustworthy? Is his word...

953
01:05:22,162 --> 01:05:24,122
Who told you to ask me that?

954
01:05:24,414 --> 01:05:25,999
He did. Capt. Renault.

955
01:05:26,249 --> 01:05:28,418
I thought so.
Where's your husband?

956
01:05:29,002 --> 01:05:32,923
At the roulette table, trying
to win enough for our exit visas.

957
01:05:33,173 --> 01:05:34,883
Of course he's losing.

958
01:05:35,092 --> 01:05:36,802
How long have you been married?

959
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:38,053
Eight weeks.

960
01:05:39,012 --> 01:05:41,014
We come from Bulgaria.

961
01:05:41,431 --> 01:05:43,433
Things are very bad there.

962
01:05:43,683 --> 01:05:46,061
The devil has the people
by the throat.

963
01:05:46,353 --> 01:05:48,897
So Jan and I, we...

964
01:05:49,106 --> 01:05:51,691
We don't want our children
to grow up there.

965
01:05:51,942 --> 01:05:54,194
So you decided to go to America.

966
01:05:54,444 --> 01:05:56,655
But we have not much money...

967
01:05:57,114 --> 01:05:59,574
...and traveling is
so expensive and difficult.

968
01:05:59,866 --> 01:06:02,077
It was more than
we thought to get here.

969
01:06:02,536 --> 01:06:04,413
Then Capt. Renault sees us.

970
01:06:04,621 --> 01:06:06,498
He's so kind.
He wants to help us.

971
01:06:06,706 --> 01:06:07,666
Yes, I'll bet.

972
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:10,419
He tells me he can give us
an exit visa.

973
01:06:10,627 --> 01:06:12,838
But we have no money.

974
01:06:13,046 --> 01:06:14,631
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

975
01:06:14,881 --> 01:06:16,842
And he's still willing
to give you a visa?

976
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,385
You want to know...

977
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:20,262
Will he keep his word?

978
01:06:21,555 --> 01:06:22,472
He always has.

979
01:06:27,811 --> 01:06:29,396
You are a man.

980
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,482
If someone loved you very much...

981
01:06:32,733 --> 01:06:36,695
...so that your happiness was the only
thing she wanted in the world...

982
01:06:37,654 --> 01:06:40,449
...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

983
01:06:41,074 --> 01:06:42,325
...could you forgive her?

984
01:06:42,576 --> 01:06:43,952
Nobody ever loved me that much.

985
01:06:44,161 --> 01:06:48,331
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

986
01:06:48,582 --> 01:06:49,958
...that would be all right?

987
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:52,586
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

988
01:06:52,836 --> 01:06:53,962
Go back to Bulgaria.

989
01:06:54,421 --> 01:06:58,508
But if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America.

990
01:06:59,843 --> 01:07:01,928
But if Jan should find out...

991
01:07:02,179 --> 01:07:03,805
He is such a boy.

992
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:07,267
In many ways,
I am so much older than he is.

993
01:07:07,517 --> 01:07:09,895
Yes, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

994
01:07:10,187 --> 01:07:12,564
Yours may work out.
You'll excuse me.

995
01:07:22,032 --> 01:07:23,116
Good evening.

996
01:07:23,366 --> 01:07:24,284
See? Here we are again.

997
01:07:24,534 --> 01:07:26,870
I'll take that as a compliment to Sam.

998
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:30,290
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

999
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:33,960
He does. Could we have
a table close to him?

1000
01:07:34,211 --> 01:07:36,713
And as far away
from Strasser as possible.

1001
01:07:36,963 --> 01:07:39,508
The geography may be
difficult to arrange.

1002
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,385
Paul, table 30.

1003
01:07:41,635 --> 01:07:43,387
Right this way, if you please.

1004
01:07:43,637 --> 01:07:47,307
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite.

1005
01:07:47,557 --> 01:07:48,934
Thank you.

1006
01:07:58,402 --> 01:07:59,903
Two cognac, please.

1007
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:26,430
Do you wish to place
another bet, sir?

1008
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,724
No, I guess not.

1009
01:08:28,932 --> 01:08:30,892
Have you tried 22 tonight?

1010
01:08:32,519 --> 01:08:33,854
I said "22."

1011
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:51,830
Leave it there.

1012
01:09:06,553 --> 01:09:08,930
Cash it in and don't come back.

1013
01:09:11,141 --> 01:09:13,518
Are you sure this place is honest?

1014
01:09:13,727 --> 01:09:17,272
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

1015
01:09:20,484 --> 01:09:21,777
How are we doing tonight?

1016
01:09:21,985 --> 01:09:24,988
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

1017
01:09:35,582 --> 01:09:37,709
He's just a lucky guy.

1018
01:09:39,836 --> 01:09:42,714
Monsieur Rick, may I get you
a cup of coffee?

1019
01:09:42,923 --> 01:09:44,383
No thanks, Carl.

1020
01:09:48,512 --> 01:09:51,640
- Capt. Renault, may l...
- Not here, please.

1021
01:09:52,015 --> 01:09:53,975
Come to my office.
We'll be businesslike.

1022
01:09:54,267 --> 01:09:57,104
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.

1023
01:09:57,354 --> 01:09:58,980
I'm very happy for both of you.

1024
01:09:59,189 --> 01:10:01,441
Still, it's very strange
that you won.

1025
01:10:01,691 --> 01:10:03,735
Well, maybe not so strange.

1026
01:10:03,944 --> 01:10:06,738
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you so much.

1027
01:10:14,538 --> 01:10:17,124
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

1028
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:20,168
Go away, you crazy Russian.

1029
01:10:30,637 --> 01:10:31,888
As I suspected.

1030
01:10:32,139 --> 01:10:34,266
- You're a rank sentimentalist.
- Why?

1031
01:10:34,474 --> 01:10:36,518
Why interfere
with my little romances?

1032
01:10:36,727 --> 01:10:38,603
Put it down as a gesture to love.

1033
01:10:38,812 --> 01:10:40,313
I forgive you this time.

1034
01:10:40,564 --> 01:10:43,400
But I'll be in tomorrow
with a breathtaking blonde.

1035
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:46,319
And it'll make me
very happy if she loses.

1036
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:51,908
I wonder if I could talk to you?

1037
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,993
Go ahead.

1038
01:10:53,243 --> 01:10:54,870
Isn't there some other place?

1039
01:10:55,162 --> 01:10:57,622
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

1040
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,376
- In my office.
- Right.

1041
01:11:02,836 --> 01:11:05,547
You know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

1042
01:11:05,839 --> 01:11:08,633
I'm privileged to be one
of the leaders of a great movement.

1043
01:11:08,842 --> 01:11:10,552
You know what I've been doing.

1044
01:11:10,844 --> 01:11:14,848
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

1045
01:11:15,098 --> 01:11:17,017
...that I continue my work.

1046
01:11:17,267 --> 01:11:18,602
I'm not interested in politics.

1047
01:11:18,852 --> 01:11:22,647
The problems of the world are not
in my department. I'm a saloonkeeper.

1048
01:11:23,106 --> 01:11:26,526
My friends in the underground tell me
that you've quite a record.

1049
01:11:26,777 --> 01:11:28,236
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

1050
01:11:28,445 --> 01:11:31,281
- You fought the fascists in Spain.
- What of it?

1051
01:11:31,531 --> 01:11:34,659
Isn't it strange you always
seem to fight with the underdog?

1052
01:11:34,993 --> 01:11:36,787
I found that an expensive hobby.

1053
01:11:37,037 --> 01:11:39,664
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

1054
01:11:39,873 --> 01:11:42,793
Are you enough of a businessman
to appreciate 100,000 francs?

1055
01:11:43,043 --> 01:11:44,419
I appreciate it,
but I don't accept it.

1056
01:11:44,711 --> 01:11:45,837
I'll raise it to 200,000.

1057
01:11:46,213 --> 01:11:50,675
Make it a million francs or three.
My answer would still be the same.

1058
01:11:50,884 --> 01:11:53,053
There's a reason
you won't let me have them.

1059
01:11:53,303 --> 01:11:54,429
There is.

1060
01:11:54,888 --> 01:11:57,015
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1061
01:11:57,307 --> 01:11:59,976
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1062
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,646
- My wife?
- Yes.

1063
01:12:43,228 --> 01:12:45,147
Play "La Marseillaise."
Play it!

1064
01:14:01,348 --> 01:14:05,185
See? If Laszlo's presence in a café
can inspire this demonstration...

1065
01:14:05,435 --> 01:14:07,771
...what more will his
presence here bring on?

1066
01:14:08,021 --> 01:14:10,148
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1067
01:14:10,357 --> 01:14:13,110
- Everybody's having a good time.
- Much too good a time.

1068
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,528
The place is to be closed.

1069
01:14:14,778 --> 01:14:17,572
- But I've no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1070
01:14:22,786 --> 01:14:24,413
Everyone is to leave immediately.

1071
01:14:24,621 --> 01:14:26,832
This café is closed
until further notice.

1072
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,042
Clear the room at once!

1073
01:14:32,129 --> 01:14:33,255
On what grounds?

1074
01:14:33,547 --> 01:14:36,925
I'm shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1075
01:14:37,426 --> 01:14:39,094
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1076
01:14:39,386 --> 01:14:40,595
Everybody out at once!

1077
01:14:45,142 --> 01:14:49,104
After this disturbance, it's not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1078
01:14:49,396 --> 01:14:51,898
This morning it wasn't safe
for him to leave.

1079
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:55,152
That's also true,
except to return to occupied France.

1080
01:14:55,402 --> 01:14:58,196
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1081
01:14:58,405 --> 01:14:59,448
Of what value is that?

1082
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:02,534
Remember what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1083
01:15:02,826 --> 01:15:05,996
- There are only two other alternatives.
- What are they?

1084
01:15:06,246 --> 01:15:10,459
French authorities may find a reason to
put him in the concentration camp here.

1085
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:11,710
The other alternative?

1086
01:15:12,002 --> 01:15:16,673
Perhaps you have already observed
that, in Casablanca, human life is cheap.

1087
01:15:17,007 --> 01:15:18,675
Good night, mademoiselle.

1088
01:15:29,019 --> 01:15:32,022
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1089
01:15:55,462 --> 01:15:57,881
Our faithful friend is still there.

1090
01:15:58,131 --> 01:16:00,634
Please don't go
to the underground meeting.

1091
01:16:00,884 --> 01:16:01,760
I must.

1092
01:16:01,968 --> 01:16:05,222
It isn't often that a man gets to
display heroics before his wife.

1093
01:16:05,472 --> 01:16:08,934
Don't joke. After Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1094
01:16:09,226 --> 01:16:10,852
I'm frightened too.

1095
01:16:11,144 --> 01:16:13,563
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1096
01:16:13,855 --> 01:16:15,482
Or carry on the best I can?

1097
01:16:16,066 --> 01:16:18,527
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1098
01:16:19,486 --> 01:16:22,322
Why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?

1099
01:16:22,572 --> 01:16:24,741
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1100
01:16:24,991 --> 01:16:26,410
But he won't sell them.

1101
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:29,121
I'd think if sentiment won't
persuade him, money would.

1102
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,124
Did he give you any reason?

1103
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:34,418
He suggested I ask you.

1104
01:16:34,668 --> 01:16:35,669
Ask me?

1105
01:16:35,919 --> 01:16:38,463
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife."

1106
01:16:38,964 --> 01:16:41,049
I don't know why he said that.

1107
01:16:53,103 --> 01:16:56,273
Our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1108
01:16:57,441 --> 01:16:59,609
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1109
01:17:01,361 --> 01:17:03,780
- Ilsa, l...
- Yes?

1110
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:07,659
When I was in the concentration camp...

1111
01:17:07,951 --> 01:17:10,036
...were you Ionely in Paris?

1112
01:17:11,955 --> 01:17:14,207
Yes, Victor. I was.

1113
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:17,335
I know how it is to be Ionely.

1114
01:17:19,046 --> 01:17:21,298
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1115
01:17:23,383 --> 01:17:25,677
No, Victor. There isn't.

1116
01:17:30,015 --> 01:17:31,266
I love you very much.

1117
01:17:33,977 --> 01:17:35,228
Yes.

1118
01:17:35,896 --> 01:17:37,564
Yes, I know.

1119
01:17:38,648 --> 01:17:41,151
Whatever I do,
will you believe that l...

1120
01:17:41,443 --> 01:17:43,820
You don't even have to say it.

1121
01:17:44,112 --> 01:17:45,697
I'll believe.

1122
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:49,451
Good night, dear.

1123
01:17:51,328 --> 01:17:52,662
Good night.

1124
01:18:01,088 --> 01:18:02,381
Yes, dear?

1125
01:18:07,677 --> 01:18:09,137
Be careful.

1126
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:12,391
Of course I'll be careful.

1127
01:18:55,642 --> 01:18:58,645
Well, you are in pretty good shape,
Herr Rick.

1128
01:18:58,895 --> 01:19:00,981
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1129
01:19:01,231 --> 01:19:02,649
Two weeks, maybe three.

1130
01:19:02,899 --> 01:19:04,985
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe worked before.

1131
01:19:05,235 --> 01:19:07,696
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1132
01:19:07,988 --> 01:19:09,030
Thank you.

1133
01:19:09,322 --> 01:19:11,032
Sascha will be happy to hear it.

1134
01:19:11,324 --> 01:19:12,909
I owe him money.

1135
01:19:13,201 --> 01:19:15,996
- You finish locking up, will you?
- I will.

1136
01:19:16,246 --> 01:19:19,291
- Then I'm going to the meeting...
- Don't tell me.

1137
01:19:19,499 --> 01:19:20,751
I won't.

1138
01:19:21,918 --> 01:19:23,045
Good night.

1139
01:19:24,212 --> 01:19:25,714
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1140
01:19:42,439 --> 01:19:45,609
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1141
01:19:45,859 --> 01:19:49,196
I told you you'd come around,
but this is ahead of schedule.

1142
01:19:49,446 --> 01:19:50,655
Won't you sit down?

1143
01:19:50,864 --> 01:19:54,409
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1144
01:19:54,618 --> 01:19:58,246
Your visit isn't connected by any chance
with the letters of transit?

1145
01:19:58,455 --> 01:20:00,999
As long as I have them,
I'll never be Ionely.

1146
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:03,794
Ask any price,
but give me those letters.

1147
01:20:04,044 --> 01:20:06,588
I went through that with
your husband. It's no deal.

1148
01:20:07,422 --> 01:20:08,799
I know how you feel about me...

1149
01:20:09,049 --> 01:20:11,718
...but please put that aside
for something important.

1150
01:20:11,968 --> 01:20:14,179
Do I have to hear again
how great your husband is...

1151
01:20:14,471 --> 01:20:16,473
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1152
01:20:16,723 --> 01:20:18,183
It was your cause too.

1153
01:20:18,433 --> 01:20:20,852
In your way you were fighting
for the same thing.

1154
01:20:21,144 --> 01:20:24,022
I'm not fighting for anything anymore,
except myself.

1155
01:20:24,231 --> 01:20:26,316
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1156
01:20:32,739 --> 01:20:36,326
We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all...

1157
01:20:36,618 --> 01:20:39,204
I wouldn't bring up Paris.
It's poor salesmanship.

1158
01:20:39,413 --> 01:20:42,958
Listen. If you knew what really
happened, if you knew the truth...

1159
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:45,085
I wouldn't believe you no matter what.

1160
01:20:45,335 --> 01:20:47,754
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1161
01:20:52,592 --> 01:20:54,511
You want to feel sorry for yourself?

1162
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,849
With so much at stake, all you can
think of is your own feeling.

1163
01:20:59,099 --> 01:21:02,394
One woman has hurt you, and you
take revenge on the rest of the world.

1164
01:21:02,686 --> 01:21:05,689
You're a coward and a weakling!

1165
01:21:09,192 --> 01:21:10,318
No.

1166
01:21:10,569 --> 01:21:12,154
Richard, I'm sorry.

1167
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,949
I'm sorry, but you...
You are our last hope.

1168
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:18,994
If you don't help us,
Victor will die in Casablanca.

1169
01:21:19,369 --> 01:21:20,203
What of it?

1170
01:21:20,454 --> 01:21:23,165
I'm gonna die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1171
01:21:30,047 --> 01:21:31,339
Now, if you'Il...

1172
01:21:34,217 --> 01:21:35,510
All right.

1173
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:37,679
I tried to reason with you.

1174
01:21:37,888 --> 01:21:39,973
I tried everything.
I want those letters.

1175
01:21:40,474 --> 01:21:41,433
Get them for me.

1176
01:21:41,641 --> 01:21:43,518
I don't have to.
I got them right here.

1177
01:21:45,437 --> 01:21:47,105
Put them on the table.

1178
01:21:49,107 --> 01:21:49,900
No.

1179
01:21:50,901 --> 01:21:53,070
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1180
01:21:54,571 --> 01:21:58,366
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1181
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:02,412
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1182
01:22:04,331 --> 01:22:07,250
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1183
01:22:14,925 --> 01:22:17,010
I tried to stay away.

1184
01:22:17,677 --> 01:22:20,138
I thought I would never see you again.

1185
01:22:21,598 --> 01:22:23,683
That you were out of my life.

1186
01:22:44,204 --> 01:22:46,623
The day you left Paris...

1187
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:50,168
...if you knew what I went through.

1188
01:22:51,461 --> 01:22:54,256
If you knew how much I loved you.

1189
01:22:55,298 --> 01:22:57,676
How much I still love you.

1190
01:23:12,023 --> 01:23:12,816
And then?

1191
01:23:14,985 --> 01:23:19,281
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1192
01:23:19,573 --> 01:23:23,034
They needed him in Prague.
But the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1193
01:23:23,243 --> 01:23:24,578
Just two lines in the paper:

1194
01:23:24,828 --> 01:23:27,622
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1195
01:23:29,082 --> 01:23:31,418
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1196
01:23:31,668 --> 01:23:32,919
Then it came.

1197
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:35,630
He was dead.
Shot, trying to escape.

1198
01:23:36,548 --> 01:23:39,593
I was Ionely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1199
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:41,636
Then I met you.

1200
01:23:42,262 --> 01:23:45,223
Why weren't you honest?
Why keep your marriage a secret?

1201
01:23:45,432 --> 01:23:48,769
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1202
01:23:49,061 --> 01:23:51,313
Not even our closest friends
knew about it.

1203
01:23:52,105 --> 01:23:54,608
He was protecting me.
I knew about his work.

1204
01:23:54,858 --> 01:23:58,195
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife,
it'd be dangerous for me...

1205
01:23:58,445 --> 01:23:59,905
...and for those working with us.

1206
01:24:00,697 --> 01:24:02,866
When did you first find out
he was alive?

1207
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,495
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris.

1208
01:24:06,745 --> 01:24:09,247
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1209
01:24:09,539 --> 01:24:12,793
They hid him in a freight car
in the outskirts of Paris.

1210
01:24:13,043 --> 01:24:15,045
He was sick. He needed me.

1211
01:24:16,546 --> 01:24:18,632
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1212
01:24:18,882 --> 01:24:23,595
I knew you wouldn't have left and the
Gestapo would have caught you, so I...

1213
01:24:26,473 --> 01:24:28,558
Well, you know the rest.

1214
01:24:30,977 --> 01:24:33,605
It's still a story without an ending.

1215
01:24:34,356 --> 01:24:35,148
What about now?

1216
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:37,692
Now?

1217
01:24:38,527 --> 01:24:40,070
I don't know.

1218
01:24:40,821 --> 01:24:43,407
I know I'll never have
the strength to leave you again.

1219
01:24:44,658 --> 01:24:45,700
And Laszlo?

1220
01:24:46,076 --> 01:24:49,287
You'll help him now, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1221
01:24:49,538 --> 01:24:52,791
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1222
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:54,876
All except one.

1223
01:24:56,002 --> 01:24:57,587
He won't have you.

1224
01:24:59,506 --> 01:25:01,758
I can't fight it anymore.

1225
01:25:03,176 --> 01:25:06,138
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1226
01:25:08,765 --> 01:25:11,518
I don't know what's right any longer.

1227
01:25:11,768 --> 01:25:14,271
You have to think for both of us.

1228
01:25:14,771 --> 01:25:16,231
For all of us.

1229
01:25:19,776 --> 01:25:20,861
All right.

1230
01:25:21,111 --> 01:25:22,487
I will.

1231
01:25:26,533 --> 01:25:28,452
Here's looking at you, kid.

1232
01:25:30,162 --> 01:25:33,040
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1233
01:25:45,552 --> 01:25:47,679
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1234
01:25:47,929 --> 01:25:49,431
They caught some of the others.

1235
01:25:49,723 --> 01:25:51,016
Come inside.

1236
01:25:55,395 --> 01:25:59,733
Come, Mr. Laszlo.
I will help you immediately.

1237
01:26:04,029 --> 01:26:06,198
I'll give you some water.

1238
01:26:19,669 --> 01:26:21,421
Carl, what happened?

1239
01:26:21,922 --> 01:26:25,634
The police break up our meeting.
We escaped in the last moment.

1240
01:26:25,926 --> 01:26:28,136
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1241
01:26:28,345 --> 01:26:31,681
Turn out the light at the rear.
It may attract police.

1242
01:26:31,932 --> 01:26:33,266
Sascha always puts it out.

1243
01:26:33,517 --> 01:26:34,434
Tonight he forgot.

1244
01:26:35,185 --> 01:26:37,270
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1245
01:26:45,112 --> 01:26:46,780
Take Miss Lund home.

1246
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:48,323
Yes, sir.

1247
01:26:59,459 --> 01:27:02,337
Just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1248
01:27:02,546 --> 01:27:04,548
This might come in handy.

1249
01:27:04,798 --> 01:27:05,966
Thank you.

1250
01:27:06,216 --> 01:27:07,342
Had a close one?

1251
01:27:07,551 --> 01:27:08,802
Yes, rather.

1252
01:27:10,804 --> 01:27:13,515
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1253
01:27:13,724 --> 01:27:15,851
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1254
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,770
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1255
01:27:18,979 --> 01:27:20,272
We stop breathing, we'll die.

1256
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,524
We stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1257
01:27:22,774 --> 01:27:25,485
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1258
01:27:25,736 --> 01:27:27,738
You know how you sound?

1259
01:27:28,029 --> 01:27:32,159
Like a man who's convincing himself
of something he doesn't believe.

1260
01:27:32,409 --> 01:27:33,493
Each of us has a destiny.

1261
01:27:34,411 --> 01:27:36,204
For good or for evil.

1262
01:27:36,413 --> 01:27:37,330
I get the point.

1263
01:27:37,664 --> 01:27:39,124
I wonder if you do.

1264
01:27:39,332 --> 01:27:42,502
I wonder if you know you're trying
to escape from yourself.

1265
01:27:42,753 --> 01:27:44,087
You'll never succeed.

1266
01:27:44,504 --> 01:27:47,340
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1267
01:27:48,383 --> 01:27:51,136
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1268
01:27:51,344 --> 01:27:53,555
I know that you're
in love with a woman.

1269
01:27:53,764 --> 01:27:55,724
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1270
01:27:55,932 --> 01:27:58,018
...that we're in love
with the same woman.

1271
01:27:58,602 --> 01:28:00,937
The first evening
I came into this café...

1272
01:28:01,188 --> 01:28:04,066
...I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1273
01:28:04,274 --> 01:28:06,151
Since no one is to blame...

1274
01:28:06,443 --> 01:28:08,403
...I demand no explanation.

1275
01:28:08,653 --> 01:28:11,907
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters...

1276
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:13,075
...all right.

1277
01:28:13,784 --> 01:28:15,786
But I want my wife to be safe.

1278
01:28:15,994 --> 01:28:17,287
I ask you as a favor...

1279
01:28:17,537 --> 01:28:20,540
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1280
01:28:20,791 --> 01:28:21,666
You love her that much?

1281
01:28:22,125 --> 01:28:25,295
Apparently, you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1282
01:28:26,421 --> 01:28:28,548
I'm also a human being.

1283
01:28:28,882 --> 01:28:30,217
Yes, I love her that much.

1284
01:28:38,058 --> 01:28:39,351
- Mr. Laszlo?
- Yes?

1285
01:28:39,559 --> 01:28:42,020
Come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1286
01:28:42,312 --> 01:28:43,105
On what charge?

1287
01:28:43,313 --> 01:28:45,482
The captain will discuss
that with you later.

1288
01:28:45,732 --> 01:28:48,402
It seems that destiny
has taken a hand.

1289
01:29:00,414 --> 01:29:04,459
You haven't any proof.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1290
01:29:04,668 --> 01:29:08,505
You can fine him and give him 30 days.
You might as well let him go.

1291
01:29:08,755 --> 01:29:11,842
I advise you not to be interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1292
01:29:12,092 --> 01:29:13,635
If you help him to escape...

1293
01:29:13,844 --> 01:29:15,971
Why do you think I'd stick
my neck out for him?

1294
01:29:16,179 --> 01:29:18,724
Because, one, you bet
10,000 francs he'd escape.

1295
01:29:19,015 --> 01:29:22,102
Two, you've got the letters.
Don't bother to deny it.

1296
01:29:22,352 --> 01:29:25,147
You might do it because
you don't like Strasser's looks.

1297
01:29:25,355 --> 01:29:27,023
I don't like them either.

1298
01:29:27,607 --> 01:29:28,817
They're all excellent reasons.

1299
01:29:29,025 --> 01:29:30,986
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1300
01:29:31,194 --> 01:29:32,654
In this matter, I'm powerless.

1301
01:29:32,863 --> 01:29:34,614
Besides, I might lose 10,000 francs.

1302
01:29:34,865 --> 01:29:39,536
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1303
01:29:39,786 --> 01:29:41,204
Yes, I have the letters.

1304
01:29:41,496 --> 01:29:43,415
I intend using them myself.

1305
01:29:43,707 --> 01:29:47,085
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1306
01:29:47,377 --> 01:29:50,380
I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1307
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:52,507
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1308
01:29:52,799 --> 01:29:56,261
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1309
01:29:56,553 --> 01:29:58,472
The last man I want to see in America.

1310
01:29:58,722 --> 01:30:00,348
You didn't come here to say this.

1311
01:30:00,557 --> 01:30:01,808
You have the letters.

1312
01:30:02,059 --> 01:30:05,228
Fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1313
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:08,065
Why do you still care
what happens to Laszlo?

1314
01:30:08,315 --> 01:30:12,402
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1315
01:30:12,652 --> 01:30:16,156
We have a legal right to go,
but people have been held here...

1316
01:30:16,406 --> 01:30:18,366
...in spite of their legal rights.

1317
01:30:18,575 --> 01:30:20,243
Why do you think
we want to hold you?

1318
01:30:20,535 --> 01:30:21,828
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1319
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,956
She probably knows things
Strasser would like to know.

1320
01:30:25,165 --> 01:30:26,625
I'll make a deal with you.

1321
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:30,670
Instead of this petty charge,
you could get something really big...

1322
01:30:30,921 --> 01:30:33,590
...that would chuck him
in a camp for years.

1323
01:30:33,757 --> 01:30:35,175
That'd be a feather in your cap.

1324
01:30:35,425 --> 01:30:38,595
It certainly would. Germany...
Vichy would be grateful.

1325
01:30:38,845 --> 01:30:39,846
Then release him.

1326
01:30:40,097 --> 01:30:42,682
Be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1327
01:30:42,933 --> 01:30:45,394
Laszlo will come there
to pick up the letters.

1328
01:30:45,644 --> 01:30:48,188
That'll give you the grounds
to make the arrest.

1329
01:30:48,522 --> 01:30:50,774
You get him, and we get away.

1330
01:30:51,024 --> 01:30:53,860
To the Germans, that last
will be just a minor annoyance.

1331
01:30:54,111 --> 01:30:56,863
There's still something
I don't understand.

1332
01:30:57,197 --> 01:30:59,825
Miss Lund,
she is very beautiful, yes...

1333
01:31:00,033 --> 01:31:02,285
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1334
01:31:02,536 --> 01:31:03,954
She isn't just any woman.

1335
01:31:04,204 --> 01:31:05,455
I see.

1336
01:31:05,706 --> 01:31:07,791
How do I know you'll keep
your bargain?

1337
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:10,752
I'll make the arrangements
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1338
01:31:10,961 --> 01:31:15,716
I'm gonna miss you. You're the only one
here who has even less scruples than I.

1339
01:31:16,133 --> 01:31:17,426
Thanks.

1340
01:31:17,968 --> 01:31:18,927
Go ahead, Ricky.

1341
01:31:19,219 --> 01:31:23,640
Call off your watchdogs when you let
him go. I don't want them around today.

1342
01:31:23,890 --> 01:31:26,184
I'm taking no chances,
not even with you.

1343
01:31:33,734 --> 01:31:36,111
Should we draw it up,
or is a handshake good enough?

1344
01:31:36,403 --> 01:31:39,823
Certainly not good enough. But since
I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1345
01:31:40,073 --> 01:31:43,493
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and
go to America! You're a lucky man.

1346
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:47,205
My agreement with Sam is
that he gets 25% of the profits.

1347
01:31:47,414 --> 01:31:49,082
That still goes.

1348
01:31:49,332 --> 01:31:51,877
I happen to know he gets 10%.
But he's worth 25.

1349
01:31:52,085 --> 01:31:55,047
Abdul, Carl and Sascha stay
with the place or I don't sell.

1350
01:31:55,338 --> 01:31:58,050
Of course. Rick's
wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1351
01:31:58,258 --> 01:31:59,176
So long.

1352
01:31:59,676 --> 01:32:02,220
Remember you owe Rick's
100 cartons of cigarettes.

1353
01:32:02,512 --> 01:32:04,890
I shall remember
to pay it to myself.

1354
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:42,886
- You're late.
- I was informed as he left the hotel.

1355
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:44,262
So I'm on time.

1356
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:47,474
- I said to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed.

1357
01:32:47,724 --> 01:32:49,768
This place won't
be the same without you.

1358
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:53,230
I've already spoken to Ferrari.
You'll still win at roulette.

1359
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,564
Is everything ready?

1360
01:32:54,815 --> 01:32:56,149
I have the letters here.

1361
01:32:56,483 --> 01:32:58,568
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1362
01:32:58,819 --> 01:33:00,153
Sam's piano.

1363
01:33:00,904 --> 01:33:02,781
Serves me right
for not being musical.

1364
01:33:03,073 --> 01:33:04,032
Here they are.

1365
01:33:04,574 --> 01:33:06,410
You better wait in my office.

1366
01:33:15,919 --> 01:33:18,588
Victor thinks I'm going with him.
Haven't you told him?

1367
01:33:18,839 --> 01:33:21,007
- Not yet.
- But it's all right, isn't it?

1368
01:33:21,258 --> 01:33:22,676
Everything's quite all right.

1369
01:33:22,926 --> 01:33:26,972
We'll tell him at the airport. The less
time to think, the easier. Trust me.

1370
01:33:30,016 --> 01:33:31,268
Yes, I will.

1371
01:33:36,189 --> 01:33:40,444
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We still have a lot to do.

1372
01:33:42,195 --> 01:33:45,615
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1373
01:33:45,866 --> 01:33:47,701
- We made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1374
01:33:47,951 --> 01:33:49,453
You won't have
trouble in Lisbon?

1375
01:33:49,953 --> 01:33:51,079
No. It's all arranged.

1376
01:33:51,288 --> 01:33:53,373
Good. The letters are
made out in blank.

1377
01:33:53,623 --> 01:33:56,043
All you have to do is
fill in the signatures.

1378
01:33:56,543 --> 01:33:57,794
Victor Laszlo...

1379
01:33:58,378 --> 01:33:59,963
...you're under arrest.

1380
01:34:03,884 --> 01:34:07,679
For accessory to the murder of the
couriers from whom these were stolen.

1381
01:34:08,472 --> 01:34:11,725
You're surprised about Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1382
01:34:11,975 --> 01:34:14,686
Love, it seems, has triumphed
over virtue. Thank...

1383
01:34:15,562 --> 01:34:19,941
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's gonna
be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1384
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:23,195
- Have you taken leave of your senses?
- I have. Sit down.

1385
01:34:23,403 --> 01:34:26,448
I don't want to shoot you,
but I will if you take one more step.

1386
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:30,035
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1387
01:34:32,412 --> 01:34:33,205
Keep your hands down.

1388
01:34:33,413 --> 01:34:36,083
I wonder if you realize
what this means?

1389
01:34:36,333 --> 01:34:38,418
I do. We'll discuss that later.

1390
01:34:38,668 --> 01:34:40,170
Call off the watchdogs, you said.

1391
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:42,631
Call the airport.
You tell them.

1392
01:34:42,923 --> 01:34:45,509
Remember, this gun is pointed
right at your heart.

1393
01:34:45,759 --> 01:34:48,387
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1394
01:34:55,519 --> 01:34:57,437
Hello? Is that the airport?

1395
01:34:58,855 --> 01:35:00,315
Capt. Renault speaking.

1396
01:35:00,607 --> 01:35:03,193
There'll be two
letters of transit for Lisbon.

1397
01:35:03,443 --> 01:35:05,362
There's to be no trouble about them.

1398
01:35:05,779 --> 01:35:06,571
Good.

1399
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:14,830
My car, quickly.

1400
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:17,582
This is Strasser.

1401
01:35:17,791 --> 01:35:20,001
Have police meet me
at the airport at once.

1402
01:35:20,293 --> 01:35:21,962
At once, do you hear?

1403
01:35:28,802 --> 01:35:30,762
Hello, radio tower?

1404
01:35:31,054 --> 01:35:34,015
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1405
01:35:34,391 --> 01:35:36,810
Visibility one and one-half miles.

1406
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:38,270
Light ground fog.

1407
01:35:38,562 --> 01:35:40,856
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1408
01:35:41,148 --> 01:35:43,442
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1409
01:35:56,246 --> 01:35:58,832
Have him go with Laszlo
to take care of his luggage.

1410
01:35:59,082 --> 01:36:01,084
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1411
01:36:01,334 --> 01:36:04,296
Find Mr. Laszlo's luggage
and put it on the plane.

1412
01:36:04,755 --> 01:36:05,714
This way, please.

1413
01:36:07,674 --> 01:36:10,594
Fill in the names.
That'll make it even more official.

1414
01:36:10,844 --> 01:36:13,055
You think of everything, don't you?

1415
01:36:13,346 --> 01:36:15,599
The names are
Mr. And Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1416
01:36:15,849 --> 01:36:16,683
But...

1417
01:36:16,933 --> 01:36:17,893
...why my name?

1418
01:36:18,101 --> 01:36:19,561
You're getting on that plane.

1419
01:36:19,770 --> 01:36:20,937
But what about you?

1420
01:36:21,188 --> 01:36:23,231
I'm staying here
till the plane gets away.

1421
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,192
What's happened to you?
Last night...

1422
01:36:25,442 --> 01:36:27,652
Last night we said
a great many things.

1423
01:36:27,861 --> 01:36:29,571
You said I was to do the thinking
for us.

1424
01:36:29,863 --> 01:36:32,074
I've done a lot.
It all adds up to one thing:

1425
01:36:32,366 --> 01:36:35,202
You're getting on that plane with Victor
where you belong.

1426
01:36:35,452 --> 01:36:37,371
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1427
01:36:37,621 --> 01:36:40,207
Do you know what you'd have
to look forward to here?

1428
01:36:40,457 --> 01:36:44,169
We'd both wind up in a
concentration camp. Isn't that true?

1429
01:36:44,461 --> 01:36:46,171
Maj. Strasser would insist.

1430
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:49,841
- You're saying this to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1431
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:52,177
Inside we both know
you belong with Victor.

1432
01:36:52,386 --> 01:36:54,721
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1433
01:36:54,971 --> 01:36:57,808
If that plane leaves and you're not
with him, you'll regret it.

1434
01:36:58,058 --> 01:37:01,436
Maybe not today, not tomorrow,
but soon. For the rest of your life.

1435
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:03,522
But what about us?

1436
01:37:04,648 --> 01:37:06,066
We'll always have Paris.

1437
01:37:06,316 --> 01:37:09,319
We didn't have. We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1438
01:37:09,569 --> 01:37:11,655
We got it back last night.

1439
01:37:12,489 --> 01:37:15,992
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1440
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:18,161
I've got a job to do too.

1441
01:37:18,412 --> 01:37:21,873
Where I go, you can't follow.
What I have to do, you can't be part of.

1442
01:37:22,582 --> 01:37:24,167
I'm no good at being noble.

1443
01:37:24,418 --> 01:37:27,504
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three people...

1444
01:37:27,754 --> 01:37:30,590
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1445
01:37:30,841 --> 01:37:32,926
Someday you'll understand that.

1446
01:37:38,014 --> 01:37:40,100
Here's looking at you, kid.

1447
01:37:55,449 --> 01:37:57,826
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1448
01:37:58,035 --> 01:38:00,162
There's something you should know.

1449
01:38:00,370 --> 01:38:02,122
I don't ask you
to explain anything.

1450
01:38:02,372 --> 01:38:04,958
It may make a difference
to you later on.

1451
01:38:05,292 --> 01:38:07,419
You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

1452
01:38:07,794 --> 01:38:10,297
She was at my place
last night when you were.

1453
01:38:10,547 --> 01:38:13,175
She came there for the letters.
Isn't that true?

1454
01:38:14,551 --> 01:38:15,343
Yes.

1455
01:38:16,136 --> 01:38:18,013
She tried everything.
Nothing worked.

1456
01:38:18,305 --> 01:38:21,975
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1457
01:38:22,225 --> 01:38:24,644
But that was all over long ago.

1458
01:38:24,895 --> 01:38:27,814
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't.
I let her pretend.

1459
01:38:28,899 --> 01:38:29,941
I understand.

1460
01:38:30,317 --> 01:38:31,109
Here it is.

1461
01:38:31,651 --> 01:38:32,444
Thanks.

1462
01:38:33,236 --> 01:38:34,821
I appreciate it.

1463
01:38:35,989 --> 01:38:37,616
Welcome back to the fight.

1464
01:38:37,824 --> 01:38:40,202
This time I know our side will win.

1465
01:38:54,174 --> 01:38:55,175
Are you ready?

1466
01:38:58,178 --> 01:38:59,346
Yes, I'm ready.

1467
01:39:02,766 --> 01:39:03,809
Goodbye, Rick.

1468
01:39:04,851 --> 01:39:06,353
God bless you.

1469
01:39:08,105 --> 01:39:10,607
Better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1470
01:39:28,709 --> 01:39:30,460
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1471
01:39:30,711 --> 01:39:32,254
Stay where you are.

1472
01:39:32,546 --> 01:39:35,298
- I don't know what you mean.
- What you did for Laszlo.

1473
01:39:35,549 --> 01:39:37,676
And that fairy tale
to send Ilsa away with him.

1474
01:39:37,884 --> 01:39:41,805
I know a little about women. She went,
but she knew you were lying.

1475
01:39:42,806 --> 01:39:44,558
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1476
01:39:44,808 --> 01:39:47,269
This isn't going to be
pleasant for either of us.

1477
01:39:47,561 --> 01:39:49,104
Especially for you.

1478
01:39:49,396 --> 01:39:50,647
I'll have to arrest you.

1479
01:39:50,981 --> 01:39:52,733
As soon as the plane goes.

1480
01:40:00,073 --> 01:40:02,075
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

1481
01:40:02,325 --> 01:40:04,077
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1482
01:40:06,747 --> 01:40:08,707
Why do you stand here?
Why not stop him?

1483
01:40:08,999 --> 01:40:10,917
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1484
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:14,629
Get away from that phone.

1485
01:40:14,838 --> 01:40:16,089
Do not interfere.

1486
01:40:16,339 --> 01:40:18,425
I was willing to shoot Renault.
I'll shoot you.

1487
01:40:22,179 --> 01:40:23,055
Put that phone down.

1488
01:40:23,263 --> 01:40:25,182
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1489
01:40:40,197 --> 01:40:41,698
Maj. Strasser has been shot.

1490
01:40:46,703 --> 01:40:48,955
Round up the usual suspects.

1491
01:41:12,979 --> 01:41:16,483
You're not only a sentimentalist,
but you've become a patriot.

1492
01:41:16,733 --> 01:41:18,777
Maybe. It seemed like
a good time to start.

1493
01:41:18,985 --> 01:41:21,071
I think perhaps you're right.

1494
01:41:46,179 --> 01:41:49,850
It might be good for you to disappear
from Casablanca for a while.

1495
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:52,310
There's a Free French garrison
at Brazzaville.

1496
01:41:52,602 --> 01:41:54,187
I could arrange passage.

1497
01:41:54,855 --> 01:41:56,440
My letter of transit?

1498
01:41:56,690 --> 01:41:57,858
I could use a trip.

1499
01:41:58,108 --> 01:42:01,236
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1500
01:42:01,528 --> 01:42:04,489
And that 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1501
01:42:04,698 --> 01:42:06,533
"Our" expenses?

1502
01:42:06,783 --> 01:42:07,826
Louis...

1503
01:42:08,035 --> 01:42:11,747
...I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

1504
01:42:30,807 --> 01:42:31,850
