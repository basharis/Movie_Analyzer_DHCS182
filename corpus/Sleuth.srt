1
00:01:52,865 --> 00:01:54,523
-Yes?
-Andrew Wyke?

2
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,576
That's right.

3
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:58,938
I'm Milo Tindle.

4
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:01,789
Oh, yes, good.

5
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,767
Glad to meet you.

6
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:11,513
You got the train to Charlebury,
did you?

7
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:13,917
-I drove.
-Oh, you drove?

8
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,193
That's my car.

9
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:17,183
Oh, the little one?

10
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,996
-Not the big one.
-No, the big one's mine.

11
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:22,015
What do you think of it?

12
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:27,199
-Very handsome.
-Yeah.

13
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,432
It is, isn't it?

14
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,689
Come in.

15
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:41,912
I was watching a video
of one of my books on television.

16
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:48,860
Like the house?

17
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:50,453
Extraordinary.

18
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:54,235
You know who designed it,
who the interior decorator was?

19
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,668
Yes, your wife.

20
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:58,238
You knew?

21
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,025
Yes, I knew.

22
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:02,134
I'll show you around later.

23
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:03,897
Have a drink. I'm drinking vodka.

24
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:06,616
-Scotch, please.
-Scotch.

25
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:10,132
Milo, what an interesting name.
You're a foreigner, I take it?

26
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:12,692
My father's Italian.

27
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:15,002
Milo sounds Hungarian.

28
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,760
Does it?

29
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:19,221
Here's your Scotch.

30
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,319
Cheers.

31
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:25,211
Cheers.

32
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:29,814
You sure your father
isn't Hungarian?

33
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:32,732
Well, if he is,
he's kept it a dead secret for years.

34
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:35,415
-And your mother?
-English.

35
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,971
So you're a kind of half-breed?

36
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,922
Sit down.

37
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,679
-Thanks for agreeing to see me.
-Not at all.

38
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:52,853
I didn't know you wrote plays
for television.

39
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:55,389
I don't. I write crime novels.
You must know that.

40
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,532
I had heard.

41
00:03:56,702 --> 00:04:00,051
But sometimes they're adapted
for television by other people.

42
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:02,393
You know what the word
adapted means, I take it?

43
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:04,314
Adapted?

44
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,452
They may not have such a word
in Italian.

45
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,372
-I speak English.
-Good.

46
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:12,850
Come and have a look
at my special book room.

47
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,384
These are all my novels.

48
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,492
You've read them, I suppose?

49
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,450
Afraid not.

50
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:29,500
Good God, no?
What about this one?

51
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,865
-Rat in a Trap?
-No.

52
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:33,590
-The Obelisk?
-No.

53
00:04:33,757 --> 00:04:34,740
-Blackout?
-No.

54
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:37,298
-Dead Fish?
-Afraid not.

55
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:39,257
God, you're one in a million.

56
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:43,251
-Am l?
-Oh, absolu-- I'm very popular.

57
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:45,363
You see this shelf?

58
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,410
Translations.

59
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:50,876
French, Dutch, German.

60
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,760
You speak Dutch yourself, do you?

61
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:55,958
Yes, how did you know?
I have a Dutch uncle.

62
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,979
Can't see any Italian translations.

63
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:02,166
No, they're a funny lot, the Italians.
Culture isn't really their thing.

64
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:03,641
Their salami's good, though.

65
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,423
-Oh, is it?
-Italian salami? Best in the world.

66
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:08,344
Did you bring any with you?

67
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,548
-No, I left it at home.
-Oh, shame.

68
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,407
We're gonna have it
for supper tonight.

69
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:14,360
With a couple of bottles
of Valpolicella.

70
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:17,372
-We?
-Maggie and me.

71
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:21,338
Your glass is empty.
What were you drinking, vodka?

72
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,922
-Scotch.
-Scotch.

73
00:05:35,228 --> 00:05:37,300
I want to come to the point.

74
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,743
Point? What point?

75
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:40,730
Are you gonna give Maggie
a divorce?

76
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:42,168
And if not, why not?

77
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:44,665
Yeah, yes, yes, we'll come to that.

78
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,737
She thinks
you're being unreasonable.

79
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,434
So do l.

80
00:05:48,603 --> 00:05:51,669
She's never coming back to you,
so why not just give her the divorce?

81
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:55,097
It'll do her good to wait for five years.
Good for her character.

82
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,681
You're going to make her wait
five years?

83
00:05:57,851 --> 00:06:01,200
- That's the law. The law of the land.
-But that's pure spite.

84
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:05,463
Anyway, we'll get back to that,
perhaps. Have your drink first.

85
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,899
What do you do, by the way?

86
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:12,561
I'm an actor.

87
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:15,033
Good God. Are you really?

88
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:17,845
I thought Maggie said
you were a hairdresser.

89
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,050
She must have been talking
about someone else.

90
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,648
You mean another friend?

91
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,226
Another friend?

92
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:25,077
She tends to have
more than one friend.

93
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:26,453
-Does she?
-Oh, yes.

94
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,960
I'm her only friend.

95
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:29,584
She must be lonely.

96
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:31,315
She's not.

97
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:35,028
Acting is a pretty precarious
profession, isn't it?

98
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,398
What are you acting in
at the moment?

99
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:39,350
I'm out of work.

100
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:40,496
Poor chap.

101
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,284
I drive cars now and again,
chauffeuring.

102
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,784
-Oh, tough life.
-I keep my head above water.

103
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:49,365
What sort of parts do you play?

104
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,560
Killers, mostly.

105
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,664
Sex maniacs, perverts.

106
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,361
But you're so charming.

107
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,050
Yes, I know.
Anyway, what about this divorce?

108
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:02,356
What's your position, exactly?

109
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,888
All in good time.

110
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,962
Come in.

111
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:24,601
Have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

112
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:32,750
I understand you're fucking my wife.

113
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:34,961
-That's right.
-Right.

114
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,722
Yes, right.

115
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,928
-So we've cleared that up.
-We have.

116
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:41,201
-I thought you might deny it.
-Why would I deny it?

117
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:44,118
-Well, she is my wife.
-Yes, but she's fucking me.

118
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:46,866
Oh, she's fucking you too?
Well, I'll be buggered.

119
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:49,331
-Sorry.
-Yes, it's mutual.

120
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:51,122
-You take turns?
-We fuck each other.

121
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:54,998
-That's what people do.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I follow.

122
00:07:57,816 --> 00:08:00,271
-We're in love.
-You're in love?

123
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:01,875
That's right.

124
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,406
Let me top you up.

125
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,611
I heard a rumor
that you wanted to marry her.

126
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:20,663
-That can't be true, can it?
-Why not?

127
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:23,606
In this day and age,
is marriage absolutely necessary?

128
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:24,782
Isn't it a bit old hat?

129
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:26,740
-ls it?
-It's a mug's game.

130
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:29,424
I wouldn't go near it if I were you.
You can't marry her.

131
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,696
You can't marry her
because she's married to me.

132
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:33,489
Unless I divorce her, of course.

133
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:35,598
-And are you?
-Am I what?

134
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:36,815
Going to divorce her?

135
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,991
Are you really gonna
make her wait five years?

136
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,942
-She wants to know.
-To be honest, I can't wait.

137
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:45,170
But there are one or two things
I'd like to clear up first.

138
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:49,808
For example, I've never heard
of an Italian called Tindle.

139
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:51,382
My father's name is Tindolini.

140
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:54,740
Now, that's lovely.
That's like a little bell.

141
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:57,805
Why don't you go back to Tindolini?
It suits you.

142
00:08:57,975 --> 00:08:59,381
-You think so?
-Yes.

143
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:03,983
So if and when you marry Maggie,
she'll be Maggie Tindolini.

144
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:06,517
Do you get a kick out of that?

145
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:09,330
What name do you act under?
Tindle or Tindolini?

146
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:11,404
-Tindle.
-Why have I never heard of you?

147
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:12,851
You will before long.

148
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:14,803
-Really?
-In spades.

149
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:16,559
-That sounds threatening.
-Does it?

150
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:18,133
Doesn't it?

151
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,536
Why don't we get down
to brass tacks?

152
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:26,517
Brass tacks, yes. Why not?

153
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,938
This is the way I see it.

154
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:32,590
Come upstairs.

155
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:35,476
I want to show you something.

156
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:42,254
Are you all right in elevators?

157
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:48,143
It won't make you sick
or anything, will it?

158
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,579
This is our bedroom.

159
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:12,434
And this is my wife's dressing room.

160
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:16,751
She left a few dresses.
Couldn't be bothered to pick them up.

161
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:20,113
They're worth thousands.
Thousands.

162
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:23,789
This leather coat alone
is worth 5000 quid.

163
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,405
So you see, the thing is this.
Sit down.

164
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,947
The thing is this,
my wife spends money like water.

165
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:37,298
So if you're not careful,
she'll eat you out of house and home.

166
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,591
She was born to luxury, you know.
Jamaica, the Ritz, the Swiss Alps.

167
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:44,401
What are you?
Out-of-work actor, part-time chauffeur.

168
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:47,467
You're out of your depth, old boy.
You're on a hiding to nothing.

169
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:49,229
If you think you're broke now...

170
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:52,462
...you'll be 10 times broker
by the time she's finished with you.

171
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:54,351
She'll have your guts for garters.

172
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:58,730
-She's in love with me.
-Oh, never trust in love, chum.

173
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,747
Love will kick you up the arse
as soon as look at you.

174
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:05,290
One minute, it's love,
10 minutes later, it's contempt.

175
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,020
That's your own experience, is it?

176
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:09,871
Oh, no, no, no, that's observation.

177
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,240
Don't forget, I'm a novelist.

178
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:14,771
I observe people.

179
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,446
What I'm getting at is you won't
be able to give her what she wants.

180
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:21,361
So she's gonna leave you,
come back to me.

181
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:23,978
I don't want her near me.
That's the last thing I want.

182
00:11:24,147 --> 00:11:25,903
I've had her up to here.

183
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:30,093
Anyway, I've got this lovely mistress.
She runs a sauna in Swindon.

184
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,274
She's my girl.

185
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:34,291
So you see,
I want Maggie to stay with you.

186
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:37,200
I want you two
to be together forever.

187
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,705
But unless you listen to me...

188
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,972
...the whole thing
will be a fucking disaster...

189
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:44,521
...with catastrophic consequences
all round.

190
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,772
But I have a solution.

191
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,490
You won't believe
what I'm gonna say.

192
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:00,361
What are you gonna say?

193
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,897
I'm all ears.

194
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:04,520
You know something?

195
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,513
I'm beginning to respond
to your charm.

196
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,104
-Get away.
-No, it's true.

197
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:11,591
-I'm really touched.
-You should be.

198
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:14,926
Tell me, I bet you didn't expect me
to be so intelligent.

199
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,945
So quick-witted, did you?

200
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:19,178
Oh, I did.

201
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:21,135
Quite.

202
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,849
Maggie told you, did she?

203
00:12:27,953 --> 00:12:29,961
What's your solution?

204
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:36,328
It's a close fit, isn't it?

205
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:38,253
For two.

206
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,677
Listen, I'm going
to make you a proposition.

207
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:52,974
A few years ago,
I gave her some jewels.

208
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:55,374
Amazingly expensive.

209
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:59,311
I didn't give them to her, I own them.
They're insured in my name.

210
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:02,702
But I let her use them
on special occasions.

211
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,614
They're worth 1 million pounds.

212
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:08,843
They spend half the time in the bank,
half the time in the safe.

213
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:13,678
At the moment, they're here
in the house, in the safe.

214
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,769
And I want you to steal them.

215
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:24,230
-Steal them?
-That's right.

216
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:27,851
-What the hell do you mean?
-I want you to steal the jewels.

217
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:30,351
You want me to steal the jewels?
I don't get it.

218
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:33,065
It's simple. You steal the jewels,
sell them abroad...

219
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:35,883
...and you live happily ever after
with Maggie.

220
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,504
I get rid of my wife
and I'll be like a pig in shit.

221
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:41,869
You can keep Maggie in the manner
to which she's become accustomed.

222
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:45,196
You want me to take part
in a scummy little plot...

223
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,531
...to defraud your insurance company,
is that it?

224
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,190
I thought it was quite elegant.

225
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,854
What do you think I am?

226
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:53,479
What the fuck
are you actually talking about?

227
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:55,982
-These are real facts.
-This is a joke.

228
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:57,126
-No.
-It's also a trap.

229
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,856
-A trap?
-Yes. You think I'm a fool.

230
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,234
Well, are you?

231
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,676
-It doesn't hold up.
-Why not?

232
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,188
They're worth a million pounds. You'd
get a fraction of that from any fence.

233
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:08,359
I have already contacted
a friend of mine in Amsterdam.

234
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:13,895
And he will give you
800,000 pounds tax-free.

235
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:16,005
Now, think about it.

236
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,662
Eight hundred thousand pounds...

237
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:20,806
...tax-free.

238
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,553
Why would he do that?

239
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:27,369
When you steal the jewels,
you will also steal the receipts.

240
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:31,081
So he'll have title to the jewels
as well as the jewels themselves...

241
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:33,767
...so that when he sells them,
he gets full value.

242
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:38,859
Got it?

243
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:40,746
Think about it.

244
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:42,950
Take your time.

245
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:02,924
And why would you do all this?

246
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:07,625
Listen, under this crooked exterior,
I am a simple, honest man.

247
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,270
Every word I've told you is true,
I swear it.

248
00:15:11,438 --> 00:15:16,708
I want to get rid of my wife,
but I want it to be solid, permanent.

249
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:19,780
I don't want her on my back.
I want her to stay on your back.

250
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:21,378
This is a frame-up.

251
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,786
-A frame-up?
-Yes.

252
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:26,405
You want to destroy me.

253
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:27,784
You want to see me in jail.

254
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,298
You want me to do this
and then shop me to the police.

255
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:32,647
No, no, no.

256
00:15:32,814 --> 00:15:36,970
If I shop you, then you'll shop me,
and then we'll both end up in jail.

257
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:39,500
No, I take a strictly moral position
on all this.

258
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,603
My wife is an adulteress.

259
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:43,977
Actually,
she should be stoned to death.

260
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:46,791
Anyway, it's up to you.
Make up your own mind.

261
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:48,299
You're asking me to trust you?

262
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:50,348
I don't give a fuck
if you trust me or not.

263
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:52,035
This is a simple proposition.

264
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:54,725
You have an expensive woman
and no money.

265
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:57,828
You wanna keep the woman,
steal the jewels.

266
00:15:57,996 --> 00:16:01,673
Why don't you steal the jewels
and give them to me?

267
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,397
Don't be a bloody fool.

268
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:06,860
The burglary has to be right.
The house has to be broken into.

269
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:09,672
-Why don't you break into it?
-For chrissake, I'm in it.

270
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:12,520
How can I break into it? I live here.

271
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:40,353
Okay.

272
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:46,153
If I were to agree to do this,
would you agree to the divorce?

273
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:47,941
Why should I give her the divorce...

274
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,409
...if you're both walking away
with 800,000 pounds?

275
00:16:50,572 --> 00:16:52,644
She wants a legal settlement.

276
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,201
-She wants part of your estate.
-Greedy.

277
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:57,030
That's legal justice.

278
00:16:57,195 --> 00:16:59,366
Never trust in legal justice.

279
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:01,319
You know what legal justice is?

280
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:05,313
It's farting "Annie Laurie"
through a keyhole.

281
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:10,786
Listen, 800,000 pounds...

282
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:12,132
...tax-free.

283
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,209
All yours, in cash.

284
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:18,023
-Why don't you stop pissing around?
-But wait a minute.

285
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:21,001
You get a million
from the insurance.

286
00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:22,591
Sure I do.

287
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:25,380
Well, all right, I'll be frank.

288
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:29,124
I need it. Cash flow,
stocks, shares going down.

289
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,941
Get me? Quid pro quo.

290
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:35,751
You do me a favor, I do you a favor,
you keep the woman.

291
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,683
Okay.

292
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:42,025
Let's make a deal.

293
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,968
-What deal?
-I break in, I steal the jewels.

294
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,960
And you agree to the divorce.

295
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,800
That's the deal. Otherwise, fuck it.
That's another quid pro quo.

296
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:56,067
But you have to shake on it.

297
00:17:57,738 --> 00:17:59,330
All right.

298
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:01,474
I'll shake on it.

299
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:03,430
Here's my hand.

300
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:06,499
Okay.

301
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:11,591
Okay. So, what do I do?

302
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:13,826
You break in.

303
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,553
You see that skylight up there?

304
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:19,911
Well, that window there is the only one
that the burglar alarm doesn't touch.

305
00:18:20,073 --> 00:18:21,055
You get in there.

306
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,574
-That's pretty high up.
-Well, you climb a ladder.

307
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:26,600
-I'm not good at heights.
-You can do it.

308
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:28,671
Honestly, I know you can.

309
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,525
-You're having me on.
-Oh, come on. Behave like a man.

310
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:32,965
A man of action.

311
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:35,812
You don't have to be a hairdresser
for the rest of your life.

312
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:40,199
You can be free, independent,
take care of the woman you love.

313
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:41,823
Listen....

314
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:43,750
Put this on.

315
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:46,367
I use it to communicate
with my gardener.

316
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:53,188
Lovely. Actually, it suits you.

317
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:57,150
This is what you do. You go outside.

318
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,255
Across the lawn, there's a shed.
Behind the shed, there's a ladder.

319
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:03,207
You take the ladder, put it up
against the wall of the house...

320
00:19:03,368 --> 00:19:06,750
...and I direct you
through the earphone.

321
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,117
-Are you with me?
-Well, yes, yes.

322
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,668
-But I'm anxious and frightened.
-Trust me.

323
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,360
-But I don't.
-Well, trust me and all will be well.

324
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:19,173
Just follow my advice.
It's got to look real.

325
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:21,343
We have to convince
the insurance people...

326
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:23,650
...and the police,
if you see what I mean.

327
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:28,289
Maggie never told me
you were such a manipulator.

328
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:30,016
She told me
you were no good in bed.

329
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:32,159
But she never told me
you were a manipulator.

330
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:35,393
-She told you I was no good in bed?
-Oh, yes.

331
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,072
She was joking.
I'm wonderful in bed.

332
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,181
I must tell her.

333
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:54,435
-There's the shed across the lawn.
-Shed, yeah.

334
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:58,529
-There's the ladder behind the shed.
-The ladder?

335
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:00,929
The ladder.

336
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,804
Inside the shed,
there's a pair of gardening gloves.

337
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:07,422
Put them on. By the gardening gloves,
there's a hammer.

338
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,151
You go round the back of the house.

339
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,708
Put the ladder up against the wall
by the lower roof.

340
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,944
Then, carry the hammer up the ladder
on to the lower roof.

341
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,379
Then, you pull the ladder up
on to the main roof...

342
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:20,160
...and break the skylight window
with the hammer.

343
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:28,767
Wait a minute.
You've forgotten one major item.

344
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:30,789
What?

345
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,470
Once I'm in,
how do I get down to floor level?

346
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:35,875
Didn't I tell you? Oh, sorry.

347
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,947
You see that small metal door
up there?

348
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:39,841
Inside, there's an electric ladder.

349
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,494
You get through the window,
I press a button.

350
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:43,872
The ladder descends.

351
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:46,274
-You get on and climb down.
-Let me see it descend.

352
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:48,347
-What?
-Let me see it come down now.

353
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:49,979
Sure.

354
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:07,739
See? Easy as pissing.

355
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:15,297
-I have a funny feeling that I'm a cunt.
-Of course you're a cunt.

356
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:19,226
But so what?
You'll end up a wealthy man.

357
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:22,048
Obey the rules. Just obey the rules.

358
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:25,662
-Whose rules?
-My rules.

359
00:21:27,812 --> 00:21:29,885
Go and get the other ladder.

360
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,427
Can you see the ladder?

361
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:04,861
Can I see the ladder?

362
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:19,999
Place the ladder against the wall.

363
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:22,138
Okay.

364
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:25,920
Extend the ladder.

365
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,261
Okay.

366
00:22:31,235 --> 00:22:33,275
-Climb up the ladder.
-Okay!

367
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:40,376
Climb up the ladder.

368
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:43,294
Why am I doing this?

369
00:22:56,802 --> 00:22:59,617
Keep calm. Keep calm.

370
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,429
Keep coming. Keep coming.

371
00:23:02,594 --> 00:23:04,317
-Watch your step.
-Jesus.

372
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:13,370
Keep calm.

373
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:55,900
-Watch your step.
-I'm gonna die.

374
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:58,337
Fuck.

375
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:01,592
Don't stop. Keep going.

376
00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:04,215
Don't look down.

377
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:07,703
You're at the window.

378
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:10,426
Smash it.

379
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:21,368
Fantastic.

380
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,305
-Where's the ladder?
-What ladder?

381
00:24:25,472 --> 00:24:27,098
The ladder. Where's it gone?

382
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,134
It's not working. There was
always a dodgy fuse on this.

383
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,191
I'll phone the electrician
in the morning.

384
00:24:32,352 --> 00:24:33,913
In the morning? What about now?

385
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,415
No, he'll be in bed.
You know these country people.

386
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:40,569
Early to bed, early to rise.
He's a nice chap. He's called Norman.

387
00:24:40,736 --> 00:24:43,256
Charming wife, Debbie.
Three delightful kids.

388
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:45,879
Oh, I've just remembered.
He's on vacation.

389
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:48,536
-He's taken the kids to Bermuda.
-What?

390
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:51,387
So I'm stuck up here
for the rest of my life?

391
00:24:51,552 --> 00:24:54,585
Have patience.
Stoicism is what's called for.

392
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:57,054
Works wonders. Oh, wait a minute.

393
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,469
There's an emergency button
on the wall. You see it?

394
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:03,029
That's it. Just press it...

395
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:05,403
...and all will be well.

396
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:09,150
There it is.

397
00:25:15,871 --> 00:25:17,781
Careful. Be careful.

398
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:21,337
That's it.

399
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:25,175
-Careful.
-ls this as far as it will go?

400
00:25:25,343 --> 00:25:26,717
Jump.

401
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:31,260
-Oh, Christ!
-Wonderful.

402
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,966
-Very, very impressed.
-I thought I was gonna die.

403
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,371
-You will.
-So, what the fuck do I do now?

404
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,990
-You open the safe.
-Where is it? How do I open it?

405
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,264
Wait a minute.
You don't know where it is.

406
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:44,602
You've got to find it,
you've got to look for it.

407
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:47,865
Where is it?
Start in the bedroom.

408
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,940
-How are you feeling?
-Okay, all right.

409
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,598
-Excited?
-Quite, yes.

410
00:25:52,766 --> 00:25:55,613
You're a cool customer, I like that.
Okay.

411
00:25:55,774 --> 00:25:57,662
Open the wardrobe.
Open the drawers.

412
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:58,836
Throw things around.

413
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:01,592
You're looking for the safe.
It's up here somewhere.

414
00:26:01,758 --> 00:26:04,824
Play it for real.
Kick the place to death.

415
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:06,418
You're a desperate man.

416
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:09,719
Safes are always kept
behind paintings, aren't they?

417
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:11,130
What are you doing?

418
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:13,683
I'm a desperate man, aren't l?
That's what you said.

419
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:15,763
The man is a barbarian.

420
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:19,763
-Where's the fucking safe?
-Well, open the chest of drawers.

421
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,611
-It's locked.
-Kick it to death.

422
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,106
And this is where I hear you.

423
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:31,546
You hear me?

424
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:36,019
Yes, I'm asleep in the study.
That's where I sleep these days.

425
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:39,091
I can't sleep in the bed
without my wife, you see.

426
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:43,129
I hear you, I come into the bedroom.

427
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:45,147
And I find you.

428
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:46,323
And then?

429
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:48,380
-I attack you.
-How?

430
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,410
Like this. And this.

431
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:58,520
-That hurt.
-So sorry.

432
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:03,419
Then, you get out your knife.

433
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,916
I don't have a knife.

434
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:09,786
I do.

435
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:12,337
-You threaten me with it.
-You're threatening me.

436
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,297
No, I'm playing you.
This is what you do.

437
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,402
You want to know
where the safe is...

438
00:27:16,572 --> 00:27:19,889
...what the combination is,
so you terrorize me with this knife.

439
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,849
-Take it easy.
-You can see I'm ruthless.

440
00:27:22,012 --> 00:27:23,834
I'm unpredictable.
I'm probably a killer.

441
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:27,957
And I'm certainly
very, very dangerous.

442
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:30,873
But you? You're obstinate.

443
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:34,101
-Me or you?
-I'm you, you're me, you get it?

444
00:27:34,556 --> 00:27:38,647
Now, the jewels
are worth a lot of money.

445
00:27:38,812 --> 00:27:40,056
You won't give in...

446
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:45,337
...but I get out my gun.

447
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:48,794
I'm still you, by the way.

448
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:53,850
But then, to make it clear
that I mean business....

449
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:57,332
Bull's-eye.

450
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,150
Bull's-eye.

451
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,929
Finally, you give in.
You're so terrified...

452
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:08,848
...you show me where the safe is.
It is behind that.

453
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:10,001
Magic.

454
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:13,171
And you're so frightened,
you give me the combination.

455
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:17,201
19-11-94. Open it.

456
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,061
Wait a minute. Am I me now?

457
00:28:19,227 --> 00:28:21,561
-Or are you me?
-No, you're now you.

458
00:28:21,722 --> 00:28:22,867
-You're now you.
-Me?

459
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,369
-No, no.
-Or are you still me?

460
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:29,273
You're now you. And I'm now me.

461
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:31,833
Open the safe.

462
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:34,099
19-11-94.

463
00:28:35,738 --> 00:28:37,015
It was our wedding day.

464
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:43,249
The 19th of November, 1994.

465
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,286
Jesus.

466
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,870
What do you think?

467
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:08,207
They're quite beautiful.

468
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:10,450
Put them in your pocket.

469
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:14,707
Eight hundred
thousand pounds, eh?

470
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,657
That's what I said.

471
00:29:22,873 --> 00:29:24,367
Okay.

472
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:30,164
So far, so good.

473
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:32,882
Hey, you'd better give me
the address of that fence.

474
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:35,089
-What fence?
-The fence in Amsterdam.

475
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,533
Oh, that fence.

476
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,702
Listen, you put that gun down.

477
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,207
Why?

478
00:29:42,712 --> 00:29:45,941
It's pointing directly at me.
I'm not very happy about it.

479
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:47,631
Why not?

480
00:29:48,824 --> 00:29:51,858
-Look, is this a game?
-This is the real game.

481
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:57,816
The real game has just begun.

482
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,600
What's the real game?

483
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,767
You and me.

484
00:30:03,288 --> 00:30:06,485
You, defenseless. Me, with a gun.

485
00:30:08,248 --> 00:30:10,255
It's the end of the jewelry story,
you see.

486
00:30:12,024 --> 00:30:13,485
-Oh, is it?
-Yeah.

487
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:15,729
I enjoyed it, though.

488
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:17,133
I'm not enjoying this.

489
00:30:17,304 --> 00:30:18,646
I don't blame you.

490
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:22,262
What's it all about?

491
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:26,384
Oh, come on. Buck your ideas up.

492
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:30,572
You really didn't think I was gonna
let you have my wife and the jewels?

493
00:30:32,983 --> 00:30:34,838
You're joking.

494
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:38,166
You've been leading me
up the garden.

495
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:39,702
Right up.

496
00:30:40,983 --> 00:30:42,871
Stand on the bed.

497
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:56,369
Listen. Wait a minute.

498
00:30:56,535 --> 00:31:00,309
Before you do anything,
there's something I must tell you.

499
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:04,206
-What?
-Maggie respects you.

500
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,684
-Really?
-Yes.

501
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,952
She often says
you're a man of true integrity...

502
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,093
...that you're a really decent guy.

503
00:31:10,262 --> 00:31:12,848
She's right. I'm a really decent guy.

504
00:31:13,014 --> 00:31:14,541
-I believe it.
-She's quite right.

505
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,652
I'm a really decent guy.

506
00:31:16,823 --> 00:31:18,230
I know you are. I know you are.

507
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:20,333
And that's what she often says.

508
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:22,291
You're-- She admires your mind.

509
00:31:22,454 --> 00:31:24,527
-She admires my mind?
-Yes.

510
00:31:24,694 --> 00:31:26,799
-Your mind excites her.
-Sexually?

511
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:29,170
Very. Your mind
excites your wife sexually.

512
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:31,341
-What about my body?
-What about it?

513
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,227
Well, what does she say
about my body?

514
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,932
Do you know,
I don't think she's ever mentioned it.

515
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:40,949
You're a prick.

516
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,317
-Where does my prick come into it?
-I can guess where it comes in.

517
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:49,039
But I wasn't talking
about your prick.

518
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:52,531
-I was calling you a prick.
-Oh, thanks.

519
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:54,450
But you know
what you are now, though?

520
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:55,726
What?

521
00:31:55,893 --> 00:31:58,227
-You're a dead duck.
-Really?

522
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:01,744
This is the way
the story goes to the police.

523
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:04,724
I find you in my house,
you threaten me.

524
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:06,576
You open the safe,
you take the jewels.

525
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:08,083
You put them in your pocket.

526
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:11,344
I manage to grab the gun
while you're looking at the jewels.

527
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:13,778
There's a struggle.
The gun goes off.

528
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:16,301
Suddenly, I realize you're dead.

529
00:32:16,469 --> 00:32:18,291
You're gonna shoot me.

530
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:20,144
-What do you think?
-Why?

531
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:23,756
I planned all this from the word go.

532
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:29,588
I've always longed for
an intimate chat with a hairdresser.

533
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:34,091
Especially a hairdresser
who is fucking my wife.

534
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:35,602
I'm not a hairdresser!

535
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:39,441
My wife is mine! She belongs to me!

536
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:42,866
And I'm her husband!

537
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:47,025
And what you've done is this.

538
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:53,170
You've invited yourself
to attend your own death.

539
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:55,917
Please.

540
00:32:56,084 --> 00:32:57,775
No, don't do it.
Please don't shoot me.

541
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,282
Please don't shoot me, please!
I'll just get in my car and go, okay?

542
00:33:02,452 --> 00:33:04,394
That's all.
You'll never see me again.

543
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:05,899
You're crazy.

544
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,369
No, you're not crazy.
You just got things wrong.

545
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,474
I don't want your wife. I hate women.

546
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:12,553
You hear me?
I hate women. I hate your wife!

547
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,342
You've absolutely
no reason to be jealous.

548
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:19,400
Women are not my scene.
I'd rather do it with a dog or a goat.

549
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:22,702
Or a boy I knew at school.
His name was Dooley.

550
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,169
I called him Dolores.
I hate women!

551
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:28,530
Honest. God's honor.

552
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:30,153
Do you believe in God?

553
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:05,102
Just shut up.

554
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:10,574
I'm asking the questions, not you.

555
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:14,573
-How long have you known him?
-I don't know him. I've never met him.

556
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:20,428
What are you? A joker?

557
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:06,115
Yes?

558
00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:09,609
Andrew Wyke?

559
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:11,268
Yes.

560
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,609
Detective Inspector Black.

561
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:16,425
New Scotland Yard. Eddie Black.

562
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:19,981
I'd like a word with you.

563
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:21,868
A word?

564
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:23,589
That's right.

565
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:25,959
What about?

566
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:30,279
Can I come in?

567
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:33,865
Yes. Yes, of course.

568
00:37:35,757 --> 00:37:36,740
Like a drink?

569
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:38,819
Got any beer?

570
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,730
Beer? Yes.

571
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:43,210
You're the writer.

572
00:37:44,077 --> 00:37:46,182
You write crime books.

573
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:48,323
That's right.

574
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:50,632
I've read a couple.

575
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:52,972
Right on the button.

576
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:55,369
Oh, that's a great compliment.

577
00:37:56,781 --> 00:37:59,334
How do you know so much about it?

578
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:00,711
What?

579
00:38:00,877 --> 00:38:02,371
Villainy.

580
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:04,745
Crime. Horror.

581
00:38:06,412 --> 00:38:08,235
Imagination.

582
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,140
Imagination.

583
00:38:11,308 --> 00:38:12,552
Clever.

584
00:38:12,716 --> 00:38:14,571
I do my best.

585
00:38:15,564 --> 00:38:17,637
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

586
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:25,931
I see you got
a broken window up there.

587
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,732
Tropical storm the other night.

588
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,169
Bit of a hurricane, terrifying.

589
00:38:32,332 --> 00:38:35,049
A great branch broke off a big tree...

590
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,633
...and flew through the air
through the skylight...

591
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:40,011
...as you can see.

592
00:38:40,172 --> 00:38:41,416
Act of God.

593
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,205
Had it in for you, did he?

594
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,193
-Who?
-God.

595
00:38:45,355 --> 00:38:47,460
Oh, yes, he's always been
a vicious bastard.

596
00:38:47,627 --> 00:38:49,034
You know what God's trouble is?

597
00:38:49,195 --> 00:38:51,050
-What?
-He has no father.

598
00:38:51,211 --> 00:38:54,506
He has no family roots.
He's rootless.

599
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:58,213
Nowhere to hang his hat,
poor bugger. I pity him.

600
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:01,379
That's a very interesting
philosophical speculation.

601
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,198
Wait a minute.
Aren't you a well-known detective?

602
00:39:04,363 --> 00:39:06,218
No.

603
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:10,273
Not me, mate.
You're thinking of another bloke.

604
00:39:10,923 --> 00:39:13,989
Haven't I seen your picture
in the newspaper?

605
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:17,832
Do you want to know
my opinion of the newspapers?

606
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:19,489
What?

607
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:24,328
Journalists are a bunch
of prick-teasing cocksuckers.

608
00:39:24,747 --> 00:39:25,892
No.

609
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:27,237
That's right.

610
00:39:27,402 --> 00:39:30,402
I'm sorry, but isn't that
a contradiction in terms?

611
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,228
Is it?

612
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:35,653
So you're not well-known?

613
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:37,825
No, I'm a common-or-garden copper.

614
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:41,507
I just catch sex criminals, perverts...

615
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:43,049
...homicidal maniacs.

616
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,406
And what do you do with them
when you catch them?

617
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,156
I generally cut their balls off.

618
00:39:50,698 --> 00:39:52,421
I see.

619
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:03,206
So how can I help you?

620
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:05,736
Yes, I think you can help me.
I think you can.

621
00:40:05,897 --> 00:40:07,207
How?

622
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,995
I'm looking into a disappearance.

623
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:10,143
Disappearance?

624
00:40:10,314 --> 00:40:13,445
Man called Tindle. Milo Tindle.

625
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:17,057
Sorry, I didn't get the name.
What was it?

626
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:18,752
Tindle.

627
00:40:19,657 --> 00:40:22,079
Tindle. Tindle....

628
00:40:23,306 --> 00:40:24,832
What about him?

629
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:26,343
Do you know him?

630
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:28,839
Know him? Absolutely not.

631
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:30,725
-You mean you've never met him?
-Never.

632
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:32,230
Never even heard of him.

633
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:33,954
-That's funny.
-Why?

634
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,804
Well, he was staying
at the Red Lion in the village...

635
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:38,725
...where he mentioned
to the landlord...

636
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:40,863
...he was coming to see you
three nights ago.

637
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:42,178
He hasn't been seen since.

638
00:40:42,345 --> 00:40:44,996
His bag is still in his room,
shaving kit, all that.

639
00:40:45,161 --> 00:40:46,240
He was coming to see me?

640
00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:48,034
That's right.

641
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:49,608
He mentioned it to the landlord?

642
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:52,005
Why would he mention such a thing
to the landlord?

643
00:40:52,168 --> 00:40:55,202
Well, you're a famous writer
and you're well known in the district.

644
00:40:55,368 --> 00:40:56,994
So how can you help me on this?

645
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,461
No one came to see me.
I've no idea who this man is.

646
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:03,007
And I know no one called Tindle.

647
00:41:03,176 --> 00:41:04,964
You don't, eh?

648
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,267
What are you? A joker?

649
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:16,861
What do you mean?

650
00:41:17,032 --> 00:41:19,585
I mean you're pretty quick
on your feet.

651
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:22,653
You should have been
a ballet dancer.

652
00:41:22,824 --> 00:41:25,955
I can just see you doing pirouettes.

653
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:29,885
-Ever worn a pair of tights?
-Not me.

654
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:34,467
They'd suit you.

655
00:41:36,008 --> 00:41:37,185
Nice house.

656
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:38,758
Thanks.

657
00:41:39,655 --> 00:41:42,022
-Design it yourself?
-It's 18th-century.

658
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:45,117
No, no, I meant this. The inside.

659
00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:46,269
That was my wife.

660
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:48,741
Oh, your wife.
Is she here, by the way?

661
00:41:48,903 --> 00:41:49,917
No.

662
00:41:50,087 --> 00:41:51,581
Popped up to London?

663
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:53,213
She's not here.

664
00:41:53,383 --> 00:41:56,001
She's an interior decorator, then?

665
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:57,629
Something like that.

666
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:02,308
It's a great gift, isn't it?

667
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:05,695
You're a lucky man.

668
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:09,093
You got an ashtray?

669
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:17,152
I'm ready for another beer.

670
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:25,247
A man was passing your house
three nights ago.

671
00:42:25,414 --> 00:42:27,586
He said he heard shots.

672
00:42:27,751 --> 00:42:29,277
Passed my house?

673
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,643
How could he do that?
It's private property.

674
00:42:32,806 --> 00:42:35,140
He were taking a shortcut.

675
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,611
I think he's a poacher.

676
00:42:36,774 --> 00:42:39,141
Anyway, says he heard shots.

677
00:42:39,302 --> 00:42:41,058
What kind of shots?

678
00:42:41,222 --> 00:42:42,204
Gunshots.

679
00:42:42,374 --> 00:42:44,064
-Fantasy.
-Really?

680
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,269
Bullshit. Codswallop.

681
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,121
Who is this man?
Are you sure he exists?

682
00:42:49,285 --> 00:42:51,489
Oh, he exists, all right.

683
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:52,766
By the way, cheers.

684
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:54,460
Cheers.

685
00:42:58,693 --> 00:43:01,148
I do want to ask you
one more question.

686
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:11,331
Ask.

687
00:43:11,493 --> 00:43:14,144
You do know your wife's
living in London with another man?

688
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,148
That is my business.

689
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:20,960
My private life is my business.

690
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,619
Do you know the name of this man?

691
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:25,155
Why should I answer
these questions?

692
00:43:26,949 --> 00:43:29,818
You don't have to,
but you'd be better off if you did.

693
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,601
I don't know the man's name.

694
00:43:37,028 --> 00:43:38,784
I never asked.

695
00:43:40,612 --> 00:43:44,540
So you do admit that your wife's
living in London with another man?

696
00:43:46,148 --> 00:43:48,832
Yes. Yes.

697
00:43:48,996 --> 00:43:50,621
So what?

698
00:43:52,452 --> 00:43:56,675
Well, I can tell you the man's name.

699
00:44:02,148 --> 00:44:04,090
It's Tindle.

700
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:06,051
Milo Tindle.

701
00:44:10,852 --> 00:44:13,186
-ls it?
-Yeah.

702
00:44:14,308 --> 00:44:16,512
The bloke who's disappeared.

703
00:44:16,676 --> 00:44:19,578
The bloke who said
he was coming to see you.

704
00:44:19,748 --> 00:44:22,911
We found this note in his room.

705
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:24,831
At the pub.

706
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:27,996
"l look forward to meeting you.

707
00:44:28,163 --> 00:44:31,196
Come to the house Friday, 6:30.

708
00:44:31,395 --> 00:44:32,988
Wyke."

709
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:35,808
Is this your handwriting?

710
00:44:36,995 --> 00:44:40,573
-It is.
-Do you remember writing this note?

711
00:44:41,123 --> 00:44:42,432
How could I forget?

712
00:44:42,595 --> 00:44:44,570
You forgot earlier.

713
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:47,324
You said you didn't know him.

714
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:50,044
You said you'd never met him.

715
00:45:08,354 --> 00:45:09,783
I was lying.

716
00:45:15,426 --> 00:45:17,728
Lying to the police.

717
00:45:18,722 --> 00:45:20,894
That will get you nowhere.

718
00:45:24,706 --> 00:45:26,811
I don't understand you,
mate, honest.

719
00:45:26,978 --> 00:45:29,792
You're a clever man.
You write clever books.

720
00:45:29,953 --> 00:45:32,255
But you've made a balls-up
of this one, haven't you?

721
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:33,883
Have l?

722
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:37,246
Tindle came to see you
three nights ago.

723
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,744
-I knew him as Tindolini.
-Oh, I see.

724
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:41,628
-He had an Italian father.
-Get away.

725
00:45:41,793 --> 00:45:44,379
A traditional
Italian hairdressing family.

726
00:45:44,546 --> 00:45:47,841
-ls he a hairdresser himself?
-I think he is.

727
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:50,554
He didn't come all the way here
to do your hair, did he?

728
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:52,892
Not at all, not at all.

729
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:57,662
So, what did you two do
when you got together?

730
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:01,728
We played a game.

731
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,797
-A game?
-A game with a knife and a gun.

732
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,422
-A lethal game?
-No.

733
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,441
Just a bit of fun, that's all.

734
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:10,943
Okay, a bit of fun.

735
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:12,861
So he came to see you.

736
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:16,341
You played a game
with a knife and a gun.

737
00:46:16,513 --> 00:46:19,480
Three shots were fired,
then he disappeared.

738
00:46:19,649 --> 00:46:20,794
So where is he?

739
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:23,895
-Probably cuddling my wife.
-That's the one thing he's not doing.

740
00:46:24,288 --> 00:46:25,717
-How do you know?
-I've seen her.

741
00:46:25,888 --> 00:46:27,098
He was nowhere in sight.

742
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,419
No. She's an anxious woman.

743
00:46:32,064 --> 00:46:34,366
She knew he was coming
to see you, you see.

744
00:46:34,528 --> 00:46:37,910
In fact, she insisted
that he come to see you...

745
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,967
...as I know you know.

746
00:46:42,688 --> 00:46:45,176
She thinks you may have killed him.

747
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:48,599
She thinks you're round the bend.

748
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,578
She thinks
you're a very dangerous man.

749
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:53,021
Me? She's joking.

750
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,437
So tell me, between ourselves...

751
00:46:57,919 --> 00:46:59,643
...did you kill him?

752
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:04,222
I'll tell you exactly what I did.

753
00:47:04,383 --> 00:47:06,522
I pretended to kill him.

754
00:47:06,688 --> 00:47:10,582
I shot him with a blank.
I frightened the shit out of him.

755
00:47:11,136 --> 00:47:14,169
Your man was right.
Your spy, whoever he was.

756
00:47:14,335 --> 00:47:15,796
There were three shots.

757
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,934
The first two were real.
The third one was blank.

758
00:47:20,095 --> 00:47:23,542
He was terrified.
When I shot him, he fainted.

759
00:47:23,711 --> 00:47:26,231
When he came round
I gave him a drink, pat on the bum...

760
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:30,938
...he left the house, his tail, if you
want to call it that, between his legs.

761
00:47:31,103 --> 00:47:32,630
And I haven't seen him since.

762
00:47:32,799 --> 00:47:35,319
You gave him a pat on the bum?

763
00:47:35,487 --> 00:47:36,665
Metaphorically.

764
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:39,732
You gave him
a metaphorical pat on the bum?

765
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:41,560
-Sure.
-How did he take it?

766
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:43,515
-What?
-The pat.

767
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:48,318
He was fine. He told me that
it was game, set and match to me.

768
00:47:49,118 --> 00:47:51,988
So this guy had a sense of humor,
is that what you're saying?

769
00:47:52,158 --> 00:47:54,875
Oh, yes. He left the house
with a twinkle in his eye.

770
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,072
So tell me,
what was the point of all this?

771
00:47:58,238 --> 00:47:59,252
Humiliation.

772
00:47:59,422 --> 00:48:01,080
It's nice to see your wife's lover...

773
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:03,996
...a shivering, frightened,
fucking wreck in front of you.

774
00:48:04,158 --> 00:48:05,914
As a matter of fact, I liked him.

775
00:48:06,366 --> 00:48:07,708
I thought he was attractive.

776
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,779
I thought we could have
become good friends.

777
00:48:10,269 --> 00:48:14,906
The shortest way to a man's heart,
as I'm sure you know, is humiliation.

778
00:48:15,069 --> 00:48:17,436
It binds you together.

779
00:48:19,806 --> 00:48:22,489
You found him attractive?

780
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:26,330
I put myself in my wife's shoes,
in a manner of speaking.

781
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:30,071
I was trying to find out
what attracted her to him.

782
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:33,849
-And did you?
-Oh, yes.

783
00:48:34,013 --> 00:48:36,730
He was really terribly sweet.

784
00:48:36,893 --> 00:48:40,209
-I could see why she fancied him.
-I could see why he fancies her.

785
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:43,669
-Really?
-Found her very tasty myself.

786
00:48:44,317 --> 00:48:46,488
-ls that so?
-Oh, yes.

787
00:48:46,653 --> 00:48:48,987
Sumptuous. Ready for action.

788
00:48:50,877 --> 00:48:53,561
I mean,
I'm an experienced detective.

789
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:56,626
So guess what I detected.

790
00:48:56,796 --> 00:48:57,974
What?

791
00:48:58,141 --> 00:49:01,370
That she's in love
with her own body.

792
00:49:01,533 --> 00:49:04,118
Makes her dizzy with excitement.

793
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:09,563
You detected all this
in five minutes?

794
00:49:09,725 --> 00:49:12,343
Well, 35. Perhaps even 45.

795
00:49:12,508 --> 00:49:16,217
Well, let's call it 55
or even a little bit longer.

796
00:49:16,668 --> 00:49:17,650
You stayed for tea?

797
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,707
And cakes.

798
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:22,068
Yeah.

799
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:28,212
Yeah.

800
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,940
Must be funny for you to know...

801
00:49:30,108 --> 00:49:33,686
...your own wife's getting a going-over
from another man on a regular basis.

802
00:49:33,852 --> 00:49:35,226
Going-over? I don't follow.

803
00:49:35,388 --> 00:49:36,665
You don't?

804
00:49:36,828 --> 00:49:38,322
Not a phrase I'm familiar with.

805
00:49:38,491 --> 00:49:41,720
-Means being fucked.
-You mean like in sexual intercourse?

806
00:49:41,884 --> 00:49:45,113
Yes, the old one-two.
In like a lion, out like a lamb.

807
00:49:45,276 --> 00:49:47,796
I must say, you have
a great gift for language.

808
00:49:47,964 --> 00:49:49,174
Did you learn it at school?

809
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,063
The hard school. Family life.

810
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,878
-But you keep cheerful.
-You've got it, I keep cheerful.

811
00:49:54,043 --> 00:49:56,432
I've got an optimistic nature.

812
00:49:56,603 --> 00:49:59,025
You got to when you're a policeman.
Otherwise, you'd go mad.

813
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:02,456
No, I'll tell you
what keeps me going.

814
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:07,539
The chase. The thrill of the hunt
and the sudden shafts of bright light.

815
00:50:08,186 --> 00:50:12,921
For instance,
when I was talking to your wife....

816
00:50:13,755 --> 00:50:16,089
Very attractive woman.

817
00:50:17,627 --> 00:50:19,732
Wonderful legs.

818
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:25,812
She was crossing them at the time,
I remember.

819
00:50:25,978 --> 00:50:31,313
She suddenly said
you had a murderous nature.

820
00:50:33,435 --> 00:50:35,856
Now, that really
made my nose twitch.

821
00:50:36,026 --> 00:50:37,553
Itch?

822
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:41,684
Twitch, mate.

823
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:43,797
Twitch.

824
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:47,127
So I'm looking at you
and I'm wondering...

825
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:49,462
...what have you done
with the body?

826
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,468
Where's the body?

827
00:50:53,209 --> 00:50:55,151
Come on, I need to know.

828
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,912
Where's the body?
What have you done with the body?

829
00:50:58,074 --> 00:50:59,056
There's no body.

830
00:50:59,225 --> 00:51:01,135
Don't fuck about!

831
00:51:01,306 --> 00:51:03,061
Don't bullshit me.
I won't stand for it.

832
00:51:03,225 --> 00:51:05,265
Where is it?
In the house or did you shift it?

833
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:07,343
There is no body!

834
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:18,576
Here, look at this.
You got holes in your walls.

835
00:51:21,401 --> 00:51:24,215
They're bullet holes.
Live bullet holes.

836
00:51:24,378 --> 00:51:26,417
I fired two live bullets
to set up the trick...

837
00:51:26,585 --> 00:51:28,112
...and one blank to complete it.

838
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:30,670
It was a game, I told you.
I played it to the hilt.

839
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:33,459
It's not worth playing
unless you play it to the hilt.

840
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:35,729
-The third shot was a blank?
-That's right.

841
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:36,879
-What's that?
-What?

842
00:51:37,049 --> 00:51:39,024
Blood. Dried blood!

843
00:51:39,192 --> 00:51:41,364
Some of it's not even dried.
It's still damp.

844
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:43,317
-That's impossible.
-That's blood, chum.

845
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,368
-Whose blood is it?
-It's impossible.

846
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:46,958
It was a game. It was a blank.

847
00:51:47,128 --> 00:51:49,495
No, it was a game
with real bullets and real blood.

848
00:51:49,656 --> 00:51:50,900
This is a carve-up.

849
00:51:51,064 --> 00:51:54,708
Let's see what else
is new around here.

850
00:51:55,256 --> 00:51:57,012
Hello, what's this?

851
00:51:57,817 --> 00:52:01,646
We've got a shirt, jacket and trousers
in the back of your cupboard.

852
00:52:01,817 --> 00:52:04,500
Very negligent of you, mate,
unless they're not yours.

853
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:08,461
No, I don't think they're yours.
I think they belong to Tindle.

854
00:52:08,632 --> 00:52:11,283
You say he left the house
after you shot him.

855
00:52:11,448 --> 00:52:13,270
-Yes.
-Naked?

856
00:52:13,432 --> 00:52:14,839
I don't know how those got there.

857
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,302
So you made him strip
before you shot him?

858
00:52:17,464 --> 00:52:19,373
Part of the humiliation, was it?

859
00:52:19,544 --> 00:52:21,006
No. The thing is this.

860
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:24,077
It might have started as a game,
but it got out of hand.

861
00:52:24,248 --> 00:52:26,485
The third shot was live!

862
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:29,964
It killed him. So where's the body?

863
00:52:30,135 --> 00:52:32,143
I didn't kill him! He's alive!

864
00:52:32,312 --> 00:52:34,384
Bollocks. You're a joker, all right.

865
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:36,013
A real joker.

866
00:52:36,183 --> 00:52:37,906
Come on, we're off to the station.

867
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,559
-There's something very wrong here.
-Hey, dead right.

868
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:43,891
I'll tell you what you are.
You're fucked.

869
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:45,325
Jesus Christ.

870
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,666
Don't struggle, chum.
I'll have you for breakfast.

871
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,108
There's something wrong here.

872
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:53,068
You're up shit creek, Wyke.
You're up shit creek without a paddle.

873
00:52:56,279 --> 00:52:59,628
Look at you. All aquiver.

874
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:02,479
Who's the dead duck?

875
00:53:06,038 --> 00:53:07,413
Jesus Christ.

876
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:14,450
You're the dead duck.

877
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:22,611
I just sucked you in
and blew you out in little bubbles.

878
00:53:22,774 --> 00:53:24,181
-It's you.
-It's me, all right.

879
00:53:24,342 --> 00:53:26,644
You bastard. You stinking bastard.

880
00:53:26,806 --> 00:53:28,115
Just a little game, Andrew.

881
00:53:28,278 --> 00:53:30,165
-Just a little game.
-You shit.

882
00:53:30,326 --> 00:53:32,944
-I thought it might amuse you.
-You're a total shit.

883
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,387
I know I am.

884
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:38,063
-But you're also a genius.
-I know that too.

885
00:53:40,438 --> 00:53:42,642
When did you do this?
The clothes in the wardrobe?

886
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:45,326
-The blood?
-The blood belongs to a pig's liver.

887
00:53:45,494 --> 00:53:47,567
But when did you do it?
How did you do it?

888
00:53:47,733 --> 00:53:50,581
I did it last night. I used that ladder.
I heard you snoring.

889
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:53,709
Does Maggie know about this?
Your detective, was it her idea?

890
00:53:53,878 --> 00:53:56,212
-How much does she know?
-She knows nothing about it.

891
00:53:56,373 --> 00:53:59,373
Entirely my own idea.

892
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:02,410
This is a game between us, old boy.

893
00:54:02,581 --> 00:54:05,330
Between you and me.

894
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:07,860
Don't forget, I'm half Italian.

895
00:54:08,021 --> 00:54:09,614
We go in for revenge.

896
00:54:22,037 --> 00:54:26,259
After all, you frightened
the life out of me deliberately.

897
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,170
You fired two live bullets
into the wall...

898
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:32,911
...and then you pointed
the gun at me.

899
00:54:33,077 --> 00:54:35,182
And then you fired.

900
00:54:38,868 --> 00:54:40,429
I don't like guns.

901
00:54:41,717 --> 00:54:43,342
They kill you.

902
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:48,077
Okay.

903
00:54:48,245 --> 00:54:50,666
So, what does this make the score?

904
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:53,610
You've had your revenge.

905
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:57,806
So, what do you reckon?

906
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,147
One set all?

907
00:55:00,627 --> 00:55:02,896
No, no, you're way ahead.

908
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:07,824
I only teased you with my inspector,
gave you a few goose pimples.

909
00:55:08,756 --> 00:55:10,283
But you frightened me to death.

910
00:55:12,436 --> 00:55:14,857
Did you really think
I was going to kill you?

911
00:55:15,027 --> 00:55:18,507
You fainted, you see.
It was a blank.

912
00:55:19,604 --> 00:55:22,603
I may be three games up
in the second set.

913
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:23,753
If I had killed you...

914
00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:27,119
...I'd have to bury the body
in the garden or somewhere.

915
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:28,265
Too exhausting.

916
00:55:28,435 --> 00:55:29,809
But you won the first, 6-love.

917
00:55:34,355 --> 00:55:36,777
So we're a long way
from one set all.

918
00:55:43,155 --> 00:55:46,057
By the way, I spoke to Maggie.

919
00:55:46,227 --> 00:55:49,042
I told her all about you.

920
00:55:49,203 --> 00:55:50,610
She loved it.

921
00:55:51,699 --> 00:55:52,844
Loved what?

922
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:55,981
That I frightened the life out of you.

923
00:55:56,147 --> 00:55:57,423
That you pissed your pants.

924
00:55:59,346 --> 00:56:01,735
And that you actually fainted.

925
00:56:01,907 --> 00:56:04,754
She said to me,
"You mean he actually fainted?"

926
00:56:04,914 --> 00:56:07,565
I said, "Dead out,
he was scared shitless.

927
00:56:08,946 --> 00:56:10,407
Went out like a light."

928
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:15,819
She laughed so much,
I thought she was gonna burst.

929
00:56:20,082 --> 00:56:23,857
Oh, incidentally,
she's coming back to me.

930
00:56:24,497 --> 00:56:25,774
Oh, is she?

931
00:56:25,938 --> 00:56:27,596
Yes, that's right.

932
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:29,453
You know what she said about you?

933
00:56:29,618 --> 00:56:30,632
What?

934
00:56:30,802 --> 00:56:32,046
She said:

935
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:35,471
"Faint heart never won fair lady."

936
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:38,954
Is that a fact?

937
00:56:39,121 --> 00:56:40,365
Yeah.

938
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:46,156
Listen, I want to
show you something.

939
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:49,773
Go into your study and sit down.

940
00:56:51,889 --> 00:56:53,383
Go into my study?

941
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:56,938
And sit down.

942
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:03,152
-What are you doing?
-It's late at night.

943
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:05,549
You're reading a book under a lamp.
Read something.

944
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,168
-What's going on?
-Read a book.

945
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:10,639
It's late at night.
You're reading a book.

946
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:12,808
You hear something. You look up.

947
00:57:12,977 --> 00:57:14,700
It's me jumping off the ladder.

948
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:16,425
You see me with this gun.

949
00:57:16,592 --> 00:57:20,454
You're caught like a rat in a trap.
You stare at the gun, you're paralyzed.

950
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:21,901
I've come for the jewels.

951
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,722
-Where is the safe?
-What jewels?

952
00:57:23,888 --> 00:57:25,197
The jewels. Where's the safe?

953
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,735
-You know where it is.
-I don't.

954
00:57:26,896 --> 00:57:28,936
-You don't?
-Don't fuck me about, I mean it.

955
00:57:29,104 --> 00:57:30,566
Get up.

956
00:57:31,344 --> 00:57:33,645
You think this gun isn't real?

957
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:38,030
Where is it?

958
00:57:38,768 --> 00:57:41,583
-Upstairs.
-Well, let's go upstairs.

959
00:57:42,255 --> 00:57:47,340
Get up these stairs
or I'll ram this gun right up your ass.

960
00:57:47,536 --> 00:57:50,700
-The safe is behind the fish tank.
-How am I gonna get to it?

961
00:57:50,864 --> 00:57:53,384
Well, you press the button
and the button moves the tank.

962
00:57:53,552 --> 00:57:55,723
Then press it.

963
00:57:55,888 --> 00:57:58,343
It's not working. It's out of ord--

964
00:57:59,695 --> 00:58:01,124
Are you a maniac? You're crazy.

965
00:58:01,296 --> 00:58:03,881
-Open it.
-I changed the combination yesterday.

966
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:06,436
-What is it?
-I forgot. I can't remember.

967
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,582
-Remember.
-It's the truth. I can't remember.

968
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:09,766
Remember!

969
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:14,573
What are you doing?
What are you gonna do?

970
00:58:14,735 --> 00:58:18,729
I've broken into your house because
I know you have jewels in a safe.

971
00:58:19,535 --> 00:58:22,121
I have inside information.
I want them.

972
00:58:22,287 --> 00:58:24,588
Remember the combination
and open it.

973
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,380
It was a blank.

974
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:36,356
The next one's real.

975
00:58:54,126 --> 00:58:55,882
There's a good boy.

976
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,564
So, what are you writing
at the moment?

977
00:59:20,302 --> 00:59:21,927
What am I writing?

978
00:59:22,382 --> 00:59:24,356
Yes, I'm very interested in literature.

979
00:59:28,654 --> 00:59:31,207
Do you mind if I have a drink?

980
00:59:31,373 --> 00:59:34,854
Sure. It's your house.

981
00:59:35,213 --> 00:59:39,239
I'm always interested
in the people I rob.

982
00:59:39,437 --> 00:59:43,266
Like I'm always interested
in the husbands of the wives I fuck.

983
00:59:44,813 --> 00:59:46,471
Are you really?

984
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:48,774
Well, well.

985
00:59:49,901 --> 00:59:51,427
Cheers.

986
00:59:57,709 --> 01:00:02,051
So, what are you writing?

987
01:00:06,605 --> 01:00:10,118
It's the story of a pathological killer.

988
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:13,252
-I call it The Smiling Man.
-Does he come to a bad end?

989
01:00:13,421 --> 01:00:16,203
He dies during the act of love.
Like countless others.

990
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:17,542
Countless others, eh?

991
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:20,043
I can see you've researched
the subject thoroughly.

992
01:00:21,068 --> 01:00:24,329
-What subject?
-Death in orgasm.

993
01:00:24,492 --> 01:00:28,136
Isn't that a beautiful notion?
To die in the arms of your beloved.

994
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,813
Can you imagine
anything more poignant?

995
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,052
-I can't, no.
-No.

996
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:38,410
-You're a married man, aren't you?
-Yeah, been married 13 years.

997
01:00:38,572 --> 01:00:39,782
It was love at first sight.

998
01:00:39,948 --> 01:00:41,257
-Very moving.
-Yeah.

999
01:00:41,419 --> 01:00:43,524
And we're still in love.
Like two peas in a pod.

1000
01:00:43,691 --> 01:00:46,179
Someone told me
your wife has a lover.

1001
01:00:46,348 --> 01:00:48,290
-She has, yeah.
-Do you know him?

1002
01:00:48,459 --> 01:00:51,209
No, I've never met him.
He's some sort of Italian.

1003
01:00:51,371 --> 01:00:53,607
Called Tandoori or something.

1004
01:00:53,771 --> 01:00:55,713
One of the Bombay Tandooris?

1005
01:00:55,883 --> 01:00:57,792
You've got it, yeah.

1006
01:00:57,963 --> 01:01:00,713
You know something? I've never met
an artistic burglar before.

1007
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,882
That's fantastic.

1008
01:01:04,075 --> 01:01:05,897
-What's your background?
-Me?

1009
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:08,393
-You.
-Irish. Connemara.

1010
01:01:08,555 --> 01:01:10,660
Spanish descent.
By way of Uganda.

1011
01:01:10,826 --> 01:01:12,452
My grandparents were slaves.

1012
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:15,521
My mother was a dark-eyed,
dusky beauty.

1013
01:01:15,691 --> 01:01:19,204
-Were you breastfed?
-Oh, sure, like a baby.

1014
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:26,179
Shall I tell you what I want you to do
with these jewels?

1015
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,512
What?

1016
01:01:40,394 --> 01:01:45,445
You look so charming.

1017
01:01:51,658 --> 01:01:53,119
How do you want it?

1018
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:54,817
Like this?

1019
01:01:54,985 --> 01:01:57,254
Or shorter?

1020
01:01:58,282 --> 01:02:02,373
How about this?
Or even shorter like a halter?

1021
01:02:02,538 --> 01:02:05,887
-You're hurting me.
-Oh, am I hurting you?

1022
01:02:06,057 --> 01:02:09,603
-Yes. Don't hurt me.
-Are you sensitive to pain?

1023
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,842
Very. Very.

1024
01:02:12,009 --> 01:02:14,464
I wouldn't want to hurt you,
sweetheart.

1025
01:02:14,634 --> 01:02:17,023
You're too much fun.

1026
01:02:17,193 --> 01:02:20,870
-Am I really?
-Oh, yes. You're wicked.

1027
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:23,848
I like that. Yeah.

1028
01:02:24,969 --> 01:02:26,944
Do you know something?

1029
01:02:28,073 --> 01:02:31,073
I don't think
these earrings really suit me.

1030
01:02:32,937 --> 01:02:35,936
You're right. Take them off.

1031
01:02:39,752 --> 01:02:41,411
I don't....

1032
01:02:41,576 --> 01:02:46,049
I don't think this bracelet
is really my style either.

1033
01:02:47,784 --> 01:02:50,173
But the necklace is nice.

1034
01:02:51,496 --> 01:02:52,576
I'm not totally sure.

1035
01:02:52,744 --> 01:02:57,446
Listen, you can play with these jewels
until the cows come home.

1036
01:02:57,608 --> 01:03:01,918
They're yours.
Do what you like with them.

1037
01:03:04,392 --> 01:03:07,392
But I thought you'd just stolen them.

1038
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,927
No, no! It was a game!

1039
01:03:10,088 --> 01:03:14,910
It was just a game!
I thought it might amuse you.

1040
01:03:31,368 --> 01:03:32,797
Well....

1041
01:03:34,312 --> 01:03:37,825
Aren't you the wicked one?

1042
01:03:44,935 --> 01:03:46,179
You remember what I said?

1043
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:51,012
You won the first set, 6-love.
I was 3-love up in the second.

1044
01:03:51,175 --> 01:03:55,430
Well, now it's one set all.

1045
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:08,541
But who's going to win the third set?

1046
01:04:10,662 --> 01:04:12,670
Remains to be seen.

1047
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:32,132
You like games, don't you?

1048
01:04:33,382 --> 01:04:35,748
Some. Not all.

1049
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:38,331
But you like being in charge...

1050
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:40,193
...of the game?

1051
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,747
Oh, yes. Sure.

1052
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:48,284
I like a man who wants
to be in charge of things.

1053
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:51,038
-Do you?
-Yes, I do.

1054
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:54,463
Listen, you've met my wife, I think.

1055
01:04:55,717 --> 01:04:59,427
I have met her. Yes.

1056
01:04:59,621 --> 01:05:02,338
-Did she say if she had a husband?
-Yes.

1057
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:05,021
Yeah, she said she had a husband.

1058
01:05:05,797 --> 01:05:08,350
How did she describe him?

1059
01:05:10,245 --> 01:05:12,580
Remote. Cold.

1060
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:15,523
Malevolent. Spiteful.

1061
01:05:15,973 --> 01:05:18,493
Arrogant. Ruthless.

1062
01:05:18,661 --> 01:05:20,417
Jealous. Paranoid.

1063
01:05:20,581 --> 01:05:24,290
Criminal tendencies.
Mentally unsound.

1064
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:25,859
That's me, all right.

1065
01:05:30,053 --> 01:05:32,387
You know something?
I like your mind.

1066
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,100
-Do you really?
-It excites me.

1067
01:05:35,492 --> 01:05:37,281
I like the way you go about things.

1068
01:05:39,012 --> 01:05:42,208
You mean you like my style?

1069
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:44,477
Oh, I like your style.

1070
01:05:44,644 --> 01:05:47,066
I like it very much.

1071
01:05:48,132 --> 01:05:51,678
Look, I want to
make you a proposition.

1072
01:05:52,612 --> 01:05:54,041
What?

1073
01:05:56,292 --> 01:05:58,299
I want to show you something.

1074
01:06:02,372 --> 01:06:06,016
-Can't you put that gun down now?
-No.

1075
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:09,180
God, you're so strong, so ruthless,
aren't you?

1076
01:06:09,348 --> 01:06:10,330
Yes.

1077
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:13,150
Have you any idea
what my proposition is going to be?

1078
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:15,585
-No.
-Are you excited?

1079
01:06:15,747 --> 01:06:16,827
I'd say intrigued.

1080
01:06:16,996 --> 01:06:19,614
I think you're going to be excited
very much.

1081
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:23,041
This is the guest suite.

1082
01:06:24,611 --> 01:06:27,873
Isn't it nice? Look at the view.

1083
01:06:28,867 --> 01:06:30,907
There's a private bathroom.
A small fridge.

1084
01:06:31,075 --> 01:06:36,061
A bottle of Chilean Chardonnay
is chilling in there at this very moment.

1085
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:40,095
This suite is uninhabited.

1086
01:06:41,507 --> 01:06:43,034
It has no occupant.

1087
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:50,237
How would you like it?

1088
01:06:53,538 --> 01:06:54,782
Me?

1089
01:06:56,963 --> 01:06:58,337
Yes, yes.

1090
01:06:58,498 --> 01:07:03,102
I think I've come to the conclusion
that you're my kind of person.

1091
01:07:05,986 --> 01:07:07,448
Am l, now?

1092
01:07:08,002 --> 01:07:10,457
Well, I told you.
I liked your mind. It excited me.

1093
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:14,335
I need intellectual excitement.

1094
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:16,702
Intellectual stimulation.

1095
01:07:18,626 --> 01:07:20,448
Well, they don't grow on trees.

1096
01:07:21,186 --> 01:07:23,357
I'm a rich man.

1097
01:07:23,522 --> 01:07:25,496
What do you want to do?

1098
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:28,187
I can subsidize anything you want.

1099
01:07:29,186 --> 01:07:31,771
You want to open a bookshop
in the village?

1100
01:07:32,545 --> 01:07:36,026
An art gallery?
Or, of course, a little theater.

1101
01:07:36,449 --> 01:07:37,562
You're a wonderful actor.

1102
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:41,526
You could choose all the plays
and play all the leading parts.

1103
01:07:42,977 --> 01:07:47,101
But this would be your home.

1104
01:07:51,553 --> 01:07:54,106
And this would be your bedroom.

1105
01:07:58,945 --> 01:08:02,044
You're asking me to live here?

1106
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:07,009
Yes, I'm asking you to stay with me.

1107
01:08:07,681 --> 01:08:11,805
Oh, we would also travel.
I mean, Jamaica, Swiss Alps.

1108
01:08:11,969 --> 01:08:13,856
I bet you're a wonderful skier,
aren't you?

1109
01:08:14,017 --> 01:08:16,024
You could ski
to your heart's content.

1110
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:17,982
Swim in the blue Caribbean.

1111
01:08:18,688 --> 01:08:21,950
I'd be waiting at our table
with a Scotch on the rocks.

1112
01:08:22,112 --> 01:08:24,152
Or a chilled Chilean Chardonnay.

1113
01:08:26,912 --> 01:08:28,635
The world would be your oyster.

1114
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,501
But what about Maggie?

1115
01:08:35,137 --> 01:08:36,892
Forget her.

1116
01:08:37,056 --> 01:08:38,998
Let her rot.

1117
01:08:39,712 --> 01:08:41,239
Stay with me.

1118
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:43,579
You're my kind of person.

1119
01:08:51,296 --> 01:08:53,565
It's quite tempting.

1120
01:09:03,487 --> 01:09:05,494
Hello?

1121
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,125
Hi.

1122
01:09:08,959 --> 01:09:10,748
It's going okay.

1123
01:09:13,663 --> 01:09:15,703
We're still talking.

1124
01:09:16,959 --> 01:09:19,926
We're on the right track.
It's all going okay.

1125
01:09:20,831 --> 01:09:22,773
Don't come down.

1126
01:09:22,943 --> 01:09:25,790
That would be a mistake.
It's all going fine.

1127
01:09:27,775 --> 01:09:29,662
I love you too.

1128
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:32,565
I am.

1129
01:09:33,246 --> 01:09:35,134
I'm kissing you.

1130
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:37,981
Oh, yes.

1131
01:09:38,814 --> 01:09:41,149
I can taste your mouth.

1132
01:09:46,142 --> 01:09:48,030
What the hell did she want?

1133
01:09:48,543 --> 01:09:50,681
She wants that divorce.

1134
01:09:52,478 --> 01:09:54,420
What about my proposition?

1135
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:00,725
Well, I like the idea of Jamaica.

1136
01:10:00,894 --> 01:10:04,210
-What about Barbados?
-Well, and Barbados, and Antigua.

1137
01:10:04,382 --> 01:10:06,803
Yeah, it's true. There's so many
places I haven't seen.

1138
01:10:06,974 --> 01:10:09,789
Hollywood. Saint Petersburg.

1139
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:12,317
The Cte d'Azur, Coney Island.

1140
01:10:12,478 --> 01:10:16,122
And I hear there's that wonderful hotel
in Scotland called Balmoral.

1141
01:10:16,286 --> 01:10:19,003
-That's where the queen lives.
-So bed and breakfast is out.

1142
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:21,500
-It's on if you know the queen.
-I don't.

1143
01:10:21,661 --> 01:10:22,905
I do.

1144
01:10:23,581 --> 01:10:25,108
That's fantastic.

1145
01:10:27,742 --> 01:10:29,530
But seriously, though.

1146
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:32,115
We could have
such a wonderful time together.

1147
01:10:32,285 --> 01:10:33,692
Venice? Disneyland?

1148
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,764
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

1149
01:10:36,925 --> 01:10:37,907
Whoever you want.

1150
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:41,242
I could introduce you
to whoever you want.

1151
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:43,860
Kissinger? Dick Cheney?

1152
01:10:44,029 --> 01:10:45,175
Madonna? Mike Tyson?

1153
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:46,323
-Yes.
-Yes?

1154
01:10:47,197 --> 01:10:51,256
I must say, that as offers go...

1155
01:10:52,413 --> 01:10:55,315
...it's quite tempting.

1156
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:00,538
You're a naughty tempter,
aren't you?

1157
01:11:02,428 --> 01:11:06,651
I'm so glad you like my mind.
Not many people like my mind.

1158
01:11:06,813 --> 01:11:08,755
Quite a few people like my body...

1159
01:11:08,925 --> 01:11:11,380
...but I can't think of anyone
who likes my mind.

1160
01:11:12,636 --> 01:11:15,091
That makes you unique.

1161
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,388
But then, of course,
you know what they say.

1162
01:11:18,556 --> 01:11:20,465
The mind is the body.

1163
01:11:21,469 --> 01:11:22,483
Is that what they say?

1164
01:11:22,652 --> 01:11:25,783
Somebody said something like it once.
Bullshit, of course. Anyway....

1165
01:11:26,684 --> 01:11:30,164
Perhaps I am your sort of person.
Who knows?

1166
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:35,889
But you would have
to be very nice to me.

1167
01:11:36,092 --> 01:11:39,954
For instance,
just at this moment, I need a drink.

1168
01:11:49,915 --> 01:11:51,824
You can get your own drink.

1169
01:11:51,995 --> 01:11:54,864
No, you get it for me
and I might be nice to you.

1170
01:11:55,035 --> 01:11:57,206
-Nice to me?
-That's what I said.

1171
01:11:57,371 --> 01:11:58,549
Whisky, please.

1172
01:12:16,923 --> 01:12:20,916
Can't deny, I can be
quite a congenial companion.

1173
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:22,992
I really-- I can't deny it.

1174
01:12:25,723 --> 01:12:31,920
I could be quite a witty companion.

1175
01:12:32,826 --> 01:12:37,561
Would you like a witty companion?

1176
01:12:37,722 --> 01:12:42,359
-Very much.
-I'm particularly witty in the morning.

1177
01:12:42,522 --> 01:12:43,732
Would that suit you?

1178
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:50,225
Some people hate wit in the morning.
What about you?

1179
01:12:50,393 --> 01:12:51,800
I love wit in the morning.

1180
01:12:53,594 --> 01:12:55,416
Over boiled eggs?

1181
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:59,224
Do you like eggs?

1182
01:12:59,801 --> 01:13:00,783
Absolutely.

1183
01:13:05,786 --> 01:13:08,273
I'm a dab hand in the kitchen.

1184
01:13:08,826 --> 01:13:14,739
But you have to be nice to me
and get me a drink when I ask for it.

1185
01:13:36,569 --> 01:13:38,130
You see?

1186
01:13:39,512 --> 01:13:42,546
You can be really sweet...

1187
01:13:42,713 --> 01:13:44,818
...when you put your mind to it.

1188
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:46,578
Cheers.

1189
01:13:51,609 --> 01:13:54,391
Listen, I can see what you're saying.

1190
01:13:54,553 --> 01:13:57,749
I can see why
you're inviting me to live with you.

1191
01:13:57,912 --> 01:14:00,279
I can see that you're lonely.

1192
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,756
That you need looking after.
It's obvious.

1193
01:14:03,928 --> 01:14:07,703
You need someone
who would cater for your every whim.

1194
01:14:07,864 --> 01:14:09,719
Don't you?

1195
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,309
I do.

1196
01:14:17,976 --> 01:14:20,976
Hello? Darling.

1197
01:14:21,143 --> 01:14:22,518
What?

1198
01:14:25,304 --> 01:14:26,830
Oh, is that so?

1199
01:14:26,999 --> 01:14:28,406
Are you?

1200
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,229
I see.

1201
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,025
Are you sure?

1202
01:14:35,191 --> 01:14:36,685
I see.

1203
01:14:37,367 --> 01:14:39,058
I got it.

1204
01:14:41,079 --> 01:14:43,981
I told you I got it. I understand.

1205
01:14:44,823 --> 01:14:46,318
Okay.

1206
01:14:47,095 --> 01:14:50,412
-Okay, I'll tell him.
-Tell me what?

1207
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:57,206
-That she loves you.
-ls that so?

1208
01:14:57,366 --> 01:14:59,887
-What else did she say?
-Nothing.

1209
01:15:00,055 --> 01:15:01,232
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

1210
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:04,782
Listen, for chrissake,
make up your mind.

1211
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:09,107
I'm offering you something special.
Something very special.

1212
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:12,882
We seal it with a handshake.
And she's nowhere.

1213
01:15:13,046 --> 01:15:16,624
We cut her out, you understand?
We cut her out of our lives.

1214
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:18,895
Don't let her dominate you.
Be yourself.

1215
01:15:19,062 --> 01:15:21,648
-Be independent. Be free.
-Like you?

1216
01:15:21,815 --> 01:15:24,433
That's right. Be free like me.

1217
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:03,083
I've always been attracted...

1218
01:16:03,253 --> 01:16:05,970
...to rich and powerful men.

1219
01:16:06,389 --> 01:16:09,138
Rich and powerful men
make all the girls quiver...

1220
01:16:09,301 --> 01:16:12,084
...Iike a jelly on a plate.

1221
01:16:12,245 --> 01:16:13,521
But you're not a girl.

1222
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:19,216
Tickles the old cobblers, money.

1223
01:16:19,381 --> 01:16:23,309
-Girls don't have cobblers.
-You'd be surprised.

1224
01:16:28,181 --> 01:16:30,090
But you're not a girl.

1225
01:16:30,965 --> 01:16:33,037
I may be once.

1226
01:16:33,876 --> 01:16:36,243
Back in the good old days.

1227
01:16:37,845 --> 01:16:40,463
Maybe the good old days
are coming back.

1228
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:43,306
Who knows?

1229
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,031
Look....

1230
01:16:48,628 --> 01:16:51,497
I'd really like to see your bed.

1231
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:55,723
I mean, let me be quite clear.

1232
01:16:55,892 --> 01:16:59,635
This looks a very nice bed indeed.

1233
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:03,020
But yours is bigger.

1234
01:17:05,043 --> 01:17:08,458
-Can I take another look?
-Sure.

1235
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,587
Is this how you do it?

1236
01:17:18,516 --> 01:17:20,458
Miraculous.

1237
01:17:30,867 --> 01:17:33,518
I could really get to like this.

1238
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:38,637
Of course,
this is the marriage bed, isn't it?

1239
01:17:39,763 --> 01:17:42,348
Is this where she took
your virginity?

1240
01:17:42,515 --> 01:17:44,751
Is this where your wife
deflowered you?

1241
01:17:44,915 --> 01:17:47,467
Is this where you were deflowered?

1242
01:17:49,299 --> 01:17:51,186
It's a lovely bed.

1243
01:17:51,986 --> 01:17:54,921
So bouncy.

1244
01:18:00,403 --> 01:18:05,770
I'm so touched that you've
offered me a place in your heart.

1245
01:18:05,938 --> 01:18:08,207
In your life.

1246
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:10,225
I'm touched.

1247
01:18:21,106 --> 01:18:23,113
Take your hand off me.

1248
01:18:25,425 --> 01:18:27,760
Take your hand off me.

1249
01:18:30,098 --> 01:18:32,748
Fuck off. Fuck off, you big poof!

1250
01:18:33,169 --> 01:18:36,431
Jesus. I come here
as an innocent bystander.

1251
01:18:36,593 --> 01:18:39,113
As a totally respectable individual.

1252
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:42,729
A humble part-time hairdresser.
And you try to corrupt me.

1253
01:18:42,898 --> 01:18:45,680
You try to seduce me.
Do you know what you are?

1254
01:18:45,841 --> 01:18:46,823
You're a menace.

1255
01:18:46,994 --> 01:18:50,703
Also, you're a cunt.

1256
01:18:51,505 --> 01:18:55,214
Well, now you really are charming.

1257
01:18:55,377 --> 01:18:57,614
-Know who's gonna love this story?
-What story?

1258
01:18:57,777 --> 01:18:59,271
-This one. This one.
-Who?

1259
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:00,782
-Maggie.
-Really?

1260
01:19:01,105 --> 01:19:03,144
By the way, she asked me
to tell you something.

1261
01:19:03,313 --> 01:19:05,069
-What?
-That she's coming back to you.

1262
01:19:05,617 --> 01:19:08,846
-She's on her way.
-She's coming back to me?

1263
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:11,375
-That's what she told me.
-I don't want her.

1264
01:19:11,537 --> 01:19:14,220
Well, you've got her. She's all yours.
You're welcome to her.

1265
01:19:14,384 --> 01:19:18,541
She loves your money, baby.
That's the nub of it.

1266
01:19:19,408 --> 01:19:20,870
I don't want her.

1267
01:19:26,545 --> 01:19:28,846
-What are you doing with that coat?
-I'm taking it.

1268
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,763
Tell Maggie I'll be in touch.

1269
01:19:30,928 --> 01:19:33,830
I want to have a drink with her.
Bring her up to date.

1270
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,848
How do you like me in this coat?
Do you fancy me?

1271
01:19:43,504 --> 01:19:46,155
Goodbye, darling.

1272
01:19:50,511 --> 01:19:52,104
Wait a minute.

1273
01:19:53,295 --> 01:19:55,150
Yes? What?

1274
01:20:02,383 --> 01:20:04,205
Goodbye, darling.

1275
01:21:04,206 --> 01:21:05,206
