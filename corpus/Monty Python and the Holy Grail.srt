1
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,389
Whoa, there!

2
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,755
Halt!

3
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,548
Who goes there?

4
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,594
lt is l, Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon,
from the castle of Camelot.

5
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,919
King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons.

6
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,630
Sovereign of all England!

7
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,433
Pull the other one.

8
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,637
l am, and this my trusty servant, Patsy.

9
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,356
We have ridden the length of the land
in search of knights...

10
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,195
...who will join me in my court at Camelot.
l must speak with your lord and master.

11
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,791
-What? Ridden on a horse?
-Yes.

12
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,151
-You're using coconuts!
-What?

13
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,114
You've got two empty halves of coconut,
and you're banging them together.

14
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,749
So? We have ridden since
the snows of winter covered this land.

15
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,910
-Through the Kingdom of Mercia.
-Where did you get the coconuts?

16
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,115
We found them.

17
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,317
Found them? ln Mercia?
The coconut is tropical.

18
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,314
-What do you mean?
-Well, this is a temperate zone.

19
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,949
The swallow may fly south with the sun,
or the house martin or the plover...

20
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,192
...may seek warmer climes in winter,
yet these are not strangers to our land.

21
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,631
-Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
-Not at all. They could be carried.

22
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,272
-What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
-lt could grip it by the husk.

23
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,556
lt's not a question of where he grips it.
lt's a simple question of weight ratio.

24
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,993
A 5-ounce bird could not carry
a 1-pound coconut.

25
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,790
lt doesn't matter. Go tell your master
that Arthur from Camelot is here.

26
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,232
ln order to maintain air-speed velocity...

27
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,712
...a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second, right?

28
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,871
-Please!
-Am l right?

29
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,633
-l'm not interested.
-lt could be carried by an African swallow.

30
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,831
Oh, yes! An African swallow, maybe.
Not a European swallow. That's my point.

31
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,148
l agree with that.

32
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,153
Will you ask your master
if he wants to join my court at Camelot?

33
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,238
But then, of course,
African swallows are non-migratory.

34
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,392
-Oh, yes.
-They couldn't bring a coconut, anyway.

35
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,476
Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows
carried it together?

36
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,351
-No, they'd have to have it on a line.
-Simple. They'd use a strand of creeper.

37
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,912
-Held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
-Why not?

38
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,559
Bring out your dead!

39
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,195
Ninepence.

40
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,270
-Bring out your dead.
-Here's one.

41
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,510
Ninepence.

42
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,158
-l'm not dead!
-What?

43
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,800
-Nothing. There's your ninepence.
-l'm not dead!

44
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,030
-He says he's not dead.
-Yes, he is.

45
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,553
-l'm not!
-He isn't.

46
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,108
-He will be soon. He's very ill.
-l'm getting better!

47
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,872
You'll be stone dead in a moment.

48
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,520
l can't take him like that.
lt's against regulations.

49
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,797
-l don't want to go on the cart.
-Don't be such a baby.

50
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,950
-l can't take him.
-l feel fine.

51
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,996
-Well, do us a favour.
-l can't.

52
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,594
Can you hang around a few minutes?
He won't be long.

53
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,274
Got to go to the Robinsons'.
They've lost nine today.

54
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,078
-When's your next round?
-Thursday.

55
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,755
-l think l'll go for a walk.
-You're not fooling anyone, you know.

56
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,675
-lsn't there something you can do?
-l feel happy.

57
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,753
-Thanks very much.
-Not at all. See you on Thursday.

58
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,875
Right.

59
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,478
-Who's that, then?
-l don't know. Must be a king.

60
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,228
-Why?
-He hasn't got shit all over him.

61
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,473
-Old woman!
-Man!

62
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,396
Man. Sorry.
What knight lives in that castle over there?

63
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,431
-l'm 37.
-What?

64
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,635
-l'm 37. l'm not old.
-l can't just call you ''man.''

65
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,598
-You could say, ''Dennis.''
-l didn't know you were a Dennis.

66
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,272
You didn't bother to find out.

67
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,999
l did say sorry about the ''old woman,''
but from behind--

68
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,231
What l object to
is that you treat me like an inferior.

69
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,073
-Well, l am king.
-King? Very nice.

70
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,359
How did you get that?
By exploiting the workers!

71
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,036
By hanging on to outdated
imperialist dogma which perpetuates...

72
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,998
...the economic and social differences
in our society!

73
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,392
-lf there's ever going to be any progress--
-There's some lovely filth down here.

74
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,549
How do you do?

75
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,518
How do you do, good lady?
l am Arthur, King of the Britons.

76
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,909
-Whose castle is that?
-King of the who?

77
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,110
-The Britons.
-Who are the Britons?

78
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,198
We all are. We're all Britons.
And l am your king.

79
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,952
Didn't know we had a king.
We're an autonomous collective.

80
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,793
You're fooling yourself.
We're living in a dictatorship.

81
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,838
A self-perpetuating autocracy
in which the working class--

82
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,275
There you go. Bringing class into it again.

83
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,672
-That's what it's all about. lf only people--
-Please, good people. l am in haste.

84
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,553
Who lives in that castle?

85
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,436
-No one lives there.
-Who is your lord?

86
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,317
-We don't have a lord.
-What?

87
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,278
l told you.
We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.

88
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,990
We take turns to act as
a sort of executive officer for the week.

89
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,514
-Yes.
-But all the decisions of that officer...

90
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,512
-...are ratified at a biweekly meeting.
-Yes, l see.

91
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,751
-By majority in the case of internal affairs.
-Be quiet!

92
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,072
-By a two-thirds majority in the case of--
-Be quiet! l order you to be quiet.

93
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,471
''Order.'' Who does he think he is?

94
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,068
-l am your king!
-l didn't vote for you.

95
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,517
-You don't vote for kings.
-How did you become king then?

96
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,511
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad
in the purest shimmering samite...

97
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,872
...held aloft Excalibur
from the bosom of the water...

98
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,156
...signifying, by divine providence,
that l, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.

99
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,119
That is why l'm your king!

100
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,512
Listen. Strange women lying in ponds,
distributing swords, is no basis...

101
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,751
...for a system of government.
Supreme executive power...

102
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,231
...derives from a mandate from the masses.
Not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

103
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,230
Be quiet!

104
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,437
You can't expect to wield
supreme executive power...

105
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,988
...'cause some watery tart
threw a sword at you.

106
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,197
-Shut up!
-lf l went around saying l was an emperor...

107
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,353
...because some moistened bint had lobbed
a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!

108
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,399
-Will you shut up?
-See the violence inherent in the system.

109
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,996
-Shut up!
-See the violence inherent in the system!

110
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,038
-Help, l'm being repressed!
-Bloody peasant!

111
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,429
What a give away. Did you hear that?

112
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,193
That's what l'm on about.
Did you see him repressing me?

113
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,232
You fight with the strength of many men,
Sir Knight.

114
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,350
l am Arthur, King of the Britons.

115
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,832
l seek the finest and bravest knights
in the land to join me in Camelot.

116
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,277
You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?

117
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,638
You make me sad. So be it. Come, Patsy.

118
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,552
None shall pass.

119
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,911
-What?
-None shall pass.

120
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,155
l have no quarrel with you, good
Sir Knight, but l must cross this bridge.

121
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,356
Then you shall die.

122
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,988
l command you, as King of the Britons,
to stand aside.

123
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,716
l move for no man.

124
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,589
So be it!

125
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,231
Now, stand aside, worthy adversary.

126
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,392
-'Tis but a scratch.
-''A scratch''? Your arm's off.

127
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,795
-No, it isn't.
-Well, what's that, then?

128
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,239
-l've had worse.
-You liar.

129
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,878
Come on, you pansy!

130
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,919
Victory is mine.

131
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,750
We thank thee, Lord, that in thy--

132
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,513
-Come on, then.
-What?

133
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,989
Have at you.

134
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,995
You are brave, Sir Knight,
but the fight is mine.

135
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,433
Had enough, eh?

136
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,034
Look, you stupid bastard.
You've got no arms left.

137
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,519
-Yes, l have.
-Look!

138
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,353
Just a flesh wound.

139
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,709
-Look, stop that.
-Chicken!

140
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,995
l'll have your leg. Right!

141
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,195
-Right! l'll do you for that.
-You'll what?

142
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,078
-Come here.
-What are you going to do? Bleed on me?

143
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,799
-l am invincible!
-You're a loony.

144
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,035
The Black Knight always triumphs.
Have at you!

145
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,234
Come on, then.

146
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,271
All right, we'll call it a draw.

147
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,469
-Come, Patsy.
-Oh, l see.

148
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,396
Running away? You yellow bastard!

149
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,433
Come back here and take what's coming
to you! l'll bite your legs off!

150
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,828
''Pie Jesu Domine

151
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,638
''Dona eis requiem

152
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,669
''Pie Jesu Domine

153
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,030
''Dona eis requiem''

154
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,591
-A witch!
-We found a witch.

155
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,750
-We got a witch.
-We found a witch.

156
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,879
We've got a witch.

157
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,151
Burn her!

158
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,955
-We have found a witch. May we burn her?
-Burn her!

159
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,518
-How do you know she is a witch?
-She looks like one.

160
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,879
Bring her forward.

161
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,872
-l am not a witch.
-But you are dressed as one.

162
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,913
-They dressed me up like this.
-We didn't!

163
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,036
And this isn't my nose. lt's a false one.

164
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,036
-Well?
-Well, we did do the nose.

165
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,593
-The nose?
-And the hat. But she is a witch.

166
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,758
Burn her!

167
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,593
-Did you dress her up like this?
-No. Yes.

168
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,111
Yes, a bit. She has got a wart.

169
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,434
-What makes you think she is a witch?
-Well, she turned me into a newt.

170
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,909
A newt?

171
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,234
l got better.

172
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,040
-Burn her anyway.
-Burn her!

173
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,276
Quiet! There are ways of telling
whether she is a witch.

174
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,231
-Are there? What are they? Tell us.
-Do they hurt?

175
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,478
Tell me: What do you do with witches?

176
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,915
Burn them!

177
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,555
-What do you burn apart from witches?
-More witches!

178
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,196
-Wood.
-So, why do witches burn?

179
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,634
-'Cause they're made of wood?
-Good.

180
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,950
So, how do we tell
whether she is made of wood?

181
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,556
-Build a bridge out of her.
-Can you not also make bridges of stone?

182
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,749
Oh, yeah.

183
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,115
Does wood sink in water?

184
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,795
-No.
-lt floats.

185
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,518
Throw her into the pond!

186
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,398
-What also floats in water?
-Bread.

187
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,197
-Apples.
-Very small rocks.

188
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,200
-Cider. Gravy. Cherries.
-Nuts.

189
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,358
-Churches.
-Lead.

190
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,549
A duck!

191
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,829
Exactly.

192
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,158
So, logically....

193
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,198
lf she...

194
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,235
...weighs the same as a duck...

195
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,113
...she's made of wood.

196
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,599
And, therefore....

197
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,119
-A witch!
-A witch!

198
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,756
We shall use my largest scales.

199
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,636
Right. Remove the supports!

200
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,358
-lt's a fair cop.
-Burn her!

201
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,157
Who are you,
who are so wise in the ways of science?

202
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,471
-l am Arthur, King of the Britons.
-My liege.

203
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,555
Good Sir Knight, will you come to Camelot,
and join us at the Round Table?

204
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,111
My liege, l would be honoured.

205
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,188
-What is your name?
-Bedevere, my liege.

206
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,234
Then l dub you, Sir Bedevere...

207
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,911
...knight of the Round Table.

208
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,755
The wise Sir Bedevere was the first
to join King Arthur's knights.

209
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,793
But other illustrious names
were soon to follow.

210
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,038
Sir Lancelot the Brave.

211
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,638
Sir Galahad the Pure.

212
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,278
And Sir Robin,
the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot...

213
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,510
...who had nearly fought
the Dragon of Angnor...

214
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,558
...who nearly stood up to
the vicious Chicken of Bristol...

215
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,235
...and who had personally wet himself
at the Battle of Badon Hill.

216
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,790
And the aptly named
Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.

217
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,798
Together they formed a band...

218
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,555
...whose names and deeds
were to be retold throughout the centuries.

219
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,910
The Knights of the Round Table.

220
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,916
That, my liege, is how we know
the Earth to be banana-shaped.

221
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,355
This new learning amazes me,
Sir Bedevere.

222
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,115
Explain again how sheep's bladders
may be employed to prevent earthquakes.

223
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,918
-Certainly, sir.
-Look, my liege.

224
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,752
-Camelot.
-Camelot.

225
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,871
-Camelot.
-lt's only a model.

226
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,074
Knights, l bid you welcome
to your new home.

227
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,714
Let us ride to Camelot!

228
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,631
''We're knights of the Round Table
We dance whene'er we're able

229
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,678
''We do routines and chorus scenes
With footwork impeccable

230
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,718
''We dine well here in Camelot
We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot

231
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,473
''We're knights of the Round Table
Our shows are formidable

232
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,878
''But many times
We're given rhymes

233
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,713
''That are quite unsingable
We're opera mad in Camelot

234
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,870
''We sing from the diaphragm a lot

235
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,400
''ln war we're tough and able

236
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,993
''Quite indefatigable

237
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,157
''Between our quests
We sequin vests

238
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,312
''And impersonate Clark Gable
lt's a busy life in Camelot

239
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,559
''l have to push the pram a lot''

240
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,596
No, on second thoughts,
let's not go to Camelot. lt is a silly place.

241
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,874
Right.

242
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,871
Arthur.

243
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,719
King of the Britons.

244
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,075
Don't grovel. If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's people grovelling.

245
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,798
-Sorry.
-And don't apologize.

246
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,676
Every time I talk to someone it's
''sorry this,'' and, ''forgive me that''...

247
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,318
...and, ''I'm not worthy.''

248
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,074
-What are you doing now?
-l'm averting my eyes, O Lord.

249
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,517
Don't. It's like those miserable psalms.
They're so depressing.

250
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,392
-Now, knock it off!
-Yes, Lord.

251
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,836
Right. Arthur, King of the Britons.

252
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,914
Your knights of the Round Table
shall have a task...

253
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,594
...to make them an example
in these dark times.

254
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,274
-Good idea, O Lord!
-'Course it's a good idea.

255
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,509
Behold, Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.

256
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,197
Look well, Arthur,
for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.

257
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,750
That is your purpose, Arthur.

258
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,279
The quest for the Holy Grail.

259
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,590
-A blessing from the Lord.
-God be praised!

260
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,195
Halt!

261
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,755
Hello!

262
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,109
Hello!

263
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,239
Hello. Who is it?

264
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,996
lt is King Arthur, and these are
my knights of the Round Table.

265
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,633
Whose castle is this?

266
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,991
This is the castle of my master,
Guy de Loimbard.

267
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,829
Go and tell your master
that we have been charged by God...

268
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,678
...with a sacred quest. lf he will give us
food and shelter for the night...

269
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,833
...he can join us in our quest
for the Holy Grail.

270
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,197
Well, l'll ask him,
but l don't think he'll be very keen.

271
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,271
He's already got one, you see.

272
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,755
-What?
-He says they've already got one!

273
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,715
-Are you sure he's got one?
-Oh, yes. lt's very nice.

274
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,630
l told him we've already got one.

275
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,798
-Can we come up, and have a look?
-Of course not! You are English-types.

276
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,555
-Well, what are you then?
-l'm French.

277
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,428
Why do you think l have
this outrageous accent, you silly king?

278
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,992
-What are you doing in England?
-Mind your own business.

279
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,189
lf you will not show us the Grail,
we shall take your castle by force.

280
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,317
You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!

281
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,668
Go and boil your bottoms,
sons of a silly person.

282
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,669
l blow my nose at you,
so-called Arthur King.

283
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,793
You and all your silly English knights.

284
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,631
-What a strange person.
-Now look here, my good man--

285
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,995
l don't want to talk to you no more...

286
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,397
...you empty-headed,
animal food-trough wiper.

287
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,394
l fart in your general direction.

288
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,556
Your mother was a hamster,
and your father smelt of elderberries.

289
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,280
ls there someone else up there
we could talk to?

290
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,114
No. Now go away,
or l shall taunt you a second time.

291
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,915
Now, this is your last chance.
l've been more than reasonable....

292
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,393
-Fetchez la vache!
-Quoi?

293
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,276
Fetchez la vache!

294
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,118
lf you do not agree to my commands,
then l shall--

295
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,148
Jesus Christ!

296
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,235
Right! Charge!

297
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,748
Run away! Run away!

298
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,075
-Fiends! l'll tear them apart.
-No, no.

299
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,993
Sir, l have a plan, sir.

300
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,589
-Un cadeau.
-What?

301
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,669
-A present.
-Un cadeau.

302
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,751
Oui, allons-y. Let's go.

303
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,315
What happens now?

304
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,269
Well, now, Lancelot, Galahad,
and l wait until nightfall...

305
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,513
...and then leap out of the rabbit,
taking the French by surprise.

306
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,514
Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!

307
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,674
Who leaps out?

308
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,674
Lancelot, Galahad, and l...

309
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,718
...leap out of the rabbit.

310
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,352
Look. lf we built this large,
wooden badger....

311
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,475
Run away!

312
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,308
-History for Schools. Take 8.
-Action!

313
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,395
Defeat at the castle seems to have
utterly disheartened King Arthur.

314
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,110
The ferocity of the French taunting
took him completely by surprise.

315
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,513
Arthur became convinced
that a new strategy was required...

316
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,912
...if the quest for the Holy Grail were
to be brought to a successful conclusion.

317
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,719
Arthur, having consulted
his closest knights...

318
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,193
...decided that they should separate,
and search for the Grail individually.

319
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,352
Now, this is what they did--

320
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,509
Frank!

321
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,675
The tale of Sir Robin.

322
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,473
So, each of the knights
went their separate ways.

323
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,877
Sir Robin rode north,
through the dark forest of Ewing...

324
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,554
...accompanied by his favourite minstrels.

325
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,309
''Bravely bold Sir Robin
Rode forth from Camelot

326
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,953
''He was not afraid to die
O, Brave Sir Robin

327
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,074
''He was not at all afraid
To be killed in nasty ways

328
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,114
''Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin

329
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,355
''He was not in the least bit scared
To be mashed into a pulp

330
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,113
''Or to have his eyes gouged out
And his elbows broken

331
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,074
''To have his kneecaps split
And his body burned away

332
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,432
''And his limbs all hacked and mangled
Brave Sir Robin

333
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,831
''His head smashed in
And his heart cut out

334
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,751
''His liver removed
And his bowels unplugged

335
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,673
''His nostrils raped, his bottom burned off
And his penis--''

336
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,558
That's enough music for now, lads.

337
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,157
Looks like there's dirty work afoot.

338
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,513
Anarcho-syndicalism
is a way of preserving freedom.

339
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,910
Dennis, forget about freedom.
Don't drop that mud.

340
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,515
Halt! Who art thou?

341
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,997
-''He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin--''
-Shut up!

342
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,717
Nobody, really. l was just passing through.

343
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,194
What do you want?

344
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,555
-''To fight and--''
-Shut up!

345
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,558
Nothing. Nothing, really.

346
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,631
-Just to pass through, good Sir Knight.
-I'm afraid not.

347
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,196
-Actually, l am a knight of the Round Table.
-You're a knight of the Round Table?

348
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,556
l am.

349
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,790
-In that case, I have to kill you.
-Shall I?

350
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,996
-I don't think so.
-What do I think?

351
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,832
-Kill him.
-Let's be nice to him.

352
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,989
-Shut up.
-But--

353
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,796
And you!

354
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,030
Get the sword out.
I want to cut his head off!

355
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,839
-Cut your own head off.
-Yes, do us all a favour.

356
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,876
-What?
-Yapping on all the time.

357
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,599
-You're lucky you're not next to him.
-What do you mean?

358
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,636
-You snore.
-I don't.

359
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,877
-You've got bad breath.
-Only because you don't brush my teeth.

360
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,235
Stop bitching, and let's go and have tea!

361
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,279
All right! We'll kill him first,
and then have tea and biscuits.

362
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,634
-Yes.
-Not biscuits.

363
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,030
All right! Not biscuits.
But let's kill him anyway.

364
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,155
Right.

365
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,870
-He's buggered off!
-So he has! He's scarpered.

366
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,269
-''Brave Sir Robin ran away''
-No!

367
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,238
-''Bravely ran away, away''
-l didn't.

368
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,874
''When danger reared its ugly head
He bravely turned his tail and fled

369
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,669
''Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about
And gallantly he chickened out

370
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,715
''Bravely taking to his feet
He beat a very brave retreat

371
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,673
-''Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin''
-l never!

372
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,788
''Pie Jesu Domine

373
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,638
''Dona eis requiem''

00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,590
The tale of Sir Galahad.

375
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,991
Open the door.

376
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,112
ln the name of King Arthur, open the door!

377
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,710
Hello!

378
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,915
Welcome, gentle Sir Knight.
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

379
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,395
-The Castle Anthrax?
-Yes.

380
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,356
lt's not a very good name, is it?

381
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,797
But we are nice, and we will attend
to your every, every need!

382
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,955
You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?

383
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,355
-The what?
-The Grail. lt is here?

384
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,153
But you are tired,
and you must rest awhile.

385
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,993
Midget! Crapper!

386
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,192
-Yes, O Zoot?
-Prepare a bed for our guest.

387
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,108
-Thank you, Zoot.
-Thank you.

388
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,832
Away, away, varletesses!

389
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,479
The beds here are warm and soft,
and very, very big.

390
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,599
-Look, l--
-What is your name, handsome knight?

391
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,911
Sir Galahad the Chaste.

392
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,913
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot.

393
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,554
-But come.
-Please, in God's name, show me the Grail.

394
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,593
You have suffered much. You are delirious.

395
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,319
-Look, l have seen it. lt is here.
-Sir Galahad!

396
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,188
You would not be so ungallant
as to refuse our hospitality.

397
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:02,240
l'm afraid our life must seem very dull
and quiet, compared to yours.

398
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,750
We're 8 score blondes and brunettes,
all between 16 and 19 and a half...

399
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,158
...cut off in this castle,
with no one to protect us.

400
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,719
lt is a lonely life.

401
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,309
Bathing, dressing, undressing,
making exciting underwear.

402
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,194
We are just not used to handsome knights.

403
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,988
Nay. Come. You may lie here.

404
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,389
-But you are wounded!
-No, it's nothing!

405
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,674
You must see the doctors immediately.
Please, lie down.

406
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,835
-Well, what seems to be the trouble?
-They're doctors?

407
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,156
They have a basic medical training.

408
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,120
Come, come, you must try to rest.

409
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,758
Dr. Piglet! Dr. Winston! Practice your art.

410
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,639
-Try to relax.
-Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?

411
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,513
We must examine you.

412
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,591
-There's nothing wrong with that.
-Please. We are doctors.

413
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,433
Look, this cannot be.

414
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,155
-l am sworn to chastity!
-Back to your bed!

415
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,913
Torment me no longer.
l have seen the Grail.

416
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,959
-There's no Grail here.
-l have seen it.

417
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,479
-l have seen--
-Hello.

418
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,268
Hello.

419
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,795
-Zoot!
-l am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.

420
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,554
-Where are you going?
-l seek the Grail.

421
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,796
l have seen it here in this castle!

422
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,038
Oh, no. Bad, bad Zoot!

423
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,557
-What is it?
-Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!

424
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,079
She has been setting light to our beacon,
which is Grail-shaped.

425
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,710
lt's not the first time
we've had this problem.

426
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,438
lt's not the real Grail?

427
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,518
Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot.

428
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,837
She is a bad person,
and must pay the penalty.

429
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,630
Do you think this scene
should have been cut?

430
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,473
We were so worried
when the boys were writing it.

431
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,757
But now we're glad. lt's better
than some previous scenes, l think.

432
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,553
Ours was better visually.

433
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,279
Ours was committed.
lt wasn't a string of pussy jokes.

434
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,794
-Get on with it.
-Yes. Get on with it!

435
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,394
Get on with it!

436
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,555
-l am enjoying this scene.
-Get on with it!

437
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,119
Wicked, wicked Zoot!

438
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,952
She must pay the penalty.

439
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,756
ln Castle Anthrax, we have a punishment
for setting alight the Grail-shaped beacon.

440
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,158
You must tie her down on a bed,
and spank her.

441
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,396
A spanking! A spanking!

442
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,314
You must spank her, and after you've
spanked her, deal with her as you like.

443
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,595
-And, then, spank me.
-And me!

444
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,749
-And me.
-And me.

445
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,229
Yes. You must give us all
a good spanking!

446
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,799
A spanking!

447
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,794
-And, after the spanking, the oral sex.
-The oral sex!

448
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,551
Well, l could stay a bit longer.

449
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,716
-Sir Galahad!
-Hello.

450
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,109
-Quick! You are in great peril.
-Why?

451
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,430
-No, he isn't!
-Silence, foul temptress!

452
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,715
-She's got a point.
-We'll cover your escape!

453
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,439
-Look, l'm fine!
-Wait, Sir Galahad!

454
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,593
-l can tackle this lot single-handed!
-Yes, let him tackle us single-handed!

455
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,999
No, Sir Galahad. Come!

456
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,310
Honestly, l can handle this lot easily!

457
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,914
-Yes, let him handle us easily.
-No, sir. Quick!

458
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,310
Wait! Please! l can defeat them!
There's only 150 of them!

459
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,313
He'll beat us easily. We haven't a chance.

460
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,474
Oh, shit!

461
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,479
-You were in great peril.
-l don't think l was.

462
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,993
You were in terrible peril.

463
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,117
-Let me go back, and face the peril.
-No, it's too perilous.

464
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,435
lt's my duty to sample as much peril
as l can.

465
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,192
We've got to find the Holy Grail.

466
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,919
-Let me have just a bit of peril?
-No. lt's unhealthy.

467
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,956
-l bet you're gay.
-No, l'm not.

468
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,035
Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad
from almost certain temptation.

469
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,754
But, they were still no nearer the Grail.

470
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,555
King Arthur and Sir Bedevere,
not more than a swallow's flight away...

471
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,471
...had discovered something.

472
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,914
That's an unladen swallow's flight,
obviously.

473
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,355
They were more than
two laden swallow's flights away.

474
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,590
Four, with a coconut
on a line between them.

475
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,238
If the birds were--

476
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,151
Get on with it!

477
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,195
Oh, anyway...

478
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,636
...on to Scene 24, which is a smashing
scene, with some lovely acting...

479
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,790
...in which Arthur discovers a vital clue.

480
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,678
There aren't any swallows,
but I think you can hear a--

481
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,195
And this enchanter of whom you speak,
he has seen the Grail?

482
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,633
Where does he live?

483
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,353
Old man, where does he live?

484
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,316
He knows of a cave.
A cave which no man has entered.

485
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,156
-And the Grail. The Grail is there?
-There is much danger.

486
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,633
For beyond the cave
lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril...

487
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,469
...which no man has ever crossed.

488
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,229
But the Grail. Where is the Grail?

489
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,758
Seek you the Bridge of Death.

490
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,994
The Bridge of Death?
Which leads to the Grail?

491
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,155
-Who are you?
-We are the knights who say, ''Ni''!

492
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,754
-No! Not the knights who say ''Ni''?
-The same!

493
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,435
-Who are they?
-We are the keepers of the sacred words.

494
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,157
''Ni,'' ''Peng,'' and ''Neee Wom''!

495
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,349
Those who hear them
seldom live to tell the tale.

496
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,638
The knights who say, ''Ni''
demand a sacrifice.

497
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,154
Knights of Ni,
we are but simple travellers...

498
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,834
...who seek the enchanter
who lives beyond these woods.

499
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,035
Ni! Ni!

500
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,117
We shall say, ''Ni'' again to you,
if you do not appease us.

501
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,712
-What is it you want?
-We want...

502
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,512
...a shrubbery.

503
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,349
A what?

504
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,399
-Ni! Ni!
-Please! No more!

505
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,075
-We will find you a shrubbery.
-You must return with a shrubbery...

506
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,391
...or else you will never pass
through this wood...

507
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,233
...alive.

508
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,829
Knights of Ni, you are just and fair.

509
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,673
-We will return with a shrubbery.
-One that looks nice.

510
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,637
-Of course.
-And not too expensive.

511
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,871
-Yes.
-Now go!

512
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,115
Stop that! Stop that!

513
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,999
Go on, be off! Go away.

514
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,393
And you, be off!

515
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,669
Bloody weather.

516
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,071
The tale of Sir Lancelot.

517
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,358
One day, lad, all this will be yours.

518
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,869
-What, the curtains?
-No, not the curtains.

519
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,238
All that you can see,
stretched out over the hills and valleys.

520
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,072
That'll be your kingdom, lad.

521
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,832
-But, Mother.
-Father, lad.

522
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,470
-But, Father, l don't want any of that.
-Listen, lad.

523
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:58,435
l built this kingdom up from nothing.
When l started here, it was a swamp.

524
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,672
Other kings said l was daft
to build a castle on the swamp.

525
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,752
But l built it all the same to show them.

526
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,958
lt sank into the swamp.

527
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,759
So, l built a second one.
That sank into the swamp.

528
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,515
So, l built a third one. That burned down,
fell over, then sank in the swamp.

529
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,511
But the fourth one stayed up.

530
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,311
And that's what you'll get, lad.

531
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,956
-The strongest castle in these isles.
-But l don't want any of that.

532
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,238
-l'd rather--
-Rather what?

533
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,078
l'd rather just...

534
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,193
-...sing.
-Stop that.

535
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,953
You're not going into a song
while l'm here!

536
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,270
ln 20 minutes, you're marrying a girl...

537
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,194
...whose father owns
the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.

538
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,959
-But l don't want land.
-Listen, Alice.

539
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,598
-Herbert.
-Herbert.

540
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,911
We live on a bloody swamp,
we need all the land we can get.

541
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,199
-But l don't like her.
-Don't like her?

542
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,359
What's wrong with her?

543
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,558
She's beautiful, she's rich.
She's got huge...

544
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,593
...tracts of land.

545
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,474
l know, but l want the girl
that l marry to have...

546
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,550
...a certain special something.

547
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,470
Cut that out!

548
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,112
You're marrying Princess Lucky,
so you'd better get used to the idea!

549
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,389
Guards!

550
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,957
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave
the room until l get him.

551
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,873
Not to leave the room,
even if you come and get him.

552
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,916
No. Until l come and get him.

553
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,312
Until you come and get him,
we're not to enter the room.

554
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,070
No, you stay in the room
and make sure he doesn't leave.

555
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,749
-And you'll come and get him.
-Right.

556
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,355
We don't need to do anything,
apart from stop him entering the room.

557
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,632
-No. Leaving the room.
-Leaving the room, yes.

558
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,876
-All right?
-lf....

559
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,269
-lf we're--
-Yes?

560
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,996
Look, it's quite simple.

561
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,119
You stay here and make sure
he doesn't leave the room.

562
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,231
-All right?
-l remember.

563
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,670
Can he can he leave the room with us?

564
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,755
No, you just keep him in here,
and make sure--

565
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,035
Yes! We'll keep him in here, obviously.

566
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,157
-But if he had to leave--
-No. Keep him in here!

567
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,874
-Until you, or anyone--
-Not anyone, just me.

568
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,235
-Just you....
-Get back.

569
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,515
-Right?
-Right.

570
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,511
We'll stay here until you get back.

571
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,273
-And make sure he doesn't leave.
-What?

572
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,518
-Make sure he doesn't leave.
-The Prince?

573
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,797
-Yes, make sure he doesn't leave.
-Yes, of course!

574
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,438
l thought you meant him!

575
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,035
lt seemed a bit daft
me having to guard him when he's a guard.

576
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,153
-ls that clear?
-Quite clear. No problems.

577
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,309
Right.

578
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,954
-Where are you going?
-We're coming with you.

579
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,999
l want you to stay here,
and make sure he doesn't leave.

580
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,674
l see, right.

581
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,955
-But, Father--
-Shut it, and get that suit on.

582
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,231
And no singing!

583
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,471
Go and get a glass of water.

584
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,748
-Well taken, Concorde!
-Thank you, sir, most kind.

585
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,319
And again!

586
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,592
Over we go! Good, steady!

587
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,796
Now, the big one!

588
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,556
Come on, Concorde!

589
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,631
Message for you, sir.

590
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,917
Concorde, speak to me!

591
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,792
''To whoever finds this note...

592
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,793
''...l have been imprisoned by my father...

593
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,674
''...who wishes me to marry
against my will.

594
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,194
''Please, please come and rescue me.

595
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,990
''l am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle.''

596
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,231
At last! A call! A cry of distress!

597
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,357
This could be the sign
that leads us to the Holy Grail!

598
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,871
Brave Concorde,
you shall not have died in vain!

599
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,838
l'm not quite dead, sir.

600
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,354
You shall not have been mortally wounded
in vain!

601
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,635
l think l could pull through, sir.

602
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,029
-l see.
-l think l'm all right to come with you.

603
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,792
No, sweet Concorde! Stay here.

604
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,917
l will send help as soon as
l have accomplished a daring and...

605
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,639
...heroic rescue in my own particular....

606
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,518
-ldiom, sir?
-ldiom!

607
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,911
-No, l feel fine, actually, sir.
-Farewell, sweet Concorde!

608
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,917
l'll just stay here, shall l, sir?

609
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,949
Yeah.

610
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,789
Hey!

611
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,270
You're not allowed to enter the room--

612
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,118
Fair one, behold your servant,
Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

613
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,954
-l have come to take.... l'm terribly sorry.
-You got my note!

614
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,989
-l got a note.
-You've come to rescue me?

615
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,073
-Well, no, you see--
-l knew someone would.

616
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,797
l knew that somewhere out there,
there must be someone--

617
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,676
Stop that! Stop it!

618
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,115
Who are you?

619
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,758
-l'm your son.
-No, not you.

620
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,912
-l'm Sir Lancelot, sir.
-He's come to rescue me, Father.

621
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,039
-Let's not jump to conclusions.
-Did you kill all those guards?

622
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,878
Yes. Sorry.

623
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,315
-They cost 50 pounds each.
-l'm awfully sorry.

624
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,313
Don't be afraid of him, Sir Lancelot.
l've got a rope ready.

625
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,315
You killed eight wedding guests and all!

626
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,710
Well, you see,
l thought your son was a lady.

627
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,074
l can understand that.

628
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,390
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry!
-Shut up!

629
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,756
-You only killed the bride's father!
-l didn't mean to.

630
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,479
Didn't mean to?
You put your sword through his head!

631
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,438
-Oh dear, is he all right?
-You kicked the bride in the chest!

632
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,909
-lt's going to cost me a fortune!
-l can explain.

633
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,629
l was in the forest, riding north
from Camelot when l got this note.

634
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,234
-Are you from Camelot?
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot!

635
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,191
l'm a knight of King Arthur, sir.

636
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,192
Very nice castle, Camelot.
Very good pig country.

637
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,952
-ls it?
-l am ready!

638
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,635
-Would you like to come have a drink?
-That's awfully nice of you.

639
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,997
-l am ready!
-l mean, to be so understanding.

640
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,834
You see, when l'm in this idiom,
l sometimes get a bit carried away.

641
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,550
Now, this is the main hall.
We'll have all this knocked through--

642
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,189
-There he is!
-Bloody hell.

643
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,795
-Hold it, please!
-See what l mean? l get carried away.

644
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,678
l'm really most awfully sorry.
Sorry, everyone.

645
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,113
He's killed the best man!

646
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:45,196
Hold it, please, hold it.
This is Sir Lancelot...

647
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,195
...from the Court of Camelot,
a brave and influential knight.

648
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,353
-And my special guest here today.
-Hello.

649
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,953
He killed my auntie!

650
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,157
No, please!
This is supposed to be a happy occasion!

651
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,028
Let's not bicker and argue
about who killed who.

652
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,072
We are here today to witness the union
of two young people...

653
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,430
...in the joyful bond of holy wedlock.

654
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,629
Unfortunately, one of them,
my son Herbert...

655
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,351
...has just fallen to his death.

656
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,516
But l don't want to think l've lost a son,
so much as...

657
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,598
...gained a daughter.

658
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,397
For, since the tragic death of her father--

659
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,471
He's not quite dead!

660
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,712
Since the near fatal wounding
of her father--

661
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,189
He's getting better!

662
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,557
For, since her own father...

663
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,837
...who, when he seemed about to recover...

664
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,590
...suddenly felt the icy hand of death
upon him.

665
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,595
He's died!

666
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,595
l want his only daughter to look upon me...

667
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,958
...as her own dad, in a very real,
and legally binding sense.

668
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:06,236
And l feel sure that the merger....
The union between the Princess...

669
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,469
...and the brave but dangerous
Sir Lancelot of Camelot--

670
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,878
-What?
-Look, the dead Prince!

671
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,836
-He's not quite dead!
-l feel much better.

672
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,673
You fell out of the tall tower, you creep!

673
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,589
-No, l was saved at the last minute.
-How?

674
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,432
l'll tell you.

675
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,154
Not like that! Not like that.

676
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,710
''He's going tell
He's going to tell''

677
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,871
Quickly, sir, come this way!

678
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,669
No, it's not right for my idiom.
l must escape more....

679
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,552
-Dramatically, sir?
-Dramatically.

680
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,634
Excuse me,
could somebody give me a push, please?

681
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,632
Old crone!

682
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,550
ls there anywhere in this town
where we could buy a shrubbery?

683
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,716
-Who sent you?
-The knights who say, ''Ni''!

684
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,559
No! We have no shrubberies here.

685
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,599
lf you do not tell us where we can buy
a shrubbery, my friend and l...

686
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,154
...will say....

687
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,039
We will say, ''Ni.''

688
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,874
Do your worst!

689
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,919
Very well.
lf you will not assist us voluntarily...

690
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,595
-...Ni!
-No!

691
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,515
Never. No shrubberies.

692
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,480
-Ni!
-Noo!

693
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,516
No, it's not that, it's ''Ni.''

694
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,040
No, you're not doing it properly.

695
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,393
-Ni.
-You've got it.

696
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,550
-Ni!
-Ni!

697
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,598
Are you saying ''Ni'' to that old woman?

698
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,470
Yes.

699
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:18,588
What sad times are these when passing
ruffians can say, ''Ni'' at will to old ladies.

700
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,232
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.

701
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,189
Even those who arrange shrubberies
are under considerable economic stress...

702
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,191
...at this period in history.

703
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,874
-Did you say ''shrubberies''?
-Yes.

704
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,872
Shrubberies are my trade.
l am a shrubber.

705
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:38,351
My name is Roger the Shrubber.
l arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.

706
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,236
-Ni!
-No!

707
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,033
Knights of Ni,
we have brought you your shrubbery.

708
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,350
-May we go?
-lt is a good shrubbery.

709
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:51,712
l like the laurels particularly.
But there is one small problem.

710
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,309
What is that?

711
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,200
We are now no longer
the knights who say ''Ni.''

712
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,600
We are now the knights who say:

713
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,192
''Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing''!

714
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,800
Therefore, we must give you a test.

715
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,270
What's is this test,
knights who until recently said ''Ni''?

716
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,030
Firstly, you must find...

717
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,392
...another shrubbery!

718
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,875
Not another shrubbery!

719
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,555
Then you must bring it here
beside this shrubbery.

720
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,150
Higher, so you get the two-level effect,
a path going down the middle.

721
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,196
A path! A path!

722
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,272
Then, when you have found
the shrubberies...

723
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,791
...you must cut down
the mightiest tree in the forest...

724
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,557
...with a herring!

725
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,320
-We shall do no such thing.
-Please.

726
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,712
Cut down a tree with a herring?
lt can't be done.

727
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,197
-Don't say that word.
-What word?

728
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,191
l cannot tell. Suffice to say...

729
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,874
...it's one of the words
the knights of Ni cannot hear.

730
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,758
How can we not say the word
if you don't tell us what it is?

731
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,876
-He did it again.
-What? ''ls''?

732
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,714
You wouldn't get very far in life
not saying ''is.''

733
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,833
My liege, it's Robin.

734
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:09,152
''He's jacking it in and packing it up
And sneaking away and buggering up

735
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,677
''And chickening out and pissing a pot
Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge''

736
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,954
-Robin.
-My liege.

737
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,598
lt's good to see you.

738
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,148
You haven't given up your quest
for the Holy Grail?

739
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,595
-''He is sneaking away and--''
-Shut up!

740
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,469
-No, far from it.
-You said the word again.

741
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,951
l was looking for it here in this forest.

742
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,312
-No, it is far from this place.
-Stop saying the word!

743
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,755
-The word we cannot hear!
-Stop it!

744
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,876
-He said, ''it'' again!
-That's it!

745
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,838
l've said, ''it.'' l've said, ''it.''
l've said, ''it'' again!

746
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,036
That's three ''its''!

747
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,278
And so Arthur and Bedevere and
Sir Robin set out on their search to find...

748
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:57,114
...the enchanter of whom
the old man had spoken in Scene 24.

749
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,319
Beyond the forest
they met Lancelot and Galahad...

750
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,709
...and there was much rejoicing.

751
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,876
In the frozen land of Nador...

752
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,633
...they were forced to eat
Robin's minstrels.

753
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,794
And there was much rejoicing.

754
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,592
A year passed.

755
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,635
Winter changed into spring.

756
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,196
Spring changed into summer.

757
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,075
Summer changed back into winter...

758
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:42,393
...and winter gave spring and summer
a miss and went straight on into autumn.

759
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,909
Until one day.

760
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,196
Knights...

761
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,914
...forward!

762
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,834
What manner of man are you,
that can summon up fire...

763
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,550
-...without flint or tinder?
-l am an enchanter.

764
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,835
-By what name are you known?
-There are some who call me...

765
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,434
-...Tim.
-Greetings, Tim the enchanter!

766
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,795
Greetings, King Arthur.

767
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,192
-You know my name?
-l do.

768
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,514
You seek the Holy Grail.

769
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,078
That is our quest.
You know much that is hidden, Tim.

770
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,309
Quite.

771
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,549
Yes, we are looking for the Holy Grail.

772
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,554
-Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
-Yes, it is.

773
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,757
-And so we're looking for it.
-Yes, we are.

774
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,559
-We have been for some time.
-Ages.

775
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:52,312
So, anything you could do to help
would be...

776
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,749
...very...

777
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,673
-...helpful.
-Look, can you tell us where--

778
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,272
Fine, l don't want to waste
any more of your time...

779
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,114
...but l don't suppose you could tell us
where we might find a....

780
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,638
A what?

781
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,233
A grail?

782
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,390
Yes, l think so.

783
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,955
Yes.

784
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,149
Yes!

785
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,999
-Thank you.
-Splendid!

786
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,148
Look, you're a busy man--

787
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:39,711
Yes, l can help you find the Holy Grail.

788
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,716
To the north, there lies a cave.
The Cave of Caerbannog.

789
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,839
Wherein, carved in mystic runes,
upon the very living rock...

790
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,597
...the last words
of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...

791
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,395
...make plain the last resting place
of the most Holy Grail.

792
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,232
-Where could we find this cave, Tim?
-Follow!

793
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,559
But follow only if ye be men of valour.

794
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,276
For the entrance to this cave
is guarded by a creature...

795
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,877
...so foul, so cruel...

796
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:19,077
...that no man yet
has fought with it and lived.

797
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:27,231
Bones of full 50 men lie strewn
about its lair. So, brave knights...

798
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:33,350
...if you do doubt your courage
or your strength, come no further...

799
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,434
...for death awaits you all
with nasty, big, pointy teeth.

800
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,517
What an eccentric performance!

801
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,873
They're nervous, sire.

802
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,474
Then we'd best leave them here
and carry on, on foot.

803
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,551
Dismount!

804
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:17,434
Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!

805
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,752
-Right, keep me covered.
-What with?

806
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,755
-Just keep me covered.
-Too late.

807
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,155
There he is!

808
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,190
-Where?
-There.

809
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,112
-What, behind the rabbit?
-lt is the rabbit.

810
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,515
-You silly sod!
-What?

811
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,999
You got us all worked up.

812
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,718
That's no ordinary rabbit.

813
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,635
That's the most foul, cruel and
bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.

814
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,190
You tit! l soiled my armour
l was so scared!

815
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,676
Look, that rabbit's got
a vicious streak a mile wide.

816
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,671
-lt's a killer!
-Get stuffed.

817
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,990
-He'll do you up a treat, mate!
-Yeah?

818
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,514
-You manky Scots git!
-l'm warning you.

819
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,115
-What's he do? Nibble your bum?
-He's got huge, sharp....

820
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,792
lt can leap about....

821
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,516
-Look at the bones!
-Go on, Bors, chop its head off.

822
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,189
Right. Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew coming right up.

823
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,029
Look!

824
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,677
-Jesus Christ!
-l warned you!

825
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,751
-l've done it again.
-l warned you.

826
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:32,037
But did you listen to me?
No, you knew it all, didn't you?

827
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:36,557
lt's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?
Well, it's always the same.

828
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,154
-l always--
-Shut up!

829
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,312
Charge!

830
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,675
Run away!

831
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,636
-How many did we lose?
-Gawain.

832
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,676
-Ector.
-And Bors. That's five.

833
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,637
-Three.
-Three.

834
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,515
We better not risk another frontal assault,
that rabbit's dynamite.

835
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,114
Would it help to confuse it
if we run away more?

836
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,431
-Shut up and change your armour.
-Let us taunt it.

837
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,193
lt may become so cross,
that it will make a mistake.

838
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,349
Like what?

839
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,589
Well....

840
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,517
-Have we got bows?
-No.

841
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,875
-We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
-Yes, of course!

842
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,632
The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.

843
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,439
lt's one of the sacred relics
Brother Maynard carries.

844
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,478
Brother Maynard!
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.

845
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,908
How does it....

846
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,715
How does it work?

847
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,519
-l know not, my liege.
-Consult the Book of Armaments.

848
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,229
Armaments 2: 9-21.

849
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,194
''And St. Attila raised the hand grenade
up on high, saying:

850
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,839
'''O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade,
that with it thou mayest...

851
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,435
'''...blow thine enemies
to tiny bits, in thy mercy.'

852
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,038
''And the Lord did grin
and the people did feast upon...

853
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,114
''...the lambs and sloths and carp
and anchovies and orangutans...

854
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,709
''...and breakfast cereals
and fruit bats and--''

855
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,233
Skip a bit, Brother.

856
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:00,511
''The Lord spake, saying,
'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin...

857
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:05,154
'''...then shalt thou count to three,
no more, no less.

858
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,954
'''Three shalt be the number
thou shalt count...

859
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,918
'''...and the number
of the counting shalt be three.

860

'''Four shalt thou not count,
neither count thou two...

861

'''...excepting that thou then
proceed to three.

862
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,555
'''Five is right out.

863
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,036
'''Once the number three,

864
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,591
'''...then lobbest thou

866
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,478
'''...shall snuff it.'''

867
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,229
Amen.

868
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:39,429
Amen.

869
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,555
Right.

870
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,350
One, two, five!

871
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,237
-Three, sir!
-Three!

872
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,753
There! Look!

873
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,915
What does it say? What language is that?

874
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,150
Brother Maynard, you're our scholar.

875
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,799
lt is Aramaic!

876
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,873
Of course. Joseph of Arimathea!

877
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,191
-Of course.
-What does it say?

878
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,517
lt reads, ''Here may be found...

879
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,070
''...the last words of Joseph of Arimathea:

880
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,877
'''He who is valiant and pure of spirit...

881
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,756
'''...may find the Holy Grail...

882
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:01,198
'''...in the Castle of Aaargh.'''

883
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,155
What?

884
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,555
''The Castle of Aaargh.''

885
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,394
What is that?

886
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,036
He must have died while carving it.

887
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,839
-Come on!
-That's what it says.

888
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:19,396
Look, if he was dying,
he wouldn't bother to carve ''Aaargh.''

889
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,876
-He'd just say it.
-That's what's carved in the rock.

890
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,151
-Perhaps he was dictating it.
-Shut up!

891
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,435
-Does it say anything else?
-No!

892
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,637
Just ''Aaargh.''

893
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,829
Aaargh.

894
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,515
Do you suppose he meant the Camargue?

895
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,511
-Where's that?
-ln France, l think.

896
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:45,196
-lsn't there a St. Aaargh's in Cornwall?
-No, that's St. lves.

897
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,550
St. lves.

898
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,074
No, ''Aaargh.'' At the back of the throat.

899
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,152
No, in surprise and alarm!

900
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,039
-You mean a sort of a ''Ah!''
-Yes, that's right.

901
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,635
My God!

902
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:08,036
lt's the Legendary Black Beast of Aaargh!

903
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,953
That's it! Run away!

904
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,588
We've lost him.

905
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,959
As the horrendous Black Beast
lunged foreard...

906
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,313
...escape for Arthur
and his knights seemed hopeless.

907
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,234
When, suddenly, the animator
suffered a fatal heart attack.

908
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,028
The cartoon peril was no more.

909
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,553
The quest for the Holy Grail
could continue.

910
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,758
There it is!

911
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,039
-The Bridge of Death.
-Great.

912
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,033
Look! There's the old man from Scene 24.

913
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,715
-What's he doing here?
-He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.

914
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,430
He asks each traveller five questions.

915
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,397
-Three questions.
-Three questions.

916
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,916
-He who answers the five questions--
-Three questions.

917
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,278
-Three questions, may cross in safety.
-What if you get a question wrong?

918
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,716
Then you are cast
into the gorge of eternal peril.

919
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,997
-Oh, wacko.
-Who's going to answer the questions?

920
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,839
Brave Sir Robin, you go.

921
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,471
l've got a great idea:

922
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,559
Why doesn't Lancelot go?

923
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,279
Yes, let me go, my liege.
l will take him single-handed.

924
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,875
-l shall make a feint to the northeast....
-Hang on!

925
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,594
-Just answer the five questions--
-Three questions.

926
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:49,514
Three questions, as best you can.
And we shall watch and pray.

927
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,472
l understand, my liege.

928
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:55,190
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.

929
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,469
Stop!

930
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,437
Who would cross the Bridge of Death,
must answer me these questions three.

931
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,716
Ere the other side he see.

932
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,798
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
l'm not afraid.

933
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,794
-What is your name?
-My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

934
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,192
What is your quest?

935
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,396
To seek the Holy Grail.

936
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,916
What is your favourite colour?

937
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,510
-Blue.
-Right. Off you go.

938
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,751
Well, thank you very much.

939
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,189
That's easy.

940
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,109
Stop.

941
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:43,311
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death,
must answer me these questions three.

942
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,796
Ere the other side he see.

943
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,239
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
l'm not afraid.

944
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,790
-What is your name?
-Sir Robin of Camelot.

945
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,232
-What is your quest?
-To seek the Holy Grail.

946
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,596
What is the capital of Assyria?

947
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,548
l don't know that!

948
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,836
Stop!

949
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,270
-What is your name?
-Sir Galahad of Camelot.

950
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,751
-What is your quest?
-l seek the Grail.

951
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,592
-What is your favourite colour?
-Blue.

952
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,389
No! Yellow!

953
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,549
Stop!

954
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,679
-What is your name?
-lt is Arthur, King of the Britons.

955
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,595
-What is your quest?
-To seek the Holy Grail.

956
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,631
What is the air-speed velocity
of an unladen swallow?

957
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,113
What do you mean?
An African or European swallow?

958
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,553
l don't know that!

959
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,835
How do you know
so much about swallows?

960
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:02,520
You have to know these things
when you're a king.

961
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:41,749
Lancelot!

962
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,189
Lancelot!

963
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,708
Lancelot!

964
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,515
The Castle Aaargh. Our quest is at an end.

965
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,433
God be praised.

966
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,279
Almighty God...

967
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:16,069
...we thank thee, that thou hast vouchsafed
to us the most holy--

968
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:18,757
Jesus Christ!

969
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,800
Dirty English knights.

970
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,360
Monsieur Arthur King,
who has the brain of a duck.

971
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:29,716
So, we French fellows
outwit you a second time.

972
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,718
How dare you profane this place
with your presence?

973
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,549
l command you,
in the name of the knights of Camelot...

974
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,633
...to open the doors of this sacred castle...

975
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,150
...to which God himself has guided us.

976
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:48,360
How you English say?
l'll unclog my nose in your direction.

977
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,873
Sons of a window-dresser!

978
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,428
So, you think you could
out-clever us French folk...

979
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:55,910
...with your silly knees-bent,
running about, advancing behaviour.

980
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,673
l wave my private parts at your aunties.

981
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:03,351
You cheesy lot of second-hand,
electric donkey-bottom biters!

982
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,476
ln the name of the Lord...

983
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:09,155
...we demand entrance
to this sacred castle!

984
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,913
No chance, English bed-wetting types.

985
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,073
l burst my pimples at you, and call your
door-opening request a silly thing!

986
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:19,436
You tiny-brained wipers
of other people's bottoms.

987
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,035
lf you'll not open this door,
we shall take this castle by force!

988
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,035
ln the name of God and the glory of our--

989
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,234
Right! That settles it!

990
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,992
Depart at this time,
and don't be approaching any more...

991
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:39,596
...or we fire arrows into your heads,
and make castanets out of your testicles.

992
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,238
Walk away, just ignore them.

993
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:45,074
And now remain gone,
illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!

994
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:49,671
And, if you think you got a nasty
taunting this time, you ain't heard...

995
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,150
...nothing yet, dirty English knights!

996
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,078
-We shall attack at once.
-Yes, my liege.

997
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,037
Stand by for attack!

998
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,593
French persons!

999
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:22,109
Today the blood of many a valiant knight
shall be avenged.

1000
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,837
ln the name of God,
we shall not stop our fight...

1001
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:30,511
...till each one of you lies dead,
and the Holy Grail...

1002
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:34,076
...returns to those whom God has chosen.

1003
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:38,358
Charge!

1004
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,269
Yes, they're the ones, l'm sure.

1005
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,228
-Come on.
-Put this man in the van.

1006
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,719
-Put him in the van.
-Get a blanket over that one.

1007
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:22,428
Come on, back! Right back!

1008
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,710
That's an offensive weapon, that is.

1009
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:31,870
All right, sonny, that's enough.
Pack that in.
