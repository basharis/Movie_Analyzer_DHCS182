1
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,129
You don't like flying, do you?

2
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:01,603
What gives you that idea?

3
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:04,640
You want to know the secret...

4
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:08,371
to surviving air travel?

5
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,571
After you get
where you're going,

6
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:11,206
take off your shoes and socks.

7
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:13,080
Then walk around,

8
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:15,847
making fists
with your toes.

9
00:01:15,954 --> 00:01:17,854
Fists with your toes?

10
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:20,858
It sounds crazy,

11
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,894
but I've been doing it
for nine years.

12
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:26,931
Better than a shower
and a cup of coffee.

13
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:29,558
Okay.

14
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:41,208
It's okay.
I'm a cop.

15
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:44,440
Trust me.

16
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:47,587
I've been doing this
for 11 years.

17
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:50,155
<i>On behalf of
the captain and crew,</i>

18
00:01:50,256 --> 00:01:53,123
<i>we'd like to welcome you
to Los Angeles.</i>

19
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,126
<i>Have a very Merry Christmas.</i>

20
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:13,912
<i>Flight 227 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.</i>

21
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:28,085
Ah.

22
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:31,597
How do you do?

23
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:43,943
Ladies and gentlemen.

24
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:45,945
Ladies and gentlemen!

25
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:49,949
I want to congratulate
each and every one of you...

26
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,952
for making this
one of the greatest years...

27
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:55,955
in the history
of the Nakatomi Corporation.

28
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:00,392
On behalf of
the chief executive officer,

29
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:03,396
Mr. Ozu,
and the board of directors,

30
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:05,898
we wish you
a Merry Christmas...

31
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:08,060
and a Happy New Year!

32
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,570
Merry Christmas!

33
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,401
Happy New Year!

34
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:12,906
Hey, Holly,

35
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,408
what about
dinner tonight, huh?

36
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,411
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

37
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:20,414
Families, stockings...

38
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:23,909
chestnuts...

39
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,419
Rudolph and Frosty.

40
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:28,422
Any of these things
ring a bell?

41
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:30,424
Actually, I was
thinking more...

42
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:33,427
of mulled wine,
a nice aged brie,

43
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:35,429
and a roaring fireplace.

44
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,431
You know what I'm saying?

45
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:41,436
Ginny, it's 5:40.

46
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:44,439
Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

47
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,442
You're making me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

48
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:50,445
Can the baby
handle a little sip?

49
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:52,947
That baby's ready
to tend bar.

50
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,075
Last chance.

51
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:56,277
Bye.

52
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,951
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.

53
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:07,554
Hello, Lucy McClane.

54
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,565
This is
your mother speaking.

55
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,066
Mommy!

56
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,069
When are you
coming home?

57
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,071
Pretty soon.
Pretty soon.

58
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:18,574
You'll be in bed
when I get there, though.

59
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,576
Let me talk to Paulina.

60
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,078
And no snooping
around the house,

61
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:24,614
looking for presents.

62
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:27,082
Is Daddy coming home
with you?

63
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:31,254
Well, we'll see what...

64
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:33,756
Santa and Mommy
can do, okay?

65
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,758
Put Paulina on.
Bye, honey.

66
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,452
Paulina!

67
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:44,560
<i>Hola, Mrs. Holly.</i>

68
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,434
Um, did Mr. McClane call?

69
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,441
<i>No, Mrs. Holly.
No telefono.</i>

70
00:04:50,543 --> 00:04:52,943
Well, he probably just
didn't have time...

71
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:54,444
before his flight.

72
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:57,277
Um, make up
the spare bedroom...

73
00:04:57,383 --> 00:04:58,782
just in case.

74
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:01,444
<i>Si, Mrs. Holly.
I do that already.</i>

75
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:04,387
What would I do
without you, Paulina?

76
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:25,910
Oh!

77
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:31,211
California.

78
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:45,431
Hey, I'm John McClane.

79
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,091
Argyle.

80
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:48,998
I'm your limo driver.

81
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,364
Nice bear.

82
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:59,445
Okay... Argyle.

83
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:02,015
What do we do now?

84
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:03,879
You tell me.

85
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:06,920
It's my first time
driving a limo.

86
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:10,014
This is my first time
riding in one.

87
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:13,059
Relax. We got everything
in this mug, man.

88
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:16,392
Look at this-
CD, CB, TV,

89
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:19,058
telephone, full bar, VHS.

90
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:22,900
If your friend's
hot to trot,

91
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:25,405
I know a few
mama bears.

92
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:27,407
Or is he married?

93
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:28,908
He's married.

94
00:06:29,011 --> 00:06:30,410
Okay.

95
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:32,412
Oh, sorry about that.

96
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:34,414
It's the girl's day off.

97
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:37,918
I didn't know
you were gonna sit up front.

98
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:40,921
So, uh, your lady
live out here?

99
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,924
About the past
six months.

100
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:45,927
Meaning you still
live in New York?

101
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:48,623
You always ask
this many questions, Argyle?

102
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:50,358
Sorry, man.
I used to drive a cab.

103
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:52,229
People would expect
a little chitchat.

104
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:53,666
So you divorced?

105
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,670
Just drive the car, man.

106
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:58,172
Come on.
You divorced?

107
00:06:58,274 --> 00:07:00,606
You separated?
She beat you up?

108
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:04,778
She had a good job.

109
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:06,781
It turned into
a great career.

110
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,785
<i>That meant
she had to move here.</i>

111
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,287
You're very fast, Argyle.

112
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:15,324
<i>So why didn't you come?</i>

113
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:18,554
<i>Well?</i>

114
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:20,186
What's up?

115
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:22,629
Because I'm
a New York cop.

116
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,134
I got a six-month backlog
of New York scumbags.

117
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:29,364
I can't just pick up
and go that easy.

118
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:32,465
You thought
she wouldn't make it out here,

119
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:34,976
so why bother
to pack, right?

120
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,981
Like I said,
you're very fast, Argyle.

121
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,109
You mind if we
hear some tunes?

122
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:47,722
Hey, that will work.

123
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:51,091
Don't you got
any Christmas music?

124
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:53,324
<i>This is Christmas music.</i>

125
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,330
<i># It was December 24th
on Hollis Ave. after dark #</i>

126
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,926
<i># When I seen a man chillin'
with his dog in the park #</i>

127
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:01,869
<i># I approached them
very slowly #</i>

128
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:03,736
<i># With my heart full of fear
looked at his dog #</i>

129
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:05,503
<i># Oh, my God,
a ill reindeer#</i>

130
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,601
<i># But then I was illin'
'cause the man had a beard #</i>

131
00:08:07,712 --> 00:08:10,181
<i># And a bag full of goodies
12:00 hit, man #</i>

132
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,579
<i># So I turned my head a second #</i>

133
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:13,083
<i># And the man was gone #</i>

134
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:14,243
<i># But he must have
dropped his wallet #</i>

135
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:15,911
<i># Smack dead on the lawn #</i>

136
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:17,921
<i># I picked the wallet up,
and then I took a pause #</i>

137
00:08:18,023 --> 00:08:20,287
<i># Took out the
license and it cold said "Santa Claus"#</i>

138
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:22,952
<i># A million dollars in it
cold hundreds of G's ##</i>

139
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:26,463
So your lady sees you,
the music comes up,

140
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:29,466
and you live happily
ever after, right?

141
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:31,468
I can live with that.

142
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,974
If it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?

143
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:37,976
I'll find a place.

144
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:39,409
Tell you what.

145
00:08:39,513 --> 00:08:41,811
I'll wait
in the parking garage.

146
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:44,406
You score, you call
on the car phone.

147
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:47,646
You strike out,
I'll get you a hotel.

148
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:49,779
You're all right, Argyle.

149
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,951
Just remember that
when you sign for the tip.

150
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:18,112
Hi.

151
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:19,618
Good evening.

152
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,120
I'm here to see
Holly McClane.

153
00:09:22,223 --> 00:09:24,123
Just type it in there.

154
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,425
Cute toy.

155
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:34,831
If you have to
take a leak,

156
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:36,802
it finds
your zipper.

157
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:52,313
Christ.

158
00:09:57,426 --> 00:09:59,326
30th floor.

159
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:00,793
The party.

160
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:03,660
They're the only ones
left in the building.

161
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:05,164
Take the express elevator...

162
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,168
until you hear the noise.

163
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:08,669
Thanks.

164
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:06,828
Champagne, sir?

165
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,331
Yeah, thanks.

166
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:45,497
Oh, I'm sorry.

167
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:48,334
Hey, Merry Christmas!

168
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,510
Jesus.

169
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,012
Fuckin' California.

170
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,442
Why don't
I talk to him right now?

171
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,611
Hi.

172
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,949
I'm looking for-

173
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,283
Holly Gennero.

174
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,482
Yeah.

175
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,457
You must be
John McClane.

176
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,960
Joe Takagi.

177
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,962
How was your ride in?

178
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,964
I have you to thank?

179
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,466
Seemed the least
we could do.

180
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,969
Quite a place
you have here.

181
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,470
It will be.

182
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:20,972
Several floors are
under construction.

183
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,474
Holly went to fax
some documents.

184
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,976
In the meanwhile,

185
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,978
her office is
right back here.

186
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,213
<i>Ellis.</i>

187
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:35,085
I was just making a call.

188
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:38,852
I want you to meet
John McClane,

189
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,325
Holly's husband-

190
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:41,656
Holly's policeman.

191
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:44,493
Ellis is in charge of
international development.

192
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:47,500
Heard a heck of a lot
about you.

193
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:49,536
Missed some.

194
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,838
Can I get you anything?

195
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,339
Food? Cake?

196
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,342
Some watered-down
champagne?

197
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:58,503
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

198
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,946
You throw quite a party.

199
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,447
I didn't realize...

200
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,780
they celebrated
Christmas in Japan.

201
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:06,787
Pearl Harbor
didn't work out,

202
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:10,950
so we got you
with tape decks.

203
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,291
Actually, it's sort of
a double celebration.

204
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:18,093
Holly helped us close
a big deal today.

205
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,465
<i>I'll be out in
a couple of minutes.</i>

206
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:26,975
John.

207
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:32,469
Have you met everyone?

208
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,981
We've been
sticking him with spears.

209
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:36,985
Of course, he has.

210
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:39,487
She was made
for the business.

211
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:40,988
Tough as nails.

212
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:42,490
I was hoping...

213
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:43,991
you made that flight.

214
00:13:44,094 --> 00:13:45,994
Show him the watch.

215
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:47,154
Later.

216
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:48,662
Go on.
Show him.

217
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:50,130
What, are you
embarrassed?

218
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:53,293
<i>A token of appreciation
for her hard work.</i>

219
00:13:53,403 --> 00:13:54,995
It's a Rolex.

220
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:57,505
I'm sure
I'll see it later.

221
00:13:57,607 --> 00:14:00,735
Is there a place
where I could wash up?

222
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:03,278
Sure.

223
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:19,993
Ellis gets very depressed...

224
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:21,655
this time of year.

225
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:24,632
He thought he was
God's greatest gift.

226
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:26,635
Yeah.
I know the type.

227
00:14:26,737 --> 00:14:30,138
Think he's got
his eye on you.

228
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:31,640
That's okay...

229
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:33,141
I have my eye...

230
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:34,644
on his private bathroom.

231
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:36,144
Where you staying?

232
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:38,148
Things happened so fast,

233
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,151
I didn't get
a chance to ask you.

234
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:43,983
Cappy Roberts
retired out here.

235
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:46,819
He told me
I could bunk with him.

236
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,655
Cappy retired, huh?
Where's he live?

237
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:50,921
Ramona.

238
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,122
Pomona.

239
00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:54,323
Huh?

240
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:55,490

241
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,794
Pomona.

242
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:58,836
Yeah.

243
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:01,770
You'll be in the car
half the time.

244
00:15:01,873 --> 00:15:03,272
Why don't we make it easy?

245
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,936
I have a spare bedroom.

246
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:08,741
It's not huge
or anything, but...

247
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:12,249
the kids would love
to have you at the house.

248
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,444
They would, huh?

249
00:15:17,557 --> 00:15:19,286
I would, too.

250
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:23,119
Ooh!

251
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:25,163
Sorry.

252
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:33,471
I missed you.

253
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:43,278
I guess you didn't
miss my name, though, huh?

254
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:47,319
Except maybe when
you're signing checks?

255
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:49,446
Since when are you
" Ms. Gennero"?

256
00:15:52,092 --> 00:15:53,992
This is
a Japanese company.

258
00:15:58,298 --> 00:16:01,131
- You're married to me. - Are we going
to have this conversation again?

259
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:03,431
<i>- We never finished this conversation
in July. - I had an opportunity-</i>

260
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:05,836
- I had to take it.
- Right, no matter what the consequences.

261
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:08,738
- No matter what it did to our marriage.
- It didn't do anything...

262
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,004
except change your idea
of what our marriage should be.

263
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:14,104
- You don't have a clue what my idea of our
marriage should be. - I know exactly...

264
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:16,581
what your idea
of our marriage should be.

265
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,447
Ms. Gennero, I-

266
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:21,882
Excuse me.

267
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,753
Hi.

268
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,191
Um, Mr. Takagi

Be back in

272
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:52,485
That was great, John.

273
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:53,987
Good job.

274
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,647
Very mature.

275
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:47,309
So Kareem rebounds, right?

276
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:49,311
Feeds Worthy on the break,

277
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,745
over to A.C., to Magic,
then back to Worthy, right?

278
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:54,310
Boom!

00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,778
Sit... down!

364
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:27,329
Mr. Takagi,
I'm really not interested...

365
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:28,958
in your computer.

366
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:35,474
But I need the code key...

367
00:29:35,576 --> 00:29:39,478
<i>because I am interested
in the $640 million...</i>

368
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,480
in negotiable bearer bonds...

369
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:44,483
that you have
locked in your vault.

370
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:48,749
And the computer
controls the vault.

371
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:50,983
You want money?

372
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:54,755
What kind
of terrorists are you?

373
00:29:57,098 --> 00:30:00,500
Who said
we were terrorists?

374
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:23,957
<i>The bonds represent
at most ten days'...</i>

375
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,527
<i>operating capital
for your parent organization.</i>

376
00:30:35,238 --> 00:30:37,365
The code, please.

377
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:39,235
It's useless to you.

378
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:43,301
There are seven vault safeguards,
and the code key's only one of them.

379
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:45,243
You'll never get it open.

380
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:48,249
Then there's no reason
not to tell us.

381
00:30:48,351 --> 00:30:49,545
I told you.

382
00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:51,745
It's not over yet.

383
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,259
It's a very nice suit...

384
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:00,353
Mr. Takagi.

385
00:31:00,464 --> 00:31:03,194
It would be a shame
to ruin it.

386
00:31:06,303 --> 00:31:08,931
I'm going to
count to three.

387
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,008
<i>There will not be a four.</i>

388
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:13,736
Give me...

389
00:31:13,844 --> 00:31:16,711
the code.

390
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:18,212
One...

391
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:22,251
<i>Two...</i>

392
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:26,346
- Three.
- I don't know it. I'm telling you!

393
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:28,048
Get on the jet to Tokyo
and ask the chairman.

394
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:30,992
I'm telling you.
You're just gonna have to kill me.

395
00:31:31,095 --> 00:31:32,289
Okay.

396
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:37,832
We'll do it
the hard way.

397
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:39,927
Tony, see if you
can dispose of that.

398
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:43,303
Karl, better check
on Heinrich's work.

399
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,657
Nothing.

400
00:32:09,768 --> 00:32:11,633
See to Heinrich.

401
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:14,638
Now...

402
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,641
you can
break the code?

403
00:32:17,743 --> 00:32:19,643
You didn't
bring me along...

404
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:21,645
for my charming
personality.

405
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:31,156
Argyle, tell me
you heard the shots.

406
00:32:31,258 --> 00:32:32,987
You're callin'
the police right now.

407
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,152
Of course
I'm coming by later.

408
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:38,663
Have I ever lied to you?

409
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:42,098
My boss?
Thinks I'm on my way to Vegas.

410
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:45,660
Uli, get up on the pipes.

411
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:48,673
Marco, you go
through here.

412
00:32:48,775 --> 00:32:51,676
I'll throw you the cord.

413
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:57,978
Hans, we're on the roof.

414
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,624
Here.

415
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:27,144
Thirty minutes
to break the code,

416
00:33:27,248 --> 00:33:30,150
Two hours, two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals...

417
00:33:30,252 --> 00:33:31,651
at the minimum.

418
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:35,154
The seventh lock,
however, is out of my hands.

419
00:33:57,714 --> 00:33:59,181
I'm sorry-

420
00:33:59,282 --> 00:34:01,614
The seventh lock-
the electromagnetic seal.

421
00:34:01,718 --> 00:34:03,083
You do understand...

422
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:05,017
the circuits cannot
be cut locally.

423
00:34:06,723 --> 00:34:08,816
Trust me.

424
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:12,188
Why the fuck
didn't you stop him, John?

425
00:34:13,796 --> 00:34:16,697
'Cause then
you'd be dead, too, asshole!

426
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,699
Think, goddamn it!
Think!

427
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:33,112
We've got a fire alarm.

428
00:34:33,217 --> 00:34:34,707
Call 911.

429
00:34:34,818 --> 00:34:38,720
Give them the guard's name
and the building code number,

430
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:40,881
and cancel the alarm.

431
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,720
Then disable the system.

432
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:47,126
On what floor
did the alarm go off?

433
00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:51,232
Now, shall we go?

434
00:34:51,335 --> 00:34:52,734
<i>Nein.</i>

435
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:06,182
Oh, baby, come to Papa.

436
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:07,683
Come on.

437
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:16,085
Come on, baby.
Come to Papa.

438
00:35:16,194 --> 00:35:18,185
<i>I'll kiss
your fuckin'dalmatian.</i>

439
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:23,096
You stupid motherfuckers!
No!

440
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:26,568
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

441
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:03,173
The fire has been
called off, my friend.

442
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:09,680
No one is coming to help you.

443
00:36:13,286 --> 00:36:16,915
You might as well
come out and join the others.

444
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:21,692
I promise
I won't hurt you.

445
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,222
Drop it, dickhead.
It's the police.

446
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:55,227
You won't hurt me.

447
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:56,729
Yeah? Why not?

448
00:36:56,832 --> 00:36:59,232
Because
you're a policeman.

449
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:01,666
There are rules
for policemen.

450
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:06,139
Yeah. That's what
my captain keeps telling me.

451
00:37:32,302 --> 00:37:33,701
Aah!

452
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:14,969
You bet your ass
I wish to proceed.

453
00:38:55,487 --> 00:38:57,149
Nine million terrorists
in the world,

454
00:38:57,256 --> 00:39:00,487
and I got to kill one
with feet smaller than my sister.

455
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:52,042
I wanted this
to be professional,

456
00:39:52,145 --> 00:39:54,613
efficient, and cooperative.

457
00:39:54,715 --> 00:39:56,843
Not a lot to ask.

458
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:59,852
Alas, Mr. Takagi
did not see it that way,

459
00:39:59,954 --> 00:40:04,857
so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.

460
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:07,860
<i>We can go
any way you want it.</i>

461
00:40:07,962 --> 00:40:10,726
<i>You can walk out
or be carried out,</i>

462
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:14,996
but have no illusions-
we are in charge.

463
00:40:15,103 --> 00:40:20,507
<i>So... decide now, each of you,</i>

464
00:40:20,608 --> 00:40:22,269
<i>And please remember...</i>

465
00:40:23,945 --> 00:40:26,005
<i>we have left nothing
to chance.</i>

466
00:40:34,123 --> 00:40:35,681
Get them back!

467
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:47,830
" Now I have
a machine gun.

468
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:52,766
<i>Ho-ho-ho. "</i>

469
00:40:55,645 --> 00:40:57,545
A security guard
we missed?

470
00:40:57,647 --> 00:41:00,480
They're usually
just growing fat on a pension.

471
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,983
This is
something else.

472
00:41:11,995 --> 00:41:14,486
We have to do
something, Hans.

473
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,121
Yes, we do.

474
00:41:16,232 --> 00:41:18,757
Tell Karl his brother is dead.

475
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:20,733
Tell him
to come down.

476
00:41:20,837 --> 00:41:23,328
<i>Karl...
komm sofort.</i>

477
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:29,003
<i>Franco, you and Fritz take
the body upstairs and out of sight.</i>

478
00:41:29,113 --> 00:41:31,172
<i>I don't want the hostages
to think too much.</i>

479
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:35,480
Aah!

480
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:37,310
I want blood!

481
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:40,010
But let Heinrich
plant the detonators.

482
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:43,020
The police will waste hours
trying to negotiate.

483
00:42:43,122 --> 00:42:46,023
Then you can
tear the building apart.

484
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:49,356
But until then,
do not alter the plan.

485
00:42:49,462 --> 00:42:51,987
And if he alters it?

486
00:42:56,136 --> 00:42:58,229
What do you think?

487
00:43:00,574 --> 00:43:02,474
Something's wrong.

488
00:43:02,576 --> 00:43:03,975
Cops?

489
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:06,978
John.

490
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,345
<i>John-Aw, Christ!
He can fuck this whole thing up!</i>

491
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,441
<i>What does
he think he's doing?</i>

492
00:43:12,552 --> 00:43:13,849
His job.

493
00:43:13,954 --> 00:43:16,354
Bullshit. His job's
3,000 miles away.

494
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:20,859
Without him, we might
be able to get out of here.

495
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:24,363
Tell that to Takagi.

496
00:43:47,488 --> 00:43:50,218
Mayday. Mayday,
Anyone copying channel nine.

497
00:43:50,325 --> 00:43:52,725
Terrorists have seized
the Nakatomi Building...

498
00:43:52,827 --> 00:43:54,318
<i>and are holding
30 hostages.</i>

499
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,523
<i>Unknown number
of terrorists-</i>

500
00:43:56,632 --> 00:43:59,931
Six or more armed
with automatic weapons.

501
00:44:00,035 --> 00:44:03,232
Where's the best place
to transmit?

502
00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:04,670
<i>- Somebody answer me, goddamn it!
- The roof!</i>

503
00:44:04,773 --> 00:44:06,240
<i>Go! Go!</i>

504
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:11,245
<i>It's the same
address as that fire signal.</i>

505
00:44:11,347 --> 00:44:12,746
I'll handle it.

506
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,750
Attention,
whoever you are,

507
00:44:16,852 --> 00:44:19,252
this channel
is reserved for emergencies.

508
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:20,822
No shit, lady!

509
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:22,823
I'm not ordering
a pizza!

510
00:44:34,504 --> 00:44:37,268
No one kills him
but me.

511
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:41,276
They have
killed one hostage.

512
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:43,107
They are fortifying
their positions...

513
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:44,680
while you're jerking
me off on the radio!

514
00:44:44,781 --> 00:44:46,772
Sir, I've
already told you.

515
00:44:46,883 --> 00:44:48,783
This is
a reserved channel.

516
00:44:48,885 --> 00:44:52,286
If this is
an emergency call, dial 911.

517
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:56,349
Otherwise, I'll report
this as an FCC violation.

518
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,453
Fine! Come and arrest me,
just send the police now!

519
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,431
Ow!

520
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:18,677
See if there's a
black-and-white to do a drive-by.

521
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,192
Thought you guys
just ate doughnuts.

522
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:33,821
They're for my wife.

523
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,866
Yeah.

524
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:37,798
She's pregnant.

525
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:39,427
Yeah.

526
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:42,302
Bag it.

527
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,307
Big time.

528
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,377
Thanks.

529
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:53,884
Dispatch
to 8-Lincoln-30. Over.

530
00:45:53,986 --> 00:45:56,386
This is 8-Lincoln-30.
Come on in. Over.

531
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:57,888
Investigate a Code 2...

532
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,890
at Nakatomi Plaza,
Century City.

533
00:45:59,992 --> 00:46:03,324
8- Lincoln-30 to dispatch.
I'm on my way.

534
00:48:01,918 --> 00:48:03,317
Girls.

535
00:48:18,935 --> 00:48:22,736
Shit! Where the fuck?

536
00:48:43,461 --> 00:48:44,860
Oh, my God.

537
00:49:00,912 --> 00:49:02,812
He's in the elevator shaft.

538
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:06,814
Perfect.
The elevators are locked off.

539
00:49:06,918 --> 00:49:09,682
Just shut him in
and come back down.

540
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:14,824
Oh, fuck.

541
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:23,098
Karl, the police
are probably...

542
00:49:23,202 --> 00:49:25,067
on their way already.

543
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:47,357
Christ.

544
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:54,931
I can stall them but not
if they hear gunshots.

545
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:57,503
If you lock him in,
he'll be neutralized-

546
00:51:01,404 --> 00:51:04,066
Come out to the coast!

547
00:51:04,173 --> 00:51:06,300
We'll get together,
have a few laughs.

548
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:17,012
Now I know
what a TV dinner feels like.

549
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:28,296
<i>Such!</i>

550
00:52:23,956 --> 00:52:26,117
<i>Karl, komm!
Die polizei!</i>

551
00:52:26,225 --> 00:52:27,852
<i>Die polizei!</i>

552
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:14,071
Well, it's about time.

553
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,080
No signs
of disturbance, dispatch.

554
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:23,979
Possible crank call.

555
00:53:24,084 --> 00:53:26,075
<i>Check the area
and confirm.</i>

556
00:53:32,026 --> 00:53:34,824
Who's driving this car?
Stevie Wonder?

557
00:53:36,597 --> 00:53:38,690
I see a guard inside.

558
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:41,597
<i>I'm going in
for a closer look.</i>

559
00:53:41,702 --> 00:53:43,101
<i>Use caution.</i>

560
00:53:46,206 --> 00:53:47,503
Eddie?

561
00:53:47,608 --> 00:53:50,100
I had a feelin'
you'd be callin'.

562
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:16,194
Evenin', Officer.
What can I do for you?

563
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,615
Heh heh heh!

564
00:54:27,717 --> 00:54:30,584
We had
that false alarm, you know.

565
00:54:30,686 --> 00:54:32,586
That computer
sent you out...

566
00:54:32,688 --> 00:54:34,588
on another
wild-goose chase.

567
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,089
They been chasing bugs...

568
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:38,092
since they installed
this system.

569
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:40,094
<i>Notre Dame
on top of USC-</i>

570
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:41,663
Ah, shit!

571
00:54:41,764 --> 00:54:44,324
I got 50 bucks bet
on them assholes.

572
00:54:46,002 --> 00:54:50,064
<i>Come on, come on.
Where's the fucking cavalry?</i>

573
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:57,339
Ah!

574
00:55:11,662 --> 00:55:13,254
Bah!

575
00:55:13,363 --> 00:55:15,388
<i>...was good for 52 yards.</i>

576
00:55:15,499 --> 00:55:17,399
Mind if I look around?

577
00:55:17,501 --> 00:55:19,402
Help yourself.

578
00:55:19,504 --> 00:55:21,904
<i>Seven seconds left
in this period.</i>

579
00:55:22,006 --> 00:55:25,442
<i>Seven to nothing,
Notre Dame.</i>

580
00:55:29,047 --> 00:55:30,912
Freeze, Motherfucker!

581
00:55:31,015 --> 00:55:32,346
Don't shoot!

582
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:33,781
Drop it!

583
00:55:33,885 --> 00:55:35,284
Okay! Don't shoot!

584
00:55:35,386 --> 00:55:36,410
Drop it!

585
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:38,045
Ah!

586
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:55,939
Ah, the hell with this!

587
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,234
Ah!

588
00:56:02,748 --> 00:56:04,716
Ah!

589
00:56:04,817 --> 00:56:07,377
You are dog now!

590
00:56:07,486 --> 00:56:10,512
No more table!
Where are you going, pal?

591
00:56:10,622 --> 00:56:13,216
Next time
you have a chance...

592
00:56:13,325 --> 00:56:14,849
to kill someone,

593
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,121
don't hesitate.

594
00:56:22,402 --> 00:56:24,267
Thanks for the advice.

595
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,270
Sorry to waste your time.

596
00:56:26,372 --> 00:56:27,771
No problem.

597
00:56:27,874 --> 00:56:29,307
Merry Christmas.

598
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:30,706
Merry Christmas.

599
00:56:36,249 --> 00:56:40,151
# Oh, the weather outside
is frightful #

600
00:56:40,253 --> 00:56:42,585
# Dum de dum delightful #

601
00:56:45,258 --> 00:56:47,021
For the love-

602
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,528
8- Lincoln-30
to dispatch.

603
00:56:51,632 --> 00:56:53,031
Go ahead.

604
00:56:53,134 --> 00:56:55,034
That's a wild-goose chase...

605
00:56:55,136 --> 00:56:56,535
here at Nakatomi Plaza.

606
00:56:56,637 --> 00:56:58,537
Everything here's okay.
Over.

607
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:02,131
# But nobody has no place to go #

608
00:57:02,243 --> 00:57:05,906
# Let it snow, let it snow ##

609
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:09,442
Goddamn it!
Jesus H. Christ!

610
00:57:17,224 --> 00:57:19,318
Welcome
to the party, pal!

611
00:57:19,427 --> 00:57:21,122
Goddamn it!

612
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:25,998
<i># Turn up the heat #</i>

613
00:57:26,101 --> 00:57:27,659
<i># It's getting ready
to pop ##</i>

614
00:57:27,769 --> 00:57:32,365
Police under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

615
00:57:32,474 --> 00:57:34,465
I need back-up assistance now!

616
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,067
Now, Goddamn it! Now!

617
00:57:55,665 --> 00:57:58,361
Monica,
I can get us a table.

618
00:57:58,467 --> 00:58:01,300
Wolfgang and I
are very close friends.

619
00:58:01,404 --> 00:58:03,804
I interviewed him,
for God's sake.

620
00:58:03,906 --> 00:58:05,305
<i>...Nakatomi.</i>

621
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:07,308
<i>Repeat.
Officer needs assistance at-</i>

622
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:11,813
<i>I'm at Nakatomi Plaza. They're
turning my car into Swiss cheese!</i>

623
00:58:11,914 --> 00:58:13,814
<i>I need
back-up assistance now!</i>

624
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:15,975
<i>Now, Goddamn it! Now!</i>

625
00:58:35,939 --> 00:58:38,999
Never thought I'd love
to hear that sound.

626
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:41,077
All of you relax.

627
00:58:41,178 --> 00:58:44,079
This is a matter
of inconvenient timing.

628
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:46,081
Police action was inevitable...

629
00:58:46,183 --> 00:58:48,584
and, as it happens,
necessary.

630
00:58:48,686 --> 00:58:51,587
Let them fumble about outside,
and stay calm.

631
00:58:51,689 --> 00:58:53,350
This is simply the beginning.

632
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:58,925
I thought I told all of you
I want radio silence.

633
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,624
I didn't get
that message, Hans.

634
00:59:01,733 --> 00:59:05,100
You should have put it
on the bulletin board.

635
00:59:05,203 --> 00:59:08,502
Since I waxed Tony and Marco
and his friend,

636
00:59:08,606 --> 00:59:12,736
I figured you and Karl
and Franco might be lonely.

637
00:59:12,844 --> 00:59:15,506
How does he know
so much-

638
00:59:15,613 --> 00:59:18,981
That's very kind of you.

639
00:59:19,084 --> 00:59:21,985
I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.

640
00:59:22,087 --> 00:59:26,285
You are most troublesome
for a security guard.

641
00:59:26,392 --> 00:59:29,190
Eeeh! Sorry, Hans.
Wrong guess.

642
00:59:29,295 --> 00:59:31,957
Want to go
for Double Jeopardy,

643
00:59:32,064 --> 00:59:34,532
where the scores
can really change?

644
00:59:36,635 --> 00:59:39,468
Mm, these are
very bad for you.

645
00:59:39,571 --> 00:59:41,937
Who are you, then?

646
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:44,532
The fly in
the ointment, Hans.

647
00:59:44,643 --> 00:59:46,543
The monkey
in the wrench,

648
00:59:46,645 --> 00:59:48,546
the pain in the ass.

649
00:59:50,016 --> 00:59:51,540
Whoa!

650
00:59:52,953 --> 00:59:55,387
Don't use the radio.

651
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:59,549
See if he's lying about Marco.
Find out who's missing.

652
01:00:03,296 --> 01:00:05,321
Mr. Mystery Guest,

653
01:00:05,432 --> 01:00:07,832
are you still there?

654
01:00:07,934 --> 01:00:09,834
Yeah, I'm still here,

655
01:00:09,936 --> 01:00:13,838
unless you want to open
the front door for me.

656
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,407
I'm afraid not,

657
01:00:15,508 --> 01:00:17,409
but you have me
at a loss.

658
01:00:17,511 --> 01:00:20,105
You know my name,
but who are you?

659
01:00:20,214 --> 01:00:22,045
Just another American...

660
01:00:22,149 --> 01:00:24,845
who saw too many movies
as a child?

661
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:27,386
Another orphan
of a bankrupt culture...

662
01:00:27,488 --> 01:00:30,787
who thinks he's
John Wayne, Rambo,

663
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:32,358
Marshal Dillon?

664
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,361
I was always partial
to Roy Rogers, actually.

665
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:37,454
I liked those
sequined shirts.

666
01:00:37,565 --> 01:00:40,625
Do you think you have
a chance, Mr. Cowboy?

667
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:46,162
Yippee-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

668
01:00:49,845 --> 01:00:52,211
I can get the jump
on everybody...

669
01:00:52,314 --> 01:00:53,975
with a remote.

670
01:00:54,082 --> 01:00:56,073
Harvey,
keep your pants on.

671
01:00:56,184 --> 01:00:58,084
Sam, I'm begging you.

672
01:00:58,186 --> 01:01:00,518
Simon's already out
with the remote.

673
01:01:00,622 --> 01:01:04,524
I'm not sitting on this!
I am going out there!

674
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:07,026
You don't give me a truck,

675
01:01:07,129 --> 01:01:09,029
I'll steal a truck.

676
01:01:09,131 --> 01:01:11,497
Give us a break,
Thornburg.

677
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,760
Eat it, Harvey!

678
01:01:12,868 --> 01:01:15,200
Four, three, two...

679
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:16,828
one.

680
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:18,839
<i>Harvey, we're
on the air.</i>

681
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:24,974
Good evening.
This is Harvey Johnson.

682
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:28,943
And I'm Gail Wallens,

683
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,577
<i>and this is
Nightline News at 10:00.</i>

684
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:34,588
<i>Our top stories
on this Christmas eve-</i>

685
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,591
Take truck number five.
Get out of here.

686
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:46,026
He wasn't lying
about Marco.

687
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,195
He's down
on the street.

688
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:50,466
<i>The other man
was Heinrich,</i>

689
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:53,065
and his bag
is missing.

690
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:55,975
He had the detonator.

691
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:01,850
Theo.

692
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:02,976
Theo.

693
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:04,315
Yo!

694
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:06,321
We may have
some problems.

695
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:08,323
How's your schedule?

696
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:10,325
Three down.
Four to go.

697
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:13,328
Then don't waste time
talking to me.

698
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:16,332
This is sergeant Al Powell
of the L.A.P.D.

699
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:19,597
If the person
who radioed can hear me,

700
01:02:19,704 --> 01:02:22,070
acknowledge
this transmission.

701
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:24,004
I say again-

702
01:02:24,109 --> 01:02:27,340
If the person who radioed
can hear me,

703
01:02:27,445 --> 01:02:29,845
acknowledge
this transmission!

704
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:36,909
I read you.
You the guy in the car?

705
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:38,921
What's left of him.

706
01:02:39,023 --> 01:02:40,957
Can you identify
yourself?

707
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:42,959
Not now.
Maybe later.

708
01:02:43,061 --> 01:02:44,961
This is a party line.

709
01:02:45,063 --> 01:02:47,464
The neighbor's got
itchy trigger fingers.

710
01:02:47,566 --> 01:02:50,194
You got 30 hostages
on the 30th floor.

711
01:02:50,302 --> 01:02:53,794
<i>- The leader's name is Hans.
- We have to find him and shut him up.</i>

712
01:02:53,906 --> 01:02:55,806
- He's telling them everything!
- Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.

713
01:02:55,908 --> 01:02:58,138
Until then, he can waste
as much time as he likes,

714
01:02:58,244 --> 01:03:02,305
but we must find
the bag, Fritz.

715
01:03:02,414 --> 01:03:04,712
We must have
the detonators.

716
01:03:04,817 --> 01:03:06,808
<i>They got
missiles, automatic weapons,</i>

717
01:03:06,919 --> 01:03:09,410
<i>and enough explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

718
01:03:09,522 --> 01:03:11,820
They're down to nine now.

719
01:03:11,924 --> 01:03:14,324
These guys
are mostly European,

720
01:03:14,426 --> 01:03:16,827
judging by
their clothing labels and...

721
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:25,670
cigarettes.

722
01:03:25,772 --> 01:03:28,332
They're well-financed
and very slick.

723
01:03:28,441 --> 01:03:30,341
How do you
know that?

724
01:03:30,443 --> 01:03:31,933
I've seen
enough phony I.D.s...

725
01:03:32,045 --> 01:03:37,005
to recognize that the ones
they got must have cost a fortune.

726
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:38,516
Add all that up,

727
01:03:38,618 --> 01:03:40,449
I don't know
what the fuck it means,

728
01:03:40,554 --> 01:03:44,149
but you got some bad-ass
perpetrators here to stay.

729
01:03:44,257 --> 01:03:46,453
I hear you, partner.

730
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:48,791
L.A.'s finest are on it.

731
01:03:48,896 --> 01:03:51,387
Light 'em
if you got 'em.

732
01:03:51,499 --> 01:03:53,797
Way ahead of you, partner.

733
01:03:53,901 --> 01:03:57,302
So, what do I call you?

734
01:03:57,405 --> 01:03:59,305
Call me...

735
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:01,667
Roy.

736
01:04:01,776 --> 01:04:04,301
If you think of
anything else,

737
01:04:04,412 --> 01:04:06,312
don't you be shy, okay?

738
01:04:06,414 --> 01:04:09,815
In the meantime,
let us do our job.

739
01:04:09,917 --> 01:04:11,817
<i>They're all yours, Al.</i>

740
01:04:29,438 --> 01:04:31,906
All right,
who's talking to him?

741
01:04:32,007 --> 01:04:35,340
I am, sir. Sergeant Powell.
Al Powell.

742
01:04:35,444 --> 01:04:38,345
Dwayne Robinson, Powell.
What's the deal here?

743
01:04:38,447 --> 01:04:40,278
What do
these pricks want?

744
01:04:40,382 --> 01:04:42,282
Well, we don't exactly know.

745
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:44,284
We haven't heard from them.

746
01:04:44,386 --> 01:04:46,821
Who have you been talking to?

747
01:04:46,923 --> 01:04:50,450
We don't know.
He won't give us his name.

748
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,461
He appears to be
the one who phoned.

749
01:04:53,563 --> 01:04:55,292
He's killed
one terrorist,

750
01:04:55,398 --> 01:04:56,956
and he claims two others.

751
01:04:57,066 --> 01:04:59,967
Claims? Powell,
has it occurred to you...

752
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:02,867
he could be one
of the terrorists...

753
01:05:02,972 --> 01:05:04,963
<i>or some nutcase in there?</i>

754
01:05:05,074 --> 01:05:07,872
No. In fact,
I think he's a cop-

755
01:05:07,977 --> 01:05:10,810
Maybe not L.A.P.D.,
but he's a badge.

756
01:05:10,913 --> 01:05:11,845
Why?

757
01:05:11,948 --> 01:05:14,314
A hunch,
things he said,

758
01:05:14,417 --> 01:05:17,546
like being able
to spot a phony I.D.

759
01:05:17,655 --> 01:05:21,716
Jesus Christ, Powell. He could be
a fucking bartender for all we know!

760
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:23,816
TV's here.

761
01:05:23,927 --> 01:05:25,895
Oh, shit.

762
01:05:42,546 --> 01:05:44,343
I have a request.

763
01:05:44,448 --> 01:05:47,282
What idiot
put you in charge?

764
01:05:47,385 --> 01:05:48,852
You did...

765
01:05:48,953 --> 01:05:50,944
when you murdered
my boss.

766
01:05:51,056 --> 01:05:53,251
Now everybody's
looking to me.

767
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:55,792
Personally,
I'd pass on the job.

768
01:05:55,894 --> 01:05:59,193
I don't enjoy being
this close to you.

769
01:06:06,905 --> 01:06:08,634
Go on.

770
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,708
We have
a pregnant woman.

771
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:13,676
Relax. She's not due
for a couple weeks,

772
01:06:13,778 --> 01:06:16,077
but sitting on that rock isn't
doing her back any good.

773
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:20,346
So, I would like permission to move her
to one of the offices where there's a sofa.

774
01:06:20,453 --> 01:06:24,389
I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?

775
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,151
Good enough.

776
01:06:26,258 --> 01:06:28,192
Unless you
like it messy,

777
01:06:28,294 --> 01:06:30,592
start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.

778
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:33,722
Yes. You're right.

779
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:36,461
<i>It will be done.</i>

780
01:06:36,569 --> 01:06:38,127
<i>Was there
something else?</i>

781
01:06:40,373 --> 01:06:42,500
No, thank you.

782
01:06:48,382 --> 01:06:51,442
Mr. Takagi chose
his people well, Mrs...

783
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:53,280
Gennero.

784
01:06:55,222 --> 01:06:58,191
<i>Miss Gennero.</i>

785
01:07:00,127 --> 01:07:02,994
<i>We interrupt this program
for a special bulletin.</i>

786
01:07:03,096 --> 01:07:06,293
This is Richard Thornburg
live from Century City.

787
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,800
Tonight, Los Angeles
has joined...

788
01:07:08,902 --> 01:07:11,803
the sad and worldwide
fraternity of cities...

789
01:07:11,905 --> 01:07:13,805
whose only
membership requirement...

790
01:07:13,907 --> 01:07:17,309
<i>is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.</i>

791
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:19,312
<i>Approximately
two hours ago,</i>

792
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:21,314
<i>an unidentified
group of men...</i>

793
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,816
<i>seized control
of the Nakatomi Building,</i>

794
01:07:23,918 --> 01:07:26,318
<i>sealing off
all entrances and exits.</i>

795
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:29,185
<i>All telephone lines
have been cut,</i>

796
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:31,485
and the only communication
now possible...

797
01:07:31,592 --> 01:07:34,652
<i>has been through the use
of CB communicators,</i>

798
01:07:34,762 --> 01:07:36,992
<i>the group apparently
brought with them.</i>

799
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:39,089
<i>According to
official sources,</i>

800
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,532
<i>the perpetrators
of this building siege...</i>

801
01:07:41,636 --> 01:07:44,401
Unit Five, hold your position.

802
01:07:44,506 --> 01:07:46,770
<i>We got Charlie Unit
in position...</i>

803
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:48,502
<i>by the parking structure.</i>

804
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,441
Let me ask you something.

805
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:53,447
Does this stairway
go up to the escalator?

806
01:07:53,549 --> 01:07:54,777
Yeah.

807
01:07:54,883 --> 01:07:56,783
Tell them to go ahead.

808
01:07:56,885 --> 01:07:58,284
What's going on?

809
01:07:58,387 --> 01:08:01,288
What's it look like?
We're going in.

810
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,449
Going in?
Man, that's crazy!

811
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:06,289
There could be
over 30 hostages!

812
01:08:06,395 --> 01:08:08,295
We don't know shit,
Powell.

813
01:08:08,397 --> 01:08:11,298
How come there were
no ransom demands?

814
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,630
Where's their list
of demands?

815
01:08:13,735 --> 01:08:16,637
All we know is
somebody shot your car.

816
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:19,537
It's probably the same
son of a bitch...

817
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:21,473
<i>you've been
talking to on that radio.</i>

818
01:08:21,578 --> 01:08:23,307
Excuse me, sir.

819
01:08:23,413 --> 01:08:26,746
What about the body
that fell out the window?

820
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:29,318
Probably some stockbroker-
Got depressed.

821
01:08:29,419 --> 01:08:30,818
Let's go.

822
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,319
Hit your lights.

823
01:08:32,422 --> 01:08:33,821
<i>Let's go.</i>

824
01:08:33,923 --> 01:08:35,185
<i>Lights on!</i>

825
01:08:47,204 --> 01:08:49,104
Powell?

826
01:08:49,206 --> 01:08:52,232
You still with me, babe?
What's going on?

827
01:08:52,343 --> 01:08:54,311
Yo, Al.

828
01:08:54,411 --> 01:08:58,142
I'm kind of busy.
I'll talk to you later.

829
01:08:58,249 --> 01:08:59,773
Al, what's wrong?

830
01:08:59,884 --> 01:09:00,976
We'll talk later.

831
01:09:01,085 --> 01:09:04,054
If you are what
I think you are,

832
01:09:04,154 --> 01:09:06,952
you'll know when
to listen, shut up,

833
01:09:07,057 --> 01:09:09,150
and when to pray.

834
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,490
Jesus Christ!
You're coming in.

835
01:09:11,595 --> 01:09:15,032
<i>I told you what kind
of people they are.</i>

836
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:17,294
<i>Let's load them up.
Blue go.</i>

837
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:23,238
They'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

838
01:09:23,341 --> 01:09:26,310
Theo, you are
the eyes now.

839
01:09:39,324 --> 01:09:42,418
Rivers, begin
your reconnoiter.

840
01:09:48,401 --> 01:09:49,766
Shit!

841
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:12,280
Hey, come on, man.
Let's go.

842
01:10:21,401 --> 01:10:23,096
Ow!Jesus!

843
01:10:57,305 --> 01:10:59,273
All right, spread out.

844
01:11:25,634 --> 01:11:27,295
Shut up.

845
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:30,270
Let's go.

846
01:11:34,781 --> 01:11:37,306
You macho assholes.
No! No!

847
01:11:40,387 --> 01:11:43,152
Ahem... all right.
Listen up, guys.

848
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:46,716
'Twas the night
before Christmas,

849
01:11:46,828 --> 01:11:49,194
and all through the house,

850
01:11:49,297 --> 01:11:51,322
not a creature
was stirring, except...

851
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,367
the four assholes
coming in the rear...

852
01:11:54,469 --> 01:11:56,164
in standard
cover formation.

853
01:11:58,339 --> 01:11:59,931
We're all set.

854
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:01,906
We're ready.

855
01:12:03,344 --> 01:12:04,902
Kick ass.

856
01:12:05,013 --> 01:12:05,945
Go.

857
01:12:06,047 --> 01:12:07,947
Right.
Let's do it.

858
01:12:25,134 --> 01:12:27,034
They're shooting
at them.

859
01:12:27,136 --> 01:12:29,127
It's panic fire.
They can't see.

860
01:12:29,238 --> 01:12:31,001
They're shooting
at the lights.

861
01:12:35,077 --> 01:12:37,011
They're going
after the lights.

862
01:12:37,112 --> 01:12:38,909
<i>Pull them back.</i>

863
01:12:39,014 --> 01:12:40,914
It's not happening.

864
01:12:41,016 --> 01:12:42,484
Mike, burn it.

865
01:12:44,888 --> 01:12:46,515
Don't be impatient.

866
01:12:46,623 --> 01:12:49,353
Just wound them.

867
01:12:51,127 --> 01:12:53,095
They're sitting ducks
without lights.

868
01:12:53,196 --> 01:12:54,527
They're almost in.

869
01:12:54,631 --> 01:12:56,861
<i>Send in the car.</i>

870
01:12:56,967 --> 01:12:58,500
Send in the car.

871
01:13:11,881 --> 01:13:13,179
Jesus Christ!

872
01:13:16,454 --> 01:13:19,184
Rivers, Rodriguez,
report.

873
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:22,088
Whoa! Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

874
01:13:26,263 --> 01:13:28,788
The police
have themselves an RV.

875
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:35,398
Southeast corner.

876
01:13:47,419 --> 01:13:50,445
Oh, Jesus Christ.

877
01:14:00,999 --> 01:14:05,026
Get back!
Get the fuck back!

878
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:08,028
Get over there!

879
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,267
<i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>

880
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:13,470
<i>Mach schnell!</i>

881
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:15,945
<i>Weiter! Weiter!
Weiter!</i>

882
01:14:16,049 --> 01:14:18,108
<i>Mach schnell!
Mach schnell!</i>

883
01:14:18,217 --> 01:14:20,082
<i>Weiter!</i>

884
01:14:22,722 --> 01:14:24,986
<i>Mach los! Mach los!</i>

885
01:14:43,711 --> 01:14:45,144
I see him!

886
01:15:04,631 --> 01:15:07,532
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!

887
01:15:07,634 --> 01:15:10,626
Hang on, Rivers.
That's an order.

888
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:12,934
Hit it again.

889
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:16,272
Hans, you motherfucker! You made
your point! Let them pull back!

890
01:15:16,377 --> 01:15:21,105
Thank you, Mr. Cowboy. I'll take
it under advisement. Hit it again!

891
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,887
Fire.

892
01:15:50,613 --> 01:15:52,513
Fuck me.

893
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:55,083
Get them out of the car.

894
01:15:56,519 --> 01:15:58,578
- Aah!
- Aah!

895
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,957
Fuck it.

896
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,660
<i>Mach schnell!
Mach los!</i>

897
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:20,942
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerkweed.

898
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:27,643
Geronimo,
motherfucker.

899
01:16:46,504 --> 01:16:47,402
Shit!

900
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:54,344
They're using
artillery on us!

901
01:16:54,445 --> 01:16:56,913
You idiot,
it's not the police.

902
01:16:57,014 --> 01:16:58,743
It's him.

903
01:17:06,023 --> 01:17:07,513
Holy shit.

904
01:17:12,998 --> 01:17:14,590
My God.

905
01:17:16,034 --> 01:17:17,934
Tell me you got that.

906
01:17:18,036 --> 01:17:20,436
I got it.
I got it.

907
01:17:20,539 --> 01:17:23,406
Eat your heart out,
Channel Five.

908
01:17:23,508 --> 01:17:27,342
We've had an update on the
takeover of the Nakatomi Building-

909
01:17:27,446 --> 01:17:29,437
Sources say
the terrorist leader, " Hans,"

910
01:17:29,548 --> 01:17:31,948
may be this man-
Hans Gruber,

911
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:34,951
<i>a member of the radical
West German Volksfrei movement.</i>

912
01:17:35,053 --> 01:17:36,953
<i>Strangely,
the Volksfrei leadership...</i>

913
01:17:37,055 --> 01:17:39,387
issued a communique
an hour ago...

914
01:17:39,491 --> 01:17:41,585
stating Gruber had been expelled
from that organization-

915
01:17:41,694 --> 01:17:43,491
Al? Al? Do you copy?

916
01:17:43,596 --> 01:17:45,564
Are you all right?

917
01:17:45,665 --> 01:17:47,155
Yeah, I'm fine.

918
01:17:49,035 --> 01:17:50,502
What was that?

919
01:17:50,603 --> 01:17:53,401
Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?

920
01:17:53,506 --> 01:17:56,407
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

921
01:17:56,509 --> 01:17:59,342
No, but it's going to
need a paint job.

922
01:17:59,445 --> 01:18:02,346
Our spotter said
you got two that time.

923
01:18:02,448 --> 01:18:04,177
Is that him?

924
01:18:04,284 --> 01:18:05,683
Yes, sir.

925
01:18:05,785 --> 01:18:08,686
I don't know
who you think you are,

926
01:18:08,788 --> 01:18:12,281
but you just destroyed
a building.

927
01:18:12,393 --> 01:18:15,521
We do not want your help.
Is that clear?

928
01:18:15,629 --> 01:18:18,029
I've got 100 people
down here,

929
01:18:18,132 --> 01:18:20,032
and they're covered
with glass.

930
01:18:20,134 --> 01:18:22,364
Who gives a shit
about glass?

931
01:18:22,469 --> 01:18:24,460
Who the fuck is this?

932
01:18:24,571 --> 01:18:27,540
This is deputy chief of police,
Dwayne T. Robinson,

933
01:18:27,641 --> 01:18:30,940
and I am in charge
of this situation.

934
01:18:31,045 --> 01:18:32,535
Oh, you're in charge?

935
01:18:32,646 --> 01:18:34,876
I got bad news
for you, Dwayne.

936
01:18:34,982 --> 01:18:38,213
It doesn't look like you're
in charge of jack shit.

937
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:41,289
- Listen to me, you little asshole-
- Asshole?

938
01:18:41,389 --> 01:18:46,019
I'm not the one who just got
buttfucked on national TV, Dwayne!

939
01:18:46,127 --> 01:18:48,288
<i>Listen to me, jerkoff,</i>

940
01:18:48,396 --> 01:18:51,365
quit being part
of the fucking problem...

941
01:18:51,466 --> 01:18:54,367
and put the other guy
back on!

942
01:18:56,972 --> 01:18:59,167
Hey, Roy, how are
you feeling?

943
01:18:59,274 --> 01:19:01,037
Pretty fucking
unappreciated, Al.

944
01:19:01,142 --> 01:19:02,871
Hey, look.
I love you.

945
01:19:02,978 --> 01:19:05,913
So do a lot
of the other guys.

946
01:19:06,014 --> 01:19:08,380
You hang in there.
You hear me?

947
01:19:08,483 --> 01:19:10,543
You hang in there.

948
01:19:11,988 --> 01:19:15,014
Yeah, thanks, partner.

949
01:19:19,495 --> 01:19:21,395
What are you doing?

950
01:19:21,497 --> 01:19:23,897
I'm tired
of waiting to see...

951
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,231
who gets us killed first-
them or your husband.

952
01:19:27,336 --> 01:19:29,031
What are you
going to do?

953
01:19:29,138 --> 01:19:32,403
Hey, babe, I negotiate
million-dollar deals for breakfast.

954
01:19:32,508 --> 01:19:34,999
I think I can
handle this " Euro-trash. "

955
01:19:35,111 --> 01:19:37,579
<i>Hey,
sprechen sie, talk?</i>

956
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:40,411
If you'd listened to me,
he'd be neutralized.

957
01:19:40,517 --> 01:19:43,418
<i>I don't want neutral. I want dead.</i>

958
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,681
Hope I'm not
interrupting.

959
01:19:45,789 --> 01:19:46,813
What does he want?

960
01:19:46,923 --> 01:19:48,584
It's not
what I want.

961
01:19:48,692 --> 01:19:51,092
It's what
I can give you.

962
01:19:58,035 --> 01:20:00,333
<i>Oy, let's be
straight, okay?</i>

963
01:20:00,437 --> 01:20:02,428
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck up here...

964
01:20:02,539 --> 01:20:05,099
to snatch a few purses,
am I right?

965
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:06,766
Very perceptive.

966
01:20:06,877 --> 01:20:08,435
<i>I watch
60 Minutes.</i>

967
01:20:08,545 --> 01:20:11,276
I say to myself,
"these guys are professional,

968
01:20:11,382 --> 01:20:13,282
"they're motivated,
they're happening,

969
01:20:13,384 --> 01:20:15,477
i. e., they want
something," huh?

970
01:20:15,586 --> 01:20:18,384
<i>I couldn't care less
about your politics.</i>

971
01:20:18,489 --> 01:20:20,616
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys,

972
01:20:20,725 --> 01:20:22,283
maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern Ireland-

973
01:20:22,393 --> 01:20:23,451
It's none
of my business.

974
01:20:23,561 --> 01:20:26,155
I figure you're here to negotiate.
Am I right?

975
01:20:26,264 --> 01:20:27,663
You're amazing.

976
01:20:27,765 --> 01:20:29,756
You figured this
all out already?

977
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:31,630
Hey, business
is business.

978
01:20:31,736 --> 01:20:34,637
You use a gun. I use a fountain
pen. What's the difference?

979
01:20:34,739 --> 01:20:36,969
Let's put it
in my terms.

980
01:20:37,075 --> 01:20:39,203
You're here on a hostile takeover.
You grab us for some greenmail,

981
01:20:39,311 --> 01:20:42,610
<i>but you didn't expect
some poison pill running around.</i>

982
01:20:42,714 --> 01:20:45,410
Am I right?

983
01:20:45,517 --> 01:20:49,078
Hans, bubby, I'm
your white knight.

984
01:20:49,188 --> 01:20:51,748
<i>I must have missed
60 Minutes.</i>

985
01:20:51,857 --> 01:20:53,950
What are you saying?

986
01:20:56,028 --> 01:20:59,088
The guy upstairs is
fucking things up, huh?

987
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:05,935
I can give him to you.

988
01:21:08,674 --> 01:21:10,734
<i>Oh, God...</i>

989
01:21:10,844 --> 01:21:11,936
Uhh...

990
01:21:12,045 --> 01:21:12,943
Roy?

991
01:21:13,046 --> 01:21:15,207
Roy,
you all right?

992
01:21:15,315 --> 01:21:18,944
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

993
01:21:19,052 --> 01:21:22,021
What do they put
in these things anyway?

994
01:21:22,122 --> 01:21:24,682
Sugar, enriched flour,

995
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:26,691
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,

996
01:21:26,793 --> 01:21:28,954
polysorbate 60...

997
01:21:29,062 --> 01:21:31,189
and yellow dye
number five-

998
01:21:31,297 --> 01:21:33,697
Just everything
a growing boy needs.

999
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,200
How many kids
you got, Al?

1000
01:21:36,302 --> 01:21:40,364
My wife is working
on our first.

1001
01:21:40,474 --> 01:21:42,533
How about you,
cowboy?

1002
01:21:42,643 --> 01:21:44,508
You got any kids?

1003
01:21:45,813 --> 01:21:49,078
Yeah... two.

1004
01:21:49,183 --> 01:21:53,279
Hope I can see 'em swingin' on
a jungle gym with AIJr. someday.

1005
01:21:55,322 --> 01:21:57,222
Well, now,
that's a date,

1006
01:21:57,324 --> 01:22:00,225
but you bring
the ice cream.

1007
01:22:00,327 --> 01:22:02,227
<i>Touching, cowboy. Touching.</i>

1008
01:22:02,329 --> 01:22:04,661
<i>Or should I call you...</i>

1009
01:22:04,765 --> 01:22:07,563
Mr. McClane.?

1010
01:22:07,668 --> 01:22:10,900
Mr. OfficerJohn McClane...

1011
01:22:11,006 --> 01:22:14,601
<i>of the New York
Police Department?</i>

1012
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:17,542
- Get on the phone to Harry in New York.
Come on, baby. Move.! - Got it.

1013
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:19,876
Better get a hold
of somebody at dispatch.

1014
01:22:19,981 --> 01:22:23,747
Sister Theresa called me
Mr. McClane in the third grade,

1015
01:22:23,852 --> 01:22:25,752
my friends call me John,

1016
01:22:25,854 --> 01:22:28,880
and you're neither,
shithead.

1017
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:32,756
I have someone
who wants to talk to you-

1018
01:22:32,861 --> 01:22:35,489
A very special friend...

1019
01:22:35,597 --> 01:22:38,088
<i>who was with you
at the party tonight.</i>

1020
01:22:43,806 --> 01:22:46,206
Hey, John boy.

1021
01:22:47,476 --> 01:22:48,534
Ellis?

1022
01:22:48,644 --> 01:22:50,544
Yeah.
Now, listen, John.

1023
01:22:50,646 --> 01:22:52,614
They're giving me
a few minutes...

1024
01:22:52,715 --> 01:22:54,649
to try to talk
some sense into you.

1025
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,742
I know you think
you're doin' your job,

1026
01:22:57,853 --> 01:23:00,617
but you're just
draggin' this thing out.

1027
01:23:00,723 --> 01:23:04,124
<i>No one gets out of here
until these guys can talk...</i>

1028
01:23:04,227 --> 01:23:05,626
to the L.A. police, and that
just ain't gonna happen...

1029
01:23:05,728 --> 01:23:07,889
<i>till you stop messing up
the works, capisci?</i>

1030
01:23:12,736 --> 01:23:15,227
Ellis, what have
you told them?

1031
01:23:15,339 --> 01:23:19,332
I told them
we were old friends,

1032
01:23:19,443 --> 01:23:21,638
and you were
my guest.

1033
01:23:21,745 --> 01:23:23,940
You shouldn't
be doing this.

1034
01:23:24,047 --> 01:23:25,708
Tell me about it.

1035
01:23:31,655 --> 01:23:33,623
All right, John,
listen.

1036
01:23:33,724 --> 01:23:36,716
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.

1037
01:23:36,827 --> 01:23:39,160
They know people
are listening.

1038
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:40,993
They want
the detonators,

1039
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:43,260
or they're
going to kill me.

1040
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:48,230
John, didn't you
hear me?

1041
01:23:50,441 --> 01:23:52,602
Yeah, I hear you.

1042
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:54,337
John, get
with the program.

1043
01:23:54,445 --> 01:23:55,844
Tell these guys...

1044
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:57,346
where
the detonators are...

1045
01:23:57,448 --> 01:23:59,507
so no one else
gets hurt!

1046
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:02,518
I'm putting my life
on the line, pal!

1047
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,349
Ellis,
listen to me carefully.

1048
01:24:04,455 --> 01:24:05,717
John-

1049
01:24:05,823 --> 01:24:07,689
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!

1050
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:09,988
Put Hans back on!

1051
01:24:10,095 --> 01:24:14,191
Hans, this shithead doesn't
know you, but I do-

1052
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,201
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want.

1053
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,703
You're not part
of this equation.

1054
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:22,831
What am I,
a method actor?

1055
01:24:22,941 --> 01:24:24,340
Put away the gun.

1056
01:24:24,443 --> 01:24:26,206
This is radio,
not television.

1057
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:29,713
Hans, he's not my friend!
I don't know him!

1058
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,715
Jesus, Ellis!
They'll kill you!

1059
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,047
Tell them
you don't know me!

1060
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:37,612
How can you say that
after all these years?

1061
01:24:37,724 --> 01:24:41,660
John? John?

1062
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,513
Do you hear that?

1063
01:25:05,618 --> 01:25:08,679
Talk to me! Where
are my detonators?

1064
01:25:08,789 --> 01:25:10,188
Where are they,

1065
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:12,282
or shall I shoot
another one?

1066
01:25:12,393 --> 01:25:13,792
Sooner or later,

1067
01:25:13,894 --> 01:25:16,192
I'll get to someone
you care about.

1068
01:25:16,297 --> 01:25:18,527
Go fuck
yourself, Hans.

1069
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,429
Did you hear that?

1070
01:25:22,536 --> 01:25:25,699
He just let
the guy die, man.

1071
01:25:25,806 --> 01:25:28,206
Man, can't you see
what's happening?

1072
01:25:28,309 --> 01:25:30,709
Can't you read
between the lines?

1073
01:25:30,811 --> 01:25:32,210
He did everything
he could...

1074
01:25:32,313 --> 01:25:33,712
to save him.

1075
01:25:33,814 --> 01:25:36,715
If he gave up,
they'd both be dead!

1076
01:25:36,817 --> 01:25:39,150
No. They'd be
talking to us.

1077
01:25:39,254 --> 01:25:42,655
You tell your partner
to stay out of this.

1078
01:25:42,758 --> 01:25:44,157
If he doesn't,

1079
01:25:44,259 --> 01:25:45,658
I'm going to
nail his ass.

1080
01:25:45,761 --> 01:25:47,661
The man is hurting.

1081
01:25:47,763 --> 01:25:49,663
He is alone, tired,

1082
01:25:49,765 --> 01:25:51,858
and he hasn't seen
diddly-squat...

1083
01:25:51,967 --> 01:25:53,366
from anybody here!

1084
01:25:53,468 --> 01:25:56,164
You think
he'll give a damn...

1085
01:25:56,271 --> 01:25:59,206
<i>about what you do
if he makes it?</i>

1086
01:25:59,307 --> 01:26:02,003
Wake up and smell
what you shoveling.

1087
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:05,011
Anytime you want
to go home,

1088
01:26:05,113 --> 01:26:07,480
you consider
yourself dismissed.

1089
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:10,177
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

1090
01:26:10,286 --> 01:26:12,184
<i>Attention, police.</i>

1091
01:26:13,456 --> 01:26:16,050
Attention, police.

1092
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,354
This is Sergeant
Al Powell-

1093
01:26:18,461 --> 01:26:20,861
This is deputy chief
Dwayne Robinson.

1094
01:26:20,963 --> 01:26:22,897
Who is this?

1095
01:26:22,999 --> 01:26:24,523
This is Hans Gruber.

1096
01:26:24,634 --> 01:26:27,865
I assume you realize
the futility of direct action.

1097
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:31,303
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

1098
01:26:31,407 --> 01:26:34,399
Well, what is it
you do wish for?

1099
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:36,706
I have comrades
around the world...

1100
01:26:36,814 --> 01:26:38,543
languishing
in prison.

1101
01:26:38,649 --> 01:26:40,480
The American
State Department...

1102
01:26:40,584 --> 01:26:42,984
enjoys rattling its saber
for itself.

1103
01:26:43,086 --> 01:26:45,987
Now it can rattle it
for me.

1104
01:26:46,089 --> 01:26:49,650
The following are to be
released from their captors-

1105
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,457
The seven members
of the New Provo Front,

1106
01:26:53,564 --> 01:26:58,126
<i>in Canada, the five imprisoned
leaders of Libert du Quebec,</i>

1107
01:26:58,235 --> 01:27:01,671
in Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.

1108
01:27:01,772 --> 01:27:03,706
What the fuck?

1109
01:27:05,809 --> 01:27:08,506
<i>I read about them
in Time magazine.</i>

1110
01:27:08,613 --> 01:27:12,014
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

1111
01:27:12,116 --> 01:27:15,017
the hostages will be
taken to the roof...

1112
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:17,519
and will accompany us
in helicopters...

1113
01:27:17,622 --> 01:27:20,022
to the Los Angeles
International Airport...

1114
01:27:20,124 --> 01:27:22,354
where they'll be given
further instructions.

1115
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:25,020
You have two hours
to comply.

1116
01:27:25,129 --> 01:27:26,858
Wait a minute,
Mr. Gruber.

1117
01:27:26,965 --> 01:27:28,364
This is crazy.

1118
01:27:28,466 --> 01:27:29,865
I don't have
the authority.

1119
01:27:29,968 --> 01:27:32,368
Two hours
is not enough.

1120
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:35,701
Hello? Hello!

1121
01:27:35,807 --> 01:27:37,708
Did you get
all that?

1122
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:40,005
We got to make
some calls.

1123
01:27:40,112 --> 01:27:42,273
Do you think
they'll try?

1124
01:27:42,381 --> 01:27:43,814
Who cares?

1125
01:27:46,752 --> 01:27:48,947
Theo, are we
on schedule?

1126
01:27:49,054 --> 01:27:51,750
One more. Then
it's up to you.

1127
01:27:51,857 --> 01:27:54,451
This one will
take a miracle.

1128
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,959
It's Christmas, Theo.

1129
01:27:56,061 --> 01:27:59,258
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer.

1130
01:27:59,365 --> 01:28:02,266
Call me when you hit
the last lock.

1131
01:28:02,368 --> 01:28:07,102
Hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

1132
01:28:07,207 --> 01:28:10,301
Fritz is checking
the explosives.

1133
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:12,071
I'll check
the explosives.

1134
01:28:12,178 --> 01:28:14,510
Hey, Powell,
you out there?

1135
01:28:14,614 --> 01:28:17,742
I'm here, John.
I'm here.

1136
01:28:17,851 --> 01:28:21,287
Believe me, there was
nothing I could do.

1137
01:28:21,388 --> 01:28:23,788
It's gonna be
both our asses...

1138
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:25,414
if you're wrong.

1139
01:28:25,525 --> 01:28:27,186
I hear you.

1140
01:28:32,299 --> 01:28:35,325
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

1141
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:37,700
It doesn't
make sense, man.

1142
01:28:37,805 --> 01:28:39,830
I'm just
a desk jockey...

1143
01:28:39,941 --> 01:28:43,342
who was on my way
home when you rang.

1144
01:28:43,444 --> 01:28:44,843
The way you drove,

1145
01:28:44,946 --> 01:28:47,312
I figured you
for the street.

1146
01:28:47,415 --> 01:28:50,077
In my youth.
In my youth.

1147
01:28:50,217 --> 01:28:53,152
<i>...Author of Hostage Terrorist,

01:28:55,456 --> 01:28:59,825
<i>What can we expect
in the next few hours?</i>

1150
01:28:59,927 --> 01:29:01,656
The hostages
are probably experiencing...

1151
01:29:01,762 --> 01:29:04,663
the early stages
of the Helsinki Syndrome.

1152
01:29:04,765 --> 01:29:06,825
As in Helsinki,
Sweden.

1153
01:29:06,935 --> 01:29:08,493
Finland.

1154
01:29:08,604 --> 01:29:10,003
Basically, it's when
the hostages...

1155
01:29:10,105 --> 01:29:11,504
and the terrorists...

1156
01:29:11,607 --> 01:29:14,667
go through a sort of
psychological transference...

1157
01:29:14,776 --> 01:29:17,108
and a projection
of dependency.

1158
01:29:17,212 --> 01:29:19,840
<i>A strange sort of trust
and bond develops.</i>

1159
01:29:19,948 --> 01:29:22,348
<i>We've had situations
where the hostages...</i>

1160
01:29:22,451 --> 01:29:24,351
<i>embraced their captors
after release...</i>

1161
01:29:24,453 --> 01:29:27,547
<i>and even corresponded
with them in prison.</i>

D- A-W-N.

1164
01:29:33,128 --> 01:29:34,186
Sir?

1165
01:29:34,296 --> 01:29:35,194
Yeah?

1166
01:29:35,297 --> 01:29:37,198
The FBI is here.

1167
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,131
The FBI is here now?

1168
01:29:39,235 --> 01:29:41,362
Yes, sir.
Right over there.

1169
01:29:41,471 --> 01:29:42,233
Hold this.

1170
01:29:42,338 --> 01:29:44,636
Want a breath mint?

1171
01:29:48,244 --> 01:29:50,644
Hey, how you
doing, man?

1172
01:29:50,747 --> 01:29:52,146
I'm Agent Johnson.

1173
01:29:52,248 --> 01:29:53,647
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1174
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:55,650
Oh, how you doing?

1175
01:29:55,752 --> 01:29:57,310
No relation.

1176
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:58,648
I'm, uh...

1177
01:29:58,755 --> 01:30:00,655
I'm Dwayne Robinson,

1178
01:30:00,757 --> 01:30:03,658
I'm in charge here.

1179
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,319
Not anymore.

1180
01:31:00,285 --> 01:31:04,346
Hi there.
How you doing?

1181
01:31:07,626 --> 01:31:09,526
Ooh...

1182
01:31:09,628 --> 01:31:12,859
Please, God. You're
one of them, aren't you?

1183
01:31:12,965 --> 01:31:15,024
You're one of them.

1184
01:31:15,134 --> 01:31:18,194
No! Don't kill me!
No, please.

1185
01:31:18,304 --> 01:31:21,034
Don't kill me,
please! No!

1186
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:23,574
Relax. I'm not
going to hurt you.

1187
01:31:23,676 --> 01:31:25,143
I won't hurt you!

1188
01:31:28,147 --> 01:31:30,047
Oh, God.

1189
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:34,483
What the fuck are
you doing up here?

1190
01:31:34,587 --> 01:31:36,556
What were you
looking for?

1191
01:31:36,656 --> 01:31:39,557
I managed to get
out of there.

1192
01:31:39,659 --> 01:31:43,060
I was trying to get
up on the roof...

1193
01:31:43,163 --> 01:31:46,064
and see if I could
signal for help.

1194
01:31:46,166 --> 01:31:48,293
Why don't you
come and help?

1195
01:31:48,401 --> 01:31:51,564
Hold it. Hold it.
Forget the roof.

1196
01:31:51,671 --> 01:31:53,070
Forget the roof.

1197
01:31:53,173 --> 01:31:55,573
They got people
all over it.

1198
01:31:55,675 --> 01:31:58,803
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.

1199
01:32:01,715 --> 01:32:04,206
The best
we can figure it,

1200
01:32:04,317 --> 01:32:07,219
we've got maybe 30 or 35
hostages up there,

1201
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:09,221
probably
on the 30th floor,

1202
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:13,089
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

1203
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,253
Sounds like
an A-7 scenario.

1204
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,092
We'll handle it
from here.

1205
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:18,597
When we
commandeer your men,

1206
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,132
we'll let you know.

1207
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:21,633
Aren't you...

1208
01:32:21,736 --> 01:32:23,101
forgetting something?

1209
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:24,102
Such as?

1210
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:25,638
What about
John McClane?

1211
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,139
He's the reason...

1212
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:28,833
we have
any information.

1213
01:32:28,943 --> 01:32:30,706
He's also the reason...

1214
01:32:30,812 --> 01:32:32,541
you're only facing
seven terrorists.

1215
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:35,014
He's inside?
Who is he?

1216
01:32:35,117 --> 01:32:38,018
He might be a cop.
We're checking.

1217
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,451
One of yours?

1218
01:32:39,555 --> 01:32:40,613
No way.

1219
01:32:45,494 --> 01:32:47,121
You smoke?

1220
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:50,062
Yeah.

1221
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,728
Thanks.

1222
01:33:00,175 --> 01:33:02,837
You don't work
for Nakatomi.

1223
01:33:05,682 --> 01:33:08,879
And if you're not
one of them-

1224
01:33:11,054 --> 01:33:13,545
I'm a cop
from New York.

1225
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:17,091
New York?

1226
01:33:17,193 --> 01:33:21,425
Yeah. Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

1227
01:33:21,531 --> 01:33:23,328
Who knew?

1228
01:33:29,305 --> 01:33:33,401
<i>Well, it's better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?</i>

1229
01:33:43,554 --> 01:33:44,816
I'm John McClane.

1230
01:33:46,156 --> 01:33:49,057
<i>You're, uh...</i>

1231
01:33:49,159 --> 01:33:50,217
Clay.

1232
01:33:52,162 --> 01:33:53,857
Bill Clay.

1233
01:33:59,169 --> 01:34:02,161
Know how to use
a handgun, Bill?

1234
01:34:02,273 --> 01:34:05,243
I spent a weekend
at a combat ranch-

1235
01:34:05,343 --> 01:34:07,971
The guns that shoot
red paint.

1236
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:12,072
Probably seems
kind of stupid to you.

1237
01:34:12,183 --> 01:34:13,275
Nope.

1238
01:34:15,186 --> 01:34:17,677
Time for the real
thing, Bill.

1239
01:34:26,364 --> 01:34:29,800
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

1240
01:34:49,155 --> 01:34:51,055
Put down the gun...

1241
01:34:51,157 --> 01:34:53,523
and give me
my detonators.

1242
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:00,997
Well, well, well...

1243
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,431
Hans.

1244
01:35:02,535 --> 01:35:05,972
Put it down now.

1245
01:35:09,609 --> 01:35:12,510
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

1246
01:35:12,612 --> 01:35:15,638
You ought to be
on fucking TV.

1247
01:35:18,118 --> 01:35:22,384
What do you want
with the detonators, Hans?

1248
01:35:22,489 --> 01:35:25,458
I already used
all the explosives...

1249
01:35:26,994 --> 01:35:28,791
or did I?

1250
01:35:28,895 --> 01:35:31,489
I'm going to
count to three.

1251
01:35:31,598 --> 01:35:32,530
Yeah.

1252
01:35:32,632 --> 01:35:34,260
Like you did
with Takagi?

1253
01:35:35,370 --> 01:35:36,268
Oops.

1254
01:35:38,172 --> 01:35:39,662
No bullets.

1255
01:35:39,774 --> 01:35:42,607
- What do you think-
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1256
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:43,677
You we're saying?

1257
01:36:37,967 --> 01:36:38,865
Karl.

1258
01:36:47,877 --> 01:36:50,505
Shoot the glass!

1259
01:37:23,647 --> 01:37:25,979
Jesus Christ!

1260
01:37:54,513 --> 01:37:57,573
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

1261
01:38:00,385 --> 01:38:02,684
<i>...is the last resort
of diplomacy,</i>

1262
01:38:02,788 --> 01:38:05,018
<i>couldn't we
just as well say...</i>

1263
01:38:05,124 --> 01:38:07,456
<i>that terrorism
has an equal claim...</i>

1264
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,494
<i>on being that, too?</i>

1265
01:38:09,595 --> 01:38:12,359
You got something.
Tell me you got something.

1266
01:38:12,465 --> 01:38:15,195
Just McClane's name,
badge number, employment record,

1267
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:17,895
vital statistics,
and his family's home address,

1268
01:38:18,004 --> 01:38:20,404
right here in L.A.

1269
01:38:20,506 --> 01:38:23,031
Woo!

1270
01:38:28,281 --> 01:38:30,044
Go to work.

1271
01:38:30,149 --> 01:38:31,548
You got it.

1272
01:38:43,497 --> 01:38:45,397
God!
That man looks...

1273
01:38:45,499 --> 01:38:47,057
really pissed.

1274
01:38:48,669 --> 01:38:51,069
He's still alive.

1275
01:38:51,171 --> 01:38:53,071
What?

1276
01:38:53,173 --> 01:38:57,234
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.

1277
01:39:13,194 --> 01:39:15,788
Hans, you better
heat up that miracle.

1278
01:39:15,897 --> 01:39:18,457
We broke through
on number six.

1279
01:39:18,566 --> 01:39:21,228
The electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

1280
01:39:21,336 --> 01:39:24,533
See what our friends
outside are doing,

1281
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:26,573
and I'll be right up.

1282
01:39:28,076 --> 01:39:29,976
Hey, John.
John McClane,

1283
01:39:30,078 --> 01:39:31,979
you still with us?

1284
01:39:32,081 --> 01:39:33,480
Yeah.

1285
01:39:33,582 --> 01:39:34,981
All things being equal,

1286
01:39:35,084 --> 01:39:37,484
I'd rather be
in Philadelphia.

1287
01:39:37,586 --> 01:39:40,419
Chalk up
two more bad guys.

1288
01:39:40,522 --> 01:39:42,422
Well, the boys
down here...

1289
01:39:42,524 --> 01:39:44,924
will be glad
to hear that.

1290
01:39:45,027 --> 01:39:47,928
We got a pool
going on you.

1291
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:49,930
What kind of odds
am I getting?

1292
01:39:50,032 --> 01:39:52,432
<i>- You don't want to know.
- Put me down for 20.</i>

1293
01:39:52,534 --> 01:39:54,900
I'm good for it.

1294
01:39:56,538 --> 01:39:59,871
<i>Hey, pal, you got flat feet?</i>

1295
01:40:01,878 --> 01:40:04,972
What the hell are
you talking about?

1296
01:40:05,081 --> 01:40:07,982
Something had to
get you off the street.

1297
01:40:08,084 --> 01:40:09,984
You don't think
jockeying papers...

1298
01:40:10,086 --> 01:40:12,020
is a noble effort?

1299
01:40:13,823 --> 01:40:15,222
<i>No.</i>

1300
01:40:18,328 --> 01:40:20,228
I had an accident.

1301
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:24,027
<i>The way you drive,
I can see why.</i>

1302
01:40:24,134 --> 01:40:26,568
You run over
your captain's foot?

1303
01:40:29,839 --> 01:40:31,774
I shot a kid.

1304
01:40:31,876 --> 01:40:34,276
<i>He was 13 years old.</i>

1305
01:40:34,378 --> 01:40:37,279
Oh, it was dark.
I couldn't see him.

1306
01:40:37,381 --> 01:40:40,350
<i>Oh, it was dark. He had a ray
gun that looked real enough.</i>

1307
01:40:43,854 --> 01:40:45,719
When you're a rookie,
they can teach you...

1308
01:40:45,823 --> 01:40:47,222
everything
about being a cop,

1309
01:40:47,325 --> 01:40:49,293
except how to live
with a mistake.

1310
01:40:52,830 --> 01:40:55,230
<i>Anyway, I just
couldn't bring myself...</i>

1311
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:58,962
<i>to draw my gun
on anybody again.</i>

1312
01:41:00,838 --> 01:41:02,739
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

1313
01:41:02,841 --> 01:41:06,743
Hey, man,
how could you know?

1314
01:41:08,847 --> 01:41:12,010
I feel like shit
anyway.

1315
01:41:12,117 --> 01:41:15,644
Well, then,
this won't matter.

1316
01:41:15,754 --> 01:41:17,779
<i>The L.A.P.D. is not...</i>

1317
01:41:17,889 --> 01:41:20,323
<i>calling the shots
down here anymore.</i>

1318
01:41:22,361 --> 01:41:24,056
The feds?

1319
01:41:24,162 --> 01:41:25,561
You got it.

1320
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:31,261
All right.
Those are the city engineers.

1321
01:41:31,371 --> 01:41:34,272
They're going into
the street circuits.

1322
01:41:34,374 --> 01:41:36,774
<i>Those guys in the suits,
I don't know who they are.</i>

1323
01:41:36,876 --> 01:41:38,343
<i>That's the FBI.</i>

1324
01:41:38,444 --> 01:41:40,275
They're ordering
the others...

1325
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,280
to cut
the building's power.

1326
01:41:42,382 --> 01:41:44,850
Regular
as clockwork.

1327
01:41:46,386 --> 01:41:48,286
Or a time lock.

1328
01:41:48,388 --> 01:41:50,652
<i>Precisely.</i>

1329
01:41:50,757 --> 01:41:53,123
The circuits
that cannot be cut...

1330
01:41:53,226 --> 01:41:54,625
are cut automatically...

1331
01:41:54,727 --> 01:41:57,127
in response to
a terrorist incident.

1332
01:41:57,230 --> 01:41:59,130
You asked for miracles.

1333
01:41:59,232 --> 01:42:02,259
I give you the FBI.

1334
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:05,060
I want the building shut down.

1335
01:42:05,261 --> 01:42:07,761
I got a problem. I got a switch...

1336
01:42:07,762 --> 01:42:11,662
I don't care about your switch.
I want it out. Dark!

1337
01:42:13,063 --> 01:42:14,663
You can't do it from here.

1338
01:42:14,664 --> 01:42:17,064
- Yeah, you could.
- It can't be done from here.

1339
01:42:17,065 --> 01:42:18,265
I could just... I got the radio...

1340
01:42:18,266 --> 01:42:22,366
You can't do it from here.
It's got to be done from downtown.

1341
01:42:22,567 --> 01:42:23,867
They've gotta take out
a whole city grid.

1342
01:42:23,868 --> 01:42:26,068
We're talking 10 square blocks.

1343
01:42:26,069 --> 01:42:28,269
Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.

1344
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:30,370
It's Christmas Eve.
There's thousands of people.

1345
01:42:30,371 --> 01:42:31,671
You have to go wider.

1346
01:42:32,072 --> 01:42:36,272
- I need authorisation.
- How about the United States government?

1347
01:42:37,273 --> 01:42:39,673
Lose the grid, or you lose your job.

1348
01:42:46,074 --> 01:42:47,474
- Yeah, Central?
- Yeah?

1349
01:42:47,475 --> 01:42:49,975
This is Walt down at Nakatomi.

1350
01:42:50,776 --> 01:42:55,376
Would it be possible for you
to turn off grid 212?

1351
01:42:55,577 --> 01:42:56,677
Are you crazy?!

1352
01:42:56,678 --> 01:42:58,178
Maybe I should call the Mayor.

1353
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:01,379
No shit it's my ass.
I got a big problem here.

1354
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:03,680
Shut it down, Shut it down now.

1355
01:43:08,281 --> 01:43:10,381
Emergency lighting activated.

1356
01:43:10,882 --> 01:43:14,082
Al, talk to me. What's going on here?

1357
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:15,483
Ask the FBl.

1358
01:43:15,984 --> 01:43:18,084
They got the universal
terrorist playbook

1359
01:43:18,085 --> 01:43:20,785
and they're running it step by step.

1360
01:43:22,886 --> 01:43:23,886
It's going to go.

1361
01:43:23,957 --> 01:43:25,015
It's going to go!

1362
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:28,218
Yes!

1363
01:43:50,785 --> 01:43:52,184
Merry Christmas.

1364
01:43:54,088 --> 01:43:56,852
Those bastards are probably
pissing in their pants.

1365
01:43:56,957 --> 01:43:59,118
The mayor will
have my ass.

1366
01:44:05,801 --> 01:44:07,200
Woo!

1367
01:44:20,582 --> 01:44:22,777
What will we do now?

1368
01:44:22,884 --> 01:44:25,717
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

1369
01:44:25,821 --> 01:44:27,721
We've shut them down.

1370
01:44:27,823 --> 01:44:29,222
We let them sweat,

1371
01:44:29,324 --> 01:44:31,259
then give them
helicopters.

1372
01:44:31,361 --> 01:44:33,226
Right up the ass.

1373
01:44:35,331 --> 01:44:39,165
This is Agent Johnson.
No, the other one.

1374
01:44:39,268 --> 01:44:42,169
I want air support
ready in five minutes.

1375
01:44:42,271 --> 01:44:44,034
Damn right.
Fully armed.

1376
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:46,005
<i>We're on the way.</i>

1377
01:44:52,782 --> 01:44:53,874
Yeah!

1378
01:44:53,983 --> 01:44:57,885
I wish to talk to the FBI.

1379
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:02,758
This is
Special Agent Johnson.

1380
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:04,760
The State Department
has arranged...

1381
01:45:04,862 --> 01:45:07,296
for the return
of your comrades.

1382
01:45:07,398 --> 01:45:10,196
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

1383
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:11,699
We'll be ready.

1384
01:45:11,802 --> 01:45:13,201
When he realizes
what hit him,

1385
01:45:13,303 --> 01:45:14,827
he'll be dead.

1386
01:45:14,938 --> 01:45:17,839
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1387
01:45:17,941 --> 01:45:19,841
By the time
they figure out...

1388
01:45:19,943 --> 01:45:21,342
what went wrong,

1389
01:45:21,445 --> 01:45:23,379
we'll be sitting
on a beach...

1390
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:24,742
earning 20%.

1391
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:31,220
Ah!Jeez!

1392
01:45:31,322 --> 01:45:34,951
Powell?
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1393
01:45:36,661 --> 01:45:38,390
I'm here, John.

1394
01:45:40,098 --> 01:45:43,499
I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

1395
01:45:43,601 --> 01:45:46,502
I want you to do
something for me.

1396
01:45:46,604 --> 01:45:48,162
Um...

1397
01:45:48,273 --> 01:45:51,174
I want you
to find my wife.

1398
01:45:51,276 --> 01:45:53,176
Don't ask me how.

1399
01:45:53,278 --> 01:45:56,179
I want you
to tell her something.

1400
01:45:56,281 --> 01:45:59,183
I want you
to tell her that...

1401
01:45:59,285 --> 01:46:00,684
Um...

1402
01:46:02,288 --> 01:46:03,687
Mmm...

1403
01:46:05,791 --> 01:46:09,693
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out...

1404
01:46:09,795 --> 01:46:11,695
what a jerk I'd been,

1405
01:46:11,797 --> 01:46:15,198
but, um... that...

1406
01:46:19,305 --> 01:46:22,706
that when things started
to pan out for her,

1407
01:46:22,808 --> 01:46:25,709
I should have been
more supportive,

1408
01:46:25,811 --> 01:46:27,676
and, uh...

1409
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:30,875
I just should have
been behind her more.

1410
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:35,720
Oh, shit.

1411
01:46:38,325 --> 01:46:41,158
Tell her that, um...

1412
01:46:41,261 --> 01:46:44,162
that she's the best thing
that ever happened...

1413
01:46:44,264 --> 01:46:46,164
to a bum like me.

1414
01:46:47,767 --> 01:46:50,668
She's heard me say
"I love you"

1415
01:46:50,770 --> 01:46:52,169
a thousand times.

1416
01:46:52,272 --> 01:46:55,173
She never heard me
say "I'm sorry. "

1417
01:46:56,776 --> 01:46:59,678
I want you to
tell her that, Al.

1418
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:02,180
I want you
to tell her...

1419
01:47:02,283 --> 01:47:05,184
that John said
that he was sorry.

1420
01:47:05,286 --> 01:47:07,686
Okay?
You got that, man?

1421
01:47:07,788 --> 01:47:10,120
Yeah, I got it, John,

1422
01:47:10,224 --> 01:47:13,193
but you can
tell her that yourself.

1423
01:47:13,294 --> 01:47:16,195
Just watch your ass
and make it out.

1424
01:47:16,297 --> 01:47:17,696
You hear me?

1425
01:47:17,798 --> 01:47:20,790
I guess that's up to
the man upstairs.

1426
01:47:24,305 --> 01:47:28,207
John? John?

1427
01:47:28,309 --> 01:47:29,709
What the fuck...

1428
01:47:29,811 --> 01:47:31,210
were you doing
upstairs, Hans?

1429
01:47:33,315 --> 01:47:34,714
John?

1430
01:47:34,816 --> 01:47:36,215
Al, listen.

1431
01:47:36,318 --> 01:47:37,945
Just lay off
for a while.

1432
01:47:38,053 --> 01:47:41,318
<i>I got to go
check on something.</i>

1433
01:47:45,394 --> 01:47:48,158
One minute,
that's all I'm asking-

1434
01:47:48,263 --> 01:47:50,788
One minute
to speak to them.

1435
01:47:50,899 --> 01:47:53,163
All right.
Get back. Get back.

1436
01:47:53,268 --> 01:47:55,168
All right,
look, look, look.

1437
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:59,035
<i>- Let me in right now,
or I call the I.N.S. Comprende?</i>

1438
01:48:01,444 --> 01:48:02,672
This is the last time
these kids will have...

1439
01:48:02,779 --> 01:48:04,679
to speak
to their parents.

1440
01:48:06,783 --> 01:48:08,182
- All right?
- Mm.

1441
01:48:08,284 --> 01:48:10,946
All right.
Come on.

1442
01:48:20,463 --> 01:48:22,829
What were you
doing, Hans?

1443
01:48:22,932 --> 01:48:25,298
What were you doing?

1444
01:48:46,857 --> 01:48:49,917
Jesus, Mary,
Mother of God.

1445
01:48:54,131 --> 01:48:55,758
It's a double-cross!

1446
01:48:55,866 --> 01:48:57,766
The roof is wired to-

1447
01:49:00,872 --> 01:49:01,770
John?

1448
01:49:04,376 --> 01:49:05,274
John!

1449
01:49:06,511 --> 01:49:08,274
John, come in!

1450
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:10,280
Did you get that?

1451
01:49:10,382 --> 01:49:12,282
Something about
a double-cross.

1452
01:49:12,384 --> 01:49:14,784
Tell me about it.

1453
01:49:20,392 --> 01:49:22,292
We are both
professionals.

1454
01:49:24,396 --> 01:49:26,296
This is personal.

1455
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:29,299
Ah...

1456
01:49:30,603 --> 01:49:32,662
Aagh!

1457
01:49:43,716 --> 01:49:45,547
Aah!

1458
01:49:50,222 --> 01:49:52,256
They're coming!

1459
01:49:52,358 --> 01:49:54,258
The choppers
are coming.

1460
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:55,759
Okay,

1461
01:49:55,861 --> 01:49:58,763
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

1462
01:49:58,865 --> 01:50:02,665
<i>Your mom and dad
are very important people.</i>

1463
01:50:02,769 --> 01:50:05,067
<i>They're very brave people.</i>

1464
01:50:05,172 --> 01:50:08,505
<i>Is there something
you'd like to say to them?</i>

1465
01:50:08,608 --> 01:50:12,044
Come home.

1466
01:50:18,985 --> 01:50:21,783
Mrs. McClane.

1467
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:29,022
How nice to make
your acquaintance.

1468
01:50:31,966 --> 01:50:33,866
Everyone
to the roof!

1469
01:50:33,968 --> 01:50:36,198
Lock them there.
Come right back.

1470
01:50:43,411 --> 01:50:44,309
Ah!

1471
01:51:03,398 --> 01:51:06,390
You should have heard
your brother squeal...

1472
01:51:06,502 --> 01:51:09,562
when I broke
his fucking neck!

1473
01:51:12,975 --> 01:51:15,341
What do you
figure the breakage?

1474
01:51:15,444 --> 01:51:17,344
We take out
the terrorists,

1475
01:51:17,446 --> 01:51:20,677
lose 20, 25%
of the hostages... tops.

1476
01:51:20,783 --> 01:51:22,683
I can live
with that.

1477
01:51:22,785 --> 01:51:25,276
Get this thing
on the deck.

1478
01:51:25,387 --> 01:51:28,687
They're expecting
transports, not gun ships.

1479
01:51:40,737 --> 01:51:42,364
Move it!

1480
01:51:42,472 --> 01:51:44,337
Come on! Move!

1481
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:46,374
Move it!

1482
01:51:46,476 --> 01:51:48,376
Go! Move!

1483
01:51:51,481 --> 01:51:52,880
Theo.

1484
01:51:52,982 --> 01:51:54,882
A little bonus for us.

1485
01:51:54,984 --> 01:51:56,383
Please, sit down.

1486
01:51:56,486 --> 01:51:57,886
Sit down!

1487
01:51:57,988 --> 01:52:00,889
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

1488
01:52:00,991 --> 01:52:03,892
McClane, I have
some news for you.

1489
01:52:03,994 --> 01:52:06,019
McClane.

1490
01:52:06,130 --> 01:52:07,062
Ah!

1491
01:52:12,837 --> 01:52:14,532
Aah!

1492
01:52:16,407 --> 01:52:17,897
Come on! Move!

1493
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:20,909
Come on!

1494
01:52:29,855 --> 01:52:31,652
Yaah!

1495
01:52:33,525 --> 01:52:36,085
Motherfucker!
I'll kill you!

1496
01:52:39,464 --> 01:52:40,863
Armed.

1497
01:52:40,966 --> 01:52:42,365
The truck?

1498
01:52:42,467 --> 01:52:43,866
The truck.

1499
01:52:50,242 --> 01:52:51,869
After all
your posturing,

1500
01:52:51,977 --> 01:52:53,877
all your little
speeches,

1501
01:52:53,979 --> 01:52:57,541
you're nothing
but a common thief.

1502
01:52:57,650 --> 01:52:59,880
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs. McClane,

1503
01:52:59,986 --> 01:53:01,817
and since I'm moving
up to kidnapping,

1504
01:53:01,921 --> 01:53:03,889
you should be
more polite.

1505
01:53:05,424 --> 01:53:06,482
Yaah!

1506
01:53:09,495 --> 01:53:10,985
Oh!

1507
01:53:11,097 --> 01:53:13,190
Going to kill you!

1508
01:53:13,299 --> 01:53:15,199
I'm going to
fucking cook you!

1509
01:53:15,301 --> 01:53:16,529
Going to fucking
eat you!

1510
01:53:39,226 --> 01:53:41,217
I don't
like this, Sarge.

1511
01:53:49,336 --> 01:53:51,736
Yaa-hah!

1512
01:53:51,838 --> 01:53:53,738
Just like
fucking Saigon,

1513
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,398
Hey, slick?

1514
01:53:55,509 --> 01:53:59,241
I was in junior high,
dickhead.

1515
01:54:27,543 --> 01:54:28,942
Where's Holly?

1516
01:54:29,044 --> 01:54:30,443
Where's Holly Gennero?

1517
01:54:30,546 --> 01:54:32,446
Holly Gennero?
Where's Holly?

1518
01:54:32,548 --> 01:54:34,448
Where's Holly?
Where is she?

1519
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:35,949
They took her!
Where?

1520
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:37,450
The vault! Where is the vault?

1521
01:54:37,553 --> 01:54:39,384
The 30th floor!

1522
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,887
They took her!

1523
01:54:40,990 --> 01:54:42,617
Get downstairs!

1524
01:54:42,725 --> 01:54:46,889
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!

1525
01:54:46,996 --> 01:54:50,159
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!

1526
01:54:51,834 --> 01:54:53,734
They made us, Bureau. You got a
terrorist shooting at hostages.

1527
01:54:53,836 --> 01:54:55,133
Break left!

1528
01:55:02,746 --> 01:55:04,236
Nail that sucker!

1529
01:55:12,555 --> 01:55:15,490
I'm on your side,
you assholes!

1530
01:55:15,592 --> 01:55:17,025
Swing around again!

1531
01:55:17,127 --> 01:55:18,617
I'll bag
this little bastard.

1532
01:55:37,581 --> 01:55:39,412
What the fuck...

1533
01:55:41,519 --> 01:55:44,420
Oh, John, what the fuck
are you doing?

1534
01:55:44,522 --> 01:55:47,923
How the fuck did you
get into this shit?

1535
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:52,793
Aah! Aah!

1536
01:55:52,897 --> 01:55:55,058
Aah!

1537
01:55:55,167 --> 01:55:57,235
Aah!

1538
01:55:57,335 --> 01:56:00,736
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

1539
01:56:00,839 --> 01:56:01,863
Blow the roof.

1540
01:56:01,973 --> 01:56:03,201
Karl's up there!

1541
01:56:03,308 --> 01:56:04,297
Blow the roof!

1542
01:56:07,779 --> 01:56:10,680
I promise
I will never even think...

1543
01:56:10,782 --> 01:56:13,546
about going up
in a tall building again.

1544
01:56:15,821 --> 01:56:18,790
Oh, God,
please don't let me die!

1545
01:56:32,805 --> 01:56:34,295
Yaah!

1546
01:57:03,170 --> 01:57:05,104
Oh!

1547
01:57:24,124 --> 01:57:25,183
Aah!

1548
01:57:25,293 --> 01:57:26,487
Aah!

1549
01:57:50,952 --> 01:57:52,852
Holy Christ!

1550
01:57:53,955 --> 01:57:54,980
We're
going to need...

1551
01:57:55,090 --> 01:57:57,217
some more
FBI guys, I guess.

1552
01:57:57,326 --> 01:57:59,157
Aah! Aah!

1553
01:58:10,039 --> 01:58:12,166
Jesus fucking Christ!

1554
01:58:12,274 --> 01:58:13,673
Fuck!

1555
01:58:38,335 --> 01:58:40,735
What the fuck
is going on?

1556
01:58:42,038 --> 01:58:43,630
What are you going to do?

1557
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:45,298
Sit here while
the building falls?

1558
01:58:53,817 --> 01:58:55,547
Shit!

1559
01:58:55,653 --> 01:58:57,143
Oh! All right!

1560
01:58:57,255 --> 01:58:58,654
Uli.

1561
01:58:58,756 --> 01:59:00,121
Hey!
Hey!

1562
01:59:00,224 --> 01:59:02,158
Hang on, baby.

1563
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:04,660
Hang on, honey.

1564
01:59:04,762 --> 01:59:06,525
Oh, God.

1565
01:59:39,231 --> 01:59:40,459
Oh!

1566
01:59:44,603 --> 01:59:45,467
<i>Allez! Allez vite!</i>

1567
01:59:45,570 --> 01:59:47,902
<i>J'y vais!
J'y vais!</i>

1568
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:53,334
Hans!

1569
02:00:07,493 --> 02:00:09,723
Jesus.

1570
02:00:09,829 --> 02:00:11,660
Hi, honey.

1571
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:36,314
So that's what this
is all about?

1572
02:00:36,423 --> 02:00:37,822
A fucking robbery?

1573
02:00:37,925 --> 02:00:39,756
Put down the gun.

1574
02:00:39,860 --> 02:00:43,796
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

1575
02:00:43,897 --> 02:00:45,797
Well, when
you steal $600,

1576
02:00:45,899 --> 02:00:46,923
you can disappear.

1577
02:00:47,034 --> 02:00:48,934
When you steal
600 million,

1578
02:00:49,036 --> 02:00:50,003
they'll find you...

1579
02:00:50,104 --> 02:00:52,504
unless they think
you're already dead.

1580
02:00:52,606 --> 02:00:54,472
Put down the gun.

1581
02:01:01,416 --> 02:01:03,475
Uh.

1582
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:06,610
<i>Nein. This is mine.</i>

1583
02:01:08,723 --> 02:01:10,657
You got me.

1584
02:01:10,759 --> 02:01:14,718
<i>Still the cowboy,
Mr. McClane.</i>

1585
02:01:14,829 --> 02:01:16,228
Americans, all alike.

1586
02:01:16,331 --> 02:01:18,959
This time, John Wayne doesn't
walk off into the sunset...

1587
02:01:19,067 --> 02:01:20,500
with Grace Kelly.

1588
02:01:20,602 --> 02:01:22,433
That was Gary Cooper,
asshole.

1589
02:01:22,537 --> 02:01:24,301
Enough jokes.

1590
02:01:24,407 --> 02:01:25,806
You'd have made...

1591
02:01:25,908 --> 02:01:27,273
a good cowboy
yourself, Hans.

1592
02:01:27,376 --> 02:01:28,775
Oh, yeah.

1593
02:01:28,878 --> 02:01:32,006
What was it you said
to me before?

1594
02:01:32,114 --> 02:01:35,606
Yippee-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

1595
02:01:56,673 --> 02:01:57,935
Holly!

1596
02:02:02,746 --> 02:02:04,941
Happy trails, Hans.

1597
02:02:10,153 --> 02:02:11,120
Aah!

1598
02:02:11,221 --> 02:02:12,119
Holly.

1599
02:02:14,191 --> 02:02:16,318
Aah!

1600
02:02:49,494 --> 02:02:51,553
I hope that's
not a hostage.

1601
02:03:19,892 --> 02:03:23,385
<i>Water hook-up
companies 93, 96-</i>

1602
02:03:23,496 --> 02:03:25,157
<i>Must have burned down
the whole building.</i>

1603
02:03:27,267 --> 02:03:29,667
Over here.
It's a better angle.

1604
02:03:29,769 --> 02:03:31,600
Let's give them...

1605
02:03:33,706 --> 02:03:36,607
Keep it going, now.
Keep it going.

1606
02:03:42,215 --> 02:03:44,615
Come on.
We're going to miss it!

1607
02:03:44,717 --> 02:03:46,617
Okay.
Hand me my notes!

1608
02:04:06,507 --> 02:04:07,906
Come on, folks.

1609
02:04:08,008 --> 02:04:10,408
What was it like
in there?

1610
02:04:10,511 --> 02:04:12,775
How did they
treat you?

1611
02:04:58,361 --> 02:05:00,761
Al, this is
my wife Holly.

1612
02:05:00,863 --> 02:05:02,262
Holly Gennero.

1613
02:05:02,365 --> 02:05:03,764
Holly McClane.

1614
02:05:03,866 --> 02:05:05,629
Hello, Holly.

1615
02:05:05,735 --> 02:05:08,135
You got yourself
a good man.

1616
02:05:08,237 --> 02:05:10,603
You take
good care of him.

1617
02:05:11,874 --> 02:05:13,364
<i>McClane!</i>

1618
02:05:13,476 --> 02:05:15,376
McClane,
I want a debriefing!

1619
02:05:15,478 --> 02:05:16,877
You got some things...

1620
02:05:16,979 --> 02:05:18,378
to answer for,
mister-

1621
02:05:18,481 --> 02:05:20,745
Ellis' murder,
for one thing,

1622
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:22,113
<i>property damage,</i>

1623
02:05:22,219 --> 02:05:24,619
<i>interfering with
police business.</i>

1624
02:06:03,661 --> 02:06:06,596
<i>All right!
Two of you go inside...</i>

1625
02:06:06,698 --> 02:06:09,098
<i>- and see if there's
anybody else! - Yes, sir-</i>

1626
02:06:19,377 --> 02:06:21,278
This one's with me.

1627
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:32,789
Mr. McClane.
Mr. McClane!

1628
02:06:32,891 --> 02:06:35,587
After this
incredible ordeal,

1629
02:06:35,694 --> 02:06:37,719
what are
your feelings?

1630
02:06:41,700 --> 02:06:44,726
Well, well, well.

1631
02:06:44,837 --> 02:06:46,737
Merry Christmas,
Argyle.

1632
02:06:46,839 --> 02:06:48,067
Merry Christmas.

1633
02:06:51,010 --> 02:06:53,240
Did you get that?

1634
02:06:53,346 --> 02:06:54,745
Let me through.

1635
02:06:54,848 --> 02:06:57,749
If this is their idea
of Christmas,

1636
02:06:57,851 --> 02:07:00,752
I got to be here
for New Year's.

1637
02:07:04,758 --> 02:07:08,216
<i># Oh, the weather outside
is frightful #</i>

1638
02:07:08,328 --> 02:07:12,094
<i># But the fire
is so delightful #</i>

1639
02:07:12,198 --> 02:07:16,032
<i># And since we've
no place to go #</i>

1640
02:07:16,136 --> 02:07:20,102
<i># Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow #</i>

1641
02:07:20,206 --> 02:07:23,574
<i># It doesn't show signs
of stopping #</i>

1642
02:07:23,677 --> 02:07:27,272
<i># And I brought
some corn for popping #</i>

1643
02:07:27,381 --> 02:07:31,010
<i># The lights are turned
way down low #</i>

1644
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:34,713
<i># Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow #</i>

1645
02:07:34,822 --> 02:07:38,519
<i># When we finally
kiss good night #</i>

1646
02:07:38,626 --> 02:07:42,357
<i># How I hate goin'out
in the storm #</i>

1647
02:07:42,463 --> 02:07:46,559
<i># But if you
really hold me tight #</i>

1648
02:07:46,667 --> 02:07:50,296
<i># All the way home,
I'll be warm #</i>

1649
02:07:50,405 --> 02:07:53,238
<i># The fire is slowly dying #</i>

1650
02:07:53,341 --> 02:07:57,641
<i># And, my dear,
we're still good-byeing #</i>

1651
02:07:57,746 --> 02:08:01,113
<i># But as long as you
love me so #</i>

1652
02:08:01,216 --> 02:08:03,150
<i># Let it snow #</i>

1653
02:08:03,251 --> 02:08:05,185
<i># Let it snow #</i>

1654
02:08:05,287 --> 02:08:11,182
<i># Let it snow ##</i>
