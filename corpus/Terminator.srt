1
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,919
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

2
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,959
What the hell...?

3
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,439
Hey, my turn.

4
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,799
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

5
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,799
Nice night for a walk?

6
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,879
Nice night for a walk.

7
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,199
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

8
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,919
Nothing clean. Right.

9
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,119
I think this guy's a couple of cans
short of a six-pack.

10
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,959
Your clothes, give them to me. Now.

11
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,639
Fuck you, asshole.

12
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,359
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

13
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,479
See that guy?

14
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,759
Hold it right there.

15
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,759
- He's rabbiting.
- Hey! I said hold it!

16
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,079
Go!

17
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,599
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

18
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,479
- What day is it? The date.
- 12th May.

19
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,439
- Thursday.
- What year?

20
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,959
He's got my gun. Let's go.

21
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,519
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

22
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,999
Hi. I'm late.

23
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,599
So am I.

24
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,079
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

25
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,799
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.

26
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,359
- OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
- I ordered barbecued.

27
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,559
I think that's mine,
but I didn't order fries.

28
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,439
- Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
- OK, who gets the burly-beef?

29
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,439
- Miss, we're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

30
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,439
I'm so sorry.

31
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,479
This isn't real leather, is it?

32
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,959
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

33
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,119
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

34
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,679
The 12-gauge auto-loader.

35
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,679
That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.

36
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,399
The .45 long slide with laser sighting.

37
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,879
These are new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

38
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,319
Just touch the trigger,
the beam comes on,

39
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,319
and you put the red dot where
you want the bullet to go.

40
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,999
You can't miss.

41
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,999
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

42
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,799
Hey, just what you see, pal.

43
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,319
The Uzi nine millimeter.

44
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,119
You know your weapons, buddy.

45
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,479
Any one of these
is ideal for home defense.

46
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,679
So which will it be?

47
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,359
- All.
- I may close early today.

48
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,839
It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take now.

49
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,039
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

50
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,839
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

51
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,319
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

52
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,719
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

53
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,519
Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

54
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,959
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

55
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,999
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

56
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,559
Sarah, come here. It's about you.
I mean, sort of.

57
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,359
So incredible. You're not gonna believe
this. Sit, you're going to love this.

58
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,639
- What?
<i>- ...compiled from several witnesses.</i>

59
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,999
<i>Once again, Sarah Connor,</i>
<i>35, mother of two,</i>

60
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,479
<i>brutally shot to death</i>
<i>in her home this afternoon.</i>

61
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,439
You're dead, honey.

62
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,839
<i>...if you're into sound,</i>

63
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,359
<i>for the greatest sound around,</i>
<i>come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.</i>

64
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,759
<i>We've got woofers, tweeters,</i>
<i>the newest in audio and compact discs.</i>

65
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,399
<i>We've got graphic equalizers</i>
<i>and sound balancers that...</i>

66
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,239
Sorry.

67
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,079
Hello?

68
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,279
<i>First I'm gonna rip the buttons</i>
<i>off your blouse one by one,</i>

69
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,879
<i>then run my tongue down your neck</i>
<i>to your bare, gleaming breasts.</i>

70
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,759
<i>And then slowly... slowly pull</i>
<i>your jeans off inch by inch.</i>

71
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,679
Ginger, it's Matt.

72
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,759
And lick your belly in circles
further and further down,

73
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,199
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.

74
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,639
Who is this?

75
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,239
God. Sarah?

76
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,039
<i>Jesus. I'm sorry.</i>

77
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,999
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger, please?

78
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,719
Sure.

79
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,959
It's the creep.

80
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,639
Hello?

81
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,319
First I'll rip the buttons off
your blouse one by one...

82
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,239
You fucking pigs! Wait till I get
my hands on you. Get off me!

83
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,519
Ed.

84
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,839
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.

85
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,519
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

86
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,519
Shot six times at less than ten feet.
Large caliber weapon.

87
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,479
You know, these work.

88
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,519
- What's this?
- Dead girl two.

89
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,359
Sent over from the Valley division
this afternoon.

90
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,599
Are you sure there's
a point to all of this?

91
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,799
Look at the name, Ed.

92
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,119
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

93
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,999
You're kidding me.

94
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,759
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

95
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,239
- A one-day pattern killer.
- I hate the weird ones.

96
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,719
So...

97
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,519
Better than mortal man deserves.

98
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,159
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately. Did you check messages?

99
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,159
I thought you did.

100
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,799
<i>- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...</i>
- There you are, young man.

101
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,119
You mind your mother.

102
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,879
<i>Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.</i>
<i>Something's come up.</i>

103
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,319
<i>Looks like I won't be able to make it</i>
<i>tonight. Just can't get out of it.</i>

104
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,239
<i>I'm really sorry. I'll make it up</i>
<i>to you. Call you in a day or so. Bye.</i>

105
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,399
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

106
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,039
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

107
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,119
I'll live.

108
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,359
I'll break his kneecaps.

109
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,439
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

110
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,679
God. It's disgusting.

111
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,479
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.

112
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,559
- We will. You, too.
- OK.

113
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,719
Damn it, Matt.

114
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,239
- Oh, shit.
- Lieutenant!

115
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,919
These killings occurred in the order
of their listings in the phone book.

116
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,999
- What can I tell you? No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...

117
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,559
That coffee's two hours cold.

118
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,719
I put a cigarette out in it.

119
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,239
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I got her answering machine.

120
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,679
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit. There's no answer.

121
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,039
- The apartment manager's not in.
- Call her.

122
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,399
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

123
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,119
Give me a cigarette.

124
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,079
<i>Hi, there. Fooled you.</i>
<i>You're talking to a machine.</i>

125
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,919
<i>But don't be shy. It's OK. Machines need</i>
<i>love, too, so talk to it...</i>

126
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,719
Same shit.

127
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,159
I can hear it now. He's gonna be
called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

128
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,559
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

129
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,519
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.

130
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,879
Maybe make these jackals work for us
for a change.

131
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,559
If I can get on the tube by 11:00,
maybe she'll call us.

132
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,319
Well, how do I look?

133
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,799
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.

134
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,079
<i>This just in. Police have announced</i>
<i>the name of the victim</i>

135
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,319
<i>in the second of two execution</i>
<i>style murders which took place today.</i>

136
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,279
<i>Incredibly, the names of the</i>
<i>two victims are virtually identical.</i>

137
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,959
<i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann</i>
<i>Connor was pronounced dead...</i>

138
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,919
- Can we change this?
<i>- Sarah Louise Connor...</i>

139
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,679
Don't touch it!

140
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,319
<i>Police are refusing to speculate on the</i>
<i>similarity between the shooting deaths</i>

141
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,559
<i>and no other connection between the</i>
<i>two victims has been established yet.</i>

142
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,119
<i>We'll have more on this</i>
<i>late-breaking story as it comes in.</i>

143
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,559
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back.

144
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,999
Hey, $4.50.

145
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,479
<i>You have reached the Los Angeles</i>
<i>Police Department emergency number.</i>

146
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,439
<i>All lines are busy. If you need a police</i>
<i>car sent out to you, stay on the line.</i>

147
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,079
Pugsley! Shoo!

148
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,879
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

149
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,519
Don't make me bust you up, man.

150
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,879
<i>Hi, there. Fooled you.</i>
<i>You're talking to a machine.</i>

151
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,919
<i>But don't be shy. It's OK.</i>
<i>Machines need love, too.</i>

152
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,039
<i>So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,</i>
<i>or Sarah will get back to you.</i>

153
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,719
<i>Wait for the beep.</i>

154
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,159
<i>Ginger, this is Sarah.</i>
<i>Pick up if you're there.</i>

155
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,199
<i>I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard</i>
<i>called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.</i>

156
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,279
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

157
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,559
I need you and Matt to come
and pick me up as soon as possible.

158
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,439
The police keep transferring me around.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

159
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,879
<i>The number here is 555-9175.</i>

160
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,959
<i>Call me, kiddo. I need your help.</i>

161
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,399
<i>It's her.</i>

162
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,879
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

163
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,319
Lieutenant, don't put me on hold and
don't transfer me to another department.

164
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,959
Don't worry, I won't. Just relax.
Can you tell me where you are?

165
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,999
<i>- I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.</i>
- Yeah, I know it. It's on Pico.

166
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,679
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

167
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,719
- I think there's a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.

168
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,279
You're in a public place so
you'll be safe till we get there.

169
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,759
But stay visible. Don't go outside
or even to the restroom.

170
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,679
<i>- I'll have a car there in a minute.</i>
- OK.

171
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,879
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

172
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,599
Come with me if you wanna live.

173
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,719
Come on!

174
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,599
This is one-L-19.
I got a hit-and-run felony.

175
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,119
Suspect vehicle: late model
gray Ford headed westbound on Seventh.

176
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,599
He's really moving,
punching lights all the way.

177
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,559
I'm gonna need an ambulance
at Seventh and Broadway right now.

178
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,959
Hold it!

179
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,999
Hold on.

180
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,639
Are you injured? Are you shot?

181
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,559
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

182
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,279
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

183
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,879
Do you understand?

184
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,399
- Do you understand?
- Yes! Please don't hurt me.

185
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,359
I'm here to help you.

186
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,119
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416. Assigned to protect you.

187
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,999
You've been targeted for termination.

188
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,559
This is one-L-19. Westbound
on Olympic, approaching Overland.

189
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,679
This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.

190
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,559
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

191
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,119
This isn't true. How could that man
just get up after you...

192
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,639
It's not a man. A machine.

193
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,759
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.

194
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,879
A machine? Like a robot?

195
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,559
Not a robot. A cyborg.
Cybernetic organism.

196
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,639
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

197
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,039
Get your head down!

198
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,079
All right, listen.

199
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,639
The Terminator's an infiltration unit.
Part man, part machine.

200
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,879
Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat
chassis. Microprocessor controlled.

201
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,679
Fully armored, very tough.
But outside it's living human tissue.

202
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,959
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

203
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,639
- Look, Reese, I don't know...
- Pay attention.

204
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,119
I gotta ditch this car.

205
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,919
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

206
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,559
But these are new. They look human.

207
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,359
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

208
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,199
I had to wait till he moved on you
before I could zero him.

209
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,839
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.

210
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,079
Not yet. Not for about 40 years.

211
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,599
Are you saying it's from the future?

212
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,879
One possible future.

213
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,159
From your point of view,
I don't know tech stuff.

214
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,519
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

215
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,839
- Right.
- Right.

216
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:58,399
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

217
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,399
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.

218
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,319
That Terminator is out there.

219
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,159
It can't be bargained with,
it can't be reasoned with.

220
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,039
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear

221
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,079
and it absolutely will not stop,
ever, until you are dead.

222
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,119
Can you stop it?

223
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,719
I don't know.

224
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,839
With these weapons, I don't know.

225
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,639
<i>All units. Ford suspect vehicle has</i>
<i>been found in a parking structure...</i>

226
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,599
Reese, why me?

227
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,199
Why does it want me?

228
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,999
There was a nuclear war.

229
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,799
A few years from now...

230
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,279
...all this, this whole place,
everything...

231
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,759
...it's gone. Just gone.

232
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,519
There were survivors.

233
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,679
Here, there.

234
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,959
Nobody even knew who started it.

235
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,359
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don't understand.

236
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,679
Defense network computers.

237
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,999
New, powerful...

238
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,439
...hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.

239
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,639
They say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.

240
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,559
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

241
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,359
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

242
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,799
Extermination.

243
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,679
Did you see this war?

244
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,879
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

245
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,119
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

246
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,279
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-killers.

247
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,199
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

248
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,639
Most of us were rounded up,
put in camps for orderly disposal.

249
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,959
This was burned in by laser scanner.

250
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,479
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

251
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,799
Loading bodies.

252
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,639
The disposal units ran night and day.

253
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,679
We were that close
to going out forever.

254
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,639
But there was one man
who taught us to fight.

255
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,719
To storm the wire of the camps.

256
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,199
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

257
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,559
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

258
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,999
His name was Connor. John Connor.

259
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,639
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

260
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,399
Drive!

261
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,799
Reese!

262
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,199
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

263
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,199
You in the Cadillac,
let me see your hands now.

264
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,359
Get out of the car.

265
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,319
Drop to your knees.

266
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,119
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

267
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,359
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

268
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,519
Listen, are you sure it's them?

269
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,479
I mean,
maybe I should look at the bodies.

270
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,519
No. They've been identified
and there's no doubt.

271
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,239
Ginger.

272
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,319
- Kiddo.
- Sarah...

273
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,639
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

274
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,839
I want you to tell him everything
Reese told you. Do you feel up to that?

275
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,119
Yeah, I guess so.

276
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,719
- You're a doctor?
- Criminal psychologist.

277
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,119
- Is Reese crazy?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

278
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,839
So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

279
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:13,359
With the 132nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

280
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,639
That's the year 2027?

281
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,879
<i>That's right. Then I was assigned...</i>

282
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,679
- This is fucking great.
<i>- ...under John Connor.</i>

283
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,919
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defense system built...

284
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,639
Goddamn. Sorry.

285
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,159
...built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

286
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,279
I see.

287
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:40,319
And this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

288
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,679
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

289
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,959
A sort of retroactive abortion?

290
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,999
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

291
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,679
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.

292
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,159
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

293
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,879
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

294
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,119
It had no choice.
Their defense grid was smashed.

295
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,719
We'd won. Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

296
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,679
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

297
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,879
Is that when you captured the lab
complex and found... What is it called?

298
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,239
The time displacement equipment?

299
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,439
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

300
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,479
Connor sent me to intercept
and they blew the whole place.

301
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,479
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

302
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,079
I can't.

303
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:37,159
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

304
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,999
It's just him and me.

305
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,279
<i>It's just him and me.</i>

306
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:36,319
<i>Why didn't you bring any weapons?</i>
<i>Something more advanced.</i>

307
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,439
<i>Don't you have ray guns?</i>

308
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,279
- Ray guns.
<i>- Show me a piece of future technology.</i>

309
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,839
<i>You go naked. Something about the</i>
<i>field generated by a living organism.</i>

310
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,039
<i>- Nothing dead will go.</i>
<i>- Why?</i>

311
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,879
<i>I didn't build the fucking thing.</i>

312
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,799
<i>OK, OK. But this cyborg,</i>
<i>if it's metal...?</i>

313
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,399
<i>- Surrounded by living tissue.</i>
<i>- Oh, right.</i>

314
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,919
This is great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.

315
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,879
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.

316
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,519
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant.

317
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,839
<i>- Why were the other two women killed?</i>
<i>- Most records were lost in the war.</i>

318
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,559
<i>Skynet knew almost nothing</i>
<i>about Connor's mother.</i>

319
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,159
<i>Her full name, where she lived.</i>
<i>They just knew the city.</i>

320
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,399
<i>The Terminator was</i>
<i>just being systematic.</i>

321
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,439
<i>- Let's go back...</i>
<i>- Look, you have heard enough.</i>

322
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,559
<i>I have answered your questions,</i>
<i>now I have to see Sarah Connor.</i>

323
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,679
<i>- I'm afraid that's not up to me.</i>
<i>- Then why am I talking to you?</i>

324
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,679
<i>- Who is in authority here?</i>
<i>- Please...</i>

325
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,399
<i>Shut up!</i>

326
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,759
<i>You still don't get it, do you?</i>

327
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,039
<i>He'll find her. That's what he does.</i>
<i>That's all he does.</i>

328
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,959
<i>You can't stop him.</i>

329
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,719
<i>He'll reach down her throat</i>
<i>and pull her fucking heart out!</i>

330
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,879
- Doc.
<i>- Let go of me!</i>

331
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,319
Sorry.

332
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,119
So Reese is crazy?

333
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,799
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

334
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:18,079
Sarah, this is what they call
body armor. Our TAC guys wear these.

335
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,399
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

336
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,759
This other individual must've
been wearing one under his coat.

337
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,599
Feel that. Go ahead.

338
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,479
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.

339
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,319
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it for hours.

340
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,079
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

341
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,639
- Here.
- Thank you.

342
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,839
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.

343
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,319
Be at least an hour before
your mother gets here from Big Bear.

344
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,599
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

345
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,999
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

346
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,799
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

347
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,919
Thank you.

348
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,239
- Good night.
- Good night.

349
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,719
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

350
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,039
No. Can't see her.
She's making a statement.

351
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,319
Where is she?

352
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,079
It may take a while. If you wanna wait,
there's a bench over there.

353
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,159
I'll be back.

354
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,159
- Are they terrorists?
- Let's go, let's go!

355
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,199
Stay here.

356
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,959
Let's get outta here!

357
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,519
Watch him.

358
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,719
Ed...

359
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,919
Hey!

360
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,079
Sarah!

361
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,759
Reese.

362
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,839
This way.

363
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,319
<i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>

364

Take this.

368
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,439
All right,
let's get this off the road.

369
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,319
- You cold?
- Freezing.

370
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,479
Reese?

371
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:12,079
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.

372
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,559
Kyle, what's it like
when you go through time?

373
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,239
White light.

374
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,039
Pain.

375
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,559
- It's like being born maybe.
- Oh, my God.

376
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,399
I caught one back there.

377
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,759
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

378
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,079
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

379
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,919
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

380
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,199
Jesus.

381
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,239
See? It passed right through the meat.

382
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,039
This is gonna make me puke.

383
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,559
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

384
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,199
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

385
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,599
He's about my height.

386
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,279
He has your eyes.

387
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,199
What's he like?

388
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,679
You trust him. He's got a strength.

389
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,239
I'd die for John Connor.

390
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,799
Well, at least now I know
what to name him.

391
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,719
Don't suppose you know who the father is
so I won't tell him to get lost?

392
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,639
John never said much about him.

393
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,319
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.

394
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,039
I don't wanna know.

395
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,039
So was it John that sent you here?

396
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,279
I volunteered.

397
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,319
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.

398
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:18,239
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organize,

399
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,519
prepare from when he was a kid.

400
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,719
When you were in hiding before the war.

401
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,279
You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

402
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,319
It's driving me crazy.

403
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,959
Are you sure you have the right person?

404
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,159
I'm sure.

405
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:45,039
Come on. Do I look like
the mother of the future?

406
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,719
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook.

407
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:58,639
Look, Reese, I didn't ask
for this honor and I don't want it.

408
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,239
Any of it.

409
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:07,759
Your son gave me a message
to give to you. Made me memorize it.

410
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,799
"Thank you, Sarah,
for your courage through the dark years.

411
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,119
I can't help you with
what you must soon face,

412
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,559
except to say the future is not set.

413
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,239
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

414
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,919
You must survive or I will never exist."

415
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,719
That's all.

416
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,199
It's a good field dressing.

417
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,239
You like it?

418
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,399
It's my first.

419
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,079
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.

420
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,599
OK.

421
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,199
Talk to me some more.

422
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,999
About what?

423
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,319
Tell me about where you're from.

424
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,279
All right.

425
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,719
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.

426
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,799
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

427
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,959
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

428
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,679
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

429
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,879
The Terminators were the newest.

430
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,439
<i>The worst.</i>

431
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:51,079
<i>Traversing your sector in search mode.</i>
<i>750 meters north of your position.</i>

432
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,159
Let's go.

433
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,599
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

434
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,959
Terminator!

435
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,559
I was dreaming about dogs.

436
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,199
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

437
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,799
Your world is pretty terrifying.

438
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,519
Hey, buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

439
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,039
Fuck you, asshole.

440
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,719
God damn.

441
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,279
Thank you.

442
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,159
Is this enough?

443
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,999
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

444
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,839
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

445
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,999
- All right.
- With a kitchen.

446
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,639
Do you have one with a kitchen?

447
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,519
I am dying for a shower.

448
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,319
We should check your bandage, too.

449
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,559
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

450
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,439
Keep this.

451
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:25,879
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

452
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,239
<i>But I need to know where to reach you.</i>

453
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:33,519
<i>You tell me to hide out at the cabin</i>
<i>and you won't tell me what's going on?</i>

454
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,439
<i>I am worried sick here.</i>

455
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,359
OK. OK, here's the number.

456
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,719
<i>- You ready?</i>
- Yes. Go ahead.

457
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:49,599
<i>It's 408-555-1439. Room nine.</i>

458
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,479
<i>- Got it?</i>
- I've got it.

459
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:55,839
<i>I gotta go. I'm sorry</i>
<i>I can't tell you more right now.</i>

460
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,759
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

461
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,119
I love you, too, sweetheart.

462
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,439
<i>- Tiki Motel.</i>
- Give me your address there.

463
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,199
What have we got?

464
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:33,039
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.

465
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,839
What's for dinner?

466
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:38,639
- Plastique.
- That sounds good.

467
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,159
What is it?

468
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,639
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

469
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,679
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

470
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,679
Make sure there's none on the threads.

471
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,319
Like this.

472
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,079
Screw the end cap on.

473
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,519
Very gently.

474
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,599
You must've had a fun childhood.

475
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,679
That's good.

476
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,679
All right. Six more like that
and I'll get started on the fuses.

477
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,119
He'll find us, won't he?

478
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,599
Probably.

479
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,839
It'll never be over, will it?

480
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,279
Look at me. I'm shaking.

481
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:20,559
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

482
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:25,559
No, I'm not.

483
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:39,599
Kyle, the women in your time,

484
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,839
what are they like?

485
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,999
Good fighters.

486
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,199
That's not what I meant.

487
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,239
Was there someone special?

488
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,799
Someone...?

489
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,599
A girl, you know.

490
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,479
No.

491
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,919
Never.

492
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,119
Never?

493
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,439
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

494
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,399
So much pain.

495
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:28,119
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

496
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,559
So you feel nothing?

497
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,639
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

498
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,359
I didn't know why at the time.

499
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:49,639
It was very old, torn, faded.

500
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:59,479
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

501
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,799
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.

502
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,479
I memorized every line...

503
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,839
...every curve.

504
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,439
I came across time for you, Sarah.

505
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:22,639
I love you. I always have.

506
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,359
I shouldn't have said that.

507
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:14,479
Think fast.

508
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,839
Trade places.

509
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,199
Faster! Drive faster!

510
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:53,279
Kyle! Oh, my God.

511
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,879
Kyle.

512
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,519
Son-of-a-bitch!

513
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,199
You stay here.

514
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,359
Let's get outta here.

515
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,279
Get out.

516
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,359
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

517
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,479
Kyle, come on.

518
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,479
Help me! Get out. Get out.

519
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,919
Don't stop. Run!

520
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,639
Sarah!

521
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,279
Kyle.

522
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,119
Kyle. Kyle...

523
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:02,959
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

524
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:25,639
No!

525
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,799
Wait.

526
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,279
What are you doing?

527
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,319
Cover, so he can't track us.

528
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:46,199
Come on! Come on.

529
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:50,039
No, Kyle! Come on!

530
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,559
- Come on!
- Leave me here.

531
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:08,039
Move it, Reese! On your feet, soldier!

532
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,559
On your feet!

533
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,359
Move it!

534
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,719
Get back. Go back.

535
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:02,039
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

536
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:08,919
Run!

537
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,039
Come on, motherfucker.

538
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,199
No.

539
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:06,359
You're terminated, fucker.

540
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:05,799
Kyle.

541
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:30,839
Tape seven. November 10. Where was I?

542
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:35,639
What's most difficult is trying to
decide what to tell you and what not to.

543
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:40,359
But I guess I have a while before you're
old enough to understand these tapes.

544
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:44,279
They're more for me at this point
just so that I can get it straight.

545
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,719
Fill her up.

546
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,519
Should I tell you about your father?

547
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:31,919
Boy, that's a tough one.

548
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:37,999
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

549
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,999
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

550
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,239
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

551
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,799
I suppose I will tell you.

552
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:55,399
I owe him that.

553
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,159
Maybe it'll help if...

554
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:05,759
...you know that in the few hours
that we had together...

555
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,839
...we loved a lifetime's worth.

556
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:26,559
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful.

557
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:29,599
He is ashamed to ask you for five
American dollars for this picture.

558
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:33,199
But if he doesn't,
his father will beat him.

559
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:35,079
Pretty good hustle, kid.

560
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,999
What did he just say?

561
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,839
He said there's a storm coming in.

562
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,879
I know.
