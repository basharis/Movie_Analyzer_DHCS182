1
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,524
How you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:41,905
I can't feel my legs...

3
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,367
Keyser.

4
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:51,247
Ready?

5
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:04,093
What time is it?

6
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,721
Twelve-thirty.

7
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,205
It all started back in New York
six weeks ago.

8
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,585
A truck of stripped guns parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

9
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,088
The driver didn't see anybody,
but he heard a voice.

10
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,798
Sometimes that's all you need.

11
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:32,098
- Mr. McManus.
- Don't you guys ever fucking sleep?

12
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,310
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

13
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,569
Todd Hockney?

14
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,198
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

15
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:55,455
- Shit!
- Police! Hold it!

16
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,921
Sure you brought enough guys?

17
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:39,582
It's quite simple,

18
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:44,504
a restaurant that changes with taste
without losing the overall aesthetic.

19
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:48,842
On other words, the atmosphere
will not be painted on the walls.

20
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:52,011
Let me give you an example.

21
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,347
This I had to see for myself.

22
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,479
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

23
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,858
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

24
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,569
Special Agent Kujan, U.S. Customs.

25
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:10,822
And the New York Police Dept.

26
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,409
You look good, Keaton.

27
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:19,747
- You have a problem, Mr. Keaton?
- A stolen truck loaded with guns.

28
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:26,504
Will you excuse us for a moment?

29
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:31,342
We have some questions.
It's going to be some time.

30
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,763
No, no, please sit down.

31
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:39,100
This is a small problem.

32
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,144
Enjoy the meal.

33
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,729
Talk to you later.

34
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:10,131
<i>It didn't make sense I was there.
They were hard-core hijackers.</i>

35
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,842
<i>But there I was.</i>

36
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:19,974
<i>I wasn't scared. I hadn't done
anything they could do me for.</i>

37
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:25,438
<i>Besides, it was fun.
I got to make like I was notorious.</i>

38
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,359
<i>When your number is called,</i>

39
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:32,529
<i>step forward and repeat
the phrase you've been given.</i>

40
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,615
<i>Number 1, step forward.</i>

41
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:42,497
Hand me the keys, you cocksucker.

42
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,085
<i>Number 2, step forward.</i>

43
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,799
Give me the fucking keys,
you cocksucker motherfucker!

44
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:56,886
<i>Knock it off. Number 3.</i>

45
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:09,357
<i>- Hand me the keys, cocksucker.
- In English, please.</i>

46
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:12,735
<i>- Excuse me?
- In English.</i>

47
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:15,655
Hand me the keys, cocksucker.
What the fuck?

48
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:18,158
<i>Number 4, step forward.</i>

49
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:21,286
<i>The whole rap was a setup.</i>

50
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:24,247
Hand me the keys, you cocksucker.

51
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:28,710
<i>It was the cops'fault. You don't
put guys like that together.</i>

52
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:31,421
<i>Who knows what can happen?</i>

53
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:35,383
Hand me the keys, you cocksucker.

54
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:37,760
<i>This has got to be</i>

55
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,596
embarrassing for you guys.

56
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:44,100
<i>They drilled us all night.
The cops had nothing.</i>

57
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:47,228
<i>They hoped somebody'd slip up.</i>

58
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:51,566
<i>They knew we wouldn't fight it.
They knew how to lean on us.</i>

59
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:55,528
<i>Our rights went out the window,
it was disgraceful.</i>

60
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,323
<i>They went after McManus first.
Top-knotch entry man.</i>

61
00:09:58,656 --> 00:10:02,118
- What truck?
- The truck with the guns, fucko.

62
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,204
Fucko?

63
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:09,083
<i>He was a good guy.
Crazy, though.</i>

64
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,127
Want to know what Fenster said?

65
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:14,923
McManus told us another story.

66
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,510
Was that the one about
the hooker with dysentery?

67
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:21,846
<i>Fenster always worked
with McManus.</i>

68
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:25,141
<i>When it came to the job
he was right on. A smart man.</i>

69
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:27,894
- What are you saying?
- I said you're flip here.

70
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:31,022
- What?
- Flip here, flipping for real.

71
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:32,607
I'm shaking. Come on.

72
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:36,069
- Answer my question.
- Can you hear me at the back?

73
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:43,243
I want my lawyer.
I'll have your badge, cocksucker.

74
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,621
<i>Todd Hockney.
Good with explosives.</i>

75
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:50,375
<i>The one guy who didn't
give a fuck about anybody.</i>

76
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:54,671
- You don't have a leg to stand on.
- You think so, tough guy?

77
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:57,173
You were in Queens on the night
of the highjacking.

78
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,717
Really? I live in Queens.

79
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:05,098
Did you put that together, Einstein?
You got a team of monkeys?

80
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,017
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

81
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,482
Fuck your father in the shower.
You gonna charge me, dickhead?

82
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:16,317
I'll charge you when I'm ready.

83
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:19,237
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

84
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:22,991
<i>Keaton was the real prize
for them, for obvious reasons.</i>

85
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:25,702
It was your mistake, not mine.

86
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,748
Did you ever stop to ask me?

87
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:36,087
I have the same face, the same name.

88
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:40,758
- I'm a businessman.
- The restaurant business?

89
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:44,929
From now on, you're in the
getting-fucked-by-us business.

90
00:11:45,263 --> 00:11:49,100
- I'm going to make you famous.
- Like I said,

91
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,062
it was your mistake, not mine.

92
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:58,651
Charge me with this shit,
and I'll beat it.

93
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:01,154
Okay?

94
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,365
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

95
00:12:06,534 --> 00:12:10,955
I hold someone's shit
for five minutes.

96
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:14,292
So I did a little time.
Does that mean I get railed

97
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:17,253
every time a truck loses its way?

98
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,797
Fuck 'em!

99
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:23,384
Fenster, will you relax?
They don't have probable cause.

100
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,763
Fucking -A right. No P.C.

101
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,015
You do some time,
they never let you go.

102
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,059
They treat me like a criminal.

103
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,269
I'll end up a criminal.

104
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,938
You are a criminal.

105
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:40,193
What you got to do that?
I'm trying to make a point.

106
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:44,447
Why don't you make your point?
You're making me tired all over.

107
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:46,449
Fuck it, then.

108
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,576
I heard you were dead.

109
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,537
You heard right.

110
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,455
Word I got is you
hung up your spurs.

111
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,124
What's that all about?

112
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,667
What's this?

113
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,044
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.

114
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,964
I hear he's tapping Edie Finnerman.

115
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:02,006
Who's that?

116
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:06,344
A big uptown criminal lawyer.
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

117
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:10,223
How about it? You a lawyer's wife?

118
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,309
What retainer are you giving her?

119
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,396
Fenster,

120
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:18,648
do your friend a favor.

121
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:21,234
Tell him to keep quiet.

122
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:23,945
Dean Keaton.

123
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,950
Gone clean, huh?
Say it ain't so.

124
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:32,537
- Or did you hit the truck?
- Mac, forget him.

125
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:34,789
Did you talk to your lawyer?

126
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:37,750
This was a shakedown.

127
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:41,296
- What makes you say that?
- You've been in a lineup.

128
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,215
It's always you
and four dummies.

129
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:48,011
The P.D. Pays homeless guys
ten bucks a head.

130
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:51,556
No way they'd line five felons
in a row. No way.

131
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,518
A voice lineup? A public defender
could get you out of that.

132
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:58,688
- So why was I strip-searched?
- It was the Feds.

133
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,441
A truckload of guns gets snagged,

134
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:05,528
Customs goes to NYPD,
they come up with us.

135
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,032
- They're clutching at straws.
- I had a guy's finger up my asshole.

136
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,366
Is it Friday already?

137
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:13,703
Yeah, lover boy.

138
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,164
You want a piece?

139
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:20,460
Who are the pigs
stole our fucking truck?

140
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:24,714
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

141
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:26,257
I don't want to know.

142
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,595
- Who asked you, working man?
- Fuck who did it. Who's the gimp?

143
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:33,014
- He's okay.
- Says you.

144
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:34,516
What about it, pretzel man?

145
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:36,643
- What's your story?
- His name is Verbal.

146
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:38,520
Verbal Kint.

147
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:43,358
Roger, really. People say
I talk too much.

148
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:45,568
I was going to tell you to shut up.

149
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,237
We met before once or twice.

150
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:49,364
I was in county for fraud.

151
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:51,491
In a lineup. What happened?

152
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,827
I walked.

153
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:56,079
- 90 days suspended.
- So you did it!

154
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:57,455
All right, look.

155
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:01,376
We've been put out by this.

156
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,255
I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

157
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,590
Now...

158
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,676
Me and Fenster heard about a job.

159
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:11,302
Why don't you just calm down?

160
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,847
What do you care what he says?

161
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,724
I'm just talking here.

162
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:22,105
Mr. Hockney wants to hear,
and I know Fenster's down.

163
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,524
What about you, guy?

164
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:27,861
I'm interested, sure.

165
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,113
There. See?

166
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:33,408
So I'd like to exercise my
right to free assembly.

167
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,743
Why don't you just shut up?

168
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:43,418
You're missing the point.

169
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,505
No. You're missing the point.

170
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:50,800
I don't want to hear
anything from you.

171
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:53,136
I don't care about your job.

172
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,347
And...

173
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:02,228
I want nothing to do with
any of you. I beg your pardon,

174
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:04,898
but you can all go to hell.

175
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,610
Dean Keaton,

176
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,029
gone the high road.

177
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,741
What is the world coming to?

178
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:20,997
Fuck him.

179
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,003
<i>And that was how it started.</i>

180
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,549
<i>The five of us on a trumped-up
charge to be leaned on by halfwits.</i>

181
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,930
I can't talk about much here.

182
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,475
<i>What the cops didn't figure out
and what I know now,</i>

183
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:44,437
<i>was these men would never break.</i>

184
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,315
<i>Never bend over for anybody.</i>

185
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,235
<i>Anybody.</i>

186
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,920
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, F.B.I.

187
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:13,591
- How many dead?
- 15. They're still finding bodies.

188
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:16,219
- Any survivors?
- Yeah, there's two.

189
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:18,805
One's in hospital in a coma.

190
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:22,225
The D.A. Has the second,
a cripple from New York.

191
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:27,105
The chief wants this place
sealed off. Call him.

192
00:18:01,723 --> 00:18:05,018
<i>This is David Kujan. I'll be
in Los Angeles until Tuesday.</i>

193
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,147
<i>If you need to reach me, contact
Jeff Rabin, San Pedro P.D.,</i>

194
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,024
<i>on extension 112.</i>

195
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,109
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

196
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:18,615
- Why can't I see him?
- Dave, I told you.

197
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:23,620
The D.A. Was ready to arraign
before they moved him to county.

198
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:28,958
Kint's lawyers comes and the D.A.
Comes out looking smacked around.

199
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:32,754
They take his statement
and cut him a deal.

200
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:37,008
- Did they charge him?
- Yeah, weapons. Misdemeanor 2.

201
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:39,010
What is that?

202
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:44,140
- I give the D.A. Credit for that.
- Excuse me, sir.

203
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:50,480
It's turned political. The Mayor
and Chief were here last night.

204
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:53,149
This morning, the Governor called.

205
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:58,446
This guy is protected from on high
by the Prince of Darkness.

206
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,449
- When does he post bail?
- Two hours, tops.

207
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:04,327
- I want to see him.
- No.

208
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:08,581
- I cannot do this for you.
- I came a long way for this.

209
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,668
Dave, please.

210
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:18,007
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

211
00:19:19,217 --> 00:19:23,346
He's paranoid. He knows the
interrogation rooms are wired.

212
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:26,975
I quit. It won't be an interrogation,
just a friendly chat.

213
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:29,227
He won't go in there.

214
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:31,104
- Then someplace else.
- Where?

215
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:38,486
Where is the dope?
If it was a hit, who called it in?

216
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,449
I'm sure you have wild theories
to answer all these questions.

217
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,577
- You know what I think.
- It doesn't even matter.

218
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:48,621
The guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

219
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,207
He doesn't know
what you want to know.

220
00:19:51,374 --> 00:19:53,168
I don't think he does, exactly.

221
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:55,545
There's more to his story.

222
00:19:55,879 --> 00:20:00,008
I want to know why 27 men
died on that pier...

223
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:04,262
for 91 million dollars of dope
that wasn't there.

224
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:08,224
Above all, I want to be sure
Dean Keaton's dead.

225
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:09,934
He's dead.

226
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:12,937
Come on, two hours.
Just till he makes bail.

227
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:15,148
They're all dead.

228
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,527
I don't care how tough Keaton was.
Nobody could've survived that boat.

229
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:24,908
Is he talking?

230
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,120
He regained consciousness,
he spoke, not English, and lapsed.

231
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:31,539
- Hungarian.
- I don't know, maybe.

232
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:33,291
Most of them were Hungarians.

233
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:37,045
- You've got to put this on.
- Burns victims catch infections.

234
00:20:37,796 --> 00:20:40,298
And of course there's no smoking.

235
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:52,602
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

236
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:53,520
Is he going to die?

237
00:20:53,937 --> 00:20:56,731
He's got burns on 60% of
his body and broken ribs.

238
00:20:56,898 --> 00:21:00,693
- Get a man put on the door.
- Is he dangerous?

239
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,694
Yes.

240
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:03,113
Do it.

241
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:04,989
Do it now.

242
00:21:08,076 --> 00:21:10,328
Yeah, Baer. Down at L.A. County.

243
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:14,707
The guy they pulled out of
the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.

244
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:19,254
Nah, he's all fucked up.

245
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,549
I can't hear you.

246
00:21:22,924 --> 00:21:25,218
Shut up. I'm on the phone.

247
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:29,556
Send me

248
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,349
someone who can
speak Hungarian.

249
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,018
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

250
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:37,939
What?

251
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:39,482
Keyser Soze!

252
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:45,822
No shit.

253
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:53,079
Call Dan Metzheiser at Justice
and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

254
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,033
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan
from Customs.

255
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:34,746
- Nice to meet you.
- He want to ask some questions.

256
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:38,458
- What about?
- About Dean Keaton mostly.

257
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:41,836
I'd like to start with
the lineup back in New York.

258
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:45,673
- Can I get some coffee?
- In a while. What about the lineup?

259
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:49,260
I'm really thirsty. I used to
dehydrate as a kid.

260
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:52,639
Once my piss came out
like snot. I was all thick and...

261
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:56,351
- I'll get your fucking coffee.
- Get me one too.

262
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:05,151
That guy is tense.
Tension is a killer.

263
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:08,071
I used to be in a barbershop
quartet in Skokie, Illinois.

264
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:12,408
The baritone was this fat guy
named Kip Diskin.

265
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:16,079
- He got so stressed in the morning.
- We're trying to help you.

266
00:23:16,412 --> 00:23:20,083
I appreciate that and I want to
help you, Agent Kujan.

267
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:24,129
I like cops.
I would've been a fed...

268
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:28,299
You're not telling everything.
I know you know something.

269
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:31,052
<i>I told the D.A. Everything.</i>

270
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,016
<i>I know you like Keaton
and you think he's a good man.</i>

271
00:23:37,392 --> 00:23:40,186
<i>- I know he was good.
- He was a corrupt cop.</i>

272
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,356
<i>Sure, fifteen years ago.
But he was a good thief.</i>

273
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:45,942
Cops wouldn't let him go legit.

274
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:47,735
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

275
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:54,200
Are you trying to get a rise
out of me, Agent Kujan?

276
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:57,620
- I just want to hear your story.
- It's all there.

277
00:23:58,663 --> 00:23:59,706
May I have a cigarette?

278
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:05,462
- According to your statement...
- I need a light.

279
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:12,719
According to your statement
you're a short con operator.

280
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:21,728
According to your statement
you're a short con operator.

281
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,647
Run of the mill scams.

282
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:28,234
- That's suppressed, inadmissible.
- I know.

283
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,112
Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

284
00:24:32,113 --> 00:24:35,366
I do have the weapons charge.

285
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:37,702
I'm looking at 6 months hard time.

286
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:39,913
You know a dealer
named Ruby Deemer?

287
00:24:41,164 --> 00:24:43,416
You know a religious guy
named John Paul?

288
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,419
- You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

289
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:50,465
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.
He's a friend, he likes me.

290
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,134
I know your testimony's sealed,

291
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:56,346
but Ruby's got lots of
friends inside.

292
00:24:56,846 --> 00:25:00,975
What would he say if he found out
you dropped his name to the D. A?

293
00:25:01,142 --> 00:25:04,187
- There's nothing there about Ruby.
- I'll mention that to him.

294
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:07,440
First thing I learned on the job
was how to spot a murderer.

295
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:11,569
You arrest three guys for a killing
and put them in jail overnight.

296
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:13,988
Next morning, whoever is
sleeping is your man.

297
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:17,492
If you're guilty, you know you're
caught and let your guard down.

298
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:19,911
- You follow me?
- No.

299
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:21,830
Let me get right to the point.

300
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,166
I'm smarter than you.

301
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:30,380
And I'll find out what I want
whether you like it or not.

302
00:25:31,381 --> 00:25:33,383
I'm not a rat.

303
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:40,598
Thank you.

304
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:48,398
When I picked beans in Guatemala,
we used to make fresh coffee.

305
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:52,485
Right off the trees.
That was good. This is shit,

306
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:55,155
- but I'm in a police station.
- Can we get started again?

307
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:58,450
What happened after the lineup?

308
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,791
The desk sergeant said
he couldn't release you.

309
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,461
You weren't even charged.

310
00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:18,636
I want pictures of your face.
I'll take them to the D.A.

311
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:19,971
Forget about it.

312
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:22,474
I'll have this thing in front of
a Grand Jury by Monday.

313
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,767
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

314
00:26:27,729 --> 00:26:29,689
What did Fortier and Renault say?

315
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,400
They asked for more time
to think about investing.

316
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:35,862
- They just want more time.
- More time for what, Edie?

317
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,616
No matter how you cover my tracks,
they'll still find out about me.

318
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:41,659
Give me some credit.

319
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,914
Let's go to the Grand Jury.
This isn't going to stop.

320
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:48,750
It's never going to stop, period.

321
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:52,545
By next week, every investor
will walk away from us.

322
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:57,842
It's finished. I'm finished.

323
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:05,934
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

324
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,979
It's never going to stop.

325
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:18,530
I love you.

326
00:27:19,489 --> 00:27:22,158
They ruined me in there tonight.

327
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:25,120
I love you.

328
00:27:26,788 --> 00:27:27,914
Do you hear me?

329
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,089
What?

330
00:27:41,136 --> 00:27:43,096
Let's just go to my place.

331
00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:00,738
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

332
00:28:04,868 --> 00:28:06,369
- All right.
- Let's go.

333
00:28:08,746 --> 00:28:11,291
<i>Fenster and McManus
had a cagey proposition,</i>

334
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:14,544
<i>a fast jump, high risk,
long money.</i>

335
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:19,048
<i>We knew it could be done,
but doing it wrong meant killing.</i>

336
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,595
<i>To do it right took five men.
Five men meant Keaton.</i>

337
00:28:24,888 --> 00:28:27,348
<i>Keaton took convincing.</i>

338
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:31,144
New York's Finest Taxi Service.

339
00:28:32,437 --> 00:28:34,022
Bullshit.

340
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:35,899
Bullshit.

341
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:39,068
They don't operate anymore.

342
00:28:39,444 --> 00:28:43,156
McManus' friend in the 14th says
they're doing one job on Thursday.

343
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:48,369
Some emerald smuggler.
McManus has a fence.

344
00:28:48,703 --> 00:28:51,247
- A fence? Who?
- A guy in California. Redfoot.

345
00:28:51,581 --> 00:28:54,501
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

346
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:56,503
What's it to you if I do or not?

347
00:28:57,253 --> 00:29:01,090
They don't know me, you do.
They won't take me unless you go.

348
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:03,885
I need this.

349
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:08,097
You don't?
Is this your place?

350
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:11,684
Looks like you got a good
scam going with this lawyer.

351
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:17,649
I'm sorry.

352
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:20,443
It's okay.

353
00:29:21,736 --> 00:29:24,239
You say it's the real thing,
that's cool.

354
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:30,161
- You okay?
- I was out of line.

355
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:33,706
But they'll never stop with us.

356
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,751
They'll never let you go now.

357
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:40,922
We hit the cops where it hurts
and we get well in the meantime.

358
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:46,636
You sure you're okay?

359
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:48,513
I'll be all right.

360
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:04,279
Look...

361
00:30:05,488 --> 00:30:07,282
- Sometimes I get...
- Forget it.

362
00:30:10,994 --> 00:30:13,413
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

363
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:25,550
So...

364
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,221
How do they want to do it?

365
00:30:31,556 --> 00:30:34,642
McManus wants to
go in shooting. I say no.

366
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:38,146
Fenster? Hockney?

367
00:30:38,396 --> 00:30:41,024
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

368
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:44,068
I got a way to do it without
killing anyone, but like I say,

369
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:46,696
they won't let me in without you.

370
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:06,508
Three million?

371
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:09,928
Maybe more.

372
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:15,975
No killing.

373
00:31:17,477 --> 00:31:20,230
Not if we do it my way.

374
00:31:53,263 --> 00:31:56,433
<i>New York's Finest Taxi Service
was not your normal taxi service.</i>

375
00:31:56,808 --> 00:32:00,812
<i>It was a ring of corrupt NYPD cops
that ran a high profit racket,</i>

376
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:03,064
<i>driving smugglers and
drug dealers all over the city.</i>

377
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:06,776
<i>For a few hundred dollars a mile,
you got your own police escort.</i>

378
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:08,736
<i>They even had business cards.</i>

379
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:13,158
<i>Someone started asking questions
and the taxi service shut down.</i>

380
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,703
<i>Ever since, Internal Affairs
has been waiting to catch them.</i>

381
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,538
<i>And that's where we came in.</i>

382
00:32:18,872 --> 00:32:22,292
- So how was the flight?
- Fuckin' great.

383
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:26,629
Will this get me to Staten Island?

384
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:29,716
This'll get you to Cape Cod.

385
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,969
<i>McManus came to us with the job.
Fenster got the vans,</i>

386
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:37,140
<i>Hockney the hardware and I
figured how to get no one killed.</i>

387
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:40,643
<i>Keaton put on the finishing touch.</i>

388
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,981
<i>A little "fuck you"from
the five of us to the NYPD.</i>

389
00:32:48,318 --> 00:32:50,278
Careful! Careful!

390
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,697
Come on, asshole.

391
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,205
- Don't move, you fucker!
- Drop it!

392
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:04,584
- Don't point that at me!
- What do you guys want?

393
00:33:07,045 --> 00:33:09,130
Asshole!

394
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:14,886
Want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?

395
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:18,723
Fuck!

396
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,938
Good afternoon, porkchops.
Now give me the shit.

397
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:27,732
- Give him the shit!
- Give it to him, man!

398
00:33:30,235 --> 00:33:31,486
Hurry up!

399
00:33:32,946 --> 00:33:36,741
- Now the money.
- There's no money.

400
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:39,702
Give me the fucking money.

401
00:33:39,911 --> 00:33:41,162
There's no money.

402
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:43,164
- Give him the fucking money!
- There's no money.

403
00:33:43,414 --> 00:33:44,833
Hurry up!

404
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,128
Do you know who I am?

405
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:50,338
You know who the fuck I am?

406
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:53,174
We do now, jerkoff.

407
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,975
What's that?

408
00:34:05,854 --> 00:34:07,397
Shit!

409
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:25,957
<i>Keaton made an anonymous
phone call.</i>

410
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,710
<i>The press was on the scene
before the police.</i>

411
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:34,048
<i>Strausz and Rizzi were indicted
and weeks later, 50 more cops.</i>

412
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:37,469
<i>Everybody got it in the ass
from the Chief on down.</i>

413
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:39,679
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

414
00:34:47,854 --> 00:34:49,773
I owe you two-fifty.

415
00:34:51,316 --> 00:34:52,650
Doctor Keaton.

416
00:34:55,153 --> 00:34:58,323
- There's more than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

417
00:34:59,073 --> 00:35:01,951
Redfoot doesn't come to me,
I always go to him.

418
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:04,829
In California?

419
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:08,249
Yes. Fenster and I...

420
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:11,753
Hold the fucking phone!
You and Fenster?

421
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:17,383
- You fucking kidding me?
- Okay, everyone's going.

422
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:19,344
We all go.

423
00:35:20,762 --> 00:35:22,972
What's your fucking problem?

424
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:25,975
You and Fenster are off
honeymooning in California

425
00:35:26,142 --> 00:35:28,561
and the rest of us
are holding our dicks.

426
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:33,399
The job is over.
Cool it.

427
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:36,861
L.A.'s a good place to lie low
for a while.

428
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:41,032
You want to dance?

429
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:49,916
Ladies.

430
00:35:57,674 --> 00:35:59,634
I would like to propose a toast.

431
00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:02,762
There you go.

432
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:06,599
To Mr. Verbal.

433
00:36:08,226 --> 00:36:10,353
The man with the plan.

434
00:36:23,408 --> 00:36:25,201
We're going to miss the flight.

435
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:28,997
Don't do this. Send her a note.

436
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:32,000
I said we'll make it.

437
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:07,827
We're going to miss the plane.

438
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:11,164
She'll understand.

439
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:32,602
That's heartwarming. Really.

440
00:37:34,729 --> 00:37:36,439
I'm weepy.

441
00:37:37,273 --> 00:37:39,192
Want to wait outside?

442
00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:45,782
I'm telling you what happened
after the lineup.

443
00:37:46,074 --> 00:37:49,244
Come on, Verbal, who do you
think you're talking to?

444
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:54,541
You expect me to believe
he retired? For a woman?

445
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:59,504
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

446
00:37:59,796 --> 00:38:02,006
- He loved her.
- Sure.

447
00:38:02,257 --> 00:38:05,510
<i>And hitting the Taxi Service
wasn't his idea either?</i>

448
00:38:05,802 --> 00:38:09,305
<i>- It was all Fenster and McManus.
- Keaton was a cop for 4 years.</i>

449
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:12,767
<i>Who knew the Service better?
That job had his name on it.</i>

450
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,310
<i>Edie had him all turned round.</i>

451
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:16,062
Let me tell you something.

452
00:38:16,604 --> 00:38:20,733
I know Keaton. I've been
investigating him for 3 years.

453
00:38:21,025 --> 00:38:23,570
He's a cold-blooded bastard.

454
00:38:24,112 --> 00:38:28,199
I.A.D. Indicted him on 3 counts
of murder before he was kicked off.

455
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:30,410
Don't sell me the hooker
with the heart of gold.

456
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,203
You've got him all wrong.

457
00:38:33,163 --> 00:38:34,581
Do I?

458
00:38:34,914 --> 00:38:39,335
He was under indictment 7 times
while he was on the force.

459
00:38:39,669 --> 00:38:43,047
In every case, the witnesses
either reversed their testimony...

460
00:38:43,465 --> 00:38:46,217
or died before they could testify.

461
00:38:46,634 --> 00:38:50,972
They finally nailed him for fraud
and he spent 5 years in Sing Sing.

462
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:53,308
He killed 3 prisoners inside.

463
00:38:53,975 --> 00:38:55,894
Of course,
I can't prove this.

464
00:38:57,145 --> 00:38:59,647
But I can't prove
the best part either.

465
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:05,153
Dean Keaton was dead.
Did you know that?

466
00:39:05,528 --> 00:39:08,656
He died in a fire two years ago
during an investigation into

467
00:39:08,948 --> 00:39:12,494
the murder of a witness who was
going to testify against him.

468
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:17,332
Two people saw him walk into
his warehouse before it blew up.

469
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:21,002
They said he went in to check
a leaking gas main.

470
00:39:21,544 --> 00:39:25,131
It blew up and took all of
Dean Keaton with it.

471
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:30,637
Within three months
the two witnesses were dead.

472
00:39:31,387 --> 00:39:33,389
One killed himself in his car,

473
00:39:33,681 --> 00:39:36,726
the other fell down
an open elevator shaft.

474
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:41,648
<i>Let's get this show on the road.</i>

475
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,234
This is not what we discussed.
There are too many people.

476
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,070
We'll be out of here before
he blows his porch light.

477
00:39:47,403 --> 00:39:51,366
- I have a noon meeting.
- Everyone calm down, all right?

478
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:55,245
I want you to ask this man about
the shoot-out in the harbor.

479
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,299
He says they were buying...

480
00:40:08,466 --> 00:40:10,093
Dope. We know.

481
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:19,894
He doesn't know what they
were buying, but not dope. People.

482
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:21,229
What?

483
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:32,073
- He needs guarantees...
- What's he talking about?

484
00:40:32,365 --> 00:40:33,950
He says his life's in danger.

485
00:40:35,577 --> 00:40:38,997
He saw the devil,
looked him in the eye.

486
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,499
- I'm on my way.
- No, wait a minute.

487
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:44,627
Ask him to tell you
what he told me.

488
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:48,506
The devil. Who's the devil?

489
00:40:54,137 --> 00:40:56,181
Keyser Soze.

490
00:41:01,895 --> 00:41:04,981
He was in the harbor
killing many men.

491
00:41:05,356 --> 00:41:07,358
He saw Keyser Soze?

492
00:41:13,948 --> 00:41:16,242
He saw his face.

493
00:41:16,534 --> 00:41:19,078
Tell him to tell her
what he looks like.

494
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:20,789
Describe him.

495
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:30,215
<i>I get an anonymous phone call</i>

496
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:33,468
<i>telling me I can find Keaton
at Mondino's with his attorney,</i>

497
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:34,511
<i>and there he is.</i>

498
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:38,181
Because he never profited
from his alleged death,

499
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:42,977
and we pinned the murder
on another, we had to let him go.

500
00:41:44,562 --> 00:41:47,232
He was dead long enough
for the murder rap to blow over,

501
00:41:47,398 --> 00:41:49,067
and then he had lunch.

502
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:53,071
- I don't know about that.
- I don't think you do.

503
00:41:53,905 --> 00:41:56,241
But you say you saw Keaton die.

504
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:59,119
I think you're covering his ass
and he's still out there.

505
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:01,871
He's behind the whole circus
at the harbor.

506
00:42:02,163 --> 00:42:05,375
He's using you because you're stupid
and you think he's your friend.

507
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,836
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

508
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:11,131
I want to be sure he's dead
before I go back to New York.

509
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:13,842
It was the lawyer behind it.

510
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:16,094
What lawyer?

511
00:42:16,845 --> 00:42:17,887
What lawyer, Verbal?

512
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:20,974
When I was in that barbershop
quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

513
00:42:21,266 --> 00:42:25,186
You held out on the D. A!
What did you leave out?

514
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:28,356
- I can phone Deemer in ten minutes.
- The D.A. Gave me immunity.

515
00:42:29,065 --> 00:42:32,610
You get no immunity from me,
you piece of shit.

516
00:42:32,861 --> 00:42:35,905
Every criminal I put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor,

517
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:40,076
every creep and scumbag
will know the name Verbal Kint.

518
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,996
Talk, or that precious immunity
they see fit to grant you

519
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:47,417
won't be worth the paper of
the contract put out on you.

520
00:42:50,462 --> 00:42:52,380
There was a lawyer.

521
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,341
Kobayashi.

522
00:42:56,009 --> 00:43:00,930
- Did he kill Keaton?
- No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.

523
00:43:01,347 --> 00:43:02,807
Convince me.

524
00:43:03,516 --> 00:43:06,186
And tell me every last detail.

525
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:28,583
<i>In Los Angeles we met
McManus'fence, Redfoot.</i>

526
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:32,796
<i>He had a good reputation,
he seemed like a good guy.</i>

527
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:35,381
We should have known better.

528
00:43:35,548 --> 00:43:36,341
How you doing?

529
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,427
- Good. You?
- Not bad, can't complain.

530
00:43:40,303 --> 00:43:42,388
How you doing, Fenster?

531
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:45,308
Want me to open it, Ray?

532
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:53,149
You must be Keaton.

533
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,527
Redfoot, Dean Keaton,

534
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:57,529
Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.

535
00:43:57,695 --> 00:44:00,281
Verbal, the man with the plan.

536
00:44:00,907 --> 00:44:02,492
You guys interested in more work?

537
00:44:03,368 --> 00:44:04,994
We're always looking for work.

538
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:06,454
We're on vacation.

539
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:08,748
Well, that's too bad.

540
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:13,044
I got a ton of work and no
good people. Not like you guys.

541
00:44:13,378 --> 00:44:17,006
- What's the job?
- A Texas jeweler named Saul.

542
00:44:17,382 --> 00:44:19,509
He rents a hotel suite downtown.

543
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:23,304
He does free appraisals.
Sometimes buys, sometimes doesn't.

544
00:44:23,596 --> 00:44:26,182
He carries around a lot of cash.

545
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:31,020
I figure I get the merchandise,
you keep the green.

546
00:44:32,313 --> 00:44:34,899
- What about security?
- Couple of bodyguards.

547
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:36,317
Nothing you couldn't handle.

548
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:38,820
Give me time to check it out?

549
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:41,531
I'd expect nothing less from you.

550
00:44:42,824 --> 00:44:45,076
We'll call you.

551
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:48,079
Enjoy L. A... Get yourself laid.

552
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:57,005
Friend of mine in New York
says you knew Spook Hollis.

553
00:44:57,964 --> 00:45:00,175
The way I hear it, you did time
with old Spook.

554
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:04,763
Good man. I used to
run dope for him.

555
00:45:05,889 --> 00:45:08,475
- Too bad he got shivved.
- Yeah.

556
00:45:10,226 --> 00:45:11,478
I shivved him.

557
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,608
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else.

558
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,779
I appreciate that.

559
00:45:22,113 --> 00:45:23,573
Just out of curiosity,

560
00:45:24,115 --> 00:45:25,241
was it business,

561
00:45:26,117 --> 00:45:27,660
or personal?

562
00:45:29,078 --> 00:45:30,121
A bit of both.

563
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,708
Like I said,

564
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:36,711
give me a call if you're interested.

565
00:45:41,174 --> 00:45:42,759
Is there a problem?

566
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:47,514
One job. That was the deal.

567
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:54,687
One job?

568
00:45:57,357 --> 00:45:59,317
One job?

569
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:02,195
That's a good one, Keaton.

570
00:46:04,405 --> 00:46:08,159
<i>Keaton fought as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.</i>

571
00:46:08,451 --> 00:46:11,329
<i>He can convince anyone he's
someone else, but never himself.</i>

572
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:14,874
<i>One day of McManus nagging
and we went back to work.</i>

573
00:46:29,681 --> 00:46:32,016
So my car is wrecked.

574
00:46:32,308 --> 00:46:35,770
I look in the other car
and this woman is naked.

575
00:46:36,062 --> 00:46:39,149
- I laugh so hard I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

576
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:40,859
Freeze!

577
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:41,901
Here we go!

578
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:43,236
Right there.

579
00:46:44,112 --> 00:46:46,156
The second one.

580
00:46:49,576 --> 00:46:52,495
Give me the case.
Give me the fucking case!

581
00:46:59,002 --> 00:47:02,297
Give me the fucking case!
For the last time,

582
00:47:02,714 --> 00:47:04,507
give me the fucking case!

583
00:47:09,137 --> 00:47:10,388
Come on!

584
00:47:10,638 --> 00:47:11,681
Don't move.

585
00:47:46,883 --> 00:47:48,718
Just hand over the case.

586
00:47:49,594 --> 00:47:51,596
Hand over the fucking case.

587
00:48:15,578 --> 00:48:17,288
Come on, let's go.

588
00:48:18,957 --> 00:48:21,334
Bad day. Fuck it.

589
00:48:21,543 --> 00:48:22,961
Go! Go!

590
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:48,987
Fuck.

591
00:48:51,072 --> 00:48:54,742
Looks like a lot of
China to me. Shit!

592
00:49:00,248 --> 00:49:01,749
Guys, come on!

593
00:49:03,168 --> 00:49:05,503
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna kill him.

594
00:49:05,753 --> 00:49:08,715
- Now we'll do it my way.
- Are you gonna kill him?

595
00:49:08,882 --> 00:49:10,008
I'm gonna deal with him.

596
00:49:10,175 --> 00:49:13,261
- You better, or I'm going to.
- Shut up.

597
00:49:20,477 --> 00:49:21,644
What do I do with that?

598
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:24,731
Feed it to the gimp.

599
00:49:25,023 --> 00:49:27,942
- Ease his pain.
- You don't know what that is?

600
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:30,612
Some lawyer threw me this job.

601
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:31,738
Yeah, who?

602
00:49:32,155 --> 00:49:33,573
I don't know. Some Limey.

603
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,117
He's a middle man for someone.

604
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:39,245
- He doesn't say. I don't ask.
- You're fucking full of shit!

605
00:49:39,454 --> 00:49:40,163
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

606
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:43,917
Listen. We want to meet him.

607
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:46,044
That's funny.

608
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,422
He called me last night.
Says he wants to meet you guys.

609
00:49:50,965 --> 00:49:52,217
Okay.

610
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,052
- We'll meet him.
- I'll call you.

611
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:57,305
- Good. Do that. No problem.
- I don't like it. Wait a minute.

612
00:49:57,472 --> 00:49:58,890
One more thing, tough guy.

613
00:49:59,224 --> 00:50:01,893
Any more surprises
and I'll kill you.

614
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:06,231
Such a tough guy, McManus.
Do me a favor, all right?

615
00:50:06,523 --> 00:50:08,233
Get the fuck off my dick.

616
00:50:11,444 --> 00:50:13,613
Put a leash on that puppy.

617
00:50:15,406 --> 00:50:18,535
Shame about Saul getting whacked.

618
00:50:19,452 --> 00:50:21,788
Cops are going to be looking for
the guys who did it.

619
00:50:22,872 --> 00:50:25,458
Sooner or later they'll
come around asking me.

620
00:50:27,794 --> 00:50:30,255
You have a sweet night, ladies.

621
00:50:33,758 --> 00:50:35,552
Fuck you.

622
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:44,185
- So, this lawyer...
- Kobayashi.

623
00:50:45,019 --> 00:50:47,313
- Came from Redfoot.
- Right.

624
00:50:47,939 --> 00:50:50,358
Why leave this out when you
talked to the D. A?

625
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,777
Dave, someone to see you.

626
00:50:58,283 --> 00:51:00,118
I've been looking all over for you.

627
00:51:00,452 --> 00:51:03,872
Still after that coke that left that
bloodbath in the harbor yesterday?

628
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:06,583
You can stop looking.
There was no coke.

629
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:11,963
I talked to the guy they pulled out
of a drain pipe after the shootout.

630
00:51:12,547 --> 00:51:14,591
He came to this morning.

631
00:51:14,883 --> 00:51:17,594
He's part of a Hungarian mob
doing a deal with Argentineans.

632
00:51:17,886 --> 00:51:20,638
He says it was definitely not
a dope deal.

633
00:51:20,805 --> 00:51:21,806
But...

634
00:51:21,973 --> 00:51:23,892
Our man says no way on the dope.

635
00:51:24,058 --> 00:51:27,687
The whole bunch was pulling stumps
for Turkey the next day.

636
00:51:27,979 --> 00:51:31,357
They had no time to negotiate
or move that kind of product.

637
00:51:31,608 --> 00:51:33,526
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

638
00:51:33,818 --> 00:51:38,615
No one knew except for key people.
They were very hush about it.

639
00:51:39,282 --> 00:51:41,951
It was very sensitive.

640
00:51:42,118 --> 00:51:43,161
I don't get it.

641
00:51:43,453 --> 00:51:47,582
They tell me you got the cripple.
Did he mention Keyser Soze?

642
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:48,374
Who?

643
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:50,835
Just bear with me here.

644
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:56,174
- Who is Keyser Soze?
- Fuck!

645
00:51:56,716 --> 00:51:59,636
We've been going over this
for an hour and a half.

646
00:52:00,345 --> 00:52:04,265
We need to find Redfoot,
and get the hell out of here.

647
00:52:04,557 --> 00:52:07,852
What we need to do
is think back.

648
00:52:09,145 --> 00:52:11,731
Somebody with power,

649
00:52:12,398 --> 00:52:15,610
capable of tracking us
from New York to Los Angeles.

650
00:52:15,902 --> 00:52:18,530
- What the hell are we doing here?
- We're waiting.

651
00:52:19,322 --> 00:52:23,034
- Sit down.
- No. It's hot and I'm bored.

652
00:52:23,326 --> 00:52:25,495
Mr. Hockney, do stay.
Mr. Keaton.

653
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,626
Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus
I recognize from mugshots.

654
00:52:31,876 --> 00:52:36,589
I assume you are Mr. Kint,
the man who disposed of Saul Berg.

655
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,094
My employer sends his gratitude.
An unexpected benefit.

656
00:52:41,761 --> 00:52:43,513
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

657
00:52:43,805 --> 00:52:48,351
I've been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal.

658
00:52:48,643 --> 00:52:51,729
- What do you want?
- Your services, gentlemen.

659
00:52:53,606 --> 00:52:57,318
One job, one day's work.
Very dangerous.

660
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:00,905
He doesn't expect you all to live,
but those of you who do

661
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:04,200
will have 91 million dollars
to divide between you

662
00:53:04,367 --> 00:53:06,327
- in any way you see fit.
- Who's your boss?

663
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,957
I work for Keyser Soze.

664
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,764
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Judging by the change in mood,

665
00:53:25,972 --> 00:53:28,391
I feel your associates can tell you.

666
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,061
I come with an offer from Mr. Soze.

667
00:53:32,353 --> 00:53:35,899
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean "an order"?

668
00:53:36,357 --> 00:53:38,693
In 1981, Mr. Keaton, you hijacked

669
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,571
a truck in Buffalo, New York.

670
00:53:41,905 --> 00:53:45,283
The cargo was raw steel
which belonged to Mr. Soze

671
00:53:45,617 --> 00:53:49,579
and was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

672
00:53:49,996 --> 00:53:52,957
A most profitable violation
of UN regulations.

673
00:53:53,124 --> 00:53:55,043
You had no way of knowing this

674
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,296
because the man shipping the steel
was working for Mr. Soze

675
00:53:58,463 --> 00:53:59,798
without his knowledge.

676
00:54:00,381 --> 00:54:01,883
Earlier this year, Mr. Fenster

677
00:54:02,092 --> 00:54:06,721
and Mr. McManus hijacked
a cargo flight out of Newark.

678
00:54:06,971 --> 00:54:11,267
The plane carried gold and
platinum wiring, also for Pakistan.

679
00:54:11,893 --> 00:54:14,270
Two months ago, Mr. Hockney

680
00:54:14,437 --> 00:54:17,190
stole a truck carrying gun parts
through Queens.

681
00:54:18,066 --> 00:54:21,444
They were set to be destroyed
by the State of New York.

682
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:25,198
They were to be lost
and re-routed to New York.

683
00:54:25,532 --> 00:54:28,576
Again Mr. Soze using pawns
who had no knowledge.

684
00:54:28,952 --> 00:54:31,579
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

685
00:54:32,455 --> 00:54:33,540
Nine months ago,

686
00:54:33,706 --> 00:54:36,417
an unintelligent courier for Mr. Soze

687
00:54:36,584 --> 00:54:41,131
was taken in a confidence scam
by a cripple.

688
00:54:42,006 --> 00:54:44,801
He was relieved of $62,000.

689
00:54:45,135 --> 00:54:48,096
It's taken us some time to find you.

690
00:54:48,471 --> 00:54:52,267
We were to approach you after
your apprehension in New York.

691
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,686
- You set up the lineup.
- Yes,

692
00:54:54,853 --> 00:54:57,188
I was to come and see you.

693
00:54:57,355 --> 00:55:00,275
It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney,
Miss Finnerman,

694
00:55:00,608 --> 00:55:04,070
was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

695
00:55:04,362 --> 00:55:06,448
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

696
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:09,409
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

697
00:55:09,742 --> 00:55:12,162
Mr. Soze rarely works with
the same people for very long,

698
00:55:12,328 --> 00:55:14,080
and they never know
who they're working for.

699
00:55:15,248 --> 00:55:18,585
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

700
00:55:19,002 --> 00:55:21,087
So why are you telling us?

701
00:55:21,588 --> 00:55:26,384
Because you've stolen from
Mr. Soze, all of you.

702
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,805
That you did not know it
is the reason you're still alive.

703
00:55:31,097 --> 00:55:35,018
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

704
00:55:35,351 --> 00:55:39,147
Fuck the debt and you. How do
we know you work for Soze?

705
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:42,233
I don't think that's relevant.

706
00:55:42,525 --> 00:55:47,071
You're responsible for the murder
of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.

707
00:55:47,405 --> 00:55:51,451
Redfoot can testify and we can
see to it that he will.

708
00:55:51,785 --> 00:55:54,954
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen.

709
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:58,833
Mr. Soze's primary interest
is narcotics.

710
00:55:59,334 --> 00:56:04,464
He has been competing for years
with some Argentineans.

711
00:56:04,756 --> 00:56:07,884
Competing with Mr. Soze
has taken its toll.

712
00:56:08,635 --> 00:56:11,930
These Argentineans are
negotiating the sale of 91...

713
00:56:12,097 --> 00:56:14,974
million dollars in cocaine in 3 days.

714
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:19,521
This purchase will revitalize
the diminishing strength

715
00:56:19,687 --> 00:56:21,147
of their organization.

716
00:56:21,689 --> 00:56:25,443
Mr. Soze would like you
to stop the deal.

717
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:31,199
You may wait until after the buy.
Any money is yours.

718
00:56:32,492 --> 00:56:37,413
He would like you to get to
the boat and destroy the cocaine.

719
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:42,544
Then you will be free of your
obligations to Mr. Soze.

720
00:56:44,504 --> 00:56:47,799
Give me one reason why
I shouldn't kill you right now.

721
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:50,885
A gift

722
00:56:51,052 --> 00:56:52,345
from Mr. Soze.

723
00:56:55,723 --> 00:56:57,142
Good day, gentlemen.

724
00:58:06,628 --> 00:58:09,964
They've got my whole life,
everything I've done since I was 18.

725
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,925
They fuckin' know everything.

726
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,345
Everybody I've worked with
or did time with.

727
00:58:33,238 --> 00:58:35,115
- No. This isn't right.
- I don't know.

728
00:58:35,281 --> 00:58:37,700
Who was that guy who talked
about Soze in New York?

729
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,246
Bricks Marlin.

730
00:58:41,412 --> 00:58:44,374
Yeah, he did jobs for him.
Indirect stuff.

731
00:58:44,707 --> 00:58:47,794
Said he always made five times
more than the job was worth.

732
00:58:49,087 --> 00:58:53,341
A pipe dream. Kobayashi's
using him as window dressing.

733
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:55,552
I don't know. This is bad.

734
00:58:55,844 --> 00:58:59,681
It's bullshit. Guy could be LAPD.
It's a fucking setup.

735
00:59:00,723 --> 00:59:03,601
The way I hear it,
Soze's some kind of butcher.

736
00:59:04,018 --> 00:59:08,231
- A peerless psycho butcher.
- There is no Keyser Soze!

737
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:12,694
Who is Keyser Soze?

738
00:59:13,528 --> 00:59:17,157
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

739
00:59:17,449 --> 00:59:19,451
Nobody believed he was real

740
00:59:19,784 --> 00:59:22,871
or saw anybody that
worked directly for him.

741
00:59:23,204 --> 00:59:25,957
To hear Kobayashi, anyone
could have worked for Soze.

742
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:29,210
You never knew.
That was his power.

743
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:33,131
The greatest trick
the Devil ever pulled...

744
00:59:33,506 --> 00:59:36,676
was convincing the world
he didn't exist.

745
00:59:38,052 --> 00:59:42,098
A story they told me that I believe
is from his days in Turkey.

746
00:59:42,432 --> 00:59:44,768
Some Hungarians
wanted their own mob.

747
00:59:44,934 --> 00:59:47,103
They realized
that to be in power,

748
00:59:47,437 --> 00:59:50,231
you didn't need guns or money
or even numbers.

749
00:59:50,523 --> 00:59:53,777
You just needed the will to do
what the other guy wouldn't.

750
00:59:54,444 --> 00:59:57,614
They come into power
and then they come after Soze.

751
00:59:57,947 --> 01:00:00,492
He was just running dope then.

752
01:00:03,578 --> 01:00:04,913
They come to his home
in the afternoon

753
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:07,707
<i>looking for his business.</i>

754
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:11,586
<i>They find his wife and kids
and decide to wait for Soze.</i>

755
01:00:27,936 --> 01:00:32,148
<i>He comes home to find his wife
raped and children screaming.</i>

756
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,693
<i>The Hungarians knew Soze was
tough, not to be trifled with.</i>

757
01:00:35,985 --> 01:00:37,570
So they let him know
they meant business.

758
01:00:42,992 --> 01:00:46,412
<i>They tell him they want
his territory, all his business.</i>

759
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:50,708
Soze looks over the faces
of his family.

760
01:00:52,127 --> 01:00:55,922
Then he showed these men of will
what will really was.

761
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,069
<i>He tells them he would rather
see his family dead</i>

762
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,655
<i>than live another day after this.</i>

763
01:01:22,365 --> 01:01:24,325
<i>He lets the last Hungarian go.</i>

764
01:01:24,659 --> 01:01:28,830
After his wife and kids are buried,
he goes after the rest of the mob.

765
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:32,459
He kills their kids,
he kills their wives,

766
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:34,210
parents and their parents' friends.

767
01:01:34,919 --> 01:01:37,005
<i>He burns down their houses</i>

768
01:01:37,881 --> 01:01:39,632
<i>and the stores they work in.</i>

769
01:01:39,966 --> 01:01:43,470
<i>He kills people that owe them money.
And like that...</i>

770
01:01:45,013 --> 01:01:48,266
he's gone.
Nobody's seen him since.

771
01:01:48,558 --> 01:01:52,687
He becomes a myth, a spook story
criminals tell their kids at night.

772
01:01:52,979 --> 01:01:56,191
"Rat on your Pop,
and Keyser Soze will get you. "

773
01:01:56,858 --> 01:02:00,779
- And no on ever really believes.
- Do you believe in him, Verbal?

774
01:02:03,656 --> 01:02:07,076
Keaton always said:
"I don't believe in God,

775
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,204
but I'm afraid of him".

776
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,832
Well I believe in God...

777
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:17,587
and the only thing that
scares me is Keyser Soze.

778
01:02:24,385 --> 01:02:26,304
Do you give any weight to this?

779
01:02:26,638 --> 01:02:30,433
Dan Metzheiser from Justice
has a file on Soze in D.C.

780
01:02:30,767 --> 01:02:35,772
It's his hobby. Guys equate him
to that reporter on Incredible Hulk.

781
01:02:41,361 --> 01:02:45,615
- You've heard of him?
- On the street, a few times.

782
01:02:45,782 --> 01:02:47,117
Outside stuff.

783
01:02:47,575 --> 01:02:52,205
Somebody working for a guy
who got money from Keyser Soze.

784
01:02:53,957 --> 01:02:56,376
It could be an old badge,
a hex sign.

785
01:02:56,543 --> 01:02:58,795
When a name meant something.

786
01:02:59,504 --> 01:03:01,714
- But you're here.
- Well, shit yeah.

787
01:03:01,881 --> 01:03:05,510
A burnt guy tries to walk out of
hospital because he's afraid of Soze.

788
01:03:06,386 --> 01:03:08,471
I'll run it up the flagpole.

789
01:03:10,265 --> 01:03:12,559
I told you like it happened.

790
01:03:12,725 --> 01:03:17,480
So I left out how I got there?
D.A. Would have cut my amnesty.

791
01:03:17,689 --> 01:03:19,607
You got what you wanted
out of me. So big fucking deal.

792
01:03:19,774 --> 01:03:22,694
- That's why you never told the D. A?
- You tell me, Agent Kujan.

793
01:03:22,986 --> 01:03:25,947
If I said the Loch Ness Monster
hired me, what would you say?

794
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:28,741
Turn state's evidence.

795
01:03:29,117 --> 01:03:31,244
I've got immunity now.
What can you possibly offer me?

796
01:03:31,536 --> 01:03:34,038
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come looking for you.

797
01:03:35,248 --> 01:03:36,875
Where's your head, Agent Kujan?

798
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:39,127
Where do you think
the pressure's coming from?

799
01:03:39,294 --> 01:03:42,213
Keyser Soze knows where
I am right now.

800
01:03:42,547 --> 01:03:46,134
He's got you to let me go so
he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.

801
01:03:46,468 --> 01:03:50,430
Immunity was to deal with you.
I got problems when I post bail.

802
01:03:50,722 --> 01:03:52,640
Why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

803
01:03:53,558 --> 01:03:54,893
Thanks, Dave.

804
01:03:55,185 --> 01:03:57,729
Bang-up job so far:
Extortion, coercion.

805
01:03:57,979 --> 01:03:59,773
Pardon me, but kiss my pucker.

806
01:04:00,064 --> 01:04:04,444
The same fuckers that rounded
us up are now bailing me out?

807
01:04:06,738 --> 01:04:09,282
Think you can catch Keyser Soze?

808
01:04:09,616 --> 01:04:13,828
You think a guy like that gets
close to sticking his head out?

809
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:18,208
If he comes up, it'll be to get me.
And after that...

810
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:22,212
you'll never hear from him again.

811
01:04:44,275 --> 01:04:46,069
What happened next?

812
01:04:46,361 --> 01:04:48,488
We woke up and Fenster was gone.

813
01:04:48,822 --> 01:04:51,324
He didn't like slumming for Soze.

814
01:04:51,699 --> 01:04:55,829
He left a good luck note
and took a chunk of the money.

815
01:04:56,621 --> 01:04:59,207
- Then what?
- McManus was furious.

816
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:03,294
He talked about tracking him
down and ripping his heart out.

817
01:05:04,504 --> 01:05:06,339
That night we got the call.

818
01:05:07,006 --> 01:05:07,924
What call?

819
01:05:08,299 --> 01:05:11,010
Kobayashi told us where
we could find Fenster.

820
01:05:18,726 --> 01:05:21,146
Let's get the fuck out of here.

821
01:05:22,814 --> 01:05:24,607
We got to bury him.

822
01:05:24,899 --> 01:05:28,111
- With what?
- With our hands.

823
01:05:37,954 --> 01:05:39,164
This is nuts.

824
01:05:39,873 --> 01:05:44,711
It's dry sand. When he rots,
surfers will smell him a mile away.

825
01:05:45,211 --> 01:05:46,254
Dig, you fuck.

826
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:48,965
What are we gonna do?
This guy is gonna kill us.

827
01:05:49,257 --> 01:05:52,719
I don't know about you, pegleg,
but I got no problem running.

828
01:05:53,845 --> 01:05:56,848
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have
a problem with it either.

829
01:05:58,016 --> 01:06:02,145
If you run, we'll be digging
a hole for you. You got that?

830
01:06:02,937 --> 01:06:06,566
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody.

831
01:06:07,192 --> 01:06:10,820
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for 5 years.

832
01:06:11,154 --> 01:06:16,034
We did more jobs and saw more
money than you can count.

833
01:06:16,868 --> 01:06:18,119
'Cause now it's payback!

834
01:06:18,286 --> 01:06:19,621
It's not payback.

835
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:26,127
It's precaution. You want payback
or run away? I don't care.

836
01:06:30,465 --> 01:06:32,425
I'm not doing this for Fenster.

837
01:06:33,468 --> 01:06:35,178
I'm not doing it for you.

838
01:06:36,888 --> 01:06:38,473
I'm doing this for me.

839
01:06:40,475 --> 01:06:42,560
I'm gonna to finish this thing.

840
01:06:43,103 --> 01:06:46,815
This Kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

841
01:07:07,544 --> 01:07:09,754
After they killed Fenster,
nobody would run?

842
01:07:10,046 --> 01:07:13,675
- I wanted to.
- Why didn't you say anything?

843
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:17,804
I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.
It was too far-fetched for him.

844
01:07:18,096 --> 01:07:20,682
Keaton was a grounded guy,
an ex cop.

845
01:07:21,015 --> 01:07:25,145
To a cop, the explanation
is always simple.

846
01:07:25,812 --> 01:07:28,356
There's no mystery to the street,
no arch-criminal behind it.

847
01:07:28,606 --> 01:07:31,860
You got a dead body and you think
his brother did it, you're right.

848
01:07:32,235 --> 01:07:35,989
Nobody argued with Keaton.
They set about whacking Kobayashi.

849
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:47,751
They're coming up.

850
01:07:49,544 --> 01:07:51,546
<i>You hear me? He's coming up.</i>

851
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,339
He's on his way down.

852
01:08:50,105 --> 01:08:51,648
Don't move.

853
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:54,359
Press 20. Do it now.

854
01:09:14,337 --> 01:09:15,672
Move!

855
01:09:18,758 --> 01:09:20,093
The answer is no.

856
01:09:20,593 --> 01:09:22,053
Mr. Soze will be most...

857
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:25,932
There is no Soze. Mention his
name again and I'll kill you.

858
01:09:26,266 --> 01:09:30,437
A strange threat. I assume you've
come here to kill me anyway.

859
01:09:36,067 --> 01:09:38,820
We know that you
can get to us.

860
01:09:39,362 --> 01:09:41,364
But now you know
we can get to you.

861
01:09:42,657 --> 01:09:45,535
I'm giving you one last chance
to call this off.

862
01:09:45,869 --> 01:09:50,623
My employer's made up his mind.
He does not change it.

863
01:09:50,915 --> 01:09:51,958
Neither do we.

864
01:09:52,792 --> 01:09:55,587
You got Fenster, but you won't
be able to get all of us.

865
01:09:55,754 --> 01:09:57,505
Not before one of us gets you.

866
01:09:57,756 --> 01:10:01,009
I believe you, I sincerely do.

867
01:10:01,968 --> 01:10:04,596
You would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable.

868
01:10:04,929 --> 01:10:06,473
But I cannot make this decision.

869
01:10:07,015 --> 01:10:10,935
Whatever you threaten me with
is ludicrous in comparison to

870
01:10:11,227 --> 01:10:14,397
what will be done to me if I do not
carry out my orders in full.

871
01:10:21,863 --> 01:10:23,865
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

872
01:10:25,992 --> 01:10:28,369
I just wanted you to know that.

873
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,498
I'm so sorry, Mr. McManus.

874
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:36,377
I implore you, believe me.
Mr. Soze is very real.

875
01:10:36,961 --> 01:10:39,464
- And very determined.
- We'll see.

876
01:10:46,805 --> 01:10:50,183
Before you do me in,
Mr. McManus,

877
01:10:50,683 --> 01:10:54,229
will you let me finish my
business with Miss Finneran?

878
01:10:59,526 --> 01:11:01,069
What did you say?

879
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:06,032
Edie Finneran. She's upstairs,
in my office

880
01:11:06,407 --> 01:11:09,577
for an extradition deposition.

881
01:11:09,911 --> 01:11:12,497
I requested her personally.

882
01:11:12,789 --> 01:11:13,915
She flew in yesterday.

883
01:11:16,584 --> 01:11:20,171
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.

884
01:11:24,968 --> 01:11:26,428
You're lying.

885
01:11:27,095 --> 01:11:28,054
Am I?

886
01:11:45,613 --> 01:11:48,074
Her escort while she's here

887
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:51,161
in Los Angeles.
Never leaves her side.

888
01:11:51,453 --> 01:11:54,497
She's in good hands.

889
01:11:58,668 --> 01:12:01,504
Get some rest. The boat will be
ready for you on Friday.

890
01:12:01,796 --> 01:12:04,299
If I see you or any of
your friends before then,

891
01:12:04,632 --> 01:12:08,887
she will be the victim of
a gruesome violation before dying.

892
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:11,806
As indeed will your father,
Mr. Hockney,

893
01:12:12,307 --> 01:12:15,435
and your Uncle Randall
in Arizona, Mr. Kint.

894
01:12:16,102 --> 01:12:20,106
I might only castrate
Mr. McManus' nephew, David.

895
01:12:22,442 --> 01:12:24,360
Do I make myself clear?

896
01:12:24,903 --> 01:12:29,574
Take care of the bodies.
Add it the cost of Mr. Fenster.

897
01:12:30,533 --> 01:12:32,118
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

898
01:13:11,074 --> 01:13:12,659
It's a logistical nightmare.

899
01:13:13,493 --> 01:13:16,329
Close quarters,
ten maybe twenty men.

900
01:13:16,704 --> 01:13:19,249
No telling how many below deck.

901
01:13:19,582 --> 01:13:21,918
- Can we stealth these guys?
- No.

902
01:13:22,252 --> 01:13:24,838
With all that coke,
they're gonna be ready.

903
01:13:26,005 --> 01:13:28,883
Now sunny point number two.

904
01:13:29,467 --> 01:13:32,429
If one of us gets through and
jacks the boat, we still got nothing.

905
01:13:32,804 --> 01:13:34,681
What if we wait for the money?

906
01:13:35,348 --> 01:13:37,016
Ten more men at least.

907
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,645
In my opinion, it can't be done.

908
01:13:40,979 --> 01:13:43,022
No one comes out alive.

909
01:13:43,356 --> 01:13:44,649
I'm gonna wait for the money.

910
01:13:45,525 --> 01:13:47,861
- Me too.
- Didn't you hear what he said?

911
01:13:48,445 --> 01:13:50,613
- Lf I'm going in, I want a cut.
- Me too.

912
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:54,659
There's nothing that can't be done.

913
01:13:57,537 --> 01:14:00,373
We're walking into certain death.

914
01:14:07,464 --> 01:14:10,341
The news said it's raining
in New York.

915
01:14:31,946 --> 01:14:34,699
- What language is that?
- I don't know.

916
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,160
Russian, I think.

917
01:14:38,578 --> 01:14:40,121
Hungarian?

918
01:15:44,436 --> 01:15:47,313
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

919
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:07,834
You kids ready?

920
01:16:08,376 --> 01:16:10,420
I would be if I didn't have to
stop and answer you.

921
01:16:11,504 --> 01:16:13,673
I'm ready. McManus...

922
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,467
<i>you better be set up in 10 seconds.</i>

923
01:16:17,844 --> 01:16:19,137
I'm ready.

924
01:16:20,722 --> 01:16:22,390
I want you to stay here.

925
01:16:23,683 --> 01:16:25,018
I'm supposed to cover...

926
01:16:25,351 --> 01:16:27,979
If I don't get out of this, I want
you to take the money and go.

927
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:33,234
Tell Edie what happened.
She knows people and what to do.

928
01:16:33,568 --> 01:16:36,696
If I don't get Kobayashi,
she'll get him her way.

929
01:16:36,863 --> 01:16:39,157
- What if I?
- Just do what I say.

930
01:16:39,783 --> 01:16:41,409
Please.

931
01:16:44,454 --> 01:16:45,580
Tell her that...

932
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,294
Tell her I tried.

933
01:17:04,432 --> 01:17:06,810
<i>McManus, he's on his way.</i>

934
01:17:07,185 --> 01:17:08,520
I'm there.

935
01:18:00,738 --> 01:18:04,325
One, two, three, four...

936
01:18:05,034 --> 01:18:07,787
five, six, seven.

937
01:18:09,038 --> 01:18:11,082
Oswald was a fag.

938
01:18:20,925 --> 01:18:22,385
Hi. How you doing?

939
01:18:25,638 --> 01:18:27,223
Is there a problem?

940
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:54,292
Now.

941
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:27,367
Old MacDonald had a farm.

942
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:35,333
And on this farm he shot some guys.

943
01:20:08,992 --> 01:20:10,493
Elvis has left the building.

944
01:22:33,511 --> 01:22:35,013
Why didn't you run?

945
01:22:35,638 --> 01:22:37,015
I froze up.

946
01:22:37,974 --> 01:22:40,727
I thought about how Fenster
looked when we buried him.

947
01:22:41,436 --> 01:22:44,522
And then about Keaton.
Looked like he might pull it off.

948
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:56,117
A boy found a body on the beach
shot twice in the head.

949
01:22:56,409 --> 01:22:59,079
- The Bureau identified him.
- What else?

950
01:22:59,245 --> 01:23:02,290
Arturo Marquez, a petty smuggler
from Argentina.

951
01:23:02,624 --> 01:23:06,961
Arrested, New York, for trafficking.
He escapes to California.

952
01:23:07,295 --> 01:23:12,258
Picked up on Long Beach, they set up
extradition, he escapes again.

953
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:17,680
Get this. Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

954
01:23:18,014 --> 01:23:18,973
Kobayashi.

955
01:23:19,182 --> 01:23:22,352
New York faxed a copy of
his testimony. He was a rat.

956
01:23:22,644 --> 01:23:26,606
- Yeah, a big fucking rat.
- He opposed returning to prison.

957
01:23:27,065 --> 01:23:30,693
So he named close to fifty people.

958
01:23:31,236 --> 01:23:32,987
Guess who he named in the finale.

959
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:35,907
Keyser Soze.

960
01:23:36,116 --> 01:23:37,534
There's more.

961
01:23:49,629 --> 01:23:53,466
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

962
01:23:55,427 --> 01:23:57,929
There was no dope on that boat.

963
01:24:39,471 --> 01:24:41,014
You, stay quiet.

964
01:24:41,264 --> 01:24:44,184
He's here. I know he's here.

965
01:24:44,642 --> 01:24:46,936
That's him. I'm telling you.

966
01:24:47,228 --> 01:24:48,938
I know he's here.

967
01:24:50,231 --> 01:24:53,860
- You can't understand. That's him!
- Shut up!

968
01:24:54,694 --> 01:24:58,198
I tell you it's Keyser Soze!

969
01:26:56,024 --> 01:26:57,817
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know.

970
01:26:58,151 --> 01:27:00,528
- There's no coke.
- What?

971
01:27:00,737 --> 01:27:04,908
There's no coke. I've been up
and down this ship,

972
01:27:05,241 --> 01:27:09,079
in every fucking room.
There is nothing!

973
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:10,580
Nothing!

974
01:27:11,206 --> 01:27:12,665
Don't fuck with me.

975
01:27:12,832 --> 01:27:16,586
There is no fucking coke!

976
01:27:27,472 --> 01:27:28,932
I'm out of here.

977
01:28:10,098 --> 01:28:12,142
I told them nothing.

978
01:28:13,017 --> 01:28:14,477
I swear.

979
01:28:15,019 --> 01:28:17,730
I told them nothing.
Please.

980
01:29:03,777 --> 01:29:04,819
McManus.

981
01:29:05,236 --> 01:29:06,654
What the fuck is going on?

982
01:29:09,365 --> 01:29:10,784
The strangest thing.

983
01:30:05,964 --> 01:30:09,134
It's in your statement: You saw
a man in a suit with a slim build.

984
01:30:09,426 --> 01:30:10,760
- Wait a minute.
- I don't have a minute.

985
01:30:11,094 --> 01:30:14,806
You saw Soze and told the DA
you didn't know who it was?

986
01:30:14,973 --> 01:30:19,060
- There was dope on that boat.
- You know what I'm getting at.

987
01:30:19,227 --> 01:30:20,895
- Get out of my face.
- You know.

988
01:30:21,062 --> 01:30:22,564
I've got immunity.
I don't have to take that shit.

989
01:30:22,730 --> 01:30:26,109
- You know what I'm getting at.
- I don't know.

990
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:27,485
The truth.

991
01:30:27,986 --> 01:30:30,280
Try to tell me you saw
someone kill Keaton.

992
01:30:30,447 --> 01:30:32,699
- I did.
- You are lying to me.

993
01:30:33,158 --> 01:30:35,368
You've known this whole time.

994
01:30:35,702 --> 01:30:38,580
I don't know what you're saying.
I did see Keaton get shot.

995
01:30:38,872 --> 01:30:41,833
Then why didn't you help him?
You had a gun.

996
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,084
He was your friend.

997
01:30:47,505 --> 01:30:49,299
Because I was of afraid.

998
01:30:50,175 --> 01:30:51,134
Okay?

999
01:30:51,801 --> 01:30:53,553
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

1000
01:30:55,305 --> 01:30:57,098
I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1001
01:30:57,849 --> 01:31:01,686
It was Keyser Soze,
the Devil himself.

1002
01:31:02,979 --> 01:31:05,607
How do you shoot the Devil
in the back?

1003
01:31:09,944 --> 01:31:11,821
What if you miss?

1004
01:31:16,451 --> 01:31:19,204
Let's get back to the pier.

1005
01:32:42,162 --> 01:32:45,540
- Ever hear of Arturo Marquez?
- What? No.

1006
01:32:45,915 --> 01:32:49,669
<i>He was a stool pigeon for
the Justice Dept. He swore</i>

1007
01:32:50,003 --> 01:32:54,466
to Federal Marshals that he
had seen and could identify

1008
01:32:54,758 --> 01:32:56,217
<i>one Keyser Soze.</i>

1009
01:32:56,384 --> 01:32:57,552
It says right here in the report.

1010
01:32:57,844 --> 01:33:02,265
He had knowledge of his business,
including drug trafficking

1011
01:33:02,432 --> 01:33:05,393
- and murder.
- I never heard of him.

1012
01:33:05,935 --> 01:33:07,270
His people were selling him

1013
01:33:07,437 --> 01:33:08,480
<i>to a gang of Hungarians.</i>

1014
01:33:08,813 --> 01:33:12,317
<i>Most likely the ones that Soze
all but wiped out in Turkey.</i>

1015
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:16,905
The money wasn't for dope.
They were buying the one guy

1016
01:33:17,071 --> 01:33:18,990
<i>that could incriminate Soze.</i>

1017
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,576
- I said I never heard of him.
- But Keaton did.

1018
01:33:21,868 --> 01:33:24,579
<i>Edie Finneran was
Marquez's extradition advisor.</i>

1019
01:33:24,871 --> 01:33:26,623
<i>She knew who he was
and what he knew.</i>

1020
01:33:27,457 --> 01:33:30,460
There were no drugs on that boat.
It was a hit...

1021
01:33:30,919 --> 01:33:33,421
a suicide mission to whack out

1022
01:33:33,588 --> 01:33:35,715
<i>the guy that could finger Soze.</i>

1023
01:33:36,049 --> 01:33:40,553
<i>Soze sent men in that he could
march into certain death.</i>

1024
01:33:40,845 --> 01:33:43,598
Soze sent us to kill someone?

1025
01:33:44,516 --> 01:33:47,268
<i>I'm saying Keaton did.
He left you behind for a reason.</i>

1026
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,145
Just do what I tell you.

1027
01:33:49,479 --> 01:33:52,315
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere,

1028
01:33:52,607 --> 01:33:56,111
why give you the money to run?
He could've used you on the boat.

1029
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:58,029
He wanted me to live.

1030
01:33:59,656 --> 01:34:03,284
<i>A dirty cop without loyalties</i>

1031
01:34:03,576 --> 01:34:05,703
<i>finds it in his heart to save
a worthless rat cripple?</i>

1032
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:07,205
No sir! Why?

1033
01:34:08,081 --> 01:34:08,832
Edie!

1034
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,751
<i>I don't buy that reformed story.</i>

1035
01:34:12,043 --> 01:34:16,256
Even if I did, I don't believe
he'd send you to protect her.

1036
01:34:17,006 --> 01:34:18,466
So why?

1037
01:34:20,635 --> 01:34:23,805
- Because he was my friend.
- No, Verbal.

1038
01:34:24,139 --> 01:34:27,016
He wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.

1039
01:34:27,183 --> 01:34:28,226
What are you doing here?

1040
01:34:28,393 --> 01:34:29,394
<i>He saved you</i>

1041
01:34:29,561 --> 01:34:32,188
because he wanted it that way.
It was his will.

1042
01:34:32,647 --> 01:34:34,691
Keaton was Keyser Soze!

1043
01:34:35,567 --> 01:34:36,526
<i>The kind of man</i>

1044
01:34:36,693 --> 01:34:37,527
who could wrangle

1045
01:34:37,694 --> 01:34:38,987
<i>the wills of men like
Hockney and McManus,</i>

1046
01:34:39,154 --> 01:34:41,740
and engineer a police lineup

1047
01:34:42,282 --> 01:34:44,242
through all his years
of contacts in NYPD.

1048
01:34:44,409 --> 01:34:47,036
The kind of man who
could've killed Edie Finnerman.

1049
01:34:52,083 --> 01:34:54,961
She was found yesterday in a hotel.

1050
01:34:55,128 --> 01:34:56,671
Shot twice in the head.

1051
01:35:01,509 --> 01:35:04,220
What do you think about Keaton now?

1052
01:35:05,818 --> 01:35:06,862
Edie?

1053
01:35:07,029 --> 01:35:10,741
He used all of you
to get him on the boat.

1054
01:35:09,114 --> 01:35:12,826
<i>He couldn't get on alone.
He had to pull the trigger</i>

1055
01:35:13,077 --> 01:35:16,997
to make sure he got the one man
who could identify him.

1056
01:35:17,957 --> 01:35:21,251
- This is all bullshit.
- You said you saw him die.

1057
01:35:24,463 --> 01:35:25,422
<i>Or did you?</i>

1058
01:35:25,589 --> 01:35:27,800
You had to hide when you
first heard the police cars.

1059
01:35:28,092 --> 01:35:30,469
<i>You said you heard the shot
before the fire,</i>

1060
01:35:30,844 --> 01:35:32,346
but you didn't see him die.

1061
01:35:33,055 --> 01:35:35,808
- He would never...
- He programmed you

1062
01:35:36,308 --> 01:35:40,563
<i>to tell us what he wanted.
He knew we were close.</i>

1063
01:35:40,939 --> 01:35:43,483
<i>Why the political pressure?</i>

1064
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:45,151
Why were you protected?
It was Keaton.

1065
01:35:45,318 --> 01:35:48,488
- Immunity was your reward.
- But why me?

1066
01:35:49,322 --> 01:35:52,033
Why not Fenster or McManus
or Hockney?

1067
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,119
I'm stupid. I'm a cripple.

1068
01:35:54,286 --> 01:35:55,829
Because you're a cripple.

1069
01:35:55,996 --> 01:35:57,372
Because you're stupid.

1070
01:35:57,998 --> 01:36:00,375
Because you're weaker than them.

1071
01:36:04,421 --> 01:36:05,7143
If he's dead,

1072
01:36:06,047 --> 01:36:08,050
if what you say is true,

1073
01:36:08,342 --> 01:36:10,094
then it won't matter.

1074
01:36:11,512 --> 01:36:14,348
It was his idea to hit
the Taxi Service, wasn't it?

1075
01:36:14,682 --> 01:36:17,852
- Tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.

1076
01:36:19,103 --> 01:36:22,106
We followed him
from the beginning.

1077
01:36:23,482 --> 01:36:24,567
I didn't know.

1078
01:36:25,067 --> 01:36:26,610
I saw him die.

1079
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:30,906
I believe he's dead. Christ!

1080
01:36:32,074 --> 01:36:33,701
You're not safe on your own.

1081
01:36:37,623 --> 01:36:39,041
You think he's?

1082
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:40,500
Keyser Soze?

1083
01:36:41,585 --> 01:36:43,211
I don't know, Verbal.

1084
01:36:44,671 --> 01:36:48,383
Keyser Soze's a shield.
Or like you said, a spook story.

1085
01:36:49,718 --> 01:36:53,639
But I know Keaton, and someone
is pulling strings for you.

1086
01:36:54,222 --> 01:36:55,349
Stay here and let us protect you.

1087
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:59,394
- I'm not bait. I post today.
- You posted 20 minutes ago.

1088
01:36:59,853 --> 01:37:03,065
Captain Leo wants you out,
unless you turn state's.

1089
01:37:03,398 --> 01:37:05,233
I'll take my chances.

1090
01:37:05,692 --> 01:37:08,780
If someone wants to,
they'll get you out there.

1091
01:37:09,155 --> 01:37:12,533
Testify. You might not see trial.

1092
01:37:12,825 --> 01:37:14,035
Maybe so.

1093
01:37:15,578 --> 01:37:18,164
But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.

1094
01:37:34,263 --> 01:37:35,598
Fucking cops.

1095
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:02,960
Excuse me. Can I use your fax?

1096
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:09,759
Sign for these, Mr. Kint.

1097
01:38:11,553 --> 01:38:15,557
One watch, gold.
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1098
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:18,893
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1099
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:21,438
We still got nothing, Dave.

1100
01:38:21,771 --> 01:38:24,024
I know what I wanted about Keaton.

1101
01:38:24,316 --> 01:38:25,817
Which is nothing.

1102
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:29,779
No matter. He must know
how close we came.

1103
01:38:30,113 --> 01:38:34,075
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze,
if Keaton is alive,

1104
01:38:34,451 --> 01:38:35,994
he's not coming up again.

1105
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:37,787
I'll find him.

1106
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:40,583
Waste of time.

1107
01:38:43,085 --> 01:38:45,379
A rumor is not a rumor
that doesn't die.

1108
01:38:46,047 --> 01:38:46,881
What?

1109
01:38:48,174 --> 01:38:49,050
Nothing.

1110
01:38:51,010 --> 01:38:52,219
Man, you're a slob.

1111
01:38:53,054 --> 01:38:55,139
Yes, but it all has a system, Dave.

1112
01:38:56,307 --> 01:38:59,977
To make sense of it,
you got to stand back.

1113
01:39:01,937 --> 01:39:05,149
Want to see a real horror show?
See my garage.

1114
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,856
<i>Convince me.</i>

1115
01:39:44,649 --> 01:39:47,068
<i>When I was in a barbershop
quartet in Skokie Illinois...</i>

1116
01:39:47,318 --> 01:39:48,820
<i>Where's your head, Agent Kujan?</i>

1117
01:39:49,028 --> 01:39:51,322
<i>What we need to do
is think back.</i>

1118
01:39:51,489 --> 01:39:53,491
<i>I'm sure you've heard tall tales.</i>

1119
01:39:53,658 --> 01:39:54,534
<i>This isn't right.</i>

1120
01:39:56,035 --> 01:39:57,161
<i>It's all there.</i>

1121
01:39:57,328 --> 01:39:58,746
<i>I'm telling it straight, I swear.</i>

1122
01:39:58,913 --> 01:40:00,873
<i>Some guy in California. Redfoot.</i>

1123
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,208
<i>A gift from Mr. Soze.</i>

1124
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:04,085
<i>Talk to me, Verbal.
What about Redfoot?</i>

1125
01:40:04,252 --> 01:40:06,087
<i>Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.</i>

1126
01:40:06,254 --> 01:40:09,590
<i>Baritone was a big fat guy.</i>

1127
01:40:11,176 --> 01:40:11,969
<i>...never seen again.</i>

1128
01:40:13,137 --> 01:40:16,432
<i>...picking beans in Guatemala.</i>

1129
01:40:16,765 --> 01:40:19,435
<i>- You thought he was a good man.
- I know he was good.</i>

1130
01:40:23,731 --> 01:40:24,815
<i>The strangest thing.</i>

1131
01:40:24,982 --> 01:40:26,525
<i>How do you shoot the Devil
in the back?</i>

1132
01:40:26,692 --> 01:40:30,321
<i>...protected from on high
by the Prince of...</i>

1133
01:40:30,487 --> 01:40:32,197
<i>What's your story, pretzel man?</i>

1134
01:40:32,364 --> 01:40:34,366
<i>- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer, Verbal?</i>

1135
01:40:34,575 --> 01:40:36,076
<i>I am Mr. Kobayashi.</i>

1136
01:40:37,578 --> 01:40:39,330
<i>Convince me.</i>

1137
01:40:57,932 --> 01:41:01,269
<i>Every creep will know the name</i>

1138
01:41:01,436 --> 01:41:02,687
<i>of Verbal Kint.</i>

1139
01:41:03,146 --> 01:41:06,483
The cripple, did you see him?
Which way did he go?

1140
01:41:06,775 --> 01:41:07,776
He went out that way.

1141
01:41:08,234 --> 01:41:09,736
<i>I know you know something.</i>

1142
01:41:10,779 --> 01:41:12,615
<i>I'm smarter than you.
And I'll find out</i>

1143
01:41:12,782 --> 01:41:14,909
<i>what I want, whether you
like it or not.</i>

1144
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:18,371
<i>You know what I'm getting at!
The truth!</i>

1145
01:41:21,165 --> 01:41:23,751
<i>Somebody with power,
capable of...</i>

1146
01:41:23,918 --> 01:41:25,753
<i>I'm talking about Keyser Soze!</i>

1147
01:41:26,879 --> 01:41:31,175
<i>You think a guy like that gets
close to sticking his head out?</i>

1148
01:41:32,677 --> 01:41:35,805
<i>Because you're stupid.
Because you're a cripple.</i>

1149
01:41:37,348 --> 01:41:39,850
<i>You've known the whole time!</i>

1150
01:41:44,272 --> 01:41:47,359
<i>I can't feel my legs, Keyser.</i>

1151
01:41:47,526 --> 01:41:51,029
<i>First thing I learned on the job
was how to spot a murderer.</i>

1152
01:41:51,238 --> 01:41:52,990
<i>You got the cripple from New York.</i>

1153
01:41:53,657 --> 01:41:55,826
<i>- Did he mention Keyser Soze?
- Who?</i>

1154
01:41:56,618 --> 01:42:00,664
<i>You'll never hear from him again.</i>

1155
01:42:21,985 --> 01:42:24,154
<i>The greatest trick
the Devil ever pulled...</i>

1156
01:42:24,446 --> 01:42:26,907
<i>was convincing the world
he didn't exist.</i>

1157
01:42:29,034 --> 01:42:30,285
<i>And like that...</i>

1158
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:32,996
<i>he's gone.
