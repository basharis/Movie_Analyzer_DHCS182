1
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:40,243
As far as I can remember,

2
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:42,006
I've hated christmas.

3
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:50,126
What does it say, christian?

4
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:52,255
Gimme my car!

5
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,556
Christmas 1960

6
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:57,398
It should work.

7
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,597
Stop picking your nose.

8
00:00:59,774 --> 00:01:01,173
It's working!

9
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:04,473
There we go.

10
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:06,672
Mine's not moving.

11
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:09,685
Gervais!

12
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:12,850
Han?

13
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:18,769
How are you feeling?

14
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,914
He's so cute!
Look, kids.

15
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,109
It's your little brother!

16
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,148
- Baby Jesus!
- Let me hold him.

17
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:29,849
Here you go.

18
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:31,790
He's beautiful.

19
00:02:33,164 --> 00:02:34,564
Let me see!

20
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,605
Christmas 1966

21
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:49,612
Not only would my birthday
always go unnoticed,

22
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:52,277
but it had to start
with midnight mass.

23
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:17,980
Midnight mass is too long!

24
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:21,958
Go home and open your presents!

25
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,890
On the contrary, you're lucky
to share his birthday.

26
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:50,895
That doesn't happen
to just anyone.

27
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,899
It's special.

28
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,971
Hence the birthmark
on your scalp. Hmm?

29
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,132
It's a sign of being gifted,
you know.

30
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,146
At least, after mass,

31
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:11,851
there was the christmas Eve party
at Grandma's.

32
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:19,605
Hello, my beautiful Zac.

33
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,542
The only advantage to having
one's birthday on christmas

34
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:26,305
was getting a bigger present
than everyone else.

35
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:39,088
He likes it, huh?

36
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:44,168
But I especially hated christmas
because I never got what I wanted.

37
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,365
Dammit.

38
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:49,103
It's what he wanted.

39
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,337
So? It's not up to him.

40
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:54,006
You want to turn him into a fairy?

41
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:57,018
- Stop it. He's only five!
- He's almost six and looks seven.

42
00:04:57,188 --> 00:04:59,349
- Oh, come on!
- Never mind "come on."

43
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:01,925
Now return it. Go on.

44
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,612
It would make you
a laughingstock, son.

45
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:19,614
Daddy doesn't want that.

46
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:31,124
Daddy isn't trying to upset you.

47
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,962
He loves you far too much.

48
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:35,469
Hence the hockey game.

49
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,131
So he can play with you.

50
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,300
Go to sleep.

51
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:42,241
Mommy will have a nice surprise

52
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:43,846
for you soon.

53
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:46,508
- For my birthday?
- No, after. You'll see.

54
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:48,154
Go to sleep.

55
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:56,222
What's a fairy?

56
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,972
Nothing.

57
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:04,803
Hogwash.

58
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:06,446
Go to sleep.

59
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,208
Idiot.

60
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:16,986
I knew very well
what a fairy was.

61
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:20,054
I especially knew...

62
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,299
I didn't want to be one.

63
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:35,650
Want to play, Zac?

64
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,286
No.

65
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:49,226
Unlike my friends' fathers,

66
00:06:49,404 --> 00:06:51,839
all of whom
were ordinary and uninteresting,

67
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:54,739
mine was the best in the world.

68
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:57,003
He has Patsy cline's,
Buddy Rich's

69
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,545
and Aznavour's
entire collections.

70
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:01,184
He fired a machine gun
in the army.

71
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,153
Our secret side trips
to Norm The King Of Fries

72
00:07:57,325 --> 00:07:59,124
made me deliriously happy.

73
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:02,233
For a few precious moments,
I was his favourite.

74
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:04,231
Take me

75
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:06,235
To the ends of the earth

76
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:07,771
Take me

77
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:10,240
To Wonderland

78
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:11,741
It seems to me

79
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:14,074
That misery

80
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:16,582
Would be borne more easily
under the sun

81
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:27,420
Hi!

82
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,931
Hello.

83
00:08:29,102 --> 00:08:31,094
- You didn't bring any back?
- What?

84
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:32,466
Fries, you moron.

85
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,402
You can smell it a mile away.

86
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:37,010
We didn't have any fries.

87
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:39,512
Did we?

88
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:44,712
My three brothers were morons.

89
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:47,086
Starting with christian,

90
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,420
the egghead,

91
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,926
who read constantly -

92
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,725
anything, anytime, anywhere;

93
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,003
Antoine, the sports nut,
a walking stinkbomb;

94
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:02,501
- What're you looking at?
- And Raymond,

95
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,045
my sworn enemy.

96
00:09:05,316 --> 00:09:06,375
Get lost, you pisser.

97
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:09,715
Dad, Raymond called me
a pussy!

98
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,789
Not a pussy, a pisser.

99
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,028
Kitchen.

100
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:20,401
I could understand him

101
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:22,266
being proud of christian,
or Antoine.

102
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,102
But Raymond?

103
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:34,247
Aren't you going to introduce us?

104
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:36,550
My dad.

105
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:41,062
- You're going out, Raymond?
- The little bastard's a casanova.

106
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:43,723
But he asked
for more ironed toast!

107
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,100
Hi, pretty baby.

108
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:51,836
After nine months of prayer...

109
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,715
and superhuman feats...

110
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:59,020
the good Lord
would finally give me...

111
00:09:59,188 --> 00:10:00,212
Another boy?

112
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,689
What kind of lead you got
in your pencil, Beaulieu?

113
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,763
What can I say?
I have a surplus of male hormones.

114
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:07,422
- A surplus of hormones!
- That's irrelevant.

115
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,431
He has to change positions

116
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:10,934
once in a while.

117
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:13,198
Yeah, well, I've tried that.

118
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,467
What can I say? Five boys -
you take what you can get.

119
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:24,710
Come on, Zac.

120
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:44,172
You like my surprise?

121
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:19,058
Christmas 1967

122
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:43,055
Take me

123
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:44,818
To the ends of the earth

124
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,394
Take me

125
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:48,055
To Wonderland

126
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:51,930
It seems to me that misery

127
00:11:52,104 --> 00:11:54,370
Would be borne more easily
under the sun

128
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,567
Drop by sometime.

129
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:07,888
See? Look. Again.

130
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,392
Zac has a gift.
I'm sure of it.

131
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,089
His colic stops
whenever Zac holds him.

132
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,901
I'll go see Mrs. What's-her-name,
the Tupperware lady.

133
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,561
She, too, has a gift.

134
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,733
She can staunch bleeding,
heal burns and everything.

135
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:23,902
She'll tell us if he's gifted.

136
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,572
No. You've seen
how he plays the drums.

137
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,740
A regular little Buddy Rich.

138
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:33,086
Music runs in his blood,
I'm telling you. That's his gift.

139
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,694
He gets that from his old man.

140
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:25,784
Hi, pretty baby.

141
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:28,864
Mommy's little darling.

142
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:38,639
I can still remember the snow
slowly melting on his face.

143
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:42,815
I had just turned seven
and, unwittingly,

144
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:44,949
declared war to my father.

145
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,131
Are you crazy,

146
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,969
dammit?!
What are you doing?!

147
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:03,233
Roll that window back up,
you nitwit!

148
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,470
Do we have to tie you up?

149
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:07,276
Here, buckle up!

150
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,619
Christ.

151
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,089
Use your head, you nitwit.

152
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:20,734
Stop slurping, you pig!
Don't be such a sissy!

153
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,335
Eleven bucks!

154
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:29,035
An imported collector's record.

155
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:32,947
You'll each reimburse me
if the guilty party

156
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:34,848
doesn't come forward.
I'm warning you.

157
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:37,616
I'll teach you to take
responsibility for your actions,

158
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,258
dammit!
- Gervais!

159
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:03,956
I didn't do it.

160
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:13,898
It was an accident.

161
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:18,737
Scoot, you three.

162
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:29,088
You'll not only pay for the record,
but your lies, too.

163
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:30,453
I'll teach you, you'll see.

164
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,117
Go to your room!

165
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,199
He said it was an accident.

166
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,978
What in heaven's name
did you do to him?

167
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:55,857
Zac. He's changed.

168
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:58,861
He's a crybaby, he dresses
like a girl. It's not normal.

169
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:01,024
Get over it.
It's you who's not normal.

170
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,637
He's a child, for God's sake.
Let him be.

171
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:05,774
"What did I do to him"!

172
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:12,612
- The others weren't like that.
- Each of them is different.

173
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:16,644
Zac is more gentle, that's all.
More sensitive.

174
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,790
He's not gentler, he's softer.

175
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:26,699
God, please don't let me be soft.

176
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:29,532
And return my dad
to his old self.

177
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:31,004
Shut up.

178
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:44,590
Use your head, you nitwit!
Don't be such a sissy!

179
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:51,063
I did it on purpose.

180
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:52,758
I'll tell Dad, you pisser.

181
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:29,613
When will I stop wetting the bed?
I've been asking him a long time.

182
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:32,447
Never mind - no harm done.

183
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:34,681
Hmm?
You're not alone.

184
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:36,985
It'll stop eventually.

185
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:40,830
Keep praying. You'll see,
Baby Jesus will hear you.

186
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:43,027
Especially you.

187
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:45,695
You were born on the same day.

188
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:47,342
Sweet dreams.

189
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:05,297
Big chimneys, huh?

190
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:08,429
Where are we going?

191
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:10,265
You'll see.

192
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,737
Careful.

193
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,927
Mrs. What's-her-name,
the Tupperware lady,

194
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:29,563
had realized my mother's dream:

195
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:33,011
She had walked
in christ's footsteps.

196
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,804
Try to trust your feelings.

197
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:43,709
You can feel things others can't.

198
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:47,953
You mustn't fear it.

199
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:53,421
He's been blessed
from on high, Mrs. Beaulieu.

200
00:18:53,596 --> 00:18:55,258
The good Lord chose him

201
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:58,403
knowing he was strong enough
for what's expected of him.

202
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,705
But give him a chance
to grow up a bit. Hmm?

203
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:04,469
So he better understands.

204
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:07,513
He's a good-looking boy.

205
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:09,241
He'll go far.

206
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,468
Christ...mas, I'm bushed!

207
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,951
I've got news for you.

208
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:19,597
Your son has a gift.

209
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:23,800
A family's seventh child
of the same sex is gifted.

210
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,769
With my three miscarriages,
that makes Zac seventh.

211
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:31,676
Who says your miscarriages
were boys?

212
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:35,481
They must've been.
That's all you can do.

213
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:37,814
We knew he could stop colic,
but he's otherwise gifted.

214
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:40,390
Gifted people
can pass their gift on to others,

215
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,291
if they're of the opposite sex
and not related.

216
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:46,728
Mrs. What's-her-name
passed all of hers on to him.

217
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,460
Oh, Jesus.

218
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:50,970
How much Tupperware
did that cost you?

219
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,041
None.
She didn't try selling me any.

220
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:56,371
I bought some.
It's different.

221
00:19:58,316 --> 00:19:59,613
This is no joke.

222
00:19:59,818 --> 00:20:01,843
He's truly gifted!

223
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:04,285
Can your gift cure my headache?

224
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,735
There.

225
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:22,878
What's this?

226
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:24,710
Look.

227
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:29,787
It's not my birthday,
as far as I know.

228
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,932
Your record's unfindable.
We bought another.

229
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:41,197
It's the same thing!

230
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,100
I know.
I already have this one.

231
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,179
The sound's not the same.

232
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,512
An imported collector's record
isn't the same.

233
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:55,055
It's the thought that counts.
I'll just return it, then.

234
00:20:58,763 --> 00:21:00,697
Raymond, Antoine!
That's enough!

235
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:02,264
Christian! Supper's ready.

236
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,374
Come on, boys. Let's eat.
- Coming.

237
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,410
Gifted...

238
00:21:12,614 --> 00:21:14,582
What do you think about that?

239
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:18,784
What did Mrs. What's-her-name
tell you?

240
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:20,787
I'm not allowed to say.

241
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,793
But she told Mom that if
the good Lord gave me a gift,

242
00:21:24,963 --> 00:21:26,625
I had to use it.

243
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,760
That I could help a lot of people,
even save them.

244
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:36,408
Tell him to think of him.

245
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:45,683
Think of Uncle Lucien.
He cut himself eating steak.

246
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:49,557
They're not going to start calling
for every little booboo?

247
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,191
Turn that music down.

248
00:21:55,838 --> 00:21:57,306
All I had to do

249
00:21:57,474 --> 00:22:00,410
was silently recite the secret
little prayers imparted to me

250
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:04,106
by Mrs. What's-her-name,
which consisted not of asking,

251
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:07,412
but of commanding God to heal.

252
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:12,757
Remember, you can't use
your gift for personal gain.

253
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:16,659
Or to harm others.

254
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,769
What a shame.

255
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:21,734
What's he saying?

256
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:25,341
He's not allowed to say.
Stop it, will you?

257
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:33,179
From now on, it'll cost a dime
every time you pick your nose.

258
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:35,220
You'll be rich.

259
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:37,860
You must know
how ketchup's made by now,

260
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:40,827
you've been reading the damn label
for half an hour.

261
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:49,400
Another pest
who just cut himself shaving.

262
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,169
Okay, I'll tell him.

263
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:58,444
Uncle Lucien's bleeding
has stopped.

264
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:12,131
Yes?

265
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,040
Well, I'll be damned.

266
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,642
Great. He'll be thrilled.

267
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,611
Yes. Thank you.

268
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:28,687
What is it?

269
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:30,591
Your lucky brother

270
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:33,759
is going to summer camp.
- What?!

271
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:36,336
I wasn't allowed to go at his age!

272
00:23:36,505 --> 00:23:38,338
You got yours.
Stop complaining.

273
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:40,807
We've never sent our children
to camp.

274
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:44,671
He'll sleep there?

275
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,514
Of course. He'll make friends,
have lots of fun...

276
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,883
It'll be a good experience
for him.

277
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:53,993
- He'll always remember it.
- I don't wanna go.

278
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:57,191
Oh, come on.

279
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:59,800
I don't wanna go.

280
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,280
I don't wanna go!!!

281
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,972
God, please don't let it happen.

282
00:24:43,526 --> 00:24:44,824
Go to sleep.

283
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:56,856
God, please,

284
00:25:57,025 --> 00:25:59,186
don't let it show.

285
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,830
I'll never miss mass again.

286
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:55,350
Midnight mass
was so short and sweet

287
00:28:55,528 --> 00:28:57,621
now that I'd become an atheist.

288
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:00,063
I'd kept my promise, though.

289
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,501
I'd never missed mass...
midnight mass.

290
00:29:03,672 --> 00:29:05,196
Once a year.

291
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:07,401
It made her happy.

292
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:10,102
It kept his mouth shut.

293
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:39,130
You dragging your trash around,
brother-in-law?

294
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,165
It's your present.

295
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:43,133
Well, if it isn't Zac!

296
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:45,206
What, no girlfriend yet?

297
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:56,553
Christmas 1975

298
00:30:58,324 --> 00:30:59,485
Nice paper.

299
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,489
Every year, I told them:

300
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:04,187
No christmas wrapping paper
for my birthday presents, okay?

301
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:06,060
That's not what matters.

302
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:13,608
After the drum set, accordion,
guitar and violin...

303
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:14,767
a banjo.

304
00:31:14,946 --> 00:31:17,414
You said to surprise you.

305
00:31:18,618 --> 00:31:21,953
It's so hard to know
what teenagers want nowadays.

306
00:31:22,123 --> 00:31:24,091
You try to please them...

307
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:58,736
Some fantasies
are worth keeping.

308
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:03,042
Merry christmas!
Happy New Year!

309
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,269
You know what time it is,
Raymond?

310
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:07,209
You're late.

311
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:09,914
I was starting to worry.

312
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:11,577
- Hi. I'm Doris.
- Good evening.

313
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:13,585
- Merry christmas.
- Take off your boots.

314
00:32:13,756 --> 00:32:15,088
- How are you?
- Hi, Dad.

315
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:17,091
- Merry christmas.
- Pleased to meet you.

316
00:32:17,262 --> 00:32:18,787
I'm Raymond's mother.

317
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:26,805
My family always
appreciated gourmet food.

318
00:32:30,613 --> 00:32:32,376
Did you at least make a wish?

319
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:35,212
It won't come true,
he can't get it up yet.

320
00:32:37,804 --> 00:32:40,138
My brothers
hadn't changed a bit.

321
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:42,241
Dad, Zac gave him the finger!

322
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:44,572
- Except my darling Yvan.
- Such brotherly love!

323
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:47,512
And how polite
they are in public.

324
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,652
Turn that music down.

325
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:07,339
Every christmas,

326
00:33:07,543 --> 00:33:09,408
the bastard barely stayed an hour.

327
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:11,879
Just long enough
to stuff himself...

328
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,677
and to piss me off.

329
00:33:27,903 --> 00:33:30,031
Here, buy whatever you want.

330
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:33,074
Happy birthday.

331
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:34,370
Wait.

332
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:00,712
I loved daydreaming
about my mother.

333
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:02,245
Picturing myself wealthy,

334
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,681
so that, one day,
I could spoil her.

335
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:08,790
Merry christmas!

336
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:14,330
It's beautiful. Thank you.

337
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:25,907
Oh, what a lovely dress.

338
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,915
My cousin Brigitte
had just dropped out of school

339
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:27,583
to devote herself
to social dancing full-time.

340
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:29,229
At the age of 15.

341
00:35:51,427 --> 00:35:53,794
I can dance too, you know!

342
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:58,058
But it's not my specialty.

343
00:35:58,236 --> 00:36:00,431
Back by popular request...

344
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:01,800
No getting around it.

345
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:18,595
It's your birthday!

346
00:36:19,732 --> 00:36:22,133
- You've really changed.
- Yeah, you too.

347
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:25,699
This is my boyfriend, Paul.

348
00:36:25,873 --> 00:36:27,501
My cousin, Zac.

349
00:36:29,878 --> 00:36:31,847
He has his driver's license!

350
00:36:34,218 --> 00:36:36,186
I'm stealing one.

351
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:51,903
- You don't smoke?
- Never touch the stuff.

352
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:55,567
Good thing. If it was up to him,
he'd be smoking nonstop.

353
00:36:55,745 --> 00:36:57,908
We go to the movies,
he wants to smoke;

354
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,914
we go skating,
he wants to smoke...

355
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:01,678
You skate? Roller-skate?

356
00:37:06,193 --> 00:37:10,858
The guys' turn, full blast,
music blaring, really stoned -

357
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:14,025
you let yourself go...
you can hear everything,

358
00:37:14,203 --> 00:37:17,538
and feel like everything around you
is moving in slow-motion,

359
00:37:17,707 --> 00:37:19,176
like in a movie.

360
00:37:22,548 --> 00:37:24,346
A stoner movie, yeah.

361
00:37:27,222 --> 00:37:28,711
Try it.

362
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:30,379
Give me a shotgun.

363
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,718
No way.

364
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:33,223
Are you nuts?

365
00:37:33,394 --> 00:37:35,524
I burned my tongue last time.

366
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:41,402
I thought of you
and it stopped burning.

367
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:43,566
He has a gift
for healing burns.

368
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:45,209
- What?
- And staunching blood.

369
00:37:46,747 --> 00:37:49,409
It's true! Tell him!

370
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:53,077
My mother got that
into the whole family's head.

371
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:56,554
You stop your girlfriend's
monthly bleeding, too?

372
00:37:58,261 --> 00:37:59,592
Idiot.

373
00:37:59,762 --> 00:38:01,857
That's it, make a fool of me.

374
00:38:03,535 --> 00:38:05,663
I don't believe in that anymore.
Sorry.

375
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,874
That doesn't mean
you've lost your blessing.

376
00:38:11,044 --> 00:38:12,672
You blessed fool!

377
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:21,355
You want a shotgun?

378
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,250
Boy, have you changed!

379
00:39:06,118 --> 00:39:08,451
Well, well...
if it isn't the lovely Michelle.

380
00:39:08,623 --> 00:39:10,250
- Hi, Mr. Beaulieu.
- Hi.

381
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,057
I'll finish up later.

382
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:16,561
No problem.

383
00:39:25,611 --> 00:39:28,446
- Is she really on the pill?
- Enough about my cousin.

384
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,108
I'm not the one
who wants to sleep with her.

385
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,346
That's the last time
I confide in you.

386
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:36,253
Why are the prettiest girls
always the dumbest?

387
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:39,421
You've never seen her.

388
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,428
I've seen her picture.
Enough said.

389
00:39:44,636 --> 00:39:46,104
Don't be jealous.

390
00:39:47,307 --> 00:39:48,774
You're dumb too.

391
00:39:54,316 --> 00:39:58,277
I see her once a year. How am
I supposed to sleep with her?

392
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:01,120
Anyway, she's got a boyfriend.

393
00:40:02,326 --> 00:40:05,124
Older. As dumb as she is.

394
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,137
Not as dumb as you?

395
00:40:15,511 --> 00:40:16,809
Don't.

396
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,319
It'll ruin our friendship.

397
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:28,653
That's not what you said
last week.

398
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:31,329
Stop it.

399
00:40:36,372 --> 00:40:37,838
See what happens?

400
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:41,003
Absolutely nothing!

401
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:03,469
Don't tell me he groped her.

402
00:43:07,472 --> 00:43:09,633
You done imitating
that fucking fag?

403
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:12,777
Huh?! You're making us
look like a bunch of idiots!

404
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:31,167
Get outta here!

405
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:37,540
It's my room too!

406
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,224
C'mon, Toto,
ask him for an autograph.

407
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:54,900
Got a problem?

408
00:43:56,936 --> 00:43:58,063
No.

409
00:44:09,555 --> 00:44:12,491
Having a crazy brother
also had its advantages.

410
00:44:12,658 --> 00:44:16,060
- Always ready to help...
- Pay up, you little bastard.

411
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:18,198
... for the modest sum of $2.

412
00:44:52,145 --> 00:44:54,170
We were here first.

413
00:44:54,347 --> 00:44:55,872
Shut up, faggot.

414
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,945
What did you call him?

415
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,286
Apologize.

416
00:45:08,465 --> 00:45:11,765
Apologize
and switch back to his show.

417
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:24,680
Apologize, I said!!!

418
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,617
It's okay, Dad.

419
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:37,760
Go on!!

420
00:45:43,078 --> 00:45:45,013
Sorry.

421
00:45:55,093 --> 00:45:56,562
What's for dinner?

422
00:45:59,266 --> 00:46:00,598
What happened to you?

423
00:46:00,702 --> 00:46:03,068
Just a hockey fight.

424
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:06,539
- Didn't you have practice today?
- Yeah, yeah.

425
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:07,769
You fought with a teammate?

426
00:46:07,911 --> 00:46:11,211
It was just a scuffle.
Didn't even drop my gloves.

427
00:46:11,383 --> 00:46:13,908
- Who with?
- Tremblay.

428
00:46:15,288 --> 00:46:17,381
You got beaten up
by Tremblay's little fag?

429
00:46:17,557 --> 00:46:19,026
What, you four-eyed fag?

430
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:24,098
What's with you always
calling each other fags?

431
00:46:24,965 --> 00:46:27,765
You'd swear we're nothing
but a bunch of fairies!

432
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:50,793
Please...

433
00:46:52,837 --> 00:46:54,635
anything but that.

434
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:09,087
Sorry about last night.

435
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,626
You know I don't like you talking
to your brother that way.

436
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,097
Yeah...

437
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:23,474
Okay, see you at work.

438
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:25,245
Careful, now.

439
00:48:16,883 --> 00:48:19,316
Please let me bump into them.

440
00:48:33,571 --> 00:48:35,232
What're you doing here?

441
00:48:37,142 --> 00:48:40,806
- Just in the neighbourhood.
- God, you've changed.

442
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,471
What'd you do to your hair?

443
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:43,810
It's cool.

444
00:48:43,984 --> 00:48:45,282
Thanks.

445
00:48:46,321 --> 00:48:49,155
You alone?
- No, I'm with...

446
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:51,452
my new dance partner.

447
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,466
He's Italian.

448
00:48:59,672 --> 00:49:01,070
Thank you.

449
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,432
This is my cousin, Zac.

450
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:16,287
Okay, well...

451
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:18,520
I'll be off.

452
00:49:59,652 --> 00:50:01,244
Change... change...

453
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,949
I would be cured of my asthma...

454
00:50:05,126 --> 00:50:07,458
if I only managed to get through.

455
00:50:21,314 --> 00:50:23,305
For the second time of my life...

456
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:30,858
I was declared clinically dead...

457
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,057
for three seconds.

458
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:16,946
Thank God you were dedicated
to Virgin Mary.

459
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,319
I can't believe it.

460
00:51:22,494 --> 00:51:23,962
It's a miracle.

461
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,126
You know you made your father cry?

462
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:33,472
Don't ever scare us
like that again.

463
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:41,645
Feel like talking?

464
00:51:46,694 --> 00:51:48,161
I'll come back later.

465
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:53,098
While my mother performed
charitable works daily...

466
00:51:53,269 --> 00:51:58,140
her Baby Jesus
had only one thing on his mind.

467
00:53:27,192 --> 00:53:28,660
You asshole!

468
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:36,665
What're you doing?!

469
00:53:43,715 --> 00:53:45,183
Fucking liar.

470
00:54:20,564 --> 00:54:22,556
The hottest was a black chick.

471
00:54:22,734 --> 00:54:24,725
It was like
she'd never eaten before.

472
00:54:24,903 --> 00:54:28,739
Mind you, they smoked a couple
of joints. Makes you hungry.

473
00:54:28,908 --> 00:54:30,878
She sucked him like a Hoover!

474
00:54:31,245 --> 00:54:33,578
He held her head,
thrusting as deep as he could.

475
00:54:33,749 --> 00:54:35,717
The harder she sucked,
the more he screamed.

476
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:38,180
The more he screamed,
the harder she sucked.

477
00:54:51,637 --> 00:54:53,607
Ever had a blow job?

478
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,650
What do you want?

479
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:27,248
I was wondering
where my shades went.

480
00:55:28,955 --> 00:55:30,422
Going somewhere?

481
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:36,089
Boy, is this gonna cost me!

482
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:39,101
I didn't ask for nothing.

483
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:44,433
Your neck still sore?

484
00:55:48,147 --> 00:55:50,309
We're out of HP Sauce.

485
00:55:50,484 --> 00:55:53,147
You get a 2-for-1 special today.

486
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:54,811
You'll learn to drive properly

487
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:58,117
and how to make your father's
world-class spaghetti sauce.

488
00:55:58,393 --> 00:56:00,590
Let's go,
before your mother catches us.

489
00:56:02,498 --> 00:56:05,628
Go ahead. Turn the key,
put it on "D."

490
00:56:07,505 --> 00:56:09,337
Good. Slowly, now.
Go ahead.

491
00:56:09,508 --> 00:56:11,671
- HP Sauce?
- That's my secret.

492
00:56:11,845 --> 00:56:13,676
Watch where you're going
and shut up.

493
00:56:13,847 --> 00:56:16,477
Lesson number one:
Shut up and drive.

494
00:56:18,354 --> 00:56:19,822
Go ahead.

495
00:56:20,691 --> 00:56:23,388
Slow down!
What are you, nuts?

496
00:56:37,044 --> 00:56:38,479
What are you doing?

497
00:56:38,648 --> 00:56:41,115
The school principal just called.

498
00:56:41,283 --> 00:56:43,878
Seems your son's been spreading
rumours about Raymond!

499
00:56:44,053 --> 00:56:46,286
I won't stand for smut around here!

500
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:48,448
Much less drugs!

501
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:49,615
What?

502
00:56:51,029 --> 00:56:53,829
If I have to call the police
to make Raymond understand,

503
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:55,866
I'll do it this time!

504
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,039
What's all this about?

505
00:57:01,044 --> 00:57:02,376
Huh?!

506
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:04,612
What's this?

507
00:57:04,783 --> 00:57:06,579
His little brothers live here!

508
00:57:37,325 --> 00:57:39,088
Stay away from me, I said!

509
00:57:42,999 --> 00:57:44,627
I didn't rat him out.

510
00:58:15,476 --> 00:58:18,378
He's already gone.
I didn't even say goodbye.

511
00:58:18,547 --> 00:58:21,039
Could be the wrong time,
but can I have his room?

512
00:58:21,218 --> 00:58:24,711
- I want it!
- No one's taking his room.

513
00:58:24,889 --> 00:58:26,355
Especially not you.

514
00:59:00,601 --> 00:59:03,037
Does this mean
we're not just friends anymore?

515
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,176
I dunno.

516
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,340
What do you think?

517
00:59:25,467 --> 00:59:27,369
What's he doing here?

518
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:32,742
Toto the Weirdo.

519
00:59:32,912 --> 00:59:34,436
Forget him.

520
00:59:40,021 --> 00:59:41,489
Peeping Tom.

521
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:44,626
What're you looking at?!

522
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:51,461
Fucker.

523
01:00:15,101 --> 01:00:18,594
She's so excited.
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

524
01:00:18,772 --> 01:00:22,972
She went on and on about Brigitte.
We'll never hear the end of it.

525
01:00:23,145 --> 01:00:26,115
Seems she's putting together
a big show with her boyfriend

526
01:00:26,283 --> 01:00:27,614
this christmas Eve.

527
01:00:27,784 --> 01:00:30,447
- With the Italian?
- No, she's back with the other.

528
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:32,454
The mambo dancer?

529
01:00:32,624 --> 01:00:34,455
He missed her big knockers.

530
01:00:34,626 --> 01:00:37,595
Who's the pig
who ate all my lard spread?

531
01:00:41,635 --> 01:00:44,435
Think of your little cousin Daniel;
he burned himself.

532
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:47,943
Too bad!

533
01:00:54,654 --> 01:00:57,317
Rutting teenager
in his natural habitat.

534
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,958
Shut up!

535
01:01:00,895 --> 01:01:02,386
What teenager?

536
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:22,081
You didn't come
just for my Tupperware?

537
01:01:29,532 --> 01:01:32,058
How are you coping
with your gift?

538
01:01:47,724 --> 01:01:49,191
Beautiful story.

539
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,394
A man dreamed he was walking
with christ on the beach

540
01:01:54,564 --> 01:01:57,034
while watching scenes of his life
flash across the sky.

541
01:01:58,905 --> 01:02:00,567
Upon turning around,

542
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:03,176
he noticed that
throughout most of his life,

543
01:02:03,378 --> 01:02:06,006
there were two sets
of footprints in the sand,

544
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:08,309
his and those of christ.

545
01:02:10,755 --> 01:02:13,019
Except during the worst times
of his life,

546
01:02:13,191 --> 01:02:16,183
when there was only one set
of prints.

547
01:02:18,097 --> 01:02:20,089
The man said to Jesus,

548
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:23,430
"You promised
you would walk with me always.

549
01:02:23,603 --> 01:02:26,903
Why did you forsake me
when I needed you most?"

550
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,742
Jesus replied...

551
01:02:32,617 --> 01:02:36,281
"There was only one set
of footprints in the sand

552
01:02:36,456 --> 01:02:40,292
during the worst times
of your life,

553
01:02:40,462 --> 01:02:42,429
because I carried you."

554
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:00,744
I want to be like everyone else.

555
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,190
Thank God, you never will.

556
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,887
What got into you?!

557
01:04:31,013 --> 01:04:33,141
You have to learn
to control yourself!

558
01:04:36,521 --> 01:04:38,991
I'm not going to the christmas
party this year.

559
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:46,566
The guy was twice his size.

560
01:04:47,937 --> 01:04:49,905
The little bastard's got nerve.

561
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,068
He gets that from his old man.

562
01:04:55,112 --> 01:04:57,104
He's been doing well lately, huh?

563
01:04:57,282 --> 01:04:59,114
You call that doing well?

564
01:04:59,286 --> 01:05:01,447
A little fight's no big deal.

565
01:05:06,227 --> 01:05:09,686
We should get him something special
this year, don't you think?

566
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:15,231
He just needed a girlfriend.

567
01:05:15,406 --> 01:05:17,203
Michelle's a nice girl.

568
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:21,539
He said she invited him over
for christmas Eve.

569
01:05:25,252 --> 01:05:26,915
He'll be 16.

570
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,422
We can start
cutting him a little slack.

571
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:31,220
You didn't agree?

572
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:35,228
I said we'd discuss it.

573
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:40,097
She can join us, if she wants
to spend christmas with him.

574
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:42,571
She can't take him away from us
on his birthday.

575
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:48,275
He can do whatever he wants
when he's older.

576
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,577
In the meantime, we celebrate
christmas as a family.

577
01:05:59,131 --> 01:06:01,464
What about a new stereo
for his room?

578
01:06:05,238 --> 01:06:07,537
I can't believe
what a good ear he has.

579
01:06:09,077 --> 01:06:11,046
He gets that from me, too.

580
01:07:13,897 --> 01:07:16,867
- I didn't do anything.
- Don't take me for an idiot!

581
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:19,897
What you did was wrong!

582
01:07:21,072 --> 01:07:22,539
I didn't do anything.

583
01:07:23,577 --> 01:07:25,568
- A liar, too!
- Let him explain.

584
01:07:25,746 --> 01:07:29,410
See what that pram business
and your mollycoddling does?

585
01:07:29,584 --> 01:07:32,748
He's never to set foot here again!
Is that clear?!

586
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:36,085
If you can't choose the right
friends, we'll do it for you.

587
01:07:36,259 --> 01:07:37,921
Fucking little faggot.

588
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:40,256
And you, you sap,
get dragged into it!

589
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:42,593
- Let him speak!
- Stop defending him!

590
01:07:42,768 --> 01:07:44,759
I know what I saw!

591
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,702
What you did was wrong.
You don't do this.

592
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:51,913
We went in to warm up, that's all.

593
01:07:56,286 --> 01:07:57,914
Did we ever beat you?

594
01:08:02,128 --> 01:08:05,359
Do we have to start,
so you stop mocking us!

595
01:08:08,401 --> 01:08:09,869
I'm sorry.

596
01:08:14,075 --> 01:08:15,907
I don't understand.

597
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:18,046
After everything
we've done for him.

598
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:22,074
This shouldn't be happening to us.

599
01:08:22,252 --> 01:08:25,884
It can happen to anyone.
It's no one's fault.

600
01:08:27,596 --> 01:08:30,565
Father carbonneau says
we mustn't seek to lay blame.

601
01:08:31,934 --> 01:08:33,765
Father carbonneau?

602
01:08:33,936 --> 01:08:35,905
I had to talk to someone.

603
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:39,910
- What am I, chopped liver?
- You're impossible to talk to.

604
01:08:44,182 --> 01:08:47,620
- The whole neighbourhood will know.
- Of course not.

605
01:08:47,788 --> 01:08:50,121
No one else is to know about this.
Is that clear?

606
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:52,418
This is strictly a family matter.

607
01:09:01,606 --> 01:09:03,437
What did the priest
have to say?

608
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:07,570
It's a sin, yes, but not the end
of the world. He's not alone.

609
01:09:07,748 --> 01:09:10,217
The sin is in the act,
not the inclination.

610
01:09:11,418 --> 01:09:13,081
Look who's talking.

611
01:09:13,256 --> 01:09:15,885
Him and his cassock!

612
01:09:17,427 --> 01:09:18,416
Don't start.

613
01:09:18,595 --> 01:09:21,430
He says he knows a priest
who's real good with teenagers.

614
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,433
Forget it.
It's not a priest he needs.

615
01:09:24,603 --> 01:09:27,368
Sometimes I wonder
why we pray to a long-haired guy

616
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:30,101
who hangs out with a bunch of guys
in robes.

617
01:09:30,277 --> 01:09:31,905
- It's fishy.
- Honestly!

618
01:09:32,948 --> 01:09:35,917
Why are there
no female priests, then?

619
01:09:37,954 --> 01:09:39,923
They're starting
to get on my nerves.

620
01:09:43,462 --> 01:09:46,489
Anyway, we'll take care
of his problem immediately.

621
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:48,601
It's all in his head.

622
01:09:51,072 --> 01:09:52,869
Abnormal people get treated.

623
01:09:55,911 --> 01:09:58,904
People aren't born that way,
they become so.

624
01:09:59,082 --> 01:10:01,917
It's up to us to make sure
that our son doesn't.

625
01:10:02,087 --> 01:10:03,952
Nature doesn't make mistakes.
There's no in-between.

626
01:10:04,122 --> 01:10:06,557
It's one or the other -
a boy or a girl.

627
01:10:08,094 --> 01:10:10,393
I'm willing to pay for a shrink
if necessary.

628
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:14,931
Our boy is a boy.

629
01:10:15,102 --> 01:10:17,095
No way I sired a fairy.

630
01:10:17,273 --> 01:10:20,072
We'll wipe any such notions
right out of his head!

631
01:10:24,451 --> 01:10:26,111
You have to be sick

632
01:10:26,285 --> 01:10:29,414
to spend your life sticking
your pecker up someone's ass!

633
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:35,256
You've got a short memory.

634
01:10:41,137 --> 01:10:42,604
That was different.

635
01:10:43,642 --> 01:10:45,633
And we only tried it once.

636
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,108
Once?

637
01:10:49,148 --> 01:10:51,117
Once or twice.
I don't remember.

638
01:10:51,986 --> 01:10:53,452
Well, I do.

639
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,433
I'm not seeing a shrink.
I'm warning you.

640
01:11:04,602 --> 01:11:06,867
I don't have a problem.
Understand?

641
01:11:12,446 --> 01:11:14,415
He does take after his father.

642
01:11:46,525 --> 01:11:48,994
He's freaking out over nothing.

643
01:11:49,162 --> 01:11:51,187
Nothing happened.

644
01:11:51,364 --> 01:11:53,162
We didn't touch each other.

645
01:11:54,335 --> 01:11:57,099
We jerked off in the same car,
no big deal.

646
01:11:59,942 --> 01:12:01,171
Why do it together,

647
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:02,438
then?

648
01:12:12,492 --> 01:12:13,926
Watching him excited you?

649
01:12:15,663 --> 01:12:17,291
I didn't watch him.

650
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:20,029
Do I look like a fag?

651
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:24,470
Do I talk with a lisp?
Strut like a peacock?

652
01:12:27,346 --> 01:12:29,644
Nice idea of homosexuals
you've got there.

653
01:12:29,815 --> 01:12:31,977
They're not all like that.

654
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:36,517
They all become that way.

655
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:38,158
Sooner or later.

656
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:44,001
This is a waste of time.
I'm not a fag.

657
01:12:47,372 --> 01:12:49,340
I'd rather die.

658
01:12:56,884 --> 01:12:58,751
It's just a figure of speech.

659
01:13:00,223 --> 01:13:01,622
Isn't it obvious?

660
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,629
Being happy and healthy,
or miserable and fucked-up?

661
01:13:05,863 --> 01:13:07,525
It's a no-brainer.

662
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:14,235
So?

663
01:13:15,776 --> 01:13:17,745
A subconsciously deliberate
mistake.

664
01:13:19,781 --> 01:13:20,908
What?

665
01:13:22,786 --> 01:13:25,620
He says I deliberately did that
in your car so you'd catch me,

666
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:27,621
find out I was gay

667
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:30,591
and accept it so that I could.

668
01:13:42,812 --> 01:13:45,441
Twenty-five bucks
for that hogwash?

669
01:13:47,653 --> 01:13:49,643
You didn't buy it, I hope?

670
01:13:49,821 --> 01:13:51,984
- 'Course not.
- Unbelievable.

671
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:54,649
"A subconsciously deliberate
mistake"!

672
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:57,663
He'll deliberately reimburse me,
believe me!

673
01:13:58,332 --> 01:14:00,300
What do you want?!

674
01:14:08,112 --> 01:14:10,411
You want to take this in to him?

675
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,784
He'll be glad to see you.

676
01:14:14,955 --> 01:14:17,253
I'm sure he's forgiven you.

677
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:32,536
Dad!

678
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:34,270
How are you?

679
01:14:34,447 --> 01:14:35,641
Come in, come in.

680
01:14:35,815 --> 01:14:37,647
What're you doing?
Get out of here.

681
01:14:37,818 --> 01:14:39,480
I don't have time.

682
01:14:39,654 --> 01:14:42,624
Your brother's waiting in the car.
I'll take a rain check.

683
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,159
Hey, bro.

684
01:14:50,334 --> 01:14:51,769
How you doing?

685
01:14:52,171 --> 01:14:54,800
So, you take my room,
you little bastard?

686
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:57,010
Oh, Dad, I almost forgot.

687
01:14:57,778 --> 01:14:59,576
Can you lend me a few bucks?

688
01:14:59,715 --> 01:15:02,445
I couldn't cash my cheque.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

689
01:15:14,768 --> 01:15:16,200
Better than nothing.

690
01:15:16,369 --> 01:15:17,734
See you.

691
01:17:12,991 --> 01:17:15,154
I would be cured

692
01:17:15,328 --> 01:17:18,296
if I could simply make it
through the storm.

693
01:18:31,362 --> 01:18:32,454
Happy birthday.

694
01:18:32,664 --> 01:18:35,098
Christmas 1980

695
01:18:35,267 --> 01:18:38,236
Fall on your knees

696
01:18:41,274 --> 01:18:44,268
O hear the angel voices

697
01:18:46,516 --> 01:18:49,110
O night divine

698
01:18:49,286 --> 01:18:52,120
The night...

699
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:54,919
When Christ was born

700
01:19:16,754 --> 01:19:20,089
Yesterday when I was young

701
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:23,253
The taste of life was sweet
as rain upon my tongue

702
01:19:23,432 --> 01:19:26,958
I teased at life
as if it were a foolish game

703
01:19:27,134 --> 01:19:31,505
The way the evening breeze
may tease a candle flame

704
01:19:31,674 --> 01:19:34,439
The thousand dreams I dreamed
the splendid things I planned

705
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:38,173
I always built alas
on weak and shifting sand

706
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:41,947
I lived by night and shunned
the naked light of the day

707
01:19:42,122 --> 01:19:47,460
And only now I see how
the years ran away

708
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:54,194
So many drinking songs
were waiting to be sung

709
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:56,863
So many wayward pleasures
lay in store for me

710
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:59,442
And so much pain
my dazzled eyes refused to see

711
01:19:59,611 --> 01:20:01,547
I ran so fast that time
and youth at last ran out

712
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,342
He wrote that for you, Zac.

713
01:20:03,517 --> 01:20:05,850
Yesterday the moon was blue

714
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:10,219
And every crazy day brought
something new to do

715
01:20:10,393 --> 01:20:13,125
I used my magic age
as if it were a wand

716
01:20:13,297 --> 01:20:16,790
And never saw the waste
and emptiness beyond

717
01:20:16,968 --> 01:20:21,235
The game of love I played
with arrogance and pride

718
01:20:21,407 --> 01:20:25,242
And every flame I lit
too quickly quickly died

719
01:20:25,412 --> 01:20:28,872
The friends I made all
seemed somehow to drift away

720
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:32,885
And only I am left on stage
to end the play

721
01:20:33,055 --> 01:20:36,390
There are so many songs
in me that won't be sung

722
01:20:36,561 --> 01:20:40,556
I feel the bitter taste of tears
upon my tongue

723
01:20:40,734 --> 01:20:45,331
The time has come for me
to pay for yesterday

724
01:20:45,506 --> 01:20:51,878
When I was young

725
01:20:58,825 --> 01:21:00,417
Happy birthday, my man!

726
01:21:00,693 --> 01:21:03,288
The old man's still got it, huh?

727
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:13,003
It's been a while since
I've seen him with an inhaler.

728
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:16,544
He got rid of it.

729
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,383
Since when?

730
01:21:20,453 --> 01:21:23,047
- Almost a year, I think.
- He didn't tell us?

731
01:21:24,425 --> 01:21:26,655
I said nothing, okay?

732
01:21:34,604 --> 01:21:36,573
I don't know about cake.

733
01:21:37,608 --> 01:21:39,098
I overate.

734
01:21:39,276 --> 01:21:40,939
We've got news.

735
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:44,446
I don't want to steal your thunder,
bro, so I'll be quick.

736
01:21:44,617 --> 01:21:46,085
We're getting married.

737
01:21:49,957 --> 01:21:52,688
You hear that?!
They're getting married!

738
01:21:54,564 --> 01:21:55,793
I'm very happy!

739
01:21:55,966 --> 01:21:57,957
This calls for another bottle!

740
01:21:59,537 --> 01:22:00,562
Congratulations.

741
01:22:03,075 --> 01:22:05,043
How about a double wedding, honey?

742
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:07,180
Sit down and shut up.

743
01:22:07,347 --> 01:22:09,212
You look like a damn fool.

744
01:22:21,601 --> 01:22:22,964
What's the matter?

745
01:22:25,438 --> 01:22:26,905
What's going on?

746
01:22:31,645 --> 01:22:33,204
Tell him to go to hell.

747
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,407
Shut up, fag.

748
01:22:35,652 --> 01:22:37,314
You shut up.

749
01:22:39,023 --> 01:22:42,358
You seem to be sniffing a lot
for someone in detox.

750
01:22:42,528 --> 01:22:44,087
Did I miss something?

751
01:22:44,297 --> 01:22:46,595
Two subjects had become taboo
at home:

752
01:22:46,766 --> 01:22:47,598
Me,

753
01:22:47,768 --> 01:22:49,894
and Raymond.
- Sucking cock's made you a prick?

754
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:51,471
That's enough!

755
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,200
Your ass must've been raw
after prison.

756
01:22:54,376 --> 01:23:00,409
He'd done a year for beating up
a junkie who tried to steal his coke.

757
01:23:01,386 --> 01:23:02,820
You'd have enjoyed that, huh?

758
01:23:02,989 --> 01:23:04,684
That's quite enough!

759
01:23:05,558 --> 01:23:06,548
It's christmas!

760
01:23:06,693 --> 01:23:08,354
Can't we eat in peace?!

761
01:23:17,173 --> 01:23:18,936
Idiots!

762
01:24:28,767 --> 01:24:30,100
How sweet life was

763
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:33,036
since I had become
so happy and fulfilled.

764
01:25:23,607 --> 01:25:24,904
Aw, Mom!

765
01:25:27,613 --> 01:25:29,080
Yeah, that's right.

766
01:25:30,616 --> 01:25:33,781
Don't call me back
to say she's stopped bleeding.

767
01:25:33,955 --> 01:25:35,787
She'll stop anyway,

768
01:25:35,958 --> 01:25:37,756
whether or not I think of her.

769
01:25:51,811 --> 01:25:53,804
If I truly had a gift,

770
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,474
by dint of being his instrument,

771
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:59,143
perhaps he would one day
answer my prayers.

772
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,767
Had I known,
I wouldn't have come today.

773
01:26:16,278 --> 01:26:18,268
I think...

774
01:26:18,446 --> 01:26:20,244
you won't come much anymore.

775
01:26:22,819 --> 01:26:24,685
He says it's just
for a couple of weeks.

776
01:26:24,855 --> 01:26:26,848
Just long enough
to get back on his feet.

777
01:26:27,026 --> 01:26:29,017
To run through our savings,
you mean.

778
01:26:29,195 --> 01:26:31,858
Anyway, he seems determined.
I've never seen him like that.

779
01:26:32,032 --> 01:26:35,491
I think, this time, he really wants
to clean up his act.

780
01:26:37,037 --> 01:26:40,008
Please, make an effort.
Your brother needs help.

781
01:26:41,211 --> 01:26:42,839
So Michelle's well, then?

782
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,212
Yeah.

783
01:26:45,383 --> 01:26:46,851
I brought your records back.

784
01:26:49,722 --> 01:26:52,521
- Coffee?
- It's okay, Mom, I'll do it.

785
01:26:55,229 --> 01:26:56,492
What's new?

786
01:26:56,665 --> 01:26:58,758
Not much.
Classes, work.

787
01:26:58,901 --> 01:27:01,335
So, were they a hit?

788
01:27:01,504 --> 01:27:03,802
Your brother's playing
my old records at his club.

789
01:27:03,975 --> 01:27:05,602
Can you believe it?

790
01:27:08,682 --> 01:27:10,809
If that's the nutcase,
I'm not here.

791
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:16,513
No, he's busy.
Can he call you back?

792
01:27:16,692 --> 01:27:17,784
That her?

793
01:27:22,867 --> 01:27:24,333
It was for Yvan.

794
01:27:28,873 --> 01:27:30,671
Is Doris the "nutcase"?

795
01:27:33,412 --> 01:27:36,008
She was nuts to put up with you
for six years, that's for sure!

796
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:51,061
I'm sorry, Mom.

797
01:27:52,771 --> 01:27:54,740
I'll be out of your hair soon.

798
01:27:56,778 --> 01:27:58,609
I missed...

799
01:27:58,813 --> 01:28:01,339
your delicious ironed toast.

800
01:28:05,056 --> 01:28:06,818
I love you, Mom.

801
01:28:14,234 --> 01:28:15,702
Any bacon left?

802
01:28:17,071 --> 01:28:18,732
Well, I'll be going.

803
01:28:18,906 --> 01:28:20,203
Already?

804
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:23,277
- Need a ride back?
- Never mind, Dad.

805
01:28:23,447 --> 01:28:24,607
I'll go.

806
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:26,947
Coming?

807
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:33,152
It's disco?

808
01:28:33,326 --> 01:28:34,658
Not just disco.

809
01:28:34,829 --> 01:28:36,490
I play a bit of everything.

810
01:28:36,664 --> 01:28:38,131
Anything unusual.

811
01:28:39,334 --> 01:28:42,826
I'll come see you at some point.
I'll make an exception.

812
01:28:43,005 --> 01:28:45,975
I don't drink anymore,
so I avoid bars.

813
01:28:48,345 --> 01:28:51,679
I don't drink, smoke
or swear anymore.

814
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:54,820
Fuck, I left my bag of weed
at the pub.

815
01:28:57,858 --> 01:28:59,827
You can drop me at the corner.

816
01:29:05,136 --> 01:29:06,228
Listen...

817
01:29:10,976 --> 01:29:13,775
I know I haven't always been
cool with you.

818
01:29:17,985 --> 01:29:19,452
I need money.

819
01:29:21,157 --> 01:29:25,151
I'll pay you back. I don't know
when, but I swear I will.

820
01:29:25,329 --> 01:29:26,818
You're asking me?

821
01:29:26,996 --> 01:29:30,489
The old man brags that his little
pet makes more than he does.

822
01:29:30,667 --> 01:29:32,329
If he's got a pet,
it sure isn't me.

823
01:29:32,504 --> 01:29:34,666
Don't be a prick, I'm in a jam.

824
01:29:34,841 --> 01:29:38,471
Even if I was a millionaire,
I wouldn't lend you a dime.

825
01:29:46,524 --> 01:29:50,656
Antoine and christian did.
Even Fatty spotted me 20.

826
01:29:52,532 --> 01:29:53,830
Come on!

827
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,430
Do I have to give you a blow job?

828
01:30:08,886 --> 01:30:10,683
That's it, go kill yourself.

829
01:30:40,095 --> 01:30:41,561
Aren't you in bed yet?

830
01:30:44,801 --> 01:30:45,790
Here.

831
01:30:45,933 --> 01:30:48,233
Someone left this for you tonight.

832
01:30:52,444 --> 01:30:53,740
G'night.

833
01:31:11,067 --> 01:31:14,232
You want to get things hopping,
give this tape to the DJ.

834
01:31:14,373 --> 01:31:17,673
- Do I have to wear this?
- I want this off, too.

835
01:31:17,844 --> 01:31:21,178
Bunch of nitwits. A tux
without a bow tie isn't a tux.

836
01:31:21,348 --> 01:31:23,839
We're all dressed the same.
That's the beauty of it. Huh?

837
01:31:24,018 --> 01:31:25,487
Very nice.

838
01:31:26,656 --> 01:31:28,147
Where have you been?

839
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,326
Fatty.

840
01:31:34,033 --> 01:31:36,332
- Goddammit, Raymond!
- I'll pay you back.

841
01:31:41,042 --> 01:31:42,304
Congratulations.

842
01:31:49,519 --> 01:31:51,010
Aren't you going to introduce us?

843
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:53,880
My mother.

844
01:31:54,059 --> 01:31:55,391
My brothers.

845
01:31:55,561 --> 01:31:57,324
My father. Min.

846
01:31:57,463 --> 01:31:58,897
What's that?

847
01:31:59,066 --> 01:32:00,364
Min.

848
01:32:36,048 --> 01:32:37,846
He takes after his old man!

849
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:16,032
Is that idiot gonna play my tape
or what?

850
01:33:32,122 --> 01:33:33,112
Not dancing?

851
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:35,452
I'm waiting for my song.

852
01:33:35,626 --> 01:33:37,596
By popular request...

853
01:33:43,737 --> 01:33:45,672
Shall we go smoke one outside?

854
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,274
Good idea.

855
01:33:48,811 --> 01:33:52,270
You two go ahead.
Michelle and I will have girl talk.

856
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:26,828
What is it?

857
01:34:34,337 --> 01:34:35,804
Your girlfriend's nice.

858
01:34:39,678 --> 01:34:41,145
She's cute, too.

859
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:47,750
You want a shotgun?

860
01:35:58,249 --> 01:35:59,409
A coke.

861
01:36:01,186 --> 01:36:02,380
Same.

862
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:08,823
I'm very proud of you.

863
01:36:15,873 --> 01:36:16,702
What's so funny?

864
01:36:24,017 --> 01:36:25,415
Check those two out.

865
01:36:25,584 --> 01:36:28,851
Little Zac sure seems
to like his cousin.

866
01:36:29,023 --> 01:36:31,254
Talk about keeping it
in the family!

867
01:36:31,427 --> 01:36:33,589
He's not after his cousin,
but her boyfriend.

868
01:36:33,763 --> 01:36:37,564
I saw them French-kissing
in the parking lot earlier.

869
01:36:38,936 --> 01:36:40,300
So it's true.

870
01:36:40,471 --> 01:36:42,566
Junior's a fag.

871
01:36:42,742 --> 01:36:44,232
Looks like it.

872
01:36:52,789 --> 01:36:54,187
Ah, damn.

873
01:37:33,508 --> 01:37:34,977
Don't touch me!

874
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:39,980
Are you okay?

875
01:37:48,694 --> 01:37:49,788
Keep dancing.

876
01:37:49,964 --> 01:37:52,364
Just a little misunderstanding.

877
01:37:52,535 --> 01:37:54,024
The wedding goes on.
Keep dancing.

878
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:55,533
No, everything's okay.

879
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:57,172
Keep dancing!

880
01:38:03,048 --> 01:38:04,106
Christian!

881
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:08,815
I'm sorry!

882
01:38:13,195 --> 01:38:14,527
What's going on?!

883
01:38:14,697 --> 01:38:15,995
Stop!

884
01:38:17,868 --> 01:38:19,665
Give us a minute?

885
01:38:25,211 --> 01:38:26,906
On your brother's wedding day!

886
01:38:28,548 --> 01:38:30,641
Raymond causes trouble
and I get in shit?

887
01:38:30,818 --> 01:38:33,013
What happened was your fault.
Your brother was defending you.

888
01:38:33,187 --> 01:38:35,679
You were being called a fag!

889
01:38:36,892 --> 01:38:39,864
They saw you in the parking lot
with your cousin's boyfriend!

890
01:38:41,566 --> 01:38:43,000
What did they see?

891
01:38:45,906 --> 01:38:48,033
It's not what you think.

892
01:38:51,412 --> 01:38:52,901
We were smoking a joint.

893
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:55,107
We just gave each other a shotgun.

894
01:38:57,921 --> 01:39:00,412
You're a born liar.

895
01:39:00,993 --> 01:39:02,721
Nothing happened!

896
01:39:02,861 --> 01:39:04,853
Be a man for once in your life

897
01:39:05,031 --> 01:39:07,090
and tell the truth!

898
01:39:08,368 --> 01:39:10,165
What do you want to hear?!

899
01:39:11,205 --> 01:39:12,695
That I'm gay?!

900
01:39:12,873 --> 01:39:14,033
A fag?!

901
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:15,733
That I suck cock?!

902
01:39:18,381 --> 01:39:20,544
Yes, something happened,
but not with him!

903
01:39:21,252 --> 01:39:22,617
You know with who.

904
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:27,423
Nothing happened earlier.

905
01:39:27,594 --> 01:39:30,428
But I would've fucking loved it
if something had!

906
01:39:32,066 --> 01:39:34,160
Fucking right!

907
01:39:40,576 --> 01:39:41,873
Go.

908
01:39:45,115 --> 01:39:47,017
Go.

909
01:39:48,587 --> 01:39:49,884
Go away!

910
01:41:26,484 --> 01:41:28,282
Forgive me, Mom.

911
01:41:28,454 --> 01:41:30,446
I know you'll be sad I'm gone.

912
01:41:30,623 --> 01:41:33,491
But I know you'll be glad
to know where I am.

913
01:41:33,661 --> 01:41:35,458
Don't worry.

914
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:37,791
Your God is watching over me.

915
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:40,799
Raymond made me realize something
the other day:

916
01:41:40,969 --> 01:41:43,063
I've never told you I love you.

917
01:41:55,256 --> 01:41:57,657
This side trip to the Holy Land,
before Europe,

918
01:41:57,826 --> 01:41:59,454
would make her ecstatic.

919
01:42:03,301 --> 01:42:06,065
Walking in christ's footsteps
certainly intrigued me...

920
01:42:08,439 --> 01:42:10,932
but I hadn't crossed the Atlantic

921
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:13,078
out of catholic faith.

922
01:45:12,818 --> 01:45:14,616
Zac, are you there?

923
01:45:18,993 --> 01:45:20,460
I love you, sweetheart!

924
01:49:54,959 --> 01:49:58,259
God works in mysterious ways,
my mother always said.

925
01:50:47,428 --> 01:50:50,363
The good Lord brought you back.
It's a sign.

926
01:50:53,902 --> 01:50:55,700
You'll heal him.

927
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:22,206
Thanks for coming, christian.

928
01:51:33,924 --> 01:51:35,893
I'm so happy you're staying.

929
01:51:39,097 --> 01:51:40,895
I want to know everything.

930
01:51:43,936 --> 01:51:45,301
Dad coming down?

931
01:51:47,274 --> 01:51:48,742
He's in bed already.

932
01:51:49,943 --> 01:51:51,741
- Good night.
- Good night.

933
01:52:02,727 --> 01:52:04,719
I found him lying there,

934
01:52:04,897 --> 01:52:06,866
with a syringe in his arm.

935
01:52:19,116 --> 01:52:22,450
I think it'll be a while
before I get that 20 back.

936
01:52:25,291 --> 01:52:26,258
What?

937
01:52:27,794 --> 01:52:30,093
You lost that 20 long ago.

938
01:52:33,636 --> 01:52:35,933
If you ask me,
it was no accident.

939
01:53:55,510 --> 01:53:57,978
He'll pull through.
He's tough.

940
01:54:04,457 --> 01:54:06,425
I know I'm not a perfect father.

941
01:54:08,295 --> 01:54:11,595
You certainly wouldn't have
the problems you do otherwise.

942
01:54:12,467 --> 01:54:14,094
Raymond, either.

943
01:54:15,804 --> 01:54:18,638
I'm trying to understand
what's happening to us now...

944
01:54:18,808 --> 01:54:20,275
It's not easy.

945
01:54:25,651 --> 01:54:28,118
I know I'm partly to blame.

946
01:54:31,992 --> 01:54:33,324
I'd like to redeem myself,

947
01:54:33,495 --> 01:54:35,292
but I don't know how.

948
01:54:38,001 --> 01:54:40,332
I don't know what to tell you...

949
01:54:40,503 --> 01:54:43,599
to make you understand
you're not what you think.

950
01:54:51,986 --> 01:54:55,285
You can't forsake
life's greatest pleasure -

951
01:54:56,659 --> 01:54:58,126
having children.

952
01:55:00,664 --> 01:55:02,825
There's nothing more beautiful...

953
01:55:02,966 --> 01:55:04,264
more powerful.

954
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:08,603
And that really hits home
when you come close...

955
01:55:08,773 --> 01:55:10,241
to losing one.

956
01:55:12,611 --> 01:55:13,738
Because...

957
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:18,247
there's no greater pain.

958
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:30,858
The good Lord must surely
be trying to tell me something.

959
01:55:38,814 --> 01:55:41,443
If you think it's a lost cause...

960
01:55:42,987 --> 01:55:45,012
that you can't change...

961
01:55:51,464 --> 01:55:53,763
I can't accept that.

962
01:55:55,802 --> 01:55:57,203
I can't.

963
01:57:34,635 --> 01:57:36,261
I'm sorry.

964
01:58:23,699 --> 01:58:24,997
Speaking.

965
01:58:29,039 --> 01:58:30,700
Oh, my God.

966
01:58:30,875 --> 01:58:32,172
Oh, no.

967
01:58:45,729 --> 01:58:48,130
Even in the face of death,
we have faith that life goes on,

968
01:58:48,233 --> 01:58:49,564
for it comes from God.

969
01:58:49,735 --> 01:58:52,862
It is to him
that we now turn in prayer.

970
01:58:56,175 --> 01:58:57,837
Our Father

971
01:58:58,011 --> 01:58:59,342
Who art in heaven

972
01:58:59,513 --> 01:59:00,845
Hallowed be thy name

973
01:59:01,016 --> 01:59:02,642
Thy kingdom come

974
01:59:02,817 --> 01:59:05,583
They will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

975
01:59:05,755 --> 01:59:07,222
Give us this day

976
01:59:07,389 --> 01:59:08,756
Our daily bread

977
01:59:08,926 --> 01:59:10,257
And forgive us our trespasses

978
01:59:10,428 --> 01:59:12,455
As we forgive those
who trespass against us

979
01:59:12,632 --> 01:59:15,932
And lead us not into temptation

980
01:59:16,104 --> 01:59:17,798
But deliver us from evil

981
01:59:48,211 --> 01:59:49,735
You spoke well.

982
01:59:50,782 --> 01:59:53,080
I was deeply... touched.

983
02:00:28,165 --> 02:00:29,463
Ciao, bro.

984
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:36,469
See ya, kid.

985
02:00:39,011 --> 02:00:40,001
Mr. Beaulieu...

986
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:42,149
You'll come visit us, hmm?

987
02:01:09,119 --> 02:01:10,451
Bye, Dad.

988
02:01:10,621 --> 02:01:12,748
Take care of yourself.
Mom, too.

989
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:09,905
I don't know if it was Raymond's
passing, or if time heals all wounds,

990
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:13,743
but my father had become
my father once more.

991
02:03:13,919 --> 02:03:16,113
Although it took him 10 years

992
02:03:16,287 --> 02:03:18,086
to allow me into his home
with a lover.

993
02:03:18,257 --> 02:03:20,097
And we've never mentioned
our differences since.

994
02:03:21,724 --> 02:03:24,537
Nor Patsy cline.

995
02:04:21,724 --> 02:04:24,537
