They got him behind the lines,
and we never heard of him since.

they couldn't see it that way.

Not Kat! If he were out,
the war would be over.

- He's out lookin' for food,
something to make soup with.

- Which way?
- Down the road about two miles that way.

- Oh, it's all right now. It's fine.

- No, the general's staff's been
over this country with a rake.

how was it at home?

- What's the matter?

Ohh... I'm no good
for back there any more, Kat.

None of us are.
We've been in this too long.

a coward because I told them that...

At least we know what it's all about
out here. There're no lies here.

You ought to see what they've got
on the other side.

1349

They eat white bread
over there.

1350
02:02:14,167 --> 02:02:16,442
They've got dozens of aeroplanes
to our one...

1351
02:02:16,527 --> 02:02:19,599
and tanks that'll
go over anything.

no officers.

better be going.

to my poor mother.

1359
02:02:47,727 --> 02:02:51,925
I told her it wasn't so bad
out here because there was
always a lot of us together.

1360
02:02:53,567 --> 02:02:56,684
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning
to believe that I told her the truth.

the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?

Aah, I think
it broke my shin.
