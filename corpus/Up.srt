{1104}{1255}Movietown News presents|Spotlight on Adventure.
{1256}{1282}What you are now witnessing
{1283}{1345}is footage never before seen|by civilized humanity,
{1346}{1389}a lost world in South America.
{1390}{1445}Lurking in the shadow|of majestic Paradise Falls,
{1446}{1525}it sports plants and animals|undiscovered by science.
{1526}{1605}Who would dare set foot|on this inhospitable summit?
{1606}{1703}Why, our subject today,|Charles Muntz!
{1704}{1769}The beloved explorer lands|his dirigible the Spirit of Adventure,
{1770}{1805}in New Hampshire this week,
{1806}{1891}completing a yearlong expedition|to the lost world.
{1892}{1953}This lighter-than-air craft|was designed by Muntz himself
{1954}{2057}and is longer than 22 prohibition|paddy wagons placed end to end.
{2058}{2126}And here comes the adventurer now.
{2127}{2170}Never apart from his faithful dogs,
{2171}{2229}Muntz conceived the craft|for canine comfort.
{2230}{2279}It's a veritable floating palace|in the sky,
{2280}{2381}complete with doggy bath|and mechanical canine walker.
{2382}{2467}And, Jiminy Cricket do the locals|consider Muntz the bee's knees.
{2468}{2509}And how!
{2510}{2613}Adventure is out there!
{2614}{2673}But what|has Muntz brought back this time?
{2674}{2823}Gentlemen, I give you|the monster of Paradise Falls!
{2824}{2917}And, golly, what a|swell monster this is!
{2918}{2975}But what's this? Scientists cry foul.
{2976}{3029}The National Explorer's Society|accuses Muntz
{3030}{3073}of fabricating the skeleton.
{3074}{3109}No!
{3110}{3146}The organization strips Muntz
{3147}{3238}of his membership.
{3244}{3313}Humiliated,|Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls
{3314}{3385}and promises|to capture the beast alive!
{3386}{3475}I promise to capture the beast alive,
{3476}{3577}and I will not come back until I do!
{3578}{3641}And so,|the explorer's off to clear his name.
{3642}{3682}Bon voyage, Charles Muntz,
{3683}{3860}and good luck capturing|the monster of Paradise Falls!
{3958}{3989}Here's Charles Muntz
{3990}{4110}piloting his famous dirigible.
{4142}{4219}He hurdles Pikes Peak.
{4220}{4299}He hurdles the Grand Canyon.
{4300}{4407}He hurdles Mount Everest.
{4408}{4489}He goes around Mount Everest.
{4490}{4601}Is there nothing he cannot do?
{4602}{4650}Yes, as Muntz himself says,|"Adventure is..."
{4651}{4737}Adventure is out there!|Look out!
{4738}{4811}Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard!
{4812}{4903}Must get Spirit of Adventure|over Mount Rushmore!
{4904}{5057}Hold together, old girl.|How're my dogs doing?
{5058}{5187}All engines, ahead full!|Let's take her up to 26,000 feet.
{5188}{5253}Rudders 18 degrees towards the south.
{5254}{5345}It's a beautiful day.|Winds out of the east at 10 knots.
{5346}{5470}Visibility unlimited.|Enter the weather in the logbook.
{5471}{5561}Oh! There's something down there.|I will bring it back for science.
{5562}{5722}Aw! It's a puppy! Ah! No time!|A storm! Lightning. Hail.
{5723}{5774}- What are you doing?|- Ahhh!
{5775}{5831}Don't you know|this is an exclusive club?
{5832}{5880}Only explorers get in here,
{5881}{5978}not just any kid off the street|with a helmet and a pair of goggles.
{5979}{6084}Do you think you've got what it takes?|Well, do you?
{6085}{6178}All right, you're in. Welcome aboard.
{6179}{6294}What's wrong? Can't you talk?
{6295}{6386}Hey, I don't bite.
{6445}{6570}You and me, we're in a club now.
{6608}{6730}I saw where your balloon went.|Come on. Let's go get it.
{6731}{6817}My name's Ellie.
{6849}{6926}There it is.
{6985}{7069}Well, go ahead.
{7145}{7207}Go on.
{7669}{7703}Ow.
{7704}{7765}Hey, kid!
{7766}{7809}Thought you might need|a little cheering up.
{7810}{7907}I got something to show you.
{7908}{7968}I am about to let you|see something
{7969}{8045}I have never shown|to another human being.
{8046}{8117}Ever! In my life!
{8118}{8226}You'll have to swear|you will not tell anyone.
{8227}{8332}Cross your heart. Do it!
{8343}{8434}My Adventure Book.
{8447}{8503}You know him.
{8504}{8566}Charles Muntz, explorer.
{8567}{8660}When I get big,|I'm going where he's going,
{8661}{8796}South America.|It's like America, but south.
{8797}{8853}Wanna know where I'm gonna live?
{8854}{8987}"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."
{8988}{9092}I ripped this right|out of a library book.
{9093}{9190}I'm gonna move my clubhouse there|and park it right next to the falls.
{9191}{9257}Who knows what lives up there.
{9258}{9297}And once I get there?
{9298}{9420}Well, I'm saving these pages for|all the adventures I'm gonna have.
{9421}{9610}Only I just don't know|how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls.
{9704}{9784}That's it!|You can take us there in a blimp!
{9785}{9854}Swear you'll take us! Cross your heart!
{9855}{9990}Cross it! Cross your heart!|Good, you promised. No backing out.
{9991}{10088}Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!
{10089}{10190}Adventure is out there!
{10191}{10263}You know, you don't talk very much.
{10264}{10338}I like you!
{10358}{10416}Wow.
{17274}{17332}Hah!
{19623}{19709}Stevie, throw me a deuce!
{19710}{19820}Quite a sight, huh, Ellie?
{19854}{19940}Uh! Mail's here.
{20219}{20351}Shady Oaks Retirement.|Oh, brother.
{20373}{20435}Hmm...
{20542}{20629}Hey! Morning, Mr. Fredricksen.|Need any help there?
{20630}{20674}No. Yes!
{20675}{20769}Tell your boss over there|that you boys are ruining our house.
{20770}{20808}Well, just to let you know,
{20809}{20872}my boss will be happy to take|this old place off your hands,
{20873}{20934}and for double his last offer!
{20935}{21029}What do you say to that?
{21030}{21073}Uh, I take that as a "no," then?
{21074}{21158}I believe I made my position|to your boss quite clear.
{21159}{21218}You poured prune juice in his gas tank.
{21219}{21368}Yeah, that was good.|Here, let me talk to him.
{21369}{21500}You in the suit.|Yes, you. Take a bath, hippie!
{21501}{21546}I am not with him!
{21547}{21638}This is serious!|He's out to get your house.
{21639}{21710}Tell your boss|he can have our house.
{21711}{21808}- Really?|- When I'm dead!
{21809}{21870}I'll take that as a maybe.
{21871}{21912}ANNOUNCER ON TV> Order now,|you get the camera,
{21913}{21990}you get the printer, 4x optical zoom,
{21991}{22132}Schneider lens, photo printer, SD card.
{22171}{22248}"Good afternoon. My name is Russell.
{22249}{22378}"And I am a Wilderness Explorer|in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12.
{22379}{22446}"Are you in need|of any assistance today, sir?"
{22447}{22473}No.
{22474}{22554}- I could help you cross the street.|- No.
{22555}{22649}- I could help you cross your yard.|- No.
{22650}{22745}- I could help you cross your porch.|- No.
{22746}{22797}Well, I gotta help you cross something.
{22798}{22892}No. I'm doing fine.
{23010}{23085}"Good afternoon. My name is Russell."
{23086}{23137}- Kid... Kid.|- "And I am a Wilderness Explorer
{23138}{23236}- "in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12."|- I... Slow down. Kid!
{23237}{23280}- "Are you in need of any assistance..."|- Thank you,
{23281}{23360}- but I don't need any help!|- "...today, sir?"
{23361}{23416}Ow.
{23490}{23538}Proceed.
{23539}{23634}- "Good afternoon..."|- But skip to the end!
{23635}{23732}See these? These are|my Wilderness Explorer badges.
{23733}{23854}You may notice one is missing.|It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.
{23855}{23970}If I get it, I will become|a Senior Wilderness Explorer.
{23971}{24028}"The wilderness must be explored!"
{24029}{24106}Caw, caw! Raar!
{24107}{24173}It's gonna be great!|There's a big ceremony,
{24174}{24258}and all the dads come,|and they pin on our badges.
{24259}{24308}So, you want to assist an old person?
{24309}{24425}Yep! Then I'll be|a Senior Wilderness Explorer.
{24426}{24501}- You ever heard of a snipe?|- Snipe?
{24502}{24545}Bird. Beady eyes.
{24546}{24653}Every night it sneaks in my yard|and gobbles my poor azaleas.
{24654}{24782}I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it.|If only someone could help me.
{24783}{24872}- Me, me! I'll do it!|- I don't know. It's awfully crafty.
{24873}{24940}You'd have to clap your hands|three times to lure it in.
{24941}{24985}I'll find him, Mr. Fredricksen!
{24986}{25044}I think its burrow is two blocks down.|If you go past...
{25045}{25140}Two blocks down. Got it! Snipe.
{25141}{25189}Here, snipey, snipey.
{25190}{25232}Bring it back here when you find it.
{25233}{25260}Snipe!
{25261}{25322}Okay, keep her coming.|Keep coming.
{25323}{25421}And stop. Stop. Stop!
{25442}{25525}Why... Hey! Hey, you!
{25526}{25562}What do you...|What do you think you're doing?
{25563}{25624}- I am so sorry, sir.|- Don't touch that!
{25625}{25662}No, no, no.|Let me take care of that for you.
{25663}{25714}- Get away from our mailbox!|- Hey. Sir, I...
{25715}{25753}I don't want you to touch it!
{25754}{25809}Ow!
{26038}{26136}Steve, you all right?
{26915}{26969}Sorry,|Mr. Fredricksen.
{26970}{27070}You don't seem like|a public menace to me. Take this.
{27071}{27292}The guys from Shady Oaks will be by|to pick you up in the morning, okay?
{27497}{27602}What do I do now, Ellie?
{29705}{29742}Morning, gentlemen.
{29743}{29850}Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.|You ready to go?
{29851}{29893}Ready as I'll ever be.
{29894}{29950}Would you do me a favor|and take this?
{29951}{30009}I'll meet you at the|van in just a minute.
{30010}{30124}I wanna say one last goodbye|to the old place.
{30125}{30244}Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.
{30245}{30341}That's typical. He's probably|going to the bathroom for the 80th time.
{30342}{30498}You think he'd take better|care of his house.
{31426}{31618}So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard|from Paradise Falls!
{32698}{32756}Heh!
{33666}{33771}We're on our way, Ellie.
{34840}{34898}Huh?
{34988}{35046}Hmm.
{35388}{35471}Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell.
{35472}{35521}What are you doing out here, kid?
{35522}{35613}I found the snipe|and I followed it under your porch,
{35614}{35820}but this snipe had a long tail|and looked more like a large mouse.
{35869}{35921}Please let me in.
{35922}{35977}No.
{36062}{36177}Oh, alright, you can come...
{36308}{36366}Huh.
{36396}{36493}I've never been|in a floating house before.
{36494}{36600}Goggles. Look at this stuff.|Wow! You're going on a trip?
{36601}{36685}"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."
{36686}{36729}You're going to South America,|Mr. Fredricksen?
{36730}{36776}Don't touch that! You'll soil it.
{36777}{36827}You know, most people take a plane,
{36828}{36909}but you're smart because you will|have all your TV and clocks and stuff.
{36910}{36981}Whoa.|Is this how you steer your house?
{36982}{37045}Does it really work?
{37046}{37077}Kid, would you stop with the...
{37078}{37117}- This makes it go right.|- Let go of that...
{37118}{37181}- And that way's left.|- Knock it off!
{37182}{37244}Hey, look! Buildings.
{37245}{37401}That building's so close|I could almost touch it.
{37402}{37461}Wow! This is great!
{37462}{37516}You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen.
{37517}{37599}Look, there's a bus that could|take me home two blocks away!
{37600}{37676}Hey! I can see your house from here.
{37677}{37780}Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa!
{37781}{37821}Well, that's not gonna work.
{37822}{37899}I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus.
{37900}{37935}Did you know that
{37936}{37981}the cumulonimbus forms
{37982}{38008}when warm air rises over cool air?
{38009}{38089}Stayed up all night|blowing up balloons... for what?
{38090}{38117}...and that's how we get lightning.
{38118}{38181}- That's nice, kid.|- Mr. Fredricksen?
{38182}{38232}There's a storm coming.|It's starting to get scary.
{38233}{38353}We're gonna get blown to bits!|We're in big trouble...
{38354}{38498}- What are you doing over there?|- Look.
{38693}{38784}See? Cumulonimbus.
{39601}{39668}My pack!
{39750}{39815}Got ya!
{40678}{40783}I thought you were dead.
{40789}{40817}What happened?
{40818}{40901}I steered us. I did.|I steered the house.
{40902}{40929}Steered us?
{40930}{40997}After you tied your stuff down,|you took a nap.
{40998}{41059}So I went ahead|and steered us down here.
{41060}{41134}Yeah. Sure.
{41409}{41452}Can't tell where we are.
{41453}{41501}Oh, we're in South America, all right.
{41502}{41596}It was a cinch|with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.
{41597}{41657}- GP... What?|- My dad gave it to me.
{41658}{41757}It shows exactly where we are|on the planet.
{41758}{41892}With this baby, we'll never be lost!
{41941}{42001}Oops.
{42005}{42061}We'll get you down, find a bus stop,
{42062}{42137}you just tell the man|you wanna go back to your mother.
{42138}{42299}Sure, but I don't think|they have buses in Paradise Falls.
{42300}{42359}There. That ought to do it.
{42360}{42405}Here, I'll give you|some change for bus fare.
{42406}{42485}No, I'll just use|my city bus pass.
{42486}{42557}Whoa. That's gonna be|like a billion transfers
{42558}{42663}to get back to my house.
{42754}{42825}Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?
{42826}{42964}Well, we're up pretty high.|Could take hours to get down.
{42965}{43060}That thing was... building or something.
{43061}{43109}What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?
{43110}{43244}We can't be close to the ground yet.
{43385}{43469}Wait! Wait, no, don't! Don't, don't!
{43470}{43559}Wait, wait. Wait!
{43649}{43788}- Russell, hang on! Hey!|- Whoa! Whoa!
{43893}{43957}Aaaagggghhhhh!
{43958}{43995}- Walk back. Walk back.|- Okay.
{43996}{44085}Come on. Come on.
{44341}{44417}Where... Where are we?
{44418}{44584}This doesn't look like the city|or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.
{44585}{44702}Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.
{45248}{45325}There it is.
{45957}{46065}Ellie, it's so beautiful.
{46073}{46113}We made it.
{46114}{46229}We made it! Russell! We could float|right over there! Climb up. Climb up!
{46230}{46265}You mean, assist you?
{46266}{46424}- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.|- Okay. I'll climb up.
{46461}{46557}- Watch it!|- Sorry.
{46681}{46804}Now, when you get up there,|go ahead and hoist me up!
{46805}{46870}Got it?
{46933}{47031}You on the porch yet?
{47138}{47188}What? That's it?
{47189}{47353}I came all this way just to get stuck|at the wrong end of this rock pile?
{47354}{47416}Great.
{47474}{47613}Hey, if I could assist you over there,|would you sign off on my badge?
{47614}{47717}- What are you talking about?|- We could walk your house to the falls.
{47718}{47805}- Walk it?|- Yeah! After all, we weigh it down.
{47806}{47985}We could walk it right over there.|Like a parade balloon.
{47986}{48069}Now, we're gonna walk|to the falls quickly and quietly
{48070}{48139}- with no rap music or flash dancing.|- Uh-huh.
{48140}{48252}We have three days, at best, before|the helium leaks out of those balloons.
{48253}{48313}And if we're not at the falls|when that happens...
{48314}{48371}- Sand.|...we're not getting to the falls.
{48372}{48437}I found sand!
{48438}{48618}Don't you worry, Ellie.|We'll get our house over there.
{48634}{48701}This is fun already, isn't it?
{48702}{48791}By the time we get there,|you're gonna feel so assisted.
{48792}{48880}Oh, Mr. Fredricksen,|if we happen to get separated,
{48881}{48933}use the Wilderness Explorer call.
{48934}{49011}Caw, caw! Raar!
{49012}{49077}Wait. Why are we going|to Paradise Falls again?
{49078}{49129}Hey, let's play a game.
{49130}{49209}It's called|"see who can be quiet the longest."
{49210}{49327}Cool!|My mom loves that game!
{50774}{50848}Darn thing!
{50854}{50899}Come on, Russell.|Would you hurry it up?
{50900}{51007}I'm tired. And my knee hurts.
{51008}{51055}Which knee?
{51056}{51164}My elbow hurts,|and I have to go to the bathroom.
{51165}{51232}I asked you about that five minutes ago.
{51233}{51325}Well, I didn't have to go then!
{51326}{51465}I don't wanna walk|anymore. Can we stop?
{51466}{51541}Russell, if you don't hurry up,|the tigers will eat you.
{51542}{51685}There are no tigers in South America.|Zoology.
{51686}{51777}Oh, for the love of Pete! Go on into|the bushes and do your business.
{51778}{51883}Okay! Here! Hold my stuff.
{51884}{52006}I've always wanted to try this.
{52033}{52067}Mr. Fredricksen,
{52068}{52169}am I supposed to dig the hole|before or after?
{52170}{52236}None of my concern!
{52237}{52291}Oh. It's before!
{52292}{52388}Bah!|La la la la la!
{52412}{52470}Huh?
{52476}{52541}Tracks?
{52544}{52606}Snipe.
{52614}{52732}Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe.
{52733}{52795}Snipe.
{52798}{52856}Huh?
{53224}{53313}Ha! Gotcha! Don't be|afraid, little snipe.
{53314}{53439}I am a Wilderness Explorer,|so I'm a friend to all of nature.
{53440}{53524}Want some more?
{53540}{53681}Hi, boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out.
{53686}{53815}Come on. Come on.|Don't be afraid, little snipe.
{53816}{53935}Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice...
{53936}{54013}Giant snipe.
{54093}{54175}- I found the snipe!|- Oh! Did you?
{54176}{54248}- Are they tall?|- Oh, yes, they're very tall.
{54249}{54323}- Do they have a lot of colors?|- They do, indeed!
{54324}{54473}- Do they like chocolate?|- Oh, yes... chocolate?
{54474}{54539}- Gah! What is that thing?|- It's a snipe!
{54540}{54589}There's no such thing as a snipe!
{54590}{54713}- But you said snipes eat your... Whoa!|- Hey!
{54714}{54834}Go on! Get out of here! Go on!
{54852}{54912}Whoa!
{54934}{54994}Whoa!
{55017}{55044}Careful, Russell!
{55045}{55149}Hey, look, Mr. Fredricksen.|It likes me. Whoa!
{55150}{55237}- Russell!|- No, stop! That tickles.
{55238}{55353}Get out of here! Go on! Get!
{55464}{55597}Uh-oh. No, no, no! Kevin!|It's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice.
{55598}{55703}- Kevin?|- Yeah. That's his name I just gave him.
{55704}{55853}Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!|Hey! That's mine!
{55914}{55977}Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!
{55978}{56062}Go on! Beat it!
{56137}{56175}Can we keep him? Please?
{56176}{56271}I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him.|I'll change his newspapers.
{56272}{56327}No.
{56330}{56433}"An Explorer is a friend to all,|be it plants or fish or tiny mole."
{56434}{56513}- That doesn't even rhyme.|- Yeah, it does.
{56514}{56596}- Hey, look. Kevin.|- What?
{56597}{56727}Get down! You're not allowed up there!
{56728}{56845}You come down here right now!
{56856}{56884}Sheesh!
{56885}{56936}Can you believe this, Ellie?
{56937}{56985}Ellie?
{56986}{57077}Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird?
{57078}{57139}Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
{57140}{57181}She said for you to let me.
{57182}{57233}But I told him no. I told you no!
{57234}{57292}N-O.
{57562}{57649}I see you back there.
{57650}{57743}Go on! Get out of here! Shoo!|Go annoy someone else for a while.
{57744}{57861}Hey, are you okay over there?
{57878}{57955}Uh... Hello?
{58036}{58065}Oh!
{58066}{58129}Hello, sir! Thank goodness.
{58130}{58189}It's nice to know|someone else is up here.
{58190}{58248}I can smell you.
{58249}{58352}What? You can smell us?
{58364}{58450}I can smell you.
{58580}{58607}Hey.
{58608}{58701}You were talking to a rock.
{58702}{58743}Hey, that one looks like a turtle.
{58744}{58849}Look at that one!|That one looks like a dog.
{58850}{58919}- It is a dog!|- What?
{58920}{59032}We're not allowed to have dogs|in my apartment.
{59033}{59084}Hey, I like dogs.
{59085}{59133}We have your dog!
{59134}{59184}- Whoa!|- Wonder who he belongs to.
{59185}{59277}Sit, boy. Hey, look,|he's trained. Shake.
{59278}{59305}Uh-huh.
{59306}{59368}- Speak.|- Hi, there.
{59369}{59428}Did that dog just say "Hi, there"?
{59429}{59473}Oh, yes.
{59474}{59584}My name is Dug.|I have just met you, and I love you.
{59585}{59664}My master made me this collar.|He is a good and smart master,
{59665}{59793}and he made me this collar|so that I may talk. Squirrel!
{59794}{59828}My master is good and smart.
{59829}{59856}It's not possible.
{59857}{59917}Oh, it is,|because my master is smart.
{59918}{59995}- Cool! What do these do, boy?|- Hey, would you...
{59996}{60052}I use that collar...
{60053}{60108}...to talk with.|I would be happy if you stopped.
{60109}{60192}Russell, don't touch that!|It could be radioactive or something!
{60193}{60225}I am a great tracker.
{60226}{60301}My pack sent me on a special mission|all by myself.
{60302}{60329}Have you seen a bird?
{60330}{60385}I want to find one,|and I've been on the scent.
{60386}{60473}I am a great tracker.|Did I mention that?
{60474}{60508}Hey, that is the bird.
{60509}{60580}I have never seen one up close,|but this is the bird.
{60581}{60641}May I take your bird back to camp|as my prisoner?
{60642}{60740}Yes, yes, take it. And on the way,|learn how to bark like a real dog.
{60741}{60795}I can bark.
{60796}{60890}And here's howling.
{60922}{60985}Can we keep him?|Please, please, please!
{60986}{61064}- No.|- But it's a talking dog!
{61065}{61152}It's just a weird trick or something.|Let's get to the falls.
{61153}{61195}Please be my prisoner.
{61196}{61313}Oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner!
{61314}{61395}Oh! Here it is.|I picked up the bird's scent!
{61396}{61459}Wait a minute, wait a minute!|What is this?
{61460}{61500}Chocolate. I smell chocolate.
{61501}{61619}I'm getting prunes|and denture cream! Who are they?
{61620}{61668}Oh, man,|Master will not be pleased.
{61669}{61781}We better tell him someone|took the bird. Right, Alpha?
{61782}{61809}No.
{61810}{61889}Soon enough the bird|will be ours yet again.
{61890}{61931}Find the scent, my compadres,
{61932}{61976}and you too shall|have much rewardings
{61977}{62053}from Master for the toil factor|you wage.
{62054}{62133}Hey, Alpha, I think there's|something wrong with your collar.
{62134}{62165}You must've bumped it.
{62166}{62286}Yeah,|your voice sounds funny!
{62306}{62457}Beta! Gamma!|Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel!
{62458}{62509}Mayhaps you desire|to challenge the ranking
{62510}{62573}that I have been assigned|by my strength and cunning.
{62574}{62687}No, no, no. But maybe|Dug would. You might wanna ask him.
{62688}{62808}Yeah. I wonder if he's found|the bird on his very special mission.
{62809}{62866}Do not mention Dug|to me at this time.
{62867}{63035}His fool's errand will keep him|most occupied. Most occupied indeed.
{63036}{63111}Do you not agree with that|which I am saying to you now?
{63112}{63216}Sure, but the second Master|finds out you sent Dug out by himself,
{63217}{63269}none of us will get a treat.
{63270}{63374}You are wise,|my trusted lieutenant.
{63375}{63444}This is Alpha calling Dug.|Come in, Dug.
{63445}{63508}Hi, Alpha.|Hey, your voice sounds funny.
{63509}{63584}I know, I know!|Have you seen the bird?
{63585}{63652}Why, yes.|The bird is my prisoner now.
{63653}{63730}Yeah, right!
{63737}{63780}Impossible! Where are you?
{63781}{63816}I am here with the bird,
{63817}{63884}and I will bring it back,|and then you will like me.
{63885}{63944}- Gotta go.|- Hey, Dug, who you talking to?
{63945}{63992}- No, wait, wait!|- What's Dug doing?
{63993}{64038}Why's he with|that small mailman?
{64039}{64123}Where are they?
{64136}{64234}There he is. Come on!
{64294}{64360}Oh, please, oh, please,|oh, please be my prisoner.
{64361}{64396}Dug, stop bothering Kevin!
{64397}{64476}That man there says|I can take the bird,
{64477}{64512}and I love that man there|like he is my master.
{64513}{64540}I am not your master!
{64541}{64579}I am warning you|once again, bird.
{64580}{64629}- Hey! Quit it!|- I am jumping on you now, bird.
{64630}{64686}Russell, at this rate,|we'll never get to the falls.
{64687}{64761}Here, bird.
{64910}{64957}I am nobody's master, got it?
{64958}{65018}I don't want you here,|and I don't want you here!
{65019}{65051}I'm stuck with you!
{65052}{65117}And if you two don't clear out of here|by the time I count to three...
{65118}{65186}A ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy!|A ball!
{65187}{65278}Ball? Yeah, yeah? You want it, boy?
{65279}{65311}Huh? Huh? Yeah. Yeah?
{65312}{65362}Yes, I do!|I do ever so want the ball.
{65363}{65399}- Go get it!|- Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
{65400}{65445}I will get it and then bring it back!
{65446}{65484}Quick, Russell.|Give me some chocolate.
{65485}{65544}- Why?|- Just give it to me!
{65545}{65619}Bird. Bird!
{65635}{65685}Come on, Russell.
{65686}{65801}Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.
{65868}{65959}What are we doing?
{66024}{66189}Hey, we're pretty far now.|Kevin's gonna miss me.
{66263}{66357}I think that did the trick.
{66358}{66410}Hi, Master.
{66411}{66483}Afternoon.
{67053}{67132}Well, thanks for keeping us|dry anyway, Ellie.
{67133}{67217}Which one's the front?
{67218}{67248}Oh, boy.
{67249}{67374}Is this step three or step five?
{67393}{67455}There.
{67518}{67626}All done! That's for you.
{67726}{67753}Oh...
{67754}{67809}Tents are hard.
{67810}{67945}Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy,|with the GPMs and the badges?
{67946}{68057}Yeah, but can I tell you a secret?
{68058}{68139}- No.|- All right. Here it goes.
{68140}{68236}I never actually built a tent before.|There, I said it.
{68237}{68289}You've been camping before,|haven't you?
{68290}{68360}Well, never outside.
{68361}{68453}Well, why didn't you ask your dad|how to build a tent?
{68454}{68523}I don't think he wants|to talk about this stuff.
{68524}{68588}Well, why don't you try him sometime.|Maybe he'll surprise you.
{68589}{68646}Well, he's away a lot.|I don't see him much.
{68647}{68687}He's gotta be home sometime.
{68688}{68791}Well, I call, but Phyllis told me|I bug him too much.
{68792}{68884}Phyllis? You call your own mother|by her first name?
{68885}{68981}Phyllis isn't my mom.
{68982}{69037}Oh.
{69179}{69278}But he promised|he'd come to my Explorer ceremony
{69279}{69376}to pin on|my Assisting the Elderly badge.
{69377}{69528}So, he can show me|about tents then, right?
{69604}{69673}Hey, why don't you get some sleep?
{69674}{69809}Don't wanna wake up|the traveling flea circus.
{69810}{69847}Mr. Fredricksen?
{69848}{69937}Dug says he wants|to take Kevin prisoner.
{69938}{70037}We have to protect him.
{70038}{70125}Can Kevin go with us?
{70126}{70187}All right, he can come.
{70188}{70250}Promise you won't leave him?
{70251}{70364}- Yeah.|- Cross your heart?
{70507}{70591}Cross my heart.
{70677}{70809}What have I got myself into, Ellie?
{71293}{71386}Morning, sweetheart.
{71387}{71485}We better get moving.
{71490}{71523}Bird's gone.
{71524}{71629}Maybe Russell won't notice.|All right, everybody up!
{71630}{71738}Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!|Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!
{71739}{71832}Find the bird, find the bird!|Hi, hi. Point!
{71833}{71924}Look. There he is!
{71936}{71972}Point!
{71973}{72062}Hey! That's my food! Get off my roof!
{72063}{72166}Yeah, get off of his...
{72227}{72254}What is it doing?
{72255}{72339}The bird is calling to her babies.
{72340}{72407}Her babies.
{72408}{72492}Kevin's a girl?
{72502}{72593}Her house is over there|in those twisty rocks.
{72594}{72709}She has been gathering food for|her babies and must get back to them.
{72710}{72811}Wait. Kevin's just leaving?
{72812}{72873}But you promised to protect her.
{72874}{72954}Her babies need her.|We gotta make sure they're together!
{72955}{73062}Sorry, Russell.|We've lost enough time already.
{73063}{73123}Yeah.
{73274}{73353}This was her favorite chocolate.
{73354}{73490}Because you sent her away,|there's more for you.
{73491}{73517}Huh?
{73518}{73580}Kevin?
{73994}{74065}Where's the bird?|You said you had the bird.
{74066}{74096}Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
{74097}{74171}Since I have said that,|I can see how you would think that.
{74172}{74247}- Where is it?|- Uh... Tomorrow.
{74248}{74370}Come back tomorrow, and then|I will again have the bird. Yes.
{74371}{74471}You lost it!|Why do I not have a surprised feeling?
{74472}{74551}Well, at least you now have led us|to the small mailman
{74552}{74651}and the one who smells of prunes.
{74652}{74713}Master will be most pleased|we have found them
{74714}{74785}and will ask of them many questions.|Come!
{74786}{74930}Wait. We're not going with you!|We're going to the falls!
{74931}{75020}Get away from me!
{75049}{75119}Get down!
{76384}{76444}Stay!
{76607}{76680}You came here in that?
{76681}{76728}Uh, yeah.
{76729}{76846}In a house? A floating house?
{77025}{77106}That is the darnedest thing|I've ever seen.
{77107}{77177}You're not after my bird, are you?
{77178}{77240}But if you needed to borrow|a cup of sugar,
{77241}{77344}I'd be happy to oblige.
{77376}{77448}Well, this is all a misunderstanding.
{77449}{77506}My dogs made a mistake.
{77507}{77566}Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?
{77567}{77631}Yeah, well, yes.
{77632}{77691}THE Charles Muntz?
{77692}{77739}"Adventure is out there!"
{77740}{77831}It's really him! That's Charles Muntz!
{77832}{77914}- It is? Who's Charles Muntz?|- Him!
{77915}{77960}- Yes! Yes! That's him!|- I'm Carl Fredricksen.
{77961}{78030}My wife and I,|we were your biggest fans.
{78031}{78128}Oh, well. You're a man of good taste.
{78129}{78182}Now, you must be tired. Hungry?
{78183}{78212}Uh-huh.
{78213}{78246}Now, attention, everyone!
{78247}{78391}These people are no longer intruders!|They are our guests.
{78392}{78450}Follow me.|I like you temporarily.
{78451}{78493}You do smell like prunes.
{78494}{78554}Whoa!
{78558}{78586}I will not bite you.
{78587}{78675}The small mailman|smells like chocolate.
{78676}{78729}I'm sorry about the dogs.
{78730}{78803}- Hope they weren't too rough on you.|- We weren't.
{78804}{78972}Go ahead and moor|your airship right next to mine.
{79022}{79109}We're not actually going inside|the Spirit of Adventure itself?
{79110}{79140}Oh...
{79141}{79180}Would you like to?
{79181}{79248}Would I?
{79262}{79326}Wait up, Mr. Muntz.
{79327}{79371}Jiminy Cricket.
{79372}{79422}- Not you.|- What do we do with Dug?
{79423}{79593}He has lost the bird.|Put him in the Cone of Shame.
{79632}{79720}I do not like the Cone of Shame.
{79721}{79824}Well, most of the collection|is housed in the world's top museums,
{79825}{79923}New York, Munich, London.|Of course, I kept the best for myself.
{79924}{79993}Did you ever! Will you look at that?
{79994}{80055}Oh, yes, the Arsinoitherium.
{80056}{80122}Beast charged|while I was brushing my teeth.
{80123}{80190}Used my shaving kit to bring him down.
{80191}{80233}Oh, yeah. Well, surprise me.
{80234}{80293}Only way to get it out|of Ethiopia at the time
{80294}{80374}was to have it declared|as dental equipment.
{80375}{80457}Oh, my gosh!|The giant Somalian leopard tortoise!
{80458}{80534}Oh, you recognize it. I'm impressed.
{80535}{80593}That's an interesting story there.
{80594}{80636}Excellent choice.
{80637}{80729}I found it on safari with Roosevelt.
{80730}{80824}He and I fell into a habit|of playing gin rummy in the evenings,
{80825}{80870}and did he cheat!
{80871}{80939}Oh, he was horrible.
{80940}{81010}Master, dinner is ready.
{81011}{81063}Oh, dear. Broken translator.
{81064}{81175}It's that loose wire again.|There you go, big fella.
{81176}{81210}Thank you, Master.
{81211}{81292}I liked his other voice.
{81293}{81398}Well, dinner is served. Right this way.
{81399}{81476}So, how are things stateside, huh?
{81477}{81559}Almost tempted to go back a few times,
{81560}{81624}but I have unfinished work here.
{81625}{81698}Please. I hope you're hungry,
{81699}{81864}because Epsilon is the finest chef|I've ever had.
{81917}{81990}Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!
{81991}{82049}Yes!
{82053}{82110}Hey! Hey!
{82111}{82185}Oh, my Ellie would've loved all this.
{82186}{82246}You know, it's because of you|she had this dream
{82247}{82312}to come down here|and live by Paradise Falls.
{82313}{82375}I'm honored. And now you've made it.
{82376}{82436}You're sure we're not a bother?|I'd hate to impose.
{82437}{82535}No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests,|a real treat.
{82536}{82598}- Treat! Where's the treat!|- Treat!
{82599}{82646}No, no. Quiet!|Calm down, calm down.
{82647}{82682}- I want a treat! I want a treat!|- Hey!
{82683}{82722}I shouldn't have used that word.
{82723}{82790}Having guests is a delight.
{82791}{82885}More often I get thieves|come to steal what's rightfully mine.
{82886}{82941}No!
{82972}{83092}They called me a fraud, those...
{83093}{83208}But once I bring back this creature,|my name will be cleared.
{83209}{83305}Beautiful, isn't it?
{83320}{83430}I've spent a lifetime tracking it.
{83431}{83545}Sometimes years go by|between sightings.
{83546}{83675}I've tried to smoke it out of that|deathly labyrinth where it lives.
{83676}{83727}You can't go in after it.
{83728}{83795}Once in, there's no way out.
{83796}{83899}I've lost so many dogs.
{83907}{84030}And here they come, these bandits,|and think the bird is theirs to take.
{84031}{84217}But they soon find that this mountain|is a very dangerous place.
{84218}{84316}Hey, that looks like Kevin.
{84317}{84386}- Kevin?|- Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet.
{84387}{84438}I trained it to follow us.
{84439}{84526}Follow you? It's impossible. How?
{84527}{84595}- She likes chocolate.|- Chocolate?
{84596}{84683}Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.|She goes gaga for it.
{84684}{84804}But it ran off. It's gone now.
{84918}{85029}You know, Carl, these people|who pass through here,
{85030}{85156}they all tell pretty good stories.
{85157}{85254}A surveyor making a map.
{85255}{85375}A botanist cataloguing plants.
{85384}{85542}An old man taking his house|to Paradise Falls.
{85677}{85883}I mean, that's the best one yet.|I can't wait to hear how it ends.
{86007}{86095}Well, it's been a wonderful evening,|but we better be going.
{86096}{86129}Oh, you're not leaving.
{86130}{86218}We don't want to take advantage|of your hospitality.
{86219}{86297}- Come on, Russell.|- But we haven't even had dessert yet.
{86298}{86375}The boy's right.|You haven't had dessert.
{86376}{86509}Epsilon here makes|a delicious cherries jubilee.
{86510}{86599}Oh, you really must stay. I insist.
{86600}{86732}We have so much more to talk about.
{86760}{86822}Kevin?
{86973}{87045}It's here.
{87059}{87129}Get them!
{87149}{87208}- Hurry!|- I am hurrying!
{87209}{87307}Ahhh! They're coming!
{87315}{87406}Master, over here.
{87748}{87863}Go toward the light, Master!
{88496}{88563}Russell!
{88636}{88706}Get back!
{88736}{88856}Go on, Master!|I will stop the dogs!
{88857}{88941}Stop, you dogs.
{89157}{89217}Whoa!
{89576}{89615}Help!
{89616}{89676}Help!
{89724}{89801}Caw, caw! Raar!|Caw, caw! Raar!
{89802}{89893}Give me your hand!
{90116}{90205}Hang on to Kevin!
{90914}{90976}Kevin.
{91516}{91631}Oh, no, no, no. Kevin. Stay down.
{91632}{91795}She's hurt real bad.|Can't we help her get home?
{92000}{92120}All right, but we gotta hurry.
{92221}{92258}You lost them?
{92259}{92288}No, it was Dug.
{92289}{92400}Yeah. He's with them.|He helped them escape!
{92401}{92434}Wait.
{92435}{92529}Wait a minute. Dug.
{92655}{92683}See anything?
{92684}{92773}No. My pack is not following us.|Boy, they are dumb.
{92774}{92805}This is crazy.
{92806}{92893}I finally meet my childhood hero,|and he's trying to kill us. What a joke!
{92894}{92929}Hey, I know a joke.
{92930}{92977}A squirrel walks up to a tree and says,
{92978}{93055}"I forgot to store acorns for winter|and now I am dead."
{93056}{93217}Ha! It is funny|because the squirrel gets dead.
{93222}{93265}Careful, Russell.
{93266}{93352}You okay, Kevin?
{93426}{93481}You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
{93482}{93553}The wilderness isn't quite|what I expected.
{93554}{93599}Yeah? How so?
{93600}{93663}It's kind of wild.
{93664}{93745}I mean, it's not how they made it sound|in my book.
{93746}{93793}Get used to that, kid.
{93794}{93853}My dad made it sound so easy.
{93854}{93905}He's really good at camping
{93906}{93981}and how to make fire|from rocks and stuff.
{93982}{94062}He used to come to all|my Sweat Lodge meetings.
{94063}{94153}And afterwards,|we'd go get ice cream at Fentons.
{94154}{94221}I always get chocolate|and he gets butter brickle.
{94222}{94294}Then we sit on this one curb|right outside,
{94295}{94389}and I'll count all the blue cars|and he counts all the red ones,
{94390}{94512}and whoever gets the most wins.
{94540}{94629}I like that curb.
{94660}{94718}That might sound boring,
{94719}{94916}but I think the boring stuff|is the stuff I remember the most.
{94992}{95053}Look! There it is!
{95054}{95198}Hey, kid. Hold on, Russell. Stand still.
{95390}{95506}Look at that bird go.|Wait up, you overgrown chicken.
{95507}{95656}That's it. Go, Kevin!|Go find your babies!
{95699}{95785}Run, Kevin! Run!
{95811}{95876}Oh, no!
{95968}{96069}Russell, give me your knife!
{96070}{96171}Get away from my bird!
{96748}{96803}No!
{96934}{96989}No!
{97118}{97229}Careful. We'll want her|in good shape for my return.
{97230}{97319}Let her go! Stop!
{97392}{97454}Kevin!
{97767}{97863}You gave away Kevin.
{97878}{97981}You just gave her away.
{97990}{98175}This is none of my concern.|I didn't ask for any of this!
{98188}{98273}Master, it's alright.
{98274}{98335}I am not your master!
{98336}{98413}And if you hadn't have shown up,|none of this would've happened!
{98414}{98503}Bad dog! Bad dog!
{98668}{98729}Now, whether you assist me or not,
{98730}{98883}I am going to Paradise Falls|if it kills me.
{100546}{100671}Here. I don't want this anymore.
{105926}{105993}Russell?
{106074}{106101}Russell!
{106102}{106217}I'm gonna help Kevin, even if you won't!
{106218}{106304}No, Russell! No!
{107983}{108009}Huh?
{108010}{108077}Russell?
{108090}{108121}Dug!
{108122}{108234}I was hiding under your porch|because I love you. Can I stay?
{108235}{108294}Can you stay?|Well, you're my dog, aren't you?
{108295}{108329}And I'm your master.
{108330}{108366}You're my master?
{108367}{108401}Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
{108402}{108529}Good boy, Dug!|You're a good boy!
{109087}{109145}Yes!
{109162}{109287}Don't worry, Kevin. I'll save...
{109421}{109542}And they wouldn't believe me.|Just wait till they get a look at you.
{109543}{109582}Master?
{109583}{109669}- The small mailman has returned.|- What?
{109670}{109742}Let me go.
{109754}{109841}Where's your elderly friend?
{109842}{109906}He's not my friend anymore.
{109907}{110013}Well, if you're here,|Fredricksen can't be far behind.
{110014}{110093}Where are you|keeping Kevin?
{110094}{110125}Let me go!
{110126}{110180}Scream all you want,|small mailman.
{110181}{110253}None of your mailman friends|can hear you.
{110254}{110419}I'll unleash|all my Wilderness Explorer training!
{110431}{110472}Alpha,|Fredricksen's coming back.
{110473}{110561}Guard that bird. If you see the old man,|you know what to do.
{110562}{110642}Hey, where are you going?|I'm not finished with you!
{110643}{110744}Nice talking with you.
{110766}{110805}Ahhh!
{110806}{110919}Where are you, Fredricksen?
{111302}{111369}Russell!
{111635}{111742}- Mr. Fredricksen!|- Dug, bring her over!
{111743}{111805}You came back for Kevin!|Let's go get her!
{111806}{111860}I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.
{111861}{111890}But I wanna help.
{111891}{111924}I don't want your help.
{111925}{112011}I want you safe.
{112138}{112202}How do we get past these dogs?
{112203}{112265}Point!
{112486}{112542}Kevin.
{112543}{112613}Don't worry, Kevin. We're on our way.
{112614}{112701}Allow no one to be entering|through these doors.
{112702}{112784}Guard well that bird, my minions.
{112785}{112888}What do we do now, Dug?
{113138}{113210}Who wants the ball?
{113211}{113261}- Me! I want it!|- Me! I do!
{113262}{113297}- I want the ball!|- Give it to me!
{113298}{113329}Then go get it!
{113330}{113389}I'm gonna get there first!
{113390}{113425}Getting the ball!
{113426}{113469}I got it!
{113470}{113532}Uh-oh.
{113586}{113657}I'm sorry, Kevin.|Let's get you out of here.
{113658}{113708}Master! He's gone!|The old man!
{113709}{113734}He's here!
{113735}{113788}- He's got the bird!|- The bird's gone...
{113789}{113897}Calm down! One at a time!
{113921}{113989}I... want... to... help!
{113990}{114052}Ha-ha!
{114242}{114278}- He's in Hall D!|- He's in Hall C!
{114279}{114322}It's the old man!
{114323}{114448}Does anyone know where they are?
{114769}{114896}Gray Leader? Take down the house.
{114985}{115017}Gray Leader, checking in.
{115018}{115044}Gray Two, checking in.
{115045}{115150}Gray Three, checking in.
{115181}{115265}Target sighted.
{115416}{115500}Come on, Kevin.
{115628}{115698}Auuggghh!
{115814}{115869}Hi.
{116472}{116640}Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on!|Spit it out!
{116642}{116703}- Come on.|- Enough!
{116704}{116872}I am taking that bird back with me.|Alive or dead!
{117448}{117532}Come on, Kevin.
{117949}{118141}I will have many enjoyments|from what I am about to do, Dug.
{118221}{118269}He wears the Cone of Shame!
{118270}{118421}What?|Do not just continue sitting. Attack!
{118426}{118505}No, no! Stop your laughing!|Get this off of me!
{118506}{118589}Listen, you dog. Sit!
{118590}{118621}Yes, Alpha.
{118622}{118693}Alpha? I am not Alpha. He is...
{118694}{118749}Oh!
{118758}{118840}I can't do it.
{118855}{118888}- Russell!|- Huh?
{118889}{118992}Caw, caw! Raar!|Caw, caw! Raar!
{118993}{119118}You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!
{119454}{119500}Hey, squirrel!
{119501}{119550}Squirrel? Where?|Where? Where?
{119551}{119649}Where's the squirrel?
{119675}{119764}I hate squirrels.

{122847}{122974}Oh, I am ready to not be up high.
{123467}{123593}Sorry about your house,|Mr. Fredricksen.
{123594}{123709}You know, it's just a house.
{123854}{123967}Look at you. You're so soft.
{123968}{124007}Aw!
{124008}{124113}I wish I could keep one.
{124156}{124290}Where's my cane? I just had it here.
{124403}{124503}You know what? Keep them.|A little gift from me to you.
{124504}{124578}Bye, Kevin!
{124767}{124806}Ready?

{126489}{126547}Wow.
{126628}{126689}All right,|I think that covers everybody.

{127194}{127251}- Red one.|- That's a bike.
{127252}{127293}It's red, isn't it?
{127294}{127343}Mr. Fredricksen,|you're cheating.
{127344}{127388}No, I'm not. Red one.
{127389}{127482}That's a fire hydrant.
{127483}{127539}Maybe I need new glasses.
{127540}{127629}Another blue one.
{135266}{135370}Adventure is out there|It's heading our way
{135371}{135475}So grab your scarf and goggles|Let's fly
{135476}{135580}I've mapped out our journey|We're up here to stay

{135686}{135788}My spirit of adventure is you
{135789}{135890}Freaks of nature span a globe|That's too big to deny
{135891}{136006}With canine guards we'll travel there|and spit into their eye
{136007}{136109}Bang, bang|Once the smoke has cleared
{136110}{136205}After all the crowds have cheered

{136941}{137044}I've hung a hundred heads|on my wall

{137258}{137361}The spirit of adventure|is something to indenture
{137362}{137479}My spirit of adventure is you
