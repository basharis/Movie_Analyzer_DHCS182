#I'm not saying
what I did was all right #

00:00:51,274 --> 00:00:55,472
#Trying to break out of the ghetto
was a day-to-day fight #

5
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:59,675
#Been down so long gettin' up
didn't cross my mind #

6
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,653
#But I knew there was a better way
of life and I was just trying to find #

7
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:08,748
#But you don't know what you'll do

00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:12,522

First class only.

42
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,014
Buenos dias.

43
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:48,277
Welcome aboard.
Welcome aboard.

44
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,104
Hi, I'm Sidney. I'm a personal trainer
and Miss Orange County finalist.

45
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:20,706
- This is my TEC-9.
- That there is a TEC-9.

46
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:23,719
Little cheap-ass spray gun
made outta South Miami.

47
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:27,052
It retail for 380,
I get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800.

48
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:30,786
They advertise this TEC-9 as
the most popular gun in American crime.

49
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,227
Can you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the booklet that comes with it.

50
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:37,892
"The most popular gun in American
crime. " Like they're proud of that shit.

51
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:39,492
I love my TEC-9.

52
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:43,498
Let me run this up.

53
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:46,006
- Design emphasis behind this weapon.
- Check out this gun here.

54
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:48,804
This here
is a Styer Aug.

55
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:51,209
Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
Listen.

56
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:56,682
Ooh! That shit's
expensive too, man.

57
00:04:56,752 --> 00:04:58,686
Made in Austria.

58
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:01,848
My customers don't know shit about it,
so there ain't no demand for it.

59
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:05,689
Baby, I really could use me
some more ice.

60
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:10,190
Hold it. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

61
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:14,368
Let me tell you,
though, man.

62
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:17,530
You put this bad boy in a flick,
every motherfucker out there want one.

63
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:19,540
I'm serious
as a heart attack.

64
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:23,271
When them Hong Kong flicks came out,
every nigger in the world had to have a.45.

65
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:25,313
And they ain't want one,
they want two,

66
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,314
'cause all them niggers
want to be the killer.

67
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:29,714
But what them flicks don't tell you
and what they don't know...

68
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:32,549
is that a.45 got a serious
fuckin' jammin' problem.

69
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:35,055
Now, I try to steer my customers
toward a 9 millimeter...

70
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:38,388
'cause it's damn near the same weapon and
it ain't got half the jammin' problems.

71
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,827
But you know how them niggers is
out there. You can't tell 'em shit.

72
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:46,163
They want a. 45.
The killer had a.45, they want a.45.

73
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:50,062
Thanks, baby.

74
00:05:50,138 --> 00:05:54,837
- Who's your partner?
- Cat named Mr. Walker. Runs a fishing boat out of Mexico.

75
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,108
I get the merchandise to him, he gets it out
to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway.

76
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:03,447
Before I set that nigger up, he didn't have a
pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.

77
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:06,681
Now that motherfucker
rollin ' in cash.

78
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:10,020
Got hisself a yacht with all kind
of high-tech navigational shit on it.

79
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:13,193
Here we go.

80
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:17,595
AK-47,
the very best there is.

81
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:22,399
When you absolutely, positively got
to kill every motherfucker in the room,

82
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,404
accept no substitutes.

83
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:28,436
Nothing gets
between me and my AK.

84
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,035
This here
is the Chinese model.

85
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:34,240
I get 'em for 850 and double my money.

86
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:36,250
Grab that for me,
would ya, baby?

87
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:39,651
You know it's for you.

88
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:41,814
Girl, don't make me
put my foot in your ass.

89
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,156
The AK-47 is the most
popular assault rifle in the world.

90
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:50,756
This is the Chinese model. You can tell
by the extra rivets running through-

91
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:55,160
Hello. It's for you.

92
00:07:05,881 --> 00:07:09,180
Yo, Junebug.
What's up?

93
00:07:12,687 --> 00:07:15,349
Yep. Still hanging with
that stripper Chantelle?

94
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:17,357
Boring, isn't it?

95
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:20,627
I can sit through it once.

96
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:22,686
Thinks he's Joe Gunn now.

97
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:25,460
Well, I'm impressed.
He seems to know a lot.

98
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:28,263
He's just repeating shit
he overheard.

99
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:30,429
He ain't any more
of a gun expert than I am.

100
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:33,702
- You want?
- Sure.

101
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:37,040
It shoots
500 rounds of full metal jacket,

102
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:40,946
9- millimeter Luger
at 1,270 feet per second.

103
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:44,042
At ten pounds, it's really heavy
for such a small gun.

104
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:46,349
Demi Moore.

105
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:48,685
Really reduce muzzle lights
during firing.

106
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,827
I've never held anything
that felt so strong.

107
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:58,354
So when'd you get out of jail?

108
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,367
Four days ago.

109
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:03,529
- Where at?
- Susanville.

110
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:05,800
How long?

111
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:09,202
About two months shy
of four years.

112
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:11,745
Four years?

113
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:14,680
- For what?
- Bank robbery.

114
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:16,683
Really?

115
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:21,683
- Ah-iight. Later.
- Shit, I'm impressed.

116
00:08:21,756 --> 00:08:24,623
Ha-ha. See what
I'm talking about?

117
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:27,184
Now, that was about
a man in New York...

118
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:31,164
wants a 9-milimeter Smith and Wesson,
model 5946.

119
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:33,166
And why does
he want it?

120
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:36,067
'Cause it's the same gun that nigger
on New York Undercover uses.

121
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:39,664
'Cause of that nigger,
I'm gonna make 1,250 off of this nigger.

122
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,232
So-
What's your cost?

123
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,302
Low as two.

124
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,008
- You're serious?
- I'm telling you, Louis.

125
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,484
Start adding these figures up, tell me
this ain't the business to be in.

126
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:13,606
- Oh, I got me five M-60
machine guns too. - Hello.

127
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:16,166
Motherfuckers come straight
out the Gulf War.

128
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:18,804
I already sold 3 of them,
20 grand a piece.

129
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,611
- Wow, that's good money.
- I'm gonna make a million dollars out of this, man.

130
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:25,346
I already got a half million
sittin' down in Mexico.

131
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,912
When I deliver this next load,
it'll get me another half mill.

132
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,924
- Then what?
- Then I'm out.

133
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:33,688
Spend the rest
of my life spending.

134
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:36,356
Pull the trigger and let her rip!

135
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:42,032
Hi, my name is Melinda.

136
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:50,704
- Well, you gonna tell me who it is?
- It's Beaumont.

137
00:09:56,384 --> 00:09:58,375
Don't clown on me, bitch.

138
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:03,557
Beaumont, what's up?

139
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,116
What the fuck
you doin' in jail?

140
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:08,662
What the fuck
you doin' that for?

141
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:12,399
Goddamn, nigger.

142
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:16,631
Ain't you got better sense than to be
drunk driving with a goddamn pistol?

143
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:18,638
Beaumont.

144
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:22,665
Beaumont.

145
00:10:22,744 --> 00:10:26,908
Listen to me. Yeah, number one,
you gots to chill.

146
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:28,915
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
'course you're scared.

147
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,281
That's what the motherfuckers get
paid for, to scare the shit out of you.

148
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:33,377
That's their
motherfucking job.

149
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:35,589
The judge doesn't
give a fuck about that.

150
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:38,626
He's ready to habitualize you.
Is that what you want?

151
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:40,684
You wanna look at ten years?

152
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:45,461
Tomorrow I'll get you out, I promise, but
that means I gotta pick you up tonight.

153
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,967
Reggie, there ain't
no two ways about it.

154
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:51,767
You're gonna spend the night in jail, but I
already told you I'm gonna get you out tomorrow.

155
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,174
- Now, where are you?
You're at your mother's?

156
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:58,178
Put your mother on.

157
00:10:58,246 --> 00:11:02,512
Miss Gi 1 more. Miss Gilmore,
this is Max Cherry.

158
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:05,553
This is Reggie's-
That's right, his bail bondsman.

159
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,056
Look, Reggie
is in big trouble.

160
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:12,560
I want to pick him up, and I want you
to be responsible for him before I-

161
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:14,561
Sit down.

162
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:17,928
Yeah, I'd like you to make sure
that he's there when I get there.

163
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:21,298
- And look, this is
a second chance for him.

164
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:23,701
They don't get-
That's correct.

165
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:28,674
All right. So I'm counting on you
to help me help your son.

166
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:31,974
Thank you very much.
Put him back on the line, please.

167
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:35,846
All right, Reggie, we're clear on this.
You got it? Good.

168
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:41,412
Do yourself a really big favor
and be there when I get there.

169
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,354
How can I help you?

170
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:48,020
Where can I put my ash?

171
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:52,459
Use that cup there,
if you like.

172
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:57,871
Oh, and I need me a bond
for 10,000.

173
00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:01,534
- You all right out there?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:04,407
- Have some coffee?
- Go right ahead.

175
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,880
Who's that big, Mandingo-looking nigger
you got up there on that picture with you?

176
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:11,043
- That's Winston. He works here.
- Damn!

177
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:13,883
He's a big 'un, ain't he?
Y'all tight?

178
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:17,015
- Yeah.
- But you're his boss, though, right?

179
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:18,718
Yeah.

180
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:21,557
Bet it was your idea to take
that picture, too, wasn't it?

181
00:12:23,865 --> 00:12:26,857
All right,
you want a $10,000 bond?

182
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:30,666
- What have you got to put up for collateral?
- I'm gonna have to use cash.

183
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:34,970
- You have it with you?
- Got it right here in my rapper bag.

184
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:38,274
- You have cash. What do you need me for?
- Come on, man.

185
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:40,280
You know how they do.

186
00:12:40,348 --> 00:12:44,284
Black man show up with 10,000 cash, first
thing they wanna know is where I got it.

187
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:47,844
Then they gonna want to keep a big chunk
of it, start talkin' that court-cost shit.

188
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:50,482
Fuck that noise, Jack.
I go through you.

189
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:53,026
Cost you a thousand
for the bond.

190
00:12:53,094 --> 00:12:55,756
I can do that.

191
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,060
Who's it for?
A relative?

192
00:12:58,132 --> 00:13:00,532
A fellow named Beaumont.
They got him down in County.

193
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:03,935
Started out drunk driving, but they wrote
it up as possession of a concealed weapon.

194
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:07,839
- Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
- Ten thousand sounds high.

195
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:10,776
They run his name, got a hit.
He been inside.

196
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:13,370
Plus, he from Kentucky, and I think
they're kind of prejudiced...

197
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:16,440
against brothers
from down South out here.

198
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:19,816
If he runs, and I have to go
to Kentucky to bring him back,

199
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,821
you pay the expenses.

200
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:24,153
You think you can do that?

201
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:27,991
I've done it.
What's his full name?

202
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:30,826
Beaumont.
That's all I know.

203
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:36,564
Would you say that Beaumont
is his first or his last name?

204
00:13:36,638 --> 00:13:40,301
Uh, if I had to guess,
I'd say Beaumont's his Christian name.

205
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,674
Records office.

206
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:48,577
Hello, this is Max Cherry,
Cherry Bail Bonds. Who's this, please?

207
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,517
- Ordell, I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Hi, Vicki.

208
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:54,612
All right, man. Cool.
We're almost done here, right?

209
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,522
- Gettin' there.
- Yo, yo.

210
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:01,494
You check out some music while you're
sitting in the car. Take the keys.

211
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:04,759
- Which one's for the car?
- Uh, this one right here.

212
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:08,359
Use that little black thing to turn off
the alarm and unlock the door.

213
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:10,700
- What do I do?
- You ain't gotta do nothing, man.

214
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:13,366
Just point it at the car, push the
button, you hear a little "ooh-ooh-ooh. "

215
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:17,775
- That means the door's unlocked and the alarm's off. Get in.
- Okay.

216
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:20,643
Play the volume loud as you want to,
but don't touch my levels now.

217
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:23,183
- I got them set just like I like 'em.
- Okay.

218
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:36,961
Beaumont Livingston.

219
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:39,158
Livingston, huh?

220
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:43,693
On his prior, he served nine months.
He's working on four years' probation.

221
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:47,002
- You don't say.
- You know what he's on probation for?

222
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:51,739
- Ain't got a clue.
- Possession of unregistered machine guns.

223
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:56,079
Damn. Now, they're gonna consider
that a violation of his probation?

224
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,608
They do consider this
a violation of his probation.

225
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:02,349
Your boy's looking at ten years,

226
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:04,516
plus the concealed weapon.

227
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:09,928
He ain't gonna like that. Beaumont ain't
got a doing-time kind of disposition.

228
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,759
- I need your name and address.
- Ordell Robbie.

229
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:16,895
O- R-D-E-L-L...

230
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:19,098
R- O-B-B-I-E.

231
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:21,767
1436 Florence Boulevard,

232
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:25,404
Compton, 90222.

233
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:30,882
- Is that a house or an apartment?
- That's a house.

234
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:38,457
Who the fuck is this?

235
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:41,654
It's your benefactor, nigger.
I'm comin' up.

236
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:44,357
Come on up, nigger.
It's open.

237
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:46,730
My pleasure of living...

238
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:50,328
demands that I have a good-looking
woman, that I'm with a good-looking woman.

239
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:53,203
I couldn't go out with a woman
old enough to be my wife.

240
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:56,334
- O.D.!
- Ah-ha-ha!

241
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:59,403
- Look at you and your free ass.
- What's up, man?

242
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,675
Come here, boy.
Give me a motherfuckin' hug.

243
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:04,843
- I didn't know you were coming by.
- Yeah.

244
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,853
My nigger.

245
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:09,651
Good lookin' out, man. I don't know
what to say. Thank you, thank you.

246
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:12,352
- Uh-huh. Who was there for
your ass, huh? - You was there.

247
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:14,361
- Who? Who? Who?
- You. You, nigger. You.

248
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:17,262
You goddamn right. See?
That's how that shit works.

249
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,822
You get your ass in trouble,
I get your ass out.

250
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:25,271
That's my motherfucking job. And I don't
mind telling you, nigger, it's steady work.

251
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,831
Hey, look here, man, I'm still scared
as a motherfucker, O.D.

252
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,844
They talkin' like they
serious as hell...

253
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:32,846
givin' me time for
that machine gun shit.

254
00:16:32,914 --> 00:16:35,382
Oh, come on, man. They're just
trying to put a fright in your ass.

255
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,384
If that's what they're doin',
they done did it.

256
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:41,149
- How old is that machine gun shit, huh?
- About three years.

257
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:43,816
Three years? Come on, man,
that's a old crime, man.

258
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:46,826
They ain't got room in the joint for all
these niggers out here killing people now.

259
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:48,828
How they gonna
find room for you?

260
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:50,830
That ain't what
they're telling me.

261
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:54,959
That's why they call it "fuckin' with you. "
Now, let me tell you how we're going to retaliate.

262
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:58,995
All right? Tomorrow I'm gonna pick
you up, take you over to Century City,

263
00:16:59,073 --> 00:17:01,007
introduce you
to my lawyer.

264
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:05,603
Let me tell you something about my lawyer.
This brother's name is Stacin Goins.

265
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,614
This nigger
is a junkyard dog.

266
00:17:07,682 --> 00:17:10,082
He my own personal
Johnny Cochran.

267
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:12,585
Matter of fact,
he kicked Johnny Cochran's ass.

268
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:16,180
And like Johnny Cochran,
this nigger hate cops. I'm serious, man.

269
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:18,851
He live to fuck
with the police.

270
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:21,861
Now, as a favor,
I had him look at your case.

271
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:25,456
He say you ain't got shit to
worry about. They just fuckin' with you.

272
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:31,438
So we're gonna sic the junkyard dog on
their ass and make 'em stop fuckin' with you.

273
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:33,701
Good lookin' out, man. Good
lookin' out.

274
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:36,538
- Come on in, man, and let's celebrate.
- No, no.

275
00:17:36,611 --> 00:17:39,045
Look here, I'm really
supposed to be somewhere.

276
00:17:39,113 --> 00:17:43,072
Matter of fact, I was kind of hoping
you could come run with me.

277
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,084
What you mean?

278
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:47,086
You know, man,

279
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:50,089
I hate to be the kind of nigger
that do a nigger a favor,

280
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:52,489
then bam- hit the nigger up
for a favor in return,

281
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,585
but I gots to be
that kind of nigger.

282
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:57,995
- What? What you want?
- I need a favor, nigger.

283
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:01,000
- That requires me to go out tonight?
- Just a bit.

284
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:03,901
Aw, man, I wasn't plannin'
on goin' no place tonight.

285
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:07,600
It is late as hell, man.
I'm home, I'm high, man. Come on.

286
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,269
And why are you home, huh?

287
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:14,678
You home because I spent $10,000
to get your ass home.

288
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:18,685
Now, look, I got a little problem,
all right?

289
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:21,187
I need some help,
and you can help me out.

290
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:23,780
Go in the house and throw some shit on.
Let's walk out to the car.

291
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,792
Come on.

292
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:31,030
I'm ready, man. What's your problem?
There ain't no problem.

293
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:33,032
It's more like
a situation.

294
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,400
You remember them three M-60 machine guns
I sold last year outta the five I got?

295
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:40,338
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.

296
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:45,004
There's this group of Koreans over in Korea town
startin' this little Neighborhood Watch thing.

297
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,311
They need some weapons so they can show
the neighborhood niggers they mean business.

298
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:53,376
Now, I'm gonna sell them the other
two machine guns, all right?

299
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:56,787
The problem is, I ain't never done
business with these Koreans before.

300
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:59,792
I ain't worried, 'cause by and large
Asians are very dependable.

301
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,794
They don't want no trouble.

302
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:03,989
You might argue with them
about price and shit,

303
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:06,499
but you ain't gotta worry about
them shootin' you in the back.

304
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:08,501
But I got me a rule.

305
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:12,505
Never do business with people you ain't never
done business with before without backup.

306
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:15,167
That's why I need you.
Backup.

307
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:20,270
Look, all you've got to do is lay in
here and hold on to this motherfucker.

308
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:23,749
All right? I'm gonna tell 'em I'm goin'
in the trunk to show 'em the goods.

309
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:26,753
When I open the trunk, you pop up
and rack this motherfucker.

310
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:28,755
Man, fuck that shit.
I ain't for shootin' nobody.

311
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:30,757
I ain't said nothin'
about you shootin' nobody.

312
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:33,350
All you gotta do is hold on to it.
They'll get the idea.

313
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:36,919
You must be out of your mind if you think
I'm gonna get in this dirty-ass trunk.

314
00:19:36,998 --> 00:19:39,193
We ain't goin' nowhere
but to Korea town, man.

315
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:41,359
You ain't gonna be in here
no more than ten minutes.

316
00:19:41,435 --> 00:19:45,201
I ain't ridin' in no trunk for no minute.
Why can't I ride up front with you?

317
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:48,207
You can't ride up front with me.
The surprise element is 90% of it.

318
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:51,767
I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gettin' in no goddamn trunk.

319
00:19:51,846 --> 00:19:54,542
- I can't believe you'd do me like this.
- Do you like what, man?

320
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:58,051
I just ain't climbing in no goddamn,
dirty-ass trunk, man.

321
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:00,053
I got a problem
with small places.

322
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:03,215
I got a problem with spending $10,000 on
ungrateful niggers to get them out of jail,

323
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,224
but I did it.

324
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:07,226
How small was that
jail cell, motherfucker?

325
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:10,559
- I know I owe you, you got to bring all this up.
- Then get your ass in this trunk.

326
00:20:10,631 --> 00:20:14,761
I want to help you, but I won't be
locked in no goddamn trunk of no car.

327
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:17,770
You think I wanted to spend
$10,000 on your ass, huh?

328
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:20,568
- I know you helped me out.
- Do you think I wanted to spend $10,000 on your ass?

329
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:23,075
- Yes or no?
- Of course you didn't, but look, in the trunk?

330
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:26,341
That's the only way I could help you,
right? So that's what I did.

331
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:30,009
Now, look, man, all I'm asking
you to do is get in the trunk,

332
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:33,247
hold this fuckin' shotgun, point it at these
Buddha-heads when I open it, all right?

333
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,256
- You're catching a nigger off-guard with
this shit. - Look here. I tell you what.

334
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:39,622
When we get through fucking
with these Koreans,

335
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:43,186
me and you go to Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles on me.

336
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:45,198
Think about it now.

337
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:48,292
That 'Scoe's Special,
smothered in gravy and onions,

338
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:51,964
side of red beans and rice,
some greens.

339
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:54,439
That's some good eatin'.

340
00:20:54,508 --> 00:20:58,035
Man.

341
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:04,313
Exactly how long do I gotta
be in this motherfucker?

342
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:08,377
Hey, you said ten minutes. Hey,
motherfucker, you like to hit my goddamn head!

343
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:10,720
You pony tail-wearing
motherfucker.

344
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,726
What the hell's wrong
with you?

345
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,917
#Hello, my love
I heard a kiss from you #

346
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:47,552
#Red magic satin
playin' near #

347
00:21:47,628 --> 00:21:50,153
#Too #

348
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:52,893
#All through the morning rain
I gazed #

349
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,527
#The sun doesn't shine #

350
00:21:55,603 --> 00:22:00,768
#Rainfalls and waterfalls
run through my mind #

351
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:03,503
#In the garden I see #

352
00:22:03,577 --> 00:22:06,102
#Washed purple
shower bells and tea #

353
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:11,208
#One early bitter cousin
Misty green #

354
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:14,118
#Pretty music I hear #

355
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:16,782
#So happy in mind #

356
00:23:02,503 --> 00:23:05,301
Do a nigger a favor-

357
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,605
#Baby love
my baby love #

358
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:46,772
#I need you
Oh, how I need you #

359
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:49,782
#But all I you do
is treat me bad #

360
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,877
#Break my heart
and make me sad #

361
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:56,855
#Tell me
what did I do wrong #

362
00:23:56,924 --> 00:24:00,223
#To make you
stay away so long #

363
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:03,661
#'Cause baby love
my baby love #

364
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:08,225
#I'm missin' you, miss kissin' you #

365
00:24:08,302 --> 00:24:10,736
#Instead of breakin'up #
- Excuse me, baby.

366
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:15,173
#Just want some kissin'
and makin' up #

367
00:24:15,242 --> 00:24:17,176
#Don't throw
our love away #

368
00:24:17,244 --> 00:24:21,578
#I n my arms, why don't you stay #

369
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:25,483
- Hello.
- #Need ya, need ya #

370
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:28,419
- Hello, baby.
# Baby love #

371
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:32,585
Well, you know, I'm just doin'
that thing I do, baby.

372
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:39,198
Oh, no. Okay.
Hold on.

373
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:45,504
Uh, Louis, baby. It's Ordell.

374
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:47,836
Oh, I'm just
gonna go pee.

375
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:50,502
# Separate, my love #

376
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:53,740
# All of my
whole life through #

377
00:24:53,814 --> 00:24:56,078
# I never loved no one but you ##
- Hello.

378
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,118
Louis, my man.
What ya doin'?

379
00:24:58,185 --> 00:25:00,710
Okay. Okay.
I'm just hanging out with Simone.

380
00:25:00,788 --> 00:25:03,018
Oh, yeah?
She doin' that show for you?

381
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,887
Yeah.

382
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:08,360
I can hear the Supremes in
the background. She ain't bad, is she?

383
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:11,125
- No, she's pretty good.
- She do Mary Wells for you yet?

384
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:14,429
Nah, I don't know the names of everybody,
but she's done a whole bunch of them.

385
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:16,435
Well, guess where I am?

386
00:25:16,503 --> 00:25:18,528
I don't know.

387
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:21,301
I'm in the cozy confines
of an Oldsmobile...

388
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,536
parked right outside
Simone's house.

389
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,578
- Oh, you're outside?
- Yeah.

390
00:25:25,646 --> 00:25:27,580
- Come on in.
- Ah, no, man.

391
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:29,741
I already caught that show.

392
00:25:29,817 --> 00:25:33,947
I got some for-your-eyes-only shit
to show you. Why don't you step outside?

393
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:43,691
- Who was that?
- That's Beaumont.

394
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:45,698
Who's Beaumont?

395
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:48,530
A employee
I had to let go.

396
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:57,577
What'd he do?

397
00:25:57,644 --> 00:26:02,206
He put hisself in a position where he
was gonna have to do ten years in prison.

398
00:26:02,282 --> 00:26:04,273
That's what he did.

399
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:06,410
And if you
know Beaumont,

400
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:10,389
you know there ain't no goddamn way
he can do ten years.

401
00:26:10,457 --> 00:26:15,224
If you know that, then you know Beaumont's
gonna do anything Beaumont can...

402
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:17,661
to keep from doin'
them ten years,

403
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:21,462
includin' tellin' the federal government
any and every motherfucking thing...

404
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:23,901
about my black ass.

405
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:26,963
Now, that, my friend,
is a clear-cut case...

406
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,168
of him or me,

407
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:31,473
and you best believe...

408
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:33,979
it ain't gonna be me.

409
00:26:36,216 --> 00:26:38,150
Now, Louis,

410
00:26:41,422 --> 00:26:44,721
if you gonna come in
on this thing with me,

411
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:46,760
you've got to
be prepared...

412
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:49,523
to go all the way.

413
00:26:49,596 --> 00:26:52,656
Now, I got me, so far,
a half million dollars in lock boxes...

414
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:55,827
in a bank down
in Cabo San Lucas.

415
00:26:55,903 --> 00:26:58,337
I make this delivery,

416
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:01,101
I'm gonna have me
over a million.

417
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:05,771
Hey, you think I'm gonna let a little
cheese-eatin' nigger like this fuck that up?

418
00:27:05,846 --> 00:27:08,371
You best think again.

419
00:27:08,449 --> 00:27:11,384
Before I let that happen,
I'll shoot this nigger in the head...

420
00:27:11,452 --> 00:27:13,886
and ten niggers
look just like him.

421
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:16,821
You understand
what I'm saying?

422
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,290
Yeah.

423
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,557
- Sowe on the same page then?
- Yeah, I follow.

424
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:30,396
My nigger.

425
00:27:39,913 --> 00:27:42,677
Miss Brown!

426
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:45,684
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargas,
L.A.P.D.

427
00:27:45,752 --> 00:27:49,017
- Can I ask what you have in that bag?
- The usual stuff.

428
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:51,785
You know, I'm a flight
attendant for Cabo Air.

429
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:54,851
- Can I help out here?
- Who's this?

430
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:58,261
Sorry, this is Special Agent Ray Nicollet
with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

431
00:27:58,332 --> 00:28:01,859
- Oh, yeah? May I see some I.D.?
- Yeah. Sure.

432
00:28:03,837 --> 00:28:06,362
Would you mind if we just
took a look in that bag?

433
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,204
Do I mind?
Do I have a choice?

434
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:12,211
- Yeah. You have the right to say no.
- No.

435
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,770
I have the right to make you wait here
with Ray while I go get a warrant.

436
00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:17,783
If I don't want to go to all that trouble,
I'd just take you in on suspicion now.

437
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:21,617
- Suspicion of what?
- Uh, could I say something?

438
00:28:21,688 --> 00:28:24,384
He just wants to peek
inside the bag for a minute.

439
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:27,950
I'll keep my eye on him
so he doesn't take anything.

440
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:31,122
- Go ahead.
- Thanks a lot.

441
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:35,066
Bad knees.

442
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:38,298
You have a good flight?

443
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:42,069
It's a shitty flight down to Cabo. I went
down there one time with Susan, my wife.

444
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:44,838
Fuckin' turbulence
was unbelievable.

445
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:50,643
Hey, can I look
in this envelope?

446
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:58,185
Ah.

447
00:29:00,861 --> 00:29:04,024
Goddamn.

448
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:06,122
I'd say there's
about, oh, uh,

449
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,794
$50,000 here.

450
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:11,201
What would you say, Ray?

451
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:15,037
Looks like about 50,000
from here.

452
00:29:16,944 --> 00:29:20,380
- Is this your money?
- What if I say no?

453
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:24,042
You should know if you bring in anything
over 10,000, you have to declare it.

454
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:26,711
You forget, or what?

455
00:29:26,787 --> 00:29:31,190
You can get a $250,000 fine,
plus two years in prison.

456
00:29:31,258 --> 00:29:34,989
You want to talk to us about this,
or do you want to talk to Customs?

457
00:29:35,062 --> 00:29:37,394
- I'm not sayin' another word.
- Jackie-

458
00:29:37,464 --> 00:29:40,297
I hope you don't mind
if I call you Jackie.

459
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:44,201
Those guys down in Customs? They're a
bunch of pricks. Excuse me, but they are.

460
00:29:44,271 --> 00:29:48,901
There's something about that job makes
those people really hard to get along with.

461
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:51,410
You can go down and talk
with those guys...

462
00:29:51,478 --> 00:29:54,811
who are really suspicious
and really disagreeable human beings,

463
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:59,818
or you can talk with a couple of
good-hearted guys like Mark and myself.

464
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:03,355
It's up to you.

465
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:09,762
Let's take a look here
at the file on Jacqueline Brown.

466
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,561
According to this, this isn't the
first time you've run afoul of the law.

467
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:16,831
In 1985, while
a stewardess for Delta,

468
00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:19,098
you were busted while
carrying drugs for a pilot?

469
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:21,606
That pilot was my husband,
and I got off.

470
00:30:21,675 --> 00:30:24,269
You mean they offered you a deal,
and you grabbed it.

471
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:28,178
He did time, you did probation.

472
00:30:28,248 --> 00:30:31,308
I didn't hear you ask permission
to smoke in my office.

473
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:33,785
- May I smoke?
- No, you may not.

474
00:30:33,854 --> 00:30:36,288
So you get off
with a slap on the wrist,

475
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:40,793
but all this criminal activity fucks up
your shit for good with the big airlines.

476
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:44,729
Cut to 13 years later,
you're 44 years of age,

477
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,132
flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fuckin
'piece of shit Mexican airline there is,

478
00:30:49,202 --> 00:30:51,693
where you make what-
$ 13, 000 a year?

479
00:30:51,772 --> 00:30:54,639
I make 16, 000,
plus benefits.

480
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:58,872
You been in the service industry 19 years,
and all you make is 16,000, plus benefits?

481
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:03,678
Didn't exactly set the world
on fire, did you, Jackie?

482
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,809
Jackie, you have
a good lawyer?

483
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:08,411
Can she afford
a good one, is more like it.

484
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:10,820
Otherwise you'll be
in Sybil Brand three weeks...

485
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:14,657
before the public defender
gets around to ya.

486
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:20,496
- Hey, Jackie, do you know a guy
named Beaumont Livingston?

487
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:23,695
Yeah? No?

488
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,204
Because he knows you.

489
00:31:26,273 --> 00:31:28,264
Well, he knew you.

490
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:31,004
He doesn't know anybody now.
He's dead.

491
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:34,172
They found him in a trunk
of a car this morning,

492
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:36,408
shot twice.

493
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:40,214
Once in the chest,
once in the head.

494
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:42,687
Here you go.
So I guess I'm wondering.

495
00:31:42,756 --> 00:31:45,190
If you don't know Beaumont,

496
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:51,687
why do you suppose Beaumont
knows you?

497
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:59,404
Look, Miss Brown,
we don't give a fuck about you.

498
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:01,407
You know who we want.

499
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:05,241
If you cooperate, tell us what we want
to know, we'll help you get out of this.

500
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:09,305
If you refuse to cooperate, continue to
cop a shit attitude like you're doing now,

501
00:32:09,383 --> 00:32:12,409
we will give you to Customs
and they will take you to court.

502
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:15,011
With your prior, the judge
will give you two years.

503
00:32:15,088 --> 00:32:18,649
Now, you'll probably only end up
serving a year and some change,

504
00:32:18,725 --> 00:32:21,660
but if I was
a 44-year-old black woman...

505
00:32:21,728 --> 00:32:26,256
desperately clinging on to this one shitty,
little job I was fortunate enough to get,

506
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,302
I don't think that I'd think
I had a year to throw away.

507
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:32,930
So let's start again now,
shall we?

508
00:32:33,006 --> 00:32:37,443
Who in Mexico gave you this money, and
who in America were you bringing it to?

509
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:41,174
I'm not sayin'
another goddamn word.

510
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:52,654
I'd like your permission to look through this
again so we'll know how much we're talking about.

511
00:32:52,726 --> 00:32:55,490
Sure. Go ahead.

512
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:01,491
While we're at it,
let's see what else is in there.

513
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:03,536
Do you mind?

514
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:09,070
Beauty case.

515
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:11,838
- Mm-hmm. What's in it?
- Beauty products.

516
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,842
Alarm clock.

517
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:18,180
Glass case.

518
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:21,353
Birth control.

519
00:33:23,957 --> 00:33:27,120
- What's that?
- My diet shit.

520
00:33:27,194 --> 00:33:29,628
Let's see what else
is in there.

521
00:33:31,097 --> 00:33:33,463
Here. Here. Here.

522
00:33:35,168 --> 00:33:39,070
- What's this?
- What's that shit?

523
00:33:41,341 --> 00:33:43,275
Let's go, ladies.
First door on the left.

524
00:33:43,343 --> 00:33:47,439
# Ninety-nine years
is a long, long, long time #

525
00:33:47,514 --> 00:33:52,042
# Ninety-nine years is such
a long, long, long time #

526
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:56,316
# Ninety-nine years
is a long, long time #

527
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:58,653
# Well, look at me #

528
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:01,785
# I'll never be free #

529
00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:04,956
# I'm a long-time woman ##

530
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,899
Brown, case 70032.

531
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:15,941
The charge is...

532
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:20,139
possession of narcotics
with the intent to distribute.

533
00:34:20,213 --> 00:34:24,445
- How does your client plead?
- Uh, Your Honor, she wishes to stand mute.

534
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:26,452
Very well.

535
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,353
Detective... Varga.

536
00:34:29,422 --> 00:34:31,583
- Dargas, Your Honor.
- Sorry.

537
00:34:31,658 --> 00:34:34,786
Uh, you were the arresting officer
in this case?

538
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:37,830
- That's correct, Your Honor.
- And do you have a bail recommendation?

539
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:40,366
- Yes, I do, Your Honor.
- And that would be?

540
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:43,095
Based on the defendant's
prior conviction...

541
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:45,831
and the extreme possibility of flight
due to the occupation,

542
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:48,466
the state requests a bond
of no less than 25,000.

543
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:51,272
You people are fine with this?

544
00:35:00,587 --> 00:35:03,556
I'm gonna set bond
at 10,000...

545
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:06,524
and set the date
of August 21...

546
00:35:06,593 --> 00:35:08,618
for the prelim.

547
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:10,629
Your Honor,
when will that be?

548
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:14,895
That's six weeks from now.
We'll continue this matter then.

549
00:35:14,968 --> 00:35:18,802
Owens, case 72242.

550
00:35:18,872 --> 00:35:21,340
The charge is possession
of a concealed weapon...

551
00:35:21,408 --> 00:35:24,400
and striking an officer.

552
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:27,742
- How does your client plead?
- I thought it'd be 25.

553
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:32,408
Uh, my client
would like to plead guilty, Your Honor.

554
00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:36,251
Is the arresting officer
here in the courtroom?

555
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,663
I didn't hear you
wash your hands.

556
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,800
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

557
00:35:54,874 --> 00:35:59,106
- Door was open, so I just come on in.
- I can see that.

558
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:01,374
- Why?
- Got some more business for you.

559
00:36:01,448 --> 00:36:03,575
Oh, yeah?
What did he do?

560
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,380
She is an airline stewardess.

561
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:09,217
Got caught coming back
from Mexico with some blow.

562
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:12,281
They set her bond
this afternoon at $10,000.

563
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:16,887
Now, I'm figuring you could take
that $10,000 you owe me from Beaumont,

564
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:18,897
move it over
to the stewardess.

565
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:22,059
- The bond for possession's only a thousand.
- Hmm. Yeah.

566
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:26,401
Man, they fuckin' with her. They callin'
that shit "possession with intent. "

567
00:36:26,473 --> 00:36:29,670
A 44-year-old black woman
caught with less than two ounces,

568
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:31,677
they calling that shit "intent. "

569
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:35,545
The same thing happen to a movie star,
they call it "possession. "

570
00:36:35,615 --> 00:36:37,549
Still sounds high.

571
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:42,816
Well, um, she had on her,
I believe it was 50 grand in cash.

572
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:46,188
All right, before we start
talking about stewardesses,

573
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:48,489
Let's get Beaumont
out of the way first.

574
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:50,722
You know, I think
somebody already did.

575
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:53,288
- What?
- You ain't hear?

576
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:57,268
- Hear what?
- Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out.

577
00:36:57,337 --> 00:37:00,272
Oh, shit.
That shit rhymes.

578
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,365
Blew Beaumont's
brains out.

579
00:37:04,077 --> 00:37:06,443
Police make contact
with you?

580
00:37:06,513 --> 00:37:10,040
Oh, hell, yeah.
First motherfucking thing they did.

581
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:12,710
You know, they see I pay
a big money bond for my boy,

582
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:15,721
they start thinking that "where there's
smoke there's fire" logic.

583
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:18,451
Rousted my ass out of bed
.00 in the morning.

584
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:20,720
Scared the shit out
of my woman Sheronda.

585
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:23,729
She thought they was gonna
take my ass away for sure.

586
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:27,358
This stewardess- You know
her last name?

587
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:31,165
Brown.
Jackie Brown.

588
00:37:31,237 --> 00:37:33,728
- What does she do for you?
- Who said she do anything for me?

589
00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:37,368
She's my friend. My friends get
in trouble, I like to help them out.

590
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:39,469
Beaumont worked for you.

591
00:37:39,546 --> 00:37:43,004
This you and me talking,
like lawyer-client thing?

592
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,017
You can't tell nothing
I say to you?

593
00:37:45,085 --> 00:37:48,543
You're not my client till you
get busted and I bond you out.

594
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:52,887
Well, we ain't got no, uh-
What you call that shit?

595
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:54,893
Confidentiality.

596
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:56,895
Why should I
tell you anything?

597
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:59,363
'Cause you want me to know
what a slick guy you are.

598
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:01,798
You got stewardesses
bringing you 50 grand.

599
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:05,133
And why would a stewardess
be bringing me 50 grand?

600
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:08,641
Now you want me to speculate
on what you do.

601
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:13,270
I'd say you were in the drug business, except
the money's moving in the wrong direction.

602
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:18,249
Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting
away with it, so, uh, more power to you.

603
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:20,946
All right.
You want another bond?

604
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,716
You want to move the 10,000 you got
on Beaumont over to the stewardess.

605
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,724
That means paperwork.

606
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,317
I gotta get a death certificate,
present it to the court,

607
00:38:28,394 --> 00:38:31,886
make out a receipt for return of bond
collateral, I type up another application,

608
00:38:31,965 --> 00:38:34,024
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- another indemnity agreement.

609
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,398
- I haven't got time.
- I'm telling you what I have to do.

610
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:38,403
What you have to do,
in case you forgot,

611
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:41,668
- is come up with a premium of a thousand bucks.
- I can do that.

612
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:44,676
You know I got the money.
I just ain't got it with me.

613
00:38:44,744 --> 00:38:47,269
Come back when you do.
I'll bond out the stewardess.

614
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:51,340
Look, you got to look at this
with a little compassion, all right?

615
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:54,580
Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't
used to this kind of treatment.

616
00:38:54,654 --> 00:38:57,521
Gangsters don't give a fuck,
but your average citizen,

617
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,525
a couple of nights in County
get to fuckin' with their mind.

618
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:02,925
Ordell, this isn't a bar.
You don't have a tab.

619
00:39:02,996 --> 00:39:05,089
Listen to me, all right?

620
00:39:05,165 --> 00:39:09,625
You got a 44-year-old, gainfully
employed black woman falsely accused-

621
00:39:09,702 --> 00:39:13,365
Falsely accused? She didn't come
back from Mexico with cocaine on her?

622
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:15,839
Falsely accused
of "intent. "

623
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:19,276
If she had that shit-
and mind you, I'm saying if-

624
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:21,905
that was her own personal shit
to get high with.

625
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:25,542
Is white guilt supposed to make me
forget I'm running a business?

626
00:39:28,454 --> 00:39:30,888
Oh, it's like that, huh?

627
00:39:35,728 --> 00:39:37,662
All right.

628
00:39:40,266 --> 00:39:42,393
I got your little
thousand bucks.

629
00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:47,739
- Hey, Candy.
- Hey, Max.

630
00:39:47,807 --> 00:39:51,800
Dropping off Lopez, Anita.
Picking up Brown, Jackie.

631
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:55,245
- Okay, no problem. You armed?
- You bet I am.

632
00:40:10,396 --> 00:40:13,263
Max, here she comes.

633
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:55,007
# Why do I keep my mind #

634
00:40:55,074 --> 00:40:59,773
# On you all the time #

635
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:02,144
# And I don't even know you #

636
00:41:02,215 --> 00:41:05,184
# I don't know you #

637
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:12,353
# Why do I feel this way #

638
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:14,393
# Thinking about you #

639
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,020
# Every day #

640
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:20,657
# And I don't even know you #

641
00:41:20,733 --> 00:41:23,201
Miss Brown?

642
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:25,794
- Yes?
- # Take me in your arms #

643
00:41:25,872 --> 00:41:28,773
- I'm Max Cherry. I'm your bail bondsman.
- # Thrill me with all #

644
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:32,777
- # Of your charms #
- I could give you a lift home, if you like.

645
00:41:32,845 --> 00:41:38,112
- # And I'll take to the sky on a natural high #
- Okay.

646
00:41:38,184 --> 00:41:42,416
- # Loving you more till the day I die #
- # On a natural high #

647
00:41:42,488 --> 00:41:46,754
- # Take to the sky on a natural high #
- # I want you to be mine #

648
00:41:46,826 --> 00:41:51,422
# Loving you more #

649
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:56,868
# If you have anything to do #

650
00:41:56,936 --> 00:42:01,805
# Call me and I
will do it for you #

651
00:42:01,874 --> 00:42:05,332
You really
a bail bondsman?

652
00:42:05,411 --> 00:42:07,379
Well, who do you
think I am?

653
00:42:07,447 --> 00:42:11,281
- I showed you my card in there.
- Can I see your I.D.?

654
00:42:11,351 --> 00:42:13,945
You're serious?

655
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,889
# That wish would be
for you to live #

656
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:22,826
# Forever and ever #

657
00:42:22,895 --> 00:42:24,829
Who paid my bond?

658
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:27,559
- Ordell?
- I n cash.

659
00:42:29,035 --> 00:42:34,302
# My heart skips a beat #

660
00:42:34,374 --> 00:42:39,175
- # And I take to the sky on a natural high #
- # I just take to the sky #

661
00:42:39,245 --> 00:42:43,909
- # Loving you more till the day I die #
- # On a natural high #

662
00:42:43,983 --> 00:42:48,852
- # Take to the sky on a natural high #
- # I don't know you #

663
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:53,255
# Loving you more ##

664
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:02,267
You got any cigarettes
in here?

665
00:43:02,335 --> 00:43:05,566
You won't find
any cigarettes in there.

666
00:43:07,306 --> 00:43:11,140
- Can we stop and get cigarettes?
- Sure.

667
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:13,770
Have you ever been
to the River Bottom?

668
00:43:13,846 --> 00:43:17,839
- I don't think so.
- It's all right. It's a cop bar.

669
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:21,444
Can we just stop
at a 7-Eleven or something?

670
00:43:21,521 --> 00:43:25,218
- I thought you might like to have a drink.
- I'd love to, but not there.

671
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:29,319
How 'bout the Hilton
by the airport?

672
00:43:29,395 --> 00:43:32,762
- Is it dark?
- Kind of a sports bar.

673
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:35,767
It doesn't sound dark.

674
00:43:35,835 --> 00:43:37,996
Why does it
have to be dark?

675
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:43,031
Because it looks like I just
got out of jail, that's why.

676
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:46,510
You're dropping me off at my place.
There's a joint near me.

677
00:43:56,456 --> 00:43:58,890
No, thanks.
I quit three years ago.

678
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:01,586
- Gain weight?
- Ten pounds.

679
00:44:01,661 --> 00:44:04,425
Take it off and put it back on.

680
00:44:04,497 --> 00:44:08,092
That's why I don't quit.

681
00:44:17,143 --> 00:44:21,204
If I can't fly, I'm gonna have a bitch
of a time trying to find my rent.

682
00:44:24,417 --> 00:44:26,783
You know,

683
00:44:26,853 --> 00:44:30,550
the other day I figured out
that I must have written about...

684
00:44:30,623 --> 00:44:34,218
15,000 bonds since
I've been in the business.

685
00:44:34,293 --> 00:44:38,389
I figure about 80% oft hose
were drug-related, so...

686
00:44:38,464 --> 00:44:42,332
if you want, I could help you
figure out your options.

687
00:44:45,004 --> 00:44:47,529
So far, they told me
if I cooperate,

688
00:44:47,607 --> 00:44:51,202
then I'll get probation,
maybe.

689
00:44:51,277 --> 00:44:54,804
Or if I stand mute,
I can get as much as five years.

690
00:44:54,881 --> 00:44:57,042
Does that sound right?

691
00:44:57,116 --> 00:45:01,075
I'd say that if they try you and convict
you, you won't get more than a year and a day.

692
00:45:01,154 --> 00:45:03,281
That's state time,
prison.

693
00:45:03,356 --> 00:45:05,620
But they won't
want to do that.

694
00:45:05,691 --> 00:45:08,717
They'll offer you simple possession,
a couple of months of county time...

695
00:45:08,794 --> 00:45:11,786
and a year or two
of probation.

696
00:45:11,864 --> 00:45:15,163
Do you happen to know who
put the dope in your bag?

697
00:45:15,234 --> 00:45:17,725
Yeah.

698
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:21,239
But that's not
what this is about.

699
00:45:21,307 --> 00:45:23,798
They were waiting
for my ass.

700
00:45:23,876 --> 00:45:25,810
They knew about the money.

701
00:45:25,878 --> 00:45:29,439
- They even knew the exact amount.
- What did they want to know?

702
00:45:29,515 --> 00:45:32,450
Who gave me the money
and who I was givin' it to.

703
00:45:32,518 --> 00:45:36,079
They found this guy in the trunk
of a car with his head blown off.

704
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:38,487
They said it was him
who told them about me.

705
00:45:38,558 --> 00:45:42,688
That would be...
Beaumont Livingston.

706
00:45:42,762 --> 00:45:45,356
How do you know
about him?

707
00:45:45,431 --> 00:45:49,162
I wrote him on Monday.
They found him dead on Tuesday.

708
00:45:49,669 --> 00:45:52,001
Ordell pick up his bond?

709
00:45:54,073 --> 00:45:57,941
Same as you- $10,000.

710
00:45:58,244 --> 00:46:01,702
# Back about 18 and25 #

711
00:46:01,781 --> 00:46:05,376
# I left Tennessee
very much alive #

712
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:07,783
- Thanks for the drink.
- You're welcome.

713
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:10,686
- The legal advice and the ride.
- You bet.

714
00:46:10,756 --> 00:46:15,318
- # On a Tennessee stud #
- Good luck. We'll be in touch.

715
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:19,728
# Had some trouble
with my sweetheart's pa #

716
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:23,291
# One of her brothers
was a bad outlaw #

717
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:26,805
# I wrote a letter
to my Uncle Fudd #

718
00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:31,070
# And I rode away
on a Tennessee stud #

719
00:46:31,143 --> 00:46:35,079
# The Tennessee stud
was long and lean #

720
00:46:35,147 --> 00:46:39,948
# The color of the sun
and his eyes were green #

721
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:42,817
# He had the nerve
and he had the blood #

722
00:46:42,888 --> 00:46:45,652
# There never was a horse like the- ##

723
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,894
How ya doin',
Miss Jackie?

724
00:47:26,966 --> 00:47:28,934
Come on in.

725
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:41,076
- Do you got some booze?
- I got some vodka in the freezer.

726
00:47:41,147 --> 00:47:43,741
Got some O.J.?

727
00:47:43,816 --> 00:47:46,182
Why don't you be
a good hostess...

728
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:49,187
and hook a brother up
a screwdriver?

729
00:47:49,255 --> 00:47:51,189
Sure.

730
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,921
Well?

731
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,696
- You gonna thank me?
- For what?

732
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:06,704
Who the hell do you think
got your ass out of jail?

733
00:48:06,772 --> 00:48:10,765
The same guy that put my ass in jail.
Thanks a lot.

734
00:48:10,843 --> 00:48:15,542
Hey, you got caught with blow.
That's your business.

735
00:48:15,614 --> 00:48:18,515
- It wasn't mine.
- What?

736
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:22,281
Oh, shit.

737
00:48:22,355 --> 00:48:25,552
I bet that was that present
Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.

738
00:48:25,624 --> 00:48:29,720
Yeah. If you didn't put it in there,
he must have.

739
00:48:29,795 --> 00:48:33,026
Damn. That shit wasn't called for.
Baby, I'm sorry.

740
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:37,627
Bet they asked you a whole shit load
of questions about it, huh?

741
00:48:37,703 --> 00:48:41,730
And all that money,
where it came from.

742
00:48:41,807 --> 00:48:45,402
Probably asked you who you
was bringing' it to too.

743
00:48:46,979 --> 00:48:48,913
They asked.

744
00:48:50,149 --> 00:48:52,140
And you said?

745
00:48:52,218 --> 00:48:56,484
"I want to talk to my lawyer. "

746
00:48:56,555 --> 00:49:00,685
You sure you didn't get nervous
and kind of let somethin' slip?

747
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,354
I mean, if you did,
I ain't mad at you.

748
00:49:03,429 --> 00:49:05,363
I just gotta know.

749
00:49:07,032 --> 00:49:10,024
You ain't asking
the right questions.

750
00:49:17,476 --> 00:49:20,877
You should be asking
why they picked me up.

751
00:49:22,314 --> 00:49:25,283
They were waiting for me.

752
00:49:25,351 --> 00:49:28,946
They knew about the money
and they knew the exact amount.

753
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:33,958
- They tell you how they happen
to come by this information?

754
00:49:36,695 --> 00:49:38,959
Beaumont Livingston?

755
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:42,660
I knew it.
I knew it.

756
00:49:42,735 --> 00:49:45,568
They even asked me
if I knew Mr. Walker.

757
00:49:45,638 --> 00:49:47,572
Yeah?

758
00:49:48,808 --> 00:49:51,743
I didn't tell them
anything about him.

759
00:49:51,811 --> 00:49:54,143
My name come up?

760
00:49:56,649 --> 00:50:00,642
You ain't said nothin' about me?

761
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,246
Ah, that's mighty noble
of you.

762
00:50:04,323 --> 00:50:09,022
They tell you what happened
to this Beaumont fellow?

763
00:50:09,094 --> 00:50:11,426
Yeah, they told me.

764
00:50:11,497 --> 00:50:13,431
Yeah.

765
00:50:13,499 --> 00:50:16,866
Somebody must have been
real mad at old Beaumont.

766
00:50:16,936 --> 00:50:21,873
Or else they pretty scared about what
he might say to keep from doing time.

767
00:50:23,476 --> 00:50:27,913
Yeah, I bet they asked you
a whole shitload of questions.

768
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,916
And you ain't givin' them
no kind of answer?

769
00:50:31,984 --> 00:50:36,114
- Mm-mm.
- You scared of me?

770
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:41,717
You got any reason
to be nervous around me?

771
00:50:45,397 --> 00:50:47,422
Is that what
I think it is?

772
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,060
What do you think it is?

773
00:50:50,135 --> 00:50:53,571
- I think it's a gun pressed up against my dick.
- Well, you thought right.

774
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:56,574
Now, take your hands
from around my throat,

775
00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:58,576
nigger.

776
00:51:00,145 --> 00:51:02,739
- What the hell's wrong with you, Jackie?
- Shut the fuck up.

777
00:51:02,815 --> 00:51:05,909
Don't you move. Oh, what is this?
What the fuck is this?

778
00:51:05,985 --> 00:51:09,352
Hey, that ain't got nothing to do
with you. I carry that all the time.

779
00:51:09,421 --> 00:51:11,412
You been talking
to them police too much.

780
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:14,084
- The police didn't try and strangle my ass.
- Come on, girl.

781
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:16,593
- I was just playing with you.
- I ain't playing with you.

782
00:51:16,662 --> 00:51:20,098
I'm gonna unload both of these motherfuckers
if you don't do what I tell you to do.

783
00:51:20,165 --> 00:51:22,429
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Jackie, stop acting crazy.

784
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:25,470
- Do you understand what the fuck I'm saying?
- Yeah, woman. Damn!

785
00:51:25,538 --> 00:51:27,938
Now, sit your ass down
on that sofa.

786
00:51:28,007 --> 00:51:32,603
See? Police start fuckin' with your
mind, start pittin' black against black.

787
00:51:32,678 --> 00:51:36,944
- That's how they do. They been doing
this since- - Shut your raggedy ass up.

788
00:51:37,016 --> 00:51:39,576
Sit the fuck down!

789
00:51:39,652 --> 00:51:42,917
And put your hands behind your head.

790
00:51:42,988 --> 00:51:47,448
- This is gettin' silly now.
- Oh, silly? You want to see some motherfuckin' silly?

791
00:51:47,526 --> 00:51:50,791
If I have to tell you to shut up
one more time, I'm gonna shut you up.

792
00:51:50,863 --> 00:51:54,959
- I just came over here to talk to you.
- To talk?

793
00:51:55,034 --> 00:51:59,403
The way I see it, you and me got one
motherfucking thing to talk about.

794
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:01,735
One thing,

795
00:52:01,807 --> 00:52:04,867
and that's what you
are wiling to do for me.

796
00:52:04,944 --> 00:52:08,641
- I can get you a lawyer.
- No, let's be realistic.

797
00:52:08,714 --> 00:52:11,911
Now, sooner or later they're gonna
get around to offering me a plea deal,

798
00:52:11,984 --> 00:52:13,918
and you know that.

799
00:52:13,986 --> 00:52:16,682
- That's why you came here to kill me.
- I ain't come over to kill you.

800
00:52:16,755 --> 00:52:19,087
No, that's all right.
It's okay.

801
00:52:19,158 --> 00:52:21,592
Now, I forgive you.

802
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,686
Now, let's say,
if I tell on you,

803
00:52:24,763 --> 00:52:26,697
I walk.

804
00:52:26,765 --> 00:52:29,427
If I don't, I'll go to jail.

805
00:52:29,501 --> 00:52:32,265
I want $100,000...

806
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:34,568
in an escrow account
in my name...

807
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,303
if I'm convicted up to a year
or put on probation.

808
00:52:38,377 --> 00:52:41,278
Now, if I have to do
more than a year,

809
00:52:41,347 --> 00:52:44,748
you pay another $100,000.

810
00:52:49,622 --> 00:52:51,647
I can do that.

811
00:52:51,724 --> 00:52:55,160
- You know I got that problem.
All my money is- - In Mexico.

812
00:52:55,227 --> 00:52:58,993
- Right.
- Well, I been thinking about that too.

813
00:52:59,064 --> 00:53:01,259
I got me an idea.

814
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:07,896
Let me hear that.
We friends again.

815
00:53:07,973 --> 00:53:11,272
Why don't you point that
motherfucking gun somewhere else?

816
00:53:16,882 --> 00:53:21,080
- I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
- All right.

817
00:53:38,837 --> 00:53:41,305
You want your gun back?

818
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:44,308
Come in and I'll
get it for you.

819
00:54:06,131 --> 00:54:08,895
Max, look,
I am so sorry about this.

820
00:54:08,967 --> 00:54:13,063
You know, I was afraid to ask to borrow
it, 'cause I was afraid you would say no.

821
00:54:13,138 --> 00:54:15,470
I mean, you'd have to.

822
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:18,567
Would you like
some coffee?

823
00:54:18,644 --> 00:54:21,238
- If you're having some.
- I am. Come on in.

824
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:23,804
Why don't you make
yourself at home?

825
00:54:23,882 --> 00:54:26,442
Just, you know,
have a seat.

826
00:54:26,518 --> 00:54:29,248
Did you get a chance
to use it?

827
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:32,154
I felt a lot safer
having it.

828
00:54:32,224 --> 00:54:35,387
Oh, the milk went bad
while I was in jail.

829
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:38,828
- Black's fine.
- Cool.

830
00:54:38,897 --> 00:54:41,923
Would you, uh, care to
hang on to it for a while?

831
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,458
It wouldn't be legal, but if it
makes you feel better, I guess-

832
00:54:45,537 --> 00:54:47,971
Well, thanks.
I got one now.

833
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,804
- You went out this morning
and bought a gun?

834
00:54:50,876 --> 00:54:54,573
- What? I didn't hear you.
- You went out this morning and bought a gun?

835
00:54:54,646 --> 00:54:59,208
Well, let's say
I got one now, okay?

836
00:54:59,284 --> 00:55:02,219
- Somebody loan it to you?
- Yeah.

837
00:55:06,158 --> 00:55:09,218
All right!
We're on.

838
00:55:09,294 --> 00:55:13,128
It might be a little black.
Would you like to hear some music?

839
00:55:13,198 --> 00:55:15,166
Sure.

840
00:55:15,234 --> 00:55:17,168
Cool.

841
00:55:17,236 --> 00:55:20,171
You know, I couldn't wait
to get home last night...

842
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:22,799
and wash the jail
outta my hair.

843
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:25,867
- It looks nice.
- Thanks.

844
00:55:27,312 --> 00:55:30,247
You never got into
the whole CD revolution?

845
00:55:30,315 --> 00:55:33,773
Oh, I got a few, but I can't afford
to start all over again.

846
00:55:33,852 --> 00:55:36,787
I mean, I've invested too much
time and money...

847
00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:38,846
in my albums.

848
00:55:38,924 --> 00:55:41,256
Yeah, but you can't get
new stuff on records.

849
00:55:42,494 --> 00:55:45,361
I don't get new stuff
that often.

850
00:56:01,847 --> 00:56:05,180
# I gave my heart
and soul #

851
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:08,549
# To you, girl #

852
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,317
# Didn't I do it, baby #

853
00:56:12,391 --> 00:56:14,825
- # Didn't I do it, baby #
- It's pretty.

854
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:21,332
- Who is this?
- The Delfonics.

855
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,563
- # Didn't I do it, baby #
- It's nice.

856
00:56:24,636 --> 00:56:28,003
# Didn't I do it, baby #

857
00:56:28,073 --> 00:56:31,804
I called in sick today. As far as
the airline knows, I'm still available.

858
00:56:31,877 --> 00:56:35,643
- Are you?
- I don't know. I'm gonna go in and talk with Nicolet and Dargas today.

859
00:56:35,714 --> 00:56:39,548
I'm going to do what you suggested-
offer to help and see what happens.

860
00:56:39,618 --> 00:56:43,554
What I meant was to have a lawyer
do the negotiating for you.

861
00:56:43,622 --> 00:56:46,819
No, I want to talk to them first.
I know more now about Ordell's money.

862
00:56:46,892 --> 00:56:51,022
Well, if it's the A.T.F. guy that wants
you, that'll only interest him up to a point.

863
00:56:51,096 --> 00:56:53,690
I know, but it's
a lot of money.

864
00:56:53,765 --> 00:56:57,701
It's a half a million dollars
all in Cabo, and more coming in.

865
00:56:57,769 --> 00:57:01,865
- How'd you find that out?
- Ordell told me last night.

866
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,432
- He called?
- He came by.

867
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:09,173
- What'd you do?
- We talked.

868
00:57:09,248 --> 00:57:11,512
Do you think
he still trusts you?

869
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:15,041
He had his doubts at first,
but he's always trusted me.

870
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,988
And he wants to believe more than
anything else that he still can.

871
00:57:21,526 --> 00:57:23,824
- Why?
- Because he needs my ass.

872
00:57:23,896 --> 00:57:28,128
Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit
over there in Cabo. You want some sugar?

873
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,193
No, thank you. There's gotta be
other ways of getting it out.

874
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:35,365
Maybe, but I'm the only one
he's ever used.

875
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,375
I mean, he can't use his other people.
They're crooks.

876
00:57:38,443 --> 00:57:41,310
I mean, he might try to...
bring the money in himself,

877
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,871
but he ain't gonna wanna
stand in no customs lines.

878
00:57:43,949 --> 00:57:47,680
So, either he recruits another Cabo
stewardess or he continues to trust me.

879
00:57:47,753 --> 00:57:50,381
And I made him feel
like he still can.

880
00:57:50,455 --> 00:57:53,356
Are you gonna offer
to set him up?

881
00:57:53,425 --> 00:57:56,917
Yeah, if I get off.
Otherwise, fuck 'em.

882
00:57:56,995 --> 00:58:00,863
It's very possible that
Ordell's killed somebody.

883
00:58:00,933 --> 00:58:03,401
Do you realize that?

884
00:58:03,468 --> 00:58:07,700
Well, I ain't going back to jail and I
ain't doing that probation thing again.

885
00:58:14,046 --> 00:58:17,538
Max, how do you feel
about getting old?

886
00:58:17,616 --> 00:58:20,949
You're not old.
You look great.

887
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:24,614
No, I'm asking you
how do you feel about getting old.

888
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:29,024
- Doesn't it bother you?
- It's not really something I think about.

889
00:58:29,094 --> 00:58:33,360
- Really?
- I guess I got sensitive about my hair a few years ago.

890
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:36,731
It started falling out,
so I did something about it.

891
00:58:36,802 --> 00:58:38,793
How'd you feel about that?

892
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:41,805
I feel fine with it.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it.

893
00:58:41,873 --> 00:58:45,673
I did it to feel better about myself,
and, you know, I do.

894
00:58:45,744 --> 00:58:49,305
I look in the mirror.
Looks like me.

895
00:58:49,381 --> 00:58:52,248
Yeah, but it's
different for men.

896
00:58:52,317 --> 00:58:56,185
You know, I can't really feel
too sorry for you in this department.

897
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:58,779
I bet that,
except for possibly an afro,

898
00:58:58,857 --> 00:59:01,951
you look exactly
the way you did at 29.

899
00:59:03,595 --> 00:59:06,325
Well, my ass
ain't the same.

900
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:08,832
Bigger?

901
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,925
Yeah.

902
00:59:11,003 --> 00:59:13,267
Ain't nothing wrong
with that.

903
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,476
Something else worry you?

904
00:59:21,613 --> 00:59:25,811
I always feel like I'm starting over.

905
00:59:25,884 --> 00:59:29,843
- How many bonds you said you wrote?
- 15,000.

906
00:59:31,023 --> 00:59:33,457
- Is that a lot?
- That's plenty.

907
00:59:33,525 --> 00:59:35,891
# Pass them by #

908
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:38,725
Well, I've flown
over seven million miles,

909
00:59:38,797 --> 00:59:42,062
and I've been waiting
on people for 20 years.

910
00:59:42,134 --> 00:59:45,661
Then after my bust, the best job
I could get was with Cabo Air,

911
00:59:45,737 --> 00:59:49,400
which is the worst job
you can get in this industry.

912
00:59:49,474 --> 00:59:51,908
You know I make
16,000 a year,

913
00:59:51,977 --> 00:59:55,413
plus retirement benefits
that ain't worth a damn?

914
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,075
And with this arrest hanging over
my head, Max, I'm scared.

915
00:59:59,151 --> 01:00:01,915
And if I lose this job,
I gotta start all over again,

916
01:00:01,987 --> 01:00:04,251
and I ain't got nothing
to start over with.

917
01:00:04,322 --> 01:00:07,450
I'll be stuck
with whatever I can get.

918
01:00:07,526 --> 01:00:09,926
# Oh, baby, please now #

919
01:00:09,995 --> 01:00:13,021
And that shit is
more scary than Ordell.

920
01:00:13,098 --> 01:00:15,362
# La, la, la means #

921
01:00:15,434 --> 01:00:17,902
# I love you ##

922
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:24,272
- Let's go.
- You don't have to- Ow!

923
01:00:24,342 --> 01:00:26,367
- Hey!
- Hey, great, you're here.

924
01:00:26,445 --> 01:00:28,879
- Yeah. Hey, Jackie. How're you doing?
- Fine.

925
01:00:28,947 --> 01:00:31,780
- Can I have a word outside with Ray for a minute?
- Sure. Take your time.

926
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,943
- I'll just be a minute.
- May I smoke?

927
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:36,954
Absolutely.

928
01:00:37,022 --> 01:00:39,354
- Dude, what up?
- She wants to make a deal.

929
01:00:39,424 --> 01:00:42,291
- Oh, yeah? Did she sound scared?
- She almost sounds scared.

930
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,521
- What's she want?
- She wants to go back to work.

931
01:00:44,596 --> 01:00:47,190
- Oh, yeah? So what's she going to give us?
- She hasn't gone into specifics.

932
01:00:47,265 --> 01:00:49,859
- She's been waiting for you to get here.
- She knows it's my case, right?

933
01:00:49,935 --> 01:00:52,062
Well, she hasn't said it,
but she's not stupid.

934
01:00:52,137 --> 01:00:55,504
- She knows it's you who wants her.
- Let's go. Cool.

935
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:59,805
Jackie, sorry to keep you waiting.

936
01:00:59,878 --> 01:01:03,075
Now, what can we do for you?

937
01:01:03,148 --> 01:01:06,845
I need permission to leave
the country so I can keep my job.

938
01:01:06,918 --> 01:01:10,547
- Yeah, we can look into that.
- I need it tomorrow.

939
01:01:10,622 --> 01:01:13,750
If I don't show up for
work tomorrow, I'm fired.

940
01:01:13,825 --> 01:01:16,316
Well, you know
what we want.

941
01:01:16,394 --> 01:01:18,692
If I'm working,
I can help you.

942
01:01:18,763 --> 01:01:21,231
Help us do what, Jackie?

943
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:24,735
- Help you get Ordell Robbie.
- So now, you do know him.

944
01:01:24,803 --> 01:01:26,737
You never asked
if I did or not.

945
01:01:26,805 --> 01:01:29,399
- So you're telling us now that you do know him.
- Of course I do.

946
01:01:29,474 --> 01:01:32,238
- I deliver money for him.
- No shit?

947
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:36,246
- You know how he makes his money?
- He sells guns.

948
01:01:36,314 --> 01:01:38,748
- You ever see him sell a gun?
- No.

949
01:01:38,817 --> 01:01:41,183
- Then how do you know he sells guns?
- He told me.

950
01:01:41,253 --> 01:01:44,450
Besides, why else would
a A.T.F. man be after him?

951
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:52,023
Well, how can
you help us?

952
01:01:52,097 --> 01:01:56,761
I'll do anything I can to help you
get his ass, short of wearing a wire.

953
01:01:56,835 --> 01:02:00,032
And in return for my help, I need permission
to leave the country, and immunity.

954
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:03,131
You don't want much,
do you?

955
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:05,472
Can you do it or not?

956
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,212
You know, I mean-

957
01:02:11,283 --> 01:02:14,218
It's possible.

958
01:02:14,386 --> 01:02:16,115
You're going to hear a guy
beg for his life, lady,

959
01:02:16,188 --> 01:02:18,622
'cause he betrayed
Nani Vitali.

960
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,555
Read the paper.

961
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:23,617
Read it!

962
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,692
Nani Vitali, a dangerous criminal.

963
01:02:27,766 --> 01:02:29,791
He's already killed
two people.

964
01:02:29,868 --> 01:02:33,565
- You know what he's known as?
The Mad Dog Murderer.

965
01:02:35,874 --> 01:02:38,240
- Hey, girl.
- Hola!

966
01:02:40,779 --> 01:02:44,681
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Looks like
somebody got some new clothes.

967
01:02:44,749 --> 01:02:47,013
Yeah, we did
a little shoppin'.

968
01:02:47,085 --> 01:02:50,020
You know, I couldn't have my boy
running around looking like no bum.

969
01:02:50,088 --> 01:02:52,682
- I don't know. I didn't look like a bum.
- Come on now, man.

970
01:02:52,757 --> 01:02:56,158
- You know you had that
Salvation Army thing going.

971
01:02:56,228 --> 01:03:00,961
Goddamn, girl. You getting high already?
It's just 2:00.

972
01:03:01,032 --> 01:03:03,364
It's that late?

973
01:03:03,435 --> 01:03:05,665
You smoke too much of that shit, that
shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.

974
01:03:05,737 --> 01:03:09,070
Not if your ambition
is to get high and watch TV.

975
01:03:11,776 --> 01:03:14,711
- Oh, y'all a couple of
Cheech and Chongs, huh?

976
01:03:14,779 --> 01:03:18,306
Oh, don't get up. I got it.

977
01:03:18,383 --> 01:03:20,351
Have a seat.

978
01:03:20,418 --> 01:03:24,149
Yo. Jackie!
What's up?

979
01:03:24,222 --> 01:03:26,713
No, Jackie,
I didn't get your message.

980
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:30,056
- I was gonna tell you!
- No, no, no, no, no, not on the phone.

981
01:03:30,128 --> 01:03:32,062
- Is she a good lay, huh?
- Here.

982
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:34,189
- You gotta make sure ain't nobody following you.
- It's ready to go?

983
01:03:34,266 --> 01:03:36,393
Yeah.
There's another bowl left.

984
01:03:36,468 --> 01:03:39,266
Let me go!

985
01:03:45,577 --> 01:03:48,341
Take your thumb off the carb.

986
01:03:48,413 --> 01:03:51,314
You mean, the sign that's
got the rooster on it?

987
01:03:54,419 --> 01:03:56,353
Shit.

988
01:03:57,656 --> 01:03:59,851
You okay?

989
01:03:59,924 --> 01:04:01,892
I'm just... gettin' old.

990
01:04:04,262 --> 01:04:08,665
I can't... smoke or laugh
now without coughing.

991
01:04:08,733 --> 01:04:11,429
Coughing's good.
It opens up the capillaries.

992
01:04:11,503 --> 01:04:15,200
You know, when you cough, you're
pulling air- or in this case, smoke-

993
01:04:15,273 --> 01:04:17,867
into parts of the lungs that
don't normally get used.

994
01:04:17,942 --> 01:04:20,570
And so, coughing's good.
It gets you higher.

995
01:04:20,645 --> 01:04:22,840
You definitely know
a lot about that.

996
01:04:22,914 --> 01:04:25,405
Look here, Louis, I got
to run out for a little while.

997
01:04:25,483 --> 01:04:27,917
So, since you like
getting high so much,

998
01:04:27,986 --> 01:04:30,420
why don't you hang out here with Mel,
watch a little TV?

999
01:04:30,488 --> 01:04:33,116
- Way ahead of you.
- See, I get high later on when I come back.

1000
01:04:33,191 --> 01:04:36,422
See, I get high at night when I
get through with all my business.

1001
01:04:36,494 --> 01:04:40,362
That Rutger Hauer?

1002
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,391
No, it's Helmut Berger.

1003
01:04:46,538 --> 01:04:49,905
- Why don't you walk me to the door, space girl?
- Okay.

1004
01:04:51,743 --> 01:04:55,270
- You know, I hope you don't mind hanging out with Louis.
- No problem.

1005
01:04:55,347 --> 01:04:58,282
Try not to tear his clothes off of him,
all right? They're new.

1006
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,511
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Ha, ha!

1007
01:05:00,585 --> 01:05:04,021
- Yo, Louis! Catch you later, man.
- Okay. Later.

1008
01:05:09,094 --> 01:05:12,188
Want a Metrix?

1009
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:14,731
Uh- Damn. Shit.

1010
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,858
What's a Metrix?

1011
01:05:16,935 --> 01:05:20,371
It's like this major meal that you drink
in a shake instead of having a big meal.

1012
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:25,876
- It's like a diet thing?
- No. It's what bodybuilders drink to, you know, beef up.

1013
01:05:25,944 --> 01:05:28,037
No, thanks.

1014
01:05:28,113 --> 01:05:30,638
Okay.

1015
01:05:33,351 --> 01:05:35,842
When was the last time
I saw you?

1016
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,354
Oh... six, seven years ago.

1017
01:05:38,423 --> 01:05:41,017
It doesn't seem
like that long ago.

1018
01:05:41,092 --> 01:05:44,823
It was that long ago.

1019
01:05:47,665 --> 01:05:51,226
- How old were you in this picture?
- Which one?

1020
01:05:51,302 --> 01:05:54,794
The roller disco picture.
This one.

1021
01:05:54,873 --> 01:05:57,137
Oh. Um, 14.

1022
01:05:57,208 --> 01:06:01,269
- You were 14 here?
- Yup.

1023
01:06:01,346 --> 01:06:04,144
Shit, man.
I thought you were at least 16.

1024
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:08,682
Well, I'm about the same height
now as I was then.

1025
01:06:09,988 --> 01:06:12,013
Bruno! Sanchez!

1026
01:06:28,907 --> 01:06:31,375
- That other picture, that green one?
- Yeah?

1027
01:06:31,443 --> 01:06:33,911
That was taken at that place
called Flippers.

1028
01:06:33,978 --> 01:06:36,310
Do you remember that? It was in
Hollywood. Were you in L.A. then?

1029
01:06:36,381 --> 01:06:38,440
- No.
- Where were you?

1030
01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:41,076
I was in Detroit.

1031
01:06:41,152 --> 01:06:43,052
With Ordell?

1032
01:06:43,121 --> 01:06:45,612
Yeah. We had done
some time already.

1033
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:48,921
Oh. Were you a...
disco guy?

1034
01:06:48,993 --> 01:06:51,655
Nah.

1035
01:06:51,729 --> 01:06:55,893
- Come on. Don't lie.
- No, I wasn't. I don't like to dance.

1036
01:06:55,967 --> 01:07:00,028
- Were you ever in one?
- I went to a few just to meet women, but...

1037
01:07:00,104 --> 01:07:04,006
it was so loud
and I didn't like to dance.

1038
01:07:04,075 --> 01:07:08,171
During that whole scene,
I just drank in bars usually.

1039
01:07:08,246 --> 01:07:11,511
So who didn't make the cut?

1040
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:15,110
- That's a picture of me in Japan.
- Whose arm is that?

1041
01:07:15,186 --> 01:07:18,019
Uh, that's the guy
that I lived with.

1042
01:07:18,089 --> 01:07:20,523
His name was Hi-Hiro-
Hiro- Hiroshi.

1043
01:07:20,592 --> 01:07:23,356
He must have made quite an impression.

1044
01:07:23,428 --> 01:07:27,023
If you count cheese.
I never got to know him really.

1045
01:07:27,098 --> 01:07:30,033
You know, I couldn't speak any Japanese,
and his English was terrible.

1046
01:07:30,101 --> 01:07:34,538
But what am I going to say? His English
was better than my Japanese, you know.

1047
01:07:34,606 --> 01:07:37,871
- That sounds like a problem.
- Not really.

1048
01:07:37,942 --> 01:07:40,467
You know, we didn't have that much
to say to each other anyway.

1049
01:07:40,545 --> 01:07:42,979
I never really got to know him,
but I knew enough to know...

1050
01:07:43,047 --> 01:07:45,811
that I wasn't
missing much, so-

1051
01:07:45,884 --> 01:07:48,318
Anyway, I keep that picture because,
of all the fucking time I was there,

1052
01:07:48,386 --> 01:07:50,911
that's the only picture
I've got of me in Japan.

1053
01:07:50,989 --> 01:07:53,116
- That's Japan.
- Oh. Yeah.

1054
01:07:53,191 --> 01:07:55,682
Well- Yeah, I can-
Yeah, it looks- I could tell.

1055
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,490
Wanna fuck?

1056
01:07:58,563 --> 01:08:00,656
Yeah.

1057
01:08:15,046 --> 01:08:17,810
That was fun.

1058
01:08:17,882 --> 01:08:20,851
Yeah.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.

1059
01:08:27,926 --> 01:08:30,986
Now we can catch up.

1060
01:08:31,062 --> 01:08:33,860
Yeah.

1061
01:08:36,768 --> 01:08:39,100
You got a beer?

1062
01:08:41,172 --> 01:08:43,606
Yeah, sure.
In the fridge.

1063
01:08:47,845 --> 01:08:51,440
# Uh, I mean, damn
Me and you forever hand in hand #

1064
01:08:51,516 --> 01:08:54,144
# I'm married to the firm, boo
You got to understand #

1065
01:08:54,218 --> 01:08:57,244
# I'll die for 'em, gimme a chair
and then I'll fry for 'em #

1066
01:08:57,322 --> 01:08:59,654
- # And if I got to take the stand Im a lie for 'em #
- # Lie for 'em #

1067
01:08:59,724 --> 01:09:01,715
- # It's me and you hand in hand #
- # Forever #

1068
01:09:01,793 --> 01:09:04,159
- # I'm married to the firm, boo You got to understand #
- # That we be #

1069
01:09:04,228 --> 01:09:07,061
# I'll die for 'em, gimme a chair
and then I'll fry for 'em #

1070
01:09:07,131 --> 01:09:09,998
- # And if I got to take the stand Im a lie for 'em #
- # Uhh, sugar ##

1071
01:09:32,323 --> 01:09:35,156
I'm going
to the bar, baby.

1072
01:09:35,226 --> 01:09:37,353
# Two people #

1073
01:09:37,428 --> 01:09:39,953
- Jackie Jack!
- Hey.

1074
01:09:40,031 --> 01:09:44,695
Damn! I'm gonna have to remember
this place. This is all right.

1075
01:09:44,769 --> 01:09:47,533
About two minutes from your crib,
ten minutes from the gig. Not bad.

1076
01:09:47,605 --> 01:09:50,540
- What's your drink, brother?
- Let me get a screwdriver, homie.

1077
01:09:50,608 --> 01:09:52,872
- How're you doing?
- Oh, I'm fine.

1078
01:09:52,944 --> 01:09:56,539
Yes, you are.

1079
01:09:56,614 --> 01:09:59,378
Damn! I bet you come
in here on a Saturday night,

1080
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:03,352
you need nigger repellant to keep
them motherfuckers off your ass.

1081
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:06,447
- Oh, I do okay.
- Bullshit, Jackie.

1082
01:10:06,524 --> 01:10:10,858
You're a fine motherfucker. I bet
you do a damn sight better than okay.

1083
01:10:10,928 --> 01:10:14,125
- You think anybody followed you?
- I don't think so.

1084
01:10:14,198 --> 01:10:17,190
But it don't matter, 'cause they
already know I'm meeting you.

1085
01:10:17,268 --> 01:10:19,532
- How the fuck they know that?
- I told them.

1086
01:10:19,604 --> 01:10:21,629
- You told-
- 3.25.

1087
01:10:21,706 --> 01:10:24,197
- Here. Keep it.
- Thank you, sir.

1088
01:10:24,275 --> 01:10:26,209
- You told 'em it's me?
- They already know it's you.

1089
01:10:26,277 --> 01:10:28,370
Goddamn, that don't mean
you got to confirm it.

1090
01:10:28,446 --> 01:10:30,710
Look, the only way they're going
to give me permission to fly...

1091
01:10:30,782 --> 01:10:34,479
is if I agree to help 'em, which is
what I have to appear to be doing.

1092
01:10:34,552 --> 01:10:37,885
So I might as well give them
somebody they already know-you.

1093
01:10:37,955 --> 01:10:39,820
You tell 'em
anything else?

1094
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:43,520
Yeah, you got a half a mill in Mexico
and you want me to bring it in.

1095
01:10:43,594 --> 01:10:46,722
- Goddamn- You told them all that?
- It's true, ain't it?

1096
01:10:46,798 --> 01:10:49,733
What the fuck that got
to do with anything?

1097
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:51,769
They know I'm
delivering for you.

1098
01:10:51,836 --> 01:10:54,532
I told 'em about the half mil.
They could give a fuck about it.

1099
01:10:54,605 --> 01:10:57,165
All they wanna do
is catch your ass with guns.

1100
01:10:57,241 --> 01:11:00,039
So I said, "Look, you want proof
he's getting paid for selling 'em?

1101
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:02,375
- Let me bring in the money. "
- And they said?

1102
01:11:02,447 --> 01:11:05,314
Yes.

1103
01:11:05,383 --> 01:11:09,114
Hey, what's the matter? I mean,
that's what we discussed last night.

1104
01:11:09,187 --> 01:11:13,055
This is just seeming kind of risky now,
you know. Fuck this.

1105
01:11:13,124 --> 01:11:15,854
Now, let me lay it all out
to you, okay?

1106
01:11:15,927 --> 01:11:18,862
I make two deliveries-
the first with 10,000.

1107
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:22,366
You know, like a dry run?
They watch it, see how it works.

1108
01:11:22,433 --> 01:11:24,867
Then the second delivery,
I come home with the half mil.

1109
01:11:25,136 --> 01:11:27,370
See, that's too much exposure.

1110
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:30,373
- Now, I ain't goin' nowhere near that money.
- You don't have to.

1111
01:11:30,441 --> 01:11:32,739
I told them you never
pick up the money yourself.

1112
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:36,075
You always send someone, and I never know who it is.

1113
01:11:36,147 --> 01:11:39,514
- That's a good idea.
- If you listen, it's a damn good idea.

1114
01:11:39,584 --> 01:11:42,519
Now, the first time I do it,
they're looking around,

1115
01:11:42,587 --> 01:11:45,021
they see me hand
the 10,000 to someone.

1116
01:11:45,089 --> 01:11:48,456
- Who?
- I don't know. A friend of yours.

1117
01:11:48,526 --> 01:11:51,620
- Like a woman?
- If you want.

1118
01:11:51,696 --> 01:11:54,358
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm thinking a woman.

1119
01:11:54,432 --> 01:11:57,026
Wait a minute.
If they're gonna let you go,

1120
01:11:57,101 --> 01:12:00,366
- how come we don't bring all the cash in the first time?
- 'Cause I don't trust 'em.

1121
01:12:00,438 --> 01:12:03,168
Now, the next trip,
when I bring in the half mils,

1122
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:06,108
it's gonna look like I'm doing
the same thing as I did before.

1123
01:12:06,177 --> 01:12:09,704
- But you don't?
- No. I hand it to someone else first.

1124
01:12:09,781 --> 01:12:12,215
Hmm.
And they follow the wrong one,

1125
01:12:12,283 --> 01:12:14,376
thinking she's bringing
the money to me.

1126
01:12:14,452 --> 01:12:17,979
- That's the idea.
- So, we gonna need two women.

1127
01:12:18,055 --> 01:12:20,523
- Can you cover that?
- Yeah.

1128
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:22,855
Yeah, I got
the women covered.

1129
01:12:22,927 --> 01:12:25,395
Where are you planning
on puling this off?

1130
01:12:25,463 --> 01:12:27,988
The Dell Amo Mal,
the food court.

1131
01:12:28,065 --> 01:12:31,000
And I suppose you see
a piece of this for yourself?

1132
01:12:31,068 --> 01:12:33,502
It's my plan.
We're in this together.

1133
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:36,404
Yeah, but it's my money
and I don't need no fuckin' partners.

1134
01:12:36,474 --> 01:12:38,908
I ain't your partner.
I'm your manager.

1135
01:12:38,976 --> 01:12:42,343
And I'm managing to get your money out
of Mexico, into America, in your hands,

1136
01:12:42,413 --> 01:12:44,847
and I'm managing to do it
all under the nose of the cops.

1137
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:47,817
So, therefore, I'm your manager,
and a manager gets 15%.

1138
01:12:47,885 --> 01:12:51,013
- No, a manager gets ten percent.
- No, that's an agent.

1139
01:12:51,088 --> 01:12:53,181
- I'm gonna give you ten.
- No. No.

1140
01:12:53,257 --> 01:12:55,919
A manager gets 15%,
agent gets 10.

1141
01:12:55,993 --> 01:12:57,927
I'm getting 15%,
all right?

1142
01:12:57,995 --> 01:13:00,623
All I'm gonna give you
is ten.

1143
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:03,132
And the same deal
as before.

1144
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:10,599
I can do that.

1145
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:13,537
So he says, "Fuck that, "
and moves over into guns.

1146
01:13:13,611 --> 01:13:16,546
See, you can sell guns wherever there's
a demand, and nobody gives a shit.

1147
01:13:16,614 --> 01:13:19,242
He's acting like he's this
big international arms dealer...

1148
01:13:19,317 --> 01:13:23,310
when, come on, face it, the only people
he ever sold to were dopers.

1149
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:28,218
Well, he seems
to be making out.

1150
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:31,056
- Is it dead?
- Yeah.

1151
01:13:31,128 --> 01:13:33,722
Yeah, well...
so far, he is.

1152
01:13:33,798 --> 01:13:36,733
But you got to admit,
he's not too bright.

1153
01:13:36,801 --> 01:13:39,793
Oh... I wouldn't go
so far as to say that.

1154
01:13:40,972 --> 01:13:43,338
He moves his lips
when he reads.

1155
01:13:43,407 --> 01:13:45,500
What does that
tell you?

1156
01:13:45,576 --> 01:13:48,670
Let's say that he's
streetwise, you know.

1157
01:13:48,746 --> 01:13:52,443
We'll give him that.
He's still a fuckup.

1158
01:14:04,195 --> 01:14:07,961
He killed a man who
worked for him the other day.

1159
01:14:08,032 --> 01:14:10,296
Well-

1160
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:14,864
So, what are you trying
to tell me?

1161
01:14:14,939 --> 01:14:17,203
That I should get
out of here?

1162
01:14:17,275 --> 01:14:19,709
That's not what
I'm saying at al.

1163
01:14:19,777 --> 01:14:23,713
You know where he went?
He went to go meet that stewardess.

1164
01:14:25,082 --> 01:14:27,607
- Does that bother you?
- Please!

1165
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:32,453
Well, I don't know.
You live with him, so-

1166
01:14:32,523 --> 01:14:36,118
No, I live here.
He just drops in and out.

1167
01:14:36,193 --> 01:14:39,788
Did he tell you about that half million
he's got down in Mexico?

1168
01:14:39,994 --> 01:14:42,662
Of course he did. He tells
anybody whos gonna listen.

1169
01:14:42,733 --> 01:14:45,167
Well, that's what him
and that stewardess are doing.

1170
01:14:45,236 --> 01:14:48,672
They're scheming on how
they can get that money over here.

1171
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:51,333
And your point is?

1172
01:14:51,409 --> 01:14:56,244
Let him and the stewardess get
the money over here,

1173
01:14:56,314 --> 01:14:59,579
and then just
take it from them.

1174
01:15:03,955 --> 01:15:07,823
# A man we passed
just tried to stare me down #

1175
01:15:07,892 --> 01:15:10,918
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, man.

1176
01:15:10,995 --> 01:15:15,398
- You ain't gonna get serious while we're in here chilling?
- No. It's just about Melanie.

1177
01:15:15,466 --> 01:15:18,196
You know what?
I'm really sorry about that, man,

1178
01:15:18,269 --> 01:15:20,703
but I had to be somewhere
all of a sudden.

1179
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:23,433
I figured, well, shit,
Louis ain't had no pussy for a while.

1180
01:15:23,507 --> 01:15:26,601
So I thought, let him
kick it here with Mel.

1181
01:15:28,746 --> 01:15:31,510
# The things that you do #

1182
01:15:31,582 --> 01:15:33,846
So, what she say?

1183
01:15:33,918 --> 01:15:36,887
She didn't have to say shit.
I know Melanie.

1184
01:15:36,954 --> 01:15:40,151
That bitch is gonna be fucking you
two minutes after I'm out the door.

1185
01:15:40,224 --> 01:15:42,988
Melanie really good about
throwing a fuck a nigger's way.

1186
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:46,826
I mean, she ain't no damn good at it,
but she likes to fuck.

1187
01:15:46,897 --> 01:15:49,832
- Oh, so she aint your girlfriend?
- Is that what you thought?

1188
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:52,835
- No, I wasn't sure. I didn't know.
- But you fucked her anyway?

1189
01:15:52,903 --> 01:15:54,837
Well...

1190
01:15:54,905 --> 01:15:58,341
the "not your girlfriend" part
I felt more about.

1191
01:15:58,409 --> 01:16:01,378
Oh. Well, I hope you felt
appropriately guilty afterwards.

1192
01:16:01,445 --> 01:16:03,572
Afterwards, I did.

1193
01:16:08,586 --> 01:16:10,850
Oh, oh, shit.

1194
01:16:13,691 --> 01:16:17,354
But, um- But, like,
you know, what is she to you?

1195
01:16:17,428 --> 01:16:20,192
You know, she's just one of
the bitches I got set up.

1196
01:16:20,264 --> 01:16:22,698
I got Mel
over in Hermosa Beach,

1197
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:25,600
and I rent this little place for Simone
over in Compton where youre staying,

1198
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:30,106
and about four blocks away I got this young
19-year-old country girl named Sheronda.

1199
01:16:30,174 --> 01:16:32,870
I found her on the bus stop
two days out of Georgia,

1200
01:16:32,943 --> 01:16:35,207
barefoot,
country as a chicken coop.

1201
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:38,214
Took her to my place in Compton,
told her it was Hollywood.

1202
01:16:38,282 --> 01:16:41,149
- She believed you?
- Hell, yeah.

1203
01:16:41,218 --> 01:16:43,982
To her dumb country ass,
Compton is Hollywood.

1204
01:16:44,055 --> 01:16:46,387
Closest she ever been,
anyway.

1205
01:16:46,457 --> 01:16:49,324
But you trust Melanie
around your business?

1206
01:16:52,096 --> 01:16:55,031
She trying to play your ass
against me, ain't she?

1207
01:16:55,099 --> 01:16:57,863
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. See, I knew it.

1208
01:16:57,935 --> 01:17:02,201
I knew it. I knew it! See, you didn't
have to say nothing. I know that bitch.

1209
01:17:02,273 --> 01:17:06,004
I don't understand why you keep someone around
your business and you can't even trust 'em.

1210
01:17:06,077 --> 01:17:08,739
I ain't gotta trust her.
I know her.

1211
01:17:08,813 --> 01:17:11,941
I don't know
what that means, man.

1212
01:17:12,016 --> 01:17:14,507
Well, you can't
trust Melanie,

1213
01:17:14,585 --> 01:17:18,021
but you can always trust
Melanie to be Melanie.

1214
01:17:18,089 --> 01:17:21,616
Well, I don't understand
why you keep her the fuck around.

1215
01:17:21,692 --> 01:17:24,820
I told you, man.
She's my fine little surfer girl.

1216
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:27,489
You know, she ain't pretty
as she used to be...

1217
01:17:27,565 --> 01:17:30,432
and she bitch a whole lot more
than she used to,

1218
01:17:30,501 --> 01:17:32,594
but she white.

1219
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:06,796
You have one message sent at 8:06 p. m.

1220
01:18:06,871 --> 01:18:09,339
Hi, Jackie. It's Max.

1221
01:18:09,406 --> 01:18:12,898
I was just calling to find out
how everything went today at A. T.F.

1222
01:18:12,977 --> 01:18:16,140
If you want to call me,
my home number is...

1223
01:18:16,213 --> 01:18:20,377
915-9302.

1224
01:18:20,451 --> 01:18:23,147
Or you can reach me
at my office, which is...

1225
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:26,587
313-3688.

1226
01:18:26,657 --> 01:18:29,091
It's on the card I gave you
when we first met.

1227
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:32,095
I don't know whether you still have it,
but it's on it.

1228
01:18:32,163 --> 01:18:34,597
Oh, let me give you
my beeper number.

1229
01:18:34,665 --> 01:18:39,261
It's 991- 1075,

1230
01:18:39,336 --> 01:18:43,329
then dial 6872.

1231
01:18:43,407 --> 01:18:46,808
Wait for a beep,
dial 59...

1232
01:18:46,877 --> 01:18:49,141
and hit the pound.

1233
01:18:49,213 --> 01:18:51,807
Um, okay, so I'll talk
to you later.

1234
01:18:51,882 --> 01:18:54,316
Hope everything's well. Bye-bye.

1235
01:18:54,385 --> 01:18:56,319
End of message.

1236
01:19:08,365 --> 01:19:11,391
Now, the money's gonna be in
a Dell Amo shopping bag, all right?

1237
01:19:11,468 --> 01:19:15,063
I get some food, sit down here in
the food court, then your girl comes in.

1238
01:19:15,139 --> 01:19:17,300
Did you find somebody yet?

1239
01:19:17,374 --> 01:19:19,308
- Who?
- What you care?

1240
01:19:19,376 --> 01:19:21,776
What I care is my ass
facing the penitentiary.

1241
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:24,405
- You send some hardheaded rock whore
up here and she- - Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1242
01:19:24,481 --> 01:19:28,440
She ain't gonna be no rock whore.
She's gonna be cool, promise.

1243
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:48,595
All right, so we straight, right?

1244
01:19:48,672 --> 01:19:51,368
I'm gonna roll up over here and
check out this shirt I was looking at.

1245
01:19:51,442 --> 01:19:54,934
- I'll catch you.
- Hey, don't forget your bags.

1246
01:20:17,534 --> 01:20:19,798
Shit!

1247
01:20:38,555 --> 01:20:40,819
Max! Max!

1248
01:20:42,459 --> 01:20:44,222
Hey.

1249
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:48,425
Well, hello.

1250
01:20:48,499 --> 01:20:52,094
- Hey, surprise.
- I walked right past you.

1251
01:20:52,169 --> 01:20:54,899
I know, ignoring me.
So, what are you up to?

1252
01:20:54,972 --> 01:20:57,805
- Just catching a movie.
- What'd you see?

1253
01:20:59,176 --> 01:21:02,475
What the fuck
is up with this shit?

1254
01:21:12,656 --> 01:21:15,887
- I called you last night.
- I know. I got your message.

1255
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:19,554
Ray wanted to have dinner with me so we can,
you know, talk about the sting we're plotting.

1256
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:22,292
That's what he calls it,
a sting.

1257
01:21:22,366 --> 01:21:24,994
He's been-
He's been really nice.

1258
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:28,534
You think he's got
a thing for you?

1259
01:21:28,605 --> 01:21:30,971
Maybe.

1260
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:36,104
But I'm thinking it's something more
like he wants the money for himself.

1261
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,876
Has he hinted around?

1262
01:21:38,949 --> 01:21:42,009
No. He just tries
to act cool.

1263
01:21:42,086 --> 01:21:45,021
You know, I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

1264
01:21:45,089 --> 01:21:47,990
He's just a young guy
having fun being a cop.

1265
01:21:48,058 --> 01:21:50,492
I know the type.
Trust me on this.

1266
01:21:50,561 --> 01:21:53,826
He's more interested in Ordell
than he is in the money.

1267
01:21:53,897 --> 01:21:57,128
If he does anything suspect, it'll be
cutting corners to get the conviction,

1268
01:21:57,201 --> 01:22:00,898
but he wouldn't walk off with the money:,
it's evidence.

1269
01:22:00,971 --> 01:22:03,997
- And what about you, Max?
- What?

1270
01:22:04,074 --> 01:22:06,167
If I was
in Nicolet's place?

1271
01:22:06,243 --> 01:22:09,406
No, I mean you right now,
not if you were somebody else.

1272
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:13,746
If I saw an opportunity to walk away with a
shopping bag full of money, would I take it?

1273
01:22:13,817 --> 01:22:17,844
You know where it came from. It's not
like it's somebody's life savings.

1274
01:22:17,921 --> 01:22:20,719
It wouldn't even be missed.

1275
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:23,988
Half a million dollars
will always be missed.

1276
01:22:24,061 --> 01:22:26,859
You're avoiding
the question, Max.

1277
01:22:28,065 --> 01:22:31,330
Okay, sure, I guess
I'd be tempted,

1278
01:22:31,402 --> 01:22:34,462
especially now since I'm getting out
of the bail bond business.

1279
01:22:34,538 --> 01:22:36,870
- Why?
- A lot of reasons.

1280
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:41,570
I guess the main one would be,
uh... I'm tired of it.

1281
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:48,009
When did you decide?

1282
01:22:48,085 --> 01:22:50,349
It's been
a long time coming,

1283
01:22:50,421 --> 01:22:52,855
but I finally
made up my mind.

1284
01:22:52,923 --> 01:22:55,983
I guess it was... Thursday.

1285
01:22:56,059 --> 01:22:58,152
Miss Brown?

1286
01:22:58,228 --> 01:23:02,130
- Yes?
- I'm Max Cherry, your bail bondsman.

1287
01:23:02,199 --> 01:23:05,066
The night you got me
out of jail?

1288
01:23:05,135 --> 01:23:08,070
Yeah.
I went to pick up this guy.

1289
01:23:08,138 --> 01:23:11,107
I hear he's staying
at a house, and, uh...

1290
01:23:11,175 --> 01:23:13,405
I sneak in
and I'm waiting for him-

1291
01:23:13,477 --> 01:23:17,880
Wait a minute. After we were together,
you snuck into a guy's house?

1292
01:23:17,948 --> 01:23:22,385
Yeah. I went back to my office
and found out that you took my gun,

1293
01:23:22,453 --> 01:23:25,047
got another gun
and the stun gun,

1294
01:23:25,122 --> 01:23:28,148
went to this guy's house in Ell Monte
and waited for him to come home.

1295
01:23:28,225 --> 01:23:31,388
- What do you do when he comes home?
- Shoot him with the stun gun.

1296
01:23:31,462 --> 01:23:34,898
While he's incapacitated,
you cuff him and take him to County.

1297
01:23:34,965 --> 01:23:36,933
- You do that?
- It's my job.

1298
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,560
- Did you do that that night?
- Well, the guy never came home.

1299
01:23:39,636 --> 01:23:43,629
But I'm sitting on his couch
in the dark holding my stun gun.

1300
01:23:43,707 --> 01:23:47,006
The whole house
smells of cat pee.

1301
01:23:47,077 --> 01:23:50,342
And after a couple of hours,
I think,

1302
01:23:50,414 --> 01:23:52,678
"What am I doing this?

1303
01:23:52,749 --> 01:23:55,582
It's 19 years
of this shit. "

1304
01:23:55,652 --> 01:23:59,679
And I make up my mind.
That's it.

1305
01:23:59,756 --> 01:24:03,351
I'm not sure you answered
my question, Max.

1306
01:24:03,427 --> 01:24:05,224
Which one?

1307
01:24:05,295 --> 01:24:09,026
If you had the chance,
unemployed now,

1308
01:24:09,099 --> 01:24:13,001
to walk away
with a half million dollars,

1309
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:15,504
would you take it?

1310
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:38,090
We gotta stop
meeting like this.

1311
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:42,326
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

1312
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:45,493
- Bet you're happy to be working again.
- Yeah.

1313
01:24:45,569 --> 01:24:48,060
This is A.T.F. Agent
Ray Nicolet.

1314
01:24:48,138 --> 01:24:50,402
Jackie Brown,
Ordell Robbie.

1315
01:24:50,474 --> 01:24:52,942
Money exchange,
trial run.

1316
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:56,070
Time is 3:07,

1317
01:24:56,146 --> 01:24:59,240
July 1, 1995.

1318
01:24:59,316 --> 01:25:01,807
Location is a parking
structure at LAX,

1319
01:25:01,885 --> 01:25:04,183
row "F '.'
parking structure "D."

1320
01:25:04,254 --> 01:25:06,518
- What are you doing?
- Recording all this.

1321
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:09,184
- I thought you were going to let this one go through.
- We are. Don't worry about it.

1322
01:25:09,259 --> 01:25:11,693
Every bit of this
goes in my report.

1323
01:25:11,762 --> 01:25:14,196
The subject is carrying
a flight bag.

1324
01:25:14,264 --> 01:25:18,633
I am now removing from the flight
bag a manila envelope.

1325
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:22,365
The envelope contains currency.

1326
01:25:24,841 --> 01:25:27,105
All the same denomination?

1327
01:25:27,177 --> 01:25:29,168
One-hundred-dollar bills.

1328
01:25:29,246 --> 01:25:31,714
Okay, I'm now
counting it.

1329
01:25:31,782 --> 01:25:35,115
- What time do you have to be there?
- 4:30. I'm meeting a woman.

1330
01:25:36,787 --> 01:25:39,381
- What's her name?
- He wouldn't say.

1331
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:42,983
- You gonna follow her?
- When she leaves, somebody'll be on her.

1332
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,654
- You're not gonna stop her?
- No, not this time.

1333
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:49,495
Okay.
The total amount of cash...

1334
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:54,230
in the manila envelope
is $10,000, right?

1335
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:58,138
The subject is delivering
the currency in a-

1336
01:25:58,208 --> 01:26:03,840
Dell Amo Fashion Center bag.

1337
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:07,611
- The bag is, uh... purple-
- It's white.

1338
01:26:07,684 --> 01:26:09,675
- Huh? White.
- It's white.

1339
01:26:09,753 --> 01:26:11,687
- Fine, the bag's white-
- With pink lettering.

1340
01:26:11,755 --> 01:26:13,689
- Purp-
- Image is purple.

1341
01:26:13,757 --> 01:26:15,725
- Lettering's pink.
- Fine-

1342
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:18,522
Okay, the bag's white. It's got purple
on it, and the lettering's pink.

1343
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:21,223
- Right. - And a really
good-looking woman on the cover.

1344
01:26:21,298 --> 01:26:23,232
Okay. There you go.

1345
01:27:13,717 --> 01:27:18,051
- This seat taken?
- No. Have a seat.

1346
01:27:24,428 --> 01:27:27,158
- You're hungry.
- Yes'm.

1347
01:27:28,765 --> 01:27:32,360
Put the bag on the floor, okay?
Under the table, next to mine.

1348
01:27:39,342 --> 01:27:42,743
And then when I leave-
Well, you know.

1349
01:27:44,114 --> 01:27:46,082
So, what's your name?

1350
01:27:47,551 --> 01:27:49,485
Sheronda.

1351
01:27:49,553 --> 01:27:52,078
Sheronda,
that's a nice name.

1352
01:27:54,758 --> 01:27:57,556
Sheronda, go ahead.
You can eat.

1353
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:10,237
Well, Sheronda,
it was nice talking to you.

1354
01:28:27,657 --> 01:28:31,821
All right. Ill be back.
I'll check the bag. Stay here.

1355
01:28:35,999 --> 01:28:39,526
Max, you said it yourself.
Ray wants Ordell.

1356
01:28:39,603 --> 01:28:42,367
He doesn't give a shit
about the money.

1357
01:28:42,439 --> 01:28:44,737
The money won't convict him.
Guns will.

1358
01:28:44,808 --> 01:28:47,140
You're rationalizing.

1359
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:50,304
Well, that's what you do to go
through with the shit you start.

1360
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:52,314
You rationalize.

1361
01:28:52,382 --> 01:28:55,874
I can do it, Max.
I know I can.

1362
01:28:55,952 --> 01:28:58,978
I just can't do it
without you.

1363
01:29:10,867 --> 01:29:13,131
It's cool.

1364
01:29:18,208 --> 01:29:22,269
Excuse me, baby.
Uh, do you know what time it is?

1365
01:29:22,345 --> 01:29:25,803
No, ma'am. I ain't got no watch.

1366
01:31:06,149 --> 01:31:08,777
It could work.

1367
01:31:08,852 --> 01:31:11,548
If she handles
the cops right,

1368
01:31:11,621 --> 01:31:13,680
it could work.

1369
01:31:15,425 --> 01:31:18,121
# I gave my heart
and soul #

1370
01:31:18,194 --> 01:31:21,425
# To you, girl #

1371
01:31:21,498 --> 01:31:24,956
# Didn't I do it, baby #

1372
01:31:25,035 --> 01:31:28,436
# Didn't I do it, baby ##

1373
01:31:32,342 --> 01:31:34,207
What?

1374
01:31:34,277 --> 01:31:37,838
Jackie Brown.

1375
01:31:39,616 --> 01:31:42,483
It ain't like I'm asking you
to go somewhere and spend the night.

1376
01:31:42,552 --> 01:31:45,680
I just want you to go out for
a little while while I work this deal.

1377
01:31:45,755 --> 01:31:47,780
So now you're
going to pout!

1378
01:31:47,857 --> 01:31:50,291
Now it's going to take her 20 minutes
to find her purse, look for her sandals,

1379
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:52,453
find her sunglasses,
get outta here.

1380
01:31:52,529 --> 01:31:54,554
Jackie, Louis.
Louis, Jackie.

1381
01:31:54,631 --> 01:31:56,895
That chick you saw stomping
around the back there,

1382
01:31:56,967 --> 01:32:00,164
that's Melanie
who about to leave!

1383
01:32:00,236 --> 01:32:03,603
Have a good time in there, baby.
Don't burn now.

1384
01:32:03,673 --> 01:32:07,006
- Want a drink?
- No. I want to talk to you now, outside. Now.

1385
01:32:07,077 --> 01:32:10,171
Mm. Let's step
into my office.

1386
01:32:12,582 --> 01:32:16,643
The day I follow Audrey Hill Clayton-

1387
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:19,518
- What's up?
- ... that day, I cut my throat.

1388
01:32:19,589 --> 01:32:22,080
You got that we do it the way
I laid out, or we don't do it at al!

1389
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:24,092
- What the hell you talkin' about?
- What the hell I'm talkin' about?

1390
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:26,424
- Sheronda passed the money on to somebody else.
- How do you know she did that?

1391
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,760
- I was there! I saw it!
- You weren't supposed to be there.

1392
01:32:28,832 --> 01:32:31,096
- I knew you would try to pull some shit like that!
- Hold on!

1393
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:33,431
- I ain't puling no shit!
- What do you call it, then?

1394
01:32:33,503 --> 01:32:35,835
It's my goddamn money! I can do
what the fuck I wanna do with it.

1395
01:32:35,905 --> 01:32:38,169
With my ass on the line,
oh, no, you fuckin' don't!

1396
01:32:38,241 --> 01:32:40,471
- If we don't do it my way, then fuck it!
- Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!

1397
01:32:40,543 --> 01:32:42,636
- Now chill! Chill!
- Oh, no! Chill, my ass! No!

1398
01:32:42,712 --> 01:32:45,909
Listen! Listen!
The woman you saw was my friend Simone.

1399
01:32:45,982 --> 01:32:48,416
She's the one gonna be
receiving the money.

1400
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:51,249
I think she oughta see how the shit
go down. She's a nice woman.

1401
01:32:51,321 --> 01:32:55,121
You'll like her. Matter of fact, she's
on her way over here right now. Hold on.

1402
01:32:55,191 --> 01:32:57,785
Louis, call Simone.
Tell her to get her ass over here.

1403
01:32:57,861 --> 01:33:00,159
We waiting on her.

1404
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:03,791
- Damn! That what youre pissed off about?
- Oh, just a little pissed?

1405
01:33:03,867 --> 01:33:06,734
Mm, mm, mm. I'm sorry.

1406
01:33:06,803 --> 01:33:11,069
I'm about ready for a refill. Are you
sure I can't tempt you a little bit more?

1407
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:13,939
- Come on.
- Okay, fine. Yeah.

1408
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:16,604
You better give me
something strong.

1409
01:33:18,715 --> 01:33:21,878
Now, Nicolet and Dargas are gonna stop
me at the airport and mark your bills.

1410
01:33:21,951 --> 01:33:24,112
I don't like that part.

1411
01:33:24,187 --> 01:33:26,553
It washes off!

1412
01:33:26,623 --> 01:33:30,059
I tell 'em we do the same thing
as before, and they'll follow Sheronda.

1413
01:33:32,395 --> 01:33:35,922
Yo, Louis. Louis?
She ain't there?

1414
01:33:35,999 --> 01:33:38,832
Yo! No answer?

1415
01:33:38,902 --> 01:33:41,462
Now, you gotta listen to this, man,
'cause this concerns you, all right?

1416
01:33:43,573 --> 01:33:45,837
Lou!

1417
01:33:47,777 --> 01:33:51,975
Okay, now, this time youre going to
get Sheronda a Billingsley bag, right?

1418
01:33:52,048 --> 01:33:55,142
Right.
The same one Simone gives me, okay?

1419
01:33:55,218 --> 01:33:59,177
Now, Simone and I make the switch in
Bilingsley. She knows what I look like?

1420
01:33:59,255 --> 01:34:01,052
She's seen you
with Sheronda, remember?

1421
01:34:01,124 --> 01:34:04,025
All right. Now, Simone's gonna meet you
in the dress department, right?

1422
01:34:04,094 --> 01:34:07,291
- Right. Designer clothes.
- Right, right, right, right. The place y'all try shit on.

1423
01:34:07,363 --> 01:34:09,558
It's a fitting room. Big sign
over the door. You can't miss it.

1424
01:34:12,102 --> 01:34:14,332
Why over there?

1425
01:34:14,404 --> 01:34:17,168
Because they're gonna be
watching my ass hard.

1426
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,970
That's why we can't take the risk
in doing it out in the open...

1427
01:34:20,043 --> 01:34:22,068
or even in
the dining area.

1428
01:34:22,145 --> 01:34:24,705
That's why we got to do it
in the fitting room with a woman.

1429
01:34:24,781 --> 01:34:27,375
Okay.
Now, you're going to take...

1430
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:30,214
the Bilingsley bag Simone gives you
and give it to Sheronda.

1431
01:34:30,286 --> 01:34:32,447
- Right.
- And Simone gon' to wait.

1432
01:34:32,522 --> 01:34:35,150
Then she's going to peep out
the dressing room, wait on you...

1433
01:34:35,225 --> 01:34:37,716
to give her the sign
there ain't nobody watching.

1434
01:34:37,794 --> 01:34:39,921
She's going to leave the store,
get in the car, mission accomplished.

1435
01:34:39,996 --> 01:34:42,055
Hey! See?

1436
01:34:42,132 --> 01:34:44,293
So, what are you going
to be doing during all this?

1437
01:34:44,367 --> 01:34:47,336
Now that you got 'em watching my ass, I'm
gonna be in a titty bar waiting on Louis...

1438
01:34:47,403 --> 01:34:49,837
to call me and tell me
everything's cool.

1439
01:34:52,308 --> 01:34:55,141
I got to go! Hey!

1440
01:34:57,747 --> 01:35:01,740
- Damn! Who's wantin' to page you like that?
- It's Ray, the A.T.F. guy.

1441
01:35:01,818 --> 01:35:05,254
That shit work my nerves, you and that
motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.

1442
01:35:05,321 --> 01:35:08,757
Hey, if I wasn't so buddy-buddy with
that motherfucker, this wouldn't work.

1443
01:35:10,527 --> 01:35:13,758
Ordell has a guy
working for him named Louis.

1444
01:35:15,932 --> 01:35:20,096
- You two meet?
- Yeah, this afternoon before I came here.

1445
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:22,604
He was at Ordells apartment
in Hermosa Beach. Yeah.

1446
01:35:22,672 --> 01:35:24,833
I don't know if he lives there,
but I can find out.

1447
01:35:24,908 --> 01:35:28,435
- Did you talk to him?
- Not really.

1448
01:35:28,511 --> 01:35:32,538
His full name's Louis Gara.
Just did four years up in Susanville.

1449
01:35:32,615 --> 01:35:35,743
- For what?
- Bank robbery.

1450
01:35:35,818 --> 01:35:39,584
We've been following him.
He definitely works for Ordell.

1451
01:35:39,656 --> 01:35:42,454
They did two years together about,
I don't know,

1452
01:35:42,525 --> 01:35:45,756
20 years ago or so
over at Huntsville.

1453
01:35:45,828 --> 01:35:48,490
He's not living over
in Hermosa Beach, though.

1454
01:35:48,565 --> 01:35:51,398
Ordells got him staying
down in Compton.

1455
01:35:51,467 --> 01:35:54,800
Living with some 56-year-old
petty thief, some woman named, uh...

1456
01:35:56,072 --> 01:35:58,097
Hawkins, Simone Hawkins.

1457
01:35:59,776 --> 01:36:01,744
- You know her?
- No.

1458
01:36:01,811 --> 01:36:05,303
- They ever talk about her?
- Not yet.

1459
01:36:07,417 --> 01:36:09,408
Okay, who's the other one?

1460
01:36:09,485 --> 01:36:12,420
Some white chick named Melanie,
another girlfriend of Ordell's.

1461
01:36:12,488 --> 01:36:15,116
- What's her deal?
- It was her coke I got busted with.

1462
01:36:15,191 --> 01:36:17,489
- Oh, yeah?
- She knows everything. She's not a part of it,

1463
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:20,393
and she's pissed off
that she's not a part of it.

1464
01:36:20,463 --> 01:36:22,658
Well, this is definitely
somebody I wanna meet.

1465
01:36:22,732 --> 01:36:25,360
Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow?
Everything okay?

1466
01:36:25,435 --> 01:36:28,199
Everything's the same,
except for one change.

1467
01:36:28,271 --> 01:36:31,729
- I told him Ordells changing the amount he's bringing in.
- Think they bought it?

1468
01:36:31,808 --> 01:36:34,709
Mm, oh, yeah. I got 'em thinking
that Ordells real nervous,

1469
01:36:34,777 --> 01:36:37,473
and they love thinking
that he's scared of' em.

1470
01:36:37,547 --> 01:36:42,041
You know, a good cop will never let you
know that he knows you're full of shit.

1471
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:45,053
All he needed was
a reasonable explanation.

1472
01:36:45,121 --> 01:36:47,385
Everything's the same,
except for one change.

1473
01:36:47,457 --> 01:36:49,618
What's that?

1474
01:36:49,692 --> 01:36:51,990
Ordell feels way too hot
for him to bring in his money,

1475
01:36:52,061 --> 01:36:54,359
and he knows you're watching him
and he's fucking paranoid.

1476
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:57,263
- So he's sweating a little bit.
- He's gonna keep his half mil where it is,

1477
01:36:57,333 --> 01:37:00,427
but he's gonna bring in 50,000
just in case he needs bail.

1478
01:37:00,503 --> 01:37:03,301
- It'll be more than that.
- Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.

1479
01:37:03,373 --> 01:37:05,807
You still have to show him
the money at the airport.

1480
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:08,867
I'm not gonna show him the whole amount.
He'll see 50,000.

1481
01:37:08,945 --> 01:37:11,675
- And where's the rest of it?
- In the bag, underneath.

1482
01:37:11,748 --> 01:37:14,182
- What if he checks?
- He won't. He didn't before.

1483
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:18,084
He's expecting to see 50,000,
and there it is, on top.

1484
01:37:19,822 --> 01:37:22,916
- You're taking a hell of a chance, kid.
- Not really.

1485
01:37:22,992 --> 01:37:25,586
If he finds it, I'll say
Mr. Walker put it in there...

1486
01:37:25,662 --> 01:37:28,426
and I didn't know anything about it,
like the coke.

1487
01:37:28,498 --> 01:37:30,932
- Well, then you're out. You get nothing.
- Yeah, but I'm not in jail...

1488
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,093
and at least I tried.

1489
01:37:33,169 --> 01:37:37,071
You're going to have
surveillance all over you.

1490
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:40,541
That's why you don't make a move
until I come out of that fitting room.

1491
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:43,807
- Wearing a dress.
- Well, a suit. There's this one I had my eye on.

1492
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,939
You know, it's like-

1493
01:37:46,015 --> 01:37:47,949
Excuse me.

1494
01:37:50,486 --> 01:37:52,454
Hello?

1495
01:37:52,522 --> 01:37:54,786
Look here, we got
a little change in plans.

1496
01:37:54,857 --> 01:37:57,052
No, no, no, no,
it ain't no thing.

1497
01:37:57,126 --> 01:37:59,458
Everything's the same,
except one little difference.

1498
01:37:59,529 --> 01:38:01,793
You know that bitch Simone
you saw in the mal?

1499
01:38:01,864 --> 01:38:04,389
Well, she wasn't here today
'cause she done split on my ass.

1500
01:38:04,467 --> 01:38:07,231
Yeah. Me and Louis went by her pad.
She gone.

1501
01:38:07,303 --> 01:38:11,330
She gone, her shit's gone and my
10,000 motherfucking dollars is gone.

1502
01:38:11,407 --> 01:38:13,500
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't start buggin' on me.

1503
01:38:13,576 --> 01:38:15,669
Goddamn it, I'm telling you,
ain't nothing different.

1504
01:38:15,745 --> 01:38:17,906
Everything's just like
we discussed.

1505
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:20,346
Now, except for this time
when we make the split,

1506
01:38:20,416 --> 01:38:22,441
instead of Simone
it's gonna be Melanie.

1507
01:38:22,518 --> 01:38:25,385
I think someone's knocking
on the door.

1508
01:38:25,455 --> 01:38:29,482
Goddamn it, Melanie got just as much sense
as that bitch has, she'd be in the same place.

1509
01:38:29,559 --> 01:38:32,426
All right.
Yeah, later.

1510
01:38:32,495 --> 01:38:35,555
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna open it.

1511
01:38:35,631 --> 01:38:38,725
I hope he's a good sailor.

1512
01:38:41,938 --> 01:38:44,099
Chicken shit.

1513
01:39:40,630 --> 01:39:44,862
Okay, the envelope contains $50,000.

1514
01:39:44,934 --> 01:39:48,028
I've counted it,
and I'm now marking the bills...

1515
01:39:48,104 --> 01:39:52,666
in the upper left-hand corner in the
second zero with a green felt-tip pen.

1516
01:39:54,811 --> 01:39:56,972
Ever been tempted?

1517
01:40:00,683 --> 01:40:03,243
What?
Put one of these in my pocket?

1518
01:40:07,924 --> 01:40:10,688
If I did, I'd have to give
one to you, wouldn't I?

1519
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,524
Of course, nobody knows
how much there is.

1520
01:40:13,596 --> 01:40:18,056
I guess we could take as much
as we want. Isn't that right?

1521
01:40:19,235 --> 01:40:21,635
Yes.
All those things are true.

1522
01:40:21,704 --> 01:40:25,970
I mean, it's not like
the money belongs to anybody.

1523
01:40:26,042 --> 01:40:29,034
- That would be one point of view.
- Yeah.

1524
01:40:30,346 --> 01:40:33,281
Except it's not a point of view
shared by the A.T.F.

1525
01:40:34,617 --> 01:40:38,144
Once we make this evidence,
it belongs to us.

1526
01:40:38,221 --> 01:40:42,123
You're officially out of trouble now.

1527
01:40:42,191 --> 01:40:44,284
Don't go doing
something stupid.

1528
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:48,456
How can I do anything stupid
when I'm being watched every second?

1529
01:40:48,531 --> 01:40:50,726
You know,
I'm glad you pointed that out,

1530
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,098
'cause it saves me the trouble
of pointing it out to you.

1531
01:40:53,169 --> 01:40:56,696
Now, look.
Here's the deal.

1532
01:40:56,772 --> 01:40:59,434
I want you to take
all this cash.

1533
01:40:59,509 --> 01:41:02,535
I want you to put it in this
Bilingsley shopping bag.

1534
01:41:02,612 --> 01:41:05,206
And that is exactly
what I expect to see...

1535
01:41:05,281 --> 01:41:08,978
when I look inside Sheronda's
Bilingsley shopping bag.

1536
01:41:09,051 --> 01:41:10,985
Comprende?

1537
01:41:11,053 --> 01:41:13,453
- Si, comprende.
- Cool.

1538
01:41:13,523 --> 01:41:16,856
Hey, there's only three reasons
you couldn't make your court appearance.

1539
01:41:16,926 --> 01:41:21,329
One, you in a hospital; two,
you in jail; three, you ass is dead.

1540
01:41:21,397 --> 01:41:24,332
- That means you're not my friend,
man. Why're you putting- - Winston!

1541
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,335
- Wait. Hold on a second. Wait a minute.
- I'm gonna be gone a few hours.

1542
01:41:27,403 --> 01:41:31,430
- Where you going?
- Dell Amo Mal. Catch a movie, maybe somethin' to eat.

1543
01:41:31,507 --> 01:41:33,566
- What you gonna see?
- Something that starts soon and looks good.

1544
01:41:33,643 --> 01:41:35,611
Cool. Have fun.

1545
01:41:35,678 --> 01:41:39,341
- Let's go!
- In a minute!

1546
01:41:39,415 --> 01:41:41,815
You said that before.
Let's go!

1547
01:41:41,884 --> 01:41:44,682
# Found out she couldn't fly #

1548
01:41:44,754 --> 01:41:46,949
# It was too late #

1549
01:41:47,023 --> 01:41:51,016
# And if its too late
and she's gone too far #

1550
01:41:51,093 --> 01:41:54,290
- Hello?
- Louis? What the fuck you still doing there, man?

1551
01:41:54,363 --> 01:41:57,491
Well, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm waiting on her.
I'm ready to go, yeah.

1552
01:41:57,567 --> 01:42:00,297
You're the one
in motherfucking charge!

1553
01:42:00,369 --> 01:42:02,462
She keeps saying,
"In a minute," right?

1554
01:42:02,538 --> 01:42:04,972
Go in there, grab that bitch by the
hair, drag her fuckin' ass outta there!

1555
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:07,373
That's my goddamn
money we-

1556
01:42:07,443 --> 01:42:09,638
# She didn't know
what she was headed for #

1557
01:42:09,712 --> 01:42:12,510
# And when I found
what she was headed for #

1558
01:42:12,582 --> 01:42:16,040
- Hey, we gotta go! We're late!
- # But it was too late ##

1559
01:42:16,118 --> 01:42:20,077
- Come on, Mel! We gotta go! Let's go!
- Kiss my ass, fuck wad!

1560
01:42:27,063 --> 01:42:29,827
# I play the street life #

1561
01:42:29,899 --> 01:42:32,390
# Because there's
no place I can go #

1562
01:42:32,468 --> 01:42:36,734
# Street life
It's the only life I know #

1563
01:42:36,806 --> 01:42:38,774
# Street life #

1564
01:42:38,841 --> 01:42:41,469
# And there's
a thousand parts to play #

1565
01:42:41,544 --> 01:42:44,945
# Street life
Until you play your life away #

1566
01:42:45,982 --> 01:42:47,950
# You let those people see #

1567
01:42:48,017 --> 01:42:50,417
# Just who you wanna be #

1568
01:42:50,486 --> 01:42:54,752
# And every night you shine
just like a superstar #

1569
01:42:54,824 --> 01:42:58,954
# The travel life has played
A ten-cent masquerade ##

1570
01:42:59,028 --> 01:43:01,758
# I love you #

1571
01:43:01,831 --> 01:43:04,732
# The little gold ring
you wear on your hand #

1572
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,734
You wanna turn it down?

1573
01:43:06,802 --> 01:43:08,770
- # Makes me understand #
- I'm listening to it.

1574
01:43:11,173 --> 01:43:14,939
Louis, man, I've been meaning
to tell you you're a little bit uptight.

1575
01:43:24,887 --> 01:43:28,983
# Street life
But you better not get old #

1576
01:43:29,058 --> 01:43:31,083
# Street life #

1577
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:33,526
# Or youre gonna feel
the cold #

1578
01:43:33,596 --> 01:43:36,064
# There's always
love for sale #

1579
01:43:36,132 --> 01:43:38,566
# A grown-up fairy tale #

1580
01:43:38,634 --> 01:43:42,434
# Prince Charming always smiles
behind a silver spoon #

1581
01:43:42,505 --> 01:43:47,169
# And if youre keeping young
your song is always sung #

1582
01:43:47,243 --> 01:43:52,010
# Your love will pay your way
beneath a silver moon #

1583
01:43:52,081 --> 01:43:54,140
# Street life #

1584
01:43:56,485 --> 01:43:58,612
# Street life #

1585
01:44:00,623 --> 01:44:02,955
# Street life #

1586
01:44:04,527 --> 01:44:06,791
# Oh, street life #

1587
01:44:16,972 --> 01:44:19,065
# Yeah #

1588
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:28,617
# Ooh, I play
the street life #

1589
01:44:28,684 --> 01:44:31,175
# Because there's no place
I can go #

1590
01:44:31,253 --> 01:44:33,187
# Street life #

1591
01:44:33,255 --> 01:44:35,621
# It's the only life
I know #

1592
01:44:35,691 --> 01:44:37,659
# Street life #

1593
01:44:37,727 --> 01:44:40,161
# And there's a thousand parts
to play #

1594
01:44:40,229 --> 01:44:44,893
# Street life
Until you play your life away, oh ##

1595
01:44:54,910 --> 01:44:57,504
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Yeah.

1596
01:44:57,580 --> 01:45:00,708
Um, I think I like that suit.
I'd like to try it on.

1597
01:45:05,888 --> 01:45:08,083
Wow!
You look really cool.

1598
01:45:08,157 --> 01:45:11,684
- Hey, it looks cool on me too.
- It looks great.

1599
01:45:11,761 --> 01:45:15,197
I mean, you wear that suit to a business
meeting, and you'll be the badass in the room.

1600
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:17,528
Yeah? I think I like it.
I'll take it.

1601
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,034
- I'm in a hurry. Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?

1602
01:45:20,102 --> 01:45:22,195
Cash.

1603
01:45:43,159 --> 01:45:45,753
- Melanie?
- Jackie?

1604
01:45:45,828 --> 01:45:48,262
Hey, girl, what's up?

1605
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:51,595
- Hey, are you getting that suit?
- Yeah. You like it?

1606
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:55,626
- It looks really good on you.
- You got something for me?

1607
01:45:55,704 --> 01:45:58,639
You betcha.

1608
01:46:13,255 --> 01:46:16,418
I put a cherry on top.
Booh-yah!

1609
01:46:16,492 --> 01:46:20,019
What the fuck did Ordell
ever do for us, huh?

1610
01:46:20,095 --> 01:46:22,529
Thanks.

1611
01:47:23,926 --> 01:47:27,020
I decided to wear this suit
instead of my tired old uniform.

1612
01:47:27,096 --> 01:47:29,690
- Oh, that's no problem.
- So, how much is it?

1613
01:47:29,765 --> 01:47:33,257
Okay, there's a blouse,

1614
01:47:33,335 --> 01:47:35,701
pants.

1615
01:47:35,771 --> 01:47:39,673
Comes to $267.

1616
01:47:39,742 --> 01:47:41,869
Okay.

1617
01:47:43,445 --> 01:47:46,642
Wait! Your change.

1618
01:47:46,715 --> 01:47:51,152
Uh, by the way, someone left a bag of
beach towels in the last dressing room.

1619
01:49:22,711 --> 01:49:25,646
Ray, Ray, Ray, come out
wherever you are! Ray!

1620
01:49:25,714 --> 01:49:28,683
Ray, come out! Ray, Melanie,
she burst into the dressing room.

1621
01:49:28,751 --> 01:49:30,810
She took all the money
and ran out!

1622
01:49:37,126 --> 01:49:39,686
Aw, fuck.

1623
01:49:39,762 --> 01:49:42,526
Come on. Goddamn, we're late.
Come on.

1624
01:49:42,598 --> 01:49:45,999
- Come on.
- What the fuck?

1625
01:49:46,068 --> 01:49:49,196
We should've been there already, and we would've
if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around.

1626
01:49:49,271 --> 01:49:51,466
Jesus Christ,
Louis, maintain.

1627
01:49:54,343 --> 01:49:56,607
- Jesus. Ow!
- Just- I'm telling you, cut the shit.

1628
01:49:56,678 --> 01:49:59,112
Ow.

1629
01:50:02,684 --> 01:50:05,517
Idiot.

1630
01:50:05,587 --> 01:50:07,521
- Just let go.
- Straighten up, bitch.

1631
01:50:07,589 --> 01:50:09,580
- You fuckin' mongoloid.
- Fuckin'-

1632
01:50:09,658 --> 01:50:12,786
Oh, now, look at this. This is nice-

1633
01:50:12,861 --> 01:50:16,058
I think I like it.
I'll take it. I'm in a hurry.

1634
01:50:16,131 --> 01:50:18,065
- Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?

1635
01:50:18,133 --> 01:50:20,067
Cash.

1636
01:50:25,808 --> 01:50:29,744
It's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go
over and look at this Michi Moon display.

1637
01:50:29,812 --> 01:50:33,407
You just stay right fuckin' here,
all right? Just stay right here.

1638
01:50:33,482 --> 01:50:36,042
Are you sweating?

1639
01:50:37,252 --> 01:50:39,846
Job a little too much
for you?

1640
01:50:49,098 --> 01:50:51,225
I'm gonna be
over there.

1641
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:54,599
- You just stay right here.
- 'Cause you're a little bit too conspicuous.

1642
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:59,073
I don't care how conspicuous,
you fuckin' stay here.

1643
01:50:59,141 --> 01:51:01,803
Hey, would you let go!

1644
01:51:06,648 --> 01:51:09,481
Designer Clothes.

1645
01:51:14,656 --> 01:51:18,524
Fuck it.

1646
01:51:44,786 --> 01:51:46,720
Look, where you goin'?

1647
01:51:46,788 --> 01:51:48,722
- Getting out of here. What do you think?
- Let me have the bag.

1648
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:51,782
- Fuck you. I can carry it.
- Goddamn, give me the bag.

1649
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:54,693
- Fuck you-
- What, you're gonna rip the fuckin' bag?

1650
01:51:54,763 --> 01:51:57,630
Give me that bag
before I knock you the fuck up.

1651
01:51:57,699 --> 01:52:00,566
- Take your fuckin' hands off.
- Okay, okay. Jesus, what's wrong with you?

1652
01:52:00,636 --> 01:52:03,400
- I'm carryin' the bag.
- All right, you got it. Take a chill pill, for chrissake.

1653
01:52:03,472 --> 01:52:05,633
Fuck you
and your chill pill.

1654
01:52:05,707 --> 01:52:09,871
'Member where we came in?
No, that's towards Sears.

1655
01:52:09,945 --> 01:52:13,142
Where the f-
Which way? Which way?

1656
01:52:17,052 --> 01:52:20,510
Jesus, but if you two aren't
the biggest pair of fuck ups...

1657
01:52:20,589 --> 01:52:23,080
I've ever met
in my entire life.

1658
01:52:23,158 --> 01:52:25,991
How did you ever rob
a bank?

1659
01:52:26,061 --> 01:52:29,553
Hey, when you robbed banks, did you
have to look for your car then too?

1660
01:52:30,666 --> 01:52:33,100
No wonder you went
to jail.

1661
01:52:35,437 --> 01:52:38,031
Is it this aisle, Louis?

1662
01:52:38,106 --> 01:52:40,040
Is it?

1663
01:52:44,813 --> 01:52:46,872
Louis?

1664
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:51,044
Lou-isss?

1665
01:52:53,922 --> 01:52:56,857
Is it this aisle,
or is it the next one over?

1666
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:00,392
- It's this one.
- You sure?

1667
01:53:00,462 --> 01:53:03,295
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- You positive? You don't seem sure to me.

1668
01:53:03,365 --> 01:53:06,232
Hey, don't say-

1669
01:53:06,301 --> 01:53:09,395
Don't say anything else, okay?
Keep your mouth shut.

1670
01:53:09,471 --> 01:53:12,907
- Well- - I mean it. Don't
say one fuckin' word, okay?

1671
01:53:12,975 --> 01:53:15,307
Okay, Louis.

1672
01:53:24,353 --> 01:53:26,617
See, just where
I said it was.

1673
01:53:30,225 --> 01:53:32,159
God.

1674
01:53:43,438 --> 01:53:46,339
# In my midnight confession #

1675
01:53:46,408 --> 01:53:49,104
# When I'm tellin' the world
that I love you #

1676
01:53:52,214 --> 01:53:57,948
# In my midnight confession #

1677
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:01,387
# When I said all the things
that I want to #

1678
01:54:07,963 --> 01:54:11,228
# A love you never knew, girl #

1679
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:16,397
# Ooh, didn't I do it, baby #

1680
01:54:16,471 --> 01:54:19,998
# Didn't I do- ##

1681
01:54:36,458 --> 01:54:38,722
Can I show you something?

1682
01:54:38,794 --> 01:54:42,252
Not right now. I'm just killin' time,
waitin' for my wife.

1683
01:54:42,331 --> 01:54:46,665
Oh, sure thing. Well,
if anything grabs you, don't be shy.

1684
01:54:46,735 --> 01:54:48,760
I won't. Thanks.

1685
01:54:50,205 --> 01:54:52,673
- Wow, you look really cool.
- Oh, yeah.

1686
01:54:52,741 --> 01:54:56,700
- Hey, it looks cool on me too.
- It looks great. I mean, you wear that-

1687
01:54:56,778 --> 01:54:59,747
- Straighten up, bitch.
- You fuckin' mongoloid.

1688
01:54:59,815 --> 01:55:03,751
- Now, look at this.
- I think I like it.

1689
01:55:03,819 --> 01:55:05,753
I'll take it. I'm in a hurry.
Can you ring it up for me?

1690
01:55:05,821 --> 01:55:08,289
- Cash or charge?
- Cash.

1691
01:55:12,427 --> 01:55:14,759
Hey, would you let go!

1692
01:55:25,207 --> 01:55:27,437
Designer Clothes.

1693
01:56:07,949 --> 01:56:10,850
I decided to wear the suit
instead of my tired old uniform.

1694
01:56:10,919 --> 01:56:14,082
- Oh, that's no problem. I understand.
- How much is it?

1695
01:56:14,156 --> 01:56:18,354
- Okay, blouse, pants.
- And away we go.

1696
01:56:18,427 --> 01:56:21,590
Comes to $267.

1697
01:56:21,663 --> 01:56:24,791
- Here you go.
- Wait! Your change!

1698
01:56:24,866 --> 01:56:29,963
By the way, someone left a bag of
beach towels in the last dressing room.

1699
01:56:54,763 --> 01:56:56,822
Excuse me.

1700
01:56:56,898 --> 01:57:00,732
My wife thinks she left a bag
of beach towels in the fitting room.

1701
01:57:00,802 --> 01:57:03,862
Yeah, I think they're there. Go get 'em.
There's nobody in there.

1702
01:57:03,939 --> 01:57:06,373
- Thanks.
- Last stall.

1703
01:58:19,481 --> 01:58:21,608
Got it.

1704
01:59:10,198 --> 01:59:14,191
I wasn't even gonna buy anything.

1705
01:59:26,414 --> 01:59:29,713
#... do it, baby #

1706
01:59:29,784 --> 01:59:34,915
# I tried so many times
and that's no lie #

1707
01:59:36,524 --> 01:59:41,757
# It seems to make you laugh
each time I cry ##

1708
01:59:54,542 --> 01:59:58,103
All right. Just keep drivin' to Ninth,
where all them car dealerships is.

1709
01:59:58,179 --> 02:00:00,113
We gonna leave this heap
in the parking lot and pick up...

1710
02:00:00,181 --> 02:00:03,082
a car the cops don't know
nothin' about.

1711
02:00:03,151 --> 02:00:05,642
Where's Melanie?

1712
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:07,984
Well, that's what I wanna tell you. You
see, she was buggin' me the whole time.

1713
02:00:08,056 --> 02:00:10,684
She got pissy with me 'cause
I wouldn't let her carry the bag.

1714
02:00:10,759 --> 02:00:13,523
And then she started runnin' her
fuckin' mouth about, you know, like-

1715
02:00:13,595 --> 02:00:16,257
'cause I couldn't remember where the car
was parked right away when we came out.

1716
02:00:16,331 --> 02:00:19,198
So then she got on me about that.
"Is it this aisle, Louis?

1717
02:00:19,267 --> 02:00:21,963
Is it that aisle, Louis?" It was
totally fuckin' with my nerves, man.

1718
02:00:22,037 --> 02:00:25,302
- So, what? You left her there?
- I-I shot her.

1719
02:00:28,443 --> 02:00:30,775
You shot Melanie?

1720
02:00:30,845 --> 02:00:33,814
- Twice. In the parking lot.
- You couldn't talk to her?

1721
02:00:33,882 --> 02:00:36,976
- Well, how can you talk to her? You know how she is.
- You couldn't just hit her?

1722
02:00:37,052 --> 02:00:40,215
Maybe, but at that time-
moment, I don't know, I-

1723
02:00:40,288 --> 02:00:42,586
You shot her?
Twice?

1724
02:00:44,526 --> 02:00:48,792
- Is she dead?
- I-I- Pretty much.

1725
02:00:48,863 --> 02:00:50,831
What do you mean "pretty much," Louis?
That ain't no fuckin' answer.

1726
02:00:50,899 --> 02:00:52,924
- Yes or no. Is she dead?
- I-I think so.

1727
02:00:53,001 --> 02:00:55,526
- You think so? Tell me Louis. Is she-
- She's dead. She's dead.

1728
02:00:55,603 --> 02:00:58,367
- Well, where'd you shoot her?
- In the chest and the stomach.

1729
02:00:59,741 --> 02:01:03,199
If you had to do it,
then you had to do it, brother.

1730
02:01:03,278 --> 02:01:06,042
What we don't want
is that bitch survivin' on us.

1731
02:01:06,114 --> 02:01:08,048
Anybody but that woman.

1732
02:01:21,196 --> 02:01:23,130
Louis?

1733
02:01:23,198 --> 02:01:25,132
What?

1734
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:27,134
Where's the rest of it?

1735
02:01:27,202 --> 02:01:31,536
- How much is there?
- I don't know. Maybe 40. Shit, maybe less.

1736
02:01:31,606 --> 02:01:34,166
Well, you-
you said 550.

1737
02:01:34,242 --> 02:01:37,734
Yeah, so you light, ain't you?
You light about half a million, ten.

1738
02:01:37,812 --> 02:01:40,110
Look, look, man.
That's the bag she came out with.

1739
02:01:40,181 --> 02:01:42,945
- She never put her hand in it. Neither did I.
- Came out of where?

1740
02:01:43,017 --> 02:01:45,645
The fitting room. It went down
exactly the way it was supposed to.

1741
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:49,053
- How long was she in there?
- A minute. Not even a minute. She came right out.

1742
02:01:49,124 --> 02:01:51,854
- Louis, you tellin' me the truth?
- Listen, I swear to God, man.

1743
02:01:51,926 --> 02:01:55,589
I swear on my life. She came out with
that fuckin' bag, and I took it from her.

1744
02:01:55,663 --> 02:01:57,654
- And then what?
- And that was it. We went to the parking lot.

1745
02:01:57,732 --> 02:02:01,259
- Where you shot her?
- That's right.

1746
02:02:01,336 --> 02:02:03,736
Louis, you sure Melanie ain't in a room
somewhere with a half million dollars...

1747
02:02:03,805 --> 02:02:05,966
I worked my ass off to get
waitin' for you?

1748
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:09,134
- Oh, fuck you for asking me that.
- Hey, I know the bitch tried to set me up.

1749
02:02:09,210 --> 02:02:12,236
- Fuck you, brother. How could you fuckin' ask me that?
- She didn't ask you?

1750
02:02:14,716 --> 02:02:16,650
Shit!

1751
02:02:18,586 --> 02:02:21,248
Pull the car
over a minute.

1752
02:02:23,691 --> 02:02:25,625
Why'd you ask me that?

1753
02:02:33,434 --> 02:02:36,369
- All right, so where's
the gun you shot her with?

1754
02:02:36,437 --> 02:02:38,371
It's in there.

1755
02:02:40,275 --> 02:02:43,802
Now, what the fuck's that gonna tell ya?
I could've taken two out already.

1756
02:03:09,571 --> 02:03:12,131
It's Jackie Brown.

1757
02:03:14,242 --> 02:03:17,075
Well, you know, if she got to it,
why didn't she take it al?

1758
02:03:17,145 --> 02:03:19,579
Oh, I'll be sure and ask that bitch
before I blow her brains out.

1759
02:03:19,647 --> 02:03:21,774
Well, maybe the Feds
got it.

1760
02:03:21,900 --> 02:03:24,842
See, if there wasn't
nothin' in that bag but them towels,

1761
02:03:24,919 --> 02:03:27,149
then maybe she didn't get
a chance to take the money...

1762
02:03:27,222 --> 02:03:29,156
out of her suitcase
and the A.T.F. got it.

1763
02:03:29,224 --> 02:03:31,215
But she put them books
in there to trick our ass.

1764
02:03:31,292 --> 02:03:33,283
Well, that's why I didn't check it.
Because the bag felt right.

1765
02:03:33,361 --> 02:03:37,229
That's right. And then she puts 40 grand
or so in there to rub that shit in my face.

1766
02:03:37,298 --> 02:03:40,597
You know what I'm sayin'?
She wants me to know she ripped me off.

1767
02:03:40,668 --> 02:03:45,071
Ah. I don- I don- You know,
I don't know. I don't know.

1768
02:03:45,139 --> 02:03:48,438
Unless, you know, either she's
got it or the Feds got it.

1769
02:03:48,509 --> 02:03:51,706
Or- Or-
Now, check this out.

1770
02:03:51,779 --> 02:03:54,714
What if she gave the money
to somebody else first...

1771
02:03:54,782 --> 02:03:57,751
before Melanie even went
in the dressing room.

1772
02:04:01,623 --> 02:04:04,251
- Oh, man. You know what?
- What?

1773
02:04:04,325 --> 02:04:07,761
- Do you know who I saw in the dress department?
- No, tell me.

1774
02:04:07,829 --> 02:04:11,094
I didn't think anything of it. I
- No, no, I did wonder what he was doin' there.

1775
02:04:11,165 --> 02:04:13,998
I wondered what he was doin' there, but
I thought it had nothin' to do with us.

1776
02:04:14,068 --> 02:04:16,730
Like, maybe he was with his wife
or his girlfriend. It's a big place-

1777
02:04:16,804 --> 02:04:19,568
Louis, Louis, Louis!
You gonna tell me who you saw?

1778
02:04:19,641 --> 02:04:22,303
- Yeah, Max Cherry.
- Max Che-

1779
02:04:26,814 --> 02:04:29,647
You seen Max Cherry
in the dress department where we-

1780
02:04:29,717 --> 02:04:32,618
Man, look at me
when I'm talkin' to you!

1781
02:04:32,687 --> 02:04:35,485
You see that motherfucker in the dress department
when we about to get a half million dollars.

1782
02:04:35,556 --> 02:04:38,286
- And you don't think nothin' about him bein' there?
- No. Do they know each other?

1783
02:04:38,359 --> 02:04:40,589
Hell, yeah, they know each other.
He bonded her ass out of County.

1784
02:04:40,662 --> 02:04:43,256
- Well, how am I supposed to know that?
- You know your bail bondsmen.

1785
02:04:43,331 --> 02:04:46,732
You know all them motherfuckers is
crooked as a barrel of snakes, don't you?

1786
02:04:46,801 --> 02:04:49,463
Why should I think something's weird if I don't
know nothin' about them knowin' each other?

1787
02:04:49,537 --> 02:04:51,528
- I don't wanna hear no fuckin' excuses, Louis.
- I ain't givin' you excuses.

1788
02:04:51,606 --> 02:04:54,302
But I'm tellin' you- I don't fuckin'-
I'm givin' you fuckin' reasons.

1789
02:04:54,375 --> 02:04:56,536
Oh, you gonna tell me
the reason...

1790
02:04:56,611 --> 02:04:59,205
you lost every goddamned cent
I got in the world?

1791
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,976
- Hey- Hey, man.
- You gonna tell me reasons?

1792
02:05:02,050 --> 02:05:04,314
- You better- - Let me tell
you the reason, motherfucker.

1793
02:05:04,385 --> 02:05:07,377
The reason is your ass
ain't worth a shit no more.

1794
02:05:07,455 --> 02:05:09,855
You better fuckin'
back off, man.

1795
02:05:16,497 --> 02:05:20,263
What the fuck happened to you, man?

1796
02:05:20,335 --> 02:05:24,772
Her ass used
to be beautiful.

1797
02:06:06,948 --> 02:06:09,644
You didn't tell me
you were goin' shoppin'.

1798
02:06:09,717 --> 02:06:12,345
- I thought I did.
- Yeah, well, you didn't.

1799
02:06:20,828 --> 02:06:23,456
You know,
if its me...

1800
02:06:23,531 --> 02:06:26,796
and I got all that shit hangin' over
my head like you got hangin' over yours,

1801
02:06:26,868 --> 02:06:29,098
I don't know,
I'd go shoppin' later.

1802
02:06:29,170 --> 02:06:32,196
Well, I got there early.
You see, I've had my eye on this suit...

1803
02:06:32,273 --> 02:06:33,865
that I've wanted, and, well,
I'm just gonna go try it on-

1804
02:06:33,941 --> 02:06:35,875
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Wait, wait, wait. Just wait a minute.

1805
02:06:35,943 --> 02:06:40,209
Just wait a fuckin' second, all right?
Let me finish.

1806
02:06:40,281 --> 02:06:44,877
I got there early. The idea was to
try on the suit, see if I liked it.

1807
02:06:44,952 --> 02:06:47,682
If I did, they would wrap it up,
and I would put back on my uniform...

1808
02:06:47,755 --> 02:06:50,485
'cause Sheronda
is expecting me to wear it.

1809
02:06:50,558 --> 02:06:54,426
Meet Sheronda, give her the shopping bag
with the $50,000 and go home.

1810
02:06:54,495 --> 02:06:56,759
Yeah, but you didn't do that.

1811
02:06:56,831 --> 02:06:59,197
Because I couldn't.
Ray, I swear.

1812
02:06:59,267 --> 02:07:01,997
Melanie burst in.
She grabbed the bag.

1813
02:07:02,070 --> 02:07:04,538
And then somebody
fuckin' killed her for it.

1814
02:07:11,312 --> 02:07:13,780
What happened
to the bag she gave you?

1815
02:07:13,848 --> 02:07:18,308
She didn't give me a bag.
Melanie was not a part of the plan.

1816
02:07:18,386 --> 02:07:20,411
Ordell probably told her
to do it.

1817
02:07:20,488 --> 02:07:22,615
That's why she came into the dressing
room, grabbed the bag, took off.

1818
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:25,625
But I couldn't go after her,
because I was in my fucking underwear.

1819
02:07:25,693 --> 02:07:28,218
And I had to put on this suit because I
could put it on faster than my uniform-

1820
02:07:28,296 --> 02:07:31,163
- You had time to pay the sales chick.
- I had to. Ray, I was frantic.

1821
02:07:31,232 --> 02:07:33,928
What was I supposed
to do?

1822
02:07:40,007 --> 02:07:42,498
All right,
what you do after that?

1823
02:07:42,577 --> 02:07:45,341
I went lookin' for you. And I went
back to the place in the mal...

1824
02:07:45,413 --> 02:07:47,506
where you were before,
but you weren't there.

1825
02:07:47,582 --> 02:07:51,109
What was I supposed to do if something
happens? You didn't tell me how to do that.

1826
02:07:51,185 --> 02:07:54,313
There was a guy
with Melanie?

1827
02:07:54,388 --> 02:07:56,322
There was nobody
in the fitting room.

1828
02:08:01,028 --> 02:08:02,962
Okay.

1829
02:08:09,003 --> 02:08:12,495
You've no idea what happened
to the $50,000.

1830
02:08:12,573 --> 02:08:16,009
- You're clueless, right? You've no idea where the 50 grand is?
- I have no idea.

1831
02:08:16,077 --> 02:08:18,773
- None. - You have no idea- It could've
gone here, could've gone there?

1832
02:08:18,846 --> 02:08:22,907
I know nothin'. Not a clue. I don't have
an idea where the motherfuckin' money is.

1833
02:08:22,984 --> 02:08:25,350
- Not even a little idea. A maybe.
- Not a tiny motherfuckin' idea.

1834
02:08:25,419 --> 02:08:28,286
- You'd take a polygraph?
- Yeah, if it'd motherfuckin' make you happy!

1835
02:08:28,356 --> 02:08:31,883
Yeah, put it right there.
I'll do it.

1836
02:08:31,959 --> 02:08:33,893
Man.

1837
02:08:42,870 --> 02:08:45,964
I sure hope you didn't do
anything stupid, Jackie.

1838
02:08:50,244 --> 02:08:52,838
Can I talk to you
for a second?

1839
02:09:09,063 --> 02:09:11,497
Fuck.

1840
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:30,279
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him
shot in the car on Ninth.

1841
02:09:30,351 --> 02:09:32,683
And we lost Ordell.

1842
02:09:32,753 --> 02:09:35,517
I thought you were
fuckin' watchin' him.

1843
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:38,252
We were,
and we lost him.

1844
02:09:38,326 --> 02:09:42,194
He walked into a strip bar sometime
around 3:30 and never came out.

1845
02:09:42,263 --> 02:09:47,098
The bar was on Ninth, what, less than a
mile and a half from where they found Louis.

1846
02:09:47,168 --> 02:09:49,636
It looks like Louis' buddy
shot him twice, point-blank range.

1847
02:09:49,704 --> 02:09:53,071
- So what's gonna happen now?
- We pick up Ordell.

1848
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:56,200
We got three murders we can link him to,
and we got you.

1849
02:09:56,277 --> 02:09:58,745
What about me?

1850
02:09:58,813 --> 02:10:02,078
What about you?

1851
02:10:02,149 --> 02:10:04,583
You think I took
some of that money?

1852
02:10:04,652 --> 02:10:07,143
Hey, I have no evidence
of you doin' anything.

1853
02:10:08,823 --> 02:10:11,587
You didn't pay for that snazzy new suit
with marked bills.

1854
02:10:11,659 --> 02:10:14,787
I'm glad to see that.
You've been helpin' us out.

1855
02:10:14,862 --> 02:10:17,592
You gave us Melanie.
You gave us Louis.

1856
02:10:17,665 --> 02:10:23,399
Melanie was found with a packet
of marked bills stuffed in her shorts.

1857
02:10:23,471 --> 02:10:26,372
That goes a long way
in backing up your story.

1858
02:10:28,776 --> 02:10:31,711
I'll settle for Ordell
with marked bills.

1859
02:10:34,715 --> 02:10:37,047
But if there's
anything else...

1860
02:10:37,118 --> 02:10:42,112
you haven't told me about, you know
what, that's between you and Ordell.

1861
02:10:42,189 --> 02:10:45,317
I just got one thing
to say.

1862
02:10:45,393 --> 02:10:48,385
You better hope we find him
before he finds you.

1863
02:10:48,663 --> 02:10:52,190
No, no, no, I done told you,
I can't leave here tomorrow, Mr. Walker.

1864
02:10:52,266 --> 02:10:57,294
I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway
till I get my motherfuckin' money.

1865
02:10:57,371 --> 02:11:01,398
Come on, man, if it wasn't for me, you
wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat.

1866
02:11:01,475 --> 02:11:05,912
Oh, yeah, yeah, right. I'm seein' who
my friends are, motherfucker, right-

1867
02:11:05,980 --> 02:11:09,575
Hello? Hello?

1868
02:11:09,650 --> 02:11:13,586
Motherfucker hung up on me.
You believe that shit?

1869
02:11:13,654 --> 02:11:17,920
Ingrate nigger.
See, you bring a motherfucker up,

1870
02:11:17,992 --> 02:11:21,359
next thing you know they breaking
you off some goddamned disrespect.

1871
02:11:21,429 --> 02:11:24,830
Motherfuck!
Shit!

1872
02:11:25,933 --> 02:11:29,232
Goddamn, girl.
How you live like this?

1873
02:11:29,303 --> 02:11:31,828
- Like what?
- Like this.

1874
02:11:31,906 --> 02:11:34,397
This some repugnant shit.

1875
02:11:34,475 --> 02:11:37,933
Bail bonds.

1876
02:11:38,012 --> 02:11:40,446
- Yeah, Max there?
- He ain't here right now, man.

1877
02:11:40,514 --> 02:11:43,449
- Well, where he at? Out of town?
- He's around, man.

1878
02:11:43,517 --> 02:11:45,849
- Well, give me his home number.
- No, I'll give you his beeper number!

1879
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:48,115
All right.
Break out the beeper number, nigger.

1880
02:11:56,697 --> 02:12:00,155
- Yeah.
- I've been looking for you.

1881
02:12:00,234 --> 02:12:05,365
- Do you know who this is?
- This is Mr. Robbie, isn't it?

1882
02:12:05,439 --> 02:12:08,431
I have your 10,000.
That's why you called.

1883
02:12:10,277 --> 02:12:14,270
The bond collateral that you put down
on Beaumont Livingston...

1884
02:12:14,348 --> 02:12:16,839
and moved over
to Miss Brown, remember?

1885
02:12:17,952 --> 02:12:20,045
Oh, she got off,
did she?

1886
02:12:20,121 --> 02:12:23,318
They decided to no-file
this morning.

1887
02:12:23,391 --> 02:12:25,689
Tell me where you are.
I'll come give you your money.

1888
02:12:30,197 --> 02:12:32,290
You still there?

1889
02:12:34,101 --> 02:12:37,434
Look here, man.
I know you helped her.

1890
02:12:37,505 --> 02:12:39,405
And I know you know
what I want.

1891
02:12:39,473 --> 02:12:43,102
And Jackie can tell me any story
comes into her pretty little head,

1892
02:12:43,177 --> 02:12:48,171
as long as at the end of that story
she hands me my motherfuckin' money.

1893
02:12:48,249 --> 02:12:52,083
Now, she wanna be my friend,
she do that.

1894
02:12:52,153 --> 02:12:54,815
She don't want to be
my friend no more,

1895
02:12:54,889 --> 02:12:58,256
well, you just tell her
to think about old Beaumont.

1896
02:12:58,325 --> 02:13:00,418
And if she go to the police,

1897
02:13:00,494 --> 02:13:04,157
you tell her I will name her ass
as my accessory.

1898
02:13:04,231 --> 02:13:08,691
And we'll go upstate,
hand in handcuffed motherfuckin' hand.

1899
02:13:08,769 --> 02:13:11,966
And that's a promise.
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?

1900
02:13:12,039 --> 02:13:15,531
You tell her that,
and I'll call you back.

1901
02:13:18,712 --> 02:13:22,375
You're right.
It was Ordell.

1902
02:13:22,450 --> 02:13:27,285
If you have time, do you think you could
find out where he's stayin' for me?

1903
02:13:27,354 --> 02:13:29,822
Cops can't locate him, huh?

1904
02:13:29,890 --> 02:13:33,621
- They don't have
your winning personality.

1905
02:13:33,694 --> 02:13:37,755
Sure thing. I don't have to know what
I'm doing, just as long as you know.

1906
02:13:37,832 --> 02:13:41,324
I think I do.
Good enough?

1907
02:13:41,402 --> 02:13:43,336
You bet.

1908
02:13:58,452 --> 02:14:00,943
Fuck's wrong with you, knockin' on
the door like the goddamned police?

1909
02:14:01,021 --> 02:14:03,546
- You lookin' to get shot?
- I thought you might be asleep.

1910
02:14:03,624 --> 02:14:06,991
You keep fuckin' with me,
you the one gonna be asleep- forever.

1911
02:14:07,061 --> 02:14:09,689
I'm alone.

1912
02:14:09,763 --> 02:14:12,698
Get your ass
in the house.

1913
02:14:18,339 --> 02:14:20,330
No, freeze, motherfucker.
What you doin'?

1914
02:14:20,407 --> 02:14:24,343
Got your money-
your bond refund?

1915
02:14:24,411 --> 02:14:26,675
This al?

1916
02:14:26,747 --> 02:14:28,806
- I have a receipt for you to sign.
- No, no, no, motherfucker.

1917
02:14:28,883 --> 02:14:31,852
You know what I mean.
You talked to her?

1918
02:14:31,919 --> 02:14:34,353
She wants to give you
your money.

1919
02:14:34,421 --> 02:14:38,016
If she didn't, there'd be cops
batter-ramming your door down right now.

1920
02:14:38,092 --> 02:14:40,322
- How'd you find me, anyway?
- Winston found you.

1921
02:14:40,394 --> 02:14:42,385
- How'd he find me?
- That's what he does.

1922
02:14:42,463 --> 02:14:44,397
He finds people
that don't wanna be found.

1923
02:14:44,465 --> 02:14:47,025
Oh, well,
bully for that nigger.

1924
02:14:47,101 --> 02:14:49,262
So, she wanna give me
my money, huh?

1925
02:14:49,336 --> 02:14:54,740
Yeah. She wants to give it to you herself,
and she wants to collect her ten percent.

1926
02:14:54,808 --> 02:14:58,039
She also wants to explain
why she had to hang on to it.

1927
02:14:58,112 --> 02:15:00,876
Oh, and I wanna hear
that shit too.

1928
02:15:00,948 --> 02:15:03,883
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.

1929
02:15:10,658 --> 02:15:13,456
Why dont you
tell me why?

1930
02:15:13,527 --> 02:15:16,963
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already
tried to get Jackie to go in with her,

1931
02:15:17,031 --> 02:15:20,194
split the half million
amongst themselves.

1932
02:15:20,267 --> 02:15:23,896
What she did was take quite a risk
to make sure you got your money.

1933
02:15:23,971 --> 02:15:27,065
And you helped her,
didnt you?

1934
02:15:27,141 --> 02:15:29,769
All I did was walk out
with it.

1935
02:15:29,843 --> 02:15:33,904
Y'all went to all that trouble
just to protect my interest?

1936
02:15:33,981 --> 02:15:36,347
In a way, yes.

1937
02:15:38,852 --> 02:15:43,653
My ass may be dumb,
but I ain't no dumb ass.

1938
02:15:43,724 --> 02:15:45,817
Go over there and sit
on that couch.

1939
02:15:47,595 --> 02:15:50,325
Don't worry about her.
She don't even know youre here.

1940
02:15:50,397 --> 02:15:52,831
Sit down.

1941
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:54,891
Place stinks.

1942
02:15:54,969 --> 02:15:57,096
You get used to it.

1943
02:15:58,372 --> 02:16:01,136
- Where my money at?
- My office.

1944
02:16:01,208 --> 02:16:04,371
- Where Jackie at?
- She's been there since Thursday night.

1945
02:16:04,445 --> 02:16:06,413
If she want to talk to me,
how come she wasn't home?

1946
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:09,972
- She's afraid.
- Oh, right. That I gotta see.

1947
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:13,577
She still is. She doesn't wanna get shot
before she can tell you what happened.

1948
02:16:13,654 --> 02:16:16,919
- Tell her to bring the money over here.
- It's in the safe:, she can't.

1949
02:16:16,991 --> 02:16:18,925
Call her and give her
the combination.

1950
02:16:18,993 --> 02:16:21,359
Look, I'm tellin' you,
you got her spooked.

1951
02:16:21,428 --> 02:16:24,920
She won't leave there till you
get your money and you're gone.

1952
02:16:24,999 --> 02:16:26,990
Oh, you expect me
to just go walkin' in there?

1953
02:16:27,067 --> 02:16:29,729
If she wanted to set you up,
you'd be in custody by now.

1954
02:16:29,803 --> 02:16:33,796
When you told her that you'd name her as an
accessory, that scared her more than anything.

1955
02:16:33,874 --> 02:16:37,640
She believed you.

1956
02:16:37,711 --> 02:16:40,441
Then that's why she wanted
to give me my money, ain't it?

1957
02:16:40,514 --> 02:16:44,211
It ain't got nothin' to do
with that bullshit about Melanie, huh?

1958
02:16:44,284 --> 02:16:47,879
See, I ain't trust Melanie,
either, but I could handle her.

1959
02:16:47,955 --> 02:16:50,719
That was my little
blonde-haired surfer girl.

1960
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:55,653
And I told that fuckin' Louis all he
had to do was hit her in the mouth.

1961
02:16:55,729 --> 02:16:59,028
But no,
he had to shoot her.

1962
02:17:03,237 --> 02:17:05,467
Jackie's at your office, huh?

1963
02:17:05,539 --> 02:17:08,838
She by herself? That big-ass nigger
Winston ain't there, is he?

1964
02:17:08,909 --> 02:17:11,469
She's all alone.

1965
02:17:11,545 --> 02:17:13,945
All right.

1966
02:17:14,014 --> 02:17:17,814
I call over there,
she better answer the phone.

1967
02:17:17,885 --> 02:17:19,819
She will.

1968
02:17:28,095 --> 02:17:33,192
I'll be here.
See you in a bit.

1969
02:18:10,571 --> 02:18:13,836
Goddamn. In all the time I've known her,

1970
02:18:13,907 --> 02:18:16,603
I ain't never heard her
scared like that.

1971
02:18:16,677 --> 02:18:19,271
Usually, she too cool
for school.

1972
02:18:19,346 --> 02:18:23,407
Hold up, home.
Give me the keys. I'll drive.

1973
02:19:11,398 --> 02:19:13,992
I didn't know
you liked the Delfonics.

1974
02:19:16,503 --> 02:19:18,494
They're pretty good.

1975
02:19:19,773 --> 02:19:25,803
# I gave my heart and soul
to you, girl #

1976
02:19:43,463 --> 02:19:48,594
# But this time
I'm really leavin' you, girl #

1977
02:19:48,669 --> 02:19:53,163
# Oh, oh
Hope you know it, baby #

1978
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:56,334
# Hope you know it, baby #

1979
02:20:16,063 --> 02:20:18,930
# Didn't I do it, baby #

1980
02:20:28,542 --> 02:20:31,807
# Didn't I blow your mind
this time #

1981
02:20:31,879 --> 02:20:35,042
# Didn't I, ohh #

1982
02:20:35,115 --> 02:20:38,607
# Didn't I blow your mind
this time #

1983
02:20:38,685 --> 02:20:41,347
# Didn't I
I got to leave you, baby #

1984
02:20:54,001 --> 02:20:56,936
My money's in
that office, right?

1985
02:20:59,339 --> 02:21:02,308
I f she start giving me some
bullshit about it ain't there...

1986
02:21:02,376 --> 02:21:04,640
and we gotta go
someplace else and get it,

1987
02:21:04,711 --> 02:21:08,909
I'm gonna shoot you in the head
right then and there.

1988
02:21:08,982 --> 02:21:14,443
Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the
kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is.

1989
02:21:14,521 --> 02:21:17,251
She gonna tell I me too.

1990
02:21:17,324 --> 02:21:21,226
Hey, look at me when I'm
talkin' to you, motherfucker.

1991
02:21:24,665 --> 02:21:26,758
Listen.

1992
02:21:26,833 --> 02:21:31,463
I go walkin' in there and that nigger
Winston or anybody else is in there,

1993
02:21:31,538 --> 02:21:34,632
you the first motherfucker gets shot,
you understand me?

1994
02:21:34,708 --> 02:21:36,938
Yeah.

1995
02:21:39,313 --> 02:21:43,147
There ain't nothin' you wanna tell me
before we get out of this car, is there?

1996
02:21:43,216 --> 02:21:48,279
- No.
- Last chance, motherfucker. You sure?

1997
02:21:54,161 --> 02:21:56,595
You better be, motherfucker.

1998
02:21:58,332 --> 02:22:00,300
All right.

1999
02:22:00,367 --> 02:22:02,801
Let's roll.

2000
02:22:15,248 --> 02:22:17,239
You got the key, right?

2001
02:22:20,053 --> 02:22:24,353
All right, now, when we get up in here,
you go up in here slow, all right?

2002
02:22:24,424 --> 02:22:26,585
I want you to keep your ass
in front of me.

2003
02:22:26,660 --> 02:22:29,720
Don't be fuckin' around
herky-jerky or nothin'.

2004
02:22:35,736 --> 02:22:38,671
Why it so dark in here?

2005
02:22:44,244 --> 02:22:48,271
Say, Jackie.
That you?

2006
02:22:48,348 --> 02:22:50,282
Yeah.

2007
02:22:55,288 --> 02:22:57,779
Goddamn, girl.

2008
02:22:57,858 --> 02:22:59,849
What you doin' sittin' off
in here in the dark?

2009
02:22:59,926 --> 02:23:04,158
Ray, he's got a gun!

2010
02:23:23,250 --> 02:23:25,775
He dead?

2011
02:23:25,852 --> 02:23:28,412
Yeah, he's dead.

2012
02:23:28,488 --> 02:23:31,582
Does he have the marked bills on him?

2013
02:23:31,658 --> 02:23:34,991
He oughta have 40,000
in his pocket there...

2014
02:23:35,062 --> 02:23:38,190
and maybe another 10,000
I gave him.

2015
02:23:38,265 --> 02:23:40,893
Whyd you give him $10,000?

2016
02:23:40,967 --> 02:23:42,935
Returned a bond collateral.

2017
02:23:43,003 --> 02:23:46,200
Brought it to him so he
wouldn't have to come here.

2018
02:23:47,274 --> 02:23:49,299
Well, how'd you know
where he was?

2019
02:23:49,376 --> 02:23:51,469
I found him.

2020
02:23:51,545 --> 02:23:54,537
- What do you mean you found him?
- That's my job.

2021
02:23:54,614 --> 02:23:58,914
- You guys didn't tell the police?
- I told Jackie.

2022
02:23:58,985 --> 02:24:01,715
She said you wanted him.

2023
02:24:01,788 --> 02:24:05,189
Ray?

2024
02:24:05,258 --> 02:24:09,024
Remember when you said you hoped
you'd get him before he gets me?

2025
02:24:11,531 --> 02:24:16,230
Well, you did.
Thanks.

2026
02:24:37,891 --> 02:24:40,917
Knock, knock.
Hey.

2027
02:24:43,063 --> 02:24:44,997
Hey, you.

2028
02:24:45,065 --> 02:24:47,431
I got your package.

2029
02:24:47,501 --> 02:24:50,436
It was fun gettin'
a half million dollars in the mail.

2030
02:24:50,504 --> 02:24:53,871
- Less ten percent.
- Why'd you take so little?

2031
02:24:53,940 --> 02:24:57,637
- That's my fee.
- This isn't a bail bond, Max.

2032
02:24:57,711 --> 02:25:01,340
- I-I hesitated takin' that much.
- Well, you earned it.

2033
02:25:03,750 --> 02:25:05,980
Well, I'm leavin' now, and, you know,
I'm all packed up, ready to go-

2034
02:25:06,052 --> 02:25:10,682
- That's Ordells.
- They confiscated everything else.

2035
02:25:10,757 --> 02:25:12,850
Registration was
in the glove box.

2036
02:25:12,926 --> 02:25:15,861
Keys were underneath the seat.
Hey.

2037
02:25:15,929 --> 02:25:19,865
What's the matter? Havent you
ever borrowed somebody's car before?

2038
02:25:19,933 --> 02:25:22,197
Not after they're dead.

2039
02:25:25,138 --> 02:25:27,368
I didn't use you, Max.

2040
02:25:29,109 --> 02:25:32,306
I didn't say you did.

2041
02:25:32,379 --> 02:25:34,540
And I never lied to you.

2042
02:25:34,614 --> 02:25:38,345
- I know that.
- We're partners.

2043
02:25:38,418 --> 02:25:43,355
I'm 56years old.
I can't blame anybody for anything I do.

2044
02:25:45,559 --> 02:25:48,551
Do you blame yourself
for helpin' me?

2045
02:25:48,628 --> 02:25:50,823
No.

2046
02:25:50,897 --> 02:25:53,593
Look, I'd really feel a whole lot better
if you took some more money.

2047
02:25:53,667 --> 02:25:57,330
You'll get over that.
Where you goin'?

2048
02:25:57,404 --> 02:26:00,237
- Spain.
- Madrid or Barcelona?

2049
02:26:00,307 --> 02:26:03,276
Mmm, Madrid first.
Have you been there?

2050
02:26:03,343 --> 02:26:07,404
- I hear they don't eat dinner until midnight.
- You wanna go?

2051
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:10,745
Thanks, but, uh,
you have a good time.

2052
02:26:10,817 --> 02:26:13,615
You sure
I can't twist your arm?

2053
02:26:13,687 --> 02:26:17,020
Thanks for sayin' that,
but no.

2054
02:26:17,090 --> 02:26:20,025
Are you scared of me?

2055
02:26:21,561 --> 02:26:23,495
A little bit.

2056
02:27:01,968 --> 02:27:04,562
I'll send you a postcard.

2057
02:27:04,638 --> 02:27:06,731
Will you?

2058
02:27:06,806 --> 02:27:09,240
I sure will, partner.

2059
02:27:27,961 --> 02:27:31,727
You're running a business, Max.

2060
02:27:31,798 --> 02:27:34,164
Cherry Bail Bond.

2061
02:27:36,269 --> 02:27:39,204
Uh, what is it
your son's charged with?

2062
02:27:51,051 --> 02:27:54,487
Yes, that's
a very serious offense.

2063
02:27:56,256 --> 02:27:59,282
Is your son still in school?

2064
02:27:59,359 --> 02:28:03,125
Does his father still live
in the house?

2065
02:28:05,231 --> 02:28:09,964
Could I excuse myself? Would you
call me back in about half an hour?

2066
02:28:14,708 --> 02:28:18,235
Yes, thank you.

2067
02:29:00,665 --> 02:29:03,862
#I was the third brother
of five #

2068
02:29:03,934 --> 02:29:08,735
#Doing whatever I had to do
to survive #

2069
02:29:08,806 --> 02:29:12,936
#I'm not saying what I did
was all right #

2070
02:29:13,010 --> 02:29:17,242
# Tryin ' to break out of the ghetto
was a day-to-day fight #

2071
02:29:17,314 --> 02:29:21,444
#Been down so long gettin ' up
didn't cross my mind #

2072
02:29:21,519 --> 02:29:26,252
#But I knew there was a better way
of life and I was just trying to find #

2073
02:29:26,323 --> 02:29:30,384
#But you don't know what you'll do
until youre put under pressure #

2074
02:29:30,461 --> 02:29:34,090
#Across 110th Street
is a hell of a tester #

2075
02:29:34,165 --> 02:29:38,033
#Across 110th Street #

2076
02:29:38,102 --> 02:29:42,698
#Pimps trying to catch
a woman that's weak #

2077
02:29:42,773 --> 02:29:46,675
#Across 110th Street #

2078
02:29:46,744 --> 02:29:51,477
#Pushers won't let
the junkie go free #

2079
02:29:51,549 --> 02:29:56,248
#Across 110th Street #

2080
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:59,346
#Woman tryin' to catch
a trick on the street #

2081

#Ooh, baby
Across 110th Street #

2082
02:30:05,496 --> 02:30:09,398
#You can find it all
in the street #

2083
02:30:25,049 --> 02:30:28,985
#I got one more thing I'd like
to talk to y'all about right now #

2084
02:30:30,621 --> 02:30:35,024
#Hey, brother
There's a better way out #

2085
02:30:35,092 --> 02:30:39,392
#Snorting that coke, shooting that dope
Man, you're copping out #

2086
02:30:39,463 --> 02:30:43,456
#Take my advice
It's either live or die #

2087
02:30:43,534 --> 02:30:47,732
#You got to be strong
if you want to survive #

2088
02:30:47,805 --> 02:30:51,901
#The family
on the upper side of town #

2089
02:30:51,976 --> 02:30:56,640
#Will catch hell
without a ghetto around #

2090
02:30:56,714 --> 02:31:00,980
#In every city you find
the same thing goin ' down #

2091
02:31:01,051 --> 02:31:04,111
#Harlem is the capital
of every ghetto town #

2092
02:31:04,188 --> 02:31:08,921
#Let me sing it
Across 110th Street #
