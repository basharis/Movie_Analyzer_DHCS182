00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,518
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,489
In the great Gold Rush, Alaska
was the hope and dream of men,

4
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,241
the ruthless siren
of the Far North,

5
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,326
beckoning thousands
to her icy bosom.

6
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,745
Beckoning thousands
to her unknown regions.

7
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,915
Chilkoot Pass was the great barrier
to the gold fields.

8
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,668
Over this Pass men faced
untold misery and hardship.

9
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,588
Many lost their lives.
Some fell by the wayside,

10
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,506
others lost courage
and turned back.

11
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,843
But the brave went on.

12
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,265
Far into the icy north,
deep into the silent nowhere,

13
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:42,728
came an undaunted lone prospector.

14
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:34,613
And somewhere in that nowhere
was another lone prospector.

15
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,663
With cheerful optimism
our little Columbus descended,

16
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:47,417
then stopped, stepped,
slipped and slid.

17
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,934
"Now let me see",
thought the little fellow.

18
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,729
"Before I know where I am,
I must get there."

19
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,231
There in that frozen wilderness
a dream came true,

20
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,901
and a lone voice shrieked
into the solemn sky,

21
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:59,823
"Eureka! I've found it,
a mountain of gold!"

22
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:09,333
But the elements laughed,
roared and thundered.

23
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,254
In that raging nowhere
was a lone cabin,

24
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,507
and another lone man,
Black Larson,

25
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,594
an unmitigated,
predatory scoundrel.

26
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,717
Out of the lashing storm
came the Little Fellow

27
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:05,889
to find shelter and perhaps
a little hospitality.

28
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,776
There he sat,
resting his weary bones

29
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,489
as the icy wind howled
through the knothole.

30
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,856
"Come here", said Larson.

31
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,774
"What are you doing?"

32
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,526
"Eating, obviously."

33
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,362
"Get out."

34
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,582
"Go on!"

35
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,044
"Get out!"

36
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,722
The wind also was giving
Big Jim his troubles.

37
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,770
Big Jim was the noble type.
He had suffered.

38
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,317
Oh, how he loved to suffer.
He suffered about everything.

39
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,884
"Get out", said Black Larson.

40
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:51,180
"Or I'll fill you both
full of lead."

41
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,397
"Now then,
the pair of you, get out!"

42
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,399
"Out!"

43
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:07,237
That kind of noise
Jim don't tolerate.

44
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,540
"I'll stay right here, understand?"

45
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,459
"Right here", said Big Jim.

46
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,756
"Yes, sir, he'll stay right here",
said the Little Fellow.

47
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:18,600
"Understand? We stay right here."

48
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,897
And stay they did,

49
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,733
for days and nights.
The cabin moaned and groaned.

50
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:32,030
Two men walked and never talked,
hunger gnawed their bones.

51
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,665
"I must have food!" yelled Big Jim.

52
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,377
"I must have food!"

53
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,293
"What are you eating?"
Said Black Larson.

54
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,461
"Nothing."

55
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,380
"Open your mouth!"

56
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,893
"Liar! It's that candle."

57
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:47,689
"That?" said the Little Fellow.
"How revolting."

58
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,988
"If I thought you were holding out
on me, I'd slit your gizzard!"

59
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:28,689
"One of us must brave that storm,
if we're to get food."

60
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,693
"Come here, the pair of you."

61
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:37,114
"We'll cut the cards
and the low man goes."

62
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,008
"You're the man", said Jim.

63
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,140
"Goodbye, good luck."

64
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,311
"Don't forget
to bring home the bacon."

65
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:36,757
Somewhere in that nowhere,
the law was looking for Black Larson.

66
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:41,071
Desperate with hunger
and here it was Thanksgiving Day.

67
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,617
Nevertheless there was something
to be thankful for.

68
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,920
"Not quite done yet,
give it two more minutes."

69
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,299
"Come on, come on", said Big Jim.

70
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,834
After scouring the country for food,

71
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,420
the Little Fellow had to admit
he had seen nothing,

72
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,090
not even a field mouse.

73
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,600
From the pangs of hunger,

74
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,186
Big Jim was becoming delirious,
hysterical.

75
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,522
In fact he was a pain in the neck.

76
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:05,817
"Food, food!" he thundered.

77
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,111
"I can put another shoe in the pot."

78
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:12,282
"No, no, anything but that!"

79
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,704
Poor Jim, he couldn't take it.

80
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,506
"What's the matter?"
Said the Little Fellow.

81
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,302
"I thought you were a chicken."

82
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:24,980
"Well, build up the fire",
said Big Jim.

83
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:49,379
"What's the matter with you?"
Said the Little Fellow.

84
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,798
"Come, my pretty bird",
said Big Jim.

85
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:55,010
"Don't be childish."

86
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:09,399
"Hey, quit it.
Don't be foolish, it's me!"

87
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,320
"You!" said Jim.

88
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,239
"I'm sorry. I must be crazy."

89
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:19,576
"You're telling me",
said the Little Fellow.

90
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:26,583
"You go inside. I'll take the gun
in case you lose it."

91
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,779
Chicken or no chicken,

92
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:00,242
the Little Fellow looks appetizing
to Big Jim.

93
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:50,454
Meanwhile Black Larson stumbled
onto Big Jim's mountain of gold.

94
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,468
Then came the parting of the ways,

95
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:07,888
Big Jim to his mine,
our hero to his fate.

96
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,389
"Goodbye", said the Little Fellow.

97
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,393
"It's been a great pleasure
knowing you."

98
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:32,746
Treachery awaited Big Jim
at his mountain of gold.

99
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,428
Big Jim looked deep into the eyes

100
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:50,430
of Black Larson

101
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:54,268
and saw there the soul of a skunk.

102
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,874
Caught in a maelstrom
of desperate deeds,

103
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:21,503
Black Larson swept on
to impending doom.

104
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:45,736
And out of a dream
in that frozen waste, a city grew.

105
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:50,699
And humanity warmed it with living,
loving and desiring.

106
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:57,664
Georgia.

107
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:13,430
Jack was a ladies' man.

108
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,932
Georgia was quick and impulsive,

109
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:18,352
proud and independent.

110
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:36,620
In the evening Georgia worked
as a dancehall girl.

111
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,309
Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia.

112
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,188
Perhaps that's why she resented him.

113
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,176
Out of the night
came the Little Fellow,

114
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:35,262
towards the dancehall,
that beacon light of pleasure,

115
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:39,141
that retreat of lost dreams.

116
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:30,127
"Georgia,
why aren't you nice to Jack?"

117
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:33,380
"I believe he really likes you",
said the girl.

118
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,716
"He likes everybody",
said Georgia quite audibly.

119
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,302
"I'm bored with this place",
she continued.

120
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:43,765
"I'd give it all up if I could find
someone honest and worthwhile."

121
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:50,272
"Don't worry,
I'll find him someday."

122
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:51,815
Then she turned

123
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,902
and looked and looked

124
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:58,280
and looked.

125
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,166
"Kinda fresh, ain't ya?"
Thought Jack.

126
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,584
"Get down off that high horse."

127
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,420
"Me and you are gonna dance."

128
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,048
"Hey there, pan out a tune."

129
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:45,512
"Just a moment,
I said we're gonna dance."

130
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,514
"I beg your pardon", said Georgia.

131
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,183
To show her utter contempt for Jack,

132
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:53,270
she picked out the most deplorable
looking tramp in the dancehall.

133
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,523
"Hey you, come here."

134
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:02,112
"Yes, you. Do you want to dance?"

135
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:09,620
"You see, I'm very particular
about whom I dance with."

136
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:51,949
And there he stood,
the dauntless cavalier, guarding...

137
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:55,035
her sanctuary.

138
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,659
"If you wanna make a hit
with your lady friend",

139
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,164
"you should put your hat
on straight, like this!"

140
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:43,834
"Take that you... Ouch!"

141
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:54,678
"Huh! Very good."

142
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:58,849
"Didn't know me own strength",
said the Little Fellow.

143
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:27,044
Hank Curtis' cabin was
a stone's throw from the dancehall.

144
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:29,796
Hank was a mining engineer
who lived alone

145
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:31,298
and occasionally went
on long expeditions

146
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:32,466
into the Far North.

147
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,218
Hank was kind and human,

148
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:36,136
and our hero cold and hungry,

149
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:39,014
and the beans smelled good
and the coffee was steaming hot.

150
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:44,269
So the Little Fellow
devised a way of getting breakfast.

151
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,377
Big Jim recovered from the blow
he received from Black Larson

152
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:35,672
but lost his memory.

153
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:55,067
Hank's partner arrives.

154
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:57,528
Both are ready to leave
on a long expedition.

155
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:59,947
Hank informs his partner
that the Little Fellow

156
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:03,992
is to look after the cabin
while he's away.

157
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:11,208
"Goodbye", said Hank.
"And don't forget to feed the mule."

158
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:42,531
Since that night in the dancehall
the Little Fellow hadn't seen Georgia,

159
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:46,952
but an incident
was to bring them together again.

160
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:41,965
There she stood,
her loveliness lighting the room,

161
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:43,800
filling his soul
with the music of romance

162
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:45,636
for which he was so ill-fitted.

163
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:50,682
As she introduced her friends,
his heart began to sing.

164
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:09,159
As they warmed up by the stove,
he excused himself to get firewood.

165
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,865
And in that cabin
his secret was revealed,

166
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,533
his love for Georgia.

167
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,785
And the girls giggled and laughed,

168
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,787
perhaps in order to hide their pity.

169
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:56,456
For in the world of the dancehall
it wasn't wise for the girls

170
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:58,083
to reveal their hearts.

171
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:03,046
And so they thought
they'd have a little fun with him.

172
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,386
There in the gloaming they sat,

173
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:12,139
their faces alight with mischief,

174
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:16,518
but all the while
his heart was singing.

175
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:41,877
And so she fooled and flirted
and stroked his hair.

176
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,463
He knew she was fooling,
but he was happy.

177
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:47,174
For she was near him,
holding his hand,

178
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:50,385
smiling at him.

179
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:00,646
"Nice place you have here",
said Georgia.

180
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:02,981
"I hope you will invite us again."

181
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:04,274
What if she were fooling?

182
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,777
He was enjoying
the warmth of her attention.

183
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:11,073
And the lady was enjoying
the warmth of his chair.

184
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:34,972
And now she was leaving.

185
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:37,140
The light of her loveliness
would be gone.

186
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:39,142
And he would be left
with an emptiness,

187
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:41,812
to return to his bleak,
lonely existence.

188
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:43,230
"Pardon me",
said the Little Fellow,

189
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,943
"But, uh..."
He was lost for words.

190
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,404
"Would you really like
to come again?"

191
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:53,407
"Of course", said Georgia.
"What do you say, girls?"

192
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:55,993
"We'll come for dinner
New Year's Eve", said the ladies.

193
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:57,244
"Very well", said Georgia.

194
00:42:57,494 --> 00:43:01,290
"We'll come to dinner
New Year's Eve."

195
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:04,978
Of course at that moment
Georgia would forget her gloves!

196
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:26,166
For the next few days the Little
Fellow hustled and shoveled

197
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:30,212
in order to buy
that New Year's dinner.

198
00:45:55,422 --> 00:46:00,928
The eve of a new year.
New hopes and new dreams.

199
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,983
And there was Georgia, caressing him
with her smiles and tender glances.

200
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:22,569
And the girls called for a speech.

201
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,238
But he was too happy to speak.

202
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:27,491
All that mattered
was Georgia was there. Georgia!

203
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:30,160
So he muttered and stuttered
and finally said,

204
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,496
"I can't make a speech
but I'll do a dance."

205
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:36,708
And a dance he did, with the rolls.

206
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:53,136
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

207
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:59,309
<i>And never brought to mind</i>

208
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,982
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

209
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:11,238
<i>And days of auld lang syne</i>

210
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:17,661
<i>For auld lang syne
My dear</i>

211
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:22,332
<i>For auld lang...</i>

212
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:13,050
In the midst of all their revelry
the vague memory

213
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,470
of a promise crept
into Georgia's mind.

214
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,641
"Let's go up and visit
the Little Fellow", she said.

215
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:00,013
"We'll have some fun
with him", said Jack.

216
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:04,393
"We'll send Georgia in first,
then give him a scare."

217
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:00,324
"Oh, forget it", said Jack.

218
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:04,453
"How about giving me
a little attention?"

219
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:26,767
A day or so later
in the Recorder's office,

220
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:28,936
Big Jim tried to convince
the assayers

221
00:54:29,186 --> 00:54:32,606
that he had a mountain of gold.

222
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,194
"Where is this place?" they said.

223
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:39,780
But Big Jim's memory
had failed him.

224
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:44,159
All he knew was
that it was near the cabin.

225
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,792
"The cabin, that's it!"

226
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:56,129
"F I could find my way to the cabin
I could find the mine."

227
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,591
"But I can't remember."

228
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:16,900
"Hey!" said Jack,
"Georgia's been looking for you."

229
00:55:17,151 --> 00:55:18,152
The Little Fellow knew otherwise.

230
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:21,155
How dare that cad mention
her name so lightly?

231
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:23,323
For two pins
he'd give him another thrashing.

232
00:55:23,574 --> 00:55:28,912
However being a little underweight
he would ignore the insult.

233
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:43,343
But it was true.
Georgia had been looking for him.

234
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:46,305
Georgia had written him a letter.

235
00:56:05,866 --> 00:56:11,538
And as he went looking for Georgia,
so Big Jim went looking for him.

236
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:22,299
"You, you!" said Big Jim.

237
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:28,055
"You! The very man
I've been looking for!"

238
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:30,390
"The cabin, the cabin! Where is it?"

239
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:31,975
"Answer me, I say!"

240
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:35,145
"Can't you speak, man? Tell me!"

241
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:38,315
"Where's the cabin? Where is it?"

242
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,818
"At last I shall find
my mountain of gold."

243
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:42,653
"To your feet man, quick!"

244
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:44,238
"You're coming with me!"

245
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:49,660
"Take me to the cabin
and I'll make you a millionaire!"

246
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:55,874
"Georgia! Just a moment",
said the Little Fellow.

247
00:57:01,672 --> 00:57:04,174
"Georgia, you don't have to explain.
I understand."

248
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:06,343
"I love you.
I'll take you away from this life."

249
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:08,345
"I'm going away, and when I return",

250
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:11,515
"I shall come back."

251
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:26,530
Exhausted and footweary,
they arrived at the cabin.

252
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:31,451
"Ah!" said Big Jim,
"it won't be long now."

253
00:57:31,702 --> 00:57:35,622
"Bring in the eats and tomorrow
we'll start for the mine.

254
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:40,419
"Here, take a swig of this.
It'll put hair on your topcoat."

255
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:20,292
"My, this is a heavy lamb chop",
said the Little fellow.

256
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:24,481
Then fate - it's always fate -
played its little joke,

257
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:27,484
and again the elements laughed,
roared and thundered,

258
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:32,156
but through it all
our heroes soundly slumbered.

259
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:54,553
Then came the dawn.

260
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:01,268
The Little Fellow awoke,

261
01:00:01,518 --> 01:00:03,520
blissfully ignorant
of what happened the night before,

262
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:08,734
but feeling definitely conscious
of "the morning after".

263
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:28,670
"Oh well, may as well tidy up
and get breakfast."

264
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:56,615
"This is the worst liver attack
I've ever had."

265
01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:10,003
"Feel that rocking?"

266
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:12,923
"It's the stomach."

267
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,101
"It's not the stomach."

268
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:20,491
"Let's go to the other side."

269
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:23,660
"We'll see how far it
will go over."

270
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:50,979
"Something
must be missing underneath."

271
01:02:51,772 --> 01:02:55,400
"I'll go outside
and see what it is."

272
01:03:48,662 --> 01:03:50,497
"Now", said Big Jim,
"don't get excited."

273
01:03:50,747 --> 01:03:55,711
"Take it easy, don't move,
don't breathe!"

274
01:03:57,588 --> 01:04:02,217
"I said don't breathe, stupid."

275
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:09,558
"You can be most annoying
at times."

276
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:13,270
"If you'll only be cool, be calm",
said Big Jim,

277
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,732
"We have nothing to worry about."

278
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:33,832
"Now show a little character!
Where's your willpower?"

279
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:41,298
"Now listen,
I've got a very good idea."

280
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:45,052
"Hold your hands like this,
then I can get out first."

281
01:05:09,576 --> 01:05:11,161
"You see what I mean?"
Said Big Jim.

282
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:13,997
"Your mind is chaotic.
You have no psychology."

283
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:17,501
"You have no control."

284
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:39,898
And Big Jim discovered his claim!

285
01:06:16,143 --> 01:06:18,061
"Now we shall be rich", said Jim.

286
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:20,731
"We shall be millionaires!"

287
01:06:20,981 --> 01:06:23,609
And so they were.

288
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:46,423
Now they were homeward bound

289
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:49,092
and they were leaving the hardship
and toil of Alaska

290
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:50,844
to live in the land
of milk and honey.

291
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:53,847
To live, laugh and indulge themselves
in the lap of luxury.

292
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:58,310
They were famous,
and sought after by the press.

293
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:05,108
In their cabin deluxe

294
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:09,071
they were welcomed
and waited upon.

295
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:28,966
The reporter wanted to write
the Little Fellow's life story,

296
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:33,178
"From Rags to Riches",
and he graciously consented.

297
01:07:45,399 --> 01:07:46,817
And Big Jim was manicured.

298
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:51,071
"Not the nails", said he,
"the corns".

299
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:53,907
The reporter thought of a good idea,

300
01:07:54,158 --> 01:07:56,326
to have the Little Fellow pose
in his mining clothes.

301
01:07:56,577 --> 01:07:59,997
It would make a human story.

302
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:10,465
Georgia...

303
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:24,855
There she was in the steerage.
Neither knew of the other's presence.

304
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:29,818
Georgia overheard the officer say
there was a stowaway aboard.

305
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:01,618
"You!" said Georgia.

306
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:04,037
"I thought I'd never see you again."

307
01:10:04,288 --> 01:10:07,624
And then she mistook him
for the stowaway.

308
01:10:22,556 --> 01:10:24,391
The officer was going
to put him in irons.

309
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:29,188
But Georgia pleaded for him
and said she would pay his fare.

310
01:10:37,488 --> 01:10:39,239
"Heck!" said the Captain.
"That's no stowaway."

311
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:43,702
"That's Big Jim's partner,
the multimillionaire."

312
01:10:44,161 --> 01:10:47,581
Then of course there were apologies.

313
01:10:47,831 --> 01:10:49,666
The Little Fellow
gathered himself together.

314
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:54,379
James, the valet, was told
to prepare for an extra guest.

315
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:05,933
"Pardon me", said the reporter,
"but who's the lady?"

316
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:07,601
"Buzz buzz buzz!"

317
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:10,187
"Oh, you don't say!
Well, congratulations."

318
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:14,900
"This will make a great story,
and with a happy ending."

319
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:16,276
And so it was.

320
01:11:16,527 --> 01:11:19,488
A happy ending.

321
