1
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:55,010
Do you have any idea
what they were arguing about?

2
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:57,645
Do you speak English?

3
00:03:57,913 --> 00:03:58,743
Yeah.

4
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:01,679
No. I'm sorry,
my German is not very good.

5
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,590
Have you heard that
as couples get older

6
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,259
they lose their ability
to hear each other?

7
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:12,611
No.

8
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:17,198
Supposedly, men lose their ability
to hear high-pitched sounds...

9
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,390
and women lose hearing
in the low end.

10
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:22,201
I guess they nullify each other.

11
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:25,567
I guess. Nature's way of allowing
couples to grow old together...

12
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:27,639
without killing each other.

13
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,144
What are you reading?

14
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:33,511
Oh, yeah.

15
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:35,767
How about you?

16
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:56,459
I was thinking about going
to the lounge car.

17
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:59,706
- Would you like to come with me?
- Yeah.

18
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:01,907
Okay.

19
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:23,420
How do you speak such good English?

20
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:26,293
I went to school for a summer
in Los Angeles.

21
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:29,064
- It's fine here?
- Yeah, this is good.

22
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:32,239
And I spent some time in London.

23
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:36,205
- Wow.
- How do you speak such good English?

24
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,071
Me? I'm American.

25
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,348
- You're American? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

26
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,576
No, I'm joking.
I knew you were American.

27
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,413
And you don't speak
any other language, right?

28
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,888
Yeah, yeah.
I get it, I get it.

29
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,287
I'm the crude, dumb,
vulgar American...

30
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:58,227
who doesn't speak other languages,
who has no culture. But I tried.

31
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:02,062
I took French in high school.
When I first got to Paris...

32
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,635
I stood in line
at the metro station.

33
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:06,032
I was practicing.

34
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:11,861
Whatever.

35
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,475
And I get up there,
and I look at this woman...

36
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:23,622
and my mind goes blank. And I say,
"I need a ticket to get to..."

37
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:25,291
So anyway...

38
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,521
So where are you headed?

39
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:30,792
Well, back to Paris.

40
00:06:30,997 --> 00:06:34,297
- My classes start next week.
- You're still in school? Where?

41
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:36,592
La Sorbonne. You know?

42
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:37,954
Sure.

43
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,397
You're coming from Budapest?

44
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:44,634
- I was visiting my grandmother.
- Oh. How is she?

45
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,369
She's okay.

46
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,741
- She's all right?
- She's fine.

47
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:54,082
- How about you? Where are you going?
- I'm going to Vienna.

48
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:55,437
Vienna?
What's there?

49
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,817
No idea.
I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

50
00:06:58,024 --> 00:06:59,583
You're on holiday?

51
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:06,155
I don't really know what I'm on.
You know?

52
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:10,663
I've just been traveling around,
riding trains for two or three weeks.

53
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,771
You were visiting friends
or just on your own?

54
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:16,497
I had a friend in Madrid, but...

55
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:19,233
- Madrid, that's nice.
- I got a Eurail pass...

56
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,595
is what I did.

57
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:21,897
That's great.

58
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:26,650
So has this trip around Europe
been good for you?

59
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:29,753
Yeah, sure. It's been...
It sucked.

60
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:31,650
What?

61
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:34,875
It's had its...

62
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,597
I'll tell you, sitting for weeks on end
looking out the window...

63
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:41,061
has actually been kind of great.

64
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:44,092
What do you mean?

65
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,037
Well, you know, for instance...

66
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,675
you have ideas that you
ordinarily wouldn't have.

67
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:52,902
- What kind of ideas?
- Want to hear one?

68
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:55,103
- Tell me.
- All right.

69
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:58,249
I have this idea, okay,
for a television show.

70
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,146
Some friends of mine
are cable-access producers.

71
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:02,944
Do you know what that is?

72
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:08,189
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,
and they have to put it on.

73
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:12,557
I have this idea for a show that lasts
24 hours a day for a year straight.

74
00:08:12,764 --> 00:08:13,991
What you do is you get...

75
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:18,532
365 people from cities
all over the world...

76
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:21,728
to do these 24-hour documents
of real time.

77
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:24,533
Capturing life as it's lived.

78
00:08:24,743 --> 00:08:28,701
You know, it would start with a guy
waking up in the morning...

79
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:30,937
and taking the long shower...

80
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:34,879
eating a little breakfast,
making a little coffee...

81
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:36,236
reading the paper...

82
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:38,479
Wait. All those mundane,
boring things...

83
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:41,715
everybody has to do every day
of their fucking life?

84
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:44,019
I was going to say,
"The poetry of day-to-day life."

85
00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:46,720
You say it your way.
I'll say it my way.

86
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:48,921
- Think of it like this...
- Who's gonna watch?

87
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:53,263
Think about it like this. Why is it
that a dog sleeping in the sun...

88
00:08:53,637 --> 00:08:56,129
is so beautiful?
It is. It's beautiful.

89
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,933
But a guy taking money
from a bank machine...

90
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:01,168
looks like a complete moron?

91
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:05,577
<i>So it's like a National Geographic
program, but on people.</i>

92
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:06,933
Yeah.

93
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:08,650
What do you think?

94
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:12,721
Yeah, I can see it.
Like, 24 boring hours... Sorry...

95
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:16,381
and a three-minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after.

96
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:20,629
Yeah, and that would
be a great episode.

97
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,230
People would talk about that episode.

98
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,301
You and your friends could
do one in Paris if you wanted.

99
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:32,305
I don't know. The key, the thing
that haunts me is the distribution.

100
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,446
Getting these tapes from town to town
so it would play continuously.

101
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:41,310
Because it would have to play all
the time, or it just wouldn't work.

102
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:43,483
Thank you.

103
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:46,171
Thanks.

104
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:50,791
You know what?
Not service oriented.

105
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:54,761
Just an observation about Europe.

106
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:05,971
My parents never really
spoke of the possibility...

107
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:09,736
of my falling in love or
getting married or having children.

108
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:12,077
Even as a little girl...

109
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:15,739
they wanted me to think as
a future career as a, you know...

110
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:19,149
interior designer or lawyer
or something like that.

111
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:22,154
I'd say to my dad,
"I want to be a writer."

112
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:24,087
And he'd say, "Journalist."

113
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:28,821
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for
stray cats. He'd say, "Veterinarian."

114
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:32,660
I'd say I wanted to be an actress.
He'd say, "TV newscaster."

115
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:36,860
It was this constant conversion
of my fanciful ambition into these...

116
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:39,403
practical moneymaking ventures.

117
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:44,237
I had a good bullshit detector
when I was a kid.

118
00:10:44,446 --> 00:10:46,937
I always knew
when they were lying to me.

119
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:49,174
By high school, I was dead set...

120
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:53,582
on listening to what everybody
thought I should do with my life...

121
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,586
and doing the opposite.

122
00:10:56,692 --> 00:11:01,356
Nobody was ever mean about it.
I just could never get very excited...

123
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:04,725
about other people's ambitions
for my life.

124
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,963
But you know what?
If your parents never...

125
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:11,833
fully contradict you about anything
and are nice and supportive...

126
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,189
Right.

127
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:16,337
It makes it even harder
to officially complain.

128
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:20,412
Even when they're wrong,
it's this passive-aggressive shit.

129
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:22,014
You know what I mean?

130
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:23,479
I hate it.

131
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:25,477
I really hate it.

132
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,486
Well, you know, despite all that
kind of bullshit...

133
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,351
that comes along with it...

134
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:34,724
I remember childhood as...

135
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:37,621
this magical time.

136
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:42,769
I do. I remember when my mother
first told me about death.

137
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:47,735
My great-grandmother had died, and my
family had visited them in Florida.

138
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:50,000
I was about 3, 31/2 years old.

139
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,645
Anyway, I was in
the back yard playing...

140
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:57,443
and my sister had just taught me
how to take the garden hose...

141
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,812
and do it in such a way that...

142
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,783
it sprayed into the sun
and would make a rainbow.

143
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,157
And so I was doing that...

144
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:10,522
and through the mist,
I could see my grandmother.

145
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,029
And she was just standing there,
smiling at me.

146
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:17,396
And I held it there for a long time...

147
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,401
and I looked at her.

148
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,871
And then finally, I let go
of the nozzle, you know?

149
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,044
And then I dropped the hose...

150
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,971
and she disappeared.

151
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,543
And so I run back inside
and tell my parents.

152
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:35,253
And they sit me down
and give me this big rap on how...

153
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,550
when people die, you never see
them again, and how I'd imagined it.

154
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,285
But I knew what I'd seen.
I was glad I saw that.

155
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:47,456
I've never seen anything
like that since. But I don't know.

156
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,728
It just kind of let me know
how ambiguous everything was.

157
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,371
Even death.

158
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:58,039
You're lucky you can have
this attitude toward death.

159
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,910
I think I'm afraid of death
24 hours a day.

160
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,552
I swear. I mean, that's why
I'm in a train right now.

161
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,414
I could've flown to Paris,
but I'm scared.

162
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,921
- Oh, come on.
- I can't help it.

163
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,525
I know the statistics say,
"Na, Na, Na, it's safer." Whatever.

164
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:18,856
When I'm in a plane,
I can see the explosion.

165
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,362
I can see me falling
through the clouds.

166
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,832
And I'm so scared of those
few seconds of consciousness...

167
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,439
before you die.
When you know you're gonna die.

168
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,643
I can't stop thinking that way.

169
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,280
It's exhausting.

170
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,039
Yeah, I bet.

171
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:40,047
Really exhausting.

172
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,422
- I think this is Vienna.
- Yeah.

173
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,458
- You get off here, no?
- Yeah, what a drag.

174
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:54,365
I wish I'd met you earlier.
I really like talking to you.

175
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,898
Yeah, me too.

176
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,830
It was really nice of you too.

177
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:34,934
I have an admittedly insane idea,
but if I don't ask you this...

178
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,163
it'll haunt me the rest of my life.

179
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,525
What?

180
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:46,078
I want to keep talking to you.
I have no idea what your situation is...

181
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,018
but I feel like we have
some kind of...

182
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:50,653
connection. Right?

183
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:52,037
Yeah. Me too.

184
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,255
Right. Great.
Here's the deal.

185
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,859
Get off here in Vienna
and come check out the town.

186
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,722
- What?
- Come on. It'll be fun.

187
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:01,860
- Come on.
- What would we do?

188
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:06,661
I don't know. All I know is I catch
a flight tomorrow morning at 9:30...

189
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,237
and I can't afford a hotel,
so I was going to walk around...

190
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,306
and it'd be more fun
if you came with me.

191
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:16,240
And if I turn out to be a psycho,
just get on the next train.

192
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,677
All right, all right.
Think of it like this.

193
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:23,778
Jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?

194
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:25,148
And you're married.

195
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:29,188
Only your marriage doesn't have
that same energy it used to have.

196
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,388
You start to blame your husband.

197
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:34,530
You think about all those guys
you've met in your life...

198
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,394
and what might've happened
if you'd picked up with one of them.

199
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:40,593
I'm one of those guys.
That's me.

200
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:42,668
So think of this as time travel...

201
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:46,808
from then to now to find out
what you're missing out on.

202
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,307
What this could be is
a gigantic favor...

203
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:53,142
to you and your husband to find out
you're not missing anything.

204
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,341
I'm just as big a loser as he is.
Unmotivated. Boring.

205
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,179
You made the right choice.
You're happy.

206
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:07,524
Let me get my bag.

207
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:36,321
We should get a locker for all this.

208
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:42,557
What's your name?

209
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:43,915
My name?

210
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:47,627
Jesse. James, actually,
but everybody calls me Jesse.

211
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:49,997
You mean, Jesse James, no?

212
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:51,503
No. No, just Jesse.

213
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:52,856
I'm Celine.

214
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,881
This is a nice bridge.

215
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,352
Yeah.

216
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:16,288
This is kind of weird.

217
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:19,227
Isn't it? I mean,
I feel a little awkward.

218
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:23,232
- But it's all right. Right?
- Yeah, this is great.

219
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:27,204
- Let's go to some places.
- Yeah, let's go to some places.

220
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:28,897
- Let's ask these guys.
- Okay.

221
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:31,476
Excuse me. Excuse me?

222
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:33,407
Do you speak English?

223
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:37,073
- Yes, of course.
- Do you speak German for a change?

224
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:39,082
- What?
- No, it was a joke.

225
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:43,086
We just got into Vienna today, and
we're looking for something fun to do.

226
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,019
Like museums, exhibitions...

227
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:48,662
But museums are not that
funny anymore these days.

228
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:53,162
They are closing right now.
How long are you going to be here?

229
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:54,562
Just for tonight.

230
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:57,903
Why did you come to Vienna?
What could you be expecting?

231
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,106
We're on honeymoon.

232
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,402
Yeah, she got pregnant,
we had to get married...

233
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:08,080
I don't believe you.
You're a bad liar.

234
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:17,956
This is a play we're both in.
We would like to invite you.

235
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:19,454
You're actors?

236
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,855
Not professional.
Part-time for fun.

237
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:25,190
It's a play about a cow and
Indians searching for it.

238
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:27,958
There are also
politicians, Mexicans...

239
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:30,101
Russians, communists...

240
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:34,266
- You have a real cow on stage?
- No, an actor in a cow costume.

241
00:18:34,473 --> 00:18:36,373
- He's the cow.
- Yes, I am the cow.

242
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:39,705
- And the cow's a bit weird.
- The cow has a disease.

243
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:42,312
She's acting a bit strange.
Like a dog.

244
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,142
If someone throws a stick,
she fetches it.

245
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:48,581
And she can smoke with hoofs
and everything.

246
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:51,611
- Great.
- As you see, there is the address.

247
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:53,553
It's in the second district.

248
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,351
Near the Prater. You know it?

249
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:58,495
The big Ferris wheel?
We should go. We should.

250
00:18:58,699 --> 00:19:01,223
Perhaps you can go to the Prater
before the play.

251
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:04,267
It starts at 2130.

252
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:06,763
- 2130?
- It's at 9:30.

253
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:08,997
- 9:30.
- Oh, right.

254
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:10,935
What's the name of this play?

255
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:15,238
It translates as "Bring Me the Horns
of Wilmington's Cow."

256
00:19:15,448 --> 00:19:16,598
I'm Wilmington's cow.

257
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:18,516
- All right.
- Great.

258
00:19:18,718 --> 00:19:19,868
- You'll be there?
- We'll try.

259
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:21,815
I'm the cow.

260
00:19:22,054 --> 00:19:23,204
Goodbye.

261
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,072
I got an idea. Are you ready?

262
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:48,940
It's Q and A time.
We've known each other a little while.

263
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:53,139
We're stuck together, so we'll ask
each other a few direct questions.

264
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:54,568
All right?

265
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:58,754
- We ask each other questions?
- And you have to answer honestly.

266
00:19:58,957 --> 00:20:00,720
- Of course.
- Okay.

267
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:02,723
All right, first question.

268
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:05,122
- You.
- Yes, I am going to ask you.

269
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,061
Describe for me your
first sexual feelings...

270
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:11,360
towards a person.

271
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:14,603
My first sexual feelings?
Oh, my God.

272
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,569
I know. I know.

273
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:20,505
Jean-Marc Fleury.

274
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:22,872
Jean-Marc Fleury?

275
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:27,113
We were at this summer camp together,
and he was a swimmer.

276
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:30,721
He had bleached-out
chlorine hair and green eyes...

277
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:34,187
and to improve his times,
he'd shave his legs and arms.

278
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:37,827
- That's disgusting.
- He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

279
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,258
My friend Emma
had a big crush on him.

280
00:20:40,464 --> 00:20:43,900
So one day, I was cutting across
the field back to my room...

281
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:46,831
and he came walking up beside me.
I told him...

282
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,438
"You should date Emma.
She has a big crush on you."

283
00:20:50,641 --> 00:20:52,200
And he turned to me and said...

284
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:56,277
"Well, that's too bad, because
I have a big crush on you."

285
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,643
So, yeah, it really scared
the hell out of me...

286
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,045
because I thought he was so fine.

287
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:07,223
Then he officially asked me on a date.
I pretended I didn't like him.

288
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:12,762
You know, I was so afraid of
what I might do, you know.

289
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,866
So I went to see him swim
a few times at the competition.

290
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,094
And he was so sexy. Really.
I mean, really sexy.

291
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:25,799
We wrote these little declarations
of love at the end of the summer...

292
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,410
and, you know, promised we would
keep writing forever...

293
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:31,877
and meet again very soon and...

294
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:33,231
Did you?

295
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:34,847
Of course not.

296
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:39,914
Then this is the opportune time
to tell you I'm a fantastic swimmer.

297
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,720
- Really?
- Yeah.

298
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,958
- I make note of that.
- Okay.

299
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:47,629
- So it's my turn. No?
- Yes, your turn.

300
00:21:47,829 --> 00:21:49,059
Hit me.

301
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:52,764
Have you ever been in love?

302
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:55,534
Yes.

303
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:56,888
Next question.

304
00:21:57,573 --> 00:21:59,130
- What was the...
- Wait a minute.

305
00:21:59,342 --> 00:22:01,708
- So I can give one-word answers?
- Why not?

306
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:04,777
After I went into detail
about my sexual feelings?

307
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:09,440
They're different questions. I could
answer the sexual-feelings thing.

308
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:13,348
But, you know, love... I mean,
what if I asked you about love?

309
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:17,321
I would have lied, but at least
I would have made up a great story.

310
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:20,120
Love is a complex issue, you know?

311
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:25,061
I mean, yes, I've told somebody
that I love them, and I've meant it.

312
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:28,498
But was it totally unselfish,
giving love?

313
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:30,603
Was it a beautiful thing?

314
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:33,866
Not really.
You know, it's like, love...

315
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:36,273
I mean, I don't know.

316
00:22:36,912 --> 00:22:38,062
You know?

317
00:22:39,014 --> 00:22:42,609
- Yeah. I know what you mean.
- But as far as sexual feelings go...

318
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:45,685
it started with
an obsessive relationship...

319
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:48,912
<i>with Miss July, 1978.
Do you know Playboy magazine?</i>

320
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:51,455
- I've heard of it.
- You know Crystal?

321
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:54,385
You don't know Crystal?
Well, I knew Crystal.

322
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:58,225
Is it my turn now?

323
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,124
Tell me something that
really pisses you off.

324
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:03,895
- Really drives you crazy.
- Pisses me off.

325
00:23:04,105 --> 00:23:06,870
- God, everything pisses me off.
- List a couple.

326
00:23:08,109 --> 00:23:11,443
Oh, I know. I hate being told
by strange men...

327
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:13,511
strange men in the street...

328
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:18,515
you know, to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life.

329
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:20,236
What else?

330
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:21,686
I hate...

331
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,381
I hate that 300 kilometers from here,
there's a war...

332
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:27,788
people are dying,
and nobody knows what to do.

333
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:30,293
Or they don't give a shit.
I don't know.

334
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:34,127
I hate that the media's
trying to control our minds.

335
00:23:34,336 --> 00:23:35,962
- The media?
- Yeah, the media.

336
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,696
It's very subtle, but it's
a new form of fascism, really.

337
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,760
I hate...

338
00:23:43,644 --> 00:23:47,171
I hate when I'm in a foreign country,
especially in America...

339
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,943
each time I wear black or lose my
temper or say anything about anything...

340
00:23:52,152 --> 00:23:55,418
they always go,
"Oh, it's so French. It's so cute."

341
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:58,989
I hate that.
I can't stand that. Really.

342
00:24:00,094 --> 00:24:01,244
Is that all?

343
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:03,885
Well, there's a lot of things, but...

344
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:06,566
- So it's my turn.
- Okay.

345
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:09,096
- You're gonna answer.
- Yes, I'll answer.

346
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:11,031
What's a problem for you?

347
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:13,070
You, probably.

348
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:14,489
What?

349
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:18,074
I had a thought the other day
that kind of...

350
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:20,075
qualifies as a problem.

351
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:21,404
What is it?

352
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:24,583
It was a thought I had
on the train, so...

353
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:26,445
Okay. All right.

354
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:28,517
Do you believe in reincarnation?

355
00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:30,745
Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.

356
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,188
A lot of people talk about past
lives and things like that, you know?

357
00:24:35,396 --> 00:24:38,853
And even if they don't believe in it
in some specific way...

358
00:24:39,065 --> 00:24:41,363
people have a notion
of an eternal soul.

359
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,465
- Yeah.
- Okay.

360
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:45,160
This is my thought:
50,000 years ago...

361
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,339
there's not even a million people.

362
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:51,373
Ten thousand years ago,
there's, like, two million people.

363
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:55,537
Now there's between five and six
billion people on the planet.

364
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:57,272
If we all have our own...

365
00:24:57,482 --> 00:24:59,382
individual, unique...

366
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:00,801
soul...

367
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:02,783
where did they all come from?

368
00:25:02,988 --> 00:25:06,583
Are modern souls only
a fraction of the original souls?

369
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:10,785
If they are, that represents
a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...

370
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:14,727
in the last 50,000 years, which is
a blip in the Earth's time.

371
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:18,198
So at best, we're these
tiny fractions...

372
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,867
of people walking...

373
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:24,406
Is that why we're so scattered?
Is that why we're so specialized?

374
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:26,167
Wait a minute, I'm not sure...

375
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:29,836
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's a totally scattered thought.

376
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:32,976
Which is kind of why it makes sense.

377
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:35,348
I agree with you.

378
00:25:36,587 --> 00:25:38,488
Let's get off this damn train.

379
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:15,886
This place is pretty neat.

380
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:17,082
Yeah.

381
00:26:17,295 --> 00:26:19,627
There's even a listening booth.

382
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:25,697
Have you heard of this singer?

383
00:26:27,505 --> 00:26:29,769
I think she's American.
A friend told me about her.

384
00:26:29,974 --> 00:26:33,306
Do you want to go see if that
listening booth still works?

385
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:34,705
Yeah, okay.

Quick. It's leaving.

400
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:51,502
Look, there's a rabbit.

401
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,330
Yeah.

402
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:55,738
Hey there, rabbit.

403
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:58,316
It's so cute.

404
00:29:00,923 --> 00:29:03,322
I visited this as a young teenager.

405
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:07,990
It left a bigger impression on me
at that time than the museums.

406
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:09,993
Yeah? It's tiny.

407
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:11,348
I know.

408
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:14,996
A little old man talked to us.
He was the groundskeeper.

409
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:18,036
He explained that most
of the people buried here...

410
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,764
had washed up on the bank
of the Danube.

411
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:23,742
How old are these?

412
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:28,011
Around the beginning of the century.
It's called No Name Cemetery...

413
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:30,809
because they often didn't know
who those people were.

414
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:33,110
Maybe a first name, that's all.

415
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:35,354
Why were all the bodies washing up?

416
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:39,491
I think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that.

417
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,992
But most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river.

418
00:29:44,998 --> 00:29:48,730
I always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world.

419
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:50,994
When I was a little girl,
I thought...

420
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:53,729
if none of your family or friends
knew you were dead...

421
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,908
then it's like
not really being dead.

422
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:59,010
People can invent the best
and the worst for you.

423
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:04,575
Here she is, I think.

424
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:08,217
Yeah, this is the one
I remember the most.

425
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:13,784
She was only 13 when she died.

426
00:30:14,193 --> 00:30:18,596
That meant something to me.
I was that age when I first saw this.

427
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:27,870
Now I'm 10 years older,
and she's still 13, I guess.

428
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:30,192
That's funny.

429
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:52,521
That's the Danube over there.

430
00:30:53,032 --> 00:30:54,693
That's a river, right?

431
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:56,085
Yeah.

432
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:05,467
This is...

433
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:07,108
gorgeous.

434
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:10,239
Yeah, this is beautiful.

435
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:17,716
I mean, we got...

436
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,613
We got a sunset here.

437
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:22,925
- Yeah.
- We got the Ferris wheel.

438
00:31:25,064 --> 00:31:26,826
It seems like...

439
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:29,122
this would be a...

440
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:32,285
What?

441
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:37,591
You know...

442
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:45,147
Are you trying to say
you want to kiss me?

443
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:55,439
But you know what?

444
00:32:55,652 --> 00:32:58,586
It doesn't matter what
generation you're born into.

445
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,051
Look at my parents.

446
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:04,455
They were angry, young May '68 people
revolting against everything.

447
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:08,426
The government, their conservative
Catholic backgrounds...

448
00:33:08,632 --> 00:33:12,123
Then I was born, and my father
became a successful architect.

449
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:15,360
We traveled around the world
while he built bridges...

450
00:33:15,571 --> 00:33:17,801
and, you know, towers and stuff.

451
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:20,872
I mean, I really can't
complain about anything.

452
00:33:21,078 --> 00:33:23,068
They love me more than anything...

453
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,442
and I've been raised with all
the freedom they fought for.

454
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,676
And yet, for me now,
it's another type of fight.

455
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:33,218
We have to deal with the same shit,
but we can't really know...

456
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:35,913
who or, you know, what the enemy is.

457
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,958
I don't know if
there really is an enemy.

458
00:33:39,161 --> 00:33:41,221
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

459
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:44,888
Rich kids' parents gave them too much.
Poor kids', not enough.

460
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,466
Too much attention,
not enough attention.

461
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,900
They either left or
taught them the wrong things.

462
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:54,907
My parents are just two people
who didn't like each other much...

463
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:56,976
who got married and had a kid.

464
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,511
And they tried their best
to be nice to me.

465
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,683
- Did your parents divorce?
- Yeah, finally.

466
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:06,115
They should have done it sooner.
They stuck together...

467
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:09,985
for the well-being of my sister
and I. Thank you very much.

468
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:13,727
I remember my mother told me
right in front of my father...

469
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:16,454
that he didn't really
want to have me.

470
00:34:16,664 --> 00:34:19,964
That he was pissed off when
he found out she was pregnant.

471
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:23,798
That I was a big mistake.
That really shaped the way I think.

472
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:28,271
I always saw the world as this place
where I really wasn't meant to be.

473
00:34:28,476 --> 00:34:29,466
That's so sad.

474
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:32,840
Well, I mean, I eventually
kind of took pride in it.

475
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:35,537
You know, like my life
was my own doing.

476
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,878
You know, like I was
crashing the big party.

477
00:34:39,087 --> 00:34:41,112
That's the way to see it.

478
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:44,688
My parents are still married
and I guess they're happy.

479
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,822
But I think it's healthy to rebel
against everything that came before.

480
00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:56,533
You know, I've been wondering lately...

481
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:00,741
do you know anyone
who's in a happy relationship?

482
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:05,402
Yeah, sure. You know,
I know happy couples.

483
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:08,239
But I think they lie to each other.

484
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,212
Yeah.

485
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:13,278
People can live their
whole life as a lie.

486
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:15,388
My grandmother was married...

487
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:18,683
and I thought she had an
uncomplicated love life.

488
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:22,919
But she just confessed to me
that she spent her whole life...

489
00:35:23,131 --> 00:35:26,190
dreaming about another man
she was in love with.

490
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,730
She just accepted her fate.
It's so sad.

491
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:33,068
In the same time, I love that
she had these emotions...

492
00:35:33,272 --> 00:35:35,605
and feelings I never
thought she had.

493
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,039
I guarantee you
it was better that way.

494
00:35:38,245 --> 00:35:41,612
If she'd known him, he'd have
disappointed her eventually.

495
00:35:41,814 --> 00:35:44,181
- How do you know?
- I know. I know.

496
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:46,943
People put romantic projections
on everything.

497
00:35:47,154 --> 00:35:49,850
It's not based in any kind of reality.

498
00:35:50,057 --> 00:35:53,753
Romantic projections?
Oh, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

499
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:57,259
"Oh, kiss me. The sunset.
Oh, it's so beautiful."

500
00:35:57,463 --> 00:36:00,956
Tell me about your grandmother.
What were you saying about her?

501
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,613
Check these guys out.

502
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:25,314
"Hans, I have a confession. I'm not
wearing underwear underneath this."

503
00:36:25,525 --> 00:36:28,186
"Oh, really? Does that frighten you?"

504
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,033
Can I tell you a secret?

505
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:37,551
Yeah.

506
00:36:37,637 --> 00:36:38,787
Come here.

507
00:36:39,105 --> 00:36:40,572
- What?
- Come here.

508
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:57,612
Look at this palm reader.
She's interesting looking.

509
00:36:57,822 --> 00:36:58,972
Yeah.

510
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:00,759
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

511
00:37:01,227 --> 00:37:03,718
- I made eye contact.
- She's not coming over here.

512
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:05,921
- Yes, she is.
- Oh, shit.

513
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,260
Oh, no.

514
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:12,526
- You want your palm read?
- No.

515
00:37:12,737 --> 00:37:14,899
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

516
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:16,596
- Okay.
- Hello.

517
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:18,506
Oh, here she is.

518
00:37:28,752 --> 00:37:30,687
I want your palm read.

519
00:37:33,224 --> 00:37:34,987
Yeah. How much is it?

520
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:36,916
For you, 50.

521
00:37:37,228 --> 00:37:38,378
Okay?

522
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:39,812
Okay.

523
00:37:46,237 --> 00:37:49,205
So you have been on a journey...

524
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:51,375
and you're a stranger
to this place.

525
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:54,044
You are...

526
00:37:54,245 --> 00:37:55,802
an adventurer.

527
00:37:56,247 --> 00:37:57,839
A seeker.

528
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:00,873
An adventurer in your mind.

529
00:38:05,823 --> 00:38:09,123
You are interested
in the power of the woman.

530
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:14,229
In the woman's deep strength
and creativity.

531
00:38:14,632 --> 00:38:16,963
You're becoming this woman.

532
00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:26,609
You need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life.

533
00:38:27,277 --> 00:38:30,678
Only if you find peace
within yourself...

534
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:34,909
will you find
true connection with others.

535
00:38:38,421 --> 00:38:39,888
That is a stranger to you?

536
00:38:40,723 --> 00:38:42,055
I guess so.

537
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:50,492
You will be all right.
He's learning.

538
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:52,449
Okay.

539
00:38:52,902 --> 00:38:54,052
Money.

540
00:39:01,644 --> 00:39:03,578
You're both stars.

541
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,339
Don't forget.

542
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:08,875
When the stars exploded
billions of years ago...

543
00:39:09,085 --> 00:39:11,884
they formed everything
that is this world.

544
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:14,954
Everything we know is stardust.

545
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:19,094
So don't forget, you are stardust.

546
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:25,560
That's very nice and all.

547
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:28,100
I mean, that we're all stardust...

548
00:39:28,303 --> 00:39:30,738
and you're becoming this great woman.

549
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,831
But I hope you don't take that
any more seriously...

550
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:36,169
than some horoscope
in a newspaper.

551
00:39:36,379 --> 00:39:40,645
What? She knew I was on vacation
and that we didn't know each other...

552
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:43,750
and that I was going
to become this great woman.

553
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:46,318
But what was that
"I am learning" bullshit?

554
00:39:46,521 --> 00:39:48,854
That's way condescending, you know?

555
00:39:49,057 --> 00:39:51,116
I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

556
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,660
I mean, if opportunists like that
ever had to tell the real truth...

557
00:39:55,864 --> 00:39:57,922
it would put them
out of business.

558
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:02,729
Just once, I'd love to see some
little old lady save up all her money...

559
00:40:02,938 --> 00:40:07,602
to go to the fortuneteller. She'd
get there and the woman would say...

560
00:40:09,643 --> 00:40:12,738
"Tomorrow and all
your remaining days...

561
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:14,973
will be exactly like today...

562
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:17,708
a tedious collection of hours.

563
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:21,150
And you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts...

564
00:40:21,356 --> 00:40:23,755
and no new travels.

565
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:26,860
And when you die,
you'll be completely forgotten.

566
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:29,295
Fifty schillings, please."

567
00:40:29,498 --> 00:40:31,227
That I'd like to see.

568
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:33,732
It's so funny how...

569
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:37,461
she almost didn't notice you.
It's weird. I wonder why.

570
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:41,835
She was really wise and intense.
I really loved what she said.

571
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:45,877
You pay your money to hear what
makes you feel good about yourself.

572
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,572
Maybe there's a seedy section of Vienna.
We can buy a hit of crack.

573
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:51,307
Would you like that?

574
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,644
You're so...

575
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,948
Stardust. Stardust.

576
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,162
There's an exhibition.

577
00:41:09,904 --> 00:41:13,236
I guess we'll miss it.
It doesn't start until next week.

578
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:15,641
Yeah, I think so.

579
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:20,677
I actually saw this one in a museum.

580
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:23,916
I stared and stared at it.

581
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:26,416
Must have been 45 minutes.

582
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:28,338
I love it.

583
00:41:29,122 --> 00:41:31,557
<i>La voie ferrée.</i>
It's great.

584
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:36,921
I love the way the people are
dissolving into the background.

585
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:39,481
Look at this.

586
00:41:41,035 --> 00:41:42,524
It's like the environments...

587
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:45,131
are stronger than the people.

588
00:41:46,806 --> 00:41:49,740
His human figures are
always so transitory.

589
00:41:49,944 --> 00:41:52,002
It's funny. Transitory?

590
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:53,979
Transitory.

591
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,057
- You think this is open?
- I don't know. Let's try it.

592
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,225
I was in an old church like this...

593
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,558
with my grandmother
a few days ago in Budapest.

594
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,501
Even though I reject
most of the religious thing...

595
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:56,797
I can't help but feeling for
those people that come here...

596
00:42:57,009 --> 00:43:00,273
lost or in pain, guilt...

597
00:43:01,014 --> 00:43:03,344
looking for some kind of answers.

598
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,513
It fascinates me how a single place
can join pain and happiness...

599
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,052
of so many generations.

600
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:13,749
You're close with your grandmother?

601
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:16,677
Yeah.

602
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:22,694
I think it's because I always
have this strange feeling...

603
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:26,893
that I'm this very old woman
laying down, about to die.

604
00:43:28,507 --> 00:43:30,701
You know, that my life is just...

605
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,737
her memories or something.

606
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:38,109
That's so wild.

607
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:43,746
I always think that I'm still
this 13-year-old boy...

608
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:47,047
who doesn't really know how
to be an adult, pretending to...

609
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:51,751
live my life, taking notes for when
I'll really have to do it.

610
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,030
Like I'm in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play.

611
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,958
That's funny.

612
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,068
Then up there in the Ferris wheel,
it was like...

613
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:06,334
this very old woman
kissing this very young boy. Right?

614
00:44:11,147 --> 00:44:15,209
Do you know anything about
the Quakers, the Quaker religion?

615
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,803
No, not much.

616
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,248
Well, I went to
this Quaker wedding once...

617
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,322
and it was fantastic.

618
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,820
What they do is...

619
00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:28,293
the couple comes in and they kneel
in front of the whole congregation...

620
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:30,022
and they stare at each other.

621
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:35,160
Nobody says a word unless they feel
that God moves them to speak...

622
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,033
or say something.

623
00:44:37,974 --> 00:44:40,636
And then, after an hour or so of just...

624
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,943
staring at each other...

625
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:45,779
they're married.

626
00:44:47,716 --> 00:44:49,776
That's beautiful. I like that.

627
00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:08,059
This is a horrible story.

628
00:45:09,138 --> 00:45:10,288
What?

629
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:13,072
It's not the appropriate place
to tell it.

630
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:16,210
Well, I was driving around
with this buddy of mine.

631
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,313
He's a big atheist, you know.

632
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:21,381
And he came to a stop
next to this homeless guy.

633
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,881
My buddy takes out a $ 100 bill...

634
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:25,484
and leans out the window...

635
00:45:25,688 --> 00:45:28,951
and he says,
"Do you believe in God?"

636
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:33,524
And the guy looks at my friend,
he looks at the money.

637
00:45:33,796 --> 00:45:35,697
He says...

638
00:45:36,065 --> 00:45:37,725
"Yes, I do."

639
00:45:37,932 --> 00:45:39,867
My friend says, "Wrong answer."

640
00:45:40,068 --> 00:45:41,558
We drove away.

641
00:45:42,404 --> 00:45:43,894
That's mean.

642
00:45:55,184 --> 00:45:59,017
Would you be in Paris by now
if you hadn't gotten off the train?

643
00:45:59,487 --> 00:46:01,148
No, not yet.

644
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,518
What would you be doing?

645
00:46:03,724 --> 00:46:06,387
I'd probably be hanging around
the airport...

646
00:46:06,595 --> 00:46:09,961
crying in my coffee
because you didn't come with me.

647
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:17,835
I'd probably gotten off the train
in Salzburg with someone else.

648
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:20,008
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

649
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,109
So I'm just a dumb American...

650
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:26,440
momentarily decorating
your blank canvas, huh?

651
00:46:26,681 --> 00:46:29,809
- I'm having a great time.
- Really?

652
00:46:30,017 --> 00:46:31,245
Me too.

653
00:46:33,054 --> 00:46:35,023
I'm glad, because
no one knows I'm here.

654
00:46:35,223 --> 00:46:37,214
I don't know anyone
that would tell me...

655
00:46:37,425 --> 00:46:39,518
all those bad things you've done.

656
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:42,059
- I'll tell you some.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

657
00:46:43,064 --> 00:46:47,058
You hear so much shit about people.
I always feel like...

658
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:49,668
the general of an army
when I start dating.

659
00:46:49,871 --> 00:46:51,963
Plotting my strategy
and maneuverings...

660
00:46:52,173 --> 00:46:55,701
knowing his weak points,
what would hurt him, seduce him.

661
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,442
It's horrible.

662
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:03,511
If we were always around each other...

663
00:47:03,718 --> 00:47:07,518
what would be the first thing
about me that would drive you mad?

664
00:47:08,255 --> 00:47:11,223
No. I'm not going to
answer this question.

665
00:47:11,425 --> 00:47:14,518
I dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that.

666
00:47:14,728 --> 00:47:16,321
"What about me bugs you?"

667
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:20,227
Finally I said, "I don't think
you handle criticism too well."

668
00:47:20,434 --> 00:47:23,527
She flew into a rage and
broke up with me. That's true.

669
00:47:23,737 --> 00:47:25,864
All she wanted was
to have an excuse...

670
00:47:26,073 --> 00:47:28,768
to tell me what she thought
was wrong with me.

671
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:30,203
Is that what you want?

672
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,139
Something about me bugs you?

673
00:47:32,647 --> 00:47:35,547
- What is it about me bugs you?
- Nothing at all.

674
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:38,217
If it had to be something,
what would it be?

675
00:47:38,585 --> 00:47:42,077
If it had to be something,
if I had to think about it...

676
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:45,884
I kind of didn't really like this
reaction at the palm reader.

677
00:47:46,092 --> 00:47:48,457
You were like this rooster prick.

678
00:47:48,661 --> 00:47:50,526
What the hell
is a rooster prick?

679
00:47:50,731 --> 00:47:52,220
You were like a boy whining...

680
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:55,093
because all the attention
wasn't focused on him.

681
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:58,396
All right, listen.
This woman robs you blind, okay?

682
00:47:58,604 --> 00:48:00,937
You were like a boy
walking by an ice-cream store...

683
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,904
crying because his mom
won't buy him a milk shake.

684
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:07,169
I don't care what this charlatan
has to say about...

685
00:48:09,382 --> 00:48:10,532
What?

686
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,853
I understand a little,
but he doesn't at all.

687
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:21,415
May I ask you a question?

688
00:48:23,763 --> 00:48:26,663
So I would like to
make a deal with you.

689
00:48:28,566 --> 00:48:32,765
I mean, instead of just asking you
for money, I will ask you for a word.

690
00:48:33,272 --> 00:48:37,572
You give me a word, I take the word,
and then I will write a poem...

691
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,277
with the word inside.

692
00:48:40,512 --> 00:48:42,980
And if you like it,
if you like my poem...

693
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:45,942
if it adds something to
your life in any way...

694
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:48,778
then you can pay me
whatever you feel like.

695
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:51,445
I'll write in English, of course.

696
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,385
- Okay.
- All right. Great.

697
00:48:56,961 --> 00:48:58,111
So?

698
00:49:00,198 --> 00:49:01,461
Pick a word.

699
00:49:03,334 --> 00:49:04,484
A word.

700
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:08,234
- Milk shake.
- Milk shake? Oh, good.

701
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,340
I was gonna say "rooster prick."
But great. Milk shake.

702
00:49:11,543 --> 00:49:12,975
"Milk shake"?

703
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:15,308
Okay, milk shake.

704
00:49:15,979 --> 00:49:17,972
- All right, so...
- Good.

705
00:49:29,027 --> 00:49:33,259
I gotta say, I like this
Viennese variation of bum.

706
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:36,557
I like what he said about
adding something to your life.

707
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:40,568
So, were we having
our first fight back there?

708
00:49:42,006 --> 00:49:44,099
I think so. I think we were.

709
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:47,903
Even if we were, why does everyone
think conflict is so bad?

710
00:49:48,112 --> 00:49:50,945
There's a lot of good things
coming out of conflict.

711
00:49:51,148 --> 00:49:52,877
Yeah, I guess so.

712
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:56,515
I always think if I could
just accept the fact...

713
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,656
that my life was supposed to be
difficult, that's what's expected...

714
00:50:00,858 --> 00:50:02,689
then I might not get so pissed off.

715
00:50:02,893 --> 00:50:05,692
And I'd just be glad
when something nice happens.

716
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:07,396
That's why I'm still in school.

717
00:50:07,597 --> 00:50:10,088
It's easier to have
something to fight against.

718
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,031
Well, we've all had such
competitiveness ingrained in us.

719
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:17,599
You know, I can be doing
the most nothing thing.

720
00:50:17,808 --> 00:50:20,140
Throwing some darts
or shooting some pool.

721
00:50:20,343 --> 00:50:23,176
Then all of a sudden,
I feel it come over me.

722
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:25,609
I have got to win.

723
00:50:25,816 --> 00:50:29,275
Is that why you tried to get me
off the train? Competitiveness?

724
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,817
What do you mean?

725
00:50:32,723 --> 00:50:33,917
I got a poem.

726
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:35,848
Oh, all right.

727
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,222
Will you read it to us?

728
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:44,265
Sure. Okay.

729
00:50:48,304 --> 00:50:50,238
"Daydream delusion

730
00:50:50,706 --> 00:50:52,674
"Limousine eyelash

00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:55,907

"Drop a tear in my wine glass

00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:03,544
"See what you mean to me

00:51:03,886 --> 00:51:06,752
"Sweetcakes and milk shakes

00:51:07,056 --> 00:51:09,218
"I am a delusion angel

00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:11,952
"I'm a fantasy parade

00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:16,396
"I want you to know what I think
Don't want you to guess anymore

00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:18,999

00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,268

"Don't you know me?

00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,883
"Don't you know me by now?"

748
00:51:41,122 --> 00:51:42,316
Great.

749
00:51:42,991 --> 00:51:45,221
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

750
00:51:48,831 --> 00:51:50,058
Here you go.

751
00:51:51,867 --> 00:51:53,562
- Thanks.
- All right.

752
00:51:53,768 --> 00:51:55,963
- Here. Thank you.
- Thank you.

753
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:57,322
Good luck.

754
00:52:13,355 --> 00:52:15,049
It was wonderful, no?

755
00:52:19,727 --> 00:52:22,389
- What?
- He probably didn't just write that.

756
00:52:22,596 --> 00:52:25,259
He wrote it, but he
probably plugs that word in.

757
00:52:25,466 --> 00:52:27,729
You know, whatever, "milk shake."

758
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,528
What do you mean?

759
00:52:29,736 --> 00:52:31,932
Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

760
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,205
You know what drives me crazy?
People talking about...

761
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:45,112
how great technology is,
how it saves all this time.

762
00:52:45,319 --> 00:52:48,312
But what good is saved time
if nobody uses it?

763
00:52:48,522 --> 00:52:50,854
If it just turns into more busy work.

764
00:52:51,058 --> 00:52:55,496
I never hear anybody say, "With the time
I've saved using my word processor...

765
00:52:55,696 --> 00:52:58,597
I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery
and hang out."

766
00:52:58,966 --> 00:53:01,957
- You don't hear that.
- Time is so abstract anyway.

767
00:53:02,202 --> 00:53:04,796
- Are you looking at this girl?
- What?

768
00:53:05,004 --> 00:53:06,370
Nothing.

769
00:53:07,007 --> 00:53:08,440
You wanna go in here?

770
00:53:08,642 --> 00:53:12,100
- You wanna go in here?
- Yeah. It's a club, no?

771
00:53:14,213 --> 00:53:15,203
Wanna go?

772
00:53:15,415 --> 00:53:16,565
Hello.

773
00:53:18,384 --> 00:53:20,215
Fifty schillings.

774
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,320
- Each.
- I got 100. Here, I got it.

775
00:53:24,157 --> 00:53:26,318
I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.

776
00:54:14,307 --> 00:54:16,536
- You gonna buy me a beer?
- Yeah.

777
00:54:20,445 --> 00:54:23,142
You think Old Milwaukee
is expensive here?

778
00:54:51,043 --> 00:54:54,842
We haven't talked about this yet,
but are you dating anyone?

779
00:54:55,046 --> 00:54:59,414
You got a boyfriend waiting on you
back in Paris or anything like that?

780
00:54:59,617 --> 00:55:02,414
- No, not right now.
- But you did.

781
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:05,516
We broke up six months ago.

782
00:55:05,724 --> 00:55:08,215
Six months ago? Oh, I'm sorry.

783
00:55:08,426 --> 00:55:11,155
I mean, I'm not that sorry.
Tell me about it.

784
00:55:11,362 --> 00:55:15,129
No way. I can't.
It's really, really boring.

785
00:55:15,332 --> 00:55:17,301
Come on. Tell me about it.

786
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,333
I was really disappointed.

787
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:24,565
I thought this one would last
for a while. He was...

788
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:28,844
very stupid, ugly,
bad in bed, alcoholic...

789
00:55:29,748 --> 00:55:32,341
- You know.
- A real prize winner.

790
00:55:33,484 --> 00:55:35,385
I was kind of giving him a favor.

791
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:38,350
But he left me,
saying I loved him too much.

792
00:55:38,555 --> 00:55:43,288
I was blocking his artistic expression
or some shit like that.

793
00:55:44,028 --> 00:55:46,622
But anyway, I was traumatized
and became...

794
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:49,461
And became totally obsessed with him.

795
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:53,094
So I went to a shrink, and it came up
that I had written...

796
00:55:53,303 --> 00:55:57,763
this stupid story about this
woman trying to kill her boyfriend...

797
00:55:58,808 --> 00:56:00,105
and how she'd do it.

798
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:03,643
It's all the details
of how to do it and not get caught...

799
00:56:03,847 --> 00:56:05,838
She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

800
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:12,082
Yeah, she was. It's nothing I would do,
but it was just some writing.

801
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:13,551
No, I understand.

802
00:56:13,757 --> 00:56:16,590
This stupid shrink believed
everything I told her.

803
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:20,490
It was my first time seeing her.
She said she had to call the police.

804
00:56:20,696 --> 00:56:22,597
She had to call the police?

805
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,098
She was totally convinced
I was really gonna do it.

806
00:56:27,303 --> 00:56:30,239
Even though I had explained
it was just some writing.

807
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,375
She said, looking into my eyes,
"The way you said it...

808
00:56:33,576 --> 00:56:35,442
I know you are going to do it."

809
00:56:35,645 --> 00:56:38,205
She was totally out of her mind.

810
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:41,575
It was my first and last session.

811
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:43,547
So what happened then?

812
00:56:45,456 --> 00:56:47,514
I totally got over him.

813
00:56:47,957 --> 00:56:49,288
But now, I'm obsessed...

814
00:56:49,491 --> 00:56:53,986
that he's gonna die from
an accident or 1000 kilometers away.

815
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:56,525
And I'm gonna be the one accused.

816
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:01,765
Why is it you become obsessed
with people you don't...

817
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,699
really like that much?

818
00:57:03,906 --> 00:57:05,271
I don't know.

819
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:08,859
So how about you?

820
00:57:10,646 --> 00:57:12,876
- What?
- Are you with anyone?

821
00:57:14,783 --> 00:57:18,549
It's funny how we managed to avoid
this subject for so long.

822
00:57:18,753 --> 00:57:20,516
But now you have to tell me.

823
00:57:20,722 --> 00:57:22,917
Well, I kind of see love...

824
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:27,357
as this escape for two people
who don't know how to be alone.

825
00:57:29,164 --> 00:57:31,632
It's funny.
People always talk about how...

826
00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:34,631
love is this totally unselfish,
giving thing.

827
00:57:34,837 --> 00:57:38,101
But if you think about it,
there's nothing more selfish.

828
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,201
I know.

829
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:42,976
So who just broke up with you?

830
00:57:44,912 --> 00:57:46,074
What?

831
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,681
You sound like you just were hurt.

832
00:57:50,886 --> 00:57:52,182
Do I?

833
00:57:52,454 --> 00:57:53,716
All right.

834
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,323
Big confession.

835
00:57:57,058 --> 00:57:59,652
I should've told you this
earlier or something.

836
00:58:00,662 --> 00:58:03,129
I didn't come to Europe just to...

837
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:06,528
hang out and read Hemingway in Paris
and shit like that.

838
00:58:07,268 --> 00:58:10,568
I saved up my money all spring to
fly to Madrid...

839
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:13,331
and spend the summer
with my girlfriend...

840
00:58:13,542 --> 00:58:15,271
- Your girlfriend?
- My ex-girlfriend...

841
00:58:15,476 --> 00:58:18,809
who has been on this art history
program for the last year.

842
00:58:19,013 --> 00:58:22,414
Anyway, I got here.
We were reunited at long last...

843
00:58:22,617 --> 00:58:26,746
and we went out to dinner our
first night with six of her friends.

844
00:58:26,953 --> 00:58:29,582
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo...

845
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:31,951
Maria, Suzy from home.

846
00:58:32,158 --> 00:58:35,525
She managed to avoid being alone
with me for the first few days...

847
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:40,358
and I stuck around just to let it
sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

848
00:58:42,136 --> 00:58:45,901
So I bought the cheapest flight out,
this one leaving out of Vienna.

849
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:49,598
It didn't leave for a couple weeks,
so I bought this Eurail pass.

850
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:54,407
You know what's the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you?

851
00:58:56,316 --> 00:58:59,115
It's when you remember
how little you thought about...

852
00:58:59,319 --> 00:59:02,050
the people you broke up with,
and you realize...

853
00:59:02,255 --> 00:59:05,885
that that is how little
they're thinking about you.

854
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:08,391
You'd like to think
you're both in pain...

855
00:59:08,596 --> 00:59:11,587
but really, they're just,
"Hey, I'm glad you're gone."

856
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,232
Believe me, I know.

857
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,458
You should look at bright colors.

858
00:59:18,171 --> 00:59:20,037
That's what the shrink told me.

859
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,834
I was paying her 900 francs an hour...

860
00:59:23,043 --> 00:59:25,341
to hear that I
was a homicidal maniac...

861
00:59:25,545 --> 00:59:29,607
but I could shift my obsession if I
would concentrate on bright colors.

862
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,078
Did it work?

863
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:36,679
- Didn't help your pinball.
- Well, no.

864
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:41,090
Yeah, well, you know,
I haven't killed anyone lately.

865
00:59:41,293 --> 00:59:42,625
Not lately?

866
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:44,828
That's good.
You're cured then.

867
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:54,502
There's breeds of monkeys,
and all they do is have sex...

868
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,274
all the time.

869
00:59:56,475 --> 00:59:58,705
And they turn out to be
the least violent...

870
00:59:58,911 --> 01:00:01,879
the most peaceful, the most happy.

871
01:00:02,081 --> 01:00:04,571
So maybe fooling around's
not so bad.

872
01:00:04,783 --> 01:00:07,912
- Are you talking about monkeys?
- Yes, I am.

873
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,485
- I thought so.
- Why?

874
01:00:09,688 --> 01:00:13,386
I never heard this one.
But it reminds me of this perfect...

875
01:00:13,592 --> 01:00:16,027
male argument to justify them
fooling around.

876
01:00:16,228 --> 01:00:19,664
Women monkeys are fooling around too.
Everybody's fooling around.

877
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,061
That's cute. I have this awful,
paranoid thought...

878
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:28,467
that feminism was mostly invented
by men so they could...

879
01:00:28,674 --> 01:00:29,971
fool around more.

880
01:00:30,175 --> 01:00:33,337
"Woman, free your mind,
free your body. Sleep with me.

881
01:00:33,544 --> 01:00:38,072
We're all happy and free, as long as
I can fuck as much as I can."

882
01:00:38,884 --> 01:00:39,815
All right.

883
01:00:40,018 --> 01:00:43,317
But maybe there's some
biological things at work here.

884
01:00:43,522 --> 01:00:45,046
If you had an island...

885
01:00:45,257 --> 01:00:49,887
and there were 99 women
on the island and only one man...

886
01:00:50,094 --> 01:00:52,893
in a year, you'd have
the possibility of 99 babies.

887
01:00:53,097 --> 01:00:56,396
But if you have an island
with 99 men and only one woman...

888
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:01,264
in a year, you have the possibility
of only one baby. So...

889
01:01:01,572 --> 01:01:02,539
You know what?

890
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:06,904
On this island, I think there
will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

891
01:01:07,111 --> 01:01:11,013
They would've killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman.

892
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:15,447
And on the other island,
there would be 99 women, 99 babies...

893
01:01:15,653 --> 01:01:17,314
and no more man.

894
01:01:17,522 --> 01:01:20,082
Because they would've all
eaten him alive.

895
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:21,691
Oh, yeah?

896
01:01:21,892 --> 01:01:23,621
There's something to that.

897
01:01:23,828 --> 01:01:27,992
On some level, women don't mind
the idea of destroying a man.

898
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:32,067
I was walking down the street
with my ex-girlfriend...

899
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:36,763
and we'd just walked by these four
thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

900
01:01:36,974 --> 01:01:40,137
And one of them says,
"Hey, baby. Nice ass!"

901
01:01:40,345 --> 01:01:44,007
So I'm like, "No big deal.
I won't get uptight about this."

902
01:01:44,215 --> 01:01:45,773
Plus, there were four of them.

903
01:01:45,983 --> 01:01:48,952
Exactly. But she says,
"Fuck you, dickheads!"

904
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:52,350
And I'm like, "Okay.
Wait a minute, here."

905
01:01:52,556 --> 01:01:55,116
They're not gonna come over
and kick her ass.

906
01:01:55,326 --> 01:01:58,260
So who just got pushed
to the frontline on that one?

907
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:01,430
Women say they hate it
if you're all protective.

908
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:06,000
But if it suits them, then
they'll tell you you're being unmanly.

909
01:02:06,202 --> 01:02:10,332
You know what? I don't think
woman really wants to destroy man.

910
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:13,607
Even if they want to,
they don't succeed.

911
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:16,005
I'm sure even men are
destroying women...

912
01:02:16,212 --> 01:02:19,272
or are capable of destroying women
much more than women...

913
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:21,780
Anyway, it's depressing.
You know what?

914
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:24,579
- You wanna stop talking about this?
- I hate it.

915
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:26,347
Men, women, it's...

916
01:02:26,555 --> 01:02:29,046
There's no end to it.

917
01:02:29,592 --> 01:02:31,081
It's like a skipping record.

918
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:34,491
Every couple's been having
this conversation forever.

919
01:02:34,697 --> 01:02:36,790
And nobody came up with anything.

920
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:55,884
I saw a documentary on that.
It's a birth dance.

921
01:02:56,084 --> 01:02:57,551
A birth dance?

922
01:03:26,014 --> 01:03:27,675
Should I give her some money?

923
01:03:28,283 --> 01:03:31,184
Everything that's interesting
costs a little money.

924
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:34,712
So a birth dance, huh?

925
01:03:34,923 --> 01:03:37,653
Looked a little bit
like a mating dance to me.

926
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:40,658
No, but really.
Women used it when giving birth.

927
01:03:40,862 --> 01:03:43,263
In part of the world,
they still do it.

928
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,967
The woman in labor enters a tent...

929
01:03:47,168 --> 01:03:49,761
and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance.

930
01:03:49,971 --> 01:03:52,269
They encourage her
to dance with them...

931
01:03:52,474 --> 01:03:54,772
so as to make
the birth less painful.

932
01:03:54,976 --> 01:03:58,412
And when the baby is born,
they all dance in celebration.

933
01:03:59,547 --> 01:04:01,811
I don't think my mom
would've gone for that.

934
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:06,548
I like the idea of dancing as something
everybody participates in.

935
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:09,883
I know. I heard about this old guy...

936
01:04:10,091 --> 01:04:12,217
who was watching
some young people dance.

937
01:04:12,426 --> 01:04:13,824
He said, "How beautiful.

938
01:04:14,027 --> 01:04:16,963
They're shaking off their genitals
to become angels."

939
01:04:17,164 --> 01:04:18,062
I like that.

940
01:04:18,266 --> 01:04:19,459
One question, though.

941
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:23,329
When the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff...

942
01:04:23,538 --> 01:04:24,688
where are the men?

943
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:29,138
Are we out food gathering? Are we not
invited? You all don't need us?

944
01:04:29,342 --> 01:04:31,641
Men are lucky we don't
bite off their heads after mating.

945
01:04:31,846 --> 01:04:34,815
Certain insects do that,
like spiders and stuff?

946
01:04:35,015 --> 01:04:37,415
We let you live.
What are you complaining about?

947
01:04:37,618 --> 01:04:41,246
See, you're officially kidding.
But there's something to that.

948
01:04:41,454 --> 01:04:43,581
You keep bringing stuff like that up.

949
01:04:44,224 --> 01:04:47,626
No, no. Wait a minute.
Talking seriously here.

950
01:04:47,827 --> 01:04:50,729
I mean, I always feel
this pressure of being...

951
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:53,559
a strong and independent
icon of womanhood...

952
01:04:53,767 --> 01:04:55,792
and not making it look like...

953
01:04:56,002 --> 01:04:59,095
my whole life is revolving
around some guy.

954
01:05:00,673 --> 01:05:02,005
But loving someone...

955
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:05,644
and being loved
means so much to me.

956
01:05:06,313 --> 01:05:08,645
I always make fun of it and stuff...

957
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:11,674
but isn't everything
we do in life...

958
01:05:11,884 --> 01:05:14,752
a way to be loved a little more?

959
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:20,422
I don't know.

960
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,794
Sometimes I dream...

961
01:05:22,996 --> 01:05:26,022
about being a good father
and a good husband.

962
01:05:26,232 --> 01:05:28,699
And sometimes it feels really close.

963
01:05:29,368 --> 01:05:31,268
But then other times...

964
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:34,363
it seems silly...

965
01:05:34,574 --> 01:05:36,040
like it would...

966
01:05:36,408 --> 01:05:38,205
ruin my whole life.

967
01:05:38,878 --> 01:05:42,040
And it's not just
a fear of commitment...

968
01:05:42,248 --> 01:05:45,375
or that I'm incapable
of caring or loving because...

969
01:05:45,585 --> 01:05:46,812
I can.

970
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,849
It's just that, if I'm
totally honest with myself...

971
01:05:52,124 --> 01:05:53,786
I think I'd rather die knowing...

972
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:56,518
that I was
really good at something.

973
01:05:56,729 --> 01:05:59,561
That I had excelled
in some way...

974
01:05:59,798 --> 01:06:01,699
than that I'd just been in...

975
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,198
a nice, caring relationship.

976
01:06:11,409 --> 01:06:14,811
I had worked for this older man,
and once he told me...

977
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:18,677
that he had spent all of his life
thinking about his career.

978
01:06:18,885 --> 01:06:21,182
He was 52,
and it suddenly struck him...

979
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:25,050
that he had never really
given anything of himself.

980
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,825
His life was for no one and nothing.

981
01:06:29,128 --> 01:06:31,459
He was almost crying saying that.

982
01:06:34,465 --> 01:06:36,934
I believe if there's
any kind of God...

983
01:06:37,135 --> 01:06:39,126
it wouldn't be in any of us...

984
01:06:39,437 --> 01:06:41,337
not you or me...

985
01:06:42,107 --> 01:06:45,234
but just this little space
in between.

986
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:50,272
If there's any kind of magic
in this world...

987
01:06:50,481 --> 01:06:54,884
it must be in the attempt of
understanding someone sharing something.

988
01:06:57,155 --> 01:07:00,454
I know, it's almost
impossible to succeed...

989
01:07:01,292 --> 01:07:03,021
but who cares really?

990
01:07:04,128 --> 01:07:06,562
The answer must be in the attempt.

991
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:18,797
I think this is a civilization in
decline. Look at the service.

992
01:08:19,002 --> 01:08:22,437
Where is the waitress?
In New York, she'd be out of a job.

993
01:08:31,547 --> 01:08:33,708
I'm gonna call my friend in Paris...

994
01:08:33,883 --> 01:08:37,011
who I'm supposed to have
lunch with in eight hours.

995
01:08:45,227 --> 01:08:46,455
Pick up.

996
01:08:46,663 --> 01:08:48,596
- Pick up the phone.
- All right.

997
01:09:01,644 --> 01:09:05,546
I've been working on my English.
You wanna talk in English, for laughs?

998
01:09:05,981 --> 01:09:08,380
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

999
01:09:10,118 --> 01:09:13,610
I don't think I'll be able to
make it for lunch today.

1000
01:09:15,256 --> 01:09:19,022
I met a guy on the train,
and I got off with him in Vienna.

1001
01:09:19,261 --> 01:09:21,251
Are you crazy?

1002
01:09:22,297 --> 01:09:23,696
Probably.

1003
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:27,191
- He's Austrian? He's from there?
- No, No.

1004
01:09:27,402 --> 01:09:31,099
He's passing through. He's American.
He's going back home tomorrow.

1005
01:09:31,306 --> 01:09:32,671
Why'd you get off?

1006
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:36,309
Well, he convinced me.

1007
01:09:37,245 --> 01:09:41,011
I mean, actually, I was ready to
get off the train with him...

1008
01:09:41,216 --> 01:09:43,184
after talking to him a short while.

1009
01:09:43,384 --> 01:09:45,409
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

1010
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:49,254
In the lounge car,
he began to talk about...

1011
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:52,550
him as a boy seeing
his great-grandmother's ghost.

1012
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:56,158
I think that's when I fell for him.

1013
01:09:57,265 --> 01:10:01,100
Just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams.

1014
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,196
He trapped me.

1015
01:10:07,408 --> 01:10:09,102
And he's so cute.

1016
01:10:09,309 --> 01:10:11,470
He has beautiful blue eyes...

1017
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,669
nice pink lips...

1018
01:10:14,514 --> 01:10:16,106
greasy hair.

1019
01:10:16,817 --> 01:10:18,408
I love it.

1020
01:10:18,785 --> 01:10:21,618
He's kind of tall,
and he's a little clumsy.

1021
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,724
I like to feel his eyes on me
when I look away.

1022
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:33,524
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.
It's so cute.

1023
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:37,294
- What?
- Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable.

1024
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:41,331
As the night went on,
I began to like him more and more.

1025
01:10:43,176 --> 01:10:44,803
I'm afraid he's scared of me.

1026
01:10:45,011 --> 01:10:48,970
I told him the story about
the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend.

1027
01:10:49,482 --> 01:10:50,950
He must be scared to death.

1028
01:10:51,151 --> 01:10:54,416
He must be thinking I'm
this manipulative, mean woman.

1029
01:10:56,689 --> 01:10:59,181
I just hope he doesn't feel
that way about me.

1030
01:10:59,392 --> 01:11:02,362
Because, you know me,
I'm the most harmless person.

1031
01:11:03,864 --> 01:11:06,764
The only person I could
really hurt is myself.

1032
01:11:07,668 --> 01:11:09,567
I don't think he's scared of you.

1033
01:11:09,769 --> 01:11:11,601
I think he's crazy about you.

1034
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:14,331
- Really?
- I've known you a long time.

1035
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:17,009
I got a good feeling.
You gonna see him again?

1036
01:11:19,779 --> 01:11:22,213
We haven't talked about that yet.

1037
01:11:26,886 --> 01:11:29,583
Okay, it's your turn.
You call your friend.

1038
01:11:29,789 --> 01:11:31,689
All right, all right.

1039
01:11:35,093 --> 01:11:37,619
I usually get this guy's
answering machine.

1040
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:41,960
Hi, dude. What's up?

1041
01:11:43,902 --> 01:11:46,735
Hey, Frank. How you been?
I'm glad you're home.

1042
01:11:46,939 --> 01:11:48,371
Cool. Yeah.

1043
01:11:48,574 --> 01:11:50,131
So how was Madrid?

1044
01:11:50,809 --> 01:11:52,902
Madrid sucked.

1045
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:56,241
Lisa and I had our
long overdue meltdown.

1046
01:11:56,781 --> 01:11:58,682
Too bad. I told you, no?

1047
01:11:58,884 --> 01:12:02,046
Yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing
just never works.

1048
01:12:02,254 --> 01:12:04,278
I was only in Madrid
for a couple days.

1049
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:07,151
I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna.

1050
01:12:09,161 --> 01:12:12,391
You know, it really wasn't
that much cheaper. I just...

1051
01:12:12,598 --> 01:12:16,829
I couldn't go home right away.
I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

1052
01:12:17,034 --> 01:12:19,800
I just wanted to be a ghost,
completely anonymous.

1053
01:12:21,473 --> 01:12:22,804
So are you okay now?

1054
01:12:23,008 --> 01:12:26,034
Yeah. I'm great. I'm great.
That's the thing.

1055
01:12:26,644 --> 01:12:27,794
I'm rapturous.

1056
01:12:28,312 --> 01:12:29,803
And I'll tell you why.

1057
01:12:30,015 --> 01:12:32,916
I met somebody
on my last night in Europe.

1058
01:12:33,118 --> 01:12:35,815
- That's incredible.
- I know, I know.

1059
01:12:36,021 --> 01:12:39,387
You know how they say we're all
each other's demons and angels?

1060
01:12:40,424 --> 01:12:43,791
Well, she was literally
a Botticelli angel...

1061
01:12:44,595 --> 01:12:46,621
telling me everything
would be okay.

1062
01:12:49,634 --> 01:12:50,794
How did you meet?

1063
01:12:52,403 --> 01:12:53,871
On the train.

1064
01:12:54,339 --> 01:12:57,501
She was sitting next to
a weird couple that was fighting...

1065
01:12:57,708 --> 01:13:00,871
so she moved. She sat
right across the aisle from me.

1066
01:13:01,078 --> 01:13:03,012
So we started to talk.

1067
01:13:03,214 --> 01:13:05,409
She didn't like me much at first.

1068
01:13:05,616 --> 01:13:06,777
She's super smart...

1069
01:13:07,451 --> 01:13:09,682
very passionate...

1070
01:13:10,254 --> 01:13:11,448
and beautiful.

1071
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:15,480
And I was so unsure of myself.

1072
01:13:15,793 --> 01:13:18,523
I thought everything I said
sounded so stupid.

1073
01:13:20,397 --> 01:13:23,423
Oh, man. I wouldn't worry about that.

1074
01:13:24,034 --> 01:13:26,297
No, I'm sure she was not judging you.

1075
01:13:26,804 --> 01:13:29,102
No, and by the way,
she sat next to you.

1076
01:13:29,306 --> 01:13:31,034
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

1077
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:32,572
Oh, yeah?

1078
01:13:36,346 --> 01:13:40,146
Us men are so stupid. We don't
understand anything about women.

1079
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:43,909
They act strange,
the little I know of them.

1080
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:45,818
Don't they?

1081
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:56,764
I feel like this is
some dream world we're in.

1082
01:13:56,967 --> 01:13:58,558
Yeah, it's so weird.

1083
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,164
It's like our time together
is just ours.

1084
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:03,201
It's our own creation.

1085
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,966
It must be like I'm in your dream
and you're in mine.

1086
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:11,143
And what's so cool
is that this whole evening...

1087
01:14:11,347 --> 01:14:14,839
all our time together,
shouldn't officially be happening.

1088
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:18,509
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why
this feels so otherworldly.

1089
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:24,218
But then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins, right?

1090
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,393
I know.

1091
01:14:27,531 --> 01:14:30,327
But now, you're supposed to
produce the glass slipper...

1092
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:32,125
and see if it fits.

1093
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:36,636
It'll fit.

1094
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:56,853
<i>This friend of mine had a kid...</i>

1095
01:14:57,058 --> 01:15:00,289
and it was a home birth,
so he was there helping out.

1096
01:15:00,495 --> 01:15:03,293
But he said at that
profound moment of birth...

1097
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:08,532
he was watching his child
experiencing life for the first time...

1098
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,671
trying to take its first breath.

1099
01:15:10,872 --> 01:15:14,399
All he could think about was
that he was looking at something...

1100
01:15:14,609 --> 01:15:16,635
that was gonna die someday.

1101
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:19,071
He couldn't get it out of his head.

1102
01:15:19,814 --> 01:15:23,409
And I think that's so true.
Everything is so finite.

1103
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,449
But don't you think that's what...

1104
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:29,987
makes our time and specific moments
so important?

1105
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,056
Yeah, I know.

1106
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:33,586
It's the same for us tonight, though.

1107
01:15:36,564 --> 01:15:40,228
After tomorrow, we'll probably
never see each other again, right?

1108
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,365
You don't think we'll
ever see each other?

1109
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,303
What do you think?

1110
01:15:54,648 --> 01:15:56,172
Actually, I don't know.

1111
01:15:57,251 --> 01:15:58,479
I hadn't planned another...

1112
01:15:58,686 --> 01:16:02,247
Me too. I live in Paris,
you live in the U.S. I understand.

1113
01:16:02,456 --> 01:16:05,221
I'd hate to make you fly.
You'd hate to fly, right?

1114
01:16:05,593 --> 01:16:07,653
I'm not so scared of flying.

1115
01:16:08,529 --> 01:16:09,752
I mean, I could.

1116
01:16:09,763 --> 01:16:11,458
Well, if you were gonna...

1117
01:16:11,732 --> 01:16:13,256
come to the U.S...

1118
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,899
or if, you know, if I...

1119
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,536
I mean, I could come back here.

1120
01:16:18,605 --> 01:16:19,766
What?

1121
01:16:20,608 --> 01:16:23,838
No, let's just be rational adults
about this.

1122
01:16:26,779 --> 01:16:28,474
We should try something different.

1123
01:16:28,682 --> 01:16:31,912
It's not so bad if tonight
is our only night, right?

1124
01:16:33,219 --> 01:16:35,120
People exchange numbers, addresses.

1125
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:38,155
They end up writing once,
calling each other twice.

1126
01:16:38,358 --> 01:16:40,121
Right. Fizzles out.

1127
01:16:40,427 --> 01:16:42,918
Yeah, I don't want that.
I hate that.

1128
01:16:43,929 --> 01:16:45,523
I hate that too.

1129
01:16:46,132 --> 01:16:49,432
Why does everybody think
relationships should last forever?

1130
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:51,762
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

1131
01:16:53,573 --> 01:16:56,167
But you think tonight's it?

1132
01:16:56,442 --> 01:16:59,934
I mean, that tonight's our only night?

1133
01:17:01,948 --> 01:17:04,007
It's the only way, no?

1134
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,451
Well, all right.

1135
01:17:09,989 --> 01:17:11,250
Let's do it.

1136
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,923
No delusions, no projections.

1137
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:17,319
We'll just make tonight great.

1138
01:17:20,032 --> 01:17:21,227
Let's do that.

1139
01:17:38,718 --> 01:17:40,948
We should do some kind of handshake.

1140
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:42,683
Give me your hand.

1141
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:49,094
To our one and only...

1142
01:17:49,928 --> 01:17:51,418
night together...

1143
01:17:52,164 --> 01:17:54,724
and the hours that remain.

1144
01:18:03,342 --> 01:18:04,492
What?

1145
01:18:07,179 --> 01:18:08,476
It's just...

1146
01:18:08,847 --> 01:18:10,644
It's depressing, no?

1147
01:18:11,649 --> 01:18:14,414
Now, the only thing
we're gonna think of is...

1148
01:18:14,618 --> 01:18:16,552
when we'll have to say goodbye.

1149
01:18:17,355 --> 01:18:20,348
We could say goodbye now.
Then we won't worry about it.

1150
01:18:20,759 --> 01:18:21,909
Now?

1151
01:18:22,694 --> 01:18:23,853
Say goodbye.

1152
01:18:24,062 --> 01:18:25,552
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1153
01:18:27,132 --> 01:18:28,099
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1154
01:18:28,299 --> 01:18:30,063
- Later.
- Later, yeah.

1155
01:19:00,398 --> 01:19:01,548
Here's the plan.

1156
01:19:01,665 --> 01:19:04,963
You're gonna grab the glasses,
and I'm gonna get the wine.

1157
01:19:05,469 --> 01:19:07,163
- Red wine.
- Red wine. Right.

1158
01:19:07,371 --> 01:19:10,498
- You think you can do that?
- No problem.

1159
01:19:15,311 --> 01:19:17,576
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

1160
01:19:19,517 --> 01:19:20,667
Hello.

1161
01:19:25,155 --> 01:19:26,452
Do you speak English?

1162
01:19:26,657 --> 01:19:28,715
- A bit.
- Yeah? A bit?

1163
01:19:28,926 --> 01:19:31,554
I'm having kind of an odd situation...

1164
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:33,558
which is that...

1165
01:19:33,897 --> 01:19:35,832
You see that girl over there?

1166
01:19:40,236 --> 01:19:42,705
Well, this is our only night together...

1167
01:19:43,373 --> 01:19:44,897
and she...

1168
01:19:46,976 --> 01:19:50,275
The problem is that she wants
a bottle of red wine...

1169
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,640
and I don't have any money.

1170
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:57,519
But I was thinking
that you might want to...

1171
01:19:58,555 --> 01:20:02,115
give me the address of this bar,
and I would promise...

1172
01:20:02,524 --> 01:20:05,961
to send you the money, and you'd
be making our night complete.

1173
01:20:06,162 --> 01:20:08,095
You would send me the money?

1174
01:20:14,203 --> 01:20:15,465
Your hand?

1175
01:20:31,654 --> 01:20:34,019
For the greatest night in your life.

1176
01:20:34,223 --> 01:20:35,919
Thank you very much.

1177
01:20:59,615 --> 01:21:03,210
So often I've been with people
and shared beautiful moments...

1178
01:21:03,418 --> 01:21:07,478
like traveling or staying up
all night and watching the sunrise.

1179
01:21:08,356 --> 01:21:10,916
And I knew those were special moments.

1180
01:21:11,526 --> 01:21:13,757
But something was always wrong.

1181
01:21:14,896 --> 01:21:17,127
I wished I'd been with someone else.

1182
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:21,062
I knew that what I was feeling...

1183
01:21:21,269 --> 01:21:25,331
exactly what was so important to me,
they didn't understand.

1184
01:21:30,011 --> 01:21:32,002
But I'm happy to be with you.

1185
01:21:34,749 --> 01:21:37,216
You couldn't know
why a night like this...

1186
01:21:37,419 --> 01:21:39,909
is so important
to my life right now...

1187
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,520
but it is.

1188
01:21:44,625 --> 01:21:46,592
This is a great morning.

1189
01:21:47,161 --> 01:21:48,924
It is a great morning.

1190
01:21:51,233 --> 01:21:53,530
Do you think we have others like this?

1191
01:21:56,503 --> 01:21:59,632
What about our rational, adult decision?

1192
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,501
Oh, yeah.

1193
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:09,111
I know what you mean about wishing
somebody wasn't there.

1194
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:12,085
It's just, usually, it's myself...

1195
01:22:12,286 --> 01:22:14,446
that I wish I could get away from.

1196
01:22:15,089 --> 01:22:16,989
Seriously, think about this.

1197
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:19,720
I have never been anywhere...

1198
01:22:19,927 --> 01:22:21,621
that I haven't been.

1199
01:22:22,162 --> 01:22:24,494
I've never had a kiss...

1200
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:26,723
when I wasn't one of the kissers.

1201
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:28,798
You know, I've never...

1202
01:22:29,003 --> 01:22:32,233
gone to the movies when
I wasn't there in the audience.

1203
01:22:32,439 --> 01:22:35,034
I've never been out bowling
if I wasn't there...

1204
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:36,799
making some stupid joke.

1205
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:39,910
That's why so many people
hate themselves. Seriously.

1206
01:22:40,113 --> 01:22:42,240
It's just, they are sick to death...

1207
01:22:42,448 --> 01:22:44,713
of being around themselves.

1208
01:22:45,485 --> 01:22:49,182
Let's say that you and I
were together all the time.

1209
01:22:49,389 --> 01:22:51,619
You'd start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms.

1210
01:22:52,225 --> 01:22:53,556
The way...

1211
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,991
the way every time
that we would have people over...

1212
01:22:57,597 --> 01:23:00,828
I'd be insecure, and I'd get
a little too drunk.

1213
01:23:01,635 --> 01:23:05,400
Or the way I tell the same stupid,
pseudo-intellectual story...

1214
01:23:05,605 --> 01:23:07,367
again and again.

1215
01:23:09,108 --> 01:23:11,269
You see, I've heard
all those stories...

1216
01:23:11,544 --> 01:23:14,172
so of course I'm sick of myself.

1217
01:23:18,318 --> 01:23:19,808
But being with you...

1218
01:23:22,054 --> 01:23:24,716
it's made me feel like
I was somebody else.

1219
01:23:26,325 --> 01:23:30,421
I mean, the only other way
to lose yourself like that is...

1220
01:23:31,296 --> 01:23:33,527
you know, dancing...

1221
01:23:33,899 --> 01:23:35,833
or alcohol...

1222
01:23:36,468 --> 01:23:39,334
or drugs, or stuff like that.

1223
01:23:41,873 --> 01:23:43,135
Fucking.

1224
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:47,538
Fucking, yeah. That's one way.

1225
01:24:01,893 --> 01:24:03,656
Do you know what I want?

1226
01:24:04,863 --> 01:24:06,160
What?

1227
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,092
To be kissed.

1228
01:24:14,405 --> 01:24:16,033
Well, I could do that.

1229
01:24:30,021 --> 01:24:31,171
Wait.

1230
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:37,325
I have to say something stupid.

1231
01:24:38,963 --> 01:24:40,113
All right.

1232
01:24:41,466 --> 01:24:43,093
It's very stupid.

1233
01:24:46,236 --> 01:24:48,397
I don't think we should
sleep together.

1234
01:24:50,741 --> 01:24:55,202
I want to, but since we're never
going to see each other again...

1235
01:24:55,413 --> 01:24:57,312
it'll make me feel bad.

1236
01:24:58,215 --> 01:25:00,945
I'll wonder who else you're with.
I'll miss you.

1237
01:25:06,357 --> 01:25:08,824
I know. It's not very adult.

1238
01:25:09,025 --> 01:25:11,893
Maybe it's a female thing.
I can't help it.

1239
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:14,260
Let's see each other again.

1240
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,993
No, I don't want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid.

1241
01:25:21,538 --> 01:25:25,474
I don't want to just get laid.
I want to... I mean...

1242
01:25:25,942 --> 01:25:28,103
I mean, I think we should.

1243
01:25:29,211 --> 01:25:31,372
We die in the morning, right?

1244
01:25:32,782 --> 01:25:35,717
- I think we should.
- Then it's like some male fantasy.

1245
01:25:35,919 --> 01:25:39,116
Meet a French girl,
fuck her and never see her again.

1246
01:25:39,322 --> 01:25:42,917
And have this great story to tell.
I don't want...

1247
01:25:43,126 --> 01:25:45,856
this great evening to
just have been for that.

1248
01:25:46,696 --> 01:25:50,223
Okay, we don't have to have sex.
It's not a big deal.

1249
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:03,078
You don't want to see me again?

1250
01:26:04,513 --> 01:26:05,775
No, of course I do.

1251
01:26:05,981 --> 01:26:08,575
If somebody gave me
the choice right now...

1252
01:26:08,784 --> 01:26:11,686
of to never see you again
or to marry you...

1253
01:26:11,921 --> 01:26:13,071
I would marry you.

1254
01:26:13,222 --> 01:26:15,383
Maybe that's a lot
of romantic bullshit...

1255
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:18,320
but people have gotten married
for a lot less.

1256
01:26:21,764 --> 01:26:22,914
Actually...

1257
01:26:24,601 --> 01:26:29,334
I think I decided I wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train.

1258
01:26:32,975 --> 01:26:35,876
Now that we've talked so much,
I don't know anymore.

1259
01:26:46,722 --> 01:26:49,053
Why do we make everything
so complicated?

1260
01:26:49,258 --> 01:26:50,748
I don't know.

1261
01:27:52,552 --> 01:27:56,283
What's the first thing you'll do
when you get back to Paris?

1262
01:27:56,757 --> 01:27:58,315
Call my parents.

1263
01:27:58,558 --> 01:27:59,923
What about you?

1264
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:04,390
I don't know. I'll probably go
pick up my dog. He's with a friend.

1265
01:28:04,598 --> 01:28:06,031
You have a dog?
I love dogs.

1266
01:28:06,233 --> 01:28:07,859
- You do?
- Yeah.

1267
01:28:08,201 --> 01:28:10,101
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1268
01:28:11,139 --> 01:28:13,698
I don't know.
We're back in real time.

1269
01:28:14,107 --> 01:28:15,801
I know. I hate that.

1270
01:28:16,142 --> 01:28:17,440
What is that?

1271
01:28:19,512 --> 01:28:21,538
Sounds like a harpsichord.

1272
01:28:22,014 --> 01:28:23,642
Check that out.

1273
01:28:24,017 --> 01:28:25,814
Somebody's playing.

1274
01:28:32,591 --> 01:28:33,741
That's cool.

1275
01:28:52,211 --> 01:28:54,476
Can we dance to the harpsichord?

1276
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,045
Of course.

1277
01:28:59,986 --> 01:29:01,136
Oh, wow.

1278
01:29:05,324 --> 01:29:06,985
I'm gonna take your picture...

1279
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,251
so I never forget you...

1280
01:29:12,565 --> 01:29:13,827
or all this.

1281
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,227
Okay, me too.

1282
01:30:14,626 --> 01:30:18,083
"The years shall run like rabbits."

1283
01:30:20,633 --> 01:30:21,783
What?

1284
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,165
Nothing.

1285
01:30:27,072 --> 01:30:28,833
I have...

1286
01:30:29,339 --> 01:30:31,500
this recording of Dylan Thomas...

1287
01:30:31,776 --> 01:30:33,767
reading a W.H. Auden poem.

1288
01:30:33,977 --> 01:30:36,639
He's got a great voice.

1289
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:39,777
It's like...

1290
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:43,314
"All the clocks in the city

1291
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,319
Began to whirr and chime:

1292
01:30:46,556 --> 01:30:49,047
"O let not Time deceive you

1293
01:30:49,259 --> 01:30:51,853
"You cannot conquer Time.

1294
01:30:52,196 --> 01:30:54,289
"In headaches and in worry

1295
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:57,532
"Vaguely life leaks away

1296
01:30:57,733 --> 01:30:59,963
"And Time will have his fancy

1297
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:02,763
"Tomorrow or today."

1298
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:04,966
Something like that.

1299
01:31:05,942 --> 01:31:07,136
That's good.

1300
01:31:14,751 --> 01:31:18,619
When you talked earlier
about after a few years...

1301
01:31:18,821 --> 01:31:21,450
how a couple would begin
to hate each other...

1302
01:31:21,658 --> 01:31:23,626
by anticipating their reactions...

1303
01:31:23,826 --> 01:31:25,852
or getting tired
of their mannerisms.

1304
01:31:26,596 --> 01:31:28,962
I think it would be
the opposite for me.

1305
01:31:30,133 --> 01:31:34,468
I think I can really fall in love
when I know everything about someone.

1306
01:31:35,706 --> 01:31:37,367
The way he's gonna part his hair...

1307
01:31:37,574 --> 01:31:39,700
which shirt he's gonna
wear that day...

1308
01:31:39,909 --> 01:31:44,141
knowing the exact story he'd tell
in a given situation.

1309
01:31:45,848 --> 01:31:48,372
I'm sure that's when I know
I'm really in love.

1310
01:32:10,039 --> 01:32:12,371
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

1311
01:32:12,742 --> 01:32:14,709
We didn't go to those guys' play.

1312
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:16,139
Play?

1313
01:32:16,344 --> 01:32:17,676
The cow?

1314
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,609
Oh, yeah, we didn't.

1315
01:32:19,814 --> 01:32:22,045
Oh, no. We missed it.

1316
01:32:47,741 --> 01:32:49,734
You know what bus to take
to the airport?

1317
01:32:49,944 --> 01:32:50,843
No problem.

1318
01:32:51,047 --> 01:32:54,447
- I should get on this one.
- Right here. You wanna get on there?

1319
01:32:58,253 --> 01:33:00,186
I guess this is it, no?

1320
01:33:01,855 --> 01:33:03,345
I really...

1321
01:33:08,729 --> 01:33:11,061
- You know...
- Yeah, I know. Me too.

1322
01:33:17,705 --> 01:33:21,196
Have a great life. Have fun
with everything you're gonna do.

1323
01:33:21,408 --> 01:33:23,774
Good luck with school and all that.

1324
01:33:25,179 --> 01:33:26,704
I hate this.

1325
01:33:27,381 --> 01:33:29,906
Me too.
The train is about to leave.

1326
01:33:37,726 --> 01:33:40,421
You know all this bullshit
we're talking about...

1327
01:33:40,627 --> 01:33:43,187
not seeing each other?
I don't want that.

1328
01:33:43,397 --> 01:33:44,591
I don't either.

1329
01:33:44,798 --> 01:33:46,356
- You don't?
- I waited for you to say it.

1330
01:33:46,567 --> 01:33:48,125
Why didn't you say something?

1331
01:33:48,334 --> 01:33:50,496
I was afraid
you didn't wanna see me.

1332
01:33:50,704 --> 01:33:51,966
What do you wanna do?

1333
01:33:53,107 --> 01:33:56,075
Maybe we should meet here
in five years or something.

1334
01:33:56,276 --> 01:33:58,472
Five years? That's a long time.

1335
01:33:58,679 --> 01:34:02,114
It's awful. It's like
a sociological experiment.

1336
01:34:02,349 --> 01:34:04,340
- How about one year?
- One year.

1337
01:34:05,252 --> 01:34:07,345
- How about six months?
- Six months?

1338
01:34:08,222 --> 01:34:09,985
It's gonna be freezing.

1339
01:34:10,189 --> 01:34:12,851
Who cares? We come here,
we go somewhere else.

1340
01:34:16,029 --> 01:34:17,963
Six months from now or last night?

1341
01:34:19,432 --> 01:34:23,095
Last night. Six months
from last night, which was...

1342
01:34:23,369 --> 01:34:24,632
June 16th.

1343
01:34:24,837 --> 01:34:29,366
So track nine, six months from now
at 6:00 at night.

1344
01:34:29,574 --> 01:34:30,724
December.

1345
01:34:31,277 --> 01:34:34,645
It's a train ride for you,
but I gotta fly all the way here.

1346
01:34:34,847 --> 01:34:36,314
But I'm gonna be here.

1347
01:34:36,516 --> 01:34:38,814
- Okay, me too.
- All right.

1348
01:34:40,553 --> 01:34:42,111
We won't call, write or...

1349
01:34:42,322 --> 01:34:43,754
No, it's depressing.

1350
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:48,823
Your train's gonna leave.

1351
01:34:49,028 --> 01:34:50,655
Say goodbye.

1352
01:34:51,364 --> 01:34:52,514
Bye.

1353
01:34:53,533 --> 01:34:54,726
Goodbye.

1354
01:34:55,867 --> 01:34:57,061
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1355
01:34:58,538 --> 01:34:59,697
Later.
