1
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:55,513
Not so fast

2
00:01:57,724 --> 00:01:58,782
Come on

3
00:02:23,483 --> 00:02:25,007
Climb Fatso, climb.

4
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:27,416
Don't fall on us or we'll die.

5
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:28,945
l'm slipping

6
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:30,751
Put your foot here.

7
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:32,416
Now go.

8
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,621
Go on you cow...

9
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:41,433
Careful

10
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,447
Easy...

11
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:03,516
Fatso, you eat too much.

12
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,524
l got tired giving him a leg up.

13
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:07,457
You're no less...

14
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:09,722
Did you see yourself?

15
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:12,060
At least l did it on my own.

16
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,792
He almost crushed us.

17
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:17,667
Did you see his legs
dangling in mid air?

18
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:18,995
l'm hungry...

19
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:22,007
Forget it fatso. We're already late.

20
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:29,012
Thanks to this idiot,
l've started pronouncing it

21
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:30,549
'Filum' instead of film.

22
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:31,811
Walk on the side.

23
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:33,011
Four tickets please...

24
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:34,885
Quickly, give me your money.

25
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,088
Here...
- Twenty...

26
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:39,749
My twenty...

27
00:03:39,826 --> 00:03:41,487
You?
- Don't have any...

28
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,495
You're so cheap...

29
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:44,889
Why are you always like this?

30
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:46,488
Keeps eating, that's why...

31
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:47,624
Lets go, quick...

32
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,497
Hurry hurry...

33
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:52,494
lt's just started.

34
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,706
Look at those...

35
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:07,043
Here Fatso.

36
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:17,058
This is a grape...

37
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,521
A very ripe grape...

38
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,527
Her name is 'Desire'

39
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,530
And she desires...

40
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:30,266
A young and handsome man...

41
00:04:30,543 --> 00:04:31,601
Look at that...

42
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:34,146
Who will love her...

43
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:37,812
And enjoy the juice of this grape.

44
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:00,970
What a beauty...

45
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:05,567
Look behind...
- Why?

46
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:06,703
There's another movie going on.

47
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:13,575
Where's your wife?

48
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:14,711
Uncle!

49
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:22,185
Excuse me.

50
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:23,720
Yes?

51
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,791
You are very beautiful...

52
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:27,127
Oh Shit!
- What?

53
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,998
lt's Mr. Rathod. The Moustache.

54
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:33,596
Run! lt's the Moustache.

55
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,607
Bengali get up.

56
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:39,610
Look who it is...

57
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,938
Stop!

58
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,607
Run Fatso! Run fast.

59
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,141
Stop!

60
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:46,617
Come on, fast!

61
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:47,812
Stop! Benoy...

62
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:50,879
Benoy... Rohan...

63
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:55,890
What was Moustache doing there?

64
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:57,623
Watching the movie, what else?

65
00:05:57,697 --> 00:05:59,028
Did he recognize us?

66
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:00,622
He was calling you
by your name, idiot!

67
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,031
Benoy... Benoy...

68
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:03,693
Oh shit! He has a moped.

69
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,635
Should've punctured the tyres.

70
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:07,036
Why didn't you think of that before?

71
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:08,630
What if he complains?

72
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:12,036
lf we reach school before
him he can't do anything.

73
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,238
Run. Come on, run Manu...

74
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:15,837
This time we're dead.

75
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:18,042
Don't think too much...

76
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:22,783
What happened?
- Lets see...

77
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:24,314
Don't...

78
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,658
He twisted his ankle.

79
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:28,318
And no one here to
straighten it out.

80
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:29,725
Shut up Bengali.

81
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:33,197
You guys carry on.
l'll get back on my own.

82
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:34,995
How? Will you fly?

83
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:36,729
Moustache will get you expelled.

84
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:38,998
And he'll throw you a parade?

85
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:41,863
Come on, lift him up.

86
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:45,735
Walk slowly...

87
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:50,278
Slowly...

88
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:53,810
Gently...

89
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,220
Oh Shit!

90
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:06,356
Run

91
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:07,694
Come on. Hurry!

92
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,691
Benoy... do something...

93
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:11,760
Fatso lift his leg...

94
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:13,703
Hurry, you fat cow.

95
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:15,707
Run run run

96
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:25,843
See you at school!

97
00:07:31,724 --> 00:07:32,782
He's gone...

98
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:02,345
What did you do, Junior?

99
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:04,286
Didn't finish my tasks.

100
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:05,815
That's it?

101
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:07,018
They sent you to Heady for that?

102
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:09,089
And what did you do?

103
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:11,422
Went to town for a film last night.

104
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:12,822
Then?

105
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:14,760
He broke his leg.

106
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:15,892
So?

107
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,367
Our luck ran out...

108
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,828
Now?

109
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:20,296
Don't know...

110
00:08:22,175 --> 00:08:23,767
You got caught?

111
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:26,372
No. We're here to kiss Heady.

112
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:29,305
What will your father do?

113
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:33,051
Break whatever bones l have left.

114
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,111
My father will send me to
my grandmother in Singur...

115
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:37,781
to study in a government school...

116
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,119
if it still exists...

117
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:42,060
My father will be reading the news...

118
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:44,062
He'll ask, ''You're home?''

119
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:46,331
l'll say, ''Yes, it's vacation time''.

120
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,798
He'll ask, ''When do you go back?''

121
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:48,925
l'll say, ''When they phone.''

122
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:50,326
So?

123
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:51,870
We don't have a phone at home.

124
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,198
And you?

125
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:57,400
Rohan...

126
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,802
The boy is asking what
your father will do.

127
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:08,411
No idea...

128
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:10,885
l haven't seen him for eight years.

129
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,348
Why?

130
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:39,309
What was the name?

131
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:41,377
Whose name sir?

132
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,248
Name of the film.

133
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:51,921
Rohan?

134
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:53,923
Sir?

135
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:57,460
Kanti Shah's ''Grapes.''

136
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:03,933
Last year you left
all the taps running...

137
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:07,275
We had to evacuate the whole hostel.

138
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:09,871
No sir, that was two years ago...

139
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:11,940
Last year it was the fans...

140
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:14,410
Sorry sir.

141
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:16,887
l just spoke to your father Muninder.

142
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:18,014
We got a phone at home?

143
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,216
Shut up!

144
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:23,292
What did my father say?

145
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:24,886
He's coming to get you himself.

146
00:10:26,365 --> 00:10:27,491
He's going to kill me sir.

147
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:30,160
Please... one last chance...

148
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:32,101
Stand straight.

149
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:33,296
Yes

150
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:36,500
This is the third
time you've been caught.

151
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,170
Your parents have been informed.

152
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:42,908
They're waiting for you at home.

153
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:45,245
You are expelled.

154
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:47,309
No Sir please Sir.

155
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:48,910
Dismissed. All of you.

156
00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:56,452
Rohan...

157
00:10:58,464 --> 00:10:59,522
l'm sorry.

158
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:09,132
Excuse me sir?

159
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,937
Please ask Mr.
Rathod who the lady was?

160
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,945
The one whose blouse
he had his hand in?

161
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:15,471
Please sir.

162
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:21,477
Where's Rohan?

163
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:23,479
There he is...

164
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:06,522
Scared?

165
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:12,596
We had to leave sometime...

166
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:15,204
Couldn't stay in school forever...

167
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:27,343
Want to hear a poem?

168
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:29,745
Sure...

169
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,021
Tiny scattered moments,

170
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:38,029
Sprinkled on the garden of memories.

171
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:41,226
Strolling, bare foot, on them,

172
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,164
lt feels we've wandered too far...

173
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:46,300
Now we can't remember,
where we left our shoes.

174
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:50,438
Our heels were soft when we got here,

175
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:53,306
They still feel tender.

176
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:55,104
And they will remain fragile,

177
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:58,440
Till those bittersweet memories,

178
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:01,042
Keep tingling them.

179
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:05,448
True, we've forgotten,

180
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:07,048
Where we left our shoes...

181
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:12,530
But now it seems, we
don't need them anymore.

182
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:29,605
Liked it?

183
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:37,146
Did you understand it?

184
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:04,439
We should've watched
the whole film...

185
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:07,176
Come to Bombay.

186
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:09,721
l'll show you
Paris Hilton's sex tape.

187
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:25,663
l'll miss you guys...

188
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:27,205
We too, pal.

189
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,207
Okay, then..

190
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:33,211
Take care..

191
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:36,339
You look after yourself.

192
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:37,541
You too

193
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:44,281
Take care, man.

194
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:11,513
Take him home carefully, Moustache.

195
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:20,590
Does your wife know about the woman
whose blouse you had your hand in?

196
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,718
ldiot...

197
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,588
What?

198
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:26,922
Go.

199
00:15:30,603 --> 00:15:37,202
The beauty has vanished

200
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:46,617
Like smoke into thin air.

201
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:57,223
Then, we were lost in our dreams,

202
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:07,762
Now we face the unknown.

203
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:21,911
ls life over?.

204
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:27,789
Or is it about to begin?

205
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,525
ls this nightfall?

206
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:37,661
Or is it a new dawn?

207
00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:40,466
ls life over?.

208
00:16:40,873 --> 00:16:47,278
Or is it about to begin?

209
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:51,282
ls this nightfall?

210
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,810
Or is it a new dawn?

211
00:16:56,288 --> 00:17:02,887
Will the future bring comfort?

212
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:14,296
Or will bring us to a crossroad?

213
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:23,908
Who knows what lies ahead ...

214
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:10,624
Has come on platform no. 2.

215
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:40,628
That's my bed.

216
00:21:56,054 --> 00:21:57,112
Who is he?

217
00:21:58,056 --> 00:21:59,114
Your brother.

218
00:21:59,191 --> 00:22:00,658
My brother?

219
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,789
After your mother died..

220
00:22:04,796 --> 00:22:06,195
l got married again.

221
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:08,327
lt didn't work out...

222
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,658
Move ..

223
00:22:29,221 --> 00:22:30,620
Get up.

224
00:22:30,689 --> 00:22:31,747
This is my bed.

225
00:22:31,823 --> 00:22:35,623
Get up or l'll whack you so hard
you'll go to the bathroom and cry.

226
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:37,019
Get up!

227
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:00,843
Come here.

228
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:06,647
This is my cupboard.

229
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:11,662
Listen pipsqueak. This cupboard
was mine before you were born...

230
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,667
Now that l'm back, this cupboard,
this table, this bed...

231
00:23:16,735 --> 00:23:18,669
Everything is mine.
Nothing is yours.

232
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:20,865
What is your name?

233
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:21,997
Arjun

234
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,321
Go and get him.

235
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,141
Sir is calling you.

236
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:41,410
Sir?

237
00:24:41,753 --> 00:24:43,084
You call Papa 'Sir'?

238
00:24:44,823 --> 00:24:46,154
Tell 'Sir' that l'm coming.

239
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:08,776
l'm coming.

240
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:10,178
Sir is getting angry.

241
00:25:32,337 --> 00:25:35,795
Next time you'll have no hair left.

242
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:51,213
Little brother...

243
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:52,347
Big Brother...

244
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:53,891
Coming. Coming.

245
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:57,087
You're slow...

246
00:25:58,363 --> 00:25:59,830
Good evening Uncle.

247
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:00,956
Here...

248
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,357
Here also...

249
00:26:05,437 --> 00:26:06,836
And who is this?

250
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,363
As big as your uncle...

251
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:10,499
Hello.

252
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:13,237
His voice broke...

253
00:26:14,045 --> 00:26:15,103
Good evening Auntie.

254
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,238
Good evening.

255
00:26:16,314 --> 00:26:17,906
He is so handsome!

256
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:19,382
Handsome my ass

257
00:26:19,985 --> 00:26:21,384
Good evening to Auntie,

258
00:26:21,453 --> 00:26:23,250
And only a 'hello' for me?

259
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:24,845
Well done...

260
00:26:25,257 --> 00:26:27,452
Where is my hug?

261
00:26:30,395 --> 00:26:31,987
Good to see you.

262
00:26:32,063 --> 00:26:33,121
Listen...

263
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:35,860
Heard you were a bad boy at school...

264
00:26:37,202 --> 00:26:38,260
Who was she?

265
00:26:38,336 --> 00:26:39,394
Nobody.

266
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:41,871
l went to see a film with friends.

267
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,134
At Rivoli?
- Yes.

268
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,073
We used to see lots of films there.

269
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:46,537
Good one?

270
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:48,875
Don't know. We had to run back.
- Why

271
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:50,873
Our warden was there.

272
00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:52,007
Who?

273
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,141
Rathod.

274
00:26:53,218 --> 00:26:54,480
Big moustache.
- Yes.

275
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:56,213
Who made him a warden?

276
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:57,949
He used to be a peon.

277
00:26:58,023 --> 00:26:59,888
Not him... His son.

278
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,892
He has a moustache too?

279
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,018
Yes.

280
00:27:03,094 --> 00:27:04,959
Come in. Our moustache is watching.

281
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,492
So big man

282
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:08,490
What now?

283
00:27:08,566 --> 00:27:09,897
College
- College!

284
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:12,096
Everyone goes to college.

285
00:27:12,304 --> 00:27:13,965
What will you study?

286
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,166
Arts, Literature.

287
00:27:16,241 --> 00:27:17,435
Why not science?

288
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:18,976
l want to be a writer.

289
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:20,102
Wow!

290
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:21,304
What will you write?

291
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:25,042
Poems, novels, stories, or jokes?

292
00:27:25,116 --> 00:27:26,174
Everything

293
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:27,309
Nothing.

294
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:31,914
He'll write nothing

295
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:36,123
He will study engineering
and work in my factory.

296
00:27:37,262 --> 00:27:41,528
He wants to study literature.

297
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,328
What's wrong with that?

298
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:47,462
Writers are respected these days.

299
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:49,200
Respect won't feed him...

300
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:51,932
Writers only grow
their hair like girls,

301
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,944
wear a kurta, carry a bag...

302
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:55,946
And think they're brilliant.

303
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:58,005
But they're not.

304
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,942
Then they die. Either from hunger.

305
00:28:02,354 --> 00:28:04,219
Or as frustrated alcoholics.

306
00:28:05,357 --> 00:28:11,159
lf he lives in my house
he has to obey my rules.

307
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:13,294
l don't want to work in a factory.

308
00:28:13,365 --> 00:28:14,423
Did l ask for your opinion?

309
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:17,093
Did anyone?

310
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:20,963
What are you staring at?

311
00:28:22,173 --> 00:28:24,971
l'll whack you so hard your
eyes will fall in your plate.

312
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,239
Lower your eyes and eat your food.

313
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:40,382
See how cheeky he is Jimmy?

314
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:43,385
What would our father have done,

315
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:44,985
lf we had behaved like this.

316
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:48,589
He would've melted our bones
along with steel in the furnace.

317
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:53,134
And if we'd been kicked out
of the best school in lndia...

318
00:28:53,538 --> 00:28:55,062
Do you know what he would have done?

319
00:28:55,407 --> 00:29:02,006
We'd be out on the streets
till we proved our worth.

320
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,345
lf you don't behave yourself

321
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:06,077
l'll treat you the same way.

322
00:29:06,618 --> 00:29:11,282
At least your father would've
met you once in eight years...

323
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,217
No, no...

324
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:16,351
He's just a child...

325
00:29:16,428 --> 00:29:18,089
Child? He's insolent.

326
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:19,221
Let me go...

327
00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:20,355
Hardly has a moustache..

328
00:29:20,432 --> 00:29:23,026
And talks back to his father.

329
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:25,035
l'm talking to you...

330
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,097
How dare you...

331
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:31,039
Stop, Stop ... You'll kill him.

332
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:34,101
Let him go...

333
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:44,587
Enough.

334
00:30:11,082 --> 00:30:12,481
Why do you talk to him like that?

335
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,075
He doesn't understand any other way.

336
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:19,150
He brought you into this world.

337
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:20,282
Mummy did that...

338
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:22,286
He is your father.

339
00:30:22,494 --> 00:30:24,155
What kind of a father is he?

340
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:27,359
He abandoned me for eight years...

341
00:30:27,632 --> 00:30:33,366
One letter a year which
sounded like the news on TV.

342
00:30:33,638 --> 00:30:37,096
''Everything is fine here.
l got your results...

343
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:38,369
''... you could do better.''

344
00:30:39,444 --> 00:30:41,378
l had even forgotten his face...

345
00:30:42,113 --> 00:30:45,310
Saw him at the station
and wondered who he was...

346
00:30:47,118 --> 00:30:50,110
l'm his son, not a
fixed deposit in a bank.

347
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:56,518
l'll clean toilets all my life
but l won't work for him.

348
00:31:05,803 --> 00:31:07,794
Come on, get up.

349
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:18,544
Every father wants his son to
grow up to be just like himself.

350
00:31:20,552 --> 00:31:22,213
Give him a chance.

351
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:24,348
He might understand.

352
00:31:27,492 --> 00:31:30,484
l know that you'll do
whatever it is you want...

353
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,357
But first stand on your feet.

354
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,164
Then be whatever you want to
be; Write or clean toilets.

355
00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:44,566
Come...

356
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:46,906
The food's getting cold...

357
00:31:48,513 --> 00:31:51,175
Come. For my sake...

358
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,511
You can't deny a fat man his food...

359
00:31:55,587 --> 00:31:58,454
l'm starving.

360
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:20,200
Bring Arjun upstairs.

361
00:32:32,557 --> 00:32:36,220
Arjun get up.

362
00:32:38,229 --> 00:32:39,355
Arjun get up.

363
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:54,238
Let's get some facts straight...

364
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,638
This is my house...

365
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:01,241
lf you stay here, you will
have to live by my rules.

366
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,378
First rule-

367
00:33:05,323 --> 00:33:08,656
Call me Sir as Arjun does.

368
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:13,655
What did you call
your seniors at school?

369
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,262
Sir

370
00:33:18,803 --> 00:33:21,601
What happened at Jimmy's
should never happen again.

371
00:33:22,674 --> 00:33:24,335
You will never...

372
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:28,278
Ever misbehave with me again...

373
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,271
You will not raise your voice...

374
00:33:32,617 --> 00:33:35,279
And you will only do as l say.

375
00:33:36,354 --> 00:33:37,412
Understood?

376
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:40,355
Okay

377
00:33:40,425 --> 00:33:41,483
The word is 'Yes'

378
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:45,353
Yes

379

Yes what?

380
00:33:50,635 --> 00:33:51,693
Yes Sir

381
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:58,298
Give up your dreams of
being a writer.

382
00:33:58,843 --> 00:34:01,573
lt will not happen.

383
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:03,640
Stop flying.

384
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:05,707
Keep your feet on the ground.

385
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:08,710
Do you understand me?

386
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:10,779
Yes Sir.

387
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:12,914
You will come to the
factory with me from tomorrow.

388
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:17,456
You'll work there till lunch
then leave for engineering college.

389
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,324
Thanks to your school record...

390
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:25,530
l've had to beg a
lot of favours for you.

391
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:28,332
lf you let me down again...

392
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:31,606
l'll slit your throat.

393
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:34,469
Do you understand?

394
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:51,892
Did Sir shout at you?

395
00:34:55,366 --> 00:34:56,890
He always shouts at me.

396
00:34:58,703 --> 00:34:59,761
Or beats me.

397
00:35:18,856 --> 00:35:20,255
Be down in five minutes.

398
00:35:20,591 --> 00:35:21,649
Arjun.

399
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:36,271
l'll show you the sights
of Jamshedpur while we jog.

400
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:40,873
When we return, we will
race from there to here.

401
00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:42,870
But l don't want to race.

402
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,804
Has anyone asked you?

403
00:35:45,616 --> 00:35:46,674
Lets go.

404
00:35:56,694 --> 00:35:57,752
And you?

405
00:35:57,962 --> 00:35:59,691
l can't run.

406
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:01,355
Why?

407
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,737
Chotu.

408
00:36:44,942 --> 00:36:48,343

St. George's Church

425
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,498
Come on.

426
00:38:44,461 --> 00:38:45,519
Timing?

427
00:38:45,596 --> 00:38:46,995
Forty one minutes.

428
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:48,990
Good.

429
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:53,595
Disgraceful!

430
00:39:05,149 --> 00:39:07,014
Disgraceful!

431
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:12,606
Listen

432
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:15,009
Study well

433
00:40:15,152 --> 00:40:18,144
l shouldn't get any complaints.

434
00:40:18,222 --> 00:40:19,280
Okay Sir.

435
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:58,786
This is my son Rohan.

436
00:40:59,663 --> 00:41:02,860
He's been at Bishop Cotton School.

437
00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:06,195
He will be joining us from today...

438
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:13,867
Let's hope he'll
work as hard as we do.

439
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:17,010
And be a good co-worker.

440
00:41:19,683 --> 00:41:22,618
He is my son, but at home.
Not here.

441
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:28,614
lf anyone has a complaint
about him...

442
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:30,824
Please feel free to voice it.

443
00:41:31,628 --> 00:41:32,686
Understood?

444
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,891
Now get to your work.

445
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:36,630
Come Mr. Rao.

446
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:38,025
You too

447
00:41:38,902 --> 00:41:40,631
Mr. Rao is the manager here.

448
00:41:41,638 --> 00:41:43,230
He will brief you about your work.

449
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:45,767
He is older than you.

450
00:41:49,113 --> 00:41:50,171
Shall we?

451
00:41:50,981 --> 00:41:52,039
Just a moment...

452
00:41:58,122 --> 00:41:59,180
Best of luck.

453
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,925
An engineer always faces the task

454
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:19,332
Of describing shapes
of objects on paper.

455
00:43:19,736 --> 00:43:23,069
The paper, through which an
engineer conveys the details

456
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,941
Of a machine or object is
called Engineering Drawing.

457
00:43:28,278 --> 00:43:32,408
ln order to present the exact
size and shape of the object,

458
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:35,884
The lines are drawn perpendicular
to the planes of the paper

459
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:40,754
From various angles of the object,
giving an image on the paper.

460
00:43:40,824 --> 00:43:44,021
These are called
Orthographic projections.

461
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:46,761
ln the figure 10.1

462
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:51,290
All three sides,
that is front, side, top...

463
00:43:51,368 --> 00:43:52,960
Can be seen together.

464
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:56,305
When the projections are
parallel to one another...

465
00:43:56,373 --> 00:43:59,171
And also perpendicular
to the picture plane,

466
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:04,370
The projection thus forming a plane
is called Orthographic Projection.

467
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:08,308
When a surface, front, side or top...

468
00:44:08,785 --> 00:44:11,310
Of the object is to
be depicted separately

469
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:14,118
lt is drawn in the
true shape and proportion.

470
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:18,394
By assuming the object
placed in a particular position,

471
00:44:18,462 --> 00:44:22,193
Where only the surface
to be drawn is visible.

472
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:25,800
The projection is the representation
of the shape of an object.

473
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:28,861
On a plane or surface...

474
00:44:36,146 --> 00:44:38,205
Don't you know that
style is taxed in college?

475
00:44:38,415 --> 00:44:40,076
Now you know...

476
00:44:41,018 --> 00:44:42,212
Will you cut your hair now?

477
00:44:43,353 --> 00:44:44,820
What shall we do with him?

478
00:44:44,888 --> 00:44:45,946
Sit ups.

479
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:47,820
Fifty sit
- ups.

480
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:50,355
Go down. All the way.

481
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:51,485
Stand.

482
00:44:52,162 --> 00:44:53,891
Who's counting? My father?

483
00:44:53,964 --> 00:44:55,363
He asked you to sit, not shit.

484
00:44:55,832 --> 00:44:56,890
What are you laughing at?

485
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:27,390
You can't escape me now!

486
00:45:27,464 --> 00:45:29,193
l'm big, l'm small,

487
00:45:29,266 --> 00:45:31,860
l'm stronger, l have a gun.

488
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:33,926
How will you kill me?

489
00:46:18,248 --> 00:46:19,647
Put it on my account.

490
00:46:26,523 --> 00:46:28,252
Come on. Lay out the food.

491
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:55,176
Why don't we keep a cook?

492
00:46:56,486 --> 00:46:57,544
Will you pay?

493
00:47:00,557 --> 00:47:02,548
And a maid for Arjun...

494
00:47:02,626 --> 00:47:03,684
Yes, you can keep one.

495
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:06,028
When you earn, you can keep one.

496
00:47:07,297 --> 00:47:10,027
Maid, cook, whatever...

497
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:13,697
There's a recession on,

498
00:47:14,504 --> 00:47:16,597
Do you understand what that means?

499
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:20,576
Go. Call Arjun.

500
00:47:25,182 --> 00:47:27,377
Sir is calling you for dinner.

501
00:48:45,328 --> 00:48:46,386
He's coming.

502
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:42,769
Yes!

503
00:51:27,824 --> 00:51:28,882
Rum and coke.

504
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:48,709
l remember, l had chased him..

505
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,378
Do you know my name?

506
00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:00,647
No

507
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:02,516
Mishter Apu.

508
00:52:03,727 --> 00:52:04,785
Mister Apu.

509
00:52:04,861 --> 00:52:05,919
Mishter

510
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:07,387
Mister...

511
00:52:07,464 --> 00:52:11,332
Mishter..
- Mishter. - Appu. - Appu.

512
00:52:12,268 --> 00:52:13,997
We are your seniors,
you know that don't you?

513
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:16,897
Yes.

514
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:22,434
Then you also know that a
senior can do anything he likes.

515
00:52:24,614 --> 00:52:25,672
What shall we do with him?

516
00:52:26,616 --> 00:52:27,674
Sing a song?

517
00:52:27,751 --> 00:52:29,343
What the fuck fatso!

518
00:52:30,353 --> 00:52:32,412
You always make people sing.

519
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:34,722
He makes everyone sing.

520
00:52:35,759 --> 00:52:37,351
You want to make it to lndian ldol?

521
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,618
Why do you keep asking me?

522
00:52:38,695 --> 00:52:39,753
Ask him. He never says anything.

523
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:40,955
Okay. You.
What shall we do with him?

524
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:44,624

You're sitting so quietly,

No man, you sang well...

Why are you getting angry?

549
00:53:44,627 --> 00:53:46,492

Don't listen to fatso. He's mad.

lf he's mad he shouldn't be here.
- Calm down.

555
00:53:55,038 --> 00:53:57,563
Will you like it if l made

How can l live off him?
He wears shorts.

lf you let him,
he'll eat days of the year

603

He'll eat the food of
a starving man.

He'll eat Laloo's children

606
00:56:05,735 --> 00:56:07,566

He'll eat the fun of youth

608
00:56:09,572 --> 00:56:11,039

00:56:11,774 --> 00:56:14,709
He'll eat the walk of
a woman with no shame.

610
00:56:15,111 --> 00:56:16,578
And if given a chance...

611
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,706
He'll eat all your thoughts as well.

612
00:56:21,985 --> 00:56:25,512
Even a tortoise is faster,
Fatso master...

613
00:56:25,588 --> 00:56:29,046
He is a gas
- blaster, fatso master...

614
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:32,526
Fatso master is a total disaster...

615
00:56:32,595 --> 00:56:35,655
Total Disaster is Fatso master.

616
00:56:35,865 --> 00:56:39,164
Speaks from his ass, fatso master.

617
00:56:39,235 --> 00:56:42,204
Drinks only Fosters, Fatso master.

618
00:56:42,272 --> 00:56:45,901
Equals a hundred elephants,
Fatso master.

619
00:56:46,075 --> 00:56:49,533
Stomach or Equator? Fatso master.

620
00:56:49,612 --> 00:56:53,070
Larger than extra large,
Fatso master.

621

Original loo breaker,
Fatso master.

The Titanic's anchor,
Fatso master.

623
00:57:30,787 --> 00:57:31,913
Disgraceful.

car during the holidays.

641

No! Go to sleep.

653
01:02:40,963 --> 01:02:42,021
Lower your voice.

l had so many plans for you...

657
01:03:34,449 --> 01:03:37,941
To send you to England
to become a engineer...

658
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,488
But you've ruined everything.

659
01:03:43,491 --> 01:03:45,516
Which college will take you?

660
01:03:47,362 --> 01:03:49,592
Will any college take you?

661
01:03:50,165 --> 01:03:55,569
Will they?
- No!

662
01:03:57,105 --> 01:03:58,470
Can't even take a little pain eh?

663
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,098
Not even this much?

664
01:04:01,643 --> 01:04:02,701
ldiot.

665
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,275
You're not a boy. You're a girl.

666
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:15,715
You look like a girl too.

667
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,457
Just like your mother.

668
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:26,294
She loved you very much.

669
01:04:29,504 --> 01:04:30,630
More than me...

670
01:04:32,273 --> 01:04:33,331
Understood?

671
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,738
Get lost.

672
01:04:48,022 --> 01:04:50,081
l came to see you at school...

673
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:55,095
Met your principal too.

674
01:04:56,231 --> 01:04:58,699
You were playing football...

675
01:05:01,169 --> 01:05:03,535
You looked so happy,
l didn't want to disturb you...

676
01:05:06,574 --> 01:05:07,768
And besides...

677
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:11,770
l had nothing nice to say.

678
01:05:14,048 --> 01:05:15,743
ldiot girl!

679
01:05:16,618 --> 01:05:18,210
Haven't even had sex...

680
01:05:21,122 --> 01:05:22,180
Leave me alone!

681
01:05:24,392 --> 01:05:25,654
l'm okay now.

682
01:05:27,395 --> 01:05:28,453
Girl!

683
01:05:44,312 --> 01:05:45,370
What?

684
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,809
He was the original drunkard.

685
01:05:49,551 --> 01:05:52,349
Drunk all day long.

686
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:54,813
The first thing
he did every morning.

687
01:05:55,623 --> 01:05:59,582
Eat booze. Drink booze. Piss booze.

688
01:06:00,762 --> 01:06:04,095
Sold my mother's
wedding necklace for a drink

689
01:06:04,766 --> 01:06:07,826
He'd curse and beat
her when she protested.

690
01:06:09,237 --> 01:06:11,330
My sister and l could only watch.

691
01:06:13,174 --> 01:06:15,699
One day l came home and
he was beating her again.

692
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:18,110
My mother isn't a
bag of dirty laundry.

693
01:06:19,681 --> 01:06:20,841
l got pissed off...

694
01:06:21,449 --> 01:06:23,383
l became a hero and
caught him by the collar.

695
01:06:23,451 --> 01:06:26,852
'' Enough of your drama!'' l shouted.

696
01:06:27,855 --> 01:06:30,790
And threw him out of the house.

697
01:06:31,459 --> 01:06:33,586
Told him never to look back.

698
01:06:34,796 --> 01:06:39,199
Then l slammed the door shut
and turned towards my mother.

699
01:06:40,535 --> 01:06:42,196
Thought she would embrace me.

700
01:06:43,204 --> 01:06:44,603
But got a tight slap instead.

701
01:06:47,709 --> 01:06:52,305
Then she led that moron back in...

702
01:06:55,216 --> 01:06:59,744
And said, '' Whatever happens, he
is my husband and you're his son.''

703
01:07:03,424 --> 01:07:06,587
l became an orphan that day.

704
01:07:08,363 --> 01:07:09,421
Left home...

705
01:07:11,499 --> 01:07:12,898
But didn't leave Jamshedpur.

706
01:07:12,967 --> 01:07:14,229
My biggest mistake.

707
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,672
Fatso, before all this
heartache kills me, let's fight...

708
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,775
No man.
- Come on fatso.

No, Apu. Apu sit. Apu, don't go.

711
01:07:34,322 --> 01:07:37,758
Apu wait.
- Apu.

712
01:07:38,526 --> 01:07:40,926
Apu.. - l've been

713
01:07:41,863 --> 01:07:42,921
Who the hell is this?

714
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:46,459
This isn't carrom son. Go play Ludo.

715
01:07:47,702 --> 01:07:48,760
What's he doing?

716
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:52,933
Don't ask.

717
01:07:53,274 --> 01:07:54,332
This isn't carrom son.

718
01:07:54,542 --> 01:07:56,737
Really? ls it that funny?

719
01:07:56,878 --> 01:07:57,936
Shall l make you cry instead?

720
01:07:58,813 --> 01:08:00,337
What did you say? Make me cry?

721
01:08:00,415 --> 01:08:01,814
Yes. l'll make you cry.

722
01:08:02,684 --> 01:08:03,742
Where do you stay?

723
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:05,285
Wait, wait...

724
01:08:05,353 --> 01:08:06,411

725
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:07,812
You'll make me cry?
- Yes.

726
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:09,254
Do you know who l am?
- Who are you?

727
01:08:09,324 --> 01:08:11,224
Don't you recognize me?
- Who are you?

728
01:08:11,292 --> 01:08:13,226
Don't you recognize me?
- Who are you?

729
01:08:13,294 --> 01:08:16,559
Are you new here?
- Are you?

730
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:18,292
Why are you wasting your
time with this mad man?

731
01:08:18,366 --> 01:08:19,526
See how he's talking to me!

732
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,658
Who are you?

01:08:20,735 --> 01:08:21,963

01:08:22,036 --> 01:08:23,298

Let's get out.

746
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:31,896
Come on Shiv...

747
01:09:44,385 --> 01:09:45,647
Run Fatso

748
01:09:52,727 --> 01:09:53,853
Open the door. Quick.

749
01:09:57,665 --> 01:09:58,996
Open the door.

750
01:10:00,401 --> 01:10:02,460
Quick. Open, open, open...

751
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,547
Get lost! Blow me
you fuckers! Get lost!

752
01:10:27,428 --> 01:10:28,486
What did you tell him?

753
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:30,931
l said, '' Look son...

754
01:10:31,499 --> 01:10:33,831
Play pool with me
instead of with these fools.

755
01:10:34,435 --> 01:10:37,097
l can pot the ball without a stick.''

756
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,598
You're lying.

757
01:10:40,675 --> 01:10:41,733
No l swear.

758
01:10:41,809 --> 01:10:43,037
Then he told me to get lost...

759
01:10:43,644 --> 01:10:47,444
So l said, ''This is why
you're here putting balls in...

760
01:10:47,515 --> 01:10:49,949
And your wife does the
same at home with other men.''

761
01:10:51,486 --> 01:10:53,977
You never said that...
- He's lying...

762
01:10:54,055 --> 01:10:55,420
l really did say it

763
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:59,121
Then he kept staring at me.
So l said, ''What are you looking at?

764
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:03,863
Want to see your wife's tattoo?
lt's across both cheeks of my ass.''

765
01:11:05,066 --> 01:11:06,124
You said that?

766
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,465
Balls you said that. Fuck off.

767
01:11:10,004 --> 01:11:11,062
l really did!

768
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:13,406
But it was fun...

769
01:11:14,742 --> 01:11:18,940
Fatso doesn't believe me, eh?

770
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:22,608
Apu Don't. Stop it.

771
01:11:26,087 --> 01:11:27,418
Hey it's raining.
- Rain!

772
01:11:27,488 --> 01:11:32,152
Filled with the joy of life,

773
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:41,833
Bursting with delight.

774
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:47,434
We never asked for this moment...

775
01:11:47,508 --> 01:11:49,499
We stole it.

776
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:53,777
This is how we will live...

777
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:38,750
lf we had run faster we
wouldn't have been expelled.

778
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:40,885
Rohan?

779
01:12:40,962 --> 01:12:42,020
No, it's the Moustache.

780
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:43,654
Look behind you. l'm
standing there with my moped.

781
01:12:44,165 --> 01:12:46,224
Rohan, how are you?

782
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:47,892
Manu...

783
01:12:48,903 --> 01:12:49,961
How are you?

784
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:52,062
l'm good.
Why are you awake this late?

785
01:12:52,573 --> 01:12:53,904
Jamshedpur has a new disco?

786
01:12:53,975 --> 01:12:58,241
No man. l sneaked out to
drink with some friends.

787
01:12:58,579 --> 01:13:00,240
Grown up already?

788
01:13:00,681 --> 01:13:03,172
Oh shut up.
We got into a fight as well.

789
01:13:03,718 --> 01:13:06,585
Beat up two guys. Had a blast.

790
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:08,179
You're mad...

791
01:13:08,589 --> 01:13:09,681
Totally mad

792
01:13:10,591 --> 01:13:11,649
You okay?

793
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:12,784
Totally fine.

794
01:13:12,927 --> 01:13:14,588
How's your father?

795
01:13:14,662 --> 01:13:16,823
Not father. Call him 'Sir'.

796
01:13:17,598 --> 01:13:21,159
Makes me work at his
factory and study engineering...

797
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:23,135
Says l should study.
There's a recession on...

798
01:13:23,604 --> 01:13:24,662
Do you know what recession means?

799
01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:26,766
l don't know what it means.

800
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:32,608
Even if l fail all my
exams he can't do anything

801
01:13:33,147 --> 01:13:34,205
He can't do shit...

802
01:13:35,116 --> 01:13:38,984
l also have a younger half
- brother.

803
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:42,685
A six-year-old brother who
l didn't even know existed.

804
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:45,283
Are you okay?

805
01:13:45,626 --> 01:13:49,153
l'm fine. l really am.
Meet the new town drunk.

806
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:52,599
Enough about me.
How are Vikram and Benoy?

807
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:54,225
Everyone is fine...

808
01:13:54,902 --> 01:13:58,303
Vikram's Dad has a new restaurant.
Vikram is working there.

809
01:13:58,906 --> 01:14:02,205
Benoy's in art school.
He's changed completely.

810
01:14:02,643 --> 01:14:06,875
Wears a kurta, quotes Tagore,
shows a new girl his room everyday.

811
01:14:07,248 --> 01:14:08,306
Why? ls it a special room?

812
01:14:08,582 --> 01:14:10,072
Yes... it has a bed...

813
01:14:15,256 --> 01:14:16,314
And you?

814
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:18,187
l'm fine. Looking for work.

815
01:14:18,793 --> 01:14:21,125
Dad still ignores me
and reads his news...

816
01:14:21,662 --> 01:14:26,895
And mom sulks as if dad caught her
watching the Kanti Shah's ''Grapes''.

817
01:14:29,203 --> 01:14:30,670
Are you happy?
- l am...

818
01:14:32,673 --> 01:14:33,799
And you?
- Me too...

819
01:14:34,275 --> 01:14:35,333
You sure?

820
01:14:36,277 --> 01:14:37,335
l'm sure...

821
01:14:38,679 --> 01:14:40,078
l miss you guys a lot.

822
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:42,206
Come to Bombay.
Tell your father..

823
01:14:42,283 --> 01:14:45,684
..we'll take care of everything.
Even you'll have fun.

824
01:14:46,187 --> 01:14:48,018
l will come. For sure.

825
01:14:48,823 --> 01:14:52,224
Listen, l don't have much money,
l'll call you some other time.

826
01:14:52,693 --> 01:14:55,628
Tell Vikram and Benoy
that l said hi.

827
01:14:55,763 --> 01:14:57,697
l will... and you take care...

828
01:14:57,765 --> 01:14:58,823
l will.

829
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:00,628
And keep calling...

830
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:01,929
l will... bye...

831
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:16,182
Ok. Bye

832
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:16,436
Bhairav Singh

833
01:16:17,845 --> 01:16:19,335
l am coming to get you...

834
01:16:21,715 --> 01:16:23,774
Do you understand recession?

835
01:16:24,318 --> 01:16:25,785
Disgraceful.

836
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:57,477
Was this picnic your idea?

837
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:01,344
Your father isn't as bad
as you make him out to be.

838
01:17:02,223 --> 01:17:06,057
l just don't get him.
Sometimes a demon, sometimes a lamb.

839
01:17:07,828 --> 01:17:10,023
Spoken like a true writer...

840
01:17:11,098 --> 01:17:12,360
l'm not talking like a writer...

841
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:16,433
Your mother would have been
proud if she were alive today.

842
01:17:16,971 --> 01:17:18,836
She always wanted you
to be a writer.

843
01:17:19,173 --> 01:17:20,367
Really?
- Yes.

844
01:17:21,442 --> 01:17:24,900
She never told your
father but she told me...

845
01:17:25,846 --> 01:17:30,783
How she would've loved that line...
Sometimes a demon, sometimes a lamb.

846
01:17:33,454 --> 01:17:38,118
Sometimes a demon,
sometimes a lamb.

847
01:17:38,192 --> 01:17:40,854
Stop it!

848
01:17:50,004 --> 01:17:53,405
l have an idea...

849
01:17:53,474 --> 01:17:55,465
What is it?

850
01:17:57,978 --> 01:17:59,309
Let's hear one of Rohan's poems...

851
01:18:04,151 --> 01:18:06,016
He's written a full-length novel...

852
01:18:07,488 --> 01:18:10,548
l'm not asking you to
change your mind ...

853
01:18:11,158 --> 01:18:14,491
Listen to it. lf you
don't like it, don't applaud.

854
01:18:18,032 --> 01:18:20,159
Come on big man, go for it.

855
01:18:24,505 --> 01:18:29,499
lf you could see past the shore,
You would know what l think.

856
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:35,177
lf you could hear the waves,
You would know what l think.

857
01:18:36,317 --> 01:18:41,118
Remove your veil of obstinacy,
And look beyond the window.

858
01:18:42,056 --> 01:18:46,584
lf you could see through convention,
You would know what l think.

859
01:18:47,861 --> 01:18:52,889
lf you had faith in yourself as l do,
You could walk with me a while...

860
01:18:53,934 --> 01:18:58,428
lf you could see the colors l do,
You could walk with me a while.

861
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:01,873
lf you want to touch the sky as l do,

862
01:19:01,942 --> 01:19:04,172
Then your desires would come alive.

863
01:19:04,945 --> 01:19:09,609
Then, in my next life, we
could fly together a while.

864
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:18,482
Forget it

865
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:20,892
A woman's magazine will publish it...

866
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:23,259
...or someone will drop a
coin in your begging bowl.

867
01:20:11,879 --> 01:20:12,937
Hello.

868
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:17,041
Please... sit...

869
01:20:17,684 --> 01:20:18,742
Hello

870
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:19,877
How are you?
- Please, have a seat.

871
01:20:19,953 --> 01:20:21,011
How was the journey?

872
01:20:21,355 --> 01:20:23,323
Okay. Our flight got a bit delayed.

873
01:20:24,892 --> 01:20:26,416
l made these for you to read.

874
01:20:50,384 --> 01:20:55,117
They're good...

875
01:20:56,323 --> 01:20:58,018
l'm glad you came today.

876
01:20:59,059 --> 01:21:00,390
l'm off to Kolkata tomorrow...

877
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:03,455
Let me show you the workshop.

878
01:21:04,264 --> 01:21:05,322
Sure.

879
01:21:10,871 --> 01:21:11,929
Hello?

880
01:21:12,005 --> 01:21:13,472
ls that Mr. Singh?
- Yes?

881
01:21:13,807 --> 01:21:17,174
l'm Mrs Batra here,
Principal of Arjun's school.

882
01:21:17,244 --> 01:21:18,802
Yes Mrs Batra, tell me.

883
01:21:18,879 --> 01:21:22,007
There's been another problem with
your son, Arjun, this morning...

884
01:21:22,816 --> 01:21:25,785
We'd like you to come here
and take him back home today.

885
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:30,012
l'm in a meeting right now.
Can l come post lunch?

886
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:33,088
No Mr. Singh. This is an
extremely serious problem.

887
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,252
l know Mrs. Batra but...

888
01:21:35,362 --> 01:21:37,125
Keep him in your office for sometime.

889
01:21:37,197 --> 01:21:38,755
Mr. Singh please understand

890
01:21:38,832 --> 01:21:41,096
l cannot allow Arjun to
remain in school today.

891
01:21:42,102 --> 01:21:44,366
Okay, l'm coming.

892
01:21:44,438 --> 01:21:45,496
ln half an hour?

893
01:21:45,572 --> 01:21:46,903
Yes Mrs. Batra. l'm coming right now.

894
01:21:46,974 --> 01:21:48,032
Thank you, Mr. Singh.

895
01:21:51,378 --> 01:21:55,508
l'm sorry, but l have to
rush to my son's school.

896
01:21:55,849 --> 01:21:59,182
He's been unwell
recently and it got worse today.

897
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:03,121
But Mr. Rao will show
you around the workshop.

898
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:05,852
No problem. We'll come back tomorrow.

899
01:22:05,926 --> 01:22:08,190
We have other factories to see today.

900
01:22:08,328 --> 01:22:12,025
But l told you, l have to be in
Kolkata tomorrow. l've committed it.

901
01:22:12,466 --> 01:22:14,525
l am sorry. We can't stay any longer.

902
01:22:15,402 --> 01:22:18,428
Anyway. We'll meet again.
Some other time?

903
01:22:19,139 --> 01:22:20,197
Okay...

904
01:22:20,407 --> 01:22:21,465
Let's go.

905
01:22:51,905 --> 01:22:52,963
What happened?

906
01:22:53,173 --> 01:22:54,231
Get in the car.

907
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:14,451
What happened?

908
01:23:15,862 --> 01:23:17,022
His blood pressure is very low.

909
01:23:17,531 --> 01:23:19,431
Seems like he's had a bad fall.

910
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,497
There could be internal bleeding.

911
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:25,237
l'll have to check. We'll keep him
under observation for a few days.

912
01:23:25,305 --> 01:23:26,363
How many days?

913
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:27,998
Four to five days.

914
01:23:28,075 --> 01:23:29,133
Four to five days?

915
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:32,235
Don't worry. He'll
be fine. Don't worry.

916
01:23:33,146 --> 01:23:34,204
Thank you.

917
01:23:37,884 --> 01:23:38,942
How did it happen?

918
01:23:39,486 --> 01:23:40,544
Fell down the stairs.

919
01:23:41,955 --> 01:23:43,013
How?

920
01:23:43,423 --> 01:23:45,948
How should l know? He just fell.

921
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:51,629
You go home. l'll stay here.

922
01:23:52,966 --> 01:23:54,024
l'm also staying.

923
01:23:58,572 --> 01:23:59,630
What happened to your results?

924
01:24:00,907 --> 01:24:02,636
l passed.
- Marks?

925
01:24:03,977 --> 01:24:06,036
They're good.
- Good.

926
01:24:14,521 --> 01:24:16,113
l'm going to Kolkata for three days.

927
01:24:18,258 --> 01:24:21,159
lf all goes well, l'll
return with a few contracts.

928
01:24:22,262 --> 01:24:24,162
You stay here with Arjun.

929
01:24:24,464 --> 01:24:26,989
And don't leave him alone, okay?

930
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:28,125
Yes Sir.

931
01:24:33,473 --> 01:24:34,531
And...

932
01:24:35,075 --> 01:24:37,134
No need to inform Uncle and Auntie.

933
01:24:38,278 --> 01:24:41,679
l've told them that both of
you are going with me. Okay?

934
01:24:42,015 --> 01:24:43,073
Yes Sir.

935
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:46,477
Fine.

936
01:24:56,296 --> 01:24:57,354
Have you eaten?

937
01:25:04,638 --> 01:25:06,037
Sir has gone to kolkata.

938
01:25:08,575 --> 01:25:09,633
Aren't you happy?

939
01:25:18,185 --> 01:25:19,243
What happened yesterday?

940
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:49,339
For you.

941
01:25:57,023 --> 01:25:58,081
And these...

942
01:25:58,158 --> 01:25:59,750
lf you feel like reading.

943
01:26:08,235 --> 01:26:10,635
This has my poems and stories.

944
01:26:11,304 --> 01:26:12,362
Would you like to hear some?

945
01:26:16,643 --> 01:26:17,701
Hello Arjun.

946
01:26:19,446 --> 01:26:20,572
Are you feeling well today?

947
01:26:21,281 --> 01:26:22,339
Good.

948
01:26:28,321 --> 01:26:29,583
Could you change his clothes?

949
01:26:29,656 --> 01:26:31,123
Yes.
- Thank you.

950
01:26:35,662 --> 01:26:36,720
What is it?

951
01:27:06,092 --> 01:27:07,150
What now?

952
01:28:06,152 --> 01:28:11,146
Lunch was to be served by 12.30.
lts 1 :00 p.m now.

953
01:28:11,224 --> 01:28:13,158
Please don't shout. lt's bad for you.

954
01:28:13,226 --> 01:28:14,454
Yes l know.

955
01:28:14,761 --> 01:28:16,160
l can get a heart attack.

956
01:28:16,229 --> 01:28:18,322
But if l die of hunger before that?

957
01:28:18,398 --> 01:28:20,457
l'll go and get your food just now.

958
01:28:20,901 --> 01:28:22,163
Get it fast...

959
01:28:22,702 --> 01:28:24,897
Corpses don't eat.

960
01:28:29,776 --> 01:28:30,902
Why don't you laugh?

961
01:28:32,379 --> 01:28:33,505
l am 80 years old...

962
01:28:34,514 --> 01:28:35,913
Grandfather of six.

963
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:37,713
Great grandfather of two...

964
01:28:38,184 --> 01:28:39,242
Can't l shout?

965
01:28:40,186 --> 01:28:41,244
Laugh.

966
01:28:42,188 --> 01:28:43,246
Laugh.

967
01:28:58,638 --> 01:28:59,696
Would you like to listen to a poem?

968
01:29:10,817 --> 01:29:11,875
Chandu's Cycle.

969
01:29:12,752 --> 01:29:15,220
Chandu's cycle was
just like Chandu...

970
01:29:15,822 --> 01:29:18,689
As it moved, it crickered and
crankered, just like Chandu.

971
01:29:19,559 --> 01:29:22,619
The handle was as light
as Chandu's slender hand.

972
01:29:23,229 --> 01:29:26,255
The pedals were as thin
as Chandu's spindle legs.

973
01:29:27,233 --> 01:29:30,225
The seat was as broad
as Chandu's huge behind.

974
01:29:30,971 --> 01:29:34,236
The carrier was as small
as Chandu's short career.

975
01:29:34,774 --> 01:29:36,366
Yet it was Chandu's true friend.

976
01:29:36,843 --> 01:29:38,276
Was always loyal to Chandu.

977
01:29:39,245 --> 01:29:42,772
lt took Chandu's
heavy weight with ease.

978
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:46,786
One day the cycle broke down.

979
01:29:47,253 --> 01:29:49,244
Seeing a bull charging at him,

980
01:29:49,356 --> 01:29:50,687
Chandu dropped it hard.

981
01:29:51,257 --> 01:29:54,249
When Monty Mechanic
could not save the cycle,

982
01:29:54,928 --> 01:29:58,261
Chandu's father sold
it to a scrap dealer.

983
01:29:58,732 --> 01:30:02,259
Chandu drowned himself in his books.

984
01:30:02,402 --> 01:30:05,371
Like he had an old dream to fulfill.

985
01:30:06,006 --> 01:30:07,405
Later, when Chandu grew up,

986
01:30:07,807 --> 01:30:09,274
He used his very first salary...

987
01:30:09,676 --> 01:30:13,271
And got himself a new cycle...

988
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,338
But...

989
01:30:15,515 --> 01:30:16,573
But?

990
01:30:16,816 --> 01:30:20,274
This cycle too was
just like Chandu...

991
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:23,282
lt still crickered and
crankered as it moved around.

992
01:30:23,823 --> 01:30:25,290
lt's seat was...

993
01:30:25,358 --> 01:30:27,417
As broad as Chandu's huge behind.

994
01:30:27,627 --> 01:30:29,288
The carrier was as small...

995
01:30:29,362 --> 01:30:31,296
As Chandu's short career.

996
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,358
You wrote that?

997
01:30:36,536 --> 01:30:38,299
Yes
- Wow...

998
01:30:38,972 --> 01:30:40,030
Very good.

999
01:30:40,907 --> 01:30:42,306
Very inspiring !

1000
01:30:42,542 --> 01:30:44,976
Thank you.
- Keep writing like this, son.

1001
01:30:45,712 --> 01:30:47,043
Keep writing.

1002
01:30:48,381 --> 01:30:50,975
Write.

1003
01:30:59,926 --> 01:31:02,918
How many friends do
you have in school?

1004
01:31:06,332 --> 01:31:07,390
Seven.

1005
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:08,525
Their names?

1006
01:31:08,735 --> 01:31:09,793
Apurva,

1007
01:31:10,336 --> 01:31:11,735
Sunny, Raju,

1008
01:31:11,805 --> 01:31:13,329
Batuk, Kunal...

1009
01:31:13,573 --> 01:31:15,507
Kunal...Kunal,

1010
01:31:15,575 --> 01:31:16,633
Veer.

1011
01:31:17,343 --> 01:31:18,401
And?

1012
01:31:18,611 --> 01:31:19,669
And...

1013
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,938
That's only six.

1014
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:25,544
And one more...

1015
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:27,878
Tushar.

1016
01:31:28,354 --> 01:31:29,685
You have so many friends.

1017
01:31:30,356 --> 01:31:31,550
l have only three.

1018
01:31:32,892 --> 01:31:34,416
What was your mother like?

1019
01:31:35,361 --> 01:31:37,727
My mother was very nice.

1020
01:31:38,965 --> 01:31:40,432
She loved me a lot.

1021
01:31:41,367 --> 01:31:42,595
She smelled wonderful

1022
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:44,364
when l'd cuddle up to sleep.

1023
01:31:45,038 --> 01:31:46,369
Just like a mother.

1024
01:31:48,475 --> 01:31:50,443
l don't know what
my mother was like.

1025
01:31:51,044 --> 01:31:52,375
Do you know her?

1026
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:55,038
No.

1027
01:32:02,722 --> 01:32:03,780
Mr Poet...

1028
01:32:06,392 --> 01:32:07,620
Why don't you ever laugh?

1029
01:32:08,995 --> 01:32:10,053
Yes.

1030
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:12,394
Look at you now. You look so good.

1031
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,399
When do we hear something new?

1032
01:32:15,702 --> 01:32:16,760
Tonight?

1033
01:32:16,936 --> 01:32:17,994
ln the night?

1034
01:32:18,738 --> 01:32:20,000
Do you also write at night?

1035
01:32:20,406 --> 01:32:21,464
Sometimes.

1036
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:22,667
Beware of the night ...

1037
01:32:23,476 --> 01:32:24,534
You see ...

1038
01:32:24,878 --> 01:32:26,402
The day destroys the night,

1039
01:32:26,746 --> 01:32:28,008
Night divides the day.

1040
01:32:28,581 --> 01:32:29,639
Try to run,

1041
01:32:29,949 --> 01:32:31,007
Try to hide...

1042
01:32:31,151 --> 01:32:32,550
Break on through to the other side.

1043
01:32:35,488 --> 01:32:38,423
This is the true
story of three friends...

1044
01:32:38,691 --> 01:32:41,421
Muninder, Benoy and Rohit.

1045
01:32:41,795 --> 01:32:45,424
The kingdom where
they lived would select

1046
01:32:45,498 --> 01:32:47,432
the smartest boys for training.

1047
01:32:47,767 --> 01:32:52,033
Years later, they would join
the King's prestigious army.

1048
01:32:52,705 --> 01:32:56,436
But nobody really knew what
went on inside the castle.

1049
01:32:56,976 --> 01:33:00,434
Their parents didn't know
that the King's evil minister,

1050
01:33:00,513 --> 01:33:03,880
Was brain-washing the kids
and turning them into robots.

1051
01:33:04,184 --> 01:33:05,446
ls it a true story?

1052
01:33:05,518 --> 01:33:06,576
Yes.

1053
01:33:06,653 --> 01:33:09,451
The wicked man's name was Rathod.

1054
01:33:09,522 --> 01:33:10,580
Rathod!

1055
01:33:10,657 --> 01:33:11,851
Yes, Rathod.

1056
01:34:16,055 --> 01:34:18,148
Vikreet and Benoy were
with the full Robot Army...

1057
01:34:18,524 --> 01:34:20,515
Muninder and the kids
were due any minute now...

1058
01:34:20,827 --> 01:34:23,819
Rohit was worried.
They hadn't come yet.

1059
01:34:24,264 --> 01:34:28,530
He turned around. And froze.
A terrified look came into his eyes.

1060
01:34:29,202 --> 01:34:31,193
He saw someone
coming through the tunnel.

1061
01:34:31,871 --> 01:34:33,668
Someone was coming from the tunnel...

1062
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:34,866
Who was coming?

1063
01:34:38,778 --> 01:34:40,211
Who was it?

1064
01:34:46,152 --> 01:34:48,177
We'll finish tomorrow...
- Now!

1065
01:34:54,894 --> 01:34:56,020
34 in Chemistry

1066
01:34:57,563 --> 01:34:59,690
20 in Physics. 15 in Maths.

1067
01:35:01,034 --> 01:35:02,558
You told me you passed.

1068
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:08,231
ls this a joke to you?

1069
01:35:09,642 --> 01:35:12,577
l thought you'd finally
become serious about your studies.

1070
01:35:12,645 --> 01:35:17,105
You're narrating
stories to half-dead people.

1071
01:35:17,183 --> 01:35:18,582
Just to hear them tell you
what a good writer you are.

1072
01:35:20,586 --> 01:35:21,644
What are you staring at?

1073
01:35:22,588 --> 01:35:23,646
Lower your eyes.

1074
01:35:24,991 --> 01:35:27,255
lf this wasn't a hospital,
l would skin you right now.

1075
01:35:28,594 --> 01:35:31,586
l'm not going to
forget this in a hurry.

1076
01:35:32,899 --> 01:35:36,835
Come home. l'll make
sure l get an answer.

1077
01:35:44,277 --> 01:35:45,608
What did Sir say?

1078
01:35:45,745 --> 01:35:48,612
Sir said that he will send
me to the hospital as well.

1079
01:35:48,748 --> 01:35:49,806
Why?

1080
01:35:50,683 --> 01:35:51,809
Because l failed my exams.

1081
01:35:53,319 --> 01:35:55,617
So you'll go back to
boarding school?

1082
01:35:56,155 --> 01:35:57,213
No. Why?

1083
01:35:57,290 --> 01:36:01,920
Sir said if l don't pass,
he'll send me to a boarding school.

1084
01:37:19,705 --> 01:37:21,036
What happened that day?

1085
01:37:22,375 --> 01:37:23,706
Sir hit me.

1086
01:37:25,711 --> 01:37:26,769
Why?

1087
01:37:26,846 --> 01:37:31,306
Two boys were teasing me at school.
l broke one's teeth.

1088
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:34,777
Did he beat you a lot?

1089
01:37:34,854 --> 01:37:36,719
He beat me with a belt.

1090
01:38:32,245 --> 01:38:33,303
Shall we go?

1091
01:38:48,461 --> 01:38:49,792
How old are you?

1092
01:38:57,970 --> 01:38:59,494
l'm asking you something.

1093
01:39:00,406 --> 01:39:01,464
How old are you?

1094
01:39:03,809 --> 01:39:04,867
Seventeen.

1095
01:39:05,811 --> 01:39:06,869
Seventeen...

1096
01:39:08,114 --> 01:39:09,411
And you still don't use your brain.

1097
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:13,815
When will you start?
After you turn forty?

1098
01:39:19,825 --> 01:39:20,883
Why did you fail?

1099
01:39:22,495 --> 01:39:23,553
l didn't study.

1100
01:39:23,829 --> 01:39:24,887
Why not?

1101
01:39:25,131 --> 01:39:26,894
l don't understand engineering.

1102
01:39:27,366 --> 01:39:29,231
You didn't try hard enough.

1103
01:39:29,835 --> 01:39:30,893
l did.
- Shut up!

1104
01:39:32,471 --> 01:39:33,529
Bloody failure.

1105
01:39:40,346 --> 01:39:42,143
lf you weren't studying,
what were you doing?

1106
01:39:43,849 --> 01:39:44,941
l'd sit by the river.

1107
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:47,377
What did you do there?

1108
01:39:52,024 --> 01:39:54,584
What did you do there?
Smoke cigarettes?

1109
01:39:57,163 --> 01:39:58,221
Yes

1110
01:40:00,032 --> 01:40:01,090
When did you start smoking?

1111
01:40:01,867 --> 01:40:02,925
ln school.

1112
01:40:04,036 --> 01:40:06,504
So why did you lie earlier?

1113
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:22,478
Light it.

1114
01:40:26,892 --> 01:40:28,883
l'm not joking. Light it.

1115
01:40:54,453 --> 01:40:55,511
Smoke it....

1116
01:41:46,505 --> 01:41:48,166
What other lies have you told me?

1117
01:41:53,045 --> 01:41:57,505
Lying is a weakness. lt's cowardice.

1118
01:41:59,719 --> 01:42:02,517
A liar is a spineless person.

1119
01:42:04,056 --> 01:42:07,389
Who doesn't have the balls to
say what he really believes.

1120
01:42:09,128 --> 01:42:10,527
You're a coward.

1121
01:42:11,731 --> 01:42:13,460
Do you have the
balls to hear the truth?

1122
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:15,462
l ask the questions here.

1123
01:42:15,601 --> 01:42:18,536
l said l want to be a writer.
Did you listen?

1124
01:42:18,738 --> 01:42:22,196
You know that l'm a good writer.
Everyone likes my writing...

1125
01:42:22,274 --> 01:42:26,210
l don't. And l will
not discuss it anymore.

1126
01:42:26,612 --> 01:42:29,012
How often have you lied to me?

1127
01:42:29,081 --> 01:42:30,412
Every time you
couldn't digest the truth

1128
01:42:30,483 --> 01:42:32,747
And where is your spine?

1129
01:42:33,018 --> 01:42:36,010
You lied as well. You said
that Arjun fell down the stairs.

1130
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,755
He didn't fall down the stairs.

1131
01:42:38,224 --> 01:42:40,089
l know that you beat
him with your belt.

1132
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,286
l lost a contract
worth a lot because of him.

1133
01:42:42,561 --> 01:42:45,621
He should understand
the consequences.

1134
01:42:45,765 --> 01:42:47,289
By hitting him?
- lt was a mistake.

1135
01:42:47,366 --> 01:42:48,424
By sending him to hospital?

1136
01:42:48,501 --> 01:42:51,766
l didn't want to send him to the
hospital. l said it was a mistake.

1137
01:42:51,837 --> 01:42:54,635
l didn't want to hit him.
l apologized to him.

1138
01:42:54,707 --> 01:42:59,371
Well done Sir. Scar the child
for life, scare him to death...

1139
01:42:59,712 --> 01:43:02,647
and then apologise. Your
father would have been proud.

1140
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:09,043
l said it happened by mistake,
l didn't want to hit him...

1141
01:43:09,655 --> 01:43:10,713
Did l tell you?

1142
01:43:12,458 --> 01:43:13,516
Sir?

1143
01:43:13,659 --> 01:43:14,717
What?

1144
01:43:15,127 --> 01:43:16,719
Won't you apologise to me now?

1145
01:43:17,062 --> 01:43:18,120
You!

1146
01:44:35,608 --> 01:44:36,666
Good morning.

1147
01:44:37,743 --> 01:44:38,801
Good morning, Sir.

1148
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,142
Arjun get up.

1149
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:45,616
l know you're awake.

1150
01:44:47,219 --> 01:44:48,277
Get up.

1151
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,151
l'm here to apologize...

1152
01:44:58,831 --> 01:44:59,889
Forgive me.

1153
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:04,162
There's too much work and
then there's the two of you.

1154
01:45:05,838 --> 01:45:07,237
l get frustrated.

1155
01:45:08,841 --> 01:45:10,706
l get angry, and then...

1156
01:45:14,713 --> 01:45:16,180
l thought a lot last night.

1157
01:45:19,652 --> 01:45:21,517
l have done a lot for both of you.

1158
01:45:23,255 --> 01:45:26,190
But it was never enough.

1159
01:45:27,259 --> 01:45:28,521
And it never will be.

1160
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:34,397
Rohan, you don't want to study

1161
01:45:35,267 --> 01:45:38,202
So there's no need to
study any more.

1162
01:45:39,605 --> 01:45:42,802
You start work full
time at the factory today.

1163
01:45:43,809 --> 01:45:46,209
You will reach one hour
earlier than the others...

1164
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:51,272
And you leave two hours
after they leave. Okay?

1165
01:45:53,285 --> 01:45:54,343
Arjun

1166
01:45:55,287 --> 01:45:56,811
l have spoken to the principal.

1167
01:45:57,957 --> 01:45:59,948
A new semester starts in two weeks.

1168
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:04,555
You're going to boarding school.
To study and live there.

1169
01:46:06,498 --> 01:46:07,556
Okay?

1170
01:46:14,907 --> 01:46:17,967
l've decided to marry again.
For myself.

1171
01:46:20,312 --> 01:46:21,574
l get very lonely.

1172
01:46:22,982 --> 01:46:26,383
And now that both of you won't
be here, it will get worse...

1173
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,578
Okay?

1174
01:46:37,997 --> 01:46:39,259
Okay.

1175
01:46:46,672 --> 01:46:47,798
You're getting married?

1176
01:46:48,674 --> 01:46:49,732
Yes.

1177
01:46:50,876 --> 01:46:51,934
To whom?

1178
01:46:52,611 --> 01:46:53,669
Somebody.

1179
01:46:54,279 --> 01:46:55,871
And Rohan? Arjun?

1180
01:46:56,415 --> 01:47:01,614
They're insolent.
l will always be their enemy.

1181
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:04,015
But they're your children.

1182
01:47:04,289 --> 01:47:05,756
You're sending Arjun
to boarding school?

1183
01:47:05,824 --> 01:47:06,882
He's six years old...

1184
01:47:06,959 --> 01:47:09,291
l was six when dad sent me...

1185
01:47:09,695 --> 01:47:11,560
But Arjun isn't like you.

1186
01:47:12,031 --> 01:47:14,761
Then he'll become like me.
Forget all this...

1187
01:47:15,434 --> 01:47:17,629
You want a drink?

1188
01:47:18,303 --> 01:47:19,361
No.

1189
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:27,304
Please think
about what you're doing.

1190
01:47:27,513 --> 01:47:28,844
l have thought about it...

1191
01:47:29,982 --> 01:47:31,506
l took this decision after thinking.

1192
01:47:34,053 --> 01:47:37,989
lf it's too much for you
we can take care of Arjun.

1193
01:47:42,061 --> 01:47:43,323
What did you say?

1194
01:47:48,467 --> 01:47:49,525
What do you mean 'too much'?

1195
01:47:49,935 --> 01:47:51,334
l mean...

1196
01:47:51,403 --> 01:47:53,530
What do you mean by 'too much'?

1197
01:47:54,073 --> 01:47:57,736
We can bring him up.
Take care of him. Send him to school.

1198
01:47:58,010 --> 01:47:59,739
We have no children...
- Arjun is my son.

1199
01:48:00,412 --> 01:48:02,346
And l'm not in the
business of selling children.

1200
01:48:02,414 --> 01:48:03,745
Why take this the wrong way?

1201
01:48:03,816 --> 01:48:06,683
All l'm saying if it's too hard...
- What are you saying?

1202
01:48:06,752 --> 01:48:09,346
lt isn't my fault that
you didn't have children.

1203
01:48:09,421 --> 01:48:12,754
Adopting Arjun won't cure
your infertility will it?

1204
01:48:13,425 --> 01:48:14,687
That's not fair

1205
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:15,818
Not fair?

1206
01:48:16,829 --> 01:48:18,091
You want to tell me what's fair?

1207
01:48:20,099 --> 01:48:21,430
Get lost...

1208
01:48:24,703 --> 01:48:26,432
What is your problem?

1209
01:48:28,373 --> 01:48:30,705
Why can't you ever see anyone happy?

1210
01:48:30,776 --> 01:48:31,834
l'm tired.

1211
01:48:32,511 --> 01:48:34,376
l'm tired of making everyone happy.

1212
01:48:34,446 --> 01:48:36,971
First Father, then you.
Now these two. l can't take it.

1213
01:48:37,049 --> 01:48:39,916
Have you ever given him one chance?
- One chance?

1214
01:48:40,652 --> 01:48:43,587
l put everything into his education.
He got kicked out.

1215
01:48:43,655 --> 01:48:46,385
l begged for his admission
into College. He failed.

1216
01:48:46,458 --> 01:48:47,516
What else has he ever done?

1217
01:48:47,593 --> 01:48:49,993
He's written a novel.
- He's written shit!

1218
01:48:50,596 --> 01:48:52,120
Stop encouraging him.

1219
01:48:52,798 --> 01:48:55,858
Stop living your
unfulfilled dreams through my son.

1220
01:48:56,802 --> 01:48:58,463
l don't want him to become like you.

1221
01:48:58,871 --> 01:48:59,929
Like me?

1222
01:49:00,072 --> 01:49:02,404
Look at yourself...

1223
01:49:03,142 --> 01:49:06,077
Big Fat Bloody Loser.

1224
01:49:08,614 --> 01:49:11,947
What are you looking at? Get out!

1225
01:49:32,171 --> 01:49:33,433
Uncle

1226
01:49:33,505 --> 01:49:35,439
Where are you going?
- l'm going home.

1227
01:49:35,507 --> 01:49:37,771
Take me with you.
- No...

1228
01:49:37,843 --> 01:49:39,504
Please uncle
- You have to stay here.

1229
01:49:39,578 --> 01:49:40,909
Arjun needs you.

1230
01:49:40,979 --> 01:49:42,105
He's going to boarding school.

1231
01:49:42,181 --> 01:49:45,048
He'll need you when he gets back.

1232
01:49:45,717 --> 01:49:47,116
You're his only friend.

1233
01:49:47,186 --> 01:49:49,518
Please uncle.
- Come on Rohan.

1234
01:49:49,588 --> 01:49:50,919
Don't do this to me right now.

1235
01:49:50,989 --> 01:49:54,584
Please uncle. - Don't do this
to me right now. - Please uncle

1236
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:56,518
Uncle!

1237
01:50:16,215 --> 01:50:18,080
No Papa... No Papa...

1238
01:50:18,684 --> 01:50:21,551
Papa not that. Please...
Papa not that. Please...

1239
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:23,947
Sir please not that...

1240
01:50:52,851 --> 01:51:04,194
Against the rising waves Your
boat is helpless and tired.

1241
01:51:04,263 --> 01:51:15,265
Living one gasp at a time...
Your boat is helpless and tired.

1242
01:51:15,807 --> 01:51:26,274
Though the currents
are against you...

1243
01:51:26,351 --> 01:51:29,548
lt's time to make a difference.

1244
01:51:56,014 --> 01:52:00,110
Hoist the sail with courage...

1245
01:52:00,185 --> 01:52:07,023
This is all about your pride.

1246
01:52:07,592 --> 01:52:12,928
Shout ahoy and push ahead.

1247
01:52:12,998 --> 01:52:18,732
This is all about your pride.

1248
01:52:18,804 --> 01:52:24,333
Conquer. Raise the victory flag,

1249
01:52:24,409 --> 01:52:29,608
lt's time to do or die.

1250
01:52:30,182 --> 01:52:33,117
Fly and reach for the sun...

1251
01:52:33,185 --> 01:52:41,354
Leave behind the darkness.

1252
01:52:44,830 --> 01:52:46,627
This is my son Rohan.

1253
01:52:46,765 --> 01:52:48,824
Rohan, this is Madhavi.

1254
01:52:49,101 --> 01:52:50,762
Hi Rohan. lt's nice to meet you.

1255
01:52:51,036 --> 01:52:52,094
Hello.

1256
01:52:52,904 --> 01:52:54,303
And this is her daughter Richa.

1257
01:52:54,373 --> 01:52:56,034
Richa, say hello...

1258
01:52:56,174 --> 01:52:57,232
Hello.

1259
01:53:00,045 --> 01:53:01,376
Go wash up.

1260
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:03,238
Come on.

1261
01:53:09,855 --> 01:53:21,665
Powerful storms will shake you...

1262
01:53:21,733 --> 01:53:26,796
lf you surrender to a whirlpool ...

1263
01:53:26,872 --> 01:53:32,936
What good is your might?

1264
01:53:33,011 --> 01:53:35,844
Let the light
in your heart overcome

1265
01:53:35,914 --> 01:53:38,678
Break away from the night...

1266
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:43,847
Master the tides...

1267
01:53:44,356 --> 01:53:49,350
So that the seas may salute you.

1268
01:53:49,428 --> 01:53:52,693
Happy birthday to you.

1269
01:53:52,831 --> 01:53:53,923
You're 18 years old now.

1270
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:56,829
You've become a man, which
is why l'm giving this to you.

1271
01:53:57,836 --> 01:53:59,428
This was my grandfather's watch.

1272
01:54:01,306 --> 01:54:03,297
He gave it to my father
who then gave it to me

1273
01:54:04,843 --> 01:54:06,208
when l turned 18.

1274
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:10,077
See that you continue the tradition.

1275
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:21,725
Living one gasp at a time...

1276
01:54:21,793 --> 01:54:27,060
Your boat is helpless and tired.

1277
01:54:30,235 --> 01:54:32,795
Do you think you're the
Only one who has problems?

1278
01:54:33,271 --> 01:54:35,398
Are we all sitting on a lotus flower?

1279
01:54:36,475 --> 01:54:40,434
You don't have the balls
to stand up to your father.

1280
01:54:41,146 --> 01:54:46,345
So just sit here with us,
drink, write and cry like a girl.

1281
01:54:47,752 --> 01:54:52,348
Though the currents
are against you...

1282
01:54:52,424 --> 01:54:55,188
lt's time to make a difference.

1283
01:54:55,360 --> 01:55:01,765
We're having a blast in Bombay.
Remember Vikram's papa's restaurant?

1284
01:55:02,033 --> 01:55:04,900
Vikram convinced him to
let him run it for a month.

1285
01:55:05,103 --> 01:55:11,303
Uncle agreed. So Benoy and
l went to help. And guess what?

1286
01:55:11,776 --> 01:55:13,971
Profits doubled in our first month!

1287
01:55:14,045 --> 01:55:15,103
Really?

1288
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:18,775
Really, it's great. The restaurant
is ours. Uncle retired.

1289
01:55:19,050 --> 01:55:21,985
We work and eat goodies all day.

1290
01:55:22,521 --> 01:55:24,785
Girls are actually talking to us.

1291
01:55:25,190 --> 01:55:27,784
Benoy got laid!

1292
01:55:27,859 --> 01:55:31,124
His girlfriend hangs
with us all day...

1293
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:33,998
lf you were here you'd be so happy.

1294
01:55:34,199 --> 01:55:35,996
Come to Bombay.

1295
01:55:37,135 --> 01:55:38,193
Hello.

1296
01:55:38,937 --> 01:55:39,995
Rohan?

1297
01:55:40,405 --> 01:55:41,997
Rohan, are you there?

1298
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:46,140
Listen, l have to go,
l'll call later.

1299
01:55:46,211 --> 01:55:49,476
Wait, talk to Benoy and Vikram...

1300
01:55:50,215 --> 01:55:52,206
ROHAN!!!!

1301
01:58:13,024 --> 01:58:14,685
He was so drunk

1302
01:58:15,293 --> 01:58:17,022
That he couldn't even stand straight.

1303
01:58:18,363 --> 01:58:19,421
The car?

1304
01:58:20,965 --> 01:58:22,023
Buy a new one.

1305
01:58:22,967 --> 01:58:24,025
Where ?

1306
01:58:28,173 --> 01:58:30,164
Not him. The car.

1307
02:00:04,402 --> 02:00:05,460
When do you leave
for boarding school?

1308
02:00:06,271 --> 02:00:07,329
Tomorrow.

1309
02:00:08,072 --> 02:00:09,130
Good Luck.

1310
02:01:10,268 --> 02:01:11,326
Where are you going?

1311
02:01:12,403 --> 02:01:13,461
l'm leaving home.

1312
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:18,805
Why? Are you unhappy
with my marriage?

1313
02:01:18,877 --> 02:01:21,675
No. Not at all. l'm delighted.

1314
02:01:22,747 --> 02:01:24,339
Your frustrations will
come out somewhere else.

1315
02:01:24,749 --> 02:01:26,410
And Arjun won't need to
go to the hospital again.

1316
02:01:29,354 --> 02:01:30,412
Excuse me.

1317
02:01:33,825 --> 02:01:34,883
Rohan.

1318
02:01:35,894 --> 02:01:37,156
Rohan.

1319
02:01:58,650 --> 02:02:00,174
You fucker...

1320
02:04:31,435 --> 02:04:32,493
l'm going to Bombay.

1321
02:04:37,307 --> 02:04:38,365
What will you do there?

1322
02:04:40,043 --> 02:04:41,840
l'll work in Vikram's restaurant.

1323
02:04:44,047 --> 02:04:47,380
l'll write. l'll clean toilets.

1324
02:04:47,918 --> 02:04:49,317
But l won't ever come back.

1325
02:10:06,102 --> 02:10:13,565
Though our feet be chained,
Dreams will ever float free.

1326
02:10:15,378 --> 02:10:23,251
Even tender sprouts break
through the mighty earth.

1327
02:10:24,521 --> 02:10:33,122
Hopeful hearts can hold no fear...

1328
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:44,131
When they listen to
their inner voice.

1329
02:10:46,276 --> 02:10:47,334
Hi.

1330
02:10:50,747 --> 02:10:52,146
Sir's gone to get an autorickshaw.

1331
02:10:52,215 --> 02:10:53,273
Let him go.

1332
02:10:53,616 --> 02:10:54,674
You're coming with me.

1333
02:10:55,552 --> 02:10:57,144
Sir asked me to wait here.

1334
02:10:57,354 --> 02:11:02,155
Forget what Sir said. Do you
want to go to boarding school?

1335
02:11:02,826 --> 02:11:05,158
You will come with me wherever l go.

1336
02:11:09,766 --> 02:11:10,824
l'll be back in a moment.

1337
02:11:20,176 --> 02:11:24,772
How do you cage the morning rays?

1338
02:11:24,848 --> 02:11:29,444
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1339
02:11:29,652 --> 02:11:34,453
Just as soon as birds grow wings,

1340
02:11:34,524 --> 02:11:39,188
They soar high up in the sky.

1341
02:11:39,262 --> 02:11:43,858
How do you cage the morning rays?

1342
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:48,603
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1343
02:11:50,206 --> 02:11:51,264
Ready?

1344
02:11:51,341 --> 02:11:53,605
Just as soon as birds grow wings,

1345
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:58,679
They soar high up in the sky.

1346
02:12:17,634 --> 02:12:22,435
Freedom...

1347
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:26,575
Freedom...

1348
02:12:27,243 --> 02:12:36,447
Can never be asked for.

1349
02:12:36,853 --> 02:12:41,654
Freedom...

1350
02:12:41,858 --> 02:12:45,453
Freedom...

1351
02:12:46,529 --> 02:12:56,268
Seize it and live forever free.

1352
02:12:56,339 --> 02:13:00,742
l'm taking Arjun with me.

1353
02:13:01,010 --> 02:13:05,538
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1354
02:13:05,682 --> 02:13:10,483
Just as soon as birds grow wings,

1355
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:15,421
They soar high up in the sky.

1356
02:13:16,292 --> 02:13:18,283
l'm taking Arjun with me.

1357
02:13:18,561 --> 02:13:20,290
lf l leave him here he will become

1358
02:13:20,563 --> 02:13:22,360
another version of you.

1359
02:13:22,699 --> 02:13:26,567
One of you is enough for this world.

1360
02:13:27,303 --> 02:13:31,706
You will never
understand why this happened.

1361
02:13:32,442 --> 02:13:38,847
Because it's a word you've
never known or experienced...

1362
02:13:39,782 --> 02:13:40,840
Love.

1363
02:13:42,051 --> 02:13:46,317
Please don't try to find us. lf you
come within a 100 kilometers of us,

1364
02:13:46,523 --> 02:13:49,515
The police will know you beat Arjun.

1365
02:13:49,926 --> 02:13:53,327
Legally, it's a criminal offence.

1366
02:13:54,330 --> 02:13:57,322
Arjun can be a lot
more than just your slave.

1367
02:13:57,667 --> 02:14:00,329
He needs a family, not a cage.

1368
02:14:00,737 --> 02:14:04,798
He needs a future, which l will make
sure he gets, whatever the cost...

1369
02:14:05,475 --> 02:14:09,741
Congratulations on your new wife,
your new daughter, your new life.

1370
02:14:10,346 --> 02:14:12,405
Your son, Rohan.

1371
02:14:13,416 --> 02:14:22,552
ls life over?. Or is
it about to begin?

1372
02:14:23,693 --> 02:14:32,362
ls this nightfall?
Or is it a new dawn?

1373
02:14:32,769 --> 02:14:38,366
Will the future bring comfort?

1374
02:14:41,711 --> 02:14:48,776
Or will bring us to a crossroad?

1375
02:14:50,787 --> 02:14:58,717
Who knows what lies ahead...
