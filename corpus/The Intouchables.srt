1
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,582
Get out of my way!

2
00:01:58,707 --> 00:01:59,874
Ok, here they are.

3
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:03,791
Philippe, wake up now, I bet
you 100€ that I'll lose them.

4
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,124
Philippe? Deal.

5
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:07,832
Let's do this!

6
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,791
Gosh, you're on a good night.

7
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,582
Fuck.

8
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:49,082
You lost them alright.

9
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:52,832
Get out of the car!
Hands on the hood!

10
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:55,332
- I double.
- 200€ that they're escorting us.

11
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,124
You're gonna lose again.

12
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:59,082
-200€!

13
00:02:59,332 --> 00:03:00,791
- Come on! Show me your hands!

14
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:02,749
Your hands goddammit!

15
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:07,291
- Wait. I'm gonna explain.
- Shut up. Hands on the hood.

16
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,832
- Wait.
- Get out of the car. Now!

17
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,791
Take it easy!

18
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:16,541
He can't get out.
He can't even open the door.

19
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,374
Look at him for god's sake!

20
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:24,166
There's a wheel chair in the trunk.
He's disabled. Go check!

21
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,874
Get off me.

22
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,916
- He's telling the truth.
- SO!

23
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,666
What did you think?

24
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:35,999
You think I'm driving that fast.
For the fun of it?

25
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:40,541
I was going to the hospital.
I'm working for him. He's having a stroke!

26
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:41,985
The more we wait,
the worse it gets.

27
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:43,957
He can't move, he can't do anything.
That's why I'm here.

28
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,124
I think we have a problem here.

29
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,457
Come see this.

30
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,957
- What the fuck do we do now?
- That's right, think about it. Take your time.

31
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:59,207
But meanwhile call his 15 years old daughter
and tell his father is dead because of you!

32
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:02,832
Because if he's not taken care
of within 5 minutes, it's over.

33
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,416
But take your time.

34
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:09,457
Think. Think fast. He's dying!

35
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,749
Alright, don't lose any more time.
Go.

36
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,874
- Where are you going?
- ER.

37
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:33,374
We're gonna escort you, it's safer.
Let's go, we're escorting them!

38
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:36,874
They're gone. They're leaving.

39
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,374
Good.

40
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:41,166
Philippe, this is so gross.

41
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:44,582
I can't deal with that, how
do you produce this...

42
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:47,874
Alright, you'll really have to
get your license eventually.

43
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:50,291
Yes but meanwhile "we're gonna
escort you, it's safer".

44
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,249
A 200€ escort.

45
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:55,791
What? I never bet such
amounts of money.

46
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:59,541
Let's celebrate a little bit.

47
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:01,207
"We're gonna escort
you, it's safer."

48
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,332
Cool it. I helped you big time.

49
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,749
Philippe, an escort.
A safe escort!

50
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,082
Here he comes.

51
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:52,249
We took care of it.
A stretcher will be here in a second.

52
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,499
- Are you gonna be ok?
- Yeah, it's fine.

53
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,832
- Good luck.
- Whatever.

54
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:14,207
Now what?

55
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:17,207
Now you let me decide.

56
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:32,707
THE INTOUCHABLES

57
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:38,124
<i>Based on a true story.</i>

58
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:24,582
Do you have references?

59
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:27,374
Well yes. I validated my CAFARD.

60
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:30,541
A certificate of aptitude to
take care of disabled persons.

61
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:35,249
I validated it in a renowned institute
in the Landes country in 2001

62
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:38,332
I have a high school
"Proximity Services" diploma

63
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,207
and a bachelor's in "Social
and Familial Economy"

64
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:47,124
I don't... like... I mean...
I have been mostly studying rather than working.

65
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,499
What is your main motivation?

66
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,624
Money. Duh!

67
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:53,332
Mankind.

68
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:55,791
I'm all about mankind.

69
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,291
Good for you.

70
00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:01,499
To help others, I think.
It's good right? It's a good answer?

71
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:04,041
I like the neighbourhood.

72
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:07,166
I love disabled persons.
Since I was a little child actually.

73
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:11,416
To promotes disabled
people's autonomy, I'd say.

74
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:12,666
Their social insertion.

75
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,541
Sports too.
You gotta move, you know.

76
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,749
For the social life, I mean.

77
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:20,624
These people can't
do anything...

78
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:23,999
I saw... had my first
professional experience...

79
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:25,832
It was Mme Dupont Morathie.

80
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:29,166
A really old lady...

81
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:30,999
really old...

82
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:33,249
I assisted her...

83
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:35,666
until the end, day after day.

84
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:40,582
In geriatrics there were good times too.
We had King's cake... er...

85
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:44,791
Oh... I'm also an expert
in administrative stuff...

86
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:47,791
Financial aid... Welfare...

87
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,666
I... I don't know...

88
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:51,957
maybe you qualify?

89
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,291
You'll check, Magalie.
But I don't think so...

90
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,916
- Yvan Laprade?
- Yes.

91
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:10,416
- No no no, get out.. I've been waiting for 2 hours.
- It's my turn now.

92
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,416
Hello.

93
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,457
I'm coming to have
a paper signed.

94
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:21,666
Please take a seat.

95
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,249
Do you have references?

96
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:30,291
References? I do.

97
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:31,541
So?

98
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:32,749
We're all ears.

99
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:35,999
"Kool & the Gang",
"Earth, Wind & Fire".

100
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:39,041
Those are good
references, aren't they?

101
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:40,916
I don't know them. Take a seat.

102
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,582
If you don't know them, you don't
know anything about music.

103
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:46,457
I don't think I'm incult
when it comes to music.

104
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:48,916
- Even if I don't know you "Sool" whatever...
- NO.

105
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,166
"Kool & the Gang".

106
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:54,249
What about you?
You know Chopin, Schubert, Berlioz?

107
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,291
You're asking me
if I know Berlioz?

108
00:10:56,832 --> 00:10:58,499
I'd be surprised if YOU knew
anything about Berlioz.

109
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,457
I'm a specialist, though.

110
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:01,916
Oh really...

111
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,124
Who do you know there?

112
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,582
- Which building?
- What do you mean which building?

113
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:09,874
But, man...

114
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:12,874
Berlioz was a famous composer before
your residency was called after him.

115
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:15,499
Writer, critic of
the 19th century.

116
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:20,541
It's a joke. I know who Berlioz is.
But I see humour is like music for you.

117
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:24,374
You don't know
anything about it.

118
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:30,082
Tell us about your paper.

119
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:35,624
I need a signature...
To prove I came to the interview.

120
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:40,332
It says that unfortunately, despite my obvious qualities...
whatever usual bullshit you use

121
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:42,207
you're still not interested.

122
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,499
I need 3 of these to get
welfare money again.

123
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,707
I understand, welfare.

124
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,582
- You don't have any other motivation in life?
- Oh I do.

125
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:55,416
There's one right here.
This here is really motivating...

126
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,791
So, what's happening now?

127
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,624
Signing? Not signing?

128
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:03,957
I'm sorry I can't
sign it right now.

129
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:04,999
Why is that?

130
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:06,457
Why?

131
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:18,916
Oh yeah, that's a bit annoying.

132
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:22,541
Because I have a deadline,
and since I'm pretty late...

133
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:25,791
It's "a bit annoying", indeed.

134
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:28,291
Can't the motivation
sign for you?

135
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,416
No, Magalie can't do that.

136
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:33,499
It's a shame.

137
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,666
She could have dropped
in her number as well.

138
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,291
You'll have to come
back tomorrow.

139
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,374
9 am. Your paper will be signed.

140
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:42,166
I wouldn't want to deprive
you from welfare.

141
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:44,749
- Sorry I can't walk you to the door.
- It's all good.

142
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:48,582
Don't get up...
I mean stay seated.

143
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,999
See you tomorrow.

144
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,249
- Nina?
- Yeah?

145
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,707
- Is she here?
- No. She'll be back late.

146
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,124
No! Hey!

147
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,624
Don't use it now, it's
using all the water.

148
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:52,499
Stop the water!

149
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,374
And get out.

150
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:56,916
- I'm showering, what are you doing here?
- Leave me alone. - Get out!

151
00:13:57,249 --> 00:14:00,166
Make them leave. Come on.

152
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,374
Bitou, I'm not joking.

153
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:03,416
Nina!

154
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:05,832
Nina. Get out, you
and your fat belly!

155
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:08,999
Let it go!

156
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,041
Give me a towel.
Why are you still here...

157
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:12,457
Get out, all of you!

158
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:13,874
Bitou, come one.

159
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:15,332
Hey! Bitou!

160
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:16,791
What do you think you're doing?

161
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:18,916
Sit down.

162
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,082
What do you want?
Coca-Cola or this one?

163
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,332
I want Coca-Cola.

164
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:40,249
- Where do you come from?
- School.

165
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,207
Can you wipe the trash can?

166
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,749
Where are you going now?

167
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:47,624
Horse-riding.

168
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:49,832
That's right, act
like a smart ass.

169
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:29,124
It's for you.

170
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,999
Where have you been?

171
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:36,749
- Holidays.
- Holidays?

172
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:39,124
You think people don't
talk around here?

173
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:41,207
That I'm incredibly stupid?

174
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:45,041
You've been gone for 6 months.
Not one phone call. Nothing.

175
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,624
And you come back, as if nothing
happened, giving me a Kinder egg?

176
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,582
Do you think I'm gonna
pay the rent with that?

177
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:52,707
The groceries?

178
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,332
(african language)

179
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,999
(african language)

180
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,291
Do you think it's a hotel here?

181
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:02,457
Look at me when I'm
talking to you.

182
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:06,166
Moron.

183
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:10,207
- It's impossible to talk with you.
- You want to talk?

184
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:11,707
Alright.

185
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:15,874
I'm listening.

186
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,957
I'm listening now.

187
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,916
You know Driss...

188
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,332
I prayed a lot for you.

189
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:32,999
But god forgive me...

190
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,207
I have other children.

191
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:39,374
I still have hope for them.

192
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:43,957
I don't want to see you
around here any more.

193
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,416
You're taking all your stuff.

194
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,041
And you get the
fuck out of here.

195
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,041
Got it?

196
00:16:51,332 --> 00:16:52,582
Leave.

197
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,916
Leave!

198
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:12,166
...and he's gone!

199
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:15,332
It's a good one, right?

200
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,332
Ok, I'm off.

201
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:21,582
You don't think it was funny?

202
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:18,166
Yes?

203
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:20,957
- I'm here for my paper.
- Yes, I was waiting for you.

204
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:24,916
- You know... the paper.
- Get in.

205
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,749
Can you tell Philippe
the boy is here?

206
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:39,999
Of course.

207
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:47,332
- So?
- The beats are not quite done.

208
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:51,332
- But the radish are good.
- Ok. - Hello.

209
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:59,166
Let's go.

210
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:04,332
Just so you know, he
had a rough night.

211
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,249
Just like you, apparently.

212
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:08,582
The day starts at 7

213
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,582
with the nurse.

214
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:14,041
He needs 2 to 3 hours
of care every morning.

215
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,499
I'm warning you, most people
give up after a week.

216
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,832
They come and go pretty fast.

217
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,082
Well...

218
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,249
I like the furniture, the
music, it's cool and all...

219
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,874
but I don't think I'll buy it.

220
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,166
And I don't have the whole day.

221
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:31,166
Listen, I was asked to give you a tour,
believe me I also have better things to do.

222
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:33,041
It's almost done anyway.

223
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,541
Here, you can communicate
with a babyphone.

224
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:38,374
It's like a Walkie-Talkie.
You hear him, he hears you.

225
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:42,707
According to the contract,
you also have your own room.

226
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,082
The toilets.

227
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,499
And a bathroom.

228
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,874
A private bathroom.

229
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:55,457
Hello...

230
00:20:55,624 --> 00:20:57,707
It's here.

231
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,374
He's waiting for you.

232
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:16,374
One minute...

233
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,374
So I signed your paper.

234
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:32,541
It's in an envelope,
on the little table.

235
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,916
By the way, how is it to be forced
to rely on others for a living?

236
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:41,916
What?

237
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:46,999
You don't have a problem living
from other people's work?

238
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,832
I'm good, what about you?

239
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:54,207
Do you think you'd
be able to work?

240
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:56,249
I mean with duties,
a schedule...

241
00:21:56,457 --> 00:21:57,916
Responsibilities.

242
00:21:58,124 --> 00:22:00,666
I was wrong. You're funny.

243
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:03,791
I'm so funny I'm ready to take
you on a one month trial.

244
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:07,332
Do you want the day
to think about it?

245
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:12,332
I don't think you'll
make it past two weeks.

246
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,124
What?

247
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:43,749
You can't forget a single
bone or a single muscle.

248
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:44,999
Everything has to move.

249
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,707
We want to keep the skin
and the joints healthy.

250
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,499
You'll have to be
very meticulous.

251
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:53,707
Rigorous.

252
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,957
Ok? You get it?

253
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,832
Hey, wake up!

254
00:22:58,082 --> 00:22:59,291
Sleep at night.

255
00:22:59,582 --> 00:23:02,082
- I'm not sleeping.
- Come help me.

256
00:23:02,374 --> 00:23:05,707
We're going to bring
Philippe to his chair.

257
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:07,916
And then to the shower.

258
00:23:09,707 --> 00:23:11,207
You know what?

259
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,999
Try yourself. Show me.

260
00:23:21,124 --> 00:23:22,707
Don't be afraid. Go ahead.

261
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,499
I'm not afraid.

262
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,624
- There. Good enough?
- Wait!

263
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:43,124
Never let him go until
he's all strapped.

264
00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:45,374
It's one of my sins.

265
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,499
No one told me.

266
00:23:49,624 --> 00:23:52,041
I'm in training.

267
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:55,582
Do you want gloves or what?
Rub harder, for god's sake.

268
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:58,791
It doesn't foam!
It's a weird shampoo.

269
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,624
- How is it going?
- I'm washing his hair...

270
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:02,041
but it doesn't foam.

271
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:03,249
What do you mean?

272
00:24:03,707 --> 00:24:05,957
What the hell...
are you kidding me?

273
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,374
You put the cream for
his feet in his hair.

274
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:09,874
Wait, wait...

275
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:14,791
Please tell me you can read.

276
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,832
You look really
talented, don't you?

277
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,499
They look exactly the same.
Why isn't there only one for everything?

278
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,874
There are 20 of them.

279
00:24:22,124 --> 00:24:24,541
Ok, move on now.
I won't stay here for 2 hours.

280
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:28,499
- So I'm using this one?
- The one that says "shampoo".

281
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:32,541
- Are you gonna be ok?
- Of course, he'll be ok.

282
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:35,166
My feet have never
been styled so well.

283
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:38,374
Go have your lunch, Marcelle.
Everything is fine.

284
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:41,874
Wow, do these come with a skirt?

285
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:46,166
Those are contension stockings.
If I don't wear them, my blood won't flow

286
00:24:46,457 --> 00:24:48,499
and I'll pass out.

287
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:53,624
I'm not putting stocking on you.

288
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:55,666
We're gonna have a problem here.

289
00:24:55,832 --> 00:24:59,499
Since I won't do it, we'll have to...
at a point... I mean...

290
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,707
we'll have to figure out if...
Marcelle!

291
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:04,207
Maybe she can come back...

292
00:25:04,582 --> 00:25:06,041
and do it herself.

293
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:09,582
Since she's a girl and
everything, she knows how to.

294
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:12,207
I don't even know why we're
debating, I'm not gonna do it.

295
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:16,166
Even for you, at this point you'd
probably better pass out...

296
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:21,832
You have to say no, to stand up for yourself.
Marcelle! We're not going to do the stockings.

297
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:36,332
What's the matter, you're dealing with the stockings,
you have a cute little earring, I think it's coherent.

298
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:39,082
Easy on the sass, alright?

299
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:41,541
Looks like you
have experience...

300
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:45,041
No? You never thought about...

301
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:48,832
starting a salon or something?

302
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,749
Ok. Done.

303
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:54,749
Now what are these gloves for?

304
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:57,207
Er... we're going to wait
a while more for this.

305
00:25:57,499 --> 00:25:59,166
You're not quite ready.

306
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:01,166
No. He's not quite ready.

307
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:04,166
What does it mean, Marcelle?

308
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:06,707
- What is that?
- We'll explain at a point.

309
00:26:06,957 --> 00:26:08,499
Marcelle, we have to talk...

310
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,707
There's a problem
with the training.

311
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:13,874
It's not about being ready.
I do not do that.

312
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:16,166
I don't empty a stranger's butt.

313
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,249
I don't even empty
a friend's butt.

314
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:19,832
I usually don't empty butts.

315
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:22,082
It's a matter of principles.

316
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:26,332
Can we talk about this later?
When I'm done eating, for example?

317
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:31,666
No.

318
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:34,499
No use speaking about it later.
I'm done with this.

319
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:36,791
It's weird, I don't like it.

320
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:40,249
I didn't say anything about the stockings.
But it cost me.

321
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,999
I'm making compromises,
please do the same for me.

322
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:46,707
- I'm done with the butt-emptying issue.
- I think I get it.

323
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:48,666
It's not right. I'm done.

324
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:50,999
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you.

325
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,499
- Pretty, huh?
- I love it.

326
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,166
Am I bothering you?

327
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:09,457
Is it a theatre or what?

328
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:11,582
- I'm trying to eat here.
- Hey, what's up?

329
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:16,582
- Do you know where I can find a beer?
- Try in your hair.

330
00:27:17,832 --> 00:27:19,582
We had two 6-packs,
did you take them?

331
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:20,707
I don't know. I don't care.

332
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:22,999
So take your feather
duster with you and leave.

333
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:24,624
Come on, let's get out of here.

334
00:27:24,874 --> 00:27:27,916
It's the new guy
working for my father.

335
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:30,916
The "guy" has a name you know.

336
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,457
Damn.

337
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:58,832
- What?
- Sorry.

338
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,541
- What happened?
- Nothing.

339
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:02,624
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

340
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,291
I'm massaging.

341
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:19,582
That is nuts.

342
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:23,374
Are you having fun?

343
00:28:23,957 --> 00:28:26,082
You don't feel
anything down there!

344
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:27,124
What the hell...

345
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,874
- What are you doing again?
- Experiments.

346
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:31,249
He doesn't give a shit,
he feels nothing! Look!

347
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,416
Stop it, you're gonna burn him.

348
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:44,082
Lawyer.

349
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:46,332
Lawyer.

350
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:51,416
No... this is personal.
I'll read it later.

351
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,874
Personal file?

352
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,416
Ok.

353
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:02,082
Trash.

354
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:03,916
She has a little
something, though.

355
00:29:05,124 --> 00:29:07,707
Can't we create a hooker file?

356
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:16,416
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks.

357
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:24,082
Please.

358
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:28,666
Sorry.

359
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:30,332
I'm sorry.

360
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,416
Fuck, I keep forgetting.

361
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,916
Fuck, sorry.

362
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,207
That's good.

363
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:57,374
Driss?

364
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,249
Can you come?

365
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:01,332
Do you hear me, Driss?

366
00:30:02,332 --> 00:30:04,166
Can you please come?

367
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:06,749
Driss.

368
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:09,291
Driss.

369
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:17,124
What?

370
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,999
It's almost 9.
Philippe is waiting.

371
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:23,249
It's 9 already? I lost track of time,
it took forever for my bath to foam.

372
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:26,791
- This room's a piggery.
- Make me a coffee, I'm coming.

373
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:29,916
What about the babyphone?
It's supposed to always be with you.

374
00:30:30,082 --> 00:30:34,666
And I want Nutella! Not jams with
weird fruits that nobody knows of.

375
00:30:53,624 --> 00:30:56,166
I'm not going in there.

376
00:30:56,624 --> 00:30:57,791
Even you!

377
00:30:57,916 --> 00:31:01,957
I'm not gonna load you in
the back like a horse.

378
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,624
What about this one?

379
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:07,416
This one is not fit for me.

380
00:31:09,874 --> 00:31:14,832
- What do you mean?
- I have to be pragmatic.

381
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,791
Pragmatic?

382
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:22,124
Oh damn!

383
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:24,416
Son of a...

384
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,124
Feels good, right?

385
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:28,499
- It does!
- So good.

386
00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:30,999
It's nervous!

387
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,332
Let's go.

388
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:44,749
That's the neighbour again.
He always parks here.

389
00:31:44,957 --> 00:31:48,416
He thinks it's his
own parking spot.

390
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:52,666
I see some change coming.

391
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:56,541
- Hi, how is it going Patrick Swayze?
- What?

392
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,791
Would you like a cup of coffee?

393
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,874
- Can I see that?
- What the...

394
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:02,124
Come here.

395
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:06,291
Now read this. Read!

396
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:07,624
"No Parking."

397
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:10,541
- Louder. I can't hear you.
- "No Parking"! - That's the way to do it.

398
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12,166
- Read the bottom of it.
- "Reserved spot".

399
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:15,207
Now you keep that in mind, and
you get the fuck out of here.

400
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:17,249
Hurry up.

401
00:32:17,374 --> 00:32:18,916
Get lost!

402
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:30,957
We're opening on tuesday.
It will be sold by tuesday night.

403
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:34,082
Can we go? You've been
looking at this for an hour.

404
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,166
You're gonna have
to move at a point.

405
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:38,707
This painting expresses
an overwhelming serenity.

406
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,707
And some violence as well.

407
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:42,041
I find it very moving.

408
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,707
Red stains on a white
background are moving?

409
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:47,166
How much for this thing?

410
00:32:47,457 --> 00:32:50,249
I think it's 30000€.
I can check if you want.

411
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:54,457
You'd better check indeed.
It sounds exaggerated.

412
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,332
You're not gonna pay 30000
€ for this piece of crap!

413
00:32:59,582 --> 00:33:01,916
- Unbelievable.
- You'd better believe it.

414
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:04,832
This dude nosebleed on a white
board and asks 30000€ for it?

415
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:09,666
Tell me Driss, why do you think
people are interested in art?

416
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:13,457
- I don't know, it's a business.
- No.

417
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:16,457
That's because it's the only
thing one leaves behind.

418
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:21,166
That's bullshit. For 50 bucks and a stop at a
hardware store, I can leave something behind as well.

419
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,082
I can even add extra blue
for free if you wan.

420
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:26,416
Stop talking nonsense.
Give me a M&M's.

421
00:33:27,082 --> 00:33:28,291
No.

422
00:33:29,582 --> 00:33:31,332
Give me a M&M's.

423
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,791
No feet, No sweets.

424
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:38,874
Hey, I'm joking.

425
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:40,541
It's a joke!

426
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:42,874
- Oh it's a joke!
- Well yeah!

427
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,041
- A joke...
- A good one, right?

428
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,499
Really funny.

429
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:48,832
It's a classic.

430
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:51,541
No feet, No sweets.

431
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,166
Give me one.

432
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:55,166
- It's so good!
- Cool it.

433
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:56,832
Oh come on!

434
00:33:57,249 --> 00:33:59,541
No legs, Philippe.

435
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:04,082
I'll say it again for the tight-ass chick.
Too bad there's no audience.

436
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:09,749
Sorry, I was wrong
about the price.

437
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:11,082
- Sounds right.
- Yes.

438
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:13,791
It's 41.500€.

439
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,207
I'll take it.

440
00:34:16,082 --> 00:34:17,166
Really.

441
00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:27,832
Hi, Philippe.

442
00:34:28,832 --> 00:34:30,416
How are you doing?

443
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:32,874
You summoned me, I'm here.

444
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,332
I'm listening.

445
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:36,707
What's so important?

446
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:40,207
I didn't 'summon' you...

447
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:47,666
Can't you guess?

448
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:51,291
Who is this guy?

449
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:53,541
Everybody's worried.

450
00:34:53,832 --> 00:34:56,541
Yvonne told me he's
unstable, brutal.

451
00:34:56,832 --> 00:34:58,999
He hit a neighbour.

452
00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:02,874
Philippe, you know better than
me you have to be careful.

453
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:06,291
You can't let anybody
come at your place.

454
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:08,916
Especially given
your condition...

455
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,541
In this case...

456
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:14,916
I'm not quite sure you know
who you're dealing with.

457
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:17,957
Go on...

458
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,832
I have contacts in the police.

459
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:23,166
He's not Al Capone, but...

460
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:26,332
he's not mother Theresa either.

461
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:31,041
He's just out of prison.
6 months for robbing a jewelry.

462
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:33,832
If at least he was qualified...

463
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,999
but I hear he sucks.

464
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:39,707
Be careful. You know guys from
the suburbs have no mercy.

465
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:42,582
That's it.

466
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:45,457
That's what I want. No thanks.

467
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:50,582
He often hands me the phone, you know why?
He just forgets.

468
00:35:50,832 --> 00:35:53,707
So you're right.
He doesn't really feel any empathy for me.

469
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:58,957
But he's tall, strong, healthy,
and not as dumb as you think.

470
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:02,541
So for now, given my
'condition' like you say...

471
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:06,707
I don't give a damn about where
he comes from and what he's done.

472
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,374
As you want.

473
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,541
That's all you wanted to say?

474
00:36:17,082 --> 00:36:18,582
Hey, Magalie.

475
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:20,582
- Do you have a minute?
- No, not really.

476
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:23,457
I just want to show you
something really fast.

477
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:26,791
- What is it?
- Don't freak out, you'll see.

478
00:36:27,082 --> 00:36:30,916
- One minute, that's it.
- Deal.

479
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:38,832
- So?
- So I have a bathtub.

480
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,166
See.

481
00:36:41,374 --> 00:36:44,082
- Really fascinating...
- Yeah.

482
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:46,707
- So what?
- I was thinking...

483
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:48,457
we could take a bath.

484
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,082
It's big. There's enough room.

485
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:54,124
I have bath salts, shower gel...

486
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:55,791
Alright.

487
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:58,124
Why not, after all?

488
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,749
Exactly. Why not.

489
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:02,332
Go ahead.

490
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:05,666
- Start undressing.
- Oh you're gonna play it naughty.

491
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,124
I like that.

492
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:10,957
I'm taking off my clothes.
No problem.

493
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:14,582
What?

494
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,499
Where are you going?

495
00:37:16,749 --> 00:37:19,041
You agreed!

496
00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:22,791
We don't even have
to use the salts.

497
00:37:25,082 --> 00:37:26,124
What are you looking at?

498
00:37:26,332 --> 00:37:30,332
I'm always anxious in the
morning, when the mail arrives.

499
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,249
As Apollinaire once said...

500
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,291
Quote...

501
00:37:34,457 --> 00:37:36,457
'I'm desperate when I
don't hear from you...

502
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:38,666
Wait.

503
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:40,832
I'm lost, you're going too fast.

504
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:42,999
I was at: "As Apollinaire
once said...".

505
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:47,332
Quote 'I'm desperate when
I don't hear from you...

506
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:53,582
You might not get it, but
this is an intimate time.

507
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,374
- Nope, I don't get it.
- Give it back.

508
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,332
I'll shut it down
if you explain.

509
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,957
There's nothing to explain.

510
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:03,166
He's sending letters.

511
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:04,624
Letters?

512
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:07,499
- To whom?
- To women, usually.

513
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,707
Tell me, who is it?

514
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:13,624
There's one in particular.
Eleonore.

515
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,957
Who is Eleonore?
I've never seen her.

516
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,249
How come?

517
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:20,999
That's how epistolary
relationships work.

518
00:38:23,332 --> 00:38:25,207
It means they write letters

519
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,374
they only communicate by mail.

520
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:30,332
I'm not stupid, I got it.

521
00:38:32,332 --> 00:38:34,582
Are those the blue letters?

522
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:38,457
What a seducer.

523
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,999
He's 'epistoling' like a boss.

524
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:43,666
What about you?

525
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:46,249
Isn't there someone?

526
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,624
Even Albert, the gardener?

527
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,166
- Not at all.
- Come on, I noticed.

528
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:54,166
He always has a smile for you.

529
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,791
Am I right?

530
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:59,499
- Am I right or not?
- Stop it now. It's ridiculous.

531
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,416
- So did he get some or what?

532
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:04,916
- What are you talking about?
- Did he plant his own cucumber?

533
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:07,416
What?

534
00:39:09,124 --> 00:39:11,791
- I can't believe you...
- Albert, Albert...

535
00:39:12,457 --> 00:39:14,124
- Soon.
- No!

536
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,291
Soon, trust me.

537
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,082
Fuck.

538
00:39:40,957 --> 00:39:42,207
Hello...

539
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,582
Are you ok?

540
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:52,666
Do you need music?

541
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:17,041
Stay calm.

542
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,582
Calm down, Philippe.

543
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:29,999
Philippe. Hey, Philippe.

544
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,582
Try to relax.

545
00:40:38,957 --> 00:40:40,874
Breathe slowly.

546
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,082
Can you hear me?

547
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:55,916
Slowly.

548
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:03,041
You're gonna be ok.

549
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:28,916
I need air.

550
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:30,832
Air!

551
00:42:10,332 --> 00:42:13,249
The fresh air feels great.

552
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:17,582
- What time is it?
- I don't know, around 4 am.

553
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:22,916
I haven't been out in Paris by this
time of the day in a long time.

554
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,041
What happened?

555
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:28,166
Medication side effect.

556
00:42:28,457 --> 00:42:31,624
Doctors call these
"Ghost pains".

557
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:38,499
I rather say that I'm a frozen
steak thrown in a burning pan.

558
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:42,374
I don't feel anything,
but it's still painful.

559
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:48,124
It has to stop. There must be
something that will relieve you.

560
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:53,457
Yup. This could relieve me.

561
00:42:55,249 --> 00:42:57,457
Well, we're all a little sick
when it comes to this...

562
00:42:57,624 --> 00:43:01,499
I might even be sicker than you.

563
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:05,916
By the way, I meant to ask you.
About the ladies...

564
00:43:06,082 --> 00:43:09,041
Can you...? How does it work?

565
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:11,666
I have to adapt.

566
00:43:11,832 --> 00:43:13,999
But concretely...
Can you do it or not?

567
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:19,791
I don't know if you're aware, but I have
no feelings between my neck and my toes.

568
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:22,249
So you can't.

569
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:25,582
It's complicated.

570
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:28,916
I can, but I'm not always
the one to decide when.

571
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,916
Also, there's pleasure
to be found elsewhere.

572
00:43:31,207 --> 00:43:32,291
Really?

573
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,124
You can't imagine.

574
00:43:34,332 --> 00:43:37,166
I sure can't. What do you mean?

575
00:43:37,457 --> 00:43:40,499
The ears, for instance.

576
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:42,207
What about the ears?

577
00:43:42,374 --> 00:43:46,791
It's a very sensitive,
erogenous area.

578
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,916
So you get your ears licked?

579
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:53,499
I couldn't have
thought about that.

580
00:43:56,749 --> 00:43:58,207
Philippe.

581
00:44:12,624 --> 00:44:15,666
- Hit that. It will help.
- What is this bullshit.

582
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:18,124
Come on, it can't get any worse.

583
00:44:18,582 --> 00:44:19,791
Hit it.

584
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:21,832
Come on, harder.

585
00:44:22,457 --> 00:44:24,749
Alright, let's share.

586
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:27,874
More.

587
00:44:31,874 --> 00:44:35,207
- A bit more.
- Enough for tonight.

588
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:38,707
Sorry to bring this back, but I'm
really curious about the ear thing.

589
00:44:38,874 --> 00:44:42,957
So if you have red ears,
it means you're turned on?

590
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:45,082
That's it.

591
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:49,041
Sometimes I even wake
up with hard lobes.

592
00:44:49,749 --> 00:44:52,249
Both of them?

593
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:59,332
I met my wife Alice when we were
studying political sciences. We were 20.

594
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,499
She was tall and elegant.

595
00:45:01,707 --> 00:45:03,791
Joyful bright eyes.

596
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:06,957
I saw pictures at your place.
It's the blonde one, right?

597
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,249
Not bad.

598
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:10,874
We had an incredible
story together.

599
00:45:11,082 --> 00:45:13,791
I wish you the same.

600
00:45:14,082 --> 00:45:17,499
God I loved her so much.

601
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:30,332
Then she got pregnant
once, twice...

602
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,791
She had five miscarriages.

603
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:41,082
Finally the doctors gave a diagnosis.
She didn't have much longer.

604
00:45:41,249 --> 00:45:44,582
We decided to adopt anyway.

605
00:45:56,874 --> 00:45:58,416
Sir.

606
00:45:58,624 --> 00:46:00,541
Please.

607
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:03,457
Please!

608
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:09,541
Yes.

609
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:11,249
I want...

610
00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:14,082
I'm gonna have a tarte tatin.

611
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:18,416
But cooked all the way.
Because the chocolate cake had a problem.

612
00:46:18,707 --> 00:46:20,249
It was all fluid inside...

613
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:21,791
flowing everywhere.
It was weird.

614
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:25,957
That's what a 'mi-cuit'
is supposed to do, sir.

615
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:27,957
- That's why?
- Yes.

616
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:30,082
I'm still gonna
have a tarte tatin.

617
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:32,332
I always liked competition.

618
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:34,707
Extreme sports, speed...

619
00:46:35,124 --> 00:46:37,832
Going faster, higher...

620
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:40,332
I had it all with paragliding.

621
00:46:40,499 --> 00:46:43,916
I got high, could see everything.
And breathe.

622
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:48,874
I was raised with the conviction I was
good enough to pee on the whole world.

623
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:52,957
I'd like to drink something.
My mouth feels dry.

624
00:46:54,457 --> 00:46:57,666
That's one of the side effects
when you smoke weed..

625
00:46:57,957 --> 00:47:00,957
- What are the other ones?
- It makes you hungry...

626
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,666
And chatty.

627
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:11,499
And then a day of bad weather, a day
I shouldn't have gone paragliding.

628
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,499
But you did.

629
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:19,124
Maybe to to share Alice's pain,
because I knew she wouldn't make it.

630
00:47:19,374 --> 00:47:21,916
In the end, two
broken cervicals.

631
00:47:22,082 --> 00:47:24,582
And only my head
left to get high.

632
00:47:24,832 --> 00:47:28,957
The pain didn't
take my mind away.

633
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:34,457
My true disability is not
having to be in a wheel chair.

634
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:37,999
It's having to be without her.

635
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,249
What do the doctors say?

636
00:47:43,457 --> 00:47:46,916
You know, with the recent progress,
they're gonna keep me alive until 70.

637
00:47:47,207 --> 00:47:49,624
With massages and medication.

638
00:47:49,874 --> 00:47:54,207
It's expensive...
but I'm a rich tetraplegic.

639
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,874
I would shoot myself.

640
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,082
Well, you can't even do that
when you're tetraplegic.

641
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:03,207
Oh shit. That's right.

642
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:06,457
That's tough, man.

643
00:48:07,332 --> 00:48:08,999
What day are we today?

644
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:10,624
I don't know, the
8th or the 9th...

645
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:12,791
So it's official!

646
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:15,707
- What?
- You did it.

647
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:17,999
Your trial is over.

648
00:48:18,249 --> 00:48:21,249
- So I'm hired?
- Of course you're hired.

649
00:48:21,374 --> 00:48:24,041
- Can I count on you?
- Yeah.

650
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:25,124
Good.

651
00:48:25,332 --> 00:48:29,332
Then give me the
'Faberg? egg back.

652
00:48:30,082 --> 00:48:31,541
It's a gift from Alice.

653
00:48:31,749 --> 00:48:35,957
She got me one each year we were together.
I have 25 of them.

654
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:38,499
They're really important to me.

655
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,291
I don't know, what do you...

656
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:42,791
I didn't do it.

657
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:44,999
What kind of egg is that?

658
00:48:58,207 --> 00:49:00,541
Nina.

659
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,957
- What are you doing here?
- Hurry up, get in the car.

660
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:09,916
Put your seatbelt on.

661
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,832
How are you?

662
00:49:28,249 --> 00:49:30,707
How is school?

663
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:33,874
Why don't you answer my texts?

664
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:37,041
I was busy.

665
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:42,499
So tell me, who did you
talk to on the phone?

666
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:44,666
A cop, he wanted to talk to mom.

667
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:48,499
I faked her voice and told him
someone was going to pick him up.

668
00:49:50,082 --> 00:49:52,957
Did you find my egg?

669
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:56,499
Did you find it or not?

670
00:49:57,082 --> 00:50:00,499
I don't care about your stupid egg.
I didn't find it anyway.

671
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:10,541
What did you tell them?

672
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,249
Nothing.
I had nothing to tell them.

673
00:50:12,457 --> 00:50:14,957
I only had 30 grams, you know the law.
They couldn't do anything.

674
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:18,124
They kept me in custody and
eventually had to let me go.

675
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:20,624
Do you want to have a sandwich?

676
00:50:20,749 --> 00:50:23,332
- I'm not getting in this car.
- Cool it.

677
00:50:23,624 --> 00:50:25,291
- Let me go!
- Shut up. Who's taking you home?

678
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:28,332
- Who's taking you home?

679
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,624
- Get lost.
- It's none of your business.

680
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:32,791
- Get lost!

681
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:49,916
Her polished eyes are carved
in delicate minerals,

682
00:50:50,124 --> 00:50:53,541
And in this strange and
symbolic nature...

683
00:50:53,874 --> 00:50:56,124
'And in this strange'

684
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:58,707
"'and symbolic"

685
00:50:59,249 --> 00:51:02,082
- 'nature'
- How boring is that?

686
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:07,749
'Where the pure angel merges
with the antic Sphinx'

687
00:51:08,082 --> 00:51:09,999
I never know if 'Sphinx'
takes a 'i' or a 'y'?

688
00:51:10,332 --> 00:51:13,499
I'm so bored by all this.

689
00:51:13,957 --> 00:51:15,916
It's a "I".

690
00:51:16,124 --> 00:51:18,832
Do you really have to go
through this bullshit?

691
00:51:18,999 --> 00:51:20,999
A sphynx, daisies, angels...

692
00:51:21,624 --> 00:51:24,499
Would you care for a
guy telling you this?

693
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,666
Of course, some use a
more basic method.

694
00:51:28,957 --> 00:51:30,916
What's next?

695
00:51:31,124 --> 00:51:32,916
What does Eleonore look like?

696
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:35,999
I don't know, I don't care.

697
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:39,166
It's intellectual. Emotional.

698
00:51:39,457 --> 00:51:42,249
It comes before the physical
relationship for me.

699
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,249
Intellectual alright, but
what if she looks like a dog?

700
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:47,124
You'd be having an intellectual
relationship with a dog.

701
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:48,416
Very elegant.

702
00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:49,916
Really.

703
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,749
What else.

704
00:51:53,082 --> 00:51:54,207
Bravo.

705
00:51:54,374 --> 00:51:57,082
How long has it been going on?

706
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:03,957
He's such a pain in the ass.

707
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:06,666
Six months.

708
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,207
Six months?

709
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,124
And you've never seen her?

710
00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:12,499
She really might be ugly.
Or fat.

711
00:52:12,707 --> 00:52:14,041
Or even disabled.

712
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,249
You should add that after the poem:
'by the way, how much do you weigh'?

713
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:18,207
Write it.

714
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:21,749
Thanks a lot for your
useful advice, Driss.

715
00:52:22,082 --> 00:52:23,874
Let's get back to it.

716
00:52:24,082 --> 00:52:25,582
Where was I?

717
00:52:26,707 --> 00:52:32,041
I think a sphynx was eating daisies,
running in the fields, doing weird stuff.

718
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:33,374
Let's see...

719
00:52:34,124 --> 00:52:36,749
'strange and symbolic nature'

720
00:52:36,999 --> 00:52:40,624
And in this strange and
symbolic nature...

721
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:41,999
You have to call her.

722
00:52:42,332 --> 00:52:46,374
- Where the pure angel merges
with the antic sphynx...

723
00:52:46,582 --> 00:52:48,332
I'm telling you. Call her.

724
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:52,874
Spot it, Driss.
I'm better at written communication.

725
00:52:53,249 --> 00:52:54,332
Unbelievable.

726
00:52:54,499 --> 00:52:58,707
Alright, but I'm gonna look for her
phone number, it stresses me out.

727
00:52:59,124 --> 00:53:00,082
Hey!

728
00:53:01,957 --> 00:53:03,666
She's from the north...
that's not good.

729
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:05,416
Leave this envelope.

730
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:08,749
Never has a 'Miss France' come from the north.
They usually look like crap over there.

731
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:10,624
Give the envelope back now.

732
00:53:10,832 --> 00:53:14,291
She wrote her phone number, god damn it.
It's a sign. She wants you to call her!

733
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:16,582
Please. Let it go.

734
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:20,291
She wrote her phone number, Philippe.
What do you think? It means <i>"Call Me".</i>

735
00:53:20,499 --> 00:53:22,666
"I want to lick your ear lobe".

736
00:53:22,874 --> 00:53:24,457
- Of course, Philippe.
- You're not calling her, are you?

737
00:53:24,707 --> 00:53:27,374
She doesn't give a shit about poetry.
Six fucking months of poetry...

738
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:28,916
He's bonkers.

739
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:32,457
- I won't talk to her.
- I'm gonna check if she has a weird accent.

740
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:33,749
Northern accent sucks..

741
00:53:34,124 --> 00:53:35,457
Put down the phone!

742
00:53:35,624 --> 00:53:38,916
- She wants a piece of Philippe.
- She's gonna have some.

743
00:53:39,124 --> 00:53:39,957
Hello.

744
00:53:40,249 --> 00:53:42,124
Nice voice, for a start.

745
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:43,999
Hello...

746
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:45,332
- No.

747
00:53:46,082 --> 00:53:46,916
- No.

748
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:49,874
- Hello...
- Improvise, talk about daisies and shit...

749
00:53:50,124 --> 00:53:51,207
- Eleonore?

750
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:52,541
- It's Philippe.

751
00:53:53,249 --> 00:53:54,666
Well I...

752
00:53:54,874 --> 00:53:58,249
I'm calling you because I really
wanted to hear your voice.

753
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:02,457
And so far, your 'Hello'
already fills me with joy.

754
00:54:02,749 --> 00:54:05,166
Hold on. I'm gonna get her.

755
00:54:05,957 --> 00:54:08,916
Stop with you
complicated sentences.

756
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:12,082
- Hello.
- Eleonore. It's Philippe.

757
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,457
Philippe?

758
00:54:13,832 --> 00:54:16,832
Igen. Szerettem volna 韗ni
egy levelet, azt醤...

759
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:20,832
I was writing you a letter.
And I thought, why not simply call her.

760
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:23,332
Don't forget to ask
about her weight.

761
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:25,832
- Pardon me?
- Nothing.

762
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:27,166
I'm grieving.

763
00:54:27,749 --> 00:54:28,916
I want to cry.

764
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:31,291
I'm afraid.
Lord give me peace...

765
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:32,999
Exactly, that's it!

766
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:34,582
I can't corner you.

767
00:54:34,874 --> 00:54:36,999
- How great that you love<i> "Rimbaud".</i>
- Sorry.

768
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:38,707
- I was first in line.
- Eleonore.

769
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:40,874
I'm glad.

770
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:43,249
Yes, I am.

771
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:45,957
- What a big mouth... he can't be stopped.
- I'm sending you kisses.

772
00:54:47,582 --> 00:54:50,166
Everyone kisses,
licking ears and all.

773
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:53,332
Good. So what's up?

774
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,791
There's good news
and less good news.

775
00:54:57,124 --> 00:54:59,541
- What about the good part?
- 116 lbs.

776
00:54:59,749 --> 00:55:00,999
- 116 lbs? That's really good.

777
00:55:01,249 --> 00:55:04,332
Unless she's three feet tall.

778
00:55:04,832 --> 00:55:06,416
On the other hand...

779
00:55:06,707 --> 00:55:07,999
she wants a picture.

780
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:10,749
- So?
- Come on.

781
00:55:10,999 --> 00:55:13,207
Good evening.
Can I see your tickets?

782
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:15,499
- Good evening.
- It's over here.

783
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:17,249
- Perfect.
- Have a good night.

784
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:19,916
- Good night to you.
- We'll be just here if you're looking for us...

785
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:22,916
We're not going to move.
Especially him.

786
00:55:24,332 --> 00:55:27,207
Wait...
What do you think women want?

787
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:28,416
I don't know.

788
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:31,499
A cute, charming, elegant man...

789
00:55:31,707 --> 00:55:35,416
No kidding. They want money.
Security.

790
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,582
Ask this dude.

791
00:55:39,499 --> 00:55:42,082
And you have all that.

792
00:55:42,582 --> 00:55:48,416
I might be naive, but I still hope I have
something more than my bank account..

793
00:55:48,707 --> 00:55:52,874
She spent 6 months reading your goddamn poems.
And she likes it.

794
00:55:53,124 --> 00:55:54,916
She's weird, don't worry.

795
00:55:55,124 --> 00:55:57,457
I'm sure she doesn't give
a damn about the chair.

796
00:55:57,624 --> 00:55:58,666
That's true.

797
00:55:59,749 --> 00:56:02,457
Plus guys from the north drink so much
they're all beating their ladies.

798
00:56:02,582 --> 00:56:03,749
She'll see there's
no risk with you.

799
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:05,374
Jerk.

800
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:09,374
That's good thinking
though, right?

801
00:56:10,624 --> 00:56:12,082
Yeah, whatever.

802
00:56:12,332 --> 00:56:13,582
The photo is a good test.

803
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:16,707
If she sends hers back
it's a good sign.

804
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:20,124
You can send a picture of you with
the chair, but not too obvious.

805
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:22,749
You don't have to send a
Telethon-like picture...

806
00:56:22,999 --> 00:56:25,124
Drooling and all...

807
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:27,374
Looking like shit.

808
00:56:27,624 --> 00:56:29,499
Alright, alright.

809
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,041
He has a problem.

810
00:56:44,207 --> 00:56:46,082
A big one.

811
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:48,124
Shush yourself.

812
00:56:51,457 --> 00:56:53,624
He's a tree...

813
00:56:53,874 --> 00:56:55,666
A singing tree.

814
00:57:02,124 --> 00:57:04,499
In german?

815
00:57:04,707 --> 00:57:06,166
Stop shushing me!

816
00:57:06,457 --> 00:57:08,499
It's in german anyway.

817
00:57:08,749 --> 00:57:10,749
As if it wasn't enough.

818
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,666
You're crazy.

819
00:57:12,957 --> 00:57:14,374
Oh man.

820
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:16,291
- How long does it last?
- Four hours.

821
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:17,749
Fuck.

822
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:24,374
You looked damn fine
in the old times.

823
00:57:25,249 --> 00:57:26,749
Which one?

824
00:57:28,957 --> 00:57:30,416
This one.

825
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,499
There's also this one...
I like it a lot.

826
00:57:36,707 --> 00:57:38,332
The chair is not obvious.

827
00:57:38,582 --> 00:57:42,374
But you can see something is going
on, and you look really good.

828
00:57:42,874 --> 00:57:45,291
- Are we doing this?
- I don't know.

829
00:57:45,874 --> 00:57:47,499
Didn't you have a
blast on the phone?

830
00:57:47,707 --> 00:57:48,541
I did.

831
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:49,832
Is that all?

832
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:52,374
- I had a fucking blast.
- So?

833
00:57:52,707 --> 00:57:55,082
So we're sending this
goddamn picture.

834
00:57:55,249 --> 00:57:59,457
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's do it!

835
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:05,082
Give me a cigarette.

836
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:07,291
Don't you ever knock?

837
00:58:07,457 --> 00:58:08,666
Are you painting?

838
00:58:08,832 --> 00:58:10,582
- Yes, get out!
- You're kidding me.

839
00:58:10,832 --> 00:58:13,291
Ha ha, painting.
Did you learn how to read as well?

840
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:15,291
I told you to get out of here!

841
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:18,707
Or what? You'll beat me?
Is that how women are treated in your country?

842
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:21,541
You're out of your mind.
Fuck off!

843
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:23,707
- I'll leave when I want.
- Right!

844
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:27,207
- See, I'm deciding to leave now.
- Leave!

845
00:58:27,499 --> 00:58:28,416
God damn it.

846
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:32,082
Replace this picture
with the other one.

847
00:58:33,082 --> 00:58:36,249
Please post it yourself,
and be discreet.

848
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:37,999
As you want.

849
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:41,832
Now throw the other
picture in the trash.

850
00:58:42,124 --> 00:58:43,416
I'm loosing it.

851
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:45,291
She's driving me crazy.

852
00:58:48,582 --> 00:58:51,207
- What's wrong?
- Your daughter is.

853
00:58:51,499 --> 00:58:54,249
- I was painting...
- You were... what?

854
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:56,749
Yes, whatever.
I wanted to tell you...

855
00:58:56,957 --> 00:58:59,291
She needs to cool it...
otherwise I will slap her.

856
00:58:59,499 --> 00:59:02,082
- Alright, cool it a little.
- No, I'm not cooling anything!

857
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:04,416
Am I not your arms
and your legs?

858
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,124
Yes.

859
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:09,166
Well I want to be your hands too.
So she can get what she deserves.

860
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:11,749
Since you can't really do anything
besides driving your chair over her.

861
00:59:11,957 --> 00:59:15,166
Driss, don't you think
you're exaggerating. Yvonne.

862
00:59:15,832 --> 00:59:16,999
Yvonne...

863
00:59:18,499 --> 00:59:19,457
Well...

864
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:23,207
She might need a
light admonition.

865
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:24,166
A light one?

866
00:59:24,499 --> 00:59:26,707
She's 16, dressing and painting
her face outrageously.

867
00:59:26,999 --> 00:59:29,374
She's also making out with the
annoying dude all over the house.

868
00:59:29,624 --> 00:59:32,707
But that's none of my business.
It's her education.

869
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:35,332
What I have a problem with is
how she despises everyone.

870
00:59:35,499 --> 00:59:39,082
How she talks to me. To you!

871
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:41,582
What are we? Slaves?

872
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:44,291
So if you let me, I'll give
her a lesson right now.

873
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:48,624
Alright, I get it.
Let me take care of it.

874
00:59:50,666 --> 00:59:52,624
Then take care of it. Fast.

875
00:59:53,207 --> 00:59:55,541
I'm gonna break something...

876
00:59:56,874 --> 00:59:59,166
He's painting?
What is he painting?

877
00:59:59,332 --> 01:00:00,874
I have no idea.

878
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:23,666
Get up, Philippe.

879
01:01:01,749 --> 01:01:03,041
Fits you like a charm.

880
01:01:03,374 --> 01:01:05,707
Right.

881
01:01:15,707 --> 01:01:20,791
You need to respect the people working for me.
It's unacceptable. Do you understand?

882
01:01:21,374 --> 01:01:22,916
I think she doesn't. Toughen up.

883
01:01:23,249 --> 01:01:25,874
By the way I don't want to
see this dude here any more.

884
01:01:26,124 --> 01:01:27,957
- God I get it! Leave me alone.
- I won't leave you alone.

885
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:31,832
Do I need to drive my chair
over you to make you obey me?

886
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:34,499
That's it. We're getting there.

887
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:40,457
- You did that?
- Yeah.

888
01:01:41,499 --> 01:01:42,749
I love it.

889
01:01:43,374 --> 01:01:46,374
I'm not saying I would
hang it at my place...

890
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:48,499
but it's...

891
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:52,749
How much do you think
we'll get from it?

892
01:01:53,749 --> 01:01:55,249
We'll see.

893
01:01:55,832 --> 01:01:58,874
We'll see more or less?

894
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:00,249
It's...

895
01:02:01,499 --> 01:02:03,082
- What the hell?
- What?

896
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:05,791
- I wasn't gonna use the tongue.
- You're retarded.

897
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:10,707
Can't you go faster?
I can't run in these conditions.

898
01:02:11,166 --> 01:02:15,124
- I'm at the maximum.
- The maximum... it's way too slow.

899
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:17,916
I can do 9 miles per hour.

900
01:02:19,874 --> 01:02:21,207
Is 9 miles/hour ok?

901
01:02:21,332 --> 01:02:23,498
Is it the best he can do?
Can't we get more?

902
01:02:23,499 --> 01:02:26,416
- It's the maximum.
- It'll do.

903
01:02:46,999 --> 01:02:48,249
Oh yeah...

904
01:02:57,416 --> 01:02:58,541
No, no.

905
01:02:58,832 --> 01:03:00,749
Stick to the ear.

906
01:03:01,249 --> 01:03:02,291
There.

907
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:21,041
- Bye.
- Bye.

908
01:03:21,374 --> 01:03:22,624
Hi Yvonne.

909
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,666
No he can't hear me.

910
01:03:25,874 --> 01:03:27,707
Yvonne, trust me.

911
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:29,124
Ok.

912
01:03:29,582 --> 01:03:31,832
We'll be home at 8:30.

913
01:03:32,124 --> 01:03:35,166
Yes, we'll be on time Yvonne.

914
01:03:35,874 --> 01:03:37,249
- What's up? She's freaking out?
- Yeah.

915
01:03:37,457 --> 01:03:39,332
It's your surprise
birthday again.

916
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,291
It's half an hour earlier.

917
01:03:41,499 --> 01:03:43,582
She's all stressed
out every year.

918
01:03:43,999 --> 01:03:48,832
She's inviting all my family, every
year it's exactly the same deal.

919
01:03:49,207 --> 01:03:52,791
They're mostly coming to
see if I'm still alive.

920
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:55,499
Just checking.

921
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:59,207
And I pretend to be surprised.

922
01:03:59,457 --> 01:04:01,207
Everyone's doing their best.

923
01:04:01,499 --> 01:04:05,374
But in the end we're
all really bored.

924
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:44,582
Sorry.

925
01:04:45,124 --> 01:04:46,332
Excuse me.

926
01:04:46,707 --> 01:04:47,749
Sorry.

927
01:04:48,124 --> 01:04:49,499
Sorry.

928
01:04:50,124 --> 01:04:51,499
Excuse me.

929
01:04:51,832 --> 01:04:54,166
Would you mind changing seats?
I called this one.

930
01:04:54,332 --> 01:04:56,166
I would mind indeed.

931
01:04:56,499 --> 01:04:58,332
- Oh believe me you'll do it.

932
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:02,082
Come on! Just shift to the left.

933
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:03,666
There.

934
01:05:04,249 --> 01:05:05,666
Very nice of you.

935
01:05:17,332 --> 01:05:19,499
The suit makes you
look like another man.

936
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,457
It looks good.

937
01:05:23,707 --> 01:05:26,499
You look like Barack Obama.

938
01:05:26,624 --> 01:05:27,791
Really?

939
01:05:30,832 --> 01:05:32,082
She has the hots for me.

940
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:36,082
Barack Obama. How cool is that.

941
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:42,374
It's a bit like someone called you...
Mitt Romney for instance.

942
01:05:42,499 --> 01:05:44,082
Raffarin.

943
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:46,999
Or George Bush.

944
01:05:55,749 --> 01:05:58,124
What are you doing?
You're gonna miss the concert.

945
01:05:58,332 --> 01:05:59,999
Leave me alone.

946
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:03,374
- Are you menstruating or what?
- Get out.

947
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:04,832
- What's up?

948
01:06:06,124 --> 01:06:07,249
Elisa.

949
01:06:07,374 --> 01:06:08,624
Elisa.

950
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:11,207
- Leave me alone, goddammit.
- What did you take?

951
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:13,832
What did you do?

952
01:06:16,957 --> 01:06:19,666
- Where did you find this?
- In Yvonne's purse.

953
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:21,041
Imodium?

954
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:23,124
What was your plan?

955
01:06:23,457 --> 01:06:25,249
Suicide?

956
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:29,957
- You're just gonna stop pooping for 3 months.
- Leave me alone!

957
01:06:30,499 --> 01:06:32,207
Wait... you took Ibuprofen too?

958
01:06:32,499 --> 01:06:34,666
You're gonna die!
It's dangerous!

959
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:39,166
What should we do? Call 911?

960
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:40,874
Why would you do that?

961
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:43,374
It's Bastien.

962
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:45,416
- What about him?
- He dumped me.

963
01:06:45,749 --> 01:06:49,207
He doesn't care about me.
He called me a slut.

964
01:06:49,624 --> 01:06:50,707
That's not ok at all.

965
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:53,457
Nobody would care
if I died anyway.

966
01:06:53,749 --> 01:06:55,666
Bullshit! Stop saying that.
Let's join the party.

967
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:56,707
Can't you go see him?

968
01:06:57,457 --> 01:06:58,791
Talk to him?

969
01:06:58,999 --> 01:07:01,832
- To who?
- Bastien. I'll pay you.

970
01:07:02,124 --> 01:07:04,166
What do you mean you'll pay me?
You've really lost it!

971
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:06,666
Do you think I have time to deal
with children's' heartaches?

972
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:08,874
- Please.
- Talk to Bastien?

973
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:10,291
Paying me?

974
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:13,874
Who do you think
you're talking to?

975
01:07:14,707 --> 01:07:16,791
Please, Driss.

976
01:07:17,207 --> 01:07:19,874
How much?

977
01:07:20,624 --> 01:07:22,041
You're silly.

978
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:28,249
Well, there's something.
There's a particular touch to it.

979
01:07:28,624 --> 01:07:33,791
But I mean... 11000€ for an
unknown artist seems like a lot.

980
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:35,416
Hmm...

981
01:07:36,082 --> 01:07:40,541
On the other hand, if I don't buy it it's
going to be worth the triple in a year...

982
01:07:40,832 --> 01:07:42,666
And you'll tell
me: "I told you".

983
01:07:42,957 --> 01:07:43,832
Am I right?

984
01:07:44,082 --> 01:07:45,041
Hmm.

985
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:49,291
- You told me he has a gallery in London?
- Berlin.

986
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:50,874
Berlin?

987
01:07:51,999 --> 01:07:53,416
Well that's...

988
01:07:54,082 --> 01:07:56,374
I don't know...

989
01:07:57,374 --> 01:08:00,791
11000€ is a lot.

990
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:05,291
Come on, give me something.
Does she have someone?

991
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,124
Yes. Fred.

992
01:08:07,457 --> 01:08:08,916
What about Fred?

993
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:10,999
They've been together
for two years.

994
01:08:11,916 --> 01:08:15,832
But it's an on and off thing...
There's a lot of tension.

995
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:19,291
Right now...
I know it's not going that well.

996
01:08:19,874 --> 01:08:21,582
- Maybe because of me.
- Yup.

997
01:08:21,874 --> 01:08:24,207
- Did she say something about me?
- No.

998
01:08:24,707 --> 01:08:25,707
Alright, of course she did.

999
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:27,249
A little bit.

1000
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:31,457
Yes! I knew it!
She's got the hots for me.

1001
01:08:33,082 --> 01:08:34,207
What, you're spoofing me?

1002
01:08:34,374 --> 01:08:36,582
- No.
- Laugh as much as you want.

1003
01:08:36,749 --> 01:08:38,666
One day Magalie
will be in my bed.

1004
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:41,207
Hope well and have well.

1005
01:08:41,791 --> 01:08:44,999
Careful with the appetisers,
given your stomach issues...

1006
01:08:45,249 --> 01:08:50,582
I'm not a doctor, but I know if you
take Imodium, something's wrong.

1007
01:08:59,624 --> 01:09:01,499
Pardon me. Please...

1008
01:09:01,832 --> 01:09:03,624
Can I ask you a favour?

1009
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:05,791
A little piece for me?

1010
01:09:06,749 --> 01:09:08,291
No, Philippe! We were chilling.

1011
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:09,749
Yes.

1012
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:13,666
Vivaldi, the Fours Seasons.

1013
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:17,499
You'll see, you'll like it.

1014
01:09:32,832 --> 01:09:35,666
What about that?
Don't tell me you don't feel anything.

1015
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:37,082
Nope. Nothing.

1016
01:09:38,082 --> 01:09:39,457
Not at all.

1017
01:09:39,707 --> 01:09:42,499
For me, it's not music if
you can't dance to it.

1018
01:09:42,582 --> 01:09:46,207
Let's try something else.

1019
01:09:50,332 --> 01:09:52,249
Yeah. I know this one.

1020
01:09:52,624 --> 01:09:54,582
It's a commercial!

1021
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:56,666
For coffee, right?

1022
01:10:01,457 --> 01:10:03,832
I shall leave thee now.

1023
01:10:04,124 --> 01:10:06,416
I am expected by the
king at the castle.

1024
01:10:06,832 --> 01:10:09,082
I'm taking the minstrels there.

1025
01:10:09,249 --> 01:10:10,416
Let's go.

1026
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:13,791
I'm a brave and good knight.

1027
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:16,124
Wow, that's creepy...

1028
01:10:16,374 --> 01:10:19,374
It's about naked dudes...

1029
01:10:20,374 --> 01:10:24,041
They're running naked
in the fields.

1030
01:10:24,332 --> 01:10:25,999
And giggling...

1031
01:10:26,999 --> 01:10:27,832
Alright, alright...

1032
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:29,874
Bach was badass.

1033
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:32,041
I'm sure he got all the
chicks with his music.

1034
01:10:32,249 --> 01:10:35,166
It's the 18th century's
Barry White.

1035
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:36,874
Oh I know this one.

1036
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:39,624
Everyone know it.

1037
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:41,249
Of course.

1038
01:10:41,582 --> 01:10:44,291
"You have reached the Paris
unemployment agency."

1039
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:46,791
"All our lines are
currently busy."

1040
01:10:46,957 --> 01:10:49,916
"The estimated waiting
time is: two years."

1041
01:10:57,207 --> 01:11:00,041
Isn't it Tom and Jerry?

1042
01:11:06,457 --> 01:11:08,166
Tom and Jerry...

1043
01:11:08,374 --> 01:11:09,874
What a jerk.

1044
01:11:10,082 --> 01:11:11,207
Help!

1045
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:12,624
Help!

1046
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:17,916
Now it's my turn. We listened to
your classics, let's listen to mine.

1047
01:11:18,082 --> 01:11:21,749
"Earth, Wind & Fire".
I told you about them. So good!

1048
01:11:25,374 --> 01:11:26,457
It's something else.

1049
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:28,207
That's something else for sure.

1050
01:11:28,457 --> 01:11:29,749
Am I right?

1051
01:11:32,082 --> 01:11:33,207
Driss.

1052
01:11:33,499 --> 01:11:35,874
- Driss.
- I can't hear you.

1053
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:11,582
Come on, dance for
Philippe's birthday.

1054
01:12:12,124 --> 01:12:15,499
Come on. For Philippe.

1055
01:13:00,832 --> 01:13:01,957
There.

1056
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:08,832
So...

1057
01:13:10,207 --> 01:13:12,499
With all that I didn't
give you my present,

1058
01:13:12,707 --> 01:13:13,999
it arrived this morning.

1059
01:13:14,332 --> 01:13:17,041
I didn't want to ruin the party,
if she was ugly or something.

1060
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:20,249
You never know.
But at least she responded.

1061
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:22,832
Well... Good night!

1062
01:13:23,874 --> 01:13:27,207
Alright, I'll open it...

1063
01:13:29,582 --> 01:13:30,791
So?

1064
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:35,374
She does not look like a dog.
Not at all.

1065
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:37,582
Oh damn...

1066
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,582
It must be the only northern
girl with all her teeth.

1067
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:41,874
There's a note with it.

1068
01:13:42,082 --> 01:13:48,041
'I'm coming to Paris next week.
I'm waiting for your call.' 'Dot dot dot.'

1069
01:13:48,874 --> 01:13:50,332
You know what 'Dot dot
dot' means, right?

1070
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:52,499
What does it mean?

1071
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:55,374
- That's good?
- Of course it's good, she wants you.

1072
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:57,916
One dot, two dots, three dots,
she wants you, end of the story.

1073
01:13:58,166 --> 01:14:02,332
- She wants me...

1074
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:03,832
Feels good, doesn't it?

1075
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:06,957
- I'm too excited to sleep.
- But you will.

1076
01:14:07,832 --> 01:14:09,416
I'm putting the picture here.

1077
01:14:10,332 --> 01:14:12,041
She's watching you sleep.

1078
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:13,457
There.

1079
01:14:13,832 --> 01:14:15,707
Good night, Philippe.

1080
01:14:15,957 --> 01:14:18,624
Sweet dreams.

1081
01:14:29,624 --> 01:14:32,582
Let's try the hat again.

1082
01:14:34,082 --> 01:14:36,124
- Not bad.
- No.

1083
01:14:36,249 --> 01:14:38,416
No. He looks like a
chimney sweeper.

1084
01:14:38,749 --> 01:14:39,957
He can't be dressed too classic.

1085
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:42,374
- What did I just say?
- Ok, so it's too classic.

1086
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:46,582
- Forget the hat.

1087
01:14:47,499 --> 01:14:49,624
Regular or fancy?

1088
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:51,332
There's something.

1089
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:52,999
It works.

1090
01:14:53,207 --> 01:14:55,082
- What about this?
- Stop laughing.

1091
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:57,916
- Let's go horse-riding...
- Come on.

1092
01:14:58,207 --> 01:15:01,082
Yvonne will take me there.
I'll go alone.

1093
01:15:01,332 --> 01:15:03,916
- Really?
- It's ok.

1094
01:15:04,457 --> 01:15:06,624
Yes. I'll manage.

1095
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:08,749
Alright.

1096
01:15:12,582 --> 01:15:14,332
I think I'm freaking
out a little.

1097
01:15:14,749 --> 01:15:17,666
Don't worry, none can tell.

1098
01:15:19,624 --> 01:15:21,666
4... a... x... c - b square

1099
01:15:21,957 --> 01:15:22,999
- b square?

1100
01:15:23,166 --> 01:15:25,291
I found 20, not b squ...

1101
01:15:25,457 --> 01:15:26,291
Hey.

1102
01:15:26,957 --> 01:15:29,332
Go take a walk, funny hair.

1103
01:15:29,499 --> 01:15:31,749
- So Bastien... You remember me?
- Yeah.

1104
01:15:31,999 --> 01:15:32,999
- Oh yeah?
- What's wrong?

1105
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:35,332
I heard what you told Elisa.
It's not very nice.

1106
01:15:35,499 --> 01:15:36,832
- I didn't say anything...
- Shut up.

1107
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:39,332
Now you'll act like a
man and apologise.

1108
01:15:39,541 --> 01:15:41,749
- I'm sorry, man.
- Hands off me.

1109
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:44,166
- Not to me, to her!
- Ok, to her.

1110
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:46,666
And you'll bring her
croissants every morning.

1111
01:15:46,874 --> 01:15:48,291
- Plain or with butter?
- What?

1112
01:15:48,457 --> 01:15:51,124
- Plain or with butter?
- Whatever. I don't care.

1113
01:15:51,291 --> 01:15:52,749
Do as you want, but do it right.

1114
01:15:52,957 --> 01:15:54,749
- You be nice.
- Yes. I'll be very nice.

1115
01:15:54,957 --> 01:15:56,916
Now move. Move!

1116
01:15:57,541 --> 01:16:00,832
And take care of your hair.
Put a hair clip or something.

1117
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:04,582
What time is it?

1118
01:16:06,249 --> 01:16:07,416
4:45

1119
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:17,666
Should I loose the hat?

1120
01:16:18,457 --> 01:16:20,499
Yeah. That's better.

1121
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:30,166
What time is it?

1122
01:16:30,374 --> 01:16:33,999
46 - 47.
It's not changing that fast.

1123
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:36,749
I'd like a whisky.

1124
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:38,207
Yeah.

1125
01:16:41,582 --> 01:16:43,041
Please.

1126
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:17,666
One more.

1127
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:19,874
I don't if it's a good idea...

1128
01:17:20,124 --> 01:17:21,582
Make it a double.

1129
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:27,082
Sir, a double whisky please.

1130
01:17:56,916 --> 01:17:58,624
- Hello.
- Hello, Driss.

1131
01:17:58,916 --> 01:18:00,582
What are you doing now?
Are you busy?

1132
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:02,749
I'm working out. How's it going?

1133
01:18:02,957 --> 01:18:05,332
Don't you want to get away?

1134
01:18:05,832 --> 01:18:07,457
No questions?

1135
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:08,957
No. No questions.

1136
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:11,791
- You want to leave?
- Yes.

1137
01:18:12,957 --> 01:18:14,082
Where are we going?

1138
01:18:14,916 --> 01:18:16,791
Get some fresh air.

1139
01:18:17,207 --> 01:18:19,166
Get some fresh air.

1140
01:18:20,332 --> 01:18:22,582
I'll be there after a shower.

1141
01:18:24,832 --> 01:18:26,416
We're going. Take the hat.

1142
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:29,791
- But ti's barely 6.
- We're going.

1143
01:19:06,624 --> 01:19:08,832
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1144
01:19:15,082 --> 01:19:18,707
Give him so champagne too.
It'll help him relax.

1145
01:19:18,874 --> 01:19:21,832
- I'm not stressed out.
- Really? - No.

1146
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:40,707
It's only us?

1147
01:19:41,874 --> 01:19:45,291
The other people didn't come?
It's just us.

1148
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,749
Ok, I'm a little nervous.

1149
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:08,249
Why?

1150
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:10,374
I don't know.

1151
01:20:11,582 --> 01:20:14,124
We both know you're not
the luckiest person.

1152
01:20:14,416 --> 01:20:15,749
The accident...

1153
01:20:15,874 --> 01:20:17,999
The chair... Your wife.

1154
01:20:18,374 --> 01:20:21,291
It's Kennedy-like scary.

1155
01:20:22,499 --> 01:20:24,249
- Miss.
- Yes?

1156
01:20:24,457 --> 01:20:27,041
Can you give him the package?

1157
01:20:27,374 --> 01:20:28,791
Thank you.

1158
01:20:33,082 --> 01:20:34,582
Thank you.

1159
01:20:35,332 --> 01:20:36,749
Why?

1160
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:46,249
What's that?

1161
01:20:46,416 --> 01:20:50,791
That's what you're worth in the art business.
I got 11000€ for your painting.

1162
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:53,999
You shouldn't stop, you have a hell of a talent.
- Yup.

1163
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:56,541
That's a good deal. I knew it.

1164
01:20:56,666 --> 01:20:59,291
I felt it. It was instinct.

1165
01:20:59,582 --> 01:21:03,499
With the music and all...
It all blended...

1166
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:07,541
And then, an epiphany!
I saw a light.

1167
01:21:07,749 --> 01:21:09,124
Ok, stay humble will you?

1168
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:11,749
11000€, though, can
you believe it?

1169
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:14,457
What was that?

1170
01:21:14,707 --> 01:21:18,082
Nothing.
Just a hole in the cabin.

1171
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,874
Philippe, tell me if
something's wrong.

1172
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:22,541
It was very nice knowing you.

1173
01:21:22,749 --> 01:21:24,916
No Philippe, I don't like these jokes.
Really.

1174
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:29,166
You're used to drama,
but I'm not.

1175
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,749
You have to be really
insane to do that.

1176
01:22:02,999 --> 01:22:04,166
A little bit.

1177
01:22:09,999 --> 01:22:12,082
I'll tell you
something, Philippe.

1178
01:22:12,332 --> 01:22:16,791
- You're a maniac.
- Really? I didn't know that.

1179
01:22:18,374 --> 01:22:21,541
- Now you get Driss ready.
- Sure.

1180
01:22:21,832 --> 01:22:24,249
Right. In your dreams.
I'm not doing any of this.

1181
01:22:25,082 --> 01:22:26,124
I'll be waiting for
you over there.

1182
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:28,291
I'll take pictures...
'Get Driss ready...'

1183
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:31,416
How are you gonna take pictures?

1184
01:22:31,791 --> 01:22:35,124
Laugh all you want.
I'm not doing this.

1185
01:22:47,957 --> 01:22:50,041
- I don't want to any more.
- Wait.

1186
01:22:50,374 --> 01:22:51,999
- Take it off.
- Wait, wait.

1187
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:54,374
I don't have to anyway, right?

1188
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:04,416
Wait, what's going on?

1189
01:23:04,624 --> 01:23:05,582
Is something wrong?

1190
01:23:05,832 --> 01:23:07,291
Oh man.

1191
01:23:08,999 --> 01:23:10,166
Fuck.

1192
01:23:10,416 --> 01:23:12,624
Why is it going higher?

1193
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,457
What's going on?

1194
01:23:25,749 --> 01:23:26,707
Oh my god.

1195
01:23:26,874 --> 01:23:27,999
Hey, Driss!

1196
01:23:29,416 --> 01:23:31,582
Relax, for god's sake.

1197
01:23:31,999 --> 01:23:34,082
I'm relaxed, can't
we get down now?

1198
01:23:34,374 --> 01:23:36,249
I've seen it, it's cool.
I'm done.

1199
01:23:40,124 --> 01:23:41,541
What the hell!

1200
01:23:44,582 --> 01:23:47,041
What is happening now?

1201
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:54,166
Come on, Driss.

1202
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:21,999
Listen to this.

1203
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:24,082
Where can you find
a tetraplegic?

1204
01:24:24,332 --> 01:24:26,666
Where can you... I don't know.

1205
01:24:26,957 --> 01:24:29,624
Where you left him.

1206
01:24:29,999 --> 01:24:32,457
Awful.

1207
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:34,832
You're awful.

1208
01:24:36,707 --> 01:24:39,832
Driss, someone's here for you.

1209
01:24:41,582 --> 01:24:42,957
What are you doing here?

1210
01:24:43,499 --> 01:24:45,082
Why did you hide this?

1211
01:24:45,249 --> 01:24:47,666
- You answer the question.
- How did you find me?

1212
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:50,874
The unemployment agency sent this.
It mentions the address.

1213
01:24:51,832 --> 01:24:53,749
- And what's that?
- Nothing. Let it go.

1214
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:55,999
- What did you do?
- I fell from my scooter.

1215
01:24:56,207 --> 01:24:57,666
- From your scooter?
- Yeah.

1216
01:24:57,874 --> 01:25:00,332
Bullshit. Get up.

1217
01:25:00,832 --> 01:25:03,041
This way.

1218
01:25:06,416 --> 01:25:07,999
Damn.

1219
01:25:11,707 --> 01:25:13,041
That's your room?

1220
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:15,999
- Tell me what happened.
- Nothing.

1221
01:25:16,332 --> 01:25:19,166
- Tell me.
- It's none of your business.

1222
01:25:19,332 --> 01:25:22,082
How is it not my business?
You're hiding here but it's none of my business?

1223
01:25:22,249 --> 01:25:24,666
We were only four and they screwed us.
But don't worry, they're gonna pay.

1224
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:26,916
You're not gonna make anyone "pay".
Does mom know?

1225
01:25:27,124 --> 01:25:27,791
No.

1226
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:30,041
- Don't worry, I have it covered.
- You have nothing covered.

1227
01:25:30,207 --> 01:25:31,832
- You're a pain in the ass.
- Right.

1228
01:25:31,999 --> 01:25:34,332
Now you stay here and you
don't touch anything.

1229
01:25:34,499 --> 01:25:37,374
- Can I lie down?
- You don't touch anything!

1230
01:25:37,582 --> 01:25:39,166
Alright, I got it.

1231
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:41,541
Moron...

1232
01:25:45,207 --> 01:25:47,082
I'm telling you, he's with me.

1233
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:48,707
Stop crying Nina.

1234
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:51,666
He's not wounded,
it's just a scratch.

1235
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:52,749
He's fine.

1236
01:25:52,957 --> 01:25:56,916
Calm down, Nina.
Nobody's killing anybody.

1237
01:25:57,166 --> 01:25:58,332
It's only words.

1238
01:25:58,666 --> 01:26:01,666
Meanwhile I can't take care of him.
I'm working.

1239
01:26:01,916 --> 01:26:04,332
No, don't tell her.

1240
01:26:04,499 --> 01:26:08,166
You go crying in your room if you want,
but you don't tell her anything.

1241
01:26:16,249 --> 01:26:17,749
I think it's time for bed.

1242
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:20,457
I'm gonna stay up for a bit.

1243
01:26:21,124 --> 01:26:22,582
Sit down.

1244
01:26:24,332 --> 01:26:26,249
Sit down here.

1245
01:26:34,457 --> 01:26:37,374
What do you think of that woman?

1246
01:26:37,957 --> 01:26:41,082
- She looks hot.
- What else?

1247
01:26:42,249 --> 01:26:44,499
Can we go upstairs now...
I have something to deal with...

1248
01:26:44,791 --> 01:26:46,666
I imagine her getting up...

1249
01:26:46,957 --> 01:26:48,582
and turning around...

1250
01:26:48,874 --> 01:26:52,166
so that I can finally
see her face.

1251
01:26:54,707 --> 01:26:56,416
The boy looks like you.

1252
01:26:56,624 --> 01:26:59,249
- Adama?
- Yes.

1253
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:01,124
I saw him earlier.

1254
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,291
I think if I had crossed
him in the street,

1255
01:27:03,624 --> 01:27:06,291
I could have told he
was your brother.

1256
01:27:06,499 --> 01:27:07,707
That's weird.

1257
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:09,791
Why?

1258
01:27:10,249 --> 01:27:12,874
Because he's not my brother.

1259
01:27:13,207 --> 01:27:14,374
Really?

1260
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:16,916
It's complicated.

1261
01:27:18,082 --> 01:27:21,374
Is he your brother or not?

1262
01:27:25,541 --> 01:27:27,457
Ok. I get it.

1263
01:27:28,749 --> 01:27:30,541
Let's go.

1264
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:39,957
My parents...

1265
01:27:40,749 --> 01:27:43,166
they're not really my parents.

1266
01:27:43,332 --> 01:27:45,666
They're my uncle and my aunt.

1267
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:49,499
They came to get me in
Senegal when I was 8.

1268
01:27:49,832 --> 01:27:53,374
They couldn't have children, so they went
to see a brother who had a load of them.

1269
01:27:53,707 --> 01:27:55,874
They took the elder.

1270
01:27:56,332 --> 01:27:57,874
Me.

1271
01:28:00,249 --> 01:28:01,999
I was called Bakary.

1272
01:28:02,124 --> 01:28:05,166
That's my real name.

1273
01:28:05,457 --> 01:28:07,666
But there were several Bakarys in the
neighbourhood so they called me Idriss...

1274
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:10,707
somehow it turned into Driss.

1275
01:28:11,457 --> 01:28:12,332
Then what?

1276
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:16,207
Then out of nowhere my mother...
I mean my aunt...

1277
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:19,374
she got pregnant twice.

1278
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,041
Then my uncle died.

1279
01:28:21,374 --> 01:28:23,124
And then there were other
guys, other children.

1280
01:28:23,457 --> 01:28:26,082
I told you it's complicated.

1281
01:28:26,957 --> 01:28:32,166
About Adama. Don't you think
he needs a light admonition?

1282
01:28:39,249 --> 01:28:42,666
He came to get you, didn't he?

1283
01:28:45,291 --> 01:28:46,416
Driss.

1284
01:28:49,874 --> 01:28:51,624
I think it's the
end of the road.

1285
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:56,374
You weren't going to push a disabled's
chair your whole life anyway.

1286
01:28:56,666 --> 01:29:02,582
And since you worked well,
you'll get unemployment again.

1287
01:29:05,624 --> 01:29:06,874
Enough.

1288
01:29:07,082 --> 01:29:08,332
Let's go.

1289
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:09,957
Come on.

1290
01:29:10,332 --> 01:29:11,499
Yeah.

1291
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:17,874
Vassary Bakary. Bakary Vassary.

1292
01:29:18,124 --> 01:29:19,041
It's beautiful.

1293
01:29:19,457 --> 01:29:20,916
Very poetic.

1294
01:29:21,332 --> 01:29:23,249
It has an alliteration.

1295
01:29:23,457 --> 01:29:26,791
- Do you know what an alliteration is?
- No.

1296
01:29:29,332 --> 01:29:31,957
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Bastien. Thank you.

1297
01:29:32,249 --> 01:29:35,749
Oh we're having a brunch tomorrow.
Could you bring something more...

1298
01:29:35,957 --> 01:29:36,916
Of course.

1299
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:39,207
- Goodbye Yvonne.
- You didn't forget my little treats, did you?

1300
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:40,249
No.

1301
01:29:40,582 --> 01:29:42,541
- Good, thanks.
- Say hello to Elisa.

1302
01:29:42,916 --> 01:29:43,791
See you tomorrow.

1303
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:47,166
Bastien, my friend. What's up?

1304
01:29:53,832 --> 01:29:55,082
So it's true.

1305
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:56,791
- You're leaving.
- Yeah.

1306
01:29:57,082 --> 01:30:00,666
Don't worry, I have your number.
I'll call you very soon.

1307
01:30:01,499 --> 01:30:04,707
- I know it's gonna be tough for you. Be strong.
- It's a shame.

1308
01:30:04,916 --> 01:30:08,457
You know I'm getting your room?
There's a water issue in mine.

1309
01:30:08,707 --> 01:30:10,582
I might stay, in the end.

1310
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:13,374
We'd have to get warm
in the bed together.

1311
01:30:13,791 --> 01:30:17,291
It would be a little too small.
I'm not alone.

1312
01:30:17,666 --> 01:30:18,791
Here she is.

1313
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:22,957
- This is Frederique.
- Hello.

1314
01:30:24,624 --> 01:30:25,791
Hi.

1315
01:30:30,082 --> 01:30:31,207
I get it...

1316
01:30:31,499 --> 01:30:34,124
- What?
- I understand, it's your...

1317
01:30:34,582 --> 01:30:36,666
So that's why...

1318
01:30:36,916 --> 01:30:38,499
Yes.

1319
01:30:39,749 --> 01:30:40,749
Well.

1320
01:30:41,291 --> 01:30:44,832
I'm not giving you a kiss, then.

1321
01:30:49,082 --> 01:30:52,082
I would be up for a
threesome you know.

1322
01:30:53,957 --> 01:30:56,041
Well... I'm down.

1323
01:30:56,291 --> 01:31:00,249
Not now though, I have to leave.
But I can come back.

1324
01:31:00,874 --> 01:31:04,374
- I have stuff to do, but I'll be back.
- I'm joking.

1325
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:09,082
Alright...

1326
01:31:09,332 --> 01:31:11,749
See you, dudes.

1327
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:16,582
Mr Michel Saloudy.

1328
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:24,457
Keep it on all the time!

1329
01:31:24,749 --> 01:31:26,332
Are you mad about Magalie?

1330
01:31:26,541 --> 01:31:28,416
No. Nice one.

1331
01:31:28,874 --> 01:31:29,999
Nice one, but...

1332
01:31:31,999 --> 01:31:36,249
it did seem weird that she would resist.
It never happened to me.

1333
01:31:38,291 --> 01:31:40,249
Kiss?

1334
01:31:41,374 --> 01:31:43,041
Yes. Sure.

1335
01:31:45,707 --> 01:31:47,624
Yvonne.

1336
01:31:48,916 --> 01:31:51,207
You're good...

1337
01:31:51,499 --> 01:31:52,999
See you.

1338
01:31:53,291 --> 01:31:55,124
Yvonne.

1339
01:31:56,707 --> 01:31:58,124
Wait.

1340
01:32:03,874 --> 01:32:07,499
We won't need that any more.

1341
01:32:08,499 --> 01:32:10,332
Bye.

1342
01:32:13,749 --> 01:32:15,499
Watch your foot.

1343
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:17,124
Let's go.

1344
01:32:32,416 --> 01:32:33,582
Wait.

1345
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:36,791
What's your bank?

1346
01:32:37,749 --> 01:32:38,499
Ok.

1347
01:32:38,707 --> 01:32:39,832
Excuse me.

1348
01:32:40,082 --> 01:32:43,624
Could you please move your car?
You can't park here.

1349
01:32:43,916 --> 01:32:44,957
It's written over there.

1350
01:32:45,416 --> 01:32:46,624
- I'm moving.
- Thanks.

1351
01:32:46,832 --> 01:32:48,749
I'll call you back.

1352
01:32:51,416 --> 01:32:54,249
Why do you mind?
We're not even driving.

1353
01:32:54,541 --> 01:32:56,707
It's a matter of principles.

1354
01:32:58,207 --> 01:32:59,332
Go on.

1355
01:32:59,916 --> 01:33:02,582
Wait for me over there.

1356
01:33:13,957 --> 01:33:15,457
What are you doing?

1357
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,916
I'm coming.

1358
01:34:55,582 --> 01:34:57,957
I can cancel my date you know.

1359
01:34:58,082 --> 01:34:59,874
Of course not.
Why would you do that?

1360
01:35:00,041 --> 01:35:02,541
Have a good tim.
Everything's fine.

1361
01:35:03,624 --> 01:35:05,707
Yvonne? I'm ready.

1362
01:35:05,999 --> 01:35:07,791
Good. I'll be here in a minute.

1363
01:35:08,207 --> 01:35:09,707
Well, everything's ready.

1364
01:35:10,082 --> 01:35:11,666
You just have to serve.

1365
01:35:11,791 --> 01:35:16,041
Call me if anything's wrong.

1366
01:35:19,124 --> 01:35:21,832
- Call me, ok?
- Yeah.

1367
01:35:23,624 --> 01:35:26,957
So if you're ready, I'm
gonna serve your meal.

1368
01:35:27,332 --> 01:35:31,666
Take these scrubs off.
I feel like in an asylum.

1369
01:35:31,957 --> 01:35:34,707
- Alright.
- Do you have a cigarette?

1370
01:35:35,124 --> 01:35:37,957
No. I don't smoke. Not any more.

1371
01:35:38,749 --> 01:35:42,082
To be honest I gave
up recently...

1372
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:43,791
and you should do the same.

1373
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:47,207
Even if you're not
exercising or something...

1374
01:35:47,416 --> 01:35:51,082
it's better for your
lungs, your breath.

1375
01:35:53,374 --> 01:35:55,291
You're not going to eat.

1376
01:36:57,166 --> 01:36:58,666
What the hell!

1377
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:00,707
Come on. Be careful.

1378
01:37:00,957 --> 01:37:02,749
I'm sorry.

1379
01:37:03,082 --> 01:37:04,499
- Good morning, sir.
- What?

1380
01:37:04,749 --> 01:37:07,582
It's the person you asked for...

1381
01:37:07,874 --> 01:37:10,332
For the head massage.
It's Mr Jacquet.

1382
01:37:10,541 --> 01:37:11,666
Good morning.

1383
01:37:12,082 --> 01:37:13,082
Get out!

1384
01:37:13,374 --> 01:37:14,791
Leave me alone.

1385
01:37:15,041 --> 01:37:15,999
Leave!

1386
01:37:16,249 --> 01:37:18,582
- Is it my fault?
- No, non.

1387
01:37:19,082 --> 01:37:21,499
He got up on the wrong
side of the bed.

1388
01:37:23,749 --> 01:37:25,916
"Got up on"... Idiot.

1389
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:27,749
Moron.

1390
01:37:29,249 --> 01:37:30,332
Driss Vassary?

1391
01:37:30,499 --> 01:37:32,749
- Yes.
- It's your turn.

1392
01:37:47,124 --> 01:37:49,624
You've only had your driving
license for a month.

1393
01:37:49,832 --> 01:37:52,082
Yes, but I've been
driving for longer.

1394
01:37:52,332 --> 01:37:55,499
I mean I drove in private
ways, out of the roads.

1395
01:37:55,874 --> 01:37:57,666
Parking lots...

1396
01:37:58,207 --> 01:38:00,082
I'm a good driver.

1397
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:03,832
I read your file.

1398
01:38:04,457 --> 01:38:08,791
In your personal evaluation you
only wrote one word: pragmatic.

1399
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:10,082
Yes.

1400
01:38:10,666 --> 01:38:11,832
It is important.

1401
01:38:12,082 --> 01:38:15,749
You forgot to mention another
important aspect in our company.

1402
01:38:16,041 --> 01:38:16,999
Did I?

1403
01:38:18,166 --> 01:38:20,832
You could just take the time
to read the poster line.

1404
01:38:21,041 --> 01:38:23,082
- Hey, that's a
twelve feet rhyme.

1405
01:38:23,332 --> 01:38:24,249
Sorry?

1406
01:38:24,499 --> 01:38:29,041
You-could-just-take-the-time
To-read-the-pos-ter-line

1407
01:38:29,416 --> 01:38:30,916
12 feet.

1408
01:38:31,332 --> 01:38:34,582
- That wasn't on purpose.
- Your catchphrase is "Just in time".

1409
01:38:34,916 --> 01:38:37,582
Oh that's why you put
Dali's watches..

1410
01:38:37,874 --> 01:38:39,791
A little artistic touch.

1411
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:42,041
Maybe...

1412
01:38:43,291 --> 01:38:46,082
- You like paintings?
- I do.

1413
01:38:46,499 --> 01:38:48,541
- I like Goya.
- She's alright...

1414
01:38:48,666 --> 01:38:53,332
...didn't sing much
since Pandi-Panda.

1415
01:39:00,166 --> 01:39:01,416
Yes.

1416
01:39:03,207 --> 01:39:04,249
I'm coming.

1417
01:39:05,499 --> 01:39:07,332
I'm on my way.

1418
01:39:11,082 --> 01:39:12,957
- Are you ok?
- Yes.

1419
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:15,166
Leave me alone.

1420
01:39:15,499 --> 01:39:18,832
Do you need water? A wet towel?

1421
01:39:20,207 --> 01:39:21,666
Get out.

1422
01:39:22,207 --> 01:39:25,291
- I mean I can...
- Leave me alone.

1423
01:39:32,374 --> 01:39:33,291
There.

1424
01:39:33,499 --> 01:39:35,249
- Thanks, dude.
- You're welcome.

1425
01:39:35,457 --> 01:39:38,124
- Have a nice week-end.
- You too.

1426
01:39:38,416 --> 01:39:41,624
- What's going on?
- He's not doing well.

1427
01:39:41,874 --> 01:39:44,166
- Where is he now?
- He was in the garden earlier.

1428
01:39:44,582 --> 01:39:45,791
Ok.

1429
01:39:59,166 --> 01:40:00,332
So...

1430
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:02,416
What's going on?

1431
01:40:02,707 --> 01:40:05,082
What's the deal with the beard?

1432
01:40:06,207 --> 01:40:07,457
Freud?

1433
01:40:07,707 --> 01:40:10,249
Abraham Lincoln?
An old dude, anyway.

1434
01:40:10,707 --> 01:40:11,916
Victor Hugo.

1435
01:40:13,082 --> 01:40:15,082
You need a good shaving.
Take care of yourself.

1436
01:40:15,374 --> 01:40:16,791
It was time I came back.

1437
01:40:17,082 --> 01:40:18,791
I'll be here in a minute.

1438
01:41:12,249 --> 01:41:13,999
Now what?

1439
01:41:14,666 --> 01:41:17,416
Now you let me decide.

1440
01:43:01,207 --> 01:43:04,124
Don't you like that?

1441
01:43:25,082 --> 01:43:27,707
A sharp fast cut
would relieve me.

1442
01:43:28,999 --> 01:43:31,666
It's good to see
you're doing better.

1443
01:43:35,249 --> 01:43:38,207
I did my best. Open your eyes.

1444
01:43:38,416 --> 01:43:39,832
Oh my god.

1445
01:43:39,999 --> 01:43:41,332
It's terrible.

1446
01:43:41,582 --> 01:43:43,082
- It's really bad.
- No! It looks good.

1447
01:43:43,249 --> 01:43:44,499
No.

1448
01:43:44,707 --> 01:43:45,499
Look...

1449
01:43:45,749 --> 01:43:48,332
leather jacket, without sleeves.

1450
01:43:48,666 --> 01:43:50,374
A Village People-like cap.

1451
01:43:50,707 --> 01:43:53,041
I know! Jose Bove.

1452
01:43:53,707 --> 01:43:55,666
You look exactly like him.

1453
01:43:56,041 --> 01:43:58,582
Really weird.
An orthodox priest or something.

1454
01:43:58,749 --> 01:44:01,374
- The pope.
- Exactly, the pope.

1455
01:44:02,332 --> 01:44:03,707
Come on.

1456
01:44:05,374 --> 01:44:06,791
He's crazy.

1457
01:44:07,082 --> 01:44:09,124
What are you up to?

1458
01:44:10,374 --> 01:44:13,999
- I'm scared.
- No you'll see, it's awesome.

1459
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:17,999
I look like my grandfather.

1460
01:44:18,374 --> 01:44:19,291
Really?

1461
01:44:19,582 --> 01:44:24,082
Oh Philippe, the moustache is turning me on.
What is happening to me?

1462
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:26,582
- Ok, I'll shave the rest.
- Thank you.

1463
01:44:26,916 --> 01:44:28,374
Alright.

1464
01:44:29,166 --> 01:44:31,624
No. Please. No.

1465
01:44:32,041 --> 01:44:33,166
No.

1466
01:44:33,541 --> 01:44:34,166
No.

1467
01:44:34,582 --> 01:44:35,707
Nein!

1468
01:44:35,957 --> 01:44:39,457
- Nein is what you mean.
- I'm not ok with that.

1469
01:44:39,874 --> 01:44:42,291
Philippe, ach.

1470
01:44:42,499 --> 01:44:45,416
So I'm your toy now.

1471
01:44:46,082 --> 01:44:48,291
You know you're mental right?
You have to get help.

1472
01:44:48,541 --> 01:44:50,457
Don't you feel like invading
countries right now?

1473
01:44:50,666 --> 01:44:52,832
Ok, we're getting there...

1474
01:44:53,207 --> 01:44:55,249
just shave the rest.

1475
01:44:55,541 --> 01:44:56,832
You think it's funny?

1476
01:44:57,166 --> 01:44:59,291
Yes, I'm thinking about
tetraplegic nazis.

1477
01:44:59,624 --> 01:45:04,249
How could they do the sign?

1478
01:45:05,207 --> 01:45:08,166
Ok, now you had fun. Shave it.

1479
01:45:10,499 --> 01:45:12,624
Heil.

1480
01:45:19,624 --> 01:45:20,999
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1481
01:45:21,291 --> 01:45:23,082
Vassary.
I have a reservation at 1.

1482
01:45:23,291 --> 01:45:26,249
- Yes. Vassary.
- Follow me.

1483
01:45:31,499 --> 01:45:33,749
- Over here.
- Thank you.

1484
01:45:34,207 --> 01:45:36,082
Thank you, sir.

1485
01:45:54,791 --> 01:45:56,291
So, Philippe.

1486
01:45:56,541 --> 01:45:58,832
I'm not staying for lunch.

1487
01:45:59,916 --> 01:46:02,332
- Why?
- I'm not leaving you alone.

1488
01:46:03,041 --> 01:46:06,374
You just happen to have a date.

1489
01:46:06,916 --> 01:46:08,124
A date?

1490
01:46:08,457 --> 01:46:09,957
What do you mean?

1491
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:12,249
Don't freak out. It'll be fine.

1492
01:46:12,624 --> 01:46:13,499
What the...

1493
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:17,082
Only this time you can't flee.

1494
01:46:18,124 --> 01:46:19,624
By the way...

1495
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:24,332
I took my time, but I found it.

1496
01:46:24,582 --> 01:46:26,832
Give her my respects.

1497
01:46:27,957 --> 01:46:29,166
Driss.

1498
01:46:30,666 --> 01:46:31,957
Driss.

1499
01:46:34,666 --> 01:46:37,332
What's going on?

1500
01:46:56,916 --> 01:46:59,749
Hello, Philippe.

1501
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:45,041
Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo now lives in Morocco.
He's married again, and has two daughters.

1502
01:47:48,999 --> 01:47:54,582
Abdel Sellou now owns a company.
He's married and has three children.

1503
01:48:12,957 --> 01:48:17,707
Philippe and Abdel
remained close friends.
