1
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,678
Good afternoon and welcome to the
Phase II Press Conference of the

2
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,045
upcoming mission for the
Global Precipitation Measurement.

3
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,186
To discuss the mission we have
with us John Stockton

4
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,850
GPM Project Formulation Manager
from NASA HQ.

5
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,123
Mohan Bhargava...

6
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,828
Project Manager and Spacecraft
Mission Director from GODDARD.

7
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,495
Over to you John.
- Thank you George.

8
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,770
The Office of Management and Budget
released the President's 2004

9
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:25,604
fiscal year budget plan in early February
flagging off the GPM Launch.

10
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:30,109
We have in the Formulation phase
of GPM taken steps to reduce risks

11
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,445
to ensure a mission
confirmation review.

12
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:38,018
That's where Mohan Bhargava,
our Project Manager comes in.

13
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,853
Thank you John.
Good afternoon everybody.

14
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,859
Before I come to Phase II, a quick update
on the recently concluded Phase I.

15
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,800
In Phase I we focused on the
Definition of Mission Scope,

16
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:54,106
Systematic Measurement Approach
and Technology Roadmaps.

17
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,203
Will you roll the tape please?
Thank you.

18
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,339
The core satellite is designed
like a TRMM Spacecraft.

19
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:08,018
It'll be launched in non-sun-sync
orbit at an inclination of 65-degrees

20
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,854
and an altitude of 400 kms.

21
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:15,487
The constellation satellites would be
pre-existing operational, experimental &

22
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,756
dedicated satellites,
with PMW radiometers.

23
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,227
They would operate both in
non-sun-synch and synch orbits

24
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,099
at an altitude of 600-900 kms.

25
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,513
You are welcome to
throw any questions.

26
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,851
What are the objectives of the Global
Precipitation Measurement programme?

27
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,394
Last question.
- Is this budget justified?

28
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,424
Globally, there is a danger of
water recession in the near future.

29
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,700
It will not be unreal to imagine that
in the 21st century, cities like

30
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:09,473
Beijing, Amman, New Delhi, Santiago,
Jakarta, Mexico City, Lima

31
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:15,114
and many others, will drink up, use up
their surrounding waters and perish.

32
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:22,521
Water is going to be rare. Is it not a
reason enough to justify any budget?

33
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,432
Are there any more questions?

34
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,131
Thank you for being here.
- Thank you very much.

35
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,083
I've never seen John Stockton
smile so much.

36
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,479
He is really very happy with us.

37
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:52,613
The press conference went off well.
And your presentation excellent!

38
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,958
This is a quantum leap for us.

39
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,992
Well, we can now let our hair down
now that Phase I is finally over.

40
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,337
Hey, you've been very quiet.
What's the matter?

41
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,513
I want to get a cup of coffee.
Would you like some?

42
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,145
Make me a strong one.
- Sure

43
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,757
Two new messages,

44
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,521
Hi Mohan. This is Paul tried
calling you at work and your cell

45
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,290
you seem to be in a meeting,
call me back.

46
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,738
Good afternoon Mr. Bhargava, this is
Steven Carter from the BCIS...

47
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:51,216
... your request for citizenship has been
accepted. Please call me on Monday. Bye.

48
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,453
Congratulations! Your request for
citizenship has been accepted.

49
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:09,361
You seem lost.
- Not really.

50
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:15,263
I get it. Work pressures are
stressing you out

51
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,940
and then you have no other interests...
No pubbing, no partying!

52
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,612
Take my advice,
you should get married!

53
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,679
You need a life partner.

54
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,490
Like they say - Happiness
only doubles when it is shared!

55
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,353
It changed My life!

56
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,058
No Vinod, that's not it.

57
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,564
Then what is it?

58
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,632
What's the matter?

59
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,302
Today is the death anniversary
of my parents.

60
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,873
Oh! I'm sorry.

61
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:57,908
No, It's okay.

62
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:05,715
I still vividly remember that I was in my
last year of University in Pennsylvania

63
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,989
... when I received the news
of their car accident!

64
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,359
Now I understand why
you've been so low all day.

65
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,731
You know Vinod...

66
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,474
There's something else,
which has been

67
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,375
pricking my conscience
these last few months.

68
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:31,683
Do you remember Kaveriamma?

69
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,755
Kaveriamma? Your old
maid servant, right?

70
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,854
Please don't call her a maidservant.
She was like a mother to me!

71
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:46,998
I'm sorry. I had no idea.
What about her?

72
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,795
As you know,
I was the only child.

73
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:59,503
My parents brought me up with a lot of
love, they provided me with everything.

74
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,113
But along with them, Kaveriamma too
had a special place in my life.

75
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,055
My mother would
make my breakfast,

76
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,723
while Kaveriamma would feed me.

77
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,726
My parents tucked me into bed,
while Kaveriamma sang me a lullaby.

78
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:26,569
From the age of two to seventeen
she looked after me completely.

79
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:34,208
You could say Kaveriamma was
like a second mother to me

80
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,885
So when was the last time
you met her?

81
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:48,257
At my parent's funeral.

82
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,559
I remember crying like a child
in Kaveriamma's arms.

83
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,665
It was a very tough time for me.

84
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,398
Then I came back here and
began to find a footing in life.

85
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,706
Kaveriamma would often write me letters,
and I would send her replies as well.

86
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:15,545
But later, I got so completely immersed in
my work, that I just lost touch.

87
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,153
All this is so out of the blue Mohan.

88
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,695
why did you suddenly
think of her today?

89
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,695
It's not sudden, Vinod.

90
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,261
I've been thinking about her
since the past few months.

91
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,402
I've been having recurring
nightmares of her being...

92
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,534
... old, feeble, and helpless.

93
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,773
Vinod, I have blundered.

94
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:52,114
I now feel very guilty
that I have neglected her...

95
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,127
... and haven't been able to
look after her.

96
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,458
I had become selfish Vinod.

97
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:06,400
She is the only thread who can
string the memories of my parents.

98
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,714
I was thinking of going to Delhi...
and bringing her here.

99
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,386
Absolutely! Brilliant idea!

100
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,292
But I don't think John will consent.

101
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:32,125
There can't be a better time for you
to ask for a vacation than now,

102
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:37,225
We are 28 weeks away from
the GPM launch. John won't refuse.

103
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,702
You think so?
- Yeah sure.

104
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,570
Promise to bring him back an
elephant or something.

105
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,075
Yeah sure!

106
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,121
Thank you very much.

107
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,835
So its on the outmost importance
to get the time pressure on the

108
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,096
stabilization unit.

109
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,773
Thank you very much gentlemen.

110
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,573
Excuse me John.
- Sure, tell me.

111
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,983
I have a request for two weeks off.
Need to go to India, is it possible?

112
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,915
Is everything ok back home?

113
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,811
Oh yeah everything is allright.
Just a pending matter.

114
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,251
When do you have to leave?

115
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,259
Actually as soon as possible.

116
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,389
28 weeks to launch?

117
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,263
You realize you have to delegate
some of this to others.

118
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,496
Oh yes yes I'll have a detailed
meeting with the team and

119
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,295
I'll be in constant touch
with Vinod from here.

120
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,740
Alright then, have a good trip.

121
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,171
Thank you very much John.

122
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,947
Amazing... John agreed very quickly.
I should have asked for a vacation myself.

123
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,813
Thank God you didn't. If you had,
he would have cancelled mine too.

124
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,600
May I clear your tray please?
Can I get you anything else?

125
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,969
No thank you.

126
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,073
This is your Captain here.
Good morning everyone.

127
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,767
We have now started our descent

128
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,343
And in a short time we'll be landing

129
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,809
at the Indira Gandhi
International Airport in Delhi.

130
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:44,917
Hope you had a comfortable flight
Thank you for flying Air India.

131
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,732
Your attention please.

132
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:36,840
Announcing the arrival of flight
Al-112 from New York

133
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,312
Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

134
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,344
How was the flight?
- Connecting flight was delayed. Rest ok!

135
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,786
Did you get anything for me?
- Yeah, everything's for you, kid!

136
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:54,051
So Kaveriamma... is she still living
in an Old age Home?

137
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:56,991
Did you speak with her?

138
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,054
No, I want to surprise her!

139
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,902
She'll be so glad to see you.
I'm sure she'll have forgotten me.

140
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,294
Obviously!

141
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,095
Excuse me.
- Yes? May I help you?

142
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,794
I've come to meet Kaveriamma.

143
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,929
Kaveriamma?
- Yes.

144
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,767
Kaveri oh yes! She doesn't
live with us any longer.

145
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,334
Doesn't live here?
- She stayed with us for about a year...

146
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,776
... till a woman came looking for her.
And then, Kaveri left with her.

147
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,909
But where did she go?

148
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,711
Just a minute,
I'll have to check the register.

149
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,726
Bharati<i>ji</i>, this gentleman is
looking for Kaveri.

150
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,169
Do you know where
is she now?

151
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,069
Bharati<i>ji</i> used to share
the room with Kaveri.

152
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,937
I remember her mentioning
a village before leaving.

153
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,277
Now what was it... ?

154
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,409
Charanpur.
- That's right, Charanpur.

155
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,349
Where is this Charanpur?
- Never heard of it.

156
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,849
We'll find out.

157
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,052
Kaveri was a good woman.

158
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,854
We all miss her.

159
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,760
Here's the address.

160
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,102
Thank you!

161
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,570
Kaveri is very fortunate.

162
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,238
There was someone who came
for her then, and now once again.

163
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,216
Otherwise who cares
for old ones like us?

164
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:02,751
Come on.

165
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:11,794
Excuse me.

166
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,998
Here's the map.
You'll find Charanpur in here.

167
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,699
That'll be 150 rupees.
- That's ok. Don't pay me.

168
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,104
Do me a favor. Watch the counter
for me while I nip to the bank.

169
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,868
Get me a loan too!
- Sure, you'll manage the counter, right?

170
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,736
I'll just sit behind.

171
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,277
That's good.
- Come back soon.

172
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,584
Excuse me you've no respect?

173
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,521
What happened?

174
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,763
You can see I am picking up books,
and still you're walking all over them.

175
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,433
I did not mean to.

176
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,295
Look, books are a source
of knowledge and culture...

177
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,202
and if you don't know how to respect
them, you shouldn't be here.

178
00:17:56,608 --> 00:18:00,510
Well I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

179
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,107
I'm sorry, I was just
looking at this map.

180
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,749
You want to buy these books?

181
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,919
No! I want to sell them!!

182
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,651
Oh stupid question, I'm sorry.
- No I'm sorry.

183
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,854
Actually I'm just a little irritated.
- No, I saw what happened.

184
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,896
You dealt with the man right.

185
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,501
Some people just don't have
the basic etiquette.

186
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:03,639
Oh yeah... I'll do this for you.
Lots of books.

187
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,838
I will need a...
- Over there.

188
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,114
Yes, thank you.

189
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:17,286
That's 13 books of Mathematics into 17...

190
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:23,587
... is equal to 221/- + 22 Language
books into 12 is equal to...

191
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:24,989
Four-eighty five.

192
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,860
Four-eighty five!

193
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:38,733
That's 8 Geography books into
19 is 152, plus 485 is...

194
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,611
Six-thirty Seven!

195
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:47,380
Really 637? Thanks.

196
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:56,023
And these 8 note books at 113
and the total is...

197
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,022
Seven fifty.

198
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,688
Must be right!

199
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:06,830
750 it is.
Your... maths is pretty good!

200
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,068
Actually, I should be
giving you a concession.

201
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,572
You selected the books,
you did the totalling...

202
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,349
you should be in my chair!

203
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,415
Then give me a concession?

204
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,981
Sorry I can't!

205
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,390
Actually my name is Mohan Bhargav.
I'm Rahul's friend...

206
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,060
... he's the owner of this shop,
he's just gone to the bank...

207
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,991
... he was broke you see...
needed to get some money

208
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,499
I'm just filling in for him.

209
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,170
Oh!

210
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,706
I'll just pack this for you
I just need...

211
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:43,841
Bags.

212
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,876
I have been looking
for Charanpur in this map

213
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,278
It's a small little village.

214
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,953
Have you heard of it?

215
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,258
Yes, I know where it is.

216
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:07,088
Go down National Highway No. 6 for
110 kms till you reach Charoti.

217
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,091
Take a left from there.

218
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,271
Then keep going for 80 kms till
you reach Azamgarh.

219
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:18,568
From there 20 kms on a dirt track,
you'll reach Charanpur.

220
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:24,441
Wow! Your geography seems
pretty good as well!

221
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,985
Here you...

222
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,624
Hello! Excuse me.

223
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,695
Please look after the counter...

224
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,143
What happened?
You sick of the job already?

225
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,579
No, a girl came in, bought a lot of
books... but left without her change.

226
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,076
Hey! Not bad!

227
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,047
You made a profit for the company on the
very first day! You've got the job!

228
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,156
She was amazing!

229
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,722
She even gave me directions
to Charanpur!

230
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,358
Great, where is it?

231
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,189
About 200 kms from here.

232
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,526
Spare me Mohan. Don't expect me to
leave the store and drive you there.

233
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,694
No worries!
I'll need a car though.

234
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:25,206
Take mine.
- No, no. Could I get a caravan?

235
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,037
Caravan? What for?

236
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,473
Don't know the conditions I'll have
to face in the village.

237
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,385
Ok, ok Mr. NRI
<i>(Non-Resident Indian)</i>

238
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,550
You'll have your caravan.
Don't worry.

239
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:44,751
<i>(Old Hindi film song)</i>

240
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,635
Can you tell me which of these
paths will lead to Charanpur?

241
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,032
You have strayed from the path.

242
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:35,135
Really?
I've been following directions...

243
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,145
I must have taken a wrong
turn somewhere.

244
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,981
It was your destiny to make
this mistake.

245
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,512
Charanpur is pretty far from here.
I'm headed in that direction.

246
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,390
If you want,
I can show you the right path!

247
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,038
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

248
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,549
How beautiful is this world

249
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:53,718
Forget thy troubles all
Behold! The beds of flowers enthrall

250
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:57,224
Heed thee vibrant world's call

251
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:16,879
Wow!

252
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,413
Encore!

253
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,081
Sing.

254
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,916
This path now bids me:

255
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:34,258
Somewhere, someone's
waiting for thee!'

256
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,599
This path now bids me:

257
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,762
Somewhere, someone's
waiting for thee!'

258
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:54,278
Why doth my heart impatient be?
Who longeth to meet me?

259
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:58,445
Perhaps, in the narrowing compass
What I'd cherished is coming to pass

260
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:02,957
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

261
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:06,460
Life's a car; Time's the wheel

262
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,629
There's the river of tears for sure
And a garden of joys too, secure.

263
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:15,135
O brother, all these stare
intently upon thy path

264
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:20,304
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

265
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,811
How beautiful is this world

266
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:28,983
Forget thy troubles all
Behold! The beds of flowers enthrall

267
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:32,816
Heed thee vibrant world's call

268
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:54,842
Wherever I cast my eye
upon these paths

269
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,009
Colours stream in my glance

270
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:03,677
The breeze is cool, the shade cool too

271
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:07,855
Far, over there, I wonder whose
hamlet stands

272
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,529
Ah! How didst the rain clouds amass?

273
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,699
That my heart was brought
to such a pass

274
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:20,531
What dream have I seen?
- That every dream doth true appear,

275
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:27,201
Kindling fire in my body
If thy heart's path thou traverseth

276
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:31,371
Thou shallst pick pearl from
The oyster every moment

277
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:36,213
Only if thou couldst always
heed thy heart

278
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:40,551
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

279
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,887
How beautiful is this world

280
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:48,961
Forget thy troubles all
Behold! The beds of flowers enthrall

281
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,896
Heed thee vibrant world's call

282
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,427
The heart experienceth such ease

283
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:27,768
As though the burden upon the
shoulder hath dropped off

284
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:32,102
As though innocence of
childhood hath returned

285
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:36,611
As though at longest last in
River Ganga hast one had bath

286
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:49,785
As though at longest last in
River Ganga hast one had bath

287
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:54,124
The heart purged as it were
Every bond at large

288
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:58,291
I find the life sanctified now

289
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:02,303
There's love in my living,
a song upon the lips

290
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:06,637
This is verily the triumph of
thy life, O traveller!

291
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:10,975
Whichever direction thou goest,
Love alone thou squander

292
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:15,642
You light a million lamps,
O traveller!

293
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:19,984
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

294
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:23,649
Who is it that haileth me

295
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:28,826
The river, hill, lakes and streams,
the woods and trees

296
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,658
Who's it that signals from these

297
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:54,347
Go on, O traveller

298
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:02,331
How beautiful is this world

299
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,567
Excuse me.

300
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,545
Do you know where Kaveri<i>ji</i> lives?

301
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,745
Hey Chikku!
Take this man to Kaveri<i>ji</i>

302
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,263
Sorry!
- Watch it!

303
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,993
Amma! Amma!
<i>(Motherl Motherl)</i>

304
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,163
Amma!

305
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,158
Amma!

306
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,665
Wait a while.

307
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:50,503
She needs to be massaged like this
in the morning and evening, Maithili!

308
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,938
She'll cry a little, but ignore it.

309
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,407
Understood?
Now say.

310
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,478
Amma, someone has come
to meet you in a very big car.

311
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,143
A very big car?

312
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:03,149
Come on, now!
It's parked outside.

313
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,548
I am coming.

314
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,657
Chikku, hope this isn't
one of your pranks!

315
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:11,829
Look at that.

316
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,765
It's very big; isn't it?

317
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,503
What's going on?

318
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,007
Huh, who is this?

319
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,248
Go on take a guess!

320
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:35,976
I can't. Come on, who is this?
Let go of me!

321
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,348
Atkan batkan dahi chatokan,
<i>(Lord Krishna's childhood couplet)</i>

322
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,616
If you're Yashoda, then who am I...?
<i>(Lord Krishna's childhood couplet)</i>

323
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,256
Mohan!

324
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,258
Mohan!

325
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,260
Kaveriamma.

326
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,937
Mohan... it's you, it's really you!

327
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,605
I can't believe my eyes!

328
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,284
Do you know who this is?
This is Mohan, my Mohan!

329
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,287
The one I keep talking
to you about.

330
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,883
Come...

331
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:21,625
Stop! Wait right here.
Do not step inside. I'll be back.

332
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,311
Now you can come in!

333
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,149
Kaveriamma.
- Yes?

334
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,646
Oh... what are you doing?

335
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:35,829
I can't express how happy
I am to see you Mohan.

336
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:52,519
Let Gita come.
I'll tell her I've won the bet.

337
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,688
Bet? What bet?

338
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:02,526
Gita always said
"Your Mohan has forgotten you, Amma."

339
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:03,529
Really?

340
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:07,693
But I would always retort:
"No, he will come to meet me."

341
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,707
And then we had a bet!

342
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,867
If you did come, she would have to
treat me to an ice cream.

343
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,047
Ice cream? Kaveriamma!

344
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,712
Why?
- Because you haven't changed a bit!

345
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,885
You haven't lost your
appetite for ice-creams!

346
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:22,882
Why not?

347
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:26,545
Why not? Are ice creams meant only
for kids? Can't we oldies enjoy it?

348
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:27,722
Sit!

349
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:33,561
All right, you win. And by the way,
who says you're old?

350
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:41,066
So... who is this Gita?

351
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,475
Don't you remember?
You often played with her as a child.

352
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:48,200
She used to visit our Delhi house
with her mother.

353
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:49,713
Gita...

354
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:54,207
Are you referring to that
'Gitlee' by any chance?

355
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,948
Yes!
You called her that.

356
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:01,023
And this is Nandan
Gita's younger brother.

357
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:06,193
But we lovingly call him Chikku.
- Chikku! Hey Chikku!

358
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:11,961
He has faked a tummy ache today
so that he can miss school.

359
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,006
How old are you?
- Eight.

360
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,681
Which school do you go to?

361
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,680
I study in Navjeevan Paathshala.

362
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,844
My roll number is 6
and I am in the fourth standard!

363
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,181
The motto of our school is

364
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,417
Books are a source of knowledge
and knowledge is strength.

365
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,025
Your school seems to be a good one.

366
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,525
Why haven't you gone today?
- I had a stomach ache.

367
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:43,699
Really?

368
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,532
Was the pain here?
Or here?

369
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,707
Would you like to see my school?
- No, not now.

370
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:54,537
I want to talk to Amma.
- No ! Let's go right now.

371
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:55,871
All right Chikku.

372
00:36:56,447 --> 00:37:00,213
Mohan, why don't you
go visit the school with Chikku.

373
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,886
You can meet Gita as well.
She teaches there.

374
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,380
Ok, but I thought Chikku had a
stomach ache!

375
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,219
Ache? Oh yes!
It was there, but it just went away!

376
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,395
Let's go to my school now!

377
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,665
That's Uncle Postman!

378
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,473
Not just postman my dear

379
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,075
... I'm the plough and the bull, field
and seed, crop and the grains.

380
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,247
I am everything here!

381
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,917
I sort the letters, seal them
and distribute them as well!

382
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,753
When on my bicycle, I'm the Postman
and in my chair, Postmaster.

383
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:42,255
The name is Nivaaran Dayal Shrivastava.
How can I help you?

384
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,754
Can I call America from here?

385
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:49,589
There is no ISD here, but you can get
connected through Mizwa village.

386
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,931
By the way, there is no bank, no bond,
and no registry in this village.

387
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,275
I apologise, for the trouble
earlier today.

388
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,311
That's ok. You live abroad, right?
- Yes.

389
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,113
I too happen to know some English.

390
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,119
What can I do for you?

391
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:12,614
Very good.

392
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,127
Look Mohan<i>bhaiyya</i> this is my school!
<i>(bhaiyya - brother)</i>

393
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,023
I'm impressed, Chikku!

394
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:29,965
It was in 1942 that

395
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:33,142
the slogans of the 'Quit India Movement'
were first heard in Bombay.

396
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:38,304
From Bombay to Lahore (in Pakistan),
Lahore to Peshawari...

397
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:42,808
the Indian revolutionaries and the
British soldiers were locked in conflict!

398
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,320
Blows were dealt in succession,
bullets were whizzing and ricocheting.

399
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:51,325
But through all of it our protests were
on, and we never raised our hands!

400
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,727
I got hit by a bullet on
the shoulder as well.

401
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,163
Then they arrested us and
threw us in prison

402
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,997
... we kept protesting- Inquilab zindabad!
<i>(Long live the Revolution)</i>

403
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:04,333
Dada<i>ji</i>, did you have a beard then?
- I wish I did!

404
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,841
Then the bullet would have got stuck
in my beard and got lost!

405
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,279
I... am... going!

406
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,475
I... am... going!

407
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,513
We... both are... going!

408
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:20,350
We... both are... going!

409
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,688
We... all are... going!

410
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,020
We... all are... going!

411
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,989
Very good! Kamala, now you repeat...

412
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,861
I... am... going!

413
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,206
It's you!

414
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:40,365
I must have misunderstood your
directions and got lost.

415
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:44,373
Excuse me! This is a school
and a class is in progress.

416
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,412
I'm sorry.

417
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:49,712
Mohan bhaiyya this is Gita didi.
And didi didi, this is Mohan bhayya...

418
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,548
He has come from Aamkarica!
- Not Aamkarica, Chikku! America.

419
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,555
Chikku, what are you doing here?
I thought you had a stomach ache!

420
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,059
Amma asked me to show
Mohan bhaiyya the school so I just...

421
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,557
So you are Gita! Remember me?

422
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,064
I used to call you 'Gitlee'
when we were kids.

423
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,733
The children are
supposed to be studying.

424
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,636
I'm sorry.

425
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:20,075
Now I understand.
Mathematics, Geography...

426
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,749
Oh yeah, by the way...

427
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,913
... you forgot your 50 rupees
at the bookshop!

428
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,091
Thank you, will you please go now?

429
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,059
Yes. I'm very sorry.

430
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,229
I... am... going!

431
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,928
I... am... going!

432
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,163
Very good.

433
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,384
What's this?

434
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,453
This is a foot massager, that'll take
care of your aching feet.

435
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,452
There is no electricity at the moment.
- Why?

436
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,119
We have power failures quite often.
- Oh, when will it resume?

437
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,294
Nothing can be said for sure.
This happens 3-4 times a week.

438
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:15,327
Who are they?

439
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,801
Gita's parents Shanta and Jagmohan<i>ji...</i>

440
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,637
who started the school in Charanpur.

441
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,082
When Chikku was only five,
Jagmohan<i>ji</i> passed away.

442
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:31,317
Gita was studying in a college
in Delhi at that time.

443
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,984
As soon as she graduated,
she came here...

444
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:38,491
... to help her mother with the
running of the school.

445
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,998
But Shanta's health was on the decline,

446
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,397
till a point when she sent Gita to the
Old Age Home to fetch me.

447
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:51,668
Before dying, Shanta entrusted
the upkeep of Gita and Chikku to me.

448
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:11,862
Thanks.

449
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:17,193
Why did it take you so long, Gita?
- I had to correct a few test papers.

450
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,931
Thought I may as well finish it there.

451
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:24,701
Didi, didi, look what
Mohanbhaiyya got for me!

452
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,707
Guess what I'm going to
cook for you Mohan!

453
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:28,708
Very nice.

454
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,046
Your favorite tadka daal,
aloo ki sabzi and kheer.

455
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:33,650
Wow!

456
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,221
Gita! Now you will have to treat me
to an ice-cream.

457
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:39,882
You lost the bet.

458
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,230
Oh Kaveriamma, I've missed your food.

459
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,235
The kheer was especially good.

460
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,328
I knew you would like it.

461
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,073
Enough about me.

462
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:02,403
Now tell us about yourself... and America.

463
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:06,416
Everything's fine in America.

464
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,813
I have all the comforts.
I have all that I could ask for.

465
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,752
I'm glad to hear that.

466
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,782
And how is your nasha going on?
<i>(nasha - Hindi slang for drugs)</i>

467
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,321
Nasha?

468
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,757
Why? Have you quit it?

469
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,265
Nasha?

470
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:31,267
Nasa? NASA??

471
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:32,271
That's what I meant.

472
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:36,344
My work at nasha... I mean NASA
is going very well.

473
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,547
So, you're an astronaut?

474
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:43,749
No.

475
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:49,456
I'm a Project Manager for
Global Precipitation Measurement! GPM.

476
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,626
Global Precipitation Measurement.

477
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:56,564
Very good.

478
00:43:56,767 --> 00:44:00,294
Look at this Mohan bhaiyya!

479
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:04,969
Wow! Very good. You are a great artist!

480
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,609
Chikku, you bunked school today.
And, you have to catch up with studies.

481
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,908
Good night Chikku!
- Say good night!

482
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,989
I owe you an apology.

483
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,488
Apology? For what?

484
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,227
I'm sorry...

485
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,836
... that I wasn't there to take care of you

486
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,103
What are you talking about?

487
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,762
Let me talk Kaveriamma!

488
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,536
I'm sorry... that I wasn't there to
take care of you.

489
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:45,837
I'm sorry... that I was not there
when you needed me most.

490
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:52,515
I'm sorry... that you had to go
to an Old Age Home.

491
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,753
Not another word now!

492
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,527
Son...

493
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,595
... these are all matters of destiny.

494
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,035
I have everything...

495
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,529
Everything, but you!

496
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,101
I miss you very much Kaveriamma.

497
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,201
Will you come with me?

498
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:13,767
Where?

499
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:15,368
America.

500
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:20,213
No, I'm fine here!

501
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,781
Just come with me, you'll love it there.

502
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:28,384
You'll get a lot of rest and peace.
It's a much better life there.

503
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:33,891
Let me think about this.

504
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,061
Come on now...

505
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,863
You should go to sleep here.

506
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:46,238
Here?

507
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:51,077
If you don't mind,
I will sleep in the caravan.

508
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,075
Now what new machine is this?

509
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,079
One that puts you to sleep!

510
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:56,885
Something like that!

511
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,919
Good Night.
- Good Night.

512
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,925
Good Night.
- Good Night.

513
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:46,592
Yes?

514
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:49,599
Yesss??

515
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:52,734
Sir, I am Mela Ram!

516
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,669
Hello. What do you want?

517
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,531
Sir, I have brought you breakfast.

518
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,276
Please try my breakfast.
- Breakfast? Not now.

519
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,446
Sir please, I made it especially for you.

520
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,941
I am a very good cook.

521
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,284
Got it... means understood!

522
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:23,793
You're a good cook! I'm impressed.
- Thank you sir.

523
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:31,235
You have come from America sir?

524
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,304
I have a question sir.

525
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,310
In America, are there a lot of highways?

526
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,646
Yes, there are. They are
called freeways there.

527
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,151
Got it!

528
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:43,649
Means I understood.

529
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,820
One more question, sir.

530
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:49,993
Be comfortable.

531
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:53,394
Do they have <i>Dhabas</i> on these freeways?
<i>(dhaba - an Indian fast food joint)</i>

532
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:54,664
Dhaba?
- Yes.

533
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,028
Sort of. Why?

534
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,328
What do you think?

535
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:04,667
Will an Indian dhaba
work on those freeways?

536
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,178
I think it'll work!
- Will it work?

537
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:16,046
I think maybe... thanks for the dhaba,
I mean breakfast!

538
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,185
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got to get ready!

539
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,515
Of course sir.

540
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,688
I'll meet you again sir.

541
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,591
Thank you, Thelaram.

542
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,261
Sir it's Mela Ram!
- Sorry, Mela Ram.

543
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:29,729
Sir last question.

544
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,693
Sir I will give you a very good offer sir.

545
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,871
We'll open a dhaba in partnership.

546
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,302
I will give you 50%
half share of all the money I make

547
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,102
I have even thought of a name
for this dhaba.

548
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:43,811
It will be called...

549
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:47,780
...Mela Ram Dhaba. Ok?
- Ok.

550
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,549
Happy?
- Very happy.

551
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,517
It's a deal sir.

552
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,590
Jai Ramji ki!
<i>(Lord Ram be praised)I</i>

553
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:56,551
Jai Ramji ki!
<i>(Lord Ram be praised)I</i>

554
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,418
So this is your caravan!

555
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,083
Not mine. It belongs to a
friend of Rahul's.

556
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,322
It's nice! Isn't it Gita?

557
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,689
Chikku was right.

558
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,594
Really, this car is exactly like a house.

559
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,149
There's a kitchen here...

560
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:01,584
a TV...

561
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,558
a bathroom...

562
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:06,661
a bed too.

563
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:11,759
Wow! This car is like a house on wheels!

564
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,027
Er... yes. Absolutely!

565
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,365
It's very comfortable.

566
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,137
Now we should be going.

567
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,932
We don't want to miss the Panchayat
<i>( A village body for village governance)</i>

568
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:25,312
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Quickly.

569
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,944
District Council is deliberating
upon all the demands...

570
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,653
...made in the last
village panchayat meeting.

571
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,489
The decision will be taken soon.

572
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:37,983
Sadanand<i>ji</i>, please tell us when the
remaining electric wires are being put up?

573
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,062
We plan to start
work as soon as possible.

574
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:45,166
The Gram Panchayat has...
- Just a moment, Sadanand Bajpei<i>ji.</i>

575
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:45,993
I've never seen a Panchayat before.

576
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,000
Whenever you are asked, all you say is
"We plan to start work".

577
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,332
You are the Block Development Officer

578
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:58,504
You are well aware that we have been
dealing with this problem for a long time

579
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:02,617
75% of the village is constantly plagued
with electricity failures

580
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,855
and the remaining one-fourth
still lives in darkness.

581
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:11,183
This is like covering your back
while your front's open.

582
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,362
Then, what's the use of
these electric wires?

583
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:17,522
Dada<i>ji</i>, the Government Surveyor has
recorded his observations...

584
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,361
it is now just a matter of a few days.

585
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:20,866
A few days?

586
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,539
In a few days I'll be at Heaven's Door.

587
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,708
Then you can come
light a bulb on my shrine.

588
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:30,646
Dadaji, don't say that,
may you live a long life!

589
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:34,715
Please don't mind Dadaji, even I have
a complaint against the village.

590
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:38,547
What?
- One hears that Dukhi, Santram and...

591
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,724
... their boys
steal electricity from the poles.

592
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:45,053
It's not us. It's Santram who's the culprit.

593
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,389
Hold your tongue! When did
we steal electricity?

594
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,392
Now I understand why there was
no power last evening.

595
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,071
Calm down everyone!

596
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:02,067
Sadanandji, this job
should be done soon.

597
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,577
Or else we'll take the matter to
the higher authorities.

598
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:07,075
Sangam, what is the next case?

599
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:11,983
Case No.35, the school!

600
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,584
Yes Gitaji?

601
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,089
I wish to continue teaching children
in the existing premises.

602
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,095
The new alternate
place you are suggesting...

603
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:24,933
... is too small...

604
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:28,696
... and then it's also too far. Children
won't be able to walk so much everyday.

605
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:31,066
But why do you need such a big
space for the school?

606
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,043
You don't even have enough
children to fill up the classes

607
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,939
More children will come to
study in the school.

608
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,273
That's what you've been saying
for a year now!

609
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,878
She has been trying!
We've all been trying!

610
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:45,384
Look Dadaji, we need the school
space for the Panchayat.

611
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,452
Then the tehsildars also want to
establish their office in the school.

612
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,583
The village also needs a spare
room for the granary.

613
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,792
It will be the economic
center of the village.

614
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:58,794
And the place we are offering you
is good enough for teaching.

615
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,627
No, it won't be enough

616
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,972
I want to start a few more
classes in the school.

617
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,974
I want to reinstate those children

618
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,140
who've left the school
in the past couple of years.

619
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,805
And then there are some villagers who
are not sending their children to school.

620
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,814
Today, I appeal to all of them to
send their children to school.

621
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,816
All right, Gita.

622
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,323
If you can manage to enroll more
children in the next three months

623
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:26,825
then we're ready to reconsider.

624
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,665
But if there are no new admissions...

625
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,500
then you must agree to move
from the current premises.

626
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:39,668
This month's Panchayat is adjourned.

627
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:51,019
Come Mohan, let me introduce you
to the members of the Panch.

628
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,629
This is my Mohan.
He has just come from America.

629
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,366
Mohan... this is the head of
our village, Vishnuduttji.

630
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:05,466
Hello.

631
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:10,570
Namaste! (Greetings)
- My blessings, son!

632
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,638
Munishwarji.

633
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:15,375
God bless you my son.

634
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:17,205
Gungadinji.
- Namaste.

635
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,245
Fatimabi...
- May you live long my son.

636
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,041
... and Narayanji.

637
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,717
God bless you son.

638
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,317
May Lord Rama protect you.

639
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,714
What do you do in America?

640
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,054
I work in a company called NASA.

641
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:32,458
So, what does this
company manufacture?

642
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,390
We make satellites.

643
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,060
Now what is that?

644
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,733
Oh come on, Fatima...

645
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:45,002
... you know those things in the sky.

646
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:49,406
Satellites er... satellites...
- Let me explain.

647
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,643
Satellites are like
the moon orbiting earth,

648
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,077
which help us to know when,
where and how much it will rain

649
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,583
predict the changes in the atmosphere

650
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:59,254
they send us information
about all these things.

651
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,424
That's it!
- Isn't this what you had told me?

652
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:07,420
Wow Kaveri I'm impressed!
I had no idea you knew so much...

653
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,598
... about these things.

654
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:15,431
All this work that you have described
is done by our Sahdev out here

655
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,265
without rotating himself, believe me!

656
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,531
Hey Sahdev, tell us!

657
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,444
The sky is clear.

658
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:28,110
There will be no clouds in
evidence for the next two days.

659
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,951
Very good! That's precisely what I do too.

660
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,702
Mohan bhaiyya! Look!
That's the temple!

661
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,339
Beautiful!

662
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,403
Beautiful! What's this?

663
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,974
This is the specialty of our village.

664
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:04,483
These are the footprints of
Lord Rama and Sita.

665
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:05,988
What?!

666
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:10,815
Ram and Sita's footprints!

667
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:17,723
Charanpur! Ok.

668
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:22,937
That explains the name of the village
Charanpur. <i>(Charan means feet)</i>

669
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,263
How are you?
- I'm all right.

670
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,536
And Kaveriamma? How is she?
- She's fine.

671
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,610
I've been trying your cell phone.

672
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,880
There is no network coverage here.

673
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:13,620
Vinod I'm no longer in Delhi.
I'm in a village called Charanpur.

674
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,548
Oh. Anyway now what about
the GPM instrument concept

675
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,728
and risk reduction study
that needs to be initialized?

676
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:21,890
I'll e-mail you the graphics right away!

677
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,896
You do that. But the internet
connection here is weak.

678
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,762
I won't be able to
download the graphics.

679
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:30,300
Why don't you Fed-Ex the CD to
Rahul in Delhi? He'll send it to me.

680
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:31,740
Okay.

681
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:33,943
Come fast.

682
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,571
One more thing! The week will
pass by very quickly

683
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,237
All right.

684
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,507
I am going to be here a
little longer than I thought.

685
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:42,215
Kaveriamma has
some pending work here

686
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:44,920
because of which she can't
leave right away.

687
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:46,618
Ok. That's fine.

688
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,416
Can I have a word with John
regarding this? Is he there?

689
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:49,751
Don't worry about that
I will take care about that.

690
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:52,393
See you then.
- Bye.

691
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:53,989
Jai Ramji ki.
(Lord Ram be praised).

692
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:59,667
Well, well... the village lingo's getting
a hold on you. Jai Ramji ki! Bye. - Bye.

693
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:00,793
One moment.

694
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:06,108
How much was that?
518 rupees?

695
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,635
Five hundred eighteen rupees sir!

696
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:15,883
One moment sir.

697
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:19,087
Sir, you just mentioned
the word "internet".

698
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:20,816
I've heard the word "international".

699
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:25,685
but 'lnternet'? What's that?
I think I've heard it before.

700
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:29,825
Internet... Internet is a medium
through which we can...

701
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,560
... connect and communicate
with people in any part of the world.

702
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:36,699
No Post-office needed!
This is called e-mail.

703
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:42,710
E-mail! Really?
Fantastic!

704
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:46,209
If this e-mail is somehow
installed in this village

705
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:49,383
I'll be in seventh heaven.
- How is that?

706
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,678
Because then I wouldn't have
to deliver any letters.

707
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:57,053
I would just sit here and
email them all.

708
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,655
Email is indeed the summum bonum

709
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:02,330
it would break the walls that...

710
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:06,400
... separate home and the world.

711
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:10,030
Thank you sir.
- Okay.

712
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:30,018
Time to get up!

713
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:35,626
Kaveriamma, don't wake me up!
Haven't slept like this in years.

714
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,761
Get up. We have
a lot of work to do now.

715
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,363
The guests will be here at eleven.
The house needs to be cleaned.

716
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,098
What's going on?
Who are the guests?

717
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:50,770
A potential groom is coming to
see Gita with his parents.

718
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:52,605
What?

719
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:55,042
They are from Azamgarh.
- Gita's marriage?

720
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,548
Yes!
- Yes?

721
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:58,713
Gita's marriage... !

722
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,216
I forgot to tell you last night.

723
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:05,250
About two months ago, Vishwasji,
the boy's father had written to me.

724
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:07,657
Now finally they'll be here today.

725
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,727
But what is the need for all this?
- What do you mean?

726
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:14,335
I mean... I mean what's the rush?
She's just a child!

727
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:20,906
What a strange thing to say!
Come on, get ready.

728
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:23,935
Why should I get ready?
As if they're coming to see me!

729
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:58,610
This is Gita.
- Namaste!

730
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,446
This is Raghunath.
- Namaste!

731
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:02,515
Please sit.

732
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,456
Excuse me; I'll just be back.

733
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:19,794
I've heard... you run a school here.
- Yes.

734
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,541
We have a business in chemicals.

735
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:33,975
Really.

736
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:05,143
The demand that you are making
is not acceptable to me.

737
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:09,506
Teaching is my profession
and my passion.

738
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:12,111
And I'd like to continue
this work even after marriage.

739
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,256
A woman's hands are full just
with the household chores.

740
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:20,355
I disagree! I'd like to take care of the
house as well as work.

741
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,862
Let me tell you, that we would not like the
women of our household to work outside

742
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,029
Besides I fail to see why you would
want to keep working after marriage?

743
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:30,797
What if I say the same to your son?

744
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,609
My parents too have brought me up
with equal love and affection...

745
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,803
they expect me to live my life with

746
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:41,941
self-esteem,
independence and self-reliance.

747
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:47,883
If your son has a desire to be something
in life, to make a mark in society

748
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:50,051
then why can't women
have the same desire?

749
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,960
Be it in any field women are
making their mark equally.

750
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:58,627
There's more to a woman than
just wearing bangles.

751
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:02,067
And after marriage, aren't the house
and the children as much...

752
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:04,406
... a responsibility of the man
as the woman?

753
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:08,069
Why can't the husband and wife
work as a team?

754
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:11,310
Why should one of them sacrifice
more than the other?

755
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,648
I don't accept the demand of not
being allowed to work after marriage.

756
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:23,516
You mean... are you rejecting
this proposal?

757
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,320
I have nothing else to say...

758
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,803
This is how the new generation thinks.

759
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:50,346
We should not carry this
matter any further!

760
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:54,782
I'm sorry Shardaji, Vishwasji.

761
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:57,122
It's all right.

762
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:48,275
I'm upset with what happened today.
- But I felt I was right.

763
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:52,344
I don't think you should have
expressed your views in this way.

764
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:53,742
Whatever it is, this is
against my principles.

765
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:56,343
Kaveriamma, Gita is right.

766
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,618
But Mohan, he was a nice boy.

767
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:02,346
You can change people's views
about life over a period of time.

768
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:06,961
Well, you do have a point there.
- No, I couldn't have changed him.

769
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:13,767
Habits can be altered over time but
narrow opinions and beliefs cannot be.

770
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,867
I'm absolutely sure

771
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,040
that their next demand would
be the dowry amount.

772
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,540
Quite possible. I completely
agree with you.

773
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:29,115
This thinking is imbedded in our culture
& tradition and it hampers the nation.

774
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:30,319
Excuse me.

775
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:34,886
Without culture and tradition the
country would be left with no soul.

776
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:38,792
But Mohan, we are not talking
about the country.

777
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:42,792
I know Kaveriamma,
but it's all connected, isn't it?

778
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,902
What is this soul you talk off Gita?
We are plagued with problems.

779
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:49,798
Will you disagree, when I say that
illiteracy is rampant?

780
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:53,006
That we have administrative problems!

781
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,239
We are yet under-developed.

782
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:59,904
That's true! Illiteracy and
poverty are hand in glove!

783
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:03,581
Kaveriamma, your village has
not even got electricity yet.

784
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:08,746
Caste discrimination, overpopulation,
unemployment and corruption...

785
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:12,749
... our state of affairs is pathetic.
Pass me the salt.

786
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:16,431
You have drifted from our topic. But since
you've brought this up, let me tell you...

787
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:18,930
... the Government is trying to find
solutions for these problems.

788
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,603
Yes! Yes! We'll see how much good
their solutions will bring.

789
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:24,432
The infrastructure that the Government
has is not enough to cope with even...

790
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,164
... 1/4th of the existing population,

791
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:29,171
The Government has always failed
in satisfying the peoples' needs.

792
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:32,447
The Government is making policies,
making efforts.

793
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,115
What do you mean by 'efforts'?

794
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:38,116
Just to make resolutions and
collect funds for them

795
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,753
is that where the
Government's work ends?

796
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:43,450
Whether this money even reaches
the grassroot level...

797
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:47,056
... whether the common man benefits
or not from their resolutions...

798
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:48,793
... are they not responsible
for that as well?

799
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:50,598
Yes they are.
- Then...

800
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,391
But what do you think the
Government is, after all?

801
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:55,865
The Government is a system, of
which the public is also a part.

802
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:59,671
You, me, this village... all of us!

803
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:01,806
Now if the system is lacking
in certain things, then...

804
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:05,538
... to rectify its weaknesses
is our responsibility as well.

805
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:09,807
God helps only those
who help themselves.

806
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:12,988
Yes Kaveriamma, but things
are not going to change here.

807
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,486
Because no one wants to change!

808
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:20,222
It's easy for you to criticize.
But are you doing anything about it? No!

809
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:20,953
Excuse me.

810
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,555
At least, I am not defending
the government like you.

811
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,500
I'm building satellites to help
technology advance.

812
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,001
For everyone mankind!

813
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:32,006
Some more curry?
- No!

814
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:35,843
But you are doing it all there.

815
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,172
I'm doing all that I can here,
at the village grass root level.

816
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,348
I'm trying to make this a better place!

817
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,041
Gita... you too are a typical Indian!

818
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,584
You Indians can't take criticism.

819
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,420
You Indians?

820
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:51,916
Sorry, I mean... we Indians... !

821
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:56,197
Anyway, we are aware that not much has
changed in our country in a long time.

822
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:58,863
But I still want to try
and make a difference.

823
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:01,866
You have given up all hope.

824
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:03,197
No I haven't..

825
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:05,764
Yes you have!
- No I haven't!!

826
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:08,869
She's really a fighter, isn't she?

827
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,872
You're no less yourself!

828
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:14,379
Now what is to become of this girl?
He was such a nice boy.

829
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,377
There are other boys...
- I know

830
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,721
But it is not easy to please Gita.

831
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,388
She has too many expectations.

832
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,720
To top all this, there is the school case.

833
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:29,462
And until both these problems are solved
you won't be able to leave with me.

834
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,627
I have a plan...
let's split up the work.

835
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,566
I'm the boy... I mean...

836
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:37,102
... you find a boy and
I will find children for the school.

837
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:39,798
We'll round off all of
Gita's problems.

838
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:42,736
What did you say?

839
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:45,437
Nothing. Nothing at all!

840
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,642
Hail the Lord of Strength!

841
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,588
This is the first lesson in wrestling.

842
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:54,983
Remember it.

843
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,087
There's no letter for you Mohan babu.

844
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,987
You're a wrestler as well?

845
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:05,267
I have been wrestling
since I was a child

846
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:09,737
and it's my favourite hobby.
- Very good.

847
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:15,606
Just out of curiosity, till what
grade have you studied?

848
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:18,939
I mean, you must have worked
very hard to gain this post.

849
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,115
I am a graduate!

850
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:23,008
How fortunate you are!
- Fortunate... yes!

851
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:24,616
But I've also studied very
hard to attain this post.

852
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,114
I'm sure you studied hard

853
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:30,019
but at least you had the
opportunity to go to High School.

854
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,458
I feel very sorry for the
village children.

855
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,153
Why is that?
- I'll explain.

856
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:41,034
What are your views on the school case?

857
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,464
The school case? It's very simple.

858
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:46,505
The school must move from here.
That space is needed for the Panchayat.

859
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,367
That is why I feel bad for
the children of the village.

860
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:53,303
Look... the Panchayat is not allowing for
a High School to be started here

861
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:57,049
and what good is it going to be for
children to have studied till 4th Std?

862
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:01,979
If they want to succeed in life like you
then they must go to High School.

863
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:03,991
True... !

864
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:06,551
Look!

865
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:11,158
It's here the high school will stand.
The children will study here.

866
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:16,736
Then they can start writing letters
for their parents themselves.

867
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:20,334
Think about the work it will save you.

868
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,511
I think the school
should not shift from here.

869
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,348
I will talk to people in the village.

870
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:28,345
You must!
- Definitely

871
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,850
Praise the Lord of Might.
- Praise the Lord of Might.

872
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:35,080
Mohanbabu...

873
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:36,191
Yes?

874
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,288
Why don't you drop by our
wrestling ring sometime?

875
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:44,088
Sure, why not?

876
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,497
How about a wrestling session?

877
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:50,766
Sure!

878
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,971
Mohan babu,
I have a surprise for you...

879
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,879
Here... have some pakodas with
shimla mirch tandoori.

880
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,052
I've made it specially for you.

881
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:08,454
Is this all that you can make?
- No sir, I can cook whatever you desire.

882
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,222
Got it. Listen Mela Ram...

883
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:12,587
Please don't say a word.

884
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:15,055
I know what you have on your mind.
- What?

885
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:17,997
Actually I was thinking...
you must have felt bad.

886
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,067
I'll give you 60%.

887
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:23,063
I'll give you 60% in partnership.

888
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:24,397
Okay.

889
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:27,666
Your lunch and dinner
will be on the house!

890
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,535
I have changed the name of our dhaba.

891
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:34,280
We can call it Mohan's Mela Ram Dhaba

892
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:36,675
or Mela Ram's Mohan Dhaba.

893
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:38,583
You decide. Then we'll lock it.

894
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:41,415
The first one sounds ok.
Mohan's Mela Ram Dhaba.

895
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:45,021
Ok then sir... so deal done, sir?

896
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,088
But before that,
you'll have to help me.

897
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:50,765
Help? How?
- I wish to send the kids from...

898
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:53,491
... your community to the school
for which I need your help.

899
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:55,228
Understood.

900
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:58,603
But it's little difficult sir.

901
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,366
Well, then your going to America

902
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,473
also looks little 'difficult' to me.

903
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:04,509
It is easy sir.

904
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:06,940
I'm ready. Just tell me what I need to do.

905
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:11,517
Our children and their kids in
the same school? Never!

906
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:15,787
Lions and sheep never drink water
from the same pond, Mohanbabu.

907
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:23,123
So...

908
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:25,864
... what is your background?

909
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:29,368
I mean...

910
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:32,030
... what caste are you?

911
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,205
I'm a Brahmin!

912
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,207
Then learn to behave like one.

913
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:41,577
So what am I expected to do?

914
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:45,081
We've heard that you eat food,
cooked by Mela Ram.

915
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,088
Are you aware what his caste is?

916
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:52,752
But what difference does that make?
What age are you folks living in?

917
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,557
Don't you dare degrade our piety!

918
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:58,431
You've fallen, are you out to
drag us down too?

919
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:03,835
And you Nivaaranji, seems like
you've switched sides already!

920
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:07,004
I am only doing what I think is right.

921
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,234
If you have any objections
you don't have to accept this.

922
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:29,258
Hey Birsa. Mohanbabu wants to
have a word with you.

923
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:33,527
What has happened sir?
Have we done anything wrong?

924
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,795
No, not at all.
I just came to ask...

925
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:39,374
... if you would you like to send
your children to school?

926
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:45,945
Huzoor, the villagers that do not
allow us to work in the village...

927
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:49,080
... do you think they will agree
to educate our children?

928
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:54,616
Don't worry.
Your kids will go to school.

929
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:59,717
Also, of what use is studying, now that
they are in their marriageable age?

930
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:03,425
My daughter Lajwa is going
to be engaged.

931
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:08,232
Child marriage!

932
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:13,734
Can you not see our situation?
We barely manage to fill our stomachs.

933
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:16,172
Who is going to pay their school fees?

934
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,880
Gitaji doesn't run the school for money.

935
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:24,347
Teaching is her passion... her life!

936
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,251
If we speak with her

937
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:29,481
we can assure you that
she will help you.

938
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:32,919
The village folks don't
want to see us around.

939
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:34,322
Just listen to me...

940
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:36,825
Let it be saheb.

941
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:41,261
Education is not in their destiny.

942
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:44,662
Not in my children's destiny.

943
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,276
What have you decided Vishnoji?

944
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:54,210
Studies are not going to
fill an empty stomach!

945
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:56,451
Since pottery will be
their livelihood

946
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,415
then why waste time studying?

947
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:01,213
Have you made these?
They are beautiful.

948
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,618
Tell me. How much do
you sell this pot for?

949
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,794
Thirty rupees.
- What!

950
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:08,959
We have a contractor in the city,
who buys it from us.

951
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:11,462
Sometimes we even get an extra
five-ten rupees.

952
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:14,192
We won't sell it for less than thirty!

953
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,797
The price of this pot in the city
is 100 rupees or more.

954
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:20,839
Maybe if you people were educated
you wouldn't be fooled like this.

955
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:24,570
I know that this art has been
passed down through generations.

956
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:28,244
I agree that your kids should
carry on this tradition.

957
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:31,311
But in this day and age, it is
crucial for them to be educated.

958
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,919
Is it not Nivaaranji?
- Absolutely.

959
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:37,250
Because education will help them take
this art to its deserving end...

960
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:40,259
... and earn appropriate prices.

961
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:44,826
You are selling us a dream!
Don't show us these dreams.

962
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:59,005
Namaste Sarpanchji.

963
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:02,509
Welcome Nivaaranji.
Welcome Mohanji.

964
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:04,345
Mohanbabu wanted to discuss...

965
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:06,180
I know, I know. Let me tell you...

966
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:10,081
Both my grandsons are
enrolled in the school.

967
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:13,426
We have great respect for
education in this house.

968
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:17,031
But I have heard that you have
two grand daughters as well

969
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:19,700
and both of them have dropped out?

970
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:22,028
Oh yes, Kusum and Suman...

971
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:24,929
They have both studied
till the fourth grade.

972
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,637
Now how much more can they study?

973
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:29,767
It's time for them
to learn household work

974
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:31,974
cooking and such things.

975
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:34,647
After all, this is what will help
them once they get married.

976
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,516
How can you say such things?

977
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,311
Education instills confidence in girls.

978
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:41,715
Don't you want to see
them study and live their lives

979
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:47,293
with self-respect... independence and...
self-reliance?

980
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,121
There's more to a woman
than just wearing bangles.

981
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,996
Agreed Mohanji!

982
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:56,403
But Charanpur does not even
have a High School

983
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:58,330
for these girls to study in.

984
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:01,333
But Mizwa village does.
You could have sent them there.

985
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:03,240
But now you don't need to
worry about that

986
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:06,914
because Gitaji is planning to open
a High School in Charanpur.

987
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:09,439
If she has your support that is.

988
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,552
Do support us.

989
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,366
No Mohanbabu!
Not possible.

990
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:31,435
But how long are you going to control the
children's lives on the basis of caste?

991
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:35,440
Who are you to tell us what
we should be doing?

992
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:39,109
How much do you know about the
ways and problems of this village?

993
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:41,608
I accept that you were
born in this country

994
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:44,786
but that doesn't mean you can
go around giving sermons.

995
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:49,946
We understand perfectly what we need
to do for the progress of our village.

996
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:52,623
But the only ones who stand to
lose are the children.

997
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:54,625
Enough of this! I don't want
to argue with you.

998
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:55,922
Father.

999
01:18:56,331 --> 01:19:00,199
For heaven's sake, stay out
of the village matters.

1000
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:04,130
Mohanbabu, you are just a visitor here

1001
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:07,137
roam around, enjoy the village...
why get into all this?

1002
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:10,977
Attention!
A movie is to be screened in Charanpur.

1003
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:14,671
Tonight the Panchayat has organized
a movie screening in the village.

1004
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:18,812
You must come and watch...
you'll enjoy!

1005
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:34,395
Get down.

1006
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:46,576
Ok sir, we'll meet later.

1007
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:48,814
Why? Won't you see the movie?

1008
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:51,451
I'll be sitting this side and
watching the movie

1009
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:52,520
Okay.

1010
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:08,934
By the way, which film
are they showing?

1011
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,671
Yaadon ki Baaraat! (Union of Memories)
- Who's union?

1012
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:15,934
Union of Memories!
- Oh, I heard... our union!

1013
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:18,209
Shut up

1014
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,938
Just kidding! It's one
of my favorite films.

1015
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:24,277
Please turn off your lanterns
the film is about to begin.

1016
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:29,221
Dear lords, kind patrons
and art-lovers!

1017
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:31,219
Here's an important announcement:

1018
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:35,963
Mothers must keep a vigilant eye upon
children during the screening.

1019
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:39,790
And please don't disturb your neighbour.

1020
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:45,065
So, presenting the separation
and union of three brothers.

1021
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:49,075
Todays' movie is...
Yaadon ki Baaraat.

1022
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:30,506
Sing us the song which you
always sing on your birthday

1023
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:04,636
What happened?

1024
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:08,277
What happened to the movie?

1025
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:10,017
Not a power failure again!

1026
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,244
Chikku, it's just temporary.

1027
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:13,944
No, it won't come back.
I know it won't.

1028
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:15,952
How much time will this take?

1029
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:18,751
It will take twenty minutes
to start the generator.

1030
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:23,391
Hurry up.

1031
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,763
Don't cry now children!

1032
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,474
Everyone quiet!

1033
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:34,706
Sit down.

1034
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:37,537
All the children on the
other side, quiet! Don't cry.

1035
01:23:37,912 --> 01:23:38,970
Now, listen to me carefully.

1036
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:44,811
Everybody, now look up at the sky
and tell me what you see.

1037
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,824
The stars!

1038
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:58,292
Now tell me... can you see the stars
forming a plough?

1039
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:02,830
Plough?

1040
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:07,368
Yes, plough.
Do you see it?

1041
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:13,339
No.
- I'll help you.

1042
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,280
Look...

1043
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:19,812
... can you see that brightest star
in the sky?

1044
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:22,655
Can you see it?
-Yes.

1045
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:26,627
Along that star on the right
are three stars in a line.

1046
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,191
Yes.

1047
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:32,528
Can you see them?
- Yes.

1048
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:39,036
Now below the third star,
five stars form a curve to the left.

1049
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:48,714
Can you see them?
- Yes.

1050
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:52,282
Now look at them as one.

1051
01:24:57,058 --> 01:25:00,550
Look closely. You will see
the plough taking shape.

1052
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:21,479
I can see it!

1053
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,114
Yes, plough.

1054
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:29,254
So what we must understand is...

1055
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:33,587
... if we want, these stars

1056
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:36,163
... we can make anything out of them.

1057
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:42,159
But if we look at each star,
Though it looks beautiful,

1058
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:47,066
... it is only a
shimmering lone star.

1059
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:25,975
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1060
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:29,444
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1061
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:33,048
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1062
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:36,485
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1063
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:39,990
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1064
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:43,562
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1065
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:47,165
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1066
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:50,895
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1067
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:52,868
Twinkling stars,
a couple o' stars

1068
01:26:53,074 --> 01:26:55,406
a handful, a hundred stars
Shimmering luminaries

1069
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:59,774
every star's a fiery spark!

1070
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:35,112
Thou hast seen the rainbow

1071
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:38,717
Pray, how many art the hues?

1072
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,219
Seven colours so to speak

1073
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:45,756
Yet how many shades its company keep?

1074
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:49,327
Know this to begin,
if the colours wert alone

1075
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:52,863
How couldst a rainbow be full blown?

1076
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:56,559
If we wert not to join hands,
to fight cause unjust

1077
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,467
There wouldst be no public, nor trust

1078
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:03,075
Know thus and protest not,
that the weak hath lost

1079
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:07,044
Hmmm... the star, star

1080
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:10,411
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1081
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:13,982
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1082
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:17,515
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1083
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,928
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1084
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:24,596
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1085
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:28,428
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1086
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:30,297
Twinkling stars,
a couple o' stars

1087
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:32,996
a handful, a hundred stars
Shimmering luminaries

1088
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:36,335
every star's a fiery spark!

1089
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:19,820
Of drops well-gathered

1090
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:23,388
Doth a river swell

1091
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:26,788
Ocean too is of drops assembled

1092
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:30,395
But for the drops, it is but a naught

1093
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:33,999
Grasp this riddle;
for if drop wert all alone

1094
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:37,433
It would be quite nothing.

1095
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:41,074
Wert we to leave others;
desert one and all,

1096
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:44,244
Lonely our lot is, to appall.

1097
01:29:44,445 --> 01:29:48,040
Why not unite then in a single current?

1098
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:51,582
Hmmm... the star, star

1099
01:29:51,786 --> 01:29:55,017
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1100
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:58,587
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1101
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:02,154
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1102
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:05,557
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1103
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:09,203
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1104
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:13,033
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1105
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:14,833
Twinkling stars,
a couple o' stars

1106
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:17,567
a handful, a hundred stars
Shimmering luminaries

1107
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:20,873
every star's a fiery spark!

1108
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:57,250
Peasant who wieldeth a plough,
of earth reapeth gold

1109
01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:04,449
Cowherd tending cows,
of milk a river flows

1110
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:14,934
Blacksmith that mouldeth iron,
every tool fashioneth

1111
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:21,970
Mud that a potter holdeth,
turneth into pitcher

1112
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:25,543
All these art the fonts of labour
And of desire to work a wish

1113
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:29,238
None inimical with any
All art united in common dream

1114
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:35,784
Harken! Everyone's but a kin
None an outsider to pin

1115
01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:39,458
This simple truth, regard thou,
my friend!

1116
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:43,221
Hmmm... the star, star

1117
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:46,491
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1118
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:50,066
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1119
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:53,640
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1120
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:57,303
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1121
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:00,811
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1122
01:32:01,015 --> 01:32:04,644
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1123
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:06,479
Twinkling stars,
a couple o' stars

1124
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:09,349
a handful, a hundred stars
Shimmering luminaries

1125
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:13,152
every star's a fiery spark!
