1
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,381
Nice fat deposit.
You're sure in the right business, Sally.

2
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:44,612
Thank you.

3
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:47,059
Good morning.

4
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:49,418
Deposit.

5
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,618
Another nice deposit.

6
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:01,694
You and Sally are sure
in the right business.

7
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:03,296
I'm in a hurry, please.

8
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,092
Hi, Kate.

9
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:31,579
Have you cleaned up the house
across the way?

10
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:33,016
I haven't had time yet.

11
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:35,173
You should always do that one first.

12
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:43,898
Anne!

13
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:51,092
Come here.

14
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:57,697
Did you ever see that kid out there before?

15
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:00,179
I think maybe he was in the bar last night.

16
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:01,412
Send Joe in.

17
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:03,498
Joe.

18
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:10,621
Hello, Pretty Boy.

19
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,814
- Call me, Kate?
- Yeah. Take a look out the window.

20
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:22,578
There's a kid who's been following me
all the way to the bank and back.

21
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,332
Come here, you young squirt, come here.

22
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:54,652
- You want me?
- What's the idea of throwing that stone?

23
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:57,779
Any law against throwing stones?

24
00:08:58,423 --> 00:09:00,459
You're tough? Come here!

25
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,617
What are you hanging around here for,
anyway?

26
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:10,341
- Would she talk to me?
- Kate?

27
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:13,623
What for? What do you want?

28
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:18,419
Just wanna talk to her.

29
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:21,696
- What do you want, you?
- Nothing.

30
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,056
You live around here?

31
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:28,896
- In Monterey?
- Salinas.

32
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:30,257
What's your name?

33
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,981
You're not talking? Now, look...

34
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:36,099
why are you following Kate around?

35
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:37,891
What's the idea, squirt?

36
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:40,816
Any law against following
around the town...

37
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,701
madam, whatever you call her?

38
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,900
I don't know if there's any law against it,
but she don't like it.

39
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:49,099
She owns that house over there, too,
don't she?

40
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:52,414
But don't you go hanging
around there, squirt. You're too young.

41
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:54,733
Now come on. Now beat it.

42
00:09:54,823 --> 00:09:56,495
Is that her real name?

43
00:09:57,983 --> 00:10:02,215
- Kate. Is that her real name?
- Sure, as far as I know. Why?

44
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:05,181
What's her last name?

45
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:07,942
Nobody's got any last name
around here, kid. Why?

46
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:14,935
You tell her I hate her.

47
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:40,377
I should have gone right on in there.

48
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,612
Should have gone right on in there
and talked to her.

49
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:08,696
Cal wasn't home all night.
Boy, is he gonna catch it from Dad.

50
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:11,297
- You know what the girls in class call him?
- No, what?

51
00:11:11,383 --> 00:11:12,941
The Prowler.

52
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,934
- I'll tell him that.
- You better not, Aron.

53
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:16,342
- Promise me you won't.
- Why not?

54
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:18,618
Please don't. I don't want you...

55
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,541
- Hi, Cal.
- Hi.

56
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:23,102
Hello, Cal.

57
00:11:23,703 --> 00:11:25,182
Excuse me for talking.

58
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:27,936
We're going down to see the icehouse
that Dad's gonna buy.

59
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:29,581
- Do you want to come?
- What icehouse?

60
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,858
The one he's buying
to freeze the vegetables with.

61
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:34,582
He's been talking about it every night
for the last week.

62
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:35,857
Is Dad gonna be there?

63
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:37,899
Why sure, he's gonna buy it.

64
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,216
I'll skip it.

65
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:44,093
You're gonna have
to see him sometime, Cal.

66
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:46,902
- Come on.
- Hey, Aron.

67
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:47,893
Yeah?

68
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:51,853
- Why don't you ask me where I've been?
- Would you tell me?

69
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:55,177
- No.
- Then what's the use of my asking?

70
00:11:57,943 --> 00:12:00,173
- Is Dad mad at me?
- Well, you were out all night.

71
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:02,333
He was worried.

72
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:04,497
Yeah, I bet.

73
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,175
You gonna come or not?

74
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,097
Okay. I'll see you at supper.

75
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:14,538
He's coming.

76
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:17,216
He's coming.

77
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,377
You see, Will, I got the idea
from an article I read.

78
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:29,023
They dug up a mastodon
somewhere in Siberia.

79
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:32,459
Been in the ice for thousands of years
and the meat was still good.

80
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,453
Mastodon?

81
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,692
What have you got to say for yourself?

82
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:45,735
This is my son, Cal.

83
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:49,621
When you were his age,
I imagine you thought it only right...

84
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,217
to let your father know
before you stayed out all night.

85
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:55,818
Or at least to offer some kind
of apology when you did come home.

86
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:57,701
Well, times change.

87
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:02,139
As I was saying,
a mastodon is a kind of elephant.

88
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:04,293
Hasn't lived on the Earth for a long while.

89
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,420
- And the meat was still fresh?
- Sweet as a pork chop.

90
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:10,779
You're more excited about this
than you've been for a long time.

91
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:12,535
Now, I seem to be, don't I?

92
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:15,581
See, Will, I've been sort of
in a rut out there in the ranch.

93
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:19,258
- Sixteen, 17 years, I've kept out of things.
- I know.

94
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:22,574
But now I feel that
if I could only do something...

95
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:27,259
some little thing for, before I die,
some little thing for progress...

96
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,978
for people, maybe.
Call it anything you want.

97
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:33,214
I might make up for all the years
I've been lying fallow.

98
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:37,091
So, lately I've been reading up all I can
about refrigeration.

99
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,619
And I can't get it out of my head
that you can keep anything good...

100
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:44,218
as long as you can get it cold enough.
Like that mastodon there.

101
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:46,533
- Good afternoon, Abra.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Trask.

102
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,851
- Hello, Mr. Hamilton.
- Hello.

103
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:49,058
- Hello, Son.
- Hi, Dad.

104
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:53,136
Now my son, Aron, that is,
thinks I may have a good idea here.

105
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:55,214
Dad wrapped a head of lettuce
in wax paper...

106
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:57,453
and kept it in our icebox
for over three weeks...

107
00:13:57,543 --> 00:13:59,454
and it still came out fresh and good.
Right?

108
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:00,578
Quite right, Son.

109
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:04,736
- Dad, is it all right if we look around?
- 'Course, Aron. Belongs to us now.

110
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,534
Do you know where the biggest market
for vegetables is in the winter?

111
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:11,295
- Where?
- New York City.

112
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,180
And they can't raise them there.

113
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:15,936
But the railroad had promised me
those fruit cars.

114
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:20,057
Don't you have anything to say to me, Cal?

115
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:22,259
- Yeah.
- It's about time. Well?

116
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,780
I read in the Monterey newspaper...

117
00:14:26,863 --> 00:14:29,696
that if we get into this war...

118
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:32,377
there are gonna be some fortunes made.

119
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:36,901
But you're gonna make them
in beans and corn, and stuff like that.

120
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,703
- You don't need all this ice.
- You're perfectly right.

121
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:42,296
Beans are up to 3 cents.

122
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,260
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

123
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,254
And they keep, too, don't they?

124
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,494
But I'm not particularly interested
in making a profit, Cal.

125
00:14:55,223 --> 00:14:56,702
Look here, Will.

126
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:59,616
I'm not an inventor nor a scientist...

127
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:01,773
but I know I have an idea here.

128
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:05,378
I come from a whole family of inventors.
People full of ideas like this one.

129
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:07,454
I'm the only one that didn't have an idea...

130
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:09,215
and the only one that ever made a dime.

131
00:15:09,303 --> 00:15:11,373
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

132
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:14,341
Put out that cigarette!
That place is full of sawdust!

133
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:21,894
- Come on, Adam, he's just thoughtless.
- Thoughtless? He's inconsiderate.

134
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:24,451
I don't know.
I'm at my rope's end with that boy.

135
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:26,340
I don't understand him. I never have.

136
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:29,062
Aron I've understood since he was a child.

137
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:34,132
Help me up.

138
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:40,332
- He doesn't like anybody, does he?
- Who, Dad?

139
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:41,981
No, Cal.

140
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,621
It's dark in here and spooky.

141
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:47,415
Why is he so alone all the time?

142
00:15:47,503 --> 00:15:50,540
- He wants to be.
- Nobody wants to be alone all the time.

143
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:53,581
Dad's made a wonderful buy, hasn't he?
We'll freeze vegetables.

144
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:55,813
It'll really give him something
to live for now.

145
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,781
What's the matter, Abra,
don't you like Cal?

146
00:15:58,863 --> 00:16:01,172
- I guess I don't know him very well.
- I love him.

147
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:04,573
Well, naturally, he's your brother.
He's scary.

148
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:07,219
- Scary?
- When he looks at you.

149
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:09,580
Sort of like an animal.

150
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:11,381
I don't know, he scares me.

151
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:14,662
Aron, when are we gonna get married?

152
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:18,455
Just as soon as I get through
with that darned school.

153
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:20,901
I wish it was right now.

154
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:24,495
- So do I.
- Do you?

155
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,853
Abra.

156
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:36,342
- When we get...
- I love you, Aron.

157
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:38,891
When we get married,
it's going to be perfect.

158
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:41,697
Everything about it is going to be perfect.

159
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:08,777
You're gonna make
a wonderful mother, Abra.

160
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,581
- I hope so.
- You are.

161
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:13,942
A perfect one.

162
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:18,296
You don't remember your mother at all,
do you, Aron?

163
00:17:18,823 --> 00:17:21,291
No, she died
right after Cal and I were born.

164
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:24,622
Must be hard never to have had a mother.

165
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:29,177
- What's that?
- Look, what's he doing up there?

166
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:31,895
- Crazy guy.
- He's watching us.

167
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:33,974
- No, he isn't.
- Yes, he is, too.

168
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:36,736
Let's move over here. Aron.

169
00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:51,053
- He's not watching us.
- I feel as if he can still see us.

170
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:59,092
I love you, Aron.

171
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:00,855
Really, I do. Really.

172
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:04,299
Sure. I love you, too.

173
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:25,177
Cal, stop! Stop that, Cal!

174
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:27,060
What are you doing? Stop it!

175
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:32,694
"Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven...

176
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:34,296
"whose sin is covered.

177
00:18:35,263 --> 00:18:38,938
"Blessed is the man unto whom
the Lord imputeth not iniquity...

178
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:42,818
"and in whose spirit there is no guile."

179
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,619
And you are forgiven, Cal.

180
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:51,379
I think there is no iniquity
in your actions...

181
00:18:51,503 --> 00:18:53,653
only something I do not know.

182
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:58,063
Why did you push that ice down?

183
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:02,897
I don't know.

184
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:05,172
Was it<i>...</i>

185
00:19:06,023 --> 00:19:09,015
Was it vengeance? Anger?

186
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:13,372
Fear that I would punish you
for not coming home last night?

187
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:15,178
What was it?

188
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:19,697
I wanted to see it slide down the chute.

189
00:19:21,263 --> 00:19:24,460
- Perhaps you had better read from here on.
- I'll read it, Dad.

190
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,773
No, it's for Cal to read.

191
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:28,933
Start at the fifth verse.

192
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,577
Verse 5.

193
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:51,860
"I acknowledge my sin unto thee,
and mine iniquity have I not hid.

194
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:54,582
"I said, I will confess my transgressions
unto the Lord...

195
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:57,097
"and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah."

196
00:19:57,183 --> 00:19:58,138
Go on.

197
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:04,578
Six.

198
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:06,779
And I suggest a little slower, Cal.

199
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:09,297
And you don't have to read
the verse numbers.

200
00:20:09,663 --> 00:20:13,497
"For this shall every one that is godly
pray unto thee.

201
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,574
"And surely in the floods of great waters...

202
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:18,780
"they shall not come nigh unto him.
Selah."

203
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:19,818
Seven.

204
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:21,336
Not the numbers, Cal.

205
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:25,297
"Thou art my hiding place,
thou shalt preserve me from trouble...

206
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:29,092
"thou shalt compass me about
with songs of deliverance. Selah."

207
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,655
- Eight.
- You have no repentance! You're bad!

208
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:35,222
Through and through, bad.

209
00:20:35,303 --> 00:20:38,022
Excuse me. I'll go out and wait for Abra.

210
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:50,014
You're right. I am bad.
I knew that for a long time.

211
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:52,936
I didn't mean that, Cal. I spoke in anger.

212
00:20:53,023 --> 00:20:55,093
Well, it's true.

213
00:20:56,183 --> 00:20:57,855
Aron's the good one.

214
00:20:58,143 --> 00:20:59,940
I guess there's just a certain amount...

215
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:01,934
of good and bad you get
from your parents...

216
00:21:02,023 --> 00:21:04,332
- and I just got the bad.
- That's not true.

217
00:21:04,423 --> 00:21:05,822
Cal, listen to me.

218
00:21:06,343 --> 00:21:08,413
You can make of yourself
anything you want.

219
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:10,733
It's up to you. A man has a choice.

220
00:21:10,823 --> 00:21:13,291
That's where he's different from an animal.

221
00:21:15,863 --> 00:21:18,138
You don't listen. You'll never remember.

222
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:25,817
My mother...

223
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:32,213
she's not dead and gone to heaven...

224
00:21:33,263 --> 00:21:34,218
is she?

225
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:37,616
Why do you ask that?

226
00:21:38,143 --> 00:21:39,895
She's not dead at all.

227
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:43,696
She's not buried in the East
like you said, either.

228
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:45,457
She's alive.

229
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:47,773
- What makes you think so?
- I heard from a guy.

230
00:21:47,863 --> 00:21:49,342
- Who?
- I don't know his name.

231
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:51,539
He was just passing through.

232
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:55,422
How come you told Aron and me she died?

233
00:21:55,503 --> 00:21:57,971
- I thought it would save you pain.
- Pain?

234
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,097
If she was still alive,
where do you think she'd be?

235
00:22:07,183 --> 00:22:10,095
I have no idea. She went East.

236
00:22:10,303 --> 00:22:11,622
How do you know?

237
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:16,216
When she left the ranch we lived on
when you and Aron were born...

238
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,616
I heard she went East.

239
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,614
What was she like? Was she bad?

240
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,419
I guess she<i>...</i>

241
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:28,739
I never really knew what she was like.
She wasn't like other people.

242
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:31,093
There was something she seemed to lack.

243
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,813
Kindness, maybe. Conscience.

244
00:22:36,863 --> 00:22:38,854
I never knew what she was after.

245
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:41,977
- How come she left you?
- I never knew that, either.

246
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:45,738
She was so full of hate.

247
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,383
- Hate for you?
- For everything.

248
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:54,937
You won't tell Aron that she didn't die?

249
00:22:55,663 --> 00:22:56,618
No.

250
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,652
Must not do anything to hurt Aron.

251
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:06,536
Where'd you get that scar
you got on your shoulder, Father?

252
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:08,295
I've told you, Cal.

253
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:12,179
It's an old wound I got
in the Indian campaigns.

254
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:16,178
- Why do you ask that now?
- What'd she look like? Was she pretty?

255
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:20,694
She had the most lovely hands.

256
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:22,136
Like ivory.

257
00:23:23,263 --> 00:23:25,299
She took such good care of them.

258
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:27,942
Her mother had arthritis.

259
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:31,140
She was always afraid
it would come to her in her hands.

260
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:38,775
Talk to me, Father.

261
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:46,136
I got to know who I am.
I got to know who I'm like.

262
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:47,497
I got to know<i>...</i>

263
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:50,217
Where is she?

264
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:53,498
I'm telling you, truthfully, Cal...

265
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:56,498
after she left, I never heard from her.

266
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:01,334
Cal, wait. I want to talk more with you.

267
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:04,620
If you leave this room now
we may never be able to talk again.

268
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:06,782
You coming home tonight, Cal?

269
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,855
What's the difference?
You're home. You're the one he wants.

270
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,411
Good evening, Cal.

271
00:24:13,663 --> 00:24:15,779
High strung. Very high strung.

272
00:24:16,143 --> 00:24:18,941
Good evening, Abra.
Where is my chess victim?

273
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:21,213
- He's waiting for you, Mr. Albrecht.
- Good.

274
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:23,498
What do you suppose he meant by that?

275
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:38,820
Go on, beat it!

276
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:42,694
Your wife has called up three times.

277
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:46,571
- My wife's a...
- I know she is. Now beat it.

278
00:24:55,823 --> 00:24:57,415
Joe!

279
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:04,656
All right, fella, you've run out of money.

280
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:06,540
Mr. Hawks.

281
00:25:10,623 --> 00:25:12,739
- What do you want?
- I want...

282
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:16,213
- What do you want to drink?
- Beer.

283
00:25:27,303 --> 00:25:28,622
Hey!

284
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:31,937
- Where's my drink?
- All right.

285
00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:34,420
That's not very neat, is<i>...</i>

286
00:25:35,223 --> 00:25:36,258
It's okay.

287
00:25:38,783 --> 00:25:40,580
- You'd better get out of here.
- How come?

288
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:42,779
You're the one who followed Kate
this morning.

289
00:25:42,863 --> 00:25:45,252
- It's a free country, isn't it?
- It's a free country.

290
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:48,221
Only, Joe said if I saw you again,
I was supposed to tell him.

291
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:50,259
You can tell him if you want to.

292
00:25:51,303 --> 00:25:53,817
You're just a kid, ain't you?

293
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:57,411
- I'm older than you are.
- Yeah, sure, but that isn't...

294
00:25:57,503 --> 00:25:59,016
- Hey!
- All right.

295
00:26:00,623 --> 00:26:01,658
Kid, please...

296
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:04,177
you oughtn't to go around
throwing stones and things.

297
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,731
That isn't nice. And drinking beer.

298
00:26:08,863 --> 00:26:09,978
There's Joe.

299
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:14,140
Look, kid, please go.
You don't want to get yourself hurt.

300
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:18,094
You could tell him now, if you want to.
There's your chance.

301
00:26:19,383 --> 00:26:21,897
You sure have got a nerve, haven't you?

302
00:26:29,023 --> 00:26:32,015
- Do you know Kate?
- This is Kate's place.

303
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:35,095
- She's treating you okay?
- Sure.

304
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:36,855
I gotta go now, kid.

305
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:38,262
Is she nice?

306
00:26:38,743 --> 00:26:40,062
Don't let Joe see you, please.

307
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:42,373
She doesn't treat you rough
or anything, does she?

308
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:45,261
Please, kid, I gotta go now.
It was nice meeting you.

309
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:47,857
Isn't there anything nice about her at all?

310
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:50,461
What's the matter, kid?

311
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:53,817
- She had pretty hands. Did you see them?
- Hands?

312
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,972
Did you look at them?

313
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:58,180
No, I don't think I ever saw them.
She always wears gloves.

314
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:03,612
Where is she?

315
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:05,500
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

316
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,416
- Back in her office, probably.
- Where's that?

317
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:10,141
Back that way.

318
00:27:10,223 --> 00:27:11,497
Will you show me?

319
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:17,696
Look, kid, please don't start any trouble.

320
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:20,297
I'm not gonna start any trouble. Come on.

321
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:23,181
We<i>...</i> You can just point the door to me,
and I'll go there.

322
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:24,378
No, honest.

323
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:27,296
This is a tough place. I can't lose this job.

324
00:27:27,383 --> 00:27:29,738
- I'm not very good at it, anyway.
- You won't lose it.

325
00:27:29,823 --> 00:27:32,940
If I step out of line
Kate will throw me out on my ear.

326
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:36,132
Come on, will you?

327
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:38,453
You can just show me where the door is.

328
00:27:38,903 --> 00:27:40,052
Come on.

329
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,261
Be a sport.

330
00:27:46,383 --> 00:27:47,702
Come on.

331
00:28:01,543 --> 00:28:03,135
There's the door.

332
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:05,454
Thank you. You can go back now.

333
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:07,941
What are you gonna do?

334
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:10,937
Please, kid, don't make any trouble.

335
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:16,860
I'm not gonna make any trouble.
I'm gonna wait till you're gone. Okay?

336
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,655
Will you let me talk to you? Please.

337
00:29:12,423 --> 00:29:14,653
I gotta talk to you.

338
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:21,458
Joe!

339
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:25,658
Get out of here! Joe! Tex!

340
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,777
Call the sheriff! Get him out!

341
00:29:31,423 --> 00:29:34,779
Call the sheriff! Get him out of here!

342
00:29:37,263 --> 00:29:39,458
I want to talk to her!

343
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:50,213
I want to talk to you!

344
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,132
Please, talk to me!

345
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:57,659
Talk to me, please! Mother!

346
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:02,454
Is there any law against a guy
trying to see his own mother?

347
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,693
No, I guess there isn't.

348
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:06,612
Here.

349
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:09,661
Put this on your cheek. Here.

350
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,416
Drink some coffee.

351
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,974
How did you find out about Kate, anyway?

352
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:22,861
That guy I saw you talking to
in the bar the other night?

353
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:25,457
The one they call "Rabbit."

354
00:30:25,983 --> 00:30:29,134
I thought so. He never was any good.

355
00:30:29,223 --> 00:30:32,135
I remember when he used
to work on your father's ranch.

356
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:37,016
Well, he won't be around anymore, Cal.
He's left town for good.

357
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:42,701
- What do you hang around bars for?
- Any law against hanging...

358
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:45,013
Yes, there is! I'm the law.

359
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,061
Get that through your head.

360
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:49,856
Shut up!

361
00:30:55,783 --> 00:30:58,900
Does Adam know that you...

362
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,974
roam around over here at night?

363
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,100
Adam's an old friend of mine,
you know, Cal, from...

364
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:10,413
way back in his ranch days.

365
00:31:11,223 --> 00:31:14,533
I was afraid when you moved here
last year...

366
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:17,981
that you might find out something
about Kate.

367
00:31:19,023 --> 00:31:21,742
But then she was over here on the Bay...

368
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:25,020
and you were way over on the other side
of the mountains in Salinas.

369
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:28,937
- So I figured it'd be all right.
- You think he'll ever find out about her?

370
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:31,538
He'd never come over here.

371
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:38,340
Here. You might as well look at this now.

372
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:42,098
It's a picture of your father
and your mother on their wedding day.

373
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:45,457
You're the first person
I've ever showed it to.

374
00:31:50,463 --> 00:31:51,976
I knew it.

375
00:31:53,943 --> 00:31:55,740
I knew it was true.

376
00:31:57,943 --> 00:32:00,537
When that old guy told me in the bar,
I knew it.

377
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:05,414
How did you know it was true?

378
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:08,620
'Cause she ain't no good
and I ain't no good.

379
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:11,263
I knew there was a reason why I wasn't.

380
00:32:18,943 --> 00:32:20,058
I hate her.

381
00:32:20,423 --> 00:32:22,539
And I hate him, too.

382
00:32:23,783 --> 00:32:25,819
Come on, I'll take you home.

383
00:32:27,063 --> 00:32:30,817
- You don't have to drive me home!
- I know I don't have to take you home!

384
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:33,092
Here.

385
00:32:33,903 --> 00:32:36,542
A little bit of the hair
of the dog that bit you.

386
00:32:37,103 --> 00:32:38,218
Come on now.

387
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:53,015
How did Dad meet her?

388
00:32:54,303 --> 00:32:55,941
Where did she come from?

389
00:32:56,823 --> 00:32:59,257
Nobody ever knew
where she come from, really.

390
00:33:00,223 --> 00:33:03,260
There were a lot of drifters in those days.

391
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:05,777
Of all the people.

392
00:33:09,503 --> 00:33:11,095
How come he married her?

393
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:14,177
You have no idea how pretty she was, Cal.

394
00:33:14,263 --> 00:33:16,458
Young and full of spirit.

395
00:33:16,543 --> 00:33:19,137
And your father hadn't been
off the ranch much, you know.

396
00:33:19,223 --> 00:33:21,134
He's not a worldly man.

397
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:34,018
- Did she shoot him?
- Yes, she did.

398
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:37,062
How come?

399
00:33:38,503 --> 00:33:39,777
I don't know.

400
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:44,219
Did he do something to her?

401
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,695
- Did he hurt her?
- No.

402
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,860
It wasn't in him to hurt her.

403
00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:53,495
After she left him, he died.
He walked around, but he died.

404
00:33:56,863 --> 00:33:59,377
He must have done something to hurt her.

405
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:01,739
No. No, sir.

406
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:05,020
He gave her everything
that any woman could ask for.

407
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:10,498
You see, your father has more kindness...

408
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:15,062
and more conscience
than any man that I've ever known.

409
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,972
He's a good man, Cal.
Don't sell him short, boy.

410
00:34:54,023 --> 00:34:55,900
It's going to work.

411
00:34:55,983 --> 00:34:58,941
If only I can keep them
cold enough long enough.

412
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:10,496
It's going to work.

413
00:35:26,143 --> 00:35:29,260
All right, there she is. Let's try it.
Step back, girls.

414
00:35:37,063 --> 00:35:39,338
All right, bring her on. Come on.

415
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:44,495
Now do you think it'll work?

416
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:07,217
- Good morning, Mr. Trask.
- Good morning.

417
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:12,212
Somebody swiped our coal chute
right off the wagon.

418
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,692
Dear, dear.
Times are getting pretty lawless.

419
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:15,818
It's this war in Europe.

420
00:36:15,903 --> 00:36:19,339
There's a wave of lawlessness
spreading through the country.

421
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:21,254
Anyway, somebody swiped our chute.

422
00:36:21,343 --> 00:36:22,856
- Is that where you're loading?
- Yes.

423
00:36:22,943 --> 00:36:24,774
We'll move on, then. Good day, Mr. Trask.

424
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:26,455
It's this war in Europe.

425
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:41,781
Do you know where Aron is?

426
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:45,019
He's out in the fields. He's checking.

427
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:46,172
Can I do something for you?

428
00:36:46,263 --> 00:36:49,335
No. There were just some matters
I want to talk over with him.

429
00:36:49,423 --> 00:36:51,061
What have you got there?

430
00:36:51,863 --> 00:36:55,299
I figured it would save some time. So I<i>...</i>

431
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:58,932
It's very ingenious, Cal. Very ingenious.
Did you think of it?

432
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:00,581
Yep.

433
00:37:00,663 --> 00:37:03,018
I'm very pleased
with the way you're taking hold...

434
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:04,695
and are working so well, Cal.

435
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:06,455
Thanks. Thanks, Dad.

436
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:14,575
Think you better have your lunch now.
It's time.

437
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:17,978
Hi, Cal.

438
00:37:20,143 --> 00:37:22,737
- Aron's out in the field.
- I brought his lunch.

439
00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:26,537
- Okay, I'll take it to him.
- Cal.

440
00:37:38,143 --> 00:37:40,134
Lydia, vamoose.

441
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:54,811
He'll be here in a minute.

442
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:58,452
I've been fixing Aron's lunch.
I'll fix yours, too, if you like, after this.

443
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,056
No, thanks.

444
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:04,179
Would you be eating with her
if I weren't here?

445
00:38:04,263 --> 00:38:05,252
Who?

446
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:11,058
No, I didn't ask her to come up here.

447
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:16,899
Girls follow you around, don't they?

448
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:19,861
- Does she bother you?
- She doesn't bother me.

449
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:21,812
Who is she?

450
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:26,453
I never saw her before in my life.

451
00:38:28,023 --> 00:38:29,251
I'll bet.

452
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:35,055
You're really working
at this lettuce business, aren't you, Cal?

453
00:38:35,543 --> 00:38:37,261
Do you think it'll turn out all right?

454
00:38:37,343 --> 00:38:39,982
Your father will lose quite a lot of money
if it doesn't.

455
00:38:40,063 --> 00:38:41,655
Just about all he's got.

456
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:44,259
I like your father.

457
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:46,418
Do you?

458
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:53,577
I threw away about $3,000 once.

459
00:38:54,183 --> 00:38:55,138
Yeah?

460
00:38:56,663 --> 00:38:58,654
- When I was 13.
- You threw it away?

461
00:38:58,743 --> 00:39:00,461
It was a diamond ring worth about that.

462
00:39:00,543 --> 00:39:03,011
At least, my father told me
that's what he paid for it.

463
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:06,379
I threw it in the river.
Made Dad terribly angry.

464
00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:10,295
I reckon it would.

465
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:12,977
But I forgave him.
And it's been all right ever since.

466
00:39:13,063 --> 00:39:14,542
- You forgave him?
- Yes.

467
00:39:17,223 --> 00:39:20,772
You forgave him 'cause you threw
a ring of his worth $3,000 into the river?

468
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:22,421
- That's right.
- And you forgave him?

469
00:39:22,503 --> 00:39:24,061
That's right.

470
00:39:24,143 --> 00:39:26,179
Is there an egg in this basket?

471
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:31,213
You see, I thought he didn't love me.
That made me feel awful.

472
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,898
Girls love their fathers terribly.

473
00:39:35,463 --> 00:39:36,691
Do they?

474
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:39,581
My mother died when I was 13...

475
00:39:39,663 --> 00:39:42,735
and Dad got married again soon after that.
Did you know that?

476
00:39:42,823 --> 00:39:44,700
No, I didn't know that.

477
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:47,899
Are you interested in hearing about me?

478
00:39:47,983 --> 00:39:49,018
Yeah.

479
00:39:52,663 --> 00:39:55,973
When Dad got married again,
it made me sick.

480
00:39:56,983 --> 00:39:58,621
I just hated everybody.

481
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:01,413
I used to sit and just glare at people...

482
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:04,176
or I wouldn't even answer
when they spoke to me.

483
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:09,135
- Why you telling me all this?
- I want to.

484
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:13,053
I was that way for months.
I just hated everybody.

485
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:15,373
I thought nobody in the world loved me.

486
00:40:17,263 --> 00:40:19,413
And it was awful.

487
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:24,381
Then I found this ring
that Dad gave my new mother...

488
00:40:25,743 --> 00:40:28,382
- so I took it and threw it in the river.
- Good.

489
00:40:29,823 --> 00:40:31,541
I thought you'd like that.

490
00:40:32,943 --> 00:40:34,695
- Did he ever find it?
- Never.

491
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:38,216
They tried.

492
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:40,736
What'd they do to you?

493
00:40:40,823 --> 00:40:43,542
Dad punished me. Not badly, I guess.

494
00:40:43,623 --> 00:40:46,137
But I felt
he shouldn't have punished me at all.

495
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:49,579
I felt he should have loved me more
because I did it.

496
00:40:49,983 --> 00:40:51,177
But he didn't.

497
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,019
Isn't it funny?

498
00:40:54,903 --> 00:40:56,780
I'm grown up now...

499
00:40:56,863 --> 00:40:59,331
but I still understand kids better
than I do grownups.

500
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,538
You're not so grown<i>- u</i>p.

501
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:02,773
- I'm very grown<i>- u</i>p.
- That's a matter of opinion.

502
00:41:02,863 --> 00:41:04,296
I'm very grown<i>- u</i>p.

503
00:41:04,383 --> 00:41:07,739
More so than Dad, because I forgave him
for not understanding.

504
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,732
And the minute I forgave him in my mind...

505
00:41:13,423 --> 00:41:14,936
I felt better.

506
00:41:22,143 --> 00:41:23,815
Now we get along fine.

507
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:28,697
We love each other.
Not like we did when I was 13...

508
00:41:28,783 --> 00:41:31,661
but enough so we can live together
till I get married.

509
00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:38,619
He's just my father now.
Nothing to rave about.

510
00:41:39,423 --> 00:41:42,460
I still don't like her much,
but then, she's a woman.

511
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:57,780
My, that girl just hates me, doesn't she?

512
00:41:58,703 --> 00:42:00,933
You better tell her I'm your brother's girl.

513
00:42:01,023 --> 00:42:03,617
I don't have to explain anything
to anybody.

514
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,738
I'll go now and leave the field to her.

515
00:42:12,623 --> 00:42:14,659
My, your hair's in a mess.

516
00:42:18,143 --> 00:42:19,974
Dad, what's that?

517
00:42:20,063 --> 00:42:23,260
That's something Cal rigged up.
It's a good idea.

518
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:25,413
Aron! I brought your lunch.

519
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:28,378
Looks like a coal chute.

520
00:42:28,703 --> 00:42:30,421
Coal chute?

521
00:42:33,743 --> 00:42:35,335
Okay, woman, where's the beans?

522
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:36,378
Cal!

523
00:42:38,983 --> 00:42:42,612
What makes you think you have the right
to come and take something like this?

524
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:45,900
You probably lost those men their jobs.
Now, you take it back.

525
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:56,340
He's praising Cal and Cal is lapping it up.

526
00:42:56,423 --> 00:42:58,937
Aron! Look, have one of those
made of wood.

527
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:01,218
- It'll save a lot of time.
- Yes, sir!

528
00:43:04,463 --> 00:43:06,613
- Good waste of time and money.
- And lettuce.

529
00:43:06,703 --> 00:43:09,740
- What'd you say?
- I said, it's a good idea if it works.

530
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:12,178
It's gonna work, 'cause it's gotta work.

531
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:14,299
It's gotta work, 'cause I said so.

532
00:43:16,223 --> 00:43:18,214
If it don't work, it ain't that kid's fault.

533
00:43:18,303 --> 00:43:20,533
I never saw anybody work
so hard in my life.

534
00:43:23,863 --> 00:43:26,297
Let's go, Pete. Now, Leonard!

535
00:43:29,223 --> 00:43:31,453
Good luck, Adam.

536
00:44:03,623 --> 00:44:06,501
Do you know the principle
of the internal combustion engine?

537
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:09,017
No, I'm afraid not.
Will, I'll never be able to...

538
00:44:09,103 --> 00:44:11,094
Sure you will. You just listen to Roy.

539
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:13,333
He's been to the automobile school
in Chicago.

540
00:44:13,423 --> 00:44:16,221
Mr. Trask has just revolutionized
the entire vegetable market.

541
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:18,897
- Wait till those cars get to New York.
- Don't you worry.

542
00:44:18,983 --> 00:44:20,974
It's about time he owned
his own automobile...

543
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:22,735
and about time he learned to drive it.

544
00:44:22,823 --> 00:44:25,257
- Now don't you think so, Roy?
- I'll do my best.

545
00:44:25,343 --> 00:44:27,254
Now pay strict attention, boys.

546
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:29,298
Don't touch that!

547
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:30,941
Wait till it's explained to you.

548
00:44:31,023 --> 00:44:33,935
No, now for heaven's sake,
don't touch anything, anybody.

549
00:44:34,743 --> 00:44:37,621
The power of the explosion
is exerted on a piston...

550
00:44:37,703 --> 00:44:41,173
and through connecting rod
and crankshaft...

551
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:44,938
through transmission,
thence to rear wheels.

552
00:44:45,023 --> 00:44:47,617
- Got that so far?
- Sure, he's got that.

553
00:44:47,703 --> 00:44:50,615
Now, we go on
to the operation of the automobile.

554
00:44:51,703 --> 00:44:53,534
This here's the ignition key.

555
00:44:54,423 --> 00:44:57,142
Would you mind putting out
that cigarette, please.

556
00:44:57,223 --> 00:45:00,260
Turn this doohickey here to the left.
That puts her on battery.

557
00:45:00,343 --> 00:45:02,299
- See where it says "bat"?
- Yes.

558
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:05,693
- Bat, short for battery.
- That's right. Good boy.

559
00:45:06,143 --> 00:45:07,576
Thank you. Thank you very much.

560
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,142
First you gotta retard the spark.

561
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:12,772
If you don't retard the spark,
she'll probably kick your blasted arm off.

562
00:45:12,863 --> 00:45:14,376
Now remember that.

563
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,016
This here is the spark.

564
00:45:16,103 --> 00:45:19,220
You push her way up. Listen.

565
00:45:20,623 --> 00:45:23,535
- This here's the gas. You push her...
- Down.

566
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:27,460
- You had lessons before.
- No, I just saw you do it.

567
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:31,022
- You're a pretty smart old buzzard.
- Thank you very much.

568
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,492
- Keep your eyes open, don't you?
- Try to.

569
00:45:34,103 --> 00:45:35,821
Now, this here is the crank.

570
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:38,975
See this wire sticking out of the radiator?
That's the choke.

571
00:45:39,063 --> 00:45:41,782
Now watch careful.
Grab hold of the crank like this.

572
00:45:41,863 --> 00:45:43,262
Push in till she catches.

573
00:45:43,343 --> 00:45:44,776
See how my thumb is turned down?

574
00:45:44,863 --> 00:45:46,342
I noticed that. Why do you do that?

575
00:45:46,423 --> 00:45:49,142
If you put her around this way
with my thumb around her...

576
00:45:49,223 --> 00:45:51,134
she'd probably knock
my blasted thumb off.

577
00:45:51,223 --> 00:45:55,057
Dear, dear. First you lose your blasted arm
and then you lose your blasted thumb.

578
00:45:55,143 --> 00:45:57,134
- That's kind of wrong way around.
- How's that?

579
00:45:57,223 --> 00:46:00,340
He made a joke.
I never did see him so happy.

580
00:46:00,823 --> 00:46:03,781
You pull out this choke
turn her around to suck gas in.

581
00:46:04,383 --> 00:46:06,339
Then you give her a hard spin.

582
00:46:06,703 --> 00:46:09,820
- She caught, first time!
- Caught on what?

583
00:46:10,623 --> 00:46:12,375
Advance the spark and retard the gas.

584
00:46:12,463 --> 00:46:15,023
Reach over real quick and switch
to mag. That's magneto.

585
00:46:15,103 --> 00:46:16,900
So, there you are.

586
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,417
Isn't that wonderful?

587
00:46:19,503 --> 00:46:21,937
Of course, it isn't exactly
going anywhere, is it?

588
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:23,012
That's the easy part.

589
00:46:23,103 --> 00:46:24,900
- Adam.
- I want you all to repeat after me.

590
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:27,451
Spark up, gas down.

591
00:46:27,543 --> 00:46:28,862
Switch to bat.

592
00:46:28,943 --> 00:46:31,582
Crank to compression, thumb down.

593
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,540
You get that? Let's have it again.

594
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:35,614
Spark up, gas down.

595
00:46:35,703 --> 00:46:37,819
- What's the matter?
- Big snow slide.

596
00:46:37,903 --> 00:46:40,736
Closed the pass and stopped the cars
about 100 miles out.

597
00:46:40,823 --> 00:46:43,417
Can see water running out of the cars.

598
00:46:55,823 --> 00:46:58,735
It's still a good idea.
Cold can preserve things.

599
00:46:58,823 --> 00:47:00,654
Someday, somebody'll prove it.

600
00:47:02,423 --> 00:47:04,698
- It was your idea.
- No!

601
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:07,502
It was presumptuous of me
to think it would be I.

602
00:47:09,503 --> 00:47:12,222
Guess we bit off more lettuce
than we could chew.

603
00:47:13,903 --> 00:47:17,259
What do you know about that?
I thought he'd really be hurt.

604
00:47:18,623 --> 00:47:20,818
You don't understand him.

605
00:47:21,903 --> 00:47:24,053
- You can't go in there.
- I gotta see Will Hamilton.

606
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:26,452
He won't be through for an hour.
They just started.

607
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,534
- Let me see him.
- There's a war in Europe.

608
00:47:28,623 --> 00:47:31,501
These boys are trying
to get themselves in shape. So beat it.

609
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,062
Right, left.

610
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:48,535
Now, deep knee bends, follow me.

611
00:48:00,863 --> 00:48:02,581
- What's that?
- That's the fire bell.

612
00:48:02,663 --> 00:48:04,255
We better have a look.

613
00:48:06,343 --> 00:48:09,699
- It may be the Germans.
- Fire, Germans, who cares? I surrender.

614
00:48:11,463 --> 00:48:12,976
- Howdy, Mr. Albrecht.
- Hello, Cal.

615
00:48:13,063 --> 00:48:14,860
- Mr. Hamilton.
- There's a fire somewhere.

616
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:16,376
- No. I rang the bell.
- You rang it?

617
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:17,452
Yeah. I had to see you.

618
00:48:17,543 --> 00:48:19,420
You know, you're crazy.
You're really crazy.

619
00:48:19,503 --> 00:48:21,733
I knew it when you pushed that ice
down the chute.

620
00:48:21,863 --> 00:48:24,616
Let's get out of here
before they start up that piano again.

621
00:48:24,703 --> 00:48:27,854
There must be some easier way
to stop the Germans than this, anyway.

622
00:48:27,943 --> 00:48:31,333
- You see, I gotta make some money.
- Sure, everybody's got to.

623
00:48:32,703 --> 00:48:35,775
Remember, you said that
if you wanna make money...

624
00:48:35,863 --> 00:48:37,091
you ought to raise beans?

625
00:48:37,183 --> 00:48:39,333
Yeah, beans are up 3.5 cents now.

626
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,573
Now, the way I figure it, it's like you said.

627
00:48:41,663 --> 00:48:43,733
The country's gonna get into war, isn't it?

628
00:48:43,823 --> 00:48:45,620
I don't see any way out.

629
00:48:45,703 --> 00:48:49,059
- War's good for business.
- The best there is.

630
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:52,499
See, that's why I wanna go into beans.

631
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:56,379
See, I gotta get enough money
to give my father back what he lost.

632
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,496
I see.

633
00:49:00,543 --> 00:49:02,693
You think you can make
all that money back?

634
00:49:02,783 --> 00:49:04,102
I gotta.

635
00:49:04,183 --> 00:49:06,014
You know, you're crazy.

636
00:49:06,503 --> 00:49:08,698
Look, Cal, don't you know...

637
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:11,456
that you gotta have money
in order to make money?

638
00:49:11,863 --> 00:49:13,774
- I'll get some money.
- How?

639
00:49:14,543 --> 00:49:15,658
I'll get it.

640
00:49:16,223 --> 00:49:19,579
Look, don't get so near to me.
I don't wanna get all hot again.

641
00:49:19,663 --> 00:49:22,416
- How much money could you get?
- What do you think I need?

642
00:49:22,503 --> 00:49:24,573
If you had $5,000<i>...</i>

643
00:49:28,743 --> 00:49:30,017
$5,000?

644
00:49:30,743 --> 00:49:34,622
It's a little different when you start
putting it into figures, isn't it?

645
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,901
I know you wanna help your father...

646
00:49:38,983 --> 00:49:41,975
but a kid your age can't be expected
to put his hands on $5,000.

647
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:45,533
Maybe if you could raise $100 or so,
we could let you have a little share.

648
00:49:45,623 --> 00:49:47,978
I don't want a little share,
I want the whole thing.

649
00:49:48,063 --> 00:49:50,736
- I'll get $5,000.
- Maybe if you and Aron went in together...

650
00:49:50,823 --> 00:49:53,383
Aron ain't got nothing to do with this.
This is my deal.

651
00:49:53,463 --> 00:49:54,452
I'll get the $5,000.

652
00:49:54,543 --> 00:49:56,454
What're you gonna do, borrow it?

653
00:49:58,703 --> 00:49:59,658
Yeah.

654
00:50:00,783 --> 00:50:02,978
All right. If you can borrow $5,000...

655
00:50:03,063 --> 00:50:05,702
I know a farmer who's got over 800 acres.

656
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:08,581
- It's under cultivation.
- All right. What do we do?

657
00:50:09,143 --> 00:50:11,862
If we can guarantee him 5 cents a pound...

658
00:50:11,943 --> 00:50:14,298
and make him a seed loan,
he'll plant beans.

659
00:50:14,383 --> 00:50:15,782
So will a lot of other farmers.

660
00:50:15,863 --> 00:50:18,616
Why, we can contract
all the bean acreage you want.

661
00:50:20,503 --> 00:50:23,859
That's it. That's great. When do we start?

662
00:50:24,783 --> 00:50:27,138
How do you know the price
will go above 5, though?

663
00:50:27,263 --> 00:50:29,060
Did you read the newspapers
this morning?

664
00:50:29,143 --> 00:50:31,293
We're apt to be in war any minute.

665
00:50:31,383 --> 00:50:34,932
You know I got a contract
with the British Purchasing Agency...

666
00:50:35,023 --> 00:50:37,253
and I got a friend in
the Quartermaster Corps.

667
00:50:37,343 --> 00:50:39,652
Do you know
that we could sell all the dry beans...

668
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,813
that we can find
at 10 cents a pound or more?

669
00:50:41,903 --> 00:50:44,576
That's what I want. That's it. See?

670
00:50:45,383 --> 00:50:47,738
- How much will I make?
- Enough for what you want.

671
00:51:34,303 --> 00:51:36,897
- What does Cal stand for?
- Caleb.

672
00:51:37,783 --> 00:51:39,375
It's in the Bible.

673
00:51:41,983 --> 00:51:44,451
- What's your brother's name?
- Aron.

674
00:51:45,543 --> 00:51:47,215
That's in the Bible, too.

675
00:51:51,303 --> 00:51:52,577
What's he like?

676
00:51:54,663 --> 00:51:56,494
He looks like you.

677
00:51:58,623 --> 00:52:00,181
Is he like me?

678
00:52:00,263 --> 00:52:02,254
No. He's good.

679
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,576
I'm more like you.

680
00:52:11,263 --> 00:52:12,582
How's Adam?

681
00:52:13,343 --> 00:52:14,776
How's your father?

682
00:52:16,343 --> 00:52:18,140
I don't wanna talk about him.

683
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,732
- You don't?
- No.

684
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:39,336
I didn't know who you were
when you were here before.

685
00:52:39,903 --> 00:52:41,655
I knew you didn't.

686
00:52:45,303 --> 00:52:47,419
Aren't you afraid
to come around here again?

687
00:52:47,503 --> 00:52:49,937
Yeah, I am. No. Well, kind of.

688
00:52:54,703 --> 00:52:56,056
What do you want?

689
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:00,180
Just to look at me?

690
00:53:05,503 --> 00:53:07,334
I want $5,000.

691
00:53:20,183 --> 00:53:22,697
All right, come on in. Sit down.

692
00:53:23,383 --> 00:53:24,498
Come in.

693
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:27,377
Try that chair.

694
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:31,901
You got your father's eyes.

695
00:53:33,063 --> 00:53:35,099
That's all I can see of him.

696
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:39,261
- You're a nice looking boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

697
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:45,817
- I was very beautiful once.
- Yes, ma'am.

698
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:51,695
Caleb and Aron.

699
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,776
Your father still thinks
he's living in the Bible, huh?

700
00:53:54,863 --> 00:53:56,182
Them's just names.

701
00:53:56,703 --> 00:53:59,217
Joe says that you go to school in Salinas.

702
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:01,134
Are you good in your studies?

703
00:54:02,903 --> 00:54:04,780
I get by with them.

704
00:54:04,863 --> 00:54:06,774
Does Aron get by with them?

705
00:54:06,863 --> 00:54:07,978
He's bright.

706
00:54:09,223 --> 00:54:12,579
What are you gonna do when you finish?
You're going to college?

707
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:14,418
Maybe.

708
00:54:14,863 --> 00:54:17,696
Or back to some ranch?

709
00:54:17,783 --> 00:54:20,502
No, I don't like the ranch.

710
00:54:21,423 --> 00:54:23,061
You take after me.

711
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,099
Makes me mad just to think about a ranch.

712
00:54:28,743 --> 00:54:29,971
Sit down.

713
00:54:34,663 --> 00:54:35,618
Thanks.

714
00:54:42,743 --> 00:54:44,938
What do you want with $5,000?

715
00:54:45,663 --> 00:54:47,335
I want to go into business.

716
00:54:47,423 --> 00:54:50,620
- You're a little young for that, aren't you?
- I'm old enough.

717
00:54:51,103 --> 00:54:53,537
Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess you are.

718
00:54:54,263 --> 00:54:56,697
- What business do you wanna go into?
- Beans.

719
00:54:59,703 --> 00:55:02,342
Beans are up to 3.5 cents now.

720
00:55:02,423 --> 00:55:04,937
And if we get into war,
they're gonna go up to 10, 12.

721
00:55:05,023 --> 00:55:07,696
- Lf we get into the war.
- That's a gamble you have to take.

722
00:55:07,783 --> 00:55:09,819
- Will Hamilton says that...
- Will?

723
00:55:09,903 --> 00:55:12,133
You going into business
with Will Hamilton?

724
00:55:12,223 --> 00:55:13,542
You see...

725
00:55:15,423 --> 00:55:18,779
my father, he lost about all he had in...

726
00:55:18,863 --> 00:55:21,741
Yeah, I know. I heard about that.

727
00:55:23,343 --> 00:55:26,301
I wanna make enough to pay him back.

728
00:55:27,103 --> 00:55:30,254
What's the matter with him?
Can't he make any money?

729
00:55:30,343 --> 00:55:31,253
Yeah.

730
00:55:33,943 --> 00:55:34,898
Only<i>...</i>

731
00:55:36,223 --> 00:55:39,579
Only he's too good to bother with money.

732
00:55:42,783 --> 00:55:43,738
Okay.

733
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,101
What makes you think I'd give you $5,000?

734
00:55:55,663 --> 00:55:57,654
I don't know who else to ask.

735
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:01,740
You got a lot of nerve coming to me.

736
00:56:01,823 --> 00:56:04,576
Why? I didn't do anything to you.

737
00:56:10,103 --> 00:56:12,298
It's a good business venture.

738
00:56:15,223 --> 00:56:17,862
I'll pay you back. I'll give you interest.

739
00:56:17,943 --> 00:56:20,503
You're a business woman, ain't you?

740
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:22,016
One of the best, Son.

741
00:56:23,263 --> 00:56:27,893
You know, Sam told me that you think
I ought to be run out of town.

742
00:56:31,063 --> 00:56:34,976
You're afraid that your father and Aron
might find out about me, is that it?

743
00:56:38,823 --> 00:56:40,939
This $5,000, now.

744
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:43,742
That wouldn't be
any kind of blackmail, would it?

745
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:45,495
I never thought about that.

746
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:48,692
But now that you do, it's a good idea, huh?

747
00:56:50,063 --> 00:56:52,019
- I guess, maybe.
- It's not.

748
00:56:56,143 --> 00:56:59,499
Anyway, I'm not gonna hurt
your precious father or your brother.

749
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,378
- Do they know anything about me?
- No.

750
00:57:02,703 --> 00:57:04,773
Father thinks you're in the East...

751
00:57:06,063 --> 00:57:07,860
and Aron thinks you're dead.

752
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:12,691
Then, there's no reason to think
that they ever will find out about me.

753
00:57:12,783 --> 00:57:15,820
We don't exactly move in the same circles.

754
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:23,641
What are you staring at?

755
00:57:25,523 --> 00:57:26,956
How come you did it?

756
00:57:27,923 --> 00:57:28,878
Did what?

757
00:57:30,563 --> 00:57:31,757
Shot my father?

758
00:57:32,603 --> 00:57:34,958
Did he tell you that?

759
00:57:37,683 --> 00:57:40,481
How come you ran away from all of us?
How come you shot him?

760
00:57:40,563 --> 00:57:43,760
- Ran away and did all that kind of stuff?
- None of your business.

761
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:47,358
I shot him because he tried to stop me.

762
00:57:48,283 --> 00:57:50,797
I could have killed him if I'd wanted to,
but I didn't.

763
00:57:50,883 --> 00:57:53,033
I just wanted him to let me go.

764
00:57:53,683 --> 00:57:57,039
- Why?
- Because he tried to hold me.

765
00:57:58,723 --> 00:57:59,917
He wanted to tie me down.

766
00:58:00,003 --> 00:58:02,517
He wanted to keep me
on a stinking little ranch...

767
00:58:02,603 --> 00:58:04,753
away from everybody.
Keep me all to himself.

768
00:58:04,843 --> 00:58:06,959
Nobody holds me.

769
00:58:07,523 --> 00:58:09,400
- But he loved you.
- Love.

770
00:58:11,043 --> 00:58:12,920
He wanted to own me.

771
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:16,037
He wanted to bring me up
like a snot-nosed kid...

772
00:58:16,123 --> 00:58:19,672
and tell me what to do.
Nobody tells me what to do.

773
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:24,320
Always so right himself.
Knowing everything.

774
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:27,119
Reading the Bible at me.

775
00:58:27,923 --> 00:58:30,153
- What are you grinning at?
- Nothing.

776
00:58:31,483 --> 00:58:33,678
Maybe you know what I'm talking about?

777
00:58:34,883 --> 00:58:36,555
Always so right himself?

778
00:58:37,163 --> 00:58:38,357
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

779
00:58:39,843 --> 00:58:42,960
Maybe like you said out there,
maybe you are more like me.

780
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:47,995
Yeah, you got sense.

781
00:58:48,523 --> 00:58:51,640
Maybe you don't fall for that slop
any more than I do.

782
00:58:51,723 --> 00:58:55,318
Maybe you know what people
are really like. What they want.

783
00:58:55,403 --> 00:58:58,361
I got the toughest house on the coast...

784
00:58:58,443 --> 00:59:00,673
and the finest clientele.

785
00:59:02,763 --> 00:59:05,197
Half the stinking city hall go there.

786
00:59:06,723 --> 00:59:08,315
They sneak in at night...

787
00:59:08,403 --> 00:59:11,201
and I walk in this front door
in the daytime, see.

788
00:59:12,043 --> 00:59:13,920
And I built it up from nothing.

789
00:59:15,123 --> 00:59:17,239
Now you want $5,000 of my money...

790
00:59:17,323 --> 00:59:20,042
to go into business
to pay your father back what he lost.

791
00:59:20,243 --> 00:59:21,676
You know, that's funny.

792
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:25,282
I don't think he'll know where I got it.

793
00:59:25,363 --> 00:59:27,638
No, but it's funny just the same.

794
00:59:28,483 --> 00:59:29,836
Your father.

795
00:59:30,563 --> 00:59:32,838
He's the purest man there is, isn't he?

796
00:59:33,963 --> 00:59:37,194
He thought he had me all tied up
with his purity.

797
00:59:37,843 --> 00:59:40,994
And now I give you $5,000
of the money that I made...

798
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:43,233
to save him his purity.

799
00:59:44,043 --> 00:59:47,353
If you don't think that's funny,
you'd better not go to college.

800
00:59:56,763 --> 00:59:57,718
Okay.

801
01:00:01,683 --> 01:00:03,878
Tell Will Hamilton to come and see me.

802
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:08,075
He's a good businessman.

803
01:00:11,323 --> 01:00:14,838
How'd he ever happen to let you go
into this bean business, anyway?

804
01:00:15,323 --> 01:00:16,517
I don't know.

805
01:00:18,003 --> 01:00:20,039
I do. Maybe he likes you.

806
01:00:21,203 --> 01:00:22,158
Maybe.

807
01:00:24,963 --> 01:00:26,919
You're a likeable kid.

808
01:00:35,963 --> 01:00:37,681
You give this to him.

809
01:00:39,043 --> 01:00:41,921
If he wants to gamble
that we get into the war...

810
01:00:42,003 --> 01:00:43,322
it's okay with me.

811
01:01:02,123 --> 01:01:03,636
You're a likeable kid.

812
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:12,914
Go on, get out of here.

813
01:01:15,643 --> 01:01:18,111
Go on, get out. I'm running a business.

814
01:01:59,043 --> 01:02:00,920
- Them Germans can't fight.
- No.

815
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:28,432
Hi, partner.

816
01:02:28,963 --> 01:02:31,921
Every day in every way,
we're getting richer and richer.

817
01:02:36,683 --> 01:02:37,798
Kaiser.

818
01:02:37,883 --> 01:02:41,034
All we have to do is call his bluff.
He'll come to heel like a dog.

819
01:02:47,043 --> 01:02:50,831
We'll be there to clean up this mess
for those foreigners in a couple of weeks.

820
01:03:05,683 --> 01:03:07,241
Cal, stop it.

821
01:03:09,283 --> 01:03:10,398
There's Cal.

822
01:03:16,003 --> 01:03:18,722
- Hi, boy. Hey, want some?
- Hello, Cal.

823
01:03:19,243 --> 01:03:20,198
Thanks.

824
01:03:28,563 --> 01:03:32,442
Your own Woodrow Wilson said you gotta
make the country safe for democracy.

825
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:34,959
- Didn't he say that?
- Yes, he said that.

826
01:03:35,043 --> 01:03:36,112
Will you go?

827
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:38,194
I think the war will be over. I don't think...

828
01:03:38,283 --> 01:03:41,753
If you believe in all this, why don't you?
If you really think it's right.

829
01:03:41,843 --> 01:03:43,401
I didn't say it was right, Aron.

830
01:03:43,483 --> 01:03:45,394
No, I guess you didn't.

831
01:03:47,643 --> 01:03:49,998
Why don't you go back
and join the parade?

832
01:03:56,043 --> 01:03:59,479
Nothing'll ever make me go. Nothing.

833
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,073
I just don't believe it's right.

834
01:04:19,243 --> 01:04:21,393
- Did you water them good?
- Sure, lots of water.

835
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:23,599
- Not too much, though.
- No, just right.

836
01:04:41,163 --> 01:04:43,961
Marty Hopps got a telegram today.
His boy was killed.

837
01:04:44,043 --> 01:04:46,034
I remember the day we sent him off.

838
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:51,122
A lot of troop ships have sunk
they don't tell us about.

839
01:04:51,203 --> 01:04:53,637
- It's gonna be a long war.
- Those Germans got an army.

840
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,361
They're a military nation.

841
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:57,714
Go back where you came from, German!

842
01:04:57,803 --> 01:04:59,361
Go on home, German!

843
01:05:06,563 --> 01:05:07,837
This is just the start.

844
01:05:07,923 --> 01:05:10,232
That rock through the window
is just the beginning.

845
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:11,995
The German people don't want this war.

846
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:14,722
And the stories they tell
of what the Germans are doing...

847
01:05:14,803 --> 01:05:16,794
it simply is not true. Not the good ones.

848
01:05:16,883 --> 01:05:20,080
I've been wondering lately
if we shouldn't all go back to the ranch.

849
01:05:20,163 --> 01:05:22,358
You can't get away from it there, Dad.

850
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:26,439
I don't know, somehow, on a ranch,
I don't know<i>...</i>

851
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:29,879
War seems to be
city people's business somehow.

852
01:05:31,123 --> 01:05:34,035
Farmers. What's a farmer got to do
with war?

853
01:05:35,963 --> 01:05:37,191
You tired, Dad?

854
01:05:38,763 --> 01:05:42,119
My eyes, I guess.
I work too hard at the Draft Board.

855
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:46,674
Better have my glasses looked at,
see if they're all right.

856
01:05:49,203 --> 01:05:52,001
I had a look at the bank account
the other day...

857
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:54,597
not much left after my great fiasco.

858
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,876
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

859
01:05:59,963 --> 01:06:01,954
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

860
01:06:05,403 --> 01:06:07,234
Let's don't worry about money.

861
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:18,081
Hey, Rantani!

862
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:20,995
Ain't this some sight?

863
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:22,482
Beans!

864
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:25,160
Yeah, boy, some beans.

865
01:06:25,243 --> 01:06:27,837
You come here everyday, boy,
what do you think...

866
01:06:27,923 --> 01:06:29,914
you gonna make them grow quicker?

867
01:06:39,003 --> 01:06:40,231
He's crazy.

868
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:50,000
Hey, where have you been?

869
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:52,802
Come on.

870
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:54,760
We're gonna have lots of fun tonight.

871
01:07:06,403 --> 01:07:08,792
- You won another cigar.
- Wait a minute.

872
01:07:10,043 --> 01:07:12,603
You wanna try one? No?

873
01:07:15,283 --> 01:07:16,511
Pick up my cigar.

874
01:07:16,603 --> 01:07:18,878
- I'm waiting for somebody.
- You're waiting for me.

875
01:07:18,963 --> 01:07:19,952
No, I'm not.

876
01:07:20,043 --> 01:07:22,034
Why don't you let me
take you for a nice ride?

877
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:24,762
If you don't stop bothering me,
I'll have to call someone.

878
01:07:24,843 --> 01:07:26,720
- Hello, Cal.
- What's the matter?

879
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:30,040
I was trying to tell this gentleman
that I was waiting for somebody.

880
01:07:30,123 --> 01:07:32,956
This is a lousy place
to keep your girlfriend waiting for you.

881
01:07:33,043 --> 01:07:34,840
- Sir, it won't happen again.
- I hope not.

882
01:07:34,923 --> 01:07:37,642
Lots of lousy characters around here.
Sorry, miss.

883
01:07:38,523 --> 01:07:39,842
Here I am, lady.

884
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:43,673
That's the first time
that ever happened to me.

885
01:07:43,763 --> 01:07:46,357
- What're you doing out here?
- I'm meeting Aron.

886
01:07:46,443 --> 01:07:49,276
I thought I'd come out early
and look around.

887
01:07:49,363 --> 01:07:52,719
- You never been out here before?
- Not at night, no.

888
01:07:53,963 --> 01:07:55,760
- What time you gonna meet him?
- At 8:00.

889
01:07:55,843 --> 01:07:58,835
Thought I'd try and cheer him up.
He's been so depressed lately.

890
01:07:58,923 --> 01:07:59,912
Yeah, I know.

891
01:08:00,003 --> 01:08:02,073
I'm so glad you happened to be here.

892
01:08:07,803 --> 01:08:08,758
8:00?

893
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,516
You got a half hour?

894
01:08:16,203 --> 01:08:18,398
How are you, Cal?
We never see you around anymore.

895
01:08:18,483 --> 01:08:19,518
I'm around.

896
01:08:19,603 --> 01:08:22,800
I've been over to the house several times,
but you were never there.

897
01:08:22,883 --> 01:08:26,080
- I never go home anymore.
- Aron says he hardly ever sees you.

898
01:08:27,363 --> 01:08:29,194
I feel awfully sorry for him.

899
01:08:34,843 --> 01:08:37,038
You're terrible.

900
01:08:37,123 --> 01:08:39,876
That's the first time
that ever happened to me, too.

901
01:08:41,043 --> 01:08:43,159
Wonder if we can see Aron from here.

902
01:08:44,243 --> 01:08:46,837
I feel awfully sorry for him.
He's right, you know.

903
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:49,915
I mean, it's awful, the war and people
killing each other.

904
01:08:50,003 --> 01:08:52,722
Why feel sorry for Aron?
Feel sorry for the people.

905
01:08:52,803 --> 01:08:55,363
But it just seems to affect him
so personally.

906
01:08:55,443 --> 01:08:57,274
I'll agree with that.

907
01:08:58,443 --> 01:08:59,637
He's right.

908
01:09:00,923 --> 01:09:02,641
He's always right.

909
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:04,719
And he has always been right.

910
01:09:04,803 --> 01:09:06,475
Now let's talk about something else.

911
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:07,598
All right.

912
01:09:09,163 --> 01:09:10,232
8:00.

913
01:09:10,523 --> 01:09:12,036
We got a lot to see.

914
01:09:13,203 --> 01:09:15,194
Will we be back in time for Aron?

915
01:09:18,563 --> 01:09:20,201
All right. I'd love to.

916
01:09:27,643 --> 01:09:28,598
Easy.

917
01:09:52,243 --> 01:09:55,599
Here's your cigar,
and where have you been hiding?

918
01:09:58,963 --> 01:10:00,191
- Who was that?
- Who?

919
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:02,319
- That girl.
- I don't see nobody.

920
01:10:02,403 --> 01:10:06,032
She was standing right<i>...</i>
Girls follow you around, don't they?

921
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:09,639
What are girls like that like?

922
01:10:10,203 --> 01:10:11,238
All right, never mind.

923
01:10:11,323 --> 01:10:14,121
These Huns have been the aggressors
in every war in Europe...

924
01:10:14,203 --> 01:10:15,636
since the time of Julius Caesar.

925
01:10:15,723 --> 01:10:19,238
I couldn't attempt to describe to you
the horrors committed by the Germans.

926
01:10:19,323 --> 01:10:20,358
Look.

927
01:10:20,443 --> 01:10:21,796
Would we have time?

928
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:23,994
...after the Germans had been through...

929
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:26,438
- the women of the town<i>...</i>
- That German's here again.

930
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:29,481
It is not true. It is lies, all lies.

931
01:10:29,883 --> 01:10:33,193
Come on, Cal. Is it scary?

932
01:10:35,483 --> 01:10:36,757
Here we go.

933
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:48,638
It is lies, all lies.

934
01:10:48,723 --> 01:10:51,157
I'd like to give that guy
a piece of my mind.

935
01:10:51,523 --> 01:10:53,275
See over there. That's Castroville.

936
01:10:53,363 --> 01:10:55,035
Everything looks so small down there.

937
01:10:55,123 --> 01:10:56,841
<i>Higher and higher and higher and higher</i>

938
01:10:56,923 --> 01:10:57,958
What?

939
01:10:58,043 --> 01:11:00,273
<i>Growing and growing</i>
<i>and growing and growing</i>

940
01:11:00,363 --> 01:11:04,072
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you sometime.

941
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,361
Does Aron really love me?

942
01:11:12,403 --> 01:11:14,314
I seem to have sort of lost him.

943
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:18,032
I mean, we're going
to be married someday, but<i>...</i>

944
01:11:18,123 --> 01:11:20,557
Well, if he does love me, he doesn't<i>...</i>

945
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,956
I can't tell anymore.

946
01:11:25,643 --> 01:11:27,520
Cal, can I ask you something?

947
01:11:28,403 --> 01:11:29,631
Yeah, go ahead.

948
01:11:31,363 --> 01:11:33,718
These girls that you always
go around with.

949
01:11:33,803 --> 01:11:37,034
You know, remember there was
that little Mexican girl once.

950
01:11:37,123 --> 01:11:39,000
What are girls like that like?

951
01:11:42,723 --> 01:11:44,793
You don't really love them, do you?

952
01:11:46,643 --> 01:11:49,635
Why do you go out with them?
Is it because you're bad?

953
01:11:51,043 --> 01:11:52,681
You're not angry, are you?

954
01:11:55,563 --> 01:11:58,919
- Well, why do you, then? Are you bad?
- Do you think I'm bad?

955
01:12:01,203 --> 01:12:02,522
I don't know.

956
01:12:03,723 --> 01:12:06,999
I guess I don't know
what is good and what's bad.

957
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:09,278
I mean, Aron is so good...

958
01:12:09,843 --> 01:12:11,356
and I'm not.

959
01:12:11,443 --> 01:12:13,434
Not good enough for Aron, anyway.

960
01:12:13,523 --> 01:12:15,798
Because sometimes when I'm with Aron<i>...</i>

961
01:12:16,363 --> 01:12:18,672
Aron likes to talk about our being in love...

962
01:12:18,763 --> 01:12:21,323
and think about it
and that's all right, but<i>...</i>

963
01:12:22,443 --> 01:12:25,435
These girls that you go out with, do you...

964
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:29,157
Maybe I don't know what love is, exactly.

965
01:12:29,883 --> 01:12:33,239
I know love is good the way Aron says...

966
01:12:35,243 --> 01:12:37,518
but it's more than that, it's got to be.

967
01:12:39,603 --> 01:12:41,673
I shouldn't talk to you this way...

968
01:12:41,763 --> 01:12:43,913
but I don't know who else to talk to.

969
01:12:44,483 --> 01:12:46,758
Sometimes I think I'm really bad.

970
01:12:47,923 --> 01:12:50,118
Sometimes I don't know what to think.

971
01:12:52,763 --> 01:12:55,357
- Aron'll knock that out of you.
- Will he?

972
01:12:56,563 --> 01:12:57,678
He's got to.

973
01:12:58,563 --> 01:13:00,519
The way I figure it out...

974
01:13:01,363 --> 01:13:03,399
Aron never having had a mother...

975
01:13:04,603 --> 01:13:07,436
he's made her everything good
that he can think of...

976
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,801
and that's what he thinks I am.

977
01:13:09,883 --> 01:13:12,602
That's who he's in love with.
It's not me at all.

978
01:13:14,243 --> 01:13:17,155
'Cause I'm not a bit like that made<i>- u</i>p one.
Not a bit.

979
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:20,276
I don't mean I think I'm really bad.

980
01:13:23,243 --> 01:13:24,676
Look at that star.

981
01:13:26,163 --> 01:13:28,313
It must be a planet, it's so bright.

982
01:13:29,283 --> 01:13:30,238
Probably.

983
01:13:35,323 --> 01:13:38,281
I bet that girl's waiting for you
down there somewhere.

984
01:13:39,923 --> 01:13:41,641
She can just wait.

985
01:13:42,123 --> 01:13:43,556
She was pretty.

986
01:13:47,483 --> 01:13:50,156
You've been awfully nice, Cal,
taking care of me.

987
01:14:10,123 --> 01:14:12,432
I love Aron. I do, really I do.

988
01:14:16,563 --> 01:14:18,042
I do.

989
01:14:23,723 --> 01:14:24,872
To give these fiends a lesson that<i>...</i>

990
01:14:24,963 --> 01:14:26,396
Have you seen Abra, Mr. Albrecht?

991
01:14:26,483 --> 01:14:27,552
Lies. All lies.

992
01:14:27,643 --> 01:14:29,440
What's the matter with you tonight, Gus?

993
01:14:29,523 --> 01:14:31,081
Gus, come on.

994
01:14:31,683 --> 01:14:33,036
There's Aron.

995
01:14:34,323 --> 01:14:35,915
You're a good shoemaker.

996
01:14:37,923 --> 01:14:39,595
There's Aron, down there.

997
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:41,594
Major, why don't you stay out of politics?

998
01:14:41,683 --> 01:14:42,832
Mr. Albrecht.

999
01:14:43,683 --> 01:14:46,834
They're pushing him around.
What are they doing?

1000
01:14:48,163 --> 01:14:49,835
That'd kill Dad if he knew that.

1001
01:14:49,923 --> 01:14:52,517
Hey, operator,
when does this thing move again.

1002
01:14:52,603 --> 01:14:53,513
Hey!

1003
01:15:01,723 --> 01:15:03,554
Cal, don't!

1004
01:15:03,643 --> 01:15:05,395
Watch yourself, get back!

1005
01:15:06,763 --> 01:15:08,799
Please. Somebody pull him back.

1006
01:15:09,843 --> 01:15:11,242
Don't bother me!

1007
01:15:11,323 --> 01:15:12,961
Come on.

1008
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:23,200
- Gus, come on, have a drink.
- No, Charlie, no drink.

1009
01:15:29,403 --> 01:15:31,041
What are you waiting for?

1010
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:36,038
Mr. Albrecht, calm down.
They're not bad fellows.

1011
01:15:36,123 --> 01:15:38,114
Aron, you are a child.

1012
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:45,358
All I tried to do was buy him a drink.

1013
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:48,118
Gustav.

1014
01:15:48,203 --> 01:15:49,238
Silence.

1015
01:15:49,323 --> 01:15:51,996
You all loved him a few weeks ago,
what's gotten into you?

1016
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:53,994
I'm sick of him sticking up
for the Germans.

1017
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,756
- You a friend of the Germans?
- I'm a friend of this German.

1018
01:15:56,843 --> 01:16:00,472
There are rose plants in that border there.
Please be careful where you step.

1019
01:16:00,563 --> 01:16:03,714
We liked him. He made us laugh
because of his funny German accent.

1020
01:16:03,803 --> 01:16:06,237
Let him read this
in his funny German accent.

1021
01:16:06,683 --> 01:16:09,243
- What is it?
- Let him come down and read it.

1022
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:12,076
- He doesn't have to read anything.
- I will read it.

1023
01:16:12,523 --> 01:16:13,922
Here, give it to me.

1024
01:16:19,043 --> 01:16:21,716
"The Government, with deep regret,
informs...

1025
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:31,471
"that your son was killed in action,
15th of April.

1026
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:34,834
"He died a hero and an American."

1027
01:16:39,603 --> 01:16:41,833
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopps. I did not<i>...</i>

1028
01:16:41,923 --> 01:16:43,436
You're not sorry enough.

1029
01:16:43,523 --> 01:16:46,720
- I don't think he's sorry.
- He's not sorry at all.

1030
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:49,795
- Listen, why don't we all go on home...
- You're not sorry enough.

1031
01:16:49,883 --> 01:16:51,874
Why aren't you in the war?

1032
01:16:51,963 --> 01:16:53,601
This will make you sorry.

1033
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:23,877
Hello, Charlie.

1034
01:17:24,603 --> 01:17:27,071
Danny, what are you fellows
doing here, anyway?

1035
01:17:27,163 --> 01:17:28,118
Get up.

1036
01:17:28,683 --> 01:17:31,243
Loretta, I didn't expect to find you here.

1037
01:17:31,723 --> 01:17:33,042
Evening, Rose.

1038
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:37,559
Looks like they messed up
your rose garden a little here, Gus.

1039
01:17:37,963 --> 01:17:39,760
Somebody owes you an apology.

1040
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:50,155
How about you folks all going home now?

1041
01:17:50,403 --> 01:17:52,200
I think this'll do for tonight.

1042
01:17:57,403 --> 01:17:59,280
Good evening, Mrs. Albrecht.

1043
01:17:59,963 --> 01:18:01,282
- May I?
- Come in.

1044
01:18:06,203 --> 01:18:09,001
This place will be fixed up
just like it was before.

1045
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,075
- I'm gonna see to it.
<i>- Ja.</i> He will see to it.

1046
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:21,357
Where were you?

1047
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:25,835
Where did you get his coat?

1048
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:38,197
You all right?

1049
01:18:39,763 --> 01:18:43,312
You had to start slugging, didn't you?
Were you showing off for her?

1050
01:18:43,723 --> 01:18:45,395
You had to start slugging.

1051
01:18:45,963 --> 01:18:48,875
- I was trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

1052
01:18:49,883 --> 01:18:53,159
If you want to slug people,
do it for yourself and not for me.

1053
01:18:53,243 --> 01:18:57,202
- And don't lie to me about trying to...
- Aron, I tried to help you!

1054
01:19:01,923 --> 01:19:05,359
- Great big Aron.
- You finished?

1055
01:19:06,683 --> 01:19:10,676
- No!
- Cal, stop it! Don't.

1056
01:19:10,763 --> 01:19:11,957
- Don't.
- Don't do that.

1057
01:19:12,043 --> 01:19:14,432
- Don't.
- Abra, don't do that!

1058
01:19:23,523 --> 01:19:24,592
Wait here.

1059
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:04,115
I was trying to help him.

1060
01:20:07,123 --> 01:20:09,114
Who am I kidding?

1061
01:20:09,723 --> 01:20:11,441
I tried to kill him.

1062
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:15,356
Mike, give me a drink.

1063
01:20:18,163 --> 01:20:19,755
- Don't drink any more.
- Why?

1064
01:20:19,843 --> 01:20:22,755
- No, please. It's not good for you.
- It's good for me.

1065
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:27,156
- No, you're gonna get drunk.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get drunk.

1066
01:20:28,803 --> 01:20:31,920
Please forget it, what happened up
on the ferris wheel.

1067
01:20:32,243 --> 01:20:34,473
It didn't mean anything, really.

1068
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:37,032
Please, forget it. It didn't mean anything.

1069
01:20:38,283 --> 01:20:40,399
Say it didn't. Please, say it didn't.

1070
01:20:43,163 --> 01:20:47,520
Someday he's gonna know
who his real son is.

1071
01:20:48,563 --> 01:20:49,518
What?

1072
01:20:51,283 --> 01:20:52,955
Someday he's gonna know.

1073
01:20:56,243 --> 01:20:58,393
I don't understand you. You scare me.

1074
01:21:01,683 --> 01:21:04,516
- I know. I scare myself.
- Abra.

1075
01:21:23,683 --> 01:21:25,355
Fix me another drink.

1076
01:21:31,403 --> 01:21:35,476
- I want that money. Now you give it to me.
- You know I haven't any money here.

1077
01:21:39,283 --> 01:21:40,238
Okay.

1078
01:21:41,003 --> 01:21:43,722
- When will you get it?
- In the morning, I suppose.

1079
01:21:44,883 --> 01:21:47,317
Okay. I'll sleep here.

1080
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:51,803
Come on. You've gotta go home.

1081
01:21:51,883 --> 01:21:53,999
If you still feel the same way
in the morning...

1082
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,801
you come back, we'll go to the bank...

1083
01:21:55,883 --> 01:21:58,522
and I'll see that you get everything
that's coming to you.

1084
01:21:58,603 --> 01:22:01,959
I'll buy out your share.
I'll go on and make a fortune with it.

1085
01:22:02,923 --> 01:22:07,201
Okay. That seems fair to me, Will.

1086
01:22:32,683 --> 01:22:33,638
Abra.

1087
01:22:37,043 --> 01:22:38,317
What?

1088
01:22:39,723 --> 01:22:40,997
- Who is it?
- Cal.

1089
01:22:43,243 --> 01:22:44,312
- Cal?
- Yeah.

1090
01:22:45,843 --> 01:22:48,755
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I want to see you.

1091
01:22:49,723 --> 01:22:51,839
Wait till I put something on.

1092
01:23:09,483 --> 01:23:12,441
I gotta tell you something.
Can you keep a secret?

1093
01:23:12,963 --> 01:23:15,033
Yes. What is it?

1094
01:23:16,323 --> 01:23:18,883
What's the matter? You look terrible.

1095
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:24,233
- I got it.
- What?

1096
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:30,393
Remember that money? Dad lost?

1097
01:23:30,483 --> 01:23:32,155
On that lettuce business?

1098
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:38,358
- I got it.
- You mean you earned it all back?

1099
01:23:38,443 --> 01:23:41,116
- I've earned every cent.
- That's wonderful, Cal.

1100
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:48,439
You got any time off tomorrow
from the hospital?

1101
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:52,233
I get an hour at lunchtime. Why?

1102
01:23:53,043 --> 01:23:54,681
Thursday's Dad's birthday.

1103
01:23:57,683 --> 01:23:59,753
And I'm gonna give a party for him.

1104
01:24:02,683 --> 01:24:07,393
And I want you and me,
you and Aron and me...

1105
01:24:08,403 --> 01:24:09,836
to be there.

1106
01:24:12,003 --> 01:24:15,439
I'm gonna give him that money
just like it was a birthday present.

1107
01:24:15,963 --> 01:24:18,602
You could come
and help me get some junk...

1108
01:24:18,683 --> 01:24:21,402
- and we could decorate the house.
- Sure.

1109
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:24,992
And we'll get balloons...

1110
01:24:27,603 --> 01:24:31,596
- and all that kid stuff, birthday stuff.
- We can go to the five and 10.

1111
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:36,358
- Will you do it?
- I'd like to.

1112
01:24:52,483 --> 01:24:55,077
I'm sort of<i>...</i>

1113
01:25:02,403 --> 01:25:03,802
Why did I hit Aron?

1114
01:25:06,363 --> 01:25:08,558
Why did I hit him so hard?

1115
01:25:19,483 --> 01:25:21,997
Will you help me?

1116
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:24,313
Will you really help me?

1117
01:25:26,483 --> 01:25:27,916
I'll help you, Cal.

1118
01:25:32,723 --> 01:25:33,792
Be careful.

1119
01:25:38,163 --> 01:25:39,596
How'd I get up here?

1120
01:25:50,763 --> 01:25:53,596
- Is your father coming?
- Yeah.

1121
01:25:53,683 --> 01:25:56,595
- Cal, don't get nervous.
- I think it looks beautiful.

1122
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:58,835
Don't you? I love the way it looks.

1123
01:25:58,923 --> 01:26:01,073
- It looks festive, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

1124
01:26:01,163 --> 01:26:02,755
Yes, Cal, it looks very pretty.

1125
01:26:02,843 --> 01:26:05,152
- Do you think this is childish?
- Not a bit.

1126
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:08,155
The room looks lovely.
Your father's going to love it.

1127
01:26:09,163 --> 01:26:11,313
- How's the turkey?
- It's a good turkey.

1128
01:26:11,403 --> 01:26:13,473
- Smells ready.
- It'll be ready.

1129
01:26:13,563 --> 01:26:16,760
- Aron didn't get him anything?
- He told me he had something.

1130
01:26:25,123 --> 01:26:27,762
- What?
- He didn't tell me what it was.

1131
01:26:35,403 --> 01:26:37,963
- It won't stack up against mine, will it?
- No.

1132
01:26:38,523 --> 01:26:40,161
- Do you wanna see mine?
- I'd like to.

1133
01:26:40,243 --> 01:26:41,801
- I got it wrapped up.
- Show it to me.

1134
01:26:41,883 --> 01:26:42,872
- Wanna see it?
- Yes.

1135
01:26:42,963 --> 01:26:43,998
Okay.

1136
01:26:46,123 --> 01:26:47,476
- You like it?
- It's pretty.

1137
01:26:47,563 --> 01:26:49,076
You think it's pretty?

1138
01:26:50,723 --> 01:26:52,395
Don't drink any more wine.

1139
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:58,721
- Did Aron tell you what the present was?
- No.

1140
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:02,676
- You sure?
- Honestly, he didn't.

1141
01:27:03,363 --> 01:27:05,752
I'd tell you if he did. Honestly, I would.

1142
01:27:06,883 --> 01:27:10,193
Now everything's gonna go off fine. Here.

1143
01:27:11,843 --> 01:27:13,196
The brooms.

1144
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:16,071
- Don't you do anything to give me away.
- I wouldn't.

1145
01:27:16,163 --> 01:27:18,757
We'll let him come in
and let the house speak for itself.

1146
01:27:18,843 --> 01:27:22,722
- We'll act like it was any other old day.
- Yes. Wait, Cal.

1147
01:27:25,163 --> 01:27:26,357
Cal.

1148
01:27:30,923 --> 01:27:32,595
You look wonderful.

1149
01:27:34,203 --> 01:27:35,158
Thanks.

1150
01:27:45,003 --> 01:27:46,482
But I need my son.

1151
01:27:46,563 --> 01:27:49,600
It isn't that he doesn't want
to fight for his country. He does.

1152
01:27:49,683 --> 01:27:50,957
I need him to work the farm.

1153
01:27:51,043 --> 01:27:53,352
Things can't be as bad as you say,
Mr. Piscora.

1154
01:27:53,443 --> 01:27:55,832
You must be making plenty of money
out of your crops.

1155
01:27:55,923 --> 01:27:59,279
No money. I sold this year's crop
for 5 cents before I even planted it.

1156
01:27:59,363 --> 01:28:00,557
Everything cost so much now.

1157
01:28:00,643 --> 01:28:03,203
And now I got to sell next year crop.
So I need my boy.

1158
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:05,194
I can do nothing about it, Mr. Piscora.

1159
01:28:05,283 --> 01:28:07,638
In all conscience,
I cannot excuse your son.

1160
01:28:07,723 --> 01:28:10,635
- Come on, Poppa.
- I don't like it.

1161
01:28:11,283 --> 01:28:13,956
I'm telling you. I don't like it.

1162
01:28:18,283 --> 01:28:20,239
Hello, Abra. Nice to see you.

1163
01:28:20,323 --> 01:28:23,440
- Gonna stay to dinner?
- Yes, I am. Is something the matter?

1164
01:28:23,523 --> 01:28:27,277
No, nothing. I guess I shouldn't
have taken that job in the Draft Board.

1165
01:28:27,963 --> 01:28:30,761
- Did you notice the snow on Mount Toro?
- Yes, I saw it.

1166
01:28:30,843 --> 01:28:33,073
Say, that means we got
a good year coming in.

1167
01:28:33,163 --> 01:28:36,519
- We could use it.
- Let's go in.

1168
01:28:56,403 --> 01:28:58,758
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Happy birthday, Mr. Trask.

1169
01:28:58,843 --> 01:29:01,277
Is it possible? I'm very touched.

1170
01:29:01,363 --> 01:29:04,560
- Are you surprised?
- I had no idea. I'd forgotten completely.

1171
01:29:04,643 --> 01:29:08,272
- We knew you had, didn't we?
- Completely. I don't know what to say.

1172
01:29:12,043 --> 01:29:13,601
We got turkey.

1173
01:29:13,683 --> 01:29:17,119
- And champagne.
- Champagne, and we got all the things.

1174
01:29:19,883 --> 01:29:22,443
- We got the trimmings here.
- Isn't that pretty?

1175
01:29:27,283 --> 01:29:30,320
Got something for you.

1176
01:29:30,403 --> 01:29:33,281
Presents, too. Isn't that nice. Look.

1177
01:29:38,043 --> 01:29:40,318
- Ain't you gonna open it up?
- Yes.

1178
01:29:40,403 --> 01:29:44,601
Dad, Abra and I have one for you, too,
only we can't exactly give it to you.

1179
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:49,632
I didn't tell Abra I was going to do this,
but we're engaged.

1180
01:29:52,883 --> 01:29:55,761
I couldn't have wished for anything nicer.

1181
01:29:57,203 --> 01:30:00,036
A lovely birthday present.

1182
01:30:01,163 --> 01:30:03,438
- You have my blessings.
- Thank you, Dad.

1183
01:30:04,723 --> 01:30:07,317
- But you haven't opened Cal's present yet.
- No.

1184
01:30:09,483 --> 01:30:12,395
But I can't imagine having
anything better than this.

1185
01:30:13,523 --> 01:30:14,558
Excuse me.

1186
01:30:16,003 --> 01:30:20,076
'Course I suspected it right along.
But, Cal, coming on my birthday.

1187
01:30:24,203 --> 01:30:25,318
What's this?

1188
01:30:27,323 --> 01:30:28,722
What is this?

1189
01:30:31,763 --> 01:30:35,915
I made it. And it's for you.
It's all the money you lost on the lettuce.

1190
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:38,198
You made it? But how?

1191
01:30:40,403 --> 01:30:41,392
Go on.

1192
01:30:42,883 --> 01:30:44,157
- Beans.
- Beans?

1193
01:30:45,763 --> 01:30:48,880
Yes, we bought futures at 5 cents...

1194
01:30:49,523 --> 01:30:54,153
and the war came along
and the price went sky-high.

1195
01:30:55,443 --> 01:30:58,640
So, that's for you.

1196
01:30:59,843 --> 01:31:02,641
It's all the money you lost
in the lettuce business.

1197
01:31:03,883 --> 01:31:05,111
It's for you.

1198
01:31:07,043 --> 01:31:09,796
- I made it for you.
- You will have to give it back.

1199
01:31:12,203 --> 01:31:16,879
No, I made it for you, Dad.
I want you to have it.

1200
01:31:17,563 --> 01:31:20,714
- You will have to give it back.
- Who? I can't give it...

1201
01:31:20,803 --> 01:31:24,352
- To the people you got it from.
- No, the British Purchasing Agency?

1202
01:31:24,443 --> 01:31:27,116
- I can't give it back.
- Give it to the farmers you robbed.

1203
01:31:27,203 --> 01:31:28,716
We didn't rob anybody, Dad.

1204
01:31:28,803 --> 01:31:32,478
We paid 2 cents a pound,
2 cents over market for that stuff.

1205
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:36,719
I sign my name
and boys go out and some die...

1206
01:31:37,243 --> 01:31:39,393
and some live helpless
without arms and legs.

1207
01:31:39,483 --> 01:31:41,314
Not one will come back untorn.

1208
01:31:41,923 --> 01:31:44,676
Do you think I could take
a profit from that?

1209
01:31:47,243 --> 01:31:49,837
I don't want the money, Cal!
I couldn't take it!

1210
01:31:50,403 --> 01:31:53,122
- I thank you for the thought, but...
- I'll keep it for you.

1211
01:31:53,203 --> 01:31:55,956
I'll wrap it up
and we'll just keep it in here...

1212
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:57,396
I'll never take it!

1213
01:31:57,483 --> 01:32:00,680
Son, I'd be happy if you'd give me...

1214
01:32:00,763 --> 01:32:03,721
something like your brother's given me.

1215
01:32:03,803 --> 01:32:07,591
Something honest and human and good.
Don't be angry, Son.

1216
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:11,281
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

1217
01:32:11,403 --> 01:32:13,314
That's something I could value.

1218
01:32:41,003 --> 01:32:42,356
I hate you!

1219
01:32:59,683 --> 01:33:01,355
What are you doing?

1220
01:33:07,483 --> 01:33:09,633
He doesn't want anything from me.

1221
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:11,271
Cal, don't.

1222
01:33:13,883 --> 01:33:15,032
Please, don't.

1223
01:33:23,843 --> 01:33:24,798
Abra!

1224
01:33:45,643 --> 01:33:47,554
Don't you ever touch her again.

1225
01:33:50,203 --> 01:33:51,522
I don't trust you.

1226
01:33:54,283 --> 01:33:55,511
You're no good.

1227
01:33:56,443 --> 01:34:00,356
You're mean and vicious and wild.
And you always have been.

1228
01:34:00,723 --> 01:34:02,475
You know it, too, don't you?

1229
01:34:02,843 --> 01:34:05,232
Father and I have put up
with every vicious thing...

1230
01:34:05,323 --> 01:34:09,316
you could think of since you were a child.
And we've always forgiven you.

1231
01:34:09,883 --> 01:34:12,158
But now I don't want you to go near Abra.

1232
01:34:12,243 --> 01:34:15,360
I don't want you to talk with her.
Just stay away from her!

1233
01:34:42,003 --> 01:34:44,722
- You want to go some place with me?
- Why should I?

1234
01:34:47,923 --> 01:34:49,675
I got something to show you.

1235
01:34:51,163 --> 01:34:54,792
- Think you'll find it very interesting.
- What are you talking about?

1236
01:34:55,883 --> 01:34:59,080
Maybe our mother didn't die
and go to heaven after all, Aron.

1237
01:34:59,763 --> 01:35:02,596
- What do you mean by that?
- Maybe she didn't.

1238
01:35:02,683 --> 01:35:04,480
Maybe she's alive someplace.

1239
01:35:06,523 --> 01:35:08,115
What are you up to now?

1240
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:11,639
Remember when we were kids,
we used to make up stories about her?

1241
01:35:12,243 --> 01:35:16,759
You said she must have looked
like heaven's youngest angel, remember?

1242
01:35:17,963 --> 01:35:20,158
Remember that time I shot that rabbit?

1243
01:35:20,843 --> 01:35:22,720
You cried and you said...

1244
01:35:22,843 --> 01:35:25,835
that she would have cried, too,
'cause she was so tenderhearted.

1245
01:35:25,923 --> 01:35:28,642
And you said I was bad,
you remember that?

1246
01:35:29,603 --> 01:35:32,959
I just want to show you something.
It's not gonna take very long.

1247
01:35:33,043 --> 01:35:34,317
What's the matter, you afraid?

1248
01:35:34,403 --> 01:35:36,758
I'm not afraid to look at anything
you could show me.

1249
01:35:36,843 --> 01:35:40,802
Can you look at the truth, just once?

1250
01:35:43,123 --> 01:35:47,435
Come on, you can look
at the truth just once. Can't you?

1251
01:35:48,923 --> 01:35:49,878
Come on.

1252
01:35:51,563 --> 01:35:54,475
I want to show you something.
It won't take very long.

1253
01:36:28,203 --> 01:36:29,352
Oh, Cal.

1254
01:36:31,483 --> 01:36:32,438
Hello.

1255
01:36:55,923 --> 01:37:00,280
Mother, this is your other son, Aron.

1256
01:37:02,363 --> 01:37:04,593
Aron is everything that's good, Mother.

1257
01:37:13,163 --> 01:37:14,994
Say hello to your mother.

1258
01:37:29,123 --> 01:37:31,034
Say hello to your mother, Aron!

1259
01:37:32,123 --> 01:37:34,398
Joe!

1260
01:37:45,923 --> 01:37:47,834
- Play another song!
- Quiet!

1261
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:51,312
Five!

1262
01:37:51,803 --> 01:37:55,478
"I'm thinking of the lilac trees
that shook their purple plumes

1263
01:37:56,563 --> 01:37:59,680
"I'm thinking of the rivulet
with its cool and silvery flow

1264
01:38:00,243 --> 01:38:04,077
"Of the old gray rock that shadowed it
and the peppermint below"

1265
01:38:09,683 --> 01:38:12,959
- Where is Aron?
- I don't know. I'm not my brother's keeper.

1266
01:38:13,043 --> 01:38:14,635
- Where did you go?
- For a ride.

1267
01:38:14,723 --> 01:38:16,839
- What did you quarrel about?
- You.

1268
01:38:17,163 --> 01:38:19,882
- You're angry about the money.
- No, I'm not angry.

1269
01:38:20,203 --> 01:38:22,034
I like it. I think it's great.

1270
01:38:22,763 --> 01:38:24,799
I'm gonna go away
and take that money with me.

1271
01:38:24,883 --> 01:38:28,273
I think I'll start me a little business.
Just like my mother did.

1272
01:38:28,363 --> 01:38:32,322
- What do you know about your mother?
- I know where she is and what she is.

1273
01:38:32,403 --> 01:38:35,122
And I know why she left you.
Couldn't stand it.

1274
01:38:35,643 --> 01:38:38,362
You didn't really love her
any more than you do me.

1275
01:38:39,043 --> 01:38:41,477
Because of your goodness, your rightness.

1276
01:38:41,563 --> 01:38:44,202
You never gave either one of us
an inch, ever...

1277
01:38:44,283 --> 01:38:46,035
from what you thought was right.

1278
01:38:46,123 --> 01:38:49,877
You kept on forgiving us,
but you never really loved us.

1279
01:38:50,683 --> 01:38:52,674
I know why you didn't love me.

1280
01:38:52,763 --> 01:38:54,162
Because I'm like my mother...

1281
01:38:54,243 --> 01:38:57,076
and you never forgave yourself
for having loved her.

1282
01:38:59,163 --> 01:39:02,997
I'm not gonna forgive him.
I'm never gonna forgive him.

1283
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:07,474
- Where is Aron?
- He's with her, with his mother.

1284
01:39:08,323 --> 01:39:10,712
She's over there in Monterey,
if you want to know.

1285
01:39:10,803 --> 01:39:12,555
She owns one of them houses.

1286
01:39:13,963 --> 01:39:16,557
I took Aron there tonight
because I was jealous.

1287
01:39:17,483 --> 01:39:21,601
I've been jealous all my life.
Jealous, I couldn't even stand it.

1288
01:39:25,923 --> 01:39:28,198
Tonight, I even tried to buy your love.

1289
01:39:30,243 --> 01:39:32,199
But now I don't want it anymore.

1290
01:39:34,763 --> 01:39:38,358
- I can't use it anymore.
- Don't talk to your father like that.

1291
01:39:42,003 --> 01:39:44,198
I don't want any kind of love anymore.

1292
01:39:46,043 --> 01:39:47,476
It doesn't pay off.

1293
01:39:48,003 --> 01:39:49,755
No future in it.

1294
01:39:52,163 --> 01:39:53,835
Let him go if he wants to.

1295
01:39:58,683 --> 01:40:00,435
No, I won't.

1296
01:40:12,763 --> 01:40:14,515
You hate me, too, don't you?

1297
01:40:15,963 --> 01:40:17,316
I'm afraid of you.

1298
01:40:22,203 --> 01:40:25,673
What you did to Aron tonight,
I don't know what it will do to him.

1299
01:40:28,163 --> 01:40:30,631
I feel like I'm to blame, too.

1300
01:40:32,123 --> 01:40:36,878
- Adam!
- Here. What is it?

1301
01:40:36,963 --> 01:40:39,841
...drunk and had a couple of fights.
He's gone kind of crazy.

1302
01:40:39,923 --> 01:40:42,721
He's at the station now.
Wait, I'll drive you down in my car.

1303
01:40:42,803 --> 01:40:43,838
Cal!

1304
01:40:50,323 --> 01:40:52,917
- What happened between you and Aron?
- Why?

1305
01:40:53,003 --> 01:40:56,040
He's gone kind of crazy.
He's drunk and had a couple of fights...

1306
01:40:56,123 --> 01:40:58,239
and seemed determined
to get himself hurt.

1307
01:40:58,323 --> 01:41:00,234
He's leaving on that troop train tonight...

1308
01:41:00,323 --> 01:41:02,712
and says he's gonna enlist tomorrow
at King City.

1309
01:41:02,803 --> 01:41:06,239
Adam's on his way down there now
to talk to him before the train leaves.

1310
01:41:06,323 --> 01:41:08,632
I think you better get down there.

1311
01:41:09,723 --> 01:41:11,520
- Yeah.
- My car's downstairs.

1312
01:42:08,243 --> 01:42:10,438
Do you know what a stroke is, exactly?

1313
01:42:14,603 --> 01:42:17,640
This one is a leakage of blood in the brain
caused by shock.

1314
01:42:17,723 --> 01:42:19,793
There have been earlier, smaller leakages.

1315
01:42:19,883 --> 01:42:22,761
The left side is paralyzed,
and the right side partly.

1316
01:42:23,363 --> 01:42:25,957
In other words,
your father is nearly helpless.

1317
01:42:27,123 --> 01:42:30,160
- Will he die?
- He might live a week or a year.

1318
01:42:30,923 --> 01:42:32,436
He might die tonight.

1319
01:42:39,123 --> 01:42:42,354
- Will he know me?
- You'll have to find that out for yourself.

1320
01:42:46,843 --> 01:42:48,242
Good day.

1321
01:42:50,243 --> 01:42:53,553
Good day, Doctor. Good day, Sam.

1322
01:42:55,483 --> 01:42:58,281
"Cain rose up against his brother Abel,
and slew him.

1323
01:42:58,803 --> 01:43:02,762
"And Cain went away and dwelt
in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."

1324
01:43:04,763 --> 01:43:07,277
Now why don't you go away some place?

1325
01:43:21,083 --> 01:43:23,961
- He's right.
- No.

1326
01:43:25,843 --> 01:43:28,277
Yes, he is. He's right. That's what I'll do.

1327
01:43:37,923 --> 01:43:40,073
Who's gonna wash these things for me?

1328
01:43:41,883 --> 01:43:42,952
Thank you.

1329
01:43:45,203 --> 01:43:47,080
- There you are.
- How is he?

1330
01:43:47,163 --> 01:43:49,996
He's fine. He's my darling.

1331
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:51,880
Washed his face, combed his hair.

1332
01:43:51,963 --> 01:43:53,476
Can I go in there now?

1333
01:43:53,923 --> 01:43:57,279
Just for a minute. I want him to rest.
Gotta get lots of sleep.

1334
01:43:59,163 --> 01:44:02,792
- How is he, really?
- Haven't I seen you at the hospital?

1335
01:44:03,523 --> 01:44:05,593
- Not part of the family, are you?
- No.

1336
01:44:05,683 --> 01:44:07,002
I didn't think so.

1337
01:44:07,083 --> 01:44:10,200
I can tell you,
I won't have this job for long.

1338
01:44:10,283 --> 01:44:14,322
That's my luck. Always seem to get them
when they're old and ready to die off.

1339
01:44:28,443 --> 01:44:32,322
Now doesn't he look nice?
He's going to be a darling patient.

1340
01:44:32,963 --> 01:44:35,557
Even tried to smile at me,
didn't you, my dear?

1341
01:44:36,363 --> 01:44:38,558
- I don't want you to tire my patient.
- Please go.

1342
01:44:38,643 --> 01:44:41,601
Now listen, miss,
don't you try to order me about.

1343
01:44:42,283 --> 01:44:44,114
I'll report you to the doctor.

1344
01:44:44,443 --> 01:44:46,957
Will you go out of the room
and shut the door?

1345
01:45:21,003 --> 01:45:21,958
Father.

1346
01:45:25,243 --> 01:45:26,517
Can you hear me?

1347
01:45:32,043 --> 01:45:33,681
I did an awful thing.

1348
01:45:37,683 --> 01:45:38,718
I'm sorry.

1349
01:46:12,003 --> 01:46:13,994
Mr. Trask, can you hear me?

1350
01:46:15,043 --> 01:46:17,682
Is it just Cal you won't answer?

1351
01:46:18,243 --> 01:46:19,596
Can you answer?

1352
01:46:21,763 --> 01:46:23,958
I think you can understand me, though.

1353
01:46:24,803 --> 01:46:28,352
I think behind your eyes
you're just as alert as ever.

1354
01:46:29,443 --> 01:46:32,401
You understand everything I say
only you can't show it.

1355
01:46:39,723 --> 01:46:43,398
Excuse me, Mr. Trask,
for daring to speak to you this way...

1356
01:46:43,803 --> 01:46:47,876
but it's awful not to be loved.
It's the worst thing in the world.

1357
01:46:50,003 --> 01:46:52,437
Don't ask me how I know that.
I just know it.

1358
01:46:52,763 --> 01:46:56,312
It makes you mean and violent and cruel.

1359
01:46:56,403 --> 01:46:59,156
And that's the way
Cal has always felt, all his life.

1360
01:47:00,443 --> 01:47:03,435
I know you didn't mean it to be that way,
but it's true.

1361
01:47:05,163 --> 01:47:09,714
You never gave him your love.
You never asked him for his.

1362
01:47:10,923 --> 01:47:12,959
You never asked him for one thing.

1363
01:47:14,043 --> 01:47:17,638
Cal is going away, Mr. Trask.
But before he goes<i>...</i>

1364
01:47:19,843 --> 01:47:23,677
He did something very bad,
and I'm not asking you to forgive him.

1365
01:47:24,123 --> 01:47:26,876
You have to give him some sign
that you love him...

1366
01:47:27,203 --> 01:47:29,034
or else he'll never be a man.

1367
01:47:29,723 --> 01:47:33,796
He'll just keep on feeling guilty
and alone, unless you release him.

1368
01:47:35,363 --> 01:47:36,682
Please, help him.

1369
01:47:37,203 --> 01:47:40,752
I love Cal, Mr. Trask,
and I want him to be whole and strong...

1370
01:47:40,843 --> 01:47:43,357
and you're the only one who can do it.

1371
01:47:43,443 --> 01:47:45,240
So try, please try.

1372
01:47:47,123 --> 01:47:50,195
If you could ask him for something.

1373
01:47:50,963 --> 01:47:53,761
Let him help you so that he knows
that you love him.

1374
01:47:54,643 --> 01:47:56,235
Let him do for you.

1375
01:47:59,563 --> 01:48:04,273
Excuse me, Mr. Trask, for daring
to speak to you this way, but I just had to.

1376
01:48:09,803 --> 01:48:10,872
You've tired my patient...

1377
01:48:10,963 --> 01:48:14,399
and I most certainly shall report it
to the doctor in the morning.

1378
01:48:16,603 --> 01:48:20,357
You don't know that he accuses you.
You don't know what he's thinking about.

1379
01:48:20,643 --> 01:48:23,282
Stop it, Cal.
You gonna cry for the rest of your life?

1380
01:48:23,363 --> 01:48:24,842
- No.
- Then stop it.

1381
01:48:25,603 --> 01:48:28,595
Go in there and talk to him
before it's too late.

1382
01:48:28,683 --> 01:48:31,436
- I can't.
- Please try.

1383
01:48:32,123 --> 01:48:33,397
Get it straight.

1384
01:48:34,403 --> 01:48:38,362
Get through to him, somehow.
Please try, Cal, before it's too late.

1385
01:48:44,763 --> 01:48:48,517
- Is there any coffee around here?
- I'll get you some in a minute.

1386
01:48:54,083 --> 01:48:55,072
Try.

1387
01:48:56,363 --> 01:48:58,558
Is there anything to read around here?

1388
01:49:00,003 --> 01:49:01,436
What would you like?

1389
01:49:01,523 --> 01:49:05,357
- Something to get my mind off my feet.
- There's something in there.

1390
01:49:19,883 --> 01:49:23,478
I tried to believe it was born in me...

1391
01:49:23,563 --> 01:49:27,158
and that I couldn't help it,
but that's not so.

1392
01:49:29,443 --> 01:49:30,842
A man has a choice.

1393
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:34,041
You used to say that was where
he was different from an animal.

1394
01:49:34,123 --> 01:49:35,636
You see, I remember.

1395
01:49:35,723 --> 01:49:39,272
A man has a choice,
and the choice is what makes him a man.

1396
01:49:41,523 --> 01:49:43,081
You see, I do remember.

1397
01:49:43,523 --> 01:49:47,072
- Look, I can't find any coffee.
- Get out!

1398
01:49:57,483 --> 01:49:58,438
Look.

1399
01:50:06,443 --> 01:50:09,560
Do something...

1400
01:50:11,683 --> 01:50:12,832
for me.

1401
01:50:12,923 --> 01:50:14,151
Yes.

1402
01:50:18,123 --> 01:50:21,035
That woman...

1403
01:50:21,643 --> 01:50:25,795
the nurse, can't stand her.

1404
01:50:27,923 --> 01:50:29,515
Get me another.

1405
01:50:44,723 --> 01:50:46,679
I can't stand her, either.

1406
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:38,242
What did he say?

1407
01:51:44,683 --> 01:51:47,959
He said, "Don't get anybody else."

1408
01:51:49,443 --> 01:51:51,877
He said, "You stay with me...

1409
01:51:53,203 --> 01:51:54,875
"and you take care of me."

1410
01:53:02,323 --> 01:53:03,312
