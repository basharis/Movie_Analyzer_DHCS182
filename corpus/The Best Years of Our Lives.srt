1
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,764
Announcing the departure of
American Airlines westbound flight 9.

2
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:20,519
Flight 9 now loading at gate three,
for immediate departure.

3
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:23,605
Yes, sir?
- Got anything to Boone City?

4
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,192
Three scheduled daily flights,
but there's no space available.

5
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:29,611
Would you care to make
a reservation? - Yes.

6
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:33,615
Your name, please?
- Derry. D- E- R- R- Y. Fred.

7
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,078
How long will it be? - We can
get you on flight 37 on the 19th.

8
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:43,000
I can't wait that long. I just got back
from overseas and I want to get home.

9
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:47,838
There's a long waiting list.
- I arranged to have my tickets here.

10
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:51,258
My name is Gibbons. George H.
Gibbons. - They're right here.

11
00:01:51,383 --> 00:01:53,552
Thank you.
- May we weigh your baggage?

12
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:58,015
Excuse me.
Put them right there, please. - Sorry.

13
00:02:01,518 --> 00:02:03,604
You might try the ATC, Captain.

14
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,649
Where are they? - Out the terminal,
and across the field.

15
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:09,276
Thanks.

16
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:13,489
You have 16lb excess baggage.
- That's all right. How much is it?

17
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:37,596
Righto, sir.

18
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:41,850
At ease, men.
Flight 93.

19
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:46,188
Flight 93 for Denver,
San Francisco and Seattle.

20
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:49,608
That flight has been
cancelled until further notice.

21
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,321
Yeah?
- You got anything for Detroit?

22
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:58,325
Nope. How about Cleveland?
- Cleveland?

23
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,828
OK.
- Fill this out.

24
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:04,081
Guess I'm going to Cleveland.
- lt's a nice town.

25
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:06,959
Yeah, but Detroit's where I live.

26
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:10,003
Sarge, what's the chances
of a ride to Boone City?

27
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:12,798
You got orders?

28
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:15,050
Sure.
- OK.

29
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:20,097
I haven't got anything now, but fill this
out and I'll call you if anything comes up.

30
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:22,266
OK.
I guess I'll wait.

31
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:29,523
I need a couple of men to give me
a hand with this out to a plane.

32
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:31,275
OK.
- Let's go.

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,443
Let's go, huh?

34
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:39,074
I bet this thing weighs a ton.
- What's the matter? Tired or something?

35
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,326
OK, let's go.
Out this way.

36
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:46,206
Fellas, take it easy down the stairs.

37
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:48,500
Got it?

38
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:52,629
Take it easy going down the stairs.
- Oh, my aching back.

39
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:55,424
Derry.

40
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:58,510
Derry. Captain Fred Derry.
- Coming!

41
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:02,806
Parrish. Homer Parrish.
- Here!

42
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:04,016
You Derry?
- Yeah.

43
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:05,350
Parrish?
- Right.

44
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:09,062
Got a call from Base Ops. There's
a B- 17 taking off for Boone City.

45
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:13,275
She's making a lot of stops, but
you'll get there tomorrow afternoon.

46
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,029
That's swell.
- OK, sign here.

47
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:20,282
Boy, it sure is great
to be going home.

48
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:23,994
Here you go, sailor.
- Sign on the dotted...

49
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:29,124
I'll do it for you.
- Think I can't spell my own name?

50
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:31,460
No, I...
I just thought that...

51
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:33,629
I know, sarge. Thanks.

52
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:45,265
You'd better hurry up out there,
cos she's taking off soon.

53
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,435
Right, thanks.
Come on, sailor.

54
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:53,232
Where's your stuff?
Excuse us, Corporal.

55
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:57,778
Boone City your home, sailor?
- Yes, Captain.

56
00:04:57,903 --> 00:05:00,239
Forget the rank, chum.
I'm out.

57
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:03,575
Whereabouts do you live in Boone?
- On West 17th Street.

58
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,744
Know where Jackson High is?
- Sure.

59
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:07,913
It's a couple of blocks past it.

60
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:22,052
Hiya, sarge.
- How are ya?

61
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,725
My name's Fred Derry.
- Al Stephenson.

62
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:32,062
And this is Homer...
What is it, Homer? - Parrish.

63
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,982
Glad to know you.
- You from Boone too?

64
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:37,901
Yeah, sure am.
- How long since you've been home?

65
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:40,404
A couple of centuries!

66
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,739
Let's sit in the radio
compartment for takeoff.

67
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:48,203
Then we'll get in the nose and get
a nice view of the good old USA.

68
00:05:56,795 --> 00:06:00,090
Look at that. Look at those
automobiles down there.

69
00:06:00,215 --> 00:06:02,801
You can see them so plain,
you can see the people.

70
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:05,846
Yeah, looks like we're
flying by road map.

71
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:09,808
Is this your first ride in one of these?
- This is my first plane ride.

72
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:15,397
I saw plenty of flying, all right.
I was on a CV. That's a flattop.

73
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:20,027
But I never knew things
looked so pretty from up here.

74
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:22,196
Sure is beautiful.

75
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:25,449
I never thought so.
This used to be my office.

76
00:06:25,574 --> 00:06:29,411
Bombardier, weren't you? - Yeah.
That's where the bombsight was.

77
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:32,206
I spent a lot of time
on my knees up there.

78
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,501
Praying?
- Yeah, that too.

79
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:40,923
Cigarette, Homer?
- Thanks.

80
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:43,383
It's all right,
I can get it.

81
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,643
Here, I've got a match, Captain.

82
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:08,325
Thanks.
- Thank you.

83
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,619
Anybody superstitious?
- No, go ahead.

84
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,788
Well, I am.

85
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:28,637
Boy, you ought to see
me open a bottle of beer.

86
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:31,473
You got nothing to worry about.
- Thanks.

87
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,394
I guess you saw a lot of action.
- No, I didn't see much of the war.

88
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,897
I mean, the way you fellas did.
- You trying to kid the army?

89
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:41,733
No, I was stationed in the
repair shop, below decks.

90
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:43,902
Oh, I was in plenty of battles.

91
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:47,281
But I never saw a Jap or
heard a shell coming at me.

92
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:51,535
When we were sunk, all I know is
there was a lot of fire and explosions.

93
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,039
I was ordered topsides and
overboard, and I was burned.

94
00:07:56,165 --> 00:08:00,836
When I came to I was on a cruiser,
and my hands were off.

95
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,463
After that I had it easy.
- Easy?!

96
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:07,009
That's what I said.
They took care of me fine.

97
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:09,178
They trained me to use these things.

98
00:08:09,303 --> 00:08:14,600
I can dial telephones, I can drive a car.
I can even put nickels in a jukebox.

99
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,768
I'm all right.
But...

100
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,151
But what, sailor?
- Well...

101
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:28,197
Well, you see,
I've got a girl.

102
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:35,662
She knows what happened to you?
- Sure. They all know.

103
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:39,249
But they don't know what
these things look like.

104
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:42,002
What's your girl's name, Homer?
- Wilma.

105
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:45,047
She and I went to
high school together.

106
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:49,009
I'll bet Wilma's a swell girl.
- She is.

107
00:08:49,134 --> 00:08:52,262
And it'll be all right, sailor.
You wait and see.

108
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:55,307
Yeah.
Wait and see.

109
00:08:55,432 --> 00:09:00,896
Wilma's only a kid. She's never
seen anything like these hooks.

110
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:09,238
Say, wait till I get home and
tell the folks about this trip.

111
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:14,535
I'm the first one in my family
that ever rode in an aeroplane.

112
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:40,602
Hey, Al.
- Yeah?

113
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:44,189
Remember what it felt like
when you went overseas?

114
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:46,567
As well as I remember
my own name.

115
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:48,735
I feel the same way now.

116
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,864
Only more so.

117
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:54,950
I know what you mean.

118
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:59,121
Just nervous out of the service,
I guess.

119
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:06,170
The thing that scares me most is that
everybody's gonna try to rehabilitate me.

120
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:11,758
All I want's a good job, a mild future,
and a house big enough for me and my wife.

121
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:16,513
Give me that much and
I'm rehabilitated like that.

122
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:19,474
I'd say that's not too much to ask.

123
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,937
Are you married, Al?
- Yep.

124
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:26,398
How long?

125
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:28,567
20 years.

126
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,820
20 years?!

127
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:37,159
Holy smoke!

128
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:43,874
We didn't even have 20
days before I went over.

129
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:47,836
I married a girl I met when
I was in training in Texas.

130
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:50,839
You and your wife will have
a chance to get acquainted.

131
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:53,008
Yeah.

132
00:10:57,846 --> 00:11:02,184
I wonder how Homer will
make out with that girl of his.

133
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:04,353
Wilma.

134
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,607
I hope Wilma is a swell girl.

135
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:06,665
The old home town
hasn't changed much.

136
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,917
No.

137
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:14,464
There's the golf course.
People are playing golf.

138
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,676
Just as if nothing had ever happened.

139
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:23,056
Hey, there's Jackson
High football field.

140
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:28,812
Boy, I sure would like to have a dollar for
every forward pass I threw down there.

141
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:33,150
Good old Jackson High.

142
00:12:37,696 --> 00:12:42,868
Hey, that must be the new airport.
- Yeah, we're turning into it now.

143
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:45,496
Holy smoke!

144
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,958
I never knew there
were so many planes.

145
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,045
And they're junking them.
- What?

146
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:56,340
Boy, oh boy.

147
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:59,009
What we could have
done with those in '43.

148
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,929
Yeah, I'll bet.

149
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:05,849
Some of 'em look brand- new.
From the factory to the scrapheap.

150
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:08,018
That's all they're good for now.

151
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:13,315
We gotta get out of the nose
while he sets her down.

152
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,494
There's the ballpark.

153
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:33,210
How are the Beavers doing this
season? - They're in sixth place.

154
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:36,171
Ah!
Still in second division!

155
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:06,827
Hey, there's Butch's Place.
- Butch's?

156
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,788
Gosh, Butch has got
himself a neon sign.

157
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:13,250
Been to Butch's Place?
Butch Engle that runs it is my uncle.

158
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:18,255
Swell guy. Only the family don't think
he's respectable because he sells liquor.

159
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,593
Best joint in town.
- Let's get together there sometime.

160
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:30,601
This is my street.

161
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:35,063
1517?
- lt's the fourth house from here.

162
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,818
I wonder if Wilma's home.

163
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:54,583
How about us going
back to Butch's Place?

164
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,586
We'll have a couple of drinks
and then we can go home.

165
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,755
You're home now, kid.

166
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:07,930
Well, so long.

167
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:09,807
Bye.
- So long, Homer.

168
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:19,525
Where next?
- Just a minute, bud.

169
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,783
It's Homer! Momma!
Daddy! Homer's here!

170
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:30,494
Wilma!
Wilma!

171
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:34,039
Wilma, come on over!

172
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:49,137
My boy.
- Oh, darling!

173
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:51,515
It's good to see you.

174
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,104
Isn't this wonderful?
- There's Wilma!

175
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,884
OK, let's go.

176
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,819
Well...
- Don't. I'll carry it.

177
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,573
What's the matter, Ma?

178
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,618
It's... it's nothing.

179
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:55,954
It's just that your ma's
so glad to see you home.

180
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,123
Yeah, I know.

181
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:20,020
You gotta hand it to the navy. They sure
trained that kid how to use those hooks.

182
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:25,943
They couldn't train him to put his arms
around his girl, to stroke her hair.

183
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:33,075
Is it the next turn up here?
- Yeah, the next turn on the left.

184
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,495
Hey, Fred,
why don't we drop you first?

185
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:40,290
No, you're next.

186
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:45,712
And we're not going back
to Butch's for a drink either.

187
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:48,715
Feel as if I were going
in to hit a beach.

188
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:09,528
Some barracks you got here.
What are you, a retired bootlegger?

189
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:13,365
Nothing as dignified as that.
I'm a banker.

190
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:17,828
How much?
- Take your hand out of your pocket.

191
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:21,707
You're outranked.
- Yes, sir, Captain, sir.

192
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:24,168
Good luck, chum.
- Thanks.

193
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,608
Yes, I will.

194
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:49,067
Yes, sir.

195
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:51,570
One moment, please.
One moment, please!

196
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:54,156
Who do you wish to see?
- Mrs Stephenson.

197
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:57,117
Just a minute.
I'll have to announce you first.

198
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:59,828
Put that phone down.
I'm her husband.

199
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:03,332
You're Mr Stephenson?
- Sergeant Stephenson.

200
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:07,044
What did you expect?
A four- star general?

201
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:11,590
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

202
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:15,177
Fourth floor.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:56,093
I'll get it, Peg.

204
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,391
Where's Mom?

205
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:05,394
Da...
- Sh.

206
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,814
Who's that at the door, Peggy?

207
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:11,942
Peggy!

208
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,111
Rob, who was...?

209
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:11,001
I look terrible.
- Who says so?

210
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:15,964
It isn't fair of you to bust in on us.
- I phoned you from Portland.

211
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:18,926
You said you wouldn't be home for...
- We were lucky.

212
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:22,721
We got a plane to Welburn. I thought
we were gonna get stuck there,

213
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:25,724
but we came right through.

214
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:28,268
Al, are you all right?
- Sure.

215
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:31,146
Are you all right?
- Course I am.

216
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:45,077
Let me look at you.
- Don't look now, I need a shave.

217
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:50,874
If you don't mind, Mom...

218
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:55,003
Dad... darling.

219
00:21:58,465 --> 00:22:01,552
I'll call the Kenworthys and
tell them we won't be over.

220
00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:03,720
The Kenworthys?
- Yes.

221
00:22:05,264 --> 00:22:08,934
My son.
And my daughter.

222
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,436
I don't recognise you.
What's happened?

223
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:14,898
Just a few years of normal growth.
Don't you approve?

224
00:22:15,023 --> 00:22:19,945
I don't know yet. I've got to have
more time to get to know you.

225
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,196
Hello?

226
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:26,702
Alice, this is Milly. I'm terribly sorry,
but we can't be over.

227
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:32,082
I mean,
I'm terribly happy.

228
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,295
You see, Al...

229
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:40,674
My husband!

230
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,302
Yes.
He's home.

231
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:46,096
Yes.

232
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:50,934
Yes.

233
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,257
Freddy!
- Hortense.

234
00:23:22,382 --> 00:23:24,968
Well, say!

235
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:26,220
Pat!

236
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:29,598
Pat, it's Freddy.
He's home again!

237
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:33,477
Hello, Pop. - I wish we'd
known you were coming.

238
00:23:33,602 --> 00:23:36,438
We'd have had the
place kinda cleaned up.

239
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:41,819
Well? Haven't you got anything
to say to your own son?

240
00:23:41,944 --> 00:23:44,988
Glad to see you, my boy.
- Look at him, Pat.

241
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:49,451
Look at your hero son. And look at all
those beautiful ribbons on his chest.

242
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:53,664
Go on, Freddy, tell your father how you
got those ribbons and what they mean.

243
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:55,874
Where's Marie?
- Marie?

244
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:59,002
Yeah. Is she out?
- Marie isn't here, Freddy.

245
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:01,839
Will she be back soon?
- She's not living with us.

246
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:06,009
She took an apartment downtown.
- Why didn't anybody write me about it?

247
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:09,930
We were afraid it might worry you,
you being so far away.

248
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:14,059
It was inconvenient for Marie,
living here, after she took that job.

249
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:17,521
But we forwarded all your letters
and the allotment cheques.

250
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:19,690
She took a job?
Where?

251
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:23,152
Uh... some nightclub.
I don't know just which one.

252
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:25,779
The poor girl works till all hours.

253
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:31,326
Where does she live? - Uh...
Grandview Arms on Pine Street.

254
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:34,288
But there's nothing to worry about.
Marie's fine.

255
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:38,584
We saw her last Christmas. She
brought us some beautiful presents.

256
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:42,337
Marie's a good- hearted girl. - You
know what time she goes to work?

257
00:24:42,462 --> 00:24:46,466
Uh... well,
about supper time, I imagine.

258
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:52,306
Do you mind if I leave my stuff here?
I'll pick it up later.

259
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:55,392
Sure, but aren't you gonna
stay and have a bite to eat?

260
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:57,978
No, thank you, Hortense.

261
00:24:58,103 --> 00:25:01,773
Well, uh... so long, Pop.
I'll be back.

262
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:04,651
Well, it's...
I'm glad to have you home, my boy.

263
00:25:04,776 --> 00:25:07,321
It's good to be home, Pop. Bye.

264
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:13,869
Here, a cap.

265
00:25:15,996 --> 00:25:18,457
Here's a samurai sword, Rob.

266
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,877
Thanks very much, Dad.

267
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:28,008
And here's a flag I found
on a dead Jap soldier.

268
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:31,637
All that writing is good- luck
messages from his relatives.

269
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:36,892
Yes, I know. The Japanese attach a lot of
importance to their family relationship.

270
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:40,479
Yeah.
Yeah, entirely different from us.

271
00:25:40,604 --> 00:25:43,023
You were at Hiroshima, weren't you?
- Mm- hm.

272
00:25:43,148 --> 00:25:49,446
Did you notice any of the effects of
radioactivity on the people who survived?

273
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:51,990
No, I didn't.
Should I have?

274
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:55,160
We've been having lectures
in atomic energy at school.

275
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:59,456
Mr McLaglen, our physics teacher,
he says that we've reached the point

276
00:25:59,581 --> 00:26:05,462
where the whole human race has either
got to find a way to live together, or else...

277
00:26:05,587 --> 00:26:09,132
Or else.
- That's right. Or else.

278
00:26:09,258 --> 00:26:15,347
When you combine atomic energy with jet
propulsion and radar and guided missiles,

279
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:17,641
just think of the...

280
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:20,435
Oh, you're just kidding me, Dad.

281
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:24,356
You've been to all these places
and you've seen everything.

282
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:26,525
I've seen nothing.

283
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:31,989
I should have stayed home and
found out what was really going on.

284
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:34,158
I finished the dishes.

285
00:26:34,283 --> 00:26:37,828
Why do you have to do that?
Is this the maid's night out?

286
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:41,748
Our maid took a night out three years
ago and we haven't seen her since.

287
00:26:41,874 --> 00:26:45,919
But everything's all right because I
took a course in Domestic Science.

288
00:26:46,044 --> 00:26:51,383
What's happened to this family? All this
atomic energy and scientific efficiency...

289
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:55,012
It was the war! You heard about that.
- Yeah.

290
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:57,181
All those problems
on the home front.

291
00:26:57,306 --> 00:26:59,725
We used to read about
'em in Stars and Stripes.

292
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,311
We felt awfully sorry for the civilians.

293
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:08,734
You don't have to worry about us, though.
We can handle the problems. We're tough.

294
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:11,528
Rob, haven't you any homework?

295
00:27:12,905 --> 00:27:14,823
Oh, sure.

296
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:17,618
Night, Dad. - I don't see
why you have to go now.

297
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:21,455
Rob, aren't you going to take the
souvenirs Father brought you?

298
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,457
Oh, yes.

299
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:27,586
Thanks an awful lot, Dad,
for these... things.

300
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:30,255
Good night. See you in the morning.
- Night.

301
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:34,343
Night, Mom.
- Good night, darling.

302
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:39,807
Nice to have you around, Dad.
You'll get us back to normal.

303
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:42,935
Or maybe go nuts myself.

304
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:58,909
What do you think of the children?

305
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:01,620
The children?

306
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:06,291
I don't recognise them.
They've grown so old.

307
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:09,920
I tried to stop them, to keep them
just as they were when you left,

308
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:12,172
but they got away from me.

309
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,477
I guess Peggy has
a lot of boyfriends.

310
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:27,646
She's very popular.

311
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:32,818
Is she concentrating on anyone?
- She hasn't told me of anyone.

312
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:37,990
But you've, uh... told her all
the things she ought to know?

313
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:42,327
What, for instance?

314
00:28:46,582 --> 00:28:48,625
Well, have you?

315
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,799
She's worked two years in a hospital.
She knows more than you or I ever will.

316
00:28:56,884 --> 00:29:00,888
Want a cigarette?
- Have you forgotten? I don't smoke.

317
00:29:01,013 --> 00:29:03,974
Sorry.
- lt's all right, darling.

318
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:09,271
Yeah, it's frightening.

319
00:29:09,396 --> 00:29:11,440
What is?

320
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:14,443
Youth.

321
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:16,862
Didn't you meet young
people in the army?

322
00:29:16,987 --> 00:29:20,616
No, they were all old men,
like me.

323
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:22,534
Yes...

324
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:25,537
It's terrible to be old,
isn't it?

325
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:32,878
Why don't you sit down and relax?
- I'm perfectly relaxed standing up.

326
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:36,715
Is there such a thing as
a drink in this house?

327
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,884
I'll see.

328
00:29:52,689 --> 00:29:57,319
We haven't got bacon for Dad's breakfast.
I'll go out first thing and try to get some.

329
00:29:57,444 --> 00:29:59,780
Is this all the liquor we have left?

330
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:01,949
Gosh, I'm afraid so.

331
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:07,162
I wish he'd given us some warning
he was going to get here today.

332
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,581
Don't worry, Mom.

333
00:30:09,706 --> 00:30:14,378
I mean, so that we could have
gotten in some supplies of things.

334
00:30:15,462 --> 00:30:19,216
Oh, Mother.
I know it's a little difficult, but...

335
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:23,053
that's only because Dad's
so crazy about you,

336
00:30:23,178 --> 00:30:27,057
and he's been away so long
and missed you so terribly.

337
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:29,768
He can't just walk in and
immediately pick up...

338
00:30:29,893 --> 00:30:33,730
Hey, I got a wonderful idea. Let's
go out on the town, the three of us.

339
00:30:33,856 --> 00:30:35,482
Tonight?
- Yes, tonight.

340
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:38,235
To celebrate the old man's
homecoming. - Not me.

341
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,612
No, no, no. You too.
The three of us.

342
00:30:40,737 --> 00:30:43,157
I want to do something,
see something.

343
00:30:43,282 --> 00:30:46,076
I've been in jungles and
around savages so long,

344
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:49,371
I gotta find out I'm back
in civilisation again.

345
00:31:10,225 --> 00:31:12,144
Be- bop, be- bop

346
00:31:12,478 --> 00:31:15,856
Be- bop a- ree- bop

347
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:18,358
Rupert, another one in here.

348
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,882
I'll tell you, as I see it, we're headed
for bad times in this country.

349
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:46,595
Of course, we're in the backwash of the
war boom, but the tide is running out fast.

350
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,891
Next year, we'll see widespread
depression and unemployment.

351
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:53,101
Oh, have a cigar?

352
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:55,896
No, thanks.
I've got my pipe.

353
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:59,024
Homer? Didn't you contract
the tobacco habit in the navy?

354
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:02,444
Just cigarettes,
Mr Cameron. Thanks.

355
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:07,115
Wilma tells us you
were in the Philippines.

356
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:10,661
I was around there, Mrs Cameron,
but I never saw anything.

357
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:15,541
Did you meet General MacArthur?
- No, I didn't get to meet him.

358
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:19,503
I've got a light, Mr Cameron.
- No, that's all right.

359
00:32:19,628 --> 00:32:21,672
Got it.

360
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:30,305
Luella.
- Yes, Dad?

361
00:32:35,978 --> 00:32:38,939
I've always thought he's
such a handsome man.

362
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:41,108
Who?
- General MacArthur.

363
00:32:42,151 --> 00:32:43,902
Oh...

364
00:32:44,987 --> 00:32:48,448
May I help you with that,
Mrs Parrish? - No, you sit right down.

365
00:32:48,574 --> 00:32:51,410
Lemonade, Mrs Cameron?
- Thank you very much.

366
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:54,705
Thought about getting a job, Homer?
- Well, I...

367
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,417
Father, it's much too soon for
Homer to be thinking about a job.

368
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,586
He's just out of the hospital.

369
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:06,550
Yes, but a few months from now the same
opportunities won't exist that exist today.

370
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:10,762
You might think about my business
- insurance. We've taken on veterans.

371
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:16,643
They make good salesmen, men who
have suffered some kind of disability.

372
00:33:16,768 --> 00:33:21,940
Come down to the office one of
these days, we'll talk it over.

373
00:33:22,983 --> 00:33:26,445
I'm sorry, Mom.
- That's quite all right, Homer.

374
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:31,283
It won't hurt the carpet a bit.
Luella, go and get me a dishrag.

375
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:34,495
There's another one for you, Homer.

376
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:37,789
Wilma will hold it for you.

377
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:43,921
No, thanks. If you don't mind, I think
I'll go out and walk around a bit.

378
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,477
Where's Homer?

379
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:03,357
He went out.

380
00:34:07,277 --> 00:34:10,197
It's home, boys, home,
home we ought to be

381
00:34:10,322 --> 00:34:14,910
Home, boys, home,
back in God's country

382
00:34:16,411 --> 00:34:18,872
Pick- Up Caf?
There it is, driver. Stop here.

383
00:34:18,997 --> 00:34:22,459
Don't you think it's time to go
home to bed and get some sleep?

384
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:27,047
Absolutely. Sleep. But first we've got
to stop and have one last little drink.

385
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:29,466
No arguments.
One drink.

386
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:32,136
Come on in, driver,
and have one with us.

387
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:00,789
Hey, Homer!

388
00:35:00,914 --> 00:35:03,208
It's good to see you, kid.

389
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:06,712
Your friend told me you were home,
but I didn't expect you...

390
00:35:06,837 --> 00:35:08,672
Hiya, Captain!

391
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:11,633
Hiya, Homer,
my old shipmate! Sit down.

392
00:35:11,758 --> 00:35:15,804
So you took my advice and came to
Butch's? Come on, let's have a drink.

393
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:17,598
Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Steve!

394
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:19,850
Am I happy to see
you back home again.

395
00:35:19,975 --> 00:35:23,645
Go ahead, shake, pal.
It won't bite you.

396
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,858
What'll you have? - I've dreamed
of hearing that question.

397
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:31,361
Before I went in the navy Butch
would never let me drink liquor.

398
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:33,947
He'd read me lectures
on the curse of drink.

399
00:35:34,072 --> 00:35:36,325
But it's different now.
I'm a veteran.

400
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,744
Give me a whiskey, Steve. Straight.

401
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:41,997
How about it, Butch?
- Draw a beer for the navy.

402
00:35:42,122 --> 00:35:44,333
Butch, I ordered whiskey.
- Beer.

403
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,459
Beer.

404
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:50,005
I'm gonna take my trade to some other
joint where I don't have relatives.

405
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,342
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you home with the folks?

406
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:56,678
Well, they... they went to
bed and I wasn't sleepy,

407
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:59,890
so I thought "Why not come
down and see Butch?"

408
00:36:00,015 --> 00:36:02,726
Glad you did, Homer.

409
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:05,187
Well, here's to you, Butch.

410
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:10,442
How am I doing?

411
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:14,488
Kid, you're doing great.
- Thanks.

412
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:16,532
Where did you leave Al?

413
00:36:16,657 --> 00:36:19,910
Al's home in the swankiest
apartment house in town.

414
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:22,538
We'll never see him again.

415
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:25,290
Say, this is the best
place we've been yet!

416
00:36:25,415 --> 00:36:27,918
Hey, that's Al.

417
00:36:28,043 --> 00:36:32,506
Hey, where you been?
We were just talking about you.

418
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:35,968
Oh, my aching back.

419
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,762
Hey, Milly. Peggy.
Step up and meet the gang.

420
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:41,056
This is Homer, this is Fred.
- How do you do?

421
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:46,770
Homer and I were together at the Battle
of Lingayen Gulf, only we didn't know it!

422
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:48,689
Hiya, bud.
- How do you do?

423
00:36:48,814 --> 00:36:51,441
Al, this is my uncle Butch.
- Bu...?

424
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:55,320
Oh! I hear you got a new
neon sign, huh? Good for you.

425
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:59,283
Now the party can really get
started, eh? - This way, please.

426
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:02,161
Let's sit. Milly, come on.
- Here's a good booth.

427
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,664
Fred... Sit down. Fred, where's
your wife? I want to meet her.

428
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:10,127
I haven't been able to find her.
She works in some nightclub.

429
00:37:10,252 --> 00:37:12,754
We'll find it, Fred,
before this night is out.

430
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,591
We'll deploy our forces and
comb the town. Won't we?

431
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:17,468
By all means.

432
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:19,761
We got the navy to convoy us.
Huh?

433
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:23,307
First, Homer lost his hands.
He's got those hooks instead.

434
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:26,852
They don't worry him, so they
don't need to worry anybody else.

435
00:37:26,977 --> 00:37:29,354
Right.
- Now let's get seriously to work.

436
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,483
Telephone. - Thanks.
Give them anything they want.

437
00:37:32,608 --> 00:37:35,068
Any kind of beer.
- What'll it be, folks?

438
00:37:35,194 --> 00:37:36,737
How are you?
- Hiya.

439
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:39,364
Nice to see you. Looking well.
- Hello.

440
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,366
A little grey...

441
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:45,913
Well, cheers. Cheers.
- Cheers!

442
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,998
Homer.
Homer.

443
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:50,417
OK, Butch.

444
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:52,586
Aren't you drinking?

445
00:37:55,964 --> 00:37:58,133
Excuse me, folks.
- Sure, Homer.

446
00:38:05,432 --> 00:38:08,727
Gee, Butch,
it's swell to hear you playing again.

447
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:12,231
How about "Lazy River"?
Remember that?

448
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:17,110
Sit down, Homer.

449
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:26,537
Wilma phoned.
- Wilma?

450
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:29,706
What did she want?
- You.

451
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:34,002
Oh, why can't they
leave a guy alone?

452
00:38:34,127 --> 00:38:37,172
Because they're fond of you,
that's why.

453
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:40,092
What made you leave the
house and get them worried?

454
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:43,554
Oh, they...
they got me nervous.

455
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,933
How? - lt's nothing.
I don't wanna talk about it.

456
00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:50,727
How'd they get you nervous?

457
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:52,813
Well, they...

458
00:38:52,938 --> 00:38:58,944
They keep staring at these hooks,
or else they keep staring away from 'em.

459
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:02,531
You mean whatever
they do is wrong.

460
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:07,452
Why don't they understand that all I want
is to be treated like everybody else?

461
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,663
Take Pop,
for instance.

462
00:39:09,788 --> 00:39:14,084
He was cleaning his pipe,
like I've seen him do a million times.

463
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:17,963
All of a sudden he got conscious
that he had hands and I didn't,

464
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:22,718
and he... he stopped cleaning his
pipe and he tried to hide his hands,

465
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:25,596
like he was guilty or something.

466
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:32,728
Give 'em time, kid.
They'll catch on.

467
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:37,065
You know, your folks'll get used to
you and you'll get used to them.

468
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:40,027
Then everything'll settle down nicely.

469
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:42,488
Unless we have another war.

470
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:50,329
Then none of us have to worry, because
we'll all be blown to bits the first day.

471
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:56,293
So cheer up, huh?

472
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,797
Hey, Butch.

473
00:39:59,922 --> 00:40:03,383
You know "Among
My Souvenirs", huh?

474
00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:06,845
There's nothing left for me

475
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,014
Shh.

476
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:30,494
Shall we dance?
- That's a charming idea.

477
00:40:34,706 --> 00:40:36,959
Do you remember this tune?

478
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:35,434
Nice to see the young folks
enjoying themselves, isn't it?

479
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,188
So you're Al's daughter.

480
00:41:39,313 --> 00:41:43,108
Yes. I've been that as
long as I can remember.

481
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:47,112
You don't seem like Al's daughter.

482
00:41:48,197 --> 00:41:52,826
Actually, I'm not.
He's my son by a previous marriage.

483
00:41:55,996 --> 00:41:58,248
What did you say your name was?
- Peggy.

484
00:41:58,373 --> 00:42:01,001
Peggy. My name's Fred.
How do you do?

485
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:02,753
How do you do?

486
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:07,132
No, you... Oh, no.

487
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,629
You're a bewitching little creature.

488
00:42:45,754 --> 00:42:51,426
In a way, you remind me of my wife.
- But you never told me you're married.

489
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:55,973
Oh, yeah. I've got a little woman and
two kiddies back there in the States.

490
00:42:56,098 --> 00:43:00,352
But let's not think of them now.
- Oh, you're so right.

491
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,021
This night belongs only to us.

492
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,699
That's the type of thing people
ought to be thinking about.

493
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,702
All right,
I promise I'll get right to work on it.

494
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,997
And there's one thing I've
been wanting to ask you.

495
00:43:20,122 --> 00:43:24,334
You ask it, Peggy.
You mustn't feel shy with me.

496
00:43:26,211 --> 00:43:28,338
Why don't you call your wife?

497
00:43:29,423 --> 00:43:32,593
I don't know her number.
I couldn't find it in the phone book.

498
00:43:32,718 --> 00:43:36,054
Phone book?! We don't
need to do any telephoning.

499
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,223
We're all set.

500
00:43:38,348 --> 00:43:41,143
What you need is a drink.

501
00:43:41,268 --> 00:43:43,896
Good night, everybody.
I'm going home. - Why?

502
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:48,400
I've got to. Butch is gonna drive me.
- Oh, no, no.

503
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,486
No, you can't...
- lt's quite all right.

504
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:53,155
Don't leave. I'll be right back.
- Good night.

505
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,659
Good night.
- Poor kid. He's got to go home.

506
00:43:57,784 --> 00:43:59,953
Doesn't that put any
ideas in your head?

507
00:44:00,078 --> 00:44:02,122
Yes.

508
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,834
I'd love to.

509
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,924
Lights out, Steve.

510
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:16,512
Oh!
Ho- ho- ho!

511
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:18,931
Where do we go next,
old pal, old pal?

512
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,099
Just follow me,
old pal.

513
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,982
Step.

514
00:44:29,107 --> 00:44:31,610
Good night, Al.
- Good night. Nice party.

515
00:44:37,616 --> 00:44:39,993
This it, Fred?

516
00:44:40,118 --> 00:44:42,162
It looks like it.

517
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:46,667
Ooh, silly.

518
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:50,087
Good night, Milly. Many thanks
for a most enjoyable evening.

519
00:44:50,212 --> 00:44:52,589
Good night, Fred.
- Good night, Al.

520
00:44:52,714 --> 00:44:54,758
Best of luck to you.

521
00:44:57,469 --> 00:45:00,848
I'll give him your message.
- You do that.

522
00:45:00,973 --> 00:45:05,435
And good night to you,
Peggy. It has indeed been a pleasure.

523
00:45:05,561 --> 00:45:08,438
Yes, Fred. See you soon.
- By all means.

524
00:45:08,564 --> 00:45:10,274
Ooh!

525
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:12,442
I beg your pardon.

526
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:15,529
Good night.

527
00:45:17,322 --> 00:45:19,950
We'd better wait and
see if he gets in.

528
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:33,297
I don't think he even knows
if this is the right place.

529
00:45:58,363 --> 00:45:59,531
Come on.

530
00:46:01,116 --> 00:46:03,160
Up...

531
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,544
Where are we all going now? - Don't
ask. We want it to be a surprise.

532
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,947
They make a lovely couple,
don't they? - Yeah.

533
00:46:40,072 --> 00:46:43,450
I think they'll be
very happy together.

534
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:13,689
Who are you?
- Don't you remember? I'm Peggy.

535
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:18,318
Oh, yes.
Peggy.

536
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:22,865
I'm not that Peggy.

537
00:47:24,283 --> 00:47:26,326
That's too bad.

538
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:36,146
As I remember, when you lie
flat on your back you snore.

539
00:48:38,065 --> 00:48:40,609
Where's your hand?

540
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:46,490
Give me your hand.

541
00:48:49,034 --> 00:48:51,036
..my souvenirs

542
00:48:51,411 --> 00:48:53,455
..my souvenirs

543
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,041
..my souvenirs

544
00:49:13,392 --> 00:49:17,146
Is Fred all right?
- Yes. He's all right.

545
00:49:17,271 --> 00:49:20,399
You'll be comfortable here.
- Sure, Mom. Night.

546
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,568
Night, dear.

547
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,407
Night.
- Night.

548
00:51:09,174 --> 00:51:11,218
Bandits at four o'clock.

549
00:51:15,764 --> 00:51:17,808
It's all right, buddy.

550
00:51:19,393 --> 00:51:21,436
You got him.

551
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:24,731
He's hit.

552
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:30,279
She's on fire.
She's on fire!

553
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:36,994
The fire's spreading.
It's Gadorsky.

554
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,372
There goes number four.
She's breaking formation.

555
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,458
Watch out for fighters.

556
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:45,878
It's spread to the wing.
The wing's on fire!

557
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:49,965
She's out of control.
She's out of control!

558
00:51:50,966 --> 00:51:53,093
She's going down!

559
00:51:53,218 --> 00:51:55,053
Hey, you guys, jump!

560
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,222
Get outta there!
Bail out!

561
00:51:57,347 --> 00:52:00,267
Gadorsky!
Gadorsky, get out of that plane!

562
00:52:00,392 --> 00:52:02,936
Two chutes open.

563
00:52:03,061 --> 00:52:05,105
Three.

564
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,940
The rest of you guys...
- Fred.

565
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:08,942
..get out!
- Fred, wake up!

566
00:52:09,067 --> 00:52:11,153
Gadorsky! Gadorsky!
- Wake up!

567
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:14,656
She's burning up! Get out! Get out!
- Fred! Fred, wake up!

568
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:18,494
She's burning up!
She's gonna hit. Look out!

569
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:21,955
It's all right, Fred.
Go back to sleep.

570
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:24,666
Go back to sleep.

571
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:26,835
Go back to sleep, Fred.

572
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:35,385
There's nothing to be afraid of.

573
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:40,766
All you have to do is...
go to sleep and rest.

574
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,770
Go to sleep.

575
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,773
Go to sleep, Fred.

576
00:52:49,525 --> 00:52:52,778
Go to sleep and rest.

577
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,326
Go to sleep, Fred.

578
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:01,495
Go to sleep.

579
00:53:03,372 --> 00:53:05,749
All you have to do is rest.

580
00:53:09,169 --> 00:53:11,213
Go to sleep.

581
00:54:33,378 --> 00:54:36,965
Oh, I'm terribly sorry I woke you up.

582
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:39,384
Oh, that's all right.
But...

583
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,387
I know.
You're about to say "Where am I?"

584
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:46,892
I'll tell you later, Fred.
You can sleep as long as you want.

585
00:55:50,622 --> 00:55:53,083
Did he fly 17 s or 24s?

586
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:56,128
I don't know.

587
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:59,047
What group was he with?
- He didn't say.

588
00:56:00,132 --> 00:56:02,843
Well, what did you two talk about?

589
00:56:02,968 --> 00:56:06,138
Rob, you'd better hurry up.
You'll be late for school.

590
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:08,223
Holy Moses!

591
00:56:08,348 --> 00:56:10,225
I'll see you later.
Bye.

592
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:26,533
Oh, excuse me, Captain.
I'm Rob Stephenson, Peggy's brother.

593
00:56:26,658 --> 00:56:29,495
She's in there in the kitchen,
fixing your breakfast.

594
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,663
I've gotta run.
Goodbye.

595
00:56:40,714 --> 00:56:42,925
Hello.
- Hello.

596
00:56:44,676 --> 00:56:46,720
Sit down.

597
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:53,769
Here, this may help.
- Thanks.

598
00:56:53,894 --> 00:56:55,938
Sit down.

599
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:00,776
You're Peggy,
aren't you?

600
00:57:00,901 --> 00:57:02,945
For the last time, yes.

601
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:06,406
Want some eggs?
- You think I can take 'em?

602
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:09,284
Sure, they'll be good for you.

603
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:12,246
Like 'em scrambled?
- Any way you cook 'em.

604
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:14,414
Good.

605
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,085
Sleep all right?

606
00:57:20,295 --> 00:57:22,422
Wonderful.

607
00:57:22,548 --> 00:57:24,591
That's good.

608
00:57:29,555 --> 00:57:31,932
Can I help you with
any of that business?

609
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:35,435
You can pour the coffee
if you want some.

610
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:39,940
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

611
00:57:40,065 --> 00:57:42,484
No.

612
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:44,862
Where did you sleep last night?

613
00:57:44,987 --> 00:57:47,698
On the couch.

614
00:57:47,823 --> 00:57:51,118
That's terrible.
- What's terrible?

615
00:57:51,243 --> 00:57:56,874
I should have had enough sense to go to
a hotel and not come here, bothering you.

616
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:59,126
You didn't bother anybody, Fred.

617
00:57:59,251 --> 00:58:01,962
We're very glad to have you here.

618
00:58:02,087 --> 00:58:05,883
Besides, you couldn't have
gotten a room in a hotel.

619
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:09,261
Did I get out of line with you?

620
00:58:10,345 --> 00:58:12,389
No.
Not really.

621
00:58:13,432 --> 00:58:16,935
That's good.
Cos, you see, I'm married.

622
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,104
Yes, I know.

623
00:58:21,482 --> 00:58:25,027
I must have got pretty
plastered last night.

624
00:58:25,152 --> 00:58:27,488
You had nothing on my dad.

625
00:58:27,613 --> 00:58:29,698
Your dad?
Who's he?

626
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:34,161
Don't you remember Al?

627
00:58:35,662 --> 00:58:39,082
Oh, Al.
Yeah, good old Al.

628
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:42,377
Where is he?
- Still asleep, I guess.

629
00:58:44,379 --> 00:58:47,341
So you're Al's daughter.

630
00:58:47,466 --> 00:58:50,135
You've got it all straight now.

631
00:58:51,637 --> 00:58:55,265
I feel a lot better.
- That's good.

632
00:58:57,434 --> 00:59:00,479
Are you married, Peggy?
- No.

633
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:03,857
You've hardly had time. You must
have been engaged, though.

634
00:59:03,982 --> 00:59:05,818
No.

635
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:09,822
Why not? What's the matter
with the guys around here?

636
00:59:09,947 --> 00:59:13,659
I guess the best of 'em
are already married.

637
00:59:19,832 --> 00:59:22,584
Good morning, Fred.
- Good morning, Mrs, uh...

638
00:59:22,709 --> 00:59:26,004
Milly's the name.
- Thanks, Milly.

639
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:28,298
When Al wakes up,
tell him how much I...

640
00:59:28,423 --> 00:59:31,802
You're not going? You haven't
even finished your breakfast.

641
00:59:31,927 --> 00:59:37,057
I haven't got much of an appetite.
Besides, I've got to get downtown.

642
00:59:37,182 --> 00:59:40,060
Maybe now I can get
into where my wife lives.

643
00:59:40,185 --> 00:59:45,274
I'll drive you, Fred. I've got to get to
work at the hospital. I'll just be a minute.

644
00:59:45,399 --> 00:59:48,944
I must've acted disgracefully
last night. - No.

645
00:59:49,069 --> 00:59:53,907
You just fell in with bad company
at Butch's and got stinking.

646
00:59:54,032 --> 00:59:57,911
You see, the whole trouble was,
I couldn't find Marie - that's my wife.

647
00:59:58,036 --> 01:00:00,289
I didn't know she had
a job in a nightclub.

648
01:00:00,414 --> 01:00:05,502
Could happen to anyone. If Al had come
home later, we wouldn't have been in.

649
01:00:05,627 --> 01:00:08,922
He wouldn't have known
where we were. - How is Al?

650
01:00:09,047 --> 01:00:11,967
We don't know yet.
- Ready, Fred.

651
01:00:12,092 --> 01:00:15,888
Well, when he wakes up you can tell
him I think he's a pretty lucky guy.

652
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:19,433
Thank you, Fred. - Goodbye.
Thanks a lot for everything.

653
01:00:19,558 --> 01:00:20,976
Goodbye.

654
01:00:21,101 --> 01:00:23,145
Bye, Mom.
- Bye, dear.

655
01:02:44,953 --> 01:02:47,372
Among my souvenirs

656
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:49,541
Among my...

657
01:02:58,467 --> 01:03:03,013
What'd you do before the war, Fred?
- I was a fountain attendant.

658
01:03:03,138 --> 01:03:05,182
A what?
- Soda jerk.

659
01:03:06,225 --> 01:03:08,268
Oh.
- Surprised?

660
01:03:09,269 --> 01:03:11,480
Yes, a little.

661
01:03:11,605 --> 01:03:14,566
I'll bet you mixed up a
fine ice- cream soda.

662
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:17,986
You're darn right.
I was an expert behind that fountain.

663
01:03:18,111 --> 01:03:22,032
I'd toss a scoop of ice cream in the
air, adjust for velocity, altitude,

664
01:03:22,157 --> 01:03:25,118
and - wham!
- in the cone every time.

665
01:03:25,244 --> 01:03:28,705
I figure that's where I really
learned to drop bombs.

666
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:32,042
What do you think you'll do now?

667
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:35,546
I'm not going back to that drugstore.

668
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:41,176
Somehow or other, I can't figure myself
getting excited about a root- beer float.

669
01:03:41,301 --> 01:03:43,679
I don't know just what I will do,

670
01:03:43,804 --> 01:03:48,016
but I'm gonna take plenty
of time looking around.

671
01:03:49,184 --> 01:03:55,023
I guess after all the places you've been,
Boone City looks pretty dreary to you.

672
01:03:55,149 --> 01:03:58,318
Not from where I'm sitting right now.

673
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:02,906
That's not just a line.
I really meant it.

674
01:04:28,223 --> 01:04:30,767
Who's that?
- lt's me, Milly.

675
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:36,064
I brought your breakfast.
- Oh! Thanks.

676
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:41,737
Didn't think you'd be up for hours. - I
had a dream. I dreamt I was home.

677
01:04:41,862 --> 01:04:45,491
I've had that same dream
hundreds of times before.

678
01:04:45,616 --> 01:04:49,870
This time I wanted to
find out if it's really true.

679
01:04:49,995 --> 01:04:52,623
Am I really home?
- Looks like it.

680
01:04:52,748 --> 01:04:58,962
And you're going to be royally treated.
You're having breakfast in bed.

681
01:05:00,088 --> 01:05:04,885
I seem to have a vague recollection that
we had a couple of children. Is that right?

682
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:08,555
That's right.
- Whatever became of them?

683
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,267
Rob's gone to school and Peggy's
driving downtown with Fred.

684
01:05:12,392 --> 01:05:14,520
Fred?
Oh.

685
01:05:14,645 --> 01:05:17,022
Oh, yeah, Fred.

686
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:19,191
He's a great guy.

687
01:05:23,737 --> 01:05:25,781
All right?

688
01:05:30,744 --> 01:05:34,331
There's your breakfast.
I have work to do.

689
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:53,225
Well, it was nice
knowing you, Peggy.

690
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:57,437
That sounds like a
permanent goodbye.

691
01:05:57,563 --> 01:05:59,815
You never know.

692
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:03,318
You and your wife must
come up to dinner.

693
01:06:03,443 --> 01:06:05,821
That'd be fine.

694
01:06:05,946 --> 01:06:08,532
Oh, there's one thing more.

695
01:06:08,657 --> 01:06:12,327
About that dream I had last night.
I've had it before.

696
01:06:12,453 --> 01:06:14,371
I'm sorry I bothered you with it.
- I...

697
01:06:14,496 --> 01:06:19,710
But you were very kind, and you
didn't even mention it this morning.

698
01:06:19,835 --> 01:06:23,464
As a matter of fact,
you've been swell about everything.

699
01:06:23,589 --> 01:06:26,091
They ought to put you
in mass production.

700
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:28,552
Goodbye, Fred.
- Bye.

701
01:06:30,345 --> 01:06:32,848
Maybe I'd better wait
and see if you get in.

702
01:06:32,973 --> 01:06:35,017
Maybe that's a good idea.

703
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:52,511
Bye.

704
01:08:18,579 --> 01:08:21,957
All right!
All right!

705
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:25,794
Say, what's the big i...?

706
01:08:25,919 --> 01:08:28,213
Freddy!
- Hiya, babe.

707
01:08:32,301 --> 01:08:34,970
Freddy, darling,
why didn't you let me know?

708
01:08:35,095 --> 01:08:38,390
You didn't give me time to fix
my face. - You look all right.

709
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:42,478
Oh, Freddy, darling, I'm so excited!
I can't believe it's you!

710
01:08:42,603 --> 01:08:46,356
Come on in, honey,
where I can look at you.

711
01:08:46,482 --> 01:08:48,525
Oh, you're marvellous!

712
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:52,196
All those ribbons! You gotta
tell me what they all mean.

713
01:08:52,321 --> 01:08:54,364
But not now.

714
01:08:56,283 --> 01:08:59,536
Let me look at you.
But how did you know I was here?

715
01:08:59,661 --> 01:09:03,665
I got in yesterday, went to Pop's
house... - Yesterday?! Why didn't...?

716
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:07,753
I came here, but you'd gone to work.
I went from one nightclub to another.

717
01:09:07,878 --> 01:09:10,172
You were looking for me?
- For my wife.

718
01:09:10,297 --> 01:09:12,633
Well, you've found her now.

719
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:40,410
I wonder how Fred's getting along.

720
01:09:40,536 --> 01:09:42,663
Fred's able to take care of himself.

721
01:09:42,788 --> 01:09:48,418
I'm not so sure. It isn't easy for air force
glamour boys when they get grounded.

722
01:09:48,544 --> 01:09:54,007
When you've been in the infantry,
any change is bound to be an improvement.

723
01:09:54,133 --> 01:09:56,677
Stop fussing around and
sit down and talk to me.

724
01:09:56,802 --> 01:09:59,596
All right, Sergeant.
Gosh, you've got tough.

725
01:09:59,721 --> 01:10:01,890
Is this all the cream?
- That's all.

726
01:10:02,015 --> 01:10:05,644
Fine situation when a man can't
get enough to eat in his own home.

727
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:07,896
Look at my pants.
- What about them?

728
01:10:08,021 --> 01:10:11,400
Too big! Gives you an idea of
what the war did to my waistline.

729
01:10:11,525 --> 01:10:14,403
You holding your stomach in?
- No, it's disappeared.

730
01:10:14,528 --> 01:10:17,489
I'll have to take all my
old clothes to be altered.

731
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:19,867
I wouldn't be in too much of a hurry.

732
01:10:19,992 --> 01:10:23,787
A couple of weeks of heavy eating
and those pants will fit perfectly.

733
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:28,083
Don't answer it.

734
01:10:34,006 --> 01:10:35,299
Hello?

735
01:10:35,424 --> 01:10:37,593
Oh, yes.
He's here.

736
01:10:37,718 --> 01:10:40,345
For me?
If it's the War Department, I'm out.

737
01:10:40,471 --> 01:10:42,681
It's Mr Milton.
- Who?

738
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:45,142
Mr Milton at the bank.
- Oh.

739
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:49,855
He'll be right on.

740
01:10:52,357 --> 01:10:54,109
Hello?

741
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,904
Oh, yes,
Mr Milton.

742
01:10:58,155 --> 01:11:01,116
Yeah, it sounds good to hear yours.

743
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:04,703
Yes.

744
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:09,082
Yes, indeed,
Mr Milton. Yeah...

745
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,251
Well, not too bad, no.

746
01:11:13,253 --> 01:11:15,589
Yes.
Why, of course.

747
01:11:15,714 --> 01:11:17,883
It's very kind of you to say that.

748
01:11:18,008 --> 01:11:19,885
Mm- hm.

749
01:11:20,969 --> 01:11:22,346
Mm- hm.

750
01:11:22,471 --> 01:11:24,723
Yes.

751
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:28,143
Well, I'll...
I'll certainly drop in.

752
01:11:29,895 --> 01:11:33,148
Oh, she's fine,
thank you.

753
01:11:34,191 --> 01:11:37,236
Yes, they're fine too.

754
01:11:40,155 --> 01:11:41,573
Well...

755
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:43,117
I...

756
01:11:43,242 --> 01:11:45,536
That's...

757
01:11:45,661 --> 01:11:48,413
Thank you,
Mr Milton.

758
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:50,791
Yes, good...

759
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:52,751
Good...

760
01:11:53,836 --> 01:11:55,671
Good... goodbye.

761
01:11:57,047 --> 01:11:58,423
Mr Milton.

762
01:11:58,549 --> 01:12:03,512
He calls every day to see if you're home.
I guess they want you back at the bank.

763
01:12:04,096 --> 01:12:08,183
He wants me to drop in and talk about it.
- You're not going to work right away?

764
01:12:08,308 --> 01:12:10,936
You ought to rest awhile,
take a vacation.

765
01:12:11,061 --> 01:12:13,105
I've got to make money.

766
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:16,608
Last year it was kill Japs,
and this year it's make money.

767
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:19,736
We're all right for the time being.
- Mm.

768
01:12:19,862 --> 01:12:22,614
Why do they have to bother
me the first day I get home?

769
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:26,994
Why not give me time to get used to my
family? Come over here and sit down.

770
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:31,165
Chair's liable to break.
- We can't be worrying about chairs.

771
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:35,210
Not when they want me back in
a nice fat job in a nice fat bank!

772
01:12:35,335 --> 01:12:38,714
You don't seem very happy about it.
- I'm not.

773
01:12:38,839 --> 01:12:43,469
Why not, darling? - I keep
thinking about the other guys.

774
01:12:44,553 --> 01:12:47,556
All the ones who haven't got you.

775
01:12:47,681 --> 01:12:51,643
You're crazy.
- No, too sane for my own good.

776
01:13:15,876 --> 01:13:18,545
Yes, sir?
- Wasn't this Bullard's Drugstore?

777
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:21,215
Yes, but it was taken over
by the Midway chain.

778
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:25,302
Oh.
- But old Mr Bullard's still here.

779
01:13:25,427 --> 01:13:29,348
He's right over there by the phone.
- Thanks.

780
01:13:55,082 --> 01:13:57,251
Yes, sir?

781
01:13:57,376 --> 01:13:59,878
Oh, Fred!
- Hello, Mr Bullard.

782
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:03,632
It's good to see you again.
- lt's good to see you.

783
01:14:03,757 --> 01:14:06,677
Say, what happened here?
- Well, I sold out.

784
01:14:06,802 --> 01:14:09,513
Midway had been after this
location for a long time.

785
01:14:09,638 --> 01:14:12,724
Didn't he used to work here?
- Yes, he did.

786
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:14,935
I'll bet he's back looking for a job.

787
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:19,565
And he'll get it, too,
with all those ribbons on his chest.

788
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:25,362
Well, nobody's job is safe with all
these servicemen crowding in.

789
01:14:26,947 --> 01:14:30,325
Meet our new manager, Mr Thorpe.
- Oh, no, I don't think so.

790
01:14:30,451 --> 01:14:34,163
I just dropped in to say hello to you.
I don't want that old job back.

791
01:14:34,288 --> 01:14:38,167
Yes, I know.
But Midway's a big, big outfit.

792
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:40,961
You never can tell.
Come along.

793
01:14:43,338 --> 01:14:46,425
Thank you, Mr Bullard.
- I'll see you later.

794
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:50,471
I see you had a splendid war record.
- Just average, Mr Thorpe.

795
01:14:50,596 --> 01:14:56,185
Since this business changed hands, we're
not obliged to give you your old job back.

796
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:59,771
I wasn't thinking of my old job.
I'm looking for a better one.

797
01:14:59,897 --> 01:15:03,108
What are your qualifications?
Your experience?

798
01:15:03,233 --> 01:15:07,154
Two years behind a soda fountain,
three years behind a Norden bombsight.

799
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:11,408
Yeah. While in the army, did you
have any experience in procurement?

800
01:15:11,533 --> 01:15:13,827
No.
- Purchasing of supplies, materials?

801
01:15:13,952 --> 01:15:15,996
No, I just dropped bombs.

802
01:15:16,121 --> 01:15:18,165
Did you do any personnel work?
- No.

803
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:22,085
But as an officer you surely had
to act in an executive capacity,

804
01:15:22,211 --> 01:15:25,088
you had to command men,
be responsible for the morale?

805
01:15:25,214 --> 01:15:28,550
I was only responsible for
getting the bombs on the target.

806
01:15:28,675 --> 01:15:33,096
I didn't command anybody.
- I'm sure that required great skill.

807
01:15:33,222 --> 01:15:37,684
But, unfortunately, we've no
opportunities for that with Midway Drugs.

808
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:38,894
Yeah.

809
01:15:39,019 --> 01:15:44,024
We may be able to provide an opening as
assistant to Mr Merkel, the floor manager.

810
01:15:44,149 --> 01:15:46,401
"Sticky" Merkel?
- Clarence Merkel.

811
01:15:46,527 --> 01:15:49,947
That's the fella. He was my
assistant at the soda fountain.

812
01:15:50,072 --> 01:15:52,366
He's a very good man.

813
01:15:52,491 --> 01:15:57,746
Incidentally, your work would require
part- time duties at the soda fountain.

814
01:15:57,871 --> 01:16:00,249
At what salary?
- 32.50 per week.

815
01:16:00,374 --> 01:16:04,169
32.50! I used to make over
$400 a month in the air force.

816
01:16:04,294 --> 01:16:06,338
The war is over, Derry.

817
01:16:06,463 --> 01:16:10,008
I think I'll look around, Mr Thorpe.
Thank you, very much.

818
01:16:10,134 --> 01:16:12,177
And take care of that cold.

819
01:16:16,515 --> 01:16:20,185
I gotta run. I'll drop back later.
- All right, Fred. Bye.

820
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,354
Excuse me, girls.

821
01:17:07,858 --> 01:17:11,069
No, conditions are none
too good right now, Al.

822
01:17:11,195 --> 01:17:13,614
Considerable
uncertainty in business.

823
01:17:13,739 --> 01:17:16,492
Strikes.
Taxes still ruinous.

824
01:17:17,701 --> 01:17:21,038
You like that cigar?
- Yes, Mr Milton. It's fine.

825
01:17:21,163 --> 01:17:24,917
Hard to get those in the war, but they
come in regularly from Havana now.

826
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:28,879
Things will readjust
themselves in time.

827
01:17:29,004 --> 01:17:31,632
We want you back here with us, Al.

828
01:17:31,757 --> 01:17:38,055
That's very nice of you, Mr Milton,
but I noticed Steese sitting at my old desk.

829
01:17:39,139 --> 01:17:43,060
I wouldn't want to push him out.
- Steese'll stay right there.

830
01:17:43,185 --> 01:17:45,479
You're moving up.

831
01:17:46,355 --> 01:17:52,736
What do you say to being vice president in
charge of small loans, at $12,000 a year?

832
01:17:52,861 --> 01:17:55,239
What do you say to that, huh?

833
01:17:55,364 --> 01:17:58,200
I... I'd say it can't be true.

834
01:17:58,325 --> 01:18:00,369
Job's there, Al.

835
01:18:00,494 --> 01:18:04,164
You're the man for it. - What
makes you think I am, Mr Milton?

836
01:18:04,289 --> 01:18:08,127
Well, your war experience would
prove invaluable to us here.

837
01:18:08,252 --> 01:18:12,422
See, we have many new problems.
This Gl Bill of Rights, for instance.

838
01:18:12,548 --> 01:18:17,136
It involves us in consideration of all
kinds of loans to ex- servicemen.

839
01:18:17,261 --> 01:18:20,848
We need a man who understands
the soldiers' problems,

840
01:18:20,973 --> 01:18:27,187
and who's well grounded in the
fundamental principles of sound banking.

841
01:18:27,312 --> 01:18:29,690
In other words, you.

842
01:18:29,815 --> 01:18:31,942
Well?
What do you say, Al?

843
01:18:32,985 --> 01:18:36,238
Well, I'm...
I'm overwhelmed.

844
01:18:36,363 --> 01:18:38,407
Of course.
Of course.

845
01:18:39,533 --> 01:18:42,536
Will you bring them in now, please?
- Yes, sir.

846
01:18:42,661 --> 01:18:45,497
I'd thought of taking it easy...
- Naturally.

847
01:18:45,622 --> 01:18:49,710
After what you've been through,
you need a vacation. Thank you.

848
01:18:49,835 --> 01:18:53,172
You're entitled to enjoy life
before you come back to work.

849
01:18:53,297 --> 01:18:57,843
It's very kind of you to say that.
- When you get a chance...

850
01:18:57,968 --> 01:19:03,056
This contains reports with all the
figures on our Small Loans Department.

851
01:19:03,182 --> 01:19:06,101
Just in your spare time,
of course.

852
01:19:06,226 --> 01:19:09,646
Oh, the briefcase is a
slight gift from the bank.

853
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:13,192
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr Milton.

854
01:19:13,317 --> 01:19:17,654
Glad to have you back with us, Al.
- Thank you, sir.

855
01:19:20,115 --> 01:19:22,659
Sweetheart, I knew
you'd be heartbroken.

856
01:19:22,785 --> 01:19:28,248
But listen, you can get another
blonde. What about Sylvia Mack?

857
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:34,963
Oh, you're crazy.
I think her legs are cute.

858
01:19:36,131 --> 01:19:39,301
I'm sorry too, but he doesn't
want me to work nights.

859
01:19:39,426 --> 01:19:41,762
He says it's inconvenient.

860
01:19:44,473 --> 01:19:46,642
Oh, he's wonderful.
And how!

861
01:19:46,767 --> 01:19:50,187
Snappy uniform,
a whole ribbon counter on his chest.

862
01:19:50,312 --> 01:19:53,232
Sure, I'll bring him in sometime.

863
01:19:53,357 --> 01:19:57,110
Hey, the door bell's ringing.
I guess that's my Freddy.

864
01:19:57,236 --> 01:19:59,279
Bye.

865
01:20:02,533 --> 01:20:06,286
Hey, Marie, have you got an
extra key? I'd like to have it.

866
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:09,164
What are you looking at?
- Holy smoke, honey!

867
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:12,918
That's the first time I've ever
seen you in civilian clothes.

868
01:20:13,043 --> 01:20:16,922
Well, from now on, honey, you're
not gonna see me in anything else.

869
01:20:17,047 --> 01:20:21,009
I just got it out of the
mothballs over at Pop's house.

870
01:20:23,428 --> 01:20:25,764
I called up the Blue Devil.

871
01:20:25,889 --> 01:20:28,809
Who? - The nightclub.
I told 'em I'm through.

872
01:20:28,934 --> 01:20:31,520
Oh, swell.
- But let's go there for dinner.

873
01:20:31,645 --> 01:20:34,606
I'd like to introduce you.
They've heard all about you.

874
01:20:34,731 --> 01:20:39,361
Anything you say, honey. Here's
some perfume I bought in Paris.

875
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:41,697
Oh!
Fleurette No. 5!

876
01:20:41,822 --> 01:20:46,076
And this scarf's cute!
To think of having things from Paris!

877
01:20:46,201 --> 01:20:50,247
Freddy, honey, you're just a big hunk
of heaven. What's that a picture of?

878
01:20:50,372 --> 01:20:52,499
Bomb hits on D黶seldorf.

879
01:20:54,418 --> 01:20:56,545
That's my B- 17.

880
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:59,173
What are those?

881
01:20:59,298 --> 01:21:03,427
Little black flowers that
grow in the sky. - Huh?

882
01:21:03,552 --> 01:21:08,265
Hey, that's me! - I had it
pasted above my bombsight.

883
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:11,393
It took a lot of trips over Germany.
- That's sweet.

884
01:21:11,518 --> 01:21:16,523
The guys'd kid me about it. They'd take
a look at it and ask "Who's the dame?"

885
01:21:16,648 --> 01:21:20,777
When I told 'em it was my wife they'd
say "Nobody's got a wife looks like that."

886
01:21:20,903 --> 01:21:23,155
"What's her telephone number?"

887
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,491
When we go out will
you wear your uniform?

888
01:21:25,616 --> 01:21:27,117
Oh, no.
- For my sake.

889
01:21:27,242 --> 01:21:30,496
I'm sorry, baby.
- I'd be so proud to be out with you.

890
01:21:30,621 --> 01:21:32,664
Won't you, please?

891
01:21:34,124 --> 01:21:39,254
Well, seeing as it's you and seeing as I
can't find any place to hang it, all right.

892
01:21:39,379 --> 01:21:41,215
But it's the last time.

893
01:21:41,757 --> 01:21:45,969
If you don't like me in civilian clothes,
we'll just have to stay here all the time.

894
01:21:46,094 --> 01:21:48,555
Would that be so bad?

895
01:21:51,767 --> 01:21:55,562
You gotta get yourself some
new clothes. That suit's awful.

896
01:21:55,687 --> 01:22:01,360
I know, it's terrible. But they tell me
you can't buy anything new now.

897
01:22:01,485 --> 01:22:04,446
I know where you can get
snappy suits made to order.

898
01:22:04,571 --> 01:22:08,784
You mean there's a black market?
- lf you know the right people,

899
01:22:08,909 --> 01:22:11,578
and don't care how
much you spend...

900
01:22:11,703 --> 01:22:16,250
We're not worrying about that, baby.
I got money, cash money.

901
01:22:16,375 --> 01:22:20,295
Nearly 1 ,000 bucks,
from the good old US Treasury.

902
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:23,298
Oh, now you look wonderful!

903
01:22:23,423 --> 01:22:25,467
You look like yourself.

904
01:22:25,592 --> 01:22:28,262
It's so wonderful,
I can hardly believe it.

905
01:22:28,387 --> 01:22:31,890
Now we can have a real honeymoon,
without a care in the world.

906
01:22:32,015 --> 01:22:36,436
Just as if nothing had ever happened.
Just as if you'd never gone away.

907
01:22:36,562 --> 01:22:39,189
We're right back where we started.

908
01:22:39,314 --> 01:22:42,317
Don't say that, Marie.
- Don't say what?

909
01:22:42,442 --> 01:22:46,613
That we're right back where we started.
We never wanna be back there.

910
01:22:46,738 --> 01:22:49,158
But why not? What is it?
What's the matter?

911
01:22:49,283 --> 01:22:56,331
Oh, never mind. Skip it. I went back to the
drugstore today and I just got reminded.

912
01:22:57,958 --> 01:23:00,919
Come on,
let's go out and have fun.

913
01:23:28,697 --> 01:23:31,074
Hello, Wilma.
- Good afternoon, Mr Parrish.

914
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,702
Have you seen Homer?
- He's in the woodshed.

915
01:23:33,827 --> 01:23:37,790
He wants to practise shooting.

916
01:23:37,915 --> 01:23:40,751
So he can go hunting.

917
01:23:40,876 --> 01:23:43,962
You'd have thought he'd seen
enough shooting in the war.

918
01:23:44,087 --> 01:23:47,216
I guess he just wants to find
something to occupy himself.

919
01:23:47,341 --> 01:23:49,468
I guess so.

920
01:23:49,593 --> 01:23:52,137
I wish there was something
I knew to do for him.

921
01:23:52,262 --> 01:23:55,599
His mother and I have tried
to make him feel at home,

922
01:23:55,724 --> 01:23:59,561
but he just keeps to
himself all the time.

923
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:28,048
Hello, Luella.
What are you kids doing?

924
01:24:28,173 --> 01:24:30,717
Nothing.
We're just playing.

925
01:24:34,972 --> 01:24:38,559
That's his girl.
They're engaged.

926
01:24:43,689 --> 01:24:46,817
Oh. Hello, Wilma.
- Hello.

927
01:24:46,942 --> 01:24:50,863
Looking for something?
- No. Go right ahead.

928
01:25:20,225 --> 01:25:23,145
How'd you do, Homer?
- Only fair.

929
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:26,899
Well, you did fine.

930
01:25:27,024 --> 01:25:29,067
I'll do better.

931
01:25:39,411 --> 01:25:41,705
I've been wanting to talk to you.

932
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:46,710
What about?
- About everything. About us.

933
01:25:47,711 --> 01:25:51,632
What about us?
We're all right, aren't we?

934
01:25:51,757 --> 01:25:55,010
No.
Listen to me, Homer.

935
01:25:55,135 --> 01:25:57,179
I'm listening.

936
01:25:58,514 --> 01:26:02,851
You wrote me that when you got home
you and I were going to be married.

937
01:26:02,976 --> 01:26:07,231
If you wrote that once, you wrote
it 100 times. Isn't that true?

938
01:26:07,356 --> 01:26:10,317
Yes, but things are different now.

939
01:26:12,236 --> 01:26:14,238
Have you changed your mind?

940
01:26:14,363 --> 01:26:17,407
Have I said anything
about changing my mind?

941
01:26:17,533 --> 01:26:19,409
No.

942
01:26:19,535 --> 01:26:24,581
That's just it. You haven't
said anything about anything.

943
01:26:29,419 --> 01:26:32,172
That's not loaded, is it?
- Of course it isn't.

944
01:26:32,297 --> 01:26:34,716
Don't you think I know
how to handle a gun?

945
01:26:34,842 --> 01:26:36,885
I don't know what to think, Homer.

946
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:42,307
All I know is, I was in love with you when
you left and I'm in love with you now.

947
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:46,562
Other things may have changed,
but that hasn't.

948
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:59,241
You wanna see how the hooks work?

949
01:26:59,366 --> 01:27:01,535
You wanna see the freak?

950
01:27:04,037 --> 01:27:06,623
All right,
I'll show you!

951
01:27:07,124 --> 01:27:09,918
Take a good look!

952
01:27:10,043 --> 01:27:12,880
I didn't mean anything, Homer.

953
01:27:14,131 --> 01:27:16,675
I was only...

954
01:27:19,511 --> 01:27:22,055
I'm... I'm sorry, Luella.

955
01:27:22,181 --> 01:27:24,766
It isn't your fault.

956
01:27:24,892 --> 01:27:27,644
Go on and play with your friends.

957
01:27:40,699 --> 01:27:43,202
I know, Wilma.
I was wrong.

958
01:27:43,327 --> 01:27:45,746
I shouldn't have acted like that.

959
01:27:45,871 --> 01:27:49,458
It wasn't her that...
burned my hands off.

960
01:27:52,044 --> 01:27:55,380
I'll be all right.
I just gotta work it out myself.

961
01:27:55,506 --> 01:28:00,719
I could help you, Homer, if you'd let
me. - I've gotta work it out myself.

962
01:28:00,844 --> 01:28:04,431
All I've wanted is for people
to treat me like anybody else,

963
01:28:04,556 --> 01:28:06,600
instead of pitying me.

964
01:28:07,684 --> 01:28:10,729
I guess it's hard for them to do that.

965
01:28:10,854 --> 01:28:15,442
I've just gotta learn to get used
to it and pay no attention.

966
01:28:16,527 --> 01:28:20,322
Couldn't I...?
- No! I've gotta do it myself.

967
01:29:38,358 --> 01:29:41,278
Yes?
- OK, Pop, I'm going to bed now.

968
01:29:41,403 --> 01:29:43,530
Be right with you, Homer.

969
01:31:01,859 --> 01:31:04,278
Night, son.
- Good night, Pop.

970
01:31:04,403 --> 01:31:06,447
Thanks.

971
01:31:27,759 --> 01:31:30,012
Hello, babe.
- What you got there?

972
01:31:30,137 --> 01:31:34,016
Our supper. Cream of corn soup,
potato salad, salami and liverwurst.

973
01:31:34,141 --> 01:31:37,144
We're going to Jackie's Hot Spot.
I made a reservation.

974
01:31:37,269 --> 01:31:40,814
We're eating at home.
- Are you sick or something?

975
01:31:40,939 --> 01:31:42,983
No, dear.
Broke.

976
01:31:44,735 --> 01:31:46,779
Broke?
- You got it.

977
01:31:46,904 --> 01:31:49,615
Well, what happened?
Where did it go to?

978
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:52,242
We spent it, babe.
That's what happened.

979
01:31:53,285 --> 01:31:55,662
I didn't tell you the
money was almost gone

980
01:31:55,788 --> 01:31:59,249
because I kept hoping I
was gonna land a good job.

981
01:31:59,374 --> 01:32:02,377
But I'm not going to get one,

982
01:32:02,503 --> 01:32:08,008
so we'll have to forget about Jackie's Hot
Spot and the Blue Devil and all the rest.

983
01:32:08,133 --> 01:32:10,385
Why couldn't you get a job?
Have you tried?

984
01:32:10,511 --> 01:32:14,848
Sure. I've been all over town - all the
employment offices and the USES.

985
01:32:14,973 --> 01:32:18,519
They say I ought to spend a
couple of years as an apprentice,

986
01:32:18,644 --> 01:32:21,605
or go to a trade school.

987
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:24,733
A couple of years,
with you going to kindergarten.

988
01:32:24,858 --> 01:32:27,319
And what would I be
doing in the meantime?

989
01:32:27,444 --> 01:32:30,823
You can always help
me with my homework.

990
01:32:34,409 --> 01:32:36,578
Fred.
- Yeah?

991
01:32:36,703 --> 01:32:40,290
Are you really all right?
- Of course I'm all right. Why?

992
01:32:40,415 --> 01:32:43,335
I mean, in your mind.
Is anything...?

993
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:47,256
My mind?!
You mean you think I'm going goofy?

994
01:32:49,383 --> 01:32:51,426
I've been wondering.

995
01:32:51,552 --> 01:32:54,346
What was Gadowsky?

996
01:32:54,471 --> 01:32:57,599
Where did you hear about him?
- You talk in your sleep.

997
01:32:57,724 --> 01:33:01,270
Something's on fire and you
want somebody to get out.

998
01:33:01,395 --> 01:33:03,772
You keep saying "Gadowsky!
Gadowsky!"

999
01:33:03,897 --> 01:33:05,858
Gadorsky.

1000
01:33:05,983 --> 01:33:09,319
He was a friend of mine,
a B- 17 pilot. He got it over Berlin.

1001
01:33:09,445 --> 01:33:12,364
Can't you get it out of your system?
- Oh, sure

1002
01:33:12,489 --> 01:33:17,077
The war's over. You won't get anyplace
till you stop thinking about it.

1003
01:33:17,202 --> 01:33:21,623
Come on, snap out of it!
- OK, honey, I'll do that

1004
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:27,254
I didn't tell you, Fred,
but I got a little money saved.

1005
01:33:27,379 --> 01:33:29,423
Dinner's on me tonight.

1006
01:33:30,591 --> 01:33:34,136
You'd better keep on saving it.
It might come in handy sometime.

1007
01:33:34,261 --> 01:33:36,805
I appreciate the offer,
but we're eating at home.

1008
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:40,142
Well, I'm hungry.
I'm going out by myself.

1009
01:33:40,267 --> 01:33:44,104
You're not going.
You'll eat what I cook. - Let go of me!

1010
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:49,193
When we married, the justice of the peace
said "For better, for worse". Remember?

1011
01:33:49,318 --> 01:33:51,737
This is the "worse".
- When do we get the "better"?

1012
01:33:51,862 --> 01:33:54,031
When I get wise to myself,
I guess.

1013
01:33:54,156 --> 01:33:57,326
When I realise I'm not an officer
and a gentleman any more,

1014
01:33:57,451 --> 01:33:59,912
I'm just another soda
jerk out of a job.

1015
01:34:00,037 --> 01:34:05,959
Go and sit down and read a magazine or
listen to the radio while I cook the soup.

1016
01:34:07,836 --> 01:34:10,589
I'll fix you a nice meal, honey.

1017
01:34:10,714 --> 01:34:15,010
Just like I used to do behind
the fountain, before the war.

1018
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:32,736
Perfume and Cosmetics is
our outstanding feature.

1019
01:34:32,861 --> 01:34:36,824
It accounts for 34? of gross intake and
an even higher proportion of profits.

1020
01:34:36,949 --> 01:34:40,661
As you will surmise, our customers
in this department are women.

1021
01:34:40,786 --> 01:34:43,205
Yes, I'd surmised that.

1022
01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:48,460
You must familiarise yourself with the
correct pronunciation of all the perfumes.

1023
01:34:48,585 --> 01:34:51,380
R陃e Romantique.
- That means Romantic Dream.

1024
01:34:51,505 --> 01:34:55,717
You speak French? - Sticky,
just enough to go to Paris bars.

1025
01:34:55,843 --> 01:35:00,139
Let's get one thing straight, Derry.
The name "Sticky" is out.

1026
01:35:00,264 --> 01:35:02,641
Yes, Mr Merkel.
I understand.

1027
01:35:02,766 --> 01:35:07,312
This week we're pushing the new
Champagne Bubble Bath. $1 .98.

1028
01:35:07,437 --> 01:35:10,524
Down here are some special...
Come here.

1029
01:35:10,649 --> 01:35:14,486
Down here are some specially
made- up toilet sets...

1030
01:35:18,282 --> 01:35:21,452
Thank you.
- Morning, Mr Latham.

1031
01:35:21,577 --> 01:35:25,164
Morning.
- Good morning, Mr Stephenson.

1032
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:29,668
What have we here?
The Bretton Woods Agreement?

1033
01:35:29,793 --> 01:35:34,590
That's a Mr Novak, waiting over
there. He's applying for a Gl loan.

1034
01:35:34,715 --> 01:35:38,010
Oh, good. I'll see him.
- Mr Novak.

1035
01:35:38,135 --> 01:35:41,305
Sit down, Mr Novak.
- Thank you, sir.

1036
01:35:42,264 --> 01:35:44,391
Don't "sir" me,
Mr Novak.

1037
01:35:45,434 --> 01:35:47,478
I'm a sergeant.

1038
01:35:51,273 --> 01:35:53,400
I see you were in the navy.
- Yes, sir.

1039
01:35:53,525 --> 01:35:56,570
I mean, yes, I was.
In the Seabees.

1040
01:35:56,695 --> 01:35:58,739
Where'd you operate?

1041
01:35:58,864 --> 01:36:01,617
All over the Pacific.
One island after another.

1042
01:36:01,742 --> 01:36:03,994
What'd you do, mostly?

1043
01:36:04,119 --> 01:36:08,540
Go in before the landings and clear the
mines and underwater obstructions.

1044
01:36:08,665 --> 01:36:11,835
When they'd taken enough ground
for an airstrip we'd build it.

1045
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:15,464
Fairly interesting work, eh?
- No, it got monotonous.

1046
01:36:15,589 --> 01:36:20,177
Those islands all look alike.
Until Iwo Jima. That was different.

1047
01:36:20,302 --> 01:36:23,055
So I've heard.

1048
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:26,433
I see you have quite a family.
A wife and four children.

1049
01:36:26,558 --> 01:36:30,896
Yes. There'd have been more if
I hadn't been away three years.

1050
01:36:31,021 --> 01:36:34,108
And now you wanna buy a farm.
- Yes, sir.

1051
01:36:34,233 --> 01:36:36,652
Got my eye on a fine
piece of property.

1052
01:36:36,777 --> 01:36:39,238
40 acres,
out near Anton Corners.

1053
01:36:39,363 --> 01:36:41,406
What about collateral?

1054
01:36:42,658 --> 01:36:46,662
Collateral? What's that?
- Security for your loan.

1055
01:36:46,787 --> 01:36:49,081
What can you put up
in the way of property?

1056
01:36:49,206 --> 01:36:54,294
Have you any stocks and bonds?
Real estate? Valuables of any kind?

1057
01:36:54,419 --> 01:36:58,590
No, Mr Stephenson. You see, the
point is, I haven't got any property.

1058
01:36:58,715 --> 01:37:02,261
That's why I want the loan,
so I can get the property.

1059
01:37:02,386 --> 01:37:04,638
I see.

1060
01:37:04,763 --> 01:37:07,766
No collateral.
That makes things difficult.

1061
01:37:07,891 --> 01:37:10,102
I'm a good farmer,
Mr Stephenson.

1062
01:37:10,227 --> 01:37:12,729
Why, even during the
war I kept my hand in.

1063
01:37:12,855 --> 01:37:16,859
I used to spend my spare time down
on those islands working truck gardens

1064
01:37:16,984 --> 01:37:21,071
so my outfit could have fresh
tomatoes and green corn and all that.

1065
01:37:21,196 --> 01:37:25,993
And before the war I was a sharecropper,
like my father before me.

1066
01:37:26,118 --> 01:37:30,831
And now, I feel I'd like to have a
little piece of my own to work.

1067
01:37:30,956 --> 01:37:34,084
You like to grow things, eh?
- Yes, sir.

1068
01:37:34,209 --> 01:37:36,712
And with the food shortage
all over the world,

1069
01:37:36,837 --> 01:37:39,965
farming's about the most
important work there is.

1070
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:44,428
I mean... Well, don't you think so,
Mr Stephenson?

1071
01:37:45,762 --> 01:37:47,806
Yes.

1072
01:37:48,724 --> 01:37:54,271
You see, Mr Stephenson, I don't feel
this is asking the bank for a handout.

1073
01:37:54,396 --> 01:37:59,443
I feel it's my right. At least, that's what
I've been told by other ex- servicemen:

1074
01:37:59,568 --> 01:38:02,070
that the government
guarantees loans to us...

1075
01:38:02,196 --> 01:38:05,908
Your loan would be
administered through this bank,

1076
01:38:06,033 --> 01:38:09,953
which would put up half
of the $6,000 you require.

1077
01:38:10,078 --> 01:38:14,208
Now, that involves risk for this bank,
Mr Novak.

1078
01:38:19,588 --> 01:38:21,632
Excuse me.

1079
01:38:32,684 --> 01:38:34,061
Al!
- Homer!

1080
01:38:34,186 --> 01:38:37,022
Look at you!
- Look at you!

1081
01:38:37,147 --> 01:38:40,901
So this is where you work. - Sort of.
Are you sticking up the bank?

1082
01:38:41,026 --> 01:38:45,989
Look, 200 leaves of cabbage. That's
what I get every month from now on.

1083
01:38:46,115 --> 01:38:48,283
Pretty soft, eh?
- Pretty soft.

1084
01:38:48,408 --> 01:38:53,789
You sure we haven't short- changed you?
- I kept my eye on the guy counting it out.

1085
01:38:53,914 --> 01:38:56,875
Did you know Fred Derry had a
job at the Midway Drugstore?

1086
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,586
No, I didn't.
- He introduced me to his wife.

1087
01:38:59,711 --> 01:39:01,964
Yeah?
- Some dish.

1088
01:39:02,089 --> 01:39:05,008
We'll all have to get
together at Butch's.

1089
01:39:05,134 --> 01:39:07,553
Fine. That's where I'm going now.
- Yeah?

1090
01:39:07,678 --> 01:39:11,056
To take a piano lesson.
- You... Uh- huh?

1091
01:39:11,181 --> 01:39:13,475
Take one for me.

1092
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,353
See you later.
- So long, Homer.

1093
01:39:24,236 --> 01:39:29,533
Well, as I was saying, Mr Novak,
there is an element of risk involved.

1094
01:39:29,658 --> 01:39:35,330
We'll have to have the property
appraised. But you'll get your loan.

1095
01:39:35,456 --> 01:39:39,251
Say, Mr Stephenson, I don't
know how to begin to thank you.

1096
01:39:39,376 --> 01:39:42,129
Don't try.
You look like a good risk to me.

1097
01:39:42,254 --> 01:39:45,591
When the tomato plants start
producing, I want free samples.

1098
01:39:45,716 --> 01:39:51,472
I'll tell you when the papers are
ready. - Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1099
01:39:51,597 --> 01:39:53,640
God bless you.

1100
01:40:00,647 --> 01:40:02,858
I've seen advertisements about this.

1101
01:40:02,983 --> 01:40:05,778
Night of Bliss.
Is it all that they say it is?

1102
01:40:05,903 --> 01:40:09,198
What do they say it is?
"Haunting, provocative, languorous."

1103
01:40:09,323 --> 01:40:11,408
Oh, yes,
I'm sure it's all of those.

1104
01:40:16,789 --> 01:40:18,832
Dexter!

1105
01:40:23,128 --> 01:40:25,923
Don't play with those toys, bud.
- My name ain't Bud!

1106
01:40:26,048 --> 01:40:29,218
Dexter, stop that.
- I just wanted to see how it worked.

1107
01:40:29,343 --> 01:40:32,638
Sorry.
You heard what Mommy said.

1108
01:40:32,763 --> 01:40:35,140
Ooh, Seduction.
How much is that?

1109
01:40:35,265 --> 01:40:40,938
This is... It's quite expensive.
It's 16.50. But it's a nice size.

1110
01:40:48,112 --> 01:40:50,155
You see what I mean?

1111
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:53,992
But it's a good, safe bet.
- Just what do you mean by that?

1112
01:40:54,118 --> 01:40:57,412
Well, I mean it's...
it's a perfume that fits any mood.

1113
01:40:57,538 --> 01:40:59,373
Oh!

1114
01:40:59,498 --> 01:41:03,502
All right, I'll take it.
- Very good, madam.

1115
01:41:03,627 --> 01:41:06,797
Mommy! Mommy, look!
Bang, bang, bang, bang!

1116
01:41:06,922 --> 01:41:10,217
I shot it down!
I shot it down in flames!

1117
01:41:17,474 --> 01:41:20,018
I'm very sorry... Oh, hello.

1118
01:41:20,144 --> 01:41:22,187
Hello.

1119
01:41:23,272 --> 01:41:27,443
Thank you very much. I'll be with
you in just a moment, madam.

1120
01:41:27,568 --> 01:41:29,653
Will you take this, please?

1121
01:41:29,778 --> 01:41:32,239
This lady will have your
package in a moment.

1122
01:41:32,364 --> 01:41:36,326
Thank you very much.
Come in again. - Thank you.

1123
01:41:36,994 --> 01:41:39,705
You were wonderful.
- I wanted to smack him.

1124
01:41:39,830 --> 01:41:42,666
It's against the rules to chat,
unless it's a sale.

1125
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:45,169
Oh. All right,
I'll buy something.

1126
01:41:45,294 --> 01:41:49,214
What's this? - Youth Recaptured,
a complexion cream.

1127
01:41:49,339 --> 01:41:52,342
But you don't need any
of that phoney stuff.

1128
01:41:52,468 --> 01:41:55,846
That's vanishing cream.
This is a vanishing- cream remover.

1129
01:41:55,971 --> 01:42:02,603
I'll tell you how you can save money.
If you don't put that on, you don't need this.

1130
01:42:02,728 --> 01:42:06,774
How about some lotion?
Here's one at $2.98.

1131
01:42:06,899 --> 01:42:10,277
And you'd be overcharged
at half the price.

1132
01:42:10,402 --> 01:42:12,613
I didn't really come
in to buy anything.

1133
01:42:12,738 --> 01:42:16,283
Dad told me you were working here.
I just dropped in to say hello.

1134
01:42:16,408 --> 01:42:18,827
Just a minute.
I have...

1135
01:42:20,579 --> 01:42:25,167
I have an hour off at one o'clock.
Are you doing anything for lunch?

1136
01:42:25,292 --> 01:42:28,086
Why, no.
- Thank you, madam.

1137
01:42:28,212 --> 01:42:31,465
I'll meet you outside in 20 minutes.
Come in again.

1138
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:33,175
Thank you.

1139
01:42:48,732 --> 01:42:51,485
The apple pie, she's homemade.
- Good.

1140
01:42:51,610 --> 01:42:53,654
Thank you.

1141
01:42:54,696 --> 01:42:58,659
It is a nice little place.
I never heard of it before.

1142
01:42:58,784 --> 01:43:02,913
I used to come here now and then
in the old days, before the war.

1143
01:43:03,038 --> 01:43:05,999
I used to think of this place
when I was overseas.

1144
01:43:06,125 --> 01:43:11,421
I thought "When I get back home I'm
never gonna eat in a dump like Lucia's."

1145
01:43:11,547 --> 01:43:13,882
What else did you
think you wouldn't do?

1146
01:43:14,007 --> 01:43:17,553
I never had any clear ideas, but
there were two things I was sure of.

1147
01:43:17,678 --> 01:43:21,557
One, that I knew I'd never
go back to that drugstore.

1148
01:43:21,682 --> 01:43:23,809
What was the other thing?

1149
01:43:23,934 --> 01:43:26,520
That was even sillier.

1150
01:43:26,645 --> 01:43:29,022
I dreamed I was gonna
have my own home.

1151
01:43:29,148 --> 01:43:32,860
Just a nice little house for my
wife and me out in the country...

1152
01:43:32,985 --> 01:43:35,320
In the suburbs, anyway.

1153
01:43:35,446 --> 01:43:38,949
That's the cockeyed kind of dream
you have when you're overseas.

1154
01:43:39,074 --> 01:43:42,703
You don't have to be overseas
to have dreams like that.

1155
01:43:42,828 --> 01:43:46,957
Yeah. You can get crazy
ideas right here at home.

1156
01:43:51,211 --> 01:43:54,339
You have to be back at work at two?
- Yeah.

1157
01:43:54,882 --> 01:43:56,967
Well, hadn't you better...?

1158
01:43:58,427 --> 01:44:04,099
Yeah. Check, please. - 85c apiece
for lunch, plus tax, is $1 .76.

1159
01:44:04,224 --> 01:44:06,268
OK.

1160
01:44:06,393 --> 01:44:09,563
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
- Bye.

1161
01:44:10,731 --> 01:44:14,318
Goodbye, signorina. Come again.
- We'll do that. So long.

1162
01:44:14,443 --> 01:44:15,694
Arrivederci.

1163
01:44:25,537 --> 01:44:27,581
Well...

1164
01:44:43,263 --> 01:44:45,474
That shouldn't have happened.

1165
01:44:46,558 --> 01:44:48,602
But I guess it had to.

1166
01:44:56,318 --> 01:44:58,862
Goodbye, Peggy.
- Goodbye.

1167
01:45:13,418 --> 01:45:17,798
We were discussing this loan to
this man... What's his name?

1168
01:45:17,923 --> 01:45:19,925
Novak.

1169
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:22,469
Yes.
Yes, I approved it.

1170
01:45:22,594 --> 01:45:25,347
May I ask, Al,
on what basis?

1171
01:45:25,472 --> 01:45:29,184
On the basis of my own judgment.
Novak looked to me like a good bet.

1172
01:45:29,309 --> 01:45:31,770
But the man has no collateral,
no security.

1173
01:45:31,895 --> 01:45:35,607
Evidently, you saw something
in him. - Yes, Mr Milton.

1174
01:45:35,732 --> 01:45:38,152
What was it?
- Security.

1175
01:45:38,277 --> 01:45:40,904
Collateral.

1176
01:45:41,029 --> 01:45:45,200
In the army I was with men stripped
of everything in the way of property

1177
01:45:45,325 --> 01:45:49,037
except what they carried around
with them and inside them.

1178
01:45:49,163 --> 01:45:52,624
I saw them being tested. Some of
them stood up to it, some didn't.

1179
01:45:52,749 --> 01:45:55,419
But you could tell which
ones you could count on.

1180
01:45:55,544 --> 01:45:58,547
I tell you,
this man Novak is OK.

1181
01:45:58,672 --> 01:46:04,970
His "collateral" is in his hands, in his heart,
in his guts. In his right as a citizen.

1182
01:46:05,095 --> 01:46:08,849
Nobody's denying him his rights.
- We are. If we deny him his chance...

1183
01:46:08,974 --> 01:46:11,852
Gentlemen, there's no
need to raise our voices.

1184
01:46:11,977 --> 01:46:16,732
Of course, since you've approved
the loan, the incident is closed.

1185
01:46:16,857 --> 01:46:21,320
However, in the future, Al...
- Yes, I understand, Mr Milton.

1186
01:46:21,445 --> 01:46:24,823
In the future I must
exercise more caution.

1187
01:46:24,948 --> 01:46:26,992
Thank you,
Mr Prew.

1188
01:46:29,036 --> 01:46:31,079
Al, uh...

1189
01:46:33,624 --> 01:46:37,169
Al, you know how I feel
about you and always have.

1190
01:46:37,294 --> 01:46:41,924
Why, I've always considered you
one of the family, so to speak.

1191
01:46:42,049 --> 01:46:44,802
Like my own s...
younger brother.

1192
01:46:45,886 --> 01:46:49,807
I picked you personally for this job,
and I know you'll make good.

1193
01:46:49,932 --> 01:46:58,148
We do have a desire to extend a helping
hand to returning veterans when possible.

1194
01:46:58,273 --> 01:47:02,402
But we must all remember that this
is not our money we're doling out.

1195
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:07,407
It belongs to our depositors,
and we can't gamble with it.

1196
01:47:07,533 --> 01:47:09,827
I'll remember,
Mr Milton.

1197
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:12,329
We'll meet at the Union Club at 7.30.

1198
01:47:12,454 --> 01:47:17,835
And give my best to your charming
wife. - Thank you, Mr Milton.

1199
01:47:42,985 --> 01:47:45,028
Hello.
- Oh, hello.

1200
01:47:46,071 --> 01:47:48,740
Hurry and get dressed.
And wear your new suit.

1201
01:47:48,866 --> 01:47:51,285
We're going to dinner
at the Embassy Club.

1202
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:54,204
Don't worry, it won't cost a nickel.
We got invited.

1203
01:47:54,329 --> 01:47:56,999
Who invited us?
- Miss Peggy Stephenson.

1204
01:47:57,124 --> 01:48:02,004
She called up, said her father was a friend
of yours. She sounded like a nice kid.

1205
01:48:02,129 --> 01:48:06,758
She's going out with some boyfriend and
asked us on a double date, as guests.

1206
01:48:06,884 --> 01:48:10,012
You told her we could go?
- You bet I did.

1207
01:48:10,137 --> 01:48:16,518
Well, call her up and tell her we can't go.
Tell her I made another engagement.

1208
01:48:18,353 --> 01:48:21,899
Say, who is this Peggy Stephenson?
- She's a girl.

1209
01:48:22,024 --> 01:48:24,902
I didn't think she was a kangaroo.
Where'd you meet her?

1210
01:48:25,027 --> 01:48:28,864
The night I got back, Al Stephenson
and his wife took me home.

1211
01:48:28,989 --> 01:48:31,700
She's their daughter.
I'd never seen her before.

1212
01:48:31,825 --> 01:48:33,702
Or since?

1213
01:48:33,827 --> 01:48:37,206
If you wanna make anything out
of this, you'll be disappointed.

1214
01:48:37,331 --> 01:48:39,750
I just don't like accepting handouts.

1215
01:48:39,875 --> 01:48:46,089
You'd better get used to it, cos we won't
get much fun on your 32.50 a week!

1216
01:49:01,772 --> 01:49:03,816
Hold still!

1217
01:49:05,109 --> 01:49:07,486
You'll probably have
to make a speech.

1218
01:49:07,611 --> 01:49:12,658
It's my plan to meet that situation
by getting well plastered.

1219
01:49:13,742 --> 01:49:16,745
Peggy's going out with
Woody Merrill. - Who's he?

1220
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:19,331
You know, Bill Merrill's son.
- Oh, yeah.

1221
01:49:19,456 --> 01:49:22,376
Fine people, the Merrills.
Strictly TCR.

1222
01:49:22,501 --> 01:49:25,504
What's that?
- Top credit rating.

1223
01:49:25,629 --> 01:49:28,465
Are his intentions honourable?
- I doubt it.

1224
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:31,927
But they're going to be chaperoned
by Fred Derry and his wife.

1225
01:49:32,052 --> 01:49:34,638
Fred Derry? Ha!
Some chaperone!

1226
01:49:35,722 --> 01:49:38,517
I think she's crazy about him.
- Who, Merrill?

1227
01:49:38,642 --> 01:49:40,978
No, Fred.

1228
01:49:41,103 --> 01:49:44,189
Have you got evidence to
support that amazing statement?

1229
01:49:44,314 --> 01:49:46,525
Just a hunch.
- Oh.

1230
01:49:49,194 --> 01:49:51,864
But my hunches are pretty good.

1231
01:50:02,249 --> 01:50:04,751
Ah! Cocktails!
- No, you don't.

1232
01:50:04,877 --> 01:50:07,254
I made this for Woody Merrill.

1233
01:50:07,379 --> 01:50:11,258
Surely you wouldn't deny your father
a drop on a cold night like this.

1234
01:50:11,383 --> 01:50:15,554
I would if I could.
- I hear you're gonna see Fred, hm?

1235
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:18,891
Yes.
- What's his wife like?

1236
01:50:19,016 --> 01:50:21,477
I don't know.
I'll tell you later.

1237
01:50:21,602 --> 01:50:24,313
They'll have cocktails
at the Union Club.

1238
01:50:24,438 --> 01:50:28,317
I know the kind Mrs Milton serves:
pink, sweet and nauseating.

1239
01:50:28,442 --> 01:50:31,737
I was just asking Peggy
about Fred's wife.

1240
01:50:31,862 --> 01:50:35,324
Never mind, Mom.
I know what you're both thinking.

1241
01:50:36,033 --> 01:50:38,660
What are we thinking?

1242
01:50:38,786 --> 01:50:41,789
You're afraid I may
be in love with Fred.

1243
01:50:41,914 --> 01:50:45,542
Why, I never had any such idea!
- Shut up, Al.

1244
01:50:45,667 --> 01:50:48,253
Are you in love with him?

1245
01:50:49,505 --> 01:50:51,381
Yes.

1246
01:50:51,507 --> 01:50:53,759
But I don't want to be.

1247
01:50:53,884 --> 01:50:58,263
That's why I asked him and his
wife to go out with us this evening.

1248
01:50:58,388 --> 01:51:02,643
I think it ought to have a
very healthy effect on me.

1249
01:51:02,768 --> 01:51:05,020
Once I get to know her, I...

1250
01:51:06,063 --> 01:51:08,982
I'm sure I'll stop being silly
about the whole thing.

1251
01:51:14,446 --> 01:51:18,158
We don't need to worry about that
child. She can take care of herself.

1252
01:51:18,283 --> 01:51:20,327
That's what she thinks.

1253
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:23,705
Good evening.
- Good evening.

1254
01:51:23,831 --> 01:51:25,541
You know my father.
- Mr Stephenson.

1255
01:51:25,666 --> 01:51:28,752
Nice to see you again. Have a drink?
- Thank you.

1256
01:51:28,877 --> 01:51:31,088
I've played golf with your father.

1257
01:51:31,213 --> 01:51:34,424
Been to the club since you got back?
- I haven't had a chance.

1258
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:36,135
Al, we'll be late.
- Right.

1259
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:38,095
Good night.
- Night.

1260
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:40,806
Have a good time, children.
- Thank you.

1261
01:51:40,931 --> 01:51:43,225
Give my best to Fred.

1262
01:51:44,643 --> 01:51:46,645
Al, come on!

1263
01:51:47,729 --> 01:51:49,773
Yes, Mr Milton!

1264
01:51:57,906 --> 01:52:01,452
Hello, Peggy.
- Oh, Woody, don't be a bore.

1265
01:52:02,494 --> 01:52:04,455
We'll be late.

1266
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:07,875
Our country must stand today
where it has always stood,

1267
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,336
the citadel of individual initiative,

1268
01:52:11,462 --> 01:52:15,174
the land of unlimited
opportunity for all.

1269
01:52:20,429 --> 01:52:22,639
It is peculiarly appropriate

1270
01:52:22,764 --> 01:52:27,936
that we meet here tonight to honour one
who has valiantly fought for that freedom.

1271
01:52:28,061 --> 01:52:33,609
Ladies and gentlemen, we greet
our friend, our co- worker, our hero,

1272
01:52:33,734 --> 01:52:35,360
Al Stephenson.

1273
01:52:35,486 --> 01:52:37,738
Come on, on your feet,
Al. On your feet.

1274
01:52:45,204 --> 01:52:49,208
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm very happy to be here.

1275
01:52:49,333 --> 01:52:51,877
In fact,
I'm very happy to be anywhere.

1276
01:52:52,002 --> 01:52:54,046
In fact,
I'm very happy!

1277
01:52:56,590 --> 01:53:00,719
Perhaps it'd be a good idea if you
just put that bottle down right here.

1278
01:53:00,844 --> 01:53:05,432
Save yourself quite a number of
trips. - Good old Al!

1279
01:53:10,395 --> 01:53:14,441
I'm glad to see you've all
pulled through so well.

1280
01:53:14,566 --> 01:53:18,278
As Mr Milton so
perfectly expressed it,

1281
01:53:18,403 --> 01:53:24,618
our country stands today... where
it stands today. Wherever that is.

1282
01:53:24,743 --> 01:53:29,832
I'm sure you'd all agree with me if I said
that now's the time to stop this nonsense,

1283
01:53:29,957 --> 01:53:35,504
face facts, get down to brass tacks,
forget about the war, and go fishing.

1284
01:53:35,629 --> 01:53:37,965
But I'm not gonna say it.

1285
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:41,802
I'm just going to sum the
whole thing up in one word.

1286
01:53:45,097 --> 01:53:49,560
My wife doesn't think I'd better
sum it up in that one word.

1287
01:53:50,644 --> 01:53:53,522
The reason for my
success as a sergeant

1288
01:53:53,647 --> 01:53:58,694
is due primarily to my previous training
in the Cornbelt Loan and Trust Company.

1289
01:53:59,528 --> 01:54:01,989
The knowledge I acquired
in the good old bank

1290
01:54:02,114 --> 01:54:05,784
I applied to my
problems in the infantry.

1291
01:54:05,909 --> 01:54:09,705
For instance, one day in Okinawa,
a major says "You see that hill?"

1292
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:12,833
I said "Yes, sir. I see it."
"All right," he said.

1293
01:54:12,958 --> 01:54:16,336
"You and your platoon will
attack said hill and take it."

1294
01:54:16,462 --> 01:54:21,467
So I said "But that operation
involves considerable risk."

1295
01:54:21,592 --> 01:54:24,094
"We haven't sufficient collateral."

1296
01:54:24,219 --> 01:54:30,142
"I'm aware of that", said the major, "but
you are the guys who are going to take it."

1297
01:54:30,267 --> 01:54:35,230
So I said to him "I'm sorry, Major.
No collateral, no hill."

1298
01:54:36,315 --> 01:54:40,694
So we didn't take the hill,
and we lost the war.

1299
01:54:43,989 --> 01:54:49,036
Uh, I think that little story
has considerable significance.

1300
01:54:49,161 --> 01:54:52,456
But I've...
I've forgotten what it is.

1301
01:54:55,417 --> 01:54:56,210
Uh...

1302
01:54:56,335 --> 01:55:00,088
And now, in conclusion, I'd like
to tell you a humorous anecdote.

1303
01:55:00,214 --> 01:55:05,260
I know several humorous anecdotes,
but I can't think of any way to clean 'em up!

1304
01:55:05,385 --> 01:55:09,223
So I'll only say this much.

1305
01:55:09,348 --> 01:55:12,267
I love the Cornbelt Loan
and Trust Company.

1306
01:55:13,352 --> 01:55:19,525
Some say that the bank is suffering from
hardening of the arteries and of the heart.

1307
01:55:19,650 --> 01:55:23,070
I refuse to listen to such radical talk.

1308
01:55:23,195 --> 01:55:28,283
I say that our bank is alive,
it's generous, it's... it's human!

1309
01:55:28,408 --> 01:55:31,286
And we're going to have
such a line of customers

1310
01:55:31,411 --> 01:55:34,581
seeking and getting small loans

1311
01:55:34,706 --> 01:55:38,293
that people will think we're gambling
with the depositors' money.

1312
01:55:38,418 --> 01:55:40,963
And we will be!

1313
01:55:41,088 --> 01:55:44,883
We'll be gambling on the
future of this country.

1314
01:55:46,677 --> 01:55:48,345
I thank you.

1315
01:56:09,867 --> 01:56:12,411
Woody, I can't take it any more.
Let's sit down.

1316
01:56:12,536 --> 01:56:14,580
We can't get out.
I'm trapped.

1317
01:56:14,705 --> 01:56:17,207
How do you do?
Ow!

1318
01:56:17,332 --> 01:56:19,460
Beg your pardon!

1319
01:56:19,585 --> 01:56:22,463
Well, anyway,
we can't fall down.

1320
01:56:24,756 --> 01:56:28,260
Is that table satisfactory?
- Everything's lovely.

1321
01:56:31,388 --> 01:56:34,975
Thank you very much.
Would you care to order now?

1322
01:56:36,059 --> 01:56:37,811
Sorry.

1323
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:50,365
I can't understand it.
- What?

1324
01:56:50,491 --> 01:56:54,536
Why you're not mad about me.
I think I'm attractive.

1325
01:56:54,661 --> 01:56:56,914
You are, Woody.
You're irresistible.

1326
01:56:57,039 --> 01:56:59,333
Then why do you
go on resisting me?

1327
01:56:59,458 --> 01:57:02,169
All marriages don't have
to be like that one.

1328
01:57:02,294 --> 01:57:06,131
Which one?
- Your friends, Fred and Marie.

1329
01:57:06,256 --> 01:57:11,053
What's wrong with their marriage?
- Nothing, except one slight detail.

1330
01:57:11,178 --> 01:57:13,931
They just don't like each other.

1331
01:57:17,893 --> 01:57:20,604
It's murder on the dance floor.
It's awful!

1332
01:57:20,729 --> 01:57:24,691
You don't wanna dance any more?
- Love to! You don't mind if I borrow him?

1333
01:57:24,817 --> 01:57:27,027
No, not at all.

1334
01:57:33,033 --> 01:57:36,954
Why did you do this, Peggy?
- Do what? What do you mean?

1335
01:57:37,079 --> 01:57:41,250
Calling up Marie and going
out like this. Together.

1336
01:57:41,375 --> 01:57:44,169
I did it deliberately.
- Why?

1337
01:57:46,088 --> 01:57:52,594
To prove to myself that what happened
this afternoon didn't really happen.

1338
01:57:56,723 --> 01:57:58,767
But it did happen.

1339
01:57:58,892 --> 01:58:01,019
It had to happen.

1340
01:58:01,145 --> 01:58:05,023
And if we go on seeing each
other, Peggy, it'll happen again.

1341
01:58:16,326 --> 01:58:18,370
Be- bop a- ree- bop

1342
01:58:18,495 --> 01:58:20,873
Be- bop...

1343
01:58:20,998 --> 01:58:23,041
Excuse us.

1344
01:58:25,878 --> 01:58:28,338
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1345
01:58:32,384 --> 01:58:34,928
We want to have a picture
taken in a few minutes.

1346
01:58:35,053 --> 01:58:36,930
Fine.
I'll be here.

1347
01:58:37,055 --> 01:58:39,099
Excuse me.

1348
01:58:42,186 --> 01:58:44,855
Hello, Marie.
- Good evening.

1349
01:58:48,358 --> 01:58:51,445
You got to watch yourself.
More wolves! - I know.

1350
01:58:51,570 --> 01:58:55,073
I'd pay no attention to the sign.
Go right in!

1351
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:02,623
Gee, Woody's a cute boy.
- He's a lot of fun.

1352
01:59:02,748 --> 01:59:05,501
He's got dough, too.
His family own half the city.

1353
01:59:05,626 --> 01:59:07,669
He has a terrific yen for you.

1354
01:59:07,795 --> 01:59:13,675
I don't want to butt into your affairs, but
if you take my advice, you'll grab Woody!

1355
01:59:13,801 --> 01:59:16,678
Woody and I are good friends,
but there's no romance.

1356
01:59:16,804 --> 01:59:22,184
Never mind the romantic part. That takes
care of itself. I speak from experience.

1357
01:59:22,309 --> 01:59:27,439
They'll tell you money isn't everything.
Maybe it isn't but, boy, how it helps!

1358
01:59:27,564 --> 01:59:31,068
While Fred was away I was
drawing over $500 a month.

1359
01:59:31,193 --> 01:59:33,654
I mean,
from his army pay and the job I had.

1360
01:59:33,779 --> 01:59:40,077
Now the two of us gotta live on what Fred
gets from the drugstore. 32.50 a week!

1361
01:59:41,161 --> 01:59:46,834
Poor Fred. Bet you think he's a sourpuss.
He didn't used to be that way, though.

1362
01:59:46,959 --> 01:59:51,672
Army's had an awful effect on him.
Knocked all the life out of him!

1363
01:59:51,797 --> 01:59:55,425
Fred isn't going to be satisfied
with that job at the drugstore.

1364
01:59:55,551 --> 02:00:01,265
He'll get something better. - Maybe
in five years he'll draw 50 bucks.

1365
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:05,936
You can't have happy marriages
on that kind of dough.

1366
02:00:08,564 --> 02:00:13,360
You know, Peggy, you're cute.
But you could use a little more make- up.

1367
02:00:13,485 --> 02:00:17,573
And get yourself a better hairdo.
I'll give you the name of my hairdresser.

1368
02:00:17,698 --> 02:00:20,159
Oh, but you've got
nothing to worry about.

1369
02:00:20,284 --> 02:00:25,539
You'll get Woody and live happily
ever after. It's in the bag!

1370
02:00:29,001 --> 02:00:31,044
Thank you.

1371
02:00:36,258 --> 02:00:40,763
Now, everybody get in close together,
put our arms around each other.

1372
02:00:40,888 --> 02:00:43,390
Come on, Fred.
I don't mind.

1373
02:00:45,309 --> 02:00:49,271
Ooh! Wait, I'll tell you when.
Everybody, happy. Let's all be talking.

1374
02:00:49,396 --> 02:00:52,274
What a marvellous party.
We'll have to do this again.

1375
02:00:52,399 --> 02:00:54,443
OK, shoot the picture!

1376
02:00:56,069 --> 02:00:58,405
We want four copies, honey.

1377
02:01:01,241 --> 02:01:04,536
Mr Milton certainly acted
enthusiastic about your speech.

1378
02:01:04,661 --> 02:01:07,664
Yeah, sure. That's how he acted,
the old hypocrite.

1379
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:12,669
Suppose he'll fire you in the morning?
- No, he'll never do anything impetuous.

1380
02:01:12,795 --> 02:01:16,840
He'll back me up, till the next time
I give a loan to some little guy.

1381
02:01:16,965 --> 02:01:20,010
Then I'll have to fight it out again.

1382
02:01:20,135 --> 02:01:22,679
Yes?
- lt's me, Peggy.

1383
02:01:22,805 --> 02:01:24,848
Oh, come in, darling.

1384
02:01:33,816 --> 02:01:36,235
Did you have a good time?
- Not very.

1385
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:38,904
Ah, what's all this?
Children's Hour?

1386
02:01:39,029 --> 02:01:41,490
I beg your pardon.

1387
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:45,327
Well?
What's she like?

1388
02:01:48,247 --> 02:01:51,291
I'm glad I went out with them.

1389
02:01:51,416 --> 02:01:54,211
Even though it was a
disagreeable experience.

1390
02:01:54,336 --> 02:01:58,048
It took guts, honey.
But you got plenty.

1391
02:01:58,173 --> 02:02:01,385
I'll need them.
I've made up my mind.

1392
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:03,804
Good girl.
- To do what?

1393
02:02:07,808 --> 02:02:10,436
I'm going to break that marriage up.

1394
02:02:11,145 --> 02:02:14,773
I can't stand seeing Fred tied
to a woman he doesn't love.

1395
02:02:14,898 --> 02:02:17,359
And who doesn't love him.

1396
02:02:17,484 --> 02:02:22,489
It's horrible for him. It's humiliating,
and it's killing his spirit.

1397
02:02:22,614 --> 02:02:24,658
Somebody's got to help him.

1398
02:02:24,783 --> 02:02:28,787
Are you sure he doesn't love her?
- Of course I am.

1399
02:02:28,912 --> 02:02:30,956
Did he tell you?

1400
02:02:32,583 --> 02:02:35,085
Did she?
- No.

1401
02:02:35,210 --> 02:02:37,337
So you just jumped to conclusions!

1402
02:02:37,463 --> 02:02:41,341
He doesn't love her,
he hates her. I know it.

1403
02:02:41,467 --> 02:02:44,428
I know it.
- Who are you, God?!

1404
02:02:44,553 --> 02:02:47,598
How did you get this power
to interfere in people's lives?

1405
02:02:47,723 --> 02:02:49,767
Is Fred in love with you?

1406
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:53,020
Yes.

1407
02:02:53,145 --> 02:02:57,858
You've been seeing him?
- Only once. Today.

1408
02:02:57,983 --> 02:03:00,652
Oh, it was all perfectly respectable.

1409
02:03:00,778 --> 02:03:03,947
But when we were
saying goodbye, he...

1410
02:03:04,072 --> 02:03:07,242
he took me in his arms
and kissed me and...

1411
02:03:08,285 --> 02:03:10,162
and I knew.

1412
02:03:10,287 --> 02:03:15,751
You think a kiss from a smooth
operator like Fred means anything?!

1413
02:03:15,876 --> 02:03:20,881
You don't know him. You don't know
anything about what's inside him.

1414
02:03:21,006 --> 02:03:23,967
Neither does she.
His wife.

1415
02:03:24,092 --> 02:03:26,970
That's probably what she thought -

1416
02:03:27,096 --> 02:03:30,015
a smooth operator with
money in his pockets.

1417
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:33,602
But now he isn't smooth any longer,
and she's lost interest.

1418
02:03:33,727 --> 02:03:37,106
Whereas you're possessed
of all the wisdom of the ages

1419
02:03:37,231 --> 02:03:40,692
You can see into the secret
recesses of his innermost soul

1420
02:03:40,818 --> 02:03:43,153
I can see because I love him.

1421
02:03:44,446 --> 02:03:48,117
So you're gonna break this marriage
up. Have you decided how?

1422
02:03:48,242 --> 02:03:50,285
Are you gonna do it with an axe?

1423
02:03:50,410 --> 02:03:53,330
It's none of your business
how I'm going to do it!

1424
02:03:53,455 --> 02:03:56,792
You've forgotten what
it's like to be in love!

1425
02:03:57,876 --> 02:04:04,800
Hear that? I'm so old and decrepit, I've
forgotten how it feels to want somebody.

1426
02:04:05,884 --> 02:04:09,471
Peggy didn't mean that.
Did you, darling?

1427
02:04:11,557 --> 02:04:12,683
No.

1428
02:04:14,268 --> 02:04:16,979
I don't know what I do mean.

1429
02:04:17,104 --> 02:04:21,859
It's just that everything has
always been so perfect for you.

1430
02:04:21,984 --> 02:04:25,237
You loved each other and you
got married in a big church

1431
02:04:25,362 --> 02:04:28,157
and you had a honeymoon
in the South of France.

1432
02:04:28,282 --> 02:04:31,243
You never had any
trouble of any kind.

1433
02:04:31,368 --> 02:04:35,247
So how can you possibly understand
how it is with Fred and me?

1434
02:04:38,292 --> 02:04:40,419
We never had any trouble?

1435
02:04:42,463 --> 02:04:47,259
How many times have I told you I
hated you and believed it in my heart?

1436
02:04:47,718 --> 02:04:52,765
How many times have you said you were
sick of me, that we were all washed up?

1437
02:04:54,391 --> 02:04:58,937
How many times have we had
to fall in love all over again?

1438
02:05:18,373 --> 02:05:20,417
I'm sorry, Mom.

1439
02:05:20,542 --> 02:05:23,378
Never mind about that, darling.

1440
02:05:51,490 --> 02:05:53,450
Fred.
- Hiya, Butch.

1441
02:05:53,575 --> 02:05:55,077
Hello, Fred.
- Al here?

1442
02:05:55,202 --> 02:05:59,540
He's back there, waiting for you.
- See you later.

1443
02:06:02,543 --> 02:06:05,546
Hiya, Al.
- Sit down, Fred.

1444
02:06:05,671 --> 02:06:09,424
What are you drinking? - A cup of
coffee. Gotta have a clear head.

1445
02:06:09,550 --> 02:06:12,719
A cup of coffee and a
bourbon and soda. - Yes, sir.

1446
02:06:12,845 --> 02:06:17,891
What's on your mind, Al? Want to
borrow some money or something?

1447
02:06:18,016 --> 02:06:21,311
I, uh...
called you to ask you a question.

1448
02:06:22,396 --> 02:06:24,440
OK.
Shoot.

1449
02:06:25,899 --> 02:06:28,777
Are you in love with Peggy?

1450
02:06:32,656 --> 02:06:36,410
Is there a law compelling
me to answer? - No.

1451
02:06:36,535 --> 02:06:40,956
Nevertheless, I repeat:
are you in love with Peggy?

1452
02:06:44,668 --> 02:06:45,961
Yes.

1453
02:06:47,671 --> 02:06:50,466
I thank you for a short
and honest answer.

1454
02:06:50,591 --> 02:06:54,428
You're welcome.
Now what do we take up next?

1455
02:06:54,553 --> 02:06:57,139
Your wife.
What about her?

1456
02:06:58,182 --> 02:07:01,602
Where does she fit in
this romantic situation?

1457
02:07:01,727 --> 02:07:04,605
Is that any of your business?

1458
02:07:04,730 --> 02:07:07,775
That's what Peggy said
- that it's none of my business.

1459
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:09,985
Oh, you've had her
on the carpet, too.

1460
02:07:10,110 --> 02:07:13,947
She volunteered some information
to her mother and me.

1461
02:07:14,072 --> 02:07:18,243
You see, we have a rather
unusual relationship in our family.

1462
02:07:18,368 --> 02:07:23,707
It may seem corny and mid- Victorian,
but we tell each other things.

1463
02:07:23,832 --> 02:07:26,084
I happen to be quite
fond of Peggy, and I...

1464
02:07:26,210 --> 02:07:28,420
You don't want her
mixed up with a heel.

1465
02:07:28,545 --> 02:07:31,006
I haven't called you a heel.
Yet.

1466
02:07:32,090 --> 02:07:36,011
I just don't want to see
her get into this mess.

1467
02:07:45,437 --> 02:07:48,190
OK, chum,
what do we do now?

1468
02:07:48,315 --> 02:07:51,026
Step out and settle
this thing in the alley?

1469
02:07:51,151 --> 02:07:53,821
I wouldn't want to recommend
that as a solution.

1470
02:07:53,946 --> 02:07:56,365
I've learned to fight dirty.

1471
02:07:56,490 --> 02:08:00,119
If I got tangled up with you,
I might break your neck.

1472
02:08:00,244 --> 02:08:02,162
I wouldn't like that.

1473
02:08:02,287 --> 02:08:06,625
You see, I'm quite fond of you, too.
- Thanks.

1474
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:10,963
But I don't like the idea of you
sneaking around corners to see Peggy,

1475
02:08:11,088 --> 02:08:14,299
taking her love on a bootleg basis.

1476
02:08:14,424 --> 02:08:18,595
I give you fair warning, I'll do everything
I can to keep her away from you,

1477
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:23,725
to help her forget about you and get her
married to a guy who'll make her happy.

1478
02:08:37,990 --> 02:08:40,242
Then I guess that's it, Al.

1479
02:08:40,367 --> 02:08:42,786
I don't see her any more.

1480
02:08:42,911 --> 02:08:45,914
I'll put that in the
form of a guarantee.

1481
02:08:46,039 --> 02:08:48,625
I won't see her any more.

1482
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:51,003
I'll call her up and tell her so.

1483
02:08:51,128 --> 02:08:53,380
That satisfy you?
- Yeah.

1484
02:08:54,965 --> 02:08:57,801
Anything else on your mind?
- No.

1485
02:08:59,136 --> 02:09:01,263
OK, chum.
So long.

1486
02:09:02,306 --> 02:09:04,349
So long, Fred.

1487
02:09:06,268 --> 02:09:09,188
The drinks are on me.

1488
02:09:31,585 --> 02:09:33,504
Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Steve.

1489
02:09:33,629 --> 02:09:35,714
Say, Al Stephenson's back there.

1490
02:09:35,839 --> 02:09:37,883
Al?
- Yeah.

1491
02:09:38,967 --> 02:09:40,385
Hi, Al.
- Hello, Homer.

1492
02:09:40,511 --> 02:09:42,554
How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

1493
02:09:42,679 --> 02:09:44,890
Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Butch.

1494
02:09:45,015 --> 02:09:47,392
Say, let's show Al that new routine.
- Sure.

1495
02:09:47,518 --> 02:09:51,313
Got something to show you,
Al. Well, come on.

1496
02:09:53,816 --> 02:09:56,360
Boy, wait till you hear this.
- All set, kid?

1497
02:09:56,485 --> 02:09:59,404
I'm ready when you are.
- OK. One, two, three.

1498
02:10:48,078 --> 02:10:50,873
That's fine!

1499
02:10:50,998 --> 02:10:53,584
What's the matter?
Didn't you like it, Al?

1500
02:10:53,709 --> 02:10:57,671
Sure, it was swell. I thought you were
kidding about the piano lessons.

1501
02:10:57,796 --> 02:10:59,840
Fred!
Hey, Fred!

1502
02:11:02,134 --> 02:11:04,303
That was Fred.

1503
02:11:04,428 --> 02:11:05,971
Yeah.

1504
02:11:06,096 --> 02:11:09,558
Is anything wrong? - No, he had
to go back to the drugstore.

1505
02:11:09,683 --> 02:11:12,227
Come on, Homer,
buy me a drink.

1506
02:11:27,826 --> 02:11:30,537
Who was it?

1507
02:11:30,662 --> 02:11:32,706
Fred.

1508
02:11:37,753 --> 02:11:44,176
He said he's sorry for what happened,
but it was just one of those things.

1509
02:11:45,427 --> 02:11:50,349
He said it wouldn't be fair to his wife for
us to see each other any more because...

1510
02:11:50,474 --> 02:11:56,313
I'm obviously the kind of girl that
takes these things too seriously.

1511
02:11:56,438 --> 02:12:00,651
Then he said goodbye,
very politely, and hung up.

1512
02:12:04,488 --> 02:12:09,034
Well, I guess you and Dad won't
have to worry about me any more.

1513
02:12:10,119 --> 02:12:14,039
That's the end of my
career as a home- wrecker.

1514
02:12:24,216 --> 02:12:30,264
Mom, I know you feel sorry for me.
You think my poor little heart is broken.

1515
02:12:30,389 --> 02:12:35,227
But you can save your sympathy.
I can see things clearer now.

1516
02:12:36,311 --> 02:12:38,730
I made a fool of myself.

1517
02:12:38,856 --> 02:12:42,651
I'm getting some sense
hammered into me now.

1518
02:12:42,776 --> 02:12:45,654
I'm glad I'm out of that mess.

1519
02:12:45,779 --> 02:12:49,074
I'm glad I'll never see him again!
I...

1520
02:12:53,162 --> 02:12:56,039
Two chocolate sundaes coming up.

1521
02:13:02,379 --> 02:13:05,048
What about a ham and
cheese on whole- wheat?

1522
02:13:05,174 --> 02:13:07,509
Ham and cheese coming up.

1523
02:13:31,366 --> 02:13:34,495
Here you are.

1524
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:36,330
Thank you.

1525
02:13:38,081 --> 02:13:40,918
Hello, Homer. How've you been?
- Hi, Fred.

1526
02:13:41,043 --> 02:13:43,712
Glad to see you.
- Say, Fred.

1527
02:13:43,837 --> 02:13:46,507
Yeah?
- What happened at Butch's?

1528
02:13:46,632 --> 02:13:50,594
What do you mean?
- You and Al. Was there any trouble?

1529
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:54,848
Oh, no. We were just
having a little friendly chat.

1530
02:13:55,933 --> 02:13:57,434
There you are, sir.
- Thanks.

1531
02:13:57,559 --> 02:14:01,146
What'll yours be, Homer? - Oh, I
don't care. A chocolate sundae.

1532
02:14:01,271 --> 02:14:03,315
OK.

1533
02:14:04,858 --> 02:14:06,193
Hi.

1534
02:14:06,318 --> 02:14:08,612
How are you, soldier?
- Sailor.

1535
02:14:08,737 --> 02:14:10,781
Excuse me.

1536
02:14:12,407 --> 02:14:16,870
Say, uh... do you mind if I
ask you a personal question?

1537
02:14:16,995 --> 02:14:20,457
I know what it is. How did I get
these hooks, and how do they work?

1538
02:14:20,582 --> 02:14:24,878
That's what everybody says when they
start off "Mind if I ask you a question?"

1539
02:14:25,003 --> 02:14:29,007
Well, I'll tell you. I got sick and
tired of that old pair of hands I had.

1540
02:14:29,133 --> 02:14:32,803
An awful lot of trouble, washing
them and manicuring my nails.

1541
02:14:32,928 --> 02:14:35,514
So I traded them in for
these latest models.

1542
02:14:35,639 --> 02:14:38,016
They work by radar.
Look.

1543
02:14:48,694 --> 02:14:52,281
Pretty cute, eh?
- You got plenty of guts.

1544
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:58,162
It's terrible when you see a guy like you
that had to sacrifice himself. For what?

1545
02:14:59,997 --> 02:15:02,791
For what?! I don't get you, mister.
- Well...

1546
02:15:02,916 --> 02:15:05,377
Anything else for you?
- Check.

1547
02:15:06,462 --> 02:15:10,090
We let ourselves get sold down the
river. We were pushed into war.

1548
02:15:10,215 --> 02:15:12,259
Sure, by the Japs and the Nazis.

1549
02:15:12,384 --> 02:15:15,012
The Germans and the Japs
had nothing against us.

1550
02:15:15,137 --> 02:15:17,347
They wanted to fight the
limeys and the Reds.

1551
02:15:17,473 --> 02:15:23,687
They would've whipped 'em, too, if we
didn't get deceived into it by Washington.

1552
02:15:23,812 --> 02:15:26,440
What are you talking about?

1553
02:15:26,565 --> 02:15:29,401
We fought the wrong people,
that's all.

1554
02:15:29,526 --> 02:15:34,072
Just read the facts, my friend. Find out for
yourself why you had to lose your hands.

1555
02:15:34,198 --> 02:15:39,036
Then go out and do something about it.
- You'd better pay your check and go.

1556
02:15:39,161 --> 02:15:43,040
Well, who do you think you are?
- Pay the cashier right over there.

1557
02:15:43,165 --> 02:15:45,000
Coffee, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

1558
02:15:45,125 --> 02:15:52,382
There's another thing. Every soda jerk in
this country's got an idea he's somebody!

1559
02:15:59,431 --> 02:16:01,475
What are you selling anyway?

1560
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:05,104
I'm not selling anything but plain
old- fashioned Americanism.

1561
02:16:05,229 --> 02:16:08,565
Some Americanism!
So we're all a bunch of suckers?

1562
02:16:08,690 --> 02:16:11,527
So we should've been on the
side of the Japs and the Nazis?

1563
02:16:11,652 --> 02:16:15,239
Again I say,
just look at the facts.

1564
02:16:15,364 --> 02:16:20,035
I've seen facts. I've seen a ship go down,
and 400 of my shipmates went with it.

1565
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:22,204
Were those guys suckers?!

1566
02:16:22,329 --> 02:16:26,542
That's the unpleasant truth,
and the sooner we get wise to it...

1567
02:16:26,667 --> 02:16:30,796
Ooh, if I only had my hands!
- You put those down!

1568
02:16:32,714 --> 02:16:35,342
Take your hands off him!

1569
02:16:44,893 --> 02:16:47,980
May I get through, please?

1570
02:16:48,105 --> 02:16:50,107
Go get the druggist.
- Yes, sir.

1571
02:16:50,232 --> 02:16:52,568
Make way, please.
What happened?

1572
02:16:52,693 --> 02:16:56,530
It was Fred Derry. He hit him.
- Bring some iodine and bandages.

1573
02:16:56,655 --> 02:16:59,199
Yes, sir.
- Don't say it, chum.

1574
02:16:59,324 --> 02:17:03,662
The customer's always right, so I'm
fired. But this customer wasn't right.

1575
02:17:03,787 --> 02:17:07,082
I'll meet you outside in a minute, kid.

1576
02:17:43,410 --> 02:17:47,790
Gee, Fred, I'm sorry I lost
you your job. But that guy...

1577
02:17:47,915 --> 02:17:54,421
Yeah, I know. You read about guys like that,
but you don't often see 'em, luckily.

1578
02:17:54,546 --> 02:17:56,590
How about your girlfriend
- Wilma?

1579
02:17:56,715 --> 02:18:00,260
You and she gonna get married?
- I don't know.

1580
02:18:00,385 --> 02:18:03,430
Why don't you know?
Doesn't she want to get married?

1581
02:18:03,555 --> 02:18:06,558
It isn't Wilma's fault.
She's been swell about it.

1582
02:18:06,683 --> 02:18:11,897
So then it's your fault?
- Yeah, I... I guess it is.

1583
02:18:13,482 --> 02:18:16,610
Will you do me a favour, Homer?
- Sure, Fred. What is it?

1584
02:18:16,735 --> 02:18:21,115
I'm a hot one to be giving advice to
the lovelorn, but go see Wilma - now.

1585
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:25,369
Take her in your arms, kiss her, ask
her to marry you, then marry her.

1586
02:18:25,494 --> 02:18:27,746
Tomorrow, if you can get a licence.

1587
02:18:27,871 --> 02:18:32,584
If you want anybody to stand up for you at
your wedding... There's my bus. So long.

1588
02:18:32,709 --> 02:18:34,753
So long, Fred.

1589
02:20:23,195 --> 02:20:26,073
You all right?
- I'm just going to get a glass of milk.

1590
02:20:26,198 --> 02:20:28,367
Just knock on the door
when you want me.

1591
02:20:28,492 --> 02:20:30,536
OK.

1592
02:21:01,859 --> 02:21:04,319
Wilma!
What are you doing out this hour?

1593
02:21:04,445 --> 02:21:08,490
I saw you were up, Homer.
I saw you through the window.

1594
02:21:08,615 --> 02:21:10,659
I've got to talk to you.

1595
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:12,828
All right,
come in.

1596
02:21:21,003 --> 02:21:23,338
Want some chicken?
- No, thanks.

1597
02:21:23,464 --> 02:21:25,591
Sure?
- Yes.

1598
02:21:27,217 --> 02:21:29,845
Want a glass of milk?
- No, thanks, Homer.

1599
02:21:29,970 --> 02:21:32,639
Sit down, Wilma.

1600
02:21:32,765 --> 02:21:37,478
Homer, I... My family want
me to go away, tomorrow.

1601
02:21:39,438 --> 02:21:43,650
Where? - Up to Silver Lake.
My Aunt Vera's place.

1602
02:21:47,613 --> 02:21:49,698
That ought to be nice.

1603
02:21:49,823 --> 02:21:52,117
But I don't want to go.

1604
02:21:52,242 --> 02:21:54,286
I want to stay here.

1605
02:21:56,205 --> 02:22:00,459
You see, the reason they want me
to go is so that I'll forget about you.

1606
02:22:00,584 --> 02:22:04,213
They figure you don't want me
around, you don't want to see me,

1607
02:22:04,338 --> 02:22:08,926
and if I go away for a while, maybe
I'll get all this out of my mind.

1608
02:22:09,051 --> 02:22:11,553
Maybe that's a good idea, Wilma.

1609
02:22:11,678 --> 02:22:14,723
Maybe you ought to do that.

1610
02:22:14,848 --> 02:22:17,101
Do you want to get rid of me?

1611
02:22:18,977 --> 02:22:24,024
Tell me the truth, Homer. Do you
want me to forget about you?

1612
02:22:29,988 --> 02:22:32,241
I want you to be free, Wilma.

1613
02:22:32,366 --> 02:22:35,244
To live your own life.

1614
02:22:35,369 --> 02:22:40,541
I don't want you tied down forever
just because you've got a kind heart.

1615
02:22:40,666 --> 02:22:46,463
Homer, why can't you understand the way
things really are? The way I really feel?

1616
02:22:46,588 --> 02:22:48,715
I keep trying to tell you.

1617
02:22:51,093 --> 02:22:53,971
But... but you don't know, Wilma.

1618
02:22:55,264 --> 02:22:59,143
You don't know what it'd be
like to have to live with me,

1619
02:22:59,268 --> 02:23:04,773
to have to...
face this every day, every night.

1620
02:23:04,898 --> 02:23:07,401
But I can only find out by trying.

1621
02:23:07,526 --> 02:23:12,698
If it turns out I haven't courage
enough, we'll soon know it.

1622
02:23:21,957 --> 02:23:26,420
Wilma, you and I have been close to
each other for a long time, haven't we?

1623
02:23:26,545 --> 02:23:28,589
Ever since we were kids.

1624
02:23:31,341 --> 02:23:33,385
Yes, Homer.

1625
02:23:37,306 --> 02:23:39,558
I'm going upstairs to bed.

1626
02:23:41,685 --> 02:23:47,691
I want you to... I want you to come up
and see for yourself what happens.

1627
02:23:51,653 --> 02:23:53,697
All right, Homer.

1628
02:24:44,706 --> 02:24:48,293
I've learned how to
take this harness off.

1629
02:24:56,969 --> 02:24:59,638
I can wiggle into my pyjama top.

1630
02:25:08,188 --> 02:25:12,067
I'm lucky, I have my elbows.
Some of the boys don't.

1631
02:25:12,192 --> 02:25:16,321
But I can't button 'em up.
- I'll do that, Homer.

1632
02:25:39,803 --> 02:25:41,889
This is when I know I'm helpless.

1633
02:25:42,014 --> 02:25:44,391
My hands are down
there on the bed.

1634
02:25:44,516 --> 02:25:48,187
I can't put them on again without
calling to somebody for help.

1635
02:25:48,312 --> 02:25:51,356
I can't smoke a
cigarette or read a book.

1636
02:25:51,482 --> 02:25:56,320
If that door should blow shut, I can't
open it and get out of this room.

1637
02:25:56,445 --> 02:26:02,993
As dependent as a baby that doesn't know
how to get anything except cry for it.

1638
02:26:04,077 --> 02:26:06,830
Well, now you know, Wilma.

1639
02:26:06,955 --> 02:26:09,458
Now you have an idea of what it is.

1640
02:26:09,583 --> 02:26:11,877
I guess you don't know what to say.

1641
02:26:12,002 --> 02:26:17,341
It's all right. Go on home.
Go away, like your family said.

1642
02:26:18,801 --> 02:26:20,969
I know what to say, Homer.

1643
02:26:21,095 --> 02:26:25,140
I love you.
And I'm never going to leave you.

1644
02:26:25,265 --> 02:26:27,309
Never.

1645
02:26:59,675 --> 02:27:02,386
You mean, you...
you didn't mind?

1646
02:27:02,511 --> 02:27:06,014
Of course not.
I told you I loved you.

1647
02:27:11,854 --> 02:27:13,814
I love you, Wilma.

1648
02:27:13,939 --> 02:27:17,317
I always have, and...
and I always will.

1649
02:27:54,772 --> 02:27:57,649
Good night, darling.
Sleep well.

1650
02:28:07,201 --> 02:28:09,244
Good night, Wilma.

1651
02:29:07,886 --> 02:29:11,640
Hey, sugar. You'd better step on it,
or your husband'll be home.

1652
02:29:11,765 --> 02:29:15,144
He's job- hunting. He won't
come home for another hour.

1653
02:29:15,269 --> 02:29:17,896
And what if he does?
- I don't understand it.

1654
02:29:18,021 --> 02:29:21,692
All this money around and he can't
get into it. What's wrong with him?

1655
02:29:21,817 --> 02:29:25,571
I guess he just isn't very bright.

1656
02:29:30,576 --> 02:29:32,995
How do you do?

1657
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:35,164
Fine, thanks.
Who are you?

1658
02:29:35,289 --> 02:29:38,625
Fred, I want you to meet Cliff Scully,
an old friend of mine.

1659
02:29:38,751 --> 02:29:41,837
Hiya, Freddy.
- Glad to know you, Scully. Get out.

1660
02:29:41,962 --> 02:29:44,590
A tough guy, huh?
- Now listen, Fred.

1661
02:29:44,715 --> 02:29:48,469
You won't get anywhere with
that attitude. Cliff's an old friend.

1662
02:29:48,594 --> 02:29:51,430
He's asked me out,
and I'm going out.

1663
02:29:51,555 --> 02:29:55,017
You heard me, chum. Get out.
- What do I do next? Smack him?

1664
02:29:55,142 --> 02:29:57,811
Why ask her?
Can't you think for yourself?

1665
02:29:57,936 --> 02:30:00,647
Go on. I can handle this.
Wait for me downstairs.

1666
02:30:00,773 --> 02:30:02,816
OK.

1667
02:30:12,493 --> 02:30:14,536
Another ex- serviceman, huh?

1668
02:30:14,661 --> 02:30:18,081
Greetings. Have you had any
trouble getting readjusted?

1669
02:30:18,207 --> 02:30:22,377
Not in particular. It's easy if you
just take everything in your stride.

1670
02:30:22,503 --> 02:30:25,339
That's what I've heard.

1671
02:30:28,425 --> 02:30:30,761
Be seeing you.
- I doubt it.

1672
02:30:32,596 --> 02:30:35,516
When did you pick him up?
- He's an old friend.

1673
02:30:35,641 --> 02:30:39,019
He just dropped in
for a friendly drink.

1674
02:30:40,687 --> 02:30:43,816
Did you know him while I was away?
- I knew lots of people.

1675
02:30:43,941 --> 02:30:47,903
What do you think I did all those years?
- I don't know, but I can guess.

1676
02:30:48,028 --> 02:30:51,156
Go ahead, guess.
I could do some guessing myself.

1677
02:30:51,281 --> 02:30:54,952
What were you up to in London
and Paris and all those places?

1678
02:30:55,077 --> 02:30:59,998
I've given you every chance to make
something of yourself. I gave up my job.

1679
02:31:00,124 --> 02:31:04,211
I gave up the best years of my life!
And what have you done? You've flopped.

1680
02:31:04,336 --> 02:31:06,630
Couldn't even hold a
job at the drugstore.

1681
02:31:06,755 --> 02:31:10,801
So I'm going back to work for myself.
And I'm going to live for myself, too.

1682
02:31:10,926 --> 02:31:14,847
And in case you don't understand
English, I'm gonna get a divorce.

1683
02:31:14,972 --> 02:31:17,641
What have you got to say to that?

1684
02:31:21,645 --> 02:31:24,523
Don't keep Cliff waiting.

1685
02:31:26,275 --> 02:31:28,986
What are you gonna do?
- I'm going away.

1686
02:31:29,111 --> 02:31:33,240
Where? - As far away from
Boone City as I can get.

1687
02:31:33,365 --> 02:31:37,744
That's a good idea.
You'll get a good job someplace else.

1688
02:31:37,870 --> 02:31:40,831
There are drugstores everywhere.

1689
02:32:17,159 --> 02:32:19,953
Here's an old sweater I found.
Remember?

1690
02:32:20,078 --> 02:32:22,122
Sure.
- You might need it sometime.

1691
02:32:22,247 --> 02:32:25,459
Thanks, Hortense.
- You forgot these, son.

1692
02:32:25,584 --> 02:32:28,879
Oh, I don't want 'em, Pop.
- What are they?

1693
02:32:29,004 --> 02:32:32,341
Fancy words that don't mean
anything. You can throw 'em away.

1694
02:32:32,466 --> 02:32:36,095
Say, these are citations
for your medals.

1695
02:32:36,220 --> 02:32:38,472
Why, Freddy,
you never showed them to us.

1696
02:32:38,597 --> 02:32:41,391
Those things came in the
packages with K rations.

1697
02:32:41,517 --> 02:32:44,311
Well, we'll treasure them,
my boy.

1698
02:32:44,436 --> 02:32:47,397
I'll get the socks I washed for you.

1699
02:32:49,399 --> 02:32:51,610
Think you're doing
the right thing, son?

1700
02:32:51,735 --> 02:32:56,824
Going? Who's to say in advance whether
it's the right thing or the wrong thing?

1701
02:32:56,949 --> 02:32:59,576
It just means a fresh
start in some other place.

1702
02:32:59,701 --> 02:33:02,579
How do you know it'll be
different anyplace else?

1703
02:33:02,704 --> 02:33:07,543
There's a need here for fellas like
yourself that fought and won the war.

1704
02:33:07,668 --> 02:33:12,256
I know you haven't had the best of
breaks since you got back, but...

1705
02:33:12,381 --> 02:33:18,887
you ought to stick here and slug it out a
while longer on your own home ground.

1706
02:33:20,222 --> 02:33:22,349
You're all right, Pop.

1707
02:33:22,474 --> 02:33:25,644
But I know when it's time to bail out.

1708
02:33:25,769 --> 02:33:27,813
I gotta get going.

1709
02:33:32,568 --> 02:33:36,989
Here are your clean socks, Fred.
- Just put 'em in here.

1710
02:33:37,114 --> 02:33:40,200
Take good care of the old man.
- I'll do my best.

1711
02:33:40,325 --> 02:33:44,705
But we'll miss you, Freddy. - You
ought to be used to that by now.

1712
02:33:44,830 --> 02:33:46,874
So long, Pop.

1713
02:34:15,152 --> 02:34:19,531
We've got two flights going out of here
tonight. One eastbound, one westbound.

1714
02:34:19,656 --> 02:34:22,701
You'll have to ask the pilot.
Which way you going?

1715
02:34:22,826 --> 02:34:24,870
Which one leaves first?

1716
02:34:25,996 --> 02:34:28,082
Eastbound.
Eight o'clock.

1717
02:34:28,207 --> 02:34:31,877
That'll be fine. I'll just hang
around the field until then.

1718
02:34:32,002 --> 02:34:34,254
You don't seem to care
where you're going.

1719
02:34:34,379 --> 02:34:36,840
That's right, chum.
I don't.

1720
02:34:50,270 --> 02:34:52,314
Hortense.

1721
02:34:52,773 --> 02:34:54,441
Hortense!

1722
02:34:54,566 --> 02:34:57,486
Listen to this.
Sit down.

1723
02:34:57,611 --> 02:35:02,658
"Headquarters, 8th Air Force. Award
of the Distinguished Flying Cross."

1724
02:35:02,783 --> 02:35:04,827
Um... Here.

1725
02:35:05,911 --> 02:35:09,498
"Despite intense pain,
shock and loss of blood,

1726
02:35:09,623 --> 02:35:12,668
with complete disregard
of his personal safety,

1727
02:35:12,793 --> 02:35:15,421
Captain Derry crawled
back to his bombsight,

1728
02:35:15,546 --> 02:35:18,841
guided his formation on a
perfect run over the objective

1729
02:35:18,966 --> 02:35:22,094
and released his bombs
with great accuracy."

1730
02:35:22,219 --> 02:35:27,766
"The heroism, devotion to duty,
professional skill and coolness under fire

1731
02:35:27,891 --> 02:35:31,395
displayed by Captain Derry,

1732
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:35,107
under the most difficult conditions,

1733
02:35:35,232 --> 02:35:41,947
reflect highest credit on himself and the
Armed Forces of the United States."

1734
02:35:43,490 --> 02:35:47,619
"By command of Lieutenant
General Doolittle."

1735
02:38:55,015 --> 02:38:58,727
Hey, bud,
what are you doing up there?

1736
02:39:00,229 --> 02:39:02,272
Hey, you!

1737
02:39:03,232 --> 02:39:06,276
What are you doing in that airplane?

1738
02:39:27,256 --> 02:39:31,844
I used to work in one of those.
- Reviving old memories, huh?

1739
02:39:31,969 --> 02:39:34,555
Or maybe getting some
of 'em out of my system.

1740
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:37,641
Well, take your last look.
We're breaking 'em up.

1741
02:39:37,766 --> 02:39:41,687
Yeah, I know. You're the junkman.
You get everything sooner or later.

1742
02:39:41,812 --> 02:39:47,609
This is no junk. We're using this material
for building prefabricated houses.

1743
02:39:47,734 --> 02:39:49,862
You don't need any help,
do you?

1744
02:39:49,987 --> 02:39:52,156
Out of a job?
- That's it.

1745
02:39:52,281 --> 02:39:55,576
I see. One of the fallen
angels of the air force.

1746
02:39:55,701 --> 02:39:58,078
Well, pardon me if I
show no sympathy.

1747
02:39:58,203 --> 02:40:02,416
While you glamour boys were up in the
wild blue yonder, I was down in a tank.

1748
02:40:02,541 --> 02:40:06,086
Sometime I'll be glad to hear the
story of your war experiences.

1749
02:40:06,211 --> 02:40:10,174
What I asked you for was a job.
Have you got one?

1750
02:40:10,299 --> 02:40:14,553
Do you know anything about building?
- No. But I know how to learn.

1751
02:40:14,678 --> 02:40:17,473
Same as I learned that job up there.

1752
02:40:20,017 --> 02:40:22,102
Hey, Gus.
- Yes?

1753
02:40:22,227 --> 02:40:24,772
See if you think this guy
can be of any use to us.

1754
02:40:24,897 --> 02:40:26,940
Thanks.

1755
02:40:37,409 --> 02:40:40,079
Now, children,
let's remember the words.

1756
02:40:40,204 --> 02:40:44,500
The bride will come down those stairs.
When I see her I'll hit the first note,

1757
02:40:44,625 --> 02:40:47,586
then I'll nod my head
and then we'll sing, huh?

1758
02:40:47,711 --> 02:40:49,755
All right,
let's try it.

1759
02:40:51,048 --> 02:40:52,424
Here she comes.
-  Here...

1760
02:40:52,549 --> 02:40:54,468
Wait for the note.

1761
02:40:54,593 --> 02:40:56,804
Here's comes the bri...

1762
02:40:56,929 --> 02:40:58,639
That's fine.

1763
02:41:05,562 --> 02:41:07,815
Mrs Cameron?
- Yes. Mrs Stephenson?

1764
02:41:07,940 --> 02:41:09,900
Yes.
- Come right in, won't you?

1765
02:41:10,025 --> 02:41:11,693
My daughter.
- How do you do?

1766
02:41:11,819 --> 02:41:14,113
How do you do, Mrs Cameron?
- How do you do?

1767
02:41:14,238 --> 02:41:16,365
There you go.
- You shouldn't have.

1768
02:41:16,490 --> 02:41:18,283
My daughter.
- Miss Stephenson.

1769
02:41:18,408 --> 02:41:20,536
Hello.
- Hello, Mr Cameron.

1770
02:41:20,661 --> 02:41:22,621
Meet Homer's folks.

1771
02:41:22,746 --> 02:41:25,457
Mr and Mrs Stephenson.
Miss Stephenson.

1772
02:41:25,582 --> 02:41:27,418
How do you do?
- How do you do?

1773
02:41:27,543 --> 02:41:29,002
Hello, Al.
- Hello, Butch!

1774
02:41:29,128 --> 02:41:31,964
It's good you're here.
- Mr Stephenson, punch?

1775
02:41:32,089 --> 02:41:33,465
Hello, Butch.

1776
02:41:33,590 --> 02:41:37,511
How do you do, Mrs Stephenson?
- How do you do?

1777
02:41:40,055 --> 02:41:42,558
Steady, boy!

1778
02:41:46,603 --> 02:41:51,733
I heard you were leaving town. I was
afraid you wouldn't stand up for me.

1779
02:41:51,859 --> 02:41:54,111
I'll stand up for you, kid,
till I drop.

1780
02:41:54,236 --> 02:41:57,281
Oh, Fred,
here's the ring.

1781
02:41:57,406 --> 02:41:59,450
Don't lose it.

1782
02:42:00,367 --> 02:42:03,704
Hiya, Homer. Big day, huh?
- Hi, Al.

1783
02:42:03,829 --> 02:42:06,749
Hiya, Fred.
- Hello, Al.

1784
02:42:06,874 --> 02:42:10,502
I, uh... I hear you moved
back with your folks.

1785
02:42:10,627 --> 02:42:13,046
Yeah.

1786
02:42:13,172 --> 02:42:16,550
I've sampled the punch. I presume
it was made for the kiddies.

1787
02:42:16,675 --> 02:42:20,971
Will you have some, Homer?
- I might give the wrong answers.

1788
02:42:21,096 --> 02:42:24,641
How about you, Fred?
- No, thanks. Maybe later.

1789
02:42:24,767 --> 02:42:27,895
Well, if I must be a solitary drinker,
good luck, kid.

1790
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:31,023
Thank you, Al.
- Al! You promised you wouldn't.

1791
02:42:31,148 --> 02:42:34,276
Take a sip of this.
- Hello, Fred. Homer.

1792
02:42:34,401 --> 02:42:38,363
There isn't a headache in a
barrel of it. - Al can take it.

1793
02:42:38,489 --> 02:42:40,532
He certainly can.
- Excuse me.

1794
02:42:40,657 --> 02:42:42,701
See for yourself.

1795
02:43:17,361 --> 02:43:19,655
Hello, Fred.
Nice to see you again.

1796
02:43:19,780 --> 02:43:22,699
Hello, Peggy.
Nice to see you.

1797
02:43:24,243 --> 02:43:27,663
Well, what have you been
doing with yourself lately?

1798
02:43:27,788 --> 02:43:29,957
Working.

1799
02:43:31,875 --> 02:43:36,630
Yes... Dad told me he heard you
were in some kind of building work.

1800
02:43:38,048 --> 02:43:40,509
Well, it's a hopeful way of putting it.

1801
02:43:40,634 --> 02:43:43,011
I'm really in the junk business.

1802
02:43:43,137 --> 02:43:47,099
An occupation for which many
people feel I'm well qualified,

1803
02:43:47,224 --> 02:43:49,476
by temperament and training.

1804
02:43:49,601 --> 02:43:51,645
It's fascinating work.

1805
02:43:52,980 --> 02:43:56,400
Where's Homer? Wilma's ready.
- I'll get him.

1806
02:43:56,525 --> 02:43:58,569
Excuse me.

1807
02:44:00,779 --> 02:44:03,949
Mary, Kay, go ahead.
Jackie. Jackie!

1808
02:44:05,534 --> 02:44:07,578
Over here.

1809
02:44:24,470 --> 02:44:26,054
Watch me.

1810
02:44:26,180 --> 02:44:30,058
Here comes the bride

1811
02:44:30,184 --> 02:44:34,480
All dressed in white

1812
02:44:34,605 --> 02:44:43,113
Sweetly serene in the soft,
glowing light

1813
02:44:43,238 --> 02:44:47,576
Lovely to see

1814
02:44:47,701 --> 02:44:51,580
Marching to thee

1815
02:44:51,705 --> 02:44:56,043
Sweet love united

1816
02:44:56,168 --> 02:45:01,715
For eternity

1817
02:45:05,135 --> 02:45:09,973
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God and this company

1818
02:45:10,099 --> 02:45:14,394
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony.

1819
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:18,941
If any man can show just cause why
they may not lawfully be joined together,

1820
02:45:19,066 --> 02:45:23,946
let him now speak, or else
hereafter forever hold his peace.

1821
02:45:24,530 --> 02:45:27,282
Homer, wilt thou have this
woman to thy wedded wife?

1822
02:45:27,407 --> 02:45:28,742
I will.

1823
02:45:28,867 --> 02:45:31,954
Wilma, wilt thou have this
man to thy wedded husband?

1824
02:45:32,079 --> 02:45:33,539
I will.

1825
02:45:33,664 --> 02:45:36,166
Who gives this woman to
be married to this man?

1826
02:45:36,291 --> 02:45:38,168
I do.

1827
02:45:38,293 --> 02:45:44,508
Now, Homer, will you take Wilma's
right hand in yours and say after me:

1828
02:45:44,633 --> 02:45:47,344
I, Homer, take thee, Wilma,
to my wedded wife.

1829
02:45:47,678 --> 02:45:50,472
I, Homer, take thee, Wilma,
to my wedded wife.

1830
02:45:50,597 --> 02:45:53,016
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

1831
02:45:53,350 --> 02:45:55,853
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

1832
02:45:55,978 --> 02:45:59,022
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

1833
02:45:59,356 --> 02:46:02,317
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

1834
02:46:02,443 --> 02:46:06,697
In sickness and in health. To love
and to cherish till death us do part.

1835
02:46:07,030 --> 02:46:13,537
In sickness and in health. To love and
to cherish till death do... us do part.

1836
02:46:13,662 --> 02:46:19,501
Now, Wilma, with your right hand, take
Homer by his right hand and say after me:

1837
02:46:21,754 --> 02:46:24,590
I, Wilma, take thee, Homer,
to my wedded husband.

1838
02:46:24,923 --> 02:46:27,801
I, Wilma, take thee, Homer,
to my wedded husband.

1839
02:46:27,926 --> 02:46:30,262
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

1840
02:46:30,596 --> 02:46:33,348
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

1841
02:46:33,474 --> 02:46:36,560
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

1842
02:46:36,894 --> 02:46:39,730
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

1843
02:46:39,855 --> 02:46:44,693
In sickness and in health. To love
and to cherish till death us do part.

1844
02:46:45,235 --> 02:46:51,283
In sickness and in health. To love
and to cherish till death us do part.

1845
02:46:51,408 --> 02:46:53,452
The ring.

1846
02:46:59,124 --> 02:47:03,462
Place it on the fourth
finger of Wilma's left hand.

1847
02:47:25,442 --> 02:47:27,736
Repeat after me:

1848
02:47:27,861 --> 02:47:29,780
With this ring,
I thee wed.

1849
02:47:30,114 --> 02:47:32,366
With this ring,
I thee wed.

1850
02:47:39,373 --> 02:47:44,002
Those whom God hath joined
together, let not man put asunder.

1851
02:47:44,128 --> 02:47:48,132
For as much as Homer and Wilma have
consented together in holy wedlock

1852
02:47:48,257 --> 02:47:51,427
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company,

1853
02:47:51,552 --> 02:47:55,556
and thereto have given and pledged
their troth, each to the other,

1854
02:47:55,681 --> 02:48:00,769
and have declared the same by giving
and receiving a ring, and by joining hands,

1855
02:48:00,894 --> 02:48:04,189
I pronounce that they
are man and wife.

1856
02:48:04,314 --> 02:48:06,358
God bless you both.

1857
02:48:42,060 --> 02:48:44,563
You know what it'll be,
don't you, Peggy?

1858
02:48:44,688 --> 02:48:47,524
It may take us years
to get anywhere.

1859
02:48:47,649 --> 02:48:51,195
We'll have no money,
no decent place to live.

1860
02:48:51,320 --> 02:48:54,823
We'll have to work,
get kicked around...
