1
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,630
<i>You brush past</i>
<i>so many people every day.</i>

2
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,750
<i>Some you may never know</i>
<i>anything about,</i>

3
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,290
<i>but others might become</i>
<i>your friend someday.</i>

4
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,290
<i>I'm a cop. My name is He Qiwu,</i>

5
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,040
<i>and 223 is my badge number.</i>

6
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,040
Move it!

7
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,500
Freeze!

8
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,000
Out of the way!

9
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,960
Hey!

10
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,710
<i>That was the closest</i>
<i>we ever got...</i>

11
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,000
<i>just 0.01 cm between us.</i>

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,120
<i>Fifty-seven hours later,</i>

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,040
<i>I fell in love with this woman.</i>

14
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,710
Hello? Ma'am? This is Qiwu.

15
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,250
No, I called to talk to you,
not May.

16
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,000
How are you?

17
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,370
Oh, I'm fine.

18
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,710
Yes, best to let May
cool down for a while.

19
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,420
I'm sure she'll call
when she's ready.

20
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,000
Please don't tell her
I called, okay?

21
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,210
You're going to a movie?
I won't keep you.

22
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,160
Is your husband there?

23
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,460
Sir? This is Qiwu.

24
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,670
No, don't call May.
I just called to say hi to you.

25
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,500
Is your cough better?

26
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,290
You're rushing out?
I won't keep you then. No, it's all right.

27
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,210
Is May's sister there? No?

28
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,840
How about her other sister?
I just wanted to say hi.

29
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,000
<i>We all have our habits.</i>
<i>Mine is to wait here</i>

30
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,500
<i>for May to get off work.</i>

31
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,160
<i>The boss here says she looks like</i>
<i>Yamaguchi Momoe. She likes that.</i>

32
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,290
<i>She and I just broke up.</i>

33
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,330
<i>She wished I were more like</i>
<i>Tomokazu Miura myself.</i>

34
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,460
Message for account 368?

35
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,710
Password is
"Love You for 10,000 Years."

36
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,750
Call Ming? You mean May?

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,580
Spell it.

38
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,040
M-I-N-G? It's not M-A-Y?

39
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,120
Sure there's no mistake?
You're sure?

40
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,420
Don't you know English?

41
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,960
Ming? I knew it!

42
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,330
I guess May asked you to call.

43
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,670
I'm fine.
Tell her not to worry, okay?

44
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,290
I'll take good care of myself.

45
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,460
But tell her she can call
anytime she wants.

46
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,920
No reason to bother you.

47
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,750
She didn't tell you to call me?

48
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,040
Then why did you page me?

49
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,250
You're jogging?
Did you get dumped again?

50
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,370
No? Then why go jogging?

51
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,120
A race? You've lost your mind!

52
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,040
Jogging is private.
You don't jog for an audience.

53
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,960
Forget it. Bye.

54
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,370
<i>We all get our hearts broken</i>
<i>sometime.</i>

55
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,670
<i>Whenever I do, I go jogging.</i>

56
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,540
<i>The body loses water</i>
<i>when you jog,</i>

57
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,250
<i>so I don't cry as easily.</i>

58
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,290
<i>I can't be crying.</i>

59
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,120
<i>May always thought</i>
<i>I was a cool guy.</i>

60
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,290
Still no go with your girlfriend?

61
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,370
It's been a month.

62
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,500
Find someone else.

63
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,420
How about May here?
She's not bad.

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,670
She's off early tonight.
Ask her out.

65
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,630
She has a crush on you.

66
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,920
Can't. I have a date tonight.

67
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,750
Some other time.

68
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,210
Is this one okay, miss?

69
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,920
Get a bigger one,
but nothing fancy.

70
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,670
Give them some beers.

71
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,000
Check, please.

72
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,420
<i>Sometimes I'd spend</i>
<i>the night at May's.</i>

73
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,210
<i>So her parents</i>
<i>wouldn't find out,</i>

74
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,080
<i>I'd climb down</i>
<i>from the balcony.</i>

75
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,210
<i>Will I ever get</i>
<i>to do that again?</i>

76
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,040
- How much?
- $2,500.

77
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,710
These too.

78
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,580
<i>The date on the can tells me</i>

79
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,040
<i>I don't have much time left.</i>

80
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,120
<i>If I don't find those Indians,</i>
<i>I'll be in deep trouble.</i>

81
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,580
<i>I don't know when</i>
<i>I started being so cautious.</i>

82
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,580
<i>If I put on a raincoat,</i>
<i>I wear sunglasses too.</i>

83
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,370
<i>You never know if it's going</i>
<i>to rain or be sunny.</i>

92
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,040
<i>Every day I buy</i>

93
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,160
<i>a can of pineapple</i>
<i>with an expiration date of May 1,</i>

94
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,500
<i>because May loves pineapple,</i>

95
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,670
<i>and May 1 is my birthday.</i>

96
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,500
<i>I tell myself</i>

97
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,580

<i>by the time I've bought 30 cans,</i>

98
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,420
<i>then our love will expire too.</i>

99
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,080
Sir, this can expires tomorrow.

100
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,540
Why don't you get another one?

101
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,330
It's all right.

102
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,840
What time's
your earliest flight tomorrow?

103
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,670
I want to reserve a seat.

104
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,540
One person.

105
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,370
- Have you seen these people?
- No.

106
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,250
Look carefully.
They have kids with them.

107
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,330
I really don't know.

108
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,290
- You really don't know him?
- No, I don't.

109
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,630
I've seen you talking to him!

110
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,210
- Papa!
- It's all right.

111
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,630
My daughter!

112
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,580
Hello?

113
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,750
What do you want?

114
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,460
If you don't have some news
within an hour,

115
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,210
you'll never see
your daughter again.

116
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,670
An ice cream for her, please.

117
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,580
Papa!

118
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,460
<i>Some men might sacrifice</i>
<i>their own kid for money,</i>

119
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:12,580

<i>One hour later, I left.</i>

120
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,330

121
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,210

123
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,370
<i>Whenever I had good news,</i>
<i>I always wanted May</i>

124
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,540
<i>to be the first to know.</i>

125
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,120
<i>Hello?</i>

126
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,630
I'll kill you, Tomokazu Miura!

127
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,080
You have any pineapple
that expires on May 1?

128
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,290
- What's the date today?
- April 30.

129
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,000
That's right.
Think I stock outdated goods?

130
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,000
There's still two hours to go.

131
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,880
Nobody wants stale goods.
Get a fresh can.

132
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,000
With you people it's always
"Out with the old, in with the new!"

133
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,420
You realize what goes
into making a can of pineapple?

134
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,080
The fruit is grown, harvested, sliced -
and you just throw it away!

135
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,250
How do you think
the pineapple feels?

136
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,290
Buddy, I just work here.

137
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,120
Who cares about the pineapple?
What about how I feel?

138
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,290
I stock and restock
this stuff all day.

139
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,370
I wish it would never expire.
It'd save me loads of work.

140
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,370
You like expired goods?

141
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,000
Have a whole case on the house.

142
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,790
<i>When did everything start</i>

143
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,370
<i>having an expiration date?</i>

144
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,330
<i>Swordfish expires.</i>
<i>Meat sauce expires.</i>

145
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,120
<i>Even plastic wrap expires.</i>

146
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,540
<i>I'm starting to wonder: Is there</i>
<i>anything in this world that doesn't?</i>

147
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,790
Buddy,
how about some swordfish?

148
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's expired. I don't want it.

149
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,460
You don't want it?

150
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,210
<i>I finally found my 30th can</i>

151
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,580
<i>in a convenience store.</i>

152
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,880
<i>As May 1 begins,</i>
<i>I begin to understand.</i>

153
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,880
<i>In May's eyes,</i>

154
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
<i>I'm no dierent</i>
<i>from a can of pineapple.</i>

155
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,840
You don't want any?
It's delicious.

156
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,330
<i>People say dogs</i>
<i>are man's best friend.</i>

157
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,540
<i>So how come mine</i>
<i>won't share my grief now?</i>

158
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,040
<i>This must be</i>
<i>some kind of record.</i>

159
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,540
<i>I ate all 30 cans that night.</i>

160
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,210
<i>Good thing for me</i>
<i>that May wasn't into durian.</i>

161
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,540
<i>I feel like going out</i>
<i>and celebrating.</i>

162
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,960
<i>May's probably in bed by now.</i>

163
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,460
<i>But what about that other May?</i>

164
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,250
What brings you back here?

165
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm thinking of going
to a late movie.

166
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,370
She's long gone.

167
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,920
Gone?

168
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,790
You thought she'd wait around?
Women can't afford to.

169
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,880
The longer they wait,
the more nervous they get.

170
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,000
Drives them crazy.

171
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,500
She just left with Richard.

172
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,290
You gotta move quickly.

173
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,120
<i>I never dreamed</i>

174
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,120
<i>two Mays could dump me</i>
<i>in one night.</i>

175
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,960
<i>To get over it, I resolve</i>

176
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,040
<i>never to go out</i>
<i>with another May.</i>

177
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,960
Hello? Lulu?

178
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,040
This is Qiwu.

179
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,290
Want to come out for a drink?

180
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,840
You're in bed already?

181
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,210
This early?

182
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,210
You were asleep?

183
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,580
Never mind. Bye.

184
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,540
Hello?

185
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,540
Guess who.

186
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,080
Bingo!

187
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,670
Want to come out for a drink?

188
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,080
Your husband won't let you?
When did you get married?

189
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,630
Five years ago?

190
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,630
We haven't seen each other
in over five years?

191
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,880
You have two kids?

192
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,670
You're happy. That's great.

193
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,160
Well, all the best.

194
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,000
Bye.

195
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,880
Is Kong Siu-Wai there?

196
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,880
This is He Qiwu.

197
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,080
We went to fourth grade together.
You remember?

198
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,710
You don't?

199
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,880
Doesn't matter. Bye.

200
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,580
<i>Those 30 cans of pineapple</i>
<i>had left me feeling queasy,</i>

201
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,840
<i>so I went to a bar.</i>

202
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,040
<i>I'd heard alcohol</i>
<i>can settle the stomach.</i>

203
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,330
Are you okay?

204
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,290
Fine. Another double.

205
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,670
<i>There's a song called</i>
<i>"Love Dies at Dawn."</i>

206
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,330
<i>That's how I feel now.</i>

207
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,580
<i>What can I do to forget May?</i>

208
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,790
<i>I tell myself I'll fall in love</i>

209
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,250
<i>with the first woman</i>
<i>who walks in.</i>

210
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,040
What can I get you?

211
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,790
Whiskey, please.

212
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,630
<i>I have a feeling she'll like me,</i>

213
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,120
<i>but just to be safe,</i>
<i>I decide to ask her a question.</i>

214
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,370
Excuse me, miss,
do you like pineapple?

215
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,750
<i>Maybe she's not Cantonese.</i>

216
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,960
Tell me, do you like pineapple?

217
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,540
Do you like pineapple, miss?

218
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,710
Your Mandarin's not bad.

219
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,160
I grew up in Taiwan.
What about you?

220
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,040
I'm not in the mood to talk.

221
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,120
Please leave me alone.

222
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,120
We don't have to talk.

223
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,370
Could I just sit here?

224
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,960
There are lots of seats.
Why do you have to sit next to me?

225
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,000
I can tell you're lonely.

226
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,540
Really?

227
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,210
Yes.

228
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:09,540
There are only three reasons
a woman would wear shades this late.

229
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,080
First, she's blind.

230
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,370
Second, she's a poseur.

231
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,210
Or third, she got jilted

232
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,580
and doesn't want people
to see she's been crying.

233
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,750
And which one am I?

234
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,540
The jilted woman.

235
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,540
It's okay.

236
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,920
It happens all the time.
Why cry about it?

237
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,540
I've been there too.
I usually go jogging.

238
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,960
I run until I work up a sweat.

239
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,840
Then there's no water left
for tears.

240
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,250
Wanna try it?

241
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,960
I've been running around
all night. I'm exhausted.

242
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,080
If you're looking to chat,

243
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,330
please find someone else.

244
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,250
I don't particularly
want to talk.

245
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,630
I just want
to keep you company.

246
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,920
I know how it feels
to have your heart broken.

247
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,460
A heartbroken woman
needs a shoulder to lean on.

248
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,630
You can pretend
I'm your boyfriend if you want.

249
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,120
I don't have a boyfriend.

250
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,330
And I don't have a girlfriend.

251
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,630
How old are you?

252
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:27,960
Two hours ago, I was still 24.
Now I'm 25.

253
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,540
I won't like you.

254
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,630
Don't be so sure.

255
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,500
Give me a chance.
We might hit it off.

256
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,290
Do you like pineapple?

257
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,580
What business is that of yours?

258
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,330
I'm just trying
to learn more about you.

259
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,710
I was involved
with a girl for five years.

260
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,500
But then she dumped me.

261
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,460
She said
I didn't understand her.

262
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,000
So I want to get to know you.

263
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,160
You'll never get to know me.

264
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:11,750
Fine.
Then try to get to know me.

265
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,000
What kind of man do you like?

266
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:23,040
<i>Actually, really knowing someone</i>
<i>doesn't mean anything.</i>

267
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,630
<i>People change.</i>

268
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,630
<i>A person may like</i>
<i>pineapple today</i>

269
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,040
<i>and something else tomorrow.</i>

270
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,790
Sir!

271
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,000
We're closing up.

272
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,880
They're closing.

273
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,330
Wanna go jogging?

274
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,000
I just want somewhere to rest.

275
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,080
<i>When she said "rest",</i>
<i>I didn't think she actually meant it.</i>

276
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,290
<i>That night, I watched</i>
<i>two old movies on TV</i>

277
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,750
<i>and had four chef's salads.</i>

278
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,790
<i>When the sun rose,</i>
<i>I knew I had to go.</i>

279
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,040
<i>As I was leaving,</i>
<i>I took off her shoes.</i>

280
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,250
<i>My mother used to say</i>
<i>a woman's feet swell up</i>

281
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,500
<i>if she sleeps in high heels.</i>

282
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,120
<i>She must have walked</i>
<i>a lot that night.</i>

283
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,630
<i>Such a pretty woman</i>
<i>should have clean shoes.</i>

284
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,540
<i>I was actually born</i>
<i>at 6:00 a.m.,</i>

285
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,040
<i>so I'll really be 25</i>
<i>two minutes from now.</i>

286
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:07,370
<i>I've spent a quarter of a century</i>
<i>on this planet!</i>

287
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,210
<i>To celebrate this historic moment,</i>
<i>I go jogging.</i>

288
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,460
<i>I'll get rid of my body's</i>
<i>excess water.</i>

289
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,460
<i>It feels good.</i>

290
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:27,080
<i>As I leave the track,</i>
<i>I decide to ditch my pager.</i>

291
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,460
<i>I know very well</i>
<i>no one's gonna call me today.</i>

292
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,790
Account 368.

293
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,920
<i>Password, please.</i>

294
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,630
<i>"Love You for 10,000 Years."</i>

295
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,330
<i>Your friend in room 702 says</i>
<i>happy birthday.</i>

296
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,750
Thank you.

297
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,290
<i>On May 1, 1994,</i>

298
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,080
<i>a woman wishes me</i>
<i>happy birthday.</i>

299
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:48,160
<i>Now I'll remember her</i>
<i>all my life.</i>

300
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,880
<i>If memories ever come in a can,</i>

301
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,670
<i>I hope that can never expires.</i>

302
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,750
<i>If it has to have a shelf life,</i>
<i>I hope it's 10,000 years.</i>

303
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,960
A Coke, please.

304
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,250
Jogging again?

305
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,000
Running around
isn't gonna solve anything.

306
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,000
Listen, Faye's not bad either.

307
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,040
Who's Faye?

308
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:30,080
Just started here today.

309
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:34,250
Make your move
before Richard beats you to it.

310
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,160
- I'm not into guys.
- Guys?

311
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,630
Coming through!

312
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,750
<i>That was the closest</i>
<i>we ever got...</i>

313
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,840
<i>just 0.01 cm between us.</i>

314
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,330
<i>I knew nothing about her.</i>

315
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,000
<i>Six hours later,</i>

316
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,330
<i>she fell in love</i>
<i>with another man.</i>

317
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,880
Chef's salad, please.

318
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,160
For here or to go?

319
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,750
To go.

320
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,960
You new here?
I haven't seen you before.

321
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,500
You like listening
to loud music?

322
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,840
Yes. The louder the better.

323
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,370
Keeps me from thinking so much.

324
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,540
You don't like to think?

325
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,580
What do you like?

326
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,540
I'll tell you when I find out.

327
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,840
And what do you like?

328
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,460
Chef's salad.

329
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,120
A chef's salad, boss.

330
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,120
Chef's salad again?

331
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,210
Aren't you tired of them yet?

332
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,460
- It's not for me.
- Your girlfriend?

333
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,500
Is that her favorite?

334
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,290
She never said it wasn't.

335
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,670
Maybe she'd like
something different for once.

336
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,120
Try fish and chips.
It's delicious.

337
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,330
What if she doesn't like it?

338
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,710
Get both and let her choose.

339
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,960
You can't go wrong.

340
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,840
- Isn't that wasting money?
- It's not that much.

341
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,540
It's good to give her a choice.

342
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,250
Okay. One chef's salad,
one fish and chips.

343
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:42,880
All right!

344
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,840
Thanks.

345
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,880
Fish and chips, please, boss.

346
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,540
See?

347
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,880
I told you she'd like it.

348
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,670
You were right.

349
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:43,330
She never told me
she didn't like chef's salad.

350
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,080
You never...

351
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,250
You never gave her a choice.

352
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,540
If you had,
she might have told you.

353
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,750
Anyway, now you broke the routine.
Try pizza tonight.

354
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,080
I don't know
if she'd like pizza.

355
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,920
Then do the same thing:
Get both.

356
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,670
It won't break the bank.

357
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,420
Okay.

358
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,710
Want to try
something different again?

359
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,630
The hot dogs are good.

360
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,250
No, thanks. Just black coffee.

361
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,080
Nothing for your girlfriend?

362
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,790
She left.

363
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,460
Why?

364
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,960
Said she wanted
to try some new dishes.

365
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,210
I guess she's right.

366
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:44,710
Plenty of choice in men,
just like food.

367
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,790
I guess I should've stuck
with the chef's salad.

368
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:54,880
It's no big deal.

369
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,880
She'll try someone else
and see you're better.

370
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,210
She'll come running back.
Don't worry.

371
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,750
Thanks.

372
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,670
<i>On every flight, there's one stewardess</i>
<i>you long to seduce.</i>

373
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:34,000
<i>This time last year,</i>
<i>at 25,000 feet,</i>

374
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,000
<i>I actually seduced one.</i>

375
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,000
<i>I thought we'd stay together</i>
<i>for the long haul,</i>

376
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,370
<i>flying like a jumbo jet</i>
<i>on a full tank.</i>

377
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,920
<i>But there was an unexpected</i>
<i>change of course.</i>

378
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,540
<i>Black coffee, please.</i>

379
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:48,250
<i>A week and she's not back?</i>

380
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:50,040
Excuse me.

381
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,880
Maybe she does have
lots of choices.

382
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,460
Then put her out of your mind.

383
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,710
You have plenty of choices too.

384
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,000
Black coffee every night's
no good for you.

385
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,750
Can't change just like that.
Have to go slow.

386
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:10,840
Don't worry. I'll be okay.

387
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,210
If you say so.

388
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,630
Excuse me. The policeman who buys
a chef's salad here every night...

389
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,460
You mean No. 633?

390
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,750
He's off today.

391
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,120
Isn't he off on Saturdays?

392
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,750
He changed shifts.
Didn't he tell you?

393
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:22,290
If you see him again,
could you please give him this?

394
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,080
Sure, no problem.

395
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:27,290
Thank you.

396
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,370
I have to step out.

397
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,750
I have some things
to take care of.

398
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,880
We're taking a break.

399
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,750
- Where are you going?
- I have to go out too.

400
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:59,120
You here alone tonight?

401
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:02,160
Everyone was here a minute ago.

402
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:06,040
They ran off
just as you walked up.

403
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,290
Something wrong with me?

404
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,630
No.

405
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,920
- Black coffee.
- Thanks.

406
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:21,420
Last night...

407
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,960
some girl...

408
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,120
What?

409
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,840
Last night some girl...

410
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,040
Can you turn that music
down a bit?

411
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:48,080
A girl waited around
a long time for you last night.

412
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,630
She left a letter for you.

413
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,960
Really?

414
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,160
A stewardess.

415
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:03,790
- You wanna read it?
- After my coffee.

416
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,790
Hey, your letter!

417
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,920
Keep it for me.
I'll get it next time.

418
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,420
Hey, boss.

419
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,250
What are you doing here?

420
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,370
I'm on duty.

421
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,920
- Where's No. 633?
- He's on leave.

422
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,370
On leave?

423
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,750
Said he got hurt by a pin.
He's recuperating at home.

424
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,370
Hurt by a pin?
What's he talking about?

425
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,920
<i>Ever since she left,</i>
<i>everything in the apartment is sad.</i>

426
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,330
<i>I have to comfort them all</i>
<i>before I go to sleep.</i>

427
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,880
<i>You've lost a lot of weight,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

428
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,670
You were so chubby before.

429
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,250
Now look at yourself.
You're so skinny.

430
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:48,210
Have more confidence
in yourself.

431
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:57,960
I told you to stop crying.
How long are you going to cry?

432
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,290
You have to be strong.

433
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,790
You're so limp and shapeless.
Look at you.

434
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,630
I'll help you.

435
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,460
There. Isn't that more comfy?

436
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,000
Why don't you say something?

437
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,160
Don't be mad at her.

438
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:31,160
We all have moments of doubt.

439
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,160
Give her a chance.

440
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:37,160
Okay?

441
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,460
<i>Feeling lonely?</i>

442
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,250
<i>You're a real mess.</i>

443
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,880
<i>You cold? I'll warm you up.</i>

444
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,500
- Hello.
- How are you?

445
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:59,750
It's all ready. Need any help?

446
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,500
It's not much. I'll manage.

447
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,580
Excuse me.

448
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,580
Pardon me.

449
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,080
- Hello.
- Oh, it's you.

450
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,370
Are you better?

451
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,750
Better?

452
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:22,500
He said you got hurt by a pin.

453
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,670
Don't listen to his nonsense.

454
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:30,210
You haven't been
around much lately.

455
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,580
I changed shifts.
I'm on this beat now.

456
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,880
Really?

457
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,370
- Want some help?
- Sure.

458
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,540
See you later.

459
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,080
It's so heavy!

460
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,290
It's light today.

461
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,290
Your job must be hard.

462
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:57,210
Work's never fun.

463
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,080
Why'd you take this job?

464
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:03,330
My cousin couldn't find
anyone else.

465
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,250
I'm just helping out for now.

466
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,580
What did you do before?

467
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,920
Lots of things.

468
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,080
I'm saving up.

469
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,920
To go to school?

470
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,420
Never thought of that.

471
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,540
I just want to enjoy life.

472
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,460
How? Where?

473
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:24,370
Anywhere.

474
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,080
Maybe California.

475
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,790
California? Is it fun there?

476
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:36,120
I said maybe.
If it's not, I can move on.

477
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:39,120
You like to travel?

478
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:41,880
Don't you?

479
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,080
I can take it or leave it.

480
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:52,460
You can come with me.
I almost have enough.

481
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:55,120
We'll see.

482
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,290
Are you always like this?

483
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,290
You never came to get
that letter.

484
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,330
I've been busy.

485
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,630
Give me your address.
I'll mail it.

486
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,080
Otherwise it'll get lost.

487
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,160
Okay.

488
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,750
You live close by.

489
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,540
Yeah, right down there.
Drop by sometime.

490
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,330
I will.

491
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,630
Well, let's keep going.

492
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,160
You're really sweating.

493
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:58,080
Sure you can manage?

494
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,160
I'm fine.

495
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,420
<i>Stop daydreaming, will you?</i>

496
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,750
<i>Think you're a rock star?</i>

497
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,840
You've been fooling around
with that all day.

498
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,080
Who'd wanna eat it now?

499
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:08,500
Use a toilet roll or something.

500
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,670
You too!

501
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,460
I'm not daydreaming.

502
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,670
That's right.
You're sleepwalking!

503
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:28,120
That's right. I'm sleepwalking.

504
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,250
Whatever you say.

505
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:34,460
I'm sleepwalking.

506
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:38,630
<i>I had a dream that afternoon.</i>

507
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,920
<i>It seemed I was</i>
<i>in his apartment</i>

508
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,420
<i>and that I'd wake up</i>
<i>when I left.</i>

509
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,920
<i>I didn't know you never wake up</i>
<i>from some dreams.</i>

510
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,880
<i>Some days I go home for lunch,</i>

511
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,580
<i>because there's always</i>
<i>a chance...</i>

512
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,960
I know you're in there.

513
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,160
Come on out.

514
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,960
I'll count to three.

515
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,580
One...

516
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,500
two...

517
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:16,670
three!

518
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:20,160
<i>She used to jump out</i>
<i>and scare me,</i>

519
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,840
<i>but she hasn't done it</i>
<i>much recently.</i>

520
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,160
<i>I guess games get old</i>
<i>after a while.</i>

521
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,750
<i>Maybe she's hiding</i>
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

522
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,120
Hello.

523
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,250
Hello!

524
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:01,580
Dummy.

525
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,580
- Roast pork and rice.
- Thanks.

526
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:09,000
Excuse me.

527
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,250
Hi.

528
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,580
- Eating here again, huh?
- Yes.

529
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,790
Will you be here a while?

530
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,790
Why?

531
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,080
No reason.

532
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:31,880
Where are you going?

533
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,750
I forgot something.

534
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:38,960
Oh, I still haven't
mailed your letter.

535
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,710
No hurry.

536
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,920
All right.
I'll get around to it.

537
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:52,420
Why are you back?

538
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:56,160
I have to pay the electricity bill.
Can I leave this here?

539
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:03,250
Hello? Cousin?

540
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:05,840
I'm still at the market.

541
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,920
It's pouring rain here.

542
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,840
It's pouring. Listen.

543
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,460
What are you talking about?
It's sunny over here.

544
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:21,160
Really? Must be a local shower.

545
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:23,290
I'll be back when it stops.

546
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:24,920
Don't forget
the electricity bill.

547
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,710
I won't.

548
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,000
I'm going now.

549
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,080
It's okay.

550
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:18,500
I'll be back to see you soon.

551
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,750
These are for you.

552
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,330
Why all the lychees?

553
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,580
They're for a friend.

554
01:09:57,370 --> 01:09:58,920
<i>Where are you?</i>

555
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,080
Paying the electricity bill.

556
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:03,000
<i>All this time?</i>

557
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,460
It's packed here.
I can hardly get in the store.

558
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:08,120
I have to wait in line.

559
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:12,160
How come it's always so crowded?
You've been trying for days.

560
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,630
I don't want to.

561
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:22,540
I'm doing my best.
Should I try again tomorrow?

562
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:25,460
Try another store.

563
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,960
Another store?

564
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,040
Okay. You're sure?

565
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,580
Hi.

566
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,880
Been shopping?

567
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:41,840
A friend is redecorating
his place.

568
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,210
- You sure are busy.
- I certainly am.

569
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:50,540
Black coffee again.
It's bad for you.

570
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:53,880
If you can't sleep at night,
drink water.

571
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:31,370
<i>Man in my dreams</i>

572
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:34,960
<i>I hold you tight for a minute</i>

573
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:38,630
<i>And kiss you for hours</i>

574
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,420
<i>Stranger</i>

575
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:50,250
<i>You stole into my heart</i>

576
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:54,040
<i>And set it all awhirl</i>

577
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,630
<i>I've been in love</i>
<i>with you before</i>

578
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:03,920
<i>But never felt so close</i>
<i>to you as now</i>

579
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:08,460
<i>My thoughts careen</i>
<i>out of control</i>

580
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,790
<i>Why have you taken me by storm</i>

581
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,630
<i>Bursting into my dreary dreams</i>

582
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,750
<i>Sending shock waves</i>
<i>in every direction</i>

583
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:47,040
<i>Man in my dreams</i>

584
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,710
<i>I want you to be real</i>

585
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,790
<i>My heart can no longer resist</i>

586
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:02,500
<i>Searching in my dreams</i>

587
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:05,210
<i>At this minute I'm waiting</i>

588
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,540
<i>To kiss you for hours</i>

589
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:18,160
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

590
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:21,630
<i>The plane's back in Hong Kong.</i>
<i>Want to make a reservation?</i>

591
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,840
<i>I'm at the same number. Call me.</i>
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

592
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,160
Nice hair!
Did it take long to grow?

593
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:22,420
None of your business.

594
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,670
Kind of a flirt, isn't she?

595
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:29,330
I guess so.

596
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,790
What is it?

597
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:37,630
Have you known her long?

598
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:39,250
No.

599
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:50,630
<i>One day I had this sudden</i>
<i>feeling she was back.</i>

600
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,040
<i>Did I leave the faucet running,</i>

601
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:30,080
<i>or is the apartment</i>
<i>getting more weepy?</i>

602
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,750
<i>I thought it would cope all right.</i>

603
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,880
<i>I didn't expect it</i>
<i>to weep this much.</i>

604
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:39,080
<i>When people cry,</i>
<i>you just give them a tissue.</i>

605
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:43,160
<i>But when an apartment cries,</i>
<i>it's a lot of work to mop it up.</i>

606
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:04,580
What are you doing here?

607
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:07,500
- I live here.
- You live here?

608
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:09,630
What are you doing here?

609
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,920
I came to buy goldfish.

610
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:15,420
- Someone around here sell goldfish?
- No.

611
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:18,790
Then why come to buy goldfish?
You buying or selling?

612
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,920
What? No... I mean, I'm buying.

613
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:26,250
Stop it! I forget everything
when I'm scared.

614
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:27,630
Why are you scared?

615
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:30,920
I got scared
when I saw you here.

616
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,670
I'm going now.

617
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:40,420
You said you were going. Well?

618
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,840
I can't move my legs.
I'd go if I could.

619
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,630
You have a cramp?

620
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,750
I don't know.
It's never happened before.

621
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,630
Maybe you should come in
and sit down.

622
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:06,460
<i>When she'd return from a long flight,</i>
<i>I'd massage her legs.</i>

623
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:09,000
<i>Being a stewardess</i>
<i>is a tough job.</i>

624
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:11,840
<i>I've always found</i>
<i>women's legs sexy.</i>

625
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,840
<i>But I haven't touched any</i>
<i>since she left.</i>

626
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,160
- Better?
- I guess.

627
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:28,500
- Can I go now?
- Stay a while longer.

628
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,580
I'll put on some music.

629
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,540
You like this song too?

630
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:58,790
Not really.
My girlfriend liked it.

631
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:04,960
She really liked this song?

632
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,210
Yes.

633
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,750
<i>I know it isn't true.</i>

634
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:22,580
<i>That's my CD.</i>
<i>I left it here a few days ago.</i>

635
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:27,750
<i>I'm starting to wonder:</i>
<i>Can sleepwalking be contagious?</i>

636
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,250
<i>I guess I've been too nervous.</i>

637
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:32,840
<i>After a while, I fell asleep.</i>

638
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:58,790
<i>The girl fell asleep</i>
<i>in my place that afternoon.</i>

639
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:02,000
<i>I thought about waking her up,</i>

640
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,290
<i>but for some reason I didn't.</i>

641
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:37,750
Oh, no!

642
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,880
Watch out for the flames.

643
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,160
Make sure
those candles are secure.

644
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,750
Don't burn yourself.

645
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,080
What's gotten into you lately?

646
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:58,670
Why didn't you pay
the electricity bill?

647
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:01,000
Where have you been
going every day?

648
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,750
I went to see the doctor.

649
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,420
The doctor? I haven't seen you
taking any medicine.

650
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:10,290
You just didn't notice.

651
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:14,670
Did he say
when you'd get better?

652
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,630
Should be any day now.

653
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:25,290
You're crazy!

654
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,840
<i>Maybe it's the change of season,</i>

655
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,250
<i>but lately I've changed a lot.</i>

656
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:45,670
<i>I've become more observant.</i>

657
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:48,540
<i>I notice things</i>
<i>I used to take for granted.</i>

658
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:54,880
<i>Even the sardines taste different.</i>

659
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,500
You mustn't let yourself go.

660
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:57,500
You were fine before.
Now you've suddenly put on weight.

661
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:03,120
She left,
but you have to carry on.

662
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:07,500
You can't go on
indulging yourself.

663
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,250
You know, I have to tell you:

664
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:12,880
You've totally changed.

665
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,840
You can't just
change personality like this.

666
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:20,000
Her walking out is no excuse.

667
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,330
I want you to think about that.

668
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,040
<i>It was a relief</i>
<i>when I saw it crying.</i>

669
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:36,000
<i>It may look different</i>
<i>on the outside,</i>

670
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,960
<i>but it's still true to itself.</i>

671
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,880
<i>It's still</i>
<i>a very emotional towel.</i>

672
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,370
Have you noticed
I've perked up?

673
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,500
Things are starting
to look better.

674
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:49,460
You used to look sorta dumb,

675
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:52,840
but now you're looking
quite cute.

676
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:56,160
But you mustn't
let yourself get so dirty.

677
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:59,000
You used to be
so clean and white.

678
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:01,920
Now you've turned all yellow.

679
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:05,000
Look at these scars.

680
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:10,000
Have you been
getting in fights?

681
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,840
Why were you hiding in there?

682
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,370
I've been looking
all over for you.

683
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,790
What's the point of hiding?

684
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,460
You have to face reality.

685
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:32,540
You're all moldy.

686
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:36,920
Tell you what.
I'm not busy tomorrow.

687
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:39,370
I'll take you out for some sun.

688
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:27,330
What are you doing
in my apartment?

689
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,750
You said to drop by!

690
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:36,210
Open up
or I'll break the door down!

691
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,750
There's someone
looking for you.

692
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,540
- Me?
- Yeah.

693
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:20,460
- What do you want?
- I've come for my letter.

694
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:22,710
What letter? Ask the boss.

695
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:26,160
You were keeping it.

696
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:28,080
He said you had it.

697
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:29,500
I do?

698
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,120
I have it?

699
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:34,920
Oh, right.

700
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:42,160
I was afraid someone might take it.
I didn't read it.

701
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,000
Thanks.

702
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:52,880
Are you free tomorrow night?

703
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,040
Why do you ask?

704
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,540
- I want to ask you out.
- On a date?

705
01:26:57,670 --> 01:27:00,120
The boss says
you're off tomorrow.

706
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:04,040
So I have to go on a date?

707
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,040
Think it over.

708
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:11,000
I'll meet you across the street
at the California at 8:00.

709
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:15,960
That music's not your style.

710
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,920
Here's your CD back.

711
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,540
Damn it!

712
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,580
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

713
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,750
No. 633 is a smooth operator.

714
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:45,880
- It's 663.
- Whatever it is!

715
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:54,080
Wait!

716
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,540
- Where's my Coke?
- I'm out of cups!

717
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:21,670
<i>I gave my place</i>
<i>a thorough cleaning that afternoon.</i>

718
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:25,710
<i>It was like clearing the runway</i>
<i>for another plane to land.</i>

719
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,500
<i>I got to the California</i>
<i>really early that night.</i>

720
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:09,840
<i>I half expected a flight delay,</i>

721
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,290
<i>so I got some loose change.</i>

722
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:25,710
Change, please.

723
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:48,080
<i>Half an hour later,</i>
<i>I broke another $10 bill.</i>

724
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,960
<i>I started thinking</i>
<i>maybe the flight was canceled.</i>

725
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:17,210
She isn't coming.

726
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:20,120
She asked me to give you this.

727
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:24,750
Don't look so down.

728
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,080
She didn't work out,
so try another girl.

729
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:32,040
May's coming back tomorrow.
Give her a try.

730
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,580
- Where is she?
- She quit.

731
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:37,960
Said she was going
to California.

732
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,420
That's all.

733
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:42,210
Thanks.

734
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,210
<i>I didn't read the letter.</i>

735
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,790
<i>Some things take time</i>
<i>to sink in.</i>

736
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,670
<i>After the snack-bar manager left,</i>

737
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:58,160
<i>I started talking</i>
<i>to the beer bottles.</i>

738
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:00,540
<i>Disappointed?</i>

739
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,880
<i>Not really.</i>

740
01:31:03,370 --> 01:31:07,120
<i>Go home to bed.</i>
<i>She's not coming.</i>

741
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,960
<i>Actually, she wasn't</i>
<i>a no-show that night.</i>

742
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,290
<i>She just got the place wrong.</i>

743
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,120
<i>We were</i>
<i>in different Californias</i>

744
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:28,420
<i>15 hours apart.</i>

745
01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:32,920
<i>It must be 11:00 a.m.</i>
<i>over there now.</i>

746
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:37,630
<i>I wonder if she'll remember</i>
<i>our 8:00 p.m. date here.</i>

747
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,210
What a coincidence!

748
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,840
Not on duty tonight?

749
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,670
That's right.

750
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:05,920
How are you?

751
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:08,330
Fine. And you?

752
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:10,040
I'm okay.

753
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,960
You alone?

754
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,160
No, I'm with a friend.

755
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,840
He's your type.

756
01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:23,250
You still have stuff
at my place.

757
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:25,040
Come get it sometime.

758
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:28,540
That's all right.
Just throw it out.

759
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:32,790
All right.

760
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,290
I gotta go.

761
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,960
I still think
you look better in uniform.

762
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,420
So do you.

763
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:51,250
Hey, you didn't pay.

764
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:52,710
You pay for me.

765
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
How much is it?

766
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:12,580
<i>The letter turned out to be</i>
<i>a boarding pass dated for one year later,</i>

767
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,540
<i>but I couldn't make out</i>

768
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:17,330
<i>the destination.</i>

769
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:31,960
<i>I actually did show up</i>
<i>that evening.</i>

770
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,710
<i>I knew it would get crowded,</i>
<i>so I got there at 7:15.</i>

771
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,920
<i>It was pouring outside.</i>

772
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:43,460
<i>Watching through the window,</i>
<i>I saw a rainy California.</i>

773
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:48,250
<i>I needed to know if the other</i>
<i>California was warm and sunny.</i>

774
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,880
<i>I decided to give myself</i>
<i>one year.</i>

775
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:56,330
<i>Tonight it's raining</i>
<i>as hard as it was then.</i>

776
01:35:56,710 --> 01:35:58,630
<i>Looking out this window,</i>

777
01:35:58,750 --> 01:36:01,210
<i>there's just one person</i>
<i>in my thoughts.</i>

778
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:05,250
<i>I wonder if he ever</i>
<i>opened my letter.</i>

779
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:03,080
What are you doing here?

780
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,420
Hey!

781
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:09,670
What are you doing here?

782
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:11,630
Is that really you?

783
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:14,750
Yeah. What are you doing here?

784
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,120
Renovating.

785
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:18,210
Renovating?

786
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,790
Where's my cousin?

787
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,710
He opened a karaoke bar.

788
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:27,790
Said he needed a change.

789
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,040
He let me take over here.
Didn't he tell you?

790
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:34,500
No, I haven't seen him.

791
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:37,120
He's a shrewd businessman.

792
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:40,670
First he sells me
fish and chips,

793
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:42,330
and then the whole shop.

794
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,920
What?

795
01:37:44,370 --> 01:37:47,160
I said your cousin
is a shrewd businessman!

796
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:55,330
Since when do you like
this loud music?

797
01:37:57,370 --> 01:38:00,250
With a little time,
I get used to things.

798
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:10,040
Did you go to California?
Was it fun?

799
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:19,710
California...

800
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,540
was okay. Nothing special.

801
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:32,000
You look good in uniform.

802
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,420
You look nice like that too.

803
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:37,540
Want something to eat?

804
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:39,420
I better not.

805
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:43,160
I fly out real early tomorrow.

806
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:47,500
When will you be back?

807
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,460
My grand opening
is in two days.

808
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:53,840
I don't know.

809
01:38:54,290 --> 01:38:57,290
This might be a long trip.

810
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:03,120
Write to me when you reach
wherever it is.

811
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,250
You probably
wouldn't read it anyway.

812
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:13,210
I have to ask you something.

813
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:25,880
Would you let someone board

814
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,080
with a boarding pass like this?

815
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:35,880
It's dated today,
but it got blurred in the rain.

816
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,460
I can't tell

817
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:41,460
where it's taking me.
Do you know?

818
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:44,880
No...

819
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:48,710
but I'll give you another one.

820
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:54,120
Great.

821
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,540
Where do you want to go?

822
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:11,540
Doesn't matter.
Wherever you want to take me.
