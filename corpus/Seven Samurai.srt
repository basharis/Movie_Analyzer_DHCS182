17
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:55,507
In the 16th century, during the Civil Wars,

18
00:02:55,716 --> 00:03:00,346
an endless cycle of conflict
left the countryside overrun by bandits.

19
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:04,641
Peaceful peasants lived in terror
of the thunder of approaching hooves...

20
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:51,772
Take this village too?

21
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,650
Take it! Take it!

22
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:56,985
Not so fast!

23
00:03:57,152 --> 00:04:01,115
We just took their rice last fall.

24
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:03,242
They'll have nothing now.

25
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:05,202
Very well.

26
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,205
We'll return
when that barley's ripe!

27
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:43,490
Is there no god to protect us?

28
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:50,914
Land tax, forced labor,
war, drought...

29
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:54,293
and now bandits!

30
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:02,384
The gods want us farmers dead!

31
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,304
That's right!
We're better off dead!

32
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,226
What's all this?
Crying won't change anything.

33
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,563
The magistrate can do more
than collect taxes.

34
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,565
We can ask him for help.

35
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,526
We know all about him!

36
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:23,072
He shows up after they're gone,
acting big while he surveys the damage.

37
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:25,366
That's right. He's useless.

38
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:30,871
We might as well hand over
our rice and barley to the bandits

39
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,332
and just hang ourselves!

40
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:37,252
That'll bring the magistrate
here in a hurry!

41
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,556
We'll kill those bandits.

42
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,559
We'll kill them all.

43
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,812
Never again!
Let's kill 'em all!

44
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,064
Not me!

45
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:00,943
I couldn't possibly --

46
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,030
That's crazy talk.

47
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,244
So we can kill defeated samurai
but not bandits?

48
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:14,248
Stop it! This is no time
to fight amongst ourselves.

49
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:21,422
We don't have a chance against bandits.
And when we lose?

50
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,967
They'll slaughter us all,
down to the last unborn child.

51
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,595
I've had enough!
Better to risk it all

52
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:31,432
than to live like this.
Kill or be killed!

53
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,100
Rikichi!

54
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:36,270
The farmer's only choice
is to endure.

55
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,605
We can't defy the powerful.

56
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:43,152
When the bandits arrive,
we'll greet them meekly

57
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,155
and quietly hand over
all our barley.

58
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:51,201
We'll plead with them to leave
just enough for us to survive.

59
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,790
"That's all we ask,"
we'll beg on our hands and knees.

60
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,711
What bandit will agree to that?

61
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:06,258
Have you forgotten how low we had
to stoop for the rice we're eating now?

62
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:29,782
We should go see the Old Man.

63
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,368
Let him decide what to do.

64
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,144
<i>Consider who
we're dealing with here. </i>

65
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,774
<i>Give a wolf a taste of your leg
and he'll ask for your hand. </i>

66
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:48,736
<i>Once they have a taste,
they'll be back in the fall. </i>

67
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,239
<i>- But what if we lose?
- Then we're no worse off!</i>

68
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,784
<i>Without our barley,
we're doomed anyway!</i>

69
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:02,166
We fight.

70
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,086
Old Man, that's madness.

71
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,756
We're farmers.
What do we know of battle?

72
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:11,467
We'll hire samurai.

73
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,971
Whoever heard of farmers
hiring samurai?

74
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,309
I saw it with my own eyes,

75
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:26,565
when the village you were born in
was torched.

76
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:31,779
I saw it when we escaped
to this village here.

77
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:39,870
The only village that didn't burn
was the one that hired samurai.

78
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:43,874
But Old Man, there are
different kinds of villages and villagers.

79
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,585
How are we to feed samurai
when we live on rice gruel?

80
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,961
We'll make do on millet!

81
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,508
Show me a samurai who'll fight
for farmers in return for food!

82
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,677
They're a proud lot.

83
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,928
Look.

84
00:09:57,137 --> 00:10:00,849
Find hungry samurai.

85
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:07,856
Even bears come down from
the mountains when they're hungry.

86
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,111
How dare you?

87
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:59,033
You're nothing but a farmer!
I'm still a samurai!

88
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,035
I don't need your charity!

89
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,748
Fool!

90
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:14,673
What'd I tell you?

91
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,708
Look, the barley's ripe.

92
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,878
Ten days already
since we left the village.

93
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,464
What do we do?

94
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,011
This barley's early,
not like our mountain barley.

95
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,434
Hey, we're soaked through
to the bone.

96
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,271
Find any cheap, strong
and foolhardy samurai?

97
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,312
Leftovers.

98
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,939
You can have 'em cheap.

99
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,399
That's a laugh!

100
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,986
- What's so funny?
- He's blind.

101
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,906
- What about you, then?
- Not me.

102
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,451
I'd rather eat horseshit.

103
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:14,001
- Won't get a nose bleed outta him.
- Cleaned him out gambling last night.

104
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:18,047
Pulled his sword when he lost,
so the three of us beat him up.

105
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,632
Not a drop left in his nose now.

106
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,973
Don't bother.
They only eat millet.

107
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:31,226
Is that true?
You can't live like that.

108
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,355
Without nourishment
you'll go night-blind.

109
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:36,440
I've got just four left.

110
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:39,276
I'll trade 'em all
for a cup of rice.

111
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,445
What do you say?

112
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,825
Damn! What a bunch.

113
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,097
What a waste.

114
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:13,268
If we still had that rice,
we coulda bought 40 of those.

115
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,353
Shut up!

116
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,398
But it's true, right?

117
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,485
The blockhead's cracking up!

118
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,446
What a show.
Go at it, boys.

119
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,998
Who ever heard
of anything so unfair?

120
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:41,422
We give him his fill of rice
and a free bottle of sake,

121
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:45,592
and he thanks us
with a beating.

122
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,096
Good for him!

123
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,266
Not like this one
playing possum here.

124
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:57,813
Say, let's go home.
Let's just go home.

125
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,358
Look at him sobbing.

126
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,235
Misses his wifey.

127
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,488
I'd pay good money
to watch the two of 'em going at it.

128
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:11,285
Let's hurry
and get back to the village.

129
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,955
Go on home. You can't afford buns,
let alone samurai.

130
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:20,002
Farmers like us know
good from bad when it comes to seed,

131
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,005
but not when it comes
to samurai.

132
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:29,011
Besides, we're no match
for the tough ones,

133
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:35,642
and the only ones interested
are weaklings.

134
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,530
If I lost last night,
it was only because I was starving.

135
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,494
Liar! You had plenty
of money to gamble.

136
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,871
Jerk!

137
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,581
Wanna fight?

138
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,751
It's a fight.

139
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,548
Over here!
Wake up!

140
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,728
Quit that strumming, monk!
It's depressing!

141
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,732
Keep it up, grandpa.
We're on your side.

142
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,390
Rikichi!

143
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,809
Stop it, Manzo!

144
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,229
You said we were going home,
you son of a bitch!

145
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,150
I said we'd go home,
not bargain with bandits!

146
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,486
If we can't hire samurai,
what's left?

147
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,322
It's bargain or nothing!

148
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,909
Fine, have it your way!

149
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,086
But tell me:

150
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,340
If we do strike a bargain,

151
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,759
what have we got
to offer this year?

152
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,762
Are you willing to give 'em
your daughter?

153
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,682
Shino's a fine-lookin' girl.

154
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,401
What's going on?

155
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:17,531
There's a thief in that barn.
We raised a ruckus and he ran in to hide.

156
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,056
How many thieves are there?

157
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,307
Just one.

158
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,184
One?

159
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,438
All of you can't take
a single thief?

160
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:54,485
We don't dare make a move.
He took a kid in there with him.

161
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,446
Says he'll kill him
if we attack.

162
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,200
Listen. Hear him?

163
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,666
Poor thing.

164
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,001
It all happened
in the middle of the night.

165
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,464
Poor kid's been bawling
the better part of a day.

166
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,801
He can barely
make a sound now.

167
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:26,141
He's only seven.
Imagine how his parents feel.

168
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,062
Who's that samurai
getting his head shaved?

169
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,608
No idea. We asked him for help
and he agreed right away.

170
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,777
Then he asked us
for two rice balls.

171
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:41,198
He asked a monk to shave his head
and lend him his robes.

172
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,950
No idea what he's up to.

173
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,713
<i>Stay back!
Any closer and I kill the brat!</i>

174
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm a monk.

175
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,176
<i>Stay back!</i>

176
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,556
I'm just a monk.
I mean you no harm.

177
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,355
I won't come in.

178
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:40,651
I just thought the child
must be very hungry.

179
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,242
I've brought some rice balls.

180
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,245
You should eat one yourself.

181
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,334
Won't you have one?

182
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,669
What's wrong?

183
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,591
<i>Throw 'em here!</i>

184
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,427
Here.

185
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,373
My baby!

186
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,572
Even you can't object
to a samurai like that.

187
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,534
Ask him quickly.
It'll be harder in town.

188
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,677
What do you want?

189
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:24,398
My name is Katsushiro Okamoto.
Please make me your disciple!

190
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,402
Disciple?

191
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,448
As you see, I'm a ronin.
The name is Kambei Shimada.

192
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,326
I don't take on disciples.

193
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,203
Get up.
I can't talk to you like this.

194
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,623
I'm begging you --
let me be your disciple.

195
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:46,670
First get off your knees.
We'll talk as we go.

196
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,726
I'm at a loss.

197
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,937
You think far too highly of me.

198
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:04,897
No, sir --

199
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,815
Just hear me out.

200
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:10,152
There's nothing special
about me.

201
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:13,614
I may have seen
my share of battle,

202
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,784
but always on the losing side.

203
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,745
That about sums me up.

204
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,956
Better not to follow
such an unlucky man.

205
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:28,128
No, I'm determined to follow you
whether you allow me to or not.

206
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,963
I forbid it.

207
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,009
I don't have the means
to travel with an attendant.

208
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,981
Can I help you?

209
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,908
What do you want?

210
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,126
Insolence!

211
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,088
Stay out of this, little chick.

212
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,218
Are you a samurai?

213
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,057
Damn right I am!

214
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,812
I wonder.

215
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,030
Bastard.

216
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,922
Who was that?

217
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,847
Leave him be.

218
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,034
I beg of you, sir!

219
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,081
You idiot.
Why don't you scram?

220
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:33,212
Stubborn old fool.
They'll eat it and run like last time.

221
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,678
It will never work.

222
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:44,348
Sir, we could arm the villagers
with bamboo spears.

223
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,142
- I thought of that.
- But, sir --

224
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,232
This isn't a game.

225
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,279
They may be bandits,
but they ride 40 strong.

226
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:03,158
Two or three samurai
won't suffice.

227
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:20,009
Defense is more difficult
than offense.

228
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:24,263
You say there are mountains
behind the village?

229
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,264
Yes.

230
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,141
Passable by horse?

231
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,350
Yes.

232
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,820
Fields in front.

233
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,489
Until those are flooded
with water,

234
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:45,909
you're open to mounted attack
on four sides.

235
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,080
You need at least four men,
one to guard each side.

236
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,209
Two more to guard the rear.

237
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,547
No matter how frugal
our estimate,

238
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,759
we need seven,
including me.

239
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,263
We can manage
seven somehow.

240
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,183
But the Old Man said four.

241
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,018
It's only three more.

242
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,103
Hold on a second.

243
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:17,024
I haven't accepted your offer.
I'm only speculating.

244
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:22,905
First of all, it's not easy
to find trustworthy samurai.

245
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:28,285
What's more,
all you have to offer is food.

246
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:33,082
Only those out to fight
for the hell of it will agree.

247
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:37,795
Besides, I'm sick of fighting.

248
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,923
Age, I suppose.

249
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,364
Good thing
I wasn't born a peasant.

250
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:10,619
Better to be born a dog.
Goddamn it.

251
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:14,873
Go ahead -- hang yourself and die!
You're better off dead!

252
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,458
Silence, you lout!

253
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,253
What's it to you?
I'm only telling the truth.

254
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,716
What truth? What the hell do you know
of these farmers' suffering?

255
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,509
Don't make me laugh!

256
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,386
Like you would know.

257
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,429
How dare you?

258
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,016
You heard right. If you know,
why don't you help them?

259
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,148
So you wanna fight?

260
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,943
That's enough.

261
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,118
Enough!

262
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:01,712
Hey, samurai, look at this.

263
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,756
This here's your dinner.

264
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,592
But what do you think
these blockheads eat?

265
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,052
Millet.

266
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:12,306
They eat millet
to feed you white rice.

267
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:16,018
This is the best they can offer.
What do you say to that?

268
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,730
- All right, then.
- What?

269
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,357
Quit your jabbering.

270
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,448
I won't let this rice go to waste.

271
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,509
Manzo and the others are back!

272
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,692
Where are Rikichi and Yohei?

273
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,569
They stayed behind.
We still need more samurai.

274
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,029
The samurai are coming?

275
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,281
They sure are.
Seven of 'em.

276
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,700
Seven?

277
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,247
Seven.

278
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:23,043
I was against it
because you said four, Old Man.

279
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:29,883
I figured we'd need
at least ten.

280
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:35,180
But if I'd said ten,
we'd have ended up with 15.

281
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,726
That's the way it goes.

282
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:43,272
Old Man, I'm worried.

283
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:51,572
The village girls will go crazy
over the samurai.

284
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,951
If the samurai touch 'em,
all hell will break loose.

285
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:02,458
Bandits are coming, you fool.

286
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,086
Your head is on the block,

287
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:09,715
and all you think of
are your whiskers?

288
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,517
Samurai, sir.

289
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:34,990
- You require my services?
- Yes, sir.

290
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,201
Who's to be my opponent?

291
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,120
<i>Katsushiro. </i>

292
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:53,967
Hide just inside the door.

293
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,889
Strike that ronin as he enters.

294
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,396
Here he comes.

295
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:13,237
Don't hold back.
Give him a real whack.

296
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,851
Excellent!

297
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,856
Please don't take offense.
I am Kambei Shimada.

298
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:53,527
We're seeking expert swordsmen
and have no time to waste.

299
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:55,029
Forgive me.

300
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:56,947
What's this about?

301
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,950
The reason better be good,
or I'll have to redeem my honor.

302
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,621
I humbly beg your pardon.
We only sought to test your skill.

303
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,125
We must soon contend
with a gang of bandits.

304
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:11,962
I see.
And whose clan do you serve?

305
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:17,551
It pains me to tell you,
but we're fighting for farmers.

306
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,261
- Farmers?
- That's right.

307
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,890
This job affords
no stipend and no reward.

308
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,144
But we can eat our fill
as long as we fight.

309
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:28,812
This is absurd!

310
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,940
My ambitions
are greater than that.

311
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:37,905
That's a shame.
Won't you reconsider?

312
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,157
I will not.

313
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:51,543
Sir, we lost a good man there.
Such a fine swordsman.

314
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,299
What's wrong?

315
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:43,887
That one samurai's good,
but how'll the other six be?

316
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,181
Enough of your worrying.

317
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,978
How can we know before they get here?
Don't worry till you've seen 'em.

318
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,203
<i>That one there. </i>

319
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,891
Excuse me, samurai, sir.

320
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,936
Just like last time?

321
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:39,360
Sure.
It's good practice for you.

322
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,435
Surely you jest.

323
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,063
No offense intended.

324
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,830
I'm with you.

325
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,501
But I have to say

326
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,754
that although I understand
the farmers' suffering

327
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,634
and understand
why you would take up their cause,

328
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:50,723
it's your character
that I find most compelling.

329
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,270
In life one finds friends
in the strangest places.

330
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:04,862
- What is your name?
- Gorobei Katayama.

331
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,031
A name fit for a giant, no?

332
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:21,503
Yohei, what are you doing?
Hurry and wash the rice.

333
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,468
Yohei!

334
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:32,556
What's wrong?

335
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:37,311
Someone stole the rice.

336
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,659
You idiot!
Didn't I warn you?

337
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,620
I was so careful.

338
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:03,837
I slept the whole night
hugging that rice jar.

339
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,928
Fine, then!
I'll get more from home!

340
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,722
But what'll we do

341
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,141
till you get back?

342
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:20,604
There's only a handful left.

343
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,950
Stop that, you idiot!

344
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,911
Hide that money.
The master's returning.

345
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,128
I ran into you
at just the right time.

346
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:35,054
So you're still alive.
I figured you'd long since left this earth.

347
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,396
Now tell me,
what happened after that?

348
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,108
I hid among the grasses
in the moat until dark.

349
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:56,450
When the outer walls tumbled down
on me in flames, I knew I was finished.

350
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:59,912
What ran through your mind
at that moment?

351
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:03,791
Nothing special.

352
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:08,921
Sick of fighting yet?

353
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:23,977
Truth is, there's a tough battle ahead
leading to neither money nor rank.

354
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:26,563
Will you join us?
- Yes.

355
00:43:27,398 --> 00:43:29,608
This may be the one
that kills us.

356
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:52,506
Where are they
when you need 'em?

357
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:54,800
What do you need, sir?

358
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:57,177
Samurai.

359
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:03,392
There's a pretty poor excuse for one
in my backyard.

360
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,187
I couldn't believe his gumption.

361
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:10,149
He says,
"I'm hungry. Feed me.

362
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:14,403
I'm broke, though,
so I'll pay you by chopping wood."

363
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:23,162
I like his frankness.

364
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:05,788
Never seen a man
split wood before?

365
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:08,457
Sure, but you do it
with such relish.

366
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:12,586
It's just my nature.
Sorry if it bothers you.

367
00:45:17,383 --> 00:45:18,676
You're very good.

368
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:22,221
It's nothing compared
to how I cut down men.

369
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:25,891
- Have you cut down many?
- That I have.

370
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:28,811
There's no cutting me off
when I start cutting.

371
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:35,484
So I make it a point
to run away first.

372
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:39,071
A most excellent approach.

373
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:41,448
Why, thank you kindly.

374
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:53,502
Tell me, do you feel like
cutting down 30 bandits?

375
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:14,106
Let us commence!

376
00:47:45,114 --> 00:47:46,323
Too bad.

377
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:47,783
It's a draw.

378
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:49,493
I'm afraid not.

379
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:50,953
I won.

380
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,708
That's ridiculous!

381
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:00,212
If these were steel,
you'd be dead now.

382
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,469
- Then we fight with steel!
- Don't throw your life away.

383
00:48:07,678 --> 00:48:08,387
What?

384
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:11,890
Don't you see?
With steel blades, you'd die.

385
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:13,517
It's a waste of your life.

386
00:48:13,726 --> 00:48:16,145
Wait! Don't try to flee.

387
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:22,735
Draw! This isn't
a contest of words!

388
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,858
This is preposterous.

389
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:06,153
There's no contest.

390
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,687
How did you fare?

391
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:46,694
We let a good fish get away.
An excellent swordsman.

392
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,239
They say the fish that gets away
looks bigger than it really is.

393
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:51,657
No.

394
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:56,245
I watched him cut a man down
with my own eyes.

395
00:50:03,252 --> 00:50:04,920
It was amazing.

396
00:50:05,254 --> 00:50:09,341
A man obsessed only
with testing the limits of his skill.

397
00:50:09,925 --> 00:50:11,969
I doubt he'll join us.

398
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:14,555
- That's a shame.
- Indeed.

399
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:18,726
I did tell him
where we're staying, though.

400
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:20,978
And how did you fare?

401
00:50:21,562 --> 00:50:23,355
- Caught one.
- I see.

402
00:50:23,564 --> 00:50:26,984
- As a swordsman, barely mediocre.
- Barely mediocre?

403
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:31,405
But an honest, amusing man.

404
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:34,366
Something about him
brightens one's spirits.

405
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,244
He'll be a treasure in hard times.

406
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:38,996
Much obliged.

407
00:50:41,123 --> 00:50:45,961
Actually, I did land one myself.
- The one dressed as a peddler?

408
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:47,254
That's right.

409
00:50:47,463 --> 00:50:50,090
In fact, he's an old trusted friend.

410
00:50:56,055 --> 00:50:57,931
I'll bring some water.

411
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:03,729
I'm Heihachi Hayashida.

412
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:06,899
A modest warrior
of the Wood-Chop School.

413
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:15,741
Just three more to go.

414
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:18,285
Three? Don't you mean two?

415
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:20,913
No, we can't afford
to take a child along.

416
00:51:22,456 --> 00:51:23,374
Master!

417
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,542
I know, I know.

418
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:28,337
I know what you'll say.

419
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:32,716
I was once your age, you know.

420
00:51:33,884 --> 00:51:35,844
Hone your skills,

421
00:51:36,095 --> 00:51:39,306
then go to war
and do great things.

422
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:43,560
Then become lord
of your own castle and domain.

423
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,817
But as you dream those dreams,
before you know it,

424
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:52,152
your hair will turn
as gray as mine.

425
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:57,866
By that time

426
00:51:58,075 --> 00:52:01,537
you've lost your parents
and you're all alone.

427
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:51,712
Tomorrow you go home.

428
00:52:52,129 --> 00:52:54,631
You've learned a lot
these four or five days.

429
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,759
You have
fine stories to tell.

430
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:16,362
Please, sir.
I beg you to let him come along.

431
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,531
Why not let him come?
You call him a kid, but --

432
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,075
Actually,

433
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:23,494
kids work harder than adults.

434
00:53:24,453 --> 00:53:28,082
But only if you treat them
like adults.

435
00:53:28,749 --> 00:53:32,127
Then let's treat him
like an adult.

436
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:40,302
That means only two more.

437
00:53:40,511 --> 00:53:43,681
Actually just one, it seems.

438
00:53:50,145 --> 00:53:52,272
You wish to join us?

439
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:55,442
I'm very grateful.

440
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:57,653
- When do we depart?
- Tomorrow.

441
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:02,491
Tomorrow?

442
00:54:04,326 --> 00:54:08,205
This is enough. We don't have time
to find the last one.

443
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:12,626
All right, then.

444
00:54:16,046 --> 00:54:17,589
Master!

445
00:54:18,507 --> 00:54:20,217
Master!
- All right.

446
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:24,471
- Master!
- All right! That's enough of that!

447
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:32,146
Hey, I just found
a real tough samurai.

448
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:34,690
There was a huge fight.
They were no match for him.

449
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:37,484
Never seen anything like it.
He's like a wild dog.

450
00:54:37,693 --> 00:54:40,654
Someone stopped the fight.
They started drinking.

451
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:42,489
I told him about you.

452
00:54:42,698 --> 00:54:44,450
He's on his way.

453
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:48,829
Shall we give him the usual?

454
00:55:02,843 --> 00:55:04,553
What are you doing?

455
00:55:05,012 --> 00:55:06,680
Testing him.

456
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,683
That's a dirty trick!

457
00:55:09,892 --> 00:55:12,353
Hey, samurai!
- Just shut up and watch.

458
00:55:12,561 --> 00:55:14,563
A true samurai won't get hit.

459
00:55:14,772 --> 00:55:16,440
But this guy's drunk!

460
00:55:16,649 --> 00:55:19,485
A samurai never drinks
enough to dull his wits.

461
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:36,919
I told you!
You guys are nuts.

462
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:39,838
What the --

463
00:55:43,759 --> 00:55:46,553
Who the hell hit me?

464
00:56:02,277 --> 00:56:03,904
You?

465
00:56:08,951 --> 00:56:12,246
Who hit me?

466
00:56:18,085 --> 00:56:19,545
You?

467
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:24,258
Damn bastard!

468
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:54,663
You again!

469
00:56:57,291 --> 00:57:00,711
I see that bald head of yours
in my dreams!

470
00:57:03,297 --> 00:57:05,215
Hey, you.

471
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:08,969
How dare you even ask me
if I'm a samurai!

472
00:57:09,553 --> 00:57:11,555
You got some nerve!

473
00:57:13,474 --> 00:57:15,267
Don't mess with me.

474
00:57:22,149 --> 00:57:25,569
I may look like hell,
but I'm a real samurai!

475
00:57:29,114 --> 00:57:33,535
I've been looking for you
ever since that day.

476
00:57:34,745 --> 00:57:36,830
Wanted you to see this.

477
00:57:45,297 --> 00:57:46,840
Look at this!

478
00:57:47,049 --> 00:57:52,054
This is my family tree.
All my ancestors are here.

479
00:57:53,972 --> 00:57:58,227
Damn you, trying to make
a fool outta me. Screw you.

480
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:01,438
Looky here.

481
00:58:03,065 --> 00:58:04,858
Making a fool outta me.

482
00:58:11,532 --> 00:58:13,784
My honorable self
is right here.

483
00:58:14,743 --> 00:58:17,204
So this Kikuchiyo here
would be you?

484
00:58:17,413 --> 00:58:19,206
That is correct.

485
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:23,752
"Kikuchiyo,
born February 17, 1574."

486
00:58:25,796 --> 00:58:27,923
What's so damned funny?

487
00:58:29,466 --> 00:58:32,177
You hardly look
13 years old to me.

488
00:58:33,095 --> 00:58:37,057
If you are in fact
the Kikuchiyo listed here,

489
00:58:37,266 --> 00:58:40,102
you'd now be precisely
13 years old.

490
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:47,359
Where'd you steal
this family tree?

491
00:58:47,943 --> 00:58:51,322
Steal it? Shit!

492
00:58:51,947 --> 00:58:53,949
Damn jerks.

493
00:58:54,116 --> 00:58:56,160
To hell with samurai.

494
00:58:57,661 --> 00:58:59,788
To hell with samurai!

495
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:05,044
Hey, you bastard!

496
00:59:06,503 --> 00:59:09,173
Come back here!

497
00:59:09,381 --> 00:59:12,593
Goddamn it,
you son of a bitch!

498
00:59:22,811 --> 00:59:26,106
What's wrong, teenager?
Here you are.

499
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:30,486
Damn you!

500
00:59:32,154 --> 00:59:34,073
Come back here!

501
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:11,068
What's wrong, Lord Kikuchiyo?

502
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,950
What's the matter, junior?

503
01:00:27,584 --> 01:00:30,170
Screw samurai!

504
01:00:46,729 --> 01:00:50,399
- Is he really a samurai?
- In his own mind, anyway.

505
01:01:01,535 --> 01:01:03,454
<i>Take me too!</i>

506
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,794
Hey, Kikuchiyo.

507
01:01:13,464 --> 01:01:15,341
Guard your treasure.

508
01:01:17,217 --> 01:01:20,179
Let me go too!

509
01:02:00,803 --> 01:02:02,930
What is it, Father?

510
01:02:19,488 --> 01:02:21,281
What is it?

511
01:02:22,157 --> 01:02:24,326
What are you staring at?

512
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:36,088
Shino, cut off your hair.

513
01:02:36,296 --> 01:02:38,882
Cut your hair
and dress like a man.

514
01:02:41,051 --> 01:02:43,554
- What are you talking about?
- Just cut it off!

515
01:02:44,555 --> 01:02:48,475
It's only because I love you.
No telling what those samurai'll do!

516
01:02:48,684 --> 01:02:49,601
No!

517
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:52,187
No, I won't!

518
01:02:56,525 --> 01:02:58,027
Shino!

519
01:03:22,885 --> 01:03:24,219
He's a fool.

520
01:03:24,428 --> 01:03:27,890
But Manzo knows those samurai
better than anyone.

521
01:03:28,057 --> 01:03:30,184
If he cut off his daughter's hair,
he must have good reason.

522
01:03:30,392 --> 01:03:33,520
You've only got sons,
so you're safe, but we --

523
01:03:33,729 --> 01:03:36,231
Goddamn it!
Now I understand.

524
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,319
So you agree to hide my daughter
at your place across the bridge?

525
01:03:40,527 --> 01:03:43,447
Idiot! I meant that I see
what Manzo's up to.

526
01:03:44,198 --> 01:03:49,870
That rascal doesn't care about the village,
only about his daughter.

527
01:03:50,245 --> 01:03:51,622
Damn him!

528
01:04:10,724 --> 01:04:12,893
Look what you've done!

529
01:04:13,394 --> 01:04:15,437
Now the whole village is crazed.

530
01:04:15,646 --> 01:04:17,898
Every family
with a girl's gone mad.

531
01:04:19,692 --> 01:04:21,735
How do you plan
to set this right?

532
01:04:21,986 --> 01:04:24,738
The samurai will show up
any day now.

533
01:04:25,614 --> 01:04:28,575
Come on.
We're seeing the Old Man.

534
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:33,664
There's nothing to see here!
Go home!

535
01:04:34,957 --> 01:04:36,333
Go home!

536
01:04:38,127 --> 01:04:41,672
We can't let the samurai
see us like this.

537
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:50,431
He's still following us.

538
01:06:35,744 --> 01:06:37,788
Where did Kikuchiyo go?

539
01:06:38,747 --> 01:06:40,457
Think he gave up?

540
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:42,459
It's funny.

541
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:44,878
Now that he's gone,
it's almost a little...

542
01:06:45,254 --> 01:06:47,047
Lonely.

543
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,555
This way.

544
01:06:56,974 --> 01:06:58,851
Oh, hell!

545
01:07:11,822 --> 01:07:14,366
So that's our castle, eh?

546
01:07:15,451 --> 01:07:18,203
No way I'm gonna die
in that dungheap.

547
01:07:18,412 --> 01:07:20,914
No one asked you to.

548
01:07:39,308 --> 01:07:43,228
We're back!
The samurai have arrived!

549
01:07:48,275 --> 01:07:50,235
The samurai are here!

550
01:07:54,948 --> 01:07:58,619
What's wrong with you?
The samurai are here!

551
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,752
Hey, what's wrong?

552
01:08:10,839 --> 01:08:12,633
What's the matter?

553
01:08:26,647 --> 01:08:28,983
This is a fine welcome.

554
01:08:32,611 --> 01:08:34,655
What's the meaning of this?

555
01:08:37,574 --> 01:08:41,495
Hey, what's going on?
The samurai have arrived!

556
01:08:57,636 --> 01:08:59,972
- We'll go see the Old Man.
- The Old Man?

557
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:03,142
Whatever happens in the village,
the Old Man --

558
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:05,352
He's the village elder?

559
01:09:06,895 --> 01:09:11,358
An audience with the village elder.
This is truly an honor.

560
01:09:15,237 --> 01:09:16,864
Well, let's go.

561
01:10:28,894 --> 01:10:34,274
I know they're being foolish.

562
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:38,529
All farmers ever do is worry,

563
01:10:38,737 --> 01:10:43,575
whether the rain falls,
the sun shines, or the wind blows.

564
01:10:43,909 --> 01:10:45,953
In short,

565
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:50,124
all they know is fear.

566
01:10:50,499 --> 01:10:54,169
Their behavior today...

567
01:10:55,796 --> 01:10:59,299
is also due simply to fear.

568
01:11:02,052 --> 01:11:07,099
But Old Man,
why do the villagers fear us?

569
01:11:08,017 --> 01:11:11,812
What can they expect from us
under such circumstances?

570
01:11:42,551 --> 01:11:44,261
Samurai, sirs!

571
01:11:44,928 --> 01:11:47,473
Samurai, please!

572
01:12:04,406 --> 01:12:07,618
Quiet down!

573
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:10,913
Don't panic. Calm down.

574
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:14,333
I want clear answers.

575
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:16,835
Where are the bandits
coming from?

576
01:12:17,044 --> 01:12:20,297
- The mountains!
- No, the road!

577
01:12:23,592 --> 01:12:26,720
Who saw the bandits?
Come forward.

578
01:12:27,012 --> 01:12:29,223
No one saw any bandits?

579
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:31,934
Then who sounded the alarm?

580
01:12:32,142 --> 01:12:33,394
<i>I did!</i>

581
01:12:39,942 --> 01:12:42,236
Outta the way.

582
01:12:46,865 --> 01:12:49,368
What's with the faces?

583
01:12:50,661 --> 01:12:53,706
Don't worry.
No bandits have come.

584
01:12:59,044 --> 01:13:00,754
Hey, blockheads.

585
01:13:00,963 --> 01:13:04,633
Remember how you welcomed us
when we got here?

586
01:13:04,967 --> 01:13:07,636
But as soon as I bang on this,

587
01:13:07,845 --> 01:13:11,223
"Samurai, sirs!
Samurai, please!"

588
01:13:11,682 --> 01:13:13,934
You're practically groveling!

589
01:13:18,814 --> 01:13:21,442
Got what you deserved,
you mud snails.

590
01:13:39,209 --> 01:13:41,754
Got a problem, gramps?

591
01:13:41,962 --> 01:13:43,255
Nope.

592
01:13:43,672 --> 01:13:45,758
All's well now.

593
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:54,099
Looks like he's good
for something after all.

594
01:13:54,308 --> 01:13:56,894
There are seven of us at last.

595
01:14:04,109 --> 01:14:06,070
Sorry it's so dirty.

596
01:14:06,278 --> 01:14:10,115
But where will you sleep
if we take your home?

597
01:14:10,407 --> 01:14:13,827
- In the barn.
- With your horse?

598
01:14:15,371 --> 01:14:18,290
The bandits
got my horse last year.

599
01:14:35,641 --> 01:14:39,228
A barn's not so bad
with a wife to snuggle up to.

600
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,693
I don't have a wife!

601
01:14:45,901 --> 01:14:47,611
What's the matter, you fool?

602
01:14:59,248 --> 01:15:00,708
Jerk.

603
01:15:14,263 --> 01:15:16,932
By the way,
what's your real name?

604
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:20,686
I don't remember.

605
01:15:21,103 --> 01:15:23,439
Give me a new one that fits.

606
01:15:23,939 --> 01:15:26,108
Then Kikuchiyo it is.

607
01:15:27,318 --> 01:15:29,445
Fits you perfectly.

608
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,328
How would you attack
this village?

609
01:15:54,536 --> 01:15:57,122
I'd charge from this mountain.

610
01:15:58,749 --> 01:16:00,834
I agree.
Along this road.

611
01:16:01,418 --> 01:16:03,587
WEST

612
01:16:18,644 --> 01:16:21,438
And what's the best defense?

613
01:16:21,772 --> 01:16:23,816
Shichiroji knows what to do.

614
01:16:24,567 --> 01:16:27,945
See these logs?
He'll make a fence to block the horses.

615
01:16:28,153 --> 01:16:30,614
Indeed.
Your trusty right-hand man.

616
01:16:59,602 --> 01:17:00,895
All right!

617
01:17:01,562 --> 01:17:03,105
Listen.

618
01:17:04,231 --> 01:17:06,233
Nothing forces you to run
like a battle.

619
01:17:06,775 --> 01:17:09,612
You run when you attack,
you run when you retreat.

620
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:12,156
When you can't run anymore,
you die.

621
01:17:30,674 --> 01:17:33,177
SOUTH

622
01:17:46,523 --> 01:17:50,194
We'll flood these fields
after they harvest the barley.

623
01:17:50,486 --> 01:17:55,074
That'll make a good defense.
But will we have time?

624
01:17:55,282 --> 01:17:56,575
Indeed.

625
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:05,626
Charge!

626
01:18:06,627 --> 01:18:10,756
Pretend I'm a bandit
and stab me.

627
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,386
Charge!

628
01:18:18,597 --> 01:18:20,266
Come on!

629
01:18:29,275 --> 01:18:30,693
<i>Next. </i>

630
01:18:32,444 --> 01:18:33,946
<i>Next. </i>

631
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,323
What's wrong with all of you?

632
01:19:00,431 --> 01:19:03,559
EAST

633
01:19:07,104 --> 01:19:11,650
Destroying this bridge
will foil an assault from the east.

634
01:19:18,741 --> 01:19:21,869
But what about the houses
on the other side?

635
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:31,795
They'll have to evacuate those.

636
01:19:36,175 --> 01:19:38,260
And the mill?

637
01:19:40,221 --> 01:19:43,390
The Old Man's
not going to go quietly.

638
01:19:49,605 --> 01:19:52,441
Listen now.
The enemy is scary.

639
01:19:53,067 --> 01:19:54,526
Everybody's scared.

640
01:19:54,777 --> 01:19:58,197
But the other side's
scared of us too.

641
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:29,270
Just great.

642
01:20:30,271 --> 01:20:32,940
You all make great scarecrows.

643
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:39,238
Problem is, the enemy
isn't a bunch of sparrows and crows!

644
01:20:47,705 --> 01:20:51,375
You there, chewing your cud.
Can you cut that out?

645
01:20:55,504 --> 01:20:57,548
This isn't a cow shed!

646
01:21:00,885 --> 01:21:03,262
Look at the bunch of you.

647
01:21:06,223 --> 01:21:07,808
Shit!

648
01:21:08,017 --> 01:21:10,728
First in line, step forward!

649
01:21:13,105 --> 01:21:15,107
I'm talking to you!

650
01:21:15,691 --> 01:21:16,901
You!

651
01:21:37,171 --> 01:21:40,424
<i>Look here! You gotta pay
a mon each to watch the show!</i>

652
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,070
What's this?

653
01:22:02,071 --> 01:22:05,032
- A spear, sir.
- Idiot.

654
01:22:05,241 --> 01:22:07,952
Where the hell
did you get it?

655
01:22:08,869 --> 01:22:11,372
Did it sprout up in those hills?

656
01:22:13,749 --> 01:22:15,209
I know perfectly well.

657
01:22:15,417 --> 01:22:17,878
You hunted down retreating warriors
and took their weapons.

658
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:21,882
If you've got one,
you must have more.

659
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:26,387
Fess up, damn it!

660
01:22:35,187 --> 01:22:37,648
NORTH

661
01:22:47,074 --> 01:22:51,287
What a peaceful grove.
But it's also a death trap.

662
01:23:27,156 --> 01:23:28,616
Katsushiro.

663
01:23:29,033 --> 01:23:31,243
We're going.
- I'll be right there.

664
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:41,128
As I said,
he's still a child.

665
01:24:42,731 --> 01:24:45,526
Are you from the village?

666
01:24:50,072 --> 01:24:51,448
Are you a girl?

667
01:24:55,202 --> 01:24:57,413
A boy?

668
01:24:58,247 --> 01:25:01,208
Then where's your spear?

669
01:25:01,417 --> 01:25:04,837
Is this any time for an able-bodied man
to be picking flowers?

670
01:25:05,713 --> 01:25:08,007
Come here!
I'll teach you.

671
01:25:08,465 --> 01:25:10,009
Come here!

672
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:16,056
Why, you!

673
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:23,791
This is fine, and this too.

674
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:25,876
But this is a problem.

675
01:26:26,418 --> 01:26:28,921
<i>Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

676
01:26:31,799 --> 01:26:34,218
Get back, the rest of you!

677
01:26:34,843 --> 01:26:37,346
Stand up straight!

678
01:26:42,685 --> 01:26:44,478
What a haul!

679
01:26:50,985 --> 01:26:52,278
What's all this?

680
01:26:52,486 --> 01:26:54,822
Plunder from defeated warriors.

681
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:58,325
Where did you find it?

682
01:26:58,534 --> 01:27:01,537
Here in the village?
- Yep, over at Manzo's.

683
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,840
What's the matter?

684
01:27:14,925 --> 01:27:16,677
Don't you like 'em?

685
01:27:18,846 --> 01:27:21,348
This is good stuff.

686
01:27:22,975 --> 01:27:24,518
What's wrong?

687
01:27:24,727 --> 01:27:28,147
You said you wanted armor,
spears and bows. Now you got 'em.

688
01:27:28,355 --> 01:27:30,774
Bastard!
You call yourself a samurai?

689
01:27:32,067 --> 01:27:35,029
Those farmers killed samurai
to get these.

690
01:27:35,237 --> 01:27:37,197
- I know that.
- Then why the hell --

691
01:27:37,406 --> 01:27:39,241
That's enough!

692
01:27:40,576 --> 01:27:44,205
You can't understand
unless you've been hunted.

693
01:27:57,051 --> 01:27:59,762
It's nothing.
Get outta here.

694
01:28:23,077 --> 01:28:27,957
Now I want to kill them all.

695
01:28:41,845 --> 01:28:43,764
Well, that's just fine and dandy!

696
01:28:46,267 --> 01:28:50,729
What did ya think
these farmers were anyway?

697
01:28:50,938 --> 01:28:53,440
Buddhas or something?

698
01:28:53,983 --> 01:28:55,568
Don't make me laugh!

699
01:28:55,818 --> 01:28:58,237
There's no creature on earth
as wily as a farmer!

700
01:29:04,118 --> 01:29:06,954
Ask 'em for rice, barley,
anything,

701
01:29:07,121 --> 01:29:09,498
and all they ever say is,
"We're all out."

702
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:15,212
But they've got it.
They've got everything.

703
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:20,134
Dig under the floorboards.
If it's not there, try the barn.

704
01:29:20,342 --> 01:29:25,806
You'll find plenty.
Jars of rice, salt, beans, sake!

705
01:29:30,853 --> 01:29:34,023
Go up in the mountains.
They have hidden fields.

706
01:29:34,607 --> 01:29:37,234
They kowtow and lie,
playing innocent the whole time.

707
01:29:37,443 --> 01:29:39,820
You name it,
they'll cheat you on it!

708
01:29:40,029 --> 01:29:43,073
After a battle, they hunt down
the losers with their spears.

709
01:29:45,492 --> 01:29:46,619
Listen to me!

710
01:29:46,827 --> 01:29:50,331
Farmers are misers, weasels,

711
01:29:50,539 --> 01:29:51,790
and crybabies!

712
01:29:51,999 --> 01:29:54,335
They're mean, stupid

713
01:29:54,543 --> 01:29:56,337
murderers!

714
01:29:56,545 --> 01:29:59,632
Damn!
I could laugh till I cry!

715
01:30:03,344 --> 01:30:07,139
But tell me this:
Who turned them into such monsters?

716
01:30:07,389 --> 01:30:10,809
You did!
You samurai did!

717
01:30:11,227 --> 01:30:13,020
Damn you to hell!

718
01:30:19,944 --> 01:30:21,737
In war, you burn their villages,

719
01:30:21,946 --> 01:30:25,032
trample their fields,
steal their food,

720
01:30:25,866 --> 01:30:28,869
work them like slaves,
rape their women,

721
01:30:29,078 --> 01:30:30,704
and kill 'em if they resist.

722
01:30:30,913 --> 01:30:32,790
What do you expect 'em to do?

723
01:30:32,998 --> 01:30:35,292
What the hell are farmers
supposed to do?

724
01:30:35,501 --> 01:30:37,962
Damn it! Goddamn it!

725
01:31:15,749 --> 01:31:19,378
You were born a farmer,
weren't you?

726
01:31:56,957 --> 01:32:00,252
What is it now?

727
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:04,381
Nothing at all.
Everything's fine.

728
01:33:10,072 --> 01:33:11,615
It's me.

729
01:33:11,866 --> 01:33:13,909
I'm sleeping here
from now on.

730
01:33:14,577 --> 01:33:16,871
Those guys cramp my style.

731
01:33:18,706 --> 01:33:21,750
Idiot! Stop cowering!

732
01:33:22,418 --> 01:33:24,461
This is your place!

733
01:33:25,004 --> 01:33:27,798
You hand over your house
and sleep in a barn,

734
01:33:28,007 --> 01:33:29,800
and still you can't stand up
for yourself.

735
01:33:30,009 --> 01:33:31,510
Get to sleep!

736
01:33:48,152 --> 01:33:50,070
Brings back memories.

737
01:34:08,464 --> 01:34:10,424
Sure is quiet.

738
01:34:13,344 --> 01:34:18,641
On a day like this, it's hard
to imagine bandits on that mountain.

739
01:34:20,601 --> 01:34:23,687
Damn it all,
I need a girl!

740
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:33,989
- Where are you going?
- The hills.

741
01:34:34,198 --> 01:34:36,242
- The hills?
- To practice.

742
01:34:37,952 --> 01:34:39,537
No girls up there.

743
01:34:41,247 --> 01:34:43,958
Sometimes you really
hit the nail on the head.

744
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:47,419
What are you making there?

745
01:34:47,628 --> 01:34:49,547
- A flag.
- A flag?

746
01:34:50,297 --> 01:34:55,928
It doesn't feel right in battle
without a banner to raise high.

747
01:35:00,766 --> 01:35:02,476
What do the symbols mean?

748
01:35:02,643 --> 01:35:07,481
This represents a field:
That is, the farmers and this village.

749
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:10,776
- And those circles?
- Those are us.

750
01:35:11,735 --> 01:35:14,321
There's only six.
You leaving me out?

751
01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:17,616
No, this triangle's Lord Kikuchiyo.

752
01:35:17,825 --> 01:35:19,702
That's a good one!

753
01:36:40,908 --> 01:36:42,618
It's real rice.

754
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:44,828
Go ahead. Eat.
- But --

755
01:36:45,037 --> 01:36:47,206
Rikichi gave me some millet.

756
01:36:47,414 --> 01:36:51,710
I could barely get it down.

757
01:36:53,754 --> 01:36:55,506
Go ahead. Eat.

758
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:08,269
Hurry up and eat.

759
01:37:08,435 --> 01:37:10,312
If you're embarrassed, I'll go.

760
01:37:10,521 --> 01:37:12,356
I'm not going to eat it.

761
01:37:12,606 --> 01:37:14,775
Why not?
I went to a lot of trouble.

762
01:37:14,984 --> 01:37:16,902
No, I just --

763
01:37:18,153 --> 01:37:23,450
I know you did, so I'll take it
to Kyuemon's grandma.

764
01:37:23,659 --> 01:37:26,412
Kyuemon's grandma?

765
01:37:47,099 --> 01:37:51,353
Rikichi, I'm full.
I'll save the rest for later.

766
01:37:52,104 --> 01:37:54,481
Go ahead and eat.

767
01:37:54,732 --> 01:37:56,692
Take my leftovers this time.

768
01:37:57,693 --> 01:38:01,280
What's this?
What are you up to?

769
01:38:01,488 --> 01:38:02,990
What's going on?

770
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,833
How terrible.

771
01:38:14,335 --> 01:38:18,422
Doesn't she have family?
- The bandits got them all.

772
01:38:24,887 --> 01:38:26,347
I...

773
01:38:27,223 --> 01:38:32,019
want to die quickly.

774
01:38:32,186 --> 01:38:36,440
I want to die soon

775
01:38:36,649 --> 01:38:40,861
and leave this suffering behind.

776
01:38:42,488 --> 01:38:44,865
But you know...

777
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:49,828
the other world may be

778
01:38:50,037 --> 01:38:54,166
just as full of suffering
as this one.

779
01:38:56,001 --> 01:38:57,753
It's not.

780
01:38:57,962 --> 01:39:02,299
In that world
there's no war and no bandits.

781
01:39:02,675 --> 01:39:04,843
There's no suffering there,
grandma.

782
01:39:05,052 --> 01:39:08,639
How the hell would you know?
Have you been there?

783
01:39:08,847 --> 01:39:10,558
Why the hell
are you always screaming?

784
01:39:10,766 --> 01:39:12,476
I hate wimps.

785
01:39:12,685 --> 01:39:15,312
Worms like her make me sick!

786
01:39:17,898 --> 01:39:19,984
Pissing and grumbling
about everything.

787
01:39:21,443 --> 01:39:24,446
Shit!
I want to do something wild!

788
01:39:24,697 --> 01:39:28,576
Save your spit and fire
for the bandits.

789
01:39:44,341 --> 01:39:46,135
Excuse me.

790
01:39:48,095 --> 01:39:51,223
Excuse me, but why did you --

791
01:39:51,515 --> 01:39:54,226
You saw us today, didn't you?

792
01:39:54,435 --> 01:39:56,896
Me and the --

793
01:39:57,104 --> 01:39:59,064
- The girl?
- Yes.

794
01:40:00,065 --> 01:40:03,819
Why didn't you --
- Tell them? You want me to?

795
01:40:19,001 --> 01:40:23,464
We want rice!
White rice!

796
01:40:28,219 --> 01:40:31,805
You little brats!
There's no rice!

797
01:40:37,561 --> 01:40:39,563
Quit yapping!

798
01:40:39,772 --> 01:40:44,735
If you've got the strength
to scream, "We want rice!"

799
01:40:44,944 --> 01:40:47,321
Then you don't need it!

800
01:40:47,738 --> 01:40:50,574
Listen here,
you little piss pants.

801
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:54,828
This is all the rice there is.

802
01:40:55,037 --> 01:40:58,249
If we give you any more,
we'll get all --

803
01:41:01,961 --> 01:41:03,420
That's how it is.

804
01:41:03,629 --> 01:41:07,383
Say, any of you got
a pretty sister?

805
01:41:09,843 --> 01:41:13,556
How about you?
You got one?

806
01:41:13,806 --> 01:41:17,351
So, Old Man,
when is the harvest?

807
01:41:19,728 --> 01:41:21,522
In ten days.

808
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:24,024
How quickly can you do it?

809
01:41:26,026 --> 01:41:28,904
No less than three days.

810
01:41:29,947 --> 01:41:31,991
We'll flood the fields
when you're done.

811
01:41:32,199 --> 01:41:36,036
You see, we want to create
a moat to the south of the village.

812
01:41:36,203 --> 01:41:38,330
It'll keep the horses out.

813
01:41:38,539 --> 01:41:41,876
We don't need all the fields.
One patch per family will do.

814
01:41:42,084 --> 01:41:43,586
Then...

815
01:41:44,128 --> 01:41:48,424
it'll take at least a day to flatten
the paths and draw the water.

816
01:41:48,632 --> 01:41:50,968
Understood.

817
01:41:51,302 --> 01:41:53,554
There's one other thing.

818
01:41:54,054 --> 01:42:00,352
You need to leave the houses this side
of the bridge, and the mill too.

819
01:42:01,437 --> 01:42:03,230
Father!

820
01:42:03,522 --> 01:42:05,649
You want us to move out?

821
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:15,242
I know it's tough.

822
01:42:16,911 --> 01:42:19,038
But there's no choice.

823
01:42:20,664 --> 01:42:24,585
We can't possibly protect
the outlying houses.

824
01:42:45,773 --> 01:42:49,068
Listen carefully. You'll soon
begin harvesting the barley.

825
01:42:49,318 --> 01:42:51,278
The bandits will come
when you're done.

826
01:42:51,445 --> 01:42:53,322
We have to assume that.

827
01:42:53,531 --> 01:42:57,284
Therefore we prepare
for battle as we harvest.

828
01:42:57,660 --> 01:43:01,205
We'll harvest not as families
but as squads.

829
01:43:01,705 --> 01:43:06,001
Starting tomorrow,
each squad will live and work as one.

830
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:11,090
Understood? Starting tomorrow,
nobody acts on his own.

831
01:43:12,383 --> 01:43:14,260
Hey, everybody.

832
01:43:15,886 --> 01:43:19,807
Give your wives
plenty of lovin' tonight, you hear?

833
01:43:40,995 --> 01:43:43,539
This is all a load of crap!

834
01:43:43,747 --> 01:43:46,500
Everyone from across the bridge,
follow me.

835
01:43:49,211 --> 01:43:51,297
Throw down your spears.

836
01:43:51,505 --> 01:43:55,509
Why should we abandon
our homes to protect theirs?

837
01:43:56,427 --> 01:43:59,972
That's right.
We'll protect our homes ourselves.

838
01:44:02,057 --> 01:44:03,642
Stop!

839
01:44:06,812 --> 01:44:08,647
Pick up your spears!

840
01:44:09,315 --> 01:44:10,774
Return to your line!

841
01:44:36,592 --> 01:44:38,844
Fall in!

842
01:44:39,762 --> 01:44:42,014
Squad formation!

843
01:44:45,059 --> 01:44:47,478
Where's Yohei gone?

844
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,564
Where the hell's Yohei?

845
01:44:56,111 --> 01:44:59,198
There you are, you idiot!

846
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:19,009
There are three outlying houses,

847
01:45:19,885 --> 01:45:21,887
but 20 in the village.

848
01:45:22,763 --> 01:45:26,725
We can't risk 20
to save three.

849
01:45:27,977 --> 01:45:32,273
And if this village is destroyed,

850
01:45:33,148 --> 01:45:35,359
those three cannot survive
on their own.

851
01:45:39,446 --> 01:45:42,908
Is that clear?
This is the nature of war:

852
01:45:44,451 --> 01:45:47,246
By protecting others,
you save yourself.

853
01:45:49,248 --> 01:45:51,709
If you only think of yourself,

854
01:45:52,209 --> 01:45:54,378
you'll only destroy yourself.

855
01:45:57,464 --> 01:46:01,260
From this day forward,
anyone caught doing that...

856
01:52:33,308 --> 01:52:34,935
Hot damn!

857
01:52:35,144 --> 01:52:36,937
Look at all those girls!

858
01:52:37,229 --> 01:52:38,564
Hey, Yohei!

859
01:52:44,153 --> 01:52:46,905
Where the hell
have you been hiding these girls?

860
01:52:51,243 --> 01:52:52,995
You devil.

861
01:53:00,836 --> 01:53:03,088
Hey, lend me your scythe.

862
01:53:04,298 --> 01:53:06,300
I'll cut three times your share.

863
01:53:06,508 --> 01:53:09,511
In return,
we get nice and friendly, eh?

864
01:53:33,577 --> 01:53:34,995
- Rikichi.
- Yes.

865
01:53:36,205 --> 01:53:39,875
It seems the married couples
are the most productive.

866
01:53:40,584 --> 01:53:42,711
Time you got yourself a wife.

867
01:53:46,131 --> 01:53:50,260
Why do you always get so mad?
I just said you should --

868
01:53:51,512 --> 01:53:53,764
Katsushiro, go after him.

869
01:53:53,972 --> 01:53:56,058
Running off at a time like this.

870
01:53:57,267 --> 01:53:58,685
Rikichi!

871
01:53:59,728 --> 01:54:01,146
Rikichi!

872
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:08,028
Shino, what are you gawking at?

873
01:54:24,169 --> 01:54:27,339
What's this? A bear's den?

874
01:54:29,383 --> 01:54:31,510
This was done with a scythe.

875
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:34,972
Was it Rikichi?

876
01:54:35,597 --> 01:54:38,058
Yes, though I didn't actually
see him do it.

877
01:54:38,267 --> 01:54:40,435
I lost him for a while,

878
01:54:40,644 --> 01:54:42,521
but then I spotted him
leaving this grove.

879
01:54:42,729 --> 01:54:45,858
He was furious,
soaked in sweat.

880
01:54:49,444 --> 01:54:51,113
What did you say to him?

881
01:54:51,321 --> 01:54:54,783
Nothing. Just that he should
hurry up and find a wife.

882
01:54:58,120 --> 01:55:02,291
Something's upsetting the little bugger,
but he won't say what.

883
01:55:02,791 --> 01:55:05,169
You can see it
all over his face.

884
01:55:06,003 --> 01:55:11,550
Those lips of his
are bolted up tight as a house.

885
01:55:11,758 --> 01:55:14,136
Why don't you try to open them up?

886
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:22,436
Who's there?

887
01:55:22,644 --> 01:55:23,896
<i>It's me. </i>

888
01:55:26,273 --> 01:55:28,775
All clear?
- Yes.

889
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:40,162
Have a seat.
Let's have a little chat.

890
01:55:45,375 --> 01:55:48,879
I think talking...

891
01:55:49,588 --> 01:55:51,423
is a good thing.

892
01:55:52,007 --> 01:55:55,969
Whatever your burden may be,
talking can ease it.

893
01:55:59,223 --> 01:56:03,101
You, for example,
seem pretty tight-lipped,

894
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:08,232
but if you're suffering,
you shouldn't bottle it up.

895
01:56:11,026 --> 01:56:15,489
Letting out your feelings
bit by bit can work wonders.

896
01:56:16,782 --> 01:56:19,409
I've got nothing to say.

897
01:56:37,052 --> 01:56:38,887
Time to head out.

898
01:56:41,431 --> 01:56:42,474
Shall we wake him?

899
01:56:42,683 --> 01:56:44,852
No, let the kid sleep.

900
01:56:48,814 --> 01:56:50,232
Shino.

901
01:56:53,026 --> 01:56:55,070
I swear he just said "Shino."

902
01:56:58,115 --> 01:56:59,950
Sounds like a woman's name.

903
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:02,953
Even kids can be charmers
in their dreams.

904
01:57:09,376 --> 01:57:11,879
Where shall we start our rounds?

905
01:57:12,087 --> 01:57:15,257
The place that worries us most,
of course.

906
01:58:12,648 --> 01:58:14,107
Who's there?

907
01:58:20,948 --> 01:58:22,449
Who's there?

908
01:58:22,991 --> 01:58:24,660
Come out here!

909
01:58:25,410 --> 01:58:26,370
Who's there?

910
01:58:26,578 --> 01:58:27,996
Kikuchiyo.

911
01:58:30,332 --> 01:58:32,417
You're lucky it was us.

912
01:58:32,835 --> 01:58:35,963
If we'd been bandits,
you'd be headless right now.

913
01:59:07,995 --> 01:59:09,496
Yohei.

914
01:59:10,873 --> 01:59:12,583
What's this?

915
01:59:12,916 --> 01:59:15,002
That's my horse, sir.

916
01:59:17,337 --> 01:59:20,132
I thought it was a big old mouse.

917
01:59:59,797 --> 02:00:03,842
<i>The sparrows chirp, chirp, chirp</i>

918
02:00:04,802 --> 02:00:08,597
<i>The crows caw, caw, caw</i>

919
02:00:12,434 --> 02:00:15,687
I wonder why
the bandits aren't coming.

920
02:00:18,023 --> 02:00:23,445
What a waste if they don't.
Think how much we feed those samurai.

921
02:00:23,612 --> 02:00:27,407
Idiot!
It's best if they don't come!

922
02:00:33,956 --> 02:00:37,209
A nag like that
can't carry your weight!

923
02:00:37,417 --> 02:00:40,671
Yohei's horse is too worn out.

924
02:00:42,798 --> 02:00:45,884
Please stop. Yohei'll be in tears
if you break its leg.

925
02:00:46,093 --> 02:00:49,596
A skilled horseman
can make even a nag soar into the sky.

926
02:01:01,650 --> 02:01:02,860
Not bad.

927
02:01:18,625 --> 02:01:20,544
Very fine indeed!

928
02:01:44,568 --> 02:01:46,612
They seem to be having fun.

929
02:01:48,197 --> 02:01:51,033
The threshing's done,
and still no bandits.

930
02:01:51,492 --> 02:01:54,870
Everyone's saying
they might not come after all.

931
02:01:56,121 --> 02:01:58,373
A tempting thought.

932
02:01:58,874 --> 02:02:04,087
But when you think you're safe
is precisely when you're most vulnerable.

933
02:02:05,380 --> 02:02:07,800
Send them back
to their posts.

934
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:45,003
I wish I'd been born
into a samurai family.

935
02:02:48,132 --> 02:02:50,092
A farmer's life is too cruel.

936
02:02:51,218 --> 02:02:54,221
My life has been so easy,
I'm ashamed.

937
02:02:54,429 --> 02:02:56,765
That's not what I meant.

938
02:02:57,141 --> 02:03:01,603
It's because you're a samurai
and I'm a farmer.

939
02:03:01,812 --> 02:03:03,230
But I don't --

940
02:03:03,438 --> 02:03:06,650
It's all right. I don't mind.
We can't know

941
02:03:06,859 --> 02:03:09,027
what the future holds!

942
02:03:42,352 --> 02:03:45,564
Coward!
Act like a samurai!

943
02:04:52,631 --> 02:04:55,384
Three suspicious characters
on the western road.

944
02:04:57,845 --> 02:05:00,597
- The villagers haven't noticed?
- Not yet.

945
02:05:00,806 --> 02:05:02,850
We can't have them
sounding the alarm.

946
02:05:05,227 --> 02:05:08,147
I saw three horses
up in the hills.

947
02:05:08,355 --> 02:05:11,233
I think they're bandits.
- We know.

948
02:05:15,946 --> 02:05:18,157
- So they're here.
- How did you know?

949
02:05:18,365 --> 02:05:21,535
How could I not?
This one here was in such a panic.

950
02:05:24,955 --> 02:05:27,541
Where are they coming from?
The mountains or the west?

951
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:31,420
The west.

952
02:05:40,095 --> 02:05:40,971
Bandits!

953
02:05:45,517 --> 02:05:48,562
Send everyone to their houses.
There are only three of them.

954
02:05:48,770 --> 02:05:51,565
Tell them to keep quiet
no matter what.

955
02:05:51,773 --> 02:05:56,111
They're probably scouts.
We can't let them see any samurai.

956
02:06:13,337 --> 02:06:15,422
What is it?

957
02:06:15,881 --> 02:06:17,633
Bandits?

958
02:06:20,302 --> 02:06:23,347
Bandits, eh?
Where are they?

959
02:06:35,025 --> 02:06:36,318
Quiet!

960
02:06:38,362 --> 02:06:40,197
Where are they, Shichiroji?

961
02:06:40,405 --> 02:06:43,117
Beyond the fence.

962
02:06:57,506 --> 02:07:00,092
No doubt about it -- they're scouts.

963
02:07:00,634 --> 02:07:02,511
The fence took them by surprise.

964
02:07:03,637 --> 02:07:06,014
They don't seem
to realize we're here.

965
02:07:06,181 --> 02:07:09,309
With luck they'll report
there are only farmers here.

966
02:07:10,853 --> 02:07:13,438
<i>Hey, where is everyone?</i>

967
02:07:13,647 --> 02:07:15,315
That idiot!

968
02:07:16,358 --> 02:07:18,277
Kikuchiyo!

969
02:07:24,533 --> 02:07:26,869
Hey, I hear the bandits are here.

970
02:07:28,537 --> 02:07:29,329
You fool.

971
02:07:29,538 --> 02:07:31,832
Too late.
They've seen us.

972
02:07:42,718 --> 02:07:46,180
If they report back that samurai
are here, we're finished.

973
02:07:47,097 --> 02:07:50,184
I'll kill them.
The mountain's my territory.

974
02:07:50,559 --> 02:07:51,560
I was just --

975
02:07:51,768 --> 02:07:55,522
Enough. You can make up for it
by getting one.

976
02:07:55,731 --> 02:07:57,065
Head them off at --

977
02:07:57,274 --> 02:08:00,110
I know, at their horses.
Take us there.

978
02:08:01,278 --> 02:08:02,863
Katsushiro!

979
02:08:03,739 --> 02:08:06,241
Just watch, you understand?

980
02:08:13,332 --> 02:08:15,501
Those are some horses!

981
02:08:20,339 --> 02:08:22,216
Wait in this hollow.

982
02:08:31,099 --> 02:08:33,811
- What do you plan to do?
- Who, me?

983
02:10:34,223 --> 02:10:36,391
Katsushiro.

984
02:10:37,226 --> 02:10:39,436
You can come out now.

985
02:10:42,773 --> 02:10:44,608
Help me!

986
02:11:03,710 --> 02:11:05,420
Back off!

987
02:11:06,755 --> 02:11:11,009
He's a captive who has confessed.
He's begging for his life.

988
02:11:11,218 --> 02:11:14,638
You can't just
chop him to pieces.

989
02:11:15,973 --> 02:11:17,182
Stay out of this!

990
02:11:18,934 --> 02:11:21,145
Let me do it! Scum!

991
02:11:39,246 --> 02:11:40,998
All right.

992
02:11:41,457 --> 02:11:44,084
Let her avenge her son's death.

993
02:11:46,462 --> 02:11:49,173
Someone help her!

994
02:11:49,381 --> 02:11:50,966
I'll do it!

995
02:11:59,850 --> 02:12:03,604
- That bandit said their fort --
- It's hardly a fort.

996
02:12:03,812 --> 02:12:07,649
It's full of holes,
like Yohei's underwear.

997
02:12:07,816 --> 02:12:10,152
- Easy to sneak in.
- Let's attack at night.

998
02:12:10,319 --> 02:12:13,906
They have 40 men.
We'd usually pick off a few first.

999
02:12:14,114 --> 02:12:17,034
Wait. We can't afford
to lose a single man,

1000
02:12:17,242 --> 02:12:19,661
even if we kill five
for every one lost.

1001
02:12:19,828 --> 02:12:24,374
- War is always a gamble.
- Three of us can take 10 of them.

1002
02:12:25,417 --> 02:12:26,919
Rikichi.

1003
02:12:27,127 --> 02:12:30,047
How far away is their hideout?

1004
02:12:30,255 --> 02:12:31,715
At least a day.

1005
02:12:31,924 --> 02:12:34,718
Hey, we've got
three of their horses.

1006
02:12:34,927 --> 02:12:36,970
Half a day by horse.

1007
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,627
Very well. Let's do it.

1008
02:12:51,835 --> 02:12:54,755
If we leave now,
we'll arrive before dawn.

1009
02:12:54,963 --> 02:12:56,673
But who should go?

1010
02:12:59,885 --> 02:13:01,011
Not you.

1011
02:13:03,764 --> 02:13:06,058
And me makes three.

1012
02:13:06,975 --> 02:13:08,852
They need a guide!

1013
02:13:09,061 --> 02:13:11,438
There aren't enough horses.

1014
02:13:11,647 --> 02:13:13,649
There's Yohei's horse.
You ride that.

1015
02:13:13,857 --> 02:13:16,068
The only man
to master that steed

1016
02:13:16,276 --> 02:13:17,820
is Lord Kikuchiyo himself.

1017
02:13:26,954 --> 02:13:29,123
Whoa! What the hell?

1018
02:13:29,998 --> 02:13:32,167
It's the other way!

1019
02:13:34,628 --> 02:13:36,463
Stupid horse!

1020
02:13:37,131 --> 02:13:41,051
This way, you useless mule!

1021
02:13:41,844 --> 02:13:44,388
You call yourself a horse?

1022
02:13:44,596 --> 02:13:46,682
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

1023
02:13:48,642 --> 02:13:50,436
Hey, wait!

1024
02:13:52,771 --> 02:13:56,567
Please stop!
I apologize!

1025
02:13:56,775 --> 02:13:58,235
I'm sorry!

1026
02:15:24,822 --> 02:15:27,241
Hey, let's set the place on fire!

1027
02:15:27,449 --> 02:15:29,326
Cut 'em down as they run out!

1028
02:18:03,689 --> 02:18:05,649
Serves you right!

1029
02:18:06,316 --> 02:18:08,026
We did it!

1030
02:18:10,487 --> 02:18:12,448
Take that, you sons of bitches!

1031
02:18:55,491 --> 02:18:56,784
Heihachi!

1032
02:19:17,638 --> 02:19:19,932
Are you crazy?

1033
02:19:35,739 --> 02:19:36,949
Stupid idiot!

1034
02:19:37,157 --> 02:19:40,369
Look what you've done!
Who is she to you?

1035
02:19:41,745 --> 02:19:44,081
She's my wife!

1036
02:19:47,709 --> 02:19:50,421
Heihachi, hang on!

1037
02:20:29,626 --> 02:20:31,253
You said...

1038
02:20:33,297 --> 02:20:36,300
he'd be a treasure
in hard times.

1039
02:20:38,093 --> 02:20:40,429
The hard times
have only just begun.

1040
02:20:50,564 --> 02:20:51,774
Stop crying!

1041
02:20:52,524 --> 02:20:54,568
Damn fool!

1042
02:20:55,861 --> 02:20:57,488
Stop crying!

1043
02:22:25,409 --> 02:22:27,494
Goddamn!
Here they come!

1044
02:23:40,734 --> 02:23:44,488
Take note:
They have three muskets.

1045
02:24:10,180 --> 02:24:12,307
Twenty riders bound north,
13 south.

1046
02:24:12,516 --> 02:24:14,643
- Muskets?
- Three in all.

1047
02:24:15,853 --> 02:24:18,856
Take the south, and watch out
for those muskets.

1048
02:25:15,204 --> 02:25:17,498
Retreat! Retreat!

1049
02:25:33,138 --> 02:25:36,642
- The 12 headed south have turned east.
- Wasn't that 13?

1050
02:25:36,892 --> 02:25:38,811
An arrow got one of them.

1051
02:25:39,019 --> 02:25:40,562
Good old Gorobei.

1052
02:25:43,357 --> 02:25:46,610
Make sure the eastern bridge is out,
and watch out for --

1053
02:25:46,819 --> 02:25:48,320
The muskets!

1054
02:25:57,412 --> 02:26:00,958
Take the north.
That's where we'll battle it out.

1055
02:26:01,959 --> 02:26:05,379
If you knew that, why didn't
you build a fence there too?

1056
02:26:05,587 --> 02:26:07,965
Every great castle
needs a breach.

1057
02:26:08,173 --> 02:26:12,428
Draw the enemy there and attack.
You can't win by defense alone.

1058
02:26:24,189 --> 02:26:26,316
Use your balls,
if you've got any!

1059
02:26:30,446 --> 02:26:32,948
Take it away, damn it!

1060
02:26:36,493 --> 02:26:39,204
Twelve riders are on the way.
Hurry with the bridge!

1061
02:26:39,455 --> 02:26:42,124
Are you blind?
What do you think we're doing?

1062
02:26:44,084 --> 02:26:46,462
And he said
to watch out for the muskets.

1063
02:26:46,670 --> 02:26:48,630
What kinda idiot
you take me for?

1064
02:26:55,304 --> 02:26:56,638
Where are you going?

1065
02:26:56,847 --> 02:26:59,641
We're looking for Father.
We can't find him anywhere.

1066
02:26:59,975 --> 02:27:04,521
Father intends to die in that barn.
That's what he's always wanted.

1067
02:27:10,277 --> 02:27:12,404
Stubborn old fool!

1068
02:27:12,946 --> 02:27:15,115
Hurry up and get him!

1069
02:27:18,702 --> 02:27:20,746
Get out of our way!

1070
02:27:21,705 --> 02:27:25,042
What are you doing?
Hurry up!

1071
02:27:46,855 --> 02:27:49,149
- On this mountain --
- Twenty riders.

1072
02:27:49,566 --> 02:27:52,152
And 12 to the east.

1073
02:27:52,361 --> 02:27:53,737
Right.

1074
02:28:09,586 --> 02:28:12,673
This won't do.
They're all scared stiff.

1075
02:28:16,552 --> 02:28:18,095
Good! Again!

1076
02:28:19,721 --> 02:28:21,223
Again!

1077
02:28:24,601 --> 02:28:27,771
Shichiroji's at it.
Let's fire ours up too.

1078
02:28:29,314 --> 02:28:30,983
Everybody out here!

1079
02:28:36,280 --> 02:28:38,740
Raise your spears
and give the battle cry.

1080
02:28:43,412 --> 02:28:44,288
Again!

1081
02:28:48,667 --> 02:28:51,587
Damn 'em, listen to that!
We can beat 'em!

1082
02:28:55,507 --> 02:28:58,135
Yohei, what's that look for?
Again!

1083
02:29:03,348 --> 02:29:05,267
Take cover!

1084
02:29:10,022 --> 02:29:11,857
Here they come!

1085
02:29:28,499 --> 02:29:29,917
Goddamn 'em!

1086
02:30:06,203 --> 02:30:09,331
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

1087
02:30:13,710 --> 02:30:15,921
Oh, no, you don't!

1088
02:30:20,717 --> 02:30:22,302
Don't panic!

1089
02:30:31,228 --> 02:30:33,647
Goddamn you!

1090
02:30:37,734 --> 02:30:39,194
They're burning!

1091
02:30:39,611 --> 02:30:41,488
Damn bastards!

1092
02:31:11,310 --> 02:31:14,354
Back to your posts, everyone!

1093
02:31:15,564 --> 02:31:17,232
Dear!

1094
02:31:19,193 --> 02:31:21,904
They're just rickety shacks!

1095
02:31:24,865 --> 02:31:27,826
Everybody, back to your posts!

1096
02:31:39,338 --> 02:31:40,839
Goddamn it!

1097
02:31:42,591 --> 02:31:44,259
You dogs!

1098
02:31:44,593 --> 02:31:47,137
That's the Old Man's house!

1099
02:31:49,723 --> 02:31:52,392
Where's the Old Man?
What about that couple?

1100
02:31:52,893 --> 02:31:55,854
And the little brat?
What the hell's going on?

1101
02:31:58,982 --> 02:32:01,902
Stop!
You can't abandon your post!

1102
02:32:03,862 --> 02:32:05,906
Kikuchiyo, come back!

1103
02:32:08,033 --> 02:32:09,493
Kikuchiyo!

1104
02:32:24,675 --> 02:32:27,469
Where's the Old Man
and your husband?

1105
02:32:37,479 --> 02:32:40,399
She's been speared.
How'd she make it this far?

1106
02:32:46,905 --> 02:32:48,782
Let's go!

1107
02:32:55,372 --> 02:32:57,499
Damn it, what is it now?

1108
02:33:00,711 --> 02:33:03,380
This baby... is me.

1109
02:33:03,881 --> 02:33:06,383
This is just
what happened to me!

1110
02:34:15,202 --> 02:34:17,079
Here we go!

1111
02:34:25,838 --> 02:34:27,881
What the hell?

1112
02:34:42,146 --> 02:34:44,648
What the hell
were you staring at?

1113
02:34:45,816 --> 02:34:47,401
Idiot!

1114
02:35:49,713 --> 02:35:51,757
No one wounded?

1115
02:35:52,174 --> 02:35:54,593
Good.
You did a fine job.

1116
02:35:54,802 --> 02:35:56,428
Fine job!

1117
02:35:59,807 --> 02:36:02,017
Gunpowder!
Take cover!

1118
02:36:12,569 --> 02:36:14,238
Manzo!

1119
02:36:28,043 --> 02:36:29,962
Where were you hit?

1120
02:36:30,504 --> 02:36:33,632
Shino! Shino!
Bring me my daughter.

1121
02:36:34,883 --> 02:36:36,260
Don't bother.

1122
02:36:36,677 --> 02:36:39,555
If this kills you,
you'd die of a fleabite.

1123
02:36:40,806 --> 02:36:43,350
You make a ruckus
over a little scratch

1124
02:36:43,559 --> 02:36:47,396
and blow your daughter's cover
in the process. Nice going!

1125
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:19,011
You don't have
to chase them all down.

1126
02:37:22,473 --> 02:37:24,516
That's far enough.
Well done.

1127
02:37:25,309 --> 02:37:27,186
Who are you?

1128
02:37:29,104 --> 02:37:30,773
Rikichi.

1129
02:37:45,829 --> 02:37:48,290
They've attacked from the east,
west and south

1130
02:37:48,499 --> 02:37:51,460
and run away each time
with their tails between their legs.

1131
02:37:51,668 --> 02:37:53,378
This is the only approach left.

1132
02:37:53,587 --> 02:37:56,173
We don't know
if they'll come tonight,

1133
02:37:56,381 --> 02:37:58,467
but when they do,
they'll mass their forces here.

1134
02:37:58,675 --> 02:38:00,344
Perhaps, but...

1135
02:38:01,053 --> 02:38:03,097
I don't hear a thing.

1136
02:38:16,193 --> 02:38:17,903
Nevertheless,

1137
02:38:18,695 --> 02:38:20,989
this will surely
be the focus of their attack.

1138
02:38:21,448 --> 02:38:23,367
I'll prove it to you in a minute.

1139
02:39:07,411 --> 02:39:08,746
Good work.

1140
02:39:08,912 --> 02:39:11,957
Now poke that scarecrow out
from behind those trees.

1141
02:39:46,533 --> 02:39:49,578
I'd say tomorrow morning

1142
02:39:49,953 --> 02:39:52,414
they'll attack us here
with everything they've got.

1143
02:39:52,623 --> 02:39:55,501
And we'll let them in.

1144
02:39:59,463 --> 02:40:02,591
Don't worry.
I mean we'll let one in.

1145
02:40:03,675 --> 02:40:05,636
Two at most.

1146
02:40:06,637 --> 02:40:10,307
Once they're in,
we form a wall again with our spears.

1147
02:40:11,058 --> 02:40:13,894
The one or two who get in
are as good as dead.

1148
02:40:14,103 --> 02:40:16,105
We can cook 'em up
any way we want.

1149
02:40:18,440 --> 02:40:22,986
We'll pick them off patiently,
one by one, until the final showdown.

1150
02:40:23,195 --> 02:40:25,197
Those muskets worry me.

1151
02:40:25,405 --> 02:40:27,533
If only we could
get one of them.

1152
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:33,455
I'll go.
I swear I'll get one!

1153
02:40:33,664 --> 02:40:36,583
No. You're looking to die.
I'll go.

1154
02:41:29,762 --> 02:41:31,638
Footsteps! Listen!

1155
02:41:31,847 --> 02:41:35,058
That's enough.
Get some rest.

1156
02:41:35,267 --> 02:41:38,228
It's true! I hear them!
Listen.

1157
02:41:38,437 --> 02:41:40,522
I said enough.

1158
02:41:41,440 --> 02:41:44,526
You're exhausted.
Get some rest.

1159
02:41:47,321 --> 02:41:48,989
I hear them.

1160
02:42:17,184 --> 02:42:18,894
Two more down.

1161
02:42:53,929 --> 02:42:55,097
What is it?

1162
02:42:58,225 --> 02:43:02,271
State your business.
I'm going to get some sleep.

1163
02:43:03,814 --> 02:43:07,276
You are a magnificent person.

1164
02:43:11,655 --> 02:43:15,701
I've wanted to tell you so
for some time.

1165
02:43:41,727 --> 02:43:43,437
They're here.

1166
02:43:47,566 --> 02:43:49,526
We'll let one in.

1167
02:43:52,362 --> 02:43:54,281
We're letting one in!

1168
02:44:01,747 --> 02:44:06,210
Remember, after the first one's in,
jump out with your spears.

1169
02:44:25,145 --> 02:44:26,355
Here they come.

1170
02:45:02,349 --> 02:45:04,059
Step aside!

1171
02:45:06,645 --> 02:45:08,147
Good work.

1172
02:45:15,904 --> 02:45:18,907
What's wrong?
You did well.

1173
02:45:19,450 --> 02:45:21,368
Here he comes!
Scatter!

1174
02:45:38,969 --> 02:45:41,138
Fall back! Fall back!

1175
02:45:46,810 --> 02:45:48,854
After them!

1176
02:45:57,196 --> 02:45:58,822
Another on the way!

1177
02:47:41,175 --> 02:47:42,885
Here he comes.

1178
02:47:59,151 --> 02:48:00,903
Watch this!

1179
02:48:06,909 --> 02:48:09,578
Having fun
with your horsey?

1180
02:48:31,391 --> 02:48:35,896
They've stopped.
Won't fall for that trick again, eh?

1181
02:48:44,863 --> 02:48:47,991
They're all wimps!
Who's scared of bandits anyway?

1182
02:48:54,957 --> 02:49:00,170
That little skirmish just cost them four.
Kyuzo got two last night.

1183
02:49:16,812 --> 02:49:19,022
That man is a true samurai.

1184
02:49:19,398 --> 02:49:22,025
He's fearless,
his swordsmanship is amazing,

1185
02:49:22,234 --> 02:49:23,902
and yet he's kind too.

1186
02:49:24,111 --> 02:49:27,781
He never once boasted
about capturing that musket.

1187
02:49:28,240 --> 02:49:32,703
He walked into a forest filled with bandits
as if on a mushroom hunt.

1188
02:49:34,121 --> 02:49:38,375
Fascinating.
I'm not bored at all, I swear.

1189
02:49:56,268 --> 02:49:58,145
Hey, Yohei.

1190
02:49:59,062 --> 02:50:00,564
Take over for me.

1191
02:50:03,734 --> 02:50:06,695
What's that face for?

1192
02:50:06,904 --> 02:50:09,031
There's no danger here now.

1193
02:50:10,699 --> 02:50:12,826
You make a great scarecrow.

1194
02:51:44,334 --> 02:51:45,586
Hear me good!

1195
02:51:46,670 --> 02:51:49,047
If anybody else turns yellow --

1196
02:51:55,262 --> 02:51:56,597
Out of my way!

1197
02:53:20,139 --> 02:53:21,348
Hey!

1198
02:53:25,144 --> 02:53:26,270
How's it goin'?

1199
02:53:26,478 --> 02:53:28,480
Man, they're a pain.

1200
02:53:28,814 --> 02:53:30,899
Won't be long now.

1201
02:53:31,358 --> 02:53:34,570
Everything's upside down.

1202
02:53:34,778 --> 02:53:38,574
They burn us out,
and we starve like farmers.

1203
02:53:39,450 --> 02:53:42,244
Quit your moaning.
There are better times ahead.

1204
02:53:42,453 --> 02:53:44,747
Do your part, man.

1205
02:54:24,495 --> 02:54:26,622
Hey, it's me!

1206
02:54:33,962 --> 02:54:35,631
Serves you right, you dogs!

1207
02:54:35,839 --> 02:54:36,840
Fool!

1208
02:54:38,008 --> 02:54:40,010
Why did you leave your post?

1209
02:54:40,219 --> 02:54:41,553
Just look at this!

1210
02:54:41,762 --> 02:54:45,349
Don't scold me, man.
My post is fine.

1211
02:54:46,225 --> 02:54:49,728
There's nothing heroic
about selfishly grabbing for glory.

1212
02:54:49,937 --> 02:54:54,108
Listen to me:
War is not fought alone!

1213
02:55:04,535 --> 02:55:07,496
Gorobei and Kyuzo,
guard this post!

1214
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,002
Let no one pass!

1215
02:57:23,963 --> 02:57:26,716
Stop, you asses!

1216
02:57:26,924 --> 02:57:28,593
Damn you!

1217
02:57:29,260 --> 02:57:31,220
Damn it! Two made it in!

1218
02:57:46,944 --> 02:57:49,947
Goddamn it!

1219
02:57:50,698 --> 02:57:52,241
Where's Yohei?

1220
02:58:32,281 --> 02:58:33,574
Yohei!

1221
02:58:35,243 --> 02:58:36,577
Yohei!

1222
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:40,248
I defended my post.

1223
02:58:40,456 --> 02:58:43,084
Don't give up, Yohei!

1224
02:58:46,462 --> 02:58:48,297
Go ahead, shoot me!

1225
02:59:26,335 --> 02:59:28,045
Shichiroji, take over!

1226
02:59:39,348 --> 02:59:41,184
Gorobei!

1227
02:59:50,860 --> 02:59:52,862
Gorobei!

1228
03:00:44,831 --> 03:00:47,041
Just 13 left.

1229
03:00:47,708 --> 03:00:49,710
But these last seven...

1230
03:00:51,003 --> 03:00:53,047
came at a steep price.

1231
03:01:14,277 --> 03:01:16,946
How are you? Tired?

1232
03:01:18,906 --> 03:01:22,785
Poor man.
You've lost a lot of weight.

1233
03:01:26,998 --> 03:01:29,500
I'll go throw
some water on my face.

1234
03:01:40,136 --> 03:01:42,763
<i>Next time they come,
we fight to the finish.</i>

1235
03:01:42,972 --> 03:01:47,226
It's better we fight it out
before we're spent.

1236
03:01:47,477 --> 03:01:51,022
When do you think
they'll attack?

1237
03:01:52,482 --> 03:01:55,443
They're exhausted too,
and a few are wounded.

1238
03:01:55,902 --> 03:01:57,945
They won't come tonight.

1239
03:01:58,154 --> 03:02:03,367
But they have no food,
and their ranks are splitting.

1240
03:02:04,327 --> 03:02:06,370
They can't afford
to dawdle either.

1241
03:02:06,662 --> 03:02:12,794
I say they'll come at us like hell
tomorrow morning.

1242
03:02:14,170 --> 03:02:15,797
Katsushiro.

1243
03:02:35,358 --> 03:02:36,818
An order from above.

1244
03:02:37,026 --> 03:02:40,154
Place two on watch
and let the rest sleep.

1245
03:02:40,863 --> 03:02:44,826
The men may visit their families
one at a time.

1246
03:02:46,702 --> 03:02:48,162
So tomorrow's the showdown?

1247
03:02:50,248 --> 03:02:52,416
Yes.
Please carry out the order.

1248
03:02:59,173 --> 03:03:02,927
You all heard what he just said.

1249
03:03:06,973 --> 03:03:09,350
I'll stand guard.

1250
03:03:10,017 --> 03:03:11,853
The rest of you sleep.

1251
03:03:12,895 --> 03:03:16,065
Manzo...

1252
03:03:16,899 --> 03:03:18,901
you go home first.

1253
03:03:19,360 --> 03:03:21,696
Take a good look
at your daughter --

1254
03:03:22,572 --> 03:03:24,782
I mean, your son.

1255
03:03:33,833 --> 03:03:35,084
I told them.

1256
03:03:35,293 --> 03:03:37,420
All right. Get some rest.

1257
03:03:41,507 --> 03:03:43,801
Katsushiro.

1258
03:03:44,760 --> 03:03:46,304
How was Kikuchiyo?

1259
03:03:46,512 --> 03:03:49,557
Still beside the grave.

1260
03:03:49,849 --> 03:03:51,058
I see.

1261
03:05:04,465 --> 03:05:07,260
Are we all going
to die tomorrow?

1262
03:05:07,468 --> 03:05:10,513
There's no way to know.

1263
03:05:11,180 --> 03:05:13,683
But we might!

1264
03:05:35,955 --> 03:05:37,331
Shino.

1265
03:05:37,999 --> 03:05:39,625
Where's Shino?

1266
03:05:45,339 --> 03:05:46,841
Anyone seen Shino?

1267
03:06:21,375 --> 03:06:23,920
Sake, eh?
Where'd you find it?

1268
03:06:39,268 --> 03:06:42,230
I see. They have stockpiles,
just like Kikuchiyo said,

1269
03:06:42,438 --> 03:06:44,440
and tonight it all comes out.

1270
03:06:53,866 --> 03:06:56,410
I think I'll help myself.

1271
03:07:00,206 --> 03:07:01,707
Shino!

1272
03:07:27,567 --> 03:07:30,611
Here's some sake.
Drink up and get some sleep.

1273
03:07:35,908 --> 03:07:40,121
This is hardly like you.
You must rest for the battle tomorrow.

1274
03:07:51,757 --> 03:07:53,801
Shino!

1275
03:08:58,991 --> 03:09:00,827
<i>You tramp!</i>

1276
03:09:10,336 --> 03:09:13,381
You wench!

1277
03:09:17,301 --> 03:09:19,428
Stop this brutality!

1278
03:09:19,637 --> 03:09:23,891
What the hell's a farmer girl
doing with a samurai?

1279
03:09:49,417 --> 03:09:51,043
You slut!

1280
03:10:01,220 --> 03:10:02,722
Manzo.

1281
03:10:03,639 --> 03:10:06,142
Is this your daughter?

1282
03:10:12,648 --> 03:10:14,442
Tell me what happened.

1283
03:10:14,650 --> 03:10:18,988
You mentioned a samurai.
Who was it?

1284
03:10:20,615 --> 03:10:22,074
Manzo!

1285
03:10:31,834 --> 03:10:33,669
Manzo, say something.

1286
03:10:34,796 --> 03:10:36,297
Speak!

1287
03:11:08,704 --> 03:11:10,873
Are you Shino?

1288
03:11:30,143 --> 03:11:33,312
Manzo, don't be angry.

1289
03:11:34,814 --> 03:11:37,859
When the dawn threatens
our very lives,

1290
03:11:38,067 --> 03:11:41,362
the weight of it
makes us all a little reckless.

1291
03:11:47,243 --> 03:11:49,704
On the eve of decisive battles...

1292
03:11:51,330 --> 03:11:54,041
this often happens,
even inside castles.

1293
03:11:56,919 --> 03:12:00,965
Remember what it was to be young.
You can't blame them.

1294
03:12:01,924 --> 03:12:04,010
I can't forgive them.

1295
03:12:04,260 --> 03:12:07,388
I can't stand by when my only daughter
has been made damaged goods.

1296
03:12:22,028 --> 03:12:26,616
What's wrong with two people in love?
It's not like bandits took her!

1297
03:13:59,041 --> 03:14:03,296
They're wound up tight.
We need to loosen them up.

1298
03:14:11,387 --> 03:14:14,640
Everyone, the final battle
is here at last.

1299
03:14:17,685 --> 03:14:21,856
By the way, Katsushiro,
we expect much of you today.

1300
03:14:23,691 --> 03:14:26,694
As of last night,
you became a real man.

1301
03:14:44,754 --> 03:14:46,297
Hey!

1302
03:14:49,258 --> 03:14:52,386
Where's that fighting spirit?

1303
03:14:54,180 --> 03:14:57,725
You'll never win
with such long faces!

1304
03:15:11,322 --> 03:15:13,407
Kikuchiyo, what are you up to?

1305
03:15:13,616 --> 03:15:15,910
I can't kill five
with just one blade.

1306
03:15:31,634 --> 03:15:33,553
There are 13 left.

1307
03:15:34,762 --> 03:15:38,683
We'll let them all in.

1308
03:15:40,309 --> 03:15:42,687
Once they pass this point,

1309
03:15:43,229 --> 03:15:47,066
we close in from all sides
at the crossing.

1310
03:15:49,986 --> 03:15:54,115
Everything's riding
on this battle!

1311
03:16:24,437 --> 03:16:26,647
Here they come!

1312
03:16:50,004 --> 03:16:52,173
Here they come!

1313
03:17:16,697 --> 03:17:18,866
Shichiroji and Katsushiro,
go west!

1314
03:17:19,158 --> 03:17:21,410
Kyuzo, Kikuchiyo, east!

1315
03:19:02,929 --> 03:19:05,848
Katsushiro! Rikichi!

1316
03:19:06,057 --> 03:19:08,684
East! Go east!

1317
03:19:08,893 --> 03:19:10,728
East!

1318
03:19:27,829 --> 03:19:29,580
Shut up!

1319
03:19:30,039 --> 03:19:32,250
Scream and you're dead!

1320
03:20:19,672 --> 03:20:20,840
We did it!

1321
03:20:21,048 --> 03:20:22,341
We did it!

1322
03:20:22,550 --> 03:20:25,261
Head east!

1323
03:20:40,610 --> 03:20:42,987
Katsushiro, pull back!

1324
03:20:45,531 --> 03:20:47,742
Damn you!

1325
03:20:49,494 --> 03:20:50,912
Kikuchiyo!

1326
03:21:27,115 --> 03:21:29,200
Kikuchiyo!

1327
03:21:39,627 --> 03:21:42,672
Where are the bandits?

1328
03:21:42,880 --> 03:21:44,841
They're all dead!

1329
03:22:03,192 --> 03:22:05,987
Once more we survive.

1330
03:25:44,205 --> 03:25:47,875
In the end,
we lost this battle too.

1331
03:25:48,793 --> 03:25:50,002
What?

1332
03:25:50,878 --> 03:25:52,463
I mean,

1333
03:25:52,880 --> 03:25:55,424
the victory belongs
to those peasants.

1334
03:25:56,759 --> 03:25:58,553
Not to us.

1335
03:26:27,790 --> 03:26:32,670
THE END
