1
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,200
<i>Dream, little one</i>

2
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,245
<i>Dream</i>

3
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,624
<i>Dream, my little one</i>

4
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,627
<i>Dream</i>

5
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,882
<i>Though the hunter</i>

6
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:34,427
<i>In the night</i>

7
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,806
<i>Fills your childish heart</i>

8
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,601
<i>With fright</i>

9
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,396
<i>Fear is only</i>

10
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,983
<i>A dream</i>

11
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:54,864
<i>So dream, little one</i>

12
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,451
<i>Dream</i>

13
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,789
Now, you remember, children,
how I told you last Sunday...

14
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,167
about the good Lord going up into he mountain
and talking to the people...

15
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,586
and how he said,
"Blessed are the pure in heart...

16
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,713
for they shall see God..."

17
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,050
and how he said that King Solomon
in all his glory...

18
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,969
was not as beautiful
as the lilies of the field?

19
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,723
And I know you won't forget,
"Judge not lest ye be judged..."

20
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,017
because I explained that to you.

21
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,937
And then the good Lord went on to say...

22
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,774
"Beware of false prophets...

23
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,735
<i>"which come to you in sheep's clothing...</i>

24
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,155
<i>"but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</i>

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,200
<i>Ye shall know them by their fruits."</i>

26
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,246
Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,
35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60...

27
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,208
65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100!

28
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,293
Here I come, ready or not!

29
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,631
What's wrong?

30
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,758
Hey! Hey!

31
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,063
<i>"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit.</i>

32
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,692
<i>"Neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit.</i>

33
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,404
<i>Wherefore, by their fruits
ye shall know them."</i>

34
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:22,118
Well, now, what's it to be, Lord?

35
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,537
Another widow?

36
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,331
How many has it been? Six?

37
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,792
Twelve?

38
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,794
I disremember.

39
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,843
You say the word, Lord,
I'm on my way.

40
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,646
You always send me money
to go forth and preach your word.

41
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,902
A widow with a little wad of bills
hid away in a sugar bowl.

42
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,415
Lord, I am tired.

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,835
Sometimes I wonder
if you really understand.

44
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,215
Not that you mind the killings.
Your Book is full of killings.

45
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,428
But there are things you do hate, Lord.

46
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,847
Perfume-smellin' things...

47
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:28,768
lacy things, things with curly hair.

48
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,730
There are too many of them.

49
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,816
You can't kill a world.

50
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,070
You driving a touring car
with a Moundsville license?

51
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,615
Harry Powell, for the theft
of that touring car...

52
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,201
you will spend 30 days
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

53
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,286
Uh, Preacher Harry Powell.

54
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,581
A car thief, picked up where you were-

55
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,834
a man of God?

56
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,836
Harry Powell.

57
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,484
Hold Miss Jenny still.

58
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,611
Stand still, Miss Jenny!

59
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,949
There. What's so hard about that?

60
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,872
Daddy!

61
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,088
- Where's your mom?
- Out shoppin'.

62
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,467
- You're bleedin', Dad.
- Listen to me, John.

63
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,677
This money here-
we gotta hide it before they get to me.

64
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,013
There's close to $10,000. Where?

65
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,724
Under a rock in the smokehouse?
No, no.

66
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,727
Under the bricks in the grape arbor?
No, no. They'd dig for it.

67
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,481
Sure. That's the place.

68
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,989
- That's him.
- He probably still has that gun.

69
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,325
Listen to me, Son.
You've gotta swear.

70
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,078
Swear means promise.
First, swear you'll take care of little Pearl.

71
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,080
Guard her with your life, boy.

72
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,999
Then swear you won't never tell
where the money's hid, not even your mom.

73
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,417
- Yes, Dad.
- You understand?

74
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,961
- Not even her?
- You got common sense. She ain't.

75
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,255
When you grow up,
that money will belong to you.

76
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,175
Now stand up straight and look me in the eye.
Raise your right hand.

77
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,427
Now swear-
"I'll guard Pearl with my life."

78
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,596
I will guard Pearl with my life.

79
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,891
- "And I won't never tell about the money."
- And I won't never tell about the money.

80
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,229
And you, Pearl- you swear too.

81
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,358
Ben Harper.

82
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,445
I'm goin' now, children. Good-bye.

83
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,781
Drop that gun, Harper.
We don't want the kids hurt.

84
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,951
Just mind what you swore, Son.
Mind, boy.

85
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,038
Don't.

86
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,624
Don't!

87
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,211
Dad.

88
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,652
Ben Harper, it is the sentence of this court...

89
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,780
that for the murder
of Ed Smiley and Corey South...

90
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,783
you be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

91
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,411
And may God have mercy on your soul.

92
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,006
I got you all buffaloed.

93
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,301
Ain't none of you gonna get it outta me.
None of you.

94
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,386
Where, Ben? Where?

95
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,142
- Where?
- "And a little child shall lead them."

96
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,728
Now, come on, boy. Tell me.

97
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,067
Ben, I'm a man of God.

98
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,196
- Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep.
- No, Ben. No.

99
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,364
What'd I say?
What? What? What? What?

100
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,450
You was quotin' the Scripture, Ben.

101
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,204
You said, "And a little child shall lead them."

102
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:09,256
- You killed two men, Ben Harper.
- That's right, Preacher.

103
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,759
I robbed that bank
'cause I got tired of seein'...

104
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,388
children roamin' the woodlands
without food...

105
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,974
children roamin' the highways
in this here depression...

106
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,979
children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies
and junk heaps.

107
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,316
And I promised myself I'd never see the day
when my young 'uns would want.

108
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,860
With that $10,000,
I could build a tabernacle...

109
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,239
make that Wheeling Island tabernacle
look like a chicken house.

110
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,699
Will you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?

111
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,453
Think of it, Ben-
with that cursed, bloodied gold.

112
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,665
How come you got that stick knife
hid up in your bed blankets, Preacher?

113
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,418
The Lord blinded mine enemies
when they brought me in this evil place.

114
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,630
I smuggled it in right
under the noses of them guards.

115
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:52,549
I come not with peace...

116
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,219
but with a sword.

117
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,096
You, Preacher?

118
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,349
This sword has served me through
many an evil time, Ben Harper.

119
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,439
What religion you profess, Preacher?

120
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,693
The religion the Almighty and me
worked out betwixt us.

121
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,737
I'll bet.

122
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,493
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.

123
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,495
Keep talkin', Preacher.

124
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,831
If you was to let that money
serve the Lord's purpose...

125
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,708
he might feel kindly turned towards you.

126
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,209
Keep talkin', Preacher.

127
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,296
Now, don't you think the Lord
might change his mind if you was to-

128
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,559
Lord...

129
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,603
you sure knowed what you was doin'...

130
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,316
when you put me in this very cell
at this very time.

131
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,570
A man with $10,000 hid somewhere...

132
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,073
and a widow in the makin'.

133
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,050
- Any trouble?
- No.

134
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,469
He was a cool one, that Harper.
Never broke.

135
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,679
He carried on some, kicked.

136
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,723
They say he left a wife and two kids.

137
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,767
I never heard.

138
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,854
- He never told about the money?
- No.

139
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,231
What do you figure he done with it?

140
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,650
He took the secret with him
when I dropped him.

141
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,406
That you, Bart? Supper's waitin'.

142
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:58,342
Mother, sometimes I think it might be better
if I was to quit my job as guard.

143
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,636
You're always this way
when there's a hangin'.

144
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,721
You never have to be there.

145
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,559
Sometimes I wish
I was back in the mine.

146
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,021
And leave me a widow
after another blast like the one in '24?

147
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,107
Not on your life, old mister.

148
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,839
<i>See what the hangman done</i>

149
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,761
<i>See what the hangman done</i>

150
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,099
<i>See the robber swing</i>

151
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,692
<i>And now my song is done</i>

152
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,485
<i>See what the hangman done</i>

153
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,614
<i>See the robber swing</i>

154
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,089
Are you going to buy it, John?

155
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,594
So your mommy's keepin' you
out of school these days.

156
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,472
How is your poor, poor mother?

157
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,640
She's at Spoon's ice cream parlor.

158
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,020
Say, did they ever find out what your father done
with all that money he stole?

159
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,442
Pearl and me, we have to go.

160
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,658
- You better not sing that song.
- Why?

161
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,660
'Cause you're too little.

162
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,830
Can we get some candy?

163
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,418
No.

164
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,674
Willa Harper, there are certain
plain facts of life that adds up...

165
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,511
just like two plus two makes four,
and one of them is this-

166
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,472
No woman is able to raise
growin' youngsters alone.

167
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,807
The Lord meant that job for two.

168
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,519
Icey, I just don't want a husband.

169
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,238
Ain't a question of wantin' or not wantin'.
You're no spring chicken.

170
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,323
You're a grown woman
with two little young 'uns.

171
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,034
It's a man you need in the house,
Willa Harper.

172
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,800
Tell me a story, John.

173
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:50,055
Well, once upon a time...

174
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,266
there was a rich king...

175
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,435
who had himself a son and a daughter.

176
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,982
They all lived in a castle over in Africa.

177
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,906
Then one day this king
got taken away by some bad men.

178
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,076
And before he got took off...

179
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,997
he told his son to kill anyone
who tried to steal his gold.

180
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,168
And before long,
the bad men came back and-

181
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,645
<i>Leaning</i>

182
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,107
- <i>Leaning</i>
- Just a man.

183
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,902
Good night, Pearl. Sleep tight
and don't let the bedbugs bite.

184
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,697
Good night, Miss Jenny.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

185
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:57,080
<i>Leaning</i>

186
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,625
<i>Leaning on</i>

187
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:04,338
<i>The everlasting arms</i>

188
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:49,508
She don't put in Cresap's Landin' no more,
but she still blows as she passes.

189
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,014
Come on in and have a cup of coffee, boy.

190
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,850
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.

191
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,688
Ain't nobody gonna neither
as long as Uncle Birdie's around.

192
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,694
First day my joints is limber enough,
I'll haul her out and give her a good caulkin'.

193
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,699
Ain't seen ya in a coon's age, boy.

194
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,701
I've been mindin' Pearl.

195
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,870
Shucks. Ain't it a caution what a woman
will load onto a man's back...

196
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,156
when he ain't lookin'?

197
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:36,596
Excuse me, cap, while I-
while I sweeten my coffee.

198
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:51,027
Dead and gone these 25 year
and never takes her eyes off me.

199
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:58,410
Man of my years needs a little snort
in the mornin' to heat the boilers.

200
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,246
Yeah.

201
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,332
I was talkin' to this stranger
up at the boardinghouse.

202
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,419
- He knowed your dad.
- Where'd he know Dad?

203
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,006
I'll not hide it from you, boy.
He knowed him in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

204
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,425
I gotta go now, Uncle Birdie.

205
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,761
Well, you just got here, boy.

206
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,682
I told Mom I'd be back to Spoon's for Pearl.

207
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,875
"God works in a mysterious way,
his wonders to perform."

208
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:51,046
Yes, I was with brother Harper
right up to the end.

209
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,006
Now that I'm no longer employed
by the penitentiary...

210
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,926
it is my joy to bring this small comfort
to his loved ones.

211
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,553
It's a mighty good man
would go out of his way...

212
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,681
to bring a word of cheer
to a grievin' widow.

213
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,769
- So you ain't with the state no more?
- No, brother. I resigned only yesterday.

214
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,397
The heartrendin' spectacle of them poor men
was just too much for me.

215
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,068
Ah, little lad, you're starin' at my fingers.

216
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,988
Would you like me to tell you
the little story of right hand, left hand...

217
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,074
the story of good and evil?

218
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,118
H-A-T-E.

219
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,496
It was with this left hand
that old brother Cain...

220
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,082
struck the blow that laid his brother low.

221
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,417
L-O-V-E.

222
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,169
You see these fingers, dear hearts?

223
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:34,172
These fingers has veins
that run straight to the soul of man.

224
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:37,133
The right hand, friends-
the hand of love.

225
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,177
Now watch and I'll show you
the story of life.

226
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:44,266
These fingers, dear hearts, is always a-warrin'
and a-tuggin', one again' t'other.

227
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,352
Now watch 'em.

228
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,354
Old brother left hand.

229
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,439
Left hand hate's a-fightin'.

230
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,192
And it looks like love's a goner.

231
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,028
But wait a minute. Wait a minute.

232
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,489
Hot dog! Love's a-winnin'.

233
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,867
Yes, sirree!

234
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,869
It's love that won.

235
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,122
And old left hand hate
is down for the count.

236
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,918
I never heard it better told.

237
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,714
I wish every soul in this community
could get the benefit.

238
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:19,885
Oh, you've just got to stay
for our picnic Sunday.

239
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,888
No, I must wend my way downriver
on the Lord's business.

240
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,932
You ain't leaving' in no hurry
if we can help it.

241
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,936
John, mind your manners.
Take that look off your face. Act nice.

242
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,398
Why, he don't mean no impudence,
do you, boy?

243
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,191
Do ya, boy?

244
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,237
Ah, many's the time poor brother Ben
told me about these young 'uns.

245
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,739
What'd he tell ya?

246
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,367
Why, he told me what fine little lambs
you and your sister both was.

247
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,994
Is that all?

248
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:50,540
Why, no, boy.
He told me lots and lots of things.

249
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,251
- Nice things, boy.
- Thank you.

250
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,340
My, that fudge smells yummy.

251
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,343
It's for the picnic.

252
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:06,181
And you don't get a smidgen of my fudge
unless you stay for the picnic.

253
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,433
<i>Bringing in the sheaves</i>

254
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,644
<i>Bringing in the sheaves</i>

255
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:15,023
<i>We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves</i>

256
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:19,527
<i>Sowing in the morning
Sowing seeds of kindness</i>

257
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:23,949
<i>Sowing in the noontide
and the dewy eve</i>

258
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:28,411
<i>Waiting for the harvest
and the time of reaping</i>

259
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:33,208
<i>We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves</i>

260
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,628
<i>Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves</i>

261
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:41,800
<i>We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves</i>

262
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:46,179
<i>Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves</i>

263
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,809
<i>We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves</i>

264
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,478
Don't he have the grandest singin' voice?

265
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,439
John! Pearl!
Run along and play, you two.

266
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,483
- Where?
- Down by the river! My goodness.

267
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,069
<i>Bringing in the sheaves</i>

268
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,989
That feller's just achin' to settle down
with some nice woman...

269
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,991
and make a home for himself.

270
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,535
Icey, it's awful soon after Ben's passing.

271
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,871
If ever I saw a sign from heaven.

272
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,125
- John don't like him much.
- Pearl dotes on him.

273
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,585
The boy worries me.

274
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,339
I know it's silly, but it's like
there's somethin' still between him and his dad.

275
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,967
What he needs is a dose of salts.

276
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,052
- No, there's somethin' else.
- What?

277
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,723
- The money.
- I declare, Willa Harper.

278
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,434
You'll let that money haunt you
to your grave.

279
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,811
Icey, I would love to be satisfied...

280
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,522
that Harry Powell don't think
I got that money hid somewhere.

281
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,525
You come right out
and ask that man of God.

282
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,696
Mr. Powell!
Clear that evil mud out of your soul.

283
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,783
John! Pearl!
Come along here and get some fudge.

284
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,369
- I don't want no fudge.
- You do what you're told!

285
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:54,706
- You go set down by the river.
- Oh, Icey, I'm a sight.

286
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,125
Get along with you.

287
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,465
You!

288
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,718
That young lady better look sharp...

289
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,889
or some smart sister between here and Captina
is gonna snap him up right from under her nose.

290
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,225
She's not the only fish in the river.
Now, you two stay put.

291
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,227
Shilly-shallying around.

292
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,396
A husband's one piece of store goods
you never know...

293
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,099
till you get it home and take the paper off.

294
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:25,904
Did Ben Harper ever tell you
what he done with the money he stole?

295
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,823
My dear child, don't you know?

296
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,410
She's moonin' about Ben Harper.

297
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,829
That wasn't love.
That was just flapdoodle.

298
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,248
Have some fudge, lambs.

299
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,292
When you've been married
to a man 40 years...

300
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,878
you know all that don't amount
to a hill of beans.

301
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,963
I've been married to my Walt that long...

302
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:49,010
and I swear, in all that time,
I just lie there thinkin' about my canning.

303
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,850
John!

304
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,114
A woman's a fool to marry for that.
That's somethin' for a man.

305
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,866
The good Lord never meant
for a decent woman to want that.

306
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,202
Not really want it.

307
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,523
It's all just a fake and a pipe dream.

308
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,960
John, Mr. Powell has something to tell you.

309
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:29,300
Well, John, the night before your father died...

310
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,886
he told me what he did with that money.

311
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,473
That money's at the bottom of the river...

312
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,976
wrapped around a 12-pound cobblestone.

313
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,813
Thank you, Harry.

314
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,650
I feel clean now.

315
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,403
My whole body's just a-quivering with cleanness.

316
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,660
John, come here.

317
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,745
Your tie is crooked.

318
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:12,177
<i>'Twas down at Cresap's Landin'</i>

319
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,722
<i>Along the river shore</i>

320
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:19,184
<i>Birdie Steptoe was a pilot</i>

321
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,228
<i>In the good old days of yore</i>

322
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:26,691
<i>Now he sets in his old wharf boat</i>

323
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,444
<i>All the big boats heave a sigh</i>

324
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,614
- When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
- Can't hear you, boy!

325
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:36,075
<i>They blow for Uncle Birdie</i>

326
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,912
<i>And the times</i>

327
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:42,207
<i>That ere gone by</i>

328
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,042
When'll the skiff be ready?

329
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,086
Have her ready inside a week.
Then we'll go fishing.

330
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,715
- How's your ma?
- Oh, she's all right.

331
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,884
- How's your sister, Pearl?
- Just fine.

332
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,054
- You leavin', boy?
- Yep. Gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.

333
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,015
Well, good night, boy.
Come again anytime.

334
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:01,059
And mind, boy...

335
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,229
I'll have your pa's skiff shipshape
inside a week.

336
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,635
Somebody there?

337
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,689
Anybody there?

338
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,902
Anybody here?

339
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,904
Good evenin', John.

340
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,118
I had a little talk
with your mother tonight, John...

341
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:04,539
and your mother decided it might be best for me
to let you know the news.

342
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:10,253
Your mother told me she wanted me
to be a daddy to you and your sister.

343
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,338
We're gonna get married, boy.

344
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,634
Did you hear what I said, boy?

345
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,553
Married.

346
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,515
We're goin' to Sisterville tomorrow,
and when we get back-

347
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,352
You ain't my dad.
You'll never be my dad.

348
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:29,981
When we get back,
we're all going to be friends...

349
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,942
and share our fortunes together, John.

350
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:36,404
You think you can make me tell!
But I won't! I won't! I won't!

351
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,869
- Tell me what, boy?
- Nothin'.

352
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,414
We're not keeping secrets from each other,
are we, little lad?

353
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,708
No, no.

354
00:27:50,392 --> 00:27:51,794
Well, no matter.

355
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,423
We've got a long time together, boy.

356
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,350
Wave your hands. Great sakes.

357
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,269
Now, you wait here
while I get your night things.

358
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,535
Now can I tell?

359
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,489
When Mr. Powell's our daddy,
then can I tell him about-

360
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,532
- You swore, Pearl.
- John, don't.

361
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,701
You promised Dad you wouldn't tell.

362
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,788
I love Mr. Powell lots and lots, John.

363
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,154
Men.

364
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,086
Harry?

365
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,881
Fix that window shade.

366
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,352
- Harry?
- I was praying.

367
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:37,275
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I- I thought-

368
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,319
You thought, Willa,
that the moment you walked in that door...

369
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,573
I'd start to pawin' you
in that abominable way...

370
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,242
that men are supposed to do
on their weddin' night.

371
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,370
- Ain't that right now?
- No, no, no.

372
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,499
I think it's time we made one thing
perfectly clear, Willa.

373
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:57,920
Marriage to me represents a blending
of two spirits in the sight of heaven.

374
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,726
Get up, Willa.

375
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,063
- Harry, what-
- Get up.

376
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,487
Now, go look at yourself
yonder in that mirror.

377
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,574
Do as I say.

378
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,547
Look at yourself.

379
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,427
What do you see, girl?

380
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,721
You see the body of a woman-

381
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,682
the temple of creation and motherhood.

382
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,894
You see the flesh of Eve
that man since Adam has profaned.

383
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,147
That body was meant for begettin' children.

384
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,942
It was not meant for the lust of men.

385
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,196
Do you want more children, Willa?

386
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,948
I-

387
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,616
No.

388
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,869
It's the business of this marriage
to mind those two you have now...

389
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,913
not to beget more.

390
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,498
Yes.

391
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,801
All right, you can get in bed now
and stop shiverin'.

392
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,305
Help me to get clean...

393
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,559
so I can be what Harry
wants me to be.

394
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:44,860
Meanest, orneriest, sneakingest critter
in the whole river, boy.

395
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,862
A gar.

396
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,741
- Here are your can of hooks, Uncle Birdie.
- Boy.

397
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:54,370
Ain't a hook in the land
strong enough to land Mr. Gar.

398
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,957
What a feller needs is mother wit
and a horsehair.

399
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,335
Golly. Won't it bust it, Uncle Birdie?

400
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,589
Nah, a horsehair will hold
a lumpin' whale.

401
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,174
- You mind my cussin', boy?
- No.

402
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:11,137
Well, the reason I ask,
your step-pa bein' a preacher and all-

403
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,143
Never was much of a one
for preachers my own self.

404
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,187
I don't know what's wrong
up at your house...

405
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,024
but always remember, cap...

406
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,693
if you're ever in trouble,
holler and come a-runnin'.

407
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,696
Uncle Birdie's your friend.

408
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:38,164
There! There, you slimy, snag-toothed,
bait-stealin' so-and-so!

409
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,499
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen!

410
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,084
Amen!

411
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,420
- You have all sinned.
- Yes! Yes!

412
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,673
Which one of you can say,
as I can say...

413
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,044
that you drove a good man to murder?

414
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:55,056
Because I kept a-houndin' him for perfume...

415
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,308
and clothes and face paint!

416
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:01,312
And he slew two human beings!

417
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:04,857
And he come to me, and he said...

418
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:09,945
"Take this money and buy yourself
the clothes and the paint!"

419
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,740
- Yes! Yes!
- But, brethren-

420
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:16,786
Brethren, that's where the Lord stepped in!

421
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,456
- That's where the Lord stepped in!
- Yes!

422
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,586
"Ye," said the Lord to that man...

423
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,005
"you take that money...

424
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,841
and you throw it in the river!"

425
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:35,096
- In the river!
- In the river!

426
00:33:57,244 --> 00:34:00,037
Now, you're John, and you're Pearl.

427
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,039
Pearl? Pearl?

428
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,710
You'll get awful mad, John.
I done a sin.

429
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:08,963
- Pearl!
- I didn't tell no one.

430
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:13,426
Pearl, oh, Pearl.

431
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,469
It's all here.

432
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,740
- John.
- Yes?

433
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,826
- What are you doing, boy?
- Gettin' Pearl to bed.

434
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,912
- What's taking you so long about it?
- Nothing.

435
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,920
What's that you're playin' with?

436
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:54,759
Uh, Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad
when she plays out here and don't put it away.

437
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,802
Come on, children.

438
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,308
Off to bed with the both of you.

439
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,025
Come here, John.

440
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,739
Your mother tells me you tattled on me.

441
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,283
She said you told her
I asked where that money was hid.

442
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,121
That wasn't very nice, boy.

443
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:25,873
Have a heart.

444
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,167
Yeah.

445
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:31,962
Well, it doesn't matter.
It's your word against mine.

446
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,256
It's me your mother believes.

447
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,515
Were you impudent again
to Mr. Powell, John?

448
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,600
Mom, I didn't mean it.

449
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,521
What were you impudent about?

450
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,940
He asked me about the money again, Mom.

451
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,360
John, you always make up that lie.

452
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,570
There is no money.

453
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,615
Why can't you get that through your head?

454
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,326
The boy's as stubborn
and as mulish as a sheep.

455
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,537
- It's a shame.
- Good night, Icey.

456
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,455
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Walt.

457
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,082
Good night, Willa.

458
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,670
Plan on a longer visit next time.

459
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,506
You hardly get settled
before you're frettin' to get home again.

460
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,175
I'm needed to keep peace
and harmony betwixt them.

461
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,095
It's my burden,
and I'm proud of it, Icey.

462
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:34,692
- Where's the money hid?
- I don't know.

463
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,570
She thinks that money's
at the bottom of the river.

464
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:40,030
But you and me, we know better,
don't we, little lad?

465
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,575
I don't know nothin'.

466
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,120
Well, never mind, boy.
The summer's young yet.

467
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,205
Pearl?

468
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,957
Come here.

469
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:56,046
John's a fella likes to keep secrets.
I'll tell you a secret.

470
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,798
Yes?

471
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,593
I knowed your daddy.

472
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:03,470
And you know what your daddy told me?

473
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,598
He said,
"You tell my little girl Pearl...

474
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,183
that there's to be no secrets
between her and you."

475
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:11,270
- Yes?
- All right. Now it's your turn.

476
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,148
What secret shall I tell?

477
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,692
Oh, uh, what's your name?

478
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,196
You're just fooling.
My name's Pearl.

479
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:24,825
Well, I reckon I'll have to try again.

480
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,827
Uh, where's the money hid?

481
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:33,751
Pearl, you swore you wouldn't tell!
You swore! You swore! You swore!

482
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,712
You hit Daddy with a hairbrush.

483
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,134
Now, you see?
We just can't have anything to do with John.

484
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,637
You and me are goin' down
to the parlor, Pearl.

485
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,532
John was just plumb bad
through and through.

486
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,702
- John's bad.
- Yes, John's bad.

487
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,289
Tell me another secret about my dad.

488
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:14,249
Oh, no. Your turn.

489
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,628
All right. What secret shall I tell?

490
00:38:18,712 --> 00:38:20,214
Where's the money hid?

491
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,258
- John's bad.
- Where's the money hid?

492
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:27,137
You tell me, you little wretch,
or I'll tear your arm off!

493
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:43,153
- Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
- How do you mean?

494
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,864
Well, I'm figurin' how to say it
so as you won't get mad.

495
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,866
Say what, Walt Spoon?

496
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,327
- There's something wrong about it, Mother.
- About what?

497
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,372
- About Mr. Powell, all of it.
- Walt!

498
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,499
Now, Mother, a body's
got a right to their feelings.

499
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,627
May the Lord have mercy on you,
Walt Spoon.

500
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,170
Now, Mother, I was just-

501
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,176
Amen.

502
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,888
Are you through praying?

503
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,974
I'm through, Harry.

504
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,685
You were listening outside the parlor window.

505
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,355
- It ain't in the river, is it, Harry?
- Answer me.

506
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,275
Ben never told you he throwed it
in the river, did he?

507
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,455
The children know where it's hid.

508
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,041
John knows. Is that it, Harry?

509
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,382
Then it's still here amongst us...

510
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,384
tainting us.

511
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,807
You must have known about it
all along, Harry.

512
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:57,603
But that ain't the reason
why you married me.

513
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,646
I know that much.

514
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,817
Because the Lord just wouldn't let it be.

515
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,072
He made you marry me...

516
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:11,158
so you could show me
the way and the life...

517
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,329
and the salvation of my soul.

518
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,624
Ain't that so, Harry?

519
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:23,420
So you might say that it was the money
that brung us together.

520
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:27,174
The rest of it don't matter.

521
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,316
Walt! Come quick!

522
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,111
- What's wrong, Mother?
- He's in there.

523
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,654
- Who?
- Mr. Powell.

524
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,824
Willa has run away.

525
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,576
I'll be switched. Just went?

526
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,162
She took out some time in the night
in that old Model "T."

527
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,706
- Oh, is he hit pretty bad?
- All to pieces.

528
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,916
- There's a little peach brandy in here.
- Walt!

529
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,836
- A man of the cloth?
- Well, just a sip.

530
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,998
Walt Spoon, that's for sickness in the house!

531
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:54,511
- Well, what can we do, Mother?
- I thought if you went and talked to him- you know, another man.

532
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,264
- Oh, no, now, Mother, please. No, I'm no good at-
- Get in there.

533
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,936
- Mr. Powell?
- A strange woman is a narrow pit.

534
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,188
Amen. Amen.

535
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:08,108
She lieth in wait as for prey
and increaseth the transgressors among men.

536
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,571
Oh, my dear, dear friends,
whatever would I do without you?

537
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,156
Mr. Powell!

538
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,200
Well, if there's anything-
anything we can-

539
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:19,578
No, it's my shame. It's my crown of thorns.
I must wear it bravely.

540
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,622
What could have possessed that girl?

541
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:22,907
Satan.

542
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,875
Didn't you have no inklin'?

543
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,337
Yes, I did from the very first night.

544
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,131
- First night?
- Our honeymoon.

545
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,383
How's that?

546
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,886
She turned me out of the bed.

547
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,472
No.

548
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,350
- Well, what do you figure to do?
- Do?

549
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,603
Why, just stay right here
and take care of them kids.

550
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,898
Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa
to taint their young lives.

551
00:42:49,782 --> 00:42:51,276
It's mighty brave of you, Preacher.

552
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:55,405
Oh, I reckon it was just ordained that way,
brother Spoon.

553
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,075
Didn't- Didn't she leave no word?

554
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,829
A scrawl on a notepaper on the bureau.

555
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,249
I burned it.

556
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,627
Tore it up and burned it.
It stank so strong of hellfire.

557
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,504
Amen.

558
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,757
The pitcher has went to the well
once too often, friends.

559
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,593
Oh, she'll come draggin' her tail back home.

560
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:20,597
She'll not be back.
I reckon I'm safe in promisin' you that.

561
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,766
- Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
- No, no.

562
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,061
- Well, there's no harm in hopin'.
- Ain't no sense in it neither.

563
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,482
I figured somethin' like that was brewin'
when she went to bed last night.

564
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,900
How?

565
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,946
Well, she tarried around in the kitchen
after I'd gone up...

566
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,282
and when I went downstairs
to see what was wrong-

567
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,617
What?

568
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:43,453
Well, she'd found this jar
of dandelion wine...

569
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:47,040
that the husband- this Harper-
had hid somewheres in the cellar.

570
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,153
She was drinkin'.

571
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,547
I tried to save her.

572
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,217
I know you did, Mr. Powell.
I know how hard you tried.

573
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,220
But the devil wins sometimes.

574
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,557
Can't nobody say
I didn't do my best to save her.

575
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:05,118
<i>Leaning</i>

576
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,746
<i>Leaning</i>

577
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:13,043
<i>Safe and secure from all alarms</i>

578
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:18,382
<i>Leaning</i>

579
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:23,804
<i>Leaning on the everlasting arms</i>

580
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,724
Children!

581
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,811
Children.

582
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,905
Children.

583
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:44,699
Pearl?

584
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,747
Careful. Here.

585
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:53,125
Why do we have to hide, John?

586
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,168
Children.

587
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,713
- Where's Mom?
- She's gone to Moundsville.

588
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:02,259
- To see Dad?
- Yes, I reckon that's it.

589
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,853
Now, listen to me, Pearl.
You and me is runnin' off tonight.

590
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,271
- Why?
- Children.

591
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,774
If we stay here,
something awful will happen to us.

592
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:21,111
- Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
- No.

593
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,789
That's just it. No.

594
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:34,207
- Where are we going, John?
- Somewheres. I don't know yet.

595
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,252
I'm hungry, John.

596
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,380
- We'll steal somethin' to eat.
- It'll spoil our suppers.

597
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:41,965
Pearl.

598
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,806
I can hear you whisperin', children,
so I know you're down there.

599
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,601
I can feel myself gettin' awful mad.

600
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,773
I'm out of patience, children.

601
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,650
I'm coming to find you now.

602
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,988
Mr. Powell.

603
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:11,495
Well, well, Mrs. Spoon.

604
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,330
Where are the children?

605
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,582
They're down there in that cellar
playin' games...

606
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,792
and they won't mind me
when I call them.

607
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,753
I'm at my wit's end, Mrs. Spoon.

608
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,423
John? Pearl?

609
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,135
John! Pearl!

610
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:32,265
Shake a leg.

611
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,857
Well, well, well. What's that?

612
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:44,236
Just a little hot supper
I fixed for you and the children.

613
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,947
It seemed the Ieast we could do.

614
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,076
I won't have you worrying
poor Mr. Powell another minute.

615
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,329
Just look at you-
dust and filth from top to toe.

616
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,040
Want me to take 'em up
and wash 'em good?

617
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,668
No. No, thank you, dear Icey.
Thank you.

618
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,711
I'll tend to them. Thank you.

619
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,713
Don't be too hard on 'em, Preacher.

620
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:06,049
Poor motherless children.

621
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:10,303
Remember now, Mr. Powell,
don't be afraid to call on us.

622
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,685
Good-bye.

623
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,813
Good-bye, Miz Spoon, and thanks again.

624
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:31,575
Now, weren't you afraid, little lambs,
down there in all that dark?

625
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,760
They'll think it was me.

626
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,805
They'll say it was poor old Uncle Birdie.

627
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:59,519
If you could've seen it, Bess.

628
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,981
Down there in the deep place...

629
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:07,736
with her hair wavin' soft and lazy, like...

630
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,238
meadow grass under floodwater.

631
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,783
And that slit in her throat...

632
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,161
like she had an extra mouth.

633
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:24,461
You're the only human mortal
I can go to, Bess.

634
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,298
If I go to the law...

635
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,342
they'll hang it on me.

636
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:39,601
Sweet heaven, save poor old Uncle Birdie.

637
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,109
- I'm hungry.
- Sure.

638
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:53,365
And there's fried chicken, sweet potatoes,
corn bread and apple cobbler.

639
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:57,410
- Can I have my supper, please?
- Naturally.

640
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,863
Can I have milk too?

641
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,375
But first, we'll have a little talk-
about our secrets.

642
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,877
- No.
- And why not, pray tell?

643
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,295
'Cause John said I mustn't.

644
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,256
Never mind what John said!

645
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,384
John's a meddler.

646
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,636
Now stop that sniveling.

647
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,180
Look a-here.
You know what that is?

648
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,891
Wanna see something cute?

649
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,035
Now looky.

650
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,271
How about that?

651
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,108
This is what I use on meddlers.

652
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,276
John might be a meddler.

653
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:31,736
No, no.

654
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,697
No, no, little lamb. Don't touch it.

655
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,907
Don't touch my knife.
That makes me mad.

656
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,752
Makes me very, very mad.

657
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,871
Now, just tell me.
Where's the money hid?

658
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,249
But I swore.
I promised John I wouldn't tell.

659
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,626
John doesn't matter!

660
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:52,674
Can't I get that through your head,
you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch?

661
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:00,432
There now. You made me lose my temper.

662
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:05,311
I'm sorry. I am real sorry.

663
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,731
Now just tell me.

664
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,983
- Where's it hid, honey?
- I'll tell.

665
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,901
I thought I told you
to keep your mouth shut.

666
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:14,612
It ain't fair to make Pearl tell
when she swore she wouldn't.

667
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,197
I'll tell.

668
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,116
Well, I declare.

669
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,161
Sometimes I think poor old John
might make it to heaven yet.

670
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:23,496
All right, boy, where's the money?

671
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:26,666
In the cellar,
buried under a stone in the floor.

672
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,836
It'll go hard if I find you're lyin', boy.

673
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,380
I'm not lying. Go look for yourself.

674
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,144
All right.

675
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,937
Come along.

676
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,355
What?

677
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,694
Go ahead of me, the both of you.

678
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,530
Down those stairs.

679
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:04,162
You don't reckon I'd leave you,
do you, boy?

680
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,789
Well, don't you believe me?

681
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,374
Why, sure, boy. Sure.

682
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:14,297
All right. Where now?
Mind, no tricks now.

683
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,674
I can't abide a liar.

684
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,259
Yonder.

685
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,181
Oh, no, you don't.

686
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:31,689
- Now, where, boy? Where?
- Under the stone in the floor.

687
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,160
This is concrete.

688
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:47,038
John made a sin.
John told a lie.

689
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,585
The Lord's a-talkin' to me now.

690
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,337
He's a-sayin'...

691
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:58,258
"A liar is an abomination
before mine eyes."

692
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,094
Speak, boy. Where's it hid?

693
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:03,347
Speak.

694
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,391
Speak, or I'll cut your throat
and leave you to drip...

695
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,852
like a hog hung up in butcherin' time.

696
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:12,397
Pearl, shut up. Pearl, you swore.

697
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,233
You could save him, little bird.

698
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,319
It's in my doll! It's in my doll!

699
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,650
The doll.

700
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:28,496
Why, sure.

701
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:30,915
Last place anybody'd think to look.

702
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,069
Uncle Birdie Steptoe.

703
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,530
Open that door!

704
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:05,450
You spawn of the devil's own strumpet!

705
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,355
Uncle Birdie! Uncle Birdie!

706
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:39,651
- Uncle Birdie.
- Don't.

707
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:42,528
Hide us, Uncle Birdie.
He's a-comin' with his knife.

708
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,993
It's me- John Harper and Pearl.
You told me to come.

709
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:51,496
- Johnny?
- Uncle Birdie. Oh, please.

710
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,498
Please! Wake up!

711
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:57,168
I swear on- on the Book.
I never done it. I-

712
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,462
I never-

713
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,310
There's still the river.

714
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:24,737
The skiff is under the willow.

715
00:55:43,556 --> 00:55:44,390
Children!

716
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:57,979
Children!

717
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:29,195
<i>Once upon a time</i>

718
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,698
<i>There was a pretty fly</i>

719
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,785
<i>He had a pretty wife</i>

720
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,870
<i>This pretty fly</i>

721
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:44,460
<i>But one day she flew away</i>

722
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:47,922
<i>Flew away</i>

723
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:54,470
<i>She had two pretty children</i>

724
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,514
<i>But one night</i>

725
00:57:56,598 --> 00:58:01,561
<i>These two pretty children</i>

726
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:08,151
<i>Flew away</i>

727
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,988
<i>Into the sky</i>

728
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:18,244
<i>Into the moon</i>

729
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,844
"Dear Walt and Icey...

730
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,598
"I bet you been worried
and gave us up for lost.

731
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:43,269
"Took the kids down here with me
for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm.

732
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:47,356
"Thought a little change of scenery
would do us all a world of good...

733
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,410
"after so much trouble and heartache.

734
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:53,196
"At least the kids will get a-plenty
of good home cookin'.

735
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,616
Your devoted Harry Powell."

736
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,784
Now, ain't you relieved, Walt?

737
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,287
Sure. But you was worried too, Mother.

738
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,915
Takin' off with never a word of good-bye.

739
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:07,543
You know, I got to figurin' maybe them Gypsies
busted in and done off with all three of 'em.

740
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:10,171
You and your Gypsies.
They've been gone a week.

741
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:14,300
Sure. But not before one of 'em
knifed a farmer and stole his horse.

742
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,802
Never caught the Gypsy nor the horse.

743
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:36,489
Such times when young 'uns run the roads.

744
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,324
Go away, children.

745
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:47,208
Hungry, I suppose.

746
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,169
- Well, I can't spare you more than one potato apiece.
- Come on.

747
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:53,839
- Where're your folks?
- Ain't got none.

748
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,592
Oh, go away. Go away.

749
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:08,688
An ungrateful child
is an abomination before the eyes of God.

750
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:13,192
The world is fast goin' to damnation because of
impudent young 'uns a-flyin' in the face of age.

751
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,959
They make soup out of them...

752
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,712
but I wouldn't know
how to go about gettin' 'em open.

753
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,271
We're gonna spend the night on land.

754
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:03,594
<i>Hush, little one</i>

755
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:07,556
<i>Hush</i>

756
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:12,019
<i>Hush, my little one</i>

757
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:16,023
<i>Hush</i>

758
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:18,692
<i>Morning soon</i>

759
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:23,697
<i>Shall light your pillow</i>

760
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,617
<i>Birds will sing</i>

761
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:31,622
<i>In yonder willow</i>

762
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:35,543
<i>Hush, my little one</i>

763
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:39,505
<i>Hush</i>

764
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,258
- Are we going home now, John?
- <i>Hush, little one</i>

765
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,096
<i>Hush</i>

766
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,480
<i>Rest, dearest one</i>

767
01:02:56,565 --> 01:03:00,943
<i>Rest</i>

768
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:08,659
<i>Rest here on my breast</i>

769
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,954
<i>Little child</i>

770
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:16,167
<i>With heart so brave</i>

771
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:19,462
<i>Angel hosts</i>

772
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:24,550
<i>Will keep you safe</i>

773
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:29,221
<i>Rest, my little one</i>

774
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:32,808
<i>Rest</i>

775
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:37,313
<i>Rest, little one</i>

776
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:41,150
<i>Rest</i>

777
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,899
<i>Leaning</i>

778
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:25,110
<i>Leaning</i>

779
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,321
<i>Safe and secure</i>

780
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:30,950
<i>From all alarms</i>

781
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:37,915
<i>Leaning</i>

782
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:45,381
<i>Leaning on the everlasting arms</i>

783
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,092
<i>What a fellowship</i>

784
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,803
<i>What a peace is mine</i>

785
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,138
<i>Leaning on the everlasting arms</i>

786
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:56,225
Don't he never sleep?

787
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,894
<i>What a blessedness</i>

788
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:00,980
<i>What a joy divine</i>

789
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,731
Pearl! Wake up!

790
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,066
Come on! Pearl!

791
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,111
<i>...on the everlasting arms</i>

792
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:12,908
<i>Leaning</i>

793
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:14,910
<i>Safe and secure</i>

794
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:18,163
<i>From all alarms</i>

795
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,481
You two youngsters
get up here to me this instant.

796
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:52,401
Get on up to my house.

797
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,446
Mind me now.
I'll get me a switch.

798
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,421
- Don't you hurt her!
- Hurt her, nothing.

799
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:14,006
Wash her is more like it.

800
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,801
Ruby! Clary! Mary!

801
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:19,303
Yes, Miz Cooper!

802
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:21,805
Bring your baskets.

803
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,103
Nicely picked, Clary.

804
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:30,439
Mary, put the big ones on top.

805
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,400
Oh, Ruby. Most of them
ain't fit to go to market.

806
01:08:33,485 --> 01:08:35,110
Well, put your baskets down.

807
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:39,198
Ruby, run to the house and fetch the tub
and put it by the pump.

808
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:42,284
Clary, uh, Mary, run up
and fetch a bar of laundry soap.

809
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,120
- Yes, Miz Cooper.
- And a scrub brush.

810
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:46,955
Come on up to the house, children.

811
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:52,419
Gracious! If you ain't a sight to beat all.

812
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:54,087
Where you from?

813
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:59,134
Where're your folks?
Come on, speak up now.

814
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:04,389
Gracious. So I've got
two more mouths to feed.

815
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,127
Howdy, Miz Cooper.
What happened to my milk supply?

816
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,129
Price of milk what it is,
not on your life.

817
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,841
Do better making butter with the cream,
sell it retail.

818
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:41,218
Make smearcase for the children,
feed what's left to my hogs.

819
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:44,972
- She talks to herself.
- All the time.

820
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:47,224
- Your ma's funny.
- She ain't our ma.

821
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,017
We just live at her house.

822
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,186
- Where are your folks?
- Someplace.

823
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:53,230
My daddy's in Detroit.

824
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:56,358
Mary!

825
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,320
Honey. Good morning, Miz Cooper.

826
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,406
Guess what.
I'm saving up to buy you a charm bracelet.

827
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,199
Never mind the gewgaws.

828
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:06,827
Don't forget your visit this Sunday,
and come to church with us.

829
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,706
See ya Sunday, love.

830
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,126
Take your baskets in, children.

831
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,545
Women is fools.

832
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,130
All of 'em.

833
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,009
Look a-there.

834
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,845
She'll be losing her mind
to a tricky mouth and a fool moon.

835
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,556
And like as not,
I'll be settled with the consequences.

836
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:31,143
Here's what you owe me.

837
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:36,565
One, two, three, four, five-
Where's the other basket?

838
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,692
- Where's Ruby?
- She went.

839
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,111
John, you go find Ruby.

840
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:44,740
Big Ruby's my bothersome girl.
She can't get eggs without bustin' them.

841
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,826
But she's got mother hands with the young 'uns,
so what are you to say?

842
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:51,788
How about tonight, Ruby?

843
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:55,334
- What gives?
- The old lady's around.

844
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:58,337
How about Thursday?

845
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,965
The old gal thinks she comes in
for sewing lessons on Thursday.

846
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:04,343
Miz Cooper wants you.

847
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:11,099
And will you show me
your dolly, little lady?

848
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:13,810
I see you got two more peeps in your brood.

849
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,979
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.

850
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:17,773
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?

851
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:19,775
Haven't heard from Ralph
since last Christmas.

852
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:21,860
Don't matter though.
I've got a new crop.

853
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:27,032
I'm a strong tree
with branches for many birds.

854
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,243
I'm good for somethin' in this old world,
and I know it too.

855
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:58,313
Now, old pharaoh,
he was king of Egypt land...

856
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:00,107
and he had a daughter.

857
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,235
And once upon a time...

858
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:06,822
she was walkin' along by the riverbank...

859
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:12,369
and she seen somethin' bumpin' and scrapin'
along on a sandbar down under the willows.

860
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:15,622
- And you know what it was, children?
- No.

861
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:18,542
Now, it was a skiff,
washed up on the bar.

862
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,503
And who do you reckon was in it?

863
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,255
Pearl and John.

864
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,298
Not this time.

865
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:29,511
There was only one young 'un-
a little boy babe.

866
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:32,597
- And you know who he was, children?
- No.

867
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,436
It was Moses- a king of men.

868
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,438
Moses, children.

869
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,274
Now off to bed with you.

870
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,901
John, get me an apple.

871
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:04,171
And get one for yourself too.

872
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:19,895
John, where are your folks?

873
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,064
- Dead.
- Dead?

874
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,859
Where are you from?

875
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,153
Upriver.

876
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:33,617
Well, I didn't figure you'd rowed that skiff
all the way up from Parkersburg.

877
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:50,008
Tell me that story again.

878
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,636
Story? What story, honey?

879
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,971
About them kings...

880
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:59,059
and the queen found down on the sandbar
that time on the skiff.

881
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:02,229
Kings? Why, there was only one king, honey.

882
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:05,482
I mind you said there was two.

883
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,736
Well, shoot now.
Maybe there was.

884
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,406
Yes, come to think of it,
there was two.

885
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:42,727
Must be Thursday.
Here comes Ruby.

886
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,736
Here I go.

887
01:14:58,286 --> 01:15:00,662
Why, you're Ruby.
Ain't you, my child?

888
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,873
- Can I have this?
- Surely.

889
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:04,666
I'd like to talk to you, my dear.

890
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,668
- Will you buy me an ice cream?
- Of course.

891
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,004
- Watch out, Preacher.
- Why, Preacher.

892
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:11,047
Shut your dirty mouths.

893
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,894
Ain't I pretty?

894
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,646
Why, you're the prettiest thing
I ever seen in all my wanderin'.

895
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,859
Ain't nobody never toId you that, Ruby?

896
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,569
No. No one never did.

897
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,198
There's, uh, two new ones
out your place, ain't there?

898
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,994
- What's their names?
- Pearl and John.

899
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:44,372
Ah, yeah. Is there a doll?

900
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:46,583
Only they don't never
let me play with it.

901
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:57,260
Did you ever see such pretty eyes
in all your born days?

902
01:15:58,045 --> 01:15:59,721
Don't let him get away, sugar.

903
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:03,975
He ain't like you all. Next time,
I won't even ask him to buy me an ice cream.

904
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:14,861
I've been bad.

905
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,909
Ruby, you didn't have money
to buy this.

906
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,828
- You'll whip me.
- When did I ever?

907
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,706
- This man at the drugstore, he gave me-
- The drugstore?

908
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:32,128
Miz Cooper, I never been to sewin' lessons
all them times.

909
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:34,047
What you been up to, Ruby?

910
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:36,466
I been out with men.

911
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,095
Child.

912
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:42,222
Oh, my God.

913
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,603
You were lookin' for love, Ruby,
in the only foolish way you knew how.

914
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,777
We all need love, Ruby.

915
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,154
I lost the love of my son.

916
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,407
I found it with you all.

917
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:05,620
You're gonna grow up
to be a strong, fine woman...

918
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:07,747
and I'm gonna see to it that you do.

919
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:09,624
This gentleman weren't like them.

920
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:12,460
He just give me a book
and buy me an ice cream.

921
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:15,797
- Now, who was this?
- He didn't ask me for nothin'.

922
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,549
What'd you talk about?

923
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,676
Pearl and John.

924
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,720
John and Pearl?

925
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,972
- Is he their pap?
- I don't know.

926
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,892
Wonder why he hasn't been to the house.

927
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:48,955
Oh, Miz Cooper! Miz Cooper!

928
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,499
- What?
- The man! The man!

929
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:57,922
Good mornin', ladies.

930
01:17:58,007 --> 01:17:59,341
How do?

931
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:02,052
Why, you're Miz Cooper, I take it.

932
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,346
It's about that John and that Pearl?

933
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,514
Oh, them poor little lambs.

934
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:09,017
To think I never hoped
to see them again in this world.

935
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:13,521
Oh, dear madam, if you was to know
what a crown of thorns I've borne...

936
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,816
in my search for them stray chicks.

937
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:19,194
Ruby, go fetch them kids.

938
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:25,408
Oh, madam, I see you're lookin' at my hands.

939
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:28,495
Would you like me to tell you
the little story of left hand and right hand-

940
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,038
the tale of good and evil?

941
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:34,000
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain
struck the blow that laid his brother low-

942
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:35,710
Them kids is yours?

943
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:38,088
My own flesh and blood.

944
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:39,589
Where's your missus?

945
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:44,302
Uh, she run off with a drummer-
during prayer meetin'.

946
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:46,596
- Where's she at?
- Down the river somewheres.

947
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:50,225
Parkersburg maybe or Cincinnati-
one of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.

948
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,060
She took them kids with her?

949
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:55,063
Oh, heaven only knows
what unholy sights and sounds...

950
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:59,651
them innocent little babes has heard
in the dens of perdition where she dragged 'em.

951
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:03,571
Right funny, ain't it, how they rowed
all the way upriver in a 10-foot johnboat.

952
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,283
Are they well, Miz Cooper?

953
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:09,661
A sight better than they was.

954
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:15,041
Gracious, gracious.
You are a good woman, Miz Cooper.

955
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:17,710
How you figurin' to raise them two
without a woman?

956
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:19,921
The Lord will provide.

957
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,798
The Lord is merciful.

958
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:24,300
Oh, what a day this is.

959
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:26,594
And there's little John.

960
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:29,389
- What's wrong, John?
- Come to me, boy.

961
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:32,267
- What's wrong, John?
- Didn't you hear me, boy?

962
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,602
John, when your dad says come,
you should mind him.

963
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,688
He ain't my dad.

964
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,402
No. And he ain't no preacher neither.

965
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:53,621
Just march yourself yonder
to your horse, mister.

966
01:19:56,967 --> 01:19:58,668
March, mister! I'm not foolin'!

967
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:06,050
All right, but you haven't heard
the last of Harry Powell yet.

968
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,555
The Lord God Jehovah
will guide my hand in vengeance.

969
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:14,058
You devils!

970
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,729
You Whores of Babylon!

971
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:26,237
I'll be back when it's dark!

972
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:42,253
<i>Leaning</i>

973
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,589
<i>Safe and secure</i>

974
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:48,718
<i>From all alarms</i>

975
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:56,392
<i>Leaning</i>

976
01:20:56,477 --> 01:21:04,317
<i>Leaning on the everlasting arms</i>

977
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:07,946
<i>What a fellowship</i>

978
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:11,115
<i>What a joy divine</i>

979
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:16,162
<i>Leaning on the everlasting arms</i>

980
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:19,374
<i>What a blessedness</i>

981
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:23,878
<i>What a peace is mine</i>

982
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:29,676
<i>Leaning on the everlasting arms</i>

983
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:36,391
- <i>Leaning on Jesus</i>
- <i>Leaning</i>

984
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:38,893
<i>Safe and secure</i>

985
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:43,398
<i>From all alarms</i>

986
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:50,697
- <i>Leaning on Jesus</i>
- <i>Leaning</i>

987
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:53,366
<i>Leaning on</i>

988
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:59,330
<i>The everlasting arms</i>

989
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,458
Shame on you, Ruby...

990
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:05,378
mooning around the house
after that mad dog of a man.

991
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:09,048
Merciful heavens!

992
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:13,177
Ruby, go get the children out of bed
and bring them down here.

993
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:18,392
Women are such durn fools.

994
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:39,954
It's a hard world for little things.

995
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:05,229
Now, there was this sneakin',
no-account, ornery King Herod.

996
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:07,565
And when he heard tell
of little Jesus growin' up...

997
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:11,319
he figured, "Well, shoot,
there won't be no room for the both of us.

998
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,321
I'll just nip this in the bud."

999
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:16,866
But he wasn't sure which of all them
babies in the land was King Jesus.

1000
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:21,454
So that cruel old King Herod figured
if he was to kill all the babies in the land...

1001
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,206
he'd be sure and get little Jesus.

1002
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:26,376
And when little King Jesus' ma and pa
heard about this plan...

1003
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,002
what do you reckon they went and done?

1004
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:30,380
- They hid in a broom closet.
- They hid under the porch.

1005
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:33,383
No. They went a-runnin'.

1006
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:37,178
Well, now, John, you're right.
That's just what they done.

1007
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,847
And little King Jesus' ma and pa
saddled a mule...

1008
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,475
and they rode all the way down
into Egypt land.

1009
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:45,895
Yeah. And that's where the queen
found 'im in the "billy rushes."

1010
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:49,023
Oh, no. That wasn't the same story at all.
That was little King Moses.

1011
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:53,027
But just the same, it did seem
like it was a plague time for little ones...

1012
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:55,947
them olden days, them hard, hard times.

1013
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,997
Figured I was gone, huh?

1014
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:08,126
Run! Hide in the staircase!
Run quick!

1015
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,711
Ruby! Git!

1016
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:13,506
- What do you want?
- I want them kids.

1017
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:16,884
- What do you want them for?
- That's none of your business, madam.

1018
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:18,678
I'm giving you to the count of three
to get out of here.

1019
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:20,014
Then I'm comin' across the kitchen shooting.

1020
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:38,072
Miz Booher? Rachel Cooper.

1021
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:40,283
Get your state troopers out to my place.

1022
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:42,493
I got somethin' trapped in my barn.

1023
01:24:53,271 --> 01:24:55,089
I'll go see to Pearl.

1024
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:56,924
I'll make coffee.

1025
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:08,019
She's all right.

1026
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:11,939
John, you know, when you're little...

1027
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:15,359
you have more endurance
than God is ever to grant you again?

1028
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:18,738
Children are man at his strongest.
They abide.

1029
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:34,462
Why didn't you call us before now?

1030
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:37,089
Didn't want your dirty shoes
trackin' up my clean floors.

1031
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:39,008
- Is that him, ma'am?
- Yes.

1032
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:41,135
Mind where you shoot, boys.
There are children here.

1033
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:44,889
Harry Powell, you're under arrest
for the murder of Willa Harper.

1034
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:48,392
Drop that knife, Powell.

1035
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:51,771
Don't.

1036
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:56,108
Don't!

1037
01:25:57,402 --> 01:26:00,488
- Here! Here!
- John! John!

1038
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:03,449
Take it back, Dad! Take it back!
I don't want it, Dad!

1039
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:05,743
It's too much! Here!

1040
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:06,953
Here!

1041
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:19,257
Lynch him! Lynch him!

1042
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:21,133
Bluebeard!

1043
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:24,136
- Twenty-five wives!
- And he killed every last one of 'em!

1044
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:27,265
- The people of Marshall County-
- Bluebeard!

1045
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:31,394
Lynch him! Lynch him!

1046
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:36,566
Will you identify the prisoner?

1047
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,150
Please, little lad.

1048
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,444
Won't you look yonder
and tell the court...

1049
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:43,030
if that is the man
that killed your mother?

1050
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:53,291
It's all right, Mrs. Cooper.
You can take the little fellow away.

1051
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:56,627
Merry Christmas to you and yours, Mrs. Cooper.

1052
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:59,964
And what's Santa Claus going
to bring you for Christmas, little man?

1053
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,634
Bluebeard! Bluebeard! Bluebeard!

1054
01:27:08,847 --> 01:27:10,608
Bring out that bluebeard!

1055
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,768
There's Pearl!

1056
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:14,562
Get your coats.

1057
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:16,230
Them's her orphans!

1058
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:18,441
- Where's Ruby?
- She went.

1059
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:21,402
Them poor little lambs!

1060
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:25,656
Them is the ones he sinned against,
my friends!

1061
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:26,782
Go out the back door.

1062
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:29,702
Don't just stand around. Come on.
They're bringing him out.

1063
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,915
Ain't we goin' to the bus depot?

1064
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:39,086
Draggin' the name of the Lord
through the evil mud of his soul!

1065
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:40,838
String that bluebeard up to a pole!

1066
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:43,424
He's Satan hidin' behind the cross!

1067
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:44,710
Come on!

1068
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:31,889
I love him.

1069
01:28:31,974 --> 01:28:34,016
You think he's like them others.

1070
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:41,732
You were so mad, you shot him.

1071
01:28:58,166 --> 01:28:59,667
- Hey, Bart.
- Yeah?

1072
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,585
We're savin' this bird up for you.

1073
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,587
This time, it'll be a privilege.

1074
01:29:28,655 --> 01:29:30,698
I'm glad they didn't send me nothin'.

1075
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:32,408
Whenever they do, it's nothin' I want...

1076
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:35,995
but just something to show me
how fancy and smart they come up in the world.

1077
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,795
Can we give you your Christmas presents now?

1078
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,631
Shoot. You don't mean to say
you got me a present?

1079
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:49,759
Shoot now.

1080
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:57,516
Ruby.

1081
01:29:57,601 --> 01:30:00,227
A potholder.

1082
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:03,898
And it's much neater
than last year, Ruby.

1083
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,483
Clary.

1084
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:10,404
Another potholder.
Now, ain't that thoughtful?

1085
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:12,615
I'm always burnin' my hands.

1086
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,327
Oh, this doesn't look basted.

1087
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:17,512
This looks made.

1088
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:21,165
Oh, and you finished the edge
with a chain stitch.

1089
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,336
Oh, that's just dandy, Clary.

1090
01:30:26,213 --> 01:30:28,007
Another potholder?

1091
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:36,388
Oh, now, did you two make this together?

1092
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:37,973
You helped us some.

1093
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:51,237
That's the richest gift
a body could have.

1094
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:54,949
And your presents are in the cupboard
under the china closet.

1095
01:30:56,533 --> 01:30:57,660
Ruby.

1096
01:31:00,247 --> 01:31:02,206
This is yours.

1097
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:18,013
Oh, look what you've got!

1098
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:20,850
Lord save little children.

1099
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:24,645
You'd think the world would be ashamed
to name such a day as Christmas for one of them...

1100
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:27,106
and then go on in the same old way.

1101
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:32,903
My soul is humble when I see the way
little ones accept their lot.

1102
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,490
Lord save little children.

1103
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:38,993
The wind blows, and the rains are cold.

1104
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:41,746
Yet they abide.

1105
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,860
That watch sure is a fine loud ticker.

1106
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:18,115
Be nice to have someone around the house
who can give me the right time of day.

1107
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:22,661
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.

1108
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:26,415
Well, a fella just can't go round
with rundown, busted watches.

1109
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:35,925
They abide, and they endure.
