1
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,339
Right, let's sort the buyers
from the spyers,

2
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:49,882
the needy from the greedy,

3
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,552
and those who trust me
from the ones who don't.

4
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,846
Because if you can't see 
value here today,

5
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,640
you're not up here shopping,
you're up here shoplifting.

6
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:58,850
You see these goods?

7
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,477
Never seen daylight,
moonlight, Israelite

8
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,895
or Fanny by the gaslight.

9
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,856
Take a bag.
Come on, take a bag.

10
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,190
I took a bag home last night,

11
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,401
and it cost me a lot more than £10,
I can tell you.

12
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,736
Anyone like jewelry?

13
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,073
Look at that one there.
Handmade in Italy, hand stolen in Stepney.

14
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,576
It's as long as my arm.
I wish it was as long as something else.

15
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,328
Don't think 'cause these boxes
are sealed up they're empty.

16
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,039
The only man who sells empty boxes
is the undertaker.

17
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,916
And by the look of some 
of you lot here today,

18
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,003
I'd make more money with me measuring tape.
Here, one price.

19
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,713
- £10.
- Did you say £10?

20
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,839
Are you deaf?

21
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,299
That's a bargain.
I'll take one.

22
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,260
Squeeze in if you can.
Left leg, right leg, your body will follow.

23
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,763
They call it walking.
You want one as well, darling?

24
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,765
You do. That's it, they're waking up.

25
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,225
Treat the wife, 
treat somebody else's wife.

26
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,519
It's a lot more fun
if you don't get caught.

27
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:44,812
Hold on, you want one as well?

28
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,564
Okay, darling, show me a bit of life then.

29
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,941
It's no good standing out there
like 1:00 half struck.

30
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,777
Buy them, you better buy them!

31
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,321
These are not stolen,
they just haven't been paid for.

32
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,448
And we can't get them again, 
they've changed the bloody locks.

33
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,408
Here, one for you.
It's no good coming back later

34
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,826
when I've sold out.

35
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,745
"Too late, too late!"
will be the cry

36
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,830
when the man with the bargains 
has passed you by.

37
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,582
And if you've got no money 
on you now,

38
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,043
you'll be crying tears 
as big as October cabbages.

39
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,711
Bacon, cozzers.

40
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,048
Shit.

41
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,021
<i>Ed can hustle a few quid here and there,</i>

42
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,691
<i>but his real talent lies in cards 
and gambling with cards.</i>

43
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,823
<i>Bacon could see that his days of selling</i>

44
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,867
<i>moody goods on street corners 
are numbered.</i>

45
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,411
<i>It's time to move on
and he knows it.</i>

46
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,389
And I'm 6'1", that's perfect 
for my height, all right?

47
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,766
All right, you take a photo. 
You're catching up with me, you are.

48
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,435
Look, what are you talking about? 
I'm bloody skinny, pal.

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,646
Yeah, yeah, of course you are.
All right?

50
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,189
Nick the Greek, always a pleasure.

51
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,440
Tom, what have you been eating?

52
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,860
- I've been telling him this...
- Enough already.

53
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,237
You two, join me in my office.

54
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,868
So, how much is it then, Tom?

55
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,494
You know how much it is, Nick.

56
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,288
And that includes the amp, yeah?

57
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,790
No, that does not include the amp.

58
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,711
Shit, Tom, 
I thought it included the amp.

59
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,170
Well, it doesn't.

60
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,131
I'll throw in one of these telephones
if you like,

61
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,550
but it does not include the amp.

62
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,468
Very nice.

63
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,388
I hope it includes the speakers.

64
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,681
It doesn't include the speakers,

65
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,182
it doesn't include the amp,

66
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,559
and it's not supposed 
to include me

67
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,019
getting the hump
with your stupid questions.

68
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,479
Now you want it, Nick, you buy it.

69
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,564
What else do I get with it?

70
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,190
You get a gold-plated Rolls-Royce,

71
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,984
as long as you pay for it.

72
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,486
Don't know, Tom.
Seems expensive.

73
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,073
Seems? Well, this seems to be 
a waste of my time.

74
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,535
That is 900 nicker in any shop 
you're lucky enough to find one in,

75
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,537
and you're complaining about 200?

76
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,372
What school of finance did you study?

77
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:12,251
It's a deal, it's a steal.
It's the sale of the fucking century.

78
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,504
In fact, fuck it, Nick, 
I think I'll keep it.

79
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,424
All right, all right,
keep your Alans on.

80
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:23,846
Here's a ton.

81
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,183
Jesus Christ.
You could choke a dozen donkeys on that.

82
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,769
And you're haggling over £100?

83
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,812
What do you do when you're not 
buying stereos, Nick?

84
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,356
Finance revolutions?

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,566
£100 is still £100.

86
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,110
Not when the price is £200, 
it's not. 

87
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,614
And certainly not when you got 
Liberia's deficit in your sky rocket.

88
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,533
Tighter than a duck's butt you are.
Now come on,

89
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,203
let me feel the fiber of your fabric.

90
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,915
<i>The skinny one is Tom,</i>

91
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,334
<i>and he's the entrepreneur of the bunch.</i>

92
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,380
<i>He's got a couple of dirty little fingers 
in a couple of dirty little pies.</i>

93
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,799
<i>Nick, here, however,
has made it his business</i>

94
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,593
<i>to have all 20 fat 
little fingers and toes</i>

95
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,388
<i>in every dirty bent
and stolen pie in London.</i>

96
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,433
<i>Between the two of them, there ain't much 
you can't get ahold of.</i>

97
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,815
That's my 25 grand, it's all there.

98
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,235
It took me a long time to earn that, 
so you treat it with respect.

99
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,195
What about the chef?

100
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,462
What have you come as?

101
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,965
Cupid, stupid.

102
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,427
That's the last time I'm getting 
any more fruit off of you, Tom.

103
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,761
Do you call that fresh?

104
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,346
There was more small, 
hairy armored things

105
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,390
in your fruit than there was fruit.

106
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,183
You should open a butcher's,
not a grocer's.

107
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,436
Well, if you will order stuff
from Katmandu,

108
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,355
don't be surprised if it picks up 
a few tourists en route.

109
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,565
Anyway, enough about that.

110
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,816
Where's the money?

111
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,900
Oi!

112
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,486
Keep your fingers out of my soup.

113
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,781
<i>Soap is called Soap because 
he likes to keep his hands clean</i>

114
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,450
<i>of any unlawful behavior.</i>

115
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,745
<i>He's proud of his job
and even more proud that it's legal.</i>

116
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,998
<i>He represents the more sensible side 
of the four.</i>

117
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,962
You sure you can afford 25?

118
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,048
That depends on how you look at it.

119
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,676
I can afford it as long as I see it again, 
if that's what you mean.

120
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,720
Got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?

121
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,847
Fat man, Bacon and myself.

122
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,100
Looks like it's time to make
that call to Harry.

123
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,311
Who's this fat man then, eh?

124
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,562
Eh?

125
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,356
Do you want a sandwich, Bacon?

126
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,571
<i>It's not easy to take a seat 
at this card table.</i>

127
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,741
<i>The amount of money involved
has to be 100 grand upwards,</i>

128
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,285
<i>and there's no shortage of punters.</i>

129
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,498
<i>The man who decides whether you can play 
or not is this man, Harry.</i>

130
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:59,502
<i>Or as some, including himself,
like to call him, Hatchet Harry.</i>

131
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,088
You got it all?

132
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,341
100 grand.

133
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,802
Well, if you got it,
you got it.

134
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,887
Now, if you don't mind...

135
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,934
What's this Eddie like, then?

136
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,645
He's a fucking thief.

137
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,607
<i>Harry has a colleague, 
a monster of a man, Barry the Baptist.</i>

138
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,527
<i>The Baptist got his name 
by drowning people for Hatchet.</i>

139
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,695
- Are you gonna fucking pay?
- Yeah, I'll pay!

140
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,031
- How are you gonna fucking pay?
- I'm gonna pay it!

141
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:33,619
<i>Barry makes sure the administrative side 
of the business runs harmoniously.</i>

142
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,704
The boy's got a rare ability.

143
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,666
He seems to make cards transparent.

144
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,792
He's got...

145
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,335
All right, all right,
so we can say he's good.

146
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,462
Oh, no, he's better than good.

147
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,631
He's a fucking liability.

148
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,592
Here, hold on.
What do you think of these?

149
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,511
We're selling hundreds.

150
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,263
Very nice, Harry.

151
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,348
What's it for?

152
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,601
Oh, don't play innocent with me, Bazza. 
Spanking.

153
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,394
There's 25 from me, Tom, 
Soap and yourself.

154
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,354
That's 100 grand to the pound.

155
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,940
So why the fuck are you counting it?

156
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,192
Because I like to.

157
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,528
So, a reasonable return should be 
in the region of 120 grand.

158
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,282
That's for 25 grand invested, 
going on previous experience.

159
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,617
Going on optimism.

160
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,370
Whatever it's going on, it should be enough 
to send you on a cooking course.

161
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,956
You're not funny, Tom.
You're fat.

162
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,250
And look as though you should be,
but you're not.

163
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,794
Fat? Who are you calling... Jesus!

164
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,713
It's good in here, isn't it?

165
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,340
Handy for the tube, great electrics.

166
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,633
I can see why you moved in.

167
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,594
Don't knock it,
it's cheap like the budgie.

168
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,389
And nobody wants to live next 
to the people we live next to.

169
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,600
A bit anti-social to say the least.

170
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,726
What do you mean?

171
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,853
He means they're thieving bastards.

172
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:26,065
I mean, when they're not picking peanuts
out of poop,

173
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,818
they rip off unfortunate souls 
of their hard-earned drugs.

174
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,531
Not exactly thick, these walls.

175
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,786
Nice work, John.
Get yourself a drink.

176
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,834
Is that it?

177
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,295
How many times do I have 
to tell you, Plank?

178
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,091
You find us a job worth doing, 
you'll find your share improving.

179
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,802
Now, have you got a problem with that?

180
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,861
You know, Charles,
this gear is getting heavier.

181
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,993
I have a strong suspicion
we should've been rocket scientists

182
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,745
or Nobel Peace Prize winners

183
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,914
or something.

184
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,416
Peace Prize?

185
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,129
Be lucky to find your penis for a piss 
the amount you keep smoking.

186
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,219
Who the hell's that?

187
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,479
All right, Willie?

188
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,940
Does it look like I'm all right?

189
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,400
Take this.

190
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,738
I'm in danger of breaking sweat
at any second.

191
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,782
Charles, why have we got that cage?

192
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,826
Security?

193
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,662
That's right.

194
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,664
That's right, security.

195
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,044
So what's the point in having it 
if we're not gonna fucking use it?

196
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,130
Well, I would have used it, Winston,
but this is Willie.

197
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,715
And Willie lives here.

198
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,842
Yes, Charles, 
but you didn't know it was Willie

199
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,553
until you opened the door, did you?

200
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,180
Chill, Winston.

201
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,475
It's me.
Charlie knows it's me.

202
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,935
What's the problem?

203
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,021
The problem is, Willie,

204
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,482
that Charles and yourself 
are not the quickest of cats

205
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,609
at the best of times.
So just do as I say

206
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,195
and keep the fucking cage locked!

207
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,449
What is that?

208
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,910
- That's Gloria.
- Yes, I know that's Gloria. 

209
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,453
What's that?

210
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,831
Fertilizer.

211
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,876
You went out six hours ago to buy
a money counter,

212
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,297
and you come back with a semi-conscious 
Gloria and a bag of fertilizer?

213
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,050
Alarm bells are ringing, Willie.

214
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,927
We need fertilizer, Winston.

215
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,262
We also need a money counter.

216
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,348
This money's gotta be out by Thursday.

217
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,059
I'm buggered if I'm gonna count it.

218
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,729
And if you do have to buy
sodding fertilizer,

219
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,482
could you just be a little more subtle?

220
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,776
What do you mean?

221
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,738
We grow copious amounts of ganja, yeah?

222
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,157
Yeah.

223
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:26,036
And you're carrying a wasted girl 
and a bag of fertilizer.

224
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,624
You don't look like your average
horti-fucking-culturalist.

225
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,835
That's what I mean, Willie.

226
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,360
How long's he been in there, Son?

227
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,571
About 20 minutes.

228
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,324
He's on his own?

229
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,452
Yeah, just carrying a bag.

230
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,207
All right, let's pay him 
a little visit then, shall we?

231
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,172
<i>Big Chris settles debts for Harry.</i>

232
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,258
<i>The only thing he cares more about 
than an unsettled debt,</i>

233
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,969
<i>is his son and heir, Little Chris.</i>

234
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,025
Shh!

235
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,614
This is one of them high-powered jobs, 
isn't it?

236
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,869
Got some bad news for you, John.

237
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,913
What the fuck...

238
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,665
You mind your language
in front of the boy.

239
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,250
Jesus Christ.

240
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,879
That includes blasphemy as well.

241
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,882
Now tell me, John,
how can you be concentrating

242
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,759
on improving this lovely tan,

243
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,802
and it is a lovely tan by the way,

244
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,722
when you've got more 
pressing priorities at hand?

245
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,057
Tell Harry...

246
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,434
I mean Mr. Harry,

247
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,187
I've been busy.
I'm nearly there.

248
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,356
Check his locker, Son.

249
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,857
I don't suppose there's any chance

250
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,110
of you lifting this sun bed up, Chris, 
is there?

251
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,865
He's not poor.

252
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,367
He's got over a monkey here,

253
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,118
and that's just in his wallet.

254
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,329
Fucking hell, John,

255
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,914
you always walk around
with that in your pocket?

256
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,082
Oi!

257
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,793
You use language like that again, Son, 
you'll wish you hadn't.

258
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,044
Sorry, Dad.

259
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,214
Right, well, put the rest 
of the stuff in that.

260
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,384
You can go home in a plastic bag
tonight, John.

261
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,927
You owe what you owe,

262
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,429
and by the time this tan's faded,

263
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,265
you wanna have paid.

264
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,522
You never would have paid.

265
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,773
Who would pay for shit?

266
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,859
Yeah, exactly.
I mean we ain't too certain...

267
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,572
Well, what the hell 
are you doing here?

268
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,906
Why, what's up?

269
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,993
Let me guess.
My foot in your arse.

270
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,371
Game of cards?
Hatchet Harry?

271
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,916
You're supposed to be getting 
your rest in, boy.

272
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,252
You playing cards tonight, Son?

273
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,089
With Harry?

274
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,799
Don't be silly, Dad.

275
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,552
I wouldn't have anything to do with that.

276
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,272
Where did he get 100 grand?

277
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,607
He's got some adhesive mates.

278
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,233
I mean they're like brothers.

279
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,693
They've tossed up between them.

280
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,446
And JD is his dad and owns 
the whole property?

281
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,698
No mortgage, no debts.

282
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,409
Lock, stock, the fucking lot.

283
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,787
Don't you worry, Harry.
I've got it under control.

284
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,582
Good. You can get this
under control now.

285
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,168
It seems that Lord Appleton Smythe
has run out of money.

286
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,754
And these little beauties 
are up for auction.

287
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,506
But I'm not paying a quarter 
of a million quid for them,

288
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,634
if you know what I mean, Barry.

289
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,845
Make sure we get everything 
from inside the gun cabinet.

290
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,680
I don't wanna know who you use,

291
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,266
as long as they're not complete muppets.

292
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,728
And don't tell them 
what they're worth, Barry.

293
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,739
Right, where was we?

294
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,077
Shotguns? 
What, like guns that fire shot?

295
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,620
You must be the brains, then.

296
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,081
That's right, guns that fire shots.

297
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,918
Make sure you bring everything 
from inside the gun cabinet.

298
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,921
There'll be a load of old guns.
That's all I want.

299
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,298
Everything else outside the cabinet,

300
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,508
you can keep.
It's yours.

301
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,593
Thank you very much.

302
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,470
There'd better be something there for us.

303
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,681
It's a fucking stately home.

304
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,599
Of course there'll be something there.

305
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,684
Like what?

306
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,560
Like fucking antiques.

307
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:04,648
Antiques?
What the fuck do we know about antiques?

308
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,817
- We rob post offices.
- And steal cars.

309
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,611
What the fuck do we know
about antiques, mate?

310
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,906
If it looks old, it's worth money.
Simple.

311
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,785
So stop fucking moaning
and rob the place.

312
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,913
So who's the guv? 
Who are we doing this for?

313
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,542
You're doing it for me,
is all you need to know.

314
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,962
You know because you need to know.

315
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,505
I see.

316
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,134
One of those on-a-need-to-know-basis 
things, is it?

317
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,720
Like one of those James Bond films.

318
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,265
Careful, remember who's giving you 
this job.

319
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,476
Right, I'm off.

320
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,146
Call me when you're done.
Ta-ta.

321
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,068
Fucking Northern monkeys!

322
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,324
I hate these fucking Southern fairies.

323
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,293
<i>Ed has been playing cards 
since he could lift them up,</i>

324
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,712
<i>and he soon discovered
that he had a big advantage.</i>

325
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,257
<i>It's not that he's good with cards 
or even good at counting them.</i>

326
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:16,386
<i>It's that he's good with reading people's reactions,
no matter how subtle.</i>

327
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,638
<i>And everybody has reactions...</i>

328
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,560
<i>especially when it comes to money.</i>

329
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,449
Invitations.

330
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,867
Invitations?

331
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,494
Yeah, invitations.

332
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,789
You know, four pretty white pieces of paper
with your names on them?

333
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,582
Well, we've got 100,000 bits of paper

334
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,750
with the Queen's head on them.

335
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,959
Will that do?

336
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,628
All right, just you.

337
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,422
The others, they can wait next door
in Samoan Jo's.

338
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,508
Samoan Jo's?
You mean the pub?

339
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,927
- Hold on...
- Hold on to your fucking tongue,

340
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,554
and I will hold onto my patience,
okay, sonny?

341
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,475
No one in here tonight but card players,
and I do mean no one.

342
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,109
Evening, Frazer.
Don, Phil.

343
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,404
It's a bit dramatic, isn't it?

344
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,281
Is this supposed to be symbolic?

345
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,325
Apparently, it's for security.

346
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,662
Yeah? I'd have brought me gloves
if I'd have known.

347
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,914
You must be Eddie, JD's son.

348
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,542
You must be Harry.

349
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,336
Sorry, didn't know your father.

350
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,838
Never mind, son.

351
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,299
You just might meet him 
if you carry on like that.

352
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,177
Evening, Tanya, been a while.

353
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,762
All right, Ed?

354
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,285
Right, we call each other Kenny,
okay, Gary?

355
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,370
All right, Kenny.

356
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,372
You gonna put your stocking on,
or what?

357
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,374
I've just spent 220 quid on me hair.

358
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,709
If you think I'm pulling 
a stocking over it,

359
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,960
you're very much mistaken.

360
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,588
You're gonna have to put something on.

361
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,842
This is three card brag, gentlemen.

362
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,677
That means three three's 
are the highest,

363
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,430
then three aces,
then running down accordingly.

364
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:27,225
Then it's a running flush, a run, 
a flush and then a pair.

365
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,477
An open man can't see a blind man,

366
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,148
and it will cost you twice the ante 
to see your opponent.

367
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,234
Now don't fuck around, fellas. 
You all know the rules,

368
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,069
and you know I won't stand for it.

369
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,840
What are you doing?
Put that back.

370
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,009
We're here to rob the guns.

371
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,179
Put it back.
It's crap anyway.

372
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,600
Come on. Come in.

373
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,578
What sort of pub is this, then?

374
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,372
It's a Samoan pub.

375
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,248
What's that?

376
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,001
It's a cocktail.
You asked for a cocktail.

377
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:39,005
No, I asked you to give me 
a refreshing drink.

378
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,258
I wasn't expecting a fucking rain forest.

379
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,303
You could fall in love 
with an orangutan in that.

380
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,555
You want a pint, go to the pub.

381
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,976
I thought this was a pub.

382
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,144
It's a Samoan pub.

383
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,815
Well, whatever it is,
can you get your man to turn the TV down?

384
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,693
You can ask him if you like.
If I was you, I'd leave him well alone.

385
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,779
Here, get rid of that. 
Bring us a Diet Coke.

386
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,907
Excuse me, can you turn that TV down?

387
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,581
No.

388
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,386
Whoa, whoa, Kenny!

389
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,055
What are you doing?

390
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,559
I am trying to find out 
where they keep their money!

391
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,522
You twat, can't you see these people
have got no money?

392
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,025
They can't even afford new furniture.

393
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,402
We've got the guns.
What's the matter with you?

394
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,321
Every time we do a job,
you have to go burning people's feet.

395
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,740
What's wrong with you?

396
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,252
You wanna be more careful,
old fella.

397
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:03,006
You very nearly took 
my man's head clean off with that.

398
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,258
You all right, Kenny?

399
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,342
Kenny?

400
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,434
10 grand, blind.

401
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,190
20 grand, open.

402
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,110
Deep end, eh?

403
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,737
Fold.

404
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,840
Gotcha.

405
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,188
20 grand, open.

406
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,942
I'll fold.

407
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,695
Don't go spending that all at once, boy.

408
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,869
Oh, bloody hell.

409
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:17,914
What?

410
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,333
I thought you said there'd be no staff,
Barry.

411
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,085
Did you get those guns?

412
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,838
You wanna see what they did 
to poor Gary?

413
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,632
Gary. Gary.

414
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,884
I said, did you get those guns?

415
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,011
Yes! We got them!

416
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,597
Good. I'll speak to you later.

417
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,186
Gary, if you can hear me, 
get back in the car now, mate, okay?

418
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,522
Barry. Barry.

419
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,778
Fucking Southern shandy-drinking bastard! 
Gary!

420
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,552
Give me my money!

421
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:57,430
Give me back my money,
you fucking snake!

422
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,935
You give me my money!

423
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,812
Give me back my money!
Give it back!

424
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,942
Wankers!

425
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,074
Come on, you.
Not now, please. Not now.

426
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,034
Oh, you fucking bastard.

427
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,919
You bastard.

428
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,587
Oh, my good God.

429
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,132
We'll take you to the cleaners.

430
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,685
20 grand, open.

431
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,021
£30,000.

432
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,649
Back to you already, Eddie.

433
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,069
50 grand.

434
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,240
80 grand.

435
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:00,785
100 grand.

436
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,537
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

437
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,621
Look, fellas, I know...

438
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,081
I know you're not in.

439
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,834
Which means no one cares
what you know.

440
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,421
250.

441
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,259
That's quite a raise.

442
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,138
That's 150 on my 100.

443
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,558
Yeah, and is there anything else
you wanna say?

444
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,604
As you know, this puts us 
in an awkward position.

445
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,150
I don't have enough to continue.

446
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,068
We will have to see both your cards

447
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,112
if no one loans Eddie the money to continue.

448
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,823
It's a loan or we see both your cards.

449
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,080
I will.

450
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,293
You will what?

451
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,255
I will loan you the money.

452
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:00,178
No, I think I'd rather
just turn them over.

453
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,306
I'm not interested
in what you would rather.

454
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,099
I wanna keep going.

455
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,227
I'm also offering you the money.

456
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,815
So we don't have to turn them over, 
because you can borrow.

457
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,611
I need 250 grand.

458
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:20,531
No, you need 500 grand 
to see me.

459
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,202
That's if I want to see you.

460
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,872
Well, you're gonna have a problem
carrying on, ain't you?

461
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,460
I'll see you.

462
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,422
Okay, before I loan you this

463
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,217
I expect, if you lose, of course,

464
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,638
my money back within a week.
Crystal?

465
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,015
That's Sunday, okay?

466
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:15,753
Is that it?

467
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,131
Now let's see his fucking cards.

468
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,080
Hello, boy.
Feeling a bit poorly?

469
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:36,000
I know your friends are responsible

470
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,668
for most of the cash.

471
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:41,130
So, I'm gonna give you 
one week to find it.

472
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,342
Otherwise, I will take a finger

473
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,969
off each of you 
and your friends' hands

474
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,097
for every day that passes 
without payment.

475
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,558
And then when you run out of digits,

476
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:56,020
your dad's bar,
and who knows what then.

477
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,147
All right, my son?

478
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,999
This doesn't look good.

479
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,047
<i>He then proceeded to explain</i>

480
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,216
<i>the unfortunate position
they were in.</i>

481
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,386
<i>Harry was going to start sizing up 
all their fingers in a week,</i>

482
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,473
<i>because he knew there was no way 
Ed could settle that debt on his own.</i>

483
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,353
<i>Harry saw it as their money on the table, 
so it was also their debt off the table.</i>

484
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,230
<i>Ed would hate admit it,</i>

485
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,357
<i>but he could have kissed
the old bastard for that.</i>

486
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,778
<i>If he said he wanted to settle the debt 
on his own, it would have been a lie.</i>

487
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:49,907
Now, I wish to Christ he would have 
let me settle the debt on my own.

488
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:52,910
I'm gonna kill him!

489
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,246
Stop fucking about, Tom,

490
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,624
and think about what we're gonna do.
Now sit down.

491
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,131
What's all the fuss about Harry?

492
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,842
Why don't we just boycott the payment?

493
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,680
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry.

494
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,808
Once there was this geezer 
called Smithy Robinson

495
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,602
who worked for Harry,

496
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,271
but it was rumored
that he was on the take.

497
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,232
Harry's invited Smithy round 
for an explanation.

498
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:26,694
Smithy didn't do a very good job.
Within a minute,

499
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,947
Harry's lost his rag, reached out 
for the nearest thing at hand,

500
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,200
which happened to be 
a 15-inch black rubber cock.

501
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:37,622
He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy
to death with it.

502
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,919
Now that was seen
as a pleasant way to go.

503
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,715
Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay 
if you owe.

504
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,095
Don't worry, I'll think of something.

505
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:26,003
"Golf. The best way 
to spoil a good walk."

506
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,680
Winston Churchill said that.

507
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,766
I say it's a dog-eat-dog world,

508
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,352
and I've got bigger teeth than you two.

509
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,816
I think our friend 
is trying to tell us something.

510
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,194
Perhaps not. Perhaps I should take 
another swing just to make sure.

511
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,445
Give me a five iron, John.

512
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,114
Certainly, Dog.

513
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,703
Now, keep still.

514
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,631
Yes, Gordon, is there something 
you'd like to tell us?

515
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,883
It's in the fireplace.

516
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,677
Shut it, you idiot!

517
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,596
Yes, Gordon, you were saying?

518
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:21,267
It's in the fireplace. Just pull it out.
It's in the bottom.

519
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:25,438
It's in the fireplace, Plank. Just pull it out.
It's in the bottom.

520
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,816
Oh, Dog, I think you want 
to have a look at this.

521
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,487
You gonna let me down now?

522
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,655
No.

523
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,074
I'm not finished with you yet.

524
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,909
Steel.

525
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,957
Help, help, help!

526
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,504
Oh, Dog.

527
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,089
<i>It's all up to you, audience.</i> 

528
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:55,217
<i>You have to decide, yes, 
you have to decide</i>

529
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,844
<i>who the winner is going to be.</i>

530
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,346
Who the hell's that?
It's only 12:00.

531
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,809
Use the cage,
that's what it's there for.

532
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,356
Who is it?

533
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,449
We have got security for a reason, Willie.

534
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,911
Chill, Winston.
It's only Plank.

535
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,081
This weed's getting quite a rep,
you know, fellas.

536
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:29,293
All right?
Easy. Jesus!

537
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,505
Never saw you there.

538
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,882
Hello, love.
Enjoying yourself?

539
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,885
Is she compos?

540
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,011
What do you think?

541
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:43,307
Boo!

542
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,351
Fuck me.

543
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,770
Clean that up, Charles.

544
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,480
Sod you. You clean it up.

545
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:53,776
Sorry, fellas, but that stupid cow 
scared the fucking life out of me!

546
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,654
Never mind.
Can you just sit down?

547
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,531
Stay out of the way?

548
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,327
Look, how much is it you want?

549
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,621
I'm after a half weight.

550
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,415
Right, well, that's £1,500 then.

551
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,751
Pass the scales, Willie.

552
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,755
Give us some gear, J.

553
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:21,679
Any chance of actually seeing the money?

554
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,857
The odds are 100-to-one.

555
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,109
All as we need is 5 grand.

556
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,529
I'd rather put my money
on a three-legged rocking horse.

557
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,365
The odds are 100-to-one
for a good reason, Bacon.

558
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,783
You won't win.

559
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,369
Where's Eddie?

560
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,037
Where do you think?

561
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:50,040
The bottom of a bottle. 
And has been for two days.

562
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,458
It's hit him hard.

563
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,210
Yeah, it's hit us all hard.

564
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,505
Yeah, but he's got to tell his dad 
he's about to lose his bar.

565
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,466
Listen to this one.
You open up a company

566
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,052
- called Arse Ticklers Faggots Fan Club.
- You what? 

567
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,889
You take out an advert
in the back page of some gay mag,

568
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:08,809
advertising the latest 
in arse-intruding dildos.

569
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,687
You sell it with, I don't know,

570
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,939
"Does what no other dildo can do until now.

571
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,066
"The latest and greatest 
in sexual technology.

572
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,068
"Guaranteed results or your money back."
All that bollocks.

573
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:21,238
Now these dills cost 25 quid a pop.

574
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:24,575
That's a snip for the amount of pleasure 
they're gonna give the recipients.

575
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,745
But they send their checks 
to the other company name,

576
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,749
nothing offensive, Bobbie's Bits, 
or something, for 25 quid.

577
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:35,461
You take that 25 quid,
you stick it in the bank until it clears.

578
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,504
Now this is the smart bit.

579
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:42,301
You send back the check for £25 
from the other company name,

580
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,845
Arse Ticklers Faggots Fan Club, saying,

581
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,723
"We're sorry, and we couldn't get 
the supplies from America,

582
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,099
"because they've run out of stock."

583
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,144
Now you see how many people
cash that check.

584
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,855
Not a single soul.

585
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,732
Because who wants 
their bank manager to know

586
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,069
they tickle arse 
when they're not paying in checks?

587
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,696
So how long do you have to wait 
till you see the return?

588
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,615
Probably no more than four weeks.

589
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,866
A month?

590
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,119
So what fucking good is that 
if we need it in six...

591
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:10,996
No, five days.

592
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,999
Well, it's still a good idea.

593
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,796
He may know we smoke a lot 
and burn a bit of profit,

594
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,800
but he can't have any idea 
how much hard currency we've accumulated.

595
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:26,053
I don't know.
Do you know?

596
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,099
We can just slice it off the top.

597
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,936
You guys gotta realize who this chap is. 

598
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,523
He might look a bit silly, 
but he's a fucking lunatic.

599
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,818
And if he gets the slightest inkling 
we're not throwing straight dice,

600
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:45,531
then you and me are gonna know what the 
sharp side of a kebab knife feels like.

601
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,658
So you know these geezers well?

602
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,742
Well enough.

603
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,495
I've been buying gear off one of them 
for a couple of years.

604
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,913
So, what are they like then?

605
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:56,667
Poofs. Nothing heavy.
Four public schoolboys. Soft as shite.

606
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:21,191
<i>They ponce around in funny hippy clothes
all day, talking bollocks.</i>

607
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,193
<i>They're just good at growing weed,
that's all.</i>

608
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,530
<i>Business has got bigger
than what they can keep up with.</i>

609
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,532
<i>Well, they can't all be stupid,
can they?</i>

610
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,619
Think about it. They've got a container
load of cash in shoeboxes.

611
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,246
<i>They're selling class-A gear.</i>

612
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,207
<i>Don't you think there might be someone
sensible involved?</i>

613
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,333
<i>What about security?</i>

614
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,045
<i>There's one steel gate as you go in, 
but they never lock it.</i>

615
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,546
What do you mean, never lock it?

616
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,839
What have they got it there for then?

617
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,258
I must have been there 50 times.
It's never locked.

618
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,718
They're not suspicious.

619
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,344
Everyone who goes there's a toff.

620
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,096
They're all into that karma crap.

621
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:54,141
"If I don't harm nobody,
nobody harms me" stuff.

622
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,642
No way they can get back to you?

623
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,729
Even if they could, they'd be too shit scared.
I'm a geezer.

624
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,482
They got no muscle.
Gutless faggots.

625
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,318
Fancy one?

626
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,696
What's all the flapping about?

627
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,239
You told the old man yet?

628
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,200
Hoping I won't need to.

629
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,787
I've got a plan.
Now listen carefully.

630
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,549
Hello, boys.

631
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:28,759
Harry.

632
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,427
Do you want a drink?

633
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,180
Hello, my son,
do you want a lolly?

634
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,015
Piss off, you nonce.

635
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,767
Oi! Watch it.

636
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,145
No thanks, Harry.
We're both all right.

637
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,980
Nice shooter.

638
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,357
Yeah, one of a pair.

639
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,360
Holland & Holland.
Do you want to hold it?

640
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,529
No, not my thing.
Thanks, Harry.

641
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,281
Business good?
I imagine that's why I'm here.

642
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:54,743
Four young fellas got in deeper 
than they could handle.

643
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,787
They owe me half a million pound.

644
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,580
How much?

645
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,040
Half a million.

646
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,044
I'm game.

647
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,131
Me, too.

648
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,967
Oh, God.

649
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,635
Right.

650
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:15,305
We hit them 
as soon as they come back.

651
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,516
We'll be prepared, waiting.

652
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:20,853
And they're armed.

653
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,729
What was that?
Armed?

654
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,815
What do you mean, armed?

655
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,316
Armed with what?

656
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,486
Bad breath, colorful language,
feather duster...

657
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:30,779
What do you think 
they're gonna be armed with?

658
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,114
Guns, you tit.

659
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,576
Guns? You never said anything 
about guns.

660
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,245
A minute ago this was the safest job
in the world.

661
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,664
Now it's turning
into a bad day in Bosnia.

662
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,041
Soap, stop being such a mincer.

663
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,210
I've thought about that and...

664
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,336
And what exactly?

665
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:51,300
And all we have to do 
is find out who's carrying them.

666
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:55,179
Carrying them? Well, they could all 
be carrying them for what we know.

667
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,557
No. Only one of them carries them
going to the job.

668
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,268
So I assume the same one 
will be carrying them

669
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,561
when they come back from the job.

670
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,479
Oh, you assume, do you?

671
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,566
And what do they say about assumption 
being the brother of all fuck-ups?

672
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,067
It's the mother of all fuck-ups, 
stupid.

673
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,862
Well, brother, mother,
any other sucker,

674
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,530
it don't make any difference.

675
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:19,203
They're still fucking guns, 
and they still fire fucking bullets.

676
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,039
Soap, if you have a better idea

677
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:26,960
how to get £500,000 in the next few days,
let us know.

678
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,342
In the meantime, Tom, you talk to 
Nick the Bubble about shifting the weed.

679
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,558
- Weed?
- No, it's not normal weed.

680
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,394
It's some fucked-up-skunk,
class-A,

681
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,313
I-can't-think-let-alone-move shit.

682
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,190
Doesn't sound very good me.

683
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,318
No, neither me.
But it depends what flicks your switch.

684
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,571
And the light is on
and burning brightly for the masses.

685
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,907
Anyway, do you know anyone?

686
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,116
I know a man, yes.

687
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,370
Rory Breaker.

688
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,373
Not that madman with an Afro?

689
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,333
I don't want anything to do with him.

690
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,253
You won't have to.
Just get me a sample.

691
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,296
No can do.

692
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,300
What's that?
A place near Katmandu?

693
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:16,468
Meet me halfway, mate.

694
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,137
Look, it's all completely chicken soup.

695
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,848
- It's what?
- It's kosher as Christmas.

696
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,685
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.

697
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,437
Yeah, well, never mind that. 
I'm gonna need some artillery, too.

698
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,189
Couple of sawn-off shotguns.

699
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,942
This is a bit heavy.
This is London, not the Lebanon.

700
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,777
Who do you think I am?

701
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,404
I think you're Nick the Greek.

702
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:38,282
Hold those two.

703
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,245
I don't normally have anything to do 
with weed, Nick.

704
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,497
But if it is what he says it is,

705
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,542
I'll take it off him
for 3.5 grand a key.

706
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,128
That is if it is what he says it is.

707
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,839
I don't want to see it 
after a sample,

708
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,174
I don't want to touch it 
after a sample.

709
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,386
I'll leave you in the capable hands
of Nathan here.

710
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,722
He'll sort out the details.

711
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,348
But just let me tell you one thing.

712
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,981
If the milk turns out to be sour,

713
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,983
I ain't the kind of pussy 
to drink it.

714
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,071
Do you know what I mean?

715
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,037
Rory Breaker.

716
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,122
Rory? Yeah, I know Rory.

717
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,624
He's not to be underestimated.

718
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,501
He's a funny looking fucker, I know.

719
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,504
But you've got to look past the hair 
and the cute cuddly thing.

720
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,715
It's all a deceptive facade.

721
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,762
A few nights ago,
Rory's Roger iron rusted.

722
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:45,974
He's gone down the Battle Cruiser 
to watch the end of a football game.

723
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,519
No one's watching the custard, 
so he switches the channel over.

724
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,772
A fat geezer's north opens.

725
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,067
And he wanders up
and turns the liza over.

726
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,944
"Now fuck off 
and watch it somewhere else."

727
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,157
Rory knows claret is imminent, 
but doesn't wanna miss the end of the game.

728
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,660
So calm as a coma,
picks up a fire extinguisher,

729
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:08,622
walks straight past the jam rolls 
who are ready for action

730
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,707
and plonks it outside the entrance.

731
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:15,045
He then orders an Aristotle of the most 
ping-pong tiddly in the nuclear sub

732
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,381
and switches back to his footer.

733
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,509
"That's fucking it", says the geezer.

734
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,761
"That's fucking what?", says Rory.

735
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,806
And he gobs out a mouthful of booze
covering Fatty.

736
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,392
He flicks a flaming match 
into his bird's nest,

737
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:31,395
and the geezer's lit up
like a leaking gas pipe.

738
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:35,857
Rory, unfazed, turns back to his game.
His team's won, too.

739
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,651
Four-nil.

740
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:54,543
Oi!

741
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,129
Is your hair supposed to look like that?

742
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,255
All right, short stuff?

743
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,132
Never mind "short stuff."

744
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,758
Listen, the next time 
we do a job like this,

745
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,301
we're gonna want more money, Barry.

746
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:06,179
Or we're going back to post offices 
and cars. Fuck that.

747
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,973
Where's the others?

748
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,600
There was no others.

749
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:13,019
Stop fucking around. 
The others, the old ones.

750
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,271
I don't know what you mean.

751
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,522
There were two old guns there.

752
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,107
Where are they now?

753
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,109
Not in the cabinet, there wasn't.

754
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,070
There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets
the butler was carrying.

755
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:23,697
But they were ours, we sold them.

756
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,866
Well, you better unsell them, sharpish.

757
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,659
We had to sell them.
We needed the money!

758
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,078
I'm not fucking interested!

759
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:33,832
If you don't want to be counting the fingers
you haven't got

760
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,002
I suggest you get those guns, quick!

761
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:22,631
Jesus.

762
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,800
If I pick them up,
will they stay in one piece?

763
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,636
Where'd you get them?

764
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,804
I got contacts.

765
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,015
Listen, Tom, you point them at me,

766
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,184
I'll shit myself or do 
whatever you say to do.

767
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,894
Either way you get the desired effect.

768
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,605
Oh, they look very nice, I agree...

769
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,899
but they're lacking in criminal credibility,
ain't they?

770
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,400
I might get laughed at.

771
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,069
How much do you want for these muskets?

772
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,278
£700 each.

773
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:48,198
What's that?
A pound for every year they've been about?

774
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,993
I know they're antiques,
but I ain't paying antique prices.

775
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,623
They're a bit long, ain't they?

776
00:47:56,958 --> 00:48:00,627
Sawn-offs are out.
People want a bit more range these days.

777
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:02,712
Range?

778
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:05,131
I don't want to blow the arse 
out of this country, granted.

779
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:08,468
But I don't want anyone
blowing a raspberry at me, either.

780
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,554
I want to look fucking mean.

781
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,931
Of course you'll look mean.

782
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,224
You'll look really scary.

783
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,433
Anyway, enough about that.

784
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,310
What about this geezer
who sells drugs?

785
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,771
Rory Breaker's standing by.

786
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:23,024
You stand to make a lot of money,
tubby Tommy.

787
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,116
I understand if this has come 
as a bit of a shock,

788
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,412
but let me tell you how this can be resolved 
by you, the good father.

789
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:36,871
Go on.

790
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,165
He likes your bar.

791
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:40,667
Yes?

792
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:42,669
He wants your bar.

793
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:44,629
And?

794
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,300
Do you want me to draw you a picture?

795
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:51,761
Look, that boy doesn't know 
his arsehole from his ear hole.

796
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,764
This is my bar.
It's got nothing to do with him.

797
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,017
What, and I care?

798
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,603
Remember, you do have
the luxurious advantage

799
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,938
of being able to sustain 
your son's life.

800
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:06,192
And you do have a reputation, 
so I'll choose my words very carefully.

801
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,195
You tell Harry to go fuck himself.

802
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,619
Now...

803
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,459
I'll put that down to shock.
Only once.

804
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:27,464
Only once can I or shall I 
let you get away with that.

805
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:31,509
Your son's got three days 
to find half a mil.

806
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,472
But make up your mind
which you prefer,

807
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:38,224
your bar or your son.

808
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,732
<i>Plank goes in first.</i>

809
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,776
<i>There's a cage, but it's never locked.</i>

810
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,569
<i>- Is it, Plank?
- Never.</i> 

811
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:50,737
<i>It don't wanna be.</i>

812
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,158
<i>All right, once he's got himself set, 
he gets the rest of us in.</i>

813
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,243
<i>Now we get nasty with a couple of them.</i>

814
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,411
<i>Shit them up, gag them, whatever.</i>

815
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,998
Now these wankers shouldn't give us
any problems.

816
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:05,335
But like any cowboys,
there'll be a few tools lying around.

817
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:09,130
When the job's done,
we come straight back here and unload.

818
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,925
And Robert's your father's brother.

819
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,885
Everyone savvy?

820
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,387
Sweet.

821
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:17,889
Have a look at these.

822
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,102
And what are we supposed do with these?

823
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,689
Put them on your head, stupid.

824
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,148
Christ.

825
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,902
If you think I'm gonna turn up there 
clean-shaven and greet them

826
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,780
with a grin on my face, 
you got another thing coming.

827
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,532
Now these fellas,
they're your neighbors.

828
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:39,577
I thought it might be a good idea 
to disguise ourselves a little.

829
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,456
Right. Yeah, good thinking, Soap.
Well done.

830
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,251
I brought weapons as well.

831
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,795
Weapons? 
What do you mean, weapons?

832
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,674
These.

833
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,509
Jesus.

834
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:57,095
Let's keep them covered up, eh?

835
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,558
Couldn't you have got anything 
a bit bigger?

836
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,561
What, like that?

837
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,896
What do you think?

838
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,649
I think you need help.

839
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:13,778
Bar steward, can we have 
a couple of drinks, please?

840
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:17,866
Have you seen your dad? 
Hatchet sent one of his men around.

841
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,326
Oh, shit. When?

842
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,079
Crazy...

843
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,927
Where did you get these?
A fucking museum?

844
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,554
Nick the Greek.

845
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,308
How much did you part with?

846
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:44,809
£700 for the pair.

847
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,519
Drachmas, I hope.

848
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,606
I'd feel safer with a chicken drumstick.

849
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,442
These are gonna do more harm than good.

850
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,946
Jesus, Tom, do these work?

851
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,782
Don't know.
Look nice though, don't they?

852
00:51:58,866 --> 00:51:59,866
I rather like them.

853
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,951
That's top of the list 
of priorities, that is.

854
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,203
Ladies...

855
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:06,372
back to more important issues,
if you don't mind.

856
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,792
We have only got two real guns.

857
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,794
Apparently, that's what they are.

858
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,129
So we find a good place 
to hide next door,

859
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,006
we wait till it sounds 
like the right time,

860
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,341
then we jack-in-the-box,

861
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:19,177
look nasty and stuff,
cocoon them in gaffer tape,

862
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:23,723
nick their van, swap the gear into 
the new van and bring it all back here.

863
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,601
As long as we're all out 
of our hiding places quickly,

864
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,062
it's the last thing they're gonna expect.

865
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,439
Oh, and if Tom or anyone else for that matter

866
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:33,274
feels like giving them a bit of a kicking,

867
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,568
I'm sure it won't do any harm.

868
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:39,322
Yeah, little bit of pain 
never hurt anybody,

869
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,490
if you know what I mean.

870
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:45,119
Also, I think knives are a good idea.

871
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:47,664
Big, fuck-off, shiny ones.

872
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,251
Ones that look like 
they could skin a crocodile.

873
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:54,420
Knives are good because 
they don't make any noise.

874
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,839
And the less noise they make,

875
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,174
the more likely we are to use them.

876
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,510
Shit them right up.

877
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,428
Makes it look like we're serious.

878
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,890
Guns for show, knives for a pro.

879
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,812
Soap, is there something 
we should know about you?

880
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,147
I'm not sure what's more worrying,

881
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,774
the job or your past.

882
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:19,612
Come on, girls.

883
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:36,129
Where the fuck are they going?
Shift a piano?

884
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,715
I thought this was meant to be a robbery.

885
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:41,009
Where did they get those outfits?

886
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,635
Not a bad idea, that.

887
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,014
All right, it's Plank. 
Is Willie there?

888
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,725
No. I'm afraid he's not.
He's out at the moment.

889
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,560
<i>Perhaps you can help.</i>

890
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:53,771
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, 
if you know what I mean.

891
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,940
Look. If you could just open the door,

892
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:57,609
so I could talk without shouting.

893
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,652
<i>I can't help you, Plank.</i>

894
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,739
I think you'll find it 
is in your interest.

895
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,324
Hold on, okay?

896
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,743
Look, Willie, it's Plank outside for you.

897
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,369
He says it's in our interest.

898
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:11,414
Listen, I don't care 
if it's King-fucking-Kong!

899
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,791
He's not coming in here, 
not today.

900
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:17,295
Hold on. We are in business, 
and correct me if I'm wrong,

901
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,422
but that is business.

902
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:23,134
Corrected. That's a walking accident 
that we can do without.

903
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,888
Jesus, he's okay.
He knows only to buy weights now.

904
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,891
We're looking at at least 
a couple of thou.

905
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,018
What do you think, Winston?

906
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,939
Willie, this is the last time,
all right?

907
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,107
But you and the money
are going out the back.

908
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,943
If he knows you're here,
he'll be all day.

909
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,195
Now just clear this shit up.

910
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,198
- What, now?
- Yes. Now! 

911
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,825
Just get rid of him quick.

912
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,869
All right, just coming.

913
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,249
What the fuck is he doing?

914
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,506
Come on, I can't wait out here all day.

915
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,883
<i>All right, just coming.</i>

916
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,349
I thought you was gonna leave me
out there all day.

917
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,434
I didn't know you were 
a removals man, Plank.

918
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:15,603
Lives and learns, don't you?

919
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,313
You keep the gates locked now, do you?

920
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:20,608
Sorry, gotta do business like this now.

921
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,485
Can't be too careful these days.

922
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,904
I know. Shut it!

923
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,572
You say a fucking word, 
the right ear goes.

924
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:27,782
Another one, then your left.

925
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:28,825
What are you doing, Plank?

926
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:29,993
What do you think I'm doing?

927
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,120
Hang on, what are you doing?

928
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:35,790
Unlock the gate. All right, 
I said unlock the fucking gate!

929
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,459
That's it! Go, go, go!
Fucking move!

930
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:43,923
What the fuck's going on?

931
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,342
Just hang on, I've got the keys.

932
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:49,554
The gate's locked!
I don't believe the fucking gate's locked!

933
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:50,847
What have you done to Fauntleroy?

934
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,016
I didn't touch him.
He just passed out.

935
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,892
Don't just stand there. 
Get that fucking door shut.

936
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:57,103
You want the world to see us?

937
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:01,107
What's going on down there?

938
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:04,694
Shit.

939
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,786
Charles, get the rifle out.

940
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,956
We're being fucked.

941
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,374
It must be this one.

942
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:19,876
Hold that gun.

943
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,669
Plank, give me the keys.
Give me the keys, Plank.

944
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:24,422
Don't point it at me, bollocks, 
point it in there.

945
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,759
Planks of wood.
I'm working with fucking planks of wood.

946
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:28,926
Shit.

947
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,639
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck's that?

948
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:34,807
It's me Bren gun.

949
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:38,728
Don't you think you could have brought 
something a little bit more practical?

950
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,898
Don't none of you slags move. 
I'll kill the fucking lot of you!

951
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:44,233
Who are you gonna kill, Plank? 
There's no one fucking there.

952
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,448
They fucking shot me.

953
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,866
Well, shoot them back.

954
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,497
Jesus, Plank. 
Couldn't you have got smokeless cartridges?

955
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,082
I can't see a bloody thing.

956
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:01,334
Shit.

957
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,252
I've been shot.
I don't fucking believe this.

958
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:05,171
Could everyone stop getting shot?

959
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,091
John, sit down
and patch yourself up.

960
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:10,343
You tart, it's a fucking air rifle.

961
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:18,935
What the fuck was that?

962
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,269
Well, that was the Bren gun.

963
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,437
If you fire that gun again,

964
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,147
you're a dead man.
Understand? Dead.

965
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:24,982
No ifs, no buts, 
you're a fucking dead man!

966
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,109
All right, all right.

967
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:30,029
I've got the bollock ache with this. 
Where's me fucking gun?

968
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,993
All right, now that I've got 
your attention,

969
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,496
firstly I'm gonna blow his toes off.

970
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,042
- Shit.
- There go his toes. 

971
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,962
Now if you want me out of here 
in five minutes flat,

972
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,380
open the fucking gate,

973
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,924
'cause I'm gonna blow his leg off.

974
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:53,469
They're gonna fucking kill us 
if we do, man.

975
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:56,305
Poor J will certainly get it 
if we don't. He's serious.

976
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,766
I'm losing patience.
Hurry up, girls.

977
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:01,227
It's all right.
All fucking right.

978
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,606
Willie, he doesn't know
you're here. Just...

979
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,234
Sort something out.

980
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,082
And all your friends,
there's a good lad.

981
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,252
There's only three of us here.

982
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,171
I don't believe you.
Fuck it, I'm gonna blow his leg off.

983
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,589
I mean it.

984
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,757
It's only three of us.

985
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:32,842
Plank?

986
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,261
Yeah. One of them is out.

987
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:40,808
Now open the gate.

988
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:05,875
Up, up, up.
There's a good lad.

989
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,062
John, get them tied up.

990
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,271
Plank, where's the money?

991
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,482
There. In those shoeboxes.

992
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,044
- Where?
- Out the back. 

993
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,505
- And the weed?
- Out the back. 

994
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,590
- Point!
- With what? 

995
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:56,425
Your fucking hands, now!

996
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,677
I'm tied up.

997
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,513
Well, nod your head or something.

998
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:04,308
Check it out.
Plank, get Paul out of that van, lively.

999
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:21,993
Knife.

1000
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:29,917
I'm gonna cut him.
Make sure he knows he's dead.

1001
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,003
How you doing, Mick?
How do you think I'm doing?

1002
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,714
He's fucking nearly chopped me arm off.

1003
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:44,765
Jesus Christ.

1004
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:53,399
Lenny, what the fuck's 
been going on here?

1005
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,443
Shut up, you idiot.

1006
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,737
It's Hanukkah.

1007
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,197
Well, don't just stand there.

1008
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:02,616
Have you got the bags? 
Can you fit it all in?

1009
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,160
It's a lot.

1010
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:07,872
I can't get Epping Forest
in my van.

1011
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,374
Can't? 
I don't wanna hear "can't."

1012
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:11,542
Bollocks to can't.

1013
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:14,670
You'll fit it all in
if you have to make two trips.

1014
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:20,718
Bollocks.

1015
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:23,679
You've got a ticket already.

1016
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:26,057
And if you don't move it, 
we will move it for you.

1017
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,141
I'll only be a minute.

1018
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,601
You've already been 15.

1019
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,727
Look.

1020
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:31,354
Come and have a look.

1021
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,730
At what, exactly?

1022
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,524
- Well, the van's half full.
- So? 

1023
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,861
So, all I've got to do 
is fill it up,

1024
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,863
- put you in it...
- What?

1025
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,618
And I'm off.

1026
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,379
Do you think you can carry more 
than one bag this time?

1027
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,339
I can't.
My neck, Dog.

1028
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,633
How many more bags?

1029
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:01,884
Just a couple.

1030
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:05,179
Mick, you dead yet?

1031
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:10,851
I'll be all right once I've dealt 
with that lanky prick.

1032
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,145
Do it quietly.

1033
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,401
It's time I say,
"Good night, nurse."

1034
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,697
Where the fuck did she come from?

1035
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,414
That is it. Tie her up.
We're out of here.

1036
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,989
What are you doing, Ed?

1037
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,491
Do you want one?

1038
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:51,118
No, I fucking don't.
You cannot make a cup of tea, Edward.

1039
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:54,663
The entire British Empire 
was built on cups of tea.

1040
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:56,499
Yeah, and look what happened to that.

1041
01:03:56,883 --> 01:03:59,877
And if you think I'm going to war 
without one, mate, you're mistaken.

1042
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,921
Going to war with what?

1043
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:05,132
Have you forgotten those guns,
you dozy prat?

1044
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:28,489
You won't get away with this.

1045
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,701
Paul, what's that?

1046
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:33,911
It's a traffic warden.

1047
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,371
I can see it's a fucking traffic warden.

1048
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,248
What's he doing 
in the back of the van?

1049
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:39,583
He was gonna call the cozzers.

1050
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,962
Fair enough,
we'll deal with him later.

1051
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,217
How are we doing, Tom?

1052
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,760
Right as rain.

1053
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:52,054
I'm just gonna take care of the cabs.

1054
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,597
Keep us posted.

1055
01:04:57,686 --> 01:05:00,229
All right, mate,
do you do airports?

1056
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,693
Where the hell are we gonna hide?

1057
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,364
Don't complicate things. 
Just hide.

1058
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,170
We're on.

1059
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,023
Cor, they weigh a pound or two.

1060
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:45,691
Shut up and back up!

1061
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,528
Spin round, big boy.

1062
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,408
What the fuck?

1063
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,869
Stay down!
Stay down!

1064
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,629
Tie them up, tape them up,
hands and face.

1065
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,297
On the floor!

1066
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,050
Bend over the fucking desk.

1067
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:19,308
Keys. I want keys. Now!

1068
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:22,978
I'll find you.

1069
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,356
Course you will, sweetheart.

1070
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,899
I'll find you.

1071
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,069
What do you think this is, 
fucking hide-and-seek?

1072
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,529
That one.
Search that one.

1073
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:47,044
Right, I'll see you in the van 
when you've finished with handsome here.

1074
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,022
Jesus, that wasn't too bad, was it?

1075
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:15,197
When the bottle in my arse has contracted,
I'll let you know.

1076
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,825
Bacon, see what we've got.

1077
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:20,327
Let's have a butchers, eh?

1078
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,459
We've hit the jackpot, lads.

1079
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,672
We've got God knows how much 
of this stinking weed...

1080
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,591
a shit load of cash...

1081
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,220
and a traffic warden.

1082
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,346
What?

1083
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:44,101
Jesus, Ed, we got a traffic warden.

1084
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,063
I think he's still alive.

1085
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:50,983
He's got claret coming out of him somewhere.

1086
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:52,735
What did they want with a traffic warden?

1087
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,945
I don't know,
but I don't think we need him.

1088
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,030
Knock him out and dump him
at the lights.

1089
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:58,574
Knock him out?
What do you mean, knock him out?

1090
01:07:58,658 --> 01:07:59,700
Knock him out with what?

1091
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:02,244
I don't know!
Use your imagination!

1092
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,460
Don't touch him up.
Knock him out!

1093
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:11,086
I'll knock you out in a minute.

1094
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:12,713
Look, you want to knock him out,

1095
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,256
you knock him out.

1096
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,593
I fucking hate traffic wardens.

1097
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,149
It's about time you gave 
my young friends a visit, Chris.

1098
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:38,113
Tomorrow's the day 
and mum's the word.

1099
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:39,907
Now I can't have that,
can I, Baz?

1100
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,950
No, Harry, you can't.

1101
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,952
I mean, it's a liberty.

1102
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:47,623
And I can't have a liberty taken,
can I, Chris?

1103
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:49,541
No, Harry, you can't.

1104
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:53,212
I mean, it's enough 
to give me the arsehole.

1105
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,216
And I can't have the arsehole,
can I, boys?

1106
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,343
No, Harry, you can't.

1107
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,227
Right, that's it.
We're done.

1108
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,271
- We're off.
- Here, Ed.

1109
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:13,398
Are you sure it's a good idea 
taking this back to yours?

1110
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,775
Well, it's the only place 
we can take it,

1111
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:15,943
and it's the last place 
they're gonna look.

1112
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:17,027
Anyway, fuck it!

1113
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,862
The battle is over
and the war is won.

1114
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:21,615
Now, Tom.
You take this to Nick the Bubble,

1115
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,283
then we get rid of it quick.

1116
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,550
It's skunk, and it's as good
as it gets.

1117
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:44,680
All right, we'll take it.

1118
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:46,139
Half price.

1119
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,017
I don't think he'll like that.

1120
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:52,521
You said 3.5 a key,
and you know that's a good price.

1121
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:54,439
It was yesterday I said three and a half,

1122
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,900
and now it's today
if I'm not mistaken.

1123
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:59,653
We'll take it tomorrow, half price.

1124
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,239
If he wants to get rid of it quick,

1125
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,365
he'll have to take it.

1126
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,449
Now look...

1127
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,118
I've got a race coming up in a minute,

1128
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,121
so if you'd just be kind enough to...

1129
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:20,549
Lenny, take that round to Snow White 
and the three little chemists.

1130
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:22,551
They should have a gander of that.

1131
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,636
I want a second opinion.

1132
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:31,727
Hang on a minute, Nathan.
Something stinks.

1133
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:34,021
Yeah, your fucking aftershave.

1134
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,939
Fuck you, funny man.

1135
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,984
For God's sake.
Help me.

1136
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:43,071
I'm in pain.
I'm in so much pain! Jesus.

1137
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,740
Go in slowly, Nathan.

1138
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:46,867
Fuck you, funny man, you go first.

1139
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:49,202
Just get the fuck in there, 
will you?

1140
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,913
I want this house searched for bugs.

1141
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,456
I mean, I want it stripped.

1142
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:53,707
Where's the point in that?

1143
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,084
Even if there was a bug, 
they'd have taken it with them.

1144
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,420
It's a bit late for you 
to start thinking, John.

1145
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,089
If it's a possibility,
that's good enough for me.

1146
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,674
And when you've stripped this place,

1147
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:07,137
I want every slag this side of Ceylon 
pulled in and tortured badly.

1148
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:09,932
I want to know 
who's responsible for this.

1149
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:13,101
Otherwise, I'm gonna hold you responsible.

1150
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:22,235
Not a bad day.

1151
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,864
That pile takes care of Harry.

1152
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:28,784
What's left over?

1153
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:31,036
Give me half a chance to count it.

1154
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,831
What about this gear then, eh?

1155
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,298
What, you want a toke on that?

1156
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:45,550
No, I don't think I want any 
of that horrible shit.

1157
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,428
Can we lock up 
and get drunk now, please?

1158
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:54,267
We shot one of them in the throat.

1159
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:55,394
What do you want, a medal?

1160
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:59,481
I'll shoot you in the fucking throat 
if I don't get my ganja back.

1161
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:03,443
The one you shot, 
is he still in there now?

1162
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:04,945
No, it was another one.

1163
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,405
That's more like it.

1164
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:08,240
Where is he?

1165
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,076
Well, they took him with.

1166
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:13,620
No, he's still alive.

1167
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:16,832
What did you shoot him with?
An air gun?

1168
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:26,717
Look, we grow weed.
We're not mercenaries.

1169
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,761
You don't say.

1170
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:31,680
Who could it be?

1171
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,515
Where do we start, Rory?

1172
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:34,850
Mr. Breaker.

1173
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,520
Today my name is Mr. Breaker.

1174
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,481
You think this is a coincidence?

1175
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:43,316
This white shite steals my things

1176
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,360
and thinks that he can sell it 
back to me!

1177
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,988
He's got less brains than you,
Lenny!

1178
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,032
Get Nick...

1179
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:54,953
the greasy wop...
Greek bastard round here now.

1180
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:58,206
If he's still stupid enough 
to be on this planet.

1181
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:34,469
Your stupidity might be 
your one saving grace.

1182
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:35,637
Uh?

1183
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,848
Don't "uh" me, Greek boy!

1184
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:41,101
How is it your fucking stupid,
soon-to-be-dead friends

1185
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:43,812
thought that they might be able 
to steal my cannabis,

1186
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,939
and then sell it back to me?

1187
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:48,066
Is this a declaration of war?

1188
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:51,528
Is this some white cunt's joke 
that black cunts don't get?

1189
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:55,073
'Cause I'm not fucking laughing,
Nicolas!

1190
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,869
I know you couldn't have known 
my position,

1191
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:01,496
'cause you're not that stupid that
if you did,

1192
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:03,832
you wouldn't have turned up here
scratching your arse

1193
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,834
with that, 
"What's going on here" look

1194
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:08,336
slapped all over your Chevy Chase.

1195
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:13,758
But what you do know
is where these people live.

1196
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:23,018
If you hold back anything, 
I'll kill you.

1197
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,562
If you bend the truth,
or I think you're bending the truth,

1198
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,022
I'll kill you.

1199
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:29,191
If you forget anything,
I'll kill you.

1200
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:33,236
In fact, you're gonna have to work 
very hard to stay alive, Nick.

1201
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:36,823
Now, do you understand
everything I've said?

1202
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:40,118
Because if you don't,
I'll kill you.

1203
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:45,707
Now, Mr. Bubble and Squeak, 
you may enlighten me.

1204
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:52,797
So we've got a bit of a problem,
ain't we?

1205
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,591
Well, yeah.
Yeah, we do.

1206
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,176
Yeah, yeah, we do.

1207
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,720
In fact, it's a little bit more 
than a little bit of a problem, isn't it?

1208
01:15:58,804 --> 01:15:59,888
On a scale of things, you could say

1209
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,640
it's the Mount fucking Everest of problems.

1210
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:04,726
And the reason it's such
a mon-fucking-strosity of a problem is,

1211
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,729
you don't even got a first idea 
who did this to us, have you?

1212
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,440
Dog, we've been up all night. 
It's no one from round here.

1213
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:12,359
We've had them all lined up
against the wall.

1214
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:14,236
If he was a toe-rag from out of manor,
we'd know.

1215
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,445
We'd know.

1216
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:17,739
You'd know?
You'd fucking know?

1217
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,533
You wouldn't know if it was 
the next door fucking neighbors!

1218
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:23,745
Now get out there and find them! 
I'm sick of the fucking sight of you!

1219
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,456
Get out of my fucking sight! 
You little shit!

1220
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,344
Scarface.

1221
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:42,430
I've watched Scarface.

1222
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:46,851
If you want to know how to do a drug deal,
you watch Scarface.

1223
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,605
That really inspires confidence, that.

1224
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,232
This guy Rory Breaker...

1225
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:56,027
Rory Breaker?
Psychotic black dwarf with an Afro?

1226
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:57,654
That'll be the same man, yes.

1227
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:00,407
I heard about him.
He's a fucking lunatic.

1228
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:03,118
Well, he can afford to do the deal 
at the price we're selling.

1229
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:04,494
It's not worth him giving us any trouble,

1230
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:05,829
because he knows
we'll be a pain in the arse,

1231
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,289
and who needs a pain in the arse?

1232
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:09,457
I'll take a pain in the arse 
for half-a-million quid.

1233
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,543
You'd take a pain in the arse
for air miles.

1234
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,378
Tom, the fatter you get, 
the sadder you get.

1235
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,547
Will you two stop flirting
for a minute?

1236
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:19,384
After we pay Hatchet,
this deal puts us up

1237
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:22,387
nearly £200,000 each.

1238
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:27,559
That's not bad for a morning's work,
I think you'll agree.

1239
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:39,404
So they had the cash.

1240
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,530
And the puff.

1241
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,157
Cheeky bastards.

1242
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:43,533
Count it.

1243
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:47,537
Shit, Dog, there's a lot.
Don't you want to do it next door?

1244
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:52,834
We're not going next door 
till we've flayed them dead men walking.

1245
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,294
We'll count it upstairs.

1246
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:55,795
I don't want them to see you 
fingering their money

1247
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,464
when they walk through the door.

1248
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,090
But, Dog, look...

1249
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:03,053
Give us it here, dozy bastard.

1250
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:08,892
Check your guns.
Get yourselves well hid.

1251
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:11,227
You wait till they get right
inside the door,

1252
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:13,271
then you give it to them.

1253
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,608
Give me them shooters, 
you can use your own.

1254
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,328
Yeah?

1255
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,288
That's no way to answer the phone.

1256
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:31,790
Is that you, Dean?

1257
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:33,249
No, it's Lord fucking Lucan.

1258
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:34,334
Who do you think it is?

1259
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:35,877
What can I do for you?

1260
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,755
You know those guns I sold you?
I need them back.

1261
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:41,841
Not likely, I'm afraid.
I don't think I'll be seeing them again.

1262
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:43,718
Look, I've got the money 
to pay for them.

1263
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:46,554
I'm sure you do,
but I don't think you understand.

1264
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:49,224
I ain't gonna be seeing them 
or the guns again.

1265
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:50,433
Can't get them.

1266
01:18:50,518 --> 01:18:52,727
If we can't get them,
we can't get them.

1267
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:54,187
Well, you'll have to fucking get them.

1268
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:57,273
Look, we made the fucking deal 
for everything inside the cabinet.

1269
01:18:57,358 --> 01:19:00,485
Inside-out-fucking-side.
I don't give a shit.

1270
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,904
You get those guns,
because if you don't...

1271
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,155
Oh, yeah, Bazza, or what?

1272
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,533
Have you heard of Harry Lonsdale?

1273
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:09,953
Otherwise known as 
"Hack you up with a hatchet Harry?"

1274
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:11,996
Well, this is...

1275
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:15,291
James Bond, need-to-know time.

1276
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:19,546
When you dance with the devil, 
you wait for the song to stop.

1277
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,381
Know what I mean?

1278
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:29,556
I mean, find them,
torture them and kill them.

1279
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,808
And bring back what belongs to me.

1280
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:36,187
Because if you don't,
your family's bang in trouble.

1281
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,857
Who was that?

1282
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:41,234
That was Harry Horrible Hatchet.

1283
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:42,694
Jesus, I've heard of him.

1284
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,030
We're in shit.
They were his fucking guns we sold.

1285
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,116
We've got to find them.

1286
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,661
Now, no fucking about now, Nick. 
Where can I find those guns?

1287
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:29,616
Six black cocks and a little white kitten 
sitting on the side of the road.

1288
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:34,579
We're gonna do a proper decoration job.

1289
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:38,166
I want the gray skies of London illuminated.

1290
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:40,877
I want that house painted red.

1291
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,506
All right.

1292
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,674
There's this brass 
standing on the corner, right.

1293
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:49,344
Dwarf walks up to her carrying a suitcase.

1294
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:53,765
Winston, there, is gonna come along 
and see if he recognizes any of them.

1295
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:56,559
Now watch out for these fellows.

1296
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:59,187
They've got a bit of an arsenal,

1297
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,105
and they don't mind using it.

1298
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,483
And I'm taking down her panties.

1299
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,904
Now, does everyone here know 
what they've got to do?

1300
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:09,113
- Yeah.
- Yeah. 

1301
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:21,728
What the fuck is going on?

1302
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:08,399
You got something here for me,
have you?

1303
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,569
Come on, chop-chop.

1304
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,037
Thank you very much.

1305
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:24,499
He's got the guns.
Go ahead, you get them.

1306
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:25,750
Why me?

1307
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,502
You're supposed to be the hard case...

1308
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:30,421
You go and get the guns!
I drive the car!

1309
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:36,844
Good boy.

1310
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:38,054
Oh, get the fucking guns!

1311
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:39,722
I'm not going to get the fucking guns!

1312
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:41,057
You get the fucking guns!

1313
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:42,058
You fucking...

1314
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,690
All right, wrap them guns up.

1315
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,400
Count the money.

1316
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:52,568
Put your seat belt on.

1317
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:53,695
Fucking guns!

1318
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,614
We've got to get the fucking guns, 
or we're dead!

1319
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,548
So I made sure I fucked the one 
that was coughing.

1320
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,189
Get out of the car,
you yuppy fucker!

1321
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:01,804
He's the one we shot in the neck.

1322
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:04,056
Is that right, Mr. Botanical?

1323
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:32,210
Jesus.

1324
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:48,810
I don't believe this.
What the fuck has happened here?

1325
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,144
Jesus.

1326
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,398
The money.
The gear.

1327
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:08,287
This is fucked.

1328
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,997
No money.

1329
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,624
No weed.

1330
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,044
It's all been replaced 
by a pile of corpses.

1331
01:26:15,128 --> 01:26:17,088
All right, don't panic.

1332
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:18,506
Let's think about this.

1333
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,174
No, fuck that.

1334
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:23,594
You can think about it. 
I am panicking and I'm off.

1335
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:34,272
How did you get your hands on these then?

1336
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:35,731
The boys had them.

1337
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:37,066
I know you like these sort of things.

1338
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:39,318
Wondered if you wanted them.

1339
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:41,153
Yeah, I'll have them.

1340
01:26:41,864 --> 01:26:43,364
Was it hard work getting the money?

1341
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:45,241
Not especially.

1342
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,911
Upset a few characters though.

1343
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,163
You counted it?

1344
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:53,207
Yeah. It's all there,
to the pound.

1345
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:54,625
And they were gonna pay?

1346
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:57,003
Looks like it, but who knows?

1347
01:26:57,087 --> 01:26:58,546
The opportunity was there.

1348
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:01,716
In my experience,
it's best to take that opportunity

1349
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,301
if it's there.

1350
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:05,928
Good work, Chris.

1351
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:14,937
We've got to get those guns.

1352
01:27:15,022 --> 01:27:17,690
This is dangerous shit, Dean. 
We don't even know who lives there.

1353
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:19,525
Listen, I don't care who lives there!

1354
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:23,154
All's I know is that it's preferable 
to death by Hatchet.

1355
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,780
Fair enough.

1356
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:26,157
Let's go.

1357
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:52,183
I don't think it's the right move.

1358
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:56,562
It's either that, the old boy's place
and we lose a digit daily.

1359
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,649
I'm gonna phone him.

1360
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:00,775
As if he'll care.

1361
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:03,778
He'll care all right.
That was supposed to be his money.

1362
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:06,113
Whether he cares about us or not 
is different.

1363
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:07,865
Pass me the phone.

1364
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:24,924
Yeah?

1365
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:26,717
That you, boy?

1366
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:28,719
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.

1367
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:31,097
<i>Pay day, isn't it?</i>

1368
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,350
Yeah. I wanted to talk to you 
about that.

1369
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,268
I'll bet you do.

1370
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,479
I've got half-a-million nickers 
sitting here,

1371
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:41,023
which means some poor sod doesn't.

1372
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:43,067
<i>You've been upsetting a few people, boy.</i>

1373
01:28:44,695 --> 01:28:47,279
But that really isn't my concern,
is it?

1374
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:50,741
What does concern me
is the guns you had.

1375
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:53,703
<i>And I want to talk to you 
about that.</i>

1376
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:57,248
So get your arse over here now,
and I do mean now.

1377
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:36,203
Bastard! You fucking bastard!

1378
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,497
Fucking bastard!

1379
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:53,471
What the fuck are you doing here?

1380
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:08,069
Job well done.
We made a few quid out of that one.

1381
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:09,904
Son?

1382
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,781
Made a few quid, did you?

1383
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,075
Where's what I want?

1384
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:16,911
You all right down there, mate?

1385
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:18,370
Very fucking funny.

1386
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:20,372
Where's what I want?

1387
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:22,625
I've just left it in the office.

1388
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:24,919
We better go to the office
and get it then.

1389
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:27,421
That's if you want your son to see
his next birthday.

1390
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:29,131
Now chop-fucking-chop.

1391
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:31,092
All right, fair enough.

1392
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,512
Where are you going?

1393
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:37,932
It's a 30-second drive 
or a five-minute walk.

1394
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:40,810
And I couldn't have parked outside.

1395
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:42,144
I'd have got a ticket.

1396
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,814
I suppose that don't matter now, 
does it?

1397
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:46,982
Just be careful.

1398
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:48,192
Right.

1399
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:57,785
- You and me.
- You and who? 

1400
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,538
You know where the door handle is, Tom.

1401
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:25,354
Oh, no, not again!

1402
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:43,497
That's it. I'm off.

1403
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:48,460
Tom, that is our bag.

1404
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,814
- Ed.
- Hold on. 

1405
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,704
This is our bag.

1406
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:27,875
That's it, we're off.

1407
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:29,585
I'll see you in the car. 
I'm gonna take these guns.

1408
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:30,839
Tom, don't fuck about!

1409
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:31,921
I'll see you in the car.

1410
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:34,215
- Tom!
- It'll only take a minute. 

1411
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,357
What is going on?

1412
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:56,278
I don't know. But what I do know 
is there's no more Harry...

1413
01:32:57,364 --> 01:32:59,740
which means there's no more debt.

1414
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:03,202
And if there's no more debt, 
there's no more problem.

1415
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:07,289
And there's no problem with the neighbors,
because they're all dead.

1416
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:10,125
And I think, if I get this right...

1417
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:14,838
we haven't done anything wrong,
and we're in the clear.

1418
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:52,293
Never ever has anyone ever...

1419
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:55,629
been as fucking rude to me...

1420
01:33:56,298 --> 01:33:58,299
as you did!

1421
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,845
Fucking bastard!

1422
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:20,612
You all right, mate?

1423
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:22,948
Cheeky bastard.

1424
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:44,678
<i>Now this was an embarrassing position 
for Tom to be in.</i>

1425
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:46,555
<i>But Chris had to respect the fact</i>

1426
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,351
<i>that he was holding what appeared 
to be a pair of loaded shotguns.</i>

1427
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:53,437
<i>And Tom had to respect the fact 
that they were not loaded.</i>

1428
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:56,982
<i>So, without anybody losing too much face...</i>

1429
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:01,195
<i>Tom left through a side door,
and Chris left with the money.</i>

1430
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,364
<i>And everybody else got arrested.</i>

1431
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:09,578
He's not one of them.

1432
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:27,805
I think your dad would like 
a word with you, Ed.

1433
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:32,726
Where are the others?

1434
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:35,813
They got out yesterday. 
They're back at the bar.

1435
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:52,413
All right, Dad?

1436
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:53,789
I'm all right.

1437
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:55,249
How about yourself?

1438
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:56,625
Oh, I'm all right.

1439
01:35:58,128 --> 01:35:59,837
Could do with a drink, though.

1440
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:02,339
All in good time,
all in good time.

1441
01:36:03,133 --> 01:36:05,509
So you in the clear?

1442
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:08,345
More importantly, am I?

1443
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,515
It appears so.

1444
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:13,559
Appears?

1445
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:17,521
You'll have to do better 
than fucking appears, my friend.

1446
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:22,025
Well, everybody's dead, Dad. 
I think that's about as clear as you can get.

1447
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,319
How about that drink?

1448
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,029
You know where the bar is.

1449
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,197
Hey?

1450
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:31,869
Don't make yourself too comfortable.
Alan's got to sit there.

1451
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:33,036
Alan!

1452
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:40,377
You're lucky you're still breathing, 
let alone able to walk.

1453
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:44,256
I suggest you take full advantage of that fact.

1454
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:11,492
You took your time.

1455
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:13,160
Where the hell have you been?

1456
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:15,204
Sit down, I'll tell you.

1457
01:37:20,877 --> 01:37:24,671
So the traffic warden identified 
the neighbors' bodies,

1458
01:37:25,632 --> 01:37:28,133
which sort of puts us in the clear.

1459
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:33,222
The only thing connecting us with the case 
is those shotguns.

1460
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:35,557
And Tom took care of them.

1461
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:40,103
You did take care of the shotguns,
didn't you, Tom?

1462
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:43,524
I wanted to talk to you about that.

1463
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:44,775
Well, talk.

1464
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,529
Well, actually, no.

1465
01:37:50,573 --> 01:37:51,615
I've got them sitting in the car.

1466
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:53,325
I was gonna sell them back 
to Nick the Greek,

1467
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,452
but I'm having a bit of trouble 
getting hold of him.

1468
01:37:55,537 --> 01:37:57,120
You dippy bastard.

1469
01:37:57,205 --> 01:37:58,247
So...

1470
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:03,085
the only thing connecting us with the case

1471
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:06,421
is in the back of your car, 
which is parked outside?

1472
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:10,425
They cost us 700 quid.
I'm not gonna throw them away.

1473
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:14,179
And they're hardly likely to trace them
back to us, are they?

1474
01:38:14,264 --> 01:38:17,349
Do you really think it's worth 
taking the risk for £700?

1475
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:19,184
Tom, you're a dick.

1476
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:23,105
Now you take those guns,
and you throw them off a bridge.

1477
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:25,232
And throw yourself off
while you're at it.

1478
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:27,317
Now, Tom.

1479
01:38:31,573 --> 01:38:33,657
- Look, all I'm...
- Now, Tom! 

1480
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:43,083
Can I have a beer, please, Dad?

1481
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:45,168
I'm busy.
Get it yourself.

1482
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:04,938
It seemed Hatchet underestimated you lot...

1483
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:07,232
and it seems to have cost him.

1484
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:11,361
Well, I ain't gonna make 
the same mistake now, am I?

1485
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:14,323
So I've decided to bring your bag back.

1486
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,703
I think the word you're looking for, 
gentlemen, is "thank you."

1487
01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:21,997
Thank you.

1488
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:25,959
Now you've presented me with a problem.

1489
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:28,295
I've lost my employer.

1490
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:33,383
So I've taken care of meself and me son.

1491
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:36,303
Now if you think that's unfair,

1492
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:38,764
you come and pay me a little visit.

1493
01:39:38,848 --> 01:39:40,807
But you better be waving a white flag

1494
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:43,560
high and clear,
so as I can see it.

1495
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:48,190
Or it'll be the last little visit
you ever make.

1496
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,400
You understand?

1497
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:54,529
That's all I've come to say.

1498
01:39:56,658 --> 01:39:58,617
There is one more thing.

1499
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:02,829
It's been emotional.

1500
01:40:30,817 --> 01:40:33,568
We are now officially
in the money-lending business.

1501
01:40:33,653 --> 01:40:35,153
You all right, Son?

1502
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:37,489
Put your seat belt on.

1503
01:40:37,824 --> 01:40:39,449
We're out of here.

1504
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:49,543
It's empty.

1505
01:42:00,615 --> 01:42:03,200
What's his number?

1506
01:42:09,165 --> 01:42:12,250
Don't, don't! You'll jam the line!
I'll call him.

1507
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:20,967
My fucking battery.

1508
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:22,594
- Oh, you...
- Give me the phone!

1509
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,304
- No, fuck off! I'll dial it!
- Give me the phone!

1510
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:27,641
Just be calm for a minute. All right, 
shut up and tell me the number!

1511
01:42:37,527 --> 01:42:38,777
Fuck you!
Give me your phone!

1512
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:41,530
- You'll break it! Just calm down!
- Give me the phone!

1513
01:42:45,785 --> 01:42:48,078
Look, you'll break it, 
and it'll be fucked, won't it?

1514
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:50,747
Will you shut?
It's fucking ringing!
