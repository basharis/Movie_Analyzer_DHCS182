We be the infamous
You heard of us, official
Queensbridge murderers

The Mobb comes equipped
for warfare

9
00:01:22,435 --> 00:01:25,020
Beware of my crime family
who got enough shots to share

10
00:01:25,103 --> 00:01:28,355
For all those
who want to profile and pose

11

Rock you in your face
Stab your brain with your nosebone

12
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:32,901
You all alone
in these streets, cousin

13
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:35,694
Every man for theyself
in this land we be gunnin'

14
00:01:35,777 --> 00:01:38,446
And keep them shook crews
runnin'like they suppose to

15
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:41,197
They come around
but they never come close to

16
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:44,241
I can see it inside your face
You're in the wrong place

17
00:01:44,283 --> 00:01:48,286
Cowards like you just get
their whole body laced up
with bullet holes and such

18
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,537
Speak the wrong words, man
and you will get touched

19
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,623
You can put your whole army
against my team

20
00:01:53,706 --> 00:01:56,541
I guarantee it'll be your
very last time breathin'

21
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,752
Your simple words
just don't move me
You're minor, we're major

22
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:01,920
You're all up in the game
and don't deserve to be a player

23
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:04,923
Don't make me have
to call your name out
Your crew's featherweight

24
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:06,924
My gunshots will
make you levitate

25
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:09,008
I'm only 19
but my mind is old

26
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,343
When the things get for real
my warm heart turns cold

27
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:13,929

I couldn't choose
a better location

33
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:29,397
When the slugs penetrate
you feel a burning sensation

34
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,941
Getting closer to God
in a tight situation

35
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:34,400
Now, take these words home
and think it through

36
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:37,027
Or the next rhyme I write
might be about you

37
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,780

Livin'the life
that of diamonds and guns

42
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:52,454
There's numerous ways you
can choose to earn funds

43
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:55,248
Some get shot, locked down
and turn nuns

44

Going backstage.
I'm in the battle.
You can't go backstage.

You a crazy motherfucker,
you know that, trying to
fight bouncers and shit.

63

The fuckin' guy's obviously
got somethin' against me.

Yeah, Hip-Hop Shop.
Leadaz ofTha Free World.
A'ight, dawg.

492
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:09,318
Hey, Hip-Hop Shop,
Wednesday night.

493
00:32:09,402 --> 00:32:11,444
Come on down.
Come on down.

494
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:17,949
Hey, girl, uh, it's gonna be
your only opportunity to blow
the both of us, baby.

495
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:23,703
'Cause after we go platinum,
you won't be able to get
to me and Future.

496
00:32:23,786 --> 00:32:26,122
And, uh, why do
they call you Future?

497
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:29,291
See, I had a lot of names,
you know, the most conceited kind.

498
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:34,627
I was, uh, Maximum Brimstone,
Godfather "D" Devastatin' "D"

499
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:37,629
Big "D"...you know,
that has a double meaning to it.

500
00:32:37,671 --> 00:32:40,172
But see, none of those
really worked for me...

501
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:42,465
till I started hosting those battles
down at The Shelter.

502
00:32:44,342 --> 00:32:46,760
One day, somebody said,
"You know what, man?

503
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:49,178
You are the future
of hip-hop in Detroit."

504
00:32:49,262 --> 00:32:53,974
So you see, baby,
sometimes you got to find
your name and, uh,

505
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,101
other times,
your name finds you.

506
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,812
You want to
smoke some ganja?

507
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:04,106
See, that's our problem.
If we don't respect
our sisters, who will?

508
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:07,317
Yo, we're doin' it
to ourselves.

509
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:10,360
He's my brother.
He don't like pussy.

510
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:14,446
Yo, Rabbit.
Teach me to write rhymes.

511
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:17,948
That's the way
to get the ladies, right?

512
00:33:18,032 --> 00:33:19,992
Let me out.

513
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:22,327
Yo, yo, hold up.
Look, I'm sorry.

514
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:26,163
I didn't know Papa and L.C.
Were on their bullshit until tonight.

515
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,497
Look, man, you know I wouldn't
be messin' with them...

516
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:32,083

them at the Hip-Hop Shop next week.

I'm talkin' about, Jimmy?

519

Look, man, they're
just one of the acts.

520
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,136
Hey, Jimmy, if you want,
I'll step out, man.
You're my friend.

521
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:50,387
I don't want you
bein' mad at me.
Man, do what you want to do.

Hey, don't you
ever shut up, man?

526
00:34:06,315 --> 00:34:08,900
Why you got to push me?
Damn, Future.

527
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:12,027
Man, what the hell
is his problem?

528
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,070

1310
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:56,013
Climbin' up this mountain
You're weak, I leave you

01:47:23,103 --> 01:47:26,813
He's no father, he goes
home and barely knows
his own daughter

1587
01:47:26,896 --> 01:47:29,565
But hold your nose 'cause
here goes the cold water

1588
01:47:29,648 --> 01:47:32,526
His ho's don't want him
no mo' he's cold product

1589
01:47:32,568 --> 01:47:34,735
And they moved on
to the next schmo who flows

1590
01:47:34,819 --> 01:47:38,071
He nose-dove and sold nada
And so the soap opera

1591
01:47:38,155 --> 01:47:40,739
Is told, it unfolds
I suppose it's old, partner

1592
01:47:40,823 --> 01:47:44,033
But the beat goes on
Dah-da-dum, da-dum da-dah

1593
01:47:44,117 --> 01:47:48,536
Lose yourself in the music
The moment you want it
You better never let it go

1594
01:47:48,619 --> 01:47:51,788
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow

1595
01:47:51,872 --> 01:47:54,207
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime

1596
01:47:54,291 --> 01:48:00,128
Lose yourself in the music
The moment you want it
You better never let it go

1597
01:48:00,211 --> 01:48:03,046
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow

1598
01:48:03,088 --> 01:48:05,548
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime

1599
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:07,549
Give it up
No more games
I'm gonna change

1600
01:48:07,591 --> 01:48:10,177
What you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin'roof off

1601
01:48:10,218 --> 01:48:13,095
Like two dogs caged
I was playin'in the beginning

1602
01:48:13,179 --> 01:48:16,972
The mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out
and booed off stage

1603
01:48:17,055 --> 01:48:20,016
But I kept rhymin'
and stepped right in the next cypher

1604
01:48:20,099 --> 01:48:22,893
Best believe somebody's
payin'the pied piper

1605
01:48:22,976 --> 01:48:25,896
All the pain inside
amplified by the

1606
01:48:25,936 --> 01:48:28,522
Fact that I can't get by
with my nine-to-

1607
01:48:28,606 --> 01:48:31,316
Five and I can't provide
the right type of

1608
01:48:31,399 --> 01:48:34,693
Life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn
food stamps

1609
01:48:34,735 --> 01:48:38,362
Don't buy diapers
And it's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer

1610
01:48:38,404 --> 01:48:40,864
This is my life
and these times are so hard

1611
01:48:40,906 --> 01:48:44,200
And it's gettin'even harder
Tryin'to feed and water
my seed plus

1612
01:48:44,241 --> 01:48:47,951
Teeter-totter caught up
between bein'a father
and a prima donna

1613
01:48:48,035 --> 01:48:52,038
Baby momma drama screamin'
on her too much for me
to wanna stay in one spot

1614
01:48:52,121 --> 01:48:55,624
Another day of monotony's
gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail

1615
01:48:55,707 --> 01:48:58,959
I've got to formulate a plot
or end up in jail or shot

1616
01:48:59,043 --> 01:49:02,378
Success is my only
motherfuckin'option
Failure's not

1617
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:05,005
Mom, I love you but
this trailer's got to go

1618
01:49:05,088 --> 01:49:08,883
I cannot grow old
in Salem's Lot, so here I go
It's my shot

1619
01:49:08,925 --> 01:49:12,844
Feet fail me not
This may be the only
opportunity that I got

1620
01:49:12,928 --> 01:49:16,346
You better
Lose yourself in the music
The moment you want it

1621
01:49:16,429 --> 01:49:19,556
You better never let it go
You only get one shot

1622
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:23,976
Do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes
once in a lifetime

1623
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:27,562
Give it up
Lose yourself in the music
The moment you want it

1624
01:49:27,646 --> 01:49:30,731
You better never let it go
You only get one shot

1625
01:49:30,815 --> 01:49:35,150
Do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity
comes once in a lifetime

1626
01:49:35,234 --> 01:49:37,694
Move it up

1627
01:49:37,778 --> 01:49:40,696
You can do anything
you set your mind to, man.
