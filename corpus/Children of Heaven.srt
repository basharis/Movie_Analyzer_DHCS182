That'll be 30 Toumans. Thank you.

Here is your change.

12
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,315
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Good-bye.

<i>Salt, salt for trade!</i>

14
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,302
Hello, Akbar Aqa.
I need some potatoes.

15
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,816
<i>Not those, kid.</i>
<i>Pick some down there.</i>

16
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,502
Hello. How are you?

17
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,504
With your permission.

18
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,825
Good-bye.

19
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,472
- Sixty-five Toumans.
- My mom said to put it on our tab.

20
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,911
Tell her your account
has reached its limit.

21
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,472
She should come and pay
at least part of it.

22
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,541
All right.

23
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,737
What the hell are you doing?

24
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,945
Why did you spill these?
Are you crazy?

25
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,750
- My sister's shoes disappeared.
- Get lost. Beat it.

26
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,623
- I left my sister's shoes here.
- I said get lost.

27
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,461
What? You're still here?

28
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,919
<i>You don't pay rent.</i>

29
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:59,219
<i>With all the water you use,</i>
<i>the yard will collapse!</i>

30
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,385
<i>What can I do?</i>
<i>The laundry is dirty!</i>

31
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,827
<i>I don't give a damn</i>
<i>if the laundry is dirty!</i>

32
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,921
<i>Don't you ever do your wash?</i>

33
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,932
<i>Why don't you wash</i>
<i>all the neighbors' carpets...</i>

34
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,798
<i>while you're at it?</i>

35
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:16,199
<i>But don't you ever</i>
<i>wash your clothes?</i>

36
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,369
You damn people
are going to ruin me!

37
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,936
You haven't paid rent in five months.

38
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,073
Why do you pour so much water?

39
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,311
Don't you ever wash your clothes
during the year?

40
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,354
<i>This is the last time,</i>
<i>I'm warning you!</i>

41
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:33,188
<i>Why don't you come here when</i>
<i>there are men to put you in your place?</i>

42
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,263
<i>Ali.</i>

43
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,858
Tell Zahra to peel the potatoes
after she puts the baby to sleep.

44
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,582
Ali, did you get my shoes?

45
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:09,150
Mom said to peel the potatoes
if the baby is asleep.

46
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,594
- I said, did you get my shoes?
<i>- Yes.</i>

47
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,928
- Has he repaired them nicely?
<i>- Yes.</i>

48
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,701
- Where are you going?
- I want to see what they look like.

49
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,069
Your shoes are not there.

50
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,446
<i>- Are you teasing me?</i>
- No, I swear I'm telling the truth.

51
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,486
I went to the store,
and the shoes disappeared.

52
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:41,323
I looked all over,
but I couldn't find them.

53
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,726
<i>You mean they're lost?</i>

54
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,924
Don't say anything to Mom.
I'll find them.

55
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,625
How will I get
to school tomorrow?

56
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:55,265
<i>Don't cry. I'll go after them</i>
<i>right away. I'll find them.</i>

57
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,502
<i>But you said you looked all over.</i>

58
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,511
Not all over.

59
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,447
Please, don't tell Mom anything.

60
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,692
Ali! Ali,
where are you going?

61
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,734
Help me fold the rug.
Where are you going?

62
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,179
Ali, we play against
Shahin tomorrow.

63
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,188
Where are you going?

64
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,431
What are you doing here again?

65
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,705
Didn't I tell you to stay away?
What a pain in the neck!

66
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,446
- Hello, Aqa Sayed.
- Hello, son. How are you?

67
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,455
- Are you going home?
- Yes.

68
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,787
Wait a minute.
I need a favor.

69
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,732
This is sugar
for next week's ceremony.

70
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,135
- Ask your dad to chop it.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,139
Stay well, son.

72
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,841
You have nothing to do
with the landlord.

73
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,903
It's my job to deal with him.

74
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,074
<i>Why do you argue with him?</i>

75
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,949
<i>I'll teach him a lesson.</i>
<i>I'll break his neck.</i>

76
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,854
I'll make him understand
where his place is.

77
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,792
Tell me why
you don't listen to me!

78
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,295
Didn't the doctor say
you shouldn't do work?

79
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,993
<i>Don't get mad!</i>
<i>Why did you do all this wash?</i>

80
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,230
<i>That rug is heavy</i>
<i>when it's wet!</i>

81
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,465
You! Why didn't you help
your mother...

82
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,939
<i>when she asked you to?</i>

83
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,943
<i>You should have been patient.</i>

84
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:49,380
I would have come home
and taken care of it.

85
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,882
What is your duty
in this house?

86
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,011
<i>Eat, sleep and play?</i>

87
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,555
<i>You're not a kid anymore.</i>
<i>You're nine years old.</i>

88
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,922
<i>When I was nine years old,</i>
<i>I helped my parents.</i>

89
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,928
Why do you make me mad?

90
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,625
Are you stupid? Are you dumb?
Don't you understand?

91
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,137
<i>All right. Don't stress yourself.</i>

92
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,500
They make me so mad.

93
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,878
<i>I don't know why the baby</i>
<i>has been feeling bad all day.</i>

94
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:59,280
Zahra, pour some tea
for your father.

95
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,107
Thank you, dear.

96
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:27,373
I serve tea all day long
at the company,

97
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:31,280
but Zahra's tea
has a special taste.

98
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,944
Zahra, dear,
you didn't bring the sugar bowl.

99
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,146
There is all this sugar.

100
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,452
This belongs to the mosque.

101
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,425
It's been given us in trust.

102
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,258
Get some sugar candy from the pot.

103
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,389
Are we out of sugar?

104
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,695
I've been taking the coupons
to the grocer,

105
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,430
but the sugar hasn't arrived yet.

106
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,438
Forget about him.

107
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,565
He doesn't pay attention
to the news.

108
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,734
He distributes it
when he decides.

109
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,744
You'd better give
the coupons to me.

110
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,009
<i>- I'll get the sugar</i>
<i>from the company store.</i>
- They're under the rug.

111
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,557
<i>What's wrong, darling?</i>

112
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,563
Ali...

113
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,070
how am I going...

114
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,071
to school...

115
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,132
without shoes...

116
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,911
tomorrow?

117
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:44,285
<i>Go to your company store tomorrow.</i>

118
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:48,224
<i>We don't have any formula left.</i>
<i>Buy some for the baby.</i>

119
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,025
<i>Don't worry.</i>

120
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,960
<i>Rahim Aqa's wife</i>
<i>had a slipped disc.</i>

121
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,402
<i>Surgery made it worse.</i>

122
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,531
You should learn to live with it.

123
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:06,942
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>
<i>Do nothing all day?</i>

124
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,072
<i>Well, the doctor</i>
<i>has forbidden work.</i>

125
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:16,244
You can go to school with slippers.

126
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:24,053
<i>Kokab Khanom's sister</i>
<i>had surgery, and she's fine.</i>

127
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:29,458
<i>Don't even think about surgery.</i>

128
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:34,063
<i>I don't want you</i>
<i>to become crippled.</i>

129
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,974
Ali, you really have some nerve.

130
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:43,743
<i>You lost my shoes.</i>

131
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:48,776
<i>I'm going to tell Dad.</i>

132
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,635
Zahra, if you tell Dad,
he'll beat both of us...

133
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:09,299
because he doesn't have money
to buy you a pair of shoes.

134
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,341
Then what should I do?

135
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:23,043
You can wear my sneakers.

136
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,293
I'll wear them...

137
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:33,255
when you're back from school.

138
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,847
This is for you.

139
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,504
<i>Salt, salt, trade for dry bread.</i>

140
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,978
Salt trade for plastic bags,
for old slippers!

141
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,147
<i>Next.</i>

142
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,584
<i>You, Niloofar. You, Fereshteh.</i>

143
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,440
Are you all right? Stay here.

144
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,313
Listen, kids.

145
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:07,683
Fereshteh couldn't jump well
because of her shoes.

146
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,381
<i>One of the most</i>
<i>important things...</i>

147
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,323
is sneakers.

148
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:17,886
And I see, unfortunately,
that some of you don't wear them,

149
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,625
but some of you
are wearing them.

150
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,224
<i>Okay, Bahareh, it's your turn.</i>

151
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,194
<i>Next.</i>

152
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,089
Come on!

153
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,329
Hurry up!

154
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,705
- Why are you late?
- I'm not late. I ran all the way.

155
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,711
Take the sneakers off. I'm late.

156
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,857
Did you get to school on time?

157
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,597
I was late.
You have to come earlier.

158
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,469
I came right after the class.

159
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,941
- You didn't tell Mom, did you?
- When I say I won't tell, I won't.

160
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,241
<i>The sneakers are very dirty.</i>

161
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,979
- I'm ashamed to wear them.
- You're making excuses again.

162
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,681
<i>No, it's true.</i>
<i>They are very dirty.</i>

163
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,690
Well, we'll wash them.

164
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,755
- Ali, let's go to practice.
- I'm busy.

165
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,758
- Come on.
- I can't come.

166
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,260
- It won't take long.
- My mother is ill.

167
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,262
Get lost.

168
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:09,082
- Today my dear girl
did all the housework...

169
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,089
and Ali helped her.

170
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,091
I bought bread and vegetables.

171
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,529
I swept the floor, washed
the vegetables and peeled potatoes.

172
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,532
<i>Good girl.</i>

173
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,435
<i>I'll buy something nice for</i>
<i>both of them when I get a raise.</i>

174
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,107
<i>You look much better now...</i>

175
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:44,212
<i>after a couple of days rest.</i>

176
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,651
<i>If you don't use the stairs,</i>
<i>soon you'll be all right.</i>

177
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,416
- What is it?
- Ali, it's raining.

178
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:18,422
The sneakers are getting wet.
I'm afraid to go outside.

179
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,244
Excuse me, ma'am.
What time is it?

180
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,682
There is still time
left to write. Go on.

181
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,100
Excuse me, ma'am. May I leave?

182
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:57,137
So you were just
in a hurry to leave?

183
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,385
Go.

184
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,869
What is it, little girl?
What happened, my dear?

185
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,074
My shoe fell in the water.
It's stuck under the bridge.

186
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:41,414
All right. Don't cry, dear.
I'll get it for you.

187
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,007
Run and catch it.

188
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,347
Catch that shoe, old man. Catch it.

189
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,165
Where were you?

190
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,501
Why are you late?

191
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,876
- Why is it wet?
- I won't wear these anymore.

192
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,280
- Why it is wet?
- It fell in the gutter.

193
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,285
<i>How do I go to school</i>
<i>in a wet sneaker?</i>

194
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:52,153
- They're big. They come off.
- That's a good one!

195
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,555
It's your fault.
You lost my shoes.

196
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,560
Find them or I'll tell Dad.

197
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,358
I'm not scared of getting a beating!

198
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,762
Dad has no money
until the end of the month,

199
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,427
so he has to borrow some.

200
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,519
I thought you understood that.

201
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,277
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

202
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,313
<i>Come down here.</i>

203
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,043
Where have you been?
Why are you so late?

204
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,384
Please, sir, I live far from here.

205
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,583
Or do you play on the way?

206
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:04,059
<i>You were late yesterday as well.</i>

207
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,961
Next time, I won't let you in.

208
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,726
Yes, sir.

209
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,663
Why are your shoes wet?

210
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,734
Please, sir, I fell in the gutter.

211
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,243
Why aren't your pants wet?

212
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:23,439
Please, sir, it was shallow.

213
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,415
Is that so?

214
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,890
Why aren't your socks wet?

215
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,665
Don't let it happen again.

216
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,133
<i>- Go to your class.</i>
- Yes, sir.

217
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,477
- Permission, sir?
<i>- Sit down.</i>

218
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,074
"We are playing against Shahin today."

219
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,323
"I can't come. My mom is ill."

220
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,171
It's the final match.

221
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,273
What's going on?

222
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,041
<i>Can't you keep quiet</i>
<i>until I'm finished?</i>

223
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,581
Sit up straight.

224
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,713
<i>Sit down. Sit down!</i>

225
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,024
Those who were laughing
will now cry.

226
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,895
Everybody failed,
except for 15 students.

227
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:24,492
However, three earned top grades.

228
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,231
Karim Nanva.

229
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,900
<i>Ali Mandegar. Salman Najafi.</i>

230
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:39,214
I want to talk to them after class.

231
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,506
<i>Zahra, Zahra.</i>

232
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,648
Why don't you wait
when I call you?

233
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,244
Where are you going?

234
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:21,314
I'm returning Kobra Khanom's
bowl of offering stew.

235
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,587
Are you mad at me?

236
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,872
- Isn't it nice?
- Where did you get it?

237
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,105
It's a prize from my teacher.
It's for you.

238
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,275
Take it.

239
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,009
- Really, for me?
<i>- Yes.</i>

240
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,351
I didn't tell Mom, you know?

241
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,949
- I knew you wouldn't.
- I'll be back soon.

242
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:17,172
Ali, dear, bring me that tray.

243
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,917
Take the bowl of soup
to Kokab Khanom.

244
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,442
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- It's me, Ali.

245
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,344
- I have some soup for Kokab Khanom.
<i>- Come in, son.</i>

246
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,678
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hello, Ali, dear.

247
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,776
Thank you very much.

248
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,447
- How is your dad, son?
- He is fine. Thank you.

249
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,497
Ali, dear, it's very nice
of your mother.

250
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,797
- Don't mention it.
- How is your mom?

251
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,633
She is fine. Not bad.

252
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,673
- Give her my regards.
- Yes, ma'am.

253
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:20,575
Ali, don't go now.
Wait a minute. It's not much.

254
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,904
- Here, take this.
- No, thank you.

255
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,822
Take it, son. God bless you.

256
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,789
Give my regards to your dad.

257
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,515
<i>Arms up!</i>

258
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,763
I am the flower of this country!

259
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,388
<i>Attention.</i>

260
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,359
Obedient to the leader.

261
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:50,032
Exams are coming up.
I have some suggestions for you.

262
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:53,599
Look, children,
during the exam period,

263
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,340
<i>you want to see the result</i>
<i>of your labor.</i>

264
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:01,818
<i>So you should work harder.</i>
<i>You must organize your time.</i>

265
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,447
<i>I will talk to your parents</i>
<i>to make sure...</i>

266
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:09,425
<i>you can study</i>
<i>without problems at home.</i>

267
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,826
<i>You should not stay up late...</i>

268
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,025
<i>to watch TV series.</i>

269
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,934
<i>Set a limited time for a break</i>
<i>to watch the cartoons,</i>

270
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,336
<i>then all you do is study.</i>

271
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,207
<i>Ask your mothers to go over</i>
<i>the lessons with you...</i>

272
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,177
<i>to make sure you</i>
<i>understand them well.</i>

273
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,919
<i>I told you that you must</i>
<i>clip your fingernails regularly.</i>

274
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:44,223
<i>You have to clip them every Friday</i>
<i>when you have time...</i>

275
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:49,392
<i>so that on Saturday they're clean.</i>

276
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,335
<i>Why? Because bacteria...</i>

277
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:57,738
<i>collects under the nails...</i>

278
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,742
<i>and when you eat...</i>

279
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,712
<i>with your hands, you get sick.</i>

280
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,749
<i>All right, you may go to your classes.</i>

281
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,527
<i>In order, my dear.</i>
<i>Go in order, my girl.</i>

282
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,430
<i>First grade, second, third,</i>
<i>fourth and fifth.</i>

283
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,986
<i>The ducks...</i>

284
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,429
started to fly...

285
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,861
and carried the turtle with them.

286
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,940
Hold your sheets up,
hold your sheets up.

287
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,950
Hurry up, my dear.

288
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,952
<i>Farrokhi, you collect</i>
<i>the papers on this side.</i>

289
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,478
<i>Keep your minds focused.</i>
<i>Use the break period properly.</i>

290
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,583
<i>Remember, the next class</i>
<i>is mathematics.</i>

291
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,421
- Hi!
- Hello!

292
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,612
Why are you late this time?

293
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,283
You can't use
the wet-shoe excuse now.

294
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,624
Come down here. Come on.

295
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,473
Come on, get going. Come on.

296
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:05,379
I'm talking to you. Go home
and come back with your father.

297
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,441
Please, sir, my father is at work.

298
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,851
Tell him to come tomorrow.
Get going.

299
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,856
Please, sir, he goes to work
tomorrow too.

300
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,763
- So come back with your mother.
- Please, sir, my mother is ill.

301
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:24,062
<i>I won't accept any excuses.</i>
<i>This is how we treat</i>
<i>an irresponsible student.</i>

302
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:27,069
Out you go. Get out.

303
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,380
What happened, Ali?
What is it?

304
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,394
Stay here.

305
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:56,298
Good morning.

306
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:11,145
He's a good student, very orderly.

307
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,274
Mandegar, come here.

308
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:22,048
This time I'll excuse you
for Mr. Jafari's sake.

309
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,424
Don't let it happen again.

310
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:28,090
Go to your class. Go!

311
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,365
- That was very kind of you.
- You're welcome.

312
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:52,188
There it is.
That's their house.

313
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,255
Roya?

314
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,025
Roya?

315
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,232
You little devil.
Playing games again?

316
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:14,076
<i>Where are you, my love?</i>

317
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,977
Little devil!

318
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:21,746
You naughty girl!

319
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,359
<i>Do you need anything?</i>

320
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,988
<i>Roya! After you buy the bread,</i>
<i>come right back.</i>

321
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,933
Come and serve the tea.

322
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,403
Yes, let's go, Mustafa.

323
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,194
Are you sure you don't need these?

324
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:14,721
No. Don't worry.

325
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,130
<i>- May Fatima Zahra reward you.</i>
- Thank you.

326
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,937
Are you sure
you can do the job?

327
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,533
<i>Spraying a couple of trees...</i>

328
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,545
and plowing the garden
is no big deal!

329
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:34,312
Besides, it costs nothing.
I got the equipment from Hosein.

330
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:37,319
Sometimes he takes off from work...

331
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:41,187
and goes all the way uptown.

332
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:46,286
Since he's been doing this,
he's even saved a little.

333
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:50,094
Tomorrow is Friday, so Ali and I
will go uptown and go around.

334
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:56,172
It's fun, and we might
make some money.

335
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,748
Let's go.

336
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,725
I'll ring the bells on this side,
and you take the other.

337
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:08,532
- What should I say?
- Ask them if they need a gardener.

338
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,937
Listen to me and learn.
You do the same. Come here.

339
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,564
- Hello!
- It's me.

340
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:37,225
- Who is it?
- Karim, ma'am.

341
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,064
<i>Karim? Who are you looking for?</i>

342
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:43,106
- No one, ma'am.
- Who are you?

343
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:49,112
- I mean... We...
- Why do you bother people?

344
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,910
- Wait a minute!
- Parviz, go see who's bothering us!

345
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:56,419
- Run, Ali!
- Who is it?

346
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,886
Stay right there,
if you're a man!

347
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,199
Get off, Ali.

348
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:17,940
What strange people!
What did I say wrong?

349
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,415
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- Good morning.

350
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,959
<i>- May I help you?</i>
- Yes, thanks.

351
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:40,087
<i>- Who are you?</i>
- My name is Karim.

352
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,222
<i>Karim? Who are you looking for?</i>

353
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:47,268
- I-I...
- We are gardeners, sir.

354
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:51,000
<i>We spray the trees,</i>
<i>plow the garden...</i>

355
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:54,134
prune the branches.

356
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:57,009
<i>We don't need your services.</i>

357
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:01,945
Bravo. You know a lot.

358
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,744
Let's go.

359
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:19,433
<i>- Do you need a gardener?</i>
<i>- No, we don't need one.</i>

360
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,922
<i>- Yes?</i>
<i>- Do you need a gardener?</i>

361
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,016
<i>- No, thank you.</i>

362
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,961
<i>Run, Ali, run.</i>

363
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,028
<i>- Dad, do you want some water?</i>
- No, son.

364
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:00,695
<i>Who is it? Who is it?</i>

365
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:05,033
<i>Hey, boy, why don't you answer?</i>

366
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:11,611
<i>- Are you gone?</i>
- I'm here.

367
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,615
Ask your dad
if you need any gardening.

368
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,844
<i>- My dad isn't home.</i>
- Ask your mom.

369
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:19,411
<i>She's not home either.</i>
<i>It's only my grandpa and me.</i>

370
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,821
Ask your grandpa
if you need a gardener.

371
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,951
- Are you a gardener?
<i>- Not me, my dad.</i>

372
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:28,225
- Where is your dad?
<i>- Right here, in the street.</i>

373
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:32,200
<i>- Now will you ask your grandpa?</i>
- Tell me your name first.

374
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,203
My name is Ali.

375
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,035
And my name is Alireza.

376
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,008
- What grade are you in?
- I'm in third grade.

377
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,237
Now will you get your grandpa?

378
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,405
My grandpa is asleep.

379
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,847
<i>Why didn't you say so</i>
<i>in the first place?</i>

380
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,850
Ali, let's go.

381
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,751
Ali, do you want to come in
and play with me?

382
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,289
I have to go. Bye.

383
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:57,520
Ali, wait!

384
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:28,481
<i>I have some fertilizer</i>
<i>you can use.</i>

385
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:32,551
<i>After that,</i>
<i>you can spray the trees.</i>

386
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:34,824
Especially the cherry
and apricot trees.

387
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:37,492
I planted them myself.
I spray them every year.

388
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,429
One year I didn't spray them...

389
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,564
and two of them died.

390
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:49,169
- Okay.
<i>- Ali, let's go play.</i>

391
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:51,713
Come on. Let's go.

392
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:54,579
<i>Go on, son.</i>
<i>I'll stay with your father.</i>

393
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,552
Go, dear.

394
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,422
Thank you very much.
Here you go.

395
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,924
- Money is not important.
- Please.

396
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:15,361
- It is too much.
<i>- It is not worthy of you.</i>

397
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:20,028
- Thank you.
<i>- You did all the work. I thank you.</i>

398
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,037
<i>Let's go.</i>

399
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:32,175
<i>When I come back here,</i>
<i>I'll call to see...</i>

400
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:34,739
<i>if you have work for me.</i>

401
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:42,249
<i>- Good-bye.</i>
<i>- Good-bye.</i>

402
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:51,196
I could take a month of vacation,
and in the afternoons,

403
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:55,567
instead of working overtime,
I could work in this neighborhood.

404
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,539
We're gonna have a better life.

405
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,542
We're gonna buy everything.

406
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:04,569
I'll buy a motorcycle,
I'll buy a dresser,

407
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,911
an iron for your mother,

408
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,974
a big refrigerator.

409
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:14,513
We may even rent a larger house.

410
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:17,617
- I'll buy everything!
- Buy a pair of shoes for Zahra.

411
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:20,754
That's nothing.
I'll buy a pair for you too.

412
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:25,164
- Buy a pair for Zahra first.
Hers are torn.
<i>- All right.</i>

413
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,053
Ali, hold on tight!

414
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:54,028
- Dad, please stop!
- The brakes are gone. Hold tight!

415
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,122
Dad, stop!

416
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,433
Hold on tight!

417
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:03,234
Dad, please stop!

418
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,241
Hold on! Shit!

419
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,540
<i>The landlord came by again</i>
<i>for the rent.</i>

420
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:17,704
What an insolent man!

421
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,079
I went to see him
a couple of days ago.

422
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:26,053
I told him I'd pay him soon.

423
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,056
That man doesn't see reason.

424
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:31,423
<i>He waited for you for two,</i>
<i>three hours in the yard.</i>

425
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:35,021
The idiot!
I'll go see him tomorrow.

426
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:38,329
<i>- You can't go empty-handed.</i>
- Trust in God.

427
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:42,701
- Don't worry.
<i>- Can you go in this condition?</i>

428
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,740
Nothing's wrong with me.

429
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:17,770
Hey, girl! Wait! Your pen!

430
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:02,046
Attention, students.
I'm talking to you boys.

431
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:07,351
There is a series of long-distance
races for kids of all ages...

432
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:10,290
being organized in this province.

433
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,262
<i>The first round has been planned</i>
<i>for third and fourth graders.</i>

434
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:20,291
<i>Those interested in the race</i>
<i>should come and register...</i>

435
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,668
for a preliminary selection.

436
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,230
The runners will be timed.

437
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,953
Here, your pen.

438
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:21,861
You dropped it yesterday.

439
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:52,884
Aga Davood,
see what this good man needs.

440
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:55,294
- Hello.
- Good morning.

441
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:58,595
- I hope you are well.
- Thank you. How can I help you?

442
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:02,001
I need a pair of girl's shoes
for a good price.

443
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:05,438
- What size?
- I don't know the size,

444
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,442
but she's in first grade.

445
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,070
First grade.

446
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:20,022
Here you are. Two models.
Which do you want?

447
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:22,023
<i>What color are they?</i>

448
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,525
<i>One pair is red with red trimming.</i>

449
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:28,030
<i>The other pair is violet</i>
<i>with red and yellow trimming.</i>

450
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:31,692
<i>- Red and yellow. Good price?</i>
<i>- We'll agree on something.</i>

451
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:34,429
<i>Yellow and red.</i>
<i>That's very good. Thank you.</i>

452
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:38,133
<i>Salt! Salt! Salt!</i>

453
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:45,139
- Hello. Here you are.
- Hello.

454
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,307
- What do you want in exchange?
- A basket.

455
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,374
<i>There you go.</i>

456
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:27,381
- Hi.
- Hi.

457
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:32,189
Is your house that way?
So is our house.

458
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,892
Your shoes are pretty.
Did you just buy them?

459
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:38,991
My dad bought them for me.

460
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:41,400
What did you do
with your old shoes?

461
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,597
My mom threw them out.

462
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,607
She threw them out?

463
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,974
- Why? What for?
- They were torn.

464
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:03,516
When I get good grades,
my dad buys me something.

465
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,788
This time he bought me shoes.

466
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:23,196
Sir! My name is not there.

467
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:26,673
- Sir! Didn't I pass? I ran well!
- My name is not there either.

468
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:28,733
Why are you protesting?

469
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,870
You can't all be selected.

470
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:33,039
Only five or six students
from each school.

471
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:35,049
God willing, you'll make it next time.

472
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,381
Move out of the way. Come on.

473
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:44,783
<i>Aren't they lucky?</i>
<i>Two weeks in Ramsar. Good for them.</i>

474
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:47,852
<i>Taqizadeh is on the list.</i>
<i>Look, Hoseini.</i>

475
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:57,628
"First prize:
Two weeks at a holiday camp
and a set of sport suits.

476
01:07:57,707 --> 01:08:00,904
"Second prize:
Two weeks at a holiday camp
and school supplies.

477
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:03,911
Third prize:
One week at a holiday camp
and a pair of sneakers."

478
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,280
"A pair of sneakers."

479
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:17,558
- With permission, sir.
<i>- Come in.</i>

480
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:25,326
- What do you want?
- Sir, I want to be in the race.

481
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:29,201
Are you serious?
You are a little too late!

482
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,331
Where were you? Asleep?

483
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:34,933
Sir, I forgot.

484
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:38,605
You missed your chance.
Don't forget next time.

485
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:41,206
Sir, I want to be in this race.

486
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,911
- No way, my boy.
- Please, sir.

487
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,716
- I said no.
- Sir, I want so much
to be in this race.

488
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,781
It is not up to you
to decide, my boy.

489
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,259
You missed the test,
and the deadline is up.

490
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:55,092
Sir, please do something.
Let me be part of the race.

491
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:57,962
You are really pigheaded.
When I say you can't, you can't.

492
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:00,399
Get out of here.

493
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:04,337
<i>Please, sir, I promise to win.</i>

494
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:07,375
<i>Please, sir,</i>
<i>please register my name.</i>

495
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:13,114
Please, sir, I can run very fast.

496
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:16,845
I'll leave everyone behind.
I promise to win.

497
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,087
<i>Please, sir, register my name.</i>

498
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:11,630
- Zahra, I have good news.
- What news?

499
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:16,101
I was selected for the race.

500
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:20,615
- What race?
- Long-distance running.

501
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:24,084
The third-best runner
gets a pair of new sneakers.

502
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:26,087
Why the third?

503
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:30,285
<i>The first and second prizes</i>
<i>are something else.</i>

504
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:38,095
If I come in third,
I'll give you the sneakers.

505
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:41,793
But those shoes are for boys.

506
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:46,968
I'll exchange them. I'll get a pair
of girl's shoes for you.

507
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,437
What if you don't come in third?

508
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:52,844
I'll be third for sure.

509
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:53,033
Help the boys get ready. It's late.

510
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:55,235
Get down! Hurry up!

511
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,605
Come on, boys. Come on.

512
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:01,877
Take off your clothes.

513
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,620
<i>Come on. Hurry up.</i>

514
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,103
Come on, boy. Hurry up.

515
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:50,558
Attention! Dear children,
the race is four kilometers.

516
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:54,966
The finish line is
on the other side of the lake.

517
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:59,098
<i>Don't push the other runners.</i>
<i>Winning isn't everything.</i>

518
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:03,201
<i>The important thing is sportsmanship.</i>
<i>Good luck to you all.</i>

519
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:06,805
Now, ready, one, two...

520
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:20,232
<i>- Why are you late?</i>
<i>- I'm not late. I ran all the way.</i>

521
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:23,073
<i>Come on. Give me the shoes.</i>
<i>I'm late for school.</i>

522
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:29,681
<i>The sneakers are very dirty.</i>
<i>I'm ashamed to wear them.</i>

523
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,620
<i>I won't wear these anymore.</i>

524
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:39,024
<i>It's all your fault.</i>
<i>You lost my shoes.</i>
<i>Find them or I'll tell Dad.</i>

525
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:42,586
<i>If I come in third,</i>
<i>I'll give you the sneakers.</i>

526
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,830
<i>What if you don't come in third?</i>

527
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:23,268
<i>I'll be third for sure.</i>

528
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,202
"70 Meters"

529
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:43,811
"50 Meters"

530
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:54,515
"30 Meters"

531
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:36,521
- Bravo, Ali! Bravo, Ali!
- Did I come in third, sir?

532
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:39,590
Why third, my dear?
You were first.

533
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,727
Bravo! You won the race.

534
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:03,023
You'll win next time.

535
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,304
Bring Ali.

536
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,657
<i>Look this way, all of you.</i>

537
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:40,456
Look here.

538
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:56,276
Please move away.
I want his picture alone.

539
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,315
Hold your head high, champ.

540
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,852
<i>Hold your head up!</i>

541
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,859
<i>One more.</i>

542
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:49,621
