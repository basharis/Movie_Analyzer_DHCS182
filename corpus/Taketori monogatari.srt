1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:09,216
A TOHO PRODUCTION

2
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:33,057
PRINCESS FROM THE MOON

3
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,410
Make way!

4
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,253
Make way!

5
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,016
Make way!

6
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,330
Make way for the high priest!

7
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,540
Hurry!

8
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,973
Anyone in the way...

9
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,652
grind them into the ground!

10
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,529
Vermin!

11
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,494
Hurry!

12
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,017
Taketori.

13
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,612
It's Uda, the merchant.

14
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,814
I'm here to buy your goods.

15
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,217
Hey! Anybody home?

16
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,255
Unlocked?

17
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,938
Hello, Taketori's wife.

18
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,971
Go home.

19
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,860
As you can see, I've got nothing to sell.

20
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,209
But I...

21
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,688
So you're here.

22
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,136
What's wrong?

23
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,012
Your wife sent me away.

24
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,214
What happened?

25
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,209
We lost our daughter yesterday.

26
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,168
What? Your pretty daughter, Kaya?

27
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,020
She fell sick and died quickly.

28
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,939
How old?

29
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,410
Five.

30
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,249
You must be discouraged.

31
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,016
But I hope you'll work again soon.

32
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,056
Your bamboo ware and her cloth...

33
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,452
They both sell well in town.

34
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,170
Then pay us more.

35
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,417
I'll be back.

36
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,779
What are you doing?

37
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,139
Why?

38
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,849
Why did Kaya die?

39
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,214
Because we have little money?

40
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,412
Forget it.

41
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,415
Blaming poverty won't console us.

42
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,415
We couldn't afford a doctor.

43
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,170
How can I forget it?

44
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,059
I had her when I most gave up.

45
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,091
I wish I died with her.

46
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,218
Eat something.

47
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,333
You haven't eaten since yesterday.

48
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,658
Why couldn't it have been me instead?

49
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,652
Still grieving!

50
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,095
It won't bring her back alive.

51
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,818
Give it up.

52
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,250
Get out of here!

53
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,850
It's the bamboo forest.

54
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,733
Something's burning.

55
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,812
Kaya's grave is there.

56
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,770
I can't let it be burned.

57
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,813
Wait. You can't go now.

58
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,136
And I can't lose the bamboo woods.

59
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,972
I'd lose my livelihood.

60
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,368
Kaya.

61
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,050
You've saved the bamboo.

62
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,689
Thanks.

63
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,578
A baby?

64
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,612
But it's strange.

65
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,218
Can I leave it here?

66
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,737
Hard luck.

67
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,291
Anyway, I'll take you home.

68
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,457
The village master will rear you.

69
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,891
We're too poor to do it.

70
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,848
What? It's warm!

71
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,610
Stop squirming!

72
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,773
Where is it?

73
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,054
Kaya!

74
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,414
So many trees burned down!

75
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,219
Was this the reason?

76
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,780
How was this made?

77
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,249
Something's been burning.

78
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,257
How strange.

79
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,489
Kaya?

80
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,050
Kaya?

81
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,170
Kaya!

82
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,733
Kaya!

83
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,297
My daughter! You're back!

84
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,529
Wait.

85
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,099
Listen.

86
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,617
I found a baby in the woods.

87
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,659
It was in this cradle.

88
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,575
I was shocked.

89
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,939
It grew quickly into a girl.

90
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,370
Here she is.

91
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,938
Are you listening?

92
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,858
Isn't it strange?

93
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,052
But she's none other than Kaya.

94
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,648
You're wrong.

95
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,375
Her eyes...

96
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,617
Blue eyes.

97
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,413
Kaya's were dark.

98
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,411
You see?

99
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,736
She has a ball.

100
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,616
A crystal ball.

101
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,009
She keeps it.

102
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:22,852
Look.

103
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,530
She must be heaven's gift
to console our deep sorrow.

104
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,497
So you brought her here.

105
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,616
Let's adopt her.

106
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,011
We don't know her.

107
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,459
Kaya!

108
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,616
Blue eyes!

109
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,219
A ghost!

110
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,539
Kaya's ghost!

111
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,537
Blue eyes!

112
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,450
Blue eyes!

113
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,729
You're laughing at us.

114
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,056
Take that!

115
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,539
She hurt my son's head.

116
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,335
She let go of my game.

117
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,856
I'm sorry. Please forgive her.

118
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,411
Some evil spirit got into her.

119
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,214
Her eyes turned blue.

120
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,771
Maybe she set fire to the shrine.

121
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,454
You must keep your eyes on her.

122
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,575
One more incidents will finish you.

123
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,890
That's right!

124
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,850
Right.

125
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,975
Day in day out I say I'm sorry.

126
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,336
They believe she's our real child.

127
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,698
We're doing alright, aren't we?

128
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,650
They blame Kaya for everything.

129
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,495
Why, you think so, too?

130
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,493
I'm glad.

131
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,094
Your father knows you're innocent.

132
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,619
Father? Me?

133
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,579
No. I didn't adopt her.

134
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,736
Only you think she's your child.

135
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,650
Nonsense!

136
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,298
Your affection for her is unusual.

137
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,619
Maybe so it is, as you say.

138
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,457
But I want to believe she's mine.

139
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,809
Please let me.

140
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,220
Trash, isn't it?

141
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,170
A bamboo maker found it.

142
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,616
It's part of a container.

143
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,529
He wants to sell it, but...

144
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,778
I don't think it's of any value.

145
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,009
Look.

146
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,369
See the sun.

147
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,896
What colour?

148
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,219
It's green.

149
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,337
It proves it's gold.

150
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,098
Not for cheap chasers like me.

151
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,335
It's pure gold.

152
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,810
Sold?

153
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,409
Hands.

154
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,288
Your hands.

155
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,455
Both of them.

156
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,254
Careful.

157
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,735
Listen.

158
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:58,694
This is just between you and me.

159
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,015
A secret.

160
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,496
Do you have anymore?

161
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,011
Give me that!

162
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,133
Where is it? Give it to me!

163
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,849
Where is what?

164
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,373
The cradle I found Kaya in.

165
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,533
You threw it away with the trash.

166
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,935
Here it is!

167
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,255
Here it is!

168
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,219
I've got it.

169
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,698
Listen. This is gold. Pure gold!

170
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:17,250
With this,we'll be poor no more.

171
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,613
I don't understand.

172
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,256
It's Kaya's.

173
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,813
Ours!

174
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,410
We're rearing the girl heaven sent.

175
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,537
So this is heaven's gift for us.

176
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,854
Your majesty.

177
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,017
I took my time to check something...

178
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,491
before I discuss it here today.

179
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,536
So I'm late.

180
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,011
Let's discuss it later.

181
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,412
I understand, Councillor Otomo.

182
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,608
Take your seat.

183
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:31,299
We've been hearing the report
about the strange incident...

184
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,335
that happened the other night.

185
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,094
Resume your report.

186
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,133
Continue.

187
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,929
The ground around the big hollow...

188
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,939
was scorched as if hundreds of...

189
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,133
thunderboIts hit it all at once.

190
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,857
A moment before the disaster...

191
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,971
a big fireball was seen...

192
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,336
flying across the sky to the hill...

193
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,731
at an amazing speed.

194
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,810
Some villagers saw it.

195
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,979
The report was made by a spy
who is working for the court.

196
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,457
He's there.

197
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,373
Prince as chief of the library...

198
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,496
you're learned.

199
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,576
Does any book of yours tell us...

200
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,971
about such a disaster?

201
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,013
No. Well...

202
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,772
I'II have it checked.

203
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,253
You don't know?.

204
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,655
You seem to prefer girls to books.

205
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,648
No wonder.

206
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,212
Abe, you take things for granted.

207
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,373
I'm modest.

208
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,332
I don't like to brag.

209
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,651
What do you say, Reverend?

210
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:19,454
This incident is serious.

211
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,816
So is the matter I'm checking.

212
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,091
I found some unknown gold in town.

213
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,216
Gold?

214
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,733
Raise the curtain.

215
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,179
Tell me more.

216
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,090
Yes.

217
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,618
I took the gold to our mint...

218
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,816
for close examination.

219
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,016
And they found this:

220
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,373
It's extremely pure gold.

221
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,215
No mine in our country can...

222
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,211
produce gold of such quality.

223
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,213
I don't think we can overlook it.

224
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,057
Reverend Doson?

225
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,296
Somebody came from
a foreign land in secret.

226
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,969
I don't hunger for gold.

227
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,773
But it determines a nation's fate.

228
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,377
Sometimes it disturbs the reign.

229
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,057
We must find where it came from...

230
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,170
and confiscate all of it.

231
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,534
Weaving threads of various colours...

232
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,935
is a new trick to me.

233
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,857
I've brought blue cloth today.

234
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,169
Very good.

235
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,933
A certain nobleman ordered it.

236
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,731
Well, then...

237
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,016
there you go.

238
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,492
Thank you for giving me the job.

239
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,210
You're great. I admire you.

240
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,336
Your man either idles or drinks.

241
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,329
We must work as long as we live.

242
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,294
By the way...

243
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,016
Tell me something.

244
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,411
About the thing...

245
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,653
how much do you have?

246
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,575
He gives me only a little at a time.

247
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,098
I know nothing about it.

248
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,009
So you're in here?

249
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,816
You sold your cloth?

250
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,013
I told you not to.

251
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,815
We don't have to work anymore.

252
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,415
No more shady deals with Uda.

253
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,619
But you wanted money.

254
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,816
If it's clean.

255
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,050
Oh, I'm sorry!

256
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,378
The wrong place.

257
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,609
Come on, let's go.

258
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,211
Excuse us.

259
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,418
Strange.

260
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,613
It looks like our house.

261
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,210
Still drunk?

262
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,212
I'm Kaya.

263
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,217
What?

264
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,012
Are you Kaya?

265
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,613
So it's Kaya!

266
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,215
Yes.

267
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,816
Nonsense!

268
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,416
Now you're speaking!

269
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,218
Your eyes are dark.

270
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,211
She has the image of little Kaya.

271
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,218
It's Kaya.

272
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,212
How can you be so simple?

273
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,215
As I thought, she isn't normal.

274
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,812
She's growing up fast, that's all.

275
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,779
I like that.

276
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,217
She was a baby when I found her.

277
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,018
Now she's...

278
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,414
She doesn't know why.

279
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,014
Do you, Kaya?

280
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,732
No.

281
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,210
Nor where you came from?

282
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,209
No.

283
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,212
I don't understand.

284
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,013
How could she grow up so fast?

285
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,614
I believe this is divine grace.

286
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,210
Heaven gave us a girl.

287
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,619
Now she's big and beautiful.

288
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,816
I'm so happy to have her.

289
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,809
Thank you so much.

290
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,417
Aren't you going to work?

291
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,211
How long must you spy on others?

292
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,771
Ask for a transfer.

293
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,210
Why?

294
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,017
No promotions.

295
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,009
This time I'll get one.

296
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,816
I'll be a courtier at the palace.

297
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,613
You won't have to work like that.

298
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,608
Hey!

299
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,449
If it isn't Fujiwara! WeIcome!

300
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,612
I've been so busy I couldn't come.

301
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,617
You're to blame.

302
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,017
You exaggerate things.

303
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,010
Abig hollow was made.

304
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,289
And you reported it as a disaster.

305
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,497
But it was extraordinary.

306
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,896
It has some connection with...

307
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,331
the gold discussed at the court.

308
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,019
-What?
- Listen.

309
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:40,094
I found a seemingly humble man...

310
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,934
spending a lot at the market.

311
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,578
I followed him.

312
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,418
He lived near the big hollow.

313
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,496
Coincidence.

314
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,009
Good spies like me know better.

315
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,939
He had a graceful, pretty daughter,

316
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,817
a rare asset of the village.

317
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,019
Her beauty was even mysterious.

318
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,416
Then...

319
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,492
During the period I watched his house...

320
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,218
all his family suddenly moved away.

321
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,649
I don't know where to.

322
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,819
They bother me.

323
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,017
Who?

324
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,619
Those men who want to see Kaya.

325
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,210
I can't sleep.

326
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,017
They're all around this house.

327
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,409
Neither Kaya or I mind them.

328
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,818
You don't have to work anymore.

329
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,816
Why do you think we came here...

330
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,609
far from the village?

331
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,815
Kaya grew up fast; we grew rich.

332
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,616
We must divert suspicion from us.

333
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,816
There's another reason.

334
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,415
The noblemen and rich men in town...

335
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,210
have their country houses here.

336
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,809
So what?

337
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,815
Can't you see?

338
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,210
Kaya is beautiful.

339
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,619
We must find her a nice groom.

340
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,819
A groom?!

341
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,013
Of course!

342
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,417
If she marries a nobleman...

343
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,012
we'll be respected as her parents.

344
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,018
Kaya's not an ordinary girl.

345
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:49,218
It's our duty to make her happy.

346
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,417
That's a very selfish idea.

347
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,615
But if you think of her happiness...

348
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,015
you must notice how she behaves.

349
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,010
Huh?

350
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,416
What do you mean?

351
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,216
She always has that crystal ball.

352
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,015
Wha...?

353
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,618
She gazes into it all day long.
It's quite unusual.

354
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,611
I'm not here on business today.

355
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,051
We have a poor harvest this year.

356
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,210
Please reduce the tax.

357
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,417
I said I'm not here on business.

358
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,133
It's about the girl.

359
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,208
Yes,yes. I hear she's beautiful.

360
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,413
They say her beauty is heavenly.

361
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,213
She looks so to peasants.

362
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,211
How will she look to me?

363
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,615
Take me to her house.

364
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,016
Who is that girl?

365
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,814
She works here nursing the baby.

366
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,620
Akeno, excuse yourself.

367
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,813
I'll take some flowers to her.

368
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,018
Hey, woman. Pick some flowers for me.

369
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,613
Three red and two yellow.

370
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,417
Minister, she's blind.

371
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,497
Eh? Blind?

372
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,212
Can she work?

373
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,209
The baby seems to love her.

374
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:40,410
She's an orphan. No relatives.

375
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,695
How can you tell?

376
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,414
By the smell.

377
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,213
Simple water.

378
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,779
Oh, I didn't expect you here.
 
379
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,419
Have you come to check some books?

380
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,617
What are you checking, minister?

381
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,810
Please wait a while.

382
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,214
You're trying to outwit me.

383
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,611
I knew you'd come here, too.

384
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,257
Have you seen the girl?

385
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,409
Not yet.

386
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,609
She's said to look beautiful.

387
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,534
If she is, what will you do?

388
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,817
You're a married man.

389
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,691
What will you do?

390
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,411
Our parents chose our wives...

391
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,415
for their own reasons.

392
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,611
We can divorce them.

393
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,012
But a rumour is a rumour.

394
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,211
Maybe she's a homely country girl.

395
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,618
This is Kaya, my daughter.

396
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,214
Watch out!

397
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,216
Get back!

398
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,011
Wait!

399
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,415
What are you doing?

400
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,811
Looking for my stick.

401
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,335
This?

402
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,769
Thank you...

403
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,499
Your hands! They're cold!

404
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,732
Why not pick it up?

405
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,859
I'm blind.

406
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,013
Blind? What do you mean?

407
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,854
You don't know what 'blind'' means?

408
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,651
Your name?

409
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,089
Kaya.

410
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,493
So you're the new girl here.

411
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,095
Where are you from?

412
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,254
Where were you born?

413
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,295
I don't know.

414
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,089
Very funny!

415
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,415
I mean it.

416
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,613
That's what I want to know.

417
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,010
You have parents?

418
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,617
Yes.

419
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,211
You're strange.

420
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,695
You're not an ordinary girl.

421
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:14,209
There's an old Chinese book...

422
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,612
about a girl who worked miracles.

423
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,058
I know well about books.

424
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,691
My father was a doctor.

425
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,296
What are your parents like?

426
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,810
They passed away.

427
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,217
Dead.

428
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:42,017
I must be going. I'm on an errand.

429
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,812
Can we meet again?

430
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,409
My name is Akeno.

431
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,015
It means ''a field at dawn.''

432
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,453
Empress, here's my poem.

433
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,294
Your poem?

434
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,978
A hymn to the feminine charm?

435
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,816
Read it.

436
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,012
It's all about a very beautiful girl.

437
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,817
<i>Her celestial beauty deserves</i>

438
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,014
<i>The name of Kaguya, a shining lady.</i>

439
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,817
Please listen to mine.

440
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,488
<i>The spring breeze brings me</i>

441
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,054
<i>Melancholy, because of Kaguya.</i>

442
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,855
Similar poems.

443
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,968
A coincidence!

444
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,773
Who's Kaguya?

445
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,010
A girl called Kaya.

446
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:00,893
I call her Kaguya, meaning shining lady.

447
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,018
So you both are in love with her?

448
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,529
She must be very special.

449
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,536
And she's rich.

450
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,297
Men are talking about her.

451
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,298
A humble girl.

452
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,495
No good.

453
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,215
I formally asked her to marry me.

454
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,615
Not only you.

455
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,174
I proposed to her,too.

456
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,333
You sound serious this time.

457
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,416
So she infatuates all men.

458
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,258
Make way for us!

459
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,774
We were turning the corner!

460
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,849
Get a move on!

461
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,578
What's happened?

462
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:58,778
-That cart has us blocked.
-Your fault!

463
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,098
Who do you think our master  is?

464
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,216
We're stuckhere.

465
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,136
Wait.

466
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,697
I'm in a hurry.

467
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,411
Pull your cart aside.

468
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,210
Then make your servants help us.

469
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,251
Mother!

470
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,416
Mother!

471
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,458
The ball shone.

472
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,175
What? Shone?

473
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,974
It isn't shining.

474
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,652
Only for a moment.

475
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,252
Did it happen before?

476
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,377
No.

477
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,211
You imagined it.

478
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,531
No. It really shone.

479
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,135
Kaya.

480
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,368
You care about the ball because...

481
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,814
you think...

482
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:16,851
it can tell you where you come from.

483
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,809
Right?

484
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:25,219
Have you found out who you are?

485
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:27,811
No.

486
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,618
We're now parents and daughter.

487
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,210
We're living together.

488
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:41,208
Please forget about your birth.

489
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,019
Please do.

490
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,412
She worries about you so much.

491
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,017
You'd better forget the ball.

492
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:01,014
I know you come here often.

493
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:07,019
This is not where you were found...

494
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,697
but I understand how you feel.

495
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,855
I'm sorry about the crystal ball.

496
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,210
That's alright.

497
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,457
You consider me your real child.

498
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,856
I'm really grateful.

499
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:37,612
But I want to know what I am.

500
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,214
You are my child.

501
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,536
What else?

502
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,855
You mustn't say you're not my real child.

503
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,017
Excuse me, but do you remember me?

504
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,016
You can't forget me...

505
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,812
because you were so angry.

506
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:18,933
I helped you get your cart going again...

507
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,014
but you left without a word.

508
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:27,091
it was easy to find your house.

509
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,370
I went to your gate...

510
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,936
but I dared not enter.

511
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,979
I can no longer hold myself back.

512
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,052
So I have taken a chance.

513
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,979
I'm Kaya's mother.

514
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,130
Oh, I didn't see you.

515
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,619
I'm Otomo.

516
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,010
You didn't tell me you met him.

517
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:57,976
Why?

518
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,010
I'd like to marry her.

519
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,415
I decided when I first met her.

520
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:12,009
I know there are other suitors, but...

521
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,252
I propose to you.

522
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,175
Excuse me.

523
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,259
Will you tell me what to do?

524
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,409
About getting married?

525
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:44,369
I must accept one of the suitors.

526
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:52,333
They say men prosper by marriage.

527
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,778
But I...

528
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,415
I see.

529
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,609
You're not an ordinary girl.

530
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,619
Still a girl is a girl.

531
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,890
People marry for love, don't they?

532
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,416
You want the love of one of them?

533
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,860
I can't see if he really loves me.

534
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,815
Nobody can. There's no way.

535
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:36,972
But you can test their sincerity.

536
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,018
You want to know more about them?

537
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,290
Then put them to a test.

538
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,208
How?.

539
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:56,810
It is an honour to have you here.

540
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,014
I highly appreciate your kindness.

541
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,213
I told my daughter to choose one...

542
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:11,648
of the three men who proposed.

543
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,531
She said it was difficult to say...

544
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,449
who was better than whom.

545
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,373
She'll marry the one...

546
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,458
who gives her what she wants.

547
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,648
That's a good idea.

548
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,613
Whatever she wants, just ask.

549
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:38,217
I'll be delighted to bring it.

550
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,653
There's nothing I can't get.

551
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,580
Name it, and you'll receive it.

552
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,696
Now, Kaya, tell them.

553
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,973
There are three objects.

554
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:03,772
One is a tree that yields diamonds...

555
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,211
with a gold trunk and...

556
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,812
silver roots, on Paradise Island.

557
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,769
Another is the Fire Rat Fleece...

558
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,292
of the golden rats that live...

559
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,332
in a volcano in China.

560
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:26,660
The other is on the head of

561
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,618
a dragon in the Indian Ocean:

562
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,132
The Dragon's Jewel.

563
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,575
Choose one for each, please.

564
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:40,213
They're all known as unreachable.

565
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,458
They're described in books.

566
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:49,848
But nobody has actually seen them.

567
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,739
A difficult task!

568
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,055
Thousands of powerful men have...

569
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,417
sought these treasures in vain.

570
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,809
Anyone who has even one of them...

571
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,214
will become immortal, so they say.

572
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,212
That's what I heard.

573
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:19,012
Immortality is man's eternal wish.

574
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:25,448
I don't think I deserve them.

575
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,455
You can refuse.

576
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,699
No, no, no! I'm not saying I refuse.

577
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:40,212
I already chose the Treasure Tree.

578
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,009
You're sly.

579
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,009
Why?

580
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,458
You've chosen the easiest.

581
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,654
The first to choose gets the best.

582
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:59,890
But I must go to the China Sea.

583
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,935
Then I'll search China...

584
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:07,333
for the Fire Rat Fleece.

585
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,216
Councillor.

586
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,936
You haven't spoken of your choice.

587
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,014
Is it too much for you?

588
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,219
The Dragon's Jewel is for me?

589
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,616
Then I'll go to India.

590
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,417
I never thought she'd ask you...

591
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,855
to do such difficult tasks.

592
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,100
None can accomplish them.

593
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:47,213
You must refuse for your own good.

594
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:52,338
She spoke out, and we accepted.

595
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,057
A real man won't back out.

596
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:20,416
This is a map of Paradise Island.

597
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,538
I have a plan.

598
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,378
Fusamori.

599
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,779
I have an idea.

600
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,535
Here's the money for the fleece, and...

601
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,099
To the south!

602
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,097
To the south!

603
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:23,014
Where is the councillor's ship?

604
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,095
That's what I'm thinking.

605
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:33,012
I opposed your marriage at first.

606
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,616
But not now.

607
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:43,217
The councillor is brave enough.

608
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:50,417
I trust he'll make you happy.

609
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:51,850
Yes.

610
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:58,208
Mother, I'm so happy at this moment.

611
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,018
So am I.

612
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,571
I know this is folly!

613
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,375
There aren't any dragons!

614
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:58,619
They're visions yielded by fear!
