1
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,685
And, here they come.

2
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,202
Stepping out onto the field.

3
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,249
In Europe and the world over,
this runner...

4
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,445
is known as the Indian saint.

5
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,652
He is India's Milkha Singh.

6
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,121
Milkha Singh

7
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,974
India's Milkha Singh
still holds the world record.

8
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:15,048
Can he win gold for
India in the 400m race?

9
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,433
On your mark.

10
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,431
Set.

11
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,809
The historic race has begun.

12
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:38,008
Milkha Singh leads...

13
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,105
It's time.

14
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,618
Will this be
India's first gold?

15
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:57,093
At 200mts the gold
is virtually in his pocket.

16
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,765
Run Milkha!

17
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,369
Run!

18
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,870
Run!

19
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:56,086
Why did he look back?

20
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,373
Hello?

21
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,481
Hello, Milkha?

22
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,114
Hello, Milkha?

23
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,985
Hello, Milkha?

24
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,295
What happened?

25
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,874
Ranvir, after the
Rome Olympics loss...

26
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,839
I understand Milkha's mental state.

27
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,214
But you see...

28
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,812
our Prime Minister and Pakistan's
President General Ayub Khan...

29
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,654
have great interest in
this contest. What do we tell them?

30
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,261
The announcements are made.

31
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:17,025
Milkha is our star. If he refuses,
it'll send the wrong signal.

32
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,601
Wrong signal?

33
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,362
It's about the upcoming
India-Pakistan Games

34
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,065
Oh yes, yes. Please sit.

35
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,903
These games aren't
just games but a means...

36
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,045
to bring our countries closer.

37
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,617
All the arrangements have been made,
sir. Everything is on it track?

38
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,513
But?

39
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,757
Our star Milkha refuses
to go to Pakistan.

40
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,731
Convince him.

41
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:54,201
We're trying. But since
he lost the Rome Olympics...

42
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,295
You win some, you lose some.

43
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,466
Mr. Prime Minister,

44
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,277
Pardon me. My name is Ranvir Singh.

45
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,439
Milkha Singh's coach.

46
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,538
This isn't about losing in Rome.

47
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,587
He refuses to go to Pakistan...

48
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,587
for personal reasons.

49
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,421
Mr. Wad hwa...

50
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,621
take Ranvir Singh...

51
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,562
and go and talk to Milkha.

52
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,023
Good morning, sir.

53
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,933
Oh good morning come.

54
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,802
Sir, this is Gurudev Singh.
I've told you about him.

55
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,031
Hello...

56
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,175
How are you, sir? - Very well.

57
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,701
Come in.

58
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:45,949
The Delhi to Chandigarh Amrapali Express
is about to leave from platform no. 1.

59
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,286
Milkha Singh listens to him...

60
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,326
so I requested him to come too.

61
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,154
Thanks for coming, Mr.
Gurudev Singh.

62
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,659
I hope you can
help persuade Milkha.

63
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,265
Read this?

64
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,303
I will not go to Pakistan.

65
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,210
What is the reason?

66
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,547
It's a long story, sir.

67
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,020
Ourjourney to
Chandigarh is long too.

68
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,227
I first met Milkha 6 years ago.
In 1954...

69
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,605
at the Secunderabad
Army Regiment Centre.

70
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,503
Recruit Paras Shard a!

71
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,565
Sir!

72
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,704
Recruit Sehore. - Sir.

73
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,412
Recruit Gopal Singh. - Sir.

74
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,479
Cadet Sujit Chawla. - Sir.

75
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,584
Every year young
men enlist in the Army.

76
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,314
Milkha Singh was one of them.

77
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,289
Recruit Sahil. - Sir.

78
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,261
Recruit Suresh Kumar

79
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:03,923
Suresh Kumar?

80
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,563
Recruit Milkha Singh

81
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,570
Yes sir!

82
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,663
Yes, sir.

83
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,470
Two Milkha Singhs?

84
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,881
I'm Suresh Kumar, sir!

85
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,516
What took you so long?

86
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:22,808
Sorry, sir!

87
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,890
You have a shrill voice.
Why did you join the army?

88
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,485
To fight, sir!

89
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,224
To fight? Or sing lullabies?
Can you roar at the enemy?

90
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,658
I can, sir! - Let's hear you.

91
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,759
Attack!

92
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:40,826
Silence!

93
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,296
No laughing!

94
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,472
He can roar. He has balls.

95
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,272
Enemy, I'm coming!

96
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,217
From now you're no
longer Suresh Kumar...

97
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,947
but Miss Suresh

98
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,716
Damned if you do...

99
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,816
damned if you don't.

100
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,451
Who spoke?

101
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,524
Who spoke?

102
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:17,997
You?

103
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,768
I did sir.

104
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,411
So, you did!

105
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,210
Yes, sir.

106
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,013
You think I'm a clown?

107
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,414
No, sir.

108
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,583
That you are a hero?
- No, sir.

109
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,955
No butting in.

110
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,289
Got it?

111
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,159
Got what?

112
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:44,961
No butting in!

113
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:53,501
Collect your treasures!
Your trunk and plate.

114
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,740
No wives in sight.

115
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,337
He forgot mug.

116
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,377
You said something?

117
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,382
Sir, this mug.

118
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,507
<i>NW9-</i>

119
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:08,787
This is to drink, bathe and wash.

120
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,092
Got it?

121
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,150
Sir!

122
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,896
One-two-one.

123
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,336
One. - Squad two.

124
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,941
Squad one. - One.

125
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,203
Squad two. - Two.

126
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,538
Squad one. - One.

127
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,738
Squad two. - Two.

128
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:29,905
Squad one. - One.

129
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,139
Squad two. - Two.

130
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,273
Just, one-two.

131
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,623
Jump-

132
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,860
Everyone.

133
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,176
Remember. Your field of action,
is your practice area.

134
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,874
And your duty is your penance.

135
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,814
He's always yelling.

136
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,676
Do this! Do that!

137
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,847
Will you eat? No? Then don't!

138
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,721
Imagine him talking to his wife...

139
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,157
Give me a kiss.

140
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,252
How about it!

141
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:24,793
Turn around. - Turn. No.

186
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,509
Attention!

187
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,053
There will be a race tomorrow.

188
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,954
The centre Coach Gurudev
Singh will explain.

189
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,485
At ease!

190
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,992
My name is Gurudev Singh.

191
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,302
The Indian Army is
ready at all times

192
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,967
to serve and
protect the country.

193
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,339
Besides that...

194
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,105
the Indian army
has also given India...

195
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,778
its' finest sportsmen.

196
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,043
Tomorrow...

197
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,823
you will run
a cross country race...

198
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,157
six miles long.

199
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:48,122
The ten fastest...

200
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,527
will be personally
trained by me.

201
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,670
To compete in the
coming brigade games...

202
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,039
representing our unit.

203
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:02,677
Have any of you run before?

204
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:06,905
When?

205
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,609
A mad dog once chased me.
I ran all the way home.

206
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,544
Quiet!

207
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:14,890
And you?

208
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,291
Much the same story, sir.

209
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,224
You morons. That's not
the kind of running I mean.

210
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,196
This is a contest.

211
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,560
To get ahead of the others.

212
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,437
Any questions?

213
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,836
NO, sir!

214
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:32,801
One more thing...

215
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:37,814
no more fatigue duty
for the ten best runners.

216
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,717
A special diet too...

217
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,410
a glass of milk
and two raw eggs.

218
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,511
Attention!

219
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:48,847
Disperse!

220
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,323
One-two-three-one..

221
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,487
Hail India!

222
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,763
I'll win for the unit's honour.

223
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,335
We have to win.

224
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,704
Hear that?
No fatigue duty for the top ten.

225
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,878
No cutting grass.
I'll run like life depends on it!

226
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:13,443
All I can think about is the milk.

227
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,289
Taran, put in all your strength...

228
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,898
you have to get
your fatigue excused.

229
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,160
Come on!

230
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,056
Why are you sitting here?

231
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,687
Stomach cramps. Can't move.

232
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,922
Think of the milk.

233
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,388
Come on.

234
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:16,695
Milk! Milk!

235
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,109
Milk! Milk!

236
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,410
Milk! Milk!

237
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,261
Run to beat everyone.

238
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,194
Run to come first.

239
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,132
Young man!

240
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,766
You ran well.

241
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,531
What happened?

242
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,307
Stomach cramps, sir.

243
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,307
We'll work on that.

244
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,103
Yes, sir!

245
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,046
Come on.

246
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,644
Eggs and milk!

247
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,893
It's back to fatigue duty for me...

248
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,530
It's ok, Taran.

249
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,273
Here...

250
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,905
you drink it.

251
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,305
Drink it.

252
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,007
You drink it.

253
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,378
You drinking or me,
it's the same thing.

254
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,577
What about you?
- You love milk.

255
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,969
You drinking or me, same thing.

256
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,442
Then I'll finish all of it.

257
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,677
Shameless boy!

258
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,115
Little devil!

259
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,654
Chawli, I'm ready to eat.

260
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:19,718
Your chair.
- Keep sitting...

261
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,023
Let's play...

262
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,996
spot the middle finger, Milkhu.

263
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,998
Ready?

264
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,200
The middle finger.

265
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,877
Got it...

266
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,407
Sure.

267
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,106
Sure. - Yes.

268
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,750
You win!

269
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:44,509
Your turn.

270
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,226
Hold it.

271
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,022
Here you go.

272
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,241
No holding back when you eat.

273
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,267
Ishri, don't you feed your husband?

274
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,103
He's become so thin.

275
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:11,836
Milkha.

276
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,684
I hear you're learning
English at school.

277
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,613
Yes, brother-in-law.

278
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:23,384
Say something.
We can learn some too.

279
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,261
Come on.

280
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,191
Come on son.

281
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,391
Go ahead!

282
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,630
Go ahead!

283
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,072
<i>King cat mouse ham 'm the house</i>

284
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:49,414
King means Emperor.
- Everyone knows that!

285
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,885
Is hatti English?

286
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,944
Maybe.

287
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,416
Go on.

288
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,491
King cat mouse in the house.
C for cat in the fields.

289
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,665
Twinkle-Twinkle little star"

290
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,598
King cat mouse in the house.

291
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,168
My Milkhu speaks such good English.

292
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,134
A proper Englishman.

293
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,980
That's why I send him to school.

294
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,440
So he can be a somebody.

295
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:23,783
What will you be when you grow up?

296
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,288
A soldier, father.

297
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:32,488
My little soldier!
Milkha Singh, Salute!

298
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,536
You make us late everyday.

299
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,873
We'll be on time.

300
00:27:55,707 --> 00:28:01,521
The teacher will cane our backside.

301
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,818
And then?

302
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,049
Red Bums!

303
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:12,328
Red are tomatoes, red is the maiden's
veil, red like Sampreefs bum.

304
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,894
Milkha's bum.
- No, Sampreefs bum

305
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,873
Milkha's bum.
- No, Sampreefs bum

306
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,841
Milkha.. - Come on.

307
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:27,314
Red are tomatoes, red is the maiden's
veil, red like Sampreefs bum.

308
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,283
Q for...

309
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,551
Queen

310
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,491
Queen means?

311
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,459
S for... - Sun

312
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,223
Sun means..

313
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,697
R for... - Rose

314
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,430
Rose means?

315
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,469
Bum..

316
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,473
Milkha's red bum.

317
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,069
No. yours!

318
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,274
Sampreefs red bum.

319
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,647
Your bum will turn red too,
if you get caned.

320
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,686
Sampreefs red bum!

321
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:04,980
Your red bum.

322
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,160
Stop.

323
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,898
My feet are on fire.

324
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:25,840
Come in the shade.

325
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,871
I have to reach home.

326
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:32,981
Let's wait till it's cooler.

327
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,914
We'll run across the dunes.

328
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,749
You nuts? Your feet will roast.

329
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,480
I'm off!

330
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:45,058
Hey... hey...
Listen to me, Sardar.

331
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,807
Milkha...

332
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:43,643
you will now have to run 400...

333
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,889
400 means 400 meters.

334
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:53,853
Moron! Run one
lap around the track.

335
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,486
Just one?

336
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,461
Guruji, I can easily do 20 laps.

337
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,837
Not 20!

338
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:06,641
Put the effort of 20 laps in one.

339
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,800
Yes sir.

340
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,512
Remember one thing.

341
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,484
These races are very important.

342
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:21,580
The first three will
compete in the Brigade games.

343
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:28,156
They'll represent the Army.

344
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,791
Guru sir where are you going?

345
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:35,127
How are you?

346
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,941
How about some tea, butter milk?

347
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,634
Sure.

348
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,375
Milkha, I'll see you in a bit.

349
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,572
Yes. - Come on.

350
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,883
How are you, Taimoor? - Rana, sir.

351
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,880
You will lose this time.

352
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,684
How are your preparations? - Good.

353
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,119
Taimoor, how are your preparations?

354
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,090
Very good.

355
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,371
Where did you get that blazer?

356
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:49,767
Why?

357
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,605
I can see people who
wear one are more respected.

358
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,715
I want one too.

359
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,081
You do, do you?

360
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,981
Who are you?

361
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,159
I'm Milkha Singh.
EME Centre, Secunderabad Regiment,

362
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,315
an athlete.

363
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,219
And even excused from fatigue duty.

364
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:12,029
Come here Mr. Fatigue Excused.

365
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,240
This is the Indian team blazer.

366
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,073
It is not for riff-raffs.

367
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,072
Only for champions like me.

368
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,106
Got it?

369
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,878
Now run along.

370
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,082
Get lost!

371
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,517
Come on.

372
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:55,298
What are you looking at?
Smart Sikh!

373
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,277
Milkha is India.

374
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,043
Milkha is a champion.

375
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,119
Champion Milkha Singh.

376
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,630
Bloody thief!

377
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:24,729
Stealing my blazer?

378
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,167
No, I was just trying it on.

379
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,328
Trying it on, were you?

380
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,629
Bloody thief!

381
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,004
Don't call me a thief.

382
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,204
What else are you?

383
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,075
He's been eyeing it all day.

384
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,476
He's a thief.

385
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,444
Report him.

386
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,252
Think it's your pop's?

387
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,810
Get him suspended.

388
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,181
He's a thief.

389
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,420
Acting smart eh?

390
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:51,716
Strip the bugger.

391
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,927
I was only trying it on.

392
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,091
Think it's your pop's?

393
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,497
I was only trying it on.

394
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,003
I'm not a thief!

395
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,767
Let me go.

396
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,573
I'm not a thief!

397
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,194
Let him go!

398
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,132
We caught him stealing.
- Shut up!

399
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,099
I wasn't stealing.

400
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,692
You liar!

401
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,860
Calm down!

402
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,788
Why did you wear his blazer?

403
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:55,916
You want one?

404
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,220
An India team blazer?

405
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,127
Just like that, eh?

406
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,357
Hey, it's not that easy.

407
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,661
You must earn it.

408
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,700
Work bloody hard for it.
Be worthy of it.

409
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:20,508
You really want the blazer?

410
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,176
Then beat him.

411
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,282
Think you can?

412
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,979
Can you?

413
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,850
Yes I can.

414
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,194
You'll beat Sher Singh Rana?

415
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,900
Have you seen him run?

416
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:46,635
He's like a bullet.

417
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,037
Have you the guts?

418
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:53,172
Have you the guts?

419
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,039
Yes, I do.

420
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:06,685
You could try tomorrow.

421
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,831
You will beat a thousand
Sher Singh Ranas.

422
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:56,876
On your mark.

423
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,841
Set.

424
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,577
Come on, gallop!

425
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:03,645
Well done! Go! Go!

426
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,595
You ran well.

427
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,027
You'd be first if
it wasn't for the stone.

428
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,802
Gurudev, I choose him too.

429
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,332
Train him well.
- Yes sir

430
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,769
Well done!

431
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:49,874
Every time the stone won't
be so big that it comes in notice.

432
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,744
You must work hard...

433
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:56,922
so nothing comes in your way.

434
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,517
Yes, sir.

435
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,488
Come on.

436
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,333
Milkha Singh was a natural.

437
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:11,599
A gifted athlete.

438
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,101
We merely honed the diamond.

439
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:20,008
All that is very
interesting, but...

440
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,684
I still don't see
why he won't go to Pakistan.

441
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,112
Mr. Secretary, in 1947...

442
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:32,321
millions were
celebrating India's freedom.

443
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:37,929
While others were mourning
India's bloody partition.

444
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:42,329
Millions became refugees.

445
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,800
Milkha was among them.

446
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,515
His new village fell on the other
side of the border, in Pakistan.

447
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:58,943
He was just a kid.
10-12 years or so...

448
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:05,357
He came to Delhi,
narrowly escaping with his life.

449
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:07,996
He was all alone.

450
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,368

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,331

We'll fill the form.

466

My turn again.

493
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,518
Milkhu! Hold on tight.

494
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:33,308
I told your father:
Let's move to India...

495
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,648
we have no place in Pakistan.

496
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:46,191
But he said,
no...l will not leave my land!

497
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:51,498
What did their bravery get them?

498
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,681

Don't worry.

Never.

504
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,213
Ball. Ball. Ball.

505
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:29,477
Throw the ball.

00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,346

00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,440
It's been an hour.

00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,133
You damn...

525
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:11,469
He's just a child!

526
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,909
Get out!

527
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,043
He's just a child!

528
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,748
I'll fix you.

529
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,183
Get lost!

530
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,182
Get lost!

531
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:38,533
Get lost!

532
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,099
No, Milkhu!

533
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,308
Over here!

534
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:24,975
If you are alive

535
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:30,717
Take it full on

536
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,593
Crush it into powder

537
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:39,895
With your feet

538
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:42,329
Take this pot of life

539
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,801
Drink it in one shot

540
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,000
Why die a little everyday

541
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,600
Give it your all
and die with Gusto

542
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,506
Coal is black

543
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,673
Brought up by the mountains

544
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:58,181
Black on the surface, black
underneath, black to the core

545
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:02,189
But the bugger is for real

546
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:06,049
If you are alive

547
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:12,028
Take it full on

548
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,226
Take this pot of life

549
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,497
Drink it in one shot

550
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,866
Why die a little everyday

551
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:22,067
Give it your all
and die with Gusto

552
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,438
Coal is black

553
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,570
Brought up by the mountains

554
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:30,112
Black on the surface, black
underneath, black to the core

555
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,779
But the bugger is for real

556
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:42,626
Crush it into powder

557
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:48,599
With your feet

558
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:01,873
Why let these dreams
stop your feet

559
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:06,352
Untangle the threads,
free you stride

560
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:11,323
Who keeps accounts of yesterday
Who knows about tomorrow

561
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:15,756
irrigate the moment

562
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,695
Place the burning
flame on your tongue

563
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,334
Then even your
burnt lips shall sing

564
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:22,333
Your wounds shall hum

565
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:26,804
And your pain shall
become a melody

566
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:42,313
If you are alive

567
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:48,024
Take it full on

568
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:51,689
Crush it into powder

569
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:57,235
With your feet

570
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:12,750
Stop.

571
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:19,949
Come here.

572
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:24,922
At ease. Name?

573
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,731
Recruit Milkha Singh.

574
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:28,029
Out this late?

575
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,064
Training for the selection, sir!

576
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,939
Nights are for sleeping.
Train in the day.

577
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,401
No time in the day, sir!

578
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,044
I'll see about that.

579
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:44,607
Yes, sir.

580
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,045
Go and sleep.

581
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,144
Hail India, sir.

582
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:53,994
Left-right-left.

583
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:55,825
Left-right-left.

584
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,157
Squad. Attention!

585
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,699
Turn left.

586
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,701
Recruit Milkha Singh.
- Yes, sir.

587
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:09,935
What do you do at night?
- Sleep, sir!

588
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:11,837
Sleep? Or run?

589
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,442
Run. Then sleep, sir!

590
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,053
You complained you've no
time in the day, eh?

591
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:25,556
I don't, sir! I do, sir!

592
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:26,855
You do? Or don't?

593
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,230
I do and don't, sir!

594
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,092
You'll run in the day from now.

595
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,367
You're excused from fatigue duty.

596
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,138
Just run. Get it?

597
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,100
Yes sir!

598
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,176
What do you understand?
- Run in the day, sir!

599
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:48,815
And at night?
- Sleep, sir!

600
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,075
Now go! Do your running!

601
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,240
Yes, sir.

602
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:53,643
Go on!

603
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:56,681
Hail India!

604
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,998
Don't stop. Don't think.

605
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:13,803
Keep running, else you'll get
a kick on your ass.

606
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,034
Run!

607
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,672
Come on!

608
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,776
Come on!

609
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,680
What water does he drink?

610
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:30,616
That's sweat. Not water.

611
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:31,714
Sweat?

612
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,092
Milkha's sweat.

613
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,585
So much?

614
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,531
He fills a mug a day.

615
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:45,032
I thought he was mad, but I see
he's totally crazy now.

616
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:08,523
Milkha!

617
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:14,694
Milkha!

618
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:49,621
You please go ahead.

619
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,492
I am loved by all

620
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,788
A soldier of the country

621
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:28,230
Sing with me, Hail India!

622
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:35,632
I will grow up to
be the nation's pride

623
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:44,011
A shining star
in the world's eyes

624
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:50,516
I will forge ahead

625
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:57,154
Left right, left right, halt!

626
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,669
Take your buckets!

627
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,467
Here.

628
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:18,575
Listen.

629
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,254
Yes.
- I'll carry them for you.

630
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,682
Please.

631
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:25,753
They're heavy. Please let me.

632
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:27,386
Leave it.

633
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:28,484
No, it's fine.

634
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,363
Give it.
- No.

635
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:31,759
Give it, it's heavy.

636
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,100
What's going on here?

637
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,800
Is he teasing you?

638
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,194
No.

639
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,742
My lover resembles God

640
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:51,648
My beloved resembles God

641
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:01,618
My lover resembles God

642
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,062
My beloved resembles God

643
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:06,956
Should I love him or worship him

644
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,599
Should I love him or worship him

645
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:11,865
Isn't it one and the same?

646
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:15,034
Allah is the foremost

647
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:16,872
Allah is the foremost

648
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,343
This is close to my house.

649
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,202
Can't see anything.

650
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,571
Allah is the foremost

651
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:27,753
Allah is the foremost

652
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:32,892
Allah is the foremost

653
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:38,926
I told you I would help.

654
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:42,398
Helping your sister
or helping yourself?

655
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:46,996
So?

656
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,064
So?

657
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:49,837
Pick up the buckets!

658
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:51,270
I was working.

659
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,074
I know what's going on!

660
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,908
Why should I visit the temple?

661
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:58,451
When love is my God

662
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:05,958
Why should I visit a mosque?

663
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,594
When love is my God

664
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,253
Hey!

665
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:18,961
I'm in love with you.

666
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:20,162
What?

667
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:23,833
Water...

668
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,435
Should I love him or worship him

669
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:27,503
for you.

670
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,742
Should I love him or worship him

671
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,183
Isn't it one and the same?

672
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,785
Allah is the foremost

673
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:35,878
What's your name?

674
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,113
Sorry?

675
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:42,656
Odd name, sorry

676
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,521
Biro...

677
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:55,200
Your home...

678
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:07,081
My name is Milkha Singh.

679
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,755
My lover resembles God

680
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:18,354
My beloved resembles God

681
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:33,237
So Romeo is alone today?

682
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:37,414
Did someone else take the buckets?

683
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:49,696
Allah is the foremost

684
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:55,460
Allah is the foremost

685
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,871
You, a cascading
waterfall of divine light

686
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,278
I, an age old thirst

687
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:12,609
With my eyes I gulped

688
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,881
Those bountiful waters

689
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:24,558
I spend my life
just gazing at you

690
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:31,129
I immediately take off thoughts
of any other that tries to wrap me

691
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:36,102
Should I love him or worship him

692
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,810
Should I love him or worship him

693
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:41,370
Isn't it one and the same?

694
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:46,144
Allah is the foremost

695
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,253
I love you. Do you?

696
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,342
I love you too.

697
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:16,072
My feet dance the bhangra

698
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:18,675
While my breath taps the beat

699
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:27,092
I sing songs of
love wherever I go

700
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:30,295
Should I love him or worship him

701
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:32,862
Should I love him or worship him

702
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,661
Should I love him or worship him

703
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:37,499
What are you doing right now?

704
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,207
Allah is the foremost

705
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:43,570
Nothing much.

706
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:50,347
Allah is the foremost

707
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:56,451
Allah is the foremost

708
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,122
Do you remember me.

709
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:10,435
Who is this idiot?

710
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:17,542
Don't throw it so hard.
Father's ears turned red.

711
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,307
Didn't he go to work?
- It's a holiday.

712
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,472
Holiday.

713
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:25,279
Gandhiji's birth anniversary.

714
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,287
What is Gandhiji's holiday?

715
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:31,455
Gandhiji got us freedom
from the British.

716
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:34,457
So it's a national
holiday on his birthday.

717
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,424
National holiday?

718
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,927
We have national
holidays for important people.

719
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:51,503
One day there'll be a
holiday in Milkha's name.

720
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:55,040
In your name?

721
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,309
I do important things, too.

722
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,095
Where are you going?

723
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,598
Get off!

724
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:22,107
Stand straight!

725
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:25,403
Whose is it?

726
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:27,302
It's mine.

727
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:29,144
Not the cycle.

728
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,141
I'm talking about the butter tins.

729
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:33,213
Did you steal them?

730
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,154
What are you saying? No!

731
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:36,818
I worked hard for them.

732
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:38,286
Do you have a bill?

733
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,658
A bill for what? They're mine.

734
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:43,826
This is the Shahdara
police station.

735
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,897
Without a receipt you
can't take them past here.

736
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,529
Collect them when
you have the bill.

737
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:55,272
They go with me.

738
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:59,212
Do I have 'dumb ass'
printed on my forehead?

739
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,514
Sorry sir, I can't read.

740
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:14,056
It's good stuff.

741
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:16,996
Ok. Leave one and take one.

742
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,558
No, I will take them both.

743
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:20,823
You sure?

744
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:22,260
Oh yes...very sure.

745
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,466
What do you think you are doing?

746
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:41,112
What are you doing?
You will fall sick.

747
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:42,377
Move back.

748
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:47,958
Have you lost it?
- Move back.

749
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:49,527
Move back.

750
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:56,792
Move.

751
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,035
Move back.

752
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:23,789
...9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16..

753
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:28,995
...17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22..

754
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:32,502
...23, 24, 25, 26..

755
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:36,198
...27, 28, 29, 30..

756
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:39,711
"31, 32, 33, 34..

757
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:44,911
Shut up..
- ..35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40..

758
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:49,046
...41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46..

759
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:52,250
...47, 48, 49, 50.

760
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:57,619
Shut up!

761
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:03,867
What are you doing, Milkha?

762
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:20,312
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56..

763
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:21,715
...57..

764
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:27,522
...91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96..

765
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:33,192
Have you lost it?
- "97, 98, 99, 100!

766
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:51,177
Why one?
You can have them both now!

767
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:18,834
There is something about that boy.

768
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:29,787
These are the heroes of today...

769
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:32,319
those who rob and steal...

770
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:34,254
thieves and goons.

771
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:45,727
Biro!

772
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:53,835
Biro!

773
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:58,115
I want to marry you.

774
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:01,315
Don't be shy.

775
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:07,393
We'll have dozens of Kids.
Mahinder, Parminder, Jaswinder

776
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:11,128
Dharmender, Rajinder.
- To be thieves like you?

777
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,831
I'll give up all that.

778
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:30,274
You trust me, don't you?

779
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,622
I'll make something of my
life and come back for you.

780
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,459
Will you wait for me?

781
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,328
Yes.

782
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,137
Love can conquer anything.

783
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:06,242
He didn't ask for much.

784
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:12,087
Just a small business...
to help live an honest life.

785
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:18,664
But to earn money,
you need money don't you?

786
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:22,961
A thousand? Too much...

787
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:24,964
Do something!

788
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:27,870
We will need a year.

789
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,038
I don't have a year!

790
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,237
One big last job then.

791
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,686
No, no more stealing...

792
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:45,625
I don't want to be a thief.

793
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:49,524
Ticket please...

794
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,522
Ticket.

795
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:56,160
Milkha, you've got them?

796
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:58,596
No.

797
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:00,368
Look again.

798
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:04,900
Hurry HP!

799
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,377
There are other passengers too.

800
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,847
Stop.

801
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:11,645
Milkha, run!

802
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,177
Run!

803
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:18,752
Run! Milkha Run!

804
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,923
Why did you come here?
- Let's go.

805
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:42,531
Where are your gold earrings?

806
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:57,077
You sold them to post my bail,
didn't you?

807
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:05,652
I've always taken from you.

808
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,290
Don't talk nonsense!

809
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:11,724
Let's go home.

810
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,331
He struggled hard...

811
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:18,031
knocked at many a doors.

812
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:22,802
Ultimately,
the Army gave him respectability.

813
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:27,210
Maybe fate was now on his side.

814
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:32,850
You moron! Loosen up. Grip hard!

815
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,648
Fool! Lift your legs.

816
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:39,321
These shoes are full of nails.

817
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,050
I can't run in them.

818
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,253
Give it a try.

819
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:47,489
No sir... I can't...

820
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:50,095
Gurudev Singh..

821
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,065
Ranvir Singh.

822
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,639
How are you?

823
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:54,797
How are you?

824
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,241
Is this the stone boy?
- Yes.

825
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:02,014
Milkha, Ranvir Singh,
the Indian team coach.

826
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:05,678
Your blessings, sir.

827
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:07,409
God bless you.

828
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:09,113
How are you?

829
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:12,415
Fighting with these nails sir.

830
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:17,892
Now you are, but soon these spikes
will be your best friends.

831
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:23,930
Sir, can't we run
barefoot in the Olympics?

832
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:25,335
Don't be..

833
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:26,463
Come with me.

834
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:38,216
Run and show me.

835
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:45,313
Come back.

836
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:35,128
Easy... easy...

837
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:39,035
Why are you hiding their names?

838
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:41,771
Who were they?

839
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:45,804
Tell me their names
once and I will...

840
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:49,345
Looks like we'll need to admit him
in the hospital tomorrow.

841
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:52,718
All his efforts gone to waste.

842
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:00,724
Male no.1 Makhan Singh.

843
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:03,985
Male no.2 Albert D'Costa.

844
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,425
Male no.3 Shersingh Rana.

845
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:11,297
Male no.4 Kartar Singh.

846
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:15,297
Male no.5 Milkha Singh.

847
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:17,867
Male no.5 Milkha Singh.

848
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:19,606
Yes, sir.
- Oh, God.

849
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:30,412
Have you gone mad?

850
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:32,214
Let it be.

851
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:34,857
Milkha.

852
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:37,885
Sit down.

853
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:41,923
Sit down.

854
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:48,465
Listen carefully...

855
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:50,574
you'll get more chances.

856
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:54,507
If you run now,
you could damage your legs forever.

857
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:56,341
Understood.

858
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:05,418
Gurudev, make him see sense.

859
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:10,028
Don't be stubborn...

860
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:11,323
forget it.

861
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:14,992
What are you doing?

862
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:17,594
Your feet are swollen!

863
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:22,999
Give it a rest now.

864
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:24,507
Let me run.

865
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,812
You know what this means to me...

866
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:19,655
O Lord, keep my honour.

867
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:22,600
On your marks.

868
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:25,560
Set.

869
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:50,320
The name of Nanak
is like a ship...

870
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:58,586
...which will save you
in troubled waters

871
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:08,733
The ones who have
Nanak's name in their hearts,

872
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:20,576
Nanak makes them
cross the ocean of life

873
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:32,726
Nanak makes them
cross the ocean of life

874
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:56,846
Well done!

875
01:31:57,745 --> 01:31:59,918
Are you all right?

876
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:02,292
Are you all right?

877
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,457
Well done.

878
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:09,527
Are you all right?

879
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:15,834
Milkha, you broke
the national record.

880
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:26,646
You crazy fellow...

881
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:32,953
you've broken
the national record.

882
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:39,024
Guruji.

883
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:47,501
Milkha has become India!

884
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:57,247
Milk and turmeric
powder heals wounds fast.

885
01:32:57,672 --> 01:32:59,811
Who is Milkha Singh?

886
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:01,409
I am.

887
01:33:02,777 --> 01:33:04,654
I need your measurements
for the blazer.

888
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:12,623
Come in.

889
01:33:21,062 --> 01:33:23,008
Length, 28 inches.

890
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:33,117
Chest, 38 inches.

891
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:39,456
During the measurement
Milkha looked as shy...

892
01:33:41,315 --> 01:33:43,488
as a new bride getting
her wedding gown stitched.

893
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:45,420
Shoulder, 18 inches.

894
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,030
Arms, 28 inches.

895
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:54,033
Waist, 28 inches.

896
01:33:56,897 --> 01:34:00,037
Wrist, 10 inches.

897
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:08,615
Jassi.

898
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:28,396
Yes?

899
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:40,641
Milkha.

900
01:34:59,593 --> 01:35:01,573
Milkha!

901
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:12,281
I am your Milkhu.

902
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:14,417
I am not a ghost.

903
01:35:14,475 --> 01:35:15,476
No!

904
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:27,832
Why wear a coat in this heat?

905
01:35:28,589 --> 01:35:31,035
This isn't any coat, it's a blazer.

906
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:33,334
The Indian team blazer. Look!

907
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:37,534
Your brother has
worked very hard for it.

908
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:40,943
Here, you wear it.

909
01:35:41,802 --> 01:35:43,179
I'll look silly in a coat.

910
01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:44,781
Not me.

911
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:45,942
Try m

912
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,948
Put it on.

913
01:35:53,814 --> 01:35:55,088
All this fuss for a coat.

914
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:58,027
It looks so good on you.

915
01:35:59,553 --> 01:36:01,863
Now put your hands in the pockets.

916
01:36:03,357 --> 01:36:04,358
Like this.

917
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:33,024
Sister, stop crying.

918
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:38,292
Do you want to flood
the Chenab river?

919
01:37:07,621 --> 01:37:14,300
O dyer of my soul

920
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:23,081
O dyer of my soul in
the river of your colour

921
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:30,588
O dyer of my soul in the
river of your colour

922
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:35,619
I want to be immersed

923
01:37:38,419 --> 01:37:44,028
I don't want a
separate identity from yours

924
01:37:45,759 --> 01:37:53,302
A single breath I will
not take separate from you

925
01:37:53,500 --> 01:38:01,043
A single breath I will not
take separate from you

926
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:06,324
Let my soul be torn from my body

927
01:38:08,582 --> 01:38:14,828
I don't want a
separate identity from yours

928
01:38:15,489 --> 01:38:19,198
Dye me in your colour

929
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:23,037
Gently let the colour seep in

930
01:38:23,097 --> 01:38:26,874
Let rain soaked colour drench me

931
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:33,085
Make me your own,
make me your own

932
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:08,250
Crafted like an ornament

933
01:39:08,342 --> 01:39:10,583
I want to wear you my love

934
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:15,958
Come to my lips let me sing you

935
01:39:16,016 --> 01:39:17,962
Be my only song

936
01:39:17,985 --> 01:39:22,798
Grind away my anguish

937
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:27,838
Dissolve into me

938
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:31,672
Melt into me

939
01:39:31,732 --> 01:39:34,008
Make me your own

940
01:39:35,502 --> 01:39:39,177
Dye me in your colour

941
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:43,049
Gently let the colour seep in

942
01:39:43,143 --> 01:39:46,920
Let rain soaked colour drench me

943
01:39:47,181 --> 01:39:52,426
Make me your own,
make me your own

944
01:39:54,588 --> 01:39:58,331
Dye me in your colour

945
01:39:58,392 --> 01:40:02,033
Gently let the colour seep in

946
01:40:02,129 --> 01:40:05,941
Let rain soaked colour drench me

947
01:40:06,266 --> 01:40:11,306
Make me your own,
make me your own

948
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:38,967
Who has come to take me away?

949
01:40:40,134 --> 01:40:41,477
Who is my Romeo?

950
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:46,910
Who are you?

951
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:48,612
Who are you?

952
01:41:04,591 --> 01:41:06,127
I knew I'd find you here.

953
01:41:06,293 --> 01:41:07,465
Give me a hug!

954
01:41:08,862 --> 01:41:10,000
How are you?

955
01:41:10,264 --> 01:41:11,607
See for yourself.

956
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,345
Meeru, someone else live here now.

957
01:41:17,304 --> 01:41:18,612
Where is she?

958
01:41:19,673 --> 01:41:21,778
You look Smart.

959
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:23,352
The others will be thrilled.

960
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:26,016
I am asking about Biro
and you are rambling on.

961
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:29,557
Come let's meet the gang.

962
01:41:31,385 --> 01:41:32,386
Hey, stop it.

963
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:34,461
What has happened to her?

964
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:37,258
They don't live here anymore.

965
01:41:37,558 --> 01:41:38,662
Where do they?

966
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:40,530
Don't know.

967
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:44,708
Come out with it now.

968
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:46,570
What happened?

969
01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:49,846
She was married off.

970
01:42:04,852 --> 01:42:06,422
All this was happening
and you didn't tell me?

971
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:07,624
What could I tell you?

972
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:09,198
And what if I had told you?

973
01:42:09,389 --> 01:42:14,361
Would you have dropped everything
and come? It was too late.

974
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:16,803
She said she'd wait for me.

975
01:42:18,165 --> 01:42:19,667
Didn't Biro protest?

976
01:42:20,434 --> 01:42:23,415
She did and was thrashed for it.

977
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:26,648
Who cares what women want?

978
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:30,713
I have to meet her.
Who did she marry?

979
01:42:31,311 --> 01:42:32,915
What difference does it make?

980
01:42:34,014 --> 01:42:35,254
It does damn it!

981
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:37,739
A single breath I will not
take separate from you

982
01:43:45,085 --> 01:43:51,661
Let my soul be torn from my body

983
01:43:55,262 --> 01:44:02,737
I don't want a
separate identity from yours

984
01:44:07,107 --> 01:44:08,984
I can't do it without you.

985
01:44:09,376 --> 01:44:12,448
Crazy fellow! Of course you can!

986
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:15,051
Everything will be fine.

987
01:44:16,016 --> 01:44:18,690
Ranvir Singh is a great coach.

988
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:29,335
I'm losing everyone.

989
01:44:31,865 --> 01:44:33,003
Foolish boy!

990
01:44:34,134 --> 01:44:37,877
Birds that fly high up
don't get attached to small trees.

991
01:44:39,806 --> 01:44:42,218
The sky is the limit.

992
01:44:45,045 --> 01:44:49,892
You're off to Australia,
a foreign country.

993
01:44:50,651 --> 01:44:52,688
Come on! Give me a hug.

994
01:45:08,702 --> 01:45:09,737
Hey Milkha.

995
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:14,246
Our seats are together.

996
01:45:15,242 --> 01:45:18,052
Mahinder,
how does one tie this belt?

997
01:45:19,246 --> 01:45:23,558
Tie it the way you tie pajamas.

998
01:45:24,451 --> 01:45:25,862
Like this. - Hello.

999
01:45:27,854 --> 01:45:28,855
Hello.

1000
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:31,097
Let me help you.

1001
01:45:40,233 --> 01:45:41,439
There you are.

1002
01:45:42,202 --> 01:45:43,681
When do we undo it?

1003
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:45,747
When the plane is in the air.

1004
01:45:55,582 --> 01:45:56,652
Who is she?

1005
01:45:57,918 --> 01:46:01,024
What sort of a champion are you?
You don't know Perizad?

1006
01:46:01,988 --> 01:46:04,400
She's a swimming champion.
A mermaid.

1007
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:07,566
Isn't she sweet?

1008
01:46:08,895 --> 01:46:11,102
I've heard she's tough with guys.
Doesn't stand fools.

1009
01:46:11,631 --> 01:46:12,905
We aren't fools...

1010
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:14,201
dumb either.

1011
01:46:14,568 --> 01:46:15,842
Then become so.

1012
01:46:20,307 --> 01:46:22,810
Hey, it's going to take off!

1013
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:26,752
The way you speed up
before a long jump, same thing.

1014
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:29,288
We're about to fly! Look!

1015
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:31,488
Shut up!

1016
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:36,032
O Lord, have mercy.

1017
01:46:40,627 --> 01:46:41,901
Something is wrong...

1018
01:46:43,497 --> 01:46:44,908
I can't see anything.

1019
01:46:45,866 --> 01:46:47,436
This isn't right...

1020
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:49,411
he's come too high up.

1021
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:51,615
Milkha, what's wrong?

1022
01:46:52,472 --> 01:46:55,009
Look clouds below us...

1023
01:46:56,176 --> 01:46:58,087
we're above the clouds.
- Yes.

1024
01:46:58,478 --> 01:46:59,889
I can't see a thing!

1025
01:47:01,381 --> 01:47:06,990
We'll crash!
Let's get out, come on!

1026
01:47:07,187 --> 01:47:08,097
Sit down.

1027
01:47:08,155 --> 01:47:09,156
Milkha, sit down.

1028
01:47:09,322 --> 01:47:10,300
Milkha, sit down.

1029
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:11,630
Sir, he's too high!

1030
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:13,093
We'll crash, sir!

1031
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:14,833
Sir, I can't see anything.

1032
01:47:15,362 --> 01:47:16,773
Excuse me. All fine?

1033
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:18,900
What happened?
Please take the seat.

1034
01:47:19,032 --> 01:47:20,010
What happened?

1035
01:47:20,033 --> 01:47:23,708
Look. We're too high up!
He'll crash the plane.

1036
01:47:24,538 --> 01:47:28,577
Don't worry. The plane flies
over the clouds. Please calm down.

1037
01:47:28,675 --> 01:47:29,881
Please take care of the boys.

1038
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:31,180
Who are you?

1039
01:47:31,578 --> 01:47:35,685
The captain. I fly the plane.

1040
01:47:36,683 --> 01:47:38,026
And you left the controls?

1041
01:47:38,084 --> 01:47:40,997
Don't worry, two of us fly a plane.

1042
01:47:41,121 --> 01:47:43,032
Please take care of them.
- Yes.

1043
01:47:43,223 --> 01:47:44,327
Everything okay?

1044
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:51,240
Remember, Mahinder

1045
01:47:52,098 --> 01:47:55,011
Nothing can harm
those whom God protects.

1046
01:48:58,532 --> 01:48:59,943
Look at those guys.

1047
01:49:06,306 --> 01:49:07,376
They're walking to us.

1048
01:49:07,474 --> 01:49:08,475
Talk to them.

1049
01:49:08,608 --> 01:49:09,609
Hi.

1050
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:11,111
Hello.

1051
01:49:11,411 --> 01:49:12,754
You guys from India?

1052
01:49:14,848 --> 01:49:15,952
Yes, India.

1053
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:18,420
I like the way you do your hair.

1054
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:23,899
Boys, come here. -Yes, sir.

1055
01:49:29,996 --> 01:49:32,033
Mr. Peter Hamilton.

1056
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:34,603
Our technical advisor.

1057
01:49:34,968 --> 01:49:38,848
A champion in his day.

1058
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:40,407
All yours.

1059
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:44,211
Ranvir, what's this about?

1060
01:49:44,678 --> 01:49:47,716
That's the Indian way
of respecting coaches.

1061
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:50,488
Why don't you get them
rounded up to my place.

1062
01:49:52,686 --> 01:49:55,189
Don't take that trouble, Mr.
Hamilton.

1063
01:49:55,322 --> 01:49:56,733
It's no problem at all.

1064
01:49:57,157 --> 01:50:00,036
It'll give the boys a chance to loosen
up a bit. Get to know each other.

1065
01:50:02,495 --> 01:50:03,496
Okay then.

1066
01:50:06,466 --> 01:50:09,242
Peter, you've beautiful
set of pictures here.

1067
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:12,383
They are wonderful.
- Thanks, Ranvir.

1068
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:15,213
That one there, is my favorite.

1069
01:50:16,509 --> 01:50:19,854
Jesse Youngs. Brightest.

1070
01:50:22,315 --> 01:50:23,794
The champion of champions...

1071
01:50:24,217 --> 01:50:25,423
a brilliant athlete.

1072
01:50:29,556 --> 01:50:31,763
Hey, granddad. We're going out.

1073
01:50:31,825 --> 01:50:34,863
See you in the morning. - Stella.
Before you do, just come here.

1074
01:50:38,865 --> 01:50:42,039
Because I want to introduce you
to the Indian track running team.

1075
01:50:42,068 --> 01:50:43,979
That's the coach, Ranvir Singh.

1076
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:47,216
This is my beautiful
granddaughter, Stella.

1077
01:50:47,607 --> 01:50:49,985
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1078
01:50:50,377 --> 01:50:52,118
Welcome to Melbourne.
- Thank you.

1079
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:54,417
These are my friends. This
is Lindsy and Jane.

1080
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:56,192
Hi. - Hello.

1081
01:50:59,285 --> 01:51:01,526
So, you had a big day.
You relaxing?

1082
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:05,595
No, I'm Milkha Singh. 400mts.

1083
01:51:09,562 --> 01:51:11,007
You dumb fool...

1084
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:14,479
she's asking how you are?
Not your name.

1085
01:51:16,903 --> 01:51:21,352
Yes, relaxing. Boys are
relaxing fine. - Okay, good.

1086
01:51:25,578 --> 01:51:28,457
Granddad, do you think it would be
okay if the boys came out with us?

1087
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:32,919
Would you like to come with us?
There's dancing, and music.

1088
01:51:38,591 --> 01:51:39,797
You think so?

1089
01:51:42,262 --> 01:51:43,673
Go see the city...

1090
01:51:44,197 --> 01:51:45,267
...Take a look around...

1091
01:51:45,398 --> 01:51:46,433
make friends.

1092
01:51:46,533 --> 01:51:47,534
Yes, sir.

1093
01:51:48,068 --> 01:51:51,743
But don't be late
for practice tomorrow.

1094
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:53,540
Yes, sir.

1095
01:51:54,174 --> 01:51:56,484
But don't be late for
practice tomorrow.

1096
01:51:56,609 --> 01:51:58,282
Don't be late.

1097
01:51:58,745 --> 01:52:00,053
No, don't be late.

1098
01:52:02,849 --> 01:52:03,850
Thank you.

1099
01:52:23,903 --> 01:52:25,211
Gentlemen, beer.

1100
01:52:29,209 --> 01:52:31,689
What is this?
- No, no, beer.

1101
01:52:32,679 --> 01:52:33,680
No beer.

1102
01:52:35,515 --> 01:52:36,516
Cheers.

1103
01:53:20,326 --> 01:53:27,642

You've intoxicated me so

Don't stop me, restrain me

1109
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:51,761
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1110
01:53:52,592 --> 01:53:55,664
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1111
01:54:28,595 --> 01:54:32,168
In the darkness of the
night the hands go astray

1112
01:54:32,632 --> 01:54:38,913
The lips start to lie
and morals start to loosen

1113
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:45,953
When you descend into the ocean,
the water beams crimson

1114
01:54:48,348 --> 01:54:52,160
When you descend into the
ocean, the water beams crimson

1115
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:56,089
The waves become tipsy,
and the fish too are drunk

1116
01:54:56,155 --> 01:54:59,830
You, my whiskey, my hooch

1117
01:55:00,026 --> 01:55:03,838
You've intoxicated me so

1118
01:55:03,997 --> 01:55:08,537
Don't stop me, restrain me not,
let me drink like a king

1119
01:55:08,635 --> 01:55:11,878
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1120
01:55:12,572 --> 01:55:15,610
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1121
01:55:16,609 --> 01:55:19,681
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1122
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:23,618
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1123
01:55:24,617 --> 01:55:27,621
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1124
01:55:28,621 --> 01:55:31,727
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1125
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:56,754
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1126
01:56:15,101 --> 01:56:16,205
Who's there?

1127
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,521
Oh! The wrong key.

1128
01:58:29,635 --> 01:58:31,205
Wakey-wakey!

1129
01:58:36,242 --> 01:58:37,243
No beer.

1130
01:59:17,984 --> 01:59:18,985
Sorry, sir.

1131
01:59:28,761 --> 01:59:32,140
You're never late. What's going on?

1132
01:59:35,034 --> 01:59:36,035
Answer me.

1133
01:59:36,669 --> 01:59:38,342
I had some beer last night, sir.

1134
01:59:39,839 --> 01:59:41,978
You came here to drink beer?
- No, sir.

1135
01:59:42,375 --> 01:59:43,649
Why did you come here?

1136
01:59:45,478 --> 01:59:46,582
To run, sir.

1137
01:59:47,246 --> 01:59:49,749
You have a qualifying
race in 4 days.

1138
01:59:51,083 --> 01:59:52,756
If you don't qualify...

1139
01:59:53,653 --> 01:59:54,893
you're out.

1140
01:59:56,022 --> 01:59:57,057
Look at me!

1141
01:59:59,225 --> 02:00:00,226
Milkha Singh.

1142
02:00:01,093 --> 02:00:03,505
To be a sportsman,
you have to be determined...

1143
02:00:05,331 --> 02:00:08,141
disciplined and dedicated.

1144
02:00:09,268 --> 02:00:10,303
Sorry, sir.

1145
02:00:11,304 --> 02:00:12,374
Go warm up.

1146
02:00:13,839 --> 02:00:14,840
Yes, sir.

1147
02:00:18,344 --> 02:00:20,722
Did you score?

1148
02:00:21,814 --> 02:00:22,815
No.

1149
02:00:22,915 --> 02:00:24,258
Tell me.
- Hey, Singh!

1150
02:00:29,789 --> 02:00:30,961
I'll see you later.

1151
02:01:02,855 --> 02:01:06,029
You're as delicate as glass

1152
02:01:13,065 --> 02:01:14,635
Breathe lightly

1153
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:19,049
God forbid you shatter
when you strain to turn

1154
02:01:23,075 --> 02:01:26,522
You need me so let
me carry you away

1155
02:01:27,079 --> 02:01:30,526
Walking gently,
I'll turn into a habit

1156
02:01:30,616 --> 02:01:34,359
You, my whiskey, my hooch

1157
02:01:34,587 --> 02:01:38,364
You've intoxicated me so

1158
02:01:38,491 --> 02:01:43,099
Don't stop me, restrain me
not, let me drink like a king

1159
02:04:14,313 --> 02:04:16,691
Hey, Singh.

1160
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:18,622
I am so sorry.

1161
02:04:19,351 --> 02:04:21,888
You need to go easy on
yourself, it's so tough out there.

1162
02:04:23,989 --> 02:04:24,990
Hey.

1163
02:04:27,493 --> 02:04:29,097
You're not blaming me,
are you?

1164
02:04:31,230 --> 02:04:32,265
Are you?

1165
02:06:04,657 --> 02:06:05,829
Sorry, Stella.

1166
02:06:09,161 --> 02:06:11,869
You're not the problem.

1167
02:06:14,066 --> 02:06:15,067
I'm the problem.

1168
02:06:39,491 --> 02:06:41,493
I'm really going to miss you.

1169
02:06:43,696 --> 02:06:44,697
Sorry.

1170
02:07:12,291 --> 02:07:13,292
Sir.

1171
02:07:20,633 --> 02:07:22,840
What is the 400m world record, sir?

1172
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:43,926
The world is lashing out at you

1173
02:08:44,016 --> 02:08:45,825
Welcome the battle cry

1174
02:08:45,918 --> 02:08:47,659
Your arms are like oars

1175
02:08:47,753 --> 02:08:50,427
Feet that raise an uproar

1176
02:08:51,223 --> 02:08:52,827
Your every vein is iron ore

1177
02:08:52,925 --> 02:08:55,496
You are fire Milkha

1178
02:08:56,328 --> 02:08:58,535
Now you run Milkha

1179
02:09:00,165 --> 02:09:06,844
Now you run Milkha, run Milkha,
run run run run run Milkha

1180
02:09:07,806 --> 02:09:09,843
Let go the baggage of yesterday

1181
02:09:09,942 --> 02:09:11,683
Cut the ropes and
leashes that bind you

1182
02:09:11,744 --> 02:09:13,724
This earth shall question you

1183
02:09:14,947 --> 02:09:16,722
Each breath like
fire from the kiln

1184
02:09:16,782 --> 02:09:19,319
Now awaken Milkha

1185
02:09:19,518 --> 02:09:22,431
Now you run Milkha

1186
02:09:25,624 --> 02:09:29,470
O rod of steel

1187
02:09:31,163 --> 02:09:35,509
O boat

1188
02:09:36,468 --> 02:09:38,243
O rod of steel

1189
02:09:38,337 --> 02:09:40,283
Turn around the tides of fire

1190
02:09:40,339 --> 02:09:41,977
O boat

1191
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:44,850
Your glory lies in sinking

1192
02:09:45,711 --> 02:09:47,657
o ju"9le, O jungle

1193
02:09:48,013 --> 02:09:51,017
Today you will take on the cities

1194
02:09:51,083 --> 02:09:53,791
Now you run Milkha

1195
02:10:30,088 --> 02:10:31,328
Milkha, get up!

1196
02:10:33,492 --> 02:10:34,937
Did you hear what I said?

1197
02:10:36,295 --> 02:10:37,296
Get up.

1198
02:10:47,239 --> 02:10:48,616
The world record is broken.

1199
02:10:49,875 --> 02:10:51,946
Milkha Singh has
broken the world record!

1200
02:10:52,644 --> 02:10:54,988
Everyone is cheering... hear them?

1201
02:10:59,518 --> 02:11:01,020
I want that paper back!

1202
02:11:01,553 --> 02:11:03,226
I want that paper back!

1203
02:11:13,398 --> 02:11:17,710
Throw off all your
cares and troubles

1204
02:11:18,837 --> 02:11:22,876
The skeletons of the past

1205
02:11:24,443 --> 02:11:28,653
The soles of your feet
are like horse shoes

1206
02:11:30,015 --> 02:11:34,191
You've got to do it come what may

1207
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:38,397
Yes. Come on, move.

1208
02:11:41,126 --> 02:11:42,833
Move, Milkha.

1209
02:11:47,199 --> 02:11:50,874
Tear open the wheels of that chariot
Turn it into the divine disc

1210
02:11:50,969 --> 02:11:52,710
Bind well the laces of war

1211
02:11:52,871 --> 02:11:57,320
The lion has emerged
from his lair

1212
02:11:57,776 --> 02:12:01,246
Fire the bullet Milkha

1213
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:03,790
Now you must run Milkha

1214
02:13:01,406 --> 02:13:02,407
It killed me.

1215
02:13:03,542 --> 02:13:04,850
But I enjoyed it!

1216
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:22,734
Sir, what is this?

1217
02:13:24,563 --> 02:13:25,667
Put them on.

1218
02:13:32,371 --> 02:13:34,351
They're heavy.
- Tie them up.

1219
02:13:53,925 --> 02:13:55,063
I can't lift my feet, sir.

1220
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:58,332
Never mind...
you'll enjoy this even more.

1221
02:14:30,996 --> 02:14:37,572
Now you must rise Milkha

1222
02:14:38,303 --> 02:14:44,811
You are fire Milkha

1223
02:14:45,911 --> 02:14:52,419
Now you must rise Milkha

1224
02:14:53,085 --> 02:14:59,730
You are fire Milkha

1225
02:15:04,563 --> 02:15:07,772
O rod of steel

1226
02:15:10,302 --> 02:15:16,412
O boat

1227
02:15:20,579 --> 02:15:22,456
The field is your cradle

1228
02:15:22,514 --> 02:15:24,187
Cover it with your splendour

1229
02:15:24,349 --> 02:15:26,090
The mountains are at your head

1230
02:15:26,184 --> 02:15:29,825
Drape the entire sky

1231
02:15:29,888 --> 02:15:34,234
Tie the turban of resolve Milkha

1232
02:15:35,727 --> 02:15:40,005
Now you must run Milkha

1233
02:15:41,333 --> 02:15:47,716
Now you must rise Milkha

1234
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:53,685
You are fire Milkha

1235
02:17:41,052 --> 02:17:45,057
Sorry, please forgive me.

1236
02:17:46,424 --> 02:17:47,698
I am not insulting you...

1237
02:17:49,361 --> 02:17:50,863
this is a fight with myself.

1238
02:18:27,966 --> 02:18:33,177
O Lord! May I die on my feet,
not on my knees.

1239
02:19:25,490 --> 02:19:30,303
Abdul Khaliq was Pakistan's pride.

1240
02:19:31,162 --> 02:19:32,835
The fastest runner in Asia.

1241
02:19:35,367 --> 02:19:38,143
Milkha couldn't
wait to see him run.

1242
02:19:38,570 --> 02:19:42,347
The next day he was
to run against him.

1243
02:20:27,652 --> 02:20:32,431
I'm grateful to
my countrymen and to Coach Javed.

1244
02:20:33,324 --> 02:20:35,133
Salaam!
- Thanks.

1245
02:20:37,061 --> 02:20:38,062
Javed sir.

1246
02:20:39,297 --> 02:20:40,867
Your boy ran well.

1247
02:20:41,466 --> 02:20:43,207
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1248
02:20:43,701 --> 02:20:45,271
Bravo! You ruled the field.

1249
02:20:45,737 --> 02:20:46,772
Thank you, sir.

1250
02:20:47,105 --> 02:20:48,243
This is Milkha Singh.

1251
02:20:48,606 --> 02:20:51,086
India's 400m champion athlete.

1252
02:20:52,143 --> 02:20:53,213
Hello, sir.

1253
02:20:53,678 --> 02:20:56,818
You're competing in the 200m race.

1254
02:20:58,650 --> 02:20:59,720
All the best.

1255
02:21:00,051 --> 02:21:01,029
To you too.

1256
02:21:01,553 --> 02:21:02,896
Watch out.

1257
02:21:03,721 --> 02:21:05,530
Watch out, Khaliq.

1258
02:21:06,891 --> 02:21:09,201
I hear you ran
away from Pakistan...

1259
02:21:12,163 --> 02:21:14,109
have been running
ever since, huh?

1260
02:21:16,501 --> 02:21:19,243
Now you need to show
your magic in 200m as well.

1261
02:21:20,638 --> 02:21:21,639
Come.

1262
02:21:21,873 --> 02:21:23,875
We've seen dozens like Milkha.

1263
02:21:25,810 --> 02:21:28,188
We have two choices...

1264
02:21:29,047 --> 02:21:32,494
leave our village
and go to the new India.

1265
02:21:34,018 --> 02:21:37,329
Or change our religion as they ask.

1266
02:21:37,388 --> 02:21:38,799
We shall not eat cow's meat!

1267
02:21:39,090 --> 02:21:42,560
They can behead us, but we
will never change our religion!

1268
02:21:44,863 --> 02:21:48,276
Prepare to fight then.

1269
02:21:49,501 --> 02:21:54,473
When Guru Govind Singh
left Anantpur Sahib...

1270
02:21:55,173 --> 02:21:57,210
and reached Garhwal fort...

1271
02:21:57,675 --> 02:22:00,053
. he had only 40 Sikhs with him.

1272
02:22:00,478 --> 02:22:03,459
While the enemy were a million!

1273
02:22:05,016 --> 02:22:08,759
Guruji dressed
his sons in armour...

1274
02:22:08,853 --> 02:22:10,628
...and sent them to battle.

1275
02:22:11,589 --> 02:22:13,660
His forty men fought hard.

1276
02:22:15,226 --> 02:22:18,173
They fought a mighty army.

1277
02:22:18,596 --> 02:22:21,042
How will we fight?

1278
02:22:22,634 --> 02:22:25,843
They have weapons, horses...

1279
02:22:27,238 --> 02:22:28,239
And us?

1280
02:22:29,607 --> 02:22:30,950
What do we have?

1281
02:22:33,845 --> 02:22:35,347
Enough of bravado!

1282
02:22:36,247 --> 02:22:37,851
Thousands are leaving for India...

1283
02:22:38,182 --> 02:22:40,184
we should go too.

1284
02:22:47,692 --> 02:22:49,797
A sparrow will challenge an eagle,

1285
02:22:53,398 --> 02:22:55,605
A sparrow will challenge an eagle,

1286
02:22:56,901 --> 02:22:58,903
A lamb will fight a lion,

1287
02:23:00,038 --> 02:23:03,019
One man will fight a million.

1288
02:23:03,841 --> 02:23:07,311
Guru Govind Singh, bless us!

1289
02:23:09,714 --> 02:23:12,160
A sparrow will challenge an eagle,

1290
02:23:12,317 --> 02:23:14,524
A lamb will fight a lion,

1291
02:23:14,752 --> 02:23:16,891
One man will fight a million.

1292
02:23:17,021 --> 02:23:19,160
Guru Govind Singh, bless us!

1293
02:24:13,611 --> 02:24:14,885
Come on.

1294
02:24:30,795 --> 02:24:33,002
Milkha. Are you alright, son?

1295
02:27:33,978 --> 02:27:34,979
Jai Hind sir.

1296
02:27:35,279 --> 02:27:37,520
Today, you won't
salute us, we salute you.

1297
02:27:38,482 --> 02:27:39,984
The whole unit salutes you.

1298
02:27:40,918 --> 02:27:42,022
India salutes you.

1299
02:27:43,387 --> 02:27:44,388
Proud.

1300
02:27:49,627 --> 02:27:54,906
Milkha, you are an officer now.

1301
02:28:01,372 --> 02:28:02,373
No.

1302
02:28:14,619 --> 02:28:18,726
All because of the pat on my back
and a kick on my butt from you sir.

1303
02:28:24,095 --> 02:28:25,233
Stay well, my son.

1304
02:28:26,297 --> 02:28:28,277
I wish you a thousand joys.

1305
02:28:35,206 --> 02:28:36,446
You have made me happy.

1306
02:28:38,709 --> 02:28:42,054
Congratulations to his friends!

1307
02:28:46,584 --> 02:28:50,657
Many many congratulation
for Milkhas winning.

1308
02:28:50,922 --> 02:28:54,028
Let's celebrate!

1309
02:30:01,125 --> 02:30:06,598
Bite through the electric fire

1310
02:30:07,365 --> 02:30:13,043
Chew the metal's
vibrating current

1311
02:30:13,237 --> 02:30:17,708
Set aflame your every pore

1312
02:30:18,009 --> 02:30:23,118
Without burning yourself
there's no glow

1313
02:30:56,147 --> 02:30:59,856
The flames are burning Milkha

1314
02:31:00,051 --> 02:31:03,430
Run Milkha

1315
02:31:03,654 --> 02:31:07,761
Run Milkha

1316
02:31:38,956 --> 02:31:40,958
Excuse me.
Can I have a photograph please?

1317
02:31:41,092 --> 02:31:42,093
Of course.

1318
02:31:43,828 --> 02:31:44,829
Thank you.

1319
02:31:46,964 --> 02:31:51,242
Son, you have made us proud.

1320
02:31:52,169 --> 02:31:54,615
Now make India's flag
flutter high at the Rome Olympics.

1321
02:31:54,839 --> 02:31:58,150
The hopes of all India ride on you.

1322
02:31:59,143 --> 02:32:02,420
I will run like
my life depends on it.

1323
02:32:03,481 --> 02:32:05,119
Wonderful.

1324
02:32:05,516 --> 02:32:09,225
Son, what can we do for you?

1325
02:32:12,356 --> 02:32:17,567
Panditji, if I win, can you
declare a national holiday?

1326
02:32:19,029 --> 02:32:20,269
Of course.

1327
02:32:23,701 --> 02:32:25,578
A call from Pakistan.

1328
02:32:26,537 --> 02:32:28,676
Gentlemen. Excuse me, please.
- Yes.

1329
02:32:34,745 --> 02:32:36,122
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1330
02:32:36,647 --> 02:32:38,923
An important announcement...

1331
02:32:39,483 --> 02:32:43,397
what a coincidence that
while you are all here and...

1332
02:32:44,388 --> 02:32:49,770
Pakistan's President,
Field Marshal Ayub Khan has called.

1333
02:32:51,028 --> 02:32:58,503
He has accepted my proposal
of the lndo-Pak friendship games.

1334
02:33:00,037 --> 02:33:03,280
It's an important step
toward friendship...

1335
02:33:04,408 --> 02:33:06,217
between our two nations.

1336
02:33:07,411 --> 02:33:08,412
I would like...

1337
02:33:09,213 --> 02:33:13,525
Milkha Singh to
lead our contingent...

1338
02:33:13,918 --> 02:33:15,226
to Pakistan.

1339
02:33:34,205 --> 02:33:35,684
All eyes were on Milkha.

1340
02:33:38,042 --> 02:33:40,648
But there was a storm
brewing in Milkha's head.

1341
02:35:19,243 --> 02:35:27,185
Milkha, run!

1342
02:35:28,619 --> 02:35:30,064
Run!

1343
02:35:31,355 --> 02:35:33,266
Why are you standing here?

1344
02:35:39,163 --> 02:35:41,040
Son. Son.

1345
02:35:41,565 --> 02:35:43,943
Listen to me...

1346
02:35:48,472 --> 02:35:50,452
don't be scared.

1347
02:35:52,042 --> 02:35:53,487
No harm will come to you.

1348
02:35:54,311 --> 02:35:57,292
Don't be scared.

1349
02:35:57,848 --> 02:35:59,657
Son, be brave.

1350
02:36:00,617 --> 02:36:02,062
You'll be fine.

1351
02:36:04,321 --> 02:36:07,131
Run, Milkha! Run!

1352
02:36:07,324 --> 02:36:08,632
Get out of here.

1353
02:36:11,362 --> 02:36:20,749
Run, Milkha! Run!

1354
02:36:22,439 --> 02:36:24,646
Don't turn back to look!

1355
02:37:02,045 --> 02:37:07,654
So, Pakistan is a
terrible memory for Milkha...

1356
02:37:08,485 --> 02:37:12,456
and we have come to
revive those memories.

1357
02:37:21,298 --> 02:37:26,873
We have reached Chandigarh.

1358
02:37:29,173 --> 02:37:30,652
We've reached.

1359
02:37:31,241 --> 02:37:33,118
But what shall we say to Milkha?

1360
02:37:37,481 --> 02:37:39,324
You have a nice garden.

1361
02:37:40,150 --> 02:37:43,654
It seems gardening interests you.

1362
02:37:44,655 --> 02:37:45,656
Seems so.

1363
02:37:52,563 --> 02:37:59,344
It has suddenly turned cold
in Chandigarh hasn't it?

1364
02:37:59,903 --> 02:38:01,007
You're right.

1365
02:38:09,446 --> 02:38:10,447
Thank you.

1366
02:38:23,694 --> 02:38:25,833
Sir, sugar?
- One spoon.

1367
02:38:30,501 --> 02:38:31,502
Thank you.

1368
02:38:39,977 --> 02:38:44,323
So much sugar, Milkha?

1369
02:38:46,016 --> 02:38:47,086
It's not good for you.

1370
02:38:48,318 --> 02:38:50,355
Oh! That's mine...

1371
02:38:53,123 --> 02:38:56,798
You aren't here to discuss
the weather and sugar.

1372
02:39:00,364 --> 02:39:05,177
Milkha, Nehruji wants to meet you.

1373
02:39:13,277 --> 02:39:14,449
I can't do it sir.

1374
02:39:16,647 --> 02:39:18,354
My feet won't move.

1375
02:39:20,884 --> 02:39:23,728
My family's blood is in that air,
I won't be able to breathe.

1376
02:39:28,058 --> 02:39:29,059
Son...

1377
02:39:32,129 --> 02:39:36,703
You're a soldier.
Your country needs you now.

1378
02:39:38,001 --> 02:39:40,277
If you must wage war
with your own self for it...

1379
02:39:42,472 --> 02:39:43,746
then you should.

1380
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:49,203
Right now, it's important.

1381
02:41:49,833 --> 02:41:52,905
Peace and harmony must
prevail between our countries.

1382
02:41:53,270 --> 02:41:57,810
Sports are an important
means to that goal.

1383
02:41:57,874 --> 02:41:59,319
That's all very well, sir...

1384
02:41:59,543 --> 02:42:02,114
but why won't Milkha
Singh meet the press?

1385
02:42:04,081 --> 02:42:06,357
What's the problem?

1386
02:42:06,450 --> 02:42:08,987
Did he rebuff Khaliq's challenge?

1387
02:42:11,054 --> 02:42:12,727
Why the empty chair?

1388
02:42:13,356 --> 02:42:18,203
He knows coming to Pakistan...

1389
02:42:19,529 --> 02:42:21,031
is a mistake.

1390
02:42:22,265 --> 02:42:26,077
Mr. Khaliq, can you defeat him?

1391
02:42:26,470 --> 02:42:27,471
God willing

1392
02:42:31,007 --> 02:42:34,284
But where is Milkha Singh?

1393
02:42:35,846 --> 02:42:40,352
Everyone, please sit down!

1394
02:44:26,256 --> 02:44:27,257
Mother!

1395
02:44:36,166 --> 02:44:37,167
Mother!

1396
02:44:45,742 --> 02:44:46,743
Mother!

1397
02:44:57,554 --> 02:44:58,555
Mother!

1398
02:45:13,103 --> 02:45:14,104
Mother!

1399
02:45:15,906 --> 02:45:16,907
Mother!

1400
02:45:19,776 --> 02:45:20,777
Mother!

1401
02:45:24,848 --> 02:45:25,849
Mother!

1402
02:45:59,316 --> 02:46:02,092
Mother!

1403
02:46:33,984 --> 02:46:35,019
Mother!

1404
02:47:10,086 --> 02:47:11,087
Mother!

1405
02:47:50,093 --> 02:47:51,504
Why are you crying?

1406
02:47:52,562 --> 02:47:54,667
Crying is no good.

1407
02:47:54,898 --> 02:47:56,070
Don't cry.

1408
02:48:01,004 --> 02:48:03,450
Your photo...

1409
02:48:19,789 --> 02:48:20,893
Is this you?

1410
02:48:23,226 --> 02:48:25,263
Red is the maiden's veil...

1411
02:48:32,535 --> 02:48:34,515
Red are tomatoes...

1412
02:48:41,444 --> 02:48:43,355
Red like Sampreefs butt!

1413
02:48:45,815 --> 02:48:47,260
Milkha's butt.

1414
02:48:48,852 --> 02:48:49,853
Sampreet!

1415
02:48:51,521 --> 02:48:52,898
Milkha.

1416
02:48:58,828 --> 02:49:00,535
I thought you were...

1417
02:49:00,830 --> 02:49:02,036
I Survived...

1418
02:49:03,133 --> 02:49:04,305
I Survived...

1419
02:49:10,106 --> 02:49:13,019
People aren't bad, Milkha. But
circumstances can make them bad.

1420
02:49:13,877 --> 02:49:17,256
Partition was a bad time.
Remember our Muslim teacher...

1421
02:49:17,580 --> 02:49:20,857
he raised me
and got me married.

1422
02:49:22,619 --> 02:49:23,620
Some milk?

1423
02:49:25,288 --> 02:49:28,292
You love it I'm told.
- Yes, sister-in-law.

1424
02:49:32,762 --> 02:49:36,369
Aren't you the Milkha
Singh who runs?

1425
02:49:42,372 --> 02:49:46,548
I am...

1426
02:49:50,413 --> 02:49:51,585
the one who runs.

1427
02:50:01,257 --> 02:50:03,362
The connections are done,
start the radio.

1428
02:50:08,331 --> 02:50:09,537
Hey, change the station.

1429
02:50:10,233 --> 02:50:11,303
Just a minute.

1430
02:50:13,803 --> 02:50:19,082
Just by looking at
the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore...

1431
02:50:19,375 --> 02:50:24,586
it seems as though
entire Pakistan has turned up...

1432
02:50:25,081 --> 02:50:30,690
in India everyone's
heart is beating faster.

1433
02:50:34,424 --> 02:50:38,429
We can see the planes
throwing colour in the skies...

1434
02:50:38,528 --> 02:50:42,408
and General Ayub
Khan of Pakistan...

1435
02:50:42,498 --> 02:50:46,412
is entering the stadium
in his magnificent cavalcade.

1436
02:51:01,451 --> 02:51:04,364
Your Excellency, good morning.
- Welcome to Pakistan.

1437
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:05,828
Thank you, sir.
- All the best.

1438
02:51:06,356 --> 02:51:08,358
Same to you, sir.
- Sir.

1439
02:51:11,828 --> 02:51:13,671
All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

1440
02:51:14,797 --> 02:51:16,299
Best of luck.
- Thank you, sir.

1441
02:51:17,500 --> 02:51:19,036
All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

1442
02:51:25,642 --> 02:51:28,919
All the best, Milkha Singh.
- Thank you, sir.

1443
02:51:30,546 --> 02:51:36,087
Khaliq.

1444
02:51:36,419 --> 02:51:39,059
Pakistan's hopes are riding on you.

1445
02:51:39,389 --> 02:51:41,869
I will do my best.

1446
02:51:42,825 --> 02:51:44,304
All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

1447
02:51:50,967 --> 02:51:53,038
And the tension is building.

1448
02:51:53,870 --> 02:51:58,080
It's as if everyone
is breathing together,

1449
02:51:58,775 --> 02:52:01,449
or rather everyone
has stopped breathing.

1450
02:52:10,053 --> 02:52:12,055
Leave them far behind you.

1451
02:52:13,489 --> 02:52:14,900
No one can defeat you.

1452
02:52:15,758 --> 02:52:17,396
No, Milkha.

1453
02:52:18,127 --> 02:52:21,472
You're the best. You're the champ.

1454
02:52:21,664 --> 02:52:23,473
Squad..

1455
02:52:23,700 --> 02:52:25,373
Go, my lion! Run!

1456
02:52:33,376 --> 02:52:34,377
Go, son.

1457
02:52:34,911 --> 02:52:35,912
Do it.

1458
02:52:37,013 --> 02:52:38,014
Yes.

1459
02:52:41,150 --> 02:52:42,288
Milkha Singh.

1460
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:46,964
This could be the last
race of your life.

1461
02:52:48,324 --> 02:52:49,598
That's how I'll run it.

1462
02:52:53,329 --> 02:52:55,832
On your mark.

1463
02:53:19,655 --> 02:53:21,191
There is absolute silence...

1464
02:53:21,758 --> 02:53:24,261
everyone's eyes
are on the race track.

1465
02:53:24,894 --> 02:53:26,066
Who will win?

1466
02:53:26,896 --> 02:53:29,570
India's hope Milkha Singh...

1467
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:38,384
or Pakistan's star athlete,
Asia's tornado, Abdul Khaliq.

1468
02:54:01,197 --> 02:54:02,767
Squad...

1469
02:54:07,703 --> 02:54:09,842
The gun is fired
and the race has begun.

1470
02:54:09,972 --> 02:54:13,317
Pakistan's Abdul Khaliq
is leading the pack...

1471
02:54:13,543 --> 02:54:15,784
looks as though he has decided
to come and win today.

1472
02:54:15,978 --> 02:54:19,551
He seems to be reaching
his goal effortlessly.

1473
02:54:19,749 --> 02:54:25,563
Without a care, without a worry,
he is running towards the finish line.

1474
02:54:25,855 --> 02:54:29,302
Looks like his feet
are about to kiss victory.

1475
02:54:29,425 --> 02:54:31,803
Come on.
- Come on, son.

1476
02:54:38,401 --> 02:54:41,143
But wait a minute!
Something else is happening here...

1477
02:54:41,204 --> 02:54:44,515
Milkha Singh is
suddenly catching up...

1478
02:54:44,574 --> 02:54:47,214
and one by one
he is leaving everyone behind!

1479
02:54:47,410 --> 02:54:52,587
And with such ease he has now
overtaken Pakistan's Abdul Khaliq!

1480
02:54:52,748 --> 02:54:57,959
This can only be called a miracle which
we may not ever get to witness again.

1481
02:55:09,031 --> 02:55:11,978
It seems as though
Milkha Singh has grown wings...

1482
02:55:12,001 --> 02:55:14,504
the wind is
carrying him forward...

1483
02:55:14,604 --> 02:55:16,606
or he is running
above the clouds.

1484
02:55:17,773 --> 02:55:18,808
Come on, Milkha.

1485
02:55:35,157 --> 02:55:41,301
Throw off all your
cares and troubles

1486
02:55:41,497 --> 02:55:47,743
The skeletons of the past

1487
02:55:48,070 --> 02:55:53,850
The soles of your
feet are like horse shoes

1488
02:55:54,143 --> 02:56:00,458
You've got to do it come what may

1489
02:56:09,959 --> 02:56:15,238
You are fire Milkha

1490
02:56:42,525 --> 02:56:45,165
Hail Mother India!

1491
02:56:54,437 --> 02:56:58,613
To celebrate Milkha Singh's
glorious victory in Pakistan...

1492
02:56:59,375 --> 02:57:03,380
I propose a public
holiday in this honour.

1493
02:57:04,046 --> 02:57:07,152
Milkha has planted the Indian flag!

1494
02:57:08,351 --> 02:57:11,855
He's done it!

1495
02:59:46,976 --> 02:59:52,824
No one has ever run
like you did today.

1496
02:59:53,883 --> 02:59:57,126
You didn't run my son, you flew.

1497
02:59:59,155 --> 03:00:01,601
From now on the world
will know you as...

1498
03:00:02,491 --> 03:00:05,165
'The Flying Sikh.'

1499
03:00:06,228 --> 03:00:09,004
Pakistan bestows
this title upon you...

1500
03:00:09,565 --> 03:00:11,010
with pride and honour.

1501
03:00:12,868 --> 03:00:15,474
Well done, my boy. Well done.

1502
03:00:51,073 --> 03:00:54,953
The world is lashing out at you.
Welcome the battle cry.

1503
03:00:55,077 --> 03:00:59,253
Your arms are like oars.
Feet that raise an uproar

1504
03:01:00,282 --> 03:01:03,820
Your every vein is iron ore.
You are fire Milkha.

1505
03:01:05,588 --> 03:01:09,536
Now you run Milkha

1506
03:01:11,026 --> 03:01:17,033
Now you run Milkha, run Milkha,
run run run run run Milkha

1507
03:01:22,705 --> 03:01:25,709
O rod of steel

1508
03:01:28,444 --> 03:01:33,826
O boat

1509
03:01:35,384 --> 03:01:39,059
O rod of steel.
Turn around the tides of fire

1510
03:01:39,088 --> 03:01:44,697
O boat,
Your glory lies in sinking

1511
03:01:51,800 --> 03:01:57,910
Now you run Milkha

1512
03:01:59,441 --> 03:02:05,119
Now you must rise Milkha

1513
03:02:06,515 --> 03:02:13,125
You are fire Milkha

1514
03:02:14,089 --> 03:02:19,801
Now awaken Milkha

1515
03:02:21,297 --> 03:02:27,145
You are fire Milkha

1516
03:02:32,474 --> 03:02:38,550
Now you must run Milkha

1517
03:02:39,581 --> 03:02:43,324
The field is your cradle.
Cover it with your splendour

1518
03:02:43,385 --> 03:02:45,126
The mountains are at your head

1519
03:02:45,254 --> 03:02:48,895
Drape the entire sky

1520
03:02:49,024 --> 03:02:52,437
Tie the turban of resolve Milkha

1521
03:02:54,763 --> 03:02:59,075
You are fire Milkha.

1522
03:03:02,338 --> 03:03:05,979
Tear open the wheels of that chariot.
Turn it into the divine disc.

1523
03:03:06,008 --> 03:03:10,286
Bind well the laces of war. The
lion has emerged from his lair

1524
03:03:10,980 --> 03:03:14,120
Fire the bullet Milkha

1525
03:03:18,754 --> 03:03:27,469
Now you must run Milkha

1526
03:03:29,732 --> 03:03:36,377
Now awaken Milkha

1527
03:03:44,513 --> 03:03:50,862
Now awaken Milkha

1528
03:03:51,720 --> 03:03:58,228
You are fire Milkha

1529
03:03:59,928 --> 03:04:04,502
Bite through the electric fire

1530
03:04:05,234 --> 03:04:08,738
Chew the metal's
vibrating current

1531
03:04:09,138 --> 03:04:12,517
Set aflame your every pore

1532
03:04:12,775 --> 03:04:16,689
Without burning
yourself there's no glow

1533
03:04:19,281 --> 03:04:22,660
The flames are burning Milkha

1534
03:04:47,409 --> 03:04:52,722
Now awaken Milkha

1535
03:04:54,483 --> 03:05:01,093
You are fire Milkha

1536
03:05:01,500 --> 03:06:25,100
