1
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:50,892
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa...

2
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:56,300
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa,

3
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,531
to be my lawfully wedded wife.

4
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:01,039
I do. I do.

5
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,235
Hey, Lois.
The room looks beautiful.

6
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:08,440
Oh, thanks. And all the candles
have been replaced...

7
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:11,040
with these mini-lamps you asked for,
so now no more fire hazard.
Great.

8
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,848
Hey, did we sanitize these things?
Reuben!

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,447
- The best man is in the house! Ohh!
- Oh!

10
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:19,458
- Oh, my God!
- Sandy, you okay?

11
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:21,687
Jorgé, ice.
The best man went down.

12
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:25,129
Dance floor's like a Slip 'N Slide, dude.
I thought I told them not to wax this.

13
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:27,132
Twenty-three percent of the guests
are over 70.

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,328
I don't want anyone breaking a hip.
Okay. Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of it.

15
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:33,202
All right. I analyze risk for a living.
It's my job to worry.

16
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:35,571
Okay, let me do the worrying
'cause you gotta get married.
Right.

17
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:38,133
I'm good.

18
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:41,237
You got my note that
Harry Bard at table seven
is violently allergic to seafood?

19
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:43,748
Yes. His chicken will go
nowhere near the fish.

20
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:47,218
We're putting the finishing touches
on the cake.
This looks great. Lisa's gonna love it.

21
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,311
Hit me, dude.

22
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:58,988
Hey, aren't you that kid
from Crocodile Tears?

23
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:00,965
That's right. I'm Sandy Lyle.

24
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,002
Man, I saw that movie in high school.

25
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,299
That bagpipe scene,
that was the funniest shit, man.

26
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,499
We had a good time on that picture.
You want an autograph?

27
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,735
Ah, no, thanks.
It's good to see you, man.

28
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,836
I thought you died,
like, 15 years ago.

29
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:17,976
Ah. Nah.
I'm very much alive, my friend.

30
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:20,144
I've been doing a lot of stage acting.
Getting back to my roots.

31
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,154
- Sandy, we should get going 'cause...
- They're making an
E.! True Hollywood Story on me,

32
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:24,122
so that should clear up
a lot of your questions.

33
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:26,125
So they're really doing
one of those shows about your life?

34
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:28,491
Yeah. I got a camera crew
following me around
the next few weeks.

35
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,860
It's gonna be huge.
Wow. That's cool.

36
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:33,661
Reuben. Two-minute warning.
Lisa's on her way down.
Okay, thanks.

37
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,725
Look, Reuben.
Yeah.

38
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:38,930
Now, I'm asking you this because
you're my oldest friend in the world.

39
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:40,939
Uh-huh.
And I'm your wingman.

40
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:43,373
Okay. What?

41
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:46,776
Are you sure you wanna do this?

42
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:52,012
Sandy, there's not a doubt
in my mind.

43
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:55,486
Okay? I found the perfect woman.

44
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,750
We're totally in love.

45
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:00,122
My life's working out
just like I planned.

46
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:03,856
Let's go get married.
Okay.

47
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,455
- [Glass Breaks]
- Mazel tov.!

48
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,763
Go on. Kiss each other.

49
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:17,402
Big smile, everyone!
Come on. You love each other.

50
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:19,741
Smile, Grandma.

51
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:21,405
Having fun.

52
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:24,416
- #["Hava Nagila"]
- [Yelling]

53
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:26,577
Whoa!
[Screams]

54
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,587
[Cloth Rips]
Ohh!

55
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:32,591
Hello, everybody.
I'm Stan Indursky, Reuben's boss.

56
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,024
Thank you. You're very kind.

57
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:37,086
Now, Reub's not the sort of fellow
to brag about his own success,

58
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:39,097
so I'm going to do it for him.

59
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:41,531
The fact is, this young man here...

60
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:44,263
is the best risk assessment expert...

61
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:47,363
in this whole meshugas
we call the insurance business.

62
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,603
Irving, Vivian,
you've raised a wonderful son.

63
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:52,577
Let's hear it for him.

64
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:56,844
Reuben, Lisa, let me just say...

65
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:01,286
that I would insure your marriage
any day of the week.

66
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:03,288
Mazel, you two. Good things.

67
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:05,688
[Woman]
Mazel Tov!

68
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,593
Oh, and, Lisa, don't tire him out
too bad on the honeymoon.

69
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:13,565
- I need this kid fresh when he gets back.
- [Laughing]

70
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:17,000
- Mazel, mazel.! Good things.
- You know what, the truth is,

71
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,198
I've been waiting for this day
my entire life.

72
00:04:20,273 --> 00:04:24,073
And about four and a half years ago,
I met a real estate agent named
Lisa Kramer,

73
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:26,806
[Woman]
Lisa.!
who showed me an apartment,

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,041
which I rented
just so she'd go out with me.

75
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:31,310
I gave him a good price.
Yeah, not good enough.

76
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:34,080
She's a killer. No, seriously, um...

77
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:37,555
After about a month of dating,
I knew she was the one.

78
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:41,560
[Woman] Aw.
And I couldn't be happier...

79
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:44,927
that on this day that I've been
dreaming about for so long,

80
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:49,367
the woman I'm standing
next to... is you.

81
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:17,654
[Lisa Laughing]
Oh, my goodness.!

82
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:20,063
I lost my shoe!
Look at this place!

83
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,226
Oh, it's so pretty!
It's beautiful.

84
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:24,770
What?
[Screams]

85
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:36,043
How's your bruise?
It's okay.

86
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:38,812
You know, it's a little sore.

87
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:42,787
You know, they really should tell you
if they'rejust gonna let komodo dragons
run loose around the hotel.

88
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:44,790
Really.

89
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,860
Oh! How about this one?

90
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:55,196
Let's see. "Recently renovated colonial
in Montclair, three-bedroom."

91
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:58,237
Sweetie, remember?
We took a virtual tour of this one
on the Internet.

92
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:00,499
It was perfect,
but just a little pricey.

93
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:03,440
Oh, right, right. That's right.

94
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,444
It's probably off the market anyway.

95
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:07,446
Why do you say that?

96
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:10,142
'Cause I bought it.

97
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:12,241
You what?

98
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:14,684
I bought it!

99
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:18,188
Uh...
[Both Laughing]

100
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:22,354
Reuben, I'm in shock.
I mean, you just... you don't...
you don't do things like that.

101
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:24,488
You love it, right?
Yes, I do, but, Reuby...

102
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:26,725
We have a house!
Oh, my God,
we have a house!

103
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,768
Honey!

104
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:31,563
- Hi. Hello.
- [Laughs]
Oh!

105
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:34,072
- [French Accent]
How's it going?
- [Chuckles]

106
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,200
Uh, it's, uh, going great.
Thank you.

107
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:42,010
So I see you gang are new to the island.
I want to come have a meet with you,
show you my boat.

108
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:44,414
That is my boat there
on the sandbar.

109
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:48,921
- It's very, uh, big.
- Yeah, it's pretty good size.
It's good size.

110
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:52,685
So, tell me true,
are you guys for scuba?

111
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,693
What does that mean?

112
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:57,423
I'm like the unofficial
scuba king of St. Barts,

113
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:59,863
so if you are for scuba,
I take you out on the boat,

114
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:01,901
I show you the coral reef,

115
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:04,368
and we have kinda like a...
like a scuba party.

116
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:07,929
That sounds great,
but we're not certified,
so we're gonna have to pass.

117
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:11,306
That is no biggie.
I get you resort-certified
couple of hour.

118
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:15,074
- Oh, I have always wanted to try it.
- Yeah?

119
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:17,378
Good. My name is Claude.
What is, uh, you guys' name?

120
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,418
Uh, my name is Reuben.

121
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:22,751
This is my wife, Lisa.
"Leuban,"
I am here all afternoon.

122
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:26,155
All right, au revoir, Leuban, Lisa. Solid.

123
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,524
Solid.

124
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:30,825
Hi. Hello.
How's it going?

125
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:37,969
Leuban! Lisa!

126
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:39,937
Hey.
Hi!

127
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:41,633
Hello.

128
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:46,509
Isn't this exciting?
It is. It's fun.

129
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,173
You know what? I think I'm gonna
skip the scuba diving.

130
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:52,776
Reuben, no. You called eight hotels.
They all said that this guy was the best.

131
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:55,912
I know, but you know
how I am about boats,
and I'm feeling a little queasy.

132
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,923
Oh, no.
Your stomach's acting funny?

133
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:01,427
It's okay now, but I think it might...
You know how it gets, you know?
So why don't you go?

134
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,485
We're on our honeymoon.
I'm not gonna go without you.

135
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:06,760
No! You've been wanting to try this.
I want you to go, okay?

136
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,927
No.
It'll be fun. I'll pick you up
like at 4:00, all right?

137
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:12,631
I love you.
I love you too.

138
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:18,273
Okay? Okay.

139
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:22,210
You're not for scuba, Leuban?
No, Claude.

140
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:25,012
- I'm gonna go run some errands in town.
- [Scoffs]

141
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,847
But you guys go. You have fun.
Can I talk to you for a second though?

142
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,821
- Of course.
- [No Audible Dialogue]

143
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,054
Hey, listen, this woman means more
to me than anything else in the world,

144
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:39,121
so be careful 'cause scuba can be
very dangerous if the proper
precautions aren't taken.

145
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:42,430
Leuban, look to me in my eyeball.

146
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:47,166
I promise you I take care of Lisa
as if she were my own flesh and blood.

147
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,174
Thank you.
Okay?

148
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:50,732
Okay.
Okay. Solid!

149
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,243
Okay. Solid.
Okay.

150
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:56,775
All right? Are you ready?
Yeah, yeah.

151
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,580
So is there gonna be
a little boat that comes over...
Alley-oop.

152
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:02,746
[Screams]
Oh!

153
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:05,017
Ha ha!

154
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:07,184
Au revoir, Leuban.
Bye-bye, honey.!

155
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,728

Knock, knock!
[Metal Clanging]

165
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:47,299
Oh, my God.

Ooh la la.! Ooh la la.!

[Glass Shatters]
Oh, my God!

168
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:56,402
Holy shit, Leuban!
This is not what it look like.

169
00:09:56,476 --> 00:10:00,469
- You're staying on the island with Claude?
- I'm a little confused right now, Reuben.

170
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:02,741
I think I need a little time
just to figure things out.

171
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:05,784
What did you do to her?
Did you mess around with her
oxygen tanks or something?

172
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:09,447
I did nothing, Leuban.
My name is not "Leuban"!
It is "Reuben"!

173
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:13,117
Look, we had a scuba,
we talk about life,
we drink some white wine.

174
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,922
We cannot help it.
It is like love at first sight.

175
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:18,759
She make like the fire in my trouser.

176
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:23,291
- Ohh!
- What he's trying to say, Reuben,
is that we didn't plan it.

177
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:25,428
Reuben, itjust... it happened.

178
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:27,496
It's like the story of the hippo.

179
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:30,235
I'm not familiar with that story.

180
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,906
The hippopotamus, he is not born
going, "Cool bean, I am a hippo."
No way, José.

181
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:40,112
So he tried to paint the stripe on himself
to be like the zebra, but he fool no one.

182
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:43,883
And then he tried to put the spot
on his skin to be like the leopard,

183
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:46,084
but everyone know he is a hippo.

184
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,789
So at certain point,
he look himself in the mirror,
and hejust say,

185
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:55,459
"Hey, I am a hippopotamus,
and there is nothing I can do about it."

186
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:59,835
And as soon as he accepts this,
he live life happy.

187
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,306
Happy as a hippo.

188
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,309
You understand?

189
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:10,178
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Reuben.! No, Reuben.!

190
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,774
- [Gasps]
- Leuban, this is not the way!

191
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:20,022
You're gonna be fine, Reuben.
No, I'm not gonna be fine.

192
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:22,687
I'm not gonna be fine at all.

193

- [Engine Starts]
- And don't come back to me
when you've changed your mind!

Hey, Tina. Hey, Mitch.

Hey, Reub.

What?

00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:11,770
How does everyone
know about this?

204
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:16,366
Your mother called Mr. Indursky
and told him what happened.

205

I am so sorry, Reuben.
Thanks, Gladys.

206
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,647
Come here.
Oh. Okay.

207
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:23,648
Thank you. All right.

I know, I know.
Okay.

Fuck. Hey, there he is!

The big man's back.
Hey.

211
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:35,822
Reub, come on in here.
I want to spitball something with you.

212
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:40,093
All right. Can you give me a minute, Stan?
I'm just gonna run to the men's room.

213
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,964
I'll join you.

214
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:45,697
I heard about your honeymoon.

215
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:48,035
Just terrible.

216
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,598
I knew that girl was a slut
the second I met her.

217
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,046
Yeah, well, you know,
it's kind of complicated.

218
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:58,140
Hey, don't make excuses.
She's a dime-store hooker,
and she always will be.

219
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:01,584
Just put it behind you.
Speaking of which,

220
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:04,782
you ever hear of a guy
named Leland Van Lew?

221
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:07,348
Um, Leland Van Lew.
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:10,418
Australian guy, right?
Um, was on the cover
of Forbes last year?

223
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:12,430
Exactly.
[Farts]

224
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:15,262
[Urinating]
Yeah, he started one of
those high-tech, modem-scrotum,

225
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,268
God only knows what they do
companies anyway.

226
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:20,737
Jesus Christ. They want to take
the company public,

227
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:24,071
and if he wants to remain the C.E.O.
of a publicly held company,
guess what he needs.

228
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:26,373
Life insurance.
Bingo was his name.

229
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:29,141
All right, you want me
to check him out?
Yeah.

230
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:32,082
There's just one catch.
[Urinating Continues]

231
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:34,483
Yeah?
This Van Lew has
a reputation as a cowboy.

232
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:37,819
Apparently, he's one of these
extreme sports nuts.

233
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,882
[Splashing]
So it's a long shot,

234
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,360
but if you can
pull this thing together,
[Zips]

235
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,363
might be a lot of dough in it for us,

236
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,264
maybe a little extra bonus for you,
help you with those house payments.

237
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:52,498
All right. Well, let's make sure
he checks out first and...
You see?

00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:57,271
This is why you're the only one
I can trust with these jobs.

239
00:14:57,343 --> 00:15:01,245
I was worried that you'd
been through hell and back
with that whore wife of yours.

You sure you don't need
some more time off?

Mm-hmm. I'm good.
Absolutely sure?

This is private property.
Oh, yeah. No, I know.

I move in next month.

friends and family and...

To tell you the truth, I've been
waiting for this day my entire life.

Yeah.

I'm not going to a party.

What do you think is gonna happen?
Lisa's gonna come waltzing through
that door, saying she made a mistake?

No, of course not. I'm just... -

out of what the hell she did.

- Check out her expression.
She's terrified.

- She's smiling.
- I'm a student of acting, Reuben.

It's an art opening
for this Dutch guy, Jost.

really good pot.

the whole time.

Do we, like, get a drink...

you dumped your last boyfriend?

to buy that now.

uh, bread, wine bottles and...

323
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:24,664
Anyway, uh, so what's your deal?
You've got to be married with kids...

324
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:26,671
and the whole thing.

325
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:30,903
No, I'm not. I'm single.
Yeah, I haven't taken the plunge.

326
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:33,103
- Oh.
- Can I talk to you for a sec?

327
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:38,241
Yeah. Hey, Sandy, this is Polly Prince.
Remember? From middle school?
Hey, how you doing?

328
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:41,684
Wow. Okay. Sandy Lyle.

329
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:46,418
Last time I saw you, you were
playing bagpipes in that movie.

330
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:48,357
Croco Tears.
Yep, that's me.

331
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,952
[Laughs]
Polly, can I have a word with you?

332
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,590
Yeah. Sorry.
Excuse us.

333
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:57,466
What happened to you?
Reuben, I'm in a situation here.
We have to leave now.

334
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:59,595
No. Can we stay
a couple more minutes?
Dude, no.

335
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:02,641
This is serious.
I just sharted.

336
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,233
I don't know what that means.
I tried to fart
and a little shit came out.

337
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:08,109
I just sharted. Now let's go.

338
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:13,045
You're the most disgusting person
I've ever met in my life.

339
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:15,643
You have to walk around
and pour wine.
Mm-hmm.

340
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:18,121
Polly?
Focus for one second, okay?
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,326
So, hey, guy.
I got to go circulate.
[Chuckles]

342
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:29,231
Um, but... So, Sandy,
you're good though?
You're still acting?

343
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:32,099
I am. Yeah. It's going incredibly well.

344
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:35,299
I'm actually headlining a new revival
of Jesus Christ Superstar.

345
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:37,308
That's great!
Yeah.

346
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:39,776
Well, it was really good
seeing you guys.
Yeah, you too.

347
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:41,779
Okay. See ya.
All right. Bye, Polly.

348
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:44,645
- Be good.
- Bye. More wine?

349
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:47,185
Polly Prince.

350
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,482
It's funny, huh? Seeing her.

351
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:53,286
Are you okay?
Great. Thank you.

352
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,850
Huh. She looks good.

353
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:59,588
Let it rain!

354
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:03,624
So I did a lot of thinking last night,
and there's something
I'm pretty excited about.

355
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:06,068
What's up? Nice.

356
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:10,768
Let it rain!
I feel like I might be ready to move on.

357
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:12,936
You know, get my life back on track.

358
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:16,379
So, I am going to ask
Polly Prince on a date.

359
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:19,781
Oh, that's a mistake!
She's not right for you, dude.

360
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:22,184
Rain dance!

361
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:24,848
Hey, you guys
want to play some twos?

362
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:28,654
Actually, we're kind of
in the middle of a conversation, so...
You douche bags bring your "A" game?

363
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:30,661
What was that?

364
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:34,290
I'm just messing with you,
sasquatch. Let's get it on.

365
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:39,133

Outlet! Outlet!

366

Sandy, come on.

367
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:44,643

368
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,473

371
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,180

My lungs are burning.

374
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:03,922

So why do you think
Polly's so wrong for me?

You don't even know
this girl, Reuben.

377
00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:10,368
You haven't seen her
since seventh grade.

378
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:13,997
How different could she be?
I mean, she was a senior delegate
at the Model U.N.

379
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:16,598
She was in the chess club.
She was a "mathlete."

380
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:19,576
Her yearbook stats are really impressive.
Did you see the tattoo on her back?

381
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:21,442
Yeah. So what?

382
00:23:21,513 --> 00:23:24,676
Mathletes don't wear body art
like that. 'Nuff said. Ball in!

383
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,481
I really feel like
I ran into Polly for a reason.

384
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:31,079
Really. I mean, I'm sorry
if you don't agree, Sandy,

385
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:33,681
but I happen to believe
in a little thing called destiny.

386
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:38,930
You guys ready?

387
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,897
You know what? You think maybe
you could put your shirt back on?

388
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:46,103
You guys ready to play?

389
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,271
Good shot. Good shot.

390
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:57,872
Could I have the ball for a second?
Could I have the ball?

391
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:06,683
Hey, you know what?
Could we switch?

392
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,388
I'd rather not, dude. I just found out
how to cover this man right here, okay?

Yes, can I get the number
for a Polly Prince, please?

Hi. This is so funny.
I didn't know you lived down here.

Yeah, yeah, I do.
Hey, do you live around here too?

Um, no, I don't think so.

426
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:38,366
Are you sure?
'Cause I got a hang-up,

427
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:43,642
so I did that star-69 thingy,
and I swore I got your answering machine.

Really? You know,
I heard that from a few people.

got crossed or something.

Oh. Yeah.

00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:36,818
I know it's your song, but I felt something,
and I decided to go with it.

485
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:39,220
But you're playing Judas.

486
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:43,159
Judas. All right, look. Here's the deal.
I'm the star of the show, okay?

487
00:29:43,228 --> 00:29:47,892
So if I decide to bust out a solo,
do me a favor and give me
the freedom to rock out.

488
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:49,490
From the top, okay, Wonsuk?

489
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:51,536
So the play's going well?

490
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:53,537
Yeah, I think it's gonna be fun.

491
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:55,573
I mean, I just wish they wouldn't
surround me with a bunch of amateurs.

492
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,577
Uh-huh. Isn't that like
the point of community theater?
Whatever, Reuben.

493
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:02,579
So I'm going on a date with Polly.

494
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,808
All right! Where are you taking her?

495
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:07,078
I don't know.
Some restaurant in the East Village.

496
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:10,053
She left the address on my machine.

497
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:13,785
How could you let Polly
pick the restaurant?

498
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:16,054
Well, I had no choice.
She called me, like, seven times...

499
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:18,756
to confirm and then cancel
and then confirm again.

500
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,025
Why? What's wrong with
letting her pick the place?

501
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:25,468
You've got irritable
bowel syndrome, dude.

502
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:29,200
If she chose an ethnic restaurant,
you're gonna be running to
the bathroom every five seconds.

503
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:32,709
Oh, my God. You're right.

504
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:35,177
Thank you.

505
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:39,013
You know, I doubt it'll get this far,
but if she turns out to be
easier than I thought,

506
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:41,018
there's something
you need to know.

507
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:43,350
I'm not a virgin, Sandy.

508
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:46,390
No, not technically,
but times have changed
since you were last single.

509
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:51,657
Now, listen, when I'm making out
with a girl for the first time,

510
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,630
I like to give her
a little spankin'.

511
00:30:53,698 --> 00:30:55,689
What?
Nothing violent.

512
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:58,463
You just tap her real light
right on the tushy and say,

513
00:30:58,537 --> 00:31:01,734
"Hey, I'm your daddy.
I'm your daddy."

514
00:31:01,806 --> 00:31:04,206
Listen to me.

515
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:06,574
What are you doing?
I'm blotting the grease.

516
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:10,342
That's the best part. Let me see that.
Listen, don't be shy.

517
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:13,976
- It's just a little tap. It's like saying,
"Boop, I'm your daddy."
- I'm not gonna tap her.

518
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:18,751
Brings 'em right back to childhood.
Trust me, they're putty in your hands
after that.

519
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:21,724
I gotta tell you,
I'm really excited about this. Really.

520
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:24,057
I feel like this could be
one of those...

521
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:26,859

or something, you know?

522

[Laughs]
Yeah, I actually think
it's not gonna work out,

523
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:31,502
but I'm pulling for you, Reub.

524
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:35,039
Just pray to God
she doesn't go ethnic.

525
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:37,472
The place didn't sound ethnic.

526
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:40,170
What was the name?
Al Hafez.

529
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:50,611
In the late '90s. I bounced around
to a bunch of different places
over the past few years.

530

Oh, God, where?

Wow. Were you in the Peace Corps?
No, I just like to move a lot.

534
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:06,262
I kinda get stir-crazy if I'm stuck
in one place for too long,
you know what I mean?

535

- Oh, yeah, completely.

You were the person who broke...
Oh, my God!

00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:15,134
I can't believe
you remember that.
Oh, of course.

538
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:18,148
You were like the greatest delegate
in Model U.N. history.

539
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:20,776
I guess I did manage
to pass a few resolutions.

Okay.
Yeah, but I love it.

I can't believe you're not married.
I mean, even when we were kids,

545
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,792
I always saw you as that guy that would
settle down at a young age, you know?

546
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,600
You were always kinda like
an old young guy.
Yeah, well, it just hasn't happened.

long-term commitment thing.

Mm-hmm. Why? Are you coming out
of a bad relationship or...

552
00:32:58,189 --> 00:33:00,521
No, I'm kinda coming out of like
eight bad relationships.

- Eight?
- You sure I can't get you
a towel or something?

No, no. I'm good.
But if the right person came along,
things might be different, right?

Now, how do you kids know each other?
I told you.

663
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:51,262
Mom, we went to middle school together.
We were both delegates in the Model U.N.

Oh, you still work in government, honey?

No, no. I'm a waitress.

Oh, very nice. Reu, you'll never guess

- Sag.
- Sag. Did you try this?

671
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:16,186
Apparently, Lisa's doing wonderfully
down there in St. Barts,

672
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,626
- selling villas, happy.
- That's good for her.

673
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:21,221
- Now, who's Lisa?
- Nah.

674
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:23,426
- Not important.
- Lisa's Reuben's wife.

675
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:26,561
- Mm. Oh.
- She left him for another man
on their honeymoon.

676

- Are we ready for the check?
I think I'll take the check.

I was gonna tell you about Lisa.

681

I just, um...
I was embarrassed, and I...

682
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:48,089
I guess 'cause I hadn't seen you
for so long and...
Oh, it's so okay.

683
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,218
I understand.
No, I was an idiot.

684
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:52,592
I should've just told you the truth
right from the start.

685
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:57,566
Reuben, I'm really... I'm not upset.
But when did this happen?

686
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:59,728
Two weeks ago.

687
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:01,738
Two weeks ago?

688
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,602
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

689
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:11,107
Well, it was a pretty big shock.
[Scoffs]

690
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:14,151
I walked in on her, on Lisa,

691
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:18,814
with, um, a scuba instructor
on the first day of our honeymoon.

692
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:24,319
They were still wearing their flippers.
Anyway...

Um, I don't know
if you have any plans tonight,

698
00:41:44,348 --> 00:41:48,307

uh, 37 Gansevort Street...

702
00:41:56,627 --> 00:42:02,497
Okay, so, um, I'll see you later...
or not. I mean either way.

703
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:06,333

you should wear comfortable shoes.

That is if you come.
But you totally don't have to.

Um, what else?
Look, the thing is,

746
00:44:56,273 --> 00:44:59,470
I assess risk for a living,
so I know that I have a.013% chance...

747
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:01,477
of being hit by a car
on my way home,

748

or a one in 46,000 chance
of falling through a subway grate.

749
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:07,747

So I try to manage that risk
by avoiding danger...

knowing what my next move is,

live your life that way.

801
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:03,392
Yeah, I tried,
but I don't think she liked it.

802
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,588
Yeah, some women find it offensive.

803
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:09,428
Iceman!

804
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,936
I did not sleep with him
out of charity.

805
00:48:13,003 --> 00:48:16,564
You weren't interested till you found out
his wife boned some other guy
on their honeymoon.

806
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,872
That's not it.
He is a kind, decent, solid guy.

807
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:23,209
I've never been
with anybody like that.

808
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,215
Still sounds like a charity boning. Hi.
Thank you.

809
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:29,582
Do you have to use the word
"bone" every time?

810
00:48:29,653 --> 00:48:31,951
I use it when it's appropriate.

811
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:36,786
Have you ever heard of a guy
shouting out "50" when he orgasmed?
Yeah.

812
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,021
Yeah?

813
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:43,727
Okay, so throw pillows
go in this cabinet here.

814
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:48,133
Oh, you don't...
you don't sleep on these?

815
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:51,106
No, no, they're... decorative.

816
00:48:51,175 --> 00:48:54,702
- For who?
- What do you mean?

817
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:57,440
You're the only one who sees them,
but you don't sleep on them.

818
00:48:57,514 --> 00:49:00,381
Then you take them off the bed every night,
put 'em in a box, take them out of the box.

819
00:49:00,451 --> 00:49:03,079
I just don't understand the point.

820
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:06,122
I don't know. I mean,
Lisa thought they looked nice.

821
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,556
Oh. I see.
Yeah.

822
00:49:11,662 --> 00:49:13,755
Yeah.

823
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:22,962
I don't see what the big deal is.
They make the bed look nice.

824
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:28,067
Hey!

825
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:30,511
What are you doing?
That's goose down!
I'm liberating you.

826
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:33,239
Try it.
No!

827
00:49:33,317 --> 00:49:36,445
I'm not gonna...
Just one stab. Come on.
See how you feel.

828
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,420
Come on!
This is ridiculous.

829
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:40,116
It's not ridiculous.

830
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:44,752
It's not like driving a knife into a pillow
is suddenly gonna make me feel...

831
00:49:44,828 --> 00:49:46,762
Wow. That feels really good.

832
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,663
Huh? Right?
[Chuckles]
Yeah!

833
00:49:49,733 --> 00:49:51,997
- What did I tell you?
- You know what? You're right.

834
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:54,537
Come on. Bigger one.
What is the point
of these things really?

835
00:49:54,605 --> 00:49:57,540
No point.
They're stupid.
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

836
00:49:57,608 --> 00:50:01,339
Ha! Ha! Ha!
I mean, what, am I running
a bed-and-breakfast?

837
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:03,209
Not anymore.
You know how many minutes a day...

838
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,271
I spend getting throw pillows
on and off the bed?
How many?

839
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:07,442
Four minutes in the morning,
four minutes at night.
That's eight minutes of my life.

840
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:12,353
I figured it out. It's 56 minutes a week.
That's nearly two days of my life a year
I spent putting pillows on and off a stupid bed!

841
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:14,948
Ha! Ha!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

842
00:50:15,025 --> 00:50:17,220
[Yelling]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

843
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:20,991
- Wait, wait, wait. You hit mattress.
- Oh, yeah.
[Sighs]

844
00:50:21,065 --> 00:50:23,625
You know what?
I really gotta go. I'm late.

845
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:25,760
Shoot.
[Reuben] What's wrong?
You lose your keys again?

846
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:28,896
No, they're just not
where I left them before.

847
00:50:28,972 --> 00:50:32,305
Hey, why don't you use
that key finder I bought you?
Reuben, I don't...

848
00:50:32,376 --> 00:50:35,402
I think it could help.
need the stupid key finder!

849
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:38,448
All right. Anyway,
I was thinking I'd come meet you.

850
00:50:38,515 --> 00:50:42,508
Really? I thought you hated
dirty dancing clubs.
[Beeping]

851
00:50:42,586 --> 00:50:44,713
No, it's just salsa.
It'll be fun. I'll watch.

852
00:50:44,788 --> 00:50:46,722
Hey, what's that noise?
Nothing.

853
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,725
It's the key finder, isn't it?
No, it's so not the key finder.

854
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:51,852
Yes, it is!
It is not the key finder.
I'll see you later. Bye.

855
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:55,990
Yes, it...
Oh! How?

00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:26,652
Hey, Reuby Tuesday.
¿Cómo estás?

858
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,789
Yeah. Doin' all right.

859
00:51:33,036 --> 00:51:37,200
You know what? Actually,
me no estás too good, Javier.

860
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:40,401
I want you to stay away from Polly,
all right?

861
00:51:40,477 --> 00:51:42,411
Find yourself another dance partner.

862
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:44,777
- Why?
- Why?

863
00:51:44,848 --> 00:51:47,646
Because she and I are a couple, all right?
Yeah, we're dating.

864
00:51:47,718 --> 00:51:50,710
And I'm not gonna let
some big shot salsa king...

865
00:51:50,788 --> 00:51:53,814
sweep in with your mambo moves
and your Erik Estrada look...

866
00:51:53,891 --> 00:51:57,554
and come in and try to take her away,
because I've had that happen before
and it's not gonna happen again.

867
00:51:57,628 --> 00:52:00,722
- Reuben, I am gay.
- Hey, I don't care what you... What?

868
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:04,632
I'm homosexual. My boyfriend Hector,
he plays the keyboards in the house band.

00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:06,692
Oh.

870
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:11,565
Hey, you think maybe
you could give me some salsa lessons?

872
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:40,299
Huh.

873
00:52:41,505 --> 00:52:44,030
You hated it.
No, I don't.

874
00:52:44,107 --> 00:52:48,339
It's just... It's very graphic
for a children's book.

875
00:52:48,412 --> 00:52:53,782
You know, like this one:
"The Boy with a Nub for an Arm."

876
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:56,285
Well, that one has a moral.

877
00:52:56,353 --> 00:53:00,449
You know, to teach kids they gotta be careful
when they're playing with fireworks.

878
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:03,982
Right. No, and-and I think
it's brilliant, by the way. Seriously.
Uh-huh.

879
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:06,325
I mean, like,
you really convey...

880
00:53:06,396 --> 00:53:10,389
the pain and the fear,
and I love the little doggy too.

881
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:14,130
But... And I don't mean
this in a bad way.
Right.

882
00:53:14,204 --> 00:53:17,367
Just what were you thinking?

#[Salsa]

884
00:53:35,592 --> 00:53:38,686
So I put all the risks and rewards
into the program,
Okay. Right.

885
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:40,957

my recommendations.

"Leland Van Lew."
Ooh.! BASE jumping.!

887
00:53:44,134 --> 00:53:48,696
That is supposed to be so much fun.
That should be on the rewards side.

888
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:51,707
It's one of the most dangerous activities
a human being can do.

889
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:54,369
Really?
Have you done it?
Yeah.

890
00:53:54,444 --> 00:53:57,208
Have I parachuted off
the top of a building? No.
Uh-huh.

00:53:57,281 --> 00:53:58,543
No?
No.

892
00:53:58,615 --> 00:54:01,277
So how do you know
what it's like?

893
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:07,380
I don't.
Huh. Interesting.

894
00:54:08,959 --> 00:54:10,893
Would you like
some more bulgogi?
Sure.

00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:12,394
Yeah?
Yeah, thanks.

00:54:12,462 --> 00:54:14,692

Now you look like
a pro racquetballer.
How's that shirt fit, all right?

899
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:23,963
Uh, yeah, it's fine.
You know, I was thinking
maybe we can just sit and talk.

900
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:26,066
I'm not really
a big raquetball player.
No worries.

901
00:54:26,143 --> 00:54:28,236
We'll just get up a bit of a sweat.
Have a few giggles.

- [Yelling]
- [Screams]

903
00:54:34,151 --> 00:54:36,745
So I've been running the numbers,

904
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:41,488
and I gotta say...
things aren't looking
too good from our end.

[Groans]
Geez!

907
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:50,594
Leland, I mean,
it's not just the BASE jumping.

908
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:52,601
It's the heli-skiing,
[Yells]

909
00:54:52,669 --> 00:54:54,637
volcano luging, shark diving.

910
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:58,641
Bottom line is, unless
you drastically alter your lifestyle,

911
00:54:58,709 --> 00:55:01,177
we won't be able to insure you.

912
00:55:01,244 --> 00:55:03,610
Reuben, I came to you
for a reason.

913
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,614
I was told that you had
more imagination...

914
00:55:05,682 --> 00:55:07,843
than any of the other blokes
in the big firms...

915
00:55:07,918 --> 00:55:10,648
that you analyze the man
and not just the numbers.

916
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:13,713
I guess I was wrong.

917
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:16,190
Are you trying to manipulate me?
Of course I am.

918
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:19,126
But I wanna hold onto me company.
[Yells]

919
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:25,963
- Oh!
- I'll tell you what.

I'm gonna be in Nantucket
at the end of the month.

And I guarantee you
by the end of the weekend,
you'll know what a safe bet I really am.

Yeah, you know what?
Uh, you're bleeding pretty bad.

Oh, we gotta go do that.
I've never been to Nantucket.
You wanna come?

I would... Well, can... Is that rude?
Is it all right if I invite myself?

935
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:10,370
No! That'd be great. Okay, good.
So you're actually gonna
commit to something in advance.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

939
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:21,216
What are you doin'?
I'm-I'm gonna have some nuts.

940
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:25,022
No. You don't eat mixed nuts
at a bar. Everybody knows that.

941
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:26,892
What are you talking about?

942
00:56:26,963 --> 00:56:29,523
Okay. Let's say, uh,

943
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,763
conservatively, I don't know,
17 people eat these nuts on a given night.

944
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:37,398
Okay? If they've been here
for even two weeks,
we're talking about...

945
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:40,238
238 people who dipped
their dirty hands into that bowl.

946
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:42,574
Dirty... Why are their...
Why are their hands dirty?

947
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:45,911
On average, only one out of
every six people wash their hands
when they go to the bathroom.

948
00:56:45,982 --> 00:56:49,611
[Gasps]
Yeah, so when you think you're
innocently eating a little bar snack,

949
00:56:49,686 --> 00:56:53,486
you're actually ingesting potentially
deadly bacteria from about
39 soil-handed strangers.

950
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:56,856
I mean, people wonder
why they get E. coli poisoning
or salmonella or hepatitis,

951
00:56:56,927 --> 00:57:00,761
when all they gotta do
is look at the snack bowl
at their local watering hole.

952
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:03,932
I'm not being neurotic.
No.

953
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,468
It's an absolute hot zone in there.

954
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,338
How could you have eaten those?

955
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:14,741
l-l-l-I mean,
I made such a compelling argument.

956
00:57:14,811 --> 00:57:16,745

Yeah. You never know.

Reuben, I mean,
you don't have to do this.

960
00:57:34,698 --> 00:57:37,724
I don't care that you...
that you don't know how to dance.

961
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:40,361
No, I thought I'd give it one last try.
Hey, Javi.

962
00:57:40,437 --> 00:57:42,598
Hey, Reuben. You ready?

963
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:44,640
Uh-huh.
What is happening?

964
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:47,768
- [Shouts In Spanish]
- [Polly] What?

965
00:57:47,844 --> 00:57:51,336
- ## [Singing In Spanish]
- What are you doing?

966
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:16,069
Tzzz!

967
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:20,368
¡Yi.!

969
00:58:38,228 --> 00:58:41,493
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!

## [Ends]

971
00:59:11,027 --> 00:59:16,090
I don't even know where that
"yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi" thing came from.
It was just awesome.

972
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:18,134
[Polly]
Holy shit.!

973
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:28,567
What are you doing here?

974
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:32,972
I'm back.

975
00:59:34,618 --> 00:59:36,552
Who's this?

976
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:39,487
Who's this?
This is my girlfriend.
What?

977
00:59:39,556 --> 00:59:41,387
- You have a girlfriend?
- I'm not your girlfriend.

978
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:45,155
I mean, we'rejust kind of...
Hi, I'm Polly.

979
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,790
Lisa.
[Polly]
Right.

980
00:59:55,972 --> 00:59:59,567
So, yeah.
You know, you guys probably have
a lot to talk about.

981
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:02,168
So I'm just gonna go.
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't want you to go.

982
01:00:02,245 --> 01:00:04,907
That's okay. Please. I wanna go.
Bye, Lisa. Nice to meet you.
I don't...

983
01:00:04,981 --> 01:00:08,508
I don't want you to go.
I'm just gonna...
You gotta talk about it.

984
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:10,576
I'm just gonna go.

985
01:00:15,058 --> 01:00:18,255
[Scoffs]
[Reuben]
I don't understand.

986
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:21,297
I mean, I thought...
I thought you were really happy with Claude.

987
01:00:21,364 --> 01:00:24,925
l-I was for a few weeks.
But then all he ever talked about
was scuba diving.

988
01:00:25,001 --> 01:00:26,969
- Really?
- I missed you.

989
01:00:27,037 --> 01:00:30,029
Reuben...
I missed you too, but...
I mean, come on!

990
01:00:30,106 --> 01:00:33,667
What was I supposed to do?
I moved on. I'm in a relationship.

991
01:00:33,743 --> 01:00:35,438
- What, with that Polly person?
- Yeah.

992
01:00:35,512 --> 01:00:37,446
She doesn't even
call herself your girlfriend.

993
01:00:37,514 --> 01:00:40,210
She... That's... No.
She just doesn't like the phrasing.

994
01:00:40,283 --> 01:00:43,616
Oh, okay. Okay.
Then let mejust ask you this.

995
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:47,453
Are you really gonna spend
the rest of your life with her?

996
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:49,719
I don't know, Lisa.

997
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:52,193
Because I'm ready
to do that with you, Reuben.

998
01:00:52,262 --> 01:00:55,060
I made a mistake
and I took you for granted,

999
01:00:55,131 --> 01:00:59,067
but I promise you that
I will never, ever hurt you again.

1000
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:04,134
I love you, Reuben.

1001
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:13,009
You know what?
I think, um...

1002
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:16,211
I think you should, um,
go stay with your parents, okay,

1003
01:01:16,286 --> 01:01:18,220
'cause I gotta
be out of here in a week.

1004
01:01:18,288 --> 01:01:20,222
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?
Where am I going?

1005
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,520
I'm going into the house, remember?
The house that I bought for us to live in.

1006
01:01:22,592 --> 01:01:25,652
Well, then, let's-let's do it together.
Let's go move into our house.

1007
01:01:25,729 --> 01:01:28,027
You don't just...
No, we can't just go... I can't...

1008
01:01:28,098 --> 01:01:30,089
No. I can't...

1009
01:01:32,702 --> 01:01:36,866
I don't even know
what to say right now, okay? So...

1010
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:41,067
Okay.

1011
01:01:43,813 --> 01:01:45,747
[Polly]
If you wanna get back together
with her, just let me know.

1012
01:01:45,815 --> 01:01:47,749
No, I'm not planning
on getting back together with her.

1013
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:49,978
I wouldn't be seeing you
if I was planning...
It's cool, you know?

1014
01:01:50,053 --> 01:01:52,544
You guys are married.
She came back.
All right, Polly...

1015
01:01:52,622 --> 01:01:55,921
How's it coming
with Herb Lazare, D.D.S.?
Hello?

1016
01:01:55,992 --> 01:01:58,426
I haven't even gotten into it yet.
I'm-I'm still working on Van Lew.

1017
01:01:58,495 --> 01:02:01,055
Wait a minute. I thought
you decided on Van Lew two weeks ago.

1018
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:03,122
We're presenting to AFLAC
on Wednesday.

1019
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:06,259
Polly, can you hang on a second?
Just hang on one second.
No, I kinda have to go.

1020
01:02:06,336 --> 01:02:09,066
You better not be
bonus hunting on me, Reuben.
Bonus hunting?

1021
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:12,040
Stan, the man's career is on the line.
I owe it to him to give him
a thorough analysis.

1022
01:02:12,108 --> 01:02:13,973
All right.

1023
01:02:14,044 --> 01:02:16,103
I'm going to Barbados
with my mistress for the weekend.

1024
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:18,875
I want this Van Lew thing settled
by the time I get back. All right?

1025
01:02:18,948 --> 01:02:21,041
I am on it,
and I'm gonna make it happen.

1026
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:22,641
Good things.
Good things.

1027
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,584

Polly?

1028
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:26,588
Oh, damn!
[Doorbell Rings]

1029
01:02:26,656 --> 01:02:29,216
Hey, pal.
Hey, Larry.

1030
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:31,726
Lisa dropped this off for you.

1031
01:02:31,795 --> 01:02:34,821
Oh. Thanks.

1032
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:48,073
[Reuben's Voice]
I met a real estate agent
named Lisa Kramer...

1033
01:02:48,144 --> 01:02:52,103
who showed me an apartment,
which I rentedjust so
she'd go out with me.

1034
01:02:52,182 --> 01:02:54,116
[Lisa's Voice]
I gave him a good price.
Yeah, not good enough.

1035
01:02:54,184 --> 01:02:56,175
She's a killer.!

I just can't believe
she came back.
#[Continues, Indistinct]

1039
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:12,092
Can we please just focus for a second?
I'm almost finished.

1040
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:15,535
What's next?
Polly's career prospects.

1041
01:03:15,605 --> 01:03:18,631
Risky. She's writing a children's book
where kids get maimed.

1042
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:21,142
Yeah, see, I think her lack of career
is actually a positive,

1043
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:23,145
'cause she'd have more time
to spend with the kids.

1044
01:03:23,213 --> 01:03:25,181
[Sandy]
You're skewing the numbers
in Polly's favor, Reuben.

1045
01:03:25,248 --> 01:03:27,182
Why are we even doing this?

1046
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,241
Because I'm confused, Sandy.

1047
01:03:29,319 --> 01:03:31,879
I mean, my goddamn wife
shows up on my doorstep...

1048
01:03:31,955 --> 01:03:34,788
wanting to get back together,
Polly's freaking out.

1049
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:37,850
I just wanna make sure
I'm making the right decision.

1050
01:03:37,927 --> 01:03:39,690
[Moans]

1051
01:03:39,762 --> 01:03:44,028
I don't see how putting these two girls
in the Riskmaster's gonna help you
make up your mind.

1052
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,034
Mmm.

1053
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:51,339
Interesting.
What's it say?

1054
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:53,841
Polly.

1055
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:55,571
Polly?
Yeah.

1056
01:03:55,645 --> 01:03:58,739
No way.
You should just cut your losses
and get back with Lisa.

1057
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:03,548
Nah, I checked it, like, three times.
The program says she's the safer choice.
Whatever.

1058
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,986
By the way, dude,
is your health okay?

1059
01:04:06,055 --> 01:04:08,455
I mean,
you're looking kind of thin.

1060
01:04:08,525 --> 01:04:10,516
Uh, no. Polly's been
making me eat ethnic food,

1061
01:04:10,593 --> 01:04:13,687
so I've been
throwing up a lot lately.

1062
01:04:13,763 --> 01:04:16,197
Cool.
Polly Prince.

1063
01:04:18,034 --> 01:04:20,025
Polly Feffer.

1064
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:24,201
Polly Prince-Feffer.

1065
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:27,243
Come on. You can't cancel.
I thought you were so excited to go.

1066
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:29,244
I know, but...
Polly.

1067
01:04:29,312 --> 01:04:31,280
We fell in love with these
funny little Bolivian mud huts.
Hello?

1068
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:35,784
- Hold on.
- So we had our designer use
a similar color palette in here.

1069
01:04:35,852 --> 01:04:37,877
Hi. I'm sorry.
I'm on the phone.

1070
01:04:37,954 --> 01:04:40,388
Would you just please keep it...
Shh.

1071
01:04:40,456 --> 01:04:42,788
So, also, you know what else?

1072
01:04:42,859 --> 01:04:45,987
It's like I feel weird going away
for the weekend when
your wife's just come back into town.

1073
01:04:46,062 --> 01:04:48,053
I don't know why you're making this
into such a big deal.

1074
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:51,692
I told you I'm not
getting back together with her.
Okay.

1075
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:54,134
So are you coming or not?
I'm coming.

1076
01:04:54,204 --> 01:04:56,434
All right.
Okay?

1077
01:04:56,506 --> 01:04:58,440
Bye.
Okay, bye.

You're a natural.

01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,666
[Polly]
Oh.! This is amazing.!
Hey, Leland!

1084
01:05:26,736 --> 01:05:30,968
Are those storm clouds up ahead?

1085
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:35,306
Nah. We might just get
a light dusting, that's all.
Nothing to write home about.

[Thunderclap]

1087
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:40,682
Are you sure you're all right?

1088
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,810
[Reuben]
Oh, no, I'm okay.
I don't think I have my sea legs yet.

1089
01:05:43,886 --> 01:05:45,945
I'll be out in a sec.
All right.

1090
01:05:46,022 --> 01:05:49,321
Oh, God.

## [Fanfare]

1092
01:05:53,263 --> 01:05:55,527
So I know we haven't been
seeing each other that long,

1093
01:05:55,598 --> 01:05:59,659
but I really feel like
it's time we take things to the next level,

1094
01:05:59,736 --> 01:06:03,433
and I'd like you to consider
moving in with me.

1095
01:06:11,714 --> 01:06:14,012
Why don't we just...
Why don't we just move in together?

1096
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:25,192
Oh, yeah. We're gonna
have ourselves a tussle.

1097
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:28,321
[Chittering]
Hey, Polly!

1098
01:06:28,398 --> 01:06:31,333
Oh, my God.
Rodolfo's in your toiletry kit.!
Did you know that?

1099
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:33,699
Did you pack him,
or did you... did you...

1100
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:37,501
What-What is this?
I mean, why am I in your computer...

1101
01:06:37,573 --> 01:06:39,541
on your Riskmaster thingy and...
Okay, you know what?

1102
01:06:39,609 --> 01:06:43,807
I can explain this, Polly.
Well, no, it's fascinating.
I learned a lot about myself.

1103
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,646
I've learned that I have no career,
I'm flaky, I like ethnic food.

1104
01:06:47,717 --> 01:06:49,651
Polly, would you let me explain this?
Uh-huh.

1105
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:53,052
Lisa came back, and I, you know,
I've been trying to figure things out.

1106
01:06:53,122 --> 01:06:57,525
What are you figuring out, Reuben?
Just about us and our future.

1107
01:06:57,593 --> 01:06:59,390
Future?
What are you talking about?

1108
01:06:59,462 --> 01:07:01,396
What future?
Reuben, come on!

1109
01:07:01,464 --> 01:07:05,560
This is a fling, you know?
Come on. What, did you think
we were gonna get married?

1110
01:07:05,635 --> 01:07:08,433
Whoa! Maybe...

1111
01:07:08,504 --> 01:07:10,438
I was gonna ask you
to move in with me first.

1112
01:07:10,506 --> 01:07:12,906
Oh, my God.
You expect me to move
to the suburbs with you?

1113
01:07:12,975 --> 01:07:16,103
Reuben, are you insane?
Whoa! Why is that so crazy?

1114
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:19,205
People do that all the time.
They have kids,
they-they-they make plans,

1115
01:07:19,282 --> 01:07:21,216
they get married,
they buy houses.
You know what, though?

1116
01:07:21,284 --> 01:07:24,219
That's you, Reuben.
You do that, right?
That's what you do.

1117
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:27,552
I don't live my life that way.
Is your lack of a plan
that different than my plan?

1118
01:07:27,623 --> 01:07:29,955
I don't...
I don't have a plan.
Yes, you do!

1119
01:07:30,026 --> 01:07:33,723
You're on the non-plan plan.
I am not on a non-plan plan!

1120
01:07:33,796 --> 01:07:37,391
You are too!
I've never met anybody more afraid
of committing to anything.

1121
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:40,561
I mean, you were a senior delegate
at the Model U.N., Polly.

1122
01:07:40,636 --> 01:07:42,695
What the hell happened to you?
Whoa!

1123
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:45,639
[Leland]
Wahoo!

1124
01:07:46,943 --> 01:07:50,242
Come on, you mother!
You can do better than that!

1125
01:07:50,313 --> 01:07:52,213
I've been living my life, okay?

1126
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:55,216
I've been in good relationships
and I've been in shitty ones,

1127
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:58,776
and I've moved a lot,
and I've been happy
and I've been sad,

1128
01:07:58,855 --> 01:08:00,880
and I've been lonely,
and that's what I've been doing,

1129
01:08:00,957 --> 01:08:03,585
which is a lot more than I can say
for some freak who thinks...

1130
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:06,628
he's gonna get the Ebola virus
from a bowl of mixed nuts.

1131
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:09,290
Those nuts have pee on them!
It's common sense!

1132
01:08:09,365 --> 01:08:13,062
Oh, trust me, that is
so far beyond common sense, Reuben.

1133
01:08:13,136 --> 01:08:15,263
[Grunting]

1134
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:16,896
You don't understand
what I grew up with.

1135
01:08:16,973 --> 01:08:18,941
I had a mother
who made me afraid of everything.

1136
01:08:19,008 --> 01:08:22,341
Okay, well, big deal, Reuben.
My dad had a whole second family.

1137
01:08:22,412 --> 01:08:24,846
- What?
- Yeah, on Long Island.

1138
01:08:24,914 --> 01:08:28,145
A wife and kids
and a golden retriever.

1139
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:30,845
A second family?

1140
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,854
Whatever. Hey, you know what?

1141
01:08:32,922 --> 01:08:36,653
I'm, uh, glad I saw that.

1142
01:08:36,726 --> 01:08:38,421
Polly...
I am.
'Cause you know what?

1143
01:08:38,494 --> 01:08:41,554
I'm gonna make this
really, uh, easy for you, Reuben.

1144
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:44,532
I have, um...
I have no interest...

1145
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,366
in getting married
and moving to the suburbs.

1146
01:08:48,438 --> 01:08:50,736
And, obviously, that's something
that's really important to you.

1147
01:08:50,807 --> 01:08:53,298
So here's what I think
your new plan should be.

1148
01:08:53,376 --> 01:08:55,310
I think you should
get back together with Lisa,

1149
01:08:55,378 --> 01:08:58,609
move into your house,
and move on with your life.

1150
01:08:58,681 --> 01:09:02,173
And-And, uh, I think
you guys will be really happy together.

1151
01:09:02,251 --> 01:09:04,981
Oh, dear Lord.

1152
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:06,316
Whoa!

1153
01:09:10,326 --> 01:09:12,590
[Reuben]
You're not making myjob
any easier, Leland.

1154
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:16,860
Ah, come on, Reub.
Weather report said sunny skies.

1155
01:09:35,918 --> 01:09:38,716
# Your sorry eyes

1156
01:09:39,989 --> 01:09:43,390
# They cut through the bone

1157
01:09:43,459 --> 01:09:46,394
# They make it hard

1158
01:09:46,462 --> 01:09:48,191
# To leave you alone

1159
01:09:48,264 --> 01:09:50,323
[Polly On Answering Machine]
Hey, it's Polly... Prince.

1160
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,596
Leave me a message, or call back,
or not.

1161
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:55,830
You know, whatever.
Okay, bye.
[Beeps]

1162
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:58,806
Hey, Polly, it's me.
Listen, um,

1163
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:00,809
I would like to talk to you,
all right?

1164
01:10:00,877 --> 01:10:02,936
'Cause I feel really bad
about what happened, and...

1165
01:10:03,012 --> 01:10:04,946
Just give me a call
on my cell phone, all right?

1166
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,775
#Baby, you're a lost

1167
01:10:11,621 --> 01:10:13,885
#Baby, you're a lost

1168
01:10:13,956 --> 01:10:16,447
[Ringing]

1169
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:19,154
#Baby, you're a lost cause

1170
01:10:19,228 --> 01:10:22,391
Hello?
Hi. It's Lisa.

1171
01:10:22,465 --> 01:10:26,595
Oh. Hey.
So, how's the house?

1172
01:10:26,669 --> 01:10:29,536
The house is, uh...
it's great.

1173
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:31,835
Yeah, it's big,
but, you know, great.

1174
01:10:31,908 --> 01:10:35,571
Well, I can't wait to see it.
Hey, did you get the gift I sent you?

1175
01:10:35,645 --> 01:10:37,579
Yeah, I did. Thanks.

1176
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:41,276
I really wanna
see you, Reuben.

1177
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:44,114
I don't know, Lisa.
Let me think about it.

1178
01:10:44,186 --> 01:10:47,485
#Fighting for a lost cause

1179
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:50,352
[Man Over P.A.]
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

1180
01:10:50,426 --> 01:10:53,088
The premiere ofJesus Christ Superstar
is about to begin.

1181
01:10:53,162 --> 01:10:55,096
Hey!

1182
01:10:55,164 --> 01:10:57,359
Reuby Tuesday.!
Hey! Javi!

1183
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:59,025
¿Cómo estás?
What are you doin' here?

1184
01:10:59,101 --> 01:11:01,365
What else?
Hector's playin' keyboards
in the band.

1185
01:11:01,437 --> 01:11:03,997
Ah.
I didn't figure you
a fan of musical theater.

1186
01:11:04,073 --> 01:11:07,133
No, my friend Sandy Lyle
is in the show.

1187
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:09,643
Hey, have you, um...
have you talked to Polly?

1188
01:11:09,712 --> 01:11:13,910
She was upset, bro.
Must've been some kind of fight, huh?

1189
01:11:13,983 --> 01:11:17,009
Yeah. I keep calling her up,
and she won't pick up the phone.

1190
01:11:17,086 --> 01:11:20,249
I don't know, I was thinking
about maybe dropping by tomorrow.

1191
01:11:20,323 --> 01:11:23,952
It's a bit too late, papi.
She's leaving town in about two hours.

1192
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:28,258
What? W-Why?
Where is she going?
I don't know.

1193
01:11:28,331 --> 01:11:29,992
She said good-bye.
That's it.

1194
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:32,466
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
Hey.

1195
01:11:32,535 --> 01:11:34,002
Oh, no. Yeah.
Hi.

1196
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:35,799
Hi.

1197
01:11:35,871 --> 01:11:37,839
Hey, Javi, this is Lisa,

1198
01:11:37,907 --> 01:11:40,273
my... wife.

1199
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:45,213
#[Guitar]

1200
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:48,648
Hey.
Oh.

1201
01:11:59,061 --> 01:12:02,690
Her mother told me she was back.
You're doing the right thing here, Reub.

1202
01:12:02,765 --> 01:12:06,496
Relax, Mom.
I'm not promising anything.
It's very exciting.

1203
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,801
[Cell Phone Ringing]
Reuben Feffer.

1204
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:14,809
Reuben, Stan.
Change of plan.

1205
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:18,643
The meeting with Van Lew's board
and the AFLAC people's moved to 4:00.
4:00?

1206
01:12:18,714 --> 01:12:22,377
I don't know if I can do that.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Get your ass over here!

1207
01:12:22,451 --> 01:12:25,147
[Over P.A.]
Good evening, folks.
Uh, I'm Sandy Lyle,

1208
01:12:25,221 --> 01:12:28,213
and I've got
a very special announcement.

1209
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,258
Please note that in tonight's performance,
#[Stops]

1210
01:12:30,326 --> 01:12:32,260
in addition to playing
the role ofJudas,

1211
01:12:32,328 --> 01:12:33,989
I'll be playing Jesus as well.

1212
01:12:34,063 --> 01:12:36,896
Thank you very much
and enjoy the show.
[Man] Sandy, what are you doing?

1213
01:12:36,966 --> 01:12:38,866
Wonsuk is playing Jesus.

1214
01:12:38,934 --> 01:12:40,868
[Sandy]
It's cool. I'm playing dual roles.

1215
01:12:40,936 --> 01:12:43,029
Give me your crown, okay, Wonsuk?
[Wonsuk]
Screw you, Sandy.!

1216
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:46,097
You're a has-been.
No one even cares
you were in that stupid movie.

1217
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:48,769
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit! Aah!

1218
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:52,777
[All Gasping]
[Wonsuk]
Judas is biting me.!

1219
01:12:55,151 --> 01:12:58,143
What just happened in there?
I am a professional, Reuben,

1220
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:02,919
and I'm not gonna put
my reputation on the line
for a group of freaking amateurs.

1221
01:13:02,992 --> 01:13:06,689
[Irving]
It's always the same story
with you, huh, pal?

1222
01:13:08,264 --> 01:13:11,631
You did this one movie
a hundred years ago.

1223
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:14,636
From then on, you thought
you were better than everybody else.

1224
01:13:14,704 --> 01:13:18,902
Why don't you let go?
Move on with your life.

1225
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:21,499
It's not about
what happened in the past...

1226
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:23,704
or what you think
might happen in the future.

1227
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:26,247
It's about the ride, for Christ's sake.

1228
01:13:27,316 --> 01:13:29,784
There's no point going through
all this crap...

1229
01:13:29,852 --> 01:13:31,945
if you're not gonna
enjoy the ride.

1230
01:13:32,021 --> 01:13:34,785
And you know what?
When you least expect it,

1231
01:13:34,857 --> 01:13:37,018
something great might come along...

1232
01:13:37,093 --> 01:13:40,620
something better
than you even planned for.

1233
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:46,294
You were funny as hell
playing those bagpipes, though.

1234
01:13:46,368 --> 01:13:48,393
Did I ever tell you that?

1235
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:52,840
l-I don't think I've ever heard you
speak before, Mr. Feffer.

1236
01:13:58,681 --> 01:14:03,744
So, Reuby, we're gonna grab a bite
after your work thingamajigy?

1237
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:06,481
No, Lisa.

1238
01:14:06,555 --> 01:14:09,183
I shouldn't have asked you
to come down here.

1239
01:14:09,258 --> 01:14:11,192
I'm not getting back together with you.

1240
01:14:12,595 --> 01:14:16,292
What are you talking about?
W-Why?
Why?

1241
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:22,460
You screwed a scuba diving instructor
on our honeymoon.

1242
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:25,006
I mean, what kind
of cold, heartless bitch...

1243
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:27,941
would do that to someone they love?

1244
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:30,604
I'd have to be an idiot
to get back together with you after that.

1245
01:14:32,915 --> 01:14:35,543
Oh, and by the way,
I destroyed all your little throw pillows.

1246
01:14:35,618 --> 01:14:38,382
Yeah, because throw pillows suck, okay?

1247
01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:42,288
They serve no purpose.
They're purely decorative.

1248
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:47,854
Dude, that was incredible.

1249
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:50,296
You're the one who told me
I should get back together with her.
Reuben.

1250
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,630
Whatever you do,
don't ever take my advice again.

1251
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:56,193
Your dad totally
put it in perspective for me.

1252
01:14:56,272 --> 01:14:59,639
I was barely famous back then,
and I'm never gonna be famous again.

1253
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:02,574
What about your
E.! True Hollywood Story?

1254
01:15:02,645 --> 01:15:05,671
The E! Channel doesn't even know
we're making this show.

1255
01:15:05,748 --> 01:15:08,478
What do you mean?

1256
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:11,486
I hired Dustin and Vic myself.

1257
01:15:11,554 --> 01:15:15,251
And I was gonna try and sell it
to the network when I'm done.

1258
01:15:15,324 --> 01:15:18,691
You mean you're doing
an E.! True Hollywood Story
on yourself?

1259
01:15:18,761 --> 01:15:20,592
[Chuckles]

1260
01:15:20,663 --> 01:15:23,757
Sandy, that's so...
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1261
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:26,324
I know. I'm such a loser.

1262
01:15:31,574 --> 01:15:35,237
Look, I need you to do something
for me that's really, really important.

1263
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:37,609
So you gotta promise me
just this one time
you won't screw it up.

1264
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,944
Reuben, I'm your wingman.

1265
01:15:40,015 --> 01:15:42,848
Whatever it is,
I will not let you down.

1266
01:15:42,918 --> 01:15:45,409
Your Reuben's proxy?
What the hell does that mean?

1267
01:15:45,487 --> 01:15:49,287
Now, he's dealing with a personal situation,
so he asked me to fill in.

1268
01:15:49,358 --> 01:15:51,417
Now, you gotta relax.
I'm a professional actor,
