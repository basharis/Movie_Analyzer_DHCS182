1
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,874
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

2
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:11,236
Get out of the car.

3
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:56,070
The boys found this on the floor,
in the back of the Caddy.

4
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:58,855
Yeah, they showed me.

5
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,239
Could be unrelated.

6
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:05,255
Could be.

7
00:09:05,818 --> 00:09:09,009
Any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings?

8
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:11,031
No.

9
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:15,417
Could be someone's missing, maybe.

10
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:18,681
That’s what I'm thinking.

11
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:58,902
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:46,522
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:50,037
To Winkie's?

14
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,291
This Winkie's.

15
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:57,060
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

16
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:02,908
It’s kind of embarrassing.

17
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,605
Go ahead.

18
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:12,477
- I had a dream about this place.
- Oh, boy.

19
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,492
See what I mean?

20
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:20,239
Okay, so you had a dream
about this place.

21
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:23,646
Tell me.

22
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:28,686
Well...

23
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:34,435
it’s the second one I've had.
But they're both the same.

24
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:40,099
They start out that I'm in here but...

25
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,888
it’s not day or night...

26
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:45,771
it’s kind of half-night, you know?

27
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:48,902
But it looks just like this.

28
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,135
Except for the light.

29
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:55,579
And I'm scared like I can't
tell you.

30
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,587
Of all people...

31
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:02,409
you're standing right over there.

32
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:08,453
By that counter.

33
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:13,818
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

34
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:19,454
I get even more frightened when
I see how afraid you are, and...

35
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:26,056
then I realize what it is.

36
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,976
There's a man...

37
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:35,003
in back of this place.

38
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:39,666
He's the one who's doing it.

39
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:44,224
I can see him through the wall.

40
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:46,621
I can see his face.

41
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:57,483
I hope that I never see that face
ever outside of the dream.

42
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,733
That’s it.

43
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:14,114
So... you came to see
if he's out there.

44
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:20,444
To get rid of this
god-awful feeling.

45
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:25,487
Right then.

46
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,372
It’s around the back.

47
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:26,641
Dan! Dan, are you all right?

48
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,698
What is it, Dan? Dan?

49
00:16:55,244 --> 00:16:56,275
Hello?

50
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:01,362
The girl is still missing.

51
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:25,538
- Talk to me.
- The same.

52
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,767
I can't believe it.

53
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:39,262
Well, it's time to say
good-bye, Betty.

54
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:42,817
- It’s been so nice traveling with you.
- Thank you, Irene.

55
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:46,638
I was so excited and nervous. It was
sure great to have you to talk to.

56
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:51,269
- I'll watch for you on the big screen.
- Okay, Irene.

57
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:53,431
Won't that be the day?

58
00:18:53,643 --> 00:18:55,896
Good luck, Betty dear.

59
00:18:56,113 --> 00:19:00,277
- Take care of yourself and be careful.
- I will.

60
00:19:00,498 --> 00:19:02,515
Thanks, again.

61
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,713
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

62
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:07,515
Thank you.

63
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:19,865
- My bags?
- Where to?

64
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:23,212
1612, Hayvenhurst.

65
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:27,566
Got it.

66
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:49,884
- Ten bucks says you're Betty.
- Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

67
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:54,130
- It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?
- In all my living glory, baby.

68
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:59,203
- Pleased to meet you.
- Call me Coco. Everybody else does.

69
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,753
- Wait there and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.

70
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:09,190
Wilkins!

71
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:10,436
Wilkins!

72
00:21:10,657 --> 00:21:14,133
If that damn dog craps
in the courtyard one more time...

73
00:21:14,346 --> 00:21:19,245
I'm just gonna bank his little butt for
breakfast! You don't have any pets?

74
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,157
- No, I don't.
- They're allowed.

75
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:24,327
I just don't like them
in here for obvious reasons.

76
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:29,024
There was a man that lived here once
that had a prizefighting kangaroo.

77
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:34,623
You just wouldn't believe what that
kangaroo did to this courtyard.

78
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,798
Let’s go see your aunt’s apartment.
It’s a good one.

79
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:40,959
I can hardly wait.

80
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:52,372
- It’s unbelievable!
- I told you.

81
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:57,865
You and your aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

82
00:21:58,081 --> 00:22:00,548
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

83
00:22:00,758 --> 00:22:04,235
Everybody in this building is pretty
much okay with me...

84
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:06,736
or they wouldn't be here.

85
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:10,248
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

86
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:13,064
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

87
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:42,977
I'm sorry. My aunt Ruth didn't tell
me someone was gonna be here.

88
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,727
- I'm so sorry.
- It’s okay.

89
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:51,603
I'm Ruth's niece. My name is Betty.
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

90
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:56,233
There was an accident.
I came here.

91
00:23:56,446 --> 00:23:58,985
I understand. I saw the dress.

92
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:02,010
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

93
00:24:02,987 --> 00:24:04,825
What happened?

94
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:07,884
A car...

95
00:24:08,832 --> 00:24:10,908
a car accident.

96
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:14,952
Are you okay?

97
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,299
I think so.

98
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,937
I was just...

99
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,239
taking a shower.

100
00:24:24,454 --> 00:24:28,133
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'll let you get back to that.

101
00:24:28,352 --> 00:24:30,712
I'm gonna get unpacked.

102
00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:36,523
What’s your name?

103
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:44,171
I'm sorry, I'll get out of here.
We can talk later.

104
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:23,114
My name is...

105
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,270
Rita.

106
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:29,923
Do you work with my aunt?

107
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:34,205
- No, I...
- I'm sorry...

108
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,639
it's none of my business.

109
00:25:40,337 --> 00:25:42,282
She has pretty red hair.

110
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:44,858
She's letting me stay here while
she's working on a movie...

111
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:50,147
that's being made in Canada,
but I guess you already know that.

112
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:52,683
I couldn't afford a place like this
in a million years.

113
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,826
Unless, of course, I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

114
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,027
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star...

115
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:03,465
but sometimes people
end up being both. So...

116
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:07,051
that is, I guess you'd say,
the story of why I came here.

117
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:14,456
I'm sorry. I'm just
so excited to be here.

118
00:26:14,677 --> 00:26:19,162
I just came here from Deep River,
Ontario, and now I'm in this...

119
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:24,096
dream place!
Well, you can imagine how I feel.

120
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,951
Sit down.

121
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:40,344
Where were you hurt?

122
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:44,700
- We should call a doctor.
- No.

123
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:49,539
- But this could be serious.
- No, I need to sleep.

124
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,968
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't sleep.

125
00:26:52,186 --> 00:26:54,545
I'll be okay if I sleep.

126
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,305
I just need to lie down
here and sleep.

127
00:27:55,682 --> 00:27:59,537
You see, Adam, there
are some suggestions...

128
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:01,662
that ought to be brought forward.

129
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:04,901
And I know you said you would
entertain suggestions.

130
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,206
And that's all anybody
here is asking you to do.

131
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:13,178
- What are you talking about?
- An open mind.

132
00:28:14,086 --> 00:28:18,774
You're in the process of recasting
your lead actress, and I'm...

133
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:23,752
we are asking you to keep
an open mind.

134
00:28:34,198 --> 00:28:36,274
What was it the last time?

135
00:28:38,198 --> 00:28:43,405
- Okay, lets try the next one.
- He's not gonna like it.

136
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:45,701
We'll see.

137
00:28:53,508 --> 00:28:56,911
Castigliani brothers!
Let me introduce you around.

138
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:00,495
Please...

139
00:29:01,058 --> 00:29:04,284
take a seat. This is Mr. Darby,
whom you know.

140
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:07,763
And this is the director,
Adam Kesher.

141
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:11,588
And his manager,
Robert Smith.

142
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:48,261
She's very pretty.

143
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:53,032
May I offer you gentlemen anything?

144
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:57,933
- Espresso.
- Nothing.

145
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:01,486
- What's the photo for?
- One espresso.

146
00:30:03,128 --> 00:30:05,204
No, that's it.

147
00:30:05,424 --> 00:30:07,713
I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

148
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:10,179
I've done quite a bit of research...

149
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,929
knowing how hard
you are to please.

150
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:14,157
This one comes
highly recommended.

151
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:18,540
- What's the photo for?
- It's a recommendation.

152
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,361
A recommendation to you, Adam.

153
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,984
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

154
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:31,583
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

155
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,108
We'd be happy to put her on the
list for considerations.

156
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:40,734
You'd be pleased to know, there's
quite a bit of interest in this role.

157
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:46,092
Interest? There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

158
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:48,592
This is the girl.

159
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:51,969
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, hold on, Adam.

160
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:53,466
Hold on?

161
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:56,256
There's no way!
There's no way!

162
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:13,302
Napkin.

163
00:31:14,314 --> 00:31:15,939
Pardon?

164
00:31:16,158 --> 00:31:17,651
Napkin.

165
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:20,086
Of course.

166
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:22,165
Excuse me.

167
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:40,924
Is that all, sir?

168
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:41,673
- Shit.
- Sorry. That was highly recommended.

169
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:44,485
That is considered one of the finest
espressos in the world!

170
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:48,217
What's going on here? There is
no way that girl is in my movie!

171
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,913
- This is the girl.
- Hey, that girl is not in my film!

172
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:02,163
It's no longer your film.

173
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,228
This is the girl.

174
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:51,260
Castigliani brothers get out
of that limo?

175
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:53,729
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

176
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:56,790
- Yes.
- Leave that door open.

177
00:34:06,992 --> 00:34:08,724
Castigliani brothers?

178
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:10,707
Beat it, pal.

179
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,259
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

180
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,824
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

181
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:06,238
The director doesn't want her.

182
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:12,401
Do you want him replaced?

183
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:17,164
I know they said...

184
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,090
Then?

185
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:23,326
Then...

186
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:26,733
that means we should...?

187
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,363
Yes?

188
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:36,783
Shut everything down?
Is that something that...

189
00:35:39,192 --> 00:35:43,082
Do you want us to shut
everything down?

190
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:51,507
Then we'll shut everything down.

191
00:36:20,771 --> 00:36:24,484
Oh, man, that's unheard of.

192
00:36:24,702 --> 00:36:27,892
An accident like that, who could
have foreseen that, man?

193
00:36:30,616 --> 00:36:33,462
- It's unreal, right?
- Yeah.

194
00:36:34,756 --> 00:36:36,869
Unbelievable, man.

195
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,889
So, bro? God, you look good.

196
00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:49,436
- What have you been doing?
- You know, just...

197
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:51,309
doing some stuff
for this guy.

198
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:54,442
Are you making ends meet?

199
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,319
Hardly.

200
00:36:58,173 --> 00:37:01,648
I know, man, look at my digs.

201
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,506
Times are tough, bro.

202
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:09,749
Hey... man, it's not that bad.

203
00:37:10,906 --> 00:37:13,504
I hope you're not gonna
get in any trouble.

204
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:16,714
That was just a thing, man.
That story? That made you laugh!

205
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,267
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident!

206
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:26,728
Hey, so that's... that's it, huh?

207
00:37:26,946 --> 00:37:29,378
That's Ed's famous black book.

208
00:37:32,478 --> 00:37:34,980
The history of the world...

209
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,273
in phone numbers.

210
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:08,829
Oh, man!

211
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:24,241
Something bit me bad!

212
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,459
Hey, man!

213
00:39:15,674 --> 00:39:19,280
She's hurt real bad! Could you come
here and call on the phone, please?

214
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:23,849
She's hurt real bad! You gotta
come in here and call the hospital!

215
00:39:25,172 --> 00:39:29,691
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!
I can't do everything by myself!

216
00:39:50,327 --> 00:39:51,715
Hey, man.

217
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,993
Oh, man!

218
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:56,849
Aunt Ruth, I'll try. I'm gonna study
those lines until I know them...

219
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:59,243
inside out.

220
00:40:59,462 --> 00:41:02,581
Either right here on
this fabulous leather couch...

221
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:04,604
or I'll take them with
a coffee into the courtyard...

222
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:07,001
like a regular movie star.

223
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,072
I got a real shock to find your
friend Rita here.

224
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:13,306
She was in the shower
and I opened the door!

225
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:15,390
Rita!

226
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:17,615
What do you mean?

227
00:41:18,632 --> 00:41:20,744
She was in an accident.

228
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:24,606
Rita. Your friend.

229
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:28,790
No, Coco unlocked the door.

230
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:32,472
No, she didn't see her.

231
00:41:33,453 --> 00:41:35,565
She's sleeping.

232
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:40,713
I'm sure there's some explanation for
this. I don't think we have to do that.

233
00:41:43,197 --> 00:41:47,395
Please, don't worry. Aunt Ruth,
we don't need the police.

234
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:02,778
You're awake.

235
00:42:06,646 --> 00:42:08,449
I think I misunderstood.

236
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:12,099
I thought you knew my aunt
and that's why you were here.

237
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:15,750
I just talked to my aunt on the phone
and she wants me to call the police.

238
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:24,173
Rita?

239
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,844
I'm sorry, I...

240
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,355
What is it, Rita?

241
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:40,595
I thought when I woke up...
I thought sleep would do it.

242
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:43,491
What's wrong?

243
00:42:45,405 --> 00:42:47,766
I just don't know who I am.

244
00:42:48,328 --> 00:42:51,482
- What do you mean? You're Rita.
- No, I'm not.

245
00:42:52,432 --> 00:42:54,900
I don't know what my name is.

246
00:42:55,112 --> 00:42:57,366
I don't know who I am.

247
00:43:07,776 --> 00:43:11,596
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

248
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:15,805
You wanna know, don't you?

249
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,110
- Yes, but...
- Open it.

250
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:57,364
- Sure you don't want anything?
- Not here.

251
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,421
- Thanks.
- A drink or something?

252
00:44:59,637 --> 00:45:01,925
No. Thanks, though.

253
00:45:02,628 --> 00:45:05,510
I'll take a cigarette,
if you have one.

254
00:45:08,404 --> 00:45:10,977
Yeah, just reach inside my
shirt pocket there.

255
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:18,625
Any new girls on the street lately?

256
00:45:20,443 --> 00:45:21,795
No.

257
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,679
I haven't seen any.

258
00:45:26,044 --> 00:45:28,120
A brunette?

259
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,973
Maybe a little beat-up?

260
00:45:31,193 --> 00:45:32,688
No.

261
00:45:36,725 --> 00:45:40,309
- Keep your eyes open for me, okay?
- Sure.

262
00:45:41,353 --> 00:45:42,633
You bet you will.

263
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:47,778
That money...

264
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:52,724
you don't know where it came from?

265
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:59,577
When you think of them,
the money and the key...

266
00:46:01,568 --> 00:46:04,556
does it make you
remember anything?

267
00:46:06,577 --> 00:46:09,424
There's something...

268
00:46:10,336 --> 00:46:12,660
something...

269
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:15,651
there.

270
00:46:25,748 --> 00:46:27,278
What did you say?

271
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:31,071
- They fired everyone.
- Who fired everyone?

272
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:35,732
Ray did!
Wait! I'm talking on the phone.

273
00:46:36,152 --> 00:46:41,229
They closed the set. Everybody's
gone. You'd better get down here.

274
00:46:42,484 --> 00:46:44,073
No.

275
00:46:44,293 --> 00:46:46,867
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.

276
00:46:47,076 --> 00:46:48,666
I'm going home.

277
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:50,166
Home?

278
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:54,023
Meet me at the office, we gotta do
something. You gotta do something!

279
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:58,479
- I'm going home, Cynthia.
- Adam, this isn't like you.

280
00:46:58,697 --> 00:47:01,651
Please, come to the office. There's
gotta be something we can do!

281
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:03,808
I'm going home.

282
00:47:14,007 --> 00:47:16,676
I wonder where you were going.

283
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:23,121
Mulholland Drive.

284
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:30,003
Mulholland Drive?

285
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,419
That's where I was going.

286
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,556
Mulholland Drive.

287
00:47:38,778 --> 00:47:41,970
Maybe that's where
the accident was.

288
00:47:42,676 --> 00:47:45,866
There must be a police report.
We could call.

289
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:50,642
We could call anonymously just
to see if there was an accident.

290
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:57,002
It'll be just like in the movies!
We'll pretend to be someone else.

291
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,591
I wanna walk around, anyway.

292
00:48:00,803 --> 00:48:03,543
I'm in Hollywood and
I haven't even seen any of it.

293
00:48:04,038 --> 00:48:06,956
Come on, Rita,
do you feel up to it?

294
00:48:14,546 --> 00:48:16,171
Okay.

295
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,678
But just...

296
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,925
just to see.

297
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:26,995
Just to see if there was
an accident...

298
00:48:27,385 --> 00:48:30,017
on Mulholland Drive.

299
00:49:12,476 --> 00:49:14,279
Lorraine?

300
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:17,755
You're home?

301
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:22,669
Lorraine?

302
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,655
Now you've done it!

303
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:50,323
Just forget you ever saw it.
It's better that way.

304
00:49:53,601 --> 00:49:56,140
What the hell are you
even doing here?

305
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:10,539
What are you doing?

306
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:16,140
That's my jewelry!

307
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:37,852
- That bastard. You bastard!
- He's probably upset, Lorraine.

308
00:50:44,434 --> 00:50:46,449
What are you doing?

309
00:50:48,226 --> 00:50:49,779
Stop it!

310
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,353
Stop it!

311
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,613
Adam, stop it!

312
00:50:54,455 --> 00:50:56,115
Stop it!

313
00:50:56,508 --> 00:50:57,859
Stop it!

314
00:51:01,899 --> 00:51:04,496
You're hurting me! Gene!

315
00:51:04,717 --> 00:51:06,662
You're hurting me!

316
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:13,481
That ain't no way to treat your
wife. I don't care what she's done.

317
00:51:14,878 --> 00:51:17,095
Throw him out!

318
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:19,252
Throw him out!

319
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:22,078
Damn you, Adam!

320
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,438
Throw him out!

321
00:51:30,812 --> 00:51:32,472
Get out!

322
00:52:11,902 --> 00:52:13,978
Let's hide it.

323
00:52:59,151 --> 00:53:01,227
There's one.

324
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:19,984
- Los Angeles Police Department.
- I'm inquiring about an accident...

325
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:24,579
...last night on Mulholland Drive.
- I'll connect you to Traffic.

326
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:30,116
- Sergeant Baker.
- Hi, I'm inquiring...

327
00:53:32,204 --> 00:53:36,653
I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car crash.

328
00:53:36,867 --> 00:53:39,679
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

329
00:53:39,894 --> 00:53:41,946
Yes, there was.

330
00:53:42,155 --> 00:53:45,073
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.

331
00:53:45,286 --> 00:53:48,027
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?

332
00:53:54,855 --> 00:53:57,037
There was an accident.

333
00:53:57,255 --> 00:54:00,896
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident, Rita.

334
00:54:02,684 --> 00:54:05,115
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

335
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:07,648
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of
coffee and we can see.

336
00:54:11,868 --> 00:54:15,451
Maybe it happened so late it's
not in today's paper.

337
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,879
There's nothing?

338
00:54:19,071 --> 00:54:21,431
Not that I can see.

339
00:54:23,073 --> 00:54:24,496
That's okay.

340
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:30,999
Thanks.

341
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:34,407
Diane.

342
00:54:38,972 --> 00:54:41,676
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?

343
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:44,492
Rita, you want something?

344
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:51,005
- No, just... just the coffee.
- We'll take our check.

345
00:54:58,352 --> 00:55:00,428
What is it, Rita?

346
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:12,855
I remember something.
I remember something!

347
00:55:15,887 --> 00:55:19,327
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

348
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:21,937
Maybe that's my name!

349
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:30,464
"D. Selwyn." It's the only one.

350
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,136
I'm gonna call.

351
00:55:40,764 --> 00:55:44,868
- It is strange to be calling yourself.
- Maybe it's not me.

352
00:55:53,882 --> 00:55:55,542
Hello, it's me.

353
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,836
Leave a message.

354
00:56:00,005 --> 00:56:02,081
That's not my voice.

355
00:56:03,484 --> 00:56:06,155
But I know her!

356
00:56:07,555 --> 00:56:13,250
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's
voice. Maybe that's your roommate.

357
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,776
Or if it is Diane Selwyn,
she could tell you who you are.

358
00:56:19,106 --> 00:56:21,051
Maybe.

359
00:56:21,437 --> 00:56:23,655
Maybe, maybe...

360
00:56:57,762 --> 00:56:59,600
Adam Kesher?

361
00:57:03,084 --> 00:57:05,658
- Adam Kesher?
- Get lost!

362
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:08,371
- This is Adam Kesher's house.
- Like hell it is! Get out now!

363
00:57:08,581 --> 00:57:09,826
Get out!

364
00:57:12,026 --> 00:57:13,723
Adam Kesher?

365
00:57:18,984 --> 00:57:22,663
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

366
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:26,846
- Bastard.
- I guess you don't understand English.

367
00:57:27,057 --> 00:57:29,109
She said leave. Here's the door.

368
00:57:29,317 --> 00:57:30,705
Gene!

369
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,549
Get out!

370
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,744
Get out!

371
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,615
Adam Kesher?

372
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:06,265
- Yeah, what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher...

373
00:58:06,477 --> 00:58:09,989
but there seems to be some
problem with your credit cards.

374
00:58:10,895 --> 00:58:13,184
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

375
00:58:15,244 --> 00:58:19,313
Listen, two guys from
your bank came by.

376
00:58:19,976 --> 00:58:21,779
My bank?

377
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:25,536
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

378
00:58:27,005 --> 00:58:28,949
What'd they say?

379
00:58:29,162 --> 00:58:32,840
They said to tell you that you're
maxed out at your bank...

380
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:36,320
and that your line of credit
has been canceled.

381
00:58:38,104 --> 00:58:40,120
That's unbelievable.

382
00:58:41,757 --> 00:58:43,489
Well, look...

383
00:58:45,967 --> 00:58:50,867
I don't know what's going on.
That is so much baloney.

384
00:58:53,343 --> 00:58:59,143
- I got enough cash for you, Cookie.
- I know, I know. Don't worry.

385
00:58:59,952 --> 00:59:04,959
But I'm sorry, it's my duty
to inform you...

386
00:59:06,286 --> 00:59:11,008
listen, man,
whoever you're hiding from...

387
00:59:11,227 --> 00:59:13,896
they know where you are.

388
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:16,822
Right.

389
00:59:17,837 --> 00:59:19,819
I'm sorry.

390
00:59:43,409 --> 00:59:44,440
Hello?

391
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:48,408
- Someone maybe shut off my money.
- I know. Where are you, Adam?

392
00:59:48,768 --> 00:59:53,110
- Sorry, what do you mean you know?
- Somebody called...

393
00:59:53,326 --> 00:59:57,526
they told me you were as good as
broke. So I made a few calls.

394
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,001
- And?
- You're broke.

395
01:00:00,215 --> 01:00:01,568
I'm not broke!

396
01:00:02,094 --> 01:00:04,382
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

397
01:00:05,886 --> 01:00:10,158
- I'm at Cookie's, downtown.
- Do you know somebody called...

398
01:00:10,722 --> 01:00:12,418
"The Cowboy"?

399
01:00:13,436 --> 01:00:15,726
- "The cowboy"?
- Yeah.

400
01:00:16,323 --> 01:00:20,558
"The Cowboy". This guy,
the Cowboy, wants to see you.

401
01:00:20,777 --> 01:00:23,802
Jason said he thought
it would be a good idea.

402
01:00:24,709 --> 01:00:27,900
Jason thought it would be a good
idea for me to go see the Cowboy.

403
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:31,417
Should I wear my 1O-gallon hat
and my six-shooters?

404
01:00:31,842 --> 01:00:35,068
Something tells me that this guy
is connected to what's happening.

405
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,664
Adam, I think you should do it, and
you should do it right away.

406
01:00:40,088 --> 01:00:44,988
- What's going on, Cynthia?
- It's been a very strange day.

407
01:00:46,385 --> 01:00:48,982
And getting stranger.

408
01:00:50,595 --> 01:00:53,999
Where do I meet this Cowboy? Do you
have to ride out to the range?

409
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:59,218
Sort of, funny boy.
If I tell him the meeting's on...

410
01:00:59,641 --> 01:01:04,992
you'll go to the top of the Beachwood
Canyon, there's a corral up there...

411
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:08,577
...where he'll be.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

412
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:11,219
Will you meet with him?

413
01:01:11,436 --> 01:01:12,646
Yeah.

414
01:01:12,863 --> 01:01:16,931
Sure. This has been
that kind of a day. When?

415
01:01:17,245 --> 01:01:20,995
I'll call him right away
and then I'll call you back.

416
01:01:21,874 --> 01:01:26,002
You know, you could stay at
my place, if you wanted.

417
01:01:26,431 --> 01:01:31,580
- I don't think that'd be a good idea.
- I was just offering a place to stay.

418
01:01:31,791 --> 01:01:35,089
Yes, and I appreciate the offer,
Cynthia. I'll find a place.

419
01:01:35,304 --> 01:01:38,294
Just go on and give that cowboy
a yodel and get on back to me.

420
01:01:38,504 --> 01:01:42,051
Okay. But you don't know
what you're missing.

421
01:01:42,262 --> 01:01:45,216
Just get along, little doggie.
And call me back.

422
01:01:57,329 --> 01:02:01,433
It's right about here. Sierra Bonita.
It's not too far away.

423
01:02:02,859 --> 01:02:05,077
What's wrong with that?

424
01:02:05,886 --> 01:02:08,248
I'm not sure about this.

425
01:02:09,645 --> 01:02:12,705
I know you're afraid of something.

426
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:16,321
We'll be careful. I promise.

427
01:02:16,985 --> 01:02:20,568
Tomorrow. We'll go over there...

428
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,831
and we'll find out.

429
01:02:36,053 --> 01:02:38,270
It'll be okay.

430
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:43,043
It's probably Coco.

431
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:51,042
- Yes, may I help you?
- Someone is in trouble!

432
01:02:52,823 --> 01:02:55,148
Who are you?

433
01:02:55,884 --> 01:02:58,626
What are you doing
in Ruth's apartment?

434
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:03,463
She's letting me stay here.
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

435
01:03:03,678 --> 01:03:07,497
No, it's not!
That's not what she said.

436
01:03:07,957 --> 01:03:11,991
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!

437
01:03:12,968 --> 01:03:16,265
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who you are and...

438
01:03:16,482 --> 01:03:19,886
Louise?
What are you doing, Louise?

439
01:03:20,553 --> 01:03:25,179
I've been trying to get hold of you
since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

440
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:28,615
That one is in my room and
she won't leave!

441
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:31,894
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

442
01:03:32,659 --> 01:03:35,851
This is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

443
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:39,024
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

444
01:03:39,237 --> 01:03:44,480
I was on my way over here to see
Betty. Betty is a young actress.

445
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:48,731
I was delivering some faxed pages of
a scene for a big audition tomorrow.

446
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:51,755
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Thank you.

447
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:54,367
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.

448
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,596
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes. Come on.

449
01:03:56,807 --> 01:03:59,962
No, she said it was someone
else who was in trouble.

450
01:04:00,181 --> 01:04:04,072
Stop it, Louise!
I'm taking you home. Come on.

451
01:04:05,156 --> 01:04:07,445
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

452
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:10,264
Good night.

453
01:04:49,274 --> 01:04:51,292
Cowboy...

454
01:05:58,582 --> 01:06:01,772
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.

455
01:06:04,357 --> 01:06:06,646
Beautiful evening.

456
01:06:10,029 --> 01:06:13,670
Thank you for coming all the way
up here to see me from that...

457
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:15,908
nice hotel downtown.

458
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:20,569
No problem.
What's on your mind?

459
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:24,598
Well, now. Here's a man who
wants to get right down to it.

460
01:06:25,162 --> 01:06:27,939
Kind of anxious
to get to it, are you?

461
01:06:28,156 --> 01:06:29,993
Whatever.

462
01:06:31,461 --> 01:06:33,893
A man's attitude...

463
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:39,218
a man's attitude goes some ways
the way his life will be.

464
01:06:39,915 --> 01:06:42,453
Is that something
you might agree with?

465
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,987
Sure!

466
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:49,024
Did you answer because that's what
you thought I wanted to hear...

467
01:06:49,241 --> 01:06:51,293
or did you think about what I said...

468
01:06:51,501 --> 01:06:55,737
and answered 'cause you
truly believe that to be right?

469
01:06:56,512 --> 01:07:00,225
I agree with what you said. Truly.

470
01:07:02,322 --> 01:07:05,062
What'd I say?

471
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:10,877
That a man's attitude determines to
a large extent how his life will be.

472
01:07:12,481 --> 01:07:14,914
So since you agree...

473
01:07:15,126 --> 01:07:20,203
you must be a person who does not
care about the good life.

474
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:22,428
How's that?

475
01:07:23,963 --> 01:07:26,288
Well, stop for a little second...

476
01:07:26,538 --> 01:07:30,393
and think about it.
Can you do that for me?

477
01:07:32,626 --> 01:07:35,817
Okay. I'm thinking.

478
01:07:39,237 --> 01:07:44,872
No, you're not. You're too busy
being a smart aleck to be thinking.

479
01:07:45,639 --> 01:07:49,910
Now, I want you to think
and stop being a smart aleck.

480
01:07:50,128 --> 01:07:52,345
Can you try that for me?

481
01:07:52,563 --> 01:07:56,240
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

482
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:02,433
There's sometimes a buggy.
How many drivers does a buggy have?

483
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,597
One.

484
01:08:05,298 --> 01:08:08,560
So let's just say
I'm driving this buggy.

485
01:08:08,776 --> 01:08:13,427
And if you fix your attitude,
you can ride along with me.

486
01:08:15,736 --> 01:08:18,166
I want you to go back
to work tomorrow.

487
01:08:19,145 --> 01:08:25,018
You were recasting the lead actress.
Audition many girls for the part.

488
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:30,970
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say:

489
01:08:31,393 --> 01:08:34,346
"This is the girl."

490
01:08:34,697 --> 01:08:38,338
The rest of the cast can stay.
That's up to you.

491
01:08:39,254 --> 01:08:42,552
But that lead girl
is not up to you.

492
01:08:44,508 --> 01:08:49,028
Now, you will see me one more
time if you do good.

493
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:55,082
You'll see me two more times
if you do bad.

494
01:08:55,713 --> 01:08:57,302
Good night.

495
01:09:23,337 --> 01:09:27,157
- You're still here?
- I thought that's what you wanted.

496
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:31,443
- Nobody wants you here!
- Really?

497
01:09:31,653 --> 01:09:34,679
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left!

498
01:09:34,889 --> 01:09:38,958
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

499
01:09:39,411 --> 01:09:43,160
- But you won't.
- Lf you're trying to blackmail me...

500
01:09:43,866 --> 01:09:46,534
it's not going to work! You're
playing a dangerous game here.

501
01:09:46,753 --> 01:09:49,114
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

502
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:52,731
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad!

503
01:09:52,946 --> 01:09:55,971
He trusts you!
You're his best friend.

504
01:09:56,182 --> 01:09:58,329
This will be the
end of everything.

505
01:09:58,548 --> 01:10:01,395
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

506
01:10:01,609 --> 01:10:05,500
Stop! Just stop it! That's what
you said from the beginning.

507
01:10:06,341 --> 01:10:09,568
If I tell what happened, they'll
arrest you and put you in jail.

508
01:10:09,786 --> 01:10:12,218
Get out of here before...

509
01:10:13,091 --> 01:10:16,389
- Before what?
- Before...

510
01:10:16,605 --> 01:10:21,195
...I kill you.
- Then they'd put you in jail.

511
01:10:24,817 --> 01:10:28,221
Then I cry, cry, cry,
and then I say with big emotion...

512
01:10:28,435 --> 01:10:31,425
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

513
01:10:34,488 --> 01:10:38,202
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.

514
01:10:39,395 --> 01:10:41,648
Thank you, darling.

515
01:10:56,441 --> 01:10:59,074
Hi, there. Who are you?

516
01:11:02,252 --> 01:11:04,090
Betty?

517
01:11:10,914 --> 01:11:13,904
Betty, can I see you outside
for a minute?

518
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,871
What is it, Coco?

519
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,579
Your aunt called.

520
01:11:33,113 --> 01:11:34,606
I was afraid of that.

521
01:11:34,818 --> 01:11:37,699
She wants to know who's
staying in her apartment.

522
01:11:38,645 --> 01:11:41,527
It's just for a night or two.
Until she finds her own place.

523
01:11:41,741 --> 01:11:44,101
I tried to explain that to aunt Ruth
but the connection was bad...

524
01:11:44,315 --> 01:11:47,411
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

525
01:11:47,622 --> 01:11:49,459
I kept telling her
that it was my friend Rita...

526
01:11:49,675 --> 01:11:51,963
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

527
01:11:53,222 --> 01:11:57,291
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco, she's very nice.

528
01:11:57,502 --> 01:11:59,305
Honey, you're a good kid...

529
01:11:59,522 --> 01:12:02,676
but what you're telling me is
a load of horse puckey.

530
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,606
Even though it
comes from a good place.

531
01:12:05,818 --> 01:12:08,249
I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

532
01:12:09,019 --> 01:12:12,210
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

533
01:12:12,776 --> 01:12:16,382
Louise Bonner said there is trouble
in there, remember last night?

534
01:12:16,987 --> 01:12:20,593
Well, sometimes she's wrong...

535
01:12:20,814 --> 01:12:25,085
but if there is trouble,
get rid of it.

536
01:12:34,696 --> 01:12:36,748
Is everything all right?

537
01:12:36,957 --> 01:12:42,165
- Is it bad for you that I'm here?
- No, no, everything is A-Okay.

538
01:12:42,385 --> 01:12:47,592
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.
And my audition is in one hour!

539
01:13:07,506 --> 01:13:09,937
I hope I'm back
in a couple of hours.

540
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:13,383
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck.

541
01:13:13,595 --> 01:13:17,484
When I get back, I'll keep the
cab waiting, so be ready to go.

542
01:13:47,797 --> 01:13:48,934
"Voilà!"

543
01:13:49,813 --> 01:13:52,660
Betty Elms, I would
like you to meet...

544
01:13:52,876 --> 01:13:55,057
Jack Tutman, my assistant.

545
01:13:56,147 --> 01:13:59,242
Woody Katz, who we have
cast in the part of Chuck...

546
01:13:59,452 --> 01:14:01,777
and will do the scene with you.

547
01:14:02,513 --> 01:14:04,589
Bob Rooker, our director...

548
01:14:04,809 --> 01:14:06,827
and Julie Chadwick.

549
01:14:07,385 --> 01:14:11,418
Now, our surprise guest,
Lynne James.

550
01:14:11,629 --> 01:14:14,690
Alas, we can't afford her to
cast our show but...

551
01:14:14,899 --> 01:14:19,064
well, as casting agents go,
she is the best.

552
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:22,751
Why, thank you, Wally.
Hello, Betty.

553
01:14:23,215 --> 01:14:26,999
- Very pleased to meet you.
- This is my assistant, Nikki.

554
01:14:27,807 --> 01:14:33,228
And the ever lovely Martha. Martha
Johnson, whom you met out front.

555
01:14:35,602 --> 01:14:36,882
Hi.

556
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:41,191
So, shall we give it a go?

557
01:14:41,969 --> 01:14:45,717
Would you like a water,
a coffee before we begin?

558
01:14:45,934 --> 01:14:47,808
No, I'm fine.

559
01:14:48,022 --> 01:14:51,012
Well then,
let's everyone take a seat.

560
01:14:54,075 --> 01:15:00,197
Betty, why don't you join Woody
over there and we'll play the scene.

561
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:03,398
Bob, do you have anything
you wish to say?

562
01:15:04,131 --> 01:15:06,764
Something to Betty
before we begin?

563
01:15:06,984 --> 01:15:09,487
No. It's not a contest.

564
01:15:10,811 --> 01:15:12,580
The two of them...

565
01:15:13,491 --> 01:15:16,029
with themselves.

566
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:20,406
So don't play it for real...

567
01:15:20,624 --> 01:15:23,540
until it gets real.

568
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:30,323
Okay.

569
01:15:30,957 --> 01:15:33,211
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

570
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:34,495
What?

571
01:15:34,715 --> 01:15:38,392
I wanna play this one nice and close
like we did with that other girl...

572
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:42,191
what's her name? With the black
hair. It felt good, what do you think?

573
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:46,568
That's good, Woody. Just don't rush
that line again. I told you...

574
01:15:46,788 --> 01:15:49,563
the line where you say:
"Before what?"

575
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:56,454
Bobby, acting is reacting.
I just play off them. They all say:

576
01:15:57,155 --> 01:16:00,145
"They're gonna arrest you", like
that, and: "They'll put you in jail."

577
01:16:00,357 --> 01:16:03,726
They say it the same way.
So when they say it, I just react.

578
01:16:03,942 --> 01:16:05,257
- What's your name?
- Betty.

579
01:16:05,471 --> 01:16:10,514
Betty, look. You don't rush it,
I don't rush it, okay?

580
01:16:10,725 --> 01:16:16,455
Now, we're gonna play this nice and
close just like in the movies, okay?

581
01:16:19,215 --> 01:16:22,061
Dad's best friend goes to work.

582
01:16:23,217 --> 01:16:24,745
Bob?

583
01:16:27,078 --> 01:16:28,607
And...

584
01:16:29,409 --> 01:16:31,141
action!

585
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,025
You're still here.

586
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:40,052
I came back.

587
01:16:40,508 --> 01:16:43,769
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- Nobody wants you here.

588
01:16:43,987 --> 01:16:45,482
Really?

589
01:16:45,693 --> 01:16:49,798
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

590
01:16:50,006 --> 01:16:51,738
So, surprise!

591
01:16:52,339 --> 01:16:57,344
- I can call them, I can call my dad.
- But you won't.

592
01:17:13,387 --> 01:17:16,376
You're playing a dangerous
game here.

593
01:17:17,736 --> 01:17:20,405
If you're trying to blackmail me...

594
01:17:20,867 --> 01:17:23,299
it's not gonna work.

595
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:29,143
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

596
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:33,873
Get out.

597
01:17:35,828 --> 01:17:38,462
Get out before I call my dad.

598
01:17:39,342 --> 01:17:42,854
He trusts you. You're his...

599
01:17:43,831 --> 01:17:45,848
best friend.

600
01:17:49,746 --> 01:17:52,558
This will be the end
of everything.

601
01:17:54,895 --> 01:17:58,643
What about you? What'll
your dad think about you?

602
01:17:59,245 --> 01:18:01,189
Stop.

603
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,696
Stop it.

604
01:18:05,159 --> 01:18:07,971
That's what you said from
the beginning.

605
01:18:09,368 --> 01:18:13,711
If I tell them what happened, they
will arrest you and put you in jail.

606
01:18:20,885 --> 01:18:22,997
So get out of here...

607
01:18:23,217 --> 01:18:25,020
before...

608
01:18:28,435 --> 01:18:30,689
Before what?

609
01:18:48,685 --> 01:18:50,737
Before...

610
01:18:51,364 --> 01:18:54,104
I kill you.

611
01:19:08,586 --> 01:19:11,468
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

612
01:19:19,999 --> 01:19:22,430
I hate you.

613
01:19:23,408 --> 01:19:25,591
I hate us both.

614
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:44,140
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

615
01:19:48,181 --> 01:19:50,648
Well, there it was.

616
01:19:51,311 --> 01:19:56,212
Yeah, there it was, all right. Baby,
you got a way with you. Really.

617
01:19:57,157 --> 01:19:58,367
Bob?

618
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:02,783
Very good. Really.

619
01:20:03,351 --> 01:20:09,365
I mean, it was forced maybe,
but still humanistic.

620
01:20:11,595 --> 01:20:14,170
Very good. Really!

621
01:20:14,692 --> 01:20:16,460
Really.

622
01:20:21,861 --> 01:20:27,032
Oh, I thank you, Betty.
And I really mean that, sincerely.

623
01:20:27,252 --> 01:20:28,878
I mean, it was...

624
01:20:29,098 --> 01:20:31,007
extraordinary.

625
01:20:31,498 --> 01:20:33,372
You've done your aunt proud today.

626
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:37,334
I'm going to tell
her that first chance I get.

627
01:20:37,552 --> 01:20:41,893
Now, you and I are going
to speak again very soon.

628
01:20:42,563 --> 01:20:45,861
- Thank you, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you, Wally.

629
01:20:46,077 --> 01:20:49,861
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk
about. We'll walk Betty out.

630
01:20:50,077 --> 01:20:53,517
Yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Lynne.

631
01:20:53,731 --> 01:20:58,144
Don't you be a stranger around here.
We'd love to have you here.

632
01:20:58,357 --> 01:21:01,168
- Come on, Betty.
- Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

633
01:21:01,384 --> 01:21:04,611
And it was nice meeting
all of you.

634
01:21:05,177 --> 01:21:06,386
Bye.

635
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,655
Bye!

636
01:21:14,118 --> 01:21:17,036
She's a slam-dunk! Where
the hell did you find her?

637
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:19,745
God, that was awful!

638
01:21:20,729 --> 01:21:25,107
Not you, Betty. You were stellar,
and I mean that. But poor Wally.

639
01:21:25,322 --> 01:21:29,628
He'll never get that picture made.
Wally's days were up 2O years ago.

640
01:21:29,845 --> 01:21:32,941
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

641
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:35,202
And the cast they have
so far is terrible.

642
01:21:35,412 --> 01:21:39,896
Oh, God, terrible!
That poor old fool Wally.

643
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:43,715
He was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

644
01:21:43,937 --> 01:21:46,570
And Wally... Mr. Brown is a very
close friend of my aunt's.

645
01:21:46,789 --> 01:21:49,886
Don't get me wrong, I love Wally.

646
01:21:50,095 --> 01:21:53,120
I ought to, I was married
to him for 1O years.

647
01:21:53,504 --> 01:21:59,234
And I love actors. All actors.
We just get a little catty sometimes.

648
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:02,821
We want to take you across and
introduce you to a director...

649
01:22:03,037 --> 01:22:04,770
who's a head above the rest.

650
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:07,311
He's got a project
you will kill for.

651
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:10,335
Knock right out of the park!

652
01:22:12,084 --> 01:22:14,895
Sixteen reasons

653
01:22:15,111 --> 01:22:20,841

Of sixteen reasons

666
01:23:07,058 --> 01:23:12,337
Why I love you

667
01:23:13,771 --> 01:23:17,106

Of sixteen reasons

677
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:51,591

Sixteen reasons

679
01:23:56,358 --> 01:24:01,400
Why I love you

680
01:24:03,422 --> 01:24:08,108
- Cut it! Thank you very much, Carol.
- Checking the gate?

681
01:24:08,327 --> 01:24:10,865
Checking the gate! Thank you.
We'll tell you what happens next!

682
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:14,160
Thank you very much for coming in.
I know how busy you are.

683
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:17,263
Are you kidding me? I loved the script.
Just show me where to sign.

684
01:24:17,478 --> 01:24:20,431
I love you, but there's no way they're
gonna let me cast this thing...

685
01:24:20,644 --> 01:24:23,004
until I've seen everyone. I'll let
you know as soon as I can.

686
01:24:23,218 --> 01:24:27,940
I know you will. Because my manager
is gonna be bugging you. And me!

687
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,219
- My pleasure. Now get outta here.
- You're so cruel to me.

688
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:34,241
- I'm the girl who's playing this part.
- I'll see you later.

689
01:24:36,175 --> 01:24:37,978
Hank? Where's Hank?

690
01:24:38,472 --> 01:24:40,939
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

691
01:24:42,297 --> 01:24:44,694
- Is she ready?
- All ready.

692
01:24:45,604 --> 01:24:48,486
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes, next.

693
01:24:54,754 --> 01:24:58,361
"Sylvia North Story".
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

694
01:24:58,965 --> 01:25:01,431
Okay, here we go.
Let's lock it up, please.

695
01:25:02,166 --> 01:25:04,526
- Roll sound, please.
- That's fit.

696
01:25:04,741 --> 01:25:06,614
Playback and action.

697
01:25:20,572 --> 01:25:22,931
Why haven't I told you?

698
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:26,618
Oh, baby, I told

699
01:25:26,833 --> 01:25:28,636
Every little star

700
01:25:28,852 --> 01:25:33,122
Just how sweet I think you are

701
01:25:33,339 --> 01:25:37,610
Why haven't I told you?

702
01:25:38,315 --> 01:25:42,586
- Get Jason over here.
- Cindy, Adam wants to see Jason.

703
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:48,746
Made my heart an open book

704
01:25:49,414 --> 01:25:54,042
Why haven't I told you?

705
01:25:56,964 --> 01:26:00,713
Friends ask me
Am I in love

706
01:26:00,931 --> 01:26:04,785
I always answer “yes"

707
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:08,856
Might as well confess

708
01:26:09,072 --> 01:26:12,618
If the answer's yes

709
01:26:13,003 --> 01:26:17,001
Maybe you may love me too

710
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:21,176
Oh, my darling, if you do

711
01:26:21,632 --> 01:26:25,072
- Why haven't you told me?
- Did you want to tell something?

712
01:26:35,897 --> 01:26:38,008
This is the girl.

713
01:26:43,065 --> 01:26:45,603
Excellent choice, Adam.

714
01:26:57,017 --> 01:26:58,961
Oh, my goodness.

715
01:27:08,568 --> 01:27:10,584
I have to be somewhere.

716
01:27:10,795 --> 01:27:13,083
I promised a friend.

717
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,567
- I'm sorry, I must go.
- Now?

718
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:44,046
Should be around here.

719
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:47,287
259O. That's it.

720
01:27:47,675 --> 01:27:50,486
Up there!
Does it look familiar?

721
01:27:59,436 --> 01:28:01,937
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?

722
01:28:02,323 --> 01:28:05,727
- Those men, in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?

723
01:28:07,124 --> 01:28:09,795
Keep going.
Go around to the back.

724
01:28:58,548 --> 01:29:01,289
Selwyn, number 12.

725
01:29:24,956 --> 01:29:27,352
Now you got me scared.

726
01:29:51,677 --> 01:29:53,064
You see?

727
01:29:53,278 --> 01:29:56,303
I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of.

728
01:30:58,131 --> 01:30:59,519
Betty, wait. Wait!

729
01:31:02,062 --> 01:31:03,557
Don't.

730
01:31:30,036 --> 01:31:32,503
No one's home.

731
01:31:32,715 --> 01:31:34,341
Yes?

732
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:37,546
Diane?

733
01:31:39,292 --> 01:31:41,403
Number 17.

734
01:31:43,188 --> 01:31:45,726
But it said number 12.

735
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,483
I switched apartments with her.

736
01:31:49,693 --> 01:31:53,549
She's in 17.
It's down at the end, on the left.

737
01:31:58,184 --> 01:32:01,101
But she hasn't been around
for a few days.

738
01:32:03,228 --> 01:32:05,518
We'll leave her a note.

739
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:07,715
I'll go with you.

740
01:32:09,735 --> 01:32:12,202
She still got some of my stuff.

741
01:32:17,634 --> 01:32:20,550
You go ahead.
I gotta get that.

742
01:32:35,551 --> 01:32:39,193
- Guess you're not Diane Selwyn.
- Guess I'm not.

743
01:33:16,816 --> 01:33:19,556
There's still no one home, I guess.

744
01:33:48,964 --> 01:33:51,562
- What are you doing?
- Come on, help me in.

745
01:33:52,721 --> 01:33:55,355
Come on, I'll open the front door.

746
01:33:56,132 --> 01:33:57,721
No!

747
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,022
Come on.

748
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:10,184
Come on!

749
01:36:35,727 --> 01:36:38,502
I know what you're doing.

750
01:36:59,038 --> 01:37:01,954
I know what you have to do.

751
01:37:04,118 --> 01:37:06,929
But let me do it.

752
01:37:15,113 --> 01:37:17,994
Let me do it.

753
01:37:40,337 --> 01:37:43,563
You look like someone else.

754
01:38:05,248 --> 01:38:07,158
Good night, Betty.

755
01:38:07,371 --> 01:38:10,147
You don't have to wear
that in the house.

756
01:38:10,502 --> 01:38:12,091
What?

757
01:38:12,311 --> 01:38:14,115
The wig!

758
01:38:14,330 --> 01:38:19,714
I was just looking at myself again.
I'll take it off to sleep.

759
01:38:20,384 --> 01:38:22,851
You don't have
to sleep on that couch.

760
01:38:23,062 --> 01:38:27,226
- No, it's okay.
- No, it's not. This is a huge bed.

761
01:38:27,586 --> 01:38:29,662
Come on, just get in
and get a good night sleep.

762
01:39:01,856 --> 01:39:05,191
It's more comfortable than
the couch, isn't it?

763
01:39:14,416 --> 01:39:16,563
Thank you, Betty.

764
01:39:17,269 --> 01:39:21,991
It's nothing. I shouldn't have let
you sleep on the couch last night.

765
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:24,013
No, I mean...

766
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:27,002
thank you for everything.

767
01:39:31,257 --> 01:39:32,881
You're welcome.

768
01:39:43,051 --> 01:39:45,518
Good night, sweet Betty.

769
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:57,271
Good night.

770
01:40:39,103 --> 01:40:41,772
Have you ever done this before?

771
01:40:43,208 --> 01:40:45,285
I don't know.

772
01:40:45,505 --> 01:40:47,094
Have you?

773
01:41:01,231 --> 01:41:04,148
I want to with you.

774
01:41:29,726 --> 01:41:32,752
I'm in love with you.

775
01:41:46,739 --> 01:41:49,730
I'm in love with you.

776
01:42:15,861 --> 01:42:18,672
Silence.

777
01:42:19,479 --> 01:42:21,840
Silence.

778
01:42:23,272 --> 01:42:25,810
Silence.

779
01:42:26,752 --> 01:42:29,421
There's no band.

780
01:42:30,405 --> 01:42:33,003
There's no band.

781
01:42:33,884 --> 01:42:36,695
There's no orchestra.

782
01:42:38,233 --> 01:42:40,345
Silence!

783
01:42:55,524 --> 01:42:58,586
- Rita?
- There's no band.

784
01:42:59,144 --> 01:43:01,504
Rita, wake up!

785
01:43:05,406 --> 01:43:07,030
It's okay. It's okay.

786
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:09,268
No, it's not okay.

787
01:43:10,207 --> 01:43:12,569
What's wrong?

788
01:43:13,305 --> 01:43:16,010
Go with me somewhere.

789
01:43:17,445 --> 01:43:20,884
It's two o'clock. It's two
o'clock in the morning.

790
01:43:24,543 --> 01:43:27,568
Go with me somewhere.

791
01:43:27,778 --> 01:43:29,795
Sure.

792
01:43:30,006 --> 01:43:31,500
Now?

793
01:43:33,242 --> 01:43:35,186
Right now.

794
01:45:09,408 --> 01:45:12,433
There's no band!

795
01:45:13,305 --> 01:45:16,401
There is no band!

796
01:45:21,447 --> 01:45:23,356
This is all...

797
01:45:23,986 --> 01:45:26,383
a tape recording.

798
01:45:26,596 --> 01:45:29,550
There's no band, and yet...

799
01:45:30,387 --> 01:45:32,891
we hear a band.

800
01:45:33,415 --> 01:45:36,512
If we want to hear
a clarinet...

801
01:45:37,069 --> 01:45:38,943
listen...

802
01:45:52,621 --> 01:45:55,813
A muted trombone.

803
01:46:09,843 --> 01:46:13,698
A muted trumpet.

804
01:46:31,311 --> 01:46:34,336
It's all recorded.

805
01:46:36,739 --> 01:46:39,693
There's no band!

806
01:46:41,054 --> 01:46:42,997
It is all...

807
01:46:43,594 --> 01:46:45,954
a tape.

808
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:03,007
It is an illusion.

809
01:47:07,809 --> 01:47:09,647
Listen!

810
01:48:23,066 --> 01:48:29,152
Ladies and gentlemen,
let Club Silencio introduce to you...

811
01:48:29,606 --> 01:48:32,347
"La Llorona de Los Angeles".

812
01:48:32,563 --> 01:48:35,790
Rebekah del Rio.

813
01:48:55,423 --> 01:48:58,864
I was all right

814
01:48:59,076 --> 01:49:02,138
For a while

815
01:49:02,346 --> 01:49:08,848
I could smile for a while

816
01:49:09,062 --> 01:49:12,466
But I saw you last night

817
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:16,678
You held my hand so tight

818
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:23,842
As you stopped to say hello

819
01:49:24,266 --> 01:49:28,893
You wished me well and you

820
01:49:29,102 --> 01:49:32,364
Couldn't tell

821
01:49:32,582 --> 01:49:38,277
That I've been crying

822
01:49:38,497 --> 01:49:41,486
Over you

823
01:49:41,698 --> 01:49:45,137
Crying

824
01:49:45,351 --> 01:49:47,947
Over you

825
01:49:48,482 --> 01:49:54,355
Since you said “so long"

826
01:49:54,919 --> 01:50:01,420
I've been miserable and alone

827
01:50:01,843 --> 01:50:05,698
Lonesome and crying

828
01:50:06,226 --> 01:50:09,180
Crying

829
01:50:09,602 --> 01:50:12,936
Crying

830
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:15,652
Crying

831
01:50:15,865 --> 01:50:22,566
It's hard to understand

832
01:50:22,787 --> 01:50:29,289
That upon seeing you again

833
01:50:29,503 --> 01:50:33,775
I'd be crying

834
01:50:34,512 --> 01:50:37,633
I thought

835
01:50:37,854 --> 01:50:40,950
That I was over you

836
01:50:41,158 --> 01:50:48,111
But it's true, so true

837
01:50:48,327 --> 01:50:51,802
I love you even more

838
01:50:52,015 --> 01:50:55,561
Much more than I did before

839
01:50:55,771 --> 01:51:01,645
But darling, what can I do

840
01:51:01,861 --> 01:51:07,697
You don't love me anymore

841
01:51:07,914 --> 01:51:14,867
And I will always be

842
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:22,038
Crying over you

843
01:51:22,248 --> 01:51:28,334
Crying over you

844
01:51:28,547 --> 01:51:34,834
Your love has captured

845
01:51:35,052 --> 01:51:40,853
The whole of my heart

846
01:51:41,072 --> 01:51:44,821
That was left crying

847
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:48,300
Crying

848
01:51:48,517 --> 01:51:51,673
Crying

849
01:51:51,893 --> 01:51:55,333
Crying

850
01:53:16,071 --> 01:53:18,123
Betty?

851
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:22,882
Betty?

852
01:53:34,963 --> 01:53:37,776
Where are you?

853
01:56:20,890 --> 01:56:22,730
Hey, pretty girl.

854
01:56:23,709 --> 01:56:25,653
Time to wake up.

855
01:58:02,765 --> 01:58:05,824
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

856
01:58:06,487 --> 01:58:09,441
My lamp and dishes.

857
01:58:11,253 --> 01:58:14,172
Come on, Diane,
it's been three weeks.

858
01:58:16,543 --> 01:58:19,638
I put your dishes in that box.

859
01:58:39,575 --> 01:58:43,216
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

860
01:58:54,988 --> 01:58:59,330
- Anytime.
- I'm just making sure, Diane.

861
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:10,878
This is it?

862
01:59:16,491 --> 01:59:20,037
By the way, those two detectives
came by again looking for you.

863
02:00:14,003 --> 02:00:16,114
Camilla!

864
02:00:18,699 --> 02:00:20,989
You've come back.

865
02:02:02,452 --> 02:02:05,442
What was that you were saying,
beautiful?

866
02:02:05,967 --> 02:02:07,733
I said...

867
02:02:08,192 --> 02:02:10,932
you drive me wild.

868
02:02:23,503 --> 02:02:25,933
We shouldn't do this anymore.

869
02:02:32,304 --> 02:02:34,665
Don't say that.

870
02:02:39,367 --> 02:02:42,286
Don't ever say that.

871
02:02:42,499 --> 02:02:44,408
Don't, Diane!

872
02:02:44,621 --> 02:02:46,080
Stop it!

873
02:02:46,291 --> 02:02:47,951
Diane, stop!

874
02:02:49,110 --> 02:02:51,816
I've tried to tell you this before.

875
02:03:00,313 --> 02:03:02,567
It's him, isn't it?

876
02:03:14,161 --> 02:03:17,459
I'm not trying to show you how
to do the scene, but just...

877
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:21,744
watch me and I think you'll
understand what I'm getting at.

878
02:03:26,268 --> 02:03:29,566
Don't sit so rigid, just...

879
02:03:29,782 --> 02:03:31,276
just relax.

880
02:03:32,148 --> 02:03:36,276
Now, the two of you are alone
and it's real comfortable.

881
02:03:37,924 --> 02:03:40,557
Like you've known
each other forever.

882
02:03:40,777 --> 02:03:44,075
Even if you don't say anything,
it's real comfortable.

883
02:03:45,787 --> 02:03:49,263
Hank, can you just clear the set?
There's too many people around here.

884
02:03:49,476 --> 02:03:52,358
- Let's get this worked out.
- Clear the set!

885
02:03:52,572 --> 02:03:55,168
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

886
02:03:56,225 --> 02:03:59,487
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?

887
02:03:59,704 --> 02:04:03,250
Yeah, sure, Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay!

888
02:04:03,462 --> 02:04:05,265
Diane!

889
02:04:10,664 --> 02:04:14,032
Now, when she starts to cry,
don't pull her towards you.

890
02:04:16,162 --> 02:04:20,990
Let her fall into you.
Just let her fall.

891
02:04:24,965 --> 02:04:27,017
And when you kiss her...

892
02:04:28,583 --> 02:04:31,571
it's just a continuation
of that move.

893
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:36,052
There's no break.

894
02:05:00,975 --> 02:05:03,192
Kill the lights!

895
02:05:13,569 --> 02:05:16,346
Don't be mad.
Don't make it be like this.

896
02:05:16,561 --> 02:05:20,203
Oh, sure, you want me to make
this easy for you.

897
02:05:20,424 --> 02:05:23,270
No fucking way!
It's not gonna be!

898
02:05:24,043 --> 02:05:26,581
- It's not easy for me!
- Diane!

899
02:06:50,712 --> 02:06:53,973
Hello, it's me.
Leave a message.

900
02:06:56,696 --> 02:06:58,428
Diane?

901
02:07:02,959 --> 02:07:05,876
- Hello?
- Diane?

902
02:07:07,481 --> 02:07:08,904
Camilla.

903
02:07:09,117 --> 02:07:13,007
Diane, the car's waiting.
Are you okay?

904
02:07:13,953 --> 02:07:16,206
You coming?

905
02:07:21,677 --> 02:07:25,948
Good. It means so much to me.

906
02:07:26,687 --> 02:07:30,328
Go on. The car's right
outside your house.

907
02:07:30,759 --> 02:07:33,534
It's been waiting, okay?

908
02:07:37,821 --> 02:07:39,624
Okay.

909
02:07:39,838 --> 02:07:43,802
It's 698O, Mulholland Drive.

910
02:07:44,744 --> 02:07:46,927
Mulholland Drive.

911
02:08:56,349 --> 02:08:59,718
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

912
02:09:04,595 --> 02:09:06,647
A surprise.

913
02:09:29,575 --> 02:09:31,415
Shortcut.

914
02:09:33,993 --> 02:09:36,497
Come on, sweetheart.

915
02:09:41,823 --> 02:09:43,767
It's beautiful.

916
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:46,305
A secret path.

917
02:10:54,017 --> 02:10:56,201
Perfect timing.

918
02:10:56,906 --> 02:10:59,052
Welcome, Diane.

919
02:11:04,665 --> 02:11:08,210
Well...
Here's to love.

920
02:11:18,755 --> 02:11:21,601
Here's to love.

921
02:11:26,376 --> 02:11:28,523
Here she is!

922
02:11:37,091 --> 02:11:39,939
I don't believe
you met my mother.

923
02:11:40,641 --> 02:11:43,071
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

924
02:11:43,285 --> 02:11:46,962
Just call me Coco, everybody
does. Pleased to meet you.

925
02:11:47,355 --> 02:11:50,274
Well, let's eat!
I'm starving!

926
02:11:56,609 --> 02:11:58,722
I'm sorry I was late.

927
02:12:19,156 --> 02:12:21,790
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

928
02:12:22,357 --> 02:12:26,141
- A small town.
- So you rolled in here from Canada.

929
02:12:29,002 --> 02:12:31,778
I always wanted to come here.

930
02:12:32,587 --> 02:12:35,777
I won this jitterbug contest.

931
02:12:36,483 --> 02:12:39,639
That sort of led to acting.

932
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:43,645
You know, wanting to act.

933
02:12:44,346 --> 02:12:46,813
When my aunt died...

934
02:12:47,999 --> 02:12:50,953
Anyway, she left me some money.

935
02:12:51,688 --> 02:12:54,392
- She worked here.
- In the movies?

936
02:12:55,514 --> 02:12:56,902
Yes.

937
02:12:58,367 --> 02:13:00,693
How did you meet Camilla?

938
02:13:02,473 --> 02:13:06,327
- On the "Sylvia North Story".
- Camilla was great in that.

939
02:13:06,544 --> 02:13:09,498
I never went to
Casablanca with Luigi.

940
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:12,343
- What a pity!
- Then go!

941
02:13:21,958 --> 02:13:24,874
I wanted the lead so bad.

942
02:13:26,307 --> 02:13:29,710
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

943
02:13:32,848 --> 02:13:34,792
The director...

944
02:13:35,004 --> 02:13:36,949
Bob Rooker?

945
02:13:37,161 --> 02:13:38,929
Yes.

946
02:13:41,477 --> 02:13:44,288
He didn't think so much of me.

947
02:13:48,469 --> 02:13:51,316
Anyway, that's when
we became friends.

948
02:13:52,889 --> 02:13:54,442
She helped me...

949
02:13:54,975 --> 02:13:58,071
getting some parts in some
of her films.

950
02:14:00,404 --> 02:14:02,456
I see.

951
02:14:17,313 --> 02:14:21,476
So I got the pool,
and she got the pool man.

952
02:14:23,853 --> 02:14:27,780
I couldn't believe it. I wanted
to buy that judge a Rolls Royce.

953
02:14:34,396 --> 02:14:37,171
Sometimes, good things happen.

954
02:15:30,865 --> 02:15:33,605
So I guess we've saved
the best for last.

955
02:15:37,058 --> 02:15:40,463
- Do you want to tell them?
- No, you tell them.

956
02:15:44,225 --> 02:15:46,657
Camilla and I...

957
02:15:58,803 --> 02:16:00,607
are going to be...

958
02:16:13,209 --> 02:16:15,261
Sorry about that.

959
02:16:22,741 --> 02:16:24,852
No, I'm fine.

960
02:16:30,569 --> 02:16:33,144
This is the girl.

961
02:16:34,152 --> 02:16:37,070
Don't show me this
fucking thing here.

962
02:16:37,771 --> 02:16:41,033
It's just an actress' photo
resume. Everybody's got one.

963
02:16:42,642 --> 02:16:45,074
You got the money?

964
02:16:45,288 --> 02:16:47,364
I sure do.

965
02:16:58,579 --> 02:17:02,292
Okay, now, once you hand that over
to me, it's a done deal.

966
02:17:05,745 --> 02:17:08,283
You sure you want this?

967
02:17:13,121 --> 02:17:16,039
More than anything in this world.

968
02:17:26,620 --> 02:17:29,681
When it's finished, you'll find
this where I told you.

969
02:17:43,461 --> 02:17:46,272
What's it open?

970
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,502
Silencio.
