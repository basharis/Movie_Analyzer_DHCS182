1
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,055
Once upon a time, a long time ago,

2
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,576
a king and queen had a
beautiful daughter named Fiona.

3
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,334
But she was possessed
by a terrible curse.

4
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,937
By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.

5
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,739
Only true love's kiss
could lift her curse.

6
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,893
So Fiona waited in a tower,
guarded by a dragon, until the day

7
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,654
when her true love would arrive.

8
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,050
But as the days turned into years,

9
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,008
the King and Queen were forced
to resort to more desperate measures.

10
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,452
Whoa, there.

11
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,412
I don't know about this, Lillian.

12
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,732
Fairy Godmother said only true love's
kiss could break Fiona's curse.

13
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,013
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.

14
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,172
Besides, he does come
highly recommended by King Midas.

15
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,777
But to put our daughter's life
in the hands of this... person?

16
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,456
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...

17
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,895
Rumpelstiltskin!

18
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,059
Mrs. Highness.

19
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,013
How do you do?

20
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,532
Down, Fifi. Get down!

21
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,858
As you can see, everything's in order.

22
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,569
So you'll put an end
to our daughter's curse?

23
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,892
And, in return, you sign the kingdom
of Far Far Away over to me.

24
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,693
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?

25
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,250
Fiona has been locked away
in that tower far too long.

26
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,411
It's not like she's getting any younger.

27
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,140
But to sign over our entire kingdom?

28
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,098
Well, if your kingdom's worth
more to you than your daughter...

29
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,730
Nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter.

30
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,533
Jump, Fifi, jump!

31
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,135
Just sign it and all your problems
will disappear.

32
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,617
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!

33
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,853
Who saved her?

34
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,253
No one would have guessed
that an ogre named Shrek,

35
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,411
whose roar was feared
throughout the land,

36
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,140
would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.

37
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,133
True love's kiss led to marriage
and ogre babies!

38
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,292
The kingdom of Far Far Away
was finally at peace.

39
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,658
Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!

40
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,853
Sir? You're gonna
have to pay for that.

41
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,614
Maybe we could make a deal
for it, little boy?

42
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,329
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?

43
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,972
Nobody needs your deals
anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!

44
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,096
I wish that ogre was never born!

45
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,776
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!

46
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,537
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

47
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,013
Better out than in.

48
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,849
That's my line.

49
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,853
Did my little Fergus make a...

50
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,137
...big, grownup ogre stink?!

51
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,372
Oh, that's diabolical!

52
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,492
And on your left, the lovable lug
that showed us you don't have to

53
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,935
change your undies
to change the world!

54
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,136
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.

55
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,451
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!

56
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,571
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge,
through the loop...

57
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,015
...and finally, into the castle.

58
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,449
Play date!

59
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,256
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.

60
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,376
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

61
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,529
Happily...

62
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,099
- Ever...
- After.

63
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,728
Look! A shooting star!

64
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,771
So, what did you wish for?

65
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,931
That every day could be like this one.

66
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,499
Come here, you.

67
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,248
Morning, Daddy.

68
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,489
Morning.

69
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,775
Better out than in.

70
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,652
Did my little Fergus make a...

71
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,816
Cute. Real cute.

72
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,655
This lovable lug taught us

73
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,618
you don't have to change
your undies to change the world!

74
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,689
Play date!

75
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,614
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!

76
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,613
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

77
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,769
- Happily...
- Ever...

78
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,929
After?

79
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,655
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.

80
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,453
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...

81
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,699
- Play date!
- No!

82
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,654
Outhouse again!

83
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,855
Come on.

84
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,735
Undies!

85
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,535
Outhouse!

86
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,736
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...

87
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,299
- Happily...
- Ever...

88
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,654
After.

89
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,574
Roar.

90
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,213
Nice landing, baby.

91
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,655
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.

92
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,535
Happy birthday, niños!
Vamos a la fiesta!

93
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,378
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!

94
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,014
Mr. Shrek, would you
sign our pitchforks?

95
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,215
And our torches?

96
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,018
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!

97
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,932
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!

98
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,931
A real ogre?

99
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,818
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!

100
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,972
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.

101
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,418
Why does being your best friend entail
me doing everything I don't want to do?

102
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,810
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.

103
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,174
Excuse me, Mr. Shrek?

104
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,410
Could you do that
ogre roar of yours for my son?

105
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,013
He's a big, big fan.

106
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,249
Do the roar.

107
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,093
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.

108
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,171
- Do the roar.
- Honey?

109
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,614
Why don't you go check on the cake?

110
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,011
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.

111
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,169
Hold still.

112
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,217
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.

113
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,133
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!

114
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,619
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!

115
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,372
Your cake. Voilà!

116
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,692
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!

117
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,135
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.

118
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,450
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!

119
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,133
I'm in a great mood, actually.

120
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,053
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!

121
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,335
As long as you're not doing anything,

122
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,899
how about one of those
famous Shrek roars?

123
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,494
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.

124
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,094
An ogre only roars when he's angry.

125
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,251
You don't want to see me angry, do you?

126
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,648
Do it.

127
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,817
Hold it together. Just hold it together.

128
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,971
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.

129
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,368
Oh, good.

130
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,896
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.

131
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,573
- You licked it!
- No.

132
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,493
Just because you're an ogre,
doesn't mean you have to eat like one.

133
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,855
Looks like you forgot the candles!

134
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,170
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.

135
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,568
Watch the cake?

136
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,250
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.

137
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,455
- Ya.
- What?

138
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,814
No, don't cry.

139
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,369
Hey! I believe you
promised my son a roar.

140
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,893
- Do the roar.
- Roar.

141
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,255
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.

142
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,139
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.

143
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,609
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!

144
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,374
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?

145
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,337
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.

146
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,615
No, I ate them.

147
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,374
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!

148
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,418
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?

149
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,457
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.

150
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,772
We need the cake!

151
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,290
Cake! Cake! Cake!

152
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,775
I love you, Daddy.

153
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,534
Everybody, I have found another cake!

154
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,776
Shrek? Are you OK?

155
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,452
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...

156
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,817
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.

157
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,858
Is this really how you want
to remember the kids' first birthday?

158
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,854
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?

159
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,976
Let's talk about this
after the party, at home.

160
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,734
You mean that roadside
attraction we live in?

161
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,212
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!

162
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,373
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!

163
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,658
OK, OK, maybe you're not
the ogre you used to be.

164
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,458
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.

165
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,135
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.

166
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,495
You spent half your life in a palace.

167
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,094
And the other half
locked away in a tower.

168
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,334
Look, all I want is for things to go
back to the way they used to be!

169
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,051
Back when villagers were afraid of me,
and I could take a mud bath in peace.

170
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,656
When I could do what I wanted,
when I wanted to do it!

171
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,051
Back when the world made sense!

172
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,780
You mean back before you
rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?

173
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,259
Exactly!

174
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,933
Shrek, you have
three beautiful children,

175
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,170
a wife who loves you,

176
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,219
friends who adore you.
You have everything.

177
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,778
Why is it the only person
who can't see that is you?

178
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,332
That's just great.

179
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,251
If she thinks I'm gonna
slink back there and apologize,

180
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,617
she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.

181
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,455
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize
for acting like one.

182
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,772
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!

183
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,612
Please, help!

184
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,573
Please, help!

185
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,658
I'm stuck! Help!

186
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,572
Oh, please, help!

187
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,413
Someone, anyone! Help me!

188
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,936
The pain! I can see
a bright light. A tunnel!

189
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,458
Grandma? Is that you?

190
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,939
Yeah, it's me, Granny.

191
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,536
An ogre! Please, Mr. Ogre,
please don't eat me!

192
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,179
I'm not gonna eat you.

193
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,491
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?

194
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,379
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.

195
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,849
Look, move out or get crushed.

196
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,931
So you're not gonna eat me?

197
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,730
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl
of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

198
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,898
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?

199
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,049
Nowhere.

200
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,780
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.

201
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,252
But, seriously,
letme give you a ride. I insist.

202
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,618
Come on. It's the least I can do
after all you've done for me.

203
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,573
I got a hot rat cooking.

204
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,975
AII right! Can I interest you
in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?

205
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,973
A liquid libation
to ease that frustration?

206
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,258
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.

207
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,974
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about."

208
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,574
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.

209
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,937
To live the life of an ogre...
no worries, no responsibilities.

210
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,739
You are free to pillage
and terrorize as you please.

211
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,051
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?

212
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,569
Sometimes I wish I had just one day
to feel like a real ogre again.

213
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,809
Why didn't you say so?

214
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,017
Magical transactions are my specialty!

215
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,729
Great. Next to mimes,
magicians are my favourite people.

216
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,093
Hold on.

217
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,297
"King for a Month."
"Knight for a Week."

218
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,451
Ogre for a day.

219
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,976
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.

220
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,129
You'll be, like, "Roar!"

221
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,736
And the villagers will be, like, "Get
away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"

222
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,131
It would be just like the good old days,
when your swamp was your castle.

223
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,693
- When the world made sense.
- AII right, what's the catch?

224
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,375
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.

225
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,531
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.

226
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,578
AII right, I knew it.
So what do you want?

227
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,492
- A day.
- A day.

228
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,649
Rat's done!

229
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,177
To make the magic work, you gotta
give something to get something.

230
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,138
In this case, you gotta
give a day to get a day. That's all.

231
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,894
I can't just pick up
and leave my family.

232
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,575
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.

233
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,492
No one will even know you're gone.

234
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,212
And by the time this day is up,
you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.

235
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,051
Still, I don't know.

236
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,610
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.

237
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,169
Do you like white meat or dark meat?

238
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,258
So what day would I have to give up?

239
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,173
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.

240
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,649
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?

241
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,129
A day some meddling oaf
stuck his nose where it didn't belong

242
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,858
destroying your business
and ruining your life?!

243
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,779
Just for an example.

244
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,612
How about the day I met Donkey?

245
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,169
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.

246
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,259
I don't know who that is.

247
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,528
I know. What about a day
you wouldn't even remember?

248
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,816
Like a day when you were a baby.

249
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,008
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.

250
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,378
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.

251
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,260
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.

252
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,890
I guess there's nothing wrong
with wanting a little time for myself.

253
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,539
Just 24 tiny little hours.

254
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,691
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!

255
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,010
I never needed to ask
for anyone's permission before.

256
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,740
So why start now?

257
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,459
Go on, Shrek.

258
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,099
Sign it!

259
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,539
Go on, Shrek.

260
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,099
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!

261
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,969
You signed it.

262
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,813
So, tell me. What happens now?

263
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,572
Have a nice day.

264
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,129
I think I fell on my keys.

265
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,528
There are 40 children in that shoe,

266
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,411
which is why the weasel
goes pop to this very day.

267
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,569
Oh, great.

268
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,129
As we head over the river
and through the woods...

269
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,289
Ogre!

270
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,253
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!

271
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,573
This is the part where you run away!

272
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,649
Sure is great to be wanted again.

273
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,373
Nice one.

274
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,019
Fiona?

275
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,213
Oh, no.

276
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,212
My home.

277
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,774
Fiona!

278
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,579
Fiona! Are you in there?!

279
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,810
AII right, Rumpel!

280
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,849
This wasn't part of the deal!

281
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,493
Rumpel!

282
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,976
Ogre!

283
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,217
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!

284
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,292
Who are you?!

285
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,371
What are you doing in my swamp?

286
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,496
Looks like a troublemaker!

287
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,768
Spread 'em!

288
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,936
Nice job, ladies!

289
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,298
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!

290
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,974
You have the right to shut your mouth!

291
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,096
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?

292
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,174
Donkey!

293
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,529
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?

294
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,737
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.

295
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,853
I'm driving,
so I'm in charge of the music.

296
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,699
Will you witches make up your mind?

297
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,576
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?

298
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,774
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me
in trouble and I need this job.

299
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,532
I am not going back to work
for OId MacDonald.

300
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,373
Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That's what I said.

301
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,089
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?

302
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,979
Look, I think you have me confused
with some other talking donkey.

303
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,459
I've never seen you before in my life.

304
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,088
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!

305
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,330
And how do you
know my name anyway?

306
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,253
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?

307
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,253
A donkey and an ogre friends?

308
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,570
That's the most
ridiculous thing I ever heard!

309
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,689
Can you at least tell me
where they're taking me?

310
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,897
To the same place they take
every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.

311
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,618
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!

312
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,334
Oh, no.

313
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,740
It's time to crumble!

314
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,052
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!

315
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,209
Yeah!

316
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,539
Gingy?

317
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,092
Gingy snap!

318
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,569
There's one!

319
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,378
Disgusting, filthy ogre!

320
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,214
Hideous monster!

321
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,938
Filthy, filthy creature!

322
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,295
Disgusting creature!

323
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,938
Move it!

324
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,979
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.

325
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,177
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard
on mine, Captain Crazy!

326
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,532
Mr. Stiltskin?

327
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,536
You got another customer.

328
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,289
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.

329
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,212
Bring me my business wig.

330
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,496
Mr. Stiltskin, please!

331
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,655
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!

332
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,051
Go away! Terms are
in the details, balsa boy.

333
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,859
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!

334
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,694
Stiltskin!

335
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,055
Shrek!

336
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,339
There he is!

337
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,653
So close!

338
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,213
Have I been waiting for you!

339
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,449
Ladies, this is the guy

340
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,851
that made all of this possible!

341
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,334
So, tell me, how are you
enjoying your day?

342
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,492
AII right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?

343
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,697
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.

344
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,489
Thanks to you, the King and Queen
signed their kingdom over to me.

345
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,013
They would never do that.

346
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,617
They would if I promised them
all their problems would disappear.

347
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,290
And then they disappeared!

348
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,579
They would have done anything

349
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,776
if they thought it would
end their daughter's curse.

350
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,215
I ended Fiona's curse!

351
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,577
How could you when you never existed?

352
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,618
You better start making sense,
you dirty little man!

353
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,975
Here, letme spell it out for you!

354
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,292
You gave me a day from your past,
a day you couldn't even remember.

355
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,499
A day when you were
an innocent, mindless little baby.

356
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,493
You took the day I was born.

357
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,538
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.

358
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,090
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin,
because when this day is up...

359
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,854
But you haven't heard the best part.

360
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:32,492
Since you were never born, once
this day comes to an end, so will you.

361
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,938
Where's Fiona?

362
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,769
Where's my family?

363
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,012
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?

364
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,614
You see, you were never born.

365
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,816
You never met Fiona.

366
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,416
Your kids don't exist.

367
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,252
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?

368
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,329
Looks like you got
exactly what you wanted!

369
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,417
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!

370
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,568
Get him, witches!

371
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,777
You know what'd help morale
around here? Flip-flop Fridays.

372
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,500
Feet be comfortable
with the breeze on your toes.

373
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,812
Come on, girls!

374
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,569
Lock all the doors,
you worthless witches! Do it!

375
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,818
I'll be right back, Donkey!

376
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,256
I don't know you! I don't know him!

377
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,851
I'm glad I'm not you.

378
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,614
Help me! Help!

379
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,769
Help!

380
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,339
No, not my pretty ball!

381
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,372
Watch out!

382
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,009
Wolfie?

383
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,410
My angry wig.

384
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,932
Help! I've been kidnapped
by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!

385
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,453
Donkey! Get off of me!

386
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,418
Watch it with your pointy hooves!

387
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,738
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!

388
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,811
I'm being ass-napped!

389
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,535
Animal cruelty! Help!

390
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,691
You need to calm down!

391
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,975
I'm your friend.

392
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,691
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

393
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,417
Good. I'm gonna letgo...

394
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,935
...right... now.

395
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,534
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!

396
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,055
Donkey! You've got to trust me.

397
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,688
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...

398
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,851
Because...

399
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,654
OK.

400
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,013
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?

401
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,740
I've never seen an ogre cry.

402
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,658
I'm not crying.

403
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,776
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.

404
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,738
Just thinking about my grandma,
or thinking about baby kittens,

405
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,052
or my grandma kissing a baby kitten,
or a little baby grandma kitten.

406
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,173
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!

407
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,137
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.

408
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,052
It's none of my business
why you're upset.

409
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,294
By the way, why are you upset?

410
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,213
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.

411
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,575
You signed up for one of them
time-shares, huh?

412
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,300
No. I signed this.

413
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,329
You should never sign a contract
with Rumpelstiltskin!

414
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,774
Yeah, I got that.

415
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,851
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.

416
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,250
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...

417
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,415
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.

418
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,695
Used to be, you had to guess his name,

419
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,691
but now everybody knows
who Rumpelstiltskin is.

420
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,418
Donkey, I've read the fine print.

421
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,810
There's nothing
about an exit clause in here.

422
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,811
Well, you didn't expect him
to make it easy for you.

423
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,130
Here, letme show you how it's done.

424
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,733
I didn't spend all that time
around them witches

425
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,492
without picking up a few tricks.

426
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,776
Your tiny, little ogre brain
couldn't begin to comprehend

427
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,135
the complexity
of my polygonic foldability skills.

428
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,494
What are you doing?

429
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,618
Hey, I can't get my origami on
unless you back off.

430
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,931
Thank you. OK, here's what you
gotta do. You fold this piece here,

431
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,375
make this letter match up here,
bring this corner here,

432
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,533
and if you do it just right,
it will show you what to do. There!

433
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,930
"Try Lou's Bliss."

434
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,809
Who's Lou?

435
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,698
Give me that!

436
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,776
"True Love's Kiss."

437
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,369
You have to take me to dinner first.

438
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,217
"According to fairy tale law,
if not fully satisfied,

439
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,736
true love's kiss will render
this contract null and void."

440
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,256
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!

441
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,016
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!

442
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,978
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?

443
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,939
Well, that's just it, you see.

444
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,899
I don't know.

445
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,130
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.

446
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,530
So... where did you leave her last?

447
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,250
The last time I saw her,

448
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,980
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.

449
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,892
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?

450
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,528
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!

451
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,736
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!

452
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,731
They keep dragons in there!

453
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,893
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!

454
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,858
I'm gonna just hang back here
and find us some breakfast!

455
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,414
Fiona!

456
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,772
Oh, no.

457
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,455
If I didn't save Fiona...

458
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,938
...then who did?

459
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,656
This is the favour Fiona was
supposed to give me on the day we met.

460
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,176
It's a symbol of our love.

461
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,049
Now smell it!

462
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,017
Hey, man, get that dirty
favour out of my face!

463
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,570
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife,

464
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,208
so stop complaining and start smelling.

465
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,779
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!

466
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,578
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?

467
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,049
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!

468
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,859
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog,
not Donkey!

469
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,339
And another thing...

470
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,699
Wait a minute.

471
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,693
I think I got something.

472
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,495
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.

473
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,218
Luscious and tasty.

474
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,814
Hey! That's my wife
you're talking about.

475
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,375
Donkey!

476
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,211
Yeah! Waffles!

477
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,213
And I thought the Waffle Fairy
was just a bedtime story.

478
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,176
Sticky stacks of golden,
syrupy deliciousness!

479
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,410
Donkey! Don't eat that!

480
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,539
There's a stack of freshly made waffles
in the middle of the forest.

481
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,497
Don't you find that
a wee bit suspicious?

482
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,290
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?

483
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,337
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.

484
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,379
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.

485
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,249
You did.

486
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,169
Look out!

487
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,129
Donkey!

488
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,609
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

489
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,735
Donkey.

490
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,653
Help! Help me!

491
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,459
Help, Shrek! Help!

492
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,409
Watch your head.

493
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,894
Hey, it's a new guy!

494
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,096
Look at him, all dressed up
in his Sunday vest.

495
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,932
He's really tiny, isn't he?

496
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,091
Yeah. Fate has delivered us
a comrade-in-arms

497
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,818
and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!

498
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,857
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!

499
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,372
- Hey!
- Here you go.

500
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,133
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?

501
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,736
We fight for freedom
and ogres everywhere!

502
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,378
I didn't know we could do that.

503
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,929
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!

504
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,378
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.

505
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,849
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.

506
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,090
Trust me, you don't want
to eat this one.

507
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,216
I go down smooth,
but come out fighting!

508
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,371
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.

509
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,575
Your dinner is my friend!

510
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,776
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!

511
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,851
- She's back.
- There she is.

512
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,015
Fiona!

513
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,051
I'm so happy I found you!

514
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,219
Maybe you missed orientation,

515
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,736
but for future reference,
personal space is very important to me.

516
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,732
You don't know who I am, do you?

517
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,333
No.

518
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,411
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.

519
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,650
Gather the others
and meet me in the war room.

520
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,209
Gretched, make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight.

521
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,257
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

522
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,777
OK, I know you don't
remember me, but...

523
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,931
...we're married. Hear me out.

524
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,739
And at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet,

525
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,253
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks,

526
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,376
and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar."

527
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,849
Then I punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing I knew,

528
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,250
my donkey fell in your waffle hole.

529
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,089
Right? Who's with me?

530
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,294
I guess I must have kicked him
harder than I thought.

531
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,576
Fiona, I need to...

532
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,409
Witches! AII right, everyone,
you know the drill!

533
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,332
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!

534
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,491
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.

535
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,893
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.

536
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,496
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.

537
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,057
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.

538
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,372
Well, I see who wears the chain mail
in your family!

539
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,210
Some people like to look
at the goblet as... as half empty.

540
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,214
Me, I like to look at it as half full.

541
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,012
We've gone from the bottom
to the top, ladies.

542
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,172
But we're not just an empire.

543
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,894
We're a family.

544
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,409
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?

545
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,569
Good.

546
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,812
Yeah, you know, we have
put away a lot of ogres.

547
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,973
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.

548
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,451
It doesn't matter to me.

549
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,259
It's not like it's the end of the world.

550
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,178
Except... funny thing.

551
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,696
Now that I think about it,
the ogre who got away is Shrek!

552
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,579
And if he shares a kiss
with Fiona by sunrise,

553
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,777
it is the end of the world! Our world!

554
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,737
My empire!

555
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,495
But, as I was saying,

556
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,539
I like to look at the goblet
as half full.

557
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,851
Yelling makes me so parched.

558
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,695
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?

559
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,613
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...

560
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,817
...of agua purificada?

561
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,210
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?

562
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,091
Well, then does anyone care to tell me

563
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,774
what it's going to take
to get this ogre? You.

564
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,009
Faster brooms?

565
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,693
- No!
- Pointier hats?

566
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,418
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire

567
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,218
a professional bounty hunter?

568
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,053
What a world! What a world!

569
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,418
You know, actually
not a bad idea. Baba!

570
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,578
I need a bounty hunter.

571
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,777
And if music doth
soothe the savage beast...

572
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,012
...then I think I might know
just the person!

573
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:55,333
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.

574
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,537
Stiltskin is leading
tonight's ogre hunt himself.

575
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,338
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?

576
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,252
I bet that's because of us.

577
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,092
If that cupcake-eating clown

578
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,252
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest...

579
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,128
...he'll be vulnerable.

580
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,337
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route,

581
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,536
they'll reach the river by midnight.

582
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,056
We'll be concealed along this road,
waiting for his caravan.

583
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,417
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.

584
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,377
And then we attack!

585
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,017
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?

586
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,408
That's my chimichanga stand.

587
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,530
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.

588
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,249
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be
really hungry after this ambush, OK?

589
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,858
Go and finish your little speech.

590
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,890
AII right, as I was saying,
when the smoke clears,

591
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,609
Rumpelstiltskin is gone
and the chimichangas have been eaten.

592
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,294
Far Far Away will finally be free.

593
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,132
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.

594
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,417
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.

595
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,776
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.

596
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,408
How am I ever gonna
get her to kiss me before sunrise?

597
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,059
Actually, I was talking
about the revolution.

598
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,653
Revolution?

599
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,651
Why don't you just
tell her what you told me?

600
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,334
About how you're her true love and
you came from an alternate universe.

601
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,218
Well, while I'm at it,
why don't I tell her

602
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,291
that you're married
to a fire-breathing dragon

603
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,372
and you have little, mutant
donkey-dragon babies.

604
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,975
I do?!

605
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,938
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

606
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,249
I'm a daddy?

607
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,651
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...

608
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,298
...then I can do it again.

609
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,256
Shrek, do my babies
have hooves or talons?

610
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,933
Donkey...!

611
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,453
Hello?

612
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,975
Fiona?

613
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,698
You should not be here, señor.

614
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,179
Puss?

615
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,098
You've gotta be kidding me.

616
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,735
Feed me, if you dare.

617
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,097
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...

618
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,298
-...fancy.
- Do I know you?

619
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,928
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?

620
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,772
Your wee little boots?

621
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,295
Boots? For a cat? Ha!

622
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,418
But you're Puss in Boots.

623
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,533
Maybe once.

624
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,179
But that is a name I have outgrown.

625
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,932
That's not the only thing
you've outgrown.

626
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,013
Hey! I may have letmyself go
a little since retirement,

627
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,648
but hanging up my sword
was the best decision of my life.

628
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,732
I have all the cream I can drink
and all the mice I can chase.

629
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,619
I'll get him later.

630
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,089
Puss, what have I done to you?

631
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,659
You've gone soft.

632
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:59,413
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.

633
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,098
Look, it's not too late to fix it.

634
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,410
AII you have to do is help me
get a kiss from Fiona.

635
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,572
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?

636
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,573
Well, I know how stressful
mounting a rebellion can be...

637
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,651
...rallying the troops,
planning attacks,

638
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,449
so I brought you a little something
to ease the tension.

639
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,015
A gift basket?

640
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,694
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.

641
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,135
Heart-shaped box of slugs.

642
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,095
Skunk-scented candle.

643
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,458
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!

644
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,576
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage."

645
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,970
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...

646
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,530
"Good for one free kiss."
Let's cash it now.

647
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,611
Look, I don't know
what this is all about,

648
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,259
but I'm trying to run a revolution.

649
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,536
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,

650
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,736
I suggest you take your gift basket,

651
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,449
get out of my tent
and go make yourself useful!

652
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,218
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.

653
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,292
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?

654
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:00,849
An apologetic hug?

655
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,248
And a quick kiss goodbye.

656
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,689
Hey!

657
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,330
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?

658
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,211
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do
they make people feel uncomfortable?

659
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,372
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?

660
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,579
Have the years of prim
and pampery made me soft?

661
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,538
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?

662
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,179
I am.

663
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,134
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.

664
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,369
Honk.

665
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,053
AII right, Piggies, be gone!

666
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,336
Don't forget to take
her little potty box with you.

667
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,137
This little piggy wants to go home!

668
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,451
- Mr. Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.

669
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,697
Pied Piper. How was your commute?

670
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,735
Good.

671
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,572
You call this guy a bounty hunter?

672
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,493
What's he gonna do,
flute those ogres a lullaby?

673
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,538
OK, got it!

674
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,736
Make it stop!

675
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,179
AII right, that's enough.

676
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,895
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.

677
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,619
Griselda, seriously,
it's time to pay the piper.

678
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,692
Now go get my cheque book!
Go! Move! Get out!

679
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,771
Things are getting
real sloppy around here!

680
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,812
Here, now make sure they eat up!

681
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,131
You can't end tyranny on
an empty stomach! Go on! Go!

682
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,733
Din-din!

683
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,933
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?

684
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,295
AII right, but this is the last time.

685
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,769
Here it comes. Look at him.

686
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,652
I see you!

687
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,097
That's quite a friend you've got there.

688
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,296
I can see why you haven't eaten him.

689
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,974
Donkey! I hate to pull you away
from your adoring public,

690
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,335
but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.

691
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,458
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?

692
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,096
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.

693
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,058
Just another gift from some
clueless lover boy.

694
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,372
That's a good one, Cookie!

695
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,218
Anyone who knows Fiona knows
this stuff ain't gonna work on her.

696
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,813
Works on me.

697
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,733
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.

698
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,131
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.

699
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,178
- To the cause!
- To the cause!

700
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,375
AII right!

701
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:31,889
Hello!

702
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,731
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?

703
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,494
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.

704
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,220
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes

705
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:47,373
and do some scrunches
before an operational... op.

706
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,529
This one taken?

707
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,452
We use that to clean the toilets.

708
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,292
And we use that one to clean
the thing we clean the toilets with.

709
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,688
I knew that.

710
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,809
There you go, chief.

711
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,330
Hey... Scott?

712
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,572
My name is Shrek, actually.

713
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:22,459
You're going to get yourself killed
at the ambush tonight.

714
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:26,090
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...

715
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,774
Well, let's see about that.

716
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,535
Hey! Hey... Hey!

717
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,689
What the...?

718
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,494
Fiona?

719
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,968
I got it.

720
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,574
Give me your hand.

721
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,458
The dragon goes under the bridge,

722
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,770
through the loop and finally...

723
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,453
Into the castle.

724
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,014
Wow.

725
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,696
OK. Good.

726
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,938
It seems like you can handle yourself.

727
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,977
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!

728
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,018
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!

729
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,936
AII right, let's get those axes
sharpened and weapons packed!

730
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,613
Preparation is half the battle!

731
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,018
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!

732
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,934
Ogre, ogre, un momento!

733
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,728
Just give me a minute.

734
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,619
Look, Puss, I'm a little
pressed for time.

735
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,817
I am not believing
what I have just witnessed.

736
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,572
Back there, you and Fiona.

737
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,300
There was a spark...
a spark inside her heart

738
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,098
I thought was long extinguished.

739
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,492
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!

740
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,857
I am her true love. I ended her curse.

741
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,172
You know of her curse?

742
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,491
By day, one way, by night another.

743
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,299
This shall be the norm.

744
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,816
Until you find true love's first kiss...

745
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:43,769
...and then take love's true form.

746
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,417
You even know the little rhyme!

747
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,969
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!

748
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,210
- How?
- Convince her!

749
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,654
Go to her when she is alone

750
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,335
and tell her something
that only her true love would know.

751
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,979
Know about what?!

752
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,494
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?

753
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,692
Excuse me. Coming through!

754
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,454
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.

755
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,373
Look, Donkey,
the chimichanga cart! Quick!

756
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,293
Ándale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vámonos!

757
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,496
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!

758
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,935
And you are ri-donkey-lous!

759
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,253
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.

760
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,897
Secure your positions!

761
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,014
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!

762
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,169
Get back in position!

763
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:11,298
You need to know,
once and for all, who I really am.

764
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,859
You are going to ruin everything!

765
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,170
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...

766
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,934
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.

767
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,052
How do you know about my curse?!

768
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:25,452
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.

769
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,054
I can explain everything.

770
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,093
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?

771
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,979
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.

772
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,129
Listen, I don't know who you are
or how you know about my curse,

773
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,097
but if any of these ogres
find out I'm...

774
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,377
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.

775
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,452
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.

776
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,212
I know everything about you.

777
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:18,258
I know you sing so beautifully
that birds explode.

778
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,490
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,

779
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,220
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?

780
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,291
I know that when
you see a shooting star,

781
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,371
you cross your fingers on both hands,

782
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:31,169
squinch up your nose
and you make a wish.

783
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:34,093
I know that you don't like the covers
wrapped around your feet,

784
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,852
and I know that you sleep by candlelight

785
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,931
because every time
you close your eyes...

786
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,818
...you're afraid you're gonna
wake up back in that tower.

787
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,496
But, most importantly, Fiona...

788
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,896
...I know that the reason
you turn human every day...

789
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,091
...is because you've
never been kissed...

790
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,529
...well...

791
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,055
...by me.

792
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:12,974
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.

793
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,970
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?

794
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,132
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!

795
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,939
No, I can't stop myself!

796
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,819
Please! Make it stop!

797
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,050
I can't control myself!

798
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,732
Yeah! Cookie's bringing
the heat out of the kitchen!

799
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,255
Oh, no! It's the Piper!

800
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:44,810
I can't believe I letthis happen,
and it's all because of you!

801
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,212
- If you'd just letme kiss you!
- What? You're insane!

802
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:07,453
We must do something before
they fandango themselves into oblivion!

803
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,896
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!

804
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,654
When somebody tooties that fluty,
I got to shake my booty!

805
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,378
Then it's up to me!

806
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:27,255
Hurry! We must get them
away from the music!

807
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,458
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!

808
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,489
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?

809
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,695
Say what?!

810
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,894
No. Hell...

811
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:08,172
I don't care how big your eyes get,
player, it's not going down.

812
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,735
AII right!

813
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,209
Stop!

814
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,735
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.

815
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,619
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.

816
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,008
Puss, say something.

817
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,977
- Puss?
- Let me explain.

818
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,176
That's how you knew so much about me.

819
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:30,298
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?

820
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,018
It's the only way to save your friends.

821
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,169
Get out of my way.

822
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:36,332
You used to believe that a single kiss
could solve everything!

823
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,899
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

824
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,574
True love's kiss
was supposed to fix everything!

825
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,731
Yeah, you know,
that's what they told me, too.

826
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,130
True love didn't get me
out of that tower.

827
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,894
I did. I saved myself.

828
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:20,330
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.

829
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,809
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!

830
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,299
How would you know?

831
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:27,054
Did you grow up locked away
in a dragon's keep?

832
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,939
Did you live all alone
in a miserable tower?

833
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,330
Did you cry yourself
to sleep every night,

834
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,968
waiting for a true love
that never came?!

835
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:39,656
But... But I'm your true love.

836
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:43,096
Then where were you
when I needed you?

837
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,849
Maybe you kissed her wrong?

838
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,449
No.

839
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,698
The kiss didn't work...

840
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,850
...because Fiona doesn't love me.

841
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,778
Don't despair, fellow ogres!

842
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:16,013
They can put us in cages,
but they can't cage our honour!

843
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:20,138
Shrek and Fiona are together?!

844
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,257
Yeah, I've heard enough of
your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!

845
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,012
Wolfie! My speech wig.

846
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:31,253
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.

847
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,134
- Tight.
- Attention, citizens.

848
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:41,018
Please stay tuned for a message
from our tyrannical dictator!

849
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:45,616
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...

850
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,771
...shepherd of your dreams.

851
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:52,373
Recently, a certain somebody

852
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,737
has jeopardized our joyous lives.

853
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:01,415
And that somebody
is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!

854
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,775
That is why I come to you,
dear citizens.

855
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,329
For whomever brings me this ogre,

856
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:10,334
shall receive the deal of a lifetime.

857
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,333
Just think of it! Total and

858
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,138
- complete happiness.
- Ya!

859
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,610
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
AII your greatest wishes.

860
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,691
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.

861
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:24,297
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!

862
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:27,538
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.

863
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:33,297
So light your torches, sharpen
your pitchforks and get your mob on!

864
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,692
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

865
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,736
Go back where you came from!

866
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,338
It seems that we are safe.

867
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,173
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky
and torchy out there. Let's go.

868
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:54,253
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.

869
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,298
Look, Shrek, I know things
might seem a little bleak right now,

870
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,815
but things always work themselves
out in the end, you'll see.

871
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,255
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?

872
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,012
There is no tomorrow.

873
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:07,968
There's no day after that, and there's
no day after that day after that!

874
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,496
My life was perfect
and I'm never going to get it back!

875
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:15,096
If your life was so perfect, why'd you
sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?

876
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:18,491
Because I didn't know
what I had until it was gone! AII right?

877
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,852
I didn't know what I had.

878
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,696
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!

879
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,650
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!

880
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:35,809
Gingy?

881
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,889
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?

882
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,288
Collecting my bounty!

883
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,371
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?

884
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,455
Rumpelstiltskin promised
the deal of a lifetime

885
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,498
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?

886
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:51,572
Where all your wishes come true.

887
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,454
Wait a minute.

888
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,814
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?

889
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:02,098
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.

890
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:04,490
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...

891
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,611
Were you going to eat that?

892
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:15,498
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
AIso not Shrek.

893
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:18,811
That's not even an ogre,
it is a troll! Nice try.

894
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:19,969
- And that...
- Roar.

895
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:21,129
...is just sad.

896
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:23,737
And what is that supposed to be?

897
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,413
I'm just a frightened old man.

898
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:28,378
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!

899
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,098
That is your father painted green.

900
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:32,216
No, it's Shrek! Honest!

901
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,689
Take them away!

902
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,613
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?

903
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,374
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!

904
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,134
Stiltskin!

905
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,298
I hear you're looking for me.

906
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,977
AII right! Finally!

907
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:51,450
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?

908
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:53,372
- I do.
- What? But...

909
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:57,294
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.

910
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:03,775
That means you have
to give me anything I want.

911
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,408
No! Only true love's kiss
can break your contract!

912
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,377
So if you thought you were just gonna...

913
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:13,453
-...in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.

914
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,289
Then what do you want?

915
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:29,009
The ogres. They are all free.

916
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,613
But where is Shrek?

917
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,810
This is not good.

918
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:42,256
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.

919
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:48,017
The noble Shrek turns himself in
to save a bunch of filthy ogres.

920
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:51,100
AII that matters is that they're free...

921
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,491
...and Fiona is safe.

922
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:57,773
I bet Fiona would be
really touched to hear that.

923
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,648
But, hey...

924
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:02,618
...I guess you can tell her yourself.

925
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:04,819
Fiona!

926
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:16,978
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!

927
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:18,334
Oh, yeah.

928
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,937
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?

929
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:31,372
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.

930
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:35,296
Nobody's smart but me!

931
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,489
That was a really brave thing
you did, Shrek.

932
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,209
Thank you.

933
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,130
No, you were right.

934
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,976
I wasn't there for you.

935
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,370
And not just at
the Dragon's Keep, but...

936
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,332
...every day since.

937
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,375
Well...

938
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,898
...you're here now.

939
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,218
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!

940
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,699
Don't be a fool, mule!

941
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,249
She's right. Rumpel's palace
is locked up tighter

942
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:14,571
- than OId Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded

943
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:17,618
by a whole bunch of
mean, ugly, nasty witches.

944
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,533
Hey! We can hear you!

945
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:22,773
Sorry!

946
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,932
We must get into the palace.

947
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,136
Man, Shrek and me
just busted out of that place!

948
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,779
But how?

949
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:33,773
The same way we're gonna bust in.

950
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:42,019
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?

951
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,693
I guess it'll have to do.

952
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:53,456
Witches, finally, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

953
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:56,293
The main event of the evening!

954
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,497
I present Shrek and Fiona!

955
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:08,259
And now, to put the past
behind us once and for all,

956
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:12,015
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!

957
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:15,616
Fiona's old flame,
the keeper of the keep...

958
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,293
...Dragon!

959
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,535
- Donkey?
- And Puss!

960
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,249
In Boots!

961
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,096
Get them, get them, witches!

962
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,339
Incoming!

963
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,655
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?

964
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,139
Your wife!

965
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,289
Uh-oh.

966
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,731
I'll call you! We're in love!

967
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,419
Fiona, hold on!

968
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,618
Hey, you!

969
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,898
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!

970
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:55,689
Jump!

971
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:00,169
Now!

972
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:16,174
The dragon goes under the bridge!

973
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,693
Through the loop!

974
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:19,895
And finally...

975
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,573
Into the castle!

976
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:29,299
Run!

977
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,454
Foo!

978
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,494
So long!

979
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,329
Come on, Fifi, go!

980
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,297
Go! Witches, close up the floor!

981
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,894
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!

982
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:52,291
Come on, go! FIy away! Up, up! Go!

983
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,374
Fifi, no!

984
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,771
Victory is ours!

985
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:11,698
Looks like we're having
curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

986
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:14,328
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

987
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,377
You have no idea.

988
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,254
Shrek?

989
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:30,693
His day is up. His day is...!

990
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,375
Shrek?

991
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,012
It's all right.

992
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,615
There has to be something I can do.

993
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:44,890
You've already done
everything for me, Fiona.

994
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,528
You gave me a home and a family.

995
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,372
You have kids?

996
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,451
We have kids.

997
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:55,329
Fergus, Farkle
and a little girl named...

998
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,774
-...Felicia.
- Felicia.

999
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:00,293
I always wanted to have
a daughter named Felicia.

1000
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:02,412
And someday...

1001
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:05,294
...you will.

1002
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:18,100
You know what the
best part of today was?

1003
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:24,613
I got the chance to fall in love
with you all over again.

1004
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,859
Fiona, the sunrise!

1005
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:02,215
You're still... an ogre!

1006
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:07,453
- True love's form.
- Impossible!

1007
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,772
The kiss worked.

1008
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,454
What?!

1009
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,853
Fifi!

1010
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:30,854
Puss!

1011
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,772
No, no, no!

1012
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:37,898
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!

1013
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,859
I love you, Daddy!

1014
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:56,137
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

1015
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:03,452
Everybody, I have found another cake!

1016
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:06,375
Shrek? Are you OK?

1017
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:16,613
Fiona. I've never been better.

1018
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,292
Roar!

1019
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,170
Happy Birthday, Farkle.

1020
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,535
Fergus, my little man!

1021
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,895
And Felicia, sweetheart.

1022
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,210
I believe this is yours.

1023
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,132
Thank you, Daddy.

1024
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,969
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about
giving my babies an encore!

1025
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,176
Please, señor, letus have it!

1026
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:57,330
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!
