1
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:03,799
She looks at me every day.

2
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:05,762
Mary Jane Watson.

3
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:09,960
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.

4
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:11,934
But she can never know.

5
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:15,541
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.

6
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,005
A life she can never be a part of.

7
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:19,473
Who am I?

8
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:22,238
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.

9
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:25,404
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.

10
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:27,140
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:27,617 --> 00:03:29,550
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:33,647
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:36,756
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:39,187
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,156
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:46,627
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:49,889
I told you,
I don't understand that language.

18
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,001
- Speak English.
- You can't make pizza.

19
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,033
I can't?
I've been making pizza five years.

20
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:57,001
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

21
00:03:57,173 --> 00:04:00,107
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

22
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,902
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

23
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,273
- Why didn't you send Saleem?
- Saleem was deported yesterday.

24
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,437
- Look... Smiley.
- What about my cheese pizza?

25
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,606
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

26
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:15,914
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

27
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,151
This is your last chance.

28
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:23,053
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

29
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:26,627
Go!

30
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:50,268
Hey, what, are you stupid?

31
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:15,459
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

32
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:25,763
I'm gonna get it!

33
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,716
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

34
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:45,149
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

35
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:47,115
See you.

36
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:49,451
Way to go, Spidey!

37
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:00,576
Pizza time.

38
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:06,907
You're late.

39
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:09,181
I'm not paying for those.

40
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,923
Elevator.

41
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:50,239
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

42
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:54,909
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

43
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:57,054
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

44
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:59,712
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.

45
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,414
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.

46
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,930
You're fired.

47
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,290
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

48
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:16,958
Dogs catching Frisbees?

49
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:19,433
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

50
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:20,833
- Boss.
- Not now.

51
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:23,735
The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.

52
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:26,843
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

53
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:30,411
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you... Still not now!

54
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,173
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

55
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:35,078
He won't let me take
any more pictures.

56
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:36,842
You turned the whole city
against him.

57
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,508
A fact I'm very proud of.

58
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:42,451
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

59
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,989
- It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
- Thanks for the good news.

60
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,490
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I really need the money.

61
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,692
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

62
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:54,558
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

63
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:57,427
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

64
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,500
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

65
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,966
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.

66
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,002
All right, Mr. Jameson.

67
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:07,867
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

68
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,668
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

69
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:11,401
I told you, he's not a menace.

70
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:13,169
- I told you...
- I'll take care of it.

71
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,972
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.

72
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:16,643
That's outrageous.

73
00:09:16,815 --> 00:09:18,782
Done. Give this to the girl.

74
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,144
Thank you. Bye-bye.

75
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:22,107
Hi.

76
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:23,785
Hey, Pete.

77
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:30,589
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

78
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,894
- Right.
- Sorry.

79
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:35,322
Hey.

80
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:37,387
Chin up, okay?

81
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,973
Watch it, jerk!

82
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:04,617
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

83
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:06,309
Where were you headed, Parker?

84
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:07,780
To your class.

85
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:09,785
My class is over.

86
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:12,150
See me standing here?

87
00:10:12,324 --> 00:10:16,123
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

88
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:17,624
Then be here.

89
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:20,462
Look at you, Peter.

90
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:25,330
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

91
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,400
You always appear exhausted.

92
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,895
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

93
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:35,235
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

94
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:38,535
Planning is not a major
at this university.

95
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,870
Octavius is a friend of mine.

96
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:46,205
Better do your research, Parker.

97
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,712
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

98
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:13,228
Surprise!

99
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:15,337
Well, say something.

100
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:16,767
What's the occasion?

101
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,499
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

102
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:22,839
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

103
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:26,509
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

104
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,614
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.

105
00:11:29,116 --> 00:11:30,480
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

106
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,877
Long time, no see.

107
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:35,912
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

108
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:37,782
It's going fine. It's going good.

109
00:11:37,955 --> 00:11:39,217
She's brilliant in it.

110
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,051
Harry sent me roses.

111
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:43,784
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

112
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:47,125
I've been busy.

113
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:50,855
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

114
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:53,000
The less you see of that man,
the better.

115
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:56,624
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

116
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:58,065
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

117
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:00,364
So how are things going at Oscorp?

118
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:03,405
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

119
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:05,804
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

120
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:10,072
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

121
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:11,543
Thank you.

122
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:15,712
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

123
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:18,318
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?

124
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:19,747
You'd introduce me?

125
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,117
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

126
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,314
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

127
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:27,425
M.J., could you give me a hand?

128
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:31,387
She's waiting for you, pal.

129
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:33,324
What do you mean?

130
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:35,964
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

131
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:37,864
However you want to look at it.

132
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:40,394
I don't have time for girls right now.

133
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:41,900
Why, are you dead?

134
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:43,663
I've been kind of busy.

135
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,430
Taking pictures of your friend?

136
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:48,431
Could we get off that subject?

137
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:51,934
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

138
00:12:52,112 --> 00:12:53,772
Then be honest with me.

139
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:56,908
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

140
00:13:01,718 --> 00:13:04,084
Peter, don't you understand
how I feel?

141
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:06,187
I want this guy dead.

142
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:09,152
The same way you want the guy
who killed your Uncle Ben dead.

143
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:20,132
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
rag on you on your birthday.

144
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,326
You're my buddy, you know that.

145
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:27,634
You're family, Pete.

146
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:31,908
My father loved you.
You were like a son to him.

147
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:39,713
Thank you, Harry.

148
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:14,997
May.

149
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:16,732
Oh, what, Ben?

150
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:20,010
Wait.

151
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:21,644
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

152
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,278
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

153
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:31,419
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

154
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:33,514
Did they have a good time?

155
00:14:34,022 --> 00:14:35,284
I'm sure they did.

156
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:40,957
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.

157
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:46,725
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

158
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:48,692
I'm worried about you.

159
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:54,092
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

160
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:56,704
Oh, my. You did?

161
00:14:57,206 --> 00:14:58,537
Oh, well.

162
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:00,140
So?

163
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,369
I'm a little behind.

164
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:05,072
Everybody is.

165
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,748
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

166
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:12,646
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

167
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,944
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

168
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:18,913
You need it more than I do.

169
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,613
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!

170
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,816
You can take this money from me.

171
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:26,722
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

172
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:29,386
And don't you dare leave it here.

173
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:31,498
Oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,226
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

175
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,306
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

176
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:47,837
I think to myself at times...

177
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:53,311
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

178
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,374
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

179
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:04,514
Now...

180
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:09,155
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

181
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:25,395
Hey.

182
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:27,666
Hey. You're still here.

183
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:30,401
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

184
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:33,943
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

185
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:38,071
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

186
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,649
The photographer liked my face.

187
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:42,684
I was only supposed to be
in the catalogue.

188
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:46,344
Then I got the part in the play.
Everything at once.

189
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,513
Your dream came true.

190
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,852
How about yours?

191
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,952
I'm fine.

192
00:16:58,031 --> 00:17:00,397
I wish you'd come see the play.

193
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,761
You're the one who
always encouraged me.

194
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:05,501
I plan to.

195
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,872
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

196
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:16,874
Oh, boy, yeah.

197
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:20,447
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

198
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:26,612
Nothing.

199
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:32,823
Do you want to say something?

200
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:40,420
I...

201
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:47,629
...was...

202
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:51,900
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

203
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,071
You're such a mystery.

204
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:15,119
Peter.

205
00:18:16,524 --> 00:18:18,048
What?

206
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,757
Happy birthday.

207
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,598
I'm seeing somebody now.

208
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,699
- Therapy.
- No.

209
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:41,669
A person, a man.

210
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:44,209
You mean, like a boyfriend?

211
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:47,040
Well, like I like him.

212
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,614
What?

213
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:53,975
Nothing.

214
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:58,083
That's good, you know?
Companionship...

215
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,450
May be more than that.

216
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,083
More?

217
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:06,293
I don't know.

218
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:09,858
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

219
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,868
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.

220
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:18,531
Don't disappoint me.

221
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:21,633
I won't.

222
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:37,375
Rent.

223
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,883
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?

224
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,581
Can I spend it?

225
00:19:46,326 --> 00:19:48,225
I have a paycheck due this week
and...

226
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:51,726
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as...

227
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:55,386
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

228
00:19:55,999 --> 00:20:00,458
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.

229
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,728
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

230
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:07,738
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

231
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:12,309
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.

232
00:21:06,152 --> 00:21:07,744
Hello?

233
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:16,821
Rent?

234
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:24,297
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

235
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:28,459
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

236
00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:30,263
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

237
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:32,234
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

238
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:33,634
Who do we have here?

239
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:35,535
This is my good friend
I called you about.

240
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,369
He got me through
high-school science.

241
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:40,602
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...

242
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,212
I know what you're doing here...

243
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,574
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

244
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:47,379
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...

245
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,882
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

246
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:53,419
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

247
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:58,184
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

248
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:02,384
Interesting fellow, your friend.

249
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:04,723
I won't take much of your time.

250
00:22:04,897 --> 00:22:09,230
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

251
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:12,126
He also tells me you're lazy.

252
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:14,364
I'm trying to do better.

253
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:18,132
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

254
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:21,636
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

255
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,801
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

256
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:26,503
Otto, your lunch is ready.

257
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,442
- This is my wife, Rosie.
- Hello.

258
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:32,107
This is Peter Parker. Connors' student.
The one who falls asleep in class.

259
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:35,344
I always fell asleep in physics class.

260
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,353
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- Good to meet you.

261
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,423
Excuse me.

262
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:43,820
Is that it?

263
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:47,861
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

264
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,096
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

265
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:52,631
Sympathetic frequencies.

266
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,824
Harmonic reinforcement?

267
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:56,897
Go on.

268
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,997
An exponential increase
in energy output.

269
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:02,833
A huge amount of energy.

270
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:07,171
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

271
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,506
It's all so amazing. If it works,
it could change the way we live.

272
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,705
It is amazing, and it will work.

273
00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:16,408
Are you sure you could stabilize
the fusion reaction?

274
00:23:16,585 --> 00:23:20,247
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

275
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:22,320
This is my life's work.

276
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:25,652
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

277
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:28,054
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.

278
00:23:28,227 --> 00:23:31,627
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

279
00:23:31,796 --> 00:23:33,593
You can sleep soundly tonight.

280
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:35,493
Otto's done his homework.

281
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,760
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

282
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:41,430
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

283
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:43,798
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

284
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,366
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

285
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:48,867
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?

286
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:52,478
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

287
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:55,011
Rosie, I love this boy.

288
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:58,946
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

289
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:01,575
Well...

290
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:04,085
I don't really know.

291
00:24:04,254 --> 00:24:07,348
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

292
00:24:07,591 --> 00:24:10,559
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

293
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:12,750
Love should never be a secret.

294
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:16,158
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

295
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:18,424
...gonna make you sick.

296
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,996
I finally got lucky in love.

297
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:22,498
We both did.

298
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:26,364
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

299
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:30,234
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

300
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:33,671
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

301
00:24:33,843 --> 00:24:37,005
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

302
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:39,511
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

303
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:43,482
Time present and time past

304
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,675
- Are both perhaps present
- Perhaps present

305
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:48,150
- In time future
- In time future

306
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,254
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

307
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,650
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

308
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:55,350
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

309
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:59,885
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

310
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:01,858
Poetry.

311
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:04,989
Never fails.

312
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:12,438
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie

313
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:14,971
Brightest green were all her garments

314
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:17,507
And her hair was like the sunshine

315
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,571
Day by day he gazed upon her

316
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:19,416
Rent!

317
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:23,019
Where is my money?!

318
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:50,976
You seem jittery tonight.

319
00:26:51,147 --> 00:26:52,808
You never know who's coming.

320
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,228
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

321
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:29,740
How'd you do that?

322
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:35,111
Work out, plenty of rest.

323
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,077
You know, eat your green vegetables.

324
00:27:38,016 --> 00:27:41,473
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

325
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,652
Come on. Go.

326
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:49,990
Keep it steady.

327
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:13,999
It's a web.

328
00:28:15,145 --> 00:28:16,839
Go, Spidey, go!

329
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:26,182
We got trouble!

330
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:46,768
Get me down!

331
00:28:50,037 --> 00:28:52,870
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

332
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,338
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

333
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:58,635
Then you think we should
forgive them?

334
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:03,173
Yes.

335
00:29:03,681 --> 00:29:05,171
I mean, no.

336
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:13,751
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

337
00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:15,753
Whatever.

338
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,950
Shoelace.

339
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,090
You might want to...

340
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:35,631
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.

341
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:39,672
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

342
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:43,073
It helps maintain the illusion.

343
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:46,846
I understand.

344
00:29:47,814 --> 00:29:51,250
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

345
00:29:51,418 --> 00:29:52,907
But not to come late.

346
00:29:55,354 --> 00:29:58,811
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...

347
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,088
Listen, can't you...?

348
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,644
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man

349
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:30,803
A-does whatever a spider can

350
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:33,972
A-spins a web, any size

351
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:36,515
Catches thieves a-just like flies

352
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:39,915
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

353
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:58,325
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

354
00:30:58,501 --> 00:30:59,866
Yeah, I'm sure.

355
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:01,936
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

356
00:31:02,105 --> 00:31:03,833
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

357
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:08,901
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

358
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:11,541
What are you doing here?

359
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,917
You hungry?

360
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,318
Starved.

361
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:21,864
What was that?

362
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:28,098
Okay.

363
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:05,426
How you doing?

364
00:33:06,032 --> 00:33:07,498
Good.

365
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:13,596
I just wanna say,
I really like what you do.

366
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:16,568
- Think it's great.
- Thanks.

367
00:33:17,741 --> 00:33:20,903
I'm with Weisenhower,
Anderson, Nichols & Knudsen...

368
00:33:21,076 --> 00:33:22,771
...PR firm in the building...

369
00:33:22,945 --> 00:33:25,777
...and I just wanna say I think
the image you have is fantastic.

370
00:33:25,947 --> 00:33:28,779
It's really put together.
The costume. The... this thing.

371
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:32,076
I mean, it's really put together.
It's great.

372
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:36,486
I think you could do more
than print though.

373
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:39,384
I think you might wanna try some TV,
you know?

374
00:33:39,557 --> 00:33:41,717
Can I riff for you?
Come up with a couple ideas?

375
00:33:41,892 --> 00:33:44,655
Just what my company would do?
Let's see, what do I got?

376
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:47,557
How about a children's book?
You could...

377
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,562
Like Charlotte's Web,
but without the pig. That kind of thing.

378
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:53,097
How about a line of hammocks?

379
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:55,599
Because it's kind of a web thing.

380
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,206
You could do a men's cologne
called Thwip.

381
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,001
Let me give you a card.

382
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,972
I don't have any pockets.

383
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,577
Yeah.

384
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:12,440
Well, we're right in the building.

385
00:34:23,057 --> 00:34:25,524
That doesn't help.
I do that all the time.

386
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,384
- Slow elevator.
- Yeah.

387
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:53,445
Thus, the second-order term...

388
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:56,342
...in the expansion of
the exact order...

389
00:34:56,515 --> 00:34:59,847
...is identical to the second order...

390
00:35:00,018 --> 00:35:03,509
...calculated from first-order
perturbation energy.

391
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,747
Since we are free to choose
an arbitrary origin for our energy...

392
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:32,869
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

393
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:34,971
Hi, M.J.

394
00:35:35,145 --> 00:35:36,441
This is Peter.

395
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:40,038
I was on my way to your show and...

396
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:44,784
Well, I was on my bike...

397
00:35:47,788 --> 00:35:49,311
Are you there?

398
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:54,824
I really was planning on it all day.

399
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:57,651
And...

400
00:35:59,063 --> 00:36:01,394
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

401
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:03,358
Bingo.

402
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,061
It's amazing, isn't it?

403
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:09,835
How complicated a simple thing...

404
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:15,133
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.

405
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:22,879
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.

406
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,675
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

407
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,374
Your time has expired.

408
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:32,817
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.

409
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:44,588
I wanna tell you the truth.

410
00:36:46,732 --> 00:36:48,165
Here it is.

411
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:50,827
I'm Spider-Man.

412
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:53,368
Weird, huh?

413
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:57,536
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

414
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:03,337
If my enemies found out about you...

415
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:09,411
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

416
00:37:15,287 --> 00:37:18,279
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

417
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:31,060
Ladies and gentlemen...

418
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:35,066
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

419
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:36,896
But first, before we start...

420
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:41,438
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

421
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:43,364
Because we found the rubber band.

422
00:37:48,046 --> 00:37:49,478
It's a terrible joke.

423
00:37:49,646 --> 00:37:51,375
But thank you for coming.

424
00:37:51,715 --> 00:37:52,942
Today...

425
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:57,642
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

426
00:37:57,953 --> 00:38:03,151
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

427
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:07,755
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

428
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:18,424
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

429
00:38:18,602 --> 00:38:22,059
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

430
00:38:22,238 --> 00:38:24,763
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

431
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,206
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

432
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,608
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

433
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,875
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

434
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,882
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

435
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:27,486
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

436
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:29,451
...is as advanced as you suggest...

437
00:39:29,622 --> 00:39:31,647
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

438
00:39:31,824 --> 00:39:33,085
How right you are.

439
00:39:33,258 --> 00:39:35,317
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

440
00:39:35,494 --> 00:39:37,859
...to protect
my higher brain function.

441
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:42,397
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

442
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,130
And now on to the main event.

443
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,201
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

444
00:40:06,817 --> 00:40:10,650
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

445
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,947
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

446
00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:18,854
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.

447
00:40:19,026 --> 00:40:20,755
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

448
00:40:34,705 --> 00:40:36,104
Ladies and gentlemen...

449
00:40:38,774 --> 00:40:40,605
...fasten your seat belts.

450
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,950
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

451
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,062
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

452
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:11,460
Thank you.

453
00:41:11,632 --> 00:41:13,566
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

454
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,071
The power of the sun...

455
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:25,835
...in the palm of my hand.

456
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,019
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

457
00:41:50,195 --> 00:41:52,026
It’ll soon stabilize!

458
00:41:57,701 --> 00:42:00,602
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

459
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,605
We have a containment breach!

460
00:42:10,377 --> 00:42:12,436
Otto, please get back!

461
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,277
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

462
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:19,275
It will stabilize! It's under control!

463
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:21,316
I'm in charge here!

464
00:42:21,486 --> 00:42:24,352
It's my money! I'm in con...

465
00:42:27,957 --> 00:42:29,982
This doesn't change anything.

466
00:42:33,295 --> 00:42:35,660
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.

467
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:37,325
No!

468
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:57,837
Rosie!

469
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,698
Watch it.

470
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:31,099
That was too close.

471
00:43:31,272 --> 00:43:35,332
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

472
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:42,144
I'm ruined.

473
00:43:43,815 --> 00:43:46,305
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

474
00:43:46,484 --> 00:43:48,145
He saved your life, sir.

475
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:50,985
He humiliated me by touching me.

476
00:43:51,154 --> 00:43:53,747
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

477
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,822
What was he doing here anyway?

478
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,669
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

479
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:16,965
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

480
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,699
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

481
00:44:19,876 --> 00:44:22,037
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

482
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:25,179
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

483
00:44:25,347 --> 00:44:27,712
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

484
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:31,146
...with posterior spinal fusion
from 7-T1 to T12.

485
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:32,714
We're ready, doctor.

486
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:37,852
Anybody here take shop class?

487
00:45:16,752 --> 00:45:18,413
No! No! No!

488
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:23,821
Help me! Help me!

489
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:40,690
No!

490
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:35,107
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

491
00:47:35,277 --> 00:47:37,437
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

492
00:47:37,611 --> 00:47:40,409
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

493
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:43,572
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

494
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:48,713
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

495
00:47:48,887 --> 00:47:50,114
Hoffman!

496
00:47:52,156 --> 00:47:53,622
What are we gonna call this guy?

497
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,020
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.

498
00:47:56,192 --> 00:47:57,749
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

499
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,021
- "Dr. Strange."
- That's pretty good.

500
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:05,026
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

501
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,494
- I like it.
- Of course you do.

502
00:48:07,668 --> 00:48:11,467
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

503
00:48:11,637 --> 00:48:13,571
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?

504
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:15,399
Get out.

505
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:17,369
Chief, I found Parker.

506
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:19,736
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

507
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:22,242
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

508
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:23,709
I heard Spider-Man was there.

509
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:27,474
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

510
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:28,980
Chief, the planetarium party.

511
00:48:29,151 --> 00:48:30,811
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

512
00:48:30,985 --> 00:48:32,543
What do you know
about high society?

513
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,017
- Oh. Well, I...
- Don't answer that.

514
00:48:35,188 --> 00:48:38,624
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

515
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:41,760
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

516
00:48:41,927 --> 00:48:43,689
Could you pay me in advance?

517
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,203
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

518
00:48:55,371 --> 00:48:57,998
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

519
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:14,813
My Rosie's dead.

520
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,750
My dream is dead.

521
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:23,720
And these...

522
00:49:25,727 --> 00:49:29,218
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

523
00:49:32,065 --> 00:49:33,463
...along with me.

524
00:49:42,406 --> 00:49:44,033
Something...

525
00:49:45,508 --> 00:49:46,998
...in my head.

526
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:52,237
Something talking.

527
00:49:56,283 --> 00:49:57,750
The inhibitor chip!

528
00:50:01,154 --> 00:50:02,711
Gone.

529
00:50:07,492 --> 00:50:08,789
Rebuild.

530
00:50:12,195 --> 00:50:13,856
No.

531
00:50:15,064 --> 00:50:16,497
Peter was right.

532
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,425
I miscalculated.

533
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:29,065
I couldn't have miscalculated.

534
00:50:30,176 --> 00:50:32,109
It was working, wasn't it?

535
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:38,413
Yes.

536
00:50:39,482 --> 00:50:42,474
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

537
00:50:42,652 --> 00:50:44,915
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

538
00:50:45,788 --> 00:50:47,618
But we need money.

539
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:50,721
Steal it?

540
00:50:50,892 --> 00:50:52,654
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

541
00:50:55,328 --> 00:50:56,658
That's right.

542
00:50:58,564 --> 00:51:01,794
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

543
00:51:05,436 --> 00:51:07,063
We'll do it here.

544
00:51:07,805 --> 00:51:11,103
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

545
00:51:11,407 --> 00:51:13,897
Nothing will stand in our way.

546
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:15,407
Nothing!

547
00:51:20,814 --> 00:51:23,476
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.

548
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,412
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

549
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:27,848
Yes, but I'm afraid...

550
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,079
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

551
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:34,880
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

552
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,423
You are?

553
00:51:41,496 --> 00:51:44,727
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

554
00:51:44,899 --> 00:51:47,492
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

555
00:51:47,668 --> 00:51:48,930
But the fact is...

556
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:53,436
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

557
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:55,630
Well...

558
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:59,239
At least we get the toaster.

559
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:03,436
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

560
00:52:06,281 --> 00:52:07,612
Oh, yes, I see.

561
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,710
Okay.

562
00:52:13,788 --> 00:52:15,880
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

563
00:52:33,202 --> 00:52:34,533
Peter?

564
00:52:36,371 --> 00:52:38,339
Don't leave me.

565
00:52:39,141 --> 00:52:41,574
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

566
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,304
Hold it!

567
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,739
Put your arms up! All of them!

568
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:11,394
Here's your change!

569
00:53:21,305 --> 00:53:22,829
Oh, no. Come on!

570
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,444
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

571
00:53:38,618 --> 00:53:40,210
Not anymore.

572
00:54:09,943 --> 00:54:11,739
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

573
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,511
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.

574
00:54:21,418 --> 00:54:23,180
Wait a second.

575
00:54:40,932 --> 00:54:43,162
- Hand her over.
- Of course.

576
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:45,196
Easy, now.

577
00:54:46,904 --> 00:54:48,598
Butterfingers.

578
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,142
Look out!

579
00:55:04,284 --> 00:55:06,274
Help me!

580
00:55:08,387 --> 00:55:10,980
- Help me!
- I'm coming!

581
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:18,125
Hang on!

582
00:55:49,885 --> 00:55:51,283
Help!

583
00:56:16,405 --> 00:56:18,066
Thank you.

584
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:22,640
Aunt May.

585
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,801
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

586
00:56:25,979 --> 00:56:29,004
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

587
00:56:34,552 --> 00:56:36,178
Come on.

588
00:56:40,156 --> 00:56:42,283
Shame on you.

589
00:57:14,582 --> 00:57:16,209
There you go.

590
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:20,517
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

591
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,948
We sure showed him.

592
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:23,918
What do you mean, "we"?

593
00:57:28,026 --> 00:57:30,425
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- Take me.

594
00:57:57,949 --> 00:58:00,610
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

595
00:58:01,618 --> 00:58:03,517
Penny! Over here!

596
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,414
Leave it.

597
00:58:14,461 --> 00:58:16,951
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

598
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,461
Why? It's a party.

599
00:58:18,631 --> 00:58:21,565
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

600
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:25,065
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

601
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:27,096
Not to mention your friend the bug.

602
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:28,898
Not tonight, Harry.

603
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:32,598
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.

604
00:58:33,075 --> 00:58:34,508
Parker!

605
00:58:35,177 --> 00:58:36,404
Parker!

606
00:58:36,944 --> 00:58:40,003
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

607
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,171
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

608
00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:44,282
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.

609
00:58:44,717 --> 00:58:45,979
Beautiful tie.

610
00:58:46,152 --> 00:58:48,415
Get a shot of us with the DA.

611
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,310
Beautiful dress.

612
00:58:50,755 --> 00:58:53,484
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

613
00:58:54,825 --> 00:58:56,417
Wife.

614
00:58:58,394 --> 00:59:00,658
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

615
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:03,923
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

616
00:59:04,099 --> 00:59:06,293
...is pleased to present
our guest of honor.

617
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:10,232
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

618
00:59:11,337 --> 00:59:14,499
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

619
00:59:14,673 --> 00:59:16,538
...Captain John Jameson.

620
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:02,733
Hi.

621
01:00:05,045 --> 01:00:08,411
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

622
01:00:08,581 --> 01:00:10,811
But there was a disturbance.

623
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,279
I don't know you.

624
01:00:14,252 --> 01:00:18,153
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

625
01:00:19,056 --> 01:00:20,716
I've been reading poetry lately.

626
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:22,255
Whatever that means.

627
01:00:22,758 --> 01:00:26,249
Day by day he gazed upon her

628
01:00:26,695 --> 01:00:29,527
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day...

629
01:00:29,697 --> 01:00:31,562
Don't start.

630
01:00:33,032 --> 01:00:34,829
Can I get you a drink?

631
01:00:35,001 --> 01:00:36,729
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

632
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:39,029
John.

633
01:00:39,204 --> 01:00:43,105
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

634
01:00:43,274 --> 01:00:46,242
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

635
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,899
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

636
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,306
Even my father.

637
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:54,242
He came backstage to borrow cash.

638
01:00:55,884 --> 01:01:00,252
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

639
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,580
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

640
01:01:04,257 --> 01:01:05,848
After all these years...

641
01:01:07,158 --> 01:01:09,751
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

642
01:01:35,246 --> 01:01:38,612
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

643
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:42,047
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

644
01:01:42,219 --> 01:01:44,277
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.

645
01:01:44,453 --> 01:01:46,250
Don't act like you're my friend.

646
01:01:47,022 --> 01:01:48,990
You stole M.J. from me.

647
01:01:49,391 --> 01:01:51,290
You stole my father's love.

648
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:56,952
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

649
01:01:58,197 --> 01:02:00,426
Huh? Isn't that right?

650
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:02,396
Huh, brother?

651
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:16,104
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

652
01:02:16,811 --> 01:02:21,270
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

653
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,256
What a surprise.

654
01:02:33,424 --> 01:02:36,358
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

655
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:05,744
Oh, no. No!

656
01:03:16,757 --> 01:03:18,917
Why is this happening to me?

657
01:04:42,188 --> 01:04:44,781
You told him yes? Just that fast?

658
01:04:44,956 --> 01:04:46,389
It felt right.

659
01:04:47,325 --> 01:04:49,292
Well, you might congratulate me.

660
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,360
Congratulations.

661
01:04:51,529 --> 01:04:53,621
Good luck in the world.

662
01:04:54,964 --> 01:04:56,795
John loves me.

663
01:04:56,966 --> 01:05:00,662
My father always said,
"You'll never be worth anything.

664
01:05:00,836 --> 01:05:02,427
No man will ever want you."

665
01:05:02,603 --> 01:05:04,935
So, what, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life...

666
01:05:05,106 --> 01:05:08,336
...trying to prove something
to your father?

667
01:05:08,508 --> 01:05:10,532
Do you really love this guy?

668
01:05:11,277 --> 01:05:13,836
- Very much.
- "Very much"?

669
01:05:14,012 --> 01:05:15,502
That just doesn't fly.

670
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,113
I mean, if you really love the guy,
then the answer is:

671
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:20,182
"Do I love him? I adore him.

672
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:22,848
He's my comfortable afghan.

673
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,214
He's all I can think about.

674
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:29,448
Everything he is, everything he says,
everything he does...

675
01:05:29,624 --> 01:05:34,719
...to me, for me, with me,
is sweet kisses.

676
01:05:36,196 --> 01:05:38,993
He makes up for all the grief
and pain I've ever had...

677
01:05:39,164 --> 01:05:42,133
...and in the dark of the night,
he is there."

678
01:05:42,301 --> 01:05:45,064
That's the answer I need.

679
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:48,068
Not just "I love him very much."

680
01:05:50,006 --> 01:05:52,565
You read too many love stories.

681
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:55,040
What about that perfect kiss
you said you had once?

682
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:57,701
- The guy you believed in?
- That was a fantasy.

683
01:05:57,879 --> 01:05:59,244
That's all he is.

684
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,904
But what's wrong with believing
in love stories?

685
01:06:12,456 --> 01:06:14,424
You seem very okay to me.

686
01:06:15,126 --> 01:06:16,490
My diagnosis?

687
01:06:16,993 --> 01:06:18,460
It's up here.

688
01:06:21,163 --> 01:06:25,189
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

689
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:29,096
There is one dream where...

690
01:06:29,536 --> 01:06:31,003
...in my dream...

691
01:06:32,172 --> 01:06:33,536
...I'm Spider-Man.

692
01:06:33,939 --> 01:06:38,500
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

693
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:43,671
So you're Spider-Man.

694
01:06:43,847 --> 01:06:45,074
In my dream.

695
01:06:45,248 --> 01:06:49,650
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

696
01:06:49,818 --> 01:06:51,945
So it's somebody else's dream.

697
01:06:54,021 --> 01:06:57,013
- What's your major? Theater Arts?
- Science.

698
01:06:57,224 --> 01:06:58,451
Connors?

699
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:00,217
He flunking you?

700
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:01,859
He says he might.

701
01:07:02,327 --> 01:07:03,954
There you go.

702
01:07:12,636 --> 01:07:14,535
What about this friend?

703
01:07:15,237 --> 01:07:18,569
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

704
01:07:19,073 --> 01:07:23,008
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

705
01:07:23,644 --> 01:07:27,409
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

706
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:29,343
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

707
01:07:30,116 --> 01:07:33,175
I've been there. Who was I?

708
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,480
Identity. Big one.

709
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:41,954
Me, I go to my shrink.

710
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,583
What does he tell you?

711
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:49,389
She tells me I need some
strong focus on what I want.

712
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:54,166
And I have to find out
who won't let me have it, why...

713
01:07:55,068 --> 01:08:00,060
...and then I have to tackle that guy,
let him hear me...

714
01:08:00,238 --> 01:08:04,071
And one more thing. I have to
make sure I'm right about what I want.

715
01:08:06,243 --> 01:08:07,732
Listen...

716
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:12,175
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

717
01:08:12,581 --> 01:08:14,310
That's why you keep falling.

718
01:08:16,784 --> 01:08:18,718
You always have a choice, Peter.

719
01:08:20,954 --> 01:08:22,649
I have a choice.

720
01:08:31,762 --> 01:08:34,753
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...

721
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:37,298
...make me sad.

722
01:08:38,801 --> 01:08:40,735
Can't you understand?

723
01:08:41,469 --> 01:08:43,630
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

724
01:08:43,805 --> 01:08:46,773
You know I understand.

725
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:51,541
But I thought you'd learned
the meaning of responsibility.

726
01:08:53,246 --> 01:08:55,975
Oh, you don't know how it feels.

727
01:08:58,015 --> 01:09:01,109
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

728
01:09:02,218 --> 01:09:05,312
...fairness, justice...

729
01:09:05,622 --> 01:09:10,353
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

730
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:14,458
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

731
01:09:15,562 --> 01:09:18,122
I can't live your dreams anymore.

732
01:09:19,298 --> 01:09:21,129
I want a life of my own.

733
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,426
You've been given a gift, Peter.

734
01:09:23,735 --> 01:09:28,000
With great power
comes great responsibility.

735
01:09:32,575 --> 01:09:34,236
Take my hand, son.

736
01:09:47,419 --> 01:09:49,148
No, Uncle Ben.

737
01:09:51,256 --> 01:09:53,485
I'm just Peter Parker.

738
01:09:55,259 --> 01:09:56,987
I'm Spider-Man...

739
01:09:57,861 --> 01:09:59,453
...no more.

740
01:10:00,562 --> 01:10:01,961
No more.

741
01:10:10,203 --> 01:10:11,670
No more.

742
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:42,940
- You punk!
- Sorry.

743
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:45,372
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

744
01:11:52,814 --> 01:11:54,042
Hurry up!

745
01:12:03,823 --> 01:12:07,519
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are?

746
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:09,557
Someone, please?

747
01:12:11,662 --> 01:12:13,891
.23 electron volts.

748
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,034
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

749
01:12:32,645 --> 01:12:32,712
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

750
01:12:32,747 --> 01:12:35,544
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

751
01:12:35,714 --> 01:12:38,546
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

752
01:12:38,716 --> 01:12:40,684
...in a very inexcusable manner.

753
01:12:40,851 --> 01:12:43,011
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

754
01:12:43,186 --> 01:12:46,382
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

755
01:12:46,555 --> 01:12:48,318
That would be hypocrisy.

756
01:12:49,358 --> 01:12:51,757
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

757
01:12:57,564 --> 01:12:59,053
"I am glad."

758
01:12:59,899 --> 01:13:01,833
"I am glad."

759
01:13:02,233 --> 01:13:03,928
"I am glad."

760
01:13:05,837 --> 01:13:07,963
Are you glad to hear it?

761
01:13:10,174 --> 01:13:12,505
I am glad...

762
01:13:12,675 --> 01:13:14,108
...to hear it.

763
01:13:14,277 --> 01:13:15,971
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

764
01:13:16,144 --> 01:13:19,806
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

765
01:13:21,749 --> 01:13:24,717
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

766
01:13:24,884 --> 01:13:26,908
You could've told me
you were coming.

767
01:13:27,086 --> 01:13:29,418
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

768
01:13:33,157 --> 01:13:34,818
You look different.

769
01:13:35,559 --> 01:13:40,495
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

770
01:13:40,663 --> 01:13:42,528
I do my homework now.

771
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:46,497
You wanna get some chow mein?

772
01:13:46,668 --> 01:13:48,066
Peter...

773
01:13:48,502 --> 01:13:50,094
...I'm getting married.

774
01:13:55,007 --> 01:13:57,839
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

775
01:13:58,210 --> 01:13:59,871
And who's the groom?

776
01:14:00,211 --> 01:14:01,906
You hadn't decided yet.

777
01:14:04,347 --> 01:14:06,440
You think just because
you saw my play...

778
01:14:06,616 --> 01:14:09,015
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

779
01:14:09,284 --> 01:14:12,480
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

780
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:16,145
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

781
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:18,181
You're too late.

782
01:14:19,292 --> 01:14:20,657
Will you think about it?

783
01:14:20,826 --> 01:14:22,157
Think about what?

784
01:14:22,328 --> 01:14:24,319
Picking up where we left off.

785
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:25,826
Where was that?

786
01:14:25,997 --> 01:14:28,488
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

787
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:30,064
I don't think it's that simple.

788
01:14:30,234 --> 01:14:32,498
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

789
01:14:32,669 --> 01:14:34,295
You don't understand.

790
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:37,238
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

791
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,205
I'm different.

792
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,798
Punch me, I bleed.

793
01:14:49,082 --> 01:14:50,571
I have to go.

794
01:14:57,655 --> 01:14:59,884
I'm getting married in a church.

795
01:15:07,595 --> 01:15:09,187
You are different.

796
01:15:24,008 --> 01:15:27,272
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

797
01:15:27,944 --> 01:15:30,538
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?

798
01:15:30,713 --> 01:15:33,738
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

799
01:15:33,916 --> 01:15:37,078
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

800
01:15:37,251 --> 01:15:40,947
Don’t tell me you have the head of an extraterrestrial in
there? Because if you do? You're the third guy this week.

801
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:45,320
Where the hell did you get that?

802
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:47,015
In the garbage.

803
01:15:47,193 --> 01:15:48,625
In the garbage?

804
01:15:50,628 --> 01:15:52,288
He must've given up.

805
01:15:52,696 --> 01:15:57,428
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

806
01:15:58,267 --> 01:16:01,394
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

807
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:06,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

808
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:09,633
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.

809
01:16:09,809 --> 01:16:12,868
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

810
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,647
Your wife is still on that line.

811
01:16:17,048 --> 01:16:18,811
Flowers? How much?

812
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:22,646
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

813
01:16:22,819 --> 01:16:24,047
Get plastic.

814
01:16:25,187 --> 01:16:26,814
Gotta go, big story.

815
01:16:37,897 --> 01:16:41,162
Spider-Man
Spider-Man

816
01:16:41,334 --> 01:16:44,325
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

817
01:16:44,502 --> 01:16:47,902
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

818
01:17:19,695 --> 01:17:22,027
Come on, man. Get the money.

819
01:17:23,698 --> 01:17:25,529
Come on, come on.

820
01:17:27,901 --> 01:17:29,391
Help!

821
01:17:33,339 --> 01:17:34,567
Come on!

822
01:17:41,145 --> 01:17:43,375
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

823
01:17:43,547 --> 01:17:45,707
He was a peaceful man.

824
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:49,980
And it was all my doing.

825
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:26,245
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

826
01:18:26,413 --> 01:18:28,438
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

827
01:18:28,815 --> 01:18:32,011
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

828
01:18:32,184 --> 01:18:34,344
...and he wanted to drive you.

829
01:18:34,686 --> 01:18:37,211
If only I had stopped him.

830
01:18:37,688 --> 01:18:40,851
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

831
01:18:56,602 --> 01:18:58,126
I'm responsible.

832
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:03,304
For what?

833
01:19:04,308 --> 01:19:06,503
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

834
01:19:06,676 --> 01:19:08,940
But you were at the library.

835
01:19:09,112 --> 01:19:11,079
You were doing your homework.

836
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:14,374
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

837
01:19:15,216 --> 01:19:16,843
What do you mean?

838
01:19:17,585 --> 01:19:19,245
I went someplace else.

839
01:19:19,419 --> 01:19:22,411
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

840
01:19:23,589 --> 01:19:26,353
...to buy a car, because I wanted...

841
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:29,519
...to impress Mary Jane.

842
01:19:31,662 --> 01:19:33,687
It happened so fast.

843
01:19:34,832 --> 01:19:38,699
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

844
01:19:40,202 --> 01:19:41,635
The thief...

845
01:19:42,637 --> 01:19:44,604
...was running towards me.

846
01:19:46,207 --> 01:19:49,004
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...

847
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,267
...revenge.

848
01:19:53,278 --> 01:19:54,802
I let him go.

849
01:19:56,714 --> 01:19:59,649
I let him get away.

850
01:20:05,488 --> 01:20:07,285
He wanted a car.

851
01:20:07,456 --> 01:20:09,719
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

852
01:20:10,992 --> 01:20:14,222
Uncle Ben said no...

853
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:17,889
...and then he shot him.

854
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:25,163
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

855
01:20:26,804 --> 01:20:29,863
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

856
01:20:33,076 --> 01:20:34,337
And I...

857
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,804
I held his hand...

858
01:20:40,415 --> 01:20:42,006
...when he died.

859
01:20:49,522 --> 01:20:52,547
I've tried to tell you so many times.

860
01:21:49,133 --> 01:21:51,192
Just one more little chore.

861
01:21:58,841 --> 01:22:00,240
Where are you?

862
01:22:02,443 --> 01:22:06,276
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.

863
01:22:06,446 --> 01:22:09,175
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

864
01:22:09,348 --> 01:22:10,940
Good night, Bernard.

865
01:23:04,323 --> 01:23:05,551
Hello, Harry.

866
01:23:05,725 --> 01:23:07,954
Otto. What do you want?

867
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,118
That precious tritium.

868
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:12,689
But I need more of it this time.

869
01:23:14,431 --> 01:23:18,423
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

870
01:23:22,337 --> 01:23:24,361
Hey! Hey!

871
01:23:24,539 --> 01:23:27,531
Stop! Stop! All right!

872
01:23:27,974 --> 01:23:31,705
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

873
01:23:41,618 --> 01:23:44,814
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

874
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:49,554
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

875
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:50,986
How do I find him?

876
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:53,954
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?

877
01:23:54,128 --> 01:23:56,392
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the Bugle.

878
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:58,053
Make him tell you where he is.

879
01:24:03,869 --> 01:24:05,130
Have it ready.

880
01:24:09,006 --> 01:24:10,563
Don't hurt Peter!

881
01:24:23,784 --> 01:24:26,217
Somebody, help!

882
01:24:27,153 --> 01:24:28,745
Fire!

883
01:24:36,927 --> 01:24:39,918
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?

884
01:24:41,331 --> 01:24:43,924
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

885
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,997
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?

886
01:24:47,168 --> 01:24:49,762
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

887
01:24:50,004 --> 01:24:51,664
Hey, where you going?!

888
01:25:12,854 --> 01:25:14,253
I'm coming!

889
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:41,638
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

890
01:25:41,809 --> 01:25:44,243
Come on. Come on.

891
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:46,458
Mama.

892
01:26:58,468 --> 01:27:00,025
You got some guts, kid.

893
01:27:00,202 --> 01:27:04,797
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

894
01:27:05,073 --> 01:27:06,540
Oh, man.

895
01:27:09,443 --> 01:27:12,900
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

896
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:16,946
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

897
01:27:22,653 --> 01:27:25,644
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

898
01:27:26,656 --> 01:27:28,122
What I need?

899
01:27:30,459 --> 01:27:32,892
What am I supposed to do?

900
01:27:39,566 --> 01:27:41,226
I shouldn't have without...

901
01:27:41,734 --> 01:27:42,996
...knocking.

902
01:27:47,572 --> 01:27:49,163
Come in.

903
01:27:52,242 --> 01:27:54,732
- Hi.
- Hi.

904
01:27:58,413 --> 01:28:01,007
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

905
01:28:03,016 --> 01:28:04,449
Okay.

906
01:28:05,885 --> 01:28:07,944
And a glass of milk?

907
01:28:10,689 --> 01:28:12,281
That would be nice.

908
01:28:14,391 --> 01:28:16,518
Okay.

909
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:38,540
Thank you.

910
01:28:43,313 --> 01:28:44,871
You got a message.

911
01:28:46,049 --> 01:28:47,515
It's your aunt.

912
01:28:47,683 --> 01:28:49,446
Thanks.

913
01:29:05,397 --> 01:29:06,728
What's going on?

914
01:29:06,899 --> 01:29:10,698
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

915
01:29:10,868 --> 01:29:14,530
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

916
01:29:14,771 --> 01:29:16,169
Why didn't you tell me?

917
01:29:16,338 --> 01:29:19,637
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

918
01:29:19,809 --> 01:29:23,209
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

919
01:29:23,378 --> 01:29:24,867
...and I'm giving him $5.

920
01:29:25,045 --> 01:29:26,637
That's Henry Jackson?

921
01:29:27,314 --> 01:29:29,406
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.

922
01:29:29,715 --> 01:29:33,150
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

923
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:38,084
Listen, about my last visit...

924
01:29:38,255 --> 01:29:40,621
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

925
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:45,351
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

926
01:29:48,831 --> 01:29:52,630
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

927
01:29:52,867 --> 01:29:54,731
And I'm proud of you.

928
01:29:55,802 --> 01:29:58,201
And I thank you, and I...

929
01:29:59,471 --> 01:30:01,802
I love you, Peter.

930
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:05,566
So very, very much.

931
01:30:25,024 --> 01:30:28,015
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

932
01:30:28,193 --> 01:30:31,059
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

933
01:30:34,131 --> 01:30:37,395
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.

934
01:30:37,567 --> 01:30:39,124
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

935
01:30:39,301 --> 01:30:40,632
You're getting tall.

936
01:30:40,803 --> 01:30:44,898
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

937
01:30:45,073 --> 01:30:48,098
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

938
01:30:49,176 --> 01:30:50,473
I used to.

939
01:30:50,644 --> 01:30:51,871
Where is he?

940
01:30:52,044 --> 01:30:56,309
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

941
01:30:58,283 --> 01:30:59,806
He...

942
01:31:01,852 --> 01:31:04,342
...quit.
- Why?

943
01:31:05,261 --> 01:31:07,161
Wanted to try other things.

944
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:08,921
He'll be back, right?

945
01:31:10,232 --> 01:31:11,494
I don't know.

946
01:31:12,933 --> 01:31:15,925
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

947
01:31:16,336 --> 01:31:18,099
Spider-Man.

948
01:31:18,271 --> 01:31:22,172
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.

949
01:31:22,341 --> 01:31:26,071
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

950
01:31:26,244 --> 01:31:28,303
...saving old girls like me.

951
01:31:28,478 --> 01:31:32,244
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

952
01:31:32,416 --> 01:31:35,282
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

953
01:31:35,451 --> 01:31:37,782
...setting examples for all of us.

954
01:31:38,253 --> 01:31:40,653
Everybody loves a hero.

955
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:44,390
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

956
01:31:44,558 --> 01:31:48,721
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

957
01:31:48,895 --> 01:31:50,589
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

958
01:31:50,762 --> 01:31:54,219
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

959
01:31:55,566 --> 01:31:58,796
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

960
01:31:59,569 --> 01:32:01,400
...that keeps us honest...

961
01:32:02,071 --> 01:32:03,732
...gives us strength...

962
01:32:04,073 --> 01:32:05,937
...makes us noble...

963
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:10,567
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.

964
01:32:11,745 --> 01:32:15,874
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

965
01:32:16,048 --> 01:32:18,811
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

966
01:32:20,585 --> 01:32:22,484
Even our dreams.

967
01:32:24,388 --> 01:32:27,117
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

968
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,724
...and he wonders where he's gone.

969
01:32:30,892 --> 01:32:32,792
He needs him.

970
01:32:37,164 --> 01:32:41,896
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

971
01:32:42,335 --> 01:32:44,529
But don't strain yourself.

972
01:32:44,703 --> 01:32:46,330
Okay.

973
01:33:05,052 --> 01:33:07,282
Strong focus on what I want.

974
01:33:37,309 --> 01:33:38,901
I'm back!

975
01:33:39,078 --> 01:33:40,409
I'm back!

976
01:33:58,025 --> 01:33:59,424
My back.

977
01:34:00,361 --> 01:34:01,726
My back.

978
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:30,213
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

979
01:34:30,784 --> 01:34:32,011
Peter Parker?

980
01:34:34,187 --> 01:34:35,414
Positive.

981
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:36,880
Thought he was your pal.

982
01:34:37,222 --> 01:34:39,553
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

983
01:34:40,457 --> 01:34:43,051
He's just a great big jerk.

984
01:34:43,393 --> 01:34:45,190
The world's full of great big jerks.

985
01:34:46,696 --> 01:34:48,458
You're adorable.

986
01:34:48,864 --> 01:34:50,456
It's just the uniform.

987
01:34:53,768 --> 01:34:55,860
Lean your head back for me.

988
01:34:56,169 --> 01:34:58,603
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

989
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,300
Just put my head back?

990
01:35:03,042 --> 01:35:04,633
Okay.

991
01:35:23,724 --> 01:35:25,213
Wow.

992
01:35:25,992 --> 01:35:27,755
I'm back on the moon.

993
01:35:32,397 --> 01:35:33,886
You up there with me?

994
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,841
- Hiya.
- Surprised?

995
01:35:57,016 --> 01:35:58,505
Very.

996
01:35:58,683 --> 01:36:00,241
Thanks for coming.

997
01:36:00,585 --> 01:36:02,518
Everything okay?

998
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,249
You might say so.

999
01:36:06,589 --> 01:36:10,354
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

1000
01:36:12,794 --> 01:36:15,455
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

1001
01:36:15,863 --> 01:36:19,764
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.

1002
01:36:21,368 --> 01:36:25,030
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

1003
01:36:25,204 --> 01:36:28,798
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

1004
01:36:29,641 --> 01:36:31,631
I was afraid to trust you.

1005
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:36,335
But I've been thinking about it...

1006
01:36:36,512 --> 01:36:40,174
Listen, there's more for me to say.

1007
01:36:43,851 --> 01:36:48,048
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...

1008
01:36:48,221 --> 01:36:50,849
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

1009
01:36:51,557 --> 01:36:53,353
I'm saying...

1010
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:02,521
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...

1011
01:37:03,033 --> 01:37:04,522
...but I can't.

1012
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:11,200
My mind was playing tricks too.

1013
01:37:15,909 --> 01:37:18,502
Do you love me, or not?

1014
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:27,176
I...

1015
01:37:30,486 --> 01:37:31,714
...don't.

1016
01:37:36,558 --> 01:37:38,491
You don't.

1017
01:37:48,033 --> 01:37:49,261
Kiss me.

1018
01:37:51,469 --> 01:37:52,959
Kiss you?

1019
01:37:53,137 --> 01:37:55,036
I need to know something.

1020
01:37:57,574 --> 01:37:59,165
Just one kiss.

1021
01:38:46,511 --> 01:38:48,444
What's happening?

1022
01:38:58,687 --> 01:39:00,313
Peter Parker...

1023
01:39:01,188 --> 01:39:02,985
...and the girlfriend.

1024
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:05,120
What do you want?

1025
01:39:07,961 --> 01:39:10,121
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

1026
01:39:10,295 --> 01:39:12,956
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

1027
01:39:13,131 --> 01:39:15,292
I don't know where he is.

1028
01:39:16,833 --> 01:39:18,391
Find him.

1029
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:23,502
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

1030
01:39:23,672 --> 01:39:25,662
If you lay one finger on her...

1031
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,171
You'll do what?

1032
01:40:40,897 --> 01:40:44,627
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

1033
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,392
Sorry, Jonah.

1034
01:40:47,470 --> 01:40:48,959
It's all my fault.

1035
01:40:50,738 --> 01:40:53,069
I drove Spider-Man away.

1036
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:56,502
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

1037
01:40:58,010 --> 01:40:59,238
Yes.

1038
01:41:00,879 --> 01:41:04,212
Spider-Man was a hero.

1039
01:41:05,416 --> 01:41:07,384
I just couldn't see it.

1040
01:41:08,985 --> 01:41:10,418
He was a...

1041
01:41:10,587 --> 01:41:13,316
A thief! A criminal!

1042
01:41:14,823 --> 01:41:17,120
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

1043
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:20,317
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

1044
01:41:20,495 --> 01:41:22,655
I want him strung up by his web!

1045
01:41:24,097 --> 01:41:26,758
I want Spider-Man!

1046
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:56,585
Where is she?

1047
01:41:56,755 --> 01:41:59,348
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

1048
01:42:50,596 --> 01:42:51,790
What the hell?

1049
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:45,919
You have a train to catch.

1050
01:45:48,497 --> 01:45:50,328
Help!

1051
01:45:50,498 --> 01:45:54,866
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

1052
01:46:13,616 --> 01:46:16,175
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!

1053
01:46:16,351 --> 01:46:17,750
Tell everyone to hang on!

1054
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,784
Brace yourselves!

1055
01:46:40,970 --> 01:46:43,302
Any more bright ideas?

1056
01:46:43,606 --> 01:46:46,005
I got a few, yeah!

1057
01:47:07,324 --> 01:47:09,155
Whoa, watch out!

1058
01:47:39,782 --> 01:47:41,044
We're slowing down.

1059
01:48:45,031 --> 01:48:46,999
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

1060
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,489
Slower. Gently.

1061
01:48:54,738 --> 01:48:56,069
Is he alive?

1062
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:01,073
He's...

1063
01:49:01,243 --> 01:49:02,835
...just a kid.

1064
01:49:04,012 --> 01:49:05,842
No older than my son.

1065
01:49:25,195 --> 01:49:26,991
It's all right.

1066
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:33,230
We found something.

1067
01:49:42,508 --> 01:49:44,668
We won't tell nobody.

1068
01:49:58,153 --> 01:50:00,848
It's good to have you back,
Spider-Man.

1069
01:50:20,670 --> 01:50:22,501
He's mine!

1070
01:50:23,306 --> 01:50:26,035
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

1071
01:50:26,375 --> 01:50:27,706
And me.

1072
01:50:28,309 --> 01:50:29,674
Me too.

1073
01:50:34,614 --> 01:50:36,172
Very well.

1074
01:51:05,171 --> 01:51:07,138
Where do you want him?

1075
01:51:14,945 --> 01:51:16,435
And the tritium?

1076
01:51:30,957 --> 01:51:32,424
Yes.

1077
01:52:02,448 --> 01:52:05,575
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

1078
01:52:08,251 --> 01:52:10,742
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

1079
01:52:10,921 --> 01:52:13,388
I can look into your eyes as you die.

1080
01:52:16,157 --> 01:52:17,681
Pete.

1081
01:52:18,059 --> 01:52:19,754
No.

1082
01:52:20,361 --> 01:52:21,760
It can't be.

1083
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:29,630
Harry.

1084
01:52:31,169 --> 01:52:34,604
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

1085
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:39,898
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.

1086
01:52:40,677 --> 01:52:41,938
Tritium?

1087
01:52:43,946 --> 01:52:45,936
He's making the machine again.

1088
01:52:46,781 --> 01:52:51,012
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

1089
01:52:51,184 --> 01:52:53,947
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...

1090
01:52:55,121 --> 01:52:56,952
...you killed my father.

1091
01:53:02,126 --> 01:53:06,221
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

1092
01:53:06,963 --> 01:53:09,727
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

1093
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:22,035
Hey!

1094
01:53:23,108 --> 01:53:24,769
Hey!

1095
01:53:26,178 --> 01:53:27,940
I'm talking to you!

1096
01:53:28,279 --> 01:53:31,770
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

1097
01:53:31,948 --> 01:53:33,813
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

1098
01:53:33,984 --> 01:53:36,543
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

1099
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,952
He's not dead.

1100
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:41,848
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.

1101
01:53:59,602 --> 01:54:00,933
Surprise.

1102
01:54:05,374 --> 01:54:07,001
As soon as you get free...

1103
01:54:09,177 --> 01:54:13,135
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

1104
01:54:13,313 --> 01:54:16,406
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1105
01:54:16,582 --> 01:54:18,914
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

1106
01:54:20,052 --> 01:54:21,916
Well, I'm not.

1107
01:54:54,444 --> 01:54:55,672
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1108
01:55:11,624 --> 01:55:12,852
Run!

1109
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:39,741
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1110
01:56:03,597 --> 01:56:05,826
Now what?

1111
01:56:35,922 --> 01:56:38,048
Dr. Octavius.

1112
01:56:41,225 --> 01:56:42,453
We have to shut it down.

1113
01:56:43,327 --> 01:56:44,885
Please tell me how.

1114
01:56:45,062 --> 01:56:46,494
Peter Parker?

1115
01:56:50,065 --> 01:56:52,090
"Brilliant but lazy."

1116
01:56:52,434 --> 01:56:53,832
Look at what's happening.

1117
01:56:54,835 --> 01:56:56,769
We must destroy it.

1118
01:57:02,341 --> 01:57:03,933
I can't destroy it.

1119
01:57:09,214 --> 01:57:10,544
I won't.

1120
01:57:16,118 --> 01:57:18,245
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1121
01:57:20,188 --> 01:57:23,884
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1122
01:57:25,593 --> 01:57:26,991
A privilege.

1123
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:30,720
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1124
01:57:31,763 --> 01:57:33,628
Don't listen to them.

1125
01:57:39,502 --> 01:57:41,060
It was my dream.

1126
01:57:41,238 --> 01:57:45,731
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1127
01:57:45,908 --> 01:57:48,398
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

1128
01:57:49,244 --> 01:57:50,905
Even our dreams.

1129
01:57:56,916 --> 01:57:58,543
You're right.

1130
01:58:05,956 --> 01:58:07,821
He's right.

1131
01:58:09,559 --> 01:58:11,151
Listen.

1132
01:58:13,362 --> 01:58:15,626
Listen to me now.

1133
01:58:18,532 --> 01:58:20,829
Listen to me now.

1134
01:58:24,571 --> 01:58:27,539
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1135
01:58:28,641 --> 01:58:30,301
It can't be stopped.

1136
01:58:31,709 --> 01:58:33,801
It's self-sustaining now.

1137
01:58:33,977 --> 01:58:36,036
- Think!
- Unless...

1138
01:58:37,613 --> 01:58:39,342
The river.

1139
01:58:40,716 --> 01:58:42,307
Drown it.

1140
01:58:44,286 --> 01:58:45,616
I'll do it.

1141
01:59:30,921 --> 01:59:33,650
No!

1142
01:59:45,665 --> 01:59:47,257
Hi.

1143
01:59:47,933 --> 01:59:49,560
Hi.

1144
01:59:50,369 --> 01:59:51,733
This is really heavy.

1145
02:00:16,389 --> 02:00:18,356
M.J.

1146
02:00:19,224 --> 02:00:21,020
In case we die...

1147
02:00:21,192 --> 02:00:22,750
You do love me.

1148
02:00:23,327 --> 02:00:24,555
I do.

1149
02:00:25,528 --> 02:00:27,587
Even though you said you didn't.

1150
02:00:30,532 --> 02:00:33,000
I will not die a monster.

1151
02:01:38,284 --> 02:01:40,342
I think I always knew...

1152
02:01:41,420 --> 02:01:43,047
...all this time...

1153
02:01:44,221 --> 02:01:46,018
...who you really were.

1154
02:01:46,624 --> 02:01:49,183
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1155
02:01:50,393 --> 02:01:53,361
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1156
02:01:55,197 --> 02:01:57,892
I can't let you take that risk.

1157
02:02:02,602 --> 02:02:03,967
I will...

1158
02:02:05,638 --> 02:02:07,902
...always be Spider-Man.

1159
02:02:10,675 --> 02:02:13,142
You and I can never be.

1160
02:03:01,414 --> 02:03:03,404
Mary Jane!

1161
02:04:06,496 --> 02:04:08,157
Hello?

1162
02:04:24,176 --> 02:04:25,506
Who's that?

1163
02:04:25,677 --> 02:04:27,611
Son.

1164
02:04:28,713 --> 02:04:30,236
I'm here.

1165
02:04:31,382 --> 02:04:33,009
Dad?

1166
02:04:34,083 --> 02:04:36,278
- I thought you were...
- No.

1167
02:04:36,786 --> 02:04:38,878
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1168
02:04:39,054 --> 02:04:40,419
Now it's your turn.

1169
02:04:41,989 --> 02:04:44,651
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1170
02:04:45,026 --> 02:04:46,686
Now make him pay.

1171
02:04:46,993 --> 02:04:48,654
But Pete's my best friend.

1172
02:04:48,828 --> 02:04:50,419
And I'm your father.

1173
02:04:51,397 --> 02:04:52,830
You're weak.

1174
02:04:53,832 --> 02:04:58,165
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1175
02:04:59,236 --> 02:05:02,069
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1176
02:05:03,005 --> 02:05:04,495
Be strong, Harry.

1177
02:05:05,541 --> 02:05:06,939
Avenge me.

1178
02:05:09,744 --> 02:05:11,768
- Avenge me!
- No!

1179
02:07:36,422 --> 02:07:37,821
Call Deborah.

1180
02:07:37,990 --> 02:07:39,821
The caterer?

1181
02:07:40,825 --> 02:07:42,918
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1182
02:08:24,292 --> 02:08:26,452
Had to do what I had to do.

1183
02:08:28,128 --> 02:08:29,459
Mary Jane.

1184
02:08:30,629 --> 02:08:31,891
Peter.

1185
02:08:33,132 --> 02:08:35,565
I can't survive without you.

1186
02:08:45,575 --> 02:08:47,405
You shouldn't be here.

1187
02:08:48,510 --> 02:08:51,569
I know you think we can't be together.

1188
02:08:52,646 --> 02:08:56,342
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1189
02:08:57,617 --> 02:08:59,345
I know there'll be risks.

1190
02:09:00,285 --> 02:09:02,845
But I want to face them with you.

1191
02:09:04,021 --> 02:09:07,387
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1192
02:09:07,557 --> 02:09:09,320
...half of ourselves.

1193
02:09:11,794 --> 02:09:13,386
I love you.

1194
02:09:15,663 --> 02:09:18,632
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

1195
02:09:20,367 --> 02:09:23,461
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1196
02:09:30,509 --> 02:09:34,035
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1197
02:09:39,983 --> 02:09:41,813
Well, say something.

1198
02:09:44,319 --> 02:09:46,809
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1199
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,763
Go get them, tiger.
