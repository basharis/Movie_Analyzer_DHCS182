1
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:08,561
Part Two

2
00:00:10,646 --> 00:00:16,403
STALKER

3
00:00:19,206 --> 00:00:22,084
Where are you?
Come here!

4
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:28,685
Are you tired?

5
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:45,524
Oh, God!

6
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:53,243
Judging by his tone, he's going to
start sermonizing again.

7
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:14,560
Let everything that's been planned
come true.

8
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:17,763
Let them believe.

9
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:22,479
And let them have a laugh
at their passions.

10
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:27,245
Because what they call passion
actually is not some emotional energy,

11
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:30,723
but just the friction between
their souls and the outside world.

12
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:35,004
And most important,
let them believe in themselves

13
00:01:36,126 --> 00:01:39,084
let them be helpless like children,

14
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:43,481
because weakness is a great thing,
and strength is nothing.

15
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:51,164
When a man is just born,
he is weak and flexible,

16
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:54,560
when he dies,
he is hard and insensitive.

17
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:59,004
When a tree is growing,
it's tender and pliant,

18
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:03,405
but when it's dry and hard,
it dies.

19
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:08,605
Hardness and strength
are death's companions.

20
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:13,756
Pliancy and weakness are
expressions of the freshness of being.

21
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:19,564
Because what has hardened
will never win.

22
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:43,835
Come here!
We're progressing well.

23
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:46,594
Soon we'll come to a dry tunnel,
after that it will get easier.

24
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:48,604
Knock on wood.

25
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:53,402
- Are we on our way already?
- Of course. Why?

26
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:58,077
l thoughtyou just wanted
to show us something.

27
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:01,598
- What about my knapsack?
- What about it?

28
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,594
l left it there.
l didn't know we were going.

29
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:10,404
- There's nothing we can do about it.
- No, we have to go back.

30
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:13,160
- lt's impossible!
- l can't do without my knapsack!

31
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:17,405
Can'tyou understand that no one here
has ever come back the same way?

32
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,756
Forget aboutyour knapsack.
What have you got there, diamonds?

33
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:26,322
The room will give you
anything you want.

34
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:30,314
Really. lt will drown you
in knapsacks.

35
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:32,676
Howfar is it, this room?

36
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:37,596
lf you go straight, about 200 meters,
but there's no going straight here.

37
00:03:37,846 --> 00:03:38,995
Let's go.

38
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:45,759
Give up your empiricism, Professor.
Miracles are outside empiricism.

39
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:50,764
Remember how St. Peter
was nearly drowned?

40
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:56,605
Go, Writer.

41
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:00,000
Go where?

42
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:02,398
Up these stairs.

43
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:14,402
Professor, where are you?

44
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:03,162
Here is the dry tunnel!

45
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,402
You call it dry?

46
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:11,596
This is a local joke.
Normally one has to swim here.

47
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,596
Wait, where's Professor?

48
00:06:41,806 --> 00:06:44,843
- What?
- Professor has disappeared!

49
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:49,164
How could it happen?
He was following you all the way.

50
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:53,243
He probably lagged behind and
lost his way.

51
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,916
No, he didn't lose his way!
He must've gone for the knapsack!

52
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,084
He won't be able to make it now.

53
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:01,754
Shall we wait for him?

54
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:06,801
We can't. Things change here
every minute. We'll have to go.

55
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:37,846
Look! What is it? How could it be?

56
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:41,482
- l already explained.
- What did you explain?

57
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:46,999
lt's the Zone, don'tyou understand?
Let's go, quick. lt's...

58
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,320
There he is!

59
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:24,995
l'm certainly grateful to you
thatyou... but...

60
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:26,765
How did you get here?

61
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:34,758
Mostly l had to crawl up here
on my fours.

62
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:38,605
lncredible.
How did you manage to overtake us?

63
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:45,677
What do you mean, ''overtake''?
l came back here for the knapsack.

64
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:49,921
And how has our nut gotten here?

65
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:56,837
Oh, my God, that's...
the trap!

66
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,685
Porcupine put this nut here
on purpose.

67
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:12,004
How could the Zone let us through?

68
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:22,914
Oh God, l'm not going
to take one more step until...

69
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:25,559
l don't like it.

70
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:34,401
That's it! We rest!

71
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:51,004
But keep off this nut,
just in case.

72
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:56,085
Sorry, but l thought that
Professor won't be able to make it.

73
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:57,601
You see, l...

74
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:02,995
l never know beforehand what kind
of people l'm taking with me.

75
00:10:03,526 --> 00:10:07,758
Everything gets clear only here,
when it's too late.

76
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:14,085
What's important is that Professor's
bag with his underwear is safe.

77
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:19,916
Don't stick your nose in someone's
underwear if you don't understand it.

78
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,996
What is there to understand?
Binomial theorem?

79
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:29,085
Some psychological abysses!

80
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:31,835
You have a bad reputation
atyour institute.

81
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:34,560
They don't give you money
for an expedition.

82
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:39,757
So you decide to pack a knapsack
full of manometers and other shit...

83
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:43,516
penetrate the Zone illegally...

84
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,561
and put all these miracles
to an algebra test.

85
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:53,164
No one in the world
has ever heard of the Zone.

86
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:55,596
So we'll work a sure sensation!

87
00:10:56,726 --> 00:11:02,005
The television, fans raving
and bringing laurel wreaths.

88
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:07,243
Here our Professor appears,
all in white,

89
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:12,038
and declares:
''Mene-mene, tekel, uprasin.''

90
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,595
Everyone gaping

91
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:19,924
and shouting:
''He deserves a Nobel Prize!''

92
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:27,879
You lousy scribbler,
a homespun psychoanalyst.

93
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:34,403
You're only good for painting walls
in public toilets, you blabbermouth.

94
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:39,241
No good. Too sluggish.

95
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,161
You don't know howto do it.

96
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:46,604
All right. l'm going to get
a Nobel Prize.

97
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:51,758
And what are you after?
Want to bless mankind

98
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:55,322
with the pearls
of your purchased inspiration?

99
00:11:56,726 --> 00:12:00,514
l don't care a damn about mankind.
Of all your mankind

100
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:05,402
l'm interested
only in one man - myself.

101
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:10,404
Whether l'm worth anything
or l'm just shit like others.

102
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:15,242
And if you find out
thatyou're really...

103
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:20,156
You know, Mr. Einstein,
l have no wish to argue with you.

104
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:27,085
Truth is born of argument,
damn it!

105
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,845
Listen, Chingachgook...

106
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:39,995
You've brought here
many people.

107
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:44,315
Not as many as l would like.

108
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:50,238
That's not the point. Why did they
come here? What did they want?

109
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:52,323
Happiness, l guess.

110
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:56,201
Yes, but what kind of happiness?

111
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:01,320
People don't like to speak about
their innermost feelings.

112
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:05,685
And it's neither yours
nor mine business.

113
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,161
ln any case, you've been lucky.

114
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:13,321
As for me, l haven't seen
one happy man in my life.

115
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:15,239
Me neither.

116
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,844
They return from the room
and l lead them back,

117
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:21,676
and we never see each other again.

118
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:26,559
lt's not that wishes come true
immediately.

119
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:33,756
Have you ever wished
to use this room yourself?

120
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:40,243
l'm fine as l am.

121
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:32,836
Listen, Professor.

122
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:38,117
Speaking of the purchased inspiration.

123
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:43,086
Let's imagine that l enter this room

124
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:47,484
and return to our God-forsaken
town a genius.

125
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:58,597
A man writes because he's tormented,
because he doubts.

126
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:04,685
He needs to constantly prove
to himself and the others

127
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:06,558
that he's worth something.

128
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,999
And if l knowfor sure
that l'm a genius?

129
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,323
Why write then?

130
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:20,239
What the hell for?

131
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:26,078
Well, l must say

132
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:28,926
that we exist for...

133
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:32,243
Will you be so kind
and leave me alone?

134
00:15:34,126 --> 00:15:38,085
Let me get a wink,
l haven't slept all night.

135
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,481
Keep your complexes to yourself.

136
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:47,235
ln any case,
all this technology of yours...

137
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,921
all those blast furnaces, wheels...

138
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:58,845
and other bullshit

139
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:02,442
are only designed in order
to work less and eat more.

140
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:06,765
They are all just crutches,
artificial limbs.

141
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:13,241
And mankind exists
in order to create...

142
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,842
works of art.

143
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:24,760
Unlike all other human activities,
this one is unselfish.

144
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:31,915
Great illusions!
lmages of the absolute truth!

145
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:36,161
Are you listening to me, Professor?

146
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:40,400
What unselfishness are you talking
about?

147
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:44,834
People still die of hunger.
Have you fallen from the moon?

148
00:16:54,286 --> 00:16:57,323
And they are considered to be
our brainy aristocracy!

149
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:02,164
You're not even capable of thinking
in abstractions.

150
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:09,244
Are you going to teach me
about the meaning of life?

151
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:14,562
And also howto think?

152
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:21,437
lt's useless. You might be
a professor, but an ignorant one.

153
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:13,598
And there was
a great earthquake.

154
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:18,163
And the sun became black
as sackcloth made of hair.

155
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:21,322
And the moon became like blood...

156
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:26,597
And the stars of the sky
fell to the earth,

157
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:30,914
as a fig tree casts
its unripe figs

158
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:34,402
when shaken by a great wind.

159
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:38,756
And the sky was split apart
like a scroll when it is rolled up.

160
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:45,760
And every mountain and island
were moved out of their places.

161
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:54,163
And the kings of the earth and
the great men

162
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:58,994
and the rich and the chiliarchs

163
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:04,235
and the strong and every free man,

164
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:08,595
hid themselves in the caves
and among the rocks of the mountains;

165
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:12,845
and they said to the mountains and
to the rocks, ''Fall on us

166
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:16,755
and hide us from the presence of
Him who sits on the throne,

167
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:19,596
and from the wrath of the Lamb,

168
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:23,483
for the great day of His wrath
has come,

169
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:27,916
and who is able to stand?''

170
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:23,923
And that very day two...

171
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:26,999
two of them...

172
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:32,994
were going to a village
which was about 60 stadia from...

173
00:22:34,046 --> 00:22:35,320
named...

174
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,763
and they were conversing with each
other about all these things.

175
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:43,324
And while they were conversing
and discussing...

176
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:47,314
He Himself approached,
and began travelling with them.

177
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:52,005
But their eyes were prevented
from recognizing Him.

178
00:22:53,446 --> 00:22:55,402
And He said to them:
''What are these words...

179
00:22:58,046 --> 00:23:01,482
you are exchanging with one another,
and why are you sad?''

180
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:03,685
And one of them, named...

181
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,761
Are you awake?

182
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:27,002
You were speaking of the meaning...

183
00:23:28,526 --> 00:23:30,756
of our... life...

184
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:33,763
of the unselfishness of art...

185
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:39,323
Take music, for instance.

186
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:48,244
Less than anything else,
it is connected to reality,

187
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:52,755
or if connected at all, it's done
mechanically, not by way of ideas,

188
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:56,595
just by a sheer sound, devoid of...
any associations.

189
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:06,919
And yet, music, as if by some miracle,
gets through to our heart.

190
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:14,234
What is it that resonates in us in
response to noise brought to harmony,

191
00:24:15,206 --> 00:24:19,165
making it the source
of the greatest delight

192
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:21,926
which stuns us and brings us
together?

193
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:27,485
What's all this needed for?
And most important, who needs it?

194
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:34,235
You would say,
''No one. And for no reason.''

195
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:35,755
Unselfishly.

196
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:38,675
No.

197
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:41,561
l don't think so.

198
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:47,004
After all,
everything has some sense.

199
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:52,242
Sense and reason.

200
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:23,597
Do we have to go there?

201
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:30,005
Unfortunately, yes.
There's no other way.

202
00:25:45,286 --> 00:25:49,165
lt looks morbid, don'tyou think,
Professor?

203
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:55,846
l don't feel like going there first.

204
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:59,605
And Chingachgooks
can never be volunteers.

205
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:05,838
l think we'll have to draw lots.
Do you mind?

206
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:09,604
For this, l would rather have
a volunteer.

207
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:13,605
Have you got matches?

208
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:22,721
Thanks.

209
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:36,239
The long one will go.

210
00:26:39,646 --> 00:26:40,601
Pull it.

211
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:51,002
The long one.
No luck this time.

212
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:08,240
Why don'tyou throw one of your nuts
at least?

213
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:10,604
Sure. As you wish.

214
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:47,921
One more?

215
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,595
All right... l'll go.

216
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:44,999
Hurry up, Professor!

217
00:33:45,286 --> 00:33:51,919
There's... There's a door here!

218
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:13,078
Go that way!
Open the door and go in!

219
00:34:21,366 --> 00:34:24,517
Me again?
Do l have to go in first again?

220
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:30,314
You've drawn the lot.
Go! People don't wait here.

221
00:34:35,046 --> 00:34:38,834
What have you got there?
No guns here!

222
00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:42,001
You'll have yourself killed,
and us too!

223
00:34:42,526 --> 00:34:44,005
Don'tyou remember the tanks?

224
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:46,844
Drop it, l beg you.

225
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:49,002
Don'tyou understand?

226
00:34:50,446 --> 00:34:54,405
lf something happens,
l can save you, but not this way...

227
00:34:55,966 --> 00:35:02,314
l beg you!
Who are you going to fire at?

228
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:17,401
Go, we haven't got much time!

229
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:22,754
There's water here!

230
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:26,606
Hold on to the handrail and go down.

231
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:14,995
But don't go anywhere!
Wait for us outside!

232
00:36:29,126 --> 00:36:31,082
l hope you haven't got anything
like that?

233
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:34,606
- Like what?
- Like a gun.

234
00:36:35,046 --> 00:36:37,765
No. As a last resort
l've got an ampule.

235
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:42,844
- What ampule?
- lmplanted ampule. Poison!

236
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:46,124
Oh, God! Did you come here to die?

237
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,680
No, it's just in case.

238
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:22,844
Writer! Come back!

239
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:25,481
Come back! You want to getyourself
killed?

240
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:30,077
l told you to wait by the exit!
Stop! Don't move!

241
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:16,164
That's all your pipe.

242
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:20,245
- Why?
- You should've gone in there first.

243
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:24,324
He was so scared that he went
the wrong way.

244
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:09,004
One more experiment.

245
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:16,754
Experiments, facts,
truth of the highest instance.

246
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:21,757
There's no such thing as facts.
Especially here.

247
00:40:23,366 --> 00:40:27,837
All this is someone's
idiotic invention.

248
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:30,002
Don'tyou feel it?

249
00:40:32,446 --> 00:40:35,404
Butyou, of course, must find out
whose invention it is.

250
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,239
And why.

251
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:42,676
What good can your knowledge do?

252
00:40:42,966 --> 00:40:46,925
Who is going to get guilty conscience
because of it? Me?

253
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:51,402
l've got no conscience.
l just got nerves.

254
00:40:52,206 --> 00:40:55,004
Some bastard would criticize me,
l get wounded.

255
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,480
Another would loud me,
l get wounded again.

256
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:03,996
l would put my heart and soul in it,
they gobble up both my heart and soul.

257
00:41:06,126 --> 00:41:09,084
l would relieve my soul of filth,
they gobble it up too.

258
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:12,561
They're all so literate.

259
00:41:14,446 --> 00:41:17,165
They all got sensory deficiency.

260
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:22,518
And they're all swarming around,
journalists,

261
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:27,561
editors, critics,
some endless broads.

262
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:31,164
And they all demand:
more, more!

263
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:39,839
What hell of a writer am l
if l hate writing?

264
00:41:41,886 --> 00:41:45,765
lf it's constant torment for me,
a painful, shameful occupation,

265
00:41:45,966 --> 00:41:48,241
sort of squeezing out a hemorrhoids.

266
00:41:51,606 --> 00:41:54,996
l used to think that someone would
get better because of my books.

267
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,084
No, nobody needs me!

268
00:41:57,966 --> 00:42:02,244
ln two days after l die they'll start
gobbling up someone else.

269
00:42:05,646 --> 00:42:09,400
l wanted to change them,
but it's they who've changed me.

270
00:42:09,886 --> 00:42:12,320
Making me in their own image.

271
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:21,677
The future used to be just
a continuation of the present,

272
00:42:21,966 --> 00:42:25,481
with all the changes looming far
behind the horizon.

273
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:29,164
Nowthe future and the present
are one.

274
00:42:36,526 --> 00:42:38,676
Are they ready for it?

275
00:42:39,526 --> 00:42:43,599
They don't want to know anything!
All they know is howto gobble!

276
00:42:57,646 --> 00:42:59,159
Gosh, how lucky you are!

277
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:04,837
My goodness, now...
You're going to live a hundred years!

278
00:43:18,366 --> 00:43:22,154
Yes. But why not forever?

279
00:43:25,286 --> 00:43:26,765
Like the eternal Jew.

280
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,321
You are probably a fine man.

281
00:44:09,526 --> 00:44:11,244
l almost didn't doubt it.

282
00:44:11,966 --> 00:44:15,675
l can imagine what torture it was
for you being in there.

283
00:44:17,046 --> 00:44:20,243
This pipe is a horrible place!
The most horrible in the Zone!

284
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:23,244
lt's called ''the meat mincer'',
but it's much worse than any mincer.

285
00:44:23,646 --> 00:44:25,398
So many people perished there!

286
00:44:30,366 --> 00:44:33,517
Porcupine sent his brother
to die there.

287
00:44:36,886 --> 00:44:38,922
The boy was so delicate,
very talented.

288
00:44:41,526 --> 00:44:42,845
Here, listen to this.

289
00:44:44,806 --> 00:44:48,765
So summer is gone,
Leaving no epitaph.

290
00:44:49,886 --> 00:44:53,845
lt's still warm in the sun,
Only that's not enough.

291
00:44:54,886 --> 00:44:56,842
All that true could have come,

292
00:44:57,526 --> 00:45:01,599
Like a five-fingered fluff,
Folded into my palm,

293
00:45:02,646 --> 00:45:04,602
Only that's not enough.

294
00:45:05,646 --> 00:45:09,764
No evil was slighted
ln the good aftermath,

295
00:45:10,726 --> 00:45:14,924
World was festively lighted,
Only that's not enough.

296
00:45:15,886 --> 00:45:20,243
Life forever was tucking,
Caring, making me laugh.

297
00:45:21,046 --> 00:45:25,085
l was really lucky,
Only that's not enough.

298
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:30,518
No leaves ever seared,
No limbs broken rough.

299
00:45:31,446 --> 00:45:36,236
Day, like glass, washed all clear,
Only that's not enough.

300
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:40,926
Good, aren't they?
That's his verses.

301
00:45:41,126 --> 00:45:44,562
Why do you fidget?
Fussing all the time?

302
00:45:45,126 --> 00:45:47,082
- l'm just...
- l get sick just looking atyou!

303
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:52,076
l'm so happy! lt's not often that
everyone who goes makes it.

304
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:56,165
You did everything right.
You're good, kind, honest people.

305
00:45:56,366 --> 00:45:57,685
l'm proud that l was right aboutyou.

306
00:45:57,886 --> 00:46:01,083
Look at him! He's happy
that everything ended well!

307
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:05,765
Fate! Zone!
l'm a fine man, he says!

308
00:46:06,126 --> 00:46:08,765
You think l didn't see how you
shoved the two long matches at me?

309
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,434
- No, you don't understand...
- Of course, how could l?

310
00:46:11,646 --> 00:46:15,434
l'm sorry, Professor,
no offense meant,

311
00:46:15,646 --> 00:46:17,602
but this jerk has chosen you
to be his favorite.

312
00:46:17,806 --> 00:46:19,000
Come on, it's unfair!

313
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:22,843
And me, a second-rate creature,
he shoves into that pipe!

314
00:46:23,806 --> 00:46:26,001
Meat mincer! To think of such
a word!

315
00:46:27,206 --> 00:46:29,242
What right have you got to decide

316
00:46:29,446 --> 00:46:31,835
who is to live and
who is to go into the meat mincer?

317
00:46:32,046 --> 00:46:34,002
You've chosen ityourself!

318
00:46:34,206 --> 00:46:38,245
What? One long match out of the two
long ones?

319
00:46:38,886 --> 00:46:40,558
The matches are nothing.

320
00:46:40,886 --> 00:46:43,719
The Zone had letyou through
earlier, under the nut,

321
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:47,760
so it became clear that only you
could go through the meat mincer.

322
00:46:48,366 --> 00:46:49,321
And we just followed you.

323
00:46:49,526 --> 00:46:50,481
Well, it's too much...

324
00:46:51,606 --> 00:46:56,077
You can't even imagine how dangerous
it is to make a mistake here.

325
00:46:57,126 --> 00:46:59,082
But someone had to be first!

326
00:46:59,646 --> 00:47:02,843
Yes? No, it's not a clinic!

327
00:47:04,646 --> 00:47:08,241
You see, someone has to go first!

328
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:15,921
Don't touch it!

329
00:47:36,966 --> 00:47:39,082
Laboratory nine, please.

330
00:47:40,366 --> 00:47:41,685
Just a minute.

331
00:47:48,046 --> 00:47:50,606
- Hello?
- l hope l'm not disturbing you.

332
00:47:51,206 --> 00:47:54,994
- What do you want?
- Just a few words with you.

333
00:47:55,366 --> 00:47:57,834
You've hidden it. l've found it.

334
00:47:58,046 --> 00:48:03,404
The old building. Bunker four.
Do you hear me?

335
00:48:03,606 --> 00:48:05,915
l'm alerting the security
immediately.

336
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:11,246
You may do it.
You may inform on me,

337
00:48:11,446 --> 00:48:15,405
you may set my colleagues against me,
but it's too late.

338
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:21,004
l'm now at a stone's throw
from that place.

339
00:48:21,806 --> 00:48:24,320
Do you realize that's the end of you
as a scientist?

340
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,561
Well, you may rejoice!

341
00:48:25,806 --> 00:48:28,843
Do you realize what will happen
if you dare?

342
00:48:31,046 --> 00:48:32,320
Trying to scare me again?

343
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:39,766
All my life l've been afraid of
something. Even of you.

344
00:48:40,526 --> 00:48:43,324
But now l'm not afraid of anything,
l assure you.

345
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:46,764
Oh God, you are not even
a Herostratos.

346
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:50,244
lt's just thatyou've always wanted
to make my life unbearable

347
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:53,006
because twenty years ago
l slept with your wife.

348
00:48:54,126 --> 00:48:57,755
And now you're delighted
thatyou've made even with me.

349
00:48:58,206 --> 00:49:02,324
Well, go and do your...
vile thing.

350
00:49:03,366 --> 00:49:05,084
Don'tyou dare hang up on me!

351
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:09,684
Prison is not the worst thing
expecting you.

352
00:49:10,206 --> 00:49:13,004
The worst is thatyou'll never be
able to forgive yourself for this.

353
00:49:13,206 --> 00:49:17,484
l already see you hanging from your
suspenders in your prison cell.

354
00:49:20,526 --> 00:49:23,916
What are you up to, Professor?

355
00:49:25,126 --> 00:49:29,677
Do you realize what will happen
when everybody believes in the room?

356
00:49:31,366 --> 00:49:34,164
And all come rushing here?

357
00:49:35,126 --> 00:49:38,835
lt's only a question of time.

358
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:42,357
lf not today, then tomorrow!
And not just tens of them, thousands!

359
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:47,162
Unfulfilled emperors,
great inquisitors, fuhrers,

360
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,996
self-appointed benefactors
of the human race!

361
00:49:51,646 --> 00:49:55,958
And they'll come not for money or
inspiration, but to change the world!

362
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:57,918
l never take here people like that.
You think l don't understand it?

363
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:00,765
What on earth can you understand?

364
00:50:01,726 --> 00:50:03,842
You're not the only stalker
on Earth.

365
00:50:04,446 --> 00:50:06,323
No stalker can know

366
00:50:06,526 --> 00:50:10,155
what those you lead bring with them
and what they take from here.

367
00:50:10,806 --> 00:50:13,525
And the number of unmotivated
crimes is on the rise!

368
00:50:13,726 --> 00:50:15,239
lsn't thatyour doing?

369
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:20,315
Take coups d'etat by the military,
or the mafia penetrating governments,

370
00:50:20,526 --> 00:50:22,084
aren't they all your clients?

371
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:26,599
Or lasers and all those
super-bacteria,

372
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:31,004
all that filth, kept for the time being
in safes?

373
00:50:31,206 --> 00:50:33,845
Will you please stop this
sociological diarrhea?

374
00:50:34,206 --> 00:50:36,162
Can you really believe
in all those fairy tales?

375
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:40,757
Not in the good ones, no!
But in the bad ones, certainly!

376
00:50:41,046 --> 00:50:42,684
Come on!

377
00:50:43,046 --> 00:50:47,756
A human being is not capable
of such hatred or love...

378
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:51,559
that would extend over
the whole of mankind.

379
00:50:52,726 --> 00:50:55,843
Well, money, a woman,
maybe a desire for revenge,

380
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:59,676
let my boss be overrun by a car,
that l can understand.

381
00:51:00,526 --> 00:51:03,404
But ruling over the world!
A just society!

382
00:51:03,606 --> 00:51:05,324
God's kingdom on earth!

383
00:51:05,886 --> 00:51:10,596
These are not just wishes,
this is ideology, action, concepts.

384
00:51:12,046 --> 00:51:15,925
Unconscious compassion
is not ready for realization yet.

385
00:51:17,126 --> 00:51:19,845
As a regular
instinctive impulse.

386
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:24,165
There cannot be happiness
at someone else's expense.

387
00:51:25,366 --> 00:51:27,163
l can see quite clearly now

388
00:51:27,366 --> 00:51:31,917
thatyou plan to overwhelm
mankind with good deeds.

389
00:51:33,286 --> 00:51:37,165
As for me, l'm not a bit worried
aboutyou or myself,

390
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:39,561
and least of all about mankind.

391
00:51:40,886 --> 00:51:43,161
Because you're not going
to achieve anything.

392
00:51:44,366 --> 00:51:47,915
At bestyou'll getyour Nobel Prize.

393
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:54,406
Or rather you'll get something
absolutely incongruous,

394
00:51:54,606 --> 00:51:58,485
something you don't even think about.
Something like this telephone...

395
00:52:00,446 --> 00:52:04,485
You dream of one thing,
butyou get quite another.

396
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:07,675
Why did you do that?

397
00:52:21,886 --> 00:52:25,322
Telephone... electricity...

398
00:52:29,126 --> 00:52:31,765
Look, very good sleeping pills.

399
00:52:32,606 --> 00:52:35,916
They don't make ones like that any
longer. Why so many of them here?

400
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:41,924
Maybe we'd better be going?

401
00:52:43,206 --> 00:52:47,324
lt will be dark soon,
difficult to come back.

402
00:52:54,286 --> 00:52:57,835
By the way, it's absolutely clear
to me

403
00:52:58,046 --> 00:53:02,164
that all this poem reciting
and making detours

404
00:53:02,366 --> 00:53:04,755
is just a form of apologizing.

405
00:53:05,046 --> 00:53:10,757
l can understand you.
Difficult childhood, bad environment...

406
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:18,315
But don't have any illusions,
l'm not going to forgive you.

407
00:53:19,286 --> 00:53:21,402
Will you please stop it,
do me a favor.

408
00:54:11,966 --> 00:54:15,003
Professor, come here, please.

409
00:54:47,366 --> 00:54:50,676
Wait a minute.
Don't be in a hurry.

410
00:54:51,046 --> 00:54:53,002
l'm in no hurry whatsoever.

411
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:43,762
l know, you're going to get mad.

412
00:55:46,806 --> 00:55:48,762
Anyway, l must tell you...

413
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:59,997
We are now...
on the threshold...

414
00:56:07,526 --> 00:56:12,156
This is the most important moment
in your life.

415
00:56:15,566 --> 00:56:16,999
You must knowthat...

416
00:56:18,806 --> 00:56:23,561
Your innermost wishes
will be made real here.

417
00:56:25,446 --> 00:56:30,759
Your most sincere wish!
Born of suffering!

418
00:56:58,886 --> 00:57:00,478
No need to say anything.

419
00:57:04,126 --> 00:57:05,241
You just have to...

420
00:57:07,806 --> 00:57:12,482
concentrate
and try to recall your whole life.

421
00:57:15,646 --> 00:57:20,481
When a man thinks of the past,
he becomes kinder.

422
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:22,875
And most important...

423
00:57:55,726 --> 00:57:56,681
Most important...

424
00:58:01,726 --> 00:58:02,681
You have to believe!

425
00:58:12,366 --> 00:58:13,560
Now you can go.

426
00:58:19,526 --> 00:58:20,675
Who wants to be the first?

427
00:58:26,126 --> 00:58:27,161
Maybe, you?

428
00:58:29,286 --> 00:58:32,005
Me? No, l don't want to.

429
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:37,404
l understand, it's not easy,
but it will pass.

430
00:58:39,286 --> 00:58:40,401
l doubt...

431
00:58:42,126 --> 00:58:43,764
that it will pass.

432
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:48,757
lf l begin recalling my life,

433
00:58:50,446 --> 00:58:52,243
it's very unlikely l'll get any kinder.

434
00:58:54,126 --> 00:58:58,677
Besides, don'tyou feel
how shameful the whole thing is?

435
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:20,676
Humiliating yourself,
sniveling, praying?

436
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:23,956
What's so bad in praying?

437
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:27,922
lt's justyour pride speaking.

438
00:59:29,646 --> 00:59:34,436
Calm down, you're not ready yet.
lt happens quite often.

439
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:38,559
Maybe, you first?

440
00:59:46,806 --> 00:59:47,761
Yes, me.

441
00:59:58,446 --> 01:00:03,315
We see before us
Professor's new invention!

442
01:00:04,286 --> 01:00:08,074
An appliance exploring human souls!
Soulmeter!

443
01:00:08,726 --> 01:00:10,318
lt's only a bomb.

444
01:00:11,446 --> 01:00:12,401
What?

445
01:00:14,526 --> 01:00:15,595
You must be kidding.

446
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:21,156
No, it's just a bomb.
Twenty kilotons.

447
01:00:22,806 --> 01:00:23,841
What for?

448
01:00:34,286 --> 01:00:37,835
We had it assembled with my friends.

449
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,595
With my former colleagues.

450
01:00:47,646 --> 01:00:51,161
This place will never bring any
happiness to anyone.

451
01:00:55,366 --> 01:00:59,598
But if this thing gets into the wrong
hands...

452
01:01:02,206 --> 01:01:04,162
Though, l'm not sure any more.

453
01:01:06,366 --> 01:01:08,004
We came to the conclusion then...

454
01:01:10,726 --> 01:01:13,160
that we shouldn't destroy the Zone
after all.

455
01:01:14,726 --> 01:01:20,244
Even if it's some miracle,
it's still part of nature,

456
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:23,241
and therefore, a hope in a sense.

457
01:01:25,366 --> 01:01:29,484
They had hidden that bomb,
and l've found it.

458
01:01:29,806 --> 01:01:32,161
The old building, bunker four.

459
01:01:37,526 --> 01:01:40,757
l guess there must be a principle...

460
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,755
Never do anything
that can't be undone.

461
01:01:45,206 --> 01:01:47,162
l understand everything, l'm not some
maniac.

462
01:01:51,526 --> 01:01:56,600
But as long as this plague lies
in the open, accessible to any scum,

463
01:01:59,446 --> 01:02:00,765
l can get no peace, no sleep.

464
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:12,002
Or maybe, my innermost
won't let me do it?

465
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:20,245
Poor man, some problem
he's invented for himself.

466
01:02:43,206 --> 01:02:44,161
Give it to me!

467
01:02:58,806 --> 01:02:59,761
Give it to me!

468
01:03:04,966 --> 01:03:06,922
You're a civilized man, aren'tyou?

469
01:03:14,206 --> 01:03:17,243
- Why? What's the matter with you?
- You, lousy hypocrite...

470
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:23,405
Why?
What have l done... to you?

471
01:03:24,446 --> 01:03:28,485
He wants to destroy your hope!

472
01:03:50,646 --> 01:03:53,843
That's all people have got left
on this earth!

473
01:03:54,886 --> 01:03:59,323
lt's the only place
they can come to,

474
01:03:59,726 --> 01:04:01,523
if there's no hope left for them.

475
01:04:04,206 --> 01:04:05,605
You yourself have come here!

476
01:04:06,726 --> 01:04:09,479
Why destroy hope then?

477
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:11,682
Shut up!

478
01:04:14,046 --> 01:04:16,162
l can see through you!

479
01:04:17,526 --> 01:04:19,482
You don't give a damn about people!

480
01:04:20,726 --> 01:04:26,084
You just make money,
using our... anguish!

481
01:04:26,286 --> 01:04:27,719
lt's not even the money.

482
01:04:27,926 --> 01:04:30,884
You're enjoying yourself here.
You're like God Almighty here.

483
01:04:31,526 --> 01:04:35,155
You, a hypocritical louse, decide
who is to live and who is to die.

484
01:04:35,966 --> 01:04:38,002
He deliberates!

485
01:04:39,526 --> 01:04:43,599
Now l see why you stalkers
never enter the room yourselves.

486
01:04:43,886 --> 01:04:48,835
You revel in all that power,
that mystery, your authority!

487
01:04:49,126 --> 01:04:50,639
What else is there to wish for?

488
01:04:51,006 --> 01:04:54,157
lt's not true!
You... you're mistaken.

489
01:04:59,286 --> 01:05:01,163
A stalker must not enter the room.

490
01:05:01,886 --> 01:05:05,674
A stalker must not even enter
the Zone with an ulterior motive.

491
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:08,004
Remember Porcupine?

492
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:12,922
Yes, you're right, l'm a louse.

493
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:16,084
l haven't done any good in this world,
and l can't do any.

494
01:05:18,526 --> 01:05:20,562
l couldn't give anything
even to my wife.

495
01:05:21,886 --> 01:05:26,323
l can't have any friends either.
But don't take mine from me!

496
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:29,996
They'd already taken everything from
me back there, behind the barbed wire.

497
01:05:34,046 --> 01:05:38,756
So all that's mine is here.
You understand? Here! ln the Zone!

498
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:44,924
My happiness, my freedom,
my self-respect, it's all here!

499
01:05:47,286 --> 01:05:50,244
l bring here people like me,
desperate and tormented.

500
01:05:50,726 --> 01:05:54,401
People who have nothing else
to hope for.

501
01:05:55,726 --> 01:05:57,682
And l can help them!

502
01:05:58,046 --> 01:06:01,402
No one else can help them,
only l, the louse, can!

503
01:06:04,046 --> 01:06:06,560
l'm so happy to be able to help them
that l want to cry.

504
01:06:07,886 --> 01:06:09,922
And that's all.
l don't want anything more.

505
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:33,478
l don't know. Maybe.

506
01:06:34,526 --> 01:06:36,596
Anyway, excuse me, but...

507
01:06:38,046 --> 01:06:39,479
You're just a God's fool.

508
01:06:42,046 --> 01:06:44,765
You have no idea
what's going on here.

509
01:06:48,726 --> 01:06:51,559
Why do you think Porcupine
hanged himself?

510
01:06:52,126 --> 01:06:55,163
He came to the Zone
with a mercenary motive.

511
01:06:55,366 --> 01:06:58,324
He made his brother die
in the meat mincer because of money.

512
01:06:58,526 --> 01:07:01,484
l know.
But why did he hang himself?

513
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:06,075
Why didn't he come here again,
not for money, but for his brother?

514
01:07:06,886 --> 01:07:08,842
ln way of repenting.

515
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:13,564
He wanted to... l don't know.
He hanged himself a week later.

516
01:07:13,806 --> 01:07:16,400
Because he realized that
not just any wish comes true here,

517
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:19,605
but only your innermost wish.

518
01:07:27,646 --> 01:07:29,841
Not what would you holler
at the top of your voice...

519
01:07:37,886 --> 01:07:40,923
Coming true here is
only what's in line with your nature,

520
01:07:41,126 --> 01:07:43,845
with your essence,
of which you know nothing.

521
01:07:44,046 --> 01:07:47,243
But it's there, in you,
directing you all your life.

522
01:07:48,806 --> 01:07:51,001
You didn't understand anything,
Leather Stocking.

523
01:07:51,286 --> 01:07:53,242
lt wasn't greed that had done
Porcupine in.

524
01:07:53,446 --> 01:07:56,483
He was crawling in this puddle,
begging to bring his brother back.

525
01:07:57,046 --> 01:08:01,756
But what he got was only money,
and he couldn't get anything else,

526
01:08:02,726 --> 01:08:05,240
because render unto Porcupine
the things that are Porcupine's!

527
01:08:06,206 --> 01:08:10,245
And things like conscience, anguish,
they are just inventions.

528
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:13,002
He realized that and hanged himself.

529
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,603
l'm not going to your room.

530
01:08:21,446 --> 01:08:25,678
l have no wish to pour my filth
over somebody's head.

531
01:08:26,526 --> 01:08:27,754
Even yours.

532
01:08:28,806 --> 01:08:30,922
And then to put my neck into
the noose, like Porcupine.

533
01:08:32,366 --> 01:08:36,996
l'd rather drink myself to death
in my mansion, in peace and quiet.

534
01:08:39,526 --> 01:08:44,395
You don't understand anything
about human beings, Chingachgook,

535
01:08:45,126 --> 01:08:47,401
if you take to the Zone
people like me.

536
01:08:55,206 --> 01:08:56,400
And something else...

537
01:08:58,286 --> 01:09:02,074
Why do you think that this miracle
really exists?

538
01:09:03,726 --> 01:09:08,163
Who told you that wishes
actually come true here?

539
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:14,838
Have you seen a single man
who's been made happy here?

540
01:09:16,126 --> 01:09:17,605
Was it Porcupine?

541
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:27,077
As a matter of fact,
who told you about the Zone,

542
01:09:27,286 --> 01:09:30,323
about Porcupine, about that room?

543
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:32,763
He did.

544
01:10:35,646 --> 01:10:37,762
Then it makes no sense to me at all.

545
01:10:39,366 --> 01:10:41,402
What's the use coming here?

546
01:12:01,806 --> 01:12:02,841
lt's so quiet...

547
01:12:04,806 --> 01:12:05,761
Can you feel it?

548
01:12:11,366 --> 01:12:14,403
What the heck... Why not chuck it all,

549
01:12:16,046 --> 01:12:20,244
take my wife, Monkey,
and move over here.

550
01:12:23,966 --> 01:12:24,921
For good.

551
01:12:27,646 --> 01:12:31,844
There's no one here.
No one can hurt them here.

552
01:16:36,806 --> 01:16:38,000
So you're back.

553
01:16:44,126 --> 01:16:45,923
Where did you get this?

554
01:16:47,486 --> 01:16:50,922
He got attached to me.
l couldn't leave him there.

555
01:17:08,286 --> 01:17:12,916
Well, shall we go?
Monkey is waiting.

556
01:17:17,206 --> 01:17:18,161
Are you coming?

557
01:17:32,286 --> 01:17:34,402
Does any one of you need a dog?

558
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:39,675
l've got five of them at home.

559
01:17:49,446 --> 01:17:51,960
So you love dogs, don'tyou?

560
01:17:52,606 --> 01:17:53,595
What?

561
01:17:54,046 --> 01:17:55,320
That's very good.

562
01:18:00,966 --> 01:18:03,161
All right, let's go.

563
01:20:58,446 --> 01:21:00,402
You can't even imagine
howtired l am!

564
01:21:02,366 --> 01:21:04,004
God only knows!

565
01:21:06,046 --> 01:21:10,244
Calling themselves intellectuals,
those writers and scientists!

566
01:21:10,446 --> 01:21:11,401
Don't get so excited.

567
01:21:12,526 --> 01:21:14,164
They don't believe in anything!

568
01:21:15,126 --> 01:21:21,759
They've got the organ with which one
believes atrophied for lack of use.

569
01:21:23,646 --> 01:21:26,843
Stop it. Come on.
Go to bed. Don't lie here...

570
01:21:27,526 --> 01:21:31,599
lt's too damp here for you...
You shouldn't lie here.

571
01:21:35,366 --> 01:21:36,082
Take it off.

572
01:22:45,366 --> 01:22:47,004
Oh God, what people...

573
01:22:47,406 --> 01:22:50,603
Calm down, it's not their fault.

574
01:22:51,526 --> 01:22:53,676
You ought to pity them,
not to be angry with them.

575
01:22:54,286 --> 01:22:56,595
Haven'tyou seen them? They've
got empty eyes.

576
01:23:08,886 --> 01:23:11,605
The only thing
they can think about

577
01:23:12,126 --> 01:23:14,765
is howto sell themselves
not too cheap!

578
01:23:15,046 --> 01:23:17,560
Howto get as much as possible
for their every emotional movement!

579
01:23:20,726 --> 01:23:24,924
They knowthey were ''born for
a purpose'', ''called upon''!

580
01:23:27,726 --> 01:23:29,318
After all, they live ''only once''!

581
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:34,325
Can people like that
believe in anything?

582
01:23:35,726 --> 01:23:38,160
Stop it, calm down.

583
01:23:39,526 --> 01:23:42,996
Try to sleep, will you?
Go to sleep.

584
01:23:46,966 --> 01:23:52,404
And nobody believes.
Not only those two. Nobody!

585
01:23:53,526 --> 01:23:55,084
Who am l going to take there?

586
01:23:59,286 --> 01:24:00,321
Oh, God...

587
01:24:01,606 --> 01:24:02,834
And what's most awful...

588
01:24:05,526 --> 01:24:07,403
is that no one needs it.

589
01:24:07,606 --> 01:24:11,485
No one needs that room.
And all my efforts are just in vain.

590
01:24:12,486 --> 01:24:15,523
Why do you say that?
Stop it.

591
01:24:21,926 --> 01:24:23,917
l'm not going there with anybody
again.

592
01:24:26,006 --> 01:24:30,397
Do you want me to go with you?

593
01:24:31,886 --> 01:24:32,841
Where?

594
01:24:33,606 --> 01:24:35,995
You think l've got nothing
to ask for?

595
01:24:40,646 --> 01:24:41,476
No...

596
01:24:45,606 --> 01:24:46,834
You can't go there.

597
01:24:47,206 --> 01:24:48,161
Why not?

598
01:24:51,046 --> 01:24:52,001
No, no.

599
01:24:57,126 --> 01:25:00,675
What if it wouldn't work
with you, either?

600
01:25:35,446 --> 01:25:38,404
You know, my mother was against it.

601
01:25:40,526 --> 01:25:44,678
You've probably noticed already
that he's not of this world.

602
01:25:47,806 --> 01:25:49,762
All our neighborhood laughed at him.

603
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:52,680
He was such a bungler,
he looked so pitiful.

604
01:25:55,206 --> 01:25:58,596
My mother used to say:
''He's a stalker,

605
01:25:58,806 --> 01:26:01,115
he's doomed,
he's an eternal prisoner!

606
01:26:01,326 --> 01:26:04,602
Don'tyou know what kind of
children the stalkers have?''

607
01:26:04,806 --> 01:26:07,400
And l... l didn't even argue with her.

608
01:26:10,286 --> 01:26:13,756
l knew it all myself,
that he was doomed,

609
01:26:13,966 --> 01:26:18,005
that he was an eternal prisoner,
and about the children.

610
01:26:21,726 --> 01:26:23,318
Only what could l do?

611
01:26:23,526 --> 01:26:26,484
l was sure
l would be happy with him.

612
01:26:28,886 --> 01:26:31,002
Of course, l knew l'd have a lot of
sorrow, too.

613
01:26:32,526 --> 01:26:37,077
But it's better to have
a bitter happiness than...

614
01:26:38,806 --> 01:26:40,478
a gray, dull life.

615
01:26:45,446 --> 01:26:48,677
Perhaps,
l thought it all up later.

616
01:26:57,966 --> 01:27:01,925
But then he approached me and said:
''Come with me.''

617
01:27:02,126 --> 01:27:06,677
And l did,
and never regretted it.

618
01:27:10,526 --> 01:27:11,595
Never.

619
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:17,086
We had a lot of sorrow,

620
01:27:17,446 --> 01:27:19,482
a lot of fear, and a lot of shame.

621
01:27:19,726 --> 01:27:23,162
But l never regretted it,
and l never envied anyone.

622
01:27:25,446 --> 01:27:30,566
lt's just our fate, our life,
that's how we are.

623
01:27:36,286 --> 01:27:39,835
And if we haven't had our misfortunes,
we wouldn't have been better off.

624
01:27:41,446 --> 01:27:42,765
lt would have been worse.

625
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:50,236
Because in that case, there wouldn't
have been any happiness.

626
01:27:52,646 --> 01:27:54,398
And there wouldn't have been
any hope.

627
01:28:43,886 --> 01:28:46,844
l love your eyes, my darling friend,

628
01:28:47,526 --> 01:28:50,598
Their play, so passionate and
bright'ning,

629
01:28:51,966 --> 01:28:54,844
When a sudden stare up you send,

630
01:28:55,726 --> 01:28:58,320
And like a heaven-blown lightning,

631
01:28:58,886 --> 01:29:02,037
lt'd take in all from end to end.

632
01:29:02,886 --> 01:29:05,844
But there's more that l admire:

633
01:29:06,446 --> 01:29:09,244
Your eyes when they're downcast

634
01:29:09,726 --> 01:29:12,923
ln bursts of love-inspired fire,

635
01:29:13,286 --> 01:29:16,403
And through the eyelash goes fast

636
01:29:17,286 --> 01:29:23,600
A somber, dull call of desire...

637
01:32:04,726 --> 01:32:11,484
The End
