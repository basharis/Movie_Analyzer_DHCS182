1
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:45,022
<i>Remember, remember</i>
<i>The 5th of November</i>

2
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:47,887
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

3
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,325
<i>I know of no reason</i>
<i>Why the gunpowder treason</i>

4
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:52,431
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

5
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:57,396
<i>But what of the man?</i>

6
00:00:58,938 --> 00:01:01,099
<i>I know his name was Guy Fawkes...</i>

7
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:06,007
<i>... and I know in 1605, he attempted</i>
<i>to blow up the Houses of Parliament.</i>

8
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:08,409
<i>But who was he really?</i>

9
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:10,014
<i>What was he like?</i>

10
00:01:16,823 --> 00:01:20,315
<i>We are told to remember the idea</i>
<i>and not the man.</i>

11
00:01:20,493 --> 00:01:22,051
<i>Because a man can fail.</i>

12
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:27,223
<i>He can be caught,</i>
<i>he can be killed and forgotten.</i>

13
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,459
<i>But 400 years later...</i>

14
00:01:29,636 --> 00:01:32,366
<i>... an idea can still change the world.</i>

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,367
<i>I have witnessed firsthand</i>
<i>the power of ideas.</i>

16
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:39,970
<i>I've seen people kill</i>
<i>in the name of them...</i>

17
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,508
<i>... and die defending them.</i>

18
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:47,749
<i>But you cannot kiss an idea...</i>

19
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:51,157
<i>... cannot touch it or hold it.</i>

20
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:55,922
<i>Ideas do not bleed.</i>
<i>They do not feel pain.</i>

21
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:58,196
<i>They do not love.</i>

22
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,562
<i>And it is not an idea that I miss.</i>

23
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:05,704
<i>It is a man.</i>

24
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:09,399
<i>A man that made me remember</i>
<i>the 5th of November.</i>

25
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:11,669
<i>A man that I will never forget.</i>

26
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:30,095
<i>So I read that the former United States</i>
<i>is so desperate for medical supplies...</i>

27
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:35,291
<i>... that they have allegedly sent several</i>
<i>containers filled with wheat and tobacco.</i>

28
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:38,904
<i>A gesture, they said, of goodwill.</i>

29
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:40,933
<i>You wanna know what I think?</i>

30
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:44,739
<i>Well, you're listening to my show,</i>
<i>so I will assume you do.</i>

31
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:48,278
<i>It's high time we let the colonies know</i>
<i>what we really think of them.</i>

32
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,714
<i>I think it's payback time for a little tea party</i>
<i>they threw for us a few hundred years ago.</i>

33
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:56,083
<i>I say we go down to those docks tonight</i>
<i>and dump that crap...</i>

34
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:59,555
<i>... where everything from</i>
<i>the Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica belongs!</i>

35
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:02,126
<i>Who's with me? Who's bloody with me?!</i>

36
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:04,896
<i>Did you like that?</i>

37
00:03:05,064 --> 00:03:09,228
<i>U.S.A., Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica.</i>
<i>I mean, what else can you say?</i>

38
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:12,963
<i>Here was a country that had everything,</i>
<i>absolutely everything...</i>

39
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:15,471
<i>... and now, 20 years later, is what?</i>

40
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:19,305
<i>The world's biggest leper colony. Why?</i>

41
00:03:20,246 --> 00:03:21,577
<i>Godlessness.</i>

42
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:23,340
<i>Let me say that again.</i>

43
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:24,813
<i>Godlessness.</i>

44
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:28,519
<i>It wasn't the war they started.</i>
<i>It wasn't the plague they created.</i>

45
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:30,946
<i>It was Judgment.</i>

46
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:35,254
<i>No one escapes their past.</i>
<i>No one escapes Judgment.</i>

47
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:38,661
<i>You think he's not up there?</i>

48
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:41,322
<i>You think he's not watching over</i>
<i>this country?</i>

49
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:45,699
<i>How else can you explain it?</i>
<i>He tested us, but we came through.</i>

50
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:47,305
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,542
<i>Islington. Enfield.</i>
<i>I was there. I saw it all.</i>

52
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,111
<i>Immigrants, Muslims...</i>

53
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:57,007
<i>... homosexuals, terrorists.</i>

54
00:03:57,183 --> 00:04:01,119
<i>Disease-ridden degenerates.</i>
<i>They had to go.</i>

55
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:04,450
<i>Strength through unity.</i>
<i>Unity through faith.</i>

56
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:08,583
<i>I am a God-fearing Englishman,</i>
<i>and I'm goddamn proud of it!</i>

57
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:11,127
That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.

58
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:14,526
Oh, shit.

59
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:20,431
<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

60
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,906
<i>Any unauthorized personnel</i>
<i>will be subject to arrest.</i>

61
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:26,602
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

62
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:30,044
<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

63
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:33,674
<i>Any unauthorized personnel</i>
<i>will be subject to arrest.</i>

64
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,286
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

65
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,387
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, I didn't see you...

66
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,220
- In a hurry, are we?
- I was just...

67
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:44,090
- It's past curfew, you know.
- My uncle, he's very sick.

68
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:47,858
- Sick uncle? What you think on that, Willy?
- It's a load of bollocks.

69
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:50,935
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.

70
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:54,471
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.

71
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:56,768
See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?

72
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:59,776
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.

73
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:03,643
- Don't touch me!
- Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.

74
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:06,580
- She just threatened us.
- That she did, that she did.

75
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:08,345
You know what that means,
don't you?

76
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:11,251
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.

77
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:13,285
And you get to swallow it.

78
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,586
- You're Fingermen.
- She's getting the picture.

79
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,491
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

80
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,655
Not yet you're not. But you will be.

81
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:23,359
By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...

82
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,929
...then you'll certainly be the sorest.

83
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:31,644
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.

84
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:34,336
I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!

85
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:37,745
- What do you think, lads?
- Spare the rod, spoil the child.

86
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,509
Help me! Someone help!

87
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:43,019
The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him.

88
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,223
- What the hell?!
- Bugger off!

89
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:48,451
Disdaining fortune,
with his brandish'd steel...

90
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:50,493
...which smoked with bloody execution.

91
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:52,153
We're Fingermen, pal.

92
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,058
Jesus Christ! Mercy!

93
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:31,396
We are oft to blame in this...
'Tis too much proved.

94
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:35,405
- That with devotion's visage and pious action
we do sugar o'er the devil himself.

95
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:38,237
- What's that mean?
- Spare the rod.

96
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:45,912
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

97
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:47,746
- Who are you?
- Who?

98
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,354
Who is but the form
following the function of what...

99
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:52,354
...and what I am is a man in a mask.

100
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,584
- Oh, I can see that.
- Of course you can.

101
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,888
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.

102
00:06:57,063 --> 00:07:01,159
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

103
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:05,966
- Right.
- But on this most auspicious of nights...

104
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,438
...permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet...

105
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:12,737
...to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona.

106
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:15,504
Voilà!

107
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:17,672
In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran...

108
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,014
...cast vicariously as both victim and villain
by the vicissitudes of fate.

109
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:24,884
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity...

110
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:28,549
...is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.

111
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:33,097
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified...

112
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:36,997
...and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice...

113
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,970
...and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.

114
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:50,241
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta...

115
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:54,113
...held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such...

116
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:57,586
...shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.

117
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,091
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.

118
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:07,198
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you...

119
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,061
...and you may call me V.

120
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,328
Are you, like, a crazy person?

121
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,531
I am quite sure they will say so.

122
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,676
But to whom, might I ask, am I speaking?

123
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:21,707
- I'm Evey.
- Evey?

124
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,247
E-vey. Of course you are.

125
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:27,116
- What does that mean?
- It means that I, like God...

126
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:30,517
...do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.

127
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,521
Are you hurt?

128
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:34,353
No, I'm fine.

129
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:38,221
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, I merely played my part.

130
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:42,094
- But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
- I suppose.

131
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,293
You see, I'm a musician of sorts...

132
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,870
...and on my way to give
a very special performance.

133
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,597
What kind of musician?

134
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,639
Percussion instruments
are my speciality.

135
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,143
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event...

136
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:56,338
...and would be honored
if you could join me.

137
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,642
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.

138
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:01,378
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.

139
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:04,318
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.

140
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:07,784
All right.

141
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:11,160
It's beautiful up here.

142
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:15,725
A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.

143
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:17,392
I don't see any instruments.

144
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,471
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.

145
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:25,871
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto...

146
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:29,344
...in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts...

147
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:33,542
...and in recognition of the imposter
that stands in her stead.

148
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,945
Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?

149
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,488
- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.

150
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:50,927
<i>Remember, remember</i>
<i>The 5th of November</i>

151
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,163
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

152
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,309
<i>I know of no reason</i>
<i>Why the gunpowder treason</i>

153
00:09:57,476 --> 00:10:00,001
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

154
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:06,716
First, the overture.

155
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:09,780
Yes.

156
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,217
Yes, the strings.

157
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:15,855
Listen carefully, can you hear it?

158
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:19,122
Now the brass.

159
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:21,027
I can hear it!

160
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:30,101
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!

161
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,941
- How do you do that?
- Wait.

162
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:39,050
Here comes the crescendo!

163
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,124
How beautiful, is it not?

164
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:04,972
<i>Gentlemen, you have had four hours.</i>
<i>You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.</i>

165
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:08,074
The Bailey area is quarantined.

166
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:10,477
All significant witnesses
have been detained.

167
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:11,877
<i>Good. Mr. Etheridge?</i>

168
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:16,078
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

169
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:19,019
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
<i>1812 Overture</i>.

170
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:21,625
<i>Add it to the blacklist.</i>
<i>I never want to hear that again.</i>

171
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:23,022
Yes, sir.

172
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:26,926
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance...

173
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:30,660
...indicating a high percentage of
conversation concerned with the explosion.

174
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:32,804
<i>Mr. Dascomb,</i>
<i>what are we doing about that?</i>

175
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:35,372
We're calling it an emergency demolition.

176
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,567
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.

177
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:42,942
Several experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.

178
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:46,084
<i>I want Prothero to speak on</i>
<i>the dangers of these old buildings...</i>

179
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:49,710
<i>... and how we must avoid clinging</i>
<i>to the edifice of a decadent past.</i>

180
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:53,552
<i>He should conclude that the New Bailey</i>
<i>will become the symbol of our time...</i>

181
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:56,854
<i>... and the future</i>
<i>that our conviction has rewarded us.</i>

182
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,257
<i>Mr. Heyer.</i>

183
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:01,628
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist...

184
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:05,168
...though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

185
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:10,502
We also managed to get a picture of the girl
that Creedy's men were detaining.

186
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:12,974
<i>- Who is she, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Not sure yet, sir.

187
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:15,670
- But we're working on several leads.
<i>- Anything else?</i>

188
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:17,644
We located the fireworks launch...

189
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,684
...and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

190
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:26,120
Unfortunately it appears that
despite the heavy level of sophistication...

191
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:29,989
...these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals...

192
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:32,653
...making them very difficult to trace.

193
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,663
Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.

194
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:40,202
<i>Spare us your professional annotations,</i>
<i>Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.</i>

195
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:42,101
Apologies, chancellor.

196
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:43,901
<i>Gentlemen, this is a test.</i>

197
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:46,704
<i>Moments such as these</i>
<i>are matters of faith.</i>

198
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,076
<i>To fail is to invite doubt</i>
<i>into everything we believe...</i>

199
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:51,944
<i>... everything we have fought for.</i>

200
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:57,055
<i>Doubt will plunge this country back</i>
<i>into chaos, and I will not let that happen.</i>

201
00:12:57,223 --> 00:12:59,748
<i>Gentlemen, I want this terrorist found...</i>

202
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:04,259
<i>... and I want him to understand</i>
<i>what terror really means.</i>

203
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:05,896
<i>England prevails.</i>

204
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:08,629
England prevails.

205
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:18,139
- You think people will buy this?
- Why not?

206
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,210
This is the BTN.

207
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:23,109
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.

208
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:25,783
That's the government's job.

209
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,049
On the lighter side of things...

210
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:32,713
...seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the Old Bailey...

211
00:13:32,892 --> 00:13:35,952
...wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.

212
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:40,023
<i>Although the demolition had been</i>
<i>planned for some time...</i>

213
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:43,259
<i>... the music and the fireworks were,</i>
<i>according to the crew chief...</i>

214
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:46,302
<i>..."definitely not on the schedule."</i>
<i>- We'll be right back.</i>

215
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:50,306
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.

216
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:51,943
I saw it, the whole thing.

217
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:54,811
- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was...

218
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,279
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?

219
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:00,951
Evey, there you are.

220
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,281
- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.

221
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:05,821
I need two espressos and three coffees.

222
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:07,982
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.

223
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:11,457
I don't get it.

224
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,691
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?

225
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:19,827
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.

226
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:22,263
Maybe he's just getting started.

227
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:25,509
Yeah?

228
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:28,002
Okay. A lead on the girl.

229
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:31,115
Look, don't get me wrong, I love it.
A cow getting crucified.

230
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:34,452
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.

231
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,316
You've got to rewrite it, okay?
Gotta go.

232
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:41,053
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.

233
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,990
- Mr. Deitrich...
- Gordon, please.

234
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:45,722
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.

235
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:47,525
Gordon...

236
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,635
...I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen...

237
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:52,395
...and I got scared and went home.

238
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:57,065
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.

239
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,888
Gotcha.

240
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:21,223
- Hey, Fred.
- All that been x-rayed?

241
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,265
Nope. They're filled with bombs.

242
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:25,699
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?

243
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,199
- I can't believe you watch that shit.
- What?

244
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,309
Laser Lass is banging.

245
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:46,181
What's all that?

246
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:49,452
Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.

247
00:15:49,628 --> 00:15:51,289
Must be Prothero.

248
00:15:51,463 --> 00:15:55,797
I wish someone had the balls to tell
that brat this station ain't his playground.

249
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,428
What the hell is this?

250
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:05,271
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.

251
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:09,746
This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.

252
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:13,078
- They were detained when she was 12.
- What happened to her?

253
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,584
Juvenile Reclamation Project...

254
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:16,914
...for five years.
- Shit.

255
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,455
We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.

256
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,956
You sure about that, sir?

257
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:25,290
I want a chance to talk to her before she
disappears into one of Creedy's black bags.

258
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:38,671
Who's that?

259
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:42,678
Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.

260
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:50,015
Fucking hell.

261
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,553
Come on, let's move!

262
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:17,113
You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.

263
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:18,943
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

264
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:24,912
<i>Will all personnel please</i>
<i>evacuate the building.</i>

265
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:26,851
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

266
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:30,051
<i>Will all personnel evacuate the building.</i>

267
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,329
What the hell's going on?

268
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:39,528
- It's jammed.
- Break it down.

269
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:46,710
Dominic!

270
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,146
Police! Out of the way!

271
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:52,374
Get out the way!

272
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:01,389
Damn it!

273
00:18:04,863 --> 00:18:07,331
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>

274
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:10,161
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>England prevails.</i>

275
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:14,902
- Clear the halls.
- Sir.

276
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:18,106
<i>Help, Storm, help!</i>

277
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:30,715
Don't touch it.

278
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:33,016
Dad, what's wrong with the telly?

279
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:50,735
<i>Good evening, London.</i>

280
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,202
<i>- Allow me first to apologize...</i>
- That's the emergency channel!

281
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:58,509
<i>I do, like many of you, appreciate</i>
<i>the comforts of the everyday routine...</i>

282
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:02,677
<i>... the security of the familiar,</i>
<i>the tranquility of repetition.</i>

283
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:03,947
Bloody hell.

284
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:07,614
<i>I enjoy them as much as any bloke.</i>
<i>But in the spirit of commemoration...</i>

285
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:08,851
Who's that, Mum?

286
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:10,927
<i>- Whereby important events of the past...</i>

287
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:15,123
<i>... usually associated with someone's death</i>
<i>or the end of some awful, bloody struggle...</i>

288
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,894
<i>... are celebrated with a nice holiday...</i>

289
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:20,594
<i>... I thought we could mark</i>
<i>this November the 5th...</i>

290
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:23,070
<i>... a day that is, sadly,</i>
<i>no longer remembered...</i>

291
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:27,843
<i>... by taking some time out of our daily lives</i>
<i>to sit down and have a little chat.</i>

292
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:31,005
<i>There are, of course,</i>
<i>those who do not want us to speak.</i>

293
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:32,445
Let me think, let me think.

294
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:35,109
<i>Even now, orders are being shouted</i>
<i>into telephones...</i>

295
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:37,482
<i>... and men with guns</i>
<i>will soon be on their way.</i>

296
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:39,487
- It's Chancellor Sutler.
- Damn it!

297
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:44,027
<i>Why? Because while the truncheon</i>
<i>may be used in lieu of conversation...</i>

298
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:46,994
<i>... words will always retain their power.</i>

299
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,633
<i>Words offer the means to meaning...</i>

300
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:52,998
<i>... and, for those who will listen,</i>
<i>the enunciation of truth.</i>

301
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:54,570
<i>And the truth is...</i>

302
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,141
<i>... there is something terribly wrong</i>
<i>with this country, isn't there?</i>

303
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,711
You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!

304
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,475
<i>Cruelty and injustice,</i>
<i>intolerance and oppression.</i>

305
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:07,983
<i>And where once</i>
<i>you had the freedom to object...</i>

306
00:20:08,153 --> 00:20:09,950
<i>... to think and speak as you saw fit...</i>

307
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:13,353
<i>... you now have censors and surveillance</i>
<i>coercing your conformity...</i>

308
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,358
...<i>and soliciting submission</i>.
- Cameras. We need cameras.

309
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:19,190
<i>How did this happen? Who's to blame?</i>

310
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:22,632
<i>Certainly there are those</i>
<i>who are more responsible than others.</i>

311
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:24,701
<i>And they will be held accountable.</i>

312
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,839
<i>But again, truth be told,</i>
<i>if you're looking for the guilty...</i>

313
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,740
<i>... you need only look into a mirror.</i>

314
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:33,037
<i>I know why you did it.</i>

315
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:34,906
<i>I know you were afraid.</i>

316
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,607
<i>Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.</i>

317
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:41,480
<i>There were a myriad of problems</i>
<i>which conspired...</i>

318
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:45,020
<i>... to corrupt your reason</i>
<i>and rob you of your common sense.</i>

319
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,782
<i>Fear got the best of you.</i>

320
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:51,191
<i>And in your panic, you turned to</i>
<i>the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.</i>

321
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:53,888
<i>He promised you order,</i>
<i>he promised you peace...</i>

322
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:57,830
<i>... and all he demanded in return</i>
<i>was your silent, obedient consent.</i>

323
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:01,769
- Inspector, they're almost through.
<i>- Last night, I sought to end that silence.</i>

324
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,238
<i>Last night,</i>
<i>I destroyed the Old Bailey...</i>

325
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:07,776
<i>... to remind this country</i>
<i>of what it has forgotten.</i>

326
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,279
<i>More than 400 years ago, a great citizen</i>
<i>wished to imbed the 5th of November...</i>

327
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:14,919
<i>... forever in our memory.</i>

328
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:18,750
<i>His hope was to remind the world</i>
<i>that fairness, justice and freedom...</i>

329
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:20,915
<i>... are more than words.</i>

330
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:22,685
<i>They are perspectives.</i>

331
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:24,726
<i>So if you've seen nothing...</i>

332
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:28,662
<i>... if the crimes of this government</i>
<i>remain unknown to you...</i>

333
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:33,100
<i>... then I would suggest that you allow</i>
<i>the 5th of November to pass unmarked.</i>

334
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:36,399
<i>But if you see what I see...</i>

335
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:41,137
<i>... if you feel as I feel,</i>
<i>and if you would seek as I seek...</i>

336
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:44,214
<i>... then I ask you to stand beside me,</i>
<i>one year from tonight...</i>

337
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:46,544
<i>... outside the gates of Parliament.</i>

338
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:49,448
<i>And together, we shall give them</i>
<i>a 5th of November...</i>

339
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:52,818
<i>... that shall never, ever be forgot.</i>

340
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:01,123
Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.

341
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:02,823
Cover the exits.

342
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:05,765
No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.

343
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:10,402
Left.

344
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:11,974
You go right.

345
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:13,771
Spread out.

346
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:23,487
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

347
00:22:25,757 --> 00:22:27,349
Hold your fire!

348
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:35,489
He put masks on all of us.

349
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:36,929
Jesus.

350
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:38,592
- Don't shoot!
- Wait!

351
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:40,328
- Wait!
- Hold your fire!

352
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:42,666
Freeze! Nobody move!

353
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:45,104
If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!

354
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:52,449
- Get their masks off.
- Please hurry!

355
00:22:54,352 --> 00:22:56,149
There's a bomb in the control booth.

356
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,948
Oh, no.

357
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:02,289
- Jones, get anyone not wearing a mask out.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:04,827
- Marshal, help carry this man.
- Sir.

359
00:23:04,996 --> 00:23:06,554
Everyone else, let's go.

360
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:16,498
Good God.

361
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:19,075
Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!

362
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,883
Dascomb.

363
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:33,923
Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?

364
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:36,151
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

365
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:37,488
Wait, wait!

366
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:41,165
Don't shoot me, please! It's him! It's him!

367
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:44,827
On your knees! On your knees!

368
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:47,399
Please! Please don't hurt me!

369
00:24:14,432 --> 00:24:16,093
Here we go.

370
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:23,135
I did it.

371
00:24:23,508 --> 00:24:24,736
I did it.

372
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:30,912
Freeze!

373
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:33,880
Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.

374
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,319
I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of London's finest.

375
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:44,560
I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.

376
00:24:44,729 --> 00:24:47,323
We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.

377
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:48,796
I don't know about that.

378
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:07,615
<i>We're interrupting your regularly scheduled</i>
<i>program to bring you this terrifying report...</i>

379
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:11,415
<i>... of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower</i>
<i>which ended only moments ago.</i>

380
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,821
<i>A psychotic terrorist,</i>
<i>identified only as the letter V...</i>

381
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:18,952
<i>... attacked the control booth with</i>
<i>high-powered explosives and weapons...</i>

382
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,260
<i>... that he used against unarmed civilians</i>
<i>in order to broadcast a message of hate.</i>

383
00:25:23,768 --> 00:25:28,034
<i>We've just received this footage</i>
<i>of a daring police raid.</i>

384
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:33,843
<i>Stop! Stop, stay where you are,</i>
<i>or we'll shoot! Stay where you are!</i>

385
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,349
<i>Now, this is only an initial report...</i>

386
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,513
<i>... but at this time, it's believed</i>
<i>that during this heroic raid...</i>

387
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:44,518
<i>... the terrorist was shot and killed.</i>

388
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:45,917
Bollocks.

389
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:49,549
<i>Again, from what we've been told</i>
<i>by authorities, the danger is now over.</i>

390
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:51,355
<i>The terrorist is dead.</i>

391
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:58,234
Right there. What's he thinking?

392
00:25:58,703 --> 00:26:00,864
Is he considering leaving her?

393
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,472
After she just saved him?

394
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,706
He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.

395
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:11,940
Some part of him's human.

396
00:26:12,717 --> 00:26:16,050
And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.

397
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:45,636
- You scared me.
- My apologies.

398
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:48,736
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, thank you.

399
00:27:48,913 --> 00:27:51,347
- What is this place?
- It's my home.

400
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:54,974
- I call it the Shadow Gallery.
- It's beautiful.

401
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:58,088
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Oh, here and there.

402
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:01,851
Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.

403
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:03,961
- You stole them?
- Heavens, no.

404
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:05,994
Stealing implies ownership.

405
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:09,327
You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.

406
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:11,264
God, if they ever find this place...

407
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:15,395
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.

408
00:28:15,573 --> 00:28:17,837
You mean, after what you've done.

409
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:20,671
God, what have I done?

410
00:28:20,845 --> 00:28:22,972
I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?

411
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:26,709
- You did what you thought was right.
- No, I shouldn't have done that.

412
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:28,819
I must have been out of my mind.

413
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:32,218
Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?

414
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:34,214
I think I should go.

415
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:36,451
- May I ask where?
- Home. I have to go home.

416
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:40,564
They're looking for you. If they know
where you work, they know where you live.

417
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:45,567
- I have friends, I could stay with them.
- I'm afraid that won't work either.

418
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:48,865
You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us...

419
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,701
...but I couldn't see any other way.

420
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,139
You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.

421
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:57,509
If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.

422
00:28:57,682 --> 00:29:01,584
They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you...

423
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:03,721
...in the pursuit of finding me.

424
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:06,288
After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen...

425
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:10,451
...so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:

426
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:12,220
Here, to my home.

427
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:16,164
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.

428
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:18,768
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.

429
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:20,928
But I don't even know where this is.

430
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:24,098
You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.

431
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:28,302
- That'd be enough for a clever man.
- Are you saying that I have to stay here?

432
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,847
Only until I'm done.
After the 5th, I no longer think it'll matter.

433
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:33,984
You mean a year from now?

434
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:35,949
I have to stay here for a year?

435
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:39,090
Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.

436
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:40,918
You should've left me alone.

437
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:43,458
Why didn't you just leave me alone?!

438
00:29:46,297 --> 00:29:49,460
- Anything else on the parents?
- Yeah, it ain't good.

439
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:51,659
They were interned at Belmarsh.

440
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:53,531
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

441
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:57,106
She died in a hunger strike.
He died when the military retook the shed.

442
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:00,569
And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.

443
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:03,908
- Christ.
- It's nothing but bad luck here.

444
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:07,785
So we know her story. Now we need his.

445
00:30:29,574 --> 00:30:30,802
V?

446
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:37,036
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.

447
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:41,879
I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.

448
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:44,421
Your hands.

449
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:47,389
Yes.

450
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:53,359
There, that's better.

451
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:55,590
I hope I didn't put you off your appetite.

452
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:59,533
- No, please. It's just... Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.

453
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:01,137
Can I ask what happened?

454
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,200
There was a fire. A long time ago.

455
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:07,503
Ancient history, for some.

456
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,544
Not really very good table conversation.

457
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:12,376
Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?

458
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:16,150
- Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
- Have a seat.

459
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:26,858
- It's delicious.
- Good.

460
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:30,125
God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.

461
00:31:30,301 --> 00:31:31,529
Where did you get it?

462
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:34,900
A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.

463
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:38,774
- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.

464
00:31:38,943 --> 00:31:40,171
You're insane.

465
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:44,213
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.

466
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:46,816
<i>- Macbeth.</i>
- Very good.

467
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:49,920
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me...

468
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:52,352
...and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.

469
00:31:52,523 --> 00:31:54,923
Be in plays, movies.

470
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:58,654
When I was 9, I played Viola
in <i>Twelfth Night</i>. Mum was very proud.

471
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,889
Where is your mother now?

472
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:02,862
She's dead.

473
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:04,262
I'm sorry.

474
00:32:06,604 --> 00:32:09,072
- Can I ask about what you said on the telly?
- Yes.

475
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,832
- Did you mean it?
- Every word.

476
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:14,945
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?

477
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:17,411
There's no certainty, only opportunity.

478
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:20,142
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up...

479
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:22,218
...Creedy'll black-bag every one of them.

480
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,954
People should not be afraid
of their governments.

481
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:26,988
Governments should be afraid
of their people.

482
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:29,558
And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?

483
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:34,264
The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.

484
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:36,195
Symbols are given power by people.

485
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:40,134
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people...

486
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:42,967
...blowing up a building
can change the world.

487
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:45,902
I wish I believed that was possible.

488
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:50,610
But every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.

489
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:54,775
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>I know this is not a man.</i>

490
00:32:54,952 --> 00:32:57,944
- What is he?
<i>- A man does not wear a mask.</i>

491
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:01,387
- What is he?
<i>- A man does not threaten innocent civilians.</i>

492
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:05,024
<i>He's what every gutless,</i>
<i>freedom-hating terrorist is:</i>

493
00:33:05,196 --> 00:33:07,426
<i>A goddamn coward!</i>

494
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:11,935
There will be no negotiation.

495
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:14,594
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.

496
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:18,264
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.

497
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:21,139
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.

498
00:33:21,312 --> 00:33:24,770
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!

499
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:27,747
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.

500
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,184
Find another DOP
or find yourself another job.

501
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:35,249
<i>I'll tell you what I wish.</i>

502
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,387
<i>I wish I'd been there.</i>

503
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:39,655
<i>I wish I'd had the chance</i>
<i>for a face-to-face.</i>

504
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:41,628
<i>Just one chance, that's all I'd need.</i>

505
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:50,940
<i>This so-called V and his accomplice,</i>
<i>Evey Hammond...</i>

506
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:54,408
<i>... neo-demagogues,</i>
<i>spouting their message of hate.</i>

507
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:59,141
<i>A delusional and aberrant voice</i>
<i>delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.</i>

508
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:03,014
<i>An ultimatum that was met</i>
<i>with swift and surgically precise justice.</i>

509
00:34:03,187 --> 00:34:05,985
- No mercy!
<i>- The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:</i>

510
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:08,352
Good guys win, bad guys lose...

511
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:11,927
...and, as always, England prevails!

512
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:15,865
Holy Christ! Jesus!

513
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:19,135
Good evening, Commander Prothero.

514
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:21,863
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

515
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:25,167
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by...

516
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:27,573
...any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.

517
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:29,542
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?

518
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:34,476
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.

519
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:36,381
You wore a uniform in those days.

520
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,148
You.

521
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:46,019
- It is you.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past.

522
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:57,465
- Yeah?
<i>- Finch, it's Dascomb.</i>

523
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:00,743
- Dascomb.
<i>- I've already called the chancellor.</i>

524
00:35:00,912 --> 00:35:04,746
<i>- We have to get control of the situation.</i>
- What situation?

525
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:10,310
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.

526
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:13,048
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London...

527
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:15,249
...could be devastating to our credibility.

528
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:18,221
Perhaps a stroke?

529
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:21,163
No, no, it's too horrific.

530
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:25,063
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.

531
00:35:26,337 --> 00:35:28,999
- We got any eyes or ears on this?
- No, camcos were cut.

532
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:33,667
It's the same m.o. As before.
But we got an elevator log ID.

533
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:37,246
- Let me guess.
- She's in deep, inspector.

534
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:39,305
V?

535
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,258
My fat, metal friend.

536
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:02,805
Mondego.

537
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:11,509
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.

538
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:15,348
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.

539
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,817
My favorite film:

540
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:21,448
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>,
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.

541
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:24,857
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego,</i>
<i>but your past that disarmed you.</i>

542
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:27,629
It gets me every time.

543
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,829
- Never seen it.
- Really?

544
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:33,265
- Would you like to?
- Does it have a happy ending?

545
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:35,697
As only celluloid can deliver.

546
00:36:36,073 --> 00:36:37,563
Okay.

547
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:39,707
Put the sword away.

548
00:36:40,244 --> 00:36:42,144
Forensics just wrapped.

549
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,979
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.

550
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,981
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.

551
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:50,211
- Drugs?
- Could've started his own hospital.

552
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:51,946
- Interesting.
- Why?

553
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:55,524
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country...

554
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,456
...before he was
the Voice of London?

555
00:36:57,628 --> 00:37:00,096
- Drugs?
- Legal ones.

556
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:03,028
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.

557
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,432
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?

558
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:11,132
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.

559
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:13,638
<i>May we come up?</i>

560
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:17,341
<i>- You find your own tree.</i>
- You find your own tree.

561
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:24,846
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

562
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:28,854
- But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
- Why?

563
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:32,861
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.

564
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:37,565
<i>- Nationwide were devastated</i>
<i>as news of the most popular...</i>

565
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:38,963
Wait. What's this?

566
00:37:39,136 --> 00:37:41,832
<i>- Most awarded stars</i>
<i>in the history of the BTN...</i>

567
00:37:42,006 --> 00:37:45,100
<i>... a man known to the entire nation</i>
<i>as "The Voice of London"...</i>

568
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:48,074
<i>... passed away late last night</i>
<i>from apparent heart failure.</i>

569
00:37:49,513 --> 00:37:52,505
- She's lying.
- How do you know?

570
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:55,675
She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.

571
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:58,014
<i>It came as no surprise</i>
<i>to those who knew him...</i>

572
00:37:58,189 --> 00:37:59,918
<i>... that his body was at his office...</i>

573
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:03,822
<i>... where he often worked long hours</i>
<i>after everyone else had gone home.</i>

574
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:06,520
<i>Lewis, you will be sorely missed.</i>

575
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:16,201
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

576
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:18,069
You didn't take it, did you?

577
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:21,271
Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

578
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:25,208
Did you have anything to do with that?

579
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:28,318
- Yes, I killed him.
- You...

580
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:29,953
- Oh, God.
- You're upset.

581
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:32,589
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

582
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:36,158
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

583
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:38,795
- What?
- Violence can be used for good.

584
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:41,723
- What are you talking about?
- Justice.

585
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:48,164
Oh, I see.

586
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:51,134
There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

587
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,635
And are you going to kill more people?

588
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:57,446
Yes.

589
00:38:58,082 --> 00:38:59,913
Take a look at this.

590
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:02,552
Prothero's military record.

591
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:04,887
What do you see?

592
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:12,025
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

593
00:39:12,196 --> 00:39:13,788
- Busy boy.
- But after all that...

594
00:39:13,964 --> 00:39:17,627
...they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

595
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:20,600
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

596
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,740
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

597
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:28,777
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

598
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:33,276
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

599
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:38,787
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

600
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:42,323
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.

601
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:46,020
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill...

602
00:39:46,197 --> 00:39:48,722
...approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

603
00:39:48,899 --> 00:39:50,025
Well, there you have it.

604
00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:54,527
This is a matter of some urgency, major.

605
00:39:54,705 --> 00:39:57,868
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

606
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:00,370
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

607
00:40:00,544 --> 00:40:03,308
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

608
00:40:03,848 --> 00:40:06,578
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?

609
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:09,652
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?

610
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,017
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...

611
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:17,718
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

612
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:19,829
As head of the Detention Program
at that...

613
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:23,865
Before you go any further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.

614
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:26,732
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

615
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:29,498
We all did what we had to do.

616
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:32,904
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

617
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:34,908
That's all I have to say about that.

618
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:43,017
You can do this.

619
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:54,597
Hi.

620
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:57,757
I've been thinking...

621
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:01,099
There's something I want to ask you...

622
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:05,106
...but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

623
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:10,879
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

624
00:41:11,782 --> 00:41:14,216
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth...

625
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:16,819
...while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

626
00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:19,148
A man after my own heart.

627
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:21,985
He always told the best stories.

628
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:25,457
Until my brother died.

629
00:41:27,898 --> 00:41:29,763
That was when everything changed.

630
00:41:30,634 --> 00:41:34,092
<i>My brother was one of the students</i>
<i>at St. Mary's.</i>

631
00:41:34,271 --> 00:41:38,105
<i>After he died,</i>
<i>my parents became political.</i>

632
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:43,673
<i>They protested the war</i>
<i>and the Reclamation.</i>

633
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:48,512
<i>When Sutler was appointed high chancellor,</i>
<i>they were at the riot in Leeds.</i>

634
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:50,654
<i>I watched on the television...</i>

635
00:41:50,821 --> 00:41:53,255
<i>... thinking I was going</i>
<i>to see my parents killed.</i>

636
00:41:53,824 --> 00:41:56,292
<i>I remember them arguing at night.</i>

637
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,793
<i>Mum wanted to leave the country.</i>
<i>Dad refused.</i>

638
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:02,990
<i>He said if we ran away, they would win.</i>

639
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,964
<i>Win, like...</i>

640
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:06,830
<i>... it was a game.</i>

641
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:10,471
Evey, quick, hide!

642
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:27,390
- Mummy!
- Evey!

643
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:28,957
<i>I never saw them again.</i>

644
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:33,293
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

645
00:42:33,664 --> 00:42:35,222
I'm sorry, Evey.

646
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,993
No, I'm the one that's sorry.

647
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:40,466
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

648
00:42:40,638 --> 00:42:43,630
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

649
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:46,499
...but I'm not.

650
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:50,374
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

651
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:53,514
...but I am.

652
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:57,245
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

653
00:42:57,421 --> 00:43:02,222
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...

654
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:05,359
...please let me know.

655
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:07,190
If you wish.

656
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:17,398
Do you really think
you'll find something here?

657
00:43:17,574 --> 00:43:19,098
Worth a shot.

658
00:43:19,843 --> 00:43:22,038
One thing is true of all governments:

659
00:43:22,212 --> 00:43:26,012
The most reliable records
are tax records.

660
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:35,822
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

661
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:39,895
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

662
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:44,057
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

663
00:43:44,234 --> 00:43:46,498
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

664
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,138
Thanks. This is a great help.

665
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:04,078
"By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe."

666
00:44:04,254 --> 00:44:07,382
- Personal motto?
- From <i>Faust.</i>

667
00:44:07,558 --> 00:44:09,992
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

668
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,321
It is. And speaking of the devil...

669
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:15,260
...I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

670
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:17,764
- Of course.
- It appears unforeseen circumstances...

671
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:20,733
...have accelerated my original plan.

672
00:44:20,904 --> 00:44:24,635
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

673
00:44:24,808 --> 00:44:26,070
I'll do my best.

674
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:28,340
I believe you will.

675
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:36,813
Another doctor. Why does
a detention facility need so many doctors?

676
00:44:36,987 --> 00:44:38,887
I don't know, but this is interesting.

677
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:42,514
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

678
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:45,787
- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.

679
00:44:45,963 --> 00:44:49,797
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

680
00:44:50,634 --> 00:44:52,192
Now, that is interesting.

681
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:56,764
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

682
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:02,145
- Your Grace.
- Oh, Denis.

683
00:45:02,312 --> 00:45:04,007
- Has everything been arranged?
- Yes.

684
00:45:04,181 --> 00:45:06,308
I've just received your InterLink itinerary.

685
00:45:06,483 --> 00:45:09,350
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

686
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,010
You're most diligent, Denis...

687
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:15,147
...a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...

688
00:45:15,325 --> 00:45:17,885
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

689
00:45:18,062 --> 00:45:21,088
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

690
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:23,494
My last little joy.

691
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:25,430
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

692
00:45:26,637 --> 00:45:29,936
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

693
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:33,338
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

694
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,909
Older?

695
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:37,240
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

696
00:45:37,414 --> 00:45:39,644
That is for Your Grace to decide.

697
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:54,423
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.

698
00:45:56,033 --> 00:46:01,027
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

699
00:46:02,973 --> 00:46:05,635
Mea culpa, my child.

700
00:46:05,809 --> 00:46:07,071
Mea culpa.

701
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:16,117
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

702
00:46:16,286 --> 00:46:20,313
A confession?
I love the confessional game.

703
00:46:20,824 --> 00:46:22,382
Tell me your sins.

704
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:24,390
This isn't a game, Your Grace.

705
00:46:24,561 --> 00:46:26,859
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

706
00:46:27,131 --> 00:46:28,792
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this...

707
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:31,526
...because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

708
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:35,365
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

709
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:38,633
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?

710
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:40,674
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...

711
00:46:40,844 --> 00:46:44,041
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.

712
00:46:44,214 --> 00:46:47,513
I'm telling you that any moment,
he's going to come through that door.

713
00:46:47,718 --> 00:46:51,051
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.

714
00:46:51,221 --> 00:46:53,519
Wonderful!

715
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,988
It's a game I've never played!

716
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,119
What a delightful mind you have.
I hope the rest of you is just as interesting.

717
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:03,562
- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.

718
00:47:03,734 --> 00:47:05,827
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.

719
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:07,436
Stop it! Get off of me!

720
00:47:07,738 --> 00:47:09,729
Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.

721
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:12,000
Now, how best to procure
her confession?

722
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:17,080
You little bitch. You fucking little whore!

723
00:47:20,017 --> 00:47:21,609
- Reverend.
- Oh, my God.

724
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:23,480
She wasn't lying. It is you.

725
00:47:23,654 --> 00:47:25,679
I'm sorry.

726
00:47:25,856 --> 00:47:27,551
- I had to.
- Evey!

727
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:34,456
And thus I clothe my naked villainy...

728
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:37,657
...with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ...

729
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:40,962
...and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.

730
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:43,106
Oh, please, have mercy.

731
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:45,207
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.

732
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:47,070
<i>Not tonight.</i>

733
00:47:49,613 --> 00:47:51,171
<i>Don't do this, I beg of you.</i>

734
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:53,509
Well, then. Children's hour at the abbey.

735
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:55,675
<i>Open your mouth</i>
<i>and stick out your tongue.</i>

736
00:47:55,852 --> 00:47:59,185
- What the...?
<i>- I don't want to die!</i>

737
00:48:00,023 --> 00:48:02,617
This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.

738
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:09,095
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.

739
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:10,927
- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.

740
00:48:11,301 --> 00:48:13,667
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.

741
00:48:14,438 --> 00:48:17,134
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.

742
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:23,278
Creedy.

743
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,808
What are you doing here?

744
00:48:25,782 --> 00:48:29,843
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.

745
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,252
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.

746
00:48:34,424 --> 00:48:37,222
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.

747
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:40,420
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.

748
00:48:40,597 --> 00:48:43,794
The security of information
is paramount.

749
00:48:44,334 --> 00:48:45,801
In these volatile times...

750
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:48,802
...mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated...

751
00:48:48,972 --> 00:48:51,338
...if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.

752
00:48:51,508 --> 00:48:53,772
- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have...

753
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:56,538
...a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

754
00:48:56,713 --> 00:48:59,511
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

755
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:02,214
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

756
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:04,149
At this time, it would behoove you...

757
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:09,315
...to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed...

758
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:12,894
...and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

759
00:49:13,563 --> 00:49:14,860
You mean Larkhill?

760
00:49:15,032 --> 00:49:18,593
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

761
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:22,034
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?

762
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,141
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

763
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:29,938
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

764
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:33,811
I've been a party member for 27 years.

765
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:36,282
If I were you, chief inspector...

766
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:38,614
...l'd find the terrorist...

767
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:40,757
...and I'd find him soon.

768
00:49:44,094 --> 00:49:45,618
Please.

769
00:49:49,866 --> 00:49:51,925
Evey? Good God!

770
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:54,627
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.

771
00:49:56,606 --> 00:49:59,598
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.

772
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:10,746
- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.

773
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:13,583
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.

774
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:16,157
- Evey...
- You could be in terrible trouble.

775
00:50:16,326 --> 00:50:17,816
Evey, listen to me.

776
00:50:17,994 --> 00:50:21,862
If the government ever searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

777
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:27,696
You trusted me.

778
00:50:27,871 --> 00:50:30,931
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

779
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:46,712
Oh, my God.
That's <i>God Save the Queen</i>.

780
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:49,586
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

781
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:53,820
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.

782
00:50:53,997 --> 00:50:56,795
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel...

783
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:58,798
...it always cheers me up.

784
00:51:00,937 --> 00:51:04,964
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

785
00:51:05,142 --> 00:51:07,303
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.

786
00:51:08,111 --> 00:51:09,510
But why would you keep it?

787
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:12,910
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful, poetry moving.

788
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:15,051
Is it worth it?
If they found that here...

789
00:51:15,218 --> 00:51:17,516
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

790
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:20,123
Thank you, Gordon.

791
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:22,417
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.

792
00:51:22,592 --> 00:51:26,050
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.

793
00:51:26,229 --> 00:51:28,424
I was on my way here, and...

794
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:31,700
Yes.

795
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:37,430
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

796
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:39,741
- But...
- You're wondering why...

797
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,470
...you were invited here to supper
in the first place...

798
00:51:42,646 --> 00:51:46,707
...if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

799
00:51:46,883 --> 00:51:50,444
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain...

800
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,214
...young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

801
00:51:53,423 --> 00:51:57,189
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired...

802
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,319
...I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a television show.

803
00:52:01,498 --> 00:52:04,467
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

804
00:52:05,802 --> 00:52:07,667
The truth is, after so many years...

805
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:11,274
...you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

806
00:52:11,441 --> 00:52:15,468
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

807
00:52:17,013 --> 00:52:21,279
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

808
00:52:21,451 --> 00:52:24,477
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.

809
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:27,213
Thanks, Delia.

810
00:52:28,024 --> 00:52:31,391
Any leads on finding this guy?

811
00:52:31,561 --> 00:52:34,894
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.

812
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:40,693
You started as a botanist, didn't you?

813
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:44,572
It's... It's a Scarlet Carson.

814
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:48,408
They're believed to be extinct.

815
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:51,505
He leaves them at the crime scenes.

816
00:52:52,148 --> 00:52:54,378
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.

817
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:57,109
Any information could be helpful.

818
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:59,445
Of course.

819
00:53:00,857 --> 00:53:02,256
Excuse me.

820
00:53:03,026 --> 00:53:04,220
Yeah?

821
00:53:04,394 --> 00:53:08,660
<i>I just finished going through the file,</i>
<i>inspector. You better get back here.</i>

822
00:53:08,832 --> 00:53:10,299
Yeah, okay.

823
00:53:12,068 --> 00:53:15,162
- My God. He's killed them all.
- All but one.

824
00:53:16,306 --> 00:53:18,797
- Who is she?
- Not sure.

825
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,535
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.

826
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:25,203
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

827
00:53:25,382 --> 00:53:27,976
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.

828
00:53:28,585 --> 00:53:30,018
Running away?

829
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:34,350
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

830
00:53:34,524 --> 00:53:36,924
- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.

831
00:53:37,093 --> 00:53:40,153
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.

832
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:43,663
- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.

833
00:53:56,046 --> 00:53:57,445
What? Are you sure about that?

834
00:53:57,948 --> 00:53:59,347
Okay. Thank you.

835
00:54:00,317 --> 00:54:03,718
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.

836
00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:06,147
- The coroner?
- Yeah.

837
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:08,424
Jesus, I just saw her.

838
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:19,298
It's you, isn't it?

839
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:23,030
- You've come to kill me.
- Yes.

840
00:54:24,507 --> 00:54:26,407
Thank God.

841
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:31,013
<i>I'm sorry, I can't get a response</i>
<i>from that number.</i>

842
00:54:31,181 --> 00:54:33,115
<i>There's a problem with the connection.</i>

843
00:54:33,283 --> 00:54:35,114
Jesus Christ.

844
00:54:35,652 --> 00:54:37,085
He's there.

845
00:54:38,154 --> 00:54:41,555
After what happened,
after what they did...

846
00:54:41,992 --> 00:54:44,051
...I thought about killing myself.

847
00:54:46,363 --> 00:54:49,423
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.

848
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:52,929
I didn't know what
they were going to do.

849
00:54:53,737 --> 00:54:55,329
I swear to you.

850
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:57,139
Read my journal.

851
00:54:57,307 --> 00:55:00,538
What they did was only possible
because of you.

852
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:06,011
Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.

853
00:55:06,182 --> 00:55:09,015
He changed the entire course
of human history.

854
00:55:10,253 --> 00:55:12,847
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?

855
00:55:13,056 --> 00:55:16,184
I have not come
for what you hoped to do.

856
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:18,224
I've come for what you did.

857
00:55:19,796 --> 00:55:21,024
It's funny.

858
00:55:21,197 --> 00:55:24,030
I was given one of your roses today.

859
00:55:25,268 --> 00:55:28,499
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.

860
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:34,337
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.

861
00:55:35,412 --> 00:55:38,006
There are no coincidences, Delia.

862
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:41,150
Only the illusion of coincidence.

863
00:55:41,317 --> 00:55:43,308
I have another rose.

864
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:46,853
And this one is for you.

865
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:56,365
- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 10 minutes ago...

866
00:55:57,133 --> 00:55:58,930
...while you slept.

867
00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:02,665
- Is there any pain?
- No.

868
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:04,304
Thank you.

869
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,838
Is it meaningless to apologize?

870
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,372
Never.

871
00:56:12,582 --> 00:56:14,550
I'm so sorry.

872
00:56:36,172 --> 00:56:37,901
Damn it.

873
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:43,243
The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.

874
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:46,974
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.

875
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,176
<i>Am I to understand that you have read</i>
<i>this document, inspector?</i>

876
00:56:50,386 --> 00:56:52,445
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Has anyone else read it?</i>

877
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:55,489
- No, sir.
<i>- Then let me make this perfectly clear to you.</i>

878
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:59,150
<i>The contents of this document</i>
<i>are a matter of national security...</i>

879
00:56:59,329 --> 00:57:03,197
<i>... constituting an assault on the character</i>
<i>of several important party members...</i>

880
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:06,831
<i>... as well as a blatant violation</i>
<i>of the Articles of Allegiance.</i>

881
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:09,904
<i>As the authenticity of this document</i>
<i>cannot be verified...</i>

882
00:57:10,073 --> 00:57:13,907
<i>... it could be an elaborate forgery</i>
<i>created by the terrorist...</i>

883
00:57:14,077 --> 00:57:17,774
<i>... as easily as it could be the deranged</i>
<i>fantasy of a former party member...</i>

884
00:57:17,947 --> 00:57:20,108
<i>... who resigned</i>
<i>for psychological reasons.</i>

885
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:23,177
<i>Any discussion of this document</i>
<i>or its contents...</i>

886
00:57:23,353 --> 00:57:26,288
<i>... will be regarded, at the very least,</i>
<i>as an act of sedition...</i>

887
00:57:26,456 --> 00:57:28,924
<i>... if not a willful act of treason.</i>

888
00:57:29,092 --> 00:57:32,425
<i>- Is that understood, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Yes, sir.

889
00:57:32,595 --> 00:57:35,291
<i>You would do well, inspector...</i>

890
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:37,865
<i>... to put it out of your mind.</i>

891
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:48,773
<i>May 23rd.</i>

892
00:57:50,146 --> 00:57:53,013
<i>My first batch of subjects arrived today...</i>

893
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,917
<i>... and I have to admit</i>
<i>that I'm very excited.</i>

894
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:02,889
<i>This could be the dawn of a new age.</i>

895
00:58:03,893 --> 00:58:05,827
<i>Nuclear power is meaningless...</i>

896
00:58:05,995 --> 00:58:08,964
<i>... in a world where a virus</i>
<i>can kill an entire population...</i>

897
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:11,191
<i>... and leave its wealth intact.</i>

898
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:14,495
- Stay together!
- Come on, move!

899
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:16,962
<i>May 27th.</i>

900
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,268
<i>Commander Prothero toured the lab</i>
<i>with a priest, Father Lilliman...</i>

901
00:58:20,443 --> 00:58:24,277
<i>... who I was told is here to monitor</i>
<i>for Rules and Rights violations.</i>

902
00:58:24,447 --> 00:58:28,713
<i>It made me nervous, but the commander</i>
<i>assured me there wouldn't be a problem.</i>

903
00:58:28,918 --> 00:58:30,749
<i>June 2nd.</i>

904
00:58:31,387 --> 00:58:35,118
<i>I keep wondering if these people knew</i>
<i>how they might be helping their country...</i>

905
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:37,623
<i>... if they would act any differently.</i>

906
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:41,730
<i>They're so weak and pathetic.</i>
<i>They never look you in the eye.</i>

907
00:58:41,898 --> 00:58:44,366
<i>I find myself hating them.</i>

908
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,404
<i>August the 18th.</i>

909
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:53,338
<i>Of the original four dozen,</i>
<i>over 75 percent are now deceased.</i>

910
00:58:55,845 --> 00:58:59,110
<i>No controllable pattern has yet emerged.</i>

911
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:02,614
<i>September the 18th.</i>

912
00:59:02,785 --> 00:59:05,845
<i>There is one case that continues</i>
<i>to give me hope.</i>

913
00:59:06,022 --> 00:59:10,686
<i>He exhibits none of the immune-system</i>
<i>pathologies the other subjects developed.</i>

914
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:15,354
<i>I've discovered cellular anomalies in his</i>
<i>blood that I've been unable to categorize.</i>

915
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:17,362
<i>The mutations seem to have triggered...</i>

916
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:21,492
<i>... the abnormal development</i>
<i>of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.</i>

917
00:59:21,671 --> 00:59:23,832
<i>The subject said</i>
<i>he could no longer remember...</i>

918
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:26,737
<i>... who he was or where he was from.</i>

919
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:30,676
<i>Whoever he was,</i>
<i>he is now the key to our dream...</i>

920
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:34,374
<i>... and the hope that all of this</i>
<i>will not have been in vain.</i>

921
00:59:35,652 --> 00:59:37,142
<i>November the 5th.</i>

922
00:59:39,622 --> 00:59:42,785
<i>It started last night, around midnight.</i>

923
00:59:42,959 --> 00:59:46,827
<i>The first explosions tore open</i>
<i>the entire medical section.</i>

924
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:50,829
<i>All my work, gone.</i>

925
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,027
<i>I was trying to understand how</i>
<i>it could've happened when I saw him.</i>

926
00:59:55,204 --> 00:59:57,434
<i>The man from room 5.</i>

927
00:59:57,607 --> 00:59:58,835
<i>He looked at me.</i>

928
00:59:59,008 --> 01:00:02,444
<i>Not with eyes. There were no eyes.</i>

929
01:00:02,612 --> 01:00:05,137
<i>But I know he was looking at me</i>
<i>because I felt it.</i>

930
01:00:12,689 --> 01:00:14,714
<i>Oh, God...</i>

931
01:00:14,891 --> 01:00:16,620
<i>... what have I done?</i>

932
01:00:48,758 --> 01:00:50,191
What is that you're making?

933
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,885
We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.

934
01:00:53,062 --> 01:00:54,893
- This is weird.
- What?

935
01:00:55,064 --> 01:00:58,522
The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.

936
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:00,999
- Really?
- I swear.

937
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:05,937
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.

938
01:01:06,109 --> 01:01:08,043
- There is?
- Yes, Evey.

939
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:10,039
I am V.

940
01:01:10,213 --> 01:01:11,680
At last you know the truth.

941
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:13,546
You're stunned, I know.

942
01:01:13,716 --> 01:01:17,345
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...

943
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:22,719
...there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.

944
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:26,026
That is not funny, Gordon.

945
01:01:26,195 --> 01:01:28,857
Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.

946
01:01:29,465 --> 01:01:31,592
I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.

947
01:01:31,768 --> 01:01:33,668
Of course, he was right, wasn't he?

948
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:37,204
There is something wrong
with this country.

949
01:01:53,289 --> 01:01:54,779
Morning, inspector.

950
01:01:56,526 --> 01:01:58,289
You're at it early.

951
01:01:59,862 --> 01:02:03,525
Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.

952
01:02:11,808 --> 01:02:14,299
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.

953
01:02:15,678 --> 01:02:18,044
I don't care if you answer me or not.

954
01:02:19,015 --> 01:02:21,210
I just wanna say this aloud.

955
01:02:22,485 --> 01:02:26,251
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.

956
01:02:26,422 --> 01:02:28,720
Yeah, of course, inspector, but...

957
01:02:29,826 --> 01:02:31,225
Because of the terrorist?

958
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:34,026
No.

959
01:02:35,198 --> 01:02:38,292
So, what is it, chief? What's going on?

960
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:44,562
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's...

961
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:46,873
...and Three Waters.

962
01:02:49,045 --> 01:02:53,448
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours...

963
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:56,414
...the question I have to ask, is:

964
01:02:57,954 --> 01:03:00,821
What if the worst...

965
01:03:01,524 --> 01:03:05,085
...the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history...

966
01:03:05,261 --> 01:03:09,027
...was not the work
of religious extremists?

967
01:03:09,198 --> 01:03:12,861
Well, I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

968
01:03:13,035 --> 01:03:15,162
And they were executed. I know.

969
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:18,330
And maybe that's really what happened.

970
01:03:20,676 --> 01:03:23,270
But I see this chain of events...

971
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:28,311
...these coincidences,
and I have to ask:

972
01:03:28,484 --> 01:03:33,080
What if that isn't what happened?
What if someone else unleashed that virus?

973
01:03:33,256 --> 01:03:37,317
What if someone else
killed all those people?

974
01:03:37,493 --> 01:03:39,791
Would you really wanna know
who it was?

975
01:03:40,796 --> 01:03:42,229
Sure.

976
01:03:42,398 --> 01:03:44,730
Even if it was someone
working for this government?

977
01:03:46,669 --> 01:03:48,227
That's my question.

978
01:03:48,704 --> 01:03:51,468
If our own government was responsible...

979
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:55,941
...for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...

980
01:03:57,914 --> 01:04:04,285
...if our own government was responsible
for the deaths of almost 100,000 people...

981
01:04:07,256 --> 01:04:08,917
...would you really wanna know?

982
01:04:09,325 --> 01:04:11,555
<i>This has to be the bloody coldest</i>
<i>March in years.</i>

983
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:14,127
<i>Keep talking like that,</i>
<i>we'll lose our party status.</i>

984
01:04:14,297 --> 01:04:18,028
<i>- They're a pack of lying, greedy hypocrites!</i>
<i>- Keep it down, will you?</i>

985
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:25,169
Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now...

986
01:04:25,374 --> 01:04:28,571
...80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.

987
01:04:29,312 --> 01:04:31,507
We're also showing
a 12-percent increase...

988
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:35,139
...over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.

989
01:04:35,318 --> 01:04:38,810
<i>- Mr. Creedy?</i>
- We're handling it as best we can.

990
01:04:38,988 --> 01:04:41,650
Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.

991
01:04:41,824 --> 01:04:44,292
<i>I want more than arrests. I want results.</i>

992
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:50,689
- What's all this about?
- I'm celebrating.

993
01:04:50,866 --> 01:04:52,993
Celebrating what?

994
01:04:53,169 --> 01:04:56,195
I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.

995
01:04:56,372 --> 01:04:58,169
<i>Very good evening,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

996
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:02,640
<i>Listen, we've got an extraordinary</i>
<i>show for you tonight.</i>

997
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:06,210
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>
<i>As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.</i>

998
01:05:06,382 --> 01:05:08,873
<i>Will you please give</i>
<i>a very warm welcome...</i>

999
01:05:09,051 --> 01:05:12,452
<i>... to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!</i>

1000
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:18,517
- No way!
- No, it can't be!

1001
01:05:20,363 --> 01:05:23,890
We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.

1002
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,658
Oh, my God.

1003
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,943
<i>Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor...</i>

1004
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:42,949
<i>... I understand you've been under</i>
<i>tremendous strain lately...</i>

1005
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,247
<i>... since the beginning</i>
<i>of this whole terrorism business...</i>

1006
01:05:46,422 --> 01:05:50,518
<i>... and we thought it would be a nice idea</i>
<i>to try and help you relax. Girls?</i>

1007
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:59,964
<i>Warm milk. There's nothing better.</i>

1008
01:06:00,136 --> 01:06:03,162
<i>I understand you enjoy a glass</i>
<i>every night, chancellor.</i>

1009
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:05,136
<i>Since I was a boy.</i>

1010
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:07,800
<i>But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.</i>

1011
01:06:07,977 --> 01:06:11,743
<i>- The terrorist was never a serious concern.</i>
<i>- Oh, really?</i>

1012
01:06:11,914 --> 01:06:14,144
<i>- Chancellor, chancellor...</i>
- It's him.

1013
01:06:14,317 --> 01:06:17,548
<i>Are you saying that he's not still alive</i>
<i>and active?</i>

1014
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,382
<i>The terrorist has been neutralized.</i>

1015
01:06:22,058 --> 01:06:24,754
<i>Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!</i>

1016
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:26,554
<i>The terrorist!</i>

1017
01:06:27,129 --> 01:06:28,653
<i>The terrorist!</i>

1018
01:06:30,399 --> 01:06:32,094
<i>Get him!</i>

1019
01:06:34,537 --> 01:06:36,630
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

1020
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:57,416
<i>At last!</i>

1021
01:06:57,593 --> 01:07:01,529
<i>And now, for all the world to see.</i>

1022
01:07:02,698 --> 01:07:03,926
It's him!

1023
01:07:05,101 --> 01:07:09,094
<i>Unhand me! I am your chancellor!</i>

1024
01:07:09,271 --> 01:07:12,968
<i>How dare you! I am the chancellor!</i>

1025
01:07:13,275 --> 01:07:15,209
<i>Imposter!</i>

1026
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:23,845
<i>Soldiers! That man is the terrorist!</i>

1027
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:26,954
<i>- I order you to shoot that traitor!</i>
<i>- Liar!</i>

1028
01:07:27,123 --> 01:07:28,147
<i>- Faker!</i>
<i>- Fraud!</i>

1029
01:07:28,324 --> 01:07:30,189
<i>- Ready!</i>
<i>- Aim!</i>

1030
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:31,826
<i>- Fire!</i>
<i>- Fire!</i>

1031
01:07:43,706 --> 01:07:45,697
What are they gonna do, fine us?

1032
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:49,333
Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.

1033
01:07:49,512 --> 01:07:52,003
Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.

1034
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:54,046
Protect me.

1035
01:07:54,216 --> 01:07:56,047
I should've hired him
to be my mother.

1036
01:07:56,218 --> 01:07:58,982
- You're mad.
- Either that or I wasn't breast-fed.

1037
01:07:59,155 --> 01:08:02,147
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Only the things that matter.

1038
01:08:02,324 --> 01:08:05,555
- What if they come after you?
- I tell you what's gonna happen.

1039
01:08:05,728 --> 01:08:08,925
I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.

1040
01:08:09,098 --> 01:08:14,161
In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.

1041
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:22,725
Gordon?

1042
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:26,997
Quick, Evey, hide!

1043
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:45,317
Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?

1044
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,330
- Gotcha.
- No, no.

1045
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,917
Do you know why you're here,
Evey Hammond?

1046
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,419
Please.

1047
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,992
You've been charged
with three counts of murder...

1048
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:03,021
...the bombing of government property,
conspiracy to commit terrorism...

1049
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:08,102
...treason and sedition, the penalty
for which is death by firing squad.

1050
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:14,708
You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.

1051
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:18,836
You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts...

1052
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:20,880
...of code name V.

1053
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:24,178
If your information leads
to his capture...

1054
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:28,153
...you will be released
from this facility immediately.

1055
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,918
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

1056
01:10:31,094 --> 01:10:34,188
You can return to your life,
Miss Hammond.

1057
01:10:35,298 --> 01:10:38,699
All you have to do is cooperate.

1058
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:44,697
Process her.

1059
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:55,165
<i>I know there's no way I can convince you</i>
<i>this is not one of their tricks...</i>

1060
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:56,737
<i>... but I don't care.</i>

1061
01:12:56,906 --> 01:12:58,703
<i>I am me.</i>

1062
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,603
<i>My name is Valerie.</i>

1063
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:05,804
<i>I don't think I'll live much longer,</i>
<i>and I wanted to tell someone about my life.</i>

1064
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:10,385
<i>This is the only autobiography</i>
<i>that I will ever write and, God...</i>

1065
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,286
<i>... I'm writing it on toilet paper.</i>

1066
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,956
<i>I was born in Nottingham in 1985.</i>

1067
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:23,929
<i>I don't remember much of those early years,</i>
<i>but I do remember the rain.</i>

1068
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,568
<i>My grandmother owned a farm</i>
<i>in Tottle Brook...</i>

1069
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:29,603
<i>... and she used to tell me</i>
<i>that God was in the rain.</i>

1070
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:32,536
<i>I passed my 11 Plus</i>
<i>and went to girls' grammar.</i>

1071
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:35,438
<i>It was at school</i>
<i>that I met my first girlfriend.</i>

1072
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:37,203
<i>Her name was Sarah.</i>

1073
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:39,405
<i>It was her wrists.</i>

1074
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,209
<i>They were beautiful.</i>

1075
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:46,151
<i>I thought we would</i>
<i>love each other forever.</i>

1076
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:49,017
<i>I remember our teacher telling us...</i>

1077
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:51,887
<i>... that it was an adolescent phase</i>
<i>that people outgrew.</i>

1078
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:53,619
<i>Sarah did.</i>

1079
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:56,995
<i>I didn't.</i>

1080
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:01,329
<i>In 2002, I fell in love</i>
<i>with a girl named Christina.</i>

1081
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:03,699
<i>That year I came out to my parents.</i>

1082
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:07,536
<i>I couldn't have done it</i>
<i>without Chris holding my hand.</i>

1083
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:12,875
<i>My father wouldn't look at me.</i>
<i>He told me to go and never come back.</i>

1084
01:14:13,049 --> 01:14:14,710
<i>My mother said nothing.</i>

1085
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:19,610
<i>But I'd only told them the truth.</i>
<i>Was that so selfish?</i>

1086
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:24,591
<i>Our integrity sells for so little,</i>
<i>but it is all we really have.</i>

1087
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,921
<i>It is the very last inch of us.</i>

1088
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:29,663
<i>But within that inch...</i>

1089
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,060
<i>... we are free.</i>

1090
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:35,396
It ends whenever you want it to.

1091
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:38,165
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.

1092
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,244
<i>I'd always known</i>
<i>what I wanted to do with my life...</i>

1093
01:15:17,413 --> 01:15:22,612
<i>... and in 2015 I starred in my first film,</i>
The Salt Flats.

1094
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:27,582
<i>It was the most important role of my life.</i>
<i>Not because of my career...</i>

1095
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:29,748
<i>... but because that was how I met Ruth.</i>

1096
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:33,686
<i>The first time we kissed...</i>

1097
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:38,629
<i>... I knew I never wanted to kiss</i>
<i>any other lips but hers again.</i>

1098
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:47,907
<i>We moved to a small flat</i>
<i>in London together.</i>

1099
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:50,602
<i>She grew Scarlet Carsons for me</i>
<i>in our window box...</i>

1100
01:15:51,614 --> 01:15:54,344
<i>... and our place always smelt of roses.</i>

1101
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:58,846
<i>Those were the best years of my life.</i>

1102
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:06,995
<i>But America's war grew worse and worse,</i>
<i>and eventually came to London.</i>

1103
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:10,291
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler...

1104
01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:13,401
...to close the remaining tube stations
passed with...

1105
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,402
<i>After that, there were no roses anymore.</i>

1106
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:18,303
<i>Not for anyone.</i>

1107
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:20,567
You won't last much longer.

1108
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,404
You're gonna die here.

1109
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,638
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?

1110
01:16:36,492 --> 01:16:39,859
<i>I remember how the meaning of words</i>
<i>began to change.</i>

1111
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:46,558
<i>How unfamiliar words like "collateral"</i>
<i>and "rendition" became frightening...</i>

1112
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:52,004
<i>... while things like "Norsefire" and the</i>
<i>"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.</i>

1113
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,899
<i>I remember how "different"</i>
<i>became dangerous.</i>

1114
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:58,603
<i>I still don't understand it...</i>

1115
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:00,840
<i>... why they hate us so much.</i>

1116
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:09,283
<i>They took Ruth</i>
<i>while she was out buying food.</i>

1117
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:14,588
<i>I've never cried so hard in my life.</i>

1118
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,359
<i>It wasn't long till they came for me.</i>

1119
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:30,202
<i>It seems strange that my life should end</i>
<i>in such a terrible place.</i>

1120
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:35,783
<i>But for three years,</i>
<i>I had roses and apologized to no one.</i>

1121
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:40,213
<i>I shall die here.</i>

1122
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:43,916
<i>Every inch of me shall perish.</i>

1123
01:17:44,093 --> 01:17:45,788
<i>Every inch...</i>

1124
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:47,657
<i>... but one.</i>

1125
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,461
<i>An inch.</i>

1126
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,796
<i>It is small, and it is fragile...</i>

1127
01:17:56,972 --> 01:18:00,669
<i>... and it is the only thing</i>
<i>in the world worth having.</i>

1128
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:05,940
<i>We must never lose it or give it away.</i>
<i>We must never let them take it from us.</i>

1129
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:11,084
<i>I hope that, whoever you are,</i>
<i>you escape this place.</i>

1130
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:14,450
<i>I hope that the world turns</i>
<i>and that things get better.</i>

1131
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:19,553
<i>But what I hope most of all</i>
<i>is that you understand what I mean...</i>

1132
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:22,925
<i>... when I tell you that</i>
<i>even though I do not know you...</i>

1133
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:25,828
<i>... and even though</i>
<i>I may never meet you...</i>

1134
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:29,266
<i>... laugh with you, cry with you...</i>

1135
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:31,372
<i>... or kiss you...</i>

1136
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:33,638
<i>... I love you.</i>

1137
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:36,334
<i>With all my heart...</i>

1138
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:38,546
<i>... I love you.</i>

1139
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:41,615
<i>Valerie.</i>

1140
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:59,063
I'm instructed to inform you that you
have been convicted by special tribunal...

1141
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:04,194
...and that unless you are ready to offer
your cooperation, you are to be executed.

1142
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:08,139
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1143
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:11,976
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?

1144
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:18,051
- No.
- Very well.

1145
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,886
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.

1146
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:25,516
Arrange a detail of six men...

1147
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:28,663
...and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.

1148
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:45,909
It's time.

1149
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,015
I'm ready.

1150
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,449
Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.

1151
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,886
Just give them something, anything.

1152
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,258
Thank you...

1153
01:19:58,427 --> 01:20:01,419
...but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.

1154
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:05,897
Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.

1155
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:13,235
What?

1156
01:21:37,493 --> 01:21:38,983
Hello, Evey.

1157
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:41,824
You.

1158
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,832
- It was you?
- Yeah.

1159
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:48,931
That wasn't real?

1160
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:55,366
- Is Gordon...?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.

1161
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:56,976
I thought they'd arrest him...

1162
01:21:57,146 --> 01:22:00,411
...but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.

1163
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,573
Oh, God.

1164
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:06,813
- Fortunately, I got to you before they did.
- You got to me?

1165
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,388
You did this to me?

1166
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:13,427
You cut my hair?

1167
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:16,360
You tortured me?

1168
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,030
You tortured me.

1169
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:21,797
Why?

1170
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:27,408
You said you wanted to live without fear.
I wish there'd been an easier way...

1171
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:29,635
...but there wasn't.
- Oh, my God.

1172
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:31,712
I know you may never forgive me...

1173
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,943
...but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.

1174
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:38,177
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.

1175
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:40,748
Every day, I wanted to end it.

1176
01:22:40,923 --> 01:22:44,518
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.

1177
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:47,423
You're sick! You're evil!

1178
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:51,055
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.

1179
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:54,201
- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!

1180
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:57,930
That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.

1181
01:22:58,106 --> 01:23:00,666
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me...

1182
01:23:00,843 --> 01:23:03,334
...taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.

1183
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:07,073
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.

1184
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:09,183
But then something happened.

1185
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:11,751
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.

1186
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,787
Shut up! I don't want to hear your lies!

1187
01:23:14,957 --> 01:23:18,723
Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.

1188
01:23:18,894 --> 01:23:20,657
Yes, I created a lie.

1189
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,424
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.

1190
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,001
- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.

1191
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:31,230
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.

1192
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:34,000
I can't feel anything anymore!

1193
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:37,907
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.

1194
01:23:39,081 --> 01:23:40,878
I can't... Can't breathe.

1195
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:45,750
Asthma. When I was little...

1196
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:49,415
Listen to me, Evey.

1197
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:53,186
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.

1198
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:58,791
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.

1199
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:04,831
They put you in a cell and took everything
they could take except your life.

1200
01:24:05,007 --> 01:24:07,908
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?

1201
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:10,806
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.

1202
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:14,642
- Oh, please.
- You found something else.

1203
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:18,650
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.

1204
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:22,153
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave what they wanted...

1205
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,184
...you told them you'd rather die.

1206
01:24:25,761 --> 01:24:27,285
You faced your death, Evey.

1207
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:30,425
You were calm. You were still.

1208
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:32,999
Try to feel now what you felt then.

1209
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:41,142
Oh, God.

1210
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:44,976
I felt...

1211
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:47,080
Yes?

1212
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:50,848
I'm dizzy.

1213
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:53,112
I need air.

1214
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:56,519
Please, I need to be outside.

1215
01:24:56,692 --> 01:24:58,751
There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.

1216
01:25:17,346 --> 01:25:18,813
God is in the rain.

1217
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:25,011
V.

1218
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,515
I'm leaving.

1219
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:33,512
There are 872 songs in here.

1220
01:26:34,423 --> 01:26:37,586
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.

1221
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:40,887
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

1222
01:26:41,063 --> 01:26:42,530
I can't stay here.

1223
01:26:44,066 --> 01:26:45,590
I know.

1224
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:50,304
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.

1225
01:26:51,273 --> 01:26:53,434
I thought about keeping this...

1226
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:57,100
...but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.

1227
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:04,551
I didn't.

1228
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:08,781
May I show you something
before you go?

1229
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:22,128
- She was real.
- Yes.

1230
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:24,033
She's beautiful.

1231
01:27:25,173 --> 01:27:27,334
- Did you know her?
- No.

1232
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:30,177
She wrote the letter
just before she died.

1233
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:33,212
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.

1234
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:35,311
Then it really happened, didn't it?

1235
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:38,542
- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.

1236
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:43,749
And that's what this is all about.

1237
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:47,019
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.

1238
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:50,893
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.

1239
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:52,966
It's a basic principle of the universe...

1240
01:27:53,135 --> 01:27:56,070
...that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.

1241
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:57,637
Is that how you see it?

1242
01:27:57,806 --> 01:28:00,274
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.

1243
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:02,501
And they created a monster.

1244
01:28:13,088 --> 01:28:16,182
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.

1245
01:28:17,225 --> 01:28:19,853
That would have scared me before...

1246
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:21,723
...but I suppose I should thank you.

1247
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:34,935
Thank you.

1248
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,071
Goodbye.

1249
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:42,944
Evey...

1250
01:28:43,952 --> 01:28:46,921
...may I ask you for something?

1251
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:51,889
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once...

1252
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:53,788
...before the 5th.

1253
01:28:56,231 --> 01:28:58,699
- All right.
- Thank you.

1254
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,653
Chancellor, I know no one seems
to want to discuss this...

1255
01:29:23,825 --> 01:29:26,259
...but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality...

1256
01:29:26,428 --> 01:29:29,329
...then it can't be ignored any longer.

1257
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:34,025
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.

1258
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,635
Now, it concludes that...

1259
01:29:35,804 --> 01:29:39,205
...the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use...

1260
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,774
...would be an airborne attack.

1261
01:29:41,943 --> 01:29:43,570
A separate report has been filed...

1262
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:47,579
...suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament...

1263
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:49,307
...have been sealed shut.

1264
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:51,452
<i>Who filed that report?</i>

1265
01:29:52,621 --> 01:29:54,179
Chief Inspector Finch.

1266
01:29:54,356 --> 01:29:57,257
<i>Do you have any evidence</i>
<i>to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?</i>

1267
01:29:57,459 --> 01:29:59,984
No, sir. Just a feeling.

1268
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:02,129
<i>If I am sure of anything, inspector...</i>

1269
01:30:02,297 --> 01:30:06,461
<i>... it is that this government will not survive</i>
<i>if it is to be subject to your feelings.</i>

1270
01:30:06,635 --> 01:30:09,570
<i>Mr. Dascomb,</i>
<i>what we need right now...</i>

1271
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:12,798
<i>... is a clear message</i>
<i>to the people of this country.</i>

1272
01:30:12,974 --> 01:30:15,306
<i>This message must be read</i>
<i>in every newspaper...</i>

1273
01:30:15,477 --> 01:30:18,002
<i>... heard on every radio,</i>
<i>seen on every television.</i>

1274
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:22,206
<i>This message must resound</i>
<i>throughout the entire InterLink!</i>

1275
01:30:22,384 --> 01:30:25,785
<i>I want this country to realize</i>
<i>that we stand on the edge of oblivion.</i>

1276
01:30:25,954 --> 01:30:30,220
<i>I want every man, woman and child</i>
<i>to understand how close we are to chaos.</i>

1277
01:30:30,392 --> 01:30:32,326
<i>I want everyone...</i>

1278
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:36,224
<i>... to remember why they need us!</i>

1279
01:30:36,398 --> 01:30:40,926
<i>In the former United States, civil war</i>
<i>continues to devastate the Midwest.</i>

1280
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:45,402
<i>Scientists attribute this water shortage</i>
<i>to the lack of rainfall the last two years.</i>

1281
01:30:45,573 --> 01:30:48,701
<i>Ministry officials expect</i>
<i>water coupon prices to rise.</i>

1282
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:50,844
<i>Police have arrested nine suspects...</i>

1283
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:54,778
Can you believe this shit?
Been going on all summer.

1284
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:58,908
<i>Outside the quarantine zone, a new</i>
<i>airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.</i>

1285
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:03,413
<i>Authorities uncovered new evidence linking</i>
<i>the terrorist organization called V...</i>

1286
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:07,894
<i>... to the St. Mary's viral attack</i>
<i>on London 14 years ago.</i>

1287
01:31:19,908 --> 01:31:22,433
My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.

1288
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:24,506
There were three men.

1289
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:26,476
Covert intel.

1290
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:28,912
Original black-baggers, all under Creedy.

1291
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:33,785
Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.

1292
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:36,048
The day after
the St. Mary's outbreak...

1293
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:39,625
...Percy gives his Beretta a blowjob,
Keyes dies in a fire...

1294
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:41,284
Rookwood goes missing.

1295
01:31:41,463 --> 01:31:44,398
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.

1296
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:46,329
Rookwood.

1297
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,332
How do I know that name?

1298
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:58,535
Shit. He must have had a hidden trip
on his file at the Finger.

1299
01:31:58,747 --> 01:32:00,977
But how'd he know it was you?

1300
01:32:02,584 --> 01:32:04,108
What do we do?

1301
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:08,118
I'm a cop. I have to know.

1302
01:32:16,598 --> 01:32:19,931
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.

1303
01:32:21,603 --> 01:32:23,230
Still does.

1304
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:35,472
That's close enough, inspector.

1305
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:38,279
We're not wired.

1306
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:42,812
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.

1307
01:32:42,991 --> 01:32:46,256
- You have information for us?
- No, you already have the information.

1308
01:32:46,428 --> 01:32:48,487
All the names and dates
are inside your head.

1309
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:51,131
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.

1310
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:53,290
A story can be true or false.

1311
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:56,994
I leave such judgments to you, inspector.

1312
01:32:57,839 --> 01:33:01,275
Our story begins,
as these stories often do...

1313
01:33:01,443 --> 01:33:04,571
...with a young,
up-and-coming politician.

1314
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:08,705
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

1315
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:13,252
<i>He's completely single-minded</i>
<i>and has no regard for the political process.</i>

1316
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:16,584
<i>The more power he attains,</i>
<i>the more obvious his zealotry...</i>

1317
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:19,352
<i>... and the more aggressive</i>
<i>his supporters become.</i>

1318
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:25,358
<i>Eventually, his party launches a special</i>
<i>project in the name of national security.</i>

1319
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:28,934
<i>At first it's believed to be a search</i>
<i>for biological weapons...</i>

1320
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:31,867
<i>... and it's pursued without regard</i>
<i>to its cost.</i>

1321
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:35,771
<i>However, the true goal</i>
<i>of this project is power.</i>

1322
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:38,708
<i>Complete and total</i>
<i>hegemonic domination.</i>

1323
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,440
<i>The project, however, ends violently.</i>

1324
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:45,411
<i>But the efforts of those involved</i>
<i>are not in vain...</i>

1325
01:33:45,587 --> 01:33:50,615
<i>... for a new ability to wage war is born</i>
<i>from the blood of one of the victims.</i>

1326
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:54,387
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can...

1327
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:57,588
...and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.

1328
01:33:57,765 --> 01:34:02,668
<i>But if your ultimate goal is power,</i>
<i>how best to use such a weapon?</i>

1329
01:34:02,871 --> 01:34:06,466
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

1330
01:34:07,242 --> 01:34:09,142
<i>A man seemingly</i>
<i>without a conscience...</i>

1331
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:11,574
<i>... for whom the ends</i>
<i>always justify the means.</i>

1332
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:15,341
<i>He suggests that their target</i>
<i>should not be an enemy of the country...</i>

1333
01:34:15,517 --> 01:34:17,382
<i>... but rather, the country itself.</i>

1334
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:20,785
<i>Three targets are chosen</i>
<i>to maximize the effect of the attack:</i>

1335
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:23,947
<i>A school, a tube station</i>
<i>and a water-treatment plant.</i>

1336
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:26,719
<i>Several hundred die</i>
<i>within the first few weeks.</i>

1337
01:34:26,895 --> 01:34:29,227
Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.

1338
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:32,058
Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread.

1339
01:34:32,233 --> 01:34:34,224
- Sent destruction
through the Underground.

1340
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:38,264
<i>Fueled by the media,</i>
<i>fear and panic spread quickly...</i>

1341
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:43,672
<i>... fracturing and dividing the country until,</i>
<i>at last, the true goal comes into view.</i>

1342
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:45,278
Before the St. Mary's crises...

1343
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:49,644
...no one would have predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.

1344
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:54,277
<i>And then not long after the election,</i>
<i>lo and behold, a miracle.</i>

1345
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:56,980
<i>Some believed it was the work</i>
<i>of God himself.</i>

1346
01:34:57,158 --> 01:35:00,924
<i>But it was a pharmaceutical company</i>
<i>controlled by certain party members...</i>

1347
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:04,326
<i>... that made them all obscenely rich.</i>

1348
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:08,662
A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed...

1349
01:35:08,836 --> 01:35:12,135
...while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.

1350
01:35:13,174 --> 01:35:17,941
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.

1351
01:35:18,112 --> 01:35:20,444
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.

1352
01:35:20,615 --> 01:35:23,243
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed...

1353
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:27,377
...to the newly created position
of high chancellor.

1354
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:30,149
The rest, as they say, is history.

1355
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:36,222
- Can you prove any of this?
- Why do you think I'm still alive?

1356
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,736
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.

1357
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:44,769
I'm sure you would.

1358
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:49,842
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.

1359
01:35:50,011 --> 01:35:52,980
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.

1360
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:56,014
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing...

1361
01:35:56,184 --> 01:35:57,651
...l'll contact you again.

1362
01:35:57,819 --> 01:36:00,083
Till then, cheerio.

1363
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:03,087
Rookwood...

1364
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:06,590
...why didn't you come forward before?

1365
01:36:07,662 --> 01:36:09,027
What were you waiting for?

1366
01:36:09,197 --> 01:36:11,392
Well, for you, inspector.

1367
01:36:11,566 --> 01:36:13,363
I needed you.

1368
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,721
What's he doing in the dark there?

1369
01:36:42,897 --> 01:36:45,422
Creepy Creedy. Not sure I wanna know.

1370
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,195
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?

1371
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:51,531
And we both know why.

1372
01:36:52,206 --> 01:36:54,572
After I destroy Parliament...

1373
01:36:54,742 --> 01:36:58,644
...his only chance will be to offer them
someone else, some other piece of meat.

1374
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:00,041
And who will that be?

1375
01:37:00,281 --> 01:37:02,442
You, Mr. Creedy.

1376
01:37:02,617 --> 01:37:06,109
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.

1377
01:37:06,287 --> 01:37:10,087
A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.

1378
01:37:10,258 --> 01:37:13,421
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.

1379
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:16,085
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now...

1380
01:37:16,264 --> 01:37:19,062
...why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house...

1381
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:21,793
...and a tap on every phone.
- Bollocks.

1382
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:26,406
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.

1383
01:37:26,574 --> 01:37:29,566
- What do you want?
- Sutler.

1384
01:37:31,145 --> 01:37:33,739
Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.

1385
01:37:33,915 --> 01:37:35,906
You knew that one day
it'd be you or him.

1386
01:37:36,084 --> 01:37:39,417
That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.

1387
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:42,750
That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler...

1388
01:37:42,924 --> 01:37:46,724
...men that can be counted on.
All you have to do is say the word.

1389
01:37:46,894 --> 01:37:49,795
- What do I get out of this deal?
- Me.

1390
01:37:51,632 --> 01:37:54,795
If you accept,
put an X on your front door.

1391
01:37:56,938 --> 01:37:58,838
Why should I trust you?

1392
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,203
Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.

1393
01:38:10,118 --> 01:38:13,645
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego,</i>
<i>but your past that disarmed you.</i>

1394
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:16,855
<i>May we come up?</i>

1395
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:20,456
<i>You find your own tree.</i>

1396
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:34,370
We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.

1397
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:37,408
Still no word. What's he waiting for?

1398
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:43,015
Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.

1399
01:38:45,686 --> 01:38:47,654
- Yeah.
<i>- Is that Chief Inspector Finch?</i>

1400
01:38:47,822 --> 01:38:49,619
- It is.
<i>- This is Captain Clark...</i>

1401
01:38:49,791 --> 01:38:51,884
<i>... of the 137th Ward at Southend.</i>

1402
01:38:52,059 --> 01:38:53,287
<i>- We found him.</i>
- Found who?

1403
01:38:53,461 --> 01:38:55,520
<i>William Rookwood,</i>
<i>the one you're looking for.</i>

1404
01:38:55,696 --> 01:38:59,496
<i>I saw your report a couple weeks back,</i>
<i>thought I'd run it through our John Does.</i>

1405
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:01,567
<i>I hooked him. Perfect dental match.</i>

1406
01:39:01,736 --> 01:39:05,672
<i>A floater. Fishermen picked him up.</i>
<i>No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.</i>

1407
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:09,606
- William Rookwood is dead?
<i>- I'd say so. Twenty years now.</i>

1408
01:39:13,147 --> 01:39:14,341
Goddamn it!

1409
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:17,013
That son of a bitch sat there...

1410
01:39:17,185 --> 01:39:20,882
...and spoon-fed me that bullshit,
and I ate it up!

1411
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:23,723
So, what do we do now, inspector?

1412
01:39:23,891 --> 01:39:26,257
We do what we should have been doing.

1413
01:39:27,028 --> 01:39:28,359
We find him.

1414
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:52,985
<i>Every day, gentlemen.</i>

1415
01:39:53,154 --> 01:39:57,181
<i>Every day that brings us closer</i>
<i>to November...</i>

1416
01:39:57,358 --> 01:40:00,088
<i>... every day that man remains free...</i>

1417
01:40:00,461 --> 01:40:02,952
<i>... is one more failure.</i>

1418
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:05,564
<i>Three hundred and forty-seven days,</i>
<i>gentlemen.</i>

1419
01:40:05,733 --> 01:40:08,133
<i>Three hundred and forty-seven failures!</i>

1420
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:10,998
Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force...

1421
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:17,133
<i>We are being buried beneath the avalanche</i>
<i>of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!</i>

1422
01:40:34,629 --> 01:40:35,857
I'll get it.

1423
01:40:37,231 --> 01:40:39,529
- Eric Finch?
- Yeah.

1424
01:40:44,405 --> 01:40:45,633
Bloody hell.

1425
01:40:47,408 --> 01:40:49,035
How many went out?

1426
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:50,905
So far we count eight boxcars.

1427
01:40:51,078 --> 01:40:53,876
- Several hundred thousand, at least.
- Christ.

1428
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:59,510
<i>I want anyone caught</i>
<i>with one of those masks arrested!</i>

1429
01:40:59,687 --> 01:41:02,485
Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!

1430
01:41:02,657 --> 01:41:05,649
We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.

1431
01:41:06,394 --> 01:41:08,794
- This is exactly what he wants.
- What?

1432
01:41:08,963 --> 01:41:12,660
- Anarchy in the UK!
- Chaos.

1433
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:18,066
<i>Mr. Creedy, I am holding you</i>
<i>personally responsible for this situation.</i>

1434
01:41:20,508 --> 01:41:24,911
<i>The problem is that he knows us</i>
<i>better than we know ourselves.</i>

1435
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:29,810
That's why I went to Larkhill
last night.

1436
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:33,420
- That's outside quarantine.
- I had to see it.

1437
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:36,716
<i>There wasn't much left.</i>

1438
01:41:37,692 --> 01:41:40,855
<i>But when I was there, it was strange.</i>

1439
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:44,691
I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.

1440
01:41:50,371 --> 01:41:51,998
Like I could see the whole thing.

1441
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:57,209
<i>One long chain of events that stretched</i>
<i>all the way back before Larkhill.</i>

1442
01:41:59,246 --> 01:42:02,579
I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...

1443
01:42:08,723 --> 01:42:10,691
...and everything that
was going to happen.

1444
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:12,883
Hey, you!

1445
01:42:14,929 --> 01:42:19,229
It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...

1446
01:42:20,568 --> 01:42:23,059
...and I realized that
we were all a part of it...

1447
01:42:27,675 --> 01:42:29,472
...and all trapped by it.

1448
01:42:36,851 --> 01:42:38,716
So do you know what's gonna happen?

1449
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,580
No. It was a feeling.

1450
01:42:44,592 --> 01:42:46,219
But I can guess.

1451
01:42:48,195 --> 01:42:51,722
With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.

1452
01:42:56,037 --> 01:42:57,595
And when they do...

1453
01:42:57,772 --> 01:42:59,740
...things will turn nasty.

1454
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:16,050
<i>Rioters were arrested in Brixton.</i>

1455
01:43:16,257 --> 01:43:20,694
And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.

1456
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:29,200
At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.

1457
01:43:30,471 --> 01:43:31,802
And then...

1458
01:44:36,036 --> 01:44:38,664
Tonight's your big night.

1459
01:44:39,673 --> 01:44:41,368
You ready for it?

1460
01:44:43,644 --> 01:44:45,771
Are we ready for it?

1461
01:45:19,013 --> 01:45:20,640
I missed this song.

1462
01:45:21,549 --> 01:45:23,608
I didn't think you'd come.

1463
01:45:24,685 --> 01:45:26,118
I said I would.

1464
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:31,649
You look well.

1465
01:45:31,825 --> 01:45:33,258
Thank you.

1466
01:45:34,895 --> 01:45:39,423
May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?

1467
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,569
A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.

1468
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:48,107
I must confess, every time I heard a siren,
I worried about you.

1469
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:51,608
I worried about myself for a while.

1470
01:45:51,779 --> 01:45:54,543
But then, one day, I was at a market...

1471
01:45:54,715 --> 01:45:58,776
...and a friend, someone I had worked
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.

1472
01:45:59,954 --> 01:46:04,118
I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.

1473
01:46:05,392 --> 01:46:07,758
My friend picked it up...

1474
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:09,987
...and handed it to me.

1475
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:13,064
She looked at me right in the eyes...

1476
01:46:14,068 --> 01:46:15,933
...didn't recognize me.

1477
01:46:18,272 --> 01:46:21,332
Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.

1478
01:46:27,314 --> 01:46:29,839
I have a gift for you, Evey...

1479
01:46:30,017 --> 01:46:35,011
...but before I give it to you,
I'd like to ask you something.

1480
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:38,158
Would you dance with me?

1481
01:46:39,193 --> 01:46:42,685
Now? On the eve of your revolution?

1482
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:46,355
A revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.

1483
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:49,196
I'd love to.

1484
01:46:50,671 --> 01:46:53,799
<i>Tonight, I will speak directly</i>
<i>to these people...</i>

1485
01:46:53,974 --> 01:46:56,408
<i>... and make the situation</i>
<i>perfectly clear to them.</i>

1486
01:46:56,577 --> 01:47:02,140
<i>The security of this nation depends</i>
<i>on complete and total compliance.</i>

1487
01:47:02,316 --> 01:47:06,844
<i>Tonight, any protestor,</i>
<i>any instigator or agitator...</i>

1488
01:47:07,021 --> 01:47:09,751
<i>... will be made example of!</i>

1489
01:47:12,026 --> 01:47:14,995
Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.

1490
01:47:15,162 --> 01:47:16,993
<i>And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?</i>

1491
01:47:17,164 --> 01:47:19,359
- Should the terrorist succeed...
<i>- He won't.</i>

1492
01:47:19,533 --> 01:47:23,060
I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does...

1493
01:47:23,237 --> 01:47:27,003
<i>If he does, and something happens</i>
<i>to that building...</i>

1494
01:47:27,174 --> 01:47:30,439
<i>... the only thing that will change,</i>
<i>the only difference it will make...</i>

1495
01:47:30,611 --> 01:47:33,341
<i>... is that tomorrow morning,</i>
<i>instead of a newspaper...</i>

1496
01:47:33,514 --> 01:47:37,382
<i>... I will be reading</i>
<i>Mr. Creedy's resignation!</i>

1497
01:47:42,222 --> 01:47:46,352
You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.

1498
01:47:46,527 --> 01:47:50,588
I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.

1499
01:47:50,764 --> 01:47:52,459
It's nearly time.

1500
01:47:52,633 --> 01:47:55,295
The masks were ingenious.

1501
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:58,302
It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.

1502
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:01,566
Conceal me what I am,
and be my aid...

1503
01:48:01,742 --> 01:48:05,109
...for such disguise as haply shall become
the form of my intent.

1504
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:08,146
<i>- Twelfth Night</i>.
- Viola.

1505
01:48:08,315 --> 01:48:11,045
- I don't understand.
- What?

1506
01:48:11,218 --> 01:48:14,619
How you can be one of the most important
things that has happened to me...

1507
01:48:14,788 --> 01:48:17,222
...and yet I know
almost nothing about you.

1508
01:48:17,391 --> 01:48:20,189
I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were...

1509
01:48:20,361 --> 01:48:22,795
...if you had any brothers or sisters.

1510
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:26,091
I don't even know
what you really look like.

1511
01:48:26,266 --> 01:48:28,291
Evey, please.

1512
01:48:29,536 --> 01:48:31,731
There is a face beneath this mask...

1513
01:48:31,905 --> 01:48:33,736
...but it's not me.

1514
01:48:33,907 --> 01:48:37,274
I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it...

1515
01:48:37,444 --> 01:48:39,105
...or the bones beneath them.

1516
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:42,576
I understand.

1517
01:48:43,784 --> 01:48:45,376
Thank you.

1518
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:47,883
There isn't much time.

1519
01:48:48,055 --> 01:48:50,250
I have something I must give you.

1520
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:52,583
I went by Parliament.

1521
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:57,595
Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.

1522
01:48:58,465 --> 01:49:01,400
Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.

1523
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:05,998
But if they do,
what do you think will happen?

1524
01:49:06,774 --> 01:49:09,334
What usually happens
when people without guns...

1525
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:12,206
...stand up to people with guns.

1526
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:14,504
Pull over here.

1527
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:18,173
We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?

1528
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:22,987
Inspector.

1529
01:49:23,791 --> 01:49:25,656
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?

1530
01:49:34,468 --> 01:49:38,268
The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.

1531
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:39,667
They did.

1532
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,640
It took nearly 10 years to clear the tracks
and lay a bit of my own.

1533
01:49:45,612 --> 01:49:47,136
Let me show you.

1534
01:50:03,297 --> 01:50:05,162
These tracks lead to Parliament.

1535
01:50:05,466 --> 01:50:06,865
Yes.

1536
01:50:07,568 --> 01:50:09,559
Then it's really going to happen, isn't it?

1537
01:50:09,736 --> 01:50:13,035
It will if you want it to.

1538
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:15,667
- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.

1539
01:50:16,243 --> 01:50:21,704
Everything that I have: My home,
my books, the gallery, this train...

1540
01:50:21,882 --> 01:50:24,851
...l'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.

1541
01:50:25,018 --> 01:50:26,417
Is this another trick, V?

1542
01:50:26,587 --> 01:50:30,956
No. No more tricks. No more lies.

1543
01:50:31,124 --> 01:50:33,024
Only truth.

1544
01:50:33,193 --> 01:50:36,356
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong...

1545
01:50:36,864 --> 01:50:41,767
...that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.

1546
01:50:41,935 --> 01:50:44,733
- Why?
- Because this world...

1547
01:50:44,905 --> 01:50:49,365
...the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.

1548
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:52,435
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin...

1549
01:50:52,613 --> 01:50:57,710
...that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.

1550
01:51:00,721 --> 01:51:02,655
Where are you going?

1551
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:05,222
The time has come for me
to meet my maker...

1552
01:51:05,392 --> 01:51:08,725
...and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.

1553
01:51:08,896 --> 01:51:11,660
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.

1554
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:14,392
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.

1555
01:51:14,568 --> 01:51:17,537
No. You were right about what I am.

1556
01:51:17,971 --> 01:51:19,962
I have no tree waiting for me.

1557
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:24,934
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.

1558
01:51:25,112 --> 01:51:26,875
That's not true.

1559
01:51:53,473 --> 01:51:54,838
I can't.

1560
01:52:03,884 --> 01:52:05,545
<i>My fellow Englishmen...</i>

1561
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:08,110
<i>... tonight, our country...</i>

1562
01:52:08,288 --> 01:52:09,812
<i>... that which we stand for...</i>

1563
01:52:10,023 --> 01:52:11,615
<i>... and all that we hold dear...</i>

1564
01:52:11,792 --> 01:52:15,558
<i>... faces a grave and terrible threat.</i>

1565
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:17,196
The area's clean, sir.

1566
01:52:17,798 --> 01:52:21,564
<i>This violent and unparalleled assault</i>
<i>to our security...</i>

1567
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:23,498
<i>... will not go undefended.</i>

1568
01:52:23,670 --> 01:52:24,967
Where is he?

1569
01:52:25,138 --> 01:52:26,127
<i>Or unpunished.</i>

1570
01:52:26,306 --> 01:52:28,467
Penny for the Guy.

1571
01:52:28,642 --> 01:52:32,635
<i>Our enemy is an insidious one,</i>
<i>seeking to divide us...</i>

1572
01:52:33,246 --> 01:52:37,683
<i>... and destroy the very foundation</i>
<i>of our great nation.</i>

1573
01:52:37,851 --> 01:52:41,912
I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?

1574
01:52:42,089 --> 01:52:43,249
Bring him down.

1575
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:45,653
<i>Tonight we must remain steadfast.</i>

1576
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:47,990
<i>We must remain determined.</i>

1577
01:52:48,161 --> 01:52:51,358
<i>But most of all,</i>
<i>we must remain united.</i>

1578
01:52:54,635 --> 01:52:58,264
<i>Those caught tonight</i>
<i>in violation of curfew...</i>

1579
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:01,066
<i>... will be considered in league</i>
<i>with our enemy...</i>

1580
01:53:01,241 --> 01:53:04,506
<i>... and prosecuted as a terrorist</i>
<i>without leniency or exception.</i>

1581
01:53:04,678 --> 01:53:06,168
I want to see his face.

1582
01:53:06,346 --> 01:53:09,804
<i>Tonight I give you</i>
<i>my most solemn vow...</i>

1583
01:53:09,983 --> 01:53:12,383
<i>... that justice will be swift...</i>

1584
01:53:12,552 --> 01:53:15,020
<i>... it will be righteous...</i>

1585
01:53:15,188 --> 01:53:17,452
<i>... and it will be without mercy.</i>

1586
01:53:19,593 --> 01:53:21,788
Oh, God. No.

1587
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:25,864
At last, we finally meet.

1588
01:53:28,402 --> 01:53:30,768
I have something for you, chancellor.

1589
01:53:31,038 --> 01:53:32,835
A farewell gift.

1590
01:53:33,006 --> 01:53:36,601
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done...

1591
01:53:36,777 --> 01:53:38,802
...and for the only thing you have left.

1592
01:53:41,148 --> 01:53:43,082
Goodbye, chancellor.

1593
01:53:44,084 --> 01:53:45,278
Mr. Creedy.

1594
01:53:47,654 --> 01:53:49,417
Disgusting.

1595
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:04,329
Now that's done with...

1596
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:08,338
...it's time to have a look at your face.

1597
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:10,399
Take off your mask.

1598
01:54:10,711 --> 01:54:11,939
No.

1599
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:28,987
Defiant to the end, huh?

1600
01:54:30,964 --> 01:54:34,559
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.

1601
01:54:34,735 --> 01:54:35,861
You're like me.

1602
01:54:36,036 --> 01:54:40,473
The only thing you and I have in common,
Mr. Creedy, is we're both about to die.

1603
01:54:42,109 --> 01:54:43,872
How do you imagine
that's gonna happen?

1604
01:54:44,144 --> 01:54:46,339
With my hands around your neck.

1605
01:54:48,615 --> 01:54:49,741
Bollocks.

1606
01:54:50,851 --> 01:54:53,081
What are you gonna do, huh?

1607
01:54:53,253 --> 01:54:55,346
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.

1608
01:54:55,522 --> 01:54:59,925
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.

1609
01:55:00,093 --> 01:55:01,651
We have guns.

1610
01:55:01,828 --> 01:55:05,093
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty...

1611
01:55:05,265 --> 01:55:07,392
...l'm no longer standing,
because if I am...

1612
01:55:08,201 --> 01:55:10,328
...you'll all be dead
before you've reloaded.

1613
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:12,831
That's impossible!

1614
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:16,300
Kill him.

1615
01:55:40,967 --> 01:55:42,059
My turn.

1616
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:55,935
Die! Die!

1617
01:56:56,843 --> 01:56:59,004
Why won't you die?!

1618
01:56:59,946 --> 01:57:01,311
Why won't you die?

1619
01:57:03,183 --> 01:57:06,277
Beneath this mask
there is more than flesh.

1620
01:57:06,453 --> 01:57:09,251
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.

1621
01:57:10,624 --> 01:57:12,819
And ideas are bulletproof.

1622
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:07,638
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.

1623
01:58:07,814 --> 01:58:09,076
This is General Ackroyd.

1624
01:58:09,516 --> 01:58:11,040
Keep communication tight.

1625
01:58:11,217 --> 01:58:14,482
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.

1626
01:58:18,391 --> 01:58:19,722
V!

1627
01:58:24,364 --> 01:58:26,889
Oh, God, we have to stop your bleeding.

1628
01:58:27,067 --> 01:58:31,197
Please, don't. I'm finished and glad of it.

1629
01:58:31,604 --> 01:58:33,196
Don't say that.

1630
01:58:33,707 --> 01:58:36,574
I told you, only truth.

1631
01:58:40,113 --> 01:58:43,549
For 20 years I sought only this day.

1632
01:58:43,717 --> 01:58:45,844
Nothing else existed...

1633
01:58:47,921 --> 01:58:49,912
...until I saw you.

1634
01:58:51,091 --> 01:58:53,355
Then everything changed.

1635
01:58:54,761 --> 01:58:56,695
I fell in love with you, Evey...

1636
01:58:58,264 --> 01:59:01,461
...like I no longer believed I could.

1637
01:59:01,634 --> 01:59:04,102
V, I don't want you to die.

1638
01:59:06,873 --> 01:59:10,639
That's the most beautiful thing...

1639
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:13,404
...you could have ever given me.

1640
01:59:20,954 --> 01:59:22,421
V?

1641
01:59:23,656 --> 01:59:24,918
V?!

1642
01:59:35,368 --> 01:59:38,337
Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading to Trafalgar Square.

1643
01:59:38,505 --> 01:59:40,530
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.

1644
02:00:12,772 --> 02:00:14,865
Hold it. Stop right there.

1645
02:00:18,278 --> 02:00:19,768
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?

1646
02:00:27,787 --> 02:00:29,049
Then it's over?

1647
02:00:29,522 --> 02:00:30,750
Almost.

1648
02:00:30,924 --> 02:00:33,358
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.

1649
02:00:35,728 --> 02:00:36,786
No.

1650
02:00:37,597 --> 02:00:39,963
Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.

1651
02:00:40,133 --> 02:00:42,363
- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.

1652
02:00:43,803 --> 02:00:46,135
Or from Party Leader Creedy.

1653
02:00:46,306 --> 02:00:47,603
Or from the high chancellor.

1654
02:00:48,508 --> 02:00:49,736
Why are you doing this?

1655
02:00:50,276 --> 02:00:52,642
- Because he was right.
- About what?

1656
02:00:52,812 --> 02:00:57,306
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.

1657
02:01:02,355 --> 02:01:04,846
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!

1658
02:01:31,651 --> 02:01:34,051
Jesus bloody Christ.

1659
02:01:59,345 --> 02:02:00,437
It's time.

1660
02:02:21,834 --> 02:02:23,131
Tell me...

1661
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:26,661
...do you like music, Mr. Finch?

1662
02:02:46,259 --> 02:02:48,250
That music?

1663
02:02:48,761 --> 02:02:50,194
Yes.

1664
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:52,188
His music.

1665
02:03:24,130 --> 02:03:25,688
Who was he?

1666
02:03:26,966 --> 02:03:28,194
He was Edmond Dantes.

1667
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:32,770
And he was my father...

1668
02:03:32,939 --> 02:03:34,873
...and my mother.

1669
02:03:35,775 --> 02:03:37,208
My brother.

1670
02:03:39,212 --> 02:03:41,077
My friend.

1671
02:03:42,015 --> 02:03:44,006
He was you...

1672
02:03:46,085 --> 02:03:47,552
...and me.

1673
02:03:49,656 --> 02:03:51,521
He was all of us.

1674
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:23,420
<i>No one will ever forget that night...</i>

1675
02:04:23,589 --> 02:04:26,251
<i>... and what it meant for this country.</i>

1676
02:04:26,759 --> 02:04:29,193
<i>But I will never forget the man...</i>

1677
02:04:29,362 --> 02:04:31,023
<i>... and what he meant to me.</i>

1678
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:30,331
