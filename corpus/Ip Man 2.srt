1
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:26,906
Brother Man, we're here

2
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,859
I'm sorry to be such a bother

3
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:31,799
Don't mention it

4
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:37,132
This place has been idle for a few months.
I've informed the owners, they are nice folks

5
00:02:37,793 --> 00:02:41,010
Thank you

6
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,773
Is this suitable for your school?

7
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,632
Wow, this place is huge!

8
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:52,734
Is this ok?

9
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:53,657
Yes, yes

10
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:58,226
Very spacious...

11
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:13,477
Master Yip

12
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:16,802
You haven't gotten any disciples yet?

13
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,247
What's up, 3rd Aunt?

14
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,019
You have such a big place here.
I'd like to hang my laundry here

15
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:27,746
Sure, no problem

16
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:13,582
Yong

17
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,978
Sigh, I told you before... let me do this

18
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:21,605
I don't know what to do with you

19
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:24,482
There'll be no more water left by the time you come

20
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,865
Then I'll come back earlier 
next time. Let me do these chores

21
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,660
I've told you not to exert yourself

22
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:36,799
How are you feeling?

23
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:41,300
Mama, I need to pay school fees

24
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:44,279
Ok, hang on

25
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,842
Who's that?

26
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:53,449
Pay your rent! Mr and Mrs Yip!

27
00:04:53,722 --> 00:04:57,366
Don't open the door. We don't have enough money for rent

28
00:04:57,486 --> 00:05:00,004
Mr and Mrs Yip! Pay your rent

29
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:41,941
Master Yip, still no students?

30
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:45,812
I'll go hang my laundry...

31
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:50,466
Let me help you...

32
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:57,413
Thank you very much!

33
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:23,458
Hey, are you the one teaching Wing Chun?

34
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:29,523
Master Yip! Someone's here to learn kung fu!

35
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,354
You wish to learn Wing Chun?

36
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:38,021
I don't even know what Wing Chun is

37
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:42,287
Then let me tell you. Wing Chun is the Southern art of close combat....

38
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:49,569
Enough! Spar with me. If I lose, I'll be your student

39
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:52,848
Fine

40
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:09,279
Wing Chun. Yip Man

41
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,899
So, what do you think?

42
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:30,496
You haven't won yet

43
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,293
Do you yield?

44
00:07:57,413 --> 00:08:02,053
Yield? I don't even know what you're doing

45
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:14,958
Do you know now?

46
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:28,320
Master Yip, I didn't know
you're so skilful! Fantastic!

47
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,560
Hey, young man! You should be his disciple!

48
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,333
I think you can start paying tuition fees now

49
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:46,337
Hey! How can you leave like that?

50
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:56,955
Master Yip, what now? Your potential student is gone

51
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,255
That's him

52
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,323
How good can his kung fu be?

53
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:19,416
Would I lie to you?

54
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:22,060
He looks like he couldn't even hurt a fly

55
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:24,906
If you hadn't told me, I'd have 
thought he's just a laundryman

56
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:31,733
You're not really here to learn kung fu. Please leave

57
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,952
Ok, then we'll fight you

58
00:09:36,364 --> 00:09:37,901
No need to take them off

59
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:39,558
Why not?

60
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,439
Oh, nevermind

61
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:44,682
The Yip Man Palm

62
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:10,482
Told you not to take off your shirts...

63
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:15,880
Master! I am Huang Liang, please take me as a disciple!

64
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:29,808
- Master, I am Xiu Shi Chang!
- Wei Guo Jian
- Wang Kun

65
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,606
Please accept us as students!

66
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:36,207
Eh, I asked first. You must address
me as "Eldest Brother"

67
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:37,829
Serve tea to Master!

68
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:40,332
No need to trouble yourselves

69
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:45,092
Pay tuition fees first

70
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,610
In Wing Chun, we attack and defend in one motion

71
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,410
Attack, and defend

72
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,501
To disable an opponent in the shortest time

73
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:01,194
This is block and attack

74
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,099
Block and attack

75
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,678
Follow up with a dozen quick punches

76
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:09,061
Understand?

77
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:10,372
(Blank looks)

78
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:15,728
Who is Master Yip?

79
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:20,081
Master!

80
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:24,844
Liang, did you ask them to come?

81
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:49,987
Master, do you think you can fight off 10 men?

82
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:55,666
The best thing is not to fight at all

83
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:57,077
Continue training

84
00:11:57,197 --> 00:12:01,275
What if they use weapons?

85
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:03,674
Run

86
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:11,259
Time to collect tuition fees

87
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:12,635
Ok

88
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:17,221
You always say that

89
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,655
I will collect soon

90
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:22,280
Hang on a sec

91
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,585
What's up?

92
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:29,018
It's time to pay tuition fees

93
00:12:29,138 --> 00:12:30,570
What's happening?

94
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,828
Time to pay tuition fees

95
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,650
If you have the money, please pay up

96
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,661
Here you go Master

97
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:44,646
Master, I can only pay $2... My mother...
she needs the money. I'll pay the rest later

98
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:50,360
Pay next time... next time

99
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,325
Go home for dinner

100
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,764
Bye Master

101
00:12:57,087 --> 00:13:00,545
It's so little... what shall we do?

102
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:05,801
No choice. You also know things aren't so good now

103
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:10,528
The students asked for help, I can't refuse

104
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:13,350
Then we need to appeal to the landlady

105
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:19,947
Yes, things will work out eventually

106
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:23,545
2 pieces of cake please

107
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:28,011
- You want the egg tarts?
- No, thanks

108
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:32,279
Stop! Hold it right there!

109
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,265
Thief! Return it to me!

110
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:40,005
Please don't beat up my dad

111
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,968
No money? Then we'll get him

112
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,884
Please let him go!

113
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:50,623
Stop, stop! Don't beat him up

114
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:51,893
What's happening?

115
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:53,516
He stole our roasted duck

116
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:54,786
I'll pay for him

117
00:13:54,906 --> 00:13:55,527
Give it here!

118
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,513
Let's go

119
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:00,099
Jin Quan?

120
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:02,194
Uncle Man, I know where Dad is

121
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:03,761
Bring me to him

122
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:15,953
Here

123
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:31,610
Jin Quan!

124
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,926
Uncle Man, he doesn't recognise anyone

125
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:39,441
The Japanese shot him in the head once. He doesn't recognise anyone anymore

126
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:54,364
Jin Quan, I'm Yip

127
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,654
Jin Quan!

128
00:14:56,774 --> 00:15:01,607
Get away! Get out! Go! Go!

129
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:27,535
Let's go, Uncle Man

130
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:36,411
It's my fault. I did this to you

131
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,137
Let's go

132
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:52,321
My dad hasn't chased me away yet
That's why I'm still here

133
00:15:53,944 --> 00:16:01,246
On good days I can get odd jobs and buy food back

134
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:05,675
On bad days, we starve

135
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:13,603
Don't worry, Kwan

136
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:17,669
I'll help you take care of him

137
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:20,880
Since you are recommended by
Master Yip, I'll definitely hire you

138
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,254
Kid, if you agree to half salary, you can start now

139
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:26,136
No problem

140
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:29,134
Have a seat. I'll arrange work for you

141
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,938
Brother Man, don't leave. I'll treat you to tea

142
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:33,208
Thank you

143
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:34,160
Don't mention it

144
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,677
Have a seat

145
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:37,759
This is good

146
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,311
Thank you Uncle Man

147
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,521
Kwan, you must work hard

148
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:43,932
I will

149
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:56,279
What do you think? I can bring you there later

150
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,948
I'm from Hong School. I don't need to learn from you!

151
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:08,204
Since you aren't interested, why tear my posters down?

152
00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:13,637
I don't care what you learn. You're blocking my poster

153
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:19,881
Want to know what Wing Chun is?

154
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,468
You're looking for trouble?

155
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:29,899
We won't bully you

156
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,981
One on one. No helping!

157
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:32,531
Ok

158
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,274
Also, don't poke eyes

159
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:36,648
Enough talk. I'm in a hurry

160
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:26,448
So you yield?

161
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:27,315
No!

162
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:28,082
No?

163
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:29,798
Do you yield?

164
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:40,182
When you strike, don't move from this line

165
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:42,045
Relax

166
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:43,819
Relax more

167
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,862
Who is Yip Man?

168
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:52,010
Yes?

169
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,139
Your disciple Liang has beaten up our brother

170
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,245
We took him hostage. Bring money to rescue him at the fish market

171
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:00,795
Let's go

172
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,041
Brother Jin

173
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:43,999
Are you his Master?

174
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,377
That's right

175
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:53,113
I believe it's just a misunderstanding

176
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:54,814
Let's talk it over

177
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:57,846
Can you release my disciple?

178
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:58,654
Release him!

179
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,177
Are you all right?

180
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:14,283
I'm fine

181
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:16,543
Why did you beat him up?

182
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:19,868
We sparred and he lost. It's not my fault

183
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,651
What? I can't beat you?

184
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:23,286
Don't be rash

185
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:25,879
You're all young men

186
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:29,640
Sometimes you get minor injuries during sparring

187
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,430
Next time I'll come specially to
clarify things with your Master

188
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,009
May I know who your Master is?

189
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:39,373
You don't need to know who he is.
He's better than you

190
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:42,444
Enough talk. Did you bring the money?

191
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,138
No

192
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:50,138
Don't be rash

193
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,438
Attack!

194
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:02,539
Behind you!

195
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:19,789
Chop him up!

196
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:13,319
Master!

197
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:12,055
Liang!

198
00:24:12,715 --> 00:24:14,208
Master! I'm here

199
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:29,937
Master, you really can beat up more than 10 men!

200
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:33,152
Only if we can escape

201
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:43,377
Stay close to me

202
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,433
Follow me!

203
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:27,097
Go, Liang

204
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:28,762
Go!

205
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:36,609
Jin Shan Zhao?

206
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:50,825
Nobody move!

207
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:54,094
What are you doing?

208
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:01,759
Master Yip, you are free to go

209
00:26:09,842 --> 00:26:10,877
Thanks

210
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,299
You're asking for it!

211
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,650
Break it up!

212
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:28,501
Master!

213
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:34,736
You stirring up trouble again?

214
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:36,394
No, Master

215
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,052
I was sparring with him, but he brought
his Master here to intimidate us

216
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:44,256
Ji

217
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:47,278
You trying to be Big Brother here?

218
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:48,336
No of course not

219
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,970
Big Brother Hong, let's talk things over

220
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:54,970
You want to talk with a knife in your hand?

221
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:56,028
No, no

222
00:26:56,522 --> 00:27:00,532
That son of a bitch tried to cause
trouble on my turf. That's why I was....

223
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:02,756
This isn't your turf

224
00:27:02,876 --> 00:27:09,756
This is my road. Your patch of ground is mine.
So you tell me, whose turf is this?

225
00:27:12,604 --> 00:27:14,607
It's yours, of course

226
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:17,914
You can leave now. It's not your concern

227
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,224
Which style and school are you?

228
00:27:35,699 --> 00:27:39,989
Greetings Master Hong. I'm Yip Man
of the Wing Chun sect from Fo Shan

229
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:45,264
The situation is like this. My disciple sparred with yours

230
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:49,127
My disciple definitely went too far and injured your disciple

231
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,478
You're saying my Hong style is inferior?

232
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:53,546
I didn't mean it like that

233
00:27:54,228 --> 00:27:56,955
Who allowed you to teach martial arts? Do you know the rules?

234
00:27:57,296 --> 00:27:58,588
I don't know of any rules

235
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:01,581
Ok I'll tell you the rules now

236
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:04,998
You must accept challenges from the various schools

237
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:09,516
If you win, then you are fit to teach martial arts

238
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:17,628
So now you know the rules for opening a martial arts school

239
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:31,448
Enough talk. There are rules for martial
arts schools, and then there are rules of Law

240
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:33,322
Now that you're done

241
00:28:33,442 --> 00:28:36,407
Wan, Po! Take these 2 into custody

242
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:38,199
I have a spare set of handcuffs. Arrest him too

243
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,154
Huh? Me too?

244
00:28:39,274 --> 00:28:39,845
Master!

245
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:41,520
Stop squirming! Let's go

246
00:28:43,706 --> 00:28:45,205
Move it

247
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:50,215
Settle your affairs, and let's go in. The Chief is waiting

248
00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:00,225
Sir

249
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:33,921
The Chief is asking about the manpower and security arrangements

250
00:29:35,002 --> 00:29:36,750
Everything is arranged. No problems

251
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:42,462
So how much will I get for the competition?

252
00:29:45,855 --> 00:29:48,334
Please excuse us a moment

253
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,683
Don't worry, I'll take care of it

254
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:05,147
So how much is his cut? You
tell me, I'll tell Master Hong

255
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:20,261
Speak!

256
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:21,589
Are you going to tell me?

257
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:24,868
Don't worry. These cops are just strutting around acting tough

258
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:28,029
It'll be ok once we make bail

259
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:34,599
Master Jin, I'm sorry to get you involved

260
00:30:36,174 --> 00:30:37,894
I'm sorry to get you involved today

261
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:38,564
Hang on a bit

262
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,608
I'm deaf in this ear after you wacked me there the other time

263
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:42,325
So what were you saying?

264
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:45,934
I said, I'm sorry to get you involved today

265
00:30:46,297 --> 00:30:47,167
It's nothing

266
00:30:47,484 --> 00:30:52,702
If it weren't for your wake up call the other time
I don't know what I'll do here in Hong Kong

267
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:57,968
Open up, Police!

268
00:30:59,077 --> 00:31:00,970
Open up!

269
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:04,014
What's wrong?

270
00:31:04,134 --> 00:31:05,353
Any of Yip Man's relatives here?

271
00:31:05,473 --> 00:31:06,481
I'm his wife

272
00:31:07,057 --> 00:31:09,889
Your husband is arrested for fighting

273
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,911
Bring money to bail him out

274
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,033
Mr Liang! Mr Liang!

275
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:25,348
Mr Liang!

276
00:31:25,724 --> 00:31:26,770
What's wrong, Mrs Yip?

277
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:32,472
Please save my husband! I don't
have enough money for bail

278
00:31:34,423 --> 00:31:36,492
Wait here

279
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:40,321
It's very troublesome to open
a martial arts school here in Hong Kong

280
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,872
There's too many schools, too many masters

281
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:44,294
Too many rules too

282
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:47,009
And that Master Hong has many supporters

283
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:48,872
Many disciples, and a lot of money

284
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:54,949
So what? I'll get him once I'm out of here

285
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:59,333
I'll destroy his fish stall and poison all his fish!

286
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:04,446
What's the difference between you and them, then?

287
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:09,405
Hey kid, you fight pretty good

288
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:12,038
I'm not a kid!

289
00:32:12,255 --> 00:32:13,500
Which part of me looks like a kid?

290
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:15,586
Liang! Don't use that tone

291
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,949
Master Jin is your elder

292
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:18,818
It's all right, he's young

293
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:23,116
He reminds me of myself when I was young

294
00:32:23,445 --> 00:32:26,019
If you want him to turn out well, get him a wife

295
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:31,357
Just like me... wife, kids, family. It changes a man

296
00:32:38,734 --> 00:32:40,521
I want to post bail for my husband

297
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:41,931
What's his name?

298
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:43,013
Yip Man

299
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:45,481
Did you bring the money?

300
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:46,668
Yes, here

301
00:32:48,526 --> 00:32:52,451
Yip Man, you're free to go

302
00:32:57,805 --> 00:32:59,239
Hurry up

303
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,387
I'm here to bail Jin out

304
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:20,856
Wife!

305
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:23,395
Brother, please open the door

306
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:25,370
Quickly!

307
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,219
That's my wife

308
00:33:37,544 --> 00:33:41,916
Liang, is anyone coming for you?

309
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:44,490
No

310
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:55,688
Don't worry Master. They'll release
me in a couple of days

311
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:57,462
You go on

312
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:00,916
I won't be able to see you out

313
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:16,040
Brother Geng, I need to impose on you again

314
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:18,449
I want to bail my disciple out

315
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:21,227
Is it ok?

316
00:34:23,131 --> 00:34:25,658
Brother Man, I didn't bring enough money

317
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:27,048
Master Yip

318
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:30,351
Master Yip, wait a bit

319
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:33,277
Wife, do you have any money?

320
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:34,876
What do you need it for?

321
00:34:35,593 --> 00:34:36,885
It's an emergency

322
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,318
You're always like this. No money!

323
00:34:39,883 --> 00:34:42,163
Help people out here, Wife

324
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,137
This is the last time

325
00:34:45,572 --> 00:34:47,217
Mum's the best!

326
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:50,196
Master Yip, here's the money

327
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,433
I'll return it to you as soon as I can. Thank you

328
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:54,185
No problem, don't mention it

329
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:10,243
It's so difficult to open a school here.
Why don't you just give up?

330
00:35:16,673 --> 00:35:21,410
I'll just have to go visit the other masters. It's nothing

331
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:26,045
I don't want to worry every day like before

332
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:40,615
We made it through the war,
there's nothing to worry about

333
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:49,265
Don't dwell on it. Go to sleep

334
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,477
I've fought this type of matches many times before

335
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:12,391
They were blades below then, not stools

336
00:36:12,775 --> 00:36:15,960
Have you heard of this Yip Man before?

337
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,686
The name means nothing to me. No

338
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:24,032
I'm sure he's no match for you, Master Luo

339
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:25,572
Likewise, Master Zhang

340
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:28,604
Will you be going up there?

341
00:36:28,724 --> 00:36:30,238
I'll go if you go

342
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,882
Enough talk. Let's drink tea

343
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,404
Cheers

344
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:41,286
Master

345
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:48,391
He's here

346
00:36:54,573 --> 00:36:55,949
Fellow Masters

347
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,937
This is Yip Man

348
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:02,510
He wants to establish his sect here in Hong Kong

349
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:06,765
That's why he's here today to accept your challenges

350
00:37:07,835 --> 00:37:08,611
Yip Man

351
00:37:09,856 --> 00:37:11,549
If you surrender, you lose

352
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:13,570
If you leave the table, you lose

353
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,276
If you're the last man standing on
the table after all the challenges

354
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,932
I'll greet you as "Master Yip"

355
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:22,943
If there are no questions, we can begin

356
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,672
What, he's just going to walk up to the table?

357
00:37:40,753 --> 00:37:44,114
He's not supposed to touch the ground

358
00:37:57,272 --> 00:37:59,911
Greetings fellow masters. I am Yip Man

359
00:38:00,522 --> 00:38:03,483
I'm from Wing Chun sect from Fo Shan

360
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:06,022
I hope my fellow masters will
go easy on me

361
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:08,245
Which master will have a go?

362
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:11,759
Master Luo, aren't you going?

363
00:38:12,864 --> 00:38:15,851
I'll wait and see if anyone else is going first

364
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:27,977
Fine then, I'll be the first

365
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,241
Please

366
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:49,840
Please

367
00:38:53,053 --> 00:38:54,787
Lightning Kick

368
00:38:54,788 --> 00:38:55,810
Beware, brother

369
00:39:45,247 --> 00:39:47,339
Are you all right Master Luo?

370
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:48,491
I'm fine!

371
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,825
He'd be dead if it were blades below

372
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:54,859
This is too much

373
00:39:55,846 --> 00:39:57,926
The table is really slippery!

374
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:00,841
Thank you for going easy

375
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:03,079
Come on, don't let him stop

376
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:06,393
Master Zhang, your turn

377
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:11,801
Master Zhang, go on... go on

378
00:40:19,763 --> 00:40:23,854
Master Zhang, the table is really very slippery

379
00:40:31,986 --> 00:40:32,633
Please

380
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:35,242
Please

381
00:41:47,557 --> 00:41:48,873
I yield!

382
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:00,071
Thank you for showing mercy

383
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:01,729
Thank you for going easy on me

384
00:42:03,194 --> 00:42:05,545
Any other masters want to have a go?

385
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:54,539
Please

386
00:42:56,192 --> 00:42:56,669
Please

387
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,059
Master Yip

388
00:44:55,553 --> 00:44:56,584
Master Hong

389
00:44:58,871 --> 00:45:04,027
To join this association, you must pay a monthly fee

390
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:05,506
What fees?

391
00:45:05,626 --> 00:45:10,035
It's the rules. Everyone pays $100 a month

392
00:45:10,155 --> 00:45:12,187
Pay and you'll have no trouble

393
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:23,844
If there's any masters that still think
I'm not worthy, I'm game anytime

394
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:30,029
But I won't fulfil your personal financial 
interests by paying this "fee"

395
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:35,947
As you wish. Don't look for me
if you're in trouble next time

396
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:39,265
You may go now

397
00:45:52,806 --> 00:45:53,703
Medication

398
00:46:00,832 --> 00:46:03,746
Master, here's the medication

399
00:46:14,736 --> 00:46:17,748
Are you insane? Drawing these on my newspaper?

400
00:46:17,868 --> 00:46:20,745
I just wanted readers to understand the content

401
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:22,229
Is the feedback that bad?

402
00:46:24,212 --> 00:46:27,650
Everyone in Hong Kong now wants to learn Wing Chun!

403
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:28,523
This is fantastic!

404
00:46:28,643 --> 00:46:32,270
Continue the drawings. I'm counting on you

405
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:33,695
Get back to work!

406
00:46:34,326 --> 00:46:36,824
Well done! Good job!

407
00:46:40,151 --> 00:46:44,558
(Wing Chun fights Hong Style to a stalemate)

408
00:46:48,694 --> 00:46:51,456
Mei, stop doing your homework. Eat

409
00:46:51,941 --> 00:46:52,719
Eat first, ok?

410
00:46:53,048 --> 00:46:54,797
Wife, more porridge please

411
00:46:56,809 --> 00:47:00,747
You've not been eating well lately. Eat more

412
00:47:03,476 --> 00:47:04,449
Where are you going?

413
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:08,012
You blind? I'm going up to do my laundry

414
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:10,200
Are you really just doing your laundry?

415
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:14,122
What do you think this big basin
is for? Washing my head?

416
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,267
151.... 152...

417
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:17,370
Where are you headed?

418
00:47:17,387 --> 00:47:18,539
To learn Wing Chun

419
00:47:18,786 --> 00:47:21,042
Wing Chun? It's not here

420
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:22,471
The newspapers say it's here

421
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:23,963
No it's not. Go away!

422
00:47:23,987 --> 00:47:25,092
You're better off learning Hong style

423
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,396
Hey!

424
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:30,005
You bunch of rascals are preventing
people from learning Wing Chun!

425
00:47:30,028 --> 00:47:31,171
You son of a bitch!

426
00:47:31,194 --> 00:47:32,111
Come down!

427
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:34,168
What are you doing?

428
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:35,558
You deaf?

429
00:47:35,678 --> 00:47:36,886
Come down!

430
00:47:38,026 --> 00:47:39,589
What? No, you come up

431
00:47:39,612 --> 00:47:40,917
Come down if you have the guts

432
00:47:49,555 --> 00:47:50,951
Come down if you dare!

433
00:47:50,974 --> 00:47:52,702
You're crazy! So unbecoming!

434
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,229
Look, Wing Chun disciples!

435
00:47:55,603 --> 00:47:56,508
Attack!

436
00:48:00,856 --> 00:48:01,526
They're coming down

437
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:01,961
Hurry

438
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:07,941
Come out!

439
00:48:52,194 --> 00:48:54,874
The owners are thinking twice after what happened today

440
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:55,696
I understand

441
00:48:55,816 --> 00:48:58,388
They've decided not to lend this rooftop to you anymore

442
00:48:58,508 --> 00:49:00,045
I understand. I'm sorry

443
00:49:00,492 --> 00:49:02,560
I'm sorry too. I'll be going now

444
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:07,912
Goodbye

445
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:09,416
Bye, Brother Geng

446
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:44,565
Master...

447
00:49:49,328 --> 00:49:51,021
I'm sure you know by now

448
00:49:54,476 --> 00:49:56,498
We can't train here anymore

449
00:49:57,148 --> 00:50:00,157
Master, it's not our fault! They started it!

450
00:50:00,392 --> 00:50:02,449
Yes they started it

451
00:50:02,802 --> 00:50:04,040
Let's go look for them to settle this

452
00:50:08,389 --> 00:50:09,717
Pack this place up before you go

453
00:50:10,581 --> 00:50:11,979
Bring the wooden men to my house

454
00:50:12,379 --> 00:50:15,223
Master...

455
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,206
Ji

456
00:50:34,307 --> 00:50:37,774
Give these to the disciples. They've earned it

457
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:38,962
Thank you Master

458
00:50:42,811 --> 00:50:44,515
- Here's yours.
- Thanks

459
00:50:44,635 --> 00:50:46,175
Good work everyone

460
00:50:47,968 --> 00:50:50,274
You still dare to show up here?

461
00:50:56,851 --> 00:50:58,320
I'm here to see your Master

462
00:50:58,801 --> 00:51:02,386
Ji... you may all retire

463
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:16,715
So, your school in a bit of a jam?

464
00:51:17,937 --> 00:51:23,309
I'm here to tell you that I'll continue
teaching martial arts even without a school

465
00:51:23,429 --> 00:51:25,573
And I'll never pay you a single cent!

466
00:51:25,926 --> 00:51:27,360
Don't ever harass my disciples again

467
00:51:27,374 --> 00:51:29,102
And don't get other people involved

468
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:32,804
You are causing trouble by not following the rules

469
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:35,225
If it weren't for me placating the Westerners

470
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:38,961
Do you think everyone else can teach martial arts in peace?

471
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:41,514
You chose to collude with the Westerners

472
00:51:41,634 --> 00:51:45,168
Yip Man, you only think about yourself

473
00:51:45,517 --> 00:51:49,502
You don't have 200 disciples, of course you
don't need the blessings of the Westerners

474
00:51:49,622 --> 00:51:51,393
Of course you can take it easy

475
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:58,448
I understand what you're saying

476
00:51:58,568 --> 00:52:03,662
As Masters, aren't we are obligated to guide our own disciples first?

477
00:52:04,884 --> 00:52:06,894
My conscience is clear

478
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:13,076
As you wish. If you're upset with
me in the future, come directly to me
Goodbye!

479
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:14,216
Hold it!

480
00:52:14,815 --> 00:52:16,743
You're not leaving that easily

481
00:52:16,978 --> 00:52:18,000
What do you want then?

482
00:52:18,447 --> 00:52:20,974
We did not finish our match earlier.
It's time to finish it

483
00:52:32,047 --> 00:52:33,598
Watch out!

484
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,347
Husband, we've been waiting
for you to start dinner

485
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:45,355
The children are hungry. Are you finished
discussing business?

486
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:06,769
Master Hong, do you think it's more important to
have dinner with your family, or to finish the match?

487
00:53:11,076 --> 00:53:12,639
What does everyone want to eat?

488
00:53:12,759 --> 00:53:14,743
Ice cream!!

489
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,082
I'll bring you all out for ice cream after dinner

490
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:25,824
I'll take my leave, Master Hong

491
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:30,255
Please see yourself out

492
00:53:49,373 --> 00:53:50,231
Master

493
00:53:50,489 --> 00:53:53,220
Come in

494
00:53:54,595 --> 00:53:56,064
Put it over there

495
00:53:56,852 --> 00:53:58,121
Here, over here

496
00:53:58,133 --> 00:54:00,450
Why are the wooden men brought back home?

497
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:04,258
The rooftop is being rented
to someone else

498
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:07,325
So I've brought them home

499
00:54:13,937 --> 00:54:19,132
Ok, you go on home. We'll start
training here tomorrow morning

500
00:54:19,414 --> 00:54:21,224
- Train here?
- Yes

501
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,715
Be here early tomorrow morning

502
00:54:23,835 --> 00:54:24,691
Bye Master

503
00:54:24,714 --> 00:54:25,478
Go home and relax

504
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,230
Goodbye Master

505
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:39,169
Master, I wish to talk to you

506
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:50,782
Have some tea, Liang

507
00:54:55,193 --> 00:54:56,439
Have a seat

508
00:55:03,048 --> 00:55:08,420
Master, it's my fault that
you lost the school. I'm sorry

509
00:55:08,713 --> 00:55:11,981
Please, get up

510
00:55:12,618 --> 00:55:14,052
Get up

511
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:17,578
Come, sit down and we'll talk

512
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,127
Liang, do you think I'm very skilful?

513
00:55:31,009 --> 00:55:34,204
Of course! You can fight off 10 men!

514
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,793
What about 20 years later?

515
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:40,944
In 20 year's time, you can beat me easily

516
00:55:42,317 --> 00:55:44,466
People will grow old

517
00:55:45,017 --> 00:55:48,506
No one's invincible forever in this world

518
00:55:49,406 --> 00:55:54,144
Actually, you have a knack for martial arts

519
00:55:54,264 --> 00:55:58,648
However, you're only focusing on the fighting techniques

520
00:55:59,257 --> 00:56:02,450
I want to you to understand the spirit in Chinese martial arts

521
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:13,784
It enbodies the Chinese heart, mind and soul

522
00:56:20,241 --> 00:56:21,962
Understand?

523
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,630
I'm trying to

524
00:56:32,297 --> 00:56:35,704
Want to hear a story?

525
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:45,604
Years ago, I smacked the butt of that Master Jin we met in jail

526
00:56:46,608 --> 00:56:55,719
Back at Fo Shan, he came to my house
to fight me and messed my place up, so.....

527
00:57:10,834 --> 00:57:13,273
Are you practicing kung fu?

528
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:17,756
Yes, I'll teach you when you grow up

529
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:19,614
Come on let's go

530
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:33,710
Master, look

531
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:40,776
Continue your practice

532
00:57:49,028 --> 00:57:51,072
Fancy meeting you here

533
00:57:51,789 --> 00:57:54,049
I was in the neighbourhood

534
00:57:55,233 --> 00:57:57,313
What do you want?

535
00:57:59,071 --> 00:58:03,411
I have extra tickets, and wondered
if you'd like to come too

536
00:58:03,531 --> 00:58:07,069
It's a Western boxing match

537
00:58:10,872 --> 00:58:12,808
Goodbye

538
00:58:13,633 --> 00:58:19,014
Master Hong, your eyes are red
Are you all right?

539
00:58:20,181 --> 00:58:23,771
Oh I've had it since morning. I'm
probably coming down with something

540
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:25,776
I'll be fine after some herbal tea

541
00:58:26,207 --> 00:58:30,045
This is a nice place for training

542
00:58:38,869 --> 00:58:40,590
Place 3 rows here

543
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:42,348
3 rows over there too

544
00:58:42,468 --> 00:58:43,711
Hurry up

545
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:53,718
Master Hong

546
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:56,594
Come over and say hi. I'll
introduce you to the Champion

547
00:59:01,807 --> 00:59:03,230
Hello

548
00:59:06,028 --> 00:59:09,076
Ignore him. Westerners like to leave things around

549
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,636
So when will we get our money?

550
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,048
He keeps avoiding the subject

551
00:59:20,052 --> 00:59:21,953
Do it for free this time

552
00:59:22,073 --> 00:59:26,317
Free? My men stopped working at
the fish stall to set this place up!

553
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:32,561
Don't be upset, or else there'll be 
trouble. Take it as going on a diet

554
00:59:34,211 --> 00:59:35,646
This isn't the first time

555
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:37,044
Master Hong!

556
00:59:39,914 --> 00:59:41,205
Chief

557
00:59:41,994 --> 00:59:45,223
It's ok not to pay me. However my men
need to eat. You have to pay them

558
00:59:45,343 --> 00:59:48,379
Don't speak to me about money now

559
00:59:48,499 --> 00:59:50,603
If not money, then love?

560
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:05,069
Now you've made him angry

561
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:06,791
If he's not paying, I'm quitting

562
01:00:14,431 --> 01:00:17,014
If you quit, he'll take your 
fish stall too. Just bear with it

563
01:00:17,134 --> 01:00:19,524
Bear with it? I've tolerated it for a long time!

564
01:00:25,285 --> 01:00:27,121
Speak Chinese, not English!

565
01:00:34,082 --> 01:00:35,955
You heard him. Let's go

566
01:00:36,946 --> 01:00:38,324
We quit too! Let's go

567
01:00:38,444 --> 01:00:39,628
Let's go

568
01:00:39,748 --> 01:00:41,023
Hold on!

569
01:00:41,553 --> 01:00:44,726
Look, they'll get in trouble because of you

570
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,418
You guys stay and work

571
01:00:52,287 --> 01:00:55,790
Let's get back to work

572
01:00:57,645 --> 01:00:58,844
Come on

573
01:01:00,985 --> 01:01:05,498
Don't be angry. He will get his retribution

574
01:01:32,214 --> 01:01:33,457
- Master Yip
- Master Hong

575
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:34,821
Thank you for the tickets

576
01:01:35,084 --> 01:01:38,073
There will be a demonstration of kung fu
from every school on stage later

577
01:01:38,193 --> 01:01:40,142
Please ask your disciples to show yours off

578
01:01:40,528 --> 01:01:43,459
Let more people learn about your Wing Chun

579
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:45,099
Yes of course

580
01:01:45,904 --> 01:01:46,709
See you later

581
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:04,411
Hey you, get ready

582
01:02:05,445 --> 01:02:06,832
- You 2 go up too
- Ok

583
01:02:08,924 --> 01:02:10,440
Go up and join them

584
01:02:11,714 --> 01:02:12,419
Let's go

585
01:02:14,076 --> 01:02:15,428
This isn't good

586
01:02:15,828 --> 01:02:20,209
It's not your money that is used to
promote Chinese martial arts

587
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:26,573
Stop fighting!

588
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:28,853
Stop fighting!

589
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:31,646
Break it up! Stop fighting!

590
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:34,761
What do we do?

591
01:05:41,877 --> 01:05:44,298
Everyone, stop fighting!

592
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:48,424
Stop fighting!

593
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:51,922
Break it up!

594
01:05:52,921 --> 01:05:54,003
Stop!

595
01:05:54,123 --> 01:05:54,849
Stop fighting!

596
01:05:57,188 --> 01:05:57,846
Stop it!

597
01:05:58,657 --> 01:05:59,797
Calm down!

598
01:06:02,424 --> 01:06:02,906
Stop fighting!

599
01:06:03,858 --> 01:06:04,527
Calm down!

600
01:06:04,763 --> 01:06:05,856
Everyone please calm down

601
01:06:08,277 --> 01:06:09,393
Liang!

602
01:06:11,161 --> 01:06:12,078
Bring him down

603
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:13,664
Xin, help please

604
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:17,308
Slowly! Slowly!

605
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,231
Come here, MC

606
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:36,318
If you don't like our demonstration,
you are free to leave

607
01:06:36,941 --> 01:06:39,491
But you've caused injuries, 
you need to apologise

608
01:07:13,141 --> 01:07:14,281
I will fight!

609
01:07:14,915 --> 01:07:15,949
I will flatten him to the ground!

610
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:17,078
Until he apologises!

611
01:07:17,101 --> 01:07:17,936
Kill the Westerner!

612
01:07:18,453 --> 01:07:21,697
Fellow masters, leave this to me

613
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:25,139
Everyone please stand down

614
01:07:25,597 --> 01:07:28,077
Fine, we'll stand down

615
01:08:56,217 --> 01:08:57,204
Thank you

616
01:09:03,374 --> 01:09:07,171
Master Hong, are you good?

617
01:09:08,718 --> 01:09:09,988
I'm good, no problem

618
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:16,569
In the next round, don't go head on
with him. Attack his biceps

619
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:22,248
It won't be that easy

620
01:11:16,915 --> 01:11:21,154
Oh no! Master's having an asthma attack

621
01:12:02,461 --> 01:12:04,471
Please stop the fight, Master Hong

622
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:09,454
I won't let these Westerners belittle us

623
01:12:09,467 --> 01:12:11,078
Don't get maimed just for pride

624
01:12:12,018 --> 01:12:13,640
I can tolerate if it's only my life

625
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,453
But not if it's the entire Chinese martial arts world

626
01:13:05,102 --> 01:13:06,618
Master...

627
01:14:03,887 --> 01:14:07,159
Master, yield!

628
01:14:09,999 --> 01:14:10,803
Master!

629
01:16:28,694 --> 01:16:37,942
Master Hong, I have the utmost respect for you

630
01:17:01,094 --> 01:17:07,048
(Master Hong of Hong style school killed in a Western boxing match)

631
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:41,544
- What's happening?
- Sit down!

632
01:17:43,449 --> 01:17:47,204
None of your business. Sit down

633
01:17:52,753 --> 01:17:54,546
Who's the editor?

634
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,113
What's up?

635
01:17:58,233 --> 01:17:59,495
Arrest him

636
01:17:59,496 --> 01:18:01,068
Sir!

637
01:18:19,933 --> 01:18:20,741
Please don't!

638
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:22,166
No, please!

639
01:18:23,385 --> 01:18:24,061
No!

640
01:18:28,983 --> 01:18:31,854
Sir!

641
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:38,969
It won't look good for you. He'll continue
to give you bad press if you continue the beatings

642
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:42,248
I will deal with him. Leave it to me

643
01:18:43,184 --> 01:18:46,876
Fat Aunt, you must set him straight

644
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:32,824
How can he say such things?

645
01:21:32,944 --> 01:21:35,371
The Chinese don't use joss sticks just to mark time

646
01:21:40,932 --> 01:21:42,769
The Chinese practice of burning joss sticks

647
01:21:42,889 --> 01:21:48,094
Other than measuring time, and more
importantly, it is to honour our ancestors

648
01:21:48,682 --> 01:21:50,702
It's the Chinese culture

649
01:21:53,438 --> 01:21:56,469
Mr Milos

650
01:21:56,762 --> 01:21:58,011
I challenge you

651
01:22:34,614 --> 01:22:38,021
Chun, eat quickly. Don't let Mrs Fang wait

652
01:22:39,904 --> 01:22:43,088
I'll see you off later

653
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:08,720
Mama, why must we stay over at Mrs Fang's?

654
01:23:09,483 --> 01:23:13,697
Because Daddy wants to train

655
01:23:15,984 --> 01:23:18,405
Here, let me

656
01:23:18,525 --> 01:23:21,050
- Sorry for the trouble
- It's no trouble

657
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:23,292
The boy is Yip Chun

658
01:23:23,786 --> 01:23:26,341
Mr Yip, you must beat that Westerner!

659
01:23:27,641 --> 01:23:30,018
I'll bring these in first

660
01:23:45,873 --> 01:23:48,929
Don't worry about us. Concentrate on your training

661
01:23:49,928 --> 01:23:51,256
But don't stay up too late

662
01:23:51,961 --> 01:23:53,877
You must win

663
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:01,143
Let's go

664
01:24:02,307 --> 01:24:03,259
You go on home

665
01:24:17,437 --> 01:24:20,892
Normally I live alone. Just make yourselves at home

666
01:24:22,373 --> 01:24:23,431
This is your bed

667
01:24:40,237 --> 01:24:41,385
It's ok. Continue

668
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,353
I said, continue!

669
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:52,584
What's wrong?

670
01:24:53,204 --> 01:24:55,040
Police!

671
01:24:56,992 --> 01:24:58,048
What are you writing?

672
01:24:59,035 --> 01:24:59,930
Still dare to write?

673
01:25:00,756 --> 01:25:02,432
Not afraid of another beating?

674
01:25:05,316 --> 01:25:09,678
"Wing Chun Master accepts challenge to a Western boxing match"

675
01:25:09,798 --> 01:25:11,698
Do you think that's good enough?

676
01:25:11,818 --> 01:25:14,980
Why not "Western Dog Soundly Defeated"?

677
01:25:20,603 --> 01:25:24,058
"Reporter endures Police brutality for the truth"

678
01:25:24,074 --> 01:25:26,118
But did you get the truth?

679
01:25:26,124 --> 01:25:27,029
I have the truth!

680
01:25:28,884 --> 01:25:32,860
You have guts. I'll give you the truth
and you write about him till he is ruined

681
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,202
Ok, ok!

682
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:38,845
That Chief hates us Chinese. Always bullies us

683
01:25:38,965 --> 01:25:42,663
I'll break the real news to you, 
you report it. It will finish him off!

684
01:26:08,248 --> 01:26:10,630
Mrs Yip, what's wrong?

685
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:13,220
Oh you're in labour! Chun, go fetch your father!

686
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,477
No, I don't want to distract him

687
01:26:15,865 --> 01:26:17,369
Then I'll go get a midwife

688
01:26:17,489 --> 01:26:19,115
Chun, take care of your mom

689
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:41,748
Master Zhang, over there!

690
01:26:47,596 --> 01:26:50,697
The Hong Kong Chinese-Western Boxing Match will start soon

691
01:26:50,927 --> 01:26:53,453
The hall is packed with both Chinese and Westerners

692
01:26:53,573 --> 01:26:55,146
It's very lively here

693
01:26:55,364 --> 01:26:58,490
There are Chinese judges in the judging panel this time

694
01:26:58,706 --> 01:27:01,844
Hopefully it will be a truly fair and impartial match

695
01:27:01,964 --> 01:27:03,936
Don't go away folks!

696
01:27:04,056 --> 01:27:06,075
I tell you, he'll go down in 3 strikes

697
01:27:06,195 --> 01:27:09,125
No, I mean he'll defeat the Westener in 3 strikes

698
01:27:09,245 --> 01:27:12,653
Master Yip, are you confident of beating him?

699
01:27:12,773 --> 01:27:16,544
You must win!

700
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:19,740
Are you fighting for yourself, or for Chinese martial arts?

701
01:27:49,078 --> 01:27:51,547
The Twister is making an entrance

702
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:58,379
Good! Yip Man can't wait to kick his ass

703
01:29:02,324 --> 01:29:03,358
Master...

704
01:30:01,608 --> 01:30:05,123
Master Yip, kick his ass like how you kicked mine!

705
01:30:05,243 --> 01:30:06,498
Anyone can kick your ass

706
01:30:06,618 --> 01:30:07,441
Shut up!

707
01:30:11,362 --> 01:30:13,713
Both of them are sizing each other up

708
01:31:05,690 --> 01:31:07,582
Master Yip!

709
01:31:10,238 --> 01:31:10,896
Master!

710
01:31:11,202 --> 01:31:14,583
Master Yip has been knocked down! They're going to start the knockout count

711
01:31:15,853 --> 01:31:18,368
Master Yip! Get up!

712
01:31:18,488 --> 01:31:21,341
He appears to be injured. I'm not 
sure if he can even stand up

713
01:31:32,556 --> 01:31:34,730
Master Yip seems ok, and he's up

714
01:32:08,895 --> 01:32:11,892
This time it's The Twister that's knocked down

715
01:33:14,268 --> 01:33:14,926
Good work, Master!

716
01:33:15,046 --> 01:33:19,862
That bloody Westerner... still standing even after so many hits

717
01:33:42,101 --> 01:33:44,522
Master Yip is attacking with his Wing Chun

718
01:33:52,399 --> 01:34:09,532
(chanting) Master Yip! Master Yip! Master Yip!

719
01:34:21,045 --> 01:34:23,547
Hey that's cheating!

720
01:34:25,659 --> 01:34:28,322
You animal! The bell has gone!

721
01:34:33,969 --> 01:34:36,264
Master, Master!

722
01:36:19,457 --> 01:36:20,903
Master!

723
01:36:21,362 --> 01:36:22,464
Master!

724
01:36:22,584 --> 01:36:25,838
Oh my God! Master Yip is down after
a knockout blow from The Twister!

725
01:36:27,652 --> 01:36:29,557
Master, get up!

726
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:32,335
Get up! Get up!

727
01:36:32,794 --> 01:36:35,572
Get up, Master!

728
01:36:35,692 --> 01:36:38,650
"We cannot allow the Westerners to belittle us"

729
01:36:39,362 --> 01:36:41,474
"I can bear it if it's just my life"

730
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:44,251
"But I cannot tolerate it if it's the entire Chinese martial arts world"

731
01:37:11,803 --> 01:37:15,200
"Master Hong, don't go head on with him. Attack his biceps"

732
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,509
"It won't be that easy"

733
01:38:34,932 --> 01:38:36,389
4

734
01:38:36,509 --> 01:38:37,870
5

735
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:39,080
6

736
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:40,232
7

737
01:38:40,352 --> 01:38:41,337
8

738
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:42,559
9

739
01:38:42,679 --> 01:38:43,735
10!

740
01:38:52,674 --> 01:38:55,194
Daddy's won! Daddy's won! Yay!

741
01:39:30,814 --> 01:39:32,096
I know Yip Man!

742
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:33,623
Dude, everyone here knows Yip Man

743
01:39:33,743 --> 01:39:38,037
Huo Yan Jia, Huang Fei Hong, Yip Man
and me. The 4 Dragons of Fo Shan!

744
01:41:53,194 --> 01:41:55,054
Master Yip!

745
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:58,291
What do you want to do now?

746
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,652
I want to go home

747
01:42:46,792 --> 01:42:48,284
He looks like you

748
01:42:50,764 --> 01:42:52,210
What shall we call him?

749
01:42:52,990 --> 01:42:53,909
How about Yip Ching?

750
01:42:55,183 --> 01:42:56,981
I want him to be an upright person

751
01:42:57,239 --> 01:42:57,851
Ok

752
01:42:58,654 --> 01:42:59,489
He looks like you

753
01:43:29,153 --> 01:43:29,928
Uncle Man

754
01:43:30,253 --> 01:43:34,543
I have a new friend, and he
wants to learn kung fu from you

755
01:43:34,663 --> 01:43:35,765
Come in

756
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:43,077
I want to learn from you. How much?

757
01:43:52,422 --> 01:43:53,292
What's your name?

758
01:43:53,412 --> 01:43:55,492
I'm Bruce Lee

759
01:43:56,994 --> 01:43:58,781
Why do you want to learn how to fight?

760
01:43:58,901 --> 01:44:01,414
So that I can beat up people I don't like

761
01:44:03,766 --> 01:44:05,106
Very spirited

762
01:44:07,845 --> 01:44:10,501
Come back when you've grown up

763
01:44:27,776 --> 01:44:33,359
(In 1956, 16 year-old Bruce Lee became Yip Man's disciple)

764
01:44:33,805 --> 01:44:40,404
(Bruce Lee studied Wing Chun extensively and helped promote it)

765
01:44:40,944 --> 01:44:46,931
(Yip Man spent the next 22 years teaching Wing Chun
and spreading it all over the world)

766
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:53,358
(For the glory of Chinese martial arts)
