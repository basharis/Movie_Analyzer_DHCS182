(Door opens)

38
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,598
I suppose you think
that's very funny, Harold.

39
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,111
- Hello? Fée?
- 'Yeah.'

40
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,318
Darling, be a dear and cancel my
appointment with René this afternoon.

41
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,832
- I know he'll be furious...
- (Choking)

42
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,115
...but I've had such a fright today

43
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,909
and with guests coming
this evening... Oh, would you?

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,070
(Choking and gagging continues)

45
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,958
Tell him I promise to be in
on Tuesday.

46
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,510
- Thank you, Fée, you're a darling.
- (Gagging)

47
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,352
Bye. Bye.

48
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,708
Oh, dinner at eight, Harold.

49
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,313
And do try and be
a little more vivacious.

50
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,069
Of course, Harold's father
had a similar sense of the absurd.

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,869
I remember once in Paris,
he just stepped out for cigarettes

52
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,349
and the next thing I knew
he was arrested

53
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,396
for floating nude down the Seine!

54
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,110
Experimenting in river currents
with rubber water wings!

55
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,156
Mauve ones.

56
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,152
That cost quite a bit of influence et
d'argent to hush up, I can tell you!

57
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,708
Harold, dear,
don't play with your food.

58
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,115
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

59
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,632
I have a sore throat.

60
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,078
Oh. Well, directly after dinner,
I want you to go straight to bed.

61
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,436
Harold's always been
a very delicate child.

62
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,310
Even as a baby, he seemed prone
to every possible kind of illness.

63
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,278
Harold, dear, eat up your beets.

64
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,875
I remember in Tokyo, I had
to call the embassy for a doctor...

65
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,276
(Humming)

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,514
Oh, my God!

67
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,675
This is too much.

68
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,837
I can't stand much more of this.

69
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,796
I can't take any more.

70
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,796
(Sobbing) Oh, my God!

71
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,475
Oh, God!

72
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,951
That's very interesting, Harold,
and I think very illuminating.

73
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,555
There seems to be
a definite pattern emerging

74
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,509
and of course this pattern,
once isolated, can be coped with.

75
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,673
Recognise the problem and you're
halfway on the road to its...

76
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,910
its solution.

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,278
Tell me, Harold,
what do you do for fun?

78
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,229
What activity gives you a different
sense of enjoyment from the others?

79
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,073
What do you find fulfilling?

80
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,392
What gives you that special...
satisfaction?

81
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,790
I go to funerals.

82
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,156
# Then I found myself alone

83
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,800
# Hoping someone would miss me

84
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,428
# Thinking about my home

85
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,829
# And the last woman to kiss me

86
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,558
# Kiss me

87
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,034
# But sometimes you have to moan

88
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,588
# But nothing seems to suit you

89
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,511
# But nevertheless you know

90
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,239
# You're locked towards the future

91
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,758
# So on and on you go

92
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,229
# The seconds tick the time out

93
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,276
# There's so much left to know

94
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,750
# And I'm on the road to find out

95
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,271
# Oooh, ooh #

96
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,793
"Thou dost prepare for me a table

(Tyres and brakes screech)

119
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,919
Harold?

120
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,230
Why you purchased that monstrosity
I have no idea.

121
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,598
You can have any car you want
but that ugly horror is an eyesore

122
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,238
and an embarrassment.

123
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,629
Really, it is time you settled down

124
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,793
and stopped flitting away your
talents on these amateur theatrics,

125
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,155
these little divertissements,

126
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,312
no matter how
psychologically purging they may be.

127
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,790
I don't know what to do.

128
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,879
Go and have a talk
with your Uncle Victor.

129
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,713
Perhaps he can fathom you.

130
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,588
After all, he was
General MacArthur's right-hand man.

131
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,556
(Man) What do you say, Harold?

132
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,752
It's a great life.

133
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,400
There's action, adventure, advising

134
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,712
- and you'll see the war first hand.
- (Soldiers being drilled)

135
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,712
And there are plenty
of slant-eyed girls.

136
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,075
It'll make a man out of you, Harold.

137
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,358
You'll travel the world, put on
a uniform and take on a man's job.

138
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,716
You'll walk tall with a glint in
your eye and a spring in your step

139
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,191
and a knowledge in your heart
that you are working for peace

140
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,196
and are serving your country,

141
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,999
just like Nathan Hale.

142
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,471
That's what this country needs,
more Nathan Hale.

143
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,471
(Shouting and explosions)

144
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,032
- (Sergeant major) Hup!
- Harold...

145
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,830
I think I can see
a little Nathan Hale... in you.

146
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,473
(# Tchaikovsky:
Piano Concerto Number One)

147
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,597
Tell me, Harold, how many of these...

148
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,148
suicides have you performed?

149
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,471
An accurate number
would be difficult to gauge.

150
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,790
Well, just give me a rough estimate.

151
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,598
- A rough estimate?
- Hmm.

152
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,634
I'd say... 15.

153
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,518
- 15?
- That's a rough estimate.

154
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,239
Were they all done
for your mother's benefit?

155
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,232
No, no - I would not say benefit.

156
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,436
Harold, I only have a few minutes and
I want to inform you of my decision.

157
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,712
You have led a very carefree,
idle, happy life up to the present,

158
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,518
the life of a child.

159
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,512
But it is time now
to put away childish things

160
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,716
and take on adult responsibilities.

161
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,110
We'd all like to sail through life
with no thought of tomorrow

162
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,713
but that cannot be.

163
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,476
We have our duties,
our obligations, our principles.

164
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,872
In short, Harold, I think it is time
for you to get married.

166
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,760
Let's pray to the Lord,
King of Glory,

167
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,913
that he may bless and deliver
the souls of all faithful departed

168
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,992
from the pain of hell
and the bottomless pit.

169
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,039
Deliver them from the lion's mouth
and the darkness therein

170
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,398
and rather, bring them
to the blessing of light,

171
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,869

of your judgement go against him..."

You're welcome.

Did you know him?

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,836
- No.
- Me neither.

188
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,196
I heard he's 80 years old.
I'll be 80 next week.

189
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,113
(Woman) A good time to move on,
don't you think?

190
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,952
I don't know.

191
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,669
I mean, 75 is too early but at 85,
you're just marking time.

(Woman) You may as well look over
the horizon.

I'll never understand
this mania for black.

Nobody sends black flowers, do they?

196
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,876
Black flowers are dead flowers,
who sends dead flowers to a funeral?

197
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,598

I think we're gonna be great friends.

Can I give you a lift, Harold?

204
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,868
No, thank you. I have my own car.

205

Well, I must be off.
We shall have to meet again.

Ah!

That woman! She took my car!

I have here the forms sent out by
the National Computer Dating Service.

214
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,355
They screen out the fat and the ugly,

215
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,318
so it is obviously
a firm of high standards.

216
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,960
First, here is
the personality interview,

217
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,235
which you are to fill out and return.

218
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,834
Now then, are you ready, Harold?

219
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,434
Here is the first question.

220
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,592
"Are you uncomfortable
meeting new people?"

221
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,672
Well, I think that's a yes,
don't you agree?

222
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,230
"Should sex education be taught
outside the home?"

223
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,791
I would say no, wouldn't you, Harold?
Yeah, we'll give a D there.

224
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,589
"Should women run for
president of the United States?"

225
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,319
I don't see why not. Absolutely yes.

226
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,996
"Do you remember jokes and take
pleasure in relating them to others?"

227
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,312
Well, you don't do that,
do you, Harold? Absolutely not.

228
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,269
"Do you often get the feeling that
perhaps life isn't worth living?"

229
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,878
What do you think, Harold? A? B?
We'll put C - not sure. Uh-hmm.

230
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,158
"Is the subject of sex being
overexploited by our mass media?"

231
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,232
Well, that would have to be yes,
wouldn't it?

232
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,471
"Is it difficult for you
to accept criticism?"

233
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,120
No. We'll mark D.

234
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,113
"Do you sometimes have headaches
or backaches after a difficult day?"

235
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,589
Yes, I do indeed.

236
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,591
"Do you go to sleep easily?"

237
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,671
I'd say so.

238
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,718
"Do you believe
in capital punishment for murder?"

239
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,358
Oh, yes, I do indeed.

240
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,353
"In your opinion, are social affairs
usually a waste of time?"

241
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,032
Heavens, no!

242
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,714
"Can God influence our lives?"

243
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,031
Oh, yes, absolutely yes.

244
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,998
"Does your personal religion
or philosophy

245
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,957
"include a life after death?"

246
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,669
Oh, yes, indeed. That's absolutely.

247
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,993
"Did you enjoy life
when you were a child?"

248
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,629
Oh, yes, you were a wonderful baby,
Harold.

249
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,429
"Do you think the sexual revolution
has gone too far?"

250
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,478
It certainly has.

251
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,712
"Do you find the idea
of wife-swapping distasteful?"

252
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,837
I even find the question distasteful.

253
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,194
"Do you..."

254
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,118
Harold, please!

255
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,670
"Do you have ups and downs
without obvious reason?"

256
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,274

Hello, Harold. Can I give you a lift?

288
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,872
There you are, madam. Were you the
lady who drove my car off yesterday?

289
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,633
- The one with the St Christopher?
- Yes.

290
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,871
Then I suppose it was me!
Get in, Harold.

291
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,111
Were you also the one
who painted the saint?

292
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,350
Oh, yes! How did you like that?

293
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,273
- Well, I didn't.
- Don't be too discouraged.

294
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,636
For aesthetic appreciation,
always a little time.

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,430
I knew we were gonna be good friends
the moment I saw you.

298
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,034
- You go to funerals often?
- Er, yeah.

299
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,793
So do I.
They're such fun, aren't they?

300
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,075
It's all change, all revolving.

301
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,230
Burials and births, all linked.

(Tyres screech)

304
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,433
(Maude) This thing handles well.
Ever drive a hearse, Harold?

305
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,080
- Yeah.
- It's a new experience for me.

306
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,230
(Tyres screech)

307
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,277
Well done, hearse!

308
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,316
Shall I take you home, Harold?

309
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,436
Er, this is my car.

310
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,988
- Your hearse?
- Yearse!

311
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,957
(Maude) Oh!

312
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,713
Then you shall take me home.

313
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,231
So, just before he left
for the monastery in Tibet,

314
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,231
Big Sweeney gave me his keys.

315
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,438
I had to make changes for the new
model, not as many as you'd think.

316
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,275
Once you have you the basic set,
it's only a question of variation.

317
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,272
You hop in any car you want
and just drive off?

318
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,399
Not any car. I like a variety. I'm
always looking for a new experience.

319
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,239
Maybe... Nevertheless,
I think you're upsetting people.

320
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,276
I don't know if that's right.

321
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,553
If people get upset cos they feel
they have a hold on some things,

322
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,713
I'm just acting as a gentle reminder,
here today, gone tomorrow.

323
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,349
So don't get attached to things.
Now, with that in mind,

324
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,590
I'm not against collecting stuff.

325
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,355
I've collected quite
a lot of stuff in my time.

326
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,234
This is all memorabilia

327
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,393
but it's incidental, not integral,
if you know what I mean.

328
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,074
- Oh! The birds.
- Wow!

329
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,116
I love them so much.

330
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,871
They are the only wildlife
I get to see any more.

331
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,599
Ah, me, free as a bird.

332
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,157
At one time, I used to break into
pet shops to liberate the canaries

333
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,516
but I decided that was an idea
way before its time.

334
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,434
Zoos are full,
prisons are overflowing.

335
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,752
Oh, my, how the world still...

336
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,149
dearly loves a cage.

337
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,117
Er, please sit down, Harold.

338
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,829
I'll put the kettle on.
We'll have a nice, hot cup of tea.

339
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,911
Thank you but I really have to go.

340
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,310
Oh! But it's oat straw tea!
You've not had that, have you?

341
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,709
- No.
- Well, then.

342
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,633
I really do have to go.
I have an appointment.

343
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,793
- I really can't miss it.
- Ah... at the dentist?

344
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,117
Kind of.

345
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,998
Well, you'll just have to come back
and visit.

346
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,958
- All right.
- My door's always open.

347
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,395
- All right.
- Promise?

348
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,708
I promise.

349
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,718
(Psychiatrist) Harold.

350
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,792
Harold?

351
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,554
I asked, do you have any friends?

352
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,552
- No.
- None at all?

353
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,676
No.

354
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,830
Maybe one.

355
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,309
Would you care to talk about
this friend?

356
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,799
No!

357
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,793
You are an interesting case
but this reluctance is detrimental

358
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,075
to the psychoanalytical process.

359
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,230
Do you understand?

360
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,517
Very well.

361
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,593
Your mother tells me that she's
arranging several dates for you

362
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,318
with some young ladies.

363
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,516
How do you feel about that?

364
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,034
(Snoring)

365
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,195
- Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
- How do you do? I'm Mrs Chasen.

366
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,273
Do come in. Harold's in the garden
but he'll be here in a moment.

367
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,271
Shall we sit down?

368
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,396
Oh! There's Harold.

369
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,754
Harold!

370
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,469
(Giggling) Oh, he seems very nice.

371
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,198
Oh, thank you.

372
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,670
- You are at the university?
- Yes, I am.

373
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,435
- What are you studying?
- Poli Sci with a minor in Home Ec.

374
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,158
Poli Sci?

375
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,789
Political Science.
It's all about what's going on.

376
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,872
Is Harold interested in
what's going on?

377
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,838
I just think
it's such a super thing to study

378
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,673
and I can always fall back
on my Home Ec.

379
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,796
- That's good planning.
- Yes.

380
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,236
Tell me, are you a regular
with this Computer Club?

381
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,517
Heavens, no!
I don't have to worry about dates.

382
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,556
Oh!

383
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,111
Some of the girls in my sorority
decided that someone ought to try it

384
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,192
- so we drew straws and I lost!
- Oh!

385
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,511
Oh, but I'm looking forward to
meeting Harold.

386
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,833
I should mention, Candy, Harold does
have his little eccentric moments.

387
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,913
That's all right. I have a brother
who's a real cut-up, too.

388
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,037
Oh! I will never forget the time,

389
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,157
we had this old TV set
with no parts in it,

390
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,597
Tommy stuck his head behind it
and started giving a whole newscast

391
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,636
before the entire family!

392
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,597
Must have been very funny.

393
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,313
Ah! Harold! Oh!

394
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,356
Yes, dear, here is Harold now.

395
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,476
Harold, this is Candy.

396
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,155
Candy's just been telling us
a funny story about...

397
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,032
Walter Cronkite.

398
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,112
(Candy shrieking)

399
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,235
# I used to walk alone

400
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,356
# Every step seemed the same

401
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,796
# This world was not my home

402
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,792
# So there was nothing much to gain

403
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,631
# Look up and see the clouds

404
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,679
# Look down and see the cold floor

405
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,115
# Until you came into my life, girl

406
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,794
# I saw nothing, nothing more #

407
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,153
Oh... Excuse me.

408
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,711
- I beg your pardon.
- What do you want?

409
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,439
I'm sorry, I was looking for Maude.

410
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,078
(Maude) Harold?

411
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,631
(Simpers)

412
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,472
Maude.

413
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,756
How about some ginger pie?

414
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,314
- Fine. Thank you.
- I'll heat some up.

415
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,234
My, Harold,
I'm glad to see you again.

416
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,356
Do you often model for Glaucus?

417
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,193
Oh, heavens, no!
I don't have the time

418
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,111
but I like to keep in practice

419
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,159
and poor Glaucus occasionally
needs his memory refreshed

420
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,754
as to the contours
of the female form.

421
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,237
- Do you disapprove?
- Me? No, of course not.

422
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,035
Really? Do you think it's wrong?

423
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,309
No.

424
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,755
Oh, heavens! I'm glad you said that.

425
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,675
I wanna show you my painting.
This is The Rape Of Rome.

426
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,276
Over in the corner
is Leda And The Swan,

427
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,635
self-portrait,

428
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,950
and over here is my favourite.

429
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,229
It's titled... Rainbow With
Egg Underneath And An Elephant.

430
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,158
- Do you like it?
- Oh, yeah, very much.

431
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,597
I then became infatuated with these,
my odorifics.

432
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,231
Give the nose a treat!
A kind of a... olfactory banquet.

433
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,359
So, I began on the easiest -
roast beef, old books, mown grass

434
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,351
and Mexican farmyard.

435
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,309
Oh! Here's one you'll like,
Snowfall on 42nd Street.

436
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,675
I'll put it on.

437
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,668
Now, er, you hold onto this,
I'll pump it up.

438
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,471
(Whirring and gurgling)

439
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,074
OK, now hold it up there.
That's right.

440
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,116
Now, what do you smell?

441
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,158
Subways?

442
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,912
(Laughs)

443
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,277
(Breathes in deeply)

444
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,830
Perfume?

445
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,434
(Breathes in deeply)

446
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,515
- Cigarettes!
- (Laughs)

447
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,591
(Breathes in deeply)

448
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,713
- Snow.
- Sn!

449
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,189
Oh, it goes on and on.

450
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,673
It's just great.

451
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,436
But... then I decided
to switch to the tactile.

452
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,350
- What do you think?
- I like this.

453
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,558
No, no, really get close
and reach in and feel.

454
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,359
- (Whistling)
- Oh! There's my kettle.

455
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,149
Er, well... stroke...

456
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,155
palm... caress... explore.

457
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,589
(Harold moaning with pleasure)

458
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,194
(Clattering from the kitchen)

459
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,677
Here we are.
Oat straw tea and ginger pie.

460
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,155
Excuse the mismatched saucers.

461
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,030
- This is a new experience for me.
- Oh, wonderful!

462
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,318
Try something new each day. After
all, we're given life to find it out.

463
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,958
Doesn't last forever.

464
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,917
You look as if you could.

465
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,313
Did I tell you
I'll be 80 on Saturday?

466
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,958
You don't look 80.

467
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,318
That's the influence of the right
food, exercises and breathing.

468
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,755
Greet the dawn with a breath of fire.

469
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,673
Mmm! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

470
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,953
Mmm! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

471
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,596
Mmm! Hah! Hah...

472
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,797
Uh!

473
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,313
Oh!

474
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,437
Well, there's no question,
my body's giving out.

475
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,274
I'm well into autumn. It's all gonna
be over after Saturday.

476
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,115
Er, tell me about yourself. What do
you do when you aren't at funerals?

477
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,239
Yes, there is definitely
a certain attraction.

478
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,195
I ask you though, Harold,
is it enough?

479
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,912
- What do you mean?
- Well...

480
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,433
Hmm...

481
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,800
I like to watch things grow.

482
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,759
They... grow and bloom and...
fade and die

483
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,990
and change into something else.

484
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,672
Ah, life!

485
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,238
(Maude) I should like to change
into a sunflower most of all.

486
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,312
They're so tall and simple.

487
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,550
What flower would you like to be?

488
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,198
I don't know.

489
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,512
- One of these maybe.
- Why do you say that?

490
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,676
- Because they're all alike.
- Oh, but they're not.

491
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,880
Look, see, some are smaller,
some are fatter.

492
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,633
Some grow to the left,
some to the right.

493
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,995
Some, even, have lost some petals.

494
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,548
All kinds of observable differences.

495
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,356
You see, Harold, I feel that
much of the world's sorrow

496
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,715
comes from people who are this...

497
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,752
yet, allow themselves
to be treated as that.

498
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,195
# Well, I think it's fine

499
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,232
# Building jumbo planes

500
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,756
# Or taking a ride

501
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,234
# On a cosmic train

502
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,631
# Switch on summer

503
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,196
# From a slot machine

504
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,678
# Yes, get what you want to
if you want

505
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,149
# Cos you can get anything

506
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,151
# I know we've come a long way

507
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,152
# We're changing day to day

508
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:06,871
# But tell me,
where do the children play?

509
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,108
# Well, you roll on roads

510
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,595
# Over fresh green grass

511
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,591
# For your lorry loads

512
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,391
# Pumping petrol gas

513
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,509
# And you make them long

514
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,109
# And you make them tough... #

515
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,034
- Power steering.
- #... but they just go on and on

516
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,953
# And it seems that you can't get off

517
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,151
# Oh, I know we've come a long way

518
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,959
# We're changing day to day

519
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,118
# But tell me,
where do the children play? #

520
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,035
(Horns honking, tyres screeching)

521
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,958
(Man) Hey!

522
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,311
That little tree is in trouble.
Come on.

523
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,039
Look at it. Oh!

524
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,157
It's suffocating. It's the smog.

525
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,835
People can live with it but trees,
it gives them asthma.

526
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,708
They can't breathe.
The leaves! They're turning brown.

527
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,270
Harold, we have got to do something
about this life.

528
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,830
- What?
- We'll transplant it to the forest.

529
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,990
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

530
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,277
- This is public property.
- Well, exactly.

531
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,715
Well, we'll need tools.

532
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,837
You're right.
We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.

533
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,076
Wait a minute.

534
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,991
Oh, police. Come.

535
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,751
(Maude humming)

536
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,071
Good afternoon, Officer.
A bit of trouble here?

537
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,072
Yes, ma'am.
Someone had trouble parking.

538
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,073
Tell me, that car over there,
is that parked all right?

539
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,832
Yes, ma'am, that's fine.

540
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,277
Thank you so much. You might turn
the radio off - saves the battery.

541
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,836
# Ta-da, ta-da... #

542
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,150
(Officers chatter, indistinct)

543
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,436
(Engine starts)

544
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,278
(Engine revs, tyres screech)

545
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,593
(Tyres screech)

546
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,110
A little after-dinner liqueur,
Harold?

547
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,988
- Thank you, I don't drink.
- It's all right, it's organic.

548
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,958
- Thanks.
- It has no nutritional value

549
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,828
but consistency
is not really a human trait.

550
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,956
What is that up there?

551
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,871
Oh, that's my umbrella.

552
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,873
That's just a relic. I found it when
I was packing to come to America.

553
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,270
It used to be my defence
on picket lines and rallies

554
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,112
and political meetings,

555
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,988
being dragged off by the police
and attacked by thugs.

556
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,911
What were you fighting for?

557
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,709
Oh, big issue.
Liberty, rights, justice.

558
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,110
Kings died, kingdoms fell.

559
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,395
I don't regret the kingdom.

560
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,270
What sense in borders
and nations and patriotism?

561
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,470
But I miss the kings.

562
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,993
When I was a little girl,
I was taken to the palace in Vienna

563
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,638
to a garden party.

564
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,316
I can still see the sun shining,
the parasols,

565
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,472
the flashing uniforms
of the young officers.

566
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,472
I thought then
that I would marry a soldier.

567
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,473
Later on,
Frederick would chide me about it.

568
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,674
He was so serious.

569
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,353
A doctor at the university...

570
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,192
and in the government.

571
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,033
But that was all before.

572
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,118
So...

573
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,675
you don't use the umbrella any more?

574
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,757
No more revolts?

575
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,390
Oh, oh, yes.

576
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,233
Oh! Every day...

577
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,838
but... I don't need a defence
any more, I embrace.

578
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,514
Still fighting for the big issues

579
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,229
but now in my small, individual way.

580
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,000
Shall we have a song?

581
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,913
- I don't... I don't play...
- Come on, I'll show you.

582
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,194
No...

583
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,677
(Begins playing the piano)

584
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,557
(Maude) #... sing out

585
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,598
# If you wanna be free, be free

586
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,319
# Cos there's a million things to be

587
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,278
# You know that there are

588
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,273
# And if you wanna be high, be high

589
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,113
# If you wanna be low, be low

590
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,714
# Cos there's a million ways to go

591
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,995
# You know that there are

592
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,596
# And if you wanna be me, be me

593
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,274
# If you wanna be you, be you

594
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,158
# Cos there's a million things to do

595
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,674
# You know that there are... #

596
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,432
Harold, join in.

597
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,476
(Maude humming)

598
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,358
#... million things to do

599
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,431
(Both) # You know that there are

600
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,836
# You can do what you want

601
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,314
# The opportunity's on

602
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,832
# And if you find a new way

603
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,673
# You can do it today

604
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,672
# You can make it all true

605
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,751
# And you can make it undo

606
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,277
# You see how it's easy

607
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,876
# Ah, you only need to know... #

608
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,272
(Piano continues)

609
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,239
#... if you wanna be free, be free

610
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,595
# Cos there's a million things to be

611
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,956
# You know that there are,
you know that there are

612
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,597
# You know that there are,
you know that there are #

613
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,877
Oh, that was fun!
Let's play something together!

614
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,953
- I don't play anything.
- Nothing?!

615
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,955
Dear me! Everybody should be able
to make some music.

616
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,032
That's the cosmic dance.
Oh, come with me.

617
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,429
There has to be something.

618
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,318
Now, let me see...

619
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,311
(Mumbling) Oh!

620
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,675
Hold onto this. What is this?

621
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,671
Just a second, there we are.

622
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,399
You take...
This is the one. Take that.

623
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,598
Just be impulsive, be fanciful.
Let the music flow out of you.

624
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,875
You gotta make some chords.

625
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,713
Put your finger
on the second fret there

626
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,758
and this one on the third.
Then this one here.

627
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,238
(Practising chords)

628
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,877
(Mrs Chasen) Harold.

629
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,754
Harold?

630
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,073
Harold dear.

631
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,071
Oh, there you are!

632
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,114
I have a little surprise for you.

633
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,713
It's a present.

634
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,997
Come along.

635
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,352
There!

636
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,237
Isn't it darling?

637
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,393
I had them take away that monstrous
thing of yours and send this.

638
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,278
So much more appropriate,
don't you think?

639
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,157
Oh, one thing more, Harold.

640
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,754
I telephoned
your second computer date

641
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,195
and she seems a very nice,
quiet girl.

642
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,909
Cute little thing, isn't it?
I like it very much.

643
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,313
(Alarm)

644
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,917
Your licence, lady.

645
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,833
I don't have one.
I don't believe in them.

646
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,998
- How long you been driving, lady?
- About 45 minutes, I guess.

647
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,676
We were hoping to start sooner
but it's rather hard to find a truck.

648
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,591
Is this your truck?

649
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,035
Er, oh, no, I just took it.

650
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,556
- You took it?
- Yes, I have to plant my tree.

651
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,359
Well, it's not mine really

652
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,513
but we would like to get it
into soil as soon as possible.

653
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,031
Let me get this straight, you...

654
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,715
All right, then, we'll be off.
Nice chatting with you.

655
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,391
- He was very nice.
- Yeah.

656
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,352
(Siren)

657
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,398
- I think he's following us.
- Is he?!

658
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,631
Ah, the police,
always wanting to play games.

659
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,879
Ma'am!

660
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,596
Is the little tree all right?

661
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,758
Yeah, fine.

662
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,478
(Maude) Terrific!

663
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,752
(Patting the ground)

664
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,796
(Maude) There.

665
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,668
(Maude) Mmm! I love the feel of soil,
don't you?

666
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,952
And the smell.

667
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,472
It's the earth...

668
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,991
The earth is my body,
my head is in the stars.

669
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,710
Who said that?

670
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,195
I don't know.

671
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,191
I suppose I did.

672
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,840
Oh, poor baby.

673
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,118
Isn't it wonderful?!
All around us, living things.

674
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,357
(Honks horn)

675
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,991
(Siren)

676
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,272
All right, out, lady.

677
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,918
- Come on.
- Hello. Have we met before?

678
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,797
None of that, lady. Out.

679
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,998
It must have been your brother.
There is a family resemblance.

680
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,755
Buddy, get out of the car.
Just stand over there, lady.

681
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,398
Get out, buster!

682
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,596
You're in a lot of trouble, lady.

683
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,592
I have you for several offences,
including...

684
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,716
possession of a stolen vehicle,

685
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,475
resisting arrest and possession
of a stolen tree. Where is it?

686
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,596
- We planted it.
- You planted it.

687
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,750
- Is this your shovel?
- Er, no.

688
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,316
Possession of a stolen shovel.

689
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,597
Don't get officious.
You're not yourself when you are.

690
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,955
That's the curse of a government job.

691
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,238
Oh, lady.

692
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,994
Are you gonna take
a lot of time with this?

693
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,153
- Lady, please. Just quiet, please.
- Cos if you are...

694
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,151
Grab the shovel, Harold.

695
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,310
Lady! Stop or I'll have to shoot.

696
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,832
(Clicks)

697
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,351
I sure am picking up on vices.

698
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,870
Vice? Virtue?
It's best not to be too moral.

699
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,953
You cheat yourself out of
too much life. Aim above morality.

700
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,952
If you apply that to life,

701
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,235
then you're bound to live it fully.

702
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,512
I haven't lived.

703
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,111
I've died a few times.

704
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,599
What was that?

705
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,156
Well, er...

706
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,992
The first time
was when I was at boarding school,

707
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,832
in the chemistry lab.

708
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,994
I was in there cleaning it up so I
decided I'd do a little experiment.

709
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,993
You know, so I got all this stuff out
and began mixing it up,

710
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,718
it was very scientific!

711
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,869
There was this massive explosion.

712
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,430
It knocked me down,
blew out a huge hole in the floor.

713
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,832
There was boards and bricks
and flames leaping up.

714
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,038
I figured, you know... time to leave.

715
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,554
My career in school was over.

716
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,991
So... I went home.

717
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,676
My mother was a giving a party so
I went up the back stairs to my room.

718
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,673
Turned out the light and,
er, I got this funny feeling.

719
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,639
The doorbell rang.
I went out to the banister

720
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,518
and these two policemen came in,

721
00:53:54,600 --> 00:54:00,232
found my mother... and... told her

722
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,754
that I was killed in the fire.

723
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,956
She put one hand up to her forehead,

724
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,635
the other one she reached out
as if groping for support,

725
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,748
and with this long sigh,
she collapsed

726
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,637
in their arms.

727
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,916
I decided right then
that I enjoyed being dead.

728
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,918
I understand.
A lot of people enjoy being dead

729
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,991
but they're not dead really.

730
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:02,198
They're just backing away from life.

731
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:07,559
Reach out and take a chance,
get hurt even,

732
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,950
but play as well as you can.

733
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,156
Go team, go!

734
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,677
Gimme an L, gimme an I,
gimme a V, gimme an E.

735
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,558
L-l-V-E, live.

736
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,034
Otherwise you got nothing
to talk about in the locker room.

737
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,478
I like you, Maude.

738
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,357
I like you, Harold.

739
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,790
(# Blue Danube)

740
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,958
Harold is down at the garage.

741
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,793
He has a new car
and he's just been tuning it up.

742
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,633
- He's very mechanical.
- What kind of car is it?

743
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,393
- It's a little Jaguar.
- Oh.

744
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,277
It looks like a hearse.

745
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,755
Very nice. You know, compact.

746
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,434
Edith, I'd like you to meet
my son Harold.

747
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,192
Harold, this is Edith...

748
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,152
- Phern.
- Phern. Very pleased to meet you.

749
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,631
I think you should go and wash up,
dear. Join us in the drawing room.

750
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,591
And what do you do, my dear?

751
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,592
I'm a file clerk,
Harrison Feed and Grain.

752
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,194
Well, what is it exactly that you do?

753
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,636
I'm in charge of all the invoices
for the southwest.

754
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,119
How interesting.

755
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,829
We supply, for example,
most of the egg farmers in Pataluma.

756
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,480
- So you can imagine...
- Yes.

757
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,511
Oh, here's Harold now.

758
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,511
Don't get up, dear.

759
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,795
Edith has been talking about her job.

760
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,438
I'm a file clerk.

761
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,238
Henderson Feed and Grain.

762
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,074
Harrison, Harrison Feed and Grain.
It's at Hamilton and 4th.

763
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,991
I'm in charge of the invoices.

764
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,634
I type up the schedule
for the trucking fleet.

765
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,598
She supplies the whole southwest
with chicken feed.

766
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,240
Well, not exactly
the whole southwest,

767
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,515
although we do do a large business.

768
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,149
Barley was very big last week.
1,500...

769
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,196
bushels.

770
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,156
(Phutters)

771
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,275
In view of your recent actions,
Harold,

772
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,396
you have left me with no recourse

773
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,278
but to listen to
your uncle's proposed solution.

774
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:17,388
Consequently, I have instructed him
to induct you into the service,

775
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,596
and for your own good,

776
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,559
to take up active duty
with the United States army.

777
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,275
And I hope they have more luck
with you than I.

778
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,872
Maude, they're gonna draft me.

779
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,916
Well, don't go.

780
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,877
They'll put me in jail.

781
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,839
Well, historically,
you'll be in very good company.

782
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,110
Maude, can you help me?

783
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,115
With your skill and my experience, I
think we can come up with something.

784
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,433
(Victor) Look on me
as a father in this matter.

785
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,398
I know you have no desire
to join the army

786
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,189
but once you're in, you'll love it.
It's a great life.

787
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,398
Look at me - chauffeur, respect,
money in the bank.

788
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,110
It has its drawbacks
like anything else, I suppose,

789
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:17,149
but the army takes care of you
and you've got a buddy for life.

790
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,435
(Whistling)

791
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,069
Good idea coming out here, Harold.
It's a lovely spot.

792
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,230
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Call me sir.

793
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,916
That's the first thing you learn.
An officer deserves your respect.

794
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,274
Yes, sir.

795
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,396
Let's examine the facts on it.

796
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,555
I say this country has been too harsh
in its outright condemnation of war.

797
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,349
You can point to the many
material advantages brought about

798
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,556
by a crisis and conflict policy.

799
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,712
Hell, World War II gave us
the ballpoint pen.

800
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,872
In wartime,
the national suicide rate drops.

801
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,158
Is that a fact? Now, why in hell
did we give up on the Germans?

802
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,994
Since the damn politicians
chalked them up on our side,

803
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,470
the wars ever since
have been a national disgrace.

804
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,039
Hell, look at history -

805
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,669
the two best wars we ever
fought were against the Jerries.

806
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,116
I say get the Krauts
on the other side where they belong.

807
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,557
Let's have an enemy worth killing
and a war this country can support.

808
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,632
Wow, that's pretty strong stuff, sir.

809
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,759
Well, Harold, I've always been a man
that speaks his piece.

810
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,515
Always hurt me.
I'm not liked in Washington.

811
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,673
I know that...
but I do have friends in high places.

812
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,670
(Victor imitating machine gun)
They kept falling!

813
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,558
Joe falls back,
a neat, red hole in his head.

814
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,519
(lmitates gun) Only one thing
kept going through my mind.

815
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:50,549
Kill! Kill! For Joe and Mack
and all the rest of the guys.

816
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,518
Kill! And then there was
a blinding flash...

817
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,395
and I woke up on a stretcher.

818
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,436
"Did we hold?" I asked the medic.

819
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,512
"Yes, sir," he said...

820
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,151
and I slipped into unconsciousness.

821
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,872
Boy! Wow, that's a terrific story,
sir.

822
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:29,555
Well, you'll have stories like that
to tell of your own some day.

823
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,029
- Do you think so, sir?
- Sure you will.

824
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,669
Gee, I never dreamed
it could be that exciting.

825
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,399
It's the most exciting thing
in the world.

826
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,756
To pit your own life against another.

827
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,717
- Yes.
- To kill.

828
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,109
The taste of blood in your mouth.

829
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,191
The moment of truth.

830
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,750
- Another man's life in your sights!
- Yes!

831
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,753
- Will they really teach me to shoot?
- Sure. A range of weapons.

832
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,434
- To use a bayonet?
- Yes!

833
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,193
- How about hand-to-hand combat?
- Yes.

834
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,316
To strangle someone, choke 'em,

835
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,960
squeeze out his life
in your bare hands!

836
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,396
- You're getting carried away.
- To slit his throat...

837
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,040
- I don't know.
- See the blood spurt out.

838
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,111
- And souvenirs.
- Souvenirs?

839
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,670
Of your kill.
Eyes, ears, nose, scalp, privates.

840
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,909
Harold!

841
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,231
What would be the chance
of getting one of these?

842
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,710
- To think I could make my own!
- That's disgusting.

843
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,792
- It certainly is.
- Madam, who are you?

844
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,270
- I am petitioning for peace.
- (Harold) Parasite.

845
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,148
- I came here to speak.
- Crazy parasite. Commie bastard.

846
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,677
Don't you talk to me like that,
you foul-mouthed degenerate.

847
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,194
- Remember Nathan Hale.
- Calm down.

848
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,875
- She's a commie pig...
- Don't you advance on me!

849
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,633
- You'll all end up like this.
- Urgh!

850
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,995
- Ooh, filth. Filth!
- Harold!

851
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,152
Give me that.
I'm gonna throw that in the sewer.

852
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,470
- Madam, please.
- She took my head.

853
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,279
- Calm down, Harold.
- She took my head!

854
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,794
- I'll kill her! I'll kill her!
- Harold!

855
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,678
- I'll kill her!
- (Maude screaming)

856
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,638
Give back the head,
let's have no trouble. Harold!

857
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,678
- (Maude screaming)
- Madam! Harold!

858
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,478
(Victor) Damn you!

859
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,835
(All shouting)

860
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,115
You took my head! You cow!

861
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,156
- I'll kill you!
- Help!

862
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,879
- Harold!
- I'll kill you.

863
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,632
I'll kill you.

864
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,476
Harold, stop that.

865
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,395
Harold!

866
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,276
(Splash)

867
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,314
What have you done?

868
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,871
- Maude?
- Hmm?

869
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,997
Do you pray?

870
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,117
Pray? No, I communicate.

871
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,436
With God?

872
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,158
Life.

873
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,708
- (Harold) This is real nice.
- Yeah.

874
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,076
- Makes me want to do somersaults.
- Why don't you?

875
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,310
(Laughs) I'd feel stupid.

876
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:31,358
Harold, everyone has the right
to make an ass out of themselves.

877
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,591
You can't let the world
judge you too much.

878
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,397
(Maude laughing)

879
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,954
Er, do you care to join me
in a little cartwheel?

880
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,390
I feel more like yelling!

881
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,232
(Shouts)

882
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,870
(Tarzan yell)

883
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,077
(Yell echoes)

884
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,720
# Well, if you want to sing out,
sing out

885
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,076
# And if you want to be free, be free

886
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,311
# Cos there's a million things to be

887
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,958
# You know that there are

888
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,993
# And if you want to be me, be me

889
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,678
# And if you want to be you, be you

890
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,230
# Cos there's a million things to do

891
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,151
# You know that there are

892
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,276
# You can do what you want

893
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,911
# The opportunity's on

894
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,428
# And if you find a new way

895
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,114
# You can do it today

896
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,754
# You can make it all true

897
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,115
# And you can make it undo, you see #

898
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,553
Maude...

899
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,118
I had the most wonderful day today...

900
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,239
and... you're very beautiful.

901
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,272
Oh, Harold!

902
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,351
Ah!

903
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,079
You make me feel like a schoolgirl.

904
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,952
Shall I come and visit you tomorrow?
Oh, I can't.

905
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,474
I have a luncheon date...

906
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,913
with a girl.

907
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,437
- Oh.
- I don't even know her.

908
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,636
My mother arranged it.

909
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,072
Oh, look!

910
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,354
Oh!

911
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,268
Dreyfus once wrote from
Devil's Island that he would see

912
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,237
the most glorious birds.

913
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:05,917
Many years later in Brittany, he
realised they had only been seagulls.

914
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,309
# Ah ah ah, it's easy

915
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,471
# Ah ah ah,
you only need to know... #

916
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:16,109
For me, they will
always be glorious birds.

917
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,760
# Well, if you want to sing out,
sing out

918
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,756
# And if you want to be free, be free

919
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,832
# Cos there's a million things to be

920
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,434
# You know that there are,
you know that there are

921
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,998
# You know that there are,
you know that there are

922
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,117
# You know that there are #

923
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,951
I cannot emphasise too strongly
the importance of this meeting.

924
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:49,318
This is the last girl so this is
your third and final chance.

925
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,119
And please try to be serious, Harold.

926
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,953
If not for your sake,
at least for hers. Oh!

927
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,871
There she is.

928
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,520
Sunshine, I'd like you
to meet Harold.

929
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,556
Harold, this is Sunshine Doré.

930
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,676
How do... How do you do?

931
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,671
Oh, I can't complain.

932
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,916
Sunshine is an actress, Harold.

933
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,673
- I like to think so.
- Hmm, wonderful.

934
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,638
Why don't you two go down
to the music room

935
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,109
and I'll follow with some drinks.

936
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,953
Or perhaps Starlight
would like a cigarette.

937
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,952
- Oooh, Sunshine!
- Oh, yes, of course.

938
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,632
Sunshine.

939
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,755
Would you like a cigarette?

940
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,798
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.

941
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,950
Is Sunshine your real name?

942
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:55,034
Well, actually it was the name
of my drama teacher, Louis Sunshine.

943
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,031
Perhaps you've heard of him?

944
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,432
He was such an influence on
the development of my instrument.

945
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,195
Er, that means my body
in theatre talk.

946
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,555
Doré is my real name.

947
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,712
Well, Dore, actually.

948
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:16,316
Oh, my! What a lovely place
you have here.

949
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,636
(Door creaking)

950
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,551
(Continues creaking)

951
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,438
Do you play?

952
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,355
No. I am learning the ban...
The harmonica.

953
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,634
Is this your father?

954
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,069
No. It's my Uncle Victor.

955
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:45,109
He's in the army. I do so like
the military, don't you?

956
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,633
What a wonderful collection
of knives. May I see them?

957
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,870
No, don't touch. They're very old.

958
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,235
Do you enjoy knives?

959
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,958
Oh, yes!

960
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,838
You might find this one interesting.

961
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,593
- It's a Hara-Kiri blade.
- (Giggles)

962
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,238
What's Hara-Kiri?

963
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,996
Whaaa!

964
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,156
(Moaning)

965
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,272
(Cries out)

966
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,432
Hiraki!

967
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,598
Oh!

968
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,758
(Admiringly) Harold!

969
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,957
Oh, that was marvellous!

970
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,600
Oh, it had the ring of truth.

971
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:44,231
I played Juliet
in the Sunshine Playhouse.

972
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,880
Louis thought it was
my best performance.

973
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:54,511
What's here?
A cup, closed in my true love's hand?

974
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,795
(Sniffing)

975
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,670
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

976
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,871
O, happy dagger.

977
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,958
O, happy dagger,

978
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:14,079
this is thy sheath,
there rest... (Gags)

979
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:18,153
...and let me die... (Moans)

980
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,195
I-I've...

981
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,193
Oh! Harold!

982
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,635
That was your last date.

983
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,838
(# Fairground organ)

984
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,875
(Harold) It wasn't very scary.

985
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,713
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.

986
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,475
Oh, come on, you loved it.
It was a new experience.

987
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,357
(Maude laughs)

988
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,716
(All laughing and cheering)

989
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,672
(Harold) You sure have a way
with people.

990
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,796
Well, they're my species.

991
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,434
- (Harold) Look at these stars.
- Mmm.

992
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,954
- Maude...
- Yes?

993
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,833
Here.

994
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,878
A gift!

995
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,116
"Harold loves Maude"

996
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,755
And Maude loves Harold.

997
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:24,395
This is the nicest present
that I've received in years.

998
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,632
(Splash)

999
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,592
So I'll always know where it is.

1000
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,480
# I think I see the light

1001
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,872
# Coming to me, coming through me

1002
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,554
# Giving me a second sight

1003
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,278
# So shine, shine, shine

1004
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,999
# Shine, shine, shine

1005
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:21,359
# Shine, shine, shine
shine, shine, shine

1006
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,079
# Shine, shine, shine

1007
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:28,358
# Shine, shine, shine #

1008
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,235
Could I speak with Fée, please?

1009
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,513
Fée? Darling,
I know René will be furious but...

1010
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,592
If he knew what I had to put up with
in the last few days.

1011
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,432
- Mother.
- Not now, dear.

1012
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,636
Could you put me down for Monday?

1013
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:52,553
- I'd like to talk to you.
- I'm on the phone.

1014
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,437
I'm getting married.

1015
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,112
What did you say?

1016
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,473
I'm getting married.

1017
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,318
Hold the line, Fée.

1018
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,631
To who?

1019
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:18,437
I suppose you think this
is very funny, Harold. A sunflower.

1020
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,440
You can't be serious.

1021
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,909
Your mother has spoken to me
about your marriage plan

1022
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,231
and although I have nothing
against marriage,

1023
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,472
I don't think
this is quite, er... normal.

1024
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,792
A very common neurosis,
particularly in this society,

1025
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:11,159
whereby the male child subconsciously
wishes to sleep with his mother.

1026
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,350
Of course, what puzzles me, Harold,

1027
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,318
is that you want to sleep
with your grandmother.

1028
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,437
I would be remiss in my duty...

1029
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,954
if I did not tell you...

1030
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,031
that the idea of...

1031
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,038
intercourse...

1032
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,995
and the fact of your firm, young...

1033
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,472
body...

1034
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,032
co-mingling...

1035
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,756
with the...

1036
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,717
withered flesh...

1037
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,316
sagging...

1038
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,834
breasts...

1039
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,512
and...

1040
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,318
flabby...

buttocks...

1042
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,398
makes me want...

1043
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,909
to vomit.

1044
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,276
Oh, Harold.

1045
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,590
It's... dazzling.

1046
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,795
(Harold humming The Blue Danube)

1047
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,235
(Orchestra playing The Blue Danube)

1048
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,789
You've thought of everything,

1049
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,030
and champagne.

1050
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,076
It's all right, it's organic.

1051
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,439
Oh, Harold!

1052
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,233
For you.

1053
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,313
And, er...

1054
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,798
after dinner...

1055
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,635
one more little surprise...

1056
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:39,036
that I hope will make you very happy.

1057
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,678
Oh, Harold.

1058
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,597
I am happy.

1059
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,310
I couldn't imagine
a lovelier farewell.

1060
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,112
Farewell?

1061
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,589
Yes, it's my 80th birthday.

1062
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:06,313
Well, you're not going anywhere...

1063
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,756
- are you?
- Yes, dear.

1064
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,479
I took the tablets an hour ago.

1065
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,869
I'll be gone by midnight.

1066
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,796
- What?!
- (Siren)

1067
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:41,868
(Maude) What a fuss this is.
So unnecessary.

1068
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,758
Don't die, Maude, for Christ's sake.

1069
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,717
Oh, Harold...

1070
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,873
don't upset yourself so.

1071
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,433
I love you.

1072
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,478
I love you.

1073
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:02,076
Oh, Harold... that's wonderful.

1074
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,316
Go and love some more.

1075
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,116
Never. Never.

1076
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:20,316

1079
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:42,071

1081

1082

1083
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,195

1085
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:09,110

1086
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,838

1087
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,836

1088
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:22,991
# Trouble, oh, trouble move away

1089
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:29,428
# I have seen your face
and it's too much for me today

1090
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:36,953
# Trouble, oh, trouble can't you see?

1091
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:43,399
# You have made me a wreck,
now won't you leave me in my misery?

1092
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,116
# I've seen your eyes

1093
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,510
# And I can see death's disguise
hanging on me

1094
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,839
# Hanging on... #

01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,673
