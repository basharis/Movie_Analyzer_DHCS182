1
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:16,427
That old bitch.

2
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,663
I'm serious.

3
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,465
If I have to jump
over another pommel horse,

4
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,100
or whatever
they're called.

5
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,736
You guys should probably
put that out.

6
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,037
Why?

7
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,039
'Cause Jenkins is, like,
five feet behind me.

8
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:33,244
Oh. Sorry.

9
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,194
<i>Why are you always mad?</i>

10
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:51,729
Because you
make me mad.

11
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,465
Just once,
I would love--

12
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:57,669
Okay, can we just please
stop talking about it now?

13
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,470
Sure.

14
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,204
Fine.

15
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,548
Who was that girl
in the office with you?

16
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:11,683
Maureen? She's cool.

17
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,851
Today was the first time
we really talked.

18
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:15,153
I like her.

19
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,354
Oh, good. We can
play together then.

20
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,091
<i>So guess what?
- What?</i>

21
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:22,794
Nate asked me to go
to the movies with him.

22
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,862
Oh, my God. A second date,
and you didn't tell me?

23
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,764
Well, he just
asked me in Trig.

24
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:28,466
Well, I'm gonna come
as your chaperone

25
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,201
and make sure
nothing untoward happens.

26
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:32,003
Mm, that's okay.

27
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:33,905
We can double-date,
if you want.

28
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,139
Bring your professor.

29
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,575
Yeah, right.

30
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:39,143
Did I tell you
I've been calling him?

31
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:40,745
No.
- Yeah.

32
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,513
But I keep getting
his stupid machine.

33
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:44,248
He's got, like,
a hundred messages

34
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:46,417
of me just calling, and
freaking out and hanging up.

35
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:50,988
When is it all
gonna start?

36
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:52,757
When is what
gonna start?

37
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:54,959
Our lives.
Not all of this.

38
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,361
You know what
you should do?

39
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,096
Buy him
a frozen yogurt.

40
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,464
Mm, that's what
I did with Nate,

41
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,965
and I got a second
date out of it.

42
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,700
I have to go to
the bathroom.

43
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:04,268
we're gonna be
late for class.

44
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:06,771
Sorry.

45
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:12,110
Okay.

46
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,111
So if we're,
like,

47
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,646
70-whatever
percent water...

48
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,683
then that's kind of like
there's no boundaries.

49
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,685
I mean, people think skin
is just this thing,

50
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:21,586
like rubber,
but it's not.

51
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,054
It's just
more water.

52
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,056
Are you high?

53
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:26,791
You are so high.

54
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:29,827
You are, like,
72 percent bong water.

55
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,496
Life is my drug,
Maureen, so--

56
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,164
Okay, then let me
see your purse.

57
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:38,169
We are so
styling.

58
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,338
Yeah. By Briar Hill standards.

59
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,407
No, objectively.
We are.

60
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,608
By any standards?

61
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,009
Well, unless we're
in New York

62
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,544
or Polynesia--
- Or Hawaii?

63
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,146
Or some other place
we should go.

64
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,281
I have to start
working on Mom now.

65
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:52,684
Good luck with that.

66
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,886
Do you realize we're old enough
to get married?

67
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,120
Maybe we should go
to college first.

68
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:58,356
Yeah, I'm saying we could
if we wanted to.

69
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,691
You need
your parents' permission.

70
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,659
All right. Just so long as
you know that you and Nate

71
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,261
can just drive
to Vegas--

72
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,462
Except that
I don't want to.

73
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:05,630
But if you did...

74
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,534
You know, if the Church
doesn't let you, uh...

75
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,136
...before you're
married.

76
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:13,404
Yeah, well...

77
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:15,673
What is that?

78
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:19,210
What?
- Do you hear that?

79
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,578
Hang on. I can't
hear anything.

80
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:23,915
What the hell?

81
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,287
Dee, don't.

82
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,293
It's probably just
some stupid prank.

83
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,528
Come on. Go, go.

84
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:39,797
I bet Ryan decided he hasn't
been a big enough asshole

85
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:41,065
for the past--

86
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,068
Oh, my God.

87
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:44,869
Stop shooting!

88
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:51,209
I know who it is.

89
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,214
It's Michael Patrick.

90
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,115
What?

91
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,218
Yesterday in Trig,
he told me

92
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,719
he was gonna bring
a gun to school,

93
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,654
and he was gonna kill...
- Who?

94
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:07,959
Everybody.

95
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,928
"All you fuckheads."
You know, what a freak.

96
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,964
Didn't tell
anybody?

97
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,499
I thought he was just kidding.

98
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,601
Maybe they stopped him.

99
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,869
Shh.

100
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:20,171
Michael, no. No.

101
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:21,739
Mr. McCleod.

102
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,674
No!

103
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,123
Hey.

104
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:42,393
Michael?

105
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:43,728
Diana.

106
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:49,801
Michael, don't
kill us, please.

107
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,912
Please.

108
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,351
Diana!

109
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:29,300
Diana!

110
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,007
How are you?

111
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:37,842
Okay?

112
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,578
I'm fine.

113
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,349
Because...

114
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,850
I know.

115
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,589
I just have to
keep it together this week.

116
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:55,827
I'll be fine.

117
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,278
Mommy.

118
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,449
Hm.

119
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:30,955
Where are you?

120
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:35,126
Mommy.

121
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,764
It's not even
remotely amusing.

122
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,265
Hm.

123
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,767
Where's my little
girl?

124
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,605
Is my little girl
in there?

125
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,207
Boo.

126
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,808
What are you doing?

127
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,243
You're gonna be
late for school.

128
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,811
And don't make me
tickle you.

129
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:55,780
Can we go
hiking, Mommy?

130
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,348
Maybe in the summer.

131
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,517
Can I have a cheese toast?
I made oatmeal.

132
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,752
Oatmeal?

133
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,221
Why oatmeal?
I hate oatmeal.

134
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,756
Come on. Come on,

135
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:30,782
You okay?

136
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,424
Have a good day.
- Yeah, I will.

137
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,296
Can we go hiking
in the summer, Daddy?

138
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,731
Mm, in
the yard, sure.

139
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,300
No. In the woods.
- Ha.

140
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,601
Give me a kiss.

141
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,769
Mwah.

142
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,840
Bye.

143
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,175
Bye, Daddy.

144
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,913
I spy with my little eye

145
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:37,448
something beginning with...

146
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,950
C.

147
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,185
Um, C. Uh, cars?

148
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:42,854
Nope.
Hm.

149
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,389
Child?

150
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,758
No.
- Hm.

151
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,658
Got me there, Emma.

152
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,762
Cougar.

153
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,364
Cougar?

154
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,199
Hm. That's a tough one, Em.

155
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,739
What's a conscience?

156
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,141
Where'd you hear that?

157
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,309
Dad was talking
to himself...

158
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,210
in his study.

159
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,047
It's complicated.

160
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,948
Not today, Emma.

161
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:19,323
<i># Trying to find her
She's not there #</i>

162
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,561
<i>MAN
This week,</i>

163
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,862
<i>of the tragic date,</i>

164
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,964
<i>a memorial
at Hillview High School</i>

165
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,267
<i>honoring both the victims
and the survivor--</i>

166
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,539
Your lunch is
in your backpack.

167
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,507
Oh, Mom. Please.

168
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,679
Shall I come in
with you?

169
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,183
Come on.

170
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,796
Good morning.
- Come in, children.

171
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,798
Okay.
- Okay. Give me a hug.

172
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,533
Mm.

173
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,169
Be good.

174
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,103
Emma. Come on.

175
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:42,106
Don't run,
girls.

176
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,685
Hey, Amanda.
- Hey, Diana.

177
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,289
Hey, Amanda.
- Hey, Diana.

178
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,394
So are you going?

179
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,032
I saw the bleachers
in the street.

180
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,468
Mm.

181
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,937
I don't know.

182
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,238
I'll think
about it.

183
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,378
It comes out
in strange ways.

184
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,746
What do you mean?

185
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,815
Bethany told me
that Emma's been

186
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,883
getting in trouble
in school again.

187
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,518
Not that I'd worry.

188
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,287
I mean, you were
pretty wild.

189
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,155
I remember when
you got arrested

190
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,290
for kicking that boy
in the nuts.

191
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,258
I didn't get arrested.

192
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,130
That nun just gave me
a dirty look.

193
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,470
Is it possible that
nothing changes in this town?

194
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,071
Except you.

195
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:23,908
Hey!

196
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,177
Hey, Diana. Hey!

197
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,211
Oh, get the fuck
off me.

198
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,613
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

199
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,981
Fuck do you think
you are?

200
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,016
You're just a fucking
dirty little slut--

201
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,285
Shit.

202
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,561
You have two seconds
to wipe that smirk

203
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,295
off your face.

204
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,399
<i>Fuck you.</i>

205
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,734
I mean...

206
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,203
I was really into it
and I turned around,

207
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,038
and he'd pulled out his...

208
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,873
you know,
and I was so pissed.

209
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,544
You think coral isn't alive.
Like, it's a rock.

210
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,912
But it's alive,
you know.

211
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,380
It's a living thing,
with a brain.

212
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,083
And I just felt like
I was so close to...

213
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,217
something.

214
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,921
Maybe I was just high.
I don't know, but...

215
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,191
now I can't take
goddamn Driver's Ed

216
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,126
because they found me
with pot.

217
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,761
Like, big fucking deal,
you know?

218
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,595
Oh, what are you
gonna do now?

219
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,265
It's like I told
Officer Petersen,

220
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,434
I solemnly promise to take
a break from the pot.

221
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,837
But I can't make any promises
about kicking men in the nuts.

222
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,271
I mean about
Driver's Ed.

223
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,242
I can teach you
how to drive.

224
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,383
Okay. So, uh,

225
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,218
The one on the right
is the gas,

226
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,919
and the one on the left
is brake, okay?

227
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,588
Mm-hm. Yeah.
So, that, just-- Okay.

228
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,856
Yeah, okay.

229
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,657
Um...
- Is the car on?

230
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,126
Ah. Okay, yeah.

231
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,727
Sorry. Sorry.
- Okay, careful.

232
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,496
You'll ease.
- In drive?

233
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,930
Ease?
- Easy.

234
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,400
Turn--
- Ease on the brake. Okay.

235
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,734
I got it, I got it.
- Okay, just--

236
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:57,869
Right. This is back--

237
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,003
Where's the signal?

238
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,872
Um, the left.
No, just--

239
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,940
O-okay. Keep one hand
on the wheel--

240
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,075
I got it.
I got the wheel.

241
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,376
I just need to know
where the blinkers?

242
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,713
Can we go
on the road yet?

243
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,716
Uh...
- I'm so ready.

244
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,252
Uh, just watch
the steering.

245
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,787
Please.
- Why? Is that,

246
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:16,854
Dee.

247
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,792
Jesus Christ, lady.
What are you doing?

248
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,527
You scared me.
- Why don't

249
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,316
Mr. McCleod.

250
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,465
Okay. Uh,
so what do we know?

251
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:01,632
We know, for example,

252
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,134
that Stephanie here
was a--

253
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,635
A teenager.

254
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,337
We know that, because
of the narrowness

255
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,107
of her pelvic bones,
and also because

256
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:12,310
there are these gaps
in her pelvic region,

257
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,545
where an older
human female's bones

258
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,247
would be
fully-formed.

259
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,882
That is,
there are parts

260
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,750
of the human
female body

261
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,685
that do not
ossify.

262
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,254
Meaning?

263
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,859
Amanda?
Um, turn to bone?

264
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:29,861
Right.

265
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,095
Until after
adolescence.

266
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,964
So when
Stephanie died,

267
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,365
that was all
still soft tissue,

268
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,733
and it just
melted away,

269
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,503
which is actually called...

270
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,672
decomposition.

271
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,682
So, of course,
bones decompose

272
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,618
much, much later
than soft tissue

273
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,286
and all the rest
of the flesh.

274
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,794
<i>Do you think Mr. McCleod</i>

275
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,095
<i>He totally blushed.
I feel bad.</i>

276
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,399
Although you did use
ossify in a sentence.

277
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,836
Oh. It couldn't hurt.

278
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,738
I got a C on the midterm.

279
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,807
I could do with
a good class grade.

280
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,243
Anyway, you know there's
something going on

281
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,212
between him and Stephanie.

282
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,715
Hm. The teenaged
skeleton?

283
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,283
A little note can't change
the love they have.

284
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,220
Okay.

285
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,256
Hold on a sec.

286
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,693
Ah. There we go.

287
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:37,795
Huh.

288
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,300
The Breton nuns
can see Jacob

289
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,902
wrestling with
the angel.

290
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,971
Are they imagining it?

291
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,507
Are they having
a genuine visitation?

292
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,076
Or...given the
consistency

293
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,711
of the painted work,

294
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,879
the lack of distinction

295
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,814
between the two parts
of the image,

296
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,449
is it fair to say...

297
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,252
that Gauguin doesn't believe
in any demarcation--

298
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,421
Diana? 12:35.

299
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,725
heh --between
the real and the imagined?

300
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,731
Has anybody seen Anna?

301
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,940
You're gonna come, right?

302
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:56,841
No. My mom won't let me go.

303
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,178
What?
Why?

304
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,479
I don't know.
Quote:

305
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,980
She's "not crazy
about teens writhing around

306
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,583
on the ground
and seeing things."

307
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,987
Don't get pissed.
Just telling what she said.

308
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:10,922
I know what I saw.

309
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,293
It was real.
A vision of God.

310
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,962
Things froze.

311
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,532
Everything just froze.

312
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,533
Sounds like you got
hit by a car,

313
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,635
or you fucking passed out.

314
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,537
You see it, you see it.

315
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,805
What if
you don't?

316
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,142
I mean, Briar Hill
is nice and all, but--

317
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,710
Shut up.
You hate Briar Hill.

318
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,215
I don't know. Is it
really the kind of place

319
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,417
that...you can see
infinity,

320
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,518
or whatever?

321
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,657
We should probably
get started.

322
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,661
It's too hot
for homework.

323
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:21,859
See, Maureen.

324
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,529
How could we have done Trig
without cooling down?

325
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,030
So wise.

326
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,901
Oh, shh.

327
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,804
Grasshopper.
You have much to learn.

328
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,374
For what is trig,

329
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,709
when there's
an early show to catch?

330
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,346
Mm.

331
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,381
Hey.

332
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,617
Come on.

333
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:51,355
Hm. This is
the life, M.

334
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,057
It's not our life. Heh.

335
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,825
They're on vacation.
They don't care.

336
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,695
The Penzers aren't on vacation.
Their grandmother died.

337
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,663
Are you gonna spend
the afternoon worrying?

338
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,699
They can't arrest you
for swimming in a pool.

339
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,101
Who's gonna report us?
Some old bag of a neighbor?

340
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,379
It's just the mailman,
you spaz.

341
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,918
When I was a little kid,

342
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,220
I used to love
hanging out in the rain.

343
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,622
Drive my mom
nuts.

344
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,091
But I'd watch
the flowers.

345
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,659
Some would get
crushed,

346
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,795
but some would
burst back up after.

347
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:33,230
So cool.

348
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,966
I have no fucking idea
what you're talking about.

349
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,401
Rain.

350
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,669
You know,
it's produced when

351
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,205
water condenses,
or something.

352
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:46,877
Maybe we're just like
the rain when it evaporates.

353
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,080
You know, like, we just
go back into the atmosphere?

354
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,114
'Cause look at
all this mist.

355
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,852
I wonder who we're
breathing in right now.

356
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,288
Ew.

357
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,725
Okay, speaking of "ew,"
my mom's new boyfriend.

358
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,326
How is the new
boyfriend?

359
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,695
His name is Raoul.

360
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,130
Oh. My mom
dated a Raoul.

361
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,233
Is he like Moby
but Spanish?

362
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,737
Oh, God.

363
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,709
Let's just hope

364
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,846
we don't end up on
the Briar Hill singles scene.

365
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,681
I wonder where
Nate lives.

366
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,549
I think over there.

367
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,319
You mean,
with the fancy people?

368
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,653
Dude, you could
have a porch.

369
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,390
Happy days.

370
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,524
Good night.
- Good night.

371
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,371
<i>MAN
The mother cougar will protect</i>

372
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,273
<i>accompanying them everywhere</i>

373
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,709
<i>until they're old enough
to defend themselves.</i>

374
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,729
Emma...

375
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,264
what are you watching?

376
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,599
<i>Magic School Bus.</i>

377
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,070
Really?

378
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,385
You shouldn't be
watching this, Emma.

379
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,454
It's funny.
It's just like a joke.

380
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:39,290
It's not a joke.

381
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,192
And if I ask you
something--

382
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,860
You shouldn't be
so scared, Mommy.

383
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,595
Don't be scared.

384
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,503
Oh, shit.

385
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,574
Mommy said a bad word.

386
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,109
Shit.

387
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,709
Oh.

388
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,650
I have some good news.

389
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,020
Hm?
Are we getting a pony?

390
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:09,854
No.
- Mm.

391
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:10,988
Should I
continue?

392
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,790
Say it.
- All right.

393
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,191
As you may know,
every four years

394
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,994
the faculty chooses from
its ranks an individual

395
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,429
of outstanding
academic reputation

396
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,131
to deliver
a lecture in honor

397
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,099
of the college's
founding president,

398
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,868
Arthur M. Fuller.

399
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:24,869
Oh, this year...

400
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,371
the Arthur
M. Fuller lecture

401
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,840
is going to be delivered
by none other than...

402
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,409
your faithful
servant.

403
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,511
Heh. That's amazing.

404
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:34,979
Do I have to go?

405
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,747
Uh--

406
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,516
Do you have a title?

407
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,084
Well, I've been
thinking of:

408
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,053
"The Problem of Evil,
The Problem of Good..."

409
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,688
but, you know,
we'll see.

410
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,523
Think you might need
some case studies?

411
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:46,924
Because, um...
I happen to know someone

412
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,259
that was...

413
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,961
extra...bad
this afternoon.

414
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:54,632
Hm. Of course, to use her
in my presentation...

415
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,400
I would need her
under glass.

416
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,234
Mm.

417
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,273
Emma?

418
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:05,376
Emma?
- Sweetie?

419
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,377
Here, sweetheart.

420
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:07,411
Come on.
- Come on.

421
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,347
Paul?
- Sweetie?

422
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,281
Come on, babe. Come on.

423
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:11,849
Paul?
Come on, cough it up.

424
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,517
Okay. Okay.

425
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:14,218
Okay.

426
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,455
Okay. Okay. Okay.
You can breathe.

427
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,724
Breathe, breathe.
You're okay. You're okay.

428
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,425
You're okay.

429
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,993
You're okay, you're okay.

430
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,562
You're okay.

431
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,297
You're okay.

432
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:33,237
Maybe I'll be too sick
to go to school tomorrow.

433
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,672
Maybe.
We'll see.

434
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,974
I hate school.

435
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,309
No, you don't.

436
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,011
Yes, I do. I hate it.

437
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:42,046
I hate Sister Beatrice.

438
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,414
Well, Sister Beatrice--

439
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:44,915
No. I hate homework.
I hate it all.

440
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:51,756
I fucking
hate school.

441
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:54,058
Don't say that.
- Why? It's true.

442
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,726
'Cause it's like
something

443
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,662
Michael "Dickwad" Patrick
would say.

444
00:29:58,663 --> 00:29:59,930
Touché.

445
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,168
Come on, let's
go inside.

446
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,672
Here you go.

447
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,454
I've been worried

448
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:26,090
Hiding games she plays.

449
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,491
The other day she said to me:

450
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,194
"Mommy. You can't
make me do anything."

451
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,531
It's just
like me.

452
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:36,701
I don't think I even
started that young.

453
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:39,403
You were pretty young
when I met you.

454
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,177
I got a note again
from her teacher at school.

455
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,912
Well, you're the one
that wanted to send her

456
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,980
to that parochial
school.

457
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,016
Mm.

458
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,584
Dee...

459
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,785
tonight...

460
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,354
are you gonna try
and get some sleep?

461
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,626
If you don't sleep,
you don't dream.

462
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:06,297
Maureen and I used to live
in the shitty part of town. Ha.

463
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,899
And we dreamed about
having a nice house...

464
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,202
with a porch.

465
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,943
Close your eyes.

466
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,313
Keep your eyes
closed.

467
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:25,216
Okay? Give me
your wine. Here.

468
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:27,952
All right?
Stand right there.

469
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:28,986
Get a little forward.
Right there.

470
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,222
Mm-hm.
- Okay.

471
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,323
Keep your
eyes closed.

472
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:42,366
Okay. You can
open 'em.

473
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,940
It's so beautiful, Paul.

474
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,354
Hey.

475
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,591
Michael.

476
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:14,358
Diana.

477
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,064
Michael, don't kill us,

478
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,098
Us?

479
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,602
No, I'm only gonna
kill one of you.

480
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,504
You don't have to kill
either of us.

481
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:30,007
Well, I'm going to.

482
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,475
The on--

483
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:37,782
The only
question is...

484
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:39,850
which one's
it gonna be?

485
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,254
You don't have to,
Michael. Please.

486
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,465
Come on, girls.

487
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,000
It's time
to choose.

488
00:33:58,837 --> 00:33:59,804
<i>Mommy.</i>

489
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,211
I had a bad dream.

490
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,318
Read it, Mommy.

491
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:15,953
It's the only one that helps me.

492
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,893
<i>When the voices of children
Are heard on the green</i>

493
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,296
<i>And laughing is heard
On the hill</i>

494
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:28,199
<i>My heart is at rest
Within my breast</i>

495
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,535
<i>And everything else
is still</i>

496
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,271
<i>Then come home, my children</i>

497
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,840
<i>The sun has gone down</i>

498
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:39,176
<i>And the dews
of night arise</i>

499
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,513
<i>Come, come, let us play</i>

500
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,249
<i>And let us away</i>

501
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,185
<i>Till the morning appears
in the skies</i>

502
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,589
<i>No, no, let us play</i>

503
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,858
<i>For it is yet day</i>

504
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,961
<i>And we cannot go to sleep</i>

505
00:34:56,962 --> 00:35:01,599
<i>Besides, in the sky
The little birds fly</i>

506
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,635
<i>And the hills are
all covered with sheep</i>

507
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:07,838
<i>Well, well</i>

508
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,607
<i>Go and play</i>

509
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,176
<i>Till the light fades away</i>

510
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:15,346
<i>And then go home to bed</i>

511
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:18,149
<i>The little ones leaped
and shouted</i>

512
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,217
<i>And laughed</i>

513
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,952
<i>And all the hills...</i>

514
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,389
<i>...echoed</i>

515
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:40,604
Why does it have to be

516
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:27,785
All right, wait. Hold up.

517
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:28,953
Hold up. Check this out.

518
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:30,921
Um...

519
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,356
you know, uh,
Timmy there,

520
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,558
he's part
wildcat.

521
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,160
Bullshit.
- No, he is.

522
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,296
He is. See his ears?
How they--?

523
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,068
Just like hers.

524
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,571
Just like me.

525
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,640
Ow. Ha-ha-ha.

526
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:51,942
Mmm. Mm-mm.

527
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:41,859
Come on,
guys.

528
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:45,930
Did you see

529
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,900
Said I would
wait for you.

530
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,369
You could have come inside.
Hey.

531
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:57,408
So how was it? Did anybody
talk in tongues today?

532
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,076
Well, we prayed...

533
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:01,278
and we felt a great rush
of the Holy Spirit.

534
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,180
So...that's cool.

535
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,382
Mm.

536
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,951
Myself, I fucked
my older lover in the pool.

537
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,686
Do they talk about heaven
in your Church?

538
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:09,987
Pretty much
exclusively.

539
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,989
'Cause I know

540
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,090
Wait, it wasn't
the pool

541
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:13,657
that we
swim in, right?

542
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,527
Dee? Dee?

543
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,597
I can't believe this.

544
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:20,631
That's
so gross.

545
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,332
What?

546
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:23,968
Would you look at us:

547
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,469
the virgin and the whore.

548
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,873
If you listened to Mrs. Goldman,

549
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:31,242
we're like the whole of female
art history in this room.

550
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:33,944
Or we could be, like,

551
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,546
this fall on the WB.

552
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,782
Nice. You made a joke.

553
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:38,382
Shut up.

554
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:42,753
M, you are so beautiful.

555
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,655
Come on.
- Serious.

556
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,390
Nate is gonna think
you're so hot.

557
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:49,060
Houston, the genie
has left the bottle.

558
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:51,395
Yeah, I think she's going
back inside. Give me my dress.

559
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,164
No, look-- All right,

560
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,932
can I just get
a picture first?

561
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,734
Fine.
- Yes. Okay.

562
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,738
No, no, no.

563
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,045
Forever on film.

564
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,980
We have a week to go...

565
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:13,551
but...it is the end
of the year.

566
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,853
I know some of you I...

567
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:20,024
won't be seeing too much of
over the next few days.

568
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:23,160
Uh...but I-- I did want to say

569
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:26,163
how much I've enjoyed
teaching you guys.

570
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:28,733
And if there's
anything

571
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,001
I want you guys
to take with you...

572
00:39:30,002 --> 00:39:31,736
from this class,

573
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:35,639
as you're abusing your bodies
over the break,

574
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,175
uh, is three things.

575
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:43,014
That the heart...

576
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:46,484
is the body's
strongest muscle.

577
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,554
That the brain...

578
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:55,026
has more cells in it
than our galaxy has stars.

579
00:39:57,763 --> 00:40:00,531
And that the body...

580
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:04,468
is 72 percent water.

581
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,604
So wherever you go
over vacation...

582
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,342
don't get too dehydrated.

583
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:18,549
Uh-- Excuse me.
One second.

584
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,051
Would you care to talk to me?
Sure. What's up?

585
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,134
McCLEOD:
Right.

586
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,536
Yeah.

587
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,404
Yeah.

588
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:41,772
Um...

589
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,210
McCLEOD:
I've got the stuff here.

590
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:00,658
Sure.

591
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:19,510
Who did this?

592
00:41:26,118 --> 00:41:27,518
You kids.

593
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,124
There's gonna be
a test next week.

594
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:36,961
And it will
affect your GPAs.

595
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,195
Everything we've done
this semester.

596
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,016
I-- I just wanted to say
that I learned a lot

597
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,085
in your class this year.

598
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:04,088
So...thank you,
Mr. McCleod.

599
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:07,191
You remember
the Bernoulli principle?

600
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:12,530
Ha. We already have three things
to remember over the break, so--

601
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:16,033
All birds need to fly are
the right-shaped wings,

602
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:20,104
the right pressure
and the right angle.

603
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:22,039
You have
the wings.

604
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,541
You're supplying
the pressure?

605
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,343
I just think you need
to change your angle.

606
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:33,684
Ahem. Reading minds
are more your thing

607
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:34,719
than birds
and bones.

608
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,153
Like, this guy,

609
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:39,056
Paul McFee is
a terrific speaker.

610
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,257
You write me up
a short report,

611
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:41,759
and I'll give you
the extra credit.

612
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,694
Okay? How's
that sound?

613
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:51,202
You still have to
take the test.

614
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:02,680
<i>Where Did We Come From?</i>

615
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,215
<i>What Are We?</i>

616
00:43:04,216 --> 00:43:05,583
<i>Where Are We Going?</i>

617
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:09,787
Why did Gauguin
pick this title

618
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:12,690
for such a bizarre
and beautiful painting?

619
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:15,192
Anybody?

620
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:17,061
Anna.

621
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,399
Um...

622
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,367
wasn't he trying to
work out

623
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:24,769
a new way of answering
those questions?

624
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,104
That's exactly right.

625
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,473
And using Polynesian
shape and color

626
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:31,709
as an inspiration,
he wanted to break through

627
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,477
what he thought of
as outlived

628
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:35,312
and conventional ways
of asking.

629
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:38,115
That's a good answer.
It was in the reading.

630
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,150
Well, you did the reading.

631
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,687
All right. That's it.

632
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,490
I would very much
appreciate it

633
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:48,793
if I could have all your papers
on Friday so I can grade them.

634
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:50,895
Anna. Can you stick around
for a minute?

635
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:53,731
Thanks. By Friday.
Be much appreciated.

636
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:54,732
<i>I think you have</i>

637
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:56,434
more potential
than you realize, Anna.

638
00:43:56,435 --> 00:43:58,869
With your grades, you could
get into a four-year college.

639
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,238
I just-- I have
a boyfriend in town, so...

640
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,140
You may think you'll
never leave this town,

641
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,276
but you just have to
give it a chance.

642
00:44:05,277 --> 00:44:07,545
No, I don't
think so.

643
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:09,146
Life's
too short.

644
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:16,287
So unfair. Just 'cause Ryan

645
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:17,555
called the skeleton a slut.

646
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:22,326
What did he say again about
the body's strongest muscle?

647
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:26,597
You okay?

648
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:29,800
Yeah, I'm fine.

649
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:34,171
I don't know
how to say this.

650
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:38,242
Just say it.

651
00:44:39,478 --> 00:44:43,381
<i>If every time somebody
says that word,</i>

652
00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:45,983
you get angry
or assume...

653
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:49,553
Go on.

654
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:51,455
If it hurts you,

655
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:54,492
then...I don't understand

656
00:44:54,493 --> 00:44:57,028
why you act
the way that you do.

657
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:07,538
Heh. Like a what?

658
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:11,342
Like a tramp?

659
00:45:11,343 --> 00:45:12,743
Forget it.

660
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:14,178
Like a
round-heeled woman?

661
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,647
A hussy? I can't
really think of a word.

662
00:45:16,648 --> 00:45:18,716
I don't understand what
you're get--

663
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,386
So I guess I can't
teach you

664
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:22,920
how to drive
anymore?

665
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,355
Shh.

666
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,195
What do you think?

667
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,065
You think if Nate asks you out

668
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:36,033
you're just gonna
drive around the block?

669
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:38,302
No.
"Hey, Maureen, I like you.

670
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:40,338
"Let's go drive around
the block a couple times,

671
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:42,073
"and then get married
and, I don't know,

672
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:43,174
wait for the rapture."

673
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:44,475
That's so unfair.

674
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:47,111
Well, get real, Maureen.

675
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:49,480
You don't understand
how things really are.

676
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:51,849
You think you could say no
to the whole fucking world?

677
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,784
It's not there to say no to.

678
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:55,186
Slut.

679
00:45:57,389 --> 00:45:59,724
Diana Adams.
This is the last time.

680
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,931
The heart.

681
00:46:10,669 --> 00:46:12,837
The heart is the body's
strongest muscle.

682
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:25,216
You know what I love
about you, Dee?

683
00:46:26,585 --> 00:46:28,319
That I'm 17?

684
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:30,521
No.

685
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,624
That you're not afraid.

686
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:38,729
And that I'm 17.

687
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,530
Yeah.

688
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:23,407
Come on, girls.

689
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:24,308
It's time
to choose.

690
00:47:31,717 --> 00:47:33,417
If you're gonna kill
one of us...

691
00:47:34,753 --> 00:47:36,153
kill me.

692
00:47:40,826 --> 00:47:42,827
Oh, Maureen.

693
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:50,668
And what do you
have to say?

694
00:47:52,304 --> 00:47:53,004
Maybe...

695
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,173
Maybe I should kill you?

696
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:56,974
No.

697
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:58,542
No what?

698
00:47:58,543 --> 00:47:59,910
No, don't kill me.

699
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:02,947
But if I don't kill you...

700
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:04,682
then who should I kill?

701
00:48:47,371 --> 00:48:49,472
I don't deserve this.

702
00:49:46,029 --> 00:49:47,163
Hey.

703
00:49:49,332 --> 00:49:51,300
Wanna drive around the block
a couple of times

704
00:49:51,301 --> 00:49:53,035
and then wait
for the rapture?

705
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:57,907
If you don't let me teach you
how to drive,

706
00:49:57,908 --> 00:50:01,243
you'll never get out
of Briar Hill.

707
00:50:01,244 --> 00:50:02,511
Say you're sorry.

708
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,014
<i>Say you're sorry.</i>

709
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:09,285
Okay, we'll say it
at the same time.

710
00:50:09,286 --> 00:50:11,420
Three, two,
one.

711
00:50:11,421 --> 00:50:12,488
Sorry.

712
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:14,857
Got you.

713
00:50:22,532 --> 00:50:25,034
Very mature.
Yeah.

714
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:32,808
I think his parents

715
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:34,610
and this one
has two initials.

716
00:50:36,446 --> 00:50:39,415
Or maybe I could just, like,
talk to him in Bio.

717
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:42,318
Look, M-- Heh.

718
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,586
I know that
you and Nate

719
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:46,122
are gonna have,
like, eight kids

720
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:48,624
and be one of those perfect
creepy Christian families

721
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:50,826
that live happily
ever after.

722
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:59,802
Hey, I don't know about you,
but I could do with some soup.

723
00:51:09,012 --> 00:51:10,913
How'd you do
on that test?

724
00:51:10,914 --> 00:51:13,582
I did okay.

725
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:15,284
I got the one
about the heart.

726
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:26,429
I don't really think
that's true, though,

727
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:27,930
Maureen.

728
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,467
About it being
the strongest muscle.

729
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:38,507
I don't think in my case

730
00:51:38,508 --> 00:51:39,942
Oh. It's okay.

731
00:51:42,212 --> 00:51:44,480
It's okay.

732
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:51,020
Maureen?

733
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:52,121
Shit.

734
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:54,690
What is it?
What's wrong?

735
00:51:56,593 --> 00:51:59,462
Dee just messed up
her English test.

736
00:51:59,463 --> 00:52:01,864
I didn't know what
the human condition was.

737
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,767
Well...

738
00:52:04,768 --> 00:52:05,901
you will soon enough.

739
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:13,709
I didn't know
you were allowed to lie.

740
00:52:17,514 --> 00:52:20,049
Heh. Here.

741
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:05,227
Emma.

742
00:53:05,228 --> 00:53:06,262
Mommy.

743
00:53:08,598 --> 00:53:10,633
Mommy's right here.

744
00:53:10,634 --> 00:53:11,400
Mrs. McFee.

745
00:53:21,511 --> 00:53:22,511
Sister Beatrice.

746
00:53:22,512 --> 00:53:23,946
You understand why you're here?

747
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:29,685
No.

748
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:31,187
I-I don't understand
why I'm here,

749
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:33,589
to be honest
with you.

750
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,257
Your daughter is, uh--

751
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,461
She's very bright...

752
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:40,062
but she's a handful.

753
00:53:41,098 --> 00:53:42,999
My daughter's not
a handful.

754
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,533
She's smart.
She's spirited.

755
00:53:44,534 --> 00:53:46,702
She disappears...

756
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:48,671
and she hides.

757
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:54,710
<i>So I was thinking</i>

758
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:57,346
And I-- I don't know.

759
00:53:57,347 --> 00:53:59,115
If I just had
this normal life, you know?

760
00:53:59,116 --> 00:54:01,417
Yeah, with a husband
that didn't leave?

761
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:04,754
Right. But if
I met someone--

762
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:05,721
Nate.

763
00:54:05,722 --> 00:54:09,225
And had kids and...

764
00:54:09,226 --> 00:54:11,360
even if I stayed
in Briar Hill, um,

765
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:13,629
that might be enough?

766
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:16,098
You-- Heh.

767
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:17,533
--probably think
that's really stupid.

768
00:54:19,002 --> 00:54:20,169
No.

769
00:54:21,538 --> 00:54:22,905
Yeah.

770
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:25,574
Hey, Cody is a pretty
cool name.

771
00:54:25,575 --> 00:54:27,843
Ugh.

772
00:54:27,844 --> 00:54:30,112
Jennifer is nice.
Bethany.

773
00:54:31,248 --> 00:54:34,583
Emma. Amber.

774
00:54:34,584 --> 00:54:37,253
I like Emma.

775
00:54:37,254 --> 00:54:38,521
You keep Cody. I'll take Emma.

776
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:39,488
Thanks.

777
00:54:41,324 --> 00:54:43,225
I wanna go swimming.

778
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:45,594
Well, just go to
the public pool.

779
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:47,830
No. There's all
those...

780
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:49,832
little kids.

781
00:55:02,045 --> 00:55:03,312
This isn't really
ice cream.

782
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:05,348
Frozen yogurt's
better for you.

783
00:55:08,118 --> 00:55:10,920
I can see
my little girl in there.

784
00:55:14,591 --> 00:55:19,428
You do understand why
Mommy was mad, don't you?

785
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:20,262
You hate me.

786
00:55:20,263 --> 00:55:22,231
I don't hate you.

787
00:55:22,232 --> 00:55:23,666
You're always
mad at me.

788
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:25,301
In the car,
you were looking at me.

789
00:55:26,703 --> 00:55:29,105
It's just because you're
so beautiful, sometimes...

790
00:55:31,274 --> 00:55:33,642
Mommy can't help
but to look.

791
00:55:33,643 --> 00:55:35,678
That's not why.

792
00:55:38,482 --> 00:55:41,150
Emma, you have to
promise me.

793
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:43,853
No more running away,
no more hiding.

794
00:55:43,854 --> 00:55:45,287
I swear on my life.

795
00:55:45,288 --> 00:55:48,290
It's not funny, Emma.

796
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,458
But it is funny.

797
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:52,161
Goddamn it.

798
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:54,930
You have two seconds to wipe
that smirk off your face.

799
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:57,166
Mommy said a bad word.

800
00:55:57,167 --> 00:55:59,235
That's it. We're
going to talk to Daddy.

801
00:55:59,236 --> 00:56:01,303
No. Ow. You're
hurting me!

802
00:56:01,304 --> 00:56:02,471
Stop it.

803
00:56:02,472 --> 00:56:05,141
Ow! Ow!

804
00:56:09,946 --> 00:56:11,981
<i>PAUL
You've reached Paul McFee</i>

805
00:56:11,982 --> 00:56:13,449
<i>at the Department
of Philosophy.</i>

806
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,419
<i>In his terrible absence,
please leave a message.</i>

807
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,717
Why don't you come in?

808
00:57:22,586 --> 00:57:24,220
I didn't bring my trunks.

809
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:39,802
Diana?

810
00:57:39,803 --> 00:57:41,671
Help over here.

811
00:57:41,672 --> 00:57:43,539
Diana? Dee?

812
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,542
Dee.

813
00:57:46,543 --> 00:57:48,144
Are you okay?

814
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:50,713
Um. I'm okay.
Where is she?

815
00:57:50,714 --> 00:57:51,781
Who?

816
00:57:51,782 --> 00:57:52,815
Diana?

817
00:57:52,816 --> 00:57:54,250
Can you sit?

818
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:56,786
Let's just get her off the road.
Don't move her.

819
00:57:56,787 --> 00:57:58,721
Wait for an ambulance.
I'm okay.

820
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:01,791
She's okay.

821
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:02,892
He missed me.

822
00:58:37,294 --> 00:58:38,961
Just go on in,
honey.

823
00:58:38,962 --> 00:58:40,563
Sit up there.

824
00:58:40,564 --> 00:58:41,530
Cool.

825
00:58:49,172 --> 00:58:51,107
Type and Rh?
O-positive.

826
00:58:51,108 --> 00:58:52,641
Mm-hm. What's the hemoglobin?
Twelve grams.

827
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:55,111
Did we doc C-cycling?
Mm-hm.

828
00:58:55,112 --> 00:58:57,179
Just make sure she gets
the post-procedure meds.

829
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,481
Yes, doctor.

830
00:59:13,563 --> 00:59:15,097
Okay.

831
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:26,175
Uh-huh.

832
00:59:26,176 --> 00:59:27,910
Right, okay.
So is it--?

833
00:59:27,911 --> 00:59:31,147
Is it normal?

834
00:59:31,148 --> 00:59:32,415
Uh-huh.

835
00:59:34,651 --> 00:59:35,785
Oh--

836
00:59:35,786 --> 00:59:36,919
Yeah, but I--

837
00:59:44,327 --> 00:59:45,961
What did they say?

838
00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:47,797
I don't understand
a fucking thing.

839
00:59:47,798 --> 00:59:48,731
So...

840
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:56,572
Do you have,
uh...

841
00:59:56,573 --> 00:59:58,541
like, lemonade
or something sweet?

842
01:00:01,545 --> 01:00:02,211
Yeah.

843
01:00:27,637 --> 01:00:28,838
If this gets any worse,

844
01:00:28,839 --> 01:00:30,006
we're gonna have to go
to the hospital.

845
01:00:32,843 --> 01:00:34,677
Huh.

846
01:00:34,678 --> 01:00:35,378
So...?

847
01:00:36,747 --> 01:00:38,047
I'm fine.

848
01:01:04,908 --> 01:01:06,375
I can take that

849
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,774
Blood freaks me out.

850
01:02:15,178 --> 01:02:16,278
I'm sorry.

851
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:21,450
I wish I could do
something for you.

852
01:02:23,787 --> 01:02:25,654
I want your cat.

853
01:02:32,429 --> 01:02:34,163
All right. Okay.

854
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:43,506
You must have moved
just in time.

855
01:02:43,507 --> 01:02:45,641
There was all this blood.

856
01:02:47,144 --> 01:02:48,511
You're lucky
he missed you.

857
01:03:11,435 --> 01:03:13,602
I never got drunk before.

858
01:03:13,603 --> 01:03:15,838
Oh, my God.

859
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:19,442
Do you think he's
waiting for a girl?

860
01:03:20,544 --> 01:03:22,478
We should wait
and find out.

861
01:03:22,479 --> 01:03:23,379
Oh, we're gonna
miss the movie.

862
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,414
So what?

863
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:33,356
No girl.

864
01:03:40,597 --> 01:03:41,597
Is that him?

865
01:03:42,332 --> 01:03:43,599
Marcus?
- Yeah.

866
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:45,701
Okay.

867
01:03:48,472 --> 01:03:49,405
Yeah.

868
01:03:50,407 --> 01:03:52,174
Please.

869
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:53,342
Yeah, I can
do that.

870
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:58,214
I can do that in, like,
a half hour. Yeah.

871
01:03:58,215 --> 01:04:00,416
Yeah, hold on a second.
Hold on.

872
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:01,884
Hey.

873
01:04:01,885 --> 01:04:03,853
Hey.

874
01:04:09,026 --> 01:04:09,959
How's, uh--?
How's Timmy?

875
01:04:11,528 --> 01:04:12,962
Good.

876
01:04:12,963 --> 01:04:14,030
Cool.

877
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:16,866
Cool.

878
01:04:22,706 --> 01:04:24,040
There you go.

879
01:04:26,176 --> 01:04:27,176
Yo.

880
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:29,945
No,
it's not.

881
01:04:29,946 --> 01:04:32,048
No, dude.
Trust me.

882
01:04:32,049 --> 01:04:34,617
Nah, it's just
some slut.

883
01:04:34,618 --> 01:04:36,118
Don't think about it.

884
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:46,195
So...are you up for
a truly hard question?

885
01:04:47,564 --> 01:04:48,364
Goobers or mints?

886
01:04:53,337 --> 01:04:55,971
Maureen, what did I do to
deserve a friend like you?

887
01:04:55,972 --> 01:04:57,707
Um, something
in a past life?

888
01:04:58,542 --> 01:05:00,409
Do you believe
in that?

889
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:02,278
I don't know. Maybe.

890
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:05,781
I mean...we have to go
somewhere, right?

891
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:08,017
<i># Please don't bother
Trying to find her #</i>

892
01:05:08,018 --> 01:05:09,919
And there was...so much blood.

893
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,787
And...he was such a--

894
01:05:11,788 --> 01:05:13,189
A pussy?

895
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:14,790
<i># The way she looked
The way she acted #</i>

896
01:05:14,791 --> 01:05:15,991
Yeah. Such a pussy.

897
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:18,728
So lame.

898
01:05:18,729 --> 01:05:20,129
<i># Her eyes are
Clear and bright #</i>

899
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:21,831
<i>And the blood was--
# She's not there #</i>

900
01:05:23,834 --> 01:05:25,201
Can we change this music?

901
01:05:25,202 --> 01:05:26,268
Sure.

902
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,584
Mom still at work
par usual.

903
01:05:44,054 --> 01:05:45,221
M, I really
don't wanna grow up

904
01:05:45,222 --> 01:05:46,322
to be one of
those women.

905
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:50,226
You know, one of those
hard women

906
01:05:50,227 --> 01:05:51,827
that are angry about
everything all the time.

907
01:05:51,828 --> 01:05:53,029
I know.

908
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:56,032
With a heart like yours, heh...

909
01:05:56,033 --> 01:05:57,767
I don't think
you're in any danger.

910
01:06:00,037 --> 01:06:00,970
Get out of here.

911
01:06:08,178 --> 01:06:09,779
Bye, M.
- Bye.

912
01:06:28,598 --> 01:06:31,000
DIANA
What's her name, Paul?

913
01:06:43,046 --> 01:06:43,846
Who is she?

914
01:06:46,283 --> 01:06:49,352
There's only one girl for me,
and her name is Diana.

915
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:51,821
I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.

916
01:06:54,191 --> 01:06:55,891
Is that your powerful
conscience talking?

917
01:06:58,095 --> 01:07:00,429
<i>Maybe we should send you
to parochial school.</i>

918
01:07:01,264 --> 01:07:02,264
Diana.

919
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:18,481
Oh. That's all right.

920
01:07:22,819 --> 01:07:24,487
Hm.

921
01:07:27,157 --> 01:07:28,657
I so loved you.

922
01:07:30,027 --> 01:07:31,260
I so loved
all of it.

923
01:07:35,298 --> 01:07:38,934
I thought if I lived
a certain way...

924
01:07:38,935 --> 01:07:40,503
cared for my daughter...

925
01:07:41,972 --> 01:07:43,406
helped my students...

926
01:07:47,577 --> 01:07:48,811
loved you...

927
01:07:51,648 --> 01:07:54,083
then I could make
everything all right.

928
01:07:57,621 --> 01:07:58,454
What?

929
01:08:00,724 --> 01:08:03,025
You can't understand.

930
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:08,431
No, I don't...

931
01:08:08,432 --> 01:08:09,231
understand.

932
01:08:12,736 --> 01:08:14,770
I-I'm your husband.

933
01:08:23,146 --> 01:08:24,647
You're not my husband.

934
01:08:32,356 --> 01:08:34,357
It is my great honor
to introduce

935
01:08:34,358 --> 01:08:36,158
one of the most
distinguished members

936
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:38,294
of our academic
community,

937
01:08:38,295 --> 01:08:40,229
Professor Paul McFee.

938
01:08:44,101 --> 01:08:45,601
Thank you.

939
01:08:45,602 --> 01:08:47,436
Thank you. It is one
of the great honors

940
01:08:47,437 --> 01:08:49,338
of my life to be asked
to deliver

941
01:08:49,339 --> 01:08:51,741
this year's
Arthur M. Fuller lecture.

942
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:55,277
William James...

943
01:08:55,278 --> 01:08:58,381
that most American
philosopher, once advised:

944
01:08:58,382 --> 01:09:01,350
"Begin to be now what
you will be hereafter."

945
01:09:02,486 --> 01:09:04,920
One might ask how?

946
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:07,723
Our deepest guide
in our beginning to be

947
01:09:07,724 --> 01:09:10,259
is imagination.

948
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,796
Our ability to project
and mold our future selves

949
01:09:13,797 --> 01:09:16,565
from the myriad
possibilities before us.

950
01:09:16,566 --> 01:09:19,135
And to imagine takes
courage and effort...

951
01:09:19,136 --> 01:09:20,436
but it gives us
hope too.

952
01:09:20,437 --> 01:09:24,206
Hope that we can author
our own destinies.

953
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:26,776
Hope that the rightness
of the decisions we make now

954
01:09:26,777 --> 01:09:28,411
will be borne out
in the future.

955
01:09:28,412 --> 01:09:31,681
<i>As much as we can be
overwhelmed by the world,</i>

956
01:09:31,682 --> 01:09:33,683
<i>we can also draw
hope from it.</i>

957
01:09:33,684 --> 01:09:35,885
<i>From beauty. From promise.</i>

958
01:09:35,886 --> 01:09:37,353
<i>From the simple fact</i>

959
01:09:37,354 --> 01:09:41,123
<i>that we have the talent
to imagine our future selves</i>

960
01:09:41,124 --> 01:09:45,227
<i>from all the possible lives
that pass before our eyes.</i>

961
01:09:45,228 --> 01:09:49,265
<i>We must imagine our lives well.</i>

962
01:09:49,266 --> 01:09:51,434
<i>We must engage
our conscience.</i>

963
01:09:54,905 --> 01:09:57,973
<i>Conscience is the voice of God,
and the nature</i>

964
01:09:57,974 --> 01:09:59,942
and heart of man.

965
01:10:04,548 --> 01:10:06,082
When I was a little kid,

966
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:08,184
I used to love
hanging out in the rain.

967
01:10:08,185 --> 01:10:09,852
Drive my mom
nuts.

968
01:10:09,853 --> 01:10:12,922
<i>I'd watch the flowers.</i>

969
01:10:12,923 --> 01:10:14,156
<i>Some would get crushed,</i>

970
01:10:14,157 --> 01:10:16,659
<i>but some would
burst back up after.</i>

971
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,728
<i>So cool.</i>

972
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,934
I have to go.

973
01:11:24,528 --> 01:11:26,362
Excuse me. Are you
one of the survivors?

974
01:11:26,363 --> 01:11:27,997
We have your seats
right over--

975
01:12:34,698 --> 01:12:35,564
Hello?

976
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:41,804
Is she here?

977
01:12:41,805 --> 01:12:43,372
Did she come back?

978
01:12:44,841 --> 01:12:46,642
How could you not find her?
At lunchtime,

979
01:12:46,643 --> 01:12:48,844
we believe your daughter
left the school property.

980
01:12:48,845 --> 01:12:49,812
How can you
let that happen?

981
01:12:49,813 --> 01:12:52,214
We try our best,
Mrs. McFee.

982
01:12:52,215 --> 01:12:53,683
I did try to
tell you.

983
01:12:53,684 --> 01:12:54,950
Could she have
walked home?

984
01:12:54,951 --> 01:12:56,285
I don't know. She knows the way.

985
01:12:56,286 --> 01:12:58,354
We have men looking for her.
She's a little girl.

986
01:12:58,355 --> 01:13:00,556
She's a child. How far
could she have gone?

987
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,161
Hello? Yeah.

988
01:13:07,831 --> 01:13:10,499
All right, I'll
get right back to you.

989
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,001
Ms. McFee...

990
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:17,068
I-- I don't know.
I didn't dress her.

991
01:13:17,069 --> 01:13:18,569
My husband, Paul,
dressed her.

992
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:19,704
The woods near your house.

993
01:13:19,705 --> 01:13:21,339
Someone just found
a pink jacket there.

994
01:13:32,518 --> 01:13:33,451
Emma!

995
01:13:36,388 --> 01:13:37,722
Emma!

996
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,258
Oh.

997
01:13:40,259 --> 01:13:42,260
<i>You've reached Paul McFee</i>

998
01:13:42,261 --> 01:13:44,195
<i>at the Department
of Philosophy.</i>

999
01:13:44,196 --> 01:13:45,530
Emma!

1000
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:50,635
Mommy.

1001
01:13:50,636 --> 01:13:51,736
Mommy.

1002
01:13:51,737 --> 01:13:54,305
Emma. Emma. Emma.

1003
01:13:55,674 --> 01:13:56,807
Please.

1004
01:14:01,613 --> 01:14:03,614
What the hell
is that?

1005
01:14:03,615 --> 01:14:05,983
I saw them putting
them up yesterday...

1006
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:07,451
for the unborn.

1007
01:14:10,289 --> 01:14:12,390
Hey. Diana. come on,
let's go to school.

1008
01:14:20,999 --> 01:14:23,501
Hey. Diana, come on,
let's go to school.

1009
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:26,571
Emma!

1010
01:14:28,674 --> 01:14:29,540
Emma!

1011
01:14:30,809 --> 01:14:31,876
Ugh. Ah!

1012
01:14:37,182 --> 01:14:38,983
Emma!

1013
01:14:44,656 --> 01:14:46,624
Oh.

1014
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:47,425
EMMA
Mommy.

1015
01:14:47,426 --> 01:14:48,392
Emma.

1016
01:14:49,695 --> 01:14:51,128
Help.

1017
01:14:55,334 --> 01:14:56,667
<i>Diana!</i>

1018
01:15:03,475 --> 01:15:05,543
They're all kids.

1019
01:15:48,787 --> 01:15:50,755
What was that?

1020
01:15:50,756 --> 01:15:51,956
What?

1021
01:15:51,957 --> 01:15:52,957
Do you hear that?

1022
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,625
Hang on. I can't
hear anything.

1023
01:15:56,562 --> 01:15:57,628
What the hell?

1024
01:15:59,064 --> 01:16:00,264
No, don't go that way.

1025
01:16:00,265 --> 01:16:02,300
This way! This way!

1026
01:16:02,301 --> 01:16:03,334
Dee, don't.

1027
01:16:04,203 --> 01:16:05,369
No.

1028
01:16:19,184 --> 01:16:20,117
Hey.

1029
01:16:22,254 --> 01:16:23,654
Michael.

1030
01:16:23,655 --> 01:16:24,689
Diana.

1031
01:16:28,193 --> 01:16:30,494
Michael, don't kill us,
please.

1032
01:16:30,495 --> 01:16:31,529
Us?

1033
01:16:32,931 --> 01:16:35,132
No, I'm only
gonna kill one of you.

1034
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:37,001
You don't have to kill
either of us.

1035
01:16:37,002 --> 01:16:38,970
Well, I'm going to.

1036
01:16:40,572 --> 01:16:41,973
The on--

1037
01:16:45,577 --> 01:16:48,346
The only
question is,

1038
01:16:48,347 --> 01:16:49,814
which one's
it gonna be?

1039
01:17:01,793 --> 01:17:03,628
Just back it up.
Folks, back it up, please.

1040
01:17:03,629 --> 01:17:04,662
Come on, everybody
just back it up.

1041
01:17:09,468 --> 01:17:10,501
Keep back!
Please, please!

1042
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,384
Ma'am! Back up. Back up.

1043
01:17:31,857 --> 01:17:33,457
Mom!

1044
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:35,927
Are you okay? Oh, my God.
All this blood.

1045
01:17:35,928 --> 01:17:37,361
He missed me.

1046
01:17:37,362 --> 01:17:39,096
Where's my little girl?

1047
01:17:39,097 --> 01:17:40,831
Is my little girl
in there?

1048
01:17:40,832 --> 01:17:42,333
It's my daughter.
Heaven.

1049
01:17:42,334 --> 01:17:43,734
It's my daughter.
Get off me!

1050
01:17:46,071 --> 01:17:47,505
You don't have to,
Michael, please.

1051
01:17:56,148 --> 01:17:57,682
Diana!

1052
01:18:17,236 --> 01:18:18,769
Come on, girls.

1053
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:20,304
It's time
to choose.

1054
01:18:27,246 --> 01:18:28,646
If you're gonna kill
one of us...

1055
01:18:30,482 --> 01:18:31,516
kill me.

1056
01:18:36,622 --> 01:18:37,722
Oh, Maureen.

1057
01:18:44,096 --> 01:18:46,063
And what do you have to say?

1058
01:18:47,799 --> 01:18:48,399
Maybe...

1059
01:18:50,335 --> 01:18:51,903
Maybe I should
kill you?

1060
01:18:51,904 --> 01:18:53,971
No.
- No what?

1061
01:18:53,972 --> 01:18:56,307
No, don't kill me.

1062
01:18:56,308 --> 01:18:59,076
But if I don't kill you,
then who should I kill?

1063
01:19:14,426 --> 01:19:16,727
Conscience is

1064
01:19:16,728 --> 01:19:19,497
and the nature
and heart of man.

1065
01:19:24,403 --> 01:19:27,171
<i>This is the life, M.</i>

1066
01:19:27,172 --> 01:19:29,774
<i>Maureen, what did I do
to deserve a friend like you?</i>

1067
01:19:29,775 --> 01:19:32,009
<i>Um, something in a past life?</i>

1068
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:33,277
<i>M, I don't wanna grow up</i>

1069
01:19:33,278 --> 01:19:34,612
<i>to be one of those hard women</i>

1070
01:19:34,613 --> 01:19:36,581
<i>that are angry about
everything all the time.</i>

1071
01:19:36,582 --> 01:19:37,915
<i>I know.</i>

1072
01:19:37,916 --> 01:19:40,451
<i>With a heart like yours, heh...</i>

1073
01:19:40,452 --> 01:19:42,486
<i>I don't think
you're in any danger.</i>

1074
01:19:44,156 --> 01:19:46,657
But if I don't kill you,
then who should I kill?

1075
01:19:50,696 --> 01:19:51,429
Michael.

1076
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,807
Shoot me.

1077
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:08,045
Shoot me.

1078
01:20:09,948 --> 01:20:11,549
No.

1079
01:20:52,724 --> 01:20:55,526
<i>So I was thinking</i>

1080
01:20:55,527 --> 01:20:58,930
<i>If I just had this normal
life, you know?</i>

1081
01:20:58,931 --> 01:21:02,700
<i>And had kids. And even if
I stayed in Briar Hill,</i>

1082
01:21:02,701 --> 01:21:04,035
<i>that might be enough.</i>

1083
01:21:04,036 --> 01:21:05,303
<i>Look, M, heh...</i>

1084
01:21:05,304 --> 01:21:06,804
<i>I know that you and Nate</i>

1085
01:21:06,805 --> 01:21:09,473
<i>are gonna have, like,
eight kids</i>

1086
01:21:09,474 --> 01:21:11,309
<i>and be one of
those perfect families</i>

1087
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:13,511
<i>that live happily ever after.</i>

The heart is the body's</i>

1089
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,054
<i>strongest muscle.</i>

1090
01:21:28,994 --> 01:21:31,028
Diana!

1091
01:21:31,029 --> 01:21:32,096
Oh, my God.

1092
01:21:32,097 --> 01:21:34,131
Oh, my God.

1093
01:21:35,467 --> 01:21:36,133
No.

1094
01:21:41,573 --> 01:21:43,074
Oh, my God.

1095
01:22:04,096 --> 01:22:05,463
Were you one of
the survivors?

1096
01:22:05,464 --> 01:22:07,131
No.

1097
01:22:25,417 --> 01:22:27,251
So guess what?

1098
01:22:27,252 --> 01:22:28,386
What?

1099
01:22:28,387 --> 01:22:30,788
Nate asked me to go
to the movies with him.

1100
01:22:30,789 --> 01:22:32,857
Oh, my God. A second date,
and you didn't tell me?

1101
01:22:32,858 --> 01:22:34,959
Well, he just
asked me in Trig.

1102
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,661
Well, I'm gonna come
as your chaperone

1103
01:22:36,662 --> 01:22:38,429
and make sure nothing
untoward happens.

1104
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:40,031
Mm, that's okay.

1105
01:22:40,032 --> 01:22:41,799
We can double-date,
if you want.

1106
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,167
Bring the professor.

1107
01:22:43,168 --> 01:22:45,169
Yeah, right.

1108
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:46,671
Did I tell you
I've been calling him?

1109
01:22:46,672 --> 01:22:47,872
No.

1110
01:22:47,873 --> 01:22:50,274
Yeah. I keep getting
his stupid machine.

1111
01:22:50,275 --> 01:22:51,375
He's got, like,

1112
01:22:51,376 --> 01:22:53,010
a hundred messages
of me just calling,

1113
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:54,212
and freaking out
and hanging up.

1114
01:22:57,649 --> 01:22:58,983
When is it all
gonna start?

1115
01:22:58,984 --> 01:23:00,751
When is what
gonna start?

1116
01:23:00,752 --> 01:23:02,920
Our lives.
Not all of this.

1117
01:23:02,921 --> 01:23:04,222
You know what
you should do?

1118
01:23:04,223 --> 01:23:06,257
Buy him
a frozen yogurt.

1119
01:23:06,258 --> 01:23:07,291
Mm, that's what I did
with Nate,

1120
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:09,026
and I got a second date
out of it.

1121
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:10,628
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1122
01:23:10,629 --> 01:23:12,007
we're gonna be late
for class.

1123
01:23:13,966 --> 01:23:14,699
Sorry.
