1
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:09,572
Big, round and bright.

2
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:14,071
They can see us a mile away
on a night like this.

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,144
Hey, you frog, stop your croaking!

4
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:22,084
Go on, you runners! You're not
snuggling in a woman's tits tonight.

5
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,357
Carry me, if you're so smart!

6
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,978
Well? Was thatyour big warehouse
attack?

7
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,053
Oh, my legs!
Why don'tyou carry my ass?

8
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,129
How could I knowthey'd be here?

9
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,562
Went for a booty,
came back robbed.

10
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,130
It serves you right, you good-for-
nothings!

11
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,707
You gotyour mouths watering!
A warehouse!

12
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,339
Why the hell did you drag that psycho
along?

13
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,711
The Germans were right behind us.
They tried to take him away.

14
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,582
If it hadn't been for him,
we wouldn't all be here.

15
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,723
You'd be back in Bobruisk,
in your kerosene shop.

16
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,423
Gleb would be
in his Leningrad swamp.

17
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:45,724
You know, back home in Slutsk, we had
a guy who made vodka out of soap.

18
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,656
What are you always laughing at?

19
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:52,735
They asked a guy with a hump:
"How come your back's all round?"

20
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,165
He says: "That's 'cause my chest
caves in!"

21
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,606
- You're a hopeless optimist.
- He should be cured of that.

22
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,679
As for crying, there's already enough
crying in the world.

23
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,417
So she says, "If I'd known all that,
I'd never have given birth to you."

24
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,114
Charge it!

25
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,522
This guy ain't going to holler
no more!

26
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,092
Come on, hurry!

27
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:56,033
Don't tickle me, or my fart
is going to flatten Europe!

28
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,171
The devil is not so black
as his SS shits.

29
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,104
I'd like to watch that!

30
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,299
Right. Let's go.

31
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,196
If you're so generous,
why don'tyou drop tobacco!

32
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,146
"Kill the Bolshevik kikes.

33
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,951
Smash a brick in their ugly mugs."

34
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,556
That's all?

35
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,530
Sent planes to deliver just that?

36
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,232
Hey, Jews!

37
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,443
Stand up! March on!

38
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,608
Well? Shall we try one more time?

39
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,179
Or like Roubej says, "Stay right on
my heels as trouble won't be far".

40
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:28,994
Do we go?

41
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,496
Maybe we'll wait till night?

42
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,262
Back there, people are starving,
and we're doing nothing.

43
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,572
Go on! Move! The Germans are
in a hurry! Don't slow'em down!

44
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,484
Damn!

45
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,146
Let's go! Come on!

46
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,226
Where you going?

47
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:45,392
There you are. We haven't seen
you for a while.

48
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,563
How can we manage withoutyou?

49
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,566
The only reason you fly over us
is to drop your little gifts.

50
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,135
How about a motorcycle
with a side-car?

51
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,273
Haven't ridden in one
for a long time!

52
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:00,913
Get down!

53
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:22,298
They get drunk up there,
and we return the empties!

54
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,548
Hold it, dad.
You'll finish it later.

55
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,682
Who is it?.. Who's there?..

56
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,552
- Quiet! Are you in the police?
- And who are you, guys?

57
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:56,118
Button up, you'll catch cold.
Is this village Kamenka?

58
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,389
No, no. This is Bagoushovka.

59
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,063
The Germans have been here
two days already.

60
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,204
- Is the cow-shed locked?
- No.

61
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:10,331
You're going to lead us out, along
with the cow. Got that, dad?

62
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,134
And don't try any tricks.
You'll get us out and run back.

63
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,708
Be quick about it. Just be natural.

64
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,951
Yes, alright. If I have to, I have to.

65
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,145
I like men with common sense.
Fliora, are you awake?

66
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,593
Your doors squeak.
Better grease'em.

67
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:34,359
How come the Germans didn't kill
the dogs? It's not right.

68
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,294
You're white and your cow, too.
What'll we cover you with?

69
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,100
- I'll get something in the house.
- A rifle, maybe?

70
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:46,370
That's a trick you can pull on my
neighbor. His name's "Idiot".

71
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,377
There's horse manure.
Roll in it.

72
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,311
What's your rank in the police?

73
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:01,057
No, I'm not in the police!
It's the defensive brigade.

74
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:07,064
Let's go now, and quick! Wouldn't
wantyour wife start missing you.

75
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,935
Go on!

76
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,713
Don't turn around, or you'll fall.

77
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,956
Crouch down.

78
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,597
Now you go back.

79
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,300
Back home. Got it?

80
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,307
And keep your mouth shut.
You tell nobody.

81
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,104
Get going! Run!

82
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,445
Or your old lady'll bawl you out!

83
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,572
I wonder what our dad's doing now?

84
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,480
He took a little walk
to do his business.

85
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,712
He had a nice pair of boots on.
Box-calf leather.

86
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,651
Maybe he's looking for us,
wants to trade his boots for mine?

87
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,232
Nice cow, good one, stay here.

88
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,602
Hold still!

89
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,438
Hold still, my dear.

90
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,602
Go on, milk her!

91
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,992
We'll get drunk, you and me.
That's the good life!

92
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,452
Uncle Roubej!

93
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,169
Ho, giddup! Giddup, ho!

94
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,744
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing, comrade?

95
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,175
I got no time to waste talking
with you!

96
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:56,242
You got a hatchet? There's meat.
A cow's been killed there!

97
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,754
Hey, wait! It's my horse
you're taking!

98
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,562
There're kids, a lot of people
starving to death!

99
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,698
And us, ain't we people, too?

100
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:11,264
People are fighting,
and you stay nice and warm inside.

101
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,076
Look what they did!

102
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,342
See what they did?

103
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,714
Easy, boy, take it easy.

104
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,612
You crazy or what?

105
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,048
Put it all in there.

106
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:05,178
The belt, the jacket...
Hide it in there.

107
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,384
Go on, hurry!

108
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,272
Oh, such a thing!

109
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,077
- What village is that?
- Perekhody.

110
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,585
- We got two families with that name.
- You'll be a Perekhod, too. Got it?

111
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:43,283
We had one like you who got drowned.
You'll be him.

112
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,429
What was his name?

113
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:49,295
You got a mother, you got sisters
and brothers.

114
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:54,971
Olga, Katka, Fedia, and little Sonia.
You remember it all.

115
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:00,172
Your mother's name is Fiokla Perekhod.

116
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,243
And your name is Zhenka.
You got it?

117
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,442
Let's get out of here.

118
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,683
This morning, I insulted
a German soldier.

119
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,592
And where's my father?

120
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:36,339
- Say he's gone.
- Gone where?

121
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,567
Where? Hell! What does it matter?
Come with me.

122
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:44,272
Say you're Mitrophane,
my grandson. You got it?

123
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:11,091
This is my family.
Aksinya Perekhod, my daughter-in-law...

124
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,231
my sister and her children.

125
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,308
- And who's that?
- My son-in-law. He's an accountant.

126
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,908
Those are my sister's children,
Lima, Raya,

127
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,677
Zoika, Vika, Veronica,
and little Boris.

128
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,317
Get down!
Search the houses!

129
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,987
We came to see you...

130
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:44,068
These are our neighbors, Maria and
her kids, Lucia, Frosia, Fenya, Ivan.

131
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,997
We know what they want. They'll
take some and deport them to Germany.

132
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,141
Who are they going to take? You?

133
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,278
Come in. Everything's fine.

134
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,475
You go and look on the roof.

135
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,394
Quiet... quiet.

136
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,641
Do you speak German?

137
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,051
Me? Yes. Do you speak it, too?

138
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,883
Do you speak German, too?

139
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,223
Sit down.

140
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,468
Please, eat.

141
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,611
You take all you want, Sir.

142
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,078
What have you got here?

143
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,089
Oh, partisan!

144
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,042
They put up resistance not far from
here.

145
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:58,266
Why are you drinking alone?
Pour some for me, too.

146
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,330
Please, schnapps.

147
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,002
Inhabitants of the village of
Perekhody!

148
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,273
Inhabitants of the village of
Perekhody!

149
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:19,019
Everybody in the village!
Listen attentively!

150
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:23,951
You all take children
and your papers.

151
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:28,225
Go to the village square.

152
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:34,095
We look at papers of all families
and lists...

153
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:41,534
...and how German Army authorities'
orders are being followed.

154
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,680
You must have all documents

155
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:50,680
proving delivery of
agriculture products.

156
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:58,689
No one is to stay in house,
in barn,

157
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,557
in cellar, on roof or in attic...

158
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:23,943
Wait! Where are you running?
They're going to slaughter you!

159
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:30,287
What are you staring at?
Look down, bastard!

160
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,720
I'm going to kill him!

161
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:43,172
Take something to eat
for two days.

162
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,172
Bring all children...

163
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:01,452
...Maintain order and discipline...

164
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:33,290
Germany is... civilized country.

165
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,357
Everyone who goes to Germany

166
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:41,487
must have a toothbrush,

167
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:46,025
toothpaste, shoe-polish, soap,

168
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,298
a towel for every member of a family.

169
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:54,377
To take fruits and vegetables
is forbidden

170
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:58,606
in order not to infect Europe.

171
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,929
l, the officer of
sanitary inspection,

172
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:28,407
ascertain that the cause of death
was seven bullets

173
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:33,073
that got stuck
in the upper thorax.

174
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:39,219
Anyone who won't follow
the orders of the German Army

175
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:44,225
will meet the same
miserable fate.

176
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,092
Herr Major, everything is fine!

177
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,028
Sturmbanfuhrer, everything's ready.

178
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,673
Do we invite them in?
Will there be any signal?

179
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,617
Damn it! Bugger those bastards!

180
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,936
Welcome, my dear friends!

181
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,056
We caught a yid!

182
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,452
This kike bastard wasn't smart enough
not to get caught!

183
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,130
Dirty Jew!

184
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,934
Grab him!

185
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,965
Let me out! What are you doing,
bastards? I'm one of you!

186
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,041
Quiet!

187
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,616
Now, we're starting our village
meeting.

188
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,126
If anybody got anything to say,
go ahead and sign in!

189
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,512
What are they doing there?

190
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,245
Quiet down!

191
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,925
Get out without children.

192
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,992
Right here, out of the window.

193
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,697
Leave the children.

194
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,502
Come on, move it!

195
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,584
Beasts!

196
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,446
Come on, get out.

197
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:39,166
Have you heard that he's taken up
command of a division?

198
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,607
That's great! Don'tyou think so?

199
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,917
Let go!

200
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,559
What a picture!

201
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,056
I'll kill you!

202
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,118
To the right.

203
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,492
Look! Empty! Empty!

204
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:53,232
Ah, piss-ass clerks, that's what
you are! The intelligentsia!

205
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,112
More gasoline.
Let it soak through.

206
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,352
Get up! Lead the cows!

207
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:11,153
You! March!
Go! Faster!

208
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,965
Faster, you bastard!

209
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,891
Petro, want some honey?

210
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:58,247
We'll leave you here, grandma...
to reproduce!

211
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,118
You make all of us some children.

212
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:40,066
To love... to have children...

213
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,528
Out of the way!

214
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,594
Move! Out of the way!

215
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,236
Wait!

216
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,039
Are you all crazy?!

217
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:36,381
You want to just kill them?..
Just like that?

218
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:40,682
They're all SS! Punitive detachment!
They lit the fire. We're not Germans!

219
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:42,318
Sit down!

220
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:43,925
They made us do everything.

221
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:50,927
Bastards! I lost my children
in that burning hell!

222
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:04,873
Rank and unit?

223
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:12,086
Walter Stein, SD Major.
15th Einsatzkommando.

224
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,351
That's the fuhrer.
He gave all the orders.

225
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,498
He's an old, sick man.

226
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,605
He never did any harm to anyone.

227
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,607
He is,

228
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:44,977
like his father was,
a man of principle.

229
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:55,461
He... he never harbored
any hatred of your people.

230
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:11,875
He's never killed anyone,
he wouldn't kill a fly.

231
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:20,520
Everyone here can confirm that,
and he hopes they will.

232
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:34,526
He's just a tired, old man.
"I want to quit."

233
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,897
That's what he's saying.

234
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:50,042
He wants to take care of his grand-
children. He's got grandkids like you.

235
00:59:56,225 --> 01:00:00,559
But this is war time, and it's
nobody's fault, this German says.

236
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,588
Swine! Dog!

237
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,567
A typical German!

238
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:12,698
Bastard! Shit!

239
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:16,074
He's the one...

240
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:23,075
He's the one who said: "Leave
the children.

241
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:29,585
You can come out,
but not the children".

242
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:35,292
He's a fascist! Executioner!

243
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:44,039
Yes, I said that: "Come out
and leave the children".

244
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,738
Translate it.

245
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:58,187
I said that because with the children
it starts all over again.

246
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:02,987
You've got no right to be.

247
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:10,122
Not every race
has a right to exist.

248
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,396
Listen!

249
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,629
Everyone, listen!

250
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,712
Inferior races
spread the contagion of communism.

251
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,420
You have no right to be.

252
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,162
And our mission will be accomplished.

253
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:43,956
If not today, tomorrow.

254
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,988
It isn't me. He's the one who said it!

255
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:11,391
We're not Germans!
We're not Germans!

256
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,054
We won't do it again!
Forgive us!

257
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,563
We're not Germans!

258
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:24,400
Not Germans! You've forgotten
what these dogs did?!

259
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:32,079
They're degenerates! They should be
killed! But we're not Germans...

260
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,017
Then who are you, you filthy slime?

261
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,152
They made us do it!

262
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,414
We're not Germans!
We're not Germans!

263
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:48,428
Death to the fascist bastards!
Make them pay! Kill them!

264
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:57,963
You'll do thatyourself.
And you'll pay like the Germans.

265
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,552
Give it to me! Give it!

266
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,379
I'm one of you!

267
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:17,252
Brothers, I'm one of you!

268
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:31,701
Comrade, let's light it!
Comrade, let me have a torch!

269
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,065
Out of the way!

270
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:21,677
The new one!

271
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,108
Come on, we're going!

272
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:06,399
626 VILLAGES IN BYELORUSSIA

273
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:10,402
WERE BURNT TO THE GROUND
WITH ALL THEIR INHABITANTS

274
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,131
Move it! Let's go!

275
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:47,288
The End
