1
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,816
This is the sad tale of
the township of Dogville.

2
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,737
Dogville was in the Rocky Mountains
in the US of A.

3
00:00:44,154 --> 00:00:50,660
Up here where the road came to its
definiteve end near the entrance to the old,
abandoned silver mine.

4
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:56,791
The residents of Dogville were good,
honest folks and they liked their township.

5
00:00:56,916 --> 00:01:02,171
And while a sentimental soul from the East Coast
had once dubbed their main street ELM STREET,

6
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:05,299
though no elm tree had ever
cast its shadow in Dogville,

7
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:08,803
they saw no reason to change anything.

8
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:14,809
Most of the buildings were pretty wretched;
more like shacks; frankly.

9
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:18,228
The house in which Tome lived
was the best, though,

10
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,108
and in good times might almost
have passed for presentable.

11
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:27,446
That afternoon the radio was playing softly,

12
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:35,704
for in his dotage Thomas Edison Senior
had developed a weakness for music of the lighter kind.

13
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:41,334
[Radio Presenter] Ladies and Gentlemen...
the President of the United States...

14
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:45,797
Tom, do me a favor, will you?
The radio!?

15
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:50,426
Just because the music's over and
you might risk hearing something useful?

16
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:54,013
I thought that's why we have the radio...

17
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:56,807
Well, I need a rest, as you know.

18
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,852
Mock me if you like.

19
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:05,357
[Narrator] Tom's father had been a doctor
and now received a modest pension,

20
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,196
so it was no great disaster for Tom
to drift about not doing anything in particular.

21
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:15,992
Tom was a writer.
...at any rate by his own lights.

22
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:22,707
Oh, his output as committed to paper
was so far limited to the words "great" and "small",

23
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:24,834
followed by question mark,

24
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:30,882
but nevertheless meticulously archived
in one of his many bureau drawers.

25
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:33,092
'Bye, Dad.

26
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:39,849
Evenin' Master Tom.

27
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,934
Good evening, Master Olivia.

28
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:43,769
Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow.

29
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:45,020
Noooo

30
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:55,906
[Narrator] In order to postpone the time
at which he would have to put pen to pater in earnest,

31
00:02:55,947 --> 00:03:00,910
Tom had now come up with
a series of meetings on moral rearmament

32
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:04,414
with which he felt obliged to benefit the town.

33
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:06,499
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Tom.

34
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:08,668
Good evening Chuck.

35
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:11,629
Will we see you at the meeting tomorrow?

36
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:14,131
Well, I could do without your lectures.

37
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:15,758
You know Vera.

38
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:19,261
Wouldn't give me moment's peace
till I said yes.

39
00:03:21,388 --> 00:03:24,975
Who gave Moses that bone?
It's still got meat on it.

40
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:26,894
Jason did.

41
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:29,563
Jason gave that mutt a bone
with meat on it?

42
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:32,816
When did we last see meat?

43
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:36,445
Next time you waste good food,
I'll take your knife away.

44
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:38,405
I would know it was you give'n meat to eat.

45
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,491
Moses was meant to be hungry! To keep watch.

46
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:43,660
Keep watch in Dogville?

47
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:46,204
What's there to steal?

48
00:03:46,246 --> 00:03:48,790
These are wicked time, Tom Edison.

49
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:52,585
Soon there'll be folks by
with even less than us.

50
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:04,138
[Narrator] Indeed..Tom was busy enough,
even though, formally speaking,

51
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:07,474
not yet busy with writing per se.

52
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:12,104
And if a body found it hard to grasp
what profession he was busy at,

53
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:15,148
he'd merely reply "mining".

54
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:18,235
For although he did not blast
his way through rock,

55
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:20,904
he blasted through what was even harder...

56
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:26,326
namely, the human soul...
right into where it glistered!

57
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,912
- Hey, Martha.
- Hello, Tom.

58
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:31,748
Listen, they're all comin',
so you just have those benches ready.

59
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:33,416
Yes, they're ready.

60
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:37,044
Oh, but Tom, I repeat,
if you need to use my organ

61
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:40,006
I got to get special permission
from the regional director, Tom.

62
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:43,134
Martha, and I repeat,
we don't need the organ.

63
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,637
We can be spiritual without singing
or reading from the Bible.

64
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:50,015
It's almost seven.
Don't forget your bell now.

65
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:53,894
I imagine that'll do Ma Ginger.

66
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:57,522
I don't think it's good for the soil
with all the raking and hoeing.

67
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:01,276
It's the soil that gave life to us all.

68
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:05,238
Don't give me any of your lip,
Thomas Edison Jr.

69
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,907
I'll hoe as I darn well please!

70
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:12,412
Yeah, and spoil the whole thing!
I agree with Tom.

71
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:14,831
Yeah, well he likes eating my pies,
don't you?

72
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,667
Well they're tasty.
No doubt about it.

73
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:20,753
Yeah. So when it comes to hoeing,
who's right, Tom, you or me?

74
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:22,922
I'm not so sure it's that simple.

75
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:24,799
He's got you there Ginger.

76
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:27,927
You can not resist,
can you, Gloria?

77
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,346
Hey, Ben, I'll get the doors!

78
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:31,555
I'll be fine, Tom.

79
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,058
Any news from the freight industry?

80
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:36,143
Is everything going to hell there too?

81
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:39,271
Don't poke fun at the freight industry.

82
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:48,363
[Narrator] It was seven o'clock precisely,
as Martha chimed the hour,

83
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:53,493
and Tom was due to play checkers
with his childhood friend Bill Henson.

84
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,329
Bill was dumb and knew it.

85
00:05:56,955 --> 00:06:02,418
Far too dumb to qualify as an engineer,
he was certainly sure of that.

86
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:10,885
After listening for a while to the piledriver
down the valley that Ben insisted was working
on the foundation of a new penitentiary,

87
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,847
Tom headed for the Henson home
in order to inflict upon Bill

88
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,642
yet another humiliating defeat at checkers.

89
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:26,817
Some folks might say the opportunity
to meet Bill's older sister, Liz, was more of a draw
than the checkerboard,

90
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:29,194
and they might be right.

91
00:06:29,778 --> 00:06:34,365
It was a fact that in the Henson home
lay another horizon.

92
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,078
A horizon just as alluring
as the one beyond the valley.

93
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:44,041
A horizon bound by Liz Henson's
luscious curves.

94
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:48,963
- No one's getting it?
- A sweet, painful, seductive abyss.

95
00:06:48,963 --> 00:06:50,756
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey, Tom.

96
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:54,885
Must you come by every single day?
Huh!?

97
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:58,097
It'd be a lot more fun if someone
interesting appeared for a change.

98
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:01,892
You know I really am so lonesome in this town.

99
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:07,105
The moment my fiancee writes
that he's gotten that job in Bolder, I'm off.

100
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,358
Then the whole lot of you will
have to find some other girls' skirts to peek up.

101
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,485
Is.. uh.. Bill in?

102
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:15,196
Well, isn't he always?

103
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:18,241
He studies and I help out with the glasses.

104
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:21,244
Even though everybody knows
that I'm the clever one.

105
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:24,455
- Hey, Mrs. Henson.
- Good evening, Tom.

106
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:27,750
Checkers time, Bill ol' Buddy.

107
00:07:29,502 --> 00:07:30,795
Was that..??

108
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:33,380
You didn't hear the bell?

109
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,261
[Narrator] As usual Bill tried to fake
his way around actually playing.

110
00:07:39,553 --> 00:07:44,266
He had not yet fully comprehend
this meeting business, he claimed.

111
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,102
Maybe you should just let them be?

112
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:48,770
I don't think so... I... I...

113
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:51,314
What if they're just fine as they are?

114
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:54,109
You think they're fine?
I don't think so.

115
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,277
I think there is a lot
this country has forgotten.

116
00:07:56,361 --> 00:08:00,281
I just try and refresh folk's memory
by way of illustration.

117
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,408
So... so the illustration for tomorrow?

118
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:04,869
mmmh.. I don't know.

119
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:10,291
See if the people of Dogville have
a problem with the acceptance.

120
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:13,961
What they really need is something
for them to accept,

121
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:17,923
something tangible,
like a gift.

122
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:22,386
Why in the heck would someone
up and give us a gift?

123
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:23,846
I don't know.

124
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,014
I might have to do some thinking.

125
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:33,396
Wait, wait, .. the ...
we're missing a piece.

126
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:35,941
We won't be able to play.

127
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:48,703
My mind is sharp tonight.

128
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:00,631
'Night, Bill.

129
00:09:15,937 --> 00:09:19,649
[Narrator] Despite considerable effort
on his part to prolong things,

130
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:23,528
Tom had achieved the triumph
at the checkerboard pretty quickly.

131
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:27,740
It had started to rain and
the wind had become a regular gale

132
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,868
when Tom strolled home through Elm Street.

133
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:38,000
If Tom were to prove that the citizens of Dogville
had a problem receiving in his lecture in the next day

134
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:42,504
he sorely lacked an illustration,
a gift.

135
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:44,757
Bill might have been right.

136
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:49,470
It hadn't exactly rained gifts
on this particular township.

137
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:30,050
There was no doubt in his mind.

138
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:32,344
They were gun shots.

139
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:36,473
The pile driver in the marshes
didn't sound like that at all.

140
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:38,767
The shots had come from down in the valley,

141
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:42,979
or perhaps from Canyon Road some place
in the direction of Georgetown.

142
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:51,321
He listened for more shots for ages.
But they were not repeated.

143
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:58,911
A tad disappointed, Tom sat down
on the old lady's bench to think,

144
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:02,623
to hang onto the feeling of danger
for a moment.

145
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:08,629
But it wasn't long before his thoughts
were back on his favorite subjects again,

146
00:11:08,754 --> 00:11:14,801
and in the midst of the storm they metamorphosed
into articles and novels and great gatherings

147
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:23,268
that'd listen in silence to Tom after the publication
of yet another volume that scourged and purged the human soul.

148
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:27,647
And he saw men,
and among them even other writers,

149
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:34,487
throw their arms round one another as,
through his words, life had opened up for them anew.

150
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,031
It hadn't been easy.

151
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:44,121
But by his diligence and application
to narrative and drama his message had gotten through,

152
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,668
and asked about his technique he would
have to say but one word:

153
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,713
"illustration".

154
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,526
Tom could have spent another
half hour or more on the bench,

155
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,363
but another unusual noise roused him.

156
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,033
It was Moses barking.

157
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:27,204
Oh, that wasn't unusual in itself,
but it was the way he barked that was new.

158
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,833
His barking was not loud,
but more of a snarl,

159
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:37,256
as if the danger was quite close at hand
and not merely a passing raccoon or fox.

160
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:44,554
as if the dog were standing face to face
with a force to be taken seriously.

161
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:50,852
Hey, Lady!
I wouldn't go up there if I were you.

162
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:57,984
I know the mountain well,
I doubt if I'd get away with my life.

163
00:12:58,067 --> 00:12:59,986
It's a very nasty drop.

164
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:08,160
Is there another way?

165
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:09,995
Yeah.

166
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,167
Where?

167
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:20,339
Back down the way you came from.
Back down to Georgetown.

168
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:23,425
Why do you need to get out of the mountain?

169
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:26,762
Did you have anything to do
with those gunshots?

170
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,103
Help me, help me please.

171
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,689
You can hide in the mine,
in there!

172
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:48,407
Hey, where's this road headed to?

173
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:50,618
No where. It's a dead end.

174
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:55,039
If you want to pass, turn around,
go back by way of Georgetown.

175
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,958
This place... uh..
it's called Dogville.

176
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,503
Dogville? Well it figures,
it's a stupid name if I ever heard one.

177
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,590
Hey, we're looking for somebody...

178
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,591
Oh, really, who might that be?

179
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:11,137
My boss wants to talk to ya.

180
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:13,515
- Young man.
- Yes, sir.

181
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:19,812
I'm looking for a girl. She may have made
her way to your town in her confusion.

182
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:24,859
I don't want any harm to come to her.
You see, she's very precious to me.

183
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:28,321
Well sir, uh..
nobody's been through Dogville recently.

184
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:32,241
Moses would have barked.
He's very suspicious of strangers.

185
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:36,495
Ah ha.. That's very wise Moses.

186
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:43,669
Please take my card and if perhaps..
uh.. you see a stranger,

187
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:45,462
give me a call.

188
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:49,758
I am in a position to offer
a considerable reward.

189
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,761
Yes sir. Thank you.

190
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:56,681
uh.. say was it you that fired those shots?

191
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:16,450
Well they're gone.
You want to come out now?

192
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:29,546
You want a cup of coffee
before you go mountain-climbing?

193
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,885
That would be nice.

194
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:41,307
[Narrator] The beautiful fugitive's name was Grace.

195
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:46,646
She hadn't chosen Dogville from a map
or sought out the township for a visit,

196
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:50,900
yet Tom felt right away that she belonged.

197
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,653
Shall I take the bone?

198
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:02,661
[Narrator] She could have kept
her vulnerability to herself,

199
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:06,999
but she had elected to give herself up
to him at random.

200
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:12,504
As.. yes.. a gift.

201
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:16,758
"Generous, very generous",
thought Tom.

202
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:23,390
You want to eat?
You must be hungry?

203
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:24,891
I can't.

204
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,645
I don't deserve that bread!

205
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,525
I stole that bone.
I haven't stolen anything before.

206
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:39,405
So now, now I have to punish myself.

207
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:46,745
I was raised to be arrogant,
so I had to teach myself these things.

208
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:53,877
Well, it may be best for your education...

209
00:16:54,878 --> 00:17:00,217
Grace, in this town in these times...

210
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:05,138
it is very impolite not to eat
what's set before you.

211
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:09,350
I'm so sorry.

212
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:24,448
Who were the men in the car?
Why would they want to hurt you?

213
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:31,872
The man in the back of the car,
he's the boss. I saw his face.

214
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:37,586
He gave me his telephone number,
told me to call if I saw you.

215
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:42,424
I'm sure he'd offered you a big reward
if you told him where I was.

216
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:43,800
Yeah.

217
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,931
Where's your family?

218
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:51,808
I don't have a family.

219
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:54,519
All I had was a father...

220
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,942
but those gangsters took him away from me.

221
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,528
What if I said you could stay here?

222
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:05,988
Here?

223
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,450
But even if you meant it, it's impossible.

224
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:17,082
It's very small town, I have to hide.
People will ask questions.

225
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:21,795
Well, it might not matter.
Not if they all wanted to help you too.

226
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,966
Are you saying that everybody
in this town is like you?

227
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:30,720
They're good people.
You know, they're honest people.

228
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,264
They've all been in need themselves.

229
00:18:33,348 --> 00:18:36,059
They might well turn you down, but...

230
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:39,729
I think it would be worth the trouble to ask.

231
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:42,982
But I got nothing to offer them in return.

232
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:46,902
No, I think you have plenty to offer Dogville.

233
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:59,539
[Narrator] To call the mood of the audience
at Tom's morale lecture in the mission house the next day,

234
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:04,836
"enthusiastic" would have been going to far,
but they had come.

235
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:10,592
And Tom had launched himself fearlessly
into his endeavor to illustrate the human problem:

236
00:19:10,675 --> 00:19:12,677
To receive.

237
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:22,687
The subject was obvious, but quite
dreadfully ill-considered by this young man.

238
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:27,525
To compensate for his lack of preparation
Tom made diligent use of his technique

239
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:31,820
of lashing out somewhat haphazardly
in all directions.

240
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:36,450
His father peered around covertly
to gauge the mood,

241
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,580
and sensing that the assembly was not
entirely happy with this rather direct criticism,

242
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:44,666
he decided to forestall any protest.

243
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,752
Now I'm sure that you wish us well, Tom,

244
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:53,466
but um.. of any town, I believe this one has
a very fine sense of community.

245
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:56,344
Living side by side we all know one another.

246
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:58,346
I'm a pretty fair judge of character myself.

247
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:01,099
Honestly, Tom, you've done it again.

248
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,643
Made us come here to listen
to a lot of nonsense.

249
00:20:03,976 --> 00:20:06,896
What do you think you are,
some kind of philosopher?

250
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,773
Observant, that's what I am.

251
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:12,735
Lazy, I would say.
We shovel snow together.

252
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:14,528
We shovel snow together?

253
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,362
Yeah.

254
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:18,323
Every household clears their own front walk.

255
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:23,203
Yeah, I gotta allow that Tom's right on that.
If roads don't get
cleared properly...

256
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:28,750
I'm sorry Tom, you're going to have to
come up with something better than that.

257
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:34,422
But the whole country would be better served
with a greater attitude of openness and accenpance.

258
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:37,884
You're suggesting that we all
wouldn't help out if someone needed help.

259
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:39,594
No, that's not the point.
That's not the point.

260
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:40,929
We care for human beings up here.

261
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:44,182
We would probably never find out.

262
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:52,857
Since nobody seems to want to admit
that there's a problem,

263
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:56,443
let me illustrate.

264
00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:01,907
Now I'm not going to use something
that's already happened.

265
00:21:03,283 --> 00:21:06,828
I'm going to use something
that's just about to happen.

266
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:16,546
[Narrator] And, after providing a quick summary
of the events of the previous evening
to the astonished people of Dogville,

267
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:22,635
Tom went down to the mine to retrieve
the fugitive from her hideaway.

268
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:36,565
Allow me to introduce Grace.
Grace, these are the citizens of Dogville.

269
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:39,109
- Hello.
- Hello.

270
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:45,282
Tom has told us about your predicament, Miss.

271
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:48,118
I really don't want to put any of you
in jeopardy.

272
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:49,911
Why don't you just go to the police?

273
00:21:49,953 --> 00:21:53,665
They can take care of gangsters!
It's their job.

274
00:21:53,665 --> 00:21:58,628
I, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
The transportation
business would uh...

275
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,212
Ben!

276
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:08,179
These men, they have powerful connections,
even with the police.

277
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:11,224
Do you think we should give
sanctuary to a fugitive?

278
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:16,395
A fugitive that gangsters wanna get a hold of.
That would put us in pretty pickle.

279
00:22:16,437 --> 00:22:18,189
Easy, Claire...
think of your asthma.

280
00:22:18,189 --> 00:22:20,983
Dogville is a good place to hide,
that's for certain.

281
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:24,028
Exactly.
The only way up here is Canyon Road.

282
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:31,201
That could easily be watched by Ma Ginger's
-excuse me-nosey cousin who lives
only yards from the turn off.

283
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:34,329
She has a telephone.
Martha, you could ring the bell,

284
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:36,832
tell the town if people were coming.

285
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:43,088
But Tom, I chime the hours,
what if people get confused with all the ringing?

286
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:47,467
Come now, Martha.
Surely we can use our old bell to save a life, if need be.

287
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:49,886
Why should we?

288
00:22:50,344 --> 00:22:53,472
Because we care, Chuck.
We care for other human beings.

289
00:22:53,514 --> 00:22:55,057
No, that ain't what I mean.

290
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,519
How do we know that this woman is
telling us the truth?

291
00:22:58,561 --> 00:23:03,440
Maybe these gangsters did shoot at her,
but that don't make her somebody to be trusted.

292
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:08,821
He is right.
Why would you trust me?

293
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,989
I trust you!

294
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:13,992
Tom, we're not gangsters.

295
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:19,372
We mind our own business
we don't ask nothin' from nobody.

296
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,167
So at last you admit it!

297
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:27,505
If only there were some way,
we wouldn't doubt the young lady's word.

298
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,007
some way to know her..

299
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:31,384
Then I think we would all ignore the risk.

300
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:35,388
But there is a way!
You said it yourself.

301
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:38,307
By living side by side with her.

302
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:41,519
Dad, you are such a fine judge of character.

303
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,022
How long would it take a good man
like you to unmask her?

304
00:23:45,147 --> 00:23:48,859
A week? Maybe two?

305
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:51,528
Surely we can offer her two weeks.

306
00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:56,450
And if after that time so much as
one man cries out 'BE GONE!'

307
00:23:56,491 --> 00:24:00,370
I promise I'll happily send her
packing herself.

308
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:12,507
Well, if Master Tom thinks this is right
for us, and for the
community,

309
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:19,138
then that will do for me.
He might be young, but his heart is right.

310
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:22,892
And I've known his heart
for as long las it's been beating.

311
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:36,321
[Narrator] No more words were spoken
at the town meeting in the mission house.

312
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:42,494
But it had been decided, they all felt,
that the fugitive would be given two weeks.

313
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:45,914
And they would all be able to look
at themselves in the mirror and know

314
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:52,587
that they had done what they could, indeed,
and perhaps more than most people would have done.

315
00:24:54,797 --> 00:25:03,514
So that very afternoon Tom took Grace on a stroll
down Elm Street to introduce her to the town "he loved".

316
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:08,352
Well, this is where Olivia and June live.

317
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:14,274
June is a cripple...
They live here as a token of my dad's broadmindedness.

318
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:18,320
Chuck and Vera have seven children
and they hate each other.

319
00:25:18,695 --> 00:25:26,995
Next door we have the Hensons.
They make a living from grinding edges off
cheap glasses to try to make them look expensive.

320
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:32,417
And here we have Jack McKay.
Now, Jack McKay is blind and the whole town knows it.

321
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:37,213
But he thinks he can hide it
by never leaving his house.

322
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:39,715
In the old stable Ben keeps his truck.

323
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:46,597
He drinks and he visits the whorehouse
once a month and he is ashamed of it.

324
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:53,479
Martha she runs the mission house
until the new preacher comes which will just never happen.

325
00:25:54,355 --> 00:26:00,986
That leaves Ma Ginger and Gloria.
They run this really expensive store,

326
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:05,240
where they exploit the fact
that nobody leaves town.

327
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,078
Used to leave to go vote,
but since they put on the registration fee,

328
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:17,043
about a day's wage for these people,
they don't feel the democratic need any more.

329
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:25,009
Those awful figurines say more about
the people in this town, than many words.

330
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:29,555
If this is the town that you love,
then you really have a strange way of showing it.

331
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:40,732
All I see, is a beautiful little town
in the midst of magnificent mountains.

332
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:50,075
A place where people have hopes
and dreams even under the hardest conditions.

333
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:56,498
And seven figurines that are not awful at all.

334
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,253
[Narrator] Calling Dogville beautiful was
original at least.

335
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:10,344
Grace was just casting one more look
at the figurines she herself would have dismissed
as tasteless a few days earlier,

336
00:27:10,636 --> 00:27:19,520
when she suddenly sensed
what would best have been described
as a tiny change of light over Dogville.

337
00:27:40,707 --> 00:27:43,793
They are keeping an eye on you.

338
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:48,923
If you love them already,
they might need a little persuading.

339
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:53,761
You've got two weeks
to get them to accept you.

340
00:27:54,178 --> 00:27:57,056
You make it sound like
we are playing a game.

341
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:05,731
It is. We are. Isn't saving your life
worth a little game?

342
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:07,691
What do you want me to do?

343
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:09,818
Do you mind physical labour?

344
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:12,028
No!

345
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:16,283
Dogville has offered you two weeks.

346
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:19,911
now you offer them...

347
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:38,554
[Narrator] The next day was
a beautiful day in Dogville.

348
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:42,766
The tender leaves on Ma Ginger's
goosberry bushes were unfurling

349
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:47,604
despite wise Tom's misgivings
as regards her gardening methods.

350
00:28:47,938 --> 00:28:56,613
But more than that, this first day of spring
had also benn picked to be Grace's first ever day of work.

351
00:28:56,696 --> 00:29:03,995
The day in which she was to set off around
Dogville and ofeer herself one hour per household per day.

352
00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:05,246
Excuse me.

353
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:13,462
I would like to offer you my help..
if there is anything that you need?

354
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,510
Yeah.. A carburetor that don't leak..

355
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:24,640
alright here, let me take that.

356
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,267
Maybe I could help around your home?

357
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:35,108
I don't really have a home.
Just the garage.

358
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:40,363
I'm in the freight business.
The road is my home!

359
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,449
I'm ready. Good morning!

360
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,451
Miss Olivia has got a home.

361
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,913
She is looking to help out
in somebody's home.

362
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,457
A cleanin' lady for a cleanin' lady?

363
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,336
You be talkin' nonsense, Mister Ben!

364
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,712
Have a good day!

365
00:29:56,754 --> 00:30:00,091
Alright. See ya later on!

366
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:04,887
[Narrator] And off Ben went to Georgetown
with the weekly shipment of glasses

367
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:11,643
that Mr. Henson had so laboriously cleansed
with his polisher of any trace of their cheap manufacture.

368
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:22,070
So Grace turned into the alley
which went by the exotic name, Glunen Street

369
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:28,243
to knock on the door of the blind,
but only too vain, man.

370
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,079
Yes?

371
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,750
Good morning, Mr. McKay.
My name is Grace.

372
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:40,296
I was wondering if there is anything
I can do for you?

373
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,758
Oh, that's very kind of you, Grace,
but...

374
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:48,470
I was thinking that perhaps because of
the situation that you are in...

375
00:30:49,096 --> 00:30:51,515
What situation am I in?

376
00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:59,606
Hmm... You are.. on your own.

377
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:06,613
Oh, I have been on my own for so long.

378
00:31:07,238 --> 00:31:09,574
Anything that you might need?

379
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:12,869
I'm sorry!

380
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:19,125
Have you ever noticed the wooden spire
on the roof of the mission house?

381
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:26,507
At 5 o'clock in the afternoon, it points
a shadow at Ginger's grocery store,

382
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:34,014
right at the O in OPEN
on the sign in the window.

383
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,810
Maybe it is telling people that it is time
to go shopping for supper.

384
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,522
Goodbye, Mr. McKay.

385
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:45,483
Bye, Grace!

386
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:51,614
[Narrator] Grace's interview with Jack McKay
proved sadly
symptomatic of the attitude in Dogville.

387
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:57,245
Reserved but friendly,
not without curiosity.

388
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:03,626
Only Jack had expressed his "no"
consicely and precisely:

389
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:09,173
Martha needed a monologue almost
an hour long to arrive at the same conclusion.

390
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:12,843
Oh my goodness... I, I, I'd have to think of
work for you to do,

391
00:32:12,885 --> 00:32:15,345
because I have barely enough work myself.

392
00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:20,851
[Narrator] So not very much later Grace had
ended up next to Ma Ginger's gooseberry bushes

393
00:32:20,892 --> 00:32:24,646
in a mood that was not particularly good.

394
00:32:26,106 --> 00:32:29,192
She could not tell a gooseberry bush
from a cactus,

395
00:32:29,276 --> 00:32:32,946
but the meticulous order in the yard
appealed to her,

396
00:32:33,238 --> 00:32:37,533
such as the metal chains placed there
in order to shield the second and third bushes,

397
00:32:37,617 --> 00:32:44,123
lest anybody decided to make use of
the deplorably time-honored shortcut to the old lady's bency.

398
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:49,879
Grace pulled herself together and
headed towards the store.

399
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:54,049
Hello!

400
00:32:55,259 --> 00:33:00,722
Hello. We don't need any help here either.
I told that to Tom.

401
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:05,227
Wow, it doesn't matter anyway,
because there is nothing I can do.

402
00:33:05,394 --> 00:33:07,896
I have never worked a day in my life, so.

403
00:33:11,608 --> 00:33:16,738
You know, if you put some aloe on
those hands of yours they'll be better by morning.

404
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:20,408
It's the wood shavings.
I really do hate them.

405
00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:24,245
But I do believe I'll take your advice.

406
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:27,748
Your hands are surely the most
alabaster hands I've ever seen.

407
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,085
Here comes Tom, how lucky we are.

408
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:37,299
Hi, all. Grace.. how is all going?

409
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:39,760
- Not very well, I'm afraid.
- Really?

410
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,887
No. Nobody needs any help.

411
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:44,389
Well, I thought that might be the case.

412
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:49,770
His plan to make everybody like me
has run into a few problems

413
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:52,188
because nobody wants me to work for them.

414
00:33:52,188 --> 00:33:55,275
I would really like to offer something in return.

415
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:59,529
You're all running a terrible risk
having me here.

416
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,782
I mean, I am willing to learn.

417
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:07,495
There must be someone who needs help.
Mr. McKay's sight is not good.

418
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:12,083
Yes, I went to Mr. McKay.
I went to Martha and to Chuck and Vera's,

419
00:34:12,124 --> 00:34:14,710
and nobody seems to need any help.

420
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:17,796
They all think everyone else needs
something, and not themselves.

421
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,884
Funny, that's exactly what Tom said.
I supposed he's pleased.

422
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:29,057
Just to prove him wrong,
maybe you can lend a hand here.

423
00:34:29,808 --> 00:34:33,061
But Ginger, there really isn't anything
we need done.

424
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:35,397
Perhaps there's something
you don't need done?

425
00:34:35,939 --> 00:34:37,649
Anything we don't need done?

426
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:43,613
Something.. something that you would like
done, but that you don't think is necessay.

427
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,740
What on earth would that be?

428
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:48,117
Maybe... maybe the gooseberry bushes.

429
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,661
The gooseberries are just fine,
thank you very much.

430
00:34:50,828 --> 00:34:54,957
No. Not yours. The ones that planted
themselves in the tall grass.

431
00:34:55,624 --> 00:34:57,126
We don't grow anything there.

432
00:34:57,168 --> 00:35:00,879
Exactly. A bit of tiding up.

433
00:35:01,213 --> 00:35:05,259
Who knows, those bushes might
one day bear fruit.

434
00:35:05,342 --> 00:35:08,387
Yeah. That's true! Who knows..

435
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,138
All right, girl.

436
00:35:11,306 --> 00:35:18,271
Those alabaster hands of yours are
hereby engaged to weed the wild gooseberry bushes.

437
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:20,690
Thank you!

438
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:25,028
Around.. like this, you see.

439
00:35:25,904 --> 00:35:29,198
Anything to close them...
just be careful, that's all.

440
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:35,079
[Narrator] After a few of the wild little
gooseberry bushes had given up the ghost

441
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:39,625
in the care of Grace's as yet
unpracticed alabaster hands,

442
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:44,463
things began looking up
with the weeding and the town.

443
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:54,181
In fact it turned out there were not so few things
that the other townsfold of Dogville didn't need doing either.

444
00:35:55,098 --> 00:36:01,646
As Ben had no home, Grace's domestic
experiments were absolutely things he didn't need,

445
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:08,987
but he put up with them anyhow,
appearing with astonishing punctuality
when the act of domesticity had been completed,

446
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:14,242
no matter how unpredictable business
hours in the freight industry might otherwise have been.

447
00:36:17,912 --> 00:36:22,750
Olivia didn't need anyone to help June
to the toilet while she was at work,

448
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:28,797
as hitherto they had coped splendidly
with Olivia's excellent diaper arrangement.

449
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:37,722
If Jack McKay had needed a partner
for conversation he would surely have gone out
and gotten one for himself in the town.

450
00:36:38,014 --> 00:36:43,061
So it was not out of need that he allowed
Grace to sit with him in his dark parlor

451
00:36:43,103 --> 00:36:51,653
with the dramatic drapes on one wall
for lengthy discussions regarding
the underestimated qualities of the light on the East Coast.

452
00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:59,243
As Martha wouldn't dream of burdening
the parish with wear and tear of the pedals and bellows,

453
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:05,291
while waiting for the new priest to be appointed,
she practiced without a note ever leaving the organ,

454
00:37:05,332 --> 00:37:09,837
and was therefore not really
in need of anyone to turn her pages.

455
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:17,052
And God knows that Mr. and Mrs. Henson's son
did not need any help with his books,

456
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:21,765
and that the family had taken Grace
for her own sake.

457
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:31,065
And although Liz's hands had improved
through Grace's good counsel,

458
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:36,696
Thomas Edison was a doctor and
of indisputable health and he did not need care,

459
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,992
or help with the pills from the medicine
closet with its many secrets.

460
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:49,792
Actually Chuck was the only one
"not yet hooked", as Tom put it.

461
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:56,173
Hooked? You sound so arrogant!
Arrogance is the worst thing!

462
00:37:56,465 --> 00:37:58,300
He doesn't like me.

463
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:02,095
And he has every right to feel that way.

464
00:38:02,137 --> 00:38:08,268
Yeah. Listen!
Luckily I have prepared a Trojan horse.

465
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:09,769
A what?

466
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:12,647
Trojan horse.
We can get in by way of Vera.

467
00:38:12,772 --> 00:38:21,489
There is this.. lecture tomorrow
in Georgetown, given by some professor.

468
00:38:21,614 --> 00:38:25,785
Some intellectual thing.

469
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,831
But not so intellectual he can't tour
the provinces with it, anyway, the point is,

470
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:36,545
Vera she would do anything to go,
but she's got no one to mind Achilles while she is gone.

471
00:38:36,753 --> 00:38:42,509
She trusts the girls mastering their iambs
and pentameters, but not with the little one.

472
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:47,889
So this is where you come in.
I said that you could watch him tomorrow afternoon.

473
00:38:48,014 --> 00:38:54,938
Now, I will try and stall her on her way home
and with a bit of luck, Chuck'll get back before she does

474
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:59,692
and you can use the time and
all your charm to try and win him over.

475
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:03,321
I'll happily mind Achilles if Vera will let me.

476
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:06,824
But if he doesn't like me he doesn't like me.

477
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:12,955
[Narrator] Tom really was enchanted by this
unusual, mysterious creature.

478
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:18,710
And even though she did not satisfy
his curiosity by saying
anything about her past

479
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:28,303
so as not to put anyone in danger,
she still fitted Tom's mission to educate Dogville
on the subject of acceptance like a glove.

480
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:31,014
Tom felt content.

481
00:39:31,014 --> 00:39:36,728
Grace had been dangling over the edge,
and he had been the one to pull her back onto the path.

482
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:43,025
It gave him a fine sensation of mastery,
new for him in terms of the opposite sex,

483
00:39:43,192 --> 00:39:47,947
and his feelings unleashed the best
in his burgeoning love.

484
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:10,302
Hello. This is Dahlia, Olympia, Diana,
Athena, Pandora, Jason, Achilles.

485
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,391
Your children are lovely.

486
00:40:16,516 --> 00:40:23,606
They are good kids. And I love them.

487
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:34,158
Please don't say any such nice things
about the kids. I cry too easily.

488
00:40:36,076 --> 00:40:38,829
Both in sorrow and in joy.

489
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,749
- Hey, Vera.
- Oh, hi!

490
00:40:42,124 --> 00:40:44,251
- Shall we go?
- I'm ready.

491
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:46,920
Thanks for leaving the map out.

492
00:40:47,004 --> 00:40:51,133
I'd a plum forgot it, I'm sure.
How did you know I was going that far?

493
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:56,137
The last time I saw the thermos,
it was on the doorstep and the map was beside it,

494
00:40:56,137 --> 00:41:01,476
so I just thought, when I saw the thermos
this time and no map, but...

495
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,105
You are a sweet girl, Grace.

496
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,524
Sweet as Miss Laura.

497
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:10,151
Who's Miss Laura?

498
00:41:10,193 --> 00:41:12,653
You gave yourself again, Ben.

499
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:17,366
I think Miss Laura is
what Ovid might call a Maenad.

500
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,373
Oh, don't be ashamed, Ben.

501
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:28,126
We all have the right to make the most of our lives.

502
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:33,840
I'm sure that those ladies in those houses
they bring a lot of joy to a lot of men.

503
00:41:35,217 --> 00:41:40,930
Ain't nothing I'm proud of.
It really ain't.

504
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:00,908
I know what you are doing here.

505
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,911
You do?

506
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:09,708
You want people to like you,
so you don't have to go away.

507
00:42:11,335 --> 00:42:13,086
You are very smart.

508
00:42:15,505 --> 00:42:18,258
Yes, I like it here in Dogville.

509
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,930
Do you want me to read to you?
About the Cyclops?

510
00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:27,225
I don't like the Cyclops.

511
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:34,315
Two eyes are pretties, like yours.

512
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:45,075
If you want my Ma to like you, and let you stay.
You'll just have to be nice to me.

513
00:42:47,953 --> 00:42:50,330
Maybe you should help me clean up instead.

514
00:42:50,706 --> 00:42:55,627
Ma says I don't have to work,
'cept in my head.

515
00:42:55,794 --> 00:42:59,798
Oh, but what about if I ask you, please?

516
00:43:00,006 --> 00:43:00,966
Ok.

517
00:43:15,313 --> 00:43:16,647
What are you doing here?

518
00:43:16,772 --> 00:43:19,275
Didn't I tell you we don't need
no help from you?

519
00:43:19,317 --> 00:43:21,277
Ma asked her to mind me and Achilles.

520
00:43:21,277 --> 00:43:24,488
Quiet! Get out! The lot of you.

521
00:43:27,324 --> 00:43:29,076
The same nonsense!

522
00:43:29,743 --> 00:43:32,663
They'd have done just great in Antiquity,
no doubt.

523
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:37,459
How is it going otherwise,
with the fooling act?

524
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:43,173
I wasn't trying to fool anyone?

525
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:48,011
I mean Dogville.
Has it got you fooled yet?

526
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:55,226
I thought you were implying
that I was trying to exploit the town.

527
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:57,812
Wishful thinking.

528
00:43:59,814 --> 00:44:03,734
This town is rotten from the inside out,

529
00:44:04,276 --> 00:44:07,154
and I wouldn't miss it,
if it fell into the gorge tomorrow.

530
00:44:07,613 --> 00:44:15,204
I see no charm here, but you seem to.

531
00:44:15,704 --> 00:44:18,832
Admit it you've fallen for Dogville.

532
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,129
The trees, the mountains,
the simple folk.

533
00:44:24,713 --> 00:44:28,049
And if all that ain't got you fooled yet,
I bet the cinnamon has.

534
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,136
That damned cinnamon
in those gooseberry pies.

535
00:44:33,012 --> 00:44:36,641
Dogville has everything that you ever
dreamed of in the big city.

536
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:42,021
You are worse than Tom.
How do you know what I dreamed of?

537
00:44:46,692 --> 00:44:49,486
You're from the city yourself, aren't you?

538
00:44:49,612 --> 00:44:51,447
That was a long time ago.

539
00:44:51,697 --> 00:44:55,325
I am not that stupid anymore,
I found out that people are the same all over.

540
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,910
Greedy as animals.

541
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,622
In a small town they're just a bit
less successful.

542
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:03,500
Feed 'em enough they'll eat
till their bellies burst.

543
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,752
That's why you wanted to get rid of me...

544
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:11,257
because you can't stand that I remind
you of what it was you came here to find.

545
00:45:19,307 --> 00:45:21,434
I'm telling you for the last time
to get out of my home.

546
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:23,728
Moses don't like you.
And I don't like you.

547
00:45:24,228 --> 00:45:26,856
The kids are going crazy enough
from their ma's teachin'.

548
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:28,566
Thank you, Grace!

549
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:51,963
[Narrator] The two seeks had passed far too quickly.
Grace had enjoyed herself.

550
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:56,009
All she could say was that
she was fond of them all,

551
00:45:56,092 --> 00:46:00,680
including the folk who had greeted her
with reluctance and hostility.

552
00:46:01,097 --> 00:46:07,144
Even though she might not have won everybody
over completely or even half way, as Tom put it,

553
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:14,068
She cared for Dogville and she had shown
the town her face, her true face.

554
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,528
But was that enough?

555
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:23,410
During Jack McKay's long lecture that evening
she had found herself in a heart-searching mood.

556
00:46:23,827 --> 00:46:27,914
Whether heart-searching or
concern for her future was the cause,

557
00:46:27,998 --> 00:46:36,506
the result was that the otherwise so lovable
Grace indulged in a pretty shady piece of provocation.

558
00:46:36,506 --> 00:46:45,556
So you agree that the windows of St. Bridget's,
at the first time you saw them,
didn't live up to their reputation.

559
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:52,021
I don't think it is the position of the church itself.

560
00:46:52,146 --> 00:47:02,990
Maybe it's the light in Los Angeles and
the mosaic glass in those windows they kind of collide,

561
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:07,244
I remember thinking that.

562
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:13,708
I think we've talked long enough about
the way we remembering seeing things.

563
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:15,126
Don't you?

564
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:22,759
Why don't we talk about something
that we can see right now?

565
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:29,056
There is not much to see around here.
Wretched town.

566
00:47:30,391 --> 00:47:32,518
Why don't we talk about the view?

567
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:45,322
I don't go out much.
The sun and my skin.

568
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:48,617
Yesterday I was walking in Chuck's apple trees.

569
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:57,459
If you go right up to the edge of the cliff
you just manage to peer round Ben's garage

570
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:01,129
and you get a view of your house
from the side facing the gorge.

571
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:07,593
I didn't realize that there was windows behind there.

572
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:15,017
Huge windows.
There must be a wonderful view.

573
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,021
Would you mind if I opened them?

574
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:06,942
You're no fool, Miss Grace.
You're no fool.

575
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:12,656
You probably see that those curtains
are hard to open.

576
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:13,824
Sorry!

577
00:49:16,701 --> 00:49:23,291
And obviously concluded that it's because
they're not used very often.

578
00:49:25,543 --> 00:49:32,091
But the view's good, entrancing even.

579
00:49:35,928 --> 00:49:47,731
So, ask me, why a man who loves the light
hang these heavy curtains?

580
00:49:54,947 --> 00:49:59,367
Yes, I'm blind.

581
00:49:59,826 --> 00:50:06,958
Not weak sighted, not myopic: blind.

582
00:50:09,252 --> 00:50:20,680
So please go
and let me be that on my own.

583
00:50:27,353 --> 00:50:36,570
Is Switzerland they call it the Alpengulen.

584
00:50:37,988 --> 00:50:42,951
That's the light that reflects
from the highest peaks

585
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:48,456
after the sun goes down behind the mountains.

586
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:52,543
But now it's gone.

587
00:51:16,817 --> 00:51:21,988
[Narrator] It was in complete silence
that the people of Dogville turned up for the meeting
at the mission house

588
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:26,159
two weeks to the day since the beautiful
fugitive had come to town.

589
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:32,582
Grace was standing beside Tom,
watching them convene,

590
00:51:32,665 --> 00:51:39,881
and knew inside herself that this might well be
the last time she would see these now so familiar faces.

591
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:45,594
She had at least two of them against her,
and even one would have been too many.

592
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:49,640
Welcome good people of Dogville.

593
00:51:49,682 --> 00:51:57,314
Two weeks.... two weeks have passed
and it is time for your verdict.

594
00:51:57,689 --> 00:52:01,652
Is it right that she should be here while we talk?

595
00:52:01,693 --> 00:52:05,989
Well, Mrs. Henson, when Grace first came
she made no attempt to hide her weakness from us.

596
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:14,205
So I think it is only right we be as open
with her, tell her to her face if we want her to leave.

597
00:52:14,747 --> 00:52:16,874
No, Mrs. Henson is right.

598
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:22,421
Nobody should be prevented from
speaking their mind out of politeness.

599
00:52:23,506 --> 00:52:25,383
I'll wait at the mine.

600
00:52:26,008 --> 00:52:32,973
And if the vote says that I should leave,
then I'll take the path across the mountains, while it's still light.

601
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:37,936
And the things I've borrowed, if you could,
return them to everybody.

602
00:52:38,062 --> 00:52:39,062
Of course!

603
00:52:39,062 --> 00:52:41,607
Nobody has to see me before I go.

604
00:52:42,065 --> 00:52:45,610
Martha, if you will just ring the bell
then I'll understand.

605
00:52:45,944 --> 00:52:48,947
I don't ... how do...
am I gonna ring the bell?

606
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:53,284
Just ring it for every vote that lets me stay.

607
00:52:53,618 --> 00:53:00,375
I will count. And if it doesn't reach
fifteen, then I'll leave.

608
00:53:09,216 --> 00:53:15,055
Tom is anxious to speak in her behalf,
but I think he's had his allotted time.

609
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:20,561
We know his view. We respect it.
And now he must respect ours.

610
00:53:21,603 --> 00:53:26,400
[Narrator] Grace pulled her bundle out from
under the bureau to change into her own clothes,

611
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:31,154
only to discover that somebody had been
in it and left a loaf of bread.

612
00:53:33,156 --> 00:53:35,950
Next to it was a folded sheet of paper.

613
00:53:36,076 --> 00:53:38,912
It was a map Tom had drawn.

614
00:53:38,912 --> 00:53:42,582
He had known where the bundle was
and had put it there.

615
00:53:42,624 --> 00:53:45,001
It showed the path across the mountain.

616
00:53:45,043 --> 00:53:50,423
And all the dangerous spots were
furnished with witty horrific little sketches.

617
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:53,926
But there was more.

618
00:53:54,009 --> 00:54:00,516
Several people had the same idea.
They had eased gifts into the bundle for her.

619
00:54:00,557 --> 00:54:05,437
Jason's beloved little penknife lay there,
all polished and shiny.

620
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:11,651
And a pie from Ma Ginger and Gloria.
And some clothing and matches, and a hymnal.

621
00:54:12,027 --> 00:54:17,449
Grace opened it at number 18, where Martha
always had trouble with fingering.

622
00:54:18,867 --> 00:54:25,581
And between the pages lay a dollar bill
Martha alone could not have afforded it.

623
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:30,962
Grace had friends in Dogville.
That was for sure.

624
00:54:31,003 --> 00:54:34,799
Whether they were few or many did not matter a jot.

625
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:40,346
Grace had bared her throat to the town
and it had responded with a great gift:

626
00:54:40,763 --> 00:54:42,723
with friends.

627
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:54,025
No gangster could deprive her of this
meeting with the township,
no matter how many guns in the world.

628
00:54:54,526 --> 00:55:00,407
And should the strokes of the bell did not reach 15,
she knew now that she meant something to the town

629
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:03,660
and that her stay had been of significance.

630
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:09,040
Not much, perhaps, but nevertheless,
a trace she had left.

631
00:55:09,957 --> 00:55:13,878
And the first in her young life
in which she took pride.

632
00:55:27,975 --> 00:55:31,603
Grace stiffened as the bell began its toll.

633
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:19,316
Fourteen. Grace counted.

634
00:56:19,733 --> 00:56:27,699
So McKay must have voted for her after all,
and if so, why not Chuck, too?

635
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:11,199
Everyone?

636
00:57:12,825 --> 00:57:14,410
- Chuck!
- Chuck!

637
00:57:14,744 --> 00:57:16,287
Everyone.

638
00:57:17,622 --> 00:57:20,291
I think they like you here.

639
00:57:38,976 --> 00:57:43,855
[Narrator] The period of spring and early summer
proved a happy one for Grace.

640
00:57:44,397 --> 00:57:47,651
Martha rang the hours,
conducting her through the day.

641
00:57:47,692 --> 00:57:52,655
So she could serve as eyes for McKay,
a mother for Ben,

642
00:57:53,656 --> 00:57:58,828
friend for Vera,
and brains for Bill...

643
00:58:08,379 --> 00:58:14,927
And one day it had occurred to Grace
to tread the pedals herself so to get Martha to agree

644
00:58:14,927 --> 00:58:18,305
to play a couple of paper notes,
just to empty the bellows naturally

645
00:58:18,347 --> 00:58:22,476
so that they wouldn't be left under pressure
and thus be spoiled.

646
00:58:23,226 --> 00:58:28,773
And now they had tacitly agreed that
as long as it was Grace who trode the pedals,

647
00:58:28,815 --> 00:58:31,985
Martha could play without feeling any guilt.

648
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:41,619
To Tom's pop, the old doctor, who imagined
he had a new ailment every single day

649
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:46,916
and was thus increasingly addicted to
the simpler coordination tests
from his medical school days,

650
00:58:46,916 --> 00:58:51,754
she had to be severe, telling him that
there was nothing wrong with him.

651
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:59,428
And now, since the town had agreed that
everyone was to give according to his abilities

652
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:05,600
she received wages, not much, but enough
to save up for the first of the tiny china figurines

653
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:11,022
from the row of seven that had stood
for so long gathering dust in the window of the store.

654
00:59:12,232 --> 00:59:17,111
And she dreamed that in time she would
be able to acquire them all.

655
00:59:20,073 --> 00:59:28,039
Slowly those alabaster hands turned
into a pair of hands that could have belonged to
anyone in any little rural community.

656
00:59:29,248 --> 00:59:35,796
And three weeks later she triumphantly
moved into a place Tom and Ben had secretly restored,

657
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:40,884
namely the old mill, which had once held
the town's ore crusher,

658
00:59:40,926 --> 00:59:45,180
but of which only the heavy
flywheel now remained.

659
00:59:52,395 --> 00:59:53,188
Thanks.

660
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,274
That's what I am talking about
with the freight industry.

661
00:59:57,066 --> 01:00:00,403
Miss Laura had thrown that out,
it was no use to anybody.

662
01:00:01,696 --> 01:00:06,075
A good thing, in the wrong place.
But with my truck... You know.

663
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,786
You shouldn't poke fun at
the freight industry, that's all.

664
01:00:10,162 --> 01:00:13,165
No, you're right, Ben.
They shouldn't.

665
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:20,672
Grace!

666
01:00:22,758 --> 01:00:23,592
What?

667
01:00:24,384 --> 01:00:29,181
I just had to tell you that I had a really
selfish reason for voting to keep you in Dogville.

668
01:00:33,727 --> 01:00:34,894
What was it?

669
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:42,151
It was such a relief when you turned up
and you were the one all the men had eyes for.

670
01:00:42,694 --> 01:00:48,324
You know, Tom and them.
I've had to put up with it for so long..

671
01:00:49,242 --> 01:00:52,536
Frankly, I just didn't have
the energy for it anymore.

672
01:00:52,912 --> 01:00:55,289
They'll always have eyes for you, Liz.

673
01:00:56,791 --> 01:01:03,213
You know that.. They will.
You are beautiful.

674
01:01:03,297 --> 01:01:04,173
Thank you.

675
01:01:05,841 --> 01:01:10,012
[Narrator] The very latest development,
now that summer was at its peak,

676
01:01:10,137 --> 01:01:13,849
was that Grace had been given leave
to help Chuck in the orchard.

677
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:21,523
And every day at 5, once their work was done,
she could appreciate that actually McKay was right;

678
01:01:21,564 --> 01:01:27,195
the shadow of the spire did indeed
point at Ma Ginger's store.

679
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:36,120
But today the tower did not only announce
that it was time to go shopping but also,

680
01:01:36,162 --> 01:01:42,835
by a signal which nobody despite Martha's
initial concern could have confused with the ringing of the hours,

681
01:01:43,043 --> 01:01:48,298
a warning that somebody was approaching
via Canyon Road from Georgetown.

682
01:01:48,465 --> 01:01:54,262
For the first time in living memory
law enforcers had come to Dogville!

683
01:02:03,354 --> 01:02:04,689
Evenin' sir.

684
01:02:07,108 --> 01:02:09,360
Is this the whole place?

685
01:02:10,528 --> 01:02:13,114
- There's a town hall?
- No.

686
01:02:13,364 --> 01:02:15,241
I got me a notice to paste up.

687
01:02:15,366 --> 01:02:18,327
We got the mission house.
That do you?

688
01:02:18,786 --> 01:02:19,954
Sure.

689
01:02:20,996 --> 01:02:22,206
What'd she do?

690
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:27,920
Missing! That's all it says.
I guess somebody's been missing her.

691
01:02:28,087 --> 01:02:30,672
Heard tell she was last seen around here.

692
01:02:31,506 --> 01:02:33,842
We've putting these things
all over the county.

693
01:02:34,968 --> 01:02:37,012
And if somebody sees her,
they ought to go to the police?

694
01:02:37,762 --> 01:02:39,681
I guess that's the idea.

695
01:03:11,712 --> 01:03:14,256
These men were never gonna give in easily.

696
01:03:15,215 --> 01:03:19,678
Now these posters they hang
all over in the county.

697
01:03:21,304 --> 01:03:24,182
which means nobody suspects
she's right here with us.

698
01:03:24,224 --> 01:03:28,144
But it was a policeman, Tom.
Isn't it a duty to respond to the police?

699
01:03:28,144 --> 01:03:36,486
I mean, legally speaking.
I'm sorry, I just.. when I get upset.

700
01:03:37,111 --> 01:03:40,906
She's just a missing person.
She hasn't done anything. He even said so.

701
01:03:40,948 --> 01:03:42,575
I think you should vote again.

702
01:03:42,575 --> 01:03:48,163
Why? We can't resort to plebiscites
time and time again.

703
01:03:49,415 --> 01:03:56,046
Come on. Who's really got cold feet
because of her picture on a piece of paper?

704
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:28,410
[Narrator] The 4th of July came with the huge
clouds of seeds from some remote meadow
gracefully floating down Elm Street in the early evening.

705
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:34,374
Today was a day for celebration.
Nobody was to worry about the hard times.

706
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,086
And Grace could stop at Ma Ginger's
window quite content:

707
01:04:38,462 --> 01:04:44,134
to ascertain that only two of the little china
figurines remained, and were thus the only two

708
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:47,804
she had not yet been able to
save up enough to purchase.

709
01:04:52,225 --> 01:04:54,102
- It looks great, girls..
- Uh-huh..

710
01:04:56,312 --> 01:05:00,858
Grace, could you put in a couple of hours
with me in the orchard again today?

711
01:05:01,234 --> 01:05:03,986
It's really nice down there with the sunshine!

712
01:05:04,153 --> 01:05:09,742
Chuck, it's the fourth of July!
What are you talking about sunshine for?

713
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:13,912
Have you turned into a romantic like me?

714
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:19,501
We're gonna have fun.

715
01:05:20,752 --> 01:05:22,796
And in the winter we'll all starve...

716
01:05:23,505 --> 01:05:26,383
Even Ben's taking the day off.

717
01:05:28,051 --> 01:05:30,011
- Hi!
- Hi, Tom!

718
01:05:30,262 --> 01:05:32,138
Grace, you've got a moment?

719
01:05:34,474 --> 01:05:35,475
Now?

720
01:05:36,643 --> 01:05:40,188
Yeah. I've got something
interesting to tell you.

721
01:05:42,065 --> 01:05:44,066
Well, it has to be quick.

722
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:54,034
I've got so much going on in my head...

723
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:58,122
That must be very tiring for you!

724
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,626
I think I've done a pretty good analysis
of the folks in this town

725
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:11,968
and I think I understand them
in a meaningful way.

726
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:19,893
But when I come to decipher you,
I get absolutely nowhere.

727
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:24,856
You know Liz...
Liz is easy to read.

728
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,653
And there was some attraction between us,

729
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:36,075
but as I can see right through her,

730
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:40,120
intellectually I mean, I can see right through her,

731
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:48,003
my desire is purely of a physical nature.

732
01:06:50,547 --> 01:06:58,388
But with you, it's more...
it's more complicated.

733
01:06:58,388 --> 01:07:00,306
What are you trying to say?

734
01:07:03,643 --> 01:07:06,270
No, I should get it clear in my head first.

735
01:07:08,773 --> 01:07:11,359
Are you trying to say that ...

736
01:07:13,486 --> 01:07:15,738
you're in love with me?

737
01:07:17,615 --> 01:07:29,126
No, I wouldn't.. love is...
It's not... It's a big word...

738
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:29,876
Yeah.

739
01:07:34,422 --> 01:07:35,674
Yeah.

740
01:07:37,801 --> 01:07:39,135
That's good!

741
01:07:43,097 --> 01:07:44,390
because ...

742
01:07:48,436 --> 01:07:51,772
I think that I am in love with you, too.

743
01:07:53,399 --> 01:07:55,443
Very interesting, isn't it?

744
01:07:57,319 --> 01:08:01,407
I mean it's interesting in a psychological...

745
01:08:07,746 --> 01:08:12,125
Did they call you?
I think they are calling you.

746
01:08:15,253 --> 01:08:17,130
I didn't hear them.

747
01:08:20,592 --> 01:08:21,760
No.

748
01:08:24,929 --> 01:08:29,058
You should probably get back anyway.

749
01:08:31,978 --> 01:08:35,398
I will see you at the wedding.
Next celebration..

750
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:14,393
This year I didn't bring any notes with me.

751
01:09:14,769 --> 01:09:17,855
Because I'm not gonna pretend
I can read them.

752
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:23,569
Which brings me to a point.
A point I wanna make.

753
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:28,407
And that point is you, Grace.

754
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:36,081
Yes. You have made Dogville
a wonderful place to live in.

755
01:09:36,832 --> 01:09:43,338
As a matter of fact, somebody tells me
they ran into grumpy old Chuck down the street

756
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:45,799
and he was actually smiling.

757
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:54,599
Well, I've never seen your smile, Grace,
but I will bet you I could describe it.

758
01:09:56,601 --> 01:10:04,900
Because it obviously has every color
that's reflected from the shiniest prism in the world.

759
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:09,738
You probably have a face to match that.
Does she have a face to match that, Tom?

760
01:10:09,822 --> 01:10:11,990
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm..?
- Yes, sir.

761
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:16,662
I bet she does.
We are proud to have you among us.

762
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:24,127
And we thank you for
showing us who you are.

763
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:26,671
Here to you, Grace.

764
01:10:27,505 --> 01:10:30,133
Stay with us as long as you damn please.

765
01:10:53,864 --> 01:10:58,285
A police car has just been seen in town and
it has just made the turn up Canyon Road!

766
01:10:58,952 --> 01:11:00,120
So he will be here any minute.

767
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:01,872
Shall I ring the bell?

768
01:11:02,831 --> 01:11:05,750
No, Martha.
Grace probably heard.

769
01:11:07,085 --> 01:11:08,628
We'll get rid of 'em quickly.

770
01:11:09,838 --> 01:11:10,922
Don't worry.

771
01:11:24,602 --> 01:11:27,938
Should have been celebrating myself,
if this hadn't come up.

772
01:11:28,689 --> 01:11:31,317
Have to change this missing person notice.

773
01:11:32,651 --> 01:11:34,445
It's that lady again.

774
01:11:35,988 --> 01:11:37,739
That's why she disappeared.

775
01:11:39,825 --> 01:11:43,870
She's wanted in connection with some
bank robberies on the West Coast.

776
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:46,957
When did these robberies take place?

777
01:11:47,415 --> 01:11:49,000
Last couple of weeks.

778
01:11:50,377 --> 01:11:52,629
You don't get much news up here,
do you?

779
01:11:52,754 --> 01:11:55,298
My dad's radio only plays music.

780
01:11:57,508 --> 01:12:00,386
Well, all know is that they say she's dangerous,

781
01:12:00,595 --> 01:12:05,016
and that anyone with any information
about her had better call us pronto.

782
01:12:05,433 --> 01:12:06,892
That's the law.

783
01:12:22,407 --> 01:12:27,329
Two weeks!
Can't be our girl, Tom.

784
01:12:27,788 --> 01:12:29,789
No, she's been here all the time.

785
01:12:29,789 --> 01:12:30,665
Right!

786
01:12:30,749 --> 01:12:33,126
She couldn't have done
what they are accusing her of.

787
01:12:34,335 --> 01:12:36,087
No, that's true, Tom,
you are right.

788
01:12:36,337 --> 01:12:39,340
Still it's an unpleasant business
just the same.

789
01:12:46,806 --> 01:12:50,017
[Narrator] Grace was the same
and so was the town.

790
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:58,400
That the gangsters had fixed to have
charges made against Grace in their effort
to neuralize her came as no surprise.

791
01:12:59,651 --> 01:13:02,988
But everything had changed a little
yet again.

792
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:09,870
I'm telling you, you have exactly the same
kind of little lump in exactly the same spot
on the other side of your back.

793
01:13:09,911 --> 01:13:10,704
Really!

794
01:13:10,704 --> 01:13:21,297
I can only assume that it belongs
on your body, but you're the doctor, so...

795
01:13:21,673 --> 01:13:28,012
Well, it's very unlikely, don't you think?
that a cancer would develop in such precise symmetry.

796
01:13:28,012 --> 01:13:33,851
- Mr. Edison, please. We've been
over this so many times.
- Anything is possible.

797
01:13:33,893 --> 01:13:41,483
I think you have to accept the fact
that you are an exceptionally healthy elderly gentleman.

798
01:13:42,025 --> 01:13:44,444
I'm gonna rest just the same.

799
01:13:44,528 --> 01:13:45,988
I'll see you in the morning.

800
01:13:46,446 --> 01:13:47,781
I hope so.

801
01:13:48,365 --> 01:13:50,700
What? What did they say?

802
01:13:50,909 --> 01:13:57,999
Well, they couldn't really argue
that anything had changed.

803
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:03,213
But by not telling the police they felt
they were committing a crime themselves.

804
01:14:06,924 --> 01:14:08,801
- I think I should leave.
- No..

805
01:14:08,885 --> 01:14:10,219
Enough is enough.

806
01:14:10,261 --> 01:14:12,096
I suggested the opposite.

807
01:14:13,139 --> 01:14:14,265
You did?

808
01:14:14,765 --> 01:14:18,269
From a business perspective, ...

809
01:14:19,687 --> 01:14:26,109
from a business perspective,
your presence in Dogville has become more costly.

810
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:30,280
Because it's more dangerous
for them to have you here,

811
01:14:30,447 --> 01:14:32,657
not that they don't want you,

812
01:14:33,366 --> 01:14:38,872
since they feel there should be
some counterbalance,

813
01:14:39,748 --> 01:14:41,791
some quid pro quo.

814
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:44,711
That sound like words
that the gangsters would use...

815
01:14:44,919 --> 01:14:49,757
There is also more of an incentive
if you don't wanna stay.

816
01:14:51,801 --> 01:14:58,724
See, with all those wanted posters
hanging around the place, I can hardly
think of anywhere else you could hide.

817
01:15:00,809 --> 01:15:03,812
So what's the counterbalance
that you suggested?

818
01:15:07,566 --> 01:15:13,864
They wanted you to work longer hours,
but instead what I proposed is

819
01:15:13,864 --> 01:15:19,619
that you just pay a visit to folks
twice a day now.

820
01:15:19,744 --> 01:15:26,251
That way it would seem that you're willing
to contribute more, without actually
lengthening your day too much.

821
01:15:26,376 --> 01:15:29,337
It's just a way of heading off
any unpleasantness.

822
01:15:34,759 --> 01:15:41,765
Well, it sounds a little peculiar
and difficult to put into practice.

823
01:15:41,765 --> 01:15:43,767
That's what I thought.

824
01:15:44,184 --> 01:15:47,688
Martha she said she would ring
her bell every half hour,

825
01:15:47,771 --> 01:15:50,899
so you could keep track of
your new schedule.

826
01:15:53,777 --> 01:15:55,570
Then, they are all willing to let me stay?

827
01:15:55,612 --> 01:16:03,411
No. See, Mrs. Henson she also
thought we should cut your pay.

828
01:16:03,912 --> 01:16:12,587
Merely a symbolic gesture. You see...
the word dangerous on that poster worried her.

829
01:16:14,589 --> 01:16:21,387
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
If I have to work harder, longer hours for less pay,

830
01:16:21,429 --> 01:16:24,557
then I'm willing to do that.
Of course, I am.

831
01:16:26,308 --> 01:16:31,480
I just wanna be sure that they
wouldn't prefer that I left town.

832
01:16:31,522 --> 01:16:33,023
Of course not.

833
01:16:35,609 --> 01:16:37,903
You think this is for the best?

834
01:16:38,779 --> 01:16:40,655
I know it is.

835
01:16:44,117 --> 01:16:52,375
I have to get some sleep. My days are
gonna be much busier now.

836
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:53,751
Sorry.

837
01:17:18,317 --> 01:17:24,865
Tom, I just need to know something...

838
01:17:27,492 --> 01:17:31,121
you know the card that the man
in the car gave you...

839
01:17:31,329 --> 01:17:32,247
Yeah.

840
01:17:38,169 --> 01:17:40,421
Did you show it to anyone?

841
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:45,843
Come on, Grace!
I burned it first thing.

842
01:17:46,343 --> 01:17:49,930
I've been so silly.
Of course you did.

843
01:17:49,972 --> 01:17:51,432
It's alright.

844
01:17:52,182 --> 01:17:56,895
No, it's not alright. I hate it
for you to see me like this.

845
01:17:56,937 --> 01:17:59,231
I can't bare that I'm doubting you.

846
01:17:59,648 --> 01:18:02,401
I'm sorry.
Good night.

847
01:18:22,628 --> 01:18:27,425
[Narrator] Everybody was really against
any changes to Grace's working conditions at all

848
01:18:27,508 --> 01:18:30,427
when the subjuct occasionally
came up in conversation.

849
01:18:38,393 --> 01:18:42,731
Oh, Ben had declared in sympathy that
he wouldn't accept any more work than before,

850
01:18:42,856 --> 01:18:44,858
and Grace was grateful for that,

851
01:18:46,151 --> 01:18:48,862
even if he was a bit drunk
when he said so.

852
01:18:52,365 --> 01:18:58,830
Busy minute became busy hours,
and busy hours became busy days.

853
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:06,212
and irrespective of whether they thought
the idea of increasing Grace's services had
any fairness and justification to it or not,

854
01:19:06,295 --> 01:19:09,382
it didn't seem to make anyone any happier.

855
01:19:09,507 --> 01:19:11,801
More to the contrary.

856
01:19:13,677 --> 01:19:17,306
Grace, oh.. You have to be more careful.

857
01:19:17,681 --> 01:19:21,518
Liz wasn't very careful either,
but she didn't break our glasses.

858
01:19:21,894 --> 01:19:27,941
I think you need to understand that Mr. Henson
works very hard to grind off any traces of moulds.

859
01:19:28,483 --> 01:19:32,487
and it makes the glass weak.
I thought you knew that.

860
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:36,574
It won't happen again.
Of course, I'll pay for it.

861
01:19:37,325 --> 01:19:41,162
No, of course not. You don't have to
pay us for it. We'll get over it.

862
01:19:43,206 --> 01:19:49,253
[Narrator] And off she went to keep
her appointment with Chuck to free
the last tree trunks from the grass

863
01:19:49,253 --> 01:19:52,465
in order to keep the ever busy mice away.

864
01:19:53,257 --> 01:19:57,136
She was in a hurry and took the shortcut
between the gooseberry bushes,

865
01:19:57,177 --> 01:19:59,471
only to be brought up by a shout.

866
01:19:59,596 --> 01:20:01,515
- Grace!
- Yes!

867
01:20:04,268 --> 01:20:10,357
Oh, I didn't see that you just
raked the path. I'm sorry.

868
01:20:10,398 --> 01:20:12,526
It isn't that I've just raked it.

869
01:20:12,734 --> 01:20:17,447
The idea is that people can pass
around the bushes completely.

870
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:19,657
I prefer it that way,
as you should know.

871
01:20:20,909 --> 01:20:26,414
I thought that these chains were put up
to make a path between the bushes.

872
01:20:26,414 --> 01:20:28,708
They were put up there to protect the bushes.

873
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:30,585
It is not supposed to be a pathway.

874
01:20:30,668 --> 01:20:32,503
But everyone goes this way.

875
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:36,799
Dear, that's right.
They have been living here for years.

876
01:20:36,841 --> 01:20:38,509
You haven't been here that long.

877
01:20:40,094 --> 01:20:46,517
Are you saying, that I am less entitled
to use the shortcut
because I haven't always lived here?

878
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,392
No, of course not.

879
01:20:48,226 --> 01:20:51,980
"No, I just thought it pleased you
to be here, that's all."

880
01:20:52,606 --> 01:20:54,858
"Go on.
Go on, it's alright."

881
01:20:55,275 --> 01:20:57,027
I'll see you this afternoon..

882
01:20:57,110 --> 01:21:02,157
"and I'll rake those bushes like they've
never been raked before, I promise."

883
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:14,043
I'm sorry about that branch.
There were so many apples on it.

884
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:19,423
"I should have cut that brance,
but I got greedy."

885
01:21:20,674 --> 01:21:23,636
Is it greedy to want to feed your family?

886
01:21:29,349 --> 01:21:31,310
So how come you don't like me?

887
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:37,440
Why do you ask me that?

888
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:40,151
"When I get close to you,
you edge away."

889
01:21:42,153 --> 01:21:45,073
"- No, I don't.
- You did so."

890
01:21:46,074 --> 01:21:48,743
When we were thinning the seedlings
in the bottom row.

891
01:21:49,911 --> 01:21:53,289
How am I supposed to show you what I do
if I ain't allow to touch you?

892
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:57,293
You tried to kiss me.

893
01:22:05,759 --> 01:22:11,098
Vera never took any interest in the apples.
She hates the orchard.

894
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:18,146
"The is the first time I've ever met anyone,
who understand about the apples."

895
01:22:19,272 --> 01:22:21,441
Sorry... it made me so happy.

896
01:22:25,695 --> 01:22:26,863
It's alright.

897
01:22:26,905 --> 01:22:31,909
"No, it ain't alright. I reckon the stuff
about the apples is just words in your mouth."

898
01:22:33,077 --> 01:22:35,371
If you can't really share my pleasure...

899
01:22:35,955 --> 01:22:37,206
I do.

900
01:22:38,457 --> 01:22:42,545
Vera wants me to picking apples
from trees that are barely in the ground.

901
01:22:43,462 --> 01:22:45,881
Things take time. That's love!

902
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:51,136
Seeing what they need and
respecting those needs.

903
01:22:51,261 --> 01:22:53,680
"If anyone understands that, it's you.
At least I thought so."

904
01:22:53,722 --> 01:22:55,098
I do understand that.

905
01:22:55,098 --> 01:22:57,351
But you edge away when I get close.

906
01:22:57,851 --> 01:23:01,688
- Why do you find me so repugnant?
- I don't find you repugnant.

907
01:23:03,815 --> 01:23:05,442
Don't be upset.

908
01:23:07,068 --> 01:23:11,239
I'm sorry if I doubted you.
It won't happen again.

909
01:23:13,282 --> 01:23:14,951
I promise you.

910
01:23:17,537 --> 01:23:20,331
I wouldn't make that promise if I were you.

911
01:23:26,504 --> 01:23:29,423
"When you fended me off,
a thought came into my mind"

912
01:23:29,632 --> 01:23:34,261
that made me ashamed.
A thought that you would hate me for.

913
01:23:35,179 --> 01:23:38,890
"I would never hate you, never."

914
01:23:43,937 --> 01:23:44,771
What?

915
01:23:47,273 --> 01:23:53,363
"Chuck, I've treated you unfairly.
It's alright to have angry
thoughts."

916
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:58,242
I thought of turning you in!

917
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:02,788
I thought of blackmailing you
into respecting me.

918
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:17,803
"It means that much to you?
It does, doesn't it?"

919
01:24:20,263 --> 01:24:23,225
"You've really been alone up here,
haven't you?"

920
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:30,565
You haven't had anyone to comfort you
and I should ask you for forgiveness.

921
01:24:38,072 --> 01:24:39,615
Still friends?

922
01:25:09,144 --> 01:25:12,272
- Sorry... Were you asleep?
- No.

923
01:25:13,273 --> 01:25:17,360
"- Do you want me to leave?
- No, I was just resting."

924
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:25,034
"Awful lot to do here in Dogville,
considering nobody needs anything done."

925
01:25:27,036 --> 01:25:30,414
Jason wants to sit on my lap all the time.

926
01:25:34,251 --> 01:25:37,212
I think you're doing a wonderful job.

927
01:25:38,964 --> 01:25:43,343
You give us all so much.
What Mr. McKay said...

928
01:25:43,385 --> 01:25:46,930
right on the button..
right on the button.

929
01:25:47,472 --> 01:25:50,475
He tried to put his hands on my knee today.

930
01:25:50,517 --> 01:25:54,354
"Oh, he is blind, after all.
Probably an accident."

931
01:25:57,732 --> 01:26:04,864
And Ma Ginger got angry at me
for running across the gravel path.

932
01:26:07,158 --> 01:26:10,703
"Well good. She gets angry at me,"

933
01:26:12,788 --> 01:26:15,291
which just means that you're one of us now.

934
01:26:15,374 --> 01:26:18,168
"You can see through it all, can't you?"

935
01:26:34,184 --> 01:26:37,395
"I'll tell you, I'm gonna be asleep
in two minutes."

936
01:26:37,729 --> 01:26:40,273
What if I don't want you to go to sleep?

937
01:26:40,607 --> 01:26:42,900
I don't think you have a choice tonight.

938
01:26:54,161 --> 01:26:56,330
"I do love you, Grace."

939
01:26:57,706 --> 01:27:03,921
"I'm glad you love me.
I love you, too. I really do."

940
01:27:08,258 --> 01:27:14,181
"No, I mean, I yearn for you
when I am not with you."

941
01:27:18,476 --> 01:27:22,438
I yearn for you even
when we're alone like this.

942
01:27:24,691 --> 01:27:31,614
"I yearn to be even closer to you...
to touch you, the way that people..."

943
01:27:31,656 --> 01:27:34,533
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

944
01:27:37,536 --> 01:27:41,749
The thing that I love about you is
that you don't demand anything of me.

945
01:27:41,874 --> 01:27:46,086
That we can just be together.

946
01:27:46,295 --> 01:27:47,462
Yeah.

947
01:27:49,548 --> 01:27:52,968
Yearning will only make it better.

948
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:06,022
"Thank you for your words,
your wise wise words."

949
01:28:08,066 --> 01:28:09,817
You're welcome.

950
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:14,572
Do you want your shoes off?

951
01:28:41,056 --> 01:28:45,477
"Jason, what are you doing here?
That's wrong."

952
01:28:46,811 --> 01:28:49,606
The words have to be divided differently.

953
01:28:51,941 --> 01:28:53,109
Stop it.

954
01:28:53,484 --> 01:28:56,112
How's that for dividing the words?

955
01:28:58,406 --> 01:29:00,866
This is not a good day.
Everybody should leave.

956
01:29:00,908 --> 01:29:04,328
"Everybody except Jason.
Jason, I wanna talk to you alone."

957
01:29:04,662 --> 01:29:07,915
What is it?
What's going on?

958
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:13,712
I can be very bad.
I bet my pa told you.

959
01:29:13,712 --> 01:29:17,674
I don't think that.
I think there is another reason for this.

960
01:29:19,134 --> 01:29:24,180
"I'd love to have you on my lap all the time,
but I can't, not with the others here."

961
01:29:25,974 --> 01:29:29,686
"When somebody can't do all the things
they'd like to do for others,"

962
01:29:30,228 --> 01:29:33,523
sometimes the people they promised get mad.

963
01:29:34,816 --> 01:29:37,235
That's what Mrs. Henson says.

964
01:29:39,237 --> 01:29:40,321
"Yes, that's true."

965
01:29:40,363 --> 01:29:43,574
I suppose I know why you won't let
me sit in your lap anymore.

966
01:29:44,909 --> 01:29:47,161
- Why?
- Because I've been mean lately.

967
01:29:47,202 --> 01:29:51,457
"Oh, come on. I'm sure you have
your reasons for that."

968
01:29:51,957 --> 01:29:56,712
"I have been mean to the others, too,
even baby Achilles."

969
01:29:57,004 --> 01:30:00,090
And he's so tiny he can't put up a fight.

970
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:04,511
"- It's not right
- No, it's not."

971
01:30:04,636 --> 01:30:08,014
"I got it coming to me, I know."

972
01:30:08,723 --> 01:30:10,266
I deserve a spanking.

973
01:30:10,308 --> 01:30:13,686
What? I should hit you?
I'm not gonna do that.

974
01:30:14,646 --> 01:30:18,065
Your mother doesn't believe in
physical discipline. I'm not gonna hit you.

975
01:30:18,107 --> 01:30:22,653
I know. She'd be awful mad
if she found out you whipped me.

976
01:30:23,487 --> 01:30:25,740
"Oh, I just said I won't do that."

977
01:30:25,906 --> 01:30:32,788
"It's good having ma on your side, right?
It'd be pretty serious if she turned against you."

978
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:35,791
"I am the way I am.
If people in this town don't like me,"

979
01:30:35,833 --> 01:30:38,794
then there is nothing I can do about that.

980
01:30:39,628 --> 01:30:42,214
I feel bad I need to be punished.

981
01:30:42,339 --> 01:30:45,717
"The fact is, I wouldn't have any respect
for you if you don't give me a spanking."

982
01:30:45,759 --> 01:30:48,720
I don't care how much fun you think it would be.

983
01:30:48,762 --> 01:30:51,514
"I'm not gonna spank you, Jason."

984
01:30:52,515 --> 01:30:59,063
"In that case, when Ma gets home
maybe I'll just have to tell her you hit me."

985
01:30:59,188 --> 01:31:00,690
But I just said that I wouldn't!

986
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:03,317
I reckon Ma'll take my word for it.

987
01:31:04,652 --> 01:31:08,114
"If you give me that spanking,
nobody's ever have to know."

988
01:31:13,911 --> 01:31:16,872
Stop it. Get away from Achilles.
Stop it.

989
01:31:17,748 --> 01:31:22,002
I gave his crib a shove.
It's not my fault it didn't tip over.

990
01:31:22,044 --> 01:31:24,880
Don't you touch him.
Move away from the crib.

991
01:31:24,963 --> 01:31:27,340
"Stop it, Jason. Stop it!"

992
01:31:27,465 --> 01:31:29,384
All right. You want a spanking.
I'll give you a spanking...

993
01:31:29,426 --> 01:31:31,553
Come here.
Come here!

994
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:37,350
- There! There we go.
- That wasn't hard.

995
01:31:37,684 --> 01:31:40,520
It's gotta be hard or it isn't punishment.

996
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:43,272
- All right.
- Harder!

997
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:48,277
"Oh, this is... come on.
All right, that's enough."

998
01:31:48,444 --> 01:31:49,695
That is enough punishment now.

999
01:31:49,779 --> 01:31:53,365
Maybe I should go stand in the corner
and be ashamed?

1000
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:56,869
I don't care.. Stand in the corner.
Do whatever you gotta do.

1001
01:31:56,994 --> 01:31:58,579
"Hey, there is Pa!"

1002
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:05,002
He's early. I hope there is nothing wrong.

1003
01:32:05,043 --> 01:32:12,592
"[Narrator] Just as Dogville had done from
its open, frail shelf on the mountainside,
quite unprotected from any capricious storms,"

1004
01:32:12,717 --> 01:32:15,595
"Grace, too, had laid herself open."

1005
01:32:16,513 --> 01:32:21,893
And there she dangled from her frail stalk
like the apple in the Garden of Eden.

1006
01:32:22,268 --> 01:32:26,105
An apple so swollen that the juices almost ran.

1007
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:32,027
And once again the police
had come to Dogville.

1008
01:32:33,946 --> 01:32:39,576
"I said I'd tell you, to save Martha
the confusion about the ringing. But I forgot."

1009
01:32:39,618 --> 01:32:41,537
They're already down by Canyon Road.

1010
01:32:41,537 --> 01:32:44,831
The fellow in the other car is from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1011
01:32:44,873 --> 01:32:46,875
- You forgot!
- Yah.

1012
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:49,669
"It is the busy time for the apples,
you know."

1013
01:32:49,669 --> 01:32:50,670
The FBI?

1014
01:32:51,546 --> 01:32:55,342
"They were most interested in hearing
what I'd seen in the past six months,"

1015
01:32:55,592 --> 01:32:58,178
anything related to that wanted poster.

1016
01:32:58,553 --> 01:33:04,142
They asked me if I'd seen any signs
in the woods of anyone camping out there.

1017
01:33:04,267 --> 01:33:07,061
God only knows
what that woman's capable of.

1018
01:33:07,145 --> 01:33:09,230
"You know, she is not capable of anything."

1019
01:33:09,230 --> 01:33:15,236
"Well, that's what you say.
But it sure didn't sound that way coming from the laws."

1020
01:33:16,946 --> 01:33:19,448
That's why I felt I had to tell 'em
what I knew.

1021
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:23,827
What did you tell them?

1022
01:33:24,369 --> 01:33:27,289
"Well, I thought I'd seen something
in the woods recently."

1023
01:33:27,748 --> 01:33:30,208
An item of clothing to be exact.

1024
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:33,461
It turned out that it was just
an old hat Tom had lost.

1025
01:33:33,795 --> 01:33:36,673
- But it could've been this.
-  Chuck.. give me..

1026
01:33:36,673 --> 01:33:41,302
"Expensive, by the feel of it,
and your initials on it."

1027
01:33:44,514 --> 01:33:48,184
I imagine they'd draw the same conclusion
from this as anybody would.

1028
01:33:48,184 --> 01:33:52,939
I told the law it'd take me no time at all
to find this piece of clothing.

1029
01:33:53,814 --> 01:33:59,153
"I reckon we got us ten minutes, maybe fifteen,
'fore they start knocking on doors."

1030
01:33:59,403 --> 01:34:03,991
I wouldn't try to run away.
They are sure to see you.

1031
01:34:04,283 --> 01:34:06,118
"Why would I wanna run away, Chuck?"

1032
01:34:06,243 --> 01:34:08,078
"I wouldn't try to holler, either."

1033
01:34:08,078 --> 01:34:09,997
Why would I wanna do that?

1034
01:34:10,122 --> 01:34:12,165
It wasn't me who wanted you here.

1035
01:34:12,249 --> 01:34:14,876
You were far to beautiful and frail
for this place.

1036
01:34:16,419 --> 01:34:19,005
You tricked me into feeling that
I meant something to you.

1037
01:34:19,089 --> 01:34:21,591
"It's your own damn fault.
I need your respect, Grace."

1038
01:34:22,133 --> 01:34:25,345
- You have my respect.
- I want your respect.

1039
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:26,137
Don't...!

1040
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:42,319
This is wrong..

1041
01:34:43,988 --> 01:34:49,701
"If I can force the flowers to bloom
early in spring, I can force you..."

1042
01:34:50,827 --> 01:34:52,371
Please...

1043
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:07,427
"Stop it!
Please.. Please... Please, don't!"

1044
01:35:07,635 --> 01:35:10,304
Please! Please...

1045
01:35:10,888 --> 01:35:14,016
"Please look at me, talk to me."

1046
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:17,979
"We're friends, you and my family.."

1047
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:23,234
Stop it!

1048
01:36:22,415 --> 01:36:24,125
Have you seen Grace?

1049
01:36:24,793 --> 01:36:26,378
She's at my place.

1050
01:36:26,836 --> 01:36:30,298
- Is she busy?
- Not anymore. Go right in.

1051
01:36:55,405 --> 01:37:01,995
[Narrator] Yet again Grace had made
a miraculous escape from her pursuers
with the aid of the people of Dogville.

1052
01:37:02,579 --> 01:37:07,125
"Everyone had covered up for her,
including Chuck, who had to admit"

1053
01:37:07,167 --> 01:37:12,547
that it was probably Tom's hat he'd
mistakenly considered so suspicious.

1054
01:37:27,603 --> 01:37:32,524
"That evening Tom had sensed at once
that something had taken place,"

1055
01:37:32,524 --> 01:37:37,029
but had to plead with Grace for ages
before she finally broke down

1056
01:37:37,237 --> 01:37:39,948
and unburdened herself.

1057
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:42,159
- I have to confront him. I mean.
- No!

1058
01:37:42,284 --> 01:37:43,994
- I have no other choice.
- No.

1059
01:37:44,077 --> 01:37:47,080
- No one will accept what he did to you. No one.
- I don't want you to.

1060
01:37:47,205 --> 01:37:53,419
I came here with all these ideas
and these stupid prejudices.

1061
01:37:56,297 --> 01:37:59,842
"He is not strong, Tom."

1062
01:37:59,842 --> 01:38:02,345
"He looks strong, but he's not."

1063
01:38:04,222 --> 01:38:07,683
I'm gonna start looking for a way
to get you out of here.

1064
01:38:20,445 --> 01:38:22,614
[Narrator] The end of the summer had come.

1065
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:30,080
And in Elm Street the second clutch of
Dogville's scatty squirrels scooted in and out
of the legs of children and grown-ups alike

1066
01:38:30,205 --> 01:38:34,167
searching in vain for Elm Street's non-existent elms.

1067
01:38:35,752 --> 01:38:42,091
"The heat had turned the soil among the gooseberry
bushes to stone, but Grace did not complain."

1068
01:38:42,133 --> 01:38:44,343
"She threw herself into her work,"

1069
01:38:44,385 --> 01:38:48,931
happy that it was something you could
actually grasp between your fingers.

1070
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:51,308
"Hey, Liz!
Hey, Vera!"

1071
01:38:51,392 --> 01:38:54,728
"Better watch out, Grace.
Vera's got it in for you today."

1072
01:38:55,688 --> 01:38:57,564
What are you talking about?

1073
01:38:59,066 --> 01:39:01,568
Maybe you thought he wouldn't tell me?

1074
01:39:04,529 --> 01:39:05,656
Who?

1075
01:39:07,157 --> 01:39:09,451
You hit Jason.

1076
01:39:11,578 --> 01:39:12,829
I did.

1077
01:39:13,204 --> 01:39:15,623
How could you do such a thing?

1078
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:20,753
"I know it sounds implausible,
but he was asking for it."

1079
01:39:21,296 --> 01:39:24,590
"It's true, Vera. He's always asking for it."

1080
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:29,428
I should have done that myself
a long time ago.

1081
01:39:29,971 --> 01:39:32,306
"- Liz!
- It's your fault, the way you've spoiled him."

1082
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:38,479
"I know how much you love him,
Vera. So do I..."

1083
01:39:38,812 --> 01:39:42,775
It won't happen again.
It really won't.

1084
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:47,654
"No. I know it won't, because I'll
never leave them with you again."

1085
01:39:48,405 --> 01:39:51,116
That'd be far too dangerous
for any child of mine.

1086
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:52,659
I've been tired.

1087
01:39:52,701 --> 01:39:58,164
"Well, maybe you should see about
sleeping at night, like most folks do."

1088
01:39:58,289 --> 01:39:59,666
Sleeping at night?

1089
01:40:01,417 --> 01:40:10,468
Martha saw a certain Tom Edison Jr.
sneak out of her shed early this morning.

1090
01:40:15,389 --> 01:40:18,767
"Grace, you won't hear anything from me
about whipping that idiot kid."

1091
01:40:19,101 --> 01:40:23,313
And I'm also grateful to you for turning
Tom's wandering eye away from my skirts.

1092
01:40:24,022 --> 01:40:26,817
"But on the other hand, I'd expected
more from you than that."

1093
01:40:29,236 --> 01:40:32,614
"But if that's the kind of thing you're after,
then I'm sure, with your innocent look,"

1094
01:40:32,656 --> 01:40:35,450
you will do just fine
in a place like Dogville.

1095
01:40:35,534 --> 01:40:37,953
"- It's not what I'm after, Liz.
- Oh, no?"

1096
01:40:38,078 --> 01:40:42,790
We all saw you take his hand to the picnic.
Maybe that wasn't flirting?

1097
01:40:44,918 --> 01:40:48,629
Yes... Maybe I was flirting..

1098
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:03,978
[Narrator] Next day the weather changed.
The fog came rolling down from the mountains.

1099
01:41:04,186 --> 01:41:10,525
"And althought there were no sunsets to be seen,
McKay thought it best that she sat by him anyway."

1100
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:14,362
"She had sat by Jack McKay so many times now,"

1101
01:41:14,488 --> 01:41:18,658
but Jack had not got better
at judging the distance between them.

1102
01:41:18,867 --> 01:41:23,746
"On the contrary, where fingers alone
had previously brushed her young flesh,"

1103
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:29,127
now it was a and that remained in place
throughout the allotted span.

1104
01:41:31,629 --> 01:41:36,259
"The hour in the orchard were long now,
for the harvest was under way."

1105
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:42,389
"And Grace had long since given up arguing
with Chuck's perception that respect for cultivation,"

1106
01:41:42,431 --> 01:41:47,770
"harvest, and fruit could be directly
measured in provision of carnality."

1107
01:41:49,062 --> 01:41:54,151
"Though reluctant to leave Grace alone,
Tom wantered around quite often now,"

1108
01:41:54,234 --> 01:41:58,738
lost in thought as he tried to crack
the problem of possible escape.

1109
01:41:59,573 --> 01:42:05,245
"And as Grace's wages no longer found
their way to her purse he had stepped in,"

1110
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:12,251
and together they had triumphantly picked up
the last of the seven figurines
from Ma Ginger's windows.

1111
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:23,679
What's the matter?

1112
01:42:24,763 --> 01:42:28,475
- Nothing.
- Are the police on Canyon Road again?

1113
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:36,692
No. This is just girl talk.

1114
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:41,363
"It's funny you should mention Canyon Road,
though... right, Martha?"

1115
01:42:41,446 --> 01:42:44,282
- She was just there this morning.
- Yeah.

1116
01:42:44,324 --> 01:42:48,244
"- On the way home from church...
- You see so much more on foot, you know."

1117
01:42:48,328 --> 01:42:53,541
"When you're in a car you never notice
the apple orchard, for example."

1118
01:42:56,335 --> 01:43:00,756
You can only see it from one spot
on Canyon Road.

1119
01:43:01,173 --> 01:43:04,802
"- Do you know that spot, Martha?
- Yes I do."

1120
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:11,058
And did you stop there to enjoy
the view this morning?

1121
01:43:11,183 --> 01:43:14,770
"It's harvest time, you know,
in the orchard after all."

1122
01:43:14,895 --> 01:43:18,357
The old masters always loved
a good harvest theme.

1123
01:43:18,398 --> 01:43:27,324
"Redolent, with fertility, not to mention
sensibility or even eroticism."

1124
01:43:30,535 --> 01:43:35,957
"But how silly of me to ask you that, Martha,
because you already said you did."

1125
01:43:39,335 --> 01:43:41,629
"She saw you, Grace.."

1126
01:43:46,092 --> 01:43:49,136
She saw you..

1127
01:43:51,388 --> 01:43:54,683
behind this pile of broken limbs..

1128
01:43:56,268 --> 01:43:57,811
with Chuck...

1129
01:44:01,481 --> 01:44:05,777
He said it wasn't the first time
you'd made advances towards him.

1130
01:44:07,404 --> 01:44:11,866
He never told me before because
he wanted to spare my feelings.

1131
01:44:13,493 --> 01:44:18,706
"He's a withdrawn and primitive man,"

1132
01:44:21,459 --> 01:44:26,589
but at heart he's loyal
and he is good.

1133
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:29,967
What do you want with my husband?

1134
01:44:31,385 --> 01:44:40,644
I don't want anything with
your husband or anybody.

1135
01:44:40,686 --> 01:44:43,355
What about Tom and the hand-holding
at the picnic?

1136
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:46,358
That's different. I like Tom.

1137
01:44:48,193 --> 01:44:50,362
But you don't like Chuck.

1138
01:44:50,445 --> 01:44:56,117
"Liz and Martha are behind me, when I tell you
that I'm going to have to teach you a lesson."

1139
01:44:56,117 --> 01:44:58,828
I believe in education.

1140
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:03,458
Vera!

1141
01:45:03,791 --> 01:45:08,838
No. I believe smashing them is
less a crime than making them.

1142
01:45:10,714 --> 01:45:14,718
Vera.. remember how I taught your children..

1143
01:45:14,843 --> 01:45:18,722
"- What?
- Remember how happy you were, when I..."

1144
01:45:18,889 --> 01:45:22,643
- When you what?
- When I taught your children
about the doctrine of stoicism

1145
01:45:22,726 --> 01:45:24,936
and they finally understood it.

1146
01:45:26,855 --> 01:45:29,191
"All right.. For that, I'm gonna be lenient."

1147
01:45:29,191 --> 01:45:32,861
"I'm going to break two of your figurines first,"

1148
01:45:35,572 --> 01:45:45,164
"and if you can demonstrate your knowledge
of the doctrine of stoicism by holding back your tears,"

1149
01:45:45,498 --> 01:45:50,336
I'll stop.
Have you got that?

1150
01:46:03,682 --> 01:46:08,979
"[Narrator] In her lifetime Grace had
considerable practice at constraining her emotions,"

1151
01:46:08,979 --> 01:46:12,941
and would never have believed
it would be hard to control them now.

1152
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:21,449
But as the porcelain pulverized on the floor
it was as if it were human tissue disintegrating.

1153
01:46:23,117 --> 01:46:27,872
The figurines were the offspring of
the meeting between the
township and her.

1154
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:34,795
"They were the proof that in spite of everything,
her suffering had created something of value."

1155
01:46:35,546 --> 01:46:38,215
Grace could not longer cope.

1156
01:46:39,425 --> 01:46:44,972
"For the first time since her childhood,
she wept."

1157
01:47:14,417 --> 01:47:21,715
"Grace went to see Tom that very night,
and informed him that she was ready
to follow his advice and leave the township."

1158
01:47:22,716 --> 01:47:29,014
"And since Tom had just made up his mind
that a third party would be needed
to ensure the success of an escape,"

1159
01:47:29,223 --> 01:47:33,060
they agreed that Ben possessed
the greatest potential.

1160
01:47:34,394 --> 01:47:38,315
"But it was a case where money
was required, Tom concluded,"

1161
01:47:38,523 --> 01:47:45,405
"and estimated, that considering the times and all,
ten dollars would suffice for Ben and his truck."

1162
01:47:45,488 --> 01:47:48,616
- But we don't have ten dollars.
- No. We borrow it.

1163
01:47:50,535 --> 01:47:53,079
- From whom?
- From Dad.

1164
01:47:53,955 --> 01:47:56,332
He has more than that in the medicine closet.

1165
01:47:56,415 --> 01:47:59,001
I talk to him in the morning and arrange a loan.

1166
01:47:59,752 --> 01:48:01,420
But you have a word with Ben...

1167
01:48:01,545 --> 01:48:04,298
"It's the end of the week,
he's bound to be flat broke."

1168
01:48:05,758 --> 01:48:08,343
Tell your father that I will pay him back.

1169
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,179
Of course.

1170
01:48:14,891 --> 01:48:16,017
Thank you.

1171
01:48:19,604 --> 01:48:23,066
You are always rescuing me.

1172
01:48:26,861 --> 01:48:29,989
I can't believe that you go on
being there for me.

1173
01:48:32,784 --> 01:48:33,826
Good night..

1174
01:48:36,996 --> 01:48:38,539
You should get some sleep.

1175
01:48:47,756 --> 01:48:50,592
[Narrator] Grace went to see Ben next morning.

1176
01:48:54,888 --> 01:48:58,767
"When Grace presented the payment
as compensation between friends,"

1177
01:48:58,767 --> 01:49:01,186
"Ben did not object too heartily,"

1178
01:49:01,228 --> 01:49:06,816
considering the trouble he could receive
from the rest of the towns-people
when they realized what had happened.

1179
01:49:06,983 --> 01:49:10,320
"Perhaps they'd all be relieved
that she was out of their lives,"

1180
01:49:10,737 --> 01:49:14,198
but somehow Grace wasn't too sure of that.

1181
01:49:14,824 --> 01:49:21,539
"Ben agreed to drive her, even though he wasn't
out to profit from other folks' misfortunes, as he put it."

1182
01:49:21,539 --> 01:49:25,584
- I don't wanna profit from other folks' misfortunes.
- No..

1183
01:49:25,668 --> 01:49:30,381
[Narrator] The fact was that Ben would have driven
to the gates of Hell and back for ten dollars

1184
01:49:30,631 --> 01:49:34,760
And the criminal aspect bugged him less
than Grace would ever have guessed;

1185
01:49:34,843 --> 01:49:38,263
he had freighted all kinds of things
in his day.

1186
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:42,184
The plan was for Grace to hide
among the apples.

1187
01:49:42,309 --> 01:49:47,313
"Knowing the exact time to harvest is the
greatest art of all, Chuck had said,"

1188
01:49:47,522 --> 01:49:52,485
and the time had come
for the apples and for Grace.

1189
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:54,487
"Grace, where've you been?"

1190
01:49:54,612 --> 01:49:58,574
If I'd displayed the same indifference
to the timing of my chores I'd be in for a whippin'

1191
01:49:58,616 --> 01:50:00,117
Now get a move on!

1192
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:04,705
"I'm sorry, Olivia.
I had to talk to Ben about something."

1193
01:50:04,789 --> 01:50:06,123
June is near to bursting.

1194
01:50:06,248 --> 01:50:08,918
"She can't use the pot on her own,
as you well know."

1195
01:50:08,918 --> 01:50:12,796
It ain't fittin' to toy with her just 'cause
she's crippled and can't help herself.

1196
01:50:17,134 --> 01:50:25,308
"[Narrator] The evening before the escape
Tom tactically thought it best not to press
his desires of the flesh too hard upon Grace,"

1197
01:50:25,517 --> 01:50:29,896
and instead he adopted a more
sensitive approach.

1198
01:50:31,815 --> 01:50:38,112
But there is a right and a wrong time
to plant seeds and you can't plant seeds in the winter.

1199
01:50:39,363 --> 01:50:43,451
That's true.
But I love you...

1200
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,454
- I know.
- And you love me

1201
01:50:46,787 --> 01:50:49,790
and we will meet again in love
and in freedom.

1202
01:50:49,874 --> 01:50:51,667
Absolutely.

1203
01:50:52,710 --> 01:50:56,672
"I shouldn't be ashamed wanting you, should I?
It's nothing to be ashamed of."

1204
01:50:56,672 --> 01:50:57,923
No...

1205
01:50:59,174 --> 01:51:02,844
- No.
- No.. no. It's lovely. It's lovely that we want each other.

1206
01:51:04,846 --> 01:51:07,182
- But not this way.
- No.

1207
01:51:07,516 --> 01:51:09,309
It's not right.

1208
01:51:20,319 --> 01:51:25,116
"[Narrator] The next morning, when Grace
wanted to slip down to Ben's as invisibly as possible,"

1209
01:51:25,241 --> 01:51:30,246
it seemed to Grace that the entire township
was up and about at the same time.

1210
01:51:30,913 --> 01:51:33,290
"- Grace!
- Yes, Vera.."

1211
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:38,837
"If you think that by hitting my child you can
get out of working for me, think again."

1212
01:51:38,962 --> 01:51:40,756
"Why don't you just come by as planned,"

1213
01:51:40,756 --> 01:51:45,802
and we'll find something
where you won't be able to harm anyone.

1214
01:51:45,927 --> 01:51:48,847
- At twelve o'clock?
- Yes.

1215
01:51:49,014 --> 01:51:52,726
Why are you taking your copious
belongings around with you?

1216
01:51:52,934 --> 01:51:54,894
Afraid you are gonna loose them?

1217
01:51:55,103 --> 01:51:58,064
"Grace, Ben's hauling apples today
so we won't be loading glasses."

1218
01:51:58,398 --> 01:52:02,276
But that don't mean you're off work.
Dad wants you to repack the whole last load.

1219
01:52:02,985 --> 01:52:05,446
Maybe you can do it better
and we'll have an extra crate.

1220
01:52:05,988 --> 01:52:10,534
"An old crate like that may not have much
value in your eyes, but this is Dogville."

1221
01:52:10,826 --> 01:52:12,661
We're not wealthy here.

1222
01:52:13,662 --> 01:52:17,750
"And if your hands get a bit red, well,
I've got a tip about something you can rub on 'em."

1223
01:52:17,833 --> 01:52:20,878
"- Grace!
- Oh, Martha.."

1224
01:52:23,213 --> 01:52:25,799
We have to wash the flagstones
at the foot of the steps again.

1225
01:52:25,882 --> 01:52:28,593
Dirt has gone blown under the door.
I can't get the door open.

1226
01:52:28,635 --> 01:52:33,848
Where have you been?
Harvest is the holiest time of the year.

1227
01:52:34,432 --> 01:52:36,726
Does it not sound like something
you could have said?

1228
01:52:37,602 --> 01:52:42,815
"I'll be down in a minute, Chuck.
I'll bring the crates down."

1229
01:52:43,483 --> 01:52:44,359
Good.

1230
01:52:45,151 --> 01:52:47,361
"[Narrator] As Grace hastened to the garage,"

1231
01:52:47,487 --> 01:52:52,825
she grew more and more pleased with
the decision to keep her departure under wrap.

1232
01:52:53,868 --> 01:52:58,205
There was actually quite a bit of work
Dogville didn't need doing

1233
01:52:58,247 --> 01:53:02,418
that its residents would have to carry out
for themselves in future.

1234
01:53:03,502 --> 01:53:08,882
"Yeah, er, Grace, I don't like having to say this,
but I'd like to ask if I could have the money up front."

1235
01:53:09,591 --> 01:53:12,594
"See, it's always the way in the freight industry."

1236
01:53:12,636 --> 01:53:17,182
"Once you deliver a load you ain't got much
to bargain with, if you catch my drift."

1237
01:53:17,265 --> 01:53:19,142
Of course. Here's the money.

1238
01:53:19,225 --> 01:53:22,228
"Not that this is a professional job,
of course."

1239
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:24,063
"- Don't get out...
- All right, Ben."

1240
01:53:24,647 --> 01:53:25,773
'till I give the say-so!

1241
01:53:47,002 --> 01:53:52,924
"[Narrator] Canyon Road snaked down the valley
and away, and Grace went too,"

1242
01:53:53,258 --> 01:54:00,390
and with every bend the township and its noises
faded ever more mercifully behind her.

1243
01:54:49,687 --> 01:54:51,564
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah.

1244
01:54:52,231 --> 01:54:55,610
There are a hell lot of.. a lot of police up ahead.

1245
01:54:57,278 --> 01:54:59,196
I wasn't expecting that.

1246
01:55:00,573 --> 01:55:05,786
It's more dangerous than I thought.
We'll have to go back.

1247
01:55:07,830 --> 01:55:09,748
No! we can't do that.

1248
01:55:11,542 --> 01:55:12,584
It's just....

1249
01:55:12,918 --> 01:55:19,925
"if this was a professional transport job,
you know, paid proper like...it'd be a lot easier, but..."

1250
01:55:22,135 --> 01:55:24,054
But it's been paid for...

1251
01:55:24,512 --> 01:55:32,311
"Yeah, but, in the freight industry carrying
dangerous load it cost more."

1252
01:55:33,312 --> 01:55:35,690
"A surcharge, they call it."

1253
01:55:36,816 --> 01:55:42,780
"If this were a professional job,
I could just charge you."

1254
01:55:45,282 --> 01:55:47,993
"But Bun, I don't have any more money."

1255
01:55:53,165 --> 01:55:55,792
"Oh, that's no good then."

1256
01:55:59,921 --> 01:56:07,137
"You said once, you said once,
that there aren't many pleasures in my life."

1257
01:56:10,098 --> 01:56:13,226
"And you know, I go to Miss Laura
once a week."

1258
01:56:14,644 --> 01:56:21,651
And you got me to see that it weren't
nothing to be ashamed of.

1259
01:56:26,322 --> 01:56:29,116
I was gonna go there tonight...

1260
01:56:31,618 --> 01:56:35,497
and of course it costs me.

1261
01:56:37,332 --> 01:56:41,586
"I mean, not as much as..."

1262
01:56:43,421 --> 01:56:51,262
"not as much as a surcharge
for dangerous goods, but  still..."

1263
01:56:53,973 --> 01:56:55,975
"it does cost me, you know."

1264
01:56:56,684 --> 01:56:59,353
"No, Ben, no... please don't.."

1265
01:56:59,896 --> 01:57:04,191
"It's not personal, Grace.
It's not personal. I just..."

1266
01:57:05,943 --> 01:57:08,737
"I have to take due payment, that's all."

1267
01:57:09,655 --> 01:57:12,783
I don't .. I don't have a choice.

1268
01:57:13,659 --> 01:57:16,870
I can't buck the freight in this big craft.

1269
01:57:20,415 --> 01:57:26,087
We're parked in the square in Georgetown.
Right outside the church.

1270
01:57:27,422 --> 01:57:29,591
You'd better keep your voice down.

1271
01:57:33,761 --> 01:57:35,346
"No, Ben..."

1272
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:41,144
"This ain't somethin' I'm proud of, Grace.
Don't go thinking that."

1273
01:58:13,925 --> 01:58:22,183
"[Narrator] Grace fell asleep on the long highway,
thanks to her healthy ability to push
any unpleasantness around her far away."

1274
01:58:22,225 --> 01:58:27,396
"A generous God had blessed her with
the rare talent of being able to look ahead,"

1275
01:58:27,855 --> 01:58:29,857
and only ahead.

1276
01:58:31,442 --> 01:58:38,323
"And later when the truck slowed down
about to reach its destination and she slowly
returned to consciousness,"

1277
01:58:38,365 --> 01:58:41,994
she had no way of knowing how long she had slept.

1278
01:58:42,035 --> 01:58:46,915
All she knew was that she would be
happy to see the light of day again.

1279
01:58:49,417 --> 01:58:51,878
And then she heard the dog.

1280
01:58:57,675 --> 01:59:01,179
All your fondness for apples seems
less and less believable.

1281
01:59:02,013 --> 01:59:03,473
You've bruised 'em.

1282
01:59:16,318 --> 01:59:19,321
We had a meeting last night
at the mission house.

1283
01:59:21,698 --> 01:59:25,035
"They said you might be going to try to run away,"

1284
01:59:25,118 --> 01:59:29,706
"so when I discovered you'd hidden
yourself away on my truck,"

1285
01:59:31,124 --> 01:59:34,502
I didn't have no choice but
to bring you back to Dogville.

1286
01:59:36,254 --> 01:59:39,215
In the freight industry we can't take sides.

1287
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:28,679
"[Narrator] It didn't help Grace that the first theft
ever registered in Dogville had taken place
the previous evening,"

1288
02:00:28,721 --> 02:00:33,059
when most people were assembled
for the town meeting.

1289
02:00:33,517 --> 02:00:38,898
Old Tom Edison Senior had a considerable
sum of money stolen from his medicine closet

1290
02:00:38,939 --> 02:00:41,525
"and suspicion soon fell on Grace,"

1291
02:00:41,525 --> 02:00:46,530
who had apparently been planning an escape
that would surely require funding.

1292
02:00:46,905 --> 02:00:51,368
Grace chose to remain silent
in the face of these new charges.

1293
02:00:52,744 --> 02:00:58,708
"And then Bill, who had lately improved his
engineering skills to an astonishing degree,"

1294
02:00:58,959 --> 02:01:04,506
"had, by way of his first design, implemented
a kind of escape prevention mechanism."

1295
02:01:04,923 --> 02:01:10,887
"Beautiful it might not have been,
but effective he dared say it was."

1296
02:01:21,939 --> 02:01:26,402
"Grace, we don't like having to do this."

1297
02:01:27,194 --> 02:01:31,949
We don't have much of a choice
if we are to protect our community.

1298
02:01:32,282 --> 02:01:36,578
Could you... Do you mind moving?
Try moving.

1299
02:01:56,806 --> 02:01:57,932
It works.

1300
02:01:59,141 --> 02:02:05,481
We had to make this heavy enough so that
it can only move where the ground's level.

1301
02:02:05,648 --> 02:02:09,026
And the ground is level in town.

1302
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:16,199
May I go now?

1303
02:02:21,955 --> 02:02:25,458
I have to figure out
how I'm going to get into my house.

1304
02:02:27,627 --> 02:02:31,297
"Or is that part of the punishment,
having to sleep outdoors?"

1305
02:02:31,756 --> 02:02:34,384
"No, no no Grace."

1306
02:02:34,425 --> 02:02:38,596
Don't think of this as punishment.
Not at all!

1307
02:02:39,597 --> 02:02:44,685
"Bill, he made the chain long enough
so that you can sleep in your bed."

1308
02:02:55,696 --> 02:02:57,239
"Grace, six o'clock."

1309
02:03:00,534 --> 02:03:02,828
"Yes, Mrs. Henson."

1310
02:03:31,522 --> 02:03:33,816
I couldn't run the risk of Dad turning me down.

1311
02:03:33,857 --> 02:03:36,610
"But, they think it was me that took the money."

1312
02:03:37,528 --> 02:03:39,571
'Cause I told them so.

1313
02:03:43,658 --> 02:03:45,494
You did what?

1314
02:03:46,161 --> 02:03:49,247
"First they suspected me, but then
I convinced them that it was you,"

1315
02:03:49,289 --> 02:03:52,041
since you were the one
using the medicine closet.

1316
02:03:53,501 --> 02:03:54,419
Why?

1317
02:03:54,961 --> 02:03:56,838
Because I'm here to do the thinking for you.

1318
02:03:56,879 --> 02:04:01,217
"If we are to have the slightest chance
of getting you out of
here,"

1319
02:04:02,552 --> 02:04:05,429
they can never know how close we really are.

1320
02:04:07,056 --> 02:04:10,643
They can't know I'm trying to help you.

1321
02:04:12,811 --> 02:04:16,982
"If they knew it was me that took the money,
I wouldn't be here talking to you now."

1322
02:04:19,985 --> 02:04:22,529
"Please don't disappear, Tom."

1323
02:04:28,535 --> 02:04:30,245
I need you.

1324
02:04:33,331 --> 02:04:36,751
I'll break this one...
with some thinking.

1325
02:04:46,802 --> 02:04:54,310
"[Narrator] It was not Grace's pride that kept
her going during the days when fall came
and the trees were losing their leaves,"

1326
02:04:54,351 --> 02:04:59,731
"but more of the trance-like state that descends
on animals whose lives are threatened,"

1327
02:04:59,731 --> 02:05:04,111
"a state in which the body reacts mechanically,
in a low, tough gear,"

1328
02:05:04,111 --> 02:05:07,155
without too much painful reflection.

1329
02:05:07,197 --> 02:05:11,868
Like a patient passively letting
his disease hold sway.

1330
02:05:12,911 --> 02:05:20,376
"And now that Vera had received proof that it was
in fact Chuck who'd forced his attentions on Grace,"

1331
02:05:20,418 --> 02:05:22,754
she was meaner than ever.

1332
02:05:26,132 --> 02:05:31,637
"Had Grace had friends in Dogville
they, too, fell like the leaves."

1333
02:05:33,222 --> 02:05:40,187
The most towns-people of the male sex now
visited Grace at night to fulfill their sexual needs.

1334
02:05:41,605 --> 02:05:44,483
It had occurred to the children
to give the bell an extra ring

1335
02:05:44,566 --> 02:05:50,197
"every time such an act had been consummated,
much to Martha's confusion."

1336
02:05:52,324 --> 02:05:57,287
But since the chain had been attached
things had become easier for everyone:

1337
02:05:58,788 --> 02:06:02,625
"the harassments in bed did not have to be
kept so secret anymore,"

1338
02:06:02,625 --> 02:06:06,212
because they couldn't really be
compared to a sexual act.

1339
02:06:06,295 --> 02:06:11,217
"They were embarrassing in the way it is
when a hillbilly has his way with a cow,"

1340
02:06:11,259 --> 02:06:12,718
but no more than that.

1341
02:06:14,762 --> 02:06:16,639
Tom saw everything.

1342
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:22,019
"It pained him, and the sexual visits
were a particularly severe blow."

1343
02:06:28,775 --> 02:06:34,197
"But he supported her as best he could,
the way a spider supports,"

1344
02:06:34,239 --> 02:06:37,951
when it has been tangled
in its own web by the wind.

1345
02:06:38,993 --> 02:06:40,078
Tom!

1346
02:06:46,959 --> 02:06:49,837
Everything I tried to do went wrong.

1347
02:06:50,963 --> 02:06:54,258
I can't come up with the answe
I was looking for.

1348
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:59,054
"You'll come up with it, you'll see.
You're very clever."

1349
02:07:00,681 --> 02:07:05,686
- We provoked them.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

1350
02:07:10,732 --> 02:07:14,569
We provoked them.
Now it is time for us to provoke ourselves.

1351
02:07:14,653 --> 02:07:15,904
What do you mean?

1352
02:07:15,946 --> 02:07:20,700
"I mean, by showing them some trust."

1353
02:07:20,784 --> 02:07:25,163
"It all started with a meeting, so it will be
logical to end it with
one, too."

1354
02:07:25,413 --> 02:07:29,625
You'll talk and they'll listen.
They can't refuse to listen.

1355
02:07:31,669 --> 02:07:35,339
- What will I say?
- Everything. You'll say everything.

1356
02:07:35,423 --> 02:07:38,342
"- Everything?
- Yeah, the truth. The Truth."

1357
02:07:38,342 --> 02:07:41,011
Just the truth about each and
every one of them.

1358
02:07:41,011 --> 02:07:43,264
I don't think they are gonna want to hear that.

1359
02:07:43,264 --> 02:07:49,311
"I know, I know. It is like a child
who doesn't want to take his medicine."

1360
02:07:50,729 --> 02:07:56,276
"They'll be furious at first, but in the end
they'll see it is for their own good."

1361
02:07:56,318 --> 02:08:00,196
Just don't be hateful. Don't be reproving.

1362
02:08:01,489 --> 02:08:04,117
"If anybody can do it,
Grace, you can."

1363
02:08:04,909 --> 02:08:12,458
They'll all realize that this weapon and
this understanding and injustice
has only one true victim and that's you.

1364
02:08:12,708 --> 02:08:16,504
And from there it is only
one small step to forgiveness.

1365
02:08:17,672 --> 02:08:22,802
"You've done some hard thinking, Tom Edison."

1366
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:28,390
I'm sure it is an excellent plan.
I'm sure.

1367
02:08:47,784 --> 02:08:53,039
"[Narrator] If forgiveness was close at hand
in the mission house, they were all hiding it well."

1368
02:08:54,499 --> 02:08:57,335
It hadn't been easy for Tom to get them there.

1369
02:08:57,877 --> 02:09:03,924
Appealing to consciences stowed farther
and farther away by their owners every day

1370
02:09:04,049 --> 02:09:10,389
"as if they were as fragile as Henson's
glasses after polishing, had proved quite a task."

1371
02:09:11,056 --> 02:09:15,018
"But if one was going, the others
might as well come along, too,"

1372
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:17,896
so nobody could talk behind anybody's back.

1373
02:09:20,065 --> 02:09:23,527
Tom had set the scene for Grace's speech.

1374
02:09:23,902 --> 02:09:29,449
"Now she'd have to sink or swim,
and sincerity be brought to bear."

1375
02:09:31,201 --> 02:09:35,997
While Grace addressed the silent congregation
in the mission house on Elm Street

1376
02:09:36,039 --> 02:09:40,251
the first of the early autumn snowstorms
embraced the town.

1377
02:09:40,835 --> 02:09:47,174
The snowflakes dusted down over the old
buildings as if this were just any old town.

1378
02:09:47,550 --> 02:09:51,637
"And they played in the brances and twigs
from which the apples had hung,"

1379
02:09:51,762 --> 02:09:56,517
but luckily the harvest was home and
via the freight industry had found a market

1380
02:09:56,558 --> 02:09:59,728
despite the ever disappointing prices.

1381
02:09:59,978 --> 02:10:02,939
Grace had presented her story with clarity.

1382
02:10:02,939 --> 02:10:06,067
She had not embellished or understated.

1383
02:10:06,067 --> 02:10:11,156
"And just as she finished the snowflakes
all at once stopped tumbling down,"

1384
02:10:11,948 --> 02:10:19,372
"leaving Dogville clad in the daintiest,
whitest blanket of snow imaginable."

1385
02:10:37,890 --> 02:10:40,142
I don't think it went very well.

1386
02:10:40,350 --> 02:10:43,228
It's fine. You did good.

1387
02:10:51,277 --> 02:10:55,865
"[Narrator] The snow had come early,
perhaps too early."

1388
02:10:55,990 --> 02:10:59,327
A misplaced augury of conciliation.

1389
02:11:00,370 --> 02:11:03,164
"Tom looked around, worried:"

1390
02:11:03,206 --> 02:11:07,251
Vera's teeth were clenched.
She was the first to speak.

1391
02:11:07,293 --> 02:11:09,920
Copious lies. Just lies.

1392
02:11:09,962 --> 02:11:14,550
"Yes, Tom. It doesn't accord with the perceptions
I got of this town and its residents."

1393
02:11:15,384 --> 02:11:19,388
"I'm a doctor, damn it, I don't need
anyone to tell me if I'm sick or not."

1394
02:11:19,388 --> 02:11:21,473
"What do you have to say for yourself, Tom?"

1395
02:11:21,682 --> 02:11:23,976
Maybe it's time you picked sides!

1396
02:11:24,601 --> 02:11:26,853
Are you for us or against us?

1397
02:11:26,895 --> 02:11:29,773
Liz is right. We've been
far too indulgent with Tom.

1398
02:11:29,814 --> 02:11:33,526
"Tom, I got to tell you.
Even I have trouble defending that girl."

1399
02:11:34,069 --> 02:11:38,573
"With your help, which I prefer to think
was accidental, Tom,"

1400
02:11:39,198 --> 02:11:45,997
she has managed to spread bitterness
and troubles throughout this whole town.

1401
02:11:46,038 --> 02:11:48,666
"She has to go.
How do we get rid of her, Tom?"

1402
02:11:48,666 --> 02:11:50,251
"So how do we do it, Tom?"

1403
02:11:50,292 --> 02:11:54,672
"I agree, Tom. You brought her in here.
You got to figure out how to get her out."

1404
02:11:54,713 --> 02:11:57,216
Without her lies and accusations spreading.

1405
02:12:00,219 --> 02:12:02,429
I asked you here to listen.

1406
02:12:05,515 --> 02:12:07,642
You only came to defend yourselves.

1407
02:12:08,101 --> 02:12:12,480
I'm sorry
it's quite a blow to me...

1408
02:12:13,815 --> 02:12:21,698
"to see all of my friends act this way,
so uncivilized."

1409
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:20,212
"Your plan didn't work out very well, did it?"

1410
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:24,007
"- You'll think of another one.
- No,"

1411
02:13:26,176 --> 02:13:29,221
"No more plans, I promise."

1412
02:13:34,601 --> 02:13:37,687
They asked me to choose between you and them.

1413
02:13:39,898 --> 02:13:43,318
That's not difficult on a day like today.
I love you.

1414
02:13:44,485 --> 02:13:51,325
"You may be stronger, it's true,
but the ideals, the ideals we share."

1415
02:13:52,535 --> 02:13:58,040
You're exhausted. Lie down.

1416
02:14:05,089 --> 02:14:10,844
"I've chosen, Grace.
I have chosen you."

1417
02:14:15,390 --> 02:14:20,270
Now it is the time!
The time we've been waiting for.

1418
02:14:25,316 --> 02:14:27,860
We free ourselves of Dogville.

1419
02:14:34,283 --> 02:14:40,831
"You're right. You're right, Tom.
It'd be so easy to make love right now."

1420
02:14:43,042 --> 02:14:48,922
They may kill us any minute..
It would be the perfect romantic ending.

1421
02:14:49,006 --> 02:14:51,675
I know. I feel it too. I love you.

1422
02:14:55,387 --> 02:14:58,098
"It would be so beautiful, but from ..."

1423
02:14:59,474 --> 02:15:04,229
"from the point of view of our love,
so completely wrong."

1424
02:15:08,399 --> 02:15:11,486
We were to meet in freedom.

1425
02:15:24,206 --> 02:15:26,500
"You're cold now, Grace."

1426
02:15:36,218 --> 02:15:40,680
I've just rejected everybody
I've ever known in your favor.

1427
02:15:43,016 --> 02:15:48,313
"Wouldn't it be worth compromising,
just one of your ideals just a little to ease my pain?"

1428
02:15:51,649 --> 02:15:54,902
"Everybody in this town has
had your body, but me."

1429
02:15:55,987 --> 02:15:58,447
We're the ones supposed to be in love.

1430
02:16:01,409 --> 02:16:03,744
My darling Tom.

1431
02:16:07,456 --> 02:16:10,584
You can have me if you want me.

1432
02:16:13,629 --> 02:16:16,089
Just do what the others do.

1433
02:16:17,466 --> 02:16:19,092
Threaten me...

1434
02:16:19,509 --> 02:16:25,348
"Tell me that you'll turn me in to the law,
to the gangsters and I promise you,"

1435
02:16:26,683 --> 02:16:30,186
you can take whatever it is you want from me.

1436
02:16:31,729 --> 02:16:33,690
I trust you...

1437
02:16:36,150 --> 02:16:39,821
but maybe you don't trust yourself?

1438
02:16:40,446 --> 02:16:46,994
"Perhaps you've been tempted, you've been
tempted to join the others and force me."

1439
02:16:46,994 --> 02:16:50,122
Perhaps that's why you're so upset.

1440
02:16:50,331 --> 02:16:52,916
All I've ever tried to do is help you.

1441
02:16:53,375 --> 02:16:58,130
I'm just asking if you're afraid
that you could be so human.

1442
02:16:58,255 --> 02:17:01,091
"No, I'm not afraid of that.
Not in the least."

1443
02:17:02,426 --> 02:17:04,094
Good.

1444
02:17:08,556 --> 02:17:11,643
Let tomorrow bring that it's gonna bring.

1445
02:17:14,229 --> 02:17:19,901
"It's not a crime to doubt yourself, Tom.."

1446
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:24,614
but it's wonderful that you don't.

1447
02:17:27,116 --> 02:17:29,160
I can't find the rest.

1448
02:17:32,329 --> 02:17:35,040
Maybe I should go out
for a couple of minutes.

1449
02:17:37,209 --> 02:17:39,670
Take a walk or something...
I don't know.

1450
02:17:42,172 --> 02:17:44,383
To get it all out of my system.

1451
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:48,762
Trudge the streets..

1452
02:17:49,763 --> 02:17:53,767
Listen to the wind as it passes through
the woods up through the valley

1453
02:17:54,684 --> 02:17:56,227
and all that.

1454
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:02,108
"You go to sleep, though..."

1455
02:18:05,903 --> 02:18:12,701
You go to sleep
and I will be back very soon.

1456
02:18:20,626 --> 02:18:23,545
[Narrator] Of course it was all a load of nonsense.

1457
02:18:23,629 --> 02:18:28,884
"If anybody was capable of keeping track
of ideals and reality, he was."

1458
02:18:29,009 --> 02:18:34,723
"After all, it was his job.
Moral issues were his home ground."

1459
02:18:35,598 --> 02:18:40,687
To think that he might doubt his own purity
was really to think very little of him.

1460
02:18:41,562 --> 02:18:43,981
Tom was angry.

1461
02:18:46,484 --> 02:18:50,071
"And in the midst of it all,
he discovered why."

1462
02:18:50,738 --> 02:18:53,824
"It was not because of he'd been wrongly accused,"

1463
02:18:53,866 --> 02:18:56,702
but because the charges were true!

1464
02:18:58,245 --> 02:19:03,959
His anger consisted of a most unpleasant
feeling of being found out!

1465
02:19:06,878 --> 02:19:10,132
It was all quite a blow to the young philosopher!

1466
02:19:10,132 --> 02:19:16,888
"And realistically enough, he thought
that if the doubt was already present, it could grow."

1467
02:19:16,930 --> 02:19:23,269
Perhaps so great that one day it would prove
detrimental to his entire moral mission.

1468
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:25,730
Tom stopped.

1469
02:19:25,772 --> 02:19:31,193
He almost began to shake when the threat
to his career as a writer dawned upon him.

1470
02:19:31,277 --> 02:19:37,032
It didn't take him long to agree with himself
that the risk was too great to run.

1471
02:19:37,032 --> 02:19:41,704
The danger Grace was to the town
she was also to him!

1472
02:19:41,870 --> 02:19:44,039
Tom did not like it.

1473
02:19:44,081 --> 02:19:48,168
And he was man enough
to take action to prevent it.

1474
02:19:50,629 --> 02:19:57,302
Fortunately Tom was as conscientious
as regards his future profession as he was practical.

1475
02:19:57,344 --> 02:20:01,556
"He allowed sincerity and ideals
plenty of room in his life,"

1476
02:20:01,598 --> 02:20:05,435
"without getting ""sentimental"" about it,
as he would put it."

1477
02:20:06,311 --> 02:20:15,277
"Throwing away a document that might be
of significance to Tom and with him future generation
of readers as the basis of a novel or indeed a trilogy,"

1478
02:20:15,444 --> 02:20:18,948
"was not an act he was so stupid to commit,"

1479
02:20:18,948 --> 02:20:24,036
although he had to admit that in a moment
of weakness he might have said he would.

1480
02:20:27,539 --> 02:20:34,254
"Before returning to the meeting that night
Tom opened the little drawer he had open
the night of Grace's arrival,"

1481
02:20:35,005 --> 02:20:37,048
and found it still there:

1482
02:20:37,382 --> 02:20:40,260
the card from the gangster in the car.

1483
02:21:01,530 --> 02:21:05,284
"[Narrator] The next day the sun was shining
in the brisk autumn sky,"

1484
02:21:05,409 --> 02:21:07,911
and the snow was long since gone.

1485
02:21:09,955 --> 02:21:14,209
For the first time for ages the pile driver
could be heard in the marshlands

1486
02:21:14,251 --> 02:21:20,632
as it hammered in the piles for what might
or what might not be a penitentiary.

1487
02:21:20,799 --> 02:21:27,013
"Grace opened her eyes after an almost
unconscious sleep, and was confused."

1488
02:21:27,055 --> 02:21:32,143
"Judging by the light coming through the cracks
in the walls, it had to be nearly midday."

1489
02:21:32,226 --> 02:21:37,440
"The grey hour as Jack McKay
for some reason called noon in Dogville,"

1490
02:21:37,607 --> 02:21:44,864
"being a man of many ideas and proclivities,
quite a few of which Grace would prefer to remain ignorant of."

1491
02:21:45,781 --> 02:21:48,325
But why had nobody roused her?

1492
02:21:48,325 --> 02:21:50,702
Nobody had hammered furiously at her door.

1493
02:21:50,744 --> 02:21:55,999
Not a child had thrown mud into her bed
or broken her remaining windowpanes.

1494
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,336
Now she remembered.

1495
02:21:59,336 --> 02:22:04,674
"She recalled the meeting the previous day,
and puzzled still more."

1496
02:22:04,966 --> 02:22:10,555
Why had she not been confronted with
the outcome of that meeting? Or even killed?

1497
02:22:11,139 --> 02:22:15,810
It was quite unlike Dogville to restrain
its indignation at any point.

1498
02:22:16,018 --> 02:22:19,188
Perhaps things had turned out well after all?

1499
02:22:19,188 --> 02:22:22,566
"- Good morning, Mrs. Henson.
- Oh.. good morning?"

1500
02:22:22,608 --> 02:22:27,613
I would have come earlier. I overslept.

1501
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:31,158
"Oh, never mind.
Liz put her back into it htis morning."

1502
02:22:32,618 --> 02:22:35,537
We thought some time off would be good for you.

1503
02:22:39,041 --> 02:22:41,293
That was quite a speech you made yesterday.

1504
02:22:41,585 --> 02:22:44,045
It gave us all something to think about.

1505
02:22:48,216 --> 02:22:50,802
"- Hello, Liz!
- Hi, Grace.."

1506
02:22:58,017 --> 02:23:00,311
I overslept.

1507
02:23:01,229 --> 02:23:04,648
- Good morning Miss Grace?
- Good morning..

1508
02:23:04,648 --> 02:23:08,736
- How are you this morning?
- I overslept.

1509
02:23:08,736 --> 02:23:10,863
"Oh, that's all right."

1510
02:23:16,827 --> 02:23:20,414
"Tom. Tom, I think it's Grace."

1511
02:23:20,998 --> 02:23:26,503
"Hello, Grace. Two seconds..
Good news."

1512
02:23:35,094 --> 02:23:37,513
I went back to the meeting last night.

1513
02:23:39,348 --> 02:23:42,185
I wasn't going to let them get off so easily.

1514
02:23:44,020 --> 02:23:46,856
But I'll be damned if the mood hadn't changed.

1515
02:23:48,149 --> 02:23:52,695
"I wouldn't say we won exactly, not exactly,
but I think something very good can come out of this,"

1516
02:23:52,820 --> 02:23:54,988
- something very good.
- Why didn't you come back and tell me?

1517
02:23:55,030 --> 02:23:58,117
"I did, but you were asleep."

1518
02:23:58,575 --> 02:24:01,036
"And you know,
you looked like you needed it.."

1519
02:24:02,287 --> 02:24:05,499
and that made me suggest
that maybe you should have some time off.

1520
02:24:05,540 --> 02:24:10,503
"And you know,
not one single person objected."

1521
02:24:14,716 --> 02:24:16,426
That sounds wonderful.

1522
02:24:16,551 --> 02:24:18,511
"I know it does, doesn't it?"

1523
02:24:19,220 --> 02:24:22,640
The people of this town
they surprise me again and again.

1524
02:24:24,016 --> 02:24:27,520
I might even have to revise
my theories a little bit.

1525
02:24:27,561 --> 02:24:30,064
You know how much I hate
doing that kind of thing.

1526
02:24:32,358 --> 02:24:40,782
"You know, Grace, last night when I came back
and I saw you lying there asleep so sweetly,"

1527
02:24:41,158 --> 02:24:46,580
I was suddenly inspired.
I wrote the first chapter of a story.

1528
02:24:46,705 --> 02:24:49,040
A story about a small town.

1529
02:24:49,624 --> 02:24:51,668
Guess where I got the inspiration?

1530
02:24:52,502 --> 02:24:55,505
But I haven't come up with a name
for the town yet.

1531
02:24:56,673 --> 02:24:59,717
- Why not just call it Dogville?
- Wouldn't work.

1532
02:25:00,468 --> 02:25:04,806
"No, it wouldn't work. It's got to be universal.
Lot of writers make that mistake, you see."

1533
02:25:05,556 --> 02:25:07,725
"Hey, do you want me to read it to you?"

1534
02:25:08,309 --> 02:25:10,895
"If there is any love in it, it comes from you..."

1535
02:25:10,936 --> 02:25:13,856
"Would you be offended, if I said no?"

1536
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:19,319
"- No.
- If I really do have the day to myself, I..."

1537
02:25:19,653 --> 02:25:22,072
No. No..

1538
02:25:23,532 --> 02:25:27,869
Two people only hurt each other if they
doubt the love they have for one another.

1539
02:25:29,663 --> 02:25:31,665
You can read it some other time.

1540
02:25:33,208 --> 02:25:37,295
You sit down some place
and gaze out at the mountains.

1541
02:25:37,629 --> 02:25:39,714
It's what the girl in my novel does.

1542
02:25:43,092 --> 02:25:46,721
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you. Good news!

1543
02:25:52,184 --> 02:25:57,189
"[Narrator] Sensibly, Grace chose to hope
for the best rather than fear the worst,"

1544
02:25:57,273 --> 02:26:01,485
"and planned to spend the day calmly
washing her clothes and herself,"

1545
02:26:01,527 --> 02:26:09,159
"which, for some reason or another, she was sure
none of the characters from Tom's
fictitious township would dream of doing."

1546
02:26:12,746 --> 02:26:16,791
And then it was as if Dogville just waited.

1547
02:26:17,876 --> 02:26:23,172
"Even the wind dropped,
leaving the town in an unfamiliar calm."

1548
02:26:24,048 --> 02:26:28,177
"as if somebody had put a large
cheese dish cover over it,"

1549
02:26:28,970 --> 02:26:33,891
and created the kind of quietness
that descends while you are awaiting visitors.

1550
02:26:36,143 --> 02:26:43,442
"After two days off Grace had been put back
to work, but the quietness remained."

1551
02:26:43,692 --> 02:26:52,659
Indeed it intensified until on the fifth day
it swelled into a strange mood

1552
02:26:52,701 --> 02:26:56,830
"that, all of a sudden, brought all the citizens
to the street to listen."

1553
02:26:59,374 --> 02:27:03,044
"They asked each other
if the phone was really still down,"

1554
02:27:03,378 --> 02:27:08,299
or if they'd heard about Ben having had to turn
his truck around on his way to Georgetown

1555
02:27:08,341 --> 02:27:12,803
that very morning on account
of a large tree blocking the road.

1556
02:27:13,137 --> 02:27:15,097
They were not worried.

1557
02:27:15,473 --> 02:27:21,687
"worried was not the right word,
and then Tom spotted the cars."

1558
02:27:23,731 --> 02:27:25,816
Tom has binoculars.
But you can see 'em with the naked eyes.

1559
02:27:25,899 --> 02:27:27,484
There must be at least eight!

1560
02:27:27,484 --> 02:27:29,153
I thought the road was blocked.

1561
02:27:29,194 --> 02:27:31,488
They must have come through
before the tree came down.

1562
02:27:34,574 --> 02:27:38,245
June's bed! The sheets need changing.
I'll be there in a minute.

1563
02:27:39,246 --> 02:27:40,497
"Hello, June."

1564
02:27:42,832 --> 02:27:46,961
"[Narrator] Grace had just started on the bed,
which June had soiled yet again,"

1565
02:27:47,295 --> 02:27:51,924
when an irritating feeling of wasting her time
forced itself upon her.

1566
02:27:53,134 --> 02:27:56,470
And it was without thinking
she then said the words:

1567
02:27:56,596 --> 02:27:58,931
Nobody gonna sleep here.

1568
02:28:03,936 --> 02:28:06,563
"[Narrator] She didn't say them out loud,"

1569
02:28:06,563 --> 02:28:11,777
but even so she was startled by the uttrance
that had urged itself upon her.

1570
02:28:13,528 --> 02:28:16,823
Where had these ominous words come from?

1571
02:28:26,124 --> 02:28:31,004
Darkness was falling as Grace made
her way home from work that evening.

1572
02:28:31,212 --> 02:28:36,801
The people on the square overlooking the valley
had finally given up hope of seeing anything else

1573
02:28:36,843 --> 02:28:38,886
now the light had faded.

1574
02:28:38,928 --> 02:28:42,390
They trudged up Elm Street in disappointment.

1575
02:28:47,061 --> 02:28:48,687
"- Tom?
- Hi, Grace."

1576
02:28:48,687 --> 02:28:53,609
"There were some cars, but it's too dark,
we can't see any more."

1577
02:28:53,734 --> 02:28:56,528
We haven't seen much of each other.

1578
02:28:57,112 --> 02:29:00,157
"Yah, I know. I've been busy
with my book, you know."

1579
02:29:00,157 --> 02:29:01,950
Can I ask you something?

1580
02:29:02,826 --> 02:29:04,452
"Yeah, anything."

1581
02:29:07,997 --> 02:29:10,875
"You couldn't bring yourself
to throw it away, could you?"

1582
02:29:12,543 --> 02:29:16,005
The number he gave you that night.
You couldn't throw it away.

1583
02:29:16,297 --> 02:29:21,302
I told yhou how dangerous that man was.
That was stupid.

1584
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:33,897
"[Narrator] Stupid or not, Tom was soon
a passionate spokesman for locking Grace
in her shed that night."

1585
02:29:35,440 --> 02:29:40,195
If the vehicles were indeed a sign
that the call Tom had placed five days earlier

1586
02:29:40,278 --> 02:29:44,991
on be half of the community to the number
indicated on the card from his bureau drawer

1587
02:29:45,116 --> 02:29:47,077
"had at last led to action,"

1588
02:29:47,118 --> 02:29:50,330
"and Grace was now to be eliminated from their lives,"

1589
02:29:50,371 --> 02:29:54,584
it would surely look good
if the town had also locked her up.

1590
02:29:56,753 --> 02:30:00,756
Grace was lying on the bed
when Jason was sent up with the key.

1591
02:30:00,965 --> 02:30:03,509
"Grace heard it turn in the lock,"

1592
02:30:03,551 --> 02:30:11,809
but she was deeply absorbed by arguments
and thoughts on matters she had otherwise
avoided for the best part of a
year now.

1593
02:30:30,577 --> 02:30:34,956
From the moment when they'd finally heard
the sound of vehicles starting one after the other

1594
02:30:34,998 --> 02:30:37,083
"from the direction of the edge of the woods,"

1595
02:30:37,125 --> 02:30:39,627
things had moved rapidly.

1596
02:30:40,086 --> 02:30:43,965
Tom had arranged a delegation
to provide a proper reception.

1597
02:30:44,715 --> 02:30:50,137
"Dogville might be off the beaten track,
but it was hospitable, nevertheless."

1598
02:31:03,150 --> 02:31:05,277
Welcome gentlemen. Welcome.

1599
02:31:05,402 --> 02:31:07,863
The town places itself at your disposal!

1600
02:31:07,904 --> 02:31:11,116
I should have a large key to give to you.
But I only have this small one.

1601
02:31:11,157 --> 02:31:13,410
- Where is she?
- Secured by this very key.

1602
02:31:13,451 --> 02:31:14,994
Where is she?

1603
02:31:15,412 --> 02:31:18,623
Okay. If you are wondering about that sound.

1604
02:31:18,665 --> 02:31:22,085
The driving piles for the new penitentiary.

1605
02:31:22,126 --> 02:31:27,089
"Tell me, has the crime rate really gone up
in this country, as we are lead to believe?"

1606
02:31:27,131 --> 02:31:33,471
"Maybe people just regard things as criminal,
because they envy their success?"

1607
02:31:33,512 --> 02:31:37,308
What's your opinion on the subject?

1608
02:31:37,933 --> 02:31:42,521
Maybe you have none.
I'll get the door... sorry.

1609
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:48,276
Voila! As the French might say.

1610
02:31:48,485 --> 02:31:50,111
What the hell is this?

1611
02:31:50,529 --> 02:31:52,030
Who did that?

1612
02:31:52,113 --> 02:31:54,783
"Billy, put your hand up,
put your hand up."

1613
02:32:03,458 --> 02:32:08,546
"We felt safer, when she had the chain on.
You are probably more adapted at handling her kind."

1614
02:32:10,715 --> 02:32:16,095
None of us feel able to accept money
for just helping people.

1615
02:32:16,178 --> 02:32:20,808
I mean not unless it would make you
feel better to diverst yourself.

1616
02:32:20,808 --> 02:32:23,143
- Shut the hell up!
- Absolutely.

1617
02:32:27,731 --> 02:32:34,487
"[Narrator] Grace was no expert in exclusive
automobiles, yet she recognized with no difficulty"

1618
02:32:34,487 --> 02:32:39,534
the sound of vehicle that was rounding the corner
from Canyon Road at that very moment.

1619
02:32:40,785 --> 02:32:48,709
"Alas, in Grace's memory the legendary purr
of the Cadillac series 355C was inextricably linked"

1620
02:32:48,793 --> 02:32:52,421
"with another, rather less sophisticated sound:"

1621
02:32:52,630 --> 02:32:56,550
that of gunfire directed against her person.

1622
02:33:20,532 --> 02:33:21,741
Don't..!

1623
02:33:46,140 --> 02:33:50,102
You need to justify your actions
before you shoot us.

1624
02:33:51,478 --> 02:33:53,480
That's new.

1625
02:33:57,526 --> 02:34:01,696
"That could be interpreted as weakness,
Daddy... I'm disappointed in you!"

1626
02:34:02,739 --> 02:34:04,032
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

1627
02:34:04,032 --> 02:34:06,201
You shot at me before.

1628
02:34:06,576 --> 02:34:12,582
"Yes, I'm sorry. I regret that."

1629
02:34:12,999 --> 02:34:14,750
You ran away.

1630
02:34:15,126 --> 02:34:19,422
But shooting at you certainly
didn't help matters.

1631
02:34:19,547 --> 02:34:22,716
"Of course not.
You're far, far too stubborn."

1632
02:34:25,386 --> 02:34:27,805
"If you don't want to kill me,
then why did you come?"

1633
02:34:27,805 --> 02:34:32,476
"Our last conversation, the one in which
you told me what it was you didn't like about me"

1634
02:34:32,517 --> 02:34:36,021
"never really concluded, as you ran away."

1635
02:34:36,063 --> 02:34:39,566
I should be allowed to tell you
what I don't like about you.

1636
02:34:39,566 --> 02:34:45,405
That I believe would be
a rule of polite conversation.

1637
02:34:45,530 --> 02:34:47,699
That's why you showed up?

1638
02:34:50,576 --> 02:34:52,954
And you call me stubborn.

1639
02:34:53,204 --> 02:34:57,375
You're sure you're not here to force me
to go back and become like you?

1640
02:34:57,583 --> 02:35:03,964
"If I thought there was a chance of forcing you,
but of course that will never happen."

1641
02:35:04,381 --> 02:35:12,473
You are more than welcome to return home
and become my daughter again anytime

1642
02:35:12,681 --> 02:35:22,732
and I would even begin to share my power
and responsibility with you if you did.

1643
02:35:22,941 --> 02:35:25,652
Not that you care.

1644
02:35:25,777 --> 02:35:27,278
So what is it?

1645
02:35:27,737 --> 02:35:30,865
"What is it, the thing...
the thing that you don't like about me?"

1646
02:35:30,907 --> 02:35:33,368
It was a word you used that provoked me.

1647
02:35:33,409 --> 02:35:35,953
You called me arrogant.

1648
02:35:36,204 --> 02:35:40,124
"To plunder, as it were, a God given right.
I'd call that arrogant, daddy."

1649
02:35:40,166 --> 02:35:43,377
But that is exactly what I don't like about you.

1650
02:35:43,419 --> 02:35:45,129
It is you that is arrogant.

1651
02:35:45,212 --> 02:35:47,464
That's what you came here to say?

1652
02:35:50,884 --> 02:35:54,513
"I'm not the one passing judgement, Daddy.
You are."

1653
02:35:55,597 --> 02:36:00,060
"You do not pass judgement,
because you sympathize with them."

1654
02:36:00,102 --> 02:36:06,942
"A deprived childhood and a homicide
really isn't necessarily a homicide, right?"

1655
02:36:07,484 --> 02:36:10,195
The only thing you can blame is circumstances.

1656
02:36:10,236 --> 02:36:15,074
"Rapists and murderers may be the victims,
according to you."

1657
02:36:15,158 --> 02:36:18,411
"But I, I call them dogs,"

1658
02:36:18,453 --> 02:36:22,707
and if they're lapping up their own vomit
the only way to stop them is with the lash.

1659
02:36:22,748 --> 02:36:25,001
But dogs only obey their own nature.

1660
02:36:25,042 --> 02:36:27,586
So why shouldn't we forgive them?

1661
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:30,881
"Dogs can be taught many useful things,"

1662
02:36:31,006 --> 02:36:36,261
but not if we forgive them
every time they obey their own nature.

1663
02:36:47,814 --> 02:36:53,027
So I'm arrogant. I'm arrogant
because I forgive them?

1664
02:36:53,069 --> 02:36:54,320
My God..

1665
02:36:54,571 --> 02:36:58,491
Can't you see how condescending
you are when you say that?

1666
02:36:58,950 --> 02:37:07,541
"You have this preconceived notion
that nobody, listne, that nobody can't possibly attain"

1667
02:37:07,583 --> 02:37:11,795
"the same high ethical standards as you,
so you exonorate them."

1668
02:37:11,879 --> 02:37:17,009
I can not think of anything
more arrogant than that.

1669
02:37:17,051 --> 02:37:23,265
"You, my child... my dear child
you forgive others with excuses"

1670
02:37:23,348 --> 02:37:26,101
that you would never in the world
permit for yourself.

1671
02:37:26,101 --> 02:37:28,812
Why shouldn't I be merciful?
Why?

1672
02:37:28,854 --> 02:37:34,192
"No no no.. You should be merciful,
when there is time to be merciful."

1673
02:37:34,317 --> 02:37:39,781
But you must maintain your own standard.
You owe them that. You owe them that.

1674
02:37:40,573 --> 02:37:46,829
"The penalty you deserve for your transgressions,
they deserve for their transgressions."

1675
02:37:46,871 --> 02:37:48,331
They are human beings.

1676
02:37:48,331 --> 02:37:52,793
No no no.. Does every human being
need to be accountable for their action?

1677
02:37:52,835 --> 02:37:55,671
Of course they do.
But you don't even give them that chance.

1678
02:37:55,713 --> 02:37:58,298
All that is extremely arrogant.

1679
02:37:58,298 --> 02:38:01,677
I love you. I love you. I love you to death.

1680
02:38:02,052 --> 02:38:05,972
But you are the most arrogant person
I've ever met.

1681
02:38:06,014 --> 02:38:08,225
And you call me arrogant!

1682
02:38:12,312 --> 02:38:16,357
I have no more to say.

1683
02:38:19,194 --> 02:38:23,197
You are arrogant. I'm arrogant.
You've said it. Now you can leave.

1684
02:38:23,197 --> 02:38:25,992
"And without my daughter, I suppose?"

1685
02:38:31,956 --> 02:38:34,375
"- I said, without my daughter?
- Hmm, yes!"

1686
02:38:35,793 --> 02:38:38,462
- Well..
- Yes.

1687
02:38:38,545 --> 02:38:48,764
"Well, you decide. you decide...
Grace, they say you are having some trouble here."

1688
02:38:49,473 --> 02:38:54,144
No. No more trouble than back home.

1689
02:38:54,394 --> 02:38:56,855
I'll give you a little time to think about this.

1690
02:38:56,896 --> 02:39:00,024
- Perhaps you will change your mind.
- I won't.

1691
02:39:00,316 --> 02:39:04,737
"Listen, my love.. power is not so bad..."

1692
02:39:04,821 --> 02:39:11,494
I am sure that you can find a way
to make use of it in your own fashion...

1693
02:39:14,538 --> 02:39:16,540
Take a walk and think about it.

1694
02:39:17,333 --> 02:39:28,677
The people who live here are doing their
best under very hard circumstances.

1695
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:30,804
"If you say so, Grace."

1696
02:39:32,639 --> 02:39:39,771
But is their best really good enough?

1697
02:39:41,648 --> 02:39:42,857
Do they love you?

1698
02:39:53,117 --> 02:39:56,454
Grace had already thought for a long time.

1699
02:39:56,495 --> 02:40:00,541
She had known that if she were not shot
when the gangsters arrived

1700
02:40:00,541 --> 02:40:04,044
"she would be faced with her father's
suggestion that she return, to become"

1701
02:40:04,128 --> 02:40:09,049
a conspirator with him and his gang of
thugs and felons and she did not need any walk

1702
02:40:09,049 --> 02:40:11,718
"to reconsider her response to that,"

1703
02:40:12,719 --> 02:40:18,725
even though the difference betwen the people
she knew back home and the people
she'd met in Dogville had proven

1704
02:40:18,767 --> 02:40:21,936
somewhat slighter than she'd expected.

1705
02:40:23,146 --> 02:40:28,109
Grace looked at the gooseberry bushes
so fragiles in the smooth darkness.

1706
02:40:28,192 --> 02:40:31,571
"It was good to know
that if you did not treat them ill,"

1707
02:40:31,696 --> 02:40:37,118
"they would be there, come sping as always,
and come summer they'd again be bursting"

1708
02:40:37,159 --> 02:40:42,831
"with the quite incomprehensible quantity
of berries that were so good in pies,"

1709
02:40:42,915 --> 02:40:45,000
specially with cinnamon.

1710
02:40:46,669 --> 02:40:49,963
Grace looked around at the frightened faces
behind the windowpanes

1711
02:40:50,047 --> 02:40:56,011
"that were following her every step, and felt
ashamed of being part of inflicting that fear."

1712
02:40:57,762 --> 02:41:02,517
How could she ever hate them for
what was at bottom merely their weakness?

1713
02:41:02,892 --> 02:41:06,563
She would probably have done things
like those that had befallen her

1714
02:41:06,688 --> 02:41:09,190
"if she'd lived in one of these houses,"

1715
02:41:09,274 --> 02:41:13,152
to measure them by her own yardstick
as her father put it.

1716
02:41:13,486 --> 02:41:23,370
"Would she not, in all honesty, have done
the same as Chuck and Vera and Ben and
Mrs. Henson and Tom"

1717
02:41:23,746 --> 02:41:26,707
and all these people in their houses?

1718
02:41:30,169 --> 02:41:32,629
Grace paused.

1719
02:41:33,005 --> 02:41:37,884
"And while she did, the clouds scattered
and let the moonlight through"

1720
02:41:45,433 --> 02:41:49,687
and Dogville underwent another
of little changes of light.

1721
02:42:02,950 --> 02:42:06,579
"It was as if the light,
previously so merciful and faint,"

1722
02:42:06,579 --> 02:42:10,916
finally refused to cover up for the town any longer.

1723
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:17,005
"Suddenly you could no longer imagine a berry
that would appear one day on a gooseberry bush,"

1724
02:42:17,005 --> 02:42:20,384
but only see the thorn that was there right now.

1725
02:42:21,259 --> 02:42:28,558
The light now penetrated every unevenness
and flaw in the buildings... and in...the people!

1726
02:42:31,811 --> 02:42:36,774
And all of a sudden she knew the answer
to her question all too well:

1727
02:42:37,859 --> 02:42:44,031
"If she had acted like them, she could not have
defenced a single one of her actions"

1728
02:42:44,073 --> 02:42:47,076
and could not have condemned them
harshly enough.

1729
02:42:47,910 --> 02:42:53,832
It was as if her sorrow and pain finally
assumed their rightful place.

1730
02:42:54,083 --> 02:42:59,087
"No, what they had done was
not good enough."

1731
02:42:59,504 --> 02:43:04,009
"And if one had the power to put it to rights,
it was one's duty to do so,"

1732
02:43:04,050 --> 02:43:08,513
"for the sake of the other towns,
for the sake of humanity,"

1733
02:43:09,472 --> 02:43:15,520
"and not least, for the sake of the human being
that was Grace herself."

1734
02:43:23,986 --> 02:43:30,284
"If I went back and became your daughter again,"

1735
02:43:30,784 --> 02:43:33,537
when would I be given the power
you're talking about?

1736
02:43:38,041 --> 02:43:40,586
- Now?
- At once!

1737
02:43:40,877 --> 02:43:41,920
Why not?

1738
02:43:48,051 --> 02:43:53,973
So that would mean that I'd also take on
the immediate responsibilities at once.

1739
02:43:54,808 --> 02:43:57,393
I'd be a part in the problem solving...

1740
02:43:58,895 --> 02:44:02,398
like the problem.. of Dogville.

1741
02:44:08,279 --> 02:44:13,242
We can start by shooting a dog
and nailing it to a wall.

1742
02:44:13,367 --> 02:44:20,290
"Over there beneath that lamp, for example.
Well, it might help. It sometimes does."

1743
02:44:20,582 --> 02:44:26,671
"It would only make the town more frightened,
but hardly make it a better place."

1744
02:44:28,882 --> 02:44:30,550
And it could happen again.

1745
02:44:31,426 --> 02:44:43,438
"Somebody happening by,
revealing their frailty."

1746
02:44:47,733 --> 02:44:51,028
"That's what I wanna use the power for,
if you don't mind."

1747
02:44:54,740 --> 02:44:58,869
I wanna make this world a little better.

1748
02:45:03,332 --> 02:45:06,960
"That damn kid won't shup up.
Says he wants to talk to you, Miss."

1749
02:45:07,294 --> 02:45:09,171
Can we just shoot him now?

1750
02:45:10,839 --> 02:45:12,674
Let me talk to him.

1751
02:45:17,262 --> 02:45:19,305
What? What is it?

1752
02:45:21,766 --> 02:45:26,062
"A man can't really be blamed
for being scared now, can he?"

1753
02:45:26,395 --> 02:45:28,356
- No. That's true.
- No!

1754
02:45:28,940 --> 02:45:30,816
"I'm scared, Grace."

1755
02:45:31,067 --> 02:45:33,944
I used you. And I'm sorry.

1756
02:45:34,028 --> 02:45:38,532
"I am stupid, I am.
Maybe even arrogant sometimes."

1757
02:45:40,784 --> 02:45:42,244
"You are, Tom."

1758
02:45:44,788 --> 02:45:49,167
"Although using people is not very charming,
I think you have to agree"

1759
02:45:49,251 --> 02:45:54,089
that this specific illustration
has surpassed all expectations.

1760
02:45:54,130 --> 02:45:56,216
It says so much about being human.

1761
02:45:56,549 --> 02:46:01,137
"It's been painful, but I think you also have to
agree it has been edifying. Wouldn't you say?"

1762
02:46:01,262 --> 02:46:05,141
"Not now, Tom.
Not now."

1763
02:46:09,437 --> 02:46:13,566
"If there is any town in this world
would be better without, this is it."

1764
02:46:19,989 --> 02:46:22,074
Shoot them and burn down the town.

1765
02:46:26,662 --> 02:46:29,665
"What?
Something else, honey?"

1766
02:46:30,624 --> 02:46:33,001
There is a family with kids...

1767
02:46:35,837 --> 02:46:38,923
do the kids first and make the mother watch.

1768
02:46:39,341 --> 02:46:43,303
Tell her you will stop if she can
hold back her tears.

1769
02:46:47,307 --> 02:46:49,392
I owe her that.

1770
02:46:55,898 --> 02:46:59,068
I'm afraid she cries a little too easily.

1771
02:47:01,403 --> 02:47:04,114
We'd better get you out of here.

1772
02:47:05,491 --> 02:47:08,577
"I'm afraid, you've learned
far too much already."

1773
02:47:14,958 --> 02:47:18,670
"Are you cold, Sweetie.
Do you need a wrap?"

1774
02:47:19,462 --> 02:47:20,672
I'm fine.

1775
02:47:23,925 --> 02:47:27,262
You want the curtains opened?
You don't need them anymore.

1776
02:47:27,720 --> 02:47:29,305
What do you think?

1777
02:47:35,353 --> 02:47:41,317
I think we should open them.
I think it's appropriate.

1778
02:49:38,596 --> 02:49:40,098
"Bingo, Grace!"

1779
02:49:42,767 --> 02:49:43,684
Bingo!

1780
02:49:46,103 --> 02:49:49,899
"I have to tell you, your illustration
beat the hell out of mine."

1781
02:49:52,276 --> 02:49:57,030
"It's frightening, yes, but so clear."

1782
02:49:58,407 --> 02:50:04,079
Do you think that I can allow myself
to use it as an inspiration in my writing?

1783
02:50:13,379 --> 02:50:14,839
Goodbye Tom.

1784
02:50:41,740 --> 02:50:46,620
- Somethings you have to do yourself.
- Really

1785
02:50:50,165 --> 02:50:53,168
That one you're gonna have to explain
to me on the way home.

1786
02:50:54,753 --> 02:50:56,629
[Narrator] Suddenly there was a noise.

1787
02:50:56,754 --> 02:51:01,634
"Not so persuasive and powerful
as it had been on a rainy night in spring,"

1788
02:51:01,759 --> 02:51:07,765
but loud enough to work its way through
the final sighs of the timber that was rapidly burning out.

1789
02:51:08,891 --> 02:51:12,144
It came again.
Everyone heard it.

1790
02:51:12,269 --> 02:51:14,355
Grace was the first to recognize it.

1791
02:51:14,396 --> 02:51:15,773
"That's Moses,"

1792
02:51:16,106 --> 02:51:19,193
"That's Moses, she said,
and jumped out of the car."

1793
02:51:19,985 --> 02:51:27,034
"She quickly covered the distance to the dog pen
over what, now the buildings were gone,
could scarcely be
called a street,"

1794
02:51:27,075 --> 02:51:32,205
"and certainly not Elm Street as there wasn't
a tree left on Dogville's little mountain ledge,"

1795
02:51:32,289 --> 02:51:33,957
let alone an elm.

1796
02:51:34,291 --> 02:51:36,167
It was Moses.

1797
02:51:36,209 --> 02:51:39,629
His survival was astonishing.
A miracle.

1798
02:51:40,880 --> 02:51:44,133
"No, just let him be."

1799
02:51:44,801 --> 02:51:47,929
They will have spotted the flames
in Georgetown by now.

1800
02:51:48,804 --> 02:51:51,057
Some one'll come and find him.

1801
02:51:56,061 --> 02:51:59,565
He's just angry
because I once took his bone.

1802
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:16,623
"Whether Grace left Dogville or on the contrary,
Dogville had left her (and the world in general)"

1803
02:52:16,665 --> 02:52:21,961
is a question of a more artful nature
that few would benefit from by asking

1804
02:52:22,086 --> 02:52:24,922
and even fewer by providing an answer.

1805
02:52:25,006 --> 02:52:28,301
And nor indeed will it be answered here!
