1
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:46,168
<i>Here comes the President's helicopter,
Marine helicopter number one...</i>

2
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:50,212
<i>landing in the Plaza on the east
side of the east front of the Capitol.</i>

3
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:53,565
<i>Helicopter hovering
gently, just off the ground.</i>

4
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:57,923
<i>Amazing timing. The President flying
all the way across the world...</i>

5
00:00:58,013 --> 00:00:59,492
<i>across the Atlantic Ocean...</i>

6
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:03,771
<i>arriving almost exactly
as scheduled at 9:30...</i>

7
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,566
<i>in the Capitol Plaza...</i>

8
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:08,292
<i>so that he can go up the steps
of the House of Representatives...</i>

9
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:12,048
<i>go into the chamber, and address the
members of the House and the Senate...</i>

10
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,886
<i>the Supreme Court, the
diplomatic corps of Washington...</i>

11
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:17,009
<i>all of whom are inside
waiting for him...</i>

12
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,890
<i>in the chamber of the
House of Representatives.</i>

13
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,292
<i>Mr. Speaker...</i>

14
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:23,171
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

15
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:33,086
<i>And the President, accompanied
by the Escort Committee...</i>

16
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:36,529
<i>comes down the central aisle,
approaching the podium...</i>

17
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:39,206
<i>greets members of his Cabinet...</i>

18
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:42,410
<i>and those who are waiting to be
confirmed as members of his Cabinet...</i>

19
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:44,484
<i>as he reaches the rostrum.</i>

20
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:50,052
<i>Shakes hands with the
Speaker, Carl Albert...</i>

21
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,724
<i>A happy President, smiling.</i>

22
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:57,050
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, President
Nixon will, in a moment...</i>

23
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:00,603
<i>address the Congress and the
people of the United States.</i>

24
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:04,322
<i>Thank you.</i>

25
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,042
<i>Car 727. Car 727.</i>

26
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,283
<i>Open door at the
Watergate office building.</i>

27
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,807
<i>Possible burglary.
See the security guard.</i>

28
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:04,690
Are you sure you want us?

29
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,844
517 is closer and they're in uniform.

30
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:09,083
<i>They're getting gas. You take it.</i>

31
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:32,171
Unit 1 to Unit 2.

32
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:35,726
Unit 1 to Unit 2.

33
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:38,204
<i>- What?
- We're home.</i>

34
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:57,211
Base 1 to Unit 1.

35
00:04:58,293 --> 00:04:59,612
Base 1 to Unit 1.

36
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:02,205
<i>We have some activity here.</i>

37
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:04,372
<i>Silence is advised.</i>

38
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:08,962
Shut it off.

39
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:19,531
Base 1 to Unit 1.

40
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:22,204
Lights on the eighth floor.

41
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:24,611
Base 1 to Unit 1.

42
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:28,051
Is there anybody there?

43
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:36,611
There's people, people on
the balcony. Armed people.

44
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:40,731
Base 1 to Unit 1.

45
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:46,483
Base 1 to Unit 1. We
may have some problems.

46
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:53,372
Someone's here.

47
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,763
- Hold it, you...
- Police!

48
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:23,166
Put your hands up!

49
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:35,126
Drop that jacket!

50
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:41,042
Walkie-talkie, two 35mm cameras.

51
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,651
Got it. That's good.

52
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,606
All right, stay there.

53
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,284
I already got something
for you. Did you see this?

54
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:50,204
A couple sleeping in
bed, car hits the house...

55
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:52,204
goes through the bedroom,
comes out the other side.

56
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:53,567
Good morning. Crash.

57
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:55,644
Lewis is over at
Democratic headquarters.

58
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:58,042
One of the burglars had $814.

59
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:01,609
One $230, one $215, and one $234.

60
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:05,568
Most of it was in $100
bills and in sequence.

61
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:07,527
<i>- Woodward?
- Yeah?</i>

62
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:09,569
There's been a break-in at
the Democratic headquarters.

63
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:11,564
<i>- There's been an arrest.
- Local Democratic headquarters.</i>

64
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:12,688
<i>They were bugging the place.</i>

65
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:15,128
<i>Check the time of arraignment,
and get over there.</i>

66
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:17,886
<i>And, Woodward, it was National
Democratic headquarters.</i>

67
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:19,247
All right.

68
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:22,524
- Anything else?
- Anything else?

69
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:25,731
Break-in, car crash. That's
not bad for a Saturday.

70
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,531
Okay, let me know what
happens. Hello, Carl.

71
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,841
Got anything on that couple?

72
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,208
Harry, I know somebody on
the staff over at Watergate.

73
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:34,524
Bernstein, why don't you finish one
story before trying to get on another?

74
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:35,966
I finished it.

75
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,170
- The Virginia Legislature story?
- I finished it.

76
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:39,845
All right, give it to me.

77
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,687
I'm just polishing it.
I'll work the phones.

78
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:45,048
Polishing it? Yeah, you work the phones.

79
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:54,083
Excuse me, I'm sorry, who are the lawyers
for the five men arrested at Watergate?

80
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,208
Do you know?

81
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:57,602
- Well, these two were assigned to it.
- I'm sorry?

82
00:07:57,693 --> 00:07:59,923
These two were appointed to the case.

83
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:03,045
But only now it turns out the
burglars have their own counsel.

84
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,249
- The burglars have their own counsel?
- That's right.

85
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,289
That's kind of unusual,
wouldn't you say?

86
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:08,965
For burglars it's unusual.

87
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:12,602
- You know the name of the counsel? -
I don't know. Some country-club type.

88
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,568
<i>You are charged with
soliciting prostitution...</i>

89
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:17,530
<i>at 14th and east street.</i>

90
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:21,409
And you get as your
solicitor, one Perry Woodstock.

91
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:25,732
Your Honor, Mrs. Hawkin has in the past
been a reliable, hardworking parent.

92
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:29,931
<i>Parents are sworn over. I think
$300 would be acceptable...</i>

93
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:32,129
Excuse me, what is your name?

94
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,847
<i>I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.</i>

95
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:38,611
- Markham.
- Markham.

96
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:42,362
Mr. Markham, are you here in
connection with the Watergate burglary?

97
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,606
I'm not here.

98
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:48,808
Okay.

99
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:53,209
Well, clearly, I am here...

100
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:56,650
but only as an individual,
not as the attorney of record.

101
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:57,888
Who is?

102
00:08:58,653 --> 00:08:59,972
Mr. Starkey.

103
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,403
- Do you have any...
- Whatever you want...

104
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:06,769
you'll have to get it from
him. I have nothing more to say.

105
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:18,125
<i>Starkey.
S-T-...</i>

106
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,171
Mr. Starkey was very helpful.

107
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:27,484
Four Cuban Americans and
another man, James W. McCord.

108
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:31,251
Look, I told you inside,
I have nothing more to say.

109
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,925
I understand that.

110
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,326
What I don't understand
is how you got here.

111
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:39,965
I assure you there's nothing
very mysterious involved.

112
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,806
Well, a little while ago, I was
talking to a couple of the lawyers...

113
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:44,611
assigned to represent the burglars.

114
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:45,728
So?

115
00:09:45,813 --> 00:09:48,281
They never would have been assigned
to represent the burglars...

116
00:09:48,373 --> 00:09:51,171
had anyone known the burglars had
arranged for their own counsel.

117
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:53,721
Only, the burglars couldn't have
arranged for their own counsel...

118
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:56,122
since they never even made a phone call.

119
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:59,445
So, if no one asked you to
be here, why are you here?

120
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,124
<i>I don't want you to take
this personally, Mr...</i>

121
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:03,646
- Woodward.
- Woodward.

122
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:05,890
It'd be a mistake to do that.

123
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:08,649
I just don't have anything to say.

124
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,884
Did one of the other men
involved in the break-in call you?

125
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:27,211
What reason do you have to assume
that there were other people involved?

126
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,126
Well, one of your clients was
arrested with a walkie-talkie.

127
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,805
They're not my clients.

128
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:34,925
Now, I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

129
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:37,243
You're a lawyer and you're here.

130
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:42,448
One of the defendants, Mr. Barker,
and I met at a social occasion once.

131
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:45,570
- Where?
- I have nothing else to say.

132
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:46,688
A Miami social occasion?

133
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:49,287
Mr. Starkey says the
Cubans were from Miami.

134
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,964
L-62, James McCord.

135
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:53,771
L-63, Bernard Barker.

136
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,492
L-64, Virgil Gonzales.

137
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,643
L-65, Eugenio Martinez.

138
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:01,207
L-66, Frank Sturgis.

139
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:03,803
Please step forward, Attorney Starkey.

140
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:05,804
All charged with Burglary 2.

141
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,251
- Mr. Starkey, will you represent all five?
- Yes, Your Honor.

142
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,405
And are all five gentlemen charged
with burglary, second degree?

143
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:15,528
Yes, Your Honor.

144
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:18,127
Your names, please, and
state your professions.

145
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:21,251
Bernard Barker, anti-communist.

146
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:25,608
Anti-communist? That, sir, is
not your average profession.

147
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:31,131
James McCord, security consultant.

148
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:32,368
Where?

149
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:35,286
Government. Recently retired.

150
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:39,328
- Where in the government?
- Central Intelligence Agency.

151
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:40,888
Where?

152
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:42,362
The CIA.

153
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:45,971
Sturgis, Frank A., salvage operator.

154
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,807
Holy shit!

155
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:51,607
Eugenio Martinez, known as Gene Valdez.

156
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:53,888
James W. McCord, alias Edward Martin.

157
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:55,770
Frank Sturgis, alias Frank Fiorini.

158
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:57,650
All five of them had at least one alias.

159
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:00,645
Is there any proof they were trying to
bug the National Democratic Chairman?

160
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,405
It's obvious they were
trying to bug O'Brien.

161
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:04,404
They wouldn't go to all that
trouble to bug secretaries.

162
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:05,721
- There's no proof.
- Wait a minute.

163
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:07,007
I called a lawyer in Miami I know.

164
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,653
He said four of the guys who
were arrested were from Miami...

165
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:12,008
Gonzales, Martinez, Sturgis, and Barker.

166
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:15,688
<i>Yeah, Barker. And all four of them
were involved in CIA activities...</i>

167
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:17,286
- No, they weren't.
- Yeah.

168
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:20,445
No, only one of them was admitted
CIA, and the CIA won't confirm that.

169
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,364
In fact, they deny even knowing McCord.

170
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:25,570
Yeah, but I just think it's obvious
that with all that money and equipment...

171
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:29,168
they weren't out to work by
themselves. Somebody hired them.

172
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:30,971
I'm not interested in
what you think is obvious.

173
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:32,122
I'm interested in what you know.

174
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:34,852
What we don't know is why they
wanted to bug Democratic Headquarters.

175
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,412
Whether they were
working for themselves...

176
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:38,085
or other individuals
or other organizations.

177
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:40,050
Could be a story, or
could just be crazy Cubans.

178
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,169
Bachinski, when you get
there tonight, take it easy.

179
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:43,811
The police are nervous.

180
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:53,162
Yeah?

181
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:54,891
<i>Bachinski, calling from
Police Headquarters.</i>

182
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,282
<i>A friend just showed me what
they found in the hotel rooms...</i>

183
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:58,408
<i>of the Watergate burglars.</i>

184
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:00,449
<i>There's something here you
might want to look into.</i>

185
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:02,808
Hang on. Okay, go ahead.

186
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:05,851
<i>There's a strange entry in two
of the burglars'address books.</i>

187
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:09,209
<i>- Yeah.
- One says, "H.H. At W.H."</i>

188
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:12,726
<i>The other says,
"Howard Hunt, W. House".</i>

189
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:17,890
You can dial the White
House direct, can't you?

190
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:19,042
Yeah.

191
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,887
- What's the
number? - 456-1414.

192
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:35,648
<i>- White House.
- Howard Hunt, please.</i>

193
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:38,289
<i>Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.</i>

194
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:41,451
<i>He might be in Mr. Colson's
office. I'll connect you.</i>

195
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:43,367
Thank you.

196
00:13:44,093 --> 00:13:46,653
<i>- Charles Colson's office.
- Howard Hunt, please.</i>

197
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:49,884
<i>- Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.
- Do you know when he'll be back?</i>

198
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:51,088
<i>No, I don't.</i>

199
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,602
Okay, thank you.

200
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,161
<i>- Have you tried the Mullen Firm?
- I beg your pardon?</i>

201
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:58,051
<i>He also works as a writer at
Mullen & Company Public Relations.</i>

202
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:00,124
Do you have a phone on
that or an address, please?

203
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:01,771
<i>No, I don't. I'm sorry.</i>

204
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,327
All right, thank you.

205
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:08,162
Harry?

206
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:10,406
Who's Charles Colson?

207
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:13,611
Who's Charles Colson?

208
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:15,202
Sit down.

209
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,244
You know, I'm glad you
asked me that question.

210
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,244
The reason I'm glad you
asked me is because...

211
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,608
if you had asked Simons or
Bradlee, they would've said:

212
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:26,402
"You know we're going to have to fire
this schmuck at once because he's so dumb!"

213
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:28,290
Who is Charles Colson?

214
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:32,125
The most powerful man in the
United States is President Nixon.

215
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:33,566
You've heard of him?

216
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:38,406
Charles Colson is Special
Counsel to the President.

217
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:40,644
There's a cartoon on his wall.

218
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:44,450
Caption reads, "When you've
got them by the balls...

219
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:47,127
"their hearts and minds will follow".

220
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,008
<i>Mullen & Company.</i>

221
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:57,482
<i>- Howard Hunt, please.
- One moment, please.</i>

222
00:14:58,373 --> 00:14:59,806
<i>Howard Hunt here.</i>

223
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:03,573
<i>Hi, I'm Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

224
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,166
<i>Yes, what is it?</i>

225
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:08,121
I was just kind of wondering
why your name and phone number...

226
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:11,922
were in the address books of two
of the men arrested at Watergate?

227
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:13,048
<i>Good God!</i>

228
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,248
Do you care to comment?

229
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,848
<i>In view that the matter is under
adjudication, I have no comment.</i>

230
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:21,082
<i>Hello?</i>

231
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:23,164
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

232
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:26,211
I was told that you had
worked with a Mr. Howard Hunt.

233
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,489
<i>Why would anyone say that?</i>

234
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:30,205
You do know Mr. Hunt?

235
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:33,808
<i>No, I don't believe so, and I can't
imagine why anyone would say that.</i>

236
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:36,771
<i>Listen, I'm really sorry, but
I was on my way out. Goodbye.</i>

237
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,765
<i>Could we just confirm a couple... Bye.</i>

238
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:46,089
<i>- Did you say the Washington Post?
- Yes, that's right, the Post.</i>

239
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:50,166
Your publishing firm was listed in some
papers in connection with a Howard Hunt.

240
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,323
<i>Yeah, he's one of our authors.</i>

241
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:54,370
<i>He wrote spy novels, I think.</i>

242
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,163
What type of spy novels were they?
Were they modern, or were they period...

243
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:00,721
You say, "wrote"? You mean
he's no longer with you anymore?

244
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:01,962
<i>No, not at this time.</i>

245
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:04,283
How long has it been since
you've heard from him?

246
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:05,601
<i>A couple of years, I think.</i>

247
00:16:05,693 --> 00:16:08,605
Could you tell me some of the names
of the novels that he has written?

248
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:13,411
<i>- Hello? Is this Mr. Paul Herrera?
- ¿Quién?</i>

249
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:16,201
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

250
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:19,732
<i>Bob Woodward of the...
Do you speak English?</i>

251
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,922
<i>Momento, momento.</i>

252
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:26,688
Do any of you guys speak English?
Do any of you guys speak Spanish?

253
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:31,806
<i>- Señor.
- Sí.</i>

254
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,404
Never mind. Thank you.

255
00:16:39,813 --> 00:16:41,132
Thank you. Never mind.

256
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,091
<i>- Hello.
- Mr. Bennett?</i>

257
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:50,526
<i>- Yes.
- This is Bob Woodward...</i>

258
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:51,648
<i>of the Washington Post.</i>

259
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:52,768
Sorry to bother you at home.

260
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:54,764
I was wondering if you could
confirm some information...

261
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:56,809
on one of your employees,
Mr. Howard Hunt?

262
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:58,042
<i>What kind of information?</i>

263
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:59,646
It's just profile information mostly.

264
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:02,042
We know, for example, that he
works for Mullen & Company...

265
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:05,887
or did work for Mullen & Company
as a writer. He's also a novelist.

266
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:09,090
We know that he works in the office of
Mr. Charles Colson at the White House.

267
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:10,288
<i>And the CIA.</i>

268
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:12,606
And the CIA.

269
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,966
<i>If you're conducting that
kind of investigation...</i>

270
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:19,972
<i>then certainly it comes as no surprise
to you that Howard was with the CIA.</i>

271
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:22,044
No, no surprise at all.

272
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,523
Hunt worked for the CIA till 1970.

273
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,924
From '49 to '70. Now, this
is on deep background...

274
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:31,368
but the FBI thinks he's
involved with the break-in.

275
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:32,522
What else you got?

276
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:34,046
According to White House personnel...

277
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,283
Hunt definitely worked there
as a consultant for Colson.

278
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:39,729
That's Charles Colson, the
President's Special Counsel.

279
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,371
Did you call the White
House Press Office?

280
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:42,772
I went over there. I talked to them.

281
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,287
They said Hunt hadn't worked
there for three months.

282
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,933
Then a PR guy said
this weird thing to me.

283
00:17:49,573 --> 00:17:51,882
He said, "I'm convinced
that neither Mr. Colson...

284
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:53,372
"nor anyone at the White House...

285
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:55,728
"had any knowledge of
or participation in...

286
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:59,328
"this deplorable incident at the
Democratic National Committee".

287
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:03,050
- Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
- Absolutely.

288
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:04,928
So?

289
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:07,250
I never asked about Watergate.

290
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:11,045
I simply asked what were Hunt's
duties at the White House.

291
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:14,809
They volunteered he was innocent
when nobody asked if he was guilty.

292
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:18,804
Be careful how you write it.

293
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,453
Looks like we've got a White House
consultant linked to the bugging.

294
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,808
Harry, this isn't a police
story anymore. This is national.

295
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:27,531
We need a top political writer on it.

296
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:29,205
Well, they don't want it.

297
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:31,523
They're all over the goddamned
map covering the Primaries.

298
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,331
Besides, this guy has busted his ass.

299
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,563
He's been on this paper
for only nine months.

300
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:37,769
- What's the matter with you?
- He's a humper!

301
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:40,043
What's he been writing about,
rat shit in restaurants?

302
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,522
- He's got no experience.
- He got a few of them closed, didn't he?

303
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:44,171
Minor incidents. Small
government agencies.

304
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:47,404
Have Mr. Moffitt come in here,
please. And see if Mr. Bradlee's free.

305
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,642
I want Ben to hear this.

306
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,644
Sure Moffitt'll want the
story for the National desk...

307
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,166
now that we've built it into something.

308
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:53,652
Even Bernstein's busting his ass!

309
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,770
I read that cockamamie memorandum
he wrote on the break-in.

310
00:18:56,853 --> 00:18:59,083
All right, so some of it was bullshit.

311
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:00,686
What is the matter with you?

312
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,651
You told me yourself you were
going to fire him last month.

313
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:07,842
Look, he wants on the
story bad. They both do!

314
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,645
He knows a lot of people.

315
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:13,411
Howard, they're hungry!

316
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:15,085
You remember when you were hungry?

317
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,285
<i>Hello. Can you get me Nigel...</i>

318
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:39,732
Right away.

319
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,725
- How's it going?
- What are you doing?

320
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:56,166
- Polishing it a little.
- What?

321
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:57,891
- Polishing it.
- What's wrong with it?

322
00:20:57,973 --> 00:20:59,565
Nothing. Nothing. It's good.

323
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:00,847
Then what are you doing with it?

324
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:03,493
I'm just helping. It's a little fuzzy.

325
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:04,922
May I have it?

326
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,571
I don't think you're
saying what you mean.

327
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:08,006
I know exactly what I mean.

328
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:09,685
Not here, I can't tell
from this whether...

329
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:11,491
Hunt works for Colson
or Colson works for Hunt.

330
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:13,404
- May I have it, please?
- Some of the conclusions...

331
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:15,324
- May I have it?
- Yes. I'm not looking for a fight.

332
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:16,687
I'm not looking for a fight, either.

333
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:19,924
I'm just aware of the fact that
you've only been here nine months.

334
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:21,527
What's that got to do with anything?

335
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,966
I've been in the business since I'm 16.

336
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:24,088
What are you saying?

337
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:26,812
<i>I'm trying to tell you that if you'd
read mine and then read yours...</i>

338
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:28,485
- May I read yours?
- Yeah.

339
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:31,363
I walked by, gave yours a
glance, it didn't look right...

340
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:32,966
so I just figured I'd
refine it a little.

341
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:34,850
The first paragraph has
to have more clarity...

342
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,332
if the reader's going to understand it.

343
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:39,211
You don't mention Colson's
name till the third paragraph.

344
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:41,204
I think mine's better. But
you go ahead and read it.

345
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:43,363
If you think yours is better,
we'll give yours to the desk.

346
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:45,409
I've got Colson's name up front.

347
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:48,564
He's a White House consultant
and nobody knows it.

348
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:50,052
You're right.

349
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:52,206
Yours is better.

350
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,444
If you're going to do it, do
it right. Here are my notes.

351
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,489
If you're going to hype
it, hype it with the facts.

352
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:10,451
I don't mind what you did.
I mind the way you did it.

353
00:22:11,853 --> 00:22:13,445
Woodward. Bernstein.

354
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,842
You're both on the story.
Now don't fuck it up.

355
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:25,210
Steuben, what's the name of that
girl that you bombed out with...

356
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:27,682
- that works in Colson's office?
- Sharon Lyle.

357
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:32,843
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- You're attractive.

358
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,045
You are very attractive.

359
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:38,927
You know, my girlfriend
told me to watch out for you.

360
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:41,129
- Who?
- I'm not giving any names.

361
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:44,523
Steuben said you worked for Colson.

362
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,808
Steuben's crazy. I
never worked for Colson.

363
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:51,121
That's what he said.

364
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:55,092
I worked for an assistant. Colson
was really big on secrets, anyway.

365
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:59,043
Even if I had worked for
him, I wouldn't know anything!

366
00:23:00,773 --> 00:23:04,288
Did you know Howard Hunt?
Didn't he work in the office?

367
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:05,601
Yeah, I knew Howard.

368
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:07,888
- Nice?
- He's a nice person.

369
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:11,245
He's secretive, he is
secretive, but a decent man.

370
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:14,093
Do you have any idea what he did?

371
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:18,570
The White House said he was
doing some investigative work.

372
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:19,881
What do you say?

373
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:24,167
- He was doing investigative work.
- On what?

374
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,490
- Different things.
- Like what?

375
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:31,522
She warned me.

376
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:34,173
I'm not going to take my
book out. I'm just asking you.

377
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,683
The scuttlebutt for a while was
that he was investigating Kennedy.

378
00:23:38,773 --> 00:23:39,842
Go on.

379
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:42,846
The White House was real
paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.

380
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:47,690
I remember seeing a book about
Chappaquiddick on his desk.

381
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:50,571
And he was always getting material
out of the White House Library...

382
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:53,645
and the Library of Congress,
and anything he could find.

383
00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:57,452
<i>White House Library.</i>

384
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,728
<i>Hi, this is Carl Bernstein
of the Washington Post...</i>

385
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,849
and I was just wondering
if you can remember...

386
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:05,721
any books that a Howard Hunt
checked out on Senator Kennedy?

387
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:07,451
<i>- Howard Hunt?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

388
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:11,446
<i>Yes, I think I do remember.</i>

389
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:13,968
<i>He took out a whole lot of material.</i>

390
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:17,808
<i>- Why don't you hold on and I'll see?
- I sure will. Thank you very much.</i>

391
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:32,171
<i>- Mr. Bernstein?
- Yes, ma'am?</i>

392
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,764
<i>- I was wrong.
- I beg your pardon?</i>

393
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:39,210
<i>The truth is, I don't have a card
that says Mr. Hunt took any material.</i>

394
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:42,569
<i>I don't remember getting material for...</i>

395
00:24:42,653 --> 00:24:45,565
<i>I do remember getting material for
somebody, but it wasn't for Mr. Hunt.</i>

396
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:46,881
All right.

397
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:51,248
<i>The truth is, I didn't have any
requests at all from Mr. Hunt.</i>

398
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:57,372
<i>The truth is, I don't know any Mr. Hunt.</i>

399
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:06,086
<i>I was just wondering if
you have any books... Hello?</i>

400
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,653
Yes, we're checking
that information now.

401
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:15,531
We'd just like to find out just
what it was that Hunt did...

402
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:18,923
when he worked out as a White House
consultant on the Pentagon Papers.

403
00:25:19,013 --> 00:25:20,605
Yes, I'd appreciate that, if you could.

404
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,604
Yes, sir. Thank you.

405
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:24,649
I just got off the phone with
the White House librarian.

406
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,883
You want to look at the notes on it?

407
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:32,002
This is some stuff from the
Eisenhower campaign in 1952...

408
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:34,243
that Hunt was connected with.

409
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,324
Did you call the White
House Communications Office?

410
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,688
No, I just got off the
phone with the librarian.

411
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:43,924
- 524-743. - I
know the number.

412
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:48,846
Between the first and second quote
there's a complete contradiction.

413
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:50,412
It's a space of about five seconds.

414
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:51,642
<i>- My feeling is...
- Was this all...</i>

415
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:52,802
<i>Mr. Clawson's office.</i>

416
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:54,565
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

417
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,087
<i>- Could I talk to Mr. Clawson, please?
- One moment, please.</i>

418
00:25:57,173 --> 00:25:58,401
Thank you.

419
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:00,804
When she came back she
said she didn't even know...

420
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,248
<i>- Ken Clawson.
- Mr. Clawson, this is Bob Woodward.</i>

421
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,767
<i>Carl Bernstein of the Washington
Post had a conversation...</i>

422
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:07,286
with a White House librarian...

423
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:10,683
on some books a Mr. Howard Hunt
took out on Senator Edward Kennedy.

424
00:26:10,773 --> 00:26:14,049
She first said that Howard Hunt had
taken out books on Senator Kennedy...

425
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:16,283
and then she denied
even knowing who he was.

426
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:19,092
I was wondering if you'd like
to comment on this confusion.

427
00:26:19,173 --> 00:26:21,323
<i>Listen, let me call
you back on this matter.</i>

428
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,166
<i>- I'm going to check on it for you.
- All right, thank you. Bye.</i>

429
00:26:24,253 --> 00:26:25,481
- Call back?
- Yes.

430
00:26:25,573 --> 00:26:27,529
- This was all one conversation?
- Yeah.

431
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:30,491
She says first of all, "I think
I got a bunch of books on Hunt".

432
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:33,531
She comes back five seconds later, she says,
"I don't even know a Mr. Hunt".

433
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:34,728
It's obvious someone got to her.

434
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:37,168
Not enough proof. I mean, if
there was just a piece of paper...

435
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:40,211
that said that Hunt was taking out
books on Kennedy and Chappaquiddick.

436
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:41,931
<i>Like a... I don't know, library slip.</i>

437
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:43,924
Hunt also took out books from
the Library of Congress...

438
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:47,050
but what's more important is that
somebody got to her in that space of time.

439
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:49,601
<i>- How do you know somebody got to her?
- Because she said that Hunt...</i>

440
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,445
There was a lot of books
that Hunt checked out.

441
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:53,444
And then she comes back
and she don't even know him.

442
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:56,331
<i>- Woodward.
- Mr. Woodward, Ken Clawson calling back.</i>

443
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:59,166
<i>- I've just talked with the librarian.
- Yes, sir.</i>

444
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:03,326
<i>She denies that the conversation
with Mr. Bernstein ever took place.</i>

445
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,688
<i>She said she referred
him to the Press Office.</i>

446
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:07,729
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you
say she denies even knowing...

447
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:09,451
about the conversation taking place?

448
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:14,209
<i>That's right. She said someone did
call her asking about Mr. Hunt...</i>

449
00:27:14,293 --> 00:27:16,966
<i>but all she did was refer
him to the Press Office...</i>

450
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,202
<i>and she denies that...</i>

451
00:27:18,293 --> 00:27:20,568
<i>- any other conversation took place.
- Total bullshit.</i>

452
00:27:20,653 --> 00:27:23,725
<i>- I hope that's been of some help to you.
- Thank you.</i>

453
00:27:27,293 --> 00:27:30,603
- We've got to get something on paper.
- The Library of Congress.

454
00:27:32,493 --> 00:27:33,528
Mona?

455
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:36,322
Excuse me, Mona, could you
take any calls for me, please?

456
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:38,005
- Sure.
- Here's my note.

457
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:40,651
<i>If I get any calls...</i>

458
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,161
- Will you be back later?
- I don't know when.

459
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,130
You want all the material
requested by the White House?

460
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:04,292
All White House transactions
are confidential.

461
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:07,284
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

462
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:16,443
- We need a sympathetic face.
- We're not going to find one here.

463
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:18,804
You want every request since when?

464
00:28:19,373 --> 00:28:21,364
- When did he start?
- July of '71.

465
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:23,364
I imagine the whole last year.

466
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:28,172
I'm not sure you want
them, but I've got them.

467
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,170
Maybe they pulled the cards.

468
00:29:23,253 --> 00:29:24,572
Maybe they changed the names.

469
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:27,565
There might have been a
card there, and we missed it.

470
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:29,286
Hey, wait a minute.

471
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:33,126
I met a White House aide
once at a social occasion.

472
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:35,488
- So?
- He might confirm.

473
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:40,173
- Do we need W.H. In White House?
- Not in the second paragraph.

474
00:29:40,253 --> 00:29:42,244
- I don't think we do. Do we?
- White House will be enough.

475
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,244
- White House.
- Just use White House. Forget the W.H.

476
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,722
I want to know about Colson. What
was his job at the White House?

477
00:29:46,813 --> 00:29:49,691
- Special consultant to the President.
- I gotta say it.

478
00:29:51,213 --> 00:29:54,489
These notes on the White House
librarian, are they accurate?

479
00:29:55,853 --> 00:29:57,923
The White House librarian,
the notes, are they accurate?

480
00:29:58,013 --> 00:29:59,731
Yeah, but I wanna hear him say it.

481
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:22,572
- Okay, let's have it.
- Here you are, Ben.

482
00:30:22,893 --> 00:30:25,361
It's a good, solid piece
of American journalism...

483
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:27,921
<i>that the New York Times doesn't have.</i>

484
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,048
You haven't got it.

485
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,249
A librarian and a secretary
saying Hunt looked at a book.

486
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,368
That's not good enough.

487
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:58,570
A White House aide told me that
Hunt was investigating Kennedy.

488
00:30:58,653 --> 00:30:59,768
Who was it?

489
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:02,409
Who was it? You want the name, you mean?

490
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,324
No, how senior, how high up?

491
00:31:04,653 --> 00:31:06,132
I don't know titles.

492
00:31:19,653 --> 00:31:20,847
"Showed a special interest".

493
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:23,163
No, we said the White House
was investigating Kennedy.

494
00:31:23,253 --> 00:31:24,891
"Showed a special interest in him".

495
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:26,372
Jesus, the story's stronger than that.

496
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:28,808
The White House librarian says
Hunt checked out a lot of books.

497
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:31,487
<i>We got a secretary in Colson's
office said Hunt was sitting...</i>

498
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:34,645
All right, Carl. Ben,
that's a Page 1 story.

499
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:38,243
Stick it inside someplace.

500
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:41,728
This is a goddamn important story.

501
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:49,288
Get some harder information next time.

502
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:56,931
Asshole. Bradlee's just
sticking up for the Kennedys.

503
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:58,924
- We didn't have it, that's all.
- Bullshit. We had it cold.

504
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:00,890
- No, we didn't.
- Why didn't you say something?

505
00:32:00,973 --> 00:32:04,409
Do you think bitching about it is
going to get the story where we want it?

506
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,205
Throw it in the can.

507
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:38,885
<i>- Yes?
- This is Woodward.</i>

508
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,687
I want to talk about
Watergate. I know...

509
00:32:43,773 --> 00:32:46,241
<i>We're not going to
talk about that subject.</i>

510
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:50,931
<i>- We talked about Wallace.
- But this is different.</i>

511
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:55,050
That was about the shooting
of a man running for President.

512
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,684
<i>- This is different.
- How?</i>

513
00:32:58,653 --> 00:33:01,406
<i>Not about this story.
Don't call me again.</i>

514
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:25,604
Good luck, Mr. President.

515
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,002
Taxi.

516
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:27,684
- Where are you?
- Stuck.

517
00:36:28,613 --> 00:36:30,569
The story's stalled on us.

518
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:35,209
And you thought I'd help?

519
00:36:38,093 --> 00:36:39,845
I'll never quote you.

520
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:44,372
<i>I wouldn't quote you even
as an anonymous source:</i>

521
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,523
You'd be on deep background.

522
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:51,923
You can trust me. You know that.

523
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:56,008
Go on.

524
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:02,085
- Can you tell me what you know?
- You tell me what you know.

525
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:09,452
Hunt worked for Colson
at the White House.

526
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:13,331
Hunt was investigating
Kennedy at Chappaquiddick.

527
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:15,449
That should tell you a lot.

528
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,807
What else?

529
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:22,092
We're beginning to hear a lot about
a lawyer at CREEP named Gordon Liddy...

530
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,001
<i>who's...</i>

531
00:37:36,693 --> 00:37:38,172
Gordon Liddy...

532
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:42,083
was fired by Mitchell because
he wouldn't talk to the FBI.

533
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:45,401
- You'll hear more.
- Will he talk?

534
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:52,763
I was at a party once, and...

535
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:56,448
Liddy put his hand over a
candle, and he kept it there.

536
00:37:57,293 --> 00:38:00,763
He kept it right in the flame
until his flesh was burned.

537
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:06,691
Somebody said, "What's the trick?"
And Liddy said, "The trick is not minding".

538
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:12,251
The story is dry.

539
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:16,248
All we've got are pieces.

540
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:19,928
We can't seem to figure out what
the puzzle is supposed to look like.

541
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:22,447
John Mitchell resigns
as the head of CREEP...

542
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,252
and says that he wants to
spend more time with his family.

543
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:28,086
Sounds like bullshit. We
don't exactly believe that.

544
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,970
No, but it's touching.

545
00:38:33,013 --> 00:38:36,608
Forget the myths the media's
created about the White House.

546
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:40,286
The truth is, these are
not very bright guys...

547
00:38:40,373 --> 00:38:42,364
and things got out of hand.

548
00:38:43,693 --> 00:38:45,809
Hunt's come in from the cold.

549
00:38:46,373 --> 00:38:50,730
Supposedly, he's got a lawyer
with $25,000 in a brown paper bag.

550
00:38:50,813 --> 00:38:52,371
Follow the money.

551
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:57,770
What do you mean? Where?

552
00:38:57,853 --> 00:38:59,605
I can't tell you that.

553
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:02,049
But you could tell me that.

554
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,723
No, I have to do this my way.

555
00:39:05,013 --> 00:39:08,005
You tell me what you
know and I'll confirm.

556
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:12,248
I'll keep you in the right
direction if I can, but that's all.

557
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:17,524
Just follow the money.

558
00:39:28,053 --> 00:39:30,726
<i>- Goddamn New York Times.
- What is it?</i>

559
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:35,962
Phone calls from burglars in
Miami to the Committee to Re-Elect.

560
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:40,732
Fifteen phone calls.

561
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:44,567
At least 15 phone calls and those phone
calls were made as early as March 15...

562
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:46,530
which is a full three
months before the break-in.

563
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:49,810
"$89,000 issued in the name
of a prominent Mexican lawyer".

564
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:52,282
$89,000 in Mexican checks?

565
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:54,924
Why didn't we get this?

566
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:56,927
Who are their sources?

567
00:39:57,013 --> 00:40:00,130
I even know someone who
works at the phone company.

568
00:40:00,453 --> 00:40:02,842
Carl, if John Mitchell
wanted your phone records...

569
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,163
you'd be running around
yelling invasion of privacy.

570
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:06,732
<i>Was the New York Times article accurate?</i>

571
00:40:06,813 --> 00:40:09,452
- Yeah, but I can't get you a fuller listing.
- Why?

572
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:11,808
They've subpoenaed all of
Bernard Barker's phone records.

573
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:16,284
I think they're trying to find out if the
Watergate burglars broke any Florida law.

574
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,483
- Who subpoenaed them?
- Miami DA.

575
00:40:19,573 --> 00:40:21,404
- What's his name?
- I don't know his name.

576
00:40:21,493 --> 00:40:24,326
But, the guy who's heading the
investigation is named Dardis.

577
00:40:24,413 --> 00:40:26,324
Dardis. What's his first name?

578
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:30,522
I don't know his first name. I
guess you'll have to find that out.

579
00:40:37,373 --> 00:40:40,445
Hi. I'm Carl Bernstein, I have a
9:15 appointment with Mr. Dardis.

580
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:42,808
Yes, Mr. Bernstein, I'm
afraid that Mr. Dardis...

581
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:44,292
won't be able to see you this morning.

582
00:40:44,373 --> 00:40:45,692
His calendar is really quite full.

583
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:48,287
There must be a mistake. I made
the appointment with him personally.

584
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:50,841
- I called from Washington.
- It should've been made through me.

585
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:53,208
If you care to wait, I'll see
if I can squeeze you in later.

586
00:40:53,293 --> 00:40:55,011
Oh, thanks very much.

587
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:59,928
I guess it's difficult when
he makes his own appointments.

588
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:02,523
Yes, well, we try to handle it.

589
00:41:10,773 --> 00:41:14,209
It's 4:00, we'll be back in
15 minutes. You want anything?

590
00:41:14,293 --> 00:41:16,124
- Coffee, black.
- Coffee, black.

591
00:41:21,493 --> 00:41:22,972
I'm still here.

592
00:41:23,373 --> 00:41:24,442
I'm so glad.

593
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:27,491
If you could just get me in to see him
for five minutes, I'd appreciate it.

594
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:30,212
- No, Mr. Bernstein.
- I have to get back.

595
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:32,045
We're going to try.

596
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,684
Oh, hi. He's expecting you.

597
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:46,604
I do have a couple of things to do. I'll
be at the Sheraton if you want to reach me.

598
00:41:46,693 --> 00:41:49,730
If he has any space tomorrow, I'd
appreciate it. Number's on the back.

599
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,930
- Fine.
- Thank you for your patience.

600
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:55,164
Thank you, Mr. Bernstein.
Tomorrow it should be better.

601
00:41:55,253 --> 00:41:56,572
I guess so.

602
00:42:00,773 --> 00:42:02,126
<i>Mr. Dardis' office.</i>

603
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:05,762
Hi. Please tell Mr. Dardis that
Mr. Bernstein has just left.

604
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:07,923
He'll be available all day tomorrow.

605
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:10,811
I think we can probably
squeeze him in around 4:30.

606
00:42:10,893 --> 00:42:11,962
<i>Yes.</i>

607
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:15,966
And please tell Mr. Dardis that he doesn't
want to be late for his 6:30 appointment.

608
00:42:16,053 --> 00:42:17,725
<i>- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.</i>

609
00:42:25,453 --> 00:42:26,522
Mr. Dardis' office.

610
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:28,922
<i>- This is Mr. Martinson over at the County...
- I beg your pardon?</i>

611
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,605
<i>Martinson, over at the
County Clerk's office.</i>

612
00:42:30,693 --> 00:42:32,604
<i>There's some records here
that Dardis wanted right away.</i>

613
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:34,684
<i>Could you come and get
them? We're closing.</i>

614
00:42:34,773 --> 00:42:36,604
Well, yes, I'll be right over.

615
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:03,925
Could be easier, too.
All right. Hold it.

616
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:05,969
- What?
- Excuse me.

617
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,532
Hi. Can I help you in some way?

618
00:43:07,613 --> 00:43:09,410
I'm Carl Bernstein. I've
been waiting since 9:00.

619
00:43:09,493 --> 00:43:11,688
- Would you wait outside?
- I've been waiting out since morning.

620
00:43:11,773 --> 00:43:14,082
- Go ahead. Finish your call.
- Wait outside, please, will you?

621
00:43:14,173 --> 00:43:16,562
<i>No. I'm the reporter
from the Washington Post.</i>

622
00:43:16,653 --> 00:43:18,245
We talked on the telephone yesterday...

623
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,244
and you told me to come
on down here and I'm here.

624
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:23,211
Okay, yeah. I've got the press here.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

625
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:25,249
If you didn't want to see me
I don't know why the hell...

626
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,891
you didn't tell me when
I was in Washington?

627
00:43:26,973 --> 00:43:29,726
I just wasted a whole goddamned day
here. My paper's waiting for a story.

628
00:43:29,813 --> 00:43:32,452
You tell me yesterday to come here.
You said I got a 9:30 appointment.

629
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:35,684
- I've been waiting out here the whole day.
- Caught me on the worst day possible.

630
00:43:35,773 --> 00:43:37,889
The man I work for has just
started a re-election campaign.

631
00:43:37,973 --> 00:43:40,282
Now, we're gonna have to see
each other tomorrow. Okay?

632
00:43:40,373 --> 00:43:43,012
No, sir, I'm facing a deadline and
my paper's saving a space for me.

633
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:45,926
<i>- I just don't have a minute now.
- Well, I'm sorry...</i>

634
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:49,212
Mr. Dardis, I'm really very
sorry about this. Mr. Bernstein...

635
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,170
I beg your pardon, ma'am,
but this gentleman...

636
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,845
made the appointment
with me specifically.

637
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:55,128
<i>And I think the Washington Post
deserves the same courtesy...</i>

638
00:43:55,213 --> 00:43:57,408
as any of the people waiting
out there, with all due respect.

639
00:43:57,493 --> 00:43:59,643
I'll buzz you in about five minutes.

640
00:44:01,413 --> 00:44:03,324
The lady takes good care of me.

641
00:44:04,453 --> 00:44:07,013
The fact is we just can't
go into it this evening.

642
00:44:07,093 --> 00:44:08,845
It's going to have to
wait till tomorrow. Okay?

643
00:44:08,933 --> 00:44:10,844
I just wish you could've
told me that before I left...

644
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:13,242
because I gotta go back to my
paper now and write that story...

645
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:15,210
one way or another, that's all.

646
00:44:18,293 --> 00:44:21,888
Do you want to see Mr. Barker's
phone records and his money records?

647
00:44:21,973 --> 00:44:25,249
You told me on the phone if I'd come here
you'd show everything you got on Barker.

648
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,801
- That's all I want.
- Well, that's what I've got.

649
00:44:27,893 --> 00:44:29,042
Well, that's fine.

650
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,249
Okay, you and I are going to
have to have an agreement...

651
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:34,689
that you're not going to reveal
the source of your information.

652
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:39,130
All these are cashier's checks
on a bank in Mexico City.

653
00:44:39,213 --> 00:44:40,931
<i>- All these checks from Mexico?
- Sí.</i>

654
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:43,004
How come? Did the money originate there?

655
00:44:43,093 --> 00:44:45,482
Well, I doubt it started off as pesos.

656
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:48,445
Wait a minute, what's this one?

657
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,683
<i>What's... Okay, $25,000.</i>

658
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:52,843
- Who's that?
- Kenneth H. Dahlberg.

659
00:44:52,933 --> 00:44:55,049
We haven't been able to
ascertain who that is.

660
00:44:55,453 --> 00:44:57,444
Bob, listen, I think I got
something. I don't know what it is.

661
00:44:57,533 --> 00:44:59,649
But somewhere in this world
there's a Kenneth H. Dahlberg.

662
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:01,883
<i>And we've got to get to him
before the New York Times does.</i>

663
00:45:01,973 --> 00:45:03,691
Because I think they
have the same information.

664
00:45:03,773 --> 00:45:05,206
Got a pencil? Write this down. Quick.

665
00:45:05,293 --> 00:45:08,729
Kenneth H. Dahlberg.
D-A-H-L-B-E-R-G.

666
00:45:10,093 --> 00:45:13,085
<i>McGovern, who at first had voiced
complete support for Eagleton...</i>

667
00:45:13,173 --> 00:45:15,050
<i>has more recently expressed doubts...</i>

668
00:45:15,133 --> 00:45:17,363
<i>and said that Eagleton
must make a decision...</i>

669
00:45:17,453 --> 00:45:19,728
<i>whether to stay or leave the ticket.</i>

670
00:45:20,933 --> 00:45:22,651
You're the one that
wanted the articles...

671
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:24,291
- on Dahlberg, Kenneth H. Dahlberg?
- Yeah.

672
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:26,204
Couldn't find anything
in the clip file at all.

673
00:45:26,293 --> 00:45:27,726
Oh, wonderful.

674
00:45:28,613 --> 00:45:31,571
I did find one picture
though, if it's any help.

675
00:45:33,893 --> 00:45:35,008
Thanks.

676
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:42,052
Minnesota.

677
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,772
<i>Minneapolis...</i>

678
00:46:04,373 --> 00:46:08,924
<i>I base that conclusion upon my
conversations with his doctors...</i>

679
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:12,970
<i>and my close personal and
political association...</i>

680
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:15,165
<i>- Outside line, please.
- Yes.</i>

681
00:46:15,453 --> 00:46:16,932
<i>- Thank you.
...the joint decision...</i>

682
00:46:17,013 --> 00:46:21,165
<i>that we have reached tonight,
health would not affect.</i>

683
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:23,524
<i>But the public debate...</i>

684
00:46:23,893 --> 00:46:26,851
<i>over Senator Eagleton's
past medical history...</i>

685
00:46:27,373 --> 00:46:31,161
<i>continues to divert attention
from the great national issues...</i>

686
00:46:31,253 --> 00:46:33,244
<i>that need to be discussed.</i>

687
00:46:34,013 --> 00:46:37,562
<i>I have referred to the
growing pressures that ask...</i>

688
00:46:37,653 --> 00:46:39,962
<i>for Senator Eagleton's withdrawal.</i>

689
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:42,408
<i>Hello?</i>

690
00:46:42,853 --> 00:46:44,923
<i>- Could I please... Mr. Dahlberg?
- Yes.</i>

691
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:47,049
<i>- Kenneth Dahlberg?
- Yes.</i>

692
00:46:47,813 --> 00:46:50,611
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

693
00:46:51,813 --> 00:46:54,202
<i>- Yes?
- About that $25,000 check...</i>

694
00:46:54,293 --> 00:46:56,932
deposited in the bank account of
one of the Watergate burglars...

695
00:46:57,013 --> 00:46:58,810
<i>Mr. Bernard Barker...</i>

696
00:47:01,093 --> 00:47:04,085
As you know, sir, the
check has your name on it.

697
00:47:04,693 --> 00:47:06,251
We were doing a story on this...

698
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:09,609
and I was wondering if you
would care to comment or explain?

699
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:12,652
<i>I turn all my money
over to the Committee.</i>

700
00:47:13,093 --> 00:47:15,766
What committee is that, sir?
The Committee to Re-Elect?

701
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:18,128
<i>- Yes.
- Why would you do that?</i>

702
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:23,804
<i>I raise a lot of money. I'm
Midwest Finance Chairman.</i>

703
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:26,523
For the Committee to Re-Elect?

704
00:47:27,013 --> 00:47:29,004
<i>- Hello?
- Yes, that's right.</i>

705
00:47:29,573 --> 00:47:33,407
How do you think your check got into the
bank account of the Watergate burglar?

706
00:47:33,493 --> 00:47:37,691
<i>I'm a proper citizen.
What I do is proper.</i>

707
00:47:38,413 --> 00:47:39,732
Oh, I understand.

708
00:47:39,813 --> 00:47:42,407
<i>I've just been through
a terrible ordeal.</i>

709
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:44,768
<i>My neighbor's wife has been kidnapped.</i>

710
00:47:45,413 --> 00:47:48,962
How do you think your check
got into Barker's account list?

711
00:48:21,413 --> 00:48:24,450
<i>- Committee to Re-Elect the President.
- Could I speak to Mr. Clark MacGregor?</i>

712
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:26,922
<i>- One moment, I'll connect you.
- Thank you.</i>

713
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:29,202
<i>Yes?</i>

714
00:48:29,293 --> 00:48:30,442
<i>- Mr. MacGregor?
- Yes.</i>

715
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:33,286
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

716
00:48:33,933 --> 00:48:35,366
<i>- Hello?
- Yes.</i>

717
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:37,808
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

718
00:48:37,893 --> 00:48:39,963
I just spoke to a Mr.
Kenneth Dahlberg...

719
00:48:40,053 --> 00:48:41,725
who says that he is
Midwest Finance Chairman.

720
00:48:41,813 --> 00:48:43,769
<i>Yeah, I know Ken Dahlberg.</i>

721
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:46,687
Well, I can't seem to get an
explanation on why a check...

722
00:48:46,773 --> 00:48:49,082
for $25,000 made out to Mr. Dahlberg...

723
00:48:49,173 --> 00:48:51,812
that he apparently sent to the
Committee to Re-Elect the President...

724
00:48:51,893 --> 00:48:53,884
would end up in the bank
account of a Watergate burglar.

725
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,008
<i>I don't know.</i>

726
00:48:55,093 --> 00:48:57,561
<i>- But you're head of the Committee, sir.
- Look, I just came aboard.</i>

727
00:48:57,653 --> 00:48:59,769
<i>John Mitchell was the head of
the Committee. He might know.</i>

728
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,525
Well, what would the
explanation possibly be...

729
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:02,648
<i>I don't know.</i>

730
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:04,530
<i>You're implying that I should know...</i>

731
00:49:04,613 --> 00:49:07,685
<i>and if you print that, our
relationship will be terminated.</i>

732
00:49:08,773 --> 00:49:10,206
Sir, we don't have a relationship.

733
00:49:10,293 --> 00:49:13,251
<i>The issues of the campaign
are peace and prosperity...</i>

734
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:14,925
<i>not a campaign check.</i>

735
00:49:15,173 --> 00:49:17,289
<i>- Bob.
- Sir, no one is saying...</i>

736
00:49:17,373 --> 00:49:19,967
<i>...this happened before I came on board.
- Mr. Dahlberg is on line 2.</i>

737
00:49:20,053 --> 00:49:22,203
<i>I'm running a campaign for the
re-election of the President.</i>

738
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,888
<i>We've raised $60 million and
you're asking about a $25,000 check.</i>

739
00:49:25,973 --> 00:49:28,612
Mr. MacGregor, excuse me, could
you hold one second, please?

740
00:49:28,693 --> 00:49:30,411
<i>- All right.
- Thank you. Yes?</i>

741
00:49:30,693 --> 00:49:32,046
<i>- Hello.
- Mr. Dahlberg?</i>

742
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:33,612
<i>- Yes?
- Could you please hold one second, sir?</i>

743
00:49:33,693 --> 00:49:34,842
<i>- Yes.
- Thank you.</i>

744
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:36,048
<i>- Mr. MacGregor?
- Yeah?</i>

745
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:37,964
Can I call you right
back, sir? I'm very sorry.

746
00:49:38,053 --> 00:49:39,486
<i>- Yeah, okay.
- Mr. Dahlberg.</i>

747
00:49:39,573 --> 00:49:42,690
<i>Yes. I'm sorry I hung up before.</i>

748
00:49:42,773 --> 00:49:45,810
<i>I wasn't sure you were a
Washington Post reporter.</i>

749
00:49:45,893 --> 00:49:48,851
I believe we were talking
about a $25,000 check.

750
00:49:50,173 --> 00:49:52,733
<i>Obviously this is difficult for me.</i>

751
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:56,291
<i>I'm caught in the middle
of something and...</i>

752
00:49:56,973 --> 00:49:58,531
<i>I don't know what.</i>

753
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:01,083
What do you think it could be?

754
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:03,564
<i>I deal with a lot of important people.</i>

755
00:50:03,653 --> 00:50:05,644
People who work for
the Committee? Hello?

756
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:07,166
<i>For the Committee.</i>

757
00:50:07,253 --> 00:50:09,687
<i>- The Committee to Re-Elect
the President? - Yes.</i>

758
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,446
<i>You see, I raised that money in cash...</i>

759
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:14,967
<i>and I have a winter home in Florida.</i>

760
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:18,045
<i>- Is that Miami?
- Boca Raton...</i>

761
00:50:18,453 --> 00:50:20,887
<i>and I didn't want to
carry all that cash around.</i>

762
00:50:20,973 --> 00:50:23,487
<i>- Now, you can understand that.
- Of course I can.</i>

763
00:50:23,573 --> 00:50:26,246
<i>So, I had it exchanged
for the cashier's check.</i>

764
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:29,405
And how do you think it
got into Barker's account?

765
00:50:31,253 --> 00:50:33,972
<i>I know I shouldn't
be telling you this...</i>

766
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:38,973
<i>I gave it to Mr. Stans.</i>

767
00:50:42,093 --> 00:50:43,492
I beg your pardon?

768
00:50:43,973 --> 00:50:45,725
<i>I gave it to Stans.</i>

769
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:47,246
Maurice Stans?

770
00:50:47,733 --> 00:50:50,884
<i>- The head of finance for Nixon?
- Yes, in Washington.</i>

771
00:50:50,973 --> 00:50:54,522
<i>Now what he did with
it, I really do not know.</i>

772
00:50:54,853 --> 00:50:58,482
I see. Were there any other checks that
you might be aware of, that could...

773
00:50:58,573 --> 00:51:00,723
<i>That's all I have to say.</i>

774
00:51:01,813 --> 00:51:04,486
<i>Mr. MacGregor... Mr. Dahlberg...</i>

775
00:51:05,013 --> 00:51:06,969
I'm sorry. Thank you very much.

776
00:51:23,653 --> 00:51:24,722
- Bob?
- Yeah.

777
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:27,486
- Carl Bernstein on line 1.
- One?

778
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:29,528
<i>- Yeah?
- Woodward?</i>

779
00:51:29,613 --> 00:51:31,331
<i>- Bernstein.
- I think I got a lead on Dahlberg.</i>

780
00:51:31,413 --> 00:51:32,846
<i>- I just... I got it.
- What?</i>

781
00:51:32,933 --> 00:51:34,525
I just talked to him.
I just hung up from him.

782
00:51:34,613 --> 00:51:36,285
Bernstein, listen, it
goes all the way to Stans!

783
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:38,364
<i>- What're you talking about?
- It goes all the way to Stans.</i>

784
00:51:38,453 --> 00:51:40,603
He gave the check to Stans
for the Committee to Re-Elect!

785
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:43,571
<i>- Did he say that?
- He said it. I've got it in my notes.</i>

786
00:51:43,653 --> 00:51:45,245
<i>- Jesus.
- It's down on record, Bernstein.</i>

787
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:47,972
<i>That money winds up in the bank
account of a Watergate burglar?</i>

788
00:51:48,053 --> 00:51:49,884
<i>- Yes!
- Fantastic. I'm coming home.</i>

789
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,008
Okay.

790
00:51:52,573 --> 00:51:55,804
<i>... catapulted the unknown Senator from
Missouri into national prominence...</i>

791
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:57,406
<i>by naming Eagleton as his running mate.</i>

792
00:52:02,213 --> 00:52:04,090
<i>... bolstering of support
for the Democratic ticket...</i>

793
00:52:04,493 --> 00:52:07,007
Scott, what happened with that Taiwan
thing you were telling us about?

794
00:52:07,093 --> 00:52:09,448
Japan is going to break
diplomatic ties with Taiwan...

795
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:11,091
when they recognize Red China.

796
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:13,846
The irony, of course, that's a direct
result of Nixon's visit to China.

797
00:52:13,933 --> 00:52:15,889
Jesus, what did he tell
them? What did he say to them?

798
00:52:15,973 --> 00:52:18,203
Incidentally, that's a
great parallel story...

799
00:52:18,293 --> 00:52:20,932
if you're going to do
that piece on détente.

800
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,528
Right, "Queen Elizabeth
proclaims a state of emergency...

801
00:52:23,613 --> 00:52:25,683
"to deal with what we call
a 'dock strike' ".

802
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:27,047
Breaking it off...

803
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:30,171
I'll give you a human interest.

804
00:52:30,253 --> 00:52:32,164
"Thirty-one days of rain
in the Philippines...

805
00:52:32,253 --> 00:52:34,608
"is being blamed on the
theft of a statue of Jesus".

806
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,445
We had one like that before.

807
00:52:38,493 --> 00:52:41,530
- I'll put my best writer on that.
- What about the one in India?

808
00:52:41,813 --> 00:52:44,646
Laugh, gentlemen, it'll be
the only story everyone reads.

809
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:45,848
Okay, National?

810
00:52:45,933 --> 00:52:49,243
We have the Bremer diary.
"Wish to kill Nixon".

811
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,803
He took a car trip to New York,
Ottawa, and Washington to kill him.

812
00:52:53,533 --> 00:52:56,411
We have the "Senate
approving the ABM Treaty".

813
00:52:56,733 --> 00:52:57,802
ABM.

814
00:52:57,893 --> 00:53:00,805
Of course, we have "McGovern
offering the VP spot..."

815
00:53:00,893 --> 00:53:02,326
to everybody.

816
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:03,687
- Yeah, that's news.
- I have...

817
00:53:03,773 --> 00:53:05,092
Because everybody's been offered it.

818
00:53:05,173 --> 00:53:09,086
Now, I'll tell you what will be news.
When somebody accepts it. That's news.

819
00:53:09,373 --> 00:53:11,204
Here is some great art.

820
00:53:12,013 --> 00:53:15,767
McGovern and Humphrey at
breakfast, smiling their asses off.

821
00:53:15,853 --> 00:53:17,411
Isn't that great?

822
00:53:17,853 --> 00:53:21,209
- He says, "I am George's friend..."
- Why is that man smiling?

823
00:53:22,053 --> 00:53:23,645
Sounds friendly. Very friendly.

824
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,486
"I'll be helping him in ways
he never dreamed possible".

825
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:28,291
Breakfast followed by lunch.

826
00:53:30,293 --> 00:53:31,487
Okay. Metro?

827
00:53:31,573 --> 00:53:33,928
Well, we got the
schoolteachers on Capitol Hill.

828
00:53:34,013 --> 00:53:38,052
They want a 17% increase in pay
or this fall they go on strike.

829
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:41,125
Harry, I think we could mention
that this might be the time...

830
00:53:41,213 --> 00:53:43,647
to go to the front page
on the district home rule.

831
00:53:43,733 --> 00:53:45,530
- Oh, come on!
- Listen to him.

832
00:53:45,613 --> 00:53:48,366
Ben, this time it could go all the way.

833
00:53:48,453 --> 00:53:51,331
The House is going to vote next
week on a Senate resolution.

834
00:53:51,413 --> 00:53:53,802
Okay then, well, when they
pass it, we'll run with it.

835
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:56,202
Okay, fellas, let's go
around again now. Foreign?

836
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,371
Taiwan emergency, Philippines.

837
00:53:58,453 --> 00:53:59,772
Okay, fine. National?

838
00:53:59,853 --> 00:54:01,366
I'll stand on the
Eagleton follow-ups...

839
00:54:01,453 --> 00:54:03,125
McGovern not being able
to get a replacement.

840
00:54:03,213 --> 00:54:05,966
He's offered it to Humphrey, Kennedy,
and Ribicoff. All turned him down.

841
00:54:06,053 --> 00:54:07,281
That's the Page 1 lead right there.

842
00:54:07,373 --> 00:54:10,012
You're ignoring the importance
of the Dahlberg repercussions.

843
00:54:10,093 --> 00:54:12,209
Nobody cares about the
Dahlberg repercussions.

844
00:54:12,293 --> 00:54:14,807
Now look, it was our story that
got the General Accounting Office...

845
00:54:14,893 --> 00:54:16,804
to start an audit with CREEP Finance.

846
00:54:16,893 --> 00:54:20,249
We printed that didn't we? When the
frigging audit's done, we'll print that, too.

847
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:22,130
Let me tell you what happened today.

848
00:54:22,213 --> 00:54:24,681
I was having lunch at
the Sans Souci, and...

849
00:54:27,213 --> 00:54:29,204
this White House guy,
a good one, a pro...

850
00:54:29,293 --> 00:54:32,569
came up and asked me, "What is this
Watergate compulsion with you guys?"

851
00:54:32,653 --> 00:54:35,770
Compulsion? This is a story.
This is not compulsion.

852
00:54:36,053 --> 00:54:38,408
I said, "Well, we think it's important".
And he said:

853
00:54:38,493 --> 00:54:42,168
"If it's so goddamn important, who in
the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?"

854
00:54:42,253 --> 00:54:44,244
Now, what do you expect him
to say from the White House?

855
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:45,607
"You're doing a great job"?

856
00:54:45,693 --> 00:54:48,082
Why don't you ask him
what he's really saying?

857
00:54:48,173 --> 00:54:50,448
He wants to take the story
away from Woodstein and...

858
00:54:50,533 --> 00:54:52,569
- give it to his National desk.
- At least I have...

859
00:54:52,653 --> 00:54:55,121
some experienced guys sitting
around who know the politicians...

860
00:54:55,213 --> 00:54:57,283
- who have the contacts.
- We're aware of that.

861
00:54:57,413 --> 00:54:59,051
You said it. Sitting around.

862
00:54:59,933 --> 00:55:02,447
Ben, it's a dangerous
story for this paper.

863
00:55:03,173 --> 00:55:06,290
- What if your boys get it wrong?
- Then it's our ass, isn't it?

864
00:55:06,373 --> 00:55:08,728
We all have to go out
and work for a living.

865
00:55:09,533 --> 00:55:11,444
National gets eight columns.

866
00:55:11,533 --> 00:55:13,091
Nine for Foreign.

867
00:55:13,533 --> 00:55:15,285
Metro, 15.

868
00:55:16,253 --> 00:55:17,686
That's it, fellas.

869
00:55:21,853 --> 00:55:23,923
Hey, Scott, I need to see you.

870
00:55:26,093 --> 00:55:27,082
How dangerous?

871
00:55:32,191 --> 00:55:35,945
Well, it's not just that we're using
unnamed sources that bothers me...

872
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:39,307
or that everything we print,
the White House denies...

873
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,828
or that almost no other papers
are reprinting our stuff.

874
00:55:42,911 --> 00:55:44,185
What then?

875
00:55:44,631 --> 00:55:46,986
Look, there are over 2,000
reporters in this town...

876
00:55:47,071 --> 00:55:49,107
are there five on Watergate?

877
00:55:49,871 --> 00:55:53,341
<i>Where did the Washington Post
suddenly get the monopoly on wisdom?</i>

878
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:56,382
Why would the Republicans do it?

879
00:55:56,991 --> 00:56:01,064
McGovern is self-destructing, just like
Humphrey, Muskie, the bunch of them.

880
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,903
I don't believe their story.

881
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:07,828
It doesn't make sense.

882
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:11,185
Yeah, Bernstein.

883
00:56:11,991 --> 00:56:13,504
Now? All right.

884
00:56:13,911 --> 00:56:16,345
Woodward, Bradlee will see us now.

885
00:56:16,431 --> 00:56:17,830
Answer the phone for me, will you?

886
00:56:17,911 --> 00:56:20,948
<i>Are you trying to find the lowest
possible common denominator...</i>

887
00:56:39,151 --> 00:56:40,550
Ben, it's the hottest item.

888
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:42,189
- It's in over 500 papers.
- What is it?

889
00:56:42,271 --> 00:56:44,227
Yesterday's weather report
for people who were drunk...

890
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:45,505
and slept all day.

891
00:56:45,591 --> 00:56:46,660
Jesus! Send it out...

892
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:48,469
<i>to the San Francisco
Chronicle. They need it.</i>

893
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:49,870
- How about the crossword puzzle?
- No.

894
00:56:49,951 --> 00:56:51,179
Anagrams?

895
00:56:51,871 --> 00:56:53,748
- No space, Mickey.
- Goodbye.

896
00:56:54,071 --> 00:56:56,426
The last thing you bought
from me was the obituaries.

897
00:56:56,511 --> 00:56:58,308
- Make him buy something, will you?
- All right.

898
00:56:58,391 --> 00:56:59,790
Hey, what do you guys want?

899
00:56:59,871 --> 00:57:02,749
The GAO report's due out the
morning of Nixon's renomination.

900
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:04,105
Sit down.

901
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,661
Well, that's two weeks from now.

902
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:09,109
Since they're only
responsible to Congress...

903
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:11,989
there's no way the White House
can control the investigation.

904
00:57:12,071 --> 00:57:14,301
There's a source over at General
Accounting that tells us...

905
00:57:14,391 --> 00:57:17,701
there's a whole rat's nest of
illegal shit going on over at CREEP.

906
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:19,543
- Like what?
- Like a slush fund.

907
00:57:19,631 --> 00:57:22,191
Hundreds of thousands of
dollars of unaccounted-for cash.

908
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:23,784
Hundreds of thousands of dollars?

909
00:57:23,871 --> 00:57:25,065
Any comment from CREEP?

910
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,381
Yes. Unavailable for
comment. They're not talking.

911
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:30,781
But what else besides the
money? Where's the goddamn story?

912
00:57:32,631 --> 00:57:34,508
The money's the key to whatever this is.

913
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:36,070
- Says who?
- Deep Throat.

914
00:57:36,151 --> 00:57:38,267
- Who?
- Oh, that's Woodward's garage freak...

915
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:39,909
his source in the executive...

916
00:57:39,991 --> 00:57:43,586
Garage freak? Jesus, what kind
of a crazy, fucking story is this?

917
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,544
Who did you say?

918
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:51,147
He's on deep background.
I call him "Deep Throat".

919
00:57:52,311 --> 00:57:54,188
Look, McGovern's dropped to nothing...

920
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:56,102
Nixon's guaranteed the renomination...

921
00:57:56,191 --> 00:57:58,147
<i>and the Post is stuck with
a story no one else wants.</i>

922
00:57:58,231 --> 00:57:59,744
It'll sink the goddamn paper.

923
00:57:59,831 --> 00:58:02,186
Everyone says, "Get off it, Ben".
And I come on very sage...

924
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:04,990
and I say, "You'll see.
You wait till this bottoms out".

925
00:58:05,071 --> 00:58:08,222
But the truth is, I can't
figure out what we've got.

926
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,349
What else are you working on?

927
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:14,308
We're after a list of CREEP employees.

928
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:16,507
- Where is it?
- It's classified.

929
00:58:16,711 --> 00:58:19,703
- How are you gonna get it?
- We haven't had any luck, yet.

930
00:58:20,071 --> 00:58:21,220
Get some.

931
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:27,625
Anything else?

932
00:58:37,191 --> 00:58:39,227
You made a mistake in there.

933
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:43,740
What?

934
00:58:44,031 --> 00:58:45,987
You said to Brad that we
haven't had any luck yet...

935
00:58:46,071 --> 00:58:48,631
and that's the thing that he jumps
on. You can't talk about luck.

936
00:58:48,711 --> 00:58:52,260
If you can't talk in specifics,
you shouldn't say anything.

937
00:58:57,231 --> 00:58:59,062
Is there any place you don't smoke?

938
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,310
- What?
- Hold it.

939
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:05,741
- What're you doing?
- Kay Eddy.

940
00:59:05,831 --> 00:59:08,743
Doesn't she go with a guy that
works for the Committee to Re-Elect?

941
00:59:09,151 --> 00:59:10,584
<i>- The E.R.
- All right.</i>

942
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:12,821
- Eddy? Hey. Kay, can...
- Just a second.

943
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:17,100
<i>- 757-6521. - Okay, I'll get
back to you on this, thanks.</i>

944
00:59:18,151 --> 00:59:21,587
Don't you go with a guy that works
for the Committee to Re-Elect?

945
00:59:22,391 --> 00:59:24,268
- Not anymore.
- You did go with him, though.

946
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:26,103
I think you were engaged
to him, weren't you?

947
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:28,182
- Yeah.
- You got out of it?

948
00:59:29,591 --> 00:59:31,786
- So?
- You're looking better.

949
00:59:34,591 --> 00:59:36,582
Look, we need a list of
the people that work there.

950
00:59:36,671 --> 00:59:38,309
<i>Do you think that...</i>

951
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:40,382
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

952
00:59:41,391 --> 00:59:42,585
It's personal.

953
00:59:42,671 --> 00:59:45,026
What do you mean? You said it was over.

954
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:50,099
You're asking me to
use a guy I care about.

955
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:52,785
- No. We're not asking you to use him...
- Well, sure...

956
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:55,260
...just to help us. I mean,
we'd do the same for you.

957
00:59:55,351 --> 00:59:57,467
My only chance of getting
that story is if I see him.

958
00:59:57,551 --> 00:59:59,303
I don't want to see him again.

959
00:59:59,391 --> 01:00:01,621
- Do you have to see him?
- Sure, I have to see him.

960
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:02,985
No. Do you have to see him that way?

961
01:00:03,071 --> 01:00:04,743
Can't you just call him
up on the telephone...

962
01:00:04,831 --> 01:00:06,981
and say you want to have a drink
with him, just feel him out?

963
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:10,666
You say the relationship is over.
What the hell do you have to lose?

964
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:12,785
Forget it.

965
01:00:13,391 --> 01:00:15,666
We don't want you to do anything
that would embarrass you...

966
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:18,140
or that you don't feel right about.

967
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:20,105
Forget it.

968
01:00:28,431 --> 01:00:31,309
Don't let her just get off. I think
she was going to say something.

969
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:33,905
You just overdramatized it, she
was going to give us what we want.

970
01:00:33,991 --> 01:00:35,026
It's over.

971
01:00:35,111 --> 01:00:36,464
- What?
- It's over.

972
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:20,984
Is this the whole list?

973
01:01:21,071 --> 01:01:24,586
Look what it says. "Personnel,
Committee to Re-Elect the President".

974
01:01:26,511 --> 01:01:29,071
This is all in alphabetical order.
You can't tell who works for who.

975
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:32,109
Well, find out the department heads
like Mitchell, Magruder, Stans.

976
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:33,385
Here. John Mitchell.

977
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:34,950
- What's the number?
- 301.

978
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:37,499
All right. Find somebody
who has a number close to it.

979
01:01:37,591 --> 01:01:39,149
- They probably work for him.
- There's a 303.

980
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:40,300
Okay.

981
01:01:42,511 --> 01:01:46,026
<i>Okay, we have to find out how the money
got from Maurice Stans to the burglars.</i>

982
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,067
<i>Somebody who worked in Finance.</i>

983
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:51,629
<i>All right. Here's the head of
Finance. Maurice Stans, 269.</i>

984
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:54,509
<i>If we can just get somebody
who works under Stans.</i>

985
01:01:55,271 --> 01:01:57,227
<i>- Sloan? You need him?
- He's the treasurer.</i>

986
01:01:57,311 --> 01:01:59,267
<i>- What's the number?
- Hugh Sloan, 287.</i>

987
01:01:59,351 --> 01:02:01,069
<i>Is there a secretary?</i>

988
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,709
<i>Wait a minute. Manley.
Here it is. Irene Manley?</i>

989
01:02:06,511 --> 01:02:08,866
<i>1406 Lee Jackson Memorial Highway.</i>

990
01:02:09,231 --> 01:02:11,381
- Hi, I'm Bob Woodward.
- I'm Carl Bernstein.

991
01:02:11,471 --> 01:02:12,540
<i>We're from the Washington Post.</i>

992
01:02:12,631 --> 01:02:14,826
We'd like to know if we could
speak to you for a few minutes.

993
01:02:14,911 --> 01:02:17,300
We understand your daughter works
for the Committee to Re-Elect.

994
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:20,383
- Wouldn't be anything embarrassing.
- Would you object to just...

995
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:23,506
- Yes?
- Hi.

996
01:02:23,591 --> 01:02:24,944
Miss Milland? Betty Milland?

997
01:02:25,031 --> 01:02:26,749
- I'm Bob Woodward.
- Carl Bernstein.

998
01:02:26,831 --> 01:02:28,105
<i>We're from the Washington Post.</i>

999
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:30,830
<i>I know you're trying to
do your job. I mean...</i>

1000
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:33,427
You don't understand the
pressure that we're under.

1001
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:36,548
It'll just take a couple of seconds. If
we can just come in for a couple of...

1002
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:38,349
- No, I really don't...
- We don't want to come in.

1003
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:40,183
We understand that there
was some documents...

1004
01:02:40,271 --> 01:02:42,023
that were shredded at the Committee.

1005
01:02:42,111 --> 01:02:43,464
<i>Well, there...</i>

1006
01:02:43,671 --> 01:02:46,060
There's often shredding.
We do that a lot.

1007
01:02:46,151 --> 01:02:48,346
- Were you there during the shredding?
- Yes, I was.

1008
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,945
I see. Were there any
department heads from...

1009
01:02:51,031 --> 01:02:52,669
the Committee who were also present?

1010
01:02:52,751 --> 01:02:55,219
Yes. Mr. Mitchell came in one night.

1011
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,541
John Mitchell? The Attorney General?

1012
01:02:57,991 --> 01:03:00,824
He was carrying a
raincoat over his head.

1013
01:03:01,871 --> 01:03:04,101
<i>I thought he was going to go...</i>

1014
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:06,349
Did he supervise the shredding?

1015
01:03:06,431 --> 01:03:09,901
<i>Can I not answer any more
questions? I'd just soon not...</i>

1016
01:03:10,031 --> 01:03:11,942
Okay? Maybe I could call you?

1017
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:16,268
- Are you being told not to talk?
- Will you call us?

1018
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:18,230
I don't know.

1019
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:19,780
I'll try.

1020
01:03:19,871 --> 01:03:22,260
What about all that shredding
that took place after the break-in?

1021
01:03:22,351 --> 01:03:24,262
Need to know more about the
papers that were in shredding.

1022
01:03:24,351 --> 01:03:25,909
I think you've some idea
what's in the papers...

1023
01:03:25,991 --> 01:03:27,788
when the former Attorney
General comes to the office...

1024
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,509
when it's taking place at
the Committee to Re-Elect...

1025
01:03:29,591 --> 01:03:31,468
and got a raincoat over his
head. Why's he in a raincoat?

1026
01:03:31,551 --> 01:03:32,904
Could be raining is
what could've happened.

1027
01:03:32,991 --> 01:03:34,140
Let me go through the story again.

1028
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:36,461
You got a woman who's frightened
at the door. Works for CREEP.

1029
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:39,543
She said there's shredding taking place.
We don't know what's in the papers.

1030
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:42,589
We know the former Attorney General
comes in with an overcoat over his head.

1031
01:03:42,671 --> 01:03:44,309
It could be raining.
There's a lawyer present.

1032
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:46,541
We don't know what he asked
them. She wouldn't talk about it.

1033
01:03:46,631 --> 01:03:48,349
Now, will you please tell
me where there's a story?

1034
01:03:48,431 --> 01:03:51,548
There's a story in the fact that the
interview did not take place in her home...

1035
01:03:51,631 --> 01:03:53,189
but in the office of the
Committee to Re-Elect.

1036
01:03:53,271 --> 01:03:54,750
How's there a story in
that? It's not enough!

1037
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,742
There's a story because
there's a lawyer in the office.

1038
01:03:56,831 --> 01:03:58,822
- I mean, you're more resistant than she is.
- That's right.

1039
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:00,788
- Why?
- Because there's not enough fact.

1040
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,743
<i>Well, let's just turn around and
go back and question her again.</i>

1041
01:04:06,671 --> 01:04:09,390
- This won't take long at all. We just want...
- Please go away, okay?

1042
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,826
Will you please leave
before they see you.

1043
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:14,950
- Who did you mean by...
- Who do you mean, "they"?

1044
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:16,909
Could you give us their names?

1045
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:20,347
We haven't revealed the sources
of people that have talked to us.

1046
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:23,307
You know, I really can't
talk about this because...

1047
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:25,666
Would "they" be members
of the Committee?

1048
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,103
<i>Someone got to that woman.</i>

1049
01:04:30,191 --> 01:04:31,670
<i>It's the key to the whole cover-up.</i>

1050
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:33,343
<i>How can you write that
there's a cover-up?</i>

1051
01:04:33,431 --> 01:04:34,830
<i>We don't know that there's a cover-up!</i>

1052
01:04:34,911 --> 01:04:36,742
Well, then, I don't know
what the hell you need.

1053
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,947
So, you tell me what you need.

1054
01:04:39,391 --> 01:04:41,222
I need more fact for a
story is what I need...

1055
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:42,869
and I think you should
need the same thing.

1056
01:04:42,951 --> 01:04:44,669
Okay, if you get in the car...

1057
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:47,311
and there's music playing
in the car, hypothetically.

1058
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:49,302
There's music playing in
the car for 10 minutes...

1059
01:04:49,391 --> 01:04:51,859
and there's no commercial.
What can you deduce from that?

1060
01:04:51,951 --> 01:04:53,384
- Is it AM or FM?
- Come on, Bernstein!

1061
01:04:53,471 --> 01:04:54,665
Is it AM or FM?

1062
01:04:54,751 --> 01:04:58,346
A guy can come up to me on the
street and he can ask me an address.

1063
01:04:58,631 --> 01:05:01,429
Now, is the man interrogating
me, or is he lost?

1064
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:02,830
What kind of a story do I write?

1065
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:04,742
What kind of a deduction
do I make from that?

1066
01:05:04,831 --> 01:05:07,982
Because you don't have a gut feeling
that the woman is trying to help us?

1067
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,824
No, I don't have enough gut
feeling and I wish I did.

1068
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:14,100
<i>We're from the Washington Post...</i>

1069
01:05:18,151 --> 01:05:21,063
<i>Abbott, Addis, Agusto, Albus...</i>

1070
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:31,705
<i>Is there something that
strikes you as odd about this?</i>

1071
01:05:31,791 --> 01:05:33,543
<i>- What?
- It's almost like there's a pattern...</i>

1072
01:05:33,631 --> 01:05:34,666
<i>to the way they're not talking.</i>

1073
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:37,788
<i>The way they say "no"all
the time. I think it's odd.</i>

1074
01:05:38,231 --> 01:05:39,903
- Mrs. Hambling?
- Yes.

1075
01:05:40,111 --> 01:05:42,341
<i>Hi, we're from the Washington Post.</i>

1076
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:44,342
I'm Carl Bernstein,
this is Bob Woodward.

1077
01:05:44,431 --> 01:05:47,343
A friend of the Committee
said that we could contact you.

1078
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:49,387
- Who was it?
- We can't reveal that.

1079
01:05:49,471 --> 01:05:51,780
You can talk to us. We
don't reveal our sources.

1080
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,350
<i>You people...</i>

1081
01:05:54,311 --> 01:05:57,542
You think you can come into
my home, ask a few questions...

1082
01:05:58,111 --> 01:06:02,423
have me destroy the reputations
of men that I work for and respect?

1083
01:06:04,031 --> 01:06:05,987
Do you understand loyalty?

1084
01:06:06,351 --> 01:06:08,307
Have you ever heard of loyalty?

1085
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:10,785
- Hi.
- Yes?

1086
01:06:10,991 --> 01:06:12,026
I'm Bob Woodward.

1087
01:06:12,111 --> 01:06:13,908
<i>Carl Bernstein. We're
from the Washington Post.</i>

1088
01:06:13,991 --> 01:06:15,060
Yes.

1089
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:17,870
I've read what you've
written. I want to thank you.

1090
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:22,027
I've been a Republican all my life,
but this goes beyond party politics.

1091
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:24,579
Would you mind if we
asked you a few questions?

1092
01:06:24,671 --> 01:06:27,105
No. Come in. Would you like coffee?

1093
01:06:28,111 --> 01:06:29,180
Sure.

1094
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:32,264
What they've done is a
threat to the Constitution.

1095
01:06:32,351 --> 01:06:34,581
It goes against everything we stand for.

1096
01:06:34,671 --> 01:06:37,344
Could you be a little bit
more specific than that?

1097
01:06:37,431 --> 01:06:40,104
I'm afraid your articles have
just scratched the surface.

1098
01:06:40,191 --> 01:06:42,910
You don't mind if I just
take a few notes, do you?

1099
01:06:42,991 --> 01:06:44,026
No.

1100
01:06:44,991 --> 01:06:47,300
How long have you
worked at the Committee?

1101
01:06:47,631 --> 01:06:48,700
Committee?

1102
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:51,589
Yes, the Committee to
Re-Elect the President.

1103
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:56,540
Oh, I don't work at the Committee
to Re-Elect the President.

1104
01:06:56,751 --> 01:07:00,221
I work at Garfinkel's, in
the accounting department.

1105
01:07:04,191 --> 01:07:05,863
- Miss Abbott?
- Yes.

1106
01:07:07,551 --> 01:07:08,984
Judith Abbott?

1107
01:07:11,271 --> 01:07:12,750
Carolyn Abbott.

1108
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:17,820
We're just doing something wrong.

1109
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:22,182
- Never been there.
- No.

1110
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:25,267
We're doing something wrong.

1111
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:27,827
It's just not good enough.

1112
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:31,308
How can you keep going at something
past the point when you believe it?

1113
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:33,427
We just have to start all over again.

<i>If we could only get somebody
that worked for Finance to talk.</i>

1120
01:07:53,631 --> 01:07:54,700
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

1121
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:56,349
<i>- What about the bookkeeper?
- Which bookkeeper?</i>

1122
01:07:56,431 --> 01:07:58,228
<i>The bookkeeper that worked
for both Slans and...</i>

1123
01:07:58,311 --> 01:08:00,267
<i>- Oh, you're all right.
- Sloan and Stans.</i>

1124
01:08:00,351 --> 01:08:03,149
<i>I've been there. I've called
her twice. There's no answer.</i>

1125
01:08:03,231 --> 01:08:05,028

Two weeks work, half the names
crossed off and what've you got?

1137
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,669
People aren't talking, Harry.

1138
01:08:43,751 --> 01:08:46,424
And it's the way they're
not talking that's unnatural.

1139
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:49,549
Harry, we've been up all night. We
went over all the quotes of the people.

1140
01:08:49,631 --> 01:08:52,270
- Slamming doors in our faces.
- It's like they're getting instructions.

1141
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,103
Want to hear some real news?

1142
01:08:54,751 --> 01:08:56,946
That GAO report in which
you placed so much faith...

1143
01:08:57,031 --> 01:08:59,499
well, it's been postponed till
after tonight's renomination.

1144
01:08:59,591 --> 01:09:02,185
- What do you mean?
- Hughes got a call from Stans in Florida.

1145
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,580
Says he has new information,
not to republish without it.

1146
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:07,231
They're going to bury the report
until after the renomination.

1147
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:10,064
The Grand Jury indictment will be
out soon and every indication says...

1148
01:09:10,151 --> 01:09:13,063
the indictment will stop at the
five burglars, Hunt and Liddy.

1149
01:09:13,431 --> 01:09:15,501
And that's the end of your story.

1150
01:09:19,991 --> 01:09:23,142
<i>The vote of all the
delegates has been recorded.</i>

1151
01:09:25,351 --> 01:09:28,582
<i>The vote for Richard Nixon...</i>

1152
01:09:30,431 --> 01:09:33,582
<i>is 1,347.</i>

1153
01:09:34,831 --> 01:09:38,107
<i>The vote for Paul McCloskey is one.</i>

1154
01:09:42,631 --> 01:09:44,826
<i>And therefore I declare the
nominee of the Republican Party...</i>

1155
01:09:46,511 --> 01:09:49,025
<i>for President of the United States...</i>

1156
01:09:49,751 --> 01:09:51,901
<i>President Richard Nixon.</i>

1157
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:01,903
<i>Four more years!</i>

1158
01:10:18,151 --> 01:10:22,861
<i>The President, and the future President
of the United States of America!</i>

1159
01:10:24,431 --> 01:10:26,661
<i>Wonderful young faces I see out there.</i>

1160
01:10:26,751 --> 01:10:30,426
<i>Your enthusiasm, your
idealism, your hard work.</i>

1161
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:35,146
<i>This is your first vote,
and years from now...</i>

1162
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,222
<i>I just hope you can all look back...</i>

1163
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,303
<i>and say it was one of
your best votes. Thank you.</i>

1164
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:06,590
<i>Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of
the Washington Post and...</i>

1165
01:11:06,671 --> 01:11:08,946
I just want to ask you
a couple of questions.

1166
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,067
Well, you don't want
me. You want my sister.

1167
01:11:11,151 --> 01:11:13,381
It's for you. It's Carl Bernstein.

1168
01:11:13,471 --> 01:11:15,427
<i>Oh, my God. He's the guy
from the Post. Get rid of him.</i>

1169
01:11:15,511 --> 01:11:17,388
Could I just borrow one
of your cigarettes there?

1170
01:11:17,471 --> 01:11:18,540
Sure.

1171
01:11:19,991 --> 01:11:21,265
You've really got to go.

1172
01:11:21,351 --> 01:11:23,421
Sure. Could I just get a match?

1173
01:11:24,711 --> 01:11:26,110
I can understand your being afraid.

1174
01:11:26,191 --> 01:11:28,182
There's a lot of people at
the Committee just like you...

1175
01:11:28,271 --> 01:11:31,468
who wanted to tell the truth
but some people wouldn't listen.

1176
01:11:31,911 --> 01:11:35,028
Certain people have gone back
to the prosecutors and the FBI...

1177
01:11:35,111 --> 01:11:37,830
to give information which
they were never asked.

1178
01:11:39,471 --> 01:11:43,066
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when
he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance...

1179
01:11:43,151 --> 01:11:45,540
and we were just
wondering if you were...

1180
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:49,420
promoted to work for Mr. Stans
immediately after Mr. Sloan quit...

1181
01:11:49,511 --> 01:11:51,979
or whether there was some time lapse?

1182
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,100
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.

1183
01:12:00,471 --> 01:12:03,429
Can I get you some coffee or something?

1184
01:12:03,551 --> 01:12:05,382
Yeah. Thanks very much.

1185
01:12:09,711 --> 01:12:10,939
Door sticks.

1186
01:12:14,671 --> 01:12:17,026
Could I just sit down for a second?

1187
01:12:19,831 --> 01:12:23,141
Sure, you can sit down, but I'm
not going to tell you anything.

1188
01:12:24,431 --> 01:12:25,500
Okay.

1189
01:12:46,351 --> 01:12:48,740
I was just curious
why you lied just then.

1190
01:12:49,271 --> 01:12:52,229
Have you been threatened
if you tell the truth?

1191
01:12:53,231 --> 01:12:54,266
No.

1192
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:57,109
Never in so many words.

1193
01:12:57,831 --> 01:12:59,025
- How do you like it?
- Just milk.

1194
01:12:59,111 --> 01:13:00,829
- Thanks.
- Okay, I'll just get that.

1195
01:13:01,351 --> 01:13:05,230
I saw in the wires that Mrs.
Stans was in the hospital.

1196
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:07,108
Is she feeling better?

1197
01:13:11,951 --> 01:13:15,068
The GAO, the General
Accounting Report said that...

1198
01:13:15,911 --> 01:13:20,348
there was $350,000 in the safe of the
Committee to Re-Elect the President.

1199
01:13:21,351 --> 01:13:24,946
Were you aware that it was that kind
of funds from the very beginning?

1200
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:32,109
A lot of people are watching
me. They know I know a lot.

1201
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,343
Was it all in $100 bills?

1202
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,230
A lot of it was.

1203
01:13:37,511 --> 01:13:40,105
I thought it was an
all-purpose, political fund...

1204
01:13:40,191 --> 01:13:43,069
you know, for taking fat cats
to dinner, things like that.

1205
01:13:43,151 --> 01:13:45,028
$350,000 for dinners?

1206
01:13:47,671 --> 01:13:49,263
How was it paid out?

1207
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:55,264
Not in one big chunk.

1208
01:13:57,311 --> 01:13:59,779
There was a list of 15 names
and the amount of money...

1209
01:13:59,871 --> 01:14:02,066
given to each person next to the name.

1210
01:14:02,751 --> 01:14:04,548
What happened to the list?

1211
01:14:06,431 --> 01:14:09,264
It was destroyed. It
was the only record.

1212
01:14:11,231 --> 01:14:14,143
Don't pay attention to
this. This is for my memory.

1213
01:14:16,711 --> 01:14:18,622
I have a very bad memory.

1214
01:14:19,791 --> 01:14:21,509
You won't be quoted by name.

1215
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:24,628
In fact, we get confirmations
before we print anything.

1216
01:14:24,711 --> 01:14:26,110
I can't be...

1217
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,309
positive that that money was used
for the break-in, you understand?

1218
01:14:29,391 --> 01:14:30,665
Yes, I do.

1219
01:14:31,071 --> 01:14:33,869
- But, people sure are worried.
- Which people?

1220
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:44,185
Think you could help me with
the disbursement of money...

1221
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:47,866
in terms of the number of people
that were involved? How many?

1222
01:14:50,471 --> 01:14:53,110
A group of them. About five.
I don't know their names.

1223
01:14:53,191 --> 01:14:55,625
Would Mr. Sloan know?

1224
01:15:00,391 --> 01:15:03,303
- Would he...
- I don't want to say anymore, okay?

1225
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:14,029
I won't be much longer.

1226
01:15:16,151 --> 01:15:19,621
I wondered if you could just
help me a little bit about...

1227
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:23,110
the money. We hear all kinds of figures.

1228
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:30,181
- There's so much of it.
- How much is "so much"?

1229
01:15:30,311 --> 01:15:33,587
In one two-day period,
$6 million came in.

1230
01:15:34,591 --> 01:15:37,185
- Six!
- Six million, cash.

1231
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:41,381
We didn't know where to put it all.

1232
01:15:42,511 --> 01:15:45,708
I thought it was all legal.
I mean, I guess I did until...

1233
01:15:45,911 --> 01:15:48,869
after the break-in when I
remembered Gordon got so much of it.

1234
01:15:48,951 --> 01:15:51,385
- This is Mr. Liddy?
- It's all so rotten.

1235
01:15:53,151 --> 01:15:54,664
It's getting worse.

1236
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:58,065
And the only one I care
about is Hugh Sloan.

1237
01:15:58,671 --> 01:16:02,664
His wife was going to leave him if he
didn't stand up and do what was right.

1238
01:16:03,031 --> 01:16:04,384
So, he quit.

1239
01:16:05,751 --> 01:16:07,343
I was wondering...

1240
01:16:09,071 --> 01:16:13,462
if Hugh Sloan was being set up now
as a fall guy for John Mitchell.

1241
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:16,024
What do you think?

1242
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:27,227
If you guys could get John
Mitchell, that would be beautiful.

1243
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:36,424
Coffee's cold.

1244
01:16:38,631 --> 01:16:40,508
Is there any evidence that...

1245
01:16:41,631 --> 01:16:43,940
any of Mr. Mitchell's assistants...

1246
01:16:45,631 --> 01:16:47,144
were part of this?

1247
01:16:47,631 --> 01:16:51,385
I had all the evidence. It was
destroyed. I don't know who destroyed it.

1248
01:16:51,671 --> 01:16:54,663
- I think Gordon did a lot of shredding.
- Hard evidence?

1249
01:16:54,751 --> 01:16:58,664
Well, I can't say that it would positively
prove that they planned the break-in...

1250
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,707
but it would come pretty close.

1251
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:04,188
Can you tell me anything
about who got the money?

1252
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:07,184
We have...

1253
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,908
had some help on this
from a couple of sources...

1254
01:17:11,511 --> 01:17:13,786
and this is a way of confirming it.

1255
01:17:17,231 --> 01:17:19,187
I don't want you to feel
that you're in a position...

1256
01:17:19,271 --> 01:17:21,227
where you have to disclose names.

1257
01:17:21,431 --> 01:17:23,626
I can just ask you initials...

1258
01:17:24,231 --> 01:17:27,189
and then that way you're not
divulging any information.

1259
01:17:28,151 --> 01:17:30,745
We have some idea.
Would that be all right?

1260
01:17:35,591 --> 01:17:36,944
Was there an "M"?

1261
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:41,862
Can you just nod either way?

1262
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:44,983
Did it go that high up?

1263
01:17:48,911 --> 01:17:49,980
"L"?

1264
01:17:52,031 --> 01:17:53,828
I don't want to say any more, okay?

1265
01:17:53,911 --> 01:17:56,106
I'm sorry. You said "L"...

1266
01:17:56,871 --> 01:17:58,350
or... I get confused.

1267
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,629
Could we just go back for a second?

1268
01:18:01,031 --> 01:18:03,340
In one six-day period,
over $6 million came in.

1269
01:18:03,431 --> 01:18:05,387
You wouldn't believe what was
going on inside that woman.

1270
01:18:05,471 --> 01:18:06,790
The stuff was just ready to pour out.

1271
01:18:06,871 --> 01:18:09,021
I'm pouring down cups of coffee
trying to get it out of her...

1272
01:18:09,111 --> 01:18:10,305
before she throws me out of the house.

1273
01:18:10,391 --> 01:18:12,109
- Give me your notes so...
- These are the notes.

1274
01:18:12,191 --> 01:18:14,386
- These are the notes?
- I've got stuff on napkins, matchbooks...

1275
01:18:14,471 --> 01:18:16,541
I'm writing in the bathroom
while she's getting coffee.

1276
01:18:16,631 --> 01:18:18,349
- I'm a walking litter basket!
- You're crazy.

1277
01:18:18,431 --> 01:18:20,899
You'd be crazy, too, if you were
operating on 20 cups of coffee.

1278
01:18:20,991 --> 01:18:22,663
Could you give me
something I can get down?

1279
01:18:22,751 --> 01:18:23,979
I got it. I got it all.

1280
01:18:24,071 --> 01:18:25,424
Okay. Write.

1281
01:18:25,591 --> 01:18:27,866
- Mitchell was in control.
- Wait a minute.

1282
01:18:28,591 --> 01:18:30,502
- There were men working under Mitchell...
- How many?

1283
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:32,661
I don't know how many, but the
men working under Mitchell...

1284
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:34,343
received the money from the slush fund.

1285
01:18:34,431 --> 01:18:35,864
Do we know how much money?

1286
01:18:35,951 --> 01:18:38,021
We're talking about hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

1287
01:18:38,111 --> 01:18:40,750
And these men are the key to
what that money was used for.

1288
01:18:40,831 --> 01:18:42,230
Boy, that woman was paranoid.

1289
01:18:42,311 --> 01:18:45,030
At one point, I suddenly wondered
how high up this thing goes...

1290
01:18:45,111 --> 01:18:46,590
and her paranoia finally got to me.

1291
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:48,946
I thought what we had was so
hot, that any minute CBS or NBC...

1292
01:18:49,031 --> 01:18:50,862
would come in through the
windows and take the story away.

1293
01:18:50,951 --> 01:18:51,986
You're both paranoid.

1294
01:18:52,071 --> 01:18:54,380
She's afraid of John Mitchell,
you're afraid of Walter Cronkite.

1295
01:18:54,471 --> 01:18:56,507
- Right.
- Can we go back to what she said?

1296
01:18:57,871 --> 01:18:59,862
Here. "L," "P," and "M."

1297
01:19:01,231 --> 01:19:02,903
- What do you mean?
- It's "L," "P," and "M".

1298
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:04,743
- She'd only give initials.
- Initials?

1299
01:19:04,831 --> 01:19:08,107
The initials are the name of the men that
worked under Mitchell. "L," "P," and "M."

1300
01:19:08,191 --> 01:19:09,943
You couldn't get the names?

1301
01:19:11,271 --> 01:19:13,262
If I could've gotten the names,
I would've gotten the names!

1302
01:19:13,351 --> 01:19:14,909
I'm with the woman, trying
to get anything I can.

1303
01:19:14,991 --> 01:19:17,061
She said "L," "P," and "M,"
that's all she would give me...

1304
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:18,823
are the people who
worked under Mitchell.

1305
01:19:18,911 --> 01:19:21,550
She said something about
Mitchell. She hates him.

1306
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:22,984
<i>She said, "John Mitchell...</i>

1307
01:19:23,071 --> 01:19:25,346
"If you guys could get John Mitchell,
that would be beautiful".

1308
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:27,820
Wait a minute, what's this here?
What are you writing about Sloan?

1309
01:19:27,911 --> 01:19:29,867
"Sloan was the treasurer of
the Committee to Re-Elect.

1310
01:19:29,951 --> 01:19:32,465
"His wife is pregnant and she made
Sloan quit because apparently...

1311
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:34,064
"he no longer wanted
to be a part of it".

1312
01:19:34,151 --> 01:19:35,266
We've got to go see Sloan.

1313
01:19:35,351 --> 01:19:37,706
Okay. Make a note of
it. So, what have we got?

1314
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:39,019
Where's that matchbook?

1315
01:19:39,111 --> 01:19:40,226
- Here.
- "L," "P," and "M."

1316
01:19:40,311 --> 01:19:41,539
Okay, "L," "P," and "M."

1317
01:19:41,631 --> 01:19:44,270
- "L" could be La Rue. It could be Liddy.
- "L" is Liddy.

1318
01:19:44,351 --> 01:19:46,182
- How do we know that?
- Because she said it.

1319
01:19:46,271 --> 01:19:48,626
Right here. She said, "At
the time of the break-in...

1320
01:19:48,711 --> 01:19:50,349
"there was so much
money floating around...

1321
01:19:50,431 --> 01:19:51,784
"that I know Gordon got part of it".

1322
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:53,827
So I said, "You mean Gordon Liddy?"
She said, "Yes".

1323
01:19:53,911 --> 01:19:56,106
So, "L" is Liddy. Okay,
that leaves "P" and "M."

1324
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:57,670
"P" could be...

1325
01:19:58,311 --> 01:20:01,508
Parkinson. It could be
Porter. It could be...

1326
01:20:01,591 --> 01:20:04,503
Wait a minute! There was a guy once.
There was a guy we talked to last week.

1327
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:06,229
Didn't he say that there
was a Bart Porter...

1328
01:20:06,311 --> 01:20:08,222
who at one time was a member
of the Committee to Re-Elect?

1329
01:20:08,311 --> 01:20:10,188
Porter was called before
the Grand Jury investigation.

1330
01:20:10,271 --> 01:20:11,784
So "P" is definitely Porter.

1331
01:20:11,871 --> 01:20:13,099
"P" could be Porter.

1332
01:20:13,191 --> 01:20:16,103
"P" is Porter, "L" is Liddy.
All that leaves is "M"!

1333
01:20:16,631 --> 01:20:19,020
"M" could be McCord? That's out.

1334
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:21,382
It could be Mardian.

1335
01:20:22,111 --> 01:20:23,305
It could be...

1336
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:25,590
- Magruder!
- I think it's Magruder.

1337
01:20:25,671 --> 01:20:27,821
- I think it's Magruder, too.
- Why do you think it's Magruder?

1338
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:29,424
Because he was second in
command under Mitchell.

1339
01:20:29,511 --> 01:20:30,580
Why do you think it's Magruder?

1340
01:20:30,671 --> 01:20:32,946
Because at one time he
was a temporary head...

1341
01:20:33,031 --> 01:20:34,987
of the Committee to
Re-Elect, before Mitchell.

1342
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:36,106
I don't want a cookie.

1343
01:20:36,191 --> 01:20:38,227
We've got to get that bookkeeper
to say it was Magruder.

1344
01:20:38,311 --> 01:20:39,630
Never get her to say anything about "M."

1345
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:42,225
We have got to go back there
and try to get her to say it.

1346
01:20:42,711 --> 01:20:45,430
If we could make names
of the initials...

1347
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:47,821
then we'll know the people at
CREEP who paid off the burglars.

1348
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:50,471
We'll at least know who got the money.

1349
01:20:52,111 --> 01:20:54,864
The indictments that came down
from the Grand Jury today...

1350
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:56,100
stopped...

1351
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:59,219
with the five burglars, Hunt and Liddy.

1352
01:20:59,471 --> 01:21:01,701
Carl, we have got to go back
there and get that bookkeeper...

1353
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:03,588
to say who the names
are and not initials.

1354
01:21:03,671 --> 01:21:04,899
She ain't going to give it to you...

1355
01:21:04,991 --> 01:21:06,344
because I was with the
woman for six hours.

1356
01:21:06,431 --> 01:21:08,626
- We have to try.
- Then you'll have to trick her, threaten her.

1357
01:21:08,711 --> 01:21:10,349
- She's not going to do it.
- Wait a minute.

1358
01:21:10,431 --> 01:21:12,467
- You know what we could do?
- What?

1359
01:21:15,231 --> 01:21:17,540
- Listen, we go back there...
- Yeah.

1360
01:21:18,111 --> 01:21:20,261
...and you ask her who "P" is.
- Yeah.

1361
01:21:20,351 --> 01:21:21,989
And then I say, "No,
don't worry about it...

1362
01:21:22,071 --> 01:21:23,584
"we know 'P' is Porter".
I just bury it.

1363
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,787
Okay. Now, wait a minute.
I say to her, "Who is 'P'?"

1364
01:21:25,871 --> 01:21:28,704
- And then you say to me...
- I say, "No, we know 'P' is Porter".

1365
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:30,463
- You mean, you try to fake her out?
- Right.

1366
01:21:30,551 --> 01:21:33,065
- And what if she denies it?
- We're screwed.

1367
01:21:33,151 --> 01:21:35,062
- So?
- But if she doesn't, we know we got it.

1368
01:21:35,151 --> 01:21:37,346
- We know "P" is Porter.
- Try it.

1369
01:21:46,391 --> 01:21:47,426
Hi.

1370
01:21:47,551 --> 01:21:49,064
They'll see you.

1371
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:51,986
Not if you let us in, they won't.

1372
01:21:52,071 --> 01:21:53,584
And I'm Bob Woodward.

1373
01:21:53,671 --> 01:21:56,822
- They'll see your car.
- We parked around the corner.

1374
01:21:57,711 --> 01:22:00,145
You have answers for
everything, don't you?

1375
01:22:00,471 --> 01:22:02,666
If we did, we wouldn't be here.

1376
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:05,985
You wrote what I told you.

1377
01:22:06,071 --> 01:22:08,027
Oh, no. Not your name.
No one knows it was you.

1378
01:22:08,111 --> 01:22:10,227
Could you tell us who got the money?

1379
01:22:10,831 --> 01:22:12,264
And how much?

1380
01:22:13,191 --> 01:22:16,308
You mean like, "What did you
do with the $25,000, lady?"

1381
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:17,706
What?

1382
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:21,423
Little jokes they're making
down at Finance these days.

1383
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:23,750
If people are to be convinced...

1384
01:22:23,831 --> 01:22:26,789
that Stans and Sloan are innocent,
then our reporting must be precise...

1385
01:22:26,871 --> 01:22:28,429
and you can help us.

1386
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:29,546
Who is "P"?

1387
01:22:29,631 --> 01:22:32,350
"P" we know, is Porter.
You said, "$25,000."

1388
01:22:32,751 --> 01:22:34,787
Is that how much Porter got?

1389
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:39,870
Was it more?

1390
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,662
Was it more than $50,000?

1391
01:22:50,191 --> 01:22:52,910
Was Magruder the only
"M" to receive money?

1392
01:23:00,191 --> 01:23:02,147
Who told you about Porter?

1393
01:23:03,911 --> 01:23:08,223
<i>I'd like to move on now to the subject
of the break-in at the Watergate...</i>

1394
01:23:08,471 --> 01:23:10,780
<i>and the controversies that
keep coming up out of that.</i>

1395
01:23:10,871 --> 01:23:13,943
<i>It has recently, very recently
been reported now, that...</i>

1396
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,623
<i>some documents were torn up...</i>

1397
01:23:15,711 --> 01:23:18,020
<i>at the Committee to
Re-Elect the President.</i>

1398
01:23:18,111 --> 01:23:21,262
<i>Are you investigating the
tearing up of those documents...</i>

1399
01:23:21,351 --> 01:23:23,945
<i>Well, I think that came out in
a story in the Washington Post.</i>

1400
01:23:24,031 --> 01:23:25,908
<i>- Yes.
- I think the investigation...</i>

1401
01:23:25,991 --> 01:23:27,709
<i>that has just concluded itself...</i>

1402
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:29,986
<i>has probably been one
of the most intensive...</i>

1403
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:33,666
<i>that the Department of Justice and
the FBI has ever been involved in.</i>

1404
01:23:33,751 --> 01:23:35,787
<i>Some 1,500 persons were interviewed...</i>

1405
01:23:35,871 --> 01:23:40,023
<i>1,800 leads were followed,
333 agents were involved...</i>

1406
01:23:40,111 --> 01:23:41,749
<i>14,000 man-hours...</i>

1407
01:23:42,231 --> 01:23:45,541
<i>fifty-one of the 59 FBI
field officers were involved.</i>

1408
01:23:47,151 --> 01:23:49,267
<i>And that, I think...</i>

1409
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:52,749
<i>is a great credit to
justice in this country.</i>

1410
01:23:52,831 --> 01:23:54,901
<i>Did you know that documents
had been destroyed?</i>

1411
01:23:54,991 --> 01:23:56,060
<i>No, I did not.</i>

1412
01:23:58,831 --> 01:24:02,187
All these neat little houses and
all these nice little streets.

1413
01:24:02,711 --> 01:24:06,863
It's hard to believe that something's
wrong in some of those little houses.

1414
01:24:07,311 --> 01:24:08,710
No, it isn't.

1415
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:12,347
- Hello, I'm Carl Bernstein.
- Bob Woodward.

1416
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:15,423
We'd just like to talk to Mr.
Sloan for a couple of minutes.

1417
01:24:15,511 --> 01:24:18,344
- He's resting right now.
- Are you Mrs. Sloan?

1418
01:24:19,751 --> 01:24:22,709
<i>- You're the two from the Post, aren't you?
- Yes.</i>

1419
01:24:23,311 --> 01:24:24,790
This is an honest house.

1420
01:24:24,871 --> 01:24:27,544
That's why we'd like
to see your husband.

1421
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:29,941
Faced with certain criminal
charges that might be brought...

1422
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:32,101
against some people that are
innocent, we just feel that...

1423
01:24:32,191 --> 01:24:34,022
It's really for his benefit.

1424
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:35,510
No, it's not.

1425
01:24:38,831 --> 01:24:41,061
No, it's not.

1426
01:24:41,311 --> 01:24:43,905
Deborah, tell them to come in.

1427
01:24:44,231 --> 01:24:45,300
Thanks.

1428
01:24:45,391 --> 01:24:47,780
- Hi, Carl Bernstein.
- How do you do? Hugh Sloan.

1429
01:24:47,871 --> 01:24:49,190
- Bob Woodward.
- How are you doing?

1430
01:24:49,271 --> 01:24:51,705
I appreciate you giving us the time.

1431
01:24:58,471 --> 01:25:00,621
You know, the reason that
we're here, basically...

1432
01:25:00,711 --> 01:25:02,463
is that we've talked
to certain people who...

1433
01:25:02,551 --> 01:25:04,587
have indicated that the reason
you left the Committee...

1434
01:25:04,671 --> 01:25:07,026
was because you no longer
want to be part of it.

1435
01:25:07,111 --> 01:25:09,067
Yeah, right. Maybe there's
a legitimate explanation...

1436
01:25:09,151 --> 01:25:12,268
why the money was handed to
Liddy and Mitchell's aides.

1437
01:25:15,351 --> 01:25:17,182
Try to understand this.

1438
01:25:18,511 --> 01:25:20,627
- I'm a Republican.
- I am, too.

1439
01:25:20,911 --> 01:25:22,947
Well, I believe in Richard Nixon.

1440
01:25:23,031 --> 01:25:25,909
I worked in the White House for
four years and so did my wife.

1441
01:25:25,991 --> 01:25:29,984
What happened on June 17, I don't
think the President knew anything about.

1442
01:25:30,351 --> 01:25:32,660
Is it possible that some of
his people might have known?

1443
01:25:32,751 --> 01:25:33,786
I'm not sure about that.

1444
01:25:33,871 --> 01:25:35,827
Do you think the truth will
ever come out at the trial?

1445
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:37,788
- That's another thing I'm not sure about.
- Why?

1446
01:25:37,871 --> 01:25:40,339
Well, obviously, because certain
people lied to the prosecutor.

1447
01:25:40,431 --> 01:25:42,581
No. We were never told
flat out, "Don't talk!"

1448
01:25:42,671 --> 01:25:44,423
But the message was clear, though.

1449
01:25:44,511 --> 01:25:47,423
In other words, by their very
silence, there was a cover-up.

1450
01:25:47,511 --> 01:25:50,184
Well, they didn't urge us to
come forward and tell the truth.

1451
01:25:50,271 --> 01:25:52,227
"They," meaning the White House?

1452
01:25:52,311 --> 01:25:54,427
Well, the Committee's not
an independent operation.

1453
01:25:54,511 --> 01:25:56,422
Everything's cleared
with the White House.

1454
01:25:56,511 --> 01:25:59,583
And I don't think the FBI or
the prosecutors understand that.

1455
01:25:59,671 --> 01:26:01,548
That report on the cash...

1456
01:26:02,431 --> 01:26:06,106
in the CREEP safe, that $350,000?

1457
01:26:06,191 --> 01:26:08,580
- No, more.
- Was that a correct figure?

1458
01:26:08,671 --> 01:26:10,866
No, it was closer to $1,000,000.

1459
01:26:12,271 --> 01:26:14,831
And, as treasurer, you
could release those funds?

1460
01:26:14,911 --> 01:26:16,424
When so ordered.

1461
01:26:16,711 --> 01:26:19,066
We don't know the names of
the people who could order you.

1462
01:26:19,151 --> 01:26:21,267
- We just know that there were four.
- No, there were five.

1463
01:26:21,351 --> 01:26:24,070
Mitchell, Stans,
Magruder, they're obvious.

1464
01:26:24,911 --> 01:26:28,108
- There had to be a White House overseer.
- Yeah, Colson.

1465
01:26:28,351 --> 01:26:32,105
No, Colson's too smart to get involved
directly with anything like that.

1466
01:26:33,071 --> 01:26:34,504
It's Haldeman.

1467
01:26:36,711 --> 01:26:37,826
Right?

1468
01:26:39,311 --> 01:26:40,983
I won't talk about the other two.

1469
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:42,868
They both worked at the White House?

1470
01:26:42,951 --> 01:26:46,421
One of them did, the other one's not
in Washington. But that's all I'll say.

1471
01:26:46,511 --> 01:26:48,627
- Kalmbach.
- Nixon's personal lawyer.

1472
01:26:48,951 --> 01:26:50,862
- Right?
- Nixon's personal lawyer?

1473
01:26:50,951 --> 01:26:53,181
I can't say anything. I'm sorry.

1474
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:56,981
<i>- Well...
- When's the baby due?</i>

1475
01:26:59,311 --> 01:27:00,903
Soon. Next month.

1476
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:04,264
- Are you going to stay here?
- No, I don't think so.

1477
01:27:04,351 --> 01:27:06,148
Decided where you're gonna go?

1478
01:27:06,231 --> 01:27:09,667
<i>I've been looking for a job in
the private sector, but it's...</i>

1479
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:12,949
It's very hard. My name's
been in the papers too much.

1480
01:27:14,351 --> 01:27:17,741
You know, one thing I'm just
still not completely clear about?

1481
01:27:18,991 --> 01:27:22,028
When you handed out the money,
how did that work, exactly?

1482
01:27:22,111 --> 01:27:23,260
Badly.

1483
01:27:26,751 --> 01:27:30,744
I think what Bob means is, that
ordinarily, what was the procedure?

1484
01:27:31,031 --> 01:27:34,262
Routine. I'd call John Mitchell
over at the Justice Department.

1485
01:27:34,351 --> 01:27:35,909
He'd say, "Go ahead,
give out the money".

1486
01:27:35,991 --> 01:27:37,982
This was all done verbally?

1487
01:27:38,911 --> 01:27:39,946
Yes.

1488
01:27:40,831 --> 01:27:43,220
Okay, we know there were five
men who controlled the slush fund.

1489
01:27:43,311 --> 01:27:44,380
Mitchell, Stans, and Magruder.

1490
01:27:44,471 --> 01:27:47,304
Yeah, those three we've got. And all
three have been named by two sources.

1491
01:27:47,391 --> 01:27:49,029
What about the other two?

1492
01:27:49,471 --> 01:27:51,382
- Kalmbach.
- We're pretty sure of Kalmbach.

1493
01:27:51,711 --> 01:27:54,384
Maybe we better wait
until we get all five, huh?

1494
01:27:54,471 --> 01:27:55,620
Certain on Mitchell?

1495
01:27:55,711 --> 01:27:58,828
We know that he approved payments to
Liddy while he was Attorney General.

1496
01:27:58,911 --> 01:28:00,583
- You've got more than one source?
- Yes, Harry.

1497
01:28:00,671 --> 01:28:01,706
- Who are they?
- Sloan.

1498
01:28:01,791 --> 01:28:02,826
Sloan and who else?

1499
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:04,822
There's another guy at Justice
who so far won't confirm...

1500
01:28:04,911 --> 01:28:07,220
the names of the others who control
the fund. We're working on it.

1501
01:28:07,311 --> 01:28:09,222
- What about Deep Throat?
- He's not a source on this.

1502
01:28:09,311 --> 01:28:10,585
- But do any of them have an axe?
- No.

1503
01:28:10,671 --> 01:28:12,389
Personal, political, sexual.

1504
01:28:12,471 --> 01:28:13,984
- Is there anything at all on Mitchell?
- No.

1505
01:28:14,071 --> 01:28:15,424
- Then can we use their names?
- No.

1506
01:28:15,511 --> 01:28:19,470
God damn it! When is somebody gonna
go on the record in this story?

1507
01:28:22,031 --> 01:28:25,103
You guys are about to write a story
that says the former Attorney General...

1508
01:28:25,191 --> 01:28:28,900
the highest ranking law enforcement
officer in this country is a crook!

1509
01:28:32,031 --> 01:28:33,987
Just be sure you're right.

1510
01:28:36,831 --> 01:28:39,629
<i>- Essex House, may I help you?
- John Mitchell.</i>

1511
01:28:47,391 --> 01:28:48,426
<i>Yes?</i>

1512
01:28:49,231 --> 01:28:51,620
<i>Sir, this is Carl Bernstein
of the Washington Post...</i>

1513
01:28:51,711 --> 01:28:54,020
and I'm sorry to
disturb you at this hour.

1514
01:28:54,111 --> 01:28:57,706
Tomorrow we're running
a story in the paper...

1515
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:01,181
and we just think that you should
have a chance to comment on it.

1516
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:03,945
<i>What does it say?</i>

1517
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:06,980
"John N. Mitchell, while serving...

1518
01:29:07,071 --> 01:29:10,029
"as United States Attorney General...

1519
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:12,466
"personally controlled
a secret cash fund...

1520
01:29:12,551 --> 01:29:14,906
"that was used to gather
information about the Democrats...

1521
01:29:14,991 --> 01:29:16,185
<i>- "according to"...
- Jesus.</i>

1522
01:29:16,271 --> 01:29:18,262
"...sources involved in
the Watergate investigation".

1523
01:29:18,351 --> 01:29:21,229
<i>- Jesus.
- "Beginning in the spring of 1971...</i>

1524
01:29:21,311 --> 01:29:23,381
"almost a year before he
left the Justice Department...

1525
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:25,826
"to become President
Nixon's campaign manager...

1526
01:29:25,911 --> 01:29:29,984
"on March 1, Mitchell personally
approved withdrawals from the fund".

1527
01:29:30,071 --> 01:29:32,505
<i>All that crap. You're
putting it in the paper?</i>

1528
01:29:32,591 --> 01:29:34,661
<i>- Well...
- It's all been denied.</i>

1529
01:29:35,311 --> 01:29:37,222
<i>You tell your publisher,
tell Katie Graham...</i>

1530
01:29:37,311 --> 01:29:40,428
<i>she's going to get her tit caught in
the big ringer if that's published.</i>

1531
01:29:40,511 --> 01:29:43,071
<i>Christ, that's the most
sickening thing I ever heard.</i>

1532
01:29:43,151 --> 01:29:45,346
Sir, I was just wondering if
I could ask you some questions?

1533
01:29:45,431 --> 01:29:47,740
<i>- What time is it?
- It's 11:30, sir.</i>

1534
01:29:48,311 --> 01:29:51,144
<i>11:30? Is it morning or night?</i>

1535
01:29:51,231 --> 01:29:53,108
It's 11:30 at night, sir.

1536
01:29:54,711 --> 01:29:58,863
Sir, the Committee to Re-Elect has
issued a statement to our story...

1537
01:29:58,951 --> 01:30:00,543
but there are just a
couple of questions...

1538
01:30:00,631 --> 01:30:03,429
<i>Did the Committee tell you to
go ahead and publish the story?</i>

1539
01:30:03,511 --> 01:30:05,945
<i>You fellows have got
a great ballgame going.</i>

1540
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:09,387
<i>As soon as you're done, we're
going to do a story on all of you.</i>

1541
01:30:09,471 --> 01:30:11,223
Sir, there's just a
couple of questions...

1542
01:30:11,311 --> 01:30:13,381
<i>Call my law office in the morning.</i>

1543
01:30:16,031 --> 01:30:18,545
There's no question you
properly identified yourself?

1544
01:30:18,631 --> 01:30:20,747
He said it right off the top.

1545
01:30:21,631 --> 01:30:23,462
Mitchell know he was
talking to a reporter?

1546
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:25,781
Yeah, but I think I woke him up.

1547
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:28,187
- Get good notes?
- Verbatim.

1548
01:30:29,871 --> 01:30:32,431
He really said that about Mrs. Graham?

1549
01:30:33,951 --> 01:30:35,782
Well, I'd cut the words
"her tit" and print it.

1550
01:30:35,871 --> 01:30:36,906
Why?

1551
01:30:36,991 --> 01:30:38,982
This is a family newspaper.

1552
01:30:42,231 --> 01:30:43,630
You know, once when I was reporting...

1553
01:30:43,711 --> 01:30:46,179
Lyndon Johnson's top
guy gave me the word.

1554
01:30:46,711 --> 01:30:49,703
They were looking for a
successor for J. Edgar Hoover.

1555
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:53,386
I wrote it and the day it appeared,
Johnson held a press conference...

1556
01:30:53,471 --> 01:30:56,349
and appointed Hoover
head of the FBI for life.

1557
01:30:56,831 --> 01:30:59,470
When he was done, he
turned to his top guy...

1558
01:30:59,551 --> 01:31:03,066
and the President said,
"Call Ben Bradlee and tell him, 'Fuck you' ".

1559
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:05,866
Then everybody said, "You
did it, Ben. You screwed up.

1560
01:31:05,951 --> 01:31:08,340
"You stuck us with Hoover forever".

1561
01:31:09,351 --> 01:31:11,911
I screwed up, but I wasn't wrong.

1562
01:31:15,711 --> 01:31:18,430
How much can you tell
me about Deep Throat?

1563
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:21,507
How much do you need to know?

1564
01:31:21,591 --> 01:31:23,149
Do you trust him?

1565
01:31:24,751 --> 01:31:25,786
Yeah.

1566
01:31:27,951 --> 01:31:32,342
I can't do the reporting for my reporters
which means I have to trust them.

1567
01:31:33,951 --> 01:31:35,987
And I hate trusting anybody.

1568
01:31:43,991 --> 01:31:45,470
Run that, baby.

1569
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:27,464
<i>The Washington Post reported that while
still in office as Attorney General...</i>

1570
01:32:27,551 --> 01:32:31,544
<i>John Mitchell had personally
controlled a secret Republican fund.</i>

1571
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:35,459
<i>Mitchell denied any such involvement
and called the story ludicrous.</i>

1572
01:32:35,831 --> 01:32:38,982
<i>The new charge also brought a
response from Vice President Agnew...</i>

1573
01:32:39,071 --> 01:32:40,390
<i>at his stop in Tampa.</i>

1574
01:32:40,471 --> 01:32:43,144
<i>I have full confidence
in Mr. Mitchell...</i>

1575
01:32:43,951 --> 01:32:46,988
<i>and in the people in the
Republican organization.</i>

1576
01:32:47,071 --> 01:32:50,825
<i>And I think that that kind
of unattributed report...</i>

1577
01:32:50,911 --> 01:32:53,584
<i>at a time like this
is counterproductive.</i>

1578
01:32:53,751 --> 01:32:57,346
<i>We must bear in mind that
those who published it...</i>

1579
01:32:58,231 --> 01:33:01,303
<i>have already shown their
sympathy for the other ticket.</i>

1580
01:33:01,391 --> 01:33:02,983
<i>A band and some young cheerleaders...</i>

1581
01:33:03,071 --> 01:33:04,424
All non-denial denials.

1582
01:33:04,511 --> 01:33:07,150
They doubt our ancestry, but they
don't say the story isn't accurate.

1583
01:33:07,231 --> 01:33:09,187
I mean, did you understand
one thing he was saying?

1584
01:33:09,271 --> 01:33:12,343
What I can't figure out
is, what is a real denial?

1585
01:33:12,471 --> 01:33:16,464
Well, if they start calling us goddamn
liars, we better start circling the wagons.

1586
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,343
When do you think
they'll start doing that?

1587
01:33:18,431 --> 01:33:19,910
When they get out of Tampa.

1588
01:33:21,151 --> 01:33:23,745
Joe, come on. What's going
on with you guys at the FBI?

1589
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:25,389
I've been trying to
get to you for weeks.

1590
01:33:25,471 --> 01:33:26,745
Your secretary says you're not in.

1591
01:33:26,831 --> 01:33:28,822
Last night I called, you
said you couldn't talk...

1592
01:33:28,911 --> 01:33:31,471
and this morning, as soon as our
Mitchell story hits the stands...

1593
01:33:31,551 --> 01:33:33,826
you call me and say you've
got to see me right away. Why?

1594
01:33:33,911 --> 01:33:36,425
Look, you guys have been causing
big trouble at the Bureau.

1595
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:37,546
Why?

1596
01:33:37,911 --> 01:33:41,221
Our reports are showing up
in your paper almost verbatim.

1597
01:33:41,311 --> 01:33:44,860
I mean, you've really been on
the mark, except for Mitchell.

1598
01:33:44,951 --> 01:33:46,987
Now, we didn't have that...

1599
01:33:47,351 --> 01:33:49,865
- that he controlled the funds.
- Right.

1600
01:33:50,031 --> 01:33:51,783
Our agents have been busting ass...

1601
01:33:51,871 --> 01:33:54,180
but we're gonna go back now and
see if we've missed anything.

1602
01:33:54,271 --> 01:33:55,943
What I don't understand
is all the people...

1603
01:33:56,031 --> 01:33:58,022
who might know details of
the bugging operation...

1604
01:33:58,111 --> 01:33:59,669
the FBI hasn't even talked to.

1605
01:33:59,751 --> 01:34:02,140
And why have you conducted your
interviews of CREEP personnel...

1606
01:34:02,231 --> 01:34:03,346
at CREEP headquarters...

1607
01:34:03,431 --> 01:34:06,343
instead of at their homes where
they might feel freer to talk?

1608
01:34:06,431 --> 01:34:07,580
Joe, wait a minute.

1609
01:34:07,671 --> 01:34:10,344
Why have the interviews at
CREEP always been conducted...

1610
01:34:10,431 --> 01:34:12,945
within the presence of the
lawyer who works for CREEP?

1611
01:34:13,031 --> 01:34:15,909
Look, you know I can't
answer for the whole Bureau.

1612
01:34:15,991 --> 01:34:18,789
- Oh, come on, I'm just...
- I do what I'm told.

1613
01:34:19,991 --> 01:34:22,107
I followed my orders. Period.

1614
01:34:28,071 --> 01:34:29,390
What orders?

1615
01:34:33,391 --> 01:34:35,302
Wait. Woodward!

1616
01:34:37,831 --> 01:34:38,866
Wait!

1617
01:34:40,151 --> 01:34:41,186
Bob!

1618
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:46,220
Out of the blue. Out of the blue.

1619
01:34:48,311 --> 01:34:51,428
Okay, this morning I get a tip to call
a guy by the name of Alex Shipley...

1620
01:34:51,511 --> 01:34:53,900
who is now the Assistant
Attorney General of Tennessee.

1621
01:34:53,991 --> 01:34:56,459
<i>Now, the guy told me, that
called me, that said...</i>

1622
01:34:56,551 --> 01:34:59,111
He said that Shipley was
asked in the summer of 1971...

1623
01:34:59,191 --> 01:35:01,500
by an old army buddy,
a Donald Segretti...

1624
01:35:01,591 --> 01:35:03,388
to join a group of other lawyers...

1625
01:35:03,471 --> 01:35:05,826
for Nixon's campaign to sabotage
the Democratic candidates.

1626
01:35:05,911 --> 01:35:07,822
Listen, make a left when you
can. We'll go to my place.

1627
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:08,980
Sabotage Democratic candidates?

1628
01:35:09,071 --> 01:35:11,426
That's right. Now, I was able to
make a couple of calls today...

1629
01:35:11,551 --> 01:35:13,303
<i>and I got Segretti's
records for the year...</i>

1630
01:35:13,391 --> 01:35:16,224
His travel records for the years 1971
- '72.

1631
01:35:16,751 --> 01:35:17,820
<i>Does the FBI know about...</i>

1632
01:35:17,911 --> 01:35:19,105
- Did you say left or right?
- Left!

1633
01:35:19,191 --> 01:35:21,466
We're going to my place. We
gotta go over the records.

1634
01:35:21,551 --> 01:35:24,224
- Does the FBI know about Segretti?
- The FBI interrogated Segretti...

1635
01:35:24,311 --> 01:35:26,905
and found out he wasn't involved
in the break-in so they dropped it.

1636
01:35:26,991 --> 01:35:28,026
They didn't follow through on it.

1637
01:35:28,111 --> 01:35:29,180
- Where is he?
- He's in California.

1638
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,029
- Jesus, look at this.
- What?

1639
01:35:32,111 --> 01:35:35,501
Segretti crisscrossed the
country at least a dozen times.

1640
01:35:37,071 --> 01:35:39,744
He only stayed in cities where
there were Democratic primaries.

1641
01:35:39,831 --> 01:35:43,107
Well, if the break-in is just one
incident in a campaign of sabotage...

1642
01:35:43,191 --> 01:35:44,749
that began a whole
year before Watergate...

1643
01:35:44,831 --> 01:35:46,708
then for the first time,
the break-in makes sense.

1644
01:35:46,791 --> 01:35:47,906
This isn't so crazy.

1645
01:35:47,991 --> 01:35:50,221
This thing didn't start with
the bugging at the headquarters.

1646
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:52,302
Segretti was doing this
a year before the bugging.

1647
01:35:52,391 --> 01:35:54,109
And a year before, Nixon
wasn't slaughtering Muskie.

1648
01:35:54,191 --> 01:35:57,740
He was running behind Muskie,
before Muskie self-destructed.

1649
01:35:58,151 --> 01:35:59,903
If he self-destructed.

1650
01:36:00,951 --> 01:36:03,340
- Hi. Donald Segretti?
- That's right.

1651
01:36:03,631 --> 01:36:06,429
<i>I'm Carl Bernstein from
the Washington Post.</i>

1652
01:36:06,951 --> 01:36:07,986
Hi.

1653
01:36:08,791 --> 01:36:10,509
What can I do for you?

1654
01:36:10,591 --> 01:36:14,903
Well, my paper just sent me out here to
try to persuade you to go on the record.

1655
01:36:15,151 --> 01:36:16,186
Why me?

1656
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:18,307
I guess because you were
the head coordinator...

1657
01:36:18,391 --> 01:36:21,747
of Nixon's sabotage campaign
against the Democrats.

1658
01:36:22,951 --> 01:36:25,863
- Carl, you want some coffee?
- You read my mind.

1659
01:36:31,471 --> 01:36:33,348
Carl, tell me something.

1660
01:36:34,271 --> 01:36:36,739
What do you imagine the
head coordinator does?

1661
01:36:36,831 --> 01:36:40,540
Well, I guess basically you're involved
in recruiting other people like yourself...

1662
01:36:40,631 --> 01:36:41,666
other lawyers.

1663
01:36:41,751 --> 01:36:44,311
- Lawyers?
- Like Alex Shipley.

1664
01:36:45,311 --> 01:36:49,099
I made it clear that I would not
do anything violent or illegal.

1665
01:36:49,351 --> 01:36:51,421
What do you mean by illegal?

1666
01:36:51,911 --> 01:36:55,426
<i>Watergate, I mean, that's... The
whole bugging. That's horrendous!</i>

1667
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:58,021
And what kind of stuff
do you guys do then?

1668
01:36:58,111 --> 01:36:59,908
Nickel-and-dime
stuff.

1669
01:37:01,031 --> 01:37:04,262
Stuff. Stuff with a
little wit attached to it.

1670
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:06,467
You mean, when you sent out
on Muskie's stationery that...

1671
01:37:06,551 --> 01:37:09,702
Senator Hubert Humphrey was
going out with call girls?

1672
01:37:10,111 --> 01:37:12,750
Listen, if anything, it
helped the man's image.

1673
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:15,868
What was the one on Muskie's
stationery that you sent out...

1674
01:37:15,951 --> 01:37:19,307
that said that Scoop Jackson
was having a bastard child?

1675
01:37:19,711 --> 01:37:22,942
So, sometimes it got up to
a quarter. Off the record.

1676
01:37:23,471 --> 01:37:27,225
I think one of the most interesting
ones was the Canuck letter.

1677
01:37:28,151 --> 01:37:29,584
What about it?

1678
01:37:30,271 --> 01:37:33,661
Come on. Where you claimed that
Muskie slurred the Canadians.

1679
01:37:33,831 --> 01:37:35,708
No, I didn't write that.

1680
01:37:36,031 --> 01:37:37,180
Do you know who did?

1681
01:37:37,271 --> 01:37:40,422
Carl, when you guys print it
in the papers, then I'll know.

1682
01:37:40,511 --> 01:37:42,103
Smart guy, Donald.

1683
01:37:42,791 --> 01:37:44,349
You're no dummy.

1684
01:37:45,191 --> 01:37:46,863
I'm a lawyer, Carl.

1685
01:37:47,431 --> 01:37:49,820
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer...

1686
01:37:50,391 --> 01:37:54,066
and I'll probably wind up going
to jail and being disbarred...

1687
01:37:54,711 --> 01:37:58,829
and I don't know what I did
that was so goddamn awful.

1688
01:38:04,311 --> 01:38:07,223
I'll tell you something.
None of this was my idea.

1689
01:38:07,311 --> 01:38:09,108
I didn't go looking for the job.

1690
01:38:09,191 --> 01:38:11,022
Well, that's important.

1691
01:38:12,151 --> 01:38:13,823
Chapin came to you.

1692
01:38:20,391 --> 01:38:21,426
You know what?

1693
01:38:21,511 --> 01:38:25,345
It's funny, but I keep forgetting that
you guys knew each other in college.

1694
01:38:25,431 --> 01:38:28,946
You were friends at SC, you
and Chapin. Who else was there?

1695
01:38:29,351 --> 01:38:30,830
There was me...

1696
01:38:31,591 --> 01:38:32,706
Dwight...

1697
01:38:33,191 --> 01:38:34,419
Ziegler...

1698
01:38:34,591 --> 01:38:36,070
all the USC mafia.

1699
01:38:36,231 --> 01:38:39,064
And that's when you got involved
in meaningless student elections...

1700
01:38:39,151 --> 01:38:43,064
<i>when you start to try to get your man
in so you stuffed ballot boxes and...</i>

1701
01:38:43,151 --> 01:38:46,507
What's that term you guys use
for screwing up the opposition?

1702
01:38:46,631 --> 01:38:49,020
- Rat-fucking.
- That's right.

1703
01:38:49,111 --> 01:38:50,829
You were just doing the
same kind of stuff...

1704
01:38:50,911 --> 01:38:53,550
when you were out campaigning
for President Nixon.

1705
01:38:53,631 --> 01:38:57,260
Let me tell you something, we did
a lot of worse things in college.

1706
01:38:58,311 --> 01:39:00,506
Look, let me ask you something, Carl.

1707
01:39:00,871 --> 01:39:03,431
What would you have done if you
were just getting out of the army...

1708
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:05,547
been away from the real
world for four years...

1709
01:39:05,631 --> 01:39:08,782
didn't know what kind of
law you wanted to practice...

1710
01:39:08,871 --> 01:39:11,339
and one day you get a
call from an old friend...

1711
01:39:11,431 --> 01:39:15,185
asking if you want to go to work for
the President of the United States?

1712
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:19,341
Chapin was the appointment
secretary for Nixon when he called.

1713
01:39:19,431 --> 01:39:22,389
Yeah. Listen, if those sinister
things really happened...

1714
01:39:22,471 --> 01:39:24,223
I don't think Dwight
knew anything about them.

1715
01:39:24,311 --> 01:39:25,790
He just did what he was told.

1716
01:39:25,871 --> 01:39:27,224
Told by who?

1717
01:39:37,991 --> 01:39:40,107
What's the topic for tonight?

1718
01:39:45,071 --> 01:39:46,424
Rat-fucking.

1719
01:39:48,431 --> 01:39:51,503
In my day it was simply
known as the double-cross.

1720
01:39:52,351 --> 01:39:54,307
In our present context...

1721
01:39:55,991 --> 01:39:58,630
it means infiltration of the Democrats.

1722
01:40:00,471 --> 01:40:02,780
Segretti won't go on the record...

1723
01:40:02,991 --> 01:40:06,142
but if he would, we know
he would implicate Chapin.

1724
01:40:07,591 --> 01:40:10,469
And that would put you
inside the White House.

1725
01:40:11,271 --> 01:40:12,306
Who?

1726
01:40:14,591 --> 01:40:15,910
Be specific.

1727
01:40:16,991 --> 01:40:18,344
How high up?

1728
01:40:21,511 --> 01:40:24,230
You'll have to find
that out for yourself.

1729
01:40:25,671 --> 01:40:27,548
I don't like newspapers.

1730
01:40:29,511 --> 01:40:32,230
I don't care for inexactitude...

1731
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:34,669
and shallowness.

1732
01:40:35,991 --> 01:40:39,063
The CREEP slush fund that
financed the rat-fucking...

1733
01:40:39,151 --> 01:40:41,346
we've just about got that
nailed down. I don't know how...

1734
01:40:41,431 --> 01:40:43,103
Did you change cabs?

1735
01:40:50,031 --> 01:40:51,066
Yeah.

1736
01:40:51,751 --> 01:40:53,981
Does the FBI know what we know?

1737
01:40:57,991 --> 01:40:59,424
Does Justice?

1738
01:41:03,471 --> 01:41:05,666
Why haven't they done anything?

1739
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:10,589
If it didn't deal directly with
the break-in, they didn't pursue.

1740
01:41:11,671 --> 01:41:13,389
Who told them not to?

1741
01:41:13,711 --> 01:41:16,305
Don't you understand what you're on to?

1742
01:41:19,711 --> 01:41:22,623
- Mitchell knew?
- Of course Mitchell knew.

1743
01:41:23,511 --> 01:41:26,150
Do you think something
this size just happens?

1744
01:41:26,231 --> 01:41:27,983
Haldeman had to know, too.

1745
01:41:28,071 --> 01:41:30,744
You'll get nothing
from me about Haldeman.

1746
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:36,030
Segretti said that...

1747
01:41:36,111 --> 01:41:39,421
Don't concentrate on Segretti.
You'll miss the overall.

1748
01:41:41,631 --> 01:41:44,941
The letter that destroyed
the Muskie candidacy...

1749
01:41:45,031 --> 01:41:47,101
the Canuck letter, did that
come from inside the White...

1750
01:41:47,191 --> 01:41:48,909
You're missing the overall.

1751
01:41:49,071 --> 01:41:50,345
But what overall?

1752
01:41:50,431 --> 01:41:53,582
They were frightened of Muskie,
and look who got destroyed.

1753
01:41:53,671 --> 01:41:57,380
They wanted to run against McGovern.
Look who they're running against.

1754
01:41:57,511 --> 01:42:00,389
They bugged, they followed people...

1755
01:42:00,871 --> 01:42:03,101
false press leaks, fake letters.

1756
01:42:03,751 --> 01:42:06,106
They canceled Democratic
campaign rallies.

1757
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:09,183
They investigated
Democratic private lives.

1758
01:42:09,831 --> 01:42:12,709
They planted spies, stole
documents, and on and on.

1759
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:17,023
Now, don't tell me you think this is
all the work of little Don Segretti.

1760
01:42:19,271 --> 01:42:21,387
The FBI and Justice know this?

1761
01:44:46,191 --> 01:44:47,340
- Carl?
- Yeah.

1762
01:44:47,431 --> 01:44:49,342
Why don't you pick up
your messages more often?

1763
01:44:49,431 --> 01:44:51,183
- Right. You got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

1764
01:44:51,391 --> 01:44:52,540
Who's Pete Teller?

1765
01:44:52,631 --> 01:44:55,828
I haven't the slightest idea, Carl. I
have this whole place to take care of.

1766
01:44:55,911 --> 01:44:57,503
- Carl?
- Yeah, one second.

1767
01:44:59,151 --> 01:45:01,949
Tell him to leave his phone number
next time, all right? Hi, Sally.

1768
01:45:02,031 --> 01:45:03,862
Listen, do you guys know
about the Canuck letter?

1769
01:45:03,951 --> 01:45:05,066
Yep. I'm sorry, I'm late.

1770
01:45:05,151 --> 01:45:07,824
I just wanted to make
sure you knew who wrote it.

1771
01:45:08,871 --> 01:45:11,180
What?

1772
01:45:11,391 --> 01:45:13,507
You mean the letter that
sabotaged the Muskie candidacy?

1773
01:45:13,591 --> 01:45:15,183
All right, come here.

1774
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:17,307
When did he tell you this?

1775
01:45:20,311 --> 01:45:22,222
Gotta tell Bob.

1776
01:45:25,351 --> 01:45:26,943
- Woodward.
- What?

1777
01:45:27,791 --> 01:45:30,100
<i>One second. Very important... Come here.</i>

1778
01:45:31,471 --> 01:45:33,427
Tell him what you told me.

1779
01:45:34,471 --> 01:45:35,950
Here, sit down.

1780
01:45:37,751 --> 01:45:41,027
Just exactly the way you
said it to me, say it to him.

1781
01:45:41,591 --> 01:45:43,821
Ken Clawson told me he
wrote the Canuck letter.

1782
01:45:43,911 --> 01:45:45,742
The letter that said Muskie
was slurring the Canadians.

1783
01:45:45,831 --> 01:45:46,866
Clawson?

1784
01:45:46,951 --> 01:45:49,829
The Deputy Director of White House
Communications wrote the Canuck letter.

1785
01:45:49,911 --> 01:45:51,947
- When did he tell you this?
- When we were having drinks.

1786
01:45:52,031 --> 01:45:53,828
- Where were you?
- My apartment.

1787
01:45:53,911 --> 01:45:55,902
- When did you say he told you?
- Two weeks ago.

1788
01:45:55,991 --> 01:45:58,459
What else did he say?
He didn't say anything?

1789
01:45:58,551 --> 01:45:59,586
Come on, you're hedging.

1790
01:45:59,671 --> 01:46:02,231
You think he said it to impress you
to get you to go to bed with him?

1791
01:46:02,311 --> 01:46:04,142
- Jesus.
- No, I want to hear her say it.

1792
01:46:04,231 --> 01:46:07,428
Do you think he said that to impress
you, try to get you to go to bed with him?

1793
01:46:07,511 --> 01:46:10,787
Why did it take you two
weeks to tell us this, Sally?

1794
01:46:12,031 --> 01:46:15,660
I guess I don't have the taste
for the jugular you guys have.

1795
01:46:18,711 --> 01:46:20,429
You're claiming it was
all a misunderstanding?

1796
01:46:20,511 --> 01:46:22,661
<i>Absolutely. Sally's got it all wrong.</i>

1797
01:46:22,751 --> 01:46:24,707
<i>I never told her that
I wrote that letter.</i>

1798
01:46:24,791 --> 01:46:26,782
<i>We were just shooting the
breeze about the election.</i>

1799
01:46:26,871 --> 01:46:28,065
She's an awfully good reporter.

1800
01:46:28,151 --> 01:46:30,301
I don't remember her getting
that much wrong before, do you?

1801
01:46:30,391 --> 01:46:32,666
<i>Look, that's a real
bullshit question, Woodward.</i>

1802
01:46:32,751 --> 01:46:35,424
<i>That is a question straight
out of Wichita, Kansas.</i>

1803
01:46:35,511 --> 01:46:36,910
Listen. One last thing.

1804
01:46:36,991 --> 01:46:39,869
Do you remember where this
shooting the breeze took place?

1805
01:46:39,951 --> 01:46:41,828
<i>What do you mean, where?</i>

1806
01:46:42,071 --> 01:46:44,426
I mean, was it a restaurant,
or her apartment, or a bar?

1807
01:46:44,511 --> 01:46:46,467
<i>Now, look. I'd forgotten
the entire incident...</i>

1808
01:46:46,551 --> 01:46:48,587
<i>but it most certainly
wasn't in her apartment.</i>

1809
01:46:48,671 --> 01:46:52,107
<i>- Do you remember when it took place?
- I don't have time for this. I'm a busy man.</i>

1810
01:46:52,191 --> 01:46:53,226
Did you get all that?

1811
01:46:53,311 --> 01:46:55,222
What did he say about meeting
in a bar or restaurant?

1812
01:46:55,311 --> 01:46:56,664
He said he forgot the entire incident.

1813
01:46:56,751 --> 01:46:59,106
- That means he didn't deny it.
- That's a non-denial denial.

1814
01:46:59,191 --> 01:47:00,590
Wichita, Kansas?

1815
01:47:00,671 --> 01:47:02,662
Yeah, he said that's a
bullshit question, Woodward...

1816
01:47:02,751 --> 01:47:04,867
I know what he said. But
I'm from Wheaton, Illinois.

1817
01:47:04,951 --> 01:47:06,464
Hey, Bob, Carl. He's on the phone.

1818
01:47:06,551 --> 01:47:07,984
- Who?
- Clawson.

1819
01:47:11,711 --> 01:47:15,340
Get over there on line 4 and
transcribe this, will you? Four.

1820
01:47:16,071 --> 01:47:17,663
- Four?
- Okay. Yeah.

1821
01:47:19,151 --> 01:47:20,220
Yes, Ken.

1822
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:23,542
<i>Sally, for Christ's sakes, don't
tell them I came to your place.</i>

1823
01:47:23,631 --> 01:47:25,986
Why not? What's wrong with
coming over for a drink?

1824
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:28,460
<i>You and me? In your apartment?</i>

1825
01:47:29,271 --> 01:47:30,306
Well?

1826
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:33,420
<i>Jesus Christ, you just shot me down.</i>

1827
01:47:33,511 --> 01:47:37,106
<i>If that appears in the papers that
I'm over at your house, having...</i>

1828
01:47:37,831 --> 01:47:40,550
<i>- Do you know what that does?
- No, I don't see why.</i>

1829
01:47:40,631 --> 01:47:42,587
<i>You don't? You don't?</i>

1830
01:47:43,671 --> 01:47:46,822
<i>- There's nothing bad about it.
- Well, there sure is.</i>

1831
01:47:48,951 --> 01:47:50,828
<i>This is just incredible.</i>

1832
01:47:51,551 --> 01:47:53,189
Well, I have a clear conscience.

1833
01:47:53,271 --> 01:47:56,263
<i>Sally, I have a wife, and a
family, and a dog, and a cat.</i>

1834
01:47:57,671 --> 01:47:59,502
She said that he was in
her house having drinks.

1835
01:47:59,591 --> 01:48:02,628
Now, look, I don't care where it
happened. What happened is what counts.

1836
01:48:02,711 --> 01:48:05,748
When we asked him about it, he
said he forgot the entire incident.

1837
01:48:06,071 --> 01:48:08,266
<i>- Yeah?
- Ken Clawson on the line.</i>

1838
01:48:08,431 --> 01:48:10,661
- Ken Clawson on the line.
- Jesus.

1839
01:48:13,551 --> 01:48:15,269
Ken. What's up, kid?

1840
01:48:15,351 --> 01:48:18,070
<i>Ben, now, look, this whole thing
that's going on over there, Ben...</i>

1841
01:48:18,151 --> 01:48:21,029
<i>I want you to know that I never
claimed authorship of the Canuck letter!</i>

1842
01:48:21,111 --> 01:48:22,510
Says he never wrote the letter.

1843
01:48:22,591 --> 01:48:25,389
<i>It's some kind of misunderstanding,
a confusion, I want you to know...</i>

1844
01:48:25,471 --> 01:48:28,349
Slow down, Ken. You sound frazzled.

1845
01:48:28,431 --> 01:48:29,830
<i>Now, Ben, please, listen.</i>

1846
01:48:29,911 --> 01:48:33,301
<i>If you're going to refer to that
alleged conversation with Sally Aiken...</i>

1847
01:48:33,391 --> 01:48:35,700
<i>you can't print that it
took place in her apartment.</i>

1848
01:48:35,791 --> 01:48:38,430
<i>I have a wife, and a
family, and a dog, and a cat.</i>

1849
01:48:38,511 --> 01:48:40,706
"A wife, and a family,
and a dog, and a cat".

1850
01:48:40,791 --> 01:48:42,782
Right, Ken, right. Yeah.

1851
01:48:42,871 --> 01:48:46,102
Now, Ken, I don't want to print
that you were in Sally's apartment.

1852
01:48:46,191 --> 01:48:47,226
<i>Thank God.</i>

1853
01:48:47,311 --> 01:48:50,621
I just want to know what you
said in Sally's apartment.

1854
01:49:03,031 --> 01:49:04,430
<i>- Hello.
- Bernstein...</i>

1855
01:49:04,511 --> 01:49:07,821
<i>I just got a tip from our FBI source.
The secret cash fund financed Segretti.</i>

1856
01:49:07,911 --> 01:49:09,549
<i>- Jesus.
- All right. Now, listen.</i>

1857
01:49:09,631 --> 01:49:12,941
<i>Chapin hired Segretti, we know that.
And we know Haldeman hired Chapin.</i>

1858
01:49:13,031 --> 01:49:15,545
<i>Haldeman has to be the fifth
name to control the fund.</i>

1859
01:49:16,431 --> 01:49:17,830
Sloan knows.

1860
01:49:20,071 --> 01:49:22,266
We've only got four out of the
five who controlled the fund.

1861
01:49:22,351 --> 01:49:23,625
It has to be Haldeman.

1862
01:49:23,711 --> 01:49:25,702
I don't think we've got it.

1863
01:49:26,191 --> 01:49:28,068
We know the fifth is a
top White House official.

1864
01:49:28,151 --> 01:49:30,062
But no one has said it.
No one has named Haldeman.

1865
01:49:30,151 --> 01:49:33,860
- No one's denied it.
- That still doesn't prove it was Haldeman.

1866
01:49:35,631 --> 01:49:37,826
If you go to bed at night and
there's no snow on the ground...

1867
01:49:37,911 --> 01:49:39,549
when you wake up and
there's snow on the ground...

1868
01:49:39,631 --> 01:49:42,145
you can say it snowed during the
night, although you didn't see it.

1869
01:49:42,231 --> 01:49:44,540
But if we can't prove the fifth
man is Haldeman, we're wiped out.

1870
01:49:44,631 --> 01:49:46,587
Everything in that campaign
is done with his approval.

1871
01:49:46,671 --> 01:49:48,548
We know that everybody
who works under Haldeman...

1872
01:49:48,631 --> 01:49:50,462
does so with his knowledge.

1873
01:49:50,551 --> 01:49:52,507
And everybody is under
Haldeman, except the President.

1874
01:49:52,591 --> 01:49:54,821
Common sense says it's Haldeman.

1875
01:49:57,071 --> 01:49:58,948
If we go and see Sloan...

1876
01:49:59,031 --> 01:50:03,263
<i>and we tell him that we know that he
named Haldeman to the Grand Jury...</i>

1877
01:50:04,671 --> 01:50:07,310
Then all we would need to
do is have him confirm it.

1878
01:50:07,391 --> 01:50:08,506
Right.

1879
01:50:09,031 --> 01:50:11,147
- Want to do it that way?
- Yes.

1880
01:50:12,191 --> 01:50:14,227
Let's go back and see Sloan.

1881
01:50:17,551 --> 01:50:19,542
We can't go now 'cause
he's not home yet.

1882
01:50:20,271 --> 01:50:23,024
He may not be answering,
but he might be there.

1883
01:50:37,231 --> 01:50:38,300
- Hi.
- Please.

1884
01:50:38,391 --> 01:50:41,064
Listen, we've already written the
story. We just need you to define...

1885
01:50:41,151 --> 01:50:43,028
Deborah's in the hospital
and my in-laws are coming...

1886
01:50:43,111 --> 01:50:44,749
- Two questions?
- We understand.

1887
01:50:44,831 --> 01:50:46,264
Two questions?

1888
01:50:49,471 --> 01:50:51,860
The cash that financed
the Watergate break-in...

1889
01:50:51,951 --> 01:50:53,589
five men had control of the fund.

1890
01:50:53,671 --> 01:50:56,549
Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach.
We have confirmations on those four.

1891
01:50:56,631 --> 01:50:59,304
- We just found out Haldeman's the fifth.
- I'm not your source on that.

1892
01:50:59,391 --> 01:51:02,110
We're not asking you to be our source.
All we're asking is to confirm it.

1893
01:51:02,191 --> 01:51:03,306
I'm not your source on Haldeman.

1894
01:51:03,391 --> 01:51:05,347
Okay, look, when you were
questioned by the Grand Jury...

1895
01:51:05,431 --> 01:51:06,466
You had to name names.

1896
01:51:06,551 --> 01:51:09,987
<i>- Of course, everything they asked, yes.
- Lf they asked you. All right if they...</i>

1897
01:51:12,671 --> 01:51:15,185
<i>I don't know... Say we wrote a
story that said that Haldeman...</i>

1898
01:51:15,271 --> 01:51:16,989
was the fifth name to control the fund.

1899
01:51:17,071 --> 01:51:20,063
- Would we be in any trouble?
- Would we be wrong?

1900
01:51:23,431 --> 01:51:25,262
Let me put it this way.

1901
01:51:25,591 --> 01:51:28,663
I would have no problems if
you wrote a story like that.

1902
01:51:28,751 --> 01:51:30,343
- You wouldn't?
- No.

1903
01:51:32,111 --> 01:51:34,022
- That's okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

1904
01:51:34,511 --> 01:51:36,706
- Oh, you had a baby.
- Yes, my wife did.

1905
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:38,110
- Little boy or girl?
- That's terrific.

1906
01:51:38,191 --> 01:51:39,226
It's a girl.

1907
01:51:39,311 --> 01:51:40,983
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1908
01:51:41,071 --> 01:51:42,789
- We're sorry to bother you.
- Yeah.

1909
01:51:42,871 --> 01:51:45,465
- Will you give our best to her?
- I will.

1910
01:51:48,431 --> 01:51:51,662
Well, I think that, Woodward,
and I am curious of the fact...

1911
01:51:51,751 --> 01:51:54,629
<i>that the FBI, in its entire
inquiry, never talked to the...</i>

1912
01:51:54,711 --> 01:51:57,828
Or did any inquiries into the second
most-powerful man to the President.

1913
01:51:57,911 --> 01:51:59,469
<i>You don't seem to understand.</i>

1914
01:51:59,551 --> 01:52:02,019
<i>No, you get nothing
about Haldeman out of me.</i>

1915
01:52:02,311 --> 01:52:04,063
But we don't need to know anything, Joe.

1916
01:52:04,151 --> 01:52:06,221
Tomorrow we're going
with a story on the FBI.

1917
01:52:06,311 --> 01:52:07,346
<i>Now, what does that mean?</i>

1918
01:52:07,431 --> 01:52:09,308
And we're going to
establish in that story...

1919
01:52:09,391 --> 01:52:11,700
that you guys just about
blew the whole investigation.

1920
01:52:11,791 --> 01:52:13,509
<i>Oh, no, we didn't miss so much.</i>

1921
01:52:13,591 --> 01:52:15,502
You didn't know Haldeman had
control of the slush fund?

1922
01:52:15,591 --> 01:52:17,263
<i>Oh, yes, we did. It's all in our files.</i>

1923
01:52:17,351 --> 01:52:19,581
<i>- Not about Haldeman.
- Yeah, Haldeman. John Haldeman.</i>

1924
01:52:19,671 --> 01:52:23,107
<i>Look, now, look, I'm very busy.
I've got to go put the kids to bed.</i>

1925
01:52:24,871 --> 01:52:27,305
That's the confirmation right there.

1926
01:52:28,431 --> 01:52:30,786
Wait a minute, wait a
sec. Did he say John?

1927
01:52:31,311 --> 01:52:33,347
- He said Haldeman.
- He said John Haldeman.

1928
01:52:33,431 --> 01:52:35,820
What the hell difference does it
make if he said Isaiah or David?

1929
01:52:35,911 --> 01:52:36,980
There's only one Haldeman.

1930
01:52:37,071 --> 01:52:40,381
Yeah, well, Isaiah or David
aren't assistants to the President.

1931
01:52:40,871 --> 01:52:42,668
I don't know, it still feels thin.

1932
01:52:42,751 --> 01:52:44,707
Christ, I just wish we
knew if we could print this.

1933
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:46,827
Now wait a minute, we didn't
make them do these things...

1934
01:52:46,911 --> 01:52:48,310
but once they did, they're fair game!

1935
01:52:48,391 --> 01:52:50,586
Harry, let's go over your
sources again. I want to hear it.

1936
01:52:50,671 --> 01:52:53,663
Sloan told the Grand Jury. He
answered everything they asked him.

1937
01:52:53,751 --> 01:52:55,582
That means there's gotta
be a record somewhere.

1938
01:52:55,671 --> 01:52:58,663
He told the Grand Jury, the FBI
confirms. What more do you need?

1939
01:52:58,751 --> 01:52:59,866
I happen to love this country.

1940
01:52:59,951 --> 01:53:02,021
You know, we're not a bunch
of zanies out to bring it down!

1941
01:53:02,111 --> 01:53:03,749
Harry, weren't you
arguing the opposite way?

1942
01:53:03,831 --> 01:53:05,310
No, not at all.

1943
01:53:05,471 --> 01:53:06,506
All right, now hold it.

1944
01:53:06,591 --> 01:53:08,661
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

1945
01:53:08,871 --> 01:53:11,180
We're about to accuse Haldeman
who only happens to be...

1946
01:53:11,271 --> 01:53:13,102
the second-most-important
man in this country...

1947
01:53:13,191 --> 01:53:15,864
of conducting a criminal conspiracy
from inside the White House.

1948
01:53:15,951 --> 01:53:17,623
It would be nice if we were right.

1949
01:53:17,711 --> 01:53:19,588
- Have you double-checked
your sources? - Jesus.

1950
01:53:19,671 --> 01:53:22,344
- Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
- Absolutely!

1951
01:53:22,431 --> 01:53:24,103
- Woodward?
- I'm sure.

1952
01:53:24,671 --> 01:53:26,946
I'm not. It still seems thin.

1953
01:53:27,231 --> 01:53:28,505
Get another source.

1954
01:53:28,591 --> 01:53:31,583
How many fucking sources
do they think we've got?

1955
01:53:34,871 --> 01:53:38,147
- Are you sure Deep Throat won't confirm?
- He won't confirm, I told you that.

1956
01:53:38,231 --> 01:53:39,425
What about the guy in Justice?

1957
01:53:39,511 --> 01:53:41,422
You can't call him. He's
right next to the Grand Jury.

1958
01:53:41,511 --> 01:53:43,820
- We have no choice. It's trouble.
- It's 20 minutes to deadline.

1959
01:53:43,911 --> 01:53:46,630
I don't even know if I
can get him on the phone.

1960
01:54:01,031 --> 01:54:03,386
<i>- Dr. Kissinger's office.
- Deputy General's office, please.</i>

1961
01:54:08,031 --> 01:54:09,749
Do you know when you expect him back?

1962
01:54:09,831 --> 01:54:11,742
<i>No, sir. I believe he's
left for the evening.</i>

1963
01:54:11,831 --> 01:54:15,187
<i>If you'd like to leave a message...
Oh, could you hold, please?</i>

1964
01:54:15,271 --> 01:54:17,546
Hi, this is Carl. I'm
sorry to disturb you now...

1965
01:54:17,631 --> 01:54:20,020
but we're going with the story
that Haldeman was the fifth man...

1966
01:54:20,111 --> 01:54:21,988
in control of the fund and
they're hassling us here.

1967
01:54:22,071 --> 01:54:24,631
We've got three confirmations. If
you could help us, I'd appreciate it.

1968
01:54:24,711 --> 01:54:26,383
<i>I won't say anything
about Haldeman. Not ever.</i>

1969
01:54:26,471 --> 01:54:27,984
I understand. We wouldn't
want you to do that.

1970
01:54:28,071 --> 01:54:29,982
We know it's against the
law for you to say anything.

1971
01:54:30,071 --> 01:54:32,983
If there's a way you could warn us to
hold on the story, we'd appreciate it.

1972
01:54:33,071 --> 01:54:34,948
<i>I'd really like to
help you, but I can't.</i>

1973
01:54:35,031 --> 01:54:37,386
Look, I'm going to
count to 10, all right?

1974
01:54:37,471 --> 01:54:39,427
If there's any reason we
should hold on the story...

1975
01:54:39,511 --> 01:54:41,024
hang up the phone before I get to 10.

1976
01:54:41,111 --> 01:54:44,626
If the story's all right, you just be on
the phone after I get to 10, all right?

1977
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:46,508
<i>- Hang up, right?
- That's right.</i>

1978
01:54:46,591 --> 01:54:47,865
<i>- You got it?
- Yeah.</i>

1979
01:54:47,951 --> 01:54:50,624
We're straight. All right, I'm
going to start counting, okay?

1980
01:54:50,711 --> 01:54:51,905
<i>- We all right?
- Yeah.</i>

1981
01:54:51,991 --> 01:54:53,140
Okay, I'm counting.

1982
01:54:53,231 --> 01:54:55,301
One, two...

1983
01:54:55,831 --> 01:54:58,868
three, four, five...

1984
01:54:59,511 --> 01:55:01,502
six, seven...

1985
01:55:02,751 --> 01:55:06,460
eight, nine, ten.

1986
01:55:08,271 --> 01:55:10,944
<i>You got it straight
now? Everything okay?</i>

1987
01:55:11,591 --> 01:55:13,229
Everything's fine.

1988
01:55:16,671 --> 01:55:17,865
Woodward!

1989
01:55:22,751 --> 01:55:24,025
We got it.

1990
01:55:26,311 --> 01:55:27,505
- He confirmed.
- What happened?

1991
01:55:27,591 --> 01:55:30,105
I said if I get up to 10 and
you don't hang up, it's solid.

1992
01:55:30,191 --> 01:55:31,340
- Did he confirm it?
- Absolutely.

1993
01:55:31,431 --> 01:55:33,387
We've got to tell Bradlee!

1994
01:55:41,671 --> 01:55:45,186
Bernstein got another source.
The guy at Justice confirmed.

1995
01:55:45,351 --> 01:55:47,023
If there's any doubt,
we can run it tomorrow.

1996
01:55:47,111 --> 01:55:49,102
You don't have to. The story's
solid. We're sure of it.

1997
01:55:49,191 --> 01:55:52,069
I just got off the phone
with him. It's gold.

1998
01:55:53,191 --> 01:55:54,943
Okay, we go with it.

1999
01:56:07,591 --> 01:56:08,865
Woodstein!

2000
01:56:23,711 --> 01:56:25,827
- You know what it's about?
- No.

2001
01:56:26,631 --> 01:56:28,542
<i>Sloan, who resigned as
campaign treasurer...</i>

2002
01:56:28,631 --> 01:56:30,269
<i>after the Watergate break-in...</i>

2003
01:56:30,351 --> 01:56:32,911
<i>showed up for a deposition
in the common-cause suit on...</i>

2004
01:56:32,991 --> 01:56:36,666
<i>disclosure of campaign contributions,
and denied naming Haldeman.</i>

2005
01:56:36,751 --> 01:56:39,504
<i>Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment
on testimony before the Grand Jury?</i>

2006
01:56:39,591 --> 01:56:41,263
<i>I'd like my attorney
to answer that question.</i>

2007
01:56:41,351 --> 01:56:43,421
<i>Gentlemen, the answer
is an unequivocal "no".</i>

2008
01:56:43,511 --> 01:56:46,708
<i>Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr.
Haldeman in that testimony at all.</i>

2009
01:56:46,791 --> 01:56:48,702
<i>It is in his testimony that
Mr. Sloan acknowledged...</i>

2010
01:56:48,791 --> 01:56:50,622
<i>- that it was an espionage fund?
- No, not at all.</i>

2011
01:56:50,711 --> 01:56:52,702
<i>Did he mention any use of
funds for espionage activity?</i>

2012
01:56:52,791 --> 01:56:54,702
<i>None, whatsoever. Thank
you, gentlemen. Thank you.</i>

2013
01:56:54,791 --> 01:56:57,863
<i>Sloan expanded his denial to
include his statements to the FBI...</i>

2014
01:56:57,951 --> 01:57:00,909
<i>and to all federal authorities. A
short time later at the White House...</i>

2015
01:57:00,991 --> 01:57:03,585
<i>News Secretary Ronald Ziegler
delivered a strong attack...</i>

2016
01:57:03,671 --> 01:57:05,389
<i>on the Washington Post.</i>

2017
01:57:05,471 --> 01:57:08,747
<i>Why is the Post trying to
do it? You have a man...</i>

2018
01:57:09,791 --> 01:57:13,022
<i>who is the editor of the Washington
Post by the name of Ben Bradlee.</i>

2019
01:57:13,111 --> 01:57:16,467
<i>I think anyone who would
want to honestly assess...</i>

2020
01:57:16,551 --> 01:57:19,429
<i>what his political
persuasions are, would...</i>

2021
01:57:19,511 --> 01:57:21,979
<i>I think come to the
conclusion, quite quickly...</i>

2022
01:57:22,071 --> 01:57:24,744
<i>that he is not a supporter
of President Nixon.</i>

2023
01:57:24,831 --> 01:57:26,389
<i>I respect the free press.</i>

2024
01:57:26,471 --> 01:57:29,304
<i>I don't respect the
type of journalism...</i>

2025
01:57:29,831 --> 01:57:33,619
<i>the shabby journalism that is being
practiced by the Washington Post.</i>

2026
01:57:33,711 --> 01:57:36,623
<i>All I know is that the story
that ran this morning...</i>

2027
01:57:37,391 --> 01:57:39,666
<i>is incorrect and it's been so...</i>

2028
01:57:40,551 --> 01:57:42,667
<i>stated as being incorrect...</i>

2029
01:57:43,111 --> 01:57:45,705
<i>by not only me, but by the individual...</i>

2030
01:57:45,991 --> 01:57:48,824
<i>whose Grand Jury, secret
Grand Jury testimony...</i>

2031
01:57:48,911 --> 01:57:50,583
<i>they based their story on.</i>

2032
01:57:50,671 --> 01:57:54,220
<i>And that individual has denied
that he ever so testified.</i>

2033
01:57:54,911 --> 01:57:57,823
<i>No sooner had Ziegler finished, than
the President's campaign manager...</i>

2034
01:57:57,911 --> 01:57:59,708
<i>Clark MacGregor, met with reporters.</i>

2035
01:57:59,791 --> 01:58:01,349
<i>Using innuendo...</i>

2036
01:58:01,471 --> 01:58:03,268
<i>third-person hearsay...</i>

2037
01:58:03,351 --> 01:58:06,343
<i>unsubstantiated charges,
anonymous sources...</i>

2038
01:58:06,631 --> 01:58:08,667
<i>and huge, scare headlines...</i>

2039
01:58:08,751 --> 01:58:11,743
<i>the Post has maliciously
sought to give the appearance...</i>

2040
01:58:11,831 --> 01:58:14,789
<i>of a direct connection between
the White House and the Watergate.</i>

2041
01:58:14,871 --> 01:58:16,862
<i>A charge which the Post knows...</i>

2042
01:58:16,951 --> 01:58:20,227
<i>and half a dozen investigations
have found to be false.</i>

2043
01:58:20,951 --> 01:58:23,988
<i>The hallmark of the Post
campaign is hypocrisy...</i>

2044
01:58:24,551 --> 01:58:28,544
<i>and its celebrated double standard
is today visible for all to see.</i>

2045
01:58:29,031 --> 01:58:31,226
I'm not talking to you about
Haldeman or anybody else.

2046
01:58:31,311 --> 01:58:32,426
- Then what went wrong?
- Nothing.

2047
01:58:32,511 --> 01:58:33,626
Just tell us what went wrong?

2048
01:58:33,711 --> 01:58:36,544
Didn't you say that the FBI had the
information on Haldeman in the files?

2049
01:58:36,631 --> 01:58:38,030
- No.
- Because we have it in the notes...

2050
01:58:38,111 --> 01:58:40,067
from the conversation we had
on the telephone right here.

2051
01:58:40,151 --> 01:58:42,142
We have to go talk to your
boss if you don't talk to us.

2052
01:58:42,231 --> 01:58:44,950
What the hell are you talking
about? I'll deny everything.

2053
01:58:45,031 --> 01:58:46,623
We're not trying to get
anybody into trouble.

2054
01:58:46,711 --> 01:58:48,667
We're just trying to find
out if we made some errors.

2055
01:58:48,751 --> 01:58:50,662
If we made a mistake, then
we'll come off the story.

2056
01:58:50,751 --> 01:58:54,460
Just tell us if we're wrong.
Tell us if we screwed up.

2057
01:58:54,631 --> 01:58:56,223
I'm not talking about it.

2058
01:58:56,311 --> 01:58:59,383
I am not talking to you about
Haldeman or anybody else.

2059
01:58:59,471 --> 01:59:02,031
In fact, I can't even be seen
talking to either one of you bastards.

2060
01:59:02,111 --> 01:59:05,342
- What are you afraid of? Who got to you?
- Are we being set up?

2061
01:59:06,231 --> 01:59:08,062
- Are we, Joe? Tell us!
- Are we being set up?

2062
01:59:08,151 --> 01:59:10,540
- Just tell us, we won't print it.
- Fuck you.

2063
01:59:10,791 --> 01:59:12,190
And fuck you!

2064
01:59:18,711 --> 01:59:19,860
Honest to God, I just don't know.

2065
01:59:19,951 --> 01:59:21,862
- Oh, I see.
- It's in the notes!

2066
01:59:22,631 --> 01:59:26,306
Yeah, we had another call on a long list
and I've got another call, I've gotta go.

2067
01:59:26,391 --> 01:59:28,700
- Did you mean Bob Haldeman?
- Yeah, Bob Haldeman.

2068
01:59:31,271 --> 01:59:33,341
Jesus, what was our mistake?

2069
01:59:33,671 --> 01:59:35,707
Maybe there was no mistake.

2070
01:59:35,911 --> 01:59:39,870
Then they're just setting us up.
Then the whole thing was a set-up?

2071
01:59:41,271 --> 01:59:43,068
And they just hung us.

2072
01:59:43,791 --> 01:59:46,510
More denunciations. You'll
have to make a statement, Ben.

2073
01:59:46,591 --> 01:59:50,425
One senator just gave a speech
slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.

2074
01:59:50,511 --> 01:59:53,787
I knew we had enemies, but I
didn't know we were this popular.

2075
01:59:54,351 --> 01:59:55,943
Wow, look at this.

2076
01:59:58,311 --> 02:00:00,029
My non-denial denial.

2077
02:00:08,711 --> 02:00:11,020
Fuck it, let's stand by the boys.

2078
02:00:11,631 --> 02:00:13,064
Okay. Foreign?

2079
02:00:14,351 --> 02:00:16,228
All right, here's our headline.

2080
02:00:16,311 --> 02:00:19,701
Radio Hanoi reports the United
States-North Vietnam agreement...

2081
02:00:19,791 --> 02:00:21,861
for a settlement of the Vietnam War.

2082
02:00:29,591 --> 02:00:32,105
<i>Woodward, what did you
find out? What'd he say?</i>

2083
02:00:32,191 --> 02:00:33,306
What time is it?

2084
02:00:33,391 --> 02:00:35,541
<i>- You fell asleep?
- God damn it!</i>

2085
02:01:56,391 --> 02:01:57,665
Over here.

2086
02:02:20,431 --> 02:02:22,262
You let Haldeman slip away.

2087
02:02:22,351 --> 02:02:23,386
Yes.

2088
02:02:23,471 --> 02:02:25,587
You've done worse than
let Haldeman slip away.

2089
02:02:25,671 --> 02:02:29,346
You've got people feeling sorry for
him. I didn't think that was possible.

2090
02:02:29,431 --> 02:02:31,228
In a conspiracy like this...

2091
02:02:31,311 --> 02:02:34,621
you build from the outer
edges and you go step by step.

2092
02:02:34,791 --> 02:02:38,386
If you shoot too high and miss,
everybody feels more secure.

2093
02:02:38,631 --> 02:02:42,180
- You put the investigation back months.
- Yes, we know that.

2094
02:02:42,551 --> 02:02:44,985
And if we're wrong, we're resigning.

2095
02:02:46,311 --> 02:02:47,744
Were we wrong?

2096
02:02:49,791 --> 02:02:51,827
You'll have to find that out, won't you?

2097
02:02:51,911 --> 02:02:54,709
Listen, I'm tired of
your chicken-shit games!

2098
02:02:55,951 --> 02:02:57,623
I don't want hints.

2099
02:02:58,151 --> 02:03:00,221
I need to know what you know.

2100
02:03:15,471 --> 02:03:17,507
It was a Haldeman operation.

2101
02:03:18,951 --> 02:03:22,626
The whole business was run by
Haldeman, the money, everything.

2102
02:03:23,031 --> 02:03:27,104
It won't be easy getting at him. He was
insulated. You'll have to find out how.

2103
02:03:30,791 --> 02:03:33,828
Mitchell started doing covert
stuff before anyone else.

2104
02:03:33,911 --> 02:03:36,709
The list is longer
than anyone can imagine.

2105
02:03:38,951 --> 02:03:42,626
It involves the entire U.S.
Intelligence community...

2106
02:03:44,191 --> 02:03:45,306
FBI...

2107
02:03:46,471 --> 02:03:49,668
CIA, Justice. It's incredible.

2108
02:03:52,431 --> 02:03:54,467
The cover-up had little
to do with Watergate.

2109
02:03:54,551 --> 02:03:57,782
It was mainly to protect
the covert operations.

2110
02:03:59,711 --> 02:04:01,383
It leads everywhere.

2111
02:04:04,391 --> 02:04:06,825
Get out your notebook. There's more.

2112
02:04:12,711 --> 02:04:14,667
Your lives are in danger.

2113
02:04:16,231 --> 02:04:18,699
Hi, I finally got Sloan on the phone.

2114
02:05:35,111 --> 02:05:36,988
Why the hell didn't you
tell me over the phone?

2115
02:05:37,071 --> 02:05:39,107
- Woodward says phones aren't safe.
- Can't trust them.

2116
02:05:39,191 --> 02:05:40,909
- Come on in.
- We can't come in, sir.

2117
02:05:40,991 --> 02:05:43,903
Woodward says there's
electronic surveillance.

2118
02:05:59,911 --> 02:06:01,981
- Surveillance? Who's doing it?
- It's being done.

2119
02:06:02,071 --> 02:06:04,301
People's lives are in
danger. Maybe even ours.

2120
02:06:04,391 --> 02:06:06,109
What happened to that
Justice source of yours?

2121
02:06:06,191 --> 02:06:07,943
I guess I made the
instructions too complicated.

2122
02:06:08,031 --> 02:06:10,306
Because he thought I said "hang up"
when I just said "hang on".

2123
02:06:10,391 --> 02:06:12,302
- Oh, Jesus!
- The story is right.

2124
02:06:12,391 --> 02:06:14,302
Haldeman was the fifth
name to control that fund...

2125
02:06:14,391 --> 02:06:17,349
- and Sloan would've told the Grand Jury.
- Sloan wanted to tell the Jury.

2126
02:06:17,431 --> 02:06:18,784
- Why didn't he?
- Because nobody asked.

2127
02:06:18,871 --> 02:06:20,270
Nobody asked him.

2128
02:06:20,351 --> 02:06:22,103
The cover-up had little
to do with the break-in.

2129
02:06:22,191 --> 02:06:24,625
It was to protect covert operations
and the covert activities...

2130
02:06:24,711 --> 02:06:26,986
involving the entire U.S.
Intelligence community.

2131
02:06:27,071 --> 02:06:29,585
Did Deep Throat say that
people's lives are in danger?

2132
02:06:29,671 --> 02:06:30,706
Yes.

2133
02:06:30,791 --> 02:06:34,340
- What else did he say?
- He said everyone is involved.

2134
02:06:42,031 --> 02:06:44,591
You know the results of
the latest Gallup Poll?

2135
02:06:44,671 --> 02:06:47,390
Half the country never even
heard of the word "Watergate".

2136
02:06:47,471 --> 02:06:49,189
Nobody gives a shit.

2137
02:06:51,711 --> 02:06:54,066
You guys are probably
pretty tired, right?

2138
02:06:54,471 --> 02:06:56,701
You should be. Go on home.

2139
02:06:57,271 --> 02:06:59,990
Get a nice hot bath,
rest up 15 minutes...

2140
02:07:00,391 --> 02:07:02,700
then get your asses back in gear.

2141
02:07:03,151 --> 02:07:06,826
We're under a lot of pressure,
you know, and you put us there.

2142
02:07:08,151 --> 02:07:12,508
Nothing's riding on this except the
First Amendment of the Constitution...

2143
02:07:12,591 --> 02:07:16,061
freedom of the press, and
maybe the future of the country.

2144
02:07:18,031 --> 02:07:20,226
Not that any of that matters...

2145
02:07:20,431 --> 02:07:23,582
but if you guys fuck up
again, I'm going to get mad.

2146
02:07:25,551 --> 02:07:26,825
Goodnight.

2147
02:07:53,591 --> 02:07:55,627
<i>And now, fellow Americans...</i>

2148
02:07:55,911 --> 02:07:59,745
<i>the Honorable Chief Justice will
administer the oath of office...</i>

2149
02:08:00,311 --> 02:08:03,348
<i>to the President of the
United States of America.</i>

2150
02:08:03,431 --> 02:08:05,023
<i>Mr. Chief Justice.</i>

2151
02:08:26,351 --> 02:08:29,980
<i>Mr. President, are you ready
to take the constitutional oath?</i>

2152
02:08:30,191 --> 02:08:34,309
<i>If you will place your left hand on
the Bible and raise your right hand...</i>

2153
02:08:34,391 --> 02:08:38,987
<i>and please repeat after me. "I,
Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear...</i>

2154
02:08:39,111 --> 02:08:41,625
<i>"I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear...</i>

2155
02:08:41,711 --> 02:08:46,068
<i>"...that I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States...</i>

2156
02:08:46,311 --> 02:08:49,940
<i>"...that I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States...</i>

2157
02:08:50,031 --> 02:08:54,468
<i>- "...and will, to the best of my ability...
- "...and will, to the best of my ability...</i>

2158
02:08:54,551 --> 02:08:58,749
<i>"...preserve, protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States...</i>

2159
02:08:58,951 --> 02:09:02,785
<i>"...preserve and protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States...</i>

2160
02:09:02,871 --> 02:09:05,669
<i>- "...so help me, God".
- "...so help me, God".</i>
