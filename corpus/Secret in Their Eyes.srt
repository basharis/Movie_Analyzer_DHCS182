00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:21,019
Help! Help!

3
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,316
- Hey. How are you?
- Happy holidays.

4
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:38,323
You're good.

5
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:41,760
Thank you, sir.

6
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,597
Is that you, angel?

7
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,931
Yeah, it's me.

8
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,567
What brought you back this way?

9
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:50,936
I just... I couldn't stay away from you.

10
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:53,274
- Oh, stop.
- I'm gonna see them upstairs.

11
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:02,982
Ray Kasten. She's expecting me.

12
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:04,182
Go right ahead.

13
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,252
Look who's back.

14
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:09,589
- Could you ask Jessica Cobb to come in, please?
- Mm-hmm.

15
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:11,890
Like a rash.

16
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:16,861
Wow. Thirteen years. Two promotions.

17
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:19,231
- Still an asshole.
- Three promotions.

18
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,099
Thanks for keeping track.

19
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:24,338
What can I say? I'm a fan.

20
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:28,207
You mind?

21
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:32,345
Good luck.

22
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,100
- Am I late?
- Just a bit.

23
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,835
It's good to see you, Ray.

24
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,605
Well, it's...

25
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,241
I see your filing system
hasn't changed much.

26
00:05:02,243 --> 00:05:06,778
The wheels of justice turn
slowly, but they do turn.

27
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,482
And look at you.

28
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,852
Up on the fifth floor.

00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,388

is necessary to protect America.</i>

30
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,127

31
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:24,165
Fax went down again.

32
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
Hello, Al-Fawid.

33
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:31,136
Now be a good little terrorist

34
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:34,806
and just hand over some yellow-cake
uranium in broad daylight,

35
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:36,374
and we're all set.

36
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:37,977
Amen.

37
00:05:39,914 --> 00:05:41,347
Erectile Dysfunction Hotline.

38
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:43,849
How can I direct your call?

39
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:46,018
Not at all. Have a good day.

40
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,119
Attaboy, Bumpy. Give 'em hell.

41
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:50,188
You really are a moron,
Bumpy. You know that?

42
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,958
Siefert, you keep
throwing that term around,

43
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,828
but I'm not sure you know
what it actually means.

44
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,364
- It's a medical term. Did you know that?
- Is that right?

45
00:05:58,366 --> 00:06:01,133
It means someone with
an IQ between 50 and 69.

46
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:04,236
An imbecile is someone with
an IQ between 49 and 20.

47
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:09,174
And an idiot, which I think is the word you're
looking for, is someone who scores below 19.

48
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:11,943
Hmm. What do you call someone
who's dumber than that?

49
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,680
- Lieutenant.
- Lieutenant.

50
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,816
- Where you going?
- I'm wanted in Photo.

51
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:19,818
Chin up. Shoulders back.

52
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:23,989
<i>Pakistani Taliban
are increasingly upping</i>

53
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,058
<i>their fight to cross the border.</i>

54
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,861
<i>This is one of their recent
propaganda videos shot in Afghanistan.</i>

55
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:35,200
<i>In a barbaric act, they
murder a man they claim is an Afghan spy</i>

56
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:36,869
<i>working for NATO.</i>

57
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:38,270
Hi.

58
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,642
Hello.

59
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:44,376
Um, I'm, uh, Ray.

60
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:46,145
Ray Kasten.

61
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:48,047
Claire. Claire Sloan.

62
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:50,816
Okay. It's nice to meet you.

63
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:53,852
Yes. Nice to meet you.

64
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,058
I guess we're the, uh,
new kids at school, huh?

65
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,092
Yep. Today is picture day.

66
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:03,996
Yeah.

67
00:07:03,998 --> 00:07:07,833
That must be why I suddenly feel
like my mom picked out my outfit.

68
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:10,970
Oh.

69
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,508
- Have a great day.
- Thanks.

70
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:21,212
- You're Bureau?
- Yeah. Field office, Lower Manhattan.

71
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:24,319
I was transferred here to sit
on a mosque with the DA's office.

72
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:27,886
You?

73
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:30,388
I just got to the DA's office, from Philly.

74
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,159
I'm second chair of the Homicide unit.

75
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:39,965
Well, that's a pretty stiff rank
to come in with. You must be a star.

76
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,366
No. Hardly.

77
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:46,172
Is this a temporary assignment for you?

78
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,873
I don't know.

79
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,111
I guess that kinda depends
on the guys in the mosque.

80
00:07:54,382 --> 00:07:56,080
Counselor?

81
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:59,453
Oh. Yes. Thank you.

82
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:03,556
- Well, it was nice to meet you.
- Yes.

83
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,857
Uh, Claire, yeah?

84
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:07,592
- Yes.
- I'm Ray. I said that, right?

85
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:09,361
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

86
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,196
- Kasten. Ray Kasten.
- Uh, Ray Kasten, yeah.

87
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:14,165
FBI.

88
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,900
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

89
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:19,205
Give me one second. I just
want to adjust this light.

90
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,743
- Yes.
- A picture's forever, right?

91
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:27,446
Ray Kasten.

92
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:32,618
So, how are you liking Los Angeles?

93
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,823
I'm still just
finding my way around.

94
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:45,767
Okay, now your right
collar, please? Great.

95
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:51,939
Smile.

96
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:56,575
District attorney. My goodness.

97
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,511
It's lawyering.

98
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:03,248
Same as before, only more of it.

99
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,352
You wanna sit down?

100
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:09,153
And from here, where? Mayor?

101
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:12,090
No.

102
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:15,060
No more campaigns for a
while. I'm here, I'm happy.

103
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:17,595
Oh, you thinking of governor already? Wow!

104
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:22,600
Well, I wanted to be head of security for
the Mets, but the position was already filled.

105
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:26,004
And, um, how's Ellis?

106
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:29,207
Fine. Yeah. The same... busy.

107
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:32,346
- Any kids?
- Kids? No.

108
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:37,349
No, never the right time.

109
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,084
What about you?

110
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:40,688
Oh, no. Same.

111
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:46,026
Mind if I close the door?

112
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,463
- Ray?
- Jess.

113
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,768
Jesus! How are you?

114
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:57,970
How are you?

115
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,571
I'm good. I'm good. You?

116
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:04,409
Oh, I'm... I'm fine. I'm f...

117
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:06,045
I was just congratulating Cl...

118
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:08,580
Well, you made chief investigator, right?

119
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:10,215
So I'm...

120
00:10:10,217 --> 00:10:13,384
I'm looking at royalty here.

121
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:15,053
You still living in Moorpark?

122
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:16,488
Yes.

123
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,524
It's quiet out there. I like the quiet.

124
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:21,093
You still Bureau?

125
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:23,965
No. No, I went private sector.

126
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:27,901
Badge kinda lost its charm for me.

127
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:35,040
- I'll let you two...
- No, no, no. Stay.

128
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:36,542
Please.

129
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,913
This is about you.

130
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:43,083
I found him, Jess.

131
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:47,186
I found Marzin.

132
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:17,316
- All right. Here you go.
- Thank you.

133
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,452
Psst.

134
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:23,790
You could just ask her out, you know.

135
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:28,061
Who said I wanted to ask her out?

136
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:41,105
Christ. An unrequited office romance.

137
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:43,777
- The cliché of it doesn't bother you?
- Jess.

138
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:48,413
Uh, have a little respect. She's engaged.

139
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,782
You know? This is...

140
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:52,786
It's inappropriate.

141
00:11:57,691 --> 00:12:04,196
The beauty from Harvard Law and the blue-collar
fed from the wrong side of Brooklyn.

142
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:06,934
- So sad.
- Don't be a dick, Jess.

143
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:11,335
Thank you, Ray.

144
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:13,672
A sexist would've called me something else.

145
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:16,841
Why? You're such a dick.

146
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:20,112
- Up. Let's go.
- Where's the fire?

147
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,215
LAPD just found an unidentified
female body in a garage Dumpster.

148
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:25,417
So, what's that got to do with us?

149
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:28,423
Garage is next door to
our mosque, Al-Ankara.

150
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:41,200
This is not good... mosque
turning into a crime scene.

151
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:43,634
Now Al-Fawid's gonna shut
everything down and go to ground.

152
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:47,406
Think positive, Ray. Maybe
Al-Fawid did the murder.

153
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:50,642
We could arrest him without him
having to blow something up first.

154
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,811
I'll talk to my snitch. He knows
everything going on in that mosque.

155
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:57,115
Siefert, when are you gonna
cough that guy's name up already?

156
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:59,784
- My curiosity is killing me.
- Sorry, Cobb.

157
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:02,588
Golden rule of counterterrorism. Remember?

00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:46,764
Things a little slow today,
guys? No subpoenas to serve?

174
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:50,971
You really are an idiot, Fierro. Medically.

175
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,641
Impressive, huh? He was Homicide
before he joined the Bureau.

176
00:13:55,643 --> 00:13:57,209
Be the ball, Ray.

177
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,912
Be the ball, Ray.

178
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:02,714
No purse, no ID.

179
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,283
Body appears to have been
bleached inside and out.

180
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:08,753
Take notes, fellas. This
is evidence collection.

181
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:11,389
Custodian reports seeing
a young man, possibly Arab,

182
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,292
leaving the scene about 10:30,

183
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:14,759
carrying his belongings.

184
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:17,163
- Looked to be homeless.
- Was he running or walking?

185
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,500
- Didn't say.
- You mean, you didn't ask.

186
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:25,071
I didn't do the interview.

187
00:14:36,717 --> 00:14:40,319
Just 'cause they're Muslims
doesn't mean they're terrorists.

188
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:44,225
- Wouldn't wanna stereotype anybody, would we?
- No, of course not.

189
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:12,285
G-Give her some room.

190
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:17,891
They aren't even
spelling things right in here.

191
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:34,040
He's got a theory.

192
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,815
What is it?

193
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,752
It's Carolyn.

194
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:48,586
What?

195
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:51,322
I-It's Carolyn. It's your daughter.

196
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:58,297
No!

197
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,298
- No!
- Jess, Jess, Jess!

198
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,469
No! My girl!

199
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,542
No! No!

200
00:16:11,544 --> 00:16:13,845
No! No!

201
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,218
Please! No!

202
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:21,887
Help me! Help me!

203
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:25,590
Oh, my God!

204
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:28,695
Oh, sweet girl.

205
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:55,088
It's my baby!

206
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:07,366
Where... is he?

207
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:08,833
He's on parole.

208
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:11,669
Just did 10 years.

209
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:13,538
Tracy. Armed robbery.

210
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,445
Under the name...

211
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:21,247
Clay Beckwith.

212
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:27,151
How did you find him?

213
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:29,687
Inmate photos hacked online.

214
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:33,023
696,000 Caucasian males
in the US prison system.

215
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:35,526
You can cycle through the
entire population in a year

216
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:38,062
if you look at 1,906 faces every night.

217
00:17:38,064 --> 00:17:42,099
- So that's what I did.
- For a year?

218
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:44,703
For 13 years.

219
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:46,941
Started the day I left here.

220
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:51,842
The, uh... The nose is
different, and the eyes.

221
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:54,745
Yeah. Must've had surgery.

222
00:17:54,747 --> 00:17:57,048
Makes sense, given what
he did. And contact lenses.

223
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,717
But the ages sync up.

224
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:03,389
Beckwith's 33, Marzin 20 when we lost him.

225
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,059
What do you want?

226
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:09,963
Reopen it.

227
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:14,835
I'm without portfolio now. I
can't exactly contact the guy's PO.

228
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:18,904
Jess?

229
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:36,087
Surveillance video shows a gray
van entering this garage at 10:27,

230
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:38,023
leaving 20 minutes later.

231
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:41,561
Same van that was reported
stolen three days ago.

232
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:47,698
She have any errands in the
neighborhood or appointments?

233
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,503
I don't know. Where are we?

234
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,205
We're at the mosque.

235
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:55,175
Oh.

236
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:01,646
Would she take her car?

237
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:05,516
She didn't tell me what she
was... doing this morning

238
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:08,520
because she always told
me about her morning

239
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,688
at lunchtime.

240
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,358
<i>Jess?</i>

241
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:19,164
I thought if I ever found him, it
would just be me and him in an alley.

242
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,764
This is...

243
00:19:25,938 --> 00:19:28,874
I don't think I have the stomach
to watch him walk away again.

244
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,675
This is Claire's shop now.

245
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:33,712
- Nobody torches it this time.
- Right. Easy.

246
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,881
Except the police would have to run point, and
we never did have an actual case against him.

247
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,618
- Well, maybe he confesses.
- Would you?

248
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:44,289
Maybe we could go
about this a little less officially.

249
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,090
I could call the parole officer...

250
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:49,860
No, no, no. If we did this,
you couldn't be involved.

251
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:51,497
You know that.

252
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:55,268
- They're here.
- Yeah. Thank you.

253
00:19:56,903 --> 00:20:00,273
- Should I tell them you'll be late?
- Be along in a minute, yeah.

254
00:20:02,141 --> 00:20:05,543
- Good to see you, Ray.
- Hey, Jess.

255
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:07,982
You can leave it open.

256
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:13,918
So, this is how you waltz back in here?

257
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,990
I know.

258
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:19,193
I know.

259
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:24,763
Look at him.

260
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,665
Same guy.

261
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:30,635
We've had about 20 Marzin
sightings since you left.

262
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:33,938
All of them have been false alarms,
and Jess dies a little bit every time.

263
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,309
Claire, look at him.

264
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:40,278
You'd just be reopening a case.

265
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,179
For review. Under the radar.

266
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:43,982
- That's all we'd be doing.
- Yeah.

267
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,685
Let's pretend that
that's all we'd be doing.

268
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:48,852
Claire, I have to...

269
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:51,856
I have to leave. I have
to leave in two weeks.

270
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:54,626
I gotta be back after the first.

271
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,195
Please help me do this.

272
00:20:57,197 --> 00:21:00,064
It's everything.

273
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:02,233
Um, if you leave your number at the desk,

274
00:21:02,235 --> 00:21:04,336
I'll call you later.

275
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:06,737
Okay.

276
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:09,008
Okay.

277
00:21:16,048 --> 00:21:18,017
You know...

278
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,953
you always did belong here.

279
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:24,124
So did you.

280
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:33,831
Kasten, call your office. It's urgent.

281
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,669
Someone stole second base.

282
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:40,240
It's December, shithead.

283
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:44,202
I finished her room.

284
00:22:44,204 --> 00:22:46,273
It's all packed.

285
00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:57,247
Where will you go?

286
00:22:57,249 --> 00:22:59,218
Someplace quiet.

287
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,223
Outside the city.

288
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,626
Just not here.

289
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,964
Homicide hasn't found
anything yet, have they?

290
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:15,800
They will.

291
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:19,073
- What are we hearing from the mosque?
- A lot of praying.

292
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,741
Not much else.

293
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:25,342
Did you find his van?

294
00:23:25,344 --> 00:23:27,347
No.

295
00:23:29,181 --> 00:23:31,451
We found her car.

296
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:34,985
Where?

297
00:23:34,987 --> 00:23:36,857
Outside a bakery.

298
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:42,229
- Was it broken into?
- No.

299
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,206
It's just...

300
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,843
We're talking about...

301
00:23:58,844 --> 00:24:00,211
It's just impossible.

302
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:02,850
We're talking about Carolyn.

303
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:14,862
Um...

304
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:19,830
there's a lot of...

305
00:24:19,832 --> 00:24:22,336
stuff in the... in the garage to pack.

306
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:39,149
She made some beautiful things, didn't she?

307
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:41,155
Yeah.

308
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,160
Yeah, she did.

309
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:49,463
Who is this?

310
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:56,167
You ever see him before that day?

311
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:58,035
I don't remember seeing
him <i>on</i> that day.

312
00:24:58,037 --> 00:25:00,437
- This is the office picnic, right?
- Yeah.

313
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:02,840
She ever mention him to you?

314
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:04,444
Why would she?

315
00:25:10,382 --> 00:25:12,015
Mind if I take this?

316
00:25:12,017 --> 00:25:13,886
Sure.

317
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:16,924
Why?

318
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,862
I've seen this guy before.

319
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,173
- Hey, Bumpy.
- Hey.

320
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:37,641
Somebody here needs some help.

321
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:42,647
I always knew you'd be back.

322
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:46,016
- Great to see you, Bump.
- You too.

323
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:48,552
Nothing like Christmas in Los Angeles, huh?

324
00:25:48,554 --> 00:25:50,554
Sleighs, snow-covered streets.

325
00:25:50,556 --> 00:25:53,891
Are you up for a little field
work? Ray needs a few doors opened.

326
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:57,630
- Which ones?
- Old ones.

327
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:06,505
Guess I always knew he'd be back too.

328
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,279
I'm not sure how much use I'll be.

329
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,180
- I've been an indoor pet for a while now.
- I'll take my chances.

330
00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:19,617
We ask anybody else, red flags will go up.

331
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,356
Well, that's flattering.

332
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:26,559
Okay.

333
00:26:28,194 --> 00:26:30,897
This time it sticks, right?

334
00:26:32,332 --> 00:26:34,667
Thanks, Bumpy.

335
00:26:41,373 --> 00:26:42,974
That never got better?

336
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,311
- What?
- Your limp.

337
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,446
What limp?

338
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,517
- Hey, Bump.
- Yeah?

339
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,253
Who's this guy?

340
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:56,486
- Who, the guy in blue?
- Yeah.

341
00:26:56,488 --> 00:26:58,622
- This is the office picnic, right?
- Yeah.

342
00:26:58,624 --> 00:27:01,091
- Okay. Who's that?
- I don't know.

343
00:27:01,093 --> 00:27:03,863
- You didn't see him there?
- Yeah, but I don't know who he is.

344
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:07,665
Hey, who's this guy?

345
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,132
No idea.

346
00:27:09,134 --> 00:27:11,502
- Dave.
- Yeah?

347
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:14,038
Who's this guy? You're
standing right by him.

348
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,406
- Sorry.
- He's standing right by you.

349
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:18,009
I don't know him.

350
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,978
Rupert. This guy.

351
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,347
- You know him?
- Mm-mmm. No.

352
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,549
Hey, Siefert!

353
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:28,454
Siefert. Office picnic. This guy. He's
staring at Carolyn Cobb. Who is he?

354
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:32,023
What, are you working Homicide now?

355
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,359
You know the guy or not?

356
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,028
No.

357
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,163
Okay.

358
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:43,266
Okay, so a guy shows up at the
office picnic, except nobody saw him.

359
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:46,303
Half of you were there.
Nobody knows who he is.

360
00:27:46,305 --> 00:27:48,638
Is that right?

361
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,042
This guy.

362
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,913
No? No.

363
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,649
Okay.

364
00:27:58,017 --> 00:27:59,649
Let's do it this way.

365
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:02,356
I've seen this guy before, Bump.

366
00:28:16,268 --> 00:28:18,168
Hey.

367
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,839
Hey.

368
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:24,341
Can I give you some unsolicited advice,

369
00:28:24,343 --> 00:28:26,045
one cop to another?

370
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:31,815
You're kinda crossing a line here.

371
00:28:31,817 --> 00:28:34,318
You're using CT software
on a rape-murder case.

372
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,722
Things like that get noticed.

373
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:40,657
- So I should, what, ignore the lead?
- No.

374
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:44,594
You give the lead to the guys that are actually
investigating the case over at Homicide.

375
00:28:44,596 --> 00:28:46,664
You were brought here to fight terrorism.

376
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:49,266
Well, her body was found next
to the hottest mosque in LA.

377
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:52,436
What makes you think I'm
<i>not</i> fighting terrorism?

378
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:55,809
- I'm just trying to spare you an ass-kicking.
- Spare yourself.

379
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:58,775
- Okay?
- Spare myself.

380
00:28:58,777 --> 00:29:00,780
Right.

381
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:08,252
Goddamn it, I knew I'd
seen that guy before!

382
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:10,190
He's from the mosque!

383
00:29:14,694 --> 00:29:17,360
God, I hope
you're wrong about this.

384
00:29:17,362 --> 00:29:21,432
The idea that it could've been
someone connected to this office?

385
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:23,467
I don't think I could live with that.

386
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:26,204
Who's the lead on this at LAPD?

387
00:29:26,206 --> 00:29:27,871
Um, a detective named Guerrero.

388
00:29:27,873 --> 00:29:30,241
- Has he seen these?
- No.

389
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:34,278
No, I thought it might reflect badly on
the office, the guy being at the picnic,

390
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,813
so I wanted to show them to you first.

391
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:38,515
Thank you. I appreciate it.

392
00:29:38,517 --> 00:29:40,551
All right.

393
00:29:40,553 --> 00:29:43,221
Leave all this with me.
Get back to your CT work.

394
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:45,322
I'll get this Guerrero up to speed.

395
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:47,425
- I can take care of that.
- No, no, no.

396
00:29:47,427 --> 00:29:50,730
Nothing should ever come before
your terrorism cases. Ever.

397
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,831
It's not a problem for me,
sir, to put out a field report.

398
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:57,971
I can explain things to him. You
know, one <i>vato</i> to another.

399
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,675
Well, the thing is, sir, because
it's Jess, I wanna bird-dog this one.

400
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:09,049
They teach you some version of
"yes, sir" at the Bureau, don't they?

401
00:30:12,451 --> 00:30:15,153
Yes, sir.

402
00:30:15,155 --> 00:30:16,857
So?

403
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,565
Be careful in there. He's slick.

404
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:32,469
And unless I'm very wrong,
he's about to ask you to lunch.

405
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:34,437
Mean a lot to me if you said no.

406
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:36,809
How's Jess?

407
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,877
Did you find anything yet?

408
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,579
I did.

409
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:44,715
Aban Ghazala, the guy seen
running from the garage?

410
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:48,285
He'd been living down
there. Just confessed.

411
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:51,123
- Where is he?
- County.

412
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:56,459
Well, well, well. Our new star.

413
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:58,564
Come on in, Claire.

414
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:02,887
It's almost lunchtime. Are you hungry?

415
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:16,746
Hey.

416
00:31:16,748 --> 00:31:19,583
I wasn't here today, okay? We're
trying to assess him as a CT source.

417
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:21,785
- We gotta keep it quiet.
- Understood.

418
00:31:21,787 --> 00:31:23,989
<i>"C" Block, stand by.</i>

419
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,540
Ghazala?

420
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:48,745
You really are a dumb son of a bitch,
Siefert! Is that how cases get buried?

421
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:51,715
You find the nearest
Muslim and you ring him up?

422
00:31:51,717 --> 00:31:54,784
You're protecting someone, Siefert,
and you're gonna tell me who it is!

423
00:31:54,786 --> 00:31:56,654
Who are you protecting?

424
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:59,389
Just let me up! Let me up, Ray. Come on.

425
00:32:01,526 --> 00:32:04,164
Jesus God.

426
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:16,573
I was just trying to point
you away from someone.

427
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:19,709
That guy in that stupid picture of yours...

428
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:22,513
I can't have you questioning
him at the moment.

429
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:25,515
Why is that? Who is he?

430
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:27,818
- My snitch.
- Huh?

431
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,554
My guy in the Al-Ankara mosque.

432
00:32:31,556 --> 00:32:35,792
Th-The guy staring at
Carolyn Cobb is your snitch?

433
00:32:35,794 --> 00:32:38,795
- I don't think he's your doer, Kasten.
- Introduce us. I'll ask him.

434
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:42,433
'Cause he is this close to
giving us a whole sleeper cell!

435
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:44,568
You don't spook a guy like that.

436
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,071
- What the hell you bring him to the picnic for?
- He's a wannabe.

437
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:50,573
The guy's got some fantasy
of being a cop someday.

438
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:53,910
So I brought him to the picnic, I let him feel
like a big shot. Anything to keep him happy.

439
00:32:53,912 --> 00:32:57,548
- Well, it worked. He found his true love there.
- You don't know that.

440
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,784
I do know you tricked a phony
confession out of a guy who didn't do it!

441
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:03,587
My guy shuts down, everybody loses!

442
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,992
A couple more buildings come down maybe.

443
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,394
So I redirected things a bit.

444
00:33:10,396 --> 00:33:12,165
Sorry.

445
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:16,836
He got a name?

446
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:21,241
You want me to send
Jess in here to ask you?

447
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,415
Anzor Marzin.

448
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:32,949
Street name's Pac-Man.

449
00:33:32,951 --> 00:33:34,918
Where is he?

450
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,420
- Where is he?
- Hey, I don't know. Okay?

451
00:33:37,422 --> 00:33:39,725
Maybe you can find him.

452
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:44,230
Okay.

453
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,435
When's the last time you seen him?

454
00:33:50,602 --> 00:33:52,338
Ten days.

455
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:58,809
Carolyn Cobb was killed 10 days
ago. What's that, a coincidence?

456
00:33:58,811 --> 00:34:02,115
Detective on the case,
Guerrero, he know about all this?

457
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:05,382
Of course he does.

458
00:34:05,384 --> 00:34:08,519
- Guy understands the ugly truth.
- Meaning what?

459
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:11,388
Meaning, someone hands us good names,

460
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,823
his love life doesn't matter.

461
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:17,628
Jesus Christ!

462
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,365
All right.

463
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,700
All right, start writing.

464
00:34:23,702 --> 00:34:25,169
Address.

465
00:34:25,171 --> 00:34:28,773
His address, his girlfriend's
address, something useful.

466
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,111
Couldn't just let it go, huh?

467
00:34:32,845 --> 00:34:34,678
- A stripper, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

468
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,515
Well, that is exciting.
But she's not coming out.

469
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:41,151
- She's coming out.
- Yeah, right.

470
00:34:41,153 --> 00:34:44,053
And then Marzin's gonna
pull up in a stolen gray van

471
00:34:44,055 --> 00:34:47,024
with Carolyn's DNA under his
nails, and everybody wins.

472
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:50,727
You can forget about the van.
We're not gonna find it.

473
00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:53,497
You know what I like about you, Ray?

474
00:34:53,499 --> 00:34:55,932
We're not even <i>pretending</i>
to do this right.

475
00:34:55,934 --> 00:34:59,503
Meet the detective who's
actually in charge? Screw that.

476
00:34:59,505 --> 00:35:01,704
We're not just crossing
the line, we're burying it.

477
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:05,043
I don't need to know
Guerrero to know Guerrero.

478
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,515
I've seen guys eat a case before.

479
00:35:12,117 --> 00:35:14,920
I'm gonna go water that
bush over there, okay?

480
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:24,662
Swimming pools and movie stars.

481
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,339
Come on, Moose.

482
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:51,856
Nice stealth.

483
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,858
Well, if you had evidence on this asshole,
we could warrant him like professionals.

484
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,095
Hey, Bump. Get the door, will ya?

485
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:30,629
All right, check
upstairs. I'll watch the door.

486
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:57,146
- Did you find...
- Jesus!

487
00:37:57,148 --> 00:37:59,916
- Shit. You scared the hell out of me.
- I scared <i>you?</i>

488
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:04,053
- What the hell are you sneaking up on me for?
- Sorry. Did I wake you?

489
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:06,823
There's nothing upstairs.
Anything down here?

490
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:09,959
I don't know. Maybe.

491
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:11,294
Wow, this guy can really draw.

492
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:13,930
Shit!

493
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:16,700
What are you bitching
about? I gave you a cookie.

494
00:38:16,702 --> 00:38:18,135
Go, go, go, go, go.

495
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,307
- Get up there.
- I'm trying. Move that trash can.

496
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:26,713
Damn it!

497
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,213
Ouch! That is a bad bite.

498
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:34,050
- He looked rabid to me. Probably gonna die.
- We need to get back in there.

499
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:36,687
Why, to see how the comic book turns out?

500
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,390
Yeah, obviously.

501
00:38:39,392 --> 00:38:43,026
Yeah, I guess that would be huge. Epic.

502
00:38:43,028 --> 00:38:45,397
Probably a lot of clues in there.

503
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:49,700
You didn't take it, Bump.

504
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,037
- Pork rinds look pretty good.
- You couldn't have taken it. Nobody'd be that stupid.

505
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,305
Yeah, well, how about a Twinkie?

506
00:38:56,307 --> 00:38:59,544
- You hungry? You want a Twinkie?
- Bump?

507
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,912
Ohh.

508
00:39:02,914 --> 00:39:04,981
- Happy birthday!
- Dipshit.

509
00:39:04,983 --> 00:39:08,151
- What? She's not gonna miss it.
- She tells him someone was there, he never comes back!

510
00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:11,754
What's your brilliant idea? Leave it
on the bed? At least now we have it.

511
00:39:11,756 --> 00:39:14,191
Do me a favor, okay?
Let me run point on this.

512
00:39:14,193 --> 00:39:17,394
I'll put an extra dollar in
your paycheck, I swear to God.

513
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,365
Suit yourself.

514
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:24,233
All right, let me have it.

515
00:39:24,235 --> 00:39:26,437
- Thought you didn't want it.
- Bump, give me...

516
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:28,771
Bumpy, give me the...

517
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:31,041
Give me the...

518
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,414
Well, it looks like
you won another convert.

519
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,983
PO took one look at those
pictures, said, "Yep, same guy."

520
00:39:40,985 --> 00:39:42,452
What else he say?

521
00:39:42,454 --> 00:39:44,088
Said he knows him as Beckwith.

522
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,858
Never heard him called Marzin
or Pac-Man or anything else.

523
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,361
Beckwith checked in two weeks after
release, then skipped two weeks ago.

524
00:39:52,363 --> 00:39:55,298
I asked if he had any hobbies,
you know, like drawing,

525
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,367
or if he ever talked about baseball.

526
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:59,169
No and no.

527
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:03,774
But he does seem to like
horses. The racing kind.

528
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,843
Talks about them all the time.

529
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:09,512
In an unhealthy kind of
way, according to the PO.

530
00:40:09,514 --> 00:40:12,216
He has sort of a fixation.

531
00:40:12,218 --> 00:40:16,120
Uh, said, "If I had the time to do
it, I'd look for him at the track.

532
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:20,326
Horses might be the only thing he
likes as much as stealing cars."

533
00:40:51,023 --> 00:40:52,758
Hey.

534
00:40:55,961 --> 00:41:00,263
Your table, as I recall.

535
00:41:00,265 --> 00:41:03,468
He skipped parole,
didn't he? Your Beckwith.

536
00:41:05,537 --> 00:41:08,372
Wasn't much of a surprise.

537
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:10,073
Why?

538
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:12,108
And the PO doesn't recall Beckwith

539
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,477
having a particular talent
for drawing, does he?

540
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:17,916
His name's Marzin. Not Beckwith.

541
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:21,484
This why you called me here?

542
00:41:21,486 --> 00:41:24,021
Just trying to gauge
the value of your leads.

543
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,024
Thank you. But they're my leads.

544
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,795
And she was my kid.

545
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,329
Jess.

546
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:35,899
It's not gonna be like last time.

547
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:38,234
We find the guy, he goes down.

548
00:41:38,236 --> 00:41:41,104
- You shouldn't make promises like that.
- I can make that promise.

549
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:44,140
You know, everybody's
asking me, since you're back,

550
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:46,175
"Who is this guy?

551
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:49,178
What is it with his
obsession with your daughter?"

552
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,149
And I say, "Well, he's
a friend. He's a badge."

553
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:57,153
They say, "Yeah? Then where's
he been the last 13 years?"

554
00:41:57,155 --> 00:42:01,660
I was supposed to meet Carolyn
in that bakery the day she...

555
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:10,334
She was gonna have a...
a party for your birthday.

556
00:42:10,336 --> 00:42:12,301
I told her I'd meet her there

557
00:42:12,303 --> 00:42:14,338
and pay for the cake.

558
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,372
Last minute I begged off,

559
00:42:16,374 --> 00:42:19,276
after she'd already gotten there.

560
00:42:19,278 --> 00:42:22,044
I had...

561
00:42:22,046 --> 00:42:24,316
I had some case work to file.

562
00:42:26,918 --> 00:42:29,621
Two hours later, we found her.

563
00:42:34,293 --> 00:42:37,530
That's where I've been the last 13 years.

564
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:52,711
What happened to Siefert's face?

565
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,948
Hell if I know.

566
00:42:57,048 --> 00:42:59,115
I was hoping for a better answer than that.

567
00:42:59,117 --> 00:43:01,952
Well, I don't spend that much
time thinking about Siefert's face.

568
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,620
Assaulting an officer?

569
00:43:04,622 --> 00:43:07,256
Where the hell were
you and Bumpy yesterday?

570
00:43:07,258 --> 00:43:10,660
You do that in court? You
spin your chain like that?

571
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:13,629
- I do it when I'm anxious. You're making me anxious.
- Oh, yeah? Why is that?

572
00:43:13,631 --> 00:43:17,533
Because I caught the case. Ghazala.

573
00:43:17,535 --> 00:43:20,405
Morales put me on it.

574
00:43:21,472 --> 00:43:24,577
Of course he did. That son of a bitch.

575
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:29,178
You're being taken, Claire.
Ghazala's not your guy.

576
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,249
- You're gonna have to explain that.
- There's a snitch.

577
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:34,617
He's working Al-Ankara
mosque. His name's Marzin.

578
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:37,053
He's also a person of
interest on Carolyn Cobb.

579
00:43:37,055 --> 00:43:41,224
And everybody's running around, trying
to blow this thing up. He's the doer!

580
00:43:41,226 --> 00:43:43,961
Siefert squeezes a phony confession out
of Ghazala and the snitch stays untouched.

581
00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:46,229
'Cause he's working CT for <i>us.</i>

582
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:49,265
Now he turns up as the
rapist-murderer of a cop's kid?

583
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:51,468
No. No, can't be the guy.

584
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,071
Morales has assured me that this
case has the highest priority.

585
00:43:55,073 --> 00:43:57,376
Yeah. And Guantánamo's a Club Med resort.

586
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:06,084
Hey, Jess.

587
00:44:12,157 --> 00:44:15,394
- What you got there?
- Oh, it's nothing.

588
00:44:17,428 --> 00:44:21,033
- It's not for you.
- That's not what I hear.

589
00:44:22,735 --> 00:44:25,604
- Sorry.
- Is he the guy?

590
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:30,407
He's <i>a</i> guy.

591
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:32,776
That's all we know.

592
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:36,012
Anything in there indicate
a predilection for violence?

593
00:44:36,014 --> 00:44:38,148
It's a comic book.

594
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,885
They're all violent.

595
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:44,723
- Can I see it?
- Jess, you shouldn't be here.

596
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:48,460
Anything you touch is inadmissible.

597
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:57,936
- Can I see it?
- No.

598
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:02,575
Ray.

599
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:32,501
You have to be honest.
That's the only rule.

600
00:45:32,503 --> 00:45:35,305
- 'Cause she's good at this.
- All right. Okay.

601
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:37,673
- The truth and nothing but the truth.
- Wow. I'm ready.

602
00:45:37,675 --> 00:45:39,742
- Fear not.
- This is beautiful, by the way. Thank you.

603
00:45:39,744 --> 00:45:41,678
- You're welcome.
- It's beautiful.

604
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,419
Okay. So, are you looking
for a professional type?

605
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:49,586
Struggling actress type?

606
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:50,687
A what?

607
00:45:50,689 --> 00:45:53,289
Nurturing schoolteacher type?

608
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:56,559
I'm... I'm willing to
cast a wide net, so...

609
00:45:56,561 --> 00:45:58,495
- Very wise. Very wise.
- Thank you.

610
00:45:58,497 --> 00:46:02,566
Uh, how about tall? Short? Other?

611
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:06,102
- No preference?
- There's no preference, as long as she's smart.

612
00:46:06,104 --> 00:46:09,305
- How smart?
- Preferably Harvard-educated.

613
00:46:09,307 --> 00:46:10,807
Oh. Okay.

614
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,109
- From Philly.
- Hmm.

615
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:15,512
- Who's a prosecutor.
- I see.

616
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:17,582
Named Claire.

617
00:46:18,883 --> 00:46:22,352
- That might narrow the field a bit.
- That's very good. Very good.

618
00:46:22,354 --> 00:46:24,254
- What can I say?
- What <i>can</i> you say?

619
00:46:27,693 --> 00:46:30,629
You look a little quiet all of a sudden.

620
00:46:31,697 --> 00:46:33,999
Claire.

621
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,733
I think you should know
that I can't rein her in.

622
00:46:37,735 --> 00:46:40,470
She's not gonna stop
till she finds this guy.

623
00:46:40,472 --> 00:46:44,810
You never saw Jess and her
kid. They were inseparable.

624
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:47,744
Yeah.

625
00:46:47,746 --> 00:46:49,914
I can imagine.

626
00:46:55,287 --> 00:46:58,320
I know it's messy. I mean, working CT.

627
00:46:58,322 --> 00:47:02,358
But we gotta find this
guy before Jess does. Okay?

628
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,729
I'll work it at night, under the radar.

629
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:08,634
Morales doesn't have to know.

630
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:13,403
I can't tell you what to
do with your free time.

631
00:47:13,405 --> 00:47:17,474
My legal advice would be, find that van.

632
00:47:17,476 --> 00:47:19,242
Thank you.

633
00:47:19,244 --> 00:47:20,979
Good night.

634
00:47:23,182 --> 00:47:25,682
Uh, let me walk you to your car.

635
00:47:25,684 --> 00:47:29,619
- You don't have to do that.
- No, I'd like to, if you don't mind.

636
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:31,921
Something about garages lately.

637
00:47:31,923 --> 00:47:35,358
- So, when's the big day?
- Hmm?

638
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,064
Oh. Um, sometime next year.

639
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:43,300
- Congratulations.
- Oh.

640
00:47:43,302 --> 00:47:44,901
What's he do?

641
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,637
He manages a hedge fund in Philly.

642
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:49,941
His name is Ellis.

643
00:47:50,976 --> 00:47:53,510
So, what, is he... he moving here?

644
00:47:53,512 --> 00:47:55,845
That's the plan.

645
00:47:55,847 --> 00:48:00,684
Is that a hard thing to do, to manage a hedge
fund in Philly when you're living in LA?

646
00:48:00,686 --> 00:48:03,285
Might be.

647
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:06,555
- But he's pretty clever.
- I bet he is.

648
00:48:06,557 --> 00:48:08,791
Ellis is a pretty clever name.

649
00:48:08,793 --> 00:48:11,995
And love conquers all, right?

650
00:48:11,997 --> 00:48:14,333
That's me.

651
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,102
See you tomorrow.

652
00:48:24,709 --> 00:48:27,644
Jess is lucky to have you, Ray.

653
00:48:27,646 --> 00:48:29,879
You're a good friend.

654
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:32,881
She'd do the same for me.

655
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:34,886
She'd do more.

656
00:49:06,684 --> 00:49:08,920
God, this guy could be anywhere.

657
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:13,289
All right, I want to see the stables.

658
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,591
What the hell for?

659
00:49:15,593 --> 00:49:17,863
That's where the horses are.

660
00:49:45,657 --> 00:49:50,093
I love you, baby boy.

661
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:52,031
Ain't you?

662
00:50:02,573 --> 00:50:05,343
Look at you.

663
00:50:06,912 --> 00:50:08,947
Bump.

664
00:50:10,414 --> 00:50:11,914
I'll be damned.

665
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:14,517
You like that?

666
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:19,088
All right then. Shh.

667
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,259
Hey.

668
00:50:25,097 --> 00:50:27,199
Hey, buddy.

669
00:50:32,604 --> 00:50:36,472
Nice work on the face, Pac-Man. I like it.

670
00:50:36,474 --> 00:50:38,209
And you are?

671
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,077
You don't remember me?

672
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:44,747
Let's talk.

673
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:47,352
Call it in!

674
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:13,843
Ray.

675
00:51:13,845 --> 00:51:17,513
- Where did he get you?
- I had him, Bump.

676
00:51:17,515 --> 00:51:19,582
That was Marzin.

677
00:51:19,584 --> 00:51:22,419
It's okay. This is Luis.

678
00:51:22,421 --> 00:51:26,455
- He says the guy is here all the time boosting cars.
- The guy got a name?

679
00:51:26,457 --> 00:51:28,591
I-I don't talk to him.

680
00:51:28,593 --> 00:51:32,095
- I don't like the way he looks at the horses.
- You got a cell phone, Luis?

681
00:51:32,097 --> 00:51:33,729
Huh?

682
00:51:33,731 --> 00:51:35,501
Give it to me.

683
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,968
The guy comes in again,

684
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:44,506
text 911 to this number

685
00:51:44,508 --> 00:51:45,941
and I'll be here.

686
00:51:45,943 --> 00:51:47,776
- Bump, will ya?
- Yeah.

687
00:51:47,778 --> 00:51:50,613
I got it.

688
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:52,015
It's him, all right.

689
00:51:52,017 --> 00:51:53,850
Oh, yeah.

690
00:51:53,852 --> 00:51:56,452
Son of a bitch.

691
00:51:56,454 --> 00:51:58,222
Thanks, Luis.

692
00:52:09,901 --> 00:52:12,769
- Hi.
- Oh!

693
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:15,472
Um...

694
00:52:15,474 --> 00:52:18,207
- I was waiting for... I'm sorry.
- Oh. No.

695
00:52:18,209 --> 00:52:21,077
It's fine. Is there anything I can...

696
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:24,713
Well, I was just gonna see if you
wanted me to walk you to your car again.

697
00:52:24,715 --> 00:52:26,883
Oh.

698
00:52:26,885 --> 00:52:29,218
I wasn't ready to leave yet.

699
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,057
Neither was I.

700
00:52:34,258 --> 00:52:37,760
- Something making you nervous?
- Oh, this.

701
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:41,263
It's a... It's a silly habit.

702
00:52:41,265 --> 00:52:44,368
It's kind of endearing, if you ask me.

703
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:49,241
Then it's yours.

704
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:53,642
Well, you need it more than I do anyway.

705
00:52:53,644 --> 00:52:55,513
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

706
00:52:58,782 --> 00:53:03,119
You sure you can live without it? I
know how you heady types tend to obsess.

707
00:53:03,121 --> 00:53:06,557
That's right. Obsessing is awful.

708
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,328
Hope it never happens to you.

709
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,569
Let me, uh...

710
00:53:18,637 --> 00:53:21,937
I-I...

711
00:53:21,939 --> 00:53:24,142
I like the one on page 90, by the way.

712
00:53:25,242 --> 00:53:27,977
I mean, I don't know, but I think you...

713
00:53:27,979 --> 00:53:31,280
you'd break hearts in that dress.

714
00:53:31,282 --> 00:53:33,417
That's sweet.

715
00:53:34,653 --> 00:53:37,153
Yeah, really sweet, Ray. Come with me.

716
00:53:37,155 --> 00:53:39,992
Uh, would you excuse us, Claire?

717
00:53:43,227 --> 00:53:45,562
Please tell me I've been misinformed.

718
00:53:45,564 --> 00:53:49,298
Please tell me no one from this office
broke into the home of a stripper

719
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,934
to steal a comic book

720
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:55,604
in some half-assed attempt at making
a case against a prime CT asset.

721
00:53:55,606 --> 00:53:59,742
- There's a case to be made, sir.
- With a picture from a picnic as evidence.

722
00:53:59,744 --> 00:54:03,912
And no participation from the
actual cop investigating the case.

723
00:54:03,914 --> 00:54:06,849
This how you do things in New York? Hmm?

724
00:54:06,851 --> 00:54:09,818
No warrant. You just
surveil whomever you wish.

725
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,120
My sense was that your enthusiasm
for the target was low, sir.

726
00:54:12,122 --> 00:54:14,691
I'll tell you what's lower...

727
00:54:14,693 --> 00:54:18,227
my "enthusiasm" for
witnessing another 9/11.

728
00:54:18,229 --> 00:54:20,162
Jesus Christ.

729
00:54:20,164 --> 00:54:23,332
Everybody knows those
assholes want to hit LA next!

730
00:54:23,334 --> 00:54:27,035
Half the families in my neighborhood
are buying duct tape and hazmat suits!

731
00:54:27,037 --> 00:54:30,205
You don't even have a case against this guy!
You don't have his van. You don't have shit!

732
00:54:30,207 --> 00:54:31,975
If I did, would you file?

733
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,910
No, I'd let a rapist-murderer go free!

734
00:54:33,912 --> 00:54:35,278
Jess is a friend of mine.

735
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,615
You'd charge him, politics aside?

736
00:54:38,617 --> 00:54:41,818
And while you're doing this, how
many CT leads are going unpursued?

737
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,354
How many hurdles are you placing between
Marzin and his ultimate use to us,

738
00:54:45,356 --> 00:54:47,155
which is intel on the mosque?

739
00:54:47,157 --> 00:54:50,258
If I had evidence on him tying him
to Carolyn Cobb, you'd charge him?

740
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,028
Of course!

741
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:54,433
- I have your word on that?
- Did I just stutter?

742
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,771
And by the way,

743
00:55:01,773 --> 00:55:04,207
Harvard Law doesn't date community college.

744
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:07,511
Stop hitting on my new hire.
You're embarrassing yourself.

745
00:55:10,715 --> 00:55:15,220
You were always beautiful,
but so ambitious.

746
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,589
I prefer "determined."

747
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:22,124
Political.

748
00:55:22,126 --> 00:55:24,428
Collegial.

749
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,765
Oblivious.

750
00:55:30,068 --> 00:55:33,836
I think you like looking
back more than I do.

751
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:36,338
I don't have the time for it.

752
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,941
Okay. Let's look forward.

753
00:55:38,943 --> 00:55:41,843
Okay, let's.

754
00:55:41,845 --> 00:55:45,013
- I think you should go back to New York.
- Why?

755
00:55:45,015 --> 00:55:48,316
Because I don't like where this is going, and
I can't justify it for a case that isn't there.

756
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:52,954
Oh, it's there. I got two broken
ribs from a shovel says it's there.

757
00:55:52,956 --> 00:55:54,957
That was Marzin.

758
00:55:54,959 --> 00:55:57,260
- I need two more men.
- What?

759
00:55:57,262 --> 00:56:01,229
Bumpy's on one leg, and truth
is I don't move like I used to.

760
00:56:01,231 --> 00:56:04,166
Come on, Ray. You move
exactly like you used to.

761
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,238
They don't have to be big men.

762
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,175
Get out.

763
00:56:12,177 --> 00:56:14,744
I mean it. Go home.

764
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,479
I can't.

765
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:19,015
9/11 was just the beginning.

766
00:56:19,017 --> 00:56:23,251
Protect your home, please.
Protect your family.

767
00:56:23,253 --> 00:56:25,387
Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein...

768
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:27,222
they have Anthrax now.

769
00:56:28,959 --> 00:56:31,961
Bump. What is it? You said
you had a lead on Marzin.

770
00:56:31,963 --> 00:56:33,396
- We do.
- "We"?

771
00:56:33,398 --> 00:56:35,332
Come here.

772
00:56:49,012 --> 00:56:51,816
- Hey, Jess.
- I hate the death penalty.

773
00:56:54,785 --> 00:56:56,318
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

774
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,155
Death would be too good for this guy.

775
00:56:59,157 --> 00:57:02,858
A big meal and a... shot and a nap.

776
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,528
Let him rot in jail, live
a life full of nothing.

777
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:08,466
Uh-huh.

778
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:13,705
- What we doing here, guys?
- Waiting for him.

779
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:17,539
- He's been here?
- He will be.

780
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:19,841
Bumpy and I figured it out.

781
00:57:19,843 --> 00:57:22,211
Jess, you come within a mile of
this guy, we never make a case.

782
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:24,312
He can quit his job,
he can change his name,

783
00:57:24,314 --> 00:57:28,316
he can dump his car, but
I will still find him.

784
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:31,287
'Cause there's one thing you can't change,

785
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:33,258
and it's right here.

786
00:57:34,825 --> 00:57:37,392
Are you drunk?

787
00:57:37,394 --> 00:57:41,229
<i>The Justifier</i> by Pac-Man Marzin.

788
00:57:41,231 --> 00:57:43,832
Page one, first character...

789
00:57:43,834 --> 00:57:47,135
a monster hunter named Alston Sherry.

790
00:57:47,137 --> 00:57:48,805
- Bumpy?
- Alston.

791
00:57:48,807 --> 00:57:51,106
Could that be Walter Alston,

792
00:57:51,108 --> 00:57:53,943
the winningest manager in
the history of the Dodgers?

793
00:57:53,945 --> 00:57:56,312
He won four World Series
titles, three of 'em here in LA.

794
00:57:56,314 --> 00:57:59,816
And Sherry. Larry Sherry?

795
00:57:59,818 --> 00:58:02,017
The MVP of the '59 World Series.

796
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:05,120
That's the first championship here in LA.

797
00:58:05,122 --> 00:58:08,457
Not that it matters, but he had two
wins and two saves in that series.

798
00:58:08,459 --> 00:58:10,392
Page two.

799
00:58:10,394 --> 00:58:13,396
Alston's partner, named Bulldog O'Malley.

800
00:58:13,398 --> 00:58:15,932
- Bump?
- Walter O'Malley?

801
00:58:15,934 --> 00:58:19,234
The owner who brought the
Dodgers to LA from Brooklyn.

802
00:58:19,236 --> 00:58:22,437
- Man was a saint.
- You seeing a pattern here, Ray?

803
00:58:22,439 --> 00:58:25,441
How about "Bulldog," huh?
Orel "Bulldog" Hershiser?

804
00:58:25,443 --> 00:58:29,211
Star of the last Dodger team that
won a series, '88? Before we sucked.

805
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:31,247
So, why are we here, Bumpy?

806
00:58:31,249 --> 00:58:35,017
'Cause this is the place
where ex-Dodgers hang out.

807
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:37,388
And all the crazies know it.

808
00:58:39,256 --> 00:58:43,859
And by the way, the monster that
O'Malley and Sherry are chasing

809
00:58:43,861 --> 00:58:46,062
is orange and black.

810
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:49,432
You know, the colors worn
by that, uh, team up north.

811
00:58:49,434 --> 00:58:51,466
Think I'd have noticed
that a little sooner.

812
00:58:51,468 --> 00:58:53,301
Don't beat yourself up, Bump.

813
00:58:53,303 --> 00:58:54,870
Think Blue.

814
00:58:54,872 --> 00:58:56,439
See?

815
00:58:56,441 --> 00:59:01,176
Passions... are like maps.

816
00:59:01,178 --> 00:59:03,445
Take me, for example.

817
00:59:03,447 --> 00:59:05,382
Carolyn is...

818
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:10,519
<i>was...</i>

819
00:59:10,521 --> 00:59:15,157
the thing that made me me.

820
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:17,896
Nothing will ever change that.

821
00:59:19,063 --> 00:59:23,099
Take you. The way you
keep thinking about Claire.

822
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,533
It's a lost cause.

823
00:59:25,535 --> 00:59:27,539
But you don't give up.

824
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:33,309
Passion always wins.

825
00:59:33,311 --> 00:59:36,781
So I will be here every night from now on.

826
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:40,417
He'll come here.

827
00:59:42,387 --> 00:59:44,352
Kind of a long shot.

828
00:59:44,354 --> 00:59:46,857
Crazy. I know.

829
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:51,526
Sort of like building a whole case

830
00:59:51,528 --> 00:59:55,700
around a picture from an office picnic.

831
00:59:57,401 --> 01:00:00,102
But you look at enough faces,

832
01:00:00,104 --> 01:00:02,671
you're bound to find the
one you're looking for.

833
01:00:02,673 --> 01:00:04,876
Eventually, right?

834
01:00:14,418 --> 01:00:16,453
So, when's the next game?

835
01:00:41,445 --> 01:00:43,745
<i>This capacity
crowd coming to life now</i>

836
01:00:43,747 --> 01:00:47,182
<i>as the Dodgers have
gotten off the mat.</i>

837
01:00:47,184 --> 01:00:49,751
<i>Onlinger checks the
runner, rocks and deals.</i>

838
01:00:49,753 --> 01:00:52,521
<i>Way outside. Ball four.</i>

839
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:56,091
<i>And that fast, Manager Dave
McDaniels out of the dugout,</i>

840
01:00:56,093 --> 01:00:58,093
<i>on his way to the mound.</i>

841
01:00:58,095 --> 01:01:01,696
<i>We'll see if he's
bringing a hook with him.</i>

842
01:01:01,698 --> 01:01:06,267
<i>The 2002 Met bullpen has not
been particularly impressive.</i>

843
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,914
Yo, buddy, sit down!

844
01:01:17,782 --> 01:01:20,282
Sit down!

845
01:01:20,284 --> 01:01:23,388
- I'm looking for my uncle.
- Yeah, and I'm trying to watch the game.

846
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:28,124
You know, after 10 nights of
this, I'm ready to learn something.

847
01:01:28,126 --> 01:01:29,691
Bump.

848
01:01:29,693 --> 01:01:33,562
Ten rows up, seven guys in.

849
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,798
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
- Okay.

850
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,602
<i>Now batting, number 11,</i>

851
01:01:39,604 --> 01:01:42,704
<i>shortstop Drew Sagano.</i>

852
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:47,276
Excuse me.

853
01:01:47,278 --> 01:01:49,211
<i>The Dodgers sending
the go-ahead run to the plate.</i>

854
01:01:49,213 --> 01:01:51,513
Sir. Excuse me. Excuse me.

855
01:01:51,515 --> 01:01:55,050
- Hey, Marzin! Hey!
- Hey!

856
01:01:55,052 --> 01:01:56,551
Sorry.

857
01:01:56,553 --> 01:01:58,787
Down in front.

858
01:01:58,789 --> 01:02:01,157
Let's go. Come on, move!

859
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:05,095
<i>Onlinger ready to go back
to work now, checking the runners.</i>

860
01:02:11,068 --> 01:02:12,568
Bump! With me!

861
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,472
<i>Delivers. Belted.</i>

862
01:02:19,677 --> 01:02:22,180
Out of the way!

863
01:02:33,356 --> 01:02:35,791
Bump! Check down there!

864
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:38,729
Hey, Kennedy, shield the exits! Over there!

865
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:45,700
<i>Long trek
back out to the mound.</i>

866
01:02:45,702 --> 01:02:49,405
<i>Suddenly, on the wrong
side of a one-run game,</i>

867
01:02:49,407 --> 01:02:52,807
<i>history repeating itself...</i>

868
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:54,745
- What the hell, bro!
- Jesus.

869
01:02:58,582 --> 01:03:00,682
<i>The crowd refusing to sit</i>

870
01:03:00,684 --> 01:03:04,186
<i>until Sagano emerges
to take a curtain call.</i>

871
01:03:04,188 --> 01:03:06,024
Aah! God!

872
01:03:09,126 --> 01:03:11,028
Move!

873
01:03:20,137 --> 01:03:22,470
- I got the suspect.
- Hey!

874
01:03:22,472 --> 01:03:24,573
Stop! Marzin, stop!

875
01:03:24,575 --> 01:03:26,478
Marzin!

876
01:03:29,546 --> 01:03:31,180
Goddamn it!

877
01:03:33,751 --> 01:03:35,751
You okay?

878
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:38,522
- Get him!
- Suspect is...

879
01:04:08,418 --> 01:04:10,753
Hey!

880
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:13,857
Hold it right there!

881
01:04:18,963 --> 01:04:21,566
Get out of the way!

882
01:04:34,244 --> 01:04:35,778
- You got him?
- Yeah.

883
01:04:37,514 --> 01:04:39,716
- Stay where you are.
- Son of a bitch!

884
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:47,323
<i>The Dodgers, nine games back
and left for dead just 30 days ago,</i>

885
01:04:47,325 --> 01:04:48,957
<i>can see daylight now.</i>

886
01:04:48,959 --> 01:04:51,459
<i>Just a half a game back in the West,</i>

887
01:04:51,461 --> 01:04:54,495
<i>with a 6-5 lead in the
bottom of the eighth.</i>

888
01:04:54,497 --> 01:04:56,932
<i>Quite a night.</i>

889
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,001
What are you trying to do,

890
01:04:59,003 --> 01:05:00,936
get yourself suspended,
sent back to New York?

891
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:03,571
We didn't know the guy would
run. It was a baseball game.

892
01:05:03,573 --> 01:05:06,242
We were just there to ask him a
couple of questions, but then he ran!

893
01:05:06,244 --> 01:05:08,577
Don't do that to me. Don't talk
to me like you talk to Morales.

894
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:10,312
I know what you were there to do.

895
01:05:10,314 --> 01:05:12,381
- What were we supposed to do, let him go?
- Yes.

896
01:05:12,383 --> 01:05:14,416
We don't have anything on
him. I want him released.

897
01:05:14,418 --> 01:05:16,017
- You don't wanna question him first?
- No!

898
01:05:16,019 --> 01:05:18,754
I want him advised of his rights
and released before Morales...

899
01:05:18,756 --> 01:05:21,390
Morales will file if I can make a case.

900
01:05:21,392 --> 01:05:23,725
And Marzin already knows his
rights. He's here voluntarily.

901
01:05:23,727 --> 01:05:26,629
He'll confess! I just
gotta work him a little.

902
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:29,798
- Meaning waterboarding?
- No, meaning conversation.

903
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,434
Five minutes. If you don't
think he's the doer, he walks.

904
01:05:33,436 --> 01:05:35,303
Claire.

905
01:05:35,305 --> 01:05:36,939
Claire, come on. We can't just let him go.

906
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:39,408
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

907
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:41,679
I'm sorry.

908
01:05:42,847 --> 01:05:44,646
I'm begging you.

909
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:48,118
I'm begging <i>you.</i>

910
01:05:51,856 --> 01:05:54,523
I just wanna remind you

911
01:05:54,525 --> 01:05:57,459
that you're here of your own volition.

912
01:05:57,461 --> 01:06:00,263
You're free to go at any time.

913
01:06:02,465 --> 01:06:04,733
"Volition."

914
01:06:04,735 --> 01:06:07,535
That's a great word.

915
01:06:07,537 --> 01:06:10,838
I think I'm gonna use that
someday, when I'm a cop.

916
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,408
- You understand your rights.
- Yeah.

917
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,443
Is this about the mosque?

918
01:06:15,445 --> 01:06:17,214
No.

919
01:06:21,052 --> 01:06:22,950
This is about Carolyn Cobb.

920
01:06:22,952 --> 01:06:25,354
Who?

921
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,091
Carolyn Cobb.

922
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:31,194
Mmm.

923
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,930
I never met her.

924
01:06:35,932 --> 01:06:39,734
I don't remember this picture.

925
01:06:39,736 --> 01:06:42,704
- Where is this?
- It's the office picnic.

926
01:06:42,706 --> 01:06:46,642
You were the guest of Reggie
Siefert, your rabbi in here,

927
01:06:46,644 --> 01:06:49,378
your godfather.

928
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,716
Oh, yeah, yeah. I came for the
picnic for 10 minute, maybe.

929
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,551
Music was shit.

930
01:06:56,553 --> 01:07:00,055
That... Is that a Glock 9?

931
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,260
That's standard issue, right?

932
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:06,394
Why did you run from us?

933
01:07:06,396 --> 01:07:08,430
You serious?

934
01:07:08,432 --> 01:07:10,765
I'm ratting on the
sickest sleeper cell in LA.

935
01:07:10,767 --> 01:07:14,939
I get spotted chatting with
two cops, I'm a dead man.

936
01:07:15,972 --> 01:07:18,474
Wait.

937
01:07:18,476 --> 01:07:21,011
Are you the guys who took my comic book?

938
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,981
Yeah, fuckhead.

939
01:07:25,615 --> 01:07:28,019
I'm the guy that took your comic book.

940
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,423
Carolyn Cobb.

941
01:07:34,624 --> 01:07:37,392
I think you raped her
and killed her, Pac-Man.

942
01:07:37,394 --> 01:07:39,026
Hmm.

943
01:07:39,028 --> 01:07:40,995
Yeah, that would be smart

944
01:07:40,997 --> 01:07:43,599
'cause I don't have enough
heat on me as it is, do I?

945
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,401
So...

946
01:07:45,403 --> 01:07:47,803
I think you met her at the picnic,

947
01:07:47,805 --> 01:07:50,171
convinced yourself that
she was interested in you,

948
01:07:50,173 --> 01:07:53,941
and then maybe after a couple
of days following her around,

949
01:07:53,943 --> 01:07:57,111
you went up to her,
declared your undying love,

950
01:07:57,113 --> 01:07:59,013
and when she told you to piss off,

951
01:07:59,015 --> 01:08:02,751
you raped her and killed her
and dumped her body in the trash,

952
01:08:02,753 --> 01:08:06,120
doused in bleach.

953
01:08:06,122 --> 01:08:07,789
- Bleach?
- Where'd you hide the van?

954
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:11,426
I'm... I'm trying to do good.

955
01:08:11,428 --> 01:08:13,595
- Pretty girl.
- Okay, you should be thanking me.

956
01:08:13,597 --> 01:08:17,135
I'm not even saying I'm
blaming you for taking the shot.

957
01:08:18,436 --> 01:08:20,872
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

958
01:08:24,775 --> 01:08:27,642
You need to walk away. He
has a lawyer in the building.

959
01:08:27,644 --> 01:08:30,882
- He hasn't made any calls.
- He has friends here, remember?

960
01:08:33,918 --> 01:08:36,186
Look, I just need a few more minutes.

961
01:08:46,563 --> 01:08:49,765
No, that won't be necessary.

962
01:08:49,767 --> 01:08:52,167
Mr. Marzin has been a very
good friend to this office.

963
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:54,002
I thought I made that clear to you.

964
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:56,207
May I see the file, please?

965
01:08:59,076 --> 01:09:01,012
Hmm.

966
01:09:06,717 --> 01:09:09,551
Mr. Marzin.

967
01:09:09,553 --> 01:09:12,488
You're free to go. We're sorry
if we've inconvenienced you.

968
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:14,922
- This is not your doer.
- How do you know?

969
01:09:14,924 --> 01:09:21,262
Read the file. Carolyn Cobb,
5'7", 130 pounds, an athlete.

970
01:09:21,264 --> 01:09:24,266
"The damage to the right parietal
bone and left mandible of the victim

971
01:09:24,268 --> 01:09:29,770
indicated that the attacker was of
extraordinary physical strength."

972
01:09:29,772 --> 01:09:33,508
You see? We're looking
for a brute, not a kid.

973
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:37,745
You can't overpower a girl like that
with two noodles for arms. It's laughable.

974
01:09:37,747 --> 01:09:40,716
And then, of course, there's the bleach.

975
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:43,017
A clear sign of premeditation.

976
01:09:43,019 --> 01:09:47,055
Your killer knew enough to douse
the victim thoroughly inside and out

977
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:49,157
so as to destroy all the DNA evidence.

978
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:51,293
Now, that takes smarts. It
takes strategic thinking.

979
01:09:51,295 --> 01:09:53,531
What is your level of
education, Mr. Marzin?

980
01:09:54,564 --> 01:09:57,900
What is it, high school? Less than that?

981
01:09:57,902 --> 01:10:00,002
We're looking for an intellect.

982
01:10:00,004 --> 01:10:03,238
This one likes to sit in his room
and draw comic books with monsters

983
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,043
and maybe jack off to
the posters on his wall.

984
01:10:08,312 --> 01:10:11,245
Which brings me to the final
piece of exculpatory evidence.

985
01:10:11,247 --> 01:10:13,614
Which means, Mr. Marzin,

986
01:10:13,616 --> 01:10:17,151
evidence which proves your
innocence of the charge.

987
01:10:17,153 --> 01:10:19,754
"Examination of the
decedent's vaginal walls

988
01:10:19,756 --> 01:10:22,525
indicate injuries at a
depth of nine inches."

989
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,993
We're looking for someone with a hammer,

990
01:10:25,995 --> 01:10:27,663
not a peanut.

991
01:10:29,165 --> 01:10:32,868
- You have no idea what he...
- Women always know.

992
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:35,604
Men carry themselves one way, boys another.

993
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:39,209
Don't they? Don't they, Mr. Marzin?

994
01:10:41,711 --> 01:10:43,878
And that right there.

995
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,484
Trying to look down my blouse.
That's something a boy would do.

996
01:10:49,652 --> 01:10:52,354
So you run along, little one.

997
01:10:52,356 --> 01:10:55,257
You run along.

998
01:10:55,259 --> 01:10:58,362
We're sorry for the mix-up.

999
01:11:28,224 --> 01:11:29,992
"Peanut."

1000
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:33,060
Is that what you said, you cocky bitch?

1001
01:11:33,062 --> 01:11:36,364
Gosh. How impressive.

1002
01:11:36,366 --> 01:11:39,935
Am I swooning?

1003
01:11:39,937 --> 01:11:42,169
Go home, loser.

1004
01:11:42,171 --> 01:11:44,172
Draw yourself some more monsters.

1005
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,874
- You want some of this, bitch?
- We're done here.

1006
01:11:46,876 --> 01:11:48,677
- You want what she got?
- What?

1007
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,278
Here's what she got!

1008
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,780
You don't touch her! You don't touch her!

1009
01:11:52,782 --> 01:11:54,682
You don't touch her!

1010
01:11:54,684 --> 01:11:57,252
- Son of a...
- You don't touch her! I'll kill you!

1011
01:11:57,254 --> 01:11:59,253
Ray! Ray!

1012
01:11:59,255 --> 01:12:01,789
- Goddamn it!
- Ray! Ray, enough!

1013
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,659
Ray! Ray. It's okay. Get off! Ray!

1014
01:12:04,661 --> 01:12:08,230
It's okay. Ray!

1015
01:12:08,232 --> 01:12:09,965
Ray! It's okay.

1016
01:12:09,967 --> 01:12:12,066
He said it!

1017
01:12:12,068 --> 01:12:14,771
- You okay?
- We got him.

1018
01:12:22,912 --> 01:12:25,016
Lock him up.

1019
01:12:29,085 --> 01:12:33,356
- Oh, God.
- You okay? You okay?

1020
01:13:38,955 --> 01:13:40,489
You're letting him go, aren't you?

1021
01:13:40,491 --> 01:13:42,757
You think I'm stupid, sir?

1022
01:13:42,759 --> 01:13:45,060
That's two questions. Which one
do you want me to answer first?

1023
01:13:45,062 --> 01:13:46,994
- Hello, Claire.
- You and I had an understanding!

1024
01:13:46,996 --> 01:13:49,396
Yes, that you would bring me
a case. But you don't have one.

1025
01:13:49,398 --> 01:13:51,900
Just this half-assed
confession from Marzin,

1026
01:13:51,902 --> 01:13:53,467
who claims it was beaten out of him.

1027
01:13:53,469 --> 01:13:55,936
- And he's got the injuries to prove it!
- He attacked Claire!

1028
01:13:55,938 --> 01:13:58,273
You want me to trade a whole
mosque full of potential arrests

1029
01:13:58,275 --> 01:14:00,408
for a comic book and a
picture from a picnic?

1030
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:03,345
Put me in the goddamn mosque! I'll
get you more names than he will!

1031
01:14:03,347 --> 01:14:06,484
If that'll get you out of my office.

1032
01:14:07,817 --> 01:14:10,284
You looked me right in the eye.
You told me you'd prosecute.

1033
01:14:10,286 --> 01:14:15,090
I also told you nothing comes before
our efforts in counterterrorism. Nothing!

1034
01:14:15,092 --> 01:14:18,959
Now, you drop this right now or I'm sending
you back to the Bureau! You understand me?

1035
01:14:18,961 --> 01:14:22,230
That boy is officially untouchable!

1036
01:14:22,232 --> 01:14:24,168
Untouchable?

1037
01:14:25,302 --> 01:14:27,101
He's guilty.

1038
01:14:27,103 --> 01:14:29,370
Welcome to the war.

1039
01:14:33,477 --> 01:14:37,044
There's a time to shut up, Claire, and
there's a time to tell your boss the truth.

1040
01:14:37,046 --> 01:14:39,314
When he's being a horse's ass,
that's when you tell him the truth!

1041
01:14:39,316 --> 01:14:41,983
You really turned him around in
there. You just knocked him flat.

1042
01:14:41,985 --> 01:14:45,854
- But it's your case!
- We don't have a case!

1043
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:48,258
You wanna tell Jess that, or should I?

1044
01:15:27,363 --> 01:15:30,632
- Son of a bitch!
- Ray. Ray. Come on. Come on.

1045
01:15:44,615 --> 01:15:46,550
Jess.

1046
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,367
Cover your ears.

1047
01:16:05,369 --> 01:16:07,704
- What?
- You don't wanna hear this.

1048
01:16:08,972 --> 01:16:10,673
Let's kill him.

1049
01:16:12,209 --> 01:16:16,977
Let's kill him. Let's do it
now, before we lose him again.

1050
01:16:16,979 --> 01:16:19,513
We just do it and that's it. He goes.

1051
01:16:19,515 --> 01:16:21,615
Nobody will miss him.

1052
01:16:21,617 --> 01:16:25,587
We'll make the case on the mosque
without him, and Carolyn gets to rest.

1053
01:16:25,589 --> 01:16:28,455
And then what?

1054
01:16:28,457 --> 01:16:32,360
What would a few bullets
get me? A lifetime in jail.

1055
01:16:32,362 --> 01:16:35,596
So he dies without ever serving a day,

1056
01:16:35,598 --> 01:16:38,699
and I spend the next 50 years

1057
01:16:38,701 --> 01:16:40,604
envying him.

1058
01:16:41,671 --> 01:16:44,007
Does that sound like justice to you?

1059
01:16:52,448 --> 01:16:55,617
You're both working for a liar.

1060
01:16:58,021 --> 01:17:01,592
That's the trouble with you, Ray.

1061
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:05,461
You think that matters.

1062
01:17:47,504 --> 01:17:51,672
So, then... would 26 be too old?

1063
01:17:51,674 --> 01:17:54,208
Yes. Who's the guy?

1064
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:57,645
- Would 25?
- <i>Who's the guy?</i>

1065
01:17:57,647 --> 01:18:00,448
<i>He's a student like me.</i>

1066
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:03,020
<i>- How old is this...
- Twenty-one... ish.</i>

1067
01:18:05,121 --> 01:18:06,788
That's clever.

1068
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:09,490
You start me at 26, so that 21,

1069
01:18:09,492 --> 01:18:12,427
which is really 22, sounds reasonable.

1070
01:18:12,429 --> 01:18:14,495
I admire that.

1071
01:18:14,497 --> 01:18:16,263
Thank you.

1072
01:18:16,265 --> 01:18:18,400
- But I'm still not gonna say yes.
- Mom!

1073
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,838
- What?
- He already asked me out.

1074
01:18:22,071 --> 01:18:24,739
But it would mean missing
your office picnic.

1075
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:29,077
This just gets worse and
worse. I want you to be there.

1076
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:31,311
<i>I only have three
more months with you,</i>

1077
01:18:31,313 --> 01:18:33,080
<i>and then you're 2,000 miles away,</i>

1078
01:18:33,082 --> 01:18:36,051
and it's dorm life and frat parties,

1079
01:18:36,053 --> 01:18:39,186
and I'll seem boring by comparison.

1080
01:18:39,188 --> 01:18:42,190
Come, please.

1081
01:18:42,192 --> 01:18:43,927
Come.

1082
01:19:06,715 --> 01:19:09,118
I think I have to quit.

1083
01:19:10,821 --> 01:19:15,355
You wanna bet on whether I get
called back to New York tomorrow?

1084
01:19:15,357 --> 01:19:16,858
Claire.

1085
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,796
Yeah?

1086
01:19:22,165 --> 01:19:24,865
If I am...

1087
01:19:32,209 --> 01:19:35,310
A van's just been found
wrecked on Grand Street.

1088
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:37,811
Driver fled. Inside smells like bleach.

1089
01:19:37,813 --> 01:19:39,847
He tried to move it. He tried to move it!

1090
01:19:39,849 --> 01:19:42,084
Give me the keys. I'll drive!

1091
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,454
We find anything in there that ID's Marzin,

1092
01:19:47,456 --> 01:19:50,291
we might actually have him.

1093
01:19:50,293 --> 01:19:53,096
Maybe you won't have to go.

1094
01:20:05,275 --> 01:20:07,876
Oh.

1095
01:20:07,878 --> 01:20:10,481
Oh, God.

1096
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,136
Welcome to the war.

1097
01:20:35,738 --> 01:20:38,007
You think Morales did this?

1098
01:20:39,276 --> 01:20:42,776
Of course he did.

1099
01:20:42,778 --> 01:20:45,015
He had to.

1100
01:21:10,839 --> 01:21:12,407
Ray.

1101
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,278
Claire, I'm sorry.

1102
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:36,230
I don't know. I've been
with the Mets 10 years now.

1103
01:21:36,232 --> 01:21:38,865
It's the same thing every
season... our pitching's weak.

1104
01:21:38,867 --> 01:21:41,401
Our best guy went down
with an elbow injury.

1105
01:21:41,403 --> 01:21:43,738
They had this great
kid coming up, but he...

1106
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:47,574
Well, they decided to trade
him for a left fielder, so...

1107
01:21:47,576 --> 01:21:50,944
Well, that's the thing about trades, huh?

1108
01:21:50,946 --> 01:21:54,282
Everybody has to give up something.

1109
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:56,618
Well, I can tell you where we
are with Marzin, if you want.

1110
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:00,257
Tell me why you're not married anymore.

1111
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,695
Why don't you tell me why you still are?

1112
01:22:08,365 --> 01:22:11,101
Ellis and I understand each other.

1113
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:15,602
You?

1114
01:22:15,604 --> 01:22:18,905
Well, she was, um...

1115
01:22:18,907 --> 01:22:20,908
She was great, actually.

1116
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:23,180
She was kind of a saint.

1117
01:22:25,281 --> 01:22:29,185
There was just one thing about her
that neither one of us could fix.

1118
01:22:30,553 --> 01:22:32,453
What was that?

1119
01:22:32,455 --> 01:22:34,290
She wasn't you.

1120
01:22:40,696 --> 01:22:43,698
Well, you always were a little slow.

1121
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:45,667
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1122
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:49,071
- How's that?
- Why didn't you ask me to come with you?

1123
01:22:50,807 --> 01:22:53,740
And give up second chair?

1124
01:22:53,742 --> 01:22:55,677
No, not you.

1125
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,849
Like I said, slow.

1126
01:23:09,326 --> 01:23:13,026
- What is that?
- Oh, it's just, um...

1127
01:23:13,028 --> 01:23:15,798
Just the office, back home.

1128
01:23:17,032 --> 01:23:19,499
Baseball emergency?

1129
01:23:19,501 --> 01:23:21,935
Yeah, they, uh... They put in
this new surveillance system.

1130
01:23:21,937 --> 01:23:25,972
It's giving everybody fits. I gotta
get to the laptop in the hotel.

1131
01:23:25,974 --> 01:23:28,409
You're really not gonna
tell me where you're going?

1132
01:23:28,411 --> 01:23:30,414
You know what?

1133
01:23:31,915 --> 01:23:34,882
Truth is, it's probably better
I didn't ask you to come with me.

1134
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:38,785
This way, I got to spend the next 13 years

1135
01:23:38,787 --> 01:23:41,888
pretending that you might
have actually said yes.

1136
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:44,226
And I did.

1137
01:23:50,099 --> 01:23:52,135
Good night.

1138
01:23:55,604 --> 01:23:58,705
Would you be careful?

1139
01:23:58,707 --> 01:24:00,409
Be careful, okay?

1140
01:24:14,156 --> 01:24:16,292
Hey. The Mercedes.

1141
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,654
- Where the hell are you?
- I got him, Bump.

1142
01:24:47,656 --> 01:24:50,024
He's in a Benz. We're heading
over the Fourth Street bridge.

1143
01:24:50,026 --> 01:24:52,493
- He made you yet?
- <i>No.</i>

1144
01:24:52,495 --> 01:24:54,462
Looks like he's gonna
take a right on Anderson.

1145
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,131
- <i>Okay. I'm on my way.</i>
- Under the radar, right?

1146
01:24:57,133 --> 01:25:01,735
<i>What, I'm gonna start respecting
protocol now? Break my perfect record?</i>

1147
01:25:01,737 --> 01:25:05,573
<i>Let me look around and
see who I can scare up.</i>

1148
01:25:05,575 --> 01:25:06,807
Okay.

1149
01:25:06,809 --> 01:25:10,778
Brick building, corner
of Anderson and Mateo.

1150
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,512
I'm betting it's a chop shop.

1151
01:25:12,514 --> 01:25:14,515
<i>Hey, don't do anything
till I get there.</i>

1152
01:25:14,517 --> 01:25:16,450
<i>You wind up dead, I get a demerit.</i>

1153
01:26:10,839 --> 01:26:13,507
Hey, man. Hey, yo.

1154
01:26:13,509 --> 01:26:15,976
Let's get it in!

1155
01:26:15,978 --> 01:26:18,044
Ain't no thing!

1156
01:26:18,046 --> 01:26:20,150
Ain't no thing, dog!

1157
01:26:22,684 --> 01:26:27,654
Hey. Asshole.

1158
01:26:30,626 --> 01:26:32,193
Why you following me?

1159
01:26:32,195 --> 01:26:34,294
He's a cop. He's gotta be a cop.

1160
01:26:34,296 --> 01:26:37,297
No badge. He's in a rented car.

1161
01:26:37,299 --> 01:26:39,800
So why's he following you then?

1162
01:26:39,802 --> 01:26:42,002
Nice.

1163
01:26:42,004 --> 01:26:45,507
I said, why are you following me, man?

1164
01:26:46,608 --> 01:26:49,810
Pac-Man, you still don't remember me?

1165
01:26:49,812 --> 01:26:54,282
I'm Pac-Man. I'm in a video game.

1166
01:26:54,284 --> 01:26:56,617
Who the hell is Pac-Man?

1167
01:26:56,619 --> 01:26:59,989
You have to answer for Carolyn
Cobb. You have to answer...

1168
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:05,860
- Yo, can we lose this guy already?
- Yeah, get rid of him. Do it.

1169
01:27:05,862 --> 01:27:07,994
- I don't know who he is.
- Come on. Come on.

1170
01:27:07,996 --> 01:27:12,199
I know it was
you. I know it was you.

1171
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:14,802
- Freeze! Freeze!
- Raise your hands! Get 'em up!

1172
01:27:14,804 --> 01:27:17,704
- Hands up! Nobody do anything stupid!
- Let me see your hands!

1173
01:27:17,706 --> 01:27:19,340
- Get on the ground!
- Drop it!

1174
01:27:19,342 --> 01:27:22,976
- Get down!
- Drop the gun now. Drop it!

1175
01:27:22,978 --> 01:27:25,613
Put it on the ground. That's
it. Slide it over here.

1176
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:27,984
- Bump, you got him?
- Yeah.

1177
01:27:33,889 --> 01:27:37,459
Reggie! Reg, talk to me!

1178
01:27:38,894 --> 01:27:41,061
- Reggie!
- Don't move!

1179
01:27:41,063 --> 01:27:43,932
- Reggie, talk to me!
- I got it, Bump. I got it.

1180
01:27:47,603 --> 01:27:50,236
Come here, buddy. Reggie. Reggie.

1181
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:52,940
Stay with me, buddy. Come
on. Eyes on me, buddy.

1182
01:27:52,942 --> 01:27:55,309
Reggie. Reggie. Come on,
buddy. Eyes on me, buddy.

1183
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:57,078
Shots fired. I have an officer down.

1184
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,846
We are at 516 Anderson
Street in a warehouse.

1185
01:27:59,848 --> 01:28:01,649
- I repeat, officer down.
- Come on, buddy.

1186
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:03,883
- Jess.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

1187
01:28:03,885 --> 01:28:06,654
<i>Officer down, 516 Anderson Street.</i>

1188
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:10,056
Look. It's him.

1189
01:28:10,058 --> 01:28:12,294
It's Marzin.

1190
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:15,930
You see?

1191
01:28:15,932 --> 01:28:17,667
Goddamn it!

1192
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:20,834
How's he doing, Bumpy?

1193
01:28:20,836 --> 01:28:22,336
He's dead.

1194
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,203
I told you I'd get him.

1195
01:28:56,205 --> 01:28:58,107
Congratulations.

1196
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:01,809
You don't think he's Marzin?

1197
01:29:01,811 --> 01:29:04,110
No, I don't think he's Marzin.

1198
01:29:04,112 --> 01:29:07,681
I think we just sent a
15-year guy home in a box

1199
01:29:07,683 --> 01:29:10,150
for five grand theft autos
and a parole violation.

1200
01:29:10,152 --> 01:29:12,986
- You saw his face? Up close?
- Yes, I saw his face.

1201
01:29:12,988 --> 01:29:14,888
Did you look at Siefert's
face? 'Cause he's dead.

1202
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:16,791
Well, he had to answer for Carolyn too.

1203
01:29:16,793 --> 01:29:22,332
Don't you ever, ever say her name again!

1204
01:29:50,058 --> 01:29:52,796
So, what now?

1205
01:29:55,063 --> 01:29:58,966
You fly home? It's done?

1206
01:29:58,968 --> 01:30:03,106
I don't know. Part of it maybe.

1207
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:08,111
I know I should forget it.

1208
01:30:09,178 --> 01:30:11,181
It was another lifetime.

1209
01:30:14,983 --> 01:30:18,120
Except it wasn't.

1210
01:30:19,888 --> 01:30:21,888
We blew it, didn't we?

1211
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,827
Didn't we?

1212
01:30:40,175 --> 01:30:42,278
Sure. Move him in.

1213
01:30:43,545 --> 01:30:46,315
He's been living here for
the last 12 years anyway.

1214
01:30:47,849 --> 01:30:50,720
I'm going to bed.

1215
01:31:03,499 --> 01:31:05,735
I told you he understood me.

1216
01:31:14,043 --> 01:31:16,412
Jess?

1217
01:31:30,326 --> 01:31:33,293
Would, uh, you like any coffee or...

1218
01:31:33,295 --> 01:31:34,994
No. No.

1219
01:31:34,996 --> 01:31:37,332
Have a seat, please.

1220
01:31:39,201 --> 01:31:43,570
My guys are doing a
widows-and-orphans for Siefert.

1221
01:31:43,572 --> 01:31:46,105
Might not be a bad idea
for you to contribute.

1222
01:31:46,107 --> 01:31:48,242
Yeah.

1223
01:31:48,244 --> 01:31:50,180
Of course.

1224
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:52,913
I forgot he was married.

1225
01:31:52,915 --> 01:31:56,553
Divorced. Two kids in high school.

1226
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:00,553
Well, that's on me.

1227
01:32:00,555 --> 01:32:02,556
No.

1228
01:32:02,558 --> 01:32:05,226
It's on me.

1229
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:09,963
I could have stopped all this. That's...

1230
01:32:09,965 --> 01:32:11,935
That's why you're here.

1231
01:32:13,603 --> 01:32:18,504
I want to thank you both for
staying with this like you have,

1232
01:32:18,506 --> 01:32:21,475
but it has to stop now,
before anybody else gets hurt.

1233
01:32:21,477 --> 01:32:24,578
- I couldn't live with that.
- Jess, this is the guy. This is Marzin.

1234
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:27,280
- He's not the guy.
- I know you don't wanna get invested all over again.

1235
01:32:27,282 --> 01:32:28,984
It's not Marzin.

1236
01:32:31,152 --> 01:32:33,887
I know it.

1237
01:32:33,889 --> 01:32:35,658
How?

1238
01:32:38,393 --> 01:32:41,330
'Cause Marzin's been dead for 13 years.

1239
01:32:46,035 --> 01:32:48,771
I killed him.

1240
01:32:53,509 --> 01:32:55,445
What?

1241
01:32:57,345 --> 01:33:01,916
I killed him about a month after you left.

1242
01:33:01,918 --> 01:33:03,953
He's buried out in the yard.

1243
01:33:07,356 --> 01:33:10,591
You understand you're speaking
to an officer of the court?

1244
01:33:10,593 --> 01:33:12,495
- I do.
- Jess.

1245
01:33:14,062 --> 01:33:16,596
Before you say another word, you
need to get yourself a lawyer.

1246
01:33:16,598 --> 01:33:19,836
It's okay. I'll be fine with whatever
you decide to do about it, okay?

1247
01:33:23,004 --> 01:33:25,707
I would've left him alone.
I want you to know that.

1248
01:33:27,242 --> 01:33:29,543
When they torched that van...

1249
01:33:29,545 --> 01:33:32,178
I knew, if Morales could do that,

1250
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:35,615
he would never let us bring this guy in.

1251
01:33:35,617 --> 01:33:37,383
It just...

1252
01:33:37,385 --> 01:33:39,720
It had to be me.

1253
01:33:39,722 --> 01:33:42,959
I owed my daughter that.

1254
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:54,534
<i>Truth is, he
wasn't that hard to find.</i>

1255
01:33:54,536 --> 01:33:58,640
<i>Eventually, he did come to that
bar, like I always said he would.</i>

1256
01:34:06,381 --> 01:34:09,516
<i>Passion always wins.</i>

1257
01:34:09,518 --> 01:34:11,454
<i>Right?</i>

1258
01:34:22,598 --> 01:34:27,534
<i>It's the weirdest thing, when
you're on your way to do something,</i>

1259
01:34:27,536 --> 01:34:31,441
<i>but you're not sure you're
actually gonna go through with it.</i>

1260
01:34:33,642 --> 01:34:38,479
<i>Like reading a book, only you are
the person that you're reading about.</i>

1261
01:34:38,481 --> 01:34:41,748
<i>And then you...</i>

1262
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:44,354
you watch yourself do it.

1263
01:34:56,765 --> 01:34:59,668
Nobody missed him. You
were right about that, Ray.

1264
01:35:04,439 --> 01:35:07,608
<i>We made our case on
Al-Ankara without him.</i>

1265
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:11,079
<i>Got our convictions, and
everybody walked away happy.</i>

1266
01:35:14,316 --> 01:35:16,816
So forget about this Beckwith.

1267
01:35:16,818 --> 01:35:19,520
He's a creep, but he's not our creep.

1268
01:35:19,522 --> 01:35:23,090
Just let it go, okay?

1269
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:26,396
Reliving it, wondering if
you could've stopped it.

1270
01:35:27,463 --> 01:35:29,731
That's no way to live.

1271
01:35:34,536 --> 01:35:36,538
- You're telling me...
- Sorry.

1272
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,676
But it's done.

1273
01:35:45,281 --> 01:35:49,349
- Claire, I'm fine with whatever you...
- I need a second. All right?

1274
01:35:49,351 --> 01:35:53,087
Give me a second.

1275
01:35:55,558 --> 01:35:58,191
Jess.

1276
01:35:58,193 --> 01:36:00,430
Was this better?

1277
01:36:03,232 --> 01:36:05,565
What do you think?

1278
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:08,503
I think you look a million years old.

1279
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:33,327
I always thought if this one was over,

1280
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:36,462
it would feel like it was over.

1281
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,199
Maybe it's been over a long time.

1282
01:36:40,201 --> 01:36:41,802
We just...

1283
01:36:41,804 --> 01:36:44,040
never knew it.

1284
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:48,910
I'm gonna go and check
on her. What do I say?

1285
01:36:50,446 --> 01:36:52,714
I don't know.

1286
01:36:54,415 --> 01:36:56,485
Good night.

1287
01:37:24,245 --> 01:37:26,515
<i>Just let it go, okay?</i>

1288
01:37:28,183 --> 01:37:30,316
<i>Reliving it, wondering if
you could've stopped it...</i>

1289
01:37:32,821 --> 01:37:35,622
That's where I've been the last 13 years.

1290
01:37:35,624 --> 01:37:38,093
<i>That's no way to live.</i>

1291
01:38:12,661 --> 01:38:17,800
Don't you ever, ever say her name again!

1292
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:30,178
<i>It's quiet out
there. I like the quiet.</i>

1293
01:38:36,852 --> 01:38:39,252
Carolyn is...

1294
01:38:39,254 --> 01:38:42,788
<i>was</i> the thing

1295
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:44,827
that made me me.

1296
01:38:46,929 --> 01:38:49,832
<i>What would a few bullets get me?</i>

1297
01:38:51,866 --> 01:38:55,037
Maybe we could go about this
a little less officially.

1298
01:38:58,307 --> 01:39:00,343
I owed my daughter that.

1299
01:39:03,344 --> 01:39:06,147
I don't think I have the stomach
to watch him walk away again.

1300
01:39:11,387 --> 01:39:13,587
That sound like justice to you?

1301
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:22,064
I hate the death penalty.

1302
01:39:26,735 --> 01:39:29,735
<i>Let him rot in jail,</i>

1303
01:39:29,737 --> 01:39:33,943
live a life full of nothing.

1304
01:41:03,031 --> 01:41:04,797
Please.

1305
01:41:04,799 --> 01:41:10,438
Can... Can you ask her to talk to me?

1306
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:23,784
Life sentence, right?

1307
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:26,956
For you too.

1308
01:42:56,111 --> 01:42:58,047
Ray?

1309
01:43:02,217 --> 01:43:04,153
Ray?
