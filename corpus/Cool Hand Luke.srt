1
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,685
What are you doing there, fella?

2
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,148
I just cut these...

3
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,278
You better come along with us.

4
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,216
Taking it off here, Boss?

5
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,718
Yeah, take it off, Dragline.

6
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,063
- Wiping it off here, Boss?
- All right, Koko, wipe it off.

7
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,273
Drinking it up here, Boss?

8
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,526
All right, drink it up, Gambler.

9
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,903
Hey, Rabbitt, water him down.

10
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,376
- All right, break it up!
- Yes, sir!

11
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,435
You eyeballing there, Society?

12
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,229
Checking my yo-yo, Boss.

13
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,534
Drag, new-meat bus.

14
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,459
Bunch. Must be half a dozen new-meat.

15
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,424
- No more than five, for a cold drink.
- You're on.

16
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,136
Babalugats, got a bet here.

17
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,090
All right, you men get lined up here.

18
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,802
Dog Boy, shut them dogs up.

19
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,555
They just smell new-meat, that's all, Boss.

20
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,314
What did they bring us today?

21
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,069
Come on, Blue.

22
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:42,616
"Gibson, 507. Manslaughter."

23
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,368
Good for a two spot.

24
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,870
It was an accident.
I've never been in trouble before.

25
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,205
You call the Captain, "Captain."

26
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,751
"Edgar Potter, 302 and resisting arrest."

27
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,044
"One year."

28
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,630
I was trying to keep in out of the rain.

29
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,509
Get the wax out of your ears.
You call the Captain, "Captain."

30
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,593
Yes, sir.

31
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,595
And you call the rest of us "Boss,"
you hear?

32
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,763
Yes, Boss.

33
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:08,225
This man is going to make us
proud of him, Mr. Hunnicutt.

34
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,311
"Raymond Pratt."

35
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,980
Yes, Captain.

36
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,607
"Breaking, entering, and assault."

37
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,693
Five spot.

38
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,236
And a seaman.

39
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,865
Suspect that should come in real handy
around here, Captain.

40
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,199
Maybe.

41
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,034
"Lucas Jackson."

42
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,369
Here, Captain.

43
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,373
"Maliciously destroying municipal
property while under the influence."

44
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,250
What was that?

45
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,629
Cutting the heads off of parking meters,
Captain.

46
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,217
We ain't never had one of them before.

47
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,678
Where do you think
that's going to get you?

48
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,639
I guess you could say
I wasn't thinking, Captain.

49
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,352
It says here that you did real good
in the war.

50
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,939
A Silver Star, Bronze Star,
couple of Purple Hearts...

51
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,985
Sergeant. Then come out
the same way you went in.

52
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:01,695
Buck Private.

53
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,823
Like I was just passing time, Captain.

54
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,620
Well, you got yourself some time now.
"Two years."

55
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,623
Well, hell, that ain't much.

56
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,542
We got a couple of men here
doing 20 spot.

57
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,086
We got one that's got all of it.

58
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:22,216
We got all kinds,
and you're going to fit in real good.

59
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,886
Of course, in case you get rabbit
in your blood...

60
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:30,557
and you decide to take off for home,
you get a bonus of some time...

61
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,894
and a set of leg chains to keep you
slowed down just a little bit.

62
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,898
For your own good, you'll learn the rules.

63
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,652
It's all up to you.

64
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:47,449
Now, I can be a good guy
or I can be one real mean son of a bitch.

65
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,123
It's all up to you.

66
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,751
All right, let's move it.

67
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,854
One at a time. Move it!

68
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,825
Them clothes got laundry numbers
on them.

69
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,828
You remember your number and always
wear the ones that has your number.

70
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,955
Any man forgets his number
spends a night in the box.

71
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,249
These here spoons you keep with you.

72
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,543
Any man loses his spoon
spends a night in the box.

73
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,795
There's no playing grab-ass
or fighting in the building.

74
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,923
You got a grudge against another man,
you fight him Saturday afternoon.

75
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:48,302
Any man playing grab-ass or fighting
in the building spends a night in the box.

76
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,805
First bell's at five minutes of 8:00
when you will get in your bunk.

77
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,265
Last bell is at 8:00.

78
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,226
Any man not in his bunk at 8:00
spends the night in the box.

79
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,395
There is no smoking
in the prone position in bed.

80
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,148
To smoke you must have both legs
over the side of your bunk.

81
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,358
Any man caught smoking
in the prone position in bed...

82
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,110
spends a night in the box.

83
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,278
You get two sheets.

84
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,655
Every Saturday, you put the clean sheet
on the top...

85
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,823
the top sheet on the bottom...

86
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,700
the bottom sheet you turn in
to the laundry boy.

87
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,328
Any man turns in the wrong sheet
spends a night in the box.

88
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,747
No one'll sit on the bunks
with dirty pants on.

89
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,167
Any man with dirty pants on sitting on
the bunk spends a night in the box.

90
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,378
Any man don't bring back his empty
pop bottle spends a night in the box.

91
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,715
Any man loud talking
spends a night in the box.

92
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,259
You got questions, you come to me.

93
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,597
I'm Carr, the floor walker.
I'm responsible for order in here.

94
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,266
Any man don't keep order
spends a night in...

95
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,601
The box.

96
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,688
I hope you ain't going to be a hard case.

97
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,034
Ain't but four. What did I tell you?
You owe me a cold drink.

98
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,744
I owe you. I owe you.

99
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,747
Move it.

100
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,670
Hey, any of you guys from Connecticut?

101
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,673
Forget it.

102
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,424
Wash them up!

103
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,261
Wash them up!

104
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,721
Move!

105
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:26,191
Well, what are you still doing here?
Get at them beans! Move!

106
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,205
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven.

107
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,667
Next time you stay out of my place.

108
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,044
You try that again and I'll bounce you
all over the floor.

109
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,130
Well, man, I didn't know
it was your special seat.

110
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,007
You don't take another man's seat, man.

111
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,758
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything...

112
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:55,512
You better mind you manners, boy.
You're acting like a hillbilly tramp.

113
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,681
"Tramp." There you go, beauty.

114
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,475
Hey, yeah, man,
you got your bull-gang name now.

115
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,353
Yeah, well, it ain't no worse
than some I been called.

116
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,605
When I was in the Navy...

117
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,939
All you new-meats...

118
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,775
you're going to have to shape up
fast and hard for this gang.

119
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,194
We got rules here.

120
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,361
In order to learn them...

121
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,239
you gotta do more work
with your ears than with your mouth.

122
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,118
Somebody say something?

123
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,245
No, I didn't say nothing, Boss.

124
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,456
What have we got there?

125
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,082
Got a Lucas Jackson.

126
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,587
You don't have a name here
until Dragline gives you one.

127
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:33,383
Maybe we ought to call it "No-Ears."
You don't listen much, do you, boy?

128
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,302
I ain't heard that much worth listening to.

129
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,889
Just a lot of guys laying down
a lot of rules and regulations.

130
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,643
New-meat looks like a poker player, Drag.

131
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,394
Yeah, come on. Bet that eight.

132
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,146
Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me none.

133
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,898
I know you got $5 pocket money.

134
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,818
That would buy you a whole fistful
of cards. You in or out?

135
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,445
Out.

136
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,700
All right, come on.
It's a nickel to you, Drag. Let's go.

137
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,747
- Come on, Drag.
- Dime.

138
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,376
First bell.

139
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,508
All right, break it up.

140
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,263
How'd you get that scar?

141
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,430
What scar?

142
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,684
Last bell.

143
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,102
Last bell.

144
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,759
Fifty, Boss.

145
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,511
Right, Carr. Fifty.

146
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,399
Getting up here, Carr?

147
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,359
Hey, now.

148
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,710
- Twenty-eight.
- Twenty-nine.

149
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,045
- Thirty.
- Thirty-one.

150
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,130
- Thirty-two.
- Thirty-three.

151
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,424
- Thirty-four.
- Thirty-five.

152
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,927
- Twenty-one.
- Twenty-two.

153
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,428
- Twenty-three.
- Twenty-four.

154
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,680
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-six.

155
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,139
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-eight.

156
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,975
- Twenty-nine.
- Thirty.

157
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,060
- Thirty-one.
- Thirty-two.

158
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,062
- Thirty-three.
- Thirty-four.

159
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,356
- Thirty-five.
- Thirty-six.

160
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,777
Get out of my eyeballing seat,
you new-meat dummy.

161
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,604
I'm a salesman. I used to drive
these roads all the time.

162
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,857
Drag, it's going to be
one hot mother today.

163
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:21,153
Yeah, I reckon the bear's going
to be walking the road today.

164
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,363
Then I'm lucky I got me a broom.

165
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:28,076
I work on top, real cush job. I would
hate to be down in that ditch today.

166
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,661
We work in a ditch?

167
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,247
What's the matter with you?

168
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:36,084
All your big-time driving around,
you ain't never seen a chain gang before?

169
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:39,588
I ain't used to hard work, neither.
I always tried to avoid it.

170
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,174
I ain't exactly crazy about it, myself.

171
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,594
Well, man, it's going to be
one tough day to learn on.

172
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:50,098
Now, Koko, why don't you give
one of these new-meat a break...

173
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,850
and let him use your broom today?

174
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:55,270
Oh, hell, Society,
I ain't going down in that ditch.

175
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:58,732
Well, I sure would appreciate it.
I ain't in too good a shape right now.

176
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,485
Hey, Koko, you really
going to sell your job?

177
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,320
Well, Drag, I may have to.

178
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,406
Maybe that Lucas War Hero
would give you your price.

179
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,492
I'll give you 50 cents.

180
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,913
50 cents for a sweet job like that?
That's worth at least a buck.

181
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,248
I'll make it a dollar.

182
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,707
Dollar's a deal.

183
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,214
Where'd you get that about "war hero"?

184
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,216
A little birdie told me.

185
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,218
Tearing the heads off of... What was it?

186
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,803
Gumball machines?

187
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,973
What kind of thing is that
for a grown man?

188
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,436
You know how it is. Small town.
Not much to do in the evening.

189
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,732
Mostly, was just settling an old score.

190
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,668
Boss, I made this arrangement
with this man to take his broom.

191
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,003
Get to work.

192
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:07,634
- You don't understand, I made this deal.
- Get moving.

193
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,678
But I made this arrangement.

194
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,558
Get to work.

195
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,831
Better take it easy.
You won't last two hours.

196
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,711
Taking it off here, Boss?

197
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,755
Yeah, Dragline, take it off there.

198
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,050
- Taking it off here, Boss?
- Yeah, take it off there.

199
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,677
Drinking it up here, Boss?

200
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,903
Man bear-clawed here, Boss!

201
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,052
All right, men.

202
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,887
Let's eat them beans!

203
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,947
Cold drink he don't make it.

204
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,242
You on.

205
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,411
Hey, Babalugats, got a bet here.

206
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,814
- Boss, drinking it up here?
- All right.

207
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,154
Who's that?

208
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,448
That's Godfrey.

209
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,491
The walking boss.

210
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,756
Don't he ever talk?

211
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,179
Think he just said something.

212
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,843
You owe that fella a cold drink.

213
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,693
All right!

214
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,362
You, Gibson, step out.

215
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,700
Boss Paul says you wasn't
happy with your job.

216
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,077
That you was complaining.

217
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:05,080
Well, we're going to give you
a chance to think about it.

218
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:06,331
All right.

219
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,791
Let's go.

220
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,093
Get them clothes off.

221
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,611
First bell.

222
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,244
Plumb busted out. Look like the hard road
finally got to Mr. Lucas War Hero.

223
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,830
I'll be back at it in the morning.
Just need a little nap.

224
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,834
Man, I never thought they'd put him
in the box on his first day.

225
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,086
It was only supposed to be a joke.

226
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,547
There ain't no brooms.

227
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,716
Well, can't expect to learn everything
the first day.

228
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,970
May have taught him
a very valuable lesson.

229
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,599
You guys sure give him all night
to think about it.

230
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:50,727
We can't help it if he's square. Huh, Drag?

231
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:55,148
Of course not. He ain't in the box
because of the joke played on him.

232
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:58,068
He back-sassed a free man.

233
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:02,072
They got their rules and we ain't got
nothing to do with that.

234
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:06,201
Probably happen to him sooner
or later anyway, complainer like him.

235
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:09,788
He's gotta learn the rules,
same as anybody else.

236
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,293
Yeah, them poor old bosses need
all the help they can get.

237
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,712
You trying to say something?

238
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,927
Last bell!

239
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,305
Last bell!

240
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,100
One of these days I'm gonna have to
flap me up some dust with it.

241
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:32,227
Forty-nine and one in the box, Boss.

242
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:35,856
Right, Carr, 49 and one in the box.

243
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,307
Putting them on here, Boss?

244
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,393
You see that, you see that?

245
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:14,811
I got eyes, don't I?

246
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:18,190
How am I not going to see something
that look like that?

247
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:24,071
Man, oh, man, look at that. Look at that!

248
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,998
- Wiping it off here, Boss?
- Wipe it off.

249
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:46,426
- Taking them off here, Boss?
- All right, take it off.

250
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,762
Damn things is blocking the scenery.

251
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:55,143
Oh, man, I'm dying. I'm dying!

252
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:04,027
Nice broad.

253
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,073
Great set.

254
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,543
Lucille, baby.

255
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:32,931
Oh, man, I'm dying! I'm dying!

256
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:40,272
She ain't got nothing but one safety pin
holding that thing on!

257
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:44,735
Come on, safety pin, pop!

258
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,448
Come on, baby, pop!

259
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,702
Hey, Lord...

260
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:57,831
whatever I done, don't strike me blind
for another couple of minutes.

261
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,043
My Lucille.

262
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:06,048
Your Lucille, boy. Where did you get that?

263
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,217
That's Lucille, you mullet-head.

264
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,762
Anything so innocent, and built like that...

265
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,889
just gotta be named Lucille.

266
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,644
Rub it, baby. Clean that car.

267
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,771
Rub, rub...

268
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,469
She doesn't know what she's doing.

269
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,556
Oh, boy, she knows exactly
what she's doing.

270
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,809
She's driving us crazy,
and loving every minute of it!

271
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,937
Shut your mouth about my Lucille.

272
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:18,412
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

273
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:21,206
<i>And on his farm he had a pig</i>

274
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,299
Will you shut up, Babalugats?

275
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:32,050
Why don't you leave him alone?
He's happy.

276
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,302
Because he's a damn moron!

277
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:35,637
Why don't you shut your mouth?

278
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:29,066
- Getting up here, Carr?
- Okay, now.

279
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:34,613
- Getting up, Carr?
- Yeah.

280
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:42,037
Getting up here, Carr?

281
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,998
No. Go up.

282
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,853
Oh, man, that little Lucille.

283
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:10,816
She was really a big lot of little gal,
wasn't she?

284
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:17,197
Did you see how she was just about
popping out of the top of that dress?

285
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,491
Come on, Drag, cut it out.

286
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,743
And down below...

287
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:25,497
man, that thing didn't reach
no higher than...

288
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:32,254
She's liable to catch cold
running around like that.

289
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:37,009
It was stretched so tight
across her bottom...

290
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:41,763
I do believe I saw one of them seams
bust loose.

291
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,558
And the opening got wider...

292
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:49,605
and wider and wider.

293
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:50,939
Forget it, man.

294
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,902
What do you mean, "forget it"?

295
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:59,907
Stop beating it into the ground.
You ain't doing nobody no good.

296
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,745
Okay, new-meat. You get some sleep.

297
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:09,291
And save your strength,
'cause you're going to need it.

298
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,711
Tomorrow.

299
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:48,622
Hit him! Hit him!

300
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:07,891
Hey, go get him.

301
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:10,060
- Nice shot, Drag.
- Stay away from him.

302
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,482
He's still got a chance.

303
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,869
It's a big one.

304
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,502
Come on, Lucas!

305
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:47,139
Why don't you just stay down, Luke?

306
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:49,141
He's just going to knock you down again,
buddy.

307
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,143
It's not your fault. He's just too big.

308
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,437
Let him hit you in the nose
and get some blood flowing.

309
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:55,647
Maybe the bosses will stop it
before he kills you.

310
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,232
I don't want to frighten him.

311
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:58,859
Stay down, Luke.

312
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:05,032
Stay down, Luke. He's gonna kill you.

313
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,408
Stay down!

314
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,929
Somebody ought to stop this thing.

315
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:51,847
Stay down.

316
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,891
You're beat!

317
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,519
You're going to have to kill me.

318
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:09,132
All right, pot's right. Here we go.

319
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:13,971
King gets a three, queen, deuce,
seven, pair of savannahs right here.

320
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:17,474
Deuce gets a four. No help.
Three gets a big ace.

321
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,767
Bet to the savannahs.

322
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,227
Pewter.

323
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,731
I call.

324
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,327
Kick a buck.

325
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:39,037
A dollar?

326
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,667
One time.

327
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:45,669
All right, I call.

328
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:49,089
Hell, if I catch, I'm gonna burn you. I call.

329
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:52,217
King, three, you got a four,
queen, deuce, gets a five...

330
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,052
and a pair of sevens gets a john.

331
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:57,806
And the big ace gets... slop in the face.

332
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:00,976
Okay, you still do the talking.

333
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:03,145
Pewter again.

334
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:04,855
I call.

335
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,526
Kick a buck.

336
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:13,697
- What you got?
- Pair of sevens.

337
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,159
I can see that, mullet-head.
What have you got in the hole?

338
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:21,622
He ain't got nothing showing.
Raise his head off.

339
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:22,789
He's been betting...

340
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,042
All right, then you just call it.

341
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:26,919
I call.

342
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:29,087
You've got to see it, Gambler.

343
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:31,215
I can't. I can't catch a damn thing...

344
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:34,259
I'm snake-bit. I can't catch. I fold.

345
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:38,805
King, four, three. You got a nine.
Nothing visible.

346
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:41,767
Pair of sevens and a jack gets a six.

347
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,061
Savannas, you is still a better man.

348
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:47,397
Pewter.

349
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:52,820
Kick a buck.

350
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:54,905
Kick him back a buck!

351
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:57,533
I'll see your buck and back a buck.

352
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:00,786
Kick a buck.

353
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:01,995
Damn!

354
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,664
Don't look at me, mullet-head.

355
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:06,583
Come on.

356
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:10,170
What're you going to do,
play like a coconut? You got to call him.

357
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:13,423
I know he's got a pair of kings.
You don't have to stuff them up my nose.

358
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:15,217
Well, you still got to call him, anyway.

359
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,261
You gotta look at them.

360
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,805
The man's got kings. Get your tail out.

361
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,397
You want to see them? Right there.
One, two, three, four, five.

362
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:34,111
Nothing. A handful of nothing.

363
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,947
You stupid mullet-head,
he beat you with nothing.

364
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:41,160
Just like today when he kept
coming back at me... with nothing.

365
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:48,834
Sometimes nothing
can be a real cool hand.

366
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,172
Move over.

367
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:56,175
I'm going to sit in here, next to my boy.

368
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:00,095
Cool Hand Luke.

369
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:04,766
Deal.

370
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:08,770
I'm in this next one.

371
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,079
Hey, Loudmouth!

372
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:30,125
Come on, get out there.
Your mama's waiting for you.

373
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,213
She never leaves me alone!

374
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:36,757
Be glad you got somebody, kid.

375
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:39,384
Luke, visitor for you.

376
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:54,775
- Son.
- Come on, Ma.

377
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,402
<i>Just a closer walk with Thee</i>

378
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:05,285
<i>Grant it, Jesus, is my plea</i>

379
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:13,502
<i>Daily walkin' close to Thee</i>

380
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:16,547
- Coming out here, Boss?
- Come on out, Luke.

381
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:20,384
<i>Let it be, dear Lord</i>

382
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:22,886
<i>Let it be</i>

383
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:30,936
<i>Through the days of toil that's near</i>

384
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:38,110
<i>If I fall, dear Lord, who cares?</i>

385
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:47,286
<i>Who but Thee my burden shares?</i>

386
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:53,125
<i>None but Thee, dear Lord</i>

387
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,752
<i>None but Thee</i>

388
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:09,600
How did you find me?

389
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:12,644
That Helen...

390
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:15,189
she sent your things along with a note...

391
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:19,401
and then John here,
he wrote to the police.

392
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,533
Move around here, Boss?

393
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,956
Well, Arletta, I've got to stay here.

394
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:39,004
I always hoped to see you well-fixed...

395
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:43,675
have me a crop of grandkids
to fuss around with.

396
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,429
I'd like to oblige you, Arletta, but...

397
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:50,974
right off, I just don't know
where to put my hands on them.

398
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,479
You know, sometimes...

399
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:58,982
I wish people was like dogs, Luke.

400
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:04,905
Comes a time, a day like, when...

401
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:10,077
the bitch just don't recognize
the pups no more, so...

402
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:16,291
she don't have no hopes,
nor love, to give her pain.

403
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,921
She just don't give a damn.

404
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:27,803
They letting you smoke here?

405
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,638
Smoking up here, Boss?

406
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:40,065
You've done your best, Arletta.

407
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,279
What I've done with myself
is my own problem.

408
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:49,199
Oh, no, it ain't, Luke. You ain't alone.

409
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:52,077
Everywhere you go, I'm with you.

410
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:54,580
And John, too.

411
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:59,918
You never thought maybe
that's a heavy load?

412
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:06,258
Why, we always thought you
were strong enough to carry it.

413
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,595
Was we wrong?

414
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:11,096
I don't know.

415
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,267
Well, things are just never the way...

416
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,727
they seem, Arletta, you know that.

417
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,645
A man's gotta go his own way.

418
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:20,522
Guess, I've just got to...

419
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:24,234
got to love you and let go.

420
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,779
I guess.

421
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:34,328
I ain't asking what you're going to do
when you get out, because...

422
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:36,455
I'll be dead and it don't matter.

423
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,461
You never did want to live forever.

424
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:45,005
I mean, it wasn't such a hell of a life.

425
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:49,259
I had me some high old times.

426
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,553
Your old man, Luke...

427
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:55,140
he wasn't much good
for sticking around...

428
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:57,935
but, damn it, he made me laugh.

429
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:04,775
I would have liked to have known him,
the way you talk about him.

430
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:17,120
He'd have broke you up.

431
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:32,135
- Luke?
- Yeah, Mamma?

432
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:35,681
What went wrong?

433
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:38,725
- Nothing. Everything's cool as can be.
- No.

434
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:43,021
Arletta, I tried.

435
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:45,482
I mean, to...

436
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:50,362
live always free and above board
like you, but...

437
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:54,324
I don't know, I just can't seem
to find no elbow room.

438
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,747
You always had good jobs.

439
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:05,002
And that girl in Kentucky...

440
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:08,922
Oh. I'd taken a shine to her.

441
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:12,593
She sure took off
with that convertible fella.

442
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:14,261
Well, why not?

443
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:19,975
Idea of marrying got you all,
all bollixed up.

444
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:24,313
Trying to be respectable.

445
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:29,109
You was boring the hell out of all of us.

446
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:40,537
I'm leaving the place to John.

447
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:42,456
That's good. He earned it.

448
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,708
Ain't nothing to do with it.

449
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:49,963
I just never give John...

450
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:55,135
the kind of, you know,
feeling that I give you.

451
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:59,056
So, I'm going to pay him back now.

452
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:03,519
Don't feel you have to say anything.

453
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,982
The way it is, you see...

454
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:18,826
sometimes you just
have a feeling for a child...

455
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:22,329
or else you don't.

456
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:25,833
With John, I just didn't.

457
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:33,799
I gotta go, Arletta.

458
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:38,595
Laugh it up, kid. You, you'll make out.

459
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:52,901
Uncle Luke, why can't you have chains?

460
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:56,697
John-Boy, let me tell you something.

461
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,617
You know, them chains ain't medals.
You get them for making mistakes.

462
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,455
And you make a bad enough mistake,
then you've got to deal with the Man.

463
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:07,332
He is one rough old boy.

464
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,709
Okay?

465
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:24,224
So long, Arletta. Take care.

466
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,310
You know it, kid.

467
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:33,400
Now there ain't nothing to come back for.

468
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:45,120
<i>Just a closer walk with Thee</i>

469
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:53,295
<i>Grant it, Jesus, is my plea</i>

470
00:45:56,173 --> 00:46:01,303
<i>Daily walking close to Thee</i>

471
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:08,060
<i>Let it be, dear Lord</i>

472
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:12,105
<i>Let it be</i>

473
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:18,445
<i>Through the days of toil that's near</i>

474
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:25,786
<i>If I fall, dear Lord, who cares?</i>

475
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:32,167
<i>Who but Thee</i>

476
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:36,672
<i>My burden shares?</i>

477
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:40,676
<i>None but Thee, dear Lord</i>

478
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:44,972
<i>None but Thee</i>

479
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:06,827
All right.

480
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:10,664
This gang's been doing so good...

481
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:15,169
the Captain decided
to give you something special.

482
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:20,340
You've got yourselves
a whole road of tarring to do.

483
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:24,595
And I want to see you roll it.

484
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:31,935
Pick up your shovels.

485
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:34,104
Get with it. Move!

486
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:39,693
The bear's sure going to be walking
the road today.

487
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:41,028
What's the deal?

488
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:45,532
Man, you think you been working hard?
This mother's going to break your back.

489
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:28,909
Let's roll! Let's see those shovels!

490
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:32,830
All right, roll it!

491
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:37,584
I'm gonna twist my arm off
if this heat don't kill me first. Right, Boss.

492
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:48,136
Hey, buddy, slow down.

493
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:50,389
That's a long road.

494
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:56,103
Well, the Man wants speed,
let's just give it to him.

495
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,649
Cram it in and break it off. Go hard.

496
00:49:02,401 --> 00:49:04,153
What are we racing for?

497
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:08,198
Wants speed, let's give it to him.

498
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:11,952
Use that shovel like it was your spoon.
Shag it, man.

499
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,926
The Man, boy, get the Man!

500
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:30,053
Moving it up here, Boss?

501
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,803
Now you tell me, Rabbitt,
what's going on here?

502
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:15,557
I don't know, Boss.
I think they're all bear-clawed.

503
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:25,108
They don't know whether to smile,
spit, or swallow.

504
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:28,612
Well, they've never seen
a bull gang before.

505
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,314
Where'd the road go?

506
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:49,026
That's it. That's the end of it.

507
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:51,361
Man, there's still daylight.

508
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:53,197
About two hours left.

509
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,408
What do we do now?

510
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:58,952
Nothing.

511
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:03,457
Oh, Luke, you wild, beautiful thing!

512
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:06,627
You crazy handful of nothing!

513
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:30,108
"As Carol pressed her lips to him...

514
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:34,488
"his right hand started a slow
descent down her silken body.

515
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:38,909
"Desire and fear, temptation and terror...

516
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:43,539
"yearning and horror warred
within her beautiful young body."

517
00:52:45,874 --> 00:52:47,793
They have to close those things,
or we'll drown...

518
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,587
but it sure is suffocating in here.

519
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,548
Talk about drowning.

520
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:55,050
When I was in the Navy...

521
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:58,095
I was on submarine duty once,
and when you get down there...

522
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:01,473
Will you tell your story walking?
It's too hot.

523
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:13,777
Did you see my skinny little boy
chow tonight?

524
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:16,029
He's matching you plate for plate.

525
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:19,575
I wasn't feeling good.
I think I got an ulcer or something.

526
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:23,871
He had a bigger spoon.
Made you look like yours had a hole in it.

527
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:25,205
Come on, Clarence.

528
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,875
What do you mean, "Clarence"?
You calling me a liar?

529
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,126
No, not a liar.

530
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:33,130
You just have a common and
likeable tendency toward exaggeration.

531
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:38,886
That there's the champion hog-gutter
of this camp.

532
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,264
Hell, I've seen him eat
ten chocolate bars...

533
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:45,184
and seven cold drinks in 15 minutes.

534
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:50,481
He can eat busted bottles and rusty nails,
any damn thing.

535
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:54,735
If you be so kind to let me cut off
your Yankee head, he'll even eat that.

536
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:57,696
I can eat 50 eggs.

537
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:04,161
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

538
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,829
You just said he could eat anything.

539
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:07,164
You ever eat 50 eggs?

540
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:09,333
Nobody ever ate 50 eggs.

541
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:11,668
Hey, Babalugats! We got a bet here.

542
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:14,922
My boy says he can eat 50 eggs,
he can eat 50 eggs.

543
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:16,632
Yeah, but in how long?

544
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:18,967
In an hour.

545
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:21,345
Well, I believe I'll take part of that wager.

546
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:22,763
$2. Right here. I'm going to Koko.

547
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:24,389
Come on now, let's talk some money.

548
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:26,391
All right, $20. Anything.

549
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:28,769
The syndicate will cover any kind of bet
you want to make.

550
00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:29,978
Koko, get some paper.

551
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:33,524
Drag, 50 eggs got to weigh
a good 6 pounds.

552
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:36,443
Man's gut can't hold that.
They'll swell up and bust him open.

553
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:37,528
You gonna kill him.

554
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:40,614
All right, get your money up. Now,
Gambler, Dynamite, come on, get it up.

555
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:43,826
Coconut-head's going to take all the
money. Come on, Loudmouth, get it up.

556
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:45,744
Wait just a minute, now.
How's he gonna eat them?

557
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:48,372
Boiled for 15 minutes.
Eat the whole thing in an hour.

558
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:50,916
One rule. No throwing up.

559
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:53,460
He throws up, you forfeit everything.

560
00:54:53,794 --> 00:54:56,713
Now when was the last time
you ever saw my boy throw up?

561
00:54:56,797 --> 00:54:59,341
Now shut your mouth
and give your money to Koko.

562
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:02,177
Come on, now. Right over here.

563
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:08,141
Luke, what did you have to say 50 for?

564
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:11,854
Why couldn't you say 35 or 39?

565
00:55:11,937 --> 00:55:13,939
It seemed a nice round number.

566
00:55:14,148 --> 00:55:17,651
That's money you're talking about.
What's the matter with you?

567
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:21,196
Yeah, well, it'll be something to do.

568
00:55:26,952 --> 00:55:29,079
- Ten!
- Ten, right!

569
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:34,293
What did I do?

570
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:38,505
I stole and I told lies.

571
00:55:39,298 --> 00:55:40,549
Keep your left up.

572
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:43,844
- But I love my neighbor.
- And his wife.

573
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:45,929
He'll never make it.

574
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:48,390
Wait a second.

575
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:52,269
What we've got to do is stretch
that little old belly of yours.

576
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:53,437
Do it, man.

577
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,899
Get all this stuff out of the way
of them eggs coming down.

578
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:58,150
What do you think?

579
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:02,779
We've got to get it all in fighting shape,
like a barrage balloon.

580
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:08,702
Ready?

581
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:10,496
And go!

582
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:25,219
Hey, Boss, man needs a brown bomber
and a dose of salts.

583
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:27,721
Nobody said nothing about that.

584
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:33,894
You can't do that!

585
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:39,274
- I want my money back.
- No money back.

586
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:52,996
Twenty of those pills still won't
make any difference. Go ahead.

587
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,040
What are you worried about?
He can't do it.

588
00:56:55,123 --> 00:56:56,291
Do we get our money?

589
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:57,876
What's he doing?

590
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:35,831
Here comes his eggs.

591
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:39,751
All right, stand back, you pedestrians.
This ain't no automobile accident.

592
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:40,919
Is that all 50 of them?

593
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:43,755
Move over, losers.
I got money riding on it.

594
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:47,009
All right, I've got it figured out.

595
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:50,554
If he eats an egg a minute,
he's got 10 minutes left to swallow them.

596
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:53,599
Hey, I was just sent $5 from a rodeo outfit.

597
00:57:53,682 --> 00:57:55,684
- What for? Well, you gonna bet it?
- Last bull I fell off of.

598
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:58,896
- Hey, you're peeling his eggs!
- That's right, Mr. Alibi.

599
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:01,356
He peels his eggs himself.
That's understood.

600
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,193
Now you may be just great
at hanging paper around the big city...

601
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:05,527
and passing bad checks...

602
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:07,821
but us country boys
ain't entirely brainless.

603
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:10,949
When it comes to the law,
nothing is understood.

604
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:13,452
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

605
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:16,455
Who made what law
about peeling the eggs?

606
00:58:16,538 --> 00:58:19,708
I'm his trainer.
I'm the syndicate covering all bets.

607
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:22,628
And I'm his official egg-peeler.
That's the law.

608
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:29,968
Just wait till the hour starts, that's all.

609
00:58:30,052 --> 00:58:32,262
I was banking on the fact
that he had to peel them.

610
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:33,597
First it was the salt...

611
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:35,891
What's going on?

612
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:42,272
All right.

613
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:47,069
You ready, champ?

614
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:53,700
Ready?

615
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:56,620
Go!

616
00:58:57,746 --> 00:58:58,747
One...

617
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:01,250
two...

618
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,085
three...

619
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:06,338
Man, he's going to lose a finger
eating eggs like that.

620
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,931
Twenty-four...

621
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:22,813
twenty-five...

622
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:24,398
Slow down a little.

623
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:30,195
Twenty-six...

624
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:35,075
Forget it, he's wasting time.

625
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:37,619
What's the exercise,
is that part of the rules?

626
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:40,581
You better forget about it.

627
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:54,887
Thirty-two.

628
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:01,894
Still got 18 more to go...

629
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:03,103
What's wrong?

630
01:00:03,187 --> 01:00:05,063
- I think he's gonna throw up!
- Oh, no.

631
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:06,773
- That's it.
- He's finished.

632
01:00:06,857 --> 01:00:08,692
- Come on, Luke!
- Eighteen to go.

633
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:09,776
Hey, you'll feel better.

634
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:12,112
He's finished.

635
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,458
Just like a ripe watermelon
that's about to bust itself open.

636
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:27,211
Your boy's done for, Drag.
I'm putting in my last penny.

637
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:30,797
- It don't look good, Drag.
- Man's gut can't hold more than that.

638
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:44,353
- He's all right, he's all right.
- He's going to make himself sick.

639
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:52,152
- He's all right.
- Attaboy.

640
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:58,200
I give you a dollar, he don't eat all 50 eggs,
I get $2 back.

641
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,285
Fixer, you is a sweet old boy.

642
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:04,248
You better take that dollar and buy
yourself a new spark plug or something.

643
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:06,875
But as long as you done took a stand...

644
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:10,128
why don't you put some money where
your mouth is and not no measly buck!

645
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:11,922
Well, all I got is $3.75, Drag.

646
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:13,257
That's a bet, Koko.

647
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:16,844
All right, now, the rest of you,
I want to hear from some big-money men.

648
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,554
Where's all the high rollers?

649
01:01:18,637 --> 01:01:22,975
I believe you've got it all, Dragline.
Every cent in camp is riding.

650
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:34,987
Thirty-three.

651
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,615
- What's the time?
- Come on, baby.

652
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:41,410
Twenty-four minutes to go.

653
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:45,831
Just let that little old belly sag
and enjoy itself.

654
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:48,167
Thirty-nine.

655
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,252
Going down into the cage.

656
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:53,338
Twenty-four minutes. He'll never make it.

657
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,012
Forty-one.

658
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:05,058
Stay loose, buddy. Just nine more
between you and everlasting glory.

659
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:06,310
Is he eating them, Alibi?

660
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:09,146
He's chewing. Look at that.

661
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:12,316
They're pigeon eggs, that's all.
Fish eggs, practically.

662
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:13,775
How much more time, Carr?

663
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,694
Six minutes to go, Stevie.

664
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:18,363
Chew, chew, chew!

665
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:19,531
You're helping him chew now!

666
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:21,283
I'm not.

667
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:25,579
- Forty-two.
- He's not spitting them out.

668
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:28,790
Tiny, tiny egg.

669
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,381
Two minutes to time!

670
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:46,099
Forty-four.

671
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:49,394
All right, now,
get mad at them damned eggs.

672
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:50,771
Eat them down, boy.

673
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:51,897
Chew on it.

674
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:53,190
Gnaw on it.

675
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:00,280
Thirty seconds.

676
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:02,533
You got the last one.

677
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:05,494
Stuff it down in there. Get it in.

678
01:03:05,577 --> 01:03:09,248
That's the last one in there now, baby.
Chew. Chew.

679
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:11,458
He's got to swallow it all
before the time's up.

680
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:14,753
Ten, nine, eight...

681
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:17,840
seven, six, five...

682
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:21,385
four, three, two...

683
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:23,846
one, zero!

684
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:28,976
Hold it! He didn't swallow the last.

685
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:32,312
You think so? Just take a look here.

686
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:33,897
Open that mouth.

687
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:52,124
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

688
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:13,187
Snake in the grass here, Boss!

689
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:14,688
Get it.

690
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:16,023
Get it!

691
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:22,488
Pick it up here, Boss?

692
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:33,916
Hey, Boss?

693
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:36,418
Forgot your walking stick.

694
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,390
Man, you sure can shoot.

695
01:04:58,524 --> 01:05:01,777
You've gone too far when
you mess with the Man With No Eyes.

696
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,237
You'll be out of here in a little bit.

697
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,572
Why don't you take it a little easy?

698
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:27,928
All right, everybody in the trucks.

699
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:39,481
Boy, look at him go! Bam! Bam!

700
01:05:39,565 --> 01:05:43,569
Just knock it off, Luke!
You can't talk about him that way.

701
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:46,446
You still believe in
that big bearded boss up there?

702
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:47,781
You think he's watching us?

703
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:49,241
Get in here!

704
01:05:49,616 --> 01:05:51,076
Aren't you scared?

705
01:05:52,077 --> 01:05:53,704
Aren't you scared of dying?

706
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:56,874
Dying? Boy, he can have this
little life anytime he wants to.

707
01:05:56,957 --> 01:05:58,876
You hear that? You hear it?

708
01:05:59,918 --> 01:06:03,297
Come on! You're welcome to it, old timer.

709
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:05,716
Let me know you're up there. Come on.

710
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:09,094
Love me, hate me, kill me, anything.
Just let me know it.

711
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:15,684
Just standing in the rain...

712
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:17,227
talking to myself.

713
01:06:22,649 --> 01:06:26,570
Blind Dick is paying back three
and borrowing five.

714
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:27,738
Next.

715
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:29,198
You borrowing or paying back?

716
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:30,699
Borrowing.

717
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:34,536
Well, Mr. Cool Hand here is the soft heart
in our loan department.

718
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:36,955
I just need five, Luke.

719
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:42,169
I knew you could really eat all them eggs.

720
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:44,087
Yeah, well, I didn't.

721
01:06:47,216 --> 01:06:50,302
That's my darling Luke.
He grins like a baby...

722
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:53,347
but he bites like a gator. Next.

723
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:54,973
I believe I still owe the 30.

724
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:57,684
I don't suppose you'd care to take a check?

725
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:02,105
Luke.

726
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:06,819
Sorry.

727
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:27,798
His mother's dead.

728
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:23,979
<i>I don't care if it rains or freezes</i>

729
01:08:24,104 --> 01:08:28,400
<i>As long as I got my plastic Jesus</i>

730
01:08:28,484 --> 01:08:33,071
<i>Sitting on the dashboard of my car</i>

731
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:41,079
<i>Comes in colors pink and pleasant</i>

732
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:44,833
<i>Glows in the dark 'cause it's iridescent</i>

733
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:47,878
<i>Take it with you</i>

734
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:52,090
<i>When you travel far</i>

735
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:59,348
<i>Get yourself a sweet Madonna</i>

736
01:08:59,431 --> 01:09:02,935
<i>Dressed in rhinestone sitting on</i>

737
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:08,732
<i>A pedestal of abalone shell</i>

738
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:15,739
<i>Going 90, I ain't scary</i>

739
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:19,660
<i>'Cause I got the Virgin Mary</i>

740
01:09:19,785 --> 01:09:21,787
<i>Assuring me</i>

741
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:25,290
<i>That I won't go to hell</i>

742
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:34,925
<i>Get yourself a sweet Madonna</i>

743
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:38,011
<i>Dressed in rhinestone sitting on</i>

744
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:43,016
<i>A pedestal of abalone shell</i>

745
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:47,312
<i>Going 90, I ain't scary</i>

746
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:50,023
<i>'Cause I got the Virgin Mary</i>

747
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:51,567
<i>Assuring me</i>

748
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:54,903
<i>That I won't go to hell</i>

749
01:10:15,007 --> 01:10:16,341
Luke, fall out.

750
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:28,604
When a man's mother dies...

751
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:32,983
and he gets to thinking about
her funeral and paying respects...

752
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:36,862
before he knows it, his mind ain't right.

753
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:40,491
He's got rabbit in his blood and he runs.

754
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,328
We're keeping you off the road for a while.

755
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:53,837
I'm going to say a prayer
for your ma, Luke.

756
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:38,966
Sorry, Luke, I'm just doing my job.
You've got to appreciate that.

757
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,971
Calling it your job
don't make it right, Boss.

758
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:55,232
Twenty-one.

759
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:56,859
- Twenty-two.
- Twenty-three.

760
01:11:56,942 --> 01:11:58,944
- Twenty-four.
- Twenty-five.

761
01:11:59,194 --> 01:12:02,239
- Twenty-six.
- Twenty-seven.

762
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:04,199
- Twenty-eight.
- Twenty-nine.

763
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:05,909
- Thirty.
- Thirty-one.

764
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:12,166
- Moving it up here, Boss?
- Move it up.

765
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:38,817
Four.

766
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:40,652
Five.

767
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:43,489
- Six.
- Seven.

768
01:12:43,572 --> 01:12:44,990
- Eight.
- Nine.

769
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:46,992
- Ten.
- Eleven.

770
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:48,577
- Twelve.
- Thirteen.

771
01:13:05,177 --> 01:13:08,263
Your ma's in the ground now,
God rest her soul.

772
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,725
You best forget about it, Luke.

773
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:15,854
Got a day and a half lay-in.
Tomorrow's a holiday.

774
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:11,118
- Happy Fourth of July!
- Same to you!

775
01:14:56,497 --> 01:15:00,000
Break it up. Come on, you had your fun.

776
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:03,003
First bell! Move it, Stevie.

777
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:06,423
Hey, Carr. Come here.

778
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:11,011
What have you got,
another one of them dirty books, Drag?

779
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:14,973
Do yourself a favor. Read this part
that Koko underlined for me.

780
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:21,146
"She moved her head another inch
while he reached up...

781
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:24,858
"and put his left hand on Carol's...

782
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:27,945
"As Carol pressed her..."

783
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:30,072
Oh, I can't stand it!

784
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:34,618
You're just coming to
the interesting part now.

785
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:36,286
Yeah, go ahead.

786
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:50,884
- I can't hear you.
- "Her trembling body...

787
01:15:50,968 --> 01:15:54,012
"shivered under his..."

788
01:15:54,721 --> 01:15:57,015
All right!

789
01:15:57,683 --> 01:16:00,519
Last bell. Last bell.

790
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:04,565
- Move it.
- Hey, Carr.

791
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:06,817
What's that noise outside?

792
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:12,614
Man on the fence, Boss!

793
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:20,038
Hit him!

794
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:26,962
Wait a minute! Damn it!

795
01:16:27,087 --> 01:16:29,631
Blue, come back here! Damn it!

796
01:16:34,678 --> 01:16:38,015
Forty-eight, Boss.
One in the box and one in the bush.

797
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:41,477
Forty-eight. One in the box
and one in the bush.

798
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:06,752
Oh, listen to Blue sing!

799
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,507
He's onto him, he says. He's got him.

800
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,550
Hell, that dog's running around in circles.

801
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:15,093
No, he's onto him.

802
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:18,639
Captain says for us to wait
till the patrol gets here.

803
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:20,516
Should've waited for me to get him out.

804
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:22,601
Loose like that he can run him crazy.

805
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:25,854
Didn't even have enough sense
to run from the road like everybody else.

806
01:17:25,938 --> 01:17:28,732
Oh, I'm beat. This ain't my job nohow.

807
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:29,960
Your dogs are crazy.

808
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:31,587
He's crossed it.

809
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:34,631
He's smarter than I thought. Let's go!

810
01:21:12,706 --> 01:21:14,082
He made it!

811
01:21:16,627 --> 01:21:17,794
Look, Captain!

812
01:21:18,962 --> 01:21:20,756
Look what he done to Blue.

813
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:23,050
He's dead.

814
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:28,263
He run himself plumb to death.

815
01:21:57,876 --> 01:21:59,670
Mr. Hunnicutt.

816
01:22:02,506 --> 01:22:04,675
Get in line facing the Captain.

817
01:22:48,427 --> 01:22:52,347
You're going to get used to wearing
them chains after a while, Luke...

818
01:22:52,431 --> 01:22:55,476
but you'll never stop listening
to them clinking.

819
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:00,063
'Cause they're going to remind you
of what I've been saying...

820
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:02,816
for your own good.

821
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:06,111
Wish you'd stop being so good
to me, Captain.

822
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:12,743
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

823
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:14,661
Never!

824
01:23:14,745 --> 01:23:16,079
Never!

825
01:23:23,045 --> 01:23:25,714
What we've got here is...

826
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:29,051
failure to communicate.

827
01:23:29,927 --> 01:23:33,430
Some men you just can't reach.

828
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:38,769
So you get what we had here last week,
which is the way he wants it.

829
01:23:39,269 --> 01:23:40,979
Well, he gets it.

830
01:23:43,607 --> 01:23:47,277
I don't like it anymore than you men.

831
01:23:56,161 --> 01:23:58,539
Well, lookie here.

832
01:23:59,498 --> 01:24:01,124
I knew they'd get you.

833
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,460
Them chains and a bonus
of a couple of years...

834
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:06,380
Your running days are over forever, boy.

835
01:24:06,922 --> 01:24:09,550
Hell, I'd like to see you try to run again.

836
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:13,887
You know, you getting so you smell
so bad, I can track you myself.

837
01:24:15,514 --> 01:24:18,934
Yeah, well, that ought to be easy
for a genuine son of a bitch.

838
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:32,948
Tell us what happened.
How far did you get?

839
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:34,741
Shut up and let him eat.

840
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:36,869
About a mile and a half.

841
01:24:39,663 --> 01:24:41,081
This supermarket parking lot.

842
01:24:41,165 --> 01:24:43,417
Found a car with keys in the ignition.

843
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,879
Hit this red light and this police car
slides up alongside.

844
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:51,133
Then what did you do?

845
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:53,927
Waited for that light to change.

846
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:58,265
This cop kept looking over, wondering
what somebody that looks like me...

847
01:24:58,348 --> 01:25:01,935
dressed in state issue,
was doing driving a shiny new buggy.

848
01:25:03,896 --> 01:25:05,731
So what did he do?

849
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:08,734
He leaned over and said, "Hey!"

850
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,154
Topflight police work,
that's all there is to it.

851
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:14,615
Fella's probably a lieutenant by now.

852
01:25:21,705 --> 01:25:24,583
Now, we're just gonna lay low
and build time.

853
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:27,711
Before you know it,
the heat's going to be off of you.

854
01:25:27,794 --> 01:25:31,423
Everything will be right back where it was.
Right, sweet buddy?

855
01:25:44,102 --> 01:25:46,814
I hear tell you don't believe
in no God, Luke.

856
01:25:47,606 --> 01:25:50,692
I was wondering how come a nice,
clean-cut young fellow like you...

857
01:25:50,776 --> 01:25:52,986
gets to be put on the hard road.

858
01:25:54,112 --> 01:25:55,697
Now I reckon I knows.

859
01:25:57,115 --> 01:26:01,036
I've been on the road gang
almost 22 years.

860
01:26:01,787 --> 01:26:04,873
In all that time,
I ain't never killed no white man...

861
01:26:05,749 --> 01:26:07,835
but I ain't afraid to because...

862
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:11,046
Excuse me, Boss, don't mean to interrupt.
Caught short here.

863
01:26:11,129 --> 01:26:13,257
It's all right. It's okay.

864
01:26:13,924 --> 01:26:16,468
You just go on out there
behind them trees.

865
01:26:16,927 --> 01:26:19,388
A man's gotta have his privacy sometime.

866
01:26:20,013 --> 01:26:23,308
You just keep shaking that bush
so we know you're there.

867
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:25,394
Just keep shaking that bush.

868
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:27,020
Yes, Boss.

869
01:26:53,672 --> 01:26:56,133
Shaking it up here, Boss!

870
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:01,180
Still shaking it, Boss.

871
01:27:04,475 --> 01:27:06,185
I'm shaking it, Boss.

872
01:27:27,664 --> 01:27:28,832
Damn!

873
01:27:30,334 --> 01:27:32,085
He's gone. Get the dogs.

874
01:28:31,645 --> 01:28:33,355
What you got them on for?

875
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:35,649
How do you take your pants off?

876
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:39,570
Best way is to get rid of them leg irons...

877
01:28:40,571 --> 01:28:41,822
but you ain't strong enough.

878
01:28:41,905 --> 01:28:43,615
Strong enough for what?

879
01:28:45,576 --> 01:28:47,119
Hell, you couldn't heft an axe.

880
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:48,453
Can, too.

881
01:28:48,579 --> 01:28:49,663
- I bet you can't.
- Can, too.

882
01:28:49,746 --> 01:28:51,498
- Bet you can't.
- Can, too.

883
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:56,128
Well, then go get it, man.

884
01:29:02,259 --> 01:29:03,427
What's your name, boy?

885
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,511
Ben.

886
01:29:05,929 --> 01:29:09,057
Aren't you going to take
those stripes off your pants?

887
01:29:09,808 --> 01:29:11,226
You know it, kid.

888
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:28,202
- You want to see something real funny?
- Yeah?

889
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:30,454
Well, you go on in there and you get me...

890
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:33,874
chili powder, pepper, curry and the like.
A lot of it, all right?

891
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:55,145
You'd better let me handle that, son.

892
01:30:28,095 --> 01:30:29,429
Here they are.

893
01:30:30,139 --> 01:30:31,223
Thank you, son.

894
01:30:31,348 --> 01:30:33,183
What's the matter with him?

895
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:34,852
He'll be all right.

896
01:30:39,523 --> 01:30:41,233
Hey, boy.

897
01:30:41,525 --> 01:30:44,319
Now listen. You're going to have
some fun. You hear that?

898
01:30:44,403 --> 01:30:47,156
Well, you remember how them dogs do
when they come through here...

899
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:49,908
so you can tell me
about it someday, okay?

900
01:32:04,441 --> 01:32:06,819
My wife hasn't written me for a month.

901
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:11,114
She's probably sick again.

902
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:17,162
Drag...

903
01:32:17,913 --> 01:32:19,706
magazine for you.

904
01:32:21,959 --> 01:32:23,919
- Carr, you got anything?
- Magazines.

905
01:32:24,002 --> 01:32:27,131
Hey, Koko, who's sending me magazines?

906
01:32:29,842 --> 01:32:31,552
Don't know. It's from Atlanta.

907
01:32:31,635 --> 01:32:32,970
My uncle!

908
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:37,474
Ain't heard from him in eight years
and now he's sending me magazines!

909
01:32:38,308 --> 01:32:39,977
He must have gone crazy!

910
01:32:44,815 --> 01:32:46,066
Look at that!

911
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:48,569
- That's Luke?
- Look at that, two of them.

912
01:32:51,321 --> 01:32:53,031
What's the writing say?

913
01:32:53,657 --> 01:32:55,576
What's that writing say?

914
01:32:55,659 --> 01:32:59,079
"Dear boys: Playing it cool. Luke."

915
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:01,373
Let me take a look. Come here.

916
01:33:01,456 --> 01:33:03,041
Hey, pass it around.

917
01:33:05,252 --> 01:33:07,254
They must be 6 feet tall.

918
01:33:11,258 --> 01:33:12,718
Give it back there.

919
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:15,512
Look at that!

920
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:17,848
My baby! We're in here
digging and dying...

921
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:20,392
he's out there living and flying.

922
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,422
Koko, will you stop that?

923
01:33:51,048 --> 01:33:52,966
Why don't you try making me?

924
01:34:04,269 --> 01:34:07,940
- Hey, Drag? Let me see the picture.
- What for?

925
01:34:08,065 --> 01:34:10,150
Come on, Drag, let us see the picture.

926
01:34:10,234 --> 01:34:12,319
No, you're just a kid.
What you know about it?

927
01:34:12,402 --> 01:34:14,780
You don't want to see that dirty picture.

928
01:34:14,905 --> 01:34:17,366
Luke and them broads and all that booze.

929
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:18,534
Come on, let me take a look.

930
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:21,203
It would go to your coconut head.
You're liable to get ideas...

931
01:34:21,328 --> 01:34:22,412
and pass right out.

932
01:34:22,496 --> 01:34:23,831
Come on, Drag, be a buddy.

933
01:34:23,914 --> 01:34:27,251
Now, what you figure it's worth?
A peek at that there picture?

934
01:34:27,334 --> 01:34:29,795
A quick look now.
I'm not talking about no memorizing job.

935
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,088
Cold drink.

936
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:33,674
A cold... One cold drink...

937
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:37,261
to feast your starving, fishy,
little eyes on the picture?

938
01:34:37,427 --> 01:34:39,638
A true vision of paradise itself...

939
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:43,475
with two of the angels right there
frisking around with my boy?

940
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:46,311
Okay, it's a deal.

941
01:34:46,395 --> 01:34:48,522
One cold drink, in advance.

942
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,038
One chilly bottle
right in my hot little hand.

943
01:35:05,122 --> 01:35:07,958
That goes for the rest
of you mullet-heads, too.

944
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:09,793
Let me see.

945
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:11,295
Did you pay?

946
01:35:15,299 --> 01:35:17,259
Coming in there, Wickerman.

947
01:35:45,829 --> 01:35:49,833
You run one time,
you get yourself a set of chains.

948
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:53,378
You run twice, you get yourself two sets.

949
01:35:54,004 --> 01:35:55,798
You ain't going to need no third set...

950
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:58,634
because you're going to get
your mind right.

951
01:35:59,218 --> 01:36:01,345
And I mean "right."

952
01:36:03,096 --> 01:36:05,098
Take a good look at Luke.

953
01:36:07,518 --> 01:36:08,769
Cool Hand Luke.

954
01:36:18,487 --> 01:36:20,405
- Easy, easy!
- Let him breathe!

955
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:25,202
Oh, my poor baby.
They done you real good.

956
01:36:25,285 --> 01:36:27,663
I don't know if you're going
to have them girls chasing you.

957
01:36:27,788 --> 01:36:28,956
I'll get some aspirin.

958
01:36:29,081 --> 01:36:31,208
- He should have a doctor.
- Ain't you ever gonna learn?

959
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:33,377
They ain't gonna let no doctor see
what they've done.

960
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:34,837
Some ice should take that swelling down.

961
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:38,132
Get your razor. We'll clean up
some of these cuts on his head.

962
01:36:38,215 --> 01:36:40,467
How you feeling, buddy? How you feeling?

963
01:36:40,551 --> 01:36:42,052
Maybe he can't hear you.

964
01:36:42,136 --> 01:36:44,888
Somebody ought to give him
something cold to drink.

965
01:36:44,972 --> 01:36:47,850
- That's my baby.
- Now he's going to be all right.

966
01:36:49,226 --> 01:36:52,604
Hey, Luke, look, we got the picture
you sent us. Look there.

967
01:36:57,192 --> 01:36:59,403
You really can pick them, Luke.

968
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:02,156
Come on, tell us. What were they like?

969
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:04,116
Can't you wait until he stops bleeding?

970
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:06,994
- Why don't you go back to your knitting?
- Knock it off, you guys.

971
01:37:07,077 --> 01:37:09,329
Picture's a phony. Cost me a week's pay.

972
01:37:09,413 --> 01:37:10,998
What do you mean, a phony?

973
01:37:11,081 --> 01:37:12,166
What you talking about, man?

974
01:37:12,249 --> 01:37:14,710
We see them two women
right here in the picture.

975
01:37:14,793 --> 01:37:17,004
Did you have them both at once?
I mean, together?

976
01:37:17,087 --> 01:37:20,424
Picture's a phony.
I had it made up for you guys.

977
01:37:20,549 --> 01:37:22,843
What do you mean? We saw it all!

978
01:37:22,926 --> 01:37:24,094
You was having a big time, man.

979
01:37:24,178 --> 01:37:25,345
You had it made!

980
01:37:25,429 --> 01:37:27,890
Nothing. Made nothing, had nothing.

981
01:37:28,474 --> 01:37:30,601
Couple of towns, couple of bosses.

982
01:37:31,101 --> 01:37:33,479
I laughed out loud once, he turned me in.

983
01:37:33,604 --> 01:37:34,605
But I got it here!

984
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:38,650
Oh, come on! Stop beating it!

985
01:37:39,610 --> 01:37:41,320
Get out there yourselves!

986
01:37:42,613 --> 01:37:46,283
Stop feeding off me! Get out of here!

987
01:37:46,617 --> 01:37:48,785
Can't breathe. Give me some air!

988
01:37:55,459 --> 01:37:57,419
Well, he ain't himself, can't you see that?

989
01:37:57,503 --> 01:38:00,422
He's all beat up.
He don't know what he's saying.

990
01:38:01,632 --> 01:38:03,884
All right, come on, break it up.

991
01:38:04,009 --> 01:38:05,427
Now, straighten out that bench.

992
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:29,451
You was eyeballing.

993
01:38:29,535 --> 01:38:32,663
Can't get your mind on them weeds
if you're eyeballing.

994
01:38:32,746 --> 01:38:35,415
You don't need reasons to kick me, Boss.

995
01:38:40,504 --> 01:38:43,632
First bell. Move it.

996
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:49,888
He'll never make it.

997
01:38:50,013 --> 01:38:51,849
What are you talking about?

998
01:39:02,943 --> 01:39:06,780
That old box will collapse and fall apart
before Luke calls it quits.

999
01:39:06,905 --> 01:39:09,116
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.

1000
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:11,368
Well, I don't see no sign of guts in you.

1001
01:39:11,451 --> 01:39:14,288
No. No chains, either.

1002
01:39:14,371 --> 01:39:16,665
Big deal paperhanger,
passing two-bit checks.

1003
01:39:16,748 --> 01:39:20,294
You haven't had much luck playing
follow-the-leader, have you?

1004
01:39:22,004 --> 01:39:25,632
All right! Last bell!

1005
01:39:26,049 --> 01:39:28,677
You want to spend the night
in the box, too?

1006
01:39:33,015 --> 01:39:37,311
Well, here's our champion hog-gut.
Ain't ate for four days.

1007
01:39:37,394 --> 01:39:40,522
You're going to need a little extra.
Got plenty for you.

1008
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:41,857
Now you know the rules.

1009
01:39:41,982 --> 01:39:44,443
Got to clean your plate
or go back in the box. Right, Boss?

1010
01:39:44,568 --> 01:39:45,819
That's enough, Dog Boy.

1011
01:39:45,903 --> 01:39:48,071
Oh, man used to free-world food
has got a big appetite.

1012
01:39:48,155 --> 01:39:51,116
We're going to stretch that
hog-belly right out, huh?

1013
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:09,611
One.

1014
01:41:10,946 --> 01:41:12,614
- Two.
- Three.

1015
01:41:12,698 --> 01:41:14,783
- Four.
- Five.

1016
01:41:14,867 --> 01:41:16,410
- Six.
- Seven.

1017
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:18,620
Well, you made the week, boy.

1018
01:41:19,329 --> 01:41:22,749
Now you got a day-and-a-half
to rest up for old Monday.

1019
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:24,418
Luke!

1020
01:41:52,362 --> 01:41:54,823
That ditch is Boss Keen's ditch.

1021
01:41:55,532 --> 01:41:57,993
I told him that dirt in it is your dirt.

1022
01:41:58,702 --> 01:42:00,954
What's your dirt doing in his ditch?

1023
01:42:02,206 --> 01:42:03,707
I don't know, Boss.

1024
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:07,211
You better get in there and get it out, boy.

1025
01:42:22,559 --> 01:42:24,478
<i>Well, you wake up in the morning</i>

1026
01:42:24,561 --> 01:42:26,814
<i>Hear the ding dong ring</i>

1027
01:42:26,897 --> 01:42:28,607
<i>You go a-marching to the table</i>

1028
01:42:28,899 --> 01:42:30,984
<i>See the same damn thing</i>

1029
01:42:31,068 --> 01:42:32,861
<i>Well, it's on the table</i>

1030
01:42:33,111 --> 01:42:35,322
<i>A knife, a fork and a pan</i>

1031
01:42:35,405 --> 01:42:37,032
<i>Say anything about it</i>

1032
01:42:37,282 --> 01:42:39,368
<i>You get in trouble with the man</i>

1033
01:42:39,451 --> 01:42:41,328
<i>You get in trouble with the man</i>

1034
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:43,205
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

1035
01:42:43,705 --> 01:42:45,499
<i>Shine a light on me</i>

1036
01:42:45,749 --> 01:42:47,626
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

1037
01:42:47,793 --> 01:42:50,462
<i>Shine her ever-loving light on me</i>

1038
01:42:51,755 --> 01:42:53,549
<i>If you ever go to Houston</i>

1039
01:42:53,924 --> 01:42:55,342
<i>Boy, you better walk right</i>

1040
01:42:55,425 --> 01:42:57,970
<i>And you better not stagger</i>

1041
01:42:58,053 --> 01:43:00,097
<i>And you better not fight</i>

1042
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:02,516
<i>'Cause the sheriff's gonna arrest you</i>

1043
01:43:02,599 --> 01:43:04,935
Luke, what do you think you're doing?

1044
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:10,315
Just getting my dirt
out of Boss Keen's ditch, Boss.

1045
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:13,527
I'll be damned if you're going
to put your dirt in my yard.

1046
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:15,445
You hear me?

1047
01:43:15,529 --> 01:43:17,489
Now let's get it out of there.

1048
01:43:19,032 --> 01:43:21,118
<i>If you ever go to Houston</i>

1049
01:43:21,201 --> 01:43:23,245
<i>Boy, you better walk right</i>

1050
01:43:23,328 --> 01:43:25,205
<i>And you better not stagger</i>

1051
01:43:25,289 --> 01:43:27,499
<i>And you better not fight</i>

1052
01:43:27,583 --> 01:43:29,251
<i>'Cause the sheriff's gonna arrest you</i>

1053
01:43:29,334 --> 01:43:31,336
<i>They're gonna take you down</i>

1054
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:33,547
<i>Say anything about it</i>

1055
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:35,883
<i>You're penitentiary-bound</i>

1056
01:43:35,966 --> 01:43:37,718
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

1057
01:43:37,801 --> 01:43:39,803
<i>Shine a light on me</i>

1058
01:44:00,491 --> 01:44:04,077
I told you to get your dirt out
of Boss Keen's ditch, didn't I?

1059
01:44:07,581 --> 01:44:08,749
Yeah, Boss.

1060
01:44:09,041 --> 01:44:10,959
Then how come it ain't out?

1061
01:44:17,508 --> 01:44:19,343
I don't know, Boss.

1062
01:44:19,676 --> 01:44:21,345
You don't know.

1063
01:44:44,868 --> 01:44:46,703
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1064
01:44:46,787 --> 01:44:50,124
<i>Gonna keep my body down</i>

1065
01:44:50,874 --> 01:44:53,210
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1066
01:44:53,544 --> 01:44:56,547
<i>Gonna hold my body down</i>

1067
01:44:58,882 --> 01:45:02,970
<i>Keep your mind on me above</i>

1068
01:45:03,053 --> 01:45:06,390
<i>Keep your heart full of love</i>

1069
01:45:07,015 --> 01:45:09,560
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1070
01:45:09,643 --> 01:45:13,147
<i>Gonna hold my body down</i>

1071
01:45:14,022 --> 01:45:16,400
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1072
01:45:16,483 --> 01:45:19,653
<i>Gonna hold my body down</i>

1073
01:45:51,935 --> 01:45:54,146
What's all this dirt doing in here?

1074
01:46:01,153 --> 01:46:03,155
I don't know.

1075
01:46:14,124 --> 01:46:16,335
<i>When I was a little bitty baby</i>

1076
01:46:16,418 --> 01:46:19,046
<i>My mamma used to rock me in my cradle</i>

1077
01:46:19,129 --> 01:46:22,633
<i>In them old cotton fields back home</i>

1078
01:46:23,467 --> 01:46:25,719
<i>It was down in Louisiana</i>

1079
01:46:25,803 --> 01:46:27,262
Don't, Boss.

1080
01:46:27,346 --> 01:46:28,722
Get to work.

1081
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:31,892
Don't, Boss. Don't hit me anymore.

1082
01:46:34,812 --> 01:46:37,189
For God's sake, don't hit me anymore.

1083
01:46:37,481 --> 01:46:41,777
What was that you said?
What was that name you used, Luke?

1084
01:46:43,278 --> 01:46:44,530
Oh, God!

1085
01:46:46,657 --> 01:46:47,908
Oh, God!

1086
01:46:53,163 --> 01:46:56,041
Oh, God, I pray to God
you don't hit me anymore.

1087
01:46:59,002 --> 01:47:02,339
I'll do anything you say,
but I can't take anymore.

1088
01:47:03,132 --> 01:47:06,093
- You got your mind right, Luke?
- Yeah...

1089
01:47:08,387 --> 01:47:09,847
I got it right.

1090
01:47:13,058 --> 01:47:15,269
Oh, I got it right, Boss.

1091
01:47:23,026 --> 01:47:25,028
Suppose you was to backslide on us?

1092
01:47:25,112 --> 01:47:27,114
Oh, no, I won't, Boss.

1093
01:47:27,865 --> 01:47:30,033
Suppose you was to back-sass?

1094
01:47:30,367 --> 01:47:33,120
Oh, no, I won't. I won't.
I got my mind right.

1095
01:47:41,378 --> 01:47:43,755
You try to run again,
we're going to kill you.

1096
01:47:43,881 --> 01:47:45,591
I won't, I won't, Boss.

1097
01:47:52,055 --> 01:47:56,393
Go get cleaned up and get yourself
some sleep. Suspect you need it.

1098
01:47:58,896 --> 01:48:00,230
Come on, son.

1099
01:48:02,065 --> 01:48:03,775
Come on up out of there.

1100
01:48:38,268 --> 01:48:40,354
Coming in, Boss.

1101
01:49:07,131 --> 01:49:08,674
I got my mind right.

1102
01:49:44,835 --> 01:49:46,086
Where are you?

1103
01:49:47,838 --> 01:49:49,548
Where are you now?

1104
01:50:36,553 --> 01:50:40,474
- All right. Smoke it up.
- Yes, sir.

1105
01:50:42,017 --> 01:50:44,561
Luke, water them down.

1106
01:50:45,687 --> 01:50:46,939
Yes, Boss.

1107
01:51:09,086 --> 01:51:11,088
Luke! Fetch the rifle.

1108
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:03,515
You got him, Boss. You got him.

1109
01:52:03,974 --> 01:52:05,434
Go fetch it, Luke.

1110
01:52:25,996 --> 01:52:29,124
There he is, Boss.
Deader than hell, but won't let go.

1111
01:52:39,343 --> 01:52:41,970
You cut that up for our lunch, Luke.

1112
01:52:42,930 --> 01:52:44,765
Yes, sir, Boss Paul.

1113
01:53:31,228 --> 01:53:33,689
He took the keys off of Dog Boy's truck.

1114
01:53:34,857 --> 01:53:36,692
He got the keys here, too.

1115
01:53:52,916 --> 01:53:56,086
"I'm shaking it here, Boss. I'm shaking it."

1116
01:54:02,259 --> 01:54:03,927
That's my baby, Luke.

1117
01:54:07,431 --> 01:54:10,601
"Don't hit me, Boss. Don't hit me.

1118
01:54:11,602 --> 01:54:15,439
"I'll do whatever you say.
Only don't hit me."

1119
01:54:15,522 --> 01:54:18,150
You are an original, that's what you are.

1120
01:54:18,233 --> 01:54:20,903
Those mullet-heads didn't even know
you were fooling them.

1121
01:54:22,696 --> 01:54:26,200
Fooling them? You can't fool them
about something like that.

1122
01:54:26,283 --> 01:54:27,534
They broke me.

1123
01:54:28,952 --> 01:54:32,289
But they didn't get my mind right.
Not with no stick. No, sir.

1124
01:54:33,165 --> 01:54:36,251
All that time you were planning
on running again.

1125
01:54:36,543 --> 01:54:39,171
I've never planned anything in my life.

1126
01:55:05,322 --> 01:55:08,408
That's just a little old farm road.
Clean as a whistle.

1127
01:55:08,492 --> 01:55:12,162
I worked it a couple times.
We're home free. Come on.

1128
01:55:12,287 --> 01:55:13,539
We ain't going nowhere.

1129
01:55:13,664 --> 01:55:15,666
Now, what are you talking about, Luke?

1130
01:55:15,749 --> 01:55:18,585
We're going by my house
and we're going to have a big meal.

1131
01:55:18,669 --> 01:55:23,215
Then, I'm going to show you a couple of
farm girls that really knows what fun...

1132
01:55:24,341 --> 01:55:26,260
And then we're going to get Koko
out of there.

1133
01:55:26,343 --> 01:55:29,012
And then the terrible trio
going to be complete again.

1134
01:55:29,096 --> 01:55:32,850
Man, this old free world
ain't going to know which ear to stand on.

1135
01:55:33,433 --> 01:55:36,728
Yeah, well, you and Koko
can handle it without me.

1136
01:55:37,729 --> 01:55:39,731
What you mean, Luke?

1137
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:42,276
I've done enough world-shaking
for a while.

1138
01:55:42,359 --> 01:55:45,529
You do the rest of it for me.
Send me a postcard about it.

1139
01:55:45,612 --> 01:55:47,614
- But, Luke...
- Take it easy, Drag.

1140
01:55:47,698 --> 01:55:49,616
Where are you going?

1141
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:50,951
Just on my own.

1142
01:55:52,369 --> 01:55:55,289
But what am I going to do, all by myself?

1143
01:55:57,541 --> 01:56:01,295
Man, if I hadn't lost my head.
I only had a couple of years to do.

1144
01:56:02,212 --> 01:56:05,549
But when I saw you tearing down the road
in that truck...

1145
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:10,471
Well, you're right, Luke.

1146
01:56:11,722 --> 01:56:13,390
We ought to split up.

1147
01:56:14,057 --> 01:56:18,562
And then, and then it will be safer
for the both of us.

1148
01:56:23,066 --> 01:56:26,487
Just the same,
you're a good old boy, Luke.

1149
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:30,824
You take care!

1150
01:56:33,911 --> 01:56:35,579
You hear?

1151
01:57:28,006 --> 01:57:29,341
Anybody here?

1152
01:57:44,857 --> 01:57:46,942
Hey, old man. You home tonight?

1153
01:57:52,114 --> 01:57:55,617
Can you spare a minute?
It's about time we had a little talk.

1154
01:57:59,705 --> 01:58:01,832
I know I'm a pretty evil fellow...

1155
01:58:02,249 --> 01:58:06,086
killed people in the war and got drunk...

1156
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:08,881
and chewed up municipal property
and the like.

1157
01:58:08,964 --> 01:58:10,966
I know I got no call to ask for much...

1158
01:58:11,049 --> 01:58:15,554
but even so, you've got to admit,
you ain't dealt me no cards in a long time.

1159
01:58:16,805 --> 01:58:20,976
It's beginning to look like you got
things fixed so I can't never win out.

1160
01:58:21,977 --> 01:58:24,021
Inside, outside, all of them...

1161
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:28,275
rules and regulations and bosses.

1162
01:58:28,358 --> 01:58:30,194
You made me like I am.

1163
01:58:30,694 --> 01:58:33,071
Now just where am I supposed to fit in?

1164
01:58:35,908 --> 01:58:38,744
Old man, I gotta tell you.

1165
01:58:40,454 --> 01:58:42,831
I started out pretty strong and fast...

1166
01:58:47,586 --> 01:58:49,797
but it's beginning to get to me.

1167
01:58:52,049 --> 01:58:53,467
When does it end?

1168
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:57,304
What do you got in mind for me?

1169
01:58:57,971 --> 01:58:59,473
What do I do now?

1170
01:59:04,102 --> 01:59:05,479
All right.

1171
01:59:14,613 --> 01:59:16,114
On my knees, asking.

1172
01:59:28,794 --> 01:59:30,712
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1173
01:59:32,923 --> 01:59:35,300
I guess I'm pretty tough to deal with, huh?

1174
01:59:36,426 --> 01:59:37,928
A hard case.

1175
01:59:41,473 --> 01:59:43,183
I guess I gotta find my own way.

1176
01:59:56,530 --> 01:59:57,531
Luke!

1177
02:00:08,292 --> 02:00:10,252
Is that your answer, old man?

1178
02:00:12,504 --> 02:00:14,590
I guess you're a hard case, too.

1179
02:00:19,845 --> 02:00:21,847
Luke, you all right?

1180
02:00:23,974 --> 02:00:27,978
They got us, boy. They're out there,
thicker than flies.

1181
02:00:28,353 --> 02:00:30,647
Bosses, dogs, sheriffs...

1182
02:00:30,772 --> 02:00:33,942
more guns than I've ever seen in my life.
You ain't got a chance.

1183
02:00:34,026 --> 02:00:36,778
They caught up with me
right after we split up.

1184
02:00:37,446 --> 02:00:40,949
And they was aiming to kill you.
But I fixed that.

1185
02:00:41,533 --> 02:00:44,703
I got them to promise
if you give up peaceful...

1186
02:00:45,454 --> 02:00:48,207
they ain't even going
to whip you this time.

1187
02:00:49,458 --> 02:00:51,835
They're even going to give us
our same bunks back?

1188
02:00:52,669 --> 02:00:54,505
Sure, why not?

1189
02:00:54,588 --> 02:00:58,759
We've only been gone a couple of hours.
They're reasonable men.

1190
02:01:03,347 --> 02:01:04,723
Yeah, well.

1191
02:01:07,893 --> 02:01:09,728
You've got to listen to me.

1192
02:01:11,063 --> 02:01:14,399
All you've got to do is give up...

1193
02:01:14,817 --> 02:01:16,276
nice and quiet.

1194
02:01:17,736 --> 02:01:19,571
Just play it cool.

1195
02:01:22,366 --> 02:01:24,076
Yeah, like I always do?

1196
02:01:24,701 --> 02:01:26,912
Yeah, just play it...

1197
02:01:33,043 --> 02:01:34,711
What're you doing?

1198
02:01:54,857 --> 02:01:58,610
"What we got here
is a failure to communicate."

1199
02:02:42,362 --> 02:02:43,530
Go get him.

1200
02:03:20,484 --> 02:03:23,987
You hang on in there, Luke. You hang on.

1201
02:03:25,906 --> 02:03:28,742
There's going to be
some world-shaking, Luke.

1202
02:03:29,993 --> 02:03:32,204
We're going to send you a postcard.

1203
02:03:33,539 --> 02:03:36,291
You follow me and I'll radio
the emergency clinic to open up.

1204
02:03:36,375 --> 02:03:38,585
I'm taking him to the prison hospital.

1205
02:03:38,710 --> 02:03:40,462
But that's an hour away. He won't make it.

1206
02:03:40,546 --> 02:03:43,090
Get out of the way. He's ours.

1207
02:04:28,218 --> 02:04:30,429
They took him right down that road.

1208
02:04:30,554 --> 02:04:33,265
- What'd he look like, Drag?
- Yeah, Drag, what did he look like?

1209
02:04:33,348 --> 02:04:35,476
Did he have his eyes open or closed?

1210
02:04:35,601 --> 02:04:38,145
- He was smiling.
- Smiling?

1211
02:04:39,771 --> 02:04:44,902
<i>That's right. You know,
that Luke smile of his?</i>

1212
02:04:45,152 --> 02:04:47,696
<i>He had it on his face right to the very end.</i>

1213
02:04:47,946 --> 02:04:49,198
<i>Hell, if they didn't know it before...</i>

1214
02:04:49,323 --> 02:04:53,327
<i>they could tell right then
that they weren't ever going to beat him.</i>

1215
02:04:53,786 --> 02:04:55,704
<i>That old Luke smile.</i>

1216
02:04:57,831 --> 02:05:02,878
<i>Oh, Luke. He was some boy.
Cool Hand Luke, hell!</i>

1217
02:05:03,921 --> 02:05:06,256
<i>He's a natural born world-shaker!</i>

1218
