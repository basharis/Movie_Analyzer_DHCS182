1
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,514
Thought I told you not to run
them sheep on my land!

2
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,260
It's my land, Garrett.

3
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:32,223
It became mine when
we signed that lease.

4
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:34,729
He's right, Mr. Garrett.

5
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:39,683
I'm paying you off when we get back,
and I'm breaking that damn lease.

6
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:43,689
- I don't allow the law'd agree to that.
- What law is that?

7
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:46,698
Santa Fe Ring law?

8
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,870
Shit.

9
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:52,909
- Goddamn law is ruining the country.
- Ain't you still a part of that law?

10
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:56,495
Something wrong with that harness.

11
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:03,876
I believe they elected you and paid you
good wages for killing the Kid, huh?

12
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:09,099
You rotten son of a bitch.

13
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:29,949
- You try your luck, Eno.
- You miss more than anybody else does.

14
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:32,746
I'll bet on it.

15
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:07,525
Want the breast or the thigh?

16
00:02:08,117 --> 00:02:09,660
What he always gets.

17
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:13,826
I want a breast and a thigh.

18
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:19,706
Jesus Christ!

19
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,541
- Who is it?
- Get down!

20
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:25,543
Goddamn, that's Garrett.

21
00:02:35,728 --> 00:02:37,353
Hello, Bill.

22
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:42,227
- It's fair shooting for an old married man.
- Lucky, I guess. How are you, Kid?

23
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:44,229
- Good to see you.
- Good seeing you.

24
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:47,155
- Hey, Billy!
- Who's this you got with you?

25
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:50,775
- Looking good.
- Having some kind of fiesta? Hello, Black.

26
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,269
We always live like this.
You ought to visit us more often.

27
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:59,443
I reckon the whole damn territory's
gonna be one big open jug for us now.

28
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:02,285
- Is that right, Pat?
- Ain't that right, Pat?

29
00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:07,447
Take a two-day ride from Lincoln just
to pay me back the $2 you owe me, Pat?

30
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,248
You'd better collect it now, Black.

31
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:13,701
We ain't gonna be seeing much
of Pat these days.

32
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:18,961
Say, I understand those Mexican <i>señoritas</i>
are still pretty as ever down there.

33
00:03:19,594 --> 00:03:20,594
Yeah?

34
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:24,423
I know one's waiting on you, hoss,
with a knife.

35
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:28,225
- Remember them sisters?
- No. Which ones were they?

36
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:30,968
That one you got up and asked
how much you owed.

37
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:34,682
And she said,
"Whatever you think it's worth."

38
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:37,647
You threw a dime on her pillow.

39
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:42,233
Girl said, "If that's all it's worth,
I might as well sew it up."

40
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:45,745
Son of a bitch.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

41
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:52,494
You don't figure he's too good
to drink with us, do you?

42
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,377
Maybe it's the other way around.

43
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:03,839
Jesus, don't you get stale
around here, Bill?

44
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:08,510
Maybe a year or so down in Mexico
will do you some good.

45
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:12,311
I didn't figure you'd bother
to make a ride out here.

46
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:15,139
Shit, you know me better than that.

47
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:16,597
You heard about Eben?

48
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:19,612
He drowned in the Rio Grande.

49
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,187
Trying to get to that old Mex
you're talking about.

50
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:24,988
He took two of the posse with him.

51
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,033
I'm sorry to hear that.

52
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:31,703
I always liked old Eben.

53
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:38,297
At least he knew when it was
the right time to leave.

54
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:42,046
We did have some times, didn't we?

55
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:49,300
It's gotta be pretty hard
to turn your back on all that.

56
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:55,646
You want it straight?

57
00:04:55,815 --> 00:04:58,141
If that's what you're here for.

58
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:03,603
The electorate...

59
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:06,404
...wants you gone.

60
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,403
Out of the country.

61
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:17,836
But are they telling me,
or are they asking me?

62
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:24,249
I'm asking you.

63
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:30,718
But in five days, I'm making you.

64
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,686
Because I might take over sheriff
of Lincoln County.

65
00:05:35,855 --> 00:05:37,433
Old Pat.

66
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:41,314
Sheriff Pat Garrett.

67
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:44,613
Sold out to the Santa Fe Ring.

68
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,076
How does it feel?

69
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:52,454
It...

70
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:59,742
...feels like times have changed.

71
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,665
Times maybe.

72
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,241
Not me.

73
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:16,969
Hey, why don't you stick around.

74
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:19,056
We got a few days left, ain't we?

75
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:22,897
No, I gotta get back.

76
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:28,151
<i>Adiós,</i> Pat.

77
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:30,319
<i>Adiós,</i> Bill.

78
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:32,653
Don't press your luck.

79
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:38,533
I ain't worried about my luck.

80
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,716
Why don't you kill him.

81
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:55,893
Why?

82
00:06:57,312 --> 00:06:58,889
He's my friend.

83
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,963
Get on up, Billy.
You hear what I'm saying?

84
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:55,838
I ain't making no money
watching you boys sleep.

85
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:59,679
You like to waste the best part
of the damn day.

86
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:02,812
Let that squirrel loose!
You'll shake it to death.

87
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:05,850
- I'm just scratching.
- Chisum's cattle is waiting.

88
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:08,266
Oh, let them wait.

89
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:18,494
I hate a son of a bitch that gets up
noisy and full of himself.

90
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:21,865
I ain't in this for my health, hateful.

91
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:28,129
That's awful.

92
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:38,383
- Pat ain't gonna like this.
- What?

93
00:09:38,848 --> 00:09:43,344
Coming down hard on him
the day after he got his new badge.

94
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,678
Hell, there ain't no way
he's gonna know.

95
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:48,314
I ain't afraid of Pat Garrett.

96
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:52,812
Well, all right, a little bit.

97
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,782
Bastards.

98
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:02,193
I'd best go get them horses watered.

99
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:34,560
Goddamn Chisum.

100
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:37,064
How'd he know we was here?

101
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:40,616
- Hell, that's Garrett.
- Goddamn him too.

102
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:44,617
Now he's got Bell and half the town
of Lincoln out there with him.

103
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:54,500
Help me up.

104
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:57,549
Sweet Mary's ass!

105
00:10:57,802 --> 00:10:59,594
Don't let me go down.

106
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:07,425
They killed me. I'm gut-shot for sure.

107
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:12,935
Hold your fire!

108
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:14,603
Hold your fire!

109
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:16,225
Hold it!

110
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:18,447
Bill!

111
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:21,323
Come out!
You don't have a chance!

112
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:24,786
What are you taking me in for?

113
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:28,075
Which one was that?

114
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,989
Buckshot Roberts.

115
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:33,120
For the killing of Buckshot Roberts!

116
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:36,669
Hell, that was a year ago.

117
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,460
I shot him straight up.

118
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:43,806
Come on in, Pat!

119
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,933
I'll warm your breakfast!

120
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:55,985
Guess he ate.

121
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:01,781
They're closing down
the store on us for sure.

122
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:14,870
Maybe it's time you took a walk.

123
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:21,175
Hell, yes.

124
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:23,111
Why not?

125
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:25,633
I can still hold a gun.

126
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:33,397
We gotta move. I'm going fast.

127
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:35,983
Kid.

128
00:12:38,153 --> 00:12:40,394
Sweet Mary's ass!

129
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,148
I'm going now, so, by God,
let's get on with it.

130
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:48,662
Hey.

131
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,113
I ain't afraid of him now.

132
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:57,497
Hold your fire! We're coming out!

133
00:12:58,465 --> 00:12:59,875
Hold it!

134
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,554
- You go left. I'll go right.
- Might be they ain't circled us.

135
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:10,183
Might be the dog would've caught
the rabbit if he hadn't thought to shit.

136
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,052
Where are the goddamn horses?

137
00:13:38,922 --> 00:13:41,377
- That's enough!
- Hold it! Hold it!

138
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,382
All right, Kid!

139
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,594
Come on out if you're still alive!

140
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,716
Game's over!

141
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:56,766
Coming out, Pat!

142
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:43,317
You're in poor company, Pat.

143
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:49,366
Yeah, I'm alive, though.

144
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:53,595
So am I.

145
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:27,027
I never figured to hear you brag
on being a working man.

146
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:31,902
Well, I never figured you
for the law either.

147
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:37,611
It's just a way of staying alive.

148
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,995
No matter what side you're on,
you're always right.

149
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,421
And I aim to live to be rich,
old and gray.

150
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:51,721
That's a fine ambition, Pat.

151
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:57,055
You keep thinking like that.
I'll think on how I'll spend your money.

152
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:59,303
Only thing you've got
to think about...

153
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:03,058
...is when you stand before
the highest court there is.

154
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,558
May it sit in judgment
on your rotten soul.

155
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:08,562
Now, you listen. Listen to me good.

156
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:12,403
Before that rope snaps,
it'll hit you like a bolt of lightning...

157
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:15,197
...that what I've been telling you
is the truth!

158
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:19,791
You'll learn to believe
before I'm finished.

159
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,458
That's 3 to you.

160
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:27,538
What do you believe in, Bell?

161
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,592
I do believe I'm gonna
have to see that bet...

162
00:16:35,098 --> 00:16:37,221
...and raise you 5.
- Billy...

163
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:41,224
...somewhere in the Good Book,
it says there's a time for everything.

164
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:44,101
A time to love, a time to hate...

165
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:46,476
...a time to kill.

166
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:52,231
But now it's time
you got close to God, boy.

167
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:55,025
I heard God's fast...

168
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:58,866
...but I have to go up in front of him
myself before I'd bet on it.

169
00:16:59,914 --> 00:17:01,658
You will.

170
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:06,872
Well, that puts me on my way.

171
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:11,507
I got to go collect a few more taxes.
He's all yours. Two days, boys.

172
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:14,132
I count eight days till dawn, Billy.

173
00:17:14,304 --> 00:17:18,717
You'd best be on your knees and making
the acquaintance of your Lord and master.

174
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:23,805
Pat, keep that mule's asshole away
from me before I have to break him.

175
00:17:24,314 --> 00:17:26,223
I surely wish you'd try, son.

176
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:29,400
I got my shotgun full of 16 thin dimes.

177
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:32,612
Enough to spread you out
like a crazy woman's quilt.

178
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:35,188
- Bob.
- Why don't you sing a song of Jesus...

179
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:38,782
...while there's still a way.
- Bob. Bob.

180
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:40,234
Damn it.

181
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:45,948
Mess around with him one more time,
I'll send your ass back to Texas.

182
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:47,325
Don't.

183
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:51,543
I think I'd like to keep him here a while.

184
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:25,322
I fold, Billy.

185
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:35,422
Folding three queens, now, are you?

186
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:39,718
You must be afraid
I'll go out a loser, Bell.

187
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:44,549
- I guess I just ain't seeing them.
- Well, I'll tell you what...

188
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:48,727
...as long as I'm breathing,
let's play it straight.

189
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:53,062
I ain't sold my saddle like you
and the rest of the town boys, Bell.

190
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:57,071
Or it's just Bob that smells
like street shit over there.

191
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,076
On your knees!

192
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:04,954
Kiss my ass.

193
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:08,709
Bob!

194
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:12,503
Repent, you son of a bitch!

195
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,917
Sweet Jesus, I repent.

196
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:18,417
Leave off, Bob! You've gone loco!

197
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:35,230
I'm going across the street
and have a drink.

198
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:37,277
I'm thirsty as hell.

199
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,404
I wanna tell you one last thing
personal, Kid.

200
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:49,534
It's gonna be a loose rope
and a long drop.

201
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:56,380
That last thump got my guts going.

202
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:59,459
I need to go to the outhouse.

203
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,644
My horse locoed on me once
coming back from Pacheco.

204
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:20,603
I had to cut the second bar in his mouth
and bleed him.

205
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:23,736
He died on me,
and I ended up walking 40 miles.

206
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:28,156
I never was much for walking.

207
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:30,656
Well, I ain't never walked a mile since.

208
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:37,211
Fell in with a bunch of Mescaleros.

209
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:44,506
They was just off the reservation,
and I was "suspicioned" of them.

210
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:48,762
But I had some biscuit on me.
I give it to them, and they just rode off.

211
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:57,519
That's a hell of a story, Bell.

212
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:07,320
You know, I believe old Pat's
lost his sand.

213
00:21:07,495 --> 00:21:09,618
He won't come on a man.

214
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:14,368
You ought not to talk about him that way.
You and him used to be pretty close.

215
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:18,252
He ain't the same man.

216
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:27,678
He signed himself over to Chisum
and every other landowner...

217
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:31,016
...that's trying to put a fence
around this country.

218
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:33,850
That's what you been doing, ain't it?

219
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:36,595
Selling us out and getting fat.

220
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:39,151
Ain't that easy, Billy.

221
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:57,908
You was a friend of Carlyle's,
wasn't you, Bell?

222
00:21:58,088 --> 00:22:00,246
You know I was.

223
00:22:02,258 --> 00:22:05,924
I don't mean to be contrary,
but did I ever tell you how he died?

224
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,763
I shot him three times in the back,
blew his goddamn head off.

225
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:14,684
I don't wanna kill you, Bell.

226
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:17,646
Well, I sure hope you don't, Billy.

227
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:20,519
Then just move toward me.

228
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:26,901
Don't. Don't do it, please.

229
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:32,199
You wouldn't shoot me in the back, Billy.

230
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:42,714
- What the hell was that?
- There's been a shooting.

231
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:47,589
Get in the house!

232
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:58,312
- He's got a shotgun.
- Somebody get the sheriff!

233
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:03,724
How does Jesus look to you now, Bob?

234
00:23:04,404 --> 00:23:05,732
Bonney's killed Bell!

235
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:08,987
Yeah, and he's killed me too.

236
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,494
Keep the change, Bob.

237
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:38,390
Bring me an ax.

238
00:24:10,387 --> 00:24:12,878
Get back, I don't wanna kill you.

239
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:24,854
Go over to that livery stable,
get me the best horse you've got.

240
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:03,884
Caught your horse, Billy.

241
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,602
Try him again.

242
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:13,770
By God, I think I'm just gonna trade you
that fine brown horse for your buckskin.

243
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:16,270
What the hell, Billy?

244
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:27,330
I'll thrown in $ 1.60 worth of change
if you can dig it out of old Bob there.

245
00:29:31,082 --> 00:29:35,246
Would some of you people
get him up off the ground and into it?

246
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:39,458
Anything you say, sheriff.

247
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:52,428
Hell of a mess, Pat.

248
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:55,555
Shot Bell and Ollinger and rode on out.

249
00:29:55,732 --> 00:29:58,982
Yeah. Do me up good this time, Zeppy.

250
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:02,981
And leave the mustache on it.

251
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:12,365
- Is the boy around?
- Boy.

252
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:19,665
Speak to Mr. Garrett.

253
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:22,673
Yes, sir?

254
00:30:23,176 --> 00:30:25,584
I want you to run down
to my house.

255
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:29,178
Tell Mrs. Garrett that I'm gonna
be home for dinner.

256
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:32,350
Then I want you to stampede
over to the courthouse...

257
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:35,804
...find John Neully and the others
standing around there...

258
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,646
...and tell them to come over here
and pay me a visit. Got that?

259
00:30:41,695 --> 00:30:44,980
John Neully, courthouse. Yes, sir.

260
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,539
Who are you?

261
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:05,965
That's a good question.

262
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,889
I believe you know of me.

263
00:31:15,437 --> 00:31:17,476
Bill Kermit.

264
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:23,350
Wanted for horse-thieving
down in Seven Rivers, ain't you?

265
00:31:23,528 --> 00:31:25,770
That'd be me, sheriff.

266
00:31:26,823 --> 00:31:29,990
Killed old C.B. Denning last year
at Silver City...

267
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,244
...for calling you at cheating at monte.

268
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:37,161
That'd be me. Alamosa Bill.

269
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,420
Well, Bill, I'm gonna make you
my deputy.

270
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:53,507
Listen, Bill, why don't you go out back...

271
00:31:54,517 --> 00:31:57,471
...find us a couple of steaks
and a mess of eggs.

272
00:31:57,896 --> 00:32:02,143
And get one of them good bottles
they got behind the bar there.

273
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:05,566
I wanna have me a bath.

274
00:32:17,624 --> 00:32:20,874
It should take you about two weeks
to make the circle.

275
00:32:21,628 --> 00:32:22,628
Yeah.

276
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:37,570
- They say William Bonney's escaped.
- He has.

277
00:33:40,123 --> 00:33:42,246
And he's in Mexico, I hope.

278
00:33:47,338 --> 00:33:50,043
Where we should be if I had any sense.

279
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:52,586
If not...

280
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:56,884
...I'll go after him.
Got too much riding on it not to.

281
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,137
I figure that's why they elected me.

282
00:34:01,478 --> 00:34:03,803
Anyways, I don't give a damn.

283
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:06,768
Brought him in once, I can do it again...

284
00:34:06,941 --> 00:34:08,768
...if I have to.

285
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:13,400
You might say that
you are glad to see me.

286
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:16,993
It's been over a week you've been gone.

287
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,660
I'm sorry.

288
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,254
I gotta go down to the saloon,
there's a...

289
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:35,719
...drunk there causing a lot of trouble.
Goes by the name of Alamosa Bill.

290
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:39,552
Said he rode with the Kid
down in west Texas.

291
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:45,145
Will you be blessing this house
with your presence for dinner?

292
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:49,352
Looks like it's gonna be a long night.

293
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:54,272
- It's been a long year.
- Not now.

294
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:56,819
My people don't talk to me.

295
00:34:57,701 --> 00:35:02,197
They say you are getting to be too much
of a gringo since you've been sheriff.

296
00:35:02,372 --> 00:35:04,199
That you make deals with Chisum.

297
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:07,500
You don't touch me.

298
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:10,584
You are dead inside.

299
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:13,621
- I wish you'd never put on that badge.
- Not now.

300
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:17,501
Or I won't be here when you get back!

301
00:35:26,563 --> 00:35:28,390
We'll deal with this...

302
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:31,773
...when it's over.

303
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:37,105
I hope he gets away.

304
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:39,275
Well, he won't.

305
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:42,618
There's too much play in him.

306
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:45,404
And not enough in you.

307
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:24,654
You're late, Pat.

308
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,998
More cognac, please.

309
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:51,729
- Good of you to come, sheriff.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

310
00:36:51,898 --> 00:36:54,471
- It's a pleasure to see you.
- Thank you, sir.

311
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:57,058
May I offer you some supper?

312
00:36:57,612 --> 00:37:02,191
Oh, no. No, I think I might have
a little of that brandy, though.

313
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:04,822
Of course. Some brandy.

314
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,697
I do hope you enjoy
these rainy New Mexican evenings.

315
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:12,709
They have a fabulous melancholy
to them.

316
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,418
They bring us closer
to some greater design.

317
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:20,715
At least I hope so.

318
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:31,349
Allow me to introduce
Mr. Lewellyn Howland.

319
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:35,435
And this man is Norris.

320
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:42,110
These gentlemen are very concerned
about the escape of William Bonney.

321
00:37:42,282 --> 00:37:46,362
- A concern I'm sure you also share.
- He escaped from my jail.

322
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,220
Exactly.

323
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:59,086
This territory is vast and primitive.

324
00:37:59,883 --> 00:38:05,553
There is money here, growing investments
and political interests.

325
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:07,714
We must protect these investments...

326
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:10,595
...so the area can continue
to prosper and grow.

327
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,935
- You rode with the Kid, didn't you?
- I did.

328
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:18,103
- Then you must be aware of his moves.
- Well, I know Billy.

329
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:22,226
- And he ain't exactly predictable.
- Oh, come now, sheriff.

330
00:38:22,405 --> 00:38:25,192
For a man who's half outlaw himself
and still smart enough...

331
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:29,744
...to be elected sheriff by Chisum and
the ranchers, I expect better than that.

332
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,487
Can you bring him in,
or should we look elsewhere?

333
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:34,742
Oh, I can bring him in.

334
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:39,414
If you and the big peckerheads don't mess
things up by starting another cattle war.

335
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:44,584
I assure you, Chisum and the others have
been advised to recognize their position.

336
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:50,258
And in this particular game,
there are only a few plays left.

337
00:38:50,558 --> 00:38:54,603
I'd advise you to grab on to a winning
hand while you have a chance.

338
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,812
We're offering a reward of $ 1000
for the Kid's capture.

339
00:39:05,615 --> 00:39:07,987
You can have 500 now.

340
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:11,615
Well, I aim to bring the Kid in.

341
00:39:12,122 --> 00:39:14,447
But until I do...

342
00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:19,037
...better take your $500
and shove it up your ass and set fire to it.

343
00:39:42,402 --> 00:39:45,071
Commendable notion, sheriff.

344
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:16,829
Eno.

345
00:41:18,873 --> 00:41:20,617
Well, now.

346
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:36,764
I'm gonna blow the top of your
cow-humping head off, son of a bitch.

347
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:39,258
How's it going, Luke?

348
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,438
You are a son of a bitch.

349
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:45,932
I thought they's getting ready
to trim you.

350
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:49,026
There's a whole bunch of us
just fixing to ride in.

351
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:51,861
Well, I saved you all a trip.

352
00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:54,401
Or somebody did.

353
00:41:57,037 --> 00:42:00,951
I figured I'd lay back a few days.
Maybe more.

354
00:42:09,716 --> 00:42:14,259
Well, it sure is pleasurable
seeing you back again, Kid.

355
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:24,936
- You glad I'm back?
- Welcome home, Billy.

356
00:42:25,648 --> 00:42:27,356
And did you miss me?

357
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:31,855
So much you had to take up
with that low-down piece, old Hyatt.

358
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:49,250
<i>Cómo estás,</i> Silva?

359
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,546
<i>Buenos dias,</i> Billy.

360
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:56,003
Now, you're uglier than me.
How's it going, Beaver?

361
00:42:58,515 --> 00:43:03,722
Eno, I thought you boys would be out
in the Nueces or Colorado by now.

362
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:09,186
Well, I figured to watch you get stretched
but might have knowed you'd show up.

363
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,684
Good thing somebody did.

364
00:43:18,034 --> 00:43:21,035
These four rode in here this morning.

365
00:43:37,053 --> 00:43:39,260
What's your name, boy?

366
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:45,266
- Alias.
- Alias what?

367
00:43:45,437 --> 00:43:47,643
Alias anything you please.

368
00:43:47,814 --> 00:43:50,103
What do we call you?

369
00:43:50,275 --> 00:43:51,475
Alias.

370
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,560
- Hell, let's call him Alias.
- That's what I'd do.

371
00:43:57,866 --> 00:44:00,191
Alias it is.

372
00:44:06,624 --> 00:44:08,498
Thank you.

373
00:44:21,389 --> 00:44:22,789
My, my.

374
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,768
You boys hungry?

375
00:44:36,738 --> 00:44:40,071
- I didn't catch your name.
- I didn't give it out.

376
00:44:40,784 --> 00:44:43,738
Well, I guess that's why I didn't catch it.

377
00:44:45,163 --> 00:44:46,622
But I know yours.

378
00:44:47,248 --> 00:44:48,873
And that's enough.

379
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,587
Hey, Silva. Do you remember
that meeting with John Jones...

380
00:44:55,757 --> 00:44:59,422
...and that old man they called
U.S. Christmas, down near El Rito?

381
00:44:59,594 --> 00:45:03,295
- That old man they called U.S. Christmas?
- Right. See?

382
00:45:06,518 --> 00:45:10,930
Seems John stepped on one of U.S.'s
boots one night they was both in town.

383
00:45:11,815 --> 00:45:15,978
Old U.S., he'd been out hunting buffalo
for six months.

384
00:45:16,152 --> 00:45:21,573
Now, he was mean and testy
and damn near blind drunk.

385
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:27,330
He had on a pair of these flat-heeled,
about half-length Wellington boots.

386
00:45:27,831 --> 00:45:31,200
Them boots was the only thing he owned
he put any store in.

387
00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:36,536
And John stepped on one of them.

388
00:45:39,884 --> 00:45:43,004
That old man just stepped back and said:

389
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:45,338
"Let's get to it."

390
00:45:50,979 --> 00:45:54,312
So John said to U. S:

391
00:45:54,482 --> 00:45:57,056
"If you're gonna get that riled...

392
00:45:57,235 --> 00:46:00,900
...over a pair of foreign,
lady-looking boots...

393
00:46:01,698 --> 00:46:04,271
...we just might as well
get the ball rolling."

394
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:09,287
So they went in the middle
of the street.

395
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:11,947
And they took the 10 steps.

396
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:16,873
And John put three holes
right through that old man's chest.

397
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:40,524
I must have known them
from somewhere.

398
00:46:43,698 --> 00:46:46,236
It's too soon for bounty hunters.

399
00:46:47,702 --> 00:46:48,902
Alias?

400
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:13,390
What the hell?

401
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,830
Garrett?

402
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:20,311
I thought you was in Lincoln.

403
00:47:20,985 --> 00:47:24,568
- What the hell you doing?
- You get your ass over there, Gate.

404
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,661
Howdy, Cullen.

405
00:47:38,795 --> 00:47:41,001
How do you do, yourself?

406
00:47:41,673 --> 00:47:44,294
What are you doing
with that piece of sheep dip?

407
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:50,426
I'd like to blow his thieving head off
just for riding through my town.

408
00:47:57,397 --> 00:48:01,975
I ain't paid nobody no never mind.
Been staying in my own good hole.

409
00:48:02,152 --> 00:48:05,318
Fact is, I'm thinking about
going to Texas.

410
00:48:05,488 --> 00:48:07,362
Kid broke out.

411
00:48:07,657 --> 00:48:10,029
Killed Ollinger and Bell.

412
00:48:10,618 --> 00:48:14,747
I thought maybe Gate and some
of the boys might have a sign on him.

413
00:48:15,874 --> 00:48:19,456
Well, I still want him for that train robbery
up at Springer.

414
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:26,297
Gate's been holed up outside of town here
with Black Harris and Sut Cole.

415
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:29,219
Been meaning to roust them
out of here...

416
00:48:29,387 --> 00:48:32,305
...but somehow or other
I just can't get around to it.

417
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:37,136
I don't know nothing about the boys,
I don't know nothing about the Kid.

418
00:48:37,854 --> 00:48:42,267
Understand you've been
riding for Chisum.

419
00:48:44,486 --> 00:48:47,190
I'd rather be on the outside of the law...

420
00:48:47,364 --> 00:48:52,606
...than packing a badge for that town of
Lincoln and them that's a-running it.

421
00:48:56,873 --> 00:48:58,201
It's a job.

422
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:02,920
Comes an age in a man's life when...

423
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:09,049
...he don't wanna spend time
figuring what comes next.

424
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:11,377
Well, it's gonna cost you some change.

425
00:49:12,097 --> 00:49:15,181
I got to the point where
I don't do nothing for nobody...

426
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:18,137
...unless there's a piece of gold
attached to it.

427
00:49:37,831 --> 00:49:40,322
One of these days,
when I get my boat built...

428
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,951
...I'm gonna drift out of
this damn territory.

429
00:49:47,257 --> 00:49:51,005
This town's got no hat size nohow.

430
00:49:55,807 --> 00:49:56,807
Mama?

431
00:49:57,434 --> 00:49:59,675
Where'd you put my badge?

432
00:50:23,084 --> 00:50:25,373
I don't like it, Cullen.

433
00:50:26,046 --> 00:50:28,168
This town is not worth it.

434
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:35,463
Tell you the truth, Mama,
I don't take a shine to it myself.

435
00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:49,601
Anytime you're ready.

436
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,969
Company's coming.

437
00:51:20,141 --> 00:51:21,635
Sheriff Baker.

438
00:51:28,274 --> 00:51:29,934
Hey, Black Harris!

439
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:31,936
I wanna talk to you!

440
00:51:32,112 --> 00:51:33,855
Whoa, boys.

441
00:52:02,017 --> 00:52:03,217
Black.

442
00:52:12,736 --> 00:52:16,899
I ain't seen the Kid,
if that's what you're sniffing after.

443
00:52:17,657 --> 00:52:23,078
But if it's straight-up one-to-one
you want, then I'm your man.

444
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:25,955
I'm looking for sign, Black.

445
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:32,082
Us old boys ought not to be doing this
to each other.

446
00:52:33,506 --> 00:52:36,377
Ain't that many of us left.

447
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:41,379
Remember? You and me
rode into this county together.

448
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:45,220
How long ago was that, Pat?

449
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:49,932
Oh, hell, about 15 years ago.

450
00:52:56,404 --> 00:53:00,734
Pat, I know where the Kid's at.

451
00:53:01,242 --> 00:53:03,200
I'll tell you...

452
00:53:04,287 --> 00:53:07,786
...when you're lying proper
on the ground.

453
00:53:19,552 --> 00:53:22,340
It'll be the last words you ever hear.

454
00:55:01,154 --> 00:55:04,855
Hey, look at that.
Look at them turkeys.

455
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,075
Hey, hold them critters, Silva.

456
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:15,080
Go on, kid, let's get them.

457
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,098
Watch this.

458
00:55:39,943 --> 00:55:42,612
Get in there. Watch this.

459
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:47,521
Come on, Billy.

460
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:50,452
- Get out of the way, you son of a bitch.
- Grab him!

461
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:53,949
Move, Billy.

462
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,625
That's the way. Do it!

463
00:55:56,793 --> 00:55:58,417
Got mine.

464
00:55:58,753 --> 00:56:01,125
Both hands, man.

465
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:11,717
- What you got there?
- I got me a turkey.

466
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,905
Let me see that bird.

467
00:56:32,078 --> 00:56:35,862
Oh, I could have roped four or five
of them in if it wasn't for you.

468
00:56:39,878 --> 00:56:42,285
Them is Mr. Chisum's cattle.

469
00:56:47,427 --> 00:56:49,005
And this is Chisum's land.

470
00:56:57,854 --> 00:57:00,523
- Where you going with it, Silva?
- Get your rifle.

471
00:57:00,857 --> 00:57:03,015
You'll make a good living cow-thieving.

472
00:57:04,152 --> 00:57:05,895
Give him a good laugh.

473
00:59:55,031 --> 00:59:56,360
You want some coffee?

474
00:59:57,158 --> 00:59:59,068
I could use some.

475
01:00:02,872 --> 01:00:04,616
Name is Poe.

476
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:08,292
John W. Poe out of Fort Griffin, Texas.

477
01:00:10,255 --> 01:00:14,039
Maybe you saw me last month
in Santa Fe at Governor Wallace's.

478
01:00:19,806 --> 01:00:23,139
The governor made me a deputy.
I figure he probably told you.

479
01:00:25,645 --> 01:00:28,053
Already got me a deputy.

480
01:00:29,983 --> 01:00:32,355
Two's better than one.

481
01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:39,233
I answer only to the governor,
Mr. Norris and Mr. Howland.

482
01:00:45,415 --> 01:00:48,582
I heard talk on the trail
the Kid's in Mexico.

483
01:00:48,752 --> 01:00:50,709
Don't figure to me.

484
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:55,581
Most likely, he's trying to get
his old bunch together again.

485
01:01:12,275 --> 01:01:16,487
- Which way we going?
- I'm going southwest.

486
01:01:17,614 --> 01:01:19,986
That would be the Chisum ranch.

487
01:01:20,492 --> 01:01:21,902
Chisum is a fine man.

488
01:01:23,036 --> 01:01:25,408
Country's gotta make a choice.

489
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:29,827
Time's over for drifters and outlaws
and those who got no backbone.

490
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:34,410
I'm gonna tell you this once.
I don't wanna have to say it again.

491
01:01:35,215 --> 01:01:38,132
This country's getting old,
I aim to get old with it.

492
01:01:39,094 --> 01:01:41,252
Now, the Kid don't want it that way.

493
01:01:41,429 --> 01:01:44,596
He might be a better man for it.
I ain't judging.

494
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:47,257
But I don't want you explaining
nothing to me.

495
01:01:47,435 --> 01:01:51,813
I don't want you saying nothing about the
Kid and nobody else in my damn county.

496
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,036
Garrett to see you, Mr. Chisum.

497
01:02:14,212 --> 01:02:17,663
- All right. Somebody else try him.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Chisum.

498
01:02:23,847 --> 01:02:27,132
Mescaleros stole 40 head of horses
last week.

499
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,644
Yeah, I heard they was
off the reservation.

500
01:02:33,565 --> 01:02:36,649
Bonney tried to steal a few head
a couple of weeks ago.

501
01:02:36,818 --> 01:02:40,269
Well, he says you owe him
$500 back salary.

502
01:02:40,447 --> 01:02:44,029
He rode for me.
I treated him just like any other man.

503
01:02:48,538 --> 01:02:52,370
Sheriff, tell me something.
Why did you ride all the way out here?

504
01:02:52,709 --> 01:02:56,374
- Thought maybe you'd heard something.
- I'll tell you what I heard.

505
01:02:57,047 --> 01:03:00,914
Billy the Kid is in Tascosa.
Billy the Kid is in Tombstone.

506
01:03:01,092 --> 01:03:05,256
Billy the Kid is in Mexico, Tularosa,
Socorro, White Oaks.

507
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:10,139
And Billy the Kid is at my table
right at this moment...

508
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:14,557
...eating tacos and green chili peppers
with my niece, just like old times.

509
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:18,100
- You staying for supper?
- No, thanks.

510
01:03:20,236 --> 01:03:21,836
Mr. Poe?

511
01:03:24,157 --> 01:03:27,241
I... Yeah, yes, I could eat.

512
01:03:27,827 --> 01:03:30,401
Fine. Bunkhouse is right behind
the large barn.

513
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,905
Men usually eat
when the cook lets them.

514
01:03:36,503 --> 01:03:40,370
Interesting meeting you, Mr. Poe.
Perhaps I'll see you again some time.

515
01:03:41,174 --> 01:03:43,048
Glad to be of service, Garrett.

516
01:03:43,426 --> 01:03:45,253
But don't overuse it.

517
01:03:49,474 --> 01:03:51,099
I appreciate the loan.

518
01:03:55,939 --> 01:03:57,931
You gonna get him?

519
01:04:39,607 --> 01:04:40,852
My friend.

520
01:04:41,568 --> 01:04:44,604
<i>Buena suerte</i> until I see you.

521
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,403
Come to Mexico, Billy.

522
01:04:47,824 --> 01:04:49,982
People know you're here.

523
01:04:50,785 --> 01:04:52,279
I say this as a friend.

524
01:04:52,454 --> 01:04:56,036
In old Mex he ain't gonna be nothing
but another drunken gringo...

525
01:04:56,207 --> 01:04:59,908
...shitting out chili peppers
and waiting for nothing.

526
01:05:04,841 --> 01:05:07,213
It's got a good edge.

527
01:05:12,515 --> 01:05:15,600
There's a lot of land between here
and the border.

528
01:05:15,769 --> 01:05:17,477
And it's all Chisum's.

529
01:05:17,645 --> 01:05:21,477
Better keep those sheep moving,
or they're gonna end up on his table.

530
01:05:23,985 --> 01:05:26,820
I have no quarrel with Chisum.

531
01:05:27,113 --> 01:05:29,272
It is an old war that is over.

532
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:31,358
Let him alone...

533
01:05:32,118 --> 01:05:34,526
...and he will let you alone.

534
01:05:35,372 --> 01:05:37,613
Don't you believe it, my friend.

535
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,079
I must believe it.

536
01:05:57,268 --> 01:05:59,308
<i>Adiós,</i> Paco.

537
01:06:03,441 --> 01:06:06,063
You could leave, you could live in Mexico.

538
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,644
- Could you?
- Yeah.

539
01:06:08,822 --> 01:06:11,147
I could live anywhere.

540
01:06:11,324 --> 01:06:13,862
I could leave anywhere too.

541
01:06:17,122 --> 01:06:20,740
- Have you ever been to California?
- Not yet.

542
01:06:21,084 --> 01:06:23,242
I ain't either.

543
01:06:24,045 --> 01:06:27,628
But they're sure pushing on me
to go somewhere.

544
01:06:29,634 --> 01:06:32,635
Yeah, your leaving would sure
give Garrett some size.

545
01:06:32,887 --> 01:06:36,755
I reckon he's given me
about all the time he can.

546
01:06:38,601 --> 01:06:42,017
Mexico might not be bad
for a couple of months.

547
01:06:43,148 --> 01:06:45,686
Depends on who you are.

548
01:06:48,111 --> 01:06:49,911
I reckon.

549
01:07:31,154 --> 01:07:33,859
There's a lot of us who'd ride with you.

550
01:07:39,245 --> 01:07:41,404
Mexico won't be so bad
for a few months.

551
01:07:42,707 --> 01:07:44,700
I guess that depends who you are.

552
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:49,044
But if I was y'all...

553
01:07:49,923 --> 01:07:52,461
...I'd be clearing out of here.

554
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:55,967
Gonna be some hard times
coming down.

555
01:07:59,349 --> 01:08:02,469
Remember me to whoever rides by.

556
01:08:31,214 --> 01:08:34,832
Boy, get some water for these horses.

557
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:53,518
- All right about the goddamn...
- Hello there, Lemuel.

558
01:08:56,281 --> 01:09:01,619
Well, if it ain't the limb
of the law, Patrick J. Garrett.

559
01:09:01,786 --> 01:09:05,736
Your booze is under the bar,
where I always keep it.

560
01:09:06,082 --> 01:09:09,285
Shake it up, it's got a little oil on it.

561
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:18,509
That's the fairest drink of whiskey
you'll ever throw lip over, boy.

562
01:09:20,889 --> 01:09:22,431
Know you around these parts?

563
01:09:23,933 --> 01:09:26,603
I ain't ever rode through here before.

564
01:09:35,653 --> 01:09:39,782
Don't seem the best way
to be tracking a man down.

565
01:09:39,949 --> 01:09:42,654
They're already talking about you
in Lincoln.

566
01:09:47,707 --> 01:09:51,372
I calculate you ain't been there
in more than seven weeks.

567
01:09:59,469 --> 01:10:02,636
When I want somebody
to keep time for me, I'll ask you.

568
01:10:09,145 --> 01:10:11,304
I'll stay here the night.

569
01:10:12,816 --> 01:10:17,145
You take that trail east, then south.
I'll pick you up in Roswell. Five days...

570
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,313
...six at the most.

571
01:10:25,286 --> 01:10:28,572
You might be able to find something
out there alone.

572
01:10:38,299 --> 01:10:40,506
Are you getting tired, Garrett?

573
01:10:41,344 --> 01:10:44,511
Looks like you only got
a couple more days left in you.

574
01:10:45,849 --> 01:10:49,716
Yeah, <i>well... adiós.</i>

575
01:10:58,862 --> 01:11:00,653
You want yourself a woman?

576
01:11:04,367 --> 01:11:08,780
One come here from Albuquerque, run
a cathouse over there. Name is Bertha.

577
01:11:09,581 --> 01:11:14,741
Got an ass on her like a $40 cow,
and a tit.

578
01:11:14,919 --> 01:11:17,790
I'd like to see that thing filled
full of tequila.

579
01:11:18,882 --> 01:11:22,048
Say, you know something,
you can't beat that, can you?

580
01:11:56,878 --> 01:11:58,372
Howdy, ma'am.

581
01:11:58,546 --> 01:12:00,420
Mr. Horrell.

582
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:09,173
- Hey, Tommy.
- Billy.

583
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:12,725
Didn't think we'd be getting to see you.

584
01:12:13,853 --> 01:12:17,803
I felt obliged to come
and pay my respects before moving on.

585
01:12:17,982 --> 01:12:19,856
Sit down, Bill.

586
01:12:28,952 --> 01:12:31,822
You picked a fine time to come, Billy.

587
01:12:38,628 --> 01:12:41,297
I sure never figured on you
taking on the badge.

588
01:12:41,756 --> 01:12:45,801
Didn't figure on it myself.
I was just in town being sociable.

589
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,302
Rode in from Seven Rivers
to watch you hang.

590
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:56,677
- Garrett swore me in when you lit out.
- Won't be having no ill talk at my table.

591
01:12:56,938 --> 01:12:58,480
Fill yourself, Billy.

592
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,987
Another fried pie?

593
01:13:08,575 --> 01:13:10,318
Don't mind if I do.

594
01:13:10,493 --> 01:13:13,031
Never tasted anything so good.

595
01:13:18,376 --> 01:13:20,168
Thank you, ma'am.

596
01:13:21,504 --> 01:13:22,704
Billy?

597
01:13:23,173 --> 01:13:24,573
Tomato.

598
01:13:29,554 --> 01:13:33,255
I don't suppose you ran into
old Pat, did you, Billy?

599
01:13:34,726 --> 01:13:36,101
Can't say I did.

600
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:40,348
He'll track you down, Billy, and get you.

601
01:13:41,066 --> 01:13:44,316
Pat Garrett's got more sand than most.

602
01:13:44,527 --> 01:13:47,315
Yeah, I'm outlawed, for sure.

603
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:49,612
Old Alamosa here will see to that.

604
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:57,038
It wasn't long ago, I was the law,
riding for Chisum.

605
01:13:57,415 --> 01:13:59,871
And old Pat was an outlaw.

606
01:14:03,713 --> 01:14:06,465
The law is a funny thing, ain't it?

607
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,474
Well, we best get to it.

608
01:14:21,398 --> 01:14:25,063
Just got through putting up
that new cottonwood door.

609
01:14:25,235 --> 01:14:27,560
Used the old one for my son, John.

610
01:14:28,488 --> 01:14:31,193
He got into a shooting with Olin Carroll.

611
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:33,358
He's buried out yonder there.

612
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,992
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Horrell.

613
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:41,417
John was a good hand.

614
01:14:43,086 --> 01:14:44,877
Couldn't shoot, though.

615
01:14:49,968 --> 01:14:52,755
Harley, you and Lee give me a hand
with this door.

616
01:15:10,905 --> 01:15:14,440
I don't suppose there's any other
way we could work this out?

617
01:15:20,457 --> 01:15:22,782
Well, let's get to it.

618
01:15:23,334 --> 01:15:24,994
Ten steps?

619
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:26,970
Suits me.

620
01:15:27,464 --> 01:15:29,456
You count them.

621
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:42,883
You ain't thought of another way,
have you?

622
01:15:44,689 --> 01:15:46,765
No, I can't come up with nothing.

623
01:15:48,818 --> 01:15:50,728
Get to it.

624
01:15:53,656 --> 01:15:59,493
One, two, three, four, five...

625
01:15:59,662 --> 01:16:02,070
...six, seven, eight...

626
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:24,681
That wasn't 10, hoss.

627
01:16:26,356 --> 01:16:28,894
I never could count.

628
01:16:31,611 --> 01:16:34,280
At least I'll be remembered.

629
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,082
Howdy, old-timer.

630
01:17:38,178 --> 01:17:41,132
You're wasting the best part of your day.

631
01:17:50,857 --> 01:17:52,482
Hello, Holly.

632
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:57,734
- Bit off your graze, ain't you?
- A bit.

633
01:17:59,783 --> 01:18:03,116
Hell, everybody knows
he's looking for the Kid.

634
01:18:03,703 --> 01:18:06,277
Everybody knows the Kid
ain't in this territory.

635
01:18:06,456 --> 01:18:07,867
Nobody's seen him.

636
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:11,077
Maybe he be outside there.
I wish he'd come get a drink.

637
01:18:11,252 --> 01:18:13,494
Get himself a drink?

638
01:18:13,838 --> 01:18:16,792
Yeah. Well, I had mine.

639
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:19,457
No need to run off, Holly.

640
01:18:34,567 --> 01:18:37,237
He ain't out there, Pat.

641
01:18:39,197 --> 01:18:42,447
You boys shuck them gun belts.
Let them lay where they fall.

642
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:58,415
- You boys carrying wages?
- What kind of wages do you mean?

643
01:18:58,925 --> 01:19:02,341
Well, any kind of wages.
Thought maybe we'd just have a few...

644
01:19:02,846 --> 01:19:04,969
...sociable hands.

645
01:19:17,277 --> 01:19:19,186
Ain't no harm in being sociable.

646
01:19:19,362 --> 01:19:21,154
Ain't no harm in being sociable.

647
01:19:26,453 --> 01:19:27,653
Boy...

648
01:19:28,538 --> 01:19:31,290
...go over there to Lemuel
and get that shotgun...

649
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:35,290
...he's got his fingers wrapped around
and bring it to me, stock first.

650
01:19:36,337 --> 01:19:37,537
Do it!

651
01:19:41,885 --> 01:19:45,218
It ain't no use, you getting mad.
I wasn't set on using that.

652
01:19:45,388 --> 01:19:48,058
But those boys have been
patronizing me real well.

653
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:53,016
No use getting him mad, old Pat.
We been patronizing him real well.

654
01:19:56,566 --> 01:20:00,017
Now, I want you to stand over
behind breed here.

655
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:08,607
Take the stock of that gun and rap him
smartly on the back of the head.

656
01:20:09,245 --> 01:20:12,282
Do it, or this bullet
that's going through his chest...

657
01:20:12,457 --> 01:20:16,289
...is liable to come out the other side
and tickle your private parts.

658
01:20:16,461 --> 01:20:17,659
Private parts?

659
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:36,805
- Lemuel.
- Yeah?

660
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:41,105
I want you to drag your fat ass over here
so we can all see you.

661
01:20:41,778 --> 01:20:44,732
You're crazier than a mule-humping goat.

662
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:49,196
Sitting there with all that law crammed
inside of you, busting to get out.

663
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:54,744
I wouldn't give a sweet jerk in hell
if the Kid did lay you out.

664
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:59,794
You used to be just like a daddy
to that boy.

665
01:21:00,797 --> 01:21:01,797
Boy.

666
01:21:07,804 --> 01:21:09,631
Come over here.

667
01:21:11,975 --> 01:21:16,055
Take Lemuel's hat and stuff it down
over his eyes, gentle-like.

668
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:21,357
Those eyes ain't seen nothing but bad
since he's been in this territory.

669
01:21:21,526 --> 01:21:23,684
And I'm looking right smack-dab at it.

670
01:21:33,705 --> 01:21:37,038
Now, I want you to go over there
to that shelf of airtights...

671
01:21:37,834 --> 01:21:42,496
...and give us a nice read,
loud enough for us all to hear.

672
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:55,849
Let's hear it!

673
01:21:56,728 --> 01:21:59,528
"Beans. Beans.

674
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:01,310
Spinach.

675
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:04,283
Eastern plums.

676
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:08,353
Beans. Beef stew. Salmon."

677
01:22:08,531 --> 01:22:10,524
- Two is a better game.
- "Pears."

678
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:15,447
Listen, Pat, we haven't done nothing.

679
01:22:15,705 --> 01:22:20,866
All we did was come in
and wet ourselves down.

680
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:25,374
- "Spinach."
- Take it right from the bottle, Holly.

681
01:22:25,799 --> 01:22:27,209
"Beef stew."

682
01:22:27,717 --> 01:22:30,718
No need to stand on manners
around here.

683
01:22:33,973 --> 01:22:36,927
No, no, no.
Go ahead, have another one there.

684
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:40,059
"Climax tobacco."

685
01:22:41,106 --> 01:22:42,979
Just keep on going there.

686
01:22:43,733 --> 01:22:47,778
"AMK fine quality tomatoes."

687
01:22:48,154 --> 01:22:52,152
He's trying to drown you. That's what.
Trying to get his bark back on him.

688
01:22:52,409 --> 01:22:55,244
Thinks it's going to make him young,
like the Kid.

689
01:22:55,412 --> 01:22:56,954
"AMK salmon."

690
01:22:57,914 --> 01:23:01,034
"Beans. Spinach and beans."

691
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:03,249
"Baked beans."

692
01:23:04,587 --> 01:23:05,630
"Beans."

693
01:23:05,797 --> 01:23:11,503
- Boy, this sure lights up and kill you.
- "Baked beans."

694
01:23:12,971 --> 01:23:14,571
"Beans."

695
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:22,390
"Quality."

696
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:29,067
"Quality."

697
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:32,773
"Beef stew."

698
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,243
Tell me, Pat.

699
01:23:39,664 --> 01:23:43,792
Are you afraid to take it
to the Kid, or what?

700
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:47,589
Ever since you and the Kid
have been together...

701
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:53,295
...you've just been a little short
of supplies, you know what I mean?

702
01:23:55,638 --> 01:23:57,631
"Lima beans."

703
01:23:57,849 --> 01:23:59,474
Oh, hell.

704
01:24:02,145 --> 01:24:04,303
I don't care about either one of you.

705
01:24:05,148 --> 01:24:09,395
"Lard. Quality... Quality salmon."

706
01:24:33,843 --> 01:24:38,055
"Plums. Beans. Tomatoes."

707
01:24:38,223 --> 01:24:41,639
You just made me have a bowel
movement in my britches, Garrett.

708
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:44,016
I ain't gonna never forgive you
for this.

709
01:24:44,187 --> 01:24:47,188
"Succotash. Beets."

710
01:24:47,691 --> 01:24:49,691
"Spinach."

711
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:51,485
Boy.

712
01:24:53,863 --> 01:24:55,144
When you see Billy...

713
01:24:58,868 --> 01:25:03,945
...tell him we had a little drink together.

714
01:25:21,933 --> 01:25:22,933
No!

715
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,060
No!

716
01:25:25,729 --> 01:25:27,129
No. No.

717
01:25:32,652 --> 01:25:34,312
It's ready.

718
01:25:51,004 --> 01:25:52,913
Jesus Christ!

719
01:25:54,257 --> 01:25:55,502
You working for Chisum?

720
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:59,256
Yeah. We're working for him.

721
01:26:05,185 --> 01:26:07,585
Hello, Paco.

722
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:23,202
I will tell you about a house
that I want to build.

723
01:26:24,454 --> 01:26:25,996
No, not here.

724
01:26:26,164 --> 01:26:27,955
For <i>us, amigo.</i>

725
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:31,074
It will be on the other side.

726
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:33,292
In old Mex.

727
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:36,209
I will sell my sheep.

728
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:39,961
And I will build the adobe bridge myself.

729
01:26:40,136 --> 01:26:42,045
You know, Billy...

730
01:26:43,056 --> 01:26:45,013
...I'll put a vine...

731
01:26:45,183 --> 01:26:48,018
...a grapevine out on the veranda...

732
01:26:48,186 --> 01:26:50,642
...and I will have three chairs...

733
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:53,685
...and I will sit in the middle one.

734
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:57,104
And anyone who doesn't do right...

735
01:26:57,278 --> 01:27:00,778
...according to nature and my mother...

736
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:03,404
...I will blow his head off.

737
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,571
Billy...

738
01:27:09,999 --> 01:27:12,325
<i>Cómo te sientes tú,</i> Billy?

739
01:27:23,221 --> 01:27:25,095
Well, that ties it.

740
01:27:25,265 --> 01:27:27,341
I'm going back.

741
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:25,779
Look who's here.

742
01:28:26,242 --> 01:28:28,282
Hey, look who's here!

743
01:28:38,129 --> 01:28:41,379
I was hoping that was you
as soon as I seen your dust.

744
01:28:41,841 --> 01:28:44,167
Well, I was hoping that was you.

745
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:47,717
I ain't shut of this country yet.

746
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,846
I should have knowed better.

747
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:52,250
Beaver.

748
01:28:52,936 --> 01:28:54,763
Goddamn glad to see you, buddy.

749
01:28:56,022 --> 01:29:00,850
You boys look grim. You need somebody
back here to spur your flanks, don't you?

750
01:29:02,153 --> 01:29:05,107
You just give us the word.
There's enough of us left.

751
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:08,399
Nobody's running us off.

752
01:29:10,495 --> 01:29:12,286
Not Garrett...

753
01:29:13,289 --> 01:29:14,748
...Chisum...

754
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:17,746
...or that goddamn governor.

755
01:29:21,172 --> 01:29:23,414
Chisum killed Paco.

756
01:29:34,811 --> 01:29:36,471
Hello, Rupert.

757
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:41,644
Take your old room.

758
01:29:41,818 --> 01:29:43,146
Key's in the door.

759
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:45,146
Oh, Rupert...

760
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:48,650
...what ladies do you have
hosting for you nowadays?

761
01:29:54,497 --> 01:29:58,661
We just got some sort of an octoroon
from south Texas...

762
01:29:58,835 --> 01:30:01,871
...and there's Ruthie Lee and Pauline.

763
01:30:02,922 --> 01:30:05,164
Well, I'll be up in Ruthie Lee's room.

764
01:30:05,675 --> 01:30:07,169
She won't want to see you.

765
01:30:07,343 --> 01:30:09,716
She's been with the Kid
more than a few times.

766
01:30:09,888 --> 01:30:11,679
Well, send her up anyway.

767
01:30:12,724 --> 01:30:14,004
You want another one?

768
01:30:14,184 --> 01:30:16,176
I don't care who you send up, Rupert.

769
01:30:16,353 --> 01:30:19,935
Just make sure that Ruthie Lee's
part of the package.

770
01:30:28,031 --> 01:30:29,490
Come in.

771
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:45,373
- Hello, Ruthie.
- Which way do you wanna go?

772
01:30:48,218 --> 01:30:49,712
I don't know yet.

773
01:31:00,397 --> 01:31:02,473
Gotta ask a few questions first.

774
01:31:04,567 --> 01:31:08,150
He was here a few weeks ago.
I don't know where he went.

775
01:31:11,574 --> 01:31:13,900
Better do better than that, Ruthie.

776
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:24,497
You're gonna have to do me one more
time, because I owe the Kid that much.

777
01:31:34,764 --> 01:31:36,721
Now you tell me.

778
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:40,684
Fort Sumner.

779
01:32:21,811 --> 01:32:23,471
Excuse me.

780
01:32:27,192 --> 01:32:29,434
Clean it off real good, now.

781
01:32:39,954 --> 01:32:42,196
We're getting to the best part.

782
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:46,493
You gotta pull hard there.
They been on for a long time.

783
01:32:48,546 --> 01:32:49,546
Yeah.

784
01:32:55,428 --> 01:32:58,133
Oh, yes. How is that tub?

785
01:32:59,849 --> 01:33:01,925
Having a little trouble there, girls?

786
01:33:05,814 --> 01:33:07,014
Jesus.

787
01:34:01,077 --> 01:34:02,406
What room is Garrett in?

788
01:34:04,247 --> 01:34:06,074
End of the hall.

789
01:34:16,009 --> 01:34:17,052
Garrett?

790
01:34:20,263 --> 01:34:22,552
Come on in. The door's not locked.

791
01:34:28,188 --> 01:34:29,812
Well, where's he at?

792
01:34:32,025 --> 01:34:33,567
Fort Sumner.

793
01:34:34,110 --> 01:34:36,897
Yeah, well, I don't wanna hear about that.

794
01:34:38,823 --> 01:34:40,816
If you don't get him, I'm going to.

795
01:34:44,788 --> 01:34:48,453
Go down to the sheriff's office
and find Kip McKinney.

796
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:51,165
Tell him to meet me downstairs.

797
01:34:51,336 --> 01:34:54,290
Don't say nothing about nothing.

798
01:35:28,039 --> 01:35:29,831
Thank you, Rupert.

799
01:35:38,633 --> 01:35:40,590
Your jail empty?

800
01:35:41,511 --> 01:35:43,967
I recollect that it is.

801
01:35:44,139 --> 01:35:46,843
- Who's your deputy?
- Sack Oliver.

802
01:35:48,059 --> 01:35:50,218
Well, I got the girls upstairs.

803
01:35:50,395 --> 01:35:51,510
Locked up.

804
01:35:54,941 --> 01:35:58,392
Take the girls over to see
old Sack Oliver.

805
01:35:59,529 --> 01:36:01,320
Give him the key.

806
01:36:02,407 --> 01:36:04,649
Go on, give him the key.

807
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:15,617
And then bring Mr. McKinney's
horse back. All right, Poe?

808
01:36:29,893 --> 01:36:32,348
Where are we going anyway?

809
01:36:33,063 --> 01:36:34,889
Fort Sumner.

810
01:36:35,065 --> 01:36:38,231
There ain't nothing out there
but some old cattle thieves.

811
01:36:41,738 --> 01:36:45,023
Well, there's a couple
of young ones there too.

812
01:36:57,087 --> 01:36:59,412
No, I ain't going.

813
01:37:05,011 --> 01:37:07,051
You owe it to me.

814
01:37:07,764 --> 01:37:10,172
I do? For what?

815
01:37:10,350 --> 01:37:13,600
For not killing you over at Rosewater...

816
01:37:13,978 --> 01:37:16,766
...for getting you this job...

817
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,682
...and not seeing you run out of here.

818
01:37:19,859 --> 01:37:23,774
For pulling you out of that snowdrift
up at Chamas.

819
01:37:24,572 --> 01:37:27,823
For coldcocking you over at
Stillwater's saloon last fall...

820
01:37:27,992 --> 01:37:32,073
...and saving you from Rabbit Owen's
biting off your ear and from just...

821
01:37:32,706 --> 01:37:36,288
...putting up with you for a hell of a lot
longer than I ought to.

822
01:37:41,589 --> 01:37:42,589
Yeah.

823
01:37:44,509 --> 01:37:45,909
Well...

824
01:37:47,137 --> 01:37:50,636
...I hope they spell my name right
in the papers.

825
01:38:18,209 --> 01:38:19,409
Billy.

826
01:38:20,754 --> 01:38:22,877
Cut the dust.

827
01:38:39,189 --> 01:38:40,517
He's coming in, Billy.

828
01:38:45,779 --> 01:38:47,570
Yeah, I reckon.

829
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:52,034
Maybe he wants
to have a drink with me.

830
01:39:24,567 --> 01:39:26,893
I'd just as soon ride in,
get it over with.

831
01:39:27,070 --> 01:39:29,228
He ain't gonna be there anyway.

832
01:39:29,739 --> 01:39:32,574
Hell, I don't have nothing
against the Kid...

833
01:39:33,076 --> 01:39:36,361
...saving maybe he killed J.W. Bell.

834
01:39:36,538 --> 01:39:37,538
Yeah.

835
01:39:38,623 --> 01:39:40,948
I sure did like J.W.

836
01:39:41,126 --> 01:39:44,958
We'll meet up on the other side of
the fort, at Pete Maxwell's place.

837
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:47,087
I know old Pete.

838
01:40:37,599 --> 01:40:39,508
Hello, Pete.

839
01:40:45,982 --> 01:40:48,354
Heard you were back.

840
01:40:53,365 --> 01:40:54,965
Obliged.

841
01:41:00,163 --> 01:41:03,413
We'd like to bed down
in your extra bunk.

842
01:41:07,253 --> 01:41:10,836
No reason not to. I got no need for it.

843
01:41:14,928 --> 01:41:16,671
Been on any drives?

844
01:41:18,181 --> 01:41:19,181
No.

845
01:41:23,645 --> 01:41:25,353
I recollect the time...

846
01:41:25,689 --> 01:41:28,180
...Toddy Sparks got his horse stole.

847
01:41:29,526 --> 01:41:31,399
Jace Summers stole it.

848
01:41:31,569 --> 01:41:33,977
Just up and stole it.

849
01:41:34,823 --> 01:41:37,148
It was up by Del Rio.

850
01:41:39,285 --> 01:41:41,693
Old Toddy got even, though.

851
01:41:41,871 --> 01:41:43,947
He sure did.

852
01:41:45,625 --> 01:41:48,875
Put a rattler in Jace's blanket.

853
01:41:51,089 --> 01:41:53,662
Bit him through the neck.

854
01:41:55,552 --> 01:41:58,221
Buried him in a thunderstorm.

855
01:41:58,555 --> 01:42:01,639
Summer of '71 it was.

856
01:43:18,259 --> 01:43:20,881
Man, what are you,
some kind of frog-watcher?

857
01:43:21,054 --> 01:43:22,714
Take it easy. Wrong room.

858
01:43:22,889 --> 01:43:25,214
You're goddamn right
you got the wrong room.

859
01:43:25,433 --> 01:43:28,138
- Who in the hell you looking for?
- Somebody else.

860
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:29,978
What somebody else?

861
01:44:23,241 --> 01:44:24,949
It's cold.

862
01:44:27,912 --> 01:44:29,912
It's cold.

863
01:44:34,669 --> 01:44:36,578
Hello, Will.

864
01:44:37,422 --> 01:44:39,082
Hello, sheriff.

865
01:44:46,514 --> 01:44:49,219
You finally figured it out, huh?

866
01:44:53,813 --> 01:44:56,055
Go on, get it over with.

867
01:45:26,096 --> 01:45:27,296
Jesus.

868
01:45:44,656 --> 01:45:45,856
Jesus.

869
01:45:49,077 --> 01:45:50,277
Jesus.

870
01:46:57,937 --> 01:47:00,096
I'm hungry.

871
01:47:00,273 --> 01:47:01,815
I'll get you something.

872
01:47:01,983 --> 01:47:05,648
No, I'll just see what Pete's got out
in the cooler.

873
01:48:18,018 --> 01:48:20,888
That's the Kid, Tex. Right there.

874
01:48:22,105 --> 01:48:24,181
Go on, shoot him. Go on, shoot him.

875
01:48:47,589 --> 01:48:50,376
Go on, shoot him.

876
01:48:53,219 --> 01:48:54,464
Who's that?

877
01:48:57,807 --> 01:48:59,052
Who the hell are you?

878
01:49:04,022 --> 01:49:05,564
Hello, Pete.

879
01:49:07,484 --> 01:49:08,812
Evening, Pat.

880
01:49:09,944 --> 01:49:13,148
Easy. We come to see Pete Maxwell.

881
01:49:14,783 --> 01:49:17,321
You chickenshit bastard.

882
01:49:23,583 --> 01:49:25,741
Hey, Pete, who's that out there?

883
01:50:28,648 --> 01:50:30,059
I want his trigger finger!

884
01:50:30,358 --> 01:50:34,901
I want it cut off and nailed to a post!
Then I want him taken back to Lincoln!

885
01:50:36,197 --> 01:50:37,197
No!

886
