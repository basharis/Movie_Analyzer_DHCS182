1
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:05,607
<i>Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.</i>

2
00:00:05,676 --> 00:00:07,109
<i>She showed me around</i>

3
00:00:07,177 --> 00:00:10,112
<i>and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.</i>

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,613
Shut that blind, man!

5
00:00:11,682 --> 00:00:14,617
And get your white ass
away from that window.

6
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:15,917
Don't you know we in a war here?

7
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:16,975
Don't you know we in a war here?

8
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,951
He's cool.
He's one of us.

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,954
Let me tell you about us.

10
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:23,957
Our purpose here is
to protect our black leaders

11
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:26,493
from the racial
onslaught of the pig

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,393
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

13
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,660
rape our women, and destroy
our black communities.

14
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,132
Who's the baby killer?

15
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,136
This is my good friend
I told you about.

16
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,139
This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley.

17
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,641
Wesley and I
lived together in Berkeley,

18
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,645
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

19
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,648
We are here to offer
protection and help

20
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,150
for all those
who need our help,

21
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,651
because we,
the Black Panthers,

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,654
are against the war in Vietnam.

23
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,155
We are against any war

24
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,158
where black soldiers
are sent to the front line

25
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,161
to die for a country
that hates them.

26
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,165
We are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

27
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,760
and come to be brutalized and
killed in their own communities.

28
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:12,738
We are against
these racist and imperial acts...

29
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,506
~ And I gave her the gun ~

30
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,170
~ I shot her ~

31
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,738
Forrest!

32
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:24,011
Stop it!

33
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,575
Stop it!

34
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:27,916
Forrest!

35
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,389
Stop it! Stop it!

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,634
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

37
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:46,401
I should have known it was going
to be some bullshit hassle!

38
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:49,034
He should not be
hitting you, Jenny.

39
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:56,046
Come on, Forrest.

40
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:05,990
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

41
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,595
He doesn't mean it
when he does things like this.

42
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,132
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

43
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,002
I know you wouldn't,
Forrest.

44
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,768
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

45
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,413
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

46
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,121
You look handsome in it.

47
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,920
You do.

48
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,629
You know what?

49
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,790
What?

50
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:52,535
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

51
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,632
Me, too, Forrest.

52
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,167
<i>We walked around
all night, Jenny and me,</i>

53
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,179
<i>just talkin'.</i>

54
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:06,014
<i>She told me about
all the traveling she'd done</i>

55
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,954
<i>and how she discovered
ways to expand her mind</i>

56
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,627
<i>and learn how
to live in harmony...</i>

57
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,660
<i>which must be
out west somewhere,</i>

58
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,664
<i>'cause she made it
all the way to California.</i>

59
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,666
~ Love one another right now ~

60
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:21,666
Hey.

61
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,034
Anybody want to go
to San Francisco?

62
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:26,572
I'll go.

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,971
Far out!

64
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,475
<i>It was a very special night</i>

65
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,238
<i>for the two of us.</i>

66
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,881
<i>I didn't want it to end.</i>

67
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,915
Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

68
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,710
I have to, Forrest.

69
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,121
Jenny?

70
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,621
Things got
a little out of hand.

71
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,287
It's just this war

72
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,127
and that lying
son of a bitch Johnson and...

73
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,401
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

74
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,106
Know what I think?

75
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,543
I think...

76
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,637
you should go home to Greenbow,

77
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,705
Alabama!

78
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,091
Forrest,

79
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,856
we have very
different lives, you know.

80
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,674
I want you...

81
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,835
to have this.

82
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,672
Forrest, I can't keep this.

83
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,118
I got it...

84
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,520
just by doing
what you told me to do.

85
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:55,457
Why are you so good to me?

86
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,359
You're my girl.

87
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,194
I'll always be your girl.

88
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:29,084
~ To everything,
turn, turn, turn ~

89
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,656
~ There is a season,
turn, turn, turn ~

90
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,499
~ And a time to every purpose ~

91
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,595
~ Under heaven ~

92
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:43,607
<i>And just like that,</i>

93
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,635
<i>she was gone
out of my life again.</i>

94
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,680
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

95
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,483
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

96
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,128
<i>I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,</i>

97
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,629
<i>but instead they decided</i>

98
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,632
<i>the best way for me
to fight the Communists</i>

99
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,133
<i>was to play Ping-Pong,</i>

100
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,136
<i>so I was in the Special Services,</i>

101
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,796
<i>traveling around the country,</i>

102
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,500
<i>cheering up wounded veterans
and showing 'em</i>

103
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,133
how to play Ping-Pong.

104
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,179
I was so good
that some years later,

105
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,146
<i>the army decided I should be</i>

106
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,376
<i>on the all-American Ping-Pong team.</i>

107
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,715
<i>We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China</i>

108
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,187
<i>in a million years or something.</i>

109
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,191
<i>Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,</i>

110
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,955
<i>but all I did was play Ping-Pong.</i>

111
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,896
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity,

112
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,865
famouser even
than Captain Kangaroo.

113
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,034
<i>Here he is, Forrest Gump.</i>

114
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,467
<i>Right here.</i>

115
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,279
<i>Gump, have a seat.</i>

116
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,110
<i>Forrest Gump, John Lennon.</i>

117
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,116
<i>Welcome home.</i>

118
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,118
<i>Can you tell us, um,</i>

119
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,313
<i>what was China like?</i>

120
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,617
<i>In the land of China...</i>

121
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,628
<i>people hardly got nothin'at all.</i>

122
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,857
<i>No possessions?</i>

123
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:19,135
<i>And in China,
they never go to church.</i>

124
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,638
<i>No religion, too?</i>

125
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,641
<i>Oh.</i>

126
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,301
<i>Hard to imagine.</i>

127
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,642
<i>Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.</i>

128
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,147
<i>Some years later,</i>

129
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,149
<i>that nice young man from England</i>

130
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,186
<i>was on his way home
to see his little boy</i>

131
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,154
<i>and was signing some autographs.</i>

132
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,087
<i>For no particular reason at all,</i>

133
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,625
<i>somebody shot him.</i>

134
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,096
They gave you...

135
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,155
the congressional Medal of Honor.

136
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,365
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

137
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,898
Lieutenant Dan!

138
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,839
They gave you...

139
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,936
the congressional
Medal of Honor.

140
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,114
Yes, sir.
They surely did.

141
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,013
They gave you,

142
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,608
an imbecile,

143
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,620
a moron who goes on television

144
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,122
and makes a fool out of himself

145
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,159
in front of
the whole damn country,

146
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,559
the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

147
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,929
Yes, sir.

148
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,431
<i>Well... that...
that's just perfect!</i>

149
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,201
Yeah, well, I just got
one thing to say to that...

150
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,640
Goddamn bless America.

151
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,176
Hey, hey!

152
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,235
Whoa...

153
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,976
Oh, God, whoa!

154
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,814
Ow! Oh! Oh, God!

155
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,513
Lieutenant Dan!

156
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,579
<i>Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel</i>

157
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,592
<i>and because he didn't
have no legs,</i>

158
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,595
<i>he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.</i>

159
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,599
Make a right. Take a right!

160
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,602
Hey!

161
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,865
Ah, ah!

162
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,602
What do you do here
in New York, Lieutenant Dan?

163
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,110
I'm living off
the government tit.

165
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,608
Hey, hey, hey, are you blind?

166
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,117
I'm walking here!

167
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,619
Ah, get out!

168
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,348
Come on. Go, go, go!

<i>[Singing Silent Night]</i>

170
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,121
<i>I stayed with Lieutenant Dan</i>

171
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,529
<i>and celebrated the holidays.</i>

172
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,199
<i>You have a great year,

00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,967
<i>God bless you.</i>

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,338
Have you found
Jesus yet, Gump?

175
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,649
I didn't know I was supposed
to be looking for Him, sir.

176
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:55,115
That's all these cripples
down at the V. A...

177
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,595
That's all they ever
talk about.

178
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:02,896
Jesus this
and Jesus that. Ha.

179
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,461
Have I... found Jesus?

180
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,975
They even had a priest
come and talk to me.

181
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,603
He said God is listening,

182
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,613
but I have to help myself.

183
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,616
Now, if I accept Jesus
into my heart,

184
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:23,121
I'll get to walk beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.

185
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,419
Did you hear what I said?

186
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,489
Walk...

187
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,121
beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.

188
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,631
Well... kiss my crippled ass.

189
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,633
God is listening?

190
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,760
What a crock of shit.

191
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,197
I'm going to heaven,
Lieutenant Dan.

192
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:46,643
Oh?

193
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,445
Well...

194
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,578
before you go...
why don't you

195
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,091
get your ass
down to the corner

196
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:00,885
and get us more Ripple?

197
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:01,983
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,493
<i>We're at approximately</i>

199
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,656
<i>45th Street in New York City
at One Astor Plaza.</i>

200
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:08,665
<i>This is the site of the old...</i>

201
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,167
What the hell is
in Bayou La Batre?

202
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,669
Shrimping boats.

203
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:16,173
Shrimping boats? Who gives
a shit about shrimping boats?

204
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:18,175
I got to buy me one

205
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,177
soon as I have some money.

206
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:21,678
I promised Bubba in Vietnam

207
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:25,182
that as soon as the war
was over, we'd be partners.

208
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,686
He'd be the captain
and I'd be his first mate.

209
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:31,688
But now that he's dead,
I got to be the captain.

210
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:33,690
A shrimp boat captain.

211
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:36,852
Yes, sir. A promise
is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

212
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,131
Now hear this!

213
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:42,632
Private Gump here

214
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,135
is gonna be
a shrimp boat captain.

215
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,137
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan.

216
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:50,140
The day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

217
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,143
I will come and be
your first mate.

218
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:54,644
Ha ha ha!

219
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,648
If you're ever
a shrimp boat captain,

220
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,650
that's the day
I'm an astronaut!

221
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,652
Danny, what are you
complaining about?

222
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,153
Danny, how you doing, huh?

223
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,654
Mr. Hot Wheels!

224
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,156
Who's your friend?

225
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:08,692
My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

226
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,194
This is cunning Carla

227
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,197
and long-limbs Lenore.

228
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,165
So where you been,
babycakes, huh?

229
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,167
Haven't seen you
around lately.

230
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,669
You should have been here
for Christmas,

231
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,672
'cause Tommy bought a free round

232
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,674
and gave everybody
a turkey sandwich.

233
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,676
Well, well,
I had, uh... company.

234
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,678
Hey! Hey, we was just there!

235
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,680
That's like Times Square.

236
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,182
Don't you just love New Year's?

237
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,684
You can start all over.

238
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,687
Everybody gets a second chance.

239
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,120
<i>It's funny...</i>

240
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,125
<i>but in the middle
of all that fun,</i>

241
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,024
<i>I began to think about Jenny,</i>

242
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:46,530
<i>wondering how she was
spending her New Year's night</i>

243
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,260
<i>out in California.</i>

244
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:52,633
~ Don't you love her ways? ~

245
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:55,798
~ Tell me what you say ~

246
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:58,968
~ Don't you love her madly? ~

247
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,138
~ Want to meet her daddy? ~

248
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,274
~ Don't you love her face? ~

249
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,151
~ Don't you love her
as she's walkin' out the door? ~

250
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,655
<i>9... 8...</i>

251
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:13,657
<i>7... 6...</i>

252
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,659
<i>5... 4...</i>

253
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:17,194
<i>3... 2...</i>

254
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:18,194
<i>1!</i>

255
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:20,458
<i>[Crowd]
Happy new year!</i>

256
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,327
[Toot]

257
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:34,178
~ Should auld acquaintance
be forgot ~

258
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,181
~ And never brought to mind ~

259
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,116
Happy new year, Lieutenant Dan!

260
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:44,884
~ Should auld acquaintance
be forgot ~

261
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:49,916
~ In days of auld lang syne ~

262
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,528
~ Together we stand ~

263
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:03,267
~ Divided we fall ~

264
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:05,434
~ Come on now, people, let's ~

265
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,442
~ Get on the ball ~

266
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:08,741
~ And work together ~

267
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,542
~ Come on, come on ~

268
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,276
~ Let's work together ~

269
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:17,153
Oh! What are you,
stupid or something?

270
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,655
What's your problem?

271
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:20,156
What's his problem?

272
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:23,160
Did you lose your packet
in the war or something?

273
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:25,162
Is your friend
stupid or something?

274
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,663
What did you say?

275
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:29,165
I said is your friend
stupid or something?

276
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,496
Don't call him stupid!

277
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:32,001
Hey, don't push her!

278
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,094
You shut up!

279
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:35,071
Don't you ever call him stupid!

280
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,472
Come on, baby,
why you being so upset, huh?

281
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,702
Get your goddamned clothes

282
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,211
and get the hell out of here!

283
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,110
You should be in a sideshow.

284
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,307
You're so pathetic!

285
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:45,872
Get out of here!

286
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,383
You big guy!

287
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:49,420
Loser. You freak!

288
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:55,853
Oh, no. No.

289
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,152
I'm sorry I ruined

290
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,155
your New Year's Eve party,
Lieutenant Dan.

291
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:27,555
She tastes like cigarettes.

292
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,609
<i>I guess Lieutenant Dan figured</i>

293
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:48,612
<i>there's some things
you just can't change.</i>

294
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,615
<i>He didn't want
to be called crippled</i>

295
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:55,119
<i>just like I didn't
want to be called stupid.</i>

296
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,317
Happy new year, Gump.

297
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:07,622
<i>The U.S. Ping-Pong team</i>

298
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,132
<i>met with President Nixon today...</i>

299
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,827
Wouldn't you know it?

300
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,631
A few months later,

301
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,639
they invited me
and the Ping-Pong team

302
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:17,140
to visit the White House.

303
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,607
So I went...

304
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:19,836
again.

305
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:23,711
And I met the president
of the United States again.

306
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,342
<i>Only this time,
they didn't get us rooms</i>

307
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,147
<i>in a real fancy hotel.</i>

308
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:29,652
<i>Are you enjoying yourself</i>

309
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,655
<i>in our nation's capital,
young man?</i>

310
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:33,156
<i>Where are you staying?</i>

311
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:34,657
<i>It's called the Hotel Ebbott.</i>

312
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:37,661
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
I know a much nicer hotel.</i>

313
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,094
<i>It's brand-new. Very modern.</i>

314
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,792
<i>I'll have my people
take care of it.</i>

315
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:43,094
Security.

316
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,601
Yeah. Sir,

317
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,604
you might want to send
a maintenance man

318
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:50,106
over to that office
across the way.

319
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,608
The lights are off

320
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,611
and they must be looking
for a fuse box,

321
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:57,614
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

322
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,616
O.K., sir.
I'll check it out.

323
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:00,981
Thank you. Good night.

324
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,622
<i>Therefore...</i>

325
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,624
<i>I shall resign the presidency</i>

326
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,956
<i>effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

327
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,962
<i>Vice President Ford</i>

328
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,123
<i>will be sworn in as president</i>

329
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,861
<i>at that hour in this office.</i>

330
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,446
Forrest Gump.

331
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:31,141
Yes, sir!

332
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,649
As you were.

333
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:34,651
I have your discharge papers.

334
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,380
Service is up, son.

335
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:41,955
Does this mean I can't
play Ping-Pong no more?

336
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:43,994
For the army, it does.

337
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,098
<i>And just like that,</i>

338
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,602
<i>my service in
the United States Army was over.</i>

339
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:58,142
<i>So I went home.</i>

340
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:21,355
I'm home, Mama.

341
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,832
I know. I know.

342
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:26,636
Louise, he's here.

343
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:29,639
<i>Now, when I got home,
I had no idea,</i>

344
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:32,141
<i>but Mama had all sorts
of visitors.</i>

345
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,144
We've had all sorts of visitors.

346
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:37,648
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

347
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:40,582
One man even left
a check for $25,000

348
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,088
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you like using their paddle.

349
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:47,090
I only like using
my own paddle.

350
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,557
Hi, Miss Louise.

351
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:49,615
Hey, Forrest.

352
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:52,595
I know that,
but it's $25,000, Forrest.

353
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:56,100
I thought maybe
you could hold it for a while,

354
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,601
see if it grows on you.

355
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,604
<i>That Mama, she sure was right.</i>

356
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,407
<i>It's funny how things work out.</i>

357
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,440
<i>I didn't stay home for long</i>

358
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:07,943
<i>because I'd made
a promise to Bubba,</i>

359
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:10,445
<i>and I always try
to keep my promise,</i>

360
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:12,948
<i>so I went on down
to Bayou La Batre</i>

361
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:14,506
<i>to meet Bubba's family.</i>

362
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:18,987
Are you crazy
or just plain stupid?

363
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:22,286
Stupid is as stupid does,
Mrs. Blue.

364
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,291
I guess.

365
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,793
<i>And, of course,</i>

366
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:27,955
<i>I paid my respect
to Bubba himself.</i>

367
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,861
Hey, Bubba.
It's me, Forrest Gump.

368
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,139
I remember everything
you said,

369
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:40,074
and I got it
all figured out.

370
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:48,378
I'm taking $24,562.47

371
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:50,579
that I got, that's left

372
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:53,088
<i>after a new haircut
and a new suit</i>

373
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:56,091
<i>and took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,</i>

374
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,026
<i>and I bought a bus ticket,
then three Dr. Peppers.</i>

375
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:01,086
Tell me something.

376
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:03,598
Are you stupid or something?

377
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,363
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

378
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:08,370
That's what's left
after me saying,

379
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:12,374
"When I was in China on
the all-America Ping-Pong team,

380
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:14,376
"I just loved
playing Ping-Pong

381
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:16,571
with my Flex-O-Lite
Ping-Pong paddle,"

382
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:18,580
which everybody knows isn't true,

383
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:21,583
but Mama said it was just
a little white lie,

384
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:23,585
so it wasn't hurting nobody.

385
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:26,087
So anyway,
I'm putting all that

386
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:28,590
on gas, ropes, and new nets

387
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:31,593
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

388
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:56,152
<i>Now Bubba told me everything
he knew about shrimping,</i>

389
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:59,154
<i>but you know what I found out?</i>

390
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:02,783
<i>Shrimping is tough.</i>

391
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:07,390
I only caught five.

392
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:10,900
A couple more,
you can have yourself a cocktail.

393
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:15,671
Hey, you ever think about
naming this old boat?

394
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:18,674
It's bad luck to have
a boat without a name.

395
00:21:18,742 --> 00:21:21,176
<i>I'd never named a boat before,</i>

396
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:26,272
<i>but there was only one
I could think of,</i>

397
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:30,308
<i>the most beautiful name
in the wide world.</i>

398
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:35,881
<i>~ Do a little dance ~</i>

399
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,927
<i>~ Make a little love ~</i>

400
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:39,928
<i>~ Get down tonight ~</i>

401
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:42,294
<i>~ Get down tonight ~</i>

402
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:44,560
<i>~ Do a little dance ~</i>

403
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:46,397
<i>~ Make a little love ~</i>

404
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:48,096
<i>~ Get down tonight ~</i>

405
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:49,263
<i>~ Whoo ~</i>

406
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:50,636
<i>~ Get down tonight... ~</i>

407
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:53,107
<i>Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny</i>

408
00:21:53,176 --> 00:21:54,473
<i>in a long while,</i>

409
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:56,978
<i>but I thought about her a lot.</i>

410
00:21:57,047 --> 00:22:00,141
<i>I hoped whatever
she was doing made her happy.</i>

411
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:05,244
~ Oh, and the bird
you cannot change ~

412
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:15,393
~ And this bird
you cannot change ~

413
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:22,837
~ Lord knows I can't change ~

414
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:29,835
~ Lord, help me, I can't change ~

415
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:49,491
<i>I thought about Jenny all the time.</i>

416
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:14,908
Hey!

417
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:43,037
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

418
00:24:43,112 --> 00:24:46,479
Well, thought
I'd try out my sea legs.

419
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:49,484
Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

420
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:50,985
Yes, I know that.

421
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:55,251
You wrote me a letter,
you idiot.

422
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:57,690
Well, well.
Captain Forrest Gump.

423
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,627
I had to see this for myself...

424
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:03,398
and...

425
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:07,903
I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain,

426
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,904
that I'd be your first mate.

427
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:11,633
Well, here I am.

428
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:13,641
I'm a man of my word.

429
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:14,733
O.K.

430
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,971
But don't you be thinking

431
00:25:17,046 --> 00:25:19,480
that I'm going
to be calling you "sir."

432
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:20,480
No, sir.

433
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:30,548
It's my boat.

434
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:37,825
I have a feeling
if we head due east,

435
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,461
we'll find some shrimp,
so take a left.

436
00:25:42,872 --> 00:25:44,305
Take a left!

437
00:25:44,373 --> 00:25:45,305
Which way?

438
00:25:45,374 --> 00:25:46,306
Over there!

439
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,808
They're over there!

440
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:51,210
Get on the wheel
and take a left.

441
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,713
O.K.

442
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:55,983
Gump, what are you doing?

443
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:57,484
Take a left!

444
00:25:57,553 --> 00:25:58,542
Left!

445
00:26:00,422 --> 00:26:04,358
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

446
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:05,358
Ha ha!

447
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:07,554
That's where we'll find them.

448
00:26:19,975 --> 00:26:21,909
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

449
00:26:21,977 --> 00:26:23,911
O.K., so I was wrong.

450
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:26,914
Well, how are we
going to find them?

451
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:31,009
Maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

452
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:33,748
~ So pray that ~

453
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:37,088
~ I'm homeward bound... ~

454
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,855
<i>So I went to church every Sunday.</i>

455
00:26:41,297 --> 00:26:43,231
<i>Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,</i>

456
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:47,167
<i>though I think he left
the praying up to me.</i>

457
00:27:01,684 --> 00:27:03,083
No shrimp.

458
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:07,121
Where the hell's
this God of yours?

459
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:09,623
<i>It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that</i>

460
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:13,562
<i>'cause right then God showed up.</i>

461
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,644
[Dan]
You'll never sink this boat!

462
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:34,375
<i>Now, me, I was scared,</i>

463
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:38,510
<i>but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.</i>

464
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:39,576
Come on!

465
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:44,421
You call this a storm?

466
00:27:44,492 --> 00:27:48,428
Come on, you son of a bitch!

467
00:27:48,496 --> 00:27:52,432
It's time for a showdown!

468
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,967
You and me!

469
00:27:54,035 --> 00:27:57,095
I'm right here!
Come and get me!

470
00:27:57,172 --> 00:27:59,697
Ha ha! Ha ha!

471
00:27:59,774 --> 00:28:01,207
You'll never sink...

472
00:28:01,276 --> 00:28:02,573
this...

473
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:03,736
boat!

474
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:05,746
Ha ha ha ha!

475
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:07,949
<i>Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,</i>

476
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:09,879
destroying nearly
everything in its path.

477
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:12,886
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

478
00:28:12,954 --> 00:28:15,752
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

479
00:28:15,823 --> 00:28:18,155
<i>has fallen victim to Carmen</i>

480
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:21,058
<i>and has been left in utter ruin.</i>

481
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:22,561
<i>This reporter has learned,</i>

482
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,064
<i>in fact, only one shrimping boat</i>

483
00:28:25,132 --> 00:28:26,656
<i>actually survived the storm.</i>

484
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:29,202
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

485
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,364
<i>[Gump]
After that, shrimping was easy.</i>

486
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,204
~ There will be great bounty ~

487
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:37,938
~ Oh, my God... ~

488
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:39,946
<i>Since people still
needed them shrimps</i>

489
00:28:40,014 --> 00:28:42,380
<i>for shrimp cocktails
and barbecues and all</i>

490
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,385
and we were the only boat
left standing,

491
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:47,887
Bubba Gump shrimp's
what they got.

492
00:28:47,955 --> 00:28:50,890
We got a whole bunch of boats.

493
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,892
<i>12 Jennys, big old warehouse.</i>

494
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,894
We even have hats

495
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:57,396
that say "Bubba Gump" on them.

496
00:28:57,465 --> 00:28:58,898
Bubba Gump Shrimp.

497
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:00,399
It's a household name.

498
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:02,129
Hold on there, boy.

499
00:29:02,203 --> 00:29:04,637
Are you telling me
you're the owner

500
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:06,935
of the Bubba Gump
Shrimp Corporation?

501
00:29:07,008 --> 00:29:09,943
Yes. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

502
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:12,946
Boy, I heard some whoppers
in my time,

503
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:15,949
but that tops them all.

504
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:17,985
Ha ha ha ha!

505
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:21,453
We were sitting
next to a millionaire.

506
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:29,452
Well, I thought it was
a very lovely story,

507
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,590
and you tell it so well,

508
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,759
with such enthusiasm.

509
00:29:34,835 --> 00:29:38,931
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

510
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:41,236
Yes, I would.

511
00:29:45,513 --> 00:29:47,140
That's him right there.

512
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:52,443
Let me tell you
something about Lieutenant Dan.

513
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,010
Forrest...

514
00:29:59,193 --> 00:30:03,323
I never thanked you
for saving my life.

515
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:30,956
<i>He never actually said so,</i>

516
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:35,394
<i>but I think
he made his peace with God.</i>

517
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:42,093
<i>[Gunshots]</i>

518
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:44,967
<i>For the second time in 17 days,</i>

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,473
<i>President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.</i>

<i>Base to Jenny 1.

00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:51,977
<i>Jenny 1. Go, Margo.</i>

522
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:53,980
<i>Forrest has a phone call.</i>

523
00:30:54,048 --> 00:30:58,485
Yeah, well, you'll have
to tell them to call him back.

524
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,986
He is indisposed at the moment.

525
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:02,522
<i>His mama's sick.</i>

526
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:22,541
Where's Mama?

527
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,407
She's upstairs.

528
00:31:26,847 --> 00:31:28,576
Hi, Forrest.

529
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,844
I'll see you tomorrow.

530
00:31:30,918 --> 00:31:32,215
Oh, all right.

531
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:41,425
Sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

532
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,097
What's the matter, Mama?

533
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:58,339
I'm dying, Forrest.

534
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:03,382
Come on in,
sit down over here.

535
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:19,224
Why are you dying, Mama?

536
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,393
It's my time.

537
00:32:21,468 --> 00:32:24,528
It's just my time.

538
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:26,630
Oh, now...

539
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:30,268
don't you be afraid,
sweetheart.

540
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:33,745
Death is just a part of life.

541
00:32:33,814 --> 00:32:37,773
Something we're all
destined to do.

542
00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:40,183
I didn't know it,

543
00:32:40,254 --> 00:32:43,189
but I was destined
to be your mama.

544
00:32:43,257 --> 00:32:45,987
I did the best I could.

545
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,994
You did good.

546
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:54,331
Well... I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

547
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:58,929
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

548
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:05,037
What's my destiny, Mama?

549
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:09,549
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

550
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:13,819
Life is a box
of chocolates, Forrest.

551
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:16,822
You never know what
you're going to get.

552
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,825
<i>Mama always had a way
of explaining things</i>

553
00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:21,827
<i>so I could understand them.</i>

554
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:23,362
I will miss you, Forrest.

555
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:27,363
<i>She had got the cancer</i>

556
00:33:27,434 --> 00:33:29,368
<i>and died on a Tuesday.</i>

557
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:32,030
<i>I bought her a new hat</i>

558
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:34,131
<i>with little flowers on it.</i>

559
00:33:37,077 --> 00:33:39,773
And that's all I have
to say about that.

560
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:49,750
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number 7 bus?

561
00:33:49,823 --> 00:33:52,553
There'll be another one
along shortly.

562
00:33:56,063 --> 00:34:00,500
Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero

563
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:03,502
and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain

564
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,003
and a college graduate,

565
00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:07,506
the city fathers
of Greenbow, Alabama,

566
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:10,065
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

567
00:34:11,578 --> 00:34:15,105
<i>So I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,</i>

568
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:18,117
<i>though he did take care
of my Bubba Gump money.</i>

569
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:21,120
<i>He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.</i>

570
00:34:21,188 --> 00:34:23,622
<i>So then I got a call from him</i>

571
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:26,251
<i>saying we don't have to worry
about money no more,</i>

572
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:30,730
and I said,
"That's good. One less thing."

573
00:34:30,798 --> 00:34:32,595
~ I've got a new hope... ~

574
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:35,100
<i>Now Mama said
there's only so much fortune</i>

575
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:36,796
<i>a man really needs,</i>

576
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,271
<i>and the rest
is just for showing off.</i>

577
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:43,242
<i>So I gave a whole bunch of it</i>

578
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,575
<i>to the Foursquare Gospel Church...</i>

579
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:51,710
<i>and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...</i>

580
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:55,621
<i>and even though Bubba was dead</i>

581
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:59,125
<i>and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i>

582
00:34:59,193 --> 00:35:01,923
<i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i>

583
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:06,960
You know what?

584
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:10,970
<i>She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.</i>

585
00:35:11,038 --> 00:35:13,632
That smells wonderful.

586
00:35:13,707 --> 00:35:16,141
<i>And 'cause I was a gozillionaire</i>

587
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,145
<i>and I liked doing it so much,</i>

588
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:22,649
<i>I cut that grass for free.</i>

589
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:27,520
<i>But at nighttime
when there was nothing to do</i>

590
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:30,022
<i>and the house was all empty,</i>

591
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,025
<i>I'd always think of Jenny.</i>

592
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:40,390
<i>And then... she was there.</i>

593
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,456
Hello, Forrest.

594
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:16,722
Hello, Jenny.

595
00:37:27,574 --> 00:37:30,702
<i>Jenny came back
and stayed with me.</i>

596
00:37:30,777 --> 00:37:35,612
<i>Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,</i>

597
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:39,049
<i>or maybe it was because
she was so tired</i>

598
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,555
<i>'cause she went to bed
and slept and slept</i>

599
00:37:42,622 --> 00:37:44,852
<i>like she hadn't slept in years.</i>

600
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:47,290
<i>It was wonderful
having her home.</i>

601
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,794
<i>Every day we'd take a walk,</i>

602
00:37:49,863 --> 00:37:53,799
<i>and I'd jabber on
like a monkey in a tree,</i>

603
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:56,802
<i>and she'd listen about
Ping-Ponging and shrimping</i>

604
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,805
<i>and Mama making
a trip up to heaven.</i>

605
00:37:59,873 --> 00:38:01,807
<i>I did all the talking.</i>

606
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:04,366
<i>Jenny most of the time
was real quiet.</i>

607
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:46,747
How could you do this?

608
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:28,551
<i>Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.</i>

609
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:32,998
<i>I never really knew
why she came back,</i>

610
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,499
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

611
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:36,501
<i>It was like olden times.</i>

612
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:39,367
<i>We was like
peas and carrots again.</i>

613
00:39:41,007 --> 00:39:43,441
<i>Every day,
I'd pick pretty flowers</i>

614
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,071
<i>and put them in her room for her,</i>

615
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:50,583
<i>and she gave me the best gift
anyone could ever get</i>

616
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,083
<i>in the wide world.</i>

617
00:39:52,152 --> 00:39:54,677
They're made just for running.

618
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:56,016
<i>~ Carry me home to see my kin ~</i>

619
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:01,216
<i>And she even showed me
how to dance.</i>

620
00:40:03,062 --> 00:40:05,428
<i>~ I miss ol'Bammy once again ~</i>

621
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:06,726
<i>~ And I think it's a sin ~</i>

622
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:09,662
<i>~ Sweet home Alabama... ~</i>

623
00:40:09,736 --> 00:40:14,764
<i>Well, we was like family,
Jenny and me...</i>

624
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:20,874
<i>and it was the happiest time
in my life.</i>

625
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:46,504
You done watching it?

626
00:40:46,573 --> 00:40:47,505
Mm-hmm.

627
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:49,565
I'm going to bed.

628
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:02,044
Will you marry me?

629
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:10,061
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

630
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:14,498
You would, Forrest.

631
00:41:16,936 --> 00:41:18,699
But you won't marry me.

632
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:23,506
You don't want to marry me.

633
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:29,012
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

634
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,387
I'm not a smart man,

635
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:40,915
but I know what love is.

636
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,092
Jenny...

637
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:23,464
Forrest, I do love you.

638
00:43:16,488 --> 00:43:19,082
Where are you running off to?

639
00:43:19,158 --> 00:43:20,716
I'm not running.

640
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,118
<i>That day,</i>

641
00:44:53,185 --> 00:44:54,618
<i>for no particular reason,</i>

642
00:44:54,686 --> 00:44:57,678
<i>I decided to go for a little run.</i>

643
00:44:57,756 --> 00:45:01,214
<i>So I ran to the end of the road,</i>

644
00:45:01,293 --> 00:45:04,626
<i>and when I got there, I thought
maybe I'd run to the end of town.</i>

645
00:45:04,696 --> 00:45:07,324
<i>[TV] President Carter,
suffering from heat exhaustion...</i>

646
00:45:07,399 --> 00:45:09,390
<i>And when I got there,</i>

647
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:13,404
<i>I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.</i>

648
00:45:13,472 --> 00:45:15,906
<i>Now, I figured
since I'd run this far,</i>

649
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:19,842
<i>maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.</i>

650
00:45:19,912 --> 00:45:21,846
<i>And that's what I did.</i>

651
00:45:21,914 --> 00:45:23,905
<i>I ran clear across Alabama.</i>

652
00:45:23,982 --> 00:45:28,510
No particular reason.
I just kept on going.

653
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:30,521
I ran clear to the ocean.

654
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:37,353
<i>And when I got there,</i>

655
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:39,863
<i>I figured since
I'd gone this far,</i>

656
00:45:39,932 --> 00:45:43,095
<i>might as well turn around,
just keep on going.</i>

657
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:48,197
<i>And when I got to another ocean,</i>

658
00:45:48,273 --> 00:45:51,208
<i>I figured since
I'd gone this far...</i>

659
00:45:53,111 --> 00:45:55,409
<i>I might as well just turn back</i>

660
00:45:55,481 --> 00:45:57,073
<i>and keep right on going.</i>

661
00:45:57,149 --> 00:46:00,482
<i>When I got tired, I slept.</i>

662
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:02,645
<i>When I got hungry, I ate.</i>

663
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:05,155
When I had to go...

664
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:06,248
you know...

665
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:08,552
I went.

666
00:46:08,627 --> 00:46:09,821
And so...

667
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,920
you just ran.

668
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:15,123
Yeah.

669
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,897
~ Lookin' out at the road
rushin' under my wheels ~

670
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:24,941
~ Lookin' back
at the years gone by ~

671
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,308
~ Like so many summer fields ~

672
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:32,145
~ In '65, I was 17 ~

673
00:46:32,217 --> 00:46:34,651
~ And runnin' up one on one ~

674
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:38,682
~ I don't know
where I'm runnin' now ~

675
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:41,851
~ I'm just runnin' on ~

676
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:43,690
~ Runnin' on ~

677
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:45,696
~ Runnin' on empty ~

678
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:47,163
~ Runnin' on ~

679
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:49,029
~ Runnin' dry ~

680
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:50,033
~ Runnin' on... ~

681
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:51,694
<i>I'd think a lot...</i>

682
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:56,036
<i>about Mama and Bubba
and Lieutenant Dan.</i>

683
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:57,632
<i>But most of all,</i>

684
00:46:57,709 --> 00:46:59,700
<i>I thought about Jenny.</i>

685
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:02,542
<i>I thought about her a lot.</i>

686
00:47:04,016 --> 00:47:05,608
<i>For more than two years,</i>

687
00:47:05,684 --> 00:47:07,413
<i>a man named Forrest Gump,</i>

688
00:47:07,486 --> 00:47:10,478
<i>a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,</i>

689
00:47:10,556 --> 00:47:12,820
<i>has been running across America.</i>

690
00:47:12,891 --> 00:47:14,984
<i>Charles Cooper
brings you this report.</i>

691
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,322
<i>For the fourth time</i>

692
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:17,987
<i>on his journey across America,</i>

693
00:47:18,063 --> 00:47:20,497
<i>Forrest Gump, the gardener
from Greenbow, Alabama,</i>

694
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:23,330
<i>is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.</i>

695
00:47:23,402 --> 00:47:24,835
I'll be damned. Forrest?

696
00:47:24,903 --> 00:47:26,837
<i>Sir, where are you running?</i>

697
00:47:26,905 --> 00:47:29,339
Are you doing this
for world peace?

698
00:47:29,408 --> 00:47:31,842
Are you doing this
for the homeless?

699
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,844
Are you running
for women's rights?

700
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:34,844
The environment?

701
00:47:34,913 --> 00:47:36,175
<i>They just couldn't believe</i>

702
00:47:36,248 --> 00:47:38,682
<i>that somebody would do
all that running</i>

703
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,183
<i>for no particular reason.</i>

704
00:47:40,252 --> 00:47:41,844
Why are you doing this?

705
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,184
I just felt like running.

706
00:47:44,256 --> 00:47:45,883
I just felt like runnin'.

707
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:47,891
That's you.

708
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,554
I can't believe it's really you.

709
00:47:50,629 --> 00:47:52,062
Now... for some reason,

710
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,564

went off in my head.

more people joined in.</i>

00:58:59,928 --> 00:59:01,395
to be your wife?

894
00:59:03,198 --> 00:59:05,632
Do you, Jenny, take Forrest

895
00:59:05,701 --> 00:59:07,293
to be your husband?

896
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:12,328
And so I pronounce you
man and wife.

897
00:59:43,071 --> 00:59:44,197
Hi.

898
00:59:44,272 --> 00:59:45,364
Hi.

899
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,819
Hey, Forrest...

900
01:00:05,193 --> 01:00:07,684
were you scared in Vietnam?

901
01:00:09,031 --> 01:00:10,794
Yes.

902
01:00:10,866 --> 01:00:12,458
Well, l...

903
01:00:12,534 --> 01:00:14,661
I don't know.

904
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,795
<i>Sometimes it would stop raining</i>

905
01:00:16,872 --> 01:00:20,273
<i>long enough for
the stars to come out...</i>

906
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:25,145
<i>and then it was nice.</i>

907
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:31,477
It was like just
before the sun goes to bed

908
01:00:31,553 --> 01:00:32,952
down on the bayou.

909
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:37,754
<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water...</i>

910
01:00:39,561 --> 01:00:41,688
<i>like that mountain lake.</i>

911
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,697
<i>It was so clear, Jenny,</i>

912
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,700
<i>it looked like
there were two skies</i>

913
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,702
<i>one on top of the other.</i>

914
01:00:50,405 --> 01:00:53,772
And then in the desert,
when the sun comes up...

915
01:00:56,244 --> 01:00:57,677
<i>I couldn't tell</i>

916
01:00:57,746 --> 01:01:03,548
<i>where heaven stopped
and the earth began.</i>

917
01:01:04,853 --> 01:01:07,014
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

918
01:01:11,093 --> 01:01:14,119
I wish I could've
been there with you.

919
01:01:17,365 --> 01:01:19,356
You were.

920
01:01:29,611 --> 01:01:31,306
I love you.

921
01:01:35,383 --> 01:01:38,511
<i>[Gump]
You died on a Saturday morning.</i>

922
01:01:40,388 --> 01:01:44,484
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

923
01:01:48,897 --> 01:01:52,333
And I had that house
of your father's

924
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,664
bulldozed to the ground.

925
01:01:57,906 --> 01:01:59,100
<i>Mama...</i>

926
01:02:00,242 --> 01:02:02,176
always said

927
01:02:02,244 --> 01:02:06,340
that dyin' was a part of life.

928
01:02:08,917 --> 01:02:10,680
I sure wish it wasn't.

929
01:02:14,089 --> 01:02:15,613
Little Forrest is...

930
01:02:16,925 --> 01:02:19,189
doing just fine.

931
01:02:19,261 --> 01:02:20,250
"But..."

932
01:02:20,328 --> 01:02:22,762
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

933
01:02:22,831 --> 01:02:24,856
<i>and...</i>

934
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:28,198
<i>and I make his breakfast,
lunch, and dinner</i>

935
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:29,328
every day.

936
01:02:31,106 --> 01:02:32,698
I make sure he...

937
01:02:34,109 --> 01:02:35,542
combs his hair

938
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:37,703
and brushes his teeth every day.

939
01:02:39,948 --> 01:02:42,508
Teaching him how
to play Ping-Pong.

940
01:02:44,786 --> 01:02:46,219
<i>He's really good.</i>

941
01:02:46,288 --> 01:02:48,381
Uh, Forrest, you go.

942
01:02:48,456 --> 01:02:49,514
Uhh!

943
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:54,394
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

944
01:02:57,799 --> 01:03:00,165
And every night,
we read a book.

945
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:01,668
He's so smart, Jenny.

946
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,832
You'd be so proud of him.

947
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:09,839
I am.

948
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,409
He, uh, wrote you
a... a letter.

949
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,685
And he says I can't read it.
I'm not supposed to,

950
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,688
so I'll just leave it
here for you.

951
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,874
Jenny...

952
01:03:44,778 --> 01:03:47,713
I don't know
if Mama was right

953
01:03:47,781 --> 01:03:50,875
or if it... it's
Lieutenant Dan.

954
01:03:50,951 --> 01:03:52,816
I don't know...

955
01:03:53,954 --> 01:03:56,616
if we each have a...

956
01:03:57,791 --> 01:03:58,917
destiny...

957
01:04:00,394 --> 01:04:04,160
or if we're all just
floating around accidental-like

958
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:05,664
on a breeze...

959
01:04:09,904 --> 01:04:11,838
but l... I think...

960
01:04:13,741 --> 01:04:15,504
maybe it's both.

961
01:04:19,747 --> 01:04:22,978
Maybe both get happening
at the same time.

962
01:04:28,756 --> 01:04:30,690
But I miss you, Jenny.

963
01:04:37,264 --> 01:04:39,255
If there's anything
you need...

964
01:04:40,434 --> 01:04:42,368
I won't be far away.

965
01:05:05,893 --> 01:05:07,827
[Birds Chirping]

966
01:05:16,737 --> 01:05:19,171
Here's your bus.

967
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:20,604
O.K.

968
01:05:20,674 --> 01:05:23,165
Hey...

969
01:05:23,243 --> 01:05:24,676
I know this.

970
01:05:24,745 --> 01:05:27,179
I'm gonna share that
for show-and-tell

971
01:05:27,247 --> 01:05:30,410
because Grandma used
to read it to you.

972
01:05:30,484 --> 01:05:32,543
My favorite book.

973
01:05:36,023 --> 01:05:37,456
Here we are.

974
01:05:37,524 --> 01:05:38,855
Hey...

975
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:42,194
here you go.

976
01:05:47,368 --> 01:05:48,926
Hey, Forrest...

977
01:05:49,003 --> 01:05:50,470
don't...

978
01:05:53,273 --> 01:05:55,798
I want to tell you
I love you.

979
01:05:55,876 --> 01:05:57,844
I love you, too, Daddy.

980
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:00,778
I'll be right here
when you get back.

981
01:06:00,848 --> 01:06:01,815
[Pop]

982
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:09,656
You understand this is the bus
to school, now, don't you?

983
01:06:09,723 --> 01:06:13,489
Of course, and you're Dorothy
Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
