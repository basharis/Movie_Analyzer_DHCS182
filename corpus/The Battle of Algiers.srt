THE CITY OF VENICE 1966

4
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,980
Couldn't you have talked sooner?

5
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,649
It would've gone easier for you.

6
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,329
He finally came clean.

7
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,124
Give him some coffee.

8
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,003
Don't worry.

9
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:29,756
Drink this.
You'll feel better.

10
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,763
Don't take it so hard, fella.

11
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,525
At ease.

12
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,695
Is it true?
- Looks like it. 3 rue des Abderames.

13
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,155
Get him dressed.

14
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,784
Buck up.

15
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,204
It's all over now.
Just one last little effort.

16
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,581
Can you stand?

17
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,166
Let go of him.

18
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,170
Here, put this on.

19
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,385
It'll suit you fine.

20
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:22,141
We're going to the Casbah now.
They won't recognize you in that.

21
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,560
Show us Ali La Pointe's hideout.

22
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,687
Then you'll be free.

23
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,232
Give him a cap and dress him.

24
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,067
You're inducted!

25
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,860
Cut the clowning, Lagloy!

26
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,078
Let's go.

27
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,798
Knock it off!
Wanna go through another round?

28
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,343
Quit fooling around.
Pull yourself together.

29
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:08,271
THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS

30
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,975
Maybe they don't know we're here.

31
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:04,155
Ali La Pointe, the house
is surrounded. It's useless.

32
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,660
Give yourselves up.
Let the boy and the woman out first.

33
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,289
Then the other man with you.
After that, you come out.

34
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,292
Leave your weapons behind.

35
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,712
No tricks. You're done for.

36
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,800
We have you covered.
You don't have a chance. Got that?

37
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,471
You hear me, Ali?

38
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:34,935
Listen good! You're the last one.
It's all over.

39
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,937
The organization's finished.

40
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,815
Everyone's dead or in prison.

41
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,152
If you come out now,
you'll get a fair trial.

42
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,488
Make up your mind!

THE EUROPEAN QUARTER

00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,309
THE CASBAH

45
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,899
National Liberation Front (FLN),
Communiqué No. 1:

46
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:26,028
People of Algeria, our combat
is directed against colonialism.

47
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:30,324
Our aim: Independence and
restoration of the Algerian state,

48
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:34,578
in accordance with Islamic principles
and the respect of basic liberties,

49
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,498
regardless of race or religion.

50
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,710
To avoid bloodshed, we propose
that the French authorities

51
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:46,257
negotiate with us
our right to self-determination.

52
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:51,220
Algerians, it is your duty to save
your country and restore its liberty.

53
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,347
Its victory will be yours.

54
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:58,269
Forward, brothers! Unite!
The FLN calls you to arms.

55
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,522
Ladies and gents, place your bets.

56
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,941
This loses, this loses...

57
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,069
Ace wins.

58
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,906
500 francs.

59
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,619
Your turn, madam.

60
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,128
Ace wins, this one loses.

61
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,047
He's always there!

62
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,187
- What's his big hurry?
- Stop him.

63
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,660
Bash the bastard's head in!

64
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,091
Omar, Ali.

65
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,887
Alias Ali La Pointe.
Born January 15, 1930, in Miliana.

66
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,139
Illiterate.

67
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:22,311
Occupation: Laborer, bricklayer, boxer.
Currently unemployed.

68
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,772

00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,359
1942, Algiers Juvenile Court,

1944, Oran Juvenile Court,

72
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,536

1949, Court of Algiers,
eight-month prison term

74
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,171
for insulting
a police officer on duty.

75
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,989
Allah is great!

76
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:09,293
Long live Algeria!

77
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,230
Shut up! There he is.

78
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,733
Keep quiet.

79
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,835
FIVE MONTHS LATER

80
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,047
Beat it!

81
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,259
"Men have two faces.
One smiles, the other cries."

82
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,594
They sent you?

83
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,887
Yes, they sent me.

84
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,263
Here.

85
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,224
Wait!

86
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,143
Come back here.

87
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,563
Know how to read?
- Sure.

88
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,565
Read it to me.

89
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,490
"There's a Moorish café
on rue Randon, in the Casbah.

90
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:49,161
Merabi, the owner,
is a police informer.

91
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:53,999
Every afternoon at 5:00,
a French policeman stops by.

92
00:13:54,459 --> 00:14:00,756
He stays a few minutes, long enough
to drink a coffee and get information.

93
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,510
Then he leaves.
You are to kill the policeman."

94
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,721
- Not Merabi?
- No, the policeman.

95
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,223
Okay.

96
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,017
"You can't go wrong.

97
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:18,106
Right next to the café
you'll see a girl with a basket.

98
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,943
You'll both follow the policeman.

99
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,447
At the right moment,
she'll hand you a revolver.

100
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,450
You just have to pull the trigger."

101
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,558
Let go of me!

102
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,142
Watch me, brothers!

103
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,146
So, you're afraid now!

104
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,234
Look how the organization
deals with traitors.

105
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,680
- You bitch! You set me up.
- Careful, the police!

106
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,938
- Now explain!
- If they don't catch us first.

107
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,608
Who sent you?
Take me to him.

108
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,401
- He's waiting.
- Where?

109
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,446
You'll see, if we don't get caught.

110
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,466
You go first.
I'll be right behind you.

111
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,557
What if you were a traitor?
We had to be sure.

112
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:20,437
- The gun was empty.
- Say you'd been a police spy,

113
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:25,567
the FLN contacts you in prison,
you pretend to be for the cause,

114
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,653
and the French let you escape.

115
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,237
Then they shoot me?

116
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,073
Blanks.

117
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,160
You escape, go to the address
the FLN gives you in prison,

118
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,204
and infiltrate us.

119
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,622
And who are you?

120
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,917
Jaffar. El-hadi Jaffar.

121
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,421
To join us you had to do a job.

122
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,925
If I'd told you to kill
the bar owner, an Algerian,

123
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:55,931
the cops would've let you kill him
even though he's a stoolie.

124
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,475
It wouldn't have proved your loyalty.

125
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,645
If I told you to kill the cop,

126
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,107
the French
would never have allowed it.

127
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:09,152
If you had been one of them,
you wouldn't have done it.

128
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,446
But I didn't kill him.

129
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:16,243
No, but you tried.
That's the important thing.

130
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,286
You didn't trust me!

131
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,831
Come on, don't get excited.

132
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,793
I said to shoot him in the back.

133
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,128
No way!

134
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,922
You still don't understand.

135
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,509
Explain it better.

136
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,636
Okay, I'll explain.

137
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,724
First, we need to get organized

138
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,059
and secure our hideouts.

139
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,020
Then we can take action.

140
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,148
The organization's getting stronger,

141
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:51,903
but there are still too many
drunks, whores, junkies,

142
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,116
people who talk too much,
people ready to sell us out.

143
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,077
We must win them over
or eliminate them.

144
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:03,457
We need to clean house first,
organize the country.

145
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:07,586
Only then can we take on
our real enemy. You understand, Ali?

146
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,505
APRIL 1956

147
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,674
National Liberation Front,

148
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,634
Communiqué No. 24:

149
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,971
People of Algeria,
the Colonial Administration

150
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:22,267
is responsible not only
for impoverishing our people

151
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:27,522
but also for corrupting and degrading
our brothers and sisters,

152
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,358
who have lost their sense of dignity.

153
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,987
The FLN is leading a campaign
to eradicate this scourge

154
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,449
and requests the population's help
and cooperation.

155
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,495
This is the first step
towards independence.

156
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:49,127
As of today, the FLN
assumes responsibility

157
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,963
for the physical and moral well-being
of the Algerian people

158
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,381
and has therefore decided

159
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:58,386
to ban the sale and use
of all drugs and alcoholic beverages

160
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,681
and to ban
prostitution and procuring.

161
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:06,812
Offenders will be punished. Repeat
offenders will be sentenced to death.

162
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,231
Wino! Wino!

163
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,455
Don't you know
drugs are forbidden?

164
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,500
- Why?
- Don't do it again.

165
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,377
Have you seen Hassan El-Blidi?

166
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,639
You seen Hassan El-Blidi?
Tell him I'm looking for him.

167
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,520
Seen Hassan?

168
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,530
If you see Hassan El-Blidi,
tell him I'm looking for him.

169
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,869
Ali, where've you been?

170
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:50,081
- Is Hassan here?
- He left very early. Need something?

171
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,251
If you see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

172
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,885
Ali! How're you doing?

173
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,180
Stay there. Don't move.

174
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,974
- Take it easy.
- I told you not to move.

175
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,518
What are you afraid of?

176
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,895
I fear only God.

177
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,564
What's all this about?

178
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,359
There's nothing between us.

179
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,362
We're friends.
Have you forgotten?

180
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,030
We were friends.

181
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,449
What's happened to you?

182
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,909
You're sentenced to death.

183
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:32,374
Now I understand.

184
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,834
You've sentenced me to death.

185
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,632
What are they paying you?

186
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,550
Only one thing can save you.

187
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,720
You've been warned twice.
This is your last warning.

188
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,140
What do you mean?

189
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,267
Work for the FLN.

190
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,228
Get lost!

191
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:01,486
Don't try it! Take a good look.
Things will change in the Casbah.

192
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,364
Take a good look.
We'll clean this place up.

193
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,366
Now beat it!

194
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,037
And watch yourselves.

195
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:16,584
JUNE 10, 1956

196
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,344
Stay outside and keep watch.

197
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:35,186
Everything all right?
- Fine.

198
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:50,493
Be seated.

199
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,168
We'll skip the formalities.
You know why.

200
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,965
The day will come when we will have
our weddings in the open.

201
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,093
Remember, we are at war
against colonialism.

202
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:12,474
A strong army has occupied
our country for 130 years.

203
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:18,855
This is why the FLN
has to make decisions

204
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:22,859
concerning the civil life
of the Algerian people.

205
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,822
With this marriage
we fulfill our duty,

206
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,949
a duty of resistance.

207
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:43,088
And now,
Mahmud and Fatiha,

208
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,006
come forward.

209
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,848
Sign here.

210
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:59,145
May God grant you good fortune.
Sign here.

211
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,947
On behalf of the FLN,
my sincerest congratulations.

212
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,949
Make yourselves comfortable.

213
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:57,328
JUNE 20, 1956 - 10:32 A.M.

214
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,285
Come here!

215
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:42,123
What is it? Calm down.

216
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,083
Come in here.

217
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,127
Hey, Antoine...

218
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,882
Take them in to see the captain.

219
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:08,376
Yes, sir, but they didn't get
a search warrant.

220
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,045
Rue d'lsly?

221
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:15,550
They followed them some distance
but then lost them.

222
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:21,180
Of course, sir,
but that's in your precinct.

223
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,809
It's not their job.

224
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,895
Rue Marengo?
We do have some suspects.

225
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:32,483
The DA first demands
an official request.

226
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,694
Yes, sir.

227
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,531
But I don't have enough men.

228
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,033
I understand.

229
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,702
But if you could...

230
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,204
The prefect can't.

231
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:48,249
But couldn't you?

232
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,917
Okay.

233
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,129
They can slaughter all of us!

234
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:56,758
Right.

235
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:05,058
3:00 p. M:
Attempted attack against a patrol.

236
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:09,270
Location: Rue Luciani.
Weapon: 7.65mm revolver.

237
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:13,107
4:00 p. M:
Attack on territorial guard,

238
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:18,237
intersection of rue Consulaire
and Avenue Général Laquière.

239
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,918
For Paris, the solution is to put
Algiers under tight police control,

240
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:35,755
guard police stations,
close off streets.

241
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,673
I don't agree.

242
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,430
So, Corbière, where were we?

243
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,309
"Intersection of rue Consulaire
and Avenue Général Laquière."

244
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,452
The governor general decrees:

245
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:12,166
Article 1: Purchase of medication
for the treatment of gunshot wounds

246
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,545
must be authorized
by the prefecture.

247
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,591
Article 2:
Health care institutions

248
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,178
must keep the police informed

249
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:29,267
of all wounded patients
admitted for treatment.

250
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,533
From the prefecture of Algiers:

251
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:50,580
In recent days, dozens of attacks
have taken place in the city.

252
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,834
The perpetrators are known
to come from the Muslim quarters.

253
00:29:55,711 --> 00:30:00,756
Each time, they quickly find refuge
in these areas.

254
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,219
Consequently, to restore order,

255
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:09,223
the prefect has decided
to seal off the Arab quarters.

256
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,519
Checkpoints will be set up
at all access points.

257
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,565
Civilians must show ID
and may be subject to searches.

258
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,276
In line!

259
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,745
- Going back to the barracks?
- No, I've got two more days.

260
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,587
Don't touch me!

261
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,049
Keep your hands off me!

262
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,593
Never touch their women.

263
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:52,767
JULY 20, 1956 - 11:20 A.M.

264
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,735
What are you up to?

265
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,946
I'm meeting friends at the beach.

266
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,008
- You still there?
- This is my route.

267
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,759
Come here.

268
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,310
Beat it.

269
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,713
You go that way!
You, this way!

270
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:24,251
Same old story!
It's the government's fault.

271
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,088
What do they care?

272
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:31,676
Murder all the bastards!
Then we'll have some peace!

273
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,968
There he is!

274
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,637
I'm sure it's him!

275
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,890
- Where?
- Down there.

276
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,017
Get him!

277
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,770
Murderer! Murderer!

278
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,233
He looks like a dirty fellagha!

279
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,778
Where are you headed?

280
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:54,198
- Filthy Arab!
- Don't let him get away!

281
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:57,660
He's getting away! Stop him!

282
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,620
I saw him!

283
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,331
Stop him!

284
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,626
He's getting away!

285
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,526
Culprit: Laknan Abdullah.

286
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:36,991
Laborer, married, three children.
Address: 8 rue de Thèbes.

287
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:43,289
How many today?
- Seven attacks, three dead.

288
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:49,378
One copy for the prefect,
the press, the archives and for you.

289
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,380
Thanks. Night, Corbière.

290
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,174
Good night, sir.

291
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,260
Say, Corbière...

292
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,263
where's rue de Thèbes?

293
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,516
In the upper Casbah, I think.

294
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,853
Good night, Mommy.

295
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,022
Good night, children.

296
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,609
Fatma, why aren't they in bed?

297
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,236
They're just on their way.

298
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,489
We must get going.

299
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,784
What's your hurry?
You and your card games!

300
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,454
Can't you play here?

301
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:28,209
- One more for the road?
- Sure, one more.

302
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,046
Sorry, we're already late.

303
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,550
Good night everyone.
Hurry up.

304
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:40,721
Good-bye, Lucien.
Don't keep Henri up too late.

305
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,401
Get in back.

306
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,128
- Is it far?
- We're almost there.

307
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,268
- Can we go through?
- Too late.

308
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,438
Curfew's already started.

309
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,274
Let us through. He's with me.

310
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,778
Very well, sir. Go on through.

311
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,145
- No. 8, right?
- Yes. Make it snappy.

312
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,654
Murderers! Murderers!

313
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,853
Ali! Stop!

314
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,793
Jaffar says you must stop.

315
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,796
Listen to me, Ali.
Don't go down there.

316
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,048
The army will slaughter us.

317
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,716
Listen to me.
- Get out of here!

318
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,553
Halt!

319
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:29,570
Stay calm!
The FLN will avenge you!

320
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,947
The FLN will avenge you!

321
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,515
Stand guard on the roof.
You, come in.

322
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:29,147
- Is this all right?
- Fine.

323
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,400
Fine.

324
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:36,530
No good? Listen.

325
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,116
I'll take my son. It'll work.

326
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:45,622
Okay, but use the rue du Divan
checkpoint. It's easier there.

327
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,666
Then meet up with the others.

328
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,091
Air France, rue Mauritania.

329
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,722
The café, rue Michelet.

330
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,393
The milk bar, rue d'lsly.

331
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,687
The bomb timers are short.

332
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,481
They'll be set outside the Casbah.

333
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,401
Taleb is waiting for you
at the fish market.

334
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:20,741
But then you must hurry.
You only have 30 minutes to place them.

335
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:29,082
Good luck.

336
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,544
God be with you.

337
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,437
Halt!

338
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:04,034
- Your papers.
- I forgot them.

339
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,912
- Over there. Move it!
- They're at home.

340
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,414
Let me go get them!

341
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,255
- Get back.
- I'm in a hurry.

342
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,174
I said wait!

343
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,886
Get back or no one goes through.

344
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:25,597
- Let me through.
- Wait there.

345
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,183
- It's not fair.
- I said wait.

346
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,853
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.

347
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:37,526
May I go through, sir?
- Go ahead.

348
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,199
Excuse me.

349
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,410
It's all right.

350
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,101
Hands up.

351
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,283
Go on, madam.

352
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,326
Go on.

353
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:42,549
I'll only be an hour.
He's a good boy.

354
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,179
Thank you.

355
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,479
Going to the beach, miss?

356
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,565
- How'd you know?
- Oh, I just guessed.

357
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,901
Care for some company?

358
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,403
Not today. I'm meeting friends.

359
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,988
What a shame!

360
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,616
Maybe another time?

361
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,950
Who knows?

362
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:18,937
Good luck.

363
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,393
A Coke, please.

364
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,314
Would you like to sit down?

365
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,090
One hundred francs.

366
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,177
Leaving, miss?

367
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:15,762
What a pity.

368
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:25,290
Attention, please.

369
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:31,171
Flight 432 to Paris
will be delayed for 20 minutes.

370
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:46,394
Care for another martini?

371
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,792
What's going on?

372
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,802
A propane tank must've exploded.

373
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,092
The paratroopers are here!

374
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:27,013
JANUARY 10, 1957

375
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:37,315
Jean Charrot, Inspector General

376
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,651
on special assignment,

377
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,779
presided over a special
meeting convened

378
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:47,450
to organize the fight
against rebel activity.

379
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:53,414
Major decisions were made concerning
the maintenance of law and order

380
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,793
and the protection of persons
and private property.

381
00:54:57,044 --> 00:55:02,090
General Carelle
of the 10th Airborne Division

382
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:06,302
will be in charge
of maintaining order in Algiers.

383
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,555
He will command
all civil and military forces

384
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:13,184
and exercise special powers
by official decree.

385
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:29,158
Mathieu, Philippe.
Born August 5, 1907, in Bordeaux.

386
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,577
Rank: Lieutenant colonel.

387
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:34,706
Campaigns: Italy and Normandy.

388
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:37,875
Member of an anti-Nazi
resistance movement.

389
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:43,381
Expeditions: Madagascar and Suez.
Wars: Indochina and Algeria.

390
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:48,845
So we now average
4.2 attacks a day.

391
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:53,307
We must distinguish between attacks
on individuals and bombings.

392
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,936
As usual, the problem involves:

393
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:01,691
First, the adversary,
and second, the means to destroy him.

394
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:04,986
There are 400,000 Arabs
in Algiers.

395
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,573
Are they all our enemies?
We know they're not.

396
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:14,328
But a small minority holds sway
by means of terror and violence.

397
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:20,293
We must deal with this minority
in order to isolate and destroy it.

398
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:26,591
It's a dangerous enemy that
works in the open and underground,

399
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:31,387
using tried-and-true revolutionary
methods as well as original tactics.

400
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:39,103
It's a faceless enemy, unrecognizable,

401
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,898
blending in with hundreds of others.

402
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:46,444
It is everywhere. In cafés,
in the alleys of the Casbah,

403
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:49,572
or in the very streets
of the European quarter.

404
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,452
This footage was taken by the police

405
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,914
with cameras hidden
around Casbah checkpoints.

406
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:03,419
The police thought it might come in
handy, and indeed it does,

407
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:06,839
to show the futility
of certain methods,

408
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,509
or at least their drawbacks.

409
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:17,975
I deliberately chose footage
taken shortly before

410
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:21,187
a number of recent
terrorist attacks.

411
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:25,691
Among all these Arab men
and women

412
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,194
are the perpetrators.

413
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,363
But who are they?

414
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,032
How can we recognize them?

415
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:40,456
ID checks are ludicrous.
If anyone's papers are in order,

416
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,208
it's the terrorist's.

417
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:49,257
Note the cameraman's hunch.
He's sure there's something in that box.

418
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,718
And his film provides us
with the details.

419
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:59,183
There might have been
a false bottom with a bomb inside.

420
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,144
We'll never know.

421
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,146
That's enough, Martin.

422
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,401
We have to start from scratch.

423
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:13,072
The only information we have
concerns the organization's structure.

424
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,074
Let's start from there.

425
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,285
It's a pyramid organization

426
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:20,913
made up of a series of sections.
These sections, in turn,

427
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,958
are made up of triangles.

428
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,419
At the apex
is the Executive Bureau.

429
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:30,590
The military head
of the Executive Bureau

430
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:35,094
finds a competent person
and names him section head: No. 1.

431
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:40,016
No. 1 finds two others:
Nos. 2 and 3.

432
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,435
This makes up the first triangle.

433
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:47,064
Now Nos. 2 and 3
each select two men:

434
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,108
Nos. 4,

435
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,360
5, 6 and 7.

436
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:56,490
The reason for these geometrics
is that each organization member

437
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,243
knows only three other members:

438
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,370
The one who chose him

439
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:03,915
and the two he himself chose.

440
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,542
Contact is made only in writing.

441
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:10,087
That's why we don't know
our adversaries.

442
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:15,092
Because, in point of fact,
they don't know each other.

443
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,804
To know them is to eliminate them.

444
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:23,809
Consequently, the purely military
aspect of the problem is secondary.

445
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:27,355
More important
is the policing aspect.

446
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:31,442
I know you dislike that word.

447
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:37,698
But it's the only one
that describes the work at hand.

448
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,910
We must investigate
to reconstruct

449
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,913
the pyramid and identify
the Executive Bureau.

450
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,415
The basis of our job
is intelligence.

451
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,961
The method: Interrogation.

452
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:55,716
Conducted in such a way as
to ensure we always get an answer.

453
00:59:56,468 --> 01:00:01,555
In our situation, humane
considerations can only lead to despair

454
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,432
and confusion.

455
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:09,689
I'm sure all units will understand
and act accordingly.

456
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,234
Unfortunately, success doesn't
depend only on us.

457
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,238
The city must be at our disposal.

458
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,156
We must comb it thoroughly

459
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,534
and question all inhabitants.

460
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:26,539
But that's where we run
into the maze of laws still in force,

461
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:30,835
as if Algiers were a holiday resort
and not a battlefield.

462
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:35,381
We've requested a free hand,
but it's hard to obtain.

463
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:39,552
So we need an occasion
that will justify our intervention

464
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,721
and make it possible.

465
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,182
We ourselves must create
this occasion.

466
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:51,439
Unless our adversary provides us
with one, as it seems to be doing now.

467
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,873
To all militants:

468
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:13,586
After two years of bitter struggle
in the cities and in the mountains,

469
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:17,048
the Algerian people
have won a great victory.

470
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,759
On Monday, January 28,

471
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:24,764
the United Nations will open debate
on the Algerian question.

472
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:31,103
Our entire organization will mobilize
to explain this event's importance.

473
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:36,442
Beginning Monday, the FLN is calling
a week-long general strike.

474
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:40,863
During this period,
all armed action will be suspended.

475
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:47,912
Le Monde! Week-long strike!

476
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,257
The money, please.

477
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,641
We did it!

478
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,400
People of Algeria,

479
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:23,989
colonial powers, failing to block
UN debate on the Algerian question,

480
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:29,328
will attempt to demonstrate that
the FLN represents only a minority.

481
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:32,081
World opinion is with us.

482
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,500
Let us show our unity.

483
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:38,379
Support the strike
proclaimed by the FLN.

484
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:47,304
During this entire week,
stay away from European quarters.

485
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:50,850
Do not leave the Casbah.
Avoid gathering in closed places,

486
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:54,186
as this will facilitate raids.

487
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:59,316
Give shelter to the poor
and homeless.

488
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,111
Stock up on food and water
for a week.

489
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:07,867
- They seem calm.
- But you can feel something's up.

490
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:14,540
Like rabbits in a cage.
Just as I hoped.

491
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,877
Think they'll obey
the order to strike?

492
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,462
I think so.

493
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:24,675
- Is it going the way you wanted?
- I hope so.

494
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,344
What are you calling the operation?

495
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,221
Well, General...

496
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:50,284
DRINK CHAMPAGNE

497
01:03:55,790 --> 01:04:00,920
- "Operation Champagne."
- Why not?

498
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:04,423
Operation Champagne it is.

499
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:18,145
The homeless, the unemployed,
the beggars.

500
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:23,442
We've arranged for them to stay
with families during the strike.

501
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:26,779
That way they'll be
safe from police raids.

502
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:30,157
But I don't think they should
have been brought here.

503
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:32,535
It's a mistake.
- Why?

504
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:37,122
You're here. We'd better
move you somewhere else.

505
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:41,168
- Don't you trust them?
- I do, but you never know.

506
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:44,964
All right. You're in charge.

507
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:50,094
If I were in charge,
you wouldn't be in Algiers now.

508
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:55,975
- Duty first?
- Caution is best.

509
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:05,234
Ali, take Ben M'Hidi
to the Maison des Arbres.

510
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,487
Isn't he staying here?

511
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:12,157
No. Go with him.
I'll wait for you to come back.

512
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:15,786
What do you think?

513
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:21,125
How's this for a hideout?
Looks like a wall.

514
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:23,377
Take a look inside.

515
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:25,796
Not now. It's late.

516
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,721
Si Ben M'Hidi,
I'll be in touch tomorrow.

517
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,056
Ali, go first.

518
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,525
Cut through the mosque.

519
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:03,542
The coast is clear.

520
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:13,010
We can't do anything for a week.

521
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,138
What do you think of the strike?

522
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,723
I think it'll succeed.

523
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:22,102
I think so, too.
It's been well organized.

524
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,855
What will the French do?

525
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:28,984
Obviously, they'll try everything
to break it.

526
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,529
They'll do more than that,

527
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:35,532
because we've given them
an opportunity.

528
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:38,535
You know what I mean?

529
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:43,457
Now they'll no longer
be groping in the dark.

530
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,543
Every striker

531
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,254
will be a recognizable enemy.

532
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:54,718
A certified criminal.
The French will take the offensive.

533
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:58,097
Understand what I mean?
- Yes.

534
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:02,893
Jaffar says you weren't
in favor of the strike.

535
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:06,605
- No, I wasn't.
- Why not?

536
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:10,275
Because we were ordered
not to use arms.

537
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:14,113
Acts of violence don't win wars.

538
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,990
Neither wars nor revolutions.

539
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,785
Terrorism is useful as a start.

540
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:23,414
But then, the people
themselves must act.

541
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:27,000
That's the rationale
behind this strike.

542
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:31,171
To mobilize all Algerians,

543
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:33,632
to assess our strength.

544
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:36,176
To prove it to the UN?

545
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:39,680
Yes, to prove it to the UN.

546
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:42,558
It may not do any good,

547
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:48,313
but at least the UN will be able
to gauge our strength.

548
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,315
You know, Ali,

549
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:53,485
it's hard enough to start
a revolution,

550
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:58,657
even harder to sustain it,

551
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,702
and hardest of all to win it.

552
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:06,498
But it's only afterwards,
once we've won,

553
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,376
that the real difficulties begin.

554
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:14,590
In short, there's still much to do.

555
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:17,468
You're not tired, Ali?

556
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:18,969
No.

557
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:17,736
Wake up!

558
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,405
Everybody out!

559
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:31,166
You bastards!
We'll teach you to strike!

560
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:24,386
Attention all vehicles!

561
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:29,308
Load the requisitioned workers!
Truck No. 1 to El Biar.

562
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:31,351
No. 2, the gasworks.

563
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:33,353
No. 3, the docks.

564
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:35,856
Attention!

565
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:40,402
Dispatch all suspects
to headquarters.

566
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,201
That one.

567
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,496
You, come here. Stop.

568
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,833
On strike, are you?
- I'm sick.

569
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:59,254
You're too scared to admit it.
Admit you're with the FLN.

570
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:02,007
You're one of them.

571
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:05,218
Take me for an idiot?
Think I can't tell?

572
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:10,098
The FLN wants you to strike
and you won't talk? You dirty Arab!

573
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:14,061
Suit yourself.
Gérard, take him away.

574
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,813
- Come with me.
- Are you deaf?

575
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,694
Everyone back to work!

576
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:25,447
Get a move on!

577
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:33,622
Day four:
The general strike continues.

578
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:38,543
All activity has come to a halt.
No serious incident has been reported.

579
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,630
All is quiet in the Muslim quarter.

580
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,133
I'll call you back.

581
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:48,720
Mathieu's here.

582
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:57,062
- Some questions...
- I'm meeting with the prefect.

583
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:01,692
- What's going on?
- I'm just assessing the situation.

584
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:07,030
Go and see for yourselves.
You're free to move around.

585
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:11,284
- The strike seems successful.
- It missed its main target.

586
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,078
Insurrection?

587
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,540
That isn't the aim.
- You believe the FLN?

588
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:20,419
It's plausible this time.
A strike might convince the UN.

589
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:24,631
The UN is far away.
How can it gauge a strike's magnitude?

590
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:27,759
Bombs would be more practical.
That would be my choice.

591
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:32,431
What would
armed insurrection mean now?

592
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:36,935
What it always means: An inevitable
phase in revolutionary warfare.

593
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:40,022
After terrorism
comes armed insurrection.

594
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,817
Just as guerrilla warfare leads
to warfare proper.

595
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:45,152
Dien Bien Phu?

596
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:48,864
Exactly.
But in Indochina they won.

597
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,283
- And here?
- That depends on you.

598
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:55,162
On us?
You intend to sign us up?

599
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:59,249
God forbid! Just do your reporting
and do it well.

600
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:02,085
It's not warriors we need.
- Then what?

601
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:05,630
Political will, which is sometimes
there and sometimes isn't.

602
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:09,634
Sometimes it's not enough.
What did Paris say yesterday?

603
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:12,554
Nothing. Another article by Sartre.

604
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:18,643
Why are the Sartres
always born on the other side?

605
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:20,645
Then you like Sartre?

606
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:24,649
No, but I like him
even less as a foe.

607
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:32,282
1, 2, 3, 4...
Come with me.

608
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,328
Move it.

609
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:53,220
- What's that?
- The dance hall.

610
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:07,317
Let's get it over with.
Repeat what you said and you can go.

611
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,027
Name?
- Smain.

612
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:10,904
- First name?
- Ahmed.

613
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:13,323
- Section?
- Second section.

614
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,868
- Be more precise.
- Second section.

615
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,537
Casbah, Algiers West.

616
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:20,539
- Which group?
- Third group.

617
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:25,502
- What was your role?
- Head of the sixth cell.

618
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:26,878
That'll do.

619
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,280
DAY SIX OF THE STRIKE

620
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:36,907
People of the Casbah,

621
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:40,785
the FLN wants to stop you
from working.

622
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:44,831
The FLN is forcing you
to close your shops.

623
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:50,003
The FLN wants to starve you
and condemn you to poverty.

624
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,964
The FLN wants to stop you
from working.

625
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,175
People of the Casbah,

626
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:59,054
France is your motherland.

627
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:05,685
Mohammed! Mohammed!
Have you seen him?

628
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:12,651
The FLN wants to starve you
and condemn you to poverty.

629
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:18,657
People of the Casbah,
resist the FLN's orders.

630
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:21,701
Thank God you're home.

631
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,997
God bless you, my children.

632
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,667
Have you seen my brother Said?

633
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:08,748
Algerians! Brothers! Take heart!

634
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,377
The FLN tells you not to be afraid!

635
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:17,340
Don't worry, we're winning.

636
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:21,386
The FLN is on your side.

637
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:25,348
Long live Algeria!

638
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:48,163
FEBRUARY 5, 1957

639
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,248
FINAL DAY OF THE STRIKE

640
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,936
Open the shop.

641
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:27,994
Go on!

642
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:29,788
Faster!

643
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,475
The UN General Assembly,

644
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:56,648
all motions having failed
to obtain a majority,

645
01:18:56,816 --> 01:19:02,153
has passed a resolution ruling out
any direct intervention in Algeria.

646
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:07,325
The UN, however, hopes that
in a spirit of cooperation,

647
01:19:07,535 --> 01:19:11,496
a peaceful, democratic
and fair solution will be found

648
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:14,999
in keeping with the principles
of the UN charter.

649
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,801
Good. Well done.

650
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,555
Now we can go turn in.

651
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:15,935
The end of the strike changes nothing.
Instructions remain the same.

652
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:18,396
Give your boys the usual orders.

653
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:22,484
We must occupy the Casbah
24 hours a day.

654
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:26,988
We must continue our work here,
without respite.

655
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:38,500
Any of you ever suffer from tapeworm?

656
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:41,586
It's a worm that can grow infinitely.

657
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:45,256
You can destroy
its thousands of segments

658
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:50,094
but as long as the head remains,
it rebuilds and proliferates.

659
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:52,555
The FLN is similarly organized.

660
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:56,059
The head is the Executive Bureau.
Several persons.

661
01:20:56,227 --> 01:21:00,396
As long as they're not eliminated,
we're back to zero.

662
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:02,357
Here are four of them.

663
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,532
I found these in the police records.

664
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,325
I had the snapshots blown up.

665
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,411
Si Murad.

666
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:17,121
Ramel.

667
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:19,374
Jaffar.

668
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:25,463
Ali La Pointe.

669
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:30,009
Print up a thousand copies
and distribute them to our men.

670
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:32,595
Who else lives here?

671
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:37,976
I told you. My daughter upstairs,
and my husband, who's at work.

672
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:41,271
Okay, Pierre. Let's go.

673
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:47,360
They're gone.

674
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:16,931
There were ten this time.

675
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,516
- Paratroopers?
- Yes.

676
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:21,352
Did a traitor bring them here?

677
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:22,854
They came alone.

678
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:26,149
They asked questions.
They didn't hurt anyone.

679
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:31,738
Jibela Malika has been arrested.

680
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:35,617
Sheik Abdullah has been arrested...

681
01:22:57,222 --> 01:23:02,477
People of the Casbah,
the FLN has lost the battle.

682
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:07,982
Stand up to its dying authority.

683
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:12,403
Work with us to build
a new Algeria.

684
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:16,866
Mujid Ben Ali has been arrested.

685
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:34,550
- What's wrong?
- They arrested him.

686
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,260
Take courage.

687
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:54,028
We'll split up.
We must change our hideouts.

688
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:58,324
We must reestablish our contacts.

689
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:01,744
We must replace
those arrested and killed

690
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:03,788
and reorganize our groups.

691
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:06,749
We have to make our presence felt.

692
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:08,626
That'll come later.

693
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:12,171
No. Right now.
Leave it to me.

694
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,967
No. None of us will do anything.

695
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:19,762
We have to resist
as much as we can,

696
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:23,641
without giving the enemy
a chance to catch us. Agreed?

697
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:26,686
We have to do something.

698
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,897
That's why we must reestablish
our contacts first.

699
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:34,152
- How do we move?
- I'll take care of that.

700
01:24:56,175 --> 01:24:58,301
I'll be out in three months.

701
01:24:58,469 --> 01:24:59,886
Hey, look!

702
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:09,497
Quick, hide us!
We're being followed.

703
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:12,708
Where? On the terrace?

704
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:16,879
Come in, brothers.
God protect you.

705
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:21,759
Hide in the well.
God be with you.

706
01:26:56,003 --> 01:27:01,048
They're gone. Wait until I call.
Then you can come up.

707
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:03,175
Thank you.

708
01:27:06,889 --> 01:27:10,349
The first section's dead.
There's no one left.

709
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:13,895
We lost contact with the second.

710
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:16,063
The third is reorganizing.

711
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:20,151
All that's left is the fourth.
It's enough to start over with.

712
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,195
FEBRUARY 25, 1957

713
01:27:56,688 --> 01:28:00,399
Bastard!
You'll pay for the others!

714
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:11,369
Keep calm! Get back!

715
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:45,361
MARCH 4, 1957

716
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,659
No more photographs.

717
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:54,203
Mr. Ben M'Hidi,

718
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:57,623
isn't it cowardly to use
your women's baskets

719
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:01,752
to carry bombs, which have
taken so many innocent lives?

720
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:07,883
Isn't it even more cowardly
to attack defenseless villages

721
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:11,345
with napalm bombs that kill
many thousands of times more?

722
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:15,099
Obviously, planes would
make things easier for us.

723
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:17,101
Give us your bombers, sir,

724
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:19,562
and you can have our baskets.

725
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:42,460
The FLN has more of a chance
of defeating the French army

726
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:45,046
than the French have
of changing the course of history.

727
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:49,008
According to a declaration
by Colonel Mathieu,

728
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:52,762
you were arrested by chance.
Practically by mistake.

729
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:55,556
The paratroopers

730
01:29:55,724 --> 01:30:00,478
were looking for someone
less important than you.

731
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:03,814
Can you tell us why you were
in that apartment

732
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:06,233
on rue Debussy?

733
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:09,528
All I can say is
I wish I'd never set foot there.

734
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:14,450
That'll be all.
It's late and we have work to do.

735
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:16,118
So the show's over?

736
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:18,245
Yes, it's over.

737
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:21,499
Before it has
the opposite effect.

738
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:41,435
People of the Casbah,
the rebellion is dying out.

739
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:47,942
Ali Mohammed, head of
FLN Section 2, was killed this morning.

740
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:52,613
People of Algiers,

741
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:55,533
turn in the agitators.

742
01:30:56,243 --> 01:30:59,120
Disassociate yourselves
from the rebel organization.

743
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:06,127
The army is protecting you.
Trust in it.

744
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:22,393
Colonel Mathieu,

745
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:26,605
the spokesman for
the Resident Minister, Mr. Gorlin,

746
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:29,024
states that Larbi Ben M'Hidi

747
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,193
hanged himself in his cell

748
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:37,616
using strips of his shirt
that he made into a rope

749
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:41,245
and tied to the bars of his window.

750
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:47,668
Given his stated intention
to escape at the first opportunity,

751
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,420
it was thought necessary

752
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:52,756
to keep the prisoner bound

753
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:56,677
hand and foot at all times.
In your opinion, Colonel,

754
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:59,722
in such a condition, can a man

755
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:05,186
tear his shirt up,
make a rope out of it,

756
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,938
and hang himself from a window?

757
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:11,317
Ask the spokesman about that.

758
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:13,444
I didn't make such a statement.

759
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:20,618
For my part, I had the chance
to appreciate the moral fiber,

760
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:25,539
courage and commitment
of Ben M'Hidi to his own ideals.

761
01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:29,877
And so, notwithstanding
the great danger he represented,

762
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:32,046
I pay tribute to his memory.

763
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:38,886
There's been a lot of talk, not only
of the paratroopers' success,

764
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:43,891
but also of the methods
they're said to use.

765
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,809
Can you comment on this?

766
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:49,897
Their success is the result
of these methods.

767
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:51,899
One depends on the other.

768
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:54,068
Excuse me, Colonel.

769
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:58,739
It seems to be that, perhaps
out of an excess of caution,

770
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:03,202
my colleagues keep asking you
indirect questions

771
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:07,164
to which you can only reply
in a roundabout way.

772
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:10,251
It would be better to call...

773
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:15,172
a spade a spade.
So let's talk about torture.

774
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:18,884
I understand.
And you? Have you no question?

775
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:23,639
They've all been asked.
I'd just like more precise answers.

776
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:29,853
Let's try to be precise.
The word "torture" isn't used in our orders.

777
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:33,691
We use interrogation
as the only valid police method

778
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:36,485
against clandestine activity.

779
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:40,197
The FLN asks all its members,

780
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:44,743
in case of capture,
to remain silent for 24 hours.

781
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:47,121
Then they may talk.

782
01:33:47,414 --> 01:33:52,835
This gives the FLN time
to render any information useless.

783
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:57,131
And us? What form of questioning
must we adopt?

784
01:33:57,299 --> 01:33:59,425
Civil law procedures,

785
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,760
which take months
for a mere misdemeanor?

786
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:03,971
Legality can be inconvenient.

787
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:08,058
Is it legal to set off bombs
in public places?

788
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:12,813
Remember Ben M'Hidi's answer
when you asked him the question.

789
01:34:14,024 --> 01:34:18,235
No, gentlemen, believe me.
It's a vicious circle.

790
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:23,991
We could talk for hours to no avail,
because that isn't the problem.

791
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:26,327
The problem is this:

792
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:30,331
The FLN wants to throw us out
of Algeria, and we want to stay.

793
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:33,459
Even with slight shades of opinion,

794
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:36,503
you all agree that we must stay.

795
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:40,591
When the FLN rebellion began,
there were no shades at all.

796
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:45,179
Every paper, the communist press
included, wanted it crushed.

797
01:34:45,347 --> 01:34:47,848
We're here for that reason alone.

798
01:34:48,058 --> 01:34:51,268
We're neither madmen nor sadists.

799
01:34:51,478 --> 01:34:54,063
Those who call us fascists

800
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:58,484
forget the role many of us
played in the Resistance.

801
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:00,194
Those who call us Nazis

802
01:35:00,403 --> 01:35:03,947
don't know that some of us survived
Dachau and Buchenwald.

803
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:08,035
We are soldiers.
Our duty is to win.

804
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:10,371
Therefore, to be precise,

805
01:35:11,164 --> 01:35:13,957
it's my turn to ask a question.

806
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:17,169
Should France stay in Algeria?

807
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:20,005
If your answer is still yes,

808
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:23,217
then you must accept
all the consequences.

809
01:37:13,495 --> 01:37:16,663
A doctor!
He's been stabbed!

810
01:37:34,224 --> 01:37:36,475
I'm out of ammo!

811
01:37:45,068 --> 01:37:46,860
Look there!

812
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:48,779
Run them down!

813
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:04,545
AUGUST 26, 1957

814
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:24,731
Make way for the colonel.

815
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:30,779
There's no point playing the hero.
Hand me the megaphone.

816
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:39,079
Ramel. Si Murad.

817
01:38:39,706 --> 01:38:40,914
Listen:

818
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:45,794
I wouldn't want to be
in your shoes when you're captured.

819
01:38:46,004 --> 01:38:47,921
You know we'll get you.

820
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:56,805
Surrender and you won't be harmed.
You'll get a fair trial.

821
01:38:57,932 --> 01:38:59,891
Do you hear?
- Who's speaking?

822
01:39:00,727 --> 01:39:03,061
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.

823
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:06,440
We don't trust you.

824
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:09,526
Come closer.

825
01:39:11,446 --> 01:39:12,863
Let us see you.

826
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:15,824
Why don't you trust me?

827
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:19,369
Stand up so that we can see you.

828
01:39:19,579 --> 01:39:22,456
Keep your hands still
and in sight.

829
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:29,046
But we want the promise
of a fair trial in writing.

830
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:37,721
Give us a written promise.
Then we'll surrender.

831
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:41,224
How do I get it to you?

832
01:39:41,643 --> 01:39:45,145
We'll lower our guns in a basket.

833
01:39:45,355 --> 01:39:47,522
Fair enough.
I'm make this statement in writing.

834
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:17,969
Finished?

835
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:20,305
Yes, finished.

836
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:31,233
- Ready, Mathieu?
- Yes, but let's see you first.

837
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:46,873
28, 27, 26,

838
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:51,586
25, 24, 23...

839
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:01,930
We can see them now.
Go ahead.

840
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:10,063
Here.

841
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:14,693
You know that when I give my word,
I keep it.

842
01:41:17,697 --> 01:41:20,240
The bastard! He got away!

843
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:34,087
Faster, dirty Arab!

844
01:41:34,172 --> 01:41:36,465
Take this, you dog!

845
01:41:43,181 --> 01:41:44,890
Burn all the papers.

846
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:47,017
SEPTEMBER 24, 1957

847
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:51,980
Don't leave a trace.

848
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:02,324
Which of you is Zakia?

849
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:04,618
You?

850
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:08,371
Go tell Jaffar to surrender

851
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:10,916
or we'll blow up the house
and everyone in it.

852
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:14,503
Try to convince him
if you want to keep your house.

853
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:16,213
Got that?

854
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:20,383
Wait. You'll get yourself killed.

855
01:42:20,635 --> 01:42:21,635
Jaffar!

856
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:26,848
Zakia's coming up.
I wouldn't shoot if I were you.

857
01:42:27,099 --> 01:42:28,809
Go on now.

858
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:46,576
Jaffar.

859
01:42:47,036 --> 01:42:48,495
Listen to me.

860
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:51,081
They say if you don't come down,

861
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:52,958
they'll blow up the house.

862
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,962
You can tell them to blow up
whatever they want.

863
01:42:57,797 --> 01:42:59,381
Go tell them!

864
01:43:06,764 --> 01:43:09,683
He says he won't surrender,
that you can blow it all up.

865
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:11,726
All right. Join the others.

866
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:15,564
Prepare the explosives.

867
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:18,608
Get as close as possible,
but don't take risks.

868
01:43:18,693 --> 01:43:20,443
Use a long fuse, then cut it.

869
01:43:20,653 --> 01:43:24,072
Give them cover while they work.

870
01:43:28,953 --> 01:43:33,874
You, keep your eyes open.
Anything can happen, as we know.

871
01:44:07,366 --> 01:44:11,828
It's really pointless
to die like this.

872
01:44:14,498 --> 01:44:19,920
Mathieu! If you give me your word
not to hurt anyone in this house,

873
01:44:20,087 --> 01:44:21,922
we'll come down.

874
01:44:30,598 --> 01:44:33,808
I'd have hated to blow you all up.

875
01:44:34,018 --> 01:44:35,226
Why?

876
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:38,939
Your picture and your file

877
01:44:39,148 --> 01:44:41,816
have been on my desk for months.

878
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:45,028
I have the feeling I know you a bit.

879
01:44:46,364 --> 01:44:49,699
You don't strike me as the kind
for empty gestures.

880
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:53,495
You seem satisfied
to have me alive.

881
01:44:55,081 --> 01:44:56,039
Yes, I am.

882
01:44:57,124 --> 01:45:01,252
I thought you'd regret it.
I gave you an unexpected advantage.

883
01:45:02,088 --> 01:45:05,507
No, only the satisfaction
of having had the right hunch.

884
01:45:07,176 --> 01:45:08,259
Technically speaking,

885
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:12,138
we can't talk about advantages.
The game's over.

886
01:45:12,807 --> 01:45:16,977
Monster! Hypocrite! You're wrong.
Ali La Pointe is still in the Casbah.

887
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:18,311
What's she saying?

888
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:22,065
She says Ali La Pointe is still free.

889
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,008
- Come in.
- I'm coming.

890
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:51,761
You're tired. Go rest.

891
01:45:57,268 --> 01:45:58,768
Omar, go to bed.

892
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:00,979
We have a job tomorrow.

893
01:46:01,147 --> 01:46:05,442
Myself, Mahmud, Hassiba...

894
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:11,031
and you.

895
01:46:12,575 --> 01:46:17,704
There's no one else left.
Sadek will drive.

896
01:46:17,913 --> 01:46:22,375
You get out, plant the bomb,
and come back fast.

897
01:46:23,044 --> 01:46:26,880
Be sure they don't follow you.
Then we'll get out.

898
01:46:27,048 --> 01:46:31,051
Hassiba first, then Mahmud.
I'll see to the rest.

899
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:18,515
Wake up.

900
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:26,606
Sleep well?
Get ready to go.

901
01:47:32,196 --> 01:47:35,490
- Is it time?
- Almost.

902
01:47:35,991 --> 01:47:37,659
Hassiba!
- I'm ready.

903
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,078
I heard a truck.

904
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:44,165
So did I. But if it was Sadek,
he'd be here by now.

905
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:53,466
- How's your wife?
- She's fine.

906
01:47:55,136 --> 01:47:56,803
Inside!

907
01:48:52,693 --> 01:48:53,902
Outside!

908
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:55,778
On your feet!

909
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:50,083
Well?

910
01:49:50,292 --> 01:49:52,669
All ready.
I had the house evacuated.

911
01:49:52,836 --> 01:49:55,630
- Has he answered?
- Absolute silence.

912
01:49:55,839 --> 01:49:57,632
I thought as much.

913
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:02,762
Ali La Pointe!

914
01:50:03,931 --> 01:50:07,934
At least let the others out,
or you'll all be blown up.

915
01:50:08,727 --> 01:50:11,396
The boy will just go
to the reformatory for a while.

916
01:50:12,273 --> 01:50:14,148
Why let him die?

917
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:29,289
He's still here?
Take him away.

918
01:50:40,968 --> 01:50:42,844
Ali... Ali La Pointe!

919
01:50:43,012 --> 01:50:46,472
You have another 30 seconds.
What are you hoping for?

920
01:50:46,724 --> 01:50:49,142
Anyway, you've lost.

921
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:52,520
Think hard. Thirty seconds.

922
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:54,814
Thirty seconds from now.

923
01:50:59,153 --> 01:51:01,237
Whoever wants to can go.

924
01:51:02,156 --> 01:51:05,992
- What'll you do?
- I don't trust them.

925
01:51:11,999 --> 01:51:15,168
You four stay here.
Come down when I give the signal.

926
01:52:06,929 --> 01:52:09,055
- Everything ready?
- All ready, sir.

927
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:36,457
Stand back.

928
01:53:11,452 --> 01:53:14,495
You two cover him and be careful.
You never know.

929
01:53:22,546 --> 01:53:24,797
The tapeworm's headless now.

930
01:53:24,965 --> 01:53:27,300
Satisfied, Mathieu?
- Yes, sir.

931
01:53:27,468 --> 01:53:31,053
- The FLN is decapitated in Algiers.
- We'll hear no more of it.

932
01:53:32,306 --> 01:53:35,975
At least for the time being.
- Forever, let's hope.

933
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:40,146
They're basically decent people.
We got on fine for 130 years.

934
01:53:40,314 --> 01:53:44,817
Why shouldn't it continue?
- But Algiers isn't all of Algeria.

935
01:53:45,027 --> 01:53:47,820
No, Algiers isn't all Algeria.

936
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:52,575
True, but for now
let's settle for Algiers.

937
01:53:52,784 --> 01:53:55,578
Things are much easier
in the mountains.

938
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,170
Good-bye, sir.

939
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:08,508
Good-bye, Mathieu.
I'll see you this afternoon.

940
01:54:08,717 --> 01:54:10,176
Yes, sir.

941
01:54:14,723 --> 01:54:18,309
DECEMBER 11, 1960

942
01:54:28,028 --> 01:54:33,115
For some unknown reason,
due to some obscure motive,

943
01:54:33,617 --> 01:54:36,536
after two years of relative quiet,

944
01:54:36,787 --> 01:54:39,080
with the war contained mostly

945
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:43,626
in the mountains, disturbances
broke out again without warning,

946
01:54:43,835 --> 01:54:47,213
and nobody knows why or how.

947
01:54:47,464 --> 01:54:50,383
I phoned Tunis.

948
01:54:50,551 --> 01:54:55,680
I spoke to an exiled FLN chief,
but he knows nothing either.

949
01:54:57,641 --> 01:55:01,060
Long live Algeria!

950
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:16,450
This morning, for the first time,
out came flags with crescent and star.

951
01:55:17,244 --> 01:55:18,744
Thousands of flags,

952
01:55:18,829 --> 01:55:20,913
probably made overnight.

953
01:55:21,915 --> 01:55:26,294
"Flags" is hardly the word.
More like torn sheets, shirts, rags -

954
01:55:26,545 --> 01:55:28,421
but flags nevertheless.

955
01:55:38,307 --> 01:55:40,600
We're marching for freedom!

956
01:56:08,629 --> 01:56:10,379
The situation is more tense today.

957
01:56:11,423 --> 01:56:12,590
Despite pressure

958
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:17,303
from the most rigid colonialists,
the government had given orders

959
01:56:17,429 --> 01:56:19,930
not to open fire
except as a last resort.

960
01:56:21,183 --> 01:56:26,479
Attempts were made this afternoon
to descend into the European quarter.

961
01:56:27,064 --> 01:56:31,984
There were several casualties,
but things seem to have calmed down.

962
01:56:32,861 --> 01:56:34,779
The Muslim quarters still echo

963
01:56:34,946 --> 01:56:38,199
with those unintelligible
and frightening rhythmic cries.

964
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:30,603
The surprising unity
of these demonstrations

965
01:58:30,937 --> 01:58:34,482
has made a deep impression
on French public opinion.

966
01:58:34,733 --> 01:58:38,944
According to Paris, a significant
segment of the political class

967
01:58:39,154 --> 01:58:43,073
is in favor of seeking
a new relationship with Algeria.

968
01:58:50,457 --> 01:58:52,166
DECEMBER 21, 1960

969
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:54,251
LAST DAY OF DEMONSTRATIONS

970
01:58:54,878 --> 01:58:56,587
Listen to me!

971
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:00,591
Return to your homes!

972
01:59:03,386 --> 01:59:05,638
What do you want?

973
01:59:10,894 --> 01:59:12,645
Independence!

974
01:59:12,854 --> 01:59:14,980
Our pride!

975
01:59:17,275 --> 01:59:19,026
We want our freedom!

976
02:00:27,053 --> 02:00:30,264
Two more years of struggle
still lay ahead.

977
02:00:30,473 --> 02:00:34,476
Then, on July 2, 1962,
with its independence,

978
02:00:34,644 --> 02:00:37,104
the Algerian nation was born.

979
