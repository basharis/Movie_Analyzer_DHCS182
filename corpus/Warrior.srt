1
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:09,318
Hey, Jenny.
That was a wonderful share, tonight.

2
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,542
"Chapter 36, The Quarter-Deck.

3
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,295
"Enter Ahab. Then, all.

4
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,798
"It was not a great while
after the affair of the pipe,

5
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:34,552
"that one morning, shortly after breakfast,
Ahab, as was his wont,

6
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,346
"ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.

7
00:01:55,449 --> 00:02:00,119
"'It's a white whale, I say, ' resumed
Ahab, as he threw down the top-maul.

8
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:04,207
"'A white whale.
Skin your eyes for him, men,

9
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,835
"'look sharp for white water,
if ye see but a bubble, sing out."'

10
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,613
Tommy?

11
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,991
Jesus!

12
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,375
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,794
Well, I was just passing through

14
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,714
and I figured why not have a belt
with the old man.

15
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,550
Yeah.

16
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,388
She looks good.

17
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,350
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

18
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,396
Well, you always did take good care of her.

19
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,357
Paddy Conlon.

20
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,069
Man of priorities.

21
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,580
I got a little something for you.

22
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,749
Mom always said,
"Never go anywhere empty-handed."

23
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,084
She did.

24
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,921
That's not for me anymore, Tommy.

25
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,635
What? You changed brands?

26
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,016
Let's go inside, huh?

27
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,602
Tommy!

28
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,272
Come on, let's go inside.

29
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,130
I like what you've done with the place.

30
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,674
Yeah, I appreciate that.

31
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,803
There's not much of a woman's touch
around here.

32
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,640
Yeah, well...

33
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,393
And no more women for me, Tommy.

34
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,104
Yeah.

35
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,400
It must be hard to find a girl
who can take a punch nowadays.

36
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,575
Here you go.

37
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,245
Coffee?

38
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,167
You haven't seen a guy in 14 years
and you're not gonna have a drink with him?

39
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,378
- Come on.
- I told you, I'm off it, Tommy.

40
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,338
I'm coming up on 1,000 days.

41
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:04,345
- Come on, it's just a drink.
- No.

42
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,959
He's a school teacher down in Philly.

43
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,212
Remember Tess?

44
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,007
They had two beautiful little girls.

45
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,494
So, you found God, huh? That's awesome.

46
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,331
I think Mom kept calling out for him,
but he wasn't around.

47
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,796
I guess Jesus was down at the mill
forgiving all the drunks, huh?

48
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,216
Who knew?

49
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,850
So, you gonna ask about her,

50
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,770
or you just gonna sit there all sober?

51
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,483
- I know.
- You know? What do you know? Huh?

52
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,778
Do you know it wasn't enough to drive west
to get away from you,

53
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,572
that once we hit the water,
we drove north, too?

54
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,367
When I got sober, I hired
a man to find you.

55
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,746
And is that one of the 1 2 steps?

56
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,999
Or does a guy like you get 24?

57
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,295
Just 1 2.

58
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,386
Did your guy tell you
what you needed to know?

59
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,140
Just that your mother died in Tacoma.

60
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,352
But you were in the Marines.

61
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,604
That was all.

62
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,357
That was enough.

63
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,862
Well, that's too bad,

64
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,158
'cause you could've gotten
some good details.

65
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:36,205
You could've heard about her
coughing up blood on her knees

66
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,166
in a shit box with no heat.

67
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:45,881
Having me rub her down with holy water,
because, well, she didn't have no insurance.

68
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,637
All the time waiting for your pal,
Jesus, to save her.

69
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,432
Did your man tell you that?

70
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,105
I'm sorry, Tommy.

71
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,365
Well, it's good to know
that you're sorry, Pop.

72
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,494
It goes a long way.

73
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,962
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

74
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,145
All right, then.
All right, all right, all right.

75
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,855
You say I can, but you say I can't.

76
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,150
- What about if we all get a unicorn?
- No.

77
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,776
- Don't you want a unicorn?
- No.

78
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,407
What's going on up here?

79
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,159
- Oh, my goodness.
- Well, I'm not sure,

80
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,871
but I think Daddy is now a princess.

81
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,749
- Daddy, you look so handsome.
- Do l?

82
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,584
- He's a very pretty princess.
- We're painting Daddy's face.

83
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,753
Yeah, you are.

84
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,759
Okay. Yeah.
Em, you wanna open your presents?

85
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,013
- Yeah? You wanna do present time? Okay.
- Yeah. All right, come on. Ready?

86
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,682
- All right! It's time for presents!
- I have to put this down.

87
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,726
- Here. You wanna put it down?
- Presents time!

88
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,728
- Everybody, come bring your presents!
- What is it? What is it?

89
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,607
Let's start with this one.
How about that, Emily?

90
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,942
- All right.
- Happy birthday, Emily.

91
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,654
- What did you get? What did you get?
- Babe?

92
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,448
It's an awfully big box.

93
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,325
It's her birthday. Come on.

94
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,160
I know, babe,
but that's why you call it a budget.

95
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,829
You set it and you don't budge.

96
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,831
- This one's mine.
- Hey, open the big box!

97
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,375
It's okay.

98
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,005
- I love you. Be good, okay?
- Bye, Mommy.

99
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,341
Daddy's gonna give you a bath.

100
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,844
- Hey, babe. I'm late.
- Hey.

101
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,347
Mom's saying goodbye to the girls,
she's got to get on the road.

102
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,809
- They've been fed, they just need a bath.
- I'm on it.

103
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,228
Okay, can you get them to bed
at a reasonable time tonight?

104
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,562
Because, after the party,
they're just exhausted.

105
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,940
Where's the rest of that skirt?

106
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,358
Babe.

107
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,735
Listen, if any guys give you a hassle
in that joint tonight,

108
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,195
you give me a call, okay?

109
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,155
Yeah, just like you gave me a call
when those Temple frat boys

110
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,990
decided to smash up your face.

111
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,243
I told you, most nights,
l sit on the stool and grade papers,

112
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,413
but, every now and then,
l need some action.

113
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:27,418
All right. Well, wait up for me tonight.
I'll see what I can do about that.

114
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,169
Promises, promises.

115
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,720
And we return here on MMA Live,

116
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,140
Jon Anik, alongside the billionaire
fighting promoter, J.J. Riley,

117
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,267
the Tapout crew is here,
Punk and Skrape are in the building.

118
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,269
Now, J.J., what led to this project

119
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,813
that is really redefining
mixed martial arts here in the States?

120
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,358
Well, mixed martial arts is a sport
I've been incredibly passionate about,

121
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,111
and as far as where
the idea for Sparta came from,

122
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,990
I've always really dug the Grand Prix
format, so I tracked these guys down.

123
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,242
And when J.J. came to us,
he said he wanted to create

124
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,869
the Super Bowl of mixed martial arts.

125
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,038
And he decided to put up
the $5 million purse, too.

126
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,084
Well, there you have it, it shall be done.
Hedge fund king, J.J. Riley,

127
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,712
going from the lions' den of Wall Street
to the cage,

128
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:16,467
and promoting the biggest winner-take-all
tournament in MMA history. Sparta...

129
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,593
Doing good. One more time.

130
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,720
Fitzy still own this?

131
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,056
I don't know no Fitzy.
Colt Boyd owns this gym.

132
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,809
Can I help you with something?

133
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,396
How does it work?

134
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,398
Thirty-five a month with locker.

135
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,651
We're open at 7:00, lights out at 11 :00.

136
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,155
So you want to join?

137
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,740
Sure.

138
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,536
Put your name and contact info on the card.

139
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,664
Thank you.

140
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,678
All right.
There's a lesson in this, too, okay?

141
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,013
Hold on, Tito.

142
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,306
So, we have a body at rest,

143
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,892
and you have the bat which needs...

144
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,852
- Acceleration.
- Acceleration, okay.

145
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,271
If you have enough acceleration,

146
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,940
you might have a chance
of breaking the body at rest.

147
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,650
- Okay. All right. You ready?
- Piece of cake.

148
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,319
Everybody got the glasses on? Okay, go!
Piece of cake!

149
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:18,862
Come on, man!

150
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,698
Come on, son!

151
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,621
All right! All right. There we go.
Well done, Tito. Well done.

152
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,624
Remind me not to mess with you.

153
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,670
Sit down, everybody. Dial it down.

154
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,047
So, have we got it?

155
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,758
Force equals mass times acceleration,
we got it.

156
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,301
All right. Has everybody else got it?

157
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,470
- Yeah.
- Yes? Okay, good. All right.

158
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,305
The third law...

159
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,474
How many laws this dude got?

160
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,393
- The dude?
- Yes, the dude.

161
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,353
The dude has three, all right?

162
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,315
Newton, the dude, says that
for every action,

163
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,319
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

164
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,738
For example,

165
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,993
if K.C. does not stop the action
of sending texts in class

166
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,787
and tell her posse outside to beat it,

167
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,624
then my reaction might be to send her
down to Principal Zito's office.

168
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,003
Thus setting the world back
in proper balance.

169
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,337
Mr. C, I put it away.

170
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,844
All right, before you go,
l have your tests from last week.

171
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,805
Just work it out.

172
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,473
Stop clowning.

173
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,726
Pick up the hands.

174
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,522
Tighten it up!

175
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,567
Use your right.

176
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,194
Seal his hands, come on.

177
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,947
Seal his hands. Keep your hands up!

178
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,991
Go light!

179
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,036
I said, go light!

180
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,124
God damn it!

181
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,169
Where do you find these girls?

182
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,174
We got a tournament coming up,
you're gonna play every guy in the 'Burgh?

183
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,259
Oh, jeez.

184
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,345
Fenroy, get me some ice.

185
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,139
And call that Puerto Rican kid,
the one that fights out of the bottoms.

186
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,142
If he's here in 20 minutes,
he gets 200 bucks.

187
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,852
Yo, I'll fight him.

188
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,562
Do me a favor, guy, go back to your bag.

189
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,898
We don't need anybody else getting hurt.
Take a walk.

190
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,400
Let's go. Watch his neck.

191
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,694
Yo, Rock, what did you do,

192
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,488
did you leave Mick and Paulie
at home today?

193
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:30,953
His phone's disconnected.

194
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,747
Then go through the list.
Find me somebody. Get me Joe Bones.

195
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,292
All I'm saying is
that if you need somebody to help you,

196
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,088
I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you.

197
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,684
You ever fought before?

198
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,768
Yeah.

199
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,606
Hey, this guy signed a waiver?

200
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,734
All good.

201
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,073
- What's your name?
- Tommy.

202
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,743
- You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tom.
- Sure, no problem. No problem.

203
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,288
Come on in.

204
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,257
Let's go. All right, let's go.

205
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,300
Hey. Watch that teeth.

206
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,512
Are you gonna be a hero? All right.

207
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,811
Come on. Check that kick.

208
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,271
Easy.

209
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,982
Come on, Dog, you can do it.
Let's go, come on.

210
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,819
- Good jab. Good jab!
- There we go!

211
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,162
No, he won't. Don't let him take your back.
Don't let him take your back!

212
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,246
- Dog, get up.
- Get up!

213
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,249
Cover up, cover up!

214
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,835
Don't give him your back.
Don't give him your back!

215
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,174
- Cover up!
- Come on, Dog!

216
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,135
Cover up, damn it!

217
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,738
You owe me 200 bucks.

218
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,092
This one here.
See, this is the new appraisal figures

219
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,259
- that came in.
- Yeah.

220
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,512
And this is how it affects the monthly,
it turns into that.

221
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,473
And the total value of the loan,
over the life of the loan, is that.

222
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,808
As you can see, that's just the way it is.

223
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,518
It puts you upside down,
that's the problem.

224
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,770
It's the county that did the assessment,
not the bank.

225
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,231
So, the numbers are what they are,
Mr. Conlon...

226
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,399
- Brendan.
- The numbers are what they are, Brendan.

227
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,485
I mean, you're a math teacher, right?
You can appreciate that.

228
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,279
I'm a physics teacher. I teach physics.

229
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,908
Physics, okay. But the bank has got to go
by the new appraisal figures.

230
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,661
And, according to these figures,
you're upside down on your mortgage,

231
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,412
- you understand?
- God, you said that like three times.

232
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,456
I'm sorry, but I get that.

233
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,835
I am asking you,
is there something else you can do?

234
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,421
Not the bank, you.
Can you shift things around, restructure?

235
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,006
You refinanced twice already.

236
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,758
'Cause you advised us to do that.

237
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,219
- You told me.
- Well, I presented you with that option,

238
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,595
but that was your choice.

239
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,475
I'm also showing that you netted
a substantial payout with the refi.

240
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,894
We had that conversation.

241
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,314
I was paying medical bills.

242
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,360
Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's kidney?

243
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,280
- Heart.
- Heart. Right, sorry.

244
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,740
A lot of stories.

245
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,870
All right, so, if that's my option,
l have no options.

246
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,205
You're not even gonna try and help me.
You're not even gonna try.

247
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,083
No, I'm trying. Look, Brendan,
l can get you 90 days to get even.

248
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,210
Ninety days is not enough.

249
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,964
My wife and l,
we have three jobs between us.

250
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,676
And that doesn't cut it.

251
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,304
So, what do you suggest?

252
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,974
Well, let me ask you a question?
Have you thought about bankruptcy?

253
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,143
It's a viable option.

254
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,146
There's no shame in this these days.

255
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,611
That's not how I do things.

256
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,824
Okay, well, then
you're looking at foreclosure.

257
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,670
Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,
the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh.

258
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,299
The prodigy has yet to yield a single point
in the entire tournament.

259
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,593
Tommy, trained by his father
since the age of five.

260
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,512
- Talking about Paddy Conlon?
- The controversial Paddy Conlon.

261
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,223
Say what you will about the methods
of the former Marine,

262
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,018
but he's led his son
to six straight Junior Olympic titles

263
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,854
and now just moments away
from a High School State Championship.

264
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,106
And there it is! Wow!

265
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,109
There's just no limit
to what the future holds for this kid.

266
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,779
Tommy told me that he's chasing
the record of Theogenes,

267
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,616
apparently, a mythical Greek fighter
said to be undefeated in over 1,400 bouts.

268
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,788
Hi, how're you doing, sir?
I'm looking for Tommy Riordan.

269
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,499
- Who?
- Tommy Riordan.

270
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,459
My name is Colt Boyd.

271
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,380
What business you got with Tommy?

272
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,591
Well, none yet, that's why I'm here.
l manage fighters.

273
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,596
So, Tommy's been working out at my gym,

274
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,560
and he put a beating on the number one
middleweight contender in the world today.

275
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,981
So, I want to know
a little bit more about the guy.

276
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,983
Maybe help him out.

277
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,527
I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

278
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,113
Conlon. The name is Conlon.

279
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,825
And anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

280
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,618
you gotta ask him yourself.

281
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,745
Look, I'm just asking
for some general information here.

282
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,289
Like I said, anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

283
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,916
you gotta ask him yourself.

284
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,668
Look, I don't mean
to interrupt your night, okay?

285
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,087
He just put this address down
when he signed up at the gym.

286
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,089
He doesn't live here.

287
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,427
- All right, then.
- Okay. Good night.

288
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,564
All right, listen, kiddo.
l need you to put Mommy back on, okay?

289
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,774
I love you.

290
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,944
Hey. Hey, listen, I'm just pulling in,
I'm gonna have to go.

291
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,576
No, they got an open mic night thing on,
it's gonna be a quiet one.

292
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,121
All right, sleep well.

293
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,664
You, too. All right, bye.

294
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,797
It's about time for your next contest.

295
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:03,219
Introducing first, in the red corner,
he fights out of Ripley, West Virginia.

296
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:08,099
Please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore.

297
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,267
Say, "Uncle!"

298
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,852
Go, Mike. Go!

299
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:20,028
And his opponent in the blue corner, he
fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

300
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:24,491
Please welcome "Irish" Brendan Conlon.

301
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:32,081
This bout is scheduled
for three, five-minute rounds,

302
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:36,044
and when the action begins,
your referee is Mr. Rick Fike.

303
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,671
Fighters to the center.

304
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,425
Come on, gentlemen.

305
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,594
I want you to obey my commands
at all times.

306
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,805
I want you to protect
yourselves at all times.

307
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,224
If you have no questions,
touch gloves, back up.

308
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,810
And on my signal, let's come out fighting.

309
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,776
Fighter, are you ready?

310
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,194
Are you ready?

311
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,445
Do it!

312
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,873
Come on, Mike, let's go!

313
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,511
You gotta move with that one.

314
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,737
Come on, Mike!

315
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,250
Don't let him do that to you, Mike!

316
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:02,964
Get up, Mike, get up!

317
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,734
- First five minutes, out.
- Another 1 5? Great.

318
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,779
Hey! Hey, kid!

319
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,450
Nice fight.
Two more wins, you take home the bacon.

320
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:31,826
Hey, good job...

321
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,717
Hey, babe.

322
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,052
Hey.

323
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,999
How was work?

324
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,089
Oh, my God!

325
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,843
What happened?

326
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,972
You said it was gonna be a slow night.

327
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,893
I'm not bouncing at a club.

328
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,023
What do you mean you're not bouncing?

329
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,210
You've been lying to me?

330
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,049
I went in to apply

331
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,389
and they were paying nine bucks an hour.

332
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,814
Then I saw a sign for this other thing.

333
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,823
They're putting us out of the house
in three months.

334
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,991
We're running out of options.

335
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,743
Then they put us out of the house
in three months.

336
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,578
I'd rather go back to the old apartment

337
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,748
than see you in the back
of an ambulance again.

338
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,917
I thought we agreed
that we weren't gonna raise our children

339
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:48,588
in a family where their father
gets beat up for a living.

340
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,094
We're not giving up the house.

341
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,013
It's our home.

342
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,974
We're not going backwards.

343
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,822
We'll figure it out.

344
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,911
This is what we're not going back to.

345
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,679
You wanted to talk?

346
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,557
Yeah.

347
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,103
I'm gonna start fighting.

348
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:28,980
Ls that right?

349
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,106
Don't play babe in the woods with me.

350
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,525
I know that guy from the gym
came to see you.

351
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,110
Colt Boyd.

352
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,321
Yeah. I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.

353
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,825
I wouldn't be sitting here
with you now if you did.

354
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,202
- Paddy, can I get you more coffee?
- No. Thank you. I'm fine.

355
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,289
- Hon, would you like a cup of coffee? Okay.
- Sure. Thank you.

356
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,418
All right.

357
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,587
There's this tournament,

358
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,255
it's a big tournament.

359
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,634
Top 1 6 middleweights in the world.
Single elimination.

360
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,512
Winner takes all. It's a lot of money.

361
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,974
- Okay.
- I'm gonna do that.

362
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,936
But if I'm doing it,

363
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,067
then I'm gonna need a trainer.

364
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,904
Now, that much, you were good at.

365
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,449
What?

366
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,577
No, no, no.
This doesn't mean anything, okay?

367
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,746
I'm serious.

368
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,873
We train. That's it.

369
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,500
I don't want to hear a word
about anything but training.

370
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,127
You understand?

371
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:37,131
You want to tell your war stories,
you can take them down to the VFW.

372
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,593
Or you can take it to a
meeting, or to church,

373
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,095
or whatever the hell it is
that you do nowadays.

374
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,889
What about Colt Boyd?

375
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,475
What about him? I told him I don't
train with people that I don't know.

376
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,977
- The devil you know.
- Excuse me?

377
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:54,106
The devil you know
is better than the devil you don't.

378
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,778
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

379
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,072
There's your coffee, hon.

380
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:02,990
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

381
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:07,620
Chasing Theogenes.
it'll be kind of like the old times.

382
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,374
I just told you, this
doesn't mean anything.

383
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,253
Now, get that through your skull right now
or I'm walking.

384
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,171
All right. All right.

385
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,882
But you get something
through your skull, too.

386
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:24,136
You called me, so don't go
threatening to walk every five minutes.

387
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,307
And since this is about training,

388
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:32,270
you dump whatever it is you need to dump
as far as those pills are concerned.

389
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,272
I don't wanna see them.

390
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,483
In fact, hand them over right now.

391
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,404
I know they're on you, Tommy.

392
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,241
You sounded like a goddamn maraca
coming through the door.

393
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,921
That's not gonna do.

394
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,677
When you came through that door, it was...

395
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,639
Three.

396
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,731
That'a boy.

397
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:21,110
And another thing.
You don't eat crap like this.

398
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,362
This is for losers and old men.

399
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,116
And we're gonna have to bunk up.

400
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,452
If we're gonna do this right,
you're gonna stay at the house.

401
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,205
I watch your diet.
We follow the old regimen.

402
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,083
You copy?

403
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:39,712
All right.

404
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,548
Copy.

405
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:57,897
Your brother's a liar.

406
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,482
- ...went in the middle of the night...
- Yeah.

407
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,068
And he went to a strip club,
and he said he saw Mr. C...

408
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,361
- No way.
- Front and center.

409
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,738
- Like MMA type stuff.
- You weren't there, so you don't know.

410
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,822
What's MMA?

411
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:07,865
- Mixed martial arts.
- Like, fighting.

412
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,325
Like, different styles of fighting.

413
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,744
He was just, like,
dropped him on the floor...

414
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,125
It's true?

415
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,127
Take your seats.

416
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,545
Now, please.

417
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,809
Hey, yo, Mr. C.

418
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,311
Hey, my brother was at the titty bar
last night,

419
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,940
and he said you was choking brothers out.
l mean, what's up, is it true?

420
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,109
Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, like, is it true?

421
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,027
Did you really work on some fools
or something?

422
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,029
- You have to tell us.
- Yeah.

423
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,377
All right.
l want examples of forms of energy.

424
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,566
Come on. It's not as bad as it looks.

425
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:28,737
Are you being literal or figurative?
Because, literally, it looks bad.

426
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:32,283
And figuratively, it looks even worse.

427
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,577
The superintendent's coming by.
Few minutes.

428
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,539
Oh, man.

429
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,834
So, come on, Brendan.
Give me a little help here.

430
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:46,338
I mean, could you explain to me
what the hell you were doing?

431
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,678
I need the money, Joe.

432
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,431
Yeah, but this is...

433
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,224
We can't have this.

434
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,644
This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's,
for Christ's sake.

435
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,606
Shit, Brendan.

436
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,609
Leaving everything else aside,
which we can't,

437
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,527
are you out of your mind?

438
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,779
You're gonna get yourself killed.

439
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,448
I mean, you're a goddamn teacher.

440
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,034
You got no business in the ring
with those animals.

441
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,622
Actually, I used to be
one of those animals.

442
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,668
I fought for a living.

443
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,256
Guess I forgot to put that down
on my application.

444
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,052
Yeah, I guess you did.

445
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,513
Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just...

446
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,432
Look, look,
the school district is not gonna tolerate

447
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,601
teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.

448
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,312
It was a parking lot of a strip club.

449
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,773
Wherever it was, you can't be doing it.

450
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:50,778
All right? I mean, this is a serious...
Shit, he's here.

451
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,239
This is a serious problem.

452
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,788
Guy hasn't been inside
a school since 9/11.

453
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,417
What are we gonna do?

454
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,505
You say, "Yes, sir," and
you say, "No, sir,"

455
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,550
and you say,
"it will never happen again, sir."

456
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,971
And then we just pray to God
that he's in a good mood.

457
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,311
UFC?

458
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,107
Yeah.

459
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,818
Son of a bitch.

460
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,447
- Superintendent Yorn. Good to see you, sir.
- Principal Zito.

461
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,551
What are you doing?

462
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,513
Well,

463
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,975
the girls have an important piano recital
in the morning.

464
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,854
And we have an equipment malfunction.

465
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,610
How'd it go?

466
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:17,573
They're gonna review your case
at the end of the semester.

467
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:22,161
But until then,
you're suspended without pay.

468
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,503
Joe gave me the number of his attorney.

469
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,215
How the hell are we gonna pay
for an attorney?

470
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,469
He talked to me for free as a favor to Joe.

471
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,763
That's nice.

472
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,514
He said there's no precedent for this.

473
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,768
You'll be back by next semester.

474
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,853
The next semester?

475
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,615
Tess,

476
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,869
they have these smoker fights all over.

477
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:09,833
There's one in Lancaster next week,
there's two in Dover the week after.

478
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,045
Wilmington, Camden, Baltimore.

479
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,885
That could keep us afloat.

480
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:25,182
You're gonna put yourself through this
over and over for 500 bucks a pop?

481
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,437
Some of them pay a lot more than that.

482
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:37,319
I would have to bounce for a month to
make what I made in two hours last night.

483
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,239
Yeah.

484
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:45,369
And these guys, they're not real fighters.

485
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,998
They're just guys that have seen
too much UFC on TV.

486
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,550
Now, if you have a better solution,

487
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,927
I'm all ears, but...

488
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,391
And what are we gonna tell the girls?

489
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,519
It'll be fine.

490
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,188
I'll just leave the house as usual,

491
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:16,316
except, only this time,
I'll be going to the gym.

492
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,957
The duck goes
quack, quack, quack, quack.

493
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,837
And the cow goes moo, moo, moo!

494
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:42,092
But that rooster
That rooster, he knew everything.

495
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:47,723
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

496
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,601
Let's go, kiddo. Let's get moving.

497
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,146
Look what I found

498
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,857
in that disaster of a...

499
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,235
basement.

500
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,698
What do you say we sit down

501
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,910
and update this?

502
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:13,457
And you can fill me in
on how close you got to that record.

503
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:21,298
Did you continue wrestling
after you left with your mother?

504
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,096
Come on, Tommy. Tell me something.

505
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,184
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

506
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,897
You can take that back
to where you found it,

507
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,441
you can leave the coffee in the pot.

508
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,319
I can pour that myself.

509
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,863
And I can wake myself up, too.

510
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,919
Hurt my knees
coming up and down those stairs.

511
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,462
Yeah?

512
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:05,092
I'll leave the coffee pot on until 0500,
then I dump it.

513
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,185
I give command dismiss.
You'll wash your nasty bodies.

514
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,981
You can square your gear away.

515
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,775
Corporal Bradford, take this to CSC,
let them know we're back.

516
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,277
Roger, sir.

517
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,488
Detail, a-ten-hut!

518
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,449
7-3-4, this is Gealer Base.
Sitrep, over.

519
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,662
What's up, Mark?

520
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,331
Here, sir. William's Company's back in.

521
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,458
Damn, dude! That's brutal.

522
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,210
- Did you see that? Oh, my God.
- What?

523
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,378
What's that?

524
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:45,173
Dude, Mad Dog Grimes is getting tuned up
by some dude at a gym in Pittsburgh.

525
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,717
Who is Mad Dog Grimes?

526
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,261
Shit, Bradford,
the stuff you don't know amazes me.

527
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,097
- Dude. Oh, my God, did you see that?
- Wow. Oh, my God.

528
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,558
- Wait. Rewind that.
- Okay.

529
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,563
Right there, pause, pause, pause.

530
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,151
What's up, man?

531
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,363
Dude, what's his deal?

532
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,287
You're not gonna get your 11.

533
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,457
- AV, I need to see the tape.
- What tape?

534
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,459
- What tape?
- The tape!

535
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,797
Hoolihan, fill in for me?

536
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,215
Get the camera.

537
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:08,674
That's him.

538
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:13,553
Let the music sink into you.
This is Beethoven.

539
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:17,140
I want you to breathe. I don't want
you boxing like this. No more stiff, right?

540
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,227
You listen to the music.
You relax, you breathe. One, two...

541
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:27,943
Again. One, two. One, two. One, two.

542
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,199
Good.

543
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,702
Good, good, good. Yos.

544
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,456
You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it.
All right? Two more rounds.

545
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:48,839
Do I know you?

546
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,551
- Oh, man!
- Wow.

547
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,470
- Long time, brother. Too long.
- How you doing?

548
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:56,847
- Too long.
- Look at your place.

549
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,931
- You like?
- Yeah.

550
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,852
You see this beast? Marco Santos.

551
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,812
- He's training for Sparta.
- Yeah, right.

552
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,272
Not bad, right?

553
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,065
It's amazing, man.

554
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,944
Only the best. Move! Move! Move!
Move or die!

555
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,740
- You look good, brother.
- Thanks.

556
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,163
How are the girls?

557
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,082
Good. Yeah.
l had another little one, Rosie.

558
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:28,170
I know. I know because Johnny C. told me
that she was in the hospital for a bit.

559
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,546
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

560
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,716
You know,

561
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,679
l was gonna call you
and then time went by and...

562
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,598
I'm a piece of shit.
l should've called you. I'm sorry.

563
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,682
- No. Come on.
- No.

564
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,352
Brendan, I'm sorry.

565
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,314
It's all good. She's good now.

566
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,357
- She's okay?
- So beautiful.

567
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:58,200
It's good to see you, man.
So everything's going great, huh?

568
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,701
Yeah.

569
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,164
Well, I've got a little problem.

570
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,211
The guys at the bank
want to take my house away.

571
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,046
- What?
- Yeah.

572
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,633
That's kind of why
l came to see you, actually.

573
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:22,474
You know, I got most of my dough
tied up in this joint,

574
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,725
but how much do you need?

575
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,644
I didn't come here for a loan, Frank.

576
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,480
I mean, I was hoping that

577
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,943
you would train me.

578
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,736
Train you for what?

579
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,155
I wanna get back in the cage.

580
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,491
Are you serious?

581
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,246
Come on, Brendan.

582
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,164
I won an event the other night.

583
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,293
You won an event. That's what this is.

584
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:54,047
Let me guess. It was in a parking lot?
DJ from a local radio station,

585
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:57,634
a couple of ring card girls
you wouldn't bang on a dare? Am I right?

586
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,221
- Ish.
- Ish.

587
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,683
Brendan. I love you.

588
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,185
Why am I gonna train you?

589
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,856
When you were on the right side of 30,
you were barely a .500 fighter.

590
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,942
You never listened to me.

591
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:17,404
You don't listen to anyone.
These guys are animals.

592
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,576
You're a teacher, right?
What are you gonna do?

593
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,204
You're gonna come down here
a couple of days a week after detention?

594
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:29,875
You're gonna skip out
of the girls' volleyball game early?

595
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,878
I've got loads of time.
Time's not an issue.

596
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,132
Parking lot thing kind of got me suspended.

597
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,683
I need to keep working the smokers.

598
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,147
Tess know about this?

599
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,648
Yeah?

600
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,942
'Cause the last time you fought,
l got read the riot act,

601
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,904
sitting in a hospital waiting room.
You remember that?

602
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:01,114
I was unconscious.

603
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,118
- You were more than unconscious.
- I was.

604
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:09,539
She's not gonna come down here
with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?

605
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:13,293
It's not gonna happen.

606
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,419
What do you say, Frank?

607
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,298
What do I say?
What am I gonna say to you? "No"?

608
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,468
I mean, all my time
is wrapped up with Marco.

609
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,596
You know, you come down, I throw you
in a rotation, you spar with these guys.

610
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,267
But I can't promise you
much more than that, Brendan.

611
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,727
That's all I need.

612
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,063
Great. All right.

613
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,606
Yeah.

614
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,733
- I appreciate it.
- What, are you kidding me?

615
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,110
- You need anything, you call me.
- I will.

616
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,528
Let me know when you're coming down.

617
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,156
Well, I'm just gonna get
my stuff from the car.

618
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,575
Now?

619
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,728
Hey, Brendan.

620
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:17,107
Brendan, it's me, Pop.

621
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,947
What are you doing here?

622
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,157
I have some news for you.

623
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,080
Something wrong with your hands?

624
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,498
- No.
- if there's nothing wrong with your hands,

625
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,958
there's no reason for you not to phone.

626
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,585
- That's the deal.
- Yeah. I forgot.

627
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,713
The phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.

628
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,842
Hey, Brendan.
You ever seen my hands so steady?

629
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,510
Ever seen that?

630
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,264
I'm going inside.

631
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,683
I got 1,000 days, Brendan.

632
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,185
Thousand days sober, today.

633
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,939
Well, that's great, Pop,
but it doesn't change anything.

634
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,149
What do you mean,
doesn't change anything?

635
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,318
Have a heart, Brendan.

636
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,778
You listen to me.

637
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,906
You take your "have a heart" bullshit
and you run it down the road.

638
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,076
Yeah, run it out with someone
that doesn't know you like I do.

639
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:14,497
All right, listen to me.
l thought maybe we could break bread.

640
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,792
You know,
just open some lines of communication.

641
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:23,131
You got two lines of communication.
You got the telephone and the post office.

642
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,632
God! Just 'cause you decide
it's a special day,

643
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:25,884
it doesn't make it one for me.

644
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,969
I've got a wife and kids inside,
and they're waiting for me,

645
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,721
so I don't have time for whatever this is.

646
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:33,600
I know you got a wife and kid in there.
I've got a granddaughter in there

647
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,477
l haven't seen in three years.

648
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,312
And another one I haven't even ever met.

649
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,398
Yeah. Why is that, Pop?

650
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,400
Why is that?

651
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:46,529
Do you remember
having anything to do with that?

652
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,531
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

653
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,910
That shit you pulled.

654
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,330
Never again.

655
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,874
And all that shit I saw growing up,

656
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,503
- that doesn't happen here.
- Look...

657
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:04,923
Take care of yourself.

658
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,219
Tommy's back.

659
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,519
He's in the 'Burgh.

660
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,191
You say Tommy's in Pittsburgh?

661
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,568
Yeah, he came to see me.

662
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,030
He came to see you?

663
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,784
Yeah. He's over at the house.

664
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,831
We're doing a little training at Fitzy's.

665
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,624
You remember Fitzy's?

666
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,584
It ain't Fitzy's anymore.

667
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,630
You and Tommy are training together?

668
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,382
Yeah.

669
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,385
- Tommy Conlon?
- Riordan.

670
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,471
- He's using your mother's maiden name.
- Yeah, I know what her name is.

671
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:58,268
Well, I thought you'd wanna know he's back.
So that's why I drove all the way over here.

672
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,395
I thought you came to break bread
over 1,000 days.

673
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,731
No, I did, Brendan, that's most important.

674
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,608
That, too.

675
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,155
All right.
Did he say if he wants to see me?

676
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,575
He doesn't say much, Brendan.

677
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,667
He's just not that happy kid he was,
you know?

678
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,920
- Wow. Look at you.
- What?

679
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:27,172
Mr. inside Man.

680
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,090
Inside? What?

681
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,219
You and Tommy training together like
nothing ever happened. It's unbelievable.

682
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,013
- Look...
- Now I know what you're really doing here.

683
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,514
- What's that?
- You came to gloat.

684
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,350
I did not come to gloat.
l came to get my son back.

685
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,603
Wow. There you go.
Yeah, you got your son back.

686
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,689
- No, I'm talking about you, Brendan. You.
- You got your son back.

687
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,529
You know...

688
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,325
Forget it.

689
00:49:55,534 --> 00:50:01,539
Yeah, I'll tell you. Part of the reason...
Part of the reason I stuck around,

690
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,708
'cause I thought I'd finally get you
all to myself.

691
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,672
But you didn't have any interest
in training me.

692
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,176
- You thought Tommy was the one.
- Brendan, I was a drunk.

693
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,304
I mean, you know, Brendan, I'm sorry.

694
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,388
Forget it.

695
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:23,019
You were always a frontrunner.
Never had any interest in the underdogs.

696
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,399
- But I was your son.
- You are my son, Brendan.

697
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,652
- Am l?
- Yeah, you are.

698
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,657
I'm just asking you if you can find...

699
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:42,830
Find a little bit of space in your heart
to forgive me a little bit.

700
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:49,170
Yeah? All right, I forgive you.

701
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,216
- Okay.
- But I do not trust you.

702
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,930
Listen, tell Tommy, if he wants to see me,
this is where I am.

703
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,267
- Okay. But they're not different things.
- All right?

704
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,269
You gotta trust to forgive.

705
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,354
Night, Pop.

706
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,564
My God.

707
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:11,651
Ls that Emily? Jeez, she's grown, Brendan.

708
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,529
- ls that Rosie?
- Daddy, who is that?

709
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,948
It's just a nice, old man.
Come on. Let's go.

710
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,950
How about a cup of coffee?

711
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,844
Huge news just broken here at ESPN

712
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,015
that Koba is coming to America
and will fight at Sparta.

713
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,809
Universally considered
the greatest pound-for-pound fighter

714
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,937
who ever lived, the mighty,
mythical Russian has never fought

715
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:50,273
on US soil in his legendary career.

716
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,568
Slow to half guard.
Slow to half guard, hammer fist.

717
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:58,865
Now start on the other side.
And slip back in, there you go.

718
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,284
Tommy,

719
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,745
l got some news for you.

720
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,871
I got you into Sparta.

721
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,789
It took some doing,

722
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,916
but I made it happen.

723
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,965
You know thank you and 1 0% is customary?

724
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,235
Pilar? Hey, it's Tommy.

725
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,529
Tommy?

726
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,412
Okay. Sorry.

727
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:50,875
Good. I'm good. How are you doing?

728
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:55,129
Okay. You know me, Tommy.

729
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,632
I was getting really worried about you.

730
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:02,053
How's things? How are the kids?
The kids good?

731
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,388
Yeah, they're good.

732
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,432
- Maria's getting so big.
- Yeah?

733
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,228
She looks more and more like Manny
every day.

734
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:15,733
- How's little man?
- He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy.

735
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:19,612
He's a real good boy.
He takes care of his sister.

736
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,989
- He's a great kid. Everyone's good.
- Good.

737
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,908
- We're good.
- Good.

738
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,578
You know...

739
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:32,625
Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute

740
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,837
what I promised you.

741
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:41,300
What I promised Manny.
I got opportunities coming up, so...

742
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,844
Whatever you can do, Tommy.

743
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,513
Help you guys out.
I'm gonna take care of you guys.

744
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,975
I know. Manny would really appreciate it.

745
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,602
- I wanna help you.
- You know what? You worry too much.

746
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:54,856
You worry so much about us. It's okay.

747
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,233
You know what? We're hanging in there.

748
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:01,195
"Captain Pollard once more sailed
for the Pacific in command of another ship,

749
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,491
"but the gods shipwrecked him again
upon unknown rocks and breakers.

750
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:08,828
"For the second time,
his ship was utterly lost,

751
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,248
"and forthwith forswearing the sea,
he has never tempted it since."

752
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:16,210
Stop for a second. Listen to the music.
This is Beethoven.

753
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:20,381
Could you do another thing?
Or are you gonna do the same thing?

754
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:24,010
I need you to relax and listen.
Forget about how to lose the fight.

755
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,137
And two, and three.

756
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,847
With eight weeks left to Sparta,

757
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,724
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew

758
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,727
take time out from their international
press tour to join us.

759
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,480
J.J., we've never seen
this kind of Grand Prix tournament

760
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:38,566
in this country before.
Tell us, why the unique format?

761
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,570
Well, look, Jon, you know as well as anyone
that in mixed martial arts,

762
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,864
anyone can beat anyone on a given night.

763
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,699
But with this type of format,

764
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,410
it's gonna be tough
to deny who the champion is.

765
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:54,457
You got four fights in two nights,
16 fighters down to one,

766
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,250
winner's gonna be the last man standing.

767
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:58,294
Thirty-one. Thirty-two!

768
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:01,964
Breathe, breathe. Keep your eyes open.

769
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,759
You gotta keep moving.
You gotta keep moving. Keep moving.

770
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:08,596
Good! And listen to the music. You breathe.
He's getting it. He's getting it.

771
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:11,265
You see? You feel it? Feel the music.

772
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,392
- Come on!
- Nice.

773
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,395
Come on, baby!

774
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,982
With Rashad Evans and Stephan Bonnar
and just five weeks left until Sparta,

775
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:24,070
as the hype continues for the war
on the shore this Fourth of July weekend

776
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,072
in Atlantic City. You know what that means.

777
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,908
The great Koba bringing his act stateside.

778
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,785
But I gotta ask you about the other guys.

779
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,830
What are they thinking,
entering a winner-take-all tournament

780
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,540
against a guy
that seemingly can't be beaten?

781
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,334
They're thinking $5 million
and $5 million seems a lot of money,

782
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,962
but they gotta remember one thing.
They're going against Koba.

783
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,422
Mission impossible, game over, go home.

784
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,174
Well, the winner takes home $5 million.

785
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,927
You can be sure
this will dominate the sports landscape.

786
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,887
Fourth of July weekend in Atlantic City.

787
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:54,016
The great Koba making his presence felt
in the United States.

788
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:55,560
Two... Come on, Tommy.

789
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,854
Hits you soft, right? Flow like water.

790
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,772
Get on your arm,
watch what's gonna happen.

791
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:03,025
There it is. Look, look, look.
He's going to sleep.

792
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,611
You train with the best
to be the best, Brendan.

793
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,660
Pittsburgh Beatdown has become
one of the most watched videos

794
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,453
on YouTube this year.

795
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,874
Now joining us, via satellite,
is the victim of the infamous incident,

796
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,041
Mad Dog Grimes.

797
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:23,004
Mad Dog, what is your response
to all the hoopla surrounding the video

798
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,171
and Tommy Riordan?

799
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:26,799
This guy's a nobody.
It's a sparring session.

800
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,385
It is what it is,
and he's gonna pay for it next month

801
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,888
in Atlantic City.

802
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,223
Good. Always move. Always move.

803
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,727
I don't know, Marco. You're getting
a good game here from a physics teacher.

804
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:39,937
Good! Good.

805
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,773
You see? You see? Beautiful.

806
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:46,110
Top of the food chain.
He's the next champ, right here.

807
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:56,287
So, with Sparta now
just two short weeks away,

808
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:59,206
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew
return to the US

809
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:03,794
after a world tour that saw them visit
10 fighters in 10 different countries.

810
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:06,505
They stopped in Philadelphia today
to check in on renowned trainer,

811
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:07,715
Frank Campana,

812
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,551
and top contender, Marco Santos.

813
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:13,054
You gotta relax and stay calm in there.

814
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,014
The cage is your home.

815
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,515
You set the pace.

816
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,267
You set the rhythm.

817
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,353
Feel the Beethoven.

818
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:24,148
Be smarter than him, more patient.
Wait for him to make a mistake.

819
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,068
And when he does, that's your moment.

820
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,903
I see it. I see it. I see it.

821
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,323
No, he did not tap you!

822
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,160
Physics teacher!
That's the best in the business, son.

823
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,580
You can do this, Son!

824
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:42,416
Smoother. There's more in you!
You got more in you!

825
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:43,584
We're not done yet!

826
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:46,504
He's beating you! He's beating you!

827
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,548
You better push harder, Marco!
Brendan's running away!

828
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,596
And the winner by tap out

829
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:58,516
"Irish" Brendan Conlon.

830
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:08,109
"...to each and every man in turn
but mirrors back his own mysterious self.

831
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:13,197
"Great pains, small gains
for those who ask the world to solve them.

832
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,825
"It cannot solve itself."

833
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,219
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

834
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,638
- You wanna grab a bite?
- No. I'm gonna head home.

835
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,474
I gotta call the boys and break the news.

836
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:44,228
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay.

837
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:54,488
Coach!

838
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:02,371
Hey, I know this is not
a really great time,

839
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:05,624
and it's too bad about Marco.

840
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:10,046
But how about me?

841
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,673
Are you talking about Sparta?

842
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,342
Yeah.

843
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:17,011
Brendan, you've got a better shot
at starting a boy band.

844
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,095
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

845
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,982
It's a Grand Prix tournament.

846
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:34,820
Which means anything could happen.
You know that as well as I do.

847
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,405
Yeah.

848
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,242
Come on. They'd have to kill me
to get me out of the cage.

849
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,162
That's what I'm afraid of.

850
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,747
Frank, I need this.

851
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:48,793
You're real tight with these guys.
You could call them.

852
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:52,713
You're the guy. They trust you.

853
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,719
Brendan.

854
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:00,763
You realize
what you're asking me to do here?

855
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,348
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

856
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,559
We go down to AC,
you get tapped out in five seconds.

857
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:07,436
How does that benefit either one of us?

858
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,731
- It's not gonna happen.
- Not gonna happen?

859
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,775
Wish I had a nickel
for every time somebody told me that.

860
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,069
It's not gonna happen.

861
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,002
I'll make a call.

862
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:42,138
I love my coach!

863
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,983
Yeah, they're good. The girls are good.
They're good.

864
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,152
Yeah, he should.

865
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,779
I mean, you've been spending
so much time with Brendan these days,

866
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:01,907
it's like you're part of the family
or something.

867
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:07,621
Yeah, he's right here. It's your boyfriend.

868
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,292
Frank. Hey, man.

869
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,634
That's unbelievable.

870
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:25,723
Wow! Wow, Frank, I can't thank you enough.
l don't know what to say.

871
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,477
All right, listen, I gotta
call you back, okay?

872
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,360
All right. Bye.

873
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,238
I'm in.

874
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,617
- I'm going.
- Really?

875
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:49,246
That's your decision? You decided?

876
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,500
'Cause I really enjoyed the conversation
we just had

877
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:56,587
about making that decision together.

878
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:05,054
You told me you were gonna fight guys
that watched too much UFC.

879
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,348
I saw the Koba dude on the television,

880
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,350
and he's the guy they're watching.

881
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,392
It's a lot of money, Tess.

882
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,978
I don't give a shit about the money,
Brendan. I told you that.

883
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,232
We're gonna end up
cashing in your life insurance policy

884
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,775
before we pick up that prize money.

885
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,694
You don't think I can do it, right?

886
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:22,780
I think you could get killed.

887
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,869
- I'm not gonna get killed.
- You're not gonna get killed,

888
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,371
but you promised me
you're not gonna get hurt.

889
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,040
You're not gonna end up in the hospital.
You're not gonna end up paralyzed.

890
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:35,668
We have no prize money, we have no house.

891
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,796
- We have payments for hospital bills.
- Tess! Listen, I'll promise you this.

892
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,384
If I don't try in three weeks,
they're gonna take the house.

893
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,012
How's that for a promise?

894
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,894
So, I'm gonna go, okay?

895
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:57,231
But I'd really love it
if you'd be with me on this.

896
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,740
I'm not gonna watch you fight again,
I'm not.

897
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:09,243
I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.

898
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:42,609
Fourth of July weekend doesn't
officially get started until tomorrow,

899
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:45,154
but fight fans are already descending
on Atlantic City

900
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:49,074
for the Super Bowl
of mixed martial arts, Sparta!

901
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,952
We've got the dancing girls,
we've got the paparazzi,

902
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:53,454
we've got the red carpet!

903
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:57,041
And here comes J.J. Riley,
the man who started it all.

904
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,960
J.J., you've made a fortune
with your hedge funds.

905
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,754
You turned your back on Wall Street

906
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,173
and dedicated your life
to making Sparta happen.

907
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:07,509
Tell us why this tournament
is so important to you?

908
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,719
Growing up, we all wanted to know

909
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,013
who the toughest kid
in the neighborhood was, right?

910
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,931
I wanna know
who the toughest man on the planet is.

911
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,725
And that's why I put this thing together.

912
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:17,603
That's what all these people are
here to see, come Saturday night.

913
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,022
- That's what we're gonna find out.
- Thank you, J.J.

914
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:24,818
And here's something fans never thought
they'd see. Koba is here.

915
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:28,322
The legend arriving to fight on US soil
for the very first time.

916
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,406
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

917
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:32,451
Olympic gold medalist in wrestling,
world Sambo champion,

918
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,329
undefeated in his mixed
martial arts career.

919
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,499
Nobody's survived a round
with the Russian in five years.

920
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,085
He is the greatest fighter...

921
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,889
l mean, you've seen our logos.

922
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,225
No, yeah, I've seen your stuff.
it looks good.

923
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,851
I mean, is he fighting after Sparta?

924
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:00,020
I mean, we're trying to find
some info on him.

925
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:01,605
No, I'm not sure.

926
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,681
Hey, where'd you go? Where'd you go?

927
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,475
You can't leave me like that.
They want to talk to you, not me.

928
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:39,685
- Frank Campana?
- Yeah.

929
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,478
Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

930
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:43,355
- Julia, how are you?
- Brendan Conlon?

931
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,274
- Yeah, hi. Hey.
- Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

932
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,567
- Right, hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

933
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:47,860
A few things I want to let you guys know.

934
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,863
- Press conference will start in 20 minutes.
- Okay.

935
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,115
Brendan, you're gonna be sitting up
on the stage.

936
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,491
Tommy!

937
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,702
Hey, Tommy! Where you going?

938
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,704
Can we stand with J.J.?

939
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:01,373
"Hearing the tremendous rush
of the sea-crashing boat,

940
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:05,419
"the whale wheeled round
to present his blank forehead at bay.

941
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:09,756
"But in that evolution, catching sight
of the nearing black hull of the ship,

942
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:13,594
"seemingly seeing in it
the source of all his persecutions,

943
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:17,806
"bethinking it,
it may be a larger and nobler foe.

944
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:21,518
"Of a sudden,
he bore down upon its advancing prow,

945
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:25,522
"smiting his jaws
amid fiery showers of foam.

946
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:29,067
"Ahab staggered,
his hand smote his forehead.

947
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,903
"'I grow blind..."'.

948
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,738
Now, the only person missing
from the event

949
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,324
was dark horse entry, Tommy Riordan.

950
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:39,328
Recent revelations that Riordan
was not only a United States Marine,

951
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:43,290
but a hero in the Iraq War,
has cast an even wider spotlight

952
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,959
on a fighter
who seems to have come out of nowhere.

953
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,129
Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's
Web testimony to Riordan,

954
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:51,673
who saved his life earlier
this year in Iraq,

955
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,718
is now spreading like wildfire
throughout the media.

956
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:55,928
Tommy!

957
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,513
And the bridge just crumbled.

958
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:00,349
Tommy, come here.
Come on. You got to see this.

959
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:05,187
The amtrac was upside down
and water was coming in from everywhere.

960
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:09,316
And the water pressure was too much.
We couldn't get the back hatch open.

961
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,568
We were all drowning, man.

962
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,196
It was a death trap.

963
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:16,031
I couldn't have had more
than another minute.

964
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:20,077
Then suddenly,
the back ramp gets ripped off.

965
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,829
There he was.

966
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,793
And before I could get out and thank him,
he was gone.

967
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:30,754
- He just vanished like a ghost.
- Tommy?

968
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,091
- Tommy, did you... Where you going?
- Taking a walk.

969
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,635
Tommy!

970
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,930
I really just wanted to say thank you.

971
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:43,225
You saved my life, brother.

972
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:48,730
And anyone seeing this at Sparta,
anybody out in Pittsburgh,

973
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,693
you reach out to Tommy Riordan
and tell him Mark said, "Thank you."

974
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:55,696
Footage taken from a helmet cam
on the ground in Iraq

975
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,156
captured the heroic incident.

976
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,533
Hello?

977
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,118
Brendan?

978
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,620
Been looking all over for you.

979
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:49,207
How's it going?

980
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,001
It's going.

981
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:56,256
I was thinking we should go grab a coffee.

982
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,677
I don't drink coffee, man.
What do you want?

983
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,222
You don't wanna go sit down somewhere?

984
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:08,935
I'm good right here.

985
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,147
Okay.

986
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:21,698
Shit, Tommy, how was I supposed to know
l was never gonna see you guys again?

987
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:23,158
Yeah, well, you were briefed.

988
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:26,495
You had the information.

989
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:31,708
You chose the old man and the girl.

990
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:33,835
She wasn't just some girl.

991
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,215
I married her.

992
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,053
She's my wife.

993
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,305
See?

994
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,808
That's Tess.

995
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,268
That's Emily and Rosie.

996
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,479
They're your nieces, Tommy.

997
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,189
I don't know them.

998
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:58,110
I know you don't know them.
Of course you don't know them.

999
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:01,738
So why am I looking at pictures
of people I don't know?

1000
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,825
'Cause that's my family.

1001
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:08,829
And who are you exactly?

1002
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,252
I'm your brother, man.

1003
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:19,965
You were in the Corps?

1004
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:21,925
What?

1005
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:25,262
- I said I didn't know you were in the Corps.
- I wasn't in the Corps.

1006
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,682
Then you ain't no brother to me.

1007
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,268
My brother was in the Corps.

1008
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,520
Jesus, Tommy. Tommy.

1009
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:37,065
I was a 1 6-year-old kid.
What the hell did I know?

1010
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,567
I don't know what you know.

1011
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,277
Why don't you go ask your girlfriend
about it?

1012
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:41,945
She's my wife, Tommy.

1013
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:45,323
So, that's it? I stay with Tess,
l never get to see you guys again?

1014
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,784
Not a single phone call? Nothing?

1015
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,788
God, man, I don't understand this.

1016
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:53,957
What? You...

1017
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:57,711
So, you won't forgive me,
but you forgave Pop?

1018
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:04,050
No, he's just some old vet that I train
with, you know? He means nothing to me.

1019
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:08,472
And what I hear,
he means nothing to you, either.

1020
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:13,185
You got balls talking about forgiveness.

1021
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,020
That has nothing to do with forgiveness.

1022
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,898
I got children, man.
l got a family to protect.

1023
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,983
Everything I do is for them.

1024
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:22,527
I forgave Pop.

1025
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,446
Just like I forgave you and Mom.

1026
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,330
You forgave us?

1027
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,541
Yeah.

1028
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,628
Well, I'm not surprised
you made the tournament, Brendan.

1029
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,797
You got some stones, man.

1030
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,466
I fell in love.
What the hell was I supposed to do?

1031
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,260
You were supposed to stick to the plan.
You were supposed to come with us.

1032
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:50,847
Mom needed you, I needed you.
You're my big brother. You bailed on me.

1033
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:54,768
Hey, you know, I'm glad you stayed.
Everything worked out for you.

1034
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:55,894
God.

1035
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:59,606
You leave, you get the opposite. Okay?

1036
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,359
You leave, you get to bury people.

1037
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:05,362
You're not the only one
that suffered, Tommy.

1038
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,574
I didn't even know she was sick.

1039
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:14,704
I never even got the chance to say goodbye
to my own mother.

1040
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:21,253
You had no right to keep that from me.
That was not your decision to make!

1041
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,715
You know what?

1042
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,219
You walk around
with your pictures of your wife,

1043
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:31,596
and you're all, "l forgive you.

1044
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,224
"l forgive Pop.

1045
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:36,476
"l forgive everyone."

1046
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:38,061
Brendan, you know,

1047
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,565
you're full of shit.

1048
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:50,365
Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?

1049
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:12,888
You realize you're supposed to seek
my wise counsel

1050
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,098
while school's actually in session, right?

1051
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:17,100
- Yes, Principal Z.
- Tell him.

1052
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,477
Okay, we wanna use the auditorium
this weekend

1053
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,521
to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

1054
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,273
What do you say?

1055
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:25,025
So, you want to use the auditorium

1056
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:28,737
to watch a suspended teacher engage
in the activity that he was suspended for?

1057
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,071
- Right.
- Am I hearing this correct?

1058
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,032
Right. Okay, we thought you would say that,

1059
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:33,950
so it could turn into a fundraiser,
you know?

1060
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:36,077
You know,
l think you need to talk to your parents,

1061
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,288
because you guys might need
to be in summer school.

1062
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:39,789
- Everybody wants this.
- Come on, Mr. Zito.

1063
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:41,374
We've been telling everybody
about it already.

1064
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:42,459
- Exactly.
- And the gym's the only place

1065
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,836
- that's big enough to fit everyone.
- Look, it's never gonna happen.

1066
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:47,422
- What if we get a petition signed?
- We'll get the whole school to sign it.

1067
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,382
- The power of democracy.
- What are they gonna do about that?

1068
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:50,425
Mr. Z, please?

1069
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:53,553
Look, look, you guys. I appreciate the fact
that you love your teacher, I really do,

1070
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:56,681
but there is nothing I can do for you.

1071
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:34,302
The roof is about to blow clean off
Boardwalk Hall Arena.

1072
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:39,307
It might be Fourth of July weekend,
but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans.

1073
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:43,603
This is Atlantic City.
This is the War on the Shore,

1074
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:46,606
and this is
what everyone's been waiting for.

1075
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:51,528
Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet
duking it out over a 24-hour period

1076
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:55,031
for the largest purse
in mixed martial arts history.

1077
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:58,118
In the town everyone knows
from the game of Monopoly,

1078
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:01,246
we got ourselves a winner-take-all affair.

1079
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:06,626
Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice,
and take a ride on the Reading.

1080
01:15:06,711 --> 01:15:09,838
Sparta is here!

1081
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:11,923
Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen,

1082
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,759
along with bestselling fight author,
Sam Sheridan.

1083
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:17,929
Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta,

1084
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,889
he wanted to create, quite simply,

1085
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:23,893
the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle
in history.

1086
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:27,188
$5 million, Bryan. $5 million.

1087
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,691
J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is

1088
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:33,194
and put up the biggest purse
the sport has ever seen.

1089
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:35,071
It's unprecedented, Sam.

1090
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:39,492
As is the hoopla surrounding
one Tommy Riordan, the war hero,

1091
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:41,995
who has become an overnight sensation

1092
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,080
and captured the imagination
and attention...

1093
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,919
Jujitsu black belt Francisco Barbosa,

1094
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:53,256
who has a 19 to four record
in his mixed martial arts' career.

1095
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:56,092
Our rules of the cage are brought to you
by Tapout.

1096
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,806
- Five minutes, Paddy.
- Okay.

1097
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:07,437
It looks as though the moment of truth
has arrived,

1098
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:10,231
- because here comes Tommy Riordan.
- Wow!

1099
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,525
Tommy Riordan's
captured the media's attention,

1100
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,569
but the question still remains.

1101
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:16,029
Who is this guy?

1102
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,572
And more importantly,

1103
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:20,575
can he compete in this talent pool?
Can he win?

1104
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:22,410
I wish I knew. I wish I knew who he was.

1105
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:26,206
And I say the fact that I don't know
is very strange.

1106
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,458
In an Internet age
where there are no secrets,

1107
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,418
this guy's a complete mystery.

1108
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,462
I can't find out anything about him.

1109
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:35,632
Tommy Riordan is officially Google-proof.

1110
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,303
Get your hands off me.

1111
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,639
Okay, let's go.

1112
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:44,015
You gotta love this guy, Sam.

1113
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,976
No walk-out music,
no sponsors, no interviews.

1114
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:48,937
He skipped the press conference,

1115
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,397
wouldn't have his picture taken
for the program.

1116
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,233
He's breaking every rule.

1117
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,569
The only reason, really,
that Tommy Riordan is in this tournament

1118
01:16:56,654 --> 01:17:01,157
is an MMA video making the rounds of him
beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.

1119
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:03,952
But the reason
that a lot of his fans are in the stands

1120
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,620
is because of another video.

1121
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,373
It's even more stunning
than the Mad Dog Grimes video.

1122
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,208
This guy...
Let me describe it to you, folks,

1123
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,585
for the few that haven't seen it,
and I don't know anybody who hasn't,

1124
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:16,214
but Tommy Riordan ripped the door
off a tank

1125
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,259
in the heat of battle,
saving lives in the process,

1126
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,302
and then walked away
without claiming a medal.

1127
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:22,720
- Listen...
- He ripped the door off a tank.

1128
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,681
Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero.

1129
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:28,101
I'm not taking anything away from the guy,
he's a very, very tough guy,

1130
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:30,854
- but the tank don't hit back, you know.
- Sam...

1131
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:33,356
We've seen YouTube sensations fail
on a big stage before.

1132
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,900
Sam, he ripped the door off a tank!

1133
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:41,489
Tommy Riordan,
he has definitely got his hands full

1134
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,075
in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa.

1135
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,618
- Francisco Barbosa...
- He's nothing to scoff at.

1136
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:47,412
Yeah, he's the octopus. He's the real deal.

1137
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:51,666
He's a very, very tough guy,
a very high-caliber fighter.

1138
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,418
Now, Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere,

1139
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,879
and I'd imagine he's gonna disappear
just as quickly.

1140
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:56,963
It's a great story,

1141
01:17:57,047 --> 01:18:00,091
but I think your boy
is gonna be exposed here

1142
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:01,634
- as a YouTube sensation.
- Well, well,

1143
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:04,846
a lot of fans here in Boardwalk Hall
hope you're wrong, Sam.

1144
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,098
All right, gentlemen,
you've been given your instructions.

1145
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,725
I expect a clean fight.

1146
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,143
Obey my command at all times,

1147
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:11,519
defend yourselves at all times.

1148
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,396
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1149
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:18,026
Tommy, cut off the corners,
feel this guy out,

1150
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,569
just like we know. Just like we know.

1151
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:22,530
We're about to get the big answer
to the big question.

1152
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:24,824
Ls Tommy Riordan for real?

1153
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:27,118
- Gentlemen, you ready?
- They are both game fighters.

1154
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:28,953
- And here we go.
- You ready?

1155
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,163
Let's go to war!

1156
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,831
Keep your focus, Tom.

1157
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,666
And here we go. We're gonna see this.

1158
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,126
Barbosa's gonna be looking for a takedown.

1159
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:37,253
He's definitely looking
for a takedown here.

1160
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:45,094
Barbosa is down!
Barbosa has been knocked out!

1161
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:48,348
Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real.

1162
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:52,018
And now he's walking out of the cage.
He's leaving the cage.

1163
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:53,645
Hey, Tommy!

1164
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,813
There goes another rule, out the window!

1165
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:57,941
Where you going?

1166
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,069
Francisco Barbosa is out cold,

1167
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,821
and he is out of this tournament, Bryan.

1168
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,741
- A huge left hook, launching...
- Good. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

1169
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:09,702
- ...Tommy Riordan into the second round.
- One, two. Good, good. One, two, three.

1170
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,330
Good. Two, three.

1171
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,082
Good. Good, good, good.

1172
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:17,043
- Good. Come on. Good. One, two.
- Tommy Riordan is the real deal.

1173
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:21,214
- Showtime.
- All right. Come on, give me eight.

1174
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,885
Yes! That's my boy.

1175
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:10,513
Let's go, move your head around.

1176
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,479
You ready?

1177
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,693
Look at me.

1178
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,282
You can do this.

1179
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,665
I wanna hear you say it.

1180
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:44,297
I can do this.

1181
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:46,799
Let's go do this.

1182
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,110
Yeah.

1183
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:07,737
J.J. Riley only had 48 hours,
less than 48 hours, to fill the spot.

1184
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,698
And basically, he had to go on the road
to Frank Campana.

1185
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,867
Well, then he chose Brendan Conlon,

1186
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,702
which is really something
l don't understand.

1187
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,746
I just... I'm shocked.

1188
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:23,878
Hey, Brendan. Brendan, go get him.

1189
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:28,257
Go. Good luck.

1190
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:31,010
Let's go, Brendan.

1191
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,721
You go get him, Son!

1192
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,890
You know, I can understand
coming out to no music,

1193
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:39,519
but why in the world would you choose
classical music as your entrance?

1194
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:42,397
This is Beethoven.
This is Ode to Joy, Bryan.

1195
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:44,440
My apologies, Mr. Renaissance Man.

1196
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,652
Go get him, Son.

1197
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:51,322
If you wanna talk about Renaissance men,
you gotta talk about Frank Campana.

1198
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:54,450
Very unorthodox trainer,
but one of the best trainers in the game,

1199
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:58,788
and he's well known for using classical
music to teach his fighters to remain calm,

1200
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:02,291
to remain patient,
and to remain composed under pressure.

1201
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:06,003
You know, I'll tell you, classical music
is about as fitting to this setting

1202
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,798
as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament.

1203
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:10,299
- Come on.
- In fact, let me show you something.

1204
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:11,384
Right here. Let me tell you...

1205
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:12,885
- What?
- You see that, right there?

1206
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:16,806
That, right there...
That, my friend, is Brendan Conlon.

1207
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:20,768
Okay? Brendan Conlon's about
to be dropped into a shark tank.

1208
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:22,103
He's a feeder fish.

1209
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,688
Come on, give the guy a break.

1210
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,107
You know, the guy...
At least we've seen him fight.

1211
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,651
I mean, he's fought real guys.
He's been in the UFC.

1212
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,695
- We remember him from that.
- I remember him, too.

1213
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,822
I remember him being very unmemorable.

1214
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:56,137
Midnight Le getting ready
to climb into the cage and go to work.

1215
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:57,263
When the brackets were announced,

1216
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:59,182
he thought he'd be going up
against Marco Santos.

1217
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:02,226
He's got to be thrilled to be seeing
Brendan Conlon across from him.

1218
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,395
Hey! You asked for it.

1219
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:07,773
Brendan retired from fighting
some years ago.

1220
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,443
He's actually
a high school physics teacher now,

1221
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:13,446
and Midnight had some fun with that
at the press conference yesterday.

1222
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:16,199
Well, he said he was going to give
the teacher a serious lesson,

1223
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:19,619
and that getting killed was no way
to spend a summer vacation.

1224
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:23,372
Midnight is known for talking trash,
he's also known for backing it up.

1225
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:25,416
No question, Bryan.
He's in a lot of trouble here.

1226
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:29,128
- Midnight Le is an agent of destruction.
- Gentlemen.

1227
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,132
Go get him.

1228
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:37,887
All right, guys,
you've been given your instructions.

1229
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,388
I expect a clean fight.

1230
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:42,975
Obey my commands at all times.
Defend yourselves at all times.

1231
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,228
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1232
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:48,564
Go have some fun, baby.

1233
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,070
Gentlemen, you ready?

1234
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:57,740
You ready? Let's go to war!

1235
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:05,081
Work your kicks!

1236
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,627
Come on, Brendan, come on.

1237
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,587
Move! You gotta move, you gotta move.

1238
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:14,173
Let it out! Come on, move!

1239
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,054
Stay away from the legs! Circle!

1240
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,556
In and out!

1241
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:29,438
Get off the fence!

1242
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:32,942
Get through this. Sprawl down!

1243
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:36,487
Get off the fence! Get off the fence!

1244
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:39,365
There he goes!

1245
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:40,783
Come on, Brendan. Get out of there!

1246
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,702
Come on!

1247
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,662
Get up!

1248
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:48,291
- Come on! Come on!
- Watch the back of the head!

1249
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,543
- Relax, you're okay. You're okay!
- Midnight is all over Brendan.

1250
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:53,129
Well, this can't last much longer.
This won't last much longer.

1251
01:24:53,213 --> 01:24:55,631
The teacher just has no answers.

1252
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:57,717
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1253
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,512
- And now, he's got the hooks in.
- The hooks are in.

1254
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,639
- Brendan in very big trouble.
- The end is close.

1255
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,641
Can Brendan make the end of the round?

1256
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,560
Well, he's got the choke.

1257
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,228
- He's got 20 seconds left in the round...
- Come on.

1258
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:12,398
And Conlon's face is turning purple.
This looks like it's over.

1259
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,775
Get up! Find his legs!

1260
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,736
Hips! Hip down!

1261
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,196
Hip down! Get your weight down!

1262
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:20,740
Get your weight down!

1263
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,284
Well, Midnight is squeezing
with all his might. He's got it very deep.

1264
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,953
- Ten seconds! Don't you tap!
- Ten seconds, Bryan, 1 0 seconds.

1265
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:28,205
Don't tap! Brendan, don't you tap!

1266
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:29,749
Hold on, Brendan.

1267
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,334
Conlon doing his best to hang on,

1268
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:33,377
'cause his whole world's about to go
from day to night.

1269
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:35,713
Don't you tap! Don't you tap, Brendan!

1270
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:41,010
I cannot believe that, Sam!

1271
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:43,262
I thought for sure this guy
was going to sleep.

1272
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:47,892
Midnight can't believe
it either, by the way.

1273
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:50,394
Jesus.

1274
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:55,816
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1275
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:59,779
You should've had him in the first round.

1276
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:04,033
Beautiful. Beautiful.
He doesn't know what hit him.

1277
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:05,951
He doesn't know what hit him. Breathe.

1278
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:07,703
Deep breaths. Come on now.

1279
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:10,164
Small sip, small sip. Small sip.

1280
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:12,583
Deep breath, deep breath.
l want you to do something.

1281
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,378
I want you to get him to pull, okay?

1282
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:18,214
When he pulls, I want you to hit him a bit
and I want you to shoot on him.

1283
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:21,384
I'd love to be a fly on the wall,
listening to Frank Campana right now

1284
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:22,510
and hear what he's saying in there.

1285
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,261
In and out. In and out. In and out.

1286
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:27,348
And I want you to trade punches with him, all right?
You're doing beautiful.

1287
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:30,309
Let's go, seconds out!

1288
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:31,602
Knock him out. Knock him out.
Knock him out.

1289
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:32,812
This round, knock him out.

1290
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,980
- Let's do it.
- He doesn't deserve to be here.

1291
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:37,024
Beautiful. Breathe.

1292
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:38,401
Let's go!

1293
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:44,115
And here we go. The teacher
answering the bell for round two.

1294
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:45,282
Nice and easy!

1295
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,327
Set the pace! Set the pace, Brendan!

1296
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:50,413
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1297
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:09,014
Circle around! Circle around!

1298
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:10,725
Nice and easy!

1299
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,269
Good, good!

1300
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:15,354
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1301
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:22,027
Get out of there! Hitch him! Hitch him!
Hitch him!

1302
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,823
Get out of there! Get out of there!
Get out of there! Come on!

1303
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:29,285
Do something.

1304
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:33,205
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1305
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:34,999
Shoot on him!

1306
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:38,836
Yes!

1307
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,005
Conlon shoots on Midnight Le
and gets him down.

1308
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,590
Midnight is trying to get to his...

1309
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,634
- Scissors takedown.
- A beautiful scissors takedown.

1310
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:47,595
- Really nice.
- Conlon showing signs of life

1311
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,472
and not backing down.

1312
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:50,765
Knees, knees!

1313
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:55,394
Good!

1314
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:57,605
Take his arm! Good!

1315
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:01,567
- He's got a kimura lock!
- He's got a very good kimura.

1316
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:04,987
Turn your hips in! In!

1317
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:08,032
Up! Stay with him. Turn your hips in!

1318
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,911
Hips up! Turn your hips in!

1319
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:13,287
Turn your hips in!

1320
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:15,998
You got it, Brendan.
Your round. You got it!

1321
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,250
Turn your hips up and in!

1322
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:20,419
Hips up! Very good!

1323
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,087
He's in a lot of trouble.

1324
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:24,006
That's it! Come on! Come on!

1325
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:27,051
- Wow! He's got it very, very deep.
- Midnight is in a very, very bad position.

1326
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:28,219
Midnight is in big trouble.

1327
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:31,263
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1328
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:32,973
Brendan Conlon is going
to finish it right here!

1329
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:34,892
Brendan Conlon has got
him in a very, very dangerous position

1330
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,644
- and Midnight is in big trouble.
- Midnight...

1331
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,187
I don't think Midnight has anywhere to go.

1332
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:40,356
You got it! You got it!

1333
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:43,943
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1334
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:47,571
And this isn't... This isn't happening!

1335
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:49,532
- This can't happen.
- it just did, Bryan.

1336
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:50,783
He tapped!

1337
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,910
Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!

1338
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,454
- I can't believe that.
- Oh, my goodness!

1339
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:58,249
You got him! Way to go, Brendan!

1340
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:04,588
Yeah! Yeah! He tapped him out.

1341
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:06,215
Honey, he tapped him out!

1342
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:09,426
He did it! He did it! He did it! He did it!

1343
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:12,137
Way to go, Brendan! Way to go! Yeah!

1344
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,015
This is what's so great
about mixed martial arts.

1345
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,851
There's so many ways to lose.

1346
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:21,272
One tiny miscalculation,
anyone can win at anytime.

1347
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,774
Which is probably why Frank Campana's
embracing his man.

1348
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:28,654
And I honestly don't think either
one of them can believe what just happened.

1349
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:31,198
Great show of sportsmanship here
from the teacher.

1350
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:33,951
Well, that's a hallmark
of Frank Campana's philosophy,

1351
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,661
something all his fighters buy into,

1352
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:37,705
and, obviously, none more so than Brendan.

1353
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,498
And Midnight Le is shocked.

1354
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,584
He thought he'd get a free pass
into the second round,

1355
01:29:41,668 --> 01:29:42,960
but, instead, he's going home.

1356
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:47,256
Dominated the fight the entire way, but
he falls prey to a very technical finish.

1357
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,383
A very technical finish,
but that's a fluke.

1358
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,427
- I don't care what anybody says.
That is a... - I don't know.

1359
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:54,346
You can call it a fluke, but I'm gonna
call it a guy maintaining composure

1360
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:56,265
and waiting for his opportunity.

1361
01:29:57,267 --> 01:30:00,519
Conlon beats Midnight! Unbelievable!

1362
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:04,148
I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.

1363
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:28,255
Yes!

1364
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:31,133
Okay.

1365
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:45,230
We're down to eight fighters,
and soon to be seven,

1366
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:48,108
as Koba prepares to go to work
for the second time tonight.

1367
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:54,740
- Right hand.
- Huge right hand.

1368
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:56,200
- Huge right hand.
- Oh, my goodness.

1369
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:58,619
Oh, my God! This is over.

1370
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,621
Once again, Koba does not break a sweat.

1371
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:03,582
You got to be kidding me. I'm afraid
he might have broken something else.

1372
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:05,042
That's certainly possible.

1373
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:07,586
Koba moving on to tomorrow night.

1374
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:09,672
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

1375
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:13,425
Mad Dog fighting like a man possessed.

1376
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,260
Like a man with something to prove,

1377
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:19,348
reminding everyone why he is a serious
contender to win this whole contest.

1378
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:23,686
He wanted to send a message to Tommy
Riordan, and there it is, right there.

1379
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,438
Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon.

1380
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:28,941
The teacher miraculously
passed his first test,

1381
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,526
but now he's got to face The Dane.

1382
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:33,153
Brendan! You can do it.

1383
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:38,742
Halfway through round three, now,
and the beating continues.

1384
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:42,871
I honestly don't know how Brendan Conlon
can take this kind of punishment.

1385
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,873
He has been battered without mercy

1386
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,417
- in both of his fights today.
- Relax! You're okay!

1387
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,168
He's still standing, Bryan.

1388
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:51,338
Beethoven!

1389
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:53,007
No! No, no, no!

1390
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:56,301
Good, take him down!

1391
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,304
Look at this, he's taking The Dane down!

1392
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:00,431
Hold on to him.

1393
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:03,142
He's looking for that arm.
He's looking for the armbar.

1394
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,060
- He's got an armbar.
- He's got that armbar.

1395
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:06,937
He's looking to be boss of it, once again.

1396
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:08,564
Tap, tap, tap! Come on, tap, tap, tap!

1397
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:11,900
Palms flat! Palms flat! Thumbs up!

1398
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:14,069
He's got that arm, Sam!

1399
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:16,655
- Break, break, break, break!
- Yes!

1400
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:17,781
Are you kidding me?

1401
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:19,658
Yes!

1402
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:22,119
Do it once, it's a fluke.
Do it twice, and it's something else.

1403
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:25,497
Pull the bandwagon over,
l think I am hopping on.

1404
01:32:25,832 --> 01:32:27,166
I think I'm a believer.

1405
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:30,085
You did it! Way to go, Brendan!

1406
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:31,795
- I'm doing this!
- Okay.

1407
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,088
- I'm doing it!
- Okay.

1408
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:34,381
Okay, Son.

1409
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:38,052
The crowd catching fire
for the hero Tommy Riordan.

1410
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:41,346
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1411
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:44,058
He doesn't seem to want
anything to do with all this adulation.

1412
01:32:44,142 --> 01:32:45,851
He's just here to fight.

1413
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:48,395
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1414
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,938
Gentlemen, you ready?

1415
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,024
Are you ready?

1416
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:54,318
- Let's go to war!
- Right at him! Right at him! Right at him!

1417
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:57,529
Well, here he comes again like a buzz saw!

1418
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:03,368
- Yeah.
- He is all over Diego Santana.

1419
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:08,624
He's swarming all over him,
and now he's beating on him without mercy!

1420
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:09,750
Oh, my goodness!

1421
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:21,428
There he goes again,
storming out of the cage!

1422
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:24,348
Tommy Riordan marching off
through the crowd

1423
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:28,102
and straight into the final four,
ladies and gentlemen.

1424
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:30,813
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1425
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:59,716
- So where is he?
- Yeah. Mr. Conlon.

1426
01:34:00,426 --> 01:34:02,052
Make a right at that white sign...

1427
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:14,356
Hey! Can't sleep, huh?

1428
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:24,867
I know that that other thing is

1429
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,913
bothering the hell out of you.

1430
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:33,500
I'm proud of you, Tommy.

1431
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:37,087
What you did for that kid in the tank,

1432
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:39,882
that was really something.

1433
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:45,137
How about deserting my unit?

1434
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,891
Ls that really something, too?

1435
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,270
Yeah.

1436
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:58,066
I was on my way out of the country
when I came across those guys.

1437
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:00,694
What was I supposed to do?
Let them drown?

1438
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:01,904
No.

1439
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:07,492
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

1440
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:11,705
I took off.

1441
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:17,461
That's why you go by Riordan.

1442
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:21,924
That's why they can't
find your service records.

1443
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:28,013
What the hell happened over there, Tommy?

1444
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:31,058
That is none of your business, man.

1445
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:33,977
Come on, kiddo. You know, I've been there.

1446
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:36,521
I've done it, I've seen it.

1447
01:35:36,606 --> 01:35:38,190
You can trust me. I understand.

1448
01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:41,318
Will you spare me the
compassionate father routine, Pop?

1449
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:44,446
The suit don't fit.

1450
01:35:45,281 --> 01:35:46,448
Tommy.

1451
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:49,409
I'm really trying here.

1452
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:52,996
- You're trying?
- Yeah, really. I'm trying.

1453
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:54,248
Now?

1454
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:59,253
Where were you when it mattered?

1455
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:04,299
I needed this guy back when I was a kid.
l don't need you now.

1456
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:08,470
You know, it's too late now.
Everything's already happened.

1457
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,557
You and Brendan
don't seem to understand that.

1458
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:16,186
Let me explain something to you, okay?

1459
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:19,564
The only thing that I have in common
with Brendan Conlon

1460
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,525
is that the pair of us,

1461
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:25,404
we have absolutely no use for you.

1462
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:31,326
Look at you.

1463
01:36:32,578 --> 01:36:35,122
Yeah, I was right.

1464
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:37,916
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

1465
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,127
At least you had some balls then,
not like now,

1466
01:36:40,211 --> 01:36:44,381
tiptoeing around,
like some beggar with your cup out.

1467
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:49,386
Take it somewhere else.
In fact, you know what?

1468
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:50,512
Here's a cup.

1469
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:53,974
Why don't you take this and go get yourself
some more of your shitty tapes...

1470
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:55,934
- Don't do this, Tommy.
- ...and you go back to the room

1471
01:36:56,019 --> 01:36:57,686
- and you listen to some more...
- Don't do this.

1472
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:01,273
Fish stories that no one gives a shit about.
Now get out of here.

1473
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:05,360
Get the fuck out of here! Go on.

1474
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:46,193
God pity them!

1475
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:49,279
All shall perish except me!

1476
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:56,828
Bastards. Bastards!

1477
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:01,083
You bastards. You bastards!

1478
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:04,669
Stop the ship, you bastards!

1479
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:07,089
Ishmael. God pity them.

1480
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:11,218
Stop the ship. Please, stop the ship.

1481
01:38:13,429 --> 01:38:16,014
Stop the ship! Somebody.

1482
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:18,767
Ahab.

1483
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:21,937
You godless son of a bitch!

1484
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:23,897
You stop the ship!

1485
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:27,109
You godless son of a bitch!

1486
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:31,196
"'The whale! The ship!'
cried the cringing oarsmen.

1487
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,281
"'Oars! Oars! Slope downward..."'.

1488
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:34,574
Stop it.

1489
01:38:34,784 --> 01:38:37,327
"'O sea that ere it be for ever too late,

1490
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:40,831
"'Ahab may slide this last,
last time upon his mark!"'.

1491
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:44,042
Captain...

1492
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:47,170
Stop the...

1493
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:49,548
Captain, stop...

1494
01:38:49,632 --> 01:38:51,967
Stop the ship, Ahab.

1495
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:55,470
For the love of God.

1496
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:58,181
They're lost.

1497
01:38:59,225 --> 01:39:01,143
Stop it... The ship.

1498
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:06,356
Ahab...

1499
01:39:09,527 --> 01:39:11,153
You stop the...

1500
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:17,117
Oh, no.

1501
01:39:21,581 --> 01:39:23,623
- Come on, give me the Walkman.
- No.

1502
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,917
- No, no.
- Come on.

1503
01:39:26,002 --> 01:39:27,878
Come on, come on.
Come, give me the bottle.

1504
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:29,921
Come here, come here, come here.

1505
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:32,340
- Come on. Give me.
- No.

1506
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:43,977
Tommy.

1507
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,688
We're lost.

1508
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:50,192
We're lost, Tommy.

1509
01:39:51,861 --> 01:39:54,988
It's over. We'll never make it back.

1510
01:39:56,866 --> 01:39:59,576
- Stay down.
- We'll never make it back.

1511
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:11,755
I'm here.

1512
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:19,221
I always loved you.

1513
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:23,767
You know that, don't you, Tommy?

1514
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,353
I always loved you.

1515
01:40:27,897 --> 01:40:31,274
You and your brother. My two boys.

1516
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:50,085
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1517
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:07,227
Tommy Riordan coming down the tunnel
without his trainer.

1518
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:14,442
Once again, no walk-out music.

1519
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:20,115
I'd hardly say no music, Sam.

1520
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:28,164
Bryan, it sounds like V-J day
in Times Square.

1521
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:30,250
I've never seen anything like this.

1522
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:50,228
Tommy acknowledging his comrades
for the first time

1523
01:41:50,313 --> 01:41:52,480
and climbing into the cage.

1524
01:41:57,153 --> 01:41:59,404
Mad Dog Grimes has been
waiting for revenge

1525
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:02,198
ever since the day Tommy Riordan
walked into his gym in Pittsburgh

1526
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:04,117
and turned his life upside down.

1527
01:42:04,201 --> 01:42:07,912
It's been a very long and very miserable
few months for Mad Dog, to say the least.

1528
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:13,918
Grimes mocking Riordan by having
a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight,

1529
01:42:14,003 --> 01:42:17,297
and the Marines are really
letting Mad Dog have it.

1530
01:42:20,885 --> 01:42:22,344
All right, gentlemen.

1531
01:42:27,016 --> 01:42:28,558
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1532
01:42:28,643 --> 01:42:29,934
I expect a clean fight.

1533
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:32,937
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1534
01:42:33,022 --> 01:42:34,898
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1535
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:36,858
It's not gonna happen again.

1536
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:41,988
Mad Dog chomping at the bit here.
He can't wait to get a piece of Tommy.

1537
01:42:42,073 --> 01:42:43,490
He predicted an early knockout.

1538
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:46,284
He said he was gonna
take Tommy out with one punch.

1539
01:42:46,369 --> 01:42:48,912
And by the way, he said,
"They're gonna have to pull me off him."

1540
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:51,873
We'll see what Tommy has to say about that.

1541
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:54,876
Gentlemen, you ready?

1542
01:42:55,503 --> 01:42:56,711
You ready?

1543
01:42:58,631 --> 01:43:00,840
- Let's go to war!
- Here they go and they are off!

1544
01:43:02,385 --> 01:43:04,803
Tommy tackles him, and he's on top!

1545
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:06,554
He's raining bombs!

1546
01:43:06,889 --> 01:43:09,057
- Cover up!
- Come on, work it.

1547
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:11,768
- Raining bombs.
- Mad Dog is out.

1548
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:13,978
Mad Dog's in trouble. Please stop this.

1549
01:43:14,063 --> 01:43:15,563
Stop it! Stop the fight!

1550
01:43:17,566 --> 01:43:19,609
Break! Break! Break!

1551
01:43:22,363 --> 01:43:24,155
That's the fastest knockout I think
I've ever experienced!

1552
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:27,701
Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.
He is not moving.

1553
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:33,206
You do that to someone on the street,
they lock you up and throw away the key.

1554
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:34,874
Break out the yellow tape, Sam.

1555
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:37,711
This guy's walking away from the cage
like he's leaving a crime scene!

1556
01:43:37,795 --> 01:43:40,964
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1557
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:49,597
- Everybody through. Come on, move it out.
- Sparta!

1558
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:02,527
Yeah!

1559
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:06,030
Mr. C! Mr. C!

1560
01:44:06,115 --> 01:44:07,532
I'm on your side.

1561
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:18,126
Let's go.

1562
01:44:18,419 --> 01:44:21,254
- Principal Zito, there he is.
- Nice.

1563
01:44:25,301 --> 01:44:26,968
Let's go, Brendan.

1564
01:44:30,306 --> 01:44:33,933
Brendan Conlon came into this tournament
as 1,000-to-one underdog,

1565
01:44:34,018 --> 01:44:36,227
and now here he is in the final four.

1566
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:39,898
The crowd showing their appreciation.
He's getting quite the reception.

1567
01:44:39,982 --> 01:44:43,902
He's got a huge reception.
l mean, this guy shocked everybody.

1568
01:44:45,154 --> 01:44:47,113
Come on, come on. You all right?

1569
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:51,367
You've got a visitor.

1570
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:55,538
Second row, 1 0 o'clock.

1571
01:45:04,006 --> 01:45:05,256
You all right with that?

1572
01:45:10,179 --> 01:45:11,221
I love you.

1573
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:16,893
And here comes the great Russian, Koba.

1574
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:20,688
Koba is so intimidating
and his reputation is larger than life.

1575
01:45:20,773 --> 01:45:24,025
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

1576
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:32,784
I want you to look right at him
when he comes in here. Look right at him.

1577
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:35,578
All right? Don't take your eyes off him.

1578
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:05,108
I'm proud of you, brother.

1579
01:46:05,734 --> 01:46:07,443
This is your cage.

1580
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:20,665
Gentlemen.

1581
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:30,133
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1582
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:31,676
I expect a clean fight.

1583
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,512
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1584
01:46:34,597 --> 01:46:37,140
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1585
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:43,688
Should I be nervous for Brendan?
'Cause I am.

1586
01:46:43,772 --> 01:46:45,940
I wanna stop the fight
before it even gets going.

1587
01:46:46,025 --> 01:46:49,110
- Well, here we go.
- He's like a machine. Look at him.

1588
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,448
Gentlemen, you ready?

1589
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:55,658
You ready? Let's go to war!

1590
01:46:55,743 --> 01:46:57,243
Keep your hands up, Brendan. Hands up.

1591
01:46:57,328 --> 01:47:01,247
But now, the question is, how long
can Brendan Conlon stay alive?

1592
01:47:01,457 --> 01:47:02,624
Angle out of it!

1593
01:47:04,627 --> 01:47:06,127
Keep moving!

1594
01:47:07,713 --> 01:47:10,214
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1595
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:16,721
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Get away from him!

1596
01:47:16,805 --> 01:47:18,514
Hit him, babe! Hit him! Get in there!

1597
01:47:20,601 --> 01:47:22,644
- Crushing body shots.
- Relax, you're okay.

1598
01:47:22,728 --> 01:47:24,646
Conlon's down,
and Koba pounces and starts pounding!

1599
01:47:24,730 --> 01:47:26,105
Get up! Get up!

1600
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,149
He's just pounding on him
like a side of beef.

1601
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,776
Go, go, go. Get up!

1602
01:47:30,736 --> 01:47:31,778
He's getting his ass whooped.

1603
01:47:34,615 --> 01:47:36,074
And now he's got him in the air!

1604
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:37,825
Oh, God.

1605
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:40,161
Relax, tie up his arm! Tie him up!

1606
01:47:43,832 --> 01:47:46,167
I think Campana has to think
seriously about...

1607
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:48,586
- How much abuse can one man take?
- ...continuing another round of this.

1608
01:47:48,671 --> 01:47:49,796
Go to war!

1609
01:47:53,676 --> 01:47:57,345
Just relax! Relax! Relax! Off the fence!

1610
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:01,683
Brendan's going for a ride!

1611
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:04,352
That one shook the entire building!

1612
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:08,398
Man, he just threw him against the fence
like a rag doll.

1613
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:12,276
Get up! Get up! Come on!
Hold on! Turn it in! Turn in!

1614
01:48:12,361 --> 01:48:14,070
And now he's on top! Koba's on top,

1615
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:17,115
and he's finishing him, here. Look at this.
On the edge of blowing it.

1616
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,117
Get off the fence, Brendan!

1617
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:21,869
You wonder how Conlon can
take this kind of beating on his arms.

1618
01:48:21,954 --> 01:48:25,039
- His forearms and his hands.
- Drop that neck!

1619
01:48:25,124 --> 01:48:26,624
How much can one man take?

1620
01:48:27,543 --> 01:48:29,002
Break! Break! Break!

1621
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:33,506
Everybody has got to be
a little bit concerned

1622
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:36,342
about Brendan Conlon's bravery
getting him in trouble here.

1623
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:38,386
His bravery could get him killed, frankly.

1624
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:40,638
And by the way,
he's got nothing more to prove.

1625
01:48:40,723 --> 01:48:42,515
- He's lasted two rounds with Koba.
- That's true, that's true.

1626
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:44,726
And you wonder what's keeping this guy up.

1627
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:47,770
Sit down. Sit down.

1628
01:48:48,897 --> 01:48:50,523
Breathe. Breathe!

1629
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:53,359
Look at me. Look at me!

1630
01:48:53,444 --> 01:48:56,738
Wait up. Small sips. Hold it.
Hold it, small sips.

1631
01:48:59,783 --> 01:49:02,160
Why are we here?
Why are we here, Brendan?

1632
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:03,703
Why are we here?
Are we here to win this fight?

1633
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:05,038
Are we here to win this fight?

1634
01:49:05,122 --> 01:49:07,790
You tell me. 'Cause if we're not,
l will throw in the towel.

1635
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:09,834
We will get Tess and we will go home.

1636
01:49:09,918 --> 01:49:11,919
We'll go home, okay?

1637
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:14,922
You don't knock him out,
you lose the fight.

1638
01:49:15,174 --> 01:49:16,966
Do you understand me?

1639
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,803
You don't knock him out,
you don't have a home.

1640
01:49:21,263 --> 01:49:23,264
Let's go! Seconds out! Seconds out!

1641
01:49:42,451 --> 01:49:44,786
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1642
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:52,502
Conlon somehow
answering the call to round three.

1643
01:49:52,586 --> 01:49:55,004
And Koba's all over him once again.

1644
01:49:58,092 --> 01:49:59,300
Brendan's giving back, Bryan.

1645
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:01,219
I mean, there's signs of life
in Brendan Conlon.

1646
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:03,638
He's starting to mix it up.

1647
01:50:11,772 --> 01:50:13,147
Pummel, pummel, pummel.

1648
01:50:15,943 --> 01:50:18,319
He's taking Koba down,
but the Russian's back up.

1649
01:50:19,113 --> 01:50:20,905
Brendan shoots him again,
pressing him against the cage.

1650
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:23,741
- Yes!
- Whoa, he's fallen deep into a guillotine.

1651
01:50:23,826 --> 01:50:25,701
Well, Conlon trapped in an iron vice here,

1652
01:50:25,786 --> 01:50:27,745
and Koba now squeezing his neck
for all it's worth,

1653
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:28,830
trying to choke the teacher out.

1654
01:50:28,914 --> 01:50:31,749
Hips, hips, hips! Breathe! Breathe!

1655
01:50:31,834 --> 01:50:33,835
Ride it out! Ride it out!

1656
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:36,420
Conlon looking for a way out.

1657
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:39,340
- What is this?
- Just tossed Koba. Can you believe this?

1658
01:50:39,424 --> 01:50:42,093
He just shook off a guillotine
and tossed Koba.

1659
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:44,387
Conlon's looking for an armbar.
He's looking for that armbar,

1660
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:47,014
- and he's trying to submit the Russian bear.
- Hips, hips, hips!

1661
01:50:47,099 --> 01:50:48,474
Yeah, you got him!
You got him! You got him!

1662
01:50:49,101 --> 01:50:50,893
Koba slips right out.

1663
01:50:51,436 --> 01:50:54,355
Conlon's staying after him.
He's squeezing the bear.

1664
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:58,151
The tables have turned and the boy scout
is actually messing with the bear.

1665
01:50:58,235 --> 01:51:00,361
The teacher springing off the fence and
going for a mountain,

1666
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:01,445
- but Koba's on his feet.
- Get up, get up!

1667
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:03,030
He does not want to be
on the ground with Brendan

1668
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:05,116
and his endless bag of submissions.

1669
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:08,619
Koba trying to reestablish his dominance
with brutal shots to the face.

1670
01:51:08,704 --> 01:51:11,622
But Conlon's showing no fear.
This is a fight!

1671
01:51:11,707 --> 01:51:13,958
We have got ourselves a fight!

1672
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:19,964
Wow, that's a huge elbow to the head.

1673
01:51:20,048 --> 01:51:22,300
And now, Conlon goes for a knee bar.
He's got it very deep!

1674
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:24,385
He's got it very, very deep!

1675
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,803
He's deep on that.

1676
01:51:26,555 --> 01:51:27,972
He's got Koba in a lot of pain.

1677
01:51:28,056 --> 01:51:29,849
We saw this with Midnight,
we saw it against The Dane,

1678
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:31,642
and we're seeing it here! Brendan Conlon...

1679
01:51:31,977 --> 01:51:34,520
Break it! Break it! Break it!

1680
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:36,647
Not letting out!

1681
01:51:36,732 --> 01:51:38,816
Conlon wrenching that knee
for all it's worth.

1682
01:51:38,901 --> 01:51:40,651
He's putting everything he has into it.

1683
01:51:42,154 --> 01:51:44,488
And Koba is screaming in pain.

1684
01:51:44,573 --> 01:51:45,573
Koba taps.

1685
01:51:45,657 --> 01:51:48,075
Koba has tapped!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1686
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:51,954
I can't believe it!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1687
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:54,624
He's tapped Koba!

1688
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:57,460
And Frank Campana can't believe it.

1689
01:51:57,544 --> 01:52:00,087
This whole place can't believe it.
l can't believe it.

1690
01:52:00,172 --> 01:52:03,382
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba.

1691
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:07,595
- Tess!
- You got it! You did it!

1692
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:10,973
Brendan taps the world Sambo
champ with a knee bar!

1693
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:12,683
- Babe, you did it!
- Brendan Conlon!

1694
01:52:12,768 --> 01:52:15,519
- I don't know what to say. It's amazing!
- I don't know what I just saw.

1695
01:52:15,604 --> 01:52:17,772
I just don't know
how to put this into context.

1696
01:52:17,856 --> 01:52:20,691
That's gotta be the biggest upset
in MMA history.

1697
01:52:20,776 --> 01:52:22,860
I have never seen anything like this.

1698
01:52:22,945 --> 01:52:26,405
He tapped a world Sambo champion
in a knee bar!

1699
01:52:28,242 --> 01:52:31,535
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba!

1700
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:35,456
Brendan Conlon, the physics teacher!
Brendan Conlon, the civilian!

1701
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:37,708
He's done the impossible.

1702
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:41,254
He has done the impossible.
He's pulled off a miracle.

1703
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:45,466
This place is going crazy
because they've just seen a miracle.

1704
01:52:57,271 --> 01:52:59,772
This is CNN Breaking News.

1705
01:53:00,482 --> 01:53:04,235
A surprising turn in the story
of Iraq War hero, Tommy Riordan.

1706
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:07,822
CNN has learned that
Riordan's true identity

1707
01:53:07,906 --> 01:53:10,741
is that of Marine Staff Sergeant
Thomas Conlon,

1708
01:53:10,826 --> 01:53:13,703
who went AWOL from his unit
earlier this year,

1709
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:16,664
following the friendly fire death
of his brother-in-arms,

1710
01:53:16,748 --> 01:53:18,124
Sergeant Manny Fernandez.

1711
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:21,335
Fernandez's wife, Pilar Fernandez,
spoke with me

1712
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:24,046
in an exclusive interview, moments ago.

1713
01:53:24,673 --> 01:53:26,632
The bombs started dropping.

1714
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:30,261
They were coming from US planes.

1715
01:53:30,345 --> 01:53:34,181
Tommy and Manny were waving their flags

1716
01:53:35,142 --> 01:53:37,601
to let them know they were Americans,

1717
01:53:37,686 --> 01:53:39,312
but they didn't stop.

1718
01:53:40,856 --> 01:53:42,356
Everyone died.

1719
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:44,984
Everyone except Tommy.

1720
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:49,280
And, you know, my Manny used to say,

1721
01:53:52,034 --> 01:53:54,535
that Tommy was the brother he never had.

1722
01:53:55,203 --> 01:53:59,165
Conlon, who is fighting in the mixed
martial arts mega tournament, Sparta,

1723
01:53:59,249 --> 01:54:02,626
is expected to be taken into custody
by military police,

1724
01:54:02,711 --> 01:54:05,838
following tonight's winner-take-all finale
in Atlantic City.

1725
01:54:05,922 --> 01:54:10,301
If victorious, he has pledged
his $5 million purse

1726
01:54:10,385 --> 01:54:12,261
to the widow of his fallen comrade.

1727
01:54:13,972 --> 01:54:15,973
We've just got some incredible news,

1728
01:54:16,058 --> 01:54:18,726
that I'm having trouble
putting into context, but here it is.

1729
01:54:19,061 --> 01:54:22,980
The two men
fighting for the championship tonight,

1730
01:54:23,065 --> 01:54:25,232
for the $5 million prize,

1731
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:28,819
for the middleweight championship
of the world,

1732
01:54:28,904 --> 01:54:30,404
are brothers.

1733
01:54:56,598 --> 01:54:58,849
All right, let's get this off.

1734
01:55:16,076 --> 01:55:17,952
What are you gonna do?

1735
01:55:22,833 --> 01:55:24,583
I'm gonna fight him.

1736
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:38,866
- Mr. C, Mr. C!
- Mr. C, Mr. C!

1737
01:57:24,621 --> 01:57:27,790
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1738
01:58:26,141 --> 01:58:27,474
Gentlemen.

1739
01:58:34,316 --> 01:58:36,734
Gentlemen, this is the final.
l expect a clean fight.

1740
01:58:36,818 --> 01:58:39,903
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1741
01:58:39,988 --> 01:58:41,780
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1742
01:58:41,865 --> 01:58:43,282
Where's Pop?

1743
01:59:03,678 --> 01:59:05,679
Gentlemen, are you ready?

1744
01:59:06,931 --> 01:59:08,349
Are you ready?

1745
01:59:09,684 --> 01:59:10,851
Let's go to war!

1746
01:59:22,906 --> 01:59:24,865
Relax, Brendan, relax!

1747
01:59:28,912 --> 01:59:30,537
Get out! Get out of there!

1748
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:36,960
Throw your hands!

1749
01:59:37,045 --> 01:59:39,129
Don't lose it. No, no, no!

1750
01:59:39,214 --> 01:59:40,714
Move! Move!

1751
01:59:42,884 --> 01:59:46,053
Tie him up! Tie him up!
Control his moves. Control his moves.

1752
01:59:46,471 --> 01:59:48,931
Control the arms!
Keep control in the arms! Breathe!

1753
01:59:49,474 --> 01:59:52,393
You're okay! Relax! Breathe!

1754
01:59:58,233 --> 02:00:00,401
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1755
02:00:00,485 --> 02:00:02,403
Relax! Breathe!

1756
02:00:02,737 --> 02:00:05,656
Tie him up! Get up!
Tie him up, Brendan! Tie him up!

1757
02:00:06,366 --> 02:00:07,741
Come on. Get him! Get him! Get him!

1758
02:00:08,743 --> 02:00:10,077
Break!

1759
02:00:10,328 --> 02:00:11,578
What was that?

1760
02:00:11,663 --> 02:00:13,080
Hey, come on, Josh!

1761
02:00:13,331 --> 02:00:14,415
What's up with that?

1762
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:16,500
Hey, step back!

1763
02:00:16,584 --> 02:00:18,127
Watch that late blow!

1764
02:00:18,837 --> 02:00:20,087
Come on!

1765
02:00:28,263 --> 02:00:30,180
Come on, Josh! I mean, what is that?

1766
02:00:30,265 --> 02:00:32,433
Come on, come on. Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.

1767
02:00:32,517 --> 02:00:34,309
Sit... Brendan, sit down.

1768
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:36,478
Look at me. Sit down.

1769
02:00:37,105 --> 02:00:39,273
Brendan, look at me. Look at me.

1770
02:00:40,483 --> 02:00:44,862
Look at me, Brendan. Let it go.
Let it go, okay?

1771
02:00:44,946 --> 02:00:47,489
Breathe. Beethoven.

1772
02:00:48,116 --> 02:00:51,493
Okay. He's coming right at you, right?
Exactly like we planned.

1773
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:54,705
I want you to angle out,
hit and move every time. All right?

1774
02:00:54,789 --> 02:00:56,081
- Angle out and move.
- Good.

1775
02:00:56,166 --> 02:00:58,625
Breathe. Breathe. Come on, relax.

1776
02:01:00,712 --> 02:01:03,547
- Okay. He's not your brother, right?
- Time's up!

1777
02:01:03,631 --> 02:01:05,466
Look at me. He's not your brother, right?

1778
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:06,633
- All right.
- He's in the way.

1779
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:09,094
Seconds out. Wrap it up.

1780
02:01:09,179 --> 02:01:11,597
Taking a little more
time for the cheap shot.

1781
02:01:14,142 --> 02:01:15,976
Do your job, Josh.

1782
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:22,483
Come on, babe. Come on.

1783
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:24,234
Let's go to war.

1784
02:01:24,319 --> 02:01:25,319
Breathe!

1785
02:01:30,492 --> 02:01:32,701
Pace, pace! Control the pace!

1786
02:01:43,004 --> 02:01:44,004
Cover up!

1787
02:01:44,923 --> 02:01:47,257
Come on, get off the fence!

1788
02:01:47,342 --> 02:01:48,509
Get off the fence!

1789
02:01:49,344 --> 02:01:50,552
Hands up! Hands up!

1790
02:01:52,013 --> 02:01:54,932
Head up! You're all right! Relax! Breathe!

1791
02:01:56,935 --> 02:01:58,018
Yeah!

1792
02:02:04,526 --> 02:02:05,526
Get him!

1793
02:02:08,530 --> 02:02:11,573
- Huge throw. Huge.
- Look at that.

1794
02:02:11,658 --> 02:02:13,283
Turn in! Don't give him your back!

1795
02:02:13,368 --> 02:02:15,035
Turn in! Go! Good! Good!

1796
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:20,290
Come on, get out of it! Go! Get up!

1797
02:02:21,835 --> 02:02:23,252
Control the arms! Control the arms!

1798
02:02:25,630 --> 02:02:28,173
Cover up, cover up. Push it!

1799
02:02:29,884 --> 02:02:31,385
Break free! Break! Break!

1800
02:02:33,137 --> 02:02:36,014
Good, good, good!
Clean break! Stop! Hey, stop!

1801
02:02:36,099 --> 02:02:37,724
- Come on.
- Here we go, mom.

1802
02:02:37,809 --> 02:02:41,353
Time to lock up your china,
the boys are at it again!

1803
02:02:47,318 --> 02:02:48,402
Let's go to war!

1804
02:03:06,379 --> 02:03:08,297
Now! Get up! Get up!

1805
02:03:09,299 --> 02:03:10,841
Get up! Come on, babe!
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1806
02:03:10,925 --> 02:03:12,759
Control it! Control it with the arms.

1807
02:03:12,844 --> 02:03:14,386
Switch! Switch!

1808
02:03:16,514 --> 02:03:17,848
Hips!

1809
02:03:18,391 --> 02:03:20,142
Down, down. Hips down.

1810
02:03:23,938 --> 02:03:27,190
Oh, my God. That's a deep omoplata there.
He's got the seats up.

1811
02:03:28,610 --> 02:03:30,277
Come on, Tommy!

1812
02:03:35,074 --> 02:03:37,367
You've got him, babe! You've got him, babe!
Come on, tap him out!

1813
02:03:38,119 --> 02:03:39,244
Tom!

1814
02:03:46,753 --> 02:03:48,003
Break! Break! Break!

1815
02:03:48,087 --> 02:03:50,631
Tommy, you okay?

1816
02:03:55,136 --> 02:03:57,638
- Tommy!
- Go! Let's go! Go!

1817
02:03:57,722 --> 02:03:59,139
Calm down. Calm down.

1818
02:04:00,183 --> 02:04:02,726
- It's the championship. Keep it together.
- All right. All right. I got it.

1819
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:04,311
Sit down. Sit down!

1820
02:04:11,778 --> 02:04:13,570
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1821
02:04:13,655 --> 02:04:16,865
- I popped his shoulder.
- Relax. Breathe. Breathe.

1822
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:18,575
- I heard it tear.
- You popped his shoulder?

1823
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:19,701
- Yeah.
- Good. Okay.

1824
02:04:19,786 --> 02:04:22,412
I want you to pop his other shoulder.
Let's go.

1825
02:04:22,497 --> 02:04:24,373
- Josh.
- Hey, hey, no Josh.

1826
02:04:24,457 --> 02:04:25,582
- Josh.
- Hey!

1827
02:04:25,667 --> 02:04:27,084
- Look at me. Look at me.
- What?

1828
02:04:27,168 --> 02:04:28,961
All right, you got two rounds. Two rounds.

1829
02:04:29,045 --> 02:04:30,337
We need both rounds.

1830
02:04:33,091 --> 02:04:34,174
What?

1831
02:04:34,258 --> 02:04:37,344
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1832
02:04:43,893 --> 02:04:47,020
Go in there, you kick him in the head,
take him down and finish him!

1833
02:04:54,612 --> 02:04:56,989
Tommy, what are you doing?

1834
02:04:57,740 --> 02:04:59,366
Shut up. Come on.

1835
02:05:00,326 --> 02:05:01,785
Stand back.

1836
02:05:02,537 --> 02:05:05,664
Come on. What? Have you gone crazy?

1837
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:08,834
Let's go to war!

1838
02:05:10,211 --> 02:05:12,546
Brendan, pick your hands up!

1839
02:05:13,256 --> 02:05:14,506
It's over.

1840
02:05:15,717 --> 02:05:18,385
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1841
02:05:19,887 --> 02:05:21,555
It's over, Tommy.

1842
02:05:21,806 --> 02:05:22,806
You better fight!

1843
02:05:33,735 --> 02:05:35,819
It's over, Tommy. Come on.

1844
02:05:39,949 --> 02:05:42,325
Tommy, we don't have to do this.

1845
02:05:54,130 --> 02:05:56,715
Come on.
Why do you want to do this, Tommy?

1846
02:05:57,050 --> 02:05:58,383
Am I gonna have to watch you do this?

1847
02:06:06,059 --> 02:06:08,310
Okay? You all right there?

1848
02:06:09,103 --> 02:06:10,437
Tommy!

1849
02:06:20,865 --> 02:06:23,366
Quick, finish him! You finish him!

1850
02:06:30,041 --> 02:06:31,416
Come on.

1851
02:06:42,178 --> 02:06:45,138
Break, break, break! Back up, back up!

1852
02:08:42,673 --> 02:08:46,259
I'm sorry, Tommy. I'm sorry.

1853
02:08:49,472 --> 02:08:51,431
Tap, Tommy.

1854
02:08:52,099 --> 02:08:54,559
It's okay. It's okay.

1855
02:09:04,528 --> 02:09:06,071
I love you.

1856
02:09:07,281 --> 02:09:08,782
I love you, Tommy.
