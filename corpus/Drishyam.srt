1
00:00:09,168 --> 00:00:11,501
Tobacco use leads to cancer,

2
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:15,460
heart attack, lung disorders
and other deadly diseases.

3
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:19,168
The characters shown in
this film or program do not..

4
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:22,835
...support the use of any
type of tobacco products such as..

5
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:25,793
...bidis,
cigarettes, khaini, zarda etc.

6
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,668
Or their promotion in any manner.

7
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:36,501
Ticket

8
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:54,251
Ticket

9
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:57,793
Ticket

10
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:59,460
One ticket for Manjalipara.

11
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:04,043
I've to get down here.

12
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:07,918
Hello.

13
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:11,335
Yes, I'm on a journey.

14
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:14,543
I'll call you once I reach there.

15
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,085
One Arakunnam.

16
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:35,918
One Arakunnam.

17
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:50,001
One Arakunnam please.

18
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:51,251
Do you've change for Rs.1000?

19
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,335
Let me see.

20
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:18,001
A very reputed company.
I know many people working there.

21
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:27,126
I'll give you the change.

22
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:30,918
Get down here.

23
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:39,918
Here's the change.

24
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:09,418
What do you like to have?
Tea or coffee?

25
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:10,918
I've not come for food.

26
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,626
Where's the police station here?

27
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,293
Sir, are you a Policeman?

28
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:18,085
Yes I've been transferred
to this station.

29
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,293
That new building is the Police station.

30
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,251
Yesterday was its inauguration.

31
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:23,793
Oh I see!

32
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:26,751
Home Minister and
many officials had come.

33
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:30,793
That small building,
was the old police station.

34
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:32,501
A rented building!

35
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Normally all policemen
have tea from here.

36
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:39,835
What about your family?

37
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,376
My parents are in hometown,
at Perumbavoor.

38
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:45,960
What I meant by family was
your wife and children?

39
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,501
No, I'm not yet married.

40
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,501
Oh single!

41
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,335
The unmarried and those living here
without families,

42
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:57,876
take 3 square meals from my hotel.

43
00:05:58,168 --> 00:05:59,585
You can also,

44
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,126
Let it be... See you then.

45
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,668
A good policeman!

46
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:22,210
Is S.I there?

47
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:24,085
Yet to come. What do you want?

48
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:26,043
I'm Antony,
being transferred to this station.

49
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:27,751
- Where were you working earlier?
- Ernakulam.

50
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:30,835
S.I will come shortly.
You wait inside.

51
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:38,293
Hello Rajakadu Police station.

52
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:40,460
S.I has not come, Sir

53
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,960
He has gone for a meeting with RDM, Sir

54
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:45,918
I'll convey when he comes.

55
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:52,960
How about your stay?

56
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,293
Isn't he George kutty?

57
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:56,793
Yes Yes!

58
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,001
Seems to be an innocent fellow!

59
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,210
How far is his case?

60
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:02,626
Calling him innocent?!

61
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:03,960
How many of them know the truth?

62
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,710
And those who know it are shocked.

63
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,126
George kutty chetta!

64
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,876
- What an amazing chase!
- No! Not that better.

65
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:09,085
Direction is not that good.

66
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:11,960
Hero who drives the car
should have little more shots.

67
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,710
Only then the audience
will have a thrill

68
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,418
Shall I ask you something serious?

69
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:18,501
Why can't you direct a film?

70
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:25,585
What was the response?

71
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:27,001
A few of them gave money.

72
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:31,460
That Policeman Sahadevan,
As usual, he was trying to threaten.

73
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:35,251
When I go for collection, people are
waiting with too many complaints.

74
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,085
And Mangalathu Thomachhan chettan,

75
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:40,418
His T.V screen still flickers.

76
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:43,460
Didn't we make a person
check it a few days back?

77
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:48,793
Didn't you say it's his T.V's defect
and he has to repair it himself?

78
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:50,626
Yes. I told him

79
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:52,168
But he called your father names.

80
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:53,543
Have you come back silently
listening to them?

81
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:55,043
I too called names.

82
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,668
Well done! You're smart!
What did you remark?

83
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:58,460
I said no point calling
his father names,

84
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,293
because he doesn't
know who's his father!

85
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:01,251
You"?

86
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:04,501
Didn't I tell the fact?
Aren't you an orphan?

87
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,460
You really don't know your father is it?

88
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:09,543
This fellow..

89
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:19,710
Hey Raghu..

90
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:21,668
Where has he gone?

91
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:22,668
Here I'm coming.

92
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:24,876
- How much?
- Rs.12.

93
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:26,210
Yes brother.

94
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:27,710
Where were you for a long time?

95
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,001
I told you many times to stay
at shop when customers are there

96
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:30,710
Give them tea.

97
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,293
Raghu, my usual one.

98
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,585
Have Policemen left?

99
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:36,668
Yes they already left.

100
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:38,835
Our Pulli (Tiger) has to come.

101
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:39,835
You mean Sahadevan?

102
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,585
They are waiting for him.

103
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:43,626
Who are they?
For what purpose?

104
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,751
Their condition is too pathetic.

105
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,626
They belong to this place only.

106
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,460
They have an only son.

107
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:52,835
Their son borrowed money at
high interest from some Finance company,

108
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:54,335
for agricultural purpose.

109
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,335
And also paid interest
promptly every month.

110
00:09:57,585 --> 00:09:58,710
There were no expected yields.

111
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,001
Hence he couldn't repay the interest.

112
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:03,043
Sahadevan took away my son two days ago.

113
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:06,626
Only if I settle the Principal
and Interest, he will be freed.

114
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:08,168
- Who said?
- Finance company.

115
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:09,876
Sahadevan is their accomplice.

116
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,501
Couldn't you take this matter to S.I?

117
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,460
He threatens to kill my son if
I complain against him to his seniors.

118
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,543
Even if you complain also,
no positive results would be there.

119
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:21,168
It must be an influential
Finance company.

120
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:24,501
Will uninfluenced people
like us get justice here?

121
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,751
Don't we have a court here?

122
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,876
No point in suing against them.

123
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:31,626
Finance company hasn't
detained their son.

124
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,918
But a Policeman had taken away his son.

125
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:35,293
There are no proof also.

126
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,876
A court needs evidence.

127
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:50,460
I think if you file Habeas Corpus,
it'll work out.

128
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:51,751
How?

129
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:56,335
Father, All of them are aware of
Officer's interest in this case.

130
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,376
Nobody knows where Basheer is!

131
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:00,293
Basheer who escaped from jail,

132
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:03,293
If we move a writ, stating that
officer has grilled Basheer illegally,

133
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:03,918
Who will move?

134
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:04,918
Basheer's mother.

135
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:07,793
THERE'S ONE WAY!

136
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,668
There's an Advocate
Sukumaran Nair in Thoddupuzha.

137
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:14,501
Meet his Junior Mathews.

138
00:11:14,793 --> 00:11:16,126
I know him personally.

139
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,126
Tell him your problem in detail.

140
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:19,210
I shall also inform him.

141
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:21,585
George kutty, is there any point
in filing a case?

142
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:23,043
It's not an ordinary case as you think,

143
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,293
but Habeas Corpus.

144
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:26,376
When teenage girls elope
with their boyfriends,

145
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:30,418
Normally girls' parents file such a case
to get back their daughters.

146
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:31,710
That's,

147
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,751
If he moves a Habaes Corpus that
somebody detained his son illegally,

148
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,043
immediately Court will order
Police to produce

149
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:40,876
the concerned person
at the Court earliest.

150
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:42,501
No matter how influential you may be,

151
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,835
because Police will be in trouble
if they don't abide court's order.

152
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,001
Very good idea!

153
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:48,668
If my guess is right,
case may also not be required.

154
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,251
Advocate Sukumaran
Nair should call Sahadevan,

155
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:54,293
and inform that Habeas Corpus will be
filed if his son is not freed.

156
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:55,793
He'll be freed at once.

157
00:11:56,126 --> 00:11:58,460
Don't think, go immediately

158
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,210
Hello, Mr. Sahadevan is coming.

159
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,043
If you stay here any longer,

160
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:11,710
I'll get good business
but your money will go.

161
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:15,085
You better leave through the back door.

162
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:31,876
Did any elderly man and woman come here?

163
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,710
No.

164
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:34,460
No?

165
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:37,668
Then where did they go?

166
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:44,460
Raghu, what's today's special?

167
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,835
Nothing special! Same as usual.

168
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:49,376
Okay then get me four dosas and chutney.

169
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:51,335
Only rotten dosas and chutney
available all the time.

170
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:53,793
Couldn't you make
any other special dishes?

171
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:57,585
Oh my dear Sahadevan sir!
Don't I need money for all that?

172
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,918
Yes you're right.

173
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:01,418
Most of the customers eat on credit.

174
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:04,376
And half of them won't
repay my dues also.

175
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:05,335
What else could I do?

176
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:10,585
That was intended for me, right?

177
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:15,460
Oh no my dear sir.
I just said the truth.

178
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:20,210
Including you,
all policemen owe me a huge sum.

179
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,126
I am not getting even half of that now!
How else could I?

180
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,168
This is my only bread and butter.

181
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:28,543
You mean to say that only Policemen
are eating on credit?

182
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:30,210
Even George kutty eats on credit.

183
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,460
What about that credit?

184
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,585
I also eat on credit but repay
at the end of every week.

185
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:36,626
Okay then I shall also repay your money.

186
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:37,668
Check and tell me my balance.

187
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:40,543
Oh no sir. You can repay in
installments later.

188
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:42,251
Why are you afraid?

189
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,043
When he's ready to repay,
grab it immediately.

190
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:45,168
Otherwise you may never get it.

191
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:47,418
Hello, you don't meddle in this.

192
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:49,001
We'll settle it between us.

193
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:50,085
Oh a mediator!

194
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:52,876
Tell how much I have to pay

195
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:56,210
That would come around Rs.4500.

196
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:57,960
Only this much?

197
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,085
I'll settle these in a single payment.

198
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:02,126
And problem will also be solved by that.

199
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:05,335
Consider this money as my commission.

200
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:07,835
Now my due is settled!

201
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:10,210
Commission for what?

202
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:15,210
Our Police station has turned into
people-friendly Police station.

203
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:18,251
Government has already issued order to
build new police station.

204
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:21,918
New Police station is going
to come up there.

205
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:23,335
Work will start soon.

206
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,001
I'll get you business
from these workers.

207
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,335
That's the commission
that I told you now.

208
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,710
This business will not
end up in a day or two.

209
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:35,918
But this business will last
for 8 to 9 months.

210
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,460
To be honest,
this commission is too less.

211
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:44,251
Still I'll adjust it for time being
as we are in good relationship.

212
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,335
This is what is POLICE!

213
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,168
You didn't like it?

214
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:48,585
No, I didn't.

215
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:53,293
Because you are a policeman and he
a poor man, he didn't back answer you.

216
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,001
In the absence of
any other hotel nearby,

217
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,126
Whatever work happens there,

218
00:14:57,335 --> 00:14:58,876
Naturally all workers will
come here to take food

219
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:01,251
You don't have to get him
any business for that sake.

220
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:05,293
What if we policemen strongly warn them
not to take food from here!

221
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:08,460
You don't try to teach this Sahadevan.

222
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:12,085
- Get one strong tea..
- Raghu, Get him his usual one.

223
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,168
George kutty, how are things going?

224
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:16,710
What to say sir!
We're somehow running our lives.

225
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,543
It seems new police
station is coming up.

226
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,793
There is a chance for you
to get good business.

227
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:23,835
That deal is already confirmed
and commission is also taken.

228
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:25,293
Who took commission?

229
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:35,376
What's the difference between ordinary
police and people friendly police?

230
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,210
Don't you know? Off late there was
also an article in the news paper.

231
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,001
Will an uneducated read newspapers?

232
00:15:41,793 --> 00:15:43,668
Sir, I'm a poor illiterate!

233
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,835
And we don't gain general knowledge
just by reading papers

234
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:47,751
He's right.

235
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,918
Apart from that Corruption, Sexual
harassment and murder in news papers.

236
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,960
People friendly police adopts
a New Police culture.

237
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:58,626
People help Police to deter crimes.

238
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:03,043
In short, to bridge the gap
between Police and People.

239
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,585
Oh! Will it happen!

240
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:07,710
Will this work out in our place?

241
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:11,126
Nowadays criminals are increasing
in our Police department itself.

242
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:13,043
That is very less percentage

243
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:14,293
That's true.

244
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:15,626
Which ever department may be,

245
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:17,960
You can find some criminals,
like finding worms in Poison.

246
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,126
I'm an ordinary citizen.

247
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:27,168
According to my vision,
Police should be peoples' savior.

248
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:30,710
We should feel secured when
stepping into Police station.

249
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:32,001
But what happens here.

250
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:34,460
Even a person who hadn't
committed any mistake

251
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,835
steps into Police station with fright..

252
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:37,626
You're right George kutty.

253
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:40,626
Here, it is dominated by
People friendly Police.

254
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:03,085
Georgekutty Chetta! Georgekutty Chetta.

255
00:17:04,043 --> 00:17:04,751
Yes tell me.

256
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,960
Is the advertisement design okay?

257
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,335
- Georgekutty chetta!
- Tell me.

258
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,418
Advertisement!

259
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:17,376
Increase the font size of mobile number.

260
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,293
It should also be readable to old people

261
00:17:20,835 --> 00:17:24,168
It should stay at least for 10 second,
Only then you'll have reading time.

262
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:29,418
You're receiving a complaint.

263
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,960
Only bad things will
slip out of your tongue.

264
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,918
Would anybody else call us
other than complains?

265
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:37,335
Doesn't my wife call here?

266
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:38,751
She's also a complaint box.

267
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:39,960
Enough of talking, pick up the call.

268
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,751
Whoever may be, tell them I'm not here,

269
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:43,126
And ask for the matter.

270
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:45,918
Hello Rani vision.

271
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:47,293
Shucks!

272
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,210
What's this!

273
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:02,293
Who was it?

274
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:04,293
Parapalli Thomacchan!

275
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,418
It seems amplifier near his house
is not working since 3 days.

276
00:18:08,585 --> 00:18:10,418
Didn't I ask you to
change it the same day?

277
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:14,168
- I forgot.
- Then you deserve his abuse!

278
00:18:17,335 --> 00:18:18,293
Here's the other one.

279
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:20,418
- Pick it up.
- You pick it up.

280
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:23,626
Pick up the phone and say I'm not here
And ask for the matter.

281
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,876
Hello, Rani Vision.

282
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:28,668
Yes... You mean Georgekutty Chettan?

283
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,918
Oh no! He's not here.

284
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:33,960
Do I've to convey anything?

285
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:34,918
Yes sure!

286
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,835
I'll surely convey it.

287
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:44,460
It's not a complaint but a request.

288
00:18:44,793 --> 00:18:45,751
Who?

289
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,460
Puthampuzha Sankaraettan!

290
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:49,126
What's it?

291
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:51,376
Are you going to telecast
adult film tonight

292
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:53,585
He's Paralysed, isn't he?

293
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:57,335
Only left side is weak but
his right side is quite strong.

294
00:18:58,585 --> 00:18:59,543
Hey you.

295
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:47,418
Dear, where's mother?

296
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:48,626
She must be in Kitchen, father.

297
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:49,751
You woke up early?

298
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,335
Test paper father!

299
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:52,543
Okay, go ahead and study.

300
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,251
If you keep the front doors open,
won't the thieves enter?

301
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:15,793
Do thieves come to rob in the morning?

302
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:17,501
This generation thieves are too clever.

303
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:20,543
They very well know that dump-ass
like you would only think this way.

304
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:22,251
Is the hot water ready for my bath?

305
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:23,793
Go and see in the bathroom.

306
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:27,210
- Are you also coming to take bath?
- Shucks! Get off!

307
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:37,126
- Where's Anu?
- Standing before the mirror.

308
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:38,501
How much ever we tell...

309
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,001
So long to dress up?

310
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:41,335
Anu dear.

311
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:42,293
Coming mother.

312
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:44,085
Hasn't our Ms. India's makeup over?

313
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:49,960
Look at the way she butters him.

314
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,585
You didn't like it?

315
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,335
You won't do and also
tease others who do.

316
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,876
Was it raining near
your office last evening?

317
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,251
No. Did it rain here?

318
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:06,668
No. I called up several times,
but was not reachable,

319
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:08,543
That's why I asked you.

320
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:10,918
One rain is enough
to make your phone dead.

321
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:12,710
Father, can't you get a mobile phone?

322
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,918
When the range is neither there
nor here, then what's the point?

323
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:16,460
If you get range,
will you buy a mobile, father?

324
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:18,876
Probably.

325
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:20,710
I've already selected a mobile.

326
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:24,543
- Must be a second hand?
- That's for sure.

327
00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:30,085
You never asked me
the reason for calling.

328
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:32,168
I'm not interested.

329
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,293
Yes that is true, you're not interested
to take care of your family.

330
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:41,043
Sitting at office and watching films
round the clock, is enough for you.

331
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,543
We three ladies are
staying at home alone.

332
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,793
At least having that in mind,
you should come home in the night.

333
00:21:47,085 --> 00:21:48,085
But you're least interested.

334
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:49,543
Oh God! Please stop.
I said that simply.

335
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:51,293
I'm interested.
I'm very much interested.

336
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:52,668
Tell me why you called me.

337
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:55,835
Tell me dear, why you called me.

338
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:59,210
We plan to go to Thoddupuzha.

339
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:00,668
Thoddupuzha?! Why?

340
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,876
For a shopping-

341
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:04,710
Shopping?! What shopping?!

342
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,668
To get few dresses.

343
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:08,293
Just 6 months back we got dresses.

344
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,460
What about those?

345
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,335
They're completely torn and faded.

346
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:12,210
So quickly?

347
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,376
Yes. I told you to buy from good shop.

348
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,126
But you said,
"children would grow faster".

349
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,918
"We can purchase them often
if bought at cheaper rates"

350
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,293
In that excuse,
you got me sarees of poor quality.

351
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:25,376
Did I say so?

352
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:29,585
- Yes father you said.
- True, I heard you saying so.

353
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,710
Agreed, but why Thoddupuzha?

354
00:22:32,043 --> 00:22:33,210
Good shop is close by,
let's purchase from there.

355
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:37,293
No way. It's not only for shopping,
we also wish to have biriyani,

356
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:39,793
watch movie in an
air-conditioned theater,

357
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,918
Mother, what about ice-cream?

358
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,918
Yes that also. We've many such wishes.

359
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:55,251
Men who always stays
out round the clock,

360
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:59,043
won't be able to read the minds of
women confined to Kitchen.

361
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,501
We also have many wishes.

362
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,376
I go out as a part of my job,

363
00:23:04,668 --> 00:23:05,835
And not to enjoy.

364
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:08,626
If you are confined to home,
it's a part of your job.

365
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:11,418
When a girl gets married,
and becomes a wife and a mother,

366
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:12,918
her life is totally confined to
home.

367
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:14,376
That's her responsibility.

368
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:16,460
And it's not an adversity or pain.

369
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,126
You should've a mind to understand it.

370
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:21,001
You learn this from Samyuktha.

371
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:23,585
Which Samuktha?

372
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:26,251
Samyuktha! Samyuktha Varma!
malayalam film actress)

373
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:27,543
Biju Menon's wife.

374
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:30,001
She got married at the height of fame!

375
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:32,626
Still she leads a life as a
good wife and a good mother.

376
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:33,585
Learn from her.

377
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:35,001
Whatever I say,

378
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:36,835
Immediately you cite examples
from film and film actors

379
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:38,043
Your mother couldn't answer my question.

380
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,418
It's not that I can't answer you.

381
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,501
Okay then answer me.

382
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:43,085
You tell me what's wrong in my saying!

383
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:47,751
This Samyuktha Varma's, husband
Biju Menon is really a smart fellow.

384
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:50,168
He earns money in crores

385
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:53,126
Samyuktha has servants,
car and driver

386
00:23:53,376 --> 00:23:55,043
He gives a luxurious life to her.

387
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:58,251
Apart from that,
they also go for overseas trips often.

388
00:23:58,543 --> 00:24:00,168
A few days back, as Biju Menon
was held up with work,

389
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:02,460
he sent Samyuktha and
his son alone to America.

390
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,626
That's how loving husbands should be.

391
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:06,710
Well! They consult her
to go for overseas trip!

392
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:08,210
What mother said is right, father!

393
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,251
It was mentioned in Vanitha
(women's magazine).

394
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:10,918
Don't ever get that magazine here.

395
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:12,293
Heck with that Vanitha!

396
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:14,501
You know how they traveled?

397
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,543
In aeroplane.

398
00:24:15,543 --> 00:24:18,085
To go to America, instead of an
aeroplane, can we take an autorickshaw?

399
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:22,210
Father, would we go to America any day?

400
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:28,293
Let's end this topic here.

401
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:29,918
We'll go for shopping on Saturday.

402
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,876
- To Thoddupuzha!
- If it is Thodupuzha! Then Thodupuzha

403
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:33,793
Always pestering for shopping!

404
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:51,335
Why are you digging here?

405
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:52,918
For making a compost pit.

406
00:24:52,918 --> 00:24:54,793
Why are you taking so much pain?

407
00:24:55,168 --> 00:24:57,001
Isn't it enough if you ask
2 or 3 workers to do this?

408
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,126
Are you aware of the wages
these days for scooping soil?

409
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:02,126
If you put some fertilizer,
there's no need for this.

410
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,251
Foolish like you would
only think that way.

411
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:06,668
Be Roman while you are in Rome,
instead of that...

412
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:09,293
You know what earth worm is?

413
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:11,418
I know and I've also seen it.

414
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:16,085
During my childhood,
to bait fish for the prey

415
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:17,376
It's enough if I just scoop
the soil with spade,

416
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:18,001
You would find many earthworms

417
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:19,293
Even if you dig 10 cents of land now,

418
00:25:19,293 --> 00:25:20,793
You're lucky enough
if you get at least one.

419
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,376
It is this Chemical fertilizer
that destroyed them.

420
00:25:23,376 --> 00:25:24,710
Ultimately what happened!

421
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:27,251
All sorts of crops are
affected by diseases,

422
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:29,626
Just to make our jobs easier.

423
00:25:30,043 --> 00:25:33,543
How do you gain so much knowledge
when you don't even read news papers?

424
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:36,460
It's not necessary that we will
gain knowledge by reading or studying.

425
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,960
We should've an observatory-mind

426
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,085
Things happening around us...

427
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:42,710
Hello! No need of your long speech.

428
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:45,335
I too saw the film- Ividam Swargamanu.

429
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:51,168
In order to save workers' wages,
when I saw you suffer,

430
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:52,918
I felt pity on you and asked.

431
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:54,585
Yes indeed! Only with such savings,

432
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:56,585
we bought these 5 acres
of land and our house.

433
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:58,210
It was a barren land and I..

434
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,501
Please don't repeat that story again.

435
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,751
I and our children are fed up
hearing this story.

436
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:06,126
Of late, you're boasting too much...

437
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,501
This is not boasting

438
00:26:07,793 --> 00:26:10,710
Being born as an Orphan,
It's my Honor, Self confidence.

439
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,210
It's you who brags.

440
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,710
Me- a 4th std PASS - being
teased by you- a tenth std FAIL?

441
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,418
Whatever this 4th class man earn
of hardwork, You spend it by shopping.

442
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:23,376
The way you speak it looks
as though I go shopping every week.

443
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:26,626
I hardly go out twice a year
and get few dresses.

444
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,918
Is that what you called
as a mega shopping.

445
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:30,501
Okay I shall put an end to that also.

446
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:32,376
And walk without clothes this way.

447
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:36,543
What's so funny?

448
00:26:37,251 --> 00:26:40,626
I was just imagining you
walking without clothes

449
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:43,793
You dirty fellow.

450
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,335
I must be blamed
to come and talk to you.

451
00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:48,668
If you do back breaking work,
you can eat till your teeth breaks

452
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,293
I don't want to eat
till my teeth breaks.

453
00:26:50,293 --> 00:26:51,335
Oh that's it!

454
00:27:10,793 --> 00:27:13,251
Hey Monicha! What are you looking for?

455
00:27:13,251 --> 00:27:14,293
Just like that...

456
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:15,501
Didn't you go for the collection today?

457
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:16,668
Yes, I just reached after that.

458
00:27:16,876 --> 00:27:18,543
Tomorrow is rent collecting day
in the building.

459
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:19,668
Did you inform them?

460
00:27:19,668 --> 00:27:21,835
Yes I told them and then
went for collection.

461
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:24,293
New Police Station work has begun.

462
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,918
The one, who's standing there,
is the Engineer.

463
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,751
Had you studied well, you could've
also become an Engineer wearing a tie!

464
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:33,085
Who is advising me?!
At least I've studied up to 10th class.

465
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:33,626
What did you say?

466
00:27:33,626 --> 00:27:35,960
I needn't become
an Engineer to wear a tie.

467
00:27:36,168 --> 00:27:38,460
You come to office,
we've to check accounts.

468
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,751
One tea please.

469
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,126
Raghu, one tea please.

470
00:27:54,126 --> 00:27:56,001
How long will it take
to complete the work?

471
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,210
Around 5-6 months.

472
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:58,960
It's profitable if the
work is completed soon.

473
00:27:59,751 --> 00:28:01,085
George kutty, come here.

474
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:06,835
He's Soman!
Contractor of New Police Station.

475
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:07,960
I'm Sub contractor.

476
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,501
I take up civil work.

477
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:10,835
Main contractor is a different person.

478
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:12,418
What are you doing?

479
00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:13,168
I'm...

480
00:28:13,168 --> 00:28:17,793
He's George kutty. Cable T.V Operator.

481
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:21,876
His office is at upstairs
in that building.

482
00:28:22,085 --> 00:28:23,501
And he owns that building also.

483
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,460
George Kutty cheta!
Your wife called up.

484
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:27,835
Asked whether
"you're coming home or staying here?"

485
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:29,710
Tell her that I'm staying here.

486
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,626
Are you staying here at night?

487
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,001
Some days I stay here.

488
00:28:33,293 --> 00:28:35,460
He's fond of films.

489
00:28:35,751 --> 00:28:38,251
He sits and watches films at night.

490
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:40,085
Don't you've a T.V at home?

491
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:41,085
He's joking.

492
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:43,085
Somebody must be here at night.

493
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:45,043
Particularly while raining.

494
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:48,001
People would call in case
if there's any power cut or line defect.

495
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:50,710
Some responsible person should be here.

496
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:52,751
If we can't provide good service,

497
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:54,418
Then People will not
pay money stating that reason.

498
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:55,751
<i>Okay-</i>

499
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:58,085
He didn't tell you the entire thing.

500
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:01,085
If Cable doesn't
work between 11pm - 1am,

501
00:29:01,085 --> 00:29:03,751
Then all youngsters and
oldies will pounce at him,

502
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:07,460
And then it would festive of abuses!

503
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,501
You be quiet!

504
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:09,793
Let me explain him.

505
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:15,126
Only during that time, in Fashion T.V,
few obscene scenes are shown.

506
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:17,335
Is it appropriate to talk
ill of our own people?

507
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:18,460
What did I talk ill of them?

508
00:29:18,793 --> 00:29:24,085
Let everybody know that
our people also have feelings.

509
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:26,335
Okay Soma, let's talk in detail later.

510
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,335
I'm going home. I've severe headache.

511
00:29:56,543 --> 00:29:57,418
You take care.

512
00:29:57,418 --> 00:29:58,293
<i>Okay-</i>

513
00:29:58,293 --> 00:29:59,710
Foolish boy didn't understand anything.

514
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:02,043
That bedroom scene is over is it?

515
00:30:07,293 --> 00:30:08,543
Foolish boy understood everything.

516
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:26,835
- What was the scene today?
- I will tell you

517
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,126
You can't enter that easily.

518
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,918
Tell me.

519
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,668
What was the scene today?

520
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,751
Bedroom scene or bathing scene.

521
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:35,126
Move! It was rape scene.

522
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,751
Probably you may require that today.

523
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:55,710
Is this all necessary at this old age?

524
00:30:56,168 --> 00:31:01,001
Who said I've become old?
I still feel 17 at heart

525
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,751
Shall I tell you something?

526
00:31:05,418 --> 00:31:06,960
You tell me dear Rani.

527
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,876
Shall we exchange our Jeep and
get a Maruthi car?

528
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,126
You didn't like it?

529
00:31:14,126 --> 00:31:16,293
This is the regular habit of all wives.

530
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,210
Taking advantage of husbands' weakness.

531
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,835
I'm not that sort of a husband.

532
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:20,835
I'm not an idiot.

533
00:31:21,126 --> 00:31:23,001
I know to bridle my emotions.

534
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:24,001
Mind your business.

535
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:25,751
Heck with her Maruthi!

536
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:31,960
Playing the fool with me.

537
00:32:08,335 --> 00:32:10,043
If you want Maruthi,
let's go for Maruthi.

538
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,585
Shall I ask you something?

539
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:16,168
Yes George kutta.

540
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:18,751
A second hand car is OK?

541
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:19,835
No.

542
00:32:19,835 --> 00:32:21,793
New car costs high.

543
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,960
- Don't go.
- Leave me.

544
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,293
Hey where are you?

545
00:32:34,668 --> 00:32:35,751
Even if I told several times,

546
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,585
Father, did you come last night?

547
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:40,793
Yes!

548
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,960
Why did you come last night?

549
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:46,085
You shut up and eat, come quickly.

550
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:47,543
Why are you getting angry?

551
00:32:47,543 --> 00:32:50,376
He rarely comes home at night,
that's why I asked.

552
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:52,918
You said you won't come,
then why did you come?

553
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:55,335
I've come to book a maruthi car.

554
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:00,293
We're buying a maruthi car.

555
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:02,335
Really, father?

556
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:04,210
- Really?
- Yes

557
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,085
Yes Yes.

558
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:06,293
Let's not buy Maruthi car.

559
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:07,751
We'll go for Audi

560
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:08,793
What?

561
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,793
Audi!

562
00:33:09,793 --> 00:33:10,960
That's a car, father.

563
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:12,543
A stylish car.

564
00:33:12,543 --> 00:33:13,543
Cheaper than Maruthi?

565
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:16,501
Oh my father! It costs around 40 lakhs.

566
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:18,293
Jeez! Is it made up of Gold?

567
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:20,793
This is the reason
you've to read news papers

568
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:23,418
How am I benefited knowing of
Chadi reading papers?

569
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,085
It's not Chadi but Audi.

570
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:26,668
Anyhow it won't suit us right?

571
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:27,626
Maruthi is enough for us.

572
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:29,001
When are we buying it?

573
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,376
Try to eat and go fast.

574
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,085
Are you not taking bath today?

575
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:35,418
I don't feel energetic today.

576
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,626
How can you dig a compost pit today?

577
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:39,251
I don't have any stamina for that.

578
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,501
My entire stamina
is exhausted last night.

579
00:33:48,168 --> 00:33:49,710
I meant to say, I rode bicycle
for a long time last night.

580
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,168
That's how my stamina got exhausted.

581
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:58,835
Mother, what have you decided
about Nature club I told you yesterday?

582
00:33:59,585 --> 00:34:01,585
I said No yesterday itself.

583
00:34:01,793 --> 00:34:04,501
Father, see what she says.
It's too bad.

584
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:05,460
What's the matter?

585
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:09,501
Nature club organizes a camp
at Thekkady next month.

586
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,251
Hundreds of students from different
colleges and schools are participating

587
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,418
Only two students are selected
from our school.

588
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,710
I'm one of them.

589
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:19,335
What are you gaining from Nature club?

590
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:21,626
In that time, you can sit and
study something useful.

591
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,126
Father, see what she says.

592
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:29,251
True knowledge is not the one
gained only from text books.

593
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:32,168
India belongs to Crores of people
who are affected by leprosy,

594
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:34,210
hunger-struck, Pimps and illiterates

595
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:38,876
When only touching that biggest India's
soul will gain some practical experience

596
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,918
Is the real knowledge.

597
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:42,543
Unwise people like
you who failed 10th grade,

598
00:34:42,543 --> 00:34:43,376
should possess some sense
to understand it.

599
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:44,793
Should possess some sensibility.

600
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,001
You should need sensitivity too

601
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,251
Superb father.

602
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:52,085
Okay, as you've sense,
send her for the camp.

603
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:55,043
But also give her Rs.1800 as fees.

604
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,668
Jeez!

605
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:05,335
Father!
Is there any benefit in this?

606
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:07,626
Don't talk like this! OK!

607
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:10,668
Haven't you people started?

608
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:13,168
Go quickly.
Shouldn't you reach school on time?

609
00:35:18,793 --> 00:35:21,335
Don't play mischief
in children's presence.

610
00:35:21,876 --> 00:35:23,376
Anju is matured enough
to understand things.

611
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:25,668
No, she hasn't understood anything.

612
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,585
Actually I wasn't aware of
all this when I was her age.

613
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:31,626
You talk as if you are
aware of many things now.

614
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:12,543
The rainbow will hold up the umbrella,

615
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:22,876
Giving shade to the heart

616
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:30,043
With play, laughter, stories

617
00:36:30,293 --> 00:36:34,335
And the sweetness of mischief

618
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:38,918
Are a mother-bird and two young ones

619
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,251
The rainbow will hold up the umbrella,

620
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:48,501
Giving shade to the heart

621
00:37:10,668 --> 00:37:19,085
I can't see them to my heart's content

622
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:23,585
These dear ones, full of merriment

623
00:37:23,585 --> 00:37:28,460
Wearing the shining golden
rays on forehead,

624
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:37,710
With the flapping of wings made
only by laughter.

625
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:45,918
Rain of coquetry showered by memories.

626
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:50,668
In my heart beats honey
scatters and spreads.

627
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:55,210
The rainbow will hold up the umbrella,

628
00:37:55,501 --> 00:38:01,418
Giving shade to the heart

629
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:26,293
Rain will come again and again,

630
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:31,126
Sunshine and snow will come.

631
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:34,793
The male bird croons

632
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:40,210
Come near, come near

633
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:45,001
Without swaying in the wind

634
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:49,376
to be together

635
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:54,210
Isn't there a lovely nest

636
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:57,585
Strung with the threads of love

637
00:38:58,043 --> 00:39:02,168
Am I not with you always?

638
00:39:02,751 --> 00:39:07,043
The rainbow will hold up the umbrella,

639
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:17,293
Giving shade to the heart

640
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,918
With play, laughter, stories

641
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,543
And the sweetness of mischief

642
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:33,876
Are a mother-bird and two young ones

643
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:38,210
The rainbow will hold up the umbrella,

644
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:43,668
Giving shade to the heart

645
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:52,418
I got this Idyappam
maker for you mother.

646
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:55,418
Why did you buy this?
I already have one here.

647
00:39:55,418 --> 00:39:56,710
That's old type.

648
00:39:57,085 --> 00:40:00,293
But we've not made idyappam since years.

649
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,251
What's it Georgekutty?

650
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:09,126
A small joke.

651
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:11,168
She really didn't get it for you.

652
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:13,793
No, it's for her only.

653
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,001
I stopped her from buying.

654
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:17,585
Already 3 similar makers are at home.

655
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:19,210
Not similar ones.

656
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,876
Must be a different type if not similar.

657
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:25,960
Irony is that we've not made
Idyappam last year.

658
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:27,835
Don't lie George kutty.

659
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:29,751
We made it once last year.

660
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:32,668
Three makers for making once in a year!

661
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:34,251
How can you expect me to be quiet?

662
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:35,418
And was adamant in getting another one.

663
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:41,126
In fact it's the nature of women.

664
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,668
Even her mother is no way less than her.

665
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:48,626
Wherever she goes,

666
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:50,085
she comes back with earthen fish pot.

667
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:52,876
Another one too.

668
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:55,043
Milk boiling Vessel!

669
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:57,210
Gets vessels for boiling
milk for 2 members,

670
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,793
then a separate one for 3 members,

671
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:01,168
One with whistle blowing and other one
without whistle blowing,

672
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:02,543
There are many such vessels here.

673
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:05,376
We ladies will take care of kitchen,

674
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,126
You people needn't bother.

675
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:10,501
Brother-in-law,
it's long time since I saw you.

676
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,501
I often come here but
only you wouldn't be seen here Rajesh.

677
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:15,585
We ourselves don't see each other.

678
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,293
He's the prominent Leader of
Ruling party now.

679
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:21,376
What's that in your hand? Manifesto?!

680
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:22,335
No, notice!

681
00:41:24,668 --> 00:41:28,460
Mullassery Rock Quarry
which is about to resume

682
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:33,376
to be banned for being
a threat to the village

683
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:35,835
What's this about?

684
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:40,335
Around 15 kms from here, there's
a quarry works in Mullasery village

685
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,751
Government has deterred the functioning
of Quarry for timebeing.

686
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:46,668
Now the owner is trying hard to resume
its function through Court.

687
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:49,793
We are planning to organize a
mass peoples' rally against it.

688
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:52,335
Rajesh has become a
great social worker is it?

689
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:56,876
It's better to call him as
Good Politician rather social worker.

690
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:59,960
He and his friends were
running behind for

691
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,751
the approval of functioning
of Rock Quarry.

692
00:42:02,293 --> 00:42:05,376
After the function of Rock Quarry,
18 months later,

693
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:09,210
a personal feud arose between
quarry owner and the MLA here.

694
00:42:09,835 --> 00:42:11,835
And they themselves hindered
the functioning

695
00:42:11,835 --> 00:42:13,168
stating environmental issues.

696
00:42:13,418 --> 00:42:16,835
What else could that pathetic owner do
there after investing huge money?

697
00:42:17,126 --> 00:42:18,710
Can't he do fish farming?

698
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,418
Fish farming in Rock Quarry!

699
00:42:21,293 --> 00:42:23,835
At the middle of that quarry,
there is a deep big pond.

700
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:25,751
He can do fish farming there.

701
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,168
That's Rajesh.

702
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:29,918
Your father is right! Rajesh,
you've a good political future.

703
00:42:35,043 --> 00:42:37,751
She wishes,

704
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:41,043
to move children to
St. Joseph Public School.

705
00:42:44,626 --> 00:42:48,585
Educating children in a very good school
is an essential thing nowadays.

706
00:42:49,085 --> 00:42:51,668
It's a very reputed school Georgekutty.

707
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:54,251
Yes, but already they are in
English medium school.

708
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:56,210
I don't understand what's wrong
with that school.

709
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,793
St. Joseph school has 100% results
since last 15 yrs

710
00:43:01,001 --> 00:43:02,668
This time also no 100% results
for their school.

711
00:43:02,668 --> 00:43:04,918
But our school had 2 ranks this time.

712
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:07,793
See, problem is not with the school.

713
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,918
Two children who weren't good
at academics, failed.

714
00:43:09,918 --> 00:43:11,001
What's the mistake of the school?

715
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:15,418
It's a disease of all Parents
of this generation,

716
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:19,251
to send children to School with fame,
pride and high fees,

717
00:43:19,251 --> 00:43:20,918
and talk of its greatness.

718
00:43:21,168 --> 00:43:22,168
She's also affected by that.

719
00:43:24,376 --> 00:43:26,085
Brilliant children will study in
whichever school they are.

720
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:30,210
- Am I right?
- Yes you are right

721
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,418
You're not ready to invest money in it,
that's why.

722
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:38,043
In that case, I could've got them
admitted in Government school.

723
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:39,751
Did I do so? I didn't, right?

724
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,043
I've got them admitted in English medium
school which has necessary facilities.

725
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:46,001
I've no money to show off before others.

726
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:49,043
You have your own justification
for whatever I say.

727
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,501
In this generation, we'll have to
show off and live before others.

728
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:53,210
Only then we'll have some respect.

729
00:43:54,251 --> 00:43:55,585
Be a Roman while you are in Rome.

730
00:43:55,835 --> 00:43:57,251
George kutty isn't
aware of all such things.

731
00:43:57,751 --> 00:43:59,751
Immediately she'll come up with this
proverb for whatever I say.

732
00:44:02,418 --> 00:44:04,210
If you wish me to be like others,

733
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,918
Then I should've taken dowry
for marrying you.

734
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:20,376
Father, why all this?

735
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:24,460
Good robust bananas!
Children may like it.

736
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,793
They don't need it!

737
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:28,960
That's why I sell out bananas
ripening in our field.

738
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,626
Doesn't matter.
Similar thing happens here also.

739
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:33,418
How much can both of us eat?

740
00:44:33,668 --> 00:44:34,918
We normally sell it out here.

741
00:44:34,918 --> 00:44:38,585
- Are you about to leave?
- Yes! Why?

742
00:44:39,085 --> 00:44:43,085
Certain things which I couldn't
afford to offer at your wedding,

743
00:44:43,085 --> 00:44:44,835
Do you mean about the dowry?

744
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,376
I just spoke of it to win over her
in argument. Have you taken it to heart?

745
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:49,751
No, never.

746
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,626
Still George kutty,

747
00:44:51,626 --> 00:44:56,001
I had come up with this proposal
since I liked Rani.

748
00:44:56,501 --> 00:44:59,126
Due to some financial loss
in the business,

749
00:44:59,126 --> 00:45:01,335
you weren't in a position
to conduct a marriage,

750
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:02,418
Saying that you rejected my proposal.

751
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,543
When I pestered you several times saying
Rani is enough for me and not dowry,

752
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:07,501
Finally you agreed.

753
00:45:08,501 --> 00:45:10,918
Actually I was benefited
from this marriage.

754
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:14,085
Being an orphan, I got a father,
mother and a brother.

755
00:45:14,085 --> 00:45:15,460
You may be right.

756
00:45:15,876 --> 00:45:18,418
According to us,
you're not only Rani's husband,

757
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,876
but like an elder son to this family.

758
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:25,168
We're happy to see that son
growing with hard work.

759
00:45:25,543 --> 00:45:29,043
We doubt that you are taking too much
of difficulties and hard work

760
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:33,043
But feel that you've forgotten to live
in the midst of hard work.

761
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:35,751
If you pointing out this
because of my stinginess,

762
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:36,710
There's also a reason for that.

763
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:37,585
I too know it.

764
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,876
You wish to buy that theater.

765
00:45:39,876 --> 00:45:41,626
Rani must've told you!
She's really sickening!

766
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:43,293
What's wrong in telling?

767
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:44,960
Shouldn't a father be aware of
son's difficulties?

768
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,043
I don't have any difficulties.

769
00:45:46,293 --> 00:45:47,876
I've saved some money.

770
00:45:47,876 --> 00:45:49,585
And If I approach for a bank loan,

771
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:51,835
Be careful when you take loan from Bank.

772
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:55,335
I'm the man who lost in business
taking loan from bank.

773
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:58,335
So you please don't
approach for a bank loan.

774
00:45:59,085 --> 00:46:00,085
No that's,

775
00:46:00,085 --> 00:46:01,835
Please obey this father's words.

776
00:46:02,335 --> 00:46:06,085
We middle class farmers won't have
too much cash in hand.

777
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,085
A little away from here,
there's 1.5 acres of rubber estate

778
00:46:09,085 --> 00:46:10,126
on the river bank.

779
00:46:10,626 --> 00:46:13,335
I can't go there and
look after the Agriculture

780
00:46:13,793 --> 00:46:15,876
Moreover Rajesh is in Politics.

781
00:46:16,293 --> 00:46:18,460
A rubber tapper which lies useless here,

782
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,043
Many times, I thought of selling it.

783
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,501
I will give it in your name.

784
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,293
What is this father

785
00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:27,376
It's not my sole decision.

786
00:46:27,668 --> 00:46:30,376
It's decided by me, Tracy and Rajesh.

787
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:34,126
You always win over us with your love.

788
00:46:34,543 --> 00:46:37,210
Let us also win at times.

789
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:55,460
What are you thinking of?

790
00:46:58,085 --> 00:47:01,376
You shouldn't have told your father
about purchasing the theater.

791
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:06,751
Oh my dear Georgekutty! They are not
offering this just because I said.

792
00:47:07,585 --> 00:47:11,543
They are worried that they've not
offered us anything since our marriage.

793
00:47:12,876 --> 00:47:13,876
Shall I ask you something?

794
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:15,543
When we marry off our daughters,

795
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,751
Even if grooms deny dowry,

796
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,793
Won't we give them
what we ought to give?

797
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,876
This is also similar to that.

798
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:26,335
I feel that I am getting more than
what I deserve.

799
00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:29,835
Nothing like that Georgekutty.

800
00:47:33,043 --> 00:47:36,293
Our life is going to be as bright as
that full moon.

801
00:47:37,543 --> 00:47:39,835
Let's buy the theater
selling this property.

802
00:47:40,501 --> 00:47:42,835
Appoint a Manager for Cable T.V.

803
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,001
And you could walk proudly
like a theater owner.

804
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:49,710
It'll not work out if I appoint somebody
else. I myself have to take care of it.

805
00:47:50,293 --> 00:47:51,210
You're not going to reform.

806
00:47:51,626 --> 00:47:54,460
When the country runs,
you should run in the middle.

807
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,335
You always have time only to
think about running.

808
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,876
Okay you run for sometime on that road.

809
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,626
I'm going to sleep.

810
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:02,710
You'll not reform
how much ever I advise.

811
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:18,960
Georgekutty, your tea.

812
00:48:27,585 --> 00:48:30,918
Will you agree if I say something?

813
00:48:31,168 --> 00:48:31,751
What's it?

814
00:48:32,335 --> 00:48:33,376
Tell me whether you agree or not.

815
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:35,710
Tell me what it is,
then I'll think it over.

816
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:40,126
What's this?

817
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:40,876
Read it.

818
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:46,835
A Divine family retreat
in Thoddupuzha Church!

819
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:54,835
On Saturday,
2nd August from 8.30 a.m to 6.30 p.m

820
00:48:55,376 --> 00:48:56,960
It's my long time wish.

821
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,376
To be take part in
Kachara Palli Father's divine retreat

822
00:48:59,918 --> 00:49:01,835
- Shall we attend?
- I can't attend.

823
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,043
If you really insist,
then take children and go.

824
00:49:04,543 --> 00:49:06,126
No, we don't wish to go alone.

825
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,543
Divine family retreat means,

826
00:49:07,793 --> 00:49:09,751
All members in a
family should take part.

827
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:12,668
Father, I've a doubt.

828
00:49:13,085 --> 00:49:14,460
Why hurtle today?

829
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:17,835
How can your father know when
he never reads papers?

830
00:49:18,126 --> 00:49:19,168
Because of Petrol price hike.

831
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:21,168
How did you know it,
without reading paper?

832
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,543
Those who have brains needn't
really read papers

833
00:49:26,335 --> 00:49:29,376
Due to petrol hike, you shouldn't
say that you won't buy Maruti car.

834
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:32,293
I feel as though
you've lost trust in me.

835
00:49:32,293 --> 00:49:33,835
It's because it's you father.

836
00:49:34,543 --> 00:49:35,626
You don't worry about it.

837
00:49:35,918 --> 00:49:38,626
There's no connection between buying
a car and petrol price hike.

838
00:49:39,626 --> 00:49:41,335
Don't we have to put
petrol for a Maruti Car?

839
00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:43,751
Why petrol for a car parked in the shed?

840
00:49:47,543 --> 00:49:52,210
You took Rs.1800 and didn't tell me
anything about nature club camp?

841
00:49:52,418 --> 00:49:53,418
How was your camp?

842
00:49:53,793 --> 00:49:54,835
Fantastic!

843
00:49:55,043 --> 00:49:57,835
Students from many
parts of Kerala were there.

844
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,251
In the daytime, classes about the
importance of protecting the nature.

845
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,585
In the evening, music and dance.

846
00:50:05,918 --> 00:50:07,335
And then the Camp fire at night.

847
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:08,626
What's that?

848
00:50:08,835 --> 00:50:11,085
Your father didn't understand that,
you explain to him.

849
00:50:11,418 --> 00:50:12,418
Mother, have you understood?

850
00:50:14,376 --> 00:50:16,251
Haven't you seen people lighting
firewoods sitting around?

851
00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:18,085
That's called Camp fire.

852
00:50:18,335 --> 00:50:21,043
Playing different games and
singing sitting around.

853
00:50:21,043 --> 00:50:22,460
Did you perform anything?

854
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,751
I was asked to sing.

855
00:50:23,751 --> 00:50:24,918
English?

856
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:27,585
Oh no! Malayalam song!

857
00:50:28,043 --> 00:50:30,668
Haven't you learnt English songs?
You could have sung that.

858
00:50:32,043 --> 00:50:33,585
Few students sung English songs.

859
00:50:34,043 --> 00:50:35,293
It was really good.

860
00:50:35,876 --> 00:50:37,835
We can never beat them in song.

861
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,251
May be they're from St. Joseph's school.

862
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,293
No, they are not.

863
00:50:43,835 --> 00:50:45,168
They are almost similar to us.

864
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:52,210
They are students from some
reputed school in Ernakulam.

865
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,876
They always communicate only in English.

866
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:58,626
All are from reputed family.
One is Judge's son.

867
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:01,460
Don't we often see a
Flat Advertisement on T.V?

868
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,876
That flat owner's son..

869
00:51:04,126 --> 00:51:05,251
And one is IG's son.

870
00:51:06,168 --> 00:51:07,251
He's a rogue.

871
00:51:08,085 --> 00:51:11,376
He always walks behind girls capturing
girls' photos and video's in his mobile.

872
00:51:11,793 --> 00:51:12,793
Did he take your photo?

873
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:13,751
Yes.

874
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:14,668
Why did you pose for him?

875
00:51:14,918 --> 00:51:16,751
I didn't, but he had taken my snap.

876
00:51:17,168 --> 00:51:18,585
You should've warned him.

877
00:51:19,626 --> 00:51:20,960
He'll never listen.

878
00:51:21,293 --> 00:51:22,668
When somebody complained against him,

879
00:51:22,918 --> 00:51:24,585
Sir shouted and made him stop that.

880
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:26,251
Haven't you come across in News papers,

881
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:29,626
how many girls have committed suicide
because of such photographs?

882
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:33,835
What could I do?
Why are you getting angry with me?

883
00:51:33,835 --> 00:51:35,543
You should strictly
tell him not to take.

884
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:38,085
What about the photos we take in
Studios and marriage halls?

885
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,960
Why have you become so foolish?

886
00:51:41,335 --> 00:51:43,168
That's taken from an ordinary camera.

887
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:47,126
But only nude photos
are taken on mobile.

888
00:51:49,293 --> 00:51:50,710
Father, see what mother says.

889
00:51:52,085 --> 00:51:53,668
Okay, that's how you've understood it?

890
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:55,085
Oh my dear mother!

891
00:51:55,085 --> 00:51:57,335
Photos taken on mobile are
also ordinary ones.

892
00:51:57,585 --> 00:51:59,585
It is then transferred to
Computer and modified.

893
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,335
You can change any photo

894
00:52:03,043 --> 00:52:06,418
Father, mother thinks
that she's always right.

895
00:52:06,626 --> 00:52:07,710
You don't take it seriously!

896
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:10,543
Just consider it as the arrogance
of a 10th failed fool.

897
00:52:10,751 --> 00:52:14,751
A 4th std passed intellectual
is with me... that's more than enough

898
00:52:24,043 --> 00:52:26,626
Foundation slipped down because of the
plaster of building has worn out.

899
00:52:27,335 --> 00:52:28,918
It's lying in this
condition since a long time.

900
00:52:28,918 --> 00:52:30,585
Couldn't get laborers
for such minor works.

901
00:52:30,918 --> 00:52:32,710
So I've not rented this room.

902
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:36,085
If you demolish it, then it would
require just one day's work.

903
00:52:36,668 --> 00:52:38,918
I will demolish it but you have to
provide me workers to build.

904
00:52:40,585 --> 00:52:42,126
Today, we're removing the
wooden planks from Concrete roof.

905
00:52:42,418 --> 00:52:44,210
Flooring work would begin from
Monday in Police station.

906
00:52:45,001 --> 00:52:46,376
After it's done,
we'll do it the next day.

907
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:48,085
- Isn't that okay?
- Yes.

908
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:50,335
I shall take leave.
It's time for evening tea.

909
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:51,418
I'll also come with you.

910
00:52:54,376 --> 00:52:55,876
Mr. Soma, please wait.

911
00:53:00,335 --> 00:53:02,126
How much do I owe you?

912
00:53:03,418 --> 00:53:05,710
I've eaten from your
money several times.

913
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:07,793
I thought of repaying that now.

914
00:53:08,335 --> 00:53:09,543
What did you think of?

915
00:53:09,876 --> 00:53:12,085
That S.I would take me to task
if you complain to him against me.

916
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:14,918
Don't try to displease me on
somebody's behest.

917
00:53:15,418 --> 00:53:17,793
I also give one share of the
commission to S.I.

918
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:20,335
So it's pointless to complain it to him.

919
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:22,835
It's good if you are good to me

920
00:53:23,126 --> 00:53:25,835
Otherwise, I'll put an end to
your project here.

921
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:29,043
We also
know S.I Suresh Babu quite well

922
00:53:29,335 --> 00:53:30,835
He'll not support you for all
such cheap activities.

923
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:32,168
What's itching you?

924
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:34,501
Yes of late, I've too much of itching.
I'll have to consult doctor.

925
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:35,543
Come then, I shall scratch it for you.

926
00:53:35,543 --> 00:53:38,126
Yes I know.
You'll do any odd jobs for money.

927
00:53:38,293 --> 00:53:39,210
Move away.

928
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,001
Georgekutty,
I'll get you one day in my hands.

929
00:53:42,293 --> 00:53:43,710
I'll settle my scores that clay.

930
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,043
Don't create trouble sir.

931
00:53:46,418 --> 00:53:49,293
Had come like a Tiger
and gone like a mouse.

932
00:53:49,543 --> 00:53:51,835
Why are you taking trouble for me?

933
00:53:51,835 --> 00:53:55,085
He's a Policeman.
You shouldn't have got his wrath.

934
00:53:55,585 --> 00:53:57,126
Why should I be afraid of Police?

935
00:53:57,751 --> 00:53:59,918
I've not flouted law till such time.

936
00:54:00,376 --> 00:54:02,043
And don't intend
to do it in future also.

937
00:54:03,251 --> 00:54:05,418
Give me one
One is enough.

938
00:54:05,418 --> 00:54:07,543
Listen to me. I'll go home and give you.

939
00:54:07,543 --> 00:54:08,793
I asked you to give.

940
00:54:09,126 --> 00:54:09,918
Wait, you'll get it from me.

941
00:54:23,043 --> 00:54:24,710
- Anju, is your house close by?
- Yes

942
00:54:24,918 --> 00:54:26,835
- You recognize?
- Varun?

943
00:54:27,126 --> 00:54:28,335
Lucky! You've not forgotten me?

944
00:54:28,668 --> 00:54:29,626
Why are you here?

945
00:54:29,835 --> 00:54:31,668
I actually came to see you.

946
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,085
Mother I'm hungry,
get me something to eat.

947
00:54:37,085 --> 00:54:38,126
I'll give you right now.

948
00:54:38,543 --> 00:54:41,043
- Have you purchased the items?
- Sister is coming behind with the items.

949
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:42,751
Flattened rice is there. Take it.

950
00:54:50,376 --> 00:54:51,376
Hasn't your sister come yet?

951
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:54,501
You told me that she
was coming behind you

952
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:57,626
We were together up
to Xavier uncle's house.

953
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:59,043
Then I ran and came home.

954
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,043
Where did she go?

955
00:55:10,168 --> 00:55:14,251
Mother, all that purchased from the
shop are in the room.

956
00:55:25,793 --> 00:55:26,710
Yes mother.

957
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:28,460
Anju, what are you doing inside?

958
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:30,126
How many times did I call you?

959
00:55:30,835 --> 00:55:31,960
Couldn't you respond me?

960
00:55:32,251 --> 00:55:34,043
May be she was listening
to songs from iPod.

961
00:55:35,835 --> 00:55:38,251
I've kept your coffee there.
Take it if you need.

962
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,418
She has frightened me unnecessarily.

963
00:55:49,376 --> 00:55:50,293
Don't get afraid.

964
00:55:50,293 --> 00:55:52,001
Nobody has seen this
video other than me.

965
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:52,918
And nobody would see it also.

966
00:55:53,543 --> 00:55:58,043
Not only that, I shall delete it
in front of you, okay?

967
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:04,043
But if you want me to delete it,
then you'll have to fulfill my wish.

968
00:56:06,085 --> 00:56:08,001
I've something to talk to you Anju.

969
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,126
I'll come to your
backyard at 11 tonight.

970
00:56:11,376 --> 00:56:12,293
Anju, you'll have to come out.

971
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:13,585
No, I won't come.

972
00:56:14,043 --> 00:56:17,168
I won't come.

973
00:56:17,585 --> 00:56:19,376
Shucks! Why are you crying for?

974
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,168
I've not come to trouble you.

975
00:56:21,751 --> 00:56:24,585
If I really want to do,
I can show this to my friends,

976
00:56:24,585 --> 00:56:26,460
Upload it in Internet. Did I do that?

977
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:29,126
Why? Because of the love I've for you.

978
00:56:29,835 --> 00:56:33,210
So as I said, you'll have to
come out tonight.

979
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,751
No, I will not.

980
00:56:35,335 --> 00:56:36,835
Tomorrow, if it comes in the Internet,

981
00:56:36,835 --> 00:56:40,543
I'll not be responsible for the
humiliation faced by you and your family

982
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,793
If you think,
you can solve this issue silently.

983
00:56:45,418 --> 00:56:49,001
If you try to inform your parents
or don't come out tonight,

984
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:53,001
No! I've hope that
you won't do like that.

985
00:56:53,668 --> 00:56:57,043
Please Varun! Please don't trouble me.

986
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,835
Okay then let's meet tonight at
11 pm at your backyard.

987
00:57:08,918 --> 00:57:13,168
Why are you lying down?
You didn't have coffee?

988
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:17,460
I don't need it.
Let me lie down for some time.

989
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,751
I've headache.

990
00:57:20,251 --> 00:57:23,293
How many times have I told you
not to hear songs through that iPod?

991
00:57:23,543 --> 00:57:24,918
That's why you have headache.

992
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:27,293
Shall I give you medicine?

993
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,960
No need mother.
Let me sleep for a while.

994
00:57:33,293 --> 00:57:34,876
Okay then you sleep.

995
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:42,085
Dear, why don't you take dinner?

996
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:43,751
You know what's the time now?

997
00:58:14,168 --> 00:58:16,876
Heavy rain! Will be in trouble?

998
00:58:17,751 --> 00:58:20,210
You shut up! Always talk nonsense!

999
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:22,960
Okay then I take leave.

1000
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,335
- You've an umbrella?
- Yes

1001
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,376
Then go.

1002
00:59:33,293 --> 00:59:34,626
Anju, You did a foolish thing.

1003
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,585
Still you didn't understand the
seriousness of it.

1004
00:59:37,168 --> 00:59:39,293
Doesn't matter!
You'll realize it immediately.

1005
00:59:39,626 --> 00:59:42,293
Varun please! Don't trouble me.

1006
00:59:42,293 --> 00:59:44,043
Actually I was not
interested to trouble you.

1007
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:45,543
But you ditched me.

1008
00:59:46,001 --> 00:59:46,835
You'll feel for it.

1009
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:48,626
Dean"

1010
00:59:50,168 --> 00:59:50,835
Dear..

1011
00:59:51,793 --> 00:59:55,543
We're Poor people!
We didn't disturb you in any way.

1012
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:58,126
Then why are you tormenting us?

1013
00:59:58,543 --> 01:00:00,335
Don't you have a mother and sister?

1014
01:00:01,376 --> 01:00:04,001
Don't destroy my daughter's life.

1015
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:07,210
It's not me who does it, but it's you.

1016
01:00:08,376 --> 01:00:09,335
You see this!

1017
01:00:14,876 --> 01:00:16,085
Just because you interfered,

1018
01:00:16,085 --> 01:00:18,293
Tomorrow the entire world
would see this in Internet.

1019
01:00:19,293 --> 01:00:21,626
Please don't let us down.

1020
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:25,085
Then the whole family has
to commit suicide.

1021
01:00:25,335 --> 01:00:27,001
Okay I shall delete it.

1022
01:00:27,543 --> 01:00:32,210
But in return,
I need your daughter for few minutes.

1023
01:00:33,835 --> 01:00:36,126
No I won't permit.

1024
01:00:40,293 --> 01:00:41,210
Leave.

1025
01:00:46,918 --> 01:00:47,918
Dean

1026
01:00:55,668 --> 01:00:57,751
Don't destroy my daughter's life.

1027
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,001
Don't devastate our family.

1028
01:01:03,251 --> 01:01:05,251
Don't torment us.

1029
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:12,418
She's a young girl!
Don't ruin her future!

1030
01:01:17,626 --> 01:01:18,585
Please no.

1031
01:01:21,835 --> 01:01:24,043
Okay I won't ruin her future.

1032
01:01:26,918 --> 01:01:30,293
In return, it's enough
if you fulfill my wish.

1033
01:01:51,626 --> 01:01:54,460
Yuck! Who dirtied the floor?

1034
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,293
Father.

1035
01:02:17,085 --> 01:02:18,043
What happened?

1036
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:20,668
What happened?

1037
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:31,001
Tell me what happened.

1038
01:02:42,876 --> 01:02:46,751
In return, it's enough
if you fulfill my wish.

1039
01:03:39,085 --> 01:03:40,126
Dean

1040
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:46,543
Shucks! Varun?!

1041
01:03:47,376 --> 01:03:48,835
Mother.

1042
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:24,876
What happened?

1043
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,376
- Tell me.
- Phone is dead.

1044
01:04:28,668 --> 01:04:30,293
How else could we inform this to father?

1045
01:04:35,168 --> 01:04:36,751
Till dawn how are we..

1046
01:04:41,668 --> 01:04:42,751
Yes. You come.

1047
01:05:00,293 --> 01:05:01,335
Mother.

1048
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,043
Dear what happened?

1049
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,835
What shall we do now George kutty?

1050
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:38,918
I don't know.

1051
01:07:40,418 --> 01:07:42,168
My hands and legs are trembling.

1052
01:07:42,793 --> 01:07:46,960
Actually I was not so frightened
while burying him.

1053
01:07:47,668 --> 01:07:50,001
I somehow got the courage to do it.

1054
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:54,918
Was it a mistake that I buried him?

1055
01:07:55,876 --> 01:07:57,376
No, you were right!

1056
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,501
We needn't get so tensed
if we had informed Police.

1057
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:05,626
It was I.G's son who was killed.

1058
01:08:07,085 --> 01:08:08,335
They'll
ruin our family.

1059
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,585
Our daughter's future,

1060
01:08:13,418 --> 01:08:16,501
But I don't think
I can bear this tension.

1061
01:08:17,668 --> 01:08:18,668
You don't lose hope!

1062
01:08:19,668 --> 01:08:21,418
We've not harmed anybody deliberately.

1063
01:08:22,543 --> 01:08:26,918
I'll not let anybody ruin our family
which I brought up with hard work.

1064
01:08:27,918 --> 01:08:29,293
Nothing will happen to us.

1065
01:08:29,293 --> 01:08:33,001
Father, look here,
I got this from that room.

1066
01:08:33,251 --> 01:08:34,293
What's it?

1067
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:35,793
A car's key!

1068
01:08:36,293 --> 01:08:38,085
His car is parked somewhere around here.

1069
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:39,793
How do we find it out?

1070
01:08:41,001 --> 01:08:42,126
It's a yellow car.

1071
01:08:42,668 --> 01:08:43,835
Did you check that room properly?

1072
01:08:44,501 --> 01:08:45,293
Come.

1073
01:08:53,126 --> 01:08:54,501
Where did that guy
fall after being hurt?

1074
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:55,543
There!

1075
01:09:04,418 --> 01:09:05,543
What are you looking for?

1076
01:09:05,543 --> 01:09:06,335
Blood!

1077
01:09:07,418 --> 01:09:09,335
Not even a drop of blood has
oozed anywhere here.

1078
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:11,585
You said he hurt his head, right?

1079
01:09:13,418 --> 01:09:15,001
Perhaps there's no external injury.

1080
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:16,418
We've to clear all
these things from here.

1081
01:09:29,793 --> 01:09:30,668
Here is his Sim!

1082
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,376
He can use this number
and locate us easily.

1083
01:09:34,376 --> 01:09:36,710
Check area of travel of this Sim card.

1084
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,668
They can trace the..

1085
01:09:43,335 --> 01:09:45,210
We could
identify all the numbers,

1086
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:47,335
To trace the outer,
call duration is not enough.

1087
01:09:47,335 --> 01:09:49,251
Where was that second cell deactivated?

1088
01:09:59,043 --> 01:10:00,376
Based on the signal strength,

1089
01:10:00,585 --> 01:10:03,501
Location is just half
km within the radius.

1090
01:10:16,751 --> 01:10:17,793
Until I come back,

1091
01:10:18,418 --> 01:10:20,918
You people should neither
go out nor call anybody.

1092
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:24,751
Whoever sees from far,
should assume that nobody is at home.

1093
01:10:25,001 --> 01:10:25,751
You got me?

1094
01:10:25,751 --> 01:10:26,793
Where are you going Georgekutty?

1095
01:10:27,376 --> 01:10:30,126
I've to find out and
move the car quickly.

1096
01:10:30,876 --> 01:10:31,793
Come back quickly.

1097
01:10:32,126 --> 01:10:33,085
We're alone here.

1098
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:35,126
Don't panic! I'll return before night.

1099
01:10:36,335 --> 01:10:37,168
What's it dear?

1100
01:10:38,585 --> 01:10:39,710
This father is with you dear!

1101
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:40,876
Whatever it may be, tell me openly!

1102
01:10:42,376 --> 01:10:43,876
I'm afraid to go to jail.

1103
01:10:44,793 --> 01:10:47,543
You going to jail when
your father is alive?

1104
01:10:48,585 --> 01:10:49,585
That'll never happen.

1105
01:10:52,168 --> 01:10:53,335
This is your father's word!

1106
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,835
Enough of counting! Give me.

1107
01:11:41,418 --> 01:11:42,960
It's not sufficient Thomacha!

1108
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,043
Rs.300 is it?

1109
01:11:44,543 --> 01:11:48,001
It's 300 if concerned person is present
at home during passport verification,

1110
01:11:48,001 --> 01:11:48,876
otherwise double the amount.

1111
01:11:48,876 --> 01:11:50,501
As I went to Church on Sunday,

1112
01:11:50,501 --> 01:11:52,751
you can go to Church anytime you like.

1113
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:54,251
But Gulf isn't like that.

1114
01:11:57,793 --> 01:11:59,251
- How much is your amount?
- Rs.70.

1115
01:12:00,085 --> 01:12:02,335
Please don't squeeze the juice
of poor people! Let us also live.

1116
01:12:03,001 --> 01:12:03,668
You take Rs.50.That's enough.

1117
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,835
Okay then

1118
01:12:07,168 --> 01:12:08,043
What's that?

1119
01:12:25,376 --> 01:12:26,293
Isn't that Georgekutty?

1120
01:12:26,585 --> 01:12:27,418
I think so.

1121
01:12:27,835 --> 01:12:28,751
Did he change his vehicle?

1122
01:12:29,293 --> 01:12:30,126
Where does he stay?

1123
01:12:30,501 --> 01:12:32,543
One which you see there
is Georgekutty's land.

1124
01:12:54,835 --> 01:12:57,585
Hello! Yes Prabhakar!

1125
01:12:59,001 --> 01:13:02,501
There is no change! Board Meeting
will begin at sharp 12 noon.

1126
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:06,168
They are not like our Indians!
They are very prompt and punctual.

1127
01:13:07,835 --> 01:13:08,751
Okay. Okay.

1128
01:13:19,835 --> 01:13:22,835
The number you're trying to
reach is switched off!

1129
01:13:26,626 --> 01:13:27,918
Shucks! Where did this Varun go?

1130
01:13:27,918 --> 01:13:29,668
His mobile is always switched off.

1131
01:13:29,668 --> 01:13:31,501
He switches off the mobile just
because you call him often.

1132
01:13:31,751 --> 01:13:34,418
I've told you many times
not to disturb him.

1133
01:13:35,126 --> 01:13:37,501
Give him some freedom otherwise
he would turn rebel.

1134
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:39,001
I agree to your point.

1135
01:13:39,293 --> 01:13:41,543
Freedom is necessary. But there's
also a limit for that freedom.

1136
01:13:41,543 --> 01:13:43,585
In Varun's case, it's been exceeded.

1137
01:13:43,835 --> 01:13:46,585
Youngsters can easily get spoiled
if given too many comforts like,

1138
01:13:46,876 --> 01:13:49,710
Laptop, Internet connection,
Credit card, Car.

1139
01:13:50,376 --> 01:13:52,418
Why such comforts needed for a student?

1140
01:13:52,668 --> 01:13:54,251
You know how much was
his expense last month?

1141
01:13:54,251 --> 01:13:55,418
26000 Rs.

1142
01:13:55,418 --> 01:13:57,376
He purchased a
few dresses and shoes last month.

1143
01:13:57,376 --> 01:13:58,793
He showed me the bill. Then what?

1144
01:13:59,043 --> 01:14:02,460
He's taking advantage of your
blind love towards him,

1145
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,126
And I'm totally upset that
you couldn't even realize that.

1146
01:14:04,668 --> 01:14:05,751
I too saw that bill.

1147
01:14:05,751 --> 01:14:06,751
What was mentioned in that bill?

1148
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:08,960
6 pants,
6 shirts and two pairs of shoes.

1149
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,335
When I checked in his room,

1150
01:14:10,543 --> 01:14:13,168
I found only 2 pants, 2 shirts
and one pair of shoes.

1151
01:14:13,168 --> 01:14:14,335
That was a fake bill.

1152
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:15,751
What did he do with that money?

1153
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:17,126
He's committing some fraud.

1154
01:14:17,126 --> 01:14:18,835
So you checked his room again?

1155
01:14:18,835 --> 01:14:19,710
Yes.

1156
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:20,876
That's the reason he walked away.

1157
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:22,960
You don't give him any privacy.

1158
01:14:23,335 --> 01:14:24,960
That's why he hates you.

1159
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,543
Why children require
privacy between parents?

1160
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:29,751
Only those who intend to conceal
something needs privacy.

1161
01:14:29,751 --> 01:14:30,835
That's what you don't understand.

1162
01:14:31,251 --> 01:14:32,168
What a pity!

1163
01:15:17,126 --> 01:15:21,210
It's my long time wish to attend
Kachirapalli Father's Divine retreat.

1164
01:15:27,876 --> 01:15:29,168
Take your car.

1165
01:16:01,668 --> 01:16:02,543
What do you want sir?

1166
01:16:03,043 --> 01:16:04,085
A mobile phone.

1167
01:16:04,085 --> 01:16:04,668
New piece is it?

1168
01:16:04,668 --> 01:16:05,835
No second hand.

1169
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:09,543
It'll be better if I get a
full charged one.

1170
01:16:09,793 --> 01:16:11,585
Full charged one.

1171
01:16:12,043 --> 01:16:13,376
Check this sir.

1172
01:16:14,501 --> 01:16:15,418
How much does it cost?

1173
01:16:15,626 --> 01:16:16,751
900!

1174
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:21,835
Please put this SIM card!

1175
01:16:23,043 --> 01:16:24,668
No sir, absolutely not.

1176
01:16:25,626 --> 01:16:27,168
I'll go to Delhi by
this evening's flight.

1177
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:29,293
Just 2 days meeting.

1178
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,126
Okay Thank you sir.

1179
01:16:47,543 --> 01:16:49,876
Can you reduce its volume?

1180
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:47,918
There's a rock quarry in
Mulaserry village, just 15 kms away.

1181
01:19:51,126 --> 01:19:52,418
Wait here, I'll be back now.

1182
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:58,668
Oh you?! I thought
you wouldn't come today.

1183
01:19:59,126 --> 01:20:00,085
How is the collection?

1184
01:20:00,335 --> 01:20:02,835
Not bad! Moreover it's raining
for past 2 days.

1185
01:20:03,085 --> 01:20:04,168
Because of that, business is quite dim.

1186
01:20:07,085 --> 01:20:08,668
I won't be here tomorrow
and the day after.

1187
01:20:09,293 --> 01:20:10,626
You take care of the things here.

1188
01:20:11,126 --> 01:20:12,001
Where are you going?

1189
01:20:12,501 --> 01:20:13,710
I'm attending a Divine retreat.

1190
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:15,085
Divine retreat?!

1191
01:20:15,418 --> 01:20:17,751
It's a long time wish of Rani.

1192
01:20:18,126 --> 01:20:19,210
Only now I found time for it.

1193
01:20:26,085 --> 01:20:27,168
Okay then, see you.

1194
01:20:28,043 --> 01:20:31,376
Georgekutty chetta!
Do you've any problem?

1195
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:32,793
Why do you ask like that?

1196
01:20:32,793 --> 01:20:37,043
I can see some changes in your
behavior and character.

1197
01:20:37,293 --> 01:20:39,876
Now there's no change in my
behavior and character.

1198
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,751
On my return if I find
things helter-skelter,

1199
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:45,001
That time there'll
be changes as you said.

1200
01:20:45,293 --> 01:20:46,960
- Now it's okay.
- Now it's okay.

1201
01:21:13,085 --> 01:21:13,710
It's me.

1202
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:14,710
It's Father.

1203
01:21:23,793 --> 01:21:24,710
What happened?

1204
01:21:25,585 --> 01:21:27,168
Where were you for such a long time?

1205
01:21:27,168 --> 01:21:29,293
- We were terribly scared.
- Don't cry! Your father is back.

1206
01:21:29,293 --> 01:21:33,876
Father, you don't leave us and go alone.

1207
01:21:33,876 --> 01:21:34,668
No, I'll not.

1208
01:21:34,668 --> 01:21:36,251
What did you do with that car?

1209
01:21:36,251 --> 01:21:38,501
I've cleared it!
You don't be upset of that.

1210
01:21:38,501 --> 01:21:39,793
Where did you move the car to?

1211
01:21:40,585 --> 01:21:42,335
I want to bathe! Get my towel!

1212
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:03,418
Are you not tensed Georgekutty?

1213
01:22:03,793 --> 01:22:04,710
Why?

1214
01:22:04,918 --> 01:22:06,293
A youngster...

1215
01:22:07,043 --> 01:22:08,543
No youngster had come here.

1216
01:22:08,793 --> 01:22:10,376
And we've not met any youngster.

1217
01:22:11,418 --> 01:22:14,126
- But Varun,
- Who's Varun?

1218
01:22:15,126 --> 01:22:16,710
I've never heard about such a person.

1219
01:22:18,085 --> 01:22:20,210
Hereafter we'll have to react this way.

1220
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:23,043
Fear and Tension will land us in danger.

1221
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:25,085
I just understood it sometimes back.

1222
01:22:26,085 --> 01:22:27,418
I came here after going to office.

1223
01:22:28,001 --> 01:22:30,460
On seeing me, Monichan asked me
if I've any problem

1224
01:22:32,376 --> 01:22:36,210
When a young boy could make out
the changes in my face,

1225
01:22:37,043 --> 01:22:38,710
What about others then?

1226
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:40,835
Did he doubt you?

1227
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:42,626
He sniffed that there's some problem.

1228
01:22:43,168 --> 01:22:44,793
But when I reacted normally,

1229
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:46,585
his doubt disappeared.

1230
01:22:47,001 --> 01:22:48,335
So bygones are bygones.

1231
01:22:48,835 --> 01:22:50,335
Behave as normal!

1232
01:22:51,626 --> 01:22:53,126
Father, what did you do to that car?

1233
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:57,543
Hereafter, there are many things
which you should know and know not

1234
01:22:58,043 --> 01:22:59,210
Things which you should know,

1235
01:22:59,418 --> 01:23:01,626
You have to understand it
and act accordingly.

1236
01:23:02,001 --> 01:23:04,335
Don't try to know about the things
which you're not supposed to know.

1237
01:23:06,793 --> 01:23:09,085
Get ready for a journey
tomorrow morning.

1238
01:23:09,668 --> 01:23:10,418
To where?

1239
01:23:11,043 --> 01:23:12,418
We have to keep aloof for two days!

1240
01:23:13,376 --> 01:23:14,668
You can also heave
a sigh of relief then.

1241
01:23:15,001 --> 01:23:18,210
If anybody asks you, tell them that
we're going for a Divine Retreat.

1242
01:23:19,418 --> 01:23:20,960
But the Divine retreat
was over yesterday.

1243
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:32,210
Are you on a long journey
with your family?

1244
01:23:32,418 --> 01:23:33,751
Have you purchased this new bus?

1245
01:23:33,751 --> 01:23:37,585
Not a new one!
A second hand one but not too old.

1246
01:23:37,918 --> 01:23:39,001
Where are you going?

1247
01:23:39,001 --> 01:23:40,460
For a Divine Retreat in Thoddupuzha.

1248
01:23:41,251 --> 01:23:43,668
What's this Georgekutty?
You keep the money inside.

1249
01:23:44,376 --> 01:23:46,751
Is it fair to ask you to buy the
ticket in my own bus?

1250
01:23:49,126 --> 01:23:50,501
Ticket.

1251
01:24:17,918 --> 01:24:31,293
Shade, shade, where are you?

1252
01:24:31,835 --> 01:24:45,085
Shade, you are far away

1253
01:24:45,918 --> 01:24:59,251
In the veil of darkness, are you near?

1254
01:24:59,835 --> 01:25:12,793
Are you not with us on the way?

1255
01:25:52,418 --> 01:26:01,960
Will it clear during the day
Or on the lap of the moon?

1256
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,626
Or will the story continue?

1257
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:18,168
Will it clear during the day
Or on the lap of the moon?

1258
01:26:20,293 --> 01:26:25,835
Or will the story continue?

1259
01:26:27,835 --> 01:26:31,043
Unbidden, my grief accompanies me

1260
01:26:31,293 --> 01:26:40,710
Did you search for unknown shores
Do my sorrow and tears follow

1261
01:26:41,085 --> 01:26:52,210
like a shadow even to the shore you go
Shade, Shade, where are you?

1262
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:06,293
What's this Rani?
How many times did I tell you?

1263
01:27:07,168 --> 01:27:11,376
I am trying to forget it... but I am not
able to George Kutty And never can I.

1264
01:27:11,585 --> 01:27:13,460
You have to and You must forget it.

1265
01:27:14,085 --> 01:27:16,668
To prove this incident, the Police has
only one evidence and that is

1266
01:27:17,001 --> 01:27:18,126
our Fear.

1267
01:27:19,085 --> 01:27:21,460
I am trying hard to save our family
from being ruined.

1268
01:27:21,918 --> 01:27:23,876
So, please trust me and stand by me.

1269
01:27:25,335 --> 01:27:26,835
One more thing.

1270
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:30,418
Get bills for all purchases
we make from today.

1271
01:27:30,418 --> 01:27:33,251
Like meat, fish, vegetables,
books, pencil or whatever..

1272
01:27:35,085 --> 01:27:48,001
Shade, Shade, where are you?

1273
01:27:52,043 --> 01:27:53,126
Connect me to Cyber cell.

1274
01:28:50,543 --> 01:28:55,293
Whatever I spot in the eyes

1275
01:28:57,501 --> 01:29:02,626
Is it the truth or made up stories

1276
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:16,793
Whatever I spot in the eyes

1277
01:29:18,376 --> 01:29:24,001
Is it the truth or made up stories

1278
01:29:26,043 --> 01:29:33,001
When you searched for the unknown,

1279
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:39,210
You saw scenes of reality

1280
01:29:40,376 --> 01:29:43,585
Am I no longer myself?

1281
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,585
Even when I stood by you,

1282
01:29:47,626 --> 01:29:50,293
Was I unaware of it?

1283
01:29:54,293 --> 01:29:56,751
Madam, Varun's phone signal,

1284
01:29:56,751 --> 01:29:59,293
travels from Kerala to Mangalapuram,
then Udupi via Goa,

1285
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:01,418
it reached Kolhapur, near
Pune and it indicates

1286
01:30:02,001 --> 01:30:04,085
J.P Powar Nagar in Kolhapur.

1287
01:30:04,376 --> 01:30:05,710
Actually that's an industrial area.

1288
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:07,626
His phone was switched off there.

1289
01:30:08,835 --> 01:30:10,460
He has friends in Goa and Mumbai.

1290
01:30:10,751 --> 01:30:13,751
He must have perhaps gone for a
bash with his friends.

1291
01:30:19,751 --> 01:30:33,043
Shade, shade, where are you?

1292
01:30:33,501 --> 01:30:46,543
Shade, you are far away

1293
01:30:47,501 --> 01:31:01,001
In the veil of darkness, are you near?

1294
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:14,418
Are you not with us on the way?

1295
01:31:33,293 --> 01:31:34,585
- Sir.
- Sir.

1296
01:31:35,626 --> 01:31:37,043
Don't worry. Only car was found.

1297
01:31:37,293 --> 01:31:38,376
Who saw the car?

1298
01:31:38,376 --> 01:31:39,918
Children who were bathing here saw it.

1299
01:31:50,918 --> 01:31:52,168
It seems it happened
a couple of days back

1300
01:31:52,168 --> 01:31:54,085
Yes madam! It might be
around 2 to 3 weeks.

1301
01:31:54,418 --> 01:31:56,460
Excuse me, did you search in this pond?

1302
01:31:56,793 --> 01:31:59,043
Yes sir. Nothing happened as you fear.

1303
01:32:00,293 --> 01:32:04,251
Don't give way for media and publicity,
please wrap it up.

1304
01:32:05,418 --> 01:32:08,251
Last call made from Varun's number,

1305
01:32:08,626 --> 01:32:11,751
was on August 2nd at 7.18 p.m,

1306
01:32:12,251 --> 01:32:15,293
to number 9645019578.

1307
01:32:15,793 --> 01:32:20,085
At that time, phone signal was
on Idukki, at Rajakadu near a Tower.

1308
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:23,876
Later by 10.15pm,
phone became out of coverage.

1309
01:32:25,085 --> 01:32:30,585
Again next morning phone was on
Thoddupuzha town's range at 9.20 a.m

1310
01:32:32,126 --> 01:32:36,001
Then again it was switched off
in Kolhapur near Mumbai.

1311
01:32:37,918 --> 01:32:40,293
Based on the details
we've collected now,

1312
01:32:40,585 --> 01:32:44,251
I think let's stop our inquiry
outside Kerala for time being.

1313
01:32:47,543 --> 01:32:50,626
Locate the details of the number
Varun spoke lastly.

1314
01:32:50,626 --> 01:32:51,543
Yes, madam.

1315
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:58,210
Ask him to come inside.

1316
01:33:03,126 --> 01:33:04,543
From the account number you gave

1317
01:33:04,543 --> 01:33:08,460
Cash was last withdrawn on
August 2nd at 10 a.m,

1318
01:33:09,085 --> 01:33:10,085
from an ATM at Thoddupuzha.

1319
01:33:11,043 --> 01:33:12,126
How much was the cash withdrawn?

1320
01:33:12,126 --> 01:33:13,043
Rs.20,000.

1321
01:33:13,543 --> 01:33:16,210
20000?!
Why does he require so much of cash?

1322
01:33:16,543 --> 01:33:18,043
Sir, I've a doubt.

1323
01:33:18,376 --> 01:33:20,210
The mobile which was
out of signal on 2nd,

1324
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:21,751
And the mobile which
regained signal on 3rd,

1325
01:33:21,751 --> 01:33:22,668
are two different mobiles.

1326
01:33:23,001 --> 01:33:24,376
Having two different IMEI numbers.

1327
01:33:25,585 --> 01:33:27,960
He might have withdrawn cash
to get a new mobile.

1328
01:33:28,876 --> 01:33:31,626
No. It's just three months since
Varun bought a new mobile.

1329
01:33:32,376 --> 01:33:34,001
So there is no possibility of
buying a new mobile.

1330
01:33:37,585 --> 01:33:41,585
Geetha, our son is in trouble.
Sir!

1331
01:33:49,835 --> 01:33:50,835
Sir.

1332
01:33:53,793 --> 01:33:55,585
Hey Monicha, what's this?

1333
01:33:56,835 --> 01:33:58,043
Panchayat Building Tax!

1334
01:33:58,043 --> 01:33:59,293
When did I ask you to pay it?

1335
01:33:59,293 --> 01:34:00,168
That's...

1336
01:34:00,168 --> 01:34:01,210
Already three weeks are over.

1337
01:34:01,543 --> 01:34:02,835
It's not 3 weeks!

1338
01:34:03,626 --> 01:34:06,418
Didn't I tell you the next day
I returned from Divine Retreat?

1339
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:09,835
This is Varun Prabhakar.

1340
01:34:10,668 --> 01:34:12,085
L.G Geetha Prabhakar's son.

1341
01:34:12,751 --> 01:34:13,710
This boy is missing.

1342
01:34:14,251 --> 01:34:18,210
Phone record indicates that he was
in our town on 2nd of August.

1343
01:34:20,543 --> 01:34:22,251
This was the car Varun had been using.

1344
01:34:22,585 --> 01:34:26,960
Maruthi Zen! KL7AA 1734

1345
01:34:27,543 --> 01:34:30,918
This car was recovered from Rock quarry
situated in Mullasery panchayath.

1346
01:35:05,168 --> 01:35:07,626
Thangaccha! Has your child
recovered from illness?

1347
01:35:07,626 --> 01:35:09,043
Feels better sir.
Child will get discharged tomorrow.

1348
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:10,376
Very lucky!

1349
01:35:10,793 --> 01:35:12,501
Stop. Give me Rs.100.

1350
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:13,501
I don't have sir.

1351
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:15,376
You would surely have money
because your child is at hospital.

1352
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:16,168
I don't have sir.

1353
01:35:16,168 --> 01:35:18,085
Look here.. Check this pocket.

1354
01:35:18,876 --> 01:35:20,335
I altogether have only this.

1355
01:35:20,585 --> 01:35:22,251
Rs.20?! Go.

1356
01:35:23,043 --> 01:35:24,460
Give me half packet of cigarette.

1357
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:25,876
Sahadeva, don't you like to have tea?

1358
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:30,876
No. I'm running behind a
complicated case.

1359
01:35:31,793 --> 01:35:32,585
Which case?

1360
01:35:33,793 --> 01:35:39,960
Yellow color Maruthi Zen was
recovered from Rock Quarry Pond.

1361
01:35:49,793 --> 01:35:50,835
Which Rock Quarry?

1362
01:35:51,168 --> 01:35:53,710
Near Thoddupuzha,
from Mullassery Village.

1363
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:55,335
How's it connected with policemen here?

1364
01:35:55,710 --> 01:35:56,918
Nothing in particular,

1365
01:35:57,210 --> 01:36:00,876
We were instructed from I.G office to
enquire if anybody knows about this car.

1366
01:36:01,085 --> 01:36:02,335
L.G can just sit and pass an order.

1367
01:36:03,293 --> 01:36:04,751
But it's we who suffer to find it out.

1368
01:36:05,335 --> 01:36:06,960
I and Mr. Madhavan are
in-charge of this inquiry.

1369
01:36:07,835 --> 01:36:08,835
See you then.

1370
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:22,043
What is this?
Quite unusual!

1371
01:36:25,043 --> 01:36:26,418
Oh no I just felt so.

1372
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:29,126
Sahadevan, you don't drag him
into this unnecessarily

1373
01:36:30,418 --> 01:36:32,126
Just because you have
personal grudges against Georgekutty,

1374
01:36:32,585 --> 01:36:33,543
you shouldn't do this.

1375
01:36:33,793 --> 01:36:37,501
I saw him taking that car,
with my own eyes.

1376
01:36:37,793 --> 01:36:41,251
Not only that, he was shocked
when I mentioned about the car now.

1377
01:36:43,793 --> 01:36:48,001
Just wait and see! If he has
fear inside, he will turn and see.

1378
01:37:01,835 --> 01:37:02,751
Now what happened?

1379
01:37:06,001 --> 01:37:08,501
How's Georgekutty connected
with I.G's son?

1380
01:37:08,501 --> 01:37:11,460
Sahadevan and George kutty
are not on good terms.

1381
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:15,001
Perhaps, Sahadevan,
making use of this opportunity

1382
01:37:15,001 --> 01:37:16,668
showing his anger on George kutty...

1383
01:37:17,043 --> 01:37:19,001
Otherwise it could
be a misunderstanding.

1384
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:23,543
Might have seen a person
resembling George kutty.

1385
01:37:23,918 --> 01:37:25,918
George kutty is really an
innocent fellow.

1386
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:28,960
I too know Georgekutty well.

1387
01:37:29,251 --> 01:37:32,043
But when Sahadevan is
so confident about it,

1388
01:37:34,210 --> 01:37:39,168
Sir, on 3rd of this month,
on a Sunday at 7.15 a.m,

1389
01:37:39,168 --> 01:37:41,918
I went to Irittathara Thomachhan's house
for passport verification.

1390
01:37:41,918 --> 01:37:43,126
I saw Georgekutty there.

1391
01:37:47,668 --> 01:37:48,793
Children come here.

1392
01:37:52,835 --> 01:37:56,335
This Saturday,
that was on 2nd of August,

1393
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:57,876
Where were you children?

1394
01:37:58,835 --> 01:38:00,793
We had gone to Thodupuzha for a
divine retreat.

1395
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:02,626
When did you return?

1396
01:38:06,043 --> 01:38:09,668
Next day, that was on Sunday.

1397
01:38:10,335 --> 01:38:11,293
At what time?

1398
01:38:12,793 --> 01:38:14,043
Around evening.

1399
01:38:15,543 --> 01:38:16,543
Where was it held?

1400
01:38:17,085 --> 01:38:18,168
In Thoddupuzha.

1401
01:38:19,835 --> 01:38:20,835
Where in Thoddupuzha?

1402
01:38:21,585 --> 01:38:24,793
- Para..
- In Paraipalli Church!

1403
01:38:24,793 --> 01:38:26,210
Retreat was at Paraipalli?

1404
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:30,876
Next to a hall near the Church.

1405
01:38:30,876 --> 01:38:32,835
Georgekutty, what's all this?

1406
01:38:33,918 --> 01:38:35,126
So Police will come, right?

1407
01:38:37,085 --> 01:38:38,001
They would surely come.

1408
01:38:42,751 --> 01:38:44,168
But not sure when they would come.

1409
01:38:44,626 --> 01:38:46,960
More the delay, more is the relief.

1410
01:38:47,751 --> 01:38:49,251
But don't get agonized.

1411
01:38:50,376 --> 01:38:51,376
Regarding that youngster,

1412
01:38:51,376 --> 01:38:54,043
they don't have a clear picture of
what happened to him.

1413
01:38:54,501 --> 01:38:55,960
They have no evidences too.

1414
01:38:57,085 --> 01:38:59,251
They'll try their
best to create evidences.

1415
01:38:59,501 --> 01:39:00,376
They may frighten you,

1416
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:01,918
they may even talk lovingly...

1417
01:39:02,626 --> 01:39:04,335
They may perhaps hit me or mother.

1418
01:39:07,251 --> 01:39:10,293
They will walk out silently
if they don't get any evidences.

1419
01:39:13,585 --> 01:39:15,251
For that we've to stand in unity.

1420
01:39:16,501 --> 01:39:20,585
Whatever happens,
we should stick to our statements.

1421
01:39:23,168 --> 01:39:24,418
Can I trust you children?

1422
01:39:29,251 --> 01:39:31,335
Will they hit you and mother brutally?

1423
01:39:32,293 --> 01:39:33,418
You don't worry about that.

1424
01:39:34,626 --> 01:39:36,876
When you do any mischief,
aren't we hitting you?,

1425
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:38,543
Just think that way.

1426
01:39:39,835 --> 01:39:42,501
Father, I'm terribly scared.

1427
01:39:43,918 --> 01:39:47,751
You don't have to be.
Go and sleep peacefully.

1428
01:39:49,126 --> 01:39:49,960
Go.

1429
01:40:01,126 --> 01:40:06,251
How can you prove that
we weren't here on Saturday?

1430
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:11,876
Somebody must've seen you at
your office and Sulaiman Ikka's hotel.

1431
01:40:12,126 --> 01:40:13,543
Yes somebody would've surely seen me.

1432
01:40:14,085 --> 01:40:17,501
Then how can we prove
that we weren't here?

1433
01:40:19,085 --> 01:40:22,543
An unexpected thing has happened
in our family.

1434
01:40:23,668 --> 01:40:24,835
There are only two ways in-front of us.

1435
01:40:25,918 --> 01:40:28,710
Strongly resist or
unconditional surrendering.

1436
01:40:29,876 --> 01:40:32,251
In our conscience,
as we are not guilty

1437
01:40:32,543 --> 01:40:34,501
My mind doesn't let me
surrender for no reasons.

1438
01:40:35,251 --> 01:40:36,918
So we are trying to resist.

1439
01:40:39,335 --> 01:40:40,543
It's an evasive game.

1440
01:40:41,251 --> 01:40:42,543
We may win or lose.

1441
01:40:43,126 --> 01:40:44,626
But I can assure you one thing.

1442
01:40:45,126 --> 01:40:48,335
You and my children won't be jailed.

1443
01:40:50,835 --> 01:40:53,085
It wasn't evident
that it was Georgekutty.

1444
01:40:54,085 --> 01:40:56,543
That day you also
admitted that you saw him.

1445
01:40:56,751 --> 01:41:00,085
When you asked whether
that was Georgekutty,

1446
01:41:00,085 --> 01:41:01,543
it was true that I also had a doubt.

1447
01:41:01,543 --> 01:41:03,460
But I can't admit this firmly

1448
01:41:03,918 --> 01:41:04,793
Did you see?

1449
01:41:04,793 --> 01:41:06,918
Even I didn't see clearly
whether it was Georgekutty chettan.

1450
01:41:07,293 --> 01:41:10,043
Like he said, I too had a doubt.
That's all.

1451
01:41:10,585 --> 01:41:11,751
Are you sure whether this was the car?

1452
01:41:12,085 --> 01:41:13,835
I saw a similar yellow car there

1453
01:41:14,126 --> 01:41:15,751
But not sure whether
it was the same car.

1454
01:41:16,043 --> 01:41:17,710
Do you have firmness in anything?

1455
01:41:19,251 --> 01:41:20,335
What do you say?

1456
01:41:20,335 --> 01:41:21,918
I didn't notice the number.

1457
01:41:21,918 --> 01:41:26,043
But I'm confident that
I saw a similar Yellow Maruthi Zen.

1458
01:41:26,251 --> 01:41:28,043
There are lots of Yellow Maruthi cars
in our place.

1459
01:41:28,251 --> 01:41:31,710
One Retired Professor stays
little further away.

1460
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:34,043
He also owns a yellow Maruthi Zen.

1461
01:41:34,043 --> 01:41:37,085
Yes right!
We would've perhaps seen his car.

1462
01:41:37,626 --> 01:41:39,501
We'll decide that.

1463
01:41:53,751 --> 01:41:55,793
- Any new fax message?
- Yes sir. From IG office.

1464
01:41:57,293 --> 01:42:00,376
In Nature club camp
which I.G's son participated last month,

1465
01:42:00,376 --> 01:42:02,751
Two students from here also participated
on behalf of St. Michaels

1466
01:42:02,751 --> 01:42:04,085
English medium school.

1467
01:42:04,085 --> 01:42:05,418
Their names and addresses
are given below.

1468
01:42:05,418 --> 01:42:07,960
One, Anju George is
Georgekutty's daughter.

1469
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:09,501
Didn't I already tell you sir?

1470
01:42:09,793 --> 01:42:10,460
Now see!

1471
01:42:11,043 --> 01:42:12,001
There's nothing to think about it.

1472
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:14,376
If you catch hold of Georgekutty
and give him hard blows,

1473
01:42:14,585 --> 01:42:15,501
he'll surely spill the beans.

1474
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:18,126
This news shouldn't get
leaked for any reasons.

1475
01:42:19,168 --> 01:42:21,501
- What's the time now?
- 11.30 am

1476
01:42:22,126 --> 01:42:24,085
- Teacher!
- Yes.

1477
01:42:27,251 --> 01:42:30,210
Anju, you're wanted by the Principal.

1478
01:42:41,293 --> 01:42:44,210
To prove this incident, the
Police has only one evidence and that.

1479
01:42:44,543 --> 01:42:49,001
Is our fear. So forget it and be cool.

1480
01:42:49,293 --> 01:42:51,835
Police are not aware of
what happened in our house.

1481
01:42:52,335 --> 01:42:56,126
With circumstantial evidences
and few lies, they'll approach us.

1482
01:42:56,376 --> 01:42:57,960
We've to respond them without fear.

1483
01:42:58,251 --> 01:43:01,043
Under any circumstances,
don't deny that you don't know Varun.

1484
01:43:01,835 --> 01:43:06,126
And hide only the incidents that
happened in our place.

1485
01:43:07,918 --> 01:43:10,501
- May I come in madam?
- Yes come in.

1486
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,751
Anju, this is S.I Suresh Babu.

1487
01:43:17,210 --> 01:43:19,210
He has something to ask you.

1488
01:43:21,668 --> 01:43:23,043
You're Georgekutty's daughter is it?

1489
01:43:23,043 --> 01:43:23,876
Yes.

1490
01:43:26,751 --> 01:43:32,710
- Do you know him?
- Isn't he Varun?

1491
01:43:34,251 --> 01:43:35,293
How do you know Varun?

1492
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:38,168
Nature Club organized
a State Camp last month.

1493
01:43:38,751 --> 01:43:40,210
I got to know him there.

1494
01:43:42,210 --> 01:43:44,335
Do you know anything else
about this Varun?

1495
01:43:45,543 --> 01:43:47,460
I know he's I.G's son.

1496
01:43:48,501 --> 01:43:49,793
Did Varun tell you?

1497
01:43:49,793 --> 01:43:52,585
No, I heard students gossiping.

1498
01:43:54,793 --> 01:43:58,210
Only acquaintance or beyond,

1499
01:43:58,543 --> 01:44:00,168
I just know him that's it.

1500
01:44:00,543 --> 01:44:03,793
He got to know me the way
he got to know others.

1501
01:44:03,793 --> 01:44:06,876
Then how could you remember him so well?

1502
01:44:07,210 --> 01:44:09,043
Varun was quite famous in the camp.

1503
01:44:09,751 --> 01:44:11,626
There were also certain issues.

1504
01:44:12,335 --> 01:44:13,168
What issues?

1505
01:44:13,918 --> 01:44:16,293
Varun was taking
photographs of everybody.

1506
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:19,960
When he photographed a
reputed lawyer's daughter,

1507
01:44:20,501 --> 01:44:21,876
She created a big issue.

1508
01:44:23,335 --> 01:44:26,585
After that camp,
have you seen Varun in your place?

1509
01:44:27,335 --> 01:44:28,085
No.

1510
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:30,293
What's the problem sir?

1511
01:44:30,293 --> 01:44:31,585
We were told that you had seen him.

1512
01:44:31,793 --> 01:44:33,710
Who told you? Varun?

1513
01:44:33,918 --> 01:44:35,126
Yes.

1514
01:44:35,876 --> 01:44:38,043
No sir, Varun is lying.

1515
01:44:38,293 --> 01:44:40,876
Did Varun, come to your house
on 2nd of this month?

1516
01:44:40,876 --> 01:44:42,626
To my house? No.

1517
01:44:45,126 --> 01:44:46,293
When was the day you said?

1518
01:44:46,501 --> 01:44:47,543
On the 2nd of this month.

1519
01:44:47,751 --> 01:44:51,293
That was on Saturday, 2nd August.
Now did you get me?

1520
01:44:51,293 --> 01:44:53,293
We weren't at home that day.

1521
01:44:55,251 --> 01:44:56,085
Where did you go?

1522
01:44:56,335 --> 01:44:59,001
There was a Divine Retreat in
Paraipalli at Thoddupuzha.

1523
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:00,418
We had gone to attend that.

1524
01:45:00,418 --> 01:45:03,001
- Who all had gone?
- My father, mother, sister and myself.

1525
01:45:03,793 --> 01:45:04,876
When did you return?

1526
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:06,668
Next day evening.

1527
01:45:07,335 --> 01:45:08,585
Was Divine Retreat for two days?

1528
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:11,710
No, it was one day retreat.

1529
01:45:12,085 --> 01:45:16,168
We stayed in a hotel and
returned only after watching a film.

1530
01:45:17,585 --> 01:45:18,751
What's the problem sir?

1531
01:45:20,668 --> 01:45:22,335
This young guy Varun is missing.

1532
01:45:22,876 --> 01:45:25,876
We also have proof that
he was in our town on 2nd.

1533
01:45:26,793 --> 01:45:29,335
As he was known to her, I just
wanted to check whether he met her.

1534
01:45:29,626 --> 01:45:32,085
No sir, I've not seen
Varun after the camp.

1535
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:34,501
- Okay thank you.
- You are welcome sir.

1536
01:45:34,918 --> 01:45:35,960
You can go to your class.

1537
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,126
- You are Georgekutty's wife, right?
- Yes.

1538
01:45:56,251 --> 01:45:58,293
It's quite unusual to see you
at home at this hour.

1539
01:45:58,293 --> 01:46:00,835
Principal informed her that
you had been to school.

1540
01:46:01,335 --> 01:46:02,710
She got scared and called me home.

1541
01:46:03,001 --> 01:46:04,626
When I went to the Station,
I was told you are here.

1542
01:46:04,626 --> 01:46:06,168
That's why I rushed here.
What's the problem sir?

1543
01:46:06,168 --> 01:46:08,043
- I came for an inquiry.
- Let's sit inside.

1544
01:46:15,376 --> 01:46:16,960
Georgekutty, you know this youngster?

1545
01:46:19,001 --> 01:46:20,126
No sir.

1546
01:46:20,501 --> 01:46:22,876
- You know him?
- No sir.

1547
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:26,835
Have you seen this car?

1548
01:46:28,376 --> 01:46:30,168
- No sir.
- You?

1549
01:46:31,793 --> 01:46:32,918
No.

1550
01:46:35,126 --> 01:46:37,543
Georgekutty, let's be open.
That'll be good for both of us.

1551
01:46:38,043 --> 01:46:39,460
That's what even I wish.

1552
01:46:39,751 --> 01:46:42,418
This young man in this photo,
Varun Prabhakar,

1553
01:46:42,418 --> 01:46:44,293
is the only son of I.G Geetha Prabhakar.

1554
01:46:45,168 --> 01:46:47,335
He's missing since last 25 days.

1555
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:49,668
During Nature Club's State Camp,

1556
01:46:50,085 --> 01:46:52,710
He got acquainted with
our elder daughter Anju.

1557
01:46:54,418 --> 01:46:58,460
We've proof that he had come to
our place by this Maruthi Zen.

1558
01:47:00,751 --> 01:47:04,960
Police recovered this car from the
quarry pond in the Mullassery last week.

1559
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,585
We had come here for 2 reasons.

1560
01:47:07,918 --> 01:47:10,710
One, your elder daughter knows Varun.

1561
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,001
Two, Sahadevan had seen you
driving that car.

1562
01:47:17,918 --> 01:47:21,210
You drove this car in front of
Irattikara Thomachhan's house.

1563
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:23,251
That day I was standing on
Thomachhan's frontyard,

1564
01:47:23,626 --> 01:47:25,293
for a passport verification.

1565
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:31,751
What we policemen came to
understand from this was,

1566
01:47:32,001 --> 01:47:34,335
that youngster had been to your house.

1567
01:47:34,335 --> 01:47:36,418
But we were not here on August 2nd.

1568
01:47:37,001 --> 01:47:39,251
We had gone for a retreat and
returned only on 3rd evening.

1569
01:47:41,668 --> 01:47:43,168
This is enough. Now everything is okay.

1570
01:47:43,585 --> 01:47:45,001
What other proof do you require?

1571
01:47:54,126 --> 01:47:55,626
Don't laugh Georgekutty.

1572
01:47:55,876 --> 01:47:57,376
We never mentioned about the
date that youngster came,

1573
01:47:57,376 --> 01:48:00,168
or the date you took the car.

1574
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:02,293
But your wife mentioned it
without we asking for it.

1575
01:48:07,501 --> 01:48:09,043
Georgekutty, why are you smirking at us?

1576
01:48:09,043 --> 01:48:11,001
You mean to say it's all absurd!

1577
01:48:11,001 --> 01:48:12,168
I don't smirk at anybody.

1578
01:48:13,418 --> 01:48:14,751
Why should we smirk at policemen?

1579
01:48:15,585 --> 01:48:18,918
She's still shocked!
She hasn't still understood anything.

1580
01:48:19,376 --> 01:48:22,293
Didn't I already tell you that
Principal phoned her?

1581
01:48:22,751 --> 01:48:25,335
Regarding a case,
you had gone to school,

1582
01:48:25,335 --> 01:48:28,168
called Anju and inquired her thoroughly.

1583
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:29,418
Principal informed her.

1584
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:31,876
You know the nature
of the present schools,

1585
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:34,460
If it is known that any student
is connected to any police case,

1586
01:48:34,918 --> 01:48:37,293
Schools tend to panic fearing that
may cause bad reputation to the school.

1587
01:48:37,668 --> 01:48:40,085
May be that was the
reason Principal called her,

1588
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:42,293
and inquired about
the details you asked.

1589
01:48:43,376 --> 01:48:44,668
She was totally nervous and called me.

1590
01:48:44,876 --> 01:48:46,460
That's how we learnt about these dates.

1591
01:48:50,501 --> 01:48:54,501
On August 3rd Sunday, Sahadevan
says that he had seen you but...,

1592
01:48:54,710 --> 01:48:55,960
You didn't give an answer.

1593
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,543
What's the point of me answering it?

1594
01:48:58,543 --> 01:48:59,418
Why?

1595
01:48:59,793 --> 01:49:02,293
Everybody knows the displeasure
between me and Sahadevan.

1596
01:49:02,293 --> 01:49:04,168
Whatever I say, Sahadevan will not agree

1597
01:49:05,085 --> 01:49:06,626
I'm not asking this
for Sahadevan's sake,

1598
01:49:06,835 --> 01:49:08,126
but I want to know the truth.

1599
01:49:08,501 --> 01:49:09,376
I shall tell you sir.

1600
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:11,460
If Sahadevan says that he had seen me,

1601
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:13,126
One - he must be lying,

1602
01:49:14,168 --> 01:49:15,835
or - it must be a mistaken identity.

1603
01:49:17,126 --> 01:49:20,251
Because on August 2nd,
Saturday since 8 am,

1604
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:23,460
till August 3rd, Sunday 5 pm

1605
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:25,376
I and my family were in Thoddupuzha.

1606
01:49:25,793 --> 01:49:28,543
No sir, I'm sure
that I've seen him only.

1607
01:49:30,293 --> 01:49:31,960
From 2nd when you left till 3rd,
the day you came back

1608
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:34,751
Can you tell me in detail
what all had happened?

1609
01:49:34,751 --> 01:49:35,751
I'll tell you Sir.

1610
01:49:35,751 --> 01:49:39,043
On the 2nd, we left by the
morning 5.30 bus.

1611
01:49:55,335 --> 01:49:57,001
Was it raining when you returned?

1612
01:49:57,335 --> 01:49:58,835
Yes sir, it was raining heavily.

1613
01:49:59,126 --> 01:50:01,626
Rani and children were drenched
in the rain, and got fever and cold too.

1614
01:50:01,876 --> 01:50:03,585
Children missed their
classes for 3-4 days.

1615
01:50:03,918 --> 01:50:06,793
Don't you think there's something fishy
about preserving the bills, Sir?

1616
01:50:07,085 --> 01:50:09,501
First time I'm coming across a man
keeping even the bus ticket safe.

1617
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:13,460
We belong to a middle class family
struggling to make both ends meet.

1618
01:50:14,043 --> 01:50:16,418
At the end of every month,
we total all the bills,

1619
01:50:16,418 --> 01:50:17,835
to find out the additional expenditure..

1620
01:50:18,751 --> 01:50:19,876
Okay then,

1621
01:50:20,251 --> 01:50:21,793
S.I sir has come. I'll call you later.

1622
01:50:23,085 --> 01:50:24,501
How many acres are there altogether?

1623
01:50:25,043 --> 01:50:26,043
5 acres, Sir.

1624
01:50:26,418 --> 01:50:27,293
See you then.

1625
01:50:37,251 --> 01:50:40,335
It was a blunder that
I mentioned about the dates. Yes!

1626
01:50:42,126 --> 01:50:44,460
Since you explained them in
detail along with proof,

1627
01:50:44,751 --> 01:50:47,001
They believed, didn't they
Georgekutty?

1628
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:54,043
According to the evidences
they produced,

1629
01:50:54,043 --> 01:50:55,501
whatever you told was nonsense.

1630
01:50:55,501 --> 01:50:57,126
I swear that I saw him.

1631
01:50:59,001 --> 01:51:01,001
If you give rough
treatment to Georgekutty,

1632
01:51:01,001 --> 01:51:01,960
he'll come out with truth.

1633
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,460
Anyhow let's inform I.G.

1634
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:08,501
Isn't it better, if we first nab him,
get evidences and then inform the IG?

1635
01:51:17,085 --> 01:51:18,001
Father.

1636
01:51:19,751 --> 01:51:22,460
Did Policemen trust our words?

1637
01:51:24,043 --> 01:51:24,960
I don't know dear.

1638
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:27,335
Will policemen come again?

1639
01:51:28,168 --> 01:51:29,001
They'll come dear.

1640
01:51:41,501 --> 01:51:43,460
- What's his name?
- George Kutty

1641
01:51:43,918 --> 01:51:46,751
Are you sure that he drove my son's car'?

1642
01:51:47,043 --> 01:51:48,126
I don't remember the number.

1643
01:51:48,418 --> 01:51:50,960
But I was sure that it
was yellow Maruthi Zen.

1644
01:51:51,251 --> 01:51:53,585
Are you sure that it was
Georgekutty who drove it?

1645
01:51:53,585 --> 01:51:54,918
Yes I'm very sure of it.

1646
01:51:55,168 --> 01:51:58,543
But they claim they were in
Thoddupuzha on 2nd and 3rd.

1647
01:51:58,751 --> 01:52:00,251
Sir, May be they're lying.

1648
01:52:00,251 --> 01:52:02,543
You also said that they've
shown you the proof for that.

1649
01:52:02,543 --> 01:52:05,293
It's true that he has shown us
hotel bills and bus ticket.

1650
01:52:05,293 --> 01:52:07,626
But not sure of its genuinely.

1651
01:52:07,626 --> 01:52:09,293
If this person is telling the truth,

1652
01:52:09,626 --> 01:52:11,793
Then George Kutty's story's
evidences are fake.

1653
01:52:12,168 --> 01:52:14,293
That'll not be a problem for us
to find it out.

1654
01:52:14,293 --> 01:52:16,585
After all he's an ordinary villager,

1655
01:52:16,585 --> 01:52:18,251
who doesn't even possess
a high school qualification.

1656
01:52:18,501 --> 01:52:21,626
We can guess the strength of his
manipulated evidences.

1657
01:52:21,876 --> 01:52:23,585
So Georgekutty,

1658
01:52:23,585 --> 01:52:25,626
his wife and all the evidences,
to be present here tomorrow.

1659
01:52:25,626 --> 01:52:26,585
Yes madam.

1660
01:52:26,793 --> 01:52:27,960
Don't bother about the protocol.

1661
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,793
You can leave,
I can take care of myself.

1662
01:52:37,168 --> 01:52:38,668
Why have you come early in the morning?

1663
01:52:38,668 --> 01:52:40,460
Police nabbed Georgekutty
and his family.

1664
01:52:40,876 --> 01:52:41,793
Good Lord!

1665
01:52:59,001 --> 01:53:01,376
We left at 5.30 a.m by a private bus.

1666
01:53:02,085 --> 01:53:04,168
Why don't you have
the ticket of that bus?

1667
01:53:05,751 --> 01:53:08,418
It was one of
Georgekutty's friend's bus.

1668
01:53:08,668 --> 01:53:10,335
He didn't allow us to buy a ticket.

1669
01:53:11,501 --> 01:53:13,335
When did you reach for the retreat?

1670
01:53:13,710 --> 01:53:15,085
It was almost 8.30 a.m

1671
01:53:15,085 --> 01:53:17,793
Divine Retreat started by the
time we reached.

1672
01:53:17,793 --> 01:53:19,168
It was almost 8.30 a.m

1673
01:53:19,585 --> 01:53:21,418
Divine Retreat was started
by the time we reached.

1674
01:53:21,835 --> 01:53:23,460
When did you reach
for the divine retreat?

1675
01:53:26,168 --> 01:53:29,460
We'll be in trouble if all of us
say the same thing.

1676
01:53:30,168 --> 01:53:31,418
For example, the time,

1677
01:53:32,168 --> 01:53:34,543
I and mother will tell the exact time.

1678
01:53:35,376 --> 01:53:38,085
But being children, it isn't necessary
that you should know the exact time.

1679
01:53:39,126 --> 01:53:40,626
I don't know the exact time.

1680
01:53:41,751 --> 01:53:43,835
Divine Retreat started
by the time we reached.

1681
01:53:45,126 --> 01:53:48,585
What time did the Divine retreat begin
after you reached there?

1682
01:53:50,043 --> 01:53:52,293
Police will twist
and shoot up questions.

1683
01:53:52,751 --> 01:53:56,835
So listen carefully to the
question and then answer.

1684
01:53:58,168 --> 01:54:00,293
Divine Retreat started by the
time we reached.

1685
01:54:01,626 --> 01:54:03,293
But your parents said that

1686
01:54:03,293 --> 01:54:06,043
retreat started in half an hour
after they reached.

1687
01:54:07,626 --> 01:54:10,043
Police will lie telling
father said this,

1688
01:54:10,293 --> 01:54:12,585
and mother said that.

1689
01:54:14,001 --> 01:54:17,710
Don't ever change your
statements hearing that.

1690
01:54:19,918 --> 01:54:23,168
No, retreat was started
by the time we reached.

1691
01:54:34,668 --> 01:54:35,835
Georgekutty isn't seen here.

1692
01:54:36,335 --> 01:54:38,168
They would've taken them inside.

1693
01:54:38,168 --> 01:54:39,043
They have reached.

1694
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:45,251
- What's the problem Sulaiman?
- I don't understand anything.

1695
01:54:45,585 --> 01:54:47,251
They are not letting us inside also.

1696
01:54:47,543 --> 01:54:48,918
We've to get inside.

1697
01:54:48,918 --> 01:54:50,376
Nobody is allowed now.

1698
01:54:50,376 --> 01:54:51,626
They're Georgekutty's in-laws.

1699
01:54:51,626 --> 01:54:53,793
I can't allow them whoever they may be

1700
01:54:53,793 --> 01:54:56,293
- How can you stop us?
- My son-in-law is in your custody.

1701
01:54:56,585 --> 01:54:58,168
Move away and stand.

1702
01:54:58,751 --> 01:55:00,085
Open the gate.

1703
01:55:00,335 --> 01:55:02,543
Oh my son Rajesh, no...

1704
01:55:09,043 --> 01:55:11,251
Later on we had food in a hotel.

1705
01:55:11,251 --> 01:55:12,293
Which hotel?

1706
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:15,668
I don't remember the name.

1707
01:55:15,668 --> 01:55:16,960
What food did you have?

1708
01:55:17,251 --> 01:55:18,001
Biriyani.

1709
01:55:18,501 --> 01:55:20,126
What did your father,
mother and sister have?

1710
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:22,335
They also had Biriyani.

1711
01:55:22,335 --> 01:55:24,835
Your sister said that
all of them had fried rice.

1712
01:55:27,001 --> 01:55:28,460
May be she would've forgotten.

1713
01:55:29,251 --> 01:55:30,710
All of us had biriyani.

1714
01:55:31,085 --> 01:55:32,251
I remember very well.

1715
01:55:41,126 --> 01:55:42,668
- Hello.
- Mr. Suresh.

1716
01:55:42,668 --> 01:55:45,376
Who said?
It's a rumor.

1717
01:55:46,168 --> 01:55:48,168
No, no... I'm in a meeting.

1718
01:55:48,710 --> 01:55:49,543
I'll get back.

1719
01:55:50,293 --> 01:55:51,710
Call is from Asianet news

1720
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:53,626
It seems they heard we've arrested
a family for interrogating

1721
01:55:53,626 --> 01:55:55,501
in connection to
our son's disappearance.

1722
01:55:56,126 --> 01:55:57,168
Just leave it.

1723
01:55:57,501 --> 01:55:59,293
Mr. Suresh, What do you think about it?

1724
01:55:59,293 --> 01:56:00,418
It's not as we thought.

1725
01:56:00,751 --> 01:56:01,585
They are very tough.

1726
01:56:01,585 --> 01:56:03,043
Not only their statements are one,

1727
01:56:03,043 --> 01:56:04,293
But also stand firm by it.

1728
01:56:04,543 --> 01:56:05,876
Particularly his second daughter.

1729
01:56:05,876 --> 01:56:07,835
To be honest, that child astounded me.

1730
01:56:08,126 --> 01:56:08,876
That's it.

1731
01:56:09,501 --> 01:56:11,293
Even that child is too strong
in her statement.

1732
01:56:11,710 --> 01:56:13,293
Don't you find something strange in it?

1733
01:56:13,543 --> 01:56:15,168
I too felt so from the beginning

1734
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:17,168
May be they're telling the truth.

1735
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:19,793
- And this man must've gone wrong.
- No no.

1736
01:56:20,376 --> 01:56:21,335
One thing is confirmed.

1737
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:23,835
They know something about Varun.

1738
01:56:24,168 --> 01:56:26,835
- But their statements are,
- it's a cooked up story.

1739
01:56:27,251 --> 01:56:28,835
A cleverly manipulated story!

1740
01:56:29,585 --> 01:56:30,793
But it won't sell here.

1741
01:56:31,043 --> 01:56:34,668
Since we came to
know that they're lying,

1742
01:56:35,001 --> 01:56:36,918
Why don't we go for
a lie-detection test?

1743
01:56:37,168 --> 01:56:39,085
Who made you a policeman?

1744
01:56:40,001 --> 01:56:42,126
It can't be done just like that.

1745
01:56:42,668 --> 01:56:44,085
You need a proper Court order for that.

1746
01:56:44,085 --> 01:56:45,793
In that case, let's get court order.

1747
01:56:46,043 --> 01:56:50,793
Court needs exact proof
to prove that accused is lying.

1748
01:56:51,418 --> 01:56:53,085
But here,
all evidences are favorable to them.

1749
01:56:54,501 --> 01:56:57,418
I've an idea to smash their fake story.

1750
01:56:58,293 --> 01:57:01,210
All the characters in their story
should be present here.

1751
01:57:02,376 --> 01:57:03,668
Suresh, do you get me?

1752
01:57:03,876 --> 01:57:04,626
Madam, I understood.

1753
01:57:05,793 --> 01:57:06,751
And one more thing.

1754
01:57:07,543 --> 01:57:10,793
In case he's lying that he had gone
for retreat on 2nd August,

1755
01:57:11,501 --> 01:57:13,293
Then he must've been in this town.

1756
01:57:13,668 --> 01:57:15,626
If so, wouldn't he
have gone to his office?

1757
01:57:15,626 --> 01:57:16,501
Of course.

1758
01:57:16,918 --> 01:57:20,085
Similarly, is there any other place
he regularly visits?

1759
01:57:20,085 --> 01:57:22,376
Yes, a hotel next to our Police station,

1760
01:57:22,376 --> 01:57:23,668
He consistently comes there. Very good!

1761
01:57:24,085 --> 01:57:24,876
Very good.

1762
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:28,251
Bring the office staff and
hotel owner immediately.

1763
01:57:28,543 --> 01:57:29,335
Yes madam.

1764
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:31,501
And one more thing.

1765
01:57:32,501 --> 01:57:36,585
They should leave from here
hoping that we believed their story.

1766
01:57:37,293 --> 01:57:38,585
- You get me?
- Yes madam.

1767
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:48,876
To be honest, I was nervously seated
before the policemen.

1768
01:57:50,126 --> 01:57:51,293
Anyhow God has protected us.

1769
01:57:52,210 --> 01:57:53,251
Everything has ended.

1770
01:57:54,835 --> 01:57:55,918
Rani,

1771
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:05,126
Nothing has ended.

1772
01:58:06,876 --> 01:58:07,918
They'll come here again.

1773
01:58:18,876 --> 01:58:20,543
They'll come again? For what?

1774
01:58:21,251 --> 01:58:22,793
Brother-in-law,
actually what's the problem?

1775
01:58:22,793 --> 01:58:24,085
At least be open to me.

1776
01:58:25,293 --> 01:58:29,001
All families would have
something personal to hide from others.

1777
01:58:30,376 --> 01:58:33,085
Rajesh, so please don't
ask me anything more.

1778
01:58:35,835 --> 01:58:39,126
Rajesh, I need your help.

1779
01:58:41,251 --> 01:58:42,210
What should I do?

1780
01:58:47,168 --> 01:58:50,626
I know Georgekutty since his childhood.

1781
01:58:51,126 --> 01:58:53,876
He's really an innocent.
Very innocent.

1782
01:58:53,876 --> 01:58:55,793
I never asked for
his conduct certificate.

1783
01:58:57,585 --> 01:58:59,501
Just answer only what is ask

1784
01:59:00,876 --> 01:59:04,043
On last 2nd, that's on August 2nd,

1785
01:59:04,043 --> 01:59:06,126
How many times did Georgekutty
come to your shop?

1786
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,960
He normally comes twice a day.

1787
01:59:09,585 --> 01:59:12,043
For evening tea and dinner.

1788
01:59:12,335 --> 01:59:14,293
Some days, he never comes for dinner.

1789
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:16,626
I can't say it exactly

1790
01:59:16,626 --> 01:59:19,335
You were asked how many times
he had been to your shop on 2nd?

1791
01:59:19,668 --> 01:59:23,251
He must have come twice on 2nd also.

1792
01:59:26,585 --> 01:59:29,085
Oh yes! No sir, I'm wrong.

1793
01:59:29,751 --> 01:59:32,001
Georgekutty wasn't here on 2nd.

1794
01:59:33,168 --> 01:59:36,293
He had was gone to attend a divine
retreat in a church in Thoddupuzha.

1795
01:59:36,626 --> 01:59:38,626
At first, you didn't tell this?

1796
01:59:38,626 --> 01:59:40,960
No sir, I suddenly remembered.

1797
01:59:41,376 --> 01:59:44,960
Georgekutty talked to me about
retreat last day also.

1798
01:59:45,210 --> 01:59:47,043
What did Georgekutty
tell you about retreat?

1799
01:59:47,543 --> 01:59:49,460
He told it was a very
good divine retreat.

1800
01:59:50,876 --> 01:59:53,793
He was telling us the stories
Father shared in his speech.

1801
01:59:54,251 --> 01:59:55,001
What stories?

1802
01:59:55,210 --> 01:59:59,335
A story of a king who subjugated it's
rival kingdom through love and patience.

1803
01:59:59,626 --> 02:00:01,710
When did Georgekutty
return from the retreat?

1804
02:00:02,085 --> 02:00:02,876
Next day.

1805
02:00:03,210 --> 02:00:04,335
At what time?

1806
02:00:04,626 --> 02:00:05,501
I don't know sir.

1807
02:00:06,085 --> 02:00:07,335
He didn't come to office that day.

1808
02:00:07,668 --> 02:00:10,501
Did he call you in
the middle of his journey?

1809
02:00:10,710 --> 02:00:12,501
Yes he called me on the morning,
on the day he left.

1810
02:00:12,501 --> 02:00:13,418
At what time?

1811
02:00:13,876 --> 02:00:15,835
Between 9 - 10 a.m.

1812
02:00:16,501 --> 02:00:18,293
How come you remember it so well?

1813
02:00:18,293 --> 02:00:20,793
Because I regularly
come to office at 9 a.m.

1814
02:00:21,043 --> 02:00:22,501
And then sweep and clean the office.

1815
02:00:22,501 --> 02:00:23,668
At that moment, I got his call.

1816
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:25,501
What did Georgekutty tell you?

1817
02:00:26,418 --> 02:00:29,335
He has asked me not to keep that day's
collection at office, but take it home.

1818
02:00:38,418 --> 02:00:40,960
- You know them?
- I know sir.

1819
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:43,376
Did they travel on your bus of late?

1820
02:00:43,626 --> 02:00:45,626
Yes, 4 or 5 days before.

1821
02:00:45,626 --> 02:00:48,251
When did they travel before that?

1822
02:00:48,251 --> 02:00:49,210
Before that?

1823
02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:51,168
Yes, on 2nd of this month.

1824
02:00:52,168 --> 02:00:53,585
Where were they going?

1825
02:00:54,043 --> 02:00:56,626
It seems to attend some
retreat in Thoddupuzha.

1826
02:00:57,293 --> 02:00:58,043
Yuck!

1827
02:00:59,876 --> 02:01:03,126
Are you sure that they stayed
in your lodge for a day?

1828
02:01:03,501 --> 02:01:04,335
Yes sir.

1829
02:01:04,876 --> 02:01:06,168
Is he a regular customer?

1830
02:01:06,793 --> 02:01:07,335
No sir.

1831
02:01:07,668 --> 02:01:09,543
Then how come you remember them so well?

1832
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:11,251
I require a double room.

1833
02:01:11,251 --> 02:01:12,960
It's 650 + tax.

1834
02:01:13,210 --> 02:01:15,835
I've stayed here before also.
I was provided a room without tax.

1835
02:01:15,835 --> 02:01:17,960
- May be it was without bill?
- I don't need a bill.

1836
02:01:22,501 --> 02:01:24,793
Is this hotel safe to
stay here with a family?

1837
02:01:26,001 --> 02:01:27,960
Why don't we look for some other hotel?

1838
02:01:28,460 --> 02:01:30,251
Madam, families do stay here often..

1839
02:01:30,626 --> 02:01:33,835
Only after showing them the room,
they agreed.

1840
02:01:35,335 --> 02:01:37,126
Do you remember when they stayed
in your hotel?

1841
02:01:37,626 --> 02:01:38,835
I don't remember.

1842
02:01:39,793 --> 02:01:41,876
Did they tell you why they've been
to Thoddupuzha?

1843
02:01:42,251 --> 02:01:43,793
I don't remember.

1844
02:01:44,043 --> 02:01:45,335
Have you checked his register?

1845
02:01:45,335 --> 02:01:47,876
Yes Madam. They maintain two registers.

1846
02:01:48,251 --> 02:01:49,543
Georgekutty's name is in
one of their registers.

1847
02:01:53,293 --> 02:01:57,710
They checked in at August 2nd
and checked out next day at 9.30 a.m.

1848
02:01:58,501 --> 02:01:59,710
Why are you maintaining two registers?

1849
02:02:00,210 --> 02:02:01,543
Why you are dumb struck?
Answer her.

1850
02:02:01,918 --> 02:02:05,668
We maintain two registers for
billed and unbilled customers.

1851
02:02:06,168 --> 02:02:08,418
Don't you know it's against law?

1852
02:02:12,501 --> 02:02:16,460
How could you remember them
so well even after so many days?

1853
02:02:16,876 --> 02:02:19,710
Can we easily forget our good customers?

1854
02:02:20,043 --> 02:02:23,001
- Are you the owner of this hotel?
- Yes. Why?

1855
02:02:23,710 --> 02:02:26,626
We've not tasted such delicious biriyani
in recent times.

1856
02:02:27,376 --> 02:02:29,668
Our food is the best in this town.

1857
02:02:29,668 --> 02:02:31,168
Not only your food,

1858
02:02:31,168 --> 02:02:33,918
I've not come across any another hotel
with good cleanliness and best service.

1859
02:02:34,668 --> 02:02:35,543
Sir, bill.

1860
02:02:37,376 --> 02:02:38,293
What are you doing sir?

1861
02:02:38,585 --> 02:02:41,543
I'm running a small business
and also take care of farming.

1862
02:02:41,543 --> 02:02:43,001
Biriyani was Super uncle.

1863
02:02:43,001 --> 02:02:44,876
Is it? Thank you.

1864
02:02:46,626 --> 02:02:48,043
- What's your name child?
- Anu

1865
02:02:48,751 --> 02:02:50,585
- Which class are you studying?
- 6 th class.

1866
02:02:50,585 --> 02:02:52,001
Have you come to
Thoddupuzha for shopping?

1867
02:02:52,001 --> 02:02:55,376
We came to attend Divine retreat
held in Parapalli yesterday

1868
02:02:58,418 --> 02:03:00,251
I can understand when you say that
you remember a customer.

1869
02:03:00,501 --> 02:03:04,210
But when you also remember the purpose
and date of his visit,

1870
02:03:04,543 --> 02:03:06,251
Then there's something fishy in that.

1871
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:08,501
I remembered because he told me.

1872
02:03:08,710 --> 02:03:10,085
A businessman will remember
a good customer...

1873
02:03:10,085 --> 02:03:12,043
- You wait out.
- What is this man?

1874
02:03:12,418 --> 02:03:15,001
If he and his family were at home
on 2nd and 3rd of this month,

1875
02:03:15,376 --> 02:03:17,043
Then how could he
meet them at Thoddupuzha?

1876
02:03:17,043 --> 02:03:18,793
That confuses me too madam.

1877
02:03:19,001 --> 02:03:21,918
Geetha, may be their
statements are true.

1878
02:03:22,251 --> 02:03:23,835
I doubt whether this man is lying.

1879
02:03:25,043 --> 02:03:26,918
No sir, I didn't lie.

1880
02:03:27,293 --> 02:03:29,043
I'm damn sure it was Georgekutty
whom I saw that day.

1881
02:03:30,793 --> 02:03:33,085
I'm ready to quit my job
if it's proved otherwise.

1882
02:03:36,168 --> 02:03:38,043
Have you contacted the Father
who conducted the Divine retreat?

1883
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:40,376
Father was in Mumbai.
Must've reached today.

1884
02:03:42,293 --> 02:03:43,085
Call him.

1885
02:03:43,085 --> 02:03:44,418
Madam, by the way you say,

1886
02:03:44,793 --> 02:03:46,126
I feel he has attended the retreat.

1887
02:03:46,418 --> 02:03:48,251
Otherwise it's difficult for the one
to tell it so correctly.

1888
02:03:48,501 --> 02:03:52,126
Because, the stories and other things
which I shared in that Retreat,

1889
02:03:52,418 --> 02:03:54,001
was not shared to any one by me.

1890
02:03:55,001 --> 02:03:58,626
Suppose it could also have been
shared by someone who attended Retreat

1891
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:02,835
I don't think anybody can tell to him
in such a detailed way

1892
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:13,210
Two nos.

1893
02:04:16,543 --> 02:04:17,626
Where's father and Anu?

1894
02:04:19,418 --> 02:04:21,085
This is digital Projector.

1895
02:04:21,501 --> 02:04:23,876
I'm planning to set up a
theater in my place.

1896
02:04:23,876 --> 02:04:24,835
Very good idea!

1897
02:04:25,126 --> 02:04:27,626
Because we're moving to the
times of digital cinema.

1898
02:04:27,835 --> 02:04:30,501
Not only that,
maintenance cost is also low.

1899
02:04:30,710 --> 02:04:31,543
Father.

1900
02:04:32,543 --> 02:04:34,126
My family.

1901
02:04:36,001 --> 02:04:37,585
Do you remember when they came?

1902
02:04:37,793 --> 02:04:39,585
I think it was 3rd of this month.

1903
02:04:42,001 --> 02:04:43,335
How could you remember
this date so correctly?

1904
02:04:44,293 --> 02:04:46,210
He watched the film sitting
in projector room.

1905
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:51,918
He also told me that he attended the
retreat and stayed in some lodge.

1906
02:04:52,126 --> 02:04:53,126
Get away you.

1907
02:05:04,043 --> 02:05:04,960
Come here.

1908
02:05:12,876 --> 02:05:13,751
Our son...

1909
02:05:14,876 --> 02:05:16,168
Nothing will happen to him.

1910
02:05:17,376 --> 02:05:19,251
We'll surely find him.

1911
02:05:19,835 --> 02:05:22,335
But you don't lose hope.

1912
02:05:29,710 --> 02:05:35,376
Is our investigation moving
at the right path?

1913
02:05:36,168 --> 02:05:38,626
Yeah, I think so.

1914
02:05:38,835 --> 02:05:43,960
But till this time,
we never got any favorable evidences.

1915
02:05:44,418 --> 02:05:46,668
All evidences are favorable to them.

1916
02:05:47,043 --> 02:05:50,293
See Prabha, I'm not telling this
based on the evidences

1917
02:05:51,793 --> 02:05:53,793
From a person's
conversation and behavior,

1918
02:05:54,793 --> 02:05:56,835
We police can easily

1919
02:05:56,835 --> 02:06:00,251
identify whether the concerned person is
lying or concealing.

1920
02:06:00,835 --> 02:06:02,460
Because we trained for that.

1921
02:06:04,876 --> 02:06:07,043
Evidences may be favorable to him.

1922
02:06:08,126 --> 02:06:09,251
But he's lying.

1923
02:06:10,168 --> 02:06:11,085
I can feel it.

1924
02:06:13,335 --> 02:06:14,543
Perhaps,

1925
02:06:14,543 --> 02:06:17,335
it may be the mental state of a mother

1926
02:06:17,335 --> 02:06:20,668
who inquires about
her son's disappearance.

1927
02:06:23,835 --> 02:06:27,210
Otherwise I underestimated him.

1928
02:06:28,126 --> 02:06:32,001
He has much more intelligence
than that of a 4th grade villager

1929
02:06:35,126 --> 02:06:36,793
Georgekutty is really a
kind hearted person.

1930
02:06:37,043 --> 02:06:38,168
I verified his past.

1931
02:06:39,043 --> 02:06:41,168
He had come to this place
thirty five years ago.

1932
02:06:41,168 --> 02:06:44,126
Provision store, Video Library,
Automobiles, Real estate, etc

1933
02:06:44,126 --> 02:06:46,168
He grew up dealing with
many such businesses.

1934
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:48,001
He's fond of films.

1935
02:06:48,001 --> 02:06:49,501
There isn't any film
which he hadn't watched.

1936
02:06:50,085 --> 02:06:51,418
Though he studied up to 4th grade,

1937
02:06:51,668 --> 02:06:54,626
He can speak Malayalam, Tamil,
English, Hindi, languages

1938
02:06:54,626 --> 02:06:56,210
He learnt these from films.

1939
02:06:56,501 --> 02:06:58,876
Can an ordinary man do all this?

1940
02:07:02,001 --> 02:07:02,710
Cinema!

1941
02:07:04,668 --> 02:07:05,751
It's an important link.

1942
02:07:06,126 --> 02:07:07,251
Ticket.. Ticket.

1943
02:07:08,793 --> 02:07:11,001
When you come across
hundreds of people a day,

1944
02:07:11,543 --> 02:07:13,876
It's not strange for you
to remember one family.

1945
02:07:14,376 --> 02:07:18,126
But remembering their purpose
and date of journey,

1946
02:07:18,126 --> 02:07:19,626
It is really odd.

1947
02:07:20,085 --> 02:07:22,876
He traveled in your bus on last 3rd.

1948
02:07:23,126 --> 02:07:25,126
And also told you he was returning
from the retreat held on 2nd.

1949
02:07:25,376 --> 02:07:28,501
How could you still remember
which was told 25 days back,

1950
02:07:28,501 --> 02:07:29,626
That's what is Madam's question.

1951
02:07:30,126 --> 02:07:32,376
I don't remember whatever
he told me that clay.

1952
02:07:32,376 --> 02:07:35,793
Just now it was you who told us
about the retreat held on 2nd.

1953
02:07:35,793 --> 02:07:36,710
What I meant was,

1954
02:07:37,126 --> 02:07:39,210
he told me this when we met recently.

1955
02:07:41,501 --> 02:07:42,668
Recently means,

1956
02:07:43,501 --> 02:07:45,376
Since 3-4 days.

1957
02:07:45,626 --> 02:07:46,460
Where did you meet him?

1958
02:07:52,585 --> 02:07:53,376
Uncle!

1959
02:07:55,668 --> 02:07:56,668
Where are you people going?

1960
02:07:58,460 --> 02:07:59,585
Don't you recognize me?

1961
02:08:00,210 --> 02:08:01,585
Georgekutty, don't you recognize him?

1962
02:08:01,585 --> 02:08:03,835
Didn't we come for a
Retreat here on last 2nd,

1963
02:08:04,210 --> 02:08:06,668
Next day on 3rd he was the conductor
in the bus which we traveled.

1964
02:08:06,668 --> 02:08:07,460
Yes got it.

1965
02:08:07,668 --> 02:08:10,085
We attended retreat on 2nd and
returned by an evening bus on 3rd,

1966
02:08:10,085 --> 02:08:13,335
conductor of that bus.
Sorry, I couldn't suddenly recollect.

1967
02:08:14,126 --> 02:08:15,585
Come children.

1968
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:30,960
Has the show started?

1969
02:08:31,918 --> 02:08:32,960
Not yet.

1970
02:08:34,085 --> 02:08:35,626
Are you alone?
Haven't you brought your family?

1971
02:08:35,876 --> 02:08:37,001
No I came alone.

1972
02:08:37,543 --> 02:08:39,668
I had come for a retreat on 2nd.

1973
02:08:40,126 --> 02:08:41,043
That's why I had come with my family.

1974
02:08:41,751 --> 02:08:43,335
Too many expenses
when taking a family out.

1975
02:08:44,210 --> 02:08:46,543
Next day, on 3rd, after shopping,

1976
02:08:46,543 --> 02:08:49,293
Watched a film here, had food at
hotel and left home that evening.

1977
02:08:50,335 --> 02:08:52,585
You just imagine how
much could be the expenses.

1978
02:08:59,710 --> 02:09:00,710
Hey Murali,

1979
02:09:00,710 --> 02:09:03,876
You never took fare from us when
we traveled for a retreat on last 2nd.

1980
02:09:04,126 --> 02:09:05,460
But today you'll have to
take the fare from me.

1981
02:09:05,460 --> 02:09:07,585
- Oh no Georgekutty.
- You'll have to.

1982
02:09:07,585 --> 02:09:09,043
Madam you tell him.

1983
02:09:09,335 --> 02:09:10,793
What chetta!

1984
02:09:17,918 --> 02:09:19,710
- Greetings!
- Yes Greetings!

1985
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:20,543
It's long time since we met.

1986
02:09:20,835 --> 02:09:25,335
Long time? Didn't we come here next day
after attending the retreat on last 2nd?

1987
02:09:25,835 --> 02:09:28,085
To tell it accurately,
it was on 3rd of August.

1988
02:09:32,126 --> 02:09:33,835
He never met me after that madam.

1989
02:09:37,126 --> 02:09:38,251
Not that many days.

1990
02:09:39,251 --> 02:09:42,085
Didn't I tell you the next day
when we returned from the retreat?

1991
02:09:43,376 --> 02:09:44,751
When did we go for the retreat?

1992
02:09:45,751 --> 02:09:47,876
On Saturday, August 2nd.

1993
02:09:47,876 --> 02:09:50,543
When? 2nd of August, on Saturday.

1994
02:09:51,251 --> 02:09:53,168
We returned on 3rd that was on Sunday.

1995
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:57,835
The very next day, on 4th of August,
that was on Monday,

1996
02:09:58,251 --> 02:09:59,585
Didn't I ask you to pay the tax?

1997
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:07,251
The strength of his patience
changed King's mind.

1998
02:10:08,043 --> 02:10:10,543
So all of us should learn to forgive.

1999
02:10:10,793 --> 02:10:11,835
A very good story.

2000
02:10:12,793 --> 02:10:14,376
How did you know this Georgekutty?

2001
02:10:14,751 --> 02:10:17,626
Didn't I tell you about the
retreat we attended on 2nd,

2002
02:10:18,501 --> 02:10:21,085
It was on 2nd of this month,
on a Saturday,

2003
02:10:21,543 --> 02:10:23,001
It was one of the stories
Father shared in the retreat.

2004
02:10:32,668 --> 02:10:35,501
Hello, no, it's not Madam's number.

2005
02:10:36,543 --> 02:10:38,543
Yes called up from this number only.

2006
02:10:39,751 --> 02:10:40,918
Who's that?

2007
02:10:41,710 --> 02:10:43,335
Father Kacharapalli whom we spoke to.

2008
02:10:48,835 --> 02:10:49,668
Tell me father,

2009
02:10:51,835 --> 02:10:52,585
CD?

2010
02:10:52,793 --> 02:10:54,085
Those who paid and booked for CDs,

2011
02:10:54,335 --> 02:10:56,960
are asked to collect from
Church's office within week's time.

2012
02:10:57,210 --> 02:10:59,085
I spoke to the concerned authority.

2013
02:10:59,376 --> 02:11:01,335
But his name wasn't mentioned
in the booking list.

2014
02:11:01,585 --> 02:11:04,085
Perhaps he could have
booked in a fake name.

2015
02:11:04,335 --> 02:11:05,626
Everything could be right.

2016
02:11:05,835 --> 02:11:06,960
But none of these statements,

2017
02:11:07,210 --> 02:11:11,376
Mismatch the evidences to prove that
he was not on town on 2nd and 3rd,

2018
02:11:12,168 --> 02:11:13,793
It was almost 8.30 a.m.

2019
02:11:13,793 --> 02:11:15,293
Retreat was started
by the time we reached.

2020
02:11:15,293 --> 02:11:16,668
I think it was on 2nd of this month.

2021
02:11:16,918 --> 02:11:18,710
Georgekutty wasn't
here on 2nd of this month.

2022
02:11:18,710 --> 02:11:20,001
He sat in the projector room
and watched film.

2023
02:11:20,251 --> 02:11:22,043
He told me this when
he met us few days back.

2024
02:11:22,043 --> 02:11:24,335
You didn't take fare from me
when we traveled for retreat.

2025
02:11:24,335 --> 02:11:27,668
I came for a retreat
on 2nd with my family.

2026
02:11:38,876 --> 02:11:40,585
He just recreated that clay.

2027
02:11:41,918 --> 02:11:42,793
What?

2028
02:11:44,043 --> 02:11:44,918
Don't you get it?

2029
02:11:45,668 --> 02:11:47,293
He just recreated that clay.

2030
02:11:48,876 --> 02:11:52,835
He recreated the days
of 2nd and 3rd of August.

2031
02:11:54,376 --> 02:11:55,918
What is the importance of Cinema?

2032
02:11:56,710 --> 02:11:57,626
Visuals.

2033
02:11:58,543 --> 02:12:01,626
Nothing else can be recorded
so profoundly in our mind

2034
02:12:01,626 --> 02:12:02,835
other than a visual.

2035
02:12:04,335 --> 02:12:09,126
Journey on 2nd and 3rd wasn't just a
cooked up story by them.

2036
02:12:09,960 --> 02:12:11,085
They really executed it.

2037
02:12:12,793 --> 02:12:14,918
The fact is they really
executed that journey.

2038
02:12:15,626 --> 02:12:18,376
That's why their story didn't
fizzle out during our interrogation.

2039
02:12:18,835 --> 02:12:20,960
Had they gone for
a journey on 2nd and 3rd,

2040
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:22,793
their Journey on 2nd and 3rd,

2041
02:12:23,126 --> 02:12:25,501
was recreated on some other day.

2042
02:12:25,876 --> 02:12:28,668
May be on next days?

2043
02:12:28,668 --> 02:12:31,626
Next days means, Monday and Tuesday.

2044
02:12:33,043 --> 02:12:36,251
Madam, his children hadn't gone to
school since Monday to Wednesday.

2045
02:12:36,626 --> 02:12:37,751
We also inquired him about that.

2046
02:12:38,668 --> 02:12:40,960
Georgekutty said they got drenched
in the rain while returning

2047
02:12:41,168 --> 02:12:44,876
and his wife and children
were down with fever.

2048
02:12:45,168 --> 02:12:47,876
Then he also showed us the
medical shop bills.

2049
02:12:48,168 --> 02:12:49,668
Those bills are fake ones.

2050
02:12:50,376 --> 02:12:52,751
Is it hard to get a fake medical bill?

2051
02:12:54,251 --> 02:12:56,418
Even otherwise, he plays this game
with too many bills.

2052
02:12:56,668 --> 02:12:58,668
But lodge register on 2nd,

2053
02:12:58,918 --> 02:13:01,335
Bus ticket and Matinee Ticket dated 3rd,

2054
02:13:01,626 --> 02:13:02,293
How could they be fake ones?

2055
02:13:02,585 --> 02:13:03,501
Those are original ones aren't they?

2056
02:13:03,876 --> 02:13:05,251
That's also an important point, Madam.

2057
02:13:07,126 --> 02:13:11,960
Here's where we underestimated
the 4th grade Georgekutty.

2058
02:13:13,418 --> 02:13:14,835
I know how he did it.

2059
02:13:15,793 --> 02:13:19,626
On 3rd morning, Georgekutty left for
Thoddupuzha by Varun's car.

2060
02:13:20,043 --> 02:13:23,626
After taking a parcel from a
Vegetarian hotel there,

2061
02:13:24,001 --> 02:13:27,793
He bought a mobile phone,
then inserted Varun's sim in it,

2062
02:13:27,793 --> 02:13:30,210
And he threw it inside
some National Permit vehicle.

2063
02:13:30,793 --> 02:13:34,418
May be after that he abandoned
the car in Rock quarry Pond.

2064
02:13:34,835 --> 02:13:37,126
Then he again entered a restaurant
and without anybody's notice,

2065
02:13:37,126 --> 02:13:39,793
he took a bill for 4 biriyanis.

2066
02:13:40,793 --> 02:13:45,501
On that very same day, he purchased 4
tickets for Matinee show in Thoddupuzha.

2067
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:50,168
Later boarded a transport bus,
bought 4 tickets and returned home.

2068
02:13:50,585 --> 02:13:51,710
He went to his office that night,

2069
02:13:51,710 --> 02:13:54,960
and made Monichhan believe that he's
going for retreat the next day.

2070
02:13:55,418 --> 02:13:58,710
Next day on 4th, he traveled in
Murali's bus with his family,

2071
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:01,876
And made him aware that
they are going for a retreat.

2072
02:14:02,501 --> 02:14:04,918
After reaching Parapalli at 9 a.m,

2073
02:14:05,168 --> 02:14:07,043
they spent there till evening.

2074
02:14:07,543 --> 02:14:10,335
During that time only he must have
come to know about the retreat CD.

2075
02:14:10,710 --> 02:14:12,793
And booked for it on somebody's name.

2076
02:14:13,376 --> 02:14:15,501
That evening, Georgekutty and his
family reached the lodge.

2077
02:14:15,710 --> 02:14:18,751
After he somehow averted the manager
from there for some time,

2078
02:14:19,210 --> 02:14:22,418
He added his name on 2nd.

2079
02:14:22,751 --> 02:14:25,543
Then on 4th, he forged his handwriting,

2080
02:14:25,835 --> 02:14:27,626
And booked a room on some fake name.

2081
02:14:28,085 --> 02:14:30,293
After taking dinner
from a wayside eatery,

2082
02:14:30,710 --> 02:14:34,251
Next day, Georgekutty again makes
someone to buy the parcel

2083
02:14:34,251 --> 02:14:36,793
from the same vegetarian hotel
he bought on 3rd.

2084
02:14:37,626 --> 02:14:39,501
After being checked out from the lodge,

2085
02:14:39,918 --> 02:14:41,751
Had Biriyani from the restaurant and

2086
02:14:41,751 --> 02:14:43,543
became friendly
with the restaurant Owner.

2087
02:14:43,751 --> 02:14:47,751
Then they went to theater and got
acquainted with the Projector operator.

2088
02:14:48,001 --> 02:14:50,585
He boarded the same bus
hat evening for returning home,

2089
02:14:50,585 --> 02:14:53,626
And created an atmosphere to get
friendly with the conductor.

2090
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:55,043
After reaching home,

2091
02:14:55,668 --> 02:15:00,793
Some day or the other the entire family
watched the retreat CD of Father.

2092
02:15:01,793 --> 02:15:04,085
He discarded the bills of 5th,

2093
02:15:04,335 --> 02:15:07,918
And instead, showed us the bills
he collected on 3rd.

2094
02:15:09,001 --> 02:15:11,793
Four or five days later he again
presented himself before them,

2095
02:15:11,793 --> 02:15:14,251
And engrossed the dates in their minds.

2096
02:15:15,043 --> 02:15:17,918
The real fact is, all were giving false
statements without their knowledge.

2097
02:15:19,668 --> 02:15:22,126
He's mocking at the
entire police department.

2098
02:15:23,835 --> 02:15:26,543
But we've no evidences to prove this.

2099
02:15:27,126 --> 02:15:28,835
Our's is just a theory.

2100
02:15:29,335 --> 02:15:31,668
Geetha, if whatever you say is true,

2101
02:15:32,043 --> 02:15:32,876
Then where's Varun?

2102
02:15:33,293 --> 02:15:34,501
Why did he go to him?

2103
02:15:36,210 --> 02:15:39,626
We should make that man answer that.

2104
02:15:40,085 --> 02:15:41,043
Come out..

2105
02:15:41,043 --> 02:15:43,251
What are you people doing?
Where are you taking them?

2106
02:15:43,918 --> 02:15:45,001
What are you trying to do?

2107
02:15:45,001 --> 02:15:47,126
Move fast.

2108
02:15:47,418 --> 02:15:50,085
Ask them about the issue.
I couldn't understand anything.

2109
02:15:50,085 --> 02:15:52,418
O Lord! Isn't there
anybody to question them?

2110
02:15:52,876 --> 02:15:53,793
My child.

2111
02:15:54,335 --> 02:15:56,626
Father, ask them not
to take them, Hello...

2112
02:15:57,335 --> 02:15:58,293
Get off you.

2113
02:16:02,043 --> 02:16:03,626
Why did Policemen take them?

2114
02:16:04,043 --> 02:16:06,085
Even I'm not aware of it.

2115
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:07,835
I don't understand anything.

2116
02:16:07,835 --> 02:16:09,168
Do something immediately.

2117
02:16:11,835 --> 02:16:15,376
I need your favor Rajesh.

2118
02:16:16,876 --> 02:16:18,376
If Police takes us again,

2119
02:16:19,210 --> 02:16:21,835
You'll have to call certain people
whom I mention.

2120
02:16:23,626 --> 02:16:25,835
Hello, is it Asianet news?

2121
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:35,001
Where's my son?

2122
02:16:36,501 --> 02:16:39,460
I already told you that I'm not aware.
We weren't at home.

2123
02:16:39,460 --> 02:16:42,126
Do you think Police
department are fools?

2124
02:16:42,585 --> 02:16:45,835
We understood the journey you
executed for creating evidences.

2125
02:16:59,043 --> 02:17:00,460
Why did my son come to meet you?

2126
02:17:03,210 --> 02:17:05,043
What's the relationship
between you both?

2127
02:17:05,376 --> 02:17:07,710
I've not met Varun after the camp.

2128
02:17:09,001 --> 02:17:10,793
No point in telling lies any more.

2129
02:17:11,210 --> 02:17:14,001
It would be better
if you tell the truth.

2130
02:17:14,585 --> 02:17:16,918
Otherwise there'll be a change
in our way of interrogation.

2131
02:17:17,251 --> 02:17:19,460
I swear I don't know.

2132
02:17:25,626 --> 02:17:27,335
It'll be good for you to tell the truth.

2133
02:17:28,793 --> 02:17:30,376
Whatever we said is true.

2134
02:17:30,793 --> 02:17:33,210
We're not aware.
That day we weren't there,

2135
02:17:33,210 --> 02:17:34,626
Sahadeva... Yes madam.

2136
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:42,626
- Oh no!
- Hey tell the truth,

2137
02:17:42,835 --> 02:17:43,793
Hey move away and stand.

2138
02:17:46,543 --> 02:17:49,085
Won't you tell?

2139
02:17:51,043 --> 02:17:53,418
I'll make you spill the beans.

2140
02:17:55,918 --> 02:17:57,626
Sir, please tell him to stop.

2141
02:18:06,251 --> 02:18:09,418
Please ask him not to harm him.

2142
02:18:14,376 --> 02:18:15,543
Father.

2143
02:18:20,710 --> 02:18:22,001
Tell the truth man!

2144
02:18:28,876 --> 02:18:31,751
Sahadeva, stop.

2145
02:19:00,876 --> 02:19:01,960
Where's my son?

2146
02:19:05,835 --> 02:19:07,293
I don't know..

2147
02:19:10,710 --> 02:19:13,668
Come here, let me see whether
I can make you tell the truth.

2148
02:19:16,043 --> 02:19:20,543
Where's Varun?
Where have you people hidden him?

2149
02:19:21,293 --> 02:19:22,543
Tell the truth.

2150
02:19:26,376 --> 02:19:29,751
Tell what you did to madam's son.

2151
02:19:46,335 --> 02:19:49,335
They've brought Varun's friend Alex.
Ask them to stop it.

2152
02:19:49,793 --> 02:19:52,085
That's enough, stop it.

2153
02:19:52,335 --> 02:19:54,001
- Come.
- Come with me.

2154
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:08,710
- Tell the truth man!
- No, move away.

2155
02:20:09,251 --> 02:20:10,126
Sir he...

2156
02:20:10,460 --> 02:20:11,293
I say move.

2157
02:20:20,543 --> 02:20:24,543
Georgekutty, please say whatever
you know about that Varun.

2158
02:20:26,376 --> 02:20:27,960
Why are you getting beaten up this way?

2159
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:29,335
I really don't know anything.

2160
02:20:30,335 --> 02:20:33,501
What's the problem?
Why are you getting beaten up this way?

2161
02:20:39,543 --> 02:20:41,043
You know this girl?

2162
02:20:41,793 --> 02:20:43,168
I don't know aunty.

2163
02:20:44,835 --> 02:20:49,210
Alex, we knew that you and Varun
were together in the camp.

2164
02:20:49,918 --> 02:20:52,585
Varun is missing since last 26 days.

2165
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:56,001
This girl is somehow connected
with Varun's missing.

2166
02:20:56,668 --> 02:21:00,793
So better tell us whatever you know,
it'll be good for you.

2167
02:21:01,126 --> 02:21:02,918
Uncle, I really don't know anything.

2168
02:21:03,376 --> 02:21:07,293
I know you called him
lastly the day he was missing.

2169
02:21:08,293 --> 02:21:11,376
When I asked you few days back,
you denied it.

2170
02:21:11,918 --> 02:21:13,501
If you are going to maintain that lie,

2171
02:21:14,210 --> 02:21:15,710
Then our way of
interrogating will change.

2172
02:21:15,710 --> 02:21:17,876
To tell the truth,
when I called him that day,

2173
02:21:17,876 --> 02:21:20,293
He never told me his whereabouts
and the purpose he went.

2174
02:21:20,293 --> 02:21:24,626
Okay what's the relation between
this girl and varun?

2175
02:21:25,918 --> 02:21:26,918
You know it.

2176
02:21:28,210 --> 02:21:29,376
Hey better tell the truth.

2177
02:21:29,376 --> 02:21:30,210
I'll tell you.

2178
02:21:30,793 --> 02:21:31,918
He'll say.

2179
02:21:57,168 --> 02:21:58,918
Dude! Send this to my mobile.

2180
02:21:58,918 --> 02:22:01,293
Oh no sorry! I'll not send you this.

2181
02:22:01,751 --> 02:22:03,418
What's this? Please send.

2182
02:22:03,418 --> 02:22:05,668
Very sorry, I can't send this.

2183
02:22:05,668 --> 02:22:07,043
I've to fulfill a purpose with this.

2184
02:22:07,543 --> 02:22:08,543
Shucks!

2185
02:22:15,710 --> 02:22:17,710
Madam, people have crowded outside.

2186
02:22:18,168 --> 02:22:19,168
I don't know how they learnt about it.

2187
02:22:19,835 --> 02:22:21,460
Few media and channel people are there.

2188
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:23,585
It seems they want to see you.

2189
02:22:24,251 --> 02:22:25,293
I don't wish to see anybody.

2190
02:22:26,168 --> 02:22:27,793
Not even a kid should
enter this compound.

2191
02:22:28,626 --> 02:22:30,501
- Call more forces if you require.
- Yes madam.

2192
02:22:32,001 --> 02:22:33,043
Come with me.

2193
02:22:34,626 --> 02:22:40,293
Geetha, things are getting more worse.

2194
02:22:41,085 --> 02:22:44,960
Yes! It's time to end this.

2195
02:22:52,501 --> 02:22:53,501
All of you stay out.

2196
02:22:53,876 --> 02:22:55,126
Sahadevan, stand here.

2197
02:22:59,543 --> 02:23:01,168
I came to know about your video.

2198
02:23:03,001 --> 02:23:05,626
- Where's my son?
- Sir, I don't know. I swear.

2199
02:23:10,751 --> 02:23:12,751
Sahadevan, I want to know the truth.

2200
02:23:13,835 --> 02:23:14,793
You got me?

2201
02:23:20,501 --> 02:23:21,501
- Tell me
- I don't know.

2202
02:23:21,501 --> 02:23:22,335
Where's that boy?

2203
02:23:22,335 --> 02:23:24,335
- I said I don't know.
- Tell me.

2204
02:23:31,251 --> 02:23:33,460
Tell me.
Where is that boy?

2205
02:23:35,668 --> 02:23:38,043
Otherwise I'll kill all of you.

2206
02:23:39,043 --> 02:23:40,710
You won't tell, wont' you?

2207
02:23:41,043 --> 02:23:42,835
Tell me.

2208
02:23:45,918 --> 02:23:48,335
You know the truth, speak out.

2209
02:23:51,710 --> 02:23:53,418
Tell me what happened.

2210
02:24:03,460 --> 02:24:05,210
Are you hindering a Policeman?

2211
02:24:10,085 --> 02:24:10,835
Tell me.

2212
02:24:10,835 --> 02:24:11,918
We are not aware sir.

2213
02:24:21,543 --> 02:24:22,793
Get up and come here..

2214
02:24:23,418 --> 02:24:24,460
Tell me what happened.

2215
02:24:26,710 --> 02:24:27,960
You won't speak out ah?

2216
02:25:04,960 --> 02:25:07,460
If I hit them anymore,
they would die.

2217
02:25:08,626 --> 02:25:11,376
If you don't wish for that,
you tell the truth.

2218
02:25:13,626 --> 02:25:15,251
Otherwise I will beat them to death

2219
02:25:18,126 --> 02:25:19,501
You want me to do that?

2220
02:25:22,293 --> 02:25:24,085
You want it?

2221
02:25:33,168 --> 02:25:34,376
Sahadevan.

2222
02:25:42,543 --> 02:25:47,043
Please tell us if
any of you know anything.

2223
02:25:54,085 --> 02:25:54,960
Where's Anumol?

2224
02:25:56,418 --> 02:25:58,168
- Shucks! My child!
- No

2225
02:25:59,626 --> 02:26:03,210
Tell me, didn't the boy in the photo
come to your house?

2226
02:26:03,793 --> 02:26:06,793
I don't know. I want to see my parents.

2227
02:26:07,668 --> 02:26:09,126
Stop crying and tell the truth.

2228
02:26:09,543 --> 02:26:11,001
Then I shall take you to your parents.

2229
02:26:11,710 --> 02:26:16,001
Tell me, don't stir up my anger.

2230
02:26:17,210 --> 02:26:19,293
I'll kill you, mind you.

2231
02:26:21,918 --> 02:26:24,876
No father, let's reveal everything.

2232
02:26:25,668 --> 02:26:27,293
Otherwise they'll torture Anumol.

2233
02:26:28,585 --> 02:26:29,918
He's too cruel!

2234
02:26:30,251 --> 02:26:31,376
I'm terribly scared.

2235
02:26:32,293 --> 02:26:33,501
I shall admit the crime.

2236
02:26:34,001 --> 02:26:35,376
That would end up everything.

2237
02:26:35,376 --> 02:26:37,085
Did we struggle hard for this?

2238
02:26:37,543 --> 02:26:38,501
Did we bear all their tortures for this?

2239
02:26:40,710 --> 02:26:42,793
You people will not be jailed.
That's my promise

2240
02:26:43,626 --> 02:26:46,043
If I couldn't keep up that promise,
then you won't see me alive.

2241
02:26:47,251 --> 02:26:48,251
Our Anu, they would..

2242
02:26:48,710 --> 02:26:49,585
They won't harm her.

2243
02:26:50,501 --> 02:26:51,626
You don't have to worry about that.

2244
02:26:52,126 --> 02:26:53,043
She'll manage!

2245
02:26:54,126 --> 02:26:56,668
- Tell the truth.
- I don't know uncle.

2246
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:58,293
I want to see my mother.

2247
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:02,043
Geetha, let's stop this.

2248
02:27:02,918 --> 02:27:04,376
Let's wrap it here.

2249
02:27:05,418 --> 02:27:07,376
What we're doing is against rules.

2250
02:27:07,376 --> 02:27:08,543
What about our son then?

2251
02:27:08,543 --> 02:27:10,210
Don't we've to enquire about him?

2252
02:27:10,751 --> 02:27:12,126
Yes we have to enquire
in some other way.

2253
02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:14,835
At least spare that little girl.

2254
02:27:15,501 --> 02:27:17,126
He tortured them so brutally.

2255
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:19,251
Still were you able
to get any information?

2256
02:27:21,626 --> 02:27:25,418
If they are really innocent then
Geetha, we may have to regret.

2257
02:27:25,960 --> 02:27:27,418
May be he had mistaken.

2258
02:27:29,251 --> 02:27:30,543
Mother!

2259
02:27:33,918 --> 02:27:35,085
You won't tell the truth is it?

2260
02:27:35,835 --> 02:27:39,001
No, don't kill me, I'll tell you.

2261
02:27:50,835 --> 02:27:51,960
Father.

2262
02:27:54,085 --> 02:27:56,126
- Leave me, I want to go to my father.
- Where are you taking my kid?

2263
02:27:56,835 --> 02:27:58,460
To show the place where
you buried that boy.

2264
02:27:59,793 --> 02:28:01,210
Your game is over Georgekutty.

2265
02:28:01,626 --> 02:28:03,543
You can spend time
with your family in Jail.

2266
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:06,585
No one can save you even if they think.

2267
02:28:07,043 --> 02:28:08,668
Put everybody in the jeep.

2268
02:28:44,210 --> 02:28:46,501
Hey move away..

2269
02:28:48,501 --> 02:28:49,710
Please let us inside.

2270
02:28:49,710 --> 02:28:51,626
Georgekutty is my son.

2271
02:28:52,293 --> 02:28:54,710
Whoever it's, nobody is allowed to
contact the accused.

2272
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:55,960
Accused? What's their crime?

2273
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:58,001
You'll come to know it.

2274
02:28:58,001 --> 02:29:00,460
We know that policeman Sahadevan
is settling his scores.

2275
02:29:00,460 --> 02:29:03,251
- Actually what's the problem sir?
- Even we are not aware of the issue.

2276
02:29:03,751 --> 02:29:06,626
They are my daughter, and son-in-law.

2277
02:29:07,501 --> 02:29:10,668
Few days back police held them
and interrogated them.

2278
02:29:10,668 --> 02:29:13,501
- For what?
- It seems I.G's son was missing.

2279
02:29:13,876 --> 02:29:14,876
Who are you?

2280
02:29:14,876 --> 02:29:15,626
He's my son.

2281
02:29:15,835 --> 02:29:17,751
It's a falsely implicated case.

2282
02:29:17,960 --> 02:29:21,210
Everybody knows about Georgekutty
and his family well.

2283
02:29:21,460 --> 02:29:24,126
They were leading a decent happy life.

2284
02:29:24,126 --> 02:29:26,126
They are trapped in a false case.

2285
02:29:26,126 --> 02:29:29,126
One who is standing near S.I, is that
Sahadevan, the main cause behind this.

2286
02:30:28,501 --> 02:30:29,251
Dean

2287
02:30:31,751 --> 02:30:33,460
I told the truth out of fear.

2288
02:30:34,668 --> 02:30:36,001
Did he hit you?

2289
02:30:36,001 --> 02:30:37,710
Yes I was terribly scared.

2290
02:30:37,710 --> 02:30:39,376
Doesn't matter child.

2291
02:30:54,335 --> 02:30:55,418
Doesn't matter child.

2292
02:30:55,876 --> 02:30:57,126
Are you angry with this father?

2293
02:30:57,126 --> 02:30:59,501
No father, are you angry with me?

2294
02:30:59,501 --> 02:31:01,501
No dear, what you did was right.

2295
02:31:43,460 --> 02:31:44,876
Father... Rajesh did you see?

2296
02:31:45,168 --> 02:31:47,793
That Policeman Sahadevan hit
my daughter brutally.

2297
02:31:48,335 --> 02:31:52,251
That Sahadevan tortured our family
for an uncommitted crime.

2298
02:31:52,751 --> 02:31:54,126
Sahadeva, no.

2299
02:31:57,460 --> 02:31:58,751
He's Sahadevan.

2300
02:31:58,751 --> 02:32:01,043
- Don't dare touch them.
- Who are you to say that?

2301
02:32:02,168 --> 02:32:03,335
He hit my child.

2302
02:32:04,335 --> 02:32:06,043
I'll hit more, what will you do?

2303
02:32:07,501 --> 02:32:08,376
Kill that bastard.

2304
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:10,210
Come on Come on.

2305
02:32:20,293 --> 02:32:21,293
Child, did policemen torture you?

2306
02:32:21,293 --> 02:32:22,168
You tell them without fear.

2307
02:32:22,668 --> 02:32:24,335
Nobody will harm you anymore.
You tell them.

2308
02:32:24,335 --> 02:32:25,793
Dear, tell me..

2309
02:32:26,376 --> 02:32:31,001
Following the disappearance case of I G
Geetha Prabhakar's son Varun Prabhakar,

2310
02:32:31,001 --> 02:32:33,626
Georgekutty and his family have
proven their innocence.

2311
02:32:33,918 --> 02:32:36,168
Following this incident,
at Rajakadu Police station,

2312
02:32:36,168 --> 02:32:39,210
Police Constable Sahadevan has been
suspended for inquiry,

2313
02:32:39,418 --> 02:32:43,085
S.I and other policemen connected
with this case have been transferred,

2314
02:32:43,293 --> 02:32:46,668
DGP has ordered the IG -Geetha
Prabhakaran to go on leave.

2315
02:32:47,085 --> 02:32:48,293
Based on the pubic interest petition,

2316
02:32:48,293 --> 02:32:50,376
if police wishes to interrogate
Georgekutty and his family in future,

2317
02:32:50,668 --> 02:32:53,460
Special permission has to be obtained
from Court, District court ordered.

2318
02:33:02,751 --> 02:33:03,793
Georgekutty.

2319
02:33:08,918 --> 02:33:09,876
Georgekutty.

2320
02:33:13,293 --> 02:33:15,085
L.G Geetha Prabhakaran resigned.

2321
02:33:18,460 --> 02:33:22,043
Georgekutty, if we think over,
hasn't their life become miserable?

2322
02:33:23,126 --> 02:33:24,460
What wrong have they done?

2323
02:33:25,210 --> 02:33:26,876
Even though she's a top I.G,

2324
02:33:27,418 --> 02:33:29,751
Beyond that, she's also a mother.

2325
02:33:31,418 --> 02:33:34,293
Actually, aren't we the ones
who've cheated them?

2326
02:33:38,126 --> 02:33:41,543
You think so because of the
goodness of your heart.

2327
02:33:42,668 --> 02:33:43,835
Just think the other way.

2328
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:48,126
Had the same tragedy happened
to our daughter because of him,

2329
02:33:49,293 --> 02:33:51,585
Wouldn't that mother try to
protect her son?

2330
02:33:52,293 --> 02:33:53,251
She would surely try.

2331
02:33:53,960 --> 02:33:56,376
Nobody can define the
right or wrong in this.

2332
02:33:58,293 --> 02:33:59,793
It's the nature of human to be selfish.

2333
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:02,876
Our dear ones are precious to us.

2334
02:34:03,501 --> 02:34:04,460
If we think in other way,

2335
02:34:05,293 --> 02:34:06,626
We can't live.

2336
02:34:07,335 --> 02:34:12,668
So let's forget this at our convenience.

2337
02:34:20,043 --> 02:34:23,668
Georgekutty,
when did you clear that body?

2338
02:34:26,918 --> 02:34:29,710
On Sunday night, when I returned
after clearing the car.

2339
02:34:30,543 --> 02:34:31,543
Where did you move that to?

2340
02:34:53,751 --> 02:34:57,376
Let that secret not be known
to second person in this world.

2341
02:34:58,668 --> 02:35:00,793
It would be buried along with me.

2342
02:35:02,168 --> 02:35:03,626
Your safety lies in it.

2343
02:35:11,085 --> 02:35:14,626
Did you hope that Anumol
would stick to it without revealing?

2344
02:35:15,793 --> 02:35:18,376
To be honest, all my calculations
went wrong here.

2345
02:35:19,376 --> 02:35:23,501
I never even expected that three of you
would stick to it so firmly..

2346
02:35:25,876 --> 02:35:27,960
Anumol could have revealed it
a little earlier.

2347
02:35:28,751 --> 02:35:29,626
Poor child.

2348
02:35:35,876 --> 02:35:37,918
You suffered a lot because of me.

2349
02:35:38,835 --> 02:35:41,668
What's this?
You did this all to protect us...

2350
02:35:41,668 --> 02:35:42,710
Father.

2351
02:35:42,710 --> 02:35:43,585
What's it dear?

2352
02:35:43,793 --> 02:35:45,460
Father, Police has come.

2353
02:35:49,835 --> 02:35:50,543
Where are you going?

2354
02:35:50,543 --> 02:35:52,460
Are you going to torture them again?

2355
02:35:53,501 --> 02:35:55,751
- Why have you come here?
- We like to meet Georgekutty.

2356
02:35:55,751 --> 02:35:56,751
Did you have court order?

2357
02:35:57,585 --> 02:35:58,335
What's it sir?

2358
02:36:03,751 --> 02:36:06,001
- What's the problem?
- Oh nothing, you can leave

2359
02:36:06,001 --> 02:36:07,501
Nothing, You people can leave

2360
02:36:09,293 --> 02:36:10,710
Let me change the dress

2361
02:36:42,835 --> 02:36:46,126
Without any pride and prestige of power,

2362
02:36:48,126 --> 02:36:50,460
Today Geetha is just a mother
desperately yearning for her son

2363
02:36:53,960 --> 02:36:56,293
When we, living with no hope of
having any children,

2364
02:36:57,460 --> 02:36:59,293
were suddenly blessed with a son,

2365
02:36:59,793 --> 02:37:01,585
we pampered him so much...

2366
02:37:01,585 --> 02:37:03,418
and now we stand
before you feeling guilty.

2367
02:37:07,793 --> 02:37:09,251
When we pondered pen-mindedly,

2368
02:37:10,376 --> 02:37:11,751
We realized one thing.

2369
02:37:13,293 --> 02:37:14,960
Whatever has happened to my son,

2370
02:37:15,543 --> 02:37:16,876
We are the ones who
are responsible for,

2371
02:37:17,210 --> 02:37:20,168
Not bringing him up on the right path.

2372
02:37:22,126 --> 02:37:25,876
Ever since we realized that,
we were yearning to meet you.

2373
02:37:28,626 --> 02:37:33,626
Knowingly and unknowingly
we tortured your family a lot.

2374
02:37:36,001 --> 02:37:37,043
Pardon us.

2375
02:37:38,335 --> 02:37:39,543
I beg your pardon for everything.

2376
02:37:43,876 --> 02:37:47,751
Before leaving for America
to my brother's place,

2377
02:37:49,918 --> 02:37:52,835
We felt like knowing what
actually happened to Varun.

2378
02:37:53,751 --> 02:37:59,501
Because each and every phone calls...
And every calling bells seemed

2379
02:38:00,335 --> 02:38:02,626
like his voice in our ears.

2380
02:38:04,626 --> 02:38:05,585
With its hope...

2381
02:38:06,751 --> 02:38:09,626
and its disappointments... unbearable
to us, we are forced to ask you.

2382
02:38:11,835 --> 02:38:13,626
Do we still have to wait for him?

2383
02:38:30,001 --> 02:38:31,001
We can understand it.

2384
02:38:33,293 --> 02:38:36,460
You may not have trust in us.

2385
02:38:37,460 --> 02:38:42,001
I can understand you.
We apologize for troubling you.

2386
02:38:49,585 --> 02:38:52,043
Come, let's go.

2387
02:38:55,085 --> 02:38:56,376
You're great people.

2388
02:39:01,251 --> 02:39:03,001
I am not broad-hearted like you.

2389
02:39:04,793 --> 02:39:06,251
I'm just an ordinary man.

2390
02:39:07,085 --> 02:39:09,626
With a small world consisting of
my wife and children.

2391
02:39:09,835 --> 02:39:11,001
That's my family.

2392
02:39:12,043 --> 02:39:14,335
I've not even dreamt of a
world beyond that.

2393
02:39:16,335 --> 02:39:18,918
In to that privacy,
came an uninvited guest.

2394
02:39:19,168 --> 02:39:21,626
A guest who was able to
shatter our family.

2395
02:39:24,001 --> 02:39:25,918
He never gave ears to our pleads.

2396
02:39:27,210 --> 02:39:29,376
In a situation not knowing
what to do, out of panic,

2397
02:39:30,126 --> 02:39:31,543
a small mishap happened.

2398
02:39:33,460 --> 02:39:36,626
After making sure that
he would never come again

2399
02:39:37,293 --> 02:39:39,585
We sent away that guest.

2400
02:39:52,293 --> 02:39:55,251
Even though it was not deliberate,
we shattered your dreams.

2401
02:39:56,335 --> 02:39:58,876
We too wished to fall
at your feet to beg pardon.

2402
02:39:59,460 --> 02:40:01,501
And we did it hundred
times in our hearts.

2403
02:40:02,585 --> 02:40:04,085
What else can we do?

2404
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:09,210
Like everybody, for me too
my family is important.

2405
02:40:10,418 --> 02:40:12,251
I'll go to any extreme for it
not to get shattered.

2406
02:40:12,876 --> 02:40:16,001
There in front of me,
everything is right only.

2407
02:40:17,585 --> 02:40:19,043
Please pardon us.

2408
02:40:52,876 --> 02:40:54,918
Hey S.I is calling you.

2409
02:41:02,001 --> 02:41:03,835
Sir, I'll leave my bag in the
quarters and come back.

2410
02:41:09,835 --> 02:41:11,001
Sir, this is Georgekutty.

2411
02:41:11,543 --> 02:41:15,085
I know. I've seen
a lot in T.V and papers.

2412
02:41:17,543 --> 02:41:18,376
Sign here.

2413
02:41:21,043 --> 02:41:21,751
Here.

2414
02:41:24,043 --> 02:41:26,168
I know you have the pride of
fooling the police.

2415
02:41:26,668 --> 02:41:28,918
Only till that boy's body is recovered.

2416
02:41:29,626 --> 02:41:31,085
I would be here for 2 or 3 years.

2417
02:41:32,835 --> 02:41:34,626
Never mind. I'll find it out.

2418
02:41:35,085 --> 02:41:39,210
No sir, I've never considered
Policemen as fools.

2419
02:41:40,210 --> 02:41:42,876
Instead, I've considered them as
protectors of the People.

2420
02:41:43,460 --> 02:41:46,126
That's why I strongly believe that

2421
02:41:46,585 --> 02:41:48,710
you and this Police station
will also protect me.

2422
02:42:45,085 --> 02:42:46,626
Removal of planks from the roof
will be done today.

2423
02:42:47,043 --> 02:42:49,776
Should start the flooring work of
Police station from Monday.
