This stomach belongs
to the protagonist of our story.

24
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,370
Signs of cancer
are already present,

25
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,330
but he doesn't know that yet.

AND CITY HALL MEET

PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO SUBMIT
And it breeds mosquitoes.

YOUR COMPLAINTS
AND REQUESTS HERE

31
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,370
Can't you do something?

32
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,290
It would make a great playground
if you filled it in.

33
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,300
Just a moment, please.

34
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,260
Sir, they've come to complain
about open sewage.

35
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,600
Send them to Public Works.

36
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,980
Here’s our protagonist.

37
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,910
But what a bore it would be
to describe his life now.

38
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Why?

39
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Because
he's only killing time.

40
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,120
Ηe's never actually lived.

41
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,250
You can't call this living.

42
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,720
Miss Odagiri...

43
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,310
how dare you,
during business hours?

44
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,970
It's just so funny!

45
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,740
What is?

46
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,900
The "Liar's Club."
Someone sent it around.

47
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,770
Read it to us.

48
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,370
"So you've never taken
a vacation?"

49
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,740
"That's right."

50
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,450
"Because City Hall
can't run without you?"

51
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,000
"No, because everyone
would realize

52
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,500
City Hall doesn't
need me at all."

53
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,600
This isn't even worth watching.

54
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,520
He might as well be a corpse.

55
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,730
In fact, he's been dead
for some 20 years now.

56
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,700
Before that,
he had some life in him.

57
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,240
He even tried
to do a little real work.

58
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,500
PROPOSAL FOR INCREASING
DEPARTMENTAL EFFICIENCY

59
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,710
SUBMITTED 11/7/1930
BY ΚANJI WATANABE

60
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,630
But there's nothing left
of that Will or passion.

61
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,430
They've been completely
worn down

62
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,060
by the minutia
of the bureaucratic machine

63
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,100
and the meaningless
busyness it breeds.

64
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,280
Busy... so terribly busy.

65
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,030
But in reality,
he does nothing at all

66
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,450
besides protecting
his own position.

67
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,250
The best way to protect
your place in this world

68
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,590
is to do nothing at all.

69
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,470
But is this enough?

70
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,640
Is this really enough?

71
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,270
For him to start
thinking seriously about this,

72
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,610
his stomach
will have to get a lot worse,

73
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,900
and he'll have to rack up
a lot more wasted time.

74
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,240
But any proposal
for creating a park

75
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,620
must go
to the Parks Department.

76
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,660
This seems to be more
a matter of sanitation.

77
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,380
Talk to your
district health center.

78
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,840
See the Sanitation Department.

79
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,800
See Environmental Sanitation.

80
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,630
Preventive Sanitation.

81
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,630
Disease Control.

82
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,140
Lots of mosquitoes?

83
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,140
That's a job for Pest Control.

84
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,940
The problem is seeping waste,
which means...

85
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,490
it's a problem for
the Sewage Department at City Hall.

86
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,320
That was originally a culvert.

87
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,330
That is,
it had a road over it.

88
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,490
You'll need the okay
of the Roads Department.

89
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,080
City Planning doesn't have
a policy for such cases.

90
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,000
Go to Zoning.

91
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,920
The Fire Department objected
to filling that cesspool.

92
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,510
They need it because
water pressure is bad there.

93
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,510
Are you kidding?

94
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,930
What we need is water,

95
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,150
not sewage that breeds mosquitoes
and causes rashes.

96
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Imagine cleaning that sewage
out of our hoses!

97
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,820
If there were a kiddie pool there,
that'd be great for us too.

98
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,200
What about
your local school district?

99
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,870
They should have
a Child Welfare section.

100
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,000
But this problem
doesn't only affect children.

101
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,590
Rebuilding all the schools
has exhausted our resources.

102
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,130
A problem this big
should be handled

103
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,390
by your city councilman.

104
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,770
Sure, I'll write an introduction
to the deputy mayor.

105
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,600
Take my business card.
He'll see you right away.

106
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,940
Please have a seat.

107
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,070
Thank you
for all your efforts.

108
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,950
There's really nothing
we welcome more

109
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,160
than folks like you
who bring grievances like this

110
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,410
directly to our attention.

111
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,750
It's precisely
for people like you

112
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,920
that we established
our new Public Affairs section.

113
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,840
Don't hesitate
to tell them all about it!

114
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,010
Show these nice folks
to the Public Affairs desk.

115
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,310
You'll need to talk
to Public Works. Desk 8.

116
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,530
How dare you!
Stop giving us the runaround!

117
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,950
Why did you even put up
that sign?

118
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,950
So we'd waste our time?

119
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,990
We're not idlers
like all of you!

120
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,540
We just want something done
about that stinking cesspool!

121
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,460
We don't care
if it's Public Works, Sanitation,

122
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,000
Public Health, or whoever!

123
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,260
That's for Public Affairs
to sort out!

124
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,010
Fine!
We're done with you jerks!

125
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,220
All you do is laugh at us!

126
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,140
You call this democracy?

127
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,810
Let's go.

128
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,320
Please wait a moment.

129
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,660
I'm afraid our section chief
is out today.

130
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,460
It would be best
if you could put it in writing.

131
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,680
PUBLIC AFFAIRS
SECTION CHIEF

132
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,350
What do you think?

133
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,440
The section chief
never takes time off.

134
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,820
Yeah. And he's been
listless recently.

135
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,860
But what'll we do
if he's out for a long time?

136
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,740
Exactly.

137
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,620
He wouldn't take a day off
just for a cold.

138
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,500
And nothing moves here
without his seal.

139
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,830
That's right.

140
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,380
I must say,
it's a terrible shame.

141
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,880
One more month

142
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,130
and he'd have set a record

143
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,840
of 30 years
without a single absence.

144
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,350
Some people are glad
he isn't here.

145
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,850
Bureaucrats always wonder
who'll take the boss's place

146
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,060
if he steps out.

147
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,820
He's been taking a lot of medicine.
What for?

148
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,490
His stomach.

149
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,570
He used to slurp
his noodles to the bottom,

150
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,740
but lately
he barely touches them.

151
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,000
Plain udon noodles in soup.
Yet another record.

152
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,960
I've never seen him eat
anything else.

153
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,500
Assuming the worst,
who'll replace him?

154
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,760
What's your rush?

155
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,300
A lot of guys have to die
before it's your turn!

156
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
X-RAY ROOM

157
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,870
- Mr. Hiraoka!
- Yes.

158
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,580
Your stomach?

159
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,790
My stomach's bad too.

160
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
They say it's chronic.

161
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,010
These days I hardly feel alive
unless my stomach hurts.

162
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,970
Mr. Κo Suzuki.

163
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,100
That man who just went in...

164
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,360
His doctor told him
he has an ulcer,

165
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,740
but I'm sure
it's stomach cancer.

166
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,240
Has to be.

167
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,210
And stomach cancer
is practically a death sentence.

168
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,340
The doc usually says
it's just a mild ulcer

169
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,720
and that there's
no need to operate.

170
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,550
That you can eat
whatever you want

171
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,970
as long as
it's easy to digest.

172
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,350
If that's what he tells you,
you've got a year at most.

173
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,020
But with some symptoms,
you won't even last a year:

174
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,860
first...

175
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,570
a dull, heavy pain.

176
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,620
Frequent unpleasant burping.

177
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,580
A dry tongue.

178
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,960
You can't seem to get
enough water and tea.

179
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,340
And then
there's the diarrhea.

180
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,930
And if it isn't diarrhea,
it's constipation.

181
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,640
Your bowel movements
turn black.

182
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,180
And then...

183
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,150
the meat you used to love
seems totally inedible.

184
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,320
Whatever you eat
you throw up half an hour later.

185
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,120
And then you start
throwing up food

186
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,580
you ate a week before.

187
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,000
At that point, you've got
three months at most...

188
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,220
Mr. Kanji Watanabe.

189
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,980
Mr. Kanji Watanabe.

190
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,810
Yes.

191
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,520
Have a seat.

192
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,360
Now, then... it looks like
you have a mild ulcer.

193
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,180
Please...

194
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,040
tell me...

195
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,170
the honest truth.

196
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,880
- Tell me it's stomach cancer.
- No.

197
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,470
As I just said,
it's a mild ulcer.

198
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,790
What about surgery?

199
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,080
Can't you operate?

200
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,920
No need for surgery.
It can be treated medically.

201
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,170
What about my diet?

202
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Well, let's see.

203
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,930
Use common sense.

204
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,430
If it's easy to digest,
you can eat whatever you like.

205
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,110
Has he got a year?

206
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,780
No, no more than six months.

207
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,910
- Six months?
- Yeah.

208
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
What would you do

209
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,660
if you only had
six months left to live?

210
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,170
Miss Aihara,
what about you?

211
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,010
See the Veronal
in the cabinet?

212
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,830
Is there a blackout?

213
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,710
The street lights are on,
and the neighbors' lights.

214
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,550
Strange.
I wonder if Father is out.

215
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,680
- Where's the key?
- In your handbag.

216
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,430
Did Mrs. Hayashi
leave it unlocked?

217
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,270
She's so irresponsible.

218
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,060
That's the problem
with a part-time maid.

219
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,230
Having her live in
wouldn't cost much,

220
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,520
but a burglary sure would.

221
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,860
That's Dad's mentality.
Typical petty bureaucrat.

222
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,740
It's freezing.
Just as bad inside as out.

223
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,080
That's why I hate
Japanese houses.

224
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,660
It's such a drag
coming home to this.

225
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,290
I'd like a modern house.

226
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,040
Honey...

227
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,210
a house of our own would cost
around 500,000 yen, right?

228
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,880
Could we use your dad's
retirement bonus as collateral?

229
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,050
It must be worth
700,000 by now,

230
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,390
plus a monthly pension
of 13,000 yen...

231
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,060
and another 100,000
in savings.

232
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,020
But you think he'd agree?

233
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,810
If he doesn't,
we'll say we're moving out.

234
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,690
That'll clinch it.

235
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,110
Even Dad doesn't want to take
that much money to the grave.

236
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,790
Dad, what's the matter?

237
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,230
Nothing.

238
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,300
Nothing at all.

239
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,890
Something's not right.

240
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,850
Listen...

241
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,270
- this is awful.
- What is?

242
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,150
He heard everything.

243
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,530
He's awful.

244
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,530
It may be his house,
but this is our room.

245
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,290
I can't believe he snuck in here
while we were out.

246
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,040
If he needed to talk to us,
he should have said so.

247
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,130
He's too old
to be sulking around.

248
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,800
Stop making that face.

249
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,140
Enough about your dad.

250
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,680
He has his life.
We have ours.

251
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,570
Hold me.

252
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,630
How sad.

253
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,880
She was so young.

254
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,430
And to leave
such a sweet little boy behind.

255
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,600
She must have died
filled with regret.

256
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,400
Would you stop?
You're like a broken record.

257
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,120
Hurry!
Mommy's getting away!

258
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,400
Whenever
remarriage comes up,

259
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,110
you always
use the boy as an excuse.

260
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,820
When Mitsuo grows up,

261
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,950
he won't care about you
as much as you think.

262
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,530
And when he gets married,
they'll push you aside.

263
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,830
You have to think
about your own future.

264
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,500
I'm telling you:
Find a good wife now.

265
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,630
Even my old lady says so.

266
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,960
She imagines
how filthy it must be

267
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,930
with an oily-skinned man like you
living as a widower.

268
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,470
Dad.

269
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,880
Mitsuo.

270
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,490
Good night.
Please lock the front door.

271
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,330
Mitsuo!

272
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,520
How about that?
Great hit, huh?

273
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,230
That batter is my...

274
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,830
Mitsuo...

275
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,710
Stupid idiot!

276
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,790
What was he thinking?

277
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,700
Mitsuo.

278
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,860
Mitsuo, be brave.

279
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,980
It's just your appendix.

280
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,650
It's no worse
than pulling a tooth.

281
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,460
Can't you stay
for the operation, Dad?

282
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:58,050
I've got...
some other things to do.

283
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,860
Banzai! Banzai!

284
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,370
Banzai! Banzai!

285
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,300
Dad!

286
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,880
Mitsuo...

287
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,340
CERTIFICATE
OF COMMENDATION

288
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,550
FOR 25 YEARS
OF DISTINGUISHED CIVIL SERVICE

289
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,220
Mr. Watanabe left for work
at his usual time.

290
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,390
What?

291
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,230
But nobody has seen him.

292
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,650
It's been five days now.
And he hasn't called in sick.

293
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,610
The subsection chief asked me
to check in on him.

294
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,150
Ma'am.

295
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,880
What? Impossible!

296
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,640
But it's true.
The man from his office said so.

297
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,930
What could he be up to?

298
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,020
It seems unbelievable,
but it's true.

299
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,690
The people at his house
looked baffled.

300
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,770
That puts me in a fix.

301
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,860
Why? I can stamp
any paperwork while he's out.

302
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,320
But he has to approve
any resignations, right?

303
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,410
Why?
Are you looking to quit?

304
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,080
I don't belong here.

305
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,970
Uncle, he even withdrew
50,000 yen.

306
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,180
That miser?

307
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,850
I wonder
if he's got a woman.

308
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,140
That would
really be something.

309
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,600
- Now, dear.
- I'm sure it's not that.

310
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,610
There's no telling
when it comes to love.

311
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,230
The ones you least expect
are the most susceptible.

312
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,030
If you ask me,

313
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,280
he's actually a real lecher.

314
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,740
A lecher
with a solemn veneer.

315
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,290
But he's stayed widowed
these 20 years for you.

316
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,540
It makes sense that
he'd eventually snap, right?

317
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,670
Nonsense. He's lost
a lot of weight recently,

318
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,630
and his oily skin
has gotten rough and dry.

319
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,800
There must be
another explanation.

320
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,510
You saw him recently?

321
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,390
Four days ago.
He showed up in the morning.

322
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,560
I thought there was definitely
something wrong.

323
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,360
But your uncle here
blurted out,

324
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,690
"Why so glum? If you've come
for a loan, forget it."

325
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,400
How could I suspect
a love affair

326
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,570
when he looked like that?

327
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,530
Hush! You see...

328
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,410
my husband thinks all men
are as debauched as he is.

329
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:09,010
Mitsuo, did anything
happen at home?

330
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,300
Nothing in particular.

331
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:37,870
Hey.

332
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,000
Deliver this to my place.

333
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,670
A guy from the magazine
is waiting there.

334
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,680
And get some cyclobarbital
at the pharmacy.

335
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,890
Just give them my name.

336
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,760
But sir, the pharmacy's
already closed.

337
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,600
Is it that late?

338
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,690
In this neighborhood
folks go to bed after dinner.

339
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,900
That stinks.

340
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,690
I can't sleep unless
I chase it down with whisky.

341
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,450
Pardon me for butting in...

342
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,160
but I happen to have some.

343
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,760
Much obliged.

344
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,020
May I pay you
the official price?

345
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,590
No, no.

346
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,810
I was planning
to throw it away.

347
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,820
- But...
- No, really.

348
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,850
Really?

349
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,530
Then let me
pick up your tab.

350
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,060
Oh, no.

351
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,660
You can hold
your liquor, right?

352
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,080
Drink up.
You hardly seem tipsy.

353
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,130
Thank you.

354
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,890
Even if I drink,
I'll just throw it up.

355
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,260
You see...

356
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,390
I have stomach cancer.

357
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,980
- Stomach cancer?
- Yes.

358
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,690
I don't know what to say.

359
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,150
In that case,
what you're doing is crazy.

360
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,370
Yes, I'm ashamed to admit.

361
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,740
I mean...

362
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,670
drinking when you have
stomach cancer is suicide.

363
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,300
The thing is...
I can't go through with it.

364
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,140
"Go ahead and kill yourself,"
I think.

365
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,020
And yet...

366
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,730
I just can't do it.

367
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,400
I mean...

368
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,940
I can't bring myself
to make it final.

369
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,160
But what have I been...
living for all these years?

370
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,250
You don't have children?

371
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,920
Does your stomach hurt?

372
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,720
No, it's not my stomach.

373
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,770
There seems to be
a deeper issue here.

374
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,980
No.

375
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,410
It's just...

376
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:05,120
that I've been such a fool.

377
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,580
I'm just...

378
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,840
so mad at myself.

379
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,850
Until just a few days ago...

380
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,560
I had never even
bought myself a drink.

381
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,820
It's only now
that I don't know

382
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,240
how much longer
I have to live...

383
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,820
that I've finally begun...

384
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,700
I understand.

385
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,080
I understand.

386
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,790
But drinking now
is plain crazy.

387
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,250
Besides,
does it even taste good?

388
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,090
No, it doesn't.

389
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,130
But for a little while

390
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,890
I can forget my cancer

391
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,350
and all the other
painful things.

392
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,210
This...

393
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,690
this expensive sake...

394
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,070
is like drinking poison...

395
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,290
to get back at myself.

396
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,700
I mean...

397
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,880
that is... it's kind of...

398
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,880
a painful feeling...

399
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,350
I understand.

400
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,060
Sorry to be
telling you all this.

401
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,680
Listen...

402
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,930
I have 50,000 yen on me

403
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,270
that I'd like to spend
all at once.

404
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,770
But I'm ashamed to admit

405
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,530
that I'm not even sure
how to go about it.

406
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,030
What I'm trying to say is...

407
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,620
You want me to show you
how to spend it?

408
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
Yes.

409
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,500
I realize
it's terribly forward of me.

410
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,910
But...

411
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,420
This money...

412
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,770
It took me decades
to save up this money.

413
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:24,440
All the more reason now to...

414
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,280
I understand.

415
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,870
But please put
your money away.

416
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,830
Tonight's on me.

417
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,830
But that's not...

418
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,080
Just leave things to me.

419
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,060
It's fascinating.

420
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,810
I realize it's rude
to call you fascinating,

421
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,690
but you're
an extremely rare individual.

422
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,900
I'm just a slacker

423
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,360
who writes second-rate fiction.

424
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,450
You've really
started me thinking.

425
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,380
They say there's
something noble about suffering,

426
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,220
and it's true.

427
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:32,300
Misfortune
teaches us the truth.

428
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:36,270
Your cancer has opened
your eyes to your own life.

429
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,940
People are fickle
and shallow.

430
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,820
We only realize
how beautiful life is

431
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,120
when we face death.

432
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:56,620
And even then,
few of us realize it.

433
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:00,170
The worst among us know
nothing of life until they die.

434
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,500
You're amazing! Rebelling
against your past self at this age!

435
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,090
That rebellious spirit moves me.

436
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,930
You were a slave
to your own life.

437
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,430
Now you'll become
its master.

438
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,020
It's our human duty
to enjoy life.

439
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,390
Wasting it is desecrating
God's great gift.

440
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,610
We have to be greedy for life.

441
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,070
They say greed is a vice,
but that's outdated.

442
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,280
Greed is a virtue,
especially greed for enjoying life.

443
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,880
Come on.

444
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,210
Let's go reclaim
the life you've wasted.

445
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,750
Tonight it will be
my pleasure

446
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,210
to act
as your Mephistopheles,

447
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,710
but a beneficent one
who won't ask for your soul.

448
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,140
How perfect!
There's even a black dog.

449
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,100
Lead the way!

450
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,640
Listen.

451
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,360
These silver balls are you.

452
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,860
They're your life itself.

453
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,950
People strangle themselves
in their daily lives.

454
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,200
This machine sets them free.

455
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:16,200
It's a vending machine
for dreams and aspirations.

456
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,230
No, don't!

457
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,110
You wouldn't know it,

458
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,860
but these women are
the greediest of all mammals.

459
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,910
It'll cost you a dozen hats
to get that old one back.

460
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:48,840
Besides,
you're a new man now.

461
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Time to buy a new hat!

462
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,820
Welcome.

463
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,370
Welcome.
It's been a long time!

464
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,250
The same for your friend?

465
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,980
What are you laughing at?

466
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,270
It's the honest truth.
He really does have cancer.

467
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,190
- Then why's he drinking?
- Idiot!

468
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,030
That's why
you'll never understand.

469
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,700
Εcce homo.
"Behold the man."

470
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,030
This man bears
a cross called cancer.

471
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,830
He's Christ.

472
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,830
If you were diagnosed with cancer,
you'd start dying right away.

473
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,670
But not this fellow.

474
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,750
That's when he started living.

475
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,840
Isn't that right?

476
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,060
Hey, don't stare like that.

477
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,230
It's rude.

478
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,160
This way.

479
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:40,110
Anyone want
to request a favorite?

480
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,160
"Life is Brief."

481
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,280
What?

482
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:47,830
"Life is Brief."

483
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:52,190
Fall in love, maidens

484
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,880
That love song
from the nineteen teens? Okay!

485
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:27,170
Life is brief

486
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:37,450
Fall in love, maidens

487
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:47,180
Before the crimson bloom

488
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:55,390
Fades from your lips

489
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:06,590
Before the tides of passion

490
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,700
Cool within you

491
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:21,790
For those of you

492
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:30,970
Who know no tomorrow

493
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,870
Life is brief

494
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,480
Fall in love, maidens

495
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:58,090
Before the raven tresses

496
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,940
Begin to fade

497
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:16,960
Before the flames in your hearts

498
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,480
Flicker and die

499
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,720
For those to whom

500
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:41,100
Today will never return

501
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,100
That's it!
That's the spirit!

502
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:57,070
Life is brief

503
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,690
Striptease.

504
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,740
It isn't... an art.

505
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,070
It's more than art.

506
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,330
It's more direct.

507
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,910
That female body

508
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,750
gently undulating
up there is a juicy steak,

509
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:05,750
a glass of liquor,
an injection of camphor,

510
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,470
testosterone,
streptomycin, uranium...

511
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,910
Stop, please.

512
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,250
Hey, stop the car.

513
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,770
Wha... do we have a flat?

514
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,770
I think he's throwing up.

515
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,300
Let's sing something.
I hate feeling blue.

516
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,580
Section Chief!

517
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,210
I thought it was you!

518
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,100
I hardly recognized you
in that new hat.

519
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,990
I'm glad I ran into you.
I was looking for your place.

520
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:02,030
Are you off to work?

521
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,030
No, I'm...

522
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,240
Do you have your seal?

523
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,700
No, it's back at home.

524
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,410
I want to quit City Hall.

525
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:16,130
I'm in a rush.
I've found a new job.

526
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,550
Then... come to my house.

527
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,520
- Why are you quitting?
- I'm bored.

528
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:39,150
It's killing me.
Every day is like the one before.

529
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,690
Nothing new ever happens.

530
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:45,990
I've put up with it
for a year and half,

531
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,490
but the only novel thing
that's happened

532
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,250
was that you took
five days off...

533
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:54,250
and now
this new hat of yours.

534
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,960
That's it.

535
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,130
Listen, don't say anything
when Dad gets back.

536
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,800
I have nothing to say.

537
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:09,350
I'm saying don't take
that carping attitude.

538
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,480
If you hadn't brought up
his retirement bonus...

539
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:16,690
How self-serving,
blaming it all on me!

540
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,190
You're the one
who brought up his savings

541
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,530
and how even he wouldn't
take it all to the grave.

542
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,240
But I still can't figure out

543
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:28,200
why that was enough
to make him act like this.

544
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,790
He's never once
stayed out all night.

545
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,660
Let's drop it.

546
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:35,290
We have no idea
what he's doing,

547
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:38,630
much less
whether it's our fault.

548
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,550
I'll wait here.

549
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,310
Please come in for a bit.

550
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,760
Honey!

551
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,250
Thirty years.

552
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:04,670
It kills me to think
of 30 years in that place.

553
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,930
I'm sorry.

554
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,970
No, it's just that...

555
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,420
recently...

556
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:17,230
every time
I see that award,

557
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,650
it reminds me
of that joke you read to us.

558
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,650
I mean,
it really rang true.

559
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,540
All these 30 years...

560
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,960
what have I been
doing there?

561
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:46,960
I can't remember
no matter how I try.

562
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:51,140
All I remember...

563
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,000
is just being busy...

564
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:01,020
and even then I was bored.

565
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,650
I had you all wrong, sir.

566
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,860
You really do understand!

567
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,690
What a surprise!

568
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,200
That's crazy.

569
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,040
Whatever Uncle says,
I know Dad best.

570
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:22,170
But...

571
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:27,000
It's unimaginable,
Dad with such a young girl.

572
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:39,390
It's not in the right format.

573
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:14,430
Are you going
to the office?

574
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,600
Yes, I have to submit this.

575
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:20,020
Could you turn in
my sick-leave form?

576
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,900
Why are you taking
so much time off?

577
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:28,820
Everyone's talking about it.
They're calling it your "mutation."

578
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:31,150
I just...

579
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,160
Are you really sick?

580
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,290
You do look kind of pale.

581
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:44,090
I just meant...

582
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:47,790
I didn't think so.

583
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,670
So where do you go

584
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,510
when you pretend
you're going to work?

585
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:57,470
Don't try to hide it.

586
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,480
But don't you know

587
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,190
that Mr. Sakai came here yesterday
and told them everything?

588
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,110
Who cares, right?

589
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,610
After 30 years
without an absence,

590
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:15,320
you deserve
at least six months off.

591
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:22,160
Besides, I'll cover for you.

592
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:25,210
- I'm not like Carp Windsock.
- Carp Windsock?

593
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:29,460
Yes, Mr. Sakai
is a human carp windsock.

594
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,180
His lips are always flapping,
but he's just hot air inside.

595
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,220
Plus he always acts
like such a big shot.

596
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:42,930
He makes 200 yen more
a month than I do,

597
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,850
so he looks down on me.

598
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,500
Bye, then.

599
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,760
Listen, I'll go with you.

600
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,640
Ma'am?

601
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:19,650
Ma'am!

602
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,290
You're so lucky.

603
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:26,290
I wish I could live
in a house like yours.

604
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,330
At our place,
three families share two rooms.

605
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,460
It's like
the Warring States period.

606
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:35,800
And you have
a wonderful son, right?

607
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,720
Tell me, where do they sell
women's stockings?

608
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,800
You want to buy some?

609
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:44,640
Western clothing stores
carry them.

610
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,730
For your daughter-in-law, right?

611
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:51,940
I've heard she's very pretty.

612
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,320
That's according
to Carp Windsock's report.

613
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,620
- Are you all right?
- I'm just so excited!

614
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,920
- They make you that...
- I'm so happy!

615
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,840
To buy them myself,

616
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,630
I'd have to have sardines
for lunch for three months.

617
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:22,680
But why did you buy them
for me?

618
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:26,060
Well, yours
had holes in them.

619
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:32,350
Do the holes in my stockings
make your feet cold?

620
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,770
Don't get me wrong...

621
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,320
I was just kidding.

622
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,650
I know you did it
out of kindness,

623
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:43,620
but I feel awkward
at times like this.

624
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:46,700
That's why I made a bad joke.
Forgive me.

625
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,230
Want to hear something good?

626
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,640
Something good?

627
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:14,770
I got so bored that I gave
everyone at work nicknames.

628
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,520
Wanna hear them?

629
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,740
- Sea Slug.
- Sea Slug?

630
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:20,570
Can you guess?

631
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,910
Someone who's slippery
and evasive.

632
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:27,030
Mr. Ono,
the subsection chief.

633
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,910
Sea Slug...

634
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:35,630
Gutter Cover. Someone who's
damp and gloomy all year round.

635
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,010
- Would that be Obara?
- Bingo!

636
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:44,050
Next: Flypaper.

637
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:47,510
- Flypaper?
- You know... sticks to everything.

638
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:50,810
You guessed, right?
Mr. Noguchi!

639
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:56,110
Next is the floor supervisor,
Mr. Saito.

640
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,940
Can you guess his nickname?

641
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:01,570
Mr. Saito.

642
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,950
Let's see...

643
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:08,410
His distinguishing feature
is that he has none.

644
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,290
I don't really know...

645
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,790
Set Menu.

646
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,630
- Set Menu?
- At the cafeteria.

647
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,680
And what about Κimura?

648
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:28,140
Jelly Noodles.
Timid and quivering.

649
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:34,140
I had a nickname
for you too.

650
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:39,610
But I'm not going to tell,
'cause I had you all wrong.

651
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:43,320
No, I don't mind.
Tell me.

652
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:46,160
Now I've put my foot in it.

653
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,450
No, it would be worse
if you didn't tell me.

654
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:52,620
Okay, then:
The Mummy.

655
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,790
Forgive me.

656
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:01,510
It's all right.

657
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:05,930
So you mean I'm...

658
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,280
I'll say good-bye here.
Thank you so much.

659
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,820
Do you really have to submit
your resignation today?

660
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:32,120
If you could
make it tomorrow,

661
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:34,370
we could spend today...

662
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,460
You're not eating anything.

663
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:08,510
It's just...

664
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,720
You look so tired.

665
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:16,180
No, today
was really a lot of fun.

666
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,810
But you snored through
the best part of the movie.

667
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,110
It's just that...

668
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:28,440
I overdid it a bit last night.

669
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,450
Mr. Κimura...

670
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:53,800
This is something...

671
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:57,140
I can't tell anyone.

672
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,850
It's too embarrassing.

673
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,810
You see, the reason...

674
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:06,730
I've worked...

675
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:11,860
like a mummy
these last 30 years...

676
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,490
Oh, no!

677
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:19,200
It's not that I mind you

678
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,710
calling me a mummy...

679
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:25,840
because that's exactly right.

680
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,840
I don't blame you at all.

681
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:36,890
It's just that the reason

682
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:40,640
I turned myself
into a mummy...

683
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:45,480
What I mean is
that I did it all...

684
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,940
for my son's sake.

685
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:53,950
But as it turns out,

686
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:56,210
my son...

687
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,120
couldn't care in the least.

688
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,790
But you can't blame it all
on your son.

689
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:09,210
Isn't that right?

690
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:13,050
Not unless he asked you
to become a mummy.

691
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,110
Parents are all the same.

692
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:32,360
My mom gives me
the same line sometimes.

693
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:35,110
"All the trouble
you've put me through!"

694
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,530
I'm grateful she had me,

695
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,990
but babies don't ask
to be born.

696
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,790
But what happened to make you
bad-mouth your son to me?

697
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:54,470
It's just...

698
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,010
I knew it!
You still adore him!

699
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:44,730
No end in sight
for the electricity shortage.

700
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:46,940
Is that right?

701
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,900
This heat is due to the warmest
ocean currents in 30 years.

702
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,610
Is that a fact?

703
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:01,930
Actually,
there's something...

704
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:05,470
I'd like to tell you.

705
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:12,440
I know I should have
told you sooner,

706
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:17,150
but it's not
very pleasant business.

707
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,780
Father, I already know.

708
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:24,120
You see, I discussed it
with Uncle today.

709
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:28,080
We must address practical matters
to avoid complications later.

710
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:31,460
For instance, although
we have rights as your heirs,

711
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:34,460
you need to make those clear
to avoid disputes.

712
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:37,800
She's taken you for 50,000 yen
in just a few days.

713
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,090
- Young girls these days...
- What are you...?

714
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,470
Father! We respect

715
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,350
your free will, all right?

716
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:46,810
We even accept
your debauchery!

717
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:49,640
But it's common sense
to set some conditions.

718
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:52,060
Think of Κazue,

719
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:54,320
or at least
of her family back home.

720
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,690
How dare you bring home
a woman like that!

721
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,700
And holding hands
with her in your room!

722
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:04,030
I could hardly face Mrs. Hayashi
when she told me!

723
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,320
Two weeks have passed

724
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:47,120
since our protagonist
abandoned his post.

725
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:58,550
During that time,

726
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,800
various rumors and speculations

727
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:04,800
about Mr. Watanabe
have made the rounds.

728
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:23,610
The rumors and speculation
all agree on one thing:

729
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,240
Whatever Mr. Watanabe
is doing,

730
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:28,700
it is very frivolous indeed.

731
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:32,580
But in point of fact,

732
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:35,540
Watanabe
had never been this earnest

733
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:38,040
about anything
in his entire life.

734
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,590
This isn't City Hall,

735
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,430
where you can waste
a whole day on an hour's work!

736
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,100
I just...

737
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,930
Every second I waste here
costs me money.

738
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:53,440
Then what about tonight?

739
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,940
I'm pooped at night.
I'd rather sleep than go out.

740
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:02,740
Besides, why are you
always taking me out?

741
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,150
It's just...

742
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:08,530
Let's stop doing this.
It doesn't feel right.

743
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:12,790
Just one last time tonight.

744
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,330
No, or it'll never end!

745
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,210
Now, excuse me.

746
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,450
Tonight's the last time, okay?

747
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,560
Shall we go for a stroll?

748
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,270
I've had enough.

749
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:59,350
Next it'll be a sweets shop,
then a sushi or noodle joint.

750
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:03,150
What's the point
of these endless rounds?

751
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:07,280
I feel bad saying this
when you pay for everything,

752
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,410
but I've had enough.

753
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:13,080
We've run out of things
to talk about.

754
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,160
There's that face again.

755
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:23,960
The truth is
you give me the creeps.

756
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:37,890
What's going on? Why do you
chase me around like this?

757
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:41,100
- It's just...
- It's just what?

758
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,110
It's just...

759
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:47,400
I enjoy spending time
with you this way.

760
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:49,570
A May-December romance?
Forget it.

761
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:51,140
No, no!

762
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:53,580
It's just that I...

763
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:57,870
Just spit it out
instead of sputtering like that.

764
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,920
- Are you mad?
- No.

765
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:17,470
I don't even know myself...

766
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:22,270
why I keep
following you around.

767
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:26,730
All I know is...

768
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:51,910
Listen:

769
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:54,510
I'm going to die soon.

770
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:58,430
I've got stomach cancer.
It's right here.

771
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,800
Do you see?

772
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:08,690
No matter how I struggle,

773
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:11,780
I've only got six months
to a year left.

774
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:15,200
When I found out,

775
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:17,910
I suddenly... in here...

776
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,040
Now I remember:

777
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:24,710
I nearly drowned in a pond once
when I was a child.

778
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,250
I felt exactly
the same way then.

779
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,670
Everything's going black.

780
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:32,220
I writhe and thrash around,

781
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,390
but there's nothing
to hold on to...

782
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:38,100
- except you.
- What about your son?

783
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:40,390
Don't talk to me about him!

784
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,560
I have no son.

785
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:47,650
- I'm all alone.
- But...

786
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:50,400
No, you don't understand.

787
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:55,110
My son
is somewhere far away.

788
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:58,910
Just as my mom and pop were

789
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:02,910
when I was drowning
in that pond.

790
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:05,420
Remembering it now,

791
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,920
it's even more painful
than it was then.

792
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:12,670
But why someone like me?

793
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,970
It's just that...

794
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:19,180
when I look at you,
I get a warm feeling...

795
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:21,550
right here.

796
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:26,150
Even an old mummy like me.

797
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:36,700
What I mean is,
you've been really kind to me.

798
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:39,660
No, that's not it.

799
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:43,370
You're young and healthy,
and that's why...

800
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:47,960
No.

801
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,670
I mean...

802
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:55,800
what makes you so lively?

803
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:57,970
You're just so full of life.

804
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:00,560
That's why I...

805
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,640
That's why this mummy
envies you!

806
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:08,520
Before I die,
even if only for one day,

807
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:11,730
I want to be like that.

808
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:15,820
Until I've done that,
I can't let myself die.

809
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:17,990
You see, I just...

810
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,990
I just want something to...

811
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,160
I want to do something.

812
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:27,000
I just don't know what.

813
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:29,170
But you know.

814
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:31,670
No, maybe you don't, but...

815
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,210
But I don't!

816
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:35,840
Tell me,
how can I be like you?

817
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:39,800
- But all I do is work and eat!
- What else?

818
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:41,760
That's all!

819
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:49,900
It's true.

820
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:52,770
All I do is make
these little things.

821
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,790
Just making these
is so much fun.

822
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:08,960
I feel like I'm making friends
with every baby in Japan.

823
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:13,960
Why don't you try
making something too?

824
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:18,130
What could I possibly make
at that office?

825
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:22,300
Yeah, it's hopeless there.

826
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:25,390
You should quit
and go somewhere...

827
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:35,900
It's too late.

828
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:12,940
No... it's not too late.

829
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,150
It's not hopeless.

830
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:19,820
Even there,
there's something I can do.

831
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:22,110
I just have to find the will.

832
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:34,090
There's something I can do.

833
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,130
It's only a matter of time
before he resigns.

834
01:30:14,290 --> 01:30:17,170
His son came by yesterday
about his retirement bonus.

835
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:20,510
Which means
you'll finally be section chief.

836
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:22,840
Well, you never know.

837
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:07,510
Good morning.

838
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:19,400
Section Chief.

839
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:26,450
Ono, take care of this.

840
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:30,620
PETITION TO REPAIR
AND FILL IN CULVERT

841
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:33,290
ΚUROE WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION

842
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:37,210
TO BE ASSIGNED
TO PUBLIC WORΚS

843
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:39,590
Is this really a job
for Public Works?

844
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:43,260
Actually, this is
precisely the kind of job

845
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:48,300
that Public Affairs
should oversee.

846
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:51,260
Public Works
can't do it alone.

847
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:54,850
Parks and Sewage
must also take action.

848
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,980
Get me a car, will you?

849
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,030
I'm going out
to survey the site.

850
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:06,610
Put together a report today.

851
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:09,240
Sir, I'm not sure
that's possible.

852
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:12,120
It is if you set your mind to it.

853
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:38,560
Five months later.

854
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:42,150
The protagonist
of our story has died.

855
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:30,700
Let us see the deputy mayor.
He must be here.

856
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:33,530
Just five minutes, please.

857
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:48,010
Reporters.
What should I tell them?

858
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:18,080
- Your suspicions are groundless.
- Are they?

859
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:21,080
Our claim is based
on thorough research.

860
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:22,960
Sir, the official story

861
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:25,920
is that the Parks Department
and local councilman

862
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:28,920
built that park
with your backing,

863
01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:31,930
but wasn't it really
Mr. Watanabe?

864
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,550
That's the word.

865
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:36,890
Mr. Watanabe
was chief of Public Affairs.

866
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:40,230
Building parks is
the Park Department's job.

867
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,060
We understand that.

868
01:34:42,230 --> 01:34:45,320
But the plan almost
fizzled out several times.

869
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:48,610
We're talking about the man
who saw it to completion.

870
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:52,410
Local residents believe that
that was Mr. Watanabe.

871
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:54,780
They're deeply concerned
about the fact

872
01:34:54,950 --> 01:34:57,290
that he died
in the park he built.

873
01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:59,450
What's that supposed
to mean?

874
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:03,290
Well, they were suspicious
even before that happened.

875
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:07,590
For example, in your speech
at the park's opening ceremony,

876
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,630
you never mentioned
Mr. Watanabe once.

877
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,090
They say it wasn't
a congratulatory address.

878
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:14,680
Then what was it?

879
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:16,850
A campaign speech.

880
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,270
Furthermore...

881
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,060
he was completely ignored
during the ceremony

882
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:26,320
and seated
in the back corner.

883
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:30,610
In short, people feel
a lot of sympathy for the guy.

884
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:33,280
So the fact that
he died in the park

885
01:35:33,450 --> 01:35:35,530
has led to some
interesting speculation.

886
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:40,410
It's seen
as an act of silent protest

887
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:42,620
against top city officials.

888
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:47,130
So you're saying
Watanabe committed suicide

889
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:51,630
or at least let himself
freeze to death?

890
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,430
More or less.

891
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:56,590
I see.

892
01:35:57,010 --> 01:35:59,680
Don't forget it was also
snowing last night.

893
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:02,810
Sounds like a scene
right out of a play.

894
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:03,980
However...

895
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:08,320
an autopsy
has clearly established

896
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:11,070
the cause
of Watanabe's death.

897
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:15,320
He certainly didn't commit suicide.
Nor did he freeze to death.

898
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:18,660
- He died of stomach cancer.
- Stomach cancer?

899
01:36:18,990 --> 01:36:21,870
That's right.
Internal hemorrhaging.

900
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:26,540
Watanabe died suddenly,
without warning.

901
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:28,920
If you have any doubts...

902
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:32,840
Ono, give them
the name of the hospital.

903
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:49,210
It's just not right.

904
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:54,300
The way these reporters think,
and their tactlessness...

905
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,260
Actually...

906
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:59,340
it applies
to the general public too.

907
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:05,560
They just don't understand
how government works.

908
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:12,820
They're woefully ignorant
of how we function.

909
01:38:13,150 --> 01:38:16,570
Take that little park in Κuroe.

910
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:19,870
Some seem to believe

911
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:22,030
that Watanabe built it,

912
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:24,330
but that's ridiculous.

913
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:27,120
Maybe I shouldn't say this

914
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:31,000
here at his wake,

915
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:34,840
in front of his son
and relatives...

916
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,930
but I'll go ahead,

917
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:41,140
because I think Watanabe
would agree with me.

918
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:46,480
Certainly, Watanabe
went to great pains

919
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:49,940
to get that park built.

920
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:53,900
I take my hat off
to his enthusiasm.

921
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:58,990
But his efforts were part
of his official duties.

922
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:06,370
The idea he went beyond
the scope of his office

923
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:08,750
to facilitate citizens' desires

924
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:12,000
and actually built
the park himself

925
01:39:12,170 --> 01:39:15,420
is nonsense to those
who understand our bureaucracy.

926
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:22,010
Watanabe himself
would grimace at the idea.

927
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:29,390
However...

928
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,310
we may be partly to blame

929
01:39:33,570 --> 01:39:36,860
for the fact
people are saying such things.

930
01:39:37,150 --> 01:39:39,610
All eyes were on
that epoch-making project

931
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:42,070
as it was rushed
to completion.

932
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:45,740
Maybe we should have
singled out someone's service.

933
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,700
For instance...

934
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:50,500
the chief
of the Parks Department.

935
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:53,590
Or his superior...

936
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:56,960
the chief of Public Works.

937
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:02,180
If you say so,
Mr. Deputy Mayor,

938
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:04,430
but here's what I think.

939
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,850
The head
of the Parks Department and I

940
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:10,520
only fulfilled the duties
of our offices.

941
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:14,270
But when I think
how difficult it was

942
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:19,150
to navigate the intricate politics
of the city council

943
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:22,110
and realize
the park's construction,

944
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:26,080
it is you, Deputy Mayor,
who should be singled out.

945
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:29,080
Now, now...

946
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:32,960
Some people
have even criticized

947
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:35,290
my speech
at the opening ceremony.

948
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,170
Isn't that right, Ono?

949
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:40,380
They called it
a campaign speech!

950
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:47,220
Excuse me.
The residents of Κuroe

951
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:51,140
are here asking to burn incense
for the deceased.

952
01:42:56,810 --> 01:42:59,770
Κiichi, come.
You too, Mitsuo.

953
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:06,150
It sure is cold.

954
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,780
May I pour one for you?

955
01:45:10,610 --> 01:45:12,820
I'll get some warm sake.

956
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:15,080
What do you say?

957
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:18,750
Why don't you all move
closer down here?

958
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:20,330
Why not?

959
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,000
- Over here, please.
- Thanks.

960
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:26,920
Mr. Hayashi.

961
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,020
Mr. Ono.

962
01:45:46,610 --> 01:45:49,490
Did all the big shots
go off to a meeting?

963
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:50,740
Yes.

964
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:55,120
No, they just couldn't stand
to stay here.

965
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,240
I don't care
what anyone says.

966
01:45:59,370 --> 01:46:02,670
It was Mr. Watanabe
who built that park.

967
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:06,840
The deputy mayor
and his people know it.

968
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:11,010
That's going too far.
As the deputy mayor said...

969
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:12,630
That's right.

970
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:15,760
I'm not saying this because
I'm in the Parks Department,

971
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:19,350
but we drew up the plans
and oversaw construction.

972
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:23,940
- That's not what I meant.
- Now, now...

973
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,980
I understand
how you feel, but...

974
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:30,030
The point is
he was in Public Affairs.

975
01:46:30,190 --> 01:46:33,990
Did he think
he could just build a park?

976
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:36,370
We have to respect
each other's turf or...

977
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:39,790
If I had to say
how that park got built,

978
01:46:39,950 --> 01:46:42,660
I'd say it was coincidence.

979
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:44,500
Hear me out.

980
01:46:44,670 --> 01:46:49,170
If a looming election hadn't put
pressure on the local councilman,

981
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,260
and if profiteers hadn't lobbied

982
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,930
to build
a red-light district there,

983
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:58,890
that reclamation work
wouldn't have proceeded so quickly.

984
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:00,390
That's right.

985
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,600
Exactly right.

986
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:06,350
There's one thing
I can't figure out.

987
01:47:07,690 --> 01:47:12,150
Why would
someone like him

988
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:15,200
suddenly change like that?

989
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:18,990
What could it have been?

990
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:25,080
I agree.
It's a complete mystery.

991
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:27,000
It really is.

992
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:29,090
I mean...

993
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:32,460
with the benefit of hindsight,

994
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:35,800
it would seem he knew

995
01:47:35,930 --> 01:47:38,600
he had stomach cancer,
and that's why...

996
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:41,930
We were just discussing

997
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:45,270
whether your father knew
he had stomach cancer.

998
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:48,810
Well, I think he would have
told me if he did.

999
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:50,110
Indeed.

1000
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:53,190
I believe my father
was fortunate to die

1001
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:55,820
without realizing
he had cancer.

1002
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:58,700
A diagnosis like that
is a death sentence.

1003
01:47:58,870 --> 01:48:00,070
I see.

1004
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:02,910
Well, that rules out
Saito's theory.

1005
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:05,040
What theory is that?

1006
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:09,420
Well, five months ago he went
through a sudden transformation.

1007
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:11,250
That's for sure.

1008
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:15,380
And none of us has
any clue what caused it.

1009
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,340
Well, that was
a woman's doing.

1010
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:21,260
With a young mistress,

1011
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:25,270
the hormonal effect can temporarily
rejuvenate an old man.

1012
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:27,440
Happens all the time.

1013
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,110
It suddenly put a sheen
back on his cheeks.

1014
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:32,470
Actually...

1015
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:36,070
we heard rumors
at that time of a romance.

1016
01:48:36,490 --> 01:48:38,990
That explains
the rakish hat.

1017
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:40,530
Sure does.

1018
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:43,620
That surprised
the hell out of me.

1019
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Sir, I'm not sure
that's possible.

1020
01:48:50,170 --> 01:48:52,920
It is if you set your mind to it.

1021
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,220
But wait.

1022
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:42,220
In any case,

1023
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:46,640
his enthusiasm
was a bit over the top.

1024
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:49,190
Yes. That's very true.

1025
01:49:50,190 --> 01:49:52,100
I don't mean to argue,

1026
01:49:52,230 --> 01:49:56,070
but a woman alone
can't account for...

1027
01:49:56,190 --> 01:49:57,860
- But...
- Dear.

1028
01:49:58,030 --> 01:50:00,360
The thing is...

1029
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:05,200
it just doesn't make sense.

1030
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:12,370
Not to change the subject,

1031
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:16,050
but there were times
when his extraordinary zeal

1032
01:50:16,170 --> 01:50:18,340
threatened to derail it all.

1033
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:22,220
That's city hall for you.
Gotta guard your turf.

1034
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:25,970
That's right.
The biggest mystery to me

1035
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:29,640
is how a 30-year veteran
could suddenly forget the rules.

1036
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:31,770
It's because he...

1037
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:39,530
In any event...

1038
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:43,240
pushing his plan
on all the other departments

1039
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:47,240
ensured that everyone
would dig in their heels.

1040
01:50:47,410 --> 01:50:50,000
My boss was
none too happy about it.

1041
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:53,290
Building parks is
the Parks Department's job.

1042
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:57,920
We have our own proposals
for new parks.

1043
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:01,090
Couldn't you reconsider?

1044
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:03,760
This site is really terrible.

1045
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:07,010
But building a park
isn't as simple

1046
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:10,100
as you outline
in your proposal.

1047
01:51:10,270 --> 01:51:12,810
No, this proposal is just...

1048
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:14,560
I understand.

1049
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:16,610
Tell you what:

1050
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:19,570
I'll study
your proposal thoroughly.

1051
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:27,280
But you know,
in the end

1052
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:30,790
even the parks chief caved in
to Watanabe's tenacity...

1053
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:32,620
You've got a point there.

1054
01:51:32,790 --> 01:51:35,080
He really didn't know
what to do.

1055
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:42,320
He really was something.

1056
01:52:42,490 --> 01:52:45,570
He would wait days
for the answer he wanted.

1057
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:47,990
Our section chief
would sneak away

1058
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:50,330
the second
he saw Watanabe's face.

1059
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:51,620
That's right.

1060
01:53:03,010 --> 01:53:05,810
Section Chief!

1061
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:12,720
He even pleaded
with underlings like me.

1062
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:15,430
It was unbelievable!

1063
01:53:15,730 --> 01:53:18,020
Won't you please...?

1064
01:53:20,730 --> 01:53:22,730
Isn't there some way...?

1065
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:48,180
Finally we couldn't
stand by any longer.

1066
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:53,510
That's right.
We took pity on him too.

1067
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:57,350
But you guys
in General Affairs

1068
01:53:57,940 --> 01:54:00,100
were the worst of all.

1069
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:01,940
Wait a minute!

1070
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:05,360
I went around with him,
so I know.

1071
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:09,030
You made us beg for two weeks.
I won't forget that.

1072
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:11,280
Sorry about that.

1073
01:54:12,030 --> 01:54:13,790
However...

1074
01:54:13,950 --> 01:54:16,500
remember
the most surprising thing?

1075
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:22,210
- Oh, right.
- That was a shocker.

1076
01:54:56,620 --> 01:54:59,210
DEPUTY MAYOR'S OFFICE

1077
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:10,510
But you know
what was even more surprising?

1078
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:12,840
The incident
in the deputy mayor's office?

1079
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:16,640
- I heard about that!
- That was something!

1080
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:23,100
A section chief openly
defying the deputy mayor...

1081
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:25,400
unprecedented
at City Hall!

1082
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:37,990
Listen,
about that new park...

1083
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:41,210
it's one thing
to show initiative,

1084
01:55:41,370 --> 01:55:45,880
but you don't want people
thinking you're a publicity hound.

1085
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:50,220
And the city council's
got problems of its own.

1086
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:55,180
I think it's best
just to let the proposal die.

1087
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:59,980
Last night there was
a banquet at Nakagawa.

1088
01:56:00,230 --> 01:56:03,560
I tell you, geisha
these days are appalling.

1089
01:56:03,730 --> 01:56:06,320
One of them
spent the evening sulking

1090
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,230
and didn't say a word.

1091
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:12,410
The proprietress said she was
a student working part-time!

1092
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:15,620
That's a good one!

1093
01:56:21,370 --> 01:56:24,420
Couldn't you please...

1094
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:28,420
reconsider the proposal?

1095
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:37,260
What did you just say?

1096
01:56:43,770 --> 01:56:45,270
I mean...

1097
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:50,110
about that park...

1098
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:55,200
won't you reconsider
your decision?

1099
01:57:38,990 --> 01:57:41,120
But the thing is,

1100
01:57:41,290 --> 01:57:43,710
when you look at the results,

1101
01:57:43,870 --> 01:57:45,920
was it worth taking it that far?

1102
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:48,290
No, it was crazy!

1103
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:52,800
Everyone at City Hall
is guarding his own turf.

1104
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:57,840
But didn't the deputy mayor
end up reconsidering?

1105
01:57:57,970 --> 01:58:00,260
That's because
the councilman needled him.

1106
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:02,180
It was just coincidence.

1107
01:58:02,350 --> 01:58:05,600
You're attributing everything
to Watanabe's "zeal."

1108
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:08,020
Don't be so sentimental!

1109
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,730
Sentimental!

1110
01:58:10,190 --> 01:58:13,360
Is that so?
I don't see it that way.

1111
01:58:14,360 --> 01:58:17,660
If all of you can't
understand his dedication,

1112
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:19,570
the world's
a dark place indeed.

1113
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:21,540
It is a dark place.

1114
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:28,460
From just looking
at Mr. Watanabe you could tell

1115
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:32,710
that only his work
was keeping him alive.

1116
01:58:33,590 --> 01:58:36,050
Didn't it look
that way to you?

1117
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:40,390
Sometimes it even
gave me chills.

1118
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:44,350
When was it?

1119
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:46,270
I was...

1120
01:59:31,110 --> 01:59:34,360
That reminds me
of when I'd see him

1121
01:59:34,530 --> 01:59:36,400
at the construction site.

1122
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,880
That look in his eyes!

1123
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:19,420
As if he were watching
his child or grandchild,

1124
02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:22,260
the apple of his eye.

1125
02:01:22,470 --> 02:01:24,220
Of course.

1126
02:01:24,510 --> 02:01:27,430
He nurtured that park
like you would a child.

1127
02:01:27,930 --> 02:01:29,640
So what are you saying?

1128
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:34,560
Like I said before:

1129
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:38,900
Whatever anyone says,
Mr. Watanabe built that park...

1130
02:01:39,070 --> 02:01:42,280
But if the councilman
and deputy mayor

1131
02:01:42,450 --> 02:01:44,530
hadn't been facing
reelection,

1132
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:47,030
the plan wouldn't
have become a reality.

1133
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:51,410
Watanabe had no role
in what was going on higher up.

1134
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:54,080
That's not actually true.

1135
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:55,650
Really?

1136
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:58,960
The folks who wanted
that red-light district

1137
02:01:59,130 --> 02:02:03,430
definitely thought Watanabe was
blocking their way. Listen to this:

1138
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:21,940
Section Chief.

1139
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:26,450
Are you Section Chief
of Public Affairs?

1140
02:02:26,570 --> 02:02:27,570
Yes.

1141
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:34,410
Just the man
I wanted to see.

1142
02:02:36,830 --> 02:02:40,340
Old man, you'd better
mind your own business.

1143
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:44,010
Just what
are you trying to...

1144
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:45,930
Don't play dumb!

1145
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:52,270
No hard feelings.

1146
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:55,020
Just shut up and back off.

1147
02:02:58,020 --> 02:02:59,610
Say something!

1148
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:01,690
You value your life?

1149
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:24,050
This is Watanabe.

1150
02:04:42,130 --> 02:04:44,210
I just don't get it.

1151
02:04:45,010 --> 02:04:48,800
Why would
someone like him...

1152
02:04:48,970 --> 02:04:51,140
I just don't...

1153
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:54,660
get it.

1154
02:05:03,070 --> 02:05:07,490
No, I'm sure Mr. Watanabe knew
he had stomach cancer.

1155
02:05:07,650 --> 02:05:08,650
But...

1156
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:14,490
I just suddenly
remembered something.

1157
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:31,010
This is too much!

1158
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,350
We've been at this
for two weeks.

1159
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:35,510
We've explained it
to them 20 times.

1160
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:38,430
They could at least tell us
if there are funds.

1161
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:42,600
General Affairs is just being sadistic.
It's not like it's their personal money.

1162
02:05:42,770 --> 02:05:44,860
Why can't they be
more agreeable?

1163
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:46,730
Well, you know...

1164
02:05:46,900 --> 02:05:49,280
Doesn't it make you furious

1165
02:05:49,530 --> 02:05:52,030
to be treated
with such contempt?

1166
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:54,700
No.

1167
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:58,370
I can't afford to hate people.

1168
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:04,130
I haven't got
that kind of time.

1169
02:06:21,070 --> 02:06:22,070
You mean...

1170
02:06:22,170 --> 02:06:25,270
Wait!
Now that you mention it...

1171
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:28,110
that reminds me...

1172
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,740
of something.

1173
02:06:47,050 --> 02:06:49,760
How beautiful!

1174
02:06:58,020 --> 02:06:59,970
Truly beautiful.

1175
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:04,740
A sunset.

1176
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:08,520
I don't think I've really
looked at one in 30 years.

1177
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:19,330
But I haven't got time
for this now.

1178
02:07:25,130 --> 02:07:26,730
He knew!

1179
02:07:27,290 --> 02:07:30,130
He knew he didn't have
long left to live...

1180
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:33,470
It makes everything
clear as day.

1181
02:07:33,630 --> 02:07:35,340
There's no other explanation.

1182
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:38,640
That explains
his extraordinary passion

1183
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:41,180
and his strange behavior.

1184
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:43,730
Now what he did
makes perfect sense!

1185
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:46,480
Absolutely.
We'd have done the same.

1186
02:07:50,990 --> 02:07:54,400
But any of us
could die at any moment.

1187
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:09,170
Listen...

1188
02:08:10,170 --> 02:08:13,570
Subsection Chief.

1189
02:08:17,180 --> 02:08:19,390
I mean you...

1190
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:23,270
the new Section Chief
of Public Affairs.

1191
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:30,730
Section Chief!
Are you listening?

1192
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:35,030
I haven't been promoted yet.

1193
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:44,710
See here!

1194
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:48,000
- Ono!
- Cut it out.

1195
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:51,590
What did you say
a minute ago?

1196
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:56,550
"We'd have done the same."

1197
02:08:58,390 --> 02:09:00,300
Don't make me laugh.

1198
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:02,220
Hey, that's enough now.

1199
02:09:02,390 --> 02:09:06,940
You think you could have done
what Mr. Watanabe did?

1200
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:10,900
Don't make me laugh.

1201
02:09:11,570 --> 02:09:14,440
Listen, Ohara...

1202
02:09:15,650 --> 02:09:18,450
the thing is...

1203
02:09:20,410 --> 02:09:23,080
I may look dumb, but...

1204
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:25,250
Don't you think...

1205
02:09:25,410 --> 02:09:29,630
Okay, I only went
to night school...

1206
02:09:29,830 --> 02:09:35,170
- so I'll never make section chief!
- Watanabe was a great man!

1207
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:38,340
No, great's not the right word.

1208
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:41,180
- But you, Ono?
- What's the right word?

1209
02:09:41,350 --> 02:09:45,180
- Don't make me laugh.
- Compared to him...

1210
02:09:45,850 --> 02:09:49,850
Compared to Mr. Watanabe,
the rest of us...

1211
02:09:51,650 --> 02:09:54,320
We're worthless scum!

1212
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:59,120
Including you!

1213
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:01,450
That's going too far.

1214
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:06,950
We may be scum...

1215
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:12,880
but some of us start out
at City Hall as good people.

1216
02:10:13,210 --> 02:10:16,130
But the longer you stay...

1217
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:18,130
I didn't used to be...

1218
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:24,560
You're not supposed to do
anything at City Hall.

1219
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:28,140
Doing anything
is considered radical!

1220
02:10:28,310 --> 02:10:31,860
We have to act like we're doing
something while doing nothing.

1221
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:34,980
- That's right.
- In our department too!

1222
02:10:35,150 --> 02:10:37,150
The thing is,

1223
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:41,360
just to get a garbage can
somewhere emptied out,

1224
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:45,990
you need enough paperwork
to fill another garbage can.

1225
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:48,160
That's exactly right!

1226
02:10:48,330 --> 02:10:50,170
Seal after seal after seal!

1227
02:10:50,290 --> 02:10:52,000
That's just an excuse.

1228
02:10:52,170 --> 02:10:54,540
We waste people's
valuable time.

1229
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:58,670
The public is upset by bribes
and 40,000 cars and so on,

1230
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:01,010
but those are just farts

1231
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:04,180
next to this invisible,
colossal waste of time!

1232
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:09,600
Listen here.

1233
02:11:09,730 --> 02:11:12,350
I often have
the same concerns.

1234
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:16,860
But in that labyrinthine machine,
you can't do a thing!

1235
02:11:17,030 --> 02:11:20,200
All that meaningless busywork
and not a moment to think!

1236
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:21,530
Idiots!

1237
02:11:30,870 --> 02:11:34,080
But the thing is,

1238
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:35,710
Mr. Ohara,

1239
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:38,050
even within a system

1240
02:11:38,210 --> 02:11:41,340
where you can't get
a thing done,

1241
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:44,760
and battling
stomach cancer at that,

1242
02:11:44,930 --> 02:11:49,020
Mr. Watanabe managed
to accomplish so much.

1243
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:53,560
That's it!
That's what I wanted to say!

1244
02:11:53,730 --> 02:11:56,230
That's why I get so angry!

1245
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:58,480
That's what I'm saying!

1246
02:11:58,650 --> 02:12:01,400
Mr. Watanabe
expected no reward!

1247
02:12:01,530 --> 02:12:03,820
That's right!

1248
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:07,660
When you imagine how he must
have felt, his life on the line...

1249
02:12:07,830 --> 02:12:10,250
Anyone who tries to take
the credit isn't human!

1250
02:12:10,410 --> 02:12:12,670
The deputy mayor.
Just say it!

1251
02:12:17,210 --> 02:12:19,630
That's going too far...

1252
02:12:27,850 --> 02:12:29,250
Listen.

1253
02:12:29,770 --> 02:12:34,980
How do you think he felt...

1254
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:39,440
dying all alone in that park?

1255
02:12:39,990 --> 02:12:42,780
Just thinking about it...

1256
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:09,890
A policeman brought this by.
He found it in the park.

1257
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:20,570
And he'd like to light incense
for the deceased.

1258
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:42,500
Thank you for taking the trouble.
Come in.

1259
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:43,900
Won't you stay a bit
and have a drink?

1260
02:14:44,070 --> 02:14:46,400
We appreciate
your coming out of your way.

1261
02:14:48,070 --> 02:14:51,270
Please sit down.

1262
02:15:16,930 --> 02:15:18,770
To tell you the truth...

1263
02:15:24,190 --> 02:15:27,190
last night I was...

1264
02:15:27,990 --> 02:15:30,390
on patrol...

1265
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:33,950
in the new park...

1266
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:39,670
when I came across him.

1267
02:15:40,630 --> 02:15:43,290
It was 10:00... no.

1268
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:47,630
Nearly 11:00.

1269
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:50,180
He was on the swing...

1270
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:55,470
even though it was snowing.

1271
02:15:56,140 --> 02:15:58,810
I just assumed
he was some drunk.

1272
02:16:02,230 --> 02:16:04,980
I was derelict in my duty.

1273
02:16:10,410 --> 02:16:15,410
If I'd followed my first inclination
and taken him in,

1274
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:18,410
this wouldn't have happened.

1275
02:16:20,330 --> 02:16:23,330
What I did was unforgivable.

1276
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:29,670
But he seemed to be...

1277
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:34,760
so perfectly happy.
I can't explain it.

1278
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:40,430
He poured his whole heart
into that song of his...

1279
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:47,860
with a haunting voice...

1280
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:51,860
that filled...

1281
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:58,120
the depths of my soul.

1282
02:17:02,370 --> 02:17:04,970
Life is brief

1283
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:17,960
Fall in love, maidens

1284
02:17:24,230 --> 02:17:29,030
Before the crimson bloom

1285
02:17:35,490 --> 02:17:39,490
Fades from your lips

1286
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:51,570
Before the tides of passion

1287
02:17:57,430 --> 02:18:00,430
Cool within you

1288
02:18:07,770 --> 02:18:10,970
For those of you

1289
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:23,040
Who know no tomorrow

1290
02:18:47,980 --> 02:18:50,650
Listen, last night...

1291
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:53,490
under the stairs,

1292
02:18:53,650 --> 02:18:56,200
I found a pouch
with my name on it.

1293
02:18:56,570 --> 02:18:59,450
Inside were
Dad's bankbook and seal,

1294
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:04,080
along with forms for claiming
his retirement bonus.

1295
02:19:04,540 --> 02:19:07,330
So he left it
before he went to the park?

1296
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:10,840
It was so cruel of him...

1297
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:14,880
not to tell us he had cancer.
If I'd known sooner...

1298
02:19:15,930 --> 02:19:19,600
Hey, why didn't
his girlfriend show up?

1299
02:19:20,510 --> 02:19:23,470
I wonder if she really was
his girlfriend after all.

1300
02:19:28,020 --> 02:19:29,520
I'll do my best!

1301
02:19:29,690 --> 02:19:32,020
- I swear it!
- We must carry on his work!

1302
02:19:32,190 --> 02:19:35,700
We can't let
his death be in vain!

1303
02:19:36,860 --> 02:19:40,240
I'll be like a man reborn!

1304
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:50,790
We'll sacrifice ourselves
in the service of the people!

1305
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:56,970
Never forget this feeling!

1306
02:19:57,130 --> 02:19:59,550
I'm going to do my best!

1307
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:07,730
PUBLIC AFFAIRS
SECTION CHIEF

1308
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:17,440
Sir...

1309
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:21,910
the sewage main break in Κisaki
is overflowing into Takao.

1310
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:23,830
Public Works.

1311
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:31,750
Please go to Public Works.

1312
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:33,320
Desk 8.

1313
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:51,560
Κenbo! Yoko!

1314
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:56,340
Come in for dinner!

1315
02:22:51,730 --> 02:22:53,130
THE END
