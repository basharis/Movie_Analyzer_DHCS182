Wong Kar-Wai

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
It is a restless moment.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,680
She has kept her head lowered,

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,440
to give him a chance to come closer.

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
But he could not,
for lack of courage,

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,360
she turns and walks away.

Eat up, the fish
is very fresh today...

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,960
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,520
Never mind, let's sit over here.

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,240
It's quite late!

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,160
I've just finished work.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,280
What should I call you?

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,920
You can call me Mrs. Suen.

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,840
- And you?
- My husband's name is Chan.

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,760
- Call me when you decide.
- I will.

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,880
Did you write down my number?

27
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
Yes, I did.

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,880
Fine, I'll see you out.

29
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,400
- Don't trouble.
- No trouble!

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,920
So it's agreed then!

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,400
Thank you very much!
I should go.

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,480
- Fine.
- Bye!

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,920
Take care, goodbye!

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,960
You've a room to let?

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,720
Sorry, it's just been rented
to that lady.

36
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Thanks anyway.

37
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,320
How many of you?

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,320
Just me and my wife.

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,920
- Why don't you try next door?
- They've a vacant room too?

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,760
Yes, Mr. Koo's son got married...
His room's empty.

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,120
Thank you.

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,360
- You're too polite. Try asking them.
- Thank you.

43
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,400
This way, come on.

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,880
Not that room!

45
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,760
Oops, wrong again!

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,280
Careful! Against the wall there.

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,320
The little cupboard over there.

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,680
Be careful!

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,160
Don't break anything!

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,280
Not on top of the radio!

51
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,880
Mr. Chow...

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,480
You have a lot of stuff
for a couple!

53
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,840
- The wardrobe isn't mine.
- Wrong again?

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,000
It goes next door.

55
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,040
Okay, next door.

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,320
These aren't my shoes!
They must go next door.

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,200
What a coincidence!
Moving in on the same day!

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,200
Is Mr. Chan here?

59
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,440
He's working abroad.
He'll be back next week.

60
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,800
You should have waited, then.

61
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,840
It's too much for you on your own.

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,560
- I can manage.
- I'll ask Amah to help.

63
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,440
No need, I can manage.

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,120
What's going on?

65
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Mind that mirror!

66
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,480
Mrs. Chan, I'll leave you to it.

67
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,880
- Those books aren't mine.
- Wrong again?

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,560
Never mind,
just leave them there.

69
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,280
Mind how you hang the mirror,
it's fragile!

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,120
Are these magazines yours?

71
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,840
Yes, they're my husband's.

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,720
He reads Japanese?

73
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,960
A little, his boss is Japanese.

74
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,560
How should I address you?

75
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,800
My husband's name is Chan.

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,560
My name's Chow...
I'll leave you in peace.

77
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you, Mr. Chow.

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,440
Don't mention it.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,440
I'll ask Mrs. Chan...

80
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,480
Mrs. Chan,
eat with us before you go!

81
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
No thanks,
I must dash to the airport.

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,400
- Your husband's coming back?
- Yes.

83
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,200
Then I won't keep you.

84
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,680
- Going out?
- Yes.

85
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,280
Sorry, I'm late!

86
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,680
Amah, pour some beer.

87
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,520
Cheers!

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,960
Mrs. Chow,
try some Shanghai dishes.

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
Where is Mrs. Chan off to so late?

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,800
Meeting her husband at the airport.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,800
So that's why she looks different.

92
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,440
It's all packed,
take care on your trip.

93
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,920
I will.

94
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,400
How long this time?

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,560
Two to four weeks.

96
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,280
Remember to bring back
two more of those handbags.

97
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,440
Who for?

98
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,560
My boss.

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,040
Two of them?

100
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
You know why.

101
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,600
Different colors?

102
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,080
The same will do! Who cares?

103
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,160
Whatever!

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,640
Mrs. Ho.
Mr. Ho is still in a meeting.

105
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,840
He'll be home late...
Please don't wait to eat.

106
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,840
Yes, we're so busy at the moment.

107
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,760
Yes, I'll ask him to call you
when he gets back.

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,080
Did you call my wife?

109
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,800
Yes, I said you'd be back later.

110
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,120
- Have you booked the restaurant?
- A table for two at eight.

111
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,360
Miss Yu called
to say she's on her way.

112
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,440
I'll be back after dinner,
can I bring you something?

113
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,760
No thanks, I'll get my own.

114
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,960
Leave when you're ready,
I'll lock up.

115
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,160
- Good evening, Mr. Ho!
- Evening!

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,200
- Going out, Mrs. Chan?
- Yes.

117
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,880
Going out so late?

118
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,760
Just getting some noodles.

119
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,480
Amah is making pork soup, join us.

120
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,480
Thanks, I'm not really hungry,
I just want some air.

121
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,560
You're too polite.

122
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,120
Next time!

123
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,440
They're all starving, we can eat.

124
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,200
Have you spoken to Ming?

125
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,680
So I'll go with someone else!

126
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,640
Just kidding!

127
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,960
I'll be early tonight, see you soon!

128
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,760
Chow!

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Coming!

130
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,720
Time to go! Finish it tomorrow!

131
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,440
No, I'm nearly there...

132
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,880
Oh, Ming...

133
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,360
- I need a few days off next month.
- Why?

134
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,840
I promised my wife a trip.
Put in a word for me, will you?

135
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,880
I'll speak to personnel.

136
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,960
But the next lunch is on you.

137
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,200
I will.

138
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,680
Thanks, Ming!

139
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,000
It's ready!

140
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,240
No, it'll switch itself off!

141
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
I told you, it's not ready!

142
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,160
A rice cooker!
It's yours, Mrs. Koo?

143
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,000
No, it's beyond us!
It's Mrs. Chan's.

144
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,000
My husband brought it from Japan.

145
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,960
I wanted to show Mrs. Koo
how good it is.

146
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,880
Now it's ready!

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,960
Mrs. Chan...

148
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,160
Could Mr. Chan get me one
next time?

149
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,400
No problem!

150
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,440
Mr. Chow, you should get one too!

151
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,600
Your wife's so often late home.

152
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,760
I couldn't trouble Mr. Chan.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,120
It's just neighborly, isn't it?

154
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,720
It's no trouble! I'll ask him
to buy another next time.

155
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,360
Thank you!

156
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,680
Let's try the rice.

157
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,360
Mr. Chan, sorry to trouble you
about the rice cooker.

158
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,400
It was really no trouble.

159
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,880
How much do I owe you?

160
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,000
Your wife has already paid me.

161
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,240
Really?

162
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,920
She didn't tell you?

163
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,920
She's been working late shifts.

164
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,160
Often I'm asleep when she gets back.

165
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,960
It must be hard for her.

166
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,760
Yes.
Mrs. Chan isn't back yet?

167
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,120
She'll be back soon...
You need to talk to her?

168
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,640
A friend needs to go to Singapore.

169
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,040
I wonder if she could get
a cheap ticket for him.

170
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,080
I'll ask when she gets back.

171
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,040
I'm bothering you too much.

172
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,200
Don't mention it, we're neighbors!

173
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,440
I'll leave you in peace.

174
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,720
Looking for me?

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,800
Damn right, where've you been?

176
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,600
What's up?

177
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,960
Mrs. Chan called,
you left a hat at her office.

178
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,880
I meant to!
I wanted an excuse to go back.

179
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,880
I know your tricks!

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,400
She's married.

181
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,400
I know, that's why I left.

182
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,520
Otherwise I'd move in next door.

183
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,320
If your wife wasn't so attractive,
she'd be a worried woman!

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
I'm not like you.

185
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,400
Please call Mrs. Chan for me.

186
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,680
I'll pick up the hat tomorrow.
And take her to lunch!

187
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,640
Dream on!

188
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,520
She'll take the hat home.
I'll bring it in tomorrow.

189
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,960
You're kidding!
Some buddy you are!

190
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,640
Tell you what,
let's go pick her up now!

191
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,360
She should be off work by now.
We can go together!

192
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,480
I don't have time for this.

193
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,520
Chow!

194
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,200
Yes! Get out of here, I'm busy.

195
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,040
Then I'll wait at your place.

196
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,920
Ping!

197
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,560
Mr. Chow, is Mr. Koo in?

198
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,560
He's out...
Forgot to buy the paper again?

199
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,280
- That's right, I'll stop by later.
- Maybe I can find it for you.

200
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,960
Thank you.

201
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,760
- This one?
- Yes.

202
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,320
I always loved those serials,
hated to miss an episode.

203
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,440
Really? You liked them too?

204
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,080
I even thought of writing one!

205
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,520
Why didn't you?

206
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,200
I couldn't get started,
so I gave up.

207
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,480
I wasn't born
to write martial arts stories!

208
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,800
But you can borrow
from my collection anytime.

209
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,840
Not now, maybe another time.
Thanks.

210
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,560
You're welcome!

211
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,120
What is it? Mrs. Chan!

212
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,920
I just want to return these
to Mr. Chow. Is he in?

213
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,080
He's been away for a few days.

214
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,400
Why?

215
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,360
They had a quarrel.

216
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,200
Leave them with me,
I'll pass them back to him.

217
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,120
Thank you.

218
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,560
Forget it!

219
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,120
I'm on a replacement shift tonight.

220
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,720
Talk to you later.

221
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,280
No need to pick me up!

222
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,680
She's already left.

223
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,560
Really? I was going
to take her out for supper.

224
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,800
Didn't she tell you
she was off early today?

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,600
She never remembers to tell me.

226
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,280
Maybe she's home by now.

227
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,680
- I'll be off, then.
- Okay, bye!

228
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Hello!

229
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,600
You're out of hospital!

230
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,280
Don't mention hospital!
Lend me $30!

231
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,600
What for?

232
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,760
You gotta help me save face!

233
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,120
What's the big deal?

234
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,680
It's Ah Hoi's fault.

235
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,040
He gave me a racing tip,
said it was a sure thing.

236
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,880
Before they'd taken out
the stitches...

237
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,280
I bet everything I had.

238
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,880
And I lost my shirt!

239
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,040
What did you expect?

240
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,840
I thought it was my lucky day.

241
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,880
Anyhow, I had only $2 left.

242
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,640
So I went to the whorehouse.

243
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,760
You were in no shape for sex!

244
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,360
I thought it would improve my luck.

245
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,320
What would $2 buy you?

246
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,600
I'm Kwai-fei's regular,
she gives me credit.

247
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,520
You can have it on credit?

248
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,240
I left my ID card and said
I'd be back to redeem it.

249
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,960
I thought a few dollars
would be easy to rustle up.

250
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
But so far nothing
I'm way overdue.

251
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,120
So?

252
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,200
Four Eyes was there yesterday.

253
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,680
Saw her waving my ID around
in front of everyone.

254
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,800
So embarrassing!

255
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,960
Anyway, lend me $30!

256
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,760
This is all I can spare.

257
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,680
I need $10 for myself.

258
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,120
Pay you back next month.

259
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,120
- Let's have a late snack.
- What?

260
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,200
All I've had today
is some won-ton noodles.

261
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,360
Let me finish writing this first.

262
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,680
I'm not sure
I should tell you this...

263
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,960
What?

264
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,520
I saw your wife
in the street yesterday.

265
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,360
So what?

266
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,840
She was with some guy.

267
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,920
Probably a friend.

268
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,480
Just thought you should know.

269
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,080
Miss Yu? This is me.

270
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,000
Mr. Ho's still in a meeting.
He says he can't manage dinner.

271
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,720
Yes, we're very busy now.

272
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,680
I will.

273
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,240
I'll ask Mr. Ho to call.

274
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,120
- Have you called Miss Yu?
- Yes, I have.

275
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,560
What did she say?

276
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,720
Asks you to call her later.

277
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,200
And Mrs. Ho says she's ready
to cut her birthday cake.

278
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,600
She wants you to hurry home.

279
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,200
- Did you get me a present for her?
- Yes, this.

280
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,160
- What is it?
- A scarf.

281
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,560
- I think Mrs. Ho will like it.
- Thank you.

282
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,040
And here's your change.

283
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm always troubling you,
use it for bus fare.

284
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,600
Why don't you dine with us tonight?

285
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,800
Thank you, I've already planned
to see a film tonight.

286
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,680
Then I won't keep you.

287
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Tomorrow will be quiet,
take the morning off.

288
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,520
Are you going out tonight?

289
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,080
Don't forget your keys.

290
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,760
All the neighbors
are dining out tonight.

291
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,600
I have a lot to do here,
I'll be late.

292
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,920
What is it, Mrs. Chan?

293
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,440
I heard voices,

294
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,920
I thought Mr. And Mrs. Koo
were back.

295
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,920
Not yet, anything I can help with?

296
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,880
No, I just wanted a chat.

297
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,960
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I am.

298
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,960
You're back early today!

299
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,560
I came back to rest.
I'm not feeling well...

300
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,880
What is it?
I have some medicines...

301
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,720
Don't trouble yourself,
I'll sleep it off.

302
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,480
In that case,
I'll leave you in peace.

303
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,320
It was your wife.

304
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,440
Have you spoken to your wife yet?

305
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,320
Then we shouldn't meet any more.

306
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,880
Any news from the Philippines?

307
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,200
Yes, a telex.

308
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,160
There's a typhoon,
so the ship's still docked.

309
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,680
Please inform Chan
that the shipment may be delayed.

310
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,640
Ask if that's a problem.

311
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,960
Your wife rang.
You don't need to pick her up.

312
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,880
She's playing mahjong with Mrs. Lau.

313
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,520
She'll meet you
at the restaurant at 5.30.

314
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,160
And there's a gift from Miss Yu.

315
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,600
She was here?

316
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,640
No, she had it sent over.

317
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,040
She says she'll dine alone
since it's your birthday.

318
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,840
Please phone her
when you have a moment.

319
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,320
- I'll get you another coffee.
- Thank you.

320
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,520
Thank you.

321
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,640
That tie looks good on you.

322
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,200
You noticed?
It's much like the old one.

323
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,040
You notice things
if you pay attention.

324
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,800
I'll be off now.

325
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,120
If Chan has a problem,
let me know at the restaurant.

326
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,320
I will.
Why did you change your tie?

327
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,200
The new one was too showy.

328
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,000
I should stick with my own.

329
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,960
Don't forget to lock up.

330
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,240
By the way,
haven't seen your husband lately.

331
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,400
He's abroad now,
on company business.

332
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,680
That's why I see you
at the noodle stall.

333
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,640
I don't like cooking for myself.

334
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,600
Haven't seen your wife
lately either.

335
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,520
Her mother's ill,
she's at home with her.

336
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,760
That explains it.

337
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,720
Good night!

338
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,120
Good night!

339
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,520
Mrs. Chan, I'm glad you're back!

340
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,280
It's raining so hard!

341
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,160
I was going to look for you
with an umbrella.

342
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,600
You're too kind.

343
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,920
Amah, who is it?

344
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,760
- It's Mrs. Chan.
- Mrs. Suen!

345
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,480
Caught in the rain?
I said you could eat with us!

346
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,400
Next time... Enjoy your game.

347
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,240
Her husband's always away.
It's sad to see her so lonely.

348
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,080
She dresses up like that
to go out for noodles?

349
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,960
Mr. Chow!
What are you doing here?

350
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Just calling Mrs. Koo to the phone.

351
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,400
You're late back.

352
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,400
I went to the pictures.

353
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,560
I'll be going.

354
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
Hello?

355
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,960
Yes, please hold on.

356
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,400
- Who is it?
- It's for Mrs. Chan.

357
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,560
It must seem odd to ask you out,
but I want to ask something.

358
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,880
That handbag I saw you with
this evening...

359
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,720
Where did you buy it?

360
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,120
Why do you ask?

361
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,840
It looked so elegant.
I want to get one for my wife.

362
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,960
Mr. Chow, you're so good
to your wife!

363
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,240
Not really! My wife is so fussy.

364
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,880
Her birthday is some days away.
I don't know what to get her.

365
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,560
Could you buy one for me
to give her?

366
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,400
Maybe she wouldn't want one
just exactly the same.

367
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,800
You're right,
I didn't think of that.

368
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,120
A woman would mind.

369
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,040
Yes, especially since
we're neighbors.

370
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,920
Do they come in other colors?

371
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,880
I'd have to ask my husband.

372
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Why?

373
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,800
He bought it for me
on a business trip abroad.

374
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,720
They aren't on sale here.

375
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,040
Then never mind.

376
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,520
Actually...

377
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
I want to ask you something too.

378
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,600
What?

379
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,520
Where did you buy your tie?

380
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,320
I don't know where it came from.

381
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,880
My wife buys all my ties.

382
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,160
Really?

383
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,840
She bought this one
on a business trip abroad.

384
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,880
It's not on sale here.

385
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,840
What a coincidence!

386
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,720
Yes.

387
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,600
Actually...

388
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,520
My husband has one just like it.

389
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,960
He said it was a gift from his boss.

390
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,840
So he wears it every day.

391
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,320
And my wife has a bag
just like yours.

392
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,520
I know,

393
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,840
I've seen it.

394
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,800
What are you getting at, actually?

395
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,680
I thought I was the only one
who knew.

396
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,320
I wonder how it began...

397
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,160
It's late...
won't your wife complain?

398
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,040
She's used to it, she doesn't care.

399
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,080
And your husband?

400
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,400
He must be asleep by now.

401
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,120
Shall we stay out tonight?

402
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,240
My husband would never say that.

403
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,240
What would he say?

404
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,000
Anyhow, he wouldn't say that.

405
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,960
Someone must have made
the first move.

406
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,760
Who else could it be?

407
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,880
It's late...
won't your wife complain?

408
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,080
She's used to it, she doesn't care.

409
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,000
And your husband?

410
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,760
He must be asleep by now.

411
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,080
I can't say it.

412
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,880
I understand.

413
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,400
After all, it's already happened.

414
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,240
It doesn't matter
who made the first move.

415
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,800
Do you really know your wife?

416
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,200
- You order for me.
- Why?

417
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,640
I've no idea what your wife likes.

418
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,520
What about your husband?

419
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,320
Like it hot?

420
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Your wife likes hot dishes.

421
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,920
Why did you call me
at the office today?

422
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,640
I had nothing to do.
I wanted to hear your voice.

423
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,720
You have my husband down pat.
He's a real sweet-talker.

424
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,200
Why didn't you call me today?

425
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,280
I was afraid you won't like it.

426
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,440
Then don't call me again.

427
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,400
Mrs. Chan!
A letter from your husband.

428
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,160
It's not for me,
it's for Mr. Chow next door.

429
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,480
The Japanese stamp made me think
it was your husband.

430
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,880
So I was wrong.

431
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,960
Your wife's in Japan?

432
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,200
How did you know?

433
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,680
What did she say in her letter?

434
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,080
Nothing special.

435
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,280
Anything about
when she'd be back?

436
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,680
No.

437
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,040
What do you think
they're doing right now?

438
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,800
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

439
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,840
Please pull up here!

440
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Why?

441
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,600
I'll get off first.

442
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,880
No, let me.

443
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,680
- Mrs. Chan!
- Ah Ping! You're back?

444
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,520
Visiting Mr. Chow?

445
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,280
Yes, I thought we'd have lunch.
But he isn't well.

446
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,720
- What's wrong with him?
- He's got a fever. He's all alone.

447
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,360
So I'm gonna buy him
something to eat.

448
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,480
The congee downstairs
is quite good.

449
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,200
He doesn't want congee.

450
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,720
What does he want?

451
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,560
Can't taste anything,
so he wants sesame syrup.

452
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,080
Damned troublesome!

453
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,280
Amah!

454
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,160
Mrs. Suen, she's hanging
the washing on the roof.

455
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,800
- Oh, you're back.
- Yes. You've been out?

456
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,320
My mother's birthday is coming up.

457
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,480
So I took her to buy some fabric.

458
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,960
It took all day, I'm half dead!

459
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,280
And I had my hair done...
Is it nice?

460
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
Very nice!

461
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,240
What are you cooking?

462
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,600
I had a sudden craving
for sesame syrup.

463
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,560
That whole pot is for you?

464
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,360
I thought I might as well
make a potfull.

465
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,840
You're so thoughtful!

466
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,200
- Please try it.
- I will.

467
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,440
What a coincidence!

468
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,120
Going out?

469
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,320
I'll buy some noodles, I'm starving.

470
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,880
Hungry? Will you join me?

471
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
No thanks.

472
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,480
Just off work?

473
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,360
You must be very busy.

474
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,680
Actually,
I've been to see a picture.

475
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,160
Really? How was it?

476
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,320
So-so.

477
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,120
I used to like
going to the pictures.

478
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,000
You had many hobbies before.

479
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,280
On your own,
you are free to do lots of things.

480
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,920
Everything changes
when you marry.

481
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,040
It must be decided together...

482
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,160
Right?

483
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,320
I sometimes wonder
what I'd be if I hadn't married.

484
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,440
Have you ever thought of that?

485
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Maybe happier!

486
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,440
I didn't know married life
would be so complicated!

487
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,760
When you're single,

488
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,480
you are only responsible
to yourself.

489
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,640
Once you're married,

490
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,040
doing well on your own
is not enough.

491
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,840
Don't brood on it,
maybe he'll be back soon.

492
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,200
What about you?

493
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,320
Actually, we're in the same boat.

494
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,760
But I don't brood on it.

495
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,400
It's not my fault.

496
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,840
I can't waste time
wondering if I made mistakes.

497
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,800
Life's too short for that.

498
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,680
Something must change.

499
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,760
So what's your plan?

500
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,600
I want to write
a martial-arts serial.

501
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,640
Actually, I've started one.
I'll show it to you.

502
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,960
Great!

503
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,680
You like them too,
so why not help me write it?

504
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,240
I wouldn't know how,
I only read them!

505
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,640
We could discuss it together.

506
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,600
Alright, I'll try my best.

507
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,080
I never thanked you
for the sesame syrup.

508
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,560
There's no need,
I was making it anyway.

509
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,440
Amazing! I was craving
for some sesame syrup that day.

510
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
Really? What a coincidence!

511
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,720
It really was!

512
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,400
I'll go for those noodles.

513
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,200
Again! Halfway through dinner,
he's drunk! Disgusting!

514
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,360
I told you to stop!
What can you do?

515
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,800
It's me!

516
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,360
You scared me.

517
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,120
How's Mr. Koo?

518
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,040
Drunk, as usual.

519
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,960
I didn't expect them back so early!

520
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,960
Since you're trapped here,
finish the noodles.

521
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,080
They'll probably go soon.

522
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,240
Want some soup?

523
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,840
Want some soup?

524
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,200
Mrs. Suen! Playing here tonight!

525
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,760
Yes, Mrs. Koo is dealing
with her husband.

526
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,480
I could do that.

527
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,840
No, we should not trouble you.

528
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,160
Think you'll play all night?

529
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,960
No, we'll just play eight rounds.

530
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,080
They'll play till morning?

531
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,280
Mrs. Suen says only eight rounds.

532
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,040
You believe that?

533
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,360
You get some rest,
I'll wake you when they leave.

534
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,080
And you?

535
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,480
I have a chapter to finish.

536
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,880
Where have you got to?

537
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,960
The drunken master just showed up.

538
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,040
When did he get written in?

539
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,240
Just now!

540
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,640
Mr. Chow, home so early?

541
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,480
- I went out to buy some food.
- No work today?

542
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,400
I don't feel so good,
I'm staying home.

543
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,720
A sick man shouldn't eat
all that sticky rice.

544
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,520
Some of it is for later.

545
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,440
Don't stuff yourself!

546
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,800
Good morning!

547
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,440
Good morning,
finished your game?

548
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,800
No yet, but Mr. Yang has to work.
Mr. Tsai is coming to replace him.

549
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,360
Did you call the office for me?

550
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,720
Yes.

551
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,560
What did you tell them?

552
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,960
That you weren't feeling well.

553
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,400
Did they ask who you were?

554
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,640
No.

555
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,920
Probably took me for your husband.

556
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,120
Mr. Ho knows that he's away.

557
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,160
Pretend he's come back.

558
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,720
Maybe we're being too cautious?

559
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,600
I'm always round anyway.

560
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,760
We shouldn't have panicked.

561
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,240
Well, they did turn up
without warning.

562
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,200
What would they assume?

563
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,160
One can't put a foot wrong.

564
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,280
You can go!

565
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,360
- Amah!
- Mrs. Chan! You're back very late!

566
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,880
I had a lot of work today.

567
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,600
I didn't see you leave this morning.

568
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,640
I had breakfast with my mother.

569
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,000
You weren't here when I left.

570
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,040
Where's Mrs. Suen?

571
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,800
Asleep,
she played mahjong all day.

572
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,160
- Be quiet, don't wake her.
- Alright!

573
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,400
Mrs. Chan, is your leg alright?

574
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,560
It's these new shoes.

575
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,120
Why a special dinner tonight?

576
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,440
Since you won't take
your share of the writing fee...

577
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,440
All I did
was give you some thoughts.

578
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,840
Someone else
is asking for a serial too.

579
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,720
There'll be more work soon.

580
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,680
Really? So quickly?
Isn't the workload too much?

581
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,480
That's why
I'm looking for a new place.

582
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,880
What for?

583
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,680
To write in!

584
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,680
It'll be more convenient.

585
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,000
There's nothing between us,
but I don't want gossip.

586
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,480
What do you think?

587
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,360
Why waste money?

588
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:16,080
You don't need me,
you can write on your own.

589
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,960
Who do you want?

590
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,760
Chow Mo-Wan?

591
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,320
He hasn't been in for several days.

592
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,800
We're looking for him too.

593
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,880
May I know who's calling?

594
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,960
Any message?

595
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,880
It's no trouble, goodbye.

596
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,680
Please get this to Accounts.

597
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,400
And have the air-conditioner
serviced tomorrow.

598
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,560
Mr. Ho!

599
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,160
No need to stay
if everything's done.

600
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,040
- I'll lock up.
- Yes.

601
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,640
Hello?

602
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,440
Where are you?

603
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,240
I'll come again tomorrow.

604
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,560
No need,
I'll be alright after some rest.

605
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,960
It's no trouble.

606
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,240
I'll bring you some food...
What would you like?

607
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,800
Whatever.

608
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,120
Then I'll leave now. Get some rest.

609
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,120
Call me when you get home.

610
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,360
Let it ring three times,
then hang up.

611
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:22,960
Alright.

612
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,680
I didn't think you'd come.

613
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,280
We won't be like them.

614
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,120
See you tomorrow.

615
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,600
Tell me honestly...

616
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,080
Do you have a mistress?

617
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,280
You're crazy!

618
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,560
Who told you I had?

619
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,400
Never mind who.

620
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,920
Do you or don't you?

621
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,520
No.

622
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,440
Don't lie!

623
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,440
Look at me...

624
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,720
I'm asking you,
do you have a mistress?

625
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,840
Yes!

626
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,440
That's no reaction!

627
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,480
If he admits it outright,
let him have it!

628
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,840
I wasn't expecting
he would admit it so easily.

629
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,000
I didn't know how to react!

630
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,320
One more time, alright?

631
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,240
Tell me frankly...

632
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,120
Do you have a mistress?

633
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,080
You're crazy!

634
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,000
Who told you that?

635
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,600
Never mind that,
do you or don't you?

636
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,920
No.

637
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,040
Don't lie!

638
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,160
Tell me!

639
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,480
Look at me,

640
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,600
do you have a mistress?

641
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,640
Yes!

642
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,880
Are you alright?

643
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,520
I didn't expect it to hurt so much.

644
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,000
This is just a rehearsal.

645
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,320
He won't really admit it so readily.

646
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,080
It's alright, don't take it so hard.

647
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,560
You've been out a lot lately.

648
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,800
Yes.

649
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,560
It's right to enjoy yourself
while you're young.

650
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,320
But don't overdo it.

651
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,120
When will your husband be back?

652
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,120
Soon!

653
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,320
In future,
don't let him travel so much.

654
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,320
A couple should spend time
together.

655
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,880
Don't you agree?

656
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,960
Good night.

657
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,840
Will you come over tonight?

658
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,120
What for?

659
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,880
The editor's hounding me,
he says I'm too slow.

660
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,440
I need your help,
when can you come?

661
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,400
Not anytime soon.

662
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,320
Why not?

663
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,920
Mrs. Suen lectured me last night.

664
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,520
What did she say?

665
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,360
Rather not say.

666
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,400
We shouldn't see so much
of each other.

667
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,440
Mrs. Chan,
going out for noodles again?

668
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:39,320
Not tonight,
I'll make myself something.

669
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,720
Join us,
we're having vegetable won-tons!

670
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,560
Alright.

671
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,160
- No lunch today, Mr. Ho?
- No.

672
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,760
A Mr. Chow just called for you.

673
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,080
He wants you to call him back.

674
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,720
Thank you.

675
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,480
- Back from work?
- Yes.

676
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,800
- Strange weather!
- Isn't it?

677
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,960
Been here long?

678
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,720
Just a while.

679
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,720
I don't think it'll stop soon.

680
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,520
Wait for me.

681
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,720
I'll see you home.

682
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,400
We'd better not be seen together.

683
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,800
Then you go first.

684
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,520
If they see your umbrella,

685
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,920
they'll know I was with you.

686
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,840
I wasn't thinking.

687
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,240
You go first, I'll wait a while.

688
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,920
I'll keep you company.

689
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,640
Did you try to call me?

690
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,960
I wasn't sure you got the message.

691
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,880
Could you get me a boat ticket?

692
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,520
To where?

693
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,960
Ah Ping wrote from Singapore.

694
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,680
They're short of staff,
he'd like me to go and help.

695
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,400
How long will you stay?

696
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,240
Don't know, I'll play it by ear.

697
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,840
Why rush off to Singapore?

698
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,320
A change of scene...

699
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,240
I've had enough of the gossip.

700
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,160
We know it's not true,
so why worry?

701
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:24,760
I used to think that too,
and it didn't worry me.

702
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,520
I thought we wouldn't be like them.

703
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,000
But I was wrong.

704
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,720
You won't leave your husband.

705
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,000
So I'd rather go away.

706
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,480
I didn't think
you'd fall in love with me.

707
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,920
I didn't either.

708
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,400
I was only curious
to know how it started.

709
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,760
Now I know.

710
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,800
Feelings can creep up
just like that.

711
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,280
I thought I was in control.

712
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,880
But I hate to think
of your husband coming home.

713
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:21,960
I wish he'd stay away!

714
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,120
I'm so bad!

715
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,600
Will you do me one favor?

716
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,760
What?

717
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,960
I want to be prepared...

718
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,600
You'd better not see me again.

719
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,600
Is your husband back?

720
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,920
Yes...

721
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,320
Am I hopeless?

722
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,880
Not really.

723
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,560
I won't see you again.

724
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,040
Keep a closer eye on your husband.

725
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,400
Please...

726
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,000
Don't be serious,
it's only a rehearsal.

727
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,360
Don't cry!

728
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,280
This isn't real...

729
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,800
I don't want to go home tonight.

730
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,200
Mei-Yi wants to dedicate a song
to her honeymooning friends.

731
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:21,000
And Mrs. Cheung wishes the best
to her neighbors.

732
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,000
And Mr. Chan,
now in business in Japan,

733
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:29,640
wants to wish his wife
a happy birthday.

734
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,800
So let's all enjoy Zhou Xuan
singing in "Full Bloom".

735
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,760
It's me.

736
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,920
If there's an extra ticket...

737
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,400
would you go with me?

738
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,280
It's me.

739
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,160
If there's an extra ticket...

740
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,360
would you go with me?

741
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,760
SINGAPORE, 1963

742
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,480
Mr. Chow has gone to work.

743
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,040
Any message?

744
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,960
You're welcome!

745
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,160
Has anyone been in my room?

746
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,240
No.

747
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,080
- Something's missing.
- What?

748
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,280
In the old days,

749
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:21,800
if someone had a secret
they didn't want to share...

750
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,040
You know what they did?

751
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,640
Have no idea.

752
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,440
They went up a mountain,
found a tree...

753
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,480
Carved a hole in it...

754
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,560
And whispered the secret
into the hole.

755
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,320
Then they covered it with mud.

756
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,960
And leave the secret there forever.

757
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:53,040
What a pain!
I'd just go to get laid.

758
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,880
Not everyone's like you!

759
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:03,040
I'm just an average guy,
I don't have secrets like you.

760
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,960
You bottle things up!

761
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,920
Tell me something!

762
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,080
I don't have secrets.

763
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,680
Come off it, buddy!

764
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,360
I won't tell anyone.

765
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,920
Hello, Singapore Daily.

766
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,840
Hold on.

767
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,560
Mr. Chow, call for you.

768
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,320
Thanks!

769
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,120
Hello?

770
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,640
Hello?

771
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,520
HONG KONG, 1966

772
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,040
- Who is it?
- It's me.

773
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,560
- Mrs. Chan, long time no see!
- Yes.

774
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,080
- Amah, who's there?
- Mrs. Suen!

775
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,160
What brings you here?

776
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,080
It's been a while.

777
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,840
I was nearby so I thought
I'd bring your boat ticket.

778
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,240
And a small gift.

779
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,320
You shouldn't have,
it's nice just to see you.

780
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,400
The place is in such a mess!

781
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,720
Already started packing?

782
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:13,920
It's hopeless,
I can't bear to throw things away!

783
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,360
Let's find you a seat.

784
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,240
- Have some tea!
- Thank you!

785
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,720
Eat with us, Mrs. Chan!
I'm going to the market.

786
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,360
I can't, I have work waiting.

787
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,840
Don't rush off!

788
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:39,640
Mrs. Suen will be upset
if you don't eat here.

789
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,280
Amah, pour me some tea too.

790
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,240
How's your husband?

791
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,120
He's fine, thank you.

792
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:49,000
How long will you be away?

793
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,760
I don't know.

794
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,440
If I like it, I might stay!

795
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,320
Why?

796
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:01,040
My daughter worries
about the situation in Hong Kong.

797
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,840
I don't want to leave.

798
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:09,840
Since the Koos left, I don't have
my mahjong partners anymore.

799
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:15,680
And my daughter needs help
with her kids in the US.

800
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,640
What about this place?

801
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,520
I'm not sure...

802
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,040
I don't want to sell it.

803
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,720
So I might rent it out.

804
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,440
How much would you want?

805
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,320
You're interested?

806
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,800
You could have it at a discount.

807
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,560
I'll think about it.

808
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,200
Mrs. Suen, your tea!

809
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,880
Who lives next door now?

810
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:54,360
I don't really know them.

811
01:22:54,800 --> 01:23:00,600
The Koos were almost like family!

812
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,840
It was so nice then, wasn't it?

813
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,920
Yes.

814
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,600
Let's sit over here.

815
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:35,960
Yes?

816
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,240
Is Mr. Koo in?

817
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:39,960
He moved long ago.

818
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,400
Do you know where he is?

819
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,000
You know him well?

820
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,160
I used to live here.

821
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,160
Is Mrs. Suen still next door?

822
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:55,200
She's gone! It's too chaotic,
everyone's running away.

823
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,840
So who lives there now?

824
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,160
A woman and her son.

825
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,520
The kid is cute.

826
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:11,680
No address in the Philippines...
Just his son's phone number.

827
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,440
- I can't accept this!
- Please, you must.

828
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,680
Thank you, then.

829
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,080
That era has passed.

830
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,920
Nothing that belonged to it
exists any more.

831
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,120
Are you ready?

832
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,320
- Okay!
- Let's go!

833
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,320
CAMBODIA, 1966

834
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,200
The presidential corps waits
at Pochentong Airport...

835
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:04,720
Prince Norodom Sihanouk
and Queen Sisowath Kossamak

836
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,000
come forward
to greet General De Gaulle.

837
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:18,560
It's ten kilometers
from Pochentong to Phnom Penh.

838
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,080
200,000 people line the route.

839
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,480
A welcome unprecedented
in the history of the kingdom.

840
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:54,200
He remembers those vanished years.

841
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,040
As though looking through
a dusty window pane,

842
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:02,200
the past is something he could see,
but not touch.

843
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:06,720
And everything he sees
is blurred and indistinct.

844
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,680
End

845
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,400
