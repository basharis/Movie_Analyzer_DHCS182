1
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:57,286
We give the whip to wild animals
when they try to rebel.

2
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:02,041
This way you'll learn
not to try to escape again.

3
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:07,212
Take this.

4
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,574
You know what this cross means don't you?
Mexican's bitch!

5
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:02,244
Let fire clean away your sins!

6
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:30,105
And you from what cemetery
have you come from?

7
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:32,816
If you came here to bury these bastards...

8
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:34,526
hurry up, and get it done
without a word.

9
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,487
Instead, I like to talk.

10
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:41,158
From the way you're talking,
it seems you're in a hurry...

11
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:44,161
to end up in the coffin
you've got behind you.

12
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,704
Maybe.

13
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,415
Are you from the North?

14
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,959
I fought for the North.

15
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:54,671
We don't like those who fought for the North.
This is the South.

16
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,050
I see it, brother. I see it.

17
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,470
Enough! Who cares about this gravedigger.

18
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,138
Let's take care of the woman now.

19
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,641
It's not nice to take it out on women.

20
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:07,517
What did you say?

21
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,187
It doesn't matter.

22
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,065
What matters is that you're about to die.

23
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,672
My name is Django.

24
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,008
As long as you stay with me,
nobody will harm you.

25
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:55,315
You wouldn't make it very far.

26
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,235
Besides, it's not yet time
to cross that bridge.

27
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:04,032
For now, my path goes in the opposite direction.

28
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,869
What's your name?

29
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,039
- Maria.
- Let's go.

30
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,147
A bed for the girl.

31
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:27,861
Anything for you, stranger.
But the girl...

32
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,616
No, she can't stay here.

33
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:36,411
And there are no more rooms We're full.

34
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:38,371
Go and see.

35
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:50,967
The key to your room.
Give it to me, come on.

36
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,604
Don't worry. 
I'll pay for the inconvenience.

37
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,524
I think that's enough.

38
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,484
Oh, well, thank you!
Look at this!

39
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,995
Go to sleep.
You've had quite an eventful day.

40
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,541
The room is upstairs, at the end.

41
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:46,273
Tomorrow morning the girl has to leave.

42
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:50,110
No later than tomorrow, I'm sorry.
Understood?

43
00:12:52,113 --> 00:12:55,156
There's no need to hurry,
my friend.

44
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,913
Bring me something to eat.

45
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:10,357
Here.

46
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:18,740
If you work in the coffin business,
you chose well.

47
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:21,201
There is plenty of work here.

48
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:23,828
So far, I've met only a few customers.

49
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,873
When the damn war started between...

50
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,627
the Mexicans and Major Jackson's soldiers...

51
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:35,840
they moved everybody out
reducing the town to this.

52
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:37,384
A dead town.

53
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:41,805
And your women sleep with the ghosts?

54
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:44,307
We manage...

55
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:48,478
A bit with the Mexicans,
and a bit with the Major's men.

56
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:51,439
We want to be at peace with everybody.

57
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,400
Without being unfair.

58
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:57,028
Well, we have an agreement...
This is a neutral place...

59
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,574
We try very hard to stay alive.

60
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:05,662
You are new to this place, young man...

61
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:09,332
You don't know Major Jackson...

62
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:14,212
You don't know him, do you?

63
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:20,969
Stop trying to figure out
who I know, old man.

64
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:43,116
Don't you want to offer me a drink?

65
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,329
You know, it takes guts
to travel with that girl.

66
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:51,875
It means having to face
both the racists and the Mexicans.

67
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,335
I like having to face people.

68
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:57,130
Oh, really? Well, so much the better.

69
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:03,344
You know, my colleagues
are afraid of the coffin.

70
00:16:04,054 --> 00:16:08,391
It doesn't scare me.
It's just like any other job.

71
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:12,187
Is someone in there?

72
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,988
Someone called Django.

73
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,832
Good day, brother Jonathan.

74
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:52,310
This is all I was able to put together.

75
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,561
For this month's share...

76
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:55,480
business isn't going well.

77
00:16:55,856 --> 00:17:00,235
In that case it'll be better
if you talk about this to the Major.

78
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:01,504
I'm getting a dress to change into.

79
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:05,258
You know, the Major's men
should be here soon.

80
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:06,968
Maybe he'll come here himself.

81
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:09,762
The Major doesn't like green.

82
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:12,432
He's crazy about red.

83
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:18,438
Here.

84
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,110
I'll change here.
I'm used to my mirror.

85
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,864
Don't be upset.
Maybe you can save yourself...

86
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:29,699
if you are nice to the Major.

87
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:33,536
Why don't you dress yourself in red? Go on.

88
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,039
Dress in red, and you'll be safe.

89
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:41,169
The Major isn't after you.
It's the Mexicans he can't stand.

90
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:44,631
He says it's their skin color
that bothers him.

91
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,384
Well, you're really asking for it.
You could have stayed with us.

92
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:50,803
But you had to run away and ended up...

93
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,473
right in the hands of Jackson's
worst enemies, the Mexicans.

94
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:58,019
Why did you run away from them as well?
But, what is it you want?

95
00:18:58,187 --> 00:18:59,228
I don't know.

96
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:04,150
What do you mean, you don't know?
Listen, are you kidding me?

97
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,945
Of course, they'll get rid of your man.

98
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:10,323
What a pity, he's such a good-looking guy.

99
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:13,785
A pack of cards, please.

100
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,375
He wants a pack of cards.

101
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,347
You like to play with the
deadly Ace of Spade, uh?

102
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:38,267
Listen to me,
and you'll manage to save yourself.

103
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:40,770
Make yourself as pretty as you can,
it won't be hard.

104
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,231
Thanks, but it's pointless.

105
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:47,151
Damn!

106
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:51,114
That's Jackson having fun.

107
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:56,828
Some Mexican must have refused to pay...
and so, they make him run...

108
00:19:58,706 --> 00:19:59,914
Terrible!

109
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:17,807
Go on!

110
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,624
Another one.

111
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,060
I'm bored now. You take care of it.

112
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,091
An interesting new arrival in town.

113
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:23,933
They'll be coming here now,
and they'll want to have fun.

114
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:28,437
Come. Lock yourself in,
and don't move.

115
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,380
Major Jackson and his men are coming!

116
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,224
Good day, Major Jackson.

117
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:28,623
Welcome! Make yourselves at home.

118
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,957
Come...

119
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:35,630
Unfortunately, it's not all of it,
but, as soon as I am able to...

120
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:40,092
I believe you, Nathaniel.
I believe you.

121
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:43,221
Cowards never lies I know that well..

122
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,973
especially when they're paying
for their protection.

123
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:52,939
You'll pay me your share
at the fort in a week.

124
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,360
In a week? As you wish.
Thank you, Major, thank you.

125
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:21,092
Hey, you, come upstairs with me.

126
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,427
- I don't want to.
- Come on, let's go.

127
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:25,471
I don't want to, it's not
as if you'd bought me.

128
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,850
If you don't want to go with him,
you come with me.

129
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:32,728
She told you she doesn't feel like it.

130
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,440
Let her go.

131
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:39,860
Stop it!

132
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:42,863
Send away all the girls, Nathaniel.

133
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:46,701
Let's go girls, go upstairs.
You, too.

134
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:50,955
That's lucky.

135
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,543
One must be very brave
to talk this way to Ringo.

136
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:59,005
Brave, or crazy.

137
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:04,093
Just like the dirty Northerner,
who killed five of my men down by the river.

138
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,806
That must have been some smart guy.

139
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:14,312
Five men in one go?
That's specialist' work.

140
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,982
The man also took a woman with him.

141
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:21,569
A whore who was sold to the Mexicans.

142
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:25,781
One who betrayed our race.

143
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,788
The war is over,
and these things are outdated now.

144
00:25:34,124 --> 00:25:39,211
I am sorry to contradict you,
but my war never ends, my friend.

145
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:42,381
That's clever to bring a coffin with you.

146
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:46,844
You'll get a special favour treatment,
you'll be... buried.

147
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:51,265
Usually we feed Northern bastards to vultures,
to poison them.

148
00:25:51,892 --> 00:25:56,604
I didn't know this racial matter
also involved those poor vultures.

149
00:25:57,189 --> 00:26:00,483
I thought it only concerned Southern pigs.

150
00:26:01,985 --> 00:26:04,070
We can proceed, men.

151
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:07,740
We've talked for the day.

152
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:28,219
I've got one more shot left.

153
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:32,515
But, that would be too easy.

154
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:37,812
How many more men do you have...

155
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:39,271
pig?

156
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:44,485
I asked, how many more men?

157
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:47,988
Forty.

158
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:54,453
Good, pig.
Bring all forty of them with you next time.

159
00:26:55,956 --> 00:26:57,873
It will be more fun.

160
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,003
I'll still be here waiting for you.

161
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:08,092
Rest assured. We'll come.

162
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,073
You can put things back in order.
But don't use my coffin.

163
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:09,445
I am taking a blanket.

164
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,698
Thank you.

165
00:28:14,451 --> 00:28:15,534
For what?

166
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:18,162
For what you have done for me.

167
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:26,170
I didn't do it for you.

168
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:29,924
Well, then, thank you
even if you didn't do it for me.

169
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:33,219
You thank too much.
Who knows if was right to save you?

170
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:36,680
I thank you because,
even if it was just for a few moments...

171
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,683
you gave me the feeling
of having a man at my side...

172
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,727
who could protect me...

173
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:45,606
who could love me.

174
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:04,291
Then we must make sure
that the illusion is complete.

175
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:09,630
Brief, but complete.

176
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,284
Why did you let Major Jackson go?

177
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:25,456
He'll return with his 40 thugs
and he will kill us all.

178
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:27,791
I know him too well. Unfortunately.

179
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:33,797
What are you afraid of, old man?
You pay to be protected by him.

180
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:38,344
I pay so that I won't be killed
like those he calls inferior...

181
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,055
because their skin's a bit darker.

182
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:44,975
The sun, also, darkens the skin.

183
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,729
Yes, but Jackson and his men
don't want to admit that.

184
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,439
They have some sort of religion.

185
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,610
Did you see the red hoods they wear?
They're fanatics! Crazy!

186
00:30:56,946 --> 00:30:59,448
Sometimes, it's necessary to eliminate
the fanatics, the madmen...

187
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:00,908
for the good of everyone.

188
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:03,577
I know, but you can't do it alone.

189
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:06,914
I am not alone.

190
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:17,174
Leave. Take the girl with you
and go far away.

191
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:23,806
You worry too much, old man.
It could ruin your health.

192
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:27,976
Quickly, before Jackson arrives.

193
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:34,191
Go! You could try to get to the swamp
and escape to the other side of it.

194
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:41,323
It's better if you go back inside.
There's no change to my plan.

195
00:31:48,498 --> 00:31:51,583
If he finds you here, he'll blame us, too!
He'll kill us.

196
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:55,379
There is nothing to be afraid of, old man.
I told you...

197
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:58,257
I am not alone.

198
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:35,461
If you could go to the Mexicans,
maybe those two would be saved.

199
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:40,758
Great, but I wouldn't make it alive,
not even to the cemetery.

200
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:50,225
With all those hooded men gathering,
I have to be honest...

201
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:55,481
I am sorry, but I am forced to hope
they'll kill him right away.

202
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:59,067
He'll suffer less,
and I will lose less customers.

203
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,897
Mother of God!

204
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:29,254
It's over, old man.
You won't have to pay anymore to stay alive.

205
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,506
Did you kill them all?

206
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:35,594
Almost all of them.

207
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,265
Don't worry. You'll still have
the Mexicans as customers.

208
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:42,768
Get rid of those dead guys now.

209
00:37:44,437 --> 00:37:49,483
And where will I put them?
We'll have to open another cemetery.

210
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,986
Cemeteries are a good investment here...

211
00:37:53,112 --> 00:37:55,322
if you can get paid in advance.

212
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,950
And Major Jackson? Is he dead as well?

213
00:38:00,453 --> 00:38:02,204
No, I let him go.

214
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,413
Why?

215
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:08,960
Because it wasn't his time yet.
I need him alive for now.

216
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,234
If they had told me that
I would end up as a gravedigger...

217
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,319
and without pay.

218
00:38:34,737 --> 00:38:36,947
Well, anyway... better above than under.

219
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:46,039
Someone you knew?

220
00:38:46,415 --> 00:38:48,542
A part of my life.

221
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:52,379
Probably the only one that really mattered.

222
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:56,716
Did Jackson's men kill her?

223
00:38:59,428 --> 00:39:00,679
They killed her.

224
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:06,017
And where were you when it happened?

225
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:07,227
Far away...

226
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:11,606
too far away, old man.

227
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,127
This damn woman is the incarnation of sin.

228
00:39:32,628 --> 00:39:35,839
It's her who made blood rain on the town.

229
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:39,301
Yes, that's true.
Because of you we'll have to leave.

230
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:42,596
Men won't come to this town anymore.
We'll starve to death!

231
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,807
Don't be silly!
Maria is not to blame for what happened.

232
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:49,311
No, it's the truth!
Smash her, destroy her...

233
00:39:49,478 --> 00:39:52,480
if you don't want that creep
to hurt you again.

234
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,192
Leave her alone!
What has she done to you?

235
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,485
Why are you tormenting her?

236
00:39:57,653 --> 00:40:00,280
Screw off, you bitch!
We don't want you.

237
00:40:01,324 --> 00:40:02,699
Go away from here!

238
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:06,745
Don't be stupid!
It's her who's responsible!

239
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:21,801
I'll show you!

240
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,491
The Mexicans are coming!

241
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:23,840
You wanted to run, uh?
But, you didn't make it in time?

242
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,593
You are Jackson's damn spy!

243
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:31,139
You tell them what you see
and what you hear...

244
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,644
because you have big ears.

245
00:42:38,314 --> 00:42:41,983
And we know what to do with big ears.

246
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:44,611
Right, <i>muchachos?</i>

247
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,284
No, no!

248
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:04,881
Move!

249
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:12,430
Hey, Yankee!

250
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:38,623
I thought there were no more bastards
left in town.

251
00:43:47,049 --> 00:43:48,425
Are you Hugo's men?

252
00:43:49,802 --> 00:43:51,010
Wait!

253
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:58,518
It's better to take him to the General.
He might want him alive.

254
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:06,776
Escaping from us was a
dangerous thing to do, Maria.

255
00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:09,195
I could punish you harshly
for what you did.

256
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:11,948
What would you say if I cut off
one of your beautiful ears?

257
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:16,077
You had no right to keep me prisoner!

258
00:44:16,162 --> 00:44:19,622
I had the right that every man has
with all the women he likes!

259
00:44:19,832 --> 00:44:24,711
You know, Hugo, you're talking 
just like one of Jackson's racists.

260
00:44:25,588 --> 00:44:27,005
Bitch!

261
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,759
Careful Maria.
I don't allow this from anyone.

262
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:34,971
Don't forget that you are
half Yankee and half Mexican.

263
00:44:35,097 --> 00:44:37,849
Don't let me remember
the one half I hate.

264
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,858
Look who's here.

265
00:44:47,443 --> 00:44:50,528
The most clever <i>Gringo</i>
of the entire frontier.

266
00:44:52,781 --> 00:44:57,076
<i>Hombre!</i> It has been so long
since I last saw your dirty face!

267
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,745
This is Django.

268
00:44:58,954 --> 00:45:02,665
A deserter, thief, and to me,
more than a friend!

269
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,083
A brother.

270
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:10,381
Now we are even.

271
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:11,758
Calm down, Ricardo!

272
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:15,136
I owe Django a lot!

273
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:19,140
Only your life which I saved once in prison.
And now your woman.

274
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:20,808
I brought her back to you, Hugo.

275
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,770
She is in good condition.
Take her back.

276
00:45:28,275 --> 00:45:31,110
She is not my woman.
She is just one woman.

277
00:45:32,905 --> 00:45:36,282
I'm thirsty.
We have to celebrate our meeting!

278
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,620
To your health, Django!

279
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,331
To the death of Jackson's pigs!

280
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:46,501
Long live the revolution!
Death to Jackson!

281
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:51,047
Those pigs aren't here anymore.
He killed them all.

282
00:45:57,346 --> 00:46:00,723
You were able to kill
all those bastards by yourself?

283
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:03,977
That's impossible!
How did you do that, Django?

284
00:46:05,437 --> 00:46:07,397
It wasn't very difficult.

285
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,400
If you had been in my place,
you would have done it too.

286
00:46:12,111 --> 00:46:13,903
Of course.

287
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:18,992
But my men are tired.
They'd all like to go home.

288
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:23,746
Me too, but in Mexico,
the government men are waiting for us.

289
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:29,961
And we don't have enough weapons
to fight against them.

290
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,379
Of course.

291
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:35,425
But I could help you, Hugo.

292
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:40,221
And how?

293
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,465
Lord!

294
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:20,928
This toy is worth 150 guns in one go.

295
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:24,891
It's with this that I exterminated
the Major's men.

296
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,684
What type of weapon is this?

297
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:29,395
Get out of the way, men.
You could get hurt.

298
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:33,399
No! Don't do it, Django!
I beg you!

299
00:47:50,918 --> 00:47:53,169
These are the kind of weapons
I would need!

300
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:58,341
With ten of these it would be easy
to go back to Mexico. Right, Hugo?

301
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:00,426
Where are the other nine?

302
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,554
They are in <i>Pecos</i> waiting to be bought.

303
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:05,473
I know the man who sells them.

304
00:48:07,893 --> 00:48:13,648
Thank you for the information, Django.
But our's is a poor revolution.

305
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:19,153
If you are poor,
you have to try to become rich.

306
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:21,280
That's the only way you can win.

307
00:48:21,407 --> 00:48:23,533
Did you come here to pull my leg?

308
00:48:23,826 --> 00:48:27,537
No, I came here to help you
and to get help.

309
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:31,958
Well, explain yourself!

310
00:48:33,669 --> 00:48:36,462
At the fort there is gold
for you and for me.

311
00:48:40,342 --> 00:48:43,803
The fort is very far from the border.

312
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:47,557
I can't return to Mexico...

313
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:54,230
at least not until I have
the 10 machine guns.

314
00:48:55,315 --> 00:49:00,153
Plus, those government dogs
are many more than us.

315
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:04,866
The men of the fort every Saturday
receive a visit from Nathaniel...

316
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:08,953
who brings his...
wagonload of women over the border.

317
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:10,788
Isn't that right, old man?

318
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,582
Uh, yeah.

319
00:49:17,296 --> 00:49:19,756
Explain yourself better, Django.

320
00:49:20,674 --> 00:49:25,553
This week Jackson will also go to the fort
to stash his gold safely in Mexico.

321
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,140
That's why I kept him alive.

322
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:32,643
I want that gold even more
than his death.

323
00:49:34,062 --> 00:49:35,938
And that gold will be ours!
Understood?

324
00:49:37,566 --> 00:49:38,941
Understood!

325
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,652
But how?

326
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:47,200
It will be difficult, that's for sure.

327
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:50,161
But with the help of my toy
it will also be fun.

328
00:50:03,175 --> 00:50:06,052
The women have arrived!

329
00:50:06,553 --> 00:50:09,639
Finally, they have arrived!
It's about time!

330
00:50:11,058 --> 00:50:13,100
The women are here!

331
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:16,229
Hurray, the women!

332
00:51:09,575 --> 00:51:11,659
Over here!

333
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:15,746
Pigs!

334
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:19,292
Cowards!

335
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,907
Let's go!

336
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:52,760
Come on! Get the horses!

337
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,146
Move it, Ricardo!

338
00:53:41,768 --> 00:53:43,477
Go!

339
00:53:48,275 --> 00:53:50,943
The machine gun is stuck!

340
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:12,548
Go on!

341
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,933
If we get across the border,
we'll be safe!

342
00:54:23,018 --> 00:54:25,311
Let's go then!

343
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,257
Come on. Why don't you carry on?

344
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,927
We have to stop.
Otherwise, we'll enter American territory.

345
00:55:40,887 --> 00:55:44,390
Hurray! General Hugo has arrived!

346
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:07,288
Men! We are back!
It was a fantastic trip!

347
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,336
Django's action was a complete success!

348
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,882
- With the gold we'll buy the weapons!
- Hurray!

349
00:56:18,049 --> 00:56:19,717
We'll go back to Mexico.

350
00:56:19,885 --> 00:56:21,719
We'll win the revolution!

351
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:23,637
Hurray the revolution!

352
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,559
You see Hugo, we made it.

353
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,768
Oh, yes!

354
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:35,107
All that's left is to divide the gold
and say goodbye.

355
00:56:35,483 --> 00:56:37,276
Give me my share.

356
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:43,032
Just like that?
Do you really want to leave just now?

357
00:56:46,578 --> 00:56:50,956
Well, I have nothing more to do
in this town.

358
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:54,627
What do you mean, 'nothing more', brother?

359
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,671
Together we'll do great things!

360
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,925
I'll make you lieutenant of my revolution!

361
00:57:01,343 --> 00:57:07,473
You already have many lieutenants,
and I only want what I'm owed. Please.

362
00:57:09,684 --> 00:57:11,810
Are you kidding?

363
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:15,940
You'll get double, double, you understand?

364
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,234
Once I am in power.

365
00:57:25,033 --> 00:57:26,033
Hugo...

366
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,786
I want my gold.

367
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:35,834
Oh... Brother, you're obsessed.
Nobody will take your gold.

368
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:37,836
Don't you trust me?

369
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:41,173
He doesn't trust me.

370
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:50,724
You know, we'll keep your gold
in a safe place.

371
00:57:51,393 --> 00:57:53,811
Let me show you where. Come.

372
00:58:04,322 --> 00:58:08,993
There we are.
There is only one door and many guards.

373
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:14,081
The gold for our revolution
will be well guarded.

374
00:58:37,731 --> 00:58:40,899
No one will be able to take it away.

375
00:58:41,067 --> 00:58:45,279
It's a pile of gold,
but in powder.

376
00:59:10,972 --> 00:59:12,306
Take this. Drink.

377
00:59:12,307 --> 00:59:13,432
No.

378
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:15,559
What's the matter, bitch?

379
00:59:15,727 --> 00:59:18,687
Are you in a bad mood because
the American doesn't care about you?

380
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,606
Come, I'll comfort you!

381
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,150
Damn you!

382
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:24,485
Ricardo!

383
00:59:25,987 --> 00:59:27,613
Leave Maria alone.

384
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:32,201
And you would give her to that bastard American!
It's better if I take her!

385
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,411
I decide who will take her!

386
00:59:58,561 --> 00:59:59,645
You bastard!

387
01:01:42,749 --> 01:01:47,836
Thank you, Django.
You saved my life once more. I won't forget it.

388
01:01:50,298 --> 01:01:52,925
Look at Maria. Look at her.

389
01:01:54,886 --> 01:01:57,137
She can't take her eyes off you.

390
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:59,431
Take her! My gift to you.

391
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:02,142
You'll spend a wonderful night.

392
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,063
Thanks. But she's not my type.

393
01:02:14,572 --> 01:02:16,114
I prefer this one.

394
01:02:18,076 --> 01:02:21,745
You see, Maria?
The <i>Gringo</i> prefers the dark one!

395
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:30,254
Don't be hurt. Come and drink with us!
Tonight is a great night!

396
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:34,841
Come on, <i>muchachos!</i>
<i>Tequila</i> for everyone!

397
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:51,733
Get undressed.

398
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:05,998
Carry on undressing.

399
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,752
Don't pay attention to what I'm doing.

400
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:25,035
Look!

401
01:04:31,042 --> 01:04:32,918
- My goodness!
- Look.

402
01:04:49,143 --> 01:04:50,435
Look!

403
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:56,900
Beautiful, uh?

404
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,069
Just a minute!

405
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:48,710
The horses are fleeing!
Quick let's catch them.

406
01:11:22,453 --> 01:11:24,370
You have to take me with you, Django!

407
01:11:26,624 --> 01:11:28,917
All right, as you wish.

408
01:11:44,892 --> 01:11:47,268
Hurry up, Django, hurry!

409
01:11:53,859 --> 01:11:54,984
Watch out!

410
01:12:12,002 --> 01:12:16,297
Prepare the men, Miguel.
We're going hunting!

411
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:39,362
Take the carriage. Go via the valley
and you'll soon reach the pass.

412
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:40,530
You'll be safe there.

413
01:12:40,698 --> 01:12:41,781
And you?

414
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:46,619
It's time for me to cross that bridge.

415
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:52,250
I waited an entire life
waiting to bury Django in this coffin.

416
01:12:53,919 --> 01:12:56,713
The gold will help me
make him disappear forever.

417
01:12:56,714 --> 01:13:00,258
Let go of that gold, Django!
What do you care about it?

418
01:13:00,718 --> 01:13:07,056
We'll start a new life together.
I'll help you forget.

419
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:13,688
I love you, Django.

420
01:13:16,817 --> 01:13:19,527
I left love behind many years ago.

421
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:24,073
Now it rests under one of the many crosses
of the tombstone cemetery.

422
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:28,745
If I bring you with me,
you'd risk ending up the same way.

423
01:13:30,247 --> 01:13:34,459
And, maybe you wouldn't make me forget.

424
01:14:01,487 --> 01:14:03,071
Django!

425
01:14:08,827 --> 01:14:10,286
Oh, Django!

426
01:15:02,214 --> 01:15:04,507
Now that we meet again, Django...

427
01:15:06,927 --> 01:15:08,219
Where is the gold?

428
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:18,396
The mud swallowed it.

429
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:22,191
A horse stumbles, a coffin slips...

430
01:15:22,443 --> 01:15:24,193
it's fate, General.

431
01:15:29,241 --> 01:15:35,788
It certainly won't be the lost gold, my friend,
that will change my fate.

432
01:15:37,374 --> 01:15:42,337
We'll go back to Mexico anyway, right?
The decision has already been made.

433
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:44,881
Now we are even, Django.

434
01:15:45,049 --> 01:15:50,261
You saved my life two times,
and I did the same, back then and now.

435
01:15:50,429 --> 01:15:53,097
I'm not going to kill you.

436
01:15:53,432 --> 01:15:57,727
We don't kill thieves,
not even when they betray a friend.

437
01:15:57,936 --> 01:16:02,440
We punish thieves in a different manner.
Right, Miguel?

438
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:09,655
Bastard!

439
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:14,160
This is for our revolution!
And this is for the gold you stole!

440
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,120
Damn you!

441
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,959
Damn dog!

442
01:16:23,253 --> 01:16:25,296
Thief!

443
01:16:36,308 --> 01:16:38,726
You disgusting coward!

444
01:16:42,398 --> 01:16:44,065
It's your turn, men.

445
01:17:02,209 --> 01:17:06,754
However good a gunman is,
he still needs his hands, am I right Django?

446
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:11,926
Pray that Jackson doesn't find you.
It would be embarrassing for you.

447
01:17:12,469 --> 01:17:16,722
Goodbye now, Django.
My men and I will go back to Mexico...

448
01:17:17,015 --> 01:17:21,352
to win or to die.
Let's go, <i>Companeros!</i>

449
01:17:24,648 --> 01:17:27,608
Bye, <i>Gringo!</i>
We'll meet again in hell!

450
01:17:28,986 --> 01:17:30,278
Let's go!

451
01:19:57,926 --> 01:19:59,093
Pigs!

452
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:07,805
Help her, Nathaniel.

453
01:22:11,351 --> 01:22:15,563
I think she can still be saved.

454
01:22:17,107 --> 01:22:22,528
Alright. I'll do all that is possible.
But you leave now, don't stay here.

455
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:25,781
Jackson could come back here any moment.

456
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:31,495
Django, leave! Save yourself,
run away before it's too late.

457
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:33,748
Don't worry about me.

458
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:40,129
There is one more thing I have to do.
I have to kill Jackson.

459
01:22:41,381 --> 01:22:45,926
That's the only way for this town and I
to get back to life.

460
01:22:46,344 --> 01:22:48,971
One can't keep running away.

461
01:22:49,973 --> 01:22:55,770
One has to stop and fight to the very end.

462
01:22:56,772 --> 01:23:00,483
I understood that when I was squeezing
your hand tightly...

463
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:04,153
while the coffin was going down
in the Savannah.

464
01:23:04,529 --> 01:23:07,740
If I should fail,
then at least I will have tried...

465
01:23:11,703 --> 01:23:13,537
to redeem myself.

466
01:23:14,664 --> 01:23:17,583
Django, your... your hands.

467
01:23:19,878 --> 01:23:22,546
My hands will still be able to serve me.

468
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:30,513
Nathaniel, hide Maria,
and tell Jackson that I'll wait for him...

469
01:23:30,514 --> 01:23:34,391
at the crosses of the tombstone cemetery...

470
01:23:35,727 --> 01:23:40,022
because his time has come.

471
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:31,675
Django is waiting for you
at the crosses of the Tombstone cemetery.

472
01:25:31,843 --> 01:25:35,888
But you have nothing to fear.
They smashed his hands.

473
01:29:08,852 --> 01:29:11,395
You thought you had won, right, Django?

474
01:29:11,855 --> 01:29:15,649
Instead, here I am, to fight my war...

475
01:29:16,276 --> 01:29:18,110
a war that will never end.

476
01:29:19,028 --> 01:29:23,907
Praying is the right thing to do
when you're near death.

477
01:29:24,284 --> 01:29:28,162
You can't make the sign of the cross
with those hands!

478
01:29:29,622 --> 01:29:31,373
I will help you make it!

479
01:29:36,379 --> 01:29:38,589
In the name of the Father...

480
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:47,097
the Son...

481
01:29:53,313 --> 01:29:55,063
and the Holy...

482
01:29:58,943 --> 01:30:00,235
Spirit!

483
01:30:01,738 --> 01:30:02,863
Amen!

484
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:31,785
