1
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:13,813
Who are you?
- What?

2
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,235
Come outside!

3
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,354
I'm asking, who are you?
- Me? Ivo, but who are you?

4
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,200
Are you alone here?
- I am.

5
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:55,230
Are you russian?
- No, an estonian.

6
00:02:57,475 --> 00:03:01,306
What is an estonian doing here?
- This is my workshop.

7
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:08,330
What are these boxes for?
For explosives?

8
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,002
No, for tangerines (mandarynki).

9
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,561
If for tangerines, then it's fine.

10
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,794
Okay. Do you have any food?
We are hungry.

11
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:31,222
The food is in the house. There.
- Come, let's go.

12
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:44,901
Hop in the car.

13
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:53,866
TANGERINES (mandarynki)

14
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:12,796
Who do you have at home?
- Nobody, I live alone.

15
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:46,622
Step in, have a seat.

16
00:04:55,133 --> 00:05:00,733
We will sit, grandfather, but pack the food, we are moving on.
- Fine.

17
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:06,529
And don't be greedy.

18
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,879
Look, what a beautiful girl.
- Yes, a beauty.

19
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:31,787
Where is your family?
You have nobody?

20
00:05:33,638 --> 00:05:36,538
They all went home after the war started.

21
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:41,697
Where to?
- To Estonia.

22
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,675
And why did you stay?

23
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,706
I didn't want to leave.

24
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,563
Is this your daughter?
- Granddaughter.

25
00:05:57,084 --> 00:06:01,185
And don't say anything about her.
Don't even think about it.

26
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:09,125
I didn't even plan to. Ibrahim.

27
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:17,075
What's that?

28
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,359
Food.

29
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:32,003
You are a nice man, grandfather.
Sorry that you are so old.

30
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:35,281
I'm sorry that brave men like you get old.

31
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:39,599
What is happening out there?
An intense war?

32
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:42,347
Yes, old man.
You better leave to Estonia.

33
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,853
Not everyone will be as nice as us.

34
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,842
Does anyone live in these houses?
- No, they're all empty.

35
00:06:57,002 --> 00:07:00,063
There is only one guy living near the plantation.

36
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,673
But he only has tangerines (mandarynki).
I'm helping him.

37
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:06,155
We don't care about tangerines.

38
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:12,790
But the box-making business you have here is fine.
Well done!

39
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,945
Margus!

40
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:32,175
Margus!

41
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:04,234
Yes, wait!

42
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:13,052
Who were these guys?
Caucasians, they wanted food.

43
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:16,048
They didn't visit me.
- I know.

44
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:19,049
Did you get an agreement?
- Yes.

45
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:23,040
They agreed to send on the 7th,
20 soldiers, for one day.

46
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:25,707
In one day we will not make it.
Of course not.

47
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,292
We will pick as much as we can.
I already started.

48
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:34,269
Very well, if we will continue in the same tempo,
we will never get anything out of the fields.

49
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:38,699
In a few days there will probably be
an intensive battle over here.

50
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:43,496
These caucasians said, that soon there will be war over here.
- My army leader told the same.

51
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:47,349
I will make 10 boxes today, then there will be a total of 200,
Do you think it will be enough?

52
00:09:47,502 --> 00:09:52,123
Decide yourself. But I think we would need another 50.

53
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:54,562
Okay.

54
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:02,703
Don't kill yourself with the work,
there are still 5 days until the 7th.

55
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:06,065
The faster, the better.

56
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:09,361
(The war news from the radio.)

57
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,449
Margus!

58
00:12:43,668 --> 00:12:46,688
Margus!
- Yes.

59
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:51,605
You didn't get hit?
- No, I didn't.

60
00:12:51,724 --> 00:12:54,648
What happened here?
- I don't know.

61
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:59,502
This car was driving in the front,
the other one was following.

62
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:03,801
Shot the first car, which hit the fence.
Now my fence is ruined.

63
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:07,889
I was climbing a tree.
Hiding.

64
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:13,023
And then I saw someone shooting
with some kind of a weapon, i think it was a Minomet.

65
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:17,556
We can go nuts here, what was it?

66
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:21,277
Okay, calm down.

67
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:40,358
He is wounded, go check what is in the van.
And be careful!

68
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:49,362
Be calm...

69
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:10,057
What is there?
- All of them dead.

70
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:17,932
So georgian dzighits, where are you?
- Calm down.

71
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:29,127
How are things in heaven, you swines.
- Enough!

72
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,562
You shouldn't yell,
otherwise you might die.

73
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,243
Finally we were able to stop the bleeding.

74
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:41,167
But Ibrahim was killed?
- Start the car.

75
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:44,426
These bastards killed him, yes?
- Yes.

76
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:49,604
We are going to bury him now,
but you try to calm down.

77
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:55,724
We are going to invite a doctor for you.
Try to move less.

78
00:14:55,906 --> 00:15:00,308
Be careful out there, grandpa,
make sure there is nobody following you.

79
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:04,252
The georgian bastards might be after you.

80
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,869
Don't you worry, just lay there quietly.

81
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:12,062
Give me my machine gun.
- Why? There will be nobody coming here.

82
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:16,203
Give me. Anything could happen.
- I said there will be nobody.

83
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:54,904
Check the pockets,
maybe you will find documents.

84
00:16:55,103 --> 00:17:00,011
For what?
Maybe the relatives will start to search for them,

85
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:02,753
then we can bring them to the grave.

86
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:06,586
You are right.

87
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:22,850
These georgians are still boys.
Only this one is older.

88
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,821
Yes, still boys.

89
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:34,671
You know what?
Let's bury these georgians separately.

90
00:17:34,912 --> 00:17:37,984
And this one with the beard, separately farther here.

91
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:42,463
Then we will know who is where.
- Okay.

92
00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:58,767
This georgian is still alive.

93
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,225
Don't be afraid, it's us.

94
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:25,623
Who is this? Ibrahim? Still alive?
- No, it's not Ibrahim.

95
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,796
Who then?

96
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:44,991
Bring water in a bowl.
And a clean towel from the kitchen cupboard.

97
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:10,938
A piece of a bombshell is in his head.

98
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:15,426
Now we need Juhan,
otherwise he is not going to survive.

99
00:19:16,944 --> 00:19:19,266
The other one also needs a doctor.

100
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:32,955
Go fast and bring Juhan here.
And the van needs to be cleaned up.

101
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:36,871
It's easier with three of us.
- I have a good rope.

102
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:41,243
Wait!

103
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:50,207
Make sure he will keep his mouth shut.
- To whom could he tell? Everyone is gone.

104
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,825
To his wife.
- She is already in Estonia.

105
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,906
How are you?

106
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:16,842
Hurts?
- It's fine.

107
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:21,291
Thanks to Allah, already less.

108
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,872
Who did you bring here?

109
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:33,580
One georgian. He is heavily wounded.

110
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:37,075
What? Are you crazy?

111
00:20:37,216 --> 00:20:40,382
I'm going to kill him anyway.
Your effort was for nothing.

112
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:52,732
Okay, forgive me,
but they killed my friend.

113
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:56,972
And you didn't kill two of his?
Or can't you count?

114
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:03,328
I should have killed three.
Anyway, I will fix this.

115
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:07,404
You are nursing him for nothing. In vain.

116
00:21:31,116 --> 00:21:34,957
How is he?
- The chechen will be fine in a week.

117
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:39,590
But the georgian - I don't know.
Everything depends on his organism.

118
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,963
What will happen to the piece of the bomb?

119
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:53,987
Make sure that the injections are done at right times.
- Don't worry.

120
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,420
Why is he hallucinating all the time?
- It's good that the is hallucinating.

121
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:02,026
Maybe then he will survive.

122
00:22:02,127 --> 00:22:04,993
I will come back tomorrow, the same time.

123
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:12,806
How was it?
- He ate a bit. Now he fell asleep.

124
00:22:12,922 --> 00:22:19,364
Are we going?
- Wait, I will lock the door to the georgian.

125
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:25,284
We can not be sure, what the other lunatic might do.

126
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:42,528
Let's drive.
Sit behind the wheel.

127
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:14,096
Turn the wheel to the right. To the right!

128
00:23:15,323 --> 00:23:17,311
Very well!

129
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:22,701
Okay - push, push.

130
00:23:39,225 --> 00:23:41,806
I thought it's going to explode.

131
00:23:41,912 --> 00:23:46,491
It explodes in the cinema.
- The cinema is one big cheating.

132
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:19,505
How are you?
- Not bad.

133
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:25,079
I finished 20 boxes.
You can take them.

134
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:32,914
These wounded are ruining our business.

135
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:38,711
So what should I do now?
Kill them?

136
00:24:38,863 --> 00:24:43,981
Well I didn't mean that,
i was just saying.

137
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,312
Don't complain.

138
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:58,996
How many did you pick?
- All the boxes you brought yesterday are full.

139
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:03,773
Very good.
Did you visit my place?

140
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:07,859
Yes, I brought the key.
- Why didn't you leave it under the stairs?

141
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:12,009
What if someone would find it?
- Who would start looking for the key?

142
00:25:12,174 --> 00:25:15,163
If they want, they will just kick in the door.

143
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,151
How are they?
- Chechen is well.

144
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:24,630
He ate all the food. Seems that he is healing.

145
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:27,980
But the georgian?

146
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,856
Did you measure his temperature?
- What's the point.

147
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:37,899
His head is really hot, hallucinating all the time.

148
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,946
Leave the key here.

149
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,393
Should I help you carry the boxes?

150
00:25:45,475 --> 00:25:48,822
No need, I'm fine.
Do your work.

151
00:25:49,868 --> 00:25:54,463
I went to check the van.
There is nothing visible from the road.

152
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:13,839
What were you thinking?
- I will kill him anyway, grandpa.

153
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:21,564
Put him behind a thousand locks,
I will pay back for my friend.

154
00:27:21,746 --> 00:27:25,459
This is a holy thing for us, you will never understand.

155
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:30,797
To kill a person who is sleeping,

156
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:37,040
even if he is unconcious?
This is holy for you as well?

157
00:27:39,888 --> 00:27:41,878
I didn't know.

158
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,744
I will kill him, when he will start standing again.

159
00:28:20,217 --> 00:28:22,222
Soon there will be rain.

160
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,525
There will not.

161
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:32,144
They will be here soon.
- Who?

162
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,230
The georgians and russians.

163
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,919
And the tangerines will stay in the trees.

164
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,185
You know what this war is called?

165
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:53,454
The war of citrus.
- What do you mean?

166
00:28:53,626 --> 00:28:56,949
It's a war over my tangerines.

167
00:28:57,753 --> 00:28:59,663
Be normal.

168
00:29:01,013 --> 00:29:05,918
They are fighting for the land.
- For the land where my tangerines grow.

169
00:29:08,272 --> 00:29:11,678
You have gone crazy with your tangerines.

170
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:18,121
When the tangerines have been sold,
I will go to Estonia - it is now a free land.

171
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:23,103
The georgian gained consciousness.

172
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,562
Thank you.

173
00:29:53,636 --> 00:29:55,826
Thank you for everything.

174
00:29:57,402 --> 00:29:58,896
Try to speak less.

175
00:30:01,077 --> 00:30:03,830
I have a horrible headache.
- Don't worry.

176
00:30:03,945 --> 00:30:06,835
I'm going to make an injection and you will feel better.

177
00:30:06,954 --> 00:30:09,408
So this pig woke up?

178
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:15,008
Who is this?
- Don't mind. He is crazy.

179
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:27,705
I will kill him anyway, grandpa.
- Listen to me!

180
00:30:27,882 --> 00:30:32,387
In my house, nobody will kill anyone,
if I don't want it.

181
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:39,028
But if you are still planning to do it,
then you will have to kill me first.

182
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:44,953
Come on, grandpa. You saved my life.
- You heard, what I said.

183
00:30:46,697 --> 00:30:52,757
Okay. I will give my word,
that I will not kill him in your house.

184
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,759
But as soon as he will leave, I will do it.

185
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,654
I'm hoping to see you in Estonia.

186
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:17,284
When are you leaving?
- In the morning there will be a car picking me up.

187
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:21,260
Be careful.
- Don't worry.

188
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:24,673
Half an hour to the airport, and from there already home.

189
00:31:25,896 --> 00:31:27,912
God will guide me.

190
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:30,291
What are you doing here?

191
00:31:30,383 --> 00:31:33,690
Sell the tangerines and come home.

192
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:38,383
Our previous life has ended.
That's it, the end.

193
00:31:39,562 --> 00:31:42,560
You know very well why I will stay here.

194
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:45,617
You better think about you granddaughter.

195
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:50,381
Mari is fine, I'm not worried about her.

196
00:31:50,574 --> 00:31:54,313
Thank you, Juhan.

197
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,050
The medicine is in the drawer.
I left a note how to administer it.

198
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:12,503
Be strong.

199
00:33:12,998 --> 00:33:18,420
Already walking?
- I'm feeling better. Got tired of laying.

200
00:33:20,854 --> 00:33:22,961
My clothes fit you.

201
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,936
Take it slowly!

202
00:33:57,593 --> 00:33:59,719
You have to eat a lot.

203
00:34:02,664 --> 00:34:05,651
To gain power.
- I don't have an appetite.

204
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,357
I'm telling you, eat!

205
00:34:21,448 --> 00:34:23,618
Do you want tea?
- Yes.

206
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:28,155
Thanks for saving me.

207
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:34,275
You're welcome. Eat.

208
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:39,972
I'm apologizing again for what I said.

209
00:34:40,116 --> 00:34:44,943
I'm angry. But normally we respect older people. A lot.

210
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:48,383
Apology accepted.

211
00:34:56,308 --> 00:34:59,223
Does the wound hurt you?
- Not much.

212
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:14,190
Where did you bury my friend?
- In the forest.

213
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:26,504
What's your name?
- Ahmed.

214
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:33,504
But you don't care about my name?

215
00:35:36,945 --> 00:35:40,050
I care.
- I am Ivo.

216
00:35:42,065 --> 00:35:44,145
I'm a chechen, a fighter.

217
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:48,874
A mercenary?
- Yes.

218
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:54,814
It's clear.

219
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:02,844
Do you have any family?
- I do.

220
00:36:04,823 --> 00:36:09,233
They are the reason why I joined the war.
I'm paid well.

221
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:16,854
You joined the war because of them?
- Don't start preaching me.

222
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,735
I said that I respect old people,

223
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:23,309
but this is not your business.
Not your business, Ivo.

224
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:27,194
You are right, I'm Ivo.

225
00:36:45,758 --> 00:36:49,712
Ivo...

226
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:53,842
Where is my gun?
- In a safe place.

227
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:58,675
When you will be better, I will return it to you.
Also the trophy weapons of the georgians.

228
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:00,955
These belong to you as well?

229
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:16,717
I would like to ask you something.
- Then ask.

230
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:21,448
I have to tell you, that if I will give my word of honor,

231
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:25,469
then I would rather die than break it.
- Exactly. Me too.

232
00:37:27,442 --> 00:37:30,242
That means I don't have to lock this door anymore?

233
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,523
Listen Ivo, you estonian,

234
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:35,624
would rather die than break the word of honor.

235
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:41,049
But you are asking me, a caucasian, if I will keep mine?

236
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:43,445
This means everything for us.

237
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:47,411
I promised not to kill in your house,
that means, I will not.

238
00:37:47,572 --> 00:37:50,081
Fine.

239
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:55,397
But estonian or caucasian, there is no difference.

240
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:04,949
Ivo, why didn't you leave to Estonia?

241
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:09,233
This is none of your business, young man.

242
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:28,689
Our work will be pointless,
if there will be no one to help us.

243
00:38:28,872 --> 00:38:34,602
In this time I managed to pick only two boxes.
I'm not able to pick any more.

244
00:38:34,841 --> 00:38:38,592
If there will be no help tomorrow,
then we will burn.

245
00:38:40,432 --> 00:38:42,758
What did the major excactly tell you?

246
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:46,520
That they are coming,
if nothing will happen in the meanwhile.

247
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:48,856
If nothing will happen.

248
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:52,835
Well if they are not sent elsewhere.
And they will not be sent

249
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:58,952
They have been guarding the village road for two weeks already,
why should something happen exactly tomorrow.

250
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:03,910
I don't know.

251
00:39:03,992 --> 00:39:06,209
It would be really weird if,

252
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:10,216
soldiers would start to pick tangerines in the middle of the war.

253
00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:14,100
You are weird yourself, the major promised.

254
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:22,978
May the god help us.
I'm hoping too.

255
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:29,096
Don't you worry Ivo. They will come.

256
00:39:40,817 --> 00:39:43,643
(The war news from the radio.)

257
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:49,946
Slowly, slowly.

258
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,832
There's no hurry.

259
00:40:02,431 --> 00:40:04,638
Good boy.

260
00:40:08,404 --> 00:40:10,305
Sit down.

261
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,564
How are you feeling yourself?
- My head is spinning a bit.

262
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:21,774
That's nothing.

263
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:27,459
We found this from your head.

264
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,443
And these from your pockets.

265
00:40:48,803 --> 00:40:50,402
Do you want tea?
- Yes.

266
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:15,562
Ahmed, drink your tea,
or it will cool down.

267
00:41:45,424 --> 00:41:52,087
Okay, enemies.
He is Ahmed and he is Nika.

268
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:55,173
It's a pleasure.

269
00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:00,492
You know georgian. Probably you know already
that there is no reason to be afrait.

270
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:07,041
I promised to our life-saver that
I will not kill you in his house.

271
00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:10,721
So if you want to live, don't go outside.

272
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:18,035
Don't even put your head out of the window,
I will chop it off.

273
00:42:27,434 --> 00:42:30,938
But can he piss outside from the window?

274
00:42:34,891 --> 00:42:36,595
Enough!

275
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:43,607
Enough.

276
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:03,076
Forgive me, Ivo.

277
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,953
They didn't come, did they?

278
00:43:57,806 --> 00:44:00,209
Do you want tea?

279
00:44:03,132 --> 00:44:05,906
Doesn't matter, these tangerines.

280
00:44:06,743 --> 00:44:12,294
It is stupid to start making business with tangerines
in the middle of the war.

281
00:44:25,618 --> 00:44:28,868
Does he happen to be your relative, by chance?

282
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:37,369
Margus!

283
00:44:58,326 --> 00:45:00,701
Step in, what are you standing there.

284
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,581
I don't know, I thought that maybe you got offended.

285
00:45:08,065 --> 00:45:11,526
What are you talking about, come in.

286
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:16,250
Let's sit outside.
It's a nice weather.

287
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:21,787
I don't want to leave them on their own for too long.

288
00:45:56,551 --> 00:46:00,169
Aren't you afraid that they are going to kill each other?

289
00:46:02,368 --> 00:46:04,861
The chechen gave his word of honor.

290
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:09,832
And you trust him?
- I do.

291
00:46:11,705 --> 00:46:16,179
But the georgian?
- He too.

292
00:46:18,438 --> 00:46:22,571
Well, if it was the word of honor...

293
00:46:23,479 --> 00:46:28,071
Don't be surprised. There are still people who keep their word.

294
00:46:30,351 --> 00:46:33,813
And both of them are in your house?

295
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:37,162
Don't nag.

296
00:46:40,271 --> 00:46:43,134
Maybe you want one of them to move to my place?

297
00:46:47,363 --> 00:46:52,257
The battle took place in front of your house,
they ran over your fence.

298
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:58,247
From your house, from upstairs even the van is visible.

299
00:47:01,337 --> 00:47:06,442
It's safer at my place.
- You're right.

300
00:47:09,603 --> 00:47:12,010
Come to visit me in the evening.

301
00:47:15,021 --> 00:47:18,633
The boys are going to sleep ealry. Let's drink a bit.
- Okay.

302
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,024
So in the evening then.

303
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:31,152
Don't get angry now... but maybe you will
come to Estonia together with me?

304
00:48:31,297 --> 00:48:36,538
Ivo, maybe we will find another song?
This one is making me crazy.

305
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:40,569
But I like it. I'm listening.

306
00:49:11,576 --> 00:49:14,691
But what kind of music do you like, georgian?

307
00:49:16,985 --> 00:49:20,693
This one not.
- Georgian music?

308
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:30,688
I like georgian music.
- And also the land that belongs to Georgia?

309
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:35,047
Where is the Georgian land?
- Here.

310
00:49:35,215 --> 00:49:38,428
This, on what you are sitting,
is the land of Georgia.

311
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:41,389
You are sitting on Georgian land.
- No.

312
00:49:41,507 --> 00:49:45,165
I'm sitting on an Estonian chair.
- Very funny.

313
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:49,502
Yes, on an estonian chair, which is in an estonian house,

314
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:52,066
which is standing on the land of Abkhazia.

315
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:56,837
Listen, have you even been to school?
Do you even have schools?

316
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,762
What?
- I'm asking if you even have schools?

317
00:50:02,312 --> 00:50:06,525
What are you smiling, foreigner?
What did you lose in Georgia?

318
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,566
I'm protecting a small nation from foreigners like you.

319
00:50:11,768 --> 00:50:15,072
Seems, that you really don't have any schools.

320
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:18,801
You don't understand anything.
You don't know anything.

321
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:22,386
Have you studied history?
Read any books?

322
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:28,450
I will not take your words to my heart.
I don't care what you are babbling.

323
00:50:28,616 --> 00:50:31,941
Here you are safe, babble as much as you want.

324
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,898
Listen, let's go outside at once.
- You don't even have power to walk.

325
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:39,740
I could even kill you with a rag,
that would not be very manly.

326
00:50:39,894 --> 00:50:43,466
If you will finally be healthy, then we will see,
what will happen to you.

327
00:50:43,614 --> 00:50:46,304
You damn bastard!

328
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:54,093
Don't jump, if your ass doesn't carry you!
You little worm.

329
00:50:57,026 --> 00:51:01,626
Go away from my land, you bastard!
- Im telling you, you idiot,

330
00:51:01,817 --> 00:51:04,030
this is not the land of Georgia!

331
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:08,493
Go and sleep, you don't have much time left.
- Enough, Ahmed!

332
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,890
I'm sorry, Ivo, but tell him as well to keep his mouth shut.

333
00:51:16,025 --> 00:51:18,244
Your mouth will be shut really soon!

334
00:51:23,673 --> 00:51:25,450
Slowly...

335
00:52:11,076 --> 00:52:14,443
Good morning, Ivo!
- Good morning.

336
00:52:14,582 --> 00:52:18,254
How are you?
- Getting better.

337
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:21,031
It's good when you are getting better.

338
00:52:24,404 --> 00:52:26,841
And where is your enemy?
Still sleeping?

339
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,900
No, the enemy is not sleeping.
Good morning.

340
00:52:30,938 --> 00:52:33,326
How is your head?
- Almost doesn't hurt anymore.

341
00:52:33,424 --> 00:52:36,556
If I'm standing. It's difficult to lay down.

342
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:40,818
But take and example from horses. Sleep while standing.

343
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:45,799
Was I talking to you?
- Do horses even talk?

344
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:49,491
What a humour.
It suits with your intelligence level.

345
00:52:50,864 --> 00:52:52,711
Okay, I will keep myself back.

346
00:53:08,892 --> 00:53:12,064
Do you want tea?
- Yes.

347
00:53:13,504 --> 00:53:15,939
I will pour you, brother...?

348
00:53:17,284 --> 00:53:19,642
...on your head?
- You can try, you bastard.

349
00:53:22,113 --> 00:53:23,772
Again.

350
00:53:36,852 --> 00:53:38,446
Thank you.

351
00:54:10,172 --> 00:54:15,347
Ivo, is this your daughter?

352
00:54:15,562 --> 00:54:18,203
No, granddaughter.

353
00:54:23,781 --> 00:54:26,311
What's her name?

354
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:33,306
It's not your business.
- Some kind of cars are coming here.

355
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:51,257
Ahmed, these are abkhazians.

356
00:54:51,348 --> 00:54:54,007
When they will enter, you will turn him in?

357
00:54:54,117 --> 00:54:57,870
Of course not, I have to kill him myself.
- Good.

358
00:54:58,026 --> 00:55:02,312
Then we will tell them, that he is Ibrahim and that you killed all the georgians.

359
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:05,786
And nobody is asking anything from me?
Ivo, give me my machine gun!

360
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:11,665
Don't be stupid.

361
00:55:11,758 --> 00:55:16,406
You can't talk, because you have a wound in your head.
That's it. You will sit silently.

362
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,781
Do you know why you have to be silent?

363
00:55:20,872 --> 00:55:23,625
Because first of all they would shoot me.

364
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:28,240
Even if they are talking bad about georgians, you will be silent.

365
00:55:31,257 --> 00:55:34,255
So, he can't talk because of his wound.

366
00:55:40,535 --> 00:55:43,185
Hello, Ivo.
- Hello, Aslan.

367
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:45,958
Hey, we saw a georgian van.

368
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:49,622
In the gorge, next to Margus's plantation.

369
00:55:51,968 --> 00:55:54,040
And you have a car at your place.

370
00:55:54,126 --> 00:55:56,348
Aha, Margus. You are here.

371
00:55:56,441 --> 00:56:01,045
What happened here? Where are the georgians?

372
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:07,090
All dead. The chechens killed them. But we rescued two chechens.

373
00:56:08,179 --> 00:56:11,598
They are here, wounded.
- In your house?

374
00:56:13,259 --> 00:56:17,405
Step in, I will introduce you.
- Yes, I would shake their hands.

375
00:56:17,578 --> 00:56:19,602
Come in.

376
00:56:27,055 --> 00:56:30,810
Sit, brother, you are wounded.
- It's nothing.

377
00:56:30,965 --> 00:56:33,234
Aslan.
- Ahmed.

378
00:56:37,647 --> 00:56:39,365
Aslan.

379
00:56:47,005 --> 00:56:51,023
He is Ibrahim, but he can't talk. He got wounded from his head.

380
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:55,335
What... damn bastards.

381
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:01,173
How is this possible?
He got wounded from his head and tongue doesn't work?

382
00:57:03,776 --> 00:57:07,145
You fool. My neighbour got hit to the head with a brick,

383
00:57:07,286 --> 00:57:09,716
and his legs stopped working.

384
00:57:09,816 --> 00:57:14,430
There are spots in the head, that control all the body parts.

385
00:57:14,621 --> 00:57:19,781
For example, here can be the spot for the leg, here for the hand.
Do you understand?

386
00:57:19,996 --> 00:57:23,262
He didn't understand a shit.

387
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:31,130
I've got good vodka. Sit.
- No, Ivo, we are going straight to the battle front.

388
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,640
We heard that the things are fucked up over there.

389
00:57:34,729 --> 00:57:38,619
And what will happen next?
- We will chase them out.

390
00:57:38,781 --> 00:57:43,519
Do you doubt in it?
- No, Aslan, of course not.

391
00:57:43,715 --> 00:57:46,789
These boys will help.

392
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:50,323
How many georgians were there?
- Three.

393
00:57:50,464 --> 00:57:54,943
They bumped into us on the road and started shooting at once.

394
00:57:56,482 --> 00:57:58,731
We turned around, they were following us.

395
00:57:58,824 --> 00:58:02,771
Ibrahim got a bullet to his head, and we hit the fence.

396
00:58:02,935 --> 00:58:05,145
And drove into the plantation.

397
00:58:05,236 --> 00:58:11,316
I had enough time to hit them with an anti-tank rocket.
- Well done, Ahmed.

398
00:58:11,569 --> 00:58:16,970
The bodies are in the van?
- No. We buried them in the forest.

399
00:58:18,404 --> 00:58:23,650
It would have been better to throw them on the road, like dogs.

400
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:27,145
Aslan, they are people too, and young people.

401
00:58:27,281 --> 00:58:29,583
Fine, so be it.

402
00:58:29,678 --> 00:58:34,776
Get well.
Most important is, that you would start talking again.

403
00:58:34,988 --> 00:58:38,251
As soon as we will get on our feet, we will join you.

404
00:58:38,387 --> 00:58:40,726
Thank you Ahmed, we are brothers.

405
00:58:50,648 --> 00:58:57,817
Aslan...

406
00:58:58,115 --> 00:59:00,155
Do something good.

407
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:02,569
I know, it's a bad time at the moment,

408
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:06,408
but Margus is losing a big tangerine crop.

409
00:59:06,563 --> 00:59:09,947
One major promised to send men, but he didn't.

410
00:59:10,087 --> 00:59:14,716
Maybe you can help us.
We will divide the money later.

411
00:59:14,908 --> 00:59:19,383
How many men do you need?
- 30 maybe, 40 would be better.

412
00:59:19,569 --> 00:59:23,471
No problem. In the morning the day after tomorrow, the men will be here.

413
00:59:23,633 --> 00:59:27,052
We are camping next to the river for three days.

414
00:59:27,194 --> 00:59:32,614
And don't give any money. Just give the boys a few boxes of tangerines.

415
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:37,870
Thank you Aslan.
We will be waiting.

416
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:40,549
The day after tomorrow.
You have my word.

417
00:59:59,755 --> 01:00:04,076
See, Ahmed, the georgian is outside, do you want to kill him?

418
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,168
I'm too lazy to kill him today.

419
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:15,198
Margus! Aslan promised to send 40 men for the day after tomorrow.

420
01:00:15,415 --> 01:00:17,606
Very well then!

421
01:00:27,446 --> 01:00:31,222
Only with ashes, Margus. Not with the flame.
- I know.

422
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:41,482
Aren't you cold? I will bring a jacket?
- No, thank you, Ivo, I'm not.

423
01:00:44,126 --> 01:00:48,584
What are you planning to do, when you will get better?
Back to the war?

424
01:00:52,332 --> 01:00:54,315
You don't know yet?
- I know.

425
01:00:54,397 --> 01:00:57,923
And everything is ready.

426
01:00:59,575 --> 01:01:03,995
Now taste and tell me if you
have eaten anything like that before.

427
01:01:05,647 --> 01:01:07,704
We will try.

428
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:10,978
Like we would have never eaten before.
- Try it, then talk.

429
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:15,093
Delicious.

430
01:01:16,204 --> 01:01:18,313
You georgians don't know how to make shashlik.

431
01:01:19,647 --> 01:01:23,107
But you think you can, just like with everything else.

432
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:28,241
Everything else?
What else can't we do then?

433
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:32,563
Many things.
- Like what?

434
01:01:37,772 --> 01:01:40,416
For example you don't know how to fight.
You absolutely don't know.

435
01:01:44,211 --> 01:01:47,729
Laugh, as much as you want.
You don't know how, but still you are fighting.

436
01:01:47,876 --> 01:01:50,958
And you are losing every time.
And this is already funny.

437
01:01:51,085 --> 01:01:56,081
You are talking nonsense.
I'm telling, you are uneducated.

438
01:01:56,289 --> 01:02:00,351
You don't know history at all.
- That doesn't change anything.

439
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,990
You don't know how to make shashlik,
you don't know how to fight. That's a fact.

440
01:02:04,135 --> 01:02:06,664
I will show you what I can do.

441
01:02:06,768 --> 01:02:09,037
Do it, kill me as you promised.

442
01:02:09,132 --> 01:02:12,313
We are not in the house. So try.

443
01:02:13,377 --> 01:02:17,368
Then you will see what a georgian is capable of. Make a try!

444
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:22,000
Okay. Let's see.

445
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:27,728
Calm down!

446
01:02:29,261 --> 01:02:31,716
Sit down.

447
01:02:33,944 --> 01:02:36,521
Sit!

448
01:02:39,147 --> 01:02:41,051
It's enough of this.

449
01:02:42,198 --> 01:02:45,406
Otherwise I will honestly kill you the same way I saved you.

450
01:02:52,386 --> 01:02:57,213
What is wrong with you, young men?
All the time, I will kill, I will kill...

451
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,723
Who gave you the right for that?

452
01:03:06,075 --> 01:03:08,884
Who?
- The war.

453
01:03:11,562 --> 01:03:13,567
Stupid!

454
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:19,562
I will pour you?
- Pour if you want.

455
01:03:21,689 --> 01:03:26,403
I can't pour to you yet. You are sick.
But let's say, symbolically.

456
01:03:27,712 --> 01:03:30,593
I don't drink, don't pour to me.

457
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:41,665
What will we drink for?
- For the death!

458
01:03:44,934 --> 01:03:46,952
Take, Margus.

459
01:03:49,779 --> 01:03:51,654
I can't drink for the death.

460
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:58,358
Why? It's their own mother.

461
01:04:01,895 --> 01:04:04,236
They are the children of death.

462
01:04:05,698 --> 01:04:11,223
Forgive me, Ivo.
In the name of Allah, it will not happen again.

463
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:17,852
What does it matter where you will kill each other,
here or somewhere else.

464
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:21,484
You will get well, go to the battle front, and kill there.

465
01:04:25,584 --> 01:04:28,722
It's foolish to force you to sit behind the same table.

466
01:04:32,803 --> 01:04:38,460
I will drink for life.
- No. For the death.

467
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:44,247
I raised the toast for the death.

468
01:05:10,262 --> 01:05:12,350
Margus?
- Yes.

469
01:05:12,438 --> 01:05:15,348
Did you solve your tangerine problem?

470
01:05:16,749 --> 01:05:23,268
Yes. I guess I'm bothering you all with my tangerines.
- Not at all.

471
01:05:23,539 --> 01:05:29,668
Look, it's not about money, even though the amounts are big.

472
01:05:29,922 --> 01:05:34,417
It's just that a crop like this is going to waste... It's a pity.

473
01:05:34,604 --> 01:05:41,317
We could help you.
- Yes.

474
01:05:41,595 --> 01:05:44,601
Don't bother, I have alreadymany helpers.

475
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:49,996
Let's see what Ivo will do. I think he got offended.

476
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:53,594
Ivo didn't get offended, Ivo is pissing.

477
01:06:38,243 --> 01:06:43,524
They were probably trying to bombard Aslan, by the river.

478
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,712
Maybe you will eat something?

479
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:02,799
Good morning.
- Good morning.

480
01:08:21,284 --> 01:08:23,417
Hello, Ivo.
- Hello.

481
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:56,731
I want to give you some money, so that you could go home to Estonia.

482
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:04,662
What are you talking about? I can't accept such money.

483
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:09,462
What kind of money?
- That kind.

484
01:09:11,379 --> 01:09:13,507
I'm a mercenary, this is my pay.

485
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:53,420
We respect christianity.
- We also respect other beliefs.

486
01:09:53,633 --> 01:09:57,578
But why did you start talking about religion, all of a sudden.

487
01:09:57,741 --> 01:09:59,926
For no reason.

488
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:17,038
Who were these other georgians to you?

489
01:10:19,004 --> 01:10:21,480
Why are you asking?
- I'm interested.

490
01:10:23,323 --> 01:10:28,721
Not very close friends. We met here. But they were good men.

491
01:10:32,177 --> 01:10:38,213
Ibrahim was like a brother to me. We grew up together.
- I'm sorry.

492
01:10:42,441 --> 01:10:46,291
We need firewood. I will bring.
- Sit down, let me do it.

493
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:49,837
No, I will go, I can walk around outside as well.

494
01:10:59,975 --> 01:11:04,597
I'm also sorry that your companions were killed. Good men.

495
01:11:25,237 --> 01:11:28,176
You should have taken it, he was offering with his heart.

496
01:11:37,898 --> 01:11:40,224
I will go and help him.

497
01:11:52,071 --> 01:11:54,714
Let me help you.
- No, I need to move.

498
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:20,688
You are looking really often at the photo of my granddaughter.

499
01:12:20,871 --> 01:12:24,128
Why?
- I'm not, you're wrong.

500
01:12:29,821 --> 01:12:34,808
No, you are looking.
- To be honest, she is really beautiful.

501
01:12:35,015 --> 01:12:38,333
It seems I can't get my eyes off of her.

502
01:12:38,471 --> 01:12:40,682
Forgive me, Ivo.

503
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:46,656
In reality she is even prettier.
Her name is Mari.

504
01:12:50,859 --> 01:12:52,643
She is everything to me.

505
01:12:54,144 --> 01:12:58,292
Mari lives in Estonia?
- She used to live in this house.

506
01:13:00,177 --> 01:13:04,075
She left together with the others, when the war started.

507
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:09,144
Why didn't you leave?
Was it difficult to leave from here?

508
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:11,565
You love this place here?

509
01:13:13,212 --> 01:13:17,839
I love. And I hate.

510
01:13:22,323 --> 01:13:25,974
Do you have any family?
- Only my mother.

511
01:13:26,125 --> 01:13:28,509
My father died ten years ago.

512
01:13:28,609 --> 01:13:31,011
Do you have any sisters or brothers?
- No, I'm the only one.

513
01:13:32,852 --> 01:13:35,332
And what were you doing during the peace time?

514
01:13:35,436 --> 01:13:39,128
I'm an actor. Playing in a theatre.
- Really?

515
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:44,364
In the movies too?
- Rarely.

516
01:13:44,468 --> 01:13:48,613
There are no movies produced here anymore. There is no money.

517
01:13:48,785 --> 01:13:55,430
And then you decided to join the war.
- Yes, I felt the obligation, and went.

518
01:13:55,707 --> 01:13:57,820
I didn't even tell my mother.

519
01:14:01,387 --> 01:14:06,338
When the war is over, I will come to Thibilisi

520
01:14:06,543 --> 01:14:13,287
and I will watch you acting.
Later we will bring back the memory of these days.

521
01:14:15,062 --> 01:14:20,551
And Ahmed.
- No. Ahmed will be sitting in the theatre with me.

522
01:14:22,836 --> 01:14:24,678
And he will applaude for you.

523
01:14:49,194 --> 01:14:51,875
Come here! You!

524
01:14:53,993 --> 01:14:55,885
Don't show yourself! Sit quietly!

525
01:14:55,963 --> 01:14:59,514
Where are the machine guns?
- There, under the bed.

526
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:02,041
But don't touch them.

527
01:15:04,193 --> 01:15:08,030
What are you smiling, you georian?
- I'm not georgian.

528
01:15:08,188 --> 01:15:10,660
Are you sure?
- He is one of you, men.

529
01:15:12,606 --> 01:15:16,901
Stay put, old man.
- I'm a chechen.

530
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:21,663
Then say something in chechenian language.
- I'm a chechen.

531
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:27,830
I came to fight on your side,
got wounded and he helped me to heal.

532
01:15:28,042 --> 01:15:32,567
Comrade officer, I know your major.
- Be silent!

533
01:15:34,203 --> 01:15:37,957
Are you stupid or what?
Say something in chechenian.

534
01:15:39,747 --> 01:15:41,327
Say something, you dickhead!

535
01:15:44,864 --> 01:15:47,222
And what does it mean?

536
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:49,506
No, I think he is a georgian.

537
01:15:49,597 --> 01:15:53,563
Are you deaf?
- That was "dickhead" in chechenian.

538
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:58,424
Shit, shoot him!
- No, he is one of us!

539
01:15:58,551 --> 01:16:00,795
I told you to shut up! Fill my order!

540
01:16:00,887 --> 01:16:03,229
Captain, maybe he is one of us?
- No!

541
01:16:35,746 --> 01:16:37,348
Nika, throw me the machine gun!

542
01:16:44,615 --> 01:16:46,611
Cover me!

543
01:17:05,441 --> 01:17:07,939
That's it Nika, that's it!
They are dead.

544
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:22,286
Margus!

545
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:51,722
Dickhead...

546
01:20:00,798 --> 01:20:03,543
Ready?
- Yes.

547
01:20:05,929 --> 01:20:08,073
Only your cross is left.

548
01:20:11,156 --> 01:20:13,431
Like that?
- Yes.

549
01:20:17,643 --> 01:20:22,102
And Nika?
- We will bury him to another place.

550
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:27,484
Where?
- Next to my son.

551
01:20:41,138 --> 01:20:44,257
How did he die?
- He fell when the war started.

552
01:20:45,784 --> 01:20:48,240
Who killed him?
- God knows.

553
01:20:48,342 --> 01:20:53,439
He went to the war right in the beginning.
To protect our land, he said.

554
01:20:55,452 --> 01:20:57,444
I tried to convince him not to go,

555
01:20:57,526 --> 01:21:02,051
I told him that this is nobody's war, but he wouldn't listen.

556
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:07,933
So the georgians killed him?
- Yes.

557
01:21:09,861 --> 01:21:12,845
But what difference does it make?
- How so?

558
01:21:14,618 --> 01:21:17,467
You buried a georgian next to your son.

559
01:21:19,238 --> 01:21:21,102
Ahmed, does it matter?

560
01:21:25,021 --> 01:21:30,186
Answer me!
- No, it doesn't.

561
01:21:39,804 --> 01:21:43,968
Are you going straight home?
- I miss my family.

562
01:21:47,659 --> 01:21:49,944
Ivo, tell me...

563
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:53,039
If I would have been killed instead of Nika,

564
01:21:53,164 --> 01:22:00,626
would you have buried me next to your son?
- Yes.

565
01:22:02,928 --> 01:22:05,006
Maybe a little farther.

566
01:22:11,786 --> 01:22:14,242
I really don't know, how to thank you.

567
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:19,177
Go!
I don't like goodbyes.
