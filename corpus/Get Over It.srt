1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,370
She was the first
girl to see me naked.

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,530
Granted we were 7 years old
at the time, but I had a feeling.

3
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,170
There's really something about the
first girl you play doctor with...

4
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,010
or perhaps it's just that she's seen
your package and didn't run away.

5
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,290
Whatever it was, Allison and I were
made for each other. A perfect fit.

6
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,210
So, when her family moved away,
I knew that someday, somehow...

7
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,370
fate would bring
us back together.

8
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,330
Berke.

9
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,970
Berke Landers.

10
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,130
It 's me, Allison.
Allison McAIlister.

11
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,530
Of all the lunchrooms in all
the schools in all the world...

12
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,010
that day she walked into mine.
It was the perfect romance.

13
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,090
I was dating the most
beautiful girl in school.

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,250
And the cool part,
we still played doctor.

15
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,930
Forthe first time in my
life, I was in love...

16
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,850
and I knew it would
last forever.

17
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,730
Boy, was I a dumb ass.

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,970
We need to talk.

19
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:35,050
You know, everything in life,
even the really great things...

20
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,730
run their course
eventually, right?

21
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,890
Trends fade, bread moulds...

22
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,130
people die.

23
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,850
I guess...

24
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,490
Remember the first
time we kissed?

25
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,050
The feeling, the sparks?

26
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,810
Well, now when we kiss...

27
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,330
the feeling is kind of...

28
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,170
is kind of gone.

29
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,730
And Berke...

30
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,410
I packed up most of your stuff.
I thought it 'd be easier.

31
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,090
Thanks.

32
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,210
My parents, Frank and Beverly, they
host the relationship-advice show...

33
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,850
"Love Matters",
which sounds pretty cool.

34
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,610
- This maximizes the pleasure for both.
- Exactly, right.

35
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,170
While simultaneously, allowing
for face-to-face intimacy...

36
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,570
Coolio knows what we're talking
about. You wanna take her for a spin?

37
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,570
We'll be right back.

38
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,930
- I have the CDs you wanted, mom.
- Thanks, honey.

39
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,770
The guests get so cranky when
you haven't heard their music.

40
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,690
You came home so early last night.
Don't make it too flat.

41
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,210
- Is everything okay with Allison?
- No. So maybe we can talk about it.

42
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,890
Berke, you know the rule. When
we are not feeling sunny, we...

43
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,010
- I don't really wanna talk about it.
- I believe the word is "share".

44
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,530
Frank, hon, apparently Berke
has a problem with Allison.

45
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,970
- Snafu in the communication channel?
- Boundary issues?

46
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,690
- Codependency?
- No, it 's nothing like that.

47
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,570
- Five minutes, people.
- Sex.

48
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,370
She dumped me.

49
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,010
Poor baby.

50
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,130
This probably isn't the
best place to talk about this.

51
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,170
- I wanna go home.
- You're gonna be fine, man.

52
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,890
It 's gonna be better than fine. Look
at all these new and interesting...

53
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,850
Hey, that 's my sister?

54
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,490
Hey, grabby hands,
step away from the sister.

55
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,770
Shouldn't you be in like a pajama
jammy jam or something?

56
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,090
What am I, a year younger than you?
Hard to tell from your presents.

57
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,930
- Pink roller blades.
- It was a great gift.

58
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,930
- Sure.
- Can I help you?

59
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,490
Come on, there's a guy in the corner
who'll pierce our navels for free.

60
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,690
- What?
- He's here. He's here.

61
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,770
- So?
- I told him I was going out of town.

62
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,130
He's gonna freak when
he finds that I'm here.

63
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,570
Al, you're free now. Don't you think
he needs to start dealing with that?

64
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,170
You should've seen the look on his
face, Maggie. He was devastated.

65
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,810
- It 's gonna be a while till he gets over.
- Are you sure you're over this?

66
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,330
Allow me.

67
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,850
Who is that? Ouch!

68
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,570
Is this like your first
time in the States?

69
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,090
Well... Lucky, right?

70
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,330
Are you guys listening
to this candy-ass?

71
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,570
My father's in the foreign service.
So I spent the last few years abroad.

72
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,930
Shanghai, Netherlands.

73
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,690
In Amsterdam, I toured a bit with a
pop group called Swing Town Lads.

74
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,570
- You know, I knew he looked familiar.
- And the accent? Sounds like Madonna.

75
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,250
- She's here.
- Who, Madonna?

76
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,210
No, Allison.

77
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:40,770
- It 's perfect.
- No. You are not going over there.

78
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,530
You go over there, you might as
well put your stick on a cracker.

79
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,810
It 's only gonna make you her bitch.
You don't want that, it 's bad!

80
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,570
Felix, I've taken pisses longer
than your last three relationships.

81
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,330
- Thanks.
- You okay?

82
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,090
Yes. Yeah. I think so.

83
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,770
It 's a tad rough and tumble out
there. Glad I was here to catch you.

84
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,570
I'm glad you were too.

85
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,090
You care to dance?

86
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,370
- She's not your girlfriend anymore!
- Maybe that 's not such a bad thing.

87
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,290
Next year, you'll go to different
schools. Were you gonna marry her?

88
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,370
- Who marries the high school friend?
- And don't say McCauley Culkin.

89
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,090
I think I'm gonna call her.

90
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,930
No! Negative!
Have some self-respect, man!

91
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,330
You've called her
4O times already.

92
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,530
- Get out of my way!
- Shit!

93
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,170
I stand at attention
whenever you're near

94
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,050
Full speed ahead, girl
'cause it's clear

95
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,970
that you are my love S.C.U.D.

96
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,370
- He calls himself Striker.
- "Love S.C.U.D."?

97
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,490
So what did you say when
he gave it to you?

98
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,930
I don't know.
He asked me out.

99
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,610
Don't be so nonchalant
about it, girl.

100
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,450
I think that boy
is razor fine.

101
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,290
It's so funny to be seeing
you after so long

102
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,370
- My God!
- Berke, don't, don't!

103
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,450
And the way you look I understand
that you aren't impressed

104
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,290
I heard you let a little
friend of mine

105
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,530
take off your party dress

106
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,090
Allison

107
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,370
I can't believe you dated
that loser for a year.

108
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,090
Did you hear that? The neighbors are
screaming at you, Berke. Come on.

109
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,890
My aim is

110
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,610
Berke, your aim sucks.

111
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,570
All right, a little to the left.
What direction do you think left is?

112
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,730
If you go with your instinct and
reverse it, we have something.

113
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,930
How difficult is this?
I'm so alone, I think.

114
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,530
- I'm trying. You're intimidating me.
- You are frightening me. Understand?

115
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,930
How do you get dressed in the
morning? Do people come in?

116
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,290
"A Midsummer Night 's
Rocking Eve"?

117
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,050
Classical Shakespeare with
a contemporary musical twist.

118
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,370
Hello? My God, how
did you get this number?

119
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,490
You're kidding me.

120
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,290
Okay, either that man has no
taste or he completely hates us.

121
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,450
I think it 's a little of both.

122
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,490
- Lazario, how's that lobotomy?
- Así así.

123
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,330
What 's with the smiling? A week ago,
you were mired in rejected-guy mode.

124
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,090
- You passed the final or what?
- No, I got a 57.

125
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,570
- Ouch.
- Hello, ladies.

126
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,450
I'm sorry, man.
I mean, that 's gotta suck.

127
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,970
- Just a mild annoyance.
- See? Yeah, there you go, all right?

128
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,810
- If she wants that clown, let her.
- Yeah, for now anyway.

129
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,530
What 's that supposed to mean?

130
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,690
If I'm gonna lose Allison, it 's
not gonna be to a turd like that.

131
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,810
- She likes something about the guy.
- Yeah, obviously.

132
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,570
Come on, Landers!
Wake up out there!

133
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,890
Fancy moves, Crazy Legs.

134
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,690
- In your face.
- God, there he is again.

135
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,450
- How can they take him seriously?
- Just face it, man, you're screwed.

136
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,450
I don't think so. I think I can
take this "Backstreet" bitch.

137
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,050
Nice trick, Landers,
catching the ball with your face.

138
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,090
Next think you know, you'll be
shooting 3 pointers with your ass.

139
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,410
Berke.

140
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,650
Berke, stop! Berke, will you
let me look at it, please?

141
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,890
- Just go back to practice.
- Berke, talk to me.

142
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,810
I just don't understand how you
can replace me with this guy.

143
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,970
Berke, no one can
replace you, you know.

144
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,770
It 's just time to move on.

145
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,610
Is everything just going
great with this striker?

146
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,130
No, it 's just... it 's different,
you know. I mean...

147
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:25,810
He's not like other guys our age.
He's sophisticated and...

148
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,570
We're even gonna try out for
the spring musical together.

149
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,290
You hate theater.

150
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,130
No, I don't.

151
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,810
"Captain of the fairy band,
Helena is close at hand."

152
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,930
- I understand every other word.
- Berke!

153
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,250
- Hi.
- What happened to your face?

154
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,330
- A long story.
- Are you gonna try out for the show?

155
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,090
Kinda. So...
Maybe.

156
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,170
You know, if you're serious about it,
I'm kind of good at that stuff.

157
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,610
Really?

158
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,610
Have you heard her songs?
She's only the next Josie Mitchell.

159
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,290
- "Joni" Mitchell.
- I can actually use some help.

160
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,890
So tomorrow, coffee?

161
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,330
- Okay, coffee will be great.
- Okay.

162
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,930
- Bye.
- Bye.

163
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,210
- "If you're serious, I'm good."
- Shut up!

164
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,850
Did you see Dennis staring
at me again? I told you!

165
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,890
The first thing we need to do is pick
out a monologue for your audition.

166
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,290
Here, this is good.
Lysander, right here.

167
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,850
"She sees not Hermia,
Hermia sleep thou there."

168
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,010
No, wait, you can't run all the words
together. It doesn't work like that.

169
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,850
That 's okay. We'll start from the
beginning. It 's hard to understand...

170
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,690
but once you get into it,
the story's actually kind of good.

171
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,850
So Hermia, this girl here...

172
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,170
she's very rich and beautiful and she
lives with her parents in Athens.

173
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,290
Now Hermia has everything
a girl could ask for:

174
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,370
Cool clothes, nice complexion,
and her pick of any guy she wants.

175
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,770
But of all the guys in
the Greater Athens area...

176
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,490
Hermia's heart belongs to the
handsome young nobleman Lysander.

177
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,650
This would all be perfect if
it weren't for Demetrius.

178
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,450
Hermia's father already
promised her hand to him.

179
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:29,170
He's just as charming and handsome
as Lysander. Maybe even more so.

180
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,290
Not to mention, Demetrius will stop
at nothing to make Hermia his bride.

181
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,450
This pretty much leaves
Lysander screwed.

182
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:43,850
All right, I got it.
You make it very easy.

183
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,650
We just started.

184
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,770
I'm not trying to win the Oscar here,
I'm trying to get my girlfriend back.

185
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,290
Thanks.

186
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,410
Hi, how are you?
Hi, new faces! How are you today?

187
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,770
I'm Dr. Desmond Forrest-Oates,
Fine Arts chair...

188
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,810
and all that hoopla.

189
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,410
The purpose of this proceedings is to
separate the wheat from the chaff.

190
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,490
And I think we might be amazed that
among us is a new glimmering star.

191
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:20,210
Our school's next...
Well, our next Peter Wong.

192
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,130
Hey, Petie, cool shirt.

193
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:31,890
Those who don't make the cut, don't
despair. There's always stage crew.

194
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,690
If you ever had a conversation with
the crew, you know how fun that is.

195
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,650
I'm kidding. I couldn't resist it.
You egg me on. That 's the problem.

196
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,370
All right, the procedure is gonna
be very, very, very basic.

197
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,890
We're gonna start with
the singing audition, okay?

198
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,010
So loose up those
diaphragms, kids.

199
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,370
It 's time to impress.

200
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,450
Where the bee sucks
There suck I

201
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,330
In a cowslip's bell I lie

202
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,170
There I couch
when owls do cry

203
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,730
On the bat's back I do fly

204
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,930
after summer merrily

205
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:13,210
Take a look, here I am
Can't you see?

206
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,930
One simple smile from you
could set me free

207
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:25,530
So if you take a look,
let your heart be your guide

208
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,850
I'll show you love, if you

209
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,650
take a look at the girl inside

210
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,850
- That was fun. Who's the composer?
- Me actually.

211
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:47,690
I'm sorry, were you expecting
applause on that? This is not TRL.

212
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,850
Who's next?
Bentley Scrumfeld...

213
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,690
one of the originals Swing
Town Lads, if I'm not mistaken.

214
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,610
- I see you know your boy groups.
- I follow the popular arts.

215
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,770
- To me, they're so dope.
- If you don't mind...

216
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,330
I'd like to accompany myself.

217
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,170
Put that down.

218
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,250
This one is kind of a
personal favorite of mine.

219
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:27,090
It's so funny to be
seeing you after so long, girl

220
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:33,010
And the way you look I understand
that you are not impressed

221
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,970
But I heard you let that
little friend of mine

222
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,970
take off your party dress

223
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,370
My...

224
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,730
Allison

225
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,770
I know this
world is killing you

226
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,770
Allison

227
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,930
He's the best one.
He's the best one we've seen so far.

228
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,930
My aim is true

229
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,050
Very nice, Mr. Striker!
That is very impressive indeed!

230
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,650
That 's...

231
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,690
- Well, if there's no one else...
- Wait!

232
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,890
- May I help you?
- Berke Landers. I'm here to audition.

233
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,970
Berke Landers. Goodie for me.

234
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,650
I'd like to read a monologue
by Oberon, in the third act.

235
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,650
Well, I can't wait to hear. But first
I need to hear your singing audition.

236
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,930
- Excuse me?
- We sing first and then read later.

237
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,930
Jessica, could you help me here?
I'm sinking in quicksand with this boy.

238
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,530
- Sing first. Read later.
- Sing first. Read later.

239
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,450
- Any song?
- Any song you want.

240
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,890
Kiss a little longer
Make it last a little longer

241
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,690
Projection, Mr. Berke!
Projection.

242
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,730
Kiss a little longer
Stay close a little longer

243
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:49,010
Hold tight a little longer
Longer with Big Red

244
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,770
That Big Red freshness
lasts right through it

245
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,250
Your fresh breath goes on
and on while you chew it

246
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,890
So say goodbye a little longer
Make it last a little longer

247
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,690
Give your breath
one lasting fresh

248
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,570
with Big Red!

249
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:24,210
- What's going on?
- Chester is screwing the rubber tree.

250
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:29,130
- What is that, some expression?
- No, no. My aunt 's dog is with us.

251
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,250
Apparently, he's got some
sort of hormonal imbalance.

252
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,810
- Is Kelly there?
- What?

253
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,290
- Kelly, your sister, is she there?
- Why?

254
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,530
'Cause she did a favor for me today.
Just put her on, okay?

255
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,290
Okay. Hold, please.

256
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,290
Berke Landers. Since when did
my friends start calling you?

257
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,770
Since today.

258
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,930
So how was I?

259
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,490
You were really... okay.

260
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,570
- I thought you knew about the song.
- A minor detail.

261
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,210
- You were cute.
- Wanna tell Allison that?

262
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,410
- I hope you get in the play.
- What?

263
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,810
Felix?
I can hear you breathing!

264
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,570
Hello?

265
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,810
All right, everyone, coming through!
Out of my way!

266
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,250
Part, please. Excuse me.
Thank you.

267
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,410
Okay...

268
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,170
Demetrius!
Congratulations, fair Hermia.

269
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,290
- You're kidding.
- I knew you'd get it.

270
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,290
All right, people,
this place is gonna rock.

271
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,930
Chorus?
You gotta be shitting me.

272
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,850
Helena? My God!

273
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,250
- Good news.
- Sorry. I had my heart set on that.

274
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,010
- That 's good.
- Look, there's you.

275
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,290
Let 's hope attendant number
three doesn't have any solos.

276
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,130
- Felicitations, Miss Woods.
- Thank you so much.

277
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,530
- It 's a lead role.
- I know.

278
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,370
Methinks thou
best not botch it.

279
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,610
I remember what the wonderful
Bobby De Niro once said to me.

280
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,010
Well, not to me,
but I read it in an article.

281
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,570
And it was concerning landing
the big roles. What he said was...

282
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,210
"Just because God blesses you,
does not mean...

283
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,650
there isn't another
sneeze coming."

284
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,690
Anyway, I see you at Thursday's
rehearsal. You too.

285
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,850
Dr. Forrest-Oates, that 's
kind of gonna be a problem.

286
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,850
See, next week, we got
all the basketball playoffs.

287
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,730
Let me tell you
something, bub:

288
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,170
This is your theatrical début!
I want you to take it seriously!

289
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,730
I want you to give it half
the dedication, just half...

290
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,970
that I gave my own!

291
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:15,570
To be or not to be,
that is the question.

292
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,250
Those were the salad days.

293
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,770
Although these are good.

294
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,890
Thursday, none of this.
Jock head.

295
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,850
Let 's go, Jessica. What are you?
Come on, come on.

296
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,130
Excuse me, I'm a teacher.
Thanks.

297
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,810
Let 's go, let 's go.

298
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,570
Where you going, man?

299
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,570
Landers?

300
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,050
So in summation, Lysander loves
Hermia, who loves Lysander...

301
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,690
but is betrothed to Demetrius, who
is the object of Helena's affection.

302
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,450
Now do you see the fun of it?
It 's all hell done break loose.

303
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,010
Mickey Rourke said a wonderful
thing about having fun.

304
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,090
He was at some big soirée that
Liza Minelli was throwing...

305
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,130
Mr. Landers,
how nice of you to join us.

306
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,170
And thanks for not showering.
What a super instinct.

307
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:25,490
The secret to all this, you see,
is that our four young lovers...

308
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,090
are not as in control of their
romantic destinies as they think.

309
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,970
Because in the woods
we have what?

310
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,090
- Fairies.
- Fairies, fairies! Spirits, spirits!

311
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,610
Specifically,
Titania, Oberon and Puck.

312
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,970
- Little Steve.
- "Steven".

313
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:50,050
Who delight in manipulating
the human hearts for sport.

314
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,770
It really is fun to see
a bunch of fairies...

315
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,330
- Little Steve, you've got wings.
- You, guts coming out of your ass.

316
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,010
Come on, guys,
let 's start some trouble.

317
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,450
Fair Hermia, thou art so
incredibly hot and stuff.

318
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:13,770
- Hey, red, follow us.
- You can't see us, but you will obey.

319
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,370
Yo, dude, someone's scamming on
your chick. Time to kick some ass.

320
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,730
Demetrius, what say you?

321
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,810
Relent, sweet Hermia,
and you, Lysander...

322
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,650
...yield thy prized title to my right.
- On guard.

323
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,170
- There's no sword fighting in this play.
- Well, now there is.

324
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,050
Off you go.

325
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,890
When it rains, it pours.

326
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,450
Mr. Landers!

327
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,970
Are we having REM?

328
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,850
Musical Shakespeare,
calling my sister...

329
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,970
- She's helping me out.
- My sister?

330
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,050
- Yeah. She knows what she's doing.
- Whatever. This isn't about her.

331
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,890
This is about you running after
Allison. I'm sorry, it 's bullshit.

332
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,810
See you out there.

333
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,770
That 's it. We gotta find
that boy somebody, quick.

334
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,170
You don't just arbitrarily
replace someone's soul mate.

335
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,050
I mean, look at that old lady from
"Titanic". She never got over that.

336
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:53,330
I'm not just talking about anybody.
You still take shop with Dora Lynn?

337
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,610
Yeah. Last week, she nearly took
out half the class with a nail gun.

338
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,730
So she's a bit clumsy.

339
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:04,210
Thanks to good old Lynn, Bergwell
has to take a crap standing up.

340
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,290
We're not asking her to
build an apartment complex, are we?

341
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:14,570
- Why do you think she's gonna do it?
- Your problem. I take care of Berke.

342
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,330
Dennis heard it firsthand.
The girl's completely into you.

343
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,450
- No, that 's bullshit.
- Why would I make this up?

344
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,850
All right, I'm presenting you
here with a golden opportunity.

345
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,370
The Stanley Cup
of blind dates.

346
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,890
New Zealand's gift to Rosner High.
Those eyes, that mouth, the rack...

347
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,610
Are you forgetting something?

348
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:40,530
- Okay, she's a little accident prone.
- The girl's a walking disaster.

349
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,490
- Where she goes, bad shit happens.
- My God.

350
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,250
I mean, weird
bad shit happens.

351
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:56,730
She missed sixyears of high school.
She was in a coma forChrist's sake.

352
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,210
Berke, she's beautiful,
she's built.

353
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:05,970
She's willing to lower her standards.
I don't see anything wrong with this.

354
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:14,410
- It 's your turn to get the ball.
- I'm not getting it, you get it.

355
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,930
Hey, Dora Lynn. Dora.

356
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,770
- I kind of got this favor to ask.
- Favor, what kind of favor?

357
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,410
Berke, don't be nervous.
I'm here because I want to be.

358
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,250
- Me too.
- We never had a chance to talk.

359
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,170
I think it had a lot to do with the
fact that I was busy with Allison...

360
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,570
...and you had your hands full with...
- Coma thing?

361
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,490
Yeah.

362
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,490
You know, Berke,
it 's all about new beginnings.

363
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,810
That stuff about me being
bad luck, ancient history.

364
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:05,170
I'm moving on with my life,
and you're moving on with yours.

365
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,850
Sorry.

366
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:13,490
Would you excuse me for one minute?
I kind of have to...

367
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,410
Pee?

368
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,410
Waitress, can I have
some more tea?

369
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,010
Tits!

370
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,250
Check, please!

371
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:58,690
I'm dreaming of a boy
A very special guy

372
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,370
I wish that I could pluck
a fairy from the sky

373
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,130
to cast a spell upon
my pride and joy

374
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,050
I'm dreaming of
a very special boy

375
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,850
Time. Time.

376
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,210
It 's just not very good.
I could lie to you...

377
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,330
but I would do you a disservice,
because it 's just bad.

378
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,210
You've got to commit.

379
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:23,370
I'm dreaming of a boy
A very special guy

380
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,610
And then:
I wish that I could pluck

381
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,130
I wanna see you pluck it, you know?
We'll talk about it later.

382
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,690
Enter, Theseus.
Now, attendants...

383
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:37,890
a rogue suitor is spooning
with the master's daughter.

384
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,610
This is totally scandalous.

385
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:43,810
So you must look shocked, amazed.
Let 's see you look shocked.

386
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,570
I said shocked, Mr. Landers,
not constipated.

387
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,370
My dear God. Go, Del.

388
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:57,490
Go bid the huntsmen.
Wake them with their horns!

389
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,930
What can I?
You'd tell me if you'd had a stroke.

390
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,930
- What?
- What?

391
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,210
Are you lost?

392
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,330
No, actually I signed up
for stage crew, and I...

393
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,930
Stage crew?
Then shouldn't you be over there?

394
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,690
Right.

395
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:34,410
My Lord, I shall reply amazedly,
half sleep, half waken.

396
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,610
I came with Hermia hither. Our
intent was to be gone from Athens.

397
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:45,130
Where we might, without the
peril of Athenian law, be wed.

398
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,490
- Save it for show night, Wong.
- Sorry, Striker.

399
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,250
You know what, I'd ask what
the hell you're even doing here!

400
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,530
But if some stranger had dazzled his
way into my ex-girlfriend's fancies...

401
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,490
I probably would do the same thing.
Only I'd have a bigger part.

402
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,570
You dropped your sword.

403
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,490
I am so sorry. Big game.

404
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,730
Substitution.

405
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,450
- Sorry, there was a big accident.
- You're lucky I'm not Bobby Knight.

406
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,850
We got playoffs, and you got
an obligation to the team. Now go!

407
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,650
Yes, sir!

408
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:22,130
Landers, nice ass!

409
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,130
I'm gonna go now.

410
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,130
- I'll see you guys later.
- Have a good night.

411
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,010
Don't stop because of me.

412
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,770
Sorry. I just never get to
play a real piano at home.

413
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,490
So, you've been
a busy guy lately.

414
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,450
Yeah, dating a pyromaniac,
showing my ass in public.

415
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,930
Well, it 's all in the
name of love, right?

416
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,730
Right.

417
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:14,170
- Play me something.
- No.

418
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,210
- Come on, sounded good.
- I'm embarrassed.

419
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,170
I love writing songs,
but it...

420
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,930
- What 's the problem?
- Well, you were at the audition.

421
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,490
Forrest-Oates hated my song.

422
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:34,770
Well, I admired you for putting
yourself out there like that and...

423
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,850
For whatever it 's worth,
I thought it was a really nice song.

424
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,050
Thanks.

425
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,650
This is a song I wrote.

426
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,330
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G
- God!

427
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,850
Go ahead.

428
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,930
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

429
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,610
Show-off.

430
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,930
How do you feel about
half naked women?

431
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:48,210
- Can you tell me where we're going?
- Dennis and I discussed and decided...

432
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,450
that this is exactly
what you need.

433
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,530
It looks like we have a very
special guest with us tonight.

434
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,370
A young man recently jilted
by his long-time ladylove.

435
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,570
See you later, Casanova.

436
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,530
I've got something for you.

437
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:19,570
- What 's that?
- Monday. You know what that means.

438
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,330
Behold my majestic
corselet form!

439
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,090
Police! I wanna see some IDs,
and I wanna see them quick!

440
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,010
- My God!
- Sorry!

441
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,890
Can somebody get me down?

442
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,610
Please! Jesus!
Mother of God!

443
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,290
I must say you
surprised us, Berke.

444
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,690
It 's not everyday a cop says your
son's been pinched in a sex club.

445
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,490
- That said, we've discussed...
- And we'd just like to say...

446
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,330
...we're so incredibly proud of you.
- What?

447
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,050
For getting on with your life.
Most kids your age...

448
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,210
are way ill-equipped to
deal with heartache.

449
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,730
But not you, mister.
You got right back on that horse.

450
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,530
- Or should I say suspension harness?
- Stop!

451
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,690
I just got arrested. Shouldn't
you be like pissed or something?

452
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:31,490
Why? Sexual curiosity
is perfectly natural.

453
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,810
We just had no idea you were kinky.
Hey, who's up for frozen yogurt?

454
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:41,450
Sounds good to me. But Berke may
wanna go home and polish the rocket.

455
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,130
Yogurt is good.

456
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,810
- Okay, Dennis.
- What?

457
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,890
Bring her up.

458
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,890
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing prisoner number 6943.

459
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,010
Bravo, Landers! Bravo!

460
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,130
You know, you do take
a stunning picture.

461
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:15,690
I'd be careful about that accent.
You're sounding like Mary Poppins.

462
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,170
I don't know what you're blathering
about, but if I were you...

463
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,090
- What?
- Are you wearing makeup?

464
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,610
That 's it.

465
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,930
Careful, Landers, I do believe
you're trifling with danger!

466
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,570
Who keeps nunchakus
in their pants?

467
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,250
Peter Wong is down!

468
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:50,610
Look on the bright side, Wong.
You're a singer, not a dancer.

469
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:54,450
I'll kill you, you ass-kissing,
pretentious, swing-town-twit!

470
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:58,290
This is my theater!
My show!

471
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,410
Forrest-Oates is
my special buddy!

472
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:06,530
- That was intense.
- I'd never seen a bone like that.

473
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,610
All right then. Everything is going
to be fine, according to paramedics.

474
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,690
In fact, Peter will be back
on his feet in no time.

475
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:22,570
Still, in the words of the wonderful
Kevin Spacey: The show must go on.

476
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:27,770
Since curtain's in three days, I'm
accepting offers from volunteers...

477
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,450
to the role of Lysander.

478
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,770
Put your hand down,
little Steve!

479
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,930
No, Striker, you
already have a role.

480
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:39,530
Yes, I know. But I was wanting
to nominate someone.

481
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,570
Well, that 's very
flattering indeed...

482
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:48,370
but I don't think a man of 34 can
possibly keep up with you youngsters.

483
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,370
Actually, I was referring
to Berke Landers.

484
00:41:54,130 --> 00:42:00,050
Well, that 's an intriguing thought.
Any other ideas?

485
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,450
One that I might use?
Put your hand down, little Steve!

486
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:07,530
He's green to be sure, but he does
demonstrate a certain enthusiasm.

487
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,410
I'm in.

488
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,770
- You're in?
- Yeah, I'm in.

489
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,650
Jessica, call Domino's.
We'll be here awhile.

490
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:22,210
And keep icing your front bum!
Swelling continues without icing!

491
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:25,970
And I need you!
Not really.

492
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,130
- So how many swords do we have?
- Seven.

493
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,410
- Eight.
- If Allison doesn't appreciate it...

494
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,210
Then what?

495
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:41,330
- I heard your dialog, you're fine.
- Yeah, but what about the singing?

496
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,530
Well, the music sucks,
especially my song.

497
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:49,330
- Why don't you rewrite it?
- Forrest-Oates would never go for it.

498
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:53,370
Kelly, you're the best one in the
play. You know more than he does.

499
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,650
Yeah, but he doesn't
see it that way.

500
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:00,690
Forrest-Oates just cast me as a lead.
He's an idiot, Allison.

501
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:08,650
- My name is Kelly.
- What did I say?

502
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,410
- Allison.
- No, I didn't.

503
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,210
- You did.
- I'm sorry.

504
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,850
- Prepare to die.
- You shouldn't be playing with that.

505
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,810
For... Put it down.
Put it... Kelly...

506
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,650
We have a 18-year-old white male with
a puncture wound to his left arm.

507
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,210
- I'm sorry. I thought it was a prop!
- I wanna see it.

508
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,090
- No, don't look at it!
- It 's pretty bad, isn't it?

509
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,650
No, it 's fine.

510
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,450
Here. Listen to me, Berke,
the doctor is gonna fix your arm.

511
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,730
I'm gonna help you rehearse, and
you're gonna be the best Lysander.

512
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,890
And your arm is really not that...
My God!

513
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:13,330
I'm just saying that Thursday night
you kept Kelly's ass out until 12:15.

514
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,090
Felix, it 's Kelly, all right?
She's helping me out with the part.

515
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:23,370
Just keep an eye on her. Some theater
guys have this reputation of being...

516
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,050
- Gay?
- That 's what they want you to think.

517
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,970
I'll keep an eye on her.

518
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:58,330
- So when your parents leave?
- Tonight. Don't even think about it.

519
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,570
- What?
- I hear your brain planning a party.

520
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,130
No. I'll see you guys later.
I gotta get something.

521
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:10,650
- Why is he going in the music store?
- He's probably buying tap shoes.

522
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,490
Which only further demonstrates
my point, my friend.

523
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,010
That man is in dire
need of a party.

524
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:24,370
- I know you're busy. Just one sec.
- Miss Woods, please, come in.

525
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,010
Fun hair clip.

526
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,250
- I wanna talk to you about my song.
- "A Pocket Full of Dreams."

527
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:37,010
I originally wrote that
tune for Miss Diana Ross.

528
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:42,410
Miss Ross, I've written a very
groovy song! I think you'd!

529
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:44,810
That 's my hand, buddy!

530
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:48,210
Miss Ross, Miss Ross! Diana!

531
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:53,130
Unfortunately, the lawyers
got involved and then...

532
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:56,410
bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit...

533
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,330
and then, the next thing
you know, no deal.

534
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:04,330
- It 's a great song. I love it.
- It was fun to write.

535
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:10,210
I was wondering if you wouldn't
mind if I made a few suggestions.

536
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,650
You made some suggestions?

537
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:17,290
"Weary night,
abate thy hours."

538
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,810
I just figured... You know, like you
said, the song really isn't working.

539
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,930
I'd like you to do me a favor,
if you will, Miss Woods.

540
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:30,370
I'd like you to read this poster and
tell me what it says at the bottom.

541
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:33,170
"No food or drink allowed in
the auditorium at any time..."

542
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:38,050
It says, "12 original songs by
Dr. Desmond Forrest-Oates."

543
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,210
- That part.
- Yes, that part.

544
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,050
It doesn't say, "Additional lyrics
by little miss sassy-pants."

545
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,570
You know, some of those
lyrics are Shakespeare's.

546
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,810
And what was the last tune you
hummed from "Macbeth"?

547
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:59,050
Bill Shakespeare is a wonderful
poet, but Burt Bacharach he ain't.

548
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,570
- Sorry, I'm late.
- It 's okay. I was just getting lucky.

549
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:08,290
- Chester!
- We need to find this dog a date.

550
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:14,410
- So how was Forrest-Oates?
- A bigger asshole than I thought.

551
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,370
- This will make you feel better.
- A gift? Berke.

552
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:23,130
- First we rehearse, okay?
- All right.

553
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:33,010
So that's the girl
that I've got to have

554
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,090
I'll tell you why

555
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:42,770
It 's 21 hours until the play, and
I'm actually starting to suck more.

556
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:47,610
Let 's just put the songs aside for
a sec. We'll work on some dialog.

557
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,690
We're at the point where Theseus
has just woken everybody up.

558
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:52,890
All right.

559
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,290
- Hi.
- Hi.

560
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:09,650
Okay, the scene is between you and
Hermia. So pretend I'm Allison.

561
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:13,730
- Sure.
- As difficult as that might be.

562
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,090
No, go ahead.

563
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:23,450
So Theseus says,
"Go, wake them with their horns."

564
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:28,530
Hermia says, "Methinks I see
things with parted eye...

565
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,090
when everything seems double."

566
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,450
Okay, I got it.

567
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:41,650
My lord, I reply amazedly...

568
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:45,290
half asleep, half waken.

569
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,450
I came with Hermia, hither.

570
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:58,010
Our intent is to leave Athens
where we may be married.

571
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:04,570
And then there's the kiss,
that 's gonna be with Allison.

572
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,490
Right.

573
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:10,370
In this case...

574
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,850
Shit. What?

575
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:24,130
- Let me take a shot. Berke's there?
- Felix, where are you?

576
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:28,610
Big party. Hey, listen, tell
Berke he might wanna stop by.

577
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,890
- Some people are asking about him.
- We gotta go to your house.

578
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:38,090
Well, well, I'm impressed.
Turnout 's not half bad.

579
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:41,690
- Where's Felix?
- Dude, you should really breath, man.

580
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:45,490
- It seems you're gonna stroke out.
- I'm gonna look for him over here.

581
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:47,610
You realize,
I'm going to kill him.

582
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,850
- If it isn't my beauteous co-star.
- Have you seen my brother Felix?

583
00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:01,090
Fair Helena, you're so tense.
A few pre-show jitters, perhaps?

584
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:05,410
Or maybe some love pangs
for a certain you know who?

585
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,890
- You!
- Berke! What 's up, what do you think?

586
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,490
What do I think?
What do I think?

587
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,770
- What are you talking about?
- What do you girls see in this wank?

588
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:20,570
Perhaps you could take me out
to the veranda and... edify me.

589
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,610
Shit, it 's Striker.

590
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:25,730
- Look, I'll see you at the show.
- What the hell's going on?

591
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:29,730
- Nothing. Just a bit of tomfoolery.
- Felix, I'm handling it.

592
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,170
No, you're being handled by leather
pants here. There's a difference.

593
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,850
- I think you better go.
- Come on, I'd fool around on Allison?

594
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:41,290
You know how damnable it would be.
Where's the grub? This way? Thanks.

595
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:55,690
Guys, is it just me or this
punch tastes kind of funky?

596
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,570
There's chunks.

597
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:06,330
Hi. I've been wondering
where you've been.

598
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,490
We have to talk about Striker.

599
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:13,210
No, no. You will stop
at nothing, will you?

600
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,130
Allison!

601
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,010
Striker?

602
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,890
- Allison!
- Maggie.

603
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,770
Allison, I'm so sorry.

604
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:36,290
You can all just go to hell.

605
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:52,850
Hey, you...

606
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:58,450
sorry about this whole party thing.
My brother is kind of an asshole.

607
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,170
Kind of?

608
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:03,450
I'm seriously considering telling
mom where he keeps his porn.

609
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,250
That was a joke.

610
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:13,570
Kelly, why do you
hang out with me?

611
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:20,090
You have better things to do than
waste your time with a hapless loser.

612
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,250
- You're not a loser, Berke.
- Allison thinks so.

613
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:26,530
Allison is an idiot.

614
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:33,410
I have done absolutely
everything for that girl.

615
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,810
She just doesn't get it.

616
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,410
I can't do this.

617
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:21,170
Kelly, I think you're great,
but we can't do this.

618
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:25,130
You're Felix's little sister.

619
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,770
- Screw you.
- Kelly, wait a second.

620
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:34,370
That came out wrong!

621
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:39,490
- What was that?
- It 's not what you're thinking.

622
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,730
What the hell's
gotten into you?

623
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:51,610
Well, well, why am I suddenly
glad we left the conference early?

624
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:57,050
- I don't recall anything about party.
- We could've sprung for a DJ.

625
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,690
Make sure you put the furniture
back when you're done.

626
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:05,930
Judy just took a dump in our pool,
and you wanna spring for a DJ?

627
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:07,930
That 's what makes us so fly.

628
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:10,850
We trust you.

629
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,730
You're my parents for God's sake!
Stop trusting me!

630
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,450
- Judy...
- I'll go get the skimmer.

631
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,490
- Well, this is pretty interesting.
- It was nothing.

632
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,930
Kelly, I was there.
He kissed you.

633
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:46,530
And I don't know why he did it.
He's pretty screwed up right now...

634
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:49,170
Look, I kissed him too.

635
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:56,250
Yes, he is screwed up, and he likes
someone else and it 's a problem.

636
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:59,410
But, Felix, it 's my problem.

637
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:08,970
Look, you know I'd be lying
if I said I was happy about this.

638
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:18,010
But if Berke can't see what
an amazing person you are...

639
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,010
then I'd say that he's
the one with the problem.

640
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:27,290
Good night.

641
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:57,090
Hey, it's me, it's Berke. I just
wanted to thank for all your help.

642
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,490
The guy at the music store said that
songwriters use these things, so...

643
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:05,850
If anyone can fix Forrest-Oates'
song, it's definitely you.

644
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:10,530
Just know that I
believe in you, Kelly.

645
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,010
Break a leg.

646
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:56,890
Hey, let 's mess with the
mortals one more time.

647
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:00,090
Boyfriend will
be tripping on this.

648
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:05,210
- One more dose for Mr. Morose.
- Time for a little wake-up call...

649
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:08,250
and I'm out of here.

650
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:15,450
And in the woods,
where the scents are sweet...

651
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:18,610
there my Lysander
and myself shall meet.

652
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,890
Maybe it 's time you started
dreaming of someone else.

653
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:35,610
Berke, you were my first.
No one's ever gonna replace you.

654
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:38,930
I've dazzled my way into
your ex-girlfriend's fancies.

655
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:42,090
You were the quintessential
high school couple.

656
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:44,890
She's not your girlfriend
anymore, man!

657
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:49,650
I'm moving on with my life,
and you're moving on with yours.

658
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,250
- Are we freaking you out?
- Yeah, we're freaking him out.

659
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:07,850
- The costumes just arrived.
- Thank Buda.

660
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:12,890
And your wife called. She might not
make it to tonight 's performance.

661
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:17,010
- Did she say why?
- It was difficult to understand.

662
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:22,090
And, sir, there is
one more thing!

663
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:25,290
Del Molden Junior is sick.

664
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:30,450
- My dance partner? Shit!
- That 's enough of you, muck mouth!

665
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:35,770
He got some tainted fruit punch last
night, and won't be able to perform.

666
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:40,610
Not that it matters. The entire
production's going down in flames.

667
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:48,890
I'm curious if anyone feels they can
fill the little boozehound's place.

668
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,730
Good. Let me ask you this...

669
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:56,450
Is there anyone who, at all,
is good on their feet?

670
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:01,730
A shuffle or a turn or an attitude
of any kind. With a pose.

671
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:06,490
Well, sometimes, coach
Hibble calls me Crazy Legs.

672
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:08,250
Does he?

673
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:17,250
Wait a second. Maybe if you took
a half step back before the spin.

674
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:19,250
Okay, just follow my lead.

675
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:22,810
I learned this from
watching in the wings.

676
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:29,970
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- I am, I'm in makeup.

677
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:33,290
Listen, I need you to
do a favor for me.

678
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:42,930
Ladies and gentlemen, please sit.
The performance is about to begin.

679
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:48,290
It 's over. After this one,
I'll be directing on the streets.

680
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:04,890
Hey, break a leg.

681
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:12,890
Raise the curtain on the tragedy that 's
befallen the Bard's greatest comedy.

682
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:14,930
- I'm praying foryou, sir.
- Thanks.

683
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:27,810
Did you ever read
a Shakespeare play

684
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:31,970
and never understand
a word they say?

685
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:37,970
Tonight, we're gonna make things
clear, 'cause Shakespeare's dead

686
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:41,050
But we are here

687
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:48,850
William Shakespeare wrote
a play a long, long time ago

688
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:53,930
about this chick named Hermia
and the two guys who loved her so

689
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:57,010
They said,
"Hermia, please, be my girl"

690
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,490
But she only wanted one

691
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:04,570
In the night, the fairies came to
play, that's night we have our fun

692
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:08,010
- 'Cause I love him
- And I love her

693
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,650
If only her best
friend he'd prefer

694
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:13,570
And so the fairies all
hatched a scheme

695
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:18,050
in this "Midsummer
Night's Dream"

696
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,650
"Midsummer Night's Dream"

697
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:23,530
"Midsummer Night's Dream"

698
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:41,290
- Look, there's Helena.
- Fair Helena.

699
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:45,210
Call you me fair?
That fair again unsay.

700
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,690
Doesn't Kelly
look beautiful?

701
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:51,050
Demetrius and Lysander
love you, fair Hermia.

702
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,130
Happy fair.

703
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:02,330
- Do it
- Yeah, baby

704
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:03,970
Do it

705
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,970
It's fun to be a fairy
and fly from town to town

706
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:15,530
Our fairy dusty will keep you up
You won't come down

707
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:18,890
It's fun to be a fairy and
wear such pretty things

708
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:22,450
It's fun to carry love
juice on your fairy wings

709
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:25,850
What fools these mortals have been

710
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:29,250
They try to make love
and make a comedy

711
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:35,850
Why can't these mortals learn
a fairy up above will never burn?

712
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,210
- It's fun to be a fairy
- That's right

713
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:41,530
- It's fun to be a fairy
- That's right

714
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,890
It's fun to be a fairy

715
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:49,330
- It's fun to be a fairy
- Give it up, give it up

716
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:51,530
It's fun to be a fairy

717
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,570
It's fairy power!

718
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,690
That was...
That was okay.

719
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,850
Relent, sweet Hermia.

720
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:12,250
And, Lysander, yield that
crazed title to my certain right.

721
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:18,330
You have her father's love,
Demetrius. Let me have Hermia's.

722
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,410
Do you marry him?

723
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:24,930
Shit box. Dick weed.

724
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,210
It 's so real, you can
almost feel the tension.

725
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,810
Word.

726
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:33,370
Why won't you love me?

727
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:42,450
- There's a girl
- Who says she don't love me

728
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:46,650
- So that's the girl
- That I got to have

729
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:51,130
- I'll tell you why
- She's everything a girl ought to be

730
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:55,890
- And that is why
- I can't understand why not me

731
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:01,010
- Hermia
- I'll make you love me

732
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:05,370
Hermia, I'll make you care

733
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:09,570
Never before has
a girl loved me more

734
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:12,570
I'm begging, Hermia

735
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:16,570
Please, love me

736
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,330
- Bitch.
- Pansy.

737
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:21,690
- Please, love me
- Asshole.

738
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:39,330
I'll apply to your eye
gentle lover's remedy.

739
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:43,530
And when thou wakes,
thou will tak'st true delight...

740
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:46,210
in the sight of thy
true lover's eye.

741
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,770
Okay, people,
we're back in 20.

742
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:58,490
Berke, I wanna talk to you about
something. Can we go somewhere?

743
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,010
Well...

744
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,330
I can use a drink.

745
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:16,570
- You're not equipped to deal with this.
- We're talking an 800 number.

746
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:20,090
- I called them once for advice.
- Really?

747
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,770
Yeah, I had zits
on my balls.

748
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:26,970
They're gone now.

749
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:31,090
Gentlemen,
I'm here for a favor.

750
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:36,330
In act 4, scene 1,
there's a particular effects cue.

751
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:41,370
- The volk tube crescendo.
- Right. Now, is this the one?

752
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:44,650
No. That one could
take out a village.

753
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:47,730
I see.

754
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:53,810
Well, I was wondering if you might
be able to detonate it a bit early?

755
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:58,290
- Isn't it before Mr. Landers cross?
- Look, all it will do is scare him.

756
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:00,770
I can signal you by raising
my sword, like this.

757
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,690
About this whole thing with Striker.
I'm sorry, I didn't believe you.

758
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:10,650
I'm sorry you had to find out
liked that. It kind of sucked.

759
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:15,570
Look, I know I don't deserve to
ask you anything right now, but...

760
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:18,010
if I can just have one wish...

761
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:24,250
it would be that we could go back
to the way things were, you know?

762
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:29,450
- I mean, the friends part.
- Yeah, sure.

763
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:32,890
And as for the
rest of it, well...

764
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:42,770
we'll just leave
it up to fate.

765
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:53,530
Did I mention there was
US$ 47 in it for you?

766
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:56,130
Not bad.

767
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:01,530
I believe, Mr. Scrumfeld,
we have an understanding.

768
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:06,010
Remember, gentlemen:
When I raise my sword.

769
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:14,210
Hey, the music's been good.

770
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:17,330
But you know that song
"A Pocket Full of Dreams"?

771
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:21,730
- Down here we call it "full of ass".
- That 's it. There's been a change.

772
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:27,450
This is different.

773
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:39,530
A spell's been cast,
the lovers sleep.

774
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:45,930
Though in repose, fair Helena's
love for Demetrius grows.

775
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:54,130
Weary night,
abate thy hours...

776
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:59,690
steal me awhile from
my own company.

777
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:11,770
Let me sleep
For when I sleep

778
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:15,850
I dream that you are here

779
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,170
You're mine

780
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:23,730
And all my fears are left behind

781
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:27,650
I float on air

782
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:34,690
The nightingale sings
gentle lullabies

783
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:39,770
So let me close my eyes

784
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:42,610
Jessica! Jessica!

785
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:46,890
And sleep
perchance to dream

786
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:53,130
So I can see the face
I long to touch

787
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,130
to kiss

788
01:08:56,610 --> 01:09:01,010
But only dreams
can bring me this

789
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:05,450
So let the moon

790
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:12,290
shine softly on the
boy I long to see

791
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:17,410
And maybe when he dreams

792
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:22,610
he'll dream of me

793
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:33,610
I lie beneath the clouds

794
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:38,970
and whisperto
the evening stars

795
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:45,450
They tell me love is
just a dream away

796
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:48,570
A dream away

797
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:53,090
A dream away

798
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:13,210
So let the moon

799
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:19,930
shine softly on the
boy I long to see

800
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:25,610
And maybe when he dreams

801
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:30,410
he'll dream of me

802
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:41,050
Dream of me

803
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:06,610
Go bid the huntsmen.
Wake them with their horns.

804
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:16,330
My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
half sleep, half waken.

805
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:20,010
I came with Hermia hither. Our
intent was to be gone from Athens...

806
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:23,370
so we might without the peril
of Athenian law be wed.

807
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:29,050
- However...
- What?

808
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:31,930
"However"?

809
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:37,930
My lord...

810
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:40,770
we slept and slept...

811
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:44,090
as well you know.
Things do change...

812
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:46,250
as love did grow.

813
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:54,370
Although, in ways fair Hermia's soul
and mine shall forever intertwine...

814
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:58,330
alas, we must forever part.

815
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:02,010
For Io to another...

816
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:04,610
belongs this heart.

817
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:28,650
Wait a second, wait a second!
You can't do that!

818
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:32,410
You can't just change
400-year-old literature!

819
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:35,010
It 's not even
supposed to rime!

820
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:38,650
Fine. I can do it too.

821
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:44,450
I do not like in the boat, I do not
like it in the car. How's that?

822
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,410
Stop cheering!

823
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:52,810
Stop cheering!

824
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:54,330
Stop cheering!

825
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:55,890
Do it. Now!

826
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:11,290
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

827
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:27,130
What 's that?

828
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,130
It 's applause, sir.

829
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:40,890
Thank you. Thank you.

830
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:43,970
Thank you!

831
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:04,570
- My God, are you crying?
- No, you're squeezing my wound.

832
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:15,090
Make it a little
more like this.

833
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:19,770
- You were trying to fly into my seat?
- No.

834
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:22,130
- Come on.
- Well, maybe just a little.

835
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:25,530
You see? I knew it.
You're so bad. I love it.

836
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:29,810
Just hold on one second.

837
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:32,570
I'll be right back, okay?

838
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:38,370
So, you and my sister, huh?

839
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:43,330
- You're not gonna hit me again.
- No, but I'm not thrilled, all right?

840
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:47,010
But if it has to
be somebody...

841
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,090
...I'm kinda glad it 's you.
- Thanks.

842
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:55,410
- Hey, Kel.
- Hey.

843
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:58,570
- Good job. You guys were good, funny.
- Thanks.

844
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:02,330
- Listen, I'm... I gotta go.
- You and Dora Lynn?

845
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:08,090
- Aren't you kind of worried about?
- Accident prone? No, no.

846
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:11,250
I think Dora Lynn is about
to have a change of luck.

847
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:13,850
Go, Felix.
I'll see you guys later.

848
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:17,010
- All right. Let 's go get dim sum.
- Bye, Berke.

849
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:23,130
That 's okay. That 's fine.

850
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:27,450
He blew off that stage
2O feet at least.

851
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:32,890
And then she took off like this
beautiful spaceship into the night.

852
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:43,930
- We burnt the shit out of his face.
- Tomorrow night, same thing.

853
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:51,210
So my theatrical début,
what did you think?

854
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:55,370
- You were strong in the last act.
- Yeah, I was good.

855
01:15:56,730 --> 01:16:00,810
- We gotta do it again tomorrow night.
- How do you think it 's gonna end?

856
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:05,970
We could bring back the
always popular Big Red song.

857
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:10,490
- I'd rather be shot with an arrow.
- I thought it was a prop.

858
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:12,410
Yeah, yeah.
