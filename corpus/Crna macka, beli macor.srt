1
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,600
Who's dealing, you or me?

2
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,520
Me.

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,240
One card for you...

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,360
...one card for me.

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,560
Three for you, one for me.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,040
Four for me, one for you.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,880
Five for me.

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
Rotten hand.

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,960
You're playing funny.

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,560
You don't want...? Don't get mad.

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,720
I was only asking.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,440
How many cards do you want?
Three?

13
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,320
Are you going to give me a break?

14
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,080
I have a bad hand.

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,520
Wait till you see what I'm going to do.
Moron.

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,360
This will be my victory.

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,960
Daddy.

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,760
Did you see how brilliant...?

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,800
Show your hand...
Don't get mad.

20
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,320
You, don't interrupt me...

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,200
...or you'll be sorry.

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,480
When I get married,
buy me a truck like that.

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,040
I take two.
And you? None? Great.

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,200
Two for me.

25
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,760
Lovely hand. Three Aces.
-Swanker.

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,120
Promise, when I get married.

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
Four Sevens.

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,080
Look, how lovely.

29
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,680
Screw your "lovely".

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,240
Daddy, look.

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
I told you, don't interrupt
when I'm playing cards.

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
Daddy likes you,
but you're troubling him.

33
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,080
Cards are like whores.

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,840
Fickle.

35
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,160
Who do you think I am?

36
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,280
I can bluff.

37
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,880
Maxim Gorki is here. The Russians.

38
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,840
Look at this. Poker.

39
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,200
Maradona.

40
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,440
Hurry up, Zare.
-Give my eggs back.

41
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,520
How much for the horns, comrade?

42
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
Ten marks.

43
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,960
Come on, five marks.

44
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,680
No way. Ten.

45
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,280
What do you want with it?
-Silence. Simpleton.

46
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,440
It is secondhand raw material.
One for five marks.

47
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,120
One million horns, five million marks.

48
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,720
Sure.

49
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,560
How much for the washing machine?
-300 marks.

50
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Fine machine. Very good.

51
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,560
I'll make you an excellent offer.

52
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,160
220 marks for the horns,
the washing machine and the computer.

53
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,960
No way. 280.
-250.

54
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,200
Sold.
-Shake hands.

55
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,240
Can I help?
-It's all right.

56
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,720
On that side.

57
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,480
Daddy.

58
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,440
We've been swindled.

59
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,960
Have a look.

60
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,720
The Russians trade water for Diesel.

61
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,400
What?

62
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,480
Water. Have a look.

63
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,360
100 percent Diesel.

64
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,240
Water.
-The barrel is full of water.

65
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,600
The whole barrel?

66
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:07,240
The cold rain falls at dawn.

67
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,960
I don't understand.

68
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,320
Why is she wearing spy-glasses
and a grater?

69
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,600
Some small change
for the baby she's expecting.

70
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,080
For the surgery.

71
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,760
Grandma expresses her gratitude.

72
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,880
-What?
It will be two, according to the echo.

73
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,880
Piss off, bloody gipsy.

74
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,160
The gate, the gate.

75
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,760
Halt, who goes there?

76
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,360
Hello.
-Who are you?

77
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,800
Matko Destanov.
-Hands up.

78
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,960
Hands up.

79
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,560
Goose, over.

80
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,520
I was planning to
go to Hungary tonight.

81
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,320
To the fair in Pecs.

82
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,040
Go to the fair wherever you like,
but don't return without a fiancée.

83
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,040
Understood?

84
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,880
Hello, mister Grga, boss.

85
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,360
Little bird, why have you returned?

86
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,760
I've never been here.

87
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,120
Yes you have, five years ago.
-Me? No.

88
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,480
Don't contradict me.
-We saw each other, but not here.

89
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,240
Someone important relocates often.

90
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,760
Eight years ago then.
-Eight? That's impossible.

91
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,080
O yes, yes.

92
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,280
My compliments, uncle Grga.

93
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,240
Look at me.
-I am looking at you.

94
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,480
Why are you here? And don't tell lies.

95
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,720
I would do anything for your father.

96
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,400
He saved my life twice.

97
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,560
In Genova, and in Marseille.
-I know.

98
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,600
He beat up half the city...

99
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,840
...to get me out of jail.

100
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,400
He is a gentlemen.

101
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,560
Was. May the Lord have mercy on his soul.

102
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,960
On whose soul?
-My father's. Last year.

103
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,360
One day I was doing all right, the
next day I was an orphan.

104
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,160
Without any help.

105
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,840
Lost and lonely.

106
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,040
No one can help me.

107
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,200
You were his downfall.
A swindler, a rotter, gambler, vagabond.

108
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,560
That was temporary.

109
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,480
Making mistakes is human. I have changed.

110
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,360
I've learned my lesson.

111
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,760
Uncle Grga, I've got a brilliant plan.

112
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,280
What kinda plan?
-A train.

113
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,960
A train with 20 wagon-loads of gasoline.

114
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,480
Gasoline?
What use is that going to be to me?

115
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,640
Since the death of my father...

116
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,400
...I don't get anybodies help.

117
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,680
That's business for the pros.

118
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,240
They'll screw you.
You're a freshman.

119
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,040
No, Uncle Grga. I've got it all
covered this time. It'll be all right.

120
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,720
I've got it on paper.

121
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,240
I'll show you the fax.

122
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,280
Don't come back without a wife.

123
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,480
Are you up to something again?

124
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,640
Laugh, dammit.

125
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,680
I received an urgent fax.
Everything's in there.

126
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,560
All the details.

127
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,960
Birdy.

128
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,360
Come here.

129
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,600
Goose, over... Reply.

130
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,040
Look, uncle Grga.

131
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,640
Everything's in the fax.

132
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,040
We invest 70.000 marks...

133
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,360
What, boss?

134
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,680
Goose, the laborers can go.
And you too.

135
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,640
All right, boss.

136
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,320
Let's have a break.

137
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,120
I want to loan 70.000 and within a
week I'll return you 100.000.

138
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Did you see that?

139
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,360
I see it, uncle Grga.

140
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,960
You sure have a lot of money.

141
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,200
I'm only doing this for your father.

142
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,360
You won't have to pay me back...

143
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,480
...but I do want a full report
of your lucrative deal.

144
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,800
If not I'll send my grandsons
to skin you alive.

145
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,160
Am I making myself clear?
-Very clear.

146
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,840
Weirdo.
-Millions. Maradona.

147
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,720
You said your granddad died.

148
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,760
He's in a hospital,
that's practically the same.

149
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,040
He has a large cement factory
and never gave me a penny.

150
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,280
Zare, my son. With this money
your daddy will buy you a future...

151
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,640
...and your children's future.

152
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,760
Leave me be.
I'll never forgive you.

153
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,080
Zare.

154
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,720
Take a look at this miracle.

155
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,640
Now that's what I call an invention.

156
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,960
Only the Germans can
invent something like that.

157
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,760
Daddy makes a promise to you...

158
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,960
Boy, when I'm rich,
I'll make a ship-owner out of you.

159
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,360
Dadi.

160
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,480
There's our benefactor.

161
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,880
Pitbull.
Terrier.

162
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,720
Fortune favors the bold.

163
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,960
Ungrateful bastard. I give you something to
eat and that's your way of saying thank you?

164
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,800
It's all in the game.

165
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,360
Welcome, Dadi, my dear brother.
-Who is he?

166
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,160
What the fuck do you care?
-I was only asking.

167
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,480
So there's a God after all.

168
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,040
Is there anything to see?

169
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,680
Unlucky person. Read this.

170
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,920
You wanted to see me.

171
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,440
I don't wanna work with thieves anymore.

172
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,920
What are you waiting for?
Give the man something to drink.

173
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,000
I've got a cunning plan.
-You?

174
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,480
Honderd percent failsafe.

175
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
It's the plan of the century.

176
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,280
I've got a connection in Jordan.

177
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,640
He sells me a train full of gasoline.

178
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,960
Brilliant. A stroke of luck.
-Well just buy it.

179
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,360
I don't have the money.

180
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,840
That's why I need you.
You know the custom-house officers.

181
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,120
You don't need to know the
custom-house officers.

182
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,760
The Bulgarians always say: "Brother, if you
can't solve a problem with money...

183
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,680
...solve it with a lot of money."

184
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,360
Have a drink.

185
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,920
What is it?

186
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,640
Whisky in a gin-glass?

187
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,800
You don't like gypsies?
Get lost, bitch.

188
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,400
Get lost all of you.

189
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,840
Fuck you all. You too, out.
You choose her side.

190
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,040
No.
-He's lying.

191
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,000
Forget it.
-Piss off.

192
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,200
Suckers.

193
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,080
I'm not a racist.

194
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,720
Huh, Matko?
-You have always been tolerant.

195
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,760
I've known you since you were little.
-Sorry.

196
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,920
I'll drink from the bottle.

197
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,520
No way. Cheers.

198
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,840
On our deal.

199
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,400
Ain't he cute?

200
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,760
He's old enough to get married.

201
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,400
Zare? He's not of age, but he is mature.

202
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,520
Is he honest?
-One hunderd percent. That's what counts.

203
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,000
Lucky you. You live like a man.

204
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,880
Not like me, with that scum.

205
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,280
Motherfucking junkies.
Don't you dare that again.

206
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,640
Stop whining.
Apparently you're not short on anything.

207
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,680
What's that to me? Tell me.

208
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,040
I've got it made.

209
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,440
I have a big house, a castle.

210
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,720
2500 square meters.

211
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,520
Daddy's mausoleum.
No-one in this land has one like it.

212
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,480
Ain't it beautiful?
-Very much so.

213
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,400
Why are you crying, Dadi?

214
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,360
Don't cry.
-Why not?

215
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,360
Why shouldn't I cry?
-It's a wonderful house.

216
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,720
It's a shame. A shame.
-How come?

217
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,360
I've fulfilled all of daddy's wishes.
Except one:

218
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,080
Nobody wants to marry my sister.

219
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,240
It's a disgrace.

220
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,280
Don't you worry, my brother.
All will be well.

221
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,600
We'll make this deal
and drink on it.

222
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,760
Cheers.

223
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,960
Hello, Aksim?

224
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm in trouble, help me.
I've heard you've got a singer.

225
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,040
She can work miracles.

226
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,600
Go serve the customer.

227
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,800
Wait till he comes in.
-Go water the pole.

228
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,120
What's her name? Medusa?

229
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,240
Damn, disconnected again.
The devil's playing with that phone.

230
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,680
The line got disconnected again.

231
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,240
I told you: it's the devil.

232
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,120
Damn it. Go water the telephone pole.
I can't do business this way.

233
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,240
She's getting on my nerves.

234
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,320
Hey you. Come here.

235
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,720
Who? Me?

236
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,440
Stop acting funny, you're not waiting for
anyone. You're following me all the time.

237
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,760
I only want a lemonade.

238
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,200
Of course.

239
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,680
Go water the pole.
Hurry up. Grab a bucket.

240
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,800
Go water the pole.

241
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,720
What a jerk.

242
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,640
Pour.

243
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,560
I don't hear you... I don't hear anything.

244
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Pour.

245
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,880
Now I can hear you.
Loud and clear.

246
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,600
Send that singer with the fast train.

247
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,480
She begins tomorrow.

248
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,480
And my lemonade?

249
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,680
You'll get that when
when the goose grow a beard.

250
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,640
Music.

251
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,360
My dear grandson.

252
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,520
I brought you some clothes.

253
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,840
What does the doc say?

254
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,360
That I'll live to become 100,
if they leave me alone.

255
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,960
And your liver?
-Completely gone to pot.

256
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,480
You shouldn't drink anymore.

257
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,800
What? I will drink.

258
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,960
I will drink if I feel like it.

259
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,000
This is a hospital.
Music isn't allowed here.

260
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,720
Doctor, you've got to make
an end to this.

261
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,120
Imagine what it would be like if
all patients brought an orchestra.

262
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,360
You don't have the right to be so cross.

263
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,320
It's a matter of respect.

264
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,000
What a wonderful life.

265
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,520
Excellent booze. I'm on fire.

266
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,360
Grandson, I've got to tell you something.

267
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,680
You don't have a mother,
your father is no good.

268
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,200
I sold the cement factory.

269
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,080
Up in smoke. I sold it to
that crook, Dadan.

270
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,760
I took the money.
For your future.

271
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,840
If you need money,
go to my friend...

272
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,200
...whom I haven't seen in 25 years.
His name is...

273
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,920
I know. Grga Pitic.
-You know him?

274
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,440
You've told me about your friendship
a thousand times.

275
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,400
A seven feet giant with
hands like shovels.

276
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,320
He's got two rows of teeth.

277
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,160
One gold, the other normal.

278
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,400
Elegant as a vampire.

279
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,920
Music... aggression.

280
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,320
Shoot me.

281
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,760
Here's a flowerpot.
Leave me alone, Apin.

282
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,560
I'll tell you something, old man.
I despise death.

283
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,880
"Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship."

284
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,720
Boss, try to taste the difference.

285
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,600
Our whisky is better than the real thing.

286
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,920
Logical. Our technology is better.

287
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Where are you, children?
-We're here, grandpa.

288
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,680
Sit down.

289
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,200
That's enough, children.

290
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,280
You, what have you've been up to?
-You know, I was looking for a wife.

291
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,160
He's been to 28 fairs.
-And did he find a wife?

292
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,200
Answer him, jackass.

293
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,080
There are enough women for fun and
making out, but not to marry.

294
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,080
Why? All your friends are married
and have children.

295
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,640
When I was your age I had
been married four times.

296
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,760
The sister?

297
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,080
Find a girl and get it over with.

298
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,640
Don't get excited. What was number five
like? The one that stole your heart?

299
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,440
Tell me.

300
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,640
My darling.

301
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,160
Only the memory of her was
enough to lighten my heart.

302
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,200
My darling...

303
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,880
That's family.

304
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,960
As soon as you saw her, you knew
she was the one. That's what I want too.

305
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,920
When will that be?
When I'm dead?

306
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,640
Why don't you be a good boy and
marry for him.

307
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,240
Yesterday I had another attack.
I can barely see.

308
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,000
Again?
-Again.

309
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:12,000
I beg you for the last time:
find yourself a wife.

310
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,440
Take me to the hospital
to recover.

311
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,120
I'll get out for your marriage.

312
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,520
Bring me a daughter in law.

313
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,760
Ok, grandad.

314
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,280
Kssss, cat.

315
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,840
Black cats are bad luck.

316
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,280
Mincha, brother.

317
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,640
Take care of the passenger train,
I'll take the goods train.

318
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,360
There's the train.

319
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,920
One...

320
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,760
...two, three...

321
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,840
...five...

322
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,720
...six...

323
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,160
...nineteen...

324
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,360
...and twenty.

325
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,920
All's well.

326
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,160
This calls for a celebration.

327
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,640
I was scared shitless to be screwed.

328
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,080
The train is here, as promised.

329
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,320
The money is here too, as promised.
You got what you asked for.

330
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,560
I was anxious when the train
crossed the border.

331
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,280
Is all going ahead of schedule?
-You made a promise.

332
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,320
Cheers.

333
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Why are you hiding?

334
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,360
Dammit, I call the shots around here.

335
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,600
Stop, young man.

336
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,040
That suitcase is mine.

337
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,200
But I gave everybody their share.

338
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,600
Where's the rest?

339
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,000
It's all, I swear on the Bible.

340
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
There must be a misunderstanding.

341
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,840
You black soul!

342
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,840
I should finish you.
-No.

343
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,920
Shame on you.

344
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,080
Here's the little birdy.
He's sleeping.

345
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,240
My suitcase.

346
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,480
Give back my suitcase, thief.

347
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,800
I spit on your dead.

348
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,520
Get down, you pig.

349
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,400
I want my suitcase back.

350
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,520
I'll climb up there.

351
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,480
The moment has arrived
for you and me...

352
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,800
...to look each other in the eye.

353
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,400
Just you and me.

354
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,480
Bloody son of a bitch.

355
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,040
I'm here.

356
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,040
Man, this is way too high.

357
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,760
Dadan, brother.

358
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,280
Dadan, It's me. Matko.

359
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,240
The train is not here.
-What?

360
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,960
Did he cross the border?

361
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,200
Answer me. Where are my 17 tankers
I paid for?

362
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,200
It crossed the border 30 minutes ago.
It's here somewhere.

363
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,160
Here? Where?
You don't lose track of a train.

364
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,760
Somebody drugged me.
I was asleep for only 10 minutes.

365
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,640
-Who done it?

366
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,160
He did.

367
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,760
It was him.
-That pig?

368
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,840
My Bulgarian custom officers
didn't see no train.

369
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,200
They're lying. They're double crossing,
but they will have to pay.

370
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,640
A train rides on track,
not just through the woods.

371
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,440
It can't just have gone up in smoke,
or can it? Boss?

372
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,560
No way, dammit.

373
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,120
My dear public...

374
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,000
After a triumphant tour in
North-Africa, Asia and Australia...

375
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:41,560
...I'm proud to present to you:
Medusa.

376
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,480
An act, never seen before:

377
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,360
...to pull a nail from a beam
in the most spectacular fashion.

378
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,400
It wasn't an ordinary fight,
but more one man against King Kong.

379
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,120
Who was the man?
-Me.

380
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,880
It wasn't an ordinary Bulgarian.

381
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,640
That jerk could only pass the
doorway sideways.

382
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,280
Name?
-Rambo.

383
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,920
A warm welcome for this
young man named Rambo.

384
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,480
Please hold your breaths,
my honored guests...

385
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,360
The great, unforgettable,
breathtaking moment is near.

386
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,000
It will be burned into your memory.

387
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,120
I proposed an honest fight.

388
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,040
But he kicked me in the balls.

389
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,960
I grabbed him by the hair and whirled
his head around. He gets angry.

390
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,760
I had to save my skin after all,
didn't I?

391
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,680
You'll return my money tonight at
11 o'clock.

392
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,920
Otherwise I'll hang you by the balls
on the windmill.

393
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,160
So you can learn to be an astronaut.

394
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,520
Jerk.

395
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,120
Don't you have the money?

396
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,760
I'm in trouble.

397
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,840
Three tankers were mine.
I invested all I got.

398
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,760
I've got a cunning plan.
There's a different solution.

399
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,800
Yesterday I bought your father's factory
in the hospital.

400
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,280
The cement factory?
-I paid it.

401
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,600
You can always ask.

402
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,600
But it's not enough to cover your debt.
It's only two thirds.

403
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,160
I've got a better idea.

404
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,720
You have a marriageable son.
And I've got a marriageable sister.

405
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,360
We arrange a marriage
and forget your debt.

406
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,120
I'll give you anything you want, Dadi.
But that's impossible. -Why?

407
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,360
I'll bet the nail.

408
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,080
Name?

409
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Don't lose your soul.
How can you propose something like that?

410
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,040
Your sister is 25, my son 17.

411
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,640
Younger men like ripe women.

412
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,800
And that's not all, Dadi.

413
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,800
What else?
-You know, you know.

414
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,200
She looks like a little Smurf.
Everyone calls her little Lady-bird.

415
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,680
So what? A diamond is small,
but valuable.

416
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,240
Wanna bet? Doesn't matter what.

417
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,640
Hands off.

418
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,920
Let's toast on the deal.

419
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,920
No. I've got it figured now.

420
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,280
I know who stole my train
and drugged me.

421
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,360
And who messed with my father
and stole my heritage.

422
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,400
Safet. Kazatchok.

423
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,680
I know who cheated my father.

424
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,440
Last chance.

425
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,240
The moment of truth.

426
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,080
Kiss my ass.

427
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,200
Attention.

428
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,280
One, two, three... freedom.

429
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,880
What are you doing?

430
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,320
Is this seat taken?

431
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,240
What do you want?
-Lemonade.

432
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,320
Hey you.
-Me?

433
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,160
Get an ice-cream.

434
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,760
I'm not an errand-boy.

435
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,680
You're always following me around,
might as well make yourself useful.

436
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,040
Don't you think so?
-Exactly.

437
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,760
Out of the way.

438
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,600
Strawberry or vanilla?

439
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,440
Strawberry and vanilla. Four servings.

440
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,920
Where are you going?

441
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,760
Are you in a hurry?

442
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,240
I've got to tell you something.

443
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:01,000
Where did you go to?
-Finish my lemonade.

444
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,200
Shame you're getting married.

445
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,560
I just thought: he's young, but handsome.

446
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,400
I'm falling in love.

447
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,160
And now you're getting married.

448
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,440
Married? Who's getting married?

449
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,320
I'm only thinking about you.

450
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,000
I'm always here for you.

451
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,840
It's over. Don't make a fuss.

452
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,440
That's a lie.
Someone's setting me up.

453
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,120
Don't lie to me. I'm too young,
I don't want to marry.

454
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,960
Prepare yourself to get engaged.

455
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:45,040
I overheard your father and Dadan
in my grandma's inn.

456
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,440
They agreed last night.

457
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,160
It's a shame. Here.

458
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,400
Dadan stole the factory.
That son of a bitch.

459
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:54,320
And now he wants me too.
You know how many people he cheated.

460
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,520
He got the train, the factory...
What else does he want?

461
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,360
What else?

462
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,560
His mother's pussy.

463
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,760
The Russians are here.

464
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,920
The water is nice.

465
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,200
He wants something else...

466
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,600
...that Dadan.

467
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:22,280
He wants to arrange a marriage
to pay of my debt.

468
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,440
A marriage? For whom?

469
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,320
For our child Zare and his sister.

470
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,560
The Lady-bird.

471
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,320
That bawler, the midget?

472
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,520
She's barely three feet tall.

473
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:44,440
Now I have to ask the help
of my friend Grga Pitic.

474
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,240
You're coming with me.
-It's too late.

475
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,800
Grga Pitic... is dead.

476
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,000
Dead?

477
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,160
God have mercy on his soul.
I haven't had a drink yet...

478
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,320
...but I'll have one now
for his salvation.

479
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,080
Grandfather.

480
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,720
There's my grandson.

481
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,000
Ain't he handsome?

482
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,400
I'll introduce you.

483
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,400
Hello, nurse.

484
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,080
Have you seen her?
-Who?

485
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,840
The girl.

486
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,800
No.

487
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,680
The nurse.

488
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,360
They call her Candy.

489
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,040
Those boobies, that body.

490
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,880
And that tiny butt. All so delicate.

491
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:29,000
I want love at first sight,
or nothing at all.

492
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,840
Love at first sight? Ridiculous.

493
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,080
The son of your deceased friend Zarija
dropped by.

494
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,920
He came for help.

495
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,240
All his money is being stolen.

496
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,800
I've got a score to settle with
those villains, with Little Grga.

497
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,840
We'll skin them like cats
and eat them alive.

498
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,720
I'm coming with you.
I want to see the grave of Zarija.

499
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,760
As you will, grandad.

500
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,640
It was only a proposition.

501
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,840
Nobody listens to me.
I'm talking to you.

502
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,120
I'm not getting married this way.
-Shame on you.

503
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,640
Miss, please.

504
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,160
You're my greatest enemy.

505
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,760
You're no brother to me.

506
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,720
You're a butcher.

507
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,600
Must our parents
curse me from their grave?

508
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,440
I don't want to marry.

509
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,400
I'm not getting married. Do you hear me?

510
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:31,360
If my true love appears,
I'll marry him.

511
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,440
Waist, 68.
-Who is it?

512
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,440
Tell me. Who is it?

513
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,960
I'll know when I see him.

514
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,760
I saw him a hundred times in my dreams.
I know what he looks like.

515
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I know his eyes,
his face, his lips.

516
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,640
He's tall, very tall...

517
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,760
Which tall man would want you,
stupid goose?

518
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,040
You're barely over three feet.

519
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,120
One day he'll come.

520
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,600
Breast, 88.
-Silence. Leave me alone.

521
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,120
Safet.

522
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,880
Cool down.

523
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,920
When will you let me find peace
in my own home?

524
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,040
Let me go.
I'll marry the man I love.

525
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,880
Pull.

526
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,320
Little sister... what can I do?

527
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,440
Daddy's looking at you, little sister.

528
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,080
Are you convinced?

529
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,600
I'll turn you into a fountain.

530
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,400
Fuck you... Go on.

531
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,040
I'll marry the man I love.

532
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,960
What about your soul?
-Our parents are watching from above.

533
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,640
They can't see anything, it's clouded.

534
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,960
Hands up in the air.

535
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,600
Dadan. You're doing fine.

536
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,480
Move over, let the lady sit.

537
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,920
Congratulations.

538
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,840
Do you want something to drink?
-Coffee.

539
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,160
Only coffee?
-Only coffee.

540
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,360
Can I help you?

541
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:29,040
Ask Matko, that dumb ass.

542
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,080
Take care of the kitchen,
I fear the worst.

543
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:39,880
The one who looks like a vampire
and the fat one are married.

544
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,000
So only the little one is left.

545
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,240
They call her Little Lady-bird
or Smurf.

546
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,960
That midget?

547
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,200
Yes, in her bridal gown.

548
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,040
Good luck.

549
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,760
Never.

550
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,360
I'm here for business.

551
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,840
What business, Sujka?

552
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,480
You marry my Ida.

553
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,800
I see she pleases you.

554
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,360
My Ida.

555
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:12,560
You'll won't find a prettier girl
in the whole region.

556
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:18,320
I fed her from her birth.

557
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,360
We've been everywhere.

558
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,920
In spas
to make her beautiful.

559
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,120
To buy her Italian clothes...

560
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:33,040
...we went to Rome and Napels.
-Liar.

561
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,840
I showed her all countries.

562
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,160
In the end we went to Sweden.

563
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,760
I know. To beg.

564
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,680
At least we didn't scavenge the trash
like you did.

565
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,120
How much do you ask?

566
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,920
Give me 35.000 marks.

567
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,160
Grandma.

568
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,440
15.000 up front and 15.000 after.

569
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,440
For such a tip even I won't marry.

570
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,200
17.000 in three parts?
-At once.

571
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,040
And I don't want see you ever again.

572
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,440
Your Grandma's selling you like a cow.

573
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,120
Never.

574
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,200
Carry me.

575
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,280
Come on, carry me.

576
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,760
You're a weirdo.

577
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,120
And now...kiss me.

578
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,040
Damn tie.

579
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,400
Save me, grandpa. Don't let me be married.

580
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,040
I'll drink his blood.

581
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,600
Take it easy.

582
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,040
Give me that gun. Calm down.

583
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,040
The gun.
-I'll finish him.

584
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,800
You should be ashamed of yourself.

585
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,440
Give me that gun.

586
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,640
Relax. Keep cool.

587
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,480
I'll teach him.

588
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,760
I know what I have to do.

589
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,000
I don't want to.
-Listen.

590
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,640
I was nearly dead. Listen.

591
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,520
Her brother Dadan
is a war criminal.

592
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,600
He'll exterminate our family.

593
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,320
He'll drink our blood.
-But she's a midget.

594
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,920
O mirror, the dead with the dead...

595
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,920
....the living with the living,
the children with their father.

596
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,800
For two months.
Then you get a divorce.

597
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,320
...the dead with the dead...

598
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,360
I don't want to marry.

599
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,600
I won't.

600
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,720
I'll prevent the marriage in an
elegant manner.

601
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,240
Zare.

602
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,000
You'll get punished.

603
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,280
You'll fulfill your draft
in the zoo.

604
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,680
I'll fuck your ratface.

605
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,720
Where is he?

606
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,680
Who?
-Your grandson.

607
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,560
Go ahead, play. Great.

608
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:45,480
Where is he?
Should Dadan slaughter us all?

609
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,840
Where is my son?
-I don't know. Couldn't care less.

610
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,360
Where is he?
-I don't know.

611
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,960
Get out of there.

612
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,200
You shouldn't hide your shoe.

613
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,680
You should be ashamed of yourself.

614
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,920
It's a disgrace.

615
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:30,520
the dead with the dead,
the living with the living...

616
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,480
Granddad.

617
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,520
He doesn't breathe anymore.

618
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,720
Grandpa is dead.

619
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,280
Come.

620
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,680
He is dead.

621
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,040
Come, grandpa is dead.

622
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,200
His heart stopped beating.

623
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,200
Dead?

624
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,320
Do you die on the day your
grandson marries?

625
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,200
The day he marries...

626
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:06,720
Grandpa saved me. He saved me.

627
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,040
We'll flee together after the
period of mourning.

628
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:16,040
You'll need a costume, shoes,
a butterfly-tie...

629
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,920
Wreaths of flowers, candles...

630
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,720
Definitively dead.

631
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,360
Ah it's you, Matko, you womanizer.

632
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,920
You're early. Eight o'clock, you said.

633
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,200
Where's the son in law?

634
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,760
I've got something to tell you.

635
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,080
It's urgent.
I've got to talk to you in private.

636
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,320
Today I only want to hear good news.

637
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,160
I'm listening.

638
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,480
My father is dead.

639
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,880
Really?
-Yes.

640
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,680
My condolences.
-What can I do?

641
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:36,960
A marriage and a funeral don't
get along well.

642
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,480
He can die in three days.

643
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,480
But he died this morning.

644
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,800
Who says so? Who knows?

645
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,680
I know. Zare...

646
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,080
I told you straight away.
We'll have to mourn for forty days.

647
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,320
I'll mourn with you... in three days.

648
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,560
You're a wise man.

649
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,200
You didn't stop the preparations?

650
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,280
Sure I did.

651
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:14,000
Should my father turn in his grave?

652
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,800
Of course not.

653
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,920
Don't tell anyone about the old man.

654
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,800
It doesn't matter to him if he dies on
Wednesday or Friday.

655
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,320
Death's forever.

656
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,760
It doesn't matter when it begins.

657
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,960
You didn't hear anything.
-Nope.

658
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,880
We didn't hear anything.
-No.

659
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,320
Me neither.

660
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,000
Wait for the guests
and get the bride.

661
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,040
As you like, Dadi.
-Cheers.

662
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,480
He doesn't want to hear it.
-What?

663
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:01,200
Even if he kills us and places us dead at
the dinner table, the wedding will continue!

664
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,760
I don't want to.

665
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,200
Does he have to rip my head off?

666
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,240
Take this.

667
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,280
For your soul, daddy.

668
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,120
Take his legs. We are going to the attic.

669
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,760
Turn him aside.

670
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,520
Get ice downstairs.

671
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,720
Hurry up!

672
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,040
Quick!

673
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:54,280
Don't do this to me.
You don't need money anymore.

674
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,160
Put his legs on the chair.

675
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,160
Get the grandchildren of Grga Pitic here!

676
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,680
I left six messages.
They don't answer.

677
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,120
Who knows where they are?

678
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,360
Daddy, forgive me.

679
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,080
Hold it above the bride.

680
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,880
Hold it above her head.
-I don't want to.

681
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,800
Get away you.

682
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,760
Take the child, it will bring you luck.

683
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,560
This is the most beautiful day...

684
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,280
....of your whole life.

685
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,120
A unique day...

686
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,360
....to say so.

687
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:30,680
The day of your life.

688
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,960
Answer now in front of the witnesses...

689
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,160
....the following questions.

690
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,360
Be brief. And without hesitation.

691
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,320
Just yes or no.

692
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,480
Do you...

693
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,320
Zare Destanov do you...

694
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,200
....out of free will...

695
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,680
.... take Afrodita Karambolis to be your wife?

696
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,720
Karambolo.

697
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,640
Yes.

698
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,360
Yes.

699
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,720
And you, Afrodita...

700
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,560
....lovely beauty and so sweet...

701
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:33,720
....do you take Zare Destanov to
be your husband out of free will?

702
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,280
She says she wants to.

703
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,200
Let her tell. Yes or no.

704
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,720
I want an answer.
-Yes.

705
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,480
So yes it is.

706
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,840
I don't see any legal objection.

707
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,760
I now declare you man and wife...

708
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,120
....in my presence...

709
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,720
....and in the presence of this crowd.

710
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,520
See if the food is ready.

711
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,200
I don't want to.

712
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,760
You know my hand can be very swift.

713
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,360
Thunder in one hand,
lightning in the other.

714
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,520
Please sign this.

715
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,520
I cannot serve on his wedding.

716
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,440
Why do you care about his wedding??

717
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:28,160
On behave of the people of Sarduk...

718
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,120
....I declare married:

719
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,680
Zare Destanov and Afrodita Karambolis.

720
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,880
Do you cry for him?
-Yes.

721
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,480
Then cry.

722
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,520
Cry, baby, cry.

723
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:51,440
I will buy you a convertible
and half the ocean!

724
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:54,160
and three houses
bigger than America

725
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,840
Little girl,
you have stolen my heart

726
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,920
and if you were mine,
you would live like a queen,

727
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,360
at daytime a queen
and at nighttime an empress.

728
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,800
Cheers, Dadi.

729
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,960
A real businessman and patriot.

730
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,680
Come and dance, little sister.

731
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,560
I can't.

732
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,760
Untie her.

733
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,360
Respect your brother in law, a sensible man.

734
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,840
Dance with your brother, it's tradition.

735
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,840
I don't want to.

736
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,600
Fine. It's your wedding.

737
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,680
Freedom.

738
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,440
Daddy, I hope you see this.

739
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,800
Let's see who has spent the most.

740
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,160
A portable record player...

741
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:53,200
....from Nada Adzovic.

742
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,320
Zudija Adzovic donates
a vacuum cleaner.

743
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,400
Spaho Ahmetovic, pots and pans.

744
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,360
It's ok, friend.

745
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,240
I am going to look how daddy is doing.

746
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:25,480
Stay here and please don't get us in trouble.

747
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,920
Nebojsa Palanovic
donates this ugly thing.

748
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,880
Don't show the people you are crying.

749
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,680
Don't get us in trouble.

750
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:06,400
I am a
pitbull-terrier.

751
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,480
I am going to give new ice to daddy.

752
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,000
You live poorly.

753
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,280
Repair your roof.

754
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,600
There is nothing wrong with the roof.

755
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,320
It's daddy who needs to be repaired.

756
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,400
Don't cry.

757
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:04,200
Do you want to marry someone you don't love?

758
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,720
No.

759
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,720
Neither do I.

760
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,400
Do you love her?
-Yes.

761
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,880
Help me run away.

762
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,520
What?
-Help me escape.

763
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,640
There is a big shutter near the table...

764
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,840
....two meter two the left.

765
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:42,000
It leads to the oil-barrels.

766
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:27,040
Can you be somewhere better?

767
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:36,440
For once be honest with me, daddy.

768
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,560
Where is your money from the factory sale?

769
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,800
Safet.

770
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,880
The grenades.

771
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,080
Grenades?

772
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:51,120
Where is the bride?
-Ask the businessman and patriot.

773
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,800
Everybody listen.

774
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,600
The bride has fled.

775
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,360
Chief, the bride has fled.

776
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,320
Chief, your sister is gone.

777
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,120
My sister.

778
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,360
Zare.

779
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,520
My sister...

780
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,640
Stop it.

781
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,920
Don't worry.

782
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,720
Your brother will not abandon you.

783
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,480
I will find the guilty one.

784
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,760
How could she remove her dress and escape?

785
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,640
You let your wife escape.

786
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,760
What have you done, stupid fool?

787
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,720
What have you done?

788
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,320
Has your sister escaped?
-No, yours.

789
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,880
Then why the fuck are crying? Get fucking lost.

790
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,160
Stupid junkies.

791
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:59,080
What are you doing here?

792
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,920
Searching for Smurfette.

793
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,320
How did you call her?

794
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:06,400
Smurfette.

795
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,000
Shame on you.

796
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,240
You don't call my sister Smurfette.

797
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,160
Eat shit.

798
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,000
Don't you know who I am?

799
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,920
Fuck you.

800
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,800
It's not her fault, she doesn't know anything.

801
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,520
She does know something.

802
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:29,160
Stop it. Everybody calls her
ladybird or Smurfette.

803
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,800
Grandfather.

804
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,640
Grandfather? You are unrealistic, boy.

805
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,400
Grandfather.

806
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,240
Release him.

807
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,880
Don't bother your grandfather, he is dead.

808
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,400
Leave him, he doesn't know anything.

809
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,160
Where is she?
-My ear.

810
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,000
Let go of him, bastard.

811
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:03,560
Where is she? She hasn't vaporized.

812
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,800
Tell me , suckers. Or I will kill you.

813
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:16,200
Don't turn around. Look at me.

814
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,560
Shall I shoot?
-Later.

815
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,960
Dadi.

816
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:47,320
What are you doing here?
-Dadi, I am stuck.

817
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:55,640
I have important news.

818
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,520
My balls are stuck.

819
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,680
Shame on you. Repair that roof.

820
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,880
Forget that. I have seen the bride.

821
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,920
Where?
-She is going to the wood.

822
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,880
Safet.

823
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,880
Not there, friend. Further away.

824
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:31,000
The bride went that way.

825
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:46,000
I love her.

826
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:49,760
I am going to marry her.

827
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,160
Granddad, do you hear me?

828
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,480
Yes, what's the matter?

829
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,880
We can still turn back.

830
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:01,080
I will arrange it with Little Grga.

831
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,960
Visit his grave another time.

832
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,320
No, now.
Who knows how long I will stay alive.

833
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:10,720
Yes, but it's 39°c in the shadow.

834
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,880
It will last.

835
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:16,560
Zarija deserves to see me.

836
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,080
Ok then.

837
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:22,120
I said it for your own good.

838
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,800
Afrodita.

839
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,120
Sister.

840
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,560
I will not harm you.

841
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,440
There she is.

842
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,160
My sister.

843
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:04,600
All ends well.

844
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,920
She is not here.

845
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:33,880
Maybe she is in the woods.

846
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,680
What a shame the bride runs
away from her own wedding.

847
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:44,480
Everybody will talk about it for years.

848
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,080
Nonsense.

849
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:49,680
I will find her. The wedding will continue.

850
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,480
Chief, it's a shoe.

851
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,160
Sister.

852
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,160
I will kill you.

853
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,880
Wake up, we are free.

854
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:25,360
Wake up. An earthquake.

855
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:33,120
Little Grga, if I listen to you
I will get lost.

856
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,960
That map is a hundred years old.

857
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,760
Little Grga, do you hear me?

858
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:42,920
Where did you find that atlas?

859
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,240
Are you asleep?

860
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,600
I am in trouble.

861
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,240
That's destiny.

862
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,480
Why destiny?

863
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:32,640
All this. I will still marry you.

864
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,280
Yes.

865
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:38,280
Who could have thought Ladybird
would be so brave?

866
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:41,800
Nobody ever revolted against Dadan...

867
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,960
...except her.

868
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,160
I am afraid.

869
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:55,240
Why? We will manage fine.

870
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:05,840
Congratulations, son. brilliant idea.

871
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,960
I thought it was my imagination.

872
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,320
But it's destiny.

873
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,760
And my other shoe?

874
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,320
We will find it.
But this is one hundred percent destiny!

875
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:07,120
Exactly.

876
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:12,840
I was looking for my other half.

877
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,520
Me too.

878
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:18,640
I looked and looked, and will find
her when I least expect it.

879
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,280
Me too.

880
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:27,040
Let's introduce ourselves. I am Grga.

881
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,720
Me too. I mean, I am
Afrodita Karambolo. Ladybird.

882
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,600
We must celebrate,
if you agree.

883
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,080
My sister...
-Quiet.

884
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:47,480
It's a misunderstanding.

885
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,120
Why do you shoot like that?

886
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:00,120
And you, girl, you are in trouble.

887
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:02,040
You will pay.

888
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:05,640
If the girl has any debts
I will pay them.

889
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:18,480
What are you looking at? Do something.

890
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:26,880
Grga.

891
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,600
Give me back my sister.

892
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:32,640
Stop or I will shoot you.

893
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,800
Fuck off. Come here, sis.

894
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:38,600
What's wrong with you, idiot?

895
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:42,800
And your grandfather? And your brother?
You were losing us.

896
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,320
Look what I have got.

897
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,360
Don't come any closer
or I will pump you full of lead!

898
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,040
I swear to God. This is serious.

899
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,560
Sister in law...

900
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,560
Who are they?
-Put your guns down.

901
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,120
Stop.

902
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,360
She is my sister. Understand?

903
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,160
I don't know you.

904
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:08,960
But I do know her.
-And I know him.

905
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,040
Continue your path.
My path leads to her

906
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:18,760
If you are really her brother,
we can come to an agreement.

907
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:21,880
I want to marry her immediately.

908
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,800
She just ran away from her wedding.

909
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:31,800
You can run away from a fake marriage,
but you can't hide from destiny.

910
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,880
What a sniper.

911
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:44,440
Where did that asshole come from?

912
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:47,440
Put down your guns.

913
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:52,600
You call this driving, idiot?

914
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,640
You took the wrong road.

915
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,920
Ok, but look what I found.

916
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,400
Very good.

917
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,440
Take it easy.

918
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,560
This isn't necessary.

919
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:21,320
How's it going, Consignor Grga?

920
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:23,440
Is it you, worthless piece of shit?

921
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:25,640
What are you doing here?

922
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:28,080
We were just talking.

923
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:30,240
Talking about what?

924
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,960
Are you here to pay off your debt?

925
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,960
Do you know each other?

926
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:42,040
My last resort in Italy, in 1982.

927
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,080
He was a student in my brigade.

928
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:47,200
The worst kind.

929
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:51,880
Because of him I lost ground.

930
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,880
I live nearby.

931
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,760
Don't you want to marry her?
-No.

932
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,800
I want her.

933
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,360
We shall see.

934
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,720
Now.
-Be silent when you are speaking to me.

935
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,520
And you, do you want my grandson?

936
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:47,080
Yes.

937
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:59,240
And you do not object to your
sister marrying my grandson?

938
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:02,560
Of course not, if they love each other.

939
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,680
Why do you look so sad?

940
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:08,640
What's wrong?

941
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:11,520
Ah yes, he needs to go to the factory...

942
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:17,160
...and pay back the three
tankers of gasoline.

943
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,440
Do you know how much that is?

944
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:22,600
He will pay at once.
-Of course.

945
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:25,960
And the wedding must
start immediately.

946
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:31,000
The wedding can begin.
Music. It's my treat.

947
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,960
What counts, is that love conquers all.

948
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:43,080
Cheers.

949
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:46,880
Has he drank yet?
-Not yet.

950
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,800
My beautiful sisters.
-I hope there won't be any complications.

951
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,880
You will swim in your own shit.

952
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,960
Do you need anything, uncle Grga?

953
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:08,840
Have fun, I am going visit
the grave of my friend.

954
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,480
The grave?

955
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:13,720
Where is it? Tell me.
-Uncle Grga...

956
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:19,880
Don't you want to drink something first?

957
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:22,240
A refreshment. Eat something as well.

958
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:26,440
At this hour there are
vampires in the graveyard.

959
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:30,160
Once we are there,
it's already day again.

960
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,880
Whatever.

961
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:35,960
My servants will bring
you to the graveyard.

962
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:43,360
But to which graveyard?

963
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:55,120
Give me the money.

964
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,280
Traitor.

965
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:59,880
It was only ethical.

966
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:06,160
You must have fun. Eat and drink.

967
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:09,400
Your sister is happy, so is my son.

968
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:12,720
Like our benefactor, uncle...

969
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,280
Dammit.

970
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,080
What's the matter?
-Look.

971
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:36,280
What's the matter with him?

972
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:40,600
He is dead.

973
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,720
Really dead.

974
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:53,880
No. He will die the day after tomorrow,
like your father.

975
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:58,840
The wedding must continue. I can't
start over a hundred times.

976
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:01,320
Am I right?
-Completely.

977
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:04,120
Shall we put him in the attic?

978
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:16,080
We told his grandchildren,
we brought him to the graveyard.

979
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:20,200
What about the official?
-Which official?

980
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:24,600
He must cancel the first wedding
and perform the second wedding.

981
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:28,200
Don'worry,
I will get him.

982
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:32,640
Ok. We are doing well

983
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,800
Goddammit...
-Eat your shit.

984
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:11,440
Two sixes.

985
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:17,600
There you go.

986
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,560
How sweet.

987
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:28,840
The more natural , the sweeter.

988
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:40,000
Fifty marks.

989
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:18,160
Look, Dadan...

990
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:22,760
500 horns at 5 marks is 2500 marks.

991
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,880
In Düsseldorf it's wanted.

992
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:30,360
Are you crazy?
Do you want to stuff those horns?

993
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:33,280
Wait, Dadan.

994
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,800
Be a gentleman.

995
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,520
My stake is the factory.

996
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:45,440
You have lost that one already.
Look, you have signed this.

997
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:48,240
Ok, I still have a house.

998
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:51,840
You have lost that one too, idiot.

999
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:57,000
But you do have...

1000
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:01,240
...a nice golden tooth.

1001
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:06,400
That will be the stake. 500 marks, ok?

1002
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:21,480
What's with the ice?

1003
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:26,320
Get lost.
-What's the matter?

1004
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,280
Damned black cat.

1005
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:36,640
I am soaked. She has pissed on me.

1006
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,200
Brother.

1007
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:43,240
Where are we? Aren't we dead?
-We are.

1008
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:46,960
I know I am not dead.
-They told me you were dead.

1009
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:48,960
It's not true.

1010
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:52,360
They have lied to you.
I am alive.

1011
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:04,000
Daddy. I am glad you are alive.

1012
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:06,040
Goddammit.

1013
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:09,320
The cow is dead, the milk is finished.

1014
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:12,120
Granddad.

1015
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:16,160
Your father is alive.

1016
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:24,920
I will notify you
of the agreements...

1017
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:27,960
...of holy matrimony...

1018
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:31,600
...and the responsibility of marriage.

1019
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:34,960
I wish you a happy life.

1020
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,320
May it last a life long...

1021
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,160
...and enjoy each others company.

1022
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:47,640
You should consider...

1023
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:53,080
... fulfilling one of the most important
and beautiful tasks in life.

1024
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:04,760
Be jealous, not with each other,
but on your marriage.

1025
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,440
Honor it and protect it
against all evil.

1026
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,200
Consider it...

1027
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:19,000
When you died,
I decided to leave.

1028
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:21,200
What has fallen?

1029
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:25,720
Very wise. There is no sun here.

1030
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:29,560
Forget your glasses. Hurry up.

1031
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,400
Agreed?

1032
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:33,760
I am having a difficult time.

1033
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,880
I have been drinking
on the funeral, just now.

1034
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:39,160
Don't forget the accordion.

1035
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:43,600
In it you will find enough,
to become happy

1036
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:49,080
Oh no. The death certificate
instead of the wedding certificate.

1037
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:51,000
Are you crazy? Junkie.

1038
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:53,080
My reputation...

1039
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:56,480
Shall I call the police?

1040
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,360
Here.

1041
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:00,600
Everything is all right.

1042
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:04,480
The signatures.
First the ladies, then the men.

1043
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:08,120
The ladies don't marry each
other, stupid fool.

1044
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:10,160
Don't make a fuss.

1045
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,440
It must happen according to the law.

1046
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:19,680
Do you, Afrodita Karambolo...

1047
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,920
....take to be your husband...

1048
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:23,720
....Grga Pitic junior?

1049
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:25,280
Yes.

1050
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:31,360
Do you, Grga Pitic junior...

1051
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:34,760
....take to be your wife
Afrodita Karambolo?

1052
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,320
Yes.

1053
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:41,840
Sign the register.

1054
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:45,560
According to the law you
are now husband and wife.

1055
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:49,000
Wait, it's not finished yet.

1056
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:13,720
Get me out of this mess. Come back.

1057
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:16,800
I can't work in that manner.

1058
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:23,280
There it is.

1059
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,040
It's amazing.

1060
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:26,600
Quickly!

1061
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:30,760
We are not married yet.
-We will do it on the way.

1062
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:43,280
Mr. Dadan, you're in trouble.

1063
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:49,720
You always spoil everything.
We must continue the ceremony.

1064
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:51,280
What a mess.

1065
01:56:56,840 --> 01:57:00,280
I can't work like that.
-Yes you can.

1066
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:02,520
It must be according to the rules.

1067
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:05,840
Don't shoot.
-Shut up.

1068
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:13,040
We are missing the boat.

1069
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:17,760
The boy has guts.
-He is right.

1070
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:20,280
Zare, my grandson.

1071
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:27,160
You are young, you don't understand.

1072
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:30,000
What do you want from me?
-I want you to marry us.

1073
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,040
Don't forget the accordion.

1074
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:49,760
Finish the ceremony.

1075
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:54,760
Sit down.

1076
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,120
You don't have any witnesses.
-Yes we do.

1077
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:00,640
Who?
-The cats.

1078
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,360
You dirty pig.

1079
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:14,320
You smell, boss.
-Fuck you.

1080
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:33,200
Yes.

1081
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:36,840
Do you, Zare Destanov, take her
to be your wife...

1082
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:38,400
Of course.

1083
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,160
Children...

1084
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:45,000
Have a good journey.

1085
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:54,440
Shall we drink to it
like it is tradition?

1086
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:21,440
Grandmother.

1087
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,640
You have fooled me, daddy.

1088
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:45,280
You stupid asshole.

1089
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:54,160
It's disgusting.

1090
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,160
Nice stuff.

1091
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:08,240
Thanks, daddy,
for everything you have done for me.

1092
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:11,160
My soul is on fire.

1093
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,320
Ah, children...

1094
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:37,600
Dadan, brother.

1095
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:44,360
"Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship."
