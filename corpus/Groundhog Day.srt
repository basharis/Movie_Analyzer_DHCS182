1
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:56,892
<i>Somebody asked me:</i>

2
00:00:57,142 --> 00:01:00,396
<i>"Phil, if you could be anywhere,
where would you be?"</i>

3
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:03,190
I said to him,
"Probably right here...

4
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,527
...Elko, Nevada."
Our nation's high at 79 today.

5
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:09,446
In California, they'll have
warm weather tomorrow...

6
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:12,324
...gang wars and some
overpriced real estate.

7
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:15,411
In the Pacific Northwest,
they'll have some...

8
00:01:15,703 --> 00:01:17,329
...very, very tall trees.

9
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,124
Clear across the Rockies
and Great Plains.

10
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:22,793
But look out, here comes trouble.

11
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:26,005
Oh, boy!

12
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:28,382
Front coming our way!
Look out!

13
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:32,428
What will that mean to us?
One of these big, blue things!

14
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:36,557
This cold, frigid arctic air,
this big mass out of the north.

15
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:40,769
It'll meet up with all this
moisture out of the Gulf.

16
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,397
They'll mix at high altitudes
and cause snow.

17
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:49,111
It won't hit us here in Pittsburgh.
It'll push off and hit Altoona.

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,404
Close call!

19
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:52,323
Let's look at the five-day.

20
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,951
As you can see, nothing to be
too scared about.

21
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:59,913
Bundle up warm, but you can
leave your galoshes at home.

22
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:02,875
I won't be here at 10:00.
Tomorrow's Groundhog Day.

23
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:07,630
I'll be in Punxsutawney for our
country's oldest groundhog festival.

24
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,091
According to the legend,
tomorrow, February 2nd...

25
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:14,094
...if the groundhog wakes
and sees his shadow...

26
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:16,430
...we've got six more weeks
of winter.

27
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:17,765
Sounds like fun.

28
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:21,560
You must really enjoy it.
This is your third year in a row.

29
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,062
Four, Nan.

30
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:24,271
Four.

31
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:25,689
Thanks, Phil.

32
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:30,611
Next, our entertainment editor
looks at sex and violence in movies.

33
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:31,946
Stay with us.

34
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:36,075
We're clear.

35
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:38,202
Have fun in Punxsutawney.

36
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:44,208
For your information, Hairdo,
a major network is interested in me.

37
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,086
That would be the
Home Shopping Network.

38
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:51,131
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.

39
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:54,218
That was nice, Phil.
" Big trees"!

40
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:55,344
Stop, Kenny.

41
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:58,222
Look, can you handle
the 10:00 or not?

42
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:02,601
If you don't want to rush back,
I can do the 5:00 tomorrow.

43
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,813
Stay an extra second in Punxsutawney?
Please!

44
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:08,274
Rita thinks it'd be
a great idea...

45
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:11,902
...to stay for other events.
You'll get incredible footage.

46
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:14,488
The people and the fun.
The excitement!

47
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:17,908
You haven't worked with her yet.
She's really nice.

48
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:21,287
I think she'll be
a really good producer.

49
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:23,956
You guys are going to have fun.

50
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,421
She's fun. But not my kind of fun.
I'll be here for the 5:00.

51
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:34,526
Can you keep a secret, Larry?

52
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:37,237
I'm probably leaving PBH.

53
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:40,324
So this will be the last time...

54
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:42,159
...we do the Groundhog together.

55
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:45,663
What's wrong with
the Groundhog Festival?

56
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:46,997
In San Diego...

57
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:50,918
...I covered the swallows returning
to Capistrano for six years.

58
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:55,756
Someone will see me interview
a groundhog, think I have no future.

59
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:58,050
I think it's a nice story.

60
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,095
He comes out.
He looks around.

61
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:03,055
He wrinkles up his nose.

62
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:07,101
He sees his shadow or not.
It's nice! People like it!

63
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:09,728
You are new, aren't you?

64
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:12,606
People like blood sausage too.

65
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,358
People are morons!

66
00:05:14,984 --> 00:05:16,610
Nice attitude.

67
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,198
Look in the mirror and see how you
look when you do that groundhog thing.

68
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:22,616
For me? Once?

69
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:26,620
He comes out, and there he
looks at his little shadow.

70
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:29,915
Want some blood sausage?
I have some...

71
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:32,042
I like blood sausage.

72
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,853
Rita, I can't stay here.

73
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:35,648
Prima donna.

74
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:38,108
- What's the matter?
- I hate this place.

75
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:40,986
I stayed here two years ago.
I was miserable.

76
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:43,822
- I won't stay here.
- You're not staying here.

77
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:45,199
I'm not?

78
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,451
Larry's dropping me off.

79
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,245
I booked you in
a nice bed-and-breakfast.

80
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,456
Great.

81
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:56,877
I think this is one of the traits
of a good producer.

82
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:58,837
Keep the talent happy.

83
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:00,547
Anything I can do.

84
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:03,342
Would you help me
with my pelvic tilt?

85
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:08,889
Within reason. Want to come
to dinner with Larry and me?

86
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,309
No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.

87
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:17,439
You get your sleep.
See you in the morning.

88
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:19,692
Don't be late.

89
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:24,488
Did he actually call himself
"the talent"?

90
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:56,228
<i>Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.</i>

91
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,273
<i>- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day!</i>

92
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:01,775
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

93
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:04,820
<i>Expect hazardous travel
later today with...</i>

94
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,488
<i>... that blizzard thing.</i>

95
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:09,867
<i>That blizzard thing.
Here's the report.</i>

96
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:14,455
<i>The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing.</i>

97
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:17,458
<i>There's another reason
today's especially ex citing...</i>

98
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,418
<i>Especially cold.</i>

99
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:22,087
<i>The big question
on everybody's lips...</i>

100
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:25,007
<i>- Their chapped lips.
- On their chapped lips.</i>

101
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:27,843
<i>Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?</i>

102
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:31,388
<i>- Punxsutawney Phil!
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

103
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,057
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

104
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:36,352
<i>Get up and chuck me a hog!</i>

105
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:41,565
- Morning!
- Morning.

106
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:43,901
- Off to see the groundhog?
- I am.

107
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:46,195
Think it'll be an early spring?

108
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:48,489
I'm predicting March 21 st.

109
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,950
Good guess!

110
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:54,828
I think that actually is
the first day of spring.

111
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:06,090
- Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
- I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.

112
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:08,592
Like some coffee?

113
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:13,305
Is there any possibility of getting
an espresso or cappuccino?

114
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:15,516
I really don't know...

115
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:19,353
How to spell espresso or cappuccino.
This looks fine.

116
00:09:19,603 --> 00:09:21,772
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

117
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:25,276
- I'm sure I will.
- There's talk of a blizzard.

118
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:29,029
We may catch a break and
it will blow right by.

119
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,448
The moisture coming
out of the south...

120
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,909
...by midday will
push on to the east.

121
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:39,123
At high altitudes it'll crystallize
and give us what we call snow.

122
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:43,127
Our high will get to
about 30 today, teens tonight.

123
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:47,089
Chance of precipitation,
about 20% today, 20% tomorrow.

124
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,342
Did you want to talk about
the weather or just chitchat?

125
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,303
Chitchat.

126
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:54,096
See you later.

127
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,560
Will you be checking out today?

128
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:02,104
Chance of departure today, 100%.

129
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:27,296
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

130
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:29,798
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.

131
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:34,553
Don't tell me you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.

132
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:36,722
Not a chance.

133
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:38,349
Ned!

134
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:41,143
Ryerson!

135
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:43,729
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.

136
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:46,357
Come on, buddy.
Case Western High!

137
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:50,486
I did the whistling bellybutton
trick at the talent show.

138
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:55,616
Bing! Got the shingles real bad
senior year. Almost didn't graduate.

139
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:57,785
Bing again!

140
00:10:57,993 --> 00:11:02,081
I dated your sister a couple times
till you told me not to anymore.

141
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:03,582
Well?

142
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,292
Ned Ryerson?

143
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,502
Bing!

144
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:08,045
Bing.

145
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,799
Did you turn pro with
that bellybutton thing?

146
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:13,384
I sell insurance.

147
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:15,886
- What a shock.
- Do you have insurance?

148
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,055
If you do, you could
always use more.

149
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:20,891
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

150
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:25,688
I would love to stand here
and talk with you.

151
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:27,189
But I'm not going to.

152
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:28,399
See you.

153
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:30,484
That's all right!
I'll walk with you.

154
00:11:30,693 --> 00:11:33,612
I see an opportunity,
I charge it like a bull.

155
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:35,698
Ned the Bull, that's me now.

156
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:39,493
I got friends who live and die
by the actuarial tables.

157
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:42,788
I say it's all one big
crapshoot anyhoo.

158
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:47,918
Ever heard of single-premium life?
That could be the ticket for you.

159
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:49,587
Oh, God!

160
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:53,757
It is so good to see you!
What are you doing for dinner?

161
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:55,301
Something else.

162
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:59,013
It's been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.

163
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:06,812
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

164
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:36,800
Phil!

165
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:38,636
Phil, over here!

166
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:40,346
Where have you been?

167
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:42,139
It was horrible.

168
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:44,308
A giant leech got me.

169
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:47,144
You're missing all the fun.
These people are great!

170
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:51,023
Some of them partied all night.
They sing till they get cold.

171
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:53,859
Then they go sit by the fire
and get warm.

172
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:56,487
Then they come back
and sing some more!

173
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:59,114
They're hicks, Rita.

174
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,284
So, did you sleep okay without me?

175
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:04,286
You tossed and turned, didn't you?

176
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:05,704
You're incredible.

177
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:07,164
Who told you?

178
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,459
It's groundhog time.

179
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:16,090
Okay.
On me in three...

180
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:18,008
...two, one.

181
00:13:18,968 --> 00:13:23,722
Once a year, the eyes of the nation
turn to this tiny hamlet...

182
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:25,599
...to watch a master at work.

183
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:26,767
The master?

184
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:28,352
Punxsutawney Phil...

185
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:31,897
...the world's most famous weatherman.
The groundhog.

186
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:36,277
Who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.

187
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:39,196
The question we have
to ask ourselves is:

188
00:13:39,446 --> 00:13:41,448
" Does Phil feel lucky?"

189
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:47,705
Every year, the guy comes with
a big stick and raps on the door.

190
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:50,666
They pull the little rat out,
talk to him.

191
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:54,211
The rat talks back.
Then they tell us when it'll end.

192
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:02,428
Isn't he cute?

193
00:14:04,471 --> 00:14:07,891
Do you like the guys
with the prominent upper teeth?

194
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:22,323
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

195
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:23,991
...Punxsutawney Phil...

196
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:25,784
...the seer of seers...

197
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:28,996
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

198
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:31,206
...emerged reluctantly...

199
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:32,499
...but alertly...

200
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,752
...in Punxsutawney, PA...

201
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:37,671
...and stated in groundhog-ese...

202
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:40,090
..." I definitely see a shadow."

203
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:46,764
Sorry, folks.
Six more weeks of winter.

204
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:55,022
On me in three, two, one.

205
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:58,692
This is one time where
television fails...

206
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:01,779
...to capture the excitement
of a large squirrel...

207
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,238
...predicting the weather.

208
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:06,784
I'm grateful to have been here.
From Punxsutawney...

209
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:09,703
...this is Phil Connors.
So long.

210
00:15:09,912 --> 00:15:12,081
Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?

211
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:14,875
We got it.
I'm out of here.

212
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:17,419
Prima donnas.

213
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,726
Oh, boy.
Take a look at this.

214
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:35,521
What is going on?

215
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:39,692
I don't know. Perhaps that
blizzard we're not supposed to get.

216
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:41,819
This is impossible.

217
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:46,824
Nobody honks this horn but me,
okay, pal?

218
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,722
Take it out of here.

219
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:12,558
Commander, what's going on?

220
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:14,935
Nothing.
We're closing the road.

221
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:18,772
- Big blizzard moving in.
- It's a couple of flakes.

222
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:21,692
Don't you listen to the weather?

223
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:23,902
I make the weather.

224
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:29,116
All this moisture from the Gulf
will push off to the east in Altoona.

225
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:31,827
You got that moisture on your head.

226
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:34,038
You can go back to Punxsutawney...

227
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:37,583
...or you can freeze to death.
It's your choice.

228
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:39,960
So, what's it going to be?

229
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:44,089
I'm thinking.

230
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:48,302
Come on, all the long-distance
lines are down?

231
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:50,596
What about the satellite?

232
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:52,765
Is it snowing in space?

233
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:58,270
Don't you keep a line open
for emergencies or celebrities?

234
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:02,775
I'm both.
I'm a celebrity in an emergency.

235
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,778
Can you patch me through
on that line?

236
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:16,247
Could I have one more of these
with some booze in it?

237
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:18,958
I like it here.

238
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,419
Going to the groundhog dinner?

239
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,380
No, I had groundhog for lunch.

240
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:26,882
Wasn't bad.
Tastes like chicken.

241
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,009
You two run along.

242
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:32,388
Looking foxy tonight, man.

243
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,100
Is your troop selling
cookies again this year?

244
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,643
That's so funny.

245
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:39,353
So, what are you doing?

246
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:42,106
I think I'll go back to my room...

247
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:45,901
<i>...take a hot shower
and maybe read Hustler.</i>

248
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,528
Suit yourself.

249
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:07,256
Yo, mom.

250
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:09,216
Isn't there any hot water?

251
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:11,343
Oh, no, there wouldn't be today.

252
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:14,054
Of course not.
Silly me.

253
00:18:14,263 --> 00:18:15,723
Sweet dreams.

254
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:42,541
<i>Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.</i>

255
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,961
<i>- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day!</i>

256
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:48,047
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

257
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:51,592
Nice going, boys.
You're playing yesterday's tape.

258
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:53,302
<i>- with that blizzard thing.</i>

259
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:56,221
<i>That blizzard thing?
Here's the report.</i>

260
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,935
<i>The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing.</i>

261
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:04,146
<i>There's another reason
today's especially ex citing...</i>

262
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:06,398
<i>Especially cold.</i>

263
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:08,817
<i>The big question
on everybody's lips...</i>

264
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:11,612
<i>- Chapped lips.
- Their chapped lips.</i>

265
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:14,740
<i>Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?</i>

266
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:18,285
<i>- Punxsutawney Phil!
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

267
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:19,870
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

268
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,789
<i>Get up and chuck me a hog!</i>

269
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:28,545
What the hell?

270
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:39,515
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

271
00:19:41,141 --> 00:19:42,893
Think it'll be an early spring?

272
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,646
Didn't we do this yesterday?

273
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:47,731
I don't know what you mean.

274
00:19:48,649 --> 00:19:50,651
Don't mess with me, Pork Chop!

275
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:54,113
- What day is this?
- It's February 2nd.

276
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:55,906
Groundhog Day.

277
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:01,745
I'm sorry.
I thought it was yesterday.

278
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:26,270
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

279
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:28,564
Did I sleep well?

280
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:30,524
Like some coffee?

281
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:33,444
Yes, please.
I think I'll have a double.

282
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:36,113
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

283
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,782
There's talk of a blizzard.

284
00:20:41,452 --> 00:20:43,621
Ever have déjá vu,
Mrs. Lancaster?

285
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:46,498
I'll check with the kitchen.

286
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,667
That's okay.
Thank you.

287
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:52,796
Will you be checking out today?

288
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,386
I'd say the chance
of departure is 80 percent.

289
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:02,306
75 to 80.

290
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,979
Excuse me!

291
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:12,024
Excuse me.
Where's everybody going?

292
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,068
To Gobbler's Knob.

293
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:15,527
It's Groundhog Day.

294
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:18,781
It's still just once a year,
isn't it?

295
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:33,420
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

296
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:35,923
My, oh my, Phil Connors!

297
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:40,094
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.

298
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:42,805
- Well?
- Ned Ryerson?

299
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:46,392
Bing! First shot
right out of the box!

300
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,228
So how's it going, old buddy?

301
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,356
I'm not feeling well.
Would you excuse me?

302
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:57,403
It's funny you should mention
your health. Guess what I do now.

303
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:59,655
Do you sell insurance?

304
00:21:59,947 --> 00:22:02,783
Bing again!
You are sharp as a tack today!

305
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,868
Do you have life insurance?

306
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,413
If you do, you could
always use more.

307
00:22:07,663 --> 00:22:09,582
Right! I mean, who couldn't?

308
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:11,166
But you want to know something?

309
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,419
I gots a feeling...

310
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,337
...you ain't got any.

311
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:18,424
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

312
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:20,009
I got to go.

313
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:28,434
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

314
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,461
Phil! Over here!

315
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,299
- Where have you been?
- Rita. Do me a favour.

316
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:03,636
I need someone to give me a
good, hard slap in the face.

317
00:23:05,304 --> 00:23:06,722
How's that?

318
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:07,765
Good!

319
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:11,727
If you need help with the other cheek,
I'm right here.

320
00:23:13,395 --> 00:23:14,855
Something's going on.

321
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:17,816
- Are you drunk or something?
- Drunk's more fun.

322
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:20,069
Can I be serious with you
for a minute?

323
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:21,403
Can you?

324
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:23,447
I'm being serious!

325
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:27,701
I'm having a problem.
I may be having a problem.

326
00:23:28,994 --> 00:23:30,162
It's groundhog time.

327
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:32,623
See? I knew you'd say that!

328
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,583
I really feel...

329
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,252
...weird.

330
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,796
Let's just do this.
Then we'll talk.

331
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:42,591
All right, on me in three...

332
00:23:43,092 --> 00:23:44,635
...two, one.

333
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:46,971
Well, it's Groundhog Day...

334
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:48,555
...again...

335
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:51,684
...and that must mean we're
up here at Gobbler's Knob...

336
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:55,688
...waiting for the world's most famous
groundhog weatherman...

337
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:57,231
...Punxsutawney Phil...

338
00:23:57,481 --> 00:24:01,443
...who's gonna tell us how much more
winter to expect.

339
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:08,534
This is a riot!

340
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,247
Isn't he cute?

341
00:24:14,373 --> 00:24:18,252
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

342
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:22,172
...Punxsutawney Phil,
the seer of seers...

343
00:24:22,715 --> 00:24:25,259
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

344
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,469
...emerged reluctantly...

345
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,972
...but alertly in Punxsu...

346
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:34,518
Oh, my gosh!

347
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:39,106
I know there's a blizzard.

348
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:42,443
When will the long-distance
lines be repaired?

349
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,490
What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.

350
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:46,590
Morning!

351
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,384
Off to see the groundhog?

352
00:25:54,974 --> 00:25:57,059
Did you sleep well, Mr...

353
00:26:11,532 --> 00:26:13,576
Phil Connors! I thought...

354
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,372
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you!

355
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:20,666
It's me, Ned! Ryerson!

356
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:23,377
Needlenose Ned! Ned the Head!

357
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:30,301
Phil! Over here!

358
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:34,638
Can I talk to you?
It's not work-related.

359
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:37,766
- You never talk about work.
- We have to talk.

360
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:41,103
- It's a creative meeting.
- We've got work to do!

361
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:43,731
I don't.
I've already done it twice.

362
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:46,942
When you get finished,
meet me in the diner.

363
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:52,489
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.

364
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,325
Prima donnas.

365
00:26:57,912 --> 00:26:58,913
More coffee?

366
00:26:59,121 --> 00:27:02,958
Just the check, please.
These sticky buns are heaven.

367
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,668
Aren't they?

368
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:08,505
Just put that anywhere, pal!

369
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:10,299
Good save!

370
00:27:11,926 --> 00:27:15,262
Tell me why you're too sick to work.
It better be good.

371
00:27:17,473 --> 00:27:21,352
I'm reliving the same day
over and over.

372
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:24,063
Groundhog Day. Today.

373
00:27:24,647 --> 00:27:27,816
Okay. I'm waiting for the punch line.

374
00:27:28,108 --> 00:27:30,986
Really! This is the third time!

375
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:33,197
It's like yesterday never happened!

376
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:37,409
I'm racking my brain trying to imagine
why you'd make this up.

377
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,996
I'm not making it up.
I'm asking for help!

378
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:43,540
What do you want me to do?

379
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:47,086
I don't know! You're a producer.
Come up with something.

380
00:27:47,294 --> 00:27:49,922
You should get
your head examined...

381
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:53,467
...if you expect me to believe
a stupid story like that!

382
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,469
Phil? Like the groundhog Phil?

383
00:27:55,803 --> 00:27:58,389
Yeah. Like the groundhog Phil.

384
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:01,225
Look out for your shadow, pal!

385
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:04,019
Morons, your bus is leaving!

386
00:28:05,104 --> 00:28:08,732
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

387
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:13,529
- Let's talk about it in Pittsburgh.
- I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.

388
00:28:13,821 --> 00:28:16,031
- Why not?
- Because of the blizzard!

389
00:28:16,323 --> 00:28:18,742
You said it was going
to hit Altoona.

390
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:21,620
I know that's what I said.

391
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:24,331
I think you need help.

392
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:28,210
That's what I've been saying.
I need help.

393
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:30,838
No spots.

394
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:33,549
No clots, no tumours.

395
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,175
No lesions.

396
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:36,969
No aneurysms.

397
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:38,762
At least none that I can see.

398
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:42,891
If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you'll have to go into Pittsburgh.

399
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,311
I can't go into Pittsburgh.

400
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:49,148
- Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
- I told you, there's a blizzard.

401
00:28:49,356 --> 00:28:50,608
Right. The blizzard!

402
00:28:50,858 --> 00:28:53,527
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?

403
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,654
A biopsy.

404
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:57,907
A psychiatrist.

405
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:02,119
That's an unusual problem...

406
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:03,454
...Mr. Connors.

407
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:09,960
Most of my work is with couples,
families. I have an alcoholic now.

408
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:14,048
You went to college, right?

409
00:29:14,256 --> 00:29:16,592
It wasn't veterinary
psychology, was it?

410
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:19,803
Didn't you take a course that
covered this stuff?

411
00:29:20,012 --> 00:29:22,514
Sort of, I guess.

412
00:29:24,183 --> 00:29:25,935
Abnormal psychology.

413
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:28,312
So...

414
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:30,731
...what do I do?

415
00:29:31,565 --> 00:29:32,900
We should meet again.

416
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,861
How's tomorrow for you?

417
00:29:38,614 --> 00:29:39,990
Is that not good?

418
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:53,629
I was in the Virgin Islands once.

419
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,881
I met a girl.

420
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,383
We ate lobster.

421
00:29:57,633 --> 00:29:59,635
Drank piña coladas.

422
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:02,429
At sunset, we made love
like sea otters.

423
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:08,602
That was a pretty good day.

424
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:10,688
Why couldn't I get that day...

425
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:12,022
...over...

426
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:14,441
...and over and over?

427
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:18,612
Some guys would look
at this glass and say:

428
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:20,281
"That glass is half empty."

429
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:24,326
Other guys would say,
"That glass is half full."

430
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:27,913
I peg you as a "glass is half empty"
kind of guy. Right?

431
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:33,252
What would you do if you were
stuck in one place...

432
00:30:33,502 --> 00:30:37,423
...and every day was exactly the same,
and nothing you did mattered?

433
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:42,761
That about sums it up for me.

434
00:30:50,352 --> 00:30:51,353
Good luck.

435
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:53,022
I'll drop you off.

436
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,401
This thing sticks a little bit.

437
00:30:57,651 --> 00:30:59,153
You got to jiggle it...

438
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:01,572
Come on up here, pal.

439
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,241
Give me your keys, pal.
Give me the keys.

440
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,202
Friends don't let friends drive, right?
Stand up here.

441
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:10,372
Take a deep breath. You feel okay?

442
00:31:10,623 --> 00:31:11,999
You're all right.

443
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:21,175
You want to throw up here
or in the car?

444
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,094
I think, both.

445
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:37,232
I don't think I should drive.

446
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:39,360
I don't either.

447
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,986
Watch your head.

448
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:44,365
Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.

449
00:31:44,615 --> 00:31:46,742
Let's not forget seat belts.

450
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:51,830
Who else could go for some
flapjacks right now?

451
00:31:57,086 --> 00:31:58,796
Let me ask you a question.

452
00:31:59,046 --> 00:31:59,922
Shoot.

453
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:03,425
What if there were no tomorrow?

454
00:32:03,968 --> 00:32:07,263
No tomorrow? That means there'd be
no consequences...

455
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:09,056
...no hangovers.

456
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:11,767
We could do whatever we wanted!

457
00:32:13,185 --> 00:32:14,561
That's true.

458
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,898
We could do whatever we want.

459
00:32:23,487 --> 00:32:27,032
If we wanted to hit mailboxes,
we could let Ralph drive!

460
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:35,416
They want you to stop.

461
00:32:35,624 --> 00:32:36,542
Hang on!

462
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:44,300
It's the same thing
your whole life.

463
00:32:44,758 --> 00:32:47,678
" Clean up your room! Stand up
straight! Pick up your feet!

464
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:49,680
Take it like a man!

465
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:51,557
Be nice to your sister!

466
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:54,893
Don't mix beer and wine, ever!

467
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:58,897
Don't drive on the railroad tracks!"

468
00:33:00,482 --> 00:33:01,775
That's one I agree with.

469
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:13,495
I don't know, Gus.

470
00:33:13,746 --> 00:33:16,498
Sometimes I think you just have to...

471
00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:19,126
...take the big chances.

472
00:33:19,543 --> 00:33:21,712
<i>This is the police! Pull over now!</i>

473
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:25,299
We're talking in here!

474
00:33:30,471 --> 00:33:32,389
I bet he swerves first.

475
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:49,907
I'm not going to live by
their rules anymore!

476
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:51,742
I noticed that.

477
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:54,495
You make choices
and you live with them.

478
00:34:09,218 --> 00:34:10,219
My knee!

479
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:14,890
Let me handle this.

480
00:34:17,476 --> 00:34:20,229
Three cheeseburgers,
two large fries...

481
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:22,481
...two chocolate shakes
and one large Coke.

482
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:24,692
And some flapjacks!

483
00:34:24,942 --> 00:34:26,777
Too early for flapjacks?

484
00:34:40,332 --> 00:34:41,625
Yes!

485
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:44,503
Rise and shine, campers!

486
00:34:44,753 --> 00:34:47,756
Don't forget your booties!
It's cold out there today!

487
00:34:48,007 --> 00:34:49,383
It's cold every day.

488
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:52,720
What is this, Miami Beach?
Not hardly!

489
00:34:57,308 --> 00:34:58,726
Slept like a baby.

490
00:34:58,976 --> 00:35:00,978
I'd love some of your coffee.

491
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:03,022
- I hope...
- Flurries moving in later...

492
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,399
...but the blizzard's going to hit
outside of town.

493
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:06,650
Mrs. Lancaster?

494
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,194
Was anybody looking for me
here this morning?

495
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:12,865
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?

496
00:35:13,073 --> 00:35:15,993
No, no one like that!
Will there be?

497
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:17,870
Apparently not.

498
00:35:19,997 --> 00:35:23,375
Will you hold my room for me?
I'm staying an extra day.

499
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:31,216
Catch you tomorrow, pops.

500
00:35:36,722 --> 00:35:38,933
- Phil Connors!
- Ned?

501
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:13,634
I like to see a man of advancing years
throw caution to the wind.

502
00:36:13,842 --> 00:36:16,136
It's inspiring, in a way.

503
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:19,390
My years are not advancing
as fast as you think.

504
00:36:20,057 --> 00:36:20,891
More coffee?

505
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:22,726
Keep it coming.

506
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,186
Sure thing.

507
00:36:26,021 --> 00:36:28,399
Just put that anywhere, pal!

508
00:36:28,774 --> 00:36:30,025
Good save!

509
00:36:32,111 --> 00:36:35,864
Don't you worry about cholesterol,
lung cancer, love handles?

510
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,910
I don't worry anymore.

511
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:42,663
What makes you special?
Everybody worries.

512
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:45,749
That's exactly what makes me
so special.

513
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:47,751
I don't even have to floss.

514
00:36:57,553 --> 00:36:58,429
What?

515
00:37:00,347 --> 00:37:04,018
<i>The wretch, concentred all in self</i>

516
00:37:04,435 --> 00:37:06,770
<i>Living, shall forfeit fair renown</i>

517
00:37:07,187 --> 00:37:10,107
<i>And doubly dying, shall go down</i>

518
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:13,319
<i>To the vile dust from whence he sprung</i>

519
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:14,945
<i>Unwept...</i>

520
00:37:15,154 --> 00:37:17,615
<i>... unhonoured and unsung</i>

521
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,284
Sir Walter Scott.

522
00:37:23,412 --> 00:37:24,830
You don't like poetry?

523
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:26,957
I love poetry!

524
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:30,294
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.

525
00:37:30,794 --> 00:37:33,255
You think I act like this
because I'm egocentric?

526
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:36,675
You are egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.

527
00:37:38,928 --> 00:37:42,598
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

528
00:37:42,806 --> 00:37:43,682
Thanks, Larry.

529
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:46,143
Would you like a doggie bag?

530
00:37:46,602 --> 00:37:48,020
I'll stay and finish.

531
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,522
I thought you hated this town.

532
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:52,608
It's beginning to grow on me.

533
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:55,236
Larry, quit staring.

534
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:58,447
<i>- These are excellent.
- Bon appétit.</i>

535
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:11,168
You see the groundhog
this morning?

536
00:38:12,836 --> 00:38:14,505
I never miss it.

537
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:16,382
What's your name?

538
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:20,344
Nancy Taylor. And you are?

539
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:23,097
- What high school did you go to?
- What?

540
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:24,348
High school.

541
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:28,310
Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.
Who are you?

542
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:31,730
Who was your 12th grade
English teacher?

543
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:33,357
Are you kidding?

544
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:35,818
In 12th grade,
your English teacher was...

545
00:38:36,026 --> 00:38:37,945
Mrs. Walsh.

546
00:38:38,153 --> 00:38:41,198
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.

547
00:38:41,865 --> 00:38:43,909
Thanks very much.

548
00:38:59,008 --> 00:39:00,593
Nancy?

549
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:03,929
Nancy Taylor!

550
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,640
Lincoln High School!

551
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:10,394
I sat next to you in
Mrs. Walsh's English class!

552
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:14,148
- I'm sorry.
- Phil Connors!

553
00:39:15,482 --> 00:39:17,901
- That's amazing!
- You don't remember me?

554
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:22,239
I asked you to the prom.

555
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,242
Phil Connors?

556
00:39:25,784 --> 00:39:27,995
I was short and I've sprouted.

557
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:34,126
How are you?

558
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:35,878
Great.

559
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:37,838
You look terrific!

560
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,300
You look very, very terrific!

561
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:45,220
Listen, I got to go do this report.

562
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:46,680
Are you a reporter?

563
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:49,391
A weatherman with
Channel 9, Pittsburgh.

564
00:39:49,642 --> 00:39:51,560
I should have known! That's great!

565
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:53,520
But maybe later we could...

566
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:54,980
Yeah, whatever!

567
00:39:55,314 --> 00:39:56,982
Stay right here.

568
00:39:57,399 --> 00:40:00,569
Promise me?
I'll be right back. Wish me luck!

569
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:02,529
Good luck!

570
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:21,715
Oh, Phil.

571
00:40:22,758 --> 00:40:24,134
Oh, Rita.

572
00:40:28,013 --> 00:40:29,223
Who's Rita?

573
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:31,308
How should I know?

574
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,144
What is this,
some kind of one-night stand?

575
00:40:34,395 --> 00:40:36,355
On the contrary, Nancy...

576
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:39,858
...I love you.
I've always loved you.

577
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:43,153
This is going to seem sudden but...

578
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,532
...Nancy, will you be my wife?

579
00:40:53,414 --> 00:40:54,873
Rita.

580
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:58,210
- Nancy.
- Whatever.

581
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:04,883
A gust of wind.

582
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:08,429
A dog barks.

583
00:41:09,763 --> 00:41:11,223
Cue the truck.

584
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:20,149
Exit Herman.

585
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:22,735
Walk on to the bank.

586
00:41:22,985 --> 00:41:27,031
Exit Felix, and stand there with a
not-so-bright look on your face.

587
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:30,951
All right, Doris. Come on.

588
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:34,538
Fix your bra, honey.
That's better.

589
00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:36,957
Felix!

590
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:38,626
How you doing, Doris?

591
00:41:38,834 --> 00:41:41,420
Can I have a roll of quarters?

592
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:47,259
Ten... nine... eight...

593
00:41:47,968 --> 00:41:49,303
...car...

594
00:41:49,511 --> 00:41:52,598
...six... five...

595
00:41:52,848 --> 00:41:54,975
...quarters...

596
00:41:55,351 --> 00:41:58,938
...three... two...

597
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:07,905
Felix?

598
00:42:08,113 --> 00:42:11,700
- Did I bring out two bags or one?
- I don't know.

599
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:41,522
I thought we were going
to a costume party.

600
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:44,650
It's like I said, I love this film.

601
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,111
I've seen it over 100 times.

602
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:48,362
Phil!

603
00:42:48,612 --> 00:42:49,863
Told you...

604
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:52,366
...call me " Bronco."

605
00:42:52,616 --> 00:42:54,410
Sorry, Bronco.

606
00:42:55,661 --> 00:42:57,329
Hi, Nancy.

607
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:03,502
My own fiancée...

608
00:43:03,752 --> 00:43:05,879
...doesn't remember me.

609
00:43:09,008 --> 00:43:11,552
That'll be one adult and...

610
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:15,055
- Two adults.
- Two adults, I guess.

611
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:22,980
<i>- groundhog who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.</i>

612
00:43:23,188 --> 00:43:25,941
<i>The question we have
to ask ourselves today is:</i>

613
00:43:26,191 --> 00:43:28,152
<i>"Does Phil feel lucky?"</i>

614
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,155
Rita, if you only
had one day to live...

615
00:43:31,405 --> 00:43:33,032
...what would you do?

616
00:43:33,282 --> 00:43:35,826
I don't know.
What are you dying of?

617
00:43:36,076 --> 00:43:40,539
No, the whole world
is about to explode.

618
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:41,749
What do you do?

619
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:44,293
I want to know
where to put the camera.

620
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:47,004
What are you looking for?
A date for the weekend?

621
00:43:47,254 --> 00:43:50,090
No, I'm just interested in you.

622
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:52,593
What do you want?
What do you like?

623
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:54,678
What do you think about?

624
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:57,222
What kind of men
are you interested in?

625
00:43:57,431 --> 00:43:59,266
What do you do for fun?

626
00:43:59,934 --> 00:44:03,187
Are you trying to
make me look like a fool?

627
00:44:03,395 --> 00:44:07,608
I'm trying to talk like normal people.
Isn't this how they talk?

628
00:44:07,816 --> 00:44:10,152
- Close.
- Okay, so talk to me.

629
00:44:10,402 --> 00:44:12,613
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

630
00:44:14,907 --> 00:44:15,783
And a doughnut.

631
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:17,618
All right.

632
00:44:19,995 --> 00:44:21,997
<i>So what do you want out of life?</i>

633
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:26,168
I guess I want what everybody wants.

634
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:29,922
Career, love, marriage, children.

635
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:31,799
Are you seeing anyone?

636
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:36,971
This is getting too personal.
I'm not ready to share this with you.

637
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:40,391
How about you?
What do you want?

638
00:44:41,558 --> 00:44:44,853
What I really want
is someone like you.

639
00:44:45,104 --> 00:44:46,397
Oh, please!

640
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:48,816
Why not? What are you looking for?

641
00:44:49,066 --> 00:44:50,401
Who's your perfect guy?

642
00:44:51,777 --> 00:44:55,781
First of all, he's too humble
to know he's perfect.

643
00:44:57,116 --> 00:44:58,492
That's me!

644
00:44:58,742 --> 00:45:02,079
He's intelligent,
supportive, funny...

645
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:04,540
Intelligent, supportive, funny.

646
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:08,127
Me, me, me.

647
00:45:08,377 --> 00:45:11,171
He's romantic and courageous.

648
00:45:11,422 --> 00:45:12,673
Me also.

649
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:16,844
He's got a good body but doesn't
have to look in the mirror often.

650
00:45:17,511 --> 00:45:22,349
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.

651
00:45:24,852 --> 00:45:28,355
He's kind, sensitive and gentle.

652
00:45:28,897 --> 00:45:30,733
He's not afraid to cry.

653
00:45:30,983 --> 00:45:33,569
This is a man
we're talking about, right?

654
00:45:33,819 --> 00:45:38,782
He likes animals, children,
and he'll change poopy diapers.

655
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:41,410
Does he have to use the word " poopy"?

656
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:46,415
He plays an instrument,
and he loves his mother.

657
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:50,419
I am really close on this one.

658
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:53,964
Really, really close.

659
00:45:58,427 --> 00:46:00,012
It's Phil Connors!

660
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,513
Hello.

661
00:46:01,722 --> 00:46:03,557
Thanks for watching.

662
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:19,657
What are the chances
of getting out today?

663
00:46:19,907 --> 00:46:22,159
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.

664
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:23,827
Wouldn't you know it?

665
00:46:24,078 --> 00:46:25,871
Can I buy you a drink?

666
00:46:28,499 --> 00:46:31,168
Jim Beam, ice, water.

667
00:46:32,002 --> 00:46:33,128
For you, miss?

668
00:46:33,587 --> 00:46:36,924
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, please.

669
00:46:42,221 --> 00:46:44,473
What are the chances
of getting out today?

670
00:46:44,723 --> 00:46:47,142
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.

671
00:46:47,393 --> 00:46:49,019
Wouldn't you know it?

672
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:51,105
Can I buy you a drink?

673
00:46:53,983 --> 00:46:56,694
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

674
00:46:56,902 --> 00:46:57,778
For you, miss?

675
00:46:58,153 --> 00:46:59,655
The same.

676
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:02,157
That's my favourite drink.

677
00:47:02,408 --> 00:47:04,159
Mine too!

678
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:05,953
It makes me think of Rome.

679
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:09,456
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

680
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:13,210
What should we drink to?

681
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:16,380
To the groundhog!

682
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:19,258
I always drink to world peace.

683
00:47:28,183 --> 00:47:30,102
Can I buy you a drink?

684
00:47:33,022 --> 00:47:36,066
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

685
00:47:36,734 --> 00:47:38,444
For you, miss?

686
00:47:38,694 --> 00:47:40,362
The same.

687
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:42,448
That's my favourite drink.

688
00:47:42,698 --> 00:47:44,283
Mine too!

689
00:47:45,492 --> 00:47:47,745
It makes me think of Rome.

690
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:51,790
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

691
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:54,710
What should we drink to?

692
00:47:56,754 --> 00:47:59,924
I'd like to say a prayer
and drink to world peace.

693
00:48:01,884 --> 00:48:03,677
To world peace.

694
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:17,066
- This is wonderful!
- See? Didn't I tell you?

695
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:19,318
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?

696
00:48:19,526 --> 00:48:21,946
I spent a lot of time here.

697
00:48:22,196 --> 00:48:24,240
Small-town people are
more real, down-to-earth.

698
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,867
- That's how I feel!
- Really?

699
00:48:27,076 --> 00:48:30,204
- Some white chocolate?
- Yuck, don't make me sick.

700
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:31,622
No white chocolate.

701
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,750
There is something
so familiar about this.

702
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,086
Do you ever have déjá vu?

703
00:48:37,336 --> 00:48:39,546
Didn't you just ask me that?

704
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:47,096
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

705
00:48:47,304 --> 00:48:50,474
I wish we could all live
in the mountains.

706
00:48:50,683 --> 00:48:54,395
That's where I see myself
in five years. How about you?

707
00:48:54,645 --> 00:48:57,481
I agree. I just like
to go with the flow.

708
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,775
See where it leads me.

709
00:49:00,025 --> 00:49:01,860
Well, it's led you here.

710
00:49:03,612 --> 00:49:07,283
It's about a million miles
from where I started in college.

711
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:11,036
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

712
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:16,250
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

713
00:49:16,542 --> 00:49:18,127
What a waste of time!

714
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,297
I mean, for someone else
that'd be a total waste.

715
00:49:21,547 --> 00:49:23,591
So bold of you to choose that.

716
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:27,511
It's incredible.
You must be a very strong person.

717
00:49:29,263 --> 00:49:32,766
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

718
00:49:33,017 --> 00:49:37,563
I wish we could all
live in the mountains.

719
00:49:37,813 --> 00:49:40,065
That's where I see myself
in five years.

720
00:49:40,274 --> 00:49:41,275
How about you?

721
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:45,446
I agree. I like to go
with the flow, see what happens.

722
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:47,990
Well, it's gotten you here.

723
00:49:48,532 --> 00:49:51,744
It's a million miles
from where I started in college.

724
00:49:51,994 --> 00:49:55,456
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism or anything like that?

725
00:49:56,582 --> 00:50:00,669
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

726
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:18,896
You speak French!

727
00:50:24,735 --> 00:50:27,404
I haven't done this since I was a kid.

728
00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:29,448
Me neither. It's fun!

729
00:50:29,907 --> 00:50:30,783
Clean fun.

730
00:50:33,661 --> 00:50:37,164
I hope one day I can do this
with my own children.

731
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:42,836
Where'd you get that?

732
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:45,714
Well, I went over
to the snowman shop.

733
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:49,093
Hey, an assassin!

734
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:51,136
I'll protect you!

735
00:50:51,637 --> 00:50:54,390
I shall die for you.
You shall not take her!

736
00:50:54,598 --> 00:50:55,891
Find cover!

737
00:50:58,227 --> 00:51:00,562
I'm getting some good ones.

738
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:03,649
That's a boy! Good try.

739
00:51:03,857 --> 00:51:05,526
Help me!

740
00:52:01,498 --> 00:52:02,666
What?

741
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:06,962
I'm just amazed,
and I'm not easily amazed.

742
00:52:07,212 --> 00:52:08,631
About what?

743
00:52:08,881 --> 00:52:11,634
How you can start a day with one
kind of expectation...

744
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:13,928
...and end up
so completely different.

745
00:52:15,346 --> 00:52:18,515
Do you like the way
this day is turning out?

746
00:52:18,724 --> 00:52:21,143
I like it very much.

747
00:52:21,393 --> 00:52:24,897
It's a perfect day.
You couldn't plan a day like this.

748
00:52:25,147 --> 00:52:26,398
Well, you can.

749
00:52:26,607 --> 00:52:29,610
It just takes an awful lot of work.

750
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,071
Come in.
I want to show you something.

751
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:34,573
- I don't think I should.
- I agree.

752
00:52:34,823 --> 00:52:39,161
That's why I'll show you one thing,
then kick you right out.

753
00:52:47,336 --> 00:52:49,588
It's just lovely.

754
00:52:59,974 --> 00:53:02,726
Would you like to sit
and stare at the fake fire?

755
00:53:07,398 --> 00:53:09,608
It's a really wonderful room.

756
00:53:09,858 --> 00:53:11,694
It is now.

757
00:53:18,617 --> 00:53:21,078
I don't think we should do this.

758
00:53:21,328 --> 00:53:22,955
I don't either.

759
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:28,377
On second thought,
I think we should.

760
00:53:29,211 --> 00:53:32,381
It's the perfect end
to a perfect day.

761
00:53:32,965 --> 00:53:35,884
Well, it's a little fast for me.

762
00:53:36,135 --> 00:53:37,553
Me too.

763
00:53:38,012 --> 00:53:40,264
Maybe I should go.

764
00:53:40,472 --> 00:53:42,391
Where would you go?

765
00:53:42,641 --> 00:53:44,018
Why?

766
00:53:44,226 --> 00:53:46,520
We've got a perfect fire.

767
00:53:46,812 --> 00:53:49,857
I've got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire...

768
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,902
I will read to you.

769
00:53:53,652 --> 00:53:57,781
I've got some ice cream on
the windowsill. Hold on a minute.

770
00:54:03,412 --> 00:54:04,455
Rocky road.

771
00:54:04,705 --> 00:54:06,248
I love rocky road.

772
00:54:06,498 --> 00:54:08,417
Yeah, I thought so.

773
00:54:08,709 --> 00:54:10,419
You have to stay.

774
00:54:10,669 --> 00:54:14,465
No, really, I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.

775
00:54:14,715 --> 00:54:18,469
No, tonight.
It's got to be tonight.

776
00:54:18,677 --> 00:54:21,555
No, Phil, really.

777
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:25,726
Just stay for a while and
if you like it, stay longer.

778
00:54:25,935 --> 00:54:28,062
And if you like that, stay longer.

779
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,147
Let's not spoil it, okay?

780
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:32,816
I don't want to spoil it either.

781
00:54:33,025 --> 00:54:35,945
You know I can't stay with you.

782
00:54:36,195 --> 00:54:39,281
Why not? I love you.

783
00:54:41,325 --> 00:54:43,452
You love me?

784
00:54:43,702 --> 00:54:47,831
- You don't even know me.
- I know you.

785
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:52,336
Oh, no. I can't believe
I fell for this!

786
00:54:52,586 --> 00:54:54,964
This whole day has been
one long setup.

787
00:54:55,214 --> 00:54:56,173
No, it hasn't.

788
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:59,176
And I hate fudge. Yuck!

789
00:54:59,468 --> 00:55:01,512
No white chocolate, no fudge.

790
00:55:02,096 --> 00:55:05,516
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of list?

791
00:55:05,724 --> 00:55:08,936
Did you call my friends
and ask them what I like?

792
00:55:09,186 --> 00:55:12,690
- Is this what love is for you?
- This is real. This is love.

793
00:55:12,898 --> 00:55:14,358
Stop saying that!

794
00:55:14,984 --> 00:55:16,527
You must be crazy.

795
00:55:16,777 --> 00:55:20,489
I could never love you because
you'll never love anyone but yourself.

796
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:24,618
I don't even like myself.
Give me another chance.

797
00:55:26,287 --> 00:55:28,914
That's for making me
care about you.

798
00:55:35,879 --> 00:55:38,340
I haven't done this
since I was a kid.

799
00:55:38,591 --> 00:55:39,592
It's fun!

800
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,138
And good, clean fun too.
That's what's missing in the world.

801
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:47,099
I can't wait to do this
with my own children.

802
00:55:47,308 --> 00:55:48,851
I want lots of kids!

803
00:55:49,101 --> 00:55:52,938
I want to adopt, I want my own kids,
I want to have foster kids.

804
00:55:53,188 --> 00:55:55,441
I got this at Snowman City.

805
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:58,527
Hey! Some kid just
threw a snowball at us.

806
00:55:58,777 --> 00:56:01,614
Come here! Let's have some fun!

807
00:56:03,824 --> 00:56:06,619
I wish these were my own kids.

808
00:56:09,246 --> 00:56:11,874
Are any of you up for adoption?

809
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:15,002
Here's a humdinger over here!

810
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:17,296
Wasn't that great?

811
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:27,348
Stop it!

812
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:14,144
Phil! Over here!

813
00:57:16,522 --> 00:57:19,149
Where have you been?
You're missing the fun.

814
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,277
Phil, you look terrible.

815
00:57:21,944 --> 00:57:24,446
What happened? Rough night?

816
00:57:42,673 --> 00:57:44,341
Okay, campers.

817
00:57:44,758 --> 00:57:46,594
Rise and shine.

818
00:57:48,512 --> 00:57:52,182
Don't forget your booties,
because it's cold out there.

819
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,519
It's cold out there every day.

820
00:57:56,020 --> 00:58:00,065
<i>This country's largest lake,
Chapala, is located near Guadalajara.</i>

821
00:58:01,233 --> 00:58:02,318
What is Mexico?

822
00:58:02,526 --> 00:58:03,569
<i>What is Mexico?</i>

823
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,738
<i>- Correct.
- Lakes and Rivers, 400.</i>

824
00:58:05,988 --> 00:58:08,657
<i>Seneca is the largest
of these lakes.</i>

825
00:58:09,325 --> 00:58:10,826
What are the Finger Lakes?

826
00:58:11,035 --> 00:58:13,996
<i>- What are the Finger Lakes?
- Correct.</i>

827
00:58:14,204 --> 00:58:18,375
<i>- This lake in Bolivia...
- What is Titicaca?</i>

828
00:58:18,626 --> 00:58:20,377
<i>- What is Titicaca?
- Correct.</i>

829
00:58:20,586 --> 00:58:21,545
<i>For 1000.</i>

830
00:58:21,754 --> 00:58:23,672
<i>- Milky-coloured...
- The Rhone.</i>

831
00:58:23,923 --> 00:58:25,549
<i>... when entering Lake Geneva...</i>

832
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:28,344
<i>... this river is
clear blue upon exiting.</i>

833
00:58:28,552 --> 00:58:29,511
<i>- Jim?
- The Rhone.</i>

834
00:58:29,762 --> 00:58:31,096
<i>Good for $1000.</i>

835
00:58:31,347 --> 00:58:33,766
<i>You're $500 off the lead right now.</i>

836
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,229
This is pitiful.

837
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:39,980
A thousand people...

838
00:58:40,231 --> 00:58:43,234
...freezing their butts off,
waiting to worship a rat.

839
00:58:43,442 --> 00:58:45,027
What a hype.

840
00:58:45,694 --> 00:58:49,740
They used to pull the hog out,
and they used to eat it.

841
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:53,077
You're hypocrites! All of you!

842
00:58:55,371 --> 00:58:56,914
You got a problem, Larry?

843
00:58:58,374 --> 00:59:03,212
Untie your tongue. Come here and talk.
Am I upsetting you, princess?

844
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,214
You want a prediction
about the weather?

845
00:59:05,464 --> 00:59:08,133
You're asking the wrong Phil.

846
00:59:08,384 --> 00:59:11,053
I'll give you a winter prediction.

847
00:59:11,303 --> 00:59:13,347
It's going to be cold.

848
00:59:13,597 --> 00:59:15,808
It's going to be gray.

849
00:59:16,016 --> 00:59:20,813
And it's going to last you
for the rest of your life.

850
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:59,393
Once again the eyes of the nation
have turned here...

851
00:59:59,894 --> 01:00:03,147
...to this tiny village
in Western Pennsylvania.

852
01:00:03,355 --> 01:00:06,275
There is no way that this winter...

853
01:00:06,525 --> 01:00:09,403
...is ever going to end...

854
01:00:09,612 --> 01:00:13,574
...as long as this groundhog
keeps seeing his shadow.

855
01:00:13,824 --> 01:00:15,701
I don't see any other way out.

856
01:00:16,493 --> 01:00:18,370
He's got to be stopped.

857
01:00:19,872 --> 01:00:21,248
And I have to stop it.

858
01:00:23,792 --> 01:00:26,128
Real good, Phil.
Real good.

859
01:00:27,713 --> 01:00:29,298
He's out of his gourd.

860
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:37,348
I'm worried. There's something
really wrong with Phil.

861
01:00:37,598 --> 01:00:40,267
There's a lot of things
wrong with Phil.

862
01:00:42,436 --> 01:00:43,687
Hi, Phil.

863
01:00:44,104 --> 01:00:46,232
I've come to the end of me.

864
01:00:46,482 --> 01:00:48,609
There's no way out now.

865
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:53,405
Just remember, we had
a beautiful day together once.

866
01:00:56,825 --> 01:00:58,244
All right, little fellow.

867
01:00:58,494 --> 01:01:01,872
Good job. He just smiled at me!
Did you see that?

868
01:01:02,122 --> 01:01:03,624
I believe he did.

869
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:07,378
Okay, little fellow.
There you go.

870
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,757
Hi, there. Something I can
do you for?

871
01:01:14,343 --> 01:01:16,262
Hey! What are you doing?

872
01:01:21,016 --> 01:01:23,060
Get the word out.
Somebody kidnapped Phil!

873
01:01:23,435 --> 01:01:24,770
We are going after him!

874
01:01:31,443 --> 01:01:33,862
Why would anybody steal a groundhog?

875
01:01:34,321 --> 01:01:36,156
I could think of reasons.

876
01:01:36,365 --> 01:01:37,324
Pervert.

877
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:05,144
He must have just snapped!

878
01:02:05,352 --> 01:02:06,687
This ought to be good.

879
01:02:09,064 --> 01:02:10,316
What is he doing?

880
01:02:10,524 --> 01:02:12,067
What can he be thinking?

881
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,320
Not bad for a quadruped.

882
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:18,490
Check your mirrors. Side of your eye.
Side of your eye.

883
01:02:24,538 --> 01:02:26,040
That's it.

884
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:29,335
Hey, they're chasing us!
Come on, make it fun.

885
01:02:37,551 --> 01:02:38,719
Don't drive angry.

886
01:02:38,928 --> 01:02:40,137
Don't drive angry.

887
01:03:00,157 --> 01:03:03,035
There's no way out
except the way we came in!

888
01:03:03,285 --> 01:03:04,745
We got him now!

889
01:03:24,056 --> 01:03:25,266
What is he doing?

890
01:03:25,516 --> 01:03:26,517
I don't know.

891
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:33,649
If you got to shoot,
don't hit the groundhog.

892
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:40,197
Mustn't keep them waiting.

893
01:03:43,534 --> 01:03:44,868
It's showtime.

894
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:52,543
On me in three...

895
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:55,504
...two...

896
01:03:57,423 --> 01:03:58,382
...one.

897
01:04:12,187 --> 01:04:13,230
Phil!

898
01:04:15,566 --> 01:04:16,942
He might be okay.

899
01:04:21,572 --> 01:04:24,116
Well, no. Probably not now.

900
01:04:39,757 --> 01:04:41,008
Nuts.

901
01:04:48,933 --> 01:04:51,852
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

902
01:04:52,895 --> 01:04:54,563
Would you like...

903
01:04:55,189 --> 01:04:56,607
...some toast?

904
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:17,044
Oh, my God!

905
01:05:49,618 --> 01:05:50,995
That's him.

906
01:05:54,164 --> 01:05:57,585
He was a really, really great guy.

907
01:05:57,835 --> 01:05:59,545
I really, really liked him...

908
01:05:59,962 --> 01:06:01,005
...a lot.

909
01:06:08,345 --> 01:06:10,347
I'm sorry?
What was that again?

910
01:06:10,764 --> 01:06:13,517
- I'm a god.
- You're God?

911
01:06:13,726 --> 01:06:16,979
I'm a god. I'm not the God,
I don't think.

912
01:06:17,563 --> 01:06:19,690
Because you survived a car wreck?

913
01:06:19,899 --> 01:06:21,066
You folks ready to order?

914
01:06:21,317 --> 01:06:24,528
I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just blown up.

915
01:06:24,945 --> 01:06:27,531
I have been stabbed,
shot, poisoned...

916
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:31,076
...frozen, hung, electrocuted
and burned.

917
01:06:31,285 --> 01:06:32,620
Oh, really.

918
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:37,082
Every morning I wake up without a
scratch, not a dent in the fender.

919
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:38,876
I am an immortal.

920
01:06:39,084 --> 01:06:41,712
Special today is blueberry waffles.

921
01:06:41,921 --> 01:06:43,756
Why are you telling me this?

922
01:06:44,048 --> 01:06:46,175
Because I want you to believe in me.

923
01:06:46,383 --> 01:06:47,718
You are not a god.

924
01:06:47,927 --> 01:06:51,347
Take my word. It's 12 years
of Catholic school talking.

925
01:06:51,889 --> 01:06:53,849
I can come back if you're not ready.

926
01:06:54,058 --> 01:06:56,060
How do you know I'm not a god?

927
01:06:56,268 --> 01:06:57,519
Please.

928
01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:00,105
- How do you know?
- It's not possible.

929
01:07:00,314 --> 01:07:02,066
I'll come back.

930
01:07:02,399 --> 01:07:03,651
Doris.

931
01:07:07,071 --> 01:07:09,657
This is Doris.
Her brother-in-law owns this diner.

932
01:07:09,907 --> 01:07:13,577
She's worked here since she was 17.
She wants to see Paris...

933
01:07:13,786 --> 01:07:14,995
...before she dies.

934
01:07:15,204 --> 01:07:16,163
Boy, would I!

935
01:07:16,372 --> 01:07:19,041
- What are you doing?
- Debbie and her fiancé.

936
01:07:19,291 --> 01:07:20,542
Do I know you?

937
01:07:20,751 --> 01:07:23,629
They're supposed to get married.
She's having second thoughts.

938
01:07:23,879 --> 01:07:25,047
What?

939
01:07:25,297 --> 01:07:26,423
Lovely ring.

940
01:07:26,674 --> 01:07:31,512
Bill's been a waiter three years,
since he left Penn State to work.

941
01:07:31,762 --> 01:07:34,848
He likes the town,
paints toy soldiers and he's gay.

942
01:07:35,057 --> 01:07:36,100
I am.

943
01:07:36,725 --> 01:07:39,478
Gus hates it here,
wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.

944
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:42,273
I could've retired
on half pay after 20 years.

945
01:07:42,523 --> 01:07:44,358
Excuse me. Is this a trick?

946
01:07:44,608 --> 01:07:48,445
Maybe the real God uses tricks.
Maybe he's not omnipotent...

947
01:07:48,696 --> 01:07:50,614
...he just knows everything.

948
01:07:50,864 --> 01:07:52,199
- Who's that?
- Tom.

949
01:07:52,449 --> 01:07:54,451
He worked in the coal mine
till it closed.

950
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:55,828
- And her?
- Alice.

951
01:07:56,078 --> 01:07:58,622
Came from Ireland when she
was a baby. Lived in Erie.

952
01:07:58,872 --> 01:07:59,707
He's right.

953
01:07:59,915 --> 01:08:01,333
- And her?
- Nancy.

954
01:08:01,584 --> 01:08:05,546
Works in a shop, makes noises like
a chipmunk when she gets excited.

955
01:08:05,796 --> 01:08:07,506
- It's true.
- How do you know this?

956
01:08:07,756 --> 01:08:09,466
I told you, I know everything.

957
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:12,595
In five seconds, a waiter
will drop a tray.

958
01:08:12,803 --> 01:08:15,556
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- This is nuts.

959
01:08:17,892 --> 01:08:20,311
- Okay?
- Okay, that's enough.

960
01:08:21,353 --> 01:08:23,564
What about me?
Do you know me too?

961
01:08:23,814 --> 01:08:28,027
I know all about you. You hope
for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

962
01:08:28,235 --> 01:08:30,654
Well, everyone knows that.

963
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:33,616
You like boats but not the ocean.

964
01:08:34,033 --> 01:08:37,411
You go to a lake in the summer
with your family.

965
01:08:37,661 --> 01:08:41,582
There's a dock and a boathouse
with boards missing from the roof...

966
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:45,210
...and a place you used to
crawl underneath to be alone.

967
01:08:45,836 --> 01:08:49,089
You're a sucker for
French poetry and rhinestones.

968
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:51,216
You're very generous.

969
01:08:51,467 --> 01:08:53,969
You're kind to strangers
and children.

970
01:08:54,511 --> 01:08:57,348
When you stand in the snow
you look like an angel.

971
01:08:57,806 --> 01:08:59,350
How are you doing this?

972
01:09:00,434 --> 01:09:03,395
I told you. I wake up every day.

973
01:09:03,646 --> 01:09:05,314
Right here.

974
01:09:05,522 --> 01:09:08,943
Right in Punxsutawney.
And it's always February 2nd.

975
01:09:09,944 --> 01:09:12,446
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

976
01:09:13,155 --> 01:09:16,242
If you still can't believe me, listen:

977
01:09:16,492 --> 01:09:18,494
In 10 seconds...

978
01:09:18,994 --> 01:09:22,456
...Larry is going to come
and take you away from me.

979
01:09:22,706 --> 01:09:24,541
But you can't let him.

980
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:28,587
Please believe me.
You've got to believe me.

981
01:09:33,676 --> 01:09:37,680
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

982
01:09:38,305 --> 01:09:39,557
What's that?

983
01:09:40,474 --> 01:09:42,893
"... to stay ahead of the weather."

984
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:52,486
Maybe it really is happening.
How else could you know so much?

985
01:09:52,695 --> 01:09:55,197
There is no way.
I'm not that smart.

986
01:09:56,323 --> 01:09:58,576
Maybe I should
spend the day with you...

987
01:09:58,826 --> 01:10:02,288
...as an objective witness,
just to see what happens.

988
01:10:02,538 --> 01:10:04,999
This sounds like a science project.

989
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:07,334
Concentrate.

990
01:10:07,585 --> 01:10:09,378
You got to want it.

991
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:11,922
You got to want it, Rita.

992
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:16,260
Come on. It's more
in the wrist than the fingers.

993
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,395
Be the hat. Come on, go.

994
01:10:26,645 --> 01:10:29,607
- It'd take me a year to get good.
- Six months.

995
01:10:29,857 --> 01:10:33,110
Four to five hours a day,
and you'd be an expert.

996
01:10:33,611 --> 01:10:37,239
- Is this what you do with eternity?
- Now you know.

997
01:10:38,657 --> 01:10:40,701
That's not the worst part.

998
01:10:40,951 --> 01:10:42,369
What's the worst part?

999
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:44,622
The worst part is that...

1000
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:47,374
...tomorrow you'll have
forgotten all about this...

1001
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:49,835
...and you'll treat me
like a jerk again.

1002
01:10:50,961 --> 01:10:52,421
I am a jerk.

1003
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:54,465
No, you're not.

1004
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,345
It doesn't make any difference.
I've killed myself so many times...

1005
01:10:59,595 --> 01:11:01,305
...I don't even exist anymore.

1006
01:11:01,889 --> 01:11:04,642
Sometimes I wish I had
a thousand lifetimes.

1007
01:11:05,226 --> 01:11:08,229
I don't know.
Maybe it's not a curse.

1008
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:11,106
It just depends
on how you look at it.

1009
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:14,860
Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!

1010
01:11:18,155 --> 01:11:21,325
I want you to know it's been
a really nice day for me.

1011
01:11:21,575 --> 01:11:22,451
Me too.

1012
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,869
And maybe...

1013
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:27,790
...if it's not too boring,
we can do it again sometime.

1014
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,458
I hope so.

1015
01:11:41,637 --> 01:11:43,430
You're still here?

1016
01:11:45,808 --> 01:11:48,644
I thought you were supposed
to disappear. Or I was.

1017
01:11:48,894 --> 01:11:50,563
Not until 6.

1018
01:11:51,438 --> 01:11:52,856
You rat!

1019
01:11:53,107 --> 01:11:54,942
I never said midnight.

1020
01:11:55,276 --> 01:11:57,736
You knew I was waiting for midnight.

1021
01:11:58,529 --> 01:11:59,947
Are you going to leave?

1022
01:12:01,782 --> 01:12:03,075
No.

1023
01:12:03,742 --> 01:12:04,868
Good.

1024
01:12:15,546 --> 01:12:17,214
I'm sorry.

1025
01:12:18,716 --> 01:12:20,968
It's all right.
You can fall asleep.

1026
01:12:21,969 --> 01:12:24,305
I promise I won't touch you.

1027
01:12:25,014 --> 01:12:26,265
Much.

1028
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,352
It's all right. I'm not tired.

1029
01:12:31,186 --> 01:12:32,855
What were you saying?

1030
01:12:34,273 --> 01:12:37,568
I think the last thing
that you heard was:

1031
01:12:37,818 --> 01:12:40,487
"Only God could make a tree."

1032
01:12:40,738 --> 01:12:41,822
Really?

1033
01:13:19,985 --> 01:13:22,279
What I wanted to say was...

1034
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:26,158
...I think you are the kindest...

1035
01:13:26,408 --> 01:13:28,953
...sweetest, prettiest person...

1036
01:13:29,453 --> 01:13:31,455
...l've ever met in my life.

1037
01:13:32,998 --> 01:13:35,209
I've never seen anyone...

1038
01:13:35,834 --> 01:13:38,337
...that's nicer to people
than you are.

1039
01:13:51,308 --> 01:13:53,352
And the first time I saw you...

1040
01:13:54,436 --> 01:13:56,689
...something happened to me.

1041
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:00,067
I never told you...

1042
01:14:03,445 --> 01:14:05,864
...but I knew I wanted
to hold you...

1043
01:14:06,073 --> 01:14:07,950
...as hard as I could.

1044
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:23,382
I don't deserve someone like you.

1045
01:14:27,219 --> 01:14:29,013
But if I ever could...

1046
01:14:30,472 --> 01:14:32,558
...I swear I would love you...

1047
01:14:32,933 --> 01:14:35,060
...for the rest of my life.

1048
01:14:39,648 --> 01:14:41,525
Did you say something?

1049
01:14:47,239 --> 01:14:48,824
Good night, Rita.

1050
01:14:50,034 --> 01:14:51,619
Good night, Phil.

1051
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,897
<i>Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.</i>

1052
01:15:20,105 --> 01:15:23,150
<i>- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day.</i>

1053
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:25,653
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

1054
01:16:01,063 --> 01:16:03,524
Who wants coffee?
Get it while it's hot.

1055
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,568
Thanks, Phil.

1056
01:16:05,776 --> 01:16:06,610
Larry?

1057
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:08,946
Skim milk, two sugar.

1058
01:16:09,196 --> 01:16:10,531
Thanks, Phil.

1059
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:11,907
Pastry?

1060
01:16:12,157 --> 01:16:13,325
We're setting up.

1061
01:16:13,534 --> 01:16:15,327
Pastry, Larry?
Take your pick.

1062
01:16:16,579 --> 01:16:18,622
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.

1063
01:16:19,123 --> 01:16:22,293
I talked with Buster Green,
the head groundhog honcho.

1064
01:16:22,543 --> 01:16:25,337
He said if we set up here
we'll get a better shot.

1065
01:16:25,796 --> 01:16:28,048
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

1066
01:16:28,382 --> 01:16:29,592
Larry?

1067
01:16:30,884 --> 01:16:32,803
Yeah. Let's go for it.

1068
01:16:33,053 --> 01:16:34,096
Good work, Phil.

1069
01:16:34,763 --> 01:16:38,100
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Let me give you a hand.

1070
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,479
No, no. You got your coffee.
I'll get it.

1071
01:16:43,772 --> 01:16:45,649
We never talk.
Do you have kids?

1072
01:17:20,434 --> 01:17:22,269
I'd like a piano lesson.

1073
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:26,565
I'm with a student. But if you
want to come back tomorrow...

1074
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:30,027
I kind of want to get started.
I can give you $1000.

1075
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:33,697
Come on in.

1076
01:17:53,259 --> 01:17:55,302
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

1077
01:17:55,511 --> 01:17:57,555
<i>Buon giorno, signore!</i>

1078
01:17:58,556 --> 01:18:01,016
Think it'll be an early spring?

1079
01:18:01,267 --> 01:18:03,644
<i>Winter, slumbering in the open air</i>

1080
01:18:03,894 --> 01:18:05,521
<i>Wears on his smiling face...</i>

1081
01:18:05,771 --> 01:18:07,982
<i>... a dream of spring</i>

1082
01:18:08,232 --> 01:18:09,275
Ciao!

1083
01:18:10,568 --> 01:18:11,777
Ciao!

1084
01:18:49,899 --> 01:18:51,150
How does she look?

1085
01:18:51,442 --> 01:18:52,526
Great.

1086
01:18:53,027 --> 01:18:53,944
Thank you.

1087
01:18:54,153 --> 01:18:57,615
- Did you know he could ice sculpt?
- No.

1088
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:14,882
Not bad. You say
this is your first lesson?

1089
01:19:15,841 --> 01:19:19,094
Yes, but my father
was a piano mover, so...

1090
01:19:25,017 --> 01:19:29,521
- Phil Connors, I thought it was you.
- Ned Ryerson.

1091
01:19:31,232 --> 01:19:33,776
I have missed you so much.

1092
01:19:38,155 --> 01:19:41,700
I don't know where you're headed,
but can you call in sick?

1093
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,039
I got to get going.

1094
01:19:47,915 --> 01:19:49,959
It's good to see you, Phil.

1095
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:09,520
Hello, father.

1096
01:20:10,271 --> 01:20:11,981
Let's get you someplace warm.

1097
01:20:13,816 --> 01:20:15,192
Remember me?

1098
01:20:22,032 --> 01:20:23,742
You brought the old man in?

1099
01:20:23,951 --> 01:20:24,994
How is he?

1100
01:20:25,703 --> 01:20:27,705
He just passed away.

1101
01:20:29,456 --> 01:20:32,501
- What did he die of?
- He was just old.

1102
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:34,587
It was just his time.

1103
01:20:37,339 --> 01:20:40,342
- I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
- Sir!

1104
01:20:40,718 --> 01:20:42,344
You can't come in here.

1105
01:20:42,595 --> 01:20:45,222
Sir, this is a restricted area.

1106
01:20:54,398 --> 01:20:56,066
Where's the chart?

1107
01:20:56,567 --> 01:20:58,903
Sometimes people just die.

1108
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:01,280
Not today.

1109
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:15,878
Gets hard down there at the bottom.

1110
01:21:18,797 --> 01:21:20,007
Here you go.

1111
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:21,467
Thank you.

1112
01:21:25,888 --> 01:21:26,972
Come on, dad.

1113
01:21:27,223 --> 01:21:28,599
Come on, pop.

1114
01:21:30,559 --> 01:21:32,353
Come on. Come on, breathe.

1115
01:21:32,603 --> 01:21:35,272
Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop!

1116
01:22:01,006 --> 01:22:03,676
When Chekhov saw the long winter...

1117
01:22:04,134 --> 01:22:07,513
...he saw a winter bleak
and dark and bereft of hope.

1118
01:22:07,763 --> 01:22:12,434
Yet we know winter is just
another step in the cycle of life.

1119
01:22:12,685 --> 01:22:16,355
But standing here among
the people of Punxsutawney...

1120
01:22:16,605 --> 01:22:19,400
...and basking in the warmth
of their hearths and hearts...

1121
01:22:20,484 --> 01:22:22,778
...I couldn't imagine a better fate...

1122
01:22:22,987 --> 01:22:25,948
...than a long and lustrous winter.

1123
01:22:26,198 --> 01:22:28,993
From Punxsutawney, it's Phil Connors.

1124
01:22:29,243 --> 01:22:30,536
So long.

1125
01:22:32,413 --> 01:22:34,123
Nice speech. Very nice.

1126
01:22:34,373 --> 01:22:35,541
Thank you.

1127
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:40,129
- How was that for you two?
- My man, you touched me.

1128
01:22:40,379 --> 01:22:42,047
- Thanks, Larry.
- Thank you.

1129
01:22:43,424 --> 01:22:44,341
I got to go.

1130
01:22:45,926 --> 01:22:49,972
That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatile.

1131
01:22:50,222 --> 01:22:51,891
I surprise myself sometimes.

1132
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:54,101
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1133
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:58,272
I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?
I've got some errands.

1134
01:23:02,026 --> 01:23:03,944
Errands? What errands?

1135
01:23:04,194 --> 01:23:06,405
I thought we were going back.

1136
01:23:24,048 --> 01:23:26,884
What do you say?
What do you say?

1137
01:23:27,092 --> 01:23:29,970
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!

1138
01:23:30,679 --> 01:23:32,306
I'll see you tomorrow...

1139
01:23:32,556 --> 01:23:33,641
...maybe.

1140
01:23:41,357 --> 01:23:43,692
You totaled it.

1141
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:48,030
- It's only a flat tire.
- What are we going to do?

1142
01:23:49,406 --> 01:23:52,826
- It's an earthquake!
- It's not an earthquake.

1143
01:23:53,035 --> 01:23:54,036
What is it?

1144
01:23:57,623 --> 01:23:59,708
Thank you, young man.

1145
01:24:00,834 --> 01:24:03,212
It's nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.

1146
01:24:03,462 --> 01:24:06,090
Just be comfortable.
It'll be a minute.

1147
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:07,550
Who is that?

1148
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,553
He must be from the motor club.

1149
01:24:11,804 --> 01:24:14,473
He's having a heart attack!
Do something!

1150
01:24:14,723 --> 01:24:18,811
Call 411, an ambulance, a lawyer,
doctor, anything!

1151
01:24:26,068 --> 01:24:27,611
I think that did it.

1152
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:34,368
If you're going to eat steak,
get sharper teeth.

1153
01:24:34,618 --> 01:24:36,954
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

1154
01:24:37,538 --> 01:24:38,872
Who was that?

1155
01:24:39,081 --> 01:24:41,792
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

1156
01:24:42,042 --> 01:24:42,918
Eat, eat!

1157
01:24:47,339 --> 01:24:48,883
<i>People don't understand...</i>

1158
01:24:49,091 --> 01:24:51,886
...what's involved.
This is an art form.

1159
01:24:52,136 --> 01:24:54,597
I think most people just think...

1160
01:24:54,847 --> 01:24:58,017
...that I hold a camera
and point it at stuff.

1161
01:24:58,267 --> 01:25:00,561
There's a lot more to it than that.

1162
01:25:02,605 --> 01:25:06,108
Would you be interested in seeing
the inside of a van?

1163
01:25:06,317 --> 01:25:09,612
You know, I really have to
get back to the party.

1164
01:25:09,862 --> 01:25:11,572
Great idea.
I'll go with you.

1165
01:25:11,822 --> 01:25:14,074
Let me just drop a tip here.

1166
01:25:20,122 --> 01:25:21,624
Hi! How are you?

1167
01:25:21,874 --> 01:25:23,667
Rita, this is Nancy.

1168
01:25:24,793 --> 01:25:27,046
We were going to the party.
You going?

1169
01:25:27,254 --> 01:25:29,882
Sounds like fun.
Maybe we should call Phil.

1170
01:25:30,966 --> 01:25:33,052
I think he's already in there.

1171
01:27:29,752 --> 01:27:31,003
Isn't he good?

1172
01:27:31,253 --> 01:27:32,379
He's great!

1173
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:34,256
He's my student.

1174
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:38,761
I'm so proud.

1175
01:27:39,929 --> 01:27:41,138
Thank you.

1176
01:27:42,306 --> 01:27:44,350
Hello, welcome to our party.

1177
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,852
I didn't know you could
play like that.

1178
01:27:47,102 --> 01:27:48,812
I'm versatile.

1179
01:27:56,195 --> 01:27:59,240
It's that nice young man
from the motor club.

1180
01:27:59,448 --> 01:28:00,950
Thank you again.

1181
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,618
It's nothing, ladies.

1182
01:28:02,868 --> 01:28:06,121
He's the fastest jack
in Jefferson County.

1183
01:28:08,582 --> 01:28:10,209
What was that all about?

1184
01:28:10,459 --> 01:28:13,545
Don't know. They've been
hitting on me all night.

1185
01:28:14,421 --> 01:28:15,798
There you are!

1186
01:28:17,758 --> 01:28:20,970
I never thanked you properly
for what you did.

1187
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:23,264
He would've choked for sure.

1188
01:28:23,514 --> 01:28:27,226
He may have. He was trying
to swallow a whole cow.

1189
01:28:27,476 --> 01:28:28,686
I owe you one, buddy.

1190
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:32,064
Hang on to him, dear.
He's a real find.

1191
01:28:34,483 --> 01:28:36,193
What did you do today?

1192
01:28:36,443 --> 01:28:38,028
Same old, same old.

1193
01:28:43,784 --> 01:28:45,327
Excuse me, Mr. Connors.

1194
01:28:45,536 --> 01:28:47,121
Fred, how was the wedding?

1195
01:28:47,371 --> 01:28:50,374
Thank you for making
Debbie go through with it.

1196
01:28:50,624 --> 01:28:53,669
All I did was fan her flame
of passion for you.

1197
01:28:53,919 --> 01:28:55,129
You are the best.

1198
01:28:55,379 --> 01:28:56,422
No, you are.

1199
01:28:56,672 --> 01:28:59,842
Rita, this is
Debbie and Fred Kleiser.

1200
01:29:00,092 --> 01:29:03,929
- Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
- What is this?

1201
01:29:04,388 --> 01:29:06,223
No way!

1202
01:29:06,473 --> 01:29:09,602
WrestleMania!
No way!

1203
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:13,522
How'd you know?
We'll be in Pittsburgh anyway!

1204
01:29:13,772 --> 01:29:15,608
Thank you. You're a real pal.

1205
01:29:15,858 --> 01:29:17,735
Oh, this is the best.

1206
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:23,949
I don't understand.

1207
01:29:24,199 --> 01:29:25,910
I guess not.

1208
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:29,163
How does everyone know you?
You come once a year.

1209
01:29:29,413 --> 01:29:31,248
You're the most popular
person in town.

1210
01:29:31,498 --> 01:29:33,709
Excuse me, Dr. Connors?

1211
01:29:33,918 --> 01:29:36,837
I want to thank you
for fixing Felix's back.

1212
01:29:37,046 --> 01:29:39,131
He can help around the house again.

1213
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,842
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that, Felix.

1214
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,846
Dr. Connors?

1215
01:29:46,222 --> 01:29:48,557
It's kind of an honorary title.

1216
01:29:48,807 --> 01:29:50,392
What is going on?

1217
01:29:50,601 --> 01:29:51,644
I really don't know.

1218
01:29:51,894 --> 01:29:54,355
There is something
going on with you.

1219
01:29:54,939 --> 01:29:56,899
You want the long or short version?

1220
01:29:57,149 --> 01:29:59,985
Let's start with the short
and go from there.

1221
01:30:05,783 --> 01:30:07,785
Okay, folks, attention.

1222
01:30:08,577 --> 01:30:11,705
Time for the bachelor auction.
You know the rules.

1223
01:30:11,956 --> 01:30:14,416
All the eligible bachelors
come in front.

1224
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:16,168
And you ladies...

1225
01:30:16,418 --> 01:30:17,753
...you bid on them!

1226
01:30:18,003 --> 01:30:20,047
Do whatever you want with them...

1227
01:30:20,297 --> 01:30:21,882
...no questions asked!

1228
01:30:22,132 --> 01:30:25,219
I don't want to know about it,
as long as it's legal.

1229
01:30:25,302 --> 01:30:29,807
Get out your pocketbooks,
and remember it's all for charity.

1230
01:30:31,976 --> 01:30:33,561
What are you doing down here?

1231
01:30:33,811 --> 01:30:35,312
Go on, get up there.

1232
01:30:35,521 --> 01:30:38,607
I got 10 bucks
that says you're mine.

1233
01:30:39,024 --> 01:30:40,943
Buster, I got your first victim.

1234
01:30:41,151 --> 01:30:43,821
Phil Connors, come on up here!

1235
01:30:48,867 --> 01:30:52,204
All right! Now, what am I bid
for this fine specimen?

1236
01:30:52,496 --> 01:30:53,914
Five dollars!

1237
01:30:54,123 --> 01:30:56,083

1239
01:30:57,835 --> 01:30:59,044

Forty-five!

1244
01:31:06,302 --> 01:31:07,344

1247
01:31:09,972 --> 01:31:11,640
I'm bid $60.
Do I hear more?

1248
01:31:15,436 --> 01:31:18,606
$339.88.

1249
01:31:22,526 --> 01:31:26,363
We won't accept any more bids.
I think that's sold...

1250
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:30,284
...to the little lady for $339.88!

1251
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:32,786
Congratulations!

1252
01:31:40,878 --> 01:31:42,796
Okay, bachelors, who's next?

1253
01:31:53,224 --> 01:31:56,518
All right! Now, what am I
bid for this guy?

1254
01:31:56,727 --> 01:31:58,562
Do I hear a buck and a half?

1255
01:31:58,854 --> 01:32:00,105
Anybody?

1256
01:32:00,981 --> 01:32:02,024
75 cents?

1257
01:32:02,233 --> 01:32:04,026
I bid two bits!

1258
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:07,029
Sold to the lady for 25 cents.

1259
01:32:07,238 --> 01:32:08,781
I got him!

1260
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:19,750
Phil Connors,
I thought that was you.

1261
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,461
This is Ned Ryerson,
my new insurance agent.

1262
01:32:22,711 --> 01:32:23,963
I'll say.

1263
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:27,132
I haven't seen him for 20 years.

1264
01:32:27,383 --> 01:32:32,429
He comes up and buys whole life,
term, fire, auto, dental, health...

1265
01:32:32,638 --> 01:32:35,558
...with the optional death
and dismemberment plan.

1266
01:32:35,808 --> 01:32:37,977
This is the best day of my life.

1267
01:32:38,227 --> 01:32:40,354
- Mine too.
- Mine too.

1268
01:32:40,563 --> 01:32:41,814
Where are we going?

1269
01:32:42,064 --> 01:32:43,774
Let's not spoil it.

1270
01:32:45,317 --> 01:32:47,945
Let's not...
I got that.

1271
01:32:50,864 --> 01:32:52,283
Why can't I look?

1272
01:32:52,741 --> 01:32:54,577
Because you bother me a lot.

1273
01:32:54,868 --> 01:32:56,245
I'm getting cold.

1274
01:32:56,453 --> 01:32:58,080
How long do I have to sit here?

1275
01:32:58,706 --> 01:33:01,834
I'm giving you your money's worth.
You paid top dollar for me.

1276
01:33:02,418 --> 01:33:04,753
Well, I think you were a bargain.

1277
01:33:05,588 --> 01:33:07,715
Sweet of you to say.
You're right.

1278
01:33:10,467 --> 01:33:11,886
Is it finished yet?

1279
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:15,639
I still have to put
cherry syrup on the top...

1280
01:33:15,848 --> 01:33:16,891
...then we can eat it.

1281
01:33:17,141 --> 01:33:19,810
Come on, Phil.
I'm freezing!

1282
01:33:20,019 --> 01:33:21,687
One second, one second.

1283
01:33:21,937 --> 01:33:23,731
Let me turn it in the light.

1284
01:33:29,236 --> 01:33:30,738
It's amazing.

1285
01:33:31,488 --> 01:33:32,740
It's beautiful.

1286
01:33:37,036 --> 01:33:38,412
How did you do that?

1287
01:33:39,246 --> 01:33:43,042
I know your face so well,
I could do it with my eyes closed.

1288
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:49,006
It's lovely.

1289
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:51,592
I don't know what to say.

1290
01:33:52,801 --> 01:33:54,011
I do.

1291
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:58,390
No matter what happens tomorrow...

1292
01:33:58,641 --> 01:34:00,517
...or for the rest of my life...

1293
01:34:00,726 --> 01:34:02,436
...l'm happy now...

1294
01:34:03,646 --> 01:34:05,231
...because I love you.

1295
01:34:06,148 --> 01:34:07,942
I think I'm happy too.

1296
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:07,793
<i>Please. Not again.</i>

1297
01:35:08,002 --> 01:35:09,879
<i>- That's a great song.
- It's not.</i>

1298
01:35:10,129 --> 01:35:12,172
<i>Don't listen to this man...</i>

1299
01:35:12,756 --> 01:35:15,175
It's too early.

1300
01:35:25,895 --> 01:35:27,688
Something is different.

1301
01:35:28,314 --> 01:35:29,565
Good or bad?

1302
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:32,234
Anything different is good.

1303
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:36,989
But this could be real good.

1304
01:35:41,869 --> 01:35:43,287
Why are you here?

1305
01:35:43,746 --> 01:35:45,831
I bought you.
I own you.

1306
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:49,919
But why are you still here?

1307
01:35:50,169 --> 01:35:53,255
You said, "Stay,"
so I stayed.

1308
01:35:55,925 --> 01:35:57,968
I said, "Stay,"
so you stayed.

1309
01:35:58,219 --> 01:36:00,763
I can't even make a collie stay.

1310
01:36:02,932 --> 01:36:04,934
I got to check something.

1311
01:36:05,726 --> 01:36:07,102
Stay.

1312
01:36:07,519 --> 01:36:08,646
Stay.

1313
01:36:14,276 --> 01:36:15,569
They're gone!

1314
01:36:16,487 --> 01:36:18,072
They're all gone.

1315
01:36:20,157 --> 01:36:22,868
- Do you know what today is?
- No, what?

1316
01:36:24,203 --> 01:36:26,205
Today is tomorrow.

1317
01:36:26,789 --> 01:36:28,123
It happened.

1318
01:36:30,376 --> 01:36:32,628
- You're here.
- I'm here.

1319
01:36:36,799 --> 01:36:41,428
Why weren't you like this last night?
You just fell asleep.

1320
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,058
It was the end of a very long day.

1321
01:36:49,144 --> 01:36:52,940
Is there anything I can do
for you today?

1322
01:36:53,816 --> 01:36:56,443
I'm sure I can think of something.

1323
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,562
It's so beautiful!

1324
01:37:42,197 --> 01:37:43,824
Let's live here.

1325
01:37:54,293 --> 01:37:56,337
We'll rent to start.

1326
01:41:00,688 --> 01:41:01,730
