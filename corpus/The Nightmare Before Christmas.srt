1
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:30,178
'Twas a long time ago,
longer now than it seems...

2
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:33,019
in a place that perhaps
you've seen in your dreams.

3
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:35,739
For the story that you
are about to be told...

4
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:38,659
took place
in the holiday worlds of old.

5
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:42,020
Now, you've probably wondered
where holidays come from.

6
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,060
If you haven't,
I'd say it's time you begun!

7
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:03,462
Boys and girls
of every age

8
00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:06,182
Wouldn't you like to see
something strange

9
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:08,943
Come with us
and you will see

10
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:11,663
This our town
of Halloween

11
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,423
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

12
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,184
Pumpkins scream
in the dead of night

13
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,944
This is Halloween
Everybody make a scene

14
00:01:20,104 --> 00:01:22,744
Trick-or-treat till the
neighbor's gonna die of fright

15
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:25,465
It's our town
Everybody scream

16
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,745
In this town of Halloween

17
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:30,305
I am the one hiding
under your bed

18
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,146
Teeth ground sharp
and eyes glowing red

19
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:35,866
I am the one hiding
under your stairs

20
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:38,786
Fingers like snakes
and spiders in my hair

21
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:41,506
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

22
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,307
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

23
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:48,387
In this town we call home

24
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:51,108
Everyone hail
to the pumpkin song

25
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:53,948
In this town
Don't we love it now

26
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:56,708
Everybody's waiting
for the next surprise

27
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:59,428
'Round that corner, man
Hiding in the trash can

28
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:02,789
- Something's waiting now
to pounce and how you'll
- Scream

29
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:05,029
- This is Halloween
- Red and black
- And slimy green

30
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,669
- Aren't you scared
- Well, that's just fine

31
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,510
Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice

32
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,230
Ride with the moon
in the dead of night

33
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,190
Everybody scream
Everybody scream

34
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,151
In our town of Halloween

35
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:20,871
I am the clown
with a tear-away face

36
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:23,591
Here in a flash
and gone without a trace

37
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:26,392
I am the who
when you call who's there

38
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:29,152
I am the wind blowing
through your hair

39
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:31,872
I am the shadow
on the moon at night

40
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:34,552
Filling your dreams
to the brim with fright

41
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:37,393
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

42
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:40,153
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

43
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:45,634
Tender lumplings everywhere

44
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:48,514
Life's no fun
without a good scare

45
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:51,234
- That's our job
- But we're not mean

46
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:53,995
In our town of Halloween

47
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:56,755
In this town
Don't we love it now

48
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:59,475
Everyone's waiting
for the next surprise

49
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:01,916
Skeleton Jack
might catch you in the back

50
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:05,236
And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin

51
00:03:05,396 --> 00:03:07,516
This is Halloween
Everybody scream

52
00:03:07,676 --> 00:03:10,476
Won't you please make way
for a very special guy

53
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:13,237
Our man Jack is king
of the pumpkin patch

54
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:15,997
Everyone hail
to the Pumpkin King now

55
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:18,837
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

56
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:21,598
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

57
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:25,718
In this town we call home

58
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:28,479
Everyone hail
to the pumpkin song

59
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,039
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween

60
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,999
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween

61
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,319
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween

62
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,520
La, la, la, la, la, la
Whee

63
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:54,241
- It's over!
- We did it!

64
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,682
- Wasn't it terrifying?
- What a night!

65
00:03:57,842 --> 00:03:59,882
Great Halloween, everybody.

66
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:04,323
I believe it was our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.

67
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:06,283
No! Thanks to you, Jack.

68
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:08,323
Without your
brilliant leadership--

69
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:12,163
- Not at all, Mayor.
- You're such a scream, Jack.

70
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:17,004
- You're a witch's fondest dream.
- You made walls fall, Jack.

71
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:21,284
Walls fall? You made
the very mountains crack, Jack.

72
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:26,205
- The deadly nightshade
you slipped me wore off, Sally.
- Let go!

73
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:30,726
- You're not ready
for so much excitement.
- Yes, I am!

74
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:33,806
- You're coming with me!
- No, I'm not!

75
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:40,087
Come back here, you foolish--

76
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,567
Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh.

77
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:47,207
Ooh, Jack, you made
wounds ooze and flesh crawl.

78
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:51,168
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much!

79
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:56,048
Hold it. We haven't given out
the prizes yet.

80
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,889
Our first award
goes to the vampires...

81
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,649
for most blood drained
in a single evening.

82
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,849
Our second and
honorable mention...

83
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,530
goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon leeches.

84
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:17,971
Nice work, Bone Daddy.

85
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:21,131
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year...

86
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,012
and the year before that,
and the year before that.

87
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:07,016
There are few who deny
at what I do I am the best

88
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:11,137
For my talents
are renowned far and wide

89
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:15,377
When it comes to surprises
in the moonlit night

90
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:19,378
I excel without ever even trying

91
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:21,578
With the slightest little effort

92
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:23,778
Of my ghost-like charms

93
00:06:23,938 --> 00:06:27,819
I have seen grown men
give out a shriek

94
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,179
With a wave of my hand
and a well-placed moan

95
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:36,340
I have swept the very bravest
off their feet

96
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,140
Yet year after year

97
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,700
It's the same routine

98
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,501
And I grow so weary
of the sound of screams

99
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:51,261
And l, Jack
the Pumpkin King

100
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:56,622
Have grown so tired
of the same old thing

101
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:02,263
Oh, somewhere deep

102
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,183
Inside of these bones

103
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:08,143
An emptiness

104
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,024
Began to grow

105
00:07:11,184 --> 00:07:14,464
There's something out there

106
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:17,024
Far from my home

107
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:20,345
A longing that

108
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:25,385
I've never known

109
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:28,906
I'm the master of fright

110
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,826
And a demon of light

111
00:07:30,986 --> 00:07:34,986
And I'll scare you
right out of your pants

112
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:39,307
To a guy in Kentucky
I'm Mr. Unlucky

113
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:43,347
And I'm known throughout
England and France

114
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:47,508
And since I am dead
I can take off my head

115
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,628
To recite Shakespearean quotations

116
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:56,069
No animal nor man
can scream like I can

117
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,269
With the fury
of my recitations

118
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:02,989
But who here

119
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:05,310
Would ever understand

120
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,110
That the Pumpkin King
with the skeleton grin

121
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,071
Would tire of his crown
lf they only understood

122
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:17,311
He'd give it all up

123
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:22,352
If he only could

124
00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:25,632
Oh, there's an empty

125
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:28,232
Place in my bones

126
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:31,193
That calls out for

127
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:34,153
Something unknown

128
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,193
The fame and praise

129
00:08:37,353 --> 00:08:40,074
Come year after year

130
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:43,914
Does nothing for

131
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:49,635
These empty tears

132
00:08:55,555 --> 00:08:57,676
Jack.

133
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,516
I know how you feel.

134
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:22,998
Sally!

135
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,159
You've come back.

136
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:30,839
- I had to.
- For this!

137
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,480
- Yes.
- Shall we, then?

138
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:52,122
That's twice this month
you've slipped deadly nightshade
into my tea and run off.

139
00:09:52,282 --> 00:09:55,042
- Three times.
- You're mine, you know!

140
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:59,283
I made you with my own hands.

141
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:02,003
You can make other creations.

142
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:04,763
I'm restless. I can't help it.

143
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:08,244
It's a phase, my dear. It'll pass.

144
00:10:08,404 --> 00:10:11,764
We need to be patient, that's all.

145
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:14,404
But I don't want to be patient.

146
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:19,485
No, Zero, not now.

147
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:22,085
I'm not in the mood.

148
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:26,726
All right.

149
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:28,926
Here you go, boy.

150
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:49,488
Mornin', gents!

151
00:11:09,971 --> 00:11:12,691
Jack, you home?

152
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:25,132
Jack, I've got the plans
for next Halloween.

153
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:29,173
I need to go over them with you
so we can get started.

154
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,413
Jack, please! I'm only
an elected official here.

155
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:35,893
I can't make decisions by myself.

156
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:38,814
Jack, answer me!

157
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:45,495
- Huh?
- He's not home.

158
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:48,575
- Where is he?
- He hasn't been home all night.

159
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:01,176
Where are we?

160
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:09,577
It's someplace new!

161
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:19,378
What is this?

162
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:04,383
Whoa-oa-oa!

163
00:13:06,824 --> 00:13:11,264
Whoa!

164
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:55,389
What's this, what's this
There's color everywhere

165
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:57,509
What's this
There's white things in the air

166
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:00,110
What's this, I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming

167
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,110
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this

168
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,471
What's this, what's this
There's something very wrong

169
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:10,191
What's this, there's people
singing songs, what's this

170
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:13,551
The streets are lined
with little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy

171
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:16,672
Have I possibly gone daffy
What is this

172
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:19,592
What's this

173
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:22,312
There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads

174
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:25,273
They're busy building toys
and absolutely no one's dead

175
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:28,193
There's frost in every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes

176
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:30,113
And in my bones
I feel the warmth

177
00:14:30,273 --> 00:14:33,994
That's coming from inside

178
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:36,834
Oh, look, what's this
They're hanging mistletoe

179
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:39,634
They kiss, why that looks
so unique, inspired

180
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:41,554
They're gathering around
to hear a story

181
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,275
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this

182
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:49,715
What's this in here
They've got a little tree, how queer

183
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,595
And who would ever think
And why

184
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,516
They're covering it
with tiny little things

185
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:56,556
They've got electric lights on strings
and there's a smile on everyone

186
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:59,316
So now correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun, this looks like fun

187
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:01,797
Oh, could it be I got my wish
What's this

188
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:06,837
Oh my, what now
The children are asleep

189
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:08,877
But look
There's nothing underneath

190
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:11,878
No ghouls, no witches here
to scream and scare them or ensnare them

191
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:17,158
Only little cozy things
secure inside their dreamland

192
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,879
What's this

193
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,639
The monsters are all missing
and the nightmares can't be found

194
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,480
And in their place there seems
to be good feeling all around

195
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,200
Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air

196
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,641
The smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere

197
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:40,241
The sights, the sounds
they're everywhere and all around

198
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:42,321
I've never felt so good before

199
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:45,882
This empty place
inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough

200
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:48,402
I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own

201
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:51,722
I've got to know, I've got to know
what is this place that I have found

202
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:54,523
What is this

203
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:01,843
Christmas Town?

204
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,604
Hmm.

205
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,124
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

206
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:10,964
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

207
00:16:11,124 --> 00:16:12,485
Hmm.

208
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:15,125
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.

209
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:17,285
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary.

210
00:16:17,445 --> 00:16:20,285
Stand aside. Coming through.

211
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:28,366
We've got to find Jack!

212
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:32,407
There's only 365 days left
till next Halloween!

213
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,287
Three sixty-four!

214
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:37,687
Is there anywhere
we've forgotten to check?

215
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:40,168
I looked in every mausoleum.

216
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:42,168
We opened the sarcophagi!

217
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:44,968
I tromped through
the pumpkin patch.

218
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,729
I peeked behind
the cyclops' eye.

219
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:50,209
I did! But he wasn't there.

220
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,929
It's time to sound the alarms!

221
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:24,253
Frog's breath
will overpower any odor.

222
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:33,934
Bitter!

223
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:38,814
Worm's wart. But where,
where is that worm's wart?

224
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:43,215
Sally? ls that soup ready yet?

225
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:47,295
Ah. Coming!

226
00:17:54,976 --> 00:17:56,736
Lunch!

227
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:01,097
Ah, what's that?

228
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:04,977
Worm's wart! Mmm!

229
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:07,698
And frog's breath?

230
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:11,778
Wh-What's wrong? l-l thought
you liked frog's breath.

231
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:15,298
Nothing's more suspicious
than frog's breath.

232
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:20,019
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.

233
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:22,819
I'm not hungry. Oops.

234
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:26,260
You want me to starve...

235
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,980
an old man like me,
who hardly has strength as it is.

236
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,901
Me, to whom you owe
your very life.

237
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:37,541
Oh, don't be silly.

238
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:43,502
Mmm! See? Scrumptious!

239
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:55,103
Did anyone think
to dredge the lake?

240
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:57,623
Oh, this morning.

241
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:02,944
- Hear that?
- Ah, what?
- Shh.

242
00:19:04,904 --> 00:19:06,664
Zero!

243
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:11,545
- Jack's back!
- Jack's back! Jack's back!

244
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:25,546
- Where have you been?
- Call a town meeting and I'll
tell everyone all about it.

245
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,467
- When?
- Immediately!

246
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:38,028
Town meeting! Town meeting!

247
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:42,428
Town meeting tonight!

248
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:47,709
Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!

249
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:07,311
Listen, everyone!

250
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:11,151
I want to tell you
about Christmas Town.

251
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:17,392
There were objects so peculiar
they were not to be believed

252
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:20,793
All around things
to tantalize my brain

253
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,113
It's a world unlike anything
I've ever seen

254
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:27,473
And as hard as I tried
I can't seem to describe

255
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:30,874
Like a most improbable dream

256
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:34,234
But you must believe
when I tell you this

257
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:39,515
It's as real as my skull
and it does exist

258
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:42,435
Here, let me show you.

259
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:46,355
Ooh!

260
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,876
This is a thing
called a present

261
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:50,836
The whole thing
starts with a box

262
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:53,316
- A box
- Is it steel
- Are there locks

263
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:56,637
- Is it filled with a pox
- A pox, how delightful, a pox

264
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,037
If you please.

265
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:00,637
Just a box with
bright colored paper

266
00:21:00,797 --> 00:21:03,197
And the whole thing's
topped with a bow

267
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:06,478
- A bow
- But why
- How ugly
- What's in it, what's in it

268
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:08,198
That's the point of the thing
Not to know

269
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:10,798
- It's a bat
- Will it bend
- It's a rat
- Will it break

270
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,519
Perhaps it's the head
that I found in the lake

271
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,959
Listen now
You don't understand

272
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,479
That's not the point
of Christmasland

273
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:23,200
Now pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock

274
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,840
And hang it like this
on the wall

275
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
Oh, yes, does it still
have a foot

276
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,880
- Let me see, let me look
- Is it rotted and covered with gook

277
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,521
Um, let me explain.

278
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:35,281
There's no foot inside
but there's candy

279
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,721
- Or sometimes it's filled
with small toys
- Small toys

280
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,002
- Do they bite
- Do they snap
- Or explode in the sack

281
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:42,722
Well, perhaps they just spring
out and scare girls and boys

282
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:45,242
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun

283
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:47,962
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

284
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:50,363
Everyone, please
Now not so fast

285
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:53,403
There's something here
that you don't quite grasp

286
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,723
I don't know.
Do you get it?

287
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:58,924
Well, I may as well
give them what they want.

288
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,564
And the best I must confess
I have saved for the last

289
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:05,884
For the ruler
of this Christmasland

290
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:09,285
Is a fearsome king
with a deep, mighty voice

291
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:12,605
Least, that's what
I've come to understand

292
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,966
And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold

293
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,326
Like a lobster huge and red

294
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:22,726
When he sets out to slay
with his rain gear on

295
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:26,087
Carting bulging sacks
with his big great arms

296
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:29,327
That is so I've heard it said

297
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:33,007
And on a dark cold night
under full moonlight

298
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:38,288
He flies into a fog
like a vulture in the sky

299
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:41,728
And they call him

300
00:22:41,888 --> 00:22:46,729
Sandy Claws

301
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,090
Well, at least they're excited

302
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,650
But they don't understand

303
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,131
That special kind of feeling
in Christmasland

304
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,011
Oh, well.

305
00:23:12,412 --> 00:23:14,212
Hmm.

306
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:23,293
Hmm.

307
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:38,815
There's got to be a logical way
to explain this Christmas thing.

308
00:23:49,976 --> 00:23:55,257
You've poisoned me for the
last time, you wretched girl.

309
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:06,618
Oh, my head!

310
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:12,699
The door is open!

311
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:16,459
- Hello!
- Jack Skellington!

312
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:21,340
- Up here, my boy.
- Doctor, I need to borrow some
equipment.

313
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,940
Is that so? Whatever for?

314
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,340
I'm conducting a series
of experiments.

315
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,341
How perfectly marvelous!

316
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:35,501
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.

317
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:39,502
Come on into the lab
and we'll get you all fixed up.

318
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:42,102
Hmm. Experiments?

319
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:47,463
Zero, I'm home!

320
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,670
Interesting reaction!
But what does it mean?

321
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:33,961
You can come out now
if you promise to behave.

322
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:36,322
Sally?

323
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:37,882
Sally?

324
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:41,042
Oh, gone again!

325
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,564
Hmm.

326
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:44,569
Oh!

327
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:09,892
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

328
00:29:11,852 --> 00:29:14,733
Don't know if we're ever
going to get him back

329
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:19,733
He's all alone up there
locked away inside

330
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:24,814
- Never says a word
- Hope he hasn't died

331
00:29:24,974 --> 00:29:27,694
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

332
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:38,575
Christmastime
is buzzing in my skull

333
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,536
Will it let me be
I cannot tell

334
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,576
There's so many things
I cannot grasp

335
00:29:44,736 --> 00:29:47,576
When I think I've got it
and then at last

336
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:50,577
Through my bony fingers
it does slip

337
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:53,177
Like a snowflake
in a fiery grip

338
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:56,737
Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try I keep forgetting

339
00:29:56,897 --> 00:30:00,138
Like a memory
long since past

340
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,098
Here in an instant
Gone in a flash

341
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:05,418
What does it mean
What does it mean

342
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:08,659
In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked

343
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:12,899
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

344
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:16,660
Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door

345
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,860
Though I do not have the key
Something's here I cannot see

346
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,501
What does it mean
What does it mean

347
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:27,221
What does it mean

348
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:32,261
Hmm. Hmm.

349
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:35,102
I've read these Christmas books
so many times

350
00:30:35,262 --> 00:30:38,102
I know the stories
and I know the rhymes

351
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:41,062
I know the Christmas carols
all by heart

352
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:44,263
My skull's so full
it's tearing me apart

353
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:47,183
As often as I've read them
Something's wrong

354
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:50,103
It's so hard to put
my bony finger on

355
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:53,544
Or perhaps it's really not as deep
as I've been led to think

356
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:56,744
Am I trying much too hard

357
00:30:56,904 --> 00:30:58,624
Of course
I've been too close to see

358
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:01,865
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

359
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:05,505
It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air

360
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:08,986
Invisible but everywhere

361
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:13,306
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it

362
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:16,786
You know I think this Christmas thing
is not as tricky as it seems

363
00:31:16,947 --> 00:31:20,107
And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone

364
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:23,787
Not anyone in fact, but me
Why I can make a Christmas tree

365
00:31:23,947 --> 00:31:27,108
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmastime

366
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:32,388
I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do

367
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:36,709
Eureka!

368
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:41,269
This year,
Christmas will be ours!

369
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:50,630
Patience, everyone. Jack has
a special job for each of you.

370
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:55,631
Dr. Beetlestein.

371
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,591
Your Christmas assignment
is ready.

372
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:04,912
Dr. Beetlestein,
to the front of the line.

373
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:12,193
What kind of noise is that
for a baby to make?

374
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:14,913
- Perhaps it can be improved?
- No problem!

375
00:32:15,073 --> 00:32:16,713
I knew it!

376
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:20,234
Doctor, thank you for coming.

377
00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:22,674
We need some of these.

378
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:24,834
Hmm.

379
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:28,355
Their construction should be
exceedingly simple, I think.

380
00:32:28,515 --> 00:32:31,715
How horrible
our Christmas will be.

381
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,315
No! How jolly!

382
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:38,196
Oh. How jolly
our Christmas will be.

383
00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:43,876
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.

384
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:45,917
- Specifically.
- By name.

385
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:48,557
- Lock.
- Shock.
- Barrel.

386
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:52,477
Jack, Jack,
it's Boogie's boys.

387
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,878
Ah, Halloween's finest
trick or treaters.

388
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,198
The job I have for you
is top secret.

389
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:03,078
It requires craft,
cunning, mischief.

390
00:33:03,238 --> 00:33:06,199
And we thought
you didn't like us, Jack.

391
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,319
Absolutely no one
is to know about it. Not a soul!

392
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:13,120
Now.

393
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,320
Tree.

394
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,840
Christmas Town.

395
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,361
Ow! Hmm.

396
00:33:24,521 --> 00:33:26,761
And one more thing.

397
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:30,202
Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!

398
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:31,882
Whatever you say, Jack.

399
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:35,882
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.

400
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:56,965
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws

401
00:33:57,125 --> 00:34:01,885
- I wanna do it
- Let's draw straws
- Jack said we should work together

402
00:34:02,045 --> 00:34:04,205
- Three of a kind
- Birds of a feather
- Now and forever

403
00:34:04,365 --> 00:34:07,846
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

404
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:11,086
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

405
00:34:11,246 --> 00:34:14,567
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight

406
00:34:14,727 --> 00:34:17,927
Throw away the key
and then turn off all the lights

407
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:21,327
First we're going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait

408
00:34:21,487 --> 00:34:24,688
When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate

409
00:34:24,848 --> 00:34:27,848
Wait, I've got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man

410
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:31,368
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

411
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,689
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box

412
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:38,049
Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks

413
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:43,090
And Mr. Oogie Boogie man

414
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,410
Can take the whole thing
over then

415
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,650
He'll be so pleased I do declare

416
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,451
That he will cook him rare
Whee

417
00:34:58,451 --> 00:35:01,652
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then

418
00:35:01,812 --> 00:35:05,172
Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

419
00:35:05,332 --> 00:35:08,453
You're so stupid
Think now if we blow him up
to smithereens

420
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:11,733
We may lose some pieces and then
Jack will beat us black and green

421
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:14,973
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag

422
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:17,934
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad

423
00:35:18,094 --> 00:35:21,814
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
is the meanest guy around

424
00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:26,815
- If I were on his boogie list
- I'd get out of town

425
00:35:28,495 --> 00:35:31,815
He'll be so pleased
by our success

426
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:35,176
That he'll reward us too
I'll bet

427
00:35:35,336 --> 00:35:38,456
Perhaps he'll make
his special brew

428
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:40,296
Of snake and spider stew

429
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:43,497
We're his little henchmen
and we take our job with pride

430
00:35:43,657 --> 00:35:46,897
We do our best to please him
and stay on his good side

431
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:49,537
- I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
- I'm not the dumb one

432
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:51,257
- You're no fun
- Shut up
- Make me

433
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:54,498
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good you'll see

434
00:35:54,658 --> 00:35:57,978
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read

435
00:35:58,138 --> 00:36:01,179
Now in the box we'll wait
and hide until his curiosity

436
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:04,739
Entices him to look inside and then
we'll have him one, two, three

437
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:07,939
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick

438
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,420
Lock him up for 90 years
See what makes him tick

439
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,740
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits

440
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,140
Mr. Oogie Boogie
is sure to get his kicks

441
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,501
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see

442
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:24,981
Lock him in a cage
and then throw away the key

443
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:34,342
Sandy Claws, huh?

444
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:43,103
It goes something like this.

445
00:36:48,544 --> 00:36:50,544
How about it?
Think you can manage?

446
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:52,944
A-one, and a-two,
and a-three, and a--

447
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:03,026
- Next!
- Fantastic!

448
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:06,786
Now, why don't you all practice on that,
and we'll be in great shape.

449
00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:10,226
Sally, I need your help
more than anyone's.

450
00:37:10,386 --> 00:37:13,307
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.

451
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:16,867
- That's splendid!
- No! It was about your Christmas.

452
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:20,908
- There was smoke and fire.
- That's not my Christmas.

453
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:24,468
My Christmas is filled
with laughter and joy.

454
00:37:24,628 --> 00:37:29,949
And this: my Sandy Claws outfit.
I want you to make it.

455
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:33,429
Jack, please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster.

456
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:36,629
How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.

457
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:38,750
This part's red.
The trim is white.

458
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,070
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.

459
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,790
Who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy Claws outfit?

460
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,470
- Next!
- I have...

461
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,631
- Oh.
- every confidence in you.

462
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:53,111
But it seems wrong to me.
Very wrong.

463
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,871
This device
is called a nutcracker.

464
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:58,472
Jack! Jack! We caught 'im!
We got 'im!

465
00:37:58,632 --> 00:38:01,632
Perfect! Open it up. Quickly!

466
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:06,873
That's not Sandy Claws!

467
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:09,273
- It isn't?
- Who is it?

468
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:15,154
- Bunny!
- Eek! Ooh.

469
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:17,794
Not Sandy Claws! Take him back!

470
00:38:17,954 --> 00:38:20,634
- We followed your instructions.
- We went through the door.

471
00:38:20,794 --> 00:38:23,835
Which door?
There's more than one.

472
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:27,835
Sandy Claws is behind the door
shaped like this.

473
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:30,955
I told you!

474
00:38:31,115 --> 00:38:33,196
- You knock it off!
- Get-- Ow! Ow!

475
00:38:37,116 --> 00:38:39,516
I'm very sorry
for the inconvenience, sir.

476
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:43,957
Take him home first!
And apologize again.

477
00:38:44,117 --> 00:38:46,397
Be careful with Sandy Claws
when you fetch him.

478
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,077
- Treat him nicely.
- Got it.

479
00:38:48,237 --> 00:38:51,478
We'll get it right next time.

480
00:38:51,638 --> 00:38:54,598
You will be a decided improvement...

481
00:38:54,758 --> 00:38:57,238
over that treacherous Sally.

482
00:38:57,398 --> 00:39:01,759
Master. The plans.

483
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:07,840
Excellent, lgor.

484
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:19,161
- What?
- What's goin' on?

485
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:23,521
This time

486
00:39:25,402 --> 00:39:27,002
This time

487
00:39:27,162 --> 00:39:29,042
Making Christmas

488
00:39:30,722 --> 00:39:33,122
Making Christmas

489
00:39:33,282 --> 00:39:37,923
Making Christmas
Making Christmas is so fine

490
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:42,884
It's ours this time
And won't the children be surprised

491
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:45,644
It's ours this time

492
00:39:45,804 --> 00:39:50,684
- Making Christmas
- Making Christmas
- Making Christmas

493
00:39:50,844 --> 00:39:53,445
Time to give them something fun

494
00:39:53,605 --> 00:39:56,965
They'll talk about
for years to come

495
00:39:57,125 --> 00:40:02,246
- Let's have a cheer from everyone
- It's time to party

496
00:40:02,406 --> 00:40:06,446
Making Christmas
Making Christmas

497
00:40:06,606 --> 00:40:10,447
Snakes and mice
get wrapped up so nice

498
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:13,887
With spider legs and pretty bows

499
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:16,687
It's ours this time

500
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,528
All together
that and this

501
00:40:19,688 --> 00:40:24,488
With all our tricks
we're making Christmastime

502
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:26,888
Here comes Jack.

503
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:32,289
I don't believe
what's happening to me

504
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:36,810
My hopes, my dreams

505
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:40,730
My fantasies

506
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:48,651
Won't they be impressed
I am a genius

507
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:52,051
See how I transform
this old rat

508
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:55,892
Into a most delightful hat

509
00:40:56,052 --> 00:41:00,532
- Hmm.
- My compliments from me to you
on this your most intriguing hat

510
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:04,013
- Consider though this substitute
A bat in place of this old rat
- Huh!

511
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:07,213
No, no, no, now that's all wrong
This thing will never make a present

512
00:41:07,373 --> 00:41:11,053
It's been dead for much too long
Try something fresher
Something pleasant

513
00:41:11,213 --> 00:41:12,334
Try again
Don't give up

514
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:15,054
All together
that and this

515
00:41:15,214 --> 00:41:19,454
With all our tricks
we're making Christmastime

516
00:42:25,262 --> 00:42:29,142
- This time, this time
- It's ours

517
00:42:29,302 --> 00:42:32,383
Making Christmas
Making Christmas

518
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:36,863
La, la, la
It's almost here and we can't wait

519
00:42:37,023 --> 00:42:40,264
So ring the bells
and celebrate

520
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:45,184
'Cause when the full moon
starts to climb, we'll all sing out

521
00:42:45,344 --> 00:42:48,544
It's Christmastime

522
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:04,146
Kathleen, Bobby, Susie.
Yes, Susie's been nice.

523
00:43:04,306 --> 00:43:08,187
Nice, nice, naughty,
nice, nice, nice--

524
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:10,627
There are hardly
any naughty children this year.

525
00:43:11,907 --> 00:43:14,587
Now, who could that be?

526
00:43:16,348 --> 00:43:17,788
- Trick or treat!
- Huh?

527
00:43:17,948 --> 00:43:20,308
Ya!

528
00:43:22,588 --> 00:43:25,709
You don't look like yourself,
Jack, not at all.

529
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,589
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!

530
00:43:28,749 --> 00:43:31,189
But you're the Pumpkin King!

531
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:35,990
Not anymore.
And I feel so much better now!

532
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,270
Jack, I know you think
something's missing, but--

533
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,310
- Ow!
- Sorry.

534
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,711
You're right.
Something is missing, but what?

535
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:49,111
I've got the beard, the coat,
the boots, the belt--

536
00:43:49,271 --> 00:43:53,792
- Jack, Jack, this time we bagged him.
- This time we really did!

537
00:43:53,952 --> 00:43:56,992
- He sure is big, Jack!
- And heavy!

538
00:43:57,152 --> 00:43:59,512
Let me out!

539
00:43:59,672 --> 00:44:04,033
Sandy Claws in person!
What a pleasure to meet you!

540
00:44:04,993 --> 00:44:07,033
Wh-- Why, you have hands!

541
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:09,994
- You don't have claws at all!
- Wha--

542
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,834
Where am l?

543
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:16,114
Surprised, aren't you?
I knew you would be.

544
00:44:16,274 --> 00:44:19,235
You don't need to have another
worry about Christmas this year.

545
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:23,315
- Wha-- Well, wha-- Wha--
- Consider this a vacation,
Sandy, a reward.

546
00:44:23,475 --> 00:44:27,116
- It's your turn to take it easy.
- B-But there must be some mistake!

547
00:44:27,276 --> 00:44:32,236
See that he's comfortable.
Just a second, fellas. Of course!

548
00:44:32,396 --> 00:44:34,556
- That's what I'm missing!
- B-B-but--

549
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,517
- Thanks.
- Y-You just can't--

550
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:38,997
Hold on.
Where are we going now?

551
00:44:39,157 --> 00:44:41,557
Ho, ho, ho! No.

552
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:45,158
- This is worse than I thought.
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Much worse.

553
00:44:45,318 --> 00:44:47,558
- Ho, ho, ho!
- I know.

554
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:50,718
Me, on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?

555
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:52,638
- Where are we taking him?
- Where?

556
00:44:52,798 --> 00:44:54,599
To Oogie Boogie, of course.

557
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:57,719
There isn't anywhere in the whole world
more comfortable than that.

558
00:44:57,879 --> 00:45:01,959
- And Jack said to make him
comfortable, didn't he?
- Yes, he did.

559
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:06,400
Haven't you heard of peace on earth
and goodwill toward men?

560
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,520
No!

561
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:17,481
Ah! This'll stop Jack.

562
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:33,563
What a joy to think of all
we'll have in common.

563
00:45:33,723 --> 00:45:38,884
We'll have conversations
worth having!

564
00:45:43,004 --> 00:45:45,004
Don't do this!

565
00:45:45,164 --> 00:45:47,445
Naughty children
never get any presents!

566
00:45:47,605 --> 00:45:50,605
- I think he might be too big!
- Ooh!

567
00:45:50,765 --> 00:45:54,045
No, he's not.
If he can go down a chimney...

568
00:45:54,205 --> 00:45:57,286
he can fit down here.

569
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:27,729
Well, well, well!
What have we here?

570
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:32,210
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oooh, I'm really scared!

571
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,930
So you're the one
everybody's talkin' about.

572
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,410
You're jokin'
You're jokin'

573
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,491
I can't believe my eyes

574
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:44,771
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy

575
00:46:44,931 --> 00:46:48,772
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse

576
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:53,492
I might just split a seam now
if I don't die laughin' first

577
00:46:53,652 --> 00:46:57,332
Mr. Oogie Boogie says
there's trouble close at hand

578
00:46:57,492 --> 00:47:01,653
You better pay attention now
'cause I'm the boogie man

579
00:47:01,813 --> 00:47:05,853
And if you aren't shakin'
there's somethin' very wrong

580
00:47:06,013 --> 00:47:09,814
'Cause this may be the last time
you hear the boogie song

581
00:47:09,974 --> 00:47:11,574
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh

582
00:47:11,734 --> 00:47:13,614
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh

583
00:47:13,774 --> 00:47:15,975
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh

584
00:47:16,135 --> 00:47:18,695
- I'm the Oogie Boogie man
- He's the Oogie Boogie man

585
00:47:18,815 --> 00:47:22,815
Release me now or you must face
the dire consequences

586
00:47:22,975 --> 00:47:26,736
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses

587
00:47:26,896 --> 00:47:29,056
Ah, you're jokin'
You're jokin'

588
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:31,256
I can't believe my ears

589
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:35,257
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears

590
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:37,657
It's funny
I'm laughin'

591
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:39,577
You really are too much

592
00:47:39,737 --> 00:47:44,138
And now with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff

593
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:46,938
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna do the best I can.

594
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:49,098
Whoa

595
00:47:49,258 --> 00:47:53,339
The sound of rolling dice to me
is music in the air

596
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:57,739
'Cause I'm a gamblin' boogie man
although I don't play fair

597
00:47:57,899 --> 00:48:01,660
It's much more fun
I must confess with lives on the line

598
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,860
Not mine, of course
But yours, old boy

599
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,980
Now that'd be just fine

600
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:10,301
Release me fast or you will have to
answer for this heinous act

601
00:48:10,461 --> 00:48:14,381
Oh, brother, you're somethin'
You put me in a spin

602
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:18,542
You aren't comprehending
the position that you're in

603
00:48:18,702 --> 00:48:22,662
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer

604
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:24,862
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie

605
00:48:25,022 --> 00:48:29,103
And you ain't goin' nowhere

606
00:48:55,906 --> 00:48:58,306
Whoa! It's Jack!

607
00:49:04,587 --> 00:49:08,547
Think of us as you soar
triumphantly through the sky...

608
00:49:08,707 --> 00:49:11,268
outshining every star...

609
00:49:11,428 --> 00:49:15,188
your silhouette
a dark blot on the moon.

610
00:49:15,348 --> 00:49:17,548
You, who are our pride.

611
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,189
You, who are our glory.

612
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:24,429
- You, who have frightened
millions into an early grave.
- Ow!

613
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:27,149
You, who have, uh...

614
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:30,750
devastated the,
the souls of the living?

615
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:34,630
Oh, no! We can't take off in this.

616
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:38,071
- The reindeer can't see an inch
in front of their noses.
- Whew!

617
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:41,191
This fog's as thick as, as--

618
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:44,391
- Jellied brains.
- Or thicker!

619
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:47,272
There go all of my hopes...

620
00:49:47,432 --> 00:49:51,312
my precious plans,
my glorious dreams.

621
00:49:51,472 --> 00:49:55,032
There goes Christmas.

622
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:59,393
No, Zero. Down, boy.

623
00:49:59,553 --> 00:50:02,953
My, what a brilliant nose you have!

624
00:50:03,113 --> 00:50:05,274
The better to light my way!

625
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:07,994
To the head
of the team, Zero!

626
00:50:09,514 --> 00:50:11,674
We're off!

627
00:50:14,635 --> 00:50:16,395
Wait, Jack! No!

628
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:28,396
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ho!

629
00:50:37,237 --> 00:50:39,237
Good-bye, Jack.

630
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:42,278
My dearest Jack.

631
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:45,558
Oh, how I hope
my premonition is wrong.

632
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:55,639
I sense there's something
in the wind

633
00:50:55,799 --> 00:51:00,720
That feels like
tragedy's at hand

634
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,920
And though I'd like
to stand by him

635
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:11,081
Can't shake this feeling
that I have

636
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:16,242
The worst
is just around the bend

637
00:51:16,402 --> 00:51:20,202
And does he notice

638
00:51:20,362 --> 00:51:24,403
My feelings for him

639
00:51:24,563 --> 00:51:27,443
And will he see

640
00:51:27,603 --> 00:51:31,603
How much he means to me

641
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:36,644
I think it's not to be

642
00:51:36,804 --> 00:51:41,965
What will become
of my dear friend

643
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:47,085
Where will his actions
lead us then

644
00:51:47,245 --> 00:51:52,246
Although I'd like
to join the crowd

645
00:51:52,406 --> 00:51:57,286
In their enthusiastic cloud

646
00:51:57,446 --> 00:52:02,567
Try as I may it doesn't last

647
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,647
And will we ever

648
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:10,728
End up together

649
00:52:10,888 --> 00:52:13,848
No, I think not

650
00:52:14,008 --> 00:52:18,009
It's never to become

651
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:23,329
For I am not the one

652
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:45,212
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

653
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:47,372
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

654
00:52:54,893 --> 00:52:56,933
Santa!

655
00:53:15,655 --> 00:53:18,215
Santa?

656
00:53:18,335 --> 00:53:22,656
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?

657
00:53:22,816 --> 00:53:25,016
- Uh, uh, uh, uh--
- That's all right.

658
00:53:25,176 --> 00:53:29,737
I have a special present for you
anyway. There you go, sonny.

659
00:53:29,897 --> 00:53:33,217
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

660
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:40,978
And what did Santa
bring you, honey?

661
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:46,219
Merry Christmas!

662
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:51,019
Hello. Police.

663
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:55,500
Attacked by Christmas toys?
That's strange. That's the
second toy complaint we've had.

664
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,300
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

665
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,621
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

666
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:31,024
Huh?

667
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,944
Oh, wait!

668
00:54:38,344 --> 00:54:40,105
Whoa! Help! Help!

669
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:18,989
You're welcome, one and all!

670
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,229
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.

671
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:24,270
Police. I know. I know.
A skeleton. Keep calm.

672
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:27,350
Turn off all the lights. Make sure
the doors are locked. Hello. Police.

673
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,950
Reports are pouring in
from all over the globe...

674
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:33,191
that an impostor is shamelessly
impersonating Santa Claus...

675
00:55:33,351 --> 00:55:35,831
mocking and mangling
this joyous holiday.

676
00:55:37,311 --> 00:55:39,311
Authorities assure us
that at this moment...

677
00:55:39,471 --> 00:55:43,752
military units are mobilizing to stop
the perpetrator of this heinous crime.

678
00:55:43,912 --> 00:55:46,512
- Jack! Someone has to help Jack.
- Wherever you are...

679
00:55:46,672 --> 00:55:50,393
- Where'd they take that Sandy Claws?
- come back and save Christmas.

680
00:55:59,914 --> 00:56:03,314
Look, Zero, searchlights!

681
00:56:10,675 --> 00:56:12,755
They're celebrating!

682
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:16,756
They're thanking us
for doing such a good job.

683
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:21,516
Whoa! Careful down there.
You almost hit us!

684
00:56:21,676 --> 00:56:25,236
It's okay, Zero. Head higher.

685
00:56:29,157 --> 00:56:31,957
Are you a gamblin' man, Sandy?

686
00:56:32,117 --> 00:56:35,518
Let's play. Hmm?

687
00:56:37,078 --> 00:56:41,398
My, my! What have we here?

688
00:56:50,759 --> 00:56:52,840
I'll get you out of here.

689
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,640
Ah. Lovely.

690
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,800
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Uh, tickle, tickle, tickle.

691
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,921
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

692
00:57:03,961 --> 00:57:09,241
What? You try to make
a dupe out of me!

693
00:57:16,442 --> 00:57:17,842
Oh!

694
00:57:19,723 --> 00:57:21,563
Who's next on my list?

695
00:57:21,723 --> 00:57:25,883
Ah, little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?

696
00:57:37,405 --> 00:57:41,085
They're trying to hit us. Zero!

697
00:57:51,086 --> 00:57:53,326
Merry Christmas to all...

698
00:57:53,486 --> 00:57:58,927
and to all a good night!

699
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:20,609
I knew this Christmas thing
was a bad idea.

700
00:58:20,769 --> 00:58:23,970
I felt it in my gut.

701
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,730
Terrible news, folks.

702
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:31,171
The worst tragedy of our times.

703
00:58:31,331 --> 00:58:36,371
Jack has been blown to smithereens!

704
00:58:36,531 --> 00:58:40,172
Terrible, terrible news!

705
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:45,492
Attention. Attention, citizens.

706
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:50,093
Terrible news. There's still
no sign of Santa Claus.

707
00:58:50,253 --> 00:58:53,373
Although the impostor
has been shot down...

708
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:58,574
it looks like Christmas will
have to be cancelled this year.

709
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:02,614
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down...

710
00:59:02,774 --> 00:59:06,695
but there's still
no sign yet of Santa.

711
00:59:18,216 --> 00:59:21,096
What have I done

712
00:59:21,256 --> 00:59:24,537
What have I done

713
00:59:24,697 --> 00:59:27,737
How could I

714
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:31,017
Be so blind

715
00:59:31,177 --> 00:59:34,178
All is lost

716
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:37,538
Where was I

717
00:59:37,698 --> 00:59:40,698
Spoiled all

718
00:59:40,859 --> 00:59:44,099
Spoiled all

719
00:59:44,259 --> 00:59:47,219
Everything's

720
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:50,540
Gone all wrong

721
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,740
What have I done

722
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,060
What have I done

723
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:01,421
Find a deep cave to hide in

724
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:04,341
In a million years

725
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:09,062
They'll find me only dust

726
01:00:09,222 --> 01:00:13,342
And a plaque that reads

727
01:00:13,502 --> 01:00:18,423
Here lies poor old Jack

728
01:00:19,823 --> 01:00:24,543
But I never intended
all this madness

729
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,064
Never

730
01:00:26,224 --> 01:00:30,064
And nobody really understood

731
01:00:30,224 --> 01:00:32,064
Well, how could they

732
01:00:32,224 --> 01:00:36,385
That all I ever wanted was
to bring them something great

733
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:40,425
Why does nothing ever
turn out like it should

734
01:00:40,585 --> 01:00:43,146
Well, what the heck

735
01:00:43,266 --> 01:00:45,306
I went and did my best

736
01:00:45,466 --> 01:00:50,226
And by god
I really tasted something swell

737
01:00:50,386 --> 01:00:54,547
And for a moment
why, I even touched the sky

738
01:00:54,707 --> 01:00:58,827
And at least I left some stories
they can tell, I did

739
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:02,988
And for the first time
since I don't remember when

740
01:01:03,148 --> 01:01:07,068
I felt just like
my old bony self again

741
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:09,228
And l, Jack

742
01:01:09,388 --> 01:01:11,829
The Pumpkin King

743
01:01:11,989 --> 01:01:16,469
That's right, I am the Pumpkin King
Ha-ha-ha-ha

744
01:01:16,629 --> 01:01:20,110
And I just can't wait
until next Halloween

745
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:24,230
'Cause I've got some new ideas
that will really make them scream

746
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:29,271
And by god I'm really
going to give it all my might

747
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:33,071
Uh-oh. I hope there's still time...

748
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,472
to set things right.

749
01:01:36,632 --> 01:01:39,592
Sandy Claws! Hmm.

750
01:01:39,752 --> 01:01:41,872
You wait 'til Jack
hears about this!

751
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,952
By the time he's through with
you, you'll be lucky if you--

752
01:01:45,113 --> 01:01:47,193
The King of Halloween...

753
01:01:47,353 --> 01:01:51,073
has been blown to smithereens.

754
01:01:51,233 --> 01:01:56,154
Skeleton Jack
is now a pile of dust.

755
01:01:56,314 --> 01:01:59,074
Come on, Zero.
Christmas isn't over yet.

756
01:02:06,755 --> 01:02:10,915
What's that you said
about luck, rag doll?

757
01:02:16,356 --> 01:02:19,676
Help! Help! Help!

758
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:21,637
Shh.

759
01:02:23,877 --> 01:02:26,637
Looks like it's Oogie's turn
to boogie now.

760
01:02:26,797 --> 01:02:29,437
- Help!
- One, two, three...

761
01:02:29,598 --> 01:02:32,518
four, five, six, seven.

762
01:02:32,678 --> 01:02:34,798
Help!

763
01:02:36,158 --> 01:02:39,759
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.

764
01:02:39,919 --> 01:02:44,319
Oh, I'm feeling weak with hunger!

765
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:47,440
One more roll of the dice
oughta do it.

766
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,120
What? Snake eyes?

767
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,121
Eleven!

768
01:02:57,281 --> 01:03:00,841
Looks like I won the jackpot!

769
01:03:01,001 --> 01:03:05,922
Bye-bye, doll face and sandman.

770
01:03:08,762 --> 01:03:10,282
What the--

771
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:15,123
- Hello, Oogie.
- J-J-J-Jack!

772
01:03:15,283 --> 01:03:20,323
But they said you were dead.
You must be double dead!

773
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:22,003
Oh!

774
01:03:28,124 --> 01:03:31,364
Well, come on, bone man!

775
01:03:38,925 --> 01:03:41,486
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ha!

776
01:03:46,006 --> 01:03:48,326
Fire!

777
01:03:50,687 --> 01:03:53,127
Hmm. Ooh-ooh-ooh!

778
01:03:59,528 --> 01:04:01,528
Jack, look out!

779
01:04:06,128 --> 01:04:08,169
So long, Jack.

780
01:04:10,289 --> 01:04:14,769
How dare you treat my friends
so shamefully!

781
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:23,370
Now look what you've done!

782
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:27,011
My bugs! My bugs!

783
01:04:27,171 --> 01:04:31,211
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!

784
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:34,772
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!

785
01:04:34,932 --> 01:04:37,812
My bugs! My bugs!

786
01:04:39,372 --> 01:04:41,172
Forgive me, Mr. Claws.

787
01:04:41,332 --> 01:04:43,373
I'm afraid I've made
a terrible mess of your holiday.

788
01:04:43,533 --> 01:04:46,533
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?

789
01:04:46,693 --> 01:04:51,574
The next time you get the urge
to take over someone else's
holiday, I'd listen to her.

790
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:55,214
She's the only one who makes any
sense around this insane asylum.

791
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:58,814
- Skeletons! Boogie men! Ooh.
- I hope there's still time.

792
01:04:58,974 --> 01:05:02,135
To fix Christmas?
Of course there is!

793
01:05:02,295 --> 01:05:05,015
I'm Santa Claus.

794
01:05:09,376 --> 01:05:12,736
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.

795
01:05:12,896 --> 01:05:14,896
How did you
get down here, Sally?

796
01:05:15,056 --> 01:05:19,257
Oh, l-l was trying to--
Well, I wanted to, to--

797
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:21,857
- To help me.
- I couldn't let you just--

798
01:05:22,017 --> 01:05:25,777
Sally, I can't believe
I never realized that you--

799
01:05:25,937 --> 01:05:28,978
- Jack! Jack!
- Here he is!
- Alive!

800
01:05:29,138 --> 01:05:32,338
- Just like we said!
- Grab ahold, my boy!

801
01:05:33,658 --> 01:05:35,378
Whoa!

802
01:05:35,538 --> 01:05:40,219
Good news, folks. Santa Claus, the one
and only, has finally been spotted.

803
01:05:40,379 --> 01:05:43,499
Old Saint Nick appears to be
traveling at supersonic speed.

804
01:05:43,659 --> 01:05:47,660
He's setting things right, bringing
joy and cheer wherever he goes.

805
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,420
Yes, folks, Kris Kringle
has pulled it out of the bag...

806
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:55,101
and delivered Christmas
to excited children all over the world.

807
01:05:57,181 --> 01:05:59,261
La, la, la, la
La-la-la-la

808
01:05:59,421 --> 01:06:01,341
La, la, la, la
La-la-la-la

809
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:03,222
- Jack!
- Jack's back!

810
01:06:03,382 --> 01:06:06,462
- Jack?
- Jack's okay!
- He's all right!
- It's Jack!

811
01:06:06,622 --> 01:06:09,302
Jack's okay
And he's back

812
01:06:09,462 --> 01:06:11,743
Oh, yea
He's all right

813
01:06:11,903 --> 01:06:16,063
Let's shout, make a fuss
Scream it out, whee

814
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:18,703
Jack is back now
Everyone sing

815
01:06:18,863 --> 01:06:22,264
In the town of Halloween

816
01:06:22,424 --> 01:06:25,784
- It's great to be home!
- Ho-ho-ho-ho!

817
01:06:27,464 --> 01:06:30,025
Happy Halloween!

818
01:06:30,185 --> 01:06:33,985
Merry Christmas!

819
01:06:34,145 --> 01:06:36,705
- What's this
- What's this
- I haven't got a clue

820
01:06:36,865 --> 01:06:38,906
- What's this
- Why, it's completely new

821
01:06:39,066 --> 01:06:40,946
What's this
Must be a Christmas thing

822
01:06:41,106 --> 01:06:43,706
- What's this
- It's really very strange

823
01:06:50,867 --> 01:06:54,067
This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween

824
01:06:54,227 --> 01:06:55,868
What's this
What's this

825
01:07:01,068 --> 01:07:04,028
Careful, my precious jewel.

826
01:07:28,871 --> 01:07:34,312
My dearest friend
if you don't mind

827
01:07:34,472 --> 01:07:40,433
I'd like to join you by your side

828
01:07:40,593 --> 01:07:46,553
Where we can gaze
into the stars

829
01:07:46,713 --> 01:07:50,754
And sit together

830
01:07:50,914 --> 01:07:54,834
Now and forever

831
01:07:54,994 --> 01:07:58,115
For it is plain

832
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:02,115
As anyone can see

833
01:08:02,275 --> 01:08:07,996
We're simply meant to be
