1
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,441
<i>Let me tell you what</i>
<i>"Like A Virgin"is about.</i>

2
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:11,845
<i>It's all about a girl who digs</i>
<i>a guy with a big dick.</i>

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,481
<i>The entire song</i>
<i>is a metaphor for big dicks.</i>

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,548
No, it ain't.

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,852
It's about a girl
who's very vulnerable.

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,088
She's been fucked over a few
time and she meets a guy...

7
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:22,922
who's sensitive.

8
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:26,026
Timeout. Tell that bullshit
to the tourists.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,827
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

10
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,996
Like A Virgin is not about
some sensitive girl...

11
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,465
who meets a nice fella.

12
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,235
That's "True Blue" is about.
No argument about that.

13
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:39,439
- Which one is "True Blue"?
- It was a big hit for Madonna.

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,074
I don't even follow
that top-of-the-pops shit...

15
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,473
and I've heard of "True Blue".

16
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,211
I didn't say I ain't heard it.
All I asked is, how's it go?

17
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,314
Excuse me for not being the
world's biggest Madonna fan.

18
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,550
Personally, I can do
without her.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,485
I used to like her
early stuff, "Borderline"...

20
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,522
but when she got "Papa,
Don't Preach", I tuned out.

21
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,658
Hey, you guys are making me
lose my train of thought here.

22
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,693
I was sayin' something.
What was it?

23
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:03,963
Oh, Toby's that
little Chinese girl.

24
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,267
- What was her last name?
- What's that?

25
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,436
It's an old address book
I found in a coat...

26
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,604
I haven't worn
in a coon's age.

27
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:14,607
- What was that name?
- What the fuck I talkin' about?

28
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,472
You said "True Blue"
was about a guy...

29
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,379
a sensitive girl
who meets a nice guy...

30
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,848
"but "Like A Virgin"
was a metaphor for big dicks.

31
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,543
Let me tell you what
Like A Virgin is about.

32
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,187
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

33
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,622
I'm talkin' morning, day,
night, afternoon...

34
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,258
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick!

35
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,761
- How many dicks is that?
- A lot.

36
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,430
Then one day, she meets this
John Holmes mother-fucker.

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,599
It's like, "Whoa, baby".

38
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,868
He's like Charles Bronson
in "The Great Escape".

39
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:45,638
He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's
gettin' serious dick action.

40
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,274
She's feelin' somethin'
she ain't felt since forever...

41
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,976
pain, pain.

42
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,678
Chew? Toby Chew?

43
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,948
It hurts. It hurts her.
It shouldn't hurt her.

44
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,583
Her pussy should be
Bubble-Yum by now.

45
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,385
But when this cat
fucks her, it hurts.

46
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,555
It hurts just like it did
the first time.

47
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,191
You see, the pain
is reminding a fuck machine...

48
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,694
what it was once
like to be a virgin.

49
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,424
Hence, "Like A Virgin".

50
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,266
Wong.

51
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,202
- Give me that fuckin' thing.
- What hell do you think...

52
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,303
you're doin'?

53
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,572
I'm sick of hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you...

54
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,607
when we leave.

55
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,009
What you mean, when we leave?
Give me it back now!

56
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,478
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning...

57
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,046
on about names.

58
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,983
Toby. Toby?

59
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,418
Toby? Toby Wong.

60
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,587
Toby Wong? Toby Wong.

61
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,690
Toby Chung
"fuckin' Charlie Chan".

62
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,293
I've got Madonna's big dick
comin' out of my left ear...

63
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,695
and Toby the Jap
I don't know what...

64
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,397
comin' out of my right.

65
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,126
Give me that book.

66
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,635
Are you gonna put it away?

67
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,933
I'm gonna do whatever fuck
I want with it.

68
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,841
Well, then I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to keep it.

69
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,376
Hey, Joe...

70
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,679
- want me to shoot this guy?
- Shit.

71
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,012
You shoot me in a dream you
better wake up and apologize.

72
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,355
You guys been listenin' to
K-BILLY's Super Sounds...

73
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,891
- of the '70s weekend?
- Yeah. That's fuckin' great.

74
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,894
- Believe the songs they play?
- Know I heard the other day?

75
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,131
Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat
by little Tony DeFranco.

76
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,465
I haven't heard that song
since I was...

77
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,633
in the fifth fuckin' grade.

78
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,135
When I was comin' down here...

79
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,938
"The Night the Lights
Went Out in Georgia" came on.

80
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,207
I ain't heard that song
since it was big.

81
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,474
But when it was big,
I must've heard it...

82
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,577
a million-trillion
fuckin' times.

83
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,345
But this is the first time
I ever realized...

84
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,680
that the girl
singin' the song...

85
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,415
is the one who shot Andy.

86
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,150
You didn't know
that Vickie Lawrence was...

87
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,151
the one who shot Andy?

88
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,153
I thought
the cheatin' wife shot Andy.

89
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,021
They say that
at the end of the song.

90
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,990
I know, mother-fucker.
I just heard it.

91
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,083
That's what I'm talkin' about.

92
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,430
I must've zoned out
during that part before.

93
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,866
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

94
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,299
You guys can get the tip.

95
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,738
Should be about
a buck apiece.

96
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,041
And you, when I come back
I want my book.

97
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,477
Sorry.
It's my book now.

98
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,312
Hey,
I changed my mind.

99
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,337
Shoot this piece of shit,
will ya?

100
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,920
Everybody cough up some green
for the little lady.

101
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,297
Come on, throw in a buck.

102
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,698
I don't tip.

103
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,968
- You don't tip?
- I don't believe in it.

104
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,337
You don't believe in tipping?

105
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,274
Do you know what these
chicks make? They make shit.

106
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,674
If she don't make enough
money she can quit.

107
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,112
I don't even know
a fuckin' Jew...

108
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,413
who'd have the balls
to say that.

109
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,483
Let me get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

110
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,985
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

111
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,188
If they really put
forth the effort...

112
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,523
I'll give 'em
somethin' extra.

113
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,258
But this tipping
automatically...

114
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,384
it's for the birds.

115
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,696
As far as I'm concerned,
they'rejust doin' theirjob.

116
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,865
- This girl was nice.
- She was okay.

117
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,301
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

118
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,201
Take you in the back
and suck your dick?

119
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,975
I'd go over 12% for that.

120
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,345
I ordered coffee, all right?
She's only filled...

121
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,579
my cup three times.

122
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,249
I want it filled six times.

123
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,951
Six times? Well, what if
she's too fuckin' busy?

124
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,088
"Too fuckin' busy" can't be
in a waitress's vocabulary.

125
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,656
Excuse me, Mr. Pink,
but the last...

126
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,826
fuckin' thing you need
is another cup of coffee.

127
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,062
These ladies aren't
starvin' to death.

128
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,897
They make minimum wage.

129
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,932
I used to work minimum wage,
and when I did...

130
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,434
I wasn't lucky
enough to have ajob...

131
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,935
that society
deemed tip-worthy.

132
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,267
You don't care they count
your tips to live?

133
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,575
You know what this is?

134
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,110
The world's
smallest violin, playin'...

135
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,079
just for the waitresses.

136
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,781
You don't have any idea
what you're talkin' about.

137
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:52,618
These people bust their ass.
This is a hard job.

138
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,654
So's working at McDonald's,
but you don't feel the need...

139
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:55,755
to tip them.

140
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,391
They're servin' you food,
but society says...

141
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,559
"Don't tip
these guys over here...

142
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,894
but tip these guys".
That's bullshit.

143
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,830
Waitressing is
the number-one occupation...

144
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,133
for female non-college
graduates in this country.

145
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,635
It's the onejob basically
any woman can get...

146
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,304
and make a living on.

147
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,169
The reason is
because of their tips.

148
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,834
Fuck all that.

149
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,381
I'm very sorry the government
taxes their tips.

150
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,783
That's fucked up.
That ain't my fault.

151
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,418
It would appear that
waitresses are one of the...

152
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,321
many groups the government
fucks on a regular basis.

153
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,356
Show me a paper
that says the government...

154
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,891
shouldn't do that,
I'll sign it.

155
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,794
I'll vote for it. But what
I won't do is play ball.

156
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,430
This non-college bullshit,
I got two words for that...

157
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,498
Learn to fuckin' type.

158
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,166
If you're expectin' me
to help out with the rent...

159
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,235
you're in for a big surprise.

160
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,903
He's convinced me.
Give me my dollar back.

161
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,236
Hey. Leave the dollars there.

162
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,835
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

163
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,847
Wait a minute.
Who didn't throw in?

164
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,750
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?

165
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,286
- Why not?
- He don't tip.

166
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,455
He don't tip?

167
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,290
- You don't tip?
- He don't believe in it.

168
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,492
Shut up.
What do you mean...

169
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,027
you don't believe in it?

170
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,496
Cough up a buck,
you cheap bastard.

171
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,498
I paid for
your goddamn breakfast.

172
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,434
Since you bought breakfast,
I'll put in.

173
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,402
But normally I would never
do this.

174
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,873
Never mind what you
normally would do.

175
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,943
Just cough in your goddamn
buck like everybody else.

176
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,342
Thank you.

177
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,781

184
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,302
I'm gonna die.

185
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,804
I'm gonna die!

186
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,533
Just hold on, buddy boy!

187
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,499
I'm gonna die!

188
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:42,481
- I'm sorry!
- Give me your hand.

189
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,083
I can't believe
she killed me, man!

190
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,385
Who'd have fuckin'
thought that?

191
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:50,923
Hey, just cancel that shit
right now!

192
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,659
You're hurt. You're hurt
real fuckin' bad...

193
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,149
but you ain't
dying!

194
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,370
All this blood's scarin'
the shit out of me, Larry!

195
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,672
I'm gonna die!
I know it!

196
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,698
Excuse me, I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.

197
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,180
Are you a doctor?

198
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,148
Are you a doctor?

199
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,548
Answer me, please!
Are you a doctor?

200
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,351
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

201
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,559
So you admit you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

202
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,862
If you're through givin' me
your amateur opinion...

203
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,197
lie back and listen.

204
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,466
I'm takin' you back
to the rendezvous...

205
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,468
Joe's gonna get you a doctor...

206
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,571
the doctor's gonna
fix you up and...

207
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,629
you're gonna be okay.

208
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:44,477
Now say it!
You're gonna be okay!

209
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,911
Say it!

210
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,648
You're gonna be okay!

211
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,817
Say the goddamn words!
You're gonna be okay!

212
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,319
Oh, God!

213
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,022
Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

214
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,289
Say it!

215
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,225
Okay, Larry.

216
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,285
Correct! Correct!

217
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,889
I'm okay.

218
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,343
Look where we are.

219
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,810
Look where we are.

220
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:24,016
She had a baby, man.
She had a baby!

221
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,244
We're in a warehouse.

222
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:30,080
Who's a tough guy?
Who's a tough guy?

223
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,260
Come on, who's a tough guy?

224
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,163
Who's a tough guy?
You're a tough guy.

225
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,790
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

226
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,339
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

227
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,875
We made it. We made it.

228
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,641
We fuckin' made it.
We have fuckin' made it.

229
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,249
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

230
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,986
Look where we are.

231
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,216
Hold on. Hold on.

232
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,295
- Shit!
- Stop bangin' your head.

233
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,195
You're gonna bang a fuckin'
hole in the floor.

234
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,292
You don't wanna hurt
the fuckin' floor, do you?

235
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,904
I can't do anything for you.

236
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,201
But when Joe gets here...

237
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,442
which should be
any time now...

238
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:27,146
he's gonna help you out,
he's gonna take care of you.

239
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,977
We're gonna sit
and wait for Joe.

240
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,641
- Who are we waitin' for?
- Joe.

241
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:43,154
Larry,
I'm fucking scared, man.

242
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,258
Would you please hold me?

243
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,993
Yeah, sure.

244
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,292
You go ahead and be scared.

245
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,061
You've been brave enough
for one day.

246
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,508
I just want you
to relax now, okay?

247
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,777
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

248
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,213
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100% again.

249
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,341
Am I hurt?
I'm hurt bad, Larry.

250
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,718
It's not good, no.

251
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,990
Hey, Larry...

252
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,858
God bless your heart
for what you're tryin' to do.

253
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,896
I was panicking
for a minute back there.

254
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,328
But I got my senses back now.

255
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,840
The situation is,
I'm shot in the belly.

256
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,400
Without medical attention,
I'm gonna die.

257
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,948
I can't take you
to a hospital.

258
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,483
Fuck jail, man!

259
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,452
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up...

260
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,441
to the front, man.

261
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,182
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

262
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,629
I won't tell 'em
anything, man.

263
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,198
I won't tell 'em anything.

264
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,689
I swear to fucking God, man.

265
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,838
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

266
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,005
I won't tell them anything.

267
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,206
You'll be safe, man.

268
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,286
You're not gonna fuckin'
die, kid. All right?

269
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,891
Listen to me.
You're gonna be fine.

270
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
Along with the kneecap,
the gut...

271
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,729
is the most painful area
a guy can get shot in.

272
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,897
No shit!

273
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,633
But it takes a long time
to die from it.

274
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,123
I'm talkin' days.

275
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,404
You're gonna
wish you were dead, but...

276
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,439
it takes days
to die from your wound.

277
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,141
Time is on your side.

278
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,371
Was that a fucking set up,
for what?

279
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,079
Shit. Orange got tagged?

280
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,050
Gut shot.

281
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,819
Fuck. Where's Brown?

282
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,547
Dead.

283
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,256
How did he die?

284
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,727
How the fuck do you think?
The cops shot him.

285
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,265
This is bad.
This is so fucking bad.

286
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,167
Is it bad?

287
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,691
As opposed to good?

288
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,438
Man, this is fucked up.

289
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,928
This is so fucked up.

290
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,669
Somebody fucked us up
big time, man.

291
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,015
You really think
we were set up?

292
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,617
Do you even doubt it, man?

293
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,585
I don't think we got set up,
I know it.

294
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,188
Where did all those cops
come from, huh?

295
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,189
One minute
they're not there...

296
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,524
and the next minute
they're there.

297
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,127
I didn't hear any sirens.
The alarm went off, okay?

298
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,563
When an alarm goes, you got
a four-minute response time.

299
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,864
Unless a patrol car
is cruising...

300
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,232
that street at that moment...

301
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,902
you got four minutes before
they can realistically respond.

302
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,104
In one minute, here were
17 blue boys out there...

303
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,640
all knowing exactly what
the fuck they were doing...

304
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,301
and they were all there!

305
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,079
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

306
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,513
Those were the ones
responding to the alarm...

307
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,781
but those first ones...

308
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,617
they were there
and they were waitin' for us.

309
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,209
Haven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

310
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,956
I haven't had a chance to think.

311
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,220
First I wasjust tryin'
to get the fuck outta there.

312
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,096
And after we got away I've
just been dealin' with him.

313
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,297
Better start thinkin'
about it...

314
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,732
'cause that's all
I'm thinkin' about.

315
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,933
I wasn't even
gonna come here...

316
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,968
I wasjust gonna
drive off, man...

317
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,471
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

318
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,839
There could've
been cops here waitin'!

319
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,103
There could be cops
comin' right now!

320
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,570
Let's go in the other room.
Hey. In there.

321
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,920
Larry, don't leave me.

322
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,990
I'll be right
in the other room, okay?

323
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,992
I'll be right there
lookin' at ya.

324
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,426
I'm right here
lookin' at you, okay?

325
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,994
I'm right over there.

326
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,404
Larry...

327
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,706
I'm gonna fucking die.

328
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,105
Larry.

329
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,112
What the fuck
am I doin' here, man?

330
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,281
I felt funny about thisjob
right off.

331
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,282
As soon as I felt it
I should have said...

332
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,052
No, thank you,
but I never listen.

333
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,653
Every time I ever got
fucked buying weed...

334
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,654
the same thing.

335
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,190
I didn't trust the guy,
but I wanted to believe him.

336
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,093
If he's not lying,
then it's great.

337
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,663
I always said that if I felt
that about ajob, I'd walk.

338
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,000
And I didn't. I didn't
because of the fuckin' money!

339
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,298
What's done is done.
I need you cool.

340
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,127
Are you cool?

341
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,101
I'm cool.

342
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,876
Splash some water
on your face.

343
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,744
Take a breather.

344
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,162
Relax. Have a cigarette.

345
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,737
I quit.

346
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,035
- All right.
- Why, you got one?

347
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,874
Okay, let's go through
what happened.

348
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,546
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

349
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,377
Then the alarm gets tripped.

350
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,550
I turn around and
all these cops are outside.

351
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,556
You're right.
It was like, bam...

352
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,658
I blinked my eyes
and they're there.

353
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,060
Everybody starts
going ape-shit.

354
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,096
Then Mr. Blonde starts
to shoot all...

355
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,199
- That's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

356
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,936
Ok. The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

357
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,773
Not until Mr. Blonde
started shootin' everybody.

358
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,642
Soon as I heard the alarm,
I saw cops.

359
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,876
It wasn't that soon.

360
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,012
They didn't let
their presence be known...

361
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,847
until after Mr. Blonde
became a madman.

362
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,349
I'm not sayin'
they weren't there.

363
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,285
But they didn't make
a move until after...

364
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,787
Mr. Blonde started
shootin' everybody.

365
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,957
I mean, that's how
I know we were set up.

366
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,525
C'mon Mr. White,
you can see that...

367
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,160
Enough of this
Mr. White shit.

368
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,462
Wait! Don't tell me
you're fuckin' name!

369
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,964
I don't wanna know it!

370
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,228
Jesus Christ,
I ain't gonna tell you mine.

371
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,939
You're right.
This is bad.

372
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:18,217
- How did you get out?
- I shot my way out.

373
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,685
Everybody started shootin',
so I blasted my way out.

374
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,059
Move it!
Get outta the way!

375
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,549
Get the fuck outta the way!

376
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,286
Get the fuck outta the way!

377
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,130
Move it!
Get outta the way!

378
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,241
Jesus Christ!

379
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,676
What the fuck
is your problem, man?

380
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,406
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck you!

381
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,910
Move!

382
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,190
- Jesus!
- Get outta the car!

383
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,817
Get the fuck outta the car!

384
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,349
Move it!
Move outta the way!

385
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,859
I tagged a couple of cops.

386
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:34,951
Did you kill anybody?

387
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:39,298
- A few cops.
- No real people?

388
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,697
Just cops.

389
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,609
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

390
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,616
That was the most insane
fuckin' thing...

391
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,484
I have ever seen.

392
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,987
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

393
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,352
I don't want to kill anybody.

394
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,191
If I gotta get out that door
and you're standin' in my way...

395
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,627
one way or the other you're
gettin' outta my way.

396
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,855
That's the way I look at it.

397
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,832
The choice between
doin' ten years...

398
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,629
and takin' out
some stupid mother-fucker...

399
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,771
ain't no choice at all.

400
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,773
But I ain't no madman,
either.

401
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,843
What the fuck
was Joe thinkin'?

402
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,367
You can't work
with a guy like that.

403
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,549
We're awful goddamn lucky
he didn't tag us...

404
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,184
when he shot the place up.

405
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,415
I came this close
to takin' his ass out myself.

406
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:40,359
I mean, everybody panics.
Everybody.

407
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,160
Things get tense.
It's human nature.

408
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,720
I don't care what your name
is, you can't help it.

409
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,433
Fuck, man,
you panic on the inside...

410
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,435
in your head, you know?

411
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,304
You give yourself
a couple of seconds...

412
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,473
get a hold of it
and deal with it.

413
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,074
What you don't do
is start shootin' up...

414
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,642
the place
and start killin' people.

415
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,440
What you're supposed to do
is act like a professional.

416
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,309
A psychopath
ain't a professional.

417
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,218
You can't work
with a psychopath.

418
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,419
You don't know
what those sick assholes...

419
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,408
are gonna do next.

420
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,125
I mean, Jesus Christ,
how old do you think...

421
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,660
that black girl was? Twenty?

422
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,855
- Maybe 21?
- Lf that.

423
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:23,301
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

424
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,203
Me and Orange
jumped in the car...

425
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,938
Brown floored it.

426
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,374
After that, I don't know
what went down.

427
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,843
It was every man for himself.

428
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,445
As far as Mr. Blonde
and Mr. Blue are concerned...

429
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,446
I ain't got the foggiest...

430
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,481
'cause once I got out,
I never looked back.

431
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,448
What do you think?

432
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,918
What do I think?

433
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,977
The cops either
caught 'em or killed 'em.

434
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,291
No chance they punched
through? You found a hole.

435
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,794
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

436
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,627
But even if they get away,
then where are they?

437
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,067
If one of'em got a hold
of the diamonds and...

438
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:59,002
- No, no way.
- How can you be so sure?

439
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,430
I got the diamonds.

440
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,549
That's my boy.

441
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,688
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

442
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,857
If you wanna come with me,
let's go get 'em...

443
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,459
right now, this second.

444
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,060
'Cause I think
stayin' here, man...

445
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,196
we should have
our fuckin' heads examined.

446
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,298
That was the plan.
We meet here.

447
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,366
Then where the fuck
is everybody?

448
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,568
I say the plan
becomes null and void...

449
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,536
once we found out
we got a rat here.

450
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:32,771
We ain't got
the slightest idea...

451
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,673
what happened
to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.

452
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,708
They could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.

453
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,643
The cops could have 'em
right now at the station...

454
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,078
sweatin' 'em down.

455
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,945
They don't know names, but
they know this place.

456
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,357
I swear to God,
I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.

457
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,553
What?

458
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,300
Twojobs back,
it was a four-man job.

459
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,791
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

460
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,137
No shit?

461
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,077
Thank God
we discovered in time.

462
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,612
We had to forget
the whole thing, just walk...

463
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,170
the fuck away from it.

464
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,476
So who's the rat this time?

465
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,519
Mr. Blue?

466
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,354
Mr. Brown?

467
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,557
Joe? Joe set
this whole thing up.

468
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,892
Maybe he set it up
to set it up.

469
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,760
I don't buy it.

470
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,128
Me and Joe go back
a long time.

471
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,597
I can tell you definitely,
Joe didn't know a thing...

472
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,899
about this bullshit.

473
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,401
I know Joe, and me sayin'
he definitely...

474
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,537
had nothin' to do
with it is ridiculous.

475
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,771
I can say
I definitely didn't do it...

476
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,406
'cause I know
what I did or didn't do.

477
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,908
But I cannot definitely say
that about anybody...

478
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,976
'cause I don't
definitely know.

479
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,145
For all I know, you're the rat.

480
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,581
For all I know,
you're the fuckin' rat!

481
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,017
All right, now you're usin'
your fuckin' head.

482
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,852
For all we know,
he's the rat.

483
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,888
That kid in there is dying
from a fuckin' bullet...

484
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:57,956
I saw him take...

485
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,258
so don't you be calling
him a rat!

486
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,494
Look, I'm right, okay?

487
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,325
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

488
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,430
Where's the commode?
I gotta take a squirt.

489
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,076
Go down the hall, make
a left, go up the stairs...

490
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,668
and make a right.

491
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,586
- By the way, how's Alabama?
- Alabama?

492
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,250
I haven't seen Bama
in over a year and a half.

493
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,952
But I thought you two
were a team.

494
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,899
We were for a little while.

495
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,934
Did about
fourjobs together.

496
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,636
Then decided
to call it quits.

497
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,069
Why?

498
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,309
You push that woman-man
thing too long...

499
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,511
and it gets to you
after a while.

500
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,946
What's she doin' now?

501
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,048
She hooked up
with Frank MacGarr.

502
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,017
They've done
a couplejobs together.

503
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,780
Hell of a woman.
Good little thief.

504
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:08,159
- So explain the telegram.
- Five-man job.

505
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,895
Bustin' in and bustin' out
of a diamond wholesaler's.

506
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,263
Can you move
the ice afterwards?

507
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:13,932
I don't know nobody
that can move ice.

508
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,801
No problem.
We got guys waitin' for it.

509
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,303
What happened
to Marcellus Spivey?

510
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,671
Didn't he
always move your ice?

511
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:22,273
He's doin' 20 years
in Susanville.

512
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:25,477
Twenty years? Holy God.
What for?

513
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,178
Bad luck.

514
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,770
I guess you can say
that again.

515
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,750
What's the exposure like?

516
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,786
Two minutes, tops.
But it's a tough two minutes.

517
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,554
Daylight,
during business hours...

518
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,657
dealing with a crowd.

519
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,759
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

520
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,695
- How many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

521
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,463
Security pretty lax.

522
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,999
They most usually
just deal in boxes.

523
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,036
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.

524
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,271
But on this day,
they're getting a shipment...

525
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,807
of polished stones
from Israel.

526
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,076
They're like a way station,
you know?

527
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,412
They get picked up
and sent to Vermont.

528
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,970
No, they're not.

529
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,018
What's the cut, poppa?

530
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,886
Juicy, junior.
Real juicy.

531
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,994
Look, man,
you do what you want.

532
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,295
I'm outta here, man.
I'm gonna check...

533
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:18,830
into a motel
for a few days.

534
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,991
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe...

535
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,024
Shit.
Did he fuckin' die on us?

536
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,502
Huh?
Is he dead or what?

537
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,538
- He ain't dead.
- What is it?

538
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,515
He scared
the fuckin' shit outta me.

539
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,351
I thought he was dead
for sure.

540
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,876
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

541
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,757
What are we gonna do? We
can't take him to a hospital.

542
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,763
Without medical attention,
he might not live...

543
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,398
through the night.

544
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,600
The bullet in his belly
is my fault.

545
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,469
While that might not mean
jack shit to you...

546
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,604
it means a hell
of a lot to me.

547
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,605
First things first, okay?

548
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,475
Stayin' here's goofy.
We gotta book up.

549
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,077
What do you suggest we do?
Go to a hotel?

550
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,512
We got a guy
who's shot in the belly...

551
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,448
who can't walk,
bleeds like a stuck pig.

552
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,439
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

553
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:16,221
You got an idea, spit it out.

554
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,822
Joe could help.

555
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,258
If we could get in touch
with Joe...

556
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,694
Joe could get him
to a doctor.

557
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,663
Joe could get a doctor
to come to see him.

558
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:28,689
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how we gonna get in touch?

559
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,669
He's supposed to be here,
but he ain't...

560
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,938
which makes me nervous
about bein' here.

561
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,974
Even if he is
on the up and up...

562
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,776
I don't think he's gonna be
too happy with us.

563
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,344
He planned a robbery
and he's got a bloodbath...

564
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,345
on his hands now.

565
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,109
He's got dead cops, dead
robbers, dead civilians.

566
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,651
I tend to doubt he's gonna
have some sympathy for us.

567
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,586
If I was him,
I'd put as much distance...

568
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,248
between me
and this mess as possible.

569
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,896
Before you got here,
Mr. Orange...

570
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:01,559
was askin' me to take him
to a doctor to a hospital.

571
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,838
I don't like the idea of
turnin' him over to cops...

572
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,465
but if we don't,
he's gonna die.

573
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,005
He begged me to do it.

574
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,779
Well, all right.

575
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,181
Then I guess we take him
to a hospital.

576
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,783
If that's what he said,
let's do it.

577
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:19,818
Since he don't know
nothin' about us...

578
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,486
I say it's his decision.

579
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,181
He knows a little about me.

580
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,359
What? Wait, wait.

581
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,761
You didn't tell him
your name, did you?

582
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,786
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

583
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,025
Why?

584
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,836
I told him where I was from
a few days ago.

585
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:42,340
It wasjust
a natural conversation.

586
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,375
You weren't supposed to
tellin' him your name.

587
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,808
He asked.

588
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,314
We had just gotten away
from the cops.

589
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,115
Hejust got shot.

590
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,379
It was my fault
he got shot.

591
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,088
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.

592
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,578
He's screamin'.

593
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,226
I swear to God,
I thought he was gonna die...

594
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,927
right then and there.

595
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,830
I'm tryin' to comfort him...

596
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,898
telling him not to worry...

597
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,132
everything's
going to be okay...

598
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,531
I'm gonna take care of him.

599
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,331
And he asked me
what my name was.

600
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,774
I mean,
the man was dyin' in my arms.

601
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,174
What the fuck
was I supposed to do?

602
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,247
Tell him I'm sorry?

603
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,579
I can't give out
that fuckin' information?

604
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,482
It's against the rules?

605
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,516
I don't trust you enough?

606
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,953
Maybe I should've,
but I couldn't.

607
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,862
Fuck you! Fuck Joe!

608
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,731
I'm sure
it was a beautiful scene.

609
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,765
Don't fuckin' patronize me!

610
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:41,799
I have one question.

611
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,301
Do they have a sheet on you
where you're from?

612
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,737
- Yeah!
- That's that, then.

613
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,673
I was worried about mug
shot possibility as it was.

614
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,242
He knows A, your name,
B, your face...

615
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,044
C, your hometown
and D, your specialty.

616
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,342
They're gonna show him a few
pictures to pick you out!

617
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,949
You didn't tell him
anything else...

618
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,118
so they could narrow
down the selection?

619
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,020
If I have to tell you again
to back off, we're gonna go...

620
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,755
'round and 'round.

621
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,723
We ain't takin' him
to a hospital.

622
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,526
If we don't,
he's gonna die.

623
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,561
And I'm very sad about that,
but some fellas are lucky...

624
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,397
and some ain't.

625
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,024
What the fuck are you
touchin' me for, man?

626
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,839
I'll show you
who you're fuckin' with!

627
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,441
You wanna shoot me,
you piece of shit?

628
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,443
- Go ahead, take a shot.
- Fuck you, White.

629
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,779
I didn't create
this fucking situation!

630
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,480
You're actin'
like a first-year thief!

631
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm actin'
like a professional!

632
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,650
If they get him,
they could get you...

633
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,985
they could get
closer to me...

634
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,954
and that can't happen!

635
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,755
You're lookin' at me
like it's my fault?

636
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:38,790
I didn't tell him my name!

637
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,314
I didn't tell him
where I was from!

638
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,962
Shit! Fifteen minutes ago
you almost told me your name!

639
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,297
You're gonna get stuck
in a situation you created!

640
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,857
So if you wanna throw bad
looks around use a mirror!

641
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,528
You kids shouldn't play
so rough.

642
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,807
Somebody's gonna
start cryin'.

643
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,001
Mr. Blonde.

644
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,542
Shit.
You're fuckin' kickin' me.

645
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,041
What happened to you?

646
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,619
Figured you were dead.

647
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,688
Hey, you okay?

648
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,398
Did you see
what happened to Blue?

649
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,833
We didn't know
what happened to you.

650
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,562
That's what
we were wonderin' about.

651
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,372
Look, Brown is dead...

652
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,073
Orange got it in the belly.

653
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,275
Enough! Enough!

654
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,300
You better start talkin',
asshole.

655
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,343
'Cause we got shit
we need to talk about.

656
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,150
We're already freaked out.

657
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,219
We need you actin' freak
like we need a fuckin'...

658
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,516
bag on our hip.

659
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,090
Okay, let's talk.

660
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,092
We think we got a rat
in the house.

661
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,228
I guarantee we got a rat
in the house.

662
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,596
What makes you say that?

663
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,931
Is that supposed to be funny?

664
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,868
Look, we think
this place ain't safe.

665
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,269
This place ain't secure
anymore.

666
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,338
We're leavin'
and you should go with us.

667
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,771
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

668
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,910
Piss on this fuckin' turd.

669
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,211
We're outta here.

670
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,647
2yDon't take another step,
Mr. White.

671
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,308
Fuck you, maniac!

672
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,388
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

673
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,923
What's this guy's problem?

674
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,358
What's my problem?

675
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,993
Yeah,
I got a fuckin' problem!

676
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,984
I got
a big fuckin' problem...

677
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:28,021
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

678
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,803
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

679
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,672
That fucking shooting spree!

680
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,108
In the store! Remember?

681
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,244
Oh, fuck 'em.
They set off the alarm.

682
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,046
They deserve what they got.

683
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,911
You almost killed me!

684
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,844
Asshole!

685
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,054
If I knew
what kind of guy you were...

686
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,386
I never would've agreed
to work with you.

687
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,022
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

688
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,364
or are you gonna bite?

689
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,626
What was that?

690
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:09,140
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.
Would you repeat it?

691
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,301
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

692
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,946
or are you gonna bite?

693
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,148
You two assholes,
calm the fuck down!

694
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,282
Hey, come on!

695
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,418
What, are we on
a playground here?

696
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,186
Am I the only professional?

697
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,589
You're actin' like
a bunch of fuckin' niggers!

698
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,756
Ever work with niggers?

699
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,892
Always sayin' they're
gonna kill each other.

700
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,827
You said yourself you though
about taking him out.

701
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,497
- You fuckin' said that?
- Yeah, I did, okay?

702
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,664
But that was then.
Right now...

703
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,367
this guy is the only one
I completely trust.

704
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,102
He's too fuck homicidal
to be with the cops.

705
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,471
- You takin' his side?
- Fuck sides, man!

706
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,273
What we need here
is solidarity!

707
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,142
Somebody's stickin' a red-hot
poker up our ass...

708
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,110
and I want to know who.

709
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:51,249
Fuck. Look, I know
I'm no piece of shit.

710
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,418
I'm pretty sure you're okay,
and I'm fuckin' positive...

711
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,087
you're on the level.

712
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,088
So let's try
and figure out...

713
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,715
who the bad guy is,
all right?

714
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,327
Wow.

715
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,386
That was really exciting.

716
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,223
I bet you're a big
Lee Marvin fan, aren't ya?

717
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,529
Yeah, me too.
I love that guy.

718
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,409
My heart's beatin' so fast,

719
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,309
I'm about to have
a heart attack here.

720
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,348
I got
somethin' outside that...

721
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,717
I'd like to show you guys,
so follow me.

722
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,708
Follow you? Where?

723
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,379
To my car.

724
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,891
Did you forget
your French fries...

725
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,026
to go with the soda?

726
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,894
No, I had them already.

727
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,030
I got somethin' I think
you might wanna see, though.

728
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,932
- What?
- It's a big surprise.

729
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,366
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

730
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,980
We still gotta get
outta here, you know.

731
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,716
No. We're gonna stick around
and we're gonna wait.

732
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,186
- What for? The cops?
- No. Nice Guy Eddie.

733
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,121
Nice Guy Eddie?
What makes you think...

734
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,791
he isn't on a plane halfway
to Costa Rica?

735
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,059
Because I spoke to him
on the phone...

736
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,161
and he said
he's on the way down here.

737
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,362
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie?

738
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,464
Why didn't you say
that in the first place?

739
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,334
- 'Cause you never asked me.
- Hardy-fuckin'-har.

740
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,637
- What'd he say?
- He said stay put.

741
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,273
So in the meantime...

742
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,707
I'll show you guys
somethin'.

743
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:30,773
Jesus Christ.

744
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:32,950
Maybe our boy
in blue here...

745
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,318
can answer some
of these questions...

746
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,722
about this rat business
you've been talkin' about.

747
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,212
You're a piece of work,
my friend.

748
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,725
Let's get him
the fuck outta here.

749
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,798
<i>Hey, Sid, will you relax?</i>

750
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,533
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

751
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,336
I know you'll pay me back.

752
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:53,804
Don't tell me
what I already know.

753
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,135
Don't embarrass me.

754
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,843
So you had
a few bad months.

755
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,411
You do
what everybody else does.

756
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,046
I don't care
if it's J.P. Morgan...

757
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,383
or Irving the tailor.
You ride it out.

758
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,052
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Hold on.

759
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,321
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

760
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,990
Tell him to come in.
I gotta go.

761
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,759
- Come on in.
- A friend of mine's outside.

762
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:18,456
I'll be talkin' to you.
Don't worry.

763
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,496
Hey, welcome home, Vic.

764
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,606
How does freedom feel, huh?

765
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,976
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

766
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,144
Sit down,
take your coat off...

767
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,046
make yourself at home.

768
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,814
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.

769
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,917
How about
a little Remy Martin?

770
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,852
Sure.

771
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,184
Who's your parole officer?

772
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,558
Seymour Scagnetti.

773
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,889
How is he?

774
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,263
He's a fuckin' asshole.

775
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,964
Won't even let me
leave the halfway house.

776
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,801
It never ceases to amaze me.

777
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,769
A fuckin' jungle bunny
goes out there...

778
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,072
slits a woman's throat
for 25 cents...

779
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,674
he gets Doris Day
for a parole officer.

780
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,343
A good fella like you...

781
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,811
winds up
with a ball-bustin' prick.

782
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,148
I want you to know
I appreciate...

783
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,517
all the packages
you sent me on the inside.

784
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,252
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

785
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,378
Forget about you?

786
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,857
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

787
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,093
It was the least I could do.

788
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,328
I wish to hell
I could've done a lot more.

789
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,761
Thanks a lot, Joe.

790
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,492
Ah, Vic.

791
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,262
Toothpick Vic.

792
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,034
So tell me your story, kid.

793
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,443
What are your plans?

794
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,911
You son of a bitch.

795
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,880
I see you sittin' there,
but I don't believe it.

796
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,576
- How you doin', Toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.

797
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,722
Listen, I'm sorry.

798
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,357
I should've
picked you up myself.

799
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:56,160
I was... My fuckin'...
This week's been crazy.

800
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,462
I've had my head up my ass
the whole time.

801
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,164
Funny you say that,
'cause that's what...

802
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,599
me and your daddy
were talkin' about.

803
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,601
That I should've
picked you up?

804
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,432
No, that you had
your head up your ass.

805
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,674
I walk in the door,
he's like, "Vic, Vic...

806
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,309
I'm so glad somebody's
finally here...

807
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,512
who knows what's goin' on.

808
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,148
My son Eddie's a fuck-up.

809
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,615
He's ruining the business.

810
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,185
I mean,
I love the guy...

811
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:24,255
but he's flushin'
everything down the toilet".

812
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,450
That's what you said, right?
Tell him yourself.

813
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,428
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this, but...

814
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,988
Vic came in and asked me
how business was.

815
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,533
You don't lie
to a guy who's...

816
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,435
just done four years
in the slammer.

817
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,697
That's very true.

818
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,242
All right,
enough of this shit!

819
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,243
Break it up!

820
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,404
Come on,
this ain't a playground!

821
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,252
You guys wanna
roll around on the floor...

822
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,788
you do it in Eddie's office,
not mine.

823
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,791
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

824
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,659
The guy got me
on the ground...

825
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,260
he tried to fuck me.

826
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,629
- You wish.
- You sick bastard, Vic.

827
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,965
You tried to fuck me
in my father's office.

828
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,633
Look, Vic,
whatever you wanna do...

829
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,302
in the privacy
of your own home...

830
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,303
go to it...

831
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,704
but don't try to fuck me.

832
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,906
I don't think of you
that way.

833
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,074
I like you a lot, buddy...

834
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,871
but I don't think of you
that way.

835
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,448
Listen, if I was
a butt cowboy...

836
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,617
I wouldn't even throw you
to the posse.

837
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:30,254
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.

838
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,256
Four years fuckin' punks
up the ass...

839
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,625
you'd appreciate
a piece of prime rib.

840
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,460
I might break you in,
Nice Guy...

841
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,195
but I'd make you
my dog's bitch.

842
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:39,830
Ain't that
a sad sight, Daddy?

843
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,365
A man walks into prison
a white man...

844
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,000
walks out talkin'
like a fuckin' nigger.

845
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,168
You know what?

846
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,870
I think it's all
that black semen...

847
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,671
pumped up your asshole,
now it's backed...

848
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,367
into your fuckin' brain and
it's comin' out your mouth!

849
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,811
Eddie, you keep talkin'
like a bitch...

850
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,980
I'm gonna slap you
like a bitch.

851
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,516
Enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

852
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,450
Now both of you, sit down.

853
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:06,915
Now, Eddie...

854
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,193
when you came in here...

855
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,196
we were talkin'
some serious business.

856
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,265
Vic here's
got a parole problem.

857
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:17,568
- Who's your P. O?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

858
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,538
Scagnetti. Fuck.

859
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,938
- I hear he's a mother-fucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

860
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,543
Won't even let me leave
the halfway house...

861
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,878
unless I get
some shitty job.

862
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,709
You're comin' back
to work for us, right?

863
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,286
Well, I wanna.

864
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,488
But first
I gotta prove to, uh...

865
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,089
ass-head that
I can get...

866
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,659
a regular, you know,
job-typejob...

867
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,559
before I can move out
on my own.

868
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,397
I can't come back
to work for you guys...

869
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,365
if I gotta worry about...

870
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,467
makin' some silly-ass
10 o'clock curfew...

871
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:51,627
every fuckin' night.

872
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,104
We can work this out,
can't we, Eddie?

873
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,175
This ain't all that bad.

874
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,478
We can get you
a lot of legitimatejobs.

875
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:04,281
I'll get you down in
Long Beach as a dockworker.

876
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,685
I don't wanna lift
no fuckin' crates, Eddie.

877
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,353
You ain't gonna lift shit.

878
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,255
You don't even work there.

879
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,291
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

880
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,061
I call Matthews and tell him
he's got a new guy, boom...

881
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,862
you're on the rotation.

882
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:19,964
You get a time card.

883
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,333
It's clocked in and out
for you every day.

884
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,168
At the end of the week
you get a nice paycheck.

885
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,704
Dockworkers do very well.

886
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,472
You can move
into a halfway decent place...

887
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:29,640
without Scagnetti goin'...

888
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,009
"Where the fuck's the money
comin' from?"

889
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:35,579
And, if he decides
to make a surprise visit...

890
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,548
that's the day
we sent you to Tustin...

891
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,150
to pick up a load of shit.

892
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,352
If he comes back again...

893
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:45,022
hey, "Sorry, Seymour.
You just missed him.

894
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:48,559
We send him to the Taft
airstrip five hours away.

895
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,294
We had a load of shit
he had to pick up there...

896
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,328
and bring back here".

897
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,564
Part of yourjob
is goin' different places.

898
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:54,999
That's the beauty of it.

899
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,694
We got places
all over the place.

900
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:00,070
See, Vic? Did I tell you
not to worry?

901
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,172
Vic was worried.

902
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,108
I'll take you
to Long Beach tomorrow.

903
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,309
We'll get you fixed up
with Matthews...

904
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,833
I'll tell him what's what.

905
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,382
You know,
I really appreciate...

906
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,383
what you guys are doin'...

907
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,252
but I'd like to know
when I can come back...

908
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,155
you know,
do some real work.

909
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,557
Well, it's hard to say.

910
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,548
It's kind of
a strange time now.

911
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:24,862
Things are kind of...

912
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,126
They're a little fucked up,
is what they are.

913
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:29,566
We'rejust gettin' ready...

914
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,935
for a big meetin'
right now in Vegas.

915
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:36,373
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

916
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,841
Get you ajob...

917
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,643
give you some cash...

918
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:42,980
and get this Scagnetti
fuck off your back...

919
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,073
and then we'll talk to you,
all right?

920
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,284
Huh?

921
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:51,355
Dad, I got an idea.

922
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,913
Just hear me out.

923
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,425
I know you don't like usin'
the boys on thesejobs...

924
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,329
but Vic here, I mean...

925
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:02,232
he's only been nothin'
but good luck for us.

926
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:03,701
The guy's
a fuckin' rabbit's foot...

927
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,827
for cryin' out loud.

928
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,572
I'd like to have him in.

929
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:09,773
You know
he can handle himself...

930
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,173
and you damn sure know
you can trust him.

931
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,046
All right, Vic...

932
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,115
how would you feel about
pullin' ajob...

933
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,913
with about five other guys?

934
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,879
I'd feel great about it.

935
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:33,297
<i>K- BILL Y's "Super Sounds</i>
<i>of the '70s"continues.</i>

936
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,499

944
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,080
Hey, Dov, we got
a major situation here.

945
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,260
I know you know that.
I gotta talk to Daddy...

946
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,727
and find out
what he wants done.

947
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,338
All I know
is what Vic told me.

948
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:17,107
The place turned
into a bullet-fest.

949
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,643
He took a cop hostage
just to get outta there.

950
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,907
Get up! Get up!

951
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,884
Do I sound like
I'm fuckin' jokin'?

952
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,444
He's fuckin' drivin' around
with a cop in his trunk!

953
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:36,026
I don't know who did what!

954
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,828
I don't know
who's got the loot.

955
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,196
I don't know
if anybody's got the loot.

956
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,197
I don't know who's dead...

957
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:42,927
who's alive,
who's caught, who's not.

958
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,777
I will know.
I'm practically there now.

959
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,513
But what do I tell
these guys about Daddy?

960
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,526
All right.

961
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:10,993
You sure
that's what he said?

962
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,824
Okay, that's what
I'll tell 'em.

963
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,301
Huh? Fuck you!

964
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:18,402
You like bein'
a fuckin' hero?

965
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,803
You like bein'
a fuckin' hero?

966
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,600
You like bein'
a fuckin' hero?

967
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,606
You're gonna suffer
for nothin', pal.

968
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:30,080
You hear me? 'Cause you're
gonna fuckin' talk.

969
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,116
- I don't know anything!
- You fuckin' know.

970
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,752
You know. Look at me.
You fuckin' know.

971
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:37,720
What in the Sam Hill's
goin' on here?

972
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,246
- Nice Guy, we got a cop.
- Where the fuck is Joe?

973
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,095
Holy shit. Orange is dead.

974
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,563
No, he's not dead...

975
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,765
but he will be if we don't
get him taken care of.

976
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:49,733
We were set up.

977
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,201
The cops were there
waitin' for us.

978
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,403
What? Nobody fuckin'
set anybody up.

979
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,205
The cops were there
waitin' for us.

980
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,140
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you, man!

981
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,076
You weren't there,
we were, and the cops had...

982
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:00,644
that store staked out.

983
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:04,214
Okay, Mr. Fuckin' Detective,
you're so fuckin' smart.

984
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,917
- Who did it?
- We've been askin' each other!

985
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,485
What'd you come up with?

986
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,988
You think
I fuckin' set you up?

987
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,115
I don't know,
but somebody did.

988
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,759
Nobody did.

989
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,761
You fuckin' assholes
turned thejewelry store...

990
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,529
Don't you call me
an asshole!

991
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:20,697
You fuckin' idiot!

992
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,066
Turned thejewelry store
into a wild west show...

993
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,591
and you wonder why
the fuckin' cops show up?

994
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,006
Where's Joseph?

995
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,941
I don't know.
I ain't talked to him.

996
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,009
I talked to Dov.

997
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,510
He says
Daddy's comin' down here...

998
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,345
and he's fuckin' pissed.

999
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:38,315
He's pissed?
I told you he'd be pissed.

1000
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,349
What'd Joe say?

1001
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,418
I told you,
I ain't talked to him!

1002
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,253
All I know is he's pissed.

1003
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,155
What are you gonna do
about him?

1004
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,090
Give me a fuckin' chance
to breathe.

1005
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,725
I got a few questions
of my own here.

1006
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,260
You ain't dying. He is.

1007
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,329
All right,
Mr. Fuckin' Compassion...

1008
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,799
- I will call somebody-Who?

1009
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,200
A fuckin' snake charmer!

1010
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,202
Who do you think?
I'll call a doctor.

1011
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,038
They'll fix him right up.

1012
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,473
What happened
to Brown and Blue?

1013
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,274
Brown's dead.

1014
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,609
We don't know
what happened to Blue.

1015
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,278
Brown's dead?
Are you sure?

1016
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,481
I'm sure. I was there.
He took one in the head.

1017
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,717
Nobody's got a clue
what happened to Mr. Blue?

1018
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,719
Either he's alive
or he's dead...

1019
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:19,052
or the cops got him
or they don't.

1020
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,661
I take it, this is the
bastard you told me about.

1021
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,630
Why are you beatin'
on him?

1022
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,699
Maybe he could tell us
who set us up.

1023
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,034
You beat
this prick long enough...

1024
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,403
he'll tell you
he started the Chicago Fire.

1025
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,573
Now that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

1026
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,508
Come on, man, think!

1027
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:39,609
All right...

1028
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,979
first things fuckin' last.

1029
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:42,980
Who's got the stones?

1030
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,650
Please, somebody tell me
one little fuckin' favor.

1031
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,318
I got a bag.

1032
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,187
Okay? I stashed it
'til we could be sure...

1033
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,356
this place wasn't
a police station.

1034
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:53,657
Good for you.

1035
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,725
Now let's go get it.

1036
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,393
First we gotta get
rid of those cars.

1037
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,224
It looks like
Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.

1038
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,497
Okay.

1039
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,465
Blondie...

1040
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,667
stay here
and baby-sit them two.

1041
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,770
White and Pink,
take a car each.

1042
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,507
I'll follow you, you ditch
'em. Pick up the stones.

1043
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,375
While I'm followin' you...

1044
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,744
I'll arrange some sort
of a doctor for our friend.

1045
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:16,213
You can't leave these guys
here with him.

1046
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,347
Why not?

1047
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,250
Because
he's a fuckin' psycho.

1048
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,619
And if you think
Joe's pissed off...

1049
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:23,620
that ain't nothin' compared...

1050
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,555
to how pissed off
I am at him...

1051
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,989
for puttin' me in the same
room as that bastard.

1052
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,429
You see what I've been
puttin' up with, Eddie?

1053
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,431
I fuckin' walked in here...

1054
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:37,534
I told these guys
about stayin' put.

1055
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,369
Mr. White whips out his gun...

1056
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,670
he's stickin' it
in my face...

1057
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,572
callin' me a mother-fucker...

1058
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,541
sayin' he's gonna
blow me away...

1059
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,877
and blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

1060
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:47,878
He's the reason...

1061
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,181
thejoint turned
into a shootin' spree.

1062
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,949
What are you,
a fuckin' silent partner?

1063
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,918
Tell him!

1064
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:58,822
He went crazy in the store,
but he seems all right now.

1065
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:02,526
This is what he was doin':
Bam, bam...

1066
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,961
bam, bam.

1067
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:07,631
Yeah, bam, bam,
bam, bam, bam.

1068
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,867
I told 'em not to touch
the fuckin' alarm, they did.

1069
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:14,171
If they hadn't have done
what I told 'em not to do...

1070
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,604
they'd still be alive.

1071
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,838
My fuckin' hero.
