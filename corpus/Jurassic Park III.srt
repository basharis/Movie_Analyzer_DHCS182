2
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:11,406
Better hurry.

3
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:23,800
Here you go, my friend.

4
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:26,321
Make sure you get us as close as you can!

5
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:29,558
I'll give you something extra
if you make it a good trip.

6
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:33,044
I'm going to get you close,
but not too close.

7
00:01:33,247 --> 00:01:35,044
You don't want to be eaten.

8
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:38,361
- Ready, amigo?
- Ready!

9
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:46,005
One, two, three!

11
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,125
Eric, heave!

13
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,355
Scared?

14
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:12,526
This is great.

15
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:26,205
See anything yet?

16
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,079
No, not yet.

19
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,804
- What was that?
- I don't know.

21
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:03,123
Hold on!

22
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:05,596
- What's happening?
- Just hold on!

23
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,605
Make it stop!

24
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:14,880
What happened to them?

25
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:18,846
I don't know. Oh, my God.

26
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,397
- We're going to crash!
- No, we're not.

27
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:24,525
I'm going to take this loose!

28
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,518
- Let go of the rope!
- We're gonna crash!

29
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:29,879
Move your hands!

30
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:31,721
Come on!

31
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,846
Here we go!

32
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:47,406
It's going be okay, bud.

33
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:10,516
Charlie, those are herbivores.
They wouldn't fight each other.

34
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:13,917
But these are carnivores,
and they really like fighting each other.

35
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:17,716
They use their teeth and their claws
to rip each other's throats out.

36
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:21,325
Alan, he's three. Let's wait till he's five.

37
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,005
Right. Sorry, Charlie.

38
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,282
- Ellie?
- Yeah?

39
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:28,518
It's Tom. He says he has to talk to you
about the last chapter.

40
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:32,919
Tell him I won't lose the Horner quote.
My editor thinks he's a paleontologist.

41
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:35,001
Hey, Mark!

42
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:37,521
Hey, babe, look who's here.

43
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:40,560
This is Alan.

44
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,236
Nice to meet you, Alan.

45
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:46,876
Daddy, this is a herbivore
and that's the dinosaur man.

46
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,639
Dinosaur man?

47
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:52,159
Jack, say my name. Is my name Alan?

48
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:54,405
Is my name Alan?

50
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:58,999
He used to know me.

51
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:03,277
- It's sad, huh?
- Here you go.

52
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:06,919
Thanks. Mark's been working
for the State Department now.

53
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,157
What do they do, Mark?

54
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:12,325
International relations,
mostly treaty law, things like that.

56
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,004
- Call of the wild one.
- I'll go.

57
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:19,397
You guys catch up.

58
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,000
Thanks, babe.

59
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:24,719
He's a great guy.

60
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:28,925
- So, what are you working on now?
- Raptors, mostly.

61
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,160
My favourite.

62
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,397
Do you remember the sounds they made?

63
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:36,006
I try not to.

64
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,442
All our theories about Raptor intelligence...

65
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:41,360
...what they were capable of,
we weren't even close.

66
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:44,086
- Tell me.
- We did cranial scans of a fossil skull...

67
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:47,637
...and found what looks to be
a very sophisticated resonating chamber.

68
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:49,604
Wait a second. So we were right.

69
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:53,236
- They'd the ability to vocalise.
- lt's the key to their social intelligence.

70
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,397
Which explains
why they could work as a team.

71
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:58,957
They'd coordinate attacks so their prey
wouldn't know what was going on.

72
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:02,278
- They could talk to each other.
- To a degree we never imagined.

74
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:04,926
Ellie, they were smart.

75
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:07,760
They were smarter
than dolphins or whales.

76
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:10,682
They were smarter than primates.

77
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:20,319
I just wanted to say, if you ever need help,
sometimes you forget to ask.

78
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,478
So you can call me. Anything, anytime.

79
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:26,401
Sure.

81
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:32,399
You're still the best.

82
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:34,520
I mean that.

83
00:06:35,887 --> 00:06:37,684
The last of my breed.

84
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:49,560
It is through the study of the
anterior chamber in multiple specimens...

85
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:54,402
...that we can determine the correlation
between the upper palate and the larynx.

86
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:57,240
This lets us theorise, theorise, mind you...

87
00:06:57,327 --> 00:07:01,081
...that the Raptor was capable
of sophisticated vocalizations...

88
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:04,557
...which would have been
a tremendous evolutionary advantage.

89
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:07,281
Raptors were fierce, intelligent...

90
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,039
...and socially sophisticated.

91
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:12,676
They were able to hunt in numbers
and coordinate their efforts.

92
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:16,805
Were it not for the cataclysmic events
which overtook them...

93
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:19,845
...it's entirely possible
that Raptors rather than humans...

94
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:23,237
...would have become
the dominant species on this planet.

95
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:25,923
I hope this has been of interest.

96
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:29,044
It certainly excites us as paleontologists.

97
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,996
There is much more to discover.

98
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:36,319
That is why we continue to need,
and ask for, your support.

99
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:42,160
Thank you.

101
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:53,723
Thank you very much, Dr. Grant.

102
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:56,242
Now, does anyone have a question?

103
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:03,279
Fine. Does anyone have a question
that does not relate to Jurassic Park?

104
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:08,041
Or the incident in San Diego...

105
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,642
...which I did not witness?

106
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,516
Yes, sir?

107
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:19,558
Your theory on Raptors is good,
but isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

108
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:23,845
Once the U.N. and Costa Rica and everyone
decide how to handle that second island...

109
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:26,600
...scientists will just go in
and look for themselves.

110
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:30,123
Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.

111
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,165
What is left of them is fossilised...

112
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:35,716
...in the rocks. And it is in the rock...

113
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,321
...that real scientists make real discoveries.

114
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:41,763
What John Hammond and Ingen
did at Jurassic Park...

115
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:45,444
...is create genetically engineered
theme park monsters.

116
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:48,121
Nothing more and nothing less.

117
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:51,046
Are you saying
you wouldn't want to visit Isla Sorna...

118
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:53,561
...and study them if you had the chance?

119
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:56,317
No force on Earth or Heaven...

120
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:58,678
...could get me on that island.

121
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:12,004
What we got here, Nashy?

122
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:14,846
Einhorn 20-millimetre,
gas-operated semi-automatic.

123
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:18,044
10-shot, magazine fed,
rotating bolt recoil-reducing muzzle brake.

125
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:20,082
High explosive...

126
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,842
Udesky.

127
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:32,164
- It's Paul Kirby. Just checking...
- Yes, sir.

128
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:34,039
We're good to go here.

129
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:38,839
Matter of fact, I can lock things down
just as soon as you drop me that payment.

130
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,079
Well, that's right...

131
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,965
...two of the very best men
I could possibly find.

132
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:50,077
No, I haven't worked
with them personally...

133
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:54,240
...but believe me, sir, both of these men
come very highly recommended.

134
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:04,884
- Are you all right?
- Nothing to worry about, sir.

135
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:07,443
It's gonna be a walk in the park.

136
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:18,801
Billy, I don't think
I'm doing this right.

137
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,923
Let's try the toothbrush.

138
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:32,759
You've got to go slowly.

139
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:36,318
Just take a little bit at a time.

140
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:39,285
I can never tell what's rock
and what's bone.

141
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:41,239
Technically, it's all rock.

142
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:44,478
The calcium in the bones
is replaced during fossilization.

143
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:47,242
But you can feel the difference. See?

144
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,320
Rough...

145
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,480
...smooth.

146
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:54,203
Rough, smooth.

147
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,126
Dr. Grant.

148
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:04,236
Mr. Brennan.

149
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:06,438
So, how did it go?

150
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:10,005
Well, it's not too late
to change your major, Billy.

151
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:12,598
- That good, huh?
- Worse.

152
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:14,439
We'll to have to pack up in four weeks.

153
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:15,846
Three.

154
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,844
I had to rent some equipment.

155
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:20,003
Come here. I got to show you something.

156
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:23,284
- You like computers, right?
- I like the abacus, Billy.

157
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:25,803
Meet the future of paleontology.

158
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:28,037
It's a rapid prototyper.

159
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,917
I enter the scanned data
from the Raptor skull.

160
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:33,680
The computer breaks it down
into thousands of slices.

161
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:37,476
And this thing sculpts it,
one layer at a time.

162
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,562
It's done.

163
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:52,524
I give you the resonating chamber
of a Velociraptor.

164
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,520
Listen to this.

166
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:06,966
Wow.

167
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,927
This is brilliant, Billy. Really, it is.

168
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:12,237
Sad to say, it's just a little bit late.

169
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:16,077
Dr. Grant? Paul Kirby, Kirby Enterprises.

170
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:19,037
My card. How you doing, Billy?

171
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,237
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?

172
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:26,837
First thing, I'm a great admirer of yours.

173
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:29,760
And I have a proposition
I'd like to discuss with you.

174
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:32,441
Would you have dinner
with my wife and me this evening?

175
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:35,280
- lt'll be our treat.
- That'd be great but...

176
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:38,325
...l'm tired, I've been travelling.
Maybe some other time.

177
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:40,602
Believe me, this will be worth your while.

178
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:44,043
- We'd love to.
- Oh, terrific! That's the spirit. Good.

179
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:45,840
This evening then.

181
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:57,165
Billy, thank you for coming.
Dr. Grant, how are you?

182
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:59,920
Amanda, this is Billy and Dr. Grant.

183
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:01,440
Mrs. Kirby, how are you?

184
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:03,199
What are you boys drinking?

185
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:06,761
- lce Pick, Catfish.
- Two, please, Cat.

186
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:10,522
- We've admired your work for years.
- Really. Truly inspiring.

187
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:12,763
Amanda and I just love the outdoors.

188
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:16,237
We've been on nearly every adventure tour
they can come up with:

189
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:19,080
The Nile, Galapagos, K2.

190
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:23,046
We even have two seats reserved
on the first commercial flight to the moon.

191
00:13:23,127 --> 00:13:26,915
For our wedding anniversary this year,
we wanted to do something really special.

192
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,316
- Something...
- Once in a lifetime.

193
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:33,118
I've chartered an airplane
to fly us over Isla Sorna.

194
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:35,277
And we'd like you to be our guide.

195
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:38,998
There you go, guys.

196
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:44,282
That's a very kind offer, Mr. Kirby,
but I'm a very, very busy man.

197
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:47,564
I can recommend a couple of guys
who are really highly qualified...

198
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,400
No, no. You're the best.

199
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:54,566
You've seen these animals in the flesh.
There's no one who comes close to you.

200
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:58,276
You wouldn't be able to fly low enough
to see anything of any real interest.

201
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:02,519
That's the interesting part,
because we have permission to fly low.

202
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:03,922
How low?

203
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:08,361
I'm no aviation expert, but a heck
of a lot lower than anybody else.

204
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,962
From what I understand,
it's pretty much whatever we want.

205
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:14,366
That's hard to believe.

206
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:17,883
Through my business dealings,
import-export, emerging markets...

207
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:20,197
...l've made a lot of friends in high places.

208
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:22,926
In this case, the Costa Rican government.

209
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,523
Dr. Grant, you have no idea...

210
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:29,236
...how important it is that you come along.
It would make all the difference.

211
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,442
Mrs. Kirby, I...

212
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:34,486
And, of course, we'd love to make
a contribution to your research here.

213
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,122
So...

214
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:41,197
...I could write all kinds of numbers
on this cheque, Dr. Grant.

215
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:43,206
Tell me...

216
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,203
...what's it gonna take?

217
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:03,565
Even with what I pay you,
couldn't you afford a better bag?

218
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:04,966
No way.

219
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:06,999
This one's lucky.

220
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,643
Couple of years ago,
some buddies and I went hang gliding...

221
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,558
...off these cliffs in New Zealand.

222
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:17,243
And this big updraft came and swept me
right against the side. Wham!

223
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:19,557
That does sound lucky.

224
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:22,685
It was this strap alone that saved my life.

225
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:25,043
Got hooked on a rock as I was falling.

226
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:28,676
Reverse Darwinism.
Survival of the most idiotic.

227
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:34,277
Alan, I want to thank you
for bringing me along.

228
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:36,723
The bones will still be there
when we get back.

229
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:39,879
That's the great thing about bones.
They never run away.

230
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:43,603
And truth is, you got me into this.

231
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:48,317
And I have no intention
of being on my own with these people.

232
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:53,400
Don't get too excited.

233
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,921
Chances are, we won't see a thing.

234
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:58,159
Your turn to be nice.

235
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:00,358
Wake me when we get there.

236
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:09,043
So how do you know the Kirbys?

237
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:12,118
Through our church.

239
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,156
Alan.

240
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:34,126
Alan!

241
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,722
Wake up. We're almost there.

242
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,805
MAN ON RADIO: Unidentified aircraft
approaching Isla Sorna...

243
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:57,038
...this is San Juan Approach.
You're flying in restricted airspace.

244
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:58,765
Immediately turn to coordinates two...

247
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:49,358
My God, I had forgotten.

248
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,677
We did it, honey. We're here.

249
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:07,086
Cooper! if you see anything, yell up!

250
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:09,362
No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

251
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:11,955
Everyone, if you look out the left
of the plane...

252
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,481
...you can see
a whole herd of Brachiosaurus.

253
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:18,116
In fact, you can see at the front
of the group the alpha male grazing there.

254
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:20,960
Udesky? Nash? How about up front?
You guys see anything?

255
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:22,765
Nothing yet, Mr. Kirby.

256
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:24,606
Mrs. Kirby, look!

257
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,359
Out here, you'll see a group of...

258
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:29,439
Mr. Kirby, we have a landing strip.
You want me to put her down?

259
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:32,599
No! I told you, 
I want to circle first, see the whole island.

260
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,439
What do you mean? You can't land!

261
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:36,279
Hold on. I can explain...

262
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,323
You cannot land on this island!

263
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,716
- It will be fine.
- Don't worry, please.

264
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,839
- Are you crazy?
- Sit down!

265
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:45,963
Will you please sit down?

266
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:56,601
Billy...

267
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:58,964
...tell me we didn't land.

268
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:00,999
Eric!

269
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:04,196
Ben!

270
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:06,437
I think they're looking for someone.

271
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:09,481
Ben!

272
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:18,723
Dr. Grant, are you all right?

273
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:22,004
- I'm sorry we had to be so rough.
- Who hit me? Who hit me?

274
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,243
That would be Cooper.

275
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:26,036
What are they doing?

276
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:28,322
Setting up a perimeter
to make the place safe.

277
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:31,365
Trust me, on this island,
there's no such thing as safe!

278
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:33,244
We have to get back on that plane!

279
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:36,956
Tell your wife to stop making that noise!
That is a very, very bad idea!

280
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,117
- Amanda!
- Ben!

281
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:42,597
Honey, Dr. Grant said
that's a bad idea!

282
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:44,202
What?

283
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:46,881
He says it's a bad idea!

284
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:48,595
What's a bad idea?

286
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:52,600
What was that?

287
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:53,916
That's a Tyrannosaurus.

289
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,765
I don't think so. It sounds bigger.

290
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:04,160
We have to leave! We have to leave now!

291
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:06,483
Get on the plane!

292
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:08,879
Get on the plane!

293
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:14,357
- What about the other guy?
- Cooper's a professional.

294
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,436
He can handle himself.

297
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:18,922
Get on the plane!

298
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:20,999
It's all right.

300
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:33,684
- Paul, we can't...
- lt's all right.

301
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:34,882
We'll circle the island.

302
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,680
Give me a hand, Udesky!

303
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:55,357
Stop!

304
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:56,516
What are you doing?

305
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:57,643
That's Cooper!

306
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:00,600
Stop.

307
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:02,439
Come on, get out of the way!

308
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,760
You know I can't stop this plane.

309
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:08,402
Oh, my God!

310
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:13,080
- Fuel cut-off!
- We're going down!

312
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:38,601
You okay?

313
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,198
We're okay up here.

314
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:43,563
Everyone, just stay put.

315
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,958
San Juan Approach. Mayday, mayday!

316
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:47,878
Who has the satellite phone?

317
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:50,481
I do. I got it right here.

318
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:53,167
We're not getting anything.
The radio's gone.

319
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,966
We haven't landed yet.

320
00:22:06,127 --> 00:22:08,846
- All circuits are busy.
- Damn it! Oh, man.

322
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,202
What was that?

324
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:16,601
Keep still! Keep still!

325
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:19,440
Relax. What is it? What?

326
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:22,843
- What is it?
- Hold it!

327
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:26,404
Hang on, everyone!

332
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:47,006
Help me!

336
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:46,799
Mrs. Kirby, come back!

337
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:50,236
Amanda!

339
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:36,437
Follow me! This way!

340
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:45,435
In here!

343
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,400
I think we lost him.

345
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:26,805
It's okay, it's dead.

347
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,282
Nobody move a muscle.

351
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:33,639
No, no! Please, don't! Stop, please.

352
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:37,401
It's time you did some explaining,
Mr. Kirby.

353
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,436
We called everyone.
We did everything we could.

354
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:44,315
No one would help us. The Costa Rican
government said this is a no-fly zone.

355
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:47,479
The U.S. Embassy,
that's our U.S. Embassy...

356
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:50,604
...told us we should accept the inevitable.
Can you believe that?

357
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:52,803
You let a 12-year-old
go parasailing alone?

358
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:55,481
- No!
- He was with a friend.

359
00:26:55,607 --> 00:26:57,325
Ben Hildebrand.

360
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,637
Paul and I divorced over a year ago.

361
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:01,120
All right, why me?

362
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:03,960
He said we needed someone
who'd been on the island before.

363
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:07,084
Yes, but I did not tell you
to kidnap somebody.

364
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,995
I have never been on this island.

365
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:12,363
Sure you have. You wrote that book.

366
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:16,360
That was Isla Nublar.
This is Isla Sorna, Site B.

367
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:18,802
You mean there are two islands
with dinosaurs?

368
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,959
- Stay out of this.
- How long have they been missing?

369
00:27:22,047 --> 00:27:24,436
- Eight weeks.
- Almost eight weeks now.

370
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:29,680
Billy. We'll go back to the plane,
salvage what we can.

371
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:31,359
Then we make for the coast.

372
00:27:31,447 --> 00:27:34,883
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving this island
without our son.

373
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,318
Then you can go and look for him.

374
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,126
Or you can stick with us,
as long as you don't hold us up.

375
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:41,401
Either way...

376
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,920
...you probably won't get off
this island alive.

377
00:27:55,727 --> 00:27:57,718
So? What do we do?

378
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:00,964
We search for your son...

379
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:05,036
...in the direction that they're going.

380
00:28:06,247 --> 00:28:07,600
Excellent.

381
00:28:32,407 --> 00:28:33,681
PAUL: Sorry.

382
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:37,081
It's nothing you haven't seen before, Paul.

383
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:41,161
How much weight
did you say you lost?

384
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:44,045
About 25 pounds. I've been swimming.

385
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:47,923
Swimming? You hate to swim.
You don't even know how to swim.

386
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:49,759
I know. I learned.

387
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,917
- You look good.
- So do you.

389
00:28:57,047 --> 00:28:59,607
- How would you classify it, Billy?
- Well...

390
00:29:00,287 --> 00:29:02,323
...it's a super-predator.

391
00:29:04,647 --> 00:29:06,239
A Suchomimus.

392
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:09,037
- That snout.
- No, think bigger.

393
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:11,517
- Baryonyx?
- Not with that sail.

394
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:15,083
Spinosaurus aegypticus.

395
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:21,403
- I don't remember that on Ingen's list.
- Because it wasn't on their list.

396
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:24,285
And it makes you wonder
what else they were up to.

397
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:38,605
So, Mr. Kirby, tell me.
When you climbed K2...

398
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:41,997
...did you base camp
at 25,000 or 30,000 feet?

399
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:46,446
30,000 feet.
We were pretty close to the top.

400
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:49,121
You were about 1,000 feet above it,
actually.

401
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:52,717
No, that's a common mistake.

402
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:56,717
There's no such thing
as Kirby Enterprises, is there?

403
00:29:58,167 --> 00:30:02,126
It's Kirby Paint and Tile Plus.
The "Plus" stands for bathroom fixtures.

404
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:04,801
We're in the Westgate Shopping Centre,
Enid, Oklahoma...

405
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,799
I don't suppose that cheque
you wrote us is any good.

406
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:11,044
- I will pay you the money I owe you.
- This is good.

407
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:15,716
Here we are, in the worst place
in the world, and we're not being paid!

408
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:17,718
Wait, fellas. Hold on!

409
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:19,399
I'll make this up to you.

410
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:22,285
If you ever do a bathroom or a kitchen...

411
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,564
- You're not a mercenary, are you?
- I never said I was.

412
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,797
That's true. What are you?

413
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:33,719
I'm like a booking agent. One of the guys
got sick and couldn't come.

414
00:30:34,287 --> 00:30:35,845
Excuse me. Here.

415
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:39,446
- So you run a hardware store?
- Paint and tile, yeah.

416
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:43,124
- You never can tell about people, can you?
- Ain't that the truth?

417
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:45,959
- Eric!
- Quiet.

418
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:47,275
Would you stop that?

419
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,881
Dr. Grant says
this is very dangerous territory.

420
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:51,559
Maybe we should split up.

421
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:54,684
- We could cover twice as much.
- Dr. Grant says that's a bad idea.

422
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:55,995
Dr. Grant says this...

423
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,840
Why hire an expert
if we don't use his advice?

424
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:01,236
Except Dr. Grant isn't looking for Eric.

425
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,795
- He's looking for the coast.
- Go ahead and scream.

426
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:07,004
When that "Tricycloplots" attacks you,
don't come crying to me.

427
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:10,363
- Don't worry about that.
- What? What did you say?

428
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:13,439
- What did you say?
- Never mind! Paul, just drop it!

429
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:16,564
If we split up, I'm going with you guys.

430
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:29,119
- Eric!
- Eric!

431
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:31,516
- Mrs. Kirby! Mrs. Kirby!
- Eric!

432
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:36,602
Mrs. Kirby, the chances are remote
they're still in the vicinity.

433
00:31:42,687 --> 00:31:44,006
Young adult.

434
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:47,526
Hey, guys!

435
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:55,285
That's my camera.

436
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,000
The battery's dead.

437
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,918
I've got an idea.

438
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,444
Let me have the camera.

439
00:32:07,687 --> 00:32:10,247
Where were you on that one, Ma?

440
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:13,721
Okay, dive. Dive.

441
00:32:15,887 --> 00:32:17,081
Come on, Ma.

442
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,727
- Eric.
- Ma, you were supposed to catch itl

443
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,641
I shot this the morning they disappeared.

444
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:25,327
I want that. Let me take that.

445
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:27,557
Come on, give me that. Come on, baby.

446
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:29,479
See anything yet?

447
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:31,523
No, not yet!

448
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:34,046
What was that?

449
00:32:35,647 --> 00:32:36,966
Unclip us.

450
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:40,596
- There's a big clip!
- I can't see. I can't do it!

451
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:44,964
I'm going to unhook you, all right?

452
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,720
One, two, three!

453
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:52,124
Are you okay, buddy?
I'm gonna drop myself down now.

454
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:54,885
The camera's still on.

455
00:32:57,647 --> 00:33:00,320
He's alive. I know he's alive.

456
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:02,245
We're gonna find him.

457
00:33:04,687 --> 00:33:06,643
Can you fly one of those?

458
00:33:06,807 --> 00:33:08,286
Maybe.

459
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:10,358
As long as the sail is not torn.

460
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,199
Well, let's take it.

461
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,717
If we spot a plane,
it might be a good way to get attention.

462
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:17,644
Pull it over this way.

465
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,686
I got it, hold on! Okay. Okay.

466
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:30,200
My God!

467
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:38,757
Okay, you're free.

468
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:43,163
Get her back, Mr. Kirby!

469
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:44,760
Amanda!

470
00:33:45,287 --> 00:33:46,322
Wait!

472
00:33:57,207 --> 00:33:58,799
Amanda!

473
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:08,483
Amanda, stop.

474
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:12,804
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about Ben.

475
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,882
It's not Ben, Paul.

476
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:21,965
It's Eric. He's out there all by himself.

477
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:24,999
I know, I know.

478
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:28,204
Our baby is out here all by himself.

479
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:30,876
Listen to me. We'll find him.

480
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:32,202
I promise.

481
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:41,241
Paul.

482
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:46,319
Dr. Grant!

483
00:34:47,047 --> 00:34:49,277
You should come look at this!

485
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,198
Raptor.

486
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:33,720
We're going to find him.

487
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:36,241
Are you listening to me?
We're going to find him.

488
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:37,999
Kid's got resources.

489
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:40,760
Remember what it was like
to try to ground him?

490
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:44,365
Where's Billy?

491
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:51,805
What are you doing?

492
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:53,918
I was photographing the nest.

493
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,805
Don't do that again.

494
00:35:56,527 --> 00:35:57,721
I'm sorry.

495
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,605
If I lose you,
it's just me and the damn tourists.

496
00:36:10,287 --> 00:36:11,845
I bet you Eric is in there.

497
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:14,361
Don't you think? I'd bet my bottom dollar!

498
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,679
What do you think it is?

499
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:20,998
As far as I'm concerned,
it's the Four Seasons.

500
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,600
- Eric!
- Paul! Don't.

501
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,445
What the hell.

503
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:27,998
Who's got some change?
It only takes quarters.

504
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:30,442
I've got $1.10.

507
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:25,118
This is how you make dinosaurs?

508
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:26,801
No.

509
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:29,843
This is how you play God.

512
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:25,036
This way!

513
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:31,001
It's locked!

514
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:36,882
- This way, this way!
- Go! Go!

516
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,558
Hey, over here!

518
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:03,119
Push, push!

520
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:13,686
My God.

521
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:16,679
He's calling for help.

522
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,566
Come on!

526
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:42,245
Into the herd!

529
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,646
Head for the trees!

532
00:41:37,447 --> 00:41:38,197
Udesky.

535
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:58,486
Mr. Kirby!

536
00:41:59,927 --> 00:42:02,043
- Billy?
- ls Alan with you?

537
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:10,800
Oh, my God.

538
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:12,286
Mr. Udesky!

539
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:16,756
He's dead.

540
00:42:18,687 --> 00:42:20,120
Oh, my God. No, he's not.

541
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,799
No, wait. Something's not right.

542
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:23,445
We've got to help him.

543
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:24,916
Amanda!

545
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,521
Hold on!

547
00:42:38,607 --> 00:42:39,881
They set a trap.

548
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:42,279
They actually set a trap.

550
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:49,520
What are you saying?

551
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:51,766
What are you looking for?

555
00:44:01,327 --> 00:44:02,203
Wait!

557
00:44:17,727 --> 00:44:18,682
Thanks.

558
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:20,960
Thanks a lot, Eric.

559
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:25,720
You know who I am?

560
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:26,683
Yeah.

561
00:44:27,327 --> 00:44:29,966
Your parents are here.
They're looking for you.

562
00:44:30,927 --> 00:44:31,962
Together?

563
00:44:32,487 --> 00:44:33,522
Together.

564
00:44:35,327 --> 00:44:36,646
That's not good.

565
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:38,798
They don't do so well together.

566
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:41,556
You'd be surprised what people can do...

567
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:43,280
...when they have to.

568
00:44:58,087 --> 00:44:59,486
You're Alan Grant.

569
00:45:00,887 --> 00:45:02,525
What are you doing here?

570
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:05,841
Your parents...

571
00:45:07,407 --> 00:45:08,886
...invited me along.

572
00:45:31,607 --> 00:45:33,279
I read both of your books.

573
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:36,439
I liked the first one more.

574
00:45:36,727 --> 00:45:38,638
Before you were on the island.

575
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:41,358
You liked dinosaurs back then.

576
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:44,435
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me yet.

577
00:45:47,847 --> 00:45:50,407
When Ingen cleared out,
they left a lot of stuff behind.

578
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:51,522
Any weapons?

579
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:54,360
No, and I just used the last
of the gas grenades.

580
00:45:54,727 --> 00:45:56,080
And I appreciate that.

582
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:01,917
Be careful with that. T-Rex.

583
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:04,005
It scares the smaller ones away...

584
00:46:04,087 --> 00:46:06,726
...but it attracts one really big one
with a fin.

585
00:46:07,327 --> 00:46:09,124
This is T-Rex pee?

586
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:13,880
How did you get it?

587
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:15,605
You don't want to know.

588
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:22,685
- Dessert?
- Sure.

589
00:46:27,527 --> 00:46:31,440
I have to tell you, I'm astonished
you've lasted eight weeks on this island.

590
00:46:33,527 --> 00:46:35,085
Is that all it's been?

591
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:38,841
You're alive and that's the important thing.

592
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:42,085
Thanks to you,
that's one thing we have in common.

593
00:46:44,687 --> 00:46:46,484
Did you read Malcolm's book?

594
00:46:47,607 --> 00:46:48,483
Yeah.

595
00:46:50,127 --> 00:46:50,923
So?

596
00:46:51,407 --> 00:46:53,045
I don't know. I mean...

597
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:55,205
It was kind of preachy.

598
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:58,122
And too much chaos. Everything is chaos.

599
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:00,836
Seemed like he was high on himself.

600
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:05,686
That's two things that we have in common.

602
00:47:11,887 --> 00:47:12,797
Listen.

603
00:47:13,687 --> 00:47:14,642
Compys!

604
00:47:26,527 --> 00:47:28,006
Alan!

605
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,836
Alan!

606
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,042
Alan!

607
00:47:55,327 --> 00:47:57,124
No matter how this turns out...

608
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,845
...it wasn't your fault.

609
00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:02,196
Eric's always been a strong-willed kid.

610
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:03,322
Always.

611
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:06,639
Then you throw someone
like Ben Hildebrand into the mix...

612
00:48:06,727 --> 00:48:07,762
...and...

613
00:48:08,687 --> 00:48:09,756
...well.

614
00:48:10,727 --> 00:48:11,842
Well, what?

615
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:15,076
All I'm saying is, it's not your fault.

616
00:48:19,407 --> 00:48:20,203
No.

617
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:23,206
If he'd been with you,
he'd be completely safe.

618
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:26,925
You drive five miles under the speed limit.

619
00:48:28,287 --> 00:48:30,801
And I've totalled three cars in three years.

620
00:48:31,647 --> 00:48:32,966
Well, not three.

621
00:48:33,047 --> 00:48:35,038
The Buick wasn't really totalled.

622
00:48:36,487 --> 00:48:39,445
I just said it was,
because I wanted to get the S.U.V.

623
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:46,476
I am so sorry that you have to be here.

624
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:50,596
I'm not.

625
00:50:04,607 --> 00:50:07,405
There's a boat, 
right alongside the bank.

626
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:09,757
- Looks in good shape.
- A rescue boat?

627
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:11,122
No, no.

628
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:13,959
Just something left behind.

629
00:50:14,327 --> 00:50:15,521
But it floats.

630
00:50:26,887 --> 00:50:28,400
We stick to the plan.

631
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:30,560
Head for the coast.

632
00:50:30,647 --> 00:50:32,399
You're not gonna look for Dr. Grant?

633
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,843
The coast was Alan's idea.
If he's alive, that's where he's headed.

634
00:50:35,927 --> 00:50:36,916
I agree.

635
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:38,326
What about Eric?

636
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:40,286
Eric's a smart kid.

637
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:42,801
He probably knows
his best chance is by the coast.

638
00:50:42,887 --> 00:50:45,799
He figures the big dinosaurs
are in the centre of the island.

639
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,036
Right?

640
00:50:48,687 --> 00:50:49,563
Sure.

641
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:57,759
You know what this is?

642
00:50:58,247 --> 00:51:00,283
It's a Raptor claw.
I used to have one.

643
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:02,162
A fossil.

644
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:04,676
Mine is new.

645
00:51:06,127 --> 00:51:08,436
How much of the island did you explore?

646
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:11,043
I stayed pretty close to the compound.

647
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:14,756
I figured if anyone came looking for me,
that's where they'd start.

648
00:51:15,127 --> 00:51:17,595
We need to get to the coast.
That was the plan.

649
00:51:17,687 --> 00:51:18,642
Are you sure?

650
00:51:18,727 --> 00:51:21,321
The closer you get to water,
the bigger things get.

651
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:23,875
If we can find our way
down into the canyon...

652
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:26,527
...we can follow 
that river out to the coast.

653
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:29,319
After we find your parents.

654
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:30,636
Then what?

655
00:51:31,247 --> 00:51:33,078
- One step at a time.
- Listen.

656
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:35,683
What?

658
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:39,006
That's my dad's satellite phone!

659
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:44,398
Wait a minute. How do you know?

660
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:47,400
"Kirby Paint and Tile Plus, in Westgate!"

661
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:49,566
Dad!

662
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,036
Mum!

663
00:51:51,727 --> 00:51:53,604
Mum! Dad!

665
00:52:11,887 --> 00:52:13,559
- Eric!
- Eric!

666
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:15,359
Eric! This way!

667
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,637
Mum! Dad!

668
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:21,683
Eric!

670
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,082
Mum, Dad! Mum, Dad!

671
00:52:35,807 --> 00:52:37,843
I knew it. My God.

672
00:52:38,727 --> 00:52:39,796
I knew it.

673
00:52:40,807 --> 00:52:41,796
Oh, God.

674
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,365
Boy, am I glad to see you.

675
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:47,206
Hey, you got my bag.

676
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:49,922
Yeah. Lucky strap.

677
00:52:51,727 --> 00:52:53,206
Want me to carry it?

678
00:52:54,607 --> 00:52:56,359
We need to find a gap here.

679
00:52:58,367 --> 00:53:00,483
- How did you know we were here?
- The phone.

680
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:02,762
That stupid jingle from the store.
I heard it.

681
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,724
- My phone?
- Your satellite phone.

682
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,479
- Where is it?
- I don't have it.

683
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:09,957
- When did you use it last?
- On the plane.

684
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,557
I got a call on the plane and...

685
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:16,440
- What?
- I loaned it to Nash.

686
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:18,880
He must have had it when he...

688
00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:30,277
Run.

693
00:54:32,327 --> 00:54:34,636
Alan, you want to give me the bag back?

694
00:54:35,087 --> 00:54:36,566
It's okay, I got it.

695
00:54:37,487 --> 00:54:39,125
Please, give me the bag.

696
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:44,121
It's not safe.

698
00:54:55,247 --> 00:54:56,396
Raptor eggs.

699
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:00,996
Did you steal Raptor eggs?

700
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,485
Now it all makes sense.

701
00:55:09,727 --> 00:55:13,037
I swear, if I'd known
you were going to end up with them...

702
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:17,566
It was an impulse,
I thought they'd be worth a fortune.

703
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,605
Enough to fund the dig site
another 10 more years.

704
00:55:20,687 --> 00:55:22,040
You have to believe me.

705
00:55:22,127 --> 00:55:25,597
This was a stupid decision,
but I did it with the best intentions.

706
00:55:25,687 --> 00:55:27,325
"With the best intentions."

707
00:55:29,407 --> 00:55:34,083
Some of the worst things imaginable
have been done with the best intentions.

708
00:55:35,407 --> 00:55:36,920
You know what, Billy?

709
00:55:37,127 --> 00:55:38,845
As far as I'm concerned...

710
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:42,164
...you're no better than the people
that built this place.

711
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:01,439
What are you doing?
Those things are after us because of those.

712
00:56:01,527 --> 00:56:04,917
Those things know we have the eggs.

713
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:09,206
If I drop them in the river,
they'll still be after us.

714
00:56:09,807 --> 00:56:13,595
- What if they catch us with them?
- What if they catch us without them?

715
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:19,636
There's a boat at the bottom,
just downriver.

716
00:56:19,727 --> 00:56:22,321
We can try and make it to the coast,
at least.

721
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:17,160
- You okay?
- Yeah.

723
00:57:28,247 --> 00:57:30,522
Let's do this one at a time, shall we?

726
00:58:07,327 --> 00:58:08,840
Okay, come on over!

727
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:11,080
One at a time!

728
00:58:11,447 --> 00:58:12,766
All right, Eric.

729
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:17,000
I'm going to leave you just for a minute.
And then you'll be right behind me, okay?

730
00:58:17,087 --> 00:58:17,917
Mum!

731
00:58:18,687 --> 00:58:21,121
I've been alone in a water truck
for eight weeks.

732
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:24,199
I think I can manage
the next two minutes without you.

733
00:58:27,287 --> 00:58:29,198
Right, we're all together now.

735
00:58:54,527 --> 00:58:55,642
Okay, Eric.

736
00:58:55,727 --> 00:58:57,319
- Okay.
- Come on, honey!

737
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,556
Over you go.

739
00:59:31,087 --> 00:59:32,281
Mum?

740
00:59:34,647 --> 00:59:35,841
Oh, my God.

741
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:39,438
- What is it?
- It's a birdcage.

742
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:41,436
For what?

745
00:59:47,727 --> 00:59:48,876
Dad!

746
00:59:48,967 --> 00:59:49,843
Eric!

747
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:51,363
Eric!

748
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:54,717
Eric!

749
01:00:06,447 --> 01:00:08,005
I can't see him!

750
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:13,157
Eric!

752
01:00:16,527 --> 01:00:17,482
No!

753
01:00:25,647 --> 01:00:26,443
This way!

754
01:00:38,887 --> 01:00:40,605
Billy? Billy!

755
01:00:43,767 --> 01:00:46,076
Billy, stop! 
Don't, Billy!

756
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:48,277
Billy!

757
01:01:04,967 --> 01:01:06,446
Eric, hold on!

758
01:01:11,487 --> 01:01:12,317
Eric!

759
01:01:25,287 --> 01:01:26,163
Jump!

760
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:52,997
Billy!

764
01:02:05,447 --> 01:02:06,562
Let go now!

767
01:02:50,847 --> 01:02:52,246
- Eric!
- He's there.

768
01:03:01,567 --> 01:03:02,443
Eric!

769
01:03:04,487 --> 01:03:07,001
There he is! He's across the river!

770
01:03:07,487 --> 01:03:08,966
Get him out of here!

771
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:12,959
- No!
- Go, Eric!

772
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:14,720
What about Billy?

773
01:03:29,127 --> 01:03:30,355
Hang on, Billy!

774
01:03:38,647 --> 01:03:39,477
Wait.

775
01:03:43,447 --> 01:03:44,482
Get away!

777
01:05:06,247 --> 01:05:07,999
There's plenty of gasoline.

778
01:05:08,207 --> 01:05:11,005
Now we've just got to make our way
to the coast.

779
01:05:11,447 --> 01:05:13,836
Work out some sort of a signal.

780
01:05:14,407 --> 01:05:17,843
Build a fire or something.
Something they can see from the air.

781
01:05:23,647 --> 01:05:24,716
Dr. Grant?

782
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:28,324
Hey, Eric, how are you doing?

783
01:05:37,887 --> 01:05:39,445
I'm sorry about Billy.

784
01:05:43,287 --> 01:05:45,926
You know what the last thing
I said to him was?

785
01:05:46,327 --> 01:05:47,282
I said:

786
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:50,845
"You're as bad as the people
that built this place."

787
01:05:51,167 --> 01:05:52,566
Which wasn't true.

788
01:05:52,887 --> 01:05:56,038
Billy was just young. That's all.

789
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,601
I have a theory
that there are two kinds of boys.

790
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:03,042
There are those
who want to be astronomers...

791
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:05,436
...and those who want to be astronauts.

792
01:06:06,007 --> 01:06:08,726
The astronomer, or the paleontologist...

793
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:14,155
...gets to study these amazing things
from a place of complete safety.

794
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:18,084
- But then you never get to go into space.
- Exactly.

795
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:21,520
It's the difference
between imagining and seeing.

796
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:23,916
To be able to touch them.

797
01:06:24,767 --> 01:06:27,918
And that's all Billy wanted.

798
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:36,636
Dr. Grant.

799
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:06,518
You know something, Dr. Grant?

800
01:07:08,247 --> 01:07:09,566
Billy was right.

802
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,437
Listen.

805
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:57,280
Find it before it stops!

806
01:07:57,367 --> 01:07:59,198
Eric, you stay on that boat.

808
01:08:02,047 --> 01:08:04,163
It's here. It's here.

809
01:08:05,727 --> 01:08:06,637
God.

810
01:08:13,527 --> 01:08:14,596
I got it.

811
01:08:22,527 --> 01:08:23,880
Hello? Hello?

812
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:26,117
You too can own a timeshare...

813
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:27,765
...in beautiful Guadalajara.

814
01:08:27,847 --> 01:08:30,202
Enjoy a meal in one
of our four-star restaurants.

815
01:08:30,287 --> 01:08:31,322
Look out!

819
01:08:50,567 --> 01:08:52,205
Turn off the power.

820
01:08:52,447 --> 01:08:54,278
You've got juice for maybe one call.

821
01:08:54,367 --> 01:08:56,517
Whatever you do,
don't call the U.S. Embassy.

822
01:08:56,607 --> 01:08:58,359
They won't do a damn thing.

823
01:08:58,607 --> 01:09:01,075
Hey, guys, come here! 
Look at this!

824
01:09:07,487 --> 01:09:10,445
- Bonitos.
- Something must have spooked them!

825
01:09:11,167 --> 01:09:13,158
Get the engine going, Mr. Kirby.

826
01:09:20,247 --> 01:09:21,646
Open the throttle!

828
01:09:28,047 --> 01:09:29,002
Pick up.

830
01:09:34,607 --> 01:09:35,517
Hello?

831
01:09:35,607 --> 01:09:36,596
Ellie?

832
01:09:37,247 --> 01:09:38,123
Hello?

833
01:09:38,527 --> 01:09:39,516
Charlie!

834
01:09:40,447 --> 01:09:42,005
- Charlie!
- Hello?

835
01:09:42,847 --> 01:09:45,680
Charlie, take the phone to Mummy now!

836
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:48,165
Take the phone to Mummy!

837
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:50,357
It's the dinosaur man!

838
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:53,237
- Okay.
- Listen to me, Charlie.

839
01:09:54,367 --> 01:09:55,356
Charlie!

840
01:09:56,407 --> 01:09:58,398
Are you taking the phone to Mum?

841
01:09:58,607 --> 01:09:59,596
Charlie!

844
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:28,597
Oh, ho-ho! Hi, everybody!

846
01:10:38,127 --> 01:10:39,719
It's great to be here!

847
01:10:39,807 --> 01:10:42,082
Hi, there! How are you?

848
01:10:51,287 --> 01:10:53,039
This is going to be great.

849
01:11:05,047 --> 01:11:07,402
- Who's on the phone?
- The dinosaur man.

850
01:11:07,487 --> 01:11:09,159
He is? Alan?

851
01:11:09,447 --> 01:11:11,881
Look in the boxes! Find a weapon!

853
01:11:19,847 --> 01:11:20,882
Where's the phone?

854
01:11:20,967 --> 01:11:22,525
- There!
- Get the phone!

855
01:11:31,927 --> 01:11:33,326
Ellie, listen to me!

856
01:11:33,647 --> 01:11:35,842
Are you on a cell phone?
I can't hear you.

857
01:11:35,927 --> 01:11:37,883
The river! Site B!

858
01:11:37,967 --> 01:11:38,843
The river!

859
01:11:41,687 --> 01:11:42,642
Hello?

863
01:12:42,767 --> 01:12:43,961
Hey!

865
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:46,720
Dad! Dad!

866
01:13:52,647 --> 01:13:53,682
Paul!

867
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:05,481
Dad!

868
01:14:09,647 --> 01:14:11,603
Paul, you jerk!

869
01:14:14,047 --> 01:14:15,924
You can't leave me like this!

870
01:14:18,447 --> 01:14:20,085
I'm not going anywhere!

872
01:14:35,887 --> 01:14:38,879
Remember when we went fishing
a couple of summers ago?

873
01:14:39,687 --> 01:14:42,838
I was putting the boat in the water
and the trailer sank?

874
01:14:43,767 --> 01:14:47,157
The tow truck tried to pull us out
and it got dragged in, too.

875
01:14:48,047 --> 01:14:50,686
The truck driver wanted
to knock my lights out.

876
01:14:56,087 --> 01:14:57,315
I miss fishing.

877
01:15:02,967 --> 01:15:04,036
Mr. Kirby?

878
01:15:08,887 --> 01:15:11,401
That lady you called. Who is she?

879
01:15:12,327 --> 01:15:14,318
How do you know that she can help us?

880
01:15:14,407 --> 01:15:17,604
She's the one person
I could always count on. I owe her a lot.

881
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:21,400
- I don't think I ever told her that.
- You should.

882
01:15:24,447 --> 01:15:25,641
You hear that?

883
01:15:27,287 --> 01:15:28,356
The ocean.

884
01:15:44,487 --> 01:15:45,920
They want the eggs.

885
01:15:47,007 --> 01:15:48,998
Otherwise, we'd be dead already.

886
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:57,124
Everybody get down.
She's challenging us.

887
01:16:15,767 --> 01:16:17,678
She thinks you stole the eggs.

888
01:16:17,887 --> 01:16:18,842
Get behind me.

890
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:41,160
Give me the eggs.

892
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:02,402
Do it, Mum.

894
01:17:20,367 --> 01:17:22,119
No. Call for help.

897
01:18:07,087 --> 01:18:08,566
That's a helicopter.

898
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:19,485
Dr. Grant?

899
01:18:19,567 --> 01:18:21,762
- Dr. Alan Grant?
- Stop!

900
01:18:22,367 --> 01:18:24,801
That's a very bad idea!

901
01:18:33,047 --> 01:18:34,878
- Second squad, move!
- Wow!

902
01:18:35,647 --> 01:18:39,117
You have to thank her now.
She sent the Navy and the Marines.

903
01:18:41,047 --> 01:18:42,719
God bless you, Ellie.

904
01:18:54,247 --> 01:18:56,681
- Dr. Grant, is this man with you?
- What?

905
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:07,556
You made it.

906
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:10,037
Yeah.

907
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:12,680
I rescued your hat.

908
01:19:13,647 --> 01:19:16,286
- Dr. Grant, we need to go now!
- Oh, yeah.

909
01:19:19,007 --> 01:19:21,077
Well, that's the important thing.

910
01:19:21,487 --> 01:19:22,556
Dr. Grant!

911
01:19:25,007 --> 01:19:27,567
Can I get you to sit here
and buckle up, sir?

912
01:19:34,207 --> 01:19:37,597
Sea Shadow to Dust Storm, 
six souls on board.

913
01:19:39,287 --> 01:19:41,278
Dust Storm to Sea Shadow, roger.

914
01:19:45,767 --> 01:19:47,325
What the hell is that?

915
01:19:48,567 --> 01:19:50,080
Dr. Grant, look!

916
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:01,637
Where do you think they're going?

917
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,244
I don't know. Maybe just looking
for new nesting grounds.

918
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,278
It's a whole new world for them.

919
01:20:07,367 --> 01:20:09,642
I dare them to nest in Enid, Oklahoma.

920
01:20:16,087 --> 01:20:17,281
Let's go home.
