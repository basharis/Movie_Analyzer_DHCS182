1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,403
After the conquest and plundering
of the Inca empire by Spain...

2
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:08,962
...the Indians invented the
legend of El Dorado...

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:13,478
...a land of gold, located in the
swamps of the Amazon headwaters.

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:20,084
A large expedition of Spanish
adventurers, led by Gonzalo Pizarro...

5
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:24,088
...set off from the Peruvian
highlands in late 1560.

6
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:29,950
The only document to survive
from this lost expedition...

7
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:33,122
...is the diary of the monk
Gaspar de Carvajal.

8
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:15,346
<i>On Christmas day 1560, we reached
the last pass of the Andes...</i>

9
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,511
<i>...and for the first time looked
down at the legendary jungle.</i>

10
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:25,844
<i>In the morning I read mass, then we
descended through the clouds.</i>

11
00:03:34,553 --> 00:03:39,951
AGUIRRE,
THE WRATH OF GOD

12
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,545
A film by
Werner Herzog

13
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:39,622
No one can get down that river alive!

14
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,352
I tell you, we can do it!

15
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:51,193
From here it will be easier.

16
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,883
No. We're all going to go under.

17
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,237
<i>Our Indian slaves are useless.</i>

18
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:31,440
<i>The changing climate
kills them off like flies...</i>

19
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:34,134
<i>...most of them die of colds.</i>

20
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:37,934
<i>We don't even have time to
give them a Christian burial.</i>

21
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:09,394
Come on, move it!

22
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:17,093
Move you pigs!
Come on! Let's go!

23
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:21,128
Keep moving, we don't want
to get stuck in the mud!

24
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:26,764
Son of a bitch!

25
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,993
You idiots!
The sedan-chair will get stuck!

26
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,485
This way!

27
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:48,685
Damned mud!

28
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,653
Watch it, you idiots!

29
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,045
Keep the barrel out of the water!

30
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:52,070
<i>By the last day of the year,
we were exhausted.</i>

31
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,079
<i>We camped near the river.</i>

32
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:03,237
It can't go on like this, men.

33
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:07,544
The rations are almost finished.

34
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:14,074
The terrain is so difficult,
we're almost at a standstill.

35
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:22,431
We cannot hope to reach a
populated area for some time.

36
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:28,835
In view of the situation we're in...

37
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:32,733
...I have changed my plans...

38
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:34,898
...as follows:

39
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:41,502
Rafts will be built
and manned by forty men.

40
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:47,070
These men will have the task...

41
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:53,402
...to get food and information
about hostile Indians...

42
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:56,470
...and the location of El Dorado.

43
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:03,532
We have every reason to
believe that both are near...

44
00:11:04,903 --> 00:11:08,425
The expedition must return
within one week...

45
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,799
...by water or by land.

46
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:15,497
If it doesn't...

47
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:19,590
...we have to assume it is lost...

48
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:24,653
...and we have to march back
the same way...

49
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:30,196
...in the hope of reaching an area
inhabited by Christians.

50
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:35,452
We hope, of course,
that this will not happen...

51
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:38,994
...as long as the Virgin Mary
is with us.

52
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:44,321
After careful consideration,
I have decided...

53
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:50,620
...to make Don Pedro de Ursua
commander of the expedition.

54
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:56,356
His mistress, Dona Inez de Atienza,
will accompany him.

55
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,623
This happens against my
better judgement.

56
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:05,749
But she expressed her wish with
such grace and firmness...

57
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,547
...that I cannot refuse it.

58
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:12,953
Don Lope de Aguirre will be
second in command.

59
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:16,818
A man who is well qualified
for this task.

60
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:20,442
His daughter Flores will stay
under his protection...

61
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:24,009
...this also is against
my better judgement.

62
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:30,017
At fifteen, she should have stayed
in the care of the Holy Sisters.

63
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:36,147
As on all expeditions, the word of
God must be brought to the pagans.

64
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:41,681
I hereby nominate Brother
Gaspar de Carvajal for this task.

65
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:48,943
The remaining two hundred slaves
will stay with my group.

66
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:55,879
The Royal House of Spain
will be represented...

67
00:12:56,014 --> 00:12:59,276
...by the brave nobleman,
Don Fernando de Guzman...

68
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,676
...who proved his courage
10 years ago...

69
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,939
...at the storming of the fortress
of Saxahuaman.

70
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:10,609
Some of the best warriors will
form this group...

71
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:15,734
...but those not chosen
shouldn't feel rejected.

72
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:19,772
I declare all this in the
form of a document...

73
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:24,668
...to be submitted for approval
to the Council of the Indies.

74
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,806
Herewith I append my signature.

75
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,637
<i>Four days later, on January fourth,
we set out.</i>

76
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:47,700
<i>May God be with us.</i>

77
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:03,335
Watch the raft,
the rapids get stronger!

78
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:11,573
Keep in the middle of the river!

79
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:54,633
- The first raft got stuck in an eddy!
- They must get away from the rocks!

80
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:39,954
<i>January Sixth.</i>

81
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:43,591
<i>We finally reached shore
and set up camp.</i>

82
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,917
<i>On the other side of the river,
one of our rafts ran into an eddy.</i>

83
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:55,452
<i>We could not hear what they
were yelling, and could not help.</i>

84
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,821
How many are on the raft?

85
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:03,890
Seven and two Indians.

86
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:07,251
We must try to help
the poor devils, Aguirre.

87
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,385
You are crazy!

88
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:13,688
We will not help them!

89
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,983
I'm still giving the orders.

90
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:24,276
Is that so...

91
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:38,342
We need long ropes and hooks.
Further downstream we can cross.

92
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:45,172
Once we're on the other side,
we'll be able to get them out.

93
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:51,074
Take as many men as
you need... and hurry!

94
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:36,994
I wonder if Armando has
reached the other side?

95
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:42,025
Those men must be getting sick.
They're still going around in circles.

96
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:50,886
- What is this?
- They're firing over there.

97
00:20:52,593 --> 00:20:55,057
They're trying to signal us.

98
00:20:55,858 --> 00:20:57,756
Maybe it's a battle?

99
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,550
There are only six.

100
00:21:33,684 --> 00:21:36,877
The oarsmen and the
seventh man have gone.

101
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,675
I find that strange.

102
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:43,910
Look, the oars are still there.

103
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:52,246
I'm sure, there are still
some Indians in this area.

104
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:58,773
We better go back to the camp.

105
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,237
Keep your eyes open!

106
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:00,594
Help!

107
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:02,757
Indians! Indians!

108
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:10,023
A prayer from here is not enough,
Brother Carvajal.

109
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,429
I want to take these men
back for a Christian burial.

110
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:15,728
You are right, my son...

111
00:23:16,665 --> 00:23:19,654
...their souls will rest much better
in consecrated ground.

112
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:24,253
It's the least we can do for these
poor guys who died so bravely.

113
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:40,823
Perucho!

114
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:58,717
Perucho, don't you think the
cannon is getting a bit rusty?

115
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:00,550
Perhaps.

116
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:08,639
You know very well
who is responsible.

117
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:13,602
If Aguirre gets away with this,
who knows what he'll do next?

118
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,198
Don't worry about that.

119
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,067
We really have other problems.

120
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:20,930
There are Indians everywhere.

121
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:24,040
The whole area is full of them...

122
00:25:24,142 --> 00:25:27,868
...and no one wants to die
like the men on the raft.

123
00:25:27,974 --> 00:25:30,872
If only we were out of this trouble...

124
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,703
We can't hope for that yet.

125
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:37,067
Don't be afraid.

126
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:42,426
Aguirre would never dare to rebel
against the Spanish crown.

127
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:45,033
We are not in Castile, here.

128
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:52,394
Look what I've found for you.

129
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:56,500
This animal sleeps its
whole life away.

130
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:02,294
It's never really awake.

131
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:28,954
Our rafts are gone.

132
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:35,258
The rafts are gone!

133
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,154
<i>January Eighth.</i>

134
00:26:39,794 --> 00:26:42,657
<i>The river rose fifteen feet
over night.</i>

135
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:46,684
<i>When will our misfortunes end?</i>

136
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:32,280
If I remove your chains,
will you run away?

137
00:27:33,817 --> 00:27:35,112
Would you?

138
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:40,239
Stop, wait a minute, isn't that my pot?

139
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:43,273
What are you doing with my pot?

140
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:50,279
No, the wood is too heavy.

141
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:56,305
We'll take this one. I'm not taking
one step further into this jungle.

142
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:04,240
What's going on?

143
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:07,733
We're making nails.

144
00:28:08,877 --> 00:28:10,309
What for?

145
00:28:10,478 --> 00:28:13,169
We need as many nails as possible.

146
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:18,765
What are you doing with this log?

147
00:28:18,874 --> 00:28:23,431
Well, I'm carrying it from where
I found it back to the camp.

148
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,268
Who gave that order?

149
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,899
Everyone here is collecting wood.

150
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,771
And iron.

151
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:53,031
What's going on here?

152
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:55,757
I have no idea.

153
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:58,856
Who gave the order to build rafts?

154
00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:23,393
What does it all mean?
Do you know, Inez?

155
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,126
Don't even ask.
It's your father's fault.

156
00:29:28,796 --> 00:29:31,386
If only it were all over.

157
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:38,890
Gentlemen, as your commander,
I have decided...

158
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:41,217
...to return to our main troop.

159
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:42,952
It's not my habit to retreat.

160
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,956
We have to march back, of course,
because the current is too strong.

161
00:29:48,091 --> 00:29:52,785
We need to get back within the
time Pizarro ordered.

162
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,686
But that would be suicide
because of the Indians.

163
00:29:56,957 --> 00:30:00,582
Whatever the cost,
we have to march back.

164
00:30:01,222 --> 00:30:03,211
We must get back to Pizarro!

165
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:05,183
Shit on Pizarro!

166
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:09,118
I say, we can't accomplish
our task this way.

167
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:12,880
And I say, we can conquer
without Pizarro!

168
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,614
That's what we gathered
logs and iron for...

169
00:30:16,885 --> 00:30:18,909
...to build a raft.

170
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:25,506
Do you remember Hernando Cortez?

171
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:30,938
Bound for Mexico, he was ordered
to return...

172
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:33,010
...but he just went on!

173
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,378
Silence, Aguirre!

174
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:45,648
He ignored the orders
and conquered Mexico!

175
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:47,303
Silence, everyone!

176
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,978
That's how he became
rich and famous...

177
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,204
Be quiet!

178
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,068
Because he disobeyed!

179
00:30:54,913 --> 00:30:56,537
Put him in chains!

180
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:09,441
Stop it, now!

181
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:15,840
- I follow Ursua.
- Kill him!

182
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,728
Anyone else?

183
00:31:51,335 --> 00:31:54,301
What do you think will happen now?

184
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:02,323
What if there are
waterfalls downstream?

185
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:06,694
Who cares, as long as we
get closer to El Dorado.

186
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:15,960
Have you seen Ursua
clenching his fist?

187
00:32:16,063 --> 00:32:18,393
He must have something in it.

188
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:25,018
I think, they will kill him.

189
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:28,525
Would you have the courage
to help him?

190
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:19,272
You're the only one who can help us.

191
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:23,629
I know he will kill Ursua
and Armando.

192
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:28,803
He will finish what he has started.

193
00:34:29,973 --> 00:34:32,268
You are my last hope.

194
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:41,262
Thou lettest man flow on like a river...

195
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,961
...and Thy years know no end.

196
00:34:44,736 --> 00:34:47,099
As for man...

197
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:50,228
...his days are like grass...

198
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:54,198
...as a flower on the field,
so he blossoms.

199
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,232
For when the wind passeth over it...

200
00:34:57,334 --> 00:35:01,856
...and it is gone, and the place
thereof shall know it no more.

201
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:06,091
You know, my child...

202
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:10,763
...for the good of our Lord...

203
00:35:11,264 --> 00:35:14,889
...the Church was always
on the side of the strong.

204
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:35,615
I would like to have you on our side.

205
00:35:43,093 --> 00:35:45,115
We need men like you.

206
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:58,213
You should think about it...

207
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:02,353
...but not too long.

208
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:11,983
Well, gentlemen...

209
00:36:12,885 --> 00:36:15,477
...we've gotten rid of
the troublemakers.

210
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:17,483
Now we need a leader.

211
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:20,642
For me, the choice is clear.

212
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:25,681
We should elect the biggest
and strongest nobleman we have.

213
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,806
- What me?
- Yes... you.

214
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,275
Well, gentlemen.

215
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:40,140
I am making a proposal
to elect Guzmán.

216
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:42,439
Who else is for him?

217
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,095
I propose that Don Lope de Aguirre
remains second-in-command!

218
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:25,728
Who's in favor?

219
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:47,699
Plagues have come over my
people, earthquakes and floods...

220
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:49,858
...but what the Spaniards did to us...

221
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:52,296
...is much, much worse.

222
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,196
They gave me the name Balthasar,
but my real name is Runo Rimac.

223
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,197
- What does that mean?
- Runo Rimac.

224
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:03,958
It means: He who speaks.
I was a prince in this land.

225
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:08,361
No one was allowed to look
directly into my eyes.

226
00:38:08,465 --> 00:38:11,259
But now I'm in chains,
like my people...

227
00:38:11,397 --> 00:38:13,919
...and I must bow my head.

228
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:20,161
Almost everything was taken from us.
I can't do anything, I'm powerless.

229
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:22,951
But I am also sorry for you...

230
00:38:23,062 --> 00:38:28,119
...because I know there is
no escape from this jungle.

231
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:15,147
How is Ursua?

232
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:43,377
Because of our mutiny,
we must make our position legal.

233
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:45,909
Read this document.

234
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:55,404
Caesarian King, by the grace of God,
through our Holy Mother...

235
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:59,238
...the Roman Church,
Philip the Second of Castile.

236
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:02,535
We, the undersigned,
have until yesterday...

237
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:06,664
...the seventh day of 1561

238
00:40:06,776 --> 00:40:09,708
...regarded ourselves as your
servants and subjects.

239
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:14,899
We are now more than 200 miles
from your servant, Gonzalo Pizarro.

240
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:19,404
Fate, God's help and the work of our
hands have carried us down a river.

241
00:40:19,506 --> 00:40:23,336
A river, the natives call Huallaga,
in search of a new land of gold.

242
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:27,336
We have decided to put
an end to the quirks of fate.

243
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:32,529
We are forging history, and no fruits of
this earth shall henceforth be shared.

244
00:40:32,637 --> 00:40:34,966
We rebel until death.

245
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:44,165
Our hands shall perish and our
tongues dry up if this is not so.

246
00:40:44,302 --> 00:40:47,132
The House of Habsburg
is overthrown.

247
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:51,188
And you, Philip the Second,
are dethroned.

248
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,926
By dint of this declaration,
be you annihilated.

249
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:57,159
In your place we proclaim...

250
00:40:57,334 --> 00:41:01,162
...the nobleman from Sevilla,
Don Fernando de Guzmán...

251
00:41:01,265 --> 00:41:03,561
...as Emperor of El Dorado.

252
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:05,823
Flee from hence, O King!

253
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,892
And may God bless your soul.

254
00:41:08,997 --> 00:41:13,292
Fortune smiles on the brave
and spits on the coward.

255
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:17,590
Let's sever our ties with Spain and
crown Don Fernando de Guzmán...

256
00:41:17,696 --> 00:41:19,787
...Emperor of El Dorado.

257
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:22,087
Do you call this a throne?

258
00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:27,455
What is a throne, but a plank
covered with velvet, Your Majesty.

259
00:43:08,741 --> 00:43:11,605
He must have
dragged himself along.

260
00:43:11,707 --> 00:43:15,571
That's no arrow wound,
that was a sword thrust.

261
00:43:23,972 --> 00:43:26,993
He must have tried to stop him.

262
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,630
<i>January Tenth.</i>

263
00:43:30,037 --> 00:43:33,026
<i>Armando escaped from his prison.</i>

264
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:37,566
<i>The man who went on guard at
three o'clock was murdered.</i>

265
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:02,762
It was one of his men.
While Ursua is alive...

266
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,360
...you'll never be safe!

267
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,518
What can I do about it?

268
00:44:07,663 --> 00:44:09,152
Kill him.

269
00:44:09,464 --> 00:44:13,452
While I'm Emperor, law will prevail.

270
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:16,384
No killings without a trial.

271
00:44:16,495 --> 00:44:19,825
Then try him... and then kill him!

272
00:44:19,995 --> 00:44:22,654
But it must me a public trial.

273
00:44:24,593 --> 00:44:26,719
He still has sympathizers.

274
00:44:29,026 --> 00:44:32,322
Perucho, to the witness stand.

275
00:44:42,191 --> 00:44:44,553
What did you get out of Ursua?

276
00:44:44,656 --> 00:44:45,713
Nothing.

277
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,920
Three men couldn't open his fist.
He must have something in it.

278
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:52,453
We'd have to chop his
hand off to get at it.

279
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:55,951
He said nothing,
except some nonsense.

280
00:44:57,088 --> 00:44:59,384
But last night he had visitors.

281
00:45:00,853 --> 00:45:04,444
The whole story reeks of conspiracy.

282
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:11,212
Balthasar, ask him if it's true that
he received money from Ursua.

283
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,839
Yes, it's true.

284
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,839
It was the oarsmen's pay.

285
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,109
Next witness!

286
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:30,538
Okello, is it true that you also
received money from Ursua?

287
00:45:31,215 --> 00:45:36,510
I was Pizarro's slave. Then he
gave me away for this expedition...

288
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:41,378
...because he thought, if the Indians
are scared of a horse...

289
00:45:41,479 --> 00:45:44,377
...they'd be terrified of a black man.

290
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:51,010
Well, I don't know why, but
sometimes Ursua gave me money.

291
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:57,100
What does the defendant
have to say?

292
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,470
I want to speak.

293
00:46:18,738 --> 00:46:22,932
In Spain I had many servants,
and I paid them.

294
00:46:24,105 --> 00:46:28,798
It is only fair to give them
money here as well...

295
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,495
...even if they are Indians.

296
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:36,429
Time will tell that Ursua is right.

297
00:46:36,536 --> 00:46:40,900
We understand your confusion,
my child. You are excused.

298
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:04,023
The jury, after having heard
all testimonies...

299
00:47:05,164 --> 00:47:07,459
...finds the defendant...

300
00:47:07,663 --> 00:47:09,753
...guilty of treason.

301
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,457
My unpleasant duty...

302
00:47:14,828 --> 00:47:19,453
...as President of the first court
of your Highness, Don Fernando...

303
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:24,952
...is to sentence Pedro de Ursua...

304
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:28,253
...to death by hanging.

305
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:33,656
I confirm the verdict.

306
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:38,156
But since it is the anniversary of
the last Moor leaving Spain...

307
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:41,022
...I will grant clemency.

308
00:47:41,457 --> 00:47:44,581
His life will be spared,
but he forfeits...

309
00:47:44,722 --> 00:47:48,018
...all rights as a citizen of El Dorado.

310
00:47:48,122 --> 00:47:51,053
Half of his shares
will go to the Church...

311
00:47:51,155 --> 00:47:55,519
...the other half will be divided
among my best soldiers.

312
00:48:23,915 --> 00:48:25,575
<i>January Twelfth.</i>

313
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:29,176
<i>In the morning we set out
with a new raft.</i>

314
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:31,769
<i>Ursua is still alive...</i>

315
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,442
<i>...but he refuses to speak.</i>

316
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,270
Look, a fire!

317
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,974
<i>At noon we saw a great fire.</i>

318
00:48:41,845 --> 00:48:43,970
Steer closer to the shore!

319
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:48,104
Load your muskets.

320
00:48:48,444 --> 00:48:50,467
I can't see anyone.

321
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,572
Be careful, men!
It could be an ambush.

322
00:48:56,043 --> 00:48:58,235
Strip the negro, go on!

323
00:49:07,474 --> 00:49:13,336
<i>Fearing an ambush, we stripped the
negro slave, to frighten the Indians.</i>

324
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:31,861
Go! Run!

325
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,897
Go on! Go, I said!

326
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:39,596
Drive him in front of us!

327
00:49:57,864 --> 00:49:59,922
Get away from the food!

328
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,322
Look out for Indians!

329
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,626
Are you crazy?

330
00:50:07,729 --> 00:50:09,592
Take your weapons!

331
00:50:46,856 --> 00:50:49,947
Look at that. It was one of our men.

332
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,516
Where does this come from?

333
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:05,309
And this here?

334
00:51:07,285 --> 00:51:09,546
For heaven's sake, cannibals!

335
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:27,275
<i>The discovery of cannibals
around us was so disturbing...</i>

336
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:30,074
<i>...that we hastily left
this dreadful place.</i>

337
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,338
<i>January twentieth.</i>

338
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:54,240
<i>The mountains are now behind us
and the land is flat.</i>

339
00:51:54,677 --> 00:51:59,438
<i>The roof Aguirre had us build,
protects us against the scorching sun.</i>

340
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:05,231
<i>The river is sluggish and we're
slowly coming to a halt.</i>

341
00:52:29,069 --> 00:52:32,331
What's this?
Are you giving him a gun?

342
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:22,720
Aguirre, I know that you plan on
doing something to Ursua!

343
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,015
There's no doubt in my mind.

344
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:30,651
And God will punish you for that!

345
00:53:38,322 --> 00:53:40,686
Get out of my way!

346
00:53:53,754 --> 00:53:55,878
Are you alright, little one?

347
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:29,104
What's happening?
You can't hear a thing.

348
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:23,395
It's suddenly so quiet.

349
00:55:26,235 --> 00:55:28,293
Yes, not a sound.

350
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:31,792
Shh... so, we can hear...

351
00:55:49,265 --> 00:55:51,254
The gunpowder! It's on fire!

352
00:55:51,365 --> 00:55:54,660
Out of the way! It's going to blow up!

353
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:04,720
Grab the pole!

354
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,692
Help me pull the Emperor
onto the raft!

355
00:56:08,328 --> 00:56:11,089
Here, so he can hold on to it.

356
00:56:14,927 --> 00:56:16,825
Damned horse...

357
00:56:17,593 --> 00:56:19,718
...nothing but trouble!

358
00:56:23,426 --> 00:56:25,187
What's wrong with him?

359
00:56:32,124 --> 00:56:33,419
He's dead.

360
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,548
Look how short the arrow is.

361
00:56:36,656 --> 00:56:37,815
Poisoned.

362
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:40,846
It must belong to a dwarf.

363
00:56:43,655 --> 00:56:47,382
- Fire! Make some noise, quickly!
- What are we to aim at?

364
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,078
Just shoot, you asshole!

365
00:56:50,654 --> 00:56:51,778
Fire!

366
00:56:52,353 --> 00:56:53,683
Fire!

367
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:48,241
Come, play something for the men.

368
00:59:02,961 --> 00:59:05,621
- Look, isn't that a canoe?
- Where?

369
00:59:05,728 --> 00:59:09,125
Over there under those trees,
it's coming towards us.

370
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:26,245
Keep the raft mid-stream.
It could be a trap.

371
00:59:34,888 --> 00:59:36,752
<i>January twenty fourth.</i>

372
00:59:37,455 --> 00:59:40,750
<i>For the first time, we saw
two of the savages.</i>

373
00:59:41,321 --> 00:59:43,718
<i>They seemed to be trusting.</i>

374
00:59:46,221 --> 00:59:47,811
Pull the boat close.

375
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:50,109
I have the man. Hold him!

376
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,549
And I have the woman.

377
00:59:53,152 --> 00:59:55,085
Look, there's a fish!

378
01:00:30,245 --> 01:00:31,836
What did he say?

379
01:00:33,845 --> 01:00:35,175
He says...

380
01:00:36,311 --> 01:00:38,038
...he's from the Yagua Tribe.

381
01:00:39,443 --> 01:00:45,500
He knows from his ancestors
that one day, the Sons of the Sun...

382
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:49,139
...would arrive from afar,
through great perils.

383
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:53,673
The strangers would come with
thunder from tubes.

384
01:00:53,808 --> 01:00:57,569
They've waited a long time for the
coming of the Sons of the Sun.

385
01:00:57,674 --> 01:01:01,695
For here on this river,
God never finished His Creation.

386
01:01:01,872 --> 01:01:05,430
Look, gold!
Where did you get that?

387
01:01:15,336 --> 01:01:16,734
Gold!

388
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:21,326
Gold! Ask him where he got it from.

389
01:01:21,737 --> 01:01:23,928
Ask him where El Dorado is.

390
01:01:24,135 --> 01:01:26,397
Where does this gold come from?

391
01:01:32,266 --> 01:01:33,731
What did he say?

392
01:01:36,966 --> 01:01:41,091
Has this savage ever heard
of our savior Jesus Christ...

393
01:01:41,399 --> 01:01:44,853
...and of our mission and
the True Word of God?

394
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:54,027
This is a Bible.
It contains the Word of God...

395
01:01:54,895 --> 01:01:59,328
...that we preach to bring light
into the darkness of their world.

396
01:02:01,527 --> 01:02:06,152
Does he understand at all, that this
book contains the Word of God?

397
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:11,122
Take it in your hand, my son.

398
01:02:16,626 --> 01:02:20,250
- He says, it doesn't talk.
- Kill him for this blasphemy!

399
01:02:28,756 --> 01:02:30,915
<i>It is a tough business.</i>

400
01:02:31,056 --> 01:02:33,646
<i>These savages are hard to convert.</i>

401
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:52,651
It won't be much longer.

402
01:02:53,552 --> 01:02:58,007
El Dorado might be only
a few days away.

403
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:03,248
No more rust on the cannon.

404
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:06,844
We will shoot our enemies
with golden bullets.

405
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:12,339
And you, Okello, will serve
my food on golden platters.

406
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:15,711
And all of us will gain something.

407
01:03:17,214 --> 01:03:19,043
Governships...

408
01:03:19,147 --> 01:03:20,805
...provinces...

409
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,138
...and women.

410
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:26,910
And perhaps I'll even be free.

411
01:03:30,678 --> 01:03:34,440
Let's not forget the most
important part of our mission...

412
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:37,437
...to spread the Word of God
to the savages.

413
01:03:37,544 --> 01:03:43,566
I'm sure you'd like a golden cross
studded with jewels, Carvajal...

414
01:03:43,675 --> 01:03:46,800
...instead of the silver one you lost.

415
01:04:31,866 --> 01:04:36,821
All the land to our left
and all the land to our right...

416
01:04:36,932 --> 01:04:39,160
...now belongs to us.

417
01:04:43,164 --> 01:04:49,153
I solemnly and formally
take possession of all this land.

418
01:05:11,259 --> 01:05:17,451
Our country is already six
times larger than Spain...

419
01:05:18,091 --> 01:05:22,580
...and every day we drift,
makes it bigger.

420
01:05:23,957 --> 01:05:28,513
Have you seen any solid ground
that would support your weight?

421
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:59,067
Okello, it's missing salt!

422
01:06:59,739 --> 01:07:02,898
Fish and fruit we can
find now and then...

423
01:07:03,238 --> 01:07:06,294
...but we've been out of salt
for a while.

424
01:07:08,104 --> 01:07:12,968
We're down to counting our
last grains of corn.

425
01:07:53,063 --> 01:07:55,960
- Hold the horse!
- The horse has cut loose!

426
01:07:56,062 --> 01:07:58,551
- Take the reins!
- Watch out!

427
01:07:58,728 --> 01:08:01,159
Watch, that it doesn't jump off board!

428
01:08:37,987 --> 01:08:41,679
Damn, get that horse away from me!
Get rid of it!

429
01:08:44,852 --> 01:08:47,215
Throw that damned beast off the raft!

430
01:08:47,352 --> 01:08:51,147
Go on!
Go for a swim!

431
01:08:55,184 --> 01:08:57,775
- It wants to get back on board.
- Go away!

432
01:10:03,405 --> 01:10:05,667
I think he's a dead man.

433
01:10:06,671 --> 01:10:12,762
In Mexico, I saw an army of Indians
flee at the sight of one single horse.

434
01:10:13,336 --> 01:10:17,790
And besides, we could have
eaten meat for a week...

435
01:10:42,598 --> 01:10:46,790
Don't worry, little one,
the horse will be alright.

436
01:10:57,827 --> 01:10:59,816
Oh, my God, the Emperor!

437
01:11:00,562 --> 01:11:02,423
The Emperor is dead!

438
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:36,845
<i>After our Emperor's death,
the fate of Ursua was sealed.</i>

439
01:11:37,054 --> 01:11:42,679
<i>Next morning, a few soldiers took
him away and he never came back.</i>

440
01:13:45,497 --> 01:13:48,791
Little mother,

441
01:13:49,095 --> 01:13:51,084
...two by two...

442
01:13:52,262 --> 01:13:54,818
...wafts the wind on my hair.

443
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:50,973
What are they shouting?

444
01:14:51,084 --> 01:14:55,039
They're shouting,
"Meat is floating by."

445
01:15:33,109 --> 01:15:34,132
Fire!

446
01:15:34,877 --> 01:15:36,932
Set the village on fire!

447
01:15:40,409 --> 01:15:42,271
Keep shooting, it'll scare them!

448
01:15:48,141 --> 01:15:50,072
Don't go into the jungle!

449
01:15:56,305 --> 01:15:57,602
Salt!

450
01:16:01,504 --> 01:16:02,765
Salt!

451
01:16:09,735 --> 01:16:12,361
I haven't had salt for a month!

452
01:17:17,523 --> 01:17:21,922
She has gone without a trace.
We couldn't find her anywhere.

453
01:17:22,189 --> 01:17:24,745
We have not seen any Indians either.

454
01:17:25,988 --> 01:17:28,215
Let's march back to Pizarro.

455
01:17:28,621 --> 01:17:31,711
Two men, more or less,
it won't matter to him.

456
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:36,047
I am sick of it. I'm leaving tonight.

457
01:17:36,153 --> 01:17:39,084
If I march at night,
the Indians won't catch me.

458
01:17:39,184 --> 01:17:42,514
In the day, I will hide.
I will get back to Pizarro.

459
01:17:42,651 --> 01:17:47,207
We followed her tracks half a mile
into the jungle, then we lost them.

460
01:17:47,316 --> 01:17:49,407
She simply vanished!

461
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:55,542
Then one of the men panicked
because of the silence...

462
01:17:55,648 --> 01:17:59,046
...which always comes just before
someone gets killed.

463
01:17:59,515 --> 01:18:04,674
I'd rather join the Indians,
than stay with this madman.

464
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:07,713
That man is a head taller than me.

465
01:18:08,681 --> 01:18:10,577
That may change...

466
01:18:18,678 --> 01:18:22,269
I'll explain my plan.
I have counted the river bends.

467
01:18:22,511 --> 01:18:26,169
I've drawn a map in the sand.

468
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:29,504
We need about a day for each bend.

469
01:18:30,176 --> 01:18:32,607
One, two...

470
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:35,764
...three, four, five...

471
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:37,870
...six, seven...

472
01:18:38,141 --> 01:18:39,471
...eight...

473
01:18:39,608 --> 01:18:40,595
...nine...

474
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,969
...ten.

475
01:18:46,273 --> 01:18:51,226
I am the great traitor.
There can be no greater!

476
01:18:53,471 --> 01:18:58,562
Whoever even thinks about deserting
will be cut into 198 pieces!

477
01:18:59,803 --> 01:19:05,030
And then trampled upon until
you can paint the walls with him.

478
01:19:11,435 --> 01:19:14,298
Whoever eats one grain too many...

479
01:19:14,401 --> 01:19:16,765
...or drinks one drop of water
too much...

480
01:19:18,267 --> 01:19:22,198
...will be locked up for 155 years!

481
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:32,552
If I, Aguirre, want the birds
to drop dead from the trees...

482
01:19:32,664 --> 01:19:36,255
...the birds will drop dead
from the trees.

483
01:19:40,295 --> 01:19:42,625
I am the Wrath of God!

484
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:47,392
The earth I walk upon
sees me and quakes!

485
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:57,952
But whoever follows me
and the river, will win untold riches.

486
01:20:07,324 --> 01:20:09,551
But whoever deserts...

487
01:22:13,501 --> 01:22:16,591
Get away from the tree!
Go to mid-stream!

488
01:22:16,699 --> 01:22:19,631
- Hey, give me a pole!
- Watch out, the roof!

489
01:22:19,733 --> 01:22:22,563
Watch out, the sedan-chair is falling!

490
01:22:26,331 --> 01:22:28,229
Careful!

491
01:22:28,998 --> 01:22:30,361
Over there.

492
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:35,022
The long arrows are
getting fashionable...

493
01:22:36,996 --> 01:22:39,791
- Indians!
- Where? I don't see any.

494
01:22:40,161 --> 01:22:43,786
- Make noise!
- I better get out of here.

495
01:23:08,156 --> 01:23:09,645
<i>February first.</i>

496
01:23:10,257 --> 01:23:14,745
<i>The men's morale is at a low point.
I spoke with Aguirre.</i>

497
01:23:15,155 --> 01:23:18,054
Things are not turning out
as we expected.

498
01:23:18,422 --> 01:23:22,081
We see nothing but
hunger and death.

499
01:23:22,454 --> 01:23:25,442
We lose men,
but we never see the enemy.

500
01:23:25,986 --> 01:23:29,884
Even El Dorado hasn't been
more than an illusion.

501
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:45,514
Mexico was no illusion!

502
01:23:53,814 --> 01:23:58,337
If we turn back now,
others will come.

503
01:23:58,814 --> 01:24:00,746
And they will succeed!

504
01:24:02,979 --> 01:24:05,502
And we'll remain a failure!

505
01:24:06,413 --> 01:24:09,969
Even if this land only consists
of trees and water...

506
01:24:10,312 --> 01:24:12,278
...we will conquer it!

507
01:24:12,978 --> 01:24:18,932
And it'll be milked dry
by those who follow us.

508
01:24:20,577 --> 01:24:23,338
My men measure riches in gold.

509
01:24:26,576 --> 01:24:28,132
It is more.

510
01:24:31,409 --> 01:24:33,669
It is power and fame.

511
01:24:40,007 --> 01:24:42,096
I despise them for it.

512
01:24:44,606 --> 01:24:47,867
<i>I am sure, Aguirre is leading
us into destruction.</i>

513
01:24:47,972 --> 01:24:51,096
<i>I almost feel,
he does it deliberately.</i>

514
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:57,602
<i>We can't even get ashore, since
the river flooded the jungle for miles.</i>

515
01:25:03,802 --> 01:25:06,028
<i>February twenty-second.</i>

516
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:08,460
<i>The suffering is dreadful.</i>

517
01:25:08,901 --> 01:25:12,229
<i>Most men have fever
and hallucinations.</i>

518
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,191
<i>Hardly anyone can stand upright.</i>

519
01:25:15,599 --> 01:25:20,121
<i>The soldier Justo Gonzales drank
my ink, thinking it was medicine.</i>

520
01:25:21,132 --> 01:25:23,030
<i>I can no longer write.</i>

521
01:25:23,598 --> 01:25:25,621
<i>We are drifting in circles.</i>

522
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:56,142
I see a ship with sails...

523
01:26:56,614 --> 01:26:58,545
...in a tall tree...

524
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:03,376
...and from the stern hangs a canoe.

525
01:27:08,212 --> 01:27:10,905
The ship is in your imagination.

526
01:27:11,578 --> 01:27:14,236
No floodwaters could rise this high.

527
01:27:15,977 --> 01:27:18,067
We all have the fever.

528
01:27:20,077 --> 01:27:22,042
It is only a mirage.

529
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:28,140
These things happen when
people are overly exhausted.

530
01:27:28,642 --> 01:27:30,301
Shut up, monk!

531
01:27:30,408 --> 01:27:34,634
We'll get that ship! It is real!
We'll sail to the Atlantic with it.

532
01:27:34,973 --> 01:27:39,928
No, Lope de Aguirre, I won't go
with you. We are weak and hungry.

533
01:27:53,537 --> 01:27:57,991
That is no ship. That is no forest.

534
01:27:59,868 --> 01:28:01,891
That is no arrow.

535
01:28:02,968 --> 01:28:07,365
We just imagine the arrows,
because we fear them.

536
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,292
These arrows are real, take cover!

537
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,057
This arrow can't harm me.

538
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:25,993
This is not rain.

539
01:28:32,095 --> 01:28:35,391
Monk, do not forget to pray,
lest God's end...

540
01:28:37,795 --> 01:28:39,420
...will be uncomely.

541
01:29:55,314 --> 01:29:57,643
<i>When we reach the sea...</i>

542
01:29:58,113 --> 01:30:00,579
<i>...we will build a bigger ship...</i>

543
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:06,239
<i>...sail north and take Trinidad
from the Spanish crown.</i>

544
01:30:13,644 --> 01:30:16,201
<i>From there we'll sail on...</i>

545
01:30:16,942 --> 01:30:19,635
<i>...and take Mexico from Cortez.</i>

546
01:30:21,009 --> 01:30:24,338
<i>What great treachery this will be!</i>

547
01:30:25,641 --> 01:30:29,232
<i>Then, all of New Spain
will be in our hands...</i>

548
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:32,867
<i>...and we'll stage history...</i>

549
01:30:33,206 --> 01:30:36,502
<i>...like others stage plays.</i>

550
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:43,686
<i>I, the Wrath of God...</i>

551
01:31:45,227 --> 01:31:47,885
<i>...will marry my own daughter...</i>

552
01:31:49,393 --> 01:31:53,222
<i>...and with her I will found
the purest dynasty...</i>

553
01:31:53,826 --> 01:31:56,121
<i>...the earth has ever seen.</i>

554
01:31:56,925 --> 01:31:58,516
<i>Together...</i>

555
01:31:59,457 --> 01:32:02,980
<i>...we shall rule
this entire continent.</i>

556
01:32:10,289 --> 01:32:12,050
<i>We will endure.</i>

557
01:32:14,388 --> 01:32:17,081
I am the Wrath of God!

558
01:32:18,654 --> 01:32:20,710
Who else is with me?
