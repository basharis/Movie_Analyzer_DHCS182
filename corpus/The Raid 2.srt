1
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,427
It's a question of ambition really.

2
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,144
Let me rephrase that.

3
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,581
It's a matter of limitation.

4
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,751
And the importance
of knowing yours.

5
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,501
Your boss, Tama.
He had a reputation, yes.

6
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,790
But he also knew where he stood,
understood how high he should climb.

7
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,301
That's why Bangun let
him be the man he was.

8
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,024
Don't mind them.

9
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,462
I'm a reasonable man.

10
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,748
Like you, I have ambitions.

11
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,949
But you see, in this world of ours,

12
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,990
it's really more of a "one
step at a time" kind of thing.

13
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,348
And you should have been
some fucking steps away

14
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,344
from a meeting like this.

15
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,828
- Bangun will...
- Bangun is an old man!

16
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,229
He's on his way out.

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,784
I gave you a chance.

18
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,749
You chose him.

19
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,345
So...

20
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,791
I guess this brings us back
full circle, ambition...

21
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,226
and limitation.

22
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,620
Bejo. Bejo!

23
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,987
- Please don't do this.
- I already told you.

24
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,787
- Don't worry.
- No, no!

25
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,385
Don't, Bejo, wait!

26
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,503
You called?

27
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,105
Rama.

28
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,105
I know who you are.

29
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,425
My brother says

30
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,991
you're someone I can trust.

31
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,507
He's right.

32
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,308
They got you pretty bad.

33
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,304
Yes, sir, they did.

34
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,982
Take him through, get him treated.

35
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,149
Be careful.

36
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,150
No, wait! Stop!

37
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,382
What the fuck?! No!

38
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,025
- What the fuck was that?!
- It's okay. Just calm down.

39
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,621
Take a seat. Sit.

40
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,224
Take his jacket, gloves and
any official threads he has.

41
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,781
Dump him far away from here.

42
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,631
He'll float to shore by dawn.

43
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,464
Yes, sir.

44
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,344
Trust me.

45
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,542
He would've never
survived until morning.

46
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,344
This is the only way we can be sure
he won't say a word about you.

47
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,741
About us.

48
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,427
Us?

49
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,585
I run a unit that weeds out
crooked cops like him.

50
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,102
And I could do with someone like
you to help me dig out some more.

51
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,342
We're a small division.

52
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,068
But we're small for
a reason. Trust.

53
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,386
I have evidence.

54
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,271
We could've made a case.
I could've testified.

55
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,266
No, you have hearsay,
and a box of tapes.

56
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,227
I've been down that road
before. All it does is cough up

57
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,623
a few more names to take the heat.
All foot soldiers just like him.

58
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,864
No, if we're going to
clean up this city,

59
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,150
we have to aim higher. All of them.

60
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,661
Whether or not you like what happened
here today, they will come for you.

61
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,948
They'll do anything to remove
you from the equation.

62
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,029
If we don't act fast,

63
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,182
you'll be gone.

64
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,308
Your family too.

65
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,549
But it doesn't have to be that way.

66
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,750
Let's say we keep this internal.
If you keep your mouth shut

67
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,143
until everything is taken
care of, I can protect you.

68
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,505
For you,

69
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,221
today never happened.
You were never here.

70
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,991
In their eyes you're still
a rookie for fuck's sake.

71
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,065
They won't even blink an eye at
one name missing from the report.

72
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,708
Is this all of them?

73
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,101
All 18.

74
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,743
No survivors.

75
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,185
What do you think?

76
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,901
Reza.

77
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,990
I'll keep looking.

78
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,947
I'll take care of it personally.

79
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,424
You have to.

80
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,868
What do you want?

81
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,145
I want you on my team.

82
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,624
You'll be re-trained until
you have better skills.

83
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,260
For the good

84
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,986
of this city. What do you say?

85
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,511
No. Not interested.

86
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,344
- Come again?
- Sir,

87
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,911
with all due respect,

88
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,348
I brought him into do time. So
he could be brought to justice.

89
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,470
And we put a bullet in him
to protect your life!

90
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,749
There's no such thing as a clean
war in this world. Open your eyes!

91
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,307
My eyes are wide open, sir!

92
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,031
We may be after the same thing,

93
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,589
but I'm not going to follow the
same path as you to get there.

94
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,786
Who killed him?

95
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,544
My brother.

96
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,384
His name is Bejo.

97
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,349
He's been on the up
for some time now.

98
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,586
I know the name.

99
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,504
Rama,

100
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,061
your brother had big enemies.

101
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,748
But they're nothing compared
to what's coming for you.

102
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,863
I can provide safety for
your wife and child.

103
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,627
We can keep them out of
reach. But I need you.

104
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,390
Right now,

105
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,269
this city is carved up

106
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,741
between our local kingpin, Bangun,

107
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,380
and the Goto family from Japan.

108
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,505
Tama's job is to bribe everyone.

109
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,982
And the police are being bribed
at his office so no one knows.

110
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,905
If we get you close
enough to Bangun,

111
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,348
then sure as fuck we can weed out
the rest of those crooked bastards.

112
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,945
Rama,

113
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,190
for this to end,

114
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,104
I need those names.

115
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,467
I need evidence that Reza

116
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,021
is connected to Bangun.

117
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,701
So, what's the next step?

118
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,822
Uco, Bangun's only child.

119
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,028
He's serving time in prison.

120
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,591
It's the perfect opportunity.
Get in, get close.

121
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,945
Meaning?

122
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,310
I have to arrest you.

123
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,627
It will only be a few months.

124
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,580
You can't know where I am.

125
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,982
And I can't be seen
anywhere near you or Angga.

126
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,629
But if I don't do this,

127
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,306
I can't protect us this time.

128
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,228
Please understand.

129
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,902
This is the only
choice I have left.

130
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,388
He's out of the
hospital now, right?

131
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,588
I heard he was discharged.

132
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,703
Shut your fucking mouth!

133
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,223
You nod here.

134
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,221
Yes or no. Do you understand me?

135
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,987
So, what did he do?

136
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,741
What did he do?

137
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,223
Enough.

138
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,790
I need more than that.

139
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,627
He's the asshole son of
an asshole politician.

140
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,548
Can't you just put
me in, lock me up?

141
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,119
Why does this kid have to bleed?

142
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,861
His daddy is the reason
Uco is in prison.

143
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,341
If we're talking
earning credibility,

144
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,781
doing this puts you
immediately on his radar.

145
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,740
At the very least, it gives you
two something to talk about.

146
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,503
If you really want
me to beat him up,

147
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,869
I mean really beat him up,
I need a better reason.

148
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,588
He's also a major benefactor...

149
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,949
for Bejo.

150
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,741
Rama, listen,

151
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,341
do enough to get inside,

152
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,425
but not enough to keep
you there for good.

153
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,221
Where is he?

154
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,186
I believe Benny and his boys
introduced themselves yesterday?

155
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,266
Which one is Benny?

156
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,741
Him.

157
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,950
Now while I'm in here, Benny and
his associates are with me.

158
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,262
Oh, yeah? And who are you?

159
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,469
You'll figure that
out at some point.

160
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,464
And when you do, maybe you'll show
me a little more fucking respect.

161
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,587
But for now, I'll be tolerant.

162
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,749
So, what does that mean?

163
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,740
Want me to apologize?

164
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,746
This.

165
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,749
This is my "just in case."

166
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,147
There's never enough walls
to cover your back.

167
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,790
Even you.

168
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,341
Especially after your
little "display."

169
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,981
I'm someone who can put walls up.

170
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,302
I can cover your back in any
square inch of this place.

171
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,622
You may not know who I am now.

172
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,471
But when you do, you'll
realize how real my offer is.

173
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,270
Join with us

174
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,707
and own this wing with me.

175
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,861
We could use someone like
you fighting on our side.

176
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,831
I'm flattered but...

177
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,347
Just so you know,
I hate rejections.

178
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,989
With all due respect,

179
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,110
I don't really like spending my
time acting tough in toilets.

180
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,785
Excuse me.

181
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,669
Listen.

182
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,981
In here you'd be
wise to pick a side.

183
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,941
Loners don't tend to last long.

184
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,390
Clearly.

185
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,186
The warden tells me you've
got quite a group here.

186
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,063
I got who I could.

187
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,269
I'm working to get some of our
guys inside to cover your back.

188
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,821
But until I do, you got
to keep a low profile.

189
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,063
- You can't trust any of these fuckers.
- Low profile?

190
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,159
I'm my father's son.

191
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,184
That alone makes me a target here.

192
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,981
All I can do is use
that to protect myself.

193
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,985
Your job is to protect me here.

194
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,269
It would make my job a lot easier
if you'd cool things down here.

195
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,383
When was the last time
you did time, Eka?

196
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,862
Keeping quiet is not an option.

197
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,706
Unless I want to wake up every
morning with a broom up my ass.

198
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,310
Rather than lecturing me,
find out about that guy.

199
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,824
Why's he here?

200
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,910
Him?

201
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,543
He wheel-chaired your favorite
politician's kid in Fuazan's club.

202
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,546
Not bad.

203
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,788
His name's Yuda.
He's from the sticks.

204
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,749
- He's a nobody.
- Well, that "nobody"

205
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,062
- took out 15 of my guys.
- So he can fight,

206
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,261
so what?

207
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,186
He's clean, no connections
on the outside.

208
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,661
Who the fuck are you?

209
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,343
I'm the guy gifting you
five years of my graft

210
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,343
just so you can say you belong.

211
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,707
Since you walked in
through that door,

212
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,148
they've been eyeballing you. All
trying to get a feel for who you are.

213
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,621
But by me sitting here,

214
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,263
I just made you a somebody.

215
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,391
You can thank me later.

216
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,989
Oh, yeah, who do I thank for
the fucking three years I got?

217
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,227
Huh? Bunawar said I'd
be out in months,

218
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,620
not years.

219
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,262
Did you really think that crook politician
would stop at you being in here?

220
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,349
That it would make
things "even." Fair?

221
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,264
No.

222
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,141
No. You went after his son.
Be glad he didn't come after yours.

223
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,544
- I need you to talk to Bunawar...
- Ah, heh.

224
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,949
No, I'm just here to show my
face. And I did that already.

225
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,182
Now you're on your own.

226
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,031
Suck it up, don't fuck it up.

227
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,424
I rely on you now the same
way you relied on me.

228
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,427
Those bruises will heal.

229
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,270
How does it feel?

230
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,785
Different.

231
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,789
- Here, give me that.
- No need.

232
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,701
Just give it to me. If I'd parked further
away then, yeah, carry it yourself.

233
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,141
But this, this I got.

234
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,344
- It's good to have you out.
- I appreciate what you did for me.

235
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,423
You helped me a lot
while I was in there.

236
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,106
Pass on my thanks to your father.

237
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,149
You can do that yourself.

238
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,070
We're going to his office.

239
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,870
He wants to greet you personally.

240
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,261
- He doesn't have to.
- Yeah, he does.

241
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,510
Okay?

242
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,466
Do you know of a man
goes by the name Bejo?

243
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,425
Sounds familiar.

244
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,422
Half-Arab kid, made a name for himself
when he took out Yudi's group.

245
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,541
He's been making waves of late.

246
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,427
Owns a few restaurants,

247
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,390
takes care of problems
for high-profile clients.

248
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,950
The kind that can't afford
to carry a spotlight.

249
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,262
I know him, came to me way back

250
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,344
wanting collateral to set up shop.

251
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,103
I'm getting rumors that he's
looking to expand his operations.

252
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,625
Where?

253
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,509
That's where the rumors stop.

254
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,501
But it will be one of ours.

255
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,150
Yes, that's right.

256
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,622
I'm sorry, sir. He cannot
be disturbed momentarily.

257
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,270
Thank you.

258
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,430
- How long will my father be?
- He'll be done soon.

259
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,068
Excuse the mess.

260
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,669
It could be nothing.

261
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,187
I just thought you'd
want to know now.

262
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,344
While one of us can still take
care of a situation like him.

263
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,224
I'll have my men

264
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,541
monitor the situation.

265
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,101
If he steps out of line,
we'll take care of it.

266
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,271
- You have nothing to worry about.
- Who says I'm worried, asshole?

267
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,304
Heh. Thanks.

268
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,066
It's, "Thank you."

269
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,949
Ah... Mr. Goto.

270
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,908
Ah, there they are.

271
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,149
Mr. Goto.

272
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,106
Ah... We finally meet.

273
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,705
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Likewise, sir.

274
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,462
Your son speaks very highly of you.

275
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,385
Ah... And so he should.

276
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,862
I want you to know we tried
to get you out much sooner.

277
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,545
But you hurt the wrong person.

278
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,909
Let's just say his father made it
damn difficult to get you a pardon.

279
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,061
It's okay.

280
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,949
Besides, what's done is done.

281
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,070
You're out now. We move on.

282
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,188
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

283
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,183
Now take your fucking clothes off.

284
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,901
I'm sorry?

285
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,069
You heard me.

286
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,341
It's okay, Yuda, just
do what he says.

287
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,300
- Uco, come on, wait a...
- Shh. Listen.

288
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,707
It's not that I don't trust you.

289
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,147
I just don't trust anybody.

290
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,027
If the worse that happens
during your time with us

291
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,184
is that you suffer the indignity
of an old man seeing your cock,

292
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,867
then I'd say you got
off light. Take them off.

293
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,262
Everything.

294
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,904
Arms up.

295
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,341
Turn around.

296
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,071
Check them.

297
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,749
All clear.

298
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,310
Turn around.

299
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,429
Burn them anyway.
Give him something new.

300
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,264
Incinerator.

301
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,308
Now, it's like this:

302
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,224
I will always appreciate
what you did for my boy.

303
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,831
I'll never forget that.

304
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,304
But it's not a free pass with me.

305
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,667
I've thanked you in person.

306
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,263
And we'll make sure you're
looked after while you're here.

307
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,149
But when it comes to the work,

308
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,780
you're no more special
than anyone else.

309
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,664
If you fuck up, you're out.

310
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,461
I won't let you down.

311
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,022
So this is your place.

312
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,747
You have pretty much
everything you need.

313
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,384
Anything else,

314
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,509
just call and they'll
take care of it.

315
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,861
Thanks.

316
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,022
Bangun gave me everything I have.

317
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,184
Just like what he's doing
for you right now.

318
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,023
We come from the same
place, you and I.

319
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,586
I hope that's not where
our similarities end.

320
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,181
I'll pick you up tomorrow at 8:00.

321
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,707
Be ready at 7:00.

322
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,261
It's me.

323
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,468
What happened? We lost you.

324
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,266
You're gonna get me fucking killed.
Day one with a wire?

325
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,629
- Are you kidding me?
- You're fresh out of prison, they wouldn't...

326
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,909
Yeah, well, he fucking checked me
anyway. They burnt all my clothes.

327
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,107
Do they know?

328
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,911
If I hadn't torn that shit out
first, I'd have been burnt with it.

329
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,347
Don't play games with
me, no more surprises.

330
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,071
If you do that again, I'm out.

331
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,591
Where are you?

332
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,301
No, I'm not disclosing that, and don't
you dare trace this fucking call.

333
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,145
I don't want you or your team
within a mile of this place.

334
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,429
Calm down, the important
thing is you're safe.

335
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,060
I'm fucking serious, you
could have gotten me killed.

336
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,781
This guy, any hint at all,
and he will sniff it out.

337
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,064
From now on, you follow my lead.

338
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,382
I'll leave a pair of
shoes at our RV point.

339
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,783
Fix them up and I'll pick
them up when I'm ready.

340
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,751
You'll know I got them
once they start walking.

341
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,947
- Hold on, I need time to...
- Just get it done.

342
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,626
Angga, stop doing that.
I've told you before!

343
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,380
Hello?

344
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,349
Hello?

345
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,065
Isa.

346
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,147
Rama? Where are you?

347
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,711
Are you okay?

348
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,465
I'm safe.

349
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,503
Don't worry about me.

350
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,790
Isa,

351
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,631
everything just went...

352
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,822
I'm so sorry.

353
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,830
Are you both safe?

354
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,301
We're getting by.

355
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,784
Is that Angga?

356
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,908
Yes.

357
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,501
Please let me listen to him.

358
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,550
Don't put him on,
I just want to hear him.

359
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,940
Please.

360
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,551
Okay.

361
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,386
Thank you.

362
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,508
Yeah.

363
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,868
Ears to the ground.
Eyes everywhere.

364
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,069
With people like these, you can't
predict how they will react.

365
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,021
We could go in smiling
or storm in shooting.

366
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,989
And the reaction would
be exactly the same.

367
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,190
These people are reckless, they
don't have their shit together.

368
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,071
If they did, we wouldn't be side-stepping
puddles of piss to get to them.

369
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,188
Focus. Don't let your mind drift.

370
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,542
Not for a second.

371
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,589
Topan.

372
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,785
Uco.

373
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,826
Sorry. Can I help you
with anything else?

374
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,704
It's all there in the envelope.

375
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,385
This isn't enough.

376
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,544
Not enough?

377
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,829
But I counted it myself.
It's exact.

378
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,829
Oh, yeah. Go back a
month and you're right.

379
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,903
Just like always.

380
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,507
But this month, you're short $5000.

381
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,025
Take a seat.

382
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,626
Motherfucker, stop shaking around.

383
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,111
It hurts. It's too big.

384
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,104
Fuck this shit. Where the
fuck did you find this guy?

385
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,341
Hitchhiker.

386
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,027
You always bring me hitchhikers.
They have no experience.

387
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,508
Seriously, find some other people.

388
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,311
Let's shoot this thing,
you fucking loser!

389
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,226
Get on with it! Camera, rolling, shooting.
Just fuck that guy's asshole, you bitch!

390
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,462
I'll go there later.

391
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,224
Sorry.

392
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,589
I don't understand.
You're kidding, right?

393
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,347
Sit down.

394
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,025
So...

395
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,385
For 20 years, my father has ensured

396
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,350
that not one cop has ever
knocked on your door.

397
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,707
Now you've been free
to operate on our turf

398
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,386
and we've worked together
peacefully throughout.

399
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,871
But these payments

400
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,945
in these envelopes. They only
cover you for cock and cum.

401
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,791
They don't allow for any

402
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,789
expansions.

403
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,949
I'm hearing rumblings, Topan.

404
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,543
People are talking. Seems
that you and your boys here

405
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,062
are responsible for some powder
circulating in my father's territory.

406
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,188
No, that?

407
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,503
- That's just...
- You don't have to explain anything.

408
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,140
We already know everything.

409
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,906
Now, taking into account
this new enterprise of yours

410
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,143
and the fact you sure as hell
don't want some pig's knuckles

411
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,742
rapping at your door,
the price just went up.

412
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,581
All you have to do is dig
just a little bit deeper.

413
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,789
Then we can forgive you
this minor indiscretion.

414
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,067
Now if you would be so
kind, this envelope,

415
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,187
it's still a little light.

416
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,744
He did good.

417
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,823
Hounded him down
quickly and cleanly.

418
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,142
You'd swear he's been
doing it all his life.

419
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,711
Didn't take a wrong step.

420
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,830
Okay.

421
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,791
Uco, give this to the kid.

422
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,820
You handled the
situation well today.

423
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,462
They deserved it. You were right.

424
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,469
Keep it up.

425
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,105
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

426
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,705
Sir?

427
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,871
I was wondering,

428
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,307
what with the way
things have been...

429
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,509
Maybe it's time for me to start taking
on a little more responsibility.

430
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,742
Maybe handle some of our more...

431
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,510
Hold on.

432
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,542
When the time comes,
I'll know. But it's not now.

433
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,021
Not yet.

434
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,465
Okay?

435
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,746
Anything else?

436
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,861
No.

437
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,790
Okay, thank you, Uco.

438
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,183

No, I'm fine, thanks.

Come on, man, drink a little.

445
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,624
- Pour the man a drink.
- I'm fine, I've had enough.

446
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,903
If you won't drink, then sing at least.
You've been quiet since you got here.

447

Don't worry about me,
I'll just watch.

Fuck, you don't drink,

449
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,028
you won't sing. You should have
told me earlier. We could be

450
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,229
at a titty bar hooking up with Uzbeki
girls instead of sweating in here.

451
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,542
They only have cheap skanks.

452
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,981
Hey, who the fuck are
you calling skanks?

453
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,309
I'm better than you, and you
should know that already.

454
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,950
- Prick.
- Joanna, don't.

455
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,704
No, no, it's okay.

456
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,030
Joanna,

457
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,582
I'm the kind of guy that
you should be afraid of.

458
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,980
Just look at her.

459
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,745
- Oh, yeah?! And who the fuck are you?
- It's like this.

460
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,307
The place you work,
the place where you live.

461
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,066
The place where you
fuck your clients,

462
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,791
my father owns all of it.

463
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,223
And it's my job to make sure that
everyone who works in this city

464
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,428
remembers to show
their appreciation.

465
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,821
So you're a debt collector?

466
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,830
- Fuck it, I'll sing, give me the mike.
- No.

467
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,143
Let her talk. She's a big girl,

468
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,223
she can say what she wants.

469
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,506
Exactly.

470
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,181
Go ahead, keep drinking.
It'll numb the pain for later.

471
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,310
What did you just say?

472
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,383
I said,

473
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,065
it's your turn to sing.

474
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,666
I don't want to sing, I want
to know what you just said.

475
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,710
Just fucking sing! I'm tired
of listening to you, skank!

476
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,347
Yeah, that's you! Come on, sing!

477
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,107
I'm paying you to either sing
or fuck. Which is it? Pick one!

478
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,103
You wanna sing?
Okay, let's pick a song.

479
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,467
Want me to pick a song?
Where's the fucking songbook?

480
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,987
Quick, we're waiting to sing.

481
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,268
Hey! Don't fucking touch that!

482
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,751
Don't you fucking dare!

483
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,024
This is the problem
with this country.

484
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,941
Everyone promises everything.
Everything's yes, yes, yes!

485
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,586
But when the time comes
to collect, it all changes.

486
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,061
"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.
No, no." Bullshit!

487
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,506
But not tonight!

488
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,430
Now, sing.

Thank you.

00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,021
Are you okay?

503
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,582
I'm fine, I don't care
what some hooker says.

504
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,108
It's that she had the fucking nerve
to think she was allowed to say it.

505
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,382
I'm more than that.

506
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,708
More than all this.

507
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,664
It's my fucking time, Yuda. And
I want my father to know that.

508
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,266
- It won't be long now.
- Oh, yeah? When?

509
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,982
Wait here.

510
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,831
Hello?

511
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,950
I've seen many a man
fall before they should.

512
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,581
They could have lasted
a little longer

513
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,220
had they known when to stop.

514
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,950
But they don't.

515
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,502
In the end,

516
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,751
they all end up in the same place.

517
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,389
The same shallow ditch.

518
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,381
Under the same river.

519
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,350
Fill it with rocks.

520
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,509
That's the proof.

521
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,061
If you choose to follow
us, you follow us.

522
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,745
Simple as that.

523
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,902
They burn out real fast.

524
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,667
I see it in Uco.

525
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,065
I've tried to ignore it,
but it didn't work.

526
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,348
I know Uco has that fire.

527
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:07,582
I had to lose a lot in my life before I
could truly see that that was important.

528
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,911
I don't want the same
to happen to my boy.

529
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,189
He won't, sir.

530
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,264
The time I've known him, he
speaks nothing but highly of you.

531
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,068
I hope you're right.

532
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,621
But I know what my gut tells me.

533
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,861
Lately you're his shadow.

534
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,182
So take care of him.

535
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,385
If you see anything
weird, you tell me.

536
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,424
Otherwise, it's like I said,

537
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:43,346
falling in the same ditch
under the same river.

538
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,021
Hm. I hope for your
sake you can swim.

539
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,864
Toss them back in.
Nothing tastes good here.

540
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,503
The main difference between you
and I can be defined by one word.

541
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,909
Legacy.

542
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:36,391
Every step I take is a step
forward for my group and family.

543
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,465
Every step that you take

544
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,426
is cloaked in the
shadow of your father.

545
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,222
In my life,

546
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,821
I never have to follow
anyone's rules.

547
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,343
No expectations of
who I should become.

548
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,342
No rules to abide by.

549
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,704
My father,

550
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,627
he was a fucking road sweeper.

551
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:15,263
Shining shoes would have made me
a success story compared to him.

552
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,983
So, yes,

553
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,541
you and I, we couldn't
be more different.

554
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,902
But deep inside, our
ambitions are the same.

555
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,741
After all, you came here
of your own accord.

556
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,829
Now we've eaten well,
drank good wine,

557
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:47,143
there's one thing that you
should know about me.

558
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,944
If I'm the type of person who
likes to impose my will,

559
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,024
I would've already pointed
a gun at your head.

560
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,511
But no, that's not me.

561
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,949
Not today at least.

562
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,387
Today I'm offering you a gift.

563
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,390
An opportunity.

564
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,866
Something that has never been
given to you by your father.

565
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,547
Please.

566
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,471
Those prison gates opened
and not one person

567
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,305
from your group was
there to pick them up.

568
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,224
I was surprised.

569
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,348
Imagine

570
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,630
how surprised they were when
they found out I picked them up

571
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,788
and brought them here

572
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,466
for you.

573
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,671
That's my gift.

574
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,101
I give you the opportunity...

575
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,067
to claim revenge.

576
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:52,661
And after that?

577
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,062
We talk business.

578
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,071
Just so you know,

579
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,781
- if you need financial help...
- I need labor.

580
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,546
Oh, that I can do.

581
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,623
So, what do you want exactly?

582
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,226
I've got my eye on
this patch of land.

583
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,982
Whose land?

584
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,351
That's why I need your help.

585
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,267
There are only two possibilities.

586
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,340
I'm sorry.

587
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,468
But with all due respect,

588
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,384
if I wanted to rent a patch of land

589
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,828
fair and square, I'd be
meeting your father.

590
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,390
Not you.

591
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,064
It belongs to the Japanese.

592
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,347
Huh.

593
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,743
The spot is perfect for
me to start my business.

594
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,261
Then why are you meeting with me?

595
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,627
It's their land.

596
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,907
My father would never allow it.

597
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,586
He would never do anything
to disrupt the truce.

598
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,788
I'm not interested in
what your father thinks.

599
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,784
I need your support,
and if I can be frank,

600
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,307
it seems you need my support also.

601
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,265
What do you mean?

602
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,549
I heard the top brass aren't
happy with your father anymore.

603
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:41,107
Times are changing. The Goto family
is starting to make connections.

604
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,547
Top connections.

605
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,783
When your father leaves the
office, he goes home, he sleeps.

606
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:50,990
Meanwhile, Goto's boy is taking
Reza to a club and partying.

607
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,341
Just so you know...

608
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:57,540
It's easy to sway a cop or a politician
with a little cash and a lot of pussy.

609
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,908
What do you want?

610
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,509
Give me your word, and I'll
put an end to the truce.

611
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,826
Put your faith in me and I'll tip the
odds in your favor when the war begins.

612
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,186
Let them all see

613
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:19,267
how you took charge and made your
family bigger than it's ever been.

614
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,669
And you? What's in it for you?

615
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,831
Everyone has their limit.

616
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,350
After we take over Goto's territory, I just
want a small patch that I can use freely

617
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,307
without having to pay anyone.

618
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,666
No questions asked.

619
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,502
And how do you propose to
start a war between us?

620
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,788
Not a drop of blood has been
spilled in over 10 years.

621
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,709
Well, that would have to change.

622
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,307
- Unh! Unh! Unh!
- Shh, shh, shh.

623
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,265
Shh, shh...

624
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,384
Good boy.

625
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,187
If you expect my father
to put his men to war

626
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,501
with the Gotos,

627
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,664
it'll take a lot more than just
the death of foot soldiers.

628
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:48,506
I already have someone in mind.

629
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,303
Okay, so same time next month.

630
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,061
Uh, Dwi, wait.

631
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,421
What is it?

632
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:06,229
- What about Karim?
- What about him?

633
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,506
Dwi.

634
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,025
You promised.

635
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,706
I said when the time is right.

636
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,947
Not yet.

637
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,027
His friends come here often, 'Koso.

638
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,908
Do you think he wants to explain
to them that this is his father?

639
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:29,101
You don't have to
do that, I get it.

640
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:33,584
- But I haven't seen him since he was...
- Yeah, and whose choice was that?

641
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,903
Yours, right? You're the one
who chose to do what you do.

642
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,108
To support you.

643
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,622
There are millions of fathers in the
world supporting their families.

644
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:46,306
Only they don't come home
with blood on their hands.

645
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,464
Do you even realize that what you
do is so fucking disgusting?

646
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,070
- I'm not a smart man.
- No, you're not.

647
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,549
But you used to be a good person.

648
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:04,069
That means that I still have the
right to see my son, right?

649
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,144
That's the thing, you don't.

650
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,347
Not like this.

651
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,504
And I don't want to hear anymore
about you wanting to change.

652
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,221
Because it's been 15 years already,
and I barely recognize you anymore.

653
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,663
I'm sorry, I have to go.

654
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,188
As always.

655
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,511
Crazy.

656
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,504
Seems anyone can get
in here these days.

657
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,185
Way back this place had class.

658
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,741
But now you see white guys
walking around in sandals

659
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,347
drinking beer and fucking cheap skanks
in the toilets like fucking animals.

660
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,901
It's a fucking disgrace.

661
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,348
Everything has to be restarted from
the beginning. Starting from us.

662
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,990
Like it was before.

663
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,029
Back then, if my father turned
up, the room would freeze.

664
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,944
They'd fear him

665
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,068
because they knew he
could do anything.

666
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,588
Times change.

667
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,586
They may not fear him
like they used to,

668
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,141
but your father hasn't lost
that fire in his stomach.

669
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:27,425
He just learned how to control it.
They respect him now.

670
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,423
He doesn't need fear anymore.

671
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,663
He has their respect and
that's what counts the most.

672
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,060
It used to count.

673
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,985
Used to. Not anymore.

674
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,507
Times change faster than you think.

675
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,550
We got people now who don't
give a shit about back then.

676
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,190
They only care about now.

677
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,184
Respect? That doesn't
mean shit to them.

678
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:51,186
That ain't new. We faced punks like that
more times than I care to remember.

679
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,304
Trust me,

680
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,542
they don't last.

681
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,982
And when it's your turn to take the
reins, you'll see for yourself.

682
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,622
They'll burn and fall in front of you
just like they did for your father.

683
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,984
That same fire is in you.

684
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,381
I've seen it ever since
you were a child.

685
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,070
Don't ever lose it.

686
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,149
Learn to control it.

687
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,782
If you do, one day you'll
become as great as your father.

688
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,024
'Koso,

689
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,786
you've always been a
good friend to us.

690
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,068
Your father has always
taken good care of me.

691
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,668
To family.

692
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,063
I'll be right back, gotta piss.

693
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:53,745
Argh!

694
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,347
The Chinks say they saw the Japs
attacking 'Koso in that alleyway.

695
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,190
Can you believe that shit?

696
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:01,187
After all this time, they fuck us
like this? We have to respond.

697
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,429
Busting some heads and going to
war are two very different things.

698
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:08,749
Prakoso's line of work
made him enemies.

699
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,870
Not just the Gotos. Hell, even
the Chinese wanted his head.

700
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,781
This wasn't the first time
he'd been under attack.

701
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,185
Sadly it was the last.

702
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,186
- Where the fuck have you been?
- What happened?

703
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,664
After everything he did for us,

704
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,862
this is how we repay him?

705
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,706
All 'Koso ever cared for
in the world was his wife

706
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,464
and kid.

707
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:39,661
He had no time for
making things personal.

708
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:42,551
So from now, our duty is to
take care of his family.

709
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,987
But we will not retaliate.

710
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,780
Are you kidding me?

711
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,786
Eka, talk some sense into him.

712
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,908
We're losing our hold here.

713
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,146
Sir,

714
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,746
we have ruled this territory
for over 30 years!

715
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:05,501
And my decision on this will
see us through 30 more!

716
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,150
Stand down.

717
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,667
Cool off! Relax.

718
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,744
You should remember

719
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,380
your place.

720
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,545
Uco.

721
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,471
Yuda...

722
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,946
watch over him, take him out,

723
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,711
make him forget about this.
Find him a girl,

724
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,749
so he'll get his mind off this.

725
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,110
Yes, boss.

726
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,301
Unbelievable.

727
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,420
Eka...

728
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,469
this is no good.

729
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,388
No good at all.

730
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,940
Uco.

731
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,590
Uco.

732
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,101
- What's wrong?
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

733
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,341
Your father's right.

734
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,549
If you rush into this it won't
help, it will make things worse.

735
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,702
Well, you've grown all of a sudden.

736
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,504
This is a shitty situation,

737
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:32,061
but you have to refrain yourself.
I've lost control before,

738
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,700
and look where it got me.

739
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:37,820
Look where it got you? It got you a
fucking penthouse suite that I pay for.

740
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,749
I'm just trying to help,
I know how much your father...

741
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,629
Shut the fuck up!

742
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,828
Who the fuck do you
think you are? Huh?

743
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,142
You think you know my father?

744
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,109
You mean nothing to him.

745
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,906
We only owed you and
we paid it back.

746
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,428
After that, we're just
going to cut you free.

747
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,584
What? Did you expect more?

748
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,945
Go fuck yourself.

749
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,631
- Did we get the okay?
- Fuck the okay.

750
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,703
Just do it.

751
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,311
Do it.

752
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,751
Time for work.

753
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,385
How many?

754
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,381
A few.

755
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,828
Please, have mercy.

756
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,186
Give me the ball.

757
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,861
That was a mistake.

758
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,581
No, wait, don't!

759
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,271
No!

760
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:57,420
- Where to?
- Tanah Abang.

761
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,505
Enough.

762
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:11,105
Now

763
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,501
everything has to stop.

764
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,222
Mr. Goto.

765
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,509
Mr. Bangun.

766
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,389
We acknowledge...

767
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,744
this conflict

768
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,109
between your groups

769
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:31,150
is the first one in 10 years.

770
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,424
There are many casualties.

771
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:40,743
If this continues,

772
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:44,386
we will disband both
of your groups.

773
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:46,622
We only acted in retaliation.

774
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:50,990
Retaliation? And how the fuck you
explain what happened to Prakoso?

775
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,383
That was never an order of ours.

776
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,271
Those men had no ties
to my father's group.

777
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,422
Oh, yeah. Who was it?

778
01:39:58,480 --> 01:39:59,911
Maybe you know.

779
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:07,589
Sir,

780
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:09,629
with all due respect,

781
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,989
but the man you're talking about
was like a brother to my father

782
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:17,668
and uncle to me. A man of loyalty
to our family for over 30 years.

783
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,060
If you speak ill of him again,

784
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:21,302
- I swear to God...
- Enough!

785
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,269
Only a fool

786
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:26,663
argues for the pride of a dead man.

787
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,905
Mr. Goto,

788
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,101
my apologies.

789
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,786
It's fine.

790
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,380
I accept full responsibility
for all that has happened.

791
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,905
What?

792
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:44,581
It seems decisions have been made
by members of my organization

793
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,305
who are less intelligent

794
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:48,110
and less experienced.

795
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,910
For that I can only apologize.

796
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:52,108
And for all that has
happened this past week.

797
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,830
I will pay all the damages.

798
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:56,904
To prevent bloodshed
between our families.

799
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,025
Thank you for your
swift resolution.

800
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:06,627
Yeah. Now, gentlemen,
if you'll excuse me.

801
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:08,828
I have to go back
to my organization.

802
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,550
Of course.

803
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,384
Excuse me.

804
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:35,471
I heard what happened,
are you okay?

805
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,861
What the fuck is going on?

806
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:40,950
Why are the cops attacking me?
Who the fuck made that call?

807
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,784
Calm down.

808
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,666
So far everything seems to suggest
this was purely territorial.

809
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,147
Seems Reza has his men
supporting the Goto family.

810
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:52,065
- Pull me out now.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

811
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,420
What do you mean, you can't?
What have I not witnessed?

812
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,384
Murder, extortion, bribery?

813
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:58,741
Corruption.

814
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,621
You were never investigating
Bangun, you knew that.

815
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:05,386
We want the cops they pay.

816
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:08,589
You think you're alone in this?
This isn't your show.

817
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,742
None of us are heroes.

818
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,871
We're all caught in
a big fucking web.

819
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,431
Listen.

820
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,231
Your identity is safe.

821
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:52,871
Yuda, where the fuck have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.

822
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:55,421
Get your ass to the office now
and get Uco the fuck out.

823
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,901
I can't hold back Bangun anymore.

824
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:27,628
Do you realize how many men we lost
just to play your fucking game? Huh?

825
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,068
Everything I've built was for you.

826
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:35,582
Everything was for you!
And you brought it to the ground.

827
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:38,425
You destroyed it completely. Huh?

828
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,907
And for what?

829
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,668
For what?

830
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,261
Huh?

831
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:49,821
Tell me why. Huh? Huh?

832
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:52,142
Come on, tell me.

833
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:53,301
For what?

834
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,191
Please, Dad, please...
Listen to me... Dad, please...

835
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,263
Dad, listen.

836
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:01,151
- For what?
- Fuck!

837
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:05,021
You say you're ashamed of me,
well, I'm ashamed of you!

838
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,342
What the fuck was
that back there? Huh?

839
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,861
Where's your self-respect?

840
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:13,184
Apologizing to those motherfuckers.

841
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:15,223
And in their language,

842
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,986
on our land!

843
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:22,344
You want to know what
drove me to this?

844
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:27,384
I'm tired. Tired of waiting.

845
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:32,145
I'm tired watching you just
sit back and do nothing.

846
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:38,585
You had your moment. But where's
mine? What the fuck do I get?

847
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,785
Shaking down junkies
for bit change?

848
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:46,103
That's not the role
of a future boss.

849
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:49,504
That's not work you give a boss!

850
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:53,746
You've destroyed us.

851
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:56,267
You've destroyed everything.

852
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:03,188
Dad.

853
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:07,629
Dad, everything we've lost,

854
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,703
we can get back.

855
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:12,187
We can get it all back.

856
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:14,820
Dad, trust in me, I can fix this.

857
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:19,030
I can fix this.

858
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,664
Okay, that's enough.

859
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:25,744
Enough.

860
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:36,707
Eka, prepare a peace
package for the Gotos.

861
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:39,386
We'll give them our land
in Menteng and Sabang.

862
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:40,667
Got it?

863
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,663
Yes, boss.

864
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,907
You can't go in there. He's in...

865
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,142
Forgive me.

866
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:57,106
You fucking traitor.

867
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:15,582
How could you do this, Uco?

868
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,510
Eka, run!

869
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:24,907
What do you want to do with him?

870
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,463
Take him.

871
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:23,824
What's that?

872
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:29,744
Yeah, I understand.

873
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:33,945
I'll call you back.

874
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:49,465
Reza was just seen entering
Bejo's restaurant.

875
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:55,027
I thought we'd secured
his services.

876
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:58,551
That was my understanding.

877
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:06,386
Then why the fuck
is he meeting Bejo?

878
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:16,711
Well?

879
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,709
Bejo

880
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:23,387
is a fucking nobody,
take care of him now.

881
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:28,586
- As for Reza and the rest of them...
- Boss, wait.

882
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:35,751
Bejo's not alone.

883
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,224
He has Uco with him.

884
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:43,550
Seems they joined forces

885
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:45,668
after taking out Bangun.

886
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:50,303
Point blank to the head.

887
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:54,790
Bejo

888
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:58,390
has serious numbers now.

889
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:01,022
He's becoming a genuine threat.

890
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,547
Heh.

891
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:06,667
Anything is possible.

892
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:09,906
What should we do?

893
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:12,381
We go to war!

894
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:15,980
If he pulled a trigger
on his own father,

895
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:19,386
he won't hesitate to come for us.

896
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,662
We start over.

897
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:28,062
I want Uco and Bejo in
the ground by tonight.

898
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,620
Reza and the rest of
those crooks too.

899
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:33,868
Wait a minute, you
can't be serious.

900
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:38,147
They're not cops anymore.

901
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:41,548
They're in my world now.

902
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:05,509
Eka! Eka!

903
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,907
I know who you are.

904
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:15,300
I know where you're from.

905
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,228
I told you before...

906
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:27,866
we come from the same place.

907
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:32,304
I hope...

908
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:35,747
Our fates don't end up the same.

909
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:41,582
I don't care what they say.

910
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:45,663
I'm not a traitor.

911
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,670
I'm not a fucking criminal.

912
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,429
There's no end to this.

913
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:56,790
You try to run...

914
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,068
they hound you down.

915
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:04,902
They lose a head?

916
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:08,948
It just grows right fucking back.

917
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,389
If you want out...

918
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:19,268
you put them down.

919
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:23,661
All of them.

920
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,106
Eka, wait.

921
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:41,309
Why the fuck didn't you tell me you had
an undercover in there with Bangun?

922
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,144
What are you talking about?

923
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:44,790
Eka.

924
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:46,430
That piece of shit?

925
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:48,264
That piece of shit saved my life.

926
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:54,109
Yeah, he also cost the lives of 10
honest cops when he fed us bad intel.

927
02:02:54,160 --> 02:02:56,627
He went rogue, Rama.

928
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:59,824
And it never crossed your
mind to mention it to me?

929
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:03,429
Now's not the time for this.
The commissioner is dead.

930
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,782
Fucking bodies are piling
up all over the city.

931
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:09,381
There's no such thing as
a clean war, lieutenant.

932
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:12,868
Maybe not. But we can
trace it to Reza.

933
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:15,307
We picked him up on Uco's wire.

934
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:18,830
They're together?

935
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:20,744
As far as we know.

936
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:24,825
We lost the signal,
but we're on our way.

937
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:30,501
I'm going to ask you one question.

938
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:32,742
And it's the only answer I want.

939
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:35,150
Is my family safe?

940
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:37,223
Yes, of course.

941
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:41,710
- Keep them that way.
- Wait, Rama, wait...

942
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:50,269
Watch over me.

943
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:43,707
Sir, would you like a tissue?

944
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:45,624
You better come here if you
want your fucking tip.

945
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:47,430
Yes, sir.

946
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:54,665
I'm sorry, sir.

947
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:28,743
Of course we can.

948
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,948
We're the ones who will set it up.

949
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:35,229
The important thing is the reward.

950
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:38,509
New faces. New prices.

951
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:40,185
New prices?

952
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:43,071
Come on, Reza.

953
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:46,064
Just think of it as
a probation period.

954
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:49,828
How much did Goto pay you?

955
02:07:50,120 --> 02:07:52,746
That's not a smart question to ask.

956
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:55,870
Oh, yeah, and why's that?

957
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:59,422
Because I'm meeting you, not him.

958
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:01,543
Now think up a number.

959
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:05,227
If it keeps me here after
dinner, then it's enough. Hm?

960
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:12,221
Hey, sidekick.

961
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:16,107
You're talkative.

962
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:18,145
Hm?

963
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:26,863
Boss.

964
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:29,148
He escaped from the car.

965
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:34,030
Put the word out.

966
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:36,660
Whoever finds him will be...

967
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:38,310
He's here.

968
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:40,383
He's coming up.

969
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:45,310
- Then hold him off.
- Yes, boss.

970
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:48,546
Everything okay?

971
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:54,341
Take care of it.

972
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:07,349
Reza,

973
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:09,307
don't worry.

974
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:11,906
Everything is under control.

975
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:13,471
They are more than capable of...

976
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:18,224
Motherfucker.

977
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:43,501
Give me the ball.

978
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,031
As usual.

979
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:15,951
No!

980
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:24,947
Ah...

981
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:36,230
Reza!

982
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:44,701
No...

983
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:48,866
I'm done.
