1
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,999
Park Street.

2
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,749
- Tollygunge.
- Dum Dum.

3
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,124
Passengers are advised...

4
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,999
To inform the Metro
Police on finding...

5
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,999
Any unidentified
box or alien object.

6
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,249
The door is closing.

7
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,707
Hello.

8
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,082
Yes, I am on the train.

9
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,790
Which bag?

10
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,749
Speak louder.

11
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,207
Which bag?

12
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,540
Next station Ravindra Station.

13
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,249
Platform on the right hand side.

14
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,207
Why is she crying so much?

15
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,499
She's hungry.

16
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,082
Why don't you feed her?

17
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,582
I forgot her m ilk bottle at home.

18
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,749
Yesterday I bought a new game,
Call Of Duty: Black Cops.

19
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,790
What a game. Great graphics.

20
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,665
Look, there's Kushal.

21
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,082
Kushal, why are you so scared.

22
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,665
Give it. Give the bag.
Why are you scared?

23
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,249
What are you hiding in your bag?
Is it something special?

24
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,999
What are you hiding in your bag?

25
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,124
Give the bag. Give the bag.

26
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,332
What are you hiding in your bag?

27
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,999
I will go back home.

28
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,290
Come on. Come on, let's go.

29
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,790
Show me the bag.

30
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,165
Hey, you left your bag behind.

31
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,499
The milk bottle is right here.

32
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,332
More than 100 are
expected to be dead...

33
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,874
In Kolkata Metro Rail due
to the deadly gas attack.

34
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,957
It's believed that a terrorist
group is behind this attack.

35
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,915
Even on the third day passengers
are hesitating to travel by the Metro.

36
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,624
The relatives of those...

37
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,832
Who died in the gas attack
staged a rally in Kolkata today.

38
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,749
And requested the government...

39
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,832
To find out who is
responsible for this attack.

40
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,391
Madam.

41
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,040
Madam. Madam. Come with me.

42
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,165
Who are you?

43
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,207
What do you want?

44
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:28,457
Move, move.

45
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,040
You shouldn't lift heavy
objects in such a condition...

46
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,540
Move. Go away.

47
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,165
You shouldn't lift heavy
objects in such a condition.

48
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,665
Let me, let me.

49
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,999
- Leave it.
- I know, I have a kid too.

50
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,457
Let me, madam . Please.

51
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,290
Move aside. Move.

52
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,499
You are taking my passenger.

53
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,915
Madam, please come with me.

54
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,332
Please move.

55
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,082
Don't mind, madam. But
can I ask you something?

56
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,832
I have been driving a
taxi for the past 15 years.

57
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,207
Every passenger either goes home
or to the hotel from the airport.

58
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,749
You are the first passenger who is
going straight to a police station.

59
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,832
Get the tea quickly.

60
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,874
Press any key.

61
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,665
It's up, it's up, it's up...

62
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,457
Here it is.

63
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,707
It's here.

64
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,707
It's working!

65
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,999
It's shut down again.

66
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,207
What happened now?

67
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,290
That's what his wife
must be saying every night.

68
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,915
Sign here.

69
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,624
Madam, here's the police station.

70
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,040
How much?

71
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,499
Here's your bag.

72
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,790
Madam, this is my number.

73
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,082
If you ever need a taxi, call me.

74
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,332
Thank you.

75
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,999
Where do I go to file a
missing person's report?

76
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,457
Yes, you go... I...

77
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,874
Just go straight... I mean,
it's just straight ahead.

78
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,082
Thank you.

79
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,999
Shall I carry this?

80
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,207
- Thanks.
- It's okay.

81
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,374
My husband is missing.

82
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,332
Are you coming from out of town?

83
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,082
London.

84
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,165
You arrived just now?

85
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,540
Yes.

86
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,040
Madam.

87
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,832
We will need some details.

88
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,124
- Actually, a month ago...
- Tea.

89
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:51,999
Will you have tea?

90
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:52,999
No.

91
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,332
- Yes, go ahead.
- He came to Kolkata a month ago.

92
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,832
He had a two week assignment
in the National Data Centre.

93
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,999
- Okay.
- First two weeks we would talk every day.

94
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,957
Then he suddenly stopped calling.

95
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,624
No messages or anything.

96
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,915
And I didn't know what to do.

97
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,749
So I came here directly. I...

98
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,665
Speak softly.

99
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,790
Doesn't my time have any value?

100
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,915
Why are you screaming? No need
to shout. He can hear you clearly.

101
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:19,707
Your name.

102
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,999
Vidya Bagchi.

103
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,040
Bidya Bagchi.

104
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,415
No, it's Vidya. With a V.

105
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,082
Madam, in Kolkata Vidya,
Bidya... same feelings.

106
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,999
- Isn't it, Rana?
- What?

107
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,915
Vidya, Bidya are all
the same, isn't it?

108
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,082
Your husband's name?

109
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,874
- Arnab.
- Bagchi?

110
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,707
Arnab...

111
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,207
Stop messing with it Rana.

112
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:48,999
Sorry.

113
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:49,999
And age?

114
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,124
33.

115
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,290
Complexion.

116
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,540
Wheatish.

117
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,915
Height?

118
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,624
A little taller than this.

119
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,499
5'11?

120
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,999
- Do you have a photograph?
- Yes.

121
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,707
Doesn't my case have any value?

122
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:07,999
- Doesn't my case have any value?
- Softly. Softly.

123
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,749
- What softly?
- You will speak softly or else I will throw you out.

124
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,790
He is listening to
what you are saying.

125
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,040
Love marriage.

126
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,249
Is this a year old?

127
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,040
No, two years.

128
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,290
Don't you have a latest one?

129
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,790
No... Arnab didn't like
to get his pictures taken.

130
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,374
“Isn't it enough that we
ran away and got married?”

131
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,165
- 'Now we have to get a picture taken as well.”
- Come here.

132
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,999
Otherwise what's
the proof that you married me?”.

133
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,707
It was the day we got married...

134
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,040
- So I forced him to get our picture taken.
- I see.

135
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,290
What does your husband do?

136
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,999
We both were software engineers.

137
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,457
- Firewall experts.
- Firewall?

138
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:56,415
We make programs to save
computers from virus attacks.

139
00:13:56,666 --> 00:14:00,999
Like, the police...
Protects the public. Right?

140
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,624
Get this done quickly.

141
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,499
Arnab was supposed to come to London
after the assignment, but he didn't.

142
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,832
He suddenly vanished.

143
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,332
- Vanished?
- Yes, I mean no messages, no calls.

144
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,207
And Arnab isn't like that.

145
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,332
Where was he staying here?

146
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,999
- Mona Lisa, 172A.
- Sarat Bose Road.

147
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,874
- The place where he worked name?
- National Data Centre.

148
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,082
Yes.- But they said that Arnab
never came there for any assignment.

149
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,124
He did, I know.

150
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,082
We talked every day.

151
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:36,124
He would call me a thousand
times in a day and I would scold him.

152
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,874
So that he doesn't spend his
entire earning on the phone bill.

153
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,790
But I don't know why they are lying.

154
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,207
The case is slightly complicated.

155
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,124
I will do my best. It will be done.

156
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,207
It will take some time.
I will get it done.

157
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,707
Madam, you will need to sign this.

158
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,124
Sign, sign.

159
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,874
Why are you after that thing?

160
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,124
Leave it.

161
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,707
May I help?

162
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,332
- You?
- Oh yes, you are a computer person...

163
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,999
Take a look.

164
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,207
What a pain...

165
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,124
You just needed to clear some memory.

166
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,999
You won't face any problem now.

167
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,332
Are you satisfied now?

168
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,832
Now, madam, you just need to
sign and you're free to go.

169
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,999
What happened, madam?

170
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,124
Sit, sit.

171
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,999
Would you like some water?

172
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,332
Will you call a taxi for me, please?

173
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,874
Why, Taxi? Rana will drop you.

174
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,915
Rana, go drop her. Go.

175
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,165
Come.

176
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,499
How much further?

177
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,124
Its close-by.

178
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,207
Are you feeling better now?

179
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,457
Is this your first visit to Kolkata?

180
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,915
Yes.

181
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,415
Entire Kolkata is getting
ready for the Puja, right.

182
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,832
So you know about 'Durga Puja'?

183
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,999
I have a Bengali husband remember...

184
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,999
By the way, your name Vidya is
also a very common Bengali name.

185
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,624
Vidya.

186
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,165
I know.

187
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,082
Courtesy Mr. Chatterjee.

188
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,707
By the way, why do they call you Rana?

189
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,499
Your name... The name
tag reads Satyoki.

190
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,707
In Kolkata everyone has two names.

191
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,999
One is 'Dak' name, which is
pet name like mine is Rana.

192
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,957
And the other is
“Bhalo' name, official name.

193
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,165
Satyoki.

194
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,540
But everyone
addresses me by my pet name.

195
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:01,957
Interesting. Two names
for the same person.

196
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,624
Two identities.

197
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,999
Satyoki. Arjun's charioteer.

198
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,165
Guesthouse?

199
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,707
Have we reached the hotel?

200
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,332
Mrs. Bagchi, this
doesn't look like a hotel.

201
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,582
Are you sure this is the place?

202
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,165
That's the address.

203
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,999
Why would your husband stay here?

204
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,165
I don't know.

205
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,624
Come.

206
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,832
Good evening. Are
you the manager here?

207
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,499
Yes.

208
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,957
I am Vidya Bagchi. I had
called you from London...

209
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,790
About my husband Arnab.

210
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,332
Yes, yes. Arnab Bagchi.

211
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,999
- Your Majesty, you...
- Look, I am not the queen.

212
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,374
You can call me Vidya.

213
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,790
Bidya madam, when you
called from London...

214
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,665
I told you that your
husband wasn't staying here.

215
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,457
The situation is
still the same. Arnab...

216
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,332
You've been saying
that all the while...

217
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,790
And that's exactly why I came here.

218
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:43,290
I know this because he would
talk to me every day from right here.

219
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,707
- Sir, please explain to her...
- Wait, wait.

220
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,624
Mrs. Bagchi, maybe
there's confusion.

221
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,290
There's absolutely no confusion.

222
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,457
Arnab was staying here.

223
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,790
This man is lying.
Show me your records.

224
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,332
Register. Get the register.

225
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,374
This.

226
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,290
Are these your records?

227
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,290
- Yes.
- Don't you have a computer?

228
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,332
- Computer?
- Madam, only 5-star hotels have computers.

229
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,832
This is a guesthouse.

230
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,124
0-star.

231
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,957
Arnab stayed here
and I can prove that.

232
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,040
If you walk towards the lift...

233
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,249
There's a peacock statue there.

234
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,332
Arnab used to say that...

235
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,915
The peacock of Tamil Nadu
has followed me here too.

236
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,249
Which way is the lift?

237
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,540
That way.

238
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,707
- Is it or not?
- There is.

239
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,374
- Then?
- There is a peacock.

240
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,124
But your husband isn't here.

241
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,374
- I mean, he wasn't.
- You think this is a joke?

242
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,999
The peacock's really there.

243
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,249
- But how do you know?
- Exactly.

244
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,415
If Arnab didn't tell me
about it, then how do I know?

245
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,832
I don't know why everyone's lying.

246
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,665
What, sir? Talk to me.

247
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,374
Arnab wasn't staying here, right?

248
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,374
But I will.

249
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,915
I will stay in room no.15.

250
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,124
Mrs. Bagchi, are you sure.

251
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,749
I am absolutely sure.

252
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,040
Will you give me the key?

253
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,165
Sign here.

254
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,999
Here?

255
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,999
“My dear wife, Why are
you standing at the door?”

256
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,457
“You are so late”

257
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,290
“I've been waiting for so long
even your phone was unreachable.”

258
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,999
“And what if I hadn't returned?”

259
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,415
“Then I would've kept waiting...”

260
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:45,999
It started raining suddenly.

261
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,499
Business is down.

262
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,832
- Absolutely.
- Exactly.

263
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,249
Your maj... No.

264
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,915
Good morning, Bidya madam.

265
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,165
Its Vidya, not Bidya.

266
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,624
V, not B.

267
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,082
Whatever you say, Bidya madam.

268
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,499
There's no hot water in the room.

269
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,624
- I know.
- You... You know.

270
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,457
Then why did you put up a
board saying 'Running hot-water'.

271
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:06,915
That?

272
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,124
I tell you.

273
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,749
Bishnu. Bishnu.

274
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,665
Come here. Come here.

275
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:12,915
Come.

276
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,124
Madam, he's Bishnu.

277
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,415
If you want hot
water then call Bishnu.

278
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,332
He will come running
with the hot water.

279
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,665
Running hot water ...our Bishnu.

280
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,582
How do I go to Camac Street?

281
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,582
You will get a bus, or a taxi outside.

282
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,999
Bishnu, show madam.

283
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,332
- Come Didi.
- Come on.

284
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,124
- What is that?
- Don't ask for that.

285
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,082
That's his radio. His life.
He will never give it.

286
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:37,915
Come on.

287
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,457
You called me Didi right?

288
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,040
So that makes my brother right?

289
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,999
Give me a five, brother.

290
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,540
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

291
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,040
Please call Mrs. Bagchi.

292
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,790
Madam left for Camel street.

293
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,707
Hi. I am here to meet Agnes D'mello.

294
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,499
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes.

295
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:20,999
Your name, madam?

296
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:25,624
- Vidya Bagchi.
- Bidya Bagchi.

297
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:28,332
Nothing.

298
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,499
Bidya Bagchi.

299
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,957
Darling, I told you this
when you called me from London.

300
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:50,707
Your husband didn't come to
my company for any assignment.

301
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,040
I am the HR manager.

302
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:56,165
I approve every assignment.

303
00:25:56,666 --> 00:26:01,249
And I didn't sanction any
assignment for any Arnab Bagchi.

304
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,124
Arnab.

305
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,290
No. He didn't come here.

306
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:13,249
He did. I sent him.

307
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:14,999
“I don't want to go to Kolkata.”

308
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:17,332
“I am on a holiday.”

309
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,749
“It's just a question of
two weeks, I'll be okay.”

310
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,624
“You're crying like a girl”

311
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,374
“You are actually packing my bag.”

312
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,749
“Wifey, please. They
will find someone else.”

313
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,207
“And I will stay right
here and look after you.”

314
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,165
“Cooking, washing.”

315
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,249
“That's what I am afraid of.”

316
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,207
“I will be okay, go.”

317
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,665
Please help me Didi...

318
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:51,999
Please help me.

319
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,290
I don't know what to do.

320
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:57,582
- Yes!
- There's a police officer who wants to see you.

321
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:58,999
Me?

322
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,707
- Bye.
- Bye.

323
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,040
Poor girl.

324
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,832
Mrs. Bagchi.

325
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,082
This way.

326
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,124
Show it.

327
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,749
Let it be.

328
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,249
Mrs. Bagchi.

329
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,582
That wasn't Arnab.

330
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,665
Mrs. Bagchi, doesn't Arnab
have any relatives in Kolkata.

331
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:18,249
Uncle or anyone?

332
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:22,999
He has an uncle.

333
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,999
He stays in Thakurpukur.

334
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,624
Here Here here (in tamil)

335
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,540
Meaning?

336
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,582
Arnab's school.

337
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,165
Kalagachhia Kailash
Kamini High School.

338
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,332
- I see.
- I have heard lot of stories about it.

339
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,790
Rana. That means uncle's
house must be close-by.

340
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,332
Let's go that way.

341
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:21,165
Rana. I should've worn a sari, right?
Just hold this.

342
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,290
Sari? You wear a sari as well.

343
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,832
Do you have one?

344
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:29,082
Don't worry, Mrs. Bagchi.
You are looking nice.

345
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,374
Come.

346
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,582
- I am meeting them for the first time.
- I know...

347
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,832
- Arnab Bagchi.
- No.

348
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,957
Then, does any other
Bagchi family live around here?

349
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:41,624
Look, madam. We've been
living here for the past 30 years.

350
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,999
But we never heard of
any Bagchi family...

351
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:47,582
Or any Arnab Bagchi.

352
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,874
- Thank you.
- Who is Arnab Bagchi?

353
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,082
Thank you.

354
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,374
Can you come in, please?

355
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,999
What happened? Been punished?

356
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,082
What is this?

357
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,999
This is a flying swan.

358
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:15,082
- I see, that's a flying swan.
- Yes.

359
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,082
It looks more like a dead duck to me.

360
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,624
Okay, see you.

361
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,082
No, dear. There was no
Arnab Bagchi that year.

362
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:37,082
Why can't I access
Milan Damji's record?

363
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,707
Its showing me Restricted each time.

364
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,082
Madam, I will need Mr.
Tyagi's permission to unlock it.

365
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:42,832
Where is Tyagi?

366
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:43,999
He's on leave today.

367
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,582
Coming, mother.

368
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,999
- Hello.
- Agnes.

369
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:43,582
- Yes.
- Hi.

370
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,165
Can you meet me tomorrow?

371
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,999
- Of course.
- At 3 o'clock.

372
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,957
- Where?
- There's a restaurant at Park Street.

373
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,832
- Mocambo.
- Mocambo.

374
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,374
- See you.
- Take care.

375
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,290
Bye.

376
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,874
Bishnu.

377
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:16,582
Bishnu!

378
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,249
Coming Didi...

379
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,415
- Watch it.
- Move aside.

380
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,999
Here you go.

381
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:33,415
Radio?

382
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,124
Kalighat.

383
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,707
Just a minute.

384
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:44,749
Rana. Call from the airport.

385
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,165
- Hello.
- Better explain to that Bidya Bagchi.

386
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,999
- Yes, yes, yes.
- That Arnab or whoever...

387
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,290
Got her pregnant and ran away.
These things keep happening.

388
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:54,249
Hello?

389
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:57,874
Tell her not to waste time here in
this condition and return to London.

390
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,082
Oh, so you checked?

391
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,624
I have been thinking about
it for the past 30 years.

392
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,374
But he ran away in 2.

393
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,457
Sorry, can you say it again please.

394
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:08,499
Would you like a cup of tea, sir?

395
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,207
No, it's fine. Thank you.

396
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,165
Hi.

397
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:17,957
Mr. Das.

398
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:18,999
Good morning, madam.

399
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,040
Good afternoon, Mr. Das.

400
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,790
- Whatever you say, madam.
- Good afternoon, Rana.

401
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:23,040
Good afternoon.

402
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,874
Radio.

403
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,249
Are you going anywhere?

404
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,624
To meet Agnes.

405
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,999
I will drop you there.

406
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,249
I won't need your
chariot today, Satyoki.

407
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:34,040
My taxi is waiting.

408
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,207
Okay.

409
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,707
Mrs. Bagchi, we checked...

410
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:42,665
With Kolkata and
London's immigration departments.

411
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,040
The date that you told us...

412
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,999
No Arnab Bagchi left from London...

413
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:50,540
Or arrived in Kolkata.

414
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,999
Then surely there's a
mistake in the system.

415
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,832
We double-checked it.
Triple-checked it.

416
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,415
The facts are correct.

417
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:22,874
Yesterday after you left I
took a close look at the photo.

418
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,207
And you know what.

419
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,665
Your husband looks exactly like...

420
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,999
An ex-employee of ours.

421
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,290
Milan Damji.

422
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,332
- Who?
- Milan Damji.

423
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,999
He left 2 years ago...

424
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,540
He was a funny one.

425
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:37,999
He would keep to himself.

426
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,999
He joined suddenly
and even left suddenly.

427
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,040
His blood group was funny as well.

428
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,999
Bombay blood group.

429
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:48,540
I clearly remember the
day he left the company.

430
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,165
A lot of people came looking for him.

431
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,999
But he vanished!

432
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:53,957
Poof.

433
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:56,249
But what is the connection with Arnab?

434
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,124
Two years ago he was in London.

435
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:01,624
Milan Damji looks exactly like Arnab.

436
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,999
That's why yesterday I tried...

437
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,540
To get his photo from the computer.

438
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:08,874
But it would always
show me the same message...

439
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,790
Restricted.
Restricted. Restricted.

440
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,290
God knows how to
operate these computers!

441
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,374
Tomorrow when Tyagi returns...

442
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:16,582
Tyagi?

443
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:19,874
Tyagi here.

444
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,624
Who wants Milan Damji's records?

445
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,915
If I can't access the computer...

446
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,999
There are some employee
records are in the old office.

447
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,790
Maybe there's a photo in that.

448
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:38,999
Agnes, thank you but...

449
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,165
What will I do seeing Milan's photo?

450
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,457
Just see Milan Damji's photo once.

451
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:44,082
Then decide.

452
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,516
Bob.

453
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,540
You can't do anything.

454
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,040
The figures are so bad.

455
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,457
You can't get a single
life insurance client.

456
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:14,165
If this goes on then soon you
will be fired from this job.

457
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:17,624
For God's sake, switch off the phone...

458
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,457
And concentrate on your target.

459
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,499
Client, sir.

460
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:21,749
Disgusting.

461
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:51,874
Yes.

462
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,707
Hello.

463
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:55,999
Agnes D'Mello.

464
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,124
Yes.

465
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,082
One minute.

466
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,082
Oh she wears a wig!

467
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:47,374
Good morning, sir.

468
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,415
Sir, he's in a meeting.

469
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:53,165
Gentlemen, we've to
ensure that we do this.

470
00:38:58,041 --> 00:38:59,249
Excuse me.

471
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:06,915
I've to go to
Kolkata today, right now.

472
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:10,332
- Why?
- No smoking in the building, Khan.

473
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:13,540
- I know.
- Someone shot NDC's HR manager.

474
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,999
So.

475
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,165
That's the local
police station's case.

476
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,540
Why do you have to go
to Kolkata for that?

477
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:22,165
She was trying to
access Milan's record.

478
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,082
What other information do we have?

479
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,540
There's a pregnant lady,
from London.

480
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,332
Vidya Bagchi.

481
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,832
Listen, on the seventh day...

482
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,749
I need this room empty for a while.

483
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,165
Everyone go out.

484
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,290
What?

485
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:45,415
Didn't you hear?

486
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,082
I need this room empty.

487
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,999
Who are you?

488
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:54,332
- What is your name? Get out.
- Shut the... Khan.

489
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,540
That's my name Shut the... Khan.

490
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,665
Anything else?

491
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,999
- No, sir.
- Call Vidya Bagchi.

492
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:03,874
I want her here in 10 minutes.

493
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,457
Okay, sir.

494
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,124
Tell me.

495
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,957
I am pregnant woman, sir.

496
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,415
You shouldn't be
smoking in front of me.

497
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,040
Mrs. Bagchi, we don't
know much about each other.

498
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:23,249
So leave it to me about
what I should or shouldn't do.

499
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,790
Let's come to the point. Tell me.

500
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:27,915
How are you related to Agnes?

501
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:31,999
My husband Arnab Bagchi is missing.

502
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,165
What happened? Why
is everyone outside?

503
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,165
That Vidya Bagchi, it's a big problem.

504
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,040
- Really?
- Yes.

505
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,290
What are you saying?

506
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:43,999
Mrs. Bagchi.

507
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,707
What is going on?

508
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:47,207
- Look...
- Who are you?

509
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:48,999
- Look, I am talking to her.
- Out.

510
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,582
- But who are you?
- Out.

511
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,582
Close the door behind you.

512
00:40:58,708 --> 00:40:59,874
Out!

513
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,874
Yes, so what were you saying?

514
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:08,915
Who is he?

515
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:12,415
Arnab's face resembles an
ex-employee Milan Damji.

516
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,082
- And Agnes...
- There was never an employee called Milan there.

517
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:19,290
I feel Agnes got it wrong.

518
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:21,040
Are you sure?

519
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:23,957
Because I remember correctly...

520
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,207
That Agnes said Milan Damji.

521
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,082
Mrs. Bagchi, I know more
about NDC than you and Agnes.

522
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,999
2000 employees work there, understand.

523
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,999
I am quite sure.

524
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,249
Yes, she also said that...

525
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,999
When she tried to
access Milan Damji's record...

526
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,332
- She kept getting Restricted...
- You aren't listening to me.

527
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:49,790
Are you listening?

528
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:55,790
There was no one called Milan.

529
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:59,207
No, inspector I am
sure Agnes said Milan.

530
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:01,290
Do you understand what I am saying?

531
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,332
There's no one called Milan there.

532
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:05,040
You are still stuck on Milan.

533
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:06,665
Don't you understand what I am saying?

534
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,040
Milan. Milan. Milan.

535
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,499
Out!

536
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:15,832
Look, I...

537
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:20,040
Mrs. Bagchi. Look here.

538
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,874
I am giving you a free advice,
although I don't.

539
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:28,999
Get over with whatever you came
here to do and leave for London.

540
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:32,082
That will be best for
you in this condition.

541
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:33,457
Do you understand?

542
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:37,707
Mr. Khan.

543
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,249
We don't know each other...

544
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:46,707
So leave it to me about
what I should or shouldn't do.

545
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:50,957
And anyway, you
don't give free advices...

546
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,665
That's good.

547
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:54,582
You shouldn't either.

548
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,207
Quiet.

549
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:58,207
Sir, sorry.

550
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:01,457
Take all this inside.

551
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,582
Mrs. Bagchi, I will drop you.

552
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:05,915
Come.

553
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,582
No, no, no. No need to worry, sir.

554
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:10,082
It's a simple case.

555
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:11,915
Actually.

556
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:17,707
Agnes confused her husband with Milan.

557
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:21,540
That Vidya Bagchi.

558
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,040
Her husband got her
pregnant and disappeared.

559
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:26,457
No, no, she is completely harmless.

560
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,165
I will get her background checked.
Don't worry at all.

561
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:33,665
Don't waste time on
that pregnant woman, Khan.

562
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,082
Tell me about Milan.

563
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:45,207
Give me Captain Bajpai.

564
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:51,999
- Yes.
- For God's sake get a mobile, Bajpai.

565
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:54,040
Why? Why do I need a mobile?

566
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,957
I stay at home the entire day.

567
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:58,457
When can you come to the office?

568
00:43:58,541 --> 00:43:59,540
Why?

569
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:03,040
I needed to discuss
something important with you...

570
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:05,665
About Milan Damji.

571
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:08,582
Hello?

572
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:10,540
Bajpai?

573
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:11,790
I'm here, go on.

574
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,832
Can you come to the office?

575
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,207
No.

576
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:34,415
Rana. If I address
someone by his first name...

577
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,290
Then what does it mean?

578
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:39,249
That you know him really well.

579
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:41,957
“There's no one called Milan there.”

580
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,374
“Actually there is no Milan.”

581
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,999
“Milan. Milan. Milan.”

582
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,999
According to Khan,
Milan Damji is someone...

583
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:48,749
Who doesn't exist at all.

584
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,832
Yet, he said Milan
instead of Milan Damji.

585
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:54,207
Why?

586
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:57,124
I am going to NDC.

587
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,415
If I find out anything,
I will call you.

588
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,707
No, sir. There is no
Milan Damji in our records.

589
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,749
How long have you been working here?

590
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,540
Sir, 1 and half years.

591
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,874
And you never heard
the name of Milan Damji?

592
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,999
- No, sir.
- Sapna, do you...

593
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,582
You?

594
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:21,915
Sir, he was inquiring about
Agnes D'mello's murder case.

595
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:25,082
Do you have any authorization?

596
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,582
I am standing right behind you?

597
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,332
Whose name is Rana?

598
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,832
Sir. I am Rana.

599
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:34,582
Why did you go there?

600
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:35,999
With whose permission?

601
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:37,790
Without any permission, or a warrant.

602
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,957
To hell with the warrant,
first tell me...

603
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,874
Why do you have to
conduct a local investigation...

604
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,665
When this is an IB case?

605
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,999
Next time if I see you following up...

606
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,874
Without my permission.

607
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,665
Then you will be
telling the traffic police...

608
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,665
About the traffic from
the control room, understand.

609
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,999
- No, sir, actually...
- Did I ask you? Did I ask you?

610
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,415
Will you work for the traffic control?

611
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,082
Do you want to work
for the traffic control?

612
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:01,165
Out.

613
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,665
Who else?

614
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,540
Do you? Out.

615
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,165
What?

616
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,790
Didn't you understand what I said?

617
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:14,082
Out.

618
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,957
How long have you
been doing service?

619
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:22,457
Six months, sir.

620
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:24,040
Do you love your job?

621
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,707
Do you want to keep working?

622
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:27,999
Yes, sir.

623
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:43,457
Mrs. Bagchi, I think
Khan sir is right.

624
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:45,374
Agnes must be confused with someone.

625
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,874
- See, NDC has at least 2000 employees...
- Exactly, Rana.

626
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,915
2000 employees work in NDC...

627
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,582
So why did Agnes
take Milan Damji's name?

628
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:56,915
She wasn't wrong?

629
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:59,082
And you know, Agnes
never said anything...

630
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:01,707
Until she hadn't seen
Arnab's photo properly.

631
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:11,540
What happened?

632
00:47:11,666 --> 00:47:14,332
Why are those women
wearing such a sari?

633
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,749
- Them?
- The red and white sari.

634
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,374
They wear it on any auspicious day.

635
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:20,915
But why?

636
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:23,624
“White sari with red border?”

637
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,082
“Why should I wear that?”

638
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:26,082
“Why? Why?”

639
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,374
“It's traditional.”

640
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:28,957
“Everyone wears that on
the last day of Durga Puja.”

641
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,582
“Everyone, even men?”

642
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:36,624
“I will get you one when I
go to Kolkata, Mrs. Bagchi.”

643
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,749
“And trust me, even
you will look awesome.”

644
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:41,475
“What?”

645
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:51,499
“Mr. Vidya Bagchi, don't bore me.”

646
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:54,832
“And drop this stupid idea
of making me wear a sari.”

647
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:59,874
“Just go to Kolkata
quietly and come back quickly.”

648
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:06,832
And then I forced
him to go to Kolkata.

649
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,624
He's an idiot as well.

650
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:13,999
He came here.

651
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,624
He had this bad habit of
doing whatever I said.

652
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:35,999
I am sure you will find Arnab.

653
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:44,624
Can I say something,
if you don't mind?

654
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,999
That sari, the one
that woman was wearing.

655
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:51,874
The day you find Arnab,
you can wear that sari.

656
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,415
That will be the
auspicious day for you.

657
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:02,415
Arnab won't be found so easily.

658
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,957
I will have to look for him.

659
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:07,749
That's the point, Mrs. Bagchi.

660
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,374
How will we look for him?

661
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:12,249
Milan Damji does not exist.

662
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:15,082
He's some story that
you believe to be true.

663
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:19,457
Rana.

664
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,040
Agnes said...

665
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,874
“The employee records
are in the old office.”

666
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,415
“There might be a photo in it.”

667
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:29,665
What are you saying?

668
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,999
How can we barge
inside someone's office?

669
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,624
That too, the National Data Centre.

670
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,999
But it's closed down.

671
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:36,165
- Sapna.
- Yes, sir.

672
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,749
Do you have hard copies of
the old employees records?

673
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:40,832
No, sir. Everything's on the system.

674
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:42,582
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

675
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:43,999
Sir.

676
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:46,290
There might be some in the old office.

677
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,749
There's nothing here.

678
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,832
- Hello.
- Write down, third floor.

679
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:58,290
Third floor.

680
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:00,374
12 R.N. Mukherjee Road.

681
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:03,832
It's the old NDC office.

682
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,957
There's a file on Milan Damji...

683
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,707
Who is Milan Damji?

684
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:09,999
No one. Just do as I say.

685
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,874
- Get the file.
- Bob.

686
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,249
Client.

687
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:18,457
Good.

688
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:21,290
Let's go.

689
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,790
This one.

690
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:41,082
Oh, God. That's a big lock.
I can't do it.

691
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,957
Rana. Open it.

692
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,332
How?

693
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:47,624
Mrs. Bagchi, I am
the police not a thief.

694
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,915
Really?

695
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:50,749
Open it.

696
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:53,832
This is great.

697
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:57,415
The police is breaking and
entering himself. Very good.

698
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:30,582
There are millions of files here.

699
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:32,124
How will we find it?

700
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,165
This is not done.

701
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,374
We'll have to look
for the HR department.

702
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:43,374
I am totally screwed
myself on this one (in Bengali)

703
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:44,749
Meaning?

704
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:47,040
I will explain that later.

705
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:54,915
- What's written here?
- Same. Xerox.

706
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:04,999
This door.

707
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:09,082
Chief accounts. No, no, no.

708
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:13,290
Rana. H.R.D.

709
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:36,165
Look there.

710
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:39,790
If it exists then it
must be somewhere here...

711
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:40,832
Or it doesn't exist.

712
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:43,082
If Agnes has said it,
then it must be here.

713
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,290
DE. DH. DU.

714
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:56,999
DS. DC. DDH.

715
00:52:57,125 --> 00:52:58,999
DA.

716
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:03,165
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up. Please.

717
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,790
Just a minute, Rana.

718
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:09,582
Milan Damji.

719
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:16,957
There was no file on Milan Damji.

720
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:18,832
Milan Damji exists.

721
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:20,082
Who is Milan Damji?

722
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:26,999
Where did you get this paper from?

723
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:28,832
What difference does that make?

724
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:31,165
- Who is Milan Damji?
- Is he your husband?

725
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:32,999
Take a good look.

726
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:34,999
Is he your husband?

727
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,290
Take a look.

728
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:37,999
- No.
- He isn't.

729
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:40,999
Then what difference does
it make about who he is.

730
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:44,957
Forget Milan Damji .and I will forget
where you got this paper from.

731
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,124
End of matter.

732
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:47,999
Milan Damji isn't Arnab.

733
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:49,999
But he does look like Arnab...

734
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:53,124
And if something has
happened to my husband...

735
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:55,082
Because of that, then it is
very important for me to know...

736
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,040
Who Milan Damji is.

737
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:02,290
Either you tell me
or you leave it to me.

738
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,749
I will find the answer
and come back to you.

739
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:08,999
How will you find out?

740
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:15,665
I will go out and ask every person.

741
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,374
Even if he's a common man
on the streets, the police.

742
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,790
Or the media?

743
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:28,707
Someone will surely have
an answer to this question.

744
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,957
Sit down, Mrs. Bagchi.

745
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:34,999
Sit down.

746
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,790
Do you know anything about the attack
on Kolkata Metro two years ago?

747
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:48,040
Yes.

748
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:50,624
Milan Damji was behind that attack.

749
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:53,457
He's the prime suspect in this case.

750
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:59,249
Then why doesn't anyone
know about Milan Damji.

751
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:02,415
Milan Damji doesn't exist
for the world, that's why.

752
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:04,874
He didn't exist for me either.

753
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:07,915
Until the day I was
given the task to catch him.

754
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:10,207
But until then it was too late.

755
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:12,915
Milan disappeared and
so did all his reports.

756
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,249
- But how can anyone just disappear?
- It can be our agents.

757
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,207
Milan was a government agent.

758
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,957
He betrayed us. Joined
hands with the enemy.

759
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,249
We have been hiding
this from the people.

760
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:26,707
Not just that, there's someone
in our system who is helping Milan.

761
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,915
This is a dangerous game,
Mrs. Bagchi.

762
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,665
Those who want to keep Milan
safe are very powerful people.

763
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,374
They can do anything.

764
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,165
Hello.

765
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:57,749
Madam.

766
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,665
Madam. I am so sorry.

767
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,749
It was a mistake.

768
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:04,374
Are you alright?

769
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:06,082
I saved you today.

770
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:07,540
My reflexes.

771
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,749
What if I can't save you tomorrow?

772
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:11,415
Oh, God. One
shouldn't think like that.

773
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:14,165
You and your child should stay safe.

774
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:17,957
I will pray to God for that.

775
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,540
Madam.

776
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:22,332
Madam. Kolkata, dangerous city.

777
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:23,749
Right?

778
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:26,582
Anything can happen here at any time.

779
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:28,249
I am telling her for her own good.

780
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:29,665
Go back.

781
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:32,499
Go back, madam. Go back.

782
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:35,582
Very dangerous city, Kolkata.

783
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,040
No.

784
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,582
I don't want to come back.

785
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:46,624
You can have your bureau, your system.

786
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,374
One project.

787
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:50,165
Just one project failed.

788
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,582
That doesn't mean we
shut down the bureau?

789
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:54,665
- Shut down the system...
- Just one project.

790
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,999
How easily you can
say that, Bhaskaran?

791
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,207
- Just one project.
- You gave me this assignment, Bhaskaran.

792
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:03,374
Pick three ordinary guys, train them...

793
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,790
And turn them into
bureau's best agents.

794
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,124
And what did I do?

795
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,707
I created a monster.

796
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:11,624
I found two good people...

797
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,790
But an animal like Milan
Damji got trained as well.

798
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:17,374
And he joined hands with
those he had to save us from.

799
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:22,832
He killed the very
civilians I trained him to protect.

800
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,457
We will find Milan,
you just come back.

801
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:29,499
You cannot find Milan,
Bhaskaran, that's the point.

802
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:32,582
I trained him. You cannot find him.

803
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:35,832
Only fools like you
and me can be found...

804
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:39,874
Who keep ranting
Our system is perfect.

805
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:41,457
Law has the upper hand.

806
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:43,999
There is no
corruption in our system.

807
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:46,082
Everything is hunky-dory.

808
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,540
Bhaskaran.

809
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:53,290
One man helped Milan Damji to escape.

810
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,790
That man is still
working in your bureau...

811
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:58,040
Right under your nose.

812
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:03,165
The day you find him,
that day I will come back.

813
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:17,082
Rana, three things are possible.

814
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:18,374
One...

815
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:22,040
Arnab has left me and ran away.

816
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:25,624
Two...

817
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:28,749
Arnab and Milan Damji
are the same person.

818
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,040
And third...

819
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,290
Arnab looks just like Milan Damji...

820
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:34,915
And that's why Arnab's in trouble.

821
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,707
That must have happened.

822
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:42,874
- So you are saying that Arnab looks like him and so...
- I am sure.

823
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:45,374
We will have to find
Milan in order to find Arnab.

824
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:49,124
And the day we find Milan,
we will find Arnab.

825
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:52,082
Mrs. Bagchi, how is that possible?

826
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:53,999
Where do we start looking for someone
we don't know anything about?

827
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,457
From his house.

828
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:59,707
- Meaning?
- I mean Agnes's file had Milan Damji's home address.

829
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,040
How much further?

830
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:21,374
Ten minutes.

831
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,582
Sorry.

832
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,082
It must be somewhere around here?

833
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:52,707
Which way is Bishambar Malik Lane.

834
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:58,999
Mrs. Bagchi, this is
Bishambar Malik Lane.

835
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:01,582
Didi, where is number 9.

836
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:02,832
- This one.
- This one?

837
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:04,707
- Yes.
- This is the one. Come.

838
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,082
Number nine. Come on.

839
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:18,540
You are OK to climb up?

840
01:01:18,666 --> 01:01:19,999
Yes. Let's go.

841
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:23,999
Carefully.

842
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:25,999
I don't know which one it is.

843
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:28,124
There are no numbers.

844
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,832
Nothing's wrong.

845
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:35,040
Where is number three?

846
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:37,999
- Over there but it's locked. Anything wrong sir?
- Nothing, nothing.

847
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:40,082
Come.

848
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:43,790
Here it is.

849
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:45,207
But it's locked.

850
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:47,957
I see. Give.

851
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,582
The police is breaking
and entering himself.

852
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:56,540
You said so.

853
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,124
Wait.

854
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:17,915
I wonder why anyone
needed to lock this place.

855
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,374
There's nothing here.

856
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:22,999
And even if there was anything then
Khan must have taken it away.

857
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:24,999
Mrs. Bagchi.

858
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:27,290
- Mrs. Bagchi.
- Yes.

859
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,915
- Let's go from here.
- There's nothing here.

860
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,415
Yes, let me take a look.

861
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:42,332
Mrs. Bagchi, don't do that.

862
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:45,374
No, no, I am okay. I
will surely find something.

863
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:49,957
Let's look there.

864
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:04,124
Did you see, Rana, only flat
no.3 didn't have a letter-box?

865
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:10,582
Who is it?

866
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:13,207
Are there any letters for no.3?

867
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:15,040
There is one.

868
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,207
There in no.9.

869
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:37,540
- Just a minute.
- Poltu, come here.

870
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:40,749
Where are you? - Rana, Milan used
to order tea from here.

871
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,249
Maybe they might know something.

872
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,665
But how do you know?

873
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:48,082
You offered me tea in a
similar glass in the police station.

874
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:49,624
See what they are asking for.

875
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:52,165
- Remember, there were two similar glasses at Milan's house.
- Yes.

876
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:54,790
Now, there was no
kitchen in Milan's home, so...

877
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,165
Didi Poltu.

878
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:57,874
One minute.

879
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:01,457
Are you scared?

880
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:03,290
He is my friend.

881
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:05,040
What is your name?

882
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:08,290
- Poltu.
- Poltu? Pet name or real name?

883
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,040
Pet name. Real name is Subroto.

884
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:13,582
Subroto, no need to be scared.

885
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,124
So tell me, do you remember anything...

886
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,790
About the person in flat no.3?

887
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:21,290
- Flat no.3? No.
- Anything.

888
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,124
I mean what kind of
a person was he. Short-tempered?

889
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:28,790
Or would he smile each
time you delivered tea?

890
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,874
Would he say something?

891
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,999
No, he wouldn't say anything, but...

892
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,915
He would order only one glass of tea.

893
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,832
And sometimes a second
person would come to meet him.

894
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:42,124
That's when he would order two teas.

895
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:43,415
Yes, there was someone.

896
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,999
Who was the other person?

897
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,332
He would always carry a suitcase.

898
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:49,415
And the corners looked like gold.

899
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,082
Suitcase?

900
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:54,124
This big.

901
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:55,499
Briefcase.

902
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:01,082
Oh, you look so handsome
when you smile, Subroto.

903
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:05,499
You can win any
child's heart so easily.

904
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,082
- I am completely sure.
- What?

905
01:05:08,916 --> 01:05:10,582
That you will be a great mother.

906
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,457
What is this? Donation bills. Nonsense.

907
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,957
He said there's a
letter from the bank.

908
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,832
But this is a blood bank.

909
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,499
People's blood bank.

910
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:26,082
Bombay blood group?

911
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:30,207
Rana, Agnes had said that
Milan had a rare blood group.

912
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:31,999
“Bombay blood group.”

913
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:34,790
Sir, if any person
has a rare blood group...

914
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:37,082
Then he stores his blood with us.

915
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,915
So that if there's an emergency...

916
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,332
Then he can use his blood.

917
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:41,707
I see.

918
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:45,040
When was blood
required last in this case?

919
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:46,624
Will you check it and tell us?

920
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:49,707
- Just a wait a minute, I will tell you.
- Of course.

921
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:55,582
There was a requirement
for this rare blood group...

922
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,249
On May 2008, 25th May.

923
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:59,790
And we received a call
from Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

924
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:01,457
Ekbalpur Nursing Home?

925
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:08,999
Not a single paper.

926
01:06:09,416 --> 01:06:10,582
No records, nothing.

927
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:12,707
Must be. It's been erased.

928
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:14,207
Just like every
other records of Milan.

929
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:17,915
Mrs. Bagchi, this is a dead end.

930
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,415
Come on, Satyoki.

931
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:20,915
There must be something somewhere.

932
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,082
I am not going to accept defeat.
After making it so far.

933
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:25,415
You have always helped me.

934
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,249
I cannot go further
without your help, really.

935
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:35,582
There's a man who
may be able to help us.

936
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:37,665
He was once a police informer.

937
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:55,207
Sorry.

938
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:59,082
Come.

939
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:08,124
Careful. Careful.

940
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:12,999
Are you fine?

941
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,332
Thank you.

942
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,957
Sir, can you tell me
where is Paresh Pal...

943
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,499
Sir?

944
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:33,874
There. There.

945
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,707
Paresh.

946
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,832
No. I have no
connections with the police now.

947
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:47,082
But, Paresh, we just
need a small information.

948
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:49,915
Look, whether the
information is small or big.

949
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:51,124
I don't give it any more.

950
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:53,832
Paresh Please.

951
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:55,915
Please leave.

952
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,040
If someone sees us then
it will create a problem.

953
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:01,582
Sir...

954
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,249
I am searching for my husband.

955
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,540
I came from London in
this condition all alone.

956
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:12,457
I just need an answer for my child...

957
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:14,790
That what happened to his father.

958
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,999
I cannot force you,

959
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:22,540
but... please help us.

960
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,790
- Tell.
- Have you heard about Milan Damji?

961
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:31,207
Who?

962
01:08:31,291 --> 01:08:32,499
Milan Damji.

963
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,707
Milan Damji. No.

964
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:37,082
Two years ago, on 25th May...

965
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:40,457
Bombay blood group was
required in Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

966
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:41,957
What for?

967
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,499
We just need to find that out.

968
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:44,915
Can you do that?

969
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:55,666
Laundry Didi?

970
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:03,040
I am not Laundry Didi,
I am Bidya Didi.

971
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,624
Your transistor is giving chocolate.

972
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:11,374
- Such a big chocolate.
- So big.

973
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:13,499
Hello.

974
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:16,082
You did disturb me, I am
in an important meeting.

975
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,999
In the room with Vishnu.

976
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:21,999
Really?

977
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,832
When?

978
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,999
25th May, 2008.

979
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:35,582
Two men had a meeting here.

980
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,415
There was news about only
two people meeting until now.

981
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:45,957
But now it appears there was a
third person present as well.

982
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:50,374
And the blood was ordered
from Ekbalpur Nursing Home...

983
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:51,874
For this third person.

984
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,999
So, was that third person Milan Damji?

985
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:56,040
I don't have any more information.

986
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:57,707
Paresh...

987
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:59,040
Wait.

988
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:02,290
You will find the rest
of the information...

989
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:04,374
At Park Street Police
Station or you can find Dr. Ganguly.

990
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:07,165
That night he was on night duty.

991
01:10:13,541 --> 01:10:15,624
I remember that it was a police case...

992
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:18,082
But I don't remember
what exactly it was.

993
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:19,832
- It was two years ago.
- Ready, sir.

994
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:21,124
- Yes, I will be there.
- Okay.

995
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:24,124
- Give me a day, I will check and tell you.
- Thank you.

996
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,749
- I need to go, I have a surgery.
- Thank you.

997
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,665
- Don't worry.
- Please.

998
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,999
Thank you very much.

999
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:56,499
Yes.

1000
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,540
- Dr. Ganguly?
- Yes.

1001
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,999
Hello. Bob Biswas.

1002
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,040
- Hello.
- Just a minute.

1003
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:11,832
“I remember that it
was a police case.”

1004
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,749
Stop it Rana.

1005
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:18,040
Your computer is driving
me up the bloody wall.

1006
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,415
Mr. Chatterjee.

1007
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,707
- What?
- Hello.

1008
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:21,999
Oh my, God.

1009
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:24,165
Bidya Bagchi.
You arrived at the right time.

1010
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:26,999
- Hi, Rana.
- You had shut this computer up the other day, didn't you?

1011
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:29,624
- Yes.
- Do it today as well, please. Otherwise I will go crazy.

1012
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,082
- Thank you.
- I will go meet the senior officer.

1013
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:36,082
- Come, come.
- Oh, God.

1014
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,582
No, no, keep seated.
He can return any moment.

1015
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,457
Two people were killed at Nonakpur
Tram Depot on the 25th of May.

1016
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:47,082
One was Dinesh Rao...

1017
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:50,290
Who was a police
informer in the Metro attack case.

1018
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:51,999
And second...

1019
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:57,332
Second was Vijay Verma
who was a government agent.

1020
01:11:57,416 --> 01:11:58,999
Government agent?

1021
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:03,915
He's back, he's back.

1022
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:07,415
It's done, sir.

1023
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,040
Done, Mr. Chatterjee.

1024
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:09,999
It's done.

1025
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,832
That's nice, very good.

1026
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:13,040
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

1027
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:15,082
- Welcome.
- Okay.

1028
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:17,915
What is the matter?

1029
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:20,707
Mr. Chatterjee, may I leave?

1030
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:22,040
Yes.

1031
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:24,082
- Bye.
- Bye.

1032
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:03,124
Yes, mother.

1033
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:05,082
I am coming.

1034
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:35,290
Mrs. Bagchi, what are you doing?

1035
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:36,624
Why are you cleaning it yourself?

1036
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:37,874
Wait, I will call the staff?

1037
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:39,040
- No. No, no, no.
- Come here.

1038
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:40,915
I do the cleaning myself at home.

1039
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,749
Sit. I cannot tolerate dust.

1040
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:45,124
Pull a chair.

1041
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,915
Speak, Satyoki Sinha.

1042
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:49,540
Mrs. Bagchi, I
pursued the information...

1043
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:51,040
Acquired from the database.

1044
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:53,415
There is no mention of a
third person in the records.

1045
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:56,790
Dr. Ganguly, Milan Damji,
Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

1046
01:13:56,875 --> 01:13:58,915
No one knows anything about them.

1047
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,665
There are only
records of Vijay and Dinesh.

1048
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:03,915
Vijay Verma was
investigating the Metro attack...

1049
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,707
At ground level.

1050
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:11,040
- Really?
- That's why he met Dinesh Raut at Nonakpur Tram Depot.

1051
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:14,915
Maybe Dinesh wanted to tell Vijay...

1052
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,082
Something about Milan.

1053
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:20,790
And someone informed Milan about it.

1054
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:25,499
Milan killed both of them and
got injured in the shootout.

1055
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:29,040
But the question is
that how did Milan know...

1056
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:31,665
That Vijay is going to
receive information about him?

1057
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,415
Maybe Khan was right.

1058
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:35,957
There is someone within the system...

1059
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:37,249
Who is helping Milan.

1060
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:38,540
One more thing.

1061
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,040
- NDC is also involved in this.
- Really?

1062
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:44,082
Mrs. Bagchi, every agent
has a local, a fake identity.

1063
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:45,540
Just like Milan Damji...

1064
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:47,999
Even Vijay Verma worked for NDC.

1065
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,915
To hide his true identity.

1066
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:56,665
It must be him, take a good look.

1067
01:14:57,666 --> 01:14:59,790
No. It wasn't him.

1068
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:01,499
Now, now, take a look.

1069
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:03,415
No, Didi. That wasn't him.

1070
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:05,749
- It's not him.
- Are you sure?

1071
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:06,999
Sure.

1072
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:09,290
Come, let's take Poltu back.

1073
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:11,707
I was absolutely sure that...

1074
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:14,957
Tyagi knew that Agnes is
looking for Milan's details.

1075
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:16,624
- And Tyagi stopped you.
- Of course.

1076
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,124
- Didi.
- What?

1077
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:19,540
The suitcase.

1078
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:27,832
It was him, Didi.

1079
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,415
- Are you sure?
- Sure, it was him.

1080
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:34,457
Who was he?

1081
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:35,374
I don't know.

1082
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,040
You take Poltu home...

1083
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:40,040
- I will find out and meet you there.
- Yes.

1084
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:44,665
Good morning, sir.

1085
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,249
Good morning.

1086
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,332
Turn around. Turn around.

1087
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:39,665
- Didi?
- Yes.

1088
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:42,082
- Will you have tea?
- No.

1089
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:46,040
Listen, when Rana arrives
will you ask him to call me.

1090
01:16:46,125 --> 01:16:47,415
- The police officer?
- Yes.

1091
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,832
Okay. Yes, fine.

1092
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:50,374
Bye.

1093
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,832
- Sorry.
- Rana.

1094
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:26,040
I was waiting for you at
the tea-stall for so long...

1095
01:17:26,083 --> 01:17:28,374
- Blood!
- Oh no.

1096
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:37,082
Rana, that's him. He tried to kill me.

1097
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:39,040
Stop. Stop.

1098
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:04,540
Stop.

1099
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:07,540
Move.

1100
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,957
Stop. I am the police.

1101
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,832
- Stop.
- Stop.

1102
01:18:58,291 --> 01:18:59,624
Stop.

1103
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:19,124
Oh, God.

1104
01:19:19,208 --> 01:19:21,957
Mrs. Bagchi, Bob Biswas
was a contract killer.

1105
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:22,915
This is his phone.

1106
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,040
And I have found these
photographs in his phone.

1107
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,957
Agnes D'mello.

1108
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:29,040
Dr. Ganguly.

1109
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:31,207
And you.

1110
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:32,249
This time you survived.

1111
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:34,207
But the man who hired Bob...

1112
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:36,165
Who doesn't want
anyone to reach Milan Damji...

1113
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,374
I gave this photo to Agnes.

1114
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,040
Just a minute.

1115
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:47,249
Look.

1116
01:19:47,875 --> 01:19:50,165
I gave a copy of this photo to Agnes.

1117
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:53,415
That means whoever gave
Bob the contract is in NDC.

1118
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,624
No, no. It means you didn't
hear anything I said until now.

1119
01:19:57,791 --> 01:19:59,415
And you don't understand, Mrs. Bagchi.

1120
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,790
Your life is in danger.

1121
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:02,040
And I will have to
tell Mr. Khan about this.

1122
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:03,207
Did you find out who Mr.
Briefcase was?

1123
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:04,707
- Mrs. Bagchi.
- Who was he?

1124
01:20:05,708 --> 01:20:06,832
He is Shridhar.

1125
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,124
The head of IT department.

1126
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:09,665
Tyagi reports to him.

1127
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,082
Rana, we thought that
Tyagi is doing everything.

1128
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:21,207
But Tyagi was only
passing the information.

1129
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:23,332
We have no such evidence.

1130
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,040
Come, let's go to the police.

1131
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:26,832
And yes, that phone is evidence.

1132
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:27,957
Please give it back.

1133
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,999
Phone.

1134
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,790
Rana look.

1135
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:34,207
Bob has been sent this
message from some website.

1136
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:35,707
So?

1137
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:39,040
Once I hack this
website then I will know...

1138
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:40,415
Whose computer these
photos were sent from.

1139
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:41,457
What, you...?

1140
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:46,707
You are a hacker?

1141
01:20:46,791 --> 01:20:48,082
Only in my spare time.

1142
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:50,957
You do know that I am
the police, don't you?

1143
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,332
Yes, yes, yes.

1144
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:01,499
Sorry.

1145
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:05,707
This is the IP
address of the computer...

1146
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:07,790
From where the
photos the photos were sent.

1147
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,749
And I am completely sure...

1148
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:11,415
This is the IP address
of that Mr. Briefcase.

1149
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:12,874
And once that is confirmed...

1150
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:14,290
Then we can find Milan Damji.

1151
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:15,790
No, no, no. Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

1152
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:17,415
This matter is very serious now.

1153
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:19,290
And I still say that we
should go to the police.

1154
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,040
We don't have time, Rana.

1155
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:24,499
Mr. Briefcase will soon
find out that Bob is dead...

1156
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:26,415
And then he will try
to erase all the records.

1157
01:21:26,541 --> 01:21:27,457
No, Mrs. Bagchi, I...

1158
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:30,332
Please. We just have to
access Shridhar's computer.

1159
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:32,457
After that we will go to the police.

1160
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:34,790
Cross my heart and hope to die.

1161
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:39,332
You think death is a joke, Vidya?

1162
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:44,582
Mrs. Bagchi, I have
told you so many times...

1163
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,790
That your life is in danger.

1164
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:50,832
You even witnessed
everything with your own eyes.

1165
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:53,915
Even after that you
are joking about death.

1166
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:00,332
Maybe because, after Arnab...

1167
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,999
Life has become a joke, Rana.

1168
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,124
Shall we?

1169
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:22,207
Sapna.

1170
01:22:22,666 --> 01:22:23,665
Yes, sir.

1171
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,374
You haven't left yet, Sapna.

1172
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:27,999
Sir, the office is going to
shout for the Puja from tomorrow.

1173
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:29,915
So I was completing my work.

1174
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:34,665
It is very good to see
someone working so hard.

1175
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:40,040
One day, when I get the
time I will take you out.

1176
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:41,499
For coffee.

1177
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:42,999
I would love that, sir.

1178
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,249
Bye.

1179
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:47,832
Good evening sir.

1180
01:22:50,916 --> 01:22:52,499
I am coming, darling.

1181
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:57,124
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1182
01:22:57,916 --> 01:22:59,415
This is the visitor's entry book.

1183
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,874
- Get the employer's book.
- Sorry, sir.

1184
01:23:07,875 --> 01:23:08,957
Thank you.

1185
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:10,207
Come.

1186
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,540
It's not opening.

1187
01:23:33,583 --> 01:23:35,040
- Thank you.
- Rana please hurry.

1188
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:36,124
Thanks.

1189
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:41,040
Mrs. Bagchi, quickly do
whatever you want to do.

1190
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,832
Bob... Come on Bob,
pick up the phone.

1191
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:19,999
Bob Bob.

1192
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:23,874
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up please.

1193
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:25,040
Rana, just a minute.

1194
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:26,415
I am almost there.

1195
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:41,040
Mrs. Bagchi, what is happening?

1196
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:44,874
Sapna was right, there are
many layers of protection.

1197
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,165
It will take a little time.

1198
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:55,415
Mrs. Bagchi, why is it taking
you so long to check an IP address?

1199
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,374
Rana. Rana. IP address.

1200
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,707
It's the same IP address.

1201
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:02,999
- Mr. Briefcase. We've nailed him.
- Are you sure?

1202
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:04,999
Of course.

1203
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:06,999
Guard! Guard!

1204
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:08,374
Why are you sleeping? Get up.

1205
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:10,249
- Yes.
- Was someone here with Sapna madam?

1206
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:12,874
A man and a woman.

1207
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:15,249
Oh no. Close all doors.

1208
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:16,790
Don't let anyone go out.

1209
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:17,874
Yes, sir.

1210
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:31,082
Did anyone come down?

1211
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:32,249
No, sir.

1212
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:36,832
Where did they go? Where can they...

1213
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:38,499
Hey.

1214
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:41,874
The back entrance, where
people go to smoke is it open?

1215
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:43,165
Yes, sir.

1216
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,582
Come.

1217
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:51,040
We came out at the right time.

1218
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:31,749
Oh no.

1219
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:34,249
Mrs. Bagchi, come quickly.

1220
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:39,832
Hello.

1221
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:41,374
Sir we came out from the back entrance...
Shridhar is following us.

1222
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,207
What happened? Who are you calling?

1223
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:44,624
Yes.

1224
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:46,415
Please come quickly, sir.
We need help.

1225
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,832
What happened?

1226
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:49,165
I had to call Khan sir.

1227
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:50,249
Khan?

1228
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:52,999
Sorry. Shridhar is right behind us.
Maybe he knows.

1229
01:27:01,625 --> 01:27:02,957
Come.

1230
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:07,790
What did you take from my computer?

1231
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:20,415
Gun.

1232
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:22,249
Where is my gun?

1233
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:35,082
Come. Let's go, Mrs. Bagchi.

1234
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,165
Rana, bag.

1235
01:27:39,625 --> 01:27:41,874
- Stop it.
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

1236
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,749
We want this man alive.

1237
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,499
No, no, no. This man can't die.

1238
01:27:55,708 --> 01:27:58,374
Oh no. We wanted this man alive.

1239
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:00,749
Why didn't you call me earlier?

1240
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:02,665
How will we catch Milan now?

1241
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:09,832
How will we catch Milan without him?

1242
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:13,374
Take him to the hospital.

1243
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,124
Rana works for me.

1244
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:22,165
Mrs. Bagchi, do you
remember what I said.

1245
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:25,165
We've been looking for
Milan for the past two years.

1246
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,582
And we had this last
option to find him.

1247
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:33,749
You. You could do what we couldn't.

1248
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:36,165
But you ruined the entire plan.

1249
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:41,499
Actually, Mrs. Bagchi, there's
someone in the organization...

1250
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:43,874
Who is helping Milan.

1251
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:47,540
Mr. Khan couldn't
reopen the case himself.

1252
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:50,957
So he asked for my help.

1253
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:54,915
So that we can
find Milan through you.

1254
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,040
“Do you love your job?”

1255
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:57,249
“Yes, sir.”

1256
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:58,874
“From today you will work for me.”

1257
01:29:02,666 --> 01:29:03,999
Why me?

1258
01:29:04,041 --> 01:29:06,540
Because no one's
scared of a pregnant woman.

1259
01:29:06,666 --> 01:29:08,332
Especially one whose
husband has run away.

1260
01:29:08,541 --> 01:29:09,999
No one would've doubted.

1261
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:14,290
But, Mrs. Bagchi,
only because of you...

1262
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:19,040
We could find out that Milan is
responsible for Vijay's death too.

1263
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:23,582
And we could reach Shridhar
only because of you, Mrs. Bagchi.

1264
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:28,165
You were using me.

1265
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:29,499
Yes.

1266
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:34,874
Your case was revived
only because of me...

1267
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:38,582
Because Arnab looks just like Milan.

1268
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:39,832
But we don't have time for...

1269
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:41,082
And Agnes?

1270
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:43,874
- Dr. Ganguly?
- Collateral damage.

1271
01:29:44,333 --> 01:29:45,957
One needs to make small
sacrifices in big battles...

1272
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:47,124
What's the big deal?

1273
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:49,207
And me? My child?

1274
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:52,165
Nothing would've happened to you.

1275
01:29:52,833 --> 01:29:54,249
I wouldn't have allowed it.

1276
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:56,915
I took up this
assignment only because of you.

1277
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:06,707
Mrs. Bagchi, we wanted Shridhar alive.

1278
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:08,332
He was the only one
who could've lead us...

1279
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:10,874
To the man who is helping
Milan from within the system.

1280
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:12,540
Listen to me carefully.

1281
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:14,082
We have one last option.

1282
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,374
You have hacked Shridhar's computer.

1283
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:19,499
Do it again. We might find a clue.

1284
01:30:19,833 --> 01:30:21,499
Why should I help you?

1285
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:24,957
I am not asking for
your help, Mrs. Bagchi.

1286
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,082
I am telling you.

1287
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:28,582
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

1288
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,540
Bishnu!

1289
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:38,040
Mr. Khan.

1290
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:47,124
This is the only code
that I don't understand.

1291
01:33:47,791 --> 01:33:49,040
Rest of the computer is clean.

1292
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:51,665
CXWWEDFXZS.

1293
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:52,874
Is that all you found?

1294
01:34:18,291 --> 01:34:20,874
Rana. Any idea?

1295
01:34:21,958 --> 01:34:23,999
No. I don't know.

1296
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:27,790
What can it be?

1297
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:35,040
Give me your phone, sir.

1298
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:37,125
CXWWEDFXZS.

1299
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:46,957
Sir, I feel this is a mobile number.

1300
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:52,207
This is Bhaskaran's number.

1301
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,332
What the...

1302
01:34:57,583 --> 01:35:00,374
Mrs. Bagchi. You will have
to do one last thing for me.

1303
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:02,040
Mrs. Bagchi.

1304
01:35:04,333 --> 01:35:05,665
Are you listening?

1305
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,124
Mrs. Bagchi.

1306
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:12,249
Call Bhaskaran.

1307
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:14,207
And lie to him that...

1308
01:35:14,291 --> 01:35:16,540
You found some data about
him on Shridhar's computer?

1309
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:18,582
Why should I do that?

1310
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:20,957
Because Bhaskaran
is our last chance...

1311
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:23,082
To find Arnab and Milan.

1312
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:32,540
Mrs. Bagchi.

1313
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:37,415
I have always been rude with you...

1314
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:42,332
This time it's a request, so...

1315
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:48,415
Please help me.

1316
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:55,290
Mr. Bhaskaran.

1317
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:56,540
Yes.

1318
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:57,582
Who is this?

1319
01:35:57,708 --> 01:35:59,415
This is Vidya Bagchi speaking.

1320
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:01,040
Where did you get my number from?

1321
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:03,040
From Shriddhar's computer.

1322
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:06,457
- I have found some more papers in your name.
- So?

1323
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:11,040
Look, I don't care about
who you are or what you do.

1324
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:13,082
I will return all your papers...

1325
01:36:13,166 --> 01:36:17,999
In return I want the government
to help me find my husband.

1326
01:36:18,041 --> 01:36:20,915
Look, I don't know
why you are calling me.

1327
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,665
I will inform my local office.

1328
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:25,165
They will contact you.

1329
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:36,874
Now?

1330
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:46,540
If you want to see
your husband alive...

1331
01:36:46,666 --> 01:36:47,999
Then wait for my call.

1332
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:54,999
Milan Damji.

1333
01:36:59,041 --> 01:37:02,165
Yes, I need a big brown envelope.

1334
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:05,040
Okay.

1335
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:14,624
Hello.

1336
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,832
How are you?

1337
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:31,707
Fine.

1338
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:37,165
I had to make a promise.

1339
01:37:38,166 --> 01:37:39,582
But before that...

1340
01:37:42,833 --> 01:37:44,082
This is for you.

1341
01:37:44,666 --> 01:37:46,665
Today's the last day of the Puja.

1342
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:55,457
I cannot take this.

1343
01:37:55,541 --> 01:37:56,999
No, no, no, Mrs. Bagchi, this...

1344
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:00,874
I still have the receipt.

1345
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,957
I wanted to promise you that...

1346
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,874
I will help you in finding Arnab.

1347
01:38:07,791 --> 01:38:11,415
And when we find him, I will
make him pay for this sari.

1348
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:17,165
This is from Arnab, not me.

1349
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:22,290
I am sorry, Mrs. Bagchi.

1350
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:24,249
I am really very sorry.

1351
01:38:34,791 --> 01:38:36,040
Thank you.

1352
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,540
Sorry.

1353
01:38:44,833 --> 01:38:46,165
Paresh Pal.

1354
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:47,957
Yes, Paresh.

1355
01:38:48,041 --> 01:38:50,165
You were asking about
Milan Damji, weren't you?

1356
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:51,707
Yes, did you find out anything?

1357
01:38:51,833 --> 01:38:54,082
The news is that he
has returned to Kolkata.

1358
01:38:54,375 --> 01:38:57,207
Wow. Then Khan
sir's plan is working.

1359
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,040
Only Milan can come see Vidya.

1360
01:39:00,125 --> 01:39:02,999
- Bhaskaran doesn't have any other option.
- Vidya?

1361
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:04,415
Yes.

1362
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,582
As soon as Milan comes to
see her, he will be caught.

1363
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:09,874
You want to sacrifice a helpless girl?

1364
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:11,915
No, no, no, this isn't my plan.

1365
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,207
This is Khan sir's plan.

1366
01:39:13,458 --> 01:39:15,207
And Mrs. Bagchi...

1367
01:39:18,041 --> 01:39:19,957
- Move.
- Call him up.

1368
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:21,582
Sir, sir. Sir, I am sorry.

1369
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:22,665
Just a minute.

1370
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:24,957
- We will have to stop this operation at any cost, sir.
- Yes.

1371
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,915
If Milan meets Mrs. Bagchi,
then her life is in danger.

1372
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,582
- So?
- You don't understand, sir.

1373
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:31,290
Milan never leaves
behind any eye-witness.

1374
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:32,999
He will do the same
this time as well.

1375
01:39:33,541 --> 01:39:36,332
So, we will try to
save your Mrs. Bagchi.

1376
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:39,540
You know, sir.

1377
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:41,040
You know, yet you are...

1378
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:42,374
Sacrificing her.

1379
01:39:42,708 --> 01:39:43,999
This is wrong.

1380
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:45,540
- You are intentionally.
- Shut up.

1381
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:47,415
You want to teach
me right and wrong.

1382
01:39:47,541 --> 01:39:49,082
My job is to protect the country...

1383
01:39:49,166 --> 01:39:51,332
And anything I do for that is right.

1384
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:55,582
If I have to sacrifice Vidya
Bagchi to catch Milan Damji...

1385
01:39:55,666 --> 01:39:56,540
Then that's right too.

1386
01:39:56,666 --> 01:39:58,749
Then what is the difference
between us and Milan, sir?

1387
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:00,040
There's no difference.

1388
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:03,540
We do it for the law and
he does it against the law.

1389
01:40:03,833 --> 01:40:05,874
That's why we are
right and he's wrong.

1390
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:09,999
Love is a good thing, Rana.

1391
01:40:10,041 --> 01:40:11,915
But learn to use it
at the right place.

1392
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:13,499
Meaning?

1393
01:40:13,625 --> 01:40:18,415
Your love that's telling you Go
tell Vidya Bagchi about Khan.

1394
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:19,957
That's wrong.

1395
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:21,957
This way you can save only one life...

1396
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,082
But what about thousands of
lives that Milan will take?

1397
01:40:25,916 --> 01:40:27,707
I wasn't going to tell her, sir, but...

1398
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:29,540
Rajveer, take his mobile.

1399
01:40:29,833 --> 01:40:31,082
Don't let him go anywhere.

1400
01:40:31,166 --> 01:40:32,582
Not even to the bathroom.

1401
01:40:35,416 --> 01:40:37,165
No, sir. Nothing important.

1402
01:40:37,708 --> 01:40:39,457
Yes, so what were you saying?

1403
01:41:41,583 --> 01:41:45,040
Bidya didi.

1404
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,207
Didi.

1405
01:42:26,041 --> 01:42:27,915
- You are Sharma, aren't you?
- Yes, why?

1406
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,749
- Khan sir is calling you.
- Where?

1407
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,415
In the AC... OC chamber.

1408
01:42:32,708 --> 01:42:33,915
You go.

1409
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,457
And he has asked me to sit here.

1410
01:42:36,916 --> 01:42:38,082
I will keep a watch on him.

1411
01:42:43,791 --> 01:42:45,374
Rana. Go.

1412
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,040
Go, go.

1413
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:49,374
- What about you?
- I will handle it here. Go.

1414
01:42:49,458 --> 01:42:50,749
Thank you, Chatterjee.

1415
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:55,332
- Rana.
- Yes.

1416
01:42:55,458 --> 01:42:57,207
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

1417
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:09,499
Hello.

1418
01:43:13,666 --> 01:43:14,999
Triangular Park.

1419
01:43:18,375 --> 01:43:19,332
Hello.

1420
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:21,207
Triangular Park. Triangular Park.

1421
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:22,457
Get lost.

1422
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,249
Sir, where is Rana?

1423
01:43:24,375 --> 01:43:25,707
To hell with him. Come on.

1424
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:27,999
Rajveer, follow us.

1425
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:29,040
Come on, hurry up.

1426
01:43:29,083 --> 01:43:30,374
Come on, come on, hurry up.

1427
01:43:36,541 --> 01:43:37,582
Where is Mrs. Bagchi?

1428
01:43:37,708 --> 01:43:38,915
She paid her dues and left.

1429
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,165
- Where did she go?
- Didi went to Triangular Park.

1430
01:45:06,958 --> 01:45:08,332
Mrs. Bagchi.

1431
01:46:15,541 --> 01:46:17,624
Take a left from here, Mrs. Bagchi.

1432
01:46:44,458 --> 01:46:45,749
Mrs. Bagchi.

1433
01:46:47,958 --> 01:46:49,165
Where are the files?

1434
01:46:49,583 --> 01:46:50,915
Who are you?

1435
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:53,040
What difference does it make?

1436
01:46:54,125 --> 01:46:55,290
Files.

1437
01:46:56,583 --> 01:46:57,957
Milan Damji...

1438
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:01,457
Who was just a story until now.

1439
01:47:01,583 --> 01:47:03,207
I have very little time, Mrs. Bagchi.

1440
01:47:04,041 --> 01:47:07,374
If you want your husband back Files.

1441
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:10,082
If I return the papers then...

1442
01:47:10,541 --> 01:47:12,040
Will you return me my husband?

1443
01:47:12,083 --> 01:47:13,749
Yes. Files.

1444
01:47:18,625 --> 01:47:20,040
Can you return him?

1445
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:23,040
Think about it.

1446
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:40,999
Who are you?

1447
01:49:41,958 --> 01:49:43,249
What difference does it make?

1448
01:49:56,833 --> 01:49:59,457
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

1449
01:50:10,041 --> 01:50:11,332
Catch her.

1450
01:50:11,791 --> 01:50:13,207
Check him. Check him.

1451
01:50:14,625 --> 01:50:16,457
Catch her. She's
wearing a white sari.

1452
01:50:18,083 --> 01:50:19,332
I said she's wearing a white sari.

1453
01:50:19,458 --> 01:50:20,707
Are you blind?

1454
01:51:20,041 --> 01:51:21,540
Who was Mrs. Bagchi?

1455
01:51:21,666 --> 01:51:23,749
Vidya Bagchi was a story, sir?

1456
01:51:23,833 --> 01:51:25,082
Meaning?

1457
01:51:26,791 --> 01:51:28,999
- Where is Mrs. Bagchi?
- 'Didi went to Triangular Park.”

1458
01:51:29,041 --> 01:51:30,290
“Triangular Park.”

1459
01:51:37,041 --> 01:51:38,999
“This is a flying swan.”

1460
01:51:40,958 --> 01:51:42,040
“Where did you find this uniform?”

1461
01:51:42,125 --> 01:51:44,540
“This? It's my school uniform.”

1462
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:46,874
“Back when I lived in Thakurpukur.”

1463
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,332
“Any uncle. Anyone.”

1464
01:51:50,125 --> 01:51:52,582
“He has an uncle, who
lives in Thakurpukur.”

1465
01:51:52,708 --> 01:51:53,999
“Did you ever tell
Didi Vidya about this?”

1466
01:51:54,125 --> 01:51:56,207
“Yes, when we met for the first time.”

1467
01:51:56,333 --> 01:51:58,957
“I have heard many stories about it.”

1468
01:52:03,583 --> 01:52:05,665
Check her hotel room
and her finger prints.

1469
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:06,999
It's of no use, sir.

1470
01:52:07,041 --> 01:52:08,499
“Why are you cleaning it yourself?”.

1471
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:13,290
- What?
- 'Just one sign and then you can leave.”

1472
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:14,915
“Sign here.”

1473
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:15,999
“Here.”

1474
01:52:16,041 --> 01:52:18,082
And her husband, Arnab?

1475
01:52:18,166 --> 01:52:20,207
Oh, so you haven't
understood yet, sir.

1476
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:23,207
- What?
- 'In the beginning, you told her a story.”

1477
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:25,082
“There is no one called Milan.”

1478
01:52:25,166 --> 01:52:26,124
Yes, so?

1479
01:52:26,208 --> 01:52:27,999
And she told us a story.

1480
01:52:28,041 --> 01:52:29,124
“My husband is missing.”

1481
01:52:29,208 --> 01:52:30,999
“Arnab Bagchi didn't stay here.”

1482
01:52:31,041 --> 01:52:31,957
“No, dear.”

1483
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,874
“He didn't leave
London or land in Kolkata.”

1484
01:52:33,958 --> 01:52:35,165
Milan was for real, sir.

1485
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:38,749
But there is no
Vidya Bagchi nor Arnab...

1486
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:41,249
Who looks like Milan. - 'Arnab didn't
like to get his picture taken.”

1487
01:52:41,375 --> 01:52:43,082
“Until Agnes didn't see
Arnab's photo properly.”

1488
01:52:43,166 --> 01:52:46,749
“And the day we find Milan,
we will find Arnab.”

1489
01:52:47,125 --> 01:52:49,040
What the...

1490
01:52:50,666 --> 01:52:52,749
- That means until now...
- Correct.

1491
01:52:52,875 --> 01:52:54,457
She kept using us.

1492
01:52:55,291 --> 01:52:58,040
Sir, it seems like
Vidya Bagchi was hired...

1493
01:52:58,083 --> 01:53:00,040
To find and kill Milan Damji.

1494
01:53:00,125 --> 01:53:03,082
And she used us to find Milan.

1495
01:53:03,166 --> 01:53:05,915
She wanted us to use
her as a scapegoat...

1496
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,874
To find Milan Damji.

1497
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,040
And before we could arrest Shridhar.

1498
01:53:10,125 --> 01:53:11,665
Vidya killed him as well.

1499
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:15,290
Sir, you gave Bhaskaran
and Milan to her yourself.

1500
01:53:15,416 --> 01:53:16,249
She knew.

1501
01:53:16,333 --> 01:53:18,999
“No one doubts a pregnant woman.”

1502
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:28,790
“What did you take from my computer?”.

1503
01:53:31,791 --> 01:53:33,457
Who is Satyoki?

1504
01:53:33,875 --> 01:53:35,540
“Arjun's charioteer.”

1505
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:41,040
That's me, sir.

1506
01:53:41,083 --> 01:53:42,582
My name is Satyoki.

1507
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:45,999
But who sent her?

1508
01:53:46,166 --> 01:53:47,915
And why did she help us?

1509
01:54:38,708 --> 01:54:40,040
“Arup.”

1510
01:54:44,291 --> 01:54:47,290
“Sorry, we couldn't
save your child.'

1511
01:54:56,083 --> 01:54:59,957
“Arup took up this assignment
only because I forced him to.”

1512
01:55:02,708 --> 01:55:05,165
“It's completely my fault.”

1513
01:55:26,208 --> 01:55:28,332
Arup must be really
happy today, Vidya.

1514
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:32,249
He must be proud of you.

1515
01:55:34,458 --> 01:55:36,957
Because today you have accomplished...

1516
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,832
What we all couldn't.

1517
01:55:41,958 --> 01:55:44,082
You want to know a
strange thing, Colonel.

1518
01:55:45,458 --> 01:55:46,999
In the last few days...

1519
01:55:47,791 --> 01:55:50,040
I completely forgot
that I am not pregnant.

1520
01:55:52,041 --> 01:55:53,915
It felt like...

1521
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,499
My child is still alive inside me.

1522
01:56:01,083 --> 01:56:02,874
It felt like...

1523
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:05,749
I might find Arup as well.

1524
01:56:10,666 --> 01:56:13,707
I cannot live without them, Colonel.

1525
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:16,707
I want my Arup back.

1526
01:56:18,291 --> 01:56:21,999
I want my child back.

1527
01:56:33,958 --> 01:56:36,249
“Today, two years later.”

1528
01:56:37,375 --> 01:56:40,082
“The family of those
killed in the Metro attack...”

1529
01:56:40,833 --> 01:56:43,290
“...have finally got an answer.”

1530
01:56:49,833 --> 01:56:52,249
“Sometimes even
God's make mistakes.”

1531
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:55,249
“Gods created demons.”

1532
01:56:55,375 --> 01:56:57,040
“Bestowed them with power.”

1533
01:56:57,750 --> 01:57:00,832
“But when they started
abusing that power...

1534
01:57:01,666 --> 01:57:04,040
Gods created Mother Durga.”

1535
01:57:05,125 --> 01:57:07,374
“To destroy the demons.”

1536
01:57:10,666 --> 01:57:13,665
“It's said that Goddess Durga...

1537
01:57:14,083 --> 01:57:15,999
Was created by gathering
the strength of all the mothers”

1538
01:57:17,041 --> 01:57:18,999
“Every year the Mother
graces us with her presence.”

1539
01:57:19,708 --> 01:57:21,332
“Eliminates evil.”

1540
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:24,040
“And goes back.”

1541
01:57:33,666 --> 01:57:37,332
“So that all of us can live
happily and peacefully...

1542
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,040
“...Without any fear.”
