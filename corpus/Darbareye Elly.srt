12
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,589
That was fun, wasn't it?

13
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,228
Yes, but I need to pee.

14
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,788
Did you have to get so excited?

15
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,909
Stop, so I can take her to the loo.

16
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:45,706
This isn't preschool.
Stop bothering Elly.

17
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,386
It's fine.
I'm just taking her to the loo.

18
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:52,546
Shall I take this?

19
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:54,944
- You hadn't told them?
- What?

20
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:55,944
That she was coming.

21
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:58,025
I wasn't sure until last night.

22
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,305
She's no bother to anyone.

23
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:02,145
- You Ok?
- Yes. Thanks.

24
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:03,824
She looks sweet.

25
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,985
She is. Wait and see:
They'll all love her.

26
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:07,464
Let me do that.

27
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,705
No, please. I'm used to it.

28
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:11,744
Peyman!

29
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:14,343
You drive too fast.

30
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:16,543
- You're too slow!
- It's dangerous.

31
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,463
Amir, is something going on?

32
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,463
- What?
- As if you didn't know!

33
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,143
I have no clue.

34
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:25,022
Sepideh hasn't told you
why she brought the girl?

35
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:25,982
Not at all.

36
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:35,582
You must promise not to mention it
when she's around.

37
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,301
But seriously, Ahmad,
she's a nice girl.

38
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,662
You really mean it?

39
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:41,263
Yes. She'd sort you out.

40
00:03:41,942 --> 00:03:43,382
You saw all that at a glance?

41
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:46,342
Of course.
It shows immediately.

42
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:47,821
Right, Nazy?

43
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:48,902
She's easygoing.

44
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:51,102
Already 3 votes.

45
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:53,861
I only said she was easygoing.

46
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:57,660
To know her is to love her.

47
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:59,821
Let him make up his own mind.

48
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:03,420
Can you find a good match
for me too?

49
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:05,900
Can you give him a slap for me?

50
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,219
Manuchehr!

51
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,979
Did you see that, Ahmad?

52
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,019
You deserved it!

53
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,699
That's what he's here for.

54
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,780
Oh, so that's how it is?

55
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,259
Sepideh, does the girl know
Ahmad was married once?

56
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,819
I don't know.

57
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,500
And forced to divorce?

58
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,458
I'll tell on you.

59
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:27,418
Peyman, don't!

60
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,579
What's her name again?

61
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,097
Elly.

62
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:31,897
Peyman...

63
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:32,458
Elly!

64
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:33,978
Stop it!

65
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:36,298
You'll embarrass her!

66
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:45,178
Here's the samovar.

67
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:48,616
I haven't had tea like this for ages!
Poor me!

68
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:51,456
How can you stand
living in Germany?

69
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,177
Stand it?
I'm going insane!

70
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:56,217
No wonder
your German wife left you.

71
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,337
She went to the judge and said:

72
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:00,696
"<i>Achtung!</i> The man is insane!"

73
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:01,896
Peyman!

74
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:03,176
Isn't it true?

75
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,736
Amir, would you help me?

76
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:06,696
I'm going.

77
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:12,256
What?

78
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:14,616
I didn't call you...

79
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:17,214
- Anything wrong?
- Not at all.

80
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:20,375
They joke all the time.
Don't take it personally.

81
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,335
Is that it?

82
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,933
Try to get on with them.
You'll spend a nice couple of days.

83
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,574
- Couple of days?
- Sure!

84
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:58,452
Madam...

85
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,532
See, it was right here!

86
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:07,291
Good thing I was wrong for once...

87
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:10,291
Hello. Can we have
the keys to the villa?

88
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:13,970
- The one in the woods?
- The same as last year.

89
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:15,090
Bahri?

90
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,011
So, you were all together?

91
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:18,970
Yes, at university.

92
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:20,530
My sister Nazy.
Here's Elly.

93
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:21,890
We've already been introduced!

94
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:23,570
Oh, have you...

95
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,490
- Is it here?
- Just the keys.

96
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,489
Take them to the villa.

97
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,009
We know the way.
Just give us the keys.

98
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,250
How are you?

99
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,688
Fine, thank you.

100
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,889
Don't forget, tomorrow.

101
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,848
- What?
- To leave early.

102
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,489
The owner comes
in the evening.

103
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:45,608
We'll have to clean up before.

104
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:47,288
We meant to stay 3 days.

105
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:48,689
I spoke to someone on the phone.

106
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,168
It was me.

107
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:53,967
- Can't we find an arrangement?
- I don't mind.

108
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:55,287
But the owner's coming.

109
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:57,287
Didn't you tell him we were staying?

110
00:06:57,288 --> 00:06:59,688
We told you over the phone.

111
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:02,606
Didn't you say it was all set?

112
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:06,726
There was nothing left.
I thought once here, we'd manage.

113
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,806
Manage at the height of season?

114
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,486
I'm so sorry.

115
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:12,687
It's not your fault.

116
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:14,607
Why didn't you tell me?

117
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:17,527
We wouldn't have come at all!

118
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:22,365
Don't get so upset.

119
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:24,526
We'll find another place.

120
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:28,006
Over the phone you didn't sound
sure about the owner.

121
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,325
I was sure.

122
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,844
Can't you do anything?

123
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:31,926
Like what?

124
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:35,724
If it was just us,
we'd sleep in our cars or in tents.

125
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:39,605
But we have guests, newlyweds.

126
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:41,324
Congratulations.

127
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:45,325
The groom is here from Germany.
It's like their honeymoon.

128
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,163
What about the Mahmudi villa?

129
00:07:47,164 --> 00:07:48,683
It's taken.

130
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:50,124
We can go anywhere.

131
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:52,723
- And the seafront villa?
- Sadeghian's?

132
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:55,883
With no proper doors and windows,
you'll catch cold.

133
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:56,843
It's dirty.

134
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,643
We can clean it.
Let's see it.

135
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,242
Get the keys at your uncle's.

136
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:01,524
Thank you.

137
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:21,361
What a beautiful sea!

138
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:23,082
"How happy we will be..."

139
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:25,242
Arash.

140
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,721
Are you sure this is the right key?

141
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,680
Mind your fingers.
There we go!

142
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:43,400
Never mind, Ahmad, it's open.

143
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:45,600
How did you get in there?

144
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,640
Be careful, sweetie.

145
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:12,758
It's dirty.

146
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:20,917
What's that?

147
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:22,598
Careful.

148
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:25,878
It's huge!

149
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:29,717
Watch your feet.

150
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:35,597
The fan works.

151
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:40,996
Where's the loo?

152
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:44,835
There's no lock.

153
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:46,236
Can you keep a look-out?

154
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:51,396
If you use the loo,
we'll have to keep the villa!

155
00:09:52,995 --> 00:09:54,035
You idiot!

156
00:09:57,275 --> 00:10:00,554
We'll spend the weekend cleaning.
Watch out!

157
00:10:00,555 --> 00:10:01,514
Don't worry.

158
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:06,273
Hey, boy!
Are there any gas cylinders here?

159
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:09,914
- With a vacuum, it'd be fast.
- You go and sit down.

160
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:13,793
It'll get cold here at night.

161
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:16,034
All we need is to cover the windows.

162
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:17,954
Come on, you're not alone here.

163
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:21,313
I have a suggestion.

164
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:24,512
- Tonight...
- It's fine here. Let's stay...

165
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:26,353
Can I just finish my sentence?

166
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:29,033
Go on.

167
00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:33,151
We go to the other villa tonight
and come back tomorrow.

168
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:35,872
Who wants to drag everything
back and forth?

169
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:42,511
There's no privacy in the loo
but it works!

170
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:44,231
Excellent point!

171
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,190
It's nice here.

172
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,191
It's beautiful.

173
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,391
Are we going to discuss this
for 3 days?

174
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,871
- What shall we do?
- Vote.

175
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:59,271
Elly, what do you say?

176
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,030
I'll clean up.

177
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:02,551
What about you, Shohreh?

178
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,030
We should try
and find something better.

179
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,549
One against.
And you, Nazy?

180
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,709
Whatever my man says.

181
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:11,388
So, her man?

182
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,509
Let's stay.

183
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,349
And you, Peyman?

184
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,509
My man said no, it's no...

185
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,829
You donkey!

186
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:19,468
Two against.

187
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:21,828
Two to five, we're staying!

188
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:23,549
I guess my vote doesn't count...

189
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:26,028
Oh yes, it does!
Come on!

190
00:11:44,147 --> 00:11:46,827
- Where are you going?
- Getting a broom.

191
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,585
Shall we go for the luggage?

192
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:59,346
Let's tidy up first.

193
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:01,506
We won't feel like it later.

194
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:03,065
Sepideh...

195
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:05,145
Where are the car keys?

196
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:22,304
- What's your name, boy?
- Omid.

197
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:24,744
Omid, are there any shops around?

198
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:27,104
- What do you need?
- Cigarettes.

199
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:33,343
I'll do it.

200
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:35,944
Thank you.
Leave it. I'll take it.

201
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:37,102
Arash!

202
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:39,104
Come in, you'll get wet.

203
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:41,463
Peyman, call the little one.

204
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:46,261
I'm going to stress out all weekend.

205
00:12:46,262 --> 00:12:48,262
Relax.
We all chose this place.

206
00:12:48,263 --> 00:12:52,421
I can't keep everyone away
from the sea for our son's sake.

207
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:54,902
Come on, sweetie.

208
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:58,342
Peyman, see if you
can find the boiler.

209
00:12:58,662 --> 00:12:59,862
Isn't it inside?

210
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:02,422
That's all we needed...

211
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:08,182
Sweetheart!

212
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,860
Yes? What is it?

213
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,100
Matches!

214
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:41,779
Got any?

215
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:42,898
Sorry!

216
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,779
- You scared me!
- I'm sorry!

217
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:46,579
I'll throw it away.

218
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:50,578
- Will it go through?
- Sure.

219
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:52,978
Hold it up.

220
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:56,698
- It won't fit. Wait.
- No, it won't open.

221
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:58,416
No way.

222
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,657
No! Watch out!

223
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:02,577
Tilt it a bit.

224
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:07,457
You see, it went through!

225
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,776
Shall I help you?

226
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:13,457
You'll cut yourself!

227
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:17,696
Be careful not to cut yourself.

228
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:21,415
I'm here, Morvarid.

229
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:27,016
Sepideh!

230
00:14:28,055 --> 00:14:29,335
Who's sleeping where?

231
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,974
Anywhere. Who cares?

232
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:35,214
The women in the bedrooms.
The men in the living room.

233
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:36,974
I won't sleep away from my wife.

234
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,573
Then you two in the living room.

235
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:40,335
- Shohreh?
- Yes?

236
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:41,933
Coming.

237
00:14:42,294 --> 00:14:44,733
We'll have a crazy night!

238
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:46,374
We'll have to dance to warm up.

239
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:48,453
What if I can't dance?

240
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,934
We'll teach you.

241
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:36,490
Go! Follow her!

242
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,050
- What should I do?
- Follow her.

243
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,409
Don't miss such an opportunity!

244
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,650
It's embarrassing!

245
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,529
Okay. I'll go!

246
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:30,287
Arash!

247
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,086
Get out of the water!

248
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,205
He's in the kitchen.

249
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:37,766
Here, your cigarettes.

250
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:40,006
Come on! Hurry up!

251
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:41,605
Go and get him.

252
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:44,526
Hurry UP!

253
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,205
You're soaked!

254
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,125
Look at yourself!

255
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:54,405
Elly!

256
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:58,604
- Looking for the lady?
- Yes.

257
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:00,164
She went to make a phone call.

258
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:02,084
There's no signal here.

259
00:17:03,124 --> 00:17:05,764
Stop screaming. Run, now!

260
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:09,604
Can you go
and buy some light bulbs?

261
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:14,563
Ahmad, go and find her.

262
00:17:14,884 --> 00:17:16,962
Elly's gone to make a phone call.

263
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:19,202
Take her for a ride.

264
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:21,242
Leave the poor girl alone.

265
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:22,841
The water's still cold.

266
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,041
I turned on the boiler.
We must wait.

267
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,681
You don't have much time.

268
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:27,682
Come on...

269
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:32,441
What are looking for?

270
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:36,561
Ahmad wants to go shopping.
He can fill the car up, too.

271
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,002
Here, the keys.

272
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:42,441
I'll leave tomorrow afternoon.

273
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:44,881
I'll be home by midnight.

274
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:48,080
Yes, by bus.

275
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,721
Don't worry.
My colleague will be with me.

276
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,880
She's fine.

277
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:59,200
Mom, if anyone calls,
don't say I'm out of town.

278
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,319
Just say you don't know where I am.

279
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,999
Has the pain come back?

280
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,400
Take care.

281
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:12,158
I'll be careful. I told you,
I'm with colleagues from school.

282
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,199
Okay.

283
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,959
I'll call you back later.
There's no signal here...

284
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:18,879
Talk to you soon.

285
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,799
Bye.

286
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,238
Did you speak to her?

287
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,598
Yes, thanks.

288
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,557
Was she worried?

289
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:32,037
Yes, as usual. She shouldn't,
as she's had a heart operation.

290
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:33,237
Recently?

291
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:38,117
A month ago.
Her doctor asked her to avoid stress.

292
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,517
If I'd called an hour later,
she'd have had a heart attack!

293
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:48,156
"Hello, Mom.
I'm fine. And you?"

294
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:50,556
"Are you eating?"

295
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:52,075
"Of course I am!"

296
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:54,156
She thought I was starving
over there!

297
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:56,836
Once, at Hamburg airport,
they opened my suitcase.

298
00:18:57,156 --> 00:19:00,794
Ajar of pickles had broken,
it stank of vinegar!

299
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:02,435
I was so embarrassed!

300
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:05,035
She must be happy
that you're visiting.

301
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:08,475
She died 2 years ago.

302
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:10,435
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:14,115
It was in the middle
of the mess of my divorce.

304
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:17,274
She suffered a lot.

305
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:23,154
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

306
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:27,434
Nothing too personal?

307
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:28,833
No.

308
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:30,754
Go ahead.

309
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:34,193
Why'd you break up with her?

310
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:38,072
Which one do you mean?

311
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:41,433
You don't have to answer.

312
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:43,353
Why do you want to know?

313
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:48,152
Well, I'd rather know...

314
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:50,592
You'd rather know...

315
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:55,272
One day, we got up, we washed,

316
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:58,711
we had breakfast and she said:
<i>"Achmed,"</i>

317
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:04,152
<i>"Besser eine Ende mit Schrecken..."</i>

318
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,270
<i>"als ein Schrecken ohne Ende."</i>

319
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,071
What?

320
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,629
You say it.

321
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,070
- What?
- <i>Besser...</i>

322
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,670
<i>eine Ende mit Schrecken...</i>

323
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,190
I can't say it.
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:24,510
Shall I pull over?

325
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:28,029
No, I know who it is.
I'll call back later.

326
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,309
So, what does that mean?

327
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:35,029
A bitter ending is better
than an endless bitterness.

328
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,468
That's true.

329
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,788
What music do we have here?

330
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:10,626
- You took long.
- At least 10 minutes!

331
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:13,145
You had a good time, Ahmad?

332
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,106
Hello.

333
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:19,905
Arash, dear,
come and take the things in.

334
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:21,826
It gets cold at night.

335
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:26,544
This is the bedding
for the newlyweds.

336
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:28,024
We're all newlyweds!

337
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:29,865
I mean the just married ones,

338
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:31,585
the bride and groom...

339
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:34,344
Which ones are they?
Show them to me...

340
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:40,024
Congratulations.
I wish you happiness!

341
00:21:48,063 --> 00:21:49,183
What's going on?

342
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:55,502
Are you staying for dinner?

343
00:21:55,503 --> 00:21:59,181
No, thanks.
Lock the doors.

344
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:03,103
Also the cars.
The seafront is not safe.

345
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,783
Come on, guys.

346
00:22:08,102 --> 00:22:11,022
I'll close the door.

347
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:14,062
Eat up, Ahmad!

348
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:17,580
You won't find this in Germany.

349
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:18,941
You mean, for free!

350
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:21,421
Come on, kids.

351
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,420
Why are you standing?

352
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:24,580
Sit down.

353
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:26,220
- Come here, Elly.
- Ahmad...

354
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,420
Make room for Elly.

355
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,299
I'm comfortable here.

356
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,220
Ahmad is not comfortable.

357
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:33,900
Manuchehr!

358
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,940
Make room for Ahmad, sweetie.

359
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,619
Does anyone need anything?

360
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:45,459
Coming.

361
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,098
- Shall I help you?
- I'll do it, thanks.

362
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:50,859
- You're too shy.
- No, I'll help myself.

363
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,897
Here.

364
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:57,338
What's this, you crazy?

365
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:01,098
Keep some for the loo!

366
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:04,537
- Amir!
- Sorry, bathroom.

367
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:06,577
- We're eating!
- No salt?

368
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:07,897
In the kitchen.

369
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:09,214
Manuchehr, go get the salt.

370
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:10,657
Did I forget the salt?

371
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:16,297
Did you wash your hands,
cow-boy?

372
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:21,577
It's getting cold.

373
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:26,576
Congratulations, man.

374
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:33,416
<i>Long live the bride and groom</i>

375
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:46,015
Eat, it's getting cold.

376
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:01,534
Elly, can't you find it?

377
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:12,693
Thanks a lot.

378
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,613
Salt, anyone?

379
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:19,533
Shut up!

380
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,732
Hey guys, come back in.
Why are you among men again?

381
00:24:24,052 --> 00:24:27,011
Ahmad, what are you doing here?
Get up!

382
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:27,492
Why?

383
00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:29,412
- How did it go?
- What?

384
00:24:29,732 --> 00:24:31,211
Your trip together.

385
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:34,212
He's already fallen
head over heels in love.

386
00:24:35,492 --> 00:24:37,890
<i>I am a man in love</i>

387
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:41,650
<i>And I'll do anything...</i>

388
00:24:41,651 --> 00:24:43,371
I'm talking seriously.

389
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:45,529
At the end, we'll vote.

390
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:48,290
If the majority says yes,
I'll ask for her hand.

391
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,409
- If not, I won't.
- The majority means them?

392
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,929
We all agree!

393
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,769
What about you, Amir?

394
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,250
- What is it to me?
- I want your opinion.

395
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:00,769
- She's fine.
- Is that all?

396
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,529
What am I to say?

397
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:05,568
She's warm and calm.
I like her.

398
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:06,929
- Seriously?
- Sure.

399
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:08,329
You mean it?

400
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:12,528
She seems very healthy to me.

401
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:14,048
What about you,
Manuchehr?

402
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:16,288
She's nice and friendly.

403
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:18,768
You know what I think?

404
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:21,168
Don't laugh at me.

405
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:25,127
She's fine.

406
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:26,927
- Honest?
- I swear.

407
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,407
I'm off. You can talk.

408
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:32,766
We'd like 2 cups of tea.

409
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:34,486
Come and join your families!

410
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:36,126
Leave that here!

411
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:37,366
Fire! Fire!

412
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:41,486
What have you done?

413
00:25:43,686 --> 00:25:45,006
Don't work my girl so hard.

414
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:46,965
She's working without a break.

415
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:49,005
No need to work,
we already like you.

416
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,566
- Go on, Elly!
- I want to make tea...

417
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:52,885
Fine. I leave this here.

418
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:56,165
We'll have time to tidy up tomorrow.

419
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:58,566
Come on. Let's go.

420
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:03,964
- How do you find her?
- She's nice.

421
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:06,003
Just a bit shy.

422
00:26:06,004 --> 00:26:07,325
Poor thing is embarrassed.

423
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:10,525
Four words.

424
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:14,403
Second word.

425
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:16,844
- Bird?
- Flying?

426
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:19,404
A fly!

427
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:21,724
Insect?

428
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,042
Bee!

429
00:26:25,604 --> 00:26:27,003
Third word.

430
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:31,242
Honey!

431
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:34,163
Good!

432
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:38,442
Honeybee.

433
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:40,322
Box?
Bee hive?

434
00:26:41,362 --> 00:26:42,522
Television?

435
00:26:43,722 --> 00:26:45,722
Cartoon?

436
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:47,242
The name of a cartoon?

437
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:48,441
<i>Hutch, the Honeybee?</i>

438
00:26:51,881 --> 00:26:53,321
First word?

439
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:57,881
Baby?

440
00:27:00,761 --> 00:27:02,041
Mother?

441
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:04,281
<i>The Mother of Hutch the Honeybee</i>!

442
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,400
Two words?

443
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,199
My love, is it two words?

444
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:17,079
- Mother?
- Child?

445
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,039
Baby?

446
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,719
Second word?

447
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,839
Moustache?
Your father has a moustache?

448
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,878
- Child?
- Father?

449
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:33,118
The child's father?

450
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:34,998
Well done, sweetheart!

451
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,397
Five words?

452
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:47,517
Second word.

453
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:50,637
Child?

454
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,477
- Bigger?
- Many?

455
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:56,197
Kids?

456
00:27:57,796 --> 00:27:58,755
Third word.

457
00:27:59,316 --> 00:28:00,956

Fourth word.

462
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:15,075
- Scales?

463
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:17,555
Law!

464
00:28:19,315 --> 00:28:20,595
Fifth word.

465
00:28:21,755 --> 00:28:23,635
Summer? Heat?

466
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,515
Hot?

467
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:28,394
First word.

468
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,834
The first one.

469
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:34,633
Breathe?

470
00:28:34,634 --> 00:28:35,794
Soul? God?

471
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:41,314
God, the kids from Law School
are hot shots!

472
00:29:05,951 --> 00:29:07,470
I'm going in.

473
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:08,751
- Why?
- Something to do.

474
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:10,511
They were losing!

475
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:15,511
Let's go. Ready?

476
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,709
Elly!

477
00:29:44,188 --> 00:29:46,149
We're going shopping.
Need anything?

478
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:47,668
I'm coming with you.

479
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:50,349
- I'll get what you need.
- I need a bus ticket.

480
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:52,508
No way!

481
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:53,467
Shohreh...

482
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:55,508
Sepideh...

483
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:58,028
Wait...

484
00:29:59,628 --> 00:30:00,988
Arash.

485
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:03,508
<i>No way, there's no way</i>

486
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:07,107
- Shut the door.
- There's no one here, come.

487
00:30:10,987 --> 00:30:12,705
I really have to go back today.

488
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:13,786
<i>There's no way...</i>

489
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:15,826
Are you having such a bad time?

490
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:17,665
No, Nazy.
I already explained.

491
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,786
I can't stay more than 1 night.

492
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:21,585
Weren't the men
going to tidy up?

493
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,266
Arash, don't go into the water.

494
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:25,305
He's so cute.

495
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:27,506
What kind of weekend is that?

496
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:31,025
You won't find a bus.
You'll have to walk back.

497
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:32,184
I may.

498
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:33,144
On foot?

499
00:30:33,786 --> 00:30:34,985
Please, stay!

500
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:38,105
Sweetheart, my mom will tell me off.

501
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:39,705
You coming, Shohreh?

502
00:30:39,945 --> 00:30:41,225
Sepideh...

503
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:46,264
I'd stay if I could.

504
00:30:46,265 --> 00:30:48,464
- You'd better stay.
- My mother will worry.

505
00:30:48,984 --> 00:30:52,103
- Nazy, you look after the kids?
- Yes.

506
00:30:52,104 --> 00:30:54,704
- I'll call her.
- You promised.

507
00:30:55,223 --> 00:30:58,863
Then I'll find a cab
and get tickets on my own.

508
00:30:58,864 --> 00:31:00,702
I can't stay longer.

509
00:31:00,703 --> 00:31:03,863
If she wants to leave,
you shouldn't insist, Sepideh.

510
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:07,463
I wish I could stay.
Sepideh knows I can't.

511
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:10,703
We came together.
We'll leave together.

512
00:31:11,943 --> 00:31:14,022
- See you.
- I won't let her go.

513
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:24,861
Amir... the keys!

514
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:28,580
Where are the keys?

515
00:31:28,581 --> 00:31:29,902
On the terrace, next to my cell.

516
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:37,460
Throw me the ball.

517
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:39,020
Be nice...

518
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:00,459
Arash, darling...

519
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,378
- Stay close by.
- Ok.

520
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,899
Just a bit more and then go inside!

521
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:16,018
Nazy, keep an eye on him, please.

522
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:18,258
Don't forget the onions.

523
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:23,536
What did she say?

524
00:32:23,537 --> 00:32:25,298
We must buy onions.

525
00:32:47,456 --> 00:32:50,936
Relax a little bit.
We'll have soup together later on.

526
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,855
Nice ring.

527
00:32:52,856 --> 00:32:53,416
Thanks.

528
00:32:53,735 --> 00:32:56,975
Can you keep an eye on them?
I'll tidy up a bit.

529
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:11,054
What's up, sweetie?

530
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,172
Can you fix it for me?

531
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:14,334
Yes, give it to me.

532
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:08,890
Come on, take it.

533
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:10,970
I have to go.

534
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:33,848
Daddy!

535
00:34:44,727 --> 00:34:46,047
Yes, darling?

536
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:48,486
Daddy! Arash!

537
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:51,926
Come here.
Leave Arash alone.

538
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:53,206
Arash...

539
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,966
I'll take care of him!

540
00:34:57,527 --> 00:34:59,606
Daddy! Daddy!

541
00:35:00,886 --> 00:35:02,566
- Daddy, Arash!
- Morvarid?

542
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:05,765
Arash is in the water!

543
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:12,085
Arash!

544
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,683
Where's Arash?

545
00:35:25,684 --> 00:35:26,564
Over there!

546
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:27,444
My God!

547
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:29,724
Was he in the water?
Who was with you?

548
00:35:30,644 --> 00:35:31,843
Amir, check the house.

549
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:34,644
Arash!

550
00:35:34,964 --> 00:35:35,923
Is he here?

551
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,042
He's in the sea!

552
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,122
Amir!

553
00:35:49,562 --> 00:35:50,522
His shoes are here!

554
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:54,762
Manuchehr!

555
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,201
Manuchehr!

556
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,520
Ahmad! Ahmad!

557
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,880
Over there!

558
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:35,038
On the other side!

559
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,039
To your left!

560
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:38,799
He's there, Ahmad!

561
00:36:54,038 --> 00:36:54,997
He's there!

562
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:31,635
Ahmad, check if he's breathing.

563
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:34,635
Is he breathing?

564
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:04,273
Put him down.

565
00:38:07,273 --> 00:38:09,832
On the side,
so the water comes out of his lungs.

566
00:38:10,152 --> 00:38:11,672
Lift his head.

567
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,151
Get up, my son!

568
00:38:24,431 --> 00:38:25,390
Arash!

569
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:48,590
You just left them?

570
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,388
Where were the mothers?

571
00:38:50,389 --> 00:38:51,989
Elly was with them.

572
00:39:13,908 --> 00:39:14,908
Ahmad!

573
00:39:19,747 --> 00:39:20,787
Elly!

574
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:24,546
- Was she in the sea?
- Morvarid didn't see her.

575
00:39:24,547 --> 00:39:26,626
Morvarid, where was Elly?

576
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:28,665
- Isn't she inside?
- No.

577
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,466
What if she went after Arash?

578
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,465
Elly!

579
00:39:37,985 --> 00:39:39,345
What's happened?

580
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:43,065
Nazy?

581
00:39:44,106 --> 00:39:45,265
What's wrong?

582
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:50,985
Arash!

583
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:54,384
Was Elly in the sea with you?

584
00:39:54,385 --> 00:39:55,543
Was she in the water?

585
00:39:55,544 --> 00:39:58,105
- Look at me! Was she?
- We can't find her.

586
00:40:11,944 --> 00:40:14,383
Hey, boy! Help!

587
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,703
Run! Go!

588
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:23,903
What a catastrophe!

589
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,341
Peyman?

590
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,181
Arash?

591
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:43,421
Don't worry.
It's Elly.

592
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:44,621
Oh no!

593
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:46,700
She wanted to rescue Arash...

594
00:40:46,701 --> 00:40:48,020
Where's my son?

595
00:40:48,021 --> 00:40:48,980
Inside.

596
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:51,301
Sepideh!

597
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,260
Help!

598
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:57,099
Who's in the sea?

599
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,059
Elly!

600
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,939
Elly?

601
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:05,778
Sepideh!

602
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:08,099
Don't go!

603
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:15,258
Sepideh!

604
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,769
What's going on?

605
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:31,689
- We can't find her.
- Keep on searching!

606
00:43:37,168 --> 00:43:38,967
The sea is heavy and muddy.

607
00:43:38,968 --> 00:43:41,847
You can't just give up!

608
00:43:41,848 --> 00:43:44,128
Wait a minute!
Take me along.

609
00:43:46,968 --> 00:43:49,728
She might be stuck between rocks.

610
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:51,768
Let us go out there!

611
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:56,207
Take me!

612
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:00,847
You didn't try the other direction.

613
00:44:06,287 --> 00:44:08,286
That's where we found the child.

614
00:44:14,286 --> 00:44:16,525
We can't just leave her like this.

615
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:20,166
You have to wait
until the sea gets calmer.

616
00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:25,924
Where are you going?
What if she's still alive?

617
00:44:25,925 --> 00:44:28,365
We searched for over half an hour.

618
00:44:28,685 --> 00:44:30,325
Please! What if she's alive...

619
00:44:30,644 --> 00:44:32,284
She's not alive.

620
00:44:32,605 --> 00:44:35,124
Was I talking to you?

621
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:37,803
Sepideh! Go inside!

622
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:39,244
Shohreh, take her in!

623
00:44:41,684 --> 00:44:44,683
Peyman, don't let them go.

624
00:44:44,684 --> 00:44:47,122
The body will be washed in.

625
00:44:47,123 --> 00:44:50,204
If you check the shore this evening,
you'll find her.

626
00:44:51,243 --> 00:44:52,202
Sepideh!

627
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:54,278
Sepideh...

628
00:45:59,158 --> 00:46:01,478
They want her name and details.

629
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:37,634
She was flying her kite
and didn't see anything.

630
00:46:37,635 --> 00:46:39,755
Did you see her go into the sea?

631
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:42,274
- No.
- What did you see?

632
00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:44,194
Arash was shouting in the water.

633
00:46:44,195 --> 00:46:45,475
Arash is my son.

634
00:46:45,955 --> 00:46:49,314
I called my father to rescue him.

635
00:46:49,315 --> 00:46:52,354
Ok. Are you sure
she was in the water?

636
00:46:52,714 --> 00:46:55,234
I asked her to look after the kids.

637
00:46:55,555 --> 00:46:57,033
What was her name?

638
00:46:57,034 --> 00:46:58,594
- Elly.
- Elly?

639
00:46:59,714 --> 00:47:02,514
You mean:
Elham, Elnaz, Elmira...?

640
00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:06,272
Didn't you know her?

641
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:07,552
We called her Elly.

642
00:47:07,553 --> 00:47:09,312
What was your relationship to her?

643
00:47:09,313 --> 00:47:11,352
She was my daughter's teacher.

644
00:47:11,353 --> 00:47:14,153
My wife had invited her.

645
00:47:14,512 --> 00:47:17,713
You don't know the name
of your child's teacher?

646
00:47:18,112 --> 00:47:19,673
I'll ask.

647
00:47:20,592 --> 00:47:23,871
How strange!
You bring a guest from Tehran

648
00:47:23,872 --> 00:47:25,951
without knowing anything about her

649
00:47:25,952 --> 00:47:27,952
and we must ask a child about her?

650
00:47:28,272 --> 00:47:29,471
What's her full name?

651
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:31,551
I don't know.

652
00:47:32,032 --> 00:47:33,952
You don't know her surname?

653
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:43,710
Unfortunately, she doesn't know.

654
00:47:44,751 --> 00:47:48,670
Look through her things.
There must be an ID or something.

655
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,269
I need the 3 of you
to give me your details.

656
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,349
And your documents, please.

657
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:58,430
Who's the owner of the villa?

658
00:48:18,468 --> 00:48:19,427
Ahmad!

659
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:22,388
Her bag is gone!

660
00:48:22,668 --> 00:48:24,507
Go and search for it.

661
00:48:24,508 --> 00:48:25,788
I did. It's not here!

662
00:48:26,268 --> 00:48:28,827
Nazy, give me Peyman's bag.

663
00:48:29,068 --> 00:48:31,027
Shohreh, her bag is not there!

664
00:48:32,267 --> 00:48:34,067
It must be in her room.

665
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:42,627
She can't have left!

666
00:48:48,506 --> 00:48:49,786
Wasn't she with the kids?

667
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,265
She was about to go.
Sepideh stopped her.

668
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:55,185
She even wanted to walk back.
Right, Shohreh?

669
00:48:55,546 --> 00:48:57,064
Without saying good-bye?

670
00:48:57,065 --> 00:48:58,426
Her bag would be here...

671
00:48:58,665 --> 00:49:00,066
My God...

672
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:05,304
Sepideh!

673
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:15,384
What's her number?

674
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:17,103
- Whose number?
- Elly's.

675
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:18,264
I want to call her cell.

676
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:19,982
What are you saying?

677
00:49:19,983 --> 00:49:21,143
- Her bag...
- What?

678
00:49:21,144 --> 00:49:23,783
It's not there.
She might have left.

679
00:49:23,784 --> 00:49:25,623
No one has seen her in the sea.

680
00:49:31,663 --> 00:49:33,503
I hid it to keep her.

681
00:49:44,822 --> 00:49:46,902
If only I'd let her go...

682
00:49:47,622 --> 00:49:49,942
If only I'd let her go...

683
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,701
My God...

684
00:50:33,459 --> 00:50:34,458
Mom!

685
00:51:06,256 --> 00:51:08,175
God damn you, Sepideh.

686
00:51:10,976 --> 00:51:13,456
We should inform her family.

687
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:16,975
Let's wait and see
if the body's found.

688
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:19,774
Maybe she did leave.

689
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:20,855
Where to?

690
00:51:21,655 --> 00:51:23,015
That's the end of it.

691
00:51:23,895 --> 00:51:24,974
She's dead.

692
00:51:24,975 --> 00:51:26,654
We should call them tomorrow.

693
00:51:26,655 --> 00:51:29,694
Otherwise,
they'll drive up by night...

694
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:33,254
The road is one way.
Everyone's going back to Tehran.

695
00:51:33,454 --> 00:51:35,014
It's just impossible.

696
00:51:38,893 --> 00:51:40,133
Oh God!

697
00:51:44,053 --> 00:51:45,133
Good grief!

698
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,840
Amir...

699
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,798
If she'd drowned,
the body would have been found.

700
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,238
Get up. Let's do something.

701
00:55:10,438 --> 00:55:12,277
You did what you wanted.

702
00:55:12,278 --> 00:55:14,438
Get up, come on.

703
00:55:17,678 --> 00:55:18,957
What for?

704
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,676
Here. I'm up.

705
00:55:20,677 --> 00:55:23,077
Let's go and ask at the bus station.

706
00:55:23,078 --> 00:55:24,397
What can I say to you?

707
00:55:24,597 --> 00:55:25,917
Give me a break...

708
00:55:26,238 --> 00:55:27,677
You give me a break!

709
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:32,637
Maybe she did go away.
You were playing on the other side.

710
00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:34,475
Listen, I'm talking to you.

711
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:36,156
I don't want you to talk to me!

712
00:55:36,836 --> 00:55:38,356
You screw it up
and want to talk?

713
00:55:38,717 --> 00:55:40,196
I'm also at the end of my rope.

714
00:55:41,156 --> 00:55:42,556
Why did you invite her?

715
00:55:42,876 --> 00:55:44,955
Right, it's my fault.
What now?

716
00:55:44,956 --> 00:55:46,756
Nothing.

717
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:48,956
Did you ask me
before inviting her?

718
00:55:49,276 --> 00:55:51,596
- I thought of Ahmad...
- Who are you to Ahmad?

719
00:55:52,556 --> 00:55:53,835
Are you his mother?

720
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:56,274
His sister?
Who are you?

721
00:56:04,714 --> 00:56:05,673
What's going on?

722
00:56:12,074 --> 00:56:14,594
- What could she do about it?
- Nothing.

723
00:56:14,874 --> 00:56:16,473
Nothing at all.

724
00:56:18,433 --> 00:56:19,753
I asked her to invite her.

725
00:56:20,114 --> 00:56:21,633
You shouldn't have!

726
00:56:22,393 --> 00:56:24,153
Why always her?

727
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:25,912
You'll Wake the kids.

728
00:56:26,752 --> 00:56:29,112
You should know
how crazy she is by now!

729
00:56:29,113 --> 00:56:32,151
Who'd have thought
this would happen?

730
00:56:32,152 --> 00:56:34,551
She's always involved in everything!

731
00:56:34,552 --> 00:56:36,551
We want to go to the sea:
Sepideh!

732
00:56:36,552 --> 00:56:38,711
We want to get together:
Sepideh!

733
00:56:38,712 --> 00:56:40,310
We need a villa:
Sepideh!

734
00:56:40,311 --> 00:56:43,112
You need a plane ticket:
Sepideh!

735
00:56:43,351 --> 00:56:45,391
Now the man wants to get married:
Sepideh!

736
00:56:48,911 --> 00:56:50,870
Let's go in.
We'll work this out.

737
00:56:50,871 --> 00:56:52,311
What exactly?

738
00:56:52,831 --> 00:56:55,230
We must call her parents.

739
00:56:55,231 --> 00:56:57,951
We will.
But first, let's go in.

740
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:02,231
Whoever explains best what happened
will get a treat.

741
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,590
So, you start:
What were you doing?

742
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:08,428
I was fixing my kite.

743
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:09,469
And then?

744
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,510
Arash was in the water.

745
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:14,188
And where was Elly?

746
00:57:14,189 --> 00:57:15,428
She was sitting there.

747
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:17,028
On the terrace.

748
00:57:17,029 --> 00:57:18,148
What were you doing?

749
00:57:18,149 --> 00:57:21,748
I asked her to fix my kite.

750
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:25,629
Then it flew off very high,
it fell in the water and I saw Arash.

751
00:57:27,828 --> 00:57:31,228
When the kite was up in the sky,

752
00:57:31,428 --> 00:57:33,187
was Elly with you?

753
00:57:33,188 --> 00:57:37,428
Look at me. You were here.
Where was Elly?

754
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,227
Like Nazy is now?

755
00:57:40,907 --> 00:57:43,627
Yes. She was there at first.

756
00:57:44,547 --> 00:57:45,747
And then?

757
00:57:46,707 --> 00:57:51,906
I ran after my kite on the other side

758
00:57:52,706 --> 00:57:55,706
and there I saw Arash.

759
00:57:55,707 --> 00:57:56,986
You saw Arash.

760
00:57:58,546 --> 00:57:59,986
Stop it, Arash!

761
00:58:01,226 --> 00:58:04,265
Anita. Did you see
Elly leave the villa?

762
00:58:07,105 --> 00:58:08,986
- Look at me.
- I didn't see.

763
00:58:12,065 --> 00:58:13,824
Morvarid, sweetie,

764
00:58:13,825 --> 00:58:18,623
when your kite fell into the water

765
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:20,463
and you saw Arash about to drown

766
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:23,544
was Elly there
or was she leaving the villa?

767
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:25,344
- She was there.
- Ok.

768
00:58:26,864 --> 00:58:30,903
And when you came over to us
as we were playing volleyball,

769
00:58:30,904 --> 00:58:33,582
you know,
you were crying and calling us,

770
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:35,102
was Elly still there?

771
00:58:35,103 --> 00:58:36,984
She was there before.

772
00:58:37,944 --> 00:58:39,622
Long before?

773
00:58:39,623 --> 00:58:40,582
A bit before.

774
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,462
How much is a bit?

775
00:58:42,463 --> 00:58:44,342
Counting from 1...

776
00:58:44,343 --> 00:58:47,103
1... 2... 3... 4...?

777
00:58:48,142 --> 00:58:51,222
1... 2... 3...

778
00:58:53,342 --> 00:58:54,702
I don't know.

779
00:58:56,102 --> 00:58:57,580
What about you, Arash?

780
00:58:57,581 --> 00:59:00,822
When you were in the water,
did Elly come get you out?

781
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:05,260
- Sit up and answer properly!
- I did a 100 times!

782
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:07,260
Sit up and answer.

783
00:59:07,261 --> 00:59:09,101
- I'm hungry.
- Then go out!

784
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,380
Peyman!

785
00:59:10,941 --> 00:59:13,300
Can't you just behave?

786
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:16,099
- He's hungry.
- I didn't see anything!

787
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,180
What's wrong with you?

788
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,819
He doesn't answer.

789
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:23,019
Since yesterday,
you've been mistreating him.

790
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,539
Ok, go away
and stop talking so much!

791
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,698
So he'll take all the blame?

792
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:31,218
You left him by the sea!

793
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:34,419
You should have thought of that
when you chose this villa.

794
00:59:36,499 --> 00:59:38,419
Anita, come.

795
00:59:51,698 --> 00:59:53,098
Any news?

796
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:55,177
Not since last night.

797
00:59:56,537 --> 00:59:58,057
Why would she have left?

798
00:59:58,537 --> 01:00:00,137
No idea.

799
01:00:01,178 --> 01:00:03,337
She'd have taken her bag.

800
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:05,217
Didn't Sepideh hide it?

801
01:00:06,857 --> 01:00:07,816
Sepideh,

802
01:00:08,457 --> 01:00:10,736
was Elly the kind
to do such a thing?

803
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:11,857
Do what?

804
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:13,976
Leave without a word.

805
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:15,816
I don't know.

806
01:00:16,137 --> 01:00:18,615
So, why did you hide her bag?

807
01:00:19,016 --> 01:00:22,214
You must have supposed
this could happen.

808
01:00:22,215 --> 01:00:24,456
Like the other evening,
she just vanished...

809
01:00:24,776 --> 01:00:26,454
We had to look for her.

810
01:00:26,455 --> 01:00:28,336
There was no signal.

811
01:00:29,255 --> 01:00:30,855
She went to make a phone call.

812
01:00:31,135 --> 01:00:32,215
Without a word.

813
01:00:32,535 --> 01:00:34,813
- That was different.
- Why?

814
01:00:34,814 --> 01:00:36,774
- Why would she've left?
- Out of pique.

815
01:00:36,775 --> 01:00:37,734
What?

816
01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:39,175
She might have been offended.

817
01:00:41,374 --> 01:00:42,614
By what?

818
01:00:45,414 --> 01:00:49,854
Did any of us say or do something
that might have offended her?

819
01:00:50,053 --> 01:00:51,654
Dad, I'm hungry.

820
01:00:55,813 --> 01:00:59,053
The other night,
when I was preparing the chicken,

821
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:00,652
you all came over.

822
01:01:00,653 --> 01:01:05,732
The lady had brought the bedding
and she started clapping and singing.

823
01:01:05,733 --> 01:01:08,132
And you ululated, Shohreh.

824
01:01:08,612 --> 01:01:11,972
I had the impression
that Elly was offended.

825
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:15,172
Did I ululate?
That was in fun.

826
01:01:15,732 --> 01:01:17,131
I just thought...

827
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,091
And during the dinner?

828
01:01:18,932 --> 01:01:21,731
She went to get salt
and we all laughed.

829
01:01:23,531 --> 01:01:25,890
No. It was just the two of us joking.

830
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:26,851
We all laughed.

831
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:28,770
But she did, too.

832
01:01:28,771 --> 01:01:31,491
All this messing around
and dancing...

833
01:01:32,091 --> 01:01:33,210
Maybe she disliked it.

834
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:37,451
She insisted on leaving yesterday,
as if she was upset.

835
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:40,769
I told you not to force her to stay.

836
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:42,210
She was standing right there.

837
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,769
You even joked
about her walking back

838
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:45,890
and she said she would.

839
01:01:54,049 --> 01:01:55,129
Sepideh?

840
01:01:56,009 --> 01:01:58,047
You know her.

841
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,927
Was she the kind to act on a whim?

842
01:02:00,928 --> 01:02:02,368
Get offended and just leave?

843
01:02:02,369 --> 01:02:03,728
Offended by what?

844
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:07,607
She doesn't even know her name.
Why are you asking her?

845
01:02:07,608 --> 01:02:10,728
Amir, stop quibbling.
We're trying to move forward.

846
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,406
When we were washing up,

847
01:02:14,407 --> 01:02:16,447
Sepideh, you said something,

848
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:19,607
and Shohreh said: "No need to work,
we already like you."

849
01:02:19,968 --> 01:02:21,567
I think she took it badly.

850
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,885
I didn't mean anything nasty.

851
01:02:25,886 --> 01:02:30,206
I know. I thought
she might have got it wrong.

852
01:02:30,207 --> 01:02:32,167
Don't go blaming me for this, too.

853
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:34,045
Come on...

854
01:02:34,046 --> 01:02:37,886
It'd be so childish
to leave for such a thing!

855
01:02:38,206 --> 01:02:39,165
We're just talking.

856
01:02:39,205 --> 01:02:43,245
Do you know how they've been
looking at my son since yesterday?

857
01:02:43,246 --> 01:02:46,124
We're just hoping
she left because she was hurt.

858
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:48,164
Ahmad, that's not
what I'm talking about.

859
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:51,004
It doesn't make sense to leave
because you're hurt.

860
01:02:51,005 --> 01:02:52,884
If she was a sensible person.

861
01:02:53,245 --> 01:02:55,964
Really, if she's just left like this,

862
01:02:55,965 --> 01:02:58,723
without a word, she's a...

863
01:02:58,724 --> 01:02:59,803
Peyman...

864
01:02:59,804 --> 01:03:03,883
The lady told us the place
wasn't safe. What if someone...

865
01:03:03,884 --> 01:03:05,243
Why are you arguing?

866
01:03:05,724 --> 01:03:08,204
Call Tehran
and you'll see if she's home.

867
01:03:08,644 --> 01:03:11,483
Isn't it too early?
It's only 7:30.

868
01:03:11,484 --> 01:03:14,443
I don't care.
This is driving me crazy.

869
01:03:14,803 --> 01:03:16,923
Ahmad, let's go and call.

870
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:19,962
You stay here.
Ahmad, you go alone.

871
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,083
- Why?
- Stay here.

872
01:03:21,403 --> 01:03:23,641
- Ahmad alone?
- You've done enough harm.

873
01:03:23,642 --> 01:03:25,561
It's better if a woman calls.

874
01:03:25,562 --> 01:03:27,802
Is Sepideh the only woman here?

875
01:03:28,482 --> 01:03:30,362
I don't mind going.

876
01:03:31,281 --> 01:03:33,042
But if ever she's not back...

877
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:36,080
I don't even dare think of it.

878
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:38,362
- Amir, let me...
- I said no!

879
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:40,201
Ahmad, let's go.

880
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:41,760
I'm going with you.

881
01:03:41,921 --> 01:03:43,000
I'll take care of it.

882
01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:44,441
Come on, Manuchehr.

883
01:03:45,441 --> 01:03:46,441
Ahmad...

884
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,680
Sepideh, give me the number.

885
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,679
You want me to go with them?

886
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,200
No, Ahmad's gone.

887
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,239
Go and get breakfast for the kids.

888
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,360
They can go
one day without breakfast.

889
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,839
They won't starve.

890
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,919
The car keys.

891
01:04:05,879 --> 01:04:07,239
Some weekend!

892
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,838
Keep on...
Don't accelerate!

893
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:18,358
The other tire is stuck, too.

894
01:04:20,678 --> 01:04:21,637
Ahmad!

895
01:04:21,879 --> 01:04:23,998
It's stuck deep.

896
01:04:25,918 --> 01:04:27,958
Get out.
We won't make it.

897
01:04:35,077 --> 01:04:37,918
If her mother answers,
don't say anything.

898
01:04:38,517 --> 01:04:39,597
Why?

899
01:04:40,237 --> 01:04:43,636
The other day, Elly told me
she'd had a heart operation.

900
01:04:43,637 --> 01:04:45,236
We must be careful.

901
01:04:48,877 --> 01:04:52,155
A stranger drowned
because of our son.

902
01:04:52,156 --> 01:04:53,755
Do you realize that?

903
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:56,755
And all you care about
is talking back to me?

904
01:04:56,756 --> 01:04:58,675
Don't talk to me like that.

905
01:04:59,755 --> 01:05:02,794
I've told you a 100 times,
not to talk like that.

906
01:05:02,795 --> 01:05:04,195
Like what?

907
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:08,434
Nothing else matters now?
How do I talk to you?

908
01:05:08,435 --> 01:05:10,033
As you've always done.

909
01:05:10,034 --> 01:05:12,393
I've been the same since we met,

910
01:05:12,394 --> 01:05:15,274
and I'll still be the same fool
in 20 years!

911
01:05:15,635 --> 01:05:17,073
I want to go back to Tehran.

912
01:05:17,074 --> 01:05:19,154
- You can't.
- I want to go home.

913
01:05:24,674 --> 01:05:25,833
Shohreh...

914
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:27,633
Don't Shohreh me.
I want to go back.

915
01:05:27,834 --> 01:05:31,192
The sound of the sea
is driving me crazy.

916
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,313
My son wet the bed.

917
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,473
He's being mistreated.

918
01:05:35,793 --> 01:05:37,153
I'm worse off than all of you.

919
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,191
I can't forget about this girl...

920
01:05:40,192 --> 01:05:42,752
Sepideh, have you got painkillers?

921
01:05:42,753 --> 01:05:44,833
There are some in my bag.

922
01:05:51,632 --> 01:05:52,791
It was the mother again.

923
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:54,552
Don't hang up.

924
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,430
She's got heart problems...

925
01:05:56,431 --> 01:06:00,950
Say you're one of her pupils' father
and you want to talk about the child.

926
01:06:00,951 --> 01:06:03,311
So early in the morning?

927
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:06,031
With an out-of-town number?

928
01:06:06,511 --> 01:06:08,110
Say you're her friend's husband.

929
01:06:08,111 --> 01:06:09,550
Sepideh should be here.

930
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:19,269
You poor loves, what a honeymoon!

931
01:06:19,989 --> 01:06:21,390
Thank you.

932
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:24,909
Honk at the dog.

933
01:06:28,189 --> 01:06:29,309
Where are you going?

934
01:06:29,629 --> 01:06:31,068
I was worried.

935
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:32,628
- Get in.
- Was she back home?

936
01:06:32,629 --> 01:06:33,588
Get in.

937
01:06:35,509 --> 01:06:36,988
What happened?

938
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:39,548
Did she have problems
with her family?

939
01:06:39,549 --> 01:06:40,788
Why?

940
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,708
Her mother was quite cold.

941
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:44,467
So she wasn't there?

942
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:46,548
First, she said she'd gone out.

943
01:06:47,428 --> 01:06:49,227
Thank God!

944
01:06:49,228 --> 01:06:50,426
No, wait...

945
01:06:50,427 --> 01:06:55,147
She didn't even acknowledge
that she'd been on a trip.

946
01:06:55,468 --> 01:06:57,547
- What do you mean?
- She lied.

947
01:06:57,787 --> 01:07:01,665
I said I'd call her on her cell
but she said she'd left it at home.

948
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:03,306
Didn't she have it with her?

949
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:05,747
She kept asking who I was.

950
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:08,266
Did her family know
she was here with us?

951
01:07:08,986 --> 01:07:12,105
Didn't she call her mother
the other day?

952
01:07:12,106 --> 01:07:14,786
Yes, but her mother...

953
01:07:15,186 --> 01:07:16,146
Her mother...

954
01:07:16,345 --> 01:07:19,865
seemed peculiar... wary.

955
01:07:19,866 --> 01:07:22,984
Maybe because
we hung up a couple of times...

956
01:07:22,985 --> 01:07:27,145
Why would she be suspicious
if she trusted her daughter?

957
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:29,465
How long have you known her?

958
01:07:30,665 --> 01:07:32,224
Not long.

959
01:07:51,743 --> 01:07:53,063
What happened?

960
01:07:56,343 --> 01:07:58,301
No answer.

961
01:07:58,302 --> 01:08:00,863
What a drag!

962
01:08:02,702 --> 01:08:04,781
You should have tried again.

963
01:08:04,782 --> 01:08:05,741
Ahmad...

964
01:08:05,742 --> 01:08:08,062
We tried 10 times.

965
01:08:13,701 --> 01:08:14,661
Sepideh...

966
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:16,301
Come here.

967
01:08:22,021 --> 01:08:23,380
What is it?

968
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,220
Where's her cell?

969
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:30,779
Why?

970
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:34,019
We must inform someone she knows
and get this over with.

971
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,900
She must have taken it with her.

972
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,778
Where to?

973
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:40,740
I have no idea.
Why all the questions?

974
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,218
Come here!

975
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:45,098
- What's with you?
- What do you know about her?

976
01:08:45,099 --> 01:08:46,899
What I know about her?

977
01:08:48,939 --> 01:08:51,938
Whose is this?
It's hers, right?

978
01:08:51,939 --> 01:08:54,258
- Where was that?
- In your bag.

979
01:08:54,658 --> 01:08:56,738
Why was her cell in your bag?

980
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:58,058
I'd forgotten completely.

981
01:08:58,339 --> 01:09:02,497
I found it by the window last night
and I put it away.

982
01:09:02,498 --> 01:09:04,697
Don't lie to me!

983
01:09:04,698 --> 01:09:06,176
What's wrong with you?

984
01:09:06,177 --> 01:09:07,457
Leave me alone!

985
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:09,617
Leave me! You swine!

986
01:09:10,017 --> 01:09:13,418
What the hell is wrong with you?
Why won't you speak?

987
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:14,976
You lying idiot!

988
01:09:14,977 --> 01:09:17,577
Amir, shame on you!
Get away from her!

989
01:09:17,897 --> 01:09:19,615
Don't interfere!

990
01:09:19,616 --> 01:09:21,097
Don't you interfere, Shohreh.

991
01:09:21,656 --> 01:09:23,376
Get in the car.

992
01:09:23,936 --> 01:09:25,535
Shame on you!

993
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,455
Get in the car.

994
01:09:27,456 --> 01:09:29,136
Peyman, I'm going back to Tehran.

995
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:31,215
She drowned, she's dead.

996
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:33,216
Do you want to kill us, too?

997
01:09:33,496 --> 01:09:34,974
I'm not staying here!

998
01:09:34,975 --> 01:09:37,416
- What are you doing?
- She's lying.

999
01:09:37,735 --> 01:09:39,214
I want to know

1000
01:09:39,215 --> 01:09:41,815
why this cell is in your bag!

1001
01:09:42,735 --> 01:09:43,655
What the hell?

1002
01:09:43,656 --> 01:09:46,815
You'd better not interfere!
Just shut your mouth!

1003
01:09:47,695 --> 01:09:48,974
Go away, Ahmad, go on.

1004
01:09:49,374 --> 01:09:51,694
Why does no one say anything here?

1005
01:09:52,174 --> 01:09:54,733
Stay if you want,
but I'm leaving!

1006
01:09:54,734 --> 01:09:56,974
Let's go, Sepideh.

1007
01:10:01,374 --> 01:10:02,374
Ahmad!

1008
01:10:02,774 --> 01:10:04,133
Go inside, please.

1009
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:06,652
Morvarid, go in, darling...

1010
01:10:06,653 --> 01:10:07,613
Peyman...

1011
01:10:10,613 --> 01:10:12,413
She's driving me crazy!

1012
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:20,532
The women and the kids
should go back to Tehran.

1013
01:10:20,893 --> 01:10:23,012
We'll stay and see what happens.

1014
01:10:26,811 --> 01:10:29,532
She got me to raise my hand to her.

1015
01:10:31,491 --> 01:10:33,451
I can't leave.

1016
01:10:33,651 --> 01:10:35,411
They all want to go home.

1017
01:10:35,412 --> 01:10:36,931
Let's go, Mom.

1018
01:10:37,251 --> 01:10:38,811
The poor kid's having a hard time.

1019
01:10:39,131 --> 01:10:41,291
You go ahead.
I have to stay.

1020
01:10:41,531 --> 01:10:45,089
Sepideh, it makes no difference
if you stay here.

1021
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:46,969
I just can't, Peyman.

1022
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:48,171
Nazy...

1023
01:10:48,731 --> 01:10:50,010
She hurt her leg.

1024
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:53,889
Sepideh, look at me...

1025
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,609
No, Ahmad.

1026
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:59,888
Assuming this girl
did leave without a word,

1027
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:02,648
is she worth the trouble
you're getting yourself in?

1028
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:04,769
A girl you hardly know
anything about.

1029
01:11:05,089 --> 01:11:06,689
- Peyman...
- No, really?

1030
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:08,048
Peyman.

1031
01:11:08,049 --> 01:11:11,449
If she went into the sea for Arash,
isn't she worth it?

1032
01:11:11,769 --> 01:11:15,288
How can you possibly know
if she went for my Arash?

1033
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:19,128
Besides, I didn't ask her
to look after my child.

1034
01:11:19,528 --> 01:11:21,087
Leave her, if she wants to stay.

1035
01:11:21,088 --> 01:11:23,007
We're just talking, Peyman.

1036
01:11:23,008 --> 01:11:24,888
Why are you insisting?

1037
01:11:27,607 --> 01:11:32,206
Did I invite the woman?
Rent a villa by the sea?

1038
01:11:32,207 --> 01:11:33,127
Force her to stay?

1039
01:11:33,128 --> 01:11:35,127
That was all my doing.

1040
01:11:35,767 --> 01:11:38,047
So now, you can all go.

1041
01:11:47,926 --> 01:11:50,325
Get Elly's cell from Amir.

1042
01:11:51,685 --> 01:11:52,766
Amir...

1043
01:11:54,366 --> 01:11:56,365
Can I have Elly's cell?

1044
01:11:59,525 --> 01:12:00,725
Thanks.

1045
01:12:06,644 --> 01:12:08,683
How do you unlock it?

1046
01:12:08,684 --> 01:12:11,763
Call one of the numbers on the list.

1047
01:12:11,764 --> 01:12:15,204
What time did I go out with her
the other day?

1048
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,684
Around eight, I think.

1049
01:12:18,484 --> 01:12:22,042
Her cell rang. She didn't answer
and said she'd call back.

1050
01:12:22,043 --> 01:12:25,082
Call that number
and tell whoever answers the story.

1051
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:27,722
I think we should all stay.

1052
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:31,123
Won't her family get suspicious
if they come and find 4 men here?

1053
01:12:31,443 --> 01:12:33,722
The mother was already suspicious.

1054
01:12:33,723 --> 01:12:36,602
But you said you didn't get through.

1055
01:12:37,362 --> 01:12:39,802
Wait a bit.
I'll try and call.

1056
01:12:39,803 --> 01:12:41,602
We'll see what happens.

1057
01:12:43,082 --> 01:12:45,202
So you did speak to her mother?

1058
01:12:46,082 --> 01:12:49,201
She didn't even know
her daughter was out of town.

1059
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,240
Come on, Manuchehr.

1060
01:12:52,241 --> 01:12:54,801
- Where are the keys?
- On the ignition.

1061
01:12:56,081 --> 01:12:57,761
On the ignition.

1062
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,439
What a weird girl!

1063
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,399
How was her cell found?

1064
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,040
It was in Sepideh's bag.

1065
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:10,480
Nazy needed painkillers
and she found it there.

1066
01:13:18,799 --> 01:13:20,079
Wait, Ahmad.

1067
01:13:27,599 --> 01:13:28,719
Where are you going?

1068
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:31,117
- Make a phone call.
- To whom?

1069
01:13:31,118 --> 01:13:33,077
A number on her call-list.

1070
01:13:33,078 --> 01:13:35,518
- I'll go with you.
- You know how Amir is...

1071
01:13:35,838 --> 01:13:36,877
I'm coming.

1072
01:13:36,878 --> 01:13:38,837
I'll call and come back.

1073
01:13:38,838 --> 01:13:40,037
Mom, I want to come, too.

1074
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:41,676
Ahmad...

1075
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:43,717
Drive on.

1076
01:13:53,437 --> 01:13:55,597
Shohreh entrusted the children to me.

1077
01:13:58,996 --> 01:14:01,436
Remember playing charades
the other night?

1078
01:14:02,996 --> 01:14:05,036
At some point, Elly said "Wreath".

1079
01:14:05,756 --> 01:14:07,994
It sounded like a premonition

1080
01:14:07,995 --> 01:14:09,955
of what was going to happen to her.

1081
01:14:11,755 --> 01:14:14,474
It was all written.
It was her fate, poor thing.

1082
01:14:14,475 --> 01:14:15,835
That's nobody's fault.

1083
01:14:16,155 --> 01:14:18,234
Manuchehr, I had a dream.

1084
01:14:18,235 --> 01:14:19,195
What dream?

1085
01:14:19,515 --> 01:14:21,075
A nightmare.

1086
01:14:22,435 --> 01:14:25,034
I can't stop thinking about it.

1087
01:14:27,114 --> 01:14:28,555
Shall we go back?

1088
01:14:29,074 --> 01:14:31,074
No. Let's drive on.

1089
01:15:02,152 --> 01:15:03,472
- She wasn't back home?
- No.

1090
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:06,551
Who did you speak to?

1091
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:09,430
- Her brother.
- Did you tell him?

1092
01:15:09,431 --> 01:15:11,871
I described her
and asked if he knew her.

1093
01:15:11,872 --> 01:15:15,311
I said I had his number from the cell

1094
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:19,590
and asked if he'd heard from her.

1095
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:21,071
He asked why I had her phone.

1096
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:25,670
I asked him how well he knew her.
He said he was her brother.

1097
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:29,110
But he wasn't home last night
and hadn't heard from her.

1098
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:31,109
So I had to tell him.

1099
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:34,109
- That she drowned?
- No, I couldn't say it.

1100
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:38,308
I said we'd had a car accident

1101
01:15:38,309 --> 01:15:40,228
and she was in hospital.

1102
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:42,868
He said she wasn't supposed to be
at the seaside.

1103
01:15:42,869 --> 01:15:44,069
She hadn't told her family.

1104
01:15:46,029 --> 01:15:48,708
That's why
she was so eager to go back.

1105
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:50,787
What now?
Are they coming here?

1106
01:15:50,788 --> 01:15:52,547
Yes. He called me back.

1107
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:55,308
He'll be at Chalus Square at 4.

1108
01:15:57,028 --> 01:15:58,988
How will we explain it to him?

1109
01:15:59,907 --> 01:16:01,908
We'll have to find a way.

1110
01:16:02,947 --> 01:16:04,948
One of the women must come along.

1111
01:16:06,027 --> 01:16:07,826
One woman must come with me.

1112
01:16:07,827 --> 01:16:08,786
What did he say?

1113
01:16:08,987 --> 01:16:10,947
One of the women
has to go with him.

1114
01:16:21,306 --> 01:16:24,066
Stop, Ahmad.
I feel sick.

1115
01:16:26,626 --> 01:16:28,066
You didn't eat anything.

1116
01:16:32,665 --> 01:16:34,585
Shall I get you something?

1117
01:16:49,184 --> 01:16:51,304
Shall I take Nazy along instead?

1118
01:16:55,703 --> 01:16:57,064
He's not her brother.

1119
01:16:58,743 --> 01:16:59,944
Who's not her brother?

1120
01:17:00,863 --> 01:17:03,263
The guy we're going to meet.

1121
01:17:05,543 --> 01:17:09,462
She was an only child.
I once asked about her siblings.

1122
01:17:12,062 --> 01:17:13,903
Who is he then?

1123
01:17:18,902 --> 01:17:21,062
I think he's her fiancé.

1124
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:26,781
Whose fiancé?

1125
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:29,581
Elly's.

1126
01:17:35,181 --> 01:17:37,820
What's that you're saying, Sepideh?

1127
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:40,661
Was she engaged?

1128
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:46,940
What on earth
have you done, Sepideh?

1129
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:50,260
What have you done?

1130
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:57,499
If you knew that,
why did you introduce her to me?

1131
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:01,339
She's been trying to break off
the engagement for 6 months.

1132
01:18:02,619 --> 01:18:04,219
But he won't let her go.

1133
01:18:05,658 --> 01:18:06,778
Oh shit...

1134
01:18:09,339 --> 01:18:10,458
Oh shit!

1135
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:14,738
I hid her cell
so that you wouldn't call him.

1136
01:18:43,256 --> 01:18:44,416
Isn't that him?

1137
01:18:44,856 --> 01:18:46,255
The guy with the bag.

1138
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:48,376
I don't know.

1139
01:18:55,095 --> 01:18:56,895
Hello. How are you?

1140
01:18:57,095 --> 01:18:58,734
Have you arrived?

1141
01:18:59,775 --> 01:19:02,294
We're on the square.

1142
01:19:02,535 --> 01:19:06,293
Opposite a surgical clinic.

1143
01:19:06,294 --> 01:19:07,333
Imam Reza.

1144
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:09,214
Imam Reza Clinic.

1145
01:19:10,774 --> 01:19:12,973
Where? A green Pride?

1146
01:19:14,174 --> 01:19:16,094
No, I can't see your car.

1147
01:19:19,573 --> 01:19:21,492
On the other side of the bridge?

1148
01:19:21,493 --> 01:19:22,933
On the ring road, right.

1149
01:19:23,253 --> 01:19:24,852
Yes, I see.

1150
01:19:24,853 --> 01:19:25,853
I'll be right there.

1151
01:19:26,172 --> 01:19:29,413
We're in a Patrol.
See you in a minute.

1152
01:19:29,653 --> 01:19:31,532
- Did he drive here?
- Yes.

1153
01:19:33,492 --> 01:19:35,452
- You'll go in his car.
- No.

1154
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:37,251
There's no other way.

1155
01:19:37,252 --> 01:19:40,092
I have to go warn the others.

1156
01:19:51,091 --> 01:19:53,971
He mustn't find out
we know he's her fiancé.

1157
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:57,009
I'll drive ahead.
You come with him.

1158
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:59,171
- Amir mustn't find out.
- I know.

1159
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:07,169
Hello.

1160
01:20:07,729 --> 01:20:09,010
Are you Alireza?

1161
01:20:09,011 --> 01:20:10,930
Ahmad. How are you?

1162
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,289
Have you been here long?

1163
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:15,328
Did your car hit her?

1164
01:20:15,329 --> 01:20:17,248
A friend of ours did.

1165
01:20:17,249 --> 01:20:19,248
Which hospital is she in?

1166
01:20:19,249 --> 01:20:21,208
- We'll take you there.
- How is she?

1167
01:20:21,209 --> 01:20:23,408
We shouldn't waste time.

1168
01:20:23,409 --> 01:20:24,328
Let's go.

1169
01:20:24,329 --> 01:20:25,967
Can you give me her cell?

1170
01:20:25,968 --> 01:20:27,327
It's not here.

1171
01:20:27,328 --> 01:20:29,967
- What happened exactly?
- I'll explain everything.

1172
01:20:29,968 --> 01:20:31,767
Ahmad, drive on!

1173
01:20:31,768 --> 01:20:33,008
I'll tell you.

1174
01:20:34,368 --> 01:20:35,448
Where are we going?

1175
01:20:36,848 --> 01:20:38,846
Just stay on the ring road.

1176
01:20:38,847 --> 01:20:40,568
If anything's happened, tell me.

1177
01:20:42,007 --> 01:20:43,087
They already told you.

1178
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:45,207
Is she alive?

1179
01:20:48,047 --> 01:20:51,326
Yes, but her condition
isn't very good.

1180
01:20:54,126 --> 01:20:55,726
She's in a coma.

1181
01:20:55,886 --> 01:20:57,486
Oh, my God!

1182
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:02,285
She wasn't supposed to come here.
When was the accident?

1183
01:21:02,526 --> 01:21:04,245
We'll talk while driving.

1184
01:21:04,246 --> 01:21:07,245
Stop tangling me up, please...

1185
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:09,085
You saw her ID, didn't you?

1186
01:21:09,526 --> 01:21:11,165
What's her name?

1187
01:21:12,205 --> 01:21:13,165
Elly.

1188
01:21:16,525 --> 01:21:18,764
Is it the name written on her ID?

1189
01:21:20,524 --> 01:21:23,564
Elly is my daughter's teacher.

1190
01:21:23,964 --> 01:21:26,283
We didn't want to give you a shock.

1191
01:21:26,284 --> 01:21:29,004
She came up here with us and...

1192
01:21:29,324 --> 01:21:30,443
What are you doing?

1193
01:21:30,444 --> 01:21:32,243
And the story about the accident?

1194
01:21:32,244 --> 01:21:35,082
I'm sorry. We'll go in a second.

1195
01:21:35,083 --> 01:21:37,843
Can't you go bill and coo elsewhere?

1196
01:21:38,843 --> 01:21:40,122
I'm a total wreck now...

1197
01:21:40,123 --> 01:21:42,602
- I'm worse!
- Go ride a donkey!

1198
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:46,762
- How about I ride you instead?
- Shut up!

1199
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:54,442
Hello, Ahmad!

1200
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:02,042
Hello!

1201
01:22:06,641 --> 01:22:07,600
Amir!

1202
01:22:07,801 --> 01:22:09,440
Peyman, Shohreh!

1203
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:10,600
Where's Amir?

1204
01:22:10,601 --> 01:22:11,841
Come on, Nazy, quick.

1205
01:22:13,241 --> 01:22:14,641
Peyman, come here.

1206
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,921
What's wrong, Ahmad?

1207
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,600
Hurry up, Amir.

1208
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,000
Come here.
Hurry up.

1209
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,240
The guy is on his way.

1210
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,958
Did you tell him?

1211
01:22:28,959 --> 01:22:30,719
He's not her brother at all.

1212
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:31,999
He's her fiancé.

1213
01:22:33,479 --> 01:22:34,919
She has a fiancé?

1214
01:22:35,239 --> 01:22:36,398
My goodness!

1215
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:37,558
What do you mean, fiancé?

1216
01:22:37,559 --> 01:22:41,558
I don't know. But he has to believe
we think he's her brother.

1217
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:45,197
She comes here,
she goes out with you

1218
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:47,077
and now she's got a fiancé?

1219
01:22:47,078 --> 01:22:48,758
Please, this is not the time.

1220
01:22:49,678 --> 01:22:50,837
How did you find out?

1221
01:22:50,838 --> 01:22:53,158
A friend of hers rang on the way.

1222
01:22:53,637 --> 01:22:56,637
I told her about the accident

1223
01:22:56,837 --> 01:22:58,637
and about her brother coming.

1224
01:23:00,198 --> 01:23:02,316
She said
Elly doesn't have a brother.

1225
01:23:02,317 --> 01:23:04,557
I asked who this man could be.

1226
01:23:05,077 --> 01:23:07,436
She said it had to be her fiancé.

1227
01:23:07,437 --> 01:23:10,477
If she's engaged,
why did she come here with us?

1228
01:23:10,877 --> 01:23:13,115
She didn't seem to be the kind...

1229
01:23:13,116 --> 01:23:15,796
Yes, she did. Only we...

1230
01:23:16,276 --> 01:23:17,676
are too naive.

1231
01:23:18,676 --> 01:23:22,756
Then maybe she didn't drown.

1232
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:24,674
Maybe she just ran off.

1233
01:23:24,675 --> 01:23:28,594
If ever he finds out why we brought
his fiancee here,

1234
01:23:28,595 --> 01:23:30,434
he'll cause us trouble.

1235
01:23:30,435 --> 01:23:31,955
What do we do?

1236
01:23:32,195 --> 01:23:34,755
We'll pretend we don't have a clue.

1237
01:23:35,115 --> 01:23:36,993
He's the brother.

1238
01:23:36,994 --> 01:23:40,113
She's Morvarid's teacher.

1239
01:23:40,114 --> 01:23:42,154
The child insisted on
her coming along.

1240
01:23:42,155 --> 01:23:43,514
She agreed. That's it.

1241
01:23:43,714 --> 01:23:46,913
But please,
be careful not to goof up!

1242
01:23:46,914 --> 01:23:49,634
What if she really hasn't drowned?

1243
01:23:50,194 --> 01:23:51,392
I just don't know anymore...

1244
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:52,714
Where's Sepideh?

1245
01:23:54,553 --> 01:23:55,513
She's with him.

1246
01:23:55,874 --> 01:23:57,312
Does she know everything?

1247
01:23:57,313 --> 01:23:59,393
Yes, I told her.

1248
01:23:59,793 --> 01:24:02,751
She's gently breaking it to him
that Elly drowned.

1249
01:24:02,752 --> 01:24:05,993
Look how a 20-year-old
gives us all the run-around!

1250
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:09,072
The children have to be kept quiet.

1251
01:24:09,432 --> 01:24:10,792
Where are they?

1252
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,872
Arash... Morvarid...

1253
01:24:20,272 --> 01:24:23,831
Children, sit down.
I have to tell you something.

1254
01:24:24,871 --> 01:24:27,070
Do you know why Elly
came with us?

1255
01:24:27,071 --> 01:24:30,910
To look after me
and keep me out of the sea.

1256
01:24:30,911 --> 01:24:32,950
- Bravo, that's it.
- No.

1257
01:24:33,431 --> 01:24:34,989
- Why then?
- Can I say it?

1258
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:37,510
To fall in love with you.

1259
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:39,710
With me?

1260
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:41,630
Who told you that?

1261
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:43,229
I saw it.

1262
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:46,108
You're wrong.
All that was a joke.

1263
01:24:46,109 --> 01:24:47,348
You heard that, sweetie?

1264
01:24:47,349 --> 01:24:51,188
That's why she was sad
and went home.

1265
01:24:51,189 --> 01:24:53,628
No, she wasn't sad at all.

1266
01:24:53,629 --> 01:24:56,828
She wanted to save Arash
and she drowned.

1267
01:24:56,829 --> 01:24:58,427
Is she still in the water?

1268
01:24:58,428 --> 01:25:00,668
Now, listen. Both of you.

1269
01:25:01,149 --> 01:25:03,548
Elly's brother is coming now,
understand?

1270
01:25:05,348 --> 01:25:08,347
He's a very serious man
and he's very angry.

1271
01:25:08,348 --> 01:25:10,028
You have to make a promise.

1272
01:25:10,787 --> 01:25:12,986
Be very careful

1273
01:25:12,987 --> 01:25:18,148
not to tell him anything
about our kidding around...

1274
01:25:18,507 --> 01:25:20,906
- What kidding?
- What Arash just said.

1275
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:23,426
We played and danced and laughed...

1276
01:25:23,427 --> 01:25:24,906
We played charades.

1277
01:25:25,227 --> 01:25:28,305
Right. You say nothing.

1278
01:25:28,306 --> 01:25:32,185
Even if he asks,
you say you don't know.

1279
01:25:32,186 --> 01:25:33,546
- We don't know.
- Very good.

1280
01:25:33,866 --> 01:25:35,786
Will you tell Anita, too?
Good.

1281
01:26:17,463 --> 01:26:19,062
Has she told him?

1282
01:26:23,222 --> 01:26:24,343
Don't go out.

1283
01:26:24,822 --> 01:26:27,062
Let's wait for Sepideh.

1284
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:03,379
Please, come in.

1285
01:27:04,499 --> 01:27:05,458
No, thanks.

1286
01:27:16,019 --> 01:27:17,938
Where did she fall into the water?

1287
01:27:21,299 --> 01:27:22,538
Over there.

1288
01:28:00,735 --> 01:28:03,815
- Let's go inside.
- Leave me alone for 5 minutes.

1289
01:28:38,453 --> 01:28:40,533
What a quiet kid.

1290
01:28:41,452 --> 01:28:44,491
She must have paid
for the harm she did him.

1291
01:28:44,492 --> 01:28:47,212
Otherwise,
it wouldn't have happened.

1292
01:28:48,052 --> 01:28:49,612
Here he is.

1293
01:29:23,849 --> 01:29:25,488
Do you want a sedative?

1294
01:29:25,489 --> 01:29:27,089
No. Where's the bathroom?

1295
01:29:29,249 --> 01:29:30,207
That way.

1296
01:29:47,728 --> 01:29:49,447
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1297
01:30:21,405 --> 01:30:23,045
Has he told her parents?

1298
01:30:25,765 --> 01:30:26,885
Not yet.

1299
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:29,845
Hadn't she told you about him?

1300
01:30:32,005 --> 01:30:32,964
Amir...

1301
01:30:57,763 --> 01:30:59,681
Shohreh, a towel, please.

1302
01:30:59,682 --> 01:31:03,281
No, thanks.
Is there a room where I can...

1303
01:31:03,282 --> 01:31:04,602
This room is cleaner.

1304
01:31:05,442 --> 01:31:07,161
Go ahead, please.

1305
01:31:11,001 --> 01:31:13,042
Can you bring a clean cloth?

1306
01:32:06,118 --> 01:32:07,837
There's no signal here.

1307
01:32:10,877 --> 01:32:14,237
But we were talking the other night
and we got cut off.

1308
01:32:14,517 --> 01:32:16,597
That must have been
when she went out.

1309
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:23,876
Excuse me...

1310
01:32:25,317 --> 01:32:26,716
just a moment.

1311
01:32:31,956 --> 01:32:33,995
Didn't she tell you
anything about me?

1312
01:32:36,235 --> 01:32:40,554
Yes, she did.
About you, her parents...

1313
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,155
What did she say?

1314
01:32:42,955 --> 01:32:45,914
That she missed you.

1315
01:32:46,235 --> 01:32:48,315
She praised you a lot.

1316
01:32:48,674 --> 01:32:50,314
She was worried about her mother.

1317
01:32:50,634 --> 01:32:54,874
I think her mother... your mother
has a heart problem, right?

1318
01:33:06,393 --> 01:33:07,352
Nazy...

1319
01:33:08,433 --> 01:33:10,153
- Excuse me.
- Come here.

1320
01:33:24,711 --> 01:33:28,391
He's not her brother.
Why did you say she missed him?

1321
01:33:28,392 --> 01:33:30,110
And she praised him?

1322
01:33:30,111 --> 01:33:31,431
I got nervous.

1323
01:33:31,832 --> 01:33:33,270
Didn't he get suspicious?

1324
01:33:33,271 --> 01:33:35,031
No... I don't know.

1325
01:33:56,149 --> 01:33:57,909
- You've not eaten...
- No, thanks.

1326
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:03,749
I have to call Tehran.

1327
01:34:03,949 --> 01:34:06,429
I'll take you
somewhere you can call from.

1328
01:34:30,547 --> 01:34:35,586
Leave the bedding I brought
for the newlyweds, I'll pick it up.

1329
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:36,747
Thanks.

1330
01:34:40,667 --> 01:34:44,787
Her poor husband was here earlier,
I didn't want to bother him.

1331
01:34:45,226 --> 01:34:47,746
- Whose husband?
- The drowned bride's.

1332
01:34:49,586 --> 01:34:51,626
Her husband was here earlier?

1333
01:34:59,186 --> 01:35:01,225
Madam, would you come here
for a second?

1334
01:35:04,024 --> 01:35:04,984
Peyman!

1335
01:35:06,224 --> 01:35:07,183
He found out!

1336
01:35:10,425 --> 01:35:12,143
The old woman came over.

1337
01:35:12,144 --> 01:35:14,822
She said the bedding
was for Elly and her husband.

1338
01:35:14,823 --> 01:35:16,024
Shit!

1339
01:35:16,864 --> 01:35:18,384
Shit!

1340
01:35:19,503 --> 01:35:20,622
Where is he?

1341
01:35:20,623 --> 01:35:21,863
I left.
I guess he's coming.

1342
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,222
Let's think of something.

1343
01:35:27,223 --> 01:35:28,582
Like what? It's over.

1344
01:35:28,583 --> 01:35:31,462
- Let's tell the truth.
- That we were hooking up his wife?

1345
01:35:31,463 --> 01:35:32,822
We didn't know
she was engaged.

1346
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:35,663
It's true. We didn't know.

1347
01:35:35,942 --> 01:35:38,102
The best thing to do
is to tell the truth.

1348
01:35:39,622 --> 01:35:40,661
What can we say?

1349
01:35:40,662 --> 01:35:42,621
That we didn't know
she was engaged.

1350
01:35:42,622 --> 01:35:45,741
Otherwise, we wouldn't have
introduced her to Ahmad.

1351
01:35:45,742 --> 01:35:47,501
Don't mention Ahmad.

1352
01:35:47,702 --> 01:35:49,341
Why else would she be here?

1353
01:35:49,342 --> 01:35:51,660
We'll have to tell the police, anyway.

1354
01:35:51,661 --> 01:35:53,622
Does he know
she was here for Ahmad?

1355
01:35:54,221 --> 01:35:56,380
He's no child.
He'll have guessed it all.

1356
01:35:56,381 --> 01:35:59,781
He must have got suspicious
even before coming here.

1357
01:36:00,741 --> 01:36:03,100
Why else would he say
he's her brother?

1358
01:36:03,901 --> 01:36:05,739
- Let's tell him.
- No, please.

1359
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:07,980
So what, Sepideh?
Shall we lie to him?

1360
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:10,739
We can't.

1361
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:12,298
He already knows it all.

1362
01:36:12,299 --> 01:36:14,540
We have no other choice, Sepideh.

1363
01:36:14,779 --> 01:36:18,058
- He'll find out.
- Elly will be disgraced.

1364
01:36:18,059 --> 01:36:20,418
Because of us?
She's dead now.

1365
01:36:20,419 --> 01:36:23,178
She came for a husband
while being engaged.

1366
01:36:23,179 --> 01:36:26,098
Which means:
1, she screwed all of us

1367
01:36:26,099 --> 01:36:27,818
2, she cheated on this poor guy.

1368
01:36:28,098 --> 01:36:29,577
Cheated?

1369
01:36:29,578 --> 01:36:32,777
What else?
Imagine you have a fiance

1370
01:36:32,778 --> 01:36:35,297
who finds someone better than you,

1371
01:36:35,298 --> 01:36:36,858
and they travel,
play volleyball...

1372
01:36:37,178 --> 01:36:38,537
What's wrong with that?

1373
01:36:38,538 --> 01:36:39,737
Don't you realize?

1374
01:36:39,738 --> 01:36:42,377
To you and me,
it seems perfectly right.

1375
01:36:42,378 --> 01:36:45,097
But from where he stands,
it seems all wrong.

1376
01:36:45,298 --> 01:36:47,296
From the alms she gave

1377
01:36:47,297 --> 01:36:49,057
to the cleaning she did here...

1378
01:36:49,257 --> 01:36:51,896
That was all a show to impress us.

1379
01:36:51,897 --> 01:36:53,576
Whatever.
What do we do now?

1380
01:36:55,417 --> 01:36:57,016
How could she dump
such a nice guy?

1381
01:36:57,377 --> 01:36:59,616
I felt so ashamed when I saw him.

1382
01:37:00,376 --> 01:37:02,535
The ululation the other night...

1383
01:37:02,536 --> 01:37:03,575
Hurry up now.

1384
01:37:03,576 --> 01:37:06,454
Ahmad, tell him we thought
she was single.

1385
01:37:06,455 --> 01:37:08,056
She had lied to us.

1386
01:37:08,296 --> 01:37:10,055
- We'll tell the truth.
- Please, don't.

1387
01:37:10,216 --> 01:37:12,894
Should we fool him
to save Elly's honor?

1388
01:37:12,895 --> 01:37:14,895
Does honor mean much
to the dead?

1389
01:37:15,775 --> 01:37:17,055
- I won't have it.
- Too late.

1390
01:37:18,095 --> 01:37:20,775
- Ahmad, don't let them...
- Peyman, come.

1391
01:37:40,574 --> 01:37:41,853
I knew.

1392
01:37:43,373 --> 01:37:44,332
She had told me.

1393
01:37:45,773 --> 01:37:48,213
I swear I'm not lying this time.

1394
01:37:48,572 --> 01:37:50,371
I swear on Morvarid's life.

1395
01:37:50,372 --> 01:37:53,932
I told Ahmad he wasn't her brother
but her fiance.

1396
01:37:56,012 --> 01:37:57,812
Ahmad, why don't you say anything?

1397
01:37:58,052 --> 01:37:59,972
We have no other choice.

1398
01:38:00,932 --> 01:38:02,211
I told her at the school

1399
01:38:02,212 --> 01:38:05,652
that a good friend of ours
visiting from Germany

1400
01:38:07,371 --> 01:38:09,571
had asked me to find him a wife.

1401
01:38:10,612 --> 01:38:13,490
She said she didn't want
to get married.

1402
01:38:13,491 --> 01:38:17,450
She'd been engaged for 2 years
and was trying to split up.

1403
01:38:17,451 --> 01:38:20,210
She didn't love him anymore
and he annoyed her.

1404
01:38:20,211 --> 01:38:25,090
Her family was also against him,
but he wouldn't let her be.

1405
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:30,689
I suggested she meet my friend
who wasn't staying long.

1406
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:33,489
She said she wouldn't
until the engagement was broken.

1407
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:37,568
I sent her photo to Ahmad.
You liked her, didn't you?

1408
01:38:37,569 --> 01:38:40,169
I carried on calling Elly
and insisting.

1409
01:38:44,489 --> 01:38:48,208
And what did she say...?
That she was determined to split up.

1410
01:38:49,608 --> 01:38:53,847
I said, once Ahmad left,
he wouldn't be back for a while.

1411
01:38:53,848 --> 01:38:56,687
It would be a pity
not to meet him once.

1412
01:38:56,688 --> 01:38:57,967
She kept saying no.

1413
01:38:58,288 --> 01:39:02,288
Finally, she agreed
to come with us secretly

1414
01:39:02,527 --> 01:39:04,607
for a single night.

1415
01:39:04,928 --> 01:39:06,487
She told me.

1416
01:39:12,206 --> 01:39:14,047
You may have insisted.

1417
01:39:14,726 --> 01:39:16,605
But did she have to come?

1418
01:39:16,606 --> 01:39:20,966
I begged her.
I said I had already planned it all.

1419
01:39:21,966 --> 01:39:22,925
My God!

1420
01:39:25,406 --> 01:39:27,605
Let's at least save her honor.

1421
01:39:28,926 --> 01:39:33,245
If we say we forced her to come
although we knew she was engaged,

1422
01:39:33,405 --> 01:39:34,406
will he believe us?

1423
01:39:34,725 --> 01:39:35,924
No way!

1424
01:39:35,925 --> 01:39:38,605
What difference
does it make anyway?

1425
01:39:38,804 --> 01:39:42,404
What she did was wrong.
She shouldn't have come.

1426
01:39:42,684 --> 01:39:43,965
She couldn't say no to me.

1427
01:39:44,764 --> 01:39:45,723
That's no reason.

1428
01:39:45,884 --> 01:39:49,243
Tell him the truth.
Say you knew nothing.

1429
01:39:49,244 --> 01:39:51,603
I'll say I knew.

1430
01:39:51,604 --> 01:39:55,524
This mess is my fault.
Come what may.

1431
01:39:56,003 --> 01:39:58,723
Are you nuts?
They'll kill you!

1432
01:39:59,003 --> 01:39:59,962
Too bad.

1433
01:39:59,963 --> 01:40:03,123
He sees us as a whole.

1434
01:40:03,483 --> 01:40:06,363
In his eyes, we're all accomplices.

1435
01:40:06,522 --> 01:40:09,521
I don't need any more complications.

1436
01:40:09,522 --> 01:40:11,842
Sepideh, be reasonable, for once.

1437
01:40:11,843 --> 01:40:15,722
This isn't about just you or me.
We must stick together.

1438
01:40:16,522 --> 01:40:17,481
Ahmad,

1439
01:40:17,962 --> 01:40:19,802
what do you think?

1440
01:40:22,281 --> 01:40:23,401
We tell him.

1441
01:40:24,002 --> 01:40:25,242
Let's tell the truth.

1442
01:40:25,562 --> 01:40:26,721
Let's tell him.

1443
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:28,721
And you, Manuchehr?

1444
01:40:29,081 --> 01:40:31,640
We really didn't know
she was engaged.

1445
01:40:31,641 --> 01:40:33,680
We found out too late.

1446
01:40:38,161 --> 01:40:39,360
And you, Shohreh?

1447
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,320
I can't bring myself
to lie to this poor boy.

1448
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,400
And you, Nazy?

1449
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:48,758
Whatever the majority says.

1450
01:40:48,759 --> 01:40:51,200
The majority seems to choose
the truth.

1451
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,639
We didn't know.

1452
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:54,958
I did.

1453
01:40:54,959 --> 01:40:57,719
You're the only one
and you're telling us just now!

1454
01:40:58,199 --> 01:40:59,158
Here he is.

1455
01:41:00,759 --> 01:41:03,479
Let's go all together.

1456
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:05,398
Peyman, watch out.

1457
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:07,878
Where are the kids? Arash?

1458
01:41:08,358 --> 01:41:10,878
Stay here, Sepideh.
Come, Nazy.

1459
01:41:12,118 --> 01:41:14,958
Please, don't make it
worse than it is...

1460
01:41:16,438 --> 01:41:18,397
What will he think of Elly?

1461
01:41:18,838 --> 01:41:20,997
Arash, Anita,

1462
01:41:22,318 --> 01:41:23,757
Morvarid, come here.

1463
01:41:45,636 --> 01:41:46,595
Ahmad!

1464
01:41:51,475 --> 01:41:52,955
Let me see, Ahmad!

1465
01:41:55,795 --> 01:41:56,435
Bastard!

1466
01:41:56,755 --> 01:41:58,274
Raise your head.

1467
01:41:59,155 --> 01:42:00,275
You're bleeding.

1468
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:08,753
Bring a Koran here,
so that I can swear

1469
01:42:08,754 --> 01:42:11,754
we didn't lie to you.

1470
01:42:12,713 --> 01:42:14,592
I swear on my children!

1471
01:42:14,593 --> 01:42:15,713
Come on,

1472
01:42:16,033 --> 01:42:17,553
why should we lie to you?

1473
01:42:17,874 --> 01:42:20,232
We came here
with our wives and kids.

1474
01:42:20,233 --> 01:42:24,352
Why would we bring an engaged girl
to introduce her to our friend?

1475
01:42:24,353 --> 01:42:26,111
Are we crazy?

1476
01:42:26,112 --> 01:42:29,591
If we'd had the slightest doubt,
we'd never...

1477
01:42:29,592 --> 01:42:31,712
What's this argument all about?

1478
01:42:31,713 --> 01:42:32,912
- Let's sit down.
- You shut up!

1479
01:42:33,233 --> 01:42:34,511
Shut your mouth!

1480
01:42:34,512 --> 01:42:36,552
- Stop it!
- Go inside, Ahmad!

1481
01:42:37,231 --> 01:42:38,352
What the hell?

1482
01:42:39,192 --> 01:42:41,872
We've been going through hell
for 2 days!

1483
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:43,472
We haven't eaten a thing!
And you...

1484
01:42:44,192 --> 01:42:45,951
I'm not asking anything.

1485
01:42:46,271 --> 01:42:48,270
Just tell me the truth.

1486
01:42:48,271 --> 01:42:51,790
I offered to call the police
so you could see the report.

1487
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:54,030
I don't care about the police.

1488
01:42:54,031 --> 01:42:57,910
We may lie to you
but we can't lie to the police.

1489
01:42:57,911 --> 01:42:59,429
Forget the police!

1490
01:42:59,430 --> 01:43:00,750
It has to be done legally!

1491
01:43:01,071 --> 01:43:03,309
- Was I talking to you?
- One moment.

1492
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,550
Come here, Shohreh.

1493
01:43:12,909 --> 01:43:14,869
Who invited Elly here?

1494
01:43:17,589 --> 01:43:18,669
My wife.

1495
01:43:19,549 --> 01:43:22,309
- They see each other at school.
- Where is she?

1496
01:43:22,788 --> 01:43:23,747
Inside.

1497
01:43:23,829 --> 01:43:25,469
I want to speak to her.

1498
01:43:26,989 --> 01:43:29,067
Sepideh is feeling very bad.

1499
01:43:29,068 --> 01:43:30,868
Worse than me?

1500
01:43:32,028 --> 01:43:33,067
She's asleep.

1501
01:43:33,068 --> 01:43:35,187
We've told you everything.

1502
01:43:35,188 --> 01:43:37,907
There's a question
I want to ask her.

1503
01:43:37,908 --> 01:43:39,226
Let's go to the police.

1504
01:43:39,227 --> 01:43:41,027
We'll go.

1505
01:43:41,427 --> 01:43:44,586
- I want to ask her...
- She's just fallen asleep.

1506
01:43:44,587 --> 01:43:48,307
Don't worry. I won't feel any worse
than I already do.

1507
01:43:54,146 --> 01:43:55,306
Where is she?

1508
01:43:56,026 --> 01:43:57,106
Madam!

1509
01:43:59,306 --> 01:44:00,266
Wait here.

1510
01:44:00,826 --> 01:44:01,866
I'll get her.

1511
01:44:02,026 --> 01:44:05,386
Shohreh, call Sepideh.

1512
01:44:08,025 --> 01:44:10,465
I want to talk to her alone.

1513
01:44:12,425 --> 01:44:13,385
Shohreh!

1514
01:44:26,024 --> 01:44:28,583
He's not a guy
you can say everything to.

1515
01:44:31,583 --> 01:44:33,703
He bashed up Ahmad's nose.

1516
01:44:35,463 --> 01:44:37,343
I'm not against you.

1517
01:44:42,022 --> 01:44:43,463
I beg you, Sepideh,

1518
01:44:45,462 --> 01:44:46,422
get up.

1519
01:44:47,822 --> 01:44:50,623
Go and wash your face
so I can bring him in.

1520
01:44:50,982 --> 01:44:52,102
Get up, dear.

1521
01:45:43,819 --> 01:45:45,858
Did you ask her to come along?

1522
01:45:47,578 --> 01:45:49,178
Yes, I did.

1523
01:45:54,177 --> 01:45:55,457
May I sit down?

1524
01:45:55,458 --> 01:45:58,976
When you asked her
to meet your friend,

1525
01:45:58,977 --> 01:45:59,977
didn't she say anything?

1526
01:46:05,497 --> 01:46:08,257
Can I first say something?

1527
01:46:08,976 --> 01:46:11,137
- Elly...
- Listen...

1528
01:46:12,777 --> 01:46:16,056
I just want to know one thing...

1529
01:46:16,376 --> 01:46:17,376
Sit down.

1530
01:46:22,216 --> 01:46:23,935
Yes or no?

1531
01:46:25,055 --> 01:46:26,855
- When you told her...
- But...

1532
01:46:27,935 --> 01:46:29,934
...didn't she say no?

1533
01:46:29,935 --> 01:46:33,215
Didn't she say she had someone,
a fiance?

1534
01:46:34,175 --> 01:46:35,655
Did she or didn't she?

1535
01:46:36,574 --> 01:46:38,174
She really...

1536
01:46:39,574 --> 01:46:41,534
She really...

1537
01:46:42,094 --> 01:46:45,054
Listen, this is very important to me.

1538
01:46:45,374 --> 01:46:48,733
I dedicated
3 years of my life to her.

1539
01:46:49,133 --> 01:46:51,574
Could you please sit down, too?

1540
01:46:59,613 --> 01:47:01,332
Didn't she refuse?

1541
01:47:06,012 --> 01:47:07,493
Did she or didn't she?

1542
01:47:10,332 --> 01:47:12,972
No, she didn't.

1543
01:48:04,008 --> 01:48:05,369
Alireza,

1544
01:48:05,928 --> 01:48:08,328
the police called.

1545
01:48:08,807 --> 01:48:11,167
It seems that earlier today

1546
01:48:12,608 --> 01:48:15,287
they found the body of a woman
in the sea.

1547
01:48:16,167 --> 01:48:18,007
We must go and identify her.

1548
01:48:21,407 --> 01:48:23,287
They've called on the landline.

1549
01:48:26,567 --> 01:48:27,567
Amir!

1550
01:48:36,245 --> 01:48:38,164
Take Elly's bag.

1551
01:48:38,165 --> 01:48:39,326
Please...

1552
01:48:41,205 --> 01:48:43,486
Wait. We'll go with you.

1553
01:48:53,045 --> 01:48:54,524
Don't be afraid.
Is this her?

1554
01:49:32,242 --> 01:49:33,721
My condolences.

1555
01:49:44,561 --> 01:49:46,241
Give me my car keys.

1556
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:52,161
Can you call the family
and inform them?

1557
01:49:52,162 --> 01:49:53,561
You call them.

1558
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,880
Wouldn't it be better if you did?

1559
01:53:19,825 --> 01:53:21,305
