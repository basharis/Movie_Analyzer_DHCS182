1
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,690
There are more than yesterday.

2
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,340
He will be saying prayers in
the garden. Just follow the others.

3
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,400
He will be saying prayers in
the garden. Just follow the others.

4
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,810
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

5
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,590
Oh, God!

6
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,120
The object of this massive tribute...

7
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,370
...died as he had always lived:

8
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,620
A private man...

9
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,940
...without wealth...

10
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,580
...without property...

11
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,290
...without official title or office.

12
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,790
Mahatma Gandhi...

13
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
...was not the commander of armies...

14
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,630
...nor a ruler of vast lands.

15
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,830
He could not boast
any scientific achievement...

16
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,800
...or artistic gift.

17
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,250
Yet men...

18
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,230
...governments, dignitaries
from all over the world...

19
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,350
...have joined hands today
to pay homage...

20
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,230
...to this little brown man
in the loincloth...

21
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,320
...who led his country to freedom.

22
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,530
In the words of
General George C. Marshall...

23
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,810
...the American secretary of state:

24
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,250
"Mahatma Gandhi has become
the spokesman...

25
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,370
...for the conscience of all mankind.

26
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,170
He was a man...

27
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,880
...who made humility...

28
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,710
...and simple truth...

29
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,970
...more powerful than empires."

30
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,130
And Albert Einstein added:

31
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,010
"Generations to come will scarce
believe that such a one as this...

32
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,390
...ever in flesh and blood...

33
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,430
...walked upon this earth."

34
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,860
Tell me...

35
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,530
...do you think about hell?

36
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,690
No, neither do I.

37
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,990
But this man here...

38
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,620
...is a Christian, and he's written
that in order to believe--

39
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,900
Excuse me, sir.

40
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,580
How long have you been
in South Africa?

41
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,920
A week.

42
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,590
I don't know how you got a ticket.

43
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,630
Just what are you doing
in this car, coolie?

44
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,680
Why, I have a ticket.

45
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,180
A first-class ticket.

46
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,020
-How did you get it?
-I sent for it in the post.

47
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,520
I'm an attorney.
I didn't--

48
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,930
There are no coloured attorneys
in South Africa.

49
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,360
Sit where you belong!

50
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,720
I'll take your luggage back, sir.

51
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,860
Just a moment, please.

52
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,820
You see?

53
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,530
Mohandas K. Gandhi, attorney at law.

54
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,870
I'm going to conduct a case
for an Indian trading firm.

55
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,790
Didn't you hear me? There are no
coloured attorneys in South Africa.

56
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,370
I was called to the bar in London...

57
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,840
...and enrolled at
the High Court of Chancery.

58
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,970
I am, therefore, an attorney.

59
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,710
And since I am,
in your eyes, coloured...

60
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,220
...I think we can deduce
that there is at least...

61
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,310
...one coloured attorney
in South Africa.

62
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,480
Smart bloody Kaffir!

63
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,760
Throw him out.

64
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,340
Just move your black ass
back to third class...

65
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,980
...or I'll have you thrown off
at the next station.

66
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,980
But I always go first class!

67
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,560
But you're a rich man.
Why put up with it?

68
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,170
Yes, I am rich. But I am Indian.

69
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,720
I do not expect
to travel first class.

70
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,350
-In England, I was a poor student.
-That was England.

71
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,230
This is part of England's Empire.

72
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,200
Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and
you see a successful Muslim trader.

73
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,240
Most South Africans see him
simply as an Indian.

74
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,190
And the vast majority of Indians,
mostly Hindus, like yourself...

75
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,370
...were brought here to
work mines and harvest crops.

76
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,080
Most Europeans don't want them
doing anything else.

77
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,710
But that is very unchristian--

78
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,170
Mr. Gandhi, in this country...

79
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,210
...Indians are not allowed to walk
along the pavement with a Christian.

80
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,390
You mean, you employ Mr. Baker
as your attorney...

81
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,220
...but you can't walk down
the street with him?

82
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,970
Well, I can.

83
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,440
But I risk being kicked
into the gutter by someone...

84
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,270
...less holy than Mr. Baker.

85
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,240
Well, then it must be fought.

86
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,820
We are children of God
like everyone else.

87
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,320
Allah be praised!

88
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,040
And what battalions
will you call upon?

89
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,970
I will write to the press...

90
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,420
...here and in England.

91
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,000
I will use the courts.

92
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,670
You'll cause a lot of trouble.
Our position is--

93
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,460
We are members of the Empire.

94
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,690
And we come from
an ancient civilization.

95
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,530
Why should we not walk on
the pavements like other men?

96
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,820
I rather like the idea of
an Indian barrister in South Africa.

97
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,110
I'm sure our community could
keep you in work for some time...

98
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,080
...even if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

99
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,070
Especially if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

100
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,650
There's the English reporter.
I told you he'd come.

101
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,100
You also said your article
would draw a thousand people.

102
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,990
At least some of the Hindus
brought their wives.

103
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,820
No, I asked my wife
to organize that.

104
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,790
Some of them are leaving.

105
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,510
"Ladies and gentlemen:

106
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,930
We have asked you to gather here
to help us proclaim our right...

107
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,310
...to be treated as equal citizens
of the Empire.

108
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,600
We do not seek conflict.

109
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,810
We know the strength of
the forces arrayed against us...

110
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,900
...know that because of them,
we can only use peaceful means.

111
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,450
But we are determined
that justice will be done.

112
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,830
The symbol of our status
is embodied in this pass...

113
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,360
...which we must carry
at all times...

114
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,460
...but which no European
even has to have.

115
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,550
The first step towards
changing our status...

116
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,930
...is to eliminate
this difference between us."

117
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,180
Now?

118
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,780
You write brilliantly, but you have
much to learn about handling men.

119
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
"We do not want to ignite...

120
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,940
...the fear or hatred of anyone.

121
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,900
But we ask you...

122
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,370
...Hindu, Muslim and Sikh...

123
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,420
...to help us light up the sky...

124
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,960
...and the minds of
the British authorities...

125
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,340
...with our defiance
of this injustice."

126
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,560
We will now burn the passes of
our committee and its supporters.

127
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,940
We ask you to put
your passes on the fire--

128
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,480
You bloody dog!

129
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,570
Those passes...

130
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,160
...are government property!

131
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,660
And I will arrest the first man
who tries to burn one!

132
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,550
Take him away.

133
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,640
You little...

134
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,270
...Sammy...

135
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,770
...bastard!

136
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,280
Now! Are there any more?

137
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,710
If you want this kind of trouble,
you can have it.

138
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,820
Let me go!

139
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,860
Let me go!

140
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,080
Stop.

141
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,640
The London papers have
arrived from the Cape.

142
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,280
The worst was the Daily Mail.

143
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,820
They said the burning of passes--

144
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,160
-Ask Mr. Herzog to see me.
---was the most significant act...

145
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,620
...in colonial affairs since
the Declaration of Independence.

146
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,120
They'll find we're better
prepared this time.

147
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,500
Mr. Gandhi will find
he's on a long hiding to nothing.

148
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,090
"A High Court judge confirmed
that Mr. Gandhi...

149
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,720
...would've been within his rights
to prosecute for assault...

150
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,050
...since neither he nor Mr. Khan
resisted arrest."

151
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,020
I told you about English law.

152
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,190
As I told you about English policemen.

153
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,480
Yes?

154
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,400
We're very pleased
to have you back, Papa.

155
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,900
And I am glad to be back.

156
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,940
Come.

157
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,530
Mind your face.

158
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,290
Tomorrow I'll tell you about
my days in a police hospital.

159
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,910
Come, come.

160
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,050
Just like proper English gentlemen.
I'm proud of them.

161
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,560
They're boys and they're Indian.

162
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,390
Will you take this off?
It pinches every time I speak.

163
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,110
I've got it.

164
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,120
You'd be Gandhi.

165
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,210
I thought you'd be bigger.

166
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,920
-I'm sorry.
-No, that's all right.

167
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,050
My name is Charlie Andrews, sir.

168
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,540
I've come from India.

169
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,350
I've read a great deal about you.

170
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,510
Some of it good, I hope.

171
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,980
Would you care to walk?

172
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,060
You're a clergyman?

173
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,190
I met some remarkable people in India.

174
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,440
And when I read what you were doing,
I wanted to help.

175
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,570
-Does that surprise you?
-Not anymore.

176
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,570
At first, I was amazed...

177
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,480
...but when you're fighting
in a just cause...

178
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,040
...people seem to pop up, like you,
right out of the pavement.

179
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,170
Even when it's dangerous or...

180
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,880
Hey, look what's coming!

181
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,300
A white shepherd leading
a brown Sammy!

182
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,140
Perhaps we should...

183
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,930
Doesn't the New Testament say:

184
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,590
"If your enemy strikes you on
the right cheek, offer him the left"?

185
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,350
The phrase was used metaphorically.
I don't think our Lord--

186
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,810
I'm not so sure.

187
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,480
I have thought about it a great deal.

188
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,730
I suspect He meant
you must show courage...

189
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,070
...be willing to take a blow,
several blows, to show...

190
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,950
...you won't strike back,
nor will you be turned aside.

191
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,080
And when you do that, it calls on
something in human nature...

192
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,900
...that makes his hatred for you
decrease and his respect increase.

193
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,460
I think Christ grasped that,
and I have seen it work.

194
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
Good morning.

195
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,500
Get off the pavement,
you bloody coon.

196
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,040
-Yeah, get off.
-Kaffir!

197
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,340
Colin, what you doing?

198
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,460
Nothing.

199
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,560
Come out where I can see you!

200
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,810
I said, what you doing?

201
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,070
We were just trying
to clean up the neighbourhood.

202
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,650
You're late for work.
I thought you'd gone 10 minutes ago.

203
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,650
Get on!

204
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,790
You'll find there's room for us all.

205
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,170
-That was lucky.
-I thought you were a man of God.

206
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,510
I am, but I'm not
so egotistical as to think...

207
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,640
...He plans His day
around my dilemmas.

208
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,980
You could call it
a communal farm, I suppose.

209
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,680
But you've all come
to the same conclusions.

210
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,440
Our Gita, the Muslim's Koran,
your Bible.

211
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,860
It's always the simple things
that catch your breath.

212
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,440
"Love thy neighbour as thyself."

213
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,610
Not always practised...

214
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,200
...but it's something we Hindus
could learn a lot from.

215
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,120
That's the kind of thing
you'll be seeking on this farm?

216
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,790
Well, we shall try.

217
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,870
Bad news, I'm afraid.

218
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,790
They're going to change the pass laws.

219
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,540
It's taken time...

220
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,050
...but it needed to be done fairly.

221
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,680
We didn't want to create an injustice
simply because Mr. Gandhi...

222
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,460
...was abusing our
existing legislation.

223
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,270
Just one moment, sir, please.

224
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,440
I beg your pardon.

225
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,560
But on a short trip...

226
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,700
...I wouldn't spend too much time
on the Indian question, Mr. Walker.

227
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,700
It's a tiny factor
in South Africa.

228
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,330
Well, it is news at the moment.

229
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,330
I plan to report on
the condition of the mines here...

230
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,960
-...as well as the economy.
-Good.

231
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,960
But I would like to meet
this Mr. Gand-eye.

232
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,710
Gandhi.

233
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,180
Of course.
We Westerners have a weakness...

234
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,260
...for these spiritually inclined
men of India.

235
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,380
But as an old lawyer,
let me warn you.

236
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,560
Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man
as you will ever meet...

237
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,440
...however otherworldly he may seem.

238
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,570
But I'm sure you're enough
of a reporter to see that.

239
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,570
I hope so.
Thank you for your time, sir.

240
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,660
So it's not spiritualism
or nationalism.

241
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,080
We're not resisting anything but the
idea that people can't live together.

242
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,490
You see?

243
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,090
Hindus, Muslims...

244
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,210
...Sikhs, Jews...

245
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,010
...even Christians.

246
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,720
Mr. Walker of the New York Times.

247
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,870
How you doing?

248
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,720
Without a paper,
a journal of some kind...

249
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,810
...you cannot unite a community.

250
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,140
You belong to a
very important profession.

251
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,180
And what do you think an important
professional should write...

252
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,940
...about your response to
General Smuts' newest legislation?

253
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,950
I don't know.

254
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,490
I'm still searching for a response.

255
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,540
You will respect the law?

256
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,130
There are unjust laws
as there are unjust men.

257
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,550
You're a small minority to take on
the South African government...

258
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,340
...not to mention the British Empire.

259
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,970
If you are a minority of one...

260
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,580
...the truth is the truth.

261
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,710
Herman Kallenbach...

262
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,930
...our chief carpenter,
also our chief benefactor.

263
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,850
Vince Walker, New York Times.

264
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,020
This is quite a place
you've got here.

265
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,230
And you call it an ashram?

266
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,360
That's right.
The word only means "community."

267
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,870
But it could stand for
"village" or "the world."

268
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,360
You're an ambitious man, Mr. Gandhi.

269
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,290
I hope not.

270
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,120
I hear that you also prepare
the meals and clean the toilets.

271
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,090
-Is that part of the experiment?
-Ba!

272
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,840
We will need another place set
for Mr. Walker's driver.

273
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,260
I will tell Tara.

274
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,980
Yes, it's one way to learn
that each man's labour...

275
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,940
...is as important as another's.

276
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,360
While you're doing it,
cleaning the toilet...

277
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,820
...seems far more important
than the law.

278
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,030
Please, come and join us.

279
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,030
You'll need something before
your journey back.

280
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,450
-Would you excuse me, please?
-Yeah, sure.

281
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,920
What is it?

282
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,630
Sora was sent to tell me I must...

283
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,090
...rake and cover the latrine.

284
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,460
That's right.

285
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,510
Everyone takes their turn.

286
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,140
It is the work of untouchables!

287
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,270
In this place,
there are no untouchables...

288
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,390
...and no work is beneath any of us.

289
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,340
I'm your wife!

290
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,310
All the more reason.

291
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,610
As you command.

292
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,950
The others may follow you,
but you forget...

293
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,620
...I knew you when you were a boy.

294
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,410
It's not me.

295
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,120
It's the principle.

296
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,040
And you will do it with joy
or not do it at all.

297
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,960
Not at all then.

298
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,010
All right then, go.
You don't belong here!

299
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,060
Go and leave the ashram altogether.
We don't want you!

300
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,010
Have you no shame?

301
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,690
I'm your wife!

302
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,110
Where do you expect me to go?

303
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,870
What's the matter with me?

304
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,130
You're human.

305
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,010
Only human.

306
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,600
And it's even harder
for those of us...

307
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,560
...who do not even want to be
as good as you do.

308
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,070
I apologize.

309
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,780
I must get back to that reporter.

310
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,080
And I must...

311
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,290
...rake and cover the latrine.

312
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,570
I want to welcome you all.

313
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,780
Every one of you.

314
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,370
We have no secrets.

315
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,500
Let us begin by being clear...

316
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,460
...about General Smuts' new law.

317
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,590
All Indians must now
be fingerprinted...

318
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,750
...like criminals.

319
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,760
Men and women.

320
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,020
No marriage other than a Christian
marriage is considered valid.

321
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,770
Under this act...

322
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,770
...our wives and mothers are whores.

323
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,650
And every man here is a bastard.

324
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,570
He has become quite good at this.

325
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,370
And a policeman...

326
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,870
...passing an Indian dwelling...

327
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,960
...I will not call them homes...

328
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,130
...may enter and demand the card of any
Indian woman whose dwelling it is.

329
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
Goddamn them!

330
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,930
Understand...

331
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,890
...he does not have to
stand at the door.

332
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,510
He may enter.

333
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,050
I will not allow it!

334
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,060
I swear to Allah.

335
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,780
I'll kill the man who offers
that insult to my home and my wife...

336
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,690
...and let them hang me!

337
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,830
I say: Talk means nothing!

338
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:51,620
Kill a few officials before
they disgrace one Indian woman.

339
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,450
Then they might think twice
about such laws.

340
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,720
In that cause,
I would be willing to die!

341
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,890
I praise such courage.

342
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,900
I need such courage...

343
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,400
...because, in this cause,
I too am prepared to die.

344
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,110
But, my friend...

345
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,490
...there is no cause for which
I am prepared to kill.

346
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,330
Whatever they do to us...

347
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,540
...we will attack no one...

348
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,710
...kill no one.

349
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,790
But we will not give
our fingerprints, not one of us.

350
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,760
They will imprison us. They will fine
us. They will seize our possessions.

351
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,260
But they cannot take away
our self-respect...

352
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,970
...if we do not give it to them.

353
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,220
Have you been to prison?

354
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,680
They beat us and torture us.
I say--

355
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,980
I am asking you to fight.

356
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,860
To fight against their anger,
not to provoke it.

357
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,990
We will not strike a blow.

358
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,150
But we will receive them.

359
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,870
And through our pain...

360
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,500
...we will make them see
their injustice.

361
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,370
And it will hurt...

362
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,000
...as all fighting hurts.

363
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,510
But we cannot lose.

364
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,840
We cannot.

365
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,100
They may torture my body...

366
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,960
...break my bones...

367
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,850
...even kill me.

368
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,390
Then...

369
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,480
...they will have my dead body...

370
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,020
...not my obedience.

371
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,920
We are Hindu and Muslim...

372
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,510
...children of God, each one of us.

373
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,520
Let us take a solemn oath
in His name...

374
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,350
...that, come what may...

375
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,900
...we will not submit to this law.

376
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,610
God save our gracious King

377
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,950
God save our noble King

378
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,200
God save our King

379
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,770
These men are contracted labourers.

380
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,350
They belong in the mines.

381
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,010
You put their comrades in jail.

382
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,060
When you free them...

383
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,610
...they will go back to work.

384
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,860
I've warned you.

385
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,150
We've warned each other.

386
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,080
I don't think that's very good.

387
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,330
Steady, steady.

388
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,700
Stop!

389
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,600
At the canter, charge!

390
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,650
We should lie down.

391
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,730
Down!

392
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,730
The horses won't trample on us.
Lie down!

393
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,030
Follow me! Follow me!

394
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,930
Now what the hell do we do?

395
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,220
Let them march.

396
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,520
In our own sweet time,
in our own sweet way...

397
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,520
...we'll get them.

398
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,030
One law!

399
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,150
One king!

400
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,430
One law!

401
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,900
One king!

402
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,750
Some of you may be rejoicing that
Mr. Gandhi has been put into prison.

403
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,660
But I would ask you, assembled
here in this house of God...

404
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,840
...to recognize that we are
witnessing something new...

405
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,300
...something so unexpected,
so unusual...

406
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,300
...that it is not surprising
the government is at a loss.

407
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,420
What Mr. Gandhi has forced us to do...

408
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,310
...is ask questions about ourselves.

409
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,730
As Christians, those are
difficult questions to answer.

410
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,410
How do we treat men
who defy an unjust law...

411
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,370
...who will not fight...

412
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,200
...but will not comply?

413
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,750
As Christians, or as people
who have not heard the word--

414
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,140
They're sparing no one, I see.

415
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,350
No, you were the surprise.

416
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,600
It has been all over the prison.

417
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,180
We thought they'd be too afraid
of the English press.

418
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,150
So did I.

419
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,580
I don't know who they've
left out there to do the work.

420
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,950
Have they touched the women?

421
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,500
My wife publicly defied the law.
They've arrested her and four others.

422
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,630
It split the government.

423
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,330
Well, that's one victory.

424
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,090
If we hold firm,
it won't be the last.

425
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,390
Don't worry.

426
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,430
I've never seen men so determined.

427
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,980
You have given them a way to fight.

428
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,220
Gandhi!

429
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,280
I want Gandhi!

430
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,450
Which Sammy is it?

431
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,200
Mr. Gandhi.

432
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,270
I thought we might have
a little talk.

433
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,410
Thank you, Daniels.

434
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,670
Will you have a glass of sherry?

435
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,840
Thank you, no.

436
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,210
Perhaps some tea?

437
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,340
I dined at the prison.

438
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,590
Please, do come and sit down.

439
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,190
I've more or less decided to ask
the House to repeal the act...

440
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,900
...that you have taken
such exception to.

441
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,710
Well, if you asked, General Smuts,
I'm sure it will be done.

442
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,210
It's not quite that simple.

443
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,500
Somehow, I expected not.

444
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,510
I thought of calling for
a royal commission...

445
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,920
...to investigate the new legislation.

446
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,180
I think I could guarantee they would
recommend the act be repealed.

447
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,390
I congratulate them.

448
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,190
But they might also recommend...

449
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,730
...that all future Indian immigration
be severely restricted...

450
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,150
...even stopped.

451
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:36,660
Immigration was not an issue
on which we fought.

452
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:40,210
It would be wrong of us
to make it one, now that we...

453
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,300
We are in a position of advantage.

454
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,760
I'm ordering the release of all
prisoners within the next 24 hours.

455
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,600
You yourself are free
as from this moment.

456
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,690
Assuming we are in agreement.

457
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,110
Yes, yes.

458
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,910
It's just that in these clothes,
I would prefer to go by taxi.

459
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,290
All right. Fine.

460
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,120
I'm afraid I have no money.

461
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,880
Neither have I.

462
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,380
I'm awfully sorry.

463
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,800
Daniels...

464
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,180
...will you lend Mr. Gandhi
a shilling for a taxi?

465
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,470
I beg your pardon, sir?

466
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,600
How far will you be going, Gandhi?

467
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:43,400
Now that this is settled, I'd thought
seriously of going back to India.

468
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,480
But a shilling will do splendidly
for the moment.

469
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,110
Thank you.

470
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels...

471
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,830
...but I can find my own way out.

472
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,400
Guard of honour!

473
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,320
Guard of honour!

474
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,360
Attention!

475
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,910
Present arms!

476
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,130
-My God, he loves it!
-I'm sure he hates it.

477
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,600
Generals' reputations are
being made in France today...

478
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,470
...fighting on the Western front.

479
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,690
Not as military governors in India.

480
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,480
What the devil's going on back there?

481
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,440
Must be that Indian who made
all that fuss in Africa.

482
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,610
My cabin boy told me he was onboard.

483
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,200
There he is.

484
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,030
God, he's dressed like a coolie!

485
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,830
I thought he was a lawyer.

486
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,610
Mr. Gandhi, have you refused
to wear European clothes?

487
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,460
No, I haven't refused.

488
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,800
I simply wanted to dress the way
my comrades in prison dress.

489
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,760
Will you support the war effort?

490
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:38,790
If I wish to enjoy the benefits
and protection of the British Empire...

491
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,560
...it would be wrong of me
not to help in its defence.

492
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,980
Now that you're back in India,
what will you do?

493
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,510
I don't know.

494
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,520
-I don't know.
-One more question.

495
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,470
As an Indian woman, how could you
accept the indignity of prison?

496
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,740
My dignity comes
from following my husband.

497
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,270
Thank you very much.

498
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,910
Just a few words, then we'll
get you to civilization.

499
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,280
May I?

500
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,510
I'm glad to be home...

501
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,980
...and I thank you for your greeting.

502
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,110
I'll follow with your wife.

503
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,080
Don't worry.
Everything's arranged.

504
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,250
Who's that young man?

505
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,790
That's young Nehru.

506
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,580
He's got his father's intellect,
his mother's good looks...

507
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,260
...and the devil's own charm.

508
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:06,050
If they don't ruin him at Cambridge--
Wave, wave!

509
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,230
He might amount to something.

510
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:18,610
I must say, when I first saw you as
a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay...

511
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,070
...I never thought I'd greet you
as a national hero.

512
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,200
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

513
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,080
Yes, you are!

514
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,200
It's been 200 years
since an Indian cocked a snook...

515
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,700
...at the British Empire
and got away with it.

516
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,630
And stop calling me Mr. Patel.
You're not a junior clerk anymore.

517
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:04,700
The new military governor of the
Northwest Province was on that ship.

518
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,200
Too bad you came back third class.

519
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,870
He might have been impressed...

520
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,570
...by a successful barrister
who'd outmaneuvered General Smuts.

521
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,540
Yes, I'm sure.

522
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,020
Are you involved too, Mrs. Nehru?

523
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,470
No. I leave practical matters
to my husband...

524
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,020
...and revolution to my son.

525
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:40,180
Mr. Gandhi, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Jinnah, our joint host...

526
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,450
...member of congress and leader
of the Muslim League...

527
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,030
How do you do?

528
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,410
And Mr. Prakash, who, I fear...

529
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,950
...is awaiting trial for sedition
and inducement to murder.

530
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,570
I have not actually pulled
the trigger, Mr. Gandhi.

531
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,030
I have simply written...

532
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,590
...if an Englishman kills an Indian
for disobeying his law...

533
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,760
...it is an Indian's duty
to kill an Englishman...

534
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,550
...for enforcing his law
in a land that is not his.

535
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,430
It's a clever argument. It may not
produce the end you desire.

536
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,020
We hope you'll join us in our
struggle for home rule, Mr. Gandhi.

537
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:16,270
Excuse me. May l, Mohan?
There's someone I'd like him to meet.

538
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,550
Excuse me.

539
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,400
Sorry to rush you.

540
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,320
He told the press
he'd support the British in the war.

541
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,240
That's nonviolence for you.

542
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:29,980
You know, Mohan...

543
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,740
...now I have a confession to make.

544
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,700
I didn't decide to come
to South Africa.

545
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,920
Professor Gokhale sent me.

546
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:42,050
We are trying
to make a nation, Gandhi.

547
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,970
But the British keep trying
to break us up...

548
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,930
...into religions,
principalities, provinces.

549
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,250
What you were writing
in South Africa...

550
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,020
...that's what we need here.

551
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,480
I have so much to learn about India.

552
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,640
And I have to begin my practice again.
One needs money to run a journal.

553
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,240
Nonsense. Go on, Charlie.
This is Indian talk.

554
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,410
We want none of you imperialists here.

555
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,410
All right, I'll go
and write my report to the viceroy.

556
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,070
You go and find a pretty Hindu woman...

557
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,210
...and convert her to Christianity.

558
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,210
That's as much mischief
as you're allowed.

559
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,330
Come, let's find a quiet corner.

560
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,300
Now, you forget about your practice.

561
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,590
You have other things to do.

562
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:34,000
India has many men
with too much wealth.

563
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:38,380
And it's their privilege to nourish
the effort of the few...

564
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,480
...who can raise India
from servitude and apathy.

565
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,400
I'll see to it.

566
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,190
You begin your journal.

567
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,700
I have little to say.

568
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,780
Come, let's sit down.

569
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,030
India is an alien country to me.

570
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:53,660
Change that.

571
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,110
Go and find India.

572
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,750
Not what you see here...

573
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,530
...but the real India.

574
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,620
You'll see what needs to be said...

575
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,620
...what we need to hear.

576
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,510
When I saw you in that tunic, I knew.

577
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,440
I knew I could die in peace.

578
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,650
Make India proud of herself.

579
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:55,110
Charlie, please.
You're both being foolish.

580
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,400
But the air is lovely.
Anyway, there's no room in there.

581
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,150
Please! Come in.

582
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,160
No violence, please.

583
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:06,700
Let me hang on with two hands
or I will fall.

584
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,240
Englishman, sahib!

585
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,370
Come, there is room up here!

586
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,500
Put your foot on the window.

587
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,040
Come!

588
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:26,180
-What are you doing?
-I'm going nearer to God.

589
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,140
Charlie! Be careful!

590
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,560
Let go. Let go!

591
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:35,110
-Let go!
-Oh, dear!

592
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:48,780
Hello.

593
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,750
You see?
It is most comfortable.

594
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,380
Sahib?

595
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,620
Are you a Christian?

596
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:00,090
Yes, I'm a Christian.

597
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,880
I know a Christian.

598
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,550
She drinks blood.

599
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,810
Blood of Christ. Every Sunday.

600
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:13,190
Charlie!

601
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,780
It's all right, sahib.
It's very safe.

602
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,850
Bend!

603
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:29,330
Pray to God, sahib.
Now is when it is best to be Hindu.

604
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,290
I agree with Jinnah.

605
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:36,490
Now that the Americans are in,
the war will be over soon.

606
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,160
The Germans are worn out as it is.

607
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,720
And our first act should be...

608
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,010
...to convene
a congress party convention...

609
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,720
...and demand independence.

610
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:51,140
And we will speak
with one voice, united.

611
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,520
And we should invite Gandhi.

612
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,520
What the devil's happened to him?

613
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,900
He's discovering India.

614
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,860
Which is better than
making trouble where it matters.

615
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:05,070
Invite him, let him say his piece
about South Africa...

616
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,480
...then let him slip into oblivion.

617
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:38,860
Insurgents.

618
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,780
They've derailed a troop train.

619
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,200
Keep clear!
Come on.

620
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,580
They've killed an English soldier.

621
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,260
We were asked for toleration.

622
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,550
We were asked for patience.

623
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,720
Some of us gave it...

624
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,100
...and some did not.

625
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,980
Their war is over.

626
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,400
And those of us who supported it...

627
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,140
...and those of us who refused...

628
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,740
...must forget our differences.

629
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,280
And there can be no excuses...

630
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,780
...from the British now.

631
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,910
India wants...

632
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,540
...home rule.

633
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:35,870
India...

634
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,120
...demands home rule!

635
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,310
Congratulations.

636
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,410
And let no one question...

637
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,620
...that Mr. Jinnah speaks...

638
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:14,020
...not just for the Muslims...

639
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,320
...but for all India!

640
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,750
And now...

641
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,290
...I'm going to introduce to you...

642
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,470
...a man whose writings...

643
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,800
...we are all becoming familiar with.

644
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:35,140
A man who stood in high esteem
with our own beloved Gokhale.

645
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:39,810
A man whose accomplishments in
South Africa will always be remembered.

646
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,100
Mr. Mohandas Gandhi!

647
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,360
Your journal has made great impact.

648
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,890
I'm flattered by Mr. Patel.

649
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,200
I would be even more flattered
if what he said were true.

650
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,650
But it is true.

651
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,290
I read it. Often!

652
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:11,720
Since I returned from South Africa...

653
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,640
...I've travelled over much of India.

654
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:21,390
And I know that I could travel
for many more years...

655
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:24,860
...and still only see
a small part of her.

656
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,720
And yet, I already know...

657
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,860
...that what we say here...

658
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,900
...means nothing to
the masses of our country.

659
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:38,070
Here, we make speeches
for each other...

660
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,870
...and those English liberal magazines
that may grant us a few lines.

661
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,550
But the people of India...

662
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,080
...are...

663
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,080
...untouched.

664
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:55,220
Their politics are confined to bread...

665
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:56,890
...and salt.

666
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,520
Illiterate they may be,
but they're not blind.

667
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:03,020
They see no reason to give their
loyalty to rich and powerful men...

668
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:06,400
...who simply want to take over
the role of the British...

669
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:08,440
...in the name of freedom.

670
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,990
This congress tells the world...

671
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,350
...it represents India.

672
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,730
My brothers...

673
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,290
...India...

674
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:23,000
...is 700,000 villages...

675
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,130
...not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi...

676
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,790
...and Bombay.

677
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,220
Until we stand in the fields...

678
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:36,340
...with the millions that toil
each day under the hot sun...

679
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:40,390
...we will not represent India.

680
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,300
Nor will we ever be able
to challenge the British...

681
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:46,600
...as one nation.

682
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:05,460
Have you read his magazine?

683
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,200
No.

684
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,540
But I think I'm going to.

685
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,590
Pull over.

686
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,390
This can't be the way.

687
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,300
Yes, I'm sure this is
the direction India is taking.

688
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,310
To think I almost got
excited by Mr. Jinnah...

689
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,600
...when all this was awaiting me.

690
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:48,580
We're looking for Mr. Gandhi.

691
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:54,210
-You'll find him under that tree.
-Thank you.

692
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,680
I'm anxious to meet this new force.

693
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,300
I try to live like an Indian,
as you see.

694
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,600
It's stupid, of course.

695
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,390
Because in our country...

696
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,140
...it is the British who decide
how an Indian lives...

697
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,260
...what he may buy, what he may sell.

698
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,270
And from their luxury...

699
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,280
...in the midst
of our terrible poverty...

700
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,810
...they instruct us on
what is justice, what is sedition.

701
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:26,080
So it's only natural
that our best young minds...

702
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:29,170
...assume an air of Eastern dignity...

703
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,080
...while greedily assimilating...

704
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:35,130
...every Western weakness as quickly
as they can acquire it.

705
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,180
If we have home rule...

706
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,010
...that'll change.

707
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,010
Would you, please?

708
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,730
Why should the British
grant us home rule?

709
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:56,270
We must take
the peelings to the goats.

710
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:01,280
We only make wild speeches or
perform even wilder acts of terrorism.

711
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,160
We've bred an army of anarchists...

712
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:06,740
...but not one group that can
fight the British anywhere.

713
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:08,870
Hello! Hello!

714
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,960
But I thought you were
against fighting.

715
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:14,380
Now just spread it around.

716
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:16,130
There you are.

717
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,170
They like the new peelings
mixed in with the rotting ones.

718
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,470
Where there's injustice,
I always believed in fighting.

719
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:30,060
The question is, do you fight
to change things or to punish?

720
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:34,110
I've found we're all such sinners,
we should leave punishment to God.

721
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,980
And if we really want
to change things...

722
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,740
...there are better ways
of doing it...

723
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:43,360
...than derailing trains
or slashing someone with a sword.

724
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:45,320
The fire is ready.

725
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,580
You see, even here...

726
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,580
...we live under tyranny.

727
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:00,880
What did I tell you?
Look at him!

728
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,000
I can see the British shaking now.

729
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,320
Hello!

730
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:26,410
I'm looking for Mr. Gandhi.

731
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:32,080
I've been trying to speak
to you for a long time.

732
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,000
Our crops.

733
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,000
We cannot sell them.

734
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,710
We have no money.

735
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:44,050
But the landlords still
demand the same rent.

736
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,100
We have nothing left.

737
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,980
Mr. Taylor, sir. Up here!

738
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,560
Jesus!

739
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,580
What the hell is going on?

740
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,950
I don't know, sir.

741
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,420
The agent got a telegram.

742
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:03,380
And it just said, "He is coming,"
and gave the time of the train.

743
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,500
Who the hell is "he"?

744
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:13,670
I don't know, sir.

745
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,920
Out of the way.
Come on, you!

746
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,970
-Who the devil are you?
-My name is Mohandas K. Gandhi.

747
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,970
Whoever you are,
we don't want you here.

748
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,220
I suggest you get back on
that train before it leaves.

749
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:56,390
They seem to want me.

750
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,670
Now, look here.

751
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,850
I'll put you under arrest
if you'd prefer.

752
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,060
On what charge?

753
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,030
I don't want any trouble.

754
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,870
I'm an Indian travelling in my own
country. I see no reason for trouble.

755
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,620
Well, there had better not be.

756
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,880
Make way for the officer.

757
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,940
For years...

758
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,690
...the landlords have ordered us...

759
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,240
...to grow indigo...

760
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,450
...for dyeing cloth.

761
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:56,190
Always, they took part
of the crop as rent.

762
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,290
But now...

763
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:02,920
...everyone buys their cloth
from England.

764
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,320
So no one wants...

765
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,040
...our indigo.

766
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,710
The landlords...

767
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:11,800
...say we must pay our rent...

768
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,470
...in cash.

769
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:16,850
What we could...

770
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:18,930
...we sold.

771
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,980
The police have taken the rest.

772
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:23,730
There is...

773
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,220
...no food.

774
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,360
I understand.

775
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,200
The landlords are British?

776
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:45,630
What we can do, we will try to do.

777
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:06,850
Shukla...

778
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,600
...is all Champaran like this?

779
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:11,730
Yes, Bapu.

780
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,740
The whole region.

781
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,400
Hundreds.

782
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:16,530
Thousands.

783
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,610
Some landlords have tried to help.

784
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,000
But what can they do?

785
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:41,680
-Are you Mr. M.K. Gandhi?
-Yes.

786
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,930
I'm sorry, you're under arrest.

787
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,190
I'm not sorry at all.

788
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:59,030
Who did you say
would be buying the drinks?

789
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:03,950
Oh, no!

790
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:14,050
Wouldn't you know, that's the best
innings I've had since Oxford.

791
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,970
India's full of grief, old man.

792
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,180
I've got no idea.

793
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:21,180
All I know is there's a riot or
something at Motihari in Champaran.

794
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,630
The whole company's ordered out.

795
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,330
I would like to see the prisoner.

796
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,960
On the left, sir.

797
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:07,480
Shades of South Africa.

798
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:08,810
Not quite.

799
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:10,770
They're only holding me...

800
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,110
...until the magistrate's hearing.

801
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,360
Then it will be prison.

802
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,780
Did they take your clothes?

803
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:23,070
These are my clothes now.

804
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:28,160
You always had
a puritanical streak, Mohan.

805
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:30,750
If I want to be one with them...

806
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:32,710
...I have to live like them.

807
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,250
Yes, I think you do.

808
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,540
But thank God we all don't.

809
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,760
My puritanism runs in a different way.

810
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,970
I'm far too modest for such a display.

811
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,440
Couldn't I be let in with
the prisoner? I am a clergyman.

812
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:06,580
They're calling you "Bapu."

813
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,490
I thought it meant "father."

814
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,620
It does.

815
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,670
We must be getting old, Charlie.

816
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,210
What do you want me to do?

817
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,470
I think that you can help us most...

818
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,100
...by taking that assignment
you've been offered in Fiji.

819
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,190
I have to be sure--

820
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:34,850
They have to be sure
that what we do...

821
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:38,320
...can be done by Indians alone.

822
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,700
But you know the strategy.

823
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:55,210
The world is full of people who
will despise what's happening here.

824
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,170
It is their strength that we need.

825
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,750
Before you go...

826
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:02,970
...you could start us
in the right direction.

827
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,560
I must leave from Calcutta...

828
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:17,360
...and soon.

829
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,780
Say goodbye to Ba for me.

830
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:27,780
Well, I...

831
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:31,990
There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie.

832
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,120
Wherever you are,
you will always be in my heart.

833
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:58,940
I'm going to clear the courtroom.

834
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:00,520
I'm not sure we'd be able to.

835
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:03,060
It is a first hearing.
It's supposed to be public.

836
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,110
And he's a lawyer.

837
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,030
I don't know where
they found the nerve.

838
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,330
I don't either, but the troops
won't be here till tomorrow.

839
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,980
How did the press get here
before the military?

840
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,000
That English clergyman sent
a number of telegrams yesterday.

841
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,540
I understand one of them
even went to the viceroy.

842
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:35,850
You have been ordered
out of the province...

843
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,640
...on the grounds
of disturbing the peace.

844
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,450
With respect, I refuse to go.

845
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,700
Do you want to go to jail?

846
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:54,150
As you wish.

847
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,530
All right.

848
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:03,540
I will release you on bail...

849
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:07,660
...of 100 rupees
until I reach a sentence.

850
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:12,800
I refuse to pay 100 rupees.

851
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,150
Then I will grant release on bail...

852
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:29,150
...without payment
until I reach a decision.

853
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:56,550
Gandhiji! Gandhiji!

854
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,360
We are from Bihar.

855
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,110
We received a cable
from an old friend...

856
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,030
...who was at Cambridge with us.

857
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,570
His name is Nehru.

858
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,860
-I believe you know him.
-Indeed.

859
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,530
He tells us you need help,
and we have come to give it.

860
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:23,170
I want to document coldly, rationally,
what is being done here.

861
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:24,740
It may take months.

862
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,540
We have no pressing engagements.

863
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:29,420
You will have to live
with the peasants.

864
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:31,720
There will be risks.

865
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:52,570
I don't know what
this country's coming to.

866
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:53,850
But good God, man!

867
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:57,900
You yourself raised the rent simply
to finance a hunting expedition.

868
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,460
And some of these others:
beatings, illegal seizures...

869
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:04,750
...demanding services without pay.

870
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,320
Even refusing them water.

871
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,300
In India!

872
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:12,090
Nobody knows what it is to try
to get these people to work.

873
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:14,470
You've made this half-naked
whatever-he-is...

874
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,300
...into an international hero.

875
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:21,430
"One lone man, marching dusty roads,
armed only with honesty...

876
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:25,130
...and a bamboo staff, doing battle
with the British Empire."

877
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:28,650
At home, children are
writing essays about him.

878
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,030
What do they want?

879
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,480
Gareth!

880
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:37,190
Yes, sir.

881
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,610
There's a rebate on rents paid.

882
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,540
They're to be free to grow crops
of their own choice.

883
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:47,210
And a commission, part Indian,
to hear grievances.

884
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:53,590
That would satisfy him?

885
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,590
And His Majesty's government.

886
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:59,010
It only needs your signature
for the landlords.

887
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,550
It'll be worth it
to see the back of him.

888
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,570
Thank you, sir.

889
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:19,660
-We're too damned liberal.
-Perhaps.

890
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:24,750
At least this has made the government
see some sense about what men...

891
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,580
...like Mr. Gandhi should be allowed,
and what they should be denied.

892
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:45,390
Where is Mr. Gandhi?

893
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,430
He said he preferred to walk, sir.

894
01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:52,470
I followed him most of the way.
He's just turned the corner.

895
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,980
He came third class.

896
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:58,530
God, give me patience.

897
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:05,330
My house is honoured.

898
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,120
The honour is ours.

899
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:10,040
I'd like you to meet
Dr. Kallenbach, an old friend.

900
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:14,380
He's interested in flowers. I told
him he could wander your garden.

901
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,840
I'll send for my gardener.
You'll have plenty to discuss.

902
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:19,590
Thank you.

903
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,180
Gentlemen, the hero of Champaran.

904
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:28,760
Only the stubborn man of Champaran.

905
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,100
Mr. Patel you know.

906
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:33,930
Maulana Azad, my colleague
and a fellow Muslim...

907
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,980
...and just recently
released from prison.

908
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,240
Mr. Kripalani.

909
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,620
And of course, you know Mr. Nehru.

910
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,740
I'm beginning to know Mr. Nehru.

911
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,080
Please sit down. Do sit down.

912
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:54,710
Gentlemen, I've asked you to come
here through Mr. Jinnah's kindness...

913
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,760
...because I've had the chance
to see the legislation.

914
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,120
And it is exactly as was rumoured.

915
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,890
Arrest without warrant,
and automatic imprisonment...

916
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,670
...for possession of materials
considered seditious.

917
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,430
And your writings
are specifically listed.

918
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,980
So much for helping them
in the Great War.

919
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:16,810
There is only one answer:
Direct action on a scale...

920
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:18,820
...they can never handle.

921
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,280
I don't think so.

922
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:25,270
Terrorism would only justify
their repression.

923
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,620
And what kind of leaders
would it throw up?

924
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:32,710
Are they men that we'd want
at the head of our country?

925
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,000
I too have read
Mr. Gandhi's writings...

926
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:39,870
...but I'd rather be ruled by an
Indian terrorist than an English one.

927
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,470
And I don't intend to submit
to that kind of law.

928
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,800
I must say, it seems to me...

929
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:49,880
...that it's gone beyond remedies
like passive resistance.

930
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,020
If I may...

931
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:55,730
...I, for one, have never
advocated passive anything.

932
01:18:58,270 --> 01:18:59,140
I'm with Mr. Jinnah.

933
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,730
We must never submit to such laws...

934
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,450
...ever.

935
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:09,610
And I think our resistance must be
active and provocative.

936
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:12,900
May I?

937
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:18,910
I want to embarrass all those
who wish to treat us as slaves.

938
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:22,010
Thank you.

939
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,010
All of them.

940
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,920
-Forgive my stupid illustration.
-Allow me.

941
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,850
No, please.

942
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,190
But I want to change their minds...

943
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:37,850
...not kill them
for weaknesses we all possess.

944
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,030
And what resistance would you offer?

945
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:47,450
The law is due
to take effect from April 6.

946
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,620
I want to call upon the nation...

947
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:53,650
...to make that a day of
prayer and fasting.

948
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:55,000
A general strike?

949
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:59,040
I mean a day of prayer and fasting.

950
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:02,750
Of course, no work could be done.
No buses.

951
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,010
No trains.

952
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,680
No factories.

953
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:07,880
No administration.

954
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,430
The country would stop.

955
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:15,430
My God, it would terrify them!

956
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:18,470
350 million people at prayer?

957
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,900
Even the English newspapers
would have to report that...

958
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,940
...and explain why.

959
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:26,740
-But could we get people to do it?
-Why not?

960
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,980
Champaran stirred the whole country.

961
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,120
Thank you.

962
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,540
They're calling you "Mahatma."

963
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:37,920
"Great Soul."

964
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,130
Fortunately, such news comes
very slowly to where I live.

965
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:48,380
I think if we all worked
to publicize it...

966
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:49,830
...all of congress...

967
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:52,180
...every avenue we know...

968
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:56,890
I could get articles printed in most
of the papers in Delhi and Bombay.

969
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:10,660
Only civilians will visit.
Don't you think so, Your Highness?

970
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:13,740
Of course, the army will
always be loyal.

971
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:16,830
I'll have you know,
we've got 500 troops.

972
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,910
They'll be damn hungry by morning,
I'll tell you that.

973
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:32,350
Mr. Kinnoch.

974
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:35,010
Sir, I'm afraid it's confirmed.

975
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:37,380
Nothing's working, sir.

976
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,310
The buses, the trains, the markets.

977
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:43,440
There's not even any ordinary
civilian staff here, sir.

978
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:46,230
Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?

979
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,700
Karachi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore.
It's total.

980
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:51,950
The army had to take over
the telegraph...

981
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,950
...or we'd be cut off from the world.

982
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:03,460
I can't believe it.

983
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:06,240
He's going to sell his own paper
tomorrow in Bombay, sir.

984
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,880
They've called for a parade
on Victoria Road.

985
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,580
Arrest him.

986
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:21,340
He's to go to the visitors' room.

987
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:40,830
Bapu.

988
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:43,460
You too?

989
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:47,840
It seems less formal than Mahatma.

990
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:59,560
Since your arrest,
the riots have hardly stopped.

991
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:02,630
Not big, but they keep breaking out.

992
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:04,400
I run to stop them.

993
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:09,320
And Patel and Kripalani,
they're never at rest.

994
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:14,110
But some English civilians
have been killed.

995
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:20,080
And the army is attacking
crowds with clubs.

996
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,620
Sometimes worse.

997
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,420
Maybe I'm wrong.

998
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:34,460
Maybe we're not ready yet.

999
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,090
In South Africa,
our numbers were small.

1000
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:46,650
The government's afraid.
They don't know what to do.

1001
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,980
They're more afraid
of terrorism than of you.

1002
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,820
The viceroy's agreed to your release
if you will speak for nonviolence.

1003
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:00,580
I've never spoken for anything else.

1004
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,760
England...

1005
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,770
...is so powerful.

1006
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:31,850
Its army...

1007
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:33,270
...and its navy...

1008
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:36,070
...all its modern weapons...

1009
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,320
But when a great power like that...

1010
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,370
...strikes defenceless people...

1011
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,040
...it shows its brutality...

1012
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,320
...its own weakness.

1013
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:50,420
Especially when those people
do not strike back.

1014
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,560
Fighting back will not work.

1015
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:24,040
And that is why the Mahatma...

1016
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:27,830
...begs us to take
the course of nonviolence.

1017
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:01,780
Back away! Back away!

1018
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,040
But if we riot...

1019
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:15,250
...if we fight back...

1020
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:18,670
...we become the vandals...

1021
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,340
...and they become the law.

1022
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:25,970
If we bear their blows,
they are the vandals.

1023
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,600
God and His law are on our--

1024
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,470
Front rank, kneel in position!

1025
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,000
We...

1026
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,700
...must have the courage...

1027
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,200
...to take their anger.

1028
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,200
Should we issue a warning, sir?

1029
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,400
They've had their warning:

1030
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,900
No meetings.

1031
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,400
Fire!

1032
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,400
Take your time!

1033
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,200
Corporal!

1034
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,000
To your left.

1035
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,000
General Dyer...

1036
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,000
...is it correct that you ordered
your troops to fire...

1037
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,600
...at the thickest part of the crowd?

1038
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:37,900
That is so.

1039
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,800
1516 casualties with...

1040
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,900
...1650 bullets.

1041
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,000
My intention was
to inflict a lesson...

1042
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,300
...that would have an impact
throughout all India.

1043
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:02,800
General...

1044
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:08,200
...had you been able to
take in the armoured car...

1045
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,300
...would you have opened fire
with the machine gun?

1046
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,200
I think, probably, yes.

1047
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:25,000
General, did you realize there were
children and women in the crowd?

1048
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,800
I did.

1049
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,500
But that was irrelevant
to the point you were making?

1050
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:33,400
That is correct.

1051
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,800
Could I ask you what provision
you made for the wounded?

1052
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,200
I was ready to help any who applied.

1053
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,300
General, how does a child...

1054
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,300
...shot with a.303 Lee-Enfield...

1055
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,300
...apply for help?

1056
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:50,700
Forgive me, gentlemen,
but you must understand...

1057
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:56,000
...that His Majesty's government
and the British people repudiate...

1058
01:34:56,300 --> 01:35:00,500
...both the massacre and
the philosophy that prompted it.

1059
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,400
Now...

1060
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,600
...what I would like to do...

1061
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,400
...is to come to some compromise
over the new--

1062
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,100
If you will excuse me,
Your Excellency...

1063
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,600
...it is our view that matters
have gone beyond legislation.

1064
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,900
We think it is time you recognized...

1065
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:21,200
...that you are masters
in someone else's home.

1066
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:25,500
Despite the best intentions
of the best of you...

1067
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:29,700
...you must, in the nature of things,
humiliate us to control us.

1068
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,700
General Dyer is but an extreme
example of the principle.

1069
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,500
It is time you left.

1070
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,000
With respect, Mr. Gandhi...

1071
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:46,400
...without British administration...

1072
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,700
...this country would be
reduced to chaos.

1073
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,300
Mr. Kinnoch...

1074
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,600
...I beg you to accept
that there is no people...

1075
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:57,300
...who would not prefer
their own bad government...

1076
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,800
...to the good government
of an alien power.

1077
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,800
My dear sir, India is British.

1078
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:05,400
We're hardly an alien power.

1079
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,800
Even if His Majesty could waive
all other considerations...

1080
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,100
...he has a duty to the millions
of his Muslim subjects...

1081
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:24,400
...who are a minority in this realm.

1082
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:28,100
And experience suggests
that his troops...

1083
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:31,900
...and his administration
are essential...

1084
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:34,700
...in order to secure the peace.

1085
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:38,900
All nations contain
religious minorities.

1086
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:42,200
Like other countries,
ours will have its problems.

1087
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,200
But they will be ours...

1088
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,700
...not yours.

1089
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,900
How do you propose
to make them yours?

1090
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,500
You don't think we're just
going to walk out of India.

1091
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:54,100
Yes.

1092
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:56,200
In the end...

1093
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,900
...you will walk out...

1094
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:01,900
...because 100,000 Englishmen
simply cannot control...

1095
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,800
...350 million Indians
if those Indians refuse...

1096
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,700
...to cooperate.

1097
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:09,400
And that is what
we intend to achieve.

1098
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,900
Peaceful, nonviolent
noncooperation...

1099
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:17,900
...till you yourself
see the wisdom of leaving...

1100
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,000
...Your Excellency.

1101
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,900
I said to him, "You don't
expect us just to walk out."

1102
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:27,900
And he said, "Yes."

1103
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:30,900
What an extraordinary little man,
isn't he?

1104
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:33,400
"Nonviolence, noncooperation."

1105
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,600
For a moment, I was afraid they were
actually going to do something.

1106
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,400
Yes, but I think it would be wise
to be very cautious for a time.

1107
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,400
The Antiterrorist Act
will remain on the statutes...

1108
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:48,100
...but on no account
is Gandhi to be arrested.

1109
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,800
Whatever mischief he causes...

1110
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,100
...I have no intention
of making a martyr of him.

1111
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:00,900
But now something worse is happening.

1112
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:03,400
When Gandhiji and I were growing up...

1113
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:06,900
...women wove their own cloth.

1114
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,900
But now there are millions
who have no work...

1115
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:16,600
...because those who can,
buy all they need from England.

1116
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,000
I say with Gandhiji:

1117
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:23,800
There is no beauty
in the finest cloth...

1118
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
...if it makes hunger and unhappiness.

1119
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,400
My message to you...

1120
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,800
...is the message I have given
to your brothers everywhere.

1121
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:09,000
To gain independence...

1122
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,400
...we must prove worthy of it.

1123
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:17,700
There must be
Hindu-Muslim unity always.

1124
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,000
Second:

1125
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:28,800
No Indian must be treated
as the English treat us.

1126
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,400
We must remove untouchability...

1127
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,500
...from our hearts and from our lives.

1128
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:41,400
Third:

1129
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:44,800
We must defy the British.

1130
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:06,000
Not with violence
that will inflame their will...

1131
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:10,700
...but with a firmness that will
open their eyes.

1132
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:13,900
English factories make the cloth...

1133
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,700
...that makes our poverty.

1134
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,400
All those who wish to
make the English see...

1135
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,500
...bring me the cloth from Manchester
and Leeds that you wear today...

1136
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,800
...and we will light a fire
that will be seen in Delhi...

1137
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,500
...and in London.

1138
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,200
And if...

1139
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:35,400
...like me...

1140
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:39,300
...you are left with only
one piece of homespun...

1141
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,400
...wear it with dignity.

1142
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,600
Thank you very much.

1143
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:32,400
No, thank you, I can manage.

1144
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:35,800
Don't destroy my good intentions.

1145
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:38,100
I'm already feeling guilty
about travelling second class.

1146
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,200
You've earned a few indulgences.

1147
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:43,100
Perhaps, but Maulana's made
of sterner stuff.

1148
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:45,000
Our trains met in Bombay.

1149
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:48,300
And there he is, back in
that lot, the model disciple.

1150
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,400
There's another passenger.

1151
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:54,500
A Miss Slade from London. She's
been writing to Gandhiji for years.

1152
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,100
She's the daughter
of an English admiral.

1153
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,800
What do you think the daughter
of an English admiral...

1154
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,700
...proposes to do in our ashram?

1155
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:05,900
-Sink us?
-From the looks of the luggage, yes.

1156
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:09,800
She wants to make her home with us.
And Gandhiji has agreed.

1157
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,600
Miss Slade!

1158
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:13,900
You'd be Mr. Kallenbach.

1159
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:17,400
And you would be Miss Slade?

1160
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:20,200
I prefer the name
Gandhiji has given me:

1161
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,700
Mirabehn.

1162
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:31,600
Don't pull it so fast.
You'll break it again.

1163
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:41,600
Leave it. Leave it.

1164
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:44,000
God gave you 10 thumbs.

1165
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,400
Eleven.

1166
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,400
Sardar!

1167
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,200
Mirabehn!

1168
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,500
Come, come.

1169
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,400
You will be my daughter.

1170
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:14,900
But then...

1171
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,300
...some rioting broke out...

1172
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:20,300
...between Hindus and Muslims.

1173
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,800
Violent, terrible.

1174
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:27,000
Whether it was provoked...

1175
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:29,400
...I don't know.

1176
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:34,100
But it gave them an excuse to impose
martial law throughout Bengal.

1177
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:38,400
Some of the things
the military have done...

1178
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,900
Is the campaign weakening?

1179
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:44,200
The marches and protests are bigger,
if anything.

1180
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,400
But with the censorship here...

1181
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:48,400
...they know more in England...

1182
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,900
...than we do.

1183
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:54,400
It saps the courage to think you
may be suffering alone.

1184
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:56,900
They are not alone.

1185
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:01,600
And martial law only shows
how desperate the British are.

1186
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:08,200
Is that homespun?

1187
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:11,900
I sent for it from here.

1188
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:13,200
I dyed it myself.

1189
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,800
What do the workers in England
make of what we're doing?

1190
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:21,800
It must have produced hardship.

1191
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,400
It has...

1192
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:26,400
...but you'd be surprised.
They do understand.

1193
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:27,800
Good.

1194
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:33,200
Ba will have to teach you
to spin too.

1195
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,500
-I'd rather march.
-First, spin!

1196
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,400
Let the others march for a time.

1197
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,000
I'll teach you all our foolishness.

1198
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:45,000
And you must teach me yours.

1199
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:57,400
We burn British cloth!
We burn British cloth!

1200
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:08,100
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1201
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:25,800
British rule must go!
British rule must go!

1202
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,700
I'll stuff it down your damn throat!

1203
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,100
Help us!

1204
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,600
Leave us alone!
We're not harming you.

1205
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,000
Go on your way. On your way!

1206
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Come back!

1207
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,400
Help us! Help us!

1208
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:54,000
Help! Help!

1209
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:27,700
That's one bit of news
they haven't censored.

1210
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,600
Now it's all over the world.

1211
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:36,800
India's "nonviolence."

1212
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:40,500
What can we do?

1213
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:42,800
We must end the campaign.

1214
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:49,700
After what they did at the massacre?
It's only an eye for an eye.

1215
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:54,500
An eye for an eye only ends up
making the whole world blind.

1216
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,400
Do you know the sacrifices
people have made?

1217
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:00,000
We'd never get the same
commitment again, ever.

1218
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:03,200
The whole of India is on the move!

1219
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,700
Yes, but in what direction?

1220
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,800
If we obtain our freedom by murder and
bloodshed, I want no part of it.

1221
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:16,100
You are the father of the nation.

1222
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,500
Today, I see no ground in that
for anything but shame.

1223
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:25,200
This was one incident.

1224
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:28,400
Tell that to the families of
the policemen who died.

1225
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:37,500
The whole nation is marching.

1226
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:41,000
They wouldn't stop,
even if we asked them to.

1227
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:45,300
I will ask.

1228
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,400
And I will fast as a penance
for my part in arousing such emotions.

1229
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:53,300
And I will not stop until they stop.

1230
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:56,200
But...

1231
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:59,700
God! You can be sure
the British won't censor that.

1232
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:02,000
They'll put it on every street corner.

1233
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:07,200
People are aroused.

1234
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:09,100
They won't stop!

1235
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:13,800
If I die, perhaps they will stop.

1236
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:56,100
I must get ready for morning prayers.

1237
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:58,300
Mirabehn is here.

1238
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:47,100
I've brought your drinking water.

1239
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:03,100
There's a little lemon juice in it.
That's all.

1240
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:19,000
Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru.

1241
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:21,400
There was a telegram.

1242
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:24,700
Almost everywhere, it has stopped.

1243
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:27,000
When it is everywhere...

1244
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:31,100
...then my prayers will be answered.

1245
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,200
Do you find me stubborn?

1246
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,300
I don't know.

1247
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:42,400
I know that you are right.

1248
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:45,300
I don't know that this is right.

1249
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,700
May I turn you?

1250
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,400
When I despair...

1251
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:09,400
...I remember that
all through history...

1252
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:14,500
...the way of truth and love
has always won.

1253
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:19,400
There have been tyrants
and murderers...

1254
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:23,700
...and, for a time,
they can seem invincible.

1255
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:27,100
But in the end, they always fall.

1256
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:30,200
Think of it.

1257
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:33,500
Always.

1258
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:38,800
Whenever you are in doubt that
that is God's way...

1259
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:42,000
...the way the world is meant to be...

1260
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,800
...think of that...

1261
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:48,500
...and then try to do it His way.

1262
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:56,200
And now, could I have
another feast of lemon juice?

1263
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:01,600
Panditji!

1264
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:15,400
Jinnah...

1265
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:17,500
...Patel...

1266
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:22,200
...all of congress has called
for the end of noncooperation.

1267
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:26,100
There's not been one demonstration.

1268
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:31,900
All over India, people are praying
that you will end the fast.

1269
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,900
They're walking in the streets...

1270
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:36,900
...offering garlands to the police...

1271
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,400
...and British soldiers.

1272
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:45,600
Perhaps I have overdone it.

1273
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:09,500
-Good morning, Bapu.
-Good morning.

1274
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:13,000
Don't let him go.
If he bumps me, I'm done for.

1275
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:15,200
Don't worry, I won't let him go.

1276
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,600
I'm sorry, Mr. Gandhi, sir...

1277
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,400
...but you're under arrest.

1278
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:49,400
On what charge?

1279
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:51,000
Sedition.

1280
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,400
You can't be serious.

1281
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:55,500
This man has just stopped
a revolution.

1282
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:56,900
That's as may be.

1283
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:59,100
I only know what
I am charged to perform.

1284
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:00,700
I don't believe it!

1285
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,400
Even the British can't be that stupid.

1286
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:05,200
Help me, please.

1287
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:09,100
Mira, you must look after Ba.

1288
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:17,800
If there is one protest, one riot,
a disgrace of any kind...

1289
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:19,500
...I will fast again.

1290
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,000
Herman.

1291
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:23,600
I have been on many trips.

1292
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:25,000
Monda.

1293
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:28,100
This is just another trip.

1294
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:30,800
I am at your command.

1295
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:39,600
I know we are not ready
for my kind of independence.

1296
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:43,000
If I'm sent to jail,
perhaps that is the best protest...

1297
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:45,400
...our country can make at this time.

1298
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:51,300
And if it helps India, I've never
refused His Majesty's hospitality.

1299
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,600
Call the prisoner to the bar.

1300
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:50,600
"Noncooperation has one aim:

1301
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,000
The overthrow of the government.

1302
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:55,700
Sedition must become our creed.

1303
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:58,200
We must give no quarter...

1304
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:01,300
...nor can we expect any."

1305
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,800
-Do you deny writing it?
-Not at all.

1306
01:57:04,700 --> 01:57:06,700
And I will save the court's time...

1307
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:09,400
...my lord, by stating
under oath that, to this day...

1308
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:12,000
...I believe noncooperation
with evil is a duty...

1309
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:14,500
...and that British rule
of India is evil.

1310
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:18,100
The prosecution rests, my lord.

1311
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,800
I presume you are conducting
your own defence.

1312
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,900
I have no defence, my lord.
I am guilty as charged.

1313
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:31,800
And if you truly believe
in your system of law...

1314
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,700
...you must inflict on me
the severest penalty possible.

1315
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:51,600
It is impossible for me to ignore
that you're in a different category...

1316
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:54,800
...from any person
I have ever tried...

1317
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:57,800
...or am likely to try.

1318
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:00,800
Nevertheless, it is my duty
to sentence you...

1319
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,800
...to six years' imprisonment.

1320
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:19,000
If, however, His Majesty's government
should, at some later date...

1321
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,800
...see fit to reduce the term...

1322
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:28,100
...no one will be
better pleased than I.

1323
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:58,100
Yes, I'm sure that's exactly
what they hoped:

1324
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:01,700
Put him in prison a few years.
With luck, he'd be forgotten.

1325
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:04,400
Maybe they could even subdue him.

1326
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:07,300
Well, he certainly wasn't forgotten.

1327
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:10,000
And as soon as he got out,
he was back, tramping the countryside...

1328
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:13,800
...preaching nonviolence and
demanding a free India.

1329
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:18,100
Everyone knows
another showdown's coming.

1330
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:22,500
How does an American journalist
in Central America...

1331
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:25,400
...learn that Gandhi was born
in Porbandar anyway?

1332
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,600
I've been aware of him
for a long time.

1333
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:29,900
He certainly makes good copy.

1334
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:34,800
The other day, Winston Churchill
called him a half-naked Indian fakir.

1335
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:37,700
I met him once.

1336
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,700
-What, you mean Gandhi?
-Yeah.

1337
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:42,200
South Africa, a long time ago.

1338
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:44,600
I wonder if he'll recognize me.

1339
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:45,900
What was he like?

1340
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:48,400
He had a full head of hair then.

1341
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,700
We were a bit like college students,
trying to figure everything out.

1342
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:54,800
Well, he must have found
some of the answers.

1343
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:05,100
In every worthy wish of yours,
I shall be your helpmate.

1344
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,300
Helpmate.

1345
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:13,100
Take the fourth step,
that we may be ever full of joy.

1346
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:16,900
I will ever live devoted to you...

1347
02:00:17,100 --> 02:00:21,700
...speaking words of love
and praying for your happiness.

1348
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:25,400
Take the fifth step...

1349
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:27,400
...the walking around a fire...

1350
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,100
...that we may serve the people.

1351
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:36,000
I will follow close behind you...

1352
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:38,800
...and help to serve the people.

1353
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:42,400
Take the sixth step...

1354
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:47,200
...that we may follow
our vows in life.

1355
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:52,000
I will follow you
in all our vows and duties.

1356
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:55,200
Take the seventh step...

1357
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:01,200
...that we may ever
live as friends.

1358
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:05,900
You are my best friend...

1359
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:09,100
...my highest guru...

1360
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,400
...and my sovereign lord.

1361
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:19,500
And then I put a sweetened
wheat cake in her mouth.

1362
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:22,300
And I put a sweetened
wheat cake in his mouth.

1363
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:25,100
And with that, we were pronounced...

1364
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:27,000
...man and wife.

1365
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:31,800
We were both 13.

1366
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:45,800
It's beautiful.

1367
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:49,300
Even as a boy...

1368
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:51,000
...I thought so.

1369
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,500
Thank you.

1370
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:58,900
Trying to keep up with you
is like chasing a jackrabbit.

1371
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:04,500
You've come because you think
something is going to happen.

1372
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:06,800
Is it?

1373
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:08,900
Perhaps.

1374
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,800
I've come here to think about it.

1375
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:17,700
Do you remember much
of South Africa?

1376
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:20,400
Oh, yes. A great deal.

1377
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:24,700
I've travelled so far...

1378
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:27,500
...and thought so much.

1379
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:35,800
As you can see,
my city is a sea city.

1380
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:39,500
Always full of Hindus...

1381
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:41,300
...Muslims...

1382
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:43,700
...Sikhs, Jews, Persians.

1383
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:49,200
My family's sect was the Pranami.

1384
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:50,900
Hindu, of course.

1385
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:54,300
But in our temple,
the priest used to read...

1386
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:56,800
...from the Muslim Koran...

1387
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,900
...and the Hindu Gita,
moving from one to the other...

1388
02:03:00,100 --> 02:03:02,600
...as if it mattered not
which book was read...

1389
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,700
...as long as God was worshipped.

1390
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:09,700
When I was a boy...

1391
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:12,400
...I used to sing a song
in the temple.

1392
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:20,200
A true disciple
Knows another"s woes

1393
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,600
As his own

1394
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:24,300
He bows to all...

1395
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:26,700
...and despises none.

1396
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,200
Like all other boys...

1397
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:30,900
...I sang the words...

1398
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:35,700
...not thinking what they meant
or how they might influence me.

1399
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:41,300
I've travelled so far.

1400
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:45,100
And all I've done is come back...

1401
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:47,100
...home.

1402
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:58,200
Wait a minute.

1403
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:01,400
You know what you're going to do,
don't you?

1404
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:03,000
It would have been uncivil of me...

1405
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:06,000
...to let you make
such a long trip for nothing.

1406
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:10,100
-Where are you going?
-Come.

1407
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:14,200
-Where are we going?
-Back to the ashram.

1408
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:16,400
Then to prove to the new viceroy...

1409
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:19,600
...that the king's writ
no longer runs in India.

1410
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:20,900
Salt?

1411
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:25,100
Yes, sir. He's going to march
to the sea and make salt.

1412
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:30,600
There's a royal monopoly
on the manufacture of salt.

1413
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:35,300
It's illegal to make it or sell it
without a government license.

1414
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:38,000
All right, he's breaking the law.

1415
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:41,500
What will that deprive us of?
Two rupees of salt tax?

1416
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:43,300
It's not a serious attack
on the revenue.

1417
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:46,500
Its primary importance is symbolic.

1418
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:48,800
Don't patronize me, Charles.

1419
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:56,400
In this climate, nothing lives
without water or salt.

1420
02:04:56,700 --> 02:05:00,800
Our absolute control of it is
a control on the pulse of India.

1421
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:05,400
And that's the basis of
this declaration of independence?

1422
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:06,800
The day he sets off...

1423
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:11,100
...everyone is supposed to
raise the flag of "Free India."

1424
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:16,500
And then he walks some 240 miles
to the sea and makes salt.

1425
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:22,800
I say ignore it.

1426
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,500
Let them raise their damned flags.

1427
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:26,700
Let him make his salt.

1428
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:31,000
It's only symbolic
if we choose to make it so.

1429
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:35,000
He'll arrive at the sea...

1430
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:38,400
...on the anniversary
of the Massacre of Amritsar.

1431
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:50,000
General Edgar is right.
Ignore it.

1432
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:53,300
Mr. Gandhi will find
it takes a great deal more...

1433
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:57,300
...than a pinch of salt
to bring down the British Empire.

1434
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:54,500
You've done me a great service.

1435
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:55,900
Not at all, sir.

1436
02:06:56,200 --> 02:07:00,300
It would be uncivil of us to let you
make such a long trip for nothing.

1437
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:16,300
We'll go.

1438
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:20,200
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1439
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:44,700
Is it over if they arrest you now?

1440
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:46,000
Not if they arrest me...

1441
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:48,700
...or 1000 or 10,000.

1442
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:52,900
It's not only generals
who know how to plan campaigns.

1443
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:56,100
What if they don't arrest you?
What if they don't react at all?

1444
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:57,700
Something for your notebook:

1445
02:07:58,100 --> 02:08:01,500
The function of a civil resister
is to provoke response.

1446
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:03,500
And we will continue to provoke...

1447
02:08:03,700 --> 02:08:07,000
...until they respond
or they change the law.

1448
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:10,400
They are not in control.
We are.

1449
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,100
That is the strength
of civil resistance.

1450
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,100
Vince!

1451
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,700
-What did he say?
-He said he's in control.

1452
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:48,700
Do you intend to walk all the way?

1453
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,200
It's the only way
I can get the story.

1454
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:53,900
Besides, my name is Walker.

1455
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:56,800
"My name is Walker."

1456
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,800
My dear Mrs. Nehru!

1457
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:50,200
Man needs salt...

1458
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:53,100
...as he needs air and water.

1459
02:10:53,700 --> 02:10:57,600
This salt comes
from the Indian Ocean.

1460
02:10:57,900 --> 02:11:01,700
Let every Indian claim it
as his right.

1461
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:06,200
And so, once more,
the man of nonviolence...

1462
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:09,700
...has challenged the might
of the British Empire.

1463
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,900
They're making it everywhere, sir.
Mobs of them.

1464
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:29,300
Publicly.

1465
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:32,900
Congress leaders are selling it
on the streets of Delhi.

1466
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:34,800
We're being made fools of, sir...

1467
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:36,500
...around the world.

1468
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:38,900
Isn't there any instruction
from London?

1469
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:42,500
We're required to stop it.
And stop it we will!

1470
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:45,200
I don't care if we fill the jails.
Stop it!

1471
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:49,100
Arrest anyone, any rank,
except Gandhi.

1472
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:52,400
We'll cut the strength
from under him.

1473
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:56,900
And then we'll deal with the Mahatma.

1474
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:17,000
Jump to it!
Clear this beach!

1475
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:53,400
Don't hit back!

1476
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:55,200
No violence!

1477
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:09,600
There must be 100,000 under arrest.
And it still goes on.

1478
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:13,000
-Who's leading them?
-I don't know. Nehru, Patel...

1479
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:17,400
...most congress officials are in jail.
And their wives and children.

1480
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:20,400
We've even arrested Nehru's mother.

1481
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,700
Has there been any violence?

1482
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,800
In Peshawar,
the deputy police commissioner...

1483
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,300
...lost his head and opened fire
with a machine gun.

1484
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:35,500
But he's facing disciplinary court.

1485
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:37,900
You can't expect things
like that not to happen.

1486
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:42,700
The question was intended to discover
if there was any violence on their side.

1487
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:46,700
No, sir.

1488
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
I'm afraid not.

1489
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:53,200
Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi,
it might...

1490
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:59,000
He's addressed this letter
directly to you, has he?

1491
02:13:59,300 --> 02:14:00,400
Yes, sir, he has.

1492
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:01,800
The usual thing:

1493
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:04,300
"India's salt belongs to India."

1494
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:05,500
Then he says flatly...

1495
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:10,100
...that he will lead a raid tomorrow
on the Dharasana Salt Works.

1496
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:13,200
Thank him for his letter...

1497
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:15,500
...and put him in jail.

1498
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:18,100
Yes, sir.

1499
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:22,400
It'll be my pleasure.

1500
02:14:22,700 --> 02:14:24,900
-And Fields?
-Sir?

1501
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:27,600
Keep that salt works open.

1502
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:29,700
Yes, sir.

1503
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:36,300
I'm sorry, sir.

1504
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:40,000
My orders are to allow regular staff
only through these gates.

1505
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:41,600
Very well.

1506
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:44,900
in his name.

1507
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:49,900
And for his sake,
we will not raise a hand.

1508
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:53,400
Long live Mahatma Gandhi!

1509
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:57,600
Long live Gandhiji!

1510
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:03,200
We are ready!

1511
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:12,500
I want firmness and discipline.

1512
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:35,600
-All right, take up your positions.
-Yes, sir.

1513
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:44,800
To your mark. Forward!

1514
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:57,600
Last night at midnight...

1515
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,000
...they took Gandhiji from us.

1516
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:03,800
They expect us to lose heart...

1517
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:05,800
...or to fight back.

1518
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:08,700
We will do neither!

1519
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:41,500
On your guard!

1520
02:16:58,300 --> 02:16:59,900
No, sir.
The gate is closed!

1521
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:20,300
"They walked...

1522
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:22,900
...both Hindu and Muslim alike...

1523
02:18:23,900 --> 02:18:25,900
... with heads held high...

1524
02:18:26,300 --> 02:18:28,200
... without any hope of escape...

1525
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:30,500
... from injury or death.

1526
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:34,100
It went on and on into the night."

1527
02:18:34,300 --> 02:18:35,300
Stop.

1528
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:39,800
"Women carried the wounded
and broken bodies from the road...

1529
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,500
...until they dropped
from exhaustion."

1530
02:18:42,700 --> 02:18:43,600
Stop.

1531
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:47,300
"But still, it went on and on.

1532
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:53,800
Whatever moral ascendancy
the West held...

1533
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,900
...was lost here today.

1534
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:58,800
India is free...

1535
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:03,900
... for she has taken all
that steel and cruelty can give...

1536
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:08,200
...and she has neither
cringed nor retreated. ""

1537
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:23,200
I am aware that I must have given
you much cause for irritation...

1538
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:24,700
...Your Excellency.

1539
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I hope it will not stand
between us as men.

1540
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:33,700
Mr. Gandhi...

1541
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:37,800
...I am instructed to request
your attendance...

1542
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,300
...at an all-government
conference in London...

1543
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:46,100
...to discuss the possible
independence...

1544
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:47,800
...of India.

1545
02:20:58,700 --> 02:21:01,100
Only recently released from prison...

1546
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:05,200
...Mahatma Gandhi leaves Bombay
on the SS Rajputana...

1547
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:08,300
... to attend the conference
on Indian independence...

1548
02:21:08,500 --> 02:21:12,800
... called by Prime Minister
Ramsay MacDonald.

1549
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:16,900
Mr. Gandhi, the sole
Indian Congress Party delegate...

1550
02:21:17,200 --> 02:21:19,700
... is staying at Kingsley Hall
in London's East End...

1551
02:21:19,900 --> 02:21:21,500
... for the duration of the talks.

1552
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,200
Hes seen here
amongst local cockneys...

1553
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:26,400
... who have taken him
to their hearts.

1554
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:28,300
Besides attending the conference...

1555
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:31,500
...he has found time to meet
political and religious leaders...

1556
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:33,600
... like Mr. Lloyd George...

1557
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:37,100
... the Archbishop of Canterbury,
George Bernard Shaw...

1558
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:39,200
...and Charlie Chaplin.

1559
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:44,000
He journeyed last week
from Kingsley Hall...

1560
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:48,500
... to accept an invitation to tea
from King George and Queen Mary...

1561
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:52,100
...at Buckingham Palace
before attending the conference.

1562
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:55,900
And I would emphasize
that I think our first duty...

1563
02:21:56,200 --> 02:22:00,400
...is to recognize
that there is not one India...

1564
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:02,600
...but several.

1565
02:22:03,300 --> 02:22:05,200
A Hindu India...

1566
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:07,700
...a Muslim India...

1567
02:22:07,900 --> 02:22:10,500
...and an India of princely states.

1568
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:13,600
And all these must be respected...

1569
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:15,400
...and cared for.

1570
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:17,000
Not just one.

1571
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:44,000
Mr. Gandhi, who has been attending...

1572
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:47,400
... the London Round Table Conference
on Indian Independence...

1573
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:50,200
...journeyed north
to visit a cotton mill.

1574
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:53,200
Although not dressed
for the Lancashire climate...

1575
02:22:53,400 --> 02:22:56,300
...Mr. Gandhi received
a warm welcome from mill workers...

1576
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:58,800
...before heading back south...

1577
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,600
... for a final meeting
with Mr. MacDonald.

1578
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:06,900
The prime minister said the talks
were both constructive and frank.

1579
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,400
So farewell, Mr. Gandhi.

1580
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:15,200
And bon voyage!

1581
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:19,700
So the truth is,
after all your travels...

1582
02:23:19,900 --> 02:23:21,600
...after all your efforts...

1583
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:25,700
...they've stopped the campaign
and sent you back empty-handed.

1584
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:29,400
They're only clinging
to old dreams...

1585
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:32,500
...and trying to split us
in the old way.

1586
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:35,000
But the will has gone.

1587
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:38,300
Independence will fall
like a ripe apple.

1588
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:41,100
The only question is, when and how.

1589
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:43,300
Well, I say, when is now!

1590
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:47,900
And we will determine how.

1591
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:49,800
Precisely.

1592
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:52,200
Bapu, she is limping again.

1593
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:54,100
It's only a sprain.

1594
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:58,000
Take her to the river.
We'll make a mud pack for her.

1595
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:01,900
Go. I won't be a moment.

1596
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:07,500
They are preparing for war.

1597
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:09,700
I will not support it.

1598
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:13,700
But I do not intend to take
advantage of their danger.

1599
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,300
That's when you take advantage.

1600
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:19,500
That is just another way
of hitting back.

1601
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:22,900
We've come a long way together
with the British.

1602
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:26,100
When they leave, we want to
see them off as friends.

1603
02:24:26,300 --> 02:24:31,300
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there is something I must attend to.

1604
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:38,700
Mud packs.

1605
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:53,000
Mr. Gandhi, sir.

1606
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:56,900
I've been instructed to inquire as to
the subject of your speech tonight.

1607
02:24:57,100 --> 02:25:00,300
The value of goat's milk
in daily diet.

1608
02:25:02,300 --> 02:25:06,000
But you can be sure that
I will also speak against war.

1609
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:08,200
Sorry, that can't be permitted.

1610
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:09,500
Corporal!

1611
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:15,700
It's all right, Mrs. Gandhi.

1612
02:25:15,900 --> 02:25:19,400
I have orders to return with you
and your companion to the ashram.

1613
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:23,800
If you take my husband,
I intend to speak in his place.

1614
02:25:49,400 --> 02:25:51,200
Hold it a second, will you?

1615
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:55,800
It was the Aga Khan's palace
before they turned it into a prison.

1616
02:25:56,100 --> 02:25:59,000
They're holding Gandhi
and congress politicians there.

1617
02:25:59,900 --> 02:26:03,400
Pandit Nehru and the others
are up at Ahmednagar Fort.

1618
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:06,900
Not bad for a prison, eh?

1619
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:09,600
I guess no place is good
if you're locked in.

1620
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:11,800
Your timing's pretty lucky.

1621
02:26:12,100 --> 02:26:14,000
They had him cut off from the press.

1622
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:18,000
But his personal secretary died,
so they let up on restrictions.

1623
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:26,100
Yes, I have heard of Life magazine.

1624
02:26:26,300 --> 02:26:30,300
I've even heard of
Margaret Bourke-White.

1625
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:34,500
But I don't know why either
should be interested in an old man...

1626
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:37,100
...sitting alone in prison...

1627
02:26:37,400 --> 02:26:40,800
...while the rest of the world
is blowing itself to pieces.

1628
02:26:41,700 --> 02:26:45,400
Well, you're the only man I know
who makes his own clothes.

1629
02:26:47,700 --> 02:26:51,500
But for me, that's not
much of an accomplishment.

1630
02:26:57,500 --> 02:27:01,400
No, prison is rather agreeable to me.

1631
02:27:01,700 --> 02:27:05,300
And there is no doubt that
after the war...

1632
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:07,700
...independence will come.

1633
02:27:08,100 --> 02:27:09,200
My only worry...

1634
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:11,900
...is what shape it will take.

1635
02:27:12,100 --> 02:27:13,900
-Jinnah has--
-Stop!

1636
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:17,800
I'm sorry, but--
Could you come forward, please?

1637
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:20,600
-Come, come.
-Just up to the railing.

1638
02:27:20,900 --> 02:27:22,500
Thank you very much.

1639
02:27:24,900 --> 02:27:26,300
Now, sorry.

1640
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:28,700
Go on. "What shape it will take..."

1641
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:30,400
Jinnah has what?

1642
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:35,700
Jinnah has cooperated with the British.

1643
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:40,100
It has given him power
and the freedom to speak.

1644
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:42,900
And he's filled
the Muslims with fears...

1645
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:45,300
...of what will happen to them...

1646
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:48,500
...in a country that
is predominantly Hindu.

1647
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:52,100
And that I find hard to bear...

1648
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:54,100
...even in prison.

1649
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:56,000
Mr. Gandhi?

1650
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,600
It's hard for me to see this as a
cure for the 20th century's problems.

1651
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:09,900
I have friends who keep telling me...

1652
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:14,100
...how much it costs them
to keep me in poverty.

1653
02:28:15,900 --> 02:28:20,500
But I know happiness
does not come with things...

1654
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:22,400
...even 20th century things.

1655
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:27,300
It can come from work
and pride in what you do.

1656
02:28:28,300 --> 02:28:31,300
India lives in her villages...

1657
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:34,400
...and the terrible poverty there
can only be removed...

1658
02:28:34,600 --> 02:28:38,000
...if their local skills
can be revived.

1659
02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:41,400
Poverty is the worst form
of violence.

1660
02:28:42,100 --> 02:28:44,600
And a constructive program
is the only...

1661
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:48,100
...nonviolent solution
to India's agony.

1662
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:51,400
It will not necessarily be
progress for India...

1663
02:28:51,700 --> 02:28:56,000
...if she simply imports
the unhappiness of the West.

1664
02:28:58,600 --> 02:29:02,100
Do you really believe you could
use nonviolence against Hitler?

1665
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:07,400
Not without defeats and great pain.

1666
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:11,300
But are there no defeats in this war?

1667
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:12,900
No pain?

1668
02:29:14,700 --> 02:29:16,200
What you cannot do...

1669
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:19,100
...is accept injustice
from Hitler or anyone.

1670
02:29:19,300 --> 02:29:22,400
You must make the injustice visible.

1671
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:26,300
Be prepared to die
like a soldier to do so.

1672
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:32,500
Is this what I'm meant to
end up with here?

1673
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,100
That's what you get
for distracting me.

1674
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:38,400
What do you expect
when you talk like that?

1675
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:43,200
I expect you to show
as much patience as I am now.

1676
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:47,400
Turn slowly and pull it gently.

1677
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:55,600
And that includes the life of women.

1678
02:29:56,300 --> 02:29:59,100
Bapu has always said...

1679
02:29:59,300 --> 02:30:02,100
...there were two kinds
of slavery in India:

1680
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:06,300
One for women,
one for the untouchables.

1681
02:30:06,900 --> 02:30:10,100
And he has always fought against both.

1682
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:16,100
Does it rankle,
being separated in this way?

1683
02:30:19,700 --> 02:30:22,000
In Hindu philosophy...

1684
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:24,300
...the way to God...

1685
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:27,200
...is to free yourself
of possessions...

1686
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:29,600
...and of passions.

1687
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:34,900
Bapu has always struggled
to find the way to God.

1688
02:30:38,700 --> 02:30:42,800
Do you mean that
he gave up married life?

1689
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:48,200
Four times he tried...

1690
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:50,400
...and failed.

1691
02:30:52,100 --> 02:30:54,200
But then he took a solemn vow.

1692
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,200
And he's never broken it?

1693
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:02,900
Not yet.

1694
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:24,200
-I've got permission to move her.
-I'm very sorry, sir.

1695
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:27,200
She's had a massive thrombosis.
It's a serious heart attack.

1696
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:29,100
She'll never survive the trip.

1697
02:31:29,300 --> 02:31:32,200
It's better if we just
keep her here and hope.

1698
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:22,600
It's time for my walk.

1699
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,600
I won't be long.

1700
02:34:44,600 --> 02:34:45,400
Guard...

1701
02:34:45,900 --> 02:34:47,900
...present arms!

1702
02:35:04,113 --> 02:35:08,113
We have come to crown victory
with friendship.

1703
02:35:10,213 --> 02:35:13,413
To assist at the birth of
an independent India...

1704
02:35:13,713 --> 02:35:15,213
...and to welcome her
as an equal member...

1705
02:35:15,413 --> 02:35:17,813
...in the British Commonwealth
of Nations.

1706
02:35:19,113 --> 02:35:22,113
I am here to see that I am
the last British viceroy...

1707
02:35:22,313 --> 02:35:26,113
...ever to have the honour
of such a reception.

1708
02:35:38,613 --> 02:35:41,413
I am not concerned about
the independence of India.

1709
02:35:41,613 --> 02:35:43,813
I'm concerned about
the slavery of Muslims.

1710
02:35:44,113 --> 02:35:46,213
Please, Mr. Jinnah.

1711
02:35:46,413 --> 02:35:49,013
I won't watch the mastery
of the British...

1712
02:35:49,213 --> 02:35:51,513
...replaced by
the mastery of the Hindus.

1713
02:35:58,013 --> 02:36:02,113
Muslim and Hindu are the right
and left eye of India.

1714
02:36:02,613 --> 02:36:05,413
No one will be master, no one slave.

1715
02:36:05,713 --> 02:36:08,013
The world is not made of
Mahatma Ghandis.

1716
02:36:08,213 --> 02:36:09,913
I'm talking about the real world.

1717
02:36:10,113 --> 02:36:11,713
-How the--
-The real India has...

1718
02:36:12,013 --> 02:36:15,813
...Muslims and Hindus
in every village and every city.

1719
02:36:17,313 --> 02:36:18,613
How will you separate them?

1720
02:36:19,213 --> 02:36:22,213
Where there is a Muslim majority...

1721
02:36:22,513 --> 02:36:24,313
...that will be Pakistan.

1722
02:36:24,613 --> 02:36:27,113
The rest is your India.

1723
02:36:27,413 --> 02:36:28,413
My dear Jinnah...

1724
02:36:29,013 --> 02:36:32,913
...the Muslims are in a majority
on two different sides of the country.

1725
02:36:33,213 --> 02:36:37,213
Let us worry about Pakistan.
You worry about India.

1726
02:36:37,513 --> 02:36:38,513
Gentlemen...

1727
02:36:38,813 --> 02:36:40,913
...I think perhaps
we should recommence.

1728
02:36:55,213 --> 02:36:59,013
Death to Jinnah!
Death to Jinnah!

1729
02:37:26,513 --> 02:37:28,513
Thank God, they've stopped.

1730
02:37:31,913 --> 02:37:33,713
Manu. Abha.

1731
02:37:41,513 --> 02:37:43,113
I'm your granduncle...

1732
02:37:43,313 --> 02:37:46,713
...but I can still walk
either of you into the ground.

1733
02:37:46,913 --> 02:37:49,413
I don't need to be pampered
in this way.

1734
02:37:49,613 --> 02:37:51,813
Finish your quota of spinning.

1735
02:38:36,413 --> 02:38:38,113
Bapu, please don't do it.

1736
02:38:38,313 --> 02:38:41,013
What do you want me not to do?

1737
02:38:41,313 --> 02:38:43,413
Not to meet with Mr. Jinnah?

1738
02:38:45,213 --> 02:38:47,213
I am a Muslim...

1739
02:38:47,513 --> 02:38:48,513
...and a Hindu...

1740
02:38:49,113 --> 02:38:51,113
...and a Christian and a Jew.

1741
02:38:52,013 --> 02:38:54,413
And so are all of you.

1742
02:38:56,613 --> 02:38:59,413
When you wave those flags and shout...

1743
02:38:59,713 --> 02:39:02,913
...you send fear into the hearts
of your brothers.

1744
02:39:03,113 --> 02:39:05,113
That is not the India I want.

1745
02:39:05,413 --> 02:39:06,413
Stop it!

1746
02:39:06,713 --> 02:39:09,713
For God's sake, stop it.

1747
02:39:27,213 --> 02:39:29,013
If you've finished your prayers...

1748
02:39:29,213 --> 02:39:32,013
...perhaps we could begin
our business.

1749
02:39:36,213 --> 02:39:39,213
My dear Jinnah...

1750
02:39:39,413 --> 02:39:42,313
...you and I are brothers...

1751
02:39:42,513 --> 02:39:46,713
...born of the same mother India.
If you have fears...

1752
02:39:46,913 --> 02:39:50,013
...I want to put them at rest.

1753
02:39:50,313 --> 02:39:53,213
Begging the understanding
of my friends...

1754
02:39:53,813 --> 02:39:57,413
...I am asking Panditji
to stand down.

1755
02:39:57,813 --> 02:40:01,813
I want you to be
the first prime minister of India...

1756
02:40:02,013 --> 02:40:05,013
...to name your entire cabinet...

1757
02:40:05,213 --> 02:40:09,013
...to make the head of every
government department a Muslim.

1758
02:40:27,713 --> 02:40:29,813
For me and the rest...

1759
02:40:30,113 --> 02:40:32,213
...if that is what you want...

1760
02:40:32,413 --> 02:40:34,713
...we will accept it.

1761
02:40:35,913 --> 02:40:38,113
But out there...

1762
02:40:38,913 --> 02:40:40,513
...already there is rioting...

1763
02:40:40,713 --> 02:40:44,913
...because Hindus fear you are
going to give too much away.

1764
02:40:45,713 --> 02:40:47,813
If you did this...

1765
02:40:48,413 --> 02:40:50,813
...no one would control it.

1766
02:40:51,413 --> 02:40:52,913
No one.

1767
02:41:08,613 --> 02:41:10,313
It is your choice.

1768
02:41:11,713 --> 02:41:15,813
Do you want an independent India
and an independent Pakistan...

1769
02:41:16,213 --> 02:41:18,713
...or do you want civil war?

1770
02:41:55,513 --> 02:41:58,513
Jinnah! Jinnah! Jinnah!

1771
02:44:31,813 --> 02:44:35,313
What you did in Noakhali, Bapu,
was a miracle.

1772
02:44:35,713 --> 02:44:37,313
Miracle.

1773
02:44:37,813 --> 02:44:40,113
But millions are on the move...

1774
02:44:40,313 --> 02:44:42,413
...and no one can count the dead.

1775
02:44:44,713 --> 02:44:48,513
In Calcutta, it's like civil war.

1776
02:44:50,313 --> 02:44:53,913
The Muslims rose
and there was a bloodbath.

1777
02:44:55,013 --> 02:44:57,413
Now the Hindus are taking revenge.

1778
02:44:58,813 --> 02:45:00,313
If we can't stop it...

1779
02:45:00,513 --> 02:45:03,613
...there'll be no hope
for the Hindus left in Pakistan.

1780
02:45:04,813 --> 02:45:07,913
An eye for an eye,
making the whole world blind.

1781
02:45:10,213 --> 02:45:11,813
Aren't there any troops to spare?

1782
02:45:13,513 --> 02:45:14,413
Nothing.

1783
02:45:18,413 --> 02:45:19,613
Nothing.

1784
02:45:24,013 --> 02:45:26,913
The divisions in Bombay and Delhi
can hardly keep the peace now.

1785
02:45:27,213 --> 02:45:31,613
And each fresh bit of news creates
another wave of madness.

1786
02:45:31,813 --> 02:45:34,113
We could cut all news off.

1787
02:45:34,713 --> 02:45:36,313
Bapu, please, where are you going?

1788
02:45:36,913 --> 02:45:38,413
I don't want to hear more.

1789
02:45:39,813 --> 02:45:41,613
We need your help.

1790
02:45:42,113 --> 02:45:44,513
There is nothing I can give.

1791
02:45:47,613 --> 02:45:48,813
Where are you going?

1792
02:45:52,213 --> 02:45:53,613
Calcutta.

1793
02:46:36,913 --> 02:46:40,913
If I had shunned death or feared it,
I would not be here now...

1794
02:46:41,113 --> 02:46:43,213
...nor would you be concerned for me.

1795
02:46:43,413 --> 02:46:45,413
But, sir, please.

1796
02:46:45,613 --> 02:46:48,013
I don't have the men to protect you...

1797
02:46:48,213 --> 02:46:51,013
...not in a Muslim house,
not this quarter.

1798
02:46:51,213 --> 02:46:54,313
I'm staying with the friend
of a friend and--

1799
02:46:54,513 --> 02:46:58,513
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1800
02:47:00,013 --> 02:47:02,213
Why are you staying
at the home of a Muslim?

1801
02:47:02,413 --> 02:47:03,613
They are murderers!

1802
02:47:03,813 --> 02:47:05,013
They killed my family!

1803
02:47:05,313 --> 02:47:07,313
Get out of Calcutta, Gandhi!

1804
02:47:07,513 --> 02:47:10,313
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1805
02:47:59,113 --> 02:48:00,213
Prime Minister.

1806
02:48:05,213 --> 02:48:08,113
Why must I read news
like this in the paper?

1807
02:48:13,213 --> 02:48:15,813
Inform Sardar Patel.
Arrange a plane.

1808
02:48:16,313 --> 02:48:17,513
We will go Friday.

1809
02:48:18,413 --> 02:48:19,513
Four days, sir?

1810
02:48:53,313 --> 02:48:55,913
Sardar, you have gained weight.

1811
02:48:56,113 --> 02:48:58,313
You must join me in the fast.

1812
02:48:58,513 --> 02:49:00,913
If I fast, I die.

1813
02:49:01,613 --> 02:49:05,813
If you fast, people go to
all sorts of trouble...

1814
02:49:06,013 --> 02:49:07,213
...to keep you alive.

1815
02:49:08,513 --> 02:49:10,213
Bapu, forgive me, I've cheated.

1816
02:49:10,813 --> 02:49:12,913
I could have come earlier...

1817
02:49:13,113 --> 02:49:15,613
...but your fast has helped.

1818
02:49:16,113 --> 02:49:19,813
These last days, people's minds
have begun to turn to this bed...

1819
02:49:20,113 --> 02:49:22,113
...and away from the atrocities.

1820
02:49:22,313 --> 02:49:23,213
But now...

1821
02:49:24,313 --> 02:49:25,313
...it is enough.

1822
02:49:28,013 --> 02:49:32,313
All that has happened is that
I've grown a little thinner.

1823
02:49:35,913 --> 02:49:39,613
Tomorrow, 5000 Muslim students...

1824
02:49:39,813 --> 02:49:41,013
...of all ages...

1825
02:49:41,213 --> 02:49:44,913
...are marching here,
in Calcutta, for peace.

1826
02:49:45,713 --> 02:49:49,313
And 5000 Hindu students
are marching with them.

1827
02:49:50,413 --> 02:49:52,213
I'm glad.

1828
02:49:53,013 --> 02:49:55,913
But it will not be enough.

1829
02:50:11,613 --> 02:50:15,013
You are not so young anymore.

1830
02:50:15,513 --> 02:50:17,013
Don't worry for me.

1831
02:50:18,413 --> 02:50:23,013
I cannot watch the destruction
of all that I've lived for.

1832
02:51:32,313 --> 02:51:33,913
Death to Gandhi!

1833
02:51:34,113 --> 02:51:36,413
Who dares say such things?!

1834
02:51:36,813 --> 02:51:38,113
Who?!

1835
02:51:39,413 --> 02:51:42,213
You kill me first!

1836
02:51:43,213 --> 02:51:44,413
Come!

1837
02:51:47,213 --> 02:51:48,713
Where are you?!

1838
02:51:49,613 --> 02:51:51,313
Kill me first!

1839
02:51:54,313 --> 02:51:55,613
Where are you?

1840
02:52:06,113 --> 02:52:09,713
His pulse is very irregular.
The kidneys aren't functioning.

1841
02:52:25,213 --> 02:52:28,013
I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy.

1842
02:52:28,213 --> 02:52:32,113
It was he who called
on the Muslims to rise.

1843
02:52:32,413 --> 02:52:33,913
He is now telling them...

1844
02:52:34,513 --> 02:52:37,013
...to go back to their homes...

1845
02:52:37,213 --> 02:52:39,113
...to lay down their arms.

1846
02:52:51,613 --> 02:52:53,813
Think what you can do by living...

1847
02:52:54,113 --> 02:52:57,213
...that you cannot do by dying.

1848
02:53:06,813 --> 02:53:09,213
What do you want?

1849
02:53:12,613 --> 02:53:15,413
That the fighting will stop.

1850
02:53:15,613 --> 02:53:18,213
That you make me believe...

1851
02:53:21,113 --> 02:53:23,913
...that it will never start again.

1852
02:53:33,313 --> 02:53:34,413
Sometimes...

1853
02:53:34,613 --> 02:53:38,413
...it is when you are
quite without hope...

1854
02:53:39,113 --> 02:53:42,213
...and in utter darkness...

1855
02:53:42,913 --> 02:53:46,113
...that God comes to the rescue.

1856
02:53:48,013 --> 02:53:49,413
Gandhiji...

1857
02:53:49,913 --> 02:53:51,513
...is dying...

1858
02:53:53,313 --> 02:53:56,013
...because of our madness.

1859
02:53:57,913 --> 02:54:00,513
Put away your revenge.

1860
02:54:00,813 --> 02:54:05,413
What good will come of more killing?

1861
02:54:05,613 --> 02:54:08,013
Have the courage to do...

1862
02:54:08,213 --> 02:54:11,613
...what you know is right.

1863
02:54:12,113 --> 02:54:14,013
For God's sake...

1864
02:54:14,613 --> 02:54:18,613
...let us embrace like brothers.

1865
02:54:32,513 --> 02:54:34,313
It's our promise.

1866
02:54:35,113 --> 02:54:36,313
We stop.

1867
02:54:39,013 --> 02:54:41,013
Hindu swords.

1868
02:54:42,313 --> 02:54:43,913
It's a promise.

1869
02:54:47,113 --> 02:54:48,513
Go.

1870
02:54:50,313 --> 02:54:51,713
God be with you.

1871
02:55:04,713 --> 02:55:06,113
Here, eat!

1872
02:55:07,613 --> 02:55:08,613
Eat!

1873
02:55:10,313 --> 02:55:11,813
I'm going to hell...

1874
02:55:12,213 --> 02:55:14,913
...but not with your death on my soul.

1875
02:55:15,513 --> 02:55:18,813
Only God decides who goes to hell.

1876
02:55:19,213 --> 02:55:21,113
I killed a child.

1877
02:55:22,713 --> 02:55:25,513
I smashed his head against a wall.

1878
02:55:27,313 --> 02:55:28,513
Why?

1879
02:55:30,713 --> 02:55:32,513
They killed my son.

1880
02:55:35,613 --> 02:55:37,013
My boy.

1881
02:55:39,313 --> 02:55:41,513
The Muslims killed my son!

1882
02:55:46,413 --> 02:55:50,113
I know a way out of hell.

1883
02:55:51,513 --> 02:55:53,913
Find a child.

1884
02:55:54,213 --> 02:55:59,213
A child whose mother and father
have been killed.

1885
02:55:59,613 --> 02:56:04,013
A little boy about this high...

1886
02:56:05,713 --> 02:56:08,313
...and raise him as your own.

1887
02:56:12,013 --> 02:56:15,313
Only be sure that he is a Muslim...

1888
02:56:17,113 --> 02:56:20,313
...and that you raise him as one.

1889
02:56:48,013 --> 02:56:48,813
Go.

1890
02:56:50,313 --> 02:56:51,113
Go.

1891
02:56:53,213 --> 02:56:54,713
God bless you.

1892
02:57:21,513 --> 02:57:22,413
Bapu?

1893
02:57:29,013 --> 02:57:31,313
There's been no fighting...

1894
02:57:32,013 --> 02:57:33,013
...anywhere.

1895
02:57:34,413 --> 02:57:35,813
It's stopped.

1896
02:57:36,613 --> 02:57:39,213
The madness has stopped.

1897
02:57:43,313 --> 02:57:44,913
It's foolish...

1898
02:57:45,113 --> 02:57:48,713
...if it's just to save
the life of an old man.

1899
02:57:49,013 --> 02:57:54,013
No. In every temple and mosque...

1900
02:57:54,413 --> 02:57:56,413
...they have pledged to die...

1901
02:57:56,713 --> 02:57:59,713
...before they lift a hand
against each other.

1902
02:58:02,213 --> 02:58:04,013
It is true, Bapu.

1903
02:58:12,113 --> 02:58:13,913
Everywhere.

1904
02:58:48,613 --> 02:58:50,913
Maulana, my friend...

1905
02:58:53,013 --> 02:58:55,513
...could I have some orange juice?

1906
02:59:02,413 --> 02:59:04,113
Then you and I...

1907
02:59:04,313 --> 02:59:07,113
...will take a piece
of bread together.

1908
02:59:37,413 --> 02:59:39,613
He will be saying prayers
in the garden.

1909
02:59:48,113 --> 02:59:49,913
That is how you eat muli.

1910
02:59:50,813 --> 02:59:53,413
I'm not sure that I want
to be remembered that way.

1911
02:59:53,613 --> 02:59:55,713
Don't worry.
With luck, you may not be.

1912
02:59:55,913 --> 02:59:59,613
No, he will be remembered
for tempting fate.

1913
03:00:00,713 --> 03:00:02,613
Mickey Mouse!

1914
03:00:03,813 --> 03:00:05,813
You're really going to Pakistan?

1915
03:00:10,713 --> 03:00:12,513
You are a stubborn man.

1916
03:00:14,613 --> 03:00:16,613
I'm simply going to prove...

1917
03:00:16,813 --> 03:00:19,413
...to Hindus here and Muslims there...

1918
03:00:19,613 --> 03:00:22,813
...that the only devils
in the world are those...

1919
03:00:23,113 --> 03:00:25,613
...running around in our own hearts.

1920
03:00:26,113 --> 03:00:29,613
And that is where all our battles
ought to be fought.

1921
03:00:37,213 --> 03:00:42,013
So, what kind of warrior have you
been in that warfare?

1922
03:00:43,713 --> 03:00:45,413
Not a very good one.

1923
03:00:45,613 --> 03:00:48,313
That's why I have
so much tolerance...

1924
03:00:48,513 --> 03:00:51,813
...for the other scoundrels
of the world.

1925
03:00:56,213 --> 03:00:57,113
Sardar?

1926
03:00:58,013 --> 03:01:01,613
Ask Panditji to consider
what we've discussed.

1927
03:01:08,013 --> 03:01:10,213
-Enough!
-One more.

1928
03:01:10,613 --> 03:01:13,313
-You're a temptress!
-Just an admirer.

1929
03:01:13,513 --> 03:01:15,613
Nothing's more dangerous...

1930
03:01:15,913 --> 03:01:18,113
...especially for an old man.

1931
03:01:27,513 --> 03:01:29,713
There's a sadness about him.

1932
03:01:31,313 --> 03:01:32,913
He thinks he's failed.

1933
03:01:33,113 --> 03:01:34,513
Why?

1934
03:01:34,813 --> 03:01:38,213
If anything's proven him right,
it's these last months.

1935
03:01:40,013 --> 03:01:42,513
I may be blinded by my love for him...

1936
03:01:43,313 --> 03:01:44,513
...but I believe...

1937
03:01:44,813 --> 03:01:47,013
...when we most needed it...

1938
03:01:47,213 --> 03:01:50,313
...he offered the world
a way out of madness.

1939
03:01:53,113 --> 03:01:54,413
But he doesn't see it.

1940
03:01:55,413 --> 03:01:57,313
Neither does the world.

1941
03:02:30,813 --> 03:02:32,913
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

1942
03:02:35,713 --> 03:02:37,513
Oh, God!

1943
03:02:38,313 --> 03:02:40,313
Oh, God.

1944
03:03:19,013 --> 03:03:21,013
When I despair...

1945
03:03:21,313 --> 03:03:23,213
...I remember...

1946
03:03:23,513 --> 03:03:25,813
... that all through history...

1947
03:03:26,013 --> 03:03:30,513
... the way of truth and love
has always won.

1948
03:03:32,313 --> 03:03:35,913
There have been tyrants
and murderers...

1949
03:03:36,213 --> 03:03:39,213
...and for a time,
they can seem invincible...

1950
03:03:39,413 --> 03:03:42,813
...but in the end, they always fall.

1951
03:03:44,513 --> 03:03:46,113
Think of it.

1952
03:03:47,813 --> 03:03:49,513
Always.
