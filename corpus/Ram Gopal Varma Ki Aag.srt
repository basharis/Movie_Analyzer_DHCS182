1
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:41,729
Some people live a wretched life!

2
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:45,172
And some people live by killing!

3
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:51,209
Babban... was such a man.

4
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:57,312
No!

5
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:04,326
You all know what he did with me.

6
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:09,065
My life has only one aim!

7
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:12,431
Revenge from Babban!

8
00:01:17,242 --> 00:01:22,236
And for that... fate
send both of them.

9
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:27,281
Heero and Raj!

10
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:47,001
Greetings, sir! Let me
carry your luggage!

11
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:48,130
Give!

12
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:51,335
Hey! First tell me how
much will you charge?

13
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:53,900
Sir, don't abuse me!
Money is volatile!

14
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,037
Today here! Tomorrow there!

15
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:56,910
I don't know where it will
be day after tomorrow!

16
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:58,006
Come on!

17
00:01:58,116 --> 00:01:59,174
Take both of them!

18
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:01,076
300 rupees!

19
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:02,278
- 300 rupees!
- Yes!

20
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:05,281
But inside you were saying we
are guests. Guest is God.

21
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:06,949
So God only gives the offering!

22
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:08,959
Hey! Come on! Give me 300 rupees!

23
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,154
The train is about to arrive!
I don't have much time!

24
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,356
- What if we don't pay?
- What?

25
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:14,955
What if we don't pay?

26
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:18,025
I will whistle... and my entire
gang will arrive here!

27
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:20,833
You both will leave in an ambulance
and not in this cab!

28
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:22,132
Got it! Come on! Don't talk too much!

29
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:23,836
- Give me money! Come on!
- Whistle!

30
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:27,035
Where is your gang?

31
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:31,982
Scoundrel! We have come to
Mumbai for the first time!

32
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,984
So you think we are fools!

33
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:39,112
We have seen 3000 samples like you!

34
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,083
Now get lost! Come on!

35
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:43,990
Listen! Come here!

36
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,988
- Here!
- Let it be, sir!

37
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:47,656
Keep it! You have earned it!

38
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,125
Now get lost!

39
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:52,866
I think we will gel well with Mumbai!

40
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:55,799
Where is Rambha-bhai's address?

41
00:02:56,074 --> 00:03:00,272
You thought that Rambha-bhai
will help you.

42
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:02,312
You are wrong!

43
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,373
I am the goon of Mumbai!
Not some ordinary man!

44
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:08,683
What are you doing?

45
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:15,352
Supplying guns is my side business.

46
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:17,224
It's just a matter of a few days.

47
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:21,288
Once I get promoted to
the post of a shooter...

48
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,759
Rambha-bhai, somebody
has come to meet you!

49
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:30,366
Heero! Darling! You and here?

50
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,943
Yes! I had to come!

51
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:34,308
And he too has come along with me!

52
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:36,170
Raj!

53
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:38,176
Rambha-bhai!

54
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,345
What happened, darling? Is
everything fine in Nasik?

55
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:45,247
Was? What about the present?

56
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:49,921
After that Heero-bhai was in trouble.

57
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,195
And he had a fight with some enemies.

58
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:57,058
I made a mistake. I
thrashed a policeman!

59
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,006
Darling... you were working as Mr.
Sahil, that MLA's bodyguard!

60
00:04:06,077 --> 00:04:07,135
- He went away!
- Where?

61
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:08,702
- In a scam!
- Scam?

62
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:14,774
- Get me a nice job!
- Job? Nice?

63
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:17,711
That too in Mumbai? For you both?

64
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:19,957
Come on, darling! Leave! Go!

65
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:26,028
But Heero-bhai... you said this
Rambha... is a useful man.

66
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,133
I am the most useful man!

67
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:33,034
Job is not a girl of my locality!

68
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:36,733
That I call her and she will come!
Am I right, darling!

69
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:40,671
Rambha-bhai! We don't need
a girl! We need a job!

70
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:43,981
- And the payment too should be good!
- Is that so?

71
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:46,277
And the job too should be simple!

72
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:48,675
Anything else? Meals included?

73
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:54,250
Darlings, I will think of something!

74
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:58,718
Why did you both come to Mumbai?

75
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:00,055
If we had thought, then we wouldn't...

76
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:00,989
have come to Mumbai, sir.

77
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:05,293
Darling!

78
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:07,195
Are you both alone?

79
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:09,263
When we both are together,
how can we be alone?

80
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,672
Bhai, he means to say that
they both together...

81
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:13,870
will do abundant work for you!

82
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,410
They both are all-rounder!

83
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:18,609
Driver cum bodyguard cum,
jack of all trades.

84
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,048
They will be your special men
round the clock, darling.

85
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,224
Advance.

86
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,961
Hey! Make arrangement of their stay!

87
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:41,096
Love you, darling!

88
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,102
He paid us advance handsomely.

89
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:46,003
We didn't earn so much even
in 6 months in Nasik!

90
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:49,169
Bowled! Now throw the
ball! It's my turn!

91
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:52,774
- Hey!
- That's why we have come to Mumbai!

92
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,849
We are concerned just
with earning money!

93
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:57,380
Whether we get the work from
Mr. Shambhu or Bambu!

94
00:05:58,256 --> 00:05:59,314
What difference does that make?

95
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:00,715
You are right!

96
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,922
"We will live countless moments
in this short life."

97
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:09,057
"When Raj and Heero are there,
there is no problem."

98
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:10,897
"The whole world will take notice."

99
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:12,960
"We will do such a deed."

100
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:16,766
"If we can't do anything,
then no problem."

101
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:19,005
"We will sing."

102
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:20,977
"Whatever we want."

103
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:24,606
"No matter how, no problem."

104
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:31,680
"Friend!"

105
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,729
"We will forget the memories."

106
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:47,635
"All day, all night we will
forget all the things."

107
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,871
"We will look at beautiful girls."

108
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:55,845
"And give solace to our eyes."

109
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:59,074
"I will entice her."

110
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,141
"You can't entice her."

111
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:03,015
"I will entice another girl."

112
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,714
"No problem, friend."

113
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,886
"There is no problem."

114
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,654
"Hey! What style!"

115
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:14,665
"We will live now."

116
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:16,324
"We will live now."

117
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,263
"We will live now."

118
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:20,600
"Now smile."

119
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:22,098
"We will live now."

120
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:23,606
"We will live now."

121
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:24,733
"We will live now."

122
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:25,934
"We will live now."

123
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:27,941
"We will live now."

124
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:29,036
"We will live now."

125
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:30,808
"We will live now."

126
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:41,614
You people think the
police didn't do...

127
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:43,752
the right thing by nabbing you both.

128
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:48,989
Yes! Because the police does less
duty... and more mistakes.

129
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,125
Correct!

130
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:57,198
- You mean... you both are innocent.
- Yes!

131
00:07:57,308 --> 00:07:59,367
I am in the police force
for the past 20 years.

132
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,646
And for the past 20 years...
I have been...

133
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:06,343
hearing the same thing
from criminals.

134
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:07,948
It's not about what you say or hear!

135
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:09,278
It's about the truth!

136
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,884
And we both are telling the truth!

137
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:13,315
Yes!

138
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,204
I think they both are innocent!

139
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:37,614
But, sir! If that is the
case then how come...

140
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,117
they both are working
for Mr. Shambhu?

141
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:47,984
Why are you both working
for Mr. Shambhu?

142
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:50,922
Because he is a straight man!

143
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:54,197
And he also pays us handsomely!

144
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:58,992
You both never thought...
why he pays so much?

145
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,897
Why should we think?
He is giving, fine!

146
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,371
But what do you mean?

147
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:09,143
Have you heard Bhai Zakar's name?

148
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:11,642
He is UP's biggest gangster!

149
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,775
In Mumbai Shambhu works for him!

150
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,783
The police are after Shambhu
for the past 5 years!

151
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,653
More than 40 murder cases and...

152
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,251
many kidnappings charges
are against him.

153
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:28,363
But we never found any
evidence against him!

154
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,194
You just think.

155
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,662
What is unique about you both?

156
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:35,331
What is your qualification?

157
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,198
What is your experience?

158
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,977
That he is paying
you both handsomely!

159
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:44,272
He is paying because he
wants to buy you both!

160
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:47,775
He wants you both to keep mum!

161
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:51,945
It's not necessary for you
people to believe me!

162
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:55,286
You people are working for him.

163
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:59,962
He must have seen something
in you both.

164
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,432
What I am saying...
how far it is true?

165
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:08,430
You only think!

166
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,302
You talk about the truth!

167
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,938
So try to understand the truth too!

168
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:19,282
If you understand it...
help the police.

169
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:28,191
Remember that day Mr.
Shambhu had called.

170
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,318
At Saki Naka.

171
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:34,128
And after making the call,
he threw the phone.

172
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,291
Yes!

173
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:15,263
Yes!

174
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:57,714
Sir, you can't get better cocaine
than this all over the world.

175
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,021
Seems like I have seen you before.

176
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:12,227
I think I have never seen you before.

177
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:15,730
Then everything is fine,
what is the problem.

178
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,093
What is your name?

179
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,731
Gonsalves, Anthony Gonsalves.

180
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:26,743
- Amar, Amar Akbar.
- And I am Rambha-bhai.

181
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:39,309
You scoundrel.

182
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:19,609
- Inspector sir.
- If we try to save him...

183
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,912
then we will be killed.

184
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:32,755
Tell me clearly, are you
a goon or the police.

185
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:36,357
Or else I will shoot you.

186
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:39,625
Just a minute, just a minute,
just a minute...

187
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:43,299
if you want, you can shoot me.

188
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:47,635
But before your bullets
can reach me...

189
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:52,843
brother Heero will shoot Shambhu.

190
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,984
- Where is he?
- Behind those boxes.

191
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,653
Or behind those doors.

192
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:02,787
Or he can be under the ground too.

193
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,654
Stop confusing me, and tell me
clearly what you want to do.

194
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,664
Let us all sit and think...

195
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:08,790
we will find someone solution.

196
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:12,325
What is that noise?
What is that noise?

197
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:14,166
It is not the police.

198
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:16,297
I am telling you it
is not the police.

199
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:38,627
And now we will join the police too.

200
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,254
Yes.

201
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:45,226
Come on.

202
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:47,862
I am helpless to arrest you both.

203
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,634
Knowingly or unknowingly,
according to the law...

204
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,042
you both worked for Shambhu.

205
00:16:57,948 --> 00:16:59,643
I will try my best that both of you...

206
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:02,083
are given minimum sentence.

207
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:04,712
Thanks.

208
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:10,390
Thanks for everything.

209
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,071
"If you have the courage,
come ahead."

210
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,700
"Move ahead."

211
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:29,610
"Lock horns with fire."

212
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:31,706
"If you have the courage,
come ahead."

213
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:33,114
"Move ahead."

214
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,051
"Look straight in the eye."

215
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:42,351
"Move ahead."

216
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:47,355
"Look straight in the eye."

217
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:53,003
"If you have the courage,
come ahead."

218
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:56,698
"Look straight in the eye."

219
00:17:56,807 --> 00:18:03,371
"This is a fire..."

220
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:07,843
"This is a fire..."

221
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:13,815
"This will not stop..."

222
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:17,223
"This will not extinguish..."

223
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:20,161
"This is a fire..."

224
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:27,730
"No one make the mistake
of touching it."

225
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:30,898
"Smoke is everywhere..."

226
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:35,809
"How can you breath in this fire?."

227
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:42,846
"This is a fire..."

228
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:07,769
What did I tell you?

229
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:12,948
Brother, that don... do you know him?

230
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,213
He offered me a job.

231
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:18,246
They asked me to join the gang.

232
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:24,216
- But I said no.
- But why?

233
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:28,657
Because Rambha-bhai doesn't
work under anyone...

234
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,791
only gives orders, darling.

235
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,697
That's why I became Mumbai's
biggest goon.

236
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,032
Biggest goon, but I never heard
your name ever before.

237
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:43,170
Illiterate person, that's
why I am the biggest goon!

238
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:47,775
Otherwise I would be
locked in the jail.

239
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:49,815
But you are in jail right now.

240
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,879
I came on my own will darling.

241
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:59,427
Sometimes in the underworld,
you have to go underground.

242
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:01,763
By why did you have
to go underground?

243
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:05,063
This is not the time to help anyone.

244
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:08,400
That police commissioner
is my friend.

245
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:10,730
I thought that I should help him.

246
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:14,772
He wanted to catch two very
dangerous terrorists.

247
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,639
So for doing a good
deed I helped him...

248
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:21,139
they both were caught but,
the matter reached Delhi.

249
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:24,186
And after Delhi, America's
C.I.A got involved.

250
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:26,654
4-5 countries called for
a meeting together...

251
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:27,782
the presidents.

252
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:31,688
So helplessly, India
had to surrender me.

253
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:33,220
Really.

254
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:35,322
Something terrible happened
after that.

255
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:39,233
After that America's C.I.A and
the Al-Qaida had a meeting.

256
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:41,828
America's C.I.A and the Al-Qaida.

257
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,736
Yes. Because I am so wanted darling.

258
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,367
This is a very big quagmire.

259
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:52,915
- Where was I?
- In the meeting.

260
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:59,288
After that, both of them forgot
their enmity and came after me.

261
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,422
Who is it, you are ruining my hair.

262
00:21:02,926 --> 00:21:04,951
America's C.I.A, you scoundrel.

263
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:08,192
And Al-Qaida, here.

264
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:12,096
You scoundrel, we trusted you
and now we have been arrested.

265
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:15,036
Darling, I have been arrested too.

266
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:21,634
Listen to me carefully,
from today for one year...

267
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:25,648
we will hit you on the
head, and you will...

268
00:21:25,682 --> 00:21:28,845
keep getting shorter inch by inch.

269
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,211
No!

270
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,317
How are you?

271
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:39,160
- You were not there last time.
- I was right here.

272
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:40,287
What are you saying?

273
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:42,823
He was taller then us.

274
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:52,672
"This is a fire..."

275
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,872
"This is a fire..."

276
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:59,805
"This is a fire..."

277
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:06,689
"This will not stop..."

278
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:09,921
"This will not extinguish..."

279
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:14,227
"This is a fire..."

280
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,997
"No one make the mistake
of touching it."

281
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,798
"Smoke is everywhere..."

282
00:22:21,872 --> 00:22:26,639
"How can you breath in this fire?."

283
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:32,172
Inspector sir.

284
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,775
Please don't say that you have
come to arrest us again.

285
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:37,252
Now I am not in the police.

286
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:42,258
Congratulations.

287
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:51,192
How?

288
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:54,670
- Accident.
- What happened?

289
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:56,735
There is no need for
you to know that.

290
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,133
Then why did you want to meet us.

291
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:00,267
There is a work.

292
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,676
Last time we worked for you,
we were jailed for a year.

293
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:05,275
How many years now.

294
00:23:05,315 --> 00:23:08,375
I told you, I am not
in the police now.

295
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:13,880
What is the work and what will we get?

296
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,057
8 lakh.

297
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,960
Because that's all I have.

298
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:26,193
What is the work?

299
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:29,968
The entire countries
police are confused.

300
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:35,142
And he asks us, get me Babban.

301
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:37,180
Yes sir, do you want anything else?

302
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:39,943
Bring a Babban fry.

303
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,143
That famous gangster.

304
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:45,885
Go, bring the bill.

305
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:48,789
We should have laughed at the
inspector like this too.

306
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:51,654
If you give it a thought,
the money is not bad.

307
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:53,656
You fool, if we don't catch Babban...

308
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,391
then how will we get the money.

309
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:57,663
We have just come out of the jail...

310
00:23:57,734 --> 00:24:00,100
and we don't have any work too.

311
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:03,373
Why don't we try?

312
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,272
What is the harm?

313
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:07,236
Shall we toss?

314
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:16,042
Let us go.

315
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:26,820
Will you take us to Kaliganj?

316
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:29,161
Brother, Kaliganj.

317
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,305
Rajnikant, is the auto empty.

318
00:24:40,377 --> 00:24:43,642
No, the bedbugs are getting
married in the backseat...

319
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,341
can't you see?

320
00:24:47,184 --> 00:24:49,049
Smarty, where is the driver?

321
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:52,817
Are you blind or insane?

322
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:58,656
What do you think,
I am sitting here...

323
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:01,391
to entertain boys like you.

324
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:04,091
I am the driver.

325
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:07,936
But you are a girl.

326
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:09,666
So, is it written in
the Bhagvad Gita...

327
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,334
that girls cannot drive the rickshaw.

328
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,937
Let's talk business, where
do you want to go?

329
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:19,138
Kaliganj, you do know
the way don't you?

330
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,915
I know it since I was this small.

331
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:25,716
- Ask me how?
- Really, how?

332
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:32,052
Because I was born there.

333
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,055
We have to go to inspector
Narsimha's house.

334
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:37,358
Don't say that you know him too.

335
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:38,965
I was so small.

336
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:43,231
But how?

337
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:47,738
Because she was born there.

338
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:49,972
You like to talk nonsense.

339
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,875
Let it be, my friend likes to joke.

340
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,317
Ask your friend to keep
his jokes to himself.

341
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,019
Ghungroo doesn't like jokes.

342
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:00,147
Did you hear?

343
00:26:01,058 --> 00:26:03,151
What do you like Ghungroo?

344
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:04,284
Don't act to smart.

345
00:26:04,828 --> 00:26:10,266
Is this meter just for showpiece,
it doesn't work.

346
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:14,796
On the way to Kaliganj, there
are a lot of potholes.

347
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,735
And you will be completely shaken
while reaching there.

348
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:19,867
Really.

349
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:21,808
And if the axel breaks, then
the expenses will be...

350
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:23,636
Double.

351
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:25,714
I will have to give the
rickshaw in the garage.

352
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:28,616
Not by the meter, it
will cost you 200...

353
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:30,779
fine if you agree, or you can leave.

354
00:26:30,987 --> 00:26:32,784
Okay, then we will take
another rickshaw.

355
00:26:32,856 --> 00:26:33,914
Keep quiet!

356
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:37,050
My friend is a bit miser,
we want to go.

357
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:41,021
At the back.

358
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:42,156
Come on.

359
00:26:47,104 --> 00:26:48,196
Can I help you?

360
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,371
Ghungroo never takes
anyone else's help!

361
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:54,834
But who is this Ghungroo?

362
00:26:55,245 --> 00:26:57,645
- I already told him that...
- She has been saying it...

363
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:00,343
for so long, you are acting to smart.

364
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:05,881
- Sorry Ghungroo, shall we go?
- When did I say no?

365
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:18,059
Ghungroo, you drive the auto so well.

366
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:20,964
Even the male drivers
are no match for you.

367
00:27:21,037 --> 00:27:22,732
- Do you know why?
- Why?

368
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:24,600
Because I have been
driving the auto...

369
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:27,609
since I had to look after my house.

370
00:27:30,113 --> 00:27:32,604
Quiet, you talk so much.

371
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:34,608
Why is Laila written on the auto?

372
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:36,350
Because the name of
the auto is Lalia.

373
00:27:36,787 --> 00:27:39,620
I have kept it according
to the numerology.

374
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:41,623
If someone castes a
bad eye on the auto...

375
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:43,682
then it won't be harmed.

376
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:51,057
Inspector sir's house has come.

377
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:54,166
And here is your 200 rupees.

378
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:57,035
- Give me 150.
- But...

379
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,104
But we had decided on 200 rupees.

380
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:01,644
It was, but you are good people...

381
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:05,340
and you are the guests
of the inspector.

382
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:09,016
- So I was thinking...
- Thank you for the discount.

383
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:10,382
No, no, keep it.

384
00:28:11,054 --> 00:28:13,113
- What happened?
- Don't touch.

385
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:19,986
Mr. Shyam, this is Heero
and this is Raj.

386
00:28:20,063 --> 00:28:21,257
They have come to meet the inspector.

387
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:35,737
- This is 1 lakh.
- But you said 8 lakh.

388
00:28:35,946 --> 00:28:39,040
I said 8 lakh for the work,
this is advance.

389
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:50,151
I am going to the clinic.

390
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:54,024
Would you like to have something?

391
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,202
- You.
- Coffee.

392
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,635
Being near the sea, this piece
of land in Kaliganj...

393
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:09,872
have become priceless.

394
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:15,341
And now Babban has cast
his sight on this land.

395
00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:17,644
The people that live here...

396
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:21,054
have been living here for
many ages and not years.

397
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:24,660
That's why they are not ready
to leave this place...

398
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:26,320
at any cost.

399
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:32,965
If you can help them in
protecting this land...

400
00:29:33,036 --> 00:29:35,129
First he asks us to catch Babban.

401
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:38,674
Then he asks us to protect the land.

402
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:44,013
I am fully assured that the
inspector is completely insane.

403
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,275
Atleast we got advance.

404
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:47,681
When we are not going
to do the work...

405
00:29:47,717 --> 00:29:48,979
then what is the use of the advance.

406
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:50,953
Have you lost your mind?

407
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:56,083
We came here, this money is for that.

408
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,683
That means after taking the money...

409
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:01,723
Bravo.

410
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:04,966
Have another drink, it is free too.

411
00:30:05,735 --> 00:30:07,999
As soon as everyone falls
asleep, we will...

412
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:23,646
It is not your mistake,
inspector sir...

413
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,813
made a mistake by calling you here.

414
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:32,661
He is living in the
misconception that...

415
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:36,165
anyone will come and help
him in this battle.

416
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:41,827
I have only one request to you.

417
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:46,265
Take the money that inspector
sir has given you.

418
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:55,846
But find a way so
that he is not hurt.

419
00:30:58,154 --> 00:31:00,054
He has tolerated a lot.

420
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:05,694
He doesn't have the strength
to tolerate anything else...

421
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:07,093
nor do I to see it.

422
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:46,700
Who lives in this house?

423
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:48,861
Inspector sir and madam.

424
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:50,864
And the others?

425
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,271
Babban killed everyone else.

426
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:15,358
Devi, we have decided to stay here!

427
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,776
We had come just to say...
that we will live here!

428
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:57,936
- Rehmad!
- Yes, father!

429
00:32:58,007 --> 00:32:59,065
Where is the scissors?

430
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:00,869
Scissors! Scissors!

431
00:33:01,077 --> 00:33:02,408
Did you pay the electricity bill?

432
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,374
Father, I went there twice.

433
00:33:04,814 --> 00:33:06,304
The first time there
was a long queue!

434
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:08,316
And the second time... it was Sunday!

435
00:33:08,384 --> 00:33:11,785
Very good! Now you can't
even remember the days!

436
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:13,413
Where is your mind nowadays?

437
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:15,691
- Shall I tell you?
- You?

438
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:17,118
- No, no!
- Tell me!

439
00:33:18,294 --> 00:33:20,194
- Shall I tell you?
- Yes, dear!

440
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,895
In looking after you! What else?

441
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:25,366
Looking after me? Don't joke, dear!

442
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:29,302
Rehmad wastes his time on all
nonsense things in the world.

443
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:30,899
Except on himself.

444
00:33:31,775 --> 00:33:32,833
And suddenly he disappears.

445
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:34,376
Without informing anybody!

446
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:36,976
- Shall I tell him where you had gone?
- No, no! - What?

447
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,844
He comes to me! For advice!

448
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:43,316
I give him some wisdom.

449
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:46,651
What is right in life, what is wrong!

450
00:33:48,124 --> 00:33:50,820
Ahmed, learn! Learn something
from Ghungroo!

451
00:33:50,894 --> 00:33:52,384
What is called responsibility!

452
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:54,724
Being a girl, she runs
the entire household!

453
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:56,197
Time for prayers!

454
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:58,197
You will have to get married!

455
00:33:58,268 --> 00:34:01,066
The entire Kaliganj trembles on
hearing Gangu mummy's name!

456
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:02,729
And you don't even listen to me!

457
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,167
Mummy! You have asked
me so many times!

458
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:08,802
And I have told you so many times!
I don't want to marry!

459
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:13,073
Since when that Tukaram's
family is after us!

460
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:15,307
He has his own general store!
At the corner of the street!

461
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:17,148
The guy is nice! Hey!

462
00:34:18,221 --> 00:34:20,712
So you want me to marry
a general store vendor?

463
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:25,359
Now it's enough! Hey! Explain
to your daughter!

464
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:29,689
If she behaved like this then not
even a fool will marry Ghungroo!

465
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:38,030
- You have a gun?
- Then what!

466
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:40,302
This is great! From
where did you get it?

467
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:41,638
When I was returning from America...

468
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:44,236
I stopped over at Iraq
and bought it from there!

469
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,280
It must be difficult to shoot.

470
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:50,116
It's easy! Really easy!

471
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:53,381
You see I was in the police
force and army too!

472
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:55,382
Your shirt is good!

473
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:57,190
This is enough!

474
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:59,761
You were in the police
force and army too?

475
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:02,054
Yes! Do you want to learn?

476
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:04,190
Me? Will I be able to use the gun?

477
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:06,667
Ghungroo... when being a girl
you can ride the auto...

478
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:08,966
then using the gun is nothing!

479
00:35:12,408 --> 00:35:14,205
You are right! Come on!

480
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:24,653
The first rule in shooting is...
to concentrate on the aim.

481
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:27,616
You should not concentrate on
what is happening around you.

482
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,748
Why?

483
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:33,019
What do I know? It's the rule! Yes!

484
00:35:46,376 --> 00:35:49,038
- Wink!
- Wink?

485
00:35:49,078 --> 00:35:54,141
I mean... close your left eye...
and aim with the right eye!

486
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:57,883
What? Come on!

487
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:16,204
- You are really too much!
- What happened?

488
00:36:16,272 --> 00:36:18,001
What happened? I know everything!

489
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:19,803
Where is your attention and your aim!

490
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,275
Hey! Ghungroo!

491
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:23,035
Hey! Ghungroo!

492
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:24,608
O Ghungroo!

493
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:26,012
Ghungroo!

494
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:27,708
Ghungroo!

495
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,808
"Stop!"

496
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:31,045
"Where are you going?."

497
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,647
"Why are you angry?."

498
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,953
"Hey you! Get lost!"

499
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:40,018
"Why are you after me?."

500
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:42,621
"Move from my way!"

501
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,230
"Why are you upset?."

502
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:48,236
"Why are you quarrelling?."

503
00:36:48,371 --> 00:36:50,236
"You don't understand. What to do?."

504
00:36:50,306 --> 00:36:51,967
"What to do?."

505
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:01,946
"Stop!"

506
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:04,246
"Where are you going?."

507
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,847
"Why are you angry?."

508
00:37:08,691 --> 00:37:11,159
" Hey you! Get lost!"

509
00:37:11,227 --> 00:37:13,195
"Why are you after me?."

510
00:37:13,262 --> 00:37:15,787
" Move from my way!"

511
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:26,972
"You are Jhansi Ki Rani."

512
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:29,041
"You are Hitler's grandma."

513
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:31,044
" Bruce Lee's student."

514
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:32,807
"Ghungroo!"

515
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,247
"You are the King of goons."

516
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,347
"You are useless."

517
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:39,618
"You are a bluff master!"

518
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:41,285
"Heero!"

519
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:44,225
"Don't make an issue out of nothing!"

520
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:46,284
"Do you think I am an idiot?."

521
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:50,893
"What to think? You are an idiot!"

522
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:01,034
- "Why are you acting smugly?
- What?."

523
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,975
- "It happens at times!
- Is that so?."

524
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,979
"Just take it easy."

525
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:06,242
"Ghungroo!"

526
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:08,344
"I swear."

527
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:10,676
"I won't spare you!"

528
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,719
"I will drive the auto over you!"

529
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:14,387
"Heero!"

530
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:17,626
"I am an innocent and simple man."

531
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:19,991
"Go and fool somebody else."

532
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:22,588
"It's just a misunderstanding."

533
00:38:32,008 --> 00:38:33,202
"Stop!"

534
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:36,109
"Where are you going?."

535
00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:38,909
"Why are you angry?."

536
00:38:40,016 --> 00:38:42,678
"Hey you! Get lost!"

537
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:44,617
"Why are you after me?."

538
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:47,349
"Move from my way!"

539
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:50,886
"Why are you upset?."

540
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,860
"Why are you quarrelling?."

541
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:54,895
"You don't understand. What to do?."

542
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:56,329
"What to do?."

543
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:00,059
Inspector!

544
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:03,029
Inspector!

545
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:05,869
Inspector! Tambhe had called!

546
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:07,834
What did he say?

547
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,376
He is sending Dhania tomorrow.

548
00:39:18,387 --> 00:39:23,950
He is Pradhan.
Everybody respects him.

549
00:39:27,163 --> 00:39:28,289
Babban thinks that...

550
00:39:29,198 --> 00:39:32,190
By pressurizing him, his
work will be done!

551
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:39,371
Hit the iron when it's hot!

552
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:49,208
Yes!

553
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,677
Pradhan!

554
00:40:21,951 --> 00:40:23,145
Order tea!

555
00:40:24,253 --> 00:40:27,950
- No!
- What? You don't have tea?

556
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:31,752
Yes! But I won't give
it to goons like you.

557
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,391
What did you say?

558
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:43,404
Can't you hear? I called
you a goon! A goon!

559
00:40:49,712 --> 00:40:56,712
Listening to my threats...
has made him lose his mind!

560
00:41:09,098 --> 00:41:13,967
Hey! If Babban found out
about your new ruse...

561
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:34,247
Sorry!

562
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:38,123
Come on! Leave!

563
00:41:42,898 --> 00:41:44,024
Now we will have fun!

564
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,227
When Babban will receive
the breaking news!

565
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:31,270
How many?

566
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,742
- How many?
- Two.

567
00:42:53,202 --> 00:42:59,004
One... two...

568
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,703
Tambhe!

569
00:43:06,182 --> 00:43:10,175
How much money has the government
spend to nab me?

570
00:43:11,253 --> 00:43:14,154
Don't know for sure!
Must be 100 crores!

571
00:43:19,128 --> 00:43:24,623
This expenditure is incurred... so
that every policeman's wife...

572
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:31,700
doesn't fast for Karvyachaut
but for Babban Singh!

573
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:39,239
And you three people are
tarnishing my name!

574
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:44,377
I made a mistake!

575
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:53,327
It's my mistake! Mine! Not yours!

576
00:43:56,065 --> 00:43:57,862
Low grade people!

577
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,031
Stood against me!

578
00:44:01,003 --> 00:44:04,200
My name!

579
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:09,277
Tarnishing my name! My name!

580
00:44:09,812 --> 00:44:13,179
- What do you say?
- He should be punished!

581
00:44:15,117 --> 00:44:19,019
Correct! Correct! Correct!

582
00:44:20,022 --> 00:44:21,717
Punishment should be given!

583
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:31,727
- How many bullets are in this?
- 6!

584
00:44:32,668 --> 00:44:35,933
Remove 2! 4 bullets for 4 people!

585
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:40,372
No injustice!

586
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:41,701
Sit!

587
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:43,669
Sit!

588
00:44:52,788 --> 00:44:54,050
I have drawn the line!

589
00:44:58,194 --> 00:45:00,822
Now I will spin this!

590
00:45:02,031 --> 00:45:03,794
If the barrel points
at you, you are dead!

591
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:06,996
If at me...

592
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:15,797
I... I...

593
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:18,601
- What?
- I... I...

594
00:46:18,674 --> 00:46:19,732
Did you say something?

595
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:21,334
- I... I...
- What?

596
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,282
Tambhe! He too fooled death!

597
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:39,085
Now?

598
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:07,905
This is... nobody's friend.

599
00:49:10,846 --> 00:49:14,338
If this fires... then you are dead!

600
00:49:48,817 --> 00:49:49,909
Tambhe!

601
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:53,277
After so many years too... they
still don't understand...

602
00:49:53,355 --> 00:49:58,987
that even Babban himself
doesn't trust his words.

603
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:04,424
We have launched
the attack on Babban.

604
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:08,101
Now he must be retaliating
at jet speed!

605
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:14,207
Pradhan! Tell everybody!

606
00:50:14,443 --> 00:50:17,344
If any unknown man is
seen in our area...

607
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,238
Along with weapon,
you should always...

608
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:20,339
be prepared for the attack.

609
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:24,045
I will kill both of them right away!

610
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,785
Along with them 20-25
more Kaliganj people...

611
00:50:27,723 --> 00:50:31,955
I will cause such violence that
forget going against Babban...

612
00:50:32,027 --> 00:50:33,453
people will be scared
to even take his name!

613
00:50:35,764 --> 00:50:36,822
What do you think?

614
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:43,936
You will go there... and Thakur
along with both of them...

615
00:50:44,006 --> 00:50:45,234
will stand ready for your bullet?

616
00:50:46,775 --> 00:50:47,867
And he will say come on and shoot!

617
00:50:55,384 --> 00:51:00,412
If you don't calm down...
you harm your own self.

618
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:07,260
I won't make the same mistake
that America did with Iraq.

619
00:51:09,264 --> 00:51:10,322
It's their area.

620
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:14,302
If you went there without
any preparation...

621
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:32,919
When is Diwali?

622
00:52:09,691 --> 00:52:10,749
Careful sister.

623
00:52:11,693 --> 00:52:13,388
Who are you calling sister?

624
00:52:14,129 --> 00:52:16,654
Ghungroo, you.

625
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:19,127
- What are you wearing?
- Why?

626
00:52:19,768 --> 00:52:21,133
Should you have worn it?

627
00:52:22,037 --> 00:52:24,870
No, no you are such
a good looking girl...

628
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,100
you should wear clothes like these.

629
00:52:26,808 --> 00:52:27,866
Like you.

630
00:52:27,943 --> 00:52:30,844
- Don't joke with me.
- Okay.

631
00:52:31,146 --> 00:52:32,636
First you joke with me then you lie.

632
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:33,739
Hey sparkler!

633
00:52:35,284 --> 00:52:37,343
You are calling me sparkler.

634
00:52:37,653 --> 00:52:39,382
I called a sparkler, sparkler.

635
00:52:40,756 --> 00:52:42,348
Ghungroo, why do you
always think that...

636
00:52:42,658 --> 00:52:47,686
If you dare look at me again
then I will blind you!

637
00:52:47,896 --> 00:52:52,128
And I will put this sparkler
down your throat!

638
00:52:52,301 --> 00:52:53,359
Did you understand?

639
00:52:53,435 --> 00:52:54,959
Listen! I will pour kerosene on you...

640
00:52:55,037 --> 00:52:56,971
- and throw a cigarette on you!
- Enough

641
00:52:57,205 --> 00:53:01,005
No listen, I will sell your
burnt body in the scrap.

642
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:02,906
You won't find any buyer.

643
00:53:03,011 --> 00:53:05,206
You won't be capable to kick
start too, understood!

644
00:53:06,381 --> 00:53:08,076
You have such a criminal thinking.

645
00:53:10,686 --> 00:53:11,744
You are just too much!

646
00:53:33,809 --> 00:53:35,140
I respect you a lot.

647
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:42,073
Why?

648
00:53:42,384 --> 00:53:49,051
So much happened, but still
you think about the people...

649
00:53:49,658 --> 00:53:50,886
run the clinic, take care of them.

650
00:53:51,793 --> 00:53:52,951
You do understand what I am saying?

651
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:54,987
What did you used to do earlier?

652
00:54:00,669 --> 00:54:02,694
I get up in the morning
and sleep in the night...

653
00:54:04,272 --> 00:54:08,800
and the next day, the same thing.

654
00:54:12,314 --> 00:54:19,314
Actually... the meaningless
life that I am living...

655
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,624
I can understand it,
after seeing you.

656
00:54:24,192 --> 00:54:25,318
After seeing Mr. Narsimha.

657
00:54:27,195 --> 00:54:30,096
Even I have learnt a lot
of things from him.

658
00:54:31,299 --> 00:54:35,099
You won't believe, before
losing his job...

659
00:54:38,006 --> 00:54:40,736
he used to live very happily.

660
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,751
He lost his job because of his
fingers, isn't it? - Yes.

661
00:54:52,654 --> 00:54:55,214
- How did it happen?
- It was an accident.

662
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:56,715
What happened?

663
00:54:56,825 --> 00:55:00,158
I don't know, whenever I
ask him he never says.

664
00:55:03,065 --> 00:55:06,000
Maybe he doesn't like to
think about the accident.

665
00:55:07,169 --> 00:55:10,229
Anyway what is the use
thinking about it?

666
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,778
Naqvi sir! Naqvi sir!

667
00:56:12,267 --> 00:56:13,393
Bhai, we have found one.

668
00:56:16,771 --> 00:56:17,897
One of them has been found.

669
00:56:20,275 --> 00:56:23,039
But... that other one
is still missing.

670
00:56:24,246 --> 00:56:25,304
There is still some risk.

671
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:28,111
You don't understand feelings.

672
00:56:30,085 --> 00:56:31,143
Like magnet!

673
00:56:32,854 --> 00:56:37,621
Like magnet, he will draw
the other one out!

674
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:03,208
Hello Narsu.

675
00:57:05,086 --> 00:57:06,212
Hello, hello, hello.

676
00:57:09,324 --> 00:57:11,383
You have grown old, old.

677
00:57:26,608 --> 00:57:28,940
Is everything fine, isn't it?

678
00:57:30,612 --> 00:57:31,636
Have courage, have courage.

679
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,353
So this is one of Narsu's.

680
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,224
Where is the second?

681
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:56,896
Second!

682
00:57:59,641 --> 00:58:01,006
Second!

683
00:58:03,144 --> 00:58:05,237
Come out or I will blow first's head!

684
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:09,340
- I will count three, only three!
- Wait!

685
00:58:12,954 --> 00:58:14,012
I am coming!

686
00:58:17,926 --> 00:58:19,325
There he comes.

687
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:21,987
Come on.

688
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:26,124
Come.

689
00:58:26,968 --> 00:58:28,026
Magnet.

690
00:58:31,606 --> 00:58:33,130
What did I ask you for?

691
00:58:35,176 --> 00:58:38,634
This land at the price of death.

692
00:58:39,014 --> 00:58:40,038
That's not a crime!

693
00:58:41,216 --> 00:58:42,274
And so what if it is a crime.

694
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:48,248
This is true, that's a lie,
that's injustice.

695
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:50,783
All of it is a lie.

696
00:58:52,294 --> 00:58:53,352
All of it is a lie.

697
00:58:57,699 --> 00:58:58,757
Babban is the only reality.

698
00:59:00,268 --> 00:59:01,326
Only Babban.

699
00:59:01,403 --> 00:59:02,802
I am telling you one thing,
listen carefully.

700
00:59:05,807 --> 00:59:07,065
Even Babban himself cannot save you...

701
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:07,999
from Babban's wrath.

702
00:59:11,279 --> 00:59:12,337
What do you say?

703
00:59:13,882 --> 00:59:14,940
Both of them...

704
00:59:20,955 --> 00:59:24,891
Babban sir, I swear on you...

705
00:59:24,993 --> 00:59:28,053
I didn't even know that
you are Babban sir.

706
00:59:30,332 --> 00:59:33,824
- I was influenced by this Narsimha.
- Heero.

707
00:59:34,202 --> 00:59:35,931
Please forgive us.

708
00:59:36,304 --> 00:59:40,138
We didn't know that he was your man.

709
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:45,908
I am... prepared to fall at your
feet and... beg for mercy.

710
00:59:47,882 --> 00:59:50,214
We don't have any personal enmities.

711
00:59:51,686 --> 00:59:52,744
Please forgive me.

712
00:59:59,694 --> 01:00:02,162
If you say, we will join your gang...

713
01:00:02,964 --> 01:00:05,023
it is fine even if you give 4 lakh.

714
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:40,725
Sir.

715
01:01:41,663 --> 01:01:42,823
Seems like he ran away.

716
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:46,791
He ran away.

717
01:01:48,436 --> 01:01:49,869
Atleast he ran away.

718
01:01:50,872 --> 01:01:55,673
After that day, we met today
for the first time.

719
01:01:56,311 --> 01:01:57,403
Which day?

720
01:01:57,812 --> 01:01:59,803
Since the day I joined
the police force...

721
01:02:00,715 --> 01:02:04,674
I had only one motive,
to catch Babban.

722
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:09,117
The police never saw a
gangster like Babban.

723
01:02:10,158 --> 01:02:14,686
There are some gangsters that
operate from other countries...

724
01:02:15,296 --> 01:02:17,355
and some from within the jail.

725
01:02:18,766 --> 01:02:23,226
Babban used to stay in this
city and operate openly.

726
01:02:24,272 --> 01:02:27,241
I found out that he had
only one weakness.

727
01:02:29,043 --> 01:02:30,067
Younger brother Amber.

728
01:02:38,753 --> 01:02:39,811
Greetings.

729
01:02:39,888 --> 01:02:42,948
I bought a sari and a gold chain.

730
01:03:06,814 --> 01:03:07,872
You have become thin.

731
01:03:08,416 --> 01:03:11,044
I have brought this for Yash.

732
01:03:13,288 --> 01:03:14,346
And this too.

733
01:03:19,394 --> 01:03:22,192
Police force.

734
01:03:23,698 --> 01:03:26,667
Go, please.

735
01:03:27,769 --> 01:03:28,827
Go from here.

736
01:03:30,305 --> 01:03:31,363
Why did you come after all?

737
01:03:40,949 --> 01:03:46,216
You ask me more questions
then I love you.

738
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:48,713
Because I am tired of giving
answers to people!

739
01:03:50,258 --> 01:03:52,385
The police come every 15
days and interrogate me.

740
01:03:52,994 --> 01:03:54,928
The channel people ask me all
sorts of question about you!

741
01:03:56,297 --> 01:03:57,821
I am tired of it all, I am tired.

742
01:03:58,866 --> 01:04:00,959
Look, if you want to give something...

743
01:04:01,836 --> 01:04:02,894
then give me a promise!

744
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:05,738
That after today we will
never meet, that's all.

745
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:16,075
You have grown up.

746
01:04:17,885 --> 01:04:20,115
You have grown up, you
say such big things.

747
01:04:22,624 --> 01:04:23,921
You talk sense.

748
01:04:51,285 --> 01:04:52,343
Stop Babban!

749
01:04:54,055 --> 01:04:55,784
Or else I will kill your brother.

750
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:06,725
Go.

751
01:05:28,756 --> 01:05:32,021
Keeping in mind all the
evidences and testimony...

752
01:05:32,093 --> 01:05:34,721
the court has come
to the conclusion...

753
01:05:35,163 --> 01:05:38,098
that the accused Babban
has been proven guilty...

754
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:39,360
for kidnapping and murder.

755
01:05:39,934 --> 01:05:45,031
And so the court finds the
accused Babban guilty...

756
01:05:45,106 --> 01:05:48,166
and life imprisonment under IPC 302.

757
01:06:07,662 --> 01:06:08,720
I will not forget it.

758
01:06:13,034 --> 01:06:16,333
The time you are going
to spend in jail...

759
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,230
you will forget everything.

760
01:06:33,788 --> 01:06:34,846
Take him away.

761
01:06:52,907 --> 01:06:54,374
Okay! Okay! Thank you!

762
01:06:54,942 --> 01:06:56,136
Father! Father!

763
01:06:56,277 --> 01:06:58,268
- Babban has received life sentence!
- Oh!

764
01:06:58,346 --> 01:06:59,745
- Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!
- Listen...

765
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:02,682
Father, you don't know how much
people are praising brother!

766
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:04,008
Sister-in-law!

767
01:07:04,652 --> 01:07:05,710
Sister-in-law, listen!

768
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:09,353
Your dear husband has got
Babban life sentence!

769
01:07:09,724 --> 01:07:10,782
Babban who?

770
01:07:10,858 --> 01:07:12,052
- Babban who?
- Yes!

771
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:16,126
Had he been here... he would
have committed suicide!

772
01:07:16,664 --> 01:07:18,154
Forget about Babban, Subbu!

773
01:07:18,232 --> 01:07:21,326
Listen! Did you bring mixed spices
paste that I told you to bring?

774
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:23,996
What is this? Babban! Nonsense!
Waste of time!

775
01:07:27,275 --> 01:07:29,607
Tell your department...
to give a medal too!

776
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:32,135
After all you have done
such a great deed!

777
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:34,308
I will give it to you as soon
as I finish work! - Okay!

778
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,911
Why have you come so late?

779
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:40,345
Kavita... you know!

780
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:43,146
But I had told you to come
early at least today!

781
01:07:43,724 --> 01:07:45,123
Again the same thing!

782
01:07:45,326 --> 01:07:46,850
You don't interfere, Subbu!

783
01:07:47,295 --> 01:07:49,820
Not Babban, but you have got
life imprisonment, brother!

784
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:52,359
What is there to laugh so much?

785
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,058
Hey!

786
01:07:54,302 --> 01:07:55,963
You think our marriage
is life imprisonment?

787
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:00,732
Subbu! Where are you going
after starting the quarrel!

788
01:08:00,808 --> 01:08:02,173
Brother, quarrel precedes peace!

789
01:08:03,277 --> 01:08:04,335
Narsimha!

790
01:08:07,248 --> 01:08:09,216
What about Devi clinic's assistant?

791
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:10,708
I have made the arrangement.

792
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:12,710
Where is Devi?

793
01:08:28,836 --> 01:08:31,771
"The colours clung to the body."

794
01:08:32,106 --> 01:08:34,939
"Hug me like this."

795
01:08:35,276 --> 01:08:36,641
"Why are you laughing?."

796
01:08:36,944 --> 01:08:38,138
"I am in merriment."

797
01:08:38,646 --> 01:08:41,911
"I am crazy. I am not bad."

798
01:08:42,116 --> 01:08:43,811
"Let me go."

799
01:08:43,985 --> 01:08:45,213
"Don't talk like this."

800
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,951
"It's just an excuse."

801
01:08:47,021 --> 01:08:48,682
"Even you know that."

802
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,221
"Your eyes are bad."

803
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:51,922
"Even I know that."

804
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:54,719
"Leave me alone."

805
01:08:56,764 --> 01:08:58,095
"It's Holi."

806
01:08:58,165 --> 01:08:59,757
"The language of colours."

807
01:08:59,967 --> 01:09:02,299
"Hear it."

808
01:09:03,237 --> 01:09:04,761
"It's Holi."

809
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:06,363
"Attack of colours."

810
01:09:06,774 --> 01:09:09,743
"Nobody can escape."

811
01:09:09,777 --> 01:09:12,940
"The colours clung to the body."

812
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:16,308
"Hug me like this."

813
01:09:16,651 --> 01:09:17,743
"Why are you laughing?."

814
01:09:17,818 --> 01:09:19,342
"I am in merriment."

815
01:09:19,787 --> 01:09:23,086
"I am crazy. I am not bad."

816
01:09:25,059 --> 01:09:26,390
"You don't know me."

817
01:09:26,794 --> 01:09:28,091
"I am multi-hued."

818
01:09:28,262 --> 01:09:31,823
"Touch me and you will be
smeared with colours."

819
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:33,662
"Look at me covertly."

820
01:09:33,734 --> 01:09:34,792
"Try to escape."

821
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:37,861
"Otherwise you will regret it."

822
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:39,167
"Leave! Leave! Leave!"

823
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,898
"Leave! Leave! Leave!"

824
01:09:41,108 --> 01:09:42,336
" Leave! Leave! Leave!"

825
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:44,207
"Leave! Leave! Leave!"

826
01:09:44,278 --> 01:09:46,303
"What will you do?."

827
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:47,870
"I am after you."

828
01:09:48,115 --> 01:09:49,343
"Even I am not any less."

829
01:09:49,417 --> 01:09:51,180
"I won't budge."

830
01:09:51,352 --> 01:09:52,876
"Tell me."

831
01:09:53,087 --> 01:09:54,384
"How can I let go of you?."

832
01:09:54,455 --> 01:09:57,856
"It's Holi."

833
01:09:57,925 --> 01:10:00,758
"The colours clung to the body."

834
01:10:01,095 --> 01:10:04,223
"Hug me like this."

835
01:10:04,298 --> 01:10:05,856
"Why are you laughing?."

836
01:10:05,933 --> 01:10:07,298
"I am in merriment."

837
01:10:07,702 --> 01:10:10,865
"I am crazy. I am not bad."

838
01:10:28,656 --> 01:10:30,783
"Don't follow me."

839
01:10:30,858 --> 01:10:32,291
"Listen, loafer."

840
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,857
"What do you think of me?."

841
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:36,988
"Stop!"

842
01:10:37,064 --> 01:10:39,897
"Don't come after me!"

843
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:41,958
"Leave otherwise you will regret it."

844
01:10:42,036 --> 01:10:45,369
"Carefully! Carefully! Leave! Leave!"

845
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:46,736
"Leave! Leave! Leave!"

846
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:48,672
"Carefully! Carefully!"

847
01:10:48,909 --> 01:10:50,809
"What will you do?."

848
01:10:50,911 --> 01:10:52,105
"I am after you."

849
01:10:52,313 --> 01:10:53,712
"Even I am not any less."

850
01:10:53,781 --> 01:10:55,180
"I won't budge."

851
01:10:55,683 --> 01:10:57,173
"Tell me."

852
01:10:57,251 --> 01:10:58,741
"How can I let go of you?."

853
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:01,151
"It's Holi."

854
01:11:03,691 --> 01:11:04,919
"You have come."

855
01:11:05,126 --> 01:11:06,320
"Why are you acting smugly?."

856
01:11:06,827 --> 01:11:10,058
"We are carillon. You are bells."

857
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:11,359
"What saunter!"

858
01:11:11,432 --> 01:11:13,059
"Mind-blowing!"

859
01:11:13,267 --> 01:11:16,703
"Why won't anybody stare at you?."

860
01:11:16,904 --> 01:11:18,201
"Let me see how you stare!"

861
01:11:18,639 --> 01:11:19,901
"Don't talk like this."

862
01:11:20,207 --> 01:11:21,640
"It's just an excuse."

863
01:11:21,809 --> 01:11:23,276
"Even you know that."

864
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:24,844
"Your eyes are bad."

865
01:11:24,879 --> 01:11:26,642
"Even I know that."

866
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:29,907
"Leave me alone."

867
01:11:29,984 --> 01:11:31,315
"It's Holi."

868
01:11:31,385 --> 01:11:32,875
"The language of colours."

869
01:11:33,087 --> 01:11:35,385
"Hear it."

870
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:37,880
"It's Holi."

871
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:39,653
"Attack of colours."

872
01:11:39,827 --> 01:11:42,955
"Nobody can escape."

873
01:12:00,881 --> 01:12:01,973
- Hello!
- Why don't you answer me?

874
01:12:02,349 --> 01:12:04,374
Why are you going for work today too?

875
01:12:04,685 --> 01:12:07,017
Brother! Please drop us at clinic.

876
01:12:07,088 --> 01:12:08,616
Sister-in-law... again
you have... - Sit quickly!

877
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:09,786
Okay! All right! Thank you!

878
01:12:09,824 --> 01:12:11,291
Does anybody go for work on Holi?

879
01:12:12,693 --> 01:12:13,751
- Go, go! Brother, go!
- Subbu!

880
01:13:25,866 --> 01:13:26,924
What happened?

881
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:32,797
What happened?

882
01:14:34,235 --> 01:14:37,068
They came and...

883
01:14:38,172 --> 01:14:39,230
Kavita!

884
01:14:42,676 --> 01:14:43,768
Where is Kavita?

885
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:33,992
"This is a fire."

886
01:15:34,762 --> 01:15:37,890
"This is a fire."

887
01:15:41,702 --> 01:15:48,039
"...that never stops, that
is never quenched."

888
01:15:48,876 --> 01:15:52,277
"This is a fire."

889
01:15:53,247 --> 01:15:59,811
"Whoever touched it has burnt.
And somewhere only smoke is left."

890
01:16:00,154 --> 01:16:05,023
"How can you breathe in this fire?."

891
01:16:21,608 --> 01:16:26,307
"This is a fire."

892
01:16:27,915 --> 01:16:33,683
"What makes it so dangerous?."

893
01:16:34,755 --> 01:16:38,191
"Whoever touches it is burnt."

894
01:17:20,334 --> 01:17:22,131
Untie me! Untie me!

895
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:28,264
- Untie me!
- Scoundrel!

896
01:17:28,342 --> 01:17:31,834
Untie me! Untie me!

897
01:17:31,912 --> 01:17:33,812
Scream! Scream more!

898
01:17:41,622 --> 01:17:42,850
How is your family?

899
01:17:45,759 --> 01:17:46,817
Don't be afraid!

900
01:17:47,861 --> 01:17:50,796
I won't kill you! I won't kill you!

901
01:17:50,898 --> 01:17:53,162
If I killed you then my
life will lose its fun!

902
01:17:57,304 --> 01:18:00,000
This... finger.

903
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,733
You kill with this!

904
01:18:06,246 --> 01:18:10,148
You like to kill! Point the
gun... press the trigger!

905
01:18:10,984 --> 01:18:12,110
And the person is dead!

906
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,712
The counting begins! Counting!
You note it down!

907
01:18:18,025 --> 01:18:19,652
You have killed countless people!

908
01:18:27,734 --> 01:18:29,998
When I was a kid... I
used to play a lot!

909
01:18:30,671 --> 01:18:32,138
I used to play with my brother!

910
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,298
Do you know what happened one day?

911
01:18:34,374 --> 01:18:38,308
A boy came and slapped
my brother jokingly!

912
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:40,644
My brother's tooth broke.

913
01:18:41,915 --> 01:18:46,818
I... chopped off his this part!

914
01:18:48,689 --> 01:18:54,218
For my brother... I chopped
off his jaws!

915
01:18:56,797 --> 01:18:57,923
And you killed my brother!

916
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:05,300
- Hey! Bring the chair!
- Yes!

917
01:19:08,275 --> 01:19:10,869
Not here! There! More!

918
01:19:14,047 --> 01:19:16,174
My brother loved spinning top!

919
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,081
Do you understand it? Like this...

920
01:19:18,151 --> 01:19:19,914
with a nail at the bottom.

921
01:19:20,053 --> 01:19:22,715
Spin the thread and throw it!

922
01:19:23,123 --> 01:19:24,954
It spins! Spins! Spins!

923
01:19:25,926 --> 01:19:28,724
If you took it in your hand,
it spins in your hand!

924
01:19:29,763 --> 01:19:30,821
It tickles you!

925
01:19:31,265 --> 01:19:32,960
It spins! Spins!

926
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,158
Spins!

927
01:19:36,036 --> 01:19:37,970
Once a boy stole it from my brother!

928
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:42,266
Do you know what I did?

929
01:19:45,712 --> 01:19:48,078
I nailed the top's nail in his skull!

930
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:51,783
In his skull!

931
01:19:53,053 --> 01:19:54,315
And you killed my brother!

932
01:19:55,088 --> 01:19:58,148
We both brothers used to fly kite!

933
01:19:59,393 --> 01:20:00,860
On the terrace! Terrace!

934
01:20:01,295 --> 01:20:02,387
Kite!

935
01:20:02,796 --> 01:20:04,423
We both loved flying kites!

936
01:20:06,233 --> 01:20:08,326
We used to fly it. Somebody
else used to fly it!

937
01:20:08,802 --> 01:20:11,930
Once a boy tore my brother's kite!

938
01:20:12,072 --> 01:20:13,130
Do you know what I did?

939
01:20:13,407 --> 01:20:15,238
I threw him from the
top of the building!

940
01:20:20,681 --> 01:20:22,080
You shouldn't have killed my brother!

941
01:20:26,353 --> 01:20:29,288
This... you kill others with
these fingers, don't you?

942
01:20:30,724 --> 01:20:32,248
You pull the trigger
and the man dies!

943
01:20:54,881 --> 01:20:58,180
- He was a kid!
- Untie me!

944
01:20:58,251 --> 01:21:03,154
Small... small... a small kid.

945
01:21:06,393 --> 01:21:09,885
Not like you and me! A small
kid! He was a kid!

946
01:21:15,969 --> 01:21:17,732
He considered me as his father!

947
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:23,335
More than strangers, he hated me!

948
01:21:26,246 --> 01:21:29,079
He hated me! And you
killed my brother!

949
01:23:15,118 --> 01:23:16,210
Tambhe!

950
01:23:21,558 --> 01:23:25,517
If Dhanya's ghost comes and asks me...

951
01:23:25,595 --> 01:23:29,031
you too ran away from there!

952
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,228
What will I tell him?

953
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:35,228
What has happened, it has happened.

954
01:23:35,305 --> 01:23:36,263
Hey!

955
01:23:43,013 --> 01:23:46,505
What happened... that never happened!

956
01:23:48,585 --> 01:23:49,984
What never happened,
it will happen now!

957
01:24:06,202 --> 01:24:13,040
Celebrate! Celebrate!
Celebrate the victory!

958
01:24:14,678 --> 01:24:15,770
For the moment...

959
01:24:21,651 --> 01:24:25,849
They began the game. I will end it.

960
01:24:26,022 --> 01:24:27,114
Which game?

961
01:24:56,519 --> 01:24:58,953
Why are you working
so slowly! Hurry up!

962
01:24:59,589 --> 01:25:01,614
Calm down, Ghungroo!

963
01:25:03,193 --> 01:25:04,785
How come you know my name?

964
01:25:07,097 --> 01:25:09,156
I even know your mother's name!

965
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:13,067
- Gangu's mummy!
- Who are you?

966
01:25:14,604 --> 01:25:18,040
Ddaruwala! Ddaruwala with double D!

967
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:19,800
I am a famous astrologer!

968
01:25:20,944 --> 01:25:23,742
Famous! I am seeing you in Kaliganj
for the first time!

969
01:25:23,847 --> 01:25:26,008
I have come to Kaliganj
for the first time!

970
01:25:26,049 --> 01:25:28,108
So you are bound to see me
here for the first time!

971
01:25:28,151 --> 01:25:29,209
So how come you are famous?

972
01:25:29,552 --> 01:25:31,816
In my village! Safedganj!

973
01:25:31,921 --> 01:25:33,718
How do you know my and
my mother's name?

974
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:35,517
If an astrologer can't
tell you your name...

975
01:25:35,592 --> 01:25:37,059
then he is not an astrologer!

976
01:25:39,629 --> 01:25:40,721
Laila!

977
01:25:42,232 --> 01:25:45,998
You have named the auto
Laila as per numerology!

978
01:25:46,069 --> 01:25:47,161
Am I right?

979
01:25:47,737 --> 01:25:51,901
This is too much! I think
you are a top astrologer!

980
01:25:52,008 --> 01:25:55,967
What top, what bottom!
I can only say a bit...

981
01:26:00,617 --> 01:26:04,485
I can say that your henna, turmeric
ceremony and engagement...

982
01:26:04,521 --> 01:26:06,989
nothing will happen!

983
01:26:07,691 --> 01:26:09,852
- Then?
- Directly marriage!

984
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,618
With whom?

985
01:26:13,596 --> 01:26:18,659
As per numerology, there
is an O in your name.

986
01:26:19,736 --> 01:26:24,196
So your groom's name
should have two Es!

987
01:26:26,142 --> 01:26:27,200
Kaleem?

988
01:26:29,012 --> 01:26:34,040
If you married Kaleem... then you
will collide with Laila and die!

989
01:26:34,117 --> 01:26:35,141
Then who?

990
01:26:35,618 --> 01:26:39,645
There is somebody! Smart!
Handsome! Hero like!

991
01:26:40,657 --> 01:26:42,887
- Who?
- He even has a gun!

992
01:26:43,793 --> 01:26:45,761
- That Heero!
- Yes!

993
01:26:45,862 --> 01:26:47,557
That goon, ruffian, loafer!

994
01:26:48,531 --> 01:26:49,998
No! No! No!

995
01:26:51,067 --> 01:26:53,592
Don't judge the book by its
cover! He is your lover!

996
01:26:55,171 --> 01:26:57,799
Why? You don't like him?

997
01:26:58,541 --> 01:26:59,633
That is not so!

998
01:26:59,743 --> 01:27:02,109
He is a nice guy! He
speaks good English!

999
01:27:02,178 --> 01:27:04,669
He doesn't speak English! He
only knows how to say yes!

1000
01:27:04,814 --> 01:27:06,179
So you too say yes!

1001
01:27:08,785 --> 01:27:09,809
Heero, you are right!

1002
01:27:09,919 --> 01:27:11,580
That is what I am saying!

1003
01:27:14,124 --> 01:27:15,819
- What did you say?
- You are right!

1004
01:27:16,559 --> 01:27:18,857
No! Before that!

1005
01:27:19,095 --> 01:27:21,996
You are right! Double E! Heero!

1006
01:27:22,065 --> 01:27:23,123
You have become mum now!

1007
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:25,963
If you are smart, then Ghungroo
is smarter than you!

1008
01:27:26,102 --> 01:27:27,569
What do you think of yourself?

1009
01:27:27,737 --> 01:27:32,697
If I lost my temper... then
Laila will be over you!

1010
01:27:32,842 --> 01:27:35,037
I will squash you! You fool!

1011
01:27:35,945 --> 01:27:37,071
I am giving you last warning!

1012
01:27:39,749 --> 01:27:43,014
Laila! I mean... Ghungroo! Ghungroo!

1013
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:45,817
- Listen to me!
- Leave!

1014
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:48,716
I am sorry!

1015
01:27:49,793 --> 01:27:50,987
I just want to tell you one thing!

1016
01:27:52,996 --> 01:27:54,759
I love you a lot!

1017
01:27:59,169 --> 01:28:00,636
And I can't live without you!

1018
01:28:01,971 --> 01:28:03,063
Heero!

1019
01:28:04,641 --> 01:28:06,768
Mr. Narsimha wants to meet you!

1020
01:28:14,818 --> 01:28:15,910
Do you love me?

1021
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:17,879
Yes!

1022
01:28:25,094 --> 01:28:26,186
Yes!

1023
01:28:29,566 --> 01:28:30,658
I love you!

1024
01:28:33,837 --> 01:28:34,929
Yes!

1025
01:29:01,197 --> 01:29:03,961
I have got information about Babban!

1026
01:30:26,883 --> 01:30:29,681
"Yeah! Yeah!"

1027
01:30:29,919 --> 01:30:31,011
"Come on!"

1028
01:30:31,087 --> 01:30:32,816
"Make way for my man!"

1029
01:30:32,922 --> 01:30:33,980
"That's right!"

1030
01:30:34,757 --> 01:30:35,849
"Check it out!"

1031
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,052
"Come on!"

1032
01:30:38,127 --> 01:30:39,185
"Play beyond."

1033
01:30:40,563 --> 01:30:41,655
"Come on!"

1034
01:31:15,631 --> 01:31:17,622
"Fire in the eyes."

1035
01:31:17,734 --> 01:31:19,759
"Body is smouldering."

1036
01:31:19,902 --> 01:31:23,963
"My sight is the enemy's senses."

1037
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,905
"You are my beloved."

1038
01:31:26,009 --> 01:31:27,977
"My heart is crazy, beloved."

1039
01:31:28,077 --> 01:31:30,011
"You are my beloved."

1040
01:31:30,179 --> 01:31:31,737
"My heart is crazy, beloved."

1041
01:31:31,814 --> 01:31:33,975
"My eyes, my breaths."

1042
01:31:34,017 --> 01:31:36,076
"My lips, my talks."

1043
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:40,556
"Has stolen the heart of everybody
in this jamboree."

1044
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:48,622
"Beloved, beloved."

1045
01:31:49,132 --> 01:31:50,690
"Beloved, beloved."

1046
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,927
"Beloved makes you lose your senses."

1047
01:31:53,136 --> 01:31:54,899
"Beloved, beloved."

1048
01:31:54,971 --> 01:31:57,496
"Beloved steals your solace."

1049
01:31:57,573 --> 01:31:59,006
"You are my beloved."

1050
01:31:59,075 --> 01:32:01,509
"My heart is crazy, beloved."

1051
01:32:01,611 --> 01:32:03,101
"You are my beloved."

1052
01:32:03,179 --> 01:32:05,579
"My heart is crazy, beloved."

1053
01:32:22,732 --> 01:32:25,530
Beloved! Beloved!

1054
01:32:26,803 --> 01:32:30,569
One there! And one here!

1055
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:33,099
Both have killing nature!

1056
01:32:34,077 --> 01:32:36,978
Which death is more fun?

1057
01:32:37,713 --> 01:32:38,907
That is what is to be seen!

1058
01:32:40,016 --> 01:32:43,076
Hey, Tambhe! How will you die?

1059
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:51,651
"Your fear has made
my beauty lethal!"

1060
01:32:51,794 --> 01:32:55,924
"Even death desires to
die with my hands."

1061
01:32:55,998 --> 01:32:57,090
"My heart is craving."

1062
01:32:57,166 --> 01:32:58,224
"My lips are thirsty."

1063
01:32:58,568 --> 01:32:59,899
"Don't torment me, beloved."

1064
01:33:00,002 --> 01:33:01,560
"Listen, beloved."

1065
01:33:01,671 --> 01:33:02,729
"To the words of dream."

1066
01:33:02,839 --> 01:33:04,568
"Heartbeats, beloved."

1067
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,599
"My eyes do the work of the lips."

1068
01:33:08,711 --> 01:33:12,738
"Snatching anxiety,
I provide solace."

1069
01:33:12,915 --> 01:33:14,712
"This intoxication never wanes."

1070
01:33:14,817 --> 01:33:16,648
"I am that kind of intoxication."

1071
01:33:16,752 --> 01:33:19,016
"Love dances after drinking it."

1072
01:33:19,088 --> 01:33:20,180
"I am that merriment."

1073
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:22,588
"Companion, beloved."

1074
01:33:22,725 --> 01:33:24,750
"Don't be stubborn, beloved."

1075
01:33:24,927 --> 01:33:26,792
"Just a glimpse, beloved."

1076
01:33:26,963 --> 01:33:29,591
"Over here, beloved."

1077
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:31,599
"The dusks of my tresses."

1078
01:33:31,734 --> 01:33:33,634
"The twilight of my dreams."

1079
01:33:33,769 --> 01:33:37,671
"Has stolen the heart of everybody
in this jamboree."

1080
01:33:52,088 --> 01:33:54,886
"Beloved, beloved."

1081
01:33:54,991 --> 01:33:56,549
"Beloved, beloved."

1082
01:33:56,692 --> 01:33:58,785
"Beloved makes you
lose your senses."

1083
01:33:59,095 --> 01:34:00,722
"Beloved, beloved."

1084
01:34:00,863 --> 01:34:02,831
"Beloved steals your solace."

1085
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:04,860
"You are my beloved."

1086
01:34:04,934 --> 01:34:07,027
"My heart is crazy, beloved."

1087
01:34:07,136 --> 01:34:09,001
"Beloved, beloved."

1088
01:34:09,071 --> 01:34:11,562
"My heart is crazy, beloved."

1089
01:34:21,951 --> 01:34:23,612
"Beloved, beloved."

1090
01:34:25,988 --> 01:34:27,649
"Beloved, beloved."

1091
01:34:28,224 --> 01:34:29,691
"Beloved, beloved."

1092
01:34:29,825 --> 01:34:32,794
At times even I think.

1093
01:34:33,629 --> 01:34:35,654
Of immersing myself in you.

1094
01:34:36,098 --> 01:34:42,037
What I fear is... what will
happen to you, beloved.

1095
01:34:43,072 --> 01:34:44,937
"Fire in the eyes."

1096
01:34:45,174 --> 01:34:46,937
"Beloved, beloved."

1097
01:34:47,176 --> 01:34:49,076
"Body is smouldering."

1098
01:34:49,212 --> 01:34:51,146
"Beloved, beloved."

1099
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,506
Hey! I am leaving!

1100
01:34:55,885 --> 01:34:56,909
"Beloved."

1101
01:34:56,986 --> 01:34:58,783
- "That's right."
- "Beloved, beloved."

1102
01:34:58,854 --> 01:35:00,651
- "Check it out!"
- "Beloved, beloved."

1103
01:35:00,756 --> 01:35:04,021
- "Come on!"
- "Beloved, beloved."

1104
01:35:04,126 --> 01:35:05,957
"Come on!"

1105
01:35:06,729 --> 01:35:08,094
"Check it out!"

1106
01:35:09,031 --> 01:35:10,123
"Come on!"

1107
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,558
"Check it out!"

1108
01:35:13,636 --> 01:35:14,728
"Come on!"

1109
01:35:19,575 --> 01:35:20,633
What are you looking at?

1110
01:35:21,043 --> 01:35:22,772
Still not content, Mr. Babban!

1111
01:35:28,851 --> 01:35:32,514
There must have been many
girls in your life.

1112
01:35:32,989 --> 01:35:36,584
No! I never gave them the chance!

1113
01:35:37,193 --> 01:35:39,252
- Why?
- Love is a weakness.

1114
01:35:42,198 --> 01:35:45,065
Babban... is strength!

1115
01:35:49,939 --> 01:35:52,134
Delicate! Shall I read it?

1116
01:35:52,942 --> 01:35:54,000
What is written?

1117
01:36:01,617 --> 01:36:02,675
Babban!

1118
01:36:39,021 --> 01:36:40,113
Who is it?

1119
01:36:40,189 --> 01:36:41,588
Bhai! Bhai!

1120
01:36:58,074 --> 01:36:59,132
Get out of here!

1121
01:37:05,514 --> 01:37:07,106
- How did all this happen?
- Raj and Heero!

1122
01:37:07,717 --> 01:37:08,909
I don't know how they reached here!

1123
01:37:09,885 --> 01:37:11,209
They began firing as
soon as they arrived!

1124
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,612
One of them is shot! Maybe...

1125
01:37:13,823 --> 01:37:16,690
Shyam! Shyam!

1126
01:37:23,499 --> 01:37:24,557
He has been shot!

1127
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,565
What... how did this happen?

1128
01:37:33,709 --> 01:37:34,971
They had gone to kill Babban!

1129
01:37:38,647 --> 01:37:39,705
What did you get by sending them?

1130
01:37:40,116 --> 01:37:42,607
What right do you have?
Bring hot water!

1131
01:37:47,456 --> 01:37:48,514
You don't understand anything!

1132
01:37:49,992 --> 01:37:51,050
How much more...

1133
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,720
Ghungroo, why are you standing! Go!

1134
01:37:53,863 --> 01:37:54,921
Go and call Jenny!

1135
01:37:56,866 --> 01:37:58,128
Its okay! Bring hot water!

1136
01:37:58,534 --> 01:37:59,592
Bring hot water! Medicine!

1137
01:38:03,873 --> 01:38:05,935
If you had got shot in your chest
then what would you have done?

1138
01:38:06,008 --> 01:38:07,066
You survived!

1139
01:38:09,011 --> 01:38:10,069
It's a minor thing!

1140
01:38:25,828 --> 01:38:31,630
Today seeing your blood...
I couldn't control myself.

1141
01:38:35,571 --> 01:38:38,096
After Subhash's death, I...

1142
01:38:40,509 --> 01:38:41,567
Subhash?

1143
01:38:42,578 --> 01:38:46,070
My husband! Fighting memories...

1144
01:38:48,050 --> 01:38:49,745
I was trying to live.

1145
01:38:50,653 --> 01:38:53,178
But today... seeing all this...

1146
01:38:56,225 --> 01:38:57,453
all the memories...

1147
01:38:58,994 --> 01:39:04,125
each thing I remembered it again.

1148
01:39:09,071 --> 01:39:10,732
I can't believe it!

1149
01:39:13,876 --> 01:39:19,508
That I spoke to him like this.

1150
01:39:22,685 --> 01:39:27,179
Knowing... that he has endured a lot.

1151
01:42:06,882 --> 01:42:12,718
Why does apple always fall down?

1152
01:42:13,055 --> 01:42:14,647
It's because of gravitation.

1153
01:42:15,057 --> 01:42:16,922
- What?
- Gravitation.

1154
01:42:17,726 --> 01:42:22,459
So how did it go up from below?

1155
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:36,869
This is what has always happened!

1156
01:42:37,479 --> 01:42:41,472
That I have...

1157
01:42:41,517 --> 01:42:44,884
attacked others!

1158
01:42:46,822 --> 01:42:50,485
But today for the first time...
for the first time...

1159
01:42:50,559 --> 01:42:54,620
somebody... attacked me.

1160
01:42:58,167 --> 01:42:59,498
How did this information leaked?

1161
01:43:01,036 --> 01:43:04,563
I will tell you! Your
uncle is the informer!

1162
01:43:08,844 --> 01:43:10,903
No! Maternal uncle!

1163
01:43:18,754 --> 01:43:19,846
Tambhe!

1164
01:43:20,255 --> 01:43:23,850
This blood tie... is really bad!

1165
01:43:23,992 --> 01:43:25,050
It's really bad!

1166
01:43:25,127 --> 01:43:27,118
I didn't do it deliberately! In
the intoxication of drinks...

1167
01:43:27,196 --> 01:43:28,527
- It's really bad!
- I was...

1168
01:43:37,673 --> 01:43:41,200
Cat and mouse game... is
really entertaining!

1169
01:43:42,077 --> 01:43:43,874
Cat can't enter the hole.

1170
01:43:44,012 --> 01:43:48,608
The mouse can't stay in the hole.
So...

1171
01:43:55,491 --> 01:44:01,020
So Kaliganj's one mouse... will
surely come out of the hole.

1172
01:44:03,031 --> 01:44:04,089
Just wait!

1173
01:44:09,505 --> 01:44:10,563
Wait!

1174
01:44:11,507 --> 01:44:12,906
- Raj!
- What?

1175
01:44:13,509 --> 01:44:14,567
Ghungroo!

1176
01:44:14,643 --> 01:44:16,975
- Ghungroo?
- Ghungroo!

1177
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:21,546
Yes! I have fallen in
love with Ghungroo!

1178
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:23,615
What about Nasik's Kajri?

1179
01:44:24,153 --> 01:44:26,121
You have proposed to her too!

1180
01:44:26,588 --> 01:44:28,988
I was not serious about her!

1181
01:44:30,125 --> 01:44:31,524
But I am serious about Ghungroo!

1182
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:33,721
Now I don't want to
do this small job!

1183
01:44:34,997 --> 01:44:37,056
I just want to marry Ghungroo!

1184
01:44:41,069 --> 01:44:47,008
Heero... that Devi...

1185
01:44:48,477 --> 01:44:49,535
What happened to her?

1186
01:44:49,611 --> 01:44:53,479
Nothing happened to her! In fact me...

1187
01:44:53,615 --> 01:44:54,673
What happened to you?

1188
01:44:55,717 --> 01:45:02,020
Let me talk! I like her a lot!

1189
01:45:02,758 --> 01:45:08,025
And you are the only person
who can understand me.

1190
01:45:08,697 --> 01:45:12,758
I can pour out my soul
to you. I love Devi.

1191
01:45:16,104 --> 01:45:17,162
Raj...

1192
01:45:22,177 --> 01:45:24,771
you do what you think is right.

1193
01:45:25,948 --> 01:45:29,748
Don't ask anybody! Just do it!

1194
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:32,978
Yes!

1195
01:45:33,055 --> 01:45:34,522
I wanted to talk to you!

1196
01:45:34,656 --> 01:45:35,714
Come! Sit!

1197
01:45:35,991 --> 01:45:40,985
I... you see... my friend Heero...

1198
01:45:42,798 --> 01:45:44,129
he loves Ghungroo!

1199
01:45:45,534 --> 01:45:49,470
And he wants me to go
and meet Gangu mummy...

1200
01:45:49,538 --> 01:45:52,803
and talk about his alliance.

1201
01:45:54,076 --> 01:45:56,476
I have heard so much
about Gangu mummy...

1202
01:45:56,545 --> 01:45:58,672
that I am scared of her.

1203
01:46:00,015 --> 01:46:04,884
But if you helped me... then
Heero's work will be done.

1204
01:46:06,688 --> 01:46:12,092
And... Heero really loves Ghungroo!

1205
01:46:15,697 --> 01:46:16,755
I swear on you.

1206
01:46:23,705 --> 01:46:24,763
I swear on myself.

1207
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:35,808
How is your arm now?

1208
01:46:36,018 --> 01:46:38,145
If Devi is saying then
the guy must be good.

1209
01:46:39,154 --> 01:46:40,781
I forgot! What will you have?

1210
01:46:41,056 --> 01:46:42,717
No, no! We won't take dowry!

1211
01:46:44,126 --> 01:46:45,923
She is asking for tea or coffee.

1212
01:46:46,662 --> 01:46:50,655
Oh! No, no! I am fine!

1213
01:46:50,999 --> 01:46:52,523
What is Heero's educational
qualification?

1214
01:46:56,538 --> 01:46:57,937
He is educated, isn't he?

1215
01:46:58,073 --> 01:47:01,008
- Yes! It will be done!
- Done?

1216
01:47:01,677 --> 01:47:03,542
I mean it's done!

1217
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:04,805
How much is Heero's earning?

1218
01:47:04,947 --> 01:47:06,209
How much does Heero earn?

1219
01:47:07,516 --> 01:47:09,177
Same as mine.

1220
01:47:09,685 --> 01:47:11,676
- How much is yours?
- Same as Heero's.

1221
01:47:12,087 --> 01:47:14,214
Okay! So you have seen Ghungroo,
haven't you?

1222
01:47:14,489 --> 01:47:16,684
She rides the auto! She
looks after the house!

1223
01:47:17,492 --> 01:47:18,618
But what does this Heero do?

1224
01:47:18,894 --> 01:47:20,885
Heero! Heero uses 'Ghoda' (Means
gun as well as horse)!

1225
01:47:23,632 --> 01:47:24,690
- Gun?
- He uses gun?

1226
01:47:25,701 --> 01:47:30,035
Not that one! Horse! He rides horses!

1227
01:47:30,238 --> 01:47:32,900
I see! You mean to say horse racing!

1228
01:47:32,975 --> 01:47:37,105
No, no, papa! Not horse
racing! Running race!

1229
01:47:38,847 --> 01:47:42,510
No! I mean... Raj means to say...

1230
01:47:42,551 --> 01:47:45,850
that Heero runs like a horse!

1231
01:47:45,921 --> 01:47:47,047
- Am I right?
- Yes!

1232
01:47:47,522 --> 01:47:48,580
- Exactly!
- Yes!

1233
01:47:48,657 --> 01:47:50,852
Heero... is faster than the horse!

1234
01:47:51,059 --> 01:47:52,458
I see! I see! I see!

1235
01:47:52,661 --> 01:47:55,926
Look, Gangu mummy! Heero
is a nice guy!

1236
01:47:56,598 --> 01:47:57,656
Exactly!

1237
01:47:57,733 --> 01:48:00,065
And he loves Ghungroo a lot!

1238
01:48:00,936 --> 01:48:02,995
Heero loves Ghungroo a lot!

1239
01:48:03,672 --> 01:48:07,472
And the most important thing is...

1240
01:48:07,542 --> 01:48:11,205
Heero has never loved any girl
as much as he loves Ghungroo!

1241
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:14,506
You mean to say he has
loved other girls too?

1242
01:48:14,683 --> 01:48:16,173
Papa, many girls!

1243
01:48:17,786 --> 01:48:19,185
I have lost count!

1244
01:48:19,488 --> 01:48:21,479
What... what are you saying? -No, no!

1245
01:48:21,556 --> 01:48:24,218
I mean... - No! This is not
what he meant, mummy!

1246
01:48:24,493 --> 01:48:25,551
What is he saying?

1247
01:48:25,627 --> 01:48:26,958
No, no! This is not what he meant!

1248
01:48:27,496 --> 01:48:28,754
- What does he mean?
- What do you mean?

1249
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:34,694
I mean to say... Heero used to love
one girl a lot once upon a time!

1250
01:48:34,970 --> 01:48:37,700
But now I am 90% sure that this
time it will be fixed for sure!

1251
01:48:38,573 --> 01:48:39,835
- Raj!
- Scoundrel!

1252
01:48:39,975 --> 01:48:41,033
Raj!

1253
01:48:41,243 --> 01:48:42,505
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1254
01:48:42,644 --> 01:48:44,371
- What do you think of my Ghungroo!
- Hang on!

1255
01:48:44,446 --> 01:48:45,835
- What do you think of yourself?
- Let it be!

1256
01:48:45,881 --> 01:48:47,872
- Heero is a nice guy!
- What do you think of yourself?

1257
01:48:49,051 --> 01:48:50,075
I will tell Heero to come!

1258
01:48:50,652 --> 01:48:51,676
- Heero!
- Scoundrel!

1259
01:48:51,953 --> 01:48:53,045
Gangu mummy, let it be!

1260
01:48:53,121 --> 01:48:54,918
This is not what he meant,
Gangu mummy! - Leave!

1261
01:48:55,457 --> 01:48:57,186
- Gangu, keep quiet!
- Don't come back again!

1262
01:48:57,459 --> 01:48:58,983
- Gangu, keep quiet!
- And tell that Heero!

1263
01:48:59,461 --> 01:49:02,988
- If he came here then...
- You will chop him into pieces!

1264
01:49:03,065 --> 01:49:04,930
- I will chop him into pieces!
- Keep quiet!

1265
01:49:05,801 --> 01:49:08,599
Heero! Now what will be our fate?

1266
01:49:20,082 --> 01:49:21,709
Hey! Move! Move!

1267
01:49:22,484 --> 01:49:24,111
Why does this Heero want to die?

1268
01:49:24,186 --> 01:49:27,485
Because... they... are not allowing...

1269
01:49:27,556 --> 01:49:31,686
me to marry Ghungroo!

1270
01:49:32,561 --> 01:49:35,894
Kaliganj's people!

1271
01:49:36,832 --> 01:49:38,231
Goodbye forever!

1272
01:49:38,834 --> 01:49:39,892
Move! Move!

1273
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:43,495
Bye-bye! Goodnight! Bye!

1274
01:49:46,508 --> 01:49:47,566
- Come on!
- Move!

1275
01:49:47,776 --> 01:49:48,834
Look!

1276
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:49,968
Okay! Bye-bye!

1277
01:49:50,112 --> 01:49:51,841
He is shooting himself! I told you!

1278
01:49:52,647 --> 01:49:53,841
He is playing a charade!

1279
01:49:54,082 --> 01:49:56,880
Hey! Play your drama somewhere
else! Come on!

1280
01:49:57,486 --> 01:49:58,953
He will die! He will die!

1281
01:49:59,154 --> 01:50:02,521
Not drama! Now there
will be a sensation!

1282
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:08,461
I am going to kill myself!
Day light murder!

1283
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:09,588
Mummy, he will die!

1284
01:50:09,731 --> 01:50:12,598
And Gangu mummy will be
responsible for it!

1285
01:50:14,136 --> 01:50:15,194
- What is he saying?
- Me!

1286
01:50:15,470 --> 01:50:16,528
Who else?

1287
01:50:16,938 --> 01:50:20,135
Heero wants to marry. Ghungroo
wants to marry.

1288
01:50:20,475 --> 01:50:21,533
- Yes!
- And you...

1289
01:50:24,546 --> 01:50:25,604
Yes!

1290
01:50:26,481 --> 01:50:29,473
Ghungroo, I think... your
mummy didn't get...

1291
01:50:29,518 --> 01:50:32,681
a handsome husband like me.

1292
01:50:33,155 --> 01:50:34,554
That's why she is jealous of you!

1293
01:50:36,558 --> 01:50:38,150
You! I am jealous!

1294
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:41,024
- Go and die!
- No, no, no!

1295
01:50:41,096 --> 01:50:43,496
- I will light your pyre! Go and die!
- No, no!

1296
01:50:43,698 --> 01:50:44,756
Okay!

1297
01:50:44,833 --> 01:50:46,095
- No, mummy! No!
- What...

1298
01:50:46,434 --> 01:50:47,560
Mummy, stop! Mummy!

1299
01:50:47,702 --> 01:50:48,760
- Shut up!
- Gangu!

1300
01:50:48,904 --> 01:50:54,570
Priest! Bye-bye! Ghungroo...
I love you!

1301
01:50:54,910 --> 01:50:56,502
- Come on! Come on! Die!
- Mummy, he will die!

1302
01:50:56,578 --> 01:50:57,636
Shut up! He won't do anything!

1303
01:50:57,712 --> 01:50:58,770
Raj! My friend!

1304
01:51:00,982 --> 01:51:02,040
Jai Hind!

1305
01:51:02,684 --> 01:51:03,742
I am going.

1306
01:51:04,653 --> 01:51:10,455
Because of this old lady... a
lover boy is going to die!

1307
01:51:11,126 --> 01:51:12,787
Cold blooded murder!

1308
01:51:13,061 --> 01:51:15,052
Come on! I have to watch
the serial! Die quickly!

1309
01:51:15,463 --> 01:51:18,523
Listen! Listen! This is not
a murder! It's a suicide!

1310
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:19,658
- You shut up!
- Yes!

1311
01:51:20,068 --> 01:51:23,469
You... be it suicide or murder...

1312
01:51:23,538 --> 01:51:26,803
the result is the same!

1313
01:51:27,943 --> 01:51:29,001
Then?

1314
01:51:30,011 --> 01:51:31,069
Gangu mummy!

1315
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:34,474
If you didn't go to prison
after my death...

1316
01:51:34,516 --> 01:51:37,883
if the police didn't
arrest you... then...

1317
01:51:40,822 --> 01:51:41,880
Hey! Help!

1318
01:51:42,624 --> 01:51:45,957
Then I will come back! As a ghost!

1319
01:51:48,763 --> 01:51:52,961
And he will haunt Kaliganj!

1320
01:51:57,105 --> 01:51:58,163
Gangu mummy!

1321
01:51:59,574 --> 01:52:05,570
My soul will enter your fish's body!

1322
01:52:06,448 --> 01:52:11,078
And she will make
your life miserable!

1323
01:52:13,054 --> 01:52:14,851
Say yes! He will die!

1324
01:52:15,790 --> 01:52:16,848
You people won't lose anything!

1325
01:52:16,925 --> 01:52:17,983
She is my daughter! Keep quiet!

1326
01:52:18,059 --> 01:52:21,460
Gangu mummy... you won't find such
a nice guy anywhere else.

1327
01:52:21,529 --> 01:52:22,587
Shut up!

1328
01:52:22,664 --> 01:52:26,600
- Gangu mummy... the guy is not so bad.
- Yes!

1329
01:52:27,002 --> 01:52:28,731
End the matter here!

1330
01:52:29,004 --> 01:52:30,801
You won't get stuck
in the police mess!

1331
01:52:31,873 --> 01:52:34,671
And Ghungroo will gradually tame him!

1332
01:52:34,743 --> 01:52:35,801
- Hurry up!
- Say yes!

1333
01:52:35,877 --> 01:52:37,208
My arm is aching!

1334
01:52:40,081 --> 01:52:42,879
- Mummy, say yes!
- Come on! Say yes!

1335
01:52:43,485 --> 01:52:44,918
Come on! Say yes! Say yes!

1336
01:52:46,021 --> 01:52:47,079
Come on! Say yes! Say yes!

1337
01:52:47,155 --> 01:52:49,020
Come on! Say yes! Say yes!

1338
01:52:49,557 --> 01:52:53,493
Come on! Say it! Say yes!

1339
01:52:55,964 --> 01:52:57,022
Yes!

1340
01:52:57,165 --> 01:52:58,223
What did you say?

1341
01:52:59,634 --> 01:53:01,226
Drunkard! Didn't you hear? Yes!

1342
01:53:07,242 --> 01:53:10,769
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

1343
01:53:27,529 --> 01:53:29,724
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1344
01:53:30,131 --> 01:53:31,189
Yes!

1345
01:53:31,533 --> 01:53:33,000
- Yes!
- Yes!

1346
01:53:33,535 --> 01:53:39,940
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1347
01:53:47,082 --> 01:53:48,811
- Rehmad.
- Yes.

1348
01:53:49,684 --> 01:53:51,481
Seems like a cat has entered
in the house...

1349
01:53:51,519 --> 01:53:52,747
take care she might spoil the milk.

1350
01:53:53,021 --> 01:53:54,545
Yes father, I will take a look.

1351
01:53:55,757 --> 01:53:56,815
What happened?

1352
01:53:57,692 --> 01:54:00,559
- Ghungroo!
- Ghungroo, what Ghungroo father?

1353
01:54:02,097 --> 01:54:04,031
I thought as if I heard
Ghungroo's voice.

1354
01:54:04,232 --> 01:54:05,893
No father, it was a
cat I drove it away.

1355
01:54:07,235 --> 01:54:10,898
Today is Meena's birthday and
father is not letting me go.

1356
01:54:11,239 --> 01:54:12,763
Please talk to father.

1357
01:54:13,041 --> 01:54:15,771
- Naqvi sir!
- Ghungroo! Ghungroo!

1358
01:54:15,844 --> 01:54:16,902
Where is Rehmad?

1359
01:54:17,512 --> 01:54:19,503
You are still here, you know...

1360
01:54:19,547 --> 01:54:20,946
a terrible thing has
happened with Laila.

1361
01:54:21,049 --> 01:54:24,746
You know dear, I felt as
if I heard your voice.

1362
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:27,647
- My voice.
- What happened to Laila?

1363
01:54:27,856 --> 01:54:28,914
It met with an accident.

1364
01:54:28,990 --> 01:54:30,116
Are you fine dear?

1365
01:54:30,592 --> 01:54:33,652
First class. But Laila is
in a terrible condition.

1366
01:54:34,062 --> 01:54:36,189
- She cannot see.
- She cannot see?

1367
01:54:36,598 --> 01:54:38,532
Yes, her headlights
have been damaged...

1368
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,864
her head, her engine has overheated.

1369
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:44,061
And that's why I have
come to take Rehmad.

1370
01:54:44,272 --> 01:54:46,467
Go son go, take him along dear.

1371
01:54:47,475 --> 01:54:50,467
But remember one thing, after
you finish your work...

1372
01:54:50,545 --> 01:54:52,479
bring him back here.

1373
01:54:52,714 --> 01:54:54,909
He was being stubborn about
going to the town.

1374
01:54:55,483 --> 01:54:59,476
Don't worry Naqvi sir, I will
bring him back here no tension.

1375
01:54:59,621 --> 01:55:01,555
Dear, he is your responsibility.

1376
01:55:02,957 --> 01:55:05,084
Of course, he is my responsibility.

1377
01:55:33,655 --> 01:55:34,713
Hail Veero.

1378
01:55:53,007 --> 01:55:55,999
I found one from there.

1379
01:56:26,975 --> 01:56:28,772
The innocent always die.

1380
01:56:30,512 --> 01:56:33,913
By the hands of America,
Al-Qaida, and me.

1381
01:56:37,619 --> 01:56:38,881
Everyone's motive is something else.

1382
01:56:39,921 --> 01:56:45,518
America's is Al-Qaida,
Al-Qaida's is America...

1383
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:57,469
You just got caught up in the middle.

1384
01:57:11,486 --> 01:57:13,886
So what if you died, everyone
has to die one day.

1385
01:57:14,822 --> 01:57:16,153
You died first, I will die later.

1386
01:57:18,626 --> 01:57:19,684
Just don't feel bad.

1387
01:57:20,695 --> 01:57:21,753
Don't feel bad.

1388
01:57:25,833 --> 01:57:26,891
Hey Tambhe...

1389
01:57:27,902 --> 01:57:30,700
Move him he is sitting on my chair.

1390
01:57:38,580 --> 01:57:41,708
Narsimha sir, they killed Ahmed.

1391
01:58:07,141 --> 01:58:08,672
Gandhi said, if you are
slapped on one cheek...

1392
01:58:08,743 --> 01:58:10,875
then show your other too.

1393
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,914
I am not Gandhi, I am Babban.

1394
01:58:34,969 --> 01:58:38,769
Crazy girl, what are you doing
here, where is your Laila?

1395
01:58:40,108 --> 01:58:41,166
Where is your Laila?

1396
01:58:42,777 --> 01:58:46,440
Naqmi sir... he used
to love Meena a lot...

1397
01:58:46,481 --> 01:58:49,939
and he used to go
to town to meet him.

1398
01:58:50,752 --> 01:58:52,845
And Meena... Meena...

1399
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:01,454
It was Meena's birthday and he
wanted to go and meet her...

1400
01:59:01,529 --> 01:59:04,464
and I asked him to go to town...

1401
01:59:04,532 --> 01:59:07,467
I thought no one will find out and...

1402
01:59:09,604 --> 01:59:11,595
And he will come back Naqvi sir.

1403
01:59:13,141 --> 01:59:16,668
Rehmad... Rehmad was my
responsibility but...

1404
01:59:17,945 --> 01:59:19,469
I made a very big mistake!

1405
01:59:23,718 --> 01:59:27,085
Where is Rehmad, is he fine?

1406
01:59:28,156 --> 01:59:32,684
I made a mistake Naqvi sir,
I made a mistake.

1407
01:59:32,827 --> 01:59:33,885
Where is Rehmad?

1408
01:59:58,453 --> 01:59:59,579
I made a mistake.

1409
02:00:31,085 --> 02:00:32,609
It is time for my prayer.

1410
02:00:52,507 --> 02:00:55,032
But why did Babban kill an innocent?

1411
02:00:56,978 --> 02:00:58,878
There is no one innocent
in this world?

1412
02:01:00,448 --> 02:01:01,574
Who makes the government?

1413
02:01:04,051 --> 02:01:05,075
The common people.

1414
02:01:07,588 --> 02:01:11,456
Who gives money to the
government to catch us?

1415
02:01:12,593 --> 02:01:13,651
The common people.

1416
02:01:15,596 --> 02:01:16,654
Then who is our enemy?

1417
02:01:18,533 --> 02:01:19,591
The common people.

1418
02:01:22,470 --> 02:01:24,062
Whether it is America or Kaliganj...

1419
02:01:27,742 --> 02:01:30,677
the common people always die.

1420
02:01:31,145 --> 02:01:35,479
That is lid is dead, the rest
of you are still alive...

1421
02:01:35,516 --> 02:01:39,953
because Babban has
still not killed you.

1422
02:01:40,621 --> 02:01:42,486
But maybe you all wish to die.

1423
02:01:44,091 --> 02:01:48,084
If you don't want to, then handover
Raj and Heero to us.

1424
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:54,429
Narsimha, not just
me everyone knows...

1425
02:01:54,502 --> 02:01:55,969
that you are right.

1426
02:01:56,771 --> 02:01:59,968
But we have to face a
gangster like Babban.

1427
02:02:00,708 --> 02:02:03,438
That's why we have been
supporting you till now.

1428
02:02:04,445 --> 02:02:06,436
But now he killed Badri's brother.

1429
02:02:07,048 --> 02:02:08,072
Bansal's sir's two sons.

1430
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:10,074
Milli he died too.

1431
02:02:10,685 --> 02:02:12,448
9 people in the last three days.

1432
02:02:13,187 --> 02:02:15,121
If this keeps on continuing,
then what will we do?

1433
02:02:16,123 --> 02:02:17,554
Entire Kaliganj will be
eradicated because...

1434
02:02:17,625 --> 02:02:19,857
of these Jai and Heero.

1435
02:02:20,461 --> 02:02:21,519
What do you all want?

1436
02:02:21,596 --> 02:02:25,589
We want you and Raj to
go out of Kaliganj.

1437
02:02:25,867 --> 02:02:30,930
No, sending you out of Kaliganj
won't solve anything.

1438
02:02:32,473 --> 02:02:34,464
They have clearly said...

1439
02:02:34,542 --> 02:02:36,942
that we have to hand them over.

1440
02:02:37,011 --> 02:02:38,137
Or else they will keep committing
such murders.

1441
02:02:38,679 --> 02:02:41,113
What are you saying,
can you understand?

1442
02:02:41,883 --> 02:02:42,975
Aren't you ashamed?

1443
02:02:44,518 --> 02:02:47,078
You want to handover Raj
and Heero to Babban.

1444
02:02:47,555 --> 02:02:52,492
Those who didn't care for
their own lives for you.

1445
02:02:54,228 --> 02:02:55,820
Understand this.

1446
02:02:58,032 --> 02:03:01,490
This battle is not with Gabbar,
but with the fear...

1447
02:03:01,569 --> 02:03:04,504
that Babban has rooted in us.

1448
02:03:05,907 --> 02:03:08,705
So what if we die to
eradicate that fear.

1449
02:03:09,577 --> 02:03:11,704
Death is better then leading
a fearful life.

1450
02:03:11,779 --> 02:03:12,905
Stop lecturing!

1451
02:03:16,717 --> 02:03:18,947
Your husband has died, your brother!

1452
02:03:19,587 --> 02:03:21,782
But why are you dragging
us in your fight?

1453
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:24,052
And if you want to fight,
then do it yourselves!

1454
02:03:24,659 --> 02:03:25,717
Go and die!

1455
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:27,118
Why should we bear the consequences?

1456
02:03:29,130 --> 02:03:30,529
Mr. Narsimha, this is happening
because of you...

1457
02:03:30,598 --> 02:03:32,532
because of your enmity!

1458
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:34,534
And we innocent have to die!

1459
02:03:37,004 --> 02:03:38,596
Who is talking?

1460
02:03:39,206 --> 02:03:40,537
Who is he? Who is he?

1461
02:03:41,008 --> 02:03:42,066
Ask him to talk to me!

1462
02:03:42,143 --> 02:03:43,667
If you have the courage
then talk to me!

1463
02:03:44,946 --> 02:03:45,913
Don't you have some sense?

1464
02:03:46,714 --> 02:03:48,113
And if you don't, then
keep your mouth shut!

1465
02:03:50,184 --> 02:03:52,550
I am blind but I can see
better than all of you

1466
02:03:54,221 --> 02:03:58,487
This battle is against our fear,
and Babban's cruelty...

1467
02:03:58,559 --> 02:04:04,020
because he fighting to imprison us.

1468
02:04:04,565 --> 02:04:05,623
You should feel ashamed!

1469
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:07,634
If you have the courage, then
point fingers at yourself.

1470
02:04:10,171 --> 02:04:13,504
Mr. Narsimha came here to fulfil
his duty and the police duty...

1471
02:04:13,574 --> 02:04:18,170
and what's his mistake that
Babban made us his enemies.

1472
02:04:21,048 --> 02:04:23,915
Yes, he made one mistake.

1473
02:04:24,919 --> 02:04:27,513
He thought for such selfish
people like you.

1474
02:04:28,656 --> 02:04:30,521
You don't want to live like this...

1475
02:04:30,591 --> 02:04:31,649
you want to go live out
on the sea, then go.

1476
02:04:32,126 --> 02:04:33,855
You want to return to
your village, then go!

1477
02:04:34,662 --> 02:04:36,527
Anyone can go wherever they want...

1478
02:04:36,597 --> 02:04:37,996
but I will not leave
this place and go!

1479
02:04:40,067 --> 02:04:45,198
I have lost my son,
I don't regret it.

1480
02:04:46,741 --> 02:04:51,474
I would want to request to Allah...

1481
02:04:51,545 --> 02:04:55,675
to give me a chance to achieve
martyr in this battle.

1482
02:04:58,486 --> 02:05:03,480
So that if I ever meet my son,
then I can tell him...

1483
02:05:03,557 --> 02:05:09,154
that Rehmad, your old
father is not a coward.

1484
02:05:11,565 --> 02:05:14,033
He died fighting Babban.

1485
02:05:40,528 --> 02:05:43,986
Yes Pradhan speaking, I want
to talk to Tambhe sir.

1486
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:49,933
Yes Tambhe sir, we have decided.

1487
02:05:51,205 --> 02:05:53,139
To handover Heero and Raj to you.

1488
02:05:54,475 --> 02:05:55,533
Pradhan!

1489
02:05:57,478 --> 02:05:58,536
Pradhan.

1490
02:05:59,613 --> 02:06:00,671
Where are you, buddy?

1491
02:06:01,015 --> 02:06:02,073
Pradhan.

1492
02:06:03,717 --> 02:06:04,775
- Sanam.
- Yes.

1493
02:06:05,686 --> 02:06:06,812
They had asked us to come
to this place, isn't it?

1494
02:06:07,088 --> 02:06:08,146
They had.

1495
02:06:13,894 --> 02:06:15,486
Are they trying to fool us?

1496
02:06:15,830 --> 02:06:16,888
You are right?

1497
02:06:45,526 --> 02:06:46,584
Heero!

1498
02:07:18,492 --> 02:07:19,550
Kill me!

1499
02:07:21,162 --> 02:07:23,892
What are you looking at? Kill me!

1500
02:07:24,698 --> 02:07:26,495
Come on kill me! End it!

1501
02:07:27,968 --> 02:07:29,026
Kill me!

1502
02:08:40,975 --> 02:08:42,840
We are not Gandhi too.

1503
02:09:06,667 --> 02:09:09,135
Tambhe, understand it.

1504
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:14,607
You are about to die.

1505
02:09:31,558 --> 02:09:32,616
I am enjoying it.

1506
02:09:34,094 --> 02:09:35,618
I am enjoying it a lot.

1507
02:09:35,829 --> 02:09:37,888
I am enjoying seeing you die.

1508
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:41,024
All my life you helped me.

1509
02:09:42,569 --> 02:09:46,562
Now that you are dying, you
are giving me a new zest.

1510
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:47,698
Zest.

1511
02:09:48,108 --> 02:09:52,044
Now the real fun will begin!
Now the real fun will begin!

1512
02:09:52,112 --> 02:09:55,479
Now the real fun will begin!

1513
02:09:57,851 --> 02:10:02,117
They have fanned the fire. Fanned it.

1514
02:10:08,128 --> 02:10:11,188
Babban will now shower fire.

1515
02:10:12,599 --> 02:10:16,797
Fire! Fire!

1516
02:10:30,584 --> 02:10:34,611
Hey! Tambhe.

1517
02:10:46,633 --> 02:10:47,691
What happened?

1518
02:11:07,054 --> 02:11:08,453
After Tambhe's death,

1519
02:11:08,522 --> 02:11:15,189
Babban will
become dangerous for a while.

1520
02:11:15,529 --> 02:11:16,587
How is that?

1521
02:11:18,599 --> 02:11:23,798
Before being extinguished
the lamp flickers brightly.

1522
02:11:49,096 --> 02:11:51,963
Heero, you go on I am coming.

1523
02:11:53,033 --> 02:11:55,831
I want to talk to inspector sir.

1524
02:12:01,909 --> 02:12:02,967
Inspector sir...

1525
02:12:09,082 --> 02:12:12,779
I wanted to talk to you.

1526
02:12:12,853 --> 02:12:13,911
About Devi?

1527
02:12:24,731 --> 02:12:26,596
I have told Heero clearly...

1528
02:12:26,667 --> 02:12:29,659
if you want to marry me then you
will have to leave all this.

1529
02:12:30,537 --> 02:12:32,471
Its not that I can't
live without him.

1530
02:12:33,073 --> 02:12:34,199
Laila is enough for me.

1531
02:12:35,742 --> 02:12:39,200
I have given him last warning that
locking horns with Ghungroo...

1532
02:12:47,621 --> 02:12:52,490
All I want to say is that if you
have lost something in life...

1533
02:12:52,559 --> 02:12:56,154
that doesn't mean
that life has ended.

1534
02:13:00,033 --> 02:13:02,695
The real motive of life
is to be happy.

1535
02:13:06,773 --> 02:13:10,971
All I want to say is that...

1536
02:13:11,578 --> 02:13:13,239
I will be very happy
seeing you happy.

1537
02:13:15,115 --> 02:13:17,515
And if that happiness is
returning in your life...

1538
02:13:17,551 --> 02:13:22,250
then it will not be right
to try to stop it.

1539
02:13:30,531 --> 02:13:31,930
You are really too much.

1540
02:13:32,065 --> 02:13:33,726
He was talking about Raj.

1541
02:13:33,934 --> 02:13:34,992
About Raj.

1542
02:13:38,138 --> 02:13:40,732
Whenever you talk to me about Raj...

1543
02:13:40,807 --> 02:13:46,211
I can clearly understand
your feelings about him.

1544
02:13:46,713 --> 02:13:50,979
But I... - Even Mr. Narsimha
has understood this.

1545
02:13:51,485 --> 02:13:53,544
In short, he has no problem.

1546
02:13:54,021 --> 02:13:55,545
What are you saying Ghungroo?

1547
02:13:56,023 --> 02:14:00,153
I am saying that, except for
you all of us know that you...

1548
02:14:01,895 --> 02:14:04,830
- What?
- That you love Raj.

1549
02:14:08,168 --> 02:14:10,102
Stop pretending and admit it.

1550
02:14:10,504 --> 02:14:12,699
And now I will go and
tell everyone about it.

1551
02:14:14,041 --> 02:14:16,100
Ghungroo! Ghungroo, wait!

1552
02:14:28,055 --> 02:14:29,113
Heero!

1553
02:14:31,058 --> 02:14:32,525
Do you know what has happened?

1554
02:15:21,575 --> 02:15:25,534
So this is Ms. Kaliganj.

1555
02:15:30,150 --> 02:15:31,742
What do you eat?

1556
02:15:33,587 --> 02:15:35,054
Everything's made of pure ghee.

1557
02:15:41,595 --> 02:15:43,062
Where is your...

1558
02:15:45,532 --> 02:15:46,863
Where is your...

1559
02:15:49,136 --> 02:15:50,797
Here he is.

1560
02:15:52,539 --> 02:15:54,666
Heero! Heero!

1561
02:16:41,588 --> 02:16:42,919
Come.

1562
02:16:47,127 --> 02:16:49,186
Look Babban, leave her. Let her go.

1563
02:16:51,064 --> 02:16:53,794
I will kill you, I will kill you!

1564
02:16:57,070 --> 02:17:00,938
Look, your enmity is with
me, let the girl go.

1565
02:17:11,485 --> 02:17:14,215
If you have the courage, then fight
me! Kill me if you want to!

1566
02:17:14,888 --> 02:17:15,946
Let the girl go!

1567
02:17:21,027 --> 02:17:22,085
Throw down the gun!

1568
02:17:23,630 --> 02:17:27,031
Lower it! Throw down the gun!
Throw down the gun!

1569
02:17:28,568 --> 02:17:30,763
Don't take tension! I am going!

1570
02:17:30,837 --> 02:17:31,895
I am going.

1571
02:18:47,581 --> 02:18:52,143
First! First! Come out!

1572
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:56,917
- Come out! Come out!
- Don't come out!

1573
02:18:58,058 --> 02:19:01,516
Heero, don't insult your friendship.

1574
02:19:01,595 --> 02:19:02,721
Don't listen to him.

1575
02:19:02,929 --> 02:19:05,056
If he dies, you will die too.

1576
02:19:05,131 --> 02:19:06,530
Heero, run away.

1577
02:19:06,733 --> 02:19:07,859
Don't be crazy!

1578
02:19:09,736 --> 02:19:10,794
Don't be crazy!

1579
02:19:10,871 --> 02:19:14,204
Heero, think about Ghungroo!

1580
02:19:14,474 --> 02:19:15,532
Think about Ghungroo!

1581
02:19:15,609 --> 02:19:16,667
Don' worry about me.

1582
02:19:16,743 --> 02:19:17,801
Where is Ghungroo?

1583
02:19:17,878 --> 02:19:20,506
If you come out, then
we all will be killed!

1584
02:19:22,115 --> 02:19:29,115
Heero, your friend had come out
Like a brave man on Diwali.

1585
02:19:29,489 --> 02:19:31,753
You are a coward.

1586
02:19:31,825 --> 02:19:33,554
You scoundrel.

1587
02:19:35,028 --> 02:19:36,552
I am giving you a last chance.

1588
02:19:37,564 --> 02:19:38,690
I will count till three.

1589
02:19:39,566 --> 02:19:43,093
- 3!
- No! No Heero!

1590
02:19:43,570 --> 02:19:45,504
Get out of here Heero.

1591
02:19:45,572 --> 02:19:46,698
Don't get emotional!

1592
02:19:46,773 --> 02:19:47,967
Try to understand the situation.

1593
02:19:48,041 --> 02:19:53,877
Run away from here, go get help.

1594
02:19:54,881 --> 02:19:57,543
Think about Ghungroo! Go from here!

1595
02:19:58,752 --> 02:19:59,912
Run away from here!

1596
02:20:00,453 --> 02:20:01,647
That's the only way!

1597
02:20:09,796 --> 02:20:11,127
Seems like he ran away.

1598
02:20:13,466 --> 02:20:14,524
- Go from here.
- No.

1599
02:20:14,801 --> 02:20:16,792
- Go and inform everyone.
- No.

1600
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:18,064
There is very little
time left, Ghungroo.

1601
02:20:18,538 --> 02:20:19,596
No, Heero.

1602
02:20:19,673 --> 02:20:24,076
For Ghungroo, he left you for love.

1603
02:20:25,078 --> 02:20:27,808
- Try to understand, go.
- No.

1604
02:20:27,881 --> 02:20:28,905
Go, go.

1605
02:20:29,516 --> 02:20:30,574
Go.

1606
02:20:38,892 --> 02:20:39,950
Go.

1607
02:20:42,629 --> 02:20:43,687
He betrayed his friendship.

1608
02:20:43,763 --> 02:20:44,821
He left you.

1609
02:20:58,578 --> 02:21:03,140
Babban's enmity is better than
his friendship, isn't it?

1610
02:21:04,951 --> 02:21:06,111
What do you say Tambhe?

1611
02:21:34,481 --> 02:21:37,473
Being scared of Babban is right.

1612
02:21:38,718 --> 02:21:41,551
Fighting Babban, wrong.

1613
02:25:36,656 --> 02:25:37,714
Heero.

1614
02:25:38,124 --> 02:25:40,524
The pain that you are feeling now...

1615
02:25:41,194 --> 02:25:47,133
I have hidden that pain
in my heart for a year.

1616
02:25:48,134 --> 02:25:53,595
With the hope that I will kill
Babban with my own hands.

1617
02:25:55,742 --> 02:25:57,209
Consider it my request or plead.

1618
02:25:58,678 --> 02:26:01,010
Let me kill him.

1619
02:26:03,716 --> 02:26:06,082
Let me kill him.

1620
02:26:59,939 --> 02:27:02,806
I killed myself.
