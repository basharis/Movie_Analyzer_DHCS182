1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,192  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Corporal Barry, eight paces forward...</i>

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,309  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>... march!</i>

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,548  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:482 Y2:509
Corporal Barry.

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,112  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:509
You're a gallant soldier,
and evidently of good stock...

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,995  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:509
...but you're idle and unprincipled.

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,596  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:504
You're a bad influence on the men.

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,909  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:509
And for all your bravery,
I'm sure you'll come to no good.

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,680  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:509
I hope the Colonel is mistaken.

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,038  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:509
I have fallen into bad company,
but I've only done as other soldiers do.

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,079  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:509
I've never had a friend
or protector before...

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,879  X1:178 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:509
...to show that I was worthy
of better things.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,197  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:504
The Colonel may say I'm ruined,
and send me to the Devil.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,557  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:509
But, I would go to the Devil
to serve the Regiment.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,154  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Corporal Barry, fall in.</i>

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,192  X1:128 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>The war ended and Barry's regiment</i>
<i>was garrisoned in the Capital.</i>

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,475  X1:087 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>He had, for some time, ingratiated himself</i>
<i>with Captain Potzdorf...</i>

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,598  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... whose confidence in him</i>
<i>was about to bring its reward.</i>

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,274  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:509
Good morning, Redmond.

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,918  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:509
Good morning, Captain.

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,874  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:504
I should like you to meet my uncle,
the Minister of Police.

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,957  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:509
Good morning, Herr Minister.

22
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,229  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:504
Redmond...

23
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,638  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:509
...I've spoken to the Minister regarding
your services and your fortune is made.

24
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,151  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:509
We shall get you out of the Army...

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,710  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:507
...appoint you to the Police Bureau,
and, in time...

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,309  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:509
...we'll allow you to move
in a better sphere.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,399  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:509
Thank you, Captain.

28
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,831  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:509
Your loyalty to me and service
to the Regiment has pleased me.

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,596  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:509
Now there is another occasion
on which you can assist us.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,399  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:509
If you succeed...

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,552  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:509
...your reward will be secure.

32
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,878  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:509
I'll do my best, sir.

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,036  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:509
There is a gentleman in Berlin
in the service of the Empress of Austria.

34
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,872  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:504
He calls himself
the Chevalier de Balibari.

35
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,555  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:509
He appears to be a professional gambler.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,319  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:504
He's a libertine:

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,230  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:509
Fond of women, of good food...

38
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,633  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:509
...polished, obliging.

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,475  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:482 Y2:509
He speaks French and German indifferently.

40
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,070  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:504
But we have reason to fancy
that Monsieur de Balibari...

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,588  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:509
...is a native of your country of Ireland.

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,319  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:509
And that he has come here as a spy.

43
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,111  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:509
Your knowledge of English...

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,750  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:509
...makes you an ideal choice
to go into his service...

45
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,234  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:509
...and find out whether or not
he is a spy.

46
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,515  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:509
Does this assignment interest you?

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,518  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:509
Minister, I'm interested in anything
that can be of service to you...

48
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,272  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and Captain Potzdorf.

49
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,835  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:509
You will not know a word of English.

50
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,835  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:509
If the Chevalier remarks on your accent,
say you are Hungarian.

51
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,478  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:504
You served in the war.

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,838  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:509
You left the Army for medical reasons...

53
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,591  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:509
...then served Monsieur de Quellenberg
for two years.

54
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,909  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:509
He's now with the Army in Silesia,
but you'll have a certificate from him.

55
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,718  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Good morning, Your Honour.</i>

56
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,718  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>So you are the young man</i>
<i>recommended by Seebach.</i>

57
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,070  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Yes, Your Honour,</i>
<i>here are my credentials.</i>

58
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,231  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Your name is Lazlo Zilagy?</i>

59
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,679  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:482 Y2:507
<i>Yes, Your Honour.</i>

60
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,518  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Monsieur de Quellenberg</i>
<i>recommends you highly.</i>

61
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,796  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Monsieur is a very good man.</i>

62
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,478  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>It was imprudent of him...</i>

63
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,078  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... but when Barry saw</i>
<i>the Chevalier's splendour...</i>

64
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,593  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>... and noble manner...</i>

65
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,793  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... he felt unable to keep disguise</i>
<i>with him.</i>

66
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,630  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>Those who have never been exiled...</i>

67
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,670  X1:173 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... know not what it is to hear</i>
<i>a friendly voice in captivity...</i>

68
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,196  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>... and would not understand the cause...</i>

69
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,432  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... of the burst of feeling</i>
<i>now about to take place.</i>

70
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,910  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>You seem the right one to me.</i>

71
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,958  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Thank you, Your Honour.</i>

72
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,868  X1:285 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Are you ill?</i>

73
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,595  X1:329 X2:389 Y1:482 Y2:504
Sir...

74
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,436  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:509
...I have a confession to make to you.

75
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,714  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:504
I'm an Irishman.

76
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,718  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:509
My name is Redmond Barry.

77
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,640  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:509
I was abducted into the Prussian Army.

78
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,310  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:509
Now I've been put into your service...

79
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,557  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:507
...by my Captain Potzdorf
and his uncle, the Minister of Police...

80
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,271  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:448 Y2:509
...to serve as a watch
upon your... actions...

81
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,268  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and to give information to them.

82
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,350  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>The Chevalier was much affected</i>
<i>at thus finding one of his countrymen.</i>

83
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,831  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>For he too was an exile.</i>

84
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,115  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>And a friendly voice, a look...</i>

85
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,833  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... brought the old country</i>
<i>back to his memory.</i>

86
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,672  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:509
He is very religious
and attends church regularly.

87
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,799  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:504
After Mass he comes home for breakfast.

88
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,269  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:509
He then takes an airing in his carriage.

89
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,636  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Barry presented his reports</i>
<i>regularly to the Minister.</i>

90
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,036  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>The details were arranged</i>
<i>beforehand with the Chevalier.</i>

91
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,233  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>He was instructed to tell the truth...</i>

92
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,673  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... as much as his story</i>
<i>would possibly bear.</i>

93
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,399  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>The information he gave</i>
<i>was very minute and accurate...</i>

94
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,832  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... though not very important.</i>

95
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,118  X1:173 X2:551 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Wine or punch, Your Honour?</i>

96
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,750  X1:326 X2:395 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>Wine.</i>

97
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,475  X1:121 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>It was agreed that Barry should keep</i>
<i>his character of valet.</i>

98
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,269  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>That, before strangers,</i>
<i>he should not know a word of English.</i>

99
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,751  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>And that he should keep a lookout</i>
<i>on the trumps when serving the wine.</i>

100
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,518  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Having excellent eyesight...</i>

101
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,958  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... and a natural aptitude...</i>

102
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,356  X1:121 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... he was able to give his dear patron</i>
<i>much assistance...</i>

103
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,313  X1:206 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... against his opponents</i>
<i>at the green table.</i>

104
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,872  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Lf, for instance, he wiped</i>
<i>the table with a napkin...</i>

105
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,828  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... the enemy was strong in Diamonds.</i>

106
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,989  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>If he adjusted a chair it meant Ace King.</i>

107
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,390  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>If he said, "Punch or wine, My Lord?"...</i>

108
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,636  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:507
<i>... Hearts were meant, and so forth.</i>

109
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,832  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>The Prince of Tübingen...</i>

110
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,515  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... who had intimate connections</i>
<i>with the Great Frederick...</i>

111
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,430  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... was passionately fond of play</i>
<i>as were the gentlemen...</i>

112
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,995  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... of almost all the Courts of Europe.</i>

113
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,430  X1:166 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:507
<i>You owe 15,500 frederick d'or.</i>

114
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,509  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:504
Chevalier...

115
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,191  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:509
...though I cannot say how...

116
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,870  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:509
...I believe you have cheated me.

117
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,671  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:509
I deny Your Grace's accusation...

118
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,113  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:509
...and beg you to say
how you have been cheated.

119
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,675  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:482 Y2:504
I don't know.

120
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,312  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:504
But I believe I have been.

121
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,188  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:507
Your Grace owes me
15,500 frederick d'or...

122
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,311  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:509
...which I have honourably won.

123
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,549  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:504
Chevalier...

124
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,470  X1:138 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:509
...if you will have your money now
you must fight for it.

125
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,198  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:509
If you will be patient...

126
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,034  X1:143 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:504
...maybe I will pay you something
another time.

127
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,237  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:504
Your Grace, if I am to be so tame
as to take this...

128
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,191  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:509
...then I must give up an honourable
and lucrative occupation.

129
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,230  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:504
I have said all there is to be said.

130
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,751  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:509
I am at your disposal
for whatever purposes you wish.

131
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,115  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:509
Good night.

132
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,152  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:504
Was the Prince cheated?

133
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,030  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:507
In as far as I am able to tell,
Herr Minister, no.

134
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,630  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:509
I believe he won the money fairly.

135
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,076  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:504
What are the Chevalier's intentions?

136
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,349  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:504
I'm not sure.

137
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,158  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:509
The Prince told him that if he wanted
his money he'd have to fight for it.

138
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,154  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:509
A meeting with the Prince is impossible.

139
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,429  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:504
The Prince has left him no other choice.

140
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,513  X1:094 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:509
Will you be able to return here tomorrow
without arousing suspicion?

141
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,953  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:504
I know they won't allow a meeting
with the Prince.

142
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,472  X1:096 X2:624 Y1:448 Y2:509
But if I say that, do you know any reason
why he'll pay me what he owes?

143
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,032  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:504
You must tell them I intend
to demand satisfaction.

144
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,156  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:509
Don't look so downcast, my boy.

145
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,508  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:509
They cannot harm me,
the Austrian Embassy will see to that.

146
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,278  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:509
The worst they can do is send me
out of this dreary country of theirs.

147
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,393  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:509
If they should, don't worry...

148
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,191  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:509
...you shall not be left behind.

149
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,319  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:504
Have no fear of that.

150
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,029  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:509
The King has determined to send
the Chevalier out of the country.

151
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,315  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:509
Has he already demanded satisfaction?

152
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,192  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:509
Not yet, but I believe he intends to...

153
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,639  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:482 Y2:509
...possibly today.

154
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,556  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:504
Then this must be done tomorrow.

155
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,877  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:509
All the arrangements are made.

156
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,559  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:509
You said he takes a drive
after breakfast every day.

157
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,795  X1:306 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:507
Yes, sir.

158
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,037  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:509
Is there any reason he should do
any different tomorrow?

159
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,315  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:482 Y2:507
No, sir.

160
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,910  X1:321 X2:396 Y1:482 Y2:504
Good.

161
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,592  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:509
When the Chevalier comes out
to his carriage in the morning...

162
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,037  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:504
...two Officers will meet him
and escort him to the frontier.

163
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,990  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:509
His baggage will be sent after him.

164
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,389  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:482 Y2:504
Excellent.

165
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,355  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>At ten o'clock the next morning...</i>

166
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,036  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>... the Chevalier de Balibari...</i>

167
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,273  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... went out for his regular morning drive.</i>

168
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,118  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:509
Where's my servant, Lazlo?

169
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,915  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:509
I will let down the steps, Your Honour.

170
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,549  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:504
What is this about?

171
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,993  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:509
Please get inside.

172
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,993  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:504
Am I under arrest?

173
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,397  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:509
We're driving to the frontier.

174
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,955  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:504
Frontier? But I'm on my way
to the Austrian Ambassador's house.

175
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,308  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:504
My orders are to escort you
to the frontier...

176
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,630  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and see you safely across the border.

177
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,832  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:509
But, I'm not going to the frontier.

178
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,833  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:504
I have very important business
at the Austrian Ambassador's house.

179
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,478  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:509
My orders are to take Your Honour
to the frontier by any means necessary.

180
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,399  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:509
If you come willingly...

181
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,358  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:509
...I'm to give you this purse
on behalf of the Prince of Tübingen...

182
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,476  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:509
...containing 2,000 frederick d'or.

183
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,037  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:509
All Europe shall hear of this.

184
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,590  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>And so, without papers or passport...</i>

185
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,353  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... and under the eyes</i>
<i>of two Prussian Officers...</i>

186
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,117  X1:100 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... Barry was escorted across the frontier</i>
<i>into Saxony and freedom.</i>

187
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,151  X1:111 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>The Chevalier himself had uneventfully</i>
<i>crossed the frontier the night before.</i>

188
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,438  X1:134 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>By these wonderful circumstances,</i>
<i>Barry was once more free...</i>

189
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,074  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... and began his professional work</i>
<i>as a gamester...</i>

190
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,550  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... resolving, thenceforward and forever,</i>
<i>to live the life of a gentleman.</i>

191
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,148  X1:270 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>The four wins.</i>

192
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,359  X1:096 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Soon he and the Chevalier were received</i>
<i>in all the Courts of Europe...</i>

193
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,833  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... and were speedily...</i>

194
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,230  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... in the very best society</i>
<i>where play was patronized...</i>

195
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,797  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... and professors of that science</i>
<i>always welcome.</i>

196
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,109  X1:293 X2:427 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>The seven.</i>

197
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,193  X1:235 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Why not the seven?</i>

198
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,188  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>All... all, yes.</i>

199
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,479  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>No more bets.</i>

200
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,548  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>Number seven...</i>

201
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,629  X1:311 X2:408 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>... loses.</i>

202
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,319  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Place your bets.</i>

203
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,989  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:509
Chevalier, will you give me credit
for 5,000 louis d'or, please?

204
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,519  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:507
Of course, Lord Ludd.

205
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,274  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>Five thousand.</i>

206
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,317  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Now, everything on the four.</i>

207
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,308  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Yes, I know, everything on the four.</i>

208
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,148  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>No more bets.</i>

209
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,348  X1:267 X2:453 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>The four loses.</i>

210
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,439  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>It is not important.</i>

211
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,715  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Now, I'm weary.</i>

212
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,433  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>I would like dinner. Shall we?</i>

213
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,872  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:507
Excuse me, Lord Ludd.

214
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,599  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:509
If you don't mind.

215
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,835  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:482 Y2:504
Not at all.

216
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,990  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>They always played on credit with</i>
<i>any person of honour or noble lineage.</i>

217
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,071  X1:106 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>They never pressed for their winnings...</i>

218
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,118  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... or declined to receive</i>
<i>promissory notes.</i>

219
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,791  X1:124 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>But woe to the man who did not pay</i>
<i>when the note became due.</i>

220
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,552  X1:149 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>Barry was sure to wait upon him</i>
<i>with his bill.</i>

221
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,838  X1:191 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>There were few bad debts.</i>

222
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,870  X1:313 X2:405 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>Saluez.</i>

223
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,115  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>It was Barry's skill with the sword,</i>
<i>and readiness to use it...</i>

224
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,597  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... that maintained the reputation</i>

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,115  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:504
Sir Charles.

264
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,078  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:509

00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,669  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:504
Pardon?

266
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,718  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:504
Come, sir. I'm a man who would rather
be known as a cuckold than a fool.

267
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,037  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:509
I think, Sir Charles,
that you've had too much to drink.

268
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,189  X1:318 X2:399 Y1:482 Y2:504
What?

269
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,076  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:509
As it happens, your Chaplain, Mr. Runt,
introduced me to your Lady...

270
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,595  X1:122 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:509
...to advise me on a religious matter,
of which she is an expert.

271
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,868  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:509
He wants... to step into my shoes.

272
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,873  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:509
He wants to step into my shoes.

273
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,590  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:509
Is it not a pleasure for me,
as I am drawing near the goal...

274
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,314  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:509
...to find my home such a happy one...

275
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,873  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:509
...my wife so fond of me, that she is even
now thinking of appointing a successor?

276
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,111  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:509
Isn't it a comfort to see her
like a prudent housewife...

277
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,714  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:509

278
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,592  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:504
I hope you're not thinking of leaving us,
Sir Charles?

279
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,076  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:509
Not so soon as you may fancy, perhaps.

280
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,749  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:509

281
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,759  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:504
And there was always
a candidate or two...

282
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,639  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:509

283
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,559  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:509
I'm sorry for you, Mr. Barry.

284
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,359  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:509
It grieves me to keep you

285
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,556  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:509
Had you not better arrange

286
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,150  X1:106 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:507

287
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,510  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:509
What are the odds, gentlemen,
that I live to see Mr. Barry hang yet?

288
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,552  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:509
Sir, let those laugh that win.

289
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,709  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:504

290
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,999  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:509

you seem particularly glum today?

334
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,557  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:509
You should be happy
that your mother has remarried.

335
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,954  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:482 Y2:509
Not in this way.

336
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,233  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:504
And not in such haste.

337
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,237  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:509
And certainly not to this man.

338
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,069  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:482 Y2:509
I think you judge your mother too harshly.

339
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,115  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:509
Do you not like your new father?

340
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,628  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:482 Y2:509
Not very much.

341
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,998  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:509
He seems to me little more
than a common opportunist.

342
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,475  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:509
I don't think he loves my mother at all.

343
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,830  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:504
And it hurts me to see her
make such a fool of herself.

344
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,753  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>At the end of a year Her Ladyship</i>
<i>presented Barry with a son.</i>

345
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,594  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Bryan Patrick Lyndon, they called him.</i>

346
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,998  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Her Ladyship and Barry lived,</i>
<i>after a while, pretty separate.</i>

347
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,357  X1:105 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>She preferred quiet, or to say the truth,</i>
<i>he preferred it for her...</i>

348
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,028  X1:140 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... being a great friend to a modest</i>
<i>and tranquil behaviour in woman.</i>

349
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,510  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Besides, she was a mother,</i>
<i>and would have great comfort...</i>

350
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,634  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... in the dressing, educating</i>
<i>and dandling of their little Bryan.</i>

351
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,393  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>For whose sake it was fit,</i>
<i>Barry believed...</i>

352
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,429  X1:106 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... that she should give up the pleasures</i>
<i>and frivolities of the world...</i>

353
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,876  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... leaving that part of the duty</i>
<i>of every family of distinction...</i>

354
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,191  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... to be performed by him.</i>

355
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,629  X1:123 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Lady Lyndon tended to a melancholy</i>
<i>and maudlin temper...</i>

356
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,794  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... and, left alone by her husband,</i>
<i>was rarely happy or in good humour.</i>

357
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,271  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Now she must add jealousy</i>
<i>to her other complaints...</i>

358
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,158  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... and find rivals even among her maids.</i>

359
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,075  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:507
Samuel, what would the time be?

360
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,629  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:509
Twenty-five minutes past eleven,
My Lady.

361
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,435  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:509
Shall we make this the last game, ladies?

362
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,913  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:509
Good morning, ladies.

363
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,950  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:509
Would you mind excusing us?
I'd like a word alone with Lady Lyndon.

364
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,915  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:482 Y2:509
I'm sorry.

365
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,553  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:504
This coat is made of the finest velvet...

366
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,839  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:504
...all cunningly worked
with silver thread.

367
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,199  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:509
No finer velvet has ever been woven,
and you will see none better anywhere.

368
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,679  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:509
Pardon me, gentlemen.

369
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,758  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:509
Good morning, dearest.

370
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,794  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:509
We're taking the children for a ride
to the village. We'll be back for tea.

371
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,075  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:509
Have a nice time. I'll see you then.

372
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,038  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:509
Goodbye, little Bryan.

373
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,719  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon.

374
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,831  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:509
Take good care of your mother.

375
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,834  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:509
Come now, give your father a proper kiss.

376
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,479  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon...

377
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,953  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:509
...is that the way to behave
to your father?

378
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,109  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon,
have you lost your tongue?

379
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,991  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:509
My father was Sir Charles Lyndon.
I have not forgotten him, if others have.

380
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,673  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon,
you have insulted your father!

381
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,635  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:509
Madam, you have insulted my father.

382
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,438  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:509
Dearest, would you excuse us?
We have something to discuss in private.

383
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,988  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:504
Gentlemen.

384
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,910  X1:330 X2:388 Y1:482 Y2:504
One.

385
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,110  X1:328 X2:390 Y1:482 Y2:504
Two.

386
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,915  X1:335 X2:383 Y1:482 Y2:504
Six.

387
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,199  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon...

388
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,756  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:509
...I have always been willing
to live with you on friendly terms.

389
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,031  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:509
But be clear about one thing:

390
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,311  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:507
As men serve me, I serve them.

391
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,474  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:504
I never laid a cane on the back
of a Lord before...

392
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,394  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:509
...but, if you force me to, I shall
speedily become used to the practice.

393
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,189  X1:092 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:509
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

394
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,196  X1:338 X2:380 Y1:482 Y2:504
No.

395
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,995  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:482 Y2:509
You may go.

396
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,118  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:507
<i>Barry believed, and not without</i>
<i>some reason, that it had been...</i>

397
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,148  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... a declaration of war against him</i>
<i>by Bullingdon from the start...</i>

398
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,480  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... and that the evil consequences</i>
<i>that ensued...</i>

399
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,949  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... were entirely of Bullingdon's creating.</i>

400
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,559  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:509
I shall make you into
a real magician now, Bryan.

401
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,359  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:509
I shall show you the knot that never was.

402
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,869  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>As Bullingdon grew up to be a man...</i>

403
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,958  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... his hatred for Barry</i>
<i>assumed an intensity...</i>

404
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,791  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... equalled only by his</i>
<i>increased devotion to his mother.</i>

405
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,031  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:509
Very good, Bryan. A little bow.

406
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,269  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:509
Put it on the table for me.
Thank you.

407
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:40,156  X1:125 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>For Bryan's eighth birthday the local</i>
<i>nobility, gentry and their children...</i>

408
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,632  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... came to pay their respects.</i>

409
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,757  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:509
The inside and outside are quite empty.

410
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,038  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:509
Wave your hand over the top.
Is there anything there?

411
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,117  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:504
Wonderful! Wonderful, colourful
silk handkerchiefs!

412
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,840  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:509
Take a bow, Bryan,
you did that beautifully.

413
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,115  X1:288 X2:428 Y1:482 Y2:509
Very good.

414
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,034  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:509
Let's see if you have something
behind your ear.

415
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,189  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, you have.

416
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,591  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:504
A little ball. Let's make it vanish.

417
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,556  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:482 Y2:509
It's gone.

418
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,108  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:509
Here it is, behind my elbow.

419
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,033  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:509
Wave your hand
over my green silk handkerchief...

420
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,874  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:509
...and see if we can produce
a magic flower. I wonder if we can?

421
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,948  X1:267 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:504
Here it comes.

422
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,072  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:504
The colours of the rainbow.

423
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,592  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:509
You know all the colours of the rainbow
produce but one colour, Bryan.

424
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,798  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:509
Nothing in my magic cabinet.

425
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,871  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:509
They produce the colour... white.

426
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,831  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:509
And there is my own...

427
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,828  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:504
...beautiful white rabbit.

428
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,673  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:504
Bryan, you have done very well.
A little bow.

429
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,350  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:509
We crept up on their fort,
and I jumped over the wall first.

430
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,278  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:509
My fellows jumped after me.

431
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,078  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:509
You should have seen the Frenchmen's
faces when 23 rampaging he-devils...

432
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,197  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:509
...sword and pistol, cut and thrust,
came tumbling into their fort.

433
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,637  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:509
In three minutes we left
as many Artillery men's heads...

434
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,472  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:504
...as there were cannon balls.

435
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,998  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:509
Later we were visited
by our noble Prince Henry.

436
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,230  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:509
''Who is the man who has done this? <i>''</i>
I stepped forward.

437
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,828  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:509
''How many heads was it
that you cut off? <i>''</i> He says.

438
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,593  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:509
''Nineteen,'' says I,
''besides wounding <i>several.''</i>

439
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,548  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:504
Well, I'll be blessed,
if he didn't burst into tears.

440
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,157  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:507
''Noble, noble <i>fellow,''</i> he said.

441
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,478  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:509
''Here is nineteen golden guineas,
one for each head that you cut <i>off.''</i>

442
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,798  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:509
What do you think of that?

443
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,075  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:509
Were you allowed to keep the heads?

444
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,593  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:509
No, they always become
the property of the King.

445
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,077  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:509
Will you tell me another story?

446
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,278  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:509
I'll tell you one tomorrow.

447
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,635  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:509
Will you play cards with me tomorrow?

448
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,276  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:509
Of course I will. Now go to sleep.

449
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,357  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:509
Will you keep the candles lit?

450
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,757  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:504
Bryan, big boys don't sleep
with the candles lit.

451
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,278  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:504
I'm afraid of the dark.

452
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,080  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:504
My darling, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

453
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,509  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:507
But, I like it with the candles lit.

454
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,473  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:504
All right, you can sleep
with the candles lit.

455
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,874  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:482 Y2:509
Thank you, Papa.

456
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,389  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:509
Good night.

457
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,909  X1:266 X2:448 Y1:482 Y2:507
Ah, Redmond!

458
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,755  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:509
It's a blessing to see my darling boy
has attained a position I knew was his due.

459
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,078  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:504
And for which I pinched myself
to educate him.

460
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,917  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:509
Little Bryan is a darling boy...

461
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,871  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and you live in great splendour.

462
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,750  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:448 Y2:504
Your lady wife knows
she has a treasure...

463
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,513  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:504
...she couldn't have had,
had she married a Duke.

464
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,231  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:509
But, if she should tire
of my wild Redmond...

465
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,190  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and his old-fashioned Irish ways...

466
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,518  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:504
...or if she should die...

467
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,676  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:509
...what future would there be
for my son, and my grandson?

468
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,511  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:509
You have not a penny of your own...

469
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,191  X1:132 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:509
...and cannot transact any business
without her signature.

470
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,435  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:509
Upon her death the entire estate
would go to young Bullingdon...

471
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,230  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:509
...who bears you little affection.

472
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,751  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:509
You could be penniless tomorrow...

473
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,828  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:509
...and darling Bryan at the mercy
of his stepbrother.

474
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,832  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:509
Shall I tell you something?

475
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,438  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:509
There is only one way for you
and your son to have real security.

476
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,914  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:504
You must obtain a title.

477
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,235  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:509
I shall not rest
until I see you Lord Lyndon.

478
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,236  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:509
You have important friends.

479
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,595  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:509
They can tell you
how these things are done.

480
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,116  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:509
For money, well-timed
and properly applied...

481
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,957  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:509
...can accomplish anything.

482
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,072  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>And Barry was acquainted with someone</i>
<i>who knew how these things were done.</i>

483
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,912  X1:128 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>This was the distinguished Barrister</i>
<i>and former Government Minister...</i>

484
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,588  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>... Lord Hallam...</i>

485
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,438  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... whose acquaintance he had made,</i>
<i>like so many others, at the gaming table.</i>

486
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,349  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:504
Do you happen to know
the Thirteenth Earl of Wendover?

487
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,319  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:504
I don't believe I do.

488
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,638  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:448 Y2:509
Well, this nobleman is one
of the Gentlemen of His Majesty's Closet...

489
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,877  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:509
...with whom our revered Monarch
is on terms of considerable intimacy.

490
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,029  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:509
In my opinion, you would be wise
to fix upon him...

491
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,519  X1:092 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:509
...your chief reliance for the advancement
of your claim to the peerage.

492
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,639  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:507
When I take up a person, Mr. Lyndon,
he, or she, is safe.

493
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,749  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:482 Y2:509
There is no question about them anymore.

494
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,551  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:509
My friends are the best people.
I don't mean they're the most virtuous...

495
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,631  X1:158 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:504
...or, indeed, the least virtuous,
or the cleverest...

496
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,559  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:448 Y2:504
...or the stupidest,
richest or best born.

497
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,349  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:482 Y2:507
But, the best.

498
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,950  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:509
In a word, people about whom
there is no question.

499
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,308  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:509
I cannot promise how long it will take.

500
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,673  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:509
You can appreciate
it is not an easy matter.

501
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,274  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:509
But, any gentleman with an estate,
and 30,000 a year...

502
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,678  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:509
...should have a peerage.

503
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,072  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:509
And there standing behind me
was a total stranger.

504
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,750  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:507
I looked at him, and he said to me:

505
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,870  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:504
''Excuse me, sir, could you tell me,
is Lord Wendover alive or dead? <i>''</i>

506
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,469  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:509
I was so astonished,
I couldn't think of what to say.

507
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,791  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:507
Then I became angry,
and said to him, ''He's <i>dead.''</i>

508
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,438  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>The striving after this peerage was</i>
<i>one of Barry's most unlucky dealings.</i>

509
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,000  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>He made great sacrifices</i>
<i>to bring it about.</i>

510
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,919  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>He lavished money here,</i>
<i>and diamonds there.</i>

511
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,908  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>He bought lands</i>
<i>at ten times their value...</i>

512
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,239  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... purchased pictures and articles</i>
<i>of virtue at ruinous prices.</i>

513
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,070  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>He gave entertainments</i>
<i>to those friends to his claim...</i>

514
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,355  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... all, being about the Royal person,</i>
<i>were likely to advance it.</i>

515
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,550  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>And, I can tell you, bribes were</i>
<i>administered. And in high places, too.</i>

516
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:14,351  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>So near the person of His Majesty</i>
<i>that you would be astonished to know...</i>

517
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,555  X1:115 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... what great noblemen condescended</i>
<i>to receive his loans.</i>

518
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,116  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:509
This is by Ludovico Cordi...

519
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,956  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:509
...a disciple of Alessandro Allori.

520
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,390  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:504
It's dated 1605...

521
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,670  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:509
...and shows,
''The Adoration of The <i>Magi.''</i>

522
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,514  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:504
It's beautiful.

523
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,510  X1:331 X2:386 Y1:482 Y2:504
Yes.

524
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,878  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:509
I love the use of the colour blue
by the artist.

525
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,191  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, that is very beautiful.

526
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,597  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:509
What is the price of this one?

527
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,550  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:509
Well, this is one of my best pictures.

528
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,472  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:509
But, if you really like it, I'm sure
we can come to some arrangement.

529
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,353  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:509
Lord Wendover, Your Majesty.

530
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,749  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:504
I'm glad to see you here today,
Lord Wendover.

531
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,717  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:509
What news of Lady Wendover?

532
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,718  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:509
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Lady Wendover is much better.

533
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,192  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:509
Good! Present my compliments to her.
Say we miss her company here.

534
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,636  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:509
And what of those excellent boys
of yours?

535
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,157  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:509
They're well. Charles has gone to sea
under Captain Geary on the Ramillies.

536
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,517  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:509
John has gone to Oxford to learn
how to preach and pray.

537
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,669  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:509
Good, good!

538
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,240  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:509
Your Majesty, may I present
Mr. Barry Lyndon.

539
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,951  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:509
Mr. Lyndon. We were very fond
of Sir Charles Lyndon.

540
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,713  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:509
And how is Lady Lyndon?

541
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,677  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:509
She's very well, Your Majesty.

542
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,676  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:509
Mr. Lyndon raised a company of troops
to fight in America against the rebels.

543
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,909  X1:081 X2:638 Y1:448 Y2:509
Good, Mr. Lyndon. Raise another company
and go with them, too.

544
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,238  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Barry was born clever enough</i>
<i>at gaining a fortune...</i>

545
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,556  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... but incapable of keeping one.</i>

546
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,039  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>For the qualities and energies</i>
<i>which lead a man to achieve the first...</i>

547
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,551  X1:123 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... are often the very cause of his ruin</i>
<i>in the latter case.</i>

548
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,034  X1:092 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Now he was burdened with</i>
<i>the harassing cares and responsibilities...</i>

549
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,877  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... which are the dismal adjuncts</i>
<i>of great rank and property.</i>

550
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,194  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>And his life now...</i>

551
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,477  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... seemed to consist mostly of drafts</i>
<i>of letters to lawyers and money-brokers...</i>

552
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,152  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... and endless correspondence...</i>

553
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,151  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>... with decorators and cooks.</i>

554
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,318  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:509
Gentlemen, I'm going to leave you for
a few minutes. Carry on with your work.

555
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,589  X1:306 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:507
Yes, sir.

556
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,755  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:482 Y2:509
Bully.

557
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,395  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:482 Y2:504
What does...

558
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,752  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:504
...''strenuous'' mean?

559
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,278  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:509
Bryan, I'm trying to work.

560
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,553  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:504
But what does it mean?

561
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,914  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:509
It means ''an effort requiring <i>strength.''</i>

562
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,237  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:509
What does ''quadrangle'' mean?

563
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,029  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:509
A quadrangle is a four-sided figure
like a square or a rectangle.

564
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,833  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:509
Now, please be quiet,
and let me get on with my work.

565
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,197  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:509
Bryan, please be quiet!

566
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,792  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:509
Have you seen my pencil?

567
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,268  X1:275 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:507
No, I haven't.

568
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,034  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:509
Bryan, please stop making so much noise.

569
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,714  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:482 Y2:509
That's my pencil.

570
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,755  X1:289 X2:430 Y1:482 Y2:507
No, it isn't.

571
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,398  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:509
It is. It's my pencil!

572
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,873  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:509
I've had this all morning.

573
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,154  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:482 Y2:509
It's my pencil!

574
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,112  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:509
Listen, will you be quiet!

575
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,428  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:482 Y2:509
It's my pencil!

576
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,678  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:509
I'll teach you a lesson.

577
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,270  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:509
What the devil's going on in here?

578
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,398  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:509
I told you never
to lay a hand on this child.

579
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,790  X1:330 X2:388 Y1:482 Y2:504
One.

580
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,115  X1:328 X2:390 Y1:482 Y2:504
Two.

581
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,155  X1:335 X2:383 Y1:482 Y2:504
Six.

582
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,995  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:509
Will that be all, Mr. Redmond Barry?

583
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,152  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:507
Yes, that will be all.

584
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,432  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:509
Well then, look you now.

585
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,631  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:509
From this moment, I will submit
to no further chastisement from you.

586
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,871  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:509
I will kill you, if you lay hands
on me ever again.

587
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,277  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:509
Is that clear to you, sir?

588
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,234  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:504
Get out of here!

589
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,311  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:509
Don't you think he fits my shoes
very well, Your Ladyship?

590
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,348  X1:283 X2:435 Y1:482 Y2:504
Dear child...

591
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,478  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:509
...what a pity it is I'm not dead,
for your sake.

592
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,514  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:509
The Lyndons would then have
a worthy representative...

593
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,952  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and enjoy all the benefits...

594
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,077  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:509
...of the illustrious blood
of the Barrys of Barryville.

595
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,834  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:509
Would they not...

596
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,393  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:509
...Mr. Redmond Barry?

597
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,550  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:509
From the way I love this child...

598
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,713  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:504
...you ought to know how
I would've loved his elder brother...

599
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,473  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:509
...had he proved worthy
of any mother's affection.

600
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:15,990  X1:306 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:504
Madam!

601
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,753  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:504
I have borne as long
as mortal could endure...

602
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:26,277  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:509
...the ill-treatment of the insolent Irish
upstart whom you've taken to your bed.

603
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,997  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:448 Y2:509
It is not only his lowly birth and the
brutality of his manners which disgust me.

604
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,716  X1:109 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:509
But the shameful nature of his conduct
toward Your Ladyship...

605
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,633  X1:148 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:504
...his brutal and ungentlemanlike
behaviour...

606
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,472  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:482 Y2:509
...his open infidelity...

607
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,719  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:509
...his shameless robberies and swindling
of my property, and yours.

608
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:51,231  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:507
And as I cannot personally chastise
this low-bred ruffian, and cannot bear...

609
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,316  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:509
...to witness his treatment of you...

610
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,318  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:509
...and loathe his company
as if it were the plague...

611
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,433  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:504
...I have decided to leave my home
and never return.

612
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,390  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:509
At least, during his detested life...

613
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,679  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:509
...or during my own.

614
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,072  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:509
Will anyone be joining
Your Lordship?

615
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,593  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:507
No, I shall be alone.

616
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,029  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:509
The roast beef's very good, My Lord.

617
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,316  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:509
Hello, Neville. How are you?

618
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,318  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:482 Y2:509
Ah, Barry. Hello.

619
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,228  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:509
I see you're alone.
Why don't you join me?

620
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,392  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:509
Oh, thank you, Barry,
you're very kind, but...

621
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,150  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:509
...I'm expecting someone to join me.

622
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,674  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:509
What a shame! Lady Lyndon and I
have missed your company lately.

623
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,435  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:509
Please give my respects to Lady Lyndon...

624
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,796  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:509
...and say I've been very busy of late
and not been able to go about much.

625
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:38,949  X1:317 X2:401 Y1:482 Y2:504
I shall.

626
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,790  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:509
The eighth of next month we're
having some guests over for cards...

627
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,718  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:509
...we'd love to have you
and Lady Wendover join us.

628
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,678  X1:168 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:509
I'll check my diary, but I think
I'm engaged on that evening.

629
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,192  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:509
I hope you're not engaged.
We'd love to see you again.

630
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,955  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:509
I'll write and say if I'm free or not.

631
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,070  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:509
I look forward to hearing from you.
It's nice to see you again.

632
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,315  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>If he had murdered Lord Bullingdon...</i>

633
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,958  X1:089 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... Barry could scarcely have been received</i>
<i>with more coldness and resentment...</i>

634
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,714  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... that now followed him</i>
<i>in town and country.</i>

635
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,792  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>His friends fell away from him.</i>

636
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,233  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>A legend arose of his cruelty</i>
<i>to his stepson.</i>

637
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,358  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Now all the bills came down</i>
<i>on him together.</i>

638
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:39,155  X1:125 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>All the bills he had been contracting</i>
<i>for the years of his marriage...</i>

639
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,232  X1:147 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... and which the creditors sent in</i>
<i>with a hasty unanimity.</i>

640
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,518  X1:186 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Their amount was frightful.</i>

641
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,039  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>Barry was now bound up in an</i>
<i>inextricable toil of bills and debts...</i>

642
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,079  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... of mortgages and insurances,</i>
<i>and all the evils attendant upon them.</i>

643
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,629  X1:119 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Lady Lyndon's income was hampered</i>
<i>almost irretrievably...</i>

644
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,798  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... to satisfy these claims.</i>

645
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,793  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:509
Do you think that's good?

646
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,074  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:482 Y2:504
Excellent.

647
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,868  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:504
Who's this?

648
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,958  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:509
It's a peacock on the wall.

649
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,108  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:482 Y2:509
What's it say?

650
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,396  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:509
I saw this bird yesterday.

651
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,555  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:482 Y2:504
Who's that?

652
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,838  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:504
Mama in her coach.

653
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,438  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:509
Is she going to London?

654
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,435  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:482 Y2:504
I don't know.

655
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,433  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Barry had his faults...</i>

656
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,433  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... but no man could say of him</i>
<i>that he was not a good and tender father.</i>

657
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,554  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>He loved his son with a blind partiality.</i>

658
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,199  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>He denied him nothing.</i>

659
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,270  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>It is impossible to convey</i>
<i>what high hopes he had for the boy...</i>

660
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,311  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... and how he indulged</i>
<i>in a thousand fond anticipations...</i>

661
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,673  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... as to his future success</i>
<i>and figure in the world.</i>

662
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:52,238  X1:106 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>But fate had determined that he should</i>
<i>leave none of his race behind him...</i>

663
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,311  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>... that he should finish his life...</i>

664
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,392  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... poor, lonely...</i>

665
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,434  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>... and childless.</i>

666
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:08,916  X1:325 X2:393 Y1:482 Y2:509
Papa.

667
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,395  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, Bryan?

668
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,278  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:509
Will you buy me a horse?

669
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,873  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:509
Buy you a horse?

670
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,269  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, Papa.

671
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,518  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:509
But you already have little Julia.

672
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,398  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:509
She's only a pony, I want a real horse.

673
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,670  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:509
Then I can ride with you on the hunt.

674
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,156  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:509
You think you're big enough for the hunt?

675
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,116  X1:306 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:509
Oh, yes!

676
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:30,591  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:509
Jonathan Plunkett is only a year older
than I am and he rides with his papa.

677
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,552  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:504
I'll have to think about it.

678
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:38,277  X1:106 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:504
Please, say yes. There's nothing I want
in the whole world more than a horse.

679
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,073  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:504
I'll think about it.

680
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,071  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:509
Oh, thank you, Papa. Thank you!

681
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,392  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:509
How much are you asking for him?

682
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,399  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:509
One hundred guineas.

683
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:55,477  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:504
He's a nice little horse,
but I don't think he's worth that.

684
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,634  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:509
Seventy-five seems
more like the right price.

685
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,312  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:509
I'll accept eighty guineas,
and not a shilling less.

686
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,675  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:509
Five guineas should never keep two
gentlemen from their drink. Eighty then.

687
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:09,795  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:482 Y2:507
Done, sir.

688
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,959  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:509
Take the horse to Doolan's farm.
Tell him he needs a bit of breaking in.

689
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,869  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:509
Say it's for Master Bryan's birthday,
and I want it to be a surprise.

690
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,712  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:509
And remember that yourself.

691
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,110  X1:325 X2:393 Y1:482 Y2:509
Papa.

692
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,359  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:507
What is it, lad?

693
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,158  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:509
Did you buy that horse?

694
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,198  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:504
What horse is that?

695
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,753  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:509
The horse you were going
to buy me for my birthday.

696
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,117  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:509
I know nothing about any horse.

697
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:26,310  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:509
But one of the stable boys told Nelly
you'd already bought it...

698
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,230  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:509
...and it was at Doolan's farm
where Mick the groom was breaking it in.

699
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,114  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:504
Is that true?

700
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,793  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:509
When is your birthday?

701
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,515  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:509
Next Tuesday.

702
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,319  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:504
Well, you'll have to wait till then
to find out.

703
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,194  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:509
Then, it's true! Oh, thank you, Papa.

704
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,515  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:507
Yes, Mama?

705
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,149  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:509
Promise me you won't ride that horse
except with your father.

706
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,078  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, Mama, I promise.

707
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,756  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:509
And I promise you a good flogging...

708
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,350  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:509
...if you even go to Doolan's farm
to see him before your birthday.

709
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:08,910  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, Papa.

710
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,910  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:504
You understand?

711
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,274  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, Papa.

712
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,715  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:509
You promise me?

713
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,319  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, Papa, I promise.

714
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,992  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:509
All right, eat your food.

715
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,715  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:509
I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Lyndon...

716
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,109  X1:178 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:509
...but I believe Master Bryan
has disobeyed you...

717
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,316  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and stolen away to Doolan's farm.

718
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,631  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:509
On going to his room this morning,
I found his bed empty.

719
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,713  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:509
One of the cooks saw him
cross the yard at daybreak.

720
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,358  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:509
Didn't you see him go?

721
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,432  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:509
He must have passed through my room
while I was asleep.

722
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:36,950  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:509
Oh, my God! What has happened here?

723
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,197  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:507
I noticed the lad riding
across the field, sir...

724
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:44,439  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... and having trouble with the horse,</i>
<i>which was playing up.</i>

725
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,353  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Suddenly the animal plunged and reared,</i>
<i>and the poor lad was thrown.</i>

726
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,635  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:509
Oh, Bryan, why did you disobey me?

727
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,759  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:509
I'm sorry, Papa.

728
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,238  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:509
You won't whip me, will you?

729
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,473  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:482 Y2:509
No, my darling.

730
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,874  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:509
I won't whip you.

731
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,039  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:509
Take my horse and ride like the Devil
for Doctor Broughton.

732
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,196  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:504
Tell him whatever he's doing
he must come at once. Understand?

733
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,232  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:504
<i>The doctors were called.</i>

734
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:35,074  X1:095 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>But what does a doctor avail in a contest</i>
<i>with the grim, invincible enemy?</i>

735
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,838  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Such as came could only confirm</i>
<i>the hopelessness of the poor child's case.</i>

736
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:45,434  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>He remained with his parents</i>
<i>for two days.</i>

737
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,036  X1:140 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>And a sad comfort it was to know</i>
<i>that he was in no pain.</i>

738
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,630  X1:325 X2:393 Y1:482 Y2:509
Papa.

739
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,152  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:509
Am I going to die?

740
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,993  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:509
No, my darling, you're not going to die.
You're going to get better.

741
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:23,473  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:509
But I can't feel anything,
except in my hands.

742
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,677  X1:148 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:509
Does that mean I'm already dead
in part of my body?

743
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,870  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:509
No, my darling, that's where
you were hurt by the horse.

744
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,596  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:509
But you're going to be all right.

745
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,630  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:509
Papa, if I die, will I go to heaven?

746
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,916  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:509
Of course you will, my darling...

747
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,431  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:509
...but you're not going to die.

748
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,878  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:509
Mama, give me your hand.

749
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,318  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:509
Papa, give me your hand.

750
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,510  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:509
Will you both promise me something?

751
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:34,990  X1:331 X2:386 Y1:482 Y2:504
Yes.

752
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,993  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:509
Promise me never to quarrel so.

753
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,558  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:504
But to love each other.

754
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,790  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:509
So that we may meet again, in heaven...

755
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,114  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:509
...where Bullingdon said
quarrelsome people will never go.

756
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,555  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:482 Y2:509
We promise.

757
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,998  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:504
Will you tell me the story
about the fort?

758
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,635  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:482 Y2:504
Of course.

759
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,232  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:509
We crept up on the fort.

760
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:24,357  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:509
I jumped over the wall first,
and my fellows jumped after me.

761
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,669  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:509
And you should have seen the look...

762
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:35,070  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:509
...on the Frenchmen's faces when
23 he-devils, sword and pistol...

763
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,398  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:509
...cut and thrust,
came tumbling into the fort.

764
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,559  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:504
In three minutes...

765
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,709  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:504
...we left...

766
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,956  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:504
'''I am the resurrection and the life,'
saith the Lord.

767
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:05,036  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:509
'''He that believeth in me,
though he were dead...

768
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,113  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:509
'''... yet shall he live.

769
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,879  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:504
'''And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me...

770
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,393  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:504
'''... shall never die.'

771
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,275  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>''I</i> know that my Redeemer liveth...

772
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:24,150  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:509
''... and that He shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth.

773
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,516  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:509
''And though after my skin
worms destroy this body...

774

and mine eyes shall behold...

776
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,793  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:504
''... and not another.

777

''We brought nothing into this world...

778
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,599  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:509
''... and it is certain
we can carry nothing out.

''The Lord gave,

''Blessed is the name of the <i>Lord.''</i>

781
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,395  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>Barry's grief was inconsolable.</i>

782
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,031  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Such solace as he could find,</i>
<i>came only from drink.</i>

783
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,797  X1:079 X2:643 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>His mother was the only person who would</i>
<i>remain faithful to him in his misfortune.</i>

784
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:00,710  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>And many a night, when he was</i>
<i>unconscious of her attention...</i>

785
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,997  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:504

799
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,312  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:507
You wish to see me, madam?

800
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,756  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:507
Yes, Reverend. Please sit down.

801
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:36,473  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:507
I have some matters I would like
to discuss later, Graham...

802
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,596  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:509
...but just now would you go
to Her Ladyship...

803
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,511  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and have her sign these papers.

804
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,549  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:482 Y2:507
Yes, madam.

805
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,239  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:504
Reverend Runt...

806
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,630  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:509
...I need not tell you
that the recent tragedy to this family...

807
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:04,508  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:509
...has made the services of a tutor
no longer required here.

808
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:09,511  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:509
And as we are in considerable difficulty
about money...

809
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:13,550  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:509
...I'm afraid I must ask you,
with the greatest reluctance...

810
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,998  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:509
...to resign your post.

811
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,797  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:509
Madam, I'm sensible
to your predicament...

812
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,277  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:509
...and you need have no concern about
my wages, I can willingly forego them...

813
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:35,678  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:509
...but it is out of the question for me
to leave Her Ladyship in her present state.

814
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,111  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:509
I'm sorry to say this to you...

815
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:46,237  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:509
...but I believe you are largely responsible
for her present state of mind.

816
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:50,713  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:504
The sooner you leave,
the better she will be.

817
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,155  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:509
Madam, with the greatest respect...

818
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,393  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:509
...I take my instructions
only from Her Ladyship.

819
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,399  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:504
Reverend Runt...

820
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,868  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:509
...Her Ladyship is in no fit mind
to give instructions to anyone.

821
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,870  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:504
My son has charged me with managing
the affairs at Castle Hackton...

822
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:19,078  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:509
...until he recovers from his grief and
resumes his interest in worldly matters.

823
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,393  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:509
While I'm in charge...

824
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,278  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:509
...you'll take your instructions from me.

825
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,350  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:509
My only concern is for Lady Lyndon.

826
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,475  X1:299 X2:418 Y1:482 Y2:504
Madam...

827
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:36,152  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:509
...your only concern is
for Her Ladyship's signature.

828
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:41,631  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:509
You and your son have almost succeeded
in destroying a fine family fortune.

829
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,592  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:509
And what little remains for you...

830
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,672  X1:132 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:509
...depends on keeping Her Ladyship
prisoner in her own home.

831
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,479  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:504
Reverend Runt...

832
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,114  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:504
...this matter bears
no further discussion.

833
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,354  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:509
You will pack your bags
and leave by tomorrow.

834
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,595  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:509
God, help. Help!

835
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,794  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>In the midst of these great perplexities...</i>

836
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:27,430  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... Her Ladyship made an attempt</i>
<i>to kill herself by taking poison.</i>

837
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,319  X1:169 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Though she only made herself</i>
<i>dangerously ill...</i>

838
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,754  X1:158 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... due to the very small amount</i>
<i>which she swallowed...</i>

839
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,748  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>... this, nevertheless, caused</i>
<i>an intervention from a certain quarter...</i>

840
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,878  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... which was long overdue.</i>

841
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:41,995  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:509
Oh, my God!

842
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,952  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:509
If my mother had died...

843
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,190  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:509
...it would've been as much
my responsibility...

844
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,714  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:509
...as if I had poured
the strychnine for her myself.

845
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:25,518  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:509
For to the everlasting disgrace
of my family name...

846
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,632  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:509
...I have, by my cowardice,
and by my weakness...

847
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,359  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:504
...allowed the Barrys
to establish a brutal...

848
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,035  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and ignorant tyranny over our lives...

849
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,875  X1:183 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:504
...which has left my mother
a broken woman...

850
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:44,357  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:509
...and to squander and ruin
a fine family fortune.

851
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,388  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:509
My friends profess sympathy,
but behind my back...

852
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,113  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:509
...I know I am despised.

853
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,391  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:509
And quite justifiably so.

854
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,555  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:482 Y2:504
However...

855
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,117  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:504
...I know now what I must do.

856
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,399  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:504
And what I shall do.

857
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,193  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:504
Whatever be the cost.

858
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,478  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:509
Good morning, My Lord.

859
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,029  X1:263 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:509
Good morning.

860
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,433  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:509
Is Mr. Barry Lyndon here?

861
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,238  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, My Lord, he's inside.

862
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,393  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:509
Mr. Redmond Barry.

863
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,230  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:504
The last occasion on which we met...

864
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,753  X1:147 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:504
...you wantonly caused me injury
and dishonour.

865
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:31,990  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:509
In such a manner, and to such an extent
no gentleman can willingly suffer...

866
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,756  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:509
...without demanding satisfaction...

867
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,711  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:504
...however much time intervenes.

868
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,077  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:504
I have now come to claim
that satisfaction.

869
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,275  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:509
Mr. Lyndon...

870
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,233  X1:120 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:509
...these are a matched pair of pistols,
and as you have seen...

871
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,831  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:504
...your second has loaded one,
and I have loaded the other.

872
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:41,358  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:509
As they belong to Lord Bullingdon,
you may have whichever one you wish.

873
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,479  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon.

874
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,709  X1:163 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:504
Now, gentlemen, to determine
who will have first fire...

875
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,071  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:504
...I will toss a coin in the air.

876
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:08,068  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:509
As the offended party, it is
Lord Bullingdon's choice to call the toss.

877
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,350  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:509
Is that agreeable to both of you?

878
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,595  X1:331 X2:386 Y1:482 Y2:504
Yes.

879
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,509  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:504
If Lord Bullingdon calls correctly
he will have the first fire.

880
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:25,555  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:504
If incorrectly, Mr. Lyndon
will have the first fire.

881
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,072  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:509
Is that clearly understood?

882
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,830  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:509
What is your call, Lord Bullingdon?

883
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:41,315  X1:317 X2:402 Y1:482 Y2:504
Heads.

884
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,749  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:482 Y2:504
It is heads.

885
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,755  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon will have the first fire.

886
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,433  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon...

887
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,837  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:509
...will you take your ground?

888
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,395  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:504
One... two... three...

889
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,277  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:504
...four... five... six...

890
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,598  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:509
...seven... eight... nine... ten.

891
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,393  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:509
Mr. Lyndon, will you take your ground?

892
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:56,878  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:509
Mr. Lyndon, are you ready to receive
Lord Bullingdon's fire?

893
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:08,915  X1:331 X2:386 Y1:482 Y2:504
Yes.

894
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:13,959  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon...

895
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,873  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:509
...cock your pistol...

896
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,152  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and prepare to fire.

897
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,795  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:509
Sir Richard, this pistol must be faulty.

898
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,438  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:504
I must have another one.

899
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,636  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:509
I'm sorry, Lord Bullingdon,
but you must first stand your ground...

900
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:45,075  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and allow Mr. Lyndon his turn to fire.

901
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:50,316  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:509
That is correct, Lord Bullingdon.

902
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:54,994  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:509
Your pistol has fired,
and that counts as your shot.

903
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,588  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:509
Mr. Lyndon, are the rules of firing
clear to you?

904
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,390  X1:331 X2:386 Y1:482 Y2:504
Yes.

905
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,519  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon...

906
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,520  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:509
...are you ready to receive
Mr. Lyndon's fire?

907
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,030  X1:331 X2:386 Y1:482 Y2:504
Yes.

908
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:36,639  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:482 Y2:509
Very well, then.

909
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,148  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:509
Mr. Lyndon...

910
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,993  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:509
...cock your pistol...

911
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,478  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and prepare to fire.

912
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:44,033  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:509
Are you ready, Lord Bullingdon?

913
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,310  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:509
Is your pistol cocked, Mr. Lyndon?

914
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,230  X1:331 X2:386 Y1:482 Y2:504
Yes.

915
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,753  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:509
Then prepare to fire.

916
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,229  X1:322 X2:396 Y1:482 Y2:504
One...

917
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:15,989  X1:307 X2:411 Y1:484 Y2:504
...two...

918
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:32,072  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon, in view of Mr. Lyndon
having fired into the ground...

919
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,671  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:509
...do you now consider
that you have received satisfaction?

920
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,514  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:504
I have not received satisfaction.

921
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,191  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:509
Mr. Lyndon, are you ready?

922
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,190  X1:331 X2:386 Y1:482 Y2:504
Yes.

923
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,039  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon...

924
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,315  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:509
...cock your pistol
and get ready to fire.

925
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:02,229  X1:322 X2:396 Y1:482 Y2:504
One...

926
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:05,995  X1:307 X2:411 Y1:484 Y2:504
...two...

927
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:29,433  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>Barry was carried to an inn nearby</i>
<i>and a surgeon was called.</i>

928
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,399  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:509
I'm nearly finished.

929
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:08,513  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:509
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Mr. Lyndon.

930
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,915  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:509
I'm afraid you'll have to lose the leg...

931
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,472  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:509
...most likely below the knee.

932
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,268  X1:275 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:509
Lose the leg?

933
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,875  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:482 Y2:504
What for?

934
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,429  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:509
The simple answer is to save your life.

935
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,759  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:509
The ball has shattered the bone
below the knee and severed the artery.

936
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,032  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:509
Unless I amputate, there's no way
that I can repair the artery...

937
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:42,792  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and stop the hemorrhage.

938
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,355  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:482 Y2:504
Graham.

939
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,709  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, My Lord?

940
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:20,557  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:509
When we arrive at Castle Hackton,
inform Mrs. Barry of what has happened.

941
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,590  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:509
Don't go into any unnecessary detail.

942
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,668  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:509
Just tell her where he is
and that he has been wounded in the leg.

943
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,198  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:509
She will want to go to him.

944
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,793  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:448 Y2:509
See that she is out of the house and
on her way to London as soon as possible.

945
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,075  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:504
And in no event...

946
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,674  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:509
...is she to be allowed to see my mother...

947
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:42,071  X1:099 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:504
...or create any disturbance at the house
before she leaves.

948
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,949  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, My Lord.

949
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,437  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:509
Mrs. Barry, how do you do?

950
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,436  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:504
How nice to see you, Graham.
Come in.

951
01:40:58,520 --> 01:40:59,555  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:482 Y2:509
Thank you.

952
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:03,515  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:509
You... received my note?

953
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,713  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:509
Yes, we were expecting you.

954
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,439  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:504
Oh, good, I didn't want
to call unannounced.

955
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:11,591  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:509
Mr. Lyndon, how are you feeling?

956
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,080  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:509
I'm feeling much better,
thank you, Graham.

957
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,554  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:482 Y2:509
Won't you sit down?

958
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,153  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:509
Thank you, Mrs. Barry.

959
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,952  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:509
Would you like some tea?

960
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:33,117  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:509
Oh, no! No, thank you, Mrs. Barry.
Not just now.

961
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,676  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:509
How's the world treating you, Graham?

962
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:42,318  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:507
Oh, not too bad.

963
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,271  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:509
Are you comfortable here?

964
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,634  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:504
Most comfortable.

965
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:49,994  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:509
Good, good!

966
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,228  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:509
Shall we get down to the matter at hand?

967
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,269  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:509
By all means.

968
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,755  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:509
Mr. Lyndon...

969
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:22,359  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:509
...Lord Bullingdon has instructed me...

970
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:26,118  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:509
...to offer you an annuity...

971
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:30,589  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:509
...of 500 guineas a year for life.

972
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:35,912  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:509
Specifically on the condition of your...

973
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,358  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:509
...leaving England...

974
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:42,520  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and to be stopped...

975
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,716  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:509
...the instant of your return.

976
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:52,593  X1:136 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:509
Lord Bullingdon has also asked me
to point out to you...

977
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,714  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:509
...that should you decide to remain here...

978
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:00,995  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:482 Y2:509
...your stay would infallibly plunge you...

979
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,437  X1:295 X2:423 Y1:482 Y2:509
...into jail.

980
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:10,511  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:504
As in view of the present circumstances
there will soon be...

981
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:14,517  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:509
...innumerable writs taken out
against you for...

982
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,996  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:509
...debts long-outstanding...

983
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,760  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:509
...and your credit is so blown that...

984
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:23,792  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:509
...you could not hope...

985
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,958  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:509
...to raise a shilling.

986
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,396  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:509

987
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:01,993  X1:158 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>... what was the lonely</i>
<i>and broken-hearted man to do?</i>

988
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:07,475  X1:146 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:504
<i>He took the annuity and returned</i>
<i>to Ireland with his mother...</i>

989
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:09,394  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:509
<i>... to complete his recovery.</i>

990
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:13,549  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:504

991
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,229  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>His life there, we have not the means</i>

992
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:23,510  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:509
<i>He appears to have resumed</i>

993
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:25,517  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:504

994
