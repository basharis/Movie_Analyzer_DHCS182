1
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,755
I'm tired of this constant nagging.

2
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,201
It's like you're turning
into one of your sisters.

3
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,951
And I'm tired of your drinking
and feeling sorry for yourself.

4
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,515
Feeling sorry for myself?

5
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,315
# I'll be the mechanic of your heart... #

6
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,920
Half the bloody country is out of work.

7
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,074
- You're not that special.
- Oh, let me out of here.

8
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,591
# And with a wrench,
I'll take you apart... #

9
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,993
- It's my bloody house.
- Your bloody house? Brilliant.

10
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,351
I've been paying the mortgage
on it for the last 15 years.

11
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,161
If we didn't share a mortgage,
I would leave you.

12
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,477
# If we didn't share a mortgage #

13
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,831
# I would leave you... #

14
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,640
- I've had enough of it.
- Go on and leave any time you like.

15
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,321
# Go on and leave any time you like... #

16
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,159
Go on then, you stupid bitch.

17
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,750
# You stupid bitch... #

18
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,599
Though there are still no accurate figures

19
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,872
for the number of young
Irish people coming to London

20
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,395
in search of work, the crude indications
that do exist show an enormous increase.

21
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,478
Many take the boat
with barely enough money

22
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,799
to survive a few days in
London, but still they emigrate

23
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,360
because they see hope across the sea,
hope they cannot see in Ireland.

24
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,397
This meeting has been called to order.

25
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,319
Pray proceed.

26
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,354
Well, as some of you may have noticed,

27
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,281
your mother and I really are under
a lot of pressure at the moment.

28
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,880
Like the rest of the country.

29
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,674
I haven't had a single
commission this year.

30
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,792
Your mother is down to a three-day week.

31
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,237
It doesn't look like it's going
to get much brighter.

32
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,034
So we had a look at our accounts,

33
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,835
and... well, we-we see we
could make a significant saving

34
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,920
if we altered the education situation.

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,759
What education situation?

36
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,520
- Well...
- She means your school.

37
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,195
They're taking you out of school.

38
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,675
- What?
- No, no.

39
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,280
We're not taking you out of school.

40
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,597
We're transferring you from one school

41
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,553
- to another school.
- Why?

42
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,832
Because we need to make some
cuts in the budget somewhere.

43
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,600
I'd suggest taking
your brother out of college,

44
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,360
but he's already dropped out
of his own volition.

45
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,710
Thank you, Robert.

46
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,880
The Christian Brothers have
a fine history of education.

47
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,276
Who are the Christian Brothers?

48
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,994
The Christian Brothers
are an educational institution

49
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,720
- formed by...
- The Christian Brothers, Conor,

50
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,201
are an order of the Catholic Church
self-appointed in their education formation

51
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,836
and systematic beating
of their young charges.

52
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,156
Oh, shut up, Brendan.

53
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,040
Six years in the hands of the Jesuits,
and look what they did for you.

54
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,357
You're just gonna have
to face up to this, Conor.

55
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,995
Do you know what the
Christian Brothers' motto is?

56
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,191
"Viriliter Age."

57
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,721
Do you know what that means?

58
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,831
"Let's rape our students"?

59
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,554
No, Brendan, it doesn't.

60
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,321
It means "act manly."

61
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,879
What are you doing?
Get out of the bleedin' way.

62
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,512
Morning, Brother Baxter.

63
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,080
Sit down.

64
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,716
- French, Brother Barnabas.
- Huh?

65
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,639
You're teaching French, not Latin.

66
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,400
Oh, how modern.

67
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,950
Mind you, I'd be surprised
if any of you knew where France is,

68
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,357
not to mind speaking the language.

69
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,596
Oh, go on.

70
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,236
It's on the continent.

71
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,318
Above Spain.

72
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,912
You'll be the new lad, then,
from the Jesuits.

73
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,472
What's your name?

74
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,836
Conor Lawlor.

75
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,191
- Conor Lawlor?
- Shut up!

76
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,881
Right, Conor. Morning prayers
are at quarter to 9:00.

77
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,152
The canteen is located
just below the PE hall.

78
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,841
They serve chips and bars.

79
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,430
We have a strict black-shoe
policy here, Mr. Lawlor.

80
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,798
Your parents should have read it in
the introductory rule book, page 142.

81
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,112
I don't have black shoes, sir.

82
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,439
Well, you're just going to have
to get a pair then, aren't you?

83
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,837
And report to me first thing
in the morning with them.

84
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,560
Good man.

85
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,910
Brother.

86
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,112
As you were.

87
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,551
Sorry.

88
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,480
Where did he say the restaurant was again?

89
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,080
Do you mean the canteen?

90
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,680
Of course, the can-canteen, yeah.

91
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,394
"The restaurant."

92
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,314
You're not in France now,
you bleedin' spanner.

93
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,040
Do you smoke?

94
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,039
- Do you?
- Occasionally.

95
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,794
I'm not really a smoker.

96
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,155
My brother is. Uh, sometimes steal a bit
of his tobacco when my friends are over.

97
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,477
So do you want to have a smoke then or...?

98
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,116
- Here?
- Come on, we'll have a smoke. Follow me.

99
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,914
Come on.

100
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,395
Here, do you want one?

101
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,716
Nah, I'm okay.

102
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,599
I already had two this morning.

103
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,514
Actually, look at this yoke.

104
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,792
It's a Black Widow.

105
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,991
Savage.

106
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,036
- Now, I hear you're a queer.
- What?

107
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,675
Yeah, I hear you're a little queer.

108
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,997
No, you must have me mixed up
with someone else.

109
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,714
Nah, I don't think so.

110
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,673
Dance.

111
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,394
- Dance?
- Dance!

112
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,955
Dance, like a little queer, go.

113
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,071
Are you joking?

114
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,521
Jig.

115
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,314
Move it.

116
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,955
No, more arms.

117
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,681
Uh, yeah, disco, kind of.

118
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,713
Now dance with your pants down.

119
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,877
What?

120
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,277
Hmm. Get into that cubicle,
dance with your pants down.

121
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,801
No.

122
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,321
What did you just say?

123
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,639
Uh, I'm not, I'm not doing that.

124
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,199
It's Thursday.

125
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,800
It's 7:00.

126
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,038
It's Top of the Pops.

127
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,235
Conor, Brendan, come on, it's 7:00!

128
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,480
They can't be here tonight,
as they are in the USA,

129
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,072
so instead we have to go to Rio.

130
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,033
It's Duran Duran.

131
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,800
Hey, we're working here.

132
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,271
So are we.

133
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,880
This is my homework, Brendan.

134
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,594
I have a really important essay
due in the morning.

135
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,358
Just because you've given up on your
dreams doesn't mean we have to, all right?

136
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,960
Can we put the fire on?

137
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,799
No.

138
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,595
You're gonna love this, man.

139
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,553
Yes! Beautiful.

140
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,196
The jury's still out
on which way these guys'll go,

141
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,352
but they're a lot of fun, and John Taylor

142
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,919
is one of the most proficient bass players
in the UK at the moment.

143
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,477
Gives them a really funky edge,
which I hope they're gonna go for.

144
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,195
Hey, it's not exactly the Beatles, is it?

145
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,835
Oh, you know, will you go
outside and start up

146
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,640
the time machine there
so we can all go back in time

147
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,593
- for Dad, Conor.
- Well, if this is the future,

148
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,281
we're all screwed, aren't we?
I mean, look at this guy.

149
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,960
He's not even singing live.

150
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,356
It's a video, Robert.

151
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,995
It's art.

152
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,317
Everybody's making them
these days. Look at it.

153
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,917
He's very attractive, though, isn't he?

154
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,031
You're welcome to him.

155
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,311
Promise?

156
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,154
Who's that guitarist?

157
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,357
John Taylor.

158
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,551
All the girls love him.

159
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,434
Cute, isn't he, Ann?

160
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,631
And he's not a guitarist.

161
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,356
- He's a bassist.
- Yeah, Ann.

162
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,199
I mean, why can't they
get them to play live?

163
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,675
What are they trying to hide?

164
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,076
It's because they're in the USA.

165
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,112
Did you not hear him?

166
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,073
And this lasts forever.

167
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,956
It's the perfect mixture
of music and visuals.

168
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,834
It's short, to the point.

169
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,281
Look at it.

170
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,833
I mean, what tyranny
could stand up to that?

171
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,439
Good morning, Mr. Lawlor.

172
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,192
Well, I brought it up
with my mum, but she said

173
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,473
we can't afford another pair
at the moment.

174
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,200
I bought these before I knew
about the shoe color policy

175
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,711
here at Synge Street.

176
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,521
But it's not as if
they're runners or something.

177
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,995
They're... they're brown.

178
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,397
They're-they're quite sensible.

179
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,956
They're not black.

180
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,279
I'm-I'm not sure what you want me to do.

181
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,040
Take them off.

182
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,278
You can leave them at the door there.

183
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,001
Seeing as you're so fond of them, you
can pick them up here at 4:00 every day

184
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,590
until you comply with the rules
of the school.

185
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,519
What?

186
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,439
See you.

187
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,312
Could I have a Mars bar, please?

188
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,040
25p.

189
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,471
Thank you.

190
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,554
Here.

191
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,040
Ooh!

192
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,920
You should've just danced.

193
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,470
Who is that psycho?

194
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,115
That's Barry Bray.

195
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,961
- He'll be out for your blood for the year.
- Why?

196
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,913
'Cause you've shown signs of weakness.

197
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,794
So how do you know him?

198
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,639
He lives in the same flat as me.

199
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,434
His ma and da are drugs addicts.

200
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,961
But don't worry.

201
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,238
You just need to come up
with a plan for the year.

202
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,556
A solution.

203
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,480
Here.

204
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,558
Check it out.

205
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,355
"Darren Mulvey Business Solutions."

206
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,801
Call me anytime.

207
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,957
There's no number on it.

208
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,276
Oh, no, we don't have a phone.

209
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,755
Just call around, yeah?

210
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,396
Who's she?

211
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,841
I don't know.

212
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,475
She's always there.

213
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,314
She's beautiful.

214
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,591
Yeah, good luck.

215
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,200
She doesn't speak to anyone.

216
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,641
Stuck-up cow.

217
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,434
She said her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

218
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,234
She's not interested
in any of the boys in school.

219
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,553
Then why is she standing
over there every morning, then?

220
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,235
Need a light?

221
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,039
No. I'm trying to give up.

222
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,312
I don't have any matches anyway.

223
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,079
So, how come you're not in school?

224
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,794
I don't go to school.

225
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,071
I'm a model.

226
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,079
Cool, like, for magazines?

227
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,999
I'm going to London soon.

228
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,033
Just waiting for my portfolio shots.

229
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,994
There's no real work
for models in Dublin, you know?

230
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,671
Yeah, tell me about it.

231
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,316
Do you want to be in a video?

232
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,670
It's for my band.

233
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,599
You're in a band?

234
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,316
Yes, and we need a girl for it.

235
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,273
Have you ever been in a video before?

236
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,471
No.

237
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,752
Is that a problem?

238
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,156
I hope not.

239
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,396
I'll ask the producer.

240
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,716
Who's the producer?

241
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,719
That kid behind me.

242
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,154
I could call you with the details,
if I had your digits.

243
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,192
So, if you're in a band, sing me a song.

244
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,591
I can't sing out here.

245
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,031
You're gonna have to sing for,
like, thousands of people.

246
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,521
I'm just one.

247
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,597
Sing.

248
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,439
Don't make me sing.

249
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,518
Jesus.

250
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,870
Sing that song off the radio.

251
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,316
You know, the one by A-ha.

252
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,353
Sing it.

253
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,518
Sing it.

254
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,280
# Take... # Sorry.

255
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,471
# Take... #

256
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,591
No, it's too low.

257
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,392
# Take on me #

258
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:36,313
# Take me on. #

259
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,199
That's all I know.

260
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,674
Cool, bye.

261
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,831
- We need to form a band.
- What?

262
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,321
How are you, Darren?

263
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,875
- Is Eamon there?
- Eamon?

264
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,471
Hey, Eamon.

265
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,677
What are you doing?

266
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,916
Nothing really.

267
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,395
Just feeding me new bunny.

268
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,121
Conor, this is Eamon.
Eamon, this is Conor.

269
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,834
Conor's new in school, and
he's putting a band together.

270
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,681
Oh, good Jesus.

271
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,599
So?

272
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,390
Wow.

273
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,796
Where'd you get all this gear?

274
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,594
Me da's in a covers band.

275
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,917
Weddings, parties, pubs.

276
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,595
Eamon can play every instrument
known to mankind.

277
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,314
Can't you, Eamon?

278
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,034
Probably.

279
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,481
Show him.

280
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,951
Check it.

281
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,396
So what do you think...

282
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,512
So, what do you play yourself?

283
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,830
I'm more of a singer.

284
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,800
I write songs, words, lyrics.

285
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,157
But I haven't put them to music yet.

286
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,556
What kind of music
are yous gonna be doing?

287
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,434
Well, I-I don't know yet.

288
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,951
What d'you mean you don't know? You have
to know what you're gonna be playing.

289
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,560
What are you into?

290
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,996
I'm a futurist.

291
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,874
What does that mean?

292
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,992
Like, uh, no nostalgia.

293
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,874
Not like your da's band.

294
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,799
Not looking backwards, just forwards.

295
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,117
Oh, cool. Like Depeche Mode?

296
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,517
- Okay.
- Or Joy Division?

297
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,473
Right.

298
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,955
Or Duran Duran?

299
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,913
What do you think of them?

300
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,034
Jury is out on which way those guys'll go.

301
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,554
They're a lot of fun, and James Taylor is
one of the most proficient bass players

302
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,992
in the UK at the moment,
giving them a funky edge.

303
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,671
John Taylor.

304
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,798
Yeah, John. Of course.

305
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,201
I'll be in your band.

306
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,516
I'll play guitar.

307
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,399
And I'll help write songs.

308
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,038
We could rehearse here
'cause my da's in Saint John of Gods.

309
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,754
- Is that a pub?
- No, Darren.

310
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,111
It's a place where alcoholics
go to get off the drink,

311
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,039
stop beating up their wives and kids.

312
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,436
Right.

313
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,075
And neighbors.

314
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,840
Who's gonna be the manager?

315
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,759
Me.

316
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,315
Have you managed bands before?

317
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,034
No, I'm just breaking into the market.

318
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,316
Got to get everything straight.

319
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,875
Get everything down on paper first.

320
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,511
Otherwise, the major record labels
can rip you off when they come hunting.

321
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,280
That's what me da says.

322
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,516
When'd you want to rehearse?

323
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,439
Not at the weekends.

324
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,314
He's got a job packing shelves
in Quinnsworth on Saturdays.

325
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,955
You're not giving that up
for any band, d'you hear me?

326
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,481
Yeah.

327
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,479
What about Mondays
and Wednesdays after school?

328
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,870
That's fine.

329
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,879
Sounds good.

330
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,435
Now all we need is other musicians.

331
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,716
Do yous know any?

332
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,559
- No.
- Eamon?

333
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,195
He usually just plays on his own.

334
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,277
Don't you, love?

335
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,036
Right, well,
we can't get any peace in here.

336
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,517
Let's continue this meeting outside.

337
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,195
No smoking now.

338
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,312
Ma, how many times do I have to tell you?

339
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,716
I don't smoke.

340
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,076
There's a black guy in 3B.

341
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,601
So?

342
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,633
- Be cool if he was in the band.
- Why?

343
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,479
He's probably the one black guy
in the whole school.

344
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,240
Probably in Dublin.

345
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,273
Having a golliwog in the band
give us a real edge.

346
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,471
You can't say "golliwog."

347
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,796
Why not?

348
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,321
Trust me, you just can't.

349
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,080
And anyway,
what if he can't play anything?

350
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,318
He'll be able
to play something; he's black.

351
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,073
- Wow.
- Can I help you?

352
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,278
Is this the house
where the colored lad lives?

353
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,471
Four doors down.

354
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,001
What do you think?

355
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,880
How many black people do you think
that lives on this shitty estate?

356
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,078
- Do you know Ngig?
- What's that?

357
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,477
Ngig. My son.

358
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,957
We're putting a band together.
Does he play any instruments?

359
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,913
Why don't you ask him yourself?

360
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,351
We are putting

361
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,236
a band together.

362
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,001
I am the manager.

363
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,874
What the hell is wrong with him?

364
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,552
Oh, you, um,
sound different from your mam.

365
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,115
Course I do; been here
half me bleedin' life.

366
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,391
What'd you think?

367
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,558
Would you have any interest
in playing in a band?

368
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,160
What kind of music are yous playing?

369
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,994
We're not a hundred percent sure yet,
but do you play any instruments?

370
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,031
Maybe.

371
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,751
"Futurist band forming.

372
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,634
Looking for a bass player, drummer."

373
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,911
That's us.

374
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,321
"Influences include Depeche Mode,
Duran Duran and many more."

375
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,239
- Faggots.
- Piss off, Ryan.

376
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,275
"Contact Management Solutions,
361 at St. Theresa's Gardens.

377
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,630
No telephone, just call in."

378
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,474
Sounds like a gig for us.

379
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,796
Let's go.

380
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,398
So what are we called, then?

381
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,154
All right, what about...

382
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,601
The Rabbits?

383
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,553
What's the story with you and rabbits?

384
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,479
I don't know, I just love them.

385
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,672
What about La Vie?

386
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,076
What's that mean?

387
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,840
It's French for "The Life."

388
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,471
What's French for, uh, "That's not
gonna be the name of the band"?

389
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,718
C'est nes pas le nom du groupe.

390
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,752
There you go.

391
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,350
What about... Sing Street?

392
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,711
Do you actually not get that like?

393
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,195
Sing Street.

394
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,641
- Oh!
- I like that.

395
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,037
- Gobshites.
- Yeah, I like it.

396
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,677
# Moving on the floor now, babe #

397
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:18,352
# You're a bird of paradise #

398
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,314
# Cherry ice-cream smile #

399
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,037
# I suppose it's very nice #

400
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,317
# Her name is Rio #

401
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:36,152
# And she dances on the sand #

402
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,840
# Just like that river #

403
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,511
# Twisting through a dusty land #

404
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,800
# And when she smiles #

405
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,552
# She really shows you all she can #

406
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,559
# Oh, Rio, Rio #

407
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,356
# Dance across the Rio Grande. #

408
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,273
- Sped up a bit there at the end.
- Really?

409
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,791
- That sounded great.
- Yeah, we sound deadly.

410
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,277
Oh, lads, we're gonna be amazing.

411
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,954
What are you doing?

412
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,754
I'm just letting
the stink of that out, man.

413
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,031
Whew.

414
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,800
That was bad, bad music.

415
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,232
And there is nothing as bad
in this world as bad music.

416
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,637
- You know you can record over tapes?
- No.

417
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,801
That was a novelty act.

418
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,038
You want to have actual
sexual intercourse, right?

419
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,879
- Yeah. What, what?
- The girl.

420
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,316
It's all about the girl, isn't it?
Yeah, the girl, yeah.

421
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:42,200
And you're gonna use somebody
else's art to get her? Are you kidding?

422
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,357
We're just starting.

423
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,881
We need to learn how to play.

424
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,594
Did the Sex Pistols know how to play?

425
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,354
You don't need to know
how to play. Who are you?

426
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,440
Steely Dan? You need to learn
how not to play, Conor.

427
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,718
That's the trick. That's rock and roll.

428
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,992
And that takes practice.

429
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,192
And you're not a covers band, by the way.

430
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,596
- Really?
- No.

431
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,155
Every school has a covers band.

432
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,954
Every pub has a covers band.

433
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,515
Every wedding has a covers band.

434
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,678
And every covers band
has a middle-aged member

435
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,596
who'll never know whether they could've
made it in the music industry or not

436
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,281
because they never had the balls
to write a song for someone else.

437
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,518
Rock and roll is a risk.

438
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,156
You risk being ridiculed.

439
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,601
But I don't know how to write a song.

440
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,791
Close that door and sit down.

441
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,315
- Really?
- It's gonna be a long night.

442
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,431
I've school in the morning.

443
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,996
This is school.

444
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,874
"She's standing on the corner
like an angel in disguise.

445
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,721
"I want to try and warn her.

446
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,481
She's got dangerous eyes."

447
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,553
"Dangerous eyes."

448
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,399
I like that.

449
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,961
What does it mean?

450
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,754
I don't know.

451
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,281
What's the song about, Conor?

452
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,034
It's like when you don't know someone,
they're more interesting.

453
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,391
They can be anything you want them to be.

454
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,477
Yeah.

455
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,833
But when you know them,

456
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,315
there's limits to them.

457
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,637
No, that doesn't make any sense.

458
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,559
What's it called?

459
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,434
"The Riddle of the Model."

460
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,393
So what about a rhythm like this?

461
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,359
Nice.

462
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,801
Slow it down a little.

463
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,518
Yeah.

464
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,917
Yeah, that's cool, that's it.

465
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,317
# Standing on the corner #

466
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,996
# Like an angel in disguise #

467
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,192
# I wanna try and warn her #

468
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,636
# She's got dangerous eyes. #

469
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,876
I've an idea.

470
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,230
Maybe for the chorus, like, a...

471
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,034
Yeah.

472
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,152
Yeah. There you can do a stop.

473
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,510
- Yeah.
- And I come in and sing.

474
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,751
# The riddle of the model. #

475
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,076
Like, would everybody stop?

476
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,715
- Yeah. Yeah, everyone.
- Like, the drums

477
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,832
- will do a...
- Yeah.

478
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,190
No, yeah. We-we all stop.

479
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,517
- Fireworks and lights and shit. I don't know.
- Yeah.

480
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,200
- Everyone.
- And they all...

481
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,471
- Everyone stops, yeah.
- Crazy shit, that'd be cool.

482
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,115
- I like that.
- Yeah, yeah.

483
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,755
So maybe like a...

484
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,441
# Oh, oh, oh #

485
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,951
# The riddle of the model. #

486
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,481
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I like that. That's good.

487
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,512
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Yeah.

488
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,961
Do you, do you have a hoover?

489
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,316
Check out this effect.

490
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,114
It's like "Video Killed the Radio Star."

491
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,880
Go.

492
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,961
# Standing in the corner #

493
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,516
# Like an angel in disguise... #

494
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,439
Hey.

495
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,437
How's it going?

496
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,836
Uh, here's the tape.

497
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,634
What's this?

498
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,957
Oh, that's the song;
I mentioned it to you.

499
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,721
Oh, you're the kid in the band.

500
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,159
Yeah, you should probably
learn the lyrics.

501
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,113
So you can lip-sync to them properly.

502
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,153
We're shooting at the lane
at the back of Quinnsworth.

503
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,914
- You know Quinnsworth?
- Yeah.

504
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,077
This Saturday at 12:00.

505
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,471
Cool. Well, I'll try and make it.

506
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,637
What would I wear?

507
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,956
I don't know.

508
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,475
It's kind of like a Chinese theme.

509
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,274
So, like, a kimono?

510
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,597
Well, it's more like a riff than a song.

511
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,873
More of an Eastern bit in the song.

512
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,470
It's called "The Riddle of the Model."

513
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,396
That's really sweet.

514
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,557
Oh.

515
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,394
No, it's not about you.

516
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,000
It's about another model I know.

517
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,555
Oh.

518
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:28,878
Right, well, I'll give it a listen, but I'm,
like, really, really busy at the moment.

519
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,560
You know, so I'll try.

520
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,435
Yeah, you should.
It's a, it's a good song.

521
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,121
We've got a great team.

522
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,193
It's a really good opportunity.

523
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,550
Cool.

524
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,160
So this Saturday at 12:00, then?

525
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,511
12:00. Sounds good.

526
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,791
- Thanks.
- Cool.

527
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,719
Bye.

528
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,275
Looks like loads of gear
back home, doesn't it?

529
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,439
And yet, strangely,
it just looks like shit here.

530
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,598
Yeah.

531
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,712
Ah, hey, where is this chick?

532
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,600
I don't know.

533
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,190
Who the hell brought a cowboy costume?

534
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,756
Me. It's all I could find.

535
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,998
No one wears a cowboy costume in a band.

536
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,396
There's a cowboy in the Village People.

537
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,477
And Adam Ant.

538
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,319
Adam Ant is a highwayman.

539
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,559
So we can have a highwayman,
but we can't have a cowboy?

540
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,672
Are you mentally ill?

541
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,952
I got fangs in the joke shop.

542
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,760
What are you gonna do with them?

543
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,958
- It's a music video, not a bleedin' horror film.
- Spanner.

544
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,311
So what did yous bring?

545
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,315
It's me da's show band outfit.

546
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,591
So it's a gay band?

547
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,711
Okay.

548
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,321
Coming from the one who wants
to look like the Village People.

549
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,835
What's gay about the Village People?

550
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,361
Hello, all. Sorry I'm late.

551
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,035
I was out last night.

552
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,312
At a nightclub.

553
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,671
Jesus Christ, what are you all wearing?

554
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,792
Yeah, we're just working that out.

555
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,400
Um, maybe you can help.

556
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,035
Well, who's your costume person?

557
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,273
We don't really have a costume person.

558
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,312
Well, who's your cameraman?

559
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,671
Maybe he can make some of this work.

560
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,440
Well, we don't really have...

561
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,631
I'm the cameraman.

562
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,956
Thought you were the producer.

563
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,310
And the cameraman.

564
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,080
Saving money at all costs, yeah.

565
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,555
What'd you think of the song?

566
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,796
I really liked it.

567
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,560
It's the only reason I'm here.

568
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,831
Did you write it?

569
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,395
Eamon wrote most of the music.

570
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,875
So you wrote the lyrics?

571
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,116
Cool.

572
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,275
You've got really good cheekbones.

573
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,721
- What?
- Yeah.

574
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,561
Yeah, you should let me do your makeup.

575
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,798
- Really?
- Yeah. Now this light's gonna be

576
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,991
really harsh on camera.

577
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,561
It'll take the edge off.

578
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,240
I'm actually wearing some right now.

579
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,235
In fact, you should all be wearing makeup.

580
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,715
Yeah, I'm not wearing any makeup.

581
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,634
Relax, you're not even in the band.

582
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,240
Yeah, thank God.

583
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,560
I'm in the band, and I will not
be wearing any makeup. Thank you.

584
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,075
Why? You've got great lips.

585
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,521
No, piss off. I'm not wearing makeup.

586
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,274
Whatever.

587
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,199
Those of you who actually
care about the band

588
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,995
and want to do this half
properly, queue over there.

589
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,875
Okay, so we're playing over here,

590
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,594
and Raphina's standing
over there against the wall.

591
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,280
I go up to you and start singing to you.

592
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,760
Make sure to pan up to her eyes when I
sing the line, "She's got dangerous eyes."

593
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,395
I think a zoom would be better.

594
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,080
Okay, a zoom, whatever.

595
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,275
Do you think I should have, lightning
flashes on my eyelids when I close 'em?

596
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,391
Can you do that?

597
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,636
I can do anything.

598
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,195
Cool.

599
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,711
So then for the chorus,
you walk off and I follow,

600
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,511
circling you like when he's
following her in the "Thriller" video.

601
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,519
- Have you seen the "Thriller" video?
- Yeah.

602
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,473
Cool. So then I follow you up the laneway,

603
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,281
keeping behind you, and then we'll swing
around and get the angle in front.

604
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,199
- Let's shoot it.
- Right, let's shoot.

605
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,119
It's just some kids filming something.

606
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,800
What are yous filming, lads?

607
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,641
A video for a band.

608
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,876
Hi, Barry.

609
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,480
Are these in your school, Barry?

610
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,718
Yeah, they are, yeah.

611
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,400
But they're wearing bleedin' makeup.

612
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,716
I know.

613
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,070
Oh, yous making a movie, lads, is it?

614
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,555
Nah, it's just a video for a band.

615
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,035
You should get in a band, Barry.

616
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,033
Put on lipstick, dance around and all.

617
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,158
- You'd be bleedin' great.
- Piss off.

618
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,398
- What did you say?
- Nothin'.

619
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,041
See yous, lads.

620
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,561
See yous at the Oscars.

621
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,231
Right, lads, lots of energy in this.

622
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,478
And, Ngig, I want to see you
really pressing those keys.

623
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,997
Here's some playback.

624
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,475
# She's standing on the corner #

625
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,479
# Like an angel in disguise #

626
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,638
# And as I look a little closer #

627
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,600
# She's got dangerous eyes #

628
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,957
- # She tells me she's a model #
- I'm a model.

629
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,435
# Of international reputation #

630
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,156
# She's lightning in a bottle #

631
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,920
# But there's a stipulation #

632
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,158
# She's so indecipherable #

633
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,274
# She holds the key to the missing code #

634
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,398
# Just the thought of her touch #

635
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,036
# My mind explodes #

636
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,391
# So desirable #

637
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,956
# Time never will unfold #

638
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,118
# Oh, oh, oh #

639
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,880
# The riddle of the model #

640
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,117
# The odds are against her #

641
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,561
# In this little city #

642
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,957
# She's got a taste for adventure #

643
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,232
# And she knows she's pretty #

644
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,591
# She's the face of an angel #

645
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,951
# And the heart of a sinner #

646
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,040
# And if you play with danger #

647
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,561
# How you gonna win her? #

648
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,991
# She's so indecipherable #

649
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,080
# She holds the key to the missing code #

650
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,033
# Just the thought of her touch #

651
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,676
# My mind explodes #

652
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,270
# So desirable #

653
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,233
# Time never will unfold #

654
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,432
# I'll never unravel #

655
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,234
# The riddle of the model. #

656
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,912
Why don't we go eat these in the park?

657
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,077
There you go.

658
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,715
- Thank you.
- No problem.

659
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,114
Can I spin you home?

660
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,676
I didn't know you had a car.

661
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,990
So where d'you live?

662
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,556
Not far from the school. Harcourt Terrace.

663
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,001
Ah, by the canal.

664
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,396
Did you grow up there?

665
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,353
Yeah. Though we're probably moving.

666
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,676
My parents are broke.

667
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,394
That's why they sent me to that school.

668
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,921
Yeah, I was wondering about that.

669
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,873
You're a bit posh for around there.

670
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,992
Speak for yourself. Your house is massive.

671
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,834
Is it?

672
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,554
My parents are probably splitting up.

673
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,274
That's sad. Are you doing okay with it?

674
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,721
Oh, yeah.

675
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,161
It's a bit intense being around them.

676
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,557
Jesus, all that drama.

677
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,593
I'm glad I don't have parents.

678
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,917
Haven't we been down this square already?

679
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,998
Uh, no.

680
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,880
You are the slowest cyclist
I have ever met.

681
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,321
Okay.

682
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,239
Thanks.

683
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,512
- That was great fun.
- Yeah, it was really fun.

684
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,036
Hey, baby!

685
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,311
Hi.

686
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,558
- This is Evan Adams.
- Word.

687
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,035
- How do you do?
- This is the singer

688
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,356
in the band I was telling you about.

689
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,120
Oh, yeah, she played me your song.

690
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,470
Good vibes.

691
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,235
Little bit of Duran Duran in there,
bit of New Romance.

692
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,636
What style would you say you were?

693
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,195
I'm a futurist.

694
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,436
Epic.

695
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,797
See you in the future, then.

696
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,356
- Ready, baby?
- Yeah.

697
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,517
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon.

698
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,439
See you.

699
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,439
Let's make another video sometime.

700
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,315
Nice blouse!

701
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,319
Aw, shit.

702
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,871
You have to imagine it's not as...

703
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,992
Shit?

704
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,475
This will be good.

705
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,274
- Really?
- Yeah.

706
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,597
You just need some proper
cameras and a good director.

707
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,758
But as long as it's in
your head, that's what counts.

708
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,679
It's an exercise in imagination.

709
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,521
Think big, Conor.
This is just a means to an end.

710
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,995
And she looks amazing.

711
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,794
She's got to be in all the videos.

712
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,797
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

713
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,480
She's world-class.

714
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,716
Without her, you're just a bunch
of gay-looking kids down an alleyway.

715
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,831
Have you kissed her yet?

716
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,156
- No way.
- Why not?

717
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,795
She's a year older than me.

718
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,036
And, anyway, she's got a boyfriend.

719
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,630
- Ah. Who?
- Evan Adams.

720
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,195
He's, like, a full-grown man.

721
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,119
He's got a car and all and stubble.

722
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,198
What's he doing hanging out with a kid?

723
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,636
She's not really like a kid.

724
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,991
Hmm.

725
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,077
- What's this?
- Homework.

726
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,720
You're good. Get better.

727
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,639
How d'you know he's her boyfriend anyway?

728
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,115
It seemed like it.

729
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,153
Pulled off in his car, music blaring.

730
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,271
He's pretty cool.

731
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,676
What was he listening to?

732
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,030
Genesis.

733
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,311
He will not be a problem.

734
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,194
- Really?
- Trust me.

735
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,996
No woman can truly love a man
who listens to Phil Collins.

736
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,795
Shh.

737
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,355
Listen.

738
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,280
I think she's having an affair.

739
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,001
What? Why?

740
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,477
She gets a lift home from her
boss a couple of times a week.

741
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,319
She doesn't drive. What's wrong with that?

742
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,671
She gets out of the car about
100 yards away from the house.

743
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,758
It's a nervous thing.

744
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,040
She's overcompensating.

745
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,475
Good night, then.

746
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,514
Hey, Conor, what's going on?

747
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,597
I don't know.

748
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,916
What are you doing?

749
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,913
Just, just rabbit stuff.

750
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,515
D'you want to write a new song?

751
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,712
Yes, I do.

752
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,036
Records.

753
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,914
Really good records.

754
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,360
My brother loves this.

755
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,950
He says it's homework.

756
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,394
You see how bass guitar and the bass
pedal are playing the same rhythm?

757
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,915
You'll hear it now, wait.

758
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,639
I told all of yous, you especially,
shitting on the bed all the time.

759
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,915
You can't put rabbits on the bed
and not expect them to shit on your bed.

760
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,475
A chord like...

761
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,671
Yeah.

762
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,277
Somewhere in the...

763
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,960
# Da, da, da, da, da, miles #

764
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,516
# Miles below me # So...

765
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,440
# Up to the stars she shows me #

766
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,439
# Dame Street, George's Street #

767
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,439
# Miles below me... #

768
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,473
- That's good. I like that.
- Yeah.

769
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,080
I love that middle A.

770
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,954
Yeah, go get the guitar; let's try it out.

771
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,560
It-it'll sound better on the acoustic.

772
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,353
It's gonna sound great with the lads.

773
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:20,556
# It's 2:00 on the edge of the morning #

774
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,436
# She's running magical circles
around my head #

775
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,316
# I hitch a ride on a dream
she's driving #

776
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:32,276
# She turns to kiss me,
I crash back into bed #

777
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:36,156
# Across the street
on a grayed out Monday #

778
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,275
# I see the girl with the eyes
I can't describe #

779
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,951
# And suddenly it's a perfect Sunday #

780
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:47,836
# And everything is more real than life #

781
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,796
# I think I'm back in the dream #

782
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,676
# I think I'm back on the ceiling #

783
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,441
# It's such a beautiful feeling #

784
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,838
# Going up #

785
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,636
# She lights me up #

786
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,641
# She breaks me up #

787
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,799
# She lifts me up #

788
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,196
# You find a mystery bound in perfection #

789
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:23,110
# You've got to read, but
you don't wanna reach the end #

790
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,996
# 'Cause what if everything
beautiful's fiction #

791
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,910
# And this reality's just pretend? #

792
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,080
# And then I'm back in the dream #

793
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:38,717
# Looking up at the ceiling #

794
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,197
# It's such a beautiful feeling #

795
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,712
# Going up #

796
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,880
# She lights me up #

797
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,392
# She breaks me up #

798
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,151
# She lifts me up #

799
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,753
# Up to the stars she shows me #

800
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,674
# Dame Street, George's Street #

801
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,555
# Miles below me #

802
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,595
# Up where the world won't let us down #

803
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,798
# Na, na, na, na #

804
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,479
# Going up #

805
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:35,561
# She lights me up #

806
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,436
# She breaks me up #

807
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,759
# She lifts me up. #

808
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,357
Boys, look at David Bowie.

809
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,279
Oh, I like this.

810
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,516
- What is it?
- My band.

811
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,274
- You're in a band? Cool.
- Yeah.

812
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,391
What are they called?

813
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,154
Sing Street.

814
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,681
Who's this now? Your girlfriend?

815
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,677
Yeah.

816
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,633
No.

817
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,400
She's a friend of mine.

818
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,194
- She's a model.
- Hmm.

819
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,715
But she's got a boyfriend.

820
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,956
An older guy.

821
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,834
Ah.

822
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,635
All the complicated boys and girls.

823
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,238
Good work.

824
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,513
Brother Baxter would like
to see, uh, Conor Lawlor.

825
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,075
Okay. Conor.

826
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,161
Conor Lawlor.

827
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,237
What's going on?

828
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,590
With what?

829
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,836
This.

830
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,634
Oh, well.

831
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,394
I checked the rule book...

832
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,035
the-the one you mentioned
about brown shoes...

833
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,236
and I couldn't find anything about
makeup or altering hair color.

834
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,318
Oh, and look.

835
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,071
I painted these
with paint from the art room.

836
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,790
Head down to the toilet
and remove the makeup right now.

837
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,072
- Why?
- Because I told you to.

838
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,476
But I'm in a band.

839
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,954
It's a school band, and I think
it's important that we have a look.

840
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,834
You're a man. Men don't wear makeup.

841
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,361
But why not?

842
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,598
People in the 18th century wore makeup.

843
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,677
That means people like Mozart
wore makeup, and he was a man.

844
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,191
So you're Mozart now, are you?

845
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,432
That makes me Salieri, is it?

846
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,915
Who's Salieri?

847
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,351
You've a fine face.

848
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,633
Pretty enough without makeup.

849
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,593
Take it off.

850
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,031
You can use my bathroom, if you like.

851
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,394
Come on in here.

852
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,593
I'm gonna go to class now.

853
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,631
Jesus!

854
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,516
You can't do this!

855
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,439
Do you want to bet?

856
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,120
I'll get you clean, don't worry.

857
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,595
Clean you all up.

858
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,991
Get all that shite off you.

859
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,671
Take pride in your God-given features.

860
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,120
No more Ziggy Stardust.

861
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,991
- Hey, Cosmo.
- Who?

862
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:51,681
Cosmo. That's what I'm calling you now.

863
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,475
You're gonna need a catchy name
if you're gonna be in a band.

864
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,671
Right.

865
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,280
What happened?

866
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,676
Nothing.

867
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,076
Come on.

868
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,114
I really liked your song.

869
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,800
It made me cry.

870
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,797
Oh.

871
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,799
I'm really sorry.

872
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,476
No, that's a good thing.

873
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,398
So who's the guy with the car?

874
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,841
Evan?

875
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,395
Yeah.

876
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,161
Is he your boyfriend?

877
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,840
We're on and off.

878
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,793
It's complicated.

879
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,277
We're actually on
a little break at the moment.

880
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,040
Yeah.

881
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,834
Good idea.

882
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,759
Take a break for a year or so.

883
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,521
Get some perspective.

884
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,918
He's actually a really nice guy.

885
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,555
Yeah.

886
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,957
Shit taste in music, though.

887
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,799
We're going to London soon.

888
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,436
I'm too young to go on my own,
so he's organized everything.

889
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,032
What's in it for Evan?

890
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,515
Are you jealous, Cosmo?

891
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,916
Why would I be jealous?

892
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,361
Exactly.

893
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,271
Will you write me a happy song sometime?

894
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,676
I need a laugh.

895
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,155
But what if I don't feel happy?

896
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:13,071
Your problem is that you're
not happy being sad.

897
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,000
But that's what love is, Cosmo.

898
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,680
Happy-sad.

899
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,034
Shit, I've got to go soon.

900
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,751
We only have a half hour
dinner window in our house.

901
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,872
So, what's the house like, where you live?

902
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,441
It's nice.

903
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:36,440
Nicer than some of the dumps
I've lived in.

904
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,679
So where are your parents?

905
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:40,911
My dad's brown bread.

906
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,317
He got hit by a car.

907
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,512
Oh, my God. Sorry.

908
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,638
Really don't be.

909
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,559
He was a drunk. He deserved it.

910
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,560
And me ma's in and out of hospital.

911
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,081
Why?

912
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,476
She's a nurse.

913
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,115
Oh, right.

914
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,551
No, she's manic-depressive.

915
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,118
So, like, happy-sad.

916
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,676
You're funny, I like that.

917
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:14,401
Well, let me know if you need me
for any more videos before I go.

918
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,596
When are you going?

919
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,354
Soon.

920
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,559
What did she mean by that?

921
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,159
Well, I think what she means is that
you need to reach a place in your life

922
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,795
where you're okay with your sadness.

923
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,196
It's pretty high concept stuff.

924
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,590
How old d'you say she was again?

925
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:44,632
Sixteen.

926
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,081
It's monastic.

927
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,231
She's like a monk.

928
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,432
She sounds really pretentious.

929
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,996
Why, 'cause she wants to leave
school and follow her vocation?

930
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,721
You call wanting to be a model a vocation?

931
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,514
Anything can be a vocation, Ann.

932
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,759
Being a taxi driver,
being a bin man, being a poet,

933
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,992
being a singer, being an artist.

934
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,397
Brendan, I never wanted to be an artist.

935
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,437
We couldn't get the brush out of your hand
when you were a kid.

936
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:08,791
What is wrong with being an architect?

937
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,150
It's not a vocation.

938
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,591
I thought everything was a vocation.

939
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,439
Don't be playing word games with me, Ann.

940
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,991
I don't do "words," all right?

941
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:19,317
Come on, Conor.

942
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,519
Turn out the lights
before you go to bed, Ann.

943
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,360
So her dad's dead
and her mam is a lunatic.

944
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,835
And you thought you had problems.

945
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:32,432
I see now what the older
boyfriend thing is about.

946
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,439
Daddy issues.

947
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,075
I used to know chicks like this.

948
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,352
They're tricky, and they need
a lot of protecting.

949
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,710
Are you up to that, Conor?

950
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,117
I don't know.

951
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,153
So what's it all about?

952
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:47,513
I think she's just an amazing human being.

953
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,759
I've never seen anyone like her.

954
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,237
The way she talks and looks.

955
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:58,391
She wears these sunglasses,
and when she takes them off, her eyes

956
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,200
are like the clouds
clearing past the moon.

957
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,593
Sometimes I just
want to cry looking at her.

958
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:11,075
They're happy-sad.

959
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,959
So how do you mean you're "happy-sad"?

960
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,959
Yeah, how am I supposed to market that?

961
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,640
It means we're not pop anymore.

962
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,081
We were pop?

963
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,351
Listen, I'm happy being anything.

964
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,915
I just want to play music.

965
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:40,031
That's fine.

966
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,151
Be who you are, Eamon.

967
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:42,920
Well, I don't know who I am.

968
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,270
Maybe I'm happy-sad, too.

969
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,795
I don't know.

970
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,321
What does happy-sad even mean?

971
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,319
How can we be both things?
It makes no sense.

972
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,080
It means that I'm stuck in this shithole

973
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:55,759
full of morons and rapists and bullies,
and I'm gonna deal with it, okay?

974
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:58,111
It's just how life is.

975
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,552
I'm gonna try and accept it
and get on with it

976
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,911
and make some art.

977
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,395
So how does that affect our music?

978
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,399
- Positively.
- All right.

979
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,715
Okay.

980
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:42,150
So the idea of this video is about a guy
standing halfway down a pier,

981
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,441
and a beautiful woman walks past him
towards the lighthouse.

982
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,918
Half an hour later, she hasn't come back.

983
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,681
So he investigates, but she's gone.

984
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:52,831
What?

985
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,837
She killed herself.

986
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,760
No, she's a mermaid,
and she's jumped back into the sea.

987
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:59,786
You see, she got washed up in
a fishing net so she's been in the city,

988
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:02,792
and she's been dying to get back
to the water, to her friends.

989
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,071
Back to where she belongs.

990
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,794
That's much better.

991
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:08,561
I know.

992
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,514
Okay, so we're playing here
and Raphina walks by.

993
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,553
- So where do I jump from?
- Here.

994
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:16,196
- Aah!
- Yeah.

995
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,835
How'd that look, lads?

996
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,031
Yeah, it looked all right.

997
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,316
It's a bit shit.

998
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,241
That supposed to look like
they're jumping in or something?

999
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,511
Yeah.

1000
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:25,995
It doesn't.

1001
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:30,041
Trust me. It'll work.

1002
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,958
# Fake deals in the supermarket #

1003
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:48,392
# TVs selling what you can't get #

1004
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,595
# She laughs, "Nowhere is
as pretty as this" #

1005
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,759
# Gray cars crawlin' in the slow lane #

1006
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:02,158
# Lost stars waiting for the DART train #

1007
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:06,480
# She smiles, turns and blows
the city a kiss #

1008
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,758
# Under the waves I feel her #

1009
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,039
# Pull my body down... #

1010
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,595
- Shit.
- # Under the waves #

1011
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,479
- What the hell, Raphina?
- # She takes me... #

1012
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,797
Keep bloody filming! Save me!

1013
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,275
I can't swim!

1014
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,677
# I can be miles away #

1015
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,919
# She calls to me #

1016
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,431
# This girl is a beautiful sea #

1017
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:36,711
# The girl is a beautiful sea. #

1018
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,514
- What were you thinking?
- Did you get it?

1019
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:39,517
Yeah, it was great!

1020
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,598
Ah! Fantastic!

1021
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:42,757
Can you really not swim?

1022
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,281
No.

1023
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:45,721
So why'd you do that, then?

1024
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:48,800
For our art, Cosmo.

1025
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:51,237
You can never do anything by half.

1026
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:52,954
Do you understand that?

1027
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,919
I'm... I'm sorry.

1028
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,520
Look, I was...

1029
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,200
Great is what it was.

1030
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:11,358
Fair play.

1031
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,121
What about Evan?

1032
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,595
Yeah, you ruined it.

1033
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:34,555
You know, on a clear day, you can
actually see the mainland of Britain.

1034
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:37,514
Island's only 30 miles
from the coast of Wales.

1035
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:40,440
Bet you didn't know that.

1036
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:43,872
It has to have just rained,
no dust in the air.

1037
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:47,153
You can just about see it.

1038
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,601
No way.

1039
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,075
How do you know stuff like that?

1040
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:52,591
My granddad worked
on the ships to Holyhead.

1041
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,917
He used to take me out here.

1042
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,796
We used to go out
in his little boat, fishing.

1043
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,992
Wow.

1044
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:04,080
So I can wave back to you
when I'm in London.

1045
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:16,877
My brother says all the great artists
had to get off this island.

1046
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:20,672
The ones who stayed got depressed
and turned into alcoholics.

1047
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,481
Makes sense.

1048
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:25,513
You talk about your brother a lot.

1049
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:29,038
Do you really love him?

1050
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,152
He was gonna go to Germany
when he was younger.

1051
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:35,398
But my parents would never let him go
without finishing school.

1052
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:41,316
He was gonna run away; he had
the whole thing planned, so he says.

1053
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,556
So what happened?

1054
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,434
My mum found out.

1055
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:45,551
She closed it down.

1056
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,116
She didn't want him to go.

1057
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:50,756
Maybe she loved him too much.

1058
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,395
Yeah.

1059
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,080
Actually, I think you're right.

1060
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:57,797
That's what my dad always used to say.

1061
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:00,271
When my ma would be
in hospital, in a spell,

1062
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,233
and it was just the two of us.

1063
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,398
So I'd get all dressed up
to go out with my friends,

1064
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,080
then he'd make me stay in.

1065
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:07,555
And afterwards, he'd say,

1066
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,838
"I love you too much, is all."

1067
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:14,038
And the thing is, me ma's
much better-looking than I am,

1068
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,120
so I don't really know
why he'd bother with me.

1069
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,720
It's a strange kind of love, isn't it?

1070
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,071
Parents.

1071
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,320
I would've saved her.

1072
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,034
And I could've.

1073
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,561
- No, you couldn't have.
- I could've.

1074
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,276
- You're too small.
- I'm not too small.

1075
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,471
You're way too small.

1076
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:42,830
I've a good joke for you guys.

1077
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,396
Vagina. Do you get it?

1078
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:46,921
- No.
- Exactly.

1079
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:51,396
All right, uh...

1080
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,160
why did the pink...

1081
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:06,160
Look at her.

1082
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:10,632
She races home every evening just
to catch that last little bit of sun...

1083
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,437
have a cigarette and read her papers.

1084
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:19,032
She's always talking about
going on a holiday to Spain.

1085
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:22,711
But he never takes her.

1086
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:25,555
That's all she gets.

1087
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:29,072
Then that tall tree blocks it,
and she comes in.

1088
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,437
I often wonder what she's thinking about.

1089
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,760
That's amazing.

1090
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,675
Ah, how's the band getting along?

1091
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:18,837
What are they called again?

1092
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,111
"The Queers"?

1093
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:21,470
Good one, Barry.

1094
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:23,752
Is, uh, anyone getting these down?

1095
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,440
You know who you're a bit like, Barry?

1096
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,881
Uh, Oscar Wilde.

1097
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:28,151
What class is he in, then?

1098
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:30,278
He's not in school, Barry, you spanner.

1099
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,520
You know I am gonna kill you
one of these days.

1100
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,875
No, you're not.

1101
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,317
- 'Cause you don't even exist.
- What?

1102
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:42,638
Maybe you're living in my world;
I'm not living in yours.

1103
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,912
You're just material for my songs.

1104
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,271
Man, I'd be very careful about
what you say to me next.

1105
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:48,471
Floor him, Barry.

1106
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:49,876
I don't want to have to batter you again.

1107
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,196
Go ahead, Barry.

1108
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,921
Go on.

1109
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:02,998
You only have the power to stop things.

1110
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,714
But not to create.

1111
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:19,113
"End of term disco at the school hall.

1112
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:20,914
DJ and lights." So?

1113
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,516
I say we ask if we can
play there. First gig.

1114
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:25,200
- We're not ready.
- We could be.

1115
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,472
We need a deadline,
something to prepare for.

1116
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,831
We have exams.
We need to prepare for them.

1117
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,998
Yeah, they're midterm exams.
They don't mean anything.

1118
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:34,875
Yeah, well, they do to my ma.
She wants me to go to college.

1119
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,311
Get qualifications and all.

1120
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:38,841
Will there be girls at the disco?

1121
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:41,840
- Yes.
- I say we do it.

1122
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,361
We have five songs.

1123
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:46,195
We'd need a half-hour set, so three more.

1124
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:48,074
# Who the hell are you #

1125
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:50,079
# To tell me what to do #

1126
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:51,601
# You wear a dress #

1127
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,475
# And tell me not to wear brown shoes #

1128
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:56,638
# Do you think you... #

1129
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,392
Come on, where are you going?

1130
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:03,875
It's half-9:00 at night.

1131
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,541
Why are you acting,
all of a sudden, as if it matters?

1132
00:58:05,642 --> 00:58:07,317
- Come on, this is bullshit.
- As if you care?

1133
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:09,676
You're gonna go down the street.
You're gonna be back in ten minutes.

1134
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:11,514
- Not this time.
- That's what you always say.

1135
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,280
It is not what I always say!

1136
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,911
- It's 9:00 at night! It's dark!
- I've got somewhere to go to.

1137
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,761
You're not taking the car. I suppose Mr.
What's-His-Name will come around in his.

1138
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,634
- His name's Tony.
- Tony can come around with his.

1139
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:23,471
What about this dress? This dress is lovely.
Do you want to take that one?

1140
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,751
- Don't touch my things!
- You'd look pretty sexy in that one.

1141
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,470
When was the last time you noticed
anything I wore, any way that I looked?

1142
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,637
That's a pretty sexy one, isn't it?
He'll love that one, won't he?

1143
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,195
What about knickers?
Have you got knickers?

1144
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,471
- You probably don't. You don't need knickers...
- Just put them away!

1145
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:39,876
This is life, Conor.

1146
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,321
Drive it like you stole it.

1147
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,475
Come on!

1148
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:00,791
No!

1149
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:03,391
- Come on, get her up.
- Let's get her up!

1150
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:07,278
What do you think you're doing?

1151
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,275
That's great!

1152
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:31,078
Try a bit of hi-hat, Larry.

1153
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,439
# You just can't stand the way #

1154
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:38,032
# That I walked out from the wreckage #

1155
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:43,395
# Can't understand the way
that I turned myself around #

1156
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:47,475
# I tried to terminate this war #

1157
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:49,035
# With you #

1158
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,391
# But you won't let it go #

1159
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:55,071
# You keep coming back for more... #

1160
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:57,079
And begin.

1161
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,679
What does this even mean?

1162
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:19,032
Suck my balls.

1163
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:21,391
- Quiet!
- Night now.

1164
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,277
- Hey.
- Hi.

1165
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,757
Do you want to go on an adventure?

1166
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,758
Oh. Okay.

1167
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,473
Do you see the pole there, the yellow one?

1168
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,995
Yeah.

1169
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,078
That's where we're heading.

1170
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:14,511
If my parents found out
I took this out, they'd kill me.

1171
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,041
Have you taken it out before?

1172
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:17,311
Every few weeks.

1173
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:21,799
A boat's like a musical instrument...
it doesn't like it if you don't use it.

1174
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:26,632
That's what my granddad said, you know,
so I like to look after it for him.

1175
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,081
Look, there's the ferry
heading to England.

1176
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:32,320
Full of Irish people.

1177
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,278
Okay, so go.

1178
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:48,281
"You just can't stand the way
that we walked out from the wreckage."

1179
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:50,040
What wreckage?

1180
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,356
Maybe the wreckage of family.

1181
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:52,716
That's what I was thinking about.

1182
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,037
Okay, next.

1183
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:59,871
"You just can't stand the way
that I turned my life around."

1184
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,516
That's about you.

1185
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,678
What do you mean?

1186
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:09,312
Well, I was thinking about my parents
and how I thought I had problems.

1187
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,432
And the way you've turned
your life around.

1188
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,393
How have I turned my life around?

1189
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,116
Well, look at you.
You're going to a new country.

1190
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,641
You've got a vocation. You look amazing.

1191
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,717
- Stop.
- Stop what?

1192
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:24,034
Just get on with the song.
What's the video gonna be about?

1193
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:28,959
So... I think it's set at a school prom,
like in an American high school.

1194
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,277
I've always wanted to go
to an American school.

1195
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:33,392
With girls and hair gel.

1196
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,081
Have you seen "Back to the Future"?

1197
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,999
I see all the films.

1198
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:41,080
Imagine the band, all in suits.

1199
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,431
I have all the shots planned in my head.

1200
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:45,234
My brother told me to think big.

1201
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:47,717
And what if I come in a big '50s dress?

1202
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,275
Yeah.

1203
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,553
And the whole crowd parts
and everyone disappears.

1204
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:56,117
And then we all break out
into this big dance routine,

1205
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,198
and everyone is there.

1206
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:02,238
And then you and I
just run off into the night

1207
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:05,320
with the twinkling lights
of the city behind us.

1208
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:10,439
You were a bit attractive back there.

1209
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:12,718
Back where?

1210
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,481
On the boat.

1211
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,080
Thank you.

1212
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:19,318
Just a little bit.

1213
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,871
Bit like a captain.

1214
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:24,311
I like that.

1215
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:26,637
Aye-aye.

1216
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,957
You're always very attractive.

1217
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:30,799
I know.

1218
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:32,957
And very conceited.

1219
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,475
Just stop talking.

1220
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:35,671
For once.

1221
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:03,477
I've just...

1222
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,631
Sorry.

1223
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:11,441
- Now, is it...?
- Oh, yeah.

1224
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:12,517
Yeah.

1225
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:25,878
So when are we shooting this video?

1226
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:27,674
Saturday next.

1227
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:30,155
Oh.

1228
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:41,518
Conor?

1229
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,799
Good. You're up.

1230
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:57,159
If this is about my exam results...

1231
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,681
I can explain, see...

1232
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:00,679
It's not about your exams, Conor.

1233
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:03,191
We need to talk to all of you. Sit down.

1234
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,638
Well, so, firstly, we don't want to
make a big deal about this, you know.

1235
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:10,951
It's something we've thought about a lot.

1236
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:11,992
A lot of married couples...

1237
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,794
Your father and I are splitting up.

1238
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,355
Thank you. That's great.

1239
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,199
It was just a matter of time.

1240
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:18,596
I'll go get the bags packed.

1241
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:20,121
Let me know when we're ready to go.

1242
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,994
Why don't you sit down,
Brendan, for a second?

1243
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:23,635
We'll tell you what we're thinking.

1244
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,151
You see if you agree.

1245
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:29,160
A consensus?

1246
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,278
That's novel. Okay.

1247
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:36,715
Your mother has fallen in love with Tony.

1248
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:39,310
They're gonna be moving into
his apartment for awhile and...

1249
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,397
Yeah.

1250
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,274
We've had an offer on this house.

1251
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:45,075
It's half what it's worth,
but we're gonna take it.

1252
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:47,113
I can't afford to live here on my own.

1253
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:49,597
So you're getting a divorce?

1254
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:53,318
Can't get divorced in Ireland,
so we'll be legally separated.

1255
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:57,999
I'm gonna be getting an apartment, and
you three will live between there and...

1256
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:59,475
there.

1257
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:01,871
I'm not gonna be staying at Tony's.

1258
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:04,755
Let's get that crystal clear.

1259
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:07,396
I'd rather sleep on the street.

1260
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:11,560
I understand this is upsetting
for you, Brendan.

1261
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,399
You don't understand anything!

1262
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:15,956
For all of you.

1263
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,638
This is bullshit.

1264
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,555
So you were right.

1265
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,718
They're just human beings.
I told you that.

1266
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:28,039
I was sort of hoping they'd come
to my gig at the end of the month.

1267
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,198
What, you thought they'd just
become different people

1268
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:34,115
and start noticing what you were doing
and what you wanted?

1269
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:36,996
They've got their own shit going on.
They're not going to your stupid gig.

1270
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,475
So why is it stupid now?

1271
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:40,439
It's not that it's stupid,
it's just annoying.

1272
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:42,831
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know. I'm in withdrawal!

1273
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,895
- From what?
- I haven't smoked hash in two days, Conor.

1274
01:06:45,996 --> 01:06:48,553
- Why?
- So I can do something with my life.

1275
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:50,274
Like what?

1276
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:02,593
Do you see that guitar?

1277
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:05,190
I used to be able
to play that guitar... well.

1278
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,994
I used to ride hot girls.

1279
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:10,193
I could run 200 meters faster
than anybody in my school.

1280
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:11,880
You're the youngest.

1281
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:14,914
You get to follow the path that I macheted

1282
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:17,317
through the jungle that is our mad family.

1283
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:20,001
I was alone with them for six years.

1284
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,475
You think they're crazy now?

1285
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:24,280
Think about what they were like
when they were in their late 20s.

1286
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:27,155
Two Catholics in a rented flat
with a screaming baby,

1287
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:29,557
who just got married because
they wanted to have sex.

1288
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,798
They didn't even love each other.

1289
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:34,197
I was in the middle of that, alone.

1290
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,476
And then you came along.

1291
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,433
Thank God!

1292
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,518
And you followed...

1293
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,951
the path that I cut for us.

1294
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:43,919
Untouched.

1295
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:46,676
You just moved in my jet stream.

1296
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:48,155
And people laugh at me, Conor.

1297
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:51,353
The stoner, the college dropout.

1298
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:53,154
And they praise you, which is fine!

1299
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:55,079
But once...

1300
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:57,591
I was a fucking jet engine!

1301
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:31,312
Back in a second.

1302
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:33,239
Need to go to the bathroom.

1303
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,115
Ngig.

1304
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:03,514
- Can you move that mic stand over a bit more.
- Are you expecting her soon?

1305
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:06,560
I thought she was coming,
but I don't know where she is.

1306
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:09,236
Right, so you better get something filmed.
Yous have an hour.

1307
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:11,681
Come on, Conor. She's not coming.

1308
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:14,794
- Let's just do whatever.
- Okay.

1309
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,600
Come over, guys.

1310
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:22,354
Okay, so this is like a school video,
except not like an Irish school,

1311
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:25,041
more like an American school,
and it's prom night.

1312
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:26,993
Have you seen "Back to the Future"?

1313
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:31,679
Okay, well, it's just kind of
like '50s dancing, and...

1314
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:33,235
Like what?

1315
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:38,119
It's... like dancing from the '50s,
you know, clicking fingers and...

1316
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:39,755
Can we try some now, actually? Just...

1317
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:42,157
Yeah. Yeah.

1318
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:43,550
That's it. Yeah.

1319
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:45,160
Yeah, maybe do a few twirls and stuff.

1320
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:46,510
Just do what's natural.

1321
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:48,200
Make it as natural as possible.

1322
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:49,880
Let's get some playback.

1323
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,079
# You just can't stand the way #

1324
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:17,239
# That I walked out from the wreckage #

1325
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:19,677
# Can't understand the way #

1326
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:23,317
# That I turned myself around #

1327
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:27,435
# I tried to terminate this war #

1328
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,040
# With you #

1329
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:31,079
# But you won't let it go #

1330
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:34,831
# You keep coming back for more #

1331
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:37,561
# Freedom, I'm takin' it back #

1332
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:40,594
# I'm outta here, no turnin' back #

1333
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,872
# In a baby blue Cadillac #

1334
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,596
# Just when I was stallin' #

1335
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,798
# I heard an angel callin' #

1336
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,116
# This is your life #

1337
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:52,712
# You can go anywhere #

1338
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:55,310
# You gotta grab the wheel and own it #

1339
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:58,235
# And drive it like you stole it #

1340
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:00,358
# Roll it, this is your life #

1341
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:04,361
# You can be anything #

1342
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:07,235
# You gotta learn to rock and roll it #

1343
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,954
# You gotta put the pedal down #

1344
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:11,641
# And drive it like you stole it #

1345
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:17,436
# And drive it like you stole it #

1346
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:24,797
# We get stuck in the dirt #

1347
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:28,437
# And we can't see where we're goin' #

1348
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:30,552
# We face all kinds of hurt #

1349
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:33,793
# And the friction slows us down #

1350
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:35,560
# But I won't be waiting here #

1351
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:39,470
# For the world to win me gold #

1352
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:41,957
# I'll leave your dust behind me #

1353
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:45,153
# Stranded in the road #

1354
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:46,994
# Freedom #

1355
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:48,475
# I'm takin' it back #

1356
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:49,637
# Attitude #

1357
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:50,956
# I'm givin' it back #

1358
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:53,397
# In a baby blue Cadillac #

1359
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,990

# You can go anywhere #

1363

# And drive it like you stole it #

1375
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:54,281
# Hoo, hoo, hoo-ooh-ooh #

1376
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,996
# And drive it like you stole it #

1377
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:59,841
# Hoo, hoo, hoo-ooh-ooh #

1378
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:02,715
# And drive it like you stole it #

1379
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:05,595
# Hoo, hoo, hoo-ooh-ooh #

1380
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,758
# And drive it like you stole it #

1381
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:11,317
# Hoo, hoo, hoo-ooh-ooh. #

1382
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:29,071
Um...

1383
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:30,760
All right, let's shoot it.

1384
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:46,115
- Oh.
- Yeah?

1385
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:48,232
Hi. Is Raphina there?

1386
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,915
No. She doesn't live here anymore.

1387
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:54,117
- Wh-Where is she?
- I don't know.

1388
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:56,511
Are you the bloke in the band?

1389
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:58,234
Yeah.

1390
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:01,921
I lost money on you.

1391
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,037
What?

1392
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:04,914
Yeah, we all... had bets going.

1393
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:06,714
Thought you were gonna win.

1394
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:09,635
Look, she was always gonna
do her own thing, wasn't she?

1395
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:11,758
She's mad like that, determined.

1396
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:14,077
Where is she?

1397
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:16,636
She's gone to London
with her fella. Last night.

1398
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:19,720
Wow, um...

1399
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,798
Did she leave any message
for me or anything?

1400
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:26,117
No.

1401
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:28,760
All right. No, uh...

1402
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:34,474
That's cool, yeah.

1403
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:35,921
Your songs are good.

1404
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:37,191
Thanks.

1405
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:31,398
Hold on to that nice and tight there.

1406
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:35,437
That's... 71 inches.

1407
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:45,835
# And I'm back in the dream #

1408
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:51,753
# Think I'm back on the ceiling #

1409
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:54,077
# Goin' up #

1410
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:58,995
# She lights me up #

1411
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:04,394
# She breaks me up #

1412
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:09,395
# She lifts me #

1413
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:12,241
# Up #

1414
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:15,194
# Goin' up #

1415
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:19,958
# She lights me up... #

1416
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:27,232
- Raphina?
- No, sorry.

1417
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,312
- Hey, wait.
- What?

1418
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:30,756
Raphina.

1419
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:33,441
- Who?
- Raphina.

1420
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:36,597
Oh, no, I'm Raphina's
younger sister. Sorry.

1421
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,799
No, you're not.

1422
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:42,311
What are you doing?
I thought you were in London.

1423
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:56,072
I mean, it was a mad idea, anyway.

1424
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,511
Don't even know anyone in London.

1425
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:00,837
I thought he had booked tickets.

1426
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,190
No.

1427
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:05,519
No, that was just an act to get a ride.

1428
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:09,074
He doesn't even have a flat
or friends or any of that.

1429
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,554
So where is he now?

1430
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,559
I don't know.

1431
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:16,798
He left me in a B and B in town.

1432
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:18,435
We had this big row.

1433
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:22,916
He said I wasn't pretty enough to be
a model, and that I was too small.

1434
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:25,636
Kinda true. I'm pretty short.

1435
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:28,799
What happened to your cheek?

1436
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,436
Did he hit you?

1437
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:33,518
Yeah, but I totally deserved it.

1438
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:42,954
So what are you gonna do now?

1439
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:44,276
I don't know.

1440
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:48,321
I was gonna print some CVs,
but I haven't really done anything,

1441
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,797
except your videos.

1442
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:53,993
McDonald's have an ad in their window.

1443
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:56,078
Would you still fancy me if I did that?

1444
01:17:56,190 --> 01:17:57,874
"D'you want chips with that?"

1445
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:02,794
As long as you're happy.

1446
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:08,679
So that's my life now.

1447
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:12,519
Working at McDonald's,

1448
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:15,793
hanging out with a 15-year-old schoolboy.

1449
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,832
I'm exactly like my ma.

1450
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:22,839
I'm mad.

1451
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,361
I have to go now.

1452
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:27,995
I have a gig to rehearse for.

1453
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,600
Oh, tell me about that.

1454
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:31,678
No.

1455
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:28,878
Will you help me write a song?

1456
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:32,198
Always.

1457
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,721
# I gotta find out... #

1458
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:35,559
- F sharp minor.
- # Who I'm meant... #

1459
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,513
- And E.
- # To be... #

1460
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:39,632
Just keep doing that.

1461
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:43,880
# Don't believe in destiny. #

1462
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:47,831
Why doesn't she believe in destiny?

1463
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,032
Well...

1464
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:51,959
she was always going on about London.

1465
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:55,832
It was so important to her,
almost like part of her identity.

1466
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:59,432
But maybe it was just in her head.

1467
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:01,632
And it wasn't really her destiny at all.

1468
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,991
Why don't you take her to London?

1469
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:08,796
How much is a plane ticket to London?

1470
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:10,639
Yeah.

1471
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,912
Anyway, what about the band?

1472
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:14,555
The band will be fine.

1473
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:16,877
Just go to London and get a record deal.

1474
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:19,715
Come back and just
get us out of this shithole.

1475
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,275
That's not a bad idea, actually.

1476
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:22,277
Mm.

1477
01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:29,356
# You were racin' like a cannonball... #

1478
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:30,756
Nice.

1479
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:32,871
Yeah.

1480
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:34,321
Make a nice piano bit.

1481
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:35,477
Yeah.

1482
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:38,517
Shit!

1483
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:43,515
Take him down!

1484
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:06,519
I'm sorry that I didn't know about
you playing guitar and everything.

1485
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:07,791
It's cool.

1486
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:10,720
There's a lot of stuff
you don't know about me.

1487
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:13,356
You should come play a solo, at the gig.

1488
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:15,755
Okay, I probably will.

1489
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:18,753
You know, it's been a, it's been a while
since you've been out of the house.

1490
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:21,751
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

1491
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:24,395
Okay.

1492
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:26,911
So I'll see you there, then.

1493
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:28,361
Yeah. Cool.

1494
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:30,359
Sounds like it could be fun.

1495
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:32,234
Cool. All right.

1496
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:34,000
See you later.

1497
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:40,992
Cool, she's not here.

1498
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:45,756
Do you know where the photocopier is?

1499
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:47,275
- Yeah.
- Photocopy 200 of these.

1500
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:48,516
Why?

1501
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:50,758
You'll see.

1502
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:52,156
Come on, Darren.

1503
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:55,353
We've got one more thing to do.

1504
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:58,155
Now leave this to me.

1505
01:21:58,270 --> 01:21:59,715
Yeah.

1506
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:03,834
Who's that, Barry?

1507
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:05,952
If it's the TV license man,
tell him to piss off.

1508
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:07,754
What do yous want?

1509
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:09,759
- We want to talk to you.
- Shut up, you stupid bitch!

1510
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:12,921
You know what, Barry, you think
you're different from us, and you are.

1511
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:14,475
You're bleedin' nuts.

1512
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:16,592
We all have one thing
in common... me, you and him.

1513
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:19,680
We're all shit at school.
We're bleedin' useless.

1514
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:21,360
- So?
- What are you gonna do

1515
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:22,801
when you get kicked out of school?

1516
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:25,794
Stay at home with your ma and da
watching day-time telly, getting wasted?

1517
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:27,190
Yeah, okay.

1518
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:29,199
Well, we're gonna be in a band.

1519
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:30,914
Gigging, on the road.

1520
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:33,431
Different venues each night,
different women.

1521
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:35,040
And d'you know what bands need?

1522
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,675
What do bands need?

1523
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:38,633
Roadies.

1524
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:41,475
Someone who is strong.
Someone who can fight.

1525
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:43,314
Get in here, Barry,
and get us another beer!

1526
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:44,801
You worthless shite!

1527
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:46,480
I'm a worthless shite.

1528
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:48,957
I mean, what would you want
with me in a fag band?

1529
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:51,391
Being in a band is like being in the army.

1530
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:53,990
Everyone has everyone's back.

1531
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:56,351
D'you think you're up for it?

1532
01:22:56,470 --> 01:23:01,153
Get in here and get us another can,
Barry, or do you want another smack?

1533
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:05,552
Where do you think you're going?

1534
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:07,240
Get back here, you little prick!

1535
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:09,433
Okay, that was good,
but now it's time for some live music.

1536
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:22,878
Faggots!

1537
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:24,674
Hello, Dublin.

1538
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:26,679
We're Sing Street from Dublin.

1539
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:29,356
Faggot!

1540
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:32,595
Dad, you shouldn't have come here
if you're just gonna slag us.

1541
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:36,992
This is called "Girls."

1542
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:53,231
# Sometimes I pull myself apart #

1543
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:57,600
# I shift my shape
the way I change my colors #

1544
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:59,917
# Guess I'm a human work of art #

1545
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:04,956
# A never-ending video-o-o #

1546
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:07,511
# Truth gets distorted by the facts #

1547
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:13,031
# Peace is in danger
and the trust gets broken #

1548
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:15,835
# Love always comes under attack #

1549
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:19,078
# But at the end of all of this #

1550
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:20,840
# Oh, oh, oh #

1551
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:23,317
# All the complicated boys #

1552
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:28,914
# Boys know that the girls
are so complicated #

1553
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:31,078
# Try to open up your mind #

1554
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:35,559
# Let go, can you feel
your heart liberated #

1555
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:38,913
# By the complicated boys,
boys, boys, boys? #

1556
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:43,479
# And the complicated girls,
girls, girls, girls #

1557
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:47,994
# We're all just diamonds in the rough #

1558
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:52,633
# I'm still a stranger
in the bathroom mirror #

1559
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:54,798
# Stare at me long and hard enough #

1560
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:59,071
# You might see someone that you love #

1561
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:00,555
Faggots!

1562
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:03,753
# All the complicated boys, boys know #

1563
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:07,192
# That the girls are so complicated #

1564
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:11,959
# Try to open up your mind, let go #

1565
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:14,357
# Can you feel your heart liberated #

1566
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:18,231
# By the complicated boys,
boys, boys, boys? #

1567
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:22,600
# And the complicated girls,
girls, girls, girls #

1568
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:26,396
# By the complicated boys,
boys, boys, boys #

1569
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:30,560
# And the complicated girls,
girls, girls, girls #

1570
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:32,798
# Oh, it's complicated. #

1571
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:42,358
That was shite!

1572
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:46,395
# This girl is a beautiful sea #

1573
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:52,832
# The girl is a beautiful sea. #

1574
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:56,199
Thank you.

1575
01:26:58,870 --> 01:27:00,520
Yes.

1576
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:02,837
Come on, keep going!

1577
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,873
Get off the stage!

1578
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:10,271
Okay, here's one called "To Find You."

1579
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:11,596
It's a slow song.

1580
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:16,471
Conor, we're not playing
a bleedin' slow song at a gig.

1581
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:18,433
- Are you mad?
- No?

1582
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:20,200
They love us. We'll blow it.

1583
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:21,232
Eamon?

1584
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:23,637
I don't know, it's a bold move.

1585
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:27,033
Let's do it.

1586
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:33,841
Okay, this song's for anyone
who thought they had a girlfriend

1587
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:37,352
for a day, but then she just
turned out to be a friend.

1588
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:39,990
What's that about?

1589
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:53,913
# When you were starin'
at your bedroom wall #

1590
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:58,359
# With only ghosts beside you #

1591
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:05,753
# Somewhere out where the wind
was calling #

1592
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:11,559
# I was on my way to find you #

1593
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:18,712
# I was on my way to find you #

1594
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:29,080
# When you were racin' like a cannonball #

1595
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:34,800
# In roller skates and sky blue #

1596
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:41,837
# Or in the backseat watching
the slow rain fallin' #

1597
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:48,350
# I was on my way to find you #

1598
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:58,075
# I gotta find out who I'm meant to be #

1599
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:04,232
# I don't believe in destiny #

1600
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:10,796
# But with every word you swear to me #

1601
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:16,599
# All my beliefs start caving in #

1602
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:22,353
# And I feel something's #

1603
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:25,440
# About to change #

1604
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:29,277
# So bring the lightning #

1605
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:33,759
# Bring the fire, bring the fall #

1606
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:40,116
# I know I'll get my heart through #

1607
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:42,631
# Got miles to go #

1608
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:45,754
# But from the day I started crawlin' #

1609
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:51,673
# I was on my way to find you #

1610
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:59,156
# I was on my way to find you #

1611
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:07,156
# On my way #

1612
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:09,511
# Every day #

1613
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:15,637
# I was on my way to find you. #

1614
01:30:41,710 --> 01:30:43,041
Okay.

1615
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:45,437
So this is our last song, so come back in.

1616
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:47,234
Don't worry, it's a fast one.

1617
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:49,159
It's about this school,
and it's for Brother Baxter.

1618
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:50,795
Lights!

1619
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:53,800
Oh, oh, yeah, right.

1620
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:01,641
Hey! Hey!

1621
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:03,798
Leave that light switch alone.

1622
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:05,036
Didn't you hear what I told you?

1623
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:06,356
Hey!

1624
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:15,560
You think that's funny?

1625
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:21,839
Don't you push it now, d'you hear me?

1626
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:23,520
What? It's a tribute song.

1627
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:26,197
If you want to keep this band going
next term, you'd better be careful.

1628
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:27,550
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

1629
01:31:27,670 --> 01:31:28,671
Go on, Conor!

1630
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:31,111
Are you ready?

1631
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:33,672
This could be all of ours first
and last gig, man. You ready to do it?

1632
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:35,753
Let's go.

1633
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:39,714
Okay, so this is our last song.
This is called "Brown Shoes."

1634
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:42,556
And it's for every Christian Brother
and every bully you ever knew.

1635
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:12,473
# So who the hell are you
to tell me what to do? #

1636
01:32:12,590 --> 01:32:15,833
# You wear a dress and tell me
not to wear brown shoes #

1637
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:17,475
# D'you think you're man enough #

1638
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:22,039
# To wash the makeup
off my face right now? #

1639
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:24,960
# Don't you know
the bigger that they are #

1640
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:28,040
# The harder they fall? #

1641
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:31,233
# And the boot's on the other foot now #

1642
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:34,553
# Buckle up, we're takin' you down #

1643
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:38,720
# See, your curtain's fallin',
so take your bow #

1644
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:51,519
# And who the hell is he
to tell me who to be? #

1645
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:54,873
# If he wants me dancin',
he can watch on MTV #

1646
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:57,834
# You try to shut me up,
I'll turn the volume up #

1647
01:32:57,950 --> 01:33:01,113
# And drown you out #

1648
01:33:01,230 --> 01:33:03,961
# Don't you know
the bigger that they are #

1649
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:07,233
# The harder they fall? #

1650
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:10,752
# Yeah, the boot's on the other foot now #

1651
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:13,476
# Buckle up, we're takin' you down #

1652
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:19,074
# See, your curtain's fallin',
so take your bow #

1653
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:24,391
# What's gonna define
the rest of your life? #

1654
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:26,717
# Start facin' the truth #

1655
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:28,400
# You're stuck in a lie #

1656
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:33,721
# Sharp end of your knife
is pointing at you #

1657
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:35,639
# Your up'll be down #

1658
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:39,994
# Just hangin' around in gravity boots #

1659
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:46,516
# You're stuck in the past,
I'm writing the future #

1660
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:49,196
# Yeah, the boot's on the other foot now #

1661
01:33:49,310 --> 01:33:52,632
# Buckle up, we're takin' you down #

1662
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:57,517
# And your mask is slippin',
so take your bow #

1663
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:02,398
# Yeah, you had your time in the sun #

1664
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:05,639
# Does it hurt
when you're kickin' someone? #

1665
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:07,514
# 'Cause the boot's on the other foot #

1666
01:34:07,630 --> 01:34:09,200
# Boot's on the other foot #

1667
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:13,474
# Boot's on the other foot now #

1668
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:17,117
# Take a bow. #

1669
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:32,201
Thank you!

1670
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:34,278
We're Sing Street!

1671
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:39,920
That was Sing Street from Dublin.

1672
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:42,317
Shh, keep it down.

1673
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:45,592
Come in.

1674
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:46,711
Hi.

1675
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:49,401
Hey.

1676
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:50,875
Where are the parents?

1677
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:52,680
They're asleep. How was the gig?

1678
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:54,474
Great.

1679
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:55,671
Hi.

1680
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:57,121
This is Raphina?

1681
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,237
We need your help.

1682
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:00,795
Can you drive us to Dalkey?

1683
01:35:00,910 --> 01:35:02,241
What for?

1684
01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:04,796
Well, granddad's little boat
is still moored there.

1685
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:07,231
We're gonna sail to England,
the two of us.

1686
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:09,921
We're all set. We just need
a lift to the harbor.

1687
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:11,191
Yeah, sure.

1688
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:12,675
When are you thinking of going?

1689
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,474
Now.

1690
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:16,831
Now?

1691
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:19,191
Do you know anybody in England?

1692
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:21,114
- No.
- Do you have any sterling?

1693
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:22,994
No.

1694
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:25,272
- No?
- No.

1695
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:27,915
She has her photographs.

1696
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:30,920
I've my demo tapes and videos.

1697
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:34,154
Let's go. Get the keys.

1698
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:21,158
I'll see you, Mum.

1699
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:22,874
I love you.

1700
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:29,677
All right.

1701
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:06,721
Okay.

1702
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:08,360
You call as soon as you get there.

1703
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:10,279
- No messing, all right?
- I will.

1704
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:12,996
Okay.

1705
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:15,317
All right.

1706
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:18,434
Hey, uh, before you go, I...

1707
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:22,231
wrote down some song lyrics.

1708
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:23,795
- Really?
- Yeah, it's pretty

1709
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:26,875
stream of consciousness stuff,
but it's about this kid and a girl.

1710
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:28,151
In the future.

1711
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:30,312
- Put some music to it sometime.
- Okay.

1712
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:32,512
Wish I'd done this.

1713
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:35,390
You'll probably die.

1714
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:36,477
But anyway, go on.

1715
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:37,637
Go.

1716
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:41,000
You should come and visit us.

1717
01:37:41,110 --> 01:37:42,600
You seem like a mad bastard.

1718
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:44,121
Okay.

1719
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:46,831
You look after that brother of mine.
He's gonna be lost without me.

1720
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:49,521
I will.

1721
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:14,435
Call you tonight.

1722
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:15,881
Right, go on. Go on.

1723
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,674
Away.

1724
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:20,471
All right, so we're gonna go
around the island and straight on.

1725
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:22,796
- Straight to Wales.
- Okay. Straight on.

1726
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:23,997
Straight on.

1727
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:27,471
All right.

1728
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:29,001
Right.

1729
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:30,236
Forward ho.

1730
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:18,280
Yes! Yes!

1731
01:39:19,310 --> 01:39:21,153
Whoo!

1732
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:57,870
You're gonna want to sit down around now.

1733
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:01,121
Why?

1734
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:05,671
That's why.

1735
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:13,395
Oh, my God.

1736
01:40:13,510 --> 01:40:14,636
You okay?

1737
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,559
Yeah.

1738
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:17,717
Are you okay?

1739
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:19,320
Yeah.

1740
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:20,591
Conor!

1741
01:40:23,230 --> 01:40:24,117
Jesus!

1742
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:33,361
Oh, my God.
