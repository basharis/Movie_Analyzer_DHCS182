1
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,710
<i>Next subject: Kowalski, Leon.</i>

2
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,040
<i>Engineer, waste disposal.</i>

3
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,550
<i>File section: New employee, six days.</i>

4
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,920
<i>Calling Mr. Webber...</i>

5
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,930
<i>- Come in.
- ...please report to Zone A Sector 9.</i>

6
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,890
<i>Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B1 security alert.</i>

7
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,690
<i>Stand by for ID check, please.</i>

8
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,360
Sit down.

9
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,150
<i>Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B1 security alert.</i>

10
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,360
<i>Stand by for....</i>

11
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,780
Care if I talk?

12
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,160
I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

13
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,160
Just please don't move.

14
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,950
Oh, sorry.

15
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,340
I already had an IQ test.
I don't think I've had one of these.

16
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,750
Reaction time is a factor,
so pay attention.

17
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,510
Now answer as quickly as you can.

18
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,470
Sure.

19
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,140
1187 at Hunterwasser.

20
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,350
That's the hotel.

21
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,640
- What?
- Where I live.

22
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,520
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

23
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,350
Is that part of the test?

24
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,230
No. Just warming you up. That's all.

25
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,400
It's not fancy or anything.

26
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,110
You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand, when--

27
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,320
Is this the test, now?

28
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,990
Yes. You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand...

29
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,910
-  ...when you look down--
- What one?

30
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,830
- What?
- What desert?

31
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,790
Doesn't make any difference.
It's completely hypothetical.

32
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,290
- But how come I'd be there?
- Maybe you're fed up.

33
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,790
Maybe you wanna be by yourself.
Who knows?

34
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,090
You look down and see a tortoise.

35
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,880
- It's crawling towards you--
- Tortoise? What's that?

36
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,350
- You know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

37
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,100
Same thing.

38
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,890
I've never seen a turtle.

39
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,020
But I understand what you mean.

40
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,900
You reach down,
you flip the tortoise over on its back.

41
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,440
Do you make up these questions,
Mr. Holden?

42
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,740
Or do they write them down for you?

43
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,820
The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the sun...

44
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,080
...beating its legs,
trying to turn itself over, but it can't...

45
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,750
...not without your help.

46
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,160
- You're not helping.
- What do you mean I'm not?

47
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,670
I mean, you're not helping.

48
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,250
Why is that, Leon?

49
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,430
They're just questions, Leon.

50
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,970
In answer to your query,
they're written down for me.

51
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,440
It's a test designed to provoke
an emotional response.

52
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,980
Shall we continue?

53
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,950
Describe in single words only the
good things that come into your mind...

54
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,320
...about your mother.

55
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,040
- My mother?
- Yeah.

56
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,750
Let me tell you about my mother.

57
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,600
<i>A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.</i>

58
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,850
<i>The chance to begin again...</i>

59
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,070
<i>...in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.</i>

60
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,140
<i>A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.</i>

61
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,310
<i>The chance to begin again...</i>

62
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,100
<i>...in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.</i>

63
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,360
<i>The custom-tailored, genetically
engineered humanoid Replicant...</i>

64
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,780
<i>...designed especially for your needs.</i>

65
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,780
<i>So come on, America.
Let's put out....</i>

66
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,120
Give me four.

67
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,910
No, four. Two, two. Four.

68
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,840
And noodles.

69
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,770
Hey.

70
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,700
He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

71
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,110
Got the wrong guy, pal.

72
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,160
He say you Blade Runner.

73
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,790
Tell him I'm eating.

74
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,170
Captain Bryant... .

75
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,380
Bryant, huh?

76
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,860
<i>Yellow 3.</i>

77
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,730
<i>Climb and maintain 4000.</i>

78
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,210
<i>Final descent.</i>

79
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,340
<i>Now on glide path. Mark course.</i>

80
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,550
<i>Over the landing threshold.</i>

81
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,280
Hiya, Deck.

82
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,740
Bryant.

83
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,200
You wouldn't have come
if I just asked you to. Sit down, pal.

84
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,000
Come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.
I've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.

85
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,390
They jumped a shuttle Off-world,
killed the crew and passengers.

86
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,610
They found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago...

87
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,690
...so we know they're around.

88
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,240
Embarrassing.

89
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,950
No, sir, not embarrassing. No one's ever
gonna find out they're down here.

90
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,660
Because you're gonna spot them
and air them out.

91
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,120
I don't work here anymore.

92
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,540
Give it to Holden.

93
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,040
- He's good.
- I did.

94
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,710
He can breathe okay
as long as nobody unplugs him.

95
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,800
He's not good enough.
Not good as you.

96
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,550
I need you, Deck.

97
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,090
Now, this is a bad one, the worst yet.

98
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,850
I need the old Blade Runner.

99
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,600
I need your magic.

100
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,810
I was quit when I come in here, Bryant.

101
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,520
I'm twice as quit now.

102
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,570
Stop right where you are.
You know the score, pal?

103
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,530
If you're not cop, you're little people.

104
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,040
No choice, huh?

105
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,460
No choice, pal.

106
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,920
<i>I already had an IQ test this year.</i>

107
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,170
<i>I don't think I've ever
had one of these.</i>

108
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,840
<i>Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.</i>

109
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,100
<i>- Answer as quickly as you can.
- Yeah, sure.</i>

110
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,270
<i>1187 at Hunterwasser.</i>

111
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,850
<i>Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

112
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,270
<i>- What?
- Where I live.</i>

113
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,690
<i>- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.</i>

114
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,860
There was an escape from
the Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

115
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,490
Six Replicants: three male, three female.

116
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,160
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

117
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,620
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

118
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,580
No crew, no sight of them.

119
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,660
Three nights ago they tried to break
into Tyrell Corporation.

120
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,420
Two of them got fried running
through an electrical field.

121
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,500
We lost the others.

122
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,130
On the possibility they might try
to infiltrate as employees...

123
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,510
...I had Holden go over and run
Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers.

124
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,470
Looks like he got himself one.

125
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,220
<i>So you look down and you see
a tortoise. It's crawling towards you.</i>

126
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,600
<i>- Tortoise?
- That's Leon.</i>

127
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,940
Ammunition loader
on intergalactic runs.

128
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,190
He can lift 400-pound atomic loads
all day and night.

129
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,730
The only way you can hurt him
is to kill him.

130
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,320
I don't get it. What do they risk coming
back to Earth for? That's unusual. Why...?

131
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,240
What do they want
out of the Tyrell Corporation?

132
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,200
Well, you tell me, pal.
That's what you're here for.

133
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,130
- What's this?
- Nexus 6. Roy Batty.

134
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,260
Incept date: 2016.

135
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,180
Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency.

136
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,480
Probably the leader.

137
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,520
This is Zhora.

138
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,150
She's trained for
an Off-world kick murder squad.

139
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,820
Talk about Beauty and the Beast.
She's both.

140
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,830
The fourth skin-job is Pris,
a basic pleasure model.

141
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,830
The standard item for military clubs
in the outer colonies.

142
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,840
They were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions.

143
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,090
The designers reckoned
after a few years...

144
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,760
...they might develop
their own emotional responses.

145
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,350
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

146
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,730
So they built in a fail-safe device.

147
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,230
- Which is what?
- Four-year lifespan.

148
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,900
Now, there's a Nexus 6
over at the Tyrell Corporation.

149
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,280
- I want you to go put the machine on it.
- And if the machine doesn't work?

150
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,960
Do you like our owI?

151
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,220
It's artificial?

152
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,180
Of course it is.

153
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,850
Must be expensive.

154
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,560
Very. I'm Rachael.

155
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,520
Deckard.

156
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,070
It seems you feel our work
is not a benefit to the public.

157
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,200
Replicants are like any other machine:
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

158
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,120
If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.

159
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,120
May I ask you a personal question?

160
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,500
Sure.

161
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,880
Have you ever retired a human
by mistake?

162
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,260
No.

163
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,220
- But in your position, that is a risk.
- Is this to be an empathy test?

164
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,100
Capillary dilation
of the so-called blush response?

165
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,980
Fluctuation of the pupil.

166
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,980
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

167
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,320
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

168
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,620
Mr. Deckard, Dr. EIdon Tyrell.

169
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,490
Demonstrate it.

170
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,660
I wanna see it work.

171
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,460
- Where's the subject?
- I wanna see it work on a person.

172
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,540
I wanna see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.

173
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,420
What's that gonna prove?

174
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,380
Indulge me.

175
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,090
On you?

176
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,550
Try her.

177
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,180
It's too bright in here.

178
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,810
Do you mind if I smoke?

179
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,640
It won't affect the test.

180
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,980
All right, I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

181
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,570
Just relax and answer them
as simply as you can.

182
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,290
It's your birthday.
Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.

183
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,290
I wouldn't accept it.

184
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,880
AIso, I'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

185
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,300
You've got a little boy.
He shows you his butterfly collection...

186
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,300
...plus the killing jar.

187
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,350
I'd take him to the doctor.

188
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,730
You're watching television.

189
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,610
Suddenly you realize
there's a wasp crawling on your arm.

190
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,980
I'd kill it.

191
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,530
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

192
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,870
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

193
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,330
Just answer the questions, please.

194
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,420
You show it to your husband.

195
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,130
He likes it so much
he hangs it on your bedroom wall.

196
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,760
- -bush outside your window?

197
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,260
I wouldn't let him.

198
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,880
- -orange body, green legs?

199
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,390
Why not?

200
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,680
I should be enough for him.

201
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,440
One more question.

202
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,270
You're watching a stage play,
a banquet is in progress.

203
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,570
The guests are enjoying
an appetizer of raw oysters.

204
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,820
The entrée consists of boiled dog.

205
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,010
Would you step out
for a few moments, Rachael?

206
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,310
Thank you.

207
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,940
She's a Replicant, isn't she?

208
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,860
I'm impressed.

209
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,740
How many questions
does it usually take to spot one?

210
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,570
- I don't get it, Tyrell.
- How many questions?

211
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,450
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

212
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,160
It took more than a hundred for Rachael,
didn't it?

213
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,160
She doesn't know.

214
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,120
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

215
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,380
Suspect?
How can it not know what it is?

216
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,710
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

217
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,130
''More human than human'' is our motto.

218
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,970
Rachael is an experiment, nothing more.

219
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,560
We began to recognize in them
a strange obsession.

220
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,140
After all, they are emotionally
inexperienced, with only a few years...

221
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,810
...in which to store up the experiences
which you and I take for granted.

222
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,490
If we gift them with a past, we create
a cushion or a pillow for their emotions...

223
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,450
...then consequently
we can control them better.

224
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,450
Memories.

225
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,580
You're talking about memories.

226
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,380
<i>Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.</i>

227
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,510
<i>- Now answer as quickly as you can.
- Sure.</i>

228
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,300
<i>-  1187 at Hunterwasser.
- Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

229
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,680
<i>- What?
- Where I live.</i>

230
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,470
<i>- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.</i>

231
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,470
<i>- Is that part of the test?
- No.</i>

232
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,170
Kowalski.

233
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,700
Time...

234
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,080
...enough.

235
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,100
Did you get your precious photos?

236
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,100
Someone was there.

237
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,520
Men?

238
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,610
Policemen?

239
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,000
<i>Fiery the angels fell</i>

240
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,420
<i>Deep thunder rolled around their shores</i>

241
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,170
<i>Burning with the fires of Orc</i>

242
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,430
You not come here! lllegal!

243
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,980
Hey! Hey!

244
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,520
Cold! Those are my eyes! Freezing!

245
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,780
Yes.

246
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,490
Questions.

247
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,670
Hey! Hey!

248
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,270
Morphology. Longevity. Incept dates.

249
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,940
Don't know.

250
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,400
I don't know such stuff.

251
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,240
I just do eyes.

252
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,240
Just eyes, just genetic design.

253
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,240
Just eyes.

254
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,370
You Nexus, huh?

255
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,120
I design your eyes.

256
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,290
Chew...

257
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,550
...if only you could see
what I've seen with your eyes.

258
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,630
Now...

259
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,640
...questions.

260
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,890
I don't know answers.

261
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,890
Who does?

262
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,770
Tyrell.

263
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,310
He knows everything.

264
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,570
Tyrell Corporation?

265
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,780
He big boss. Big genius.
He design your mind.

266
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,820
Your brain, huh?

267
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,700
Smart.

268
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,660
Very cold.

269
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:38,420
Not an easy man to see...

270
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,670
Give me coat.

271
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,170
...I guess?

272
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,470
Sebastian.

273
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,480
He take you there.
He take you there.

274
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,190
Sebastian who?

275
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,490
J.F...

276
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,610
...Sebast... .

277
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,030
Now...

278
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,540
...where...

279
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,790
...would we find this...

280
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,340
...J.F. Sebastian?

281
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,210
<i>Let's continue, shall we?</i>

282
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,470
<i>Describe in single words...</i>

283
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:30,300
<i>...only the good things that come
into your mind about your mother.</i>

284
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,600
<i>- My mother?
- Yeah.</i>

285
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,350
<i>I'll tell you about my mother.</i>

286
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,540
<i>Voice print identification.
Your floor number, please.</i>

287
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,960
<i>- Deckard, 97.
- 97. Thank you. Danke.</i>

288
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,030
I wanted to see you.

289
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,120
So I waited.

290
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,290
Let me help you.

291
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,630
What do I need help for?

292
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,800
I don't know why
he told you what he did.

293
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,050
Talk to him.

294
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,840
He wouldn't see me.

295
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,020
You want a drink?

296
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,150
No?

297
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,910
You think I'm a Replicant, don't you?

298
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,210
Look.

299
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,760
It's me with my mother.

300
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,380
Yeah?

301
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,220
Remember when you were 6?

302
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,020
You and your brother snuck into an empty
building through a basement window.

303
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,520
You were gonna play doctor?

304
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,030
He showed you his, and when it got
to be your turn, you chickened and ran.

305
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,860
Remember that?

306
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:58,450
Did you ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody, huh?

307
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,830
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

308
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:07,000
Orange body, green legs?

309
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,920
Watched her build a web all summer?

310
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,510
Then one day, there's a big egg in it.

311
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,390
The egg hatched... .

312
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,100
- The egg hatched...
- And?

313
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,470
...and a hundred baby spiders came out.

314
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,020
And they ate her.

315
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,610
Implants.

316
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,530
Those aren't your memories,
they're somebody else's.

317
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,160
They're Tyrell's niece's.

318
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,830
Okay.

319
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,580
Bad joke.

320
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,340
I made a bad joke.

321
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,170
You're not a Replicant.

322
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,380
Go home.

323
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,220
Okay?

324
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,470
No, really. I'm sorry.

325
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,760
Go home.

326
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,860
Want a drink?

327
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,990
I'll get you a drink.

328
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,490
I'll get a glass.

329
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,090
Hey!

330
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,480
You forgot your bag.

331
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,950
I'm lost.

332
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,280
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

333
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,660
What's your name?

334
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:39,170
- Pris.
- Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

335
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,380
- Hi.
- Hi.

336
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,800
Oh, where were you going?

337
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,390
Home?

338
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,600
I don't have one.

339
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,270
We scared each other pretty good,
didn't we?

340
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,230
We sure did.

341
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,030
I'm hungry, J.F.

342
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,870
I got stuff inside.

343
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,740
You wanna come in?

344
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,250
I was hoping you'd say that.

345
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,570
Do you live in this building
all by yourself?

346
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,910
Yeah, I live here
pretty much alone right now.

347
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,080
No housing shortage around here.

348
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,670
Plenty of room for everybody.

349
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,010
Watch out for the water.

350
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,850
Must get lonely here, J.F.

351
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,610
Not really. I make friends.

352
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,150
They're toys. My friends are toys.
I make them.

353
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,650
It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer.

354
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,700
Do you know what that is?

355
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,450
No.

356
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,910
Now.

357
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,380
Yoo-hoo, home again.

358
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,180
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

359
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,430
- Good evening, J.F.
- Evening, fellas.

360
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,610
They're my friends. I made them.

361
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,610
Where are your folks?

362
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,280
I'm sort of an orphan.

363
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,660
What about your friends?

364
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,290
I have some, but I have to find them.

365
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,040
I'll let them know where I am tomorrow.

366
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,170
Can I take those things for you?
They're soaked, aren't they?

367
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,020
Enhance 224 to 176.

368
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,040
Enhance.

369
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,670
Stop.

370
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,270
Move in.

371
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,060
Stop.

372
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,520
Pull out, track right.

373
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,480
Stop.

374
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:58,150
Center and pull back.

375
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,160
Stop.

376
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,040
Track 45 right.

377
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,210
Stop.

378
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:10,170
Center and stop.

379
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:19,130
Enhance 34 to 36.

380
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:31,350
Pan right and pull back.

381
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,770
Stop.

382
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,950
Enhance 34 to 46.

383
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
Pull back.

384
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,000
Wait a minute. Go right.

385
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,090
Stop.

386
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,930
Enhance 57-19.

387
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,850
Track 45 left.

388
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,350
Stop.

389
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,770
Enhance 15 to 23.

390
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,040
Give me a hard copy right there.

391
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,390
Fish?

392
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:44,740
I think it was manufactured locally.

393
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:54,000
Finest quality. Superior workmanship.

394
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,080
There is the maker's serial number.

395
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:03,800
9906947-XB71.

396
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:05,880
Interesting.

397
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:10,930
Not fish. Snake scale.

398
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,510
Snake.

399
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,350
Try Abdul Ben Hassan.
He make this snake!

400
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,790
Abdul Hassan?

401
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:25,210
I'm a police officer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

402
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,470
Artificial snake license XB71, that's you?

403
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,300
This is your work, huh?
Who did you sell it to?

404
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:35,180
My work? Not too many
could afford such quality.

405
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:36,470
How many?

406
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,850
- Very few.
- How few?

407
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,690
- Look, my friend--
- Taffey Lewis' .

408
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:44,320
Down in Fourth Sector, Chinatown.

409
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,650
<i>Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.</i>

410
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:54,280
<i>Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.</i>

411
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,490
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

412
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:22,650
Bartender.

413
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,150
Taffey Lewis?

414
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,440
Thank you.

415
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,320
- Taffey?
- Yeah?

416
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,200
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

417
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:40,160
Blow.

418
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,170
You ever buy snakes
from the Egyptian, Taffey?

419
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:45,750
All the time, pal.

420
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:49,920
You ever see this girl, huh?

421
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,930
Never seen her. Buzz off.

422
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,930
Your licenses in order, pal?

423
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,220
Hey, Louie.

424
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:01,980
The man is dry. Give him one
on the house, okay? See?

425
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:46,020
Hello?

426
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,530
I've had people walk out on me before,
but not when...

427
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,900
...I was being so charming.

428
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:58,120
I'm in a bar, here now,
down in the Fourth Sector.

429
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,660
Taffey Lewis is on the line.

430
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,040
Why don't you come on down here
and have a drink?

431
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,750
<i>I don't think so, Mr. Deckard.</i>

432
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,290
<i>That's not my kind of place.</i>

433
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,000
Go someplace else?

434
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,480
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

435
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:34,900
<i>... Taffey Lewis presents
Miss Salome and the snake.</i>

436
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:39,450
<i>Watch her take the pleasure
from the serpent...</i>

437
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,370
<i>... that once corrupted man.</i>

438
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,330
Excuse me, Miss Salome,
can I talk to you for a minute?

439
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,630
I'm from the American Federation
of Variety Artists.

440
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:33,840
Oh, yeah?

441
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,800
I'm not here to make you join.
No, ma'am. That's not my department.

442
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,840
Actually...

443
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:46,430
...I'm from the Confidential Committee
on Moral Abuses.

444
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,230
Committee of Moral Abuses?

445
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,560
There's been reports
that the management...

446
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,900
...has been taking liberties
with the artists.

447
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,520
I don't know nothing about it.

448
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,690
Have you felt yourself to be
exploited in any way?

449
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,320
How do you mean ''exploited''?

450
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:04,030
Well, like to get this job.

451
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,120
I mean, did you do, or were you
asked to do, anything that's...

452
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,500
...lewd or unsavory or...

453
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:15,540
...otherwise repulsive
to your person, huh?

454
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,130
- Are you for real?
- Oh, yeah.

455
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,550
I'd like to check
your dressing room, if I may.

456
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,430
- For what?
- For holes.

457
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,640
Holes?

458
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:31,600
Well, you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through...

459
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,610
...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

460
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,900
No, I wouldn't.

461
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:41,200
Little...

462
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:46,830
...dirty holes they drill in the wall
so they can watch a lady undress.

463
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,530
- Is this a real snake?
- Of course it's not real.

464
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,830
Think I'd be working in a place like this
if I could afford a real snake?

465
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,930
So if somebody does try to exploit me,
who do I go to about it?

466
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:49,260
- Me.
- You're a dedicated man. Dry me.

467
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,460
The only thing they care about--

468
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,790
Hey!

469
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,260
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

470
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,590
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

471
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,470
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

472
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,560
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

473
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:01,060
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

474
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,860
<i>Don't walk. Don't walk.</i>

475
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,150
<i>Don't walk. Don't walk.</i>

476
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,360
<i>Don't walk. Don't walk. Don't walk.</i>

477
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,130
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

478
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,300
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

479
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,720
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

480
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:36,430
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

481
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,180
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

482
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:40,180
Move! Get out of the way!

483
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,080
Deckard.

484
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,840
B26354.

485
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:39,090
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

486
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,510
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

487
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,890
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

488
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,270
A minute.

489
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,070
Yeah, what do you want?

490
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,030
Tsingtao.

491
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,120
This enough?

492
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,790
Yeah.

493
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,300
Bryant.

494
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,160
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

495
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,580
I'm going home.

496
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,660
Could learn from this guy, Gaff.

497
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:49,620
He's a goddamn one-man
slaughterhouse, that's what he is.

498
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,170
Four more to go.

499
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:54,090
- Come on, Gaff, let's go.
- Three.

500
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,550
There's three to go.

501
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:00,430
There's four.

502
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,430
That skin-job you VK'd
at the Tyrell Corporation...

503
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,470
...Rachael, disappeared, vanished.
Didn't even know she was a Replicant.

504
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,520
Something to do with a brain implant,
says Tyrell.

505
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:14,020
Come on, Gaff.
Drink some for me, huh, pal?

506
01:01:58,650 --> 01:01:59,690
Leon.

507
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,570
How old am I?

508
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,580
I don't know.

509
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:13,080
My birthday's April 10, 2017.
How long do I live?

510
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,040
Four years.

511
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:23,300
More than you.

512
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:31,060
Painful to live in fear, isn't it?

513
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:39,860
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

514
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,240
I agree.

515
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,330
Wake up. Time to die.

516
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,330
Shakes?

517
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,500
Me too.

518
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,380
I get them bad.

519
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:49,140
It's part of the business.

520
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,770
I'm not in the business.

521
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:13,540
I am the business.

522
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,710
What if I go north?

523
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,840
Disappear.

524
01:05:58,270 --> 01:05:59,600
Would you come after me?

525
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,440
Hunt me?

526
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:09,820
No.

527
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,490
No, I wouldn't.

528
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,410
I owe you one.

529
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,930
But somebody would.

530
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,200
Deckard...

531
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:57,830
...you know those files on me?

532
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,790
The incept date. The longevity.

533
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,870
Those things.

534
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:08,040
You saw them?

535
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,220
They're...

536
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,590
...classified.

537
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,260
But you're a policeman.

538
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:19,510
I...

539
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,640
...didn't look at them.

540
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:25,980
You know,
that Voight-Kampff test of yours...

541
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,980
...did you ever take that test yourself?

542
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,540
Deckard.

543
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,560
I dreamt music.

544
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:23,360
I didn't know if I could play.

545
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:27,790
I remember lessons.

546
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:32,620
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

547
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:39,550
You play beautifully.

548
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,080
Now you kiss me.

549
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,960
I can't rely on my--

550
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,750
Say, ''Kiss me. ''

551
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,380
Kiss me.

552
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:15,770
I want you.

553
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:20,400
I want you.

554
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,150
Again.

555
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,190
I want you.

556
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,780
Put your hands on me.

557
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:54,910
- What you doing?
- I'm sorry. Just peeking.

558
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:01,920
- How do I look?
- You look better.

559
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,130
- Just better?
- Well...

560
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:06,550
...you look beautiful.

561
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,840
Thanks.

562
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:20,180
How old are you?

563
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,150
Twenty-five.

564
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:27,230
- What's your problem?
- Methuselah syndrome.

565
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,730
What's that?

566
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,900
My glands, they grow old too fast.

567
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:37,330
- Is that why you're still on Earth?
- Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

568
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,540
Anyway...

569
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,170
...I kind of like it here.

570
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:47,800
I like you...

571
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,210
...just the way you are.

572
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:54,260
Hi, Roy.

573
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:55,840
Hi.

574
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:57,720
Gosh, you...

575
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:00,180
...really got some nice toys here.

576
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,730
This is the friend I was telling you about.

577
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:06,110
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

578
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,770
Sebastian.

579
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,150
I like a man that stays put.

580
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:16,030
You live here all by yourself, do you?

581
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,240
Yes.

582
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:31,170
How about some breakfast?

583
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:33,300
I was just gonna make some.

584
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:34,510
Excuse me.

585
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:43,520
Well?

586
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:47,020
Leon... .

587
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:49,190
What's going on?

588
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:55,200
There's only two of us now.

589
01:15:57,410 --> 01:16:00,490
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

590
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,750
No, we won't.

591
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,280
No.

592
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:43,950
Knight takes queen, see?

593
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,040
Won't do.

594
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:56,510
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

595
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:58,050
Because...

596
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,390
...you're so different.

597
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:04,010
You're so perfect.

598
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,770
Yes.

599
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:11,060
What generation are you?

600
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,410
Nexus 6.

601
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:22,830
I knew it.

602
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:26,250
Because I do genetic design work
for the Tyrell Corporation.

603
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:28,620
There's some of me in you.

604
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:31,460
Show me something.

605
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:33,380
Like what?

606
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,460
Like anything.

607
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:42,090
We're no computers, Sebastian.
We're physical.

608
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:46,140
I think, Sebastian...

609
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:48,730
...therefore, I am.

610
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:52,190
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.

611
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:20,840
We've got a lot in common.

612
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:23,260
- What do you mean?
- Similar problems.

613
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:26,220
Accelerated decrepitude.

614
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,890
I don't know much about bio-mechanics,
Roy. I wish I did.

615
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:35,480
If we don't find help soon...

616
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:38,570
...Pris hasn't got long to live.

617
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:40,490
We can't allow that.

618
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:45,910
- Is he good?
- Who?

619
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,450
- Your opponent.
- Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

620
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:53,080
I've only beaten him once in chess.
He's a genius.

621
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,380
He designed you.

622
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,380
Maybe he could help.

623
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:04,090
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

624
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:09,680
Better if I talk to him in person.

625
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:17,860
But I understand
he's a sort of hard man to get to.

626
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,980
Yes.

627
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:21,780
Very.

628
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:27,120
Will you help us?

629
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:29,160
I can't.

630
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:31,330
We need you, Sebastian.

631
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,370
You're our best and only friend.

632
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:49,850
We're so happy you found us.

633
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,770
I don't think
there's another human being...

634
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:56,230
...in the whole world
who would've helped us.

635
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:48,780
66,000 Prosser & Ankovich.

636
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,410
Trade.

637
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,330
<i>- Trade at two--
- Blue entry.</i>

638
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:58,710
<i>A Mr. J.F. Sebastian.</i>

639
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:02,960
<i>16417.</i>

640
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,510
<i>At this hour?</i>

641
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:08,840
<i>What can I do for you, Sebastian?</i>

642
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:13,470
Queen to bishop six. Check.

643
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:21,270
Nonsense.

644
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,690
Just a moment.

645
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:31,320
Queen to bishop six, ridiculous.

646
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:38,710
Queen...

647
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:42,380
...bishop six.

648
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,840
<i>Knight...</i>

649
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:52,260
<i>... takes queen.</i>

650
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,480
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

651
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,110
What are you thinking about?

652
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:06,940
Bishop to king seven.

653
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:09,150
Checkmate.

654
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,360
Bishop to king seven.
Checkmate, I think.

655
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,450
Got a brainstorm, huh, Sebastian?

656
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:19,540
Milk and cookies kept you awake, huh?

657
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:21,870
<i>Let's discuss this.</i>

658
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,040
<i>You better come up, Sebastian.</i>

659
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,650
Mr. Tyrell?

660
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,110
I... .

661
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:49,190
I brought a friend.

662
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:59,450
I'm surprised
you didn't come here sooner.

663
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,250
It's not an easy thing
to meet your maker.

664
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:12,930
And what can he do for you?

665
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:17,180
Can the maker repair what he makes?

666
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:20,680
Would you like to be modified?

667
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:22,810
Stay here.

668
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:31,360
Had in mind something
a little more radical.

669
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,950
What...?

670
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:36,620
What seems to be the problem?

671
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:39,580
- Death.
- Death.

672
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:43,330
Well, I'm afraid that's
a little out of my jurisdiction. You--

673
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,460
I want more life...

674
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:47,920
...father.

675
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,970
The facts of life.

676
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:59,180
To make an alteration in the...

677
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:01,770
...evolvement of
an organic life system is fatal.

678
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:05,520
A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.

679
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:06,730
Why not?

680
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,900
Because by the second day
of incubation...

681
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:13,570
...any cells that have undergone
reversion mutations...

682
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:17,990
...give rise to revertant colonies
like rats leaving a sinking ship.

683
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,950
Then the ship sinks.

684
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:23,660
What about EMS recombination?

685
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:25,370
We've already tried it.

686
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:29,840
Ethyl methane sulfonate is an
alkylating agent and a potent mutagen.

687
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,130
It created a virus so lethal the...

688
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,470
...subject was dead
before he left the table.

689
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:39,720
Then a repressor protein
that blocks the operating cells.

690
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:43,850
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

691
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:48,730
So that the newly formed DNA strand
carries a mutation...

692
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:51,770
...and you've got a virus again.

693
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:56,400
But this, all of this, is...

694
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:58,160
...academic.

695
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,820
You were made
as well as we could make you.

696
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:02,740
But not to last.

697
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:06,750
The light that burns twice as bright
burns half as long.

698
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:11,130
And you have burned
so very, very brightly, Roy.

699
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:13,500
Look at you.

700
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:16,220
You're the prodigal son.

701
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:19,930
You're quite a prize.

702
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,100
I've done...

703
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:28,890
...questionable things.

704
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,980
AIso extraordinary things.

705
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,980
Revel in your time.

706
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:42,450
Nothing the god of biomechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

707
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:37,420
Sorry, Sebastian.

708
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,760
Come. Come.

709
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:32,020
<i>Body identified with Tyrell

714
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:52,790
<i>- I'm working. What are you doing?
- Arresting you, that's what I'm doing.</i>

715
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:57,670
I'm Deckard, Blade Runner.
26354. I'm filed and monitored.

716
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,090
<i>Hold on. Checking.</i>

717
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:06,970
<i>Okay. Checked and cleared.
Have a better one.</i>

718
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,520
<i>- Hello.
- Hi. Is J.F. there?</i>

719
01:28:19,690 --> 01:28:23,110
<i>- Who is it?
- This is Eddie, old friend of J.F.'s.</i>

720
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:28,700
That's no way to treat a friend.

721
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:29,340
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

722
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:33,470
Good evening, J.F.

723
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,480
<i>Tea?</i>

724
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:48,610
<i>More tea?</i>

725
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:50,730
<i>Tea?</i>

726
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:02,450
<i>More tea?</i>

727
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:06,170
<i>Tea?</i>

728
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:09,630
<i>More tea?</i>

729
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:13,220
<i>More tea?</i>

730
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,480
<i>More tea?</i>

731
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:36,880
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

732
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:41,840
I thought you were
supposed to be good.

733
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:45,840
Aren't you the good man?

734
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:54,270
Come on, Deckard.

735
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,360
Show me...

736
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:00,320
...what you're made of.

737
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:14,210
Proud of yourself, little man?

738
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:23,920
This is for Zhora.

739
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:26,840
This is for Pris.

740
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:35,520
Come on, Deckard.

741
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:39,270
I'm right here,
but you've gotta shoot straight.

742
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:42,990
Straight doesn't seem
to be good enough!

743
01:36:43,150 --> 01:36:44,240
Now it's my turn.

744
01:36:46,110 --> 01:36:49,830
I'm gonna give you a few seconds
before I come.

745
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:51,830
One.

746
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:54,160
Two.

747
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:08,050
Three.

748
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:10,140
Four.

749
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,110
Pris.

750
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:39,060
I'm coming.

751
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:41,020
Deckard!

752
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,730
<i>Four, five</i>

753
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:51,160
<i>How to stay alive?</i>

754
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:15,680
I can see you!

755
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,790
Not yet!

756
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,000
Not... .

757
01:40:17,780 --> 01:40:19,540
Five.

758
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:24,330
Five.

759
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:29,710
Yes.

760
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:39,100
You better get it up.

761
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:41,270
Or I'm gonna have to kill you.

762
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:44,560
Unless you're alive, you can't play.

763
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:46,690
And if you don't play... .

764
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,530
<i>Six, seven</i>

765
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:00,620
<i>Go to hell or go to heaven</i>

766
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,790
Good, that's the spirit!

767
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:53,300
That hurt.

768
01:41:56,590 --> 01:41:58,720
That was irrational of you.

769
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,010
Not to mention...

770
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:05,020
...unsportsmanlike.

771
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:11,060
Where are you going?

772
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:19,420
Quite an experience to live in fear,
isn't it?

773
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:24,170
That's what it is to be a slave.

774
01:46:23,070 --> 01:46:24,360
I've...

775
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:29,570
...seen things
you people wouldn't believe.

776
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:36,330
Attack ships on fire
off the shoulder of Orion.

777
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:40,580
I watched C-beams...

778
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:44,460
...glitter in the dark
near the Tannhäuser Gate.

779
01:46:48,630 --> 01:46:50,680
All those...

780
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,890
...moments will be lost...

781
01:46:54,050 --> 01:46:56,310
...in time...

782
01:46:57,850 --> 01:47:00,100
...like...

783
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:02,020
...tears...

784
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:05,690
...in rain.

785
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,860
Time to die.

786
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:20,720
You've done a man's job, sir.

787
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,770
I guess you're through, huh?

788
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:32,610
Finished.

789
01:48:54,630 --> 01:48:57,640
It's too bad she won't live.

790
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:01,140
But then again, who does?

791
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:36,630
Rachael?

792
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:46,060
Rachael?

793
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:01,530
Rachael?

794
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:10,060
Do you love me?

795
01:51:11,190 --> 01:51:12,940
I love you.

796
01:51:13,810 --> 01:51:15,690
Do you trust me?

797
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,860
I trust you.

798
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:29,960
Rachael?

799
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:12,410
<i>It's too bad she won't live.</i>

800
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:15,210
<i>But then again, who does?</i>
