0
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,302
The Hovitos are near.

1
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,934
The poison is still fresh,
three days.

2
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,633
They're following us.

3
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,638
If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.

4
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,223
This is it.

5
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,858
This is where Forrestal
cashed in.

6
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,197
A friend of yours?

7
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,202
A competitor.

8
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,569
He was good.

9
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,232
He was very, very good.

10
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:06,176
Senor... nobody's
come out of there alive.

11
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,214
Please...

12
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,485
Senor.

13
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,746
Stop.

14
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,841
Stay out of the light.

15
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,574
Forrestal.

16
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,580
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

17
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,428
That's what scares me.

18
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,276
Stay here.

19
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,317
If you insist, senor.

20
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,832
Give me the whip.

21
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,202
Throw me the idol.

22
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,008
No time to argue.

23
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,341
Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip.

24
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,879
Give me the whip!

25
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,574
Adios, senor.

26
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,716
Adios, Satipo.

27
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,567
Dr. Jones.

28
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,503
Again we see there is nothing
you can possess

29
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,199
which I cannot take away.

30
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,435
And you thought I had given up.

31
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,578
You chose the wrong friends.

32
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,920
This time, it will cost you.

33
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,157
Too bad the Hovitos...

34
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,460
don't know you the way I do,
Belloq.

35
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,090
Yes, too bad.

36
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,328
You could warn them,

37
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,031
if only you spoke Hovitos.

38
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,215
Jock! Start the engines!

39
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,914
Get it up!

40
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,589
Jock, the engines!

41
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,926
Start the engines, Jock!

42
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,843
There's a big snake
in the plane, Jock!

43
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,714
Oh, that's just
my pet snake Reggie!

44
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,050
I hate snakes, Jock!

45
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,248
I hate 'em!

46
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,656
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?

47
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,472
''Neo,'' meaning ''new''

48
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:02,139
and ''lithic''... l-T-H...

49
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,911
...l-C, meaning ''stone.''

50
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,611
All right, let's get back
to this site:

51
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,915
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.

52
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:14,152
Contains a central pas-passage
and three chambers, or cysts...

53
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:22,523
...don't confuse that with
robbing, in which case we mean

54
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,570
the removal of the contents
of the barrow.

55
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,538
This site also demonstrates...

56
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,109
...one of the great dangers
of archaeology--

57
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,375
not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place--

58
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,847
no, I'm talking about folklore.

59
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,612
In this case,
local tradition held

60
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,176
that there was golden coffin
buried at the site,

61
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,781
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow

62
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,725
and the generally poor condition
of the find.

63
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,729
However, chamber three
was undisturbed,

64
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,822
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods

65
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,298
that were found in another, uh--

66
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,699
in the area, give us a r--

67
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,365
Uh...

68
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,432
...reason to da--
to, uh, to-to date this,

69
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,137
uh, find as we have.

70
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,179
Um...

71
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,182
Any questions, then?

72
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,046
No? Okay, that's it
for the day, then.

73
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,379
Um, don't forget--

74
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:18,287
Michaelson, chapters four
and five for next time.

75
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,450
And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

76
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,532
I had it, Marcus.

77
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,232
I had it in my hand.

78
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,534
What happened?

79
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,235
Guess.

80
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,501
Belloq?

81
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:40,670
You want to hear about it?

82
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,145
Not at all.

83
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,148
I'm sure everything you do
for the museum

84
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,911
conforms to
the International Treaty

85
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,350
for the Protection
of Antiquities.

86
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,909
It's beautiful, Marcus.

87
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:49,920
I can get it.

88
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,047
I got it all figured out.

89
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,681
There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.

90
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:53,850
I need $2,000. Look--

91
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:54,858
Listen to me, old boy.

92
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,326
I brought some people
to see you.

93
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,327
Look.

94
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,488
I got these pieces.

95
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,088
They're good pieces, Marcus.

96
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,190
-Look.
-Indiana...

97
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,203
Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.

98
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,829
Yes, they are nice.
They're worth at least

99
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,237
the price
of a ticket to Marrakech.

100
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,501
But the people
I brought are important,

101
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,507
and they're waiting.

102
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,508
What people?

103
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,442
Army Intelligence.

104
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,002
They knew you were coming
before I did.

105
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,342
Seem to know everything.

106
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,406
They wouldn't tell me
what they want.

107
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,918
Well, what do I want
to see them for?

108
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,544
What am I, in trouble?

109
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,815
Yes, Dr. Jones,

110
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,356
we've heard a great deal
about you.

111
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,221
Have you?

112
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,488
Uh, professor of archaeology,

113
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,028
expert on the occult,

114
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,223
and, uh, how does one say it?

115
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,927
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

116
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:36,932
That's one way of saying it.

117
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:37,933
Why don't you sit down?

118
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,934
You'll be more comfortable.

119
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,038
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

120
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,404
Yes, you're a man
of many talents.

121
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,841
Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood

122
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,572
at the University of Chicago.

123
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,614
Yes, I did.

124
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,412
You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?

125
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,647
Uh... well, just rumors, really.

126
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,382
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

127
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,117
I haven't really spoken
to him for ten years.

128
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,749
We were friends, but, uh...

129
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,727
had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.

130
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,263
Mmm.

131
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,891
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand

132
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,059
that this is all
strictly confidential, eh?

133
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,068
I understand.

134
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,264
Uh...

135
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,901
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections

136
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,741
intercepted a...
a German communiqué

137
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,873
that was sent
from Cairo to Berlin.

138
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,780
-Now, to Cairo...
-See, over the last two years,

139
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,614
the Nazis have had teams
of archaeologists

140
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,744
running around the world

141
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,018
looking for all kinds
of religious artifacts.

142
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,422
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

143
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,424
He's crazy.

144
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,552
He's obsessed with the occult.

145
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,493
And, right now, apparently,

146
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,896
there's some kind
of German archaeological dig

147
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,399
going on in the desert
outside of Cairo.

148
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,698
Now, we've got some
information here,

149
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,295
but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.

150
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:51,207
''Tanis development proceeding.

151
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,542
''Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

152
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,947
Abner Ravenwood, U.S.''

153
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,246
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

154
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,585
Just what does that mean to you,
uh, Tanis?

155
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:05,623
Well, it--

156
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,090
The city of Tanis
is one of the possible

157
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,217
resting places of the Lost Ark.

158
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,885
The Lost Ark?

159
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,257
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

160
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,388
The chest the Hebrews used

161
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,897
to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

162
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,398
What do you mean,
''commandments''?

163
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,866
You talking
about the Ten Commandments?

164
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,459
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

165
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,765
The original stone tablets

166
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,500
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

167
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,065
if you believe
in that sort of thing.

168
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,476
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

169
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,478
Well, I...

170
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,536
Oh, look.

171
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,207
The Hebrews took
the broken pieces

172
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,443
and put them in the Ark.

173
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,815
When they settled in Canaan,

174
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,377
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

175
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,422
In Jerusalem.

176
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,116
Where it stayed for many years.

177
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,523
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

178
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,525
Where?

179
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,494
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

180
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,428
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

181
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,522
-Shishak.
-Yes.

182
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,363
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

183
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,405
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

184
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,406
and hidden it
in a secret chamber

185
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,941
called the Well of Souls.

186
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,407
Secret chamber?

187
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,069
However, about a year

188
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,545
after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,

189
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,811
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

190
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,876
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

191
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,547
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

192
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,691
Uh-huh.

193
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,160
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

194
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,787
Now you seem to know, uh,

195
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:19,990
all about this Tanis, then.

196
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,726
No, no, not really.

197
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,394
Ravenwood is the real expert.

198
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,903
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

199
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,495
Collected some of its relics.

200
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,270
It was his obsession, really.

201
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,867
But he never found the city.

202
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,346
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

203
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,042
An American being mentioned
so prominently

204
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,347
in a secret Nazi cable.

205
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,386
Oh, rubbish.

206
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,750
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

207
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,721
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

208
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,883
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking

209
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,927
for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra

210
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,585
and they think Abner's got it.

211
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:54,098
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

212
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,565
Well, the staff
is just a stick--

213
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,862
I don't know, about this big,

214
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,562
nobody really knows
for sure how high--

215
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,606
and it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

216
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,369
with an elaborate headpiece...

217
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,469
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

218
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,207
And what you did was

219
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,715
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis--

220
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,148
a map room with a miniature

221
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,879
of the city all laid out
on the floor--

222
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,181
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

223
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,986
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

224
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,891
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

225
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,897
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

226
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,832
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

227
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,369
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

228
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,496
What does this Ark look like?

229
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,904
Uh...

230
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,839
There's a picture of it
right here.

231
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,244
That's it.

232
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,183
Good God.

233
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,691
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

234
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,920
Uh...

235
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,496
now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

236
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,555
Lightning...

237
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,600
fire...

238
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,727
power of God or something.

239
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,699
I'm beginning to understand

240
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:08,933
Hitler's interest in this.

241
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,668
Oh, yes.

242
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,642
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

243
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,203
and laying waste
to entire regions.

244
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:20,377
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

245
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,612
is invincible.

246
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,902
You did it, didn't you?

247
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,467
They want you to go for it.

248
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,979
Oh, Marcus!

249
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,743
They want you to get ahold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

250
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,978
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

251
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,246
And the museum?

252
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,582
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

253
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,020
Oh, yes.

254
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,086
Oh...

255
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,651
The Ark of the Covenant.

256
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,426
Nothing else has come close.

257
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,898
That thing represents everything

258
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,128
we got into archaeology
for in the first place.

259
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,099
Mmm!

260
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:18,142
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.

261
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,371
I'm really rather envious.

262
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,810
I've got to locate Abner.

263
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,541
I think I know where to start.

264
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,915
Suppose she'll
still be with him?

265
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,320
Possibly, but...

266
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,053
Marion's the least
of your worries right now,

267
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,754
believe me, Indy.

268
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,819
What do you mean?

269
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,957
Well, I mean that
for nearly 3,000 years,

270
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,864
man has been searching
for the Lost Ark.

271
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:49,737
Not something to be taken
lightly.

272
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,767
No one knows its secrets.

273
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:57,212
It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.

274
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,643
Oh, Marcus.

275
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:00,912
What are you trying to do,
scare me?

276
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:01,917
You sound like my mother.

277
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,419
We've known each other
for a long time.

278
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,420
I don't believe in magic,

279
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,582
a lot of superstitious
hocus-pocus.

280
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,750
I'm going after a find

281
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,760
of incredible
historical significance.

282
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,591
You're talking
about the bogeyman.

283
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,791
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

284
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,841
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.

285
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:27,879
Thank you.

286
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,851
Shh... shh...

287
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,668
Shh...

288
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,506
Give him space!
Give him space!

289
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,973
Go on, Regan!

290
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,077
Shh! Shh!

291
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,579
Shh! Shh! Shh!

292
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,723
Hello, Marion.

293
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,428
Indiana Jones.

294
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,030
Always knew, someday,

295
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,507
you'd come walking back
through my door.

296
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,635
I never doubted that.

297
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,941
Something made it inevitable.

298
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,881
So, what are you doing here
in Nepal?

299
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,942
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

300
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,784
I learned to hate you
in the last ten years.

301
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,586
I never meant to hurt you.

302
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:01,819
I was a child.

303
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,087
I was in love.

304
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,992
It was wrong and you knew it!

305
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,325
You knew what you were doing.

306
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:06,887
Now I do!

307
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,090
This is my place.

308
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,224
Get out!

309
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,302
I did what I did.

310
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,736
You don't have to be happy
about it,

311
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,535
but maybe we could help
each other out now.

312
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,834
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

313
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,106
Bronze piece, about this size,

314
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,080
with a hole in it, off-center,
with a crystal.

315
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,275
You know the one I mean?

316
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,250
Yeah.

317
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,547
I know it.

318
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,644
Where's Abner?

319
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,622
Where's Abner?

320
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,885
Abner's dead.

321
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,698
Marion, I'm sorry.

322
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,701
Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?

323
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,237
I can only say
I'm sorry so many times.

324
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,068
Well, say it again, anyway.

325
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,164
Sorry.

326
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,936
Yeah, everybody's sorry.

327
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,876
Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth

328
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,937
looking
for his little bits of junk.

329
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,347
I'm sorry to still be
stuck in this dive.

330
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,045
Everybody's sorry for something.

331
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,111
It's a worthless bronze
medallion, Marion.

332
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,451
You going to give it to me?

333
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,547
Maybe.

334
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,388
I don't know where it is.

335
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,896
Well, maybe you could find it.

336
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,431
3,000 bucks.

337
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:18,333
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

338
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:21,236
I can get you another two
when we get to the States.

339
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,433
It's important, Marion.

340
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,635
Trust me.

341
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,679
You know the piece I mean?

342
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,374
Do you know where it is?

343
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,342
Come back tomorrow.

344
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,513
Why?

345
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:41,355
Because I said so, that's why.

346
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,126
Ha!

347
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,293
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

348
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,002
Good evening, Fraulein.

349
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,199
The bar's closed.

350
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:06,300
We... We are...

351
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,311
not thirsty.

352
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,710
What do you want?

353
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,750
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.

354
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,377
Surely he told you
there would be

355
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,080
other interested parties.

356
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,646
Must've slipped his mind.

357
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:23,319
The man is... nefarious.

358
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:27,660
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

359
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,996
Why, are you willing
to offer more?

360
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:33,003
Oh, almost certainly.

361
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,868
Do you still have it?

362
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,042
No.

363
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,946
But I know where it is.

364
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,847
Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?

365
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,880
Your fire is dying here.

366
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,688
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

367
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,888
Listen, Herr Mac...

368
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,658
I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with,

369
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,169
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

370
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,604
Fraulein Ravenwood,

371
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:13,508
let me show you
what I am used to.

372
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,980
Take your hands off me!

373
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,979
Take your lousy hands off!

374
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,385
Wait a minute.

375
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,758
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.

376
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,060
That time is passed.

377
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,759
You don't need that.

378
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:38,861
Wait...

379
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,972
I'll tell you everything.

380
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:46,339
Yes, I know you will.

381
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,173
Let her go.

382
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,159
Whiskey.

383
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,733
Shoot them.

384
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,533
Shoot them both.

385
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,891
My medallion!

386
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,104
Well, Jones, at least
you haven't forgotten

387
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,935
how to show a lady a good time!

388
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,598
Boy, you're something!

389
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,768
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

390
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,778
Until I get back my $5,000,

391
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,939
you're going to get more
than you bargained for.

392
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,143
I'm your goddamn partner!

393
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,686
Cairo, city of the living.

394
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,486
A paradise on earth.

395
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,487
Silence!

396
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,086
Why do you forget yourselves?

397
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,153
What is this?

398
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,699
Where did this animal come from?

399
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,132
Oh... oh, no.

400
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,168
Cute.

401
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,233
What an adorable creature.

402
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,339
Then it shall be welcome
in our house.

403
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,940
Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.

404
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,323
I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.

405
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,454
You're the best digger in Egypt.

406
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,159
My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.

407
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:06,465
They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.

408
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,266
The excavation is enormous.

409
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,298
They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.

410
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,539
It's as if the pharaohs
had returned.

411
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,240
When did they find the map room?

412
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,907
Three days ago.

413
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,883
They have not one brain
among them.

414
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,284
Except one.

415
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,447
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.

416
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,152
What's his name?

417
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,524
They call him ''Bellosh.''

418
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,868
Belloq. Belloq.

419
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,735
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

420
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,935
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

421
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:50,446
Well, they're not
going to find it without this.

422
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,211
Who can tell us
about these markings?

423
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,453
Perhaps a man I know
can help us.

424
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,381
Indy...

425
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,991
there is something
that troubles me.

426
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:09,032
What is it?

427
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,091
The Ark.

428
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,467
If it is there, at Tanis,

429
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,871
then it is something that man
was not meant to disturb.

430
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,910
Death has always surrounded it.

431
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,308
It is not of this earth.

432
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,109
Do we need the monkey, huh?

433
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,479
I'm surprised at you, Jones--

434
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,178
talking that way about our baby.

435
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,844
He's got your looks, too.

436
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:30,910
And your brains.

437
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,853
Oops!

438
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,016
I noticed that.

439
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,616
She's a smart little thing--
smart.

440
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,591
Hey!

441
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,893
Hey, where you going?

442
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,695
She'll be all right.
Have a date.

443
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,798
Come on. Come on.

444
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,805
Okay...

445
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,806
Marion.

446
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,864
What's this?

447
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,308
It's a date.

448
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,844
You eat 'em.

449
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,127
How come you haven't found some
nice girl to settle down with,

450
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,131
raise eight or nine kids,
like your friend Sallah?

451
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,223
Who says I haven't?

452
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,394
I do.

453
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,404
Dad had you figured
a long time ago.

454
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:04,976
He said you were a bum.

455
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,482
Oh, he's being generous.

456
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,541
The most gifted bum
he ever trained.

457
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,519
You know, he loved you
like a son.

458
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,556
Took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him.

459
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,783
Not much, just you.

460
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,136
Marion, get out of here!

461
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,177
Duck!

462
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,821
Right.

463
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,165
Shh! Shh!

464
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,699
Marion!

465
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,962
Help! Over here, Indy!

466
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,688
Get out of the way!

467
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,163
Move! Move it!

468
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,758
Help me!

469
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,500
You can't do this to me!

470
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,406
I'm an American!

471
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,240
Indy!

472
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,515
Indiana Jones!

473
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,881
Help me, Jones!

474
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:16,705
Jones!

475
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:17,741
Marion!

476
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,608
Indy!

477
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,117
Marion...

478
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,591
Dr. Jones.

479
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,687
You looking for me?

480
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,229
Belloq.

481
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:26,769
Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.

482
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,771
I ought to kill you right now.

483
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,433
Not a very private place
for a murder.

484
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:35,306
Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.

485
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:38,507
They're not going
to interfere in our business.

486
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:41,449
It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.

487
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,611
Please, sit down
before you fall down.

488
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:46,281
We can at least behave
like civilized people.

489
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,328
I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.

490
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:02,429
How odd that it should end
this way for us,

491
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:05,441
after so many
stimulating encounters.

492
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:07,306
I almost regret it.

493
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:08,902
Where shall I find
a new adversary

494
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,913
so close to my own level?

495
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,983
Try the local sewer.

496
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,478
You and I are very much alike.

497
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,921
Archaeology is our religion,

498
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:25,519
yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.

499
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,929
Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend.

500
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:32,469
I am a shadowy
reflection of you.

501
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:35,334
It would take only a nudge
to make you like me,

502
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,533
to push you out of the light.

503
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:41,203
Now you're getting nasty.

504
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,405
You know it's true.

505
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,311
How nice.

506
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,373
Look at this.

507
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,248
It's worthless.

508
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,651
Ten dollars
from a vendor in the street.

509
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,882
But I take it,

510
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,583
I bury it in the sand
for a thousand years,

511
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:58,458
it becomes priceless...
like the Ark.

512
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,326
Men will kill for it.

513
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,093
Men like you and me.

514
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,227
What about your boss,
der Fuehrer?

515
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,795
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

516
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,535
All in good time.

517
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:15,043
When I am finished with it.

518
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,673
Jones, do you realize
what the Ark is?

519
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,717
It's a transmitter.

520
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:23,582
It's a radio
for speaking to God.

521
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,246
And it's within my reach.

522
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:30,792
You want to talk to God?

523
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,658
Let's go see Him together.

524
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,527
I've got nothing better to do.

525
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,294
Uncle Indy, come back home now!

526
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,304
Uncle Indy!

527
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,130
Next time, Indiana Jones,

528
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,802
it'll take more than children
to save you.

529
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,577
Uncle Indy!

530
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,254
I thought I would
find you there.

531
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,524
Better than the United
States Marines, eh?

532
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,273
Marion's dead.

533
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,604
Yes, I know.

534
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,803
And me! And me!

535
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,471
I'm sorry.

536
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,276
Life goes on, Indy.

537
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,146
There is the proof.

538
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,087
Uh-oh.

539
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,520
I have much to tell you.

540
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,251
First we will take them home,

541
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,792
and then I will take you
to the old man.

542
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,072
I can't figure out
how Belloq did it.

543
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,581
Where'd he get a copy
of the headpiece?

544
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:35,914
There are no pictures,
no duplicates of it anywhere.

545
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,921
I tell you only what I saw
with my own eyes:

546
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,353
A headpiece like that one,

547
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,654
except round the edges,
which were rougher.

548
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,785
In the center, the Frenchman
had embedded a crystal,

549
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:49,731
and... and surrounding
the crystal, on one side,

550
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,461
there were raised markings,
just like that one.

551
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:56,235
They made their calculations
in the map room?

552
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,671
This morning.

553
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:00,039
Belloq and the boss German,
Dietrich.

554
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,738
When they came out
of the map room,

555
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:05,077
they gave us a new spot
in which to dig,

556
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,878
out away from the camp.

557
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,885
The Well of the Souls, huh?

558
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,888
Come, come, look.
Look here... look.

559
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,481
Sit down.

560
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,083
Come, sit down.

561
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,094
What is it?

562
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,357
This is a warning

563
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,865
not to disturb
the Ark of the Covenant.

564
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,526
What about the height
of the staff, though?

565
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,694
Did Belloq get it off of here?

566
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,702
Yes.

567
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:29,170
It is here.

568
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,070
This were the old way,

569
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,609
this mean six kadam high.

570
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:34,837
-About 72 inches.
-Wait!

571
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,282
''And take back one kadam

572
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:45,219
to honor the Hebrew God
whose Ark this is.''

573
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,402
You said their headpiece
only had markings on one side.

574
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,266
Are you absolutely sure?

575
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,968
Belloq's staff is too long.

576
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,806
They're digging
in the wrong place.

577
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,641
I am the monarch of the sea

578
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,581
I am the ruler of the--

579
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,156
Bad dates.

580
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,474
I told you not to be premature

581
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,880
in your communiqué to Berlin.

582
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,249
Archaeology is not
an exact science.

583
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,447
It does not deal
in time schedules.

584
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,513
The fuehrer is not
a patient man.

585
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:58,027
He demands constant reports,
and he expects progress.

586
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,585
You led me to believe...

587
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,096
Nothing!
I made no promises.

588
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,132
I only said
it looked very favorable.

589
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,465
Besides, with the information
in our possession,

590
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,470
my calculations were correct.

591
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,369
Boy, they're not kidding,
are they?

592
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:14,210
What time does the sun
hit the map room?

593
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,268
At about 9:00 in the morning.

594
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,472
Not much time, then.

595
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:20,380
Where are they digging
for the Well of the Souls?

596
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,715
On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.

597
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,084
Let's go, come on.

598
00:54:31,633 --> 00:54:33,191
Sallah.

599
00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:36,067
Sallah!

600
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:44,868
They're here.

601
00:54:55,924 --> 00:54:57,391
Please, my friend,
what is the matter?

602
00:54:57,459 --> 00:54:59,120
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.

603
00:55:01,897 --> 00:55:03,888
If you want water,
I will get you water.

604
00:55:04,032 --> 00:55:05,294
No problem, no problem.

605
00:55:19,314 --> 00:55:20,679
I thought you were dead.

606
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:22,512
You must have switched baskets.

607
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:28,116
Are you hurt?

608
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,886
No. You have to get me
out of here, quick.

609
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:33,257
They're gonna be back
at any minute.

610
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:34,260
Cut me loose.

611
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:35,318
Quick.

612
00:55:35,397 --> 00:55:37,888
They keep asking about you.
What you know.

613
00:55:42,637 --> 00:55:44,036
What's wrong?

614
00:55:44,106 --> 00:55:45,038
Cut me loose.

615
00:55:45,107 --> 00:55:46,506
I know where the Ark is, Marion.

616
00:55:46,575 --> 00:55:48,805
The Ark's here?

617
00:55:48,877 --> 00:55:50,504
I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here!

618
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:51,910
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!

619
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,038
If I take you out of here now,

620
00:55:53,115 --> 00:55:54,582
they'll start combing
the place for us.

621
00:55:54,649 --> 00:55:56,082
Jones, you've got to get me
out of here!

622
00:55:56,151 --> 00:55:58,847
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?!

623
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,353
Marion, I hate to do this,

624
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:02,982
but if you don't sit
still and keep quiet,

625
00:56:03,058 --> 00:56:05,390
this whole thing
is going to be shot.

626
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:08,454
I'll be back to get you.

627
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,259
Jones, what's the matter?

628
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:57,503
That's it.

629
00:56:57,579 --> 00:56:58,671
Who knows?

630
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:00,738
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting

631
00:57:00,816 --> 00:57:03,284
in some antechamber
for us to discover.

632
00:57:03,351 --> 00:57:07,219
Perhaps there's some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us.

633
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:08,221
Perhaps...

634
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:09,985
Perhaps the girl can help us.

635
00:57:10,058 --> 00:57:11,389
My feeling exactly.

636
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,588
She was in possession
of the original piece for years.

637
00:57:14,663 --> 00:57:17,029
She may know much,
if properly motivated.

638
00:57:17,098 --> 00:57:19,566
I tell you,
the girl knows nothing.

639
00:57:20,735 --> 00:57:22,635
I'm surprised
to find you squeamish.

640
00:57:22,704 --> 00:57:24,194
That is not your reputation.

641
00:57:24,272 --> 00:57:25,671
But it needn't concern you.

642
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,231
I have the perfect man
for this kind of work.

643
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:35,215
Heil Hitler.

644
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:58,827
Indy! Here!

645
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,834
We've hit stone!

646
00:59:03,972 --> 00:59:05,496
Clear it off.

647
00:59:05,574 --> 00:59:06,939
Come on, find the edges.

648
00:59:23,825 --> 00:59:25,486
Good, good, good.

649
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,118
You see, Indy? You see?

650
00:59:27,195 --> 00:59:29,095
Okay, bring the pry bars in.

651
00:59:29,164 --> 00:59:30,927
As a team, boys! As a team!

652
00:59:33,034 --> 00:59:33,864
Push!

653
00:59:39,207 --> 00:59:40,367
Get 'em in there.

654
00:59:40,442 --> 00:59:41,374
Get 'em under.

655
00:59:41,443 --> 00:59:42,375
Good, good, that's it.

656
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:43,411
Watch your toes.

657
00:59:50,986 --> 00:59:52,749
Carefully, carefully!

658
01:00:03,865 --> 01:00:06,425
Sorry, Indy.

659
01:00:07,502 --> 01:00:09,804
Indy...

660
01:00:09,871 --> 01:00:12,533
why does the floor move?

661
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:15,968
Give me your torch.

662
01:00:46,307 --> 01:00:48,241
Snakes.

663
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:49,640
Why did it have to be snakes?

664
01:00:53,381 --> 01:00:56,316
Asps.

665
01:00:56,384 --> 01:00:58,978
Very dangerous.

666
01:00:59,087 --> 01:01:00,111
You go first.

667
01:01:19,607 --> 01:01:21,700
If you're trying
to escape on foot,

668
01:01:21,776 --> 01:01:25,041
the desert is three weeks
in every direction,

669
01:01:25,113 --> 01:01:26,978
so please, eat something.

670
01:01:34,022 --> 01:01:36,149
I must apologize
for their treatment of you.

671
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:37,350
Yeah. Whose idea was it?

672
01:01:37,425 --> 01:01:38,517
No food, no water.

673
01:01:38,593 --> 01:01:40,788
What kind of people
are these friends of yours?

674
01:01:40,862 --> 01:01:43,797
At this particular time
and place, to do my work,

675
01:01:43,865 --> 01:01:45,765
they are necessary evils.

676
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:47,301
They're not my friends.

677
01:01:47,368 --> 01:01:49,598
However, with the
right connections,

678
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:51,605
even in this part of the world,

679
01:01:51,673 --> 01:01:54,699
we are not entirely uncivilized.

680
01:01:56,344 --> 01:01:58,278
It's beautiful.

681
01:01:58,346 --> 01:02:00,871
I would very much like
to see you in it.

682
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:05,044
I'll bet you would.

683
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,958
All right.

684
01:02:18,867 --> 01:02:20,960
What do you got to drink
around here?

685
01:02:23,705 --> 01:02:25,832
We don't have much time.

686
01:02:25,907 --> 01:02:26,941
Soon they will come to harm you,

687
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:27,873
Soon they will come to harm you,

688
01:02:27,942 --> 01:02:29,933
and I will not be able
to stop them,

689
01:02:30,011 --> 01:02:32,502
unless you are able
to give me something

690
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,514
to placate them.

691
01:02:34,582 --> 01:02:37,517
Some, uh, piece
of information...

692
01:02:37,585 --> 01:02:40,349
which I can use
to protect you from them.

693
01:02:40,421 --> 01:02:42,651
I've already told you
everything I know.

694
01:02:42,724 --> 01:02:45,454
I have no loyalty to Jones.

695
01:02:45,527 --> 01:02:48,052
He's brought me
nothing but trouble.

696
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:56,460
Marion, you are beautiful.

697
01:03:01,442 --> 01:03:04,673
I don't think
we need a chaperone.

698
01:03:07,715 --> 01:03:09,205
Steadily.

699
01:03:09,284 --> 01:03:11,252
Steadily. Whoa!

700
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:14,613
Down...

701
01:03:14,689 --> 01:03:15,781
Down-- Whoa.

702
01:03:15,857 --> 01:03:16,915
Carefully, carefully!

703
01:03:17,025 --> 01:03:19,255
You all right, Indy?

704
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:26,833
Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently!

705
01:03:35,076 --> 01:03:35,838
Whoa...

706
01:03:45,854 --> 01:03:47,151
I told you it will be all right.

707
01:04:03,738 --> 01:04:05,262
Huh...

708
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:15,314
Sallah, get down here!

709
01:04:34,602 --> 01:04:36,502
You pour.

710
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:31,885
Oh, that's good.

711
01:06:35,156 --> 01:06:36,555
Whoops.

712
01:06:42,797 --> 01:06:44,458
What is this stuff, Rene?

713
01:06:46,234 --> 01:06:47,701
I grew up with this.

714
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:50,862
It's my family label.

715
01:07:20,168 --> 01:07:23,660
Well... I have to be
going now, Rene.

716
01:07:25,473 --> 01:07:28,601
I like you, Rene, very much.

717
01:07:28,676 --> 01:07:31,338
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

718
01:07:35,683 --> 01:07:37,844
We meet again, Fraulein.

719
01:07:39,454 --> 01:07:41,752
You Americans,
you're all the same.

720
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:46,986
Always overdressing
for the wrong occasions.

721
01:08:17,492 --> 01:08:19,824
Now...

722
01:08:22,296 --> 01:08:25,026
what shall we talk about?

723
01:09:42,743 --> 01:09:45,644
All right... take it up!

724
01:09:45,713 --> 01:09:47,738
Easy!

725
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,079
You're as stubborn as that girl.

726
01:09:51,152 --> 01:09:53,780
You like her too much, I think.

727
01:09:53,854 --> 01:09:58,518
Your methods of archaeology
are too primitive for me.

728
01:09:58,593 --> 01:10:02,654
You would use a bulldozer
to find a... China cup.

729
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:08,898
Shliemann! Wake your men!

730
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:11,131
Indy, the torches
are burning out.

731
01:10:11,205 --> 01:10:13,139
Go on, get out of here.

732
01:10:13,207 --> 01:10:15,004
Hyah!

733
01:10:32,893 --> 01:10:34,053
Sallah!

734
01:10:34,128 --> 01:10:35,117
Hello!

735
01:10:36,163 --> 01:10:37,095
Hello!

736
01:10:37,164 --> 01:10:39,758
Why, Dr. Jones,
whatever are you doing

737
01:10:39,834 --> 01:10:42,325
in such a nasty place?

738
01:10:42,403 --> 01:10:44,394
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!

739
01:10:44,472 --> 01:10:45,496
Thank you, my friend,

740
01:10:45,573 --> 01:10:47,973
but I think we are all
very comfortable up here.

741
01:10:48,109 --> 01:10:49,303
That's right, isn't it?

742
01:10:50,411 --> 01:10:52,743
Yes, we are very comfortable
up here.

743
01:10:54,115 --> 01:10:56,083
So, once again, Jones,

744
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:59,278
what was briefly yours
is now mine.

745
01:10:59,353 --> 01:11:01,844
What a fitting end
to your life's pursuits.

746
01:11:01,922 --> 01:11:04,413
You're about to become
a permanent addition

747
01:11:04,492 --> 01:11:06,084
to this archaeological find.

748
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,422
Who knows?

749
01:11:07,495 --> 01:11:09,759
In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

750
01:11:12,099 --> 01:11:13,794
Son of a bitch.

751
01:11:13,868 --> 01:11:15,733
I'm afraid we must be
going now, Dr. Jones.

752
01:11:15,803 --> 01:11:18,135
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.

753
01:11:18,205 --> 01:11:20,139
But I do not wish to leave you

754
01:11:20,207 --> 01:11:22,539
down in that awful place
all alone.

755
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:24,441
Slimy pig, you let me go!

756
01:11:24,512 --> 01:11:25,604
Stop it!

757
01:11:28,382 --> 01:11:29,906
Marion!

758
01:11:29,984 --> 01:11:30,951
Hang on.

759
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:33,277
Don't...

760
01:11:33,354 --> 01:11:34,946
-Indy!
-Don't fall!

761
01:11:35,056 --> 01:11:37,354
Marion, I got you!
I got you! I got you!

762
01:11:41,128 --> 01:11:43,323
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!

763
01:11:51,305 --> 01:11:52,363
Snakes!

764
01:11:53,908 --> 01:11:55,307
Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!

765
01:11:56,977 --> 01:11:58,137
The girl was mine!

766
01:11:58,212 --> 01:11:59,179
She's of no use to us.

767
01:11:59,246 --> 01:12:01,237
Only our mission
for the fuehrer matters.

768
01:12:03,684 --> 01:12:05,777
I wonder sometimes, Monsieur,

769
01:12:05,853 --> 01:12:08,219
if you have that
clearly in mind.

770
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:10,223
It was not to be, chérie.

771
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:13,021
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!

772
01:12:13,094 --> 01:12:15,927
Indiana Jones...

773
01:12:16,063 --> 01:12:17,030
adieu.

774
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:31,544
No!

775
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:42,049
Take this.

776
01:12:42,123 --> 01:12:43,886
Wave it at anything
that slithers.

777
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,118
Thank you.

778
01:12:45,192 --> 01:12:47,854
Oh, my God, this whole
place is slithering.

779
01:12:50,898 --> 01:12:51,956
Indy!

780
01:12:52,099 --> 01:12:54,693
Ow! Jesus!

781
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:58,930
Where did you get this?
From him?

782
01:12:59,006 --> 01:13:00,337
I was trying to escape.

783
01:13:00,408 --> 01:13:01,375
No thanks to you.

784
01:13:01,442 --> 01:13:02,909
How hard were you trying?

785
01:13:02,977 --> 01:13:04,137
Well, where the hell were you?

786
01:13:04,211 --> 01:13:05,473
Watch it, watch it.

787
01:13:05,546 --> 01:13:06,877
What are you doing?!

788
01:13:06,947 --> 01:13:08,471
For the fire!

789
01:13:10,551 --> 01:13:12,280
How the hell are we going
to get out of here?

790
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:13,820
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!

791
01:13:13,888 --> 01:13:15,583
Well, whatever you're
doing, do it faster.

792
01:13:19,794 --> 01:13:21,193
Ah...

793
01:13:21,262 --> 01:13:23,093
Where are you going?

794
01:13:23,164 --> 01:13:24,597
Through that wall.

795
01:13:24,665 --> 01:13:27,065
Just get ready to run,
whatever happens to me.

796
01:13:27,134 --> 01:13:28,692
What do you mean by that?

797
01:13:40,147 --> 01:13:42,672
Indy!

798
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:45,514
Damn it! Don't you leave me
down here by myself!

799
01:14:10,377 --> 01:14:12,140
Indy!

800
01:14:12,213 --> 01:14:13,373
Here we go!

801
01:14:13,447 --> 01:14:14,379
Get ready!

802
01:14:14,448 --> 01:14:18,316
Indy, the torch is going out!

803
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:00,726
Indy?

804
01:15:21,081 --> 01:15:22,810
Marion!

805
01:15:22,883 --> 01:15:25,374
Look. Look.

806
01:16:03,457 --> 01:16:05,220
They're going to fly it
out of here.

807
01:16:05,292 --> 01:16:06,691
When that Ark gets loaded,

808
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,921
we're already going
to be on the plane.

809
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:17,560
Ah, monsieur, let us toast
our success in the desert.

810
01:16:17,638 --> 01:16:18,832
To the Ark.

811
01:16:18,906 --> 01:16:20,874
When we are very far
from here.

812
01:16:20,941 --> 01:16:22,602
That will do.

813
01:17:14,828 --> 01:17:19,231
Hey, you now-- come here!

814
01:17:19,299 --> 01:17:20,732
Come here!

815
01:18:25,966 --> 01:18:27,228
Indy!

816
01:19:18,252 --> 01:19:20,311
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!

817
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:26,890
Look out!

818
01:19:37,704 --> 01:19:39,035
Oh, my God.

819
01:19:39,106 --> 01:19:39,902
Marion.

820
01:19:39,973 --> 01:19:42,771
In here! Up here!

821
01:19:45,445 --> 01:19:46,503
Indy, come on!

822
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:47,672
Hold on!

823
01:19:47,748 --> 01:19:49,716
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!

824
01:19:51,552 --> 01:19:54,851
It's stuck! Indy!

825
01:19:56,089 --> 01:19:57,613
I can't push it off!

826
01:20:27,521 --> 01:20:28,419
It's stuck!

827
01:20:28,488 --> 01:20:29,921
-Turn it! Turn it!
-It's stuck!

828
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:31,116
Turn it there!

829
01:20:31,191 --> 01:20:32,783
Never mind!
Get back! Get back!

830
01:20:54,381 --> 01:20:56,747
Get the Ark away from
this place immediately.

831
01:20:56,817 --> 01:20:58,717
Have it put on the truck.

832
01:20:58,785 --> 01:21:00,184
We'll fly it out of Cairo.

833
01:21:00,254 --> 01:21:03,052
And Gobler, I want
plenty of protection.

834
01:21:09,563 --> 01:21:11,224
Jones.

835
01:21:17,004 --> 01:21:18,335
Holy smoke, my friends,

836
01:21:18,405 --> 01:21:20,270
I... I'm so pleased
you're not dead!

837
01:21:22,042 --> 01:21:23,532
Indy, Indy, we have no time.

838
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:24,941
If you still want the Ark,

839
01:21:25,078 --> 01:21:27,444
it is being loaded
onto a truck for Cairo.

840
01:21:27,514 --> 01:21:29,379
Truck?

841
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:30,643
What truck?

842
01:21:57,911 --> 01:21:59,173
Let's go!

843
01:22:07,587 --> 01:22:09,782
Get back to Cairo.

844
01:22:09,856 --> 01:22:11,915
Get us some transport
to England--

845
01:22:12,025 --> 01:22:14,926
boat, plane, anything.

846
01:22:15,062 --> 01:22:16,051
Meet me at Omar's.

847
01:22:16,129 --> 01:22:17,061
Be ready for me.

848
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:18,188
I'm going after that truck.

849
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:19,197
How?

850
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:20,198
I don't know.

851
01:22:20,267 --> 01:22:21,757
I'm making this up as I go.

852
01:25:59,186 --> 01:26:00,710
Ew!

853
01:28:22,595 --> 01:28:23,562
He's there!

854
01:29:16,216 --> 01:29:17,911
Idiot! Idiot!

855
01:30:02,762 --> 01:30:04,923
Everything at last
has been arranged.

856
01:30:04,998 --> 01:30:06,260
The Ark?

857
01:30:06,332 --> 01:30:07,321
Is on board.

858
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,334
Nothing is lacking,
now that you're here.

859
01:30:09,402 --> 01:30:10,664
Or what is left of you.

860
01:30:10,737 --> 01:30:11,669
You trust these guys?

861
01:30:11,738 --> 01:30:13,103
Yes.

862
01:30:13,173 --> 01:30:15,368
Mr. Katanga.

863
01:30:19,579 --> 01:30:22,104
Mr. Katanga,
these are my friends.

864
01:30:22,182 --> 01:30:23,945
They are my family.

865
01:30:24,017 --> 01:30:26,884
I will hear of it
if they are not treated well.

866
01:30:26,953 --> 01:30:29,945
My cabin is theirs.

867
01:30:30,089 --> 01:30:31,681
Mr. Jones...

868
01:30:31,758 --> 01:30:34,283
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

869
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:37,386
Your appearance is exactly
the way I imagined.

870
01:30:42,302 --> 01:30:44,600
Good-bye.

871
01:30:46,039 --> 01:30:47,973
Look out for each other.

872
01:30:48,107 --> 01:30:50,234
I am already missing you.

873
01:30:52,512 --> 01:30:54,776
You're my good friend.

874
01:30:56,483 --> 01:30:58,542
Sallah.

875
01:31:01,855 --> 01:31:04,653
That is for Fayah...

876
01:31:04,724 --> 01:31:07,192
that is for your children...

877
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,660
and this is for you.

878
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,924
Thank you.

879
01:31:24,611 --> 01:31:29,571
A British tar is a soaring soul

880
01:31:29,649 --> 01:31:34,211
As free as a mountain bird

881
01:31:34,287 --> 01:31:37,950
His energetic fist
should be ready to...

882
01:31:40,393 --> 01:31:42,327
...a dictator...

883
01:31:48,835 --> 01:31:50,769
Where did you go?

884
01:31:50,837 --> 01:31:51,895
I'm cleaning up.

885
01:31:53,473 --> 01:31:55,407
Where'd you get that?

886
01:31:55,475 --> 01:31:56,874
From him.

887
01:31:56,943 --> 01:31:58,274
Who him?

888
01:31:58,344 --> 01:31:59,276
Katanga.

889
01:31:59,345 --> 01:32:01,245
I got a feeling
I'm not the first woman

890
01:32:01,314 --> 01:32:02,906
ever to travel
with these pirates.

891
01:32:03,049 --> 01:32:05,210
It's lovely.

892
01:32:05,285 --> 01:32:06,217
Yeah?

893
01:32:06,286 --> 01:32:07,218
Yeah.

894
01:32:07,287 --> 01:32:08,219
Really?

895
01:32:08,288 --> 01:32:10,153
Yeah.

896
01:32:21,334 --> 01:32:23,097
What'd you say?

897
01:32:30,076 --> 01:32:32,306
Wait... I don't need any help.

898
01:32:32,378 --> 01:32:34,039
You know you do.

899
01:32:35,715 --> 01:32:39,207
You're not the man
I knew ten years ago.

900
01:32:39,285 --> 01:32:43,881
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

901
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,160
You are...

902
01:32:50,430 --> 01:32:52,057
Please, I don't need a nurse.

903
01:32:52,131 --> 01:32:53,598
-I just want to sleep.
-Don't be such a baby.

904
01:32:53,666 --> 01:32:54,690
Marion, leave me alone.

905
01:32:54,767 --> 01:32:56,132
-What is this here?
-Go away.

906
01:32:56,202 --> 01:32:58,568
Yes, it hurts.

907
01:32:58,638 --> 01:32:59,935
Ow!

908
01:33:00,006 --> 01:33:02,133
Well, goddamn it, Indy,
where doesn't it hurt?

909
01:33:03,776 --> 01:33:05,505
Here.

910
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:12,415
Here.

911
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:23,028
This isn't too bad.

912
01:33:32,572 --> 01:33:33,539
Here.

913
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,327
Jones...

914
01:33:58,131 --> 01:34:00,190
Jones?!

915
01:34:02,669 --> 01:34:06,435
We never seem to get
a break, do we?

916
01:34:32,765 --> 01:34:34,164
What is it?

917
01:34:34,233 --> 01:34:35,598
Engines have stopped.

918
01:34:35,668 --> 01:34:37,101
I'm going to go check.

919
01:34:47,947 --> 01:34:48,879
What's happening?

920
01:34:48,948 --> 01:34:50,210
We have most important friends.

921
01:34:50,283 --> 01:34:51,910
Holy shit.

922
01:34:53,653 --> 01:34:54,415
I sent my man for you.

923
01:34:54,487 --> 01:34:55,579
You and the girl must disappear.

924
01:34:55,655 --> 01:34:56,644
We have a place in the hold.

925
01:34:56,723 --> 01:34:57,348
Come on, go, go, go.

926
01:34:57,423 --> 01:34:58,390
Come on, go, my friend, go.

927
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:13,502
Where is Dr. Jones?

928
01:35:13,573 --> 01:35:14,505
What's the big idea?

929
01:35:14,574 --> 01:35:15,871
Let go!

930
01:35:20,046 --> 01:35:22,776
Don't you touch me.

931
01:36:06,859 --> 01:36:08,690
What about Jones?

932
01:36:08,761 --> 01:36:11,059
There's no trace yet, sir.

933
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:13,223
Jones is dead.

934
01:36:14,567 --> 01:36:16,762
I killed him.

935
01:36:16,836 --> 01:36:18,804
He was of no use to us.

936
01:36:18,871 --> 01:36:23,899
This girl, however, has certain
value where we're headed.

937
01:36:24,043 --> 01:36:26,534
She'll bring a very good price.

938
01:36:26,612 --> 01:36:27,544
Mmm?

939
01:36:27,613 --> 01:36:31,208
Herr Colonel,
that cargo you've taken--

940
01:36:31,284 --> 01:36:33,184
if it's your goal,
go in peace with it,

941
01:36:33,252 --> 01:36:34,344
but leave us the girl.

942
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:36,320
It would reduce our loss
on this trip.

943
01:36:36,389 --> 01:36:38,084
Savage!

944
01:36:38,157 --> 01:36:41,718
You are not in the position
to ask for anything.

945
01:36:41,794 --> 01:36:43,694
We will take what we wish.

946
01:36:43,763 --> 01:36:45,458
And then decide whether or not

947
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:47,499
to blow your ship
from the water.

948
01:36:50,736 --> 01:36:52,135
The girl goes with me.

949
01:36:52,205 --> 01:36:54,503
She'll be part
of my compensation.

950
01:36:54,574 --> 01:36:56,940
I'm sure your fuehrer
would approve.

951
01:36:57,009 --> 01:36:58,704
If she fails to please me,

952
01:36:58,778 --> 01:37:00,837
you may do with her as you wish.

953
01:37:00,913 --> 01:37:03,711
I will waste
no more time with her now.

954
01:37:03,783 --> 01:37:04,875
Excuse me.

955
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,029
I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.

956
01:37:23,102 --> 01:37:24,364
I've looked everywhere.

957
01:37:24,437 --> 01:37:26,905
He's got to be here somewhere.

958
01:37:27,006 --> 01:37:28,098
Look again.

959
01:37:30,009 --> 01:37:31,806
-I found him.
-Where?

960
01:37:31,878 --> 01:37:32,708
There.

961
01:39:59,025 --> 01:40:01,255
The altar has been
prepared in accordance

962
01:40:01,327 --> 01:40:03,192
with your radio instructions,
sir.

963
01:40:03,262 --> 01:40:04,286
Good.

964
01:40:04,363 --> 01:40:05,830
Take the Ark there immediately.

965
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,195
Monsieur...

966
01:40:11,704 --> 01:40:13,865
I am uncomfortable
with the thought

967
01:40:13,939 --> 01:40:16,499
of this... Jewish ritual.

968
01:40:18,044 --> 01:40:20,410
Are you sure it's necessary?

969
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:22,379
Let me ask you this:

970
01:40:22,448 --> 01:40:26,578
Would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin,

971
01:40:26,652 --> 01:40:28,449
for your fuehrer?

972
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:29,783
Finding out, only then,

973
01:40:29,855 --> 01:40:32,881
if the sacred pieces
of the Covenant are inside?

974
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:33,947
Knowing, only then,

975
01:40:34,093 --> 01:40:36,084
whether you have accomplished
your mission,

976
01:40:36,162 --> 01:40:39,222
and obtained the one true Ark?

977
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:08,917
Hello!

978
01:42:11,524 --> 01:42:12,684
Jones.

979
01:42:13,993 --> 01:42:15,392
Jones!

980
01:42:15,461 --> 01:42:17,554
I'm going to blow up the Ark,
Rene.

981
01:42:23,435 --> 01:42:27,599
Your persistence
surprises even me.

982
01:42:27,673 --> 01:42:30,141
You're going to give
mercenaries a bad name.

983
01:42:30,209 --> 01:42:32,837
Dr. Jones...

984
01:42:35,347 --> 01:42:37,872
surely you don't think you can
escape from this island.

985
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:40,942
That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

986
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:43,181
All I want is the girl.

987
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:49,088
If we refuse?

988
01:42:49,161 --> 01:42:52,961
Then your fuehrer has no prize.

989
01:42:53,032 --> 01:42:54,294
Okay, stand back.

990
01:42:54,366 --> 01:42:55,628
All of you, stand back.

991
01:42:55,701 --> 01:42:57,293
Stand back.

992
01:42:57,369 --> 01:42:58,495
Okay, Jones.

993
01:42:58,571 --> 01:43:01,734
You win!

994
01:43:01,807 --> 01:43:03,240
Blow it up.

995
01:43:08,981 --> 01:43:10,107
Yes, blow it up!

996
01:43:12,451 --> 01:43:14,442
Blow it back to God.

997
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,545
All your life has been spent

998
01:43:16,622 --> 01:43:19,182
in pursuit
of archaeological relics.

999
01:43:19,258 --> 01:43:23,718
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

1000
01:43:23,796 --> 01:43:28,130
You want to see it open
as well as I.

1001
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,464
Indiana...

1002
01:43:30,536 --> 01:43:34,768
we are simply passing
through history.

1003
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:35,966
This...

1004
01:43:38,677 --> 01:43:40,304
This is history.

1005
01:43:49,488 --> 01:43:51,854
Do as you will.

1006
01:46:26,845 --> 01:46:29,211
Marion, don't look at it.

1007
01:46:29,281 --> 01:46:30,305
Shut your eyes, Marion.

1008
01:46:30,382 --> 01:46:32,282
Don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

1009
01:46:43,896 --> 01:46:46,421
Ah...

1010
01:47:00,446 --> 01:47:03,210
It's beautiful!

1011
01:47:13,325 --> 01:47:14,451
Indy?

1012
01:47:14,526 --> 01:47:15,788
Don't look, Marion!

1013
01:47:15,861 --> 01:47:17,260
Keep your eyes shut!

1014
01:48:35,307 --> 01:48:36,433
Marion.

1015
01:49:09,007 --> 01:49:12,067
You've done your country a
great service, and we thank you

1016
01:49:12,144 --> 01:49:16,547
and we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

1017
01:49:16,615 --> 01:49:17,707
Oh, the money's fine.

1018
01:49:17,783 --> 01:49:19,614
The situation's
totally unacceptable.

1019
01:49:19,685 --> 01:49:20,617
Well, gentlemen,

1020
01:49:20,686 --> 01:49:22,415
I guess that just about
wraps it up.

1021
01:49:22,487 --> 01:49:24,318
Where is the Ark?

1022
01:49:24,389 --> 01:49:27,552
I thought we'd settled that.

1023
01:49:27,626 --> 01:49:29,890
The Ark is somewhere very safe.

1024
01:49:29,962 --> 01:49:31,088
From whom?

1025
01:49:31,163 --> 01:49:34,223
The Ark is a source
of unspeakable power

1026
01:49:34,299 --> 01:49:36,392
and it has to be researched.

1027
01:49:36,468 --> 01:49:39,562
And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody,

1028
01:49:39,638 --> 01:49:40,764
Dr. Jones.

1029
01:49:40,839 --> 01:49:44,400
We have top men
working on it right now.

1030
01:49:45,777 --> 01:49:46,937
Who?

1031
01:49:48,647 --> 01:49:50,911
Top men.

1032
01:49:54,186 --> 01:49:56,450
Hey, what happened?

1033
01:49:56,521 --> 01:49:57,579
You don't look very happy.

1034
01:49:57,656 --> 01:49:59,590
Fools. Bureaucratic fools.

1035
01:49:59,658 --> 01:50:00,682
What'd they say?

1036
01:50:00,759 --> 01:50:03,819
They don't know
what they've got there.

1037
01:50:03,895 --> 01:50:07,262
Well, I know what I've got here.

1038
01:50:07,332 --> 01:50:08,594
Come on.

1039
01:50:08,667 --> 01:50:10,066
I'll buy you a drink.

1040
01:50:12,004 --> 01:50:13,938
You know...

1041
01:50:14,006 --> 01:50:15,997
a drink?
