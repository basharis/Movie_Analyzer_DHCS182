1
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,386
Come away, oh, human child,

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,143
to the waters and the wild

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,650
with a fairy, hand in hand,

4
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,207
for the world's more full of weeping

5
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,367
than you can understand.

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,569
Will you try it with me, Ben?

7
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,904
Okay.

8
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:33,150
I forget.

9
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,755
Bedtime. Finish up, you two.

10
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,956
Dad, look at the selkie.

11
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,551
- Look.
- Oh.

12
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,220
She's singing her song

13
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,922
so that she can send all the fairies
home across the sea.

14
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,593
And look, look,
she's turning into a seal.

15
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,187
Do you like the selkie?

16
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,271
She's beautiful.

17
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,941
But we have to finish it
before the baby comes.

18
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,559
We have lots of time to finish it, Ben.

19
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,861
But it's time to sleep now.

20
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,061
Okay.

21
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:13,866
Cu, good boy.

22
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:18,414
Are you all right?

23
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,823
I'm fine. It's fine.

24
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,326
Comfy?

25
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,997
Now, settle down.
There's something I want to give you.

26
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:38,308
What is it?

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,386
This is an ancient shell that my mother
gave me a long time ago.

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,681
Hold it to your ear
and listen carefully.

29
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,851
You'll hear the song of the sea.

30
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,855
I can hear the sea.

31
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,942
Keep listening.

32
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,879
Mum?

33
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,454
Yes?

34
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,499
I can't wait for the baby to come.

35
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,001
We're going to be
best friends, aren't we?

36
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,128
Of course you are.

37
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,966
You're going to be the best
big brother in the world.

38
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,070
Bronach?

39
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,197
Mum?

40
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,397
I'm so sorry.

41
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,773
Bronach!

42
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,566
Mum?

43
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,403
Mum?

44
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,293
Here, Cu, look at this.

45
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,212
Mum used to tell me the story.

46
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,830
It's the giant Mac Lir and his dogs.

47
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,331
They're best friends, like us.

48
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,215
Cu, don't go too close to the water,
it's dangerous.

49
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,444
For someone who hasn't
learned how to talk,

50
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,103
you are really loud.

51
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,493
Oh, come on, Saoirse!

52
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,619
Why don't you go down there

53
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,254
and play with some rocks, or something?

54
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,251
Hey, Cu, I'm drawing
the Great Seanachai.

55
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,272
He has loads of hair, like you.

56
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,045
Dad said I'm in charge

57
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,204
and I say there's no going in the water.

58
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,291
It's dangerous.

59
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,377
I can't.

60
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,214
Cu, I can't!

61
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,177
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

62
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,680
Cu, no!

63
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,433
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

64
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,310
No!

65
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,340
That's it!
I'm not looking after you anymore.

66
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,050
You nearly got me killed.

67
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,585
Come out, with your hands up!

68
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,731
Don't turn around, keep going.

69
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,589
Dad, she went into the water

70
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,081
and nearly got me killed!

71
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,511
Just because it's her birthday,
she thinks she can do whatever she likes.

72
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,547
You'd better give it to her this time
'cause I'm not minding her anymore.

73
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,424
Dad!

74
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,968
What? Are you playing cops 'n' robbers?

75
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,929
Are you going to give out to her?

76
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,348
Here's the birthday girl.

77
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,516
Come up here to me.

78
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,236
Dad!

79
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,405
You were under arrest, were you?

80
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,813
Dad?

81
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,551
Are you here for the birthday party
at the lighthouse today?

82
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,471
Young Saoirse is six, is she?

83
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,858
Well, you old witch.

84
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,529
Granny.

85
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,292
She's going to try and make us

86
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,034
move to the city again, isn't she?

87
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,709
I don't know how you can live
in this awful place.

88
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,387
You children are a state.

89
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,219
Is that your birthday outfit?

90
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,556
Haven't you learnt to speak yet?

91
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,434
The doctors said she
will in her own time.

92
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,614
The child can't be dressed
like that on her birthday.

93
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,148
It's a disgrace!

94
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,954
Put this on.

95
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,997
Little girls only turn six once.

96
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,741
And they need to be properly dressed.

97
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,036
Now, isn't that lovely?

98
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,080
Don't move now, until I call you.

99
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,340
No, that's mine!

100
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,625
Mum gave it to me, not you!

101
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:11,794
Ben!

102
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,880
She's stealing from me again.

103
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,934
She's nothing but a dirty stealer.

104
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,686
I don't want to hear it.

105
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,896
Saoirse!

106
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,429
Your granny wants you downstairs.

107
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:34,242
Now, Saoirse, try some of my nettle tea
and gooseberry buns there.

108
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,568
Very good for the voice.

109
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,071
It might cure you.

110
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:56,139
Now, everybody ready for Saoirse
to blow out the candles?

111
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,007
I want to capture
the emotion of the day.

112
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,385
One big, happy family.

113
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,980
Smile on the count of three.

114
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,389
Ready?

115
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,282
One,

116
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,685
two,

117
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,613
three!

118
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,699
You little terror!

119
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,000
Ben!

120
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,572
Believe me, life is better as a dog, Cu.

121
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,907
Stupid Saoirse, stupid birthdays.

122
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,870
You'll always be my best friend.

123
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,513
The kids are in bed. I'm just heading over
to the mainland for one with Dan.

124
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,715
You're better off not thinking
about that night, you know.

125
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,218
Her anniversary is
just once a year, Mum.

126
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,449
What do you want?

127
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,201
You want a story?

128
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,622
Okay, I'll tell you a story.

129
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,292
Did you ever hear of
Macha the Owl Witch?

130
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,471
Well, she's evil.

131
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,255
You know the island out at sea?

132
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,716
It's called Mac Lir.

133
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,970
It's called that because it's not
an island at all, it's a huge giant.

134
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,184
Macha's owls took all the giant's feelings
and turned him to stone.

135
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,269
And do you know the worst of it?

136
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,722
She was his mother!

137
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:41,360
He was her first victim
and she hasn't stopped since.

138
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,040
To this day, all the fairies are afraid
to come out on Halloween night

139
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,251
because if they do,
Macha's owls will find them

140
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,911
and take their feelings
and turn them to stone.

141
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,256
Tomorrow is Halloween.

142
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,175
Macha's owls might even come here

143
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,252
and take Dad's feelings
and turn him to stone!

144
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,837
And then nobody would love you.

145
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,600
And this is what Macha looks like.

146
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,853
Saoirse, it's just one of Mum's stories.

147
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,355
It's not real.

148
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,026
Saoirse!

149
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,324
Saoirse!

150
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,710
The child.

151
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,639
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my good...

152
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,193
This is the last straw now.

153
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,104
I'll not have any more of this
wild carry-on. No more of it!

154
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,526
Now look, you've caught a cold.

155
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,832
Did you know she was up?

156
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,199
- Wha...
- What's wrong?

157
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,835
I found her washed up

158
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,453
on the shore in the middle of the night.

159
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,048
She's not safe in this awful place.

160
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,124
- I know what's best.
- Hold on a second, Mum.

161
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,845
No, you hold on. Where were you?

162
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,463
Off in the pub with that
old fool of a ferryman.

163
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,017
This is no place for children, Conor,

164
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,810
this is no place for a family.

165
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,844
That's the end of it now.

166
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,597
I need to take my medicine.

167
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,394
Oh, Saoirse.

168
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,898
Dad, where did she get this?

169
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,860
Give me that.

170
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,586
I can't lose her, too, Bronach.

171
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,940
Stubborn boy.

172
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,288
I'm not going. You can't make me.

173
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,790
I know what's best for you.

174
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,375
So, you'd better stop this nonsense

175
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,659
at once and do what you're told.

176
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,300
It's not fair.
Please, at least let me take Cu.

177
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,678
- I don't want to go!
- Be quiet, Ben.

178
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,087
Get in the car and stop
all this carry-on.

179
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,642
Dad! Dad, tell her I won't go.

180
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,719
Please, Dad? I'm staying with you.

181
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,846
Dad.

182
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,028
No, Dad, no!
It's Saoirse's fault, not mine.

183
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,355
Why do I have to go? Don't make me go!

184
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,525
- Let me out!
- Stop it, Ben! Will you?

185
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,751
Dad?

186
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,054
Dad!

187
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,412
Cu!

188
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,501
Stay away from the water, you'll drown.

189
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,837
I'll come back for you, I promise.

190
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,556
What's the matter with you, Ben?

191
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,059
Granny wouldn't let Cu come with us.

192
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,073
The old witch.

193
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,443
Would you look at that?

194
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,487
Look, Ben, seals.

195
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:56,868
There haven't been seals
around here for years.

196
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:06,104
Ben, there will be no tears
in this car, or in my house.

197
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,189
Do you hear me, Ben?

198
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,328
The city is no place
for a dog of Cu's size.

199
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,196
He'd only be whimpering
and whining there.

200
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,199
You wouldn't want that
for him now, would you?

201
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,039
You will love it in the city, Ben,
I know you will.

202
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,369
Oh, isn't this nice? I love this song.

203
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,101
Our bathroom's upstairs, dear.

204
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,220
Don't use the good towels,
they're only for guests.

205
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,710
My best coat.

206
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,971
It's not even 4:00.

207
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,391
No-one goes to bed at this time.

208
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,811
Look at that now,
it is completely ruined.

209
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,900
Goodness gracious,
have they no homes to go to?

210
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,695
It's not safe.

211
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:45,708
What the...

212
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:46,908
Are you the selkie?

213
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,877
Get out of that, will you?

214
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,921
Little devils, go on, out with you.

215
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,663
Go, before I ring the police!

216
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:58,920
Quick, get the coat.

217
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,089
The selkie coat.

218
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,973
I'm coming to get you, Cu.

219
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,924
Would you say that could be her?

220
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,667
Could be. Come on.

221
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,686
What do you think you're doing?

222
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,158
No. I'm going home to live with Cu.

223
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,619
You're going to stay at Granny's.

224
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,319
I said no!

225
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,574
Right, that's it.

226
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:22,503
You can only come with me
if you obey my orders at all times.

227
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,307
I'm the oldest and that's the rule.

228
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,143
If you put one step
out of line, I do this...

229
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,184
Hey! You stealer, that's mine.
Give it back.

230
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,231
Ew! You're so disgusting.

231
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,828
Okay, you can keep it for now,

232
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,362
but you'd better clean it
when we get home.

233
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,413
Hey. Excuse me?

234
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,207
Maybe a bus driver could tell us.

235
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,056
Wow.

236
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,560
Look at this, Saoirse.

237
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,826
Holy moly!

238
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,818
Quick, Saoirse, help me catch it!

239
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,619
We've found her,
Lug, we've found her. At last!

240
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:39,173
Don't worry, selkie, we have your coat.

241
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,625
- Come with us.
- Quick, lads, get the selkie to the fort.

242
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,052
Before the owls spot us.

243
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,255
Wait! No!

244
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,550
Wait!

245
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,400
Where are we going?

246
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,549
Lads, what a night.

247
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,718
Not only did we find the selkie coat,

248
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,980
but we found the selkie herself.

249
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,273
Hooray!

250
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,640
Hooray!

251
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:40,975
- Yoo-hoo!
- Huh?

252
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,613
Now, before the selkie sings her
song to send us home,

253
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,440
we should entertain her
with a few of our own tunes.

254
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:50,744
- So, lads, your choice. Who'll get us started.
- Here, Lug?

255
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,736
I'll sing.

256
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,706
No, Spud, we want to keep the mood up

257
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,948
before the main event.

258
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,084
Isn't that right, selkie?

259
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,951
I'll do my best, I promise.

260
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,329
Give Mossy a go first, will you? Yoo!

261
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,134
The selkie song is bright

262
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,960
To waken all who follow

263
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:12,099
Manannan will lead
and Tir Na Nog will follow

264
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:16,103
Do-la-mon, a-pena pwee
Do-la-mon, manuela

265
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,896
Do-la-mon, a-paricka

266
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,982
Par-a-fee a-nerin

267
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,975
Lovely job, Mossy!

268
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,852
Do you hear the lad's tune?

269
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,105
Yoo-hoo!

270
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,399
Right, who's next?

271
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,944
Here, Lug, here. I'll sing.

272
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,779
Oh. Go on, so.

273
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,749
Tell us your name, selkie.

274
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,242
So we can sing of your adventure.

275
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,203
Her name's Saoirse.

276
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,209
Saoirse! Yoo!

277
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:52,546
Saoirse the selkie
will sing and save the day

278
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,393
The day that she who rescued her
will cheer and celebrate

279
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:00,346
Oh, do-la-mon, a-pena pwee
Do-la-mon, manuela

280
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,639
Do-la-mon...

281
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:08,530
Wait! I've forgotten the last verse.

282
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,439
How did I manage that?

283
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,901
Long, long we prayed
to hear the selkie song

284
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:17,122
And now we pray again
that her song will never end

285
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,582
Ha-ha! Yoo!

286
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,033
That's it! Which one of you had it?

287
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,130
Never mind. Keep the crack going, lads.

288
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,925
Do-la-mon, a-pena pwee
Do-la-mon, manuela

289
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,503
Do-la mon la faricka faralee a-nerin

290
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,883
Now, lads, what you've
all been waiting for.

291
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,979
Time for the selkie to
sing her lovely song.

292
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,389
You'll be free soon, lads!

293
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,401
The selkie song will send us all home.

294
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,320
Wait, wait, will you?

295
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,072
Come on, now, selkie, sing it.

296
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,605
Does she know the words?

297
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,658
Give her a chance,
give her a chance, will you?

298
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,035
Her coat.

299
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,944
I almost forgot.

300
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,622
Aren't I some eejit?

301
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:01,750
How was I expecting the selkie
to sing without her coat?

302
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,382
- What's wrong?
- I don't think it's the right coat.

303
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,124
Oh, no.

304
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,752
She can't sing. She can't even talk.

305
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,139
A human child!

306
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,225
You're the one that
gave me the last verse.

307
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:21,520
Yeah, my mother used to sing it.

308
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,387
She said it was a fairy song.

309
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:24,481
That'd be right.

310
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:25,607
So that would make you...

311
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,317
We prefer to call ourselves...

312
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,443
The Other Crowd.

313
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,946
- The Good Names.
- The Deenashee.

314
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:34,189
I can't believe it. The Deenashee.

315
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,400
That's what Mum called the fairies.

316
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,704
You're actually real, not just stories.

317
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,865
Human child, do you know
where the selkie's coat is?

318
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,668
Her real coat.

319
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,254
Yes, my father took it.
It's in our lighthouse.

320
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:50,715
Do you hear that, lads? We are saved!

321
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,769
Daggers out! Protect the selkie.

322
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,560
Get away!

323
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,155
Saoirse!

324
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:14,355
Get back!

325
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,899
No!

326
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,817
- The selkie!
- No!

327
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,119
No!

328
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,579
Hold on!

329
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,131
They're going for the selkie!

330
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,591
Saoirse!

331
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,227
Run!

332
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,934
Run away!

333
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,036
Human child,
find the selkie's true coat,

334
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,445
then she can sing the song
and save us all.

335
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:26,635
Quickly, human child,
before the owls return.

336
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,471
That pipe will see you
to the outside world. Go!

337
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,402
I'd like to sing some more.

338
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,936
Go on so.

339
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,773
Do-la-mon, a-pena pwee,
Do-la-mon...

340
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,822
There's a bus.

341
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,412
Quick, Saoirse.

342
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,583
I just saw real fairies.

343
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,636
Course you did.
Sure haven't I been ferrying

344
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,628
a lot of witches and goblins around.

345
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,475
Where are you going?

346
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,967
Can you take us there?

347
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,104
Well, let me see now...

348
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,773
I can take you as far as Clonmellon.

349
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,984
You might have to wait
for one or two hours,

350
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:18,395
then get the feeder bus,
but that only runs in the mornings.

351
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,032
Sure. You know,
you'll get there eventually.

352
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,817
Okay, two tickets, please.

353
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:36,163
Those stories that Mum told me,
they're all true.

354
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,332
Are you really a...

355
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,667
...selkie?

356
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,756
Oh, genie mackerel.

357
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,637
What are you doing? We're on the bus!

358
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,889
I'm getting us home.

359
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,242
You should've said if you
wanted to get off the bus!

360
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,402
This is not an official stop, you know.

361
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,362
Bleedin' trick or treaters.

362
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,548
Great, just great. Now what do we do?

363
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,929
Oh, right, let's follow
the magical lights.

364
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,297
That's much safer than being on a bus.

365
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,436
Some of these could be fairies

366
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,471
turned to stone,
like the ones in the roundabout.

367
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,060
There he is.

368
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,999
Stop. Those lights drew the fairies

369
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,075
to us and maybe the owls, too.

370
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:22,412
Don't play the shell anymore,
it's too dangerous.

371
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:23,882
I can get us home using my map.

372
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,083
Just you wait and see.

373
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,006
This is the way, I know it.

374
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,612
We're not lost, no way.

375
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,867
If we find a better spot,
I might be able to see the mountains.

376
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,369
Then I'll know the right way.

377
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,582
We're not lost.

378
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,879
What did I say about playing that?

379
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,310
If those owls come back,
I'm going to let them take you.

380
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:20,887
What's that?

381
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,101
Don't let it be Macha.

382
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,229
Please, don't let it be Macha.

383
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,776
Saoirse, get down.

384
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,655
Whoo-hoo!

385
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:40,699
Cu!

386
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,576
Come here, boy, come here!

387
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,621
Okay, okay, get off me.

388
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,125
Oh, Cu, you found us.

389
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:55,390
Wait, if Cu found us here
and he's come all this way on his own,

390
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,591
he can surely get us back home.

391
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,016
Take us home, Cu.

392
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,880
We've a long way to go, you know.

393
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,651
What's happening to you?

394
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,426
Look, the mountains!

395
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,105
We can't keep going like this.

396
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:42,028
It'll be dry there.
Giddy-up, Cu. Come on.

397
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,088
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

398
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,965
Come on, get on my back.

399
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,773
Oh, no, stinging nettles.

400
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,745
Keep your legs up, Saoirse.
These plants sting pretty bad.

401
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,087
Stupid nettles.

402
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,641
I'm just after getting you
out of the rain, you know.

403
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,119
Dock leaves!

404
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,789
Good thinking, Saoirse.

405
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,673
That feels way better.

406
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,133
Thanks.

407
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,794
I drew this holy well on my map,

408
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,005
I knew it. We're on the right track.

409
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:15,775
There'd better not be any snot on it.

410
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,645
When the rain stops,
we can get going again.

411
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,399
Maybe we can take a short cut.

412
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,577
Saoirse?

413
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:31,531
Saoirse!

414
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:35,869
Come up, come up!

415
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,913
She's not coming up.

416
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,587
I can't. I can't do it,
I just can't do it.

417
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,267
I can't.

418
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,810
No, no, no, no!

419
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,748
Saoirse!

420
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,541
Cu!

421
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,809
Okay, okay, okay.

422
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,603
Okay.

423
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,534
Saoirse!

424
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,835
Saoirse.

425
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,302
Do-le-mon, do le...

426
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,221
Do-le-mon...

427
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,422
Do, do-le-mon...

428
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,310
Dooo-le...

429
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,428
Now then, what is it?

430
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:04,392
Do-la-mon, a-pena pwee
Do-la-mon, manuela

431
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,458
How do you know that song?

432
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,117
My mother taught it to me.

433
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,422
And who are you, human child?

434
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:25,830
I'm nobody.

435
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:27,758
Nobody?

436
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,542
I mean, I'm Ben.

437
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,048
I'm looking for my sister.

438
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,311
I lost her down here.

439
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,388
Look at that.

440
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,395
I could do with a little
more light. Could you?

441
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:23,096
So good to see you again,
my little sulcha.

442
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,682
Holy moly!

443
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,651
Who are you?

444
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,288
I told you, I'm Ben.

445
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:42,166
I'm just down here
looking for my sister.

446
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,118
Oh, yes. That's right.

447
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:48,047
Forgive me, I have no memory,

448
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:50,758
except for what is in
these hairs, you see.

449
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,096
Is all of this growing out of you?

450
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:56,588
It seems to be.

451
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:59,299
Are you the Great Seanachai?

452
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,596
Yes. Yes!

453
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,974
- Whoa!
- I am the Great Seanachai!

454
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,184
I'd almost forgotten.

455
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,822
My mum told me stories about you.

456
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,698
Careful, lad.

457
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,325
You could snap a hair,

458
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,452
you'll lose the story of me forever.

459
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,532
Whoa, each hair holds a story?

460
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:26,534
Does it?

461
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,161
Oh, that's right.

462
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,371
That's right.

463
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,166
Show us one here and let's have a look.

464
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,337
Now, let's see...

465
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,383
This is Mac Lir, the great giant.

466
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,721
His heart was broken into pieces

467
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:50,141
by a great, great tragedy.

468
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:55,355
Such was his anguish
that he cried a whole ocean.

469
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,996
Higher and higher, it rose

470
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,031
until we were all sure
to drown in his tears.

471
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,077
I know this.

472
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:14,499
Macha sent her owls
to take his suffering away.

473
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:22,057
And he was turned to stone.

474
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,300
That's right.

475
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:28,054
A sad story by anyone's estimations.

476
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,983
I've seen Macha's owls use those

477
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,902
jars to turn the fairies to stone.

478
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:34,894
And now they're after my sister.

479
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,530
Can you help me?

480
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,980
No.

481
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,366
But...

482
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,608
Well, you see now...

483
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,329
I wouldn't have a clue
about human children.

484
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,905
- Why?
- I only know about my own kind.

485
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,876
But I think she is your kind.

486
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:52,129
Or partly anyway.
The fairies said she was a selkie.

487
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,329
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

488
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,373
What did you say?

489
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,843
A selkie? Really?

490
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,637
Yeah, they were talking about a coat

491
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,680
and a song and now I've lost her.

492
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,589
Something is wrong.

493
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:07,593
They've just been woken
and are already fading?

494
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,608
Why?

495
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:16,686
The sulcha and the selkie,
all of us are connected.

496
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,522
This is not good.

497
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,076
Something must've happened to her.

498
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,869
That's what I'm trying to say.

499
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,246
I lost her down here.

500
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:26,956
Did the selkie have her coat with her?

501
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:29,866
No, it's at home. My dad took it.

502
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:34,838
Blasted humans! They don't have a clue.

503
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,717
You must get the coat back to her.
Do you hear me?

504
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,594
But I don't know where she is.

505
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,754
Hold on a moment, laddie.

506
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:48,384
Very few hairs still grow
because very few of us are left.

507
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,056
But the selkie's, hers still grows.

508
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:58,487
That's her. That's when I lost her.

509
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,614
Let's see what happens then.

510
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:03,951
What's wrong?

511
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,651
Macha has her now.

512
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,821
She'll be turned to
stone soon, no doubt.

513
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:13,168
You see, without her coat,
the selkie has no voice.

514
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,547
And without her song,
she'll not last the night.

515
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,966
And we'll all share in her fate.

516
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,926
Oh, no. I've got to get out of here.

517
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,177
I have to find her.

518
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,555
Wait now. You still have a chance.

519
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:31,145
Follow this,
it will lead you through the tunnel.

520
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,846
Mind, it won't be easy.

521
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,015
Macha has lost all hope.

522
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:39,393
And she will try and make you
lose hope, too.

523
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:45,358
The selkie will not last long
beyond dawn without her coat.

524
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,238
You must hurry.

525
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,374
Okay.

526
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,784
Oh. And be careful.

527
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,203
Why? What's down there?

528
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:08,881
Lad go on with yourself.

529
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,192
Not bad.

530
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:20,736
Bye.

531
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,929
Who said that?

532
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,409
Mum.

533
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:25,625
I can't wait for the baby to come.

534
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:28,554
We're going to be
best friends, aren't we?

535
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:31,964
You're going to be the best
big brother in the world.

536
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:43,809
Bronach?

537
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:45,654
I'm so sorry.

538
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,063
Bronach?

539
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:48,898
Mum?

540
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,167
Bronach!

541
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,503
Bronach!

542
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:13,599
I've no more time,
I have to save our baby.

543
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:14,850
Bronach!

544
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,175
I'm so sorry.

545
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,512
Bronach!

546
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:22,348
Bronach!

547
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,455
Dad?

548
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,835
Dad, where's Mum?

549
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,920
Where's Mum?

550
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,756
- Dad?
- Say hello to Saoirse.

551
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,677
This is your sister.

552
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,472
You're her big brother.

553
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,850
You must always look after her.

554
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:06,545
Okay, okay.

555
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,079
Be careful!

556
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,132
Be brave!

557
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:14,710
Down here. Be careful in there.
Beware of the jars!

558
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:18,765
Good luck.

559
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:19,975
Be careful in there.

560
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:21,801
- Watch it!
- The Owl Witch.

561
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,021
- Good luck.
- Be careful.

562
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,772
Mind her jars.

563
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,556
The Owl Witch, beware!

564
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,539
- Go safe.
- Mind yourself.

565
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,740
- Mind yourself.
- Beware!

566
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:53,833
Okay.

567
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:25,698
You look wet and tired, human child.

568
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,200
Macha?

569
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,953
I am she.

570
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,340
Really?

571
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,834
The Owl Witch from the stories?

572
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,847
Well, now,

573
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:44,383
those stories always
paint me as the bad one.

574
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,927
But I'm not so terrible, you know.

575
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:49,847
I'm just trying to help everyone.

576
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:53,434
Yeah, well, what's in
all these jars then?

577
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,363
Just nasty things, you know.

578
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,272
Nobody needs them.

579
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,867
I know you have my sister. Let her go!

580
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:05,956
Now, now, now, the selkie child
is safe and sound.

581
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,531
Don't you worry.

582
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:17,041
I have taken good care
of the poor little thing.

583
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,585
You're half turned to stone.

584
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,806
Saoirse can help you.
She can help all of you.

585
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:26,258
She can't help, not really help.

586
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,302
Not the way I do.

587
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:33,515
I see it, Ben, your pain.

588
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,519
You're so full of emotions.

589
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,064
I can see them in your face.

590
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,900
Nasty, terrible things.

591
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:46,278
They make you feel so awful.

592
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,291
You worry so much

593
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:51,742
for such a young boy, don't you?

594
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,828
You lost your mother, didn't you?

595
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:02,002
My son lost someone,
too, a long time ago.

596
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,964
But I found a way to help him.

597
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:10,386
Now, if someone said that
they could take that pain away,

598
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,888
would you let them?

599
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:15,975
I suppose.

600
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,435
That's all I do, Ben.

601
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,729
I take away the pain.

602
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:26,944
It doesn't hurt.
It will never hurt again.

603
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,498
No, it doesn't help at all,
it just makes things worse.

604
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:44,128
Please, try to understand.
We need your help.

605
01:03:46,615 --> 01:03:48,924
Don't take me for a fool!

606
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,679
I know what's best for you!

607
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:56,307
Cu!

608
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,728
Don't let them control you.

609
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:05,858
Now see what I've become
because of those terrible feelings.

610
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,988
I'm sick of feelings
that come bubbling up.

611
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,622
Excuse me.

612
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,624
Where was I now?

613
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,095
Cu!

614
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:28,223
Oh. Stubborn boy, where are you going?

615
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,726
Come down out of that, come here.

616
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,469
I'm coming, Cu.

617
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,722
There's nothing up there
that's any use to you.

618
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,570
You'd be better off calming down

619
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,396
and not getting too worked up, Ben.

620
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:47,951
Cu! You're standing on
the door. Get off it!

621
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:50,944
Let me help you.

622
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:00,662
Good boy!

623
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,166
Where's Saoirse?

624
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,710
Oh, no. Saoirse.

625
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:08,629
Wake up!

626
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,758
She did this to you?

627
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,761
You see how peaceful she is, Ben?

628
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:19,482
You see how I have
taken all her cares away?

629
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,943
She is just as a child should be,

630
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,478
without troubles, without worry.

631
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,980
There's got to be a way out.

632
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,444
Macha, please, please?
You don't understand.

633
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,115
If she doesn't sing
her song, she'll die.

634
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:39,044
So will you, and your son,
and all your kind.

635
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:43,580
Open the door! At once.
At once, I tell you!

636
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:52,214
Do excuse my little outburst.

637
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:58,303
If I can free your feelings,
then maybe...

638
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,273
Sorry, Cu.

639
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,484
Silly human child.

640
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:08,063
The jars are enchanted,
they cannot be broken by brute force.

641
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:13,110
The shell. It caused
the jars to break before.

642
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,198
There is no way out.

643
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,495
Open the door, human child.

644
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,623
Come here, Cu.
Keep the old witch quiet, will you?

645
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,628
Good boy.

646
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:36,592
Saoirse, I think you need to do it.

647
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,433
Let me in!

648
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,401
Saoirse?

649
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,695
It's going to be okay.

650
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:59,156
- Let me in!
- It's okay, Saoirse.

651
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,618
We don't have much time.

652
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,412
I shouldn't have been so mean to you.

653
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,332
It's not your fault, it never was.

654
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,710
I should've been
a better brother to you.

655
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:13,837
I'm sorry.

656
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:18,727
Let me in this minute!

657
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,289
That's it, Saoirse!

658
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,051
Let me in!

659
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:52,626
You're doing it.

660
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,089
That's it.

661
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,761
Come on, Saoirse!

662
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,235
Leave those jars alone.

663
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,477
That's it, Saoirse!

664
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,231
Stop it!

665
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,234
Stop it!

666
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,908
It's working, Saoirse.

667
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,744
Stop it. Stop it!

668
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,663
Stop it!

669
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,126
Stop it!

670
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,466
Stop!

671
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,949
You did it! You did it, Saoirse!

672
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:06,116
Saoirse!

673
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,492
Oh, no.

674
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:10,495
Oh, no, please stay awake,
Saoirse, please.

675
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:26,762
I have been so lost for so long.

676
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:28,690
Macha?

677
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,016
Please, forgive me.

678
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:35,062
I couldn't bear to see my son
suffering so much.

679
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:37,157
I couldn't bear it.

680
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:41,485
Please, Macha, my sister is sick.
Please, help us.

681
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,329
You poor thing.

682
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,591
What have I done?

683
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:57,584
I've wasted the precious
time you had left.

684
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:02,798
You must reunite her with her coat
before it's too late.

685
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:06,634
But we're still so far from home.
Do you have a car?

686
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:08,653
A car!

687
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:11,390
I have something better.

688
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,517
She's so gray.

689
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,361
Aye, you must be swift.

690
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,729
Climb on Cu's back with your sister.

691
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:21,566
You are a brave and loyal dog.

692
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:25,612
May the wind travel with you,
may your journey be swift,

693
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:30,909
for you carry the hope of all the Shee
with you this dawn. Go now!

694
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:42,263
Go, Cu, run!

695
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,109
Whoo-hoo!

696
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,863
Go, Cu!

697
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,328
Oh, they're gone.

698
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,159
No, stay awake, Saoirse.

699
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:56,453
Cu, go as quick as you can.

700
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,438
There's home.

701
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,675
It's going to be all right.

702
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,512
We're going to find your
coat and you'll be better.

703
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,440
Cu will stay with you.

704
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,397
Dad, where's Saoirse's coat?

705
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:07,867
Ben? What?

706
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,327
What are you doing here?

707
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:11,486
What did you do with Saoirse's coat?

708
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:13,655
Saoirse's what? Where is she?

709
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,709
She's up at the light. She needs it.

710
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,410
Saoirse.

711
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,961
Saoirse, no.

712
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:34,217
Dad! She needs her coat, Dad.

713
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,094
Stop it, Ben.

714
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:47,105
No, Dad. What did you do
with Saoirse's coat?

715
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,524
Ben, stop this.

716
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,411
She needs to get to a hospital.

717
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:54,080
Where is her coat?

718
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,780
It's gone, all right?

719
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,083
I threw it into the ocean.

720
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:58,700
I should've done it years ago.

721
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,327
Now, get in the boat!

722
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:30,815
I can get... I can get her coat back.

723
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,911
I can do this.

724
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,418
Sit down, Ben.

725
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,504
Ben?

726
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:56,466
Ben! Ben!

727
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,051
Ben!

728
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:04,391
Stay with her, Cu.

729
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,997
Ben! Ben!

730
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,113
Ben?

731
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:51,372
Saoirse?

732
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,417
She's a selkie

733
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:56,795
like Mum.

734
01:16:56,988 --> 01:16:58,254
Isn't she?

735
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,216
Yeah.

736
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:03,236
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

737
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,864
Ben?

738
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:12,871
Saoirse?

739
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:20,012
She's not getting better.

740
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,138
She has to sing.

741
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,807
I don't know if she can.

742
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:24,841
Try and copy me, Saoirse, okay?

743
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,859
Try it, Saoirse.

744
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:49,054
Between the here

745
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:54,050
Between the now

746
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:01,358
Between the north

747
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:04,936
Between the south

748
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:14,195
I am a selkie

749
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:19,251
A selkie of the sea

750
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,577
Wow! It's Mac Lir!

751
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:32,505
All truths will never bear

752
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:37,844
The promise

753
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:42,473
Of old

754
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:23,347
Dad, look.

755
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:05,681
Mum! Mum, please? Wait. Please, don't.

756
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,559
Please, don't take her from us.

757
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:21,957
Please, Mum.

758
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,574
She's all we have.

759
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,553
All of my kind must leave tonight.

760
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:37,880
But, Saoirse, you are part human.

761
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,636
If I take her coat,
our worlds will be untangled.

762
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:47,098
Mum...

763
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:50,768
And she can stay with you.

764
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:01,404
Mum, I want to stay.

765
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,492
Bronach.

766
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,871
I loved you so much.

767
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,290
I still do.

768
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:06,802
Can't you stay, too, Mum? Please?

769
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:14,852
My son.

770
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:19,658
Remember me, in your stories

771
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:21,400
and in your songs.

772
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:28,032
Know that I will always love you.

773
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:30,951
Always.

774
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:45,383
Bye.

775
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:59,031
It's as though I've been asleep,

776
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:00,731
all these years.

777
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,368
I'm so sorry.

778
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:04,568
I know, Dad.

779
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:07,748
Thank God! I thought
you were all killed.

780
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:10,908
Hold it.

781
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:12,535
Granny!

782
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,000
We're all right now, Mum.

783
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,504
We're all right now.

784
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,770
Ben, Dad, come on, quick!

785
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,781
Two seconds, we'll finish this off.

786
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:31,530
All right, make a wish
and blow them out on three.

787
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:35,868
One, two, three.

788
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:38,175
Hush now my Storeen

789
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:42,096
Close your eyes and sleep

790
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:45,557
Waltzing the waves

791
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:49,520
Diving the deep

792
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:53,399
Stars are shining bright

793
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:57,528
The wind is on the rise

794
01:31:57,804 --> 01:32:00,864
Whispering words

795
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:04,284
Of long-lost lullabies

796
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:08,163
Oh, won't you come with me?

797
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:11,875
Where the moon is made of gold

798
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:16,046
And in the morning sun

799
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:19,091
We'll be sailing

800
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:23,220
Oh, won't you come with me?

801
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,900
Where the ocean meets the sky

802
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,196
And as the clouds roll by

803
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:34,898
We'll sing the song of the sea

804
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:38,235
I had a dream last night

805
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:42,239
And heard the sweetest sound

806
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:45,826
I saw a great white light

807
01:32:46,436 --> 01:32:49,705
And dancers in the round

808
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,500
Castles in the sand

809
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:57,087
Cradles in the trees

810
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:02,760
Don't cry
I'll see you by and by

811
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:08,098
Oh, won't you come with me?

812
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,945
Where the moon is made of gold

813
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:15,773
And in the morning sun

814
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:19,234
We'll be sailing

815
01:33:19,386 --> 01:33:23,280
Oh, won't you come with me?

816
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:26,825
Where the ocean meets the sky

817
01:33:26,977 --> 01:33:31,080
And as the clouds roll by

818
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,085
We'll sing the song of the sea
