1
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:05,729
Like a fragrance floating in the breeze

2
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:08,732
A fragrance that is unspeaking

3
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:12,173
You live with it

4
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,232
I'm aware of it

5
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:16,867
Out in the open for the world to see

6
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:19,175
What is this unknown mystery?

7
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:05,241
Laila?

8
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:14,992
You'll forgot something?

9
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:37,412
I hate regrets.

10
00:02:40,088 --> 00:02:41,555
Then you shouldn't have any.

11
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:00,596
Bye.

12
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:24,332
Flying away in the open sky...

13
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:28,632
Are the birds of my dreams

14
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:34,205
Flying away...

15
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:39,642
To the land of my heart
are the birds of my dreams

16
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,189
Don't know where they'll go nest

17
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:58,392
Wings have taken flight and
now says my sight you've flnally awoken

18
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:04,065
What was on your mind is left behind
You've moved far ahead in time

19
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,033
Life is floating on a breeze

20
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:15,581
Life is telling you and me

21
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,389
Now whatever will be will be

22
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:06,399
A touch from someone
and I've been wandering without a thought

23
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:12,874
Somewhere new words were spoken
and since then I've been lost

24
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:17,902
Something made the heart melt

25
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:23,414
In a blink, I was someone else

26
00:05:26,821 --> 00:05:31,019
Now whatever will be will be

27
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:48,909
A light shone down
Now there's a beauty being showered on the streets

28
00:05:51,846 --> 00:06:00,379
Happiness came down
Now there's a zest being showered upon me

29
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:08,059
Now I flnally know who I was meant to be

30
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:17,233
Do you remember that moment yesterday
The one with the magic force?

31
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:23,369
It transformed us into something new
I wonder which moment it was?

32
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:27,278
The heart says just blindly go to

33
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,816
Any place that desire takes you

34
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:43,421
Now whatever will be will be

35
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,729
What do you mean,
you've quit your job?

36
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:16,464
What do you mean,
you've quit your job?

37
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:17,698
Meaning?

38
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,859
We're getting married in two months.

39
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:22,164
So? You can resume after the wedding.

40
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:24,161
How?

41
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,197
First, we'll go on the honeymoon...

42
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:28,876
then I want to redo the house.

43
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:31,071
That will take about a year.

44
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:34,215
And if you're going
to Singapore for your new project...

45
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,046
I'll be coming with you.

46
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:39,620
But...

47
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,952
that hotel is your dream project, Natasha.

48
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,814
Dreams change baby.

49
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,829
Then, I didn't know I'd be getting married.

50
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:48,796
Married?

51
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:51,862
What does marriage have to do with it?

52
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:53,868
What do you mean?

53
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:55,495
Obviously, priorities change.

54
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:59,864
After the wedding, even you wouldn't
want to go on this kind of boys holiday

55
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,280
- When is her flight?
- At 6 p.m.

56
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:19,490
Don't worry man, we'll make it.

57
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:21,491
Yeah.

58
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:28,394
Very funny!

59
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:32,369
All okay, babe?

60
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:33,702
Yeah.

61
00:08:34,475 --> 00:08:35,669
Can I drive?

62
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,408
Can you drive?

63
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,626
Babe, the speed limit is 120.
You can go faster.

64
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,787
Yes, we may just miss that flight.

65
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:56,429
I'm not going to drive rashly.

66
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,991
Watch out!

67
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,094
Please keep your eyes on the road, please!

68
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,672
Then tell him not to talk to me.

69
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,003
Don't talk to her.

70
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:12,338
I love this song.

71
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:19,510
Rock chick in a hard rock world...

72
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,583
I'm a rock chick in a hard rock world...

73
00:09:29,764 --> 00:09:33,791
Nothing rocks better than a rock chick girl...

74
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:40,904
I'm a rock chick in a hard rock world...

75
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:46,206
I had fun.

76
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,514
Listen...

77
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:55,279
I'm sorry.

78
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,655
Me too.

79
00:09:58,426 --> 00:09:59,654
Bye Bagwati.

80
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:11,368
Tell me...

81
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,939
what do you think about them?

82
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:19,870
- Kabir is not himself when Natasha is around.
- That's what I thought.

83
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:21,378
Correct.

84
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,515
I sense some tension.

85
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:27,352
Did you speak with him?

86
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:29,984
Why should I?

87
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,419
If a friend doesn't address
a personal problem, then who will?

88
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:36,497
Forget it man!

89
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,829
They'll sort their problem
and we'll get screwed in the middle.

90
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:39,830
Chee, man!

91
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,303
You are seriously shameless.

92
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,167
What?

93
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:47,375
Look... he is our friend.

94
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,275
When he is back,
let's talk to him.

95
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:52,341
Okay?

96
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:54,838
Okay.

97
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:18,032
God!

98
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:19,831
Now what has he done?

99
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:24,001
He's buried inside his diary again.
He's too boring.

100
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,072
What do you write in it?

101
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:27,510
It's private.

102
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:29,448
Rascal...

103
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:31,414
you've always been secretive.

104
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:34,789
- But there's nothing to tell.
- No, no, no!

105
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:37,019
You're obviously struggling
with an emotional problem.

106
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,854
What? Me?

107
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:41,095
Arjun...

108
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:42,963
I truly believe that...

109
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:46,956
if a friend doesn't address
a personal problem, then who will?

110
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:50,171
- Continue.
- Yes, absolutely.

111
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:52,571
To figure out the problem
we have to do a test.

112
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,475
- I'll say a word.
- Okay.

113
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:58,536
And you have to say the first thing
that comes to your mind.

114
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:00,214
Without deliberating.

115
00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:01,579
- Alright?
- Okay.

116
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:03,310
- Ready, doctor.
- Fine.

117
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:04,718
Car.

118
00:12:04,952 --> 00:12:05,853
Road.

119
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:06,820
Arjun.

120
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:07,985
Brother.

121
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:09,019
Diary.

122
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,924
Poetry.

123
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:10,791
Heart.

124
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,348
Love.

125
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:12,293
Mumbai.

126
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:13,160
Traffic.

127
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,218
Father.

128
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,997
- Father?
- Mother.

129
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,226
According to my test...

130
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:25,206
your father is the root of
your emotional problem.

131
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:26,764
And you're keeping this from the world.

132
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:31,712
And, in my opinion,
Dr. Sigmund Fraud...

133
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:35,409
it's time to shred your degree.
Please stop practicing, please!

134
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:37,173
You hurt my feelings, man.

135
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:49,425
My bwoys!

136
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:52,924
If you want a view,
look that way.

137
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,537
We should talk to him.

138
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:13,687
Natasha is really sweet.
It was really nice to meet her.

139
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:17,316
Yeah... even she was glad
to have met you.

140
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:21,555
Kabir...

141
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:26,431
- are you happy?
- Yes.

142
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:33,471
Why... are you asking like this?

143
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,705
I don't know man. Listen...

144
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,641
it's possible I may be wrong.

145
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,547
But, we are friends.
And I just...

146
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,746
I just have to ask you.

147
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:52,793
Are you happy with Natasha?

148
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:58,226
Dude, you just met her.
And the poor girl was a bit tense.

149
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:01,559
She thought there was something
between Laila and me.

150
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:04,202
Yeah.

151
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:07,965
But, now there's no problem.
Thanks to you, my bwoys!

152
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:10,271
Okay?

153
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:11,538
She's sweet.

154
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:13,707
Imran, you've met her.
You spent time with her.

155
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:14,645
Tell him.

156
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,346
Yes, she is very sweet.

157
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:21,689
Well that's good, man.

158
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:22,519
I'm happy for you.

159
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:29,819
Hey... here's an extra pillow!

160
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,162
Good night, bwoys.

161
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:38,531
Good night.

162
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:56,881
Guys, do you mind
if we take a detour?

163
00:14:57,925 --> 00:14:58,721
Why?

164
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,990
There is an artist, Salman Habib.

165
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:04,331
He lives around here.
The lady at the gallery told me.

166
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:06,390
That he sells his paintings from home.

167
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:08,068
Really?

168
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:10,067
Sounds good.

169
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:12,435
Anyway, I'm a bit bored
hanging with just the two of you.

170
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,351
The map says we should take
the next right for Grazalema.

171
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:35,095
- Salman Habib.

172
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:37,222
- You'll find Indians in
every corner of the world.

173
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:39,990
- Really, man. We're everywhere!

174
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:43,099
Grazalema. Turn right over here.

175
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:54,738
- Dude, I said right.
- Forget it.

176
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:58,352
Don't feel like it.
Let's go to Seville.

177
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:00,752
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

178
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:02,789
We can go on the way back.
It's okay.

179
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:05,058
Okay!

180
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:10,061
It's time to see
what I've planned for us.

181
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:17,470
Check it out, bwoys!

182
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:21,170
Look at that guys!

183
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:25,244
- Arjun, my pal. You rock!
- Look at that dude!

184
00:16:25,312 --> 00:16:26,870
- Wow!
- You b******!

185
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:29,116
You're purposely doing this.

186
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:30,818
You know I'm scared of heights.

187
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:32,046
Don't be silly.

188
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,177
I want to do this.
It's my dream.

189
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:35,881
- Yeah right!
- Just imagine...

190
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:39,785
jumping from 15,000 feet
and flying towards the earth.

191
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,887
That's not flying, that's falling.

192
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,797
It will be fun.

193
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:45,187
Relax.

194
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,267
Remember he eventually enjoyed diving.

195
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:48,002
- Correct.
- Big deal.

196
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:50,368
With a beautiful instructor
like Laila, who wouldn't!

197
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,870
You never know,
you also might get lucky.

198
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:56,610
You people ready to
jump out of a plane?

199
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,599
- Oh yeah!

200
00:16:57,845 --> 00:17:00,405
Are you ready to enter the air?

201
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:01,770
Yeah!

202
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,521
Head up. Eyes to the horizon.

203
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:09,250
Legs at 45 degrees.

204
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:12,053
Arch! Arch!

205
00:17:15,863 --> 00:17:17,262
- Did I say relax?
- No.

206
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:21,358
I said arch.
I didn't say relax.

207
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:34,971
These are total malfunctions.

208
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:38,452
In case of a total malfunction
what you have to do is this.

209
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:40,613
Cut away your main and
deploy your reserve.

210
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:42,715
What is that?
You have a malfunction.

211
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:47,828
Cut away my main and
deploy my reserve.

212
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:49,159
What are you doing?

213
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:52,522
- It's a broken line.
- Are you sure it's a broken line?

214
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:56,597
Scissor kick... scissor kick...

215
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:58,599
Cut! Deploy!

216
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:00,470
Perfect!

217
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:06,171
What's this?

218
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:07,548
Waiver form.

219
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:08,276
Waiver form?

220
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:11,681
If something happens to us... like death,
these guys aren't responsible.

221
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:13,320
We are responsible for it.

222
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,048
What?

223
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:18,849
I'll see you outside.

224
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:56,459
- I'm feeling sick.
- What?

225
00:18:58,098 --> 00:18:59,463
I'm going to throw up.

226
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:04,336
I'm scared too.

227
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:06,630
But that's why we are here.

228
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:10,400
Everybody get ready.

229
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:11,871
Okay!

230
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:22,713
Alright, guys. This is it!

231
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:44,166
Bye!

232
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,208
Dude!

233
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:52,652
I'm next.

234
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:55,614
Adios amigo!

235
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:58,885
See you downstairs!

236
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:13,962
Let go, lmran.

237
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:17,871
Just let it all go!

238
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:49,007
Push me!

239
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:46,630
Come on, lmran!

240
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,796
Lmran!

241
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,507
Who are you?
Where have you been?

242
00:24:18,151 --> 00:24:20,711
I've moved the heaven and the earth
but I couldn't flnd you

243
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:25,288
But you arrive today,
so suddenly

244
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:28,885
And you give meaning to
my whole life with your love

245
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:31,223
I don't understand

246
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,426
I don't know

247
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,667
What you've said to me, Señorita

248
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,828
Even then, I have no idea why

249
00:24:41,608 --> 00:24:44,805
I like what I heard, Señorita

250
00:24:55,322 --> 00:24:57,654
Don't look away

251
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,520
Stay close to me

252
00:25:03,196 --> 00:25:05,756
Take me in your arms

253
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:09,029
Hope you've understood Señorita

254
00:25:10,036 --> 00:25:13,164
Even a few moments of love

255
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:17,677
Are never too less

256
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:20,805
Come let's lose ourselves in them

257
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:24,848
And forget we ever knew sadness

258
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:28,718
Señorita, listen to us
Señorita, d'you hear what we're saying

259
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:32,617
I will never understand

260
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,720
The meaning of the words
you dedicate to me

261
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:40,233
But the warmth of your gaze

262
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:44,699
Makes me feel like
the most beautiful Señorita

263
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:49,342
Our eyes looked at each other

264
00:25:49,342 --> 00:25:52,243
And recounted tales of desire Señorita

265
00:25:52,946 --> 00:25:56,746
That for affection and for love

266
00:25:56,983 --> 00:26:01,283
There is only one language
in the world Señorita

267
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:04,188
Don't look away from me now

268
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:07,820
Come closer to me

269
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:12,262
Take me in your arms

270
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:16,032
Hope you've understood Señorita

271
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:19,560
Even a few moments of love

272
00:26:21,107 --> 00:26:23,473
Are never too less

273
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:27,844
Come let's lose ourselves in them

274
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:31,318
And forget we ever knew sadness

275
00:26:31,318 --> 00:26:35,687
Señorita, listen to us
Señorita, d'you hear what we're saying

276
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,621
With every moment that has passed

277
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:50,830
Oh Señorita

278
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:55,372
You've managed to win my heart

279
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:57,640
And that's all there is to it

280
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:00,370
Don't look away

281
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:04,443
Stay close to me

282
00:27:05,986 --> 00:27:08,352
Take me in your arms

283
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:12,314
Hope you've understood Señorita

284
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:15,818
Even a few moments of love

285
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:19,722
Are never too less

286
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,127
Come let's lose ourselves in them

287
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:27,837
And forget we ever knew sadness

288
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:10,077
Remember before cable TV
we only had one national channel?

289
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:14,843
And every Sunday
they showed a Hindi film.

290
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,883
Get to the point.

291
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,383
The point is...

292
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:23,320
before the film there was this animation.

293
00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:26,855
A white circle went round and round
and formed the channel logo.

294
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:30,663
Do you remember the tune?

295
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:51,687
Brilliant!

296
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:05,734
That tune never failed to depress me.

297
00:29:06,806 --> 00:29:07,795
Depressed.

298
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:11,237
I'm feeling the same right now.

299
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,473
Weekend's over and school begins.

300
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:19,853
- And you wanted to cancel this trip!
- I know, man!

301
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,081
Can you imagine?

302
00:29:25,091 --> 00:29:26,217
You know what that means?

303
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:28,922
It means...

304
00:29:30,096 --> 00:29:32,257
that everything is predestined.

305
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:35,992
Everything!

306
00:29:37,103 --> 00:29:40,561
This holiday was in our destiny.

307
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:42,742
You know!

308
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:47,342
You, me and asshole.

309
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:50,309
- Cheers asshole.
- Where's asshole?

310
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:52,975
Cheers!

311
00:29:55,855 --> 00:29:57,345
Laila too.

312
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:03,554
I was meant to meet her.

313
00:30:04,864 --> 00:30:06,229
You are in louw, my bwoy.

314
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:08,159
No, man!

315
00:30:08,668 --> 00:30:10,033
You are in louw...

316
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,038
- You are in louw...

317
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:14,905
- You are in louw...
- Kabir, man!

318
00:30:14,974 --> 00:30:17,340
Everything is written.
Listen to me.

319
00:30:17,544 --> 00:30:19,034
It's all predestined.

320
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,113
You know what I'm saying?

321
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:22,282
This moment... us right now...

322
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:23,750
it's predestined.

323
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,308
Predestined.

324
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:28,110
Please stop saying, 'predestined... '!

325
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:29,945
I beg of you!

326
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:32,959
This too is predestined.
It's all written.

327
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,961
Alright, we get it.

328
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:36,861
Listen, we get it, zip!

329
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,090
Come on, man!

330
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:40,766
It's true.

331
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:43,036
It's predestined...

332
00:30:43,036 --> 00:30:43,934
Guys...

333
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:56,479
Hola...

334
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:10,418
Guys, watch out!

335
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:14,257
What the hell, guys?

336
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,936
Yes?

337
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,360
- Our man is back.
- Their mobiles are switched off.

338
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,349
- What?
- Yup.

339
00:31:41,427 --> 00:31:42,528
Even Nuria's?

340
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:44,086
Yes, I'm shocked.

341
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:47,223
When she knew we'd land up in jail,
she should've kept the phone switched on

342
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,603
If our bail isn't posted...

343
00:31:50,603 --> 00:31:53,128
we'll be stuck here for days.

344
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:58,641
Arjun...

345
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:02,110
tell them I want to make a call.

346
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:04,275
To whom?

347
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:06,579
Salman Habib.

348
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:08,110
The artist?

349
00:32:09,956 --> 00:32:10,650
Yeah.

350
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:13,822
Why will he come to post our bail?

351
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:16,755
Are you alright?

352
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,033
Just because we can't reach anyone,
he's losing it.

353
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,091
He's my father.

354
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:22,662
What?

355
00:32:25,138 --> 00:32:26,264
I am his son.

356
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:37,810
Just let it go lmran.

357
00:32:40,486 --> 00:32:41,544
Just let it go.

358
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:42,780
- Hello...

359
00:32:44,157 --> 00:32:45,525
Hello, may I...

360
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:47,686
speak with Mr. Salman Habib, please?

361
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:49,156
- Yes?

362
00:32:50,797 --> 00:32:52,526
Sir, I am lmran.

363
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:56,958
I am Rahila's son.

364
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:02,741
When did you find out?

365
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:07,945
Afew days after Abu died.

366
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,208
In his stuff, I found a letter
that Ammi had written to him.

367
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:17,384
The letter stated that...

368
00:33:17,457 --> 00:33:23,157
Ammi was grateful that Abu had
accepted her and her unborn child.

369
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:28,057
Why didn't you tell us?

370
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:32,435
I was a bit shaken up.

371
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:36,698
What would I tell you?
Abu is not my father.

372
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:41,313
He loved you a lot.

373
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:44,476
He really loved you.

374
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:47,750
And us.

375
00:33:48,454 --> 00:33:50,456
I mean, think about it.

376
00:33:50,456 --> 00:33:52,992
Be it sports day or
parent-teacher meetings...

377
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:56,325
our fathers seldom came,
but Abu was always there.

378
00:33:57,964 --> 00:34:00,159
Well, my father was dead.

379
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,999
So, if he showed up for sports day
it would've been a bit strange.

380
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:12,342
- You've got bail.

381
00:34:15,615 --> 00:34:16,912
They're here.

382
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:29,492
Hi.

383
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:33,328
Imran.

384
00:34:35,535 --> 00:34:36,502
Imran...

385
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,634
I'm Salman.

386
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:45,378
My friends, Arjun and Kabir.

387
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:46,572
- Hello.
- Thank you.

388
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:47,943
Hi... thank you.

389
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:50,872
You three look pretty hungover.

390
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:56,985
You're welcome to come over to
my place and freshen up.

391
00:34:57,657 --> 00:35:00,387
Our bags and car are at the hotel.

392
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:01,992
I'll drive you there.

393
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,524
Come.

394
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:21,537
- Wow, this is beautiful.

395
00:35:23,282 --> 00:35:24,306
It's really nice.

396
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:27,713
Are you always so polite?

397
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:32,487
It's absolute rubbish.
Anyone can do that.

398
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:35,795
This gentleman, my neighbour...

399
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:38,998
was obsessed with having his wife
immortalised in a potrait.

400
00:35:38,998 --> 00:35:42,525
So, I applied my brush
and fulfilled his desire.

401
00:35:42,602 --> 00:35:44,934
And with his money, paid my bills.

402
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:49,638
So, what are you guys doing in Seville?

403
00:35:50,343 --> 00:35:51,711
Skydiving.

404
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:52,871
- Really?
- Yeah.

405
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,072
So, you jumped out of a plane
and landed in jail?

406
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:57,714
You could say that.

407
00:35:58,184 --> 00:36:02,314
That apart, what do you do?

408
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:04,916
Well, I'm a financial broker.

409
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:06,258
In London.

410
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:07,817
Money man.

411
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:09,990
And you?

412
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,325
My family is in the construction business.

413
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:15,732
Well, never mind.
Everyone makes mistakes.

414
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:17,498
That's funny.

415
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:20,128
You're a Xerox copy of him.

416
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:25,538
And, what about you?

417
00:36:26,946 --> 00:36:27,844
I write.

418
00:36:29,515 --> 00:36:30,072
What?

419
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,679
I'm a copywriter in advertising.

420
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:36,813
Writing copy for ads is like
a buffet for the masses.

421
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,886
For instance, this painting is
for someone else.

422
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:44,125
Do you write anything
to feed your own soul?

423
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,162
I do.

424
00:36:51,971 --> 00:36:52,460
Sir?

425
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:53,668
Salman.

426
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:56,102
Right. We'll be outside.

427
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:16,756
Your hands are very similar to mine.

428
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,133
Sit.

429
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,768
Do you live alone?

430
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:27,239
No.

431
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,804
I have a wife.

432
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:31,302
But she is away... in Paris.

433
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:32,505
Sit.

434
00:37:35,615 --> 00:37:36,547
And any...

435
00:37:36,782 --> 00:37:37,942
children?

436
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:45,751
Do you ever come to India?

437
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:47,860
Yes.

438
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,727
I was there four years ago
when my mother passed away.

439
00:37:52,098 --> 00:37:53,799
- Sorry.
- I have a brother there...

440
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:54,766
but...

441
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:57,666
we don't meet.

442
00:38:03,276 --> 00:38:05,642
I've often thought about you.

443
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:08,637
I mean...

444
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:14,576
that someday, somewhere we might meet.

445
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:18,691
But I never figured...

446
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:21,251
what I would say to you.

447
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:24,088
Just say the truth.

448
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:29,061
The truth... what is the truth?

449
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:32,863
Everyone has their own version.

450
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,379
Look... I was...

451
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:42,244
25 then.

452
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:46,385
Rahila was a few years younger.

453
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:50,523
When you're young
the future doesn't matter.

454
00:38:50,523 --> 00:38:52,150
We were just kids.

455
00:38:54,794 --> 00:38:56,853
One day...

456
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:59,420
Rahila told me that she's...

457
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:02,899
expecting a baby.

458
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:05,869
I wasrt ready for
the responsibility then.

459
00:39:05,938 --> 00:39:07,838
And nor am I now.

460
00:39:14,347 --> 00:39:17,282
So... you just abandoned her?

461
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:24,145
I guess, you could say that.

462
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:33,856
Rahila wanted a family,
she wanted to be a mother.

463
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,795
I had other dreams.
I wanted to be an artist.

464
00:39:38,804 --> 00:39:40,806
I wanted to paint...

465
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:42,273
travel the world.

466
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:46,212
I loved her but...

467
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:49,238
she made her choice
and I made mine.

468
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:51,112
That's all.

469
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,250
I found out about you
only last year.

470
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:02,160
But...

471
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:06,491
you've always known about me.

472
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:10,996
Did you never want to see me?

473
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:15,039
I thought it was better this way.

474
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:25,506
You asked for the truth.

475
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:28,045
Well, this is it.

476
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,155
I... am sorry, lmran.

477
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:35,117
No, you're not.

478
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:42,432
Is there something
I can do for you?

479
00:40:44,003 --> 00:40:46,995
Apologise only when it comes from here.

480
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:13,231
When clouds of pain loom in the sky

481
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:16,902
When a shadow of sadness flickers by

482
00:41:17,703 --> 00:41:20,672
When a tear flnds it's way to the eye

483
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,009
When fear keeps the loneliness alive

484
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,648
I try and console my heart
Why is it that you cry? I ask

485
00:41:29,648 --> 00:41:32,173
This is only what life imparts

486
00:41:32,918 --> 00:41:35,318
These deep silences within

487
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:38,449
Have been handed out to all by time

488
00:41:39,692 --> 00:41:42,183
Everyone's story has a little sorrow

489
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:45,423
Everyone's share has a little Sunshine

490
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:48,858
No need for water in your eyes

491
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:52,567
Every moment can be a new life

492
00:41:53,973 --> 00:41:56,168
Why do you let them pass you by

493
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:59,611
Oh heart, why is it that you cry?

494
00:42:08,854 --> 00:42:10,014
Morning...

495
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:17,286
Did you sleep or not?

496
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:19,659
No.

497
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:31,469
I think, we should get going.

498
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,167
Let's go.

499
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:36,239
Arjun...

500
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:42,250
I'm really sorry.

501
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:08,204
I'll see you at the car.

502
00:43:08,447 --> 00:43:09,277
Yeah.

503
00:43:13,419 --> 00:43:15,319
What do you mean,
'you slept in the car'?

504
00:43:16,088 --> 00:43:17,385
Long story, babe.

505
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:19,481
Tell me, what happened?

506
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:22,727
Well, lmran just...

507
00:43:24,663 --> 00:43:25,823
I'll tell you later, okay.

508
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:28,428
Why? Tell me now,
what happened?

509
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:31,736
I can't tell you right now.
I'll tell you when I'm back.

510
00:43:32,104 --> 00:43:33,571
Why are you getting irritated?

511
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,704
Why are you going on about it?

512
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:37,238
Okay, forget it.

513
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,612
See.

514
00:43:42,982 --> 00:43:44,609
It's our wedding card.
Can you see it?

515
00:43:45,017 --> 00:43:46,416
Isn't it gorgeous?

516
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:48,579
I'm just so happy with it.

517
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:52,024
Oh... I've emailed a few options
for your suit.

518
00:43:52,024 --> 00:43:54,720
Please select one. Okay?
Don't forget.

519
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:56,092
Okay.

520
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,525
You are so far away.

521
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:03,301
You love me, right?

522
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,637
Yeah.

523
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:08,203
Then stop fighting with me.

524
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:12,169
Everything was fine before you
went on this holiday.

525
00:44:12,845 --> 00:44:14,642
Kabir, just come home.

526
00:44:15,147 --> 00:44:18,583
To me, your family, your friends.

527
00:44:18,984 --> 00:44:20,781
My friends are with me.

528
00:44:21,086 --> 00:44:23,054
Yeah, I know.
But you know what I mean.

529
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:41,539
Happy birthday to you...

530
00:44:42,508 --> 00:44:46,137
Happy birthday dear Anjali...

531
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:49,337
Happy birthday to you...

532
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:56,886
Oh my God!

533
00:44:57,923 --> 00:44:59,117
It's beautiful!

534
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:00,549
- Nice, right?
- Yes!

535
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:03,525
Tanya?

536
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:14,832
What are you doing, baby?

537
00:45:15,441 --> 00:45:16,840
I'm sorry, I'm so happy.

538
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:19,539
Kabir just proposed to Natasha.

539
00:45:19,611 --> 00:45:20,846
- What??

540
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:22,848
Oh my God!

541
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:25,517
You could've waited until
your mother had cut the cake.

542
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:28,509
Kabir, this is the best birthday gift, ever!

543
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:29,688
I love you, son.

544
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:30,746
- The shy guy!

545
00:45:31,423 --> 00:45:33,525
- It's a double celebration.

546
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:34,992
I'm so happy.

547
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:36,750
Now you have to call me 'mummy'.

548
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:40,128
- Get some champagne!

549
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:43,324
Come here.

550
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:47,237
Very good decision.

551
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:51,443
I'm so happy.

552
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:55,236
Babe, what just happened in there?

553
00:45:55,314 --> 00:45:57,612
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

554
00:45:58,117 --> 00:45:59,852
This ring...

555
00:45:59,852 --> 00:46:01,251
I got it for my mom.

556
00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:05,052
It's her birthday gift.

557
00:46:05,657 --> 00:46:06,715
This is for your mom?

558
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,226
Look at it sweety...
it's a mummy ring.

559
00:46:10,295 --> 00:46:11,697
What?

560
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:13,062
Why didn't you say something?

561
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:15,056
I tried.

562
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:19,036
But you were excited and screaming.
And Tanya made an announcement.

563
00:46:19,705 --> 00:46:21,866
So you don't want to marry me?

564
00:46:22,307 --> 00:46:25,834
It's not about you.
I haven't even thought about marriage.

565
00:46:28,514 --> 00:46:30,311
What do I tell my father?

566
00:46:35,287 --> 00:46:38,190
We'll say that
we gave it some more thought and...

567
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,590
we need more time.
That's all.

568
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:42,286
This is so embarrassing.

569
00:46:43,128 --> 00:46:45,187
I'm so sorry, sweety.

570
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:48,827
You don't ever want to marry me?

571
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:51,937
It's not like that.

572
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:54,462
If it is, you better tell me right now!

573
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:58,477
I really love you, Kabir.
And I don't...

574
00:46:58,477 --> 00:47:01,708
No, no... no sweety.
Don't cry.

575
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,712
Not now.

576
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:10,816
Kabir...

577
00:47:12,758 --> 00:47:16,455
are you even serious
about this relationship or not?

578
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:20,628
You know what...

579
00:47:31,677 --> 00:47:32,701
Will you marry me?

580
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:57,893
Who is it?

581
00:48:12,784 --> 00:48:13,648
Room service.

582
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:15,478
Laila?

583
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:17,545
Hi!

584
00:48:17,623 --> 00:48:18,453
Oh my God!

585
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,325
You're here... how... I mean...

586
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,456
Imran called and
he begged me to come.

587
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:25,990
- So I came.
- Imran?

588
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:27,489
I knew it.

589
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,724
He is my best friend.

590
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:35,032
I am... so glad you're here.

591
00:48:36,475 --> 00:48:38,136
I'm glad you are glad.

592
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:42,973
Hello... my the two the love the birds!

593
00:48:43,448 --> 00:48:44,779
Hello!

594
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:45,975
Surprised, Arjun?

595
00:48:47,286 --> 00:48:48,344
Thank you.

596
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,821
It's good to see you.

597
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:51,015
- And you.
- Hey gorgeous.

598
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:53,158
- I love you too.
- Nice to have you back.

599
00:48:53,158 --> 00:48:54,523
You got a tan!

600
00:48:55,294 --> 00:48:56,295
Get dressed, soon!

601
00:48:56,295 --> 00:48:57,629
- We had to leave at seven.
- Correct.

602
00:48:57,629 --> 00:48:58,830
- Two minutes?
- You missed me?

603
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,499
I always miss you, darling.

604
00:49:00,499 --> 00:49:01,523
Where are we going?

605
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,227
It's a surprise.
Can't tell you in front of him.

606
00:49:21,286 --> 00:49:22,446
What's going on?

607
00:49:22,854 --> 00:49:23,912
What do you mean?

608
00:49:24,156 --> 00:49:25,214
It's San Fermin.

609
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,325
Running with the bulls.

610
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:27,724
- Really?
- Didrt you know?

611
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:28,919
Just follow me...

612
00:49:37,202 --> 00:49:38,260
Holy shit!

613
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,937
Are these guys mad?
What are they doing?

614
00:49:47,179 --> 00:49:47,975
Suicide.

615
00:49:48,513 --> 00:49:49,878
Isn't that why you are here?

616
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:02,651
I felt this should be the
last experience of our trip.

617
00:50:03,362 --> 00:50:05,830
This could be the
last experience of our life!

618
00:50:06,164 --> 00:50:08,333
Stop it, Arjun.
Let's grab a bite.

619
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:08,890
Come on.

620
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:11,036
- Excuse me.
- Dude are you...

621
00:50:11,036 --> 00:50:12,264
- I'm starving!

622
00:50:13,872 --> 00:50:15,362
This is not an adventure sport.

623
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:17,338
I object, Judge sahab!

624
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:20,145
I agree it's not as safe as regular sports.

625
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:21,713
And is illegal in some countries.

626
00:50:21,713 --> 00:50:24,511
But according to the
Spanish tradition and culture...

627
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:25,517
it is allowed.

628
00:50:25,517 --> 00:50:27,508
And technically,
according to our deal...

629
00:50:27,586 --> 00:50:29,986
we can choose any sport, remember?

630
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:31,823
Lmran, it's really dangerous, you know.

631
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:34,018
Yes, those bulls could kill us, alright?

632
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:36,928
We'll be dangling on their horns
like tandoori chicken on skewers!

633
00:50:36,928 --> 00:50:38,657
Precisely the point.

634
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:41,857
You want to get rid of
the fear within you?

635
00:50:42,134 --> 00:50:44,295
Well then, here's
our deepest fear. Death.

636
00:50:45,337 --> 00:50:46,361
Let's face it.

637
00:50:46,972 --> 00:50:48,340
Because beyond this fear...

638
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,238
lies victory!

639
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:51,332
Please spare us the tag lines!

640
00:50:51,777 --> 00:50:53,472
Dude, think about it!

641
00:50:53,712 --> 00:50:57,341
No training, no instructors.
Just us, my amigos!

642
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:59,880
And some bulls running after us.

643
00:51:00,118 --> 00:51:02,416
If you want to live... just run!

644
00:51:02,821 --> 00:51:04,982
Laila, do you know
any psychiatrist around here?

645
00:51:05,757 --> 00:51:07,987
Because our amigo has
completely lost it!

646
00:51:08,827 --> 00:51:10,852
I'll be at the starting line
at seven tomorrow morning.

647
00:51:11,496 --> 00:51:13,464
With or without you.

648
00:51:19,004 --> 00:51:19,404
I have something for you, lmran.

649
00:51:19,404 --> 00:51:20,393
I have something for you, lmran.

650
00:51:21,273 --> 00:51:22,103
It's from Nuria.

651
00:51:25,877 --> 00:51:26,673
It's in Spanish.

652
00:51:27,646 --> 00:51:28,908
Love has no language.

653
00:51:29,514 --> 00:51:30,208
So true.

654
00:51:33,251 --> 00:51:34,582
I think you should
buy her something.

655
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,250
You're absolutely right.

656
00:51:36,822 --> 00:51:38,380
Guys... next stop - shopping.

657
00:51:39,825 --> 00:51:41,383
Count me out,
I'm going back to the hotel.

658
00:51:42,461 --> 00:51:43,587
Are you alright?

659
00:51:45,964 --> 00:51:46,794
I'm fine.

660
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,634
That we'll only know after a test.

661
00:51:50,502 --> 00:51:51,298
Test?

662
00:51:52,537 --> 00:51:53,765
What do you say, Dr. Fraud?

663
00:51:54,673 --> 00:51:55,367
Are you game?

664
00:51:55,974 --> 00:51:56,702
Bring it on.

665
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:58,569
You have to say the first thing...

666
00:51:58,643 --> 00:52:00,611
I know the drill. Ask!

667
00:52:01,513 --> 00:52:02,241
Black.

668
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:03,038
Night.

669
00:52:03,115 --> 00:52:03,979
Sea.

670
00:52:04,149 --> 00:52:04,877
Salty.

671
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:05,784
Work.

672
00:52:05,784 --> 00:52:06,785
Money.

673
00:52:06,785 --> 00:52:07,649
Sex.

674
00:52:07,853 --> 00:52:08,687
I like!

675
00:52:08,687 --> 00:52:09,210
Friend.

676
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:10,316
You.

677
00:52:10,522 --> 00:52:11,489
Marriage.

678
00:52:12,824 --> 00:52:13,984
Family.

679
00:52:20,832 --> 00:52:21,662
What?

680
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:24,970
Is that all?

681
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:26,267
It was enough.

682
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,808
Smartass...

683
00:52:29,808 --> 00:52:33,505
You're using my trick on me?
Just say what you want to.

684
00:52:34,045 --> 00:52:34,943
Okay.

685
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,080
You hesitated on 'marriage'.

686
00:52:38,517 --> 00:52:39,916
So?

687
00:52:39,985 --> 00:52:43,443
I'm just saying...
you hesitated... on marriage.

688
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:48,289
Look...

689
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:52,821
I don't have the time for this crap.
See you later.

690
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:59,229
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, I'm going to...

691
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:08,112
Kabir.

692
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:14,047
Go!

693
00:53:16,955 --> 00:53:18,081
Kabir!

694
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:20,557
Kabir... man, just stop!

695
00:53:21,259 --> 00:53:22,385
What?

696
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:25,360
Talk to us man.
What's going on?

697
00:53:25,764 --> 00:53:27,629
It's nothing, really.

698
00:53:29,601 --> 00:53:30,568
Kabir...

699
00:53:32,537 --> 00:53:34,835
Look, I'm sorry I lost my cool.

700
00:53:36,141 --> 00:53:38,473
Because I said you have
a problem with marriage?

701
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:42,609
I guess, I'm freaking out.
I don't know what's happening.

702
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:45,350
It's normal to be nervous.

703
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,852
It's not like you're having
an arranged marriage.

704
00:53:47,852 --> 00:53:50,514
Yeah, but she isn't
the same person I met.

705
00:53:51,189 --> 00:53:53,350
She's changed,
she's become possessive.

706
00:53:53,959 --> 00:53:57,258
The girl I knew was a
talented, independent interior designer.

707
00:53:57,429 --> 00:53:59,464
She enjoyed her work.

708
00:53:59,464 --> 00:54:00,431
But now...

709
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:02,967
she's bid adieu to her passion and...

710
00:54:03,201 --> 00:54:05,101
taken over my life.

711
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:08,039
Of course, I want a partner but...

712
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:09,734
I want my own life too!

713
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:13,841
The whole two bodies, one soul thing
I won't be able to handle it.

714
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:26,513
- May I ask you something?
- Yes.

715
00:54:27,826 --> 00:54:30,056
Don't you think
you proposed to her too soon?

716
00:54:30,795 --> 00:54:32,964
Actually, I didn't even propose.

717
00:54:32,964 --> 00:54:34,532
- What?

718
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:36,864
I'd bought a ring for my mom
as a birthday gift.

719
00:54:37,135 --> 00:54:40,536
Before giving it, I happened to show
it to Natasha and she thought...

720
00:54:40,972 --> 00:54:42,439
it was meant for her.

721
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:45,904
- Are you crazy?
- What are you doing?

722
00:54:46,378 --> 00:54:48,175
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

723
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:55,851
No wonder this vacation was
so important for you.

724
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:57,247
Meaning?

725
00:54:58,356 --> 00:55:01,587
Basically, you wanted to hear from someone else
that you shouldn't get married

726
00:55:01,793 --> 00:55:04,496
And besides us,
who would've told you this.

727
00:55:04,496 --> 00:55:06,364
Have you totally lost it?

728
00:55:06,364 --> 00:55:09,026
The invites are printed.
This isn't the time to overreact!

729
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:10,968
Kabir.

730
00:55:12,504 --> 00:55:14,165
We know Natasha is a great girl.

731
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:16,407
And we know you like her.

732
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:18,431
And of course,
you don't want to hurt her.

733
00:55:19,477 --> 00:55:22,446
But ask yourself...
Do you really want to marry her?

734
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:24,842
And if not, be honest.

735
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:26,406
To yourself and to her.

736
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:30,019
Of course, she'll be hurt.
But in the long run its best for both of you.

737
00:55:30,188 --> 00:55:31,815
He is absolutely right, Kabir.

738
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:33,887
But I've made a commitment.

739
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:35,994
Okay, you screwed up.

740
00:55:35,994 --> 00:55:38,019
No one's going to send you to prison.

741
00:55:38,096 --> 00:55:40,656
It's not that simple.
Our parents are involved.

742
00:55:40,865 --> 00:55:41,695
Parents?

743
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:43,259
Dude, it's your life.

744
00:55:46,338 --> 00:55:47,669
You won't get it.

745
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,670
Just...

746
00:55:50,342 --> 00:55:52,503
Just let it be, okay?
I'm sorry.

747
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:54,471
Kabir...

748
00:55:58,249 --> 00:55:59,216
What a guy!

749
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:18,493
Laila?

750
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,464
Why're you shouting?

751
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:26,169
Why are you so far?

752
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:41,356
Better?

753
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:43,524
Best.

754
00:56:46,598 --> 00:56:47,326
Ammi?

755
00:56:48,466 --> 00:56:49,933
How are you?

756
00:56:52,837 --> 00:56:54,805
I met Salman.

757
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:04,205
I now know why you and Abu
kept this from me.

758
00:57:07,819 --> 00:57:08,877
I'm sorry, Ammi.

759
00:57:11,823 --> 00:57:12,881
- I love you.

760
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:16,183
I love you too, my boy.

761
00:57:52,497 --> 00:57:55,955
It took a while but

762
00:58:00,872 --> 00:58:05,275
I've now learnt to live

763
00:58:09,747 --> 00:58:13,444
Without the consolation of tears

764
00:58:18,122 --> 00:58:22,786
I've now learnt to live

765
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:49,354
There is someone who brought to mind

766
00:58:49,354 --> 00:58:53,916
How I had gotten left behind

767
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:01,326
Life is like a caravan

768
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:06,426
Why are you lonely, my man

769
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,300
Just know that we are all here

770
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:39,561
The first rocket indicates that
the pen gates have been opened.

771
00:59:39,971 --> 00:59:42,439
Second rocket indicates that
the bulls are coming towards us.

772
00:59:42,774 --> 00:59:44,475
We run at the second rocket.

773
00:59:44,475 --> 00:59:45,339
Second rocket.

774
00:59:46,978 --> 00:59:48,536
Oh San Fermin, please protect us.

775
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:51,812
If I die...

776
00:59:52,183 --> 00:59:53,912
my spirit will come back to haunt you.

777
00:59:54,352 --> 00:59:55,876
Why are you thinking about death?

778
00:59:55,954 --> 00:59:57,922
Think about what you'll do
if you survive.

779
01:00:02,493 --> 01:00:02,982
Listen...

780
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:04,559
a new pact.

781
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,125
An if-l-get out-alive pact.

782
01:00:08,299 --> 01:00:10,859
If I get out alive,
I'll let you read my poetry.

783
01:00:12,036 --> 01:00:13,538
Why just you? I'll just...

784
01:00:13,538 --> 01:00:14,732
get it published.

785
01:00:15,607 --> 01:00:16,574
You write poetry?

786
01:00:16,808 --> 01:00:17,638
Yes.

787
01:00:19,444 --> 01:00:20,411
Okay.

788
01:00:20,712 --> 01:00:22,543
If I get out alive...

789
01:00:25,617 --> 01:00:26,311
Okay!

790
01:00:26,784 --> 01:00:28,620
If I get out alive...

791
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,655
I'll go to Morocco with Laila.

792
01:00:30,655 --> 01:00:31,485
Yeah!

793
01:00:31,823 --> 01:00:32,847
That's what I'll do.

794
01:00:33,257 --> 01:00:35,426
What's the worst that could happen?
I'll get fired.

795
01:00:35,426 --> 01:00:36,427
- Right?
- Yeah.

796
01:00:36,427 --> 01:00:37,629
Who cares man?

797
01:00:37,629 --> 01:00:38,823
I'll be with her and I will live.

798
01:00:39,197 --> 01:00:40,357
Well done, my bro!

799
01:00:41,366 --> 01:00:42,196
Come on, Kabir.

800
01:00:44,602 --> 01:00:45,269
Okay.

801
01:00:45,269 --> 01:00:46,964
If I get out alive...

802
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:52,667
Shit guys!
The gates are open!

803
01:00:53,011 --> 01:00:54,069
Kabir just say it.

804
01:00:54,145 --> 01:00:55,840
It's okay, just say it.

805
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:05,957
If I get out alive,
I'll go to London...

806
01:01:05,957 --> 01:01:07,686
and tell Natasha that...

807
01:01:17,502 --> 01:01:18,901
Say what?
Just say it!

808
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:20,398
Come on, Kabir!

809
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,275
- Come on, Kabir!
- Come on!

810
01:01:26,344 --> 01:01:28,938
I'm sorry but I can't marry you.

811
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:31,816
- Congratulations!
- Look out!

812
01:01:31,816 --> 01:01:33,044
- Congratulations!
- Look out!

813
01:04:15,613 --> 01:04:18,316
If you're carrying
your restlessness in your heart

814
01:04:18,316 --> 01:04:20,375
You are alive

815
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:23,011
If you're carrying
the lightning of dreams in your eyes

816
01:04:23,087 --> 01:04:24,281
You are alive

817
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:28,582
Like a gust of wind,
learn to live free

818
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,229
Learn to flow like
the waves that make a sea

819
01:04:32,864 --> 01:04:35,992
Let your arms be wide open,
to every moment you meet

820
01:04:36,701 --> 01:04:40,193
May every moment gift you
a new sight to greet

821
01:04:40,805 --> 01:04:43,205
If you're carrying
your wonder in your eyes

822
01:04:43,274 --> 01:04:45,139
You are alive

823
01:04:45,843 --> 01:04:48,937
If you're carrying
your restlessness in your heart

824
01:04:49,947 --> 01:04:51,073
You are alive

825
01:05:01,492 --> 01:05:01,525
In the arms of the sun now life will be

826
01:05:01,525 --> 01:05:05,363
In the arms of the sun now life will be

827
01:05:05,363 --> 01:05:09,094
With the rays in our breath
And a shine when we speak

828
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:13,068
In the arms of the sun now life will be

829
01:05:13,137 --> 01:05:16,800
With the rays in our breath
And a shine when we speak

830
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:20,778
In the arms of the sun now life will be

831
01:05:20,778 --> 01:05:24,145
With the rays in our breath
And a shine when we speak

832
01:05:32,957 --> 01:05:37,326
Just when the heart
started moving to another beat

833
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:45,091
Out of nowhere
a new thought found its feet

834
01:05:48,172 --> 01:05:52,009
That life gives you just one shot

835
01:05:52,009 --> 01:05:55,680
So why not love it with all you've got

836
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,548
Who knows what we're waiting for

837
01:05:59,617 --> 01:06:03,849
'Cause life is here and life is now

838
01:06:07,525 --> 01:06:12,553
What was only a desire till yesterday

839
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:19,599
Is esactly what we've found today

840
01:06:22,673 --> 01:06:25,665
Hand in hand let's always be

841
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:29,638
As we wander through our destiny

842
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:33,918
And all day and all night

843
01:06:33,918 --> 01:06:38,946
Happiness rains down on
everything in sight

844
01:06:41,158 --> 01:06:45,196
In the arms of the sun now life will be

845
01:06:45,196 --> 01:06:48,927
With the rays in our breath
And a shine when we speak

846
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,837
In the arms of the sun now life will be

847
01:06:52,837 --> 01:06:57,001
With the rays in our breath
And a shine when we speak

848
01:07:12,923 --> 01:07:15,756
If it can knit a new dream everyday

849
01:07:16,761 --> 01:07:19,628
Then you can call it a life

850
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:23,364
If it can lead you down a brand new way

851
01:07:24,435 --> 01:07:27,233
Then you can call it a life

852
01:07:27,972 --> 01:07:30,873
If it can flirt and fly,
If it can spin and jive

853
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:32,408
Then you can call it a life
