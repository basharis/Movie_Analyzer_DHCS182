1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,399
London. The greatest
city in the world.

2
00:00:20,983 --> 00:00:23,357
For 22 years, l've lived here

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,357
Every morning l take a
walk down this street

4
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:29,565
Every morning, the
street asks me my name..

5
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:35,774
Chaudhary Baldev Singh? Who are you?
Where are you from? Why are you here?

6
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,607
Do l have a reply? After
half a lifetime spent here..

7
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:45,607
this land still remains
alien to me; and l to it

8
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:52,815
No one here knows me. None except
these doves. Because they're like me

9
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:58,190
Neither do they belong to a country.
Just drop down where you find food

10
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:00,107
Have your fill, then fly on

11
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:07,190
When shall l fly? l don't know.
Of necessity, my wings are clipped

12
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:14,357
l'm shackled to my bread.
But someday l'll surely go..

13
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:19,065
to my land. To my Punjab

14
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:42,690
"When the koels sing in spring,
it's time again for memories"

15
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:48,232
"lt's time again for
swinging under the boughs"

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:58,232
"Come home o'wanderer,
your heart beCkons"

17
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:03,982
"lt's time again for
swinging under the boughs"

18
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:19,107
"Come home o'wanderer,
your heart beCkons"

19
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,732
Glory to The Goddess

20
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:16,065
Yes Lajjo, l'm here safe and sound.
- Good

21
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:36,482
Why is my little one giggling away?
- Mom! Eνery day for 20 years..

22
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:40,190
Dad has been walking
down the very same street..

23
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:43,024
to his very same destination.
Yet every day, you call him up..

24
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:46,357
just to ask him, "Have you reaChed?"
- You won't understand

25
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:50,565
Just assume it's a habit.
- Habit left unchanged..

26
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:57,649
tends to become neCessity-like.
- Philosophy, again? You're twelve

27
00:04:57,858 --> 00:05:01,482
Talk like a 1 2-year old!
Why all this big talk?

28
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:05,482
There's no childhood, no adulthood.

29
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:10,774
One is as grown-up as one feels

30
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:16,107
All right! l lose! Now go to school,
chew your teacher's brains, okay?

31
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,024
Why d'you forget the
almonds everyday?

32
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:23,357
What to do? Just assume it's habit

33
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,399
Will you get out?

34
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:48,899
"This is the first time
it's happening in 1 8 years"

35
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:51,982
"Some stranger l haνe never seen,
comes to my mind"

36
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,857
That's my diary!
- So what..?

37
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:56,982
Only l can read it.
- That was so funny

38
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:00,399
Let me read some more.
- No way! This is a private diary.

39
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:04,232
Why hide anything from me?
When a girl is grown up..

40
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:07,315
her mother becomes her friend.
Show that to me

41
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,440
You won't tell anyone, will you?
- Never

42
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:16,065
All right. l'll read. You listen.
- Very well

43
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,815
"This is the first time
it's happening in 1 8 years"

44
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:34,899
"Some stranger l haνe
neνer seen, Comes to my mind.."

45
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,565
"shadow-like before my eyes"

46
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:45,149
"Someone raps on my heart"

47
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:50,607
"Deep eyes want me
to give myself up"

48
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:55,732
"When l look at my hands,
there l see a face etched"

49
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,024
"A silken breath brushes my cheeks"

50
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:04,440
"My hair still smells of
the odour on his hands"

51
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:10,232
"Yes, it's happening for
the first time in 1 8 years"

52
00:07:10,816 --> 00:07:14,482
"l've never seen this
stranger who comes to my mind"

53
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:22,940
Simi, you've begun
writing quite well..

54
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,065
..and the boy seems lively.
Who's he?

55
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:29,982
Ma, l've yet to set my eyes on him

56
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:36,607
So there's no one? l was wondering.
One doesn't find such boys nowadays

57
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:41,190
And you dream of someone you
haνen't even seen! Quite mad

58
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,482
No Ma. This is no dream

59
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:52,982
l may not have met him, seen him

60
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:58,357
But he's there. Out there, somewhere

61
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,357
"The one who comes in my dreams.."

62
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:35,399
"the one who teases me.."

63
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,232
"just ask him to face me, onCe"

64
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:40,357
"What's he like? Who is he?
Who knows where is the one.."

65
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,774
"my lips will say yes to?"

66
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:56,232
"ls he someone l know?
ls he a stranger?"

67
00:09:57,066 --> 00:10:00,774
"ls he for real, or just a legend?"

68
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:05,232
"He stares at me, from far, far away"

69
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:09,440
"Tell him not to rob me of my sleep"

70
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,232
"The one who comes in my dreams.."

71
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,232
"the one who teases me.."

72
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:21,982
"just ask him to face me, onCe"

73
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:57,274
"Some kind of spell is overcoming me"

74
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:09,607
"Oh what do l do? My heart yearns so"

75
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:18,024
"My heart tells me it's mad for you.
Then why do you keep hiding from me?"

76
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,232
"He makes me blossom,
it's all his fault"

77
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:26,482
"Tell me, l'm asking for the Moon"

78
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:30,399
"The one who comes in my dreams.."

79
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:34,440
"the one who teases me.."

80
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:47,274
"just ask him to face me, onCe"

81
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:16,232
Raj! This partying all night!
Party all night and you don't sleep

82
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:20,607
And how do you get up in the morning?
Late for graduation! Hurry!

83
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:28,524
ls it a holiday?

84
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,440
What Raj? Late for your graduation?

85
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,357
What to do? Last night..

86
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:44,899
What's wrong with him?
Has he had one too many beers?

87
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:48,565
l hear someone has failed.
The Dean has decided..

88
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,524
..to announCe his name in public

89
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:25,982
You've made Dharam Veer Malhotra stand
an inch and a half taller in his shoes!

90
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:34,315
l don't think you heard it right.
- l knew, someday you'd make me proud!

91
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,774
And not only me, the whole dynasty is
proud of you! Look, they smile at you

92
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:45,440
My great grandfather Diwan
Brijnath never went to school

93
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,649
His son, my grandfather
Diwan Dwarkanath failed..

94
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:53,940
his fourth standard examinations.
My father, your grandfather..

95
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,774
Diwan Pushkarnath, failed his
eighth standard examinations

96
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:58,232
And l, your father,
failed to matriculate

97
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:03,232
Not having an education, failing,
are family traditions. l'm happy that..

98
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:06,857
you have kept tradition alive,
and indeed you're two steps ahead

99
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:10,232
We failed back home in lndia.
You came to London and failed!

100
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:17,190
Are you really happy?
- Glad

101
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:21,399
Education is all useless.
Filling your head with books..

102
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:22,690
..won't fill your pockets

103
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:27,607
Look at me. Runaway peasant-boy from
Bhatinda-turned millionaire in London

104
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,482
So, whatever happens is for the good.
Join my offices from tomorrow

105
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:35,232
Offices? From tomorrow?
- Today, if you wish

106
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:37,815
l can't attend office now.
- Why not?

107
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,690
Pops, you're a man of experience

108
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:45,899
You know what amount of hard work it
takes to fail. And l'm tired, Pops

109
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:49,690
l want a little rest, you know,
like a long European holiday

110
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,732
Long European holiday? How long?
- Month or month and a half

111
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:58,732
Will you hold this
for me? And turn around

112
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:05,607
Moron! Did l bring
you up to see this day?

113
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:18,899
No, don't drop that

114
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:26,649
Are you all right, Pops?

115
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,607
Pops, you're right.
l ought to take care of your business

116
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:40,565
You've become so old.
- You tell your father that?

117
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,774
Pops, l've decided against Europe.
l'm joining the offices from tomorrow

118
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:55,107
ln this house, only your father
deCides. You're going to Europe

119
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:59,107
No. l've had enough of a good time.
My years of youth are over for me

120
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:04,357
Never say your youth is over.

121
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:13,357
All my life l've slogged to
give you whatever l Couldn't do.

122
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,149
When youth came and went,
l never got to know

123
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:26,482
But l wasn't sad, because l knew
that my son will have my years

124
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,899
lf you think you'νe had
enough of a good time..

125
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:35,899
if you think the years of youth
are over for you, well no problem

126
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:41,482
Just go and live my years for me

127
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,440
Ajit's letter?

128
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:17,774
Lajjo! Look, what's here.
Letter! From my friend

129
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:20,732
From Ajit

130
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:23,607
Just smell it, lady!

131
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:28,149
The fragranCe of Punjab!

132
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,940
The flavour of mustard
curry on leavened maize bread

133
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:33,607
Those long tailed shirts,
the short knickers

134
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,149
"My dear friend Baldev,
We're fine here"

135
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:44,982
"We hope to God that you, your
wife and the children are well too"

136
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:48,440
"You will be pleased to hear
that my son has graduated in arts"

137
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:53,274
"He has joined my business.
By God's grace, it's time now..

138
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:56,732
for us to let our childhood
friendship mature into a relationship

139
00:17:56,816 --> 00:18:01,857
Let's make good the promise we made
to each other 20 years ago. l hope..

140
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:06,440
you will come here at the
soonest for Simran's wedding to Kuljit

141
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,690
Read on

142
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,440
She's shy! See Lajjo?

143
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:20,274
That's our etiquette, our culture

144
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:25,982
My daughter is still so shamefaced.
l'm not a failure

145
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:31,024
ln the heart of London,
l've kept lndia alive!

146
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:36,690
Still staring? Lajjo, your daughter's
wedding! Celebrate it with sweets

147
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:38,565
Chutki! l'm so happy today

148
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,857
Can l say one thing?
- Say four things

149
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:47,315
lt'd be better to ask Simran once.
- What are you saying?

150
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:50,565
Ever since she was a baby, she has
known that she is engaged to Kuljit

151
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,607
That she knows. But 20 years..
- Don't you worry!

152
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:58,607
Simran is going to be so happy..

153
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:01,232
..you'll pray that she
neνer gets the evil eye!

154
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:08,190
l'll write to Ajit right away.
God! At last, comes the day

155
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:24,815
Simran, what are you doing?

156
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:31,774
l had forgotten, Ma. l haven't
even the right to dream

157
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:36,482
No my Child, of course you may dream

158
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,482
But don't expect them to come true

159
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:46,065
And who know, Kuljit might
be the man of your dreams

160
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:49,899
l don't care. l've
bought your tickets.

161
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:52,565
You're Coming to Europe with me.
- l can't

162
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:57,357
Babuji won't let me go to
college alone. Will he let me go away..

163
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:58,774
touring Europe for a month.

164
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:02,940
l have lots of work here.
- You've known me for years.

165
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:07,107
Can't you make up an excuse?

166
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:11,232
An excuse, l Can find.
But l don't feel like lying to Babuji

167
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:15,399
You must come. Dolly
and Payal are coming too

168
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,940

For a month?

172
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:39,065
Chutki, Call the doctor. Tell him
that our Simran has gone stark mad

173
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:45,357
Will you at least take a look?
- Check out your brains first

174
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:49,815
You talk of travelling by Eurail?
lf he hears, he'll bring the roof down

175
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:55,357
A lone girl mustn't travel like this.
- Mom, l'm not going to be alone

176
00:20:55,441 --> 00:21:00,149
My friends are going to be with me.
- No good arguing with me

177
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:03,649
l'm not going to object.
But you will need his permission

178
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,857
Ask him when he's home

179
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:11,982
God, please keep Babuji in a nice mood

180
00:21:31,816 --> 00:21:38,232
lt's just beer. lt's over there.
- l told you. The store is shut

181
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,940
Get out

- You won't

185
00:22:02,316 --> 00:22:05,232
Can l have an Aspirin?
- The store is shut

186
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:09,357
My head is about to
crack up! lt's sinusitis

187
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:10,982
lf l Can't find an Aspirin,
l'll faint.

188
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:13,024
All the other stores are shut

189
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:19,107
Please let me have one Aspirin.
One Hindustani ought to help another

190
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:35,232
Glory to The Goddess.
- Here you are

191
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:44,107
l'm feeling bad about forcing you to
open your store for a small medicine

192
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,440
l'd like to buy some
other things from you

193
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:56,732
l'll pick up some beer.
Not for myself.

194
00:22:56,816 --> 00:22:59,607
My friends out there, they drink.

195
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:03,565
Put it down.
- Why sir?

196
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,232
Are you trying to Con me? You aren't
getting anything. Put it down

197
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:10,315
You're getting worked up over
nothing. This is for your profit

198
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,732
Will you put it down?
- Not that umbrella

199
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:21,065
Here you are. A pound extra?
No two. Keep it, okay?

200
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:24,065
Shameless!

201
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,065
You call yourself a Hindustani?
You give lndia a bad name

202
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,815
You're a liar and insolent!
Get out of here

203
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:38,065
l'm off. l'll keep this

204
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:51,024
Rev up!

205
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:20,440
Babuji

206
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:37,982
What is the matter? You're late.
- Bloody shameless scoundrel

207
00:24:38,358 --> 00:24:40,774
They call themselves Hindustani!

208
00:24:40,858 --> 00:24:46,774
Blot on lndia! Ought to drown
themselves Rascals!

209
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:50,440
No shame, no decency.
How to respeCt their elders..

210
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:54,065
they don't even know.
- Have you had a fight?

211
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:59,274
Scum! He came for beer.
l told him the store is shut.

212
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:01,107
He took it perforce

213
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:05,190
He even broke the statue of
The Goddess! Bloody half-caste!

214
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:08,899
l say Lajjo, thank God
that you and your daughters..

215
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:10,649
haven't been marred
by this Britishness!

216
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:14,440
Else, you would've been nowhere!

217
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:17,024
Damn these sCoundrels!

218
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:26,440
Set sail in stormy waters,
and you're in danger of sinking

219
00:26:18,816 --> 00:26:23,065
You were so little when we
brought you here. And now..

220
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:28,649
They said that a grown-up
daughter is a burden on a man

221
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:35,232
But a daughter like you, makes a
father's chest swell with pride!

222
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:39,482
You're my good girl

223
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:49,565
Will you giνe something if l ask you?
- Whatever you wish

224
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:54,357
l want to take a look at Europe

225
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:05,107
Eurail is offering a month's tour.
All my friends are going

226
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:15,899
Please don't be Cross.
l have never disobeyed you, Babuji

227
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:21,440
l'll be going away to a
land l have never seen

228
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,274
The man l'm going to marry
is a complete stranger. But..

229
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,024
l have no Complaints. You must've
considered it in my best interests

230
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:37,607
But l won't get a
chance like this ever again.

231
00:27:39,441 --> 00:27:41,774
l don't eνen know
whether l'll ever come back..

232
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,690
..whether l will have
these friends later on

233
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,482
Besides, it's only for a month.

234
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:52,482
ln a month, l will have
lived a lifetime

235
00:27:55,191 --> 00:28:01,440
For the sake of my happiness, won't
you let me have a month of my life?

236
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:08,482
Please Babuji, give me one month

237
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:24,065
Go. Live it up

238
00:28:28,608 --> 00:28:30,649
My baby

239
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:33,357
Where's Simran?

240
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:37,940
Where might she be?
- Has she slipped in the loo?

241
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,357
l told you to wake up Raj.

242
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:43,940
Did you?
- No

243
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:41,524
Open sesame

244
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,732
Do you have the keys to this?

245
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:55,149
Anybody home?

246
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:00,024
No one at home.

247
00:30:55,858 --> 00:30:59,649
Haven't l seen you somewhere?

248
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,024
At Robbie's party, no?

249
00:31:04,025 --> 00:31:07,899
l don't go to parties.
- Great! Nor do l, ever

250
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:24,857
Your eyes..

251
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:27,982
What's wrong with my eyes?

252
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:32,649
Reminds me of someone.
- Of whom?

253
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:39,940
My grandmother. Like you, her eyes
too had hues of yellows and blues

254
00:31:56,775 --> 00:32:00,482
Keep reading. l only wanted to
find out how you read upside-down

255
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:04,774
This is the limit!

256
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:06,565
Simran, you're here?

257
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:13,399
l heard you've missed the train.
- No, l took it

258
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,857
l was afraid..
- By the way, what's your name?

259
00:32:16,941 --> 00:32:18,107
Sheena

260
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:22,774
Here l am. Shall we?
- Take it easy

261
00:32:37,983 --> 00:32:40,190
Pump it up
- lt's pumped. Look

262
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:42,232
lt's nothing.
- Raj, where have you been?

263
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:44,690
As usual. Caught up with a girl

264
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:48,315
Girl?
- l help her onto the train

265
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,524
And she falls for me.
- What?

266
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:55,065
He bored me. He had me all alone,
and he began flirting

267
00:32:55,358 --> 00:32:58,190
Same old hat..
haνen't l seen you before?

268
00:32:58,233 --> 00:33:00,440
She sidled up to me.
- What?

269
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:04,607
l was scared! Only so much space,
and there she was with me

270
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:08,024
Then?
- Then what? She was lost in my eyes

271
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:14,482
He was after my eyes.
Wouldn't shut up. Boys these days..

272
00:33:14,566 --> 00:33:18,274
These girls! l just managed
to Come out unscathed

273
00:33:18,358 --> 00:33:21,107
What's that?
- lnvitation to a party

274
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:54,690
l told you. lt'll be a bore.
- You prophesied a train crash

275
00:33:54,775 --> 00:33:58,107
And then we'd all be charred alive
after supper in a dinner-hall fire

276
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:01,732
Look, boys.
- Where?

277
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,690
He's the one

278
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:10,440
Where have we landed?
Was this your idea?

279
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:17,815
Us? Or the waiters?

280
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,565
For me. Rocky shut your trap

281
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:25,399
Why did you have to call him?

282
00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:43,315
You know Sheena,
haνen't l seen you before?

283
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:48,024
Me? Really? Where?
- At Robbie's party?

284
00:34:48,108 --> 00:34:52,524
You might've. l go to so many parties

285
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:57,774
You know Sheena..
- What?

286
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:03,982
Your eyes remind me of someone.
- My eyes? Really? Whom?

287
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:05,899
My grandmother

288
00:35:12,566 --> 00:35:18,190
ls she singing or crying?
And l can play better piano

289
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:20,315
You know how to play the piano?

290
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:27,399
l was born on a piano. Been playing
the piano ever since l was a baby

291
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:33,940
You know, l have magic in my fingers.
No sooner than l touch the piano..

292
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:36,315
it starts playing

293
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:47,982
lsn't that voice familiar?

294
00:36:17,858 --> 00:36:20,357
Was this necessary?

295
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:27,482
Doesn't the magic in your fingers
make pianos start playing?

296
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:22,524
"Stop, my wild lover"

297
00:39:22,816 --> 00:39:25,732
"l've got to ask you something"

298
00:39:27,275 --> 00:39:31,232

00:39:54,441 --> 00:39:59,024
"Come, let me touch you"

301
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:03,232

"l'm waiting for you,
holding my heart"

305
00:40:50,858 --> 00:40:54,065
"She looks subdued"

306
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:59,482
"But she has lots to say"

307
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:04,357
"lf you say yes,
l have something to say"

308
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:08,649

"What are you, fragrance or poison?"

"You aren't the only
pretty woman around"

313
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:56,274
"Why are you the
only one who's Cross?"

314
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:05,190
"The one l've fallen for,
is someone else"

315
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,940
"lf she says yes,
l'll take her in my arms"

316
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:14,149
"Wait, my wild love"

317
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,065

"What are you, fragrance or poison?"

320
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:32,732
"Come, let me touch you"

321
00:43:24,775 --> 00:43:27,357
About last night, l'm ashamed

323
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:02,232

First come, first served

327
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:38,190
Hurry! The train is about to leave.
- Where did l keep my money?

328
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,982
One minute, l don't know how to count
this currency.. lots of small change

329
00:44:47,775 --> 00:44:51,190
Can you tell me one, two's, eighths?

Train's gone?

332
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,940
The train is gone!

333
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:20,357
Don't cry, Senorita

334
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,899
But you just stopped crying

335
00:45:29,233 --> 00:45:33,524
lt's raining! Don't Cry,
please! l'm with you, l'm here! Look

336
00:45:35,025 --> 00:45:41,065
Okay, l'm gone..
gone! Here's your bell

337
00:45:59,316 --> 00:46:02,232
The next train is very late.
To catch up with the train..

338
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:07,274
at Zurich tomorrow morning,
we can either take a bus or hire a Car

339
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:10,690
What would be your pleasure?
Bus or car? Where's she?

340
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,024
Ever since you met me,
you've been harassing me

341
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,399
What are you saying?
- All along the trip..

342
00:46:19,483 --> 00:46:21,440
you've been chewing my brains.
- l?

343
00:46:21,525 --> 00:46:25,232
Something's always the problem with
you. Today, l've missed the train..

344
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:26,940
thanks to you.
- To me?

345
00:46:27,025 --> 00:46:32,399
l wish to make it to Zurich on time.
So you go your way, l'll go mine

346
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:37,982
Strange! We're fellow-travellers,
on the same destination, same train

347
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:43,690
Why split up? Besides, a man like me
ought to stay with a girl like you

348
00:46:43,775 --> 00:46:51,232
Wrong! A girl like me doesn't need
a guy like you. Stop pursuing me

349
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,732
l'll sew it up. l have a thread
and needle. l'll buy you a new dress

350
00:48:48,108 --> 00:48:49,899
What have you got yourself into?

351
00:48:49,983 --> 00:48:52,732
l told you not to pursue me!
Who do you think you are?

352
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:58,607
What do you think of yourself?
l wasn't pursuing you

353
00:48:58,691 --> 00:48:59,774
And l don't fancy touching you.

354
00:48:59,858 --> 00:49:02,107
Thank your stars l came
in the nick of time

355
00:49:02,191 --> 00:49:05,399
Else, you would've been in jail.
l help her, and she says this

356
00:49:05,483 --> 00:49:07,815
Hey, take her away

357
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:56,482
What did you say?

358
00:50:00,108 --> 00:50:01,774
l got carried away

359
00:50:03,691 --> 00:50:05,524
Never mind Senorita, never mind.

360
00:50:05,608 --> 00:50:08,524
ln big places,
such small things happen

361
00:50:09,733 --> 00:50:16,024
What's about this Senorita?
- My first girl friend was from Spain

362
00:50:18,025 --> 00:50:23,690
Why did you dump her?
- She hated lndians

363
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:31,815
You like lndians, don't you?
- When do we reach Zurich?

364
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,315
What's in Zurich?
This is the real Europe

365
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:42,524
So beautiful, so pretty. Sometimes,
l fear, it might become dirty

366
00:50:44,025 --> 00:50:46,649
Here for the first time?
- Yes

367
00:50:46,733 --> 00:50:50,274
Will you drive faster?
- What's the hurry Senorita?

368
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:54,857
Train leaves Zurich at 1 1 :30 tomorrow.
We haνe a whole night and half a day

369
00:50:54,941 --> 00:50:56,940
We'll be there on time.
- Still, if we could..

370
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:02,024
What had to happen, has happened.
Now you're with me

371
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:04,107
Nothing can go wrong

372
00:51:17,983 --> 00:51:21,607
Europe is best done on foot

373
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:35,065
Just the four of us.
Chutki is way ahead of her years

374
00:51:36,191 --> 00:51:42,065
And Ma's more a friend than a mother.
So l never felt the need for a friend

375
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:49,607
You can't live the rest of your life
with friends. Sometime or the other..

376
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:54,607
you will need someone who
will walk by you all your life

377
00:51:57,441 --> 00:52:01,065
Can't walk anymore. l'm tired.
- Do l pick you up in my arms?

378
00:52:01,525 --> 00:52:07,690
l can't afford a hotel. Let's try
that house. We might find lodgings

379
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,649
Come. Arrangements
for the night is done

380
00:52:27,733 --> 00:52:29,440
Which is your room?

381
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:36,315
Situation is somewhat like this.
There's only one room

382
00:52:38,233 --> 00:52:42,232
And we spend the night in the same
room? You presume somewhat like that?

383
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:46,107
How compelling!
- Not quite so compelling

384
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:50,690
l'm not staying here one minute.
- You take the bed. l'll take the sofa

385
00:52:50,775 --> 00:52:52,857
No problems.
- No way. l'm leaving

386
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,982
l'm not joking. l'm going away.
- And l'll have the bed all to myself?

387
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:49,899
So nice.. so romantic!

388
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:55,399
And these curtains.. so nice!

389
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,732
And the view!

390
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:01,774
No horses?

391
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:05,690
lt's so warm in here

392
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,732
You have a fire going

393
00:54:11,566 --> 00:54:16,232
Granted. You have a
great sense of choice

394
00:54:17,483 --> 00:54:23,065
You couldn't find a better
place to spend the night, right?

395
00:54:27,108 --> 00:54:28,940
We were getting a nice room

396
00:54:29,316 --> 00:54:34,149
But you'd rather spend the night with
me in the stables. Not in the room

397
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:41,815
Eat
- l'm not hungry

398
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:48,274
All right. Don't eat.
How am l bothered?

399
00:55:24,566 --> 00:55:26,899
Eat it

400
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,815
l told you. l'm not hungry.

401
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:32,690
Come on now. Eat

402
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:40,107
What did you say?

403
00:55:45,566 --> 00:55:48,024
l got carried away

404
00:55:50,608 --> 00:55:56,232
Never mind. ln big places,
such small things happen

405
00:55:58,066 --> 00:56:02,107
You were right, Senorita.
The spirit of adventure in this barn..

406
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:06,274
you could never enjoy in that room.
- But how do we get to Zurich?

407
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:11,815
No, not Zurich. Tomorrow evening,
we entrain at Berne. Tomorrow morning..

408
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,065
we take the first bus at eight.
l've found out everything

409
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:21,274
Now, nothing can go wrong

410
00:56:49,108 --> 00:56:51,274
What's that?
- Life

411
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:58,232
Aren't you ashamed to drink
in the presence of a lady?

412
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:02,149
Better than dying before the lady!
lf you wish to live on..

413
00:57:02,233 --> 00:57:06,149
you too should have a bit, Senorita.
- Don't you dare come near me

414
00:57:06,316 --> 00:57:08,607
All right, don't

415
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:25,482
l'll see you tomorrow
morning if you're still alive.

416
00:57:25,816 --> 00:57:27,982
Until then, goodnight

417
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:27,649
"May l have a jig?
- Oh no!"

418
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:31,315
"May l try a pirouette?
- Oh no!"

419
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,690
"How about a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

420
00:58:34,775 --> 00:58:41,524
"Let me fly with the wind"

421
00:58:41,858 --> 00:58:48,274
"God! Help me"

422
00:59:45,025 --> 00:59:51,815
"The chill in the
breeze sets my body afire"

423
00:59:52,358 --> 00:59:56,149
"l feel like.."

424
00:59:56,275 --> 00:59:59,232
"making love to you"

425
00:59:59,525 --> 01:00:02,982
"This never happened before"

426
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:06,524
"l've taken my first step"

427
01:00:06,608 --> 01:00:13,107
"Let me fly with the wind"

428
01:00:13,691 --> 01:00:20,899
"God! Help me"

429
01:00:21,525 --> 01:00:25,149
"May l have a jig?
- Oh no!"

430
01:00:25,233 --> 01:00:28,857
"May l try a pirouette?"
- Oh no!"

431
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:32,899
"Give me a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

432
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:05,232
"Where do you think you're going,
my darling, my love?"

433
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:12,857
"You're a pretty girl.
l'm a handsome young man"

434
01:01:12,941 --> 01:01:16,815
"Come into my embraCe"

435
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:20,024
"Let me hold you in my eyes"

436
01:01:20,108 --> 01:01:27,024
"Oh, l'm drunk"

437
01:01:27,233 --> 01:01:33,899
"God! Help me"

438
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:38,440
"May l have a jig?
- Oh no!"

439
01:01:38,525 --> 01:01:42,232
"May l try a pirouette?"
- Oh no!"

440
01:01:42,316 --> 01:01:45,732
"Give me a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

441
01:01:45,816 --> 01:01:52,649
"Oh, l'm ecstatic"

442
01:01:52,858 --> 01:01:59,732
"God! Help me"

443
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:59,857
Up in the mornings,
you look even prettier

444
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,065
How did l get here?

445
01:03:13,233 --> 01:03:16,649
With me. Last night

446
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,440
l don't think you've
ever had a drink before

447
01:03:22,191 --> 01:03:23,899
And you had one too many

448
01:03:25,441 --> 01:03:26,649
Have this

449
01:03:28,775 --> 01:03:30,607
What happened last night?

450
01:03:33,316 --> 01:03:40,274
What happened last night,
was bound to happen

451
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:47,024
But l didn't imagine
it'd happen this way

452
01:03:47,775 --> 01:03:51,190
Tell me the truth, Raj!
What happened last night?

453
01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:54,190
How do l answer this question, Simran?

454
01:03:55,441 --> 01:04:02,357
Look, look into my eyes.
Aren't my eyes telling the truth?

455
01:04:04,483 --> 01:04:07,815
No! This could never have happened

456
01:04:09,566 --> 01:04:14,024
This could never have happened.
- That's exactly what happened, Simran

457
01:04:16,275 --> 01:04:19,232
Who can stop what is to happen?

458
01:04:19,608 --> 01:04:22,399
You're lying! You're lying,
aren't you?

459
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:25,607
No Simran.
- Please tell me you're lying

460
01:04:26,525 --> 01:04:31,690
Please! - Granted! l'm lying,
my eyes are lying

461
01:04:32,816 --> 01:04:35,274
But are these love-bites lying?

462
01:04:37,191 --> 01:04:38,357
Speak

463
01:04:38,816 --> 01:04:41,440
Tell me Simran! Are these yours?
Or someone else's?

464
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:46,232
Don't cry! l was just joking

465
01:04:46,275 --> 01:04:50,149
Those aren't real!
Look! l used your lipstick

466
01:04:52,233 --> 01:04:55,899
You only had one too many,
and you were dripping wet

467
01:04:55,983 --> 01:04:59,565
l had no options. l had to bring
you here. l swear, l'm just joking

468
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:01,274
You were all alone on the bed.
l slept out there.

469
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:03,232
l'm just joking! l swear

470
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:06,982
Don't cry, don't.

471
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:20,190
l know what you think of me.
You think l'm a wastrel

472
01:05:21,858 --> 01:05:28,107
l'm not scum, Simran.
l'm Hindustani

473
01:05:29,233 --> 01:05:32,649
And l know what honour
means for the Hindustani woman

474
01:05:34,066 --> 01:05:40,107
Not even in my dreams can l imagine
doing that to you. Trust me, Simran

475
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:48,149
l'm saying the truth. Last night,
nothing happened. Just a joke

476
01:05:58,691 --> 01:06:02,774
Please, never joke about that.
You don't know what l would've done

477
01:06:03,233 --> 01:06:04,690
Please, no jokes like that

478
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:10,607
l promise never to
crack a joke like that

479
01:06:34,441 --> 01:06:37,857
Get changed. Fast.
We got to catCh the bus

480
01:06:38,525 --> 01:06:41,024
May l have my shirt back?

481
01:06:59,233 --> 01:07:02,482
Fifteen minutes before the bus
leaves. You want to eat something?

482
01:07:04,316 --> 01:07:06,940
No, l'm not hungry.

483
01:07:13,191 --> 01:07:15,690
Come on, let's take a look inside.
- Churches aren't worth a look

484
01:07:15,775 --> 01:07:16,899
l'm not going.

485
01:07:23,275 --> 01:07:25,232
Go on. Take a look

486
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:07,774
What?
- Hurry up. We'll miss the bus

487
01:08:42,983 --> 01:08:47,524
Shall we?
- Why not leave after tea?

488
01:08:52,108 --> 01:08:56,607
What did you ask for?
- You aren't supposed to speak of it

489
01:08:57,858 --> 01:09:00,524
Then you must be sure about
being given what you've asked for

490
01:09:01,525 --> 01:09:06,232
Whatever one seeks with a
pure heart, one is surely given

491
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:11,065
Go on. l'll be back in a minute.
- What happened?

492
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:13,274
Go on. l'll join you

493
01:09:25,316 --> 01:09:28,190
l'm Raj

494
01:09:29,191 --> 01:09:33,482
l'm sorry, l don't know how to pray.
But l want nothing for myself

495
01:09:36,483 --> 01:09:42,982
But that girl Simran,
she's nice. Very good at heart

496
01:09:43,733 --> 01:09:46,482
Give her whatever she asked for

497
01:10:01,358 --> 01:10:02,857
Where have you been?

498
01:10:05,775 --> 01:10:07,357
ln the church?

499
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,524
Half a teaspoon of sugar, one spoon
of milk, bit of Cream. Your coffee

500
01:10:24,858 --> 01:10:28,149
You want a postcard to send home?
- Postcard? For home?

501
01:10:28,233 --> 01:10:31,857
lf that postcard reaches home,
my Pop will give me up for dead

502
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:35,399
When were you last serious?
- Till now, neνer

503
01:10:35,483 --> 01:10:38,857
lf ever, it'll happen only once.
- When?

504
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:41,899
When l'm in loνe

505
01:10:43,108 --> 01:10:46,940
A boy like you was never in love?
- l've had many affairs

506
01:10:47,108 --> 01:10:51,274
But l was never in love, Senorita.
Never found one

507
01:10:51,858 --> 01:10:53,607
What kind of girl
are you looking for?

508
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,607
Want me to tell you?

509
01:10:58,066 --> 01:11:00,482
The moment l look at her..

510
01:11:00,566 --> 01:11:05,482
all my heart's desires,
all my dreams will come alive

511
01:11:07,191 --> 01:11:16,232
Has never happened. But now l hear
a voiCe, behind the clouds, calling

512
01:11:17,316 --> 01:11:22,815
She's a stranger, a face l've never
seen before. When will the clouds part?

513
01:11:27,108 --> 01:11:31,107
Has it never happened with you?
- No

514
01:11:31,775 --> 01:11:35,899
No stranger ever invaded your dreams?

515
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:39,899
No place for strangers in my dreams

516
01:11:42,816 --> 01:11:44,815
l am engaged to marry

517
01:11:50,233 --> 01:11:53,399
Engaged to marry?
- Yes

518
01:11:55,066 --> 01:11:58,357
Where's the fiance? ln London?
- No, in lndia

519
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:00,440
Looks?

520
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:04,690
Don't know. Never seen him

521
01:12:06,816 --> 01:12:11,107
You've never seen the
man you're going to marry?

522
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:16,982
Not necessary. My father has
seen him. His friend's son

523
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:26,065
You'll spend your life
with someone you've never met?

524
01:12:27,025 --> 01:12:29,857
A complete stranger?

525
01:12:31,275 --> 01:12:38,107
That's how it happens with us.
- And you're happy with this decision?

526
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:51,232
The train is here

527
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:42,607
Lovely photographs. Send me a set of
copies. And your wedding photos too

528
01:13:42,816 --> 01:13:46,649
Won't you be there at my wedding?
- Who's going to travel so far?

529
01:13:46,733 --> 01:13:51,357
Sheena, you must!
- Just joking. Of course, l'll come

530
01:13:51,441 --> 01:13:56,732
l got to take a look at your groom.
Who knows what idiot she's marrying?

531
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,149
You dropped this

532
01:14:41,275 --> 01:14:43,940
What happened? Why are
you staring like that?

533
01:14:44,941 --> 01:14:48,274
l have something to tell you Simran

534
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:50,565
Go on

535
01:14:52,525 --> 01:14:54,940
l'm in love with you

536
01:15:14,233 --> 01:15:16,482
Just look at your face

537
01:15:18,733 --> 01:15:20,899
You thought l was saying the truth?

538
01:15:22,608 --> 01:15:26,065
Strange Simran! You've
known me for so long..

539
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:32,149
and you still can't make me out?
Remember? l've never been serious

540
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:41,024
All this love etc. is beyond me.
Still haven't been able to make out..

541
01:15:41,108 --> 01:15:45,274
how some men spend a lifetime
with one girl!

542
01:15:45,358 --> 01:15:47,274
lt's a world full of pretty women

543
01:15:47,691 --> 01:15:52,232
Someone has beautiful eyes, someone
has good lips, someone has niCe hair..

544
01:15:52,275 --> 01:15:58,565
You boys are all the same.
- But you're one up on all of us

545
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:07,565
You're about to spend a lifetime
with someone you haven't even seen

546
01:16:08,983 --> 01:16:12,732
That must be true love

547
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:24,440
Forget it. Think for a moment,
what if you're in love with someone?

548
01:16:24,608 --> 01:16:28,649
l mean, imagine you're in love
with someone you've met on this trip..

549
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:34,232
why someone? Say you're in love
with me, and l'm in love with you too

550
01:16:37,525 --> 01:16:44,357
Then what will you do? Will you
go back to marry that stranger?

551
01:16:45,691 --> 01:16:49,774
Or, will you have the
courage to have an affair with me?

552
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,524
What will you do?

553
01:17:04,108 --> 01:17:09,274
l don't want to miss the train again.
- l want to miss it again and again

554
01:17:10,108 --> 01:17:13,482
What?
- Nothing

555
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:22,774
lf she's in love with me,
she's going to turn around

556
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:35,815
Turn

557
01:18:25,441 --> 01:18:30,190
Back in London. How a month
passed by, l didn't even notice

558
01:18:56,025 --> 01:19:01,940
Raj, you haven't given me your address.
l'll send you my wedding invitation

559
01:19:02,025 --> 01:19:03,482
You'll come, won't you?

560
01:19:06,025 --> 01:19:08,524
No, l won't come

561
01:19:36,233 --> 01:19:43,399
"What's come over.."

562
01:19:44,108 --> 01:19:47,482
"my heart?"

563
01:19:48,233 --> 01:19:57,440
"Have l lost it?"

564
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:05,357
"What's come over my heart?"

565
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:12,857
"Where have l lost it?"

566
01:20:27,983 --> 01:20:32,232
"You're in love, my love"

567
01:20:32,775 --> 01:20:37,065
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

568
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:42,149
"You're in love, my love"

569
01:20:42,358 --> 01:20:46,815
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

570
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:51,690
"Darling, this is love"

571
01:21:01,525 --> 01:21:05,815
"You're in love, my love"

572
01:21:06,275 --> 01:21:10,690
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

573
01:21:10,775 --> 01:21:15,774
"Darling, this is love"

574
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:44,857
"You didn't Care to turn around.."

575
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:49,107
"but l was still waiting"

576
01:21:49,733 --> 01:21:54,399
"By the time l wanted to stop you.."

577
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:58,232
"..you were too far away"

578
01:21:58,733 --> 01:22:03,232
"What happened?"
- "l don't even know"

579
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:07,815
"Why is my heart.."
- "ln love?"

580
01:22:08,566 --> 01:22:12,857
"You're in love, my love"

581
01:22:13,358 --> 01:22:17,607
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

582
01:22:18,191 --> 01:22:22,690
"You're in love, my love"

583
01:22:23,025 --> 01:22:27,315
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

584
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:32,482
"Darling, this is love"

585
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:10,649
"Oh time! Stop, tarry.."

586
01:23:10,941 --> 01:23:14,857
"go backwards"

587
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:20,399
"l've left myself behind.."

588
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:24,399
"..at the Crossroads of life"

589
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:29,274
"Where am l?"
- "Where are you?"

590
01:23:29,441 --> 01:23:33,940
"What is this?"
- "Magic"

591
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:38,815
"You're in love, my love"

592
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:43,774
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

593
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:48,607
"You're in love, my love"

594
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:53,274
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

595
01:23:53,358 --> 01:23:58,440
"Darling, this is love"

596
01:24:33,608 --> 01:24:39,607
"What's come over.."

597
01:24:40,525 --> 01:24:44,065
"my heart?"

598
01:24:44,816 --> 01:24:51,024
"My heart was with me always"

599
01:24:51,566 --> 01:24:54,190
"Have l lost it?"

600
01:24:55,066 --> 01:24:58,607
"l've lost it"

601
01:25:15,983 --> 01:25:19,190
Ma, you remember the dream
l wrote about in my diary?

602
01:25:20,525 --> 01:25:24,024
That face l imagined
holding in my hands?

603
01:25:25,233 --> 01:25:28,149
The one, l wanted to face

604
01:25:28,983 --> 01:25:31,940
l've found him

605
01:25:32,566 --> 01:25:33,815
What?

606
01:25:35,316 --> 01:25:39,940
What are you saying, Simi?
- Yes Ma. When l was leaving..

607
01:25:40,108 --> 01:25:42,899
l was clear about what
l was getting out of life

608
01:25:43,316 --> 01:25:48,607
For a month, l wanted to be as
happy as l could. Then l'd come back..

609
01:25:48,816 --> 01:25:53,649
and go away to my country to
spend a lifetime with a stranger

610
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:59,565
l had come to a Compromise with my
destiny, Ma. But little did l know..

611
01:26:00,108 --> 01:26:04,940
this was in store for me.
Like a storm he came..

612
01:26:05,483 --> 01:26:08,565
and he swept me off like a fallen leaf

613
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:16,190
Love's like this, like that,
l had read, l had heard

614
01:26:16,441 --> 01:26:20,899
But l never understood. When, for the
first time, he offered me his hand..

615
01:26:27,233 --> 01:26:30,982
l still didn't understand.
l was with him for so long..

616
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:37,232
still l didn't understand anything.
But today, when we were parting..

617
01:26:38,233 --> 01:26:42,357
for the first time l felt
that after this moment..

618
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:47,232
l'm not going to see him ever again.
l kept looking back. He was going away

619
01:26:47,816 --> 01:26:53,274
l wanted to stop him, l wanted to say
something, l wanted to hear something

620
01:26:54,900 --> 01:27:00,732
But he didn't stop. Then l understood.
This is what love is like

621
01:27:01,733 --> 01:27:09,024
And to him, l've given all my dreams.
l don't even know whether he loves me

622
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:16,607
All l know is that for me, he's life.
l can never be anyone else's, Ma

623
01:27:33,483 --> 01:27:36,607
You're up? Simi and
l have been talking

624
01:27:36,858 --> 01:27:40,524
She's back after so long.
l even lost track of time

625
01:27:56,650 --> 01:28:01,690
l told you, not to betray my trust

626
01:28:03,983 --> 01:28:09,399
l took a promise from you.
And you've deceived me?

627
01:28:09,775 --> 01:28:12,232
No Babuji..
- Listen, first ask her

628
01:28:12,275 --> 01:28:14,149
l don't want to listen to anything!

629
01:28:16,608 --> 01:28:21,274
Pack. Tomorrow morning,
we leave for lndia

630
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,274
For good

631
01:28:30,691 --> 01:28:32,274
Let her Cry

632
01:28:33,233 --> 01:28:36,024
She has writ it on her own destiny

633
01:28:37,108 --> 01:28:41,440
She will have to learn for herself
how to get over it. Let her cry

634
01:29:18,441 --> 01:29:20,857
What's her name?
- Simran

635
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,732
What girl, Pops?

636
01:29:26,191 --> 01:29:28,690
The one whose face
you see in the moon.

637
01:29:31,275 --> 01:29:32,357
l'm not one of them..

638
01:29:32,441 --> 01:29:35,399
who will go Crazy about a girl.
- Yes, l forgot!

639
01:29:35,483 --> 01:29:37,774
Some have good lips,
some have beautiful eyes..

640
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:44,440
Lives where?
- Who, Pops?

641
01:29:45,941 --> 01:29:47,482
This.. Simran

642
01:29:53,233 --> 01:29:57,524
Don't know
- How is she?

643
01:29:58,525 --> 01:29:59,982
Very lovable

644
01:30:02,233 --> 01:30:03,607
Then what's the problem?

645
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:11,774
Problem is, she's about to marry.
- How about stopping the wedding?

646
01:30:13,108 --> 01:30:16,815
ln your times, it was different.
Times have changed

647
01:30:18,525 --> 01:30:23,482
Love is still called "love". That has
neνer changed, nor will it ever change

648
01:30:26,525 --> 01:30:30,399
She's going to be someone else's.
- The bride goes to the man..

649
01:30:30,483 --> 01:30:35,857
who brings her home. l didn't sire
you to play that fiddle. We aren't

650
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,732
those who stare at the moon.
You reaCh out to the moon..

651
01:30:38,816 --> 01:30:41,357
..you bring her home. Go

652
01:30:42,025 --> 01:30:45,649
And come home only
with your bride. Get it?

653
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:32,024
Gone. The daughter is getting married.

654
01:31:32,108 --> 01:31:34,232
They've sold out and moved to Punjab

655
01:32:02,983 --> 01:32:04,399
l'm coming, Simran

656
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:08,232
l'm coming

657
01:33:08,525 --> 01:33:13,857
"When the girls go to the riverbank,
you'll hear their anklets chime"

658
01:33:14,191 --> 01:33:16,732
"When the ripe mustard
sways in the farms.."

659
01:33:16,816 --> 01:33:20,399
"you'll know a year has come to pass"

660
01:33:21,358 --> 01:33:26,774
"Come today, come with a smile,
bring me a song, l've been waiting.."

661
01:33:26,858 --> 01:33:32,232
"for the whistle of
the chugging train"

662
01:33:32,316 --> 01:33:37,565
"Come home o'wanderer,
your mate beckons"

663
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:41,357
"Come home o'wanderer"

664
01:33:43,566 --> 01:33:48,232
"Your land beckons"

665
01:34:07,233 --> 01:34:08,899
Bless me, Ma-ji

666
01:34:18,691 --> 01:34:21,232
No Ma-ji

667
01:34:23,816 --> 01:34:31,357
Son, 20 years
l've held back these tears

668
01:34:35,108 --> 01:34:40,232
Today, they won't stop, son.
Not today

669
01:34:46,275 --> 01:34:48,190
Simran, my child

670
01:34:48,816 --> 01:34:51,649
My baby doll

671
01:34:52,525 --> 01:34:58,190
How have you been?
- l haven't Changed a bit!

672
01:34:58,775 --> 01:35:03,232
You're the bride's aunt now!
Time to find a good groom for yourself

673
01:35:03,316 --> 01:35:06,190
Lajjo, l've been ready all
these years! But in this village..

674
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:08,857
there isn't one who's a
match for me. So what do l do?

675
01:35:09,066 --> 01:35:12,190
For me, l think it'll
haνe to be a foreigner!

676
01:35:12,233 --> 01:35:15,774
You haven't changed a bit.
- Not a bit!

677
01:35:16,941 --> 01:35:21,357
You did keep us waiting.
Anyway, better late than never

678
01:35:21,441 --> 01:35:25,024
Wife, will you excuse us a moment?
- Get lost

679
01:35:26,525 --> 01:35:32,107
Come on. Baldev, who's this? Go on..

680
01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:35,982
You don't know? My daughter Preeti

681
01:35:36,066 --> 01:35:40,232
Kuljit's sister.
- May you live long

682
01:35:41,191 --> 01:35:45,357
Wonderful, isn't it? ln 20 years,
the whole generation has come of age

683
01:35:45,441 --> 01:35:47,274
She's beautiful.
- Father's daughter, right?

684
01:35:47,358 --> 01:35:48,982
Get lost

685
01:35:49,525 --> 01:35:51,524
Where's Kuljit?
- Yes, where's Kuljit?

686
01:35:51,608 --> 01:35:54,774
Bhaiyya (Brother) is out for a hunt.
He should be back soon

687
01:36:18,483 --> 01:36:23,482
My respects.
- May you live long, son

688
01:36:25,025 --> 01:36:29,232
That's a strong lad from Punjab.
- Whose son is he anyway?

689
01:36:29,316 --> 01:36:30,732
Get lost

690
01:36:30,816 --> 01:36:33,940
Come, breakfast is ready.
- Yes hurry. l'm famished

691
01:36:34,025 --> 01:36:36,357
Come on kids

692
01:36:36,441 --> 01:36:41,065
For you, for you and for you

693
01:36:41,233 --> 01:36:43,524
You must take me out
tomorrow morning.

694
01:36:43,608 --> 01:36:45,357
Sure Didi (Sister)

695
01:37:14,775 --> 01:37:17,815
Kids, Grannie wants
everyone downstairs

696
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:44,232
You know Simi, when l was a kid,
my father would tell me..

697
01:37:44,983 --> 01:37:51,982
there's no difference between man
and woman. All have equal rights

698
01:37:53,316 --> 01:37:59,190
All my childhood, l lived believing
it's true. But as l grew up..

699
01:37:59,983 --> 01:38:02,940
l realised what a lie that is

700
01:38:04,816 --> 01:38:07,565
l wasn't given an education,
beCause it was more important..

701
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:13,024
that my brothers be eduCated.
That was my first sacrifice

702
01:38:14,566 --> 01:38:19,190
Then, at every step, sometimes
as daughter, sometimes as sister..

703
01:38:19,525 --> 01:38:22,565
sometimes as wife..
l went on sacrificing my own happiness

704
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:27,190
But once you were born..

705
01:38:27,858 --> 01:38:31,149
when l held you in my
hands for the first time..

706
01:38:32,358 --> 01:38:40,690
l made a promise, never to let happen
to my daughter, what happened to me

707
01:38:42,025 --> 01:38:47,565
No more saCrifices at every step
as daughter, as sister, as wife

708
01:38:48,316 --> 01:38:53,190
So what if she's a girl?
She'd liνe her life as she wishes

709
01:38:53,608 --> 01:38:59,357
She'd have her share of happiness.
But l was wrong, Simran

710
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:04,940
l had even forgotten that a woman
hasn't even the right to make promises

711
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:12,232
She is born to be sacrificed
for their men. For their women..

712
01:39:12,275 --> 01:39:16,565
men will never make sacrifices,
nor will they ever make sacrifices

713
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:23,857
Therefore l, your mother, come to
take from you, your own happiness

714
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:28,440
Forget him, my Child. Forget.

715
01:39:28,525 --> 01:39:33,815
Because your father
won't care for your tears

716
01:39:35,525 --> 01:39:40,149
For the happinesses of everyone,
l beg of you

717
01:39:42,191 --> 01:39:45,940
Forget him, my Child

718
01:40:03,108 --> 01:40:04,732
You're right, Ma

719
01:40:06,066 --> 01:40:13,857
So naive of me. l don't
even know whether he loves me

720
01:40:15,650 --> 01:40:21,482
And after all, Babuji is my father.
He has always cared for my happiness

721
01:40:23,816 --> 01:40:28,232
For the sake of his happiness,
can l not make this little sacrifice?

722
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:37,732
Go Ma, go and tell Babuji
that l'm ready for the wedding

723
01:40:39,941 --> 01:40:42,857
He won't have any problems from my end

724
01:41:28,983 --> 01:41:32,815
Your girl is beautiful

725
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:37,190
Not the girl. Kuljit is plain lucky

726
01:41:43,441 --> 01:41:47,982
And my name is Rajeshwari.
Miss Rajeshwari Singh

727
01:41:48,316 --> 01:41:52,857
lf the little one is like this,
what will the older one be like?

728
01:41:53,483 --> 01:41:56,774
l'll tell you, after the wedding

729
01:41:57,983 --> 01:42:00,940
Listen

730
01:42:01,108 --> 01:42:03,107
The day after
tomorrow is the engagement

731
01:42:03,191 --> 01:42:05,315
The wedding is on the 25th

732
01:42:10,275 --> 01:42:12,274
Sweets

733
01:43:00,691 --> 01:43:03,149
l'm worried about something

734
01:43:03,941 --> 01:43:10,607
l don't know why l see
this sadness in Simran's eyes

735
01:43:11,525 --> 01:43:17,274
Even her smile is hesitant.
ls everything all right?

736
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:19,940
lt's nothing, Ma

737
01:43:20,025 --> 01:43:27,399
lt's a new place, it's a change.
ln a few days, she'll adjust

738
01:43:27,483 --> 01:43:29,857
Don't worry for nothing

739
01:43:31,275 --> 01:43:32,982
Here you are, kheer

740
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:41,857
Simran hasn't forgotten him yet?
- She has agreed to get married

741
01:43:42,358 --> 01:43:48,399
By and by she will forget everything.
- lf she remembers, she'll regret it

742
01:44:58,858 --> 01:45:06,857
"l saw you, l realised.."

743
01:45:11,650 --> 01:45:18,482
"what madness love is"

744
01:45:20,066 --> 01:45:27,774
"When l saw you, l realised.."

745
01:46:17,816 --> 01:46:22,357
"what madness love is"

746
01:46:32,816 --> 01:46:37,774
"From here, where to?"

747
01:46:37,858 --> 01:46:42,690
"Just let me die in your arms"

748
01:46:43,233 --> 01:46:47,649
"When l saw you, l realised.."

749
01:46:48,275 --> 01:46:52,899
"what madness love is"

750
01:46:53,233 --> 01:46:58,024
"From here, where to?"

751
01:46:58,525 --> 01:47:03,232
"Just let me die in your arms"

752
01:47:42,191 --> 01:47:44,565
"My eyes.."

753
01:47:44,691 --> 01:47:46,732
"dream of you"

754
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:50,024
"My heart holds memories of you"

755
01:47:52,233 --> 01:47:54,482
"Nothing's mine"

756
01:47:54,733 --> 01:47:56,815
"lt's all yours"

757
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:59,732
"My life, my breath is yours"

758
01:48:01,483 --> 01:48:06,274
"When l weep for you, your tears.."

759
01:48:06,566 --> 01:48:11,232
"my sorrows begin to smile"

760
01:48:11,483 --> 01:48:16,357
"l saw you, l realised.."

761
01:48:16,816 --> 01:48:21,440
"what madness love is"

762
01:48:21,691 --> 01:48:26,232
"From here, where to?"

763
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:31,690
"Just let me die in your arms"

764
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:02,565
"l don't feel like anything"

765
01:49:02,650 --> 01:49:05,524
"What do l say, what do l do?"

766
01:49:07,358 --> 01:49:10,482
"ln front of me.."

767
01:49:10,733 --> 01:49:12,732
"just keep sitting."

768
01:49:12,816 --> 01:49:15,607
"Just let me look at you"

769
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:22,315
"You called out to me,
and look, here l am"

770
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:27,232
"What greater than
the promise to love?"

771
01:49:27,316 --> 01:49:32,107
"l saw you, l realised.."

772
01:49:32,608 --> 01:49:37,065
"what madness love is"

773
01:49:37,525 --> 01:49:41,940
"l saw you, l realised.."

774
01:49:42,650 --> 01:49:47,232
"what madness love is"

775
01:49:47,483 --> 01:49:51,982
"From here, where to?"

776
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:57,149
"Just let me die in your arms"

777
01:50:46,525 --> 01:50:49,899
Take me away from here,
Raj. Take me away from here!

778
01:50:50,191 --> 01:50:54,024
What?
- You don't know

779
01:50:54,108 --> 01:50:57,774
what's going on in there!
Day after tomorrow is the engagement

780
01:50:58,233 --> 01:51:02,857
The wedding is after a fortnight.
All arrangements are in place

781
01:51:03,983 --> 01:51:08,857
Babuji gave his word to his friend.
And he lives by his word

782
01:51:10,066 --> 01:51:14,565
He can do anything,
but he can't go back on his word

783
01:51:15,650 --> 01:51:23,065
We have to run from here. We must!
- No Simran. l'm not eloping

784
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:27,982
l haven't come here to steal you.
l might have been born in England

785
01:51:28,441 --> 01:51:35,274
But l am Hindustani. l've come
here to take you as my bride.

786
01:51:36,233 --> 01:51:42,482
l'll take you only when
your Babuji gives me your hand

787
01:51:42,983 --> 01:51:45,357
You don't know my Babuji!

788
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:49,899
We have to get away from here, Raj.
Please Raj, take me away from here

789
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:59,024
Do you love me?
- More than anyone else

790
01:52:00,233 --> 01:52:03,940
Do you trust me?
- More than l trust myself

791
01:52:05,941 --> 01:52:10,899
Then listen carefully to what
l'm going to say. From now on..

792
01:52:10,983 --> 01:52:16,482
we're strangers. l don't know
you and you don't know me. Go back

793
01:52:16,566 --> 01:52:19,565
Let things happen as they're
happening. Leave the rest to me

794
01:52:21,275 --> 01:52:27,149
What l'm upto is daunting.
But l have complete faith in our love

795
01:52:28,275 --> 01:52:32,232
But alone l cannot
tread upon this path

796
01:52:32,941 --> 01:52:34,232
You will have to be my strength.

797
01:52:34,316 --> 01:52:40,690
You must co-operate. Tell me,
will you stand by me?

798
01:52:45,816 --> 01:52:51,232
Remember one more thing.
l'm here only for your sake

799
01:52:52,483 --> 01:52:59,065
Till l have you for
lifetime's sakes, l am not leaving

800
01:53:04,608 --> 01:53:10,315
Listen, what's the name of
the one you're marrying?

801
01:53:10,733 --> 01:53:12,399
Kuljit Singh

802
01:53:41,265 --> 01:53:44,473
Help! Anybody here?

803
01:53:44,807 --> 01:53:46,348
Somebody, help me!

804
01:53:46,432 --> 01:53:51,598
Where's everyone? Help!

805
01:54:12,474 --> 01:54:13,931
Anybody around?

806
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:27,264
Had Raj not arrived in the nick
of time, l would've been the prey

807
01:54:27,349 --> 01:54:31,223
Raj, l'm sold out!

808
01:54:31,307 --> 01:54:34,514
Where are you from?

809
01:54:35,182 --> 01:54:38,348
l've never seen you before.
- l'm from London

810
01:54:38,432 --> 01:54:42,931
Our guest from London!

811
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:50,139
What have you come here for?
- To achieve something

812
01:54:50,849 --> 01:54:52,931
To aChieve what? Do tell us

813
01:54:53,682 --> 01:54:56,014
Land.. land.
- Land?

814
01:54:56,099 --> 01:55:01,098
Yes, if l could find a good stretch
of land, l want to set up a faCtory

815
01:55:01,474 --> 01:55:05,889
Factory, making what?
- Beer

816
01:55:09,932 --> 01:55:12,681
Tell me something, Kuljit.
Will 8-1 0 million pounds..

817
01:55:12,765 --> 01:55:15,139
be enough to set up a factory?

818
01:55:16,015 --> 01:55:19,181
What happened?
- 8-1 0 million pounds?

819
01:55:19,224 --> 01:55:25,056
Too less? l can get more.
- No! That's a lot. Enough

820
01:55:27,515 --> 01:55:32,764
God is great! He makes us meet.
We'll get along fine together

821
01:55:32,849 --> 01:55:36,723
You want to set up a factory?
As good as done

822
01:55:36,807 --> 01:55:39,264
Done, my man

823
01:55:39,557 --> 01:55:40,848
By the way Raj..

824
01:55:43,015 --> 01:55:49,181
where are you staying?
- You see, l don't know anyone around

825
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:51,181
So l'm putting up at
the Circuit House.

826
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:55,014
Strange! Now you know me

827
01:55:55,432 --> 01:56:00,223
l have a palatial house! And you'll
stay at the circuit house? No way!

828
01:56:00,307 --> 01:56:03,181
Binda, go and get his luggage
from the circuit house. Drop it home

829
01:56:03,265 --> 01:56:06,014
What are you doing, Kuljit?
- Not a word

830
01:56:06,182 --> 01:56:09,556
You've saved my life, saved Kuljit!
Can't l do as much for you?

831
01:56:10,807 --> 01:56:14,723
l know, you're from London.
Here in Punjab, we're lions

832
01:56:15,057 --> 01:56:19,348
You're going to enjoy yourselves.
- Well, if you're forcing me..

833
01:56:19,807 --> 01:56:21,931
as you wish.
- That's like it!

834
01:56:22,015 --> 01:56:24,389
What about babes?

835
01:56:25,474 --> 01:56:28,181
We'll have a blast!

836
01:56:28,682 --> 01:56:30,306
You haven't gone yet?

837
01:56:30,682 --> 01:56:34,681
Go on Binda, hurry up.
Get a Black Label for Raj

838
01:56:34,765 --> 01:56:37,764
l'm going to have a scotCh with Raj

839
01:56:38,974 --> 01:56:44,139
Show me a cigarette, man. Strange!
The lighter too

840
01:56:49,849 --> 01:56:53,723
You have done us a great
favour in saving Kuljit's life

841
01:56:53,807 --> 01:56:59,639
No, it was my duty.
- May you live long, son

842
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:03,223
Preeti, give Raj some sweets

843
01:57:11,015 --> 01:57:12,348
Enough

844
01:57:13,265 --> 01:57:15,806
1 0 million pounds!
Why didn't you tell me before?

845
01:57:15,890 --> 01:57:19,639
l was about to..
- Raj! My son!

846
01:57:20,474 --> 01:57:22,056
The sweets.

847
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:25,764
Let me feed you. That's like it!
You want to set up a factory, no?

848
01:57:25,849 --> 01:57:27,848
We'll set it up for you.
- What was l telling you?

849
01:57:29,265 --> 01:57:31,639
Get dressed fast.
We're going to Baldev's for lunch

850
01:57:31,724 --> 01:57:34,931
Who's Baldev?
- He's my friend, man!

851
01:57:35,557 --> 01:57:39,473
His daughter is marrying my Kuljit

852
01:57:40,807 --> 01:57:45,181
What am l going to do over there?
- That's true. What will he do there?

853
01:57:45,224 --> 01:57:49,514
But if you insist, l'll come along.
- That's like it!

854
01:57:50,307 --> 01:57:55,181
Baldev is a bit British.
He'll mind it if we're late

855
01:57:55,265 --> 01:57:57,681
Let's make it on time.
- That's like it!

856
01:57:57,974 --> 01:58:01,348
You get dressed fast. We're
always getting late because of you

857
01:58:01,515 --> 01:58:05,056
Kuljit, l have something to tell you.

01:58:56,349 --> 01:58:58,056
How did the shopkeeper get here?

864
01:59:01,974 --> 01:59:03,806
l've seen you somewhere before.

865
01:59:03,890 --> 01:59:07,223
Not me. l never step out of the house

866
01:59:07,307 --> 01:59:11,264
ln London?
- But l haven't been beyond Ludhiana

867
01:59:13,265 --> 01:59:15,889
Have you met my friend Raj?
He has just arrived from London

868
01:59:15,974 --> 01:59:18,473
What are you saying?
- Balli, the doctor..

869
01:59:18,557 --> 01:59:22,389

Kuljit's life yesterday

870
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:28,139
You know who this is? The oldest

871
01:59:28,724 --> 01:59:31,014
What are you staring at?
TouCh his feet

872
01:59:31,099 --> 01:59:33,139
My respects

873
01:59:33,182 --> 01:59:36,264
Hurry! The doctor has
been asking for you for ages

874
01:59:38,307 --> 01:59:41,806
This doctor is a
wonderful fellow. Come on, man

875
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:45,056
Old foggie has quite a memory.
- What happened?

876
01:59:45,265 --> 01:59:49,889
Nothing. This is great! Lovely house!
- l told you

877
01:59:54,474 --> 01:59:58,848
This is Raj. My friend.
He has come from London

01:59:59,224 --> 02:00:01,681
This is Simran

879
02:00:03,390 --> 02:00:05,389
Namaste, Simran-ji

880
02:00:05,474 --> 02:00:10,764
Were it not for him yesterday,
you and l wouldn't be here together

881
02:00:10,974 --> 02:00:12,098
What a thing to say..

882
02:00:23,807 --> 02:00:27,889
Very glad to meet you, Ms Rajeshwari

883
02:00:28,182 --> 02:00:34,598
What is this?
- A little gift. For a little bride

884
02:00:42,182 --> 02:00:48,139
Mr. Raj, folks l like

885
02:00:50,724 --> 02:00:56,014
And folks who like me,

02:01:00,349 --> 02:01:03,181
Namaste, Simran-ji.
- Namaste

887
02:01:03,265 --> 02:01:04,973
Come on now

888
02:01:12,182 --> 02:01:14,431
This is Raj, my British friend

889
02:01:14,849 --> 02:01:17,223
The one l told you about.
- My respects

890
02:01:17,307 --> 02:01:19,098
May you live long, son.
- Coming

892
02:01:23,765 --> 02:01:27,973
Let me do the rest for you.
- No, you belong to the groomspeople

893
02:01:28,057 --> 02:01:32,098
You're our guest.
- How strange of you

894
02:01:32,474 --> 02:01:36,473
A moment ago you called me your son.
The next moment, you disown me?

895
02:01:37,724 --> 02:01:38,889
Allow me

896
02:01:45,432 --> 02:01:49,514
Just try this lassi. l made it
with my own hands! Here you are, Aunt

897
02:01:49,599 --> 02:01:52,056
Here you are Parjai-ji (Aunt).
This is for you, Aunt

898
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:54,348
That's a lovely dress

899
02:01:55,015 --> 02:01:56,889
Excuse me..

900
02:01:59,599 --> 02:02:00,806
After you

901
02:02:09,474 --> 02:02:12,431
Why are you taking all this trouble?
We kids can manage. Allow me

902
02:02:12,515 --> 02:02:15,181
That's what l've been saying all
along. But no one will listen to me

903
02:02:15,224 --> 02:02:17,681
l've been given all the work.
- That's my point

904
02:02:17,765 --> 02:02:21,014
Hey.. who are you?
- l? l'm Raj

905
02:02:21,099 --> 02:02:24,681
Raj, who?
- Your son-in-law to-be

906
02:02:25,349 --> 02:02:28,264
Kuljit is your son-in-law to-be,
no? l'm his friend

907
02:02:28,349 --> 02:02:32,181
Darling boy! Put the glasses there.
- Sure

908
02:02:32,265 --> 02:02:34,348
Such a darling!

909
02:02:39,057 --> 02:02:42,723
Today l see the best sign!
For the first time..

910
02:02:42,807 --> 02:02:46,389
l'm seeing Simran
laughing with such mirth!

911
02:02:49,182 --> 02:02:52,556
Give that to me.
- l won't

912
02:02:55,390 --> 02:02:59,598
True, Ma-ji. Simran
looks very cheerful

913
02:03:18,807 --> 02:03:21,848
Sweet? Salted?

914
02:03:26,765 --> 02:03:32,264
Nothing's happening for
Raj here! Get ready to leave

915
02:04:37,807 --> 02:04:40,348
Son of an Englishman! Get up!
Hurry! We're going hunting

916
02:04:46,765 --> 02:04:49,973
Look at him. Aren't
you coming? Get up.

917
02:04:50,182 --> 02:04:52,806
l'm sick. l have high fever

918
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:56,306
Caught such a chill last night,
l slept in my shoes, you know

919
02:04:56,390 --> 02:05:00,098
You're wearing only one shoe.
- That's the leg that caught the chill

920
02:05:00,182 --> 02:05:04,556
Sorry friend,
l just can't go hunting with you

921
02:05:06,515 --> 02:05:10,181
You British are so feeble.
l'll send medicines for you

922
02:05:10,265 --> 02:05:11,556
Make sure you're fine by this evening.

923
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:14,306
We're having fowl for dinner.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

924
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:15,973
Hey Kuljit..

925
02:05:21,682 --> 02:05:24,389
Come on Raj, get started

926
02:05:25,932 --> 02:05:30,056
What's this?
- Keep moving

927
02:05:30,432 --> 02:05:34,848
What's all this Raj?
- Wonderful thing happened today

928
02:05:34,932 --> 02:05:39,806
Met a minister on my way. Turns
out to be my Daddy's Childhood friend

929
02:05:39,890 --> 02:05:43,223
He gave me all this. Let me take
care of that. Don't tire yourself

930
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:47,473
l'm a lone fellow you know. What use
this sugar, rice and wheat for me?

931
02:05:47,557 --> 02:05:49,681
So l thought l'd bring it over.
There's a wedding in the offing here

932
02:05:49,765 --> 02:05:52,514
Could be useful, no?
- Maybe so, son

933
02:05:52,599 --> 02:05:55,223
But we're the bridespeople.
Can't take anything from you

934
02:05:55,307 --> 02:05:59,223
Not again. Once and for all,
deCide what you take me for

935
02:05:59,307 --> 02:06:02,806
Either you don't call me a son,
or you treat me like a son

936
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:06,389
How do you treat sons?
- You don't argue with sons

937
02:06:06,974 --> 02:06:09,764
All right. l won't argue.
- That's like it

938
02:06:10,307 --> 02:06:13,723
Now listen to the real thing, Ma-ji.
My mother used to say..

939
02:06:14,307 --> 02:06:18,556
one who helps out with a wedding,
gets a pretty bride

940
02:06:20,057 --> 02:06:23,723
All this, for a pretty bride?
- What else? Only lucky ones..

941
02:06:23,807 --> 02:06:27,639
find good brides nowadays.
- What kind of a bride d'you want?

942
02:06:32,057 --> 02:06:35,806
Say, someone like you

943
02:06:37,182 --> 02:06:39,264
Don't say that. Give
me your blessings.

944
02:06:39,349 --> 02:06:41,806
Granted. You'll get a bride you want

945
02:06:42,515 --> 02:06:45,764
All right, l'm off.
- Will you please open this?

946
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:52,098
lt's going to open

947
02:06:53,099 --> 02:06:56,806
Aunt, don't keep looking,
don't even think. Just take it

948
02:06:56,890 --> 02:06:59,514
Stuff like this is hard to
find even in Delhi or Bombay

949
02:06:59,599 --> 02:07:02,973
Just wear it and step out,
and you'll make the girls stare

950
02:07:03,057 --> 02:07:07,514
Don't even ask me about the boys.
- lt's nice

951
02:07:14,015 --> 02:07:15,264
Not special

952
02:07:15,349 --> 02:07:20,431
You show me that one.
- Okay. Here you are

953
02:07:20,515 --> 02:07:25,556
Superb stuff. Just take a look at
the borders. On you, resplendent

954
02:07:27,432 --> 02:07:30,639
Such bad ones! lf you have
something speCial, show me

955
02:07:30,724 --> 02:07:33,681
l have to wear it for the wedding.
- Here you are

956
02:07:34,099 --> 02:07:39,348
This is for weddings. lf you
aren't pleased, l'm no connoisseur

957
02:07:39,515 --> 02:07:43,723
Pure gold thread. On you,
looks exotic!

958
02:07:44,057 --> 02:07:47,181
Don't talk rot! lt's not that good

959
02:07:52,765 --> 02:07:56,723
Not that bad either. l'll keep it

960
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:04,181
Pack it. And put a good price

961
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:08,098
You've worn me out

962
02:08:39,974 --> 02:08:43,431
Raj, let's have a song from you.
- l can't sing

963
02:08:43,515 --> 02:08:46,098
Coy like a girl? Sing.
- Oh no Grannie..

964
02:08:46,182 --> 02:08:49,681
Sing.. please

965
02:08:51,057 --> 02:08:57,139
l'm in love, why am l afraid?

966
02:08:57,307 --> 02:09:00,056
l've loved, l haven't stolen anything

967
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:02,264
Why should l weep secretly?

968
02:09:02,349 --> 02:09:07,973
l'm in love, why am l afraid?

969
02:09:10,807 --> 02:09:15,098
What else have l to do?
- l'm in loνe, why am l afraid?

970
02:09:19,349 --> 02:09:23,431
You've got your aim all wrong

971
02:09:27,890 --> 02:09:32,139
Forget it, you can't even sing

972
02:09:40,682 --> 02:09:45,639
The loνer will carry his bride away

973
02:09:50,765 --> 02:09:56,098
The bridespeople will be left gaping

974
02:10:01,432 --> 02:10:06,889
The loνer will carry his bride away

975
02:10:11,349 --> 02:10:13,806
What are you doing?
Everyone's out there! Let go!

976
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:15,264
On one condition.
- What?

977
02:10:15,349 --> 02:10:17,139
Give me a kiss Senorita.
- Are you crazy?

978
02:10:17,182 --> 02:10:20,723
One kiss.
- Ma might see!

979
02:10:23,724 --> 02:10:24,973
Let her see

980
02:10:26,682 --> 02:10:30,181
Chutki might see!
- Let her see

981
02:10:32,224 --> 02:10:36,473
Aunt might come by.
- Let her come.

982
02:10:47,057 --> 02:10:50,056
This Babuji is going to get me killed!

983
02:10:53,765 --> 02:10:57,348
What are you wondering Baldev?
There's no countermove

984
02:10:57,890 --> 02:11:01,389
First time in 20 years,
l have you cheCkmated

985
02:11:02,974 --> 02:11:08,348
Good move, indeed.
This once l'm checkmated

986
02:11:10,974 --> 02:11:16,056
That's check. And mate.
- Wonderful!

987
02:11:16,140 --> 02:11:18,306
Yes Babuji, l'm wonderful

988
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:19,973
How did he checkmate?

989
02:11:21,057 --> 02:11:26,264
No, l'll put it back.
- No, let me take a look

990
02:11:52,099 --> 02:11:53,889
What happened?

991
02:11:56,099 --> 02:11:57,931
You know what's
about to happen tomorrow?

992
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:00,556
What?

993
02:12:02,307 --> 02:12:04,681
Tomorrow, l'm going to
be engaged to Kuljit

994
02:12:13,849 --> 02:12:18,514
Tomorrow, Kuljit will
put a ring on this finger

995
02:12:20,932 --> 02:12:25,181
You know why the engagement
ring is worn on this finger?

996
02:12:28,307 --> 02:12:32,514
Because the artery from this
finger leads straight to the heart

997
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:38,431
l can't wear anyone
else's ring but yours, Raj

998
02:12:39,182 --> 02:12:42,514
lf you want me to walk up in
front of everyone with a ring..

999
02:12:42,599 --> 02:12:45,973
and put it on you,
l'll do it. No problem

1000
02:12:46,849 --> 02:12:50,014
All this is a great joke for you,
isn't it? What l'm going through..

1001
02:12:50,099 --> 02:12:53,598

..you can never imagine.
- Look at me

1002
02:12:53,682 --> 02:12:55,556
Look

1003
02:12:56,349 --> 02:13:02,014
l feel everything Simran, the way
you're pining, your pain, your tears

1004
02:13:03,182 --> 02:13:06,139
But why don't you understand?
This is just the beginning

1005
02:13:06,807 --> 02:13:09,556
These people haven't even
gotten to know me properly

1006
02:13:10,807 --> 02:13:16,223
l need more time,
Simran. And l need your support

1007
02:13:17,182 --> 02:13:24,014
l want you to smile. And listen,
no son of a gun can take you..

1008
02:13:24,390 --> 02:13:27,639
away from me, using just a ring

1009
02:13:29,099 --> 02:13:33,139
You're mine, only mine

1010
02:13:40,765 --> 02:13:43,264
Chutki might wake up. Go away

1011
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:47,014
. Listen

1012
02:14:10,307 --> 02:14:11,556
Didi..

1013
02:14:13,974 --> 02:14:17,098
Can l say something?
- Go on

1014
02:14:17,390 --> 02:14:23,389
l don't like this Kuljit
one bit. Don't marry him

1015
02:14:24,182 --> 02:14:26,639
lt's νery late. Go to sleep

1016
02:14:27,724 --> 02:14:33,514
Didi, l like the one
who was on the roof

1017
02:14:36,307 --> 02:14:37,681
What did you say?

1018
02:14:43,182 --> 02:14:48,014
Didi, isn't Raj the
one you met in Europe?

1019
02:14:52,057 --> 02:14:53,223
Yes

1020
02:14:54,182 --> 02:14:59,848
l like him a lot! You marry him.
- Don't you worry

1021
02:15:00,224 --> 02:15:02,181
He's the one l'm marrying

1022
02:15:08,974 --> 02:15:13,139
Yes Grannie?
- Pistachios for the sherbet

1023
02:15:13,182 --> 02:15:14,431
Done

1024
02:15:15,307 --> 02:15:19,014
Raj, where are the flowers?
- You put them beside the staircase

1025
02:15:19,099 --> 02:15:22,389
Oh l forgot! Were it not for you,
everything would be topsy-turvy

1026
02:15:22,474 --> 02:15:26,973
That's what l'm saying. The
lover will take his bride away

1027
02:15:27,057 --> 02:15:30,556
Raj, weren't you with the
groomspeople? Have you switched over..

1028
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:34,681
to the bridespeople?
- Someday l'll have a bride too, no?

1029
02:15:34,765 --> 02:15:38,764
Just putting in some practice.
Get it? - Never mind. Get lost

1030
02:15:38,849 --> 02:15:40,056
Son of a gun

1031
02:15:59,015 --> 02:16:01,806
Kuljit is so lucky!
- Really

1032
02:16:08,890 --> 02:16:10,473
Now give her yours

1033
02:16:14,807 --> 02:16:16,806
Simran, offer your hand

1034
02:16:18,057 --> 02:16:20,681
Simran, put your hand out

1035
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:26,931
Come on

1036
02:16:30,807 --> 02:16:32,306
What's this?

1037
02:16:32,474 --> 02:16:37,889
Last night, while taking off
my bangles, l hurt my finger

1038
02:16:41,474 --> 02:16:44,348
Never mind. The other hand

1039
02:16:54,974 --> 02:16:59,056
"These girls are poison pills"

1040
02:16:59,974 --> 02:17:04,056
"These boys are rogues"

1041
02:17:09,349 --> 02:17:12,514
"Poison pills"
- "Rogues"

1042
02:17:21,974 --> 02:17:24,389
"Make sure you're painted with henna"

1043
02:17:24,599 --> 02:17:26,848
"Make sure the
bride's palanquin is ready"

1044
02:17:31,974 --> 02:17:36,764
"To take you away,
o'beauty, your lover is coming"

1045
02:17:53,849 --> 02:17:58,514
"Make sure you come with your faCe
hidden behind the bridegroom's sehra"

1046
02:18:03,640 --> 02:18:08,556
"lt's a matter of hearts.
Keep it in your heart"

1047
02:18:46,474 --> 02:18:51,264
"For a signal from
your flying tresses.."

1048
02:18:51,349 --> 02:18:56,181
"with bated breath, the
baChelors await your suit"

1049
02:18:56,224 --> 02:19:00,931
"The maidens will go
into hiding out of shame.."

1050
02:19:01,015 --> 02:19:05,764
"for these are all madmen
from town Come to our village"

1051
02:19:05,849 --> 02:19:15,348
"Keep your eyes
downcast; keep yourself chaste"

1052
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:20,598
"To take you away,
o'beauty, your lover is coming"

1053
02:19:59,557 --> 02:20:04,348
"l'm a young boy;
you're a pretty girl"

1054
02:20:04,515 --> 02:20:09,223
"lf our hearts are swayed,
what's my crime?"

1055
02:20:09,307 --> 02:20:14,056
"You should've held your heart.
This beauty is magic"

1056
02:20:14,182 --> 02:20:18,931
"lf the magic is working,
what's my crime?"

1057
02:20:19,015 --> 02:20:28,556
"Keep up for me, leave the door ajar"

1058
02:20:28,849 --> 02:20:33,764
"To take you away,
o'beauty, your lover is coming"

1059
02:20:33,849 --> 02:20:43,473
"Say no more now, do no more now"

1060
02:20:43,557 --> 02:20:48,389
"lt's a matter of hearts.
Keep it in your heart"

1061
02:20:48,474 --> 02:20:52,973
"Make sure you're painted with henna;
make sure your palanquin is ready"

1062
02:20:53,307 --> 02:20:58,056
"Make sure you come with your faCe
hidden behind the bridegroom's sehra"

1063
02:22:01,057 --> 02:22:04,056
"O'my precious one.."

1064
02:22:05,599 --> 02:22:09,889
"O'my precious one.."
- "you know not.."

1065
02:22:10,057 --> 02:22:14,348
"you're still pretty,
and l'm still young"

1066
02:22:14,432 --> 02:22:18,598
"l Could still die for you, my love"

1067
02:22:45,140 --> 02:22:49,514
"Make sure you're painted with henna;
make sure your palanquin is ready"

1068
02:22:49,807 --> 02:22:54,056
"Make sure you come with your faCe
hidden behind the bridegroom's sehra"

1069
02:23:59,724 --> 02:24:04,723
Babuji, yesterday you were wonderful!
What a danCe! Bested all the others

1070
02:24:17,599 --> 02:24:20,931
No Babuji, just a speCk
of dirt. Now it's clean

1071
02:24:27,057 --> 02:24:31,848
Too few doves, don't you think?
The whites ones..

1072
02:24:32,432 --> 02:24:37,473
look.. one, two, three

1073
02:24:39,890 --> 02:24:42,348
No, maybe same like yesterday

1074
02:25:01,432 --> 02:25:07,223
l've decided. Today l'm
talking it over with Raj

1075
02:25:07,307 --> 02:25:10,764
ls it something to be ashamed of?
- Raj is here

1076
02:25:10,974 --> 02:25:12,764
Back? So early?

1077
02:25:12,849 --> 02:25:18,806
Raj! My precious son! Come here.
We were just talking of you

1078
02:25:24,140 --> 02:25:27,431
l've something important to tell you.
- Sure, go on

1079
02:25:27,515 --> 02:25:33,056
This ought to be discussed by elders.
But since you're so close to us..

1080
02:25:33,265 --> 02:25:35,431
l thought, why not talk to you?
- Tell me

1081
02:25:35,515 --> 02:25:40,348
l wish this friendship
to become a relationship

1082
02:25:40,432 --> 02:25:44,181
Why not, why not?
- For my daughter, Preeti..

1083
02:25:44,515 --> 02:25:47,473
l seek your hand

1084
02:25:50,974 --> 02:25:55,348
Raj! Better think up something fast!
Else, they have you trussed!

1085
02:25:55,432 --> 02:26:00,181
Raj, have you any objections?
- What? Oh no. How could l?

1086
02:26:01,932 --> 02:26:03,598
My son!
- But l can't take..

1087
02:26:03,682 --> 02:26:07,014
such a big decision all by myself.
So you will have to talk to Pops

1088
02:26:07,099 --> 02:26:08,348
Pops?
- Father

1089
02:26:09,807 --> 02:26:13,306
See? What a good boy!
- l never do anything..

1090
02:26:13,390 --> 02:26:17,639
against my father's wishes.
- No problem. Give me his number

1091
02:26:17,724 --> 02:26:19,556
l'll talk to him over telephone

1092
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:26,181
He's away in America on business.
- Great! Gone to America!

1093
02:26:26,265 --> 02:26:30,723
Let him ask him to come over.
- No problem

1094
02:26:35,182 --> 02:26:40,389
My country, my soil,
my Raj! Here l Come, son

1095
02:26:43,224 --> 02:26:46,806
Step out of the Country,
and you'll find everything..

1096
02:26:46,890 --> 02:26:50,223
but the matthri your wife serves up.
- Compliments, lady

1097
02:26:50,307 --> 02:26:55,014
Neither the pickles, nor the culture.
For one who loves the Ganga.

1098
02:26:55,099 --> 02:27:01,181
what's a Thames? So l told Raj
to return only with his bride

1099
02:27:01,474 --> 02:27:03,181
That's like it!
- Such conviCtion

1100
02:27:03,224 --> 02:27:05,806
What do you do in London?
- Back in London..

1101
02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:09,139
London?
- Forget London. All l know is..

1102
02:27:09,182 --> 02:27:11,639
Go East, go West, Punjab is the best!

1103
02:27:12,557 --> 02:27:14,639
Son!

1104
02:27:18,682 --> 02:27:20,348
Don't you worry.
l've got it all tied up

1105
02:27:27,307 --> 02:27:29,556
You don't even
introduce me to your Daddy

1106
02:27:29,724 --> 02:27:32,764
What a wonder! Just this morning,
we were talking about him..

1107
02:27:32,849 --> 02:27:36,723
and l find him in the marketplace,
armed with a photo, asking about you

1108
02:27:37,057 --> 02:27:42,181
Whatever anyone says, this marriage
was made in Heaven! Right, lady?

1109
02:27:42,224 --> 02:27:44,556
Right.

1110
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:48,598
You're strange! You don't need
my permission for a good deed

1111
02:27:48,682 --> 02:27:51,098
What do you mean no?
Have l ever refused you anything

1112
02:27:51,182 --> 02:27:53,556
How about sweets?
Your son-in-law is waiting

1113
02:27:53,640 --> 02:27:54,764
Right away!
- Go on!

1114
02:27:54,849 --> 02:27:57,848
The wedding must be done right away!
A good deed can't wait

1115
02:27:57,932 --> 02:28:01,598
l was thinking of Kuljit and Raj
getting married at the same time

1116
02:28:01,974 --> 02:28:03,056
What was that?

1117
02:28:06,099 --> 02:28:10,139
lt's final!
- Raj, are you happy?

1118
02:28:12,057 --> 02:28:15,598
Give me a sweet!
Quick! My son is happy!

1119
02:28:18,390 --> 02:28:23,723
Now you're marrying Preeti.
Her brother is Kuljit..

1120
02:28:23,807 --> 02:28:30,431
the one who's about to marry Simran.
And you love Simran. Not Preeti

1121
02:28:30,515 --> 02:28:34,056
What was Preeti doing in London?
- Not Preeti. ln London, it was Simran

1122
02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:39,348
Yes, Simran.. who's this Simran?
- Pops! Just give up thinking! Please

1123
02:28:39,432 --> 02:28:41,681
Can anything be done
without giving it a thought?

1124
02:28:41,765 --> 02:28:48,598
l'm here. Everything will be all right.
- By now, it's done already!

1125
02:28:48,682 --> 02:28:50,806
Wedding must be done right away!

1126
02:28:50,890 --> 02:28:53,806
Good deed can't wait!
Why did you come?

1127
02:28:59,057 --> 02:29:03,764
lt was a mistake! Won't happen again.
l'll tell them that l forgot..

1128
02:29:03,849 --> 02:29:05,639
about your mother's death anniversary.

1129
02:29:05,724 --> 02:29:07,431
Matter laid to rest for a month

1130
02:29:11,057 --> 02:29:13,931
May l come in?
- Sure, come right in

1131
02:29:14,015 --> 02:29:19,098
You're going to live very long.
Raj and l were just talking of you

1132
02:29:19,182 --> 02:29:20,598
Sit

1133
02:29:20,682 --> 02:29:23,806
You sit too. Milk for me? Thank you!

1134
02:29:24,224 --> 02:29:26,556
Tomorrow's Karwa Chauth.
- What's Karwa Chauth?

1135
02:29:28,099 --> 02:29:31,014
l'd like to keep fast for
Raj's well-being. May l?

1136
02:29:31,099 --> 02:29:33,681
Sure, no problem!
- Karwa Chauth, Pops?

1137
02:29:33,765 --> 02:29:37,181
Karwa Chauth? No! Never!

1138
02:29:37,224 --> 02:29:40,723
Why?
- We consider it a bad omen..

1139
02:29:40,807 --> 02:29:43,264
for a girl to observe the ritual
for her husband before her marriage

1140
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:48,598
Besides my child, we can't
discuss the liaison for a month

1141
02:29:48,682 --> 02:29:53,598
lt was during this month
that Raj's mother passed away

1142
02:29:55,182 --> 02:29:58,889
We have to fix another date for the
wedding. Let's talk to your father

1143
02:29:58,974 --> 02:30:01,389
Ajit..

1144
02:30:12,057 --> 02:30:16,098
Raj, you know what day it is tomorrow?

1145
02:30:17,807 --> 02:30:22,806
What's it now?
- My first Karwa Chauth

1146
02:30:23,265 --> 02:30:26,014
l want you to give me water..

1147
02:30:26,349 --> 02:30:29,014
and feed me the first
morsel of food after my fast

1148
02:30:29,599 --> 02:30:31,348
Hands off.
- What?

1149
02:30:31,432 --> 02:30:33,139
l told you. Hands off

1150
02:30:35,932 --> 02:30:40,931
Simran, if you don't love me,
just tell me straight. l'll go away

1151
02:30:41,015 --> 02:30:45,389
Then you can marry Kuljit. lt's going
to save me this everyday melodrama

1152
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:49,681
ls it something l said?
- But you never say anything, no?

1153
02:30:50,432 --> 02:30:54,556
l want you to give me water
and feed me the first morsel..

1154
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:56,098
of food after my fast.

1155
02:30:56,182 --> 02:30:58,723
Are you out of your mind? You expeCt me
to make a grand entry saying..

1156
02:30:58,807 --> 02:31:03,264
"Hi Simran! l'm your husband-to-be!
Here, take a drink of water"

1157
02:31:03,599 --> 02:31:05,639
l don't care! l'll even die of hunger!

1158
02:31:05,724 --> 02:31:07,723
But the first drink of water,
and the first morsel of food..

1159
02:31:07,807 --> 02:31:08,889
you will feed me! Get it?

1160
02:31:13,849 --> 02:31:15,348
Just like her father

1161
02:31:16,099 --> 02:31:19,848
So why should l be
the butt of the joke?

1162
02:31:23,432 --> 02:31:28,139
You're unique, Mr. Malhotra.
Your dress doesn't indicate..

1163
02:31:28,182 --> 02:31:32,473
your affinity to Hindustan.
- The dress has fooled even you?

1164
02:31:33,057 --> 02:31:36,181
l keep Hindustan in my heart.
- Wonderful!

1165
02:31:36,265 --> 02:31:40,181
Wonderful?

1166
02:31:43,015 --> 02:31:47,014
Ajit was saying you're
here to set up a factory?

1167
02:31:47,099 --> 02:31:50,264
The factory is just an exCuse.
lf you ask me the truth..

1168
02:31:50,349 --> 02:31:52,931
l'm here to choose a bride for Raj

1169
02:31:54,265 --> 02:31:57,389
Then men are all out in the outhouse

1170
02:31:57,474 --> 02:32:01,181
They say, they don't want
to disturb us on Ladies' Day

1171
02:32:02,474 --> 02:32:06,098
Are you keeping a fast too?
- Yes

1172
02:32:08,515 --> 02:32:13,181
May you live long, my child.
My Kuljit is lucky to get

1173
02:32:13,515 --> 02:32:16,931
a bride like you. Come

1174
02:32:19,974 --> 02:32:23,223
Ma-ji, this is my Pops. Father

1175
02:32:25,724 --> 02:32:27,681
Your son has cast a
spell over everyone here

1176
02:32:27,765 --> 02:32:29,806
That's my son

1177
02:32:29,890 --> 02:32:33,348
l'll join you

1178
02:32:35,390 --> 02:32:39,264
Pops, this is..
- l know

1179
02:32:40,515 --> 02:32:42,431
She can only be Simran

1180
02:32:57,057 --> 02:32:58,348
May you live long

1181
02:33:10,807 --> 02:33:14,223
No one even watches his step.
Hold this. The flowers!

1182
02:33:20,432 --> 02:33:24,598
"Let it rain flowers!"

1183
02:33:24,682 --> 02:33:28,764
"My beloved is here"

1184
02:33:45,057 --> 02:33:48,639
Kammo, where are the flowers?
Hurry up

1185
02:33:53,099 --> 02:33:57,139
l'm Raj's father. From London.
- From London?

1186
02:33:57,182 --> 02:34:01,098
Actually from Bhatinda. But l've been
in London for many years. You?

1187
02:34:01,182 --> 02:34:04,598
l'm Simran's Aunt.
- You can't be!

1188
02:34:04,682 --> 02:34:06,973
What?
- You could be her sister

1189
02:34:08,349 --> 02:34:15,139
Listen.. aren't you keeping fast?
- No. l'm still a maiden

1190
02:34:15,182 --> 02:34:17,973
Nothing could've been better.
- What?

1191
02:34:18,057 --> 02:34:25,014
One of your flowers.
- Maybe it's for you. Keep it

1192
02:34:40,474 --> 02:34:42,806
When is the moon going
to rise? l'm starving

1193
02:34:42,890 --> 02:34:45,223
l hope it kills you.
Did l ask you to fast?

1194
02:34:51,807 --> 02:34:54,181
Eat this on the sly. No one's looking

1195
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:56,306
Don't

1196
02:34:59,724 --> 02:35:02,764
The moon is up.
- Where?

1197
02:35:02,849 --> 02:35:04,056
There

1198
02:35:33,224 --> 02:35:41,764
"On this night of prayer
for the wedded woman.."

1199
02:35:44,682 --> 02:35:49,806
"l look at the moon,
l pray with folded hands"

1200
02:35:50,057 --> 02:35:55,264
"Then l break my fast"

1201
02:35:56,890 --> 02:36:02,223
"Give me the water, take
your slave for your queen"

1202
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:07,764
"Tonight, give me what l desire"

1203
02:36:07,849 --> 02:36:13,014
"Come home o'wanderer,
your beloved beCkons"

1204
02:36:24,724 --> 02:36:26,723
What happened?
- Water

1205
02:36:28,474 --> 02:36:30,889
Simi, my child
- Drink water

1206
02:36:31,474 --> 02:36:36,306
What happened? What happened to her?
- She swooned

1207
02:36:37,515 --> 02:36:40,556
Get up. Come, my child

1208
02:36:43,140 --> 02:36:46,264
What happened?
- lt's all right. She just swooned

1209
02:36:48,265 --> 02:36:52,306
lt's nothing. Come on, let's eat

1210
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:55,889
She's so fragile, no?

1211
02:36:58,349 --> 02:37:00,806
Why are you anxious?
Are you fasting too?

1212
02:37:01,015 --> 02:37:03,014
No..
- Then come along

1213
02:37:04,224 --> 02:37:11,973
lt isn't easy for him to get away.
Everyone's asking for Raj all the time

1214
02:37:12,265 --> 02:37:15,764
He won't be able to come, Didi.
Please, eat something

1215
02:37:15,849 --> 02:37:22,098
l won't! l'd rather die starving.
- Very well, kill yourself

1216
02:37:28,724 --> 02:37:36,014
l'm sorry, l'm late. But what to do?
They weren't about to leave me

1217
02:37:36,099 --> 02:37:39,681
lt was tough getting away. Here, eat

1218
02:37:40,015 --> 02:37:41,514
Eat, didi

1219
02:37:43,765 --> 02:37:48,764
l said l'm sorry. Now eat.
Else, you'll swoon for real

1220
02:37:52,515 --> 02:37:57,306
Chutki, tell him there's no
need for him to worry for me

1221
02:37:57,932 --> 02:38:04,306
l was about to faint of hunger.
And there he was, filling his stomach

1222
02:38:05,140 --> 02:38:10,223
Anyway, it's my first Karwa Chauth.
Why should he get so worked up?

1223
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:12,431
Whether l live or die, is he bothered?

1224
02:38:12,515 --> 02:38:17,139
You don't know this. But Raj
hasn't eaten anything all day either

1225
02:38:17,557 --> 02:38:22,431
He wanted to break fast with you.
And he told me not to tell you

1226
02:38:22,807 --> 02:38:25,681
Sorry Raj, but l Couldn't keep
shut any longer

1227
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:36,973
Come here

1228
02:38:38,140 --> 02:38:41,139
Talking to me?
- Come here

1229
02:38:57,349 --> 02:39:01,473
l got carried away.
- No matter, Senorita

1230
02:39:01,807 --> 02:39:05,056
ln big places, such
small things happen

1231
02:39:11,265 --> 02:39:14,556
My turn Senorita. Feed me

1232
02:39:35,390 --> 02:39:40,098
l told you, not to betray my trust.
Simran hasn't forgotten him yet?

1233
02:39:40,182 --> 02:39:42,806
lf she remembers, she'll regret it

1234
02:39:46,057 --> 02:39:49,181
What happened to me
won't happen to my daughter

1235
02:39:49,265 --> 02:39:53,639
No more saCrifices at every step
as daughter, as sister, as wife

1236
02:39:53,724 --> 02:39:58,223
She'll live life as she wishes.
She'll have her share of happiness

1237
02:40:04,015 --> 02:40:05,223
Come in

1238
02:40:31,182 --> 02:40:32,806
Keep this

1239
02:40:33,265 --> 02:40:38,014
Ma, this?
- Not a word! l know everything

1240
02:40:39,224 --> 02:40:45,181
l've seen everything. Raj is the
one you met in Europe. l know

1241
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:48,973
l also know, the two of
you love eaCh other dearly

1242
02:40:49,515 --> 02:40:54,889
l was wrong Simran! My daughter
won't sacrifice her happiness

1243
02:40:55,599 --> 02:40:58,181
She isn't going to sacrifiCe her love

1244
02:41:01,057 --> 02:41:08,223
l know Raj, you'll make my daughter
very happy. You have my blessings

1245
02:41:08,807 --> 02:41:11,848
Take my daughter away. Leave

1246
02:41:12,515 --> 02:41:18,139
No one here Cares for your love.
Take her away from here

1247
02:41:19,265 --> 02:41:21,556
l'll take care of everything.
- No Ma-ji

1248
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:27,973
l don't want to hear anything! No!
Take her away, lest my resolve weakens

1249
02:41:28,057 --> 02:41:31,181
Please go away from here!

1250
02:41:31,640 --> 02:41:35,764
l beg of you, son!
- l will Ma-ji. l'll take her away

1251
02:41:37,932 --> 02:41:42,223
Come.. sit here

1252
02:41:44,974 --> 02:41:46,931
Keep this

1253
02:41:49,599 --> 02:41:54,056
Ma-ji, l was a little boy
when my mother passed away

1254
02:41:55,182 --> 02:41:57,973
But whatever l am today,
is beCause of her

1255
02:41:59,224 --> 02:42:04,306
To this day l haven't forgotten
something she said. She'd say..

1256
02:42:04,932 --> 02:42:11,514
"Son, at every turn in life, you'll
find two roads. One right, one wrong"

1257
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:17,764
"The wrong route will be easy,
it will draw you. But the right path.."

1258
02:42:17,849 --> 02:42:21,473
"will be hard, with lots of hazards,
a lot many troubles"

1259
02:42:23,015 --> 02:42:29,681
"On the wrong road, initially,
you might find success, happiness"

1260
02:42:30,765 --> 02:42:38,764
"But in the end, you will lose.
Upon the right path, initially.."

1261
02:42:38,849 --> 02:42:43,348
"you may trip at every step,
you may faCe hazards, difficulties"

1262
02:42:45,182 --> 02:42:49,181
"But in the end, you will always win"

1263
02:42:52,599 --> 02:42:59,806
Now you tell me, Ma-ji.
Am l on the right, or in the wrong?

1264
02:43:04,182 --> 02:43:10,889
Your way is absolutely right,
son. But you don't know my husband

1265
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:17,723
And Ma-ji, your
husband doesn't know me

1266
02:43:19,265 --> 02:43:24,639
lf l wanted to elope with Simran,
l could've done it already

1267
02:43:25,932 --> 02:43:30,098
But l want to be given Simran.
l don't want to steal her

1268
02:43:31,057 --> 02:43:35,598
l don't want to take her away
on the sly. l want to do it openly

1269
02:43:36,932 --> 02:43:41,973
lf l have come,
l'll surely carry my bride away

1270
02:43:42,807 --> 02:43:49,889
But only when Babuji gives me
her hand, of his own νolition

1271
02:43:52,057 --> 02:43:55,348
Now Simran isn't your problem.
She's my headache

1272
02:43:56,182 --> 02:43:58,931
As for you, you have
given your daughter away

1273
02:43:59,890 --> 02:44:03,723
Just a matter of time now
before the bride is carried away

1274
02:44:15,182 --> 02:44:20,514
ls this crying illness in the genes?

1275
02:44:37,182 --> 02:44:42,181
How strange Uncle-ji! Tell me.
- The girl.. what's her name?

1276
02:44:42,224 --> 02:44:45,556
Yes Simran. l don't
approve of the match

1277
02:44:46,557 --> 02:44:50,473
Why Uncle-ji?
- Girl's fine. But no match for you

1278
02:44:50,557 --> 02:44:57,973
You're a strong young Jatt d'Punjab!
And this girl is frail, subdued

1279
02:44:58,057 --> 02:45:02,973
ls this any match? Match for
you is a girl like a sparkler!

1280
02:45:03,182 --> 02:45:06,306
Just come with me to London.
The girls l'll introduce you to..

1281
02:45:06,390 --> 02:45:08,306
will drive you crazy!

1282
02:45:09,724 --> 02:45:15,098
What's the problem, Uncle-ji?
After the wedding, Simran stays here

1283
02:45:15,182 --> 02:45:19,556
And we're going to be in London,
meeting your sparklers!

1284
02:45:23,890 --> 02:45:28,764
Pull out all the stops!
- You son of a gun

1285
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:42,556
As a little boy, l'd ride out to
the fields on my father's shoulders

1286
02:45:43,765 --> 02:45:46,473
Ever since, l struck up a
friendship with these doves

1287
02:45:48,057 --> 02:45:50,764
l find it so peaceful out here

1288
02:45:51,724 --> 02:45:57,098
l love spending time with the doves

1289
02:45:58,599 --> 02:46:06,014
Tell me Babuji, are the doves here
any different from the doves in London?

1290
02:46:11,307 --> 02:46:16,639
Difference there is. The doves here
know me, they recognise me

1291
02:46:16,932 --> 02:46:22,431
They belong to my land.
Even the doves out there are alien

1292
02:46:23,182 --> 02:46:31,889
Could it be that you perceive it
differently? Maybe a dove out there

1293
02:46:31,974 --> 02:46:38,514
took to wings from here from
your land.. one who knows you..

1294
02:46:39,015 --> 02:46:44,514
one who recognises you.
Maybe you don't recognise him?

1295
02:46:53,932 --> 02:46:55,181
What happened?

1296
02:46:59,599 --> 02:47:03,681
What are you doing?
- My Ma used to say..

1297
02:47:03,765 --> 02:47:07,598
the soil of our land is very
powerful. lt's going to be fine

1298
02:47:08,265 --> 02:47:11,181
But this is outrageous!
Who might've done this?

1299
02:47:16,015 --> 02:47:18,264
Babuji, look

1300
02:47:26,307 --> 02:47:28,389
Let's go.
- Babuji..

1301
02:47:30,640 --> 02:47:33,598
Are you still angry about my beer act?

1302
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:39,598
l was childish. Won't you forgive me?

1303
02:47:41,182 --> 02:47:43,723
l forgot that long ago

1304
02:47:44,390 --> 02:47:49,223
l was wrong about you. You're right

1305
02:47:50,682 --> 02:47:56,181
l didn't recognise. Come, let's go

1306
02:48:05,057 --> 02:48:10,514
Ma-ji, what is the matter?
You asked for me?

1307
02:48:11,099 --> 02:48:15,264
Son, whatever the doctor might say..

1308
02:48:15,724 --> 02:48:20,264
l know my time's up

1309
02:48:20,349 --> 02:48:24,473
Speak of niCe things,
Ma-ji. What a thing to say?

1310
02:48:24,682 --> 02:48:29,223
Not to be anxious.
l'm of the age when one leaves

1311
02:48:31,807 --> 02:48:36,389
l've had a wonderful life

1312
02:48:37,515 --> 02:48:41,431
Son, l have nothing to complain about

1313
02:48:42,224 --> 02:48:46,306
But now that l see Simran..

1314
02:48:47,182 --> 02:48:51,764
after years a desire
wells up in my heart.

1315
02:48:53,724 --> 02:48:57,723
l want to see Simran married

1316
02:48:59,307 --> 02:49:06,306
Before she marries, l wish l don't..
- How Can you talk of suCh things?

1317
02:49:07,640 --> 02:49:09,639
Listen son

1318
02:49:10,599 --> 02:49:15,431
The bride's palanquin has just got to
cross over from one house to another

1319
02:49:16,015 --> 02:49:22,681
Now that everyone is here,
what difference would it make if..

1320
02:49:23,099 --> 02:49:27,556
the wedding is pre-poned to tomorrow?
- Absolutely Correct!

1321
02:49:27,640 --> 02:49:31,056
The wedding happens tomorrow.
Yes Baldev? Right tomorrow

1322
02:49:31,140 --> 02:49:34,223
Yes Ma-ji. Tomorrow

1323
02:49:43,890 --> 02:49:46,473
We will haνe to take
Simran away on the sly

1324
02:49:48,224 --> 02:49:53,181
Nothing else is going to work.
Don't worry. l have it all worked out

1325
02:49:53,432 --> 02:49:57,806
We're taking the morning train out.
l'll wait for you at the station

1326
02:49:57,890 --> 02:50:00,306
Somehow or the other,
just get there with Simran

1327
02:50:00,390 --> 02:50:01,723
Whatever happens next, we'll see

1328
02:50:03,640 --> 02:50:05,264
Are you listening?

1329
02:50:06,724 --> 02:50:10,973
l know this isn't your way. You don't
want to take Simran away like this

1330
02:50:11,307 --> 02:50:15,098
But son, it's too late now.
lf you love her..

1331
02:50:15,182 --> 02:50:20,889
if you want to spend a lifetime
with her, you must elope. Understand?

1332
02:50:29,140 --> 02:50:33,681
Please Raj, take me away from here!
You don't know my Babuji!

1333
02:50:33,849 --> 02:50:39,764
We have to run from here. We must!
- l've come to take you as my bride.

1334
02:50:40,015 --> 02:50:45,181
l'll take you only when
your Babuji gives me your hand

1335
02:50:45,724 --> 02:50:48,348
What is to happen tomorrow,
l don't know

1336
02:50:52,432 --> 02:50:56,639
What l'm going to do tomorrow,
l don't know

1337
02:51:00,307 --> 02:51:03,264
But you must trust me

1338
02:51:06,849 --> 02:51:13,848
Whatever l do tomorrow,
is going to be for both of us

1339
02:51:19,724 --> 02:51:21,556
Do you love me?

1340
02:51:23,807 --> 02:51:25,514
Do you trust me?

1341
02:51:28,599 --> 02:51:34,473
Then it's just a matter of time
before the bride is carried away, no?

1342
02:51:42,974 --> 02:51:46,806
"Oh heart's love"

1343
02:51:49,599 --> 02:51:53,598
"Oh my love"

1344
02:51:59,390 --> 02:52:03,181
"l giνe you.."

1345
02:52:06,265 --> 02:52:11,223
"..to God to keep"

1346
02:52:30,099 --> 02:52:32,639
"So strange are the ways of the world"

1347
02:52:32,724 --> 02:52:35,473
"The heart is crazed, yet so helpless"

1348
02:52:35,890 --> 02:52:38,389
"What's left to be heard?
What's left to be said?"

1349
02:52:38,474 --> 02:52:42,014
"Just let it lie between us"

1350
02:52:45,599 --> 02:52:51,473
"The hide-n-seek is over.
l'm getting married"

1351
02:52:56,432 --> 02:53:01,639
"How l wish it doesn't kill you"

1352
02:53:01,724 --> 02:53:06,514
Simi, come down, quick! Time for
the ritual body-painting with henna

1353
02:53:20,265 --> 02:53:24,806
"Oh my love"

1354
02:53:25,599 --> 02:53:29,348
"Oh my Moon"

1355
02:53:30,057 --> 02:53:34,181
"You are my life.."

1356
02:53:34,849 --> 02:53:39,306
"my beloved"

1357
02:54:38,349 --> 02:54:42,514
l wanted to tell you

1358
02:54:45,682 --> 02:54:51,431
You were right. l failed to recognise

1359
02:54:53,265 --> 02:54:58,514
You enter my house,
and before my family..

1360
02:54:59,182 --> 02:55:02,306
..you play with my honour?

1361
02:55:03,557 --> 02:55:08,056
You have deceived me! You have
taken advantage of our trust!

1362
02:55:08,724 --> 02:55:11,806
You made a joke out of our cordiality?

1363
02:55:12,640 --> 02:55:15,889
How dare you haνe an
affair with Simran?

1364
02:55:16,099 --> 02:55:20,181
Did you imagine you'd marry Simran?
You aren't even worthy of yourself

1365
02:55:20,224 --> 02:55:22,264
How can you be worthy of Simran?

1366
02:55:23,265 --> 02:55:28,973
l was right about you.
Liars, wastrels like you never improνe

1367
02:55:29,140 --> 02:55:31,764
They only become worse

1368
02:55:31,849 --> 02:55:35,764
No Babuji! No!

1369
02:55:43,474 --> 02:55:48,389
Didn't l tell you to take me away?
No one Cares for our love!

1370
02:55:48,474 --> 02:55:54,723
Didn't l say, let's elope?
- No Simran, don't

1371
02:55:55,640 --> 02:55:57,973
You can only run from strangers

1372
02:55:59,599 --> 02:56:02,598
From the ones we call our
own where could we run away to?

1373
02:56:10,182 --> 02:56:15,139
Our elders are our parents

1374
02:56:17,057 --> 02:56:23,764
All our lives, they've brought
us up. They gave us so much love

1375
02:56:25,765 --> 02:56:29,014
About our lives, they can
deCide better than we can

1376
02:56:31,224 --> 02:56:37,056
We have no right to make them
sad for the sake of our happiness

1377
02:56:43,557 --> 02:56:51,181
Babuji is right.
l am a liar, a cheat

1378
02:56:54,390 --> 02:57:01,806
Even if l lied for your sake,
a lie is always a lie

1379
02:57:05,557 --> 02:57:11,723
Babuji is right.
l'm not worthy of you

1380
02:57:14,390 --> 02:57:18,639
And so what if l can
see nothing beyond you?

1381
02:57:20,765 --> 02:57:25,139
And so what if l can
remember no one but you?

1382
02:57:27,057 --> 02:57:31,306
Babuji is right. l'm a wastrel

1383
02:57:33,599 --> 02:57:36,639
How did l think of marrying you?

1384
02:57:39,349 --> 02:57:45,264
So what if this wastrel
loves you like a madman?

1385
02:57:52,932 --> 02:57:55,264
Love isn't everything, is it?

1386
02:57:58,724 --> 02:58:00,681
Babuji is right, Simran

1387
02:58:02,724 --> 02:58:04,389
Babuji is right

1388
02:58:11,640 --> 02:58:16,181
Here you are Babuji.
Take your daughter

1389
02:58:30,057 --> 02:58:33,514
l didn't come here to
break anyone's heart

1390
02:58:35,432 --> 02:58:37,598
l just wanted to win hearts

1391
02:58:41,015 --> 02:58:43,556
Maybe l fall short of expectations

1392
02:58:43,932 --> 02:58:46,389
Maybe that's why
l couldn't win you over

1393
02:58:49,432 --> 02:58:53,306
lf you think Kuljit
will make Simran happier..

1394
02:58:58,182 --> 02:58:59,973
then you're right

1395
02:59:02,307 --> 02:59:07,431
What's best for Simran, you know best

1396
02:59:11,682 --> 02:59:14,889
Forgive me

1397
03:00:13,349 --> 03:00:15,348
Forgive me Preeti

1398
03:00:16,974 --> 03:00:19,306
l know l have hurt you

1399
03:01:12,390 --> 03:01:17,431
Where's Simran, Raj?
Raj, where is Simran?

1400
03:01:18,557 --> 03:01:22,264
She will come, Pops. She'll come

1401
03:01:24,182 --> 03:01:26,723
Babuji will bring her. Personally

1402
03:01:27,182 --> 03:01:29,306
He will have to

1403
03:01:54,057 --> 03:01:58,306
l wish to hear no more.
Go away from here

1404
03:01:58,765 --> 03:02:02,889
Your son has deceived all of us.
He has shown us where he belongs

1405
03:02:03,349 --> 03:02:08,306
l won't let my daughter marry a liar!
- Enough!

1406
03:02:09,807 --> 03:02:14,139
l am proud of my son.
Don't incite me to passion

1407
03:03:31,182 --> 03:03:33,306
Kuljit and Raj are
fighting at the station

1408
03:03:33,432 --> 03:03:37,306
We must go there! One
might kill the other!

1409
03:03:37,640 --> 03:03:39,889
Come on

1410
03:03:48,015 --> 03:03:50,348
Come with me Simran

1411
03:04:43,265 --> 03:04:44,681
Stop

1412
03:06:22,099 --> 03:06:27,306
Let me go, Babuji! Please let me go

1413
03:06:27,765 --> 03:06:32,431
Raj means all my life!
Without him, l can't live

1414
03:06:33,015 --> 03:06:35,431
Let me go to my Raj

1415
03:06:35,890 --> 03:06:39,056
Please let me go to my Raj

1416
03:07:00,224 --> 03:07:02,181
Go Simran

1417
03:07:04,015 --> 03:07:09,639
No one can love you more than him

1418
03:07:10,265 --> 03:07:14,556
Go my child. Go to your Raj

1419
03:07:15,182 --> 03:07:18,931
Go on Simran. Live your life

1420
03:07:19,265 --> 03:07:21,306
Go my child, go

1421
03:08:22,057 --> 03:08:25,764
ln big places, such
small things happen

1422
03:08:29,349 --> 03:08:34,056
The loνer will carry his bride away
