1
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:03,346
May I leave now?

2
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:09,188
- Good bye!
- Bye.

3
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:14,204
Definite, come here.

4
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:28,799
He just left!

5
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:31,661
Fill up the tank.

6
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:08,584
Let's go...

7
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:27,547
Hey, Faizal...

8
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,116
Someone just shot your father.

9
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:33,789
Someone shot your dad.

10
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:56,534
Danish... wait, son.

11
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:00,045
- Get inside, mom!
- I want to come.

12
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:01,773
You should stay home.

13
00:04:02,182 --> 00:04:04,208
Nothing will happen to dad.
Shama, take her inside.

14
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:07,050
Let me go with you, son.

15
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,588
Were'nt you supposed to
be with dad, fucker?

16
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:12,574
- I fell asleep.
- Fell asleep? Fell asleep?

17
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:13,901
Asshole!

18
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:17,238
You're always lying stoned
on Fazlu's terrace.

19
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:21,442
Like you're always lying
on top of your wife!

20
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:24,014
Enough!

21
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:25,219
Hurry up!

22
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:32,233
We were having tea...

23
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:34,999
when Mr. Sardar Khan's car drove in.

24
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:37,484
We recognized him as
he comes here often.

25
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:43,527
Suddenly there was loud firing
and a few guys on motorcycles...

26
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:44,855
Father!

27
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,102
Who killed him?

28
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,504
Who the fuck killed my father?

29
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:53,404
Sir, they have arrested one
of the shooters.

30
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:57,515
Get out, son of a bitch!

31
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:00,062
Get out!

32
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:02,200
- Look, you can't...
- Stay back.

33
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:05,226
Who else was with you?

34
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:16,319
I said stand back!

35
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:18,344
I said stand back motherfucker!

36
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:22,193
Rip the fucker a new hole!

37
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:25,078
Speak, bastard!
Speak.

38
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,144
He just left!

39
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:37,518
Hey, Faizal...

40
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:40,063
lets take father's body home.

41
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:43,135
But... we're in the midst of
an investigation...

42
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:44,240
Shut the fuck up!

43
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:48,117
This is my father's corpse,
and it will go straight home.

44
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,620
So fuck your investigation.

45
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:53,989
Understood?

46
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,298
Come on, lift him...

47
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:14,471
Wonderful news, Mr. Singh!

48
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:20,249
Our officers can finally breathe
easy after 12 years.

49
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:23,585
Not for long, I'm afraid.

50
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:27,980
Sardar Khan's gone,
but he's left behind 4 sons.

51
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,322
- Five.
- Sorry?

52
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:33,700
Five.

53
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,147
Four from the first wife,
and one from the second.

54
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:40,788
The second one's a cook
at my place.

55
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:45,623
Meet Sardar Khan's fifth.

56
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:47,026
What's your name?

57
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:49,132
- Definite.
- Why "Definite"?

58
00:08:49,302 --> 00:08:51,827
Because I have a definite
mission in life.

59
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:54,130
Which is?

60
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:55,538
Sardar Khan's death.

61
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:57,876
But he's already dead.

62
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:02,628
- How many rotis are ready?
- About 8.

63
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:05,873
Hurry up... they're waiting.

64
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:08,107
I'll serve some curry till then.

65
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:21,515
How can you all eat in peace?

66
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:51,518
Even I belong to
brother Sultan's family.

67
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:53,463
You are now my family.

68
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:55,991
And my parents?

69
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,896
They are my parents too.

70
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:03,066
But what about what your
mom just said?

71
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:13,539
You're just pissed that someone else
bumped off your old man, not you.

72
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:16,343
Brother Saggir's call for you...

73
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:18,070
Yes, coming mom...

74
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:24,174
Go to hell, loser!

75
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,024
You have to stay alert all the time.

76
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:36,810
Fazlu doped you with weed and
informed Sultan that dad was riding alone.

77
00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:41,055
Sultan was there himself,
with Saggir and another guy.

78
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,759
And like a dumbass you kept
hanging with your 'buddy'!

79
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,689
Wanna play with a two-face,
better leam to carry a mask.

80
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,736
Tomorrow morning, at the shopping centre.

81
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:56,232
Let me know if you can't do this, Faizal.

82
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:08,064
Sit.

83
00:11:23,706 --> 00:11:24,536
He's not here.

84
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:27,883
But Faizal had said he'd
be here by 11 A.M.

85
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:29,741
What time is it?

86
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:05,541
Come on...
let's leave, son.

87
00:12:09,414 --> 00:12:10,745
Now what are you doing?

88
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,093
Stay away from long haired girls at school.

89
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:23,783
Look at this fat lice.

90
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,381
Go to your room, boys.

91
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:40,973
Where is Shama?

92
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:58,563
- May I ask something?
- Yes.

93
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:04,050
Can't you leave this blood shed
and look after the family?

94
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,286
Begging for your brother's life, eh?

95
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,580
No... yours.

96
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,290
Look here Shama Parveen,
don't you ever interfere in my work.

97
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:41,491
Understood?

98
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:03,103
DHANBAD POLICE STATION

99
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,824
I surrender...
for stealing wood.

100
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:23,942
Easy there, buddy!

101
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:29,213
There are cops here.

102
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:30,455
Fuck them.

103
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:34,988
Yes, I was angry and
had threatened to kill him...

104
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:38,375
but I wasn't even at the
shopping centre that morning.

105
00:14:38,913 --> 00:14:40,505
Why did you surrender then?

106
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,447
I had stopped and unloaded
wood from a train.

107
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:49,154
When I learnt that it's illegal
I decided to surrender myself.

108
00:14:49,997 --> 00:14:51,828
Do you have any other witnesses?

109
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,262
No, your honour.

110
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,298
You are released with a fine of Rs.500.

111
00:14:58,406 --> 00:14:59,856
Non-payment will lead to...

112
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:03,285
15 days imprisonment.

113
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:31,005
Run... run, motherfuckers!

114
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:08,771
He's completely incapable.

115
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:12,758
Drugs have made him useless.

116
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:16,062
The pain of losing one so young...

117
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:20,067
and Danish was my first-born.

118
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:23,802
Calm down...
I understand your...

119
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:29,575
Faizal...

120
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:32,114
when will your blood boil, son?

121
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:35,767
Your father paid for your
drugs with his life.

122
00:18:36,341 --> 00:18:38,810
Now your brother has paid the
price for your recklessness.

123
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:40,937
So when will you pull
the trigger, boy?

124
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:47,513
When will you leave those potheads and
avenge your father and brother?

125
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:53,246
Look at your eyes...
dead with drugs.

126
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,792
Enough, Nagma...

127
00:18:56,793 --> 00:19:00,651
If those filthy hands can only eat,
then let me feed you, fucker!

128
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:02,615
Now what are you staring at?

129
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:06,492
Where's that knife?

130
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,186
Stop it. Have you lost it?

131
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:11,622
Here... let me chop those
useless fingers.

132
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:14,265
- Enough, mother.
- I'll chop them.

133
00:19:17,104 --> 00:19:18,537
This is madness, Nagma!

134
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,771
Shut up!

135
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:22,536
You will stay out of this.

136
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:33,771
Father, grandfather, brother...
your son Faizal will avenge them all.

137
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:38,640
Don't cry, my old lady.

138
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:44,681
Staying stoned won't help you
forget Danish's death.

139
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,336
Who wants to forget, uncle?

140
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:02,507
It's been a month since we buried him.

141
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:03,917
I know that.

142
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:06,113
Then what are you doing about it?

143
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:10,424
Same as you...

144
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:13,017
counting days!

145
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:19,379
<i>Long live, Fazlu Ahmed!</i>

146
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,891
<i>Fazlu Ahmed...</i>

147
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:26,894
<i>Long live Wasseypur's new youth leader!</i>

148
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:53,569
Where are you going?

149
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:56,106
Fazlu has won the election today.

150
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:00,277
Take Asgar with you.

151
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:02,715
He's my friend.

152
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,823
I will congratulate him myself.

153
00:21:10,248 --> 00:21:11,652
Eat something, dear.

154
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:27,702
How long are you going
to blame yourself?

155
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:33,358
<i>- Long live brother Fazlu!
- Shut up, cunt.</i>

156
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:38,717
Fazlu...

157
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:43,524
Hey, Faizal...

158
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:47,951
my buddy's here.
Get out of the way.

159
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:50,926
Where've you been, buddy?

160
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:54,755
We're partying 'cos I won, man...
where have you been?

161
00:21:54,863 --> 00:21:56,909
Everone spits at me at home.

162
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:00,750
And people laugh at me outside...
the bastards.

163
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,924
Why?

164
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,698
Because the cunts feel that...

165
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:12,403
Faizal sacrificed his own
blood for friendship.

166
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:19,954
My old woman says if I wasn't born,
there'd be no mourning in Sardar Khan's home.

167
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:21,932
What do you mean?

168
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:25,629
I mean...
here, light the toke first.

169
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:44,757
This is some strong shit, dude.

170
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,906
What's with the look, man?

171
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:57,280
I used to think I'm the angry, young Hero
born in the villian's den...

172
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:01,483
but I turned out to be just
a silent side-kick.

173
00:23:02,822 --> 00:23:04,619
Someone else turned out
to be the Hero.

174
00:23:09,412 --> 00:23:10,506
Who?

175
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:12,531
You, son of a bitch!

176
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:14,689
I'm coming!

177
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:37,246
<i>She plays with rocks.
She flips and flops...</i>

178
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:41,113
<i>is made of dew drops.
And makes only holy stops!</i>

179
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:45,654
<i>Fazlu's death made Faizal a force to reckon with.</i>

180
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:50,011
<i>People were terrified of him after
the ruthless beheading.</i>

181
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:58,591
<i>All illegal iron traders were shit scared
and soon became his cronies.</i>

182
00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:04,217
<i>Not an ounce of iron could be cut or sold
without Faizal's consent.</i>

183
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:06,952
<i>Even the cops were in on it.</i>

184
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,975
<i>Every police station was on his pay roll...</i>

185
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:13,572
<i>and they happily turned a blind eye
to his illegal affairs.</i>

186
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:26,316
<i>His business finally became stable
when he set up a massive iron warehouse.</i>

187
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:15,645
<i>Take me...</i>

188
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:19,939
<i>Make me yours.</i>

189
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:25,234
<i>It is time...</i>

190
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:29,437
<i>make love to me.</i>

191
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,674
<i>Let me wear your body...</i>

192
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:42,590
<i>while you sprinkle your
honey love on me!</i>

193
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:46,127
Isn't this song a little... naughty?

194
00:26:52,118 --> 00:26:53,489
Like you.

195
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:55,417
Huh?

196
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:03,599
I want your...
permission for something.

197
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:05,162
What?

198
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:07,443
You won't mind, right?

199
00:27:07,483 --> 00:27:08,580
Nope.

200
00:27:11,787 --> 00:27:13,741
I want to have sex with you.

201
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:23,182
Should I beat you to
pulp with my shoe?

202
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:27,122
That's it. Get out.

203
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:29,857
- Get out!
- But you said you won't mind.

204
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:30,862
Yeah, right!

205
00:27:31,268 --> 00:27:32,235
Get out now.

206
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:35,336
I'll wake up everyone
with one scream.

207
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:43,697
- "Lover gets the Bride".
- Seen it 4 times.

208
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:46,097
- "Who am I to you"?
- That film's out.

209
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:48,237
- "Bollywood Dreams"?
- Seen it.

210
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:49,534
"Karan Arjun"?

211
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:53,003
Come on...
let's see that film.

212
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:55,248
It's got both Shahrukh and
Salman.

213
00:27:55,485 --> 00:27:57,049
No, you'll hold my hand.

214
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,617
- I won't.
- You will.

215
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:01,250
I swear on my mom, I won't.

216
00:28:01,487 --> 00:28:03,107
And you won't fondle my cheeks?

217
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,016
I swear on mom, I won't.

218
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,751
And you won't grope my lap
to "look for popcorn"?

219
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:10,257
- I swear on mom, I won't.
- You won't?

220
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:15,460
- Wiill you stick to me?
- I swear on mom, I won't.

221
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:18,594
Why don't you just watch it with
your mom then, loser.

222
00:28:20,172 --> 00:28:21,269
Give me a pencil two.

223
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:29,031
Don't go alone.
What if you're attacked from behind?

224
00:28:29,904 --> 00:28:30,995
Listen, old woman...

225
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:34,811
in this line of work
one can't trust 2 things.

226
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,018
One, the fear born from
your own heart.

227
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,183
And second... partnership!

228
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:45,719
Death is certain. If Allah doesn't kill me,
this neighbourhood will.

229
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:46,996
God forbid!

230
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:49,329
Fazlu left me fatherless...

231
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:53,457
when I trusted him more
than myself.

232
00:28:54,327 --> 00:28:55,554
So what's the point!

233
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,343
This button unloads the entire magazine.

234
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,773
I want 15 of these.

235
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:09,979
And 12 of this.

236
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,844
Anything else?

237
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:14,768
Boss wants only this many.

238
00:29:17,946 --> 00:29:19,042
What's that?

239
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:20,838
Pager.

240
00:29:21,816 --> 00:29:22,786
What does it do?

241
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:24,486
You send messages through it.

242
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:29,892
You tell them your message and
they send it for you.

243
00:29:30,264 --> 00:29:31,753
Message to whom?

244
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:34,831
To whoever you have
work with.

245
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,146
But who sends it?

246
00:29:36,714 --> 00:29:38,062
Whoever has work.

247
00:29:38,198 --> 00:29:39,425
Yeah, but who sends it?

248
00:29:39,565 --> 00:29:41,830
Anyone can...
your family or your friends.

249
00:29:44,738 --> 00:29:48,271
<i>So very dark...</i>

250
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,574
<i>My lover is so dark...</i>

251
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:56,811
<i>His skin is dark...
but his heart is darker.</i>

252
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,385
<i>Dark abuses fall from his
black tongue...</i>

253
00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:05,711
<i>Grey days become dark evenings...</i>

254
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:10,817
<i>For my lover is a coal criminal.</i>

255
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:18,864
<i>So very dark...</i>

256
00:30:19,073 --> 00:30:21,371
<i>My lover is so dark.</i>

257
00:30:23,511 --> 00:30:27,303
<i>Dark skin...
with a darker heart.</i>

258
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,844
<i>And black cusses fall from
his black tongue.</i>

259
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:36,149
<i>Grey days become dark evenings...</i>

260
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:41,584
<i>For my lover is a coal criminal.</i>

261
00:30:45,265 --> 00:30:49,059
<i>He will find the damn coal...</i>

262
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:53,389
<i>and steal the damn coal.</i>

263
00:30:54,096 --> 00:30:58,328
<i>He will find the damn coal,
and steal the damn coal.</i>

264
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:02,632
<i>He won't stoke the kitchen fires...</i>

265
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:13,700
<i>But he sure knows how to
steal that coal.</i>

266
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:29,364
<i>My lover is a wicked, wicked thief.</i>

267
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:14,992
<i>The soil is dark,
the dog is blacker.</i>

268
00:32:16,872 --> 00:32:19,676
<i>Black as the kohl in my eyes.</i>

269
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:24,285
<i>He's black as a raven...</i>

270
00:32:25,673 --> 00:32:28,468
<i>he's darker than fear.</i>

271
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:46,396
Merely holding
a gun doesn't make you a Don.

272
00:32:47,804 --> 00:32:50,755
Killing Sultan and Ramadhir Singh
is no child's play.

273
00:32:51,157 --> 00:32:53,215
To do that you need guts.

274
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,501
And how many has Faizal
killled anyway?

275
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:58,865
Just Fazlu...

276
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:02,968
that too by conning him
with friendship.

277
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:09,149
For now people seem afraid,
but that fear will soon evaporate.

278
00:33:09,658 --> 00:33:13,052
What say, brother...
Am I wrong?

279
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:14,641
Check this out.

280
00:33:14,813 --> 00:33:17,873
Brother, any clue what day of the
week it is today?

281
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:29,593
<i>Such a wicked thief.</i>

282
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:33,369
<i>Such a wicked, wicked thief.</i>

283
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,223
<i>Such a crazy coal thief.</i>

284
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:43,797
<i>Dark as sin...</i>

285
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:46,876
<i>that's my lover.</i>

286
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:51,387
I've sworn on my mother...

287
00:33:52,122 --> 00:33:54,716
that I'll lay your corpse
at her feet.

288
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,452
Why on earth?

289
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,824
Because you killed my father.

290
00:34:03,055 --> 00:34:06,650
See, if I hadn't killed your father
he would've killed me.

291
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:09,350
But you also killed his father.

292
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:10,657
True.

293
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:15,768
He wanted to kill me too.
See, that's how the story began.

294
00:34:16,707 --> 00:34:17,667
Look, Faizal...

295
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:24,183
I have nothing against you,
your father or your brother.

296
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:28,740
I killled them so I could live.

297
00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:33,305
Tell me, who wants to die needlessly?

298
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:41,053
So what do you want?

299
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:43,664
I won't come in your way.

300
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,691
You rule Wasseypur.

301
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:50,120
Do as you please.
Make your millions.

302
00:34:51,097 --> 00:34:53,429
Dhanbad authorities will
back you.

303
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:59,605
And if my men flout this agreement,
feel free to shoot me.

304
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:04,045
But if you slip up...

305
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:08,610
then I will act appropriately.
You shouldn't mind then.

306
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:12,249
So your dad's merrily
joined hands with them...

307
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,982
and expects us to
get amnesia.

308
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,414
That bastard chopped up Fazlu
and we should forget it?

309
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:26,163
But you killed his brother
and father... didn't you?

310
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:31,173
Now father has decided that
no one will touch Faizal.

311
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:33,801
What if he attacks us?

312
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:36,963
Then handle it...
but don't involve us.

313
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:45,106
<i>Black clouds loom,
there will be black rain.</i>

314
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:49,338
<i>His black flags rebel...
against the dark winds.</i>

315
00:35:49,683 --> 00:35:53,749
<i>But the money in his black purse
is as guilty as his eyes.</i>

316
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,019
<i>The inglorious smoke from
his black flames...</i>

317
00:35:58,331 --> 00:36:02,478
<i>The black sun rules with
its iron heat.</i>

318
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:06,855
<i>The lamp, the elephant, and all...
is black... pitch black.</i>

319
00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:09,857
<i>God damn that coal...</i>

320
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:14,860
<i>he will steal the damn coal.</i>

321
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:19,944
<i>If there is coal,
he will find it and steal it...</i>

322
00:36:20,185 --> 00:36:24,280
<i>for that's all his black heart
gives a shit about.</i>

323
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:42,595
<i>He's the thief of my heart.</i>

324
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,152
Have you crapped as well?

325
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:53,331
Where's Khalid?

326
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:03,568
<i>Khalid was Sultan's main henchman.</i>

327
00:37:03,812 --> 00:37:09,623
<i>And the only one of Sardar's killers
whose whereabouts were unknown.</i>

328
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:13,407
How much does he pay you?

329
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,248
Dried bones and bread.

330
00:37:17,923 --> 00:37:21,521
If you join me you'll get a whole
goat every month.

331
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:24,626
Now where do I shoot you...
in the ass?

332
00:37:26,868 --> 00:37:27,993
In the intestines?

333
00:37:29,236 --> 00:37:30,204
Or...

334
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,539
- shall I let you go?
- Let me go.

335
00:37:34,782 --> 00:37:36,009
- What?
- Let me go.

336
00:37:36,513 --> 00:37:37,728
Okay, then.

337
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:41,095
From now you'll shadow
Khalid for me.

338
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,906
And if you tr to decieve me
I'll bury you wherever you're standing.

339
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,341
See, I smoke pot, hash...

340
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:52,450
I've even murdered Fazlu
and a few others.

341
00:37:53,956 --> 00:37:55,394
Done some jail time too.

342
00:37:58,437 --> 00:38:00,402
So you want to tell me
about your stuff?

343
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:22,222
<i>Like a wire...</i>

344
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:24,650
<i>As thin as a wire...</i>

345
00:38:25,248 --> 00:38:34,282
<i>My darling's as thin as a wire...</i>

346
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:39,651
<i>What in God's name have you done
to him, ma-in-law?</i>

347
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:46,501
<i>My darling's shrunken like
a dried prune...</i>

348
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:52,026
<i>He's like a dried prune...</i>

349
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:57,072
<i>Poor darling...
my poor dear.</i>

350
00:38:57,373 --> 00:39:00,042
<i>Just doesn't eat...</i>

351
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:07,079
<i>My darling doesn't eat a thing...</i>

352
00:39:11,734 --> 00:39:20,785
<i>What in God's name have you done
to him, ma-in-law?</i>

353
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:35,774
<i>My darling's as thin as a wire...</i>

354
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:55,729
<i>My darling walks in dark caves...</i>

355
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:02,260
<i>My darling walks in dark caves...</i>

356
00:40:02,427 --> 00:40:07,127
<i>His life's a dark mine,
swiftly filling with water...</i>

357
00:40:07,233 --> 00:40:11,499
<i>Where have you led the poor
workers, our leader?</i>

358
00:40:11,837 --> 00:40:16,506
<i>Where have you led the people,
great leader?</i>

359
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:21,048
<i>Was this the Worker's movement,
dear leader?</i>

360
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:25,901
<i>Was this the flame you lit,
people's leader?</i>

361
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:30,947
<i>At the rate of coal...</i>

362
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:36,152
<i>Sold at the rate of coal...</i>

363
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:41,230
<i>Sold at the rate of coal,
everday my dear.</i>

364
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:45,508
<i>My darling, my dear...
My Bihar!</i>

365
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:55,067
<i>Fountains of lament burst through
mountains of sadness...</i>

366
00:40:55,475 --> 00:41:04,321
<i>Fountains of lament, my dear...</i>

367
00:41:04,857 --> 00:41:08,850
<i>My darling is as thin as a wire.</i>

368
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:28,871
with a deposit of 11,021 rupees...

369
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:35,314
and these people as yourwitness,
do you take Mohsina as your wife?

370
00:41:35,753 --> 00:41:36,644
I do.

371
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:47,577
Do you grant Faizal Khan
permission to marry you?

372
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:49,218
I permit him.

373
00:41:49,223 --> 00:41:50,212
Say, "I do".

374
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,054
I do!

375
00:41:55,435 --> 00:41:58,131
Congratulations, dear!

376
00:41:58,155 --> 00:42:01,143
Faizal...

377
00:42:12,378 --> 00:42:13,572
What broke?

378
00:42:14,647 --> 00:42:17,915
Either sleep or
lay the mattress on the floor.

379
00:43:24,472 --> 00:43:27,305
Some guy's here with
news of Khalid.

380
00:43:29,243 --> 00:43:30,404
Where's my gun?

381
00:43:30,612 --> 00:43:32,045
In your pants!

382
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:33,943
Shut up!

383
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:36,869
But where are you going?

384
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:44,312
so wash colored and whites seperately...

385
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:47,626
but only if they're cotton.
Georgettes can be mixed.

386
00:43:48,228 --> 00:43:49,187
Salaam, mother!

387
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:54,631
Ironing marks are visible here.

388
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:58,069
And does this look
white to you?

389
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:04,425
Faizal?

390
00:44:08,037 --> 00:44:10,505
Our enemy is standing
in our porch...

391
00:44:10,973 --> 00:44:12,537
this doesn't seem right to me.

392
00:44:13,148 --> 00:44:15,548
Please take care of the house,
my mother...

393
00:44:16,118 --> 00:44:17,847
and let me handle the
business.

394
00:44:18,954 --> 00:44:20,922
But he's a close aide of Khalid's.

395
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,390
He used to be...
now he's my aide.

396
00:44:25,056 --> 00:44:26,448
Now please look after the house.

397
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:40,965
Where's Khalid?

398
00:44:40,975 --> 00:44:43,136
He's eating breakfast alone
at the crossing.

399
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:47,206
His family is on a pilgrimage,
so he eats out often.

400
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:49,827
No one will follow me.

401
00:44:51,575 --> 00:44:53,543
But if I don't return,
kill him.

402
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,053
Come on, step out.

403
00:45:07,395 --> 00:45:08,954
Everyone out.
Come on...

404
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:14,249
What's up, asshole!

405
00:45:16,194 --> 00:45:18,787
- Forgive me, brother.
- Shave his head.

406
00:45:19,731 --> 00:45:20,555
Hey, wait!

407
00:45:20,565 --> 00:45:21,862
I'll get you Sultan.

408
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:24,258
I can get him myself asshole.

409
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:26,913
We're both Muslims, brother.

410
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:30,141
- Even Allah forgives once...
- Move that razor, man.

411
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,748
Wear these.

412
00:45:50,928 --> 00:45:52,731
- Please forgive me...
- Wear these.

413
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,730
Check out Dr. Evil!

414
00:46:06,404 --> 00:46:10,738
He shaved and shot him,
should we keep jerking off?

415
00:46:11,744 --> 00:46:12,735
What?

416
00:46:13,045 --> 00:46:15,174
Just talk to your dad, dammit!

417
00:46:17,059 --> 00:46:19,186
It's a tender for a new highway...

418
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:23,762
from the city of Patna to Kolkatta,
over the river Ganges.

419
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:24,852
Father.

420
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:27,912
Sultan called.

421
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:32,128
Go and arrange tea and snacks.

422
00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:37,130
What is this?
Musical chairs? Get out.

423
00:46:38,703 --> 00:46:39,864
Get out!

424
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:42,709
Father...

425
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:48,341
I've told you many times...
don't name thugs in polite company.

426
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:52,700
Thing is that Faizal has just shot the guy
who killed Sardar Khan.

427
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,410
So what's the problem?

428
00:46:54,547 --> 00:46:57,606
- But he was our man.
- He was Sultan's.

429
00:46:58,017 --> 00:46:59,951
And Sultan is not our
man either.

430
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:01,751
- But isn't he working for...
- Shut up!

431
00:47:02,021 --> 00:47:04,420
and shove your sentiments in your arse.

432
00:47:06,096 --> 00:47:09,435
Stop playing silly games
with petty politicians here...

433
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:12,827
why don't you go to your constituency
and motivate your voters instead?

434
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:16,220
- And where were you last night?
- I was watching a movie.

435
00:47:17,263 --> 00:47:18,233
Which movie?

436
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,428
"The lover gets the bride".

437
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:26,902
Son... you're simply not upto this.

438
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:31,279
You're worrying me now.
I don't think this job is for you.

439
00:47:58,048 --> 00:48:00,475
Give him the goat...

440
00:48:01,668 --> 00:48:03,101
and let him go.

441
00:48:49,943 --> 00:48:54,976
<i>Babu Khan a.k.a. Babua a.k.a. Perpendicular!</i>

442
00:48:55,016 --> 00:49:00,052
<i>The youngest brother, merely 14...
but crime was child's play for him.</i>

443
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,556
See this blade?

444
00:49:03,296 --> 00:49:05,490
Nothing will happen if you
use it sideways.

445
00:49:06,466 --> 00:49:10,902
So always hold it like this
and use it perpendicularly.

446
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:13,524
- Do you know "perpendicular"?
- Yup.

447
00:49:13,729 --> 00:49:14,723
What?

448
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:19,563
Like I'm perpendicular to this iron slab.

449
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:25,007
A dead body means the blade must
have cut it perpendicularly.

450
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,979
But a mere slit in the skin means
it was a tangential cut.

451
00:49:29,851 --> 00:49:31,012
Here.

452
00:49:31,852 --> 00:49:33,581
Practice and report.

453
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:41,586
<i>Perpendicular was more terrifying than Faizal.</i>

454
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,884
<i>A 14 year old who literally played
with a blade in his mouth.</i>

455
00:49:46,928 --> 00:49:50,995
<i>Who simply knew:
Blade + skin = blood!</i>

456
00:49:56,143 --> 00:49:58,542
I hit perpendicular, he hit at a tangent.

457
00:50:02,705 --> 00:50:06,368
<i>He had many run-ins with cops,
but always escaped.</i>

458
00:50:09,712 --> 00:50:11,612
Bullets were whizzing past me...

459
00:50:12,347 --> 00:50:14,117
one even grazed my ear...

460
00:50:14,757 --> 00:50:15,853
ka-pow!

461
00:50:15,991 --> 00:50:18,015
But they couldn't catch me!

462
00:50:27,795 --> 00:50:32,028
<i>It was impossible to get evidence or a witness
against Faizal's brother.</i>

463
00:50:32,534 --> 00:50:33,557
It wasn't him.

464
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:35,965
<i>And he always got away scott free.</i>

465
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:45,717
<i>That's Tangent.</i>

466
00:50:46,454 --> 00:50:50,635
<i>Tangent did everything
with Perpendicular...</i>

467
00:50:50,975 --> 00:50:55,645
<i>but was the first to flee
in the face of danger.</i>

468
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,788
Hi, I'm Perpendicular.

469
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,259
Faizal Khan is my elder bro.
I've come to rob your shop.

470
00:51:07,103 --> 00:51:09,367
So please don't call the cops,
or we'll shoot you.

471
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,828
Are you done, uncle?
Go on then.

472
00:51:15,298 --> 00:51:16,323
Open everthing.

473
00:51:18,007 --> 00:51:21,534
We should mask up now,
or they'll identify us.

474
00:51:26,114 --> 00:51:27,343
Here... give me the keys.

475
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,087
Open it... quickly!

476
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,277
Those are my slippers.

477
00:51:44,762 --> 00:51:47,094
Hide this in my room.
Ciao!

478
00:51:59,779 --> 00:52:02,098
<i>Perpendicular got caught again.
And the jeweller said...</i>

479
00:52:04,304 --> 00:52:05,205
It wasn't him.

480
00:52:06,413 --> 00:52:07,849
<i>Perpendicular was released.</i>

481
00:52:17,526 --> 00:52:18,595
Hey, Babua!

482
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:21,192
- What now?
- Come here.

483
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,027
What's this I hear?

484
00:52:26,992 --> 00:52:31,867
I think you accidentally took my keys
with the other stuff.

485
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,035
If I could get the keys
back please...

486
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:36,000
What were you shopping for?

487
00:52:38,576 --> 00:52:41,136
He's just a kid.
Mistakes happen.

488
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:05,692
So beautiful.

489
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:07,027
Isn't it?

490
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:16,958
Please send the receipt to Faizal's office.

491
00:53:17,636 --> 00:53:18,732
Babua...

492
00:53:20,106 --> 00:53:21,073
Babua...

493
00:53:26,117 --> 00:53:26,976
Hello!

494
00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:28,079
What's up, buddy!

495
00:53:29,054 --> 00:53:30,013
What's up?

496
00:53:30,089 --> 00:53:31,779
Wanna make 5 grand?

497
00:53:31,824 --> 00:53:34,297
<i>A new era of change had rung in.</i>

498
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:39,184
<i>There wasn't just one Ramadhir Singh
or Sardar Khan anymore...</i>

499
00:53:39,453 --> 00:53:42,355
<i>now any Tom, Dick or wanted
to be Sardar Khan or Sultan.</i>

500
00:53:44,492 --> 00:53:45,359
<i>Definite.</i>

501
00:53:56,848 --> 00:53:59,817
<i>His mother had handed him
a pistol at a tender age.</i>

502
00:54:00,182 --> 00:54:02,163
Where's the matchbox
you stole from me?

503
00:54:02,342 --> 00:54:05,675
The world would be in flames
by now if I really had it.

504
00:54:06,279 --> 00:54:08,577
Don't fight with anyone today.

505
00:54:09,149 --> 00:54:12,612
<i>Ever guy thought he was the
studly Hero of his neighbourhood.</i>

506
00:54:12,725 --> 00:54:15,284
<i>But Definite also had the dual blood
of Durga and Sardar Khan.</i>

507
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,561
<i>They are just good friends!</i>

508
00:54:17,763 --> 00:54:22,224
<i>Can a young guy and girl
be just friends?</i>

509
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,420
<i>Here... another cliched friendship!</i>

510
00:54:26,528 --> 00:54:29,190
<i>Definite and Perpendicular
were from the same bloodline.</i>

511
00:54:29,264 --> 00:54:31,425
<i>While new thugs were
mushrooming daily...</i>

512
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:33,557
<i>Definite was the deadliest!</i>

513
00:54:34,503 --> 00:54:36,938
<i>A boy and girl can never be friends.</i>

514
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:43,350
<i>This is just to hide hot flames of desire
inside throbbing hearts on those chilly nights.</i>

515
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:50,409
But I'm your friend!

516
00:54:51,285 --> 00:54:53,343
<i>A boy and girl can never be friends.</i>

517
00:54:53,687 --> 00:54:55,655
Isn't this that villian's dialogue?

518
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:56,822
Yeah, so?

519
00:55:00,394 --> 00:55:02,425
While you're busy killing
stray dogs and kittens...

520
00:55:02,902 --> 00:55:05,633
Faizal is gobbling up your
father's wealth.

521
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:07,900
I don't want a thing from
that fucker.

522
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:10,003
I just want Dhanbad!

523
00:55:16,906 --> 00:55:17,803
Which snake is this?

524
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:20,800
It's a cobra!

525
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,068
How do you hold it?

526
00:55:22,443 --> 00:55:23,468
Snake Cobra!

527
00:55:31,063 --> 00:55:33,292
- Come to Papa!
- Hey!

528
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:37,246
He's your brother after all.
Always a problem kid.

529
00:55:38,258 --> 00:55:42,992
That Hindu woman killed last Ramzan
was his handiwork.

530
00:55:44,032 --> 00:55:47,126
Apparently he loved her daughter.

531
00:55:47,702 --> 00:55:51,332
They would screw around anywhere...
the terrace, the yard...

532
00:55:51,946 --> 00:55:55,609
When her mom found out she promptly sent
the girl to her brother's in Calcutta.

533
00:55:56,083 --> 00:56:00,238
This made Definite threaten her,
"Call her back or I'll kill you!"

534
00:56:01,105 --> 00:56:03,041
Her mother threw him out
of the house.

535
00:56:03,177 --> 00:56:06,239
He lost it and bashed her
head in with a rod.

536
00:56:07,183 --> 00:56:09,481
How about making me a
splendid <i>paan</i>, uncle!

537
00:56:09,886 --> 00:56:12,285
Make it with love or
I'll put my friend in your pants.

538
00:56:12,522 --> 00:56:14,046
As you say, sir.

539
00:56:14,357 --> 00:56:15,520
Don't make me wait.

540
00:56:18,238 --> 00:56:20,729
Hey Definite, people are
looking for you.

541
00:56:21,341 --> 00:56:24,389
- Who's issued my warrant?
- Brother Faizal, hurry.

542
00:56:25,128 --> 00:56:26,754
Give me that <i>paan</i>... quick.

543
00:56:28,637 --> 00:56:32,004
Do you know what this 'warrant' means?
My time has begun.

544
00:56:36,511 --> 00:56:37,910
Salaam, uncle!

545
00:56:40,749 --> 00:56:41,846
Salaam, brother!

546
00:56:43,056 --> 00:56:44,019
Do that again.

547
00:56:44,092 --> 00:56:44,983
Salaam-wallekum!

548
00:56:45,092 --> 00:56:46,257
No, do that again.

549
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,219
Salaam-wallekum!

550
00:56:47,259 --> 00:56:49,044
Do the muffler move again.

551
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:50,139
Oh, this!

552
00:56:58,261 --> 00:56:59,251
Is it dead?

553
00:56:59,762 --> 00:57:01,287
No, it's alive...

554
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:04,926
Why did you steal it?

555
00:57:05,306 --> 00:57:06,402
Just like that.

556
00:57:06,879 --> 00:57:07,869
It looked sexy.

557
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:08,945
Sexy?

558
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:10,410
Yeah.

559
00:57:11,844 --> 00:57:12,766
Return it.

560
00:57:21,217 --> 00:57:24,209
- Brother, even I wanted to talk to you...
- Later!

561
00:57:26,722 --> 00:57:29,282
This shit shouldn't happen again.
Lets go, Mohsina.

562
00:57:37,224 --> 00:57:38,382
So what do I have to do?

563
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,920
It's 10 feet...
I've measured it.

564
00:57:43,464 --> 00:57:46,061
So you can actually fly
the bike across?

565
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:49,168
You think I've randomly
come up with the bet?

566
00:57:49,707 --> 00:57:51,698
- Have you done it before?
- Many times.

567
00:57:58,492 --> 00:58:00,575
If I crush a goat,
I'll eat it.

568
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:05,615
You can shove the hooves up your ass too.
First decide who goes first.

569
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:08,749
Let's toss a coin.

570
00:58:18,067 --> 00:58:19,534
- Choose.
- Heads.

571
00:58:21,337 --> 00:58:22,401
I win.

572
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:25,357
Hey, it's my coin.

573
00:58:26,931 --> 00:58:27,921
You go first.

574
00:58:28,734 --> 00:58:30,031
But I have another condition.

575
00:58:31,102 --> 00:58:34,476
- You can't copy my technique.
- Yeah, whatever.

576
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:38,481
- "Technique"!
- I'll show you, fucking lisp.

577
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:41,976
Sister fucker!

578
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:49,243
- What's he doing?
- What's he upto?

579
00:58:49,289 --> 00:58:52,051
He's an expert at this.

580
00:58:52,623 --> 00:58:56,582
He'll go over the planks at a speed of 80,
and fly across the hill.

581
00:58:57,627 --> 00:58:59,528
Do you have a game plan?

582
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:01,571
Wait...

583
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:05,172
- What?
- I won the toss, right?

584
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,501
Yes.

585
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,436
I've changed my mind.
I'll go first.

586
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:11,339
That's not cool, man!

587
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:14,502
Whatever Perpendicular
does is cool.

588
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:19,742
You're openly cheating because
you're Faizal's brother.

589
00:59:21,914 --> 00:59:23,247
Why drag brother into this?

590
00:59:24,056 --> 00:59:25,580
Give me the keys.
Come on!

591
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:28,423
Take it, asshole.

592
00:59:30,462 --> 00:59:31,520
Leave the money.

593
00:59:31,862 --> 00:59:33,490
What a fucking beggar!

594
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,625
Hold this.

595
00:59:37,728 --> 00:59:38,696
Which key is it?

596
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,251
Motherfucking asshole!

597
01:00:12,759 --> 01:00:15,859
Sister fucker tricked me.
I'll kick your ass.

598
01:00:20,806 --> 01:00:24,097
- That's not nice, brother...
- Love being a wise ass, don't you?

599
01:00:25,397 --> 01:00:30,671
I respect you a lot 'cos you're my brother
and you're fearless!

600
01:00:31,643 --> 01:00:36,137
But you should also respect me,
'cos I'm not even afraid of you!

601
01:00:44,195 --> 01:00:45,059
Sit.

602
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:48,754
<i>And thus began Definite's story.</i>

603
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:51,080
<i>He always wanted to be the Don.</i>

604
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:56,991
<i>Meanwhile, a new state had been carved
out of Bihar... Jharkhand.</i>

605
01:00:57,264 --> 01:01:03,262
<i>And all the mineral rich land including
Dhanbad became a part of this new state.</i>

606
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:08,809
<i>Now ever greedy officer and criminal
got a chance to rape the region.</i>

607
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:13,004
<i>Jharkhand was being robbed
in broad daylight by all.</i>

608
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:16,599
<i>Faizal's notoreity gave birth to
many small time criminals.</i>

609
01:01:16,945 --> 01:01:19,075
<i>Most significant amongst them was
Shamshad Aalam.</i>

610
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:23,079
<i>He used to be a cloth trader...</i>

611
01:01:23,489 --> 01:01:26,946
<i>who then got into transportation and
acquired many trucks.</i>

612
01:01:27,692 --> 01:01:31,066
<i>When he lost interest in that
he decided to get into iron.</i>

613
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:33,525
We'll get into iron trade.

614
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:37,229
You can't unless you share profits with Faizal.

615
01:01:37,297 --> 01:01:40,454
Fuck that! I hear one can't even
steal without his blessings.

616
01:01:40,794 --> 01:01:41,693
So now?

617
01:01:41,962 --> 01:01:44,096
He has one weakness...
Money!

618
01:01:44,804 --> 01:01:47,329
He's all guts but has zero
business sense.

619
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:50,138
The fucker sells to anyone
at any price.

620
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,343
He sells stock worth 5 bucks
at 2 bucks.

621
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:57,347
If we fix the market price with him,
he won't be able to resist a fat profit.

622
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:02,203
The guys you sell to aren't even traders,
they're middlemen.

623
01:02:03,078 --> 01:02:06,519
They buy from you at 2 bucks
and sell at 4.

624
01:02:07,053 --> 01:02:10,085
You're being ripped off.
Seriously!

625
01:02:10,663 --> 01:02:12,631
Bengalis don't care for iron anyway.

626
01:02:12,932 --> 01:02:16,368
The communist govemment over there
doesn't care about industry.

627
01:02:17,836 --> 01:02:23,338
Lets sell the iron to Gujarat and Orissa
directly and at higher rates.

628
01:02:24,013 --> 01:02:27,400
There's massive demand over there,
and you have ample supply.

629
01:02:28,003 --> 01:02:28,866
What say?

630
01:02:29,338 --> 01:02:31,203
Even my transportation is sorted.

631
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:36,206
I swear your meagre 2 bucks
will turn into 3.5 with me.

632
01:02:36,384 --> 01:02:37,278
Salaam, sister!

633
01:02:37,786 --> 01:02:40,450
And I'll keep what's left.
What say?

634
01:02:40,472 --> 01:02:43,879
honorable Dep. Chairman
of our Youth Society.

635
01:02:44,816 --> 01:02:48,762
And the honorable Chairman,
Mr.Faizal Khan.

636
01:02:50,638 --> 01:02:53,198
Please put your hands
together for him.

637
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:59,087
And the chairperson of the Ladies wing,
Ms. Mohsina Khan.

638
01:02:59,523 --> 01:03:03,687
<i>After making Faizal the Chairman
of a 2 day old society...</i>

639
01:03:03,827 --> 01:03:05,795
<i>Shamshad jump-started his career.</i>

640
01:03:06,897 --> 01:03:09,963
<i>Faizal handed over his father's
warehouse to him...</i>

641
01:03:10,106 --> 01:03:13,990
<i>and soon word spread that
Shamshad was Faizal's man.</i>

642
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,424
This used to be my father's.

643
01:03:17,129 --> 01:03:19,257
It's been lying idle since
brother passed away.

644
01:03:19,499 --> 01:03:24,066
<i>This promptly became a hot-bed for
money and tranny dance.</i>

645
01:04:35,668 --> 01:04:39,667
Why do you call mom 'old lady'?
Its not as if you look 30.

646
01:04:40,078 --> 01:04:41,670
I'd say you look like siblings.

647
01:04:41,847 --> 01:04:44,281
- Don't talk shit.
- It's a fact.

648
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:47,811
Have you seen your dark circles?
All thanks to weed.

649
01:04:47,944 --> 01:04:50,466
Do you think you look 24?

650
01:04:50,778 --> 01:04:52,574
Hey, don't get irritated.

651
01:04:52,713 --> 01:04:56,615
- I'm just saying that both of you look 40.
- Call back later!

652
01:04:58,052 --> 01:04:59,019
Let's go.

653
01:04:59,085 --> 01:05:01,783
Why'd you marry me if I look
like such a fossil?

654
01:05:02,127 --> 01:05:04,825
Don't get angry,
I'm just stating facts.

655
01:05:05,966 --> 01:05:08,832
Brother, can you guess his age?

656
01:05:09,636 --> 01:05:10,862
I'd say... 40.

657
01:05:11,035 --> 01:05:12,686
What?
How old am I?

658
01:05:14,196 --> 01:05:15,060
40?

659
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,966
- 35.
- Are you sure?

660
01:05:18,934 --> 01:05:19,924
24.

661
01:05:20,035 --> 01:05:22,003
Like I was born today, asshole!

662
01:05:22,138 --> 01:05:23,765
Happy Birthday, sir!

663
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:35,609
Babua, come here...

664
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:44,017
What is it?

665
01:05:45,427 --> 01:05:47,588
Go get this stuff from
the market.

666
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:51,228
- Mother, tea is also over.
- It's on the list.

667
01:05:53,975 --> 01:05:59,408
Quick! Hide the expensive stuff,
Perpendicular's coming.

668
01:06:01,698 --> 01:06:03,568
Pack everthing on the list.

669
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:05,801
Quickly!

670
01:06:12,248 --> 01:06:16,988
This one's out of stock,
can I give you another washing powder?

671
01:06:18,331 --> 01:06:19,923
How's it out of stock?

672
01:06:20,233 --> 01:06:21,598
It just is!

673
01:06:22,068 --> 01:06:25,349
Then give me the cash,
I'll buy it elsewhere.

674
01:06:25,989 --> 01:06:30,557
So he took your money and my stock,
and left without paying.

675
01:06:30,766 --> 01:06:34,702
That's nothing! These cheeky school brats
broke into my shop at night.

676
01:06:35,337 --> 01:06:39,034
Not only did they eat up all the sweets,
they woke me up and made me fry some more!

677
01:06:39,508 --> 01:06:42,002
When I told Faizal Khan about it,
he just laughed and said...

678
01:06:42,147 --> 01:06:45,551
...'He's just a kid!'
and handed me a measly 100 bucks!

679
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:49,267
That pint-sized devil's
made our life hell.

680
01:06:49,907 --> 01:06:53,781
- This time my hands are tied.
- Just quote your price, man.

681
01:06:55,853 --> 01:07:00,017
Look, if I get caught,
the authorities won't help me.

682
01:07:00,491 --> 01:07:05,489
We'll tell you the time and place,
the authorities will not know shit.

683
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,139
And what about him...
Faizal?

684
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:13,056
Hey, I thought you weren't
afraid of him!

685
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:28,312
Do what you have to.

686
01:07:29,552 --> 01:07:32,493
I'll handle my end.
Don't worry!

687
01:07:34,262 --> 01:07:37,977
How can I sell at 10 when the stock is worth 15?

688
01:07:38,817 --> 01:07:43,256
Atleast pay me my cost price of 14,
then it's yours.

689
01:07:48,433 --> 01:07:51,231
- You just won't learn!
- Who you calling?

690
01:07:51,803 --> 01:07:53,600
Who you calling?

691
01:07:53,805 --> 01:07:56,277
I'll have to check with
brother Faizal, won't I!

692
01:07:57,316 --> 01:07:59,936
- Don't over react, sir...
- My phone...

693
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:01,496
Please listen...

694
01:08:01,806 --> 01:08:02,966
What?

695
01:08:03,206 --> 01:08:05,970
- How about you make me an offer.
- There he goes again!

696
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:10,552
The boss has quoted 10, not me.
Talk to him if you like.

697
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,383
- Give me my phone, man.
- No way!

698
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:14,849
Return my damn phone!

699
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,582
- Give it to me!
- No!

700
01:08:16,993 --> 01:08:19,894
Ok, give me yours.
We have another one, see!

701
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:24,119
Faizal could shoot us if he's in a bad mood.

702
01:08:24,461 --> 01:08:27,152
Stop, in heaven's name, please!

703
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,155
Fine! This is now between boss
and this guy's family!

704
01:08:31,296 --> 01:08:32,993
Please don't get upset!

705
01:08:33,335 --> 01:08:34,703
Are you sure?

706
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:40,036
The dealer's told everone that
his stock worth 15, you have bought for 10.

707
01:08:40,212 --> 01:08:42,442
Poor guy's shop is up
for auction.

708
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:44,743
Hey, Lisp...

709
01:08:45,218 --> 01:08:46,387
Where you going?

710
01:08:46,488 --> 01:08:47,715
To school.

711
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,871
Right, the family scholar!

712
01:08:50,081 --> 01:08:53,414
Just milk cows and
you'll become the Chief Minister.

713
01:08:55,253 --> 01:08:56,811
What's up, asshole?

714
01:08:56,988 --> 01:08:58,218
All good, boss.

715
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:01,889
Got a good rate from a dealer.
Stuff worth 20, sold for 75.

716
01:09:02,066 --> 01:09:03,556
So has this dealer
gone bonkers?

717
01:09:03,768 --> 01:09:04,860
Why?

718
01:09:05,135 --> 01:09:07,501
He's saying that his stock
was worth 15.

719
01:09:08,004 --> 01:09:08,972
Really?

720
01:09:09,105 --> 01:09:11,294
And you bought it at 10?

721
01:09:12,734 --> 01:09:13,823
Who did he say this to?

722
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,366
He's standing right here.

723
01:09:17,203 --> 01:09:19,728
And you believe this,
brother Faizal?

724
01:09:20,373 --> 01:09:21,805
Brother Faizal...

725
01:09:23,414 --> 01:09:25,646
Why the fuck are you sounding
squeeky like a girl now?

726
01:09:26,185 --> 01:09:28,312
Someone's poisoning your
ears, boss.

727
01:09:28,788 --> 01:09:32,986
My ears are so full of wax,
that nothing can enter.

728
01:09:33,326 --> 01:09:34,551
No discussion!

729
01:09:35,057 --> 01:09:39,991
I don't care about the rates.
You say 75, I believe you.

730
01:09:40,526 --> 01:09:42,994
The dealer says 10,
I believe him too.

731
01:09:43,796 --> 01:09:46,560
10 less from 75 is 65.

732
01:09:47,231 --> 01:09:50,139
So on deliver,
I better have 65 in my hands.

733
01:10:01,872 --> 01:10:06,369
<i>Ooh! What's your name?</i>

734
01:10:06,613 --> 01:10:09,174
<i>Don't you know my name, baby?</i>

735
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:12,947
<i>I'm Munnabhai, M.B.B.S.!</i>

736
01:10:13,123 --> 01:10:16,459
<i>- Do I look nice?
- Oh, yeah!</i>

737
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:31,417
I'll never leave this town.

738
01:10:31,624 --> 01:10:34,991
I'm practically a tourist attraction here.

739
01:10:35,561 --> 01:10:39,058
Inspectors here make millions!

740
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:42,599
I say let your kids become Inspectors too.

741
01:10:43,242 --> 01:10:48,191
See, no matter who you are,
you have to come here... like these two.

742
01:10:48,566 --> 01:10:51,966
- How're you, sir?
- Hello!

743
01:10:52,404 --> 01:10:56,502
How can we work peacefully
if we get extortion threats?

744
01:10:56,777 --> 01:10:58,005
What happened?

745
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:01,280
- Know what people call cops?
- What?

746
01:11:01,816 --> 01:11:03,812
Ball-strokers of Faizal Khan!

747
01:11:04,358 --> 01:11:05,848
Really?

748
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:07,490
You find it funny?

749
01:11:07,661 --> 01:11:12,244
See, this complaint will become a formal report.

750
01:11:12,652 --> 01:11:16,350
But our investigation will be futile
without any evidence.

751
01:11:16,557 --> 01:11:18,724
Get my point?

752
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:33,108
He's inside.
The film gets over in 10 minutes.

753
01:11:33,953 --> 01:11:36,534
Okay, get in.

754
01:11:37,273 --> 01:11:43,275
Tell Guddu that I'm back from the deliveries.

755
01:11:44,185 --> 01:11:46,244
Just do as I say.

756
01:11:49,324 --> 01:11:51,053
He'll call back in 15 minutes.

757
01:11:51,192 --> 01:11:52,351
INSPECTOR SINGH

758
01:11:52,593 --> 01:11:56,195
<i>Munnabhai, M.B.B.S.!</i>

759
01:11:56,971 --> 01:11:59,331
How's it hangin', dude?

760
01:11:59,865 --> 01:12:01,984
I'll be back tomorrow morning!

761
01:12:02,259 --> 01:12:04,784
Let me in or you'll
go straight to heaven.

762
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,890
Give him a <i>Magic Hug</i>, dude!

763
01:12:07,002 --> 01:12:09,475
Here you go!

764
01:12:15,716 --> 01:12:20,386
You're no longer Tangent.
You're my side kick, <i>Circuit!</i>

765
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:25,104
And from now I'm <i>Munnabhai</i>!

766
01:12:31,421 --> 01:12:34,328
I'm going to Bombay to meet Munnabhai.

767
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:35,858
I wanna come too.

768
01:12:37,132 --> 01:12:39,929
- What'll you do there?
- Whatever you say.

769
01:12:40,301 --> 01:12:43,065
What'll you do after meeting
the actor, dumbass?

770
01:12:43,373 --> 01:12:44,868
I'll touch his feet.

771
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:46,147
Then?

772
01:12:46,447 --> 01:12:47,408
What do you mean?

773
01:12:47,508 --> 01:12:49,727
What'll you do after that, slow coach?

774
01:12:50,435 --> 01:12:52,869
- I'll stare at him.
- till when?

775
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:54,570
till my eyes hurt.

776
01:12:54,772 --> 01:12:55,868
Then?

777
01:12:55,911 --> 01:12:57,037
What do you mean?

778
01:12:57,282 --> 01:12:59,651
What will you do after staring?

779
01:13:00,822 --> 01:13:02,346
I'll close my eyes.

780
01:13:02,557 --> 01:13:03,524
Then?

781
01:13:08,294 --> 01:13:10,496
What's the rush, motherfucker?

782
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:20,988
Run, Tangent! Go and tell brother that
Sultan's tring to kill me.

783
01:13:59,088 --> 01:14:01,588
Come here you daughterfucker!

784
01:14:19,941 --> 01:14:21,203
Hey, get out of the bus.

785
01:14:59,178 --> 01:15:01,578
Why are you gasping so hard?

786
01:15:05,851 --> 01:15:07,547
Do you know him?

787
01:15:07,823 --> 01:15:09,225
Say something.

788
01:15:16,065 --> 01:15:17,389
It's Faizal!

789
01:15:19,527 --> 01:15:20,424
Hello?

790
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:23,789
Hey asshole, back from the deliveries?

791
01:15:23,998 --> 01:15:25,294
Where's my money?

792
01:15:25,933 --> 01:15:27,230
What money?

793
01:15:27,601 --> 01:15:29,034
Have you gone mad?

794
01:15:29,336 --> 01:15:32,674
My deal, my work, so my profit.

795
01:15:33,517 --> 01:15:35,451
What's wrong with your voice?

796
01:15:36,087 --> 01:15:37,884
Is Ramadhir's cock stuck
in your throat?

797
01:15:38,122 --> 01:15:40,947
Hey, mind your language.

798
01:15:43,577 --> 01:15:45,641
I say we finish him off tonight.

799
01:15:49,089 --> 01:15:51,148
No, something's fishy.

800
01:15:51,657 --> 01:15:53,421
He wasn't alone.

801
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,821
He was on speaker phone.

802
01:16:03,641 --> 01:16:05,462
He's going to kill Perpendicular!

803
01:16:05,965 --> 01:16:07,427
Who the fuck will kill him?

804
01:16:07,495 --> 01:16:09,468
- He's gonna kill him.
- Who?

805
01:16:09,671 --> 01:16:10,660
- Sultan.
- Motherfucker!

806
01:16:10,872 --> 01:16:15,002
Sir, I've got concrete evidence against Faizal.

807
01:16:15,343 --> 01:16:17,266
I'm on my way to arrest him.

808
01:16:17,711 --> 01:16:19,709
But I don't have a warrant yet.

809
01:16:20,482 --> 01:16:23,083
Could you arrange it while I arrest him?

810
01:16:24,829 --> 01:16:27,263
Okay, Sir Minister.

811
01:16:38,031 --> 01:16:40,795
- Wasn't that Faizal Khan's vehicle?
- Stop!

812
01:16:41,001 --> 01:16:43,401
It is. Turn around.

813
01:17:14,705 --> 01:17:17,787
Sultan... the motherfucker!

814
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,120
What's up, brother?

815
01:17:38,592 --> 01:17:39,987
Brother Faizal!

816
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:44,045
Please hold on...

817
01:17:47,984 --> 01:17:50,823
You need to come with me.

818
01:17:50,893 --> 01:17:53,828
Why? This is my little bro's body...

819
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:55,687
Yes sir, but...

820
01:17:55,798 --> 01:17:57,823
Shut Up! He's been murdered.

821
01:17:58,234 --> 01:18:01,035
Then hand over the body to us, sir...

822
01:18:01,174 --> 01:18:04,201
I have a complaint against you.

823
01:18:04,743 --> 01:18:06,560
Offiicer, take the body.

824
01:18:07,024 --> 01:18:08,958
I hope you've come alone...

825
01:18:12,362 --> 01:18:14,414
because the rest think
I'm a fucking fool.

826
01:18:15,554 --> 01:18:17,352
On my way.

827
01:18:21,794 --> 01:18:23,560
Aching to see you, dear.

828
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:25,994
Mohsina!

829
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,304
Please sing my song.

830
01:18:31,777 --> 01:18:32,937
Why?

831
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,776
I really need to hear it.

832
01:18:43,382 --> 01:18:48,046
<i>Don't feel frustrated, my fool...</i>

833
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:52,819
<i>Don't be nervous, my fool...</i>

834
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:58,468
<i>Don't feel frustrated, my fool...</i>

835
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:03,186
<i>Don't be nervous, my fool...</i>

836
01:19:04,063 --> 01:19:13,669
<i>Don't let anything upset your mood...
anytime, my dearfool.</i>

837
01:19:14,914 --> 01:19:19,010
<i>Whatever's wrong, dear...</i>

838
01:19:20,253 --> 01:19:25,582
<i>Whatever's wrong,
set it right, dear.</i>

839
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:31,216
<i>Don't lose hope,
and try to fight some more, dear.</i>

840
01:19:31,624 --> 01:19:35,219
<i>Fight some more, my dear fool.</i>

841
01:19:35,361 --> 01:19:36,760
Brother Definite?

842
01:19:36,862 --> 01:19:37,756
Yeah?

843
01:19:37,797 --> 01:19:41,034
Shamshad's thrilled after
getting Faizal arrested.

844
01:19:41,505 --> 01:19:44,771
So let him gloat.

845
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:50,997
If we put him in his place Faizal will notice us.

846
01:19:53,007 --> 01:19:55,703
- But boss is in jail himself.
- But you're not.

847
01:19:56,576 --> 01:19:57,566
What do you mean?

848
01:19:58,211 --> 01:19:59,577
The boss's chair is vacant.

849
01:20:00,197 --> 01:20:03,188
Let's eliminate Shamshad before
he tries to sit in it.

850
01:20:04,206 --> 01:20:07,642
The power will be indirectly Faizal's,
but directly yours.

851
01:20:07,876 --> 01:20:10,869
Once the town accepts you,
rest is upto you.

852
01:20:22,618 --> 01:20:23,847
Shamshad!

853
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:26,215
Shamshad!

854
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,797
Where is he?

855
01:20:44,736 --> 01:20:45,964
Where's Shamshad?

856
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:48,004
Where's he?

857
01:20:48,706 --> 01:20:50,230
Don't kill me...

858
01:20:51,409 --> 01:20:54,612
- Check that corner.
- Shamshad.

859
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,019
- Where are you?
- Find him.

860
01:20:57,655 --> 01:20:59,623
Where the fuck is your son?

861
01:21:01,616 --> 01:21:04,600
Check the terrace.

862
01:21:05,782 --> 01:21:08,621
Perfect time for this fucking
gun to get jammed.

863
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:16,028
- Hey, Shamshad!
- He's not upstairs.

864
01:21:18,267 --> 01:21:20,674
Look inside.
He has to be somewhere.

865
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:27,129
How did you get in without asking, bastard?

866
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:30,026
Mother...

867
01:21:31,237 --> 01:21:32,566
You hurt my mom, motherfucker?

868
01:21:32,573 --> 01:21:33,771
You were saying?

869
01:21:34,413 --> 01:21:35,675
Why did you hurt my mom?

870
01:21:35,947 --> 01:21:38,347
- Why my mother?
- Keep talking, big mouth.

871
01:21:38,617 --> 01:21:40,413
Don't do it, man...

872
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:44,885
Motherfucker...

873
01:21:50,752 --> 01:21:52,582
Son of a motherfucker!

874
01:22:04,107 --> 01:22:06,235
Come on.
Catch that motherfucker!

875
01:22:11,821 --> 01:22:13,643
Fuck off, asshole!

876
01:22:16,209 --> 01:22:18,609
Catch that... motherfucker!

877
01:22:22,215 --> 01:22:26,453
Hop on, man.
Why run when we have a scooter?

878
01:22:36,816 --> 01:22:40,804
Stop!
Motherfucker stop!

879
01:23:06,886 --> 01:23:09,287
Meet me in the next lane.

880
01:23:09,312 --> 01:23:11,311
I'll catch that motherfucker!

881
01:24:01,012 --> 01:24:03,513
Hey Definite! Stop!

882
01:24:03,744 --> 01:24:06,542
Control your cock, man.

883
01:24:15,044 --> 01:24:16,011
There he is.

884
01:24:16,445 --> 01:24:17,775
Wait for me...

885
01:24:17,801 --> 01:24:19,200
Stop the car!

886
01:24:19,225 --> 01:24:21,226
Stop the car motherfucker!

887
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,146
Where are you?

888
01:24:54,217 --> 01:24:55,446
He's at the gas station.

889
01:24:56,403 --> 01:24:57,371
Speak up.

890
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,333
He's right in front of me...
at the gas station.

891
01:25:00,701 --> 01:25:01,923
Which station?

892
01:25:02,296 --> 01:25:04,493
The new Bazaar one.
And he's got a gun.

893
01:25:04,768 --> 01:25:06,235
The fucker's got no bullets in it.

894
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:09,898
Just grab him. I'm on my way.

895
01:25:57,891 --> 01:25:59,891
Fuck your mom, motherfucker!

896
01:25:59,917 --> 01:26:01,076
Come on, asshole.

897
01:26:01,519 --> 01:26:03,077
Hop on, dickface!

898
01:26:15,492 --> 01:26:17,357
You should get into politics.

899
01:26:17,561 --> 01:26:21,332
You see, Wasseypur is a jungle of Hyenas.

900
01:26:22,038 --> 01:26:25,098
Over here brains won't get you far.

901
01:26:26,676 --> 01:26:29,269
Imagine, if Definite's gun
had bullets...

902
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:33,587
would you be having tea
with us right now?

903
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:38,369
You may have done this,
but Faizal will suspect father.

904
01:26:39,078 --> 01:26:42,047
See, you trapped Faizal,
and Sultan bumped off his brother.

905
01:26:42,481 --> 01:26:45,182
No sir, that was different...

906
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:48,350
the Perpendicular
case was different.

907
01:26:48,593 --> 01:26:50,891
Now it's in everone's best interests...

908
01:26:51,863 --> 01:26:53,989
to finish him off while he's in there.

909
01:26:54,265 --> 01:26:55,600
Who, me?

910
01:26:56,804 --> 01:26:57,935
Definite!

911
01:26:58,679 --> 01:26:59,938
That fuckwit?

912
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:01,910
Look, son...

913
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:05,218
just as steel cuts steel...

914
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,823
only one fuckwit can
deal with another fuckwit.

915
01:27:09,094 --> 01:27:10,893
But why will Definite kill Faizal?

916
01:27:11,298 --> 01:27:13,630
Because he wants to become Faizal Khan!

917
01:27:14,101 --> 01:27:16,262
You know, I've been here
for decades.

918
01:27:19,572 --> 01:27:21,507
I got Faizal's grandfather killed.

919
01:27:22,109 --> 01:27:23,909
I got Sardar killed.

920
01:27:24,545 --> 01:27:25,598
Then that...

921
01:27:27,273 --> 01:27:28,831
Danish.

922
01:27:29,141 --> 01:27:30,904
But I'm still alive.

923
01:27:32,378 --> 01:27:33,276
Why?

924
01:27:34,652 --> 01:27:35,620
Why?

925
01:27:37,822 --> 01:27:40,085
Because sir is the real
Godfather!

926
01:27:41,226 --> 01:27:42,590
You tell me why?

927
01:27:43,295 --> 01:27:44,660
Why?

928
01:27:46,802 --> 01:27:49,631
Because I am not a
big fan of cinema..

929
01:27:50,264 --> 01:27:51,592
Cinema?

930
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:57,658
In my youth, all my friends used to
watch 'Ganga Jamuna'...

931
01:27:58,102 --> 01:28:00,474
and wanted to be Dilip Kumar.

932
01:28:01,811 --> 01:28:04,575
The girls were crazy about Dev Anand.

933
01:28:05,983 --> 01:28:07,848
Then came another phase.

934
01:28:09,553 --> 01:28:11,917
Women liked Rajesh Khanna.

935
01:28:13,286 --> 01:28:17,147
And guys liked that
Amitabh Bachchan fellow.

936
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:21,184
And these days they like that...

937
01:28:23,122 --> 01:28:25,858
- he has a very nice name...
- Salman Khan.

938
01:28:27,066 --> 01:28:30,091
- And that...
- Sunil and Nargis Dutt's son...

939
01:28:30,469 --> 01:28:32,130
Sanjay Dutt.

940
01:28:32,131 --> 01:28:36,000
Ever fucker's got his own movie
playing inside his head.

941
01:28:36,965 --> 01:28:40,055
Every fucker is tring to become
the Hero of his own imaginary film.

942
01:28:40,832 --> 01:28:43,996
I swear, as long as there is
fucking cinema in this country...

943
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,332
people will continue to
be fooled.

944
01:28:49,446 --> 01:28:53,679
<i>I won't recognize him by face...</i>

945
01:28:54,385 --> 01:28:58,287
<i>I might not even know
his name...</i>

946
01:29:04,885 --> 01:29:09,481
<i>'cos my heart will recognize
him instantly.</i>

947
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:14,856
<i>The heart is crazy,
it is unstoppable...</i>

948
01:29:18,914 --> 01:29:20,914
Motherfucking asshole..

949
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:23,701
..you're alive only because
of Faizal, asshole.

950
01:29:23,907 --> 01:29:27,059
I'll fry you with my AK-47
once we are out, bastard.

951
01:29:27,133 --> 01:29:29,198
Stop this shit.

952
01:29:32,345 --> 01:29:33,334
Definite!

953
01:29:33,578 --> 01:29:36,776
I'm not afraid of your
stupid threats, fucker.

954
01:29:36,983 --> 01:29:38,886
My tiny country revolver is
enough for you.

955
01:29:39,021 --> 01:29:40,753
Fuck your mom!

956
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:43,460
Worthless piece of shit!

957
01:29:43,484 --> 01:29:45,485
Stay within your limits!

958
01:29:46,565 --> 01:29:50,214
Shamshad's withdrawn the
case against you.

959
01:29:51,286 --> 01:29:54,159
Why? Does he want me to marry his sis?

960
01:29:54,829 --> 01:29:57,320
He's trying to make an alliance with you.

961
01:29:58,166 --> 01:29:59,632
So what should I do?

962
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:00,962
He's here.

963
01:30:05,412 --> 01:30:07,539
You chill here.

964
01:30:12,978 --> 01:30:14,529
Start the bike.

965
01:30:17,443 --> 01:30:19,315
Now why's he here?

966
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,251
Hey, man.

967
01:30:21,453 --> 01:30:23,580
- What's up!
- How're you?

968
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:25,287
Got the cash I sent you?

969
01:30:25,358 --> 01:30:27,417
That's how I bought
2 kilos of apples.

970
01:30:27,726 --> 01:30:30,861
- You bought apples for 200 grand?
- But they're from Kashmir.

971
01:30:31,304 --> 01:30:34,101
Our terrorists grew up eating
them... want one?

972
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,495
Sure... sit.

973
01:30:36,935 --> 01:30:38,362
Motherfucker!

974
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:35,712
Shamshad?

975
01:31:38,519 --> 01:31:40,078
Tear him a new asshole!

976
01:31:41,189 --> 01:31:44,425
Hey, isn't this Faizal Khan's house?

977
01:31:44,532 --> 01:31:47,626
- We are walking into trouble, brother.
- Quiet!

978
01:31:51,736 --> 01:31:53,736
- Gimme a gun.
- Here.

979
01:32:07,582 --> 01:32:09,383
Anyone home?

980
01:32:12,088 --> 01:32:13,209
Faizal Khan?

981
01:32:13,417 --> 01:32:14,673
He's in jail, brother.

982
01:32:14,878 --> 01:32:15,901
I know that.

983
01:32:16,046 --> 01:32:17,741
Brother!

984
01:32:21,551 --> 01:32:24,651
Please come in.
Would you like some tea?

985
01:32:26,862 --> 01:32:28,353
What happened to your arm?

986
01:33:25,277 --> 01:33:27,101
<i>Shama had gone into a coma.</i>

987
01:33:27,273 --> 01:33:30,708
<i>Faizal also mellowed down.
Everone's moves had back-fired.</i>

988
01:33:31,292 --> 01:33:34,285
<i>Shamshad was also
fighting for his life.</i>

989
01:33:34,779 --> 01:33:39,055
<i>Ramadhir knew that Sultan
had made a grave mistake.</i>

990
01:33:39,193 --> 01:33:42,094
<i>This was the first time that a woman
had been shot in Wasseypur.</i>

991
01:33:42,095 --> 01:33:45,394
<i>By custom, she was Danish's widow first
and then Sultan's sister.</i>

992
01:33:45,397 --> 01:33:48,021
<i>And no one knew this better
than me.</i>

993
01:33:48,426 --> 01:33:54,657
<i>An eerie silence had descended,
but I knew it carried a storm in its belly.</i>

994
01:33:55,196 --> 01:34:00,065
<i>Ramadhir and his son knew that
Faizal's ego had been hurt.</i>

995
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:04,302
<i>They also knew that the town shared
and supported his sentiment.</i>

996
01:34:04,511 --> 01:34:07,206
<i>Their one mistake had him
so powerful...</i>

997
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:10,974
<i>that it was important to end him
before he realised this.</i>

998
01:34:12,545 --> 01:34:16,978
<i>Shamshad's gang had to leave town
as no one wanted to join them.</i>

999
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:20,277
<i>Faizal Khan was the new Don.</i>

1000
01:35:18,776 --> 01:35:21,110
Don't give Faizal a chance
to stabilise.

1001
01:35:22,282 --> 01:35:24,267
He's just been released
from jail today.

1002
01:35:25,207 --> 01:35:29,140
His family must be
celebrating his return...

1003
01:35:30,913 --> 01:35:32,437
know what I mean?

1004
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:38,211
Just a minute...

1005
01:35:39,887 --> 01:35:43,384
Yes, father.
No, I'm not planning a thing.

1006
01:35:44,299 --> 01:35:46,892
I'm doing as you had asked, father.

1007
01:35:47,167 --> 01:35:48,787
I'm lying really low.

1008
01:35:50,589 --> 01:35:52,282
Goodbye, father!

1009
01:35:59,703 --> 01:36:02,193
There's going to be a new
police chief in town.

1010
01:36:05,275 --> 01:36:07,213
Stay on high alert.

1011
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,619
4 jeeps will do day-night
surveillance.

1012
01:36:09,823 --> 01:36:14,744
Don't be afraid.
But keep your guns close.

1013
01:36:15,277 --> 01:36:17,711
But don't make a move.

1014
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:19,947
Believe me, we won't
be able to anyway.

1015
01:36:20,022 --> 01:36:23,788
- You can't, for sure.
- No one can, sir.

1016
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,291
Get out!

1017
01:36:32,201 --> 01:36:35,004
If you fly so high
you might reach heaven!

1018
01:36:35,807 --> 01:36:38,062
Now where's the
Minister's number?

1019
01:36:42,867 --> 01:36:46,137
Greetings, Mr. Minister, sir!
It's me, Inspector Singh...

1020
01:36:47,278 --> 01:36:50,975
in charge of Dhanbad.
Greetings!

1021
01:36:52,817 --> 01:36:59,061
Thought I'd let you know that the new
chief is acting too big for his boots...

1022
01:37:00,426 --> 01:37:01,548
What?!

1023
01:37:02,355 --> 01:37:03,581
You've posted him here?

1024
01:37:10,634 --> 01:37:11,999
What are you doing?

1025
01:37:12,334 --> 01:37:15,395
My hands are tired thinking
about you.

1026
01:37:16,006 --> 01:37:18,633
- Not now.
- Why not?

1027
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:21,742
You're back after ages,
everone wants to meet you.

1028
01:37:21,845 --> 01:37:24,076
But I only want to meet you.

1029
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:28,003
You're incorrigible!
Sis-in-law is in hospital and you're...

1030
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:31,576
Don't drag her between us,
she'll get stuck.

1031
01:37:33,546 --> 01:37:34,949
Please...

1032
01:37:37,589 --> 01:37:39,079
the show's
about to start.

1033
01:37:54,899 --> 01:37:57,628
What's the status on Ramadhir?

1034
01:38:01,711 --> 01:38:04,408
And which hospital is
Shamshad in?

1035
01:38:59,062 --> 01:39:00,153
Fuck off!

1036
01:39:37,189 --> 01:39:38,748
Lower the volume.

1037
01:39:56,704 --> 01:39:58,695
Just watch your show.

1038
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:01,032
But what happened?

1039
01:40:09,823 --> 01:40:13,338
- I see Faizal Khan, Boss.
- Then get in and kill the motherfucker.

1040
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:16,974
Get out, Faizal.
Come outside, asshole.

1041
01:40:23,295 --> 01:40:25,161
Fucker's locked it.

1042
01:40:27,366 --> 01:40:28,699
Give me a bomb.

1043
01:40:30,543 --> 01:40:33,103
Definite?
Uncle, where are you?

1044
01:40:33,212 --> 01:40:35,439
In the offiice.
Where are you?

1045
01:40:40,169 --> 01:40:43,665
Stay put. Don't worry.
They're just stray shots.

1046
01:40:44,011 --> 01:40:45,979
Stay there till I tell you, uncle.

1047
01:40:57,430 --> 01:41:00,981
Get the bombs, quick!
Blow this shit up.

1048
01:41:05,691 --> 01:41:07,354
Everbody get down!

1049
01:41:19,885 --> 01:41:20,716
Faizal!

1050
01:41:20,986 --> 01:41:22,647
You go ahead.
I'll follow.

1051
01:41:29,879 --> 01:41:32,745
- Where are you, Definite?
- On my way. Don't worry!

1052
01:41:32,883 --> 01:41:35,913
I'll worry if I stay alive, bastard.

1053
01:41:37,826 --> 01:41:41,387
Death is certain. If God doesn't kill me,
this neighbourhood will.

1054
01:41:41,496 --> 01:41:44,435
But I'll make these
bastards pay.

1055
01:41:53,531 --> 01:41:56,060
Just stay calm
and don't make a move.

1056
01:41:56,338 --> 01:41:57,965
But where are you going?

1057
01:41:58,174 --> 01:42:00,773
- I'll come with you, brother!
- No, you won't.

1058
01:42:00,915 --> 01:42:05,045
- But where are you going?
- Keep my phone with you.

1059
01:42:06,387 --> 01:42:08,879
But don't pick it up if it rings!

1060
01:42:10,297 --> 01:42:13,312
Shut the door
and don't let anyone out.

1061
01:42:20,991 --> 01:42:23,657
Faizal!

1062
01:46:36,796 --> 01:46:41,226
<i>Don't feel frustrated, my fool...</i>

1063
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:45,666
<i>Don't be nervous, my fool...</i>

1064
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:50,269
<i>Don't feel frustrated, my fool...</i>

1065
01:46:50,475 --> 01:46:54,434
<i>Don't be nervous, my fool...</i>

1066
01:46:54,746 --> 01:47:03,443
<i>Don't let anything upset your mood...
anytime, my dearfool.</i>

1067
01:47:12,396 --> 01:47:16,526
<i>Whatever's wrong, dear...</i>

1068
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,362
<i>Whatever's wrong,
set it right, dear.</i>

1069
01:47:21,638 --> 01:47:25,793
<i>Don't lose hope,
and try to fight some more, dear.</i>

1070
01:47:25,933 --> 01:47:29,890
<i>Fight some more, my dear fool.</i>

1071
01:48:09,547 --> 01:48:10,771
Hey, Guddu!

1072
01:48:10,910 --> 01:48:12,496
Are you okay, brother?

1073
01:48:15,175 --> 01:48:16,472
- Faizal?
- Get my Pistol...

1074
01:48:16,910 --> 01:48:20,004
- Where did you get hurt?
- Did you get shot at?

1075
01:48:20,414 --> 01:48:21,744
Everyone get inside.

1076
01:48:23,083 --> 01:48:24,886
I'll kill those fuckers!

1077
01:48:26,058 --> 01:48:28,789
And where had you
run off, asshole?

1078
01:48:29,127 --> 01:48:32,586
- I was just in the market...
- I phoned you motherfucker!

1079
01:48:32,865 --> 01:48:35,454
If only I knew, I'd have killed him
when he passed me by.

1080
01:48:35,563 --> 01:48:37,187
Please get inside.

1081
01:48:37,494 --> 01:48:38,985
Ladies, please get inside.

1082
01:48:39,231 --> 01:48:42,359
- Where are you going?
- Shut the door!

1083
01:48:43,035 --> 01:48:44,899
Be careful, son!

1084
01:48:45,203 --> 01:48:46,933
Just get inside!

1085
01:48:58,288 --> 01:48:59,716
Get the car...

1086
01:49:00,017 --> 01:49:01,944
and I don't need you.

1087
01:49:02,978 --> 01:49:07,283
You guys guard the house.
Dont let a soul in.

1088
01:49:09,156 --> 01:49:10,282
Faizal?

1089
01:49:11,992 --> 01:49:15,364
Go home, uncle.
It was that fucking Sultan!

1090
01:49:15,769 --> 01:49:17,702
Just guard the house, uncle.

1091
01:49:26,342 --> 01:49:28,345
Jabbar!

1092
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:29,671
Sisterfuckers!

1093
01:49:31,311 --> 01:49:34,040
The fucker's coming here!

1094
01:49:43,461 --> 01:49:46,327
Go back...

1095
01:49:49,288 --> 01:49:51,047
Let's get out of here.

1096
01:49:57,165 --> 01:49:59,030
Come on, hurry!

1097
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:38,284
Hold on...

1098
01:50:39,028 --> 01:50:40,723
Some cops have come home.

1099
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:41,886
Why?

1100
01:50:42,063 --> 01:50:43,866
They want to offer protection.

1101
01:50:44,339 --> 01:50:45,499
Give me the phone.

1102
01:50:47,109 --> 01:50:49,543
Who's the fucking officer?
Put him on.

1103
01:50:49,645 --> 01:50:51,613
I don't need your protection.

1104
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:54,076
Faizal can protect himself.

1105
01:50:54,287 --> 01:50:56,380
Look, this time you were lucky but...

1106
01:50:56,658 --> 01:50:59,087
Shut up and listen.

1107
01:51:00,351 --> 01:51:03,107
It's Ramadhir who needs your protection.

1108
01:51:03,214 --> 01:51:06,551
So please bring an army
'cos I will riddle him with bullets.

1109
01:51:06,688 --> 01:51:08,717
Do not let him stabilise!

1110
01:51:08,895 --> 01:51:15,426
Just kill them all... family members,
servants, the laundry guy, even pets!

1111
01:51:34,150 --> 01:51:35,674
Hold on.

1112
01:51:41,957 --> 01:51:45,661
- What's this?
- Scissor to cut his plaster.

1113
01:52:16,412 --> 01:52:19,610
We'll be back soon.

1114
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:22,149
Now please don't get
distracted, ladies!

1115
01:52:28,198 --> 01:52:30,029
It's for my daughter-in-law...

1116
01:52:48,078 --> 01:52:52,816
- Do you have Pathani shirts?
- Sure, we have several...

1117
01:52:53,989 --> 01:52:55,820
Any other styles?

1118
01:52:56,725 --> 01:52:59,589
Brother, you're in Dhanbad...

1119
01:53:00,358 --> 01:53:03,046
but the address you want
is of Varanasi City.

1120
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:10,101
Varanasi!
This is Dhanbad!

1121
01:53:13,652 --> 01:53:17,613
This says Varanasi, man.
You're in another city.

1122
01:53:18,058 --> 01:53:20,356
Still don't get it?
Tell you what...

1123
01:53:29,993 --> 01:53:31,324
Run!

1124
01:53:53,981 --> 01:53:59,181
Shut ever shop.
Shut the whole motherfucking city down.

1125
01:53:59,521 --> 01:54:02,821
Son of a bitch murdered my mother
in the middle of the street.

1126
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:08,098
You fucking rat...

1127
01:54:10,101 --> 01:54:11,223
Hey, Definite!

1128
01:54:11,398 --> 01:54:14,021
This rat lives with the fucker
who killed mom.

1129
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:28,346
I want Sultan, dead or alive.
I know that bastard's behind this.

1130
01:54:33,559 --> 01:54:35,418
Open up, bastards!

1131
01:54:38,682 --> 01:54:40,985
Where is Sultan?

1132
01:54:41,957 --> 01:54:43,151
Where's Sultan?

1133
01:54:43,391 --> 01:54:45,019
He doesn't live here
anymore.

1134
01:54:45,193 --> 01:54:50,291
He moved out the day his sister
got married to Danish.

1135
01:55:09,814 --> 01:55:11,873
BHAGALPUR JUNCTION

1136
01:55:15,486 --> 01:55:18,220
Sultan goes to the mosque for
his afternoon prayers.

1137
01:55:18,428 --> 01:55:22,865
He parks outside the vegetable market
but leaves his gun behind.

1138
01:55:23,398 --> 01:55:26,447
So as soon as he enters the mosque,
you empty his gun.

1139
01:55:41,544 --> 01:55:45,611
After that he goes to the
meat market.

1140
01:55:46,286 --> 01:55:49,368
He then goes home
via the bazaar.

1141
01:55:49,743 --> 01:55:51,606
That's where we should
catch him.

1142
01:55:53,578 --> 01:55:55,279
Some bread and stew, please.

1143
01:56:12,769 --> 01:56:13,860
Hello.

1144
01:56:14,067 --> 01:56:17,227
Sultan was behind me.

1145
01:56:17,601 --> 01:56:22,442
He'll go to the meat market now.
Stay with him, and stay on line.

1146
01:56:28,118 --> 01:56:28,948
Yeah!

1147
01:56:29,019 --> 01:56:30,152
Where are you?

1148
01:56:30,153 --> 01:56:31,313
I'm at the bazaar.

1149
01:56:31,388 --> 01:56:33,585
He's headed towards you.

1150
01:56:33,692 --> 01:56:34,518
So?

1151
01:56:34,593 --> 01:56:38,111
- Keep hitting the kick-shaft.
- But then my scooter will start.

1152
01:56:38,384 --> 01:56:40,875
So first remove the spark plug
and then keep kicking.

1153
01:56:41,386 --> 01:56:43,082
Show me the ripe ones.

1154
01:56:45,263 --> 01:56:46,924
Put them in a polythene bag.

1155
01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:54,269
- What's the status?
- He's buying fruits.

1156
01:56:54,338 --> 01:56:56,675
Why the fuck isn't he
buying meat?

1157
01:56:56,979 --> 01:56:58,945
- Which fruit is he buying?
- Banana.

1158
01:56:59,013 --> 01:57:03,167
Must be having loose motions!
What else?

1159
01:57:03,373 --> 01:57:06,434
- I can't tell. Shall I go closer?
- Let it be.

1160
01:57:06,644 --> 01:57:13,112
Poor guy doesn't know we'll eat his fruits.
Shall I ask him to get lychees?

1161
01:57:13,256 --> 01:57:16,693
Shut up, asshole!
It's not lychee season yet.

1162
01:57:16,793 --> 01:57:17,852
What's up?

1163
01:57:17,962 --> 01:57:20,123
Fucker's buying bananas.

1164
01:57:20,231 --> 01:57:21,288
For whose ass?

1165
01:57:21,365 --> 01:57:24,557
Yours!
Just keep kicking the shaft!

1166
01:57:24,663 --> 01:57:27,990
I don't want to break it.
I'll kick it once he's done shopping.

1167
01:57:28,128 --> 01:57:30,595
Brother... he's moving.

1168
01:57:39,445 --> 01:57:40,707
He's going into the
vegetable market.

1169
01:57:40,812 --> 01:57:42,473
Why's he going to the
vegetable market?

1170
01:57:42,581 --> 01:57:44,105
But I'm not going anywhere.

1171
01:57:44,383 --> 01:57:46,284
I'm not talking to you.

1172
01:57:46,419 --> 01:57:48,904
But why won't you talk
to me, sir?

1173
01:57:48,983 --> 01:57:52,246
Fucking Dumb and Dumber!
I was talking to Definite.

1174
01:57:52,317 --> 01:57:54,944
So talk to one of us
at a time.

1175
01:57:56,288 --> 01:57:58,780
Hello?
Bastard disconnected me.

1176
01:57:58,892 --> 01:58:00,626
So what fruit do you get in a
vegetable market?

1177
01:58:00,698 --> 01:58:01,721
Custard apple?

1178
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:04,464
Isn't that sugar-apple?

1179
01:58:04,668 --> 01:58:06,728
Well... some call it pumpkin.

1180
01:58:08,773 --> 01:58:09,667
Yes?

1181
01:58:09,674 --> 01:58:11,058
He's buying jackfruit.

1182
01:58:11,236 --> 01:58:13,664
- Jackfruit?
- Yes, brother.

1183
01:58:14,367 --> 01:58:17,302
Now why would he want to
buy jackfruit?

1184
01:58:18,071 --> 01:58:20,972
I feel... he wants to pickle it.

1185
01:58:21,241 --> 01:58:22,902
Can't one make a curry
out of it?

1186
01:58:23,010 --> 01:58:26,383
Sure. Mummy makes mean
jackfruit balls!

1187
01:58:26,452 --> 01:58:30,980
My granny used to fr finely chopped
jackfruit and serve it with rice.

1188
01:58:31,224 --> 01:58:33,249
Don't Brahmins consider
it their 'meat'?

1189
01:58:33,725 --> 01:58:35,414
What's up?

1190
01:58:35,488 --> 01:58:37,714
I've been calling you for eons,
you deaf fuck!

1191
01:58:37,785 --> 01:58:40,816
But you asked me to
speak to only one.

1192
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:45,396
So talk to me, fuckwit.
I'm suffering in this heat...

1193
01:58:45,464 --> 01:58:46,761
Sultan's moving.

1194
01:58:46,833 --> 01:58:48,357
But this was your idea...

1195
01:58:49,103 --> 01:58:51,940
There's an aquarium inside
my fucking helmet.

1196
01:58:52,611 --> 01:58:54,010
Sultan's in the car!

1197
01:58:54,079 --> 01:58:57,481
Then chuck the helmet.

1198
01:58:57,482 --> 01:58:59,908
Show that pretty face to
the world... come on!

1199
01:59:00,741 --> 01:59:02,464
He's right behind Definite.

1200
01:59:02,537 --> 01:59:03,399
Shut up!

1201
01:59:03,471 --> 01:59:05,072
He's behind you.

1202
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:07,748
No, he's in front of me.

1203
01:59:24,794 --> 01:59:28,193
<i>After Sultan's death
Faizal had no threats in Wasseypur.</i>

1204
01:59:28,262 --> 01:59:34,002
<i>Danish, his widow, Nagma, Asgar...
Definite had avenged them all.</i>

1205
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:38,199
<i>To cement Definite's lethal reputation,
Faizal asked him to surrender.</i>

1206
01:59:38,378 --> 01:59:40,682
<i>Ramadhir was also watching
this keenly.</i>

1207
01:59:40,753 --> 01:59:44,017
<i>Ever since Definite was a child,
Ramadhir had hoped to make him his weapon.</i>

1208
01:59:44,623 --> 01:59:48,776
<i>But Definite was untamable.
He had no masters.</i>

1209
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:52,072
<i>And Sultan's death had made him
even more fierce.</i>

1210
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:56,487
<i>So Ramadhir used his trump card...
Durga!</i>

1211
01:59:56,591 --> 02:00:03,429
Who took care of you and
your son after Sardar's death?

1212
02:00:04,634 --> 02:00:06,833
I'd also given you my word that...

1213
02:00:08,342 --> 02:00:12,133
Definite will get what is
rightfully his.

1214
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:16,935
Don't worry!
He'll take it himself.

1215
02:00:17,305 --> 02:00:18,797
It's not easy.

1216
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:21,204
Definite's not only in jail...

1217
02:00:22,615 --> 02:00:24,914
he's also accepted all of
Faizal's crimes.

1218
02:00:25,185 --> 02:00:27,653
Sometimes I feel like he is...

1219
02:00:29,123 --> 02:00:31,290
not your son...

1220
02:00:32,332 --> 02:00:34,320
as much as Sardar's.

1221
02:00:34,397 --> 02:00:37,647
<i>Ramadhir wanted to drive a wedge
between Faizal and Definite.</i>

1222
02:00:37,755 --> 02:00:40,017
<i>All he needed was Faizal's
one weakness.</i>

1223
02:00:40,156 --> 02:00:42,681
<i>And Ramadhir knew which one...</i>

1224
02:00:42,959 --> 02:00:46,196
<i>Money... black money!
Whatever the source or amount.</i>

1225
02:00:46,301 --> 02:00:51,238
<i>Faizal had no business sense,
people came to him only out of fear.</i>

1226
02:00:51,339 --> 02:00:53,205
<i>Ramadhir took advantage of this.</i>

1227
02:00:53,342 --> 02:00:57,408
<i>So he first shifted Definite to
the state capital prison.</i>

1228
02:00:57,519 --> 02:01:00,343
Prison is in your blood, isn't it?

1229
02:01:01,177 --> 02:01:04,073
Please leave.
I'm fine... without you.

1230
02:01:04,175 --> 02:01:06,977
I raised a killer,
not a coward.

1231
02:01:08,683 --> 02:01:12,955
Shamshad's still in hospital,
and Ramadhir is unarmed.

1232
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:16,621
But he's in the capital
where you can't touch him.

1233
02:01:17,031 --> 02:01:18,623
He has to return... someday.

1234
02:01:18,699 --> 02:01:20,963
They've shifted Definite to the capital prison.

1235
02:01:20,974 --> 02:01:22,104
Who told you that?

1236
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,035
He called.

1237
02:01:23,038 --> 02:01:25,256
- Why didn't he call me?
- You don't pick up your calls.

1238
02:01:25,332 --> 02:01:26,693
Get me the prison in-charge.

1239
02:01:26,863 --> 02:01:28,990
Brother...
someone's here to see you.

1240
02:01:29,165 --> 02:01:30,427
Let him in.

1241
02:01:35,011 --> 02:01:37,877
Hello! This is Faizal Khan.

1242
02:01:38,681 --> 02:01:40,842
Why has Definite been shifted
to the capital?

1243
02:01:41,951 --> 02:01:44,856
Definite!
I mean the name.

1244
02:01:46,757 --> 02:01:48,220
What's the meaning of 'Definite'?

1245
02:01:48,686 --> 02:01:49,775
Definite.

1246
02:01:50,149 --> 02:01:52,810
- What's his real name?
- Definite.

1247
02:01:53,017 --> 02:01:55,008
Yeah,
but what's his real name?

1248
02:01:55,286 --> 02:01:57,418
Definite's real name is Definite.

1249
02:01:58,193 --> 02:02:00,691
Guddu, what is Definite's real name?

1250
02:02:01,469 --> 02:02:02,959
It is Definite.

1251
02:02:05,073 --> 02:02:07,701
What had dad named him
before "Definite"?

1252
02:02:07,809 --> 02:02:10,836
You know, like Perpendicular's real
name was Babua.

1253
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:12,900
I've always known him as Definite.

1254
02:02:13,008 --> 02:02:14,971
So what's the meaning of
the word "Definite"?

1255
02:02:15,973 --> 02:02:19,739
- "Definite" is... what is definite!
- So what is definite?

1256
02:02:20,678 --> 02:02:22,941
See, "Def" means deaf...

1257
02:02:23,180 --> 02:02:25,050
And "nite" means net!

1258
02:02:25,222 --> 02:02:27,850
Definite is
that which is certain.

1259
02:02:27,858 --> 02:02:30,827
<i>Neither Faizal nor his gang spoke English.</i>

1260
02:02:30,994 --> 02:02:33,461
<i>But Iqlakh did.
And Faizal liked that.</i>

1261
02:02:33,695 --> 02:02:35,854
<i>However, Iqlakh was
Ramadhir's mole.</i>

1262
02:02:36,063 --> 02:02:40,822
<i>He was going to make Faizal pots of money,
and make him forget about Definite.</i>

1263
02:02:40,993 --> 02:02:43,222
<i>Indian trains often get derailed.</i>

1264
02:02:43,562 --> 02:02:46,160
Ever wondered where
these trains go?

1265
02:02:46,735 --> 02:02:52,270
The govemment auctions these trains
but at rates that are 40 years old.

1266
02:02:52,982 --> 02:02:55,075
Now an old compartment
is valueless.

1267
02:02:55,184 --> 02:02:59,275
But if one breaks it down to its components,
its value multiplies.

1268
02:03:00,418 --> 02:03:03,901
The wheels, springs and
sheets sell seperately,

1269
02:03:03,902 --> 02:03:07,318
and the rest can be melted
down to make pipes.

1270
02:03:07,851 --> 02:03:09,979
And that's how a whole train
gets auctioned.

1271
02:03:10,287 --> 02:03:14,387
From the Internet to any government
commodity, it's all auctioned.

1272
02:03:15,099 --> 02:03:17,795
Bidders come from all over
the country for this...

1273
02:03:20,737 --> 02:03:22,394
<i>But Iqlakh also had a past.</i>

1274
02:03:25,966 --> 02:03:31,835
<i>20 years ago, his father had abducted
and raped a Wasseypur girl.</i>

1275
02:03:32,272 --> 02:03:40,450
<i>Sardar had forced him to divorce
his first wife to marry this girl.</i>

1276
02:03:40,557 --> 02:03:45,493
<i>Iqlakh was Mohsin's son from
the abandoned first wife.</i>

1277
02:03:46,292 --> 02:03:51,847
How can Iqlakh be Ramadhir's guy?
He's an educated city-slicker.

1278
02:03:52,424 --> 02:03:58,124
Thing is, Iqlakh was left fatherless
because of your dad...

1279
02:03:58,263 --> 02:04:02,597
while Ramadhir supported
and educated him.

1280
02:04:02,867 --> 02:04:07,036
And here is the result for
the tender issued on...

1281
02:04:07,278 --> 02:04:10,006
<i>But Faizal had bought into
Iqlakh's vision.</i>

1282
02:04:10,145 --> 02:04:13,967
<i>His ambition now included
all of Dhanbad.</i>

1283
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:17,705
<i>And so he chose to
overlook Iqlakh's past.</i>

1284
02:04:18,178 --> 02:04:21,875
I've been sent by Faizal Khan.
And from now we will run a syndicate here.

1285
02:04:22,182 --> 02:04:27,055
All bids will go through Faizal Khan.
And only he will approve who gets the tender.

1286
02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:28,549
What the hell?

1287
02:04:28,625 --> 02:04:30,222
This is hooliganism!

1288
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:31,429
Sit!

1289
02:04:31,967 --> 02:04:34,956
- Any other issues?
- You can't bully us like this!

1290
02:04:37,461 --> 02:04:40,156
You may now leave your
quotations here and go.

1291
02:04:42,617 --> 02:04:46,679
<i>Iqlakh first made Faizal a fearful figure
amongst the traders.</i>

1292
02:04:46,755 --> 02:04:48,847
<i>He then took control of the
Auction Room.</i>

1293
02:04:48,958 --> 02:04:53,418
<i>And before the next auctions
Faizal himself bribed railway officials.</i>

1294
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:57,595
All you need to do is tell them I'm your guy.

1295
02:04:59,535 --> 02:05:05,156
The auction will be led by Iqlakh.
And his word will be the final one.

1296
02:05:05,228 --> 02:05:08,133
And all of you will submit to him.
Cool?

1297
02:05:08,602 --> 02:05:11,366
You said "submit"
instead of "stand by".

1298
02:05:11,605 --> 02:05:14,072
- What is "stand by"?
- Total support.

1299
02:05:14,207 --> 02:05:16,803
- So what's "submit"?
- Total surrender.

1300
02:05:16,912 --> 02:05:18,107
So I was right.

1301
02:05:18,199 --> 02:05:21,662
<i>To break this syndicate, the government
started auctioning on the internet.</i>

1302
02:05:21,742 --> 02:05:29,063
<i>So the bids became faceless and
the bidders didn't fear the syndicate.</i>

1303
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:32,866
- The Auction's done.
- When?

1304
02:05:33,236 --> 02:05:34,965
The bastards did it on the internet.

1305
02:05:35,238 --> 02:05:39,800
The auction is over, brother.
Some guy from Gujarat got the tender.

1306
02:05:39,976 --> 02:05:43,673
Well, guess where he'll have to
come to collect the goods?

1307
02:06:12,026 --> 02:06:14,113
- Salaam!
- What do you want?

1308
02:06:21,432 --> 02:06:23,128
Move it!

1309
02:06:23,601 --> 02:06:25,158
What the hell do you want?

1310
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:39,447
<i>And thus things stayed in Faizal's control
and he made pots of money.</i>

1311
02:06:39,556 --> 02:06:45,729
<i>His power over the auctions and railways
opened a goldmine of wealth.</i>

1312
02:06:45,969 --> 02:06:49,961
<i>Eventually Faizal became blind
with power and black money...</i>

1313
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:53,099
<i>just like Ramadhir had wanted.</i>

1314
02:06:53,309 --> 02:06:56,042
<i>Definite was left rotting in jail.</i>

1315
02:07:03,146 --> 02:07:04,670
It's all about people's power!

1316
02:07:04,981 --> 02:07:09,180
Everone respects you here
since you've opened a school.

1317
02:07:09,656 --> 02:07:14,494
If you represent Wasseypur in
these elections you will surely win.

1318
02:07:14,896 --> 02:07:16,330
No one can touch you then.

1319
02:07:16,599 --> 02:07:19,193
In fact, stand as an independent
candidate and win.

1320
02:07:19,402 --> 02:07:22,560
Then any party will want an
alliance with you.

1321
02:07:22,767 --> 02:07:25,493
Once that happens
you can openly dictate!

1322
02:07:25,798 --> 02:07:31,258
What if I contest against Ramadhir
from Dhanbad, and not Wasseypur?

1323
02:07:34,308 --> 02:07:36,007
Against me?

1324
02:07:40,951 --> 02:07:44,513
- Find out what his plans are.
- Yes, father.

1325
02:07:44,721 --> 02:07:52,986
<i>Full of venom,
I was raised by scorpions.</i>

1326
02:07:55,493 --> 02:08:02,268
<i>Bite me if you dare.</i>

1327
02:08:04,908 --> 02:08:14,668
<i>I swear by my honour,
I will tear you apart.</i>

1328
02:08:15,039 --> 02:08:26,082
<i>Like a snake without a tail,
you will writhe in pain.</i>

1329
02:08:36,593 --> 02:08:39,458
<i>You're the bastard child
of honour...</i>

1330
02:08:39,529 --> 02:08:43,729
<i>I swear by your whore mother...</i>

1331
02:08:45,003 --> 02:08:51,573
<i>as I dare you to enter
my court of evil.</i>

1332
02:08:53,117 --> 02:09:00,138
<i>Now Ramadhir got Definite released from jail
and sent J.P. to meet him.</i>

1333
02:09:00,413 --> 02:09:05,111
<i>But J.P.'s agenda was not so much Faizal
as much as his own father.</i>

1334
02:09:05,317 --> 02:09:09,948
<i>He knew that only one man could
remove Ramadhir out of his way.</i>

1335
02:09:10,123 --> 02:09:11,886
Faizal Khan!

1336
02:09:14,396 --> 02:09:16,334
How will you get him to
do that?

1337
02:09:19,305 --> 02:09:24,596
If you do as I say,
it will all fall into place.

1338
02:09:25,463 --> 02:09:27,056
And what do I get?

1339
02:09:29,169 --> 02:09:30,937
You get Wasseypur!

1340
02:09:34,512 --> 02:09:36,173
And you get?

1341
02:10:37,495 --> 02:10:41,519
Ramadhir has promised me your land
and Wasseypur if I kill you.

1342
02:10:41,663 --> 02:10:45,399
- He's given mom a million as advance.
- What'd you do?

1343
02:10:45,939 --> 02:10:47,567
I kept the advance.

1344
02:10:48,943 --> 02:10:53,277
He's asked me to watch you 24 hours
and report to him.

1345
02:10:54,517 --> 02:10:56,045
So when's the D-day?

1346
02:10:56,723 --> 02:10:58,277
On the Election day.

1347
02:10:58,819 --> 02:11:01,778
Iqlakh will kill you.
I'm the back-up!

1348
02:11:01,879 --> 02:11:08,583
<i>I'm the Devil's son,
raised in the laps of witches.</i>

1349
02:11:08,890 --> 02:11:12,228
<i>I'm the keeper of graves,
dogs are my supper.</i>

1350
02:11:12,365 --> 02:11:15,630
<i>That's funny 'cos humans like you
are just a snack for me.</i>

1351
02:11:15,768 --> 02:11:19,262
<i>I'm the Serpent King, a vulture...
I'm disease and filth.</i>

1352
02:11:19,408 --> 02:11:22,671
<i>So what? I'm a cannibal...
I don't even spare cattle feed.</i>

1353
02:11:22,809 --> 02:11:25,996
<i>You don't scare me...
I sold the deed I made with the Devil.</i>

1354
02:11:26,136 --> 02:11:29,866
<i>Fuck your deed!
I just sold the fucking Devil himself!</i>

1355
02:11:30,005 --> 02:11:36,382
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

1356
02:11:55,158 --> 02:11:56,424
Faizal...

1357
02:12:04,244 --> 02:12:05,336
What happened?

1358
02:12:09,983 --> 02:12:11,074
Tell me...

1359
02:12:19,849 --> 02:12:22,408
You know, I never wanted to
get into father's business.

1360
02:12:24,089 --> 02:12:25,424
May I get some tea?

1361
02:12:26,327 --> 02:12:28,353
In fact, I didn't want anything.

1362
02:12:30,599 --> 02:12:32,997
How did all of this happen?

1363
02:12:34,433 --> 02:12:35,400
It's okay!

1364
02:12:37,264 --> 02:12:39,786
But you're also getting out
of this trap now... aren't you?

1365
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:44,330
Not if I win these elections...

1366
02:12:47,342 --> 02:12:49,404
...'cos then I will sink deeper.

1367
02:12:53,421 --> 02:12:58,183
Father had a chance to not
retum to Wasseypur.

1368
02:13:00,554 --> 02:13:02,018
But he came back...

1369
02:13:05,122 --> 02:13:08,888
and everone got caught
in the quicksand.

1370
02:13:09,626 --> 02:13:11,992
Enough... hey!

1371
02:13:15,972 --> 02:13:20,032
Ramadhir's story could have
ended long back...

1372
02:13:21,375 --> 02:13:23,269
with Shahid Khan.

1373
02:13:24,904 --> 02:13:27,700
But that blood bath is
still continuing!

1374
02:13:32,444 --> 02:13:34,776
I don't want any part of this.

1375
02:14:09,583 --> 02:14:13,735
<i>Whatever's wrong...</i>

1376
02:14:15,412 --> 02:14:21,842
<i>Set right whatever's wrong...</i>

1377
02:14:22,121 --> 02:14:34,435
<i>Don't lose hope,
and fight some more, my dear fool.</i>

1378
02:14:34,870 --> 02:14:39,629
12 of the total 26 polling booths
are strongly in our favour.

1379
02:14:40,169 --> 02:14:48,010
The remaining 14 will be a worr
and our main targets.

1380
02:14:48,279 --> 02:14:53,877
The voting here will be against us and
the booths will be full of armed cops.

1381
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:58,714
So first, 6 of our shortest guys will
enter the booth in burqas.

1382
02:15:02,983 --> 02:15:08,222
Meanwhile, we will open firing
in the market and distract the cops.

1383
02:15:08,761 --> 02:15:15,291
As soon as the cops leave,
you guys attack and capture the booth.

1384
02:15:23,977 --> 02:15:25,768
Give me that camera.

1385
02:15:26,204 --> 02:15:29,608
Grab the ballot boxes and run,
but only if there aren't too many civilians.

1386
02:15:29,778 --> 02:15:35,549
Or pour ink and shake the box...
or just burn it.

1387
02:15:37,055 --> 02:15:40,655
The rest of you will spread out
and riot all day with guns and bombs.

1388
02:15:46,064 --> 02:15:50,079
Terrorise all the neighbouring areas of
the polling booths...

1389
02:15:50,224 --> 02:15:53,352
so people get scared to
even step out.

1390
02:15:55,801 --> 02:15:58,600
A few of you will only keep an eye
on the Polling Offiicer.

1391
02:15:58,672 --> 02:16:03,041
When he heads towards us,
one of you will inform him:

1392
02:16:03,143 --> 02:16:05,043
"Sir, they're firing in the
market area booth"

1393
02:16:05,145 --> 02:16:08,414
The offiicer will rush to that booth
through bad roads.

1394
02:16:08,718 --> 02:16:13,670
Just as he realises he's been misinformed,
an 'injured' guy will tell him:

1395
02:16:13,948 --> 02:16:19,615
I was at the booth in the college area,
they shot us and cast our votes by force.

1396
02:16:19,956 --> 02:16:23,326
And like this, we will keep setting up
decoys and capture all 14 booths.

1397
02:16:27,901 --> 02:16:29,869
Everyone get the fuck out of here.

1398
02:16:32,304 --> 02:16:34,236
Make sure Faizal Khan
doesn't win!

1399
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:37,492
Where's Definite?
Call him.

1400
02:16:38,367 --> 02:16:39,857
Talk of the devil!

1401
02:16:41,570 --> 02:16:42,434
Hello...

1402
02:16:46,948 --> 02:16:49,075
We've just stepped out
for inspection.

1403
02:16:50,218 --> 02:16:51,412
Get there fast.

1404
02:16:52,020 --> 02:16:52,849
Okay.

1405
02:16:54,689 --> 02:16:56,523
He'll meet us at the booth.

1406
02:16:56,959 --> 02:16:57,889
Brother...

1407
02:16:59,425 --> 02:17:01,786
how about a quick visit
to the shrine first?

1408
02:17:02,156 --> 02:17:04,783
They say all prayers get
answered there.

1409
02:17:08,295 --> 02:17:09,196
Alright.

1410
02:17:14,507 --> 02:17:17,170
Does everone need to come?

1411
02:17:17,711 --> 02:17:20,077
I'm sure everone would
like to pray.

1412
02:17:20,245 --> 02:17:22,730
I think more people will
mean more time.

1413
02:17:23,373 --> 02:17:26,068
Guddu, ask the others to
stay back.

1414
02:17:30,846 --> 02:17:34,147
You guys wait at the gate.
We'll be back soon.

1415
02:18:01,816 --> 02:18:02,804
Is this it?

1416
02:18:02,917 --> 02:18:05,784
This one's for the tourists.
The real one's ahead.

1417
02:18:10,850 --> 02:18:12,607
Why are you sweating
so much?

1418
02:18:13,579 --> 02:18:16,051
It's just... this heat, brother.

1419
02:18:30,456 --> 02:18:31,615
Guddu!

1420
02:18:32,688 --> 02:18:34,447
Who the fuck shot him?

1421
02:18:47,266 --> 02:18:48,198
What the...

1422
02:18:51,442 --> 02:18:52,808
Guddu, you're shooting me...

1423
02:18:53,144 --> 02:18:54,543
Iqlakh, motherfucker!

1424
02:19:01,536 --> 02:19:03,437
Want to kill me, motherfucker?

1425
02:19:04,008 --> 02:19:05,069
Oh, I won't.

1426
02:19:05,212 --> 02:19:06,577
Then who will?

1427
02:19:11,051 --> 02:19:12,517
So who'll kill me.

1428
02:19:16,262 --> 02:19:19,629
Tell me, motherfucker...

1429
02:19:23,026 --> 02:19:23,991
Where is he?

1430
02:19:24,491 --> 02:19:25,751
They're behind the wall.

1431
02:19:43,489 --> 02:19:46,745
Come out, brother.
Nobody will kill you now.

1432
02:19:47,749 --> 02:19:50,371
Where the fuck were you, asshole?
Someone shot Guddu.

1433
02:19:50,578 --> 02:19:52,308
That was my mistake, brother.

1434
02:19:53,048 --> 02:19:57,753
Their shirts were so similar,
I shot Guddu mistaking him for Iqlakh.

1435
02:19:58,559 --> 02:20:01,289
- This was the best time to kill him.
- But who changed the plan?

1436
02:20:01,362 --> 02:20:03,353
- Ramadhir, who else!
- Let's go.

1437
02:20:03,498 --> 02:20:05,802
- He must be at the hospital..
- Lets go there..

1438
02:20:05,906 --> 02:20:10,233
- We can get him at the circuit house..
- Fuck circuit house..

1439
02:20:10,569 --> 02:20:13,587
How can he attack suddenly!
Even I need to prepare myself.

1440
02:20:13,729 --> 02:20:15,459
Watch before you shoot, bugger!

1441
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:17,537
Same shirts Guddu!

1442
02:20:21,264 --> 02:20:22,196
Faizal?

1443
02:20:27,003 --> 02:20:29,028
What the hell is this?

1444
02:20:31,413 --> 02:20:33,775
You said you were going
to quit!

1445
02:20:34,643 --> 02:20:38,296
Let me go today...
I promise I'll quit tomorrow.

1446
02:20:38,503 --> 02:20:40,367
You need to be alive to quit.

1447
02:20:41,106 --> 02:20:44,566
I swear on you,
I'll come back alive.

1448
02:20:45,146 --> 02:20:46,309
Faizal, please don't go.

1449
02:20:49,654 --> 02:20:51,087
I am pregnant.

1450
02:20:52,490 --> 02:20:55,257
Tell the baby his father
says 'hello'!

1451
02:20:55,362 --> 02:20:59,055
<i>Whatever's wrong, dear...</i>

1452
02:20:59,593 --> 02:21:03,886
<i>Whatever's wrong,
set it right, dear.</i>

1453
02:21:04,223 --> 02:21:08,597
<i>Don't lose hope,
and try to fight some more, dear.</i>

1454
02:21:08,732 --> 02:21:12,674
<i>Fight some more, my dear fool.</i>

1455
02:21:13,310 --> 02:21:17,610
<i>Whatever's wrong,
set it right, dear.</i>

1456
02:21:17,714 --> 02:21:22,049
<i>Don't lose hope,
and try to fight some more, dear.</i>

1457
02:21:22,186 --> 02:21:25,839
<i>Fight some more, my dear fool.</i>

1458
02:21:26,545 --> 02:21:31,005
<i>Don't feel frustrated, my fool...</i>

1459
02:21:31,149 --> 02:21:35,489
<i>Don't be nervous, my fool...</i>

1460
02:21:35,827 --> 02:21:40,059
<i>Don't feel frustrated, my fool...</i>

1461
02:21:40,265 --> 02:21:44,258
<i>Don't be nervous, my fool...</i>

1462
02:21:44,537 --> 02:21:49,329
<i>Don't let anything upset your mood...
anytime, my dearfool.</i>

1463
02:22:02,202 --> 02:22:03,727
Why are our guys following us?

1464
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:08,402
Hey, Guddu...

1465
02:22:12,140 --> 02:22:13,952
Tell them we don't need them.

1466
02:22:13,953 --> 02:22:15,770
But we might, brother.

1467
02:22:16,005 --> 02:22:19,032
Faizal Khan doesn't need
anyone's protection.

1468
02:22:29,091 --> 02:22:31,320
You guys don't have to cover us.

1469
02:22:31,994 --> 02:22:33,956
'Cos brother says so, fucker.

1470
02:22:39,257 --> 02:22:40,348
Gimme your phone.

1471
02:22:41,326 --> 02:22:42,884
No one will shoot...

1472
02:22:43,728 --> 02:22:46,633
...'Cos every single bullet in
Ramadhir's body will be mine.

1473
02:22:47,770 --> 02:22:50,471
They're saying another
15 days before discharge..

1474
02:23:06,450 --> 02:23:07,348
Hello!

1475
02:23:07,518 --> 02:23:09,213
Greetings, sir.

1476
02:23:09,954 --> 02:23:11,420
Faizal Khan is history.

1477
02:23:12,523 --> 02:23:15,555
But in the process
Guddu killed Iqlakh.

1478
02:23:16,166 --> 02:23:18,099
So I had to kill Guddu.

1479
02:23:18,167 --> 02:23:19,795
Where's his dead body?

1480
02:23:19,902 --> 02:23:22,420
I'm on my way to the hospital.

1481
02:23:22,630 --> 02:23:25,119
The bodies are with me
in an ambulance.

1482
02:23:31,136 --> 02:23:32,534
Yes, he's here.

1483
02:23:42,558 --> 02:23:43,854
They're in there.

1484
02:23:49,584 --> 02:23:50,513
Hello?

1485
02:24:07,111 --> 02:24:08,372
They're firing outside!

1486
02:24:12,170 --> 02:24:13,156
Hold this.

1487
02:24:15,539 --> 02:24:19,500
Stay alert!
Keep your guns handy.

1488
02:25:17,501 --> 02:25:18,490
Definite!

1489
02:31:00,950 --> 02:31:09,292
<i>Why are you tring to hold water
in your palms, fool?</i>

1490
02:31:09,831 --> 02:31:18,242
<i>Don't you know you can't hold water
in your palms, dear fool?</i>

1491
02:31:18,609 --> 02:31:26,562
<i>It's meaningless...
it's nature is to slip away.</i>

1492
02:31:27,574 --> 02:31:36,113
<i>It's time to rev that brain, you fool,
time to catch that train, you fool.</i>

1493
02:31:36,522 --> 02:31:44,826
<i>It's time to rev that brain, fool...
it's time to ignite.</i>

1494
02:31:45,296 --> 02:31:52,852
<i>Please stop your craziness
and act sane, dear fool!</i>

1495
02:31:54,029 --> 02:31:58,163
<i>Times are strange,
life is fragile...</i>

1496
02:31:58,603 --> 02:32:02,705
<i>so don't be rash, my fool.</i>

1497
02:32:03,080 --> 02:32:07,107
<i>And when life gives you
a chance, fool...</i>

1498
02:32:07,352 --> 02:32:11,613
<i>you know you shouldn't refuse!</i>

1499
02:32:11,949 --> 02:32:16,678
<i>I beg you, dear fool,
please don't refuse!</i>

1500
02:33:10,631 --> 02:33:11,921
Want some tea?

1501
02:33:11,999 --> 02:33:13,092
I'll have some.

1502
02:33:13,501 --> 02:33:14,698
Bring him outside.
