1
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:18,811
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.

2
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:21,605
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Mr. Washington.

3
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:30,906
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.

4
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:34,571
- Good morning, Bancini.
- Good morning.

5
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:44,837
How are you feeling?

6
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:46,630
Rested.

7
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:05,191
<i>Medication time.</i>

8
00:03:05,524 --> 00:03:07,318
<i>Medication time.</i>

9
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,136
Okay, move it up!

10
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:37,556
Mr. Fredrickson, here.

11
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,448
Juice.

12
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:00,830
Chief.

13
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:12,633
Okay, my friend, let's go.

14
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:37,408
Here are his papers,
and I'm going to need a signature.

15
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,591
Hi.

16
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:42,515
- Mr. McMurphy is here.
- All right.

17
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:48,145
Thank you.

18
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:00,491
All right, I'm ready.

19
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:02,493
Okay. One pair of socks.

20
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:06,789
T-shirt.

21
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:13,546
Hi.

22
00:06:17,717 --> 00:06:20,011
Goddamn, boy,
you're as big as a mountain!

23
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:22,722
Looks like you might have played
some football.

24
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,348
What's your name?

25
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:27,101
He can't hear you. He's deaf.

26
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,770
Deaf and dumb Indian.

27
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:33,107
Is that so?

28
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:35,192
Come on, Bibbit.

29
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:37,278
Can't even make a sound, huh?

30
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,614
How.

31
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:53,586
Club lead. Jack of clubs.

32
00:06:58,215 --> 00:06:59,675
What's your name, son?

33
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,135
Billy Bibbit.

34
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:04,013
Glad to know you, Bill. McMurphy's mine.

35
00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:07,933
Those are old Charlie Cheswick's cards.

36
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,811
That's his ace of spades.

37
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:13,022
Your turn, Bill.

38
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:15,274
Big ten.

39
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:20,279
- Put one of them on it, will you?
- Wait a minute.

40
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:26,202
Oh, I can win that one.

41
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:27,787
- I win.
- Oh, you overtrumped?

42
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,247
- Sure.
- Pinochle, Bill?

43
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:34,835
What's the bid?

44
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,672
$5... $5.50.

45
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:45,846
You like to look at other people's cards,
do you?

46
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,931
Yes.

47
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,225
Ever seen this one?

48
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,860
- Come on, Martini.
- Martini!

49
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:03,531
Martini, will you? Will you play a club?

50
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,537
Whose turn is it now?

51
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:10,997
Let's see, he trumped...

52
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,248
Where you going?

53
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:14,458
- Aren't you going to play?
- What's the matter?

54
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:16,919
Aren't you going to play, Martini?

55
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:19,672
Martini? I want to play.

56
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:22,049
Billy?

57
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:24,885
Billy, I want to win some...

58
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:27,722
Get a grip on yourself, will you?

59
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:31,934
Yes?

60
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:36,314
- Mr. McMurphy's here, Doc.
- Good, have him come in.

61
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:41,235
Thank you.

62
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,405
McMurphy, I'm Dr. Spivey.

63
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:46,490
Dr. Spivey, what a pleasure it is
to meet you.

64
00:08:46,574 --> 00:08:48,868
Sure. Pull up a chair,
sit down and let's talk.

65
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:49,952
Sure.

66
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,256
R.P. McMurphy.

67
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,842
That's a hell of a fish there, Doc.

68
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:06,927
- Isn't that a dandy?
- Yeah.

69
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:09,180
It's about 40 pounds, ain't it?

70
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:10,931
- No, 32.
- Thirty-two.

71
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:13,517
But I'll tell you,
it took every bit of strength I had...

72
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:15,603
...to hold it while the guy took the picture.

73
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:16,854
Every damn bit.

74
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:19,649
Probably that chain
didn't help it any, either.

75
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:21,942
You didn't weigh the chain, did you?

76
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:23,736
No, I didn't weigh the chain.

77
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:25,738
But, I'm awful proud of that picture.

78
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:28,741
That's the first Chinooker I ever caught.

79
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:30,701
It's a nice one.

80
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,251
Randall Patrick McMurphy.

81
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:41,837
38 years old.

82
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:52,390
What can you tell me about...

83
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:55,142
...why you've been sent over here?

84
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:58,312
Well...

85
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:00,356
I don't know.

86
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,358
What's it say there?

87
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:05,736
- Mind if I smoke?
- No, go right ahead.

88
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,114
Well, it...

89
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:11,367
...says several things here.

90
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:15,913
It said you've been belligerent.

91
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:19,458
Talked when unauthorized.

92
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:24,588
You've been resentful in attitude
towards work, in general. That you're lazy.

93
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:27,883
Chewing gum in class.

94
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:34,056
The real reason you've been sent here...

95
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,809
...is because they wanted you
to be evaluated.

96
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:40,021
To determine whether or not
you're mentally ill.

97
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,023
This is the real reason.

98
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:45,026
Why do you think they might think that?

99
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,407
Well, as near as I can figure out,
it's because I...

100
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,618
...fight and fuck too much.

101
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,454
In the penitentiary?

102
00:10:56,537 --> 00:10:58,122
No, you mean why...

103
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:00,708
Why did you get sent over here...

104
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,752
...from the work farm?

105
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,256
Well, I really don't know, Doc.

106
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:10,635
It says here that you went around...

107
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:13,471
- Let me just take a look...
- It ain't up to me.

108
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:14,764
One...

109
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,807
...two, three...

110
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:18,559
...four...

111
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:21,187
You've got at least...

112
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,898
...five arrests for assault.

113
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,443
What can you tell me about that?

114
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:29,153
Five fights, huh?

115
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:33,199
Rocky Marciano has 40,
and he's a millionaire.

116
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,618
- That's true.
- That is true.

117
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:40,247
Of course, it's true that you went in for...

118
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:41,332
...statutory rape.

119
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:43,417
That's true, is it not, this time?

120
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,544
Absolutely true. But, Doc...

121
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:50,383
...she was 15 years old going on 35, Doc...

122
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:53,928
...and she told me she was 18,
and she was...

123
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:56,180
...very willing, you know what I mean?

124
00:11:56,263 --> 00:11:59,141
I practically had to take
to sewing my pants shut.

125
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:02,853
But between you and me...

126
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:08,275
...she might have been 15.
When you get that little red beaver...

127
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:11,529
...right there in front of you,
I don't think it's crazy at all.

128
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:13,072
I don't think you do either.

129
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:14,699
I hear what you're saying.

130
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:18,577
No man alive could resist that.
That's why I got into jail to begin with.

131
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:20,955
Now they're telling me
I'm crazy over here...

132
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:23,708
...because I don't sit there
like a goddamn vegetable.

133
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,918
It don't make a bit of sense to me.

134
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:28,004
If that's what being crazy is...

135
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:31,757
...then I'm senseless, out of it,
gone down the road, whacko.

136
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:34,218
But, no more, no less. That's it.

137
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:37,805
To be honest with you, McMurphy...

138
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:39,765
...what it says here...

139
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:46,647
...is that they think...

140
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:48,774
They think...

141
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:52,903
...you've been faking it
in order to get out of your work detail.

142
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:58,367
- What do you think about that?
- Do I look like that kind of guy to you?

143
00:13:01,662 --> 00:13:05,458
Let's just be frank for a minute.
Randall, if you would.

144
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,793
Tell me...

145
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:11,339
Do you think there's anything
wrong with your mind, really?

146
00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:14,342
Not a thing, Doc.

147
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:17,845
I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science.

148
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:26,228
You're going to be here for a period,
for us to evaluate you.

149
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:28,606
We're going to study you.

150
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,943
We'll make our determinations
as to what we're going to do...

151
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:36,364
...and give you the necessary treatment
as indicated.

152
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,866
Doc, let me just tell you this.

153
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:41,827
I'm here to cooperate with you
100 percent.

154
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:43,996
100 percent.

155
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:47,208
I'll be just right down the line with you.
You watch.

156
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,294
Because I think we ought to get
to the bottom of...

157
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:52,713
...R.P. McMurphy.

158
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:09,063
The scythe.

159
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,736
I'm awfully tired.

160
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,821
Sit down.

161
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:18,948
- God, I'm tired.
- Sit down.

162
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:23,661
Is that better?

163
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:35,548
Mr. Ellsworth...

164
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,759
...you'll wear yourself out.

165
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:44,932
All right, gentlemen, let's begin.

166
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,603
At the close of Friday's meeting...

167
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:53,274
...we were discussing
Mr. Harding's problem concerning his wife.

168
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:58,321
Mr. Harding stated that his wife
made him uneasy...

169
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:01,365
...because she drew stares
from men on the street.

170
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,076
Is that correct, Mr. Harding?

171
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,161
Yes.

172
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,538
That's correct.

173
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,209
He also thinks he may have
given her reason...

174
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:16,213
...to seek sexual attention elsewhere,
but he wasn't able to say how.

175
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,802
Mr. Harding has been heard
to say to his wife:

176
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:23,387
"I hate you.

177
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:25,723
"I don't ever want to see you again.

178
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:27,808
"You've betrayed me."

179
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:32,563
So, does anyone care
to touch on this further?

180
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:53,042
Mr. Scanlon, would you begin today?

181
00:15:56,212 --> 00:15:57,505
Are you sure?

182
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:05,179
Billy, how about you?

183
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:09,892
No, ma'am.

184
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:13,396
I'd like to write in my book
that you began the meeting.

185
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,816
Just once.

186
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,039
Mr. Martini?

187
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,459
Are you with us?

188
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,004
Yes.

189
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,632
Would you like to begin?

190
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:53,936
Mr. Cheswick?

191
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:05,239
- Me?
- Yes.

192
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:15,249
You mean there's not a man here
who has an opinion on this matter?

193
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:21,213
All right.

194
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:23,758
Mr. Harding...

195
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,010
...you've stated on more than
one occasion...

196
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:29,013
...that you've suspected your wife
of seeing other men.

197
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:30,097
Oh, yes.

198
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:32,683
Yes, very much, I suspect her.

199
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,226
I suspect her.

200
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:36,896
Maybe you can tell us why...

201
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:38,606
...you suspect her.

202
00:17:43,694 --> 00:17:45,154
Well, I can only...

203
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:48,115
...speculate as to the reasons why.

204
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:52,662
Have you ever speculated, Mr. Harding...

205
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:55,289
...that perhaps you are...

206
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:57,541
...impatient with your wife...

207
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,670
...because she doesn't meet
your mental requirements?

208
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:06,384
Perhaps. But you see,
the only thing I can really...

209
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,511
...speculate on, Nurse Ratched...

210
00:18:08,594 --> 00:18:11,597
...is the very existence of my life...

211
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:14,308
...with or without my wife...

212
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:19,313
...in terms of the human relationships,
the juxtaposition of...

213
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:22,942
...one person to another,
the form, the content.

214
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:26,654
Harding, why don't you knock off
the bullshit and get to the point?

215
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:28,197
This is the point.

216
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:31,158
This is the point, Taber. It's not bullshit.

217
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:34,578
I'm not just talking about my wife,
I'm talking about my life!

218
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:36,664
I can't seem to get that through to you.

219
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:40,126
I'm not just talking about one person,
I'm talking about everybody!

220
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,878
I'm talking about form!
I'm talking about content!

221
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:44,922
I'm talking about interrelationships!

222
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:47,633
I'm talking about God, the Devil,
Hell, Heaven!

223
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:49,844
Do you understand? Finally?

224
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:53,973
Yeah, Harding, you're so fucking dumb
I can't believe it.

225
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,810
It makes me feel very peculiar,
very peculiar...

226
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:00,229
...when you throw in something like that.
- Why?

227
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:02,148
What does that mean, "peculiar"?

228
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:04,191
- Peculiar?
- Peculiar?

229
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,029
I'm going to tell you guys something.

230
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:10,031
You just don't want to learn anything.

231
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:12,033
You just don't want to listen to anybody.

232
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:13,701
He's got intelligence!

233
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:17,872
You've never heard the word "peculiar"?
Say, what are you trying to say?

234
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:20,333
You trying to say I'm queer? Is that it?

235
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,294
Little Mary Ann? Little Marjorie Jane?

236
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:25,379
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

237
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,798
Is that your idea
of communicating something to me?

238
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:29,383
Well, is it?

239
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:32,595
They're all crowding in on you,
Mr. Harding.

240
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:34,013
They're all ganging up on you.

241
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:35,431
Is that news?

242
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:39,769
They sometimes want to gang up
on me, too, but I...

243
00:19:39,852 --> 00:19:41,479
Cheswick, do me a favor.

244
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:42,855
Take it easy.

245
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:45,650
- And stay off my side.
- But I only want to...

246
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,443
I only want to help you.

247
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:49,612
- I understand.
- But don't you want me to...

248
00:19:49,695 --> 00:19:51,906
- Please!
- But I only want to...

249
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:54,283
- Please!
- But I only want to help you.

250
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,576
Please!

251
00:19:58,037 --> 00:19:59,163
You see...

252
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:03,042
...the other day you made some allusions,
both of you.

253
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,753
- Illusions?
- Yes, allusions.

254
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:08,130
Not illusions. Allusions...

255
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,175
...to sexual problems
I might be having with my wife.

256
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:14,553
Let's say it's true! Let's say
I know it's true, but you don't!

257
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:16,847
If that's your idea of trying
to tell me something...

258
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:20,226
You know, Harding, I think you're
some kind of morbid asshole!

259
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:21,727
- "Peculiar!"
- "Asshole" again.

260
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:23,187
It makes you feel "peculiar."

261
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,022
You've talked about your wife
ever since I can remember!

262
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:27,441
You know, she's on your mind,
and blah, blah...

263
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:28,776
I'm not talking about my wife!

264
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:31,153
When will you get that
through your thick head?

265
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:33,906
When are you going to wise up
and turn her loose?

266
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,200
- Please!
- I don't want to hear it!

267
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,619
- I'm tired.
- I don't want to hear it!

268
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:42,123
I'm tired.

269
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,916
I don't want to hear it.

270
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,584
I don't want to hear it.

271
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:47,878
It's a lot of baloney and I'm tired.

272
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:50,131
I don't want to hear it!

273
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:52,258
We know you're tired. We're all tired.

274
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:56,053
- I'm tired and it's a lot of baloney.
- You're not tired, Bancini.

275
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,974
Take your hands off me!

276
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:28,919
<i>Recreation time</i>, <i>gentlemen.</i>

277
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,671
<i>The bus is waiting.</i>

278
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:34,508
<i>All nonrestricted patients</i>
<i>please report to the bus.</i>

279
00:21:58,157 --> 00:22:00,076
Ever play this game, Chief?

280
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,540
Come on, I'll show you.

281
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,793
Old Indian game.

282
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,422
It's called "put the ball in the hole."

283
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:17,802
Now, that ought to be just...
Hold it right there.

284
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:19,470
All right.

285
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:21,681
Now, that's your spot. Don't move.

286
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:24,308
Never move. That's your spot,
you understand?

287
00:22:24,392 --> 00:22:26,644
Right there. You don't move. Now...

288
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,104
...take the ball.

289
00:22:29,063 --> 00:22:31,023
Here, take the ball.

290
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:33,985
That's it. Hold on to it.

291
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:36,946
Not too hard, Chief.
You'll crush all the air out of it.

292
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:39,615
We're gonna put her in the basket.
You understand?

293
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:42,368
All right. Now, raise up your arms.

294
00:22:43,285 --> 00:22:46,038
Raise the ball up in the air, Chief.
Raise it up.

295
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:47,081
McMurphy?

296
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:50,960
What the hell are you talking to him for?
He can't hear a fucking thing.

297
00:22:51,043 --> 00:22:54,630
I ain't talking to him.
I'm talking to myself. It helps me think.

298
00:22:54,714 --> 00:22:56,924
Yeah, well, it don't help him none.

299
00:22:57,758 --> 00:23:00,303
Well, it don't hurt him, either, does it?

300
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:02,513
Don't hurt you, does it, Chief?

301
00:23:02,972 --> 00:23:04,640
See? Don't hurt him.

302
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:09,562
All right, now, Chief.

303
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:12,690
Let's raise our hands up in the air.

304
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,191
Just raise them up.

305
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:15,776
Up, you understand?

306
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:17,528
Raise the hands up, here.

307
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:19,447
Up. Raise your hands up.

308
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:22,491
Up! That's it! That's it!
Up, all the way up.

309
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,661
All the way up. That's a baby, all right.

310
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:28,789
Okay, now...

311
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:32,877
Now, jump up in the air,
and put it in the basket, Chief.

312
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:35,087
Jump up and dunk it in!

313
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,051
Jump up in the air and stuff
that son of a bitch in there, Chief.

314
00:23:41,844 --> 00:23:43,304
Take a rest, Chief.

315
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:47,475
Just stay right there.
Take a rest. I'll be right back.

316
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:53,689
Bancini, come here for a minute.

317
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:57,068
You're looking all right.
Get right over here for a second.

318
00:23:57,151 --> 00:23:59,070
Now, just stand right there.

319
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:01,656
Just get down a little bit.
All right. Stand up.

320
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:03,407
Stand up. Go ahead.

321
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:05,618
That's a baby! All right, you got it.

322
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:07,912
All right. Now, over there.

323
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,208
Hit me, Chief! I got the moves!
I got them, Chief!

324
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,418
Hold it right there. Give me the ball.

325
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:16,796
Give me the ball. That's it.
Thank you, Chief.

326
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:17,838
Now...

327
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:19,465
...hold it right there.

328
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:22,718
You take the ball, you jump up,
and put it in the basket.

329
00:24:22,802 --> 00:24:25,763
See what I mean? Put it...
Bancini, hold still.

330
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:27,807
All right, Chief, here. Take the ball.

331
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,893
Now, jump up and put it
in the basket, Chief!

332
00:24:31,852 --> 00:24:33,688
Jump up and put it in the basket!

333
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:35,064
Not you, Bancini.

334
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:37,066
Raise up! Bancini, where you going?

335
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:38,776
I'm tired!

336
00:24:38,943 --> 00:24:41,612
Fast break! Defense! Get back!

337
00:24:43,197 --> 00:24:45,866
Come on, Bancini,
where the fuck you going at?

338
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:48,244
General, get this man around here.

339
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:49,745
That's it, back!

340
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:51,622
Over to Chief.

341
00:24:52,206 --> 00:24:55,167
Fast break! Fast break! Hit me, Chief!

342
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:56,627
Hit me, baby!

343
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,879
Put it in the basket, Chief!

344
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,257
Put it in the basket!

345
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:20,651
All right.

346
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:23,738
Make the bets.

347
00:25:24,572 --> 00:25:25,740
What's this?

348
00:25:25,906 --> 00:25:27,158
Make the bets.

349
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,909
It's a dime, Martini.

350
00:25:30,244 --> 00:25:31,662
I bet a nickel.

351
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,082
A dime is the limit, Martini.

352
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,753
I bet a dime.

353
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,885
This is not a dime, Martini.

354
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,222
This is a dime.

355
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,350
If you break it in half...

356
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:55,061
...you don't get two nickels, you get shit.

357
00:25:55,936 --> 00:25:58,147
Try and smoke it. You understand?

358
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:02,568
You don't understand!
All right, here they come.

359
00:26:02,652 --> 00:26:05,613
Queen to the Chesser,
Big Bull to Tabulations...

360
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:09,367
...ten to Billy to match his whang,
and the dealer gets a three.

361
00:26:09,992 --> 00:26:11,369
Hit me. Hit me.

362
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:15,373
I can't hit you because it ain't
your turn yet. You understand?

363
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:18,376
You see these other people?
These are the real ones.

364
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:20,378
These are real people here.

365
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:24,465
What'll you do, Ches? Hit or sit?

366
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:32,682
Hit me.

367
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:35,017
That's 23 up, Cheswick.

368
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:37,436
Taber, you're busted. Give me this.

369
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,813
Twenty-three.

370
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:41,649
- Hit me.
- Shut up!

371
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:42,733
Taber.

372
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:44,735
- Give me a dime!
- I'm next.

373
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:46,153
You're not next!

374
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:48,572
Hit me.

375
00:26:48,698 --> 00:26:50,199
- Ace.
- Hit me.

376
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:52,535
That's 4 or 14.

377
00:26:53,494 --> 00:26:55,413
Don't want any more. Billy?

378
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:57,373
- Hit me. Hit me.
- Five.

379
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:04,046
You didn't make a bet, Martini.
I can't hit you. Jesus Christ.

380
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:05,256
I bet a dime.

381
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:06,841
All right, here.

382
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:08,801
- That's 20 showing.
- No.

383
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:10,678
- Take your money.
- No.

384
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,013
It's not.

385
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:14,932
It's 10, 11, 12, 13.

386
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:19,520
This is a fucking queen here,
you understand?

387
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:22,023
You don't count the this and the this.

388
00:27:22,857 --> 00:27:23,691
Hit me.

389
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:25,735
You got 20 showing!

390
00:27:25,901 --> 00:27:27,903
Hit me again. I want another card.

391
00:27:27,987 --> 00:27:30,239
Scanlon, who's pitching the opener?

392
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:33,576
<i>Medication time.</i>

393
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:35,202
This isn't a queen!

394
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:39,373
Mac, hit me.

395
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,960
- Who's pitching the opener?
- Hit me.

396
00:27:43,044 --> 00:27:44,629
Jesus Christ Almighty!

397
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:47,048
Do you nuts want to play cards
or do you want to fucking jerk off?

398
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,299
Play the game!

399
00:27:48,382 --> 00:27:51,052
I can't even
hear myself think already, here.

400
00:28:00,102 --> 00:28:01,103
Stay back!

401
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:03,981
- Excuse me, ma'am. I just wanted to...
- Stay back!

402
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:06,233
Patients aren't allowed
in the nurses' station.

403
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,028
Well, I just wanted to turn...

404
00:28:09,195 --> 00:28:12,948
When you're outside, we'll discuss
whatever problem you have, okay?

405
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:17,119
The patients are not allowed
in the nurses' station. All right?

406
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,913
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:28:20,748 --> 00:28:23,501
Let me get in here, will you, Hard-on?
Thank you.

408
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:25,753
Excuse me, miss.

409
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,798
Do you think it might be possible
to turn the music down...

410
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:31,509
...so maybe a couple of the boys
could talk?

411
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:35,596
That music is for everyone, Mr. McMurphy.

412
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,100
I know, but do you think
we might ease it down a little...

413
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,978
...so maybe the boys didn't have to shout?

414
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:44,939
What you probably don't realize...

415
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:47,858
...is that we have a lot of old men
in this ward...

416
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:51,028
...who couldn't hear the music
if we turned it lower.

417
00:28:51,153 --> 00:28:53,280
That music is all they have.

418
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:57,118
Your hand is staining my window.

419
00:28:59,787 --> 00:29:01,789
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- All right.

420
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:05,668
Mr. McMurphy, your medication.

421
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:08,921
What's in the horse pill?

422
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:10,965
It's just medicine. It's good for you.

423
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:15,219
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of taking
something if I don't know what it is.

424
00:29:15,303 --> 00:29:17,430
Don't get upset, Mr. McMurphy.

425
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:19,807
I'm not getting upset, Miss Pilbow.

426
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:24,395
It's just that I don't want anyone
to try and slip me saltpeter.

427
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:26,856
You know what I mean?

428
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:29,442
It's all right, Nurse Pilbow.

429
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:33,112
If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want
to take his medication orally...

430
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:37,241
...I'm sure we can arrange
that he can have it some other way.

431
00:29:39,118 --> 00:29:41,829
But I don't think you'd like it,
Mr. McMurphy.

432
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,000
You'd like it, wouldn't you, Hard-on?

433
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,460
Give it to me.

434
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:49,253
Good.

435
00:29:56,469 --> 00:29:57,845
Very good!

436
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:00,723
Yummy!

437
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:06,937
Mr. Harding?

438
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:10,024
<i>Merci.</i>

439
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:24,956
Tell me, lover-boy...

440
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,750
...why didn't you tell her to go fuck herself?

441
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,716
Jesus Christ.

442
00:30:37,718 --> 00:30:39,845
Funny, huh? That's funny, huh?

443
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:43,349
You know that wasn't very smart.
She could have seen that.

444
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:50,231
God Almighty,
she's got you guys coming and going.

445
00:30:51,065 --> 00:30:53,651
What do you think she is?
Some kind of a champ or something?

446
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:55,903
No, I thought you were the champ.

447
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:58,155
You want to bet?

448
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,324
Bet on what?

449
00:31:01,283 --> 00:31:02,326
One week.

450
00:31:02,535 --> 00:31:05,288
I bet in one week I can put a bug
so far up her ass...

451
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:07,290
...she won't know whether to shit
or wind her wrist watch.

452
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:10,167
What do you say to that? Want to bet?
Do you want to bet?

453
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:12,336
One week. That's all I need.
Who wants to bet?

454
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,047
You want to bet? Bet a buck. One buck.

455
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:17,216
I'll bet.

456
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:21,595
Tabes in, one buck. Solid.

457
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:25,558
Last time we were discussing...

458
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:28,102
...Mr. Harding and the problem
with his wife...

459
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:31,022
...and I think we were making
a lot of progress.

460
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,191
So who would like to begin today?

461
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:40,906
Mr. McMurphy?

462
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,244
I've been thinking about
what you said about...

463
00:31:46,787 --> 00:31:49,415
...you know, getting things off your chest.

464
00:31:52,126 --> 00:31:55,921
Well, there's a couple of things
that I'd like to get off my chest.

465
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:58,966
Well, that's very good, Mr. McMurphy.
Go ahead.

466
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:03,971
Today, as you may or may not know,
it doesn't matter...

467
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,807
...is the opening of the World Series.

468
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:12,021
What I'd like to suggest is that
we change the work detail tonight...

469
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,857
...so that we can watch the ball game.

470
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:20,363
Well, Mr. McMurphy, what you're asking...

471
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:25,493
...is that we change
a very carefully worked-out schedule.

472
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:29,246
A little change never hurt, huh?

473
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:31,082
A little variety?

474
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:34,585
Well, it's not necessarily true,
Mr. McMurphy.

475
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:39,674
Some men on the ward take a long,
long time to get used to the schedule.

476
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:43,636
Change it now,
and they might find it very disturbing.

477
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:47,348
Fuck the schedule! They can go back
to the schedule after the Series.

478
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:50,309
I'm talking about the World Series,
Nurse Ratched.

479
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:54,647
Well, anyway, this is no way
to proceed about this.

480
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:58,109
How would it be if we had a vote...

481
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,070
...and let the majority rule?

482
00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:03,197
Great. Let's vote on it.

483
00:33:05,074 --> 00:33:07,910
So, all those in favor raise your hands.

484
00:33:12,581 --> 00:33:14,208
Okay, guys, come on.

485
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,836
Put your hands up.

486
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:23,968
What's the matter with you?
Don't you want to watch the World Series?

487
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:26,679
Get your hands up.
It can do you some good...

488
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:30,057
...to get some exercise,
putting your arms up in the air.

489
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:32,893
That's it. Come on, let's...

490
00:33:42,611 --> 00:33:44,155
What is this crap?

491
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:47,700
I watch the Series.
I haven't missed the Series in years.

492
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:51,621
Even in the cooler. When I'm in the cooler
they run it there or they'll have a riot.

493
00:33:51,704 --> 00:33:55,166
What's the matter with you guys?
Come on, be good Americans!

494
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:02,506
Well, Mr. McMurphy,
I only count three votes, and...

495
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,343
...that's not enough
to change the ward policy.

496
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:07,219
I'm sorry.

497
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:14,435
My turn. Okay, hot dice.

498
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,604
I want a ten to go...

499
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:18,689
...because I need cash.

500
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:20,941
I want to get to Mediterranean Avenue.

501
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,526
Big ten! Perfect.

502
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:23,819
Two fives.

503
00:34:27,782 --> 00:34:29,617
- What are you doing?
- Hotel.

504
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:32,536
- You do not have a hotel there.
- Hotel.

505
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,913
For the third time...

506
00:34:33,996 --> 00:34:36,457
...you do not have a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.

507
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,002
It costs $1,000 and four green houses...

508
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:42,213
...to put a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.

509
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:45,049
Play the game and knock off the bullshit.

510
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,342
Play the game.

511
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:48,094
What are you talking about? I am.

512
00:34:48,177 --> 00:34:50,262
- Play the game!
- I ain't doing anything to you!

513
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:51,639
- What bullshit?
- Your bullshit!

514
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,391
- What about your bullshit?
- Play!

515
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:55,351
- You keep your hands off me!
- Play the game!

516
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:56,769
I've had enough bullshit from you!

517
00:34:56,852 --> 00:34:58,980
- Play the game.
- What are you picking on me for?

518
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,481
Play the game, Harding.

519
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:03,234
- I'm trying to ignore you, see?
- Just play the game.

520
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:05,486
Keep your hands off me,
you son of a bitch!

521
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:07,697
Keep your hands off me! You hear me?

522
00:35:08,322 --> 00:35:11,325
- Come on, come on.
- I can be pushed just so far, see!

523
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,702
Play the game.

524
00:35:12,868 --> 00:35:15,538
You touch me once more.
Just touch me once more!

525
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:17,915
Just once more, huh? Just once more!

526
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:20,418
- Just touch me once more!
- Play the game, Harding!

527
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:22,420
Just touch me once more!

528
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:24,005
Holy Jesus!

529
00:35:42,148 --> 00:35:45,026
Is that what your schedule
does for you, Hard-on?

530
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:48,279
Goddamn lunatic!

531
00:35:48,654 --> 00:35:50,489
I don't know what you're talking about.

532
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:53,200
No? Well, then stay all wet, Harding, huh?

533
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:56,704
Because I'm going downtown
to watch the World Series, anyway.

534
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,289
Anybody want to come with me?

535
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:01,042
I do, Mac. I want to go with you!

536
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:03,210
Ches, all right. Anybody else?

537
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:06,005
- Where?
- Any bar downtown.

538
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:08,382
Mac, you can't...

539
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:10,718
...get out of here.

540
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:14,055
Anybody want to bet?

541
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:17,058
Chicken shits!

542
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:21,103
Maybe he'll just show Nurse Ratched
his big thing...

543
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:23,397
...and she'll open the door for him.

544
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:28,027
Yeah, maybe I will...

545
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:31,864
...and then maybe I'll use your
thick skull and knock a hole in the wall.

546
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:33,658
Sefelt, see?

547
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:39,246
Why? My head would squash
like an eggplant.

548
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,793
Fuck Sefelt's head,
I don't need Sefelt's head!

549
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:46,337
I'll take this thing,
and put it through the window...

550
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,131
...and me and Cheswick will go out
through the hall...

551
00:36:49,215 --> 00:36:52,259
...downtown, sit down in a bar,
wet our whistles...

552
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:54,095
...and watch the ball game.

553
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,264
And that's the bet.
Now, does anybody want any of it?

554
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,686
You're going to lift that thing?

555
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,271
Yeah! That's right.

556
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,733
I'll bet a buck.

557
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:10,611
Taber, $1.

558
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:12,822
I bet a dime.

559
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:14,323
Mac, you can't...

560
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,784
...lift that thing.

561
00:37:19,453 --> 00:37:21,831
Anybody else want any of it? Hard-on?

562
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:27,128
I'll bet $25!

563
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,881
$25, Hard-on!

564
00:37:32,675 --> 00:37:35,970
Mac, nobody could ever lift that thing.

565
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:39,348
Get out of my way, son.
You're using my oxygen.

566
00:37:39,432 --> 00:37:41,017
You know what I mean?

567
00:37:42,351 --> 00:37:43,519
All right.

568
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,938
All right.

569
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,328
Giving up?

570
00:38:03,706 --> 00:38:05,625
No! Just warming up.

571
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:07,418
Warming up.

572
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:10,588
This will be the one.

573
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,593
All right, baby.

574
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:06,519
But I tried, didn't I? Goddamn it!

575
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:08,187
At least I did that.

576
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,698
<i>And on the mound</i>, <i>the left-hander</i>,
<i>Al Downing.</i>

577
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:22,451
<i>The two pitchers still warming up</i>,
<i>right down below us.</i>

578
00:39:22,702 --> 00:39:25,538
<i>The second game of</i>
<i>the 1963 World Series...</i>

579
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:29,166
<i>... is being brought to you</i>
<i>from Yankee Stadium.</i>

580
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:36,007
Did you tell the girl
how you felt about her?

581
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:48,936
I went over to her house...

582
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:52,273
...one Sunday afternoon and...

583
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:57,320
...and I brought her some flowers...

584
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,161
...and I said:

585
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:10,750
"Celia, will you...

586
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:16,797
"...marry me?"

587
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:40,988
Why did you want to marry her?

588
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:47,244
Well, I was in love with her.

589
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,416
Your mother told me
that you never told her about it.

590
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:05,221
Why didn't you tell her about it?

591
00:41:19,652 --> 00:41:22,822
Wasn't that the first time
you tried to commit suicide?

592
00:41:31,372 --> 00:41:33,040
Oh, my God!

593
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,710
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?

594
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,878
Miss Ratched...

595
00:41:38,587 --> 00:41:41,132
...I'd like to ask you a question, please.

596
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:42,300
Go ahead.

597
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,594
Okay.

598
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:50,683
You know,
if Billy doesn't feel like talking...

599
00:41:52,226 --> 00:41:54,854
...I mean, why are you pressing him?

600
00:41:56,063 --> 00:41:58,566
Why can't we go on
to some new business?

601
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:03,154
The business of this meeting,
Mr. Cheswick...

602
00:42:03,446 --> 00:42:04,739
...is therapy.

603
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,829
You know, I don't understand this,
Miss Ratched...

604
00:42:11,912 --> 00:42:13,748
...because I don't...

605
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:15,750
Mr. McMurphy...

606
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,545
...said something yesterday
about a World Series.

607
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:22,340
A baseball game?

608
00:42:23,382 --> 00:42:26,552
You know, and I've never been
to a baseball game and...

609
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,263
...I think I'd like to see one.

610
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:34,894
That would be good therapy, too,
wouldn't it, Miss Ratched?

611
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,188
I thought we'd decided that issue.

612
00:42:40,483 --> 00:42:42,943
I don't think so, because, I mean...

613
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:45,946
...we discussed that yesterday...

614
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:49,784
...and we have a new game today,
I think, don't we, Mac?

615
00:42:50,284 --> 00:42:53,621
That's right, Ches,
and we want a new vote on it, don't we?

616
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:00,461
Would one more vote satisfy you,
Mr. McMurphy?

617
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:01,879
Yeah.

618
00:43:02,755 --> 00:43:04,173
It'll satisfy me.

619
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:08,052
There's a vote before the group.

620
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:12,223
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule,
please raise your hand.

621
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:19,230
Okay, I want to see the hands. Come on!

622
00:43:20,106 --> 00:43:22,483
Which one of you nuts has got any guts?

623
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,492
All right. That's it!

624
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,578
I only count nine votes, Mr. McMurphy.

625
00:43:35,663 --> 00:43:38,916
She only counts nine. Only nine!
It's a landslide.

626
00:43:40,376 --> 00:43:43,671
There are 18 patients
on this ward, Mr. McMurphy...

627
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:47,425
...and you have to have a majority
to change ward policy.

628
00:43:48,718 --> 00:43:51,345
So you gentlemen
can put your hands down now.

629
00:43:56,726 --> 00:43:59,895
Are you trying to tell me
that you're going to count these?

630
00:44:00,479 --> 00:44:04,358
These poor sons of bitches,
they don't know what we're talking about.

631
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:07,528
Well, I have to disagree with you,
Mr. McMurphy.

632
00:44:07,903 --> 00:44:11,532
These men are members of the ward,
just as you are.

633
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:16,787
All right. All I need is one vote, right?

634
00:44:16,912 --> 00:44:17,955
Right?

635
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:19,790
All right.

636
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,834
Okay.

637
00:44:23,419 --> 00:44:25,630
Want to watch the World Series?

638
00:44:25,755 --> 00:44:27,548
This could be a big moment for you.

639
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:29,300
You want to watch a baseball game?

640
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:30,635
You want to watch baseball?

641
00:44:30,718 --> 00:44:32,970
Just raise that hand up.
Just raise the hand up.

642
00:44:33,054 --> 00:44:35,473
- What do you say?
- I gave it all to her.

643
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:36,724
Sorry.

644
00:44:37,183 --> 00:44:39,018
Bancini, old horse.

645
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:42,104
What do you say?
You want to watch the ball game on TV?

646
00:44:42,188 --> 00:44:44,565
Want to watch the ball game?
Baseball? World Series?

647
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:46,859
What do you say, pal? You're tired?

648
00:44:47,276 --> 00:44:50,363
Just raise your hand up, Bancini.
Watch the ball game, huh?

649
00:44:50,446 --> 00:44:52,615
I'm tired. Awfully tired.

650
00:44:52,782 --> 00:44:54,241
Okay. All right.

651
00:44:54,408 --> 00:44:55,660
What about you, pal?

652
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:57,745
All we need is one vote. Just one.

653
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,830
Just your one vote. That's all we need.

654
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:03,834
Just raise your hand up and your buddies
can watch the baseball game.

655
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:12,176
General, you remember, don't you?

656
00:45:12,259 --> 00:45:14,595
October, the banner, the stars...

657
00:45:14,762 --> 00:45:17,264
"Oh, say can you"

658
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,892
The World Series.
Raise your hand up, Gen.

659
00:45:21,644 --> 00:45:23,521
Just raise your hand up.

660
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:28,484
What about you pal, huh?
Want to watch the ball game?

661
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:32,613
Want to watch the ball game, huh?
Just one vote. Just raise your...

662
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,615
Gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned.

663
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:37,410
For Christ's sake, isn't there
one of you fucking maniacs...

664
00:45:37,493 --> 00:45:38,703
...that knows what I'm talking about?

665
00:45:38,786 --> 00:45:40,037
Mr. McMurphy?

666
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,790
The meeting is adjourned.

667
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,167
Just wait a minute, will you?
Just one minute?

668
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:47,878
You can bring the subject up
again tomorrow.

669
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:49,463
All right, Chief...

670
00:45:50,423 --> 00:45:52,633
...you're our last chance. What do you say?

671
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,218
Just raise your hand up.

672
00:45:54,302 --> 00:45:56,178
That's all we need from you today, Chief.

673
00:45:56,262 --> 00:45:57,972
Just raise your hand up one time.

674
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,391
Show her that you can do it.

675
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,059
Show her that you can still do it.

676
00:46:02,143 --> 00:46:04,770
Just raise your hand up.
All the guys have got them up.

677
00:46:04,854 --> 00:46:07,565
Just raise your hand up, Chief.
Will you? Huh?

678
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:15,615
Come on, there's got to be one guy here
that's not a total fucking nut!

679
00:46:15,698 --> 00:46:16,782
Mac?

680
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:19,994
Chief! The Chief!

681
00:46:21,996 --> 00:46:24,248
Nurse Ratched? Nurse Ratched, look!

682
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:26,584
Look. The Chief put his hand up.

683
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:28,878
The Chief put his hand up. Look, he voted.

684
00:46:28,961 --> 00:46:31,839
Would you please turn
the television set on?

685
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:35,009
The Chief has got his hand up, right there.

686
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,596
The Chief voted. Now...

687
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:40,765
...will you please
turn the television set on?

688
00:46:40,848 --> 00:46:42,141
Mr. McMurphy...

689
00:46:42,224 --> 00:46:44,602
...the meeting was adjourned,
and the vote was closed.

690
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:48,356
But the vote was ten to eight.
The Chief, he's got his hand up! Look!

691
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:49,690
No, Mr. McMurphy.

692
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:53,110
When the meeting was adjourned,
the vote was nine to nine.

693
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,614
Come on,
you're not going to say that now!

694
00:46:56,697 --> 00:46:58,324
You're not going to say that now!

695
00:46:58,407 --> 00:47:00,451
You're going to pull that henhouse shit,
now, when the vote...

696
00:47:00,534 --> 00:47:02,370
The Chief just voted! It was ten to nine!

697
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:05,748
I want that television set turned on!
Right now!

698
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:12,964
Cheswick.

699
00:47:16,592 --> 00:47:18,552
- I want to watch television.
- No, you have a work assignment.

700
00:47:39,907 --> 00:47:41,075
Koufax.

701
00:47:41,742 --> 00:47:43,828
Koufax kicks. He delivers.

702
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:46,580
It's up the middle, it's a base hit.

703
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:48,749
Richardson's rounding first,
going for second!

704
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,251
The ball's into deep right center!

705
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,086
Davidson cuts the ball off!

706
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,130
Here comes the throw.
Richardson's around first!

707
00:47:54,213 --> 00:47:56,048
He slides, he's in there. It's a double!

708
00:47:56,132 --> 00:47:58,175
He's in there!
Look at Richardson, on second base.

709
00:47:58,259 --> 00:48:01,262
Koufax is in big fucking trouble!
Big trouble, baby!

710
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,597
All right, here's Tresh.
He's the next batter!

711
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,516
Tresh looks in. Koufax...

712
00:48:05,808 --> 00:48:08,769
Koufax gets the sign from Roseboro!
He kicks once, he pumps...

713
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:12,648
It's a strike! Koufax's curve ball is
snapping off like a firecracker.

714
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:14,358
Here he comes with the next pitch.

715
00:48:14,442 --> 00:48:17,945
Tresh swings!
It's a long fly ball to deep left center!

716
00:48:19,447 --> 00:48:21,949
It's going! It's gone!

717
00:48:27,288 --> 00:48:30,041
Somebody give me a fucking wiener
before I die.

718
00:48:32,752 --> 00:48:35,838
It's the great Mickey Mantle, now!
Here comes the pitch!

719
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:37,131
Mantle swings!

720
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,091
It's a fucking home run!

721
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:41,260
<i>Gentlemen</i>, <i>stop this.</i>

722
00:48:42,261 --> 00:48:43,971
<i>Stop this immediately.</i>

723
00:48:54,106 --> 00:48:55,608
Do you like it here?

724
00:48:59,987 --> 00:49:01,948
That fucking nurse, man!

725
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,451
What do you mean, sir?

726
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:16,712
She ain't honest.

727
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:24,387
Miss Ratched is one of the finest nurses
we've got in this institution.

728
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:30,601
Well, I don't want to break up
the meeting or nothing...

729
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:33,521
...but she's something of a cunt,
ain't she, Doc?

730
00:49:34,188 --> 00:49:35,773
How do you mean that?

731
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:40,069
She likes a rigged game,
you know what I mean?

732
00:49:45,741 --> 00:49:49,996
Well, you know,
I've been observing you here now...

733
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,039
...for the last four weeks...

734
00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:56,085
...and I don't see any evidence
of mental illness, at all.

735
00:49:56,335 --> 00:49:59,797
I think that you've been trying
to put us on all this time.

736
00:50:01,173 --> 00:50:03,926
You know, what do you want me to do?
You know.

737
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,471
You know what I mean? Is that it?

738
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:09,598
Is that crazy enough for you?

739
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:12,560
Want me to take a shit on the floor?
Christ!

740
00:50:14,353 --> 00:50:18,316
Have you ever heard the old saying,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss"?

741
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,818
Yeah.

742
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,405
Does that mean something to you?

743
00:50:29,368 --> 00:50:33,039
It's the same as "Don't wash
your dirty underwear in public."

744
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:36,751
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

745
00:50:38,919 --> 00:50:40,880
I'm smarter than him, ain't I?

746
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:45,760
Well that, sort of, has always meant...

747
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:50,556
...it's hard for something to grow
on something that's moving.

748
00:50:51,098 --> 00:50:53,851
How did you feel about
what happened yesterday?

749
00:50:59,482 --> 00:51:01,567
You want to kill.
You know what I mean?

750
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:13,788
Do you gentlemen have
any more questions?

751
00:51:15,957 --> 00:51:18,876
I don't have any more, but perhaps you do.

752
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,087
Do you have a question, McMurphy?

753
00:51:21,837 --> 00:51:23,965
Where do you suppose she lives?

754
00:51:55,037 --> 00:51:56,872
Chief, come on with me.

755
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:02,336
We'll show these guys who's nuts.

756
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:05,589
All right, wait.

757
00:52:06,048 --> 00:52:07,675
Stand right here.

758
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:10,845
All right. Grab the fence.

759
00:52:12,346 --> 00:52:13,848
Grab the fence here.

760
00:52:14,348 --> 00:52:16,309
Right here, Chief. Strong!

761
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:18,102
Strong, like this, here.

762
00:52:21,814 --> 00:52:23,607
That's it. All right.

763
00:52:24,317 --> 00:52:26,152
Okay. Up.

764
00:52:27,153 --> 00:52:28,362
That's it.

765
00:52:28,696 --> 00:52:30,323
All right, you got it?

766
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:37,955
All right, push!

767
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:22,124
Come on, Bob!

768
00:53:23,084 --> 00:53:24,752
Where are you going?

769
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:28,881
Don't breathe on me, Club.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

770
00:53:32,718 --> 00:53:35,304
Come on, you guys. Get the lead out, huh?

771
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,190
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

772
00:53:46,273 --> 00:53:47,566
Wait a minute!

773
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:49,777
Hold it!

774
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:51,988
See how easy it is?

775
00:54:30,151 --> 00:54:31,235
Boys.

776
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:34,238
This here is Candy.

777
00:54:34,655 --> 00:54:37,033
Candy, these are the boys.

778
00:54:52,006 --> 00:54:53,507
You all crazy?

779
00:55:19,825 --> 00:55:21,202
Let's go. Down here.

780
00:55:21,285 --> 00:55:23,496
- Isn't this wonderful?
- Down here.

781
00:55:24,914 --> 00:55:26,207
No problem.

782
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:29,794
Right here.

783
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:34,507
Come on, we don't want to be late
for our first day out.

784
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:39,929
Hello!

785
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:49,897
Come on, will you?
What are you standing around for?

786
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:52,316
Get on board. Give them these.

787
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:58,572
Hey, wait a minute!
What the heck is going on here?

788
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:00,950
What are you doing on this boat?

789
00:56:01,033 --> 00:56:02,785
We're going fishing.

790
00:56:03,035 --> 00:56:05,246
No, you're not going fishing.

791
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:08,624
Not on this boat.
You're not going fishing on this boat.

792
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:12,169
Oh, yeah, on this boat. Ask Captain Block.

793
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,131
- Captain Block?
- Captain Block. Yes, that's right.

794
00:56:15,214 --> 00:56:16,966
Who are you?

795
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:20,052
We're from the...

796
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:22,680
...State Mental Institution.

797
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:25,850
This is Dr. Cheswick...

798
00:56:26,017 --> 00:56:28,853
...Dr. Taber, Dr. Fredrickson...

799
00:56:29,061 --> 00:56:30,604
...Dr. Scanlon.

800
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,606
The famous Dr. Scanlon.

801
00:56:32,815 --> 00:56:35,109
Mr. Harding, Dr. Bibbit...

802
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:37,653
...Dr. Martini, and...

803
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,113
...Dr. Sefelt.

804
00:56:41,782 --> 00:56:43,701
How about you? Who are you?

805
00:56:43,993 --> 00:56:46,412
I'm Dr. McMurphy. R.P. McMurphy.

806
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:53,294
Wait... Wait one second.

807
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:55,338
You don't understand.
We chartered the boat.

808
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:56,922
We're going to go fishing.

809
00:56:57,006 --> 00:56:59,383
And that's all there is to it.

810
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:06,891
You better quit on this.

811
00:57:07,475 --> 00:57:09,644
They'll throw you in the can again,
you know?

812
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:11,646
No, they won't. We're nuts!

813
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,816
They'll just take us back
to the feeb farm, see?

814
00:57:17,068 --> 00:57:19,654
Von Sefelt, get the stern line.

815
00:57:20,863 --> 00:57:22,573
Tabes, you're at the bow.

816
00:57:22,698 --> 00:57:23,950
This one?

817
00:57:26,661 --> 00:57:28,913
That one! The one at your feet.

818
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:38,547
Get back on! Jesus!

819
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:42,593
Tabes!

820
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:30,099
Cheswick! Come here, quick!

821
00:58:37,106 --> 00:58:39,233
Aye, aye, sir. I mean, yes, Mac!

822
00:58:39,317 --> 00:58:42,570
Take it easy, Charlie.
Have you ever driven one of these things?

823
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:44,488
- Driven one of...
- Yeah.

824
00:58:45,364 --> 00:58:46,449
No, Mac.

825
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:49,160
Well, it's a lot of fun.

826
00:58:49,327 --> 00:58:51,746
Come on over here.
Put your hands on the wheel.

827
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:53,372
- Put your hands on.
- I never did...

828
00:58:53,456 --> 00:58:56,834
Put your hands on the wheel
so you don't fall down. All right.

829
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:59,128
Just hold it steady right there, like that.

830
00:58:59,211 --> 00:59:00,504
- Steady?
- Steady, yeah.

831
00:59:00,588 --> 00:59:02,173
Now just go straight.

832
00:59:02,256 --> 00:59:04,467
- Straight as an arrow.
- Straight, Mac?

833
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,761
- Just straight. That's right.
- But, Mac...

834
00:59:06,969 --> 00:59:09,305
Mac, this thing ain't too steady.

835
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:13,559
- Where are we going, Mac?
- Straight.

836
00:59:13,643 --> 00:59:14,977
Just go on!

837
00:59:25,488 --> 00:59:26,989
This is the bait.

838
00:59:29,492 --> 00:59:30,910
Little fishes.

839
00:59:31,118 --> 00:59:32,370
Dead fishes.

840
00:59:32,828 --> 00:59:34,080
That's right.

841
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:37,416
Now what are we going to do
with these little fishes?

842
00:59:39,293 --> 00:59:43,297
- Catch big fishes.
- That's right. That's right, Mr. Martini.

843
00:59:44,048 --> 00:59:47,093
And hooks.

844
00:59:48,135 --> 00:59:49,178
Hooks.

845
00:59:51,138 --> 00:59:53,057
Now, hold on to your hooks...

846
00:59:53,432 --> 00:59:55,434
...because here are the fishes.

847
00:59:55,935 --> 00:59:57,019
Tabes.

848
00:59:59,814 --> 01:00:01,399
Get a fish here.

849
01:00:01,857 --> 01:00:03,734
There, for you, Martini.

850
01:00:04,235 --> 01:00:07,405
All right, now we, each one of us
has got a fish.

851
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:09,615
What are you laughing at?

852
01:00:09,699 --> 01:00:11,450
You're not an idiot, huh?

853
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:14,870
You're not a goddamn looney now, boy,
you're a fisherman.

854
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,041
Now, take your bottom hook.

855
01:00:20,334 --> 01:00:21,502
You got it?

856
01:00:22,962 --> 01:00:24,213
You take it...

857
01:00:24,964 --> 01:00:26,215
...and you...

858
01:00:27,216 --> 01:00:29,218
...push it all the way through.

859
01:00:29,385 --> 01:00:30,720
Like that.

860
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,848
Wait a second.
Get it through the eyes, here.

861
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:35,433
- Right through here.
- In the eye?

862
01:00:35,516 --> 01:00:37,935
Don't worry about it! He's dead, Martini.

863
01:00:38,019 --> 01:00:41,230
Jesus Christ, just put it
through his eyeball, here.

864
01:00:41,689 --> 01:00:42,898
That's it.

865
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:46,360
Crunch it right through.
All right. Now you got it, see?

866
01:00:46,444 --> 01:00:49,697
Now, you just pull that baby through.
You see what I mean?

867
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:53,159
And you wrap it around.
You pull this so it's a little loop.

868
01:00:53,242 --> 01:00:54,410
That's very good.

869
01:00:54,493 --> 01:00:56,746
That's very good, Mr. Fredrickson!

870
01:00:56,912 --> 01:00:58,414
Very good eye work.

871
01:00:58,497 --> 01:00:59,749
Good eye work.

872
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:03,628
That little devil's going to
not even feel the sting, is he, boy?

873
01:01:04,045 --> 01:01:07,089
That son of a gun
is going to bite on you, isn't he?

874
01:01:08,049 --> 01:01:12,762
You got beautiful hair.

875
01:01:14,055 --> 01:01:15,556
Thank you.

876
01:01:19,226 --> 01:01:20,978
And you got...

877
01:01:23,773 --> 01:01:25,650
...beautiful eyes.

878
01:01:27,693 --> 01:01:29,111
Thank you.

879
01:01:31,238 --> 01:01:34,116
Billy, what's the matter?
Fishing don't grab you?

880
01:01:39,956 --> 01:01:41,624
They do.

881
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:44,543
Come on with me, over here.

882
01:01:44,627 --> 01:01:47,546
I'm going to give each
and every one of you a rod.

883
01:01:53,886 --> 01:01:54,971
All right.

884
01:01:55,221 --> 01:01:56,806
Here are your poles.

885
01:02:09,068 --> 01:02:13,114
Now, just keep watching the tip here.
If you get a strike, let me know.

886
01:02:13,531 --> 01:02:14,448
Understand?

887
01:02:14,532 --> 01:02:17,451
Come on, Candy. Just keep fishing, guys!

888
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:20,830
Don't call me unless you get
something really big...

889
01:02:20,913 --> 01:02:22,957
...you can't handle yourselves.

890
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:28,921
Keep on fishing!

891
01:02:30,506 --> 01:02:31,841
That's right.

892
01:03:04,165 --> 01:03:05,750
Where is everybody?

893
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:21,223
Cheswick! Goddamn it, I told you to...

894
01:03:21,432 --> 01:03:23,309
...steer that boat straight!

895
01:03:28,689 --> 01:03:31,317
Fish! Help, help!

896
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:35,738
Goddamn it, he's got a fish. Hold it!
Wait a minute, Tabes. I got it!

897
01:03:35,863 --> 01:03:39,367
Cheswick, get the fuck back up there!
Get up there in front!

898
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:41,535
Tabes, I got it, Tabes!

899
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:44,413
Get up, Tabes, I'll get it for you!

900
01:03:44,497 --> 01:03:47,583
Son of a bitch, he's going over here!
Get up!

901
01:03:48,084 --> 01:03:49,335
I got it!

902
01:03:53,673 --> 01:03:55,466
I got it! Give it to me!

903
01:03:55,549 --> 01:03:58,177
Hey, Harding, I'm the skipper of this boat.

904
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,428
Shut up!

905
01:03:59,512 --> 01:04:01,931
He said to go straight out as an arrow.

906
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:04,725
You're not going straight, you're kind of...

907
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:08,145
I'm going straight enough.
Now, Chessy, stop it!

908
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:10,815
- It's my duty!
- Chessy, stop it!

909
01:04:15,569 --> 01:04:17,822
No, you son of a bitch!

910
01:04:19,782 --> 01:04:22,076
All right, Martini.

911
01:04:22,451 --> 01:04:24,412
All right, take him over!

912
01:04:24,704 --> 01:04:26,038
Take him over!

913
01:04:26,622 --> 01:04:28,749
That's it! Now play them, boys!

914
01:04:29,959 --> 01:04:31,919
You sons of bitches!

915
01:04:33,254 --> 01:04:34,964
Keep it straight!

916
01:04:35,798 --> 01:04:37,466
Come back this way!

917
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:12,585
Home safe and sound. Didn't lose a nut!

918
01:05:12,668 --> 01:05:14,879
Beats bowling, you know what I mean?

919
01:05:17,298 --> 01:05:18,424
We caught it, look!

920
01:05:18,507 --> 01:05:22,762
They're going to be trolling this place
for six months looking for dead bodies!

921
01:05:30,811 --> 01:05:32,521
I think he's dangerous.

922
01:05:32,855 --> 01:05:34,357
He's not crazy...

923
01:05:34,857 --> 01:05:36,442
...but he's dangerous.

924
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:38,152
You don't think he's crazy?

925
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:39,946
No, he's not crazy.

926
01:05:42,531 --> 01:05:43,866
Dr. Songee?

927
01:05:44,742 --> 01:05:47,036
I don't think he's overly psychotic.

928
01:05:48,329 --> 01:05:50,539
But I still think he's quite sick.

929
01:05:51,123 --> 01:05:53,751
- Do you think he's dangerous?
- Absolutely so.

930
01:05:56,712 --> 01:05:59,298
Well, John, what do you want
to do with him?

931
01:06:02,677 --> 01:06:04,637
I think we've had our turn.

932
01:06:05,888 --> 01:06:09,225
I'd like to send him back
to the work farm, frankly.

933
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:13,896
Is there anybody that you have...

934
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:16,232
...on your staff, that could...

935
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:19,110
...relate to him? Maybe understand him.

936
01:06:19,402 --> 01:06:21,904
Help him out
with some of these problems?

937
01:06:22,321 --> 01:06:25,324
The funny thing is that
the person he's the closest to...

938
01:06:25,408 --> 01:06:27,618
...is the one he dislikes the most.

939
01:06:28,577 --> 01:06:30,079
That's you, Mildred.

940
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:34,792
Well, gentlemen, in my opinion,
if we send him back to Pendleton or...

941
01:06:35,584 --> 01:06:37,712
...we send him up to Disturbed...

942
01:06:37,878 --> 01:06:42,383
...it's just one more way of passing on
our problem to somebody else.

943
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:45,469
You know, we don't like to do that.

944
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:49,682
So I'd like to keep him on the ward.

945
01:06:51,267 --> 01:06:53,102
I think we can help him.

946
01:06:58,149 --> 01:07:00,776
Chief, Chief, come on.

947
01:07:01,152 --> 01:07:02,570
Come with me, huh?

948
01:07:04,614 --> 01:07:06,657
Chief, this is the spot.

949
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,369
Right there is the spot. Remember?

950
01:07:10,786 --> 01:07:13,039
Raise the hands, in the basket.

951
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:15,249
That's it. Raise the hands up.

952
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:19,253
All right! Let's have a little ball
from you nuts in here! Here we go!

953
01:07:19,337 --> 01:07:22,381
All right! Let's play ball, nuts.
Let's make some moves!

954
01:07:22,465 --> 01:07:24,467
Hey, Mac. Time, time.

955
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:26,636
You've got six men on the court.

956
01:07:28,012 --> 01:07:30,181
Harding, out of the ball game.

957
01:07:31,641 --> 01:07:32,933
Hey, why me?

958
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:35,519
Because I'm the coach. I'll put you in later.

959
01:07:35,603 --> 01:07:37,021
I don't trust you.

960
01:07:40,441 --> 01:07:41,567
I'll go.

961
01:07:42,068 --> 01:07:45,613
Okay, good boy, Billy.
I'll put you in in a minute, all right?

962
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,034
Let's play ball. Harding, break over there.

963
01:07:50,117 --> 01:07:51,702
All right, Martini, get it back.

964
01:07:51,786 --> 01:07:53,454
I'm in the open! What're you doing?

965
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:55,581
You threw the goddamn ball
into the fence!

966
01:07:55,665 --> 01:07:58,209
Christ Almighty, you threw it
into the fence!

967
01:07:58,292 --> 01:08:00,544
There's nobody there! We're playing ball!

968
01:08:00,628 --> 01:08:04,799
All right, come on, get in the game.
Defense, nobody's doing nothing here!

969
01:08:05,132 --> 01:08:07,551
- For Christ's sake!
- Hey, Mac, I'm open!

970
01:08:07,635 --> 01:08:10,304
Harding, give it back.
Back to me, Harding! Here.

971
01:08:10,388 --> 01:08:12,431
I'm open. Will you give me the ball?

972
01:08:12,515 --> 01:08:14,767
- Stop dribbling the goddamn ball!
- I got it!

973
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:16,394
Harding, over here.

974
01:08:17,186 --> 01:08:19,397
Oh, for Christ's sake. I'm standing...

975
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,940
- You were covered!
- I was open!

976
01:08:21,023 --> 01:08:23,776
Just give me the ball.
They're making all over the...

977
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:25,820
I was open. Give me the ball.

978
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:30,116
- You were covered, Mac.
- I wasn't covered. Somebody get back!

979
01:08:31,117 --> 01:08:33,160
Give it to me! Give it to me!

980
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:37,415
Chief! Atta baby, put it in!

981
01:08:42,503 --> 01:08:44,505
Get down there!

982
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,636
Get down there, Chief! All right, all right.

983
01:08:53,597 --> 01:08:55,141
Get around, Chief!

984
01:08:58,686 --> 01:09:01,314
No, no, no. Get down there, Chief!

985
01:09:01,522 --> 01:09:03,899
The ball's in play! Ball's in play!

986
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:06,902
- That's bullshit!
- Ball's in play.

987
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:10,239
Oh, fuck that shit! You've got to be crazy.

988
01:09:10,323 --> 01:09:12,950
Man, that doesn't go!
That ball ain't in play!

989
01:09:14,702 --> 01:09:17,079
Come on, Chief! Put it in!

990
01:09:26,922 --> 01:09:28,424
What a ball club!

991
01:09:56,911 --> 01:09:59,288
McMurphy, get off the side.

992
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:02,792
- Come on, move it, man!
- Hey, damn it!

993
01:10:02,959 --> 01:10:05,044
Quick! Come on, go ahead.

994
01:10:06,963 --> 01:10:08,381
Go ahead.

995
01:10:10,132 --> 01:10:11,509
Go ahead.

996
01:10:12,301 --> 01:10:15,471
I'll be seeing you on the outside.
You know what I mean?

997
01:10:16,472 --> 01:10:18,599
By the time you get out of here...

998
01:10:18,724 --> 01:10:20,893
...you'll be too old to even get it up.

999
01:10:20,977 --> 01:10:23,020
Sixty-eight days, buddy.

1000
01:10:23,437 --> 01:10:24,981
Sixty-eight days.

1001
01:10:25,106 --> 01:10:27,900
What the fuck you talking about, 68 days!

1002
01:10:28,109 --> 01:10:29,986
That's in jail, sucker.

1003
01:10:30,861 --> 01:10:33,155
You still don't know where you're at?

1004
01:10:33,948 --> 01:10:36,200
Yeah, where am I at, Washington?

1005
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,452
With us, baby, you're with us.

1006
01:10:38,536 --> 01:10:41,747
And you're going to stay with us
until we let you go.

1007
01:10:50,381 --> 01:10:53,592
Do you want to say something
to the group, Mr. McMurphy?

1008
01:10:59,056 --> 01:11:03,185
I'd like to know why none of the guys
never told me that you...

1009
01:11:04,186 --> 01:11:05,605
...Miss Ratched...

1010
01:11:05,896 --> 01:11:10,443
...and the doctors could keep me here till
you're good and ready to turn me loose.

1011
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:13,779
That's what I'd like to know.

1012
01:11:13,988 --> 01:11:16,324
Fine, Randall, that's a good start.

1013
01:11:17,116 --> 01:11:19,660
Would anyone care
to answer Mr. McMurphy?

1014
01:11:22,163 --> 01:11:23,414
Answer what?

1015
01:11:23,873 --> 01:11:25,499
You heard me, Harding.

1016
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:28,419
You let me go on hassling
Nurse Ratched here...

1017
01:11:28,502 --> 01:11:32,131
...knowing how much I had to lose
and you never told me nothing!

1018
01:11:32,548 --> 01:11:34,342
Now, Mac, wait a minute.

1019
01:11:34,508 --> 01:11:37,053
Wait a minute, I didn't know anything
about how much...

1020
01:11:37,136 --> 01:11:39,180
- Shit!
- Wait a minute. Listen.

1021
01:11:40,056 --> 01:11:40,973
Now, look...

1022
01:11:41,057 --> 01:11:43,643
I'm voluntary here, see?
I'm not committed.

1023
01:11:45,895 --> 01:11:49,523
I don't have to stay here.
I mean, I can go home anytime I want.

1024
01:11:50,733 --> 01:11:52,860
You can go home anytime you want?

1025
01:11:53,152 --> 01:11:55,321
- That's it.
- You're bullshitting me!

1026
01:11:55,738 --> 01:11:57,698
He's bullshitting me, right?

1027
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:00,493
No, Randall, he's telling you the truth.

1028
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:05,915
As a matter of fact, there are
very few men here who are committed.

1029
01:12:06,207 --> 01:12:07,708
There's Mr. Bromden.

1030
01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:09,627
Mr. Taber.

1031
01:12:10,503 --> 01:12:12,546
Some of the chronics, and you.

1032
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:20,721
Cheswick?

1033
01:12:21,722 --> 01:12:23,265
You're voluntary?

1034
01:12:28,562 --> 01:12:29,814
Scanlon?

1035
01:12:34,026 --> 01:12:37,196
Billy, for Christ's sake,
you must be committed, right?

1036
01:12:37,321 --> 01:12:38,948
No, no, no.

1037
01:12:43,536 --> 01:12:44,912
You're just a young kid!

1038
01:12:44,996 --> 01:12:48,082
What're you doing here?
You ought to be out in a convertible...

1039
01:12:48,165 --> 01:12:50,167
...bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver.

1040
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:52,712
What are you doing here, for Christ's sake?

1041
01:12:52,795 --> 01:12:54,630
What's so funny about that?

1042
01:12:56,257 --> 01:12:59,719
Jesus, I mean, you guys do nothing
but complain about how you can't...

1043
01:12:59,802 --> 01:13:03,514
...stand it in this place, and then
you haven't got the guts to walk out?

1044
01:13:03,597 --> 01:13:07,351
What do you think you are,
for Christ's sake? Crazy or something?

1045
01:13:08,936 --> 01:13:11,272
Well, you're not. You're not!

1046
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:14,692
No crazier than the average asshole
walking around on the streets.

1047
01:13:14,775 --> 01:13:16,110
And that's it.

1048
01:13:16,944 --> 01:13:19,447
Jesus Christ, I can't believe it!

1049
01:13:24,827 --> 01:13:28,122
Those are very challenging observations
you made, Randall.

1050
01:13:30,207 --> 01:13:32,960
I'm sure some of the men
would like to comment.

1051
01:13:36,797 --> 01:13:38,049
Mr. Scanlon?

1052
01:13:39,884 --> 01:13:44,347
I want to know why the dorm is locked
in the daytime and on weekends.

1053
01:13:50,895 --> 01:13:53,481
I would like to know about our cigarettes.

1054
01:13:55,775 --> 01:13:58,486
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

1055
01:13:58,903 --> 01:14:01,656
You sit down, Mr. Cheswick,
and wait your turn.

1056
01:14:05,201 --> 01:14:06,661
Go ahead, sit down!

1057
01:14:14,627 --> 01:14:17,755
To answer your question
about the dorm, Mr. Scanlon.

1058
01:14:18,339 --> 01:14:19,674
You know very well...

1059
01:14:19,757 --> 01:14:24,261
...that if we left the door open, you'd just
go right back to bed after breakfast.

1060
01:14:24,387 --> 01:14:25,721
Am I right?

1061
01:14:26,222 --> 01:14:27,431
So what?

1062
01:14:28,724 --> 01:14:31,060
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

1063
01:14:31,143 --> 01:14:32,853
Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick.

1064
01:14:32,937 --> 01:14:35,648
Cigarettes are not important.
Sit down, will you?

1065
01:14:35,731 --> 01:14:37,149
For Christ's sake!

1066
01:14:40,528 --> 01:14:41,737
Cigarettes!

1067
01:14:45,032 --> 01:14:48,035
Remember, Mr. Scanlon,
we've discussed many times...

1068
01:14:48,369 --> 01:14:52,123
...that time spent in the company
of others is very therapeutic.

1069
01:14:52,915 --> 01:14:56,961
While time spent brooding alone
only increases a feeling of separation.

1070
01:14:57,503 --> 01:14:59,171
You remember that, don't you?

1071
01:14:59,255 --> 01:15:00,840
Do you mean to say...

1072
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:04,218
...it's sick to want to be off by yourself?

1073
01:15:04,343 --> 01:15:05,553
Miss Ratched?

1074
01:15:07,305 --> 01:15:10,474
Mr. Cheswick, you sit down!

1075
01:15:10,558 --> 01:15:12,977
- I want to know about...
- Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.

1076
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:14,353
I want to...

1077
01:15:15,146 --> 01:15:17,273
Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding?

1078
01:15:17,356 --> 01:15:18,899
It's my last one.

1079
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:22,987
That's a fucking lie.
Why don't you give him a cigarette?

1080
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:25,531
Look, I'm not running a charity ward, see?

1081
01:15:25,615 --> 01:15:26,824
Come on!

1082
01:15:26,907 --> 01:15:29,201
Look, I don't want his cigarettes.

1083
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:31,996
And I don't want his, or his, or his...

1084
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:35,291
...or his, or his, or his...

1085
01:15:35,666 --> 01:15:37,168
Or even yours.

1086
01:15:37,251 --> 01:15:38,961
Do you understand that?

1087
01:15:39,128 --> 01:15:41,881
I want my cigarettes, Miss Ratched!

1088
01:15:42,089 --> 01:15:44,133
I want my cigarettes!

1089
01:15:44,342 --> 01:15:46,761
I want mine, Miss Ratched!

1090
01:15:46,927 --> 01:15:49,180
What gives you the damn right...

1091
01:15:49,347 --> 01:15:52,975
...to keep our cigarettes
piled up on your desk...

1092
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,854
...and to squeeze out a pack
only when you feel like it, huh?

1093
01:15:58,773 --> 01:16:01,275
- Miss Ratched!
- Mr. Harding!

1094
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,404
Oh, I'm sorry.

1095
01:16:05,488 --> 01:16:08,199
- You surprise me.
- I lost my head. I'm sorry.

1096
01:16:08,324 --> 01:16:10,034
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

1097
01:16:10,117 --> 01:16:12,411
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.

1098
01:16:12,495 --> 01:16:15,706
I didn't mean to.
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.

1099
01:16:15,957 --> 01:16:17,249
It's all right.

1100
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,001
Miss Ratched!

1101
01:16:19,961 --> 01:16:21,379
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?

1102
01:16:21,629 --> 01:16:23,881
I asked you a question!

1103
01:16:24,423 --> 01:16:26,759
I heard your question, Mr. Cheswick...

1104
01:16:27,468 --> 01:16:31,138
...and I will answer your question
as soon as you've calmed down.

1105
01:16:35,643 --> 01:16:37,645
Are you calm, Mr. Cheswick?

1106
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:39,855
- I'm calm.
- Good.

1107
01:16:42,024 --> 01:16:45,069
Now, as you all know, Mr. McMurphy...

1108
01:16:45,152 --> 01:16:48,572
...has been running
a small gambling casino in our tub room.

1109
01:16:49,907 --> 01:16:53,369
Now, most of you lost
all your cigarettes to Mr. McMurphy...

1110
01:16:53,703 --> 01:16:57,039
...not to mention a tidy sum of money
to Mr. McMurphy.

1111
01:16:58,499 --> 01:16:59,875
And that's why...

1112
01:17:00,042 --> 01:17:03,004
...your tub room privileges
have been suspended...

1113
01:17:03,587 --> 01:17:06,132
...and your cigarettes have been rationed.

1114
01:17:09,677 --> 01:17:10,928
Mr. Martini?

1115
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,349
How are we going to win our money back?

1116
01:17:19,854 --> 01:17:23,149
You're not going to win
your money back, Mr. Martini.

1117
01:17:23,357 --> 01:17:24,692
That's all over.

1118
01:17:25,151 --> 01:17:27,445
If you had obeyed the rules
in the first place...

1119
01:17:27,528 --> 01:17:29,864
...you wouldn't have lost your money.

1120
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,376
Sit down, gentlemen!
Sit down, gentlemen! Sit down!

1121
01:17:49,133 --> 01:17:50,134
Rules?

1122
01:17:50,217 --> 01:17:53,054
Piss on your fucking rules, Miss Ratched!

1123
01:17:53,137 --> 01:17:54,513
Sit down. Will you?

1124
01:17:54,597 --> 01:17:57,558
I want you to know something
right here and now!

1125
01:17:57,642 --> 01:18:00,978
- I ain't no little kid! I ain't no little kid!
- You sit down!

1126
01:18:01,062 --> 01:18:04,273
What, are you going to have
cigarettes kept from me like cookies?

1127
01:18:04,357 --> 01:18:06,943
And I want something done!
Ain't that right, Mac?

1128
01:18:07,026 --> 01:18:08,819
That's right! Will you sit down?

1129
01:18:08,903 --> 01:18:11,322
No, I won't! I won't!

1130
01:18:11,405 --> 01:18:13,240
I want something done!

1131
01:18:13,324 --> 01:18:15,534
- Sit down!
- I want something done!

1132
01:18:15,618 --> 01:18:17,620
I want something done!

1133
01:18:17,745 --> 01:18:19,121
I want something done!

1134
01:18:19,205 --> 01:18:21,374
I want something done!

1135
01:18:21,749 --> 01:18:24,669
I want something done!

1136
01:18:25,711 --> 01:18:27,713
- Here!
- I want something done!

1137
01:18:27,797 --> 01:18:29,632
Goddamn it, Cheswick, here!

1138
01:18:29,715 --> 01:18:31,467
Hey, calm down!

1139
01:18:31,592 --> 01:18:35,596
Why don't you leave him alone,
Washington? He's going to be all right!

1140
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:46,565
Emergency 34-B.

1141
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:52,363
I'll break your fucking wrist!

1142
01:18:59,287 --> 01:19:02,373
Forget it, Mac! It's all over, McMurphy!

1143
01:19:04,792 --> 01:19:06,085
Warren!

1144
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:48,461
Would you move, please?
We need this chair.

1145
01:19:48,544 --> 01:19:50,671
Just move right over there, okay.

1146
01:19:54,675 --> 01:19:58,054
I see we have Mr. Bromden back.
Yeah, okay.

1147
01:20:01,932 --> 01:20:04,644
- How do you do, Mr. McMurphy?
- I do real fine.

1148
01:20:05,144 --> 01:20:07,605
I know you didn't do anything wrong.
Just sit.

1149
01:20:07,688 --> 01:20:09,815
We're not going to hurt you.
Sit down, here.

1150
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:10,942
That's it.

1151
01:20:11,025 --> 01:20:13,569
Nurse, this is Mr. Cheswick.
He's a little upset.

1152
01:20:13,653 --> 01:20:15,863
Okay, fine. Thank you very much.

1153
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:18,282
- You'll be okay, Mr. Cheswick.
- Yes.

1154
01:20:18,366 --> 01:20:20,826
Would you keep an eye on these three?

1155
01:21:11,752 --> 01:21:14,213
Would you please take these, gentlemen?

1156
01:21:14,672 --> 01:21:16,382
He can't hear nothing.

1157
01:21:24,348 --> 01:21:26,475
Calm down, Ches, will you?

1158
01:21:26,559 --> 01:21:29,061
Mr. Cheswick,
would you please follow me?

1159
01:21:31,897 --> 01:21:33,274
Mr. Cheswick?

1160
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,365
- No!
- Nobody's gonna hurt you, come on.

1161
01:21:41,449 --> 01:21:43,826
- No!
- It'll be all right.

1162
01:21:44,493 --> 01:21:45,995
No one's going to hurt you.

1163
01:21:46,078 --> 01:21:47,371
No, leave me alone!

1164
01:21:47,455 --> 01:21:49,498
- Take it easy on yourself. Come on!
- No! Mac!

1165
01:21:49,582 --> 01:21:51,417
Mac! Mac!

1166
01:21:52,251 --> 01:21:53,169
No!

1167
01:21:53,669 --> 01:21:56,130
Come on. Come on, now. Come on.

1168
01:21:56,756 --> 01:21:58,174
- Come on.
- No!

1169
01:21:58,341 --> 01:22:00,343
I didn't do nothing!

1170
01:22:00,926 --> 01:22:01,844
Mac!

1171
01:22:03,596 --> 01:22:06,724
- Come on.
- I won't go! I don't want to go!

1172
01:22:28,871 --> 01:22:30,456
Want some gum?

1173
01:22:34,627 --> 01:22:35,920
Thank you.

1174
01:22:58,401 --> 01:22:59,694
Juicy Fruit.

1175
01:23:02,947 --> 01:23:06,075
You sly son of a bitch, Chief.

1176
01:23:09,954 --> 01:23:11,831
Can you hear me, too?

1177
01:23:12,248 --> 01:23:13,749
Yeah, you bet!

1178
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:17,128
Well, I'll be goddamned, Chief!

1179
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:22,842
And they all, they all think
you're deaf and dumb.

1180
01:23:24,844 --> 01:23:26,887
Jesus Christ!

1181
01:23:28,389 --> 01:23:30,182
You fooled them, Chief.

1182
01:23:31,183 --> 01:23:33,352
You fooled them. You fooled them all!

1183
01:23:33,436 --> 01:23:34,770
Goddamn!

1184
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:41,319
What are we doing in here, Chief?

1185
01:23:43,362 --> 01:23:46,240
What's us two guys
doing in this fucking place?

1186
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,666
Let's get out of here.

1187
01:23:57,418 --> 01:23:58,419
Out.

1188
01:24:03,633 --> 01:24:04,675
Canada?

1189
01:24:05,926 --> 01:24:06,927
Canada.

1190
01:24:07,386 --> 01:24:10,973
We'll be there before these
sons of bitches know what hit them.

1191
01:24:13,351 --> 01:24:15,311
Listen to Randall on this one.

1192
01:24:36,749 --> 01:24:38,084
Mr. McMurphy?

1193
01:24:39,585 --> 01:24:41,003
Please follow me.

1194
01:24:45,675 --> 01:24:47,343
You and me, Chief.

1195
01:24:59,855 --> 01:25:02,191
Take a cigarette break, boys. Easy.

1196
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,321
I'll be fine.

1197
01:25:15,079 --> 01:25:16,664
Would you sit up, please?

1198
01:25:16,747 --> 01:25:18,499
- I'd love to.
- Atta boy.

1199
01:25:18,666 --> 01:25:22,503
There might be a little fluid in them boots,
you know what I mean, boys?

1200
01:25:22,586 --> 01:25:24,088
Just a little leak.

1201
01:25:24,672 --> 01:25:26,465
A light shine, boys, and...

1202
01:25:26,674 --> 01:25:29,051
...send the specimen to Nurse Ratched.

1203
01:25:38,019 --> 01:25:39,770
All right, out with your gum.

1204
01:25:39,854 --> 01:25:41,439
Out with your gum.

1205
01:25:45,818 --> 01:25:49,155
Okay, this won't hurt,
and it'll be over in just a moment.

1206
01:25:49,363 --> 01:25:51,073
- What's that?
- Conductant.

1207
01:25:51,657 --> 01:25:53,367
A little dab will do you.

1208
01:25:53,743 --> 01:25:55,494
Right, Mr. Jackson?

1209
01:25:56,495 --> 01:25:57,830
Open your mouth.

1210
01:25:58,706 --> 01:26:01,542
- What's that?
- This'll keep you from biting your tongue.

1211
01:26:01,626 --> 01:26:03,336
Now just bite down on it.

1212
01:26:04,045 --> 01:26:06,130
That's right. Just bite down.

1213
01:26:06,213 --> 01:26:07,798
Now, bite down on it.

1214
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:15,723
Are you ready?

1215
01:26:19,018 --> 01:26:20,353
Here we go.

1216
01:26:51,258 --> 01:26:53,386
Now, one big breath.

1217
01:26:58,516 --> 01:26:59,767
Very good.

1218
01:27:03,104 --> 01:27:06,691
Gentlemen, I'd like to begin today.
It shouldn't take too long.

1219
01:27:09,026 --> 01:27:10,111
Jim?

1220
01:27:10,611 --> 01:27:12,405
It's been brought to my attention...

1221
01:27:12,488 --> 01:27:15,825
...that you've been giving Mr. Fredrickson
your medication.

1222
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:17,285
Is that true?

1223
01:27:22,999 --> 01:27:24,333
No, ma'am.

1224
01:27:25,918 --> 01:27:26,919
Jim?

1225
01:27:27,628 --> 01:27:30,673
Are you giving your medication
to Mr. Fredrickson...

1226
01:27:30,965 --> 01:27:32,425
...or are you not?

1227
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:10,504
How about it, you creeps,
you lunatics, mental defectives.

1228
01:28:10,588 --> 01:28:14,800
Let's hear it for Bullgoose Randall,
back in action. Nice shirt, Cheseroo.

1229
01:28:18,137 --> 01:28:19,889
Look at the faces on you!

1230
01:28:20,348 --> 01:28:21,974
Look at you!

1231
01:28:23,017 --> 01:28:25,561
The feeb's brigade, you ding-a-lings!

1232
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:29,148
The mental defective league in formation.

1233
01:28:30,983 --> 01:28:33,861
How are you, Nurse Ratched?
I'm happy to be back.

1234
01:28:34,362 --> 01:28:36,739
We're happy to have you back, Randall.

1235
01:28:36,948 --> 01:28:38,032
Thank you.

1236
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:42,662
Would you like to rest today,
or would you like to join the group?

1237
01:28:43,871 --> 01:28:45,873
I'd love to join the group.

1238
01:28:46,332 --> 01:28:47,541
I'd like...

1239
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:50,211
I'm proud to join the group, Mildred.

1240
01:28:51,295 --> 01:28:53,547
How's it going, Mac?

1241
01:28:53,714 --> 01:28:55,841
Perfect, Billy boy, absolutely perfect.

1242
01:28:55,925 --> 01:28:59,387
They were giving me 10,000 watts a day,
you know, and I'm...

1243
01:28:59,553 --> 01:29:00,763
...hot to trot.

1244
01:29:00,846 --> 01:29:03,933
The next woman who takes me on
will light up like a pinball machine...

1245
01:29:04,016 --> 01:29:06,185
...and pay off in silver dollars!

1246
01:29:10,398 --> 01:29:12,066
That's an amusing thought, Randall...

1247
01:29:12,149 --> 01:29:14,902
...but when you came in
we were talking to Jim.

1248
01:29:15,403 --> 01:29:17,780
He has a problem with his medication...

1249
01:29:18,072 --> 01:29:19,824
...and we'd like to get back to that.

1250
01:29:19,907 --> 01:29:23,411
Oh, I don't mind at all,
Nurse Ratched, I'm...

1251
01:29:24,287 --> 01:29:26,497
...as gentle as a puppy dog.

1252
01:29:27,123 --> 01:29:28,916
Please proceed. Thank you.

1253
01:29:30,459 --> 01:29:33,838
<i>The administration was hopeful</i>,
<i>but cautious Friday in its reaction...</i>

1254
01:29:34,505 --> 01:29:36,924
<i>... to a possible opening of the Berlin Wall...</i>

1255
01:29:37,008 --> 01:29:39,510
<i>... during the upcoming Christmas holiday.</i>

1256
01:29:40,886 --> 01:29:43,681
<i>Good night</i>, <i>gentlemen.</i>
<i>See you in the morning.</i>

1257
01:31:09,767 --> 01:31:11,310
Yeah, baby, it's Mac.

1258
01:31:11,852 --> 01:31:13,271
It's on tonight.

1259
01:31:13,396 --> 01:31:14,897
Don't worry about it.

1260
01:31:14,981 --> 01:31:17,108
Don't worry about it. Get a car.

1261
01:31:18,025 --> 01:31:21,028
I don't give a shit, baby.
Steal it if you have to!

1262
01:31:21,862 --> 01:31:23,531
I have to go! I have to go!

1263
01:31:24,031 --> 01:31:25,825
Don't forget to bring some booze.

1264
01:31:25,908 --> 01:31:27,868
Right. 'Bye.

1265
01:32:21,631 --> 01:32:23,633
Chief, I can't take it no more.

1266
01:32:25,426 --> 01:32:27,094
I have to get out of here.

1267
01:32:31,807 --> 01:32:33,935
I can't. I just can't.

1268
01:32:35,811 --> 01:32:37,980
It's easier than you think, Chief.

1269
01:32:39,565 --> 01:32:42,234
For you, maybe.
You're a lot bigger than me.

1270
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:48,282
Why, Chief, you're about as big
as a goddamn tree trunk.

1271
01:32:54,455 --> 01:32:56,165
My poppa's real big.

1272
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:59,627
He did like he pleased.

1273
01:33:00,753 --> 01:33:02,964
That's why everybody worked on him.

1274
01:33:06,133 --> 01:33:10,346
The last time I've seen my father
he was blind in the cedars from drinking.

1275
01:33:11,472 --> 01:33:14,267
And every time he put
the bottle to his mouth...

1276
01:33:14,392 --> 01:33:16,185
...he don't suck out of it.

1277
01:33:16,727 --> 01:33:19,355
It sucks out of him until he'd shrunk so...

1278
01:33:20,481 --> 01:33:23,567
...wrinkled and yellow,
even the dogs don't know him.

1279
01:33:25,111 --> 01:33:26,570
Killed him, huh?

1280
01:33:28,906 --> 01:33:30,908
I'm not saying they killed him.

1281
01:33:31,659 --> 01:33:35,371
They just worked on him,
the way they're working on you.

1282
01:33:44,505 --> 01:33:46,132
There they are, Chief.

1283
01:33:46,841 --> 01:33:48,843
There they are. They're here.

1284
01:34:03,691 --> 01:34:05,318
Over here. That's it!

1285
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:07,778
McMurphy, stop all this holy roller shit...

1286
01:34:07,862 --> 01:34:10,865
...and get your ass back in bed.
Do you understand?

1287
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,578
My prayers have been answered, Turkle.

1288
01:34:16,078 --> 01:34:17,747
Come on and see.

1289
01:34:26,297 --> 01:34:28,591
You'd take $20...

1290
01:34:28,716 --> 01:34:32,178
...to get down on your knees and pray,
wouldn't you, Turkle?

1291
01:34:33,054 --> 01:34:35,014
No, it don't send me, don't send me.

1292
01:34:35,097 --> 01:34:36,807
- It don't?
- Don't do nothing to me, no.

1293
01:34:36,891 --> 01:34:38,935
Well, you know there'll be more.

1294
01:34:41,228 --> 01:34:44,982
I mean, they'll be bringing
a couple of bottles with them, and...

1295
01:34:45,066 --> 01:34:48,569
You're getting closer, brother.
You're getting closer, but...

1296
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:53,074
...they're going to be sharing
more than just bottles, ain't they?

1297
01:34:53,574 --> 01:34:55,534
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, sure.

1298
01:34:55,618 --> 01:34:57,662
- I know what you mean.
- Understand what I mean?

1299
01:34:57,745 --> 01:34:59,914
Yeah, I understand what you mean.

1300
01:35:00,623 --> 01:35:03,084
- Anything you say.
- I'm on my knees, brother.

1301
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:05,878
- I'm on my knees.
- Yeah, all right, all right.

1302
01:35:06,253 --> 01:35:07,964
I'll let them in.

1303
01:35:10,424 --> 01:35:13,261
- Let me just give them a hand here.
- I appreciate that.

1304
01:35:13,344 --> 01:35:14,845
- Hi.
- Ladies!

1305
01:35:14,971 --> 01:35:18,266
Oh, thank you. I believe
this is your department, Mr. Turkle.

1306
01:35:18,349 --> 01:35:20,685
- Hi, there! Give me a hand.
- How're you doing?

1307
01:35:20,768 --> 01:35:22,478
Love to give you a hand.

1308
01:35:24,188 --> 01:35:25,481
Keep it down. Keep it down.

1309
01:35:25,564 --> 01:35:27,608
- I split my pants.
- Keep it down!

1310
01:35:28,317 --> 01:35:31,821
- Give it to me. Give it all to me.
- You got to keep it down!

1311
01:35:34,323 --> 01:35:36,409
This looks like my high school.

1312
01:35:38,452 --> 01:35:40,496
Oh, hey, I take that.

1313
01:35:40,621 --> 01:35:42,373
- The barber chair.
- You may have it.

1314
01:35:42,456 --> 01:35:43,958
It is mine, mine.

1315
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:46,585
You can have it. You can have it, honey.

1316
01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:49,922
Get a load of these tubs.

1317
01:35:50,006 --> 01:35:52,008
It's a real nice place you got here.

1318
01:35:53,134 --> 01:35:55,011
Hey, can I take a bath?

1319
01:35:55,177 --> 01:35:57,805
Sure, you can take a bath. Sure.

1320
01:35:58,097 --> 01:36:00,391
Just don't drown your pretty little self.

1321
01:36:00,474 --> 01:36:01,892
You know...

1322
01:36:02,143 --> 01:36:06,105
...Rose was married to a maniac once,
up in Beaverton.

1323
01:36:07,315 --> 01:36:08,524
Oh, really, miss?

1324
01:36:08,608 --> 01:36:10,234
What seemed to be the problem?

1325
01:36:10,318 --> 01:36:14,572
Oh, nothing, he used to put frogs
in my bra all the time.

1326
01:36:17,283 --> 01:36:18,784
Very interesting.

1327
01:36:18,993 --> 01:36:20,536
Very interesting.

1328
01:36:23,331 --> 01:36:27,168
Rose is very interested in hospitals,
and hospital facilities.

1329
01:36:27,251 --> 01:36:29,420
- I am?
- Yes. Oh, yes, you are.

1330
01:36:29,712 --> 01:36:32,298
- I'm going to take Miss Candy...
- Where you going?

1331
01:36:32,381 --> 01:36:34,592
I'm going to take Candy for a stroll.

1332
01:36:34,717 --> 01:36:36,344
I got you, I got you.

1333
01:36:36,427 --> 01:36:40,431
- But just don't make too much noise.
- Oh, no, not a peep, not a peep.

1334
01:36:43,142 --> 01:36:46,062
Now, you come over here, baby,
right over here.

1335
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,485
Don't worry about Candy, honey.
Sit down and relax.

1336
01:37:04,872 --> 01:37:06,499
<i>Wake up</i>, <i>boys.</i>

1337
01:37:07,166 --> 01:37:08,542
<i>Wake up.</i>

1338
01:37:08,793 --> 01:37:11,045
<i>It's medication time.</i>

1339
01:37:11,879 --> 01:37:13,881
<i>Medication time.</i>

1340
01:37:14,423 --> 01:37:16,425
<i>The nighttime spirits are here.</i>

1341
01:37:16,509 --> 01:37:18,803
<i>It's Randall to say goodbye...</i>

1342
01:37:19,095 --> 01:37:22,598
<i>... and get you high</i>,
<i>and nighttime angel</i>, <i>Candy.</i>

1343
01:37:24,475 --> 01:37:27,895
<i>That's right</i>, <i>Mr. Martini</i>,
<i>there is an Easter bunny.</i>

1344
01:37:37,655 --> 01:37:39,740
<i>Around the side</i>, <i>join Mr. McMurphy...</i>

1345
01:37:39,824 --> 01:37:42,076
<i>... in the executive lounge</i>, <i>please.</i>

1346
01:37:42,368 --> 01:37:43,786
<i>Around the side.</i>

1347
01:37:47,581 --> 01:37:49,709
It's going to be so great.

1348
01:37:50,376 --> 01:37:51,544
You'd like a nip, Charles?

1349
01:37:51,627 --> 01:37:53,921
No trouble at all!

1350
01:37:54,005 --> 01:37:57,883
It's Billy the Club of the fabulous
and fantastic...

1351
01:37:57,967 --> 01:38:00,678
- What the hell's going on?
- Mr. Turkle.

1352
01:38:03,931 --> 01:38:05,516
Ain't this a bitch!

1353
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,978
McMurphy, what're you trying to do?
Get my ass really fired?

1354
01:38:09,061 --> 01:38:11,856
Come on, get your ass out of here.
Come on.

1355
01:38:11,939 --> 01:38:13,316
We're just having a party.

1356
01:38:13,399 --> 01:38:16,861
Party, my ass! This ain't no nightclub,
this is a hospital!

1357
01:38:16,944 --> 01:38:20,990
Man, this is my fucking job!
I don't give a damn, this is my fucking job!

1358
01:38:22,783 --> 01:38:24,869
Oh, shit! The supervisor!

1359
01:38:25,244 --> 01:38:26,704
Get your asses back in there.

1360
01:38:26,787 --> 01:38:28,706
Come on. Come on there!

1361
01:38:28,998 --> 01:38:31,626
Where's that no-talking son of a bitch?
Is he in there?

1362
01:38:31,709 --> 01:38:33,127
Good. Come on.

1363
01:38:58,527 --> 01:38:59,904
Mr. Turkle?

1364
01:39:04,408 --> 01:39:05,660
Mr. Turkle?

1365
01:39:07,411 --> 01:39:10,039
Where the hell is he?
Why doesn't he answer?

1366
01:39:11,457 --> 01:39:13,292
He's jerking off somewhere.

1367
01:39:13,501 --> 01:39:15,920
Ain't nobody jerking off nowhere,
motherfucker!

1368
01:39:16,003 --> 01:39:19,298
Turkle, what the fuck are you doing here?
Go out and talk to her!

1369
01:39:19,382 --> 01:39:22,677
Doing the same fucking thing
you're doing in here, hiding!

1370
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:27,556
Yes, ma'am?

1371
01:39:28,849 --> 01:39:30,559
Is everything all right, Mr. Turkle?

1372
01:39:30,643 --> 01:39:32,770
Oh, everything is just fine, ma'am.

1373
01:39:32,853 --> 01:39:35,022
Just fine. Just fine.

1374
01:39:44,156 --> 01:39:45,366
Who's there?

1375
01:39:46,367 --> 01:39:47,994
Ain't nobody in there.

1376
01:39:48,077 --> 01:39:49,829
Please open that door.

1377
01:39:56,961 --> 01:39:58,296
I'm sorry.

1378
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:04,218
I'm sorry, ma'am, but...

1379
01:40:04,552 --> 01:40:07,888
...you know, a man gets
awfully lonesome at night.

1380
01:40:08,306 --> 01:40:10,683
You understand what I mean, don't you?

1381
01:40:10,891 --> 01:40:13,185
You understand? I'm sure you understand.

1382
01:40:13,269 --> 01:40:16,564
I want that woman off this ward
immediately.

1383
01:40:18,316 --> 01:40:19,567
Yes, ma'am.

1384
01:40:20,109 --> 01:40:21,360
Yes, ma'am.

1385
01:40:41,797 --> 01:40:43,799
- Jesus!
- Mr. Turkle, is she gone?

1386
01:40:43,883 --> 01:40:45,593
Shit! Yes, and so am I...

1387
01:40:45,676 --> 01:40:48,262
...so get your behinds out of here
and go to bed.

1388
01:40:48,346 --> 01:40:50,222
Go ahead, move it! Move it!

1389
01:40:50,306 --> 01:40:52,350
- I knew we were in trouble!
- Let's go!

1390
01:40:52,433 --> 01:40:55,102
You and your teddy bear ass!
Move them on out of here!

1391
01:40:55,186 --> 01:40:56,604
Come on, come on!

1392
01:40:56,979 --> 01:40:58,689
- Candy?
- Come on, Candy!

1393
01:40:58,814 --> 01:41:00,274
Jesus Christ!

1394
01:41:00,983 --> 01:41:02,693
Mr. Turkle, I'm really sorry.

1395
01:41:02,777 --> 01:41:05,363
Tell those fucking friends of mine
to stay out!

1396
01:41:05,446 --> 01:41:07,448
- Get out!
- I'm really sorry.

1397
01:41:07,615 --> 01:41:08,783
What are you...

1398
01:41:08,866 --> 01:41:10,701
What the fuck? Get out of here!

1399
01:41:10,785 --> 01:41:14,372
Please get out, this is my job!
You're fucking it up! You understand?

1400
01:41:14,455 --> 01:41:15,623
Get out!

1401
01:41:16,290 --> 01:41:18,793
Get out of here, you slim motherfucker!

1402
01:41:20,336 --> 01:41:21,629
Fuck it!

1403
01:41:22,964 --> 01:41:23,798
Fuck it!

1404
01:41:35,393 --> 01:41:39,105
Good night, good night,
don't let the cooties bite.

1405
01:42:06,632 --> 01:42:09,260
Right out of the shock department.
I got it from...

1406
01:42:09,343 --> 01:42:10,970
I got it from Ratched's charts.

1407
01:42:11,053 --> 01:42:13,222
Right. There you go. Easy now.

1408
01:42:13,306 --> 01:42:15,099
Don't take it all at once!

1409
01:42:15,433 --> 01:42:18,102
Let's try a little over here. There you go.

1410
01:44:03,624 --> 01:44:04,917
Let's go.

1411
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:12,925
I'll have to be the one, Chief.

1412
01:44:29,775 --> 01:44:31,694
Hey, Mac, what's going on?

1413
01:44:32,278 --> 01:44:33,446
Well, Dale...

1414
01:44:33,529 --> 01:44:35,990
...Lord Randall is stepping down one.

1415
01:44:37,074 --> 01:44:38,284
Fredrickson.

1416
01:44:40,411 --> 01:44:41,495
Jimmy.

1417
01:44:42,204 --> 01:44:44,332
Aren't you going to say goodbye to me?

1418
01:44:44,415 --> 01:44:47,043
Sure, I'm going to say
goodbye to you, Charles.

1419
01:44:50,212 --> 01:44:51,589
Thank you, Mac.

1420
01:44:52,006 --> 01:44:53,174
Thank you.

1421
01:44:53,674 --> 01:44:55,301
I'll never forget you.

1422
01:44:55,384 --> 01:44:57,470
Settle down, Charles, all right.

1423
01:45:00,389 --> 01:45:02,183
Hey, Billy, what's wrong?

1424
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,853
Billy, for Christ's sake?

1425
01:45:09,607 --> 01:45:11,150
What's the matter?

1426
01:45:15,321 --> 01:45:17,740
I'm going to miss you very...

1427
01:45:18,616 --> 01:45:20,368
...very much, Mac.

1428
01:45:23,663 --> 01:45:25,831
Why don't you come with us, then?

1429
01:45:28,209 --> 01:45:29,961
Think I don't want to?

1430
01:45:30,544 --> 01:45:32,630
Well, come on then, let's go.

1431
01:45:32,713 --> 01:45:35,258
Well, it's not that easy.

1432
01:45:39,053 --> 01:45:41,639
I'm not ready yet.

1433
01:45:44,809 --> 01:45:46,394
Tell you what we'll do...

1434
01:45:46,477 --> 01:45:49,021
When I get to Canada,
I'll write you a postcard...

1435
01:45:49,105 --> 01:45:51,065
...and I'll put my address on it.

1436
01:45:51,691 --> 01:45:53,734
That way when you're ready, you'll...

1437
01:45:53,818 --> 01:45:55,361
...you'll know where to go.

1438
01:45:55,444 --> 01:45:56,779
What do you say?

1439
01:46:04,954 --> 01:46:07,623
Is she going with you?

1440
01:46:12,712 --> 01:46:13,879
Candy?

1441
01:46:16,424 --> 01:46:19,969
Yeah, she'll be there when you get there.
She's going with us.

1442
01:46:21,512 --> 01:46:24,223
Are you going to marry her?

1443
01:46:26,225 --> 01:46:28,477
No, we're just good friends.

1444
01:46:29,395 --> 01:46:30,605
Why?

1445
01:46:37,945 --> 01:46:39,113
Nothing.

1446
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:43,159
Don't "nothing" me, all right? What is it?

1447
01:46:54,003 --> 01:46:55,296
It's too late.

1448
01:46:59,008 --> 01:47:00,927
Do you want a date with her?

1449
01:47:02,803 --> 01:47:06,474
Jesus, I must be crazy
to be in a looney bin like this!

1450
01:47:08,392 --> 01:47:09,769
Date, huh?

1451
01:47:10,311 --> 01:47:13,439
Well, it'll have to be a fast date,
I'll tell you that.

1452
01:47:16,692 --> 01:47:18,194
Not now!

1453
01:47:18,569 --> 01:47:19,862
Not now?

1454
01:47:20,404 --> 01:47:21,739
When, then?

1455
01:47:29,622 --> 01:47:31,540
When I have a free weekend.

1456
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:34,168
You're busy right now, are you?

1457
01:47:34,251 --> 01:47:36,212
You have something to do right now?

1458
01:47:36,295 --> 01:47:38,089
- You have something to do?
- No.

1459
01:47:38,172 --> 01:47:41,217
Good, then don't talk to me about
when you're ready. Yeah.

1460
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:43,302
- Ready and everything like that.
- No.

1461
01:47:43,386 --> 01:47:45,429
Candy, come here a minute.

1462
01:47:46,305 --> 01:47:48,849
I want you to meet the famous Billy.

1463
01:47:49,183 --> 01:47:50,768
Go get him, will you?

1464
01:47:51,143 --> 01:47:53,604
Go get him. Get him out of there.

1465
01:47:53,854 --> 01:47:56,857
I want you to get a hold of Billy...

1466
01:47:58,484 --> 01:48:00,653
All you have to do is one little thing.

1467
01:48:00,736 --> 01:48:02,947
- The kid is cute, isn't he?
- Yeah.

1468
01:48:08,661 --> 01:48:10,538
Think of me the whole time.

1469
01:48:11,872 --> 01:48:13,124
There he is.

1470
01:48:13,624 --> 01:48:15,042
Billy the Club!

1471
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:23,634
I got $25...

1472
01:48:24,385 --> 01:48:27,388
...that says you are going to burn
this woman down!

1473
01:48:34,270 --> 01:48:35,771
Candy, baby...

1474
01:48:40,109 --> 01:48:41,485
...I love you.

1475
01:48:42,236 --> 01:48:43,738
Hurl the ringer.

1476
01:48:48,409 --> 01:48:51,078
Take it easy! Back!

1477
01:48:53,706 --> 01:48:55,750
No, I'll show you some card tricks.

1478
01:48:55,833 --> 01:48:57,752
You ain't seen the Spanish deck yet.

1479
01:48:57,835 --> 01:48:59,879
That's 40 percent more torture.

1480
01:49:03,549 --> 01:49:08,012
I'm going to present you
with this fine deck of cards for playing.

1481
01:49:11,432 --> 01:49:14,602
This ain't going to take long, Rose,
you know what I mean?

1482
01:49:24,946 --> 01:49:26,697
When we get to Canada...

1483
01:51:14,013 --> 01:51:15,556
Out of sight, man!

1484
01:51:16,057 --> 01:51:17,266
Out of sight!

1485
01:51:33,491 --> 01:51:36,202
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.

1486
01:51:40,957 --> 01:51:42,249
Mr. Warren...

1487
01:51:42,792 --> 01:51:44,669
...close the window, and lock the screen.

1488
01:51:44,752 --> 01:51:46,003
Right.

1489
01:52:11,404 --> 01:52:14,407
Mr. Miller, show this woman
the way out of the hospital.

1490
01:52:14,490 --> 01:52:15,700
Gladly.

1491
01:52:17,618 --> 01:52:19,036
Come on, lady, let's go.

1492
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:20,705
- You're going home.
- Where?

1493
01:52:20,788 --> 01:52:22,206
Let her go, Scanlon.

1494
01:52:22,290 --> 01:52:23,374
You're going home.

1495
01:52:23,457 --> 01:52:24,917
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes.

1496
01:52:25,126 --> 01:52:26,752
Make sure no one is missing.

1497
01:52:26,836 --> 01:52:27,962
Will do.

1498
01:52:29,547 --> 01:52:31,340
- Mac?
- Come on, Scanlon, let's move.

1499
01:52:31,424 --> 01:52:33,384
Everybody, out of here! Move it out!

1500
01:52:33,467 --> 01:52:34,552
Come on, move it!

1501
01:52:34,635 --> 01:52:36,721
Martini, get your butt up! Come on, up!

1502
01:52:36,804 --> 01:52:38,889
All right, get your dead ass up there!

1503
01:52:38,973 --> 01:52:41,851
What the hell's going on here?
Come on, move out!

1504
01:52:49,859 --> 01:52:51,485
Miss Ratched?

1505
01:52:55,156 --> 01:52:56,365
What are you doing?

1506
01:52:56,449 --> 01:52:58,284
Where you going? Back out here!

1507
01:52:58,367 --> 01:53:00,286
Let's go! Come on, move it!

1508
01:53:02,371 --> 01:53:03,956
Taber, get up. Come on.

1509
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,499
I said, get up!

1510
01:53:09,128 --> 01:53:10,588
All right, move it back there!

1511
01:53:10,671 --> 01:53:13,799
Get your ass over here,
and bring Dracula with you.

1512
01:53:13,925 --> 01:53:14,634
Move it.

1513
01:53:17,887 --> 01:53:19,680
Stay right there, Bancini!

1514
01:53:20,932 --> 01:53:22,558
- Miss Ratched?
- Yes.

1515
01:53:22,683 --> 01:53:24,852
It looks like Billy is the only one missing.

1516
01:53:24,936 --> 01:53:26,103
Billy?

1517
01:53:26,979 --> 01:53:29,106
- Thank you, Mr. Washington.
- Okay.

1518
01:53:30,816 --> 01:53:34,362
Did Billy Bibbit leave the grounds
of the hospital, gentlemen?

1519
01:53:39,116 --> 01:53:41,160
I want an answer to my question!

1520
01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:44,872
Did he leave the grounds of the hospital?

1521
01:53:57,927 --> 01:53:59,470
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes.

1522
01:53:59,553 --> 01:54:01,681
Miss Pilbow, check all the rooms.

1523
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:04,058
- Mr. Warren?
- Yes.

1524
01:54:04,141 --> 01:54:06,102
You start with the tub room.

1525
01:54:13,234 --> 01:54:14,527
Mr. Martini?

1526
01:54:15,778 --> 01:54:17,530
May I have my cap, please?

1527
01:54:18,614 --> 01:54:19,907
My cap!

1528
01:54:20,074 --> 01:54:21,492
My cap!

1529
01:54:21,575 --> 01:54:22,702
There.

1530
01:54:27,248 --> 01:54:28,499
Thank you.

1531
01:54:53,941 --> 01:54:55,276
Miss Ratched.

1532
01:55:46,077 --> 01:55:47,912
I can explain everything.

1533
01:55:48,913 --> 01:55:50,331
Please do, Billy.

1534
01:55:50,998 --> 01:55:52,500
Explain everything.

1535
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:57,672
Everything?

1536
01:56:00,216 --> 01:56:01,801
Aren't you ashamed?

1537
01:56:04,804 --> 01:56:06,138
No, I'm not.

1538
01:56:16,857 --> 01:56:19,026
You know, Billy, what worries me is...

1539
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:21,612
...how your mother's going to take this.

1540
01:56:31,747 --> 01:56:33,249
Well, you...

1541
01:56:33,666 --> 01:56:37,587
...don't have to tell her, Miss Ratched.

1542
01:56:40,006 --> 01:56:41,716
I don't have to tell her?

1543
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:45,928
Your mother and I are old friends,
you know that.

1544
01:56:55,271 --> 01:56:58,149
Please don't...

1545
01:56:59,859 --> 01:57:00,985
...tell my mother.

1546
01:57:01,068 --> 01:57:04,822
Don't you think you should've thought
of that before you took that woman...

1547
01:57:04,905 --> 01:57:06,282
...in that room?

1548
01:57:15,082 --> 01:57:16,375
No, no.

1549
01:57:22,423 --> 01:57:23,591
I didn't.

1550
01:57:23,758 --> 01:57:26,594
You mean, she dragged you
in there by force?

1551
01:57:40,775 --> 01:57:42,109
She did.

1552
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:47,949
Everybody did.

1553
01:57:48,324 --> 01:57:50,242
Everybody? Who did?

1554
01:57:51,619 --> 01:57:53,162
You tell me who did!

1555
01:58:13,808 --> 01:58:15,184
McMurphy.

1556
01:58:19,563 --> 01:58:20,940
Miss Ratched...

1557
01:58:22,566 --> 01:58:23,818
...please don't...

1558
01:58:23,901 --> 01:58:26,112
...tell my mother, please.

1559
01:58:26,404 --> 01:58:29,407
Would you see that the men
are washed and ready for the day?

1560
01:58:29,490 --> 01:58:32,118
Miss Ratched, please, please...

1561
01:58:34,203 --> 01:58:35,621
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes?

1562
01:58:35,705 --> 01:58:38,082
- Put Billy in Dr. Spivey's office.
- No.

1563
01:58:38,791 --> 01:58:41,168
Stay with him till the doctor arrives.

1564
01:58:46,299 --> 01:58:48,509
Move it! Come on, Martini, get on!

1565
01:59:11,907 --> 01:59:15,369
Hey, that way, please. Please, gentlemen.

1566
01:59:15,578 --> 01:59:18,289
Let's go, come on.
Come on, you guys. What is this?

1567
01:59:18,372 --> 01:59:19,540
Let's go.

1568
01:59:43,648 --> 01:59:45,524
Hey, what the hell is that?

1569
01:59:45,858 --> 01:59:48,235
McMurphy, what the hell are you doing?

1570
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:56,327
<i>Washington</i>, <i>to the day room!</i>
<i>Immediately!</i>

1571
02:00:07,296 --> 02:00:09,840
Put down those keys and nobody gets hurt.

1572
02:00:19,558 --> 02:00:23,020
Move away from the window
and take that damn Chief with you.

1573
02:00:34,615 --> 02:00:36,242
Come on, let's go!

1574
02:00:45,459 --> 02:00:46,794
Let me through!

1575
02:00:47,420 --> 02:00:48,921
Let me through!

1576
02:00:59,432 --> 02:01:01,267
Out of the way, McMurphy!

1577
02:01:04,770 --> 02:01:05,896
Come on, clear it!

1578
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:07,982
Get these people out of here!

1579
02:01:08,274 --> 02:01:09,358
Oh, Billy!

1580
02:01:09,442 --> 02:01:10,943
Will you guys clear the door?

1581
02:01:11,027 --> 02:01:13,654
Everybody out! Out! Everybody out!

1582
02:01:13,738 --> 02:01:15,281
Come on, goddamn it!

1583
02:01:18,743 --> 02:01:20,244
Now calm down!

1584
02:01:20,828 --> 02:01:24,081
The best thing we can do
is go on with our daily routine.

1585
02:01:24,165 --> 02:01:25,416
All right?

1586
02:01:33,007 --> 02:01:34,508
Don't! Mac!

1587
02:01:40,222 --> 02:01:41,724
Mac! No!

1588
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:21,555
And the bets are placed.

1589
02:02:21,722 --> 02:02:24,850
There's one for Tabes, and Chessy,
and Martini, and the dealer.

1590
02:02:24,934 --> 02:02:27,311
And a four to Tabes, and a six, and a nine...

1591
02:02:27,395 --> 02:02:29,480
...and a ten to the dealer.

1592
02:02:29,563 --> 02:02:30,690
A nine?

1593
02:02:31,107 --> 02:02:32,775
What do you say, Tabes?

1594
02:02:33,192 --> 02:02:34,527
A dime apiece.

1595
02:02:35,069 --> 02:02:36,654
No? You stick.

1596
02:02:36,946 --> 02:02:39,073
- He sticks.
- He sticks with a four.

1597
02:02:41,409 --> 02:02:43,327
Chessy's going for the ride.

1598
02:02:43,536 --> 02:02:45,162
What does that mean?

1599
02:02:45,246 --> 02:02:47,206
He wants a hit. Yeah, and a big queen.

1600
02:02:47,290 --> 02:02:48,583
I think you're busted.

1601
02:02:48,666 --> 02:02:50,167
Buggered, not busted.

1602
02:02:50,251 --> 02:02:51,836
- Turn them over.
- Buggered.

1603
02:02:51,919 --> 02:02:53,004
And weep.

1604
02:02:53,212 --> 02:02:54,589
Hit me.

1605
02:02:55,590 --> 02:02:57,174
I think you're over.

1606
02:02:57,258 --> 02:02:58,801
- I know you're over.
- Hovno.

1607
02:02:58,884 --> 02:03:00,553
That's a three. Hovno.

1608
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:14,275
<i>Mr. Sefelt?</i>

1609
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:17,612
<i>Did everything go well?</i>

1610
02:03:20,281 --> 02:03:21,741
<i>That's very nice.</i>

1611
02:03:22,074 --> 02:03:24,160
<i>Now you feel better</i>, <i>don't you?</i>

1612
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:25,953
Yes, ma'am.

1613
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:29,540
Deuce to the dealer.

1614
02:03:29,916 --> 02:03:31,459
Split them. Higher.

1615
02:03:32,877 --> 02:03:34,253
McMurphy is out.

1616
02:03:38,966 --> 02:03:40,801
McMurphy has escaped.

1617
02:03:42,053 --> 02:03:44,347
They were taking him through the tunnel.

1618
02:03:44,430 --> 02:03:47,058
He beat up two of the attendants
and escaped.

1619
02:03:47,391 --> 02:03:48,976
McMurphy is upstairs.

1620
02:03:49,435 --> 02:03:50,978
Oh, no, no!

1621
02:03:51,145 --> 02:03:53,564
Jim, I'm telling you,
McMurphy is upstairs...

1622
02:03:53,648 --> 02:03:55,399
...and he's as meek as a lamb.

1623
02:03:55,483 --> 02:03:56,484
Really?

1624
02:03:56,651 --> 02:03:58,444
I mean, how do you know?

1625
02:03:59,487 --> 02:04:01,113
Jack Dunphy told me.

1626
02:04:01,530 --> 02:04:03,407
Jack Dunphy is full of shit!

1627
02:04:03,699 --> 02:04:05,326
Right! Right!

1628
02:05:58,147 --> 02:05:59,941
They said you escaped.

1629
02:06:01,943 --> 02:06:04,028
I knew you wouldn't leave without me.

1630
02:06:04,111 --> 02:06:05,696
I was waiting for you.

1631
02:06:06,906 --> 02:06:08,658
Now we can make it, Mac.

1632
02:06:09,241 --> 02:06:11,243
I feel big as a damn mountain.

1633
02:06:30,096 --> 02:06:31,347
Oh, no!

1634
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:05,006
I'm not going without you, Mac.

1635
02:07:08,050 --> 02:07:10,303
I wouldn't leave you here this way.

1636
02:07:20,521 --> 02:07:22,148
You're coming with me.

1637
02:07:44,003 --> 02:07:45,379
Let's go!

1638
