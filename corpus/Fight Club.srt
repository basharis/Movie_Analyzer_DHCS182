1
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,759
People are always asking me

2
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,419
if I know Tyler Durden.

3
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,196
3 minutes.

4
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,892
Ground zero.

5
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,060
Would you like to say a few
words to mark the occasion?

6
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,101
With a gun barrel between your teeth,

7
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:20,231
you speak only in vowels.

8
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,569
I can't think of anything.

9
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,235
For a second I totally forget

10
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,836
about Tyler's whole
controlled demolition thing,

11
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:28,075
and I wonder how clean that gun is.

12
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,913
Getting exciting now.

13
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:31,009
That old saying,

14
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:33,247
how you always hurt the one you love?

15
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:35,510
Well, it works both ways.

16
00:02:36,277 --> 00:02:37,710
We have front row seats

17
00:02:37,778 --> 00:02:39,804
for this theater of mass destruction.

18
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:42,212
The demolitions committee
of Project Mayhem

19
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:44,720
wrapped the foundation
columns of a dozen buildings

20
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:47,722
with blasting gelatin. In 2 minutes,

21
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,725
primary charges will blow base charges

22
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:51,055
and a few square blocks

23
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:53,823
will be reduced to smoldering rubble.

24
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:54,955
I know this...

25
00:02:55,032 --> 00:02:56,727
because Tyler knows this.

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,392
21/2.

27
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:00,368
Think of everything we've accomplished.

28
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:03,429
And suddenly, I realize
that all of this:

29
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,999
The gun, the bombs, the revolution...

30
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:09,535
has got something to do with
a girl named Marla Singer.

31
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:14,108
Bob. Bob had bitch-tits.

32
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:18,178
This was a support group for
men with testicular cancer.

33
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:20,690
The big moosey slobbering all over me,

34
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:21,748
that was Bob.

35
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,987
We're still men.

36
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:26,053
Yes, we're men.

37
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,564
Men is what we are.

38
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,692
8 months ago, Bob's
testicles were removed.

39
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:34,260
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch-tits

40
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,330
because his testosterone was too high,

41
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:38,205
and his body upped the estrogen.

42
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:39,538
And that was where I fit...

43
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:41,545
They're gonna have to
open up my pecks again

44
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:42,638
and drain the fluid.

45
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:44,546
Between those huge, sweating tits

46
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:47,985
that hung enormous the way
you'd think of God’s as big.

47
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,147
OK. You cry now.

48
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:54,716
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.

49
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:57,793
For 6 months, I couldn't sleep.

50
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,424
I couldn't sleep. I couldn't sleep.

51
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,660
With insomnia, nothing's real.

52
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:05,332
Everything's far away.

53
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:10,208
Everything's a copy of a copy of a copy.

54
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:15,345
When deep space exploration ramps up,

55
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,113
it'll be the corporations
that names everything:

56
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:20,677
The I.B.M. Stellar sphere,

57
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:22,690
the Microsoft Galaxy,

58
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:25,319
Planet Starbucks.

59
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,022
Gonna need you out of town
a little more this week.

60
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:28,529
We got some red flags to cover.

61
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:29,998
It must've been Tuesday.

62
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,193
He was wearing his cornflower-blue tie.

63
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:34,361
You want me to deprioritize
my current reports

64
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:36,837
until you advise of a status upgrade?

65
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,703
Make these your primary action items.

66
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:39,867
Here's your flight coupons.

67
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:41,501
Call me from the road
if there's any snags.

68
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,044
He was full of pep.

69
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:46,310
Must have had his grandee latte enema.

70
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:50,211
Like so many others,
I had become a slave

71
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:52,551
to the IKEA nesting instinct.

72
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:56,525
Uh, yes. I'd like to order
the Erica Pekkary dust ruffles.

73
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:57,560
Please hold.

74
00:04:57,628 --> 00:04:58,890
If I saw something clever

75
00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:01,954
Like a little coffee table
in the shape of a yin-yang,

76
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:03,829
I had to have it.

77
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:06,734
The Klipske personal office unit,

78
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:09,273
the Hovetrekke home exert-bike,

79
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,000
or the Johannshamn sofa

80
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:13,340
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.

81
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:15,345
Even the Rizlampa wire lamps

82
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:18,507
of environmentally
friendly unbleached paper.

83
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,414
I'd flip through catalogs and wonder:

84
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:24,512
What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?

85
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:25,956
I had it all.

86
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,220
Even the glass dishes

87
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,194
with tiny bubbles and imperfections.

88
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,356
Proof that they were crafted
by the honest, simple,

89
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,195
hard-working
indigenous peoples of -

90
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,199
Please hold.

91
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,200
Wherever.

92
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,566
I was holding.

93
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,231
We used to read pornography.

94
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,366
Now it was the Horchow collection.

95
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,435
No, you can't die from insomnia.

96
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,605
What about narcolepsy?

97
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,617
I nod off. I wake up in strange places.

98
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,242
I have no idea how I got there.

99
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,048
You need to lighten up.

100
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:55,386
Can you please just get me something?

101
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:58,653
Red and blue Tuenois,
lipstick-red Seconais.

102
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:03,356
No. You need healthy natural sleep.

103
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:06,993
Chew some Valerian root
and get more exercise.

104
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:12,169
Hey, come on. I'm in pain.

105
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:14,003
You wanna see pain?

106
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:15,805
Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.

107
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:18,972
See the guys with testicular cancer.

108
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,673
That's pain.

109
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,464
I always wanted 3 kids,

110
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:40,469
2 boys and a girl.

111
00:06:40,537 --> 00:06:44,439
Mindy wanted 2 girls and a boy.

112
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:47,444
We never could agree on anything.

113
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,480
Well, uh, you know, she-

114
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:52,108
She had her first child last week, a...

115
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:53,914
a girl.

116
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:57,546
With-With her, uh,
with her new husband.

117
00:06:57,622 --> 00:06:59,988
Fuck.

118
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:04,155
Hey-Hey, thank God, you know.

119
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,596
I'm-I'm glad for her.

120
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:11,036
Because she deserves it.

121
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:17,300
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

122
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,675
Thank you, Thomas.

123
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:23,010
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage,

124
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:25,176
and that gives me strength.

125
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:27,618
We give each other strength.

126
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,621
It's time for
the one-on-ones.

127
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:32,488
So let's all of us here
follow Thomas' good example

128
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,992
and really open ourselves up.

129
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:37,360
Would you find a partner?

130
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,864
And this is how I met the big moosey...

131
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,062
Come on. Let's go over here.

132
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:47,369
His eyes already
shrink-wrapped in tears...

133
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,046
knees together, those
awkward little steps.

134
00:07:57,952 --> 00:07:59,044
My name is Bob.

135
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,553
Bob.

136
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:03,147
Bob had been a champion body-builder.

137
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:05,158
You know that chest-expansion program

138
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:08,323
you see on late-night
TV? That was his idea.

139
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,161
I was a juicer.

140
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:13,829
You know, using steroids.

141
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:16,634
Diabonal and...

142
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:19,175
Wistrol. Oh, they use that

143
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:22,507
on racehorses, for Christ sakes.

144
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,344
And now I'm bankrupt.

145
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,509
I'm divorced.

146
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:31,022
My 2 grown kids...

147
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,889
won't even return my phone calls.

148
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,655
Strangers with this kind of honesty

149
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:39,253
make me go a big rubbery one.

150
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,034
Go ahead, Cornelius.

151
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:45,330
You can cry.

152
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:03,821
And then, something happened.

153
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:05,323
I let go.

154
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:06,858
That's really good.

155
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,917
Lost in oblivion...

156
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:12,158
dark and silent and complete.

157
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,663
I found freedom.

158
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:19,501
Losing all hope was freedom.

159
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:21,507
It's OK.

160
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:27,009
Babies don't sleep this well.

161
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:33,183
I became addicted.

162
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:46,698
Come on.

163
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:49,136
If I didn't say anything...

164
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:51,037
people always assumed the worst.

165
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:53,974
Welcome, Travis.

166
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:57,875
They cried harder...

167
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:00,178
then I cried harder.

168
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:10,498
Now we're going to open the green door,

169
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,162
the heart chakra.

170
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,503
I wasn't really dying.

171
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:17,509
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.

172
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:19,671
I was the warm little center

173
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:21,359
that the life of this
world crowded around.

174
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,346
Imagine your pain

175
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,818
as a white ball of healing light.

176
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:30,255
It moves over your body, healing you.

177
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:34,021
Now, keep this going.
Remember to breathe,

178
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,688
and step forward

179
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:38,357
through the back door of the room.

180
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:40,867
Where does it lead?

181
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:43,530
To your cave.

182
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:46,872
Step forward into your cave.

183
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:48,138
That's right.

184
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:52,740
You're going deeper into your cave,

185
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:57,583
and you're going to
find your power animal.

186
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:01,121
Slide.

187
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:15,373
Every evening, I died...

188
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,466
and every evening, I was born again.

189
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:20,204
Resurrected.

190
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:24,306
Bob loved me because he thought

191
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:25,974
my testicles were removed, too.

192
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,612
Being there...

193
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,551
pressed against his tits,

194
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:32,249
ready to cry.

195
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:34,224
This was my vacation.

196
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:41,963
And she ruined everything.

197
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,466
This is cancer, right?

198
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,038
This chick Marla Singer

199
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,577
did not have testicular cancer.

200
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,339
She was a liar.

201
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,007
She had no diseases at all.

202
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,744
I had seen her at Free and Clear

203
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,082
my blood parasites group Thursdays.

204
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,850
Then at Hope, my bimonthly
sickle cell circle.

205
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,188
And again at Seize the Day,

206
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,819
my tuberculosis Friday night.

207
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,727
Marla, the big tourist.

208
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:17,033
Her lie reflected my lie,

209
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:19,802
and suddenly, I felt nothing.

210
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,502
I couldn't cry.

211
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:24,546
So once again, I couldn't sleep.

212
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:39,858
Next group, after guided meditation,

213
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:41,658
after we open our heart chakras,

214
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:42,994
when it's time to hug,

215
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,158
I'm gonna grab that little bitch

216
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:45,496
Marla Singer and scream...

217
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:48,265
Marla, you liar! You big tourist!

218
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:49,533
I need this! Now get out!

219
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:54,075
I hadn't slept in 4 days.

220
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:55,839
Absolutely. We'll just let that dry.

221
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:56,844
When you have insomnia,

222
00:12:56,913 --> 00:12:59,405
you're never really asleep...

223
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:01,473
and you're never really awake.

224
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:05,787
To begin tonight's communion,

225
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:09,657
Chloe would like to say a few words.

226
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:12,390
Oh, yeah... Chloe.

227
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:13,863
Chloe looked the way

228
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:15,456
Meryl Streep's skeleton would look

229
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:17,502
if you made it smile
and walk around the party

230
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:19,969
being extra nice to everybody.

231
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:22,165
Well, I'm still here,

232
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,141
but I don't know for how long.

233
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,873
That's as much certainty

234
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,676
as anyone can give me.

235
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:31,946
But I've got some good news.

236
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,008
I no longer have

237
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:35,112
any fear of death.

238
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,861
But I am in a pretty lonely place.

239
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,455
No one will have sex with me.

240
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,865
I'm so close to the end,

241
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:50,234
and all I want is to get
laid for the last time.

242
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:55,007
I have pornographic
movies in my apartment,

243
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:57,238
and lubricants and amyl nitrate.

244
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:58,904
Chloe...

245
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,848
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

246
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:08,850
Now, let's... ready ourselves

247
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:11,551
for guided meditation.

248
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:15,222
You're standing at the
entrance of your cave.

249
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:19,165
You step inside your cave, and you walk.

250
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:20,998
If I did have a tumor...

251
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,630
I'd name it Marla.

252
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:25,298
Marla...

253
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:27,206
the little scratch on
the roof of your mouth

254
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:29,905
that would heal if only
you could stop tonguing it,

255
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,174
but you can't.

256
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:32,772
...deeper into your cave

257
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:35,409
as you walk.

258
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:37,783
You feel the healing
energy of this place

259
00:14:37,854 --> 00:14:40,982
all around you.

260
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:43,048
Now find your power animal.

261
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:48,992
Slide.

262
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:55,931
OK. Now let's partner up.

263
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:58,272
Pick someone special to you tonight.

264
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:06,317
Hey.

265
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:08,319
We need to talk.

266
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:09,320
Sure.

267
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:15,194
I'm onto you.

268
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:16,194
What?

269
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:17,821
Yeah. You're a faker.

270
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:19,228
You're not dying.

271
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:20,596
Sorry?

272
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,933
In the Tibetan philosophy,
Sylvia Plath sense of the word,

273
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:25,664
I know we're all
- we're all dying, all right?

274
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:28,207
But you're not dying the way
Chloe back there is dying.

275
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,399
So?

276
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:33,275
So you're a tourist.

277
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:35,281
OK? I've seen you. I saw you-

278
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:36,645
saw you at melanoma,

279
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,014
saw you at tuberculosis,

280
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:40,019
I saw you at testicular cancer.

281
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:41,782
I saw you practicing this.

282
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,152
Practicing what?

283
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:44,281
Telling me off.

284
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:47,020
Is it going as well as you hoped...

285
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:48,187
"RUPERT"?

286
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:49,594
I'll expose you.

287
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:51,655
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

288
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:52,928
All right, come together.

289
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:55,231
Let yourselves cry.

290
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,541
Oh, God, why are you doing this?

291
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:07,137
It's cheaper than a movie,
and there's free coffee.

292
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:08,206
No, look...

293
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:10,186
this is important, OK?

294
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:11,220
These are my groups.

295
00:16:11,288 --> 00:16:12,880
I've been coming here for over a year.

296
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:15,050
Why do you do it?

297
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,184
I don't know.

298
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,692
When people think you're dying,

299
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:19,354
man, they really, really listen to you

300
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,556
instead of just...

301
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:24,157
Instead of just waiting
for their turn to speak.

302
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,830
Yeah.

303
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:30,374
Share yourself... completely.

304
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,975
OK, you don't want to get into this.

305
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:34,602
It becomes an addiction.

306
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,669
Really?

307
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:36,908
I'm not kidding.

308
00:16:36,982 --> 00:16:39,075
I can't cry if there's
another faker present,

309
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:40,242
and I need this.

310
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:42,184
So you got to find somewhere else to go.

311
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:44,586
Candy stripe a cancer ward.

312
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,521
It's not my problem.

313
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:50,451
Wait, wait, wait.

314
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:52,053
Whoa. Hold on. I'll tell you.

315
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:53,689
We're gonna split up the week, OK?

316
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:55,734
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis-

317
00:16:55,801 --> 00:16:56,927
You take tuberculosis.

318
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:58,560
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

319
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:00,070
OK. Good. Fine.

320
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,233
Testicular cancer should
be no contest, I think.

321
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:03,274
Well, technically,

322
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:05,071
I have more right to be there than you.

323
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:06,202
You still have your bails.

324
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:07,211
You're kidding.

325
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,077
I don't know. Am I?

326
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:10,707
No. No.

327
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:11,773
What do you want?

328
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:13,376
I'll take the parasites.

329
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:14,920
You can't have both the parasites,

330
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:16,319
but why don't you take
the blood parasites-

331
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:17,618
I want brain parasites.

332
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:19,318
I'll take the blood parasites,

333
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:21,121
but I'm gonna take the
organic brain dementia-

334
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:22,126
I want that.

335
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:23,493
You can't have the whole brain.

336
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:26,157
So far you have 4. I only have 2.

337
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:27,426
OK.

338
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,199
Take both the parasites. They're yours.

339
00:17:30,273 --> 00:17:32,069
Now we both have 3.

340
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:38,569
Hey, you left half your clothes!

341
00:17:54,765 --> 00:17:56,585
What, are you selling those?

342
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:58,448
Yes! I'm selling some clothes.

343
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,578
So,

344
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:00,986
we each have 3. That's 6.

345
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:03,286
What about the seventh day?
I want ascending bowel cancer.

346
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,792
The girl had done her homework.

347
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,792
Thank you.

348
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:06,793
No. No, I...

349
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:09,092
I want bowel cancer.

350
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:10,894
That's your favorite, too?

351
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:13,196
Try to slip it by me, eh?

352
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:14,735
Look, we're gonna split it, OK?

353
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,567
Take the first and third
Sunday of the month.

354
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:20,910
Deal.

355
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,413
Looks like this is good-bye.

356
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:27,609
Well, let's not make a
big thing out of it, OK?

357
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:29,549
How's this for not making a big thing?

358
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,421
Hey, Marla!

359
00:18:36,493 --> 00:18:37,426
Marla!

360
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,088
May-Maybe we should exchange numbers.

361
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:42,598
Should we?

362
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,635
W- We might want to switch nights.

363
00:18:46,202 --> 00:18:47,191
OK.

364
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:54,703
This is how I met Marla Singer.

365
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:58,080
Marla's philosophy of life

366
00:18:58,151 --> 00:19:00,210
was that she might die at any moment.

367
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:02,981
The tragedy, she said,
was that she didn't.

368
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:04,216
It doesn't have your name.

369
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,314
Who are you,

370
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,450
Cornelius, Rupert,

371
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:08,859
Travis,

372
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:10,123
any of the stupid names

373
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:11,357
you give each night?

374
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:17,435
You wake up at SeaTac.

375
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:18,698
S.F.O...

376
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:20,797
L.A.X...

377
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:22,705
You wake up at O'Hare...

378
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:24,266
Dallas-Fort Worth...

379
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:26,312
B.W.I...

380
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,610
Pacific, mountain, central...

381
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:30,241
Lose an hour, gain an hour...

382
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:31,841
Check-in for that flight doesn't begin

383
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,409
for another 2 hours, sir.

384
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:37,514
This is your life, and it's
ending one minute at a time.

385
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,991
You wake up at Air
Harbor international...

386
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,995
...the aircraft has
come to a complete stop.

387
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:43,723
If you wake up at a different time,

388
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:45,766
in a different place,

389
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,927
could you wake up as a different person?

390
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:51,138
Everywhere I travel,

391
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,640
tiny life...

392
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,538
single-serving sugar...

393
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:55,735
single-serving cream...

394
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,642
single pat of butter...

395
00:19:57,713 --> 00:20:00,545
a microwave cordon-bleu hobby kit.

396
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:02,584
Shampoo-conditioner combos.

397
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:05,882
Sample package mouthwash,
tiny bars of soap.

398
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,517
The people I meet on each flight,

399
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:13,655
they're single-serving friends.

400
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:16,529
Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together,

401
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:18,865
but that's all we get.

402
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:20,801
Welcome!

403
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,998
On a long enough timeline,

404
00:20:24,075 --> 00:20:26,600
the survival rate for
everyone drops to zero.

405
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:28,738
I was a recall coordinator.

406
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:30,873
My job was to apply the formula.

407
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:31,881
Here's where the infant

408
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,248
went through the windshield.

409
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,308
3 points.

410
00:20:34,387 --> 00:20:35,717
A new car built by my company

411
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:38,154
leaves somewhere traveling
at 60 miles per hour.

412
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:40,714
The rear differential locks up.

413
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:41,782
The teenager's braces

414
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,384
are wrapped around
the back seat ashtray.

415
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:45,727
Might make a good antismoking ad.

416
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,231
The car crashes and burns

417
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:48,891
with everyone trapped inside.

418
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:51,459
Now, should we initiate a recall?

419
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:52,731
The father must've been huge.

420
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:53,965
You see where the fat

421
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,200
has burned to the seat,

422
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:56,765
the polyester shirt?

423
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:58,901
- Very modern art.
- Ha ha ha!

424
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:01,947
Take the number of
vehicles in the field, "A,"

425
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:04,642
multiply it by the probable
rate of failure, "B,"

426
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:05,741
then multiply the result

427
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:08,117
by the average out-of
- court settlement, "C."

428
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:10,919
"A" times "B" times "C"

429
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:12,458
equals "X."

430
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:15,460
If "X" is less than
the cost of a recall,

431
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:17,724
we don't do one.

432
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:19,026
Are there a lot

433
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:20,999
of these kinds of accidents?

434
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:22,933
You wouldn't believe.

435
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:26,968
Which car company do you work for?

436
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:29,705
A major one.

437
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:33,672
Every time the plane banked too sharply

438
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:35,580
on takeoff or landing,

439
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:37,517
I prayed for a crash

440
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,077
or a midair collision.

441
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:41,123
Anything.

442
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:51,798
Life insurance pays off triple

443
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:53,360
if you die on a business trip.

444
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:59,241
"If you are seated in
an emergency exit row..."

445
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,504
Yeah...

446
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:02,169
"And you feel you would be unable

447
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:03,646
or unwilling to perform the duties

448
00:22:03,715 --> 00:22:05,444
Listed on the safety card,

449
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:07,107
please ask a flight attendant

450
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:08,116
to reseat you."

451
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:12,016
It's a lot of responsibility.

452
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,320
Wanna switch seats?

453
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:15,950
No. I'm not sure I'm the man

454
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:17,858
for that particular job.

455
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:20,830
An exit-door procedure at 30,000 feet.

456
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:22,457
Mm-hmm.

457
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,467
The illusion of safety.

458
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:27,265
Yeah. I guess so.

459
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:29,830
You know why they put
oxygen masks on planes?

460
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:31,638
So you can breathe.

461
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,577
Oxygen gets you high.

462
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:36,080
In a catastrophic emergency,

463
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,140
you're taking giant panicked breaths.

464
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:41,778
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

465
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:44,084
You accept your fate.

466
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,750
It's all right here.

467
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,554
Emergency water landing-

468
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:50,096
600 miles an hour.

469
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:51,189
Blank faces,

470
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:52,926
calm as Hindu cows.

471
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,025
That's, um...

472
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:58,128
That's an interesting theory.

473
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:02,073
What do you do?

474
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,577
What do you mean?

475
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:04,906
What do you do for a living?

476
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:08,108
Why? So you can pretend
like you're interested?

477
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:11,979
OK.

478
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:13,886
You have a kind of sick desperation

479
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:15,185
in your laugh.

480
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:20,521
We have the exact same briefcase.

481
00:23:21,797 --> 00:23:23,425
Soap.

482
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:24,431
Sorry?

483
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,229
I make and I sell soap-

484
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:30,136
the yard stick of civilization.

485
00:23:30,206 --> 00:23:31,935
And this is how I met...

486
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:33,703
"Tyler Durden."

487
00:23:33,776 --> 00:23:35,607
Did you know, if you mixed equal parts

488
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,578
of gasoline and frozen
or angejuice concentrate,

489
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:39,444
you can make napalm?

490
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:41,346
No, I did not know that. Is that true?

491
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,475
That's right.

492
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:44,144
One can make all kinds of explosives

493
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,017
using simple household items.

494
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:47,181
Really?

495
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:48,883
If one were so inclined.

496
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,326
Tyler, you are, by far,
the most interesting

497
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,925
"single-serving" friend I've ever met.

498
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,801
See, obviously,

499
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,736
everything on a plane
is single-serving, even-

500
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:05,002
Oh, I get it. It's very clever.

501
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,634
Thank you.

502
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,476
How's that working out for you?

503
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,481
What?

504
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,676
Being clever.

505
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:14,151
Great.

506
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,155
Keep it up, then.

507
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:17,155
Right up.

508
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,492
Now a question of etiquette.

509
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,652
As I pass,

510
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:23,161
do I give you the ass or the crotch?

511
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,497
How I came to live with Tyler is...

512
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:36,565
airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.

513
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:45,751
Was-Was it ticking?

514
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,186
Actually, throwers don't
worry about ticking,

515
00:24:48,256 --> 00:24:49,723
'cause modern bombs don't tick.

516
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,122
Sorry. "Throwers"?

517
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:52,352
Baggage handlers.

518
00:24:52,427 --> 00:24:55,624
But when a suitcase vibrates,

519
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:58,131
then the thrower's
gotta call the police.

520
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,827
My suitcase... was vibrating?

521
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:02,927
9 times out of 10,
it's an electric razor,

522
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:06,064
but every once in a while...

523
00:25:08,544 --> 00:25:10,136
it's a dildo.

524
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,304
Of course, it's company policy

525
00:25:13,382 --> 00:25:14,907
never to imply ownership

526
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:16,314
in the event of a dildo.

527
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:17,579
We have to use the indefinite article

528
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:18,642
a dildo.

529
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,053
Never your dildo.

530
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:23,148
I don't own a-

531
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:28,726
I had everything in that suitcase-

532
00:25:28,797 --> 00:25:30,007
my CK shirts,

533
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:31,768
my DKNY shoes,

534
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:33,138
my AX ties.

535
00:25:35,012 --> 00:25:36,104
Never mind.

536
00:25:37,715 --> 00:25:41,481
Hey! That's my car!

537
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:50,493
Home was a condo on the 15th floor

538
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:53,224
of a filing cabinet for
widows and young professionals.

539
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:55,960
The walls were solid concrete.

540
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,831
A foot of concrete's important

541
00:25:57,903 --> 00:25:59,564
when your next-door neighbor
lets her hearing aid go

542
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:02,072
and has to watch game
shows at full volume...

543
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,937
Or when a volcanic blast

544
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,740
and debris that used to be your
furniture and personal effects

545
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:08,609
blows out of your
floor-to-ceiling windows

546
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,443
and sails flaming into the night.

547
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:19,053
I suppose these things happen.

548
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:34,104
There's nothing up there.

549
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:36,471
You can't go into the unit.

550
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,839
Police orders.

551
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,519
Do you have somebody you can call?

552
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:51,123
How embarrassing.

553
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,025
A house full of condiments and no food.

554
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,473
The police would later tell me

555
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,270
that the pilot light
might have gone out,

556
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:11,280
Letting out just a little bit of gas.

557
00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:13,612
That gas could have
slowly filled the condo-

558
00:27:13,683 --> 00:27:16,209
1,700 square feet of high ceilings

559
00:27:16,287 --> 00:27:18,049
for days and days.

560
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:27,922
Then the refrigerator's
compressor could've clicked on.

561
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:32,293
Yeah?

562
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:37,065
I can hear you breathing, you-

563
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:48,447
If you asked me now,

564
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,351
I couldn't tell you why I called him.

565
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,495
Hello?

566
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:35,537
Who's this?

567
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:38,804
Tyler?

568
00:28:38,873 --> 00:28:40,432
Who is this?

569
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:43,238
Um, ahem, we met on the airplane.

570
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:45,245
We had the same suitcase.

571
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:48,542
Uh, the clever guy.

572
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:52,714
Oh, yeah. Right. OK?

573
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:54,584
I called a second ago.

574
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,648
There was no answer. I'm at a pay phone.

575
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:58,284
Yeah. I star-69ed you.

576
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,055
I never pick up my phone.

577
00:29:01,664 --> 00:29:03,461
So, what's up, man?

578
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:06,729
Uh, well...

579
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:09,236
you're not gonna believe this.

580
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:13,166
You know, man, it could be worse.

581
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:14,574
A woman could cut off your penis

582
00:29:14,645 --> 00:29:15,737
while you're sleeping

583
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:17,073
and toss it out the window

584
00:29:17,147 --> 00:29:18,273
of a moving car.

585
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:19,872
There's always that.

586
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,611
I don't know, it’s just...

587
00:29:21,685 --> 00:29:23,118
when you buy furniture,

588
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:24,585
you tell yourself, that's it.

589
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:26,418
That's the last sofa I'm gonna need.

590
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,753
Whatever else happens,

591
00:29:27,825 --> 00:29:29,883
I've got that sofa problem handled.

592
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,395
I had it all.

593
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:33,261
I had a stereo that was very decent,

594
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,926
a wardrobe that was
getting very respectable.

595
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:39,301
I was close to being complete.

596
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:40,770
Shit, man. Now it's all gone.

597
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,931
All gone.

598
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:44,704
Hmm. All gone.

599
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,068
Do you know what a duvet is?

600
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:49,274
Comforter.

601
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:51,045
It's a blanket.

602
00:29:51,118 --> 00:29:52,175
Just a blanket.

603
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:54,083
Why do guys like you and I

604
00:29:54,154 --> 00:29:55,122
know what a duvet is?

605
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:57,656
Is this essential to our survival

606
00:29:57,724 --> 00:29:59,282
in the hunter-gatherer
sense of the word?

607
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,657
No.

608
00:30:00,728 --> 00:30:03,161
What are we, then?

609
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:06,097
We're, uh, you know, consumers...

610
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,930
Right. We're consumers.

611
00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:11,403
We are by-products of
a lifestyle obsession.

612
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:13,770
Murder, crime, poverty-

613
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,570
these things don't concern me.

614
00:30:15,643 --> 00:30:18,874
What concerns me are
celebrity magazines,

615
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:21,073
television with 500 channels,

616
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:23,082
some guy's name on my underwear.

617
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,811
Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.

618
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:26,818
Martha Stewart.

619
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:28,013
Fuck Martha Stewart.

620
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:30,854
Martha's polishing the
brass on the Titanic.

621
00:30:30,926 --> 00:30:32,325
It's all going down, man.

622
00:30:32,394 --> 00:30:34,828
So fuck off with your sofa units

623
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:37,194
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

624
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:39,699
I say, never be complete.

625
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:41,360
I say, stop being perfect.

626
00:30:41,436 --> 00:30:43,961
I say, let's... let's evolve.

627
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,904
Let the chips fall where they may.

628
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:50,640
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

629
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:52,774
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

630
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,284
No. It’s just stuff.

631
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,340
It's not a tragedy, but...

632
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:56,511
Well, you did lose

633
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:59,182
a lot of versatile
solutions for modern living.

634
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,245
Fuck. You're right.

635
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:01,689
No. I don't smoke.

636
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,927
My insurance is probably
gonna cover it, so...

637
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:13,563
What?

638
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:17,768
The things you own end up owning you.

639
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,374
But do what you like, man.

640
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:24,974
Oh, it's late.

641
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,847
Hey, thanks for the beer.

642
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,181
Yeah, man.

643
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:31,121
I should find a hotel.

644
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,122
Oh.

645
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,124
What?

646
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:35,125
A hotel.

647
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:36,126
Yeah.

648
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,822
Just ask, man.

649
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,230
What are you talking about?

650
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,323
Oh, God.

651
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,833
3 pitchers of beer,

652
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,494
and you still can't ask.

653
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,197
What?

654
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,036
You called me 'cause you
needed a place to stay.

655
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,907
Oh, hey, no, no, no.

656
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:52,945
Yes, you did. So just ask.

657
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:55,311
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

658
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,347
Would that be a problem?

659
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,513
Is it a problem for you to ask?

660
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:04,422
Can I stay at your place?

661
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:05,423
Yeah.

662
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:07,893
Thanks.

663
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:14,098
I want you to do me a favor.

664
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,295
Yeah, sure.

665
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,204
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

666
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:20,242
What?

667
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,110
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

668
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,647
Let me tell you a little bit

669
00:32:25,715 --> 00:32:27,147
about Tyler Durden.

670
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:29,718
Tyler was a night person.

671
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:30,981
While the rest of us were sleeping,

672
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:32,078
he worked.

673
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:35,284
He had one part-time
job as a projectionist.

674
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,156
See, a movie doesn't
come all on one big reel.

675
00:32:37,228 --> 00:32:38,388
It comes on a few.

676
00:32:38,462 --> 00:32:40,953
So someone has to be there
to switch the projectors

677
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:43,261
at the exact moment that one reel ends

678
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,596
and the next one begins.

679
00:32:44,668 --> 00:32:46,659
If you look for it, you
can see these little dots

680
00:32:46,737 --> 00:32:48,762
come into the upper right-hand
corner of the screen.

681
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,898
In the industry,

682
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:52,272
we call them "cigarette burns."

683
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:54,403
That's the cue for a changeover.

684
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,911
He flips the projectors,

685
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,845
the movie keeps right on going,

686
00:32:57,915 --> 00:32:59,382
and nobody in the audience has any idea.

687
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:01,941
Why would anyone want this shit-job?

688
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:04,918
Because it affords him other
interesting opportunities.

689
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:07,019
Like splicing single
frames of pornography

690
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,485
into family films.

691
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:10,648
So when the snoot y cat
and the courageous dog

692
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:12,157
with the celebrity voices

693
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:14,216
meet for the first time in reel 3,

694
00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:15,523
that's when you'll catch a flash

695
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:17,893
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

696
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:26,263
Nobody knows that they saw it,

697
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:27,399
but they did.

698
00:33:27,475 --> 00:33:29,942
A nice big cock.

699
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:37,548
Even a hummingbird couldn't
catch Tyler at work.

700
00:33:42,325 --> 00:33:45,488
Tyler also works sometimes
as a banquet waiter

701
00:33:45,562 --> 00:33:47,894
at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

702
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,367
He was the guerilla terrorist

703
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:56,770
of the food service industry.

704
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:57,900
Do not watch.

705
00:33:57,976 --> 00:33:59,465
I cannot go when you watch.

706
00:33:59,543 --> 00:34:01,101
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,

707
00:34:01,178 --> 00:34:02,611
he farted on meringues,

708
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,113
sneezed on braised endive.

709
00:34:04,181 --> 00:34:05,739
And as for the cream of mushroom soup,

710
00:34:05,816 --> 00:34:06,908
well...

711
00:34:06,984 --> 00:34:08,418
Go ahead, tell them.

712
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:10,386
You get the idea.

713
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:12,149
What do you want me to do?
You just want me to hit you?

714
00:34:12,223 --> 00:34:13,816
Come on. Do me this one favor.

715
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:14,881
Why?

716
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,256
Why? I don't know why. I don't know.

717
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:17,294
I've never been in a fight. Have you?

718
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:18,794
No, but that's a good thing.

719
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:19,922
No, it is not.

720
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:20,930
How much can you know about yourself

721
00:34:20,998 --> 00:34:22,431
if you’ve never been in a fight?

722
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,797
I don't wanna die without any scars.

723
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:25,734
So, come on, hit me
before I lose my nerve.

724
00:34:25,804 --> 00:34:28,499
God, this is crazy.

725
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:30,165
So go crazy. Let 'er rip.

726
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:32,074
Hey, I don't know about this.

727
00:34:32,145 --> 00:34:34,374
I don't, either, but who gives a shit?

728
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:36,142
No one's watching. What do you care?

729
00:34:36,215 --> 00:34:38,444
Wait. This is crazy.
You want me to hit you?

730
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:40,452
That's right.

731
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,954
What, like, in the face?

732
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:44,386
Surprise me.

733
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:48,657
This is so fucking stupid.

734
00:34:57,705 --> 00:34:59,036
Ohh!

735
00:34:59,107 --> 00:35:01,940
Motherfucker!

736
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,944
You hit me in the ear.

737
00:35:04,012 --> 00:35:05,240
Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.

738
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:07,178
Ow! Christ!

739
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:08,943
Why the ear, man?

740
00:35:09,017 --> 00:35:10,075
Aw, I fucked it up.

741
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:11,175
No. That was perfect.

742
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:12,948
Ohh! Uhh!

743
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,224
Nah, it's all right.

744
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:28,861
That really hurts.

745
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:31,771
Right.

746
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:33,104
Hit me again.

747
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:35,276
No. You hit me.

748
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:36,368
Come on.

749
00:35:52,996 --> 00:35:55,397
We should do this again sometime.

750
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:09,637
Where's your car?

751
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:10,738
What car?

752
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:23,658
I don't know how Tyler found that house,

753
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,858
but he said he'd been there for a year.

754
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,992
It looked like it was
waiting to be torn down.

755
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:31,299
Most of the windows were boarded up.

756
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:33,636
There was no lock on the front door

757
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:37,007
from when the police
or whoever kicked it in.

758
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:38,772
The stairs were ready to collapse.

759
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:41,816
I didn't know if he owned
it or if he was squatting.

760
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:43,748
Neither would have surprised me.

761
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:46,418
Yeah. That's you.

762
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:47,614
That's me.

763
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,486
That's the toilet.

764
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:50,489
Good?

765
00:36:50,558 --> 00:36:51,490
Yeah. Thanks.

766
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:54,456
What a shit-hole.

767
00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:57,959
Nothing worked.

768
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:00,831
Turning on one light

769
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:03,837
meant another light
in the house went out.

770
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:05,338
There were no neighbors,

771
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:07,431
just some warehouses and a paper mill-

772
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:09,306
that fart smell of steam,

773
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:11,709
the hamster cage smell of wood chips.

774
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,806
After work tomorrow, we'll be-

775
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:15,851
Hey. What have we here?

776
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:31,798
Hey, guys.

777
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:32,961
Hey.

778
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:34,197
It's cool.

779
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:35,262
Ohh!

780
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:47,677
Every time it rained,
we had to kill the power.

781
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:49,276
By the end of the first month,

782
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:51,050
I didn't miss TV.

783
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:55,423
I didn't even mind the
warm, stale refrigerator.

784
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:09,905
Can I be next?

785
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:15,305
All right, man.

786
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:17,577
Lose the tie.

787
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:22,418
Ooh!

788
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:24,081
At night, Tyler and I were alone

789
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:26,421
for a half a mile in every direction.

790
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,834
Rain trickled down through the plaster

791
00:38:34,902 --> 00:38:36,335
and the light fixtures.

792
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:38,236
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.

793
00:38:38,307 --> 00:38:42,242
Everywhere were rusted
nails to snag your elbow on.

794
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,609
The previous occupant had
been a bit of a shut-in.

795
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,409
Hey, man, what are you reading?

796
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:48,539
Listen to this.

797
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:50,517
It's an article written by an organ

798
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:52,017
in the first person.

799
00:38:52,086 --> 00:38:54,649
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.

800
00:38:54,725 --> 00:38:56,352
Without me, Jack could not regulate

801
00:38:56,426 --> 00:38:58,587
his heart rate, blood
pressure, or breathing."

802
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:01,062
There's a whole series of these.

803
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,495
"I am Jill's nipples."

804
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:06,027
"I am Jack's colon."

805
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:08,502
Yeah. "I get cancer. I kill Jack."

806
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,769
Whoa-Ohh!

807
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:13,105
After fighting,

808
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:15,408
everything else in your life
got the volume turned down.

809
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:19,914
What?

810
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,417
You could deal with anything.

811
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:22,919
Have you finished those reports?

812
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:28,922
If you could fight anyone,

813
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:30,221
who would you fight?

814
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:32,729
I'd fight my boss, probably.

815
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:34,162
Really?

816
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:36,792
Yeah. Why, who would you fight?

817
00:39:36,868 --> 00:39:38,028
I'd fight my dad.

818
00:39:38,103 --> 00:39:39,900
I don't know my dad.

819
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:41,769
I mean, I know him,

820
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:44,673
but he left when I
was, like, 6 years old,

821
00:39:44,743 --> 00:39:47,178
married this other woman
and had some other kids.

822
00:39:47,246 --> 00:39:48,906
He, like, did this every 6 years.

823
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,847
He goes to a new city
and starts a new family.

824
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,044
Fucker should open up franchises.

825
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:57,113
My dad never went to college,

826
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:59,623
so it was real important that I go.

827
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:00,750
That sounds familiar.

828
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:02,954
So I graduate, I call
him up long distance.

829
00:40:03,029 --> 00:40:06,464
I say, "Dad, now what?"
He says, "Get a job."

830
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:07,464
Same here.

831
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:08,558
Now I'm 25.

832
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:09,966
I make my yearly call again.

833
00:40:10,036 --> 00:40:12,265
I say, "Dad, now what?"

834
00:40:12,338 --> 00:40:14,741
He says, "I don't know. Get married."

835
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,743
Eh, I mean...

836
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:18,039
I can't get married.

837
00:40:19,214 --> 00:40:20,875
I'm a
30-year-old boy.

838
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:22,472
We're a generation of men

839
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,710
raised by women.

840
00:40:23,785 --> 00:40:26,152
I'm wondering if another woman

841
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:28,018
is really the answer we need.

842
00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:36,693
Most of the week, we
were Ozzie and Harriet.

843
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:39,435
But every Saturday night,

844
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,803
we were finding something out.

845
00:40:42,872 --> 00:40:45,033
We were finding out more and more

846
00:40:45,107 --> 00:40:46,199
that we were not alone.

847
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:50,073
Who turned the lights off?

848
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:51,408
It used to be

849
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:53,142
that when I came home
angry or depressed,

850
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:54,877
l’d just clean my condo,

851
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:56,919
polish my Scandinavian furniture.

852
00:40:56,986 --> 00:40:59,386
I should've been
looking for a new condo.

853
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:02,186
I should've been haggling
with my insurance company.

854
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:06,058
I should've been upset about my
nice, neat flaming little shit.

855
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:07,619
But I wasn't.

856
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,096
The basic premise

857
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:10,962
of cyber-netting any office

858
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:12,126
is make things more efficient.

859
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:13,465
Monday mornings, all I could do

860
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:14,595
was think about next week.

861
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:17,835
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

862
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,069
Absolutely.

863
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,442
Efficiency is priority
number one, people,

864
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:25,312
because waste is a thief.

865
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:27,043
I showed this already to my man, here.

866
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,449
You liked it, didn't you?

867
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:34,154
You can swallow a pint of blood

868
00:41:34,227 --> 00:41:35,660
before you get sick.

869
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,521
It was right in everyone's face.

870
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,726
Tyler and I just made it visible.

871
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:44,031
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.

872
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:46,004
Tyler and I just gave it a name.

873
00:41:57,618 --> 00:42:00,451
Come on, people, you gotta go home.

874
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:23,977
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

875
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:48,270
Every week, Tyler gave the rules

876
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:49,635
that he and I decided.

877
00:42:49,706 --> 00:42:53,235
Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club.

878
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:58,046
The first rule of Fight Club is...

879
00:42:58,116 --> 00:43:00,584
you do not talk about Fight Club.

880
00:43:00,652 --> 00:43:03,450
The second rule of Fight Club is...

881
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:07,116
you do not talk about Fight Club.

882
00:43:07,192 --> 00:43:08,626
Third rule of Fight Club-

883
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:12,390
Someone yells "Stop!"
Goes limp, taps out,

884
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,990
the fight is over.

885
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:15,226
Fourth rule-

886
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,633
Only 2 guys to a fight.

887
00:43:17,703 --> 00:43:18,693
Fifth rule-

888
00:43:18,772 --> 00:43:21,239
One fight at a time, fellas.

889
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,936
Sixth rule
- No shirts, no shoes.

890
00:43:25,012 --> 00:43:26,103
Seventh rule-

891
00:43:26,178 --> 00:43:28,874
Fights will go on as
long as they have to.

892
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:33,317
And the eighth and final rule-

893
00:43:33,386 --> 00:43:37,846
If this is your first
night at Fight Club...

894
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:39,481
you have to fight.

895
00:43:44,063 --> 00:43:45,998
This kid from work, Rick y,

896
00:43:46,066 --> 00:43:47,897
couldn't remember
whether you ordered pens

897
00:43:47,968 --> 00:43:49,127
with blue ink or black...

898
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,729
Come on, man!

899
00:43:51,805 --> 00:43:53,501
But Ricky was a god for 10 minutes

900
00:43:53,574 --> 00:43:56,168
when the trounced the maitre
d' of a local food court.

901
00:43:58,379 --> 00:44:00,176
Sometimes, all you could hear

902
00:44:00,248 --> 00:44:02,478
were the flat, hard packing sounds

903
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:03,642
over the yelling...

904
00:44:07,088 --> 00:44:10,057
or the wet choke when
someone caught their breath

905
00:44:10,124 --> 00:44:11,056
and sprayed...

906
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:12,285
Stop!

907
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,297
You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.

908
00:44:15,365 --> 00:44:16,730
But Fight Club only exists

909
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,030
in the hours between
when Fight Club starts

910
00:44:19,102 --> 00:44:20,933
and when Fight Club ends.

911
00:44:21,004 --> 00:44:24,098
Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,

912
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:26,074
I wouldn't be talking to the same man.

913
00:44:26,142 --> 00:44:27,701
Who you were in Fight Club

914
00:44:27,778 --> 00:44:29,870
is not who you were in
the rest of the world.

915
00:44:29,946 --> 00:44:32,814
The guy who came to Fight
Club for the first time,

916
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:34,875
his ass was a wad of cookie dough.

917
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:36,249
After a few weeks,

918
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,878
he was carved out of wood.

919
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:39,981
If you could fight any celebrity,

920
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:41,490
who would you fight?

921
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:42,617
Alive or dead?

922
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:45,162
It doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

923
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,060
Hemingway.

924
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:49,657
You?

925
00:44:49,735 --> 00:44:50,827
Shatner.

926
00:44:50,902 --> 00:44:53,096
I'd fight William Shatner.

927
00:44:54,606 --> 00:44:57,166
We all started seeing
things differently.

928
00:44:57,242 --> 00:44:59,004
Everywhere we went,

929
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:01,238
we were sizing things up.

930
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,041
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,

931
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,554
trying to look like how Calvin Klein

932
00:45:10,622 --> 00:45:12,487
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.

933
00:45:12,557 --> 00:45:14,048
Is that what a man looks like?

934
00:45:15,194 --> 00:45:18,129
Ahh. Self-improvement is masturbation.

935
00:45:18,197 --> 00:45:20,598
And self-destruction.

936
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:22,190
Excuse me.

937
00:45:33,346 --> 00:45:34,781
Kick his ass!

938
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:36,317
Hit him again, man! Come on! Hit him!

939
00:45:56,438 --> 00:45:59,806
Fight Club wasn't
about winning or losing.

940
00:45:59,876 --> 00:46:01,866
It wasn't about words.

941
00:46:04,748 --> 00:46:07,147
The hysterical shouting was in tongues,

942
00:46:07,216 --> 00:46:09,378
Like in a Pentecostal church.

943
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:15,758
- Is that it?
- Stop!

944
00:46:15,826 --> 00:46:17,817
When the fight was over,

945
00:46:17,894 --> 00:46:19,828
nothing was solved,

946
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:21,386
but nothing mattered.

947
00:46:21,464 --> 00:46:22,897
Hey, cool.

948
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:28,630
Afterwards, we all felt saved.

949
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,798
Hey, man, how about next week?

950
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,307
How about next month?

951
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:33,569
I hear you.

952
00:46:33,643 --> 00:46:34,805
Irwin, you're in the middle.

953
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,211
New guy. You, too.

954
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:41,079
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.

955
00:46:41,153 --> 00:46:43,120
He fell down some stairs.

956
00:46:43,187 --> 00:46:45,748
I fell down some stairs.

957
00:46:47,925 --> 00:46:50,257
Fight Club became the
reason to cut your hair short

958
00:46:50,328 --> 00:46:52,660
or trim your fingernails.

959
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,200
OK. Any historical figure.

960
00:46:55,268 --> 00:46:57,100
I'd fight Gandhi.

961
00:46:58,705 --> 00:46:59,637
Good answer.

962
00:46:59,706 --> 00:47:00,764
How about you?

963
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,967
Lincoln.

964
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:03,441
Lincoln?

965
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,635
Mm.

966
00:47:04,711 --> 00:47:06,110
Big guy, big reach.

967
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:08,410
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

968
00:47:08,482 --> 00:47:09,880
Fuck.

969
00:47:12,052 --> 00:47:14,817
Hey. Even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

970
00:47:23,598 --> 00:47:25,190
Hello.

971
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:26,256
Where have you been

972
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:28,165
the last 8 weeks?

973
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:29,533
Marla?

974
00:47:32,742 --> 00:47:34,174
How'd you find me?

975
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:35,675
You left that forwarding number.

976
00:47:35,744 --> 00:47:38,577
I haven't seen you
in any support groups.

977
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,080
We split them up.

978
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,116
That was the idea, remember?

979
00:47:42,183 --> 00:47:44,981
Yeah, but you haven't
been going to yours.

980
00:47:45,053 --> 00:47:46,748
How do you know?

981
00:47:46,821 --> 00:47:48,550
I cheated.

982
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:50,420
I found a new one.

983
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,255
Really?

984
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,316
It's for men only.

985
00:47:53,395 --> 00:47:54,989
Like the testicle thing?

986
00:47:55,065 --> 00:47:56,190
Waaah!

987
00:47:59,436 --> 00:48:00,767
Look, this is a bad time.

988
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:03,327
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

989
00:48:03,406 --> 00:48:05,500
You wanna see some
really fucked up people?

990
00:48:05,575 --> 00:48:06,940
I'm just on my way out.

991
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:07,941
Me, too.

992
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,999
I've got a stomach-full of Xanax.

993
00:48:09,078 --> 00:48:11,809
I took what was left of a bottle.

994
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:13,940
It might have been too much.

995
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,782
Just picture watching Marla Singer

996
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:17,736
throw herself around
her crummy apartment.

997
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:19,860
But this isn't a
for-real suicide thing.

998
00:48:19,937 --> 00:48:22,270
This is probably one of
those cry-for-help things.

999
00:48:22,341 --> 00:48:23,774
This could go on for hours.

1000
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:25,274
So you're staying in tonight, then?

1001
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,777
Do you wanna wait

1002
00:48:26,845 --> 00:48:28,210
and hear me describe death?

1003
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,713
Do you wanna listen

1004
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:33,115
and see if my spirit can use a phone?

1005
00:48:34,687 --> 00:48:37,622
Have you ever heard
a death rattle before?

1006
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:05,541
Tyler's door was closed.

1007
00:49:05,618 --> 00:49:07,142
I'd been living here for 2 months,

1008
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,745
and Tyler's door was never closed.

1009
00:49:14,996 --> 00:49:17,156
You won't believe this
dream I had last night.

1010
00:49:17,231 --> 00:49:20,224
Yeah, I can hardly believe
anything about last night.

1011
00:49:30,078 --> 00:49:31,978
What-What are you doing here?

1012
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:36,845
What?

1013
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,319
This is my house. What
are you doing in my house?

1014
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:42,826
Fuck you.

1015
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:58,335
Ha ha! Ohh...

1016
00:49:58,409 --> 00:50:01,777
Oh, you got some fucked-up
friends, I'm tellin' you.

1017
00:50:02,847 --> 00:50:04,474
Limber, though...

1018
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:05,846
silly coos.

1019
00:50:07,553 --> 00:50:09,986
So, I come in last night.
Phone's off the hook.

1020
00:50:10,054 --> 00:50:11,886
Guess who's on the other end.

1021
00:50:11,957 --> 00:50:14,117
I already knew the story
before he told it to me.

1022
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,061
Have you ever heard
a death rattle before?

1023
00:50:20,131 --> 00:50:22,999
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

1024
00:50:23,068 --> 00:50:27,060
Or will it just be a death... hairball?

1025
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:34,042
Prepare... to evacuate soul.

1026
00:50:36,016 --> 00:50:37,642
9...

1027
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:38,684
8...

1028
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:41,084
Now, how could Tyler, of all people,

1029
00:50:41,154 --> 00:50:45,284
think it was a bad thing that
Marla Singer was about to die?

1030
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:47,258
5...

1031
00:50:47,327 --> 00:50:49,227
4...

1032
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,059
3... Oh, hang on.

1033
00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:58,897
You got here fast.

1034
00:51:00,509 --> 00:51:02,636
Did I call you?

1035
00:51:04,313 --> 00:51:05,245
Huh?

1036
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:07,313
Hey.

1037
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:16,386
The mattress is all
sealed in slippery plastic.

1038
00:51:19,662 --> 00:51:22,893
Oh, don't worry. It's
not a threat to you.

1039
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:26,767
Oh, fuck.

1040
00:51:26,837 --> 00:51:29,066
Somebody called the cops.

1041
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,582
Hey, where's 513?

1042
00:51:42,653 --> 00:51:45,087
End of the hall.

1043
00:51:45,155 --> 00:51:46,644
You know, the girl who lives there

1044
00:51:46,723 --> 00:51:49,056
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

1045
00:51:49,126 --> 00:51:51,320
She's lost faith in herself.

1046
00:51:51,394 --> 00:51:52,327
Miss Singer!

1047
00:51:52,396 --> 00:51:54,227
She's a monster.

1048
00:51:54,298 --> 00:51:55,926
You have every reason to live!

1049
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:58,435
She's infectious human waste!

1050
00:51:58,503 --> 00:51:59,435
Miss Singer!

1051
00:51:59,504 --> 00:52:01,472
Good luck trying to save her!

1052
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,574
If I fall asleep, I'm done for.

1053
00:52:13,018 --> 00:52:15,921
You're gonna have to keep me up...

1054
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:17,980
all... night.

1055
00:52:18,058 --> 00:52:20,424
Un-fucking-believable.

1056
00:52:20,494 --> 00:52:22,655
He was obviously able to handle it.

1057
00:52:22,729 --> 00:52:23,890
You know what I mean. You fucked her.

1058
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:26,460
No, I didn't.

1059
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,023
Never?

1060
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:29,033
No.

1061
00:52:30,405 --> 00:52:31,666
You're not into her, are you?

1062
00:52:31,738 --> 00:52:34,138
No! God, not at all.

1063
00:52:34,207 --> 00:52:36,541
I am Jack’s raging bile duct.

1064
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,602
Are you sure? You can tell me.

1065
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:40,170
Believe me, I'm sure.

1066
00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:41,216
Put a gun to my head

1067
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,147
and paint the walls with my brains.

1068
00:52:43,217 --> 00:52:44,411
That's good, 'cause she's a predator

1069
00:52:44,485 --> 00:52:45,885
posing as a house pet.

1070
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,979
Stay away from that one.

1071
00:52:49,957 --> 00:52:51,391
And the shit that came
out of this woman's mouth

1072
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,392
I ain't never heard.

1073
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,655
My God.

1074
00:52:53,729 --> 00:52:56,596
I haven't been fucked like
that since grade school.

1075
00:52:57,699 --> 00:52:58,723
Uhh!

1076
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,597
How could Tyler not go for that?

1077
00:53:00,668 --> 00:53:02,136
The night before last, he was splicing

1078
00:53:02,204 --> 00:53:04,001
sex organs into Cinderella.

1079
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:05,131
Marla doesn't need a lover.

1080
00:53:05,207 --> 00:53:06,674
She needs a fucking case worker.

1081
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:09,370
She needs a wash. And she's
in love with sport fuckin'.

1082
00:53:09,445 --> 00:53:11,572
She invaded my support groups.

1083
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,080
Now she'd invaded my home.

1084
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,082
Hey, hey. Sit down.

1085
00:53:19,389 --> 00:53:22,017
Now, listen. Can't have
you talking to her about me.

1086
00:53:22,093 --> 00:53:23,423
Why would I talk to her-

1087
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:25,484
You say anything about me
or what goes on in this house

1088
00:53:25,562 --> 00:53:28,895
to her or to anybody, we're done.

1089
00:53:28,965 --> 00:53:30,159
Now, promise me.

1090
00:53:30,233 --> 00:53:31,165
OK.

1091
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:32,166
You promise?

1092
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:34,101
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise.

1093
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:35,662
I just said I promise.

1094
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,332
That's 3 times you promised.

1095
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:41,644
If only I had wasted a couple of minutes

1096
00:53:41,713 --> 00:53:43,875
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,

1097
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,508
none of this would've happened.

1098
00:53:45,585 --> 00:53:48,451
Unhh! Unhh! Unhh!

1099
00:53:48,521 --> 00:53:49,453
Unhh!

1100
00:53:50,523 --> 00:53:52,990
Yeah! Oh! Harder! Harder!

1101
00:53:53,058 --> 00:53:55,027
Yeah! Ooh! Aah!

1102
00:53:55,094 --> 00:53:57,722
Aah! Ohh! Aah!

1103
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:03,467
I could've moved to another room...

1104
00:54:03,536 --> 00:54:06,404
on the third floor, where
I might not have heard them.

1105
00:54:06,473 --> 00:54:07,405
Oh, baby!

1106
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:09,100
But I didn't.

1107
00:54:17,885 --> 00:54:18,817
Ohh!

1108
00:54:18,886 --> 00:54:22,287
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1109
00:54:22,356 --> 00:54:24,517
Ohh! Ohh! Aaahh!

1110
00:54:24,591 --> 00:54:26,582
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1111
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:30,725
- Aah! Ohhh! Ohh!
- Ow!

1112
00:54:31,832 --> 00:54:32,764
Ohh!

1113
00:54:33,834 --> 00:54:35,461
What are you doin'?

1114
00:54:35,536 --> 00:54:37,903
Just goin' to bed.

1115
00:54:38,973 --> 00:54:40,406
Want to finish her off?

1116
00:54:40,475 --> 00:54:41,407
Uhh... oh!

1117
00:54:42,578 --> 00:54:43,509
No.

1118
00:54:43,578 --> 00:54:44,510
No, thank you.

1119
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,513
I found the cigarettes.

1120
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:48,846
Who are you talking to?

1121
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:49,975
Shut up.

1122
00:54:50,051 --> 00:54:53,021
I became the calm little
center of the world.

1123
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:56,016
I was the Zen master.

1124
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,788
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1125
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:03,963
I wrote little haiku poems.

1126
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:05,764
I e-mailed them to everyone.

1127
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,266
Is that your blood?

1128
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,106
Some of it, yeah.

1129
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,700
You can't smoke in here.

1130
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:17,177
Take the rest of the day off.

1131
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:19,809
Come back Monday with
some clean clothes.

1132
00:55:19,885 --> 00:55:21,318
Get yourself together.

1133
00:55:21,386 --> 00:55:24,480
I got right in everyone's
hostile little face.

1134
00:55:24,556 --> 00:55:26,820
Yes, these are bruises from fighting.

1135
00:55:26,892 --> 00:55:28,985
Yes, I'm comfortable with that.

1136
00:55:29,061 --> 00:55:30,528
I... am enlightened.

1137
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:34,927
You give up the condo life...

1138
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,833
give up all your flaming
worldly possessions...

1139
00:55:37,903 --> 00:55:39,598
go live in a dilapidated house

1140
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:41,798
in a toxic waste part of town...

1141
00:55:41,873 --> 00:55:44,171
and you have to come home to this.

1142
00:55:44,243 --> 00:55:45,506
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1143
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:53,409
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1144
00:55:56,156 --> 00:55:57,088
Hello?

1145
00:55:57,157 --> 00:55:58,521
Yes. This is Detective Stern

1146
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:00,422
with the Arson Unit.

1147
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:01,688
We have some new information

1148
00:56:01,762 --> 00:56:04,127
about the incident at your former condo.

1149
00:56:04,197 --> 00:56:05,221
Yes?

1150
00:56:05,298 --> 00:56:06,459
I don't know if you’re aware,

1151
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:08,865
but it seems that someone sprayed Freon

1152
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:10,232
into your front door lock,

1153
00:56:10,303 --> 00:56:13,603
then tapped it with a chisel
to shatter the cylinder.

1154
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:15,265
No, I wasn't aware of that at all.

1155
00:56:15,341 --> 00:56:17,174
I am Jack’s cold sweat.

1156
00:56:17,308 --> 00:56:19,435
Does this sound strange to you?

1157
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,409
Uh, yes, sir. Strange. Very strange.

1158
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:22,410
The dynamite-

1159
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,411
Dynamite?

1160
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,538
Left a residue

1161
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:27,743
of ammonium oxalate potassium chloride.

1162
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,786
Do you know what this means?

1163
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,320
No. What does it mean?

1164
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,288
It means it was homemade.

1165
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:36,015
I'm sorry. This is just coming

1166
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:37,652
as quite a shock to me, sir.

1167
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:39,697
See, whoever set this homemade dynamite

1168
00:56:39,764 --> 00:56:41,322
could've blown out your pilot light

1169
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,265
days before the actual explosion.

1170
00:56:43,336 --> 00:56:45,166
The gas was just the detonator.

1171
00:56:45,237 --> 00:56:46,636
Who would go and do such a thing?

1172
00:56:46,705 --> 00:56:47,967
I'll ask the questions.

1173
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:50,303
Tell him. Tell him the liberator

1174
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:53,105
who destroyed my property
has realigned my perception.

1175
00:56:53,178 --> 00:56:54,840
Excuse me. Are you there?

1176
00:56:54,914 --> 00:56:56,847
No, I am listening. It's
a little hard to know

1177
00:56:56,915 --> 00:56:58,280
what to make of all this.

1178
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,478
Have you recently made
enemies with anyone

1179
00:57:00,553 --> 00:57:02,850
who might have access
to homemade dynamite?

1180
00:57:02,921 --> 00:57:04,013
- Enemies?
- Reject the basic

1181
00:57:04,089 --> 00:57:05,523
assumption of civilization,

1182
00:57:05,591 --> 00:57:07,387
especially the importance
of material possessions.

1183
00:57:07,459 --> 00:57:08,892
Son, this is serious.

1184
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,326
Yes, I know it's serious.

1185
00:57:10,396 --> 00:57:11,328
I mean that.

1186
00:57:11,397 --> 00:57:12,988
Yes, it's very serious.

1187
00:57:13,064 --> 00:57:16,000
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

1188
00:57:16,068 --> 00:57:18,366
That condo was my life.

1189
00:57:18,437 --> 00:57:22,397
OK? I loved every stick
of furniture in that place.

1190
00:57:22,476 --> 00:57:24,375
That was not just a bunch of stuff

1191
00:57:24,443 --> 00:57:25,536
that got destroyed.

1192
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:26,636
It was me!

1193
00:57:26,713 --> 00:57:28,146
I'd like to thank the Academy.

1194
00:57:28,215 --> 00:57:29,875
Is this not a good time for you?

1195
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:31,713
Just tell him you fuckin' did it.

1196
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:32,717
Shhh!

1197
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:34,310
Tell him you blew it all up.

1198
00:57:34,388 --> 00:57:36,950
That's what he wants to hear.

1199
00:57:37,026 --> 00:57:38,288
Are you still there?

1200
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,954
Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?

1201
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:43,624
No, no. I may need to talk
to you a little further,

1202
00:57:43,699 --> 00:57:45,633
so how about you just lettin' me
know if you’re gonna leave town?

1203
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:46,794
OK?

1204
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:47,961
OK.

1205
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,734
Except for their humping,

1206
00:57:52,808 --> 00:57:55,572
Tyler and Marla were
never in the same room.

1207
00:57:55,644 --> 00:57:58,671
My parents pulled this
exact same act for years.

1208
00:57:58,748 --> 00:58:02,583
The condom is the glass
slipper of our generation.

1209
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:05,587
You slip one on when
you meet a stranger.

1210
00:58:05,655 --> 00:58:08,056
You... dance all night.

1211
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:10,285
Then you throw it away.

1212
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,760
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

1213
00:58:14,165 --> 00:58:15,631
What?

1214
00:58:20,504 --> 00:58:23,301
I got this dress at a
thrift store for $1.00.

1215
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:25,274
It was worth every penny.

1216
00:58:25,343 --> 00:58:27,242
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

1217
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,771
Someone loved it... intensely

1218
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:34,282
for one day...

1219
00:58:34,352 --> 00:58:35,819
then tossed it.

1220
00:58:37,923 --> 00:58:40,118
Like a Christmas tree...

1221
00:58:40,192 --> 00:58:41,682
so special...

1222
00:58:42,928 --> 00:58:45,488
then... bam...

1223
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,124
it's on the side of the road...

1224
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,464
tinsel still clinging to it...

1225
00:58:52,371 --> 00:58:55,272
Like a sex crime victim...

1226
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,867
underwear inside out...

1227
00:58:57,945 --> 00:58:59,776
bound with electrical tape.

1228
00:58:59,847 --> 00:59:01,110
Well, then it suits you.

1229
00:59:02,349 --> 00:59:04,180
You can borrow it sometime.

1230
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:12,920
Get rid of her.

1231
00:59:14,161 --> 00:59:15,423
Why can't you get rid of her?

1232
00:59:15,496 --> 00:59:16,657
Don't mention me.

1233
00:59:16,731 --> 00:59:18,256
I'm 6 years old again,

1234
00:59:18,334 --> 00:59:20,563
passing messages between parents.

1235
00:59:24,506 --> 00:59:26,098
I really think it's
time you got out of here.

1236
00:59:26,174 --> 00:59:27,403
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

1237
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:28,408
Not that we don't love
your little visits.

1238
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:29,876
You are such a nut case.

1239
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:31,468
I can't even begin to keep up.

1240
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:36,279
<i>Gotta get off</i>

1241
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:37,443
Thanks. Bye.

1242
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:43,356
<i>Gotta get off
this merry-go-round</i>

1243
00:59:48,464 --> 00:59:50,523
<i>Gotta get on where</i>

1244
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:54,100
You kids.

1245
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,402
Wh... Why do you still
waste time with her?

1246
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:01,199
I'll say this about Marla-

1247
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:03,405
at least she's tryin' to hit bottom.

1248
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,811
What, and I'm not?

1249
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:05,973
Stickin' feathers up your butt

1250
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:07,073
does not make you a chicken.

1251
01:00:08,552 --> 01:00:09,884
What are we doin' tonight?

1252
01:00:09,954 --> 01:00:11,648
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

1253
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:13,712
We make soap.

1254
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:14,883
Really.

1255
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:16,016
To make soap, first we render fat.

1256
01:00:36,575 --> 01:00:38,441
The salt balance has to be just right,

1257
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:41,206
so the best fat for making
soap comes from humans.

1258
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:43,543
Wait. What is this place?

1259
01:00:43,617 --> 01:00:45,083
A liposuction clinic.

1260
01:00:53,426 --> 01:00:54,484
Aha! Pay dirt.

1261
01:00:55,595 --> 01:00:58,723
The richest, creamiest fat in the world.

1262
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:00,197
Fat of the land.

1263
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,573
Come on.

1264
01:01:13,147 --> 01:01:14,670
Oh, God! Oh!

1265
01:01:14,748 --> 01:01:16,375
Get another one. Unhh!

1266
01:01:22,957 --> 01:01:25,050
As the fat renders, the
tallows float to the surface.

1267
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:26,889
Like in Boy Scouts.

1268
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:29,362
I can imagine you as a Boy Scout.

1269
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:30,420
Keep stirrin'.

1270
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:34,699
Once the tallow hardens,

1271
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,964
we skim off a layer of glycerin.

1272
01:01:37,038 --> 01:01:39,372
If you were to add nitric
acid, you got nitroglycerin.

1273
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:40,705
If you were then to add sodium nitrate

1274
01:01:40,778 --> 01:01:43,405
and a dash of sawdust, you got dynamite.

1275
01:01:43,479 --> 01:01:45,277
Yeah, with enough soap,

1276
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:47,647
we could blow up just about anything.

1277
01:01:47,718 --> 01:01:49,651
Tyler was full of useful information.

1278
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:52,120
Now, ancient peoples found
that clothes got cleaner

1279
01:01:52,189 --> 01:01:53,985
when they washed them at a
certain point in the river.

1280
01:01:54,057 --> 01:01:55,616
- You know why?
- No.

1281
01:01:59,296 --> 01:02:00,855
Human sacrifices were once made

1282
01:02:00,932 --> 01:02:02,297
on the hills above this river.

1283
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:04,528
Bodies burned. Water seeped
into the wood and ashes

1284
01:02:04,602 --> 01:02:06,263
to create lye.

1285
01:02:06,337 --> 01:02:08,635
This is lye, the crucial ingredient.

1286
01:02:08,707 --> 01:02:10,436
Once it mixed with the
melted fat of bodies,

1287
01:02:10,508 --> 01:02:11,975
a thick, white, soapy discharge

1288
01:02:12,043 --> 01:02:14,443
crept into the river. May
I see your hand, please?

1289
01:02:22,587 --> 01:02:23,781
What is this?

1290
01:02:23,855 --> 01:02:25,288
This... is chemical burn.

1291
01:02:25,356 --> 01:02:26,448
Uh-Aah! Aah!

1292
01:02:26,524 --> 01:02:28,389
It'll hurt more than
you've ever been burned,

1293
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,018
and you will have a scar.

1294
01:02:30,095 --> 01:02:33,497
If meditation worked for
cancer, it could work for this.

1295
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:35,328
Stay with the pain.
Don't shove to center.

1296
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,027
No, no! Oh, God!

1297
01:02:37,102 --> 01:02:38,503
Look at your hand.

1298
01:02:38,572 --> 01:02:39,936
The first soap was made
from the ashes of heroes,

1299
01:02:40,005 --> 01:02:41,563
Like the first monkey shot into space.

1300
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,302
Without pain, without sacrifice,

1301
01:02:43,376 --> 01:02:44,673
we would have nothin'.

1302
01:02:44,745 --> 01:02:47,679
I tried not to think of the
the words "sear" or "flesh."

1303
01:02:47,747 --> 01:02:49,272
Stop it! This is your pain.

1304
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:50,907
This is your burning
hand. It's right here.

1305
01:02:50,983 --> 01:02:52,041
I'm going to my cave.

1306
01:02:52,118 --> 01:02:53,677
I'm going to my cave
and find my power animal.

1307
01:02:53,754 --> 01:02:56,813
No! Don't deal with it the
way those dead people do!

1308
01:02:56,889 --> 01:02:57,823
Come on!

1309
01:02:57,892 --> 01:02:59,053
I get the point! OK! Please!

1310
01:02:59,128 --> 01:03:00,720
No. What you're feeling
is premature enlightenment.

1311
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,265
This is the greatest
moment of your life, man,

1312
01:03:07,336 --> 01:03:10,362
and you're off somewhere-

1313
01:03:10,439 --> 01:03:11,906
Shut up.

1314
01:03:11,974 --> 01:03:13,441
Our fathers were our models for God.

1315
01:03:13,509 --> 01:03:14,770
If our fathers bailed,

1316
01:03:14,843 --> 01:03:16,640
what does that tell you about God?

1317
01:03:16,712 --> 01:03:17,645
No, no.

1318
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:19,409
Listen to me.

1319
01:03:19,482 --> 01:03:21,416
You have to consider the possibility

1320
01:03:21,484 --> 01:03:23,543
that God does not like you,

1321
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:24,678
He never wanted you.

1322
01:03:24,754 --> 01:03:27,120
In all probability, He hates you.

1323
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:29,021
This is not the worst
thing that can happen.

1324
01:03:29,092 --> 01:03:30,788
We don't need Him.

1325
01:03:30,861 --> 01:03:31,884
We don't! I agree!

1326
01:03:31,961 --> 01:03:33,758
Fuck damnation, man. Fuck redemption.

1327
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:35,263
We are God's unwanted children?

1328
01:03:35,331 --> 01:03:36,424
So be it!

1329
01:03:37,867 --> 01:03:39,698
Listen! You can run water over your hand

1330
01:03:39,769 --> 01:03:42,068
to make it worse,
or- Look at me-

1331
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:44,402
or you can use vinegar
to neutralize the burn.

1332
01:03:44,474 --> 01:03:45,702
Please let me have some! Please!

1333
01:03:45,775 --> 01:03:47,403
First you have to give up.

1334
01:03:47,478 --> 01:03:50,776
First you have to know, not fear,

1335
01:03:50,847 --> 01:03:53,749
know that someday you're gonna die.

1336
01:03:53,818 --> 01:03:55,580
You don't know how this feels!

1337
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:02,118
It's only after we've lost everything

1338
01:04:02,193 --> 01:04:04,219
that we're free to do anything.

1339
01:04:06,197 --> 01:04:07,129
OK.

1340
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:23,678
Congratulations.

1341
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:26,617
You're one step closer
to hitting bottom.

1342
01:04:29,089 --> 01:04:31,216
Tyler sold his soap to department stores

1343
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:33,054
at $20 a bar.

1344
01:04:33,126 --> 01:04:34,491
God knows what they charged.

1345
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:37,223
This is the best soap.

1346
01:04:37,297 --> 01:04:38,822
Why, thank you, Suzie.

1347
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,390
It was beautiful.

1348
01:04:40,468 --> 01:04:41,867
We were selling rich women

1349
01:04:41,936 --> 01:04:44,234
their own fat asses back to them.

1350
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,367
He was wearing his yellow tie.

1351
01:04:47,442 --> 01:04:50,036
I didn't even wear a
tie to work anymore.

1352
01:04:50,112 --> 01:04:51,703
"The first rule of Fight Club

1353
01:04:51,779 --> 01:04:53,474
is you don't talk about Fight Club"?

1354
01:04:53,548 --> 01:04:55,209
I'm half asleep again.

1355
01:04:55,283 --> 01:04:57,115
I must've left the original
in the copy machine.

1356
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,676
"The second rule of Fight Club
- " is this yours?

1357
01:04:59,754 --> 01:05:01,484
Huh?

1358
01:05:01,557 --> 01:05:03,046
Pretend you're me.

1359
01:05:03,124 --> 01:05:04,887
Make a managerial decision.

1360
01:05:04,959 --> 01:05:07,588
You find this. What would you do?

1361
01:05:12,301 --> 01:05:14,235
Well, I gotta tell ya...

1362
01:05:14,303 --> 01:05:17,830
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

1363
01:05:17,907 --> 01:05:19,603
Because the person who wrote that...

1364
01:05:19,676 --> 01:05:21,404
is dangerous.

1365
01:05:21,477 --> 01:05:24,379
And this buttoned-down,
oxford-cloth psycho

1366
01:05:24,447 --> 01:05:26,004
might just snap

1367
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:28,676
and then stalk from office to office

1368
01:05:28,752 --> 01:05:32,449
with an Armilade AR-10
carbine gas-powered

1369
01:05:32,522 --> 01:05:34,080
semi-automatic weapon,

1370
01:05:34,157 --> 01:05:36,022
pumping round after round

1371
01:05:36,092 --> 01:05:37,992
into colleagues and coworkers.

1372
01:05:39,298 --> 01:05:42,699
This might be someone
you've known for years...

1373
01:05:42,768 --> 01:05:46,135
someone very... very... close to you.

1374
01:05:46,204 --> 01:05:49,298
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.

1375
01:05:51,076 --> 01:05:52,839
And I used to be such a nice guy.

1376
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:55,175
Maybe you shouldn't bring me
every little piece of trash

1377
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:56,874
you happen to pick up.

1378
01:05:59,687 --> 01:06:01,551
Liability.

1379
01:06:01,621 --> 01:06:03,316
My tit's gonna rot off.

1380
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:06,815
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

1381
01:06:13,132 --> 01:06:14,531
What're you talking about?

1382
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,796
I need you to check and see
if there's a lump in my breast.

1383
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,496
Go to a hospital.

1384
01:06:18,571 --> 01:06:20,767
I can't afford to throw
money away on a doctor.

1385
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:24,037
I don't know about this, Marla.

1386
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:25,806
Please?

1387
01:06:25,879 --> 01:06:27,608
She didn't call Tyler.

1388
01:06:27,681 --> 01:06:29,841
I'm neutral in her book.

1389
01:06:32,086 --> 01:06:33,178
That's nice.

1390
01:06:33,253 --> 01:06:34,810
Taking food to Mrs...

1391
01:06:34,887 --> 01:06:36,253
Hanna burr, Mrs. Raines?

1392
01:06:36,323 --> 01:06:37,688
Who are they... exactly?

1393
01:06:37,758 --> 01:06:39,522
Tragically, they're dead.

1394
01:06:39,594 --> 01:06:41,391
I'm alive, and I'm in poverty.

1395
01:06:41,463 --> 01:06:42,395
You want any?

1396
01:06:42,464 --> 01:06:43,396
No. No.

1397
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:44,762
I got one for you.

1398
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:46,197
Thanks for the thought.

1399
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:50,367
What happened to your hand?

1400
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:51,598
Uh... nothin'.

1401
01:06:52,707 --> 01:06:53,639
Right there.

1402
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:54,640
Uhh.

1403
01:06:55,944 --> 01:06:57,378
Feel anything?

1404
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:58,377
No.

1405
01:06:58,448 --> 01:06:59,710
Well, make sure.

1406
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,711
Ok, I'm
- I'm pretty sure.

1407
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:04,845
You feel nothing.

1408
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:06,946
No. Nothing.

1409
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,893
Well, that's a relief.

1410
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:12,223
Thank you.

1411
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:14,230
Uh, um... no problem.

1412
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:16,424
I wish I could return the favor.

1413
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,595
There's not a lot of breast
cancer in the men in my family.

1414
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:20,103
Could check your prostate.

1415
01:07:20,172 --> 01:07:22,162
I think I'm OK.

1416
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,175
Well, thanks, anyway.

1417
01:07:29,248 --> 01:07:30,476
Are we done?

1418
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:33,915
Yeah, we're done. See you... around.

1419
01:07:51,256 --> 01:07:52,188
Cornelius?

1420
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:54,290
Cornelius!

1421
01:07:55,761 --> 01:07:57,058
It's me...

1422
01:07:57,129 --> 01:07:58,494
Bob!

1423
01:07:58,564 --> 01:07:59,964
Hey... Bob.

1424
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:03,529
Hey. Uhh!

1425
01:08:03,603 --> 01:08:04,797
We all thought you were dead.

1426
01:08:04,871 --> 01:08:07,032
No, no. Still here.

1427
01:08:07,106 --> 01:08:09,040
How are you, Bob?

1428
01:08:09,108 --> 01:08:10,939
Better than I've ever
been in my whole life.

1429
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:13,706
Really. You still
remaining men together?

1430
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:15,873
No, no. I got somethin'
so much better now.

1431
01:08:15,949 --> 01:08:17,440
Really. What is it?

1432
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,649
Well...

1433
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:22,816
first rule is...

1434
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:24,722
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

1435
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,226
And the second rule is,

1436
01:08:27,296 --> 01:08:29,025
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

1437
01:08:29,098 --> 01:08:30,689
And the third rule is...

1438
01:08:30,765 --> 01:08:33,166
Bob. Bob. I'm a member.

1439
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:35,759
Look at my face, Bob.

1440
01:08:37,907 --> 01:08:40,069
That's fuckin'
- That's fuckin' great.

1441
01:08:40,143 --> 01:08:42,076
I've... l’ve never seen you there.

1442
01:08:42,144 --> 01:08:43,874
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

1443
01:08:43,947 --> 01:08:45,915
I go Saturday.

1444
01:08:45,983 --> 01:08:47,244
Congratulations.

1445
01:08:48,385 --> 01:08:50,410
Yeah. Hey, to both of us, right?

1446
01:08:50,487 --> 01:08:52,216
Have you heard about the
guy that invented this thing?

1447
01:08:52,289 --> 01:08:53,916
Well, uh, yeah, actually. I-

1448
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:56,186
I hear all kinds of things.

1449
01:08:56,259 --> 01:09:00,525
Supposedly... he was born
in a mental institution.

1450
01:09:00,597 --> 01:09:04,192
And he sleeps only one hour a night.

1451
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:05,598
He's a great man.

1452
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:06,601
Oh...

1453
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:08,934
do you know about Tyler Durden?

1454
01:09:17,981 --> 01:09:19,506
Ha ha ha!

1455
01:09:24,555 --> 01:09:29,224
Take him down!

1456
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,664
I didn't hurt you, did I?

1457
01:09:36,735 --> 01:09:39,330
Actually, you did.

1458
01:09:39,406 --> 01:09:40,998
Thank you for this.

1459
01:09:41,074 --> 01:09:43,202
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1460
01:09:43,277 --> 01:09:44,208
Fight Club.

1461
01:09:44,277 --> 01:09:46,177
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

1462
01:09:46,246 --> 01:09:47,839
This was mine and Tyler's gift...

1463
01:09:47,982 --> 01:09:50,108
our gift to the world.

1464
01:09:50,183 --> 01:09:52,015
Look around. Look around.

1465
01:09:52,086 --> 01:09:53,986
I see a lot of new faces.

1466
01:09:54,055 --> 01:09:54,987
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

1467
01:09:55,056 --> 01:09:56,044
Shut up!

1468
01:09:57,358 --> 01:09:59,190
Which means a lot of you

1469
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:02,161
have been breaking the
first 2 rules of Fight Club.

1470
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:11,701
Man, I see in Fight Club

1471
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:14,640
the strongest and smartest
men who've ever lived.

1472
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,201
I see all this potential.

1473
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:18,576
And I see squandering.

1474
01:10:19,948 --> 01:10:21,040
God damn it.

1475
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:24,052
An entire generation pumping gas...

1476
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,609
waiting tables...

1477
01:10:25,687 --> 01:10:27,621
slaves with white collars.

1478
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:33,519
Advertising has its taste
in cars and clothes...

1479
01:10:33,595 --> 01:10:36,826
working jobs we hate so we
can buy shit we don't need.

1480
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:43,230
We're the middle
children of history, man.

1481
01:10:43,306 --> 01:10:45,741
No purpose or place.

1482
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:49,244
We have no Great War...
no Great Depression.

1483
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:54,578
Our Great War's a spiritual war.

1484
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:57,882
Our Great Depression is our lives.

1485
01:11:01,827 --> 01:11:03,260
We've all been raised on television

1486
01:11:03,329 --> 01:11:05,262
to believe that one day
we'd all be millionaires

1487
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:07,799
and movie gods and rock stars.

1488
01:11:07,867 --> 01:11:09,596
But we won't.

1489
01:11:09,668 --> 01:11:11,568
We're slowly learning that fact.

1490
01:11:12,905 --> 01:11:15,533
And we're very, very pissed off.

1491
01:11:15,608 --> 01:11:16,540
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1492
01:11:20,547 --> 01:11:23,914
First rule of Fight Club
is you do not talk about-

1493
01:11:29,422 --> 01:11:30,650
Who are you?

1494
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:33,021
Who am I?

1495
01:11:33,093 --> 01:11:34,151
Yeah.

1496
01:11:35,662 --> 01:11:36,686
There's a sign in the front

1497
01:11:36,763 --> 01:11:37,822
that says "Lou's Tavern."

1498
01:11:38,965 --> 01:11:41,160
I'm fuckin' Lou.

1499
01:11:41,234 --> 01:11:42,861
Who the fuck are you?

1500
01:11:42,937 --> 01:11:44,927
Tyler Durden.

1501
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:50,936
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1502
01:11:51,011 --> 01:11:52,979
We have a deal worked out with Irvin.

1503
01:11:53,046 --> 01:11:54,071
Irvin?

1504
01:11:54,148 --> 01:11:56,672
Irvin's at home with
a broken collarbone.

1505
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,377
He don't own this place.

1506
01:11:58,451 --> 01:11:59,384
I do.

1507
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:03,480
How much money is he gettin' for this?

1508
01:12:03,558 --> 01:12:04,821
There is no money.

1509
01:12:04,893 --> 01:12:07,487
- Really. Ain't that somethin'?
- Free to all.

1510
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:09,428
It is, actually.

1511
01:12:09,498 --> 01:12:11,966
Look, stupid fuck...

1512
01:12:12,034 --> 01:12:13,523
I want everybody outta here right now.

1513
01:12:13,601 --> 01:12:16,833
Hey. You should join our club.

1514
01:12:18,173 --> 01:12:19,607
Did you hear what I just said?

1515
01:12:19,676 --> 01:12:21,440
You and your friend.

1516
01:12:21,512 --> 01:12:23,309
Oomph!

1517
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,438
Uhh!

1518
01:12:24,515 --> 01:12:26,415
You hear me now?!

1519
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:30,113
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1520
01:12:30,187 --> 01:12:31,245
Ooh!

1521
01:12:31,322 --> 01:12:32,254
Pfft!

1522
01:12:33,991 --> 01:12:34,923
Ohhh...

1523
01:12:36,493 --> 01:12:38,256
Still not gettin' it.

1524
01:12:39,463 --> 01:12:41,125
Aah! OK, OK, OK. I got it.

1525
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,633
I got it. I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1526
01:12:43,702 --> 01:12:45,294
Ooh!

1527
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:46,497
Back! All of you!

1528
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:49,631
Everybody back.

1529
01:12:51,878 --> 01:12:53,742
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1530
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,911
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1531
01:12:57,984 --> 01:13:00,008
Aw, Lou...

1532
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:02,076
Come on, man.

1533
01:13:02,153 --> 01:13:03,678
We really like this place.

1534
01:13:05,123 --> 01:13:06,556
Ohh!

1535
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:12,722
Ohhh...

1536
01:13:12,797 --> 01:13:15,790
- That's right, Lou, get
it- - Shut the fuck up!

1537
01:13:15,868 --> 01:13:17,630
Oh, yeah!

1538
01:13:17,702 --> 01:13:20,229
Yeah! Ha ha ha ha ha!

1539
01:13:20,307 --> 01:13:22,536
Ho ho ho ha ha ha!

1540
01:13:22,608 --> 01:13:23,871
Think that's fuckin' funny?!

1541
01:13:23,944 --> 01:13:25,912
Ho ho, ho! Ha ha ha ha!

1542
01:13:25,979 --> 01:13:28,971
Ha ha ha ha
- Ohh! Ho ho ho!

1543
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:35,485
Fuckin' guys are loony, I'm tellin' ya.

1544
01:13:37,724 --> 01:13:39,715
Unbelievable. Aah!

1545
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:44,827
You don't know where I've been, Lou.

1546
01:13:44,901 --> 01:13:46,595
- Oh, my God!
- Ha ha ha!

1547
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:49,536
You don't know where I've been! Ha ha!

1548
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:51,903
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1549
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:54,204
Lou! Please let us keep it, Lou!

1550
01:13:54,276 --> 01:13:55,744
Please, Lou!

1551
01:13:55,812 --> 01:13:58,279
Fuckin' use the basement! Christ!

1552
01:13:58,347 --> 01:14:01,250
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1553
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:03,252
On my mother's honor.

1554
01:14:04,988 --> 01:14:05,921
Uhh!

1555
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:09,454
Lou!

1556
01:14:09,526 --> 01:14:11,154
Aaahhh!

1557
01:14:12,463 --> 01:14:13,555
Thanks, Lou.

1558
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:17,561
You, too, big guy.

1559
01:14:21,939 --> 01:14:23,463
See you next week.

1560
01:14:39,724 --> 01:14:42,057
This week... each one of you...

1561
01:14:42,127 --> 01:14:44,220
has a homework assignment.

1562
01:14:44,296 --> 01:14:45,558
You're gonna go out.

1563
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:48,030
You're gonna start a fight
with a total stranger.

1564
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:52,994
You're gonna start a fight.

1565
01:14:54,139 --> 01:14:55,572
And you're gonna lose.

1566
01:14:58,643 --> 01:15:00,306
Excellent choice, sir.

1567
01:15:02,316 --> 01:15:04,011
Hey! Watch out, jackass!

1568
01:15:04,085 --> 01:15:05,177
Come on!

1569
01:15:05,253 --> 01:15:07,846
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.

1570
01:15:09,802 --> 01:15:11,632
I'm thinkin' you really-What?!

1571
01:15:11,703 --> 01:15:13,136
Son of a bitch!

1572
01:15:13,204 --> 01:15:16,106
Most people... normal people...

1573
01:15:16,175 --> 01:15:18,233
do just about anything to avoid a fight.

1574
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:22,077
Excuse me. You sprayed
me with your hose.

1575
01:15:22,148 --> 01:15:23,341
Like that?

1576
01:15:23,415 --> 01:15:24,780
That's not necessary.

1577
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:26,716
Dave! Go call 911!

1578
01:15:28,487 --> 01:15:29,419
Aaaahhh!

1579
01:15:31,424 --> 01:15:33,691
Stop it!

1580
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:37,261
Sorry.

1581
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:39,195
What did
- Come here!

1582
01:15:39,265 --> 01:15:41,426
Leave me alone! You crazy?

1583
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:42,468
Uhh!

1584
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:44,862
Unhh! Uhh!

1585
01:15:46,071 --> 01:15:47,004
Bastard!

1586
01:15:52,779 --> 01:15:54,246
We need to talk.

1587
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:57,882
OK.

1588
01:16:00,454 --> 01:16:01,716
Where to begin?

1589
01:16:01,789 --> 01:16:04,223
With your constant absenteeism?

1590
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:07,385
With your unpresentable appearance?

1591
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:08,826
You're up for review.

1592
01:16:08,896 --> 01:16:12,127
I am Jack’s... complete
lack of surprise.

1593
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:13,132
What?

1594
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:14,168
Let's pretend.

1595
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,066
You're the Department of Transportation.

1596
01:16:16,137 --> 01:16:17,104
OK?

1597
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:20,836
Someone informs you that this company

1598
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,901
installs front seat mounting brackets

1599
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:25,005
that never pass collision tests...

1600
01:16:25,082 --> 01:16:28,517
brake linings that fail
after a thousand miles,

1601
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,746
and fuel injectors that explode

1602
01:16:30,821 --> 01:16:32,583
and burn people alive.

1603
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:34,983
What then?

1604
01:16:35,058 --> 01:16:37,355
Are you threatening me?

1605
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,393
No...

1606
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:40,225
Get the fuck outta here. You're fired.

1607
01:16:40,297 --> 01:16:41,993
I have a better solution.

1608
01:16:42,066 --> 01:16:45,558
You keep me on the payroll
as an outside consultant.

1609
01:16:45,637 --> 01:16:47,366
And in exchange for my salary,

1610
01:16:47,438 --> 01:16:49,234
my job will be never to tell people

1611
01:16:49,306 --> 01:16:51,537
these things that I know.

1612
01:16:51,609 --> 01:16:53,600
I don't even have to
come into the office.

1613
01:16:53,678 --> 01:16:55,144
I can do this job from home.

1614
01:16:56,948 --> 01:16:58,882
Who-Who the fuck do you think you are,

1615
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:01,680
you crazy little shit?

1616
01:17:05,858 --> 01:17:07,324
Security?

1617
01:17:07,392 --> 01:17:09,383
I am Jack's smirking revenge.

1618
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:10,654
Ohh!

1619
01:17:15,466 --> 01:17:16,593
Ohh!

1620
01:17:16,669 --> 01:17:17,999
Ahh... ahh...

1621
01:17:18,069 --> 01:17:20,435
What the hell are you doing?

1622
01:17:28,682 --> 01:17:30,911
Ohh... that hurt.

1623
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,881
Why would you do that?

1624
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:37,217
Oh, my God.

1625
01:17:37,289 --> 01:17:38,951
No! Please stop!

1626
01:17:41,696 --> 01:17:44,097
Uhh! Uh... uhh!

1627
01:17:49,104 --> 01:17:50,366
What are you doing?

1628
01:17:51,506 --> 01:17:53,565
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1629
01:17:53,642 --> 01:17:56,304
For some reason, I
thought of my first fight

1630
01:17:56,378 --> 01:17:57,742
with Tyler.

1631
01:17:57,812 --> 01:17:58,745
No!

1632
01:18:23,873 --> 01:18:26,104
Under and behind and inside,

1633
01:18:26,176 --> 01:18:28,370
everything this man took for granted...

1634
01:18:28,444 --> 01:18:30,811
something horrible had been growing.

1635
01:18:32,015 --> 01:18:33,107
Now, look.

1636
01:18:33,182 --> 01:18:35,514
Give me the paychecks like I asked,

1637
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:37,917
and you won't ever see me again.

1638
01:18:37,987 --> 01:18:41,447
And right then, at our most
excellent moment together...

1639
01:18:43,794 --> 01:18:45,921
Oh... thank God.

1640
01:18:45,996 --> 01:18:47,862
Please don't hit me again. Please...

1641
01:18:47,933 --> 01:18:50,093
Telephone, computer, fax machine,

1642
01:18:50,167 --> 01:18:54,400
52 weekly paychecks, and
48 airline flight coupons.

1643
01:18:54,472 --> 01:18:56,871
We now had corporate sponsorship.

1644
01:18:56,942 --> 01:18:59,172
This is how Tyler and I
were able to have Fight Club

1645
01:18:59,244 --> 01:19:00,710
every night of the week.

1646
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:05,941
Now nobody was the center of Fight Club

1647
01:19:06,019 --> 01:19:08,010
except the 2 men fighting.

1648
01:19:08,088 --> 01:19:12,081
The leader walked through the
crowd, out in the darkness.

1649
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,227
Tyler was now involved
in a class-action lawsuit

1650
01:19:16,296 --> 01:19:18,821
with the Pressman Hotel over
the urine content of their soup.

1651
01:19:25,406 --> 01:19:27,670
I am Jack’s wasted life.

1652
01:19:32,246 --> 01:19:35,272
Yeah! Yeah! Ha ha! Yeah!

1653
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:36,747
There you are, sir.

1654
01:19:40,089 --> 01:19:42,682
Tyler dreamed up new
homework assignments.

1655
01:19:42,757 --> 01:19:45,386
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.

1656
01:20:24,536 --> 01:20:26,128
Did you know there's a Fight Club

1657
01:20:26,204 --> 01:20:27,136
up in Delaware City?

1658
01:20:27,205 --> 01:20:28,137
Yeah, I heard.

1659
01:20:29,307 --> 01:20:31,935
There's one in Penn's Grove, too.

1660
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:34,240
Bob even found one up in Newcastle.

1661
01:20:34,312 --> 01:20:36,246
Yeah. Did you start that one?

1662
01:20:36,314 --> 01:20:37,748
No. I thought you did.

1663
01:20:37,817 --> 01:20:39,078
Nah.

1664
01:20:39,151 --> 01:20:40,083
Pff!

1665
01:21:29,037 --> 01:21:30,401
Stop for a second.

1666
01:21:30,472 --> 01:21:31,905
Hey, what are we doing?

1667
01:21:31,973 --> 01:21:32,905
Turn around.

1668
01:21:32,974 --> 01:21:34,407
What are we doing?

1669
01:21:34,476 --> 01:21:35,408
Homework assignment.

1670
01:21:35,477 --> 01:21:36,739
What kind of homework assignment?

1671
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:38,073
Human sacrifice.

1672
01:21:38,146 --> 01:21:39,238
Hey, is that a gun?

1673
01:21:39,314 --> 01:21:40,747
Please. Please tell me that's not a gun.

1674
01:21:40,815 --> 01:21:41,749
It's a gun.

1675
01:21:41,818 --> 01:21:42,750
What are you doing?

1676
01:21:42,819 --> 01:21:43,751
Meet me in the back.

1677
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:45,253
Hey, don't fuck around.

1678
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:46,551
Meet me in the back.

1679
01:21:46,624 --> 01:21:48,750
On a long enough time line,

1680
01:21:48,825 --> 01:21:51,191
the survival rate for
everyone drops to zero.

1681
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:54,297
What are you doing? Come on.

1682
01:21:54,364 --> 01:21:55,729
Hands behind your back.

1683
01:21:55,799 --> 01:21:56,731
God.

1684
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,893
Give me your wallet.

1685
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:00,500
Raymond K. Hessel,

1686
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:03,564
1320 Southeast Banning, apartment A.

1687
01:22:03,642 --> 01:22:04,972
Small, cramped basement
apartment, Raymond?

1688
01:22:05,042 --> 01:22:06,066
How did you know?

1689
01:22:06,144 --> 01:22:07,772
Because they give shitty
basement apartments

1690
01:22:07,846 --> 01:22:09,780
Letters instead of numbers.

1691
01:22:09,848 --> 01:22:11,280
Raymond...

1692
01:22:11,349 --> 01:22:12,783
you're going to die.

1693
01:22:12,851 --> 01:22:14,318
Oh, my God, no...

1694
01:22:14,386 --> 01:22:15,580
Is that your mom and dad?

1695
01:22:15,654 --> 01:22:17,143
Mom and dad are going to have to call up

1696
01:22:17,221 --> 01:22:18,211
kindly Dr.
So-And-So

1697
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:19,689
to pick up your dental records.

1698
01:22:19,758 --> 01:22:20,952
You want to know why?

1699
01:22:21,026 --> 01:22:22,754
Because there's going to be
nothing left of your face.

1700
01:22:22,827 --> 01:22:24,591
Aw, come on.

1701
01:22:24,663 --> 01:22:27,097
An expired community
college student I.D.

1702
01:22:27,166 --> 01:22:28,598
What'd you study, Raymond?

1703
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:30,225
S- S-S-Stuff.

1704
01:22:30,302 --> 01:22:31,701
Stuff?

1705
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:33,896
Were the midterms hard?

1706
01:22:35,007 --> 01:22:36,372
I asked you what you studied.

1707
01:22:36,441 --> 01:22:37,567
Biology, mostly.

1708
01:22:37,643 --> 01:22:38,768
Why?

1709
01:22:38,843 --> 01:22:40,744
I- I don't know.

1710
01:22:40,812 --> 01:22:44,214
What did you want to
be, Raymond K. Hessel?

1711
01:22:45,685 --> 01:22:47,812
The question, Raymond,

1712
01:22:47,887 --> 01:22:51,277
was what did you want to be?

1713
01:22:51,411 --> 01:22:53,242
Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!

1714
01:22:53,313 --> 01:22:54,712
Veterinarian! Veterinarian!

1715
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:55,840
Animals.

1716
01:22:55,916 --> 01:22:57,849
Yeah,
animal s-s-s-

1717
01:22:57,917 --> 01:22:58,941
Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1718
01:22:59,018 --> 01:23:00,076
That means you have
to get more schooling.

1719
01:23:00,153 --> 01:23:01,587
Too much school.

1720
01:23:01,655 --> 01:23:03,021
Would you rather be dead?

1721
01:23:03,091 --> 01:23:04,023
No...

1722
01:23:04,092 --> 01:23:05,320
Would you rather die, here,

1723
01:23:05,393 --> 01:23:06,827
on your knees,

1724
01:23:06,896 --> 01:23:08,692
in the back of a convenience store?

1725
01:23:08,763 --> 01:23:10,321
No... No, please...

1726
01:23:10,398 --> 01:23:11,661
no...

1727
01:23:14,936 --> 01:23:16,495
I'm keeping your license.

1728
01:23:17,773 --> 01:23:19,330
Gonna check in on you.

1729
01:23:19,407 --> 01:23:21,341
I know where you live.

1730
01:23:21,409 --> 01:23:24,346
If you’re not on your way
to becoming a veterinarian

1731
01:23:24,414 --> 01:23:26,040
in 6 weeks, you will be dead.

1732
01:23:27,918 --> 01:23:29,749
Now run on home.

1733
01:23:34,524 --> 01:23:36,821
Run, Forrest, run!

1734
01:23:38,462 --> 01:23:39,827
I feel ill.

1735
01:23:41,965 --> 01:23:43,398
Imagine how he feels.

1736
01:23:43,466 --> 01:23:45,400
Come on, this isn't funny!

1737
01:23:45,468 --> 01:23:46,901
That wasn't funny.

1738
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:48,995
What the fuck was the point of that?

1739
01:23:49,072 --> 01:23:50,505
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day

1740
01:23:50,573 --> 01:23:52,006
of Raymond K. Hessel's life.

1741
01:23:52,075 --> 01:23:53,508
His breakfast will taste better

1742
01:23:53,576 --> 01:23:56,477
than any meal you and
I have ever tasted.

1743
01:23:58,014 --> 01:24:00,608
You had to give it to him.

1744
01:24:00,684 --> 01:24:02,015
Come on.

1745
01:24:02,085 --> 01:24:03,053
He had a plan.

1746
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,055
And it started to make sense

1747
01:24:05,122 --> 01:24:06,487
in a Tyler sort of way.

1748
01:24:06,557 --> 01:24:07,546
No fear.

1749
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,560
No distractions.

1750
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:12,994
The ability to let that
which does not matter

1751
01:24:13,064 --> 01:24:15,033
truly slide.

1752
01:24:27,181 --> 01:24:28,807
You're not your job.

1753
01:24:31,051 --> 01:24:34,315
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1754
01:24:36,056 --> 01:24:38,820
You're not the car you drive.

1755
01:24:38,892 --> 01:24:41,486
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1756
01:24:42,964 --> 01:24:44,989
You're not your fuckin' khakis.

1757
01:24:47,202 --> 01:24:50,638
You're the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1758
01:24:59,681 --> 01:25:02,616
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1759
01:25:02,684 --> 01:25:04,151
You don't have to go.

1760
01:25:06,254 --> 01:25:07,346
Whatever.

1761
01:25:08,423 --> 01:25:11,358
No, I mean, uh...

1762
01:25:11,426 --> 01:25:12,654
It's OK.

1763
01:25:22,103 --> 01:25:24,972
Are you still going to groups?

1764
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:26,132
Yeah.

1765
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:30,142
Chloe's dead.

1766
01:25:30,213 --> 01:25:32,908
Ah, Chloe.

1767
01:25:32,982 --> 01:25:35,144
When did that happen?

1768
01:25:35,218 --> 01:25:37,617
Do you care?

1769
01:25:37,686 --> 01:25:38,983
I don't know.

1770
01:25:39,054 --> 01:25:41,250
I haven't thought about it in a while.

1771
01:25:41,324 --> 01:25:43,589
Yeah, well...

1772
01:25:43,661 --> 01:25:46,790
I think it was a smart move on her part.

1773
01:25:47,933 --> 01:25:49,263
Hey, listen, uh...

1774
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:52,997
what are you getting out of all this?

1775
01:25:53,071 --> 01:25:54,230
What?

1776
01:25:55,474 --> 01:25:56,907
I mean, all this.

1777
01:25:56,975 --> 01:25:58,408
Why do you keep...

1778
01:25:58,477 --> 01:26:00,945
Is this making you happy?

1779
01:26:02,614 --> 01:26:04,640
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1780
01:26:06,085 --> 01:26:08,519
I don't know. I don't understand.

1781
01:26:08,588 --> 01:26:10,522
Why does a weaker person

1782
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:13,024
need to latch on to a strong person?

1783
01:26:13,092 --> 01:26:14,354
What is that?

1784
01:26:14,427 --> 01:26:16,555
Well, what do you get out of it?

1785
01:26:18,498 --> 01:26:20,432
No-It's-It's not the
same thing at all.

1786
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,366
I mean, we're... it's
totally different with us.

1787
01:26:22,436 --> 01:26:23,527
We're-We're-

1788
01:26:23,603 --> 01:26:24,661
Us?

1789
01:26:24,737 --> 01:26:26,534
What do you mean by "us"?

1790
01:26:26,606 --> 01:26:28,336
I'm sorry, do you hear this?

1791
01:26:28,409 --> 01:26:29,432
Hear what?

1792
01:26:29,509 --> 01:26:31,477
You're not hearing all that noise?

1793
01:26:31,544 --> 01:26:32,477
Just-Hold on a second.

1794
01:26:32,546 --> 01:26:33,706
No, wait. What were you saying?

1795
01:26:33,781 --> 01:26:35,441
Don't change the subject.
I want to talk about this.

1796
01:26:35,515 --> 01:26:37,210
You're not talking about me, are you?

1797
01:26:37,283 --> 01:26:39,115
No. What?

1798
01:26:39,186 --> 01:26:40,982
That day you came over to
my place to play doctor-

1799
01:26:41,054 --> 01:26:42,646
what was going on there?

1800
01:26:42,722 --> 01:26:43,691
What are you talking about?

1801
01:26:43,758 --> 01:26:45,191
Nothing. Nothing.

1802
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:46,317
I don't think so.

1803
01:26:46,393 --> 01:26:47,655
Come on, what do you want?

1804
01:26:47,728 --> 01:26:48,991
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1805
01:26:49,064 --> 01:26:50,827
Look at me.

1806
01:26:50,899 --> 01:26:52,331
What is that?

1807
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:53,992
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

1808
01:26:54,069 --> 01:26:55,001
Oh, my God.

1809
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,094
Who did this?

1810
01:26:56,171 --> 01:26:57,103
A person.

1811
01:26:57,172 --> 01:26:58,160
Guy or girl?

1812
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,231
What do you care if
it’s a guy or a girl?

1813
01:27:00,308 --> 01:27:01,366
What do you care if I ask?

1814
01:27:01,443 --> 01:27:02,603
This is none of your
business. Leave me alone.

1815
01:27:02,677 --> 01:27:03,610
You're afraid to say it.

1816
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:04,612
I am not afraid to say. Let me go.

1817
01:27:04,681 --> 01:27:05,739
No! Talk to me.

1818
01:27:05,816 --> 01:27:07,010
- No!
- Let go of me. Leave me alone.

1819
01:27:07,084 --> 01:27:09,778
This conversation...

1820
01:27:09,853 --> 01:27:11,650
is over.

1821
01:27:11,722 --> 01:27:13,155
Is over.

1822
01:27:14,324 --> 01:27:16,690
I just can't win with you, can I?

1823
01:27:24,502 --> 01:27:27,437
Hey, this is getting a little old.

1824
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,236
What is-What is all this?

1825
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:32,742
What do you think?

1826
01:27:34,178 --> 01:27:37,239
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1827
01:27:37,316 --> 01:27:38,247
Hey.

1828
01:27:45,356 --> 01:27:46,915
Too young.

1829
01:27:46,992 --> 01:27:48,550
Sorry.

1830
01:27:48,627 --> 01:27:50,856
What's all that?

1831
01:27:50,929 --> 01:27:53,455
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1832
01:27:53,532 --> 01:27:54,998
Old, too old. Fat, too fat.

1833
01:27:55,066 --> 01:27:56,033
Applicant?

1834
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,966
If the applicant then waits for 3 days

1835
01:27:58,037 --> 01:27:59,971
without food, shelter or encouragement,

1836
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:02,473
he may then enter and
begin his training.

1837
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:04,100
Training for what?

1838
01:28:09,249 --> 01:28:11,183
You think this is a game?

1839
01:28:11,251 --> 01:28:13,185
You're too young to train here.

1840
01:28:13,253 --> 01:28:15,187
End of story. Quit wasting our time.

1841
01:28:15,255 --> 01:28:16,688
Get the fuck out of here.

1842
01:28:21,294 --> 01:28:22,693
Bad news, friend.

1843
01:28:23,865 --> 01:28:25,799
It's not gonna happen.

1844
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:28,802
I'm sorry if there
was a misunderstanding.

1845
01:28:28,871 --> 01:28:30,838
It's not the end of the world.

1846
01:28:30,906 --> 01:28:32,339
Just go away.

1847
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:35,306
Go.

1848
01:28:35,377 --> 01:28:36,969
You're trespassing,

1849
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:38,979
and I will have to call the police.

1850
01:28:42,451 --> 01:28:44,249
Don't you look at me.

1851
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,084
Do you think you're ever
getting in this house?

1852
01:28:46,156 --> 01:28:47,588
You're never getting
in this fucking house.

1853
01:28:47,657 --> 01:28:49,488
Never. Now get the fuck off the porch.

1854
01:28:49,559 --> 01:28:51,027
Get off the porch!

1855
01:28:51,095 --> 01:28:52,527
Sooner or later,

1856
01:28:52,595 --> 01:28:54,654
we all became what
Tyler wanted us to be.

1857
01:28:54,731 --> 01:28:57,530
I'm gonna go inside and
I'm gonna get a shovel.

1858
01:29:04,574 --> 01:29:06,008
You got 2 black shirts?

1859
01:29:06,076 --> 01:29:07,008
Sir.

1860
01:29:07,077 --> 01:29:08,510
2 pair of black pants?

1861
01:29:08,579 --> 01:29:09,510
Yes, sir.

1862
01:29:09,579 --> 01:29:10,511
One pair of black boots?

1863
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:11,513
Sir.

1864
01:29:11,582 --> 01:29:12,514
2 pair of black socks?

1865
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:13,515
Sir.

1866
01:29:13,584 --> 01:29:14,516
One black jacket?

1867
01:29:14,585 --> 01:29:15,516
Sir.

1868
01:29:15,585 --> 01:29:16,712
$300 personal burial money?

1869
01:29:16,787 --> 01:29:17,845
Yes, sir.

1870
01:29:19,690 --> 01:29:21,316
All right.

1871
01:29:31,536 --> 01:29:34,699
You're too old, fat man.

1872
01:29:34,773 --> 01:29:36,331
Your tits are too big.

1873
01:29:36,408 --> 01:29:38,842
Get the fuck off my porch.

1874
01:29:45,352 --> 01:29:47,843
Bob. Bob.

1875
01:30:03,003 --> 01:30:04,438
Like a monkey

1876
01:30:04,506 --> 01:30:06,565
ready to be shot into space.

1877
01:30:06,641 --> 01:30:08,165
Space monkey.

1878
01:30:08,242 --> 01:30:12,440
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1879
01:30:17,352 --> 01:30:21,288
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1880
01:30:21,356 --> 01:30:23,017
And you.

1881
01:30:23,092 --> 01:30:24,683
You're too fucking...

1882
01:30:24,759 --> 01:30:26,057
blond!

1883
01:30:26,128 --> 01:30:28,520
Get out of here, the both of you!

1884
01:30:29,488 --> 01:30:30,921
And so it went.

1885
01:30:30,989 --> 01:30:32,923
Listen up, maggots.

1886
01:30:32,991 --> 01:30:35,458
You are not special.

1887
01:30:35,526 --> 01:30:38,894
You are not a beautiful
or unique snowflake.

1888
01:30:38,964 --> 01:30:41,398
You are the same decaying organic matter

1889
01:30:41,466 --> 01:30:43,093
as everything else.

1890
01:30:43,168 --> 01:30:45,501
Tyler built himself an army.

1891
01:30:45,572 --> 01:30:49,508
We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1892
01:30:49,576 --> 01:30:53,205
We are all part of
the same compost heap.

1893
01:30:54,881 --> 01:30:58,282
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?

1894
01:30:58,351 --> 01:31:00,012
To what purpose?

1895
01:31:00,086 --> 01:31:01,849
For what greater good?

1896
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,090
In Tyler we trusted.

1897
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:16,734
No, when he was like, "You are
not your job," I was like...

1898
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:18,273
Yeah!

1899
01:31:20,009 --> 01:31:21,669
Hey, what's all this?

1900
01:31:24,615 --> 01:31:26,378
OK!

1901
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:28,474
Go on in and celebrate.

1902
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:29,985
What are we celebrating?

1903
01:31:30,053 --> 01:31:31,020
Go on.

1904
01:31:35,559 --> 01:31:36,491
Hey.

1905
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:37,993
Let me get that for you.

1906
01:31:49,206 --> 01:31:51,640
Investigators are on
the scene right now.

1907
01:31:51,708 --> 01:31:54,006
Hold on. Police Commissioner
Jacobs has just arrived.

1908
01:31:54,077 --> 01:31:57,069
Commissioner, Commissioner,
could you please tell us

1909
01:31:57,147 --> 01:31:58,774
what you think has happened here?

1910
01:31:58,849 --> 01:32:00,282
We believe this is one of many

1911
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:02,511
recent acts of vandalism around the city

1912
01:32:02,586 --> 01:32:05,556
somehow related to
underground boxing clubs.

1913
01:32:05,623 --> 01:32:09,753
We'll be coordinating a
rigorous investigation.

1914
01:32:09,827 --> 01:32:12,262
That was Police Commissioner
Jacobs, who just arrived

1915
01:32:12,331 --> 01:32:14,195
on the scene here of a 4-alarm fire

1916
01:32:14,265 --> 01:32:15,926
that broke out about an hour ago.

1917
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,990
She's hot.

1918
01:32:17,069 --> 01:32:18,536
Live from the Parker Morris Building,

1919
01:32:18,603 --> 01:32:20,468
Lauren Sanchez. Back
to you in the studio.

1920
01:32:20,538 --> 01:32:22,166
Yeah!

1921
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:23,799
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Yeah.

1922
01:32:23,876 --> 01:32:25,469
Holy shit.

1923
01:32:25,545 --> 01:32:26,477
Yeah!

1924
01:32:30,183 --> 01:32:31,309
- Yeah!
- Ha ha ha!

1925
01:32:31,384 --> 01:32:32,647
Hoo hoo hoo!

1926
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,312
What the fuck did you guys do?

1927
01:32:34,388 --> 01:32:35,753
...how the blaze started,

1928
01:32:35,822 --> 01:32:38,519
but arson investigators
are on the premises...

1929
01:32:43,698 --> 01:32:46,634
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem

1930
01:32:46,702 --> 01:32:49,102
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1931
01:32:54,476 --> 01:32:57,001
The victory in the war against crime

1932
01:32:57,079 --> 01:32:59,104
will not come overnight.

1933
01:32:59,181 --> 01:33:01,308
It will take dedication and commitment,

1934
01:33:01,383 --> 01:33:03,817
and most of all, cooperation.

1935
01:33:03,885 --> 01:33:05,409
The streets are safer now.

1936
01:33:05,487 --> 01:33:07,751
There is hope in the inner city.

1937
01:33:07,823 --> 01:33:09,849
However, this is only the beginning.

1938
01:33:09,926 --> 01:33:10,892
I gotta take a piss.

1939
01:33:10,959 --> 01:33:13,393
These are the first steps

1940
01:33:13,462 --> 01:33:15,021
in a long journey.

1941
01:33:15,098 --> 01:33:17,395
That is why we have
created Project Hope...

1942
01:33:17,466 --> 01:33:18,592
Bob.

1943
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:21,603
"Helping others with
prevention and enforcement."

1944
01:33:21,671 --> 01:33:24,434
Project Hope will be a joint effort

1945
01:33:24,507 --> 01:33:27,204
between the police
and community leaders.

1946
01:33:27,277 --> 01:33:29,904
It will be a powerful new weapon

1947
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:31,777
in the war against crime.

1948
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:09,347
Haahhhh!

1949
01:34:16,997 --> 01:34:19,659
Wrap it around the top
of his hacky sack, Bob.

1950
01:34:19,733 --> 01:34:21,132
Yeah. His bails are ice cold.

1951
01:34:22,502 --> 01:34:23,936
Hi.

1952
01:34:24,005 --> 01:34:26,495
You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1953
01:34:26,573 --> 01:34:27,597
You're gonna publicly state

1954
01:34:27,674 --> 01:34:30,473
that there is no
underground group, or...

1955
01:34:30,545 --> 01:34:32,307
these guys are gonna take your bails.

1956
01:34:32,379 --> 01:34:34,507
They're gonna send one
to the New York Times,

1957
01:34:34,582 --> 01:34:37,516
one to the L.A. Times
press release style.

1958
01:34:37,584 --> 01:34:38,846
Look...

1959
01:34:38,919 --> 01:34:40,353
the people you are after

1960
01:34:40,421 --> 01:34:42,354
are the people you depend on.

1961
01:34:42,422 --> 01:34:44,481
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.

1962
01:34:44,558 --> 01:34:45,686
We connect your calls.

1963
01:34:45,761 --> 01:34:47,285
We drive your ambulances.

1964
01:34:47,362 --> 01:34:50,729
We guard you while you sleep.

1965
01:34:53,734 --> 01:34:56,602
Do not fuck with us.

1966
01:35:05,281 --> 01:35:06,249
Fooled ya.

1967
01:35:21,867 --> 01:35:23,731
Bob, you're on this one.

1968
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:26,168
Let's go.

1969
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:30,436
I am Jack’s inflamed sense of rejection.

1970
01:35:30,508 --> 01:35:31,440
Hey!

1971
01:35:47,092 --> 01:35:48,355
Yeah!

1972
01:36:21,128 --> 01:36:23,926
I felt like putting a
bullet between the eyes

1973
01:36:23,997 --> 01:36:26,661
of every panda that wouldn't
screw to save its species.

1974
01:36:29,104 --> 01:36:31,572
I wanted to open the dump valves

1975
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,040
on oil tankers and smother
all those French beaches

1976
01:36:34,109 --> 01:36:35,701
I'd never see.

1977
01:36:39,014 --> 01:36:42,382
I wanted to breathe smoke.

1978
01:36:58,602 --> 01:37:02,299
Where'd you go, psycho boy?

1979
01:37:02,373 --> 01:37:05,365
I felt like destroying
something beautiful.

1980
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:11,443
Get him to a fuckin' hospital.

1981
01:37:11,514 --> 01:37:12,446
Yeah.

1982
01:37:23,694 --> 01:37:25,424
Don't worry, Mr. Durden.

1983
01:37:25,497 --> 01:37:27,226
Airport parking, long term.

1984
01:37:28,367 --> 01:37:30,198
After you, Mr. Durden.

1985
01:37:31,536 --> 01:37:33,265
After you.

1986
01:37:51,692 --> 01:37:53,125
Something on your mind, dear?

1987
01:37:53,193 --> 01:37:54,285
No.

1988
01:37:54,361 --> 01:37:55,488
All right, yeah.

1989
01:37:55,563 --> 01:37:57,621
Why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem?

1990
01:37:57,698 --> 01:37:58,960
First rule of Project Mayhem

1991
01:37:59,033 --> 01:38:00,795
is you do not ask questions.

1992
01:38:00,929 --> 01:38:01,827
What are you talking about?

1993
01:38:01,896 --> 01:38:03,123
Why didn't you include
me in the beginning?

1994
01:38:03,197 --> 01:38:04,721
Fight Club was the beginning.

1995
01:38:04,798 --> 01:38:06,427
Now it's moved out of the basement,

1996
01:38:06,502 --> 01:38:07,935
it's called Project Mayhem.

1997
01:38:08,003 --> 01:38:09,469
You and I started Fight Club together.

1998
01:38:09,537 --> 01:38:10,834
Do you remember that?

1999
01:38:10,905 --> 01:38:12,874
It's as much mine as
it is yours, you know.

2000
01:38:12,942 --> 01:38:14,170
Is this about you and me?

2001
01:38:14,243 --> 01:38:15,971
Yeah. I thought we were
doing this together.

2002
01:38:16,044 --> 01:38:17,205
You're missing the point.

2003
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:19,406
This does not belong to us.

2004
01:38:19,481 --> 01:38:20,708
We are not special.

2005
01:38:20,782 --> 01:38:22,011
Fuck that. You should've told me.

2006
01:38:24,086 --> 01:38:25,212
Hey, Tyler!

2007
01:38:27,923 --> 01:38:29,720
Goddamn it, Tyler!

2008
01:38:29,792 --> 01:38:31,453
What do you want?! Statement of purpose?

2009
01:38:31,527 --> 01:38:32,551
Should I e-mail you?

2010
01:38:32,628 --> 01:38:34,152
Should I put this on
your action item list?

2011
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:35,720
You decide your own
level of involvement!

2012
01:38:35,798 --> 01:38:38,494
I will! I want to know
certain things first.

2013
01:38:38,567 --> 01:38:40,194
The first rule of Project Mayhem-

2014
01:38:40,269 --> 01:38:41,201
Shut up!

2015
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:43,397
I want to know what you're thinking.

2016
01:38:43,472 --> 01:38:44,439
Fuck what you know.

2017
01:38:44,506 --> 01:38:45,735
You need to forget about what you know.

2018
01:38:45,809 --> 01:38:46,741
That's your problem.

2019
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:48,072
Forget about what you think you know

2020
01:38:48,145 --> 01:38:49,941
about life, about friendship,

2021
01:38:50,013 --> 01:38:52,379
and especially about you and me.

2022
01:38:52,449 --> 01:38:53,417
What?

2023
01:38:53,484 --> 01:38:55,747
What is that supposed to mean? What...

2024
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:00,022
What are you doing?

2025
01:39:02,225 --> 01:39:04,922
Guys, what do you wish
you'd done before you die?

2026
01:39:04,996 --> 01:39:06,021
Paint a self-portrait.

2027
01:39:06,098 --> 01:39:07,030
Build a house.

2028
01:39:07,099 --> 01:39:08,566
And you?

2029
01:39:08,634 --> 01:39:11,195
I don't know. Get in the right lane.

2030
01:39:11,271 --> 01:39:12,862
I have to know the
answer to this question.

2031
01:39:12,938 --> 01:39:13,996
If you were to die right now,

2032
01:39:14,072 --> 01:39:16,007
how would you feel about your life?

2033
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:17,099
I don't know!

2034
01:39:17,176 --> 01:39:18,369
I wouldn't feel anything
good about my life.

2035
01:39:18,443 --> 01:39:19,740
Is that what you want
to hear me say? Fine.

2036
01:39:19,811 --> 01:39:21,404
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

2037
01:39:21,481 --> 01:39:23,277
Stop fucking around!

2038
01:39:23,348 --> 01:39:24,610
Tyler!

2039
01:39:26,787 --> 01:39:28,846
Jesus Christ!

2040
01:39:28,923 --> 01:39:30,048
Goddamn it!

2041
01:39:30,123 --> 01:39:31,682
Goddamn it! Fuck you!

2042
01:39:31,759 --> 01:39:33,124
Fuck Fight Club.

2043
01:39:33,193 --> 01:39:35,855
Fuck Marla. I'm sick of all your shit.

2044
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:39,626
OK.

2045
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,258
Quit screwing around. Take the wheel.

2046
01:39:41,335 --> 01:39:42,267
Look at you.

2047
01:39:42,336 --> 01:39:43,268
Take the wheel!

2048
01:39:43,337 --> 01:39:45,100
Look at you! You're fuckin' pathetic!

2049
01:39:45,172 --> 01:39:46,730
Why? Why? What are you talking about?

2050
01:39:46,807 --> 01:39:50,265
Why do you think I blew up your condo?

2051
01:39:51,378 --> 01:39:52,470
What?

2052
01:39:52,546 --> 01:39:54,571
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.

2053
01:39:54,648 --> 01:39:56,479
It's not a goddamn seminar.

2054
01:39:56,550 --> 01:39:58,484
Stop trying to control everything

2055
01:39:58,552 --> 01:40:00,144
and just let go.

2056
01:40:01,989 --> 01:40:03,889
Let go!

2057
01:40:03,958 --> 01:40:05,687
All right. Fine.

2058
01:40:06,895 --> 01:40:08,796
Fine.

2059
01:41:06,692 --> 01:41:10,025
I'd never been in a car accident.

2060
01:41:10,095 --> 01:41:13,030
This must have been what
all those people felt like

2061
01:41:13,098 --> 01:41:17,035
before I filed them as
statistics in my reports.

2062
01:41:17,103 --> 01:41:18,399
Goddamn.

2063
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:19,903
Huh?

2064
01:41:19,972 --> 01:41:21,964
Ha ha ha ha ha hahh!

2065
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:24,737
We just had a near-life experience.

2066
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:32,485
In the world I see,

2067
01:41:32,553 --> 01:41:35,316
you're stalking elk through
the damp canyon forest,

2068
01:41:35,388 --> 01:41:37,914
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

2069
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:41,991
You'll wear leather clothes

2070
01:41:42,062 --> 01:41:44,998
that will last you
the rest of your life.

2071
01:41:45,066 --> 01:41:48,504
You'll climb the vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

2072
01:41:49,972 --> 01:41:51,906
And when you look down,

2073
01:41:51,974 --> 01:41:54,909
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

2074
01:41:54,977 --> 01:41:58,412
Laying strips of venison
on the empty carpool lane

2075
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,415
of some abandoned superhighway.

2076
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:14,798
Feel better, champ.

2077
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:34,975
And then...

2078
01:42:35,052 --> 01:42:36,486
Tyler?

2079
01:42:36,554 --> 01:42:38,078
Tyler was gone.

2080
01:42:45,896 --> 01:42:48,128
Was I asleep?

2081
01:42:49,801 --> 01:42:51,098
Had I slept?

2082
01:42:51,169 --> 01:42:52,603
You are not a beautiful

2083
01:42:52,671 --> 01:42:54,104
unique snowflake, do you understand me?

2084
01:42:54,173 --> 01:42:57,108
The house had become a living thing,

2085
01:42:57,176 --> 01:42:59,610
wet inside from so many people

2086
01:42:59,678 --> 01:43:01,009
sweating and breathing.

2087
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,014
We are all from the same compost.

2088
01:43:03,082 --> 01:43:05,277
So many people moving, the house moved.

2089
01:43:07,588 --> 01:43:09,021
Planet Tyler.

2090
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:11,024
I had to hug the walls.

2091
01:43:11,092 --> 01:43:14,653
Trapped inside this clock
work of space monkeys.

2092
01:43:14,729 --> 01:43:16,162
You can't be smoking in here.

2093
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:18,960
Do you know how much ether
we have in this fucking house?

2094
01:43:19,033 --> 01:43:21,365
Cooking, working, and sleeping in teams.

2095
01:43:23,939 --> 01:43:25,667
Hang on a second.

2096
01:43:44,594 --> 01:43:47,255
It's under control, sir.

2097
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:51,631
Where is Tyler?

2098
01:43:51,701 --> 01:43:54,692
Sir, the first rule of
Project Mayhem is you do not-

2099
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,705
Right, uh... OK.

2100
01:43:59,141 --> 01:44:01,508
I'm all alone.

2101
01:44:01,578 --> 01:44:03,512
My father dumped me.

2102
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:05,012
Tyler dumped me.

2103
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:08,279
I am Jack’s broken heart.

2104
01:44:11,555 --> 01:44:14,490
What comes next in Project Mayhem,

2105
01:44:14,558 --> 01:44:16,024
only Tyler knows.

2106
01:44:16,092 --> 01:44:19,551
The second rule is you
do not ask questions.

2107
01:44:22,032 --> 01:44:23,465
Get the fuck away from me.

2108
01:44:23,534 --> 01:44:25,024
Get the fuck away from me!

2109
01:44:25,102 --> 01:44:27,504
Who are all these people?

2110
01:44:32,779 --> 01:44:34,905
Paper Street Soap Company.

2111
01:44:37,149 --> 01:44:39,208
Can I come in?

2112
01:44:42,255 --> 01:44:43,917
He's not here.

2113
01:44:43,991 --> 01:44:46,151
What?

2114
01:44:47,427 --> 01:44:50,828
Tyler isn't here.

2115
01:44:50,897 --> 01:44:53,366
Tyler went away.

2116
01:44:53,434 --> 01:44:54,731
Tyler's gone.

2117
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,492
Lay him down!

2118
01:45:26,567 --> 01:45:27,899
Gunshot wounds comin' through!

2119
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:30,352
Clear some fucking room!

2120
01:45:30,485 --> 01:45:32,749
What happened?! What happened?!

2121
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,378
We were on assignment.
We were supposed to kill

2122
01:45:34,455 --> 01:45:36,923
2 birds with one stone.

2123
01:45:36,991 --> 01:45:39,084
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

2124
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:41,721
Operation Latte Thunder, go.

2125
01:45:43,631 --> 01:45:45,496
And trash a franchise coffee bar.

2126
01:45:51,976 --> 01:45:53,273
We had it all worked out, sir.

2127
01:46:02,486 --> 01:46:03,475
It went smooth until...

2128
01:46:03,554 --> 01:46:05,783
Police! Freeze!

2129
01:46:05,855 --> 01:46:07,449
Until what?

2130
01:46:07,526 --> 01:46:08,550
They shot Bob.

2131
01:46:10,128 --> 01:46:11,424
They shot him in the head.

2132
01:46:11,495 --> 01:46:12,484
Those fuckin' pigs!

2133
01:46:16,001 --> 01:46:16,932
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

2134
01:46:17,001 --> 01:46:18,993
- Oh, God.
- Son of a-

2135
01:46:20,071 --> 01:46:22,163
Those motherfuckers!

2136
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:24,003
You morons.

2137
01:46:24,075 --> 01:46:26,339
You're running around in ski masks,

2138
01:46:26,411 --> 01:46:27,537
trying to blow things up.

2139
01:46:27,612 --> 01:46:28,874
What did you think was gonna happen?!

2140
01:46:32,951 --> 01:46:33,918
OK, quick,

2141
01:46:33,985 --> 01:46:35,350
we gotta get rid of the evidence.

2142
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:36,352
We gotta get rid of this body!

2143
01:46:36,421 --> 01:46:37,410
Bury him.

2144
01:46:37,489 --> 01:46:38,922
What?

2145
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:39,922
Take him to the garden

2146
01:46:39,991 --> 01:46:41,117
and bury him.

2147
01:46:42,227 --> 01:46:43,159
Come on, people!

2148
01:46:43,228 --> 01:46:44,160
Let's go!

2149
01:46:44,229 --> 01:46:45,389
Hey, get the fuck off!

2150
01:46:45,464 --> 01:46:46,396
Get away from him!

2151
01:46:46,465 --> 01:46:48,024
What are you talking about?

2152
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:49,431
This isn't a fucking piece of evidence,

2153
01:46:49,502 --> 01:46:50,765
this is a person!

2154
01:46:50,837 --> 01:46:51,769
He's a friend of mine,

2155
01:46:51,838 --> 01:46:52,930
and you're not gonna bury him

2156
01:46:53,005 --> 01:46:53,994
in the fucking garden.

2157
01:46:54,073 --> 01:46:57,065
He was killed serving
Project Mayhem, sir.

2158
01:46:57,143 --> 01:46:58,269
This is Bob.

2159
01:46:58,344 --> 01:47:00,779
But sir, in-in Project Mayhem

2160
01:47:00,848 --> 01:47:02,405
we have no names.

2161
01:47:02,482 --> 01:47:03,449
No, you listen to me.

2162
01:47:03,516 --> 01:47:05,381
This is a man, and he has a name.

2163
01:47:05,451 --> 01:47:08,081
And it's Robert Paulson, OK?

2164
01:47:08,156 --> 01:47:09,521
Robert Paulson?

2165
01:47:09,591 --> 01:47:11,184
He's a man and he's dead now

2166
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:12,284
because of us, all right?

2167
01:47:12,361 --> 01:47:13,555
Do you understand that?

2168
01:47:13,629 --> 01:47:15,858
I understand.

2169
01:47:18,434 --> 01:47:19,730
In death,

2170
01:47:19,801 --> 01:47:21,565
a member of Project Mayhem

2171
01:47:21,637 --> 01:47:23,264
has a name.

2172
01:47:24,507 --> 01:47:26,701
His name is Robert Paulson.

2173
01:47:27,777 --> 01:47:36,875
His name is Robert Paulson.

2174
01:47:36,952 --> 01:47:38,284
Come on, guys, please, stop it.

2175
01:47:38,355 --> 01:47:42,517
His name is Robert Paulson.

2176
01:47:42,591 --> 01:47:44,617
Shut up!

2177
01:47:44,694 --> 01:47:45,683
This is all over with!

2178
01:47:45,762 --> 01:47:54,960
His name is Robert Paulson.

2179
01:47:55,038 --> 01:47:57,336
His name is Robert Paulson...

2180
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:22,289
Tyler?

2181
01:48:22,367 --> 01:48:23,628
No, this is Detective Stern

2182
01:48:23,701 --> 01:48:24,633
at the Arson Unit.

2183
01:48:24,702 --> 01:48:25,795
I need to see you in my office-

2184
01:48:30,778 --> 01:48:31,870
I went to all the cities

2185
01:48:31,946 --> 01:48:33,777
on Tyler's used ticket stubs,

2186
01:48:33,847 --> 01:48:34,778
barhopping.

2187
01:48:35,849 --> 01:48:37,146
I didn't know how or why,

2188
01:48:37,217 --> 01:48:38,844
but I could look at 50 different bars

2189
01:48:38,919 --> 01:48:40,510
and somehow I just knew.

2190
01:48:40,587 --> 01:48:41,555
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.

2191
01:48:41,622 --> 01:48:44,352
It's very important that I talk to him.

2192
01:48:44,425 --> 01:48:46,016
I wish I could help you.

2193
01:48:47,094 --> 01:48:48,027
Sir.

2194
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:55,798
Every city I went to...

2195
01:48:57,505 --> 01:48:59,837
as soon as I set foot off the plane,

2196
01:48:59,908 --> 01:49:02,139
I knew a Fight Club was close.

2197
01:49:03,211 --> 01:49:04,940
Hey! Hey!

2198
01:49:05,013 --> 01:49:06,605
Taxi!

2199
01:49:06,681 --> 01:49:08,149
Look at my face. I'm a member.

2200
01:49:08,217 --> 01:49:09,376
Now, I just need to know

2201
01:49:09,451 --> 01:49:11,419
if you’ve seen Tyler.

2202
01:49:11,486 --> 01:49:13,614
I'm not exposed to...

2203
01:49:13,689 --> 01:49:15,246
speak any such information to you,

2204
01:49:15,323 --> 01:49:17,052
nor would I, even if
I had said information

2205
01:49:17,125 --> 01:49:19,958
you want at this juncture, be able.

2206
01:49:21,630 --> 01:49:22,892
You're a moron.

2207
01:49:22,964 --> 01:49:24,330
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

2208
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:27,895
Tyler had been busy.

2209
01:49:27,970 --> 01:49:30,701
Setting up franchises
all over the country.

2210
01:49:33,509 --> 01:49:34,977
Was I asleep?

2211
01:49:36,446 --> 01:49:37,969
Had I slept?

2212
01:49:38,047 --> 01:49:39,606
Is Tyler my bad dream,

2213
01:49:39,683 --> 01:49:41,617
or am I Tyler's?

2214
01:49:41,685 --> 01:49:43,083
We’ve just heard the stories.

2215
01:49:43,152 --> 01:49:44,380
What kind of stories?

2216
01:49:44,454 --> 01:49:45,944
Like, nobody knows what he looks like.

2217
01:49:46,023 --> 01:49:46,955
He has facial

2218
01:49:47,024 --> 01:49:47,956
reconstructive surgery

2219
01:49:48,027 --> 01:49:49,118
every 3 years.

2220
01:49:49,193 --> 01:49:51,492
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

2221
01:49:51,563 --> 01:49:53,997
Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?

2222
01:49:54,066 --> 01:49:56,398
Is Mr. Durden building an army?

2223
01:49:56,468 --> 01:49:58,095
I was living in a state

2224
01:49:58,170 --> 01:50:00,331
of perpetual déjà vu.

2225
01:50:00,406 --> 01:50:01,998
Everywhere I went,

2226
01:50:02,074 --> 01:50:04,474
I felt I'd already been there.

2227
01:50:04,543 --> 01:50:08,480
It was like following an invisible man.

2228
01:50:08,548 --> 01:50:10,641
The smell of dried blood,

2229
01:50:10,717 --> 01:50:15,017
dirty, bare footprints
circling each other,

2230
01:50:15,088 --> 01:50:18,489
that aroma of old sweat,
like fried chicken.

2231
01:50:18,558 --> 01:50:20,287
The feel of a floor still warm

2232
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:21,953
from the fight the night before.

2233
01:50:22,029 --> 01:50:25,964
I was always just one step behind Tyler.

2234
01:50:28,502 --> 01:50:32,937
His name is Robert Paulson.

2235
01:50:33,007 --> 01:50:33,939
His-

2236
01:50:36,776 --> 01:50:38,108
Welcome back, sir.

2237
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:40,839
How have you been?

2238
01:50:42,582 --> 01:50:43,743
Do you know me?

2239
01:50:44,819 --> 01:50:46,308
Is this a test, sir?

2240
01:50:46,386 --> 01:50:48,288
No, this is not a test.

2241
01:50:48,356 --> 01:50:52,086
You were in here last Thursday.

2242
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:53,559
Thursday?

2243
01:50:53,628 --> 01:50:54,560
You were standing

2244
01:50:54,629 --> 01:50:55,994
exactly where you are now,

2245
01:50:56,064 --> 01:50:58,794
asking how good security is.

2246
01:50:58,867 --> 01:51:00,164
It's tight as a drum, sir.

2247
01:51:02,704 --> 01:51:05,070
Who do you think I am?

2248
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:07,700
Are you sure this isn't a test?

2249
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:09,712
No, this is not a test.

2250
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:13,181
You're Mr. Durden.

2251
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:15,810
You're the one who gave me this.

2252
01:51:16,954 --> 01:51:18,182
Please return your seat backs

2253
01:51:18,255 --> 01:51:20,917
to their full, upright
and locked position.

2254
01:51:31,771 --> 01:51:32,702
Yeah?

2255
01:51:32,771 --> 01:51:33,703
Marla, it's me.

2256
01:51:33,772 --> 01:51:35,000
Have we ever done it?

2257
01:51:35,073 --> 01:51:36,006
Done what?

2258
01:51:36,075 --> 01:51:37,201
Have we ever had sex?

2259
01:51:37,276 --> 01:51:39,436
What kind of stupid question is that?

2260
01:51:39,511 --> 01:51:40,877
Is it stupid because the answer's yes,

2261
01:51:40,946 --> 01:51:41,913
or because the answer's no?

2262
01:51:41,981 --> 01:51:43,447
Is this a trick?

2263
01:51:43,515 --> 01:51:44,777
No, Marla, I need to know-

2264
01:51:44,849 --> 01:51:46,009
You mean you want to know if I think

2265
01:51:46,084 --> 01:51:48,553
we were just having sex or making love?

2266
01:51:48,621 --> 01:51:50,781
We did make love.

2267
01:51:50,855 --> 01:51:52,016
Is that what you're calling it?

2268
01:51:52,091 --> 01:51:53,353
Just answer the question,

2269
01:51:53,425 --> 01:51:54,357
Marla, please!

2270
01:51:54,426 --> 01:51:55,414
Did we do it or not?

2271
01:51:55,493 --> 01:51:57,018
You fuck me, then snub me.

2272
01:51:57,096 --> 01:51:58,120
You love me, you hate me.

2273
01:51:58,197 --> 01:51:59,596
You show me a sensitive side,

2274
01:51:59,665 --> 01:52:01,154
then you turn into a total asshole.

2275
01:52:01,232 --> 01:52:02,257
Is that a pretty accurate description

2276
01:52:02,334 --> 01:52:03,699
of our relationship, Tyler?

2277
01:52:03,769 --> 01:52:06,430
We have just lost cabin pressure.

2278
01:52:06,504 --> 01:52:07,437
What did you just say?

2279
01:52:07,506 --> 01:52:08,531
What is wrong with you?

2280
01:52:08,608 --> 01:52:09,870
What did you call me? Say my name!

2281
01:52:09,943 --> 01:52:11,911
Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden,

2282
01:52:11,978 --> 01:52:13,605
you fucking freak. What's going on?

2283
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,612
I'm coming over.

2284
01:52:14,681 --> 01:52:15,670
No, wait, Marla, I'm not there-

2285
01:52:17,884 --> 01:52:19,647
You broke your promise.

2286
01:52:19,719 --> 01:52:20,708
Jesus, Tyler.

2287
01:52:20,787 --> 01:52:22,448
You fuckin' talked to her about me.

2288
01:52:22,522 --> 01:52:24,251
Tyler, what the fuck is going on here?

2289
01:52:24,324 --> 01:52:26,019
I asked you for one thing,

2290
01:52:26,092 --> 01:52:27,787
one simple thing.

2291
01:52:27,861 --> 01:52:29,058
Why do people think that I'm you?

2292
01:52:30,732 --> 01:52:31,926
Answer me!

2293
01:52:35,671 --> 01:52:36,603
Sit.

2294
01:52:40,009 --> 01:52:40,940
Now answer me.

2295
01:52:41,009 --> 01:52:42,499
Why do people think that I'm you?

2296
01:52:43,812 --> 01:52:44,802
I think you know.

2297
01:52:44,881 --> 01:52:46,405
No, I don't.

2298
01:52:46,482 --> 01:52:47,539
Yes, you do.

2299
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:50,280
Why would anyone possibly
confuse you with me?

2300
01:52:51,455 --> 01:52:54,184
Uh... I... I don't know.

2301
01:52:57,995 --> 01:52:59,359
You got it.

2302
01:52:59,429 --> 01:53:00,863
No.

2303
01:53:00,931 --> 01:53:01,898
Do not fuck with us.

2304
01:53:01,966 --> 01:53:03,155
Say it.

2305
01:53:04,656 --> 01:53:06,420
Because...

2306
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:08,918
Say it.

2307
01:53:10,829 --> 01:53:12,694
Because we're the same person.

2308
01:53:12,765 --> 01:53:14,926
That's right.

2309
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,161
We are the all-singing,
all dancing-

2310
01:53:17,236 --> 01:53:18,760
I don't understand this.

2311
01:53:18,837 --> 01:53:19,769
You were looking for a way

2312
01:53:19,838 --> 01:53:20,963
to change your life.

2313
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:23,338
You could not do this on your own.

2314
01:53:23,409 --> 01:53:25,309
All the ways you wish you could be,

2315
01:53:25,377 --> 01:53:26,935
that's me.

2316
01:53:28,013 --> 01:53:29,276
I look like you wanna look,

2317
01:53:29,349 --> 01:53:30,509
I fuck like you wanna fuck,

2318
01:53:30,584 --> 01:53:31,949
I am smart, capable,

2319
01:53:32,019 --> 01:53:34,179
and most importantly, I am free

2320
01:53:34,254 --> 01:53:35,778
in all the ways that you are not.

2321
01:53:35,855 --> 01:53:36,844
Oh, no.

2322
01:53:36,923 --> 01:53:37,856
Tyler's not here.

2323
01:53:37,925 --> 01:53:38,856
Tyler went away.

2324
01:53:38,925 --> 01:53:39,857
- Tyler's gone.
- What?

2325
01:53:39,926 --> 01:53:41,359
This is impossible.

2326
01:53:41,428 --> 01:53:42,987
- No.
- This is crazy.

2327
01:53:43,064 --> 01:53:44,394
People do it every day.

2328
01:53:44,464 --> 01:53:45,795
They talk to themselves.

2329
01:53:45,865 --> 01:53:48,027
They see themselves
as they'd like to be.

2330
01:53:48,102 --> 01:53:50,037
They don't have the courage you have,

2331
01:53:50,105 --> 01:53:51,299
to just run with it.

2332
01:53:55,144 --> 01:53:57,008
Naturally, you're
still wrestling with it,

2333
01:53:57,079 --> 01:53:58,547
so sometimes you're still you.

2334
01:53:58,615 --> 01:54:00,412
We should do this again sometime.

2335
01:54:00,483 --> 01:54:03,349
Other times, you imagine
yourself watching me.

2336
01:54:03,418 --> 01:54:04,750
If this is your first
night at Fight Club,

2337
01:54:04,821 --> 01:54:05,913
you have to fight.

2338
01:54:05,989 --> 01:54:07,319
Little by little,

2339
01:54:07,389 --> 01:54:10,690
you’re just letting yourself become...

2340
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:13,160
Tyler Durden.

2341
01:54:13,229 --> 01:54:14,253
You are not your job,

2342
01:54:14,331 --> 01:54:16,026
or how much money you have in the bank!

2343
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:17,260
No, you have a house.

2344
01:54:17,334 --> 01:54:18,527
Rented in your name.

2345
01:54:18,601 --> 01:54:20,536
You have jobs, you have a whole life.

2346
01:54:20,604 --> 01:54:22,196
You have night jobs
because you can't sleep.

2347
01:54:22,273 --> 01:54:24,103
Or you stay up and make soap.

2348
01:54:24,173 --> 01:54:25,698
Marla-You're fucking Marla, Tyler.

2349
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:27,744
Uh, technically, you're fucking Marla.

2350
01:54:27,811 --> 01:54:29,108
But it's all the same to her.

2351
01:54:31,448 --> 01:54:32,938
Oh, my God.

2352
01:54:34,018 --> 01:54:36,009
Now you see our dilemma.

2353
01:54:36,086 --> 01:54:38,111
She knows too much.

2354
01:54:39,256 --> 01:54:40,314
I think we're going to have to talk

2355
01:54:40,391 --> 01:54:43,588
about how this might
compromise our goals.

2356
01:54:43,661 --> 01:54:46,688
Wh-What are you saying?

2357
01:54:46,765 --> 01:54:48,425
This is
- This is bullshit.

2358
01:54:48,499 --> 01:54:49,990
This is bullshit.

2359
01:54:50,068 --> 01:54:51,035
I'm not listening to this.

2360
01:54:51,102 --> 01:54:52,035
You are insane.

2361
01:54:52,104 --> 01:54:53,934
No, you're insane.

2362
01:54:54,005 --> 01:54:56,530
And we simply do not
have time for this crap.

2363
01:54:59,110 --> 01:55:00,975
It's called a changeover.

2364
01:55:01,046 --> 01:55:02,571
The movie goes on,

2365
01:55:02,648 --> 01:55:04,081
and nobody in the audience

2366
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:05,707
has any idea.

2367
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:19,632
Sir!

2368
01:55:19,701 --> 01:55:21,032
Are you checking out?

2369
01:55:21,102 --> 01:55:22,295
Yeah, uh, b-bill me.

2370
01:55:22,369 --> 01:55:24,031
I need you to initial this list

2371
01:55:24,105 --> 01:55:25,197
of phone calls, please.

2372
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:30,371
When were these made?

2373
01:55:30,446 --> 01:55:31,640
It says right there, sir,

2374
01:55:31,714 --> 01:55:33,271
between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.

2375
01:55:33,348 --> 01:55:34,680
No, I w-

2376
01:55:38,587 --> 01:55:39,645
Have I been going to bed

2377
01:55:39,722 --> 01:55:40,984
earlier every night?

2378
01:55:41,056 --> 01:55:43,081
Have I been sleeping later?

2379
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:48,086
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?

2380
01:55:51,633 --> 01:55:52,565
Is anybody here?

2381
01:55:55,638 --> 01:55:58,470
Déjà vu all over again.

2382
01:55:59,541 --> 01:56:00,474
Yeah, with enough soap,

2383
01:56:00,543 --> 01:56:01,941
we could blow up just about anything.

2384
01:56:05,114 --> 01:56:07,140
Oh, my God.

2385
01:56:10,253 --> 01:56:11,221
1888.

2386
01:56:11,288 --> 01:56:12,550
I'm sorry, who am I calling?

2387
01:56:12,623 --> 01:56:14,590
1888 Franklin. This is Maintenance.

2388
01:56:16,694 --> 01:56:19,126
Hello?

2389
01:56:19,195 --> 01:56:21,060
1888 Franklin Street?

2390
01:56:21,131 --> 01:56:24,226
Yes. Can I help you?

2391
01:56:26,536 --> 01:56:28,164
Hello?

2392
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:29,365
Yeah, yeah.

2393
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:30,703
Uh, I need to talk to your supervisor

2394
01:56:30,776 --> 01:56:31,708
right away.

2395
01:56:31,777 --> 01:56:32,710
Speaking.

2396
01:56:32,779 --> 01:56:33,711
OK, listen to me.

2397
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:34,974
I think something really terrible

2398
01:56:35,047 --> 01:56:36,014
is about to happen at your building.

2399
01:56:36,081 --> 01:56:37,070
You have got-

2400
01:56:37,149 --> 01:56:38,378
It's under control, sir.

2401
01:56:39,752 --> 01:56:40,719
Excuse me?

2402
01:56:40,787 --> 01:56:42,344
Don't worry about us, sir.

2403
01:56:42,421 --> 01:56:43,821
We're solid.

2404
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:48,757
2160.

2405
01:56:56,703 --> 01:56:57,727
Marla! Marla!

2406
01:56:57,805 --> 01:56:59,796
Hey! Fuck! Wait!

2407
01:57:00,874 --> 01:57:02,569
Wait, I gotta talk to you!

2408
01:57:02,643 --> 01:57:03,804
Marla, Marla!

2409
01:57:03,878 --> 01:57:04,969
Your whacked-out bald freaks

2410
01:57:05,045 --> 01:57:06,512
hit me with a fucking broom!

2411
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:08,241
They almost broke my arm!

2412
01:57:08,315 --> 01:57:09,943
They were burning their
fingertips with lye,

2413
01:57:10,018 --> 01:57:11,006
the stink was unbelievable.

2414
01:57:11,084 --> 01:57:12,016
Look-Look, listen,

2415
01:57:12,085 --> 01:57:13,017
it's gonna take a tremendous act

2416
01:57:13,086 --> 01:57:14,018
of faith on your part,

2417
01:57:14,087 --> 01:57:15,055
but you've got to hear me out.

2418
01:57:15,123 --> 01:57:17,022
Oh, here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

2419
01:57:17,090 --> 01:57:18,557
A little more faith than that.

2420
01:57:22,930 --> 01:57:23,862
No, listen, I don't want to hear

2421
01:57:23,931 --> 01:57:24,864
anything you have to say.

2422
01:57:24,933 --> 01:57:26,992
You have every right to be...

2423
01:57:27,068 --> 01:57:29,126
Um, I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

2424
01:57:29,203 --> 01:57:32,140
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

2425
01:57:32,208 --> 01:57:34,266
Why is it free of charge?

2426
01:57:34,342 --> 01:57:35,434
Don't-Don't ask.

2427
01:57:35,511 --> 01:57:36,569
Whatever.

2428
01:57:36,645 --> 01:57:39,272
I'll have the clam
chowder, the fried chicken

2429
01:57:39,347 --> 01:57:40,439
with the baked potato with everything,

2430
01:57:40,515 --> 01:57:41,983
and a chocolate chiffon pie.

2431
01:57:42,051 --> 01:57:44,144
Clean food, please.

2432
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:45,982
In that case, sir, may I advise against

2433
01:57:46,055 --> 01:57:47,283
the lady eating the clam chowder?

2434
01:57:47,356 --> 01:57:49,347
No clam chowder, thank you.

2435
01:57:51,562 --> 01:57:53,086
You've got about 30 seconds.

2436
01:57:55,833 --> 01:57:56,765
Marla, I know that I've been acting

2437
01:57:56,834 --> 01:57:58,028
very, very strange.

2438
01:57:58,102 --> 01:58:00,263
OK, I know that it's got to seem

2439
01:58:00,338 --> 01:58:01,396
Like there's 2 sides to me-

2440
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:02,404
2 sides?

2441
01:58:02,473 --> 01:58:03,770
You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.

2442
01:58:03,841 --> 01:58:04,773
I deserve that, but-

2443
01:58:04,842 --> 01:58:06,002
I've come to realize something

2444
01:58:06,077 --> 01:58:07,009
very, very important.

2445
01:58:07,078 --> 01:58:08,136
What?

2446
01:58:08,212 --> 01:58:09,645
The full extent of our relationship

2447
01:58:09,714 --> 01:58:11,774
wasn't really clear to me up until now,

2448
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:13,045
for reasons I'm not going to go into,

2449
01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:14,551
but the important thing is, I know

2450
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:15,814
that I haven't been
treating you so nice.

2451
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:16,820
Yeah, whatever.

2452
01:58:16,889 --> 01:58:17,857
No, no
- 15 seconds.

2453
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:19,118
15 seconds, please, please.

2454
01:58:19,192 --> 01:58:21,022
15 seconds, don't open your mouth.

2455
01:58:21,093 --> 01:58:23,654
I'm trying to tell you that I'm sorry.

2456
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:24,924
Because what I've come to realize

2457
01:58:24,998 --> 01:58:27,761
is that I really like you, Marla.

2458
01:58:28,968 --> 01:58:30,265
You do?

2459
01:58:30,336 --> 01:58:31,859
I really do.

2460
01:58:31,937 --> 01:58:32,904
I care about you

2461
01:58:32,971 --> 01:58:33,996
and I don't want anything bad

2462
01:58:34,073 --> 01:58:36,632
to happen to you because of me.

2463
01:58:36,708 --> 01:58:39,405
Marla, your life is in danger.

2464
01:58:40,547 --> 01:58:41,479
What?

2465
01:58:41,548 --> 01:58:43,947
You need to leave town for a while.

2466
01:58:44,016 --> 01:58:45,279
Get out of any major city

2467
01:58:45,351 --> 01:58:46,477
and just go camping or something.

2468
01:58:46,553 --> 01:58:47,611
You're an insane person.

2469
01:58:47,687 --> 01:58:48,778
No, no, I've involved you

2470
01:58:48,854 --> 01:58:50,653
in something terrible
that's about to happen.

2471
01:58:50,724 --> 01:58:52,157
No. Shut up,

2472
01:58:52,226 --> 01:58:53,386
shut up!

2473
01:58:56,597 --> 01:58:58,326
Listen, I tried, Tyler.

2474
01:58:58,399 --> 01:58:59,558
I really tried.

2475
01:58:59,632 --> 01:59:00,565
I know you did.

2476
01:59:00,634 --> 01:59:02,602
There are things about you I like.

2477
01:59:02,670 --> 01:59:04,160
You're smart, you're funny,

2478
01:59:04,238 --> 01:59:06,604
you're spectacular in bed.

2479
01:59:06,674 --> 01:59:09,837
But you're intolerable.

2480
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:12,813
You have very serious
emotional problems.

2481
01:59:12,882 --> 01:59:14,645
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek

2482
01:59:14,717 --> 01:59:16,049
professional help.

2483
01:59:16,119 --> 01:59:17,517
I know, and I'm sorry.

2484
01:59:17,587 --> 01:59:18,451
Yeah, you're sorry, I'm sorry,

2485
01:59:18,521 --> 01:59:19,647
everyone's sorry. But...

2486
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:22,885
I can't do this anymore.

2487
01:59:23,993 --> 01:59:25,517
I can't.

2488
01:59:25,595 --> 01:59:26,585
And I won't.

2489
01:59:28,165 --> 01:59:29,188
I'm gone.

2490
01:59:30,901 --> 01:59:31,833
You can't leave, Marla,

2491
01:59:31,903 --> 01:59:33,572
you're not safe!

2492
01:59:37,476 --> 01:59:38,408
No! Leave me alone!

2493
01:59:38,477 --> 01:59:40,341
Marla, I'm trying to protect you.

2494
01:59:40,411 --> 01:59:41,935
I don't ever want to see you again!

2495
01:59:42,013 --> 01:59:43,675
That's fine, if that's what it takes...

2496
01:59:43,749 --> 01:59:45,080
You wait. Wait right here.

2497
01:59:49,755 --> 01:59:50,687
Hold it right there.

2498
01:59:50,756 --> 01:59:52,780
Shut up!

2499
01:59:52,857 --> 01:59:54,689
Take this money and get on this bus.

2500
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:55,692
And I promise you

2501
01:59:55,761 --> 01:59:56,750
I will never bother you again

2502
01:59:56,829 --> 01:59:57,760
if that's what you want.

2503
01:59:57,829 --> 01:59:59,058
Shut up!

2504
01:59:59,131 --> 02:00:00,462
Please get on the bus.

2505
02:00:00,532 --> 02:00:01,931
Please get on the bus!

2506
02:00:03,702 --> 02:00:04,862
Why are you doing this?

2507
02:00:04,937 --> 02:00:06,529
Because they think you're
some kind of a threat.

2508
02:00:06,605 --> 02:00:07,697
I- I can't explain it right now,

2509
02:00:07,773 --> 02:00:08,704
just trust me.

2510
02:00:08,773 --> 02:00:09,706
If I see where you're going,

2511
02:00:09,775 --> 02:00:10,708
you will not be safe.

2512
02:00:10,777 --> 02:00:11,971
I'm not paying this back.

2513
02:00:12,045 --> 02:00:13,512
I consider it asshole tax.

2514
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:15,673
That's fine. Remember,
stay out of major cities

2515
02:00:15,749 --> 02:00:16,875
for at least a couple of days, OK?

2516
02:00:16,950 --> 02:00:17,882
Tyler.

2517
02:00:19,486 --> 02:00:20,817
You're the worst thing

2518
02:00:20,887 --> 02:00:22,286
that ever happened to me.

2519
02:00:37,372 --> 02:00:38,737
Hello.

2520
02:00:38,807 --> 02:00:40,399
I need you to arrest me.

2521
02:00:40,475 --> 02:00:42,774
I am the leader of a
terrorist organization

2522
02:00:42,844 --> 02:00:45,142
responsible for numerous
acts of vandalism,

2523
02:00:45,213 --> 02:00:46,909
and assault all over this city.

2524
02:00:47,984 --> 02:00:49,211
...in the metropolitan area,

2525
02:00:49,284 --> 02:00:51,811
with probably a couple hundred members.

2526
02:00:51,889 --> 02:00:52,981
Chapters have sprung up

2527
02:00:53,057 --> 02:00:55,820
in 5 or 6 other major cities already.

2528
02:00:55,892 --> 02:00:58,953
This is a tightly
regimented organization,

2529
02:00:59,029 --> 02:01:01,121
with many cells capable of operating

2530
02:01:01,197 --> 02:01:04,224
completely independent
of central leadership.

2531
02:01:04,301 --> 02:01:06,427
Look, look, go to that house, OK?

2532
02:01:06,502 --> 02:01:08,630
1537 Paper Street.

2533
02:01:08,706 --> 02:01:10,640
That's our headquarters.

2534
02:01:10,708 --> 02:01:13,233
In the back, buried in the garden,

2535
02:01:13,310 --> 02:01:16,404
you'll find the body of Robert Paulson.

2536
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,414
In the basement,

2537
02:01:18,482 --> 02:01:19,676
you're gonna find some bathtubs

2538
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:21,274
that have been used very recently

2539
02:01:21,351 --> 02:01:25,378
to make large quantities
of nitroglycerin.

2540
02:01:25,456 --> 02:01:26,514
I believe the plan

2541
02:01:26,590 --> 02:01:28,354
is to blow up the headquarters

2542
02:01:28,426 --> 02:01:30,017
of these credit card companies,

2543
02:01:30,094 --> 02:01:31,960
and the T.R.W. Building.

2544
02:01:33,699 --> 02:01:34,926
Why these buildings?

2545
02:01:34,999 --> 02:01:37,024
Why credit card companies?

2546
02:01:37,102 --> 02:01:38,934
If you erase the debt record,

2547
02:01:39,004 --> 02:01:41,494
then we all go back to zero.

2548
02:01:41,573 --> 02:01:43,598
It'll create total chaos.

2549
02:01:46,377 --> 02:01:47,366
Keep him talking.

2550
02:01:47,445 --> 02:01:48,434
I need to make a phone call.

2551
02:01:59,326 --> 02:02:01,261
I really admire what you're doing.

2552
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:03,861
What?

2553
02:02:03,930 --> 02:02:06,126
You're a brave man to order this.

2554
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:07,861
You're a genius, sir.

2555
02:02:07,935 --> 02:02:10,871
You said, if anyone ever interferes

2556
02:02:10,939 --> 02:02:12,702
with Project
Mayhem- even you-

2557
02:02:12,775 --> 02:02:15,072
we gotta get his bails.

2558
02:02:16,545 --> 02:02:17,512
It's useless to fight.

2559
02:02:17,579 --> 02:02:18,705
This is really a powerful gesture,

2560
02:02:18,781 --> 02:02:19,713
Mr. Durden.

2561
02:02:19,782 --> 02:02:21,043
It'll set quite an example.

2562
02:02:21,115 --> 02:02:23,209
You're making a big mistake, fellas.

2563
02:02:23,285 --> 02:02:24,217
You said you'd say that.

2564
02:02:24,286 --> 02:02:25,753
I'm not Tyler Durden!

2565
02:02:25,821 --> 02:02:27,345
You told us you'd say that, too.

2566
02:02:27,422 --> 02:02:30,255
All right, I am Tyler Durden.

2567
02:02:30,325 --> 02:02:31,519
Listen to me,

2568
02:02:31,593 --> 02:02:33,151
I'm giving you a direct order.

2569
02:02:33,228 --> 02:02:35,219
We are aborting this mission, right now.

2570
02:02:35,297 --> 02:02:36,696
You said you would definitely say that.

2571
02:02:42,906 --> 02:02:43,929
Are you fucking out of your minds?

2572
02:02:44,006 --> 02:02:45,303
You're police officers!

2573
02:02:48,311 --> 02:02:49,436
Somebody timing this?

2574
02:02:49,511 --> 02:02:50,443
No! No!

2575
02:02:50,512 --> 02:02:52,037
Keep your mouth shut!

2576
02:02:53,117 --> 02:02:54,049
Shit.

2577
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:57,787
Yeah?

2578
02:02:57,854 --> 02:02:58,879
Hey, you know, some of this information

2579
02:02:58,956 --> 02:03:00,218
checks out.

2580
02:03:00,291 --> 02:03:01,848
Let's go over to that house

2581
02:03:01,925 --> 02:03:02,983
on Paper Street.

2582
02:03:03,059 --> 02:03:04,118
Be right there.

2583
02:03:05,196 --> 02:03:06,560
Hey! Wait!

2584
02:03:06,629 --> 02:03:07,857
I got him.

2585
02:03:07,931 --> 02:03:09,194
Sir, we have to do this, sir.

2586
02:03:09,266 --> 02:03:10,392
Stop fighting.

2587
02:03:10,467 --> 02:03:11,766
Where's the rubber band?

2588
02:03:11,838 --> 02:03:12,929
Get away from me!

2589
02:03:13,004 --> 02:03:13,936
Drop that fucking knife!

2590
02:03:14,005 --> 02:03:14,938
Drop it!

2591
02:03:18,176 --> 02:03:19,108
Back up.

2592
02:03:19,177 --> 02:03:20,236
Face down on the floor,

2593
02:03:20,313 --> 02:03:21,245
both of you, right now!

2594
02:03:23,815 --> 02:03:25,408
Get down on the floor!

2595
02:03:30,021 --> 02:03:31,991
First person comes out this fucking door

2596
02:03:32,059 --> 02:03:34,220
gets a-gets a lead
salad, you understand?

2597
02:03:59,253 --> 02:04:01,153
Get away! Get away!

2598
02:04:13,869 --> 02:04:15,335
I ran.

2599
02:04:16,871 --> 02:04:18,601
I ran until my muscles burned

2600
02:04:18,674 --> 02:04:20,801
and my veins pumped battery acid.

2601
02:04:23,579 --> 02:04:25,240
Then I ran some more.

2602
02:05:06,858 --> 02:05:08,689
What the fuck are you doing?

2603
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,352
Running around in your underpants.

2604
02:05:10,429 --> 02:05:11,727
Man, you look like a crazy person.

2605
02:05:11,798 --> 02:05:13,526
No, I'm onto you.

2606
02:05:13,598 --> 02:05:14,724
I know what's going on here.

2607
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:15,858
Well come on, then.

2608
02:05:15,935 --> 02:05:17,425
I got us a great place to watch from.

2609
02:05:18,804 --> 02:05:19,862
It'll be like
pay-per-view.

2610
02:06:08,824 --> 02:06:09,757
Oh, Christ.

2611
02:06:09,826 --> 02:06:11,726
Now what are you doing?

2612
02:06:11,795 --> 02:06:12,887
I'm stopping this.

2613
02:06:12,963 --> 02:06:15,989
Why? Greatest thing
you've ever done, man.

2614
02:06:16,066 --> 02:06:17,693
No, I can't let this happen.

2615
02:06:17,768 --> 02:06:19,292
You know there are 10 other bombs

2616
02:06:19,369 --> 02:06:20,837
in 10 other buildings.

2617
02:06:20,905 --> 02:06:22,269
God damn it, since
when is Project Mayhem

2618
02:06:22,339 --> 02:06:23,271
about murder?

2619
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:24,637
The buildings are empty.

2620
02:06:24,709 --> 02:06:26,267
Security and maintenance,
all our people.

2621
02:06:26,344 --> 02:06:27,537
We're not killing anyone, man,

2622
02:06:27,611 --> 02:06:28,839
we're setting 'em free.

2623
02:06:28,912 --> 02:06:29,844
Bob is dead.

2624
02:06:29,913 --> 02:06:31,643
They shot him in the head.

2625
02:06:31,716 --> 02:06:32,977
You wanna make an omelet,

2626
02:06:33,050 --> 02:06:34,608
you gotta break some eggs.

2627
02:06:34,684 --> 02:06:35,947
No, I'm not listening to you.

2628
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:37,078
You're not even there.

2629
02:06:44,895 --> 02:06:45,862
Wouldn't do that.

2630
02:06:45,930 --> 02:06:48,694
Not unless I knew which wires were what.

2631
02:06:48,766 --> 02:06:50,426
If you know, then I know.

2632
02:06:56,107 --> 02:06:57,040
Or...

2633
02:06:57,109 --> 02:06:58,041
maybe I knew you'd know,

2634
02:06:58,110 --> 02:06:59,134
so I spent the whole day

2635
02:06:59,211 --> 02:07:00,371
thinking about the wrong ones.

2636
02:07:09,023 --> 02:07:10,012
You think?

2637
02:07:12,062 --> 02:07:13,859
Oh, heavens no, not the green one.

2638
02:07:15,031 --> 02:07:16,362
Pull any one but the green one.

2639
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:24,105
I asked you not to do that!

2640
02:07:29,714 --> 02:07:31,010
Tyler, get away from the van.

2641
02:07:34,052 --> 02:07:35,485
Tyler, I'm not kidding!

2642
02:07:35,554 --> 02:07:37,453
Get away from the van!

2643
02:07:37,521 --> 02:07:38,783
God damn it!

2644
02:07:40,092 --> 02:07:42,558
Whoa!

2645
02:07:45,764 --> 02:07:48,561
OK, you are now firing a gun

2646
02:07:48,633 --> 02:07:49,896
at your imaginary friend

2647
02:07:49,968 --> 02:07:52,664
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

2648
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:56,635
Look, Tyler, Tyler!

2649
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:00,973
Ahh!

2650
02:08:10,122 --> 02:08:11,783
Aw, come on.

2651
02:08:11,857 --> 02:08:13,052
Don't go.

2652
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:52,861
What?!

2653
02:09:38,783 --> 02:09:39,943
3 minutes.

2654
02:09:40,018 --> 02:09:42,316
This is it.

2655
02:09:42,387 --> 02:09:44,446
The beginning.

2656
02:09:44,522 --> 02:09:46,491
Ground zero.

2657
02:09:46,558 --> 02:09:48,525
I think this is about where we came in.

2658
02:09:48,593 --> 02:09:49,560
Would you like to say a few words

2659
02:09:49,627 --> 02:09:51,425
to mark the occasion?

2660
02:09:53,334 --> 02:09:54,527
I'm sorry?

2661
02:09:54,601 --> 02:09:57,230
I still can't think of anything.

2662
02:09:58,906 --> 02:10:01,032
Ah, flashback humor.

2663
02:10:06,246 --> 02:10:07,908
It's getting exciting now.

2664
02:10:10,284 --> 02:10:11,307
2 and 1/2.

2665
02:10:11,384 --> 02:10:12,317
Think of everything

2666
02:10:12,386 --> 02:10:13,911
we've accomplished, man.

2667
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:17,120
Out these windows, we will view

2668
02:10:17,191 --> 02:10:18,784
the collapse of financial history.

2669
02:10:19,961 --> 02:10:22,327
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

2670
02:10:37,279 --> 02:10:38,644
Why is she here?

2671
02:10:38,713 --> 02:10:40,647
Tying up loose ends.

2672
02:10:40,715 --> 02:10:43,809
Put me down, you bald-headed fucks!

2673
02:10:43,885 --> 02:10:45,114
I'm begging you,

2674
02:10:45,188 --> 02:10:46,119
please don't do this.

2675
02:10:46,188 --> 02:10:47,120
I'm not doing this.

2676
02:10:47,189 --> 02:10:48,884
We are doing this.

2677
02:10:48,957 --> 02:10:50,016
This is what we want.

2678
02:10:50,093 --> 02:10:52,151
No, I don't want this.

2679
02:10:52,227 --> 02:10:55,357
Right, except you is meaningless now.

2680
02:10:55,432 --> 02:10:57,092
We have to forget about you.

2681
02:10:57,166 --> 02:10:59,430
Jesus, you're a voice in my head.

2682
02:10:59,502 --> 02:11:00,800
You're a voice in mine.

2683
02:11:00,871 --> 02:11:02,338
You're a fucking hallucination,

2684
02:11:02,406 --> 02:11:03,531
why can't I get rid of you?

2685
02:11:03,606 --> 02:11:04,538
You need me.

2686
02:11:04,607 --> 02:11:06,736
No, I don't, I really don't anymore.

2687
02:11:06,870 --> 02:11:07,894
Hey, you created me.

2688
02:11:07,971 --> 02:11:09,733
I didn't create some loser alter ego

2689
02:11:09,805 --> 02:11:11,273
to make myself feel better.

2690
02:11:11,341 --> 02:11:12,399
Take some responsibility.

2691
02:11:12,475 --> 02:11:13,671
I do.

2692
02:11:13,745 --> 02:11:15,735
I am responsible for all of it,

2693
02:11:15,814 --> 02:11:16,906
and I accept that.

2694
02:11:16,982 --> 02:11:19,246
So please, I'm begging you,

2695
02:11:19,317 --> 02:11:20,977
please call this off.

2696
02:11:23,321 --> 02:11:25,186
Have I ever let us down?

2697
02:11:26,658 --> 02:11:28,956
How far have you come because of me?

2698
02:11:34,901 --> 02:11:36,892
I will bring us through this.

2699
02:11:36,968 --> 02:11:38,903
As always,

2700
02:11:38,971 --> 02:11:41,166
I will carry you, kicking and screaming,

2701
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:43,367
and in the end, you will thank me.

2702
02:11:43,442 --> 02:11:45,342
Tyler.

2703
02:11:45,411 --> 02:11:47,607
Tyler, I'm grateful to you

2704
02:11:47,681 --> 02:11:48,942
for everything

2705
02:11:49,015 --> 02:11:50,004
that you've done for me.

2706
02:11:50,082 --> 02:11:51,640
But this is too much.

2707
02:11:51,717 --> 02:11:53,242
I don't want this.

2708
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:54,251
What do you want?!

2709
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:55,582
Want to go back to the shit-job,

2710
02:11:55,655 --> 02:11:58,123
fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

2711
02:11:58,192 --> 02:12:00,159
Fuck you. I won't do it.

2712
02:12:00,226 --> 02:12:02,888
Oh, God, this can't be happening.

2713
02:12:02,962 --> 02:12:05,431
It's already done, so shut up.

2714
02:12:05,499 --> 02:12:06,430
60 seconds.

2715
02:12:06,499 --> 02:12:07,864
Can you see alright?

2716
02:12:10,704 --> 02:12:12,136
I can figure this out.

2717
02:12:12,205 --> 02:12:13,764
I can figure this out,
this isn't even real.

2718
02:12:13,841 --> 02:12:15,833
You're not real, that gun isn't-

2719
02:12:15,910 --> 02:12:17,672
That gun isn't even in your hand.

2720
02:12:19,213 --> 02:12:20,704
The gun's in my hand.

2721
02:12:26,321 --> 02:12:28,720
Hey, good for you.
Doesn't change a thing.

2722
02:12:37,634 --> 02:12:40,329
Why do you want to
put a gun to your head?

2723
02:12:40,402 --> 02:12:43,236
Not my head, Tyler.

2724
02:12:43,306 --> 02:12:45,069
Our head.

2725
02:12:46,810 --> 02:12:48,209
Interesting.

2726
02:12:51,581 --> 02:12:54,346
Where are you going
with this, I KEA boy?

2727
02:13:01,125 --> 02:13:04,583
Hey, it's you and me.

2728
02:13:07,566 --> 02:13:08,498
Friends.

2729
02:13:10,534 --> 02:13:11,466
Tyler...

2730
02:13:14,473 --> 02:13:17,373
I want you to really listen to me.

2731
02:13:17,441 --> 02:13:18,374
OK.

2732
02:13:21,412 --> 02:13:23,074
My eyes are open.

2733
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:42,800
What's that smell?

2734
02:14:03,058 --> 02:14:04,616
Where is everybody?

2735
02:14:04,693 --> 02:14:05,888
I don't know, what's goin' on?

2736
02:14:06,962 --> 02:14:08,224
Mr. Durden!

2737
02:14:09,297 --> 02:14:10,663
Oh, my God.

2738
02:14:10,733 --> 02:14:11,665
Sir?

2739
02:14:16,206 --> 02:14:17,332
Are you, uh...

2740
02:14:17,407 --> 02:14:19,237
Are you alright, sir?

2741
02:14:19,308 --> 02:14:20,536
Oh, yeah, I'm OK.

2742
02:14:20,609 --> 02:14:21,542
You look terrible, sir.

2743
02:14:21,611 --> 02:14:23,272
What happened?

2744
02:14:23,347 --> 02:14:25,541
Oh, nothing. It's no problem.

2745
02:14:25,614 --> 02:14:27,378
Oh, no, no, sir, he's not kidding.

2746
02:14:27,451 --> 02:14:28,611
You look really awful.

2747
02:14:28,685 --> 02:14:29,844
You need medical assistance.

2748
02:14:29,919 --> 02:14:31,386
- I'm fine.
- Ugh.

2749
02:14:31,454 --> 02:14:32,444
Look, I'm fine.

2750
02:14:32,522 --> 02:14:35,012
Everything's fine.

2751
02:14:38,528 --> 02:14:40,553
Let-Let her go.

2752
02:14:40,629 --> 02:14:41,618
Christ almighty!

2753
02:14:41,697 --> 02:14:43,563
You!

2754
02:14:43,633 --> 02:14:46,067
Hi, Marla.

2755
02:14:47,136 --> 02:14:48,104
Leave her with me,

2756
02:14:48,171 --> 02:14:49,103
get your stuff,

2757
02:14:49,172 --> 02:14:50,104
I'll meet you downstairs.

2758
02:14:50,173 --> 02:14:51,105
Are you sure?

2759
02:14:51,174 --> 02:14:53,142
Yes, I'm sure.

2760
02:14:54,312 --> 02:14:56,280
You fucker!

2761
02:14:56,347 --> 02:14:57,279
What kind of sick fucking game

2762
02:14:57,348 --> 02:14:58,280
are you playing now,

2763
02:14:58,349 --> 02:14:59,281
putting me on a fucking bu-

2764
02:14:59,350 --> 02:15:01,250
Oh, my God, your face!

2765
02:15:01,319 --> 02:15:02,752
Yeah, I know.

2766
02:15:07,558 --> 02:15:09,492
What happened?

2767
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:10,720
Don't ask.

2768
02:15:10,795 --> 02:15:11,727
You're shot.

2769
02:15:11,796 --> 02:15:13,161
Yes, I'm shot.

2770
02:15:13,231 --> 02:15:14,758
Oh, my God.

2771
02:15:14,835 --> 02:15:16,267
I can't believe he's standing.

2772
02:15:16,336 --> 02:15:17,769
One tough motherfucker.

2773
02:15:21,641 --> 02:15:23,506
Who did this?

2774
02:15:23,576 --> 02:15:26,102
I did, actually.

2775
02:15:26,180 --> 02:15:27,578
Find some gauze.

2776
02:15:29,582 --> 02:15:31,642
You shot yourself?

2777
02:15:31,719 --> 02:15:32,776
Yes, but it's OK.

2778
02:15:32,852 --> 02:15:34,411
Marla, look at me.

2779
02:15:34,488 --> 02:15:36,753
I'm really OK.

2780
02:15:36,825 --> 02:15:38,792
Trust me.

2781
02:15:38,859 --> 02:15:40,589
Everything's gonna be fine.

2782
02:15:53,675 --> 02:15:55,471
You met me at a very
strange time in my life.
