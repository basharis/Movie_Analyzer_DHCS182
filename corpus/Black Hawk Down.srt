2
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,541
There.

3
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,812
Technicals, nine o'clock.

4
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,072
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

5
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:09,437
Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

6
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,279
I got it, Matt. I don't think we can touch this.

7
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,419
Command, Super 64...

8
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:26,295
we got militia shooting unarmed civilians
down at the food distribution center.

9
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,993
Request permission to engage.

10
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,794
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.

11
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,737
Negative, command.

12
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,898
U.N. 's jurisdiction, 64. We cannot intervene.

13
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,034
- Return to base. Over.
- Roger.

14
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,278
64 returning.

15
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,431
Leaving.

16
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,336
General Garrison?

17
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,967
No, no, thanks. I got one.

18
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,374
But these are Cuban.

19
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,979
Bolivar Belicoso.

20
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,641
So is this.

21
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,977
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

22
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,663
I see not catching Aidid
is becoming a routine.

23
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,032
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.

24
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,125
Me?

25
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,465
But am I that important?

26
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,730
I hardly think so.

27
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,999
- You're just a businessman.
- Trying to make a living.

28
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,873
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

29
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,545
You've been here, what?

30
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,545
Six weeks?

31
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,786
Six weeks
you are trying to catch the general.

32
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,490
You put up reward posters.

33
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:49,330
$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?

34
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,971
It's the O.K. Corral.

35
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,840
Do you think bringing me in
will make him suddenly come to you?

36
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,140
Make him more agreeable?

37
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,980
You know where he sleeps.

38
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,720
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.

39
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,617
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.

40
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,888
And we will find him.

41
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,955
Don't make the mistake of thinking
because I grew up without running water...

42
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,659
I am simple, General.

43
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,030
I do know something about history.

44
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,467
See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.

45
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,006
A tomorrow without a lot
of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

46
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,346
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm from Texas.

47
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:42,614
Mr. Garrison,
I think you shouldn't have come here.

48
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,813
This is civil war.

49
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,625
This is our war.

50
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,990
Not yours.

51
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,628
300,000 dead and counting.

52
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,200
That's not a war, Mr. Atto. That's genocide.

53
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,972
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

54
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,710
How'd he strike you?

55
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,975
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

56
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,815
Yeah, he's a good catch.

57
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,678
It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

58
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,419
I'm not sure time is something we got
in great supply.

59
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:24,190
This isn't Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.

60
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,064
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

61
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,193
I'm just saying they've been calling
for these dang situation reports...

62
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,998
every morning this week.

63
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,771
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

64
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,116
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.

65
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,812
I'll be your pilot this afternoon.

66
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,983
Federal regulations has designated
the non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

67
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,720
For those of you moved on
Mogadishu frequent flyer program...

68
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,819
you'll be earning 100 free credits
this afternoon.

69
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:01,424
And as always, the air sickness bags
are located in the seatback in front of you.

70
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,127
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.

71
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,669
You're still clear.

72
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,212
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.

73
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,918
I've got some bad news.

74
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,558
"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don't want to hear about it.

75
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,565
It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.

76
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,624
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

77
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:39,694
That is the key phrase in Scrabble,
my good friend. Common usage.

78
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,605
No, if it's not in the dictionary
it doesn't count!

79
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,870
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

80
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,105
It does have to be in the dictionary!

81
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,740
Listen, when we get back to the base,
it's coming off the board.

82
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,582
You touch my "limo" and I'll spank you,
Nightstalker. You hear me?

83
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,212
Yeah, promises.

84
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,890
That's a nice beach down there.

85
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,723
How's the water?

86
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,691
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.

87
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,034
That's great.

88
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,873
- Thinks he's funny.
- Yeah. Well, I don't.

89
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,207
Hear that?

90
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,410
- Nervous?
- I'm ready to go, man.

91
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,991
Beautiful day to fight.

92
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,926
- Name.
- Todd.

93
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,761
- Last name.
- Blackburn.

94
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,130
First name, Todd.

95
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,300
- So, what's it like?
- What's what like?

96
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,772
Mogadishu. The fighting.

97
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,402
- Serial number.
- 72163427.

98
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,709
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog."
No one calls it Mogadishu here.

99
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:01,082
Secondly, I wouldn't know
about the fighting, so don't ask.

100
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:02,776
Why not?

101
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,257
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

102
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,386
You're not a Ranger.

103
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,693
I am a Ranger. Six years.

104
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,833
I was in Panama chasing down Noriega,
and in the Gulf.

105
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,391
I'm a vet, my friend.

106
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,664
In combat?

107
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:23,366
Look, kid, you look like you're about 12,
so let me explain something to you.

108
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:27,742
I have a rare and mysterious skill
that precludes me from going into missions.

109
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,438
Typing.

110
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,616
- Can you type?
- No.

111
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,311
- Date of birth.
- 2-27-75.

112
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,157
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

113
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,227
Let's bring it in.

114
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,981
Nice, man! Very smooth!

115
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,411
Single shot through the engine block.

116
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,517
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.

117
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,185
Cease fire! Cease fire!

118
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,027
Fucking Delta.

119
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,058
Sergeant Eversmann.

120
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,930
- Sergeant.
- Yeah?

121
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,901
Private First Class Blackburn.

122
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,129
Yeah?

123
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,895
Reporting for duty.

124
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,132
Not to me you're not.
You're reporting to It. Beales.

125
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,404
He should be around here somewhere.

126
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,273
Can I leave him with you?

127
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,212
Yeah, go ahead.

128
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,308
- You brought your weapon.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,284
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

130
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,521
- When did you get in?
- Just now, Sarg'nt.

131
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,348
First things first.

132
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,590
This will be your best friend in all of Africa.

133
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,354
It's called BullFrog.

134
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,862
Get some on over here, all right?

135
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,230
Yes, sir.

136
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,259
Hey, Schmid! Take over for me, would you?

137
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,802
All right. Let's get you unpacked.

138
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,915
Hey, who's hungry?

139
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,497
What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

140
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,339
- Not if General Garrison is asking.
- I'm asking.

141
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,208
Have a nice meal, Captain.

142
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,216
- Hey, man, there's a line.
- I know.

143
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,456
- Well, this isn't the back of it.
- Yeah, I know.

144
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,521
Sergeant. Sergeant.

145
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,490
What's going on here?

146
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,532
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.

147
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,534
I'm talking about your weapon.

148
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,263
Now, Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

149
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:43,005
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.

150
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,043
Well, this is my safety, sir.

151
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,207
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

152
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,446
You Delta boys
are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

153
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,718
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

154
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,555
When we get on the five-yard line,
you're going to need my Rangers.

155
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,284
So y'all better learn to be team players.

156
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,861
We're done here.

157
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,835
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

158
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,109
Well, this is my boot, son.

159
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,481
And it will fit up your asses
with the proper amount of force.

160
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:29,112
- Is that a Jersey accent?
- I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

161
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,386
Take those sunglasses off, soldier.

162
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,891
Delta wants to wear Oakleys,
that's their business.

163
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,655
I don't want to see them on you again.
Hoo-ah?

164
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,454
Is that a hot weapon?

165
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,369
Is that your move?

166
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,403
Is my hand on the piece?

167
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,867
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

168
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,206
I'd keep my eye on that queen
before counseling with the others.

169
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,583
Well, she's just lying in wait.

170
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,121
Stranded and condemned, Gordy.

171
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,347
Your move.

172
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,681
Cribbs.

173
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,749
Yikes.

174
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,590
It's good. You're really improving.

175
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,266
If I may make a suggestion... Observation.

176
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,428
Go ahead.

177
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,836
- It's a children's book, right?
- Right.

178
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:25,603
They are not supposed to scare
the living shit out of the children.

179
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,975
This is the part of the story
where our knight, our warrior...

180
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,514
is about to slay the one-eyed dragon.

181
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,243
That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

182
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,512
Thought you finished that last week.

183
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,215
You done?

184
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,354
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.

185
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,917
You understand?

186
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,991
Can you count? One, two, ten.

187
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,459
Okay? Where are my running backs?

188
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,430
Where are my running backs?

189
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,098
Hey, I didn't see you at church
on Sunday, soldier.

190
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,366
You had something more important to do?

191
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,934
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

192
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,412
I will make you believe, you understand?

193
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,020
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

194
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,960
It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.

195
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,540
All right, carry on.

196
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,442
- I'd like a word, specialist.
- Sir.

197
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,438
Tell me, Pilla, you understand why we have
a chain of command, don't you?

198
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,676
Roger that, sir.

199
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,547
'Cause if I ever see you
undermine me again...

200
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,450
you'll be cleaning latrines
with your tongue...

201
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,115
till you can't taste the difference
between shit and French fries.

202
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,555
- Are we clear?
- Hoo-ah, sir.

203
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,614
All right.

204
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,664
Listen to this:

205
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:01,502
If one skinny kills another skinny, his clan
owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

206
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,037
A hundred camels.

207
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,633
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

208
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,974
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

209
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,505
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

210
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,982
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes the skinnies.

211
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,679
Sgt. Eversmann,
you really like the skinnies?

212
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,224
It's not that I like them or I don't like them.
I respect them.

213
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:24,752
See, what you guys fail to realize
is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

214
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,391
He believes in this mission down
to his very bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

215
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,732
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

216
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:36,096
no food, no education, no future.

217
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,736
I just figure that, I mean,
we have two things that we can do.

218
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,108
We can either help...

219
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,616
or we can sit back and watch
the country destroy itself on CNN.

220
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:45,906
Right?

221
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,512
I don't know about you guys,
but I was trained to fight.

222
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,488
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

223
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,685
Well, I think I was trained
to make a difference, Kurth.

224
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,018
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

225
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,792
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

226
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,137
Stay away from the cans!

227
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,399
Die, gas-pumper!

228
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,208
Stay away from those cans!

229
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,442
Beales!

230
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,108
No, no, stay back, stay back.

231
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,178
He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.

232
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,985
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.

233
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,870
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.

234
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,342
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.

235
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,050
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

236
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,621
- You got a problem with that?
- No, sir.

237
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,784
Now, it's a big responsibility.

238
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,090
Your men are gonna look to you
to make the right decisions.

239
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,857
Their lives depend on it.

240
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,593
All right.

241
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,034
- Rangers lead the way, sir.
- All the way.

242
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,194
Good luck, Sergeant.

243
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:35,449
A long anticipated meeting of Aidid's senior
cabinet may take place today at 1500 hours.

244
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,257
I say "may" because we all know by now...

245
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:42,418
with the intel we get on the street,
nothing is certain.

246
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,527
This is actual intel
confirmed by three sources.

247
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,591
Two tier-one personalities may be present:

248
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,803
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

249
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,466
and Abdi Hassan Awale, Interior Minister.

250
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,566
These are the guys we're after.

251
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,809
Today we go.

252
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,371
Same mission template as before.

253
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:08,312
1545, Assault Force Delta
will infiltrate the target building...

254
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,615
and seize all suspects within.

255
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:15,056
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks,
under the command of Captain Steele...

256
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,220
will rope in at 1546...

257
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,662
and hold a four-corner perimeter
around the target building.

258
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,657
No one gets in or out.

259
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,258
Extraction Force:

260
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:29,470
It. Colonel McKnight's humvee column
will drive into the city at 1547...

261
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:33,375
on Hawlwadig Road and hold just short
of the Olympic Hotel here.

262
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,037
Wait for the green light.

263
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,138
Now once Delta gives the word...

264
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,740
McKnight's column
will move to the target building...

265
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,252
and load the prisoners on flatbed trucks.

266
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,020
Immediately after the prisoners are loaded...

267
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,186
the four Ranger chalks
will collapse back to the target building...

268
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,055
load up on humvees...

269
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,997
and the entire ground force
will exfil the 3 miles back to base.

270
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,832
Mission time from incursion to extraction,
no longer than 30 minutes.

271
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:04,540
Now, I had requested light armor
and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

272
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,272
but Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

273
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,777
Too high-profile.

274
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,114
So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover...

275
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,381
with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

276
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,953
Colonel Harrell.

277
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,917
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission...

278
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,028
and I will coordinate ground forces.

279
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,561
Colonel Matthews.

280
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,931
Mission launch code word is Irene.

281
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,662
Questions?

282
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,369
Which building is it, sir?

283
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,433
Exactly which building,
we're confirming right now.

284
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,843
Somewhere around the Bakara Market.

285
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,740
I don't choose the time or place
of their meetings.

286
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,715
I didn't say a word, sir.

287
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,556
Make no mistake,
once you're in the Bakara Market...

288
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,024
you're in an entirely hostile district.

289
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,119
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

290
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,859
Now we'll be going through friendly
neighborhoods before we hit the market...

291
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:06,131
so remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.

292
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,902
Now, let's go get this thing done.

293
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,635
Good luck, gentlemen.

294
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,516
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?

295
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,084
No Spectre gunships,
daylight instead of night...

296
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,849
late afternoon when they're all fucked up
on khat...

297
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:29,451
only part of the city Aidid can mount
a serious counter-attack on short notice...

298
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,156
- What's not to like?
- Life's imperfect.

299
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,961
Yeah. For you two,
circling above it at 500 feet, it's imperfect.

300
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,561
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

301
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,970
You two say hello to me from up there.

302
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,468
You'll do fine.

303
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,641
Thanks.

304
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,703
What the fuck, Smith?

305
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,143
- Well?
- Well, what?

306
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:27,813
We going?

307
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,845
- Why should I tell you that?
- Because I'm me.

308
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,620
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

309
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,091
- Bakara Market.
- All right.

310
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,999
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up
out there today, all right?

311
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,396
Keep sharp.

312
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,200
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

313
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,774
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

314
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,708
Nothing.

315
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,640
Hey.

316
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:00,980
Sit down.

317
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:09,892
How'd this happen?

318
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,519
I don't even remember.

319
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,724
Think I was just goofing off.
Playing ping-pong, I think.

320
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,765
Sort of hit the concrete.

321
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,059
Okay.

322
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,873
You can fix it up though.
We're going out today.

323
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,213
You're not going anywhere.

324
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,838
Jesus Christ!

325
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:37,154
It's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

326
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,284
This, my friend, is a science.

327
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,888
I mean, you're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials.

328
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,328
You know, about "be all you can be."

329
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,396
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

330
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,829
I made coffee through Panama,
while everyone else got to fight...

331
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,735
got to be a Ranger.

332
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,202
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar"
or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

333
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,940
- What happened to you?
- Ping-Pong accident.

334
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,207
What?

335
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,719
So guess what.

336
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:14,191
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.

337
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,783
You're fucking me.

338
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,688
You're taking my place
assisting the 60 gunner.

339
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,857
Sergeant Eversmann said
to get your stuff and get ready.

340
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,202
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

341
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,601
Oh, yeah.

342
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,499
Hell, yeah.

343
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:33,237
Grimesy, I want you to stick with Waddell
and give him ammo when he needs it.

344
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,642
- Hoo-ah?
- Hoo-ah.

345
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:39,207
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally
speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

346
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,306
Don't worry about it.

347
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,479
Just watch out for the sammys
throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

348
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,681
Might even be fun.

349
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,783
D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.

350
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,988
Choppers going to cover us,
and we'll be all right.

351
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:56,365
Look, you guys, I know
this is my first time as chalk leader...

352
00:28:56,601 --> 00:29:00,002
but, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.

353
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,468
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

354
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,437
We're elite.

355
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,270
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

356
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,472
Hoo-ah!

357
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,037
Any questions?

358
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,250
We're going to be okay.

359
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,185
All right, grab your gear. Let's move out.

360
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:54,254
You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.

361
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,627
You're not gonna need that, either.

362
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,533
We'll be back before dark.

363
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,164
You might as well take dope
and beer instead.

364
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,432
What?

365
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,807
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

366
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,685
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got about 50 pounds of gear as it is.

367
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,188
You don't need another 12.

368
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:29,590
I don't know about you, but I don't plan
on getting shot in the back running away.

369
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,288
Well, I better keep mine in.

370
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,522
Hey, Grimes.

371
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,292
The most important thing:

372
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,261
Just remember, when everybody else
is shooting, shoot in the same direction.

373
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,396
All right.

374
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,874
Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.

375
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,112
- That's bad luck.
- No, it's smart.

376
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,417
All Delta do that.

377
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,417
That's bad luck, too, man.

378
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,389
Come on, let's go.

379
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,357
It's a good thing
you're right-handed, Adonis.

380
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:12,562
- If not, I don't know what you'd do.
- You're a funny guy, man.

381
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,303
- I'm not taking no death letter.
- We have a deal.

382
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,206
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

383
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:26,180
- Blackburn, you okay?
- Excited.

384
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,544
In a good way.
I've been training my whole life for this.

385
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,915
You ever shot at anybody before?

386
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,481
No, sir.

387
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,256
Me neither.

388
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,030
Think he's reliable?

389
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,625
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.

390
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,201
- Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
- Yes, sir.

391
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,974
Tell him to turn his radio off.

392
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:33,040
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

393
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:43,587
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy,
leave us a message. Thank you.

394
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,524
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?

395
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,163
Pick up if you're there.

396
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,604
I'm just calling to check up on you,
make sure everything's all right.

397
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,103
I'll call you in a couple hours.

398
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,111
You'd better not be sleeping.

399
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,613
Your move, Randy.

400
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,109
I'm missing you.

401
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,647
I love you, baby.

402
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,590
Hello? Hello?

403
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,025
Thanks, bud.

404
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,234
- Sorry, I didn't see you there.
- It's all right.

405
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,855
You know, it's kind of funny.

406
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,057
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

407
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,926
Could almost be a good place to visit.

408
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,191
Almost.

409
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,263
You don't think we should be here.

410
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:05,632
You know what I think?
It don't really matter what I think.

411
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:11,280
Once that first bullet goes past your head,
politics and all that shit...

412
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,573
just goes right out the window.

413
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,277
I just want to do it right today.

414
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:21,118
Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.

415
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,116
Now, is this supposed to be the place,
or did his car just take a dump?

416
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,621
Abdi, come in.

417
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,717
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?

418
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,192
Abdi, come in.

419
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,700
Can you hear me? Abdi.

420
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,798
Abdi, come in. Is this the place?

421
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,578
To my right hand side, above the cafe.

422
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,276
Sir, he says this is the building.

423
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,781
He's certain?

424
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,374
Abdi, you need to be sure.

425
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,919
Are you sure?

426
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:28,820
Well, it's down the road,
two blocks over on my left.

427
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,794
But there's too many militia.

428
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,391
If I go closer, they might shoot me.

429
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:38,196
Now he's saying the building's
actually a couple blocks down...

430
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,965
but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

431
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,839
I'll fucking shoot him myself
a couple blocks down.

432
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,435
Tell him I want his skinny ass
parked in front of the damn building.

433
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,208
He's not getting paid
till he does exactly that.

434
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:53,978
It's three miles to the target area.
We're never off the main roads.

435
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:57,248
At the K-four traffic circle, we turn north,
then east on National...

436
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,518
and we wait until extraction of prisoners
is complete here.

437
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,559
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

438
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,391
we load the prisoners,
and then the assault-blocking forces...

439
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,828
and bring them back.

440
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,059
Home in an hour. Okay?

441
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,794
Now there will be some shooting.
Bakara Market is the Wild West.

442
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,306
But be careful what you shoot at
because people do live there.

443
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,735
Hoo-ah.

444
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,002
Hoo-ah.

445
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:34,315
Last one of these guys shot himself in
the head playing Russian roulette in a bar.

446
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,732
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

447
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:54,006
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time?

448
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:59,208
- He sounds scared shitless.
- Good. That's always a good sign.

449
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,892
That's it. That's our signal.

450
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,295
All right.

451
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,267
All QRF out of the airspace.

452
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,097
All QRF out of the airspace.

453
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:30,377
All units, Irene. I say again, Irene.

454
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:42,922
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up
and ready. Star 41 up and ready.

455
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,188
Irene!

456
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,356
Copy, Irene.

457
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,328
Fucking Irene!

458
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,207
Come on.

459
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,118
Good luck, boys.

460
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,587
Be careful.

461
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,586
No one gets left behind.

462
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,428
What's wrong?

463
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:22,462
Nothing. He's just never done that before.

464
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,462
Aw, fuck!

465
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,235
Let's go.

466
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,273
Sergeant Struecker. Let's roll.

467
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,362
Grimesy!

468
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,547
Two minutes.

469
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,916
Two minutes.

470
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,590
Why are they burning tires?

471
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,266
Signals to the militia that we're coming!

472
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,830
Okay, 56, looks like there's some friendlies
on the ground.

473
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,901
Looks like I've got a tally
on the voice intercept.

474
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,583
One minute.

475
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,252
One minute.

476
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,957
What's that for?

477
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,560
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.

478
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,795
Touching base.

479
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,802
Two feet, one foot...

480
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,364
clear.

481
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,040
Little birds touching down at target.

482
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,322
Ropes!

483
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:32,057
Go! Go! Go!

484
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,544
Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.

485
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,281
This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.

486
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,393
Down! Get down!

487
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,692
Down! Stay down!

488
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,628
Get down! Everybody down!

489
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,032
You, down!

490
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,359
Get down!

491
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:07,665
On the floor.

492
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:19,010
Captain Steele,
tell your men to stop firing at us.

493
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:23,920
26, this is 64. Cease fire.
You're firing at Delta.

494
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,353
I repeat, cease fire. Over.

495
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,420
You stay close to that ammo, Grimesy.

496
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,363
Is this normal enemy fire?

497
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,527
No, no,
this is 10 times worse than I've ever seen it.

498
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,036
Let's go, let's go!

499
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,565
Grimesy! No fear!

500
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,600
Oh, yeah, right!

501
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:53,147
Rangers securing perimeter. Four corners.

502
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,211
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

503
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,544
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

504
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,220
Well, shoot back!

505
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,258
This is 64. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

506
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,354
Roger that.

507
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,991
This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.

508
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:14,401
Super 62, take up an overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.

509
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,668
This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

510
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,739
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!

511
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:28,679
Go, Blackburn!

512
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,115
RPG!

513
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,650
Hold on!

514
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,221
No!

515
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,468
C-2, we got a man fallen.

516
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:54,242
- Super-61, you're a sitting duck there.
- Blackburn!

517
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,508
Take up overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.

518
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,546
Roger that. 61 coming out.

519
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:05,519
13, go ahead. I need you to move to
the north of the street.

520
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,247
Right to the north.
Right there. Right there. Over.

521
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,423
Doc! Doc Schmid!

522
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:12,990
Come on!

523
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,354
Schmid, we got a man hit.

524
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,870
- Where's he hit?
- He's not. He fell.

525
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,462
- What?
- He fell.

526
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,940
Why aren't you shooting?

527
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,045
We're not being shot at yet!

528
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,512
How can you tell?

529
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,377
A hiss means it's close.

530
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,883
A snap means...

531
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,915
Now they're shooting at us!

532
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,724
Galentine!

533
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:53,328
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!

534
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:57,036
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25. Come in. Over.

535
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,937
Blackburn, can you hear me?

536
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,977
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.

537
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,877
I can't get him!

538
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:08,610
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!

539
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:10,676
We need to get him out of here! Over.

540
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:13,848
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.

541
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,651
We've got a man down! Over.

542
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:21,892
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.

543
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,062
- Man down!
- Missed that, 25.

544
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,830
- Fuck it.
- Say again.

545
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,134
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!

546
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,639
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.

547
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:32,697
Okay.

548
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,403
What did he say?

549
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:38,312
Super 61,
we got a man wounded on the ground.

550
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,811
- Stretcher!
- Get me a stretcher!

551
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,983
Come on. Stretcher.

552
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,552
Come on, come on!

553
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,887
Grab this end!

554
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:50,788
Let's go!

555
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:53,758
- All right.
- Go.

556
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,732
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.

557
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,597
Up to the humvees! Now!

558
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,764
Go! Go!

559
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,134
Keep moving, Grimes! Run!

560
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,946
- Secure!
- Let's move out!

561
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,077
Everybody up! Let's go!

562
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:18,718
Come on!

563
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,313
Let's go! Let's move!

564
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,695
- Grimes, run!
- All right.

565
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:32,197
C-2, this is Super 61,
beginning my orbit of the target area.

566
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,258
Roger that.

567
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:36,135
Chalk Four, clear for a clear. Coming in.

568
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:42,043
Kilo 11, this is 61,
providing cover for prisoner extract. Over.

569
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,807
Kilo 64, green light.

570
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:48,177
- Ready for extraction. Over.
- Roger that, Kilo 11. Will relay.

571
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,151
That's it. We got them.

572
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,388
Uniform 64, ready for extraction. Over.

573
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,318
Roger that. There's the call. Let's move out!

574
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:58,417
- Let's move out!
- Hold on.

575
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,178
- How much longer?
- Five minutes, sir.

576
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:24,845
- What?
- Five minutes.

577
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:26,479
Nothing takes five minutes!

578
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,495
What happened to him?

579
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,088
- He fell! Missed the rope!
- How'd he do that?

580
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,695
Put him in that humvee!
Grimes, give him a hand!

581
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,101
Let's go! Let's move it!

582
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,198
Move, move! Come on! Move!

583
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,109
Get him in there!

584
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,669
Get ready to move!

585
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,039
Go! Everybody move! Move!

586
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:55,780
Get the fuck up!

587
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,484
Grimes! Come on!

588
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,853
Grimes! Grimes!

589
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,632
Fuck this!

590
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:34,982
Fuck!

591
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:39,787
Fuck!

592
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,026
Let's go.

593
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,627
Come on!

594
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,164
Go! Move it!

595
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,225
Move!

596
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:50,601
Romeo 64, I need to send out
three humvees with a critical casualty.

597
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,699
He looks real bad. I need to evac now.

598
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,437
Roger that, Uniform 64.

599
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,877
We'll chop a team of gun ships to you. Over.

600
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,141
Roger that.

601
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:01,343
Hey, Sanderson,
I need extra security on these humvees!

602
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:04,251
I'll go. I'll take my team,
make sure they get back okay.

603
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,481
Do it.

604
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,653
Struecker, you're lead humvee.

605
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:15,890
First three vehicles mount up,
we're moving back to base.

606
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,063
Move out!

607
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,644
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?

608
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,986
I don't want to talk about it now, Colonel!

609
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,183
I'm busy.

610
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,478
Sergeant Pilla's hit!

611
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,423
Christ, he's fucked up!

612
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,124
Is anyone hit?

613
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,255
Struecker, talk to me!

614
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,956
It's Sergeant Pilla!

615
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,925
What's his status?

616
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,123
What's his status?

617
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,133
He's dead.

618
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,332
He's dead.

619
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,133
Pilla's dead, sir.

620
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:38,244
C-2, this is McKnight.
We have a KIA Dominick Pilla. Over.

621
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,113
Roger that.

622
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,575
Get on that 50!

623
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,320
Someone get on that 50!

624
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,020
It's mine.

625
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,701
Three guys with RPGs,
coming up on your side now!

626
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,481
Stay with it!

627
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,909
This is 61. I'm hit. I'm hit.

628
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:53,917
Super 61 is hit. He is hit.
Wolcott's bird is hit.

629
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,853
You want to pull those PCLs off-line
or what?

630
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,461
Right, babe.

631
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:02,422
Come on.

632
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:10,703
61 going down.

633
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:12,136
61 going down.

634
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,733
61 is going down. She is going down.

635
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:18,880
- Super 61 is going down.
- 61 is going down.

636
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,916
Super 61 is going down.

637
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,078
61 is going down.
I repeat, Super 61 going down.

638
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,781
61 is going down.

639
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,653
Hold on!

640
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:55,780
We got a Black Hawk down.
We got a Black Hawk down.

641
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,750
Super 61 is down.
We got a bird down in the city.

642
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,024
Super 61 is on the deck now.

643
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,620
Get an MH-six on site. Check for survivors.

644
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,523
Send in the SAR bird.

645
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:11,590
I want ground forces to move and secure
a new perimeter around that crash site.

646
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,727
Can you guide the convoy in there?

647
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:14,929
Roger that.

648
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,335
Well, move quick.

649
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,908
The whole damn city
will be coming down on top of them.

650
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,344
Star 41, come inbound
and see if you can land at the crash site.

651
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,808
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.

652
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,256
We just lost the initiative.

653
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,003
25, this is 64. Over.

654
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:50,971
This is 25. Over.

655
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:54,873
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site.
Over.

656
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,569
64, I can't see the crash site. Over.

657
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:01,010
25, it's due east of you. You will find it.

658
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,809
Leave a security element in place.

659
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:05,116
Take the rest of your chalk on foot
to the crash.

660
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:08,555
Check for survivors. Secure the area.
All other chalks will follow. Over.

661
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,717
25, do you read me? Over.

662
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:13,888
Roger that.

663
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,863
Galentine! Schmid!

664
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:17,560
Go get Yurek.

665
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:18,896
Get Twombly.

666
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:21,667
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.

667
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,703
Twombly, Nelson, you're gonna stay here.

668
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,799
You're gonna hold this corner
and then exfil with the humvees.

669
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:30,334
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me.
All right? Let's go.

670
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:31,402
- Hoo-ah?
- Hoo-ah.

671
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,381
How come I got to stay back here?

672
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,849
Because you're dependable.

673
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,551
All right...

674
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:40,484
let's go!

675
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,695
I hate being dependable, man.

676
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:05,805
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing,
parallel west to your position.

677
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,043
Be advised,
women and children among them. Over.

678
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,584
Hit the wall.

679
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,502
Incoming!

680
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,404
Grenade!

681
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:51,651
Go.

682
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:04,932
We still got guys inside!

683
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,771
All right, all right,
I'm gonna go to the crash.

684
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:10,370
You take the rest of the team.
I'll finish loading the prisoners.

685
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:13,244
Negative! We're gonna proceed
to the crash site together.

686
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:15,546
Secure the perimeter,
wait for the humvees. Right, sir?

687
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:17,449
- Roger that.
- Follow my lead.

688
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:20,114
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?

689
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:22,851
Yeah, I heard you.
We should be leaving soon.

690
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,525
All right, we need to move out now!

691
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:30,828
I'll finish loading the prisoners
and pick you up at the crash site!

692
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,128
Let's move out!

693
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,725
Moving out! Go!

694
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,711
Get in! Get in!

695
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,174
Move!

696
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,151
Eight o'clock!

697
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,307
Hey, Grimes, stay away from the walls.

698
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,692
Hey, Grimes. You okay?

699
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,291
Yeah!

700
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,731
Let's go, Maddox.

701
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:40,726
- C-2, convoy's moving out.
- Roger that.

702
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,431
Maddox, look at these jerks! These idiots!

703
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,768
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!

704
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,209
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!

705
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,978
Hey, Twombly!

706
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:02,213
What?

707
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,486
- I think they've forgotten us.
- What?

708
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,593
It doesn't matter.

709
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,397
63, confirm. We've got Skinnies moving in
from all directions.

710
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,373
We need to get them help now.

711
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,276
Indigenous personnel
advancing to Wolcott crash site.

712
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:26,843
Say again. Over.

713
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,214
A lot of people closing in.

714
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,115
How far is Chalk Four from the crash site?

715
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,985
- Six blocks, sir.
- They need to haul ass.

716
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,076
Get down! Get down!

717
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,078
Scotty, are you okay?

718
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,387
No, don't go back!

719
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:51,323
Get down! Get down!

720
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:55,034
Technicals!

721
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:56,566
Got them!

722
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,743
Six o'clock! Move, move!

723
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,837
Come on. Get out of the way.

724
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:41,106
Go, go, go!

725
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:47,883
Go, go!

726
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,455
Come on!

727
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,565
Yurek, leaving!

728
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,103
Come on!

729
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:38,126
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.

730
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:42,367
Romeo 64, I need to know before I get to
the goddamn street!

731
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:45,332
You have to slow down. There's a delay.

732
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:50,170
From the time directions are relayed
from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

733
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,412
We can't slow down!
We're taking heavy enemy fire!

734
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,278
We can't slow down!

735
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:59,219
Danny, I'm getting information
from Orion surveillance above.

736
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,155
So get me my fucking directions to
the crash site!

737
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:06,251
Danny, hold on. I no longer have
the best view of your route.

738
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:09,123
Just get your ass in the right place,
God damn it!

739
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:12,326
What in the hell is the status
of Struecker's humvees?

740
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,334
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base,
Struecker's column.

741
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,764
ETA to base momentarily.

742
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:26,704
Open the gate!

743
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,998
- Get him out! Let's go! Let's go!
- Come on.

744
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,109
Watch his head.

745
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,542
Easy.

746
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:07,681
- Blackburn. Blackburn, you hear me?
- Get him to a medic.

747
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:45,453
Star 41 is at the crash site
to evacuate the injured. Over.

748
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:46,620
Roger that.

749
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,133
I got you.

750
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:28,897
Easy.

751
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:37,910
Galentine, you all right?

752
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:41,880
Galentine, Kurth, with me! Cover fire, now.

753
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,179
Full cover!

754
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:59,392
How many are in there?

755
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:02,369
Two pilots are dead,
the two crew chiefs are wounded!

756
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:04,565
This guy's hurt bad.
We gotta get out of here now.

757
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,107
All right. Go ahead.

758
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:42,540
26, 26, this is 25. Is that you
shooting up the technicals? Over.

759
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:44,637
This is 26. Roger that.

760
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:48,943
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner.
We're setting up a perimeter. Over.

761
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:51,713
This is 26. Roger that. Moving there now.
