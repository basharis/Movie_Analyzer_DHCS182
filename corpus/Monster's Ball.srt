{12174}{12289}What the hell|those niggers doing out there?
{12290}{12405}I said something to|you. Did you hear me?
{12406}{12439}Yeah.
{12440}{12499}Damn porch monkeys.
{12500}{12577}Be moving in here soon.
{12578}{12635}Sitting next to me.
{12636}{12724}Watching my TV.
{12740}{12830}There was a time|when they knew their place.
{12831}{12971}Wasn't none of this mixing going on.
{13076}{13229}Your mother, she hated|them niggers, too.
{13433}{13529}Tell them to get the|hell off my property.
{13530}{13588}- You put that thing down.|- We came by to see Sonny.
{13589}{13639}I don't give a damn|who you come by to see.
{13640}{13684}Get them out of here right now.
{13685}{13776}Tell them. They're your buddies.|Tell them to get out of here.
{13777}{13922}Well, what are you standing there for?
{14120}{14245}You watch your ass, all right?
{14388}{14467}We'll include a 11/2-pound bread machine|at no extra cost to you...
{14468}{14524}- You got everything you need?|- Yep.
{14525}{14590}...only while supplies|last, so stay tuned.
{14591}{14638}Now, let's join...
{14639}{14711}- Be careful walking around.|- Yeah, yeah.
{14712}{14777}...as he teaches us|the secrets of losing weight,
{14778}{14955}being young and fighting|disease with fresh juices.
{15115}{15187}You see these two boys here?
{15188}{15256}They're my sons.
{15257}{15291}They were on my property.
{15292}{15341}Ain't no need to be|scaring no little boys.
{15342}{15386}They ain't coming to hurt you.
{15387}{15479}Ain't no need to be letting off no shotgun|to tell them to leave, either.
{15480}{15531}You understand?
{15532}{15616}Well, then keep them off my property.
{15617}{15670}They're friends of your son, okay?
{15671}{15696}He invited them here.
{15697}{15773}They ain't trespassing,|they ain't hurting nobody.
{15774}{15911}Next time you wanna play cowboy,|I'm over here all the time.
{15912}{15972}- Well, you keep them off my property.|- I think you heard me, sir.
{15973}{16073}Yeah, well, I think you heard me, too.|All right?
{16074}{16184}Come on, boys. Let's go.
{16531}{16593}Shit.
{16660}{16707}- You all right, Dappa?|- Yeah, I'm all right.
{16708}{16756}- You sure?|- Yeah. It was loose.
{16757}{16819}Yeah?
{16840}{16903}Do you see what you did, Sonny?
{16904}{16963}Yeah, I'm sorry. It was my mistake.
{16964}{17052}- Yeah, it was.|- It won't happen next time.
{17053}{17223}Let's just keep going|till we get it right, huh?
{17347}{17433}That's none of your goddamn business.
{17434}{17499}No, I'm surprised|you talking like that to me,
{17500}{17531}you being a woman and all.
{17532}{17588}I'm a liberated woman.
{17589}{17615}Better watch out, Georgia Ann.
{17616}{17667}Tommy's gonna sue you|for sexual harassment.
{17668}{17771}Oh, that's all right.
{17815}{17893}Booter, how you doing?
{17894}{18058}- Just give me the $2.50, Sonny.|- I got it, Booter.
{18059}{18187}- You keep the rest of it.|- Thanks, Mr. Grotowski.
{18188}{18308}Just like I said, no more|mistakes, all right?
{18309}{18366}I wanna make damn sure|nobody makes any mistakes,
{18367}{18455}especially you.
{18476}{18676}So when it gets time for us to do it,|you know, you can't mess up.
{18677}{18802}That goes for me, too,|and the rest of them.
{18803}{18929}You ain't no different than us.|You can't screw it up.
{18930}{19019}- That's Hank's boy.|- You think it's in the genes?
{19020}{19090}Yeah, but he is a boy.
{19091}{19139}He will be a man tomorrow.
{19140}{19254}In England, they go as far|as to give the guy a party the night before.
{19255}{19385}They call it the Monster's Ball.
{19423}{19487}They don't want no lawyer, no preacher,|or anything like that around,
{19488}{19598}so it's just you and me.
{19623}{19671}Like I said,|we can't think about what he did
{19672}{19892}or anything else about him.|It's a job. We have to do our job right.
{21075}{21171}I've been drawing a lot. What about you?
{21172}{21235}Yeah.
{21257}{21379}Look here. We ain't got a lot of time.
{21380}{21513}I'm gonna give you all my drawings|and all my clothes.
{21514}{21659}When you get older, they may fit you,|and you may want to wear them.
{21660}{21763}- I'm not gonna see you again after this?|- No.
{21764}{21824}Why?
{21860}{21896}'Cause I'm a bad man.
{21897}{21947}Who says?
{21948}{22010}I do.
{22043}{22160}- But I want you to know something.|- What?
{22161}{22202}You ain't me.
{22203}{22319}- Yes, I am.|- No, you're not.
{22320}{22397}You're everything that's good about me.
{22398}{22489}You're the best of what I am,|that's what you are.
{22490}{22658}This man you see sitting here today,|you ain't.
{22723}{22795}Hey, baby. You look nice today.
{22796}{22899}You always look nice.
{22904}{22972}Tyrell, tell your daddy|what you won at school.
{22973}{23016}Oh, yeah, right.
{23017}{23097}My drawing is gonna be used|on the school magazine cover.
{23098}{23152}- You know what I did?|- What'd you do?
{23153}{23247}Go on. Just tell him.|Don't be playing no guessing game.
{23248}{23418}I made a picture of you,|sitting alone, in jail.
{23474}{23568}Theme was solitude.
{23569}{23683}Way to go, Ty. Way to|go. Put it there, boy.
{23684}{23764}Not too bad.
{23960}{24051}What's going on with the car?
{24052}{24121}It's leaking radiator fluid.
{24122}{24221}You need to take it in right away.|Have them check the hoses.
{24222}{24387}That car get too hot,|you gonna be in trouble.
{24452}{24515}The house?
{24516}{24566}I'm losing it.
{24567}{24672}I can't afford to make the payments|no more.
{24673}{24748}Not no more.
{24749}{24839}I'm sorry, baby.
{24948}{24995}Ty, let me and your|mama talk for a second.
{24996}{25058}Okay.
{25234}{25314}Come on now.
{25329}{25443}Only reason I'm here|so you could say goodbye to your son.
{25444}{25474}Okay.
{25475}{25601}I been coming here|for damn near 11 years, Lawrence,
{25602}{25664}and I'm tired.

{26469}{26569}Come on now.|Come on, Ty, you gotta let go. Come on.
{26570}{26660}Come on, Tyrell.
{26703}{26796}For every time I hurt you, I'm sorry.
{26797}{26867}Come on.
{26883}{26938}Ma'am, let's go.
{26939}{27008}Let's go.
{27009}{27071}Ma'am, let's go.
{27072}{27229}I know my way out of|here. Come on, Tyrell.
{27464}{27517}Well, he don't have|any outstanding appeals,
{27518}{27638}so, looks like|we're definitely going to do it tonight.
{27639}{27674}Everybody okay?
{27675}{27791}- You all right, Georgia Ann?|- I'm okay.
{27792}{27888}- Dappa, is that hood ready?|- Yeah. Yeah, it's fixed and ready to go.
{27889}{27940}All right.
{27941}{28001}Anybody got anything to say?
{28002}{28123}- Tommy.|- He likes to draw. It calms him down.
{28124}{28201}Draw. Okay.
{28203}{28279}Phil, will you make sure he's got|whatever it is he needs to draw with?
{28280}{28353}Yes, sir.
{28357}{28439}All right.|Tommy, why don't you lead us in a prayer?
{28440}{28503}Okay.
{28576}{28658}Open cell 13!
{28736}{28782}I'm here for your stuff, man.
{28783}{28879}"Now know I that the Lord|saveth his anointed.
{28880}{29115}"He will hear him in his holy heaven|with the saving strength of his right hand."
{29116}{29203}- Be careful with this.|- Don't worry about it, man.
{29204}{29277}Close 13!
{29316}{29363}Worry's all I got.
{29364}{29445}"...trust in chariots, some in horses,
{29446}{29531}"but we will remember|the name of the Lord our God.
{29532}{29646}"They are brought down and fallen,|but we are risen and stand upright.
{29647}{29727}"Save, Lord, let the king|hear us when we call."
{29728}{29831}Sky surfing is when you skydive|with a board attached to your feet
{29832}{29875}and try to do different maneuvers.
{29876}{29937}A camera flyer flies with a camera
{29938}{30004}on top of their helmet,|filming the sky surfer,
{30005}{30078}and flies interactively with the sky surfer,|capturing the moves.
{30079}{30239}My camera flyer|is my husband Craig O'Brien.
{30256}{30331}Now, I'm gonna put|these on nice and loose.
{30332}{30379}Everything gonna be okay, right?
{30380}{30453}Yes, sir.
{30574}{30649}What about my last phone call?
{30650}{30752}Warden says it's a bad idea.
{30753}{30833}Turn around.
{30909}{31011}Think maybe he could call my son|and tell him that I tried?
{31012}{31078}I don't think so.
{31079}{31142}Okay.
{31176}{31246}Open 13!
{31535}{31590}Our free fall is usually|around 60 seconds,
{31591}{31720}and the normal altitude that|we jump from is 12,500 feet.
{31721}{31794}Let's go.
{31863}{31936}Close 13!
{32104}{32210}...starting to feel a little cramped|by your present surroundings?
{32211}{32269}Maybe it's time to expand your horizons.
{32270}{32330}Maybe it's time to think about Re/Max.
{32331}{32406}Re/Max and associates lead|the real estate industry...
{32407}{32490}I'm gonna be right|back. Stay right there.
{32491}{32569}Re/Max can help you find a new home|that meets all your needs.
{32570}{32668}While selling your current house to|someone who'll find it absolutely perfect...
{32669}{32728}If you're looking for results,|look for Re/Max.
{32729}{32854}Nobody sells more real estate.
{33369}{33492}Where's my paper and pencil?|It's my right to have my paper and pencil.
{33493}{33525}I know it.
{33526}{33578}Your paper and pencil's on the way.
{33579}{33677}I promise you this.
{34075}{34135}Hey.
{34621}{34696}Thank you.
{34714}{34801}You're welcome.
{36225}{36330}Here you go, Lawrence.
{36365}{36447}Is that done?
{36503}{36578}Let's see.
{36588}{36721}Wow. That's nice. That's real nice.
{36722}{36814}I don't look this good in person.
{36815}{36917}- Thank you.|- You're welcome.
{36918}{37006}You're welcome.
{37119}{37180}You all right, Lawrence?
{37181}{37239}Sonny.
{37240}{37360}- Just you breathe.|- Sonny.
{37389}{37434}Sonny, sit down.
{37435}{37515}Sonny, I said sit down.
{37516}{37589}Sit down.
{37590}{37660}Come on.
{37763}{37819}Come on, Lawrence.|Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.
{37820}{37919}Let's go. It's all right.|It's all right. Just let go. Let go.
{37920}{38093}Let go. It's all right.|Let go. Come on. Come on.
{38346}{38446}I've always believed that a portrait
{38447}{38503}captures a person
{38504}{38627}far better than a photograph.
{38688}{38881}It truly takes a human being|to really see a human being.
{39231}{39273}Wait a minute.
{39274}{39349}Come here.
{39574}{39647}What the hell is this, Tyrell?
{39648}{39709}What'd I tell you|about eating this shit?
{39710}{39759}Didn't I tell you don't|be eating that shit?
{39760}{39819}Look at this! Look at all this fat!
{39820}{39867}This fat, fat ass!
{39868}{39983}Look at all this nasty|fat! Where they at?
{39984}{40025}Look at all this candy.
{40026}{40090}You ain't gonna eat all this candy!|You crazy?
{40091}{40145}Look at this room. It's a mess.
{40146}{40179}Why is it a mess, Tyrell?
{40180}{40255}'Cause a fat little|piggy lives in this room!
{40256}{40308}Get your fat ass on this scale.
{40309}{40389}Get on the scale!|What does it say? What's it say?
{40390}{40472}- 189.|- 189.
{40478}{40590}You ain't lost no weight!
{40764}{40879}Come on. Come on. Come on.
{40883}{41025}Let's go wait for your daddy to call.
{43066}{43099}It is ordered and adjudged
{43100}{43140}that the judgment|pronounced and set forth
{43141}{43201}in this order sentencing|the defendant to death
{43202}{43282}in the manner and by the authorities|as provided by statute

{45239}{45434}Lawrence Musgrove, do you have anything|you'd like to say?
{45553}{45643}Push the button.
{47397}{47503}Hey. You know what you did?|Do you know what you did?
{47504}{47600}Are you listening to me?|Do you know what you did?
{47601}{47679}Do you know what you did?|You fucked him up!
{47680}{47725}You fucked up that man's last walk!
{47726}{47797}How would you like it|if somebody fucked up your last walk?
{47798}{47907}You're like a goddamn woman.|You're like your fucking mother!
{47908}{47970}You shouldn't have done that,|you son of a bitch!
{47971}{48034}Get up, you fucking pussy! Come here!
{48035}{48137}You are a piece of fucking shit!|Do you understand me?
{48138}{48177}Hey, hey! Hold on, hold on.

{51452}{51532}You hate me?
{51725}{51800}Answer me.
{51858}{51922}You hate me, don't you?
{51923}{52015}Yeah, I hate you.
{52046}{52126}I always did.
{52127}{52240}Well, I always loved you.
{52425}{52530}Give me them scissors.
{52976}{53038}Here.
{53258}{53307}Hold up, wait a minute.
{53308}{53463}- Where you going?|- I wanna put these up.
{55558}{55685}- How much?|- That'll be $2.85.
{56110}{56164}Hey, Billy. Moving as|fast as I can, man.

{56224}{56281}- You don't need to get dressed.|- Damn car's still acting up.
{56282}{56324}Leticia, listen. It's not just your car.
{56325}{56355}You've been late every day this week.
{56356}{56399}Billy, I've been trying to get here.
{56400}{56455}I need this money.|I'm gonna lose my house.
{56456}{56539}Look, why don't you go home, relax,|take some time off, you know?
{56540}{56581}You shouldn't be here right now, anyway.
{56582}{56659}I know that. That's why|you should've had gave me the week off.
{56660}{56706}With some pay.
{56707}{56857}Hell, Leticia, I already got a new girl.

{57508}{57681}All I want to hear|is that dirt hitting that box.
{57726}{57806}He was weak.
{57931}{57961}You can say a little something, though,
{57962}{58117}if you want to, once|we've covered him up.
{59972}{60011}- How you doing?|- All right.
{60012}{60127}- You want to see a menu?|- No, that's all right. I know what I want.

{60479}{60602}- That's it. Yeah.|- That it?
{60876}{60938}Hey, Vera, it's Hank.
{60939}{61026}Is it too late?
{61037}{61151}Okay, chocolate ice cream. Here you go.
{61152}{61255}I'm gonna... I'm gonna need|a plastic spoon for the ice cream.
{61256}{61317}Oh! Goddamn!
{61318}{61365}I'm sorry about that.
{61366}{61459}- It's all right.|- Shit! I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry.
{61460}{61536}- Bring me some napkins or something.|- Okay. I'm sorry about that.
{61537}{61563}It's all right.
{61564}{61606}- And you said a what?|- Plastic spoon.
{61607}{61694}Okay, I'll get it.
{61695}{61872}- Where's Lucille?|- I'm trying to fill in for her.
{62176}{62303}- I'm ready to pay this.|- Yep.
{62501}{62687}- What's the deal there?|- I don't know. I just over-rang this thing.
{62688}{62715}If you can't get that thing open,
{62716}{62807}just tell me how much it is,|and I'll pay you for it.
{62808}{62873}$3.92.
{62898}{63006}There's $4.00. You keep the change.
{63007}{63060}Thanks.
{63061}{63153}Hey, cowboy.|Feel like some late-night pussy?
{63154}{63202}Guess so.
{63203}{63255}Haven't seen you in a while.
{63256}{63322}Yeah, well...
{63323}{63405}I ain't been feeling too good.
{63406}{63592}Busy, a lot of things.|This and that and the other, you know?
{63593}{63619}How you been?
{63620}{63720}- All right.|- Good.
{63849}{63939}So, how's Sonny?
{64078}{64132}I can't do this tonight, Vera.
{64133}{64258}- Are you sure, hon?|- No, not tonight. I'm sorry.
{64259}{64364}No need to be sorry.|Let's just do it some other time.
{64365}{64440}All right.
{64504}{64659}- You can keep that money.|- I'm going to.
{64668}{64733}Adios.
{67454}{67531}- Have a seat, Hank.|- Thank you, sir.
{67532}{67597}I appreciate you seeing me.
{67598}{67651}What brings you here, Hank?
{67652}{67721}Sir, I'm resigning.
{67722}{67916}And, I wanted to come by|and tell you personally, you know?
{67917}{68027}I appreciate that, Hank.
{68064}{68160}Why don't we wait a few weeks|before we submit the paperwork?
{68161}{68219}That wouldn't do anybody any good|to wait on that, though.
{68220}{68318}I've got my mind made up.
{68319}{68389}All right.
{68390}{68492}We're gonna miss you.
{68593}{68711}I brought my badge in and...
{68712}{68769}Why don't you keep it?
{68770}{68885}I ain't got no use for it.
{69496}{69594}There you are, Pop.
{69691}{69798}We got each other, Son.
{69825}{69945}- Remember that.|- Yes, sir.
{70120}{70210}I quit the team.
{70479}{70576}That was a mistake.
{70708}{70813}I can't do it anymore.
{70831}{70969}You're reminding me of your mother.
{70996}{71102}I guess that's bad, right?
{71103}{71191}Your mother wasn't shit.
{71192}{71294}That woman failed me.
{71362}{71484}I got more pussy after|she killed herself
{71485}{71640}than I did when she|was living as my wife.
{71702}{71829}The point is... she quit on me.
{71854}{71959}You're doing the same.
{72004}{72084}God damn it!
{72100}{72184}Let's go. Hand me my purse.
{72185}{72224}Come on. Get out.
{72225}{72373}- Mama, what's wrong?|- We got to walk.
{72876}{72947}Boy, get out that street!
{72948}{73000}Get yourself killed. Get over here.
{73001}{73124}Don't do that. Don't do that.
{73143}{73197}Oh, this?|I'm telling you, this is a jim-dandy.
{73198}{73233}This is just what I'm looking for.
{73234}{73260}And at the same time,
{73261}{73327}it's the most expensive one|I've come across, you know?
{73328}{73407}But if you're willing to|talk on price under...
{73408}{73451}- We put quite a bit of work in it.|- I bet you did.
{73452}{73501}We can talk about it.
{73502}{73550}You know what?|Let me think it over. You got my number.
{73551}{73594}- Sure, I got yours.|- All right.
{73595}{73631}- It was a pleasure.|- Sure.
{73632}{73667}- Nice seeing you.|- I'll be talking to you.
{73668}{73788}- You, too.|- Okay, see you.
{74018}{74121}Come on, T. Let's go.
{74148}{74186}That's what you think|your mama look like?
{74187}{74222}Yeah, sort of.
{74223}{74266}- See you tomorrow morning?|- Yeah, see you.
{74267}{74294}You, too, young man.
{74295}{74387}- Bye.|- Bye-bye.
{75085}{75201}Come on, T! Come on! Get up!
{75202}{75299}Come on, T! Get up!
{75341}{75413}Help me! Wait!
{75414}{75476}Wait!
{75503}{75556}Come back here!
{75557}{75627}Help us!
{75657}{75715}Come help us!
{75716}{75786}Help us!
{76110}{76206}T, wake up, baby. Wake up.
{76207}{76260}He was hit... He was hit by a car.
{76261}{76291}Calm down. Calm down.
{76292}{76348}We gotta get him to|a hospital right now!
{76349}{76424}Right now!
{77145}{77183}Hey, y'all,|we're gonna need a gurney out here.
{77184}{77246}- There's a kid. I think it's pretty bad.|- Gurney!
{77247}{77397}We're gonna, we're gonna need some help.
{77518}{77559}Are you the boy's mother?
{77560}{77655}Please, follow me.
{77660}{77734}Is that your boy?
{77735}{77766}- No.|- No?
{77767}{77841}What happened to him?
{77842}{77883}I think he got hit by a car.
{77884}{77927}That was his mother, went through there.
{77928}{77996}- She said he was hit by a car.|- Hit and run?
{77997}{78047}Like I said, I don't|know. I picked them up...
{78048}{78135}Listen, I need to file a police report|if it was a hit and run.
{78136}{78172}Well, shit, I don't|even know the people.
{78173}{78199}I wouldn't know what to write.
{78200}{78234}I wouldn't know the|first thing about it.
{78235}{78302}Just stay, tell the police what you did,|what you saw.
{78303}{78443}It'll take you 5 minutes. I promise.
{78787}{78879}Wait! Wait! Wait!
{79092}{79179}That's my baby!
{79188}{79275}That's my baby!
{79282}{79336}I know you're not supposed|to move people and everything,
{79337}{79399}but, shit, I didn't|know what else to do.
{79400}{79551}I mean, the boy was laying there,|and the woman was hysterical.
{79552}{79579}I just did the best I could do.
{79580}{79621}I just thought I'd better|lug him in the car
{79622}{79686}and get on to here as quick as I could,|so that's what I did.
{79687}{79770}All right. Well, you did a good job.
{79771}{79867}- So you were just passing by?|- Yeah, I was just passing by.
{79868}{79962}I don't know that lady at all.
{79963}{80027}I'm gonna give you my card.
{80028}{80062}We're gonna do a follow-up...
{80063}{80111}If we get anything, okay?
{80112}{80163}And we might call you as well|if we need to.
{80164}{80204}- That's all right.|- That'd be all right?
{80205}{80271}- Whatever you need me to do.|- I got your number right there.
{80272}{80347}All right.
{80382}{80464}Is that it? Can I go?
{80465}{80548}Yeah. Thanks.
{80635}{80702}That boy make it all right?
{80703}{80783}No. He died.
{81425}{81502}Mrs. Musgrove,|I'm gonna give you my card,
{81503}{81537}and you feel free to call me
{81538}{81631}anytime that you can remember|anything about this, okay?
{81632}{81666}And I am so sorry.
{81667}{81775}Ma'am, could you get me something|to clean that off?
{81776}{81893}That's my... That's my bag.
{81930}{81999}Let me go.
{82000}{82092}- Here's your purse.|- He gone. My baby.

{82148}{82240}He gone. He gone.
{82316}{82411}You gonna take her home, ain't you?
{82412}{82504}I don't really know her.
{82505}{82574}- I'll take her home.|- I think that's a good idea.
{82575}{82675}Yeah, I'll take her.
{82817}{82887}Could you do me a favor|and throw that away for me?
{82888}{82926}- Yes, sir.|- I'd appreciate that.
{82927}{83019}Take care, ma'am.
{83343}{83455}Now, where do you live, hon?
{83456}{83587}Ma'am, you're gonna have to tell me|where you live.
{83588}{83656}Now, I'm gonna go in your purse.|I'm just letting you know.
{83657}{83877}I'm going in your purse|to try to find an address on you, all right?
{84670}{84716}You probably ought to call|some of your kin people
{84717}{84857}or one of your friends or something.
{84964}{85034}I'm gonna have to go.
{85035}{85098}You gonna be all right?
{85099}{85247}Police told me to call the coroner's office|in the morning.
{85248}{85299}I'm sorry?
{85300}{85374}They told me to call|the coroner's office.
{85375}{85475}Said they gonna do an autopsy.
{85476}{85575}I don't know|why they gonna do an autopsy.
{85576}{85676}He was hit by a car.
{85770}{85872}Well, I imagine it'll help them find out|who did it.
{85873}{85957}You really believe they gonna do that?
{85958}{86059}I believe they'll try their best, I do.
{86060}{86227}He's a black kid.|You think they gonna do that?
{86368}{86565}Here's your bag.|I'm just gonna leave it on the floor here.
{86625}{86713}I'm real sorry.
{87829}{87875}Mr. Grotowski?
{87876}{87977}Just wanted to say sorry about Sonny.|We liked him a lot.

{88192}{88317}This is Willie. That's Darryl.
{88339}{88469}I'll see you. I appreciate that.
{88759}{88893}I'm going over to the cafe.|Do you want me to give you a ride?
{88894}{88951}Sure you don't mind?
{88952}{89069}I'm going that way, anyway.
{89344}{89437}Is this music all right with you?
{89438}{89569}- 'Cause I can change it.|- No, it's cool.
{89570}{89635}You ain't got a car?
{89636}{89687}It's broke.
{89688}{89821}I'm saving to get me another one.
{90028}{90105}$8.64. Thank you.

{90225}{90292}Thanks.
{90342}{90417}Thank you.
{91128}{91182}Hey, Pop.
{91183}{91272}- Lookie here.|- What are those for?
{91273}{91359}I bought a gas station.
{91360}{91438}That right?
{91487}{91637}It's all bought and paid for. We own it.
{91645}{91703}Don't say "we."
{91704}{91764}You own it.
{91765}{91849}I didn't buy it.
{91850}{91890}Yeah, well...
{91891}{91976}I wouldn't have bought no gas station.
{91977}{92062}Is that right?
{92107}{92177}I would've stuck to what I knew best.
{92178}{92305}- What's that?|- Corrections Officer.
{92306}{92357}Right.
{92358}{92496}Well, I ain't a Corrections Officer no more.|I'm a gas station owner.
{92497}{92573}I already made the deal.|It's too late, Pop.
{92574}{92651}- You want me to fix you something?|- No.
{92652}{92737}Suit yourself.
{92799}{92859}Hey.
{93308}{93390}There you go.
{93392}{93453}How you doing?
{93454}{93502}I'm all right.
{93503}{93546}Tired.
{93547}{93645}- You gonna eat something?|- Chocolate ice cream.
{93646}{93731}Plastic spoon.
{93739}{93816}You got it.
{93873}{93948}Thank you.
{93988}{94068}Are you set?
{94076}{94186}About time for you to get off, isn't it?
{94187}{94275}Did you want me to give you a ride?
{94276}{94371}No. I...|I wouldn't think to ask you to do that.
{94372}{94490}It's right on the way home.
{94545}{94653}- Sure you don't mind?|- No, I'd be happy to.
{94654}{94716}Okay.
{94753}{94831}- The one on Prospect Street.|- Clement's?
{94832}{94890}- Yeah, Clement's.|- You bought Clement's?
{94891}{94931}Yeah.
{94932}{95018}I know Clement. Can't stand that man.
{95019}{95075}Well, he ain't gonna|be running it. I am.
{95076}{95131}Well, that's good.
{95132}{95197}Thanks for the ride.
{95198}{95311}Can I ask you a question?
{95348}{95443}Why did you help me?
{95444}{95477}What do you mean?
{95478}{95535}When you took me and my baby|to the hospital,
{95536}{95631}why'd you do that?
{95734}{95802}I don't know. I guess...
{95803}{95876}I just...
{95900}{96053}You know, doing the|right thing, I guess.
{96162}{96242}My son died.
{96288}{96353}And...
{96404}{96459}Well, he...
{96460}{96560}He died, and then...
{96583}{96710}I never was a very good father.
{96796}{96891}He was a good kid.
{96954}{97075}I guess that somehow I just...
{97076}{97128}When I seen|what you're going through there,
{97129}{97183}it made me think about something,
{97184}{97307}or it reminded me of something,|I don't know.
{97308}{97473}You know when you feel|like you can't breathe?
{97653}{97764}And, you can't get out to...
{97765}{97813}From inside yourself, you know?
{97814}{97881}Really.
{98055}{98172}Do you want to come inside?
{98218}{98323}I like these curtains.
{98352}{98434}I got these here curtains on credit.
{98435}{98592}I never heard of anybody getting curtains|on credit before, that I know of.
{98593}{98672}What you think? They|cute. Ain't they cute?
{98673}{98739}I love these curtains.
{98740}{98799}They're good and red, all right.
{98800}{98851}I got...
{98852}{98968}I got these curtains|right here on credit,
{98969}{99042}and the man told me
{99043}{99101}that I really|wasn't supposed to get this deal.
{99102}{99141}But I think he kind of liked me,
{99142}{99231}and he told me I could have these curtains|on credit.
{99232}{99271}I said, "Hey, what the hell?
{99272}{99326}"Some red curtains|would be great for my place."
{99327}{99429}So I said, "Hey, I'll take it."|So I got me some red curtains.
{99430}{99537}Damn straight, huh? Just...
{99538}{99597}Boy, you sure suck that whiskey down,|don't you?
{99598}{99713}I mean... Lord have mercy.
{99726}{99807}My husband used to love him
{99808}{99903}some Jack Daniels.
{99909}{100072}Well, like I said, it's...|Yeah, it's a good drink.
{100073}{100121}You wait right here.|I'm gonna show you something.
{100122}{100185}Okay.
{100208}{100295}Sit right here.
{100446}{100499}What you got there, some kind of a,
{100500}{100559}some kind of an annual,|a school annual or something?
{100560}{100601}No. These...
{100602}{100717}These pictures right here.
{100724}{100855}These are my husband's drawings|right here.
{100856}{100887}Lawrence.
{100888}{101003}My husband, he drew those.
{101083}{101230}He got himself electrocuted|over there in Jackson.
{101231}{101323}He got himself...
{101380}{101540}These right here, these|are my son Tyrell's.
{101550}{101602}He drew these.
{101603}{101757}- He drew all of these right here.|- Yeah.
{101758}{101842}Got his talent from the old man, then,|I guess.
{101843}{101871}Didn't he?
{101872}{101935}That's the only thing|that Negro ever gave that boy,
{101936}{101982}was some drawing.
{101983}{102037}Taught him how to draw.
{102038}{102116}- It runs in families, things like that.|- Yeah.
{102117}{102209}You know, he's...
{102230}{102330}He was a good kid, you know?|He was a really good kid.
{102331}{102380}He was so good.
{102381}{102491}He was... He really loved me.
{102492}{102634}- He really loved me.|- I understand.
{102656}{102741}He was so fat.
{102746}{102856}He was so fat, he wouldn't...
{102857}{102943}I don't care what I brought in this house,|he'd just eat it up.
{102944}{102995}I don't care what it|was I brought in here.
{102996}{103039}I bring some Popeyes Chicken,
{103040}{103097}that boy eat the whole thing|before I even get a chance
{103098}{103128}to get me a bite of the chicken...
{103129}{103246}He'd just eat it up! He|would eat his ass off!
{103247}{103372}You ain't never seen nobody eat like...
{103373}{103455}He would eat candy and gumballs.
{103456}{103513}He made me take him over up there|to the super Kmart...
{103514}{103539}Yeah?
{103540}{103594}...and he put them quarters|in that gumball machine.
{103595}{103627}Yeah.
{103628}{103718}He had to wait till he get the red gumball.|He had...
{103719}{103842}He always had to get the red gumball.
{103843}{103963}He sounds like a character, I guess.

{127888}{128062}Hank must've done something right|to deserve a fine hat like this.
{128063}{128098}Guess he did.
{128099}{128263}In my prime,|I had a thing for nigger juice myself.
{128264}{128337}Hank just like his daddy.

{136752}{136927}I about got the money.|I'm just still saving it...
{138402}{138486}I painted the ceiling and the wall|and just fixed it up a little bit.
{138487}{138579}I figured that I ought to.
{138580}{138699}I'll move your stuff in,|so you don't have to worry with it.
{138700}{138736}So...
{138737}{138806}You know, I'm going to go into the kitchen|and get a thing or two,

{141472}{141543}I don't mind sleeping across the hall there|if you want me to.
{141544}{141600}I mean,|maybe you should sleep by yourself.
{141601}{141740}No. I wouldn't feel good|if you left me in here all by myself.
{141741}{141869}I just want you to be|comfortable in here.
{141870}{142005}I want you to be comfortable, too.
