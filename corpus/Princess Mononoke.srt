{368}{503}In ancient times the land|lay covered in forest...
{505}{659}...where from ages long past|dwelt the spirits of the gods.
{1693}{1803}PRINCESS MONONOKE
{2137}{2161}Yakul!
{2317}{2340}Ashitaka!
{2361}{2432}Oracle says to get back to the village.
{2433}{2478}The Old Man, too.
{2481}{2543}- He says something's wrong.|- No birds.
{2545}{2568}No animals...
{2571}{2683}I'll go to him. You get back home.
{3591}{3641}Something's coming!
{3804}{3837}What is it?
{3839}{3898}It's not a person...
{3899}{3977}Oracle's called everyone in.
{3994}{4028}There!
{4726}{4779}A demon god!
{5278}{5312}Yakul, run!
{5928}{5991}It'll attack the village!
{5994}{6034}Ashitaka!
{6037}{6119}Don't touch it!|Its curse will be on you!
{6141}{6173}Yakul!
{6732}{6780}Quiet your rage, I beg you!
{6782}{6897}O forest god who cannot be|without name, why do you rampage so?
{7294}{7352}- A monster!|- Run!
{7390}{7461}Stop! Do not destroy our village!
{7463}{7509}Stop! Still your rage!
{7618}{7645}Get up!
{8973}{9036}- It's down!|- Ashitaka!
{9038}{9065}Bring Oracle!
{9067}{9096}Watch the fire!
{9136}{9163}Ashitaka!
{9239}{9310}Don't touch it! It's no ordinary wound!
{9311}{9383}He's hurt! Where's Oracle?!
{9386}{9449}All of you, stay back!
{9462}{9489}Oracle!
{9490}{9572}Pour this water over it...slowly.
{9907}{9990}O raging god unknown to us...
{9992}{10060}...l bow before you.
{10086}{10196}Where you have fallen we will|raise a mound and perform rites.
{10198}{10265}Bear us no hate, and be at peace.
{10304}{10382}You loathsome rabble!
{10407}{10501}You shall know my hatred|and my grief!.
{11440}{11522}This is very, very bad.
{11523}{11618}The boar-spirit came from|far to the west.
{11619}{11718}A poison within him goaded him on,|rotting his flesh...
{11719}{11863}...drawing evil as he ran,|making a monster of him.
{11890}{11918}Prince Ashitaka...
{11952}{12008}Show your right arm.
{12212}{12235}Oracle!
{12268}{12387}Prince Ashitaka, are you steeled|to gaze upon your fate?
{12389}{12476}Yes. I was resolved|when I let my arrow fly.
{12532}{12633}The scar will seep into your bones|and you will die.
{12748}{12800}Can nothing be done?!
{12802}{12883}He was defending the girls,|and the village!
{12885}{12937}Can we but sit and wait?
{12956}{13017}You cannot change your fate.
{13019}{13125}You can, though, rise to meet it.
{13127}{13163}Look.
{13211}{13283}This was inside the boar's body.
{13299}{13429}He was in agony. It shattered|his bones, tore at his entrails...
{13431}{13523}What else could|have made him that way?
{13540}{13642}Calamity has befallen|the land of the west.
{13644}{13755}Journey there, and see|with eyes unclouded.
{13769}{13860}There might be a way|to lift the curse.
{13913}{14076}More than 500 years have gone since|the Mikado drove us into this land.
{14077}{14168}Now we hear how his power fades...
{14169}{14260}...and the fangs of his Shoguns|are broken.
{14261}{14373}But the blood of our tribe|likewise grows thin.
{14386}{14508}And now, bitter fate...|the youth who was one day to lead us...
{14510}{14587}...must journey far to the west.
{14965}{15072}The law forbids that we watch|as you go. Farewell.
{15793}{15819}Brother!
{15821}{15873}Kaya, you can't be here!
{15889}{15981}I don't care. Remember me by this.
{16097}{16143}But it's your jeweled dagger!
{16161}{16217}Keep it with you to guard you.
{16219}{16328}I'll think of you...|be sure of that.
{16331}{16408}As will l, Kaya.
{18556}{18586}Fighting?
{18795}{18820}Move up!
{18896}{18935}A warrior!
{18938}{18985}His head is mine!
{19240}{19269}Stop!
{19466}{19506}My arm!
{19535}{19593}Don't let him get away!
{19597}{19655}Let me pass!
{20014}{20049}A demon!
{20368}{20413}The scar's growing...
{20686}{20751}This gruel tastes like hot water!
{20851}{20899}There he is!
{21054}{21085}Will this do?
{21086}{21137}This isn't money!
{21154}{21194}Give back my rice!
{21208}{21268}Could I see that, please?
{21291}{21321}Hm?!
{21323}{21422}Woman, this is pure gold!
{21454}{21529}Is it coins you want? I'll pay you.
{21531}{21561}Give me this.
{21577}{21665}Is there a money-changer here?
{21666}{21717}No?
{21727}{21859}I'm just a simple priest, but I'd say|this is worth three sacks of rice!
{21861}{21890}Wait, young sir!
{21892}{21933}That's mine! Give it back!
{21954}{22037}Hey! Don't be in such a rush!
{22054}{22191}No need to thank me.|It's I who should thank you.
{22193}{22292}I saw what you did before|against those samurai.
{22314}{22405}You fight like one possessed!
{22490}{22584}Ah, you see those men, too?|Keep your gold hidden, my lad.
{22601}{22675}Hearts have grown hard|throughout the land.
{22696}{22782}They'll rob you in your sleep.|Shall we run?
{23033}{23111}So the boar became a monster...
{23127}{23249}I tracked it back to where|the samurai attacked the village, but...
{23251}{23286}You lost it.
{23288}{23328}See over there?
{23346}{23484}When I was last this way,|there was a fine village here.
{23487}{23591}There was a flood, maybe,|or a landslide. I'm sure many died.
{23631}{23720}The land teems with the twittering|of bitter ghosts...
{23722}{23828}...dead from war, sick or starved|and fallen where they stood...
{23830}{23931}A curse, you say?|This world is a curse.
{23992}{24031}Ah, this is good!
{24073}{24168}I shouldn't have gotten into|that fight. I killed two men.
{24169}{24235}You saved me that task.
{24236}{24306}Give me your bowl.
{24308}{24339}We all die.
{24354}{24405}Some now, some later.
{24407}{24471}Hm, an elegant bowl...
{24472}{24579}You remind me of the old tales...
{24598}{24665}A brave people, far to the east...
{24667}{24752}...who used stone arrowheads|and rode red elk...the Emishi.
{24911}{24991}First, though,|avoid the jaws of death.
{24992}{25069}Or so my old teacher used to say.
{25071}{25129}Eat, my lad. It's your rice!
{25182}{25229}Would you know what this is?
{25337}{25361}No.
{25375}{25504}It was in the body of the giant boar.|It's what killed him.
{25743}{25819}Far to the west...
{25821}{25919}...deep in the mountains,|is the forest of the Deer God.
{25920}{25959}There no man may tread.
{25961}{25998}The forest of the Deer God?
{26000}{26119}They say the beasts there are giants,|as they were in ages past.
{26936}{26981}I knew he'd go...
{27744}{27831}It's not far now!|Stay on your guard!
{27859}{27892}Here they come!
{27895}{27924}The wolves!
{28108}{28190}Calm the oxen! Don't rush!|Form your ranks!
{28193}{28239}Keep your powder dry!
{28255}{28299}Let them come in range!
{28480}{28532}Number 1 , fire!
{28952}{29004}Number 2, fire!
{29153}{29218}They weren't much, as monsters go.
{29220}{29295}Those were just the pups.|Where's the mother?
{29464}{29491}It's Moro!
{29643}{29680}Come on!
{30007}{30042}Got her!
{30044}{30124}She's a god.|She won't die from that.
{30315}{30359}She did some damage...
{30360}{30395}Move them out.
{30396}{30439}What about the ones who fell?
{30441}{30483}Form up and move out!
{30969}{31000}He's breathing!
{31021}{31053}Hang on!
{32540}{32645}I am Ashitaka! I have come|from far to the east!
{32646}{32733}Are you ancient gods|of the forest of the Deer God?
{33129}{33155}Leave!
{33641}{33705}A kodama? Are they here, too?
{33760}{33822}You're hurt. Keep still.
{33950}{34046}They won't harm you.|They're a sign the woods are healthy.
{34048}{34098}They'll bring their lord!
{34100}{34155}Who? The wolf?
{34158}{34252}No, a huge monster!
{34311}{34345}It's gone!
{34474}{34574}Yakul's not afraid.|There's no danger here.
{34614}{34701}We beg passage|through your woods.
{34986}{35029}Let's go back! Please!
{35050}{35150}There's a trail across the river.|We'll never get through these woods!
{35163}{35219}The current's too strong.
{35221}{35306}And if we don't get this man back soon,|it'll be too late.
{35435}{35518}Are you showing us the way,|or getting us lost?
{35869}{35966}Sir! These things|aren't helping us get home.
{35968}{36011}There's more and more of them!
{36490}{36583}This is your mother? A fine tree!
{37571}{37676}That girl and the wolves...|so this is where they live...
{37691}{37807}We're getting in deeper, sir.|This way leads into the other world.
{37808}{37857}Yes, let's take a rest.
{38141}{38171}Tracks...
{38318}{38419}Three toes...and still fresh.
{39699}{39739}Sir! What's wrong?
{40535}{40634}Are you all right, sir?|You're awfully pale...
{40660}{40706}I told you!
{40707}{40762}Did you see something?
{40763}{40799}Forget it.
{40831}{40897}Hang on a little longer.
{40899}{40941}I'm sorry.
{41094}{41137}It's gone...
{41191}{41278}Why does he suddenly feel so light?
{41280}{41350}Hey! It doesn't hurt!
{41383}{41443}I'm cured!...ow! No, it's broken.
{41578}{41682}Sir! You're exactly right!|We're back at the ironworks!
{42454}{42486}It's a fort!
{42487}{42539}Lady Eboshi's ironworks.
{42541}{42613}They melt iron sand into iron.
{42623}{42655}Hey!
{42680}{42728}Hey!
{42755}{42826}- Someone's coming from the woods!|- The wolf princess?
{42846}{42928}It's me! Koroku the ox-driver!
{43027}{43098}It's true! He's crossing the lake!
{43123}{43235}What's all this noise?!|Be quiet when I'm writing!
{43237}{43303}Koruku's come back from the dead!
{43305}{43330}What?!
{43620}{43663}You're not a ghost.
{43665}{43737}- Where are the others?|- Four of you fell...
{43750}{43786}It's just us left.
{43864}{43920}It's never the guards that die.
{43922}{43954}Move!
{43968}{44051}Who's the man in the hood, sir?
{44053}{44090}An outsider...
{44123}{44264}Listen, Riflemen...this gentleman|carried your man all the way here.
{44266}{44307}Thank him.
{44318}{44402}Ow! Don't grab me there!
{44429}{44499}Hey, you! Wait!
{44781}{44849}First, my thanks|for bringing back our men.
{44852}{44911}But something bothers me...
{44913}{44999}You got here in less than|half the time we did...
{45001}{45079}...through the Deer God's forest,|carrying two...
{45080}{45136}Koroku! You're alive!
{45138}{45176}Toki!
{45266}{45357}Look at that leg! How are you|going to drive oxen now?!
{45359}{45388}But...but...
{45390}{45483}Scaring me half to death!|The wolf-god should've eaten you!
{45485}{45540}Then I could find a better husband!
{45541}{45608}Toki! They're all listening!
{45611}{45680}Toki, save your love-talk for later.
{45707}{45765}And you! Leaving them there to die!
{45768}{45857}Some escort you are!|You don't do any real work here.
{45859}{45906}At least act when there's danger!
{45908}{45955}What could I do?
{45957}{46039}Thank you. My husband's an idiot,|but I'm glad he's safe.
{46054}{46140}Good. I was afraid maybe|I'd done something wrong.
{46264}{46337}You look very handsome.|Show us your face.
{46339}{46367}Gonza...
{46396}{46493}I would like to thank the traveler.|Bring him to me later.
{46495}{46519}Koroku...
{46555}{46627}It's good you're back. I apologize.
{46652}{46758}Don't say that, Milady. He'll just|take advantage of you.
{46776}{46878}Forgive me, Toki. I shouldn't|have let it happen.
{46880}{46972}If you hadn't been there, Milady...
{46973}{47022}...the wolves would've got them all.
{47080}{47160}Go and rest, Traveler.
{47276}{47329}Hey! You are handsome!
{47991}{48071}We had to fight off Moro|to bring this rice, you know.
{48072}{48108}Dish it out!
{48146}{48188}Where?
{48190}{48227}Him?
{48229}{48285}Toki was right!
{48287}{48334}- He is handsome!|- A bit young...
{48336}{48400}That never stopped you before!
{48416}{48472}Quiet out there! We lost two men!
{48473}{48526}There's lots of handsome men here!
{48528}{48577}Bunch of cowherds!
{48579}{48695}Come over to our place, Traveler!|Forget this stinking barn!
{48697}{48807}Watch your mouth! We risked our lives|to bring the rice you're eating.
{48810}{48888}And who made the iron|that bought that rice?
{48889}{48946}We work those bellows|all night long!
{48967}{49042}I would like to see where you work,|if you don't mind...
{49044}{49068}Really?
{49070}{49123}We'll have to work in make-up!
{49124}{49164}Rouge, too?
{49189}{49260}Don't forget! We'll be waiting!
{49292}{49362}Don't mind them, sir.
{49388}{49453}Lady Eboshi spoils them.
{49455}{49506}A good town has happy women.
{49522}{49597}But women working the bellows|in an ironworks?
{49599}{49668}Their presence defiles the iron.
{49680}{49780}Milady buys up the contract|of every brothel girl she finds!
{49782}{49833}She's kind, that's all.
{49835}{49882}There's rice on your face, old man.
{49884}{49983}But she's not afraid|of ancient laws, or of curses.
{49984}{50055}Or of gods, either.
{50056}{50124}You should've seen her with Nago!
{50126}{50152}'Nago'?
{50154}{50243}A huge boar-god. He ruled|the forest around here.
{50246}{50317}We couldn't get near the mountains.
{50319}{50396}All we could do was|sit here and look up at them.
{50430}{50489}The sand down below was worked out.
{50505}{50617}Lots of people had their eye on|this place. The boars got them all.
{50619}{50712}To get sand, we have to|clear the trees.
{50724}{50760}Nago got mad.
{51158}{51203}There they go again!
{51260}{51348}Then Lady Eboshi came along|with her guns.
{52003}{52045}Sir? What's wrong?
{52131}{52177}Does your arm hurt?
{52178}{52250}I was just thinking about that boar...
{52258}{52339}He must have died full of hate.
{52488}{52557}Sorry to keep you waiting...
{52558}{52596}That's good iron.
{52608}{52672}We were late with|tomorrow's shipment.
{52731}{52797}Let's have a rest. Tell the others.
{52829}{52916}Some think you're spying|for the samurai, or the wolf princess.
{52945}{53017}Many have their eyes on our iron.
{53019}{53066}May I ask why you're here?
{53221}{53267}I'm sure you know this.
{53291}{53410}It shattered the bones of a giant boar,|rotted his flesh and made him a monster.
{53427}{53543}When I tried to stop him, I was left|with this scar: a curse unto death.
{53557}{53638}Where is your land?|I've never seen an elk like yours.
{53660}{53742}Between north and east.|That's all I will say.
{53744}{53840}Answer when you're asked|or I'll cut you in two!
{53852}{53910}What do you plan to do?
{53945}{54004}See with eyes unclouded.
{54024}{54072}'Eyes unclouded'?
{54188}{54221}I see.
{54222}{54281}Come. I'll show you my secret.
{54282}{54312}Milady!
{54313}{54359}Take over, Gonza.
{55826}{55891}My garden, where none dare come.
{55905}{55961}Come, if you wish|to know my secret.
{56158}{56193}Good evening.
{56370}{56429}We've just finished.
{56465}{56497}It's still heavy.
{56499}{56561}You hold it so lightly...
{56564}{56633}Too light and it'll fall apart.
{56647}{56751}They aren't for me.|They're for the other women here.
{56765}{56809}Won't that be a sight!
{56812}{56902}This is the new gun|these people have contrived.
{56904}{56953}The Chinese ones are too heavy.
{56970}{57049}It will kill monsters|and pierce samurai armor.
{57065}{57154}Beware! Lady Eboshi|wants to rule the world!
{57176}{57255}I'm sorry to rush you.|I'll send sake later.
{57257}{57293}Won't that be nice!
{57337}{57430}You stole the boar's woods|and made a monster of him.
{57431}{57507}Now will you breed new hatreds|with those guns?
{57533}{57583}I regret that you suffer.
{57585}{57653}I fired that shot.
{57664}{57747}It is me that brainless pig|should have cursed.
{58176}{58245}Would your right hand like to kill me?
{58261}{58319}To lift the curse, my left would, too.
{58320}{58379}But I fear it would not stop there.
{58393}{58464}Must it kill us all to be at peace?
{58466}{58570}Milady...Osa speaks.
{58579}{58695}Milady...do not scorn|the young man's strength.
{58720}{58814}Young man, I too am cursed.
{58815}{58900}I know well your rage|and your grief.
{58903}{59020}I know this, but I beg you|not to kill this lady.
{59022}{59165}She is the only one|who looked upon us as human.
{59187}{59250}Without fear of our disease...
{59252}{59362}...she washed our rotting flesh,|bandaged us...
{59432}{59459}Osa...
{59461}{59548}Life is suffering. It is hard.
{59551}{59663}The world is cursed, people are cursed,|but still we wish to live...
{59665}{59728}Forgive my foolish raving...
{60198}{60238}They're back.
{60254}{60368}At night they come to plant trees|and take back the mountain.
{60371}{60451}Ashitaka, will you stay here|and work with me?
{60474}{60532}Do you want even|the Deer God's woods?
{60535}{60642}Without the ancient gods,|the wild ones are mere beasts.
{60654}{60778}With the forest gone and the wolves|with it, this will be a land of riches.
{60779}{60821}That girl will be human.
{60850}{60874}Who?
{60888}{60970}Mononoke, the wild girl whose soul|the wolves stole.
{60971}{61027}She lives to kill me.
{61160}{61251}It is said the blood of the Deer God|will cure disease.
{61252}{61383}It could cure these people,|and perhaps even lift your curse.
{61384}{61477}Milady...what do you think?
{61489}{61567}Very well made. Perfect|for ruling the world.
{61569}{61627}But it's still a bit heavy.
{61629}{61654}Oh, dear!
{62300}{62350}Look who's here!
{62363}{62410}Let me work the bellows.
{62411}{62455}Huh? Hey, wait!
{62524}{62560}May I try?
{62592}{62644}If he insists...
{62941}{62994}You really came!
{62995}{63042}What did I tell you?
{63043}{63118}Look, she's fixing her kimono!
{63143}{63195}You'll never keep that pace.
{63217}{63252}It's hard work.
{63255}{63318}Yep. We work four days' straight.
{63338}{63381}Is life hard here?
{63383}{63494}Yeah, but it's better than|life in the towns.
{63496}{63585}We eat our fill,|and the men know their place.
{63599}{63631}I see...
{64723}{64782}- You go tomorrow?|- Stay longer!
{64784}{64822}Work here!
{64824}{64901}Thank you, but there is someone|I must meet.
{65057}{65085}She's here!
{65225}{65262}The wolf princess!
{66170}{66194}It's her!
{66217}{66254}Stop!
{66266}{66301}I don't want to fight you!
{66425}{66473}She's after Milady!
{66731}{66833}Build up the fires! Riflemen to|the stockade! Keep her inside!
{66835}{66912}Stay at your posts!
{66925}{66981}She's up on the roof!.
{66983}{67051}Don't get excited! Keep working!
{67053}{67092}The fire mustn't go out!
{67118}{67209}- Is she alone?|- Yes. We have her cornered.
{67210}{67264}It's Milady she came for.
{67265}{67321}Oh well...come on.
{67533}{67621}Can you hear me, Princess Mononoke?|I'm here.
{67654}{67709}If you would avenge your tribe...
{67730}{67830}...here are some who seek|vengeance for husbands...
{67832}{67882}...killed by wolves.
{67884}{67944}Come out!|We have a score to settle!
{68187}{68229}There she is!
{68302}{68380}Out of the way! You'll get hit!
{68543}{68588}It's a trap! Stop!
{68615}{68706}Wolf-God Princess!|Go back to the woods!
{68794}{68859}Don't die for nothing!
{68877}{68909}I knew it!
{68910}{68964}Let him do as he likes.
{69464}{69518}Got her! She's falling!
{69520}{69554}Stay back!
{69565}{69624}Even cut off, the head can still bite.
{69678}{69719}Aim where she falls.
{70167}{70204}Fire!
{70409}{70453}Stay back!
{70659}{70683}Wake up!
{70827}{70855}No!
{71324}{71348}Get her!
{71349}{71393}Don't let her go!
{71394}{71423}Kill her!
{71513}{71564}Are you all right, sir?
{71792}{71848}Out of my way!
{71988}{72061}Villain! You're one of them, too!
{72128}{72156}Halt!
{72254}{72287}Step aside.
{72694}{72742}What are you doing?!
{72744}{72787}The girl is mine.
{72830}{72882}I'm sure she'll make a lovely wife.
{72894}{72969}There is a demon inside you.|And in her.
{73106}{73222}Look on this! It is the form|of the hate within me!
{73234}{73291}It rots my flesh,|and summons my death!
{73321}{73364}Do not make the hate grow!
{73366}{73439}Enough talk of your curse!
{73441}{73479}I'll cut that arm off!.
{73602}{73641}Milady!
{73708}{73750}Someone take her!
{73898}{73961}Don't worry. She'll be all right.
{74083}{74131}I will take the girl!
{74152}{74228}Wait! You don't treat|Lady Eboshi like that!
{74305}{74333}Don't move!
{74622}{74661}Kiyo, no!
{74793}{74825}He still walks...
{74980}{75043}- How's Milady?|- Safe, sir.
{75045}{75143}Bring me my gun!|Riflemen, assemble here!
{75145}{75183}They won't get away!
{75219}{75259}Toki, quick!
{75382}{75425}You're...
{75786}{75826}You can't pass, sir.
{75839}{75900}The gate can't be opened|without leave.
{75986}{76021}Turn back, please...
{76022}{76109}You helped one of us.|We don't want to harm you.
{76138}{76233}I came on my own two feet.|I will leave on them.
{76269}{76337}It takes ten men|to open that gate!
{76530}{76577}Sir, no! You'll die!
{76788}{76832}He moved it!
{77001}{77044}Move aside!
{77136}{77170}Wolves!
{77172}{77196}Flint!
{77210}{77269}Stop! Your princess is safe!
{77341}{77373}I'm coming!
{77374}{77408}Yakul, let's go!
{77526}{77561}I thank you.
{77726}{77760}He's gone...
{78313}{78341}Wait!
{78385}{78424}He's mine!
{78701}{78787}Did they shoot you?|Are you dead?
{78878}{78955}Why did you stop me?|Speak while you still live!
{79000}{79064}I didn't want you to die.
{79067}{79166}I'm not afraid to die|if it will drive the humans away!
{79185}{79250}I knew that when I first saw you.
{79252}{79335}You've wasted your life|by getting in my way!
{79432}{79508}I'll cut your throat!|That'll shut you up!
{79543}{79567}Live...
{79570}{79631}I don't listen to humans!
{79678}{79737}You're beautiful...
{79819}{79908}What's wrong, San?|Shall I crunch him for you?
{80195}{80227}The apes...
{80261}{80366}Apes! Do you mean disrespect|to the tribe of Moro?
{80390}{80442}This is our forest.
{80444}{80496}Give us man.
{80498}{80578}Give us man and go.
{80580}{80636}Leave, before my fangs find you.
{80648}{80688}Go.
{80690}{80743}We eat man.
{80747}{80780}We eat him.
{80792}{80834}Let us eat man.
{80835}{80937}Why would the tribe of the apes...
{80939}{80995}...want to eat a man?
{81010}{81116}We eat man. We have his strength.
{81118}{81200}We want strength|to drive humans away.
{81203}{81312}You won't get that power|by eating a man.
{81314}{81409}All that will do is turn you|into something else!
{81422}{81560}We plant trees.|Humans destroy them.
{81562}{81638}Forest does not come back.|We kill humans.
{81654}{81752}The Deer God is with us.|Don't give up. Plant your trees.
{81754}{81806}We will fight for you to the last!
{81819}{81916}Deer God will not fight. We die.
{81918}{81998}Wolf girl not care.|Wolf girl human.
{82038}{82121}You monkey! I'll break your neck!
{82196}{82228}Stop it!
{82436}{82479}It's all right.
{82481}{82580}You go ahead. I'll take care|of the human.
{82582}{82622}What about him?
{82623}{82659}Can we eat him?
{82731}{82792}No. Go on.
{82970}{83027}Come here. Let's be friends.
{83043}{83117}Help me carry your master.
{85889}{85983}You're smart. You know|not to set foot on this island.
{86021}{86057}Humans stink!
{86298}{86362}Go where you will. You're free.
{88575}{88618}There he is!
{88638}{88706}The night-walker! At last!
{88718}{88754}Quick! Come and look!
{88776}{88849}There's why we've been sitting|in these stinking bearskins!
{88868}{88914}Don't look! You'll go blind!
{88930}{88999}This from the West Land's|best hunter?
{89001}{89068}This is a charter from the Mikado...
{89070}{89135}...allowing us|to subdue the Deer God!
{89274}{89344}At night he becomes|the night-walker.
{89346}{89412}As night becomes day|he changes form.
{89414}{89519}He's vanishing...over there!
{91503}{91531}Jiko!
{91533}{91575}I know.
{91594}{91630}Over there.
{91947}{92003}There's hundreds of them.
{92005}{92063}They're not from these woods.
{92064}{92121}They're lords of some other mountain.
{92308}{92356}It's Okkoto!
{92357}{92423}From the South Island?
{92424}{92473}There's no mistaking those tusks.
{92492}{92551}Looks like he brought his whole tribe!
{92626}{92674}He's seen us! Fall back!
{92996}{93047}Come on! Jump!
{94328}{94370}There's no wound!
{94615}{94647}Yakul...
{95210}{95312}If you're awake thankYakul.|He watched you the whole time.
{95359}{95403}How do you know his name?
{95428}{95550}He's told me all about you,|your village, your forest...
{95568}{95656}The Deer God brought you|back to life, so I'll help you.
{95696}{95785}I had this dream...a golden deer...
{95787}{95815}Eat.
{95946}{95970}Chew.
{98123}{98212}We're here to kill the humans|and save the forest.
{98213}{98260}Why are there humans here?
{98262}{98321}The girl is San, my daughter.
{98323}{98457}The humans are everywhere. Go back|to your mountain and kill them there.
{98474}{98559}We kill for the forest|of the Deer God.
{98561}{98618}Why is there a man here?
{98637}{98731}The Deer God healed his wound.|We must give him back.
{98733}{98864}The Deer God saved him?|The Deer God healed his wound?!
{98888}{98959}Why did he not save Nago?
{98961}{99044}Is he not guardian of the forest?!
{99046}{99148}The Deer God gives life,|and takes it away.
{99150}{99238}Have you boars forgotten even that?
{99250}{99351}No! You begged the Deer God for him.
{99353}{99400}You did not beg for Nago!
{99416}{99517}He feared death...l, like him...
{99519}{99621}...carry within me|a poisoned human stone.
{99622}{99729}Nago fled. I remain,|and contemplate my death.
{99731}{99777}Go to the Deer God!
{99778}{99857}I have lived long enough, San.
{99858}{99937}The Deer God will take my life.
{99949}{100014}No, Mother! You've protected|the Deer God!
{100028}{100148}We are not fooled! Nago was beautiful|and strong. Our brother would not run!
{100164}{100226}You wolves ate him!
{100239}{100307}Silence! You slander my mother!
{100315}{100382}Hear me, O wild mountain gods...
{100405}{100473}It was I who killed Nago.
{100490}{100584}He had become a demon,|and attacked our village.
{100596}{100682}A huge boar. Here is my proof.
{100822}{100922}I came to this land to ask|the Deer God to lift this curse.
{100944}{101030}He healed my wound,|but the scar remains.
{101070}{101174}I must suffer until|the curse destroys me.
{101282}{101375}Okkoto! Good! Someone who can listen.
{101490}{101515}Okkoto, wait!
{101529}{101569}You mustn't eat him!
{101618}{101722}You are Moro's daughter.|I have heard of you.
{101760}{101794}Your eyes...
{101809}{101878}Stand back. I will not eat him.
{101887}{101914}Wolf-God Princess...
{101935}{102027}Do not fear. I tell of Nago's end.
{102345}{102430}My thanks to you, young one.
{102432}{102584}It grieves us that a demon|has come from our tribe.
{102624}{102713}Lord Okkoto...do you know|how I may lift the curse?
{102745}{102875}Leave this forest. When next we meet,|I will have to kill you.
{102887}{102995}You cannot win against|the guns of the humans.
{102997}{103131}Look on my tribe, Moro.|We grow small, and we grow stupid.
{103133}{103188}To go on in this manner...
{103189}{103277}...is to end as game|the humans hunt for meat.
{103279}{103395}To risk all on a final battle|is to play into human hands.
{103410}{103491}I ask not for the help of wolves.
{103501}{103657}Should we die even to the very last,|we will leave the humans in awe.
{104267}{104303}The Deer God!
{104692}{104752}Keep the oxen together!
{104833}{104877}Hold your fire...let them come!
{104906}{104934}Fire!
{105079}{105113}Reload! Quick!
{105474}{105563}That damned Eboshi's fighting|the wrong enemy!
{105565}{105628}You go on ahead and hide.
{106142}{106195}Here they come!
{106330}{106364}Chief...
{106366}{106399}Well done.
{106416}{106492}We're moving out. Tell the others.
{106602}{106640}Hello, Jiko.
{106642}{106753}The Emperor presses, and you sport|with country samurai...
{106769}{106853}Lord Asano sets them against me.
{106862}{106930}Asano? A powerful man...
{106932}{106989}He wants my iron.
{106990}{107032}Greedy, isn't he.
{107052}{107121}But now is no time to fight men.
{107122}{107191}The boars are gathering in the forest.
{107214}{107267}Give him the iron.
{107269}{107359}Keep your promise to the Emperor,|then smash Asano.
{107362}{107446}Quick, Milady!|Asano's men are coming!
{107574}{107646}Speak of the devil! A messenger.
{107648}{107716}A messenger.|Remember your manners.
{107786}{107825}Welcome home!
{107893}{107943}Aren't you going to see him?
{108026}{108150}Eboshi, Mistress of the ironworks,|you have fought well!
{108179}{108294}I bring a message from my lord.|Open your gates!
{108296}{108367}We hear you fine from there!
{108369}{108438}Milady took this mountain|from the boars!
{108439}{108493}Now it's worth something|and you want it!
{108495}{108530}On your way!
{108532}{108595}You have no respect, woman!
{108598}{108635}No respect?
{108637}{108754}We haven't had respect|since we were born!
{108756}{108816}You want iron? Have some!
{109005}{109077}They're really something!
{109079}{109144}Samurai or forest god,|they don't care.
{109161}{109242}Eboshi's women don't lack courage.
{109288}{109333}What good is this paper?
{109348}{109427}Well, it's helped in getting|the best hunters and trackers.
{109429}{109499}We're after gods, not just beasts.
{109533}{109577}Yes, Milady?
{109585}{109649}Do you know who this paper is from?
{109660}{109695}The Mikado.
{109697}{109752}- Mikado?|- Who's he?
{109766}{109801}The Emperor.
{109818}{109892}They're really something!
{109903}{109937}Off you go.
{109978}{110084}As we make iron here,|the forest grows weak.
{110086}{110135}That way costs fewer lives.
{110155}{110215}We've spent too much time|and money.
{110217}{110312}We didn't send 40 riflemen|just for the iron.
{110314}{110385}So the Emperor says, at least.
{110388}{110507}Surely he doesn't believe that the|Deer God's head confers immortality?
{110510}{110614}I'm not privy to the thoughts|of the Emperor.
{110616}{110646}Best not to be.
{110677}{110713}You have my word.
{110715}{110820}The boars will be easier|than Moro and her tribe.
{110844}{110934}Call out that shady bunch|you've got hidden under the cliff.
{110950}{111050}So I'm found out, am l?
{111052}{111108}One more thing...
{111118}{111168}Did a young man pass by here?
{111185}{111252}Riding a red elk?
{111266}{111298}He left.
{111767}{111815}They make my skin crawl!
{111816}{111908}They're not ordinary hunters.|They're special scouts.
{111927}{111975}Let us go with you!
{111977}{112016}Don't trust those men!
{112032}{112099}We can't help you from here|if anything happens!
{112101}{112142}We've learned how to shoot...
{112158}{112234}That's the reason I want you here.
{112247}{112315}I fear humans more than forest gods.
{112344}{112432}With the Deer God dead,|things will become clear.
{112434}{112529}Is the Deer God's head|all the Emperor really wants?
{112552}{112639}We may have to fight|the riflemen, too.
{112665}{112748}We can't trust men.|Stay on your toes.
{112762}{112862}Don't worry about Lady Eboshi.|I'll protect her.
{112864}{112920}- You will, will you?|- What?!
{112922}{112979}Maybe if you were a woman...
{114659}{114691}Does it hurt?
{114744}{114832}You could end it all|by jumping, you know.
{114834}{114911}When your strength returns,|the scar will grow restless.
{114940}{114999}I feel like I've slept for days.
{115016}{115079}I dreamed San was tending to me.
{115082}{115248}I hoped you would cry out in your sleep,|so I could bite off your head.
{115250}{115298}A beautiful woods...
{115300}{115343}Are the boars moving yet?
{115358}{115452}Go back into the cave, boy.|You can't hear it...
{115454}{115523}The cry of the woods|trampled under by boars...
{115550}{115667}I sit here listening to it|and to the crumbling of my body...
{115669}{115727}...and wait for that woman...
{115728}{115813}...dreaming of the moment|I crush her head in my jaws.
{115828}{115911}Can't humans and the forest|live together in peace?
{115921}{115958}Can't this be stopped?
{115960}{116023}The humans are gathering.
{116024}{116087}Their fire will reach even here.
{116089}{116171}And San? Do you intend|to take her with you?
{116173}{116267}How like a human|to think only of himself!.
{116284}{116423}She is a daughter of our tribe.|When the woods die, so will she.
{116426}{116488}Set her free! She's human!
{116504}{116539}Silence, boy!
{116540}{116612}What can you do for her?
{116634}{116776}The humans who violated the forest|threw her in my path as they ran from me.
{116779}{116859}Now she cannot be human,|and she cannot be wolf.
{116861}{116945}My poor, ugly,|lovely daughter...
{116948}{117007}Can you save her?!
{117053}{117121}I don't know,|but together we can live.
{117176}{117293}How? Will you join with San|and fight the human race?
{117312}{117377}No. All that does is cause more hatred.
{117391}{117498}There is nothing you can do, boy.
{117500}{117576}Soon the scar will kill you.
{117578}{117634}Leave here when the sun rises.
{117975}{117999}Can you walk?
{118067}{118131}Thanks to you and the Deer God.
{119600}{119662}Yakul! Were you worried?
{119779}{119832}My legs are so weak!
{120592}{120655}It's so quiet...where are the kodama?
{120816}{120881}I can smell the ironworks...
{121047}{121139}Thank you for guiding me.|I have a favor to ask you.
{121189}{121237}Give this to San.
{121443}{121475}Let's go.
{122225}{122282}What a stench!
{122284}{122398}That's not just smoke.|It's to blunt our sense of smell.
{122400}{122423}That woman!
{122660}{122695}She knows we're here...
{122697}{122775}- It's a foolish trap.|- A trap?
{122787}{122886}They're trying to lure the boars|out of the woods.
{122888}{122931}They're planning something.
{122933}{123028}We've got to warn them!|They'll be killed!
{123047}{123106}Okkoto is no fool.
{123108}{123216}The boars know it's a trap,|but still they'll charge.
{123218}{123279}They are a proud race.
{123297}{123393}The last one alive|will still be charging forward.
{123512}{123549}They're cutting trees.
{123551}{123595}To anger them.
{123657}{123719}Mother, this is farewell.
{123720}{123785}The smoke will blind Okkoto.
{123787}{123822}I will be his eyes.
{123845}{123888}As you will.
{123890}{123990}Although there is a life for you|with that boy...
{123998}{124043}I hate humans!
{124330}{124390}From Ashitaka? For me?
{124480}{124504}It's pretty...
{124523}{124565}You two go with San.
{124568}{124658}- I will stay with the Deer God.|- Let's go.
{125164}{125257}The tribe of Moro fights with you!|Where is Okkoto?
{125332}{125363}Thank you.
{127416}{127448}The ironworks!
{127588}{127616}Let's go!
{127708}{127733}Who goes there?!
{127740}{127764}Samurai!
{127814}{127838}Halt!
{127864}{127899}Let me pass!
{128298}{128333}Who was that?!
{128429}{128489}He's stopping them!
{128504}{128546}Don't waste your arrows!
{129130}{129157}Quick!
{129159}{129197}You're right! It is him!
{129199}{129223}In the flesh!
{129224}{129280}Ashitaka!
{129281}{129305}Toki?
{129317}{129348}Are you all right?
{129350}{129383}As you see us!
{129385}{129494}They thought they'd catch us|while the men were away!
{129496}{129535}We showed 'em!
{129536}{129604}- They thought we'd be easy!|- Where's Lady Eboshi?
{129607}{129718}She took every man who could move|and went to kill the Deer God.
{129720}{129767}We're cut off and can't reach her!
{129770}{129852}The Deer God?|So that sound before...
{129854}{129917}Sir! I've still got your bow!
{129919}{129980}What about his saddle and cloak?!
{129982}{130019}- But...|- Useless!
{130034}{130074}Koroku, thanks!
{130076}{130139}I'll bring help. Can you hold out?
{130142}{130225}We'll pour hot iron on them|if we have to!
{130227}{130263}Hurry, Ashitaka!
{130265}{130314}Bring Lady Eboshi!
{130438}{130467}Missed!
{130468}{130516}They're bringing boats. Hurry!
{130518}{130612}Bring Lady Eboshi! We'll fight, too!
{130653}{130699}I'll be back!
{130767}{130820}We'll be here!
{130898}{130931}Get that man!
{131170}{131216}They're after us, Yakul!
{132247}{132295}Burning flesh...
{132440}{132472}Yakul!
{133405}{133432}Stay back!
{133750}{133786}Show me the wound...
{133832}{133894}Wait here. I'll be right back.
{133965}{134000}Stay, I said!
{134264}{134301}We're almost there...
{135366}{135396}Who goes there?!
{135413}{135495}Outsiders are not allowed here.
{135516}{135627}I have a message for Lady Eboshi.
{135639}{135729}She's not here. State your business|and I'll pass it on.
{135746}{135798}I will speak to her! Where is she?!
{135801}{135890}Young sir...so you're alive...
{135905}{135949}You've had a bad time...
{135951}{135996}There's still men buried.
{135997}{136025}It was horrible...
{136041}{136089}The ironworks are under attack.
{136107}{136209}There's still time. The women are|holding the inner stockade.
{136211}{136243}The bastards!
{136245}{136301}Asano waited till we left!
{136314}{136357}Where's Lady Eboshi?
{136358}{136424}She's gone after the Deer God.
{136425}{136469}Call her back!
{136486}{136543}If you're done, get out of here!
{136545}{136568}Back to work!
{136571}{136612}And the ironworks?
{136613}{136655}Now wait a minute!
{136665}{136718}They want to abandon the ironworks!
{136737}{136784}If we wait we'll be too late!
{136786}{136826}Send a messenger!
{136828}{136903}The woods are huge.|He'd never find her!
{136906}{136975}Send one of your trackers!
{136990}{137054}Lady Eboshi's being used.
{137071}{137149}Were there any wolves|with the boars?
{137151}{137206}San, er, the wolf girl?
{137208}{137292}I don't know...it was pitch black|when they came at us.
{137294}{137340}She was there.
{137350}{137420}We were in the front...
{137422}{137448}And?
{137450}{137549}I don't know. Suddenly|I didn't know what was going on.
{137551}{137630}The scouts put us out there|to lure the boars in.
{137632}{137683}There were mines underneath us...
{137684}{137737}...and grenades from above.
{139022}{139058}Where's San?!
{139146}{139221}Be still! I want to help you.
{139307}{139395}A wolf!. There's a wolf|still alive over here!
{139397}{139424}Sir, what...
{139532}{139555}Sir!
{139557}{139610}Move! What are you doing, boy?!
{139636}{139724}He's going to take me to Eboshi.
{139726}{139796}So you're with them, are you?
{139808}{139840}Move.
{139857}{139946}What's more important, the head of|the Deer God or the ironworks?!
{139962}{139991}Poison darts!
{140140}{140169}Stop!
{140326}{140377}Give me a hand!
{140622}{140658}He's out!
{140936}{141011}Go through the swamp|and hide near the lake.
{141021}{141085}The riflemen are with them.|Be careful.
{141099}{141174}Take this. My last arrow's broken.
{141226}{141257}You go with them.
{141259}{141300}Take care of him!
{141389}{141440}Find San! That's where Eboshi is!
{141726}{141808}Don't fall behind the scouts.|Today we finish this!
{141877}{141904}Jiko...
{141906}{141953}Well? How does it look?
{141955}{142073}Okkoto's hurt. He and the girl|are going to the Deer God.
{142089}{142169}So they're going to ask him|for help...stay with them.
{142186}{142248}But stay hidden, or he won't appear.
{142250}{142300}Of course.
{142321}{142392}Is that boar's blood on his face?
{142402}{142468}That's how they trick the boars.
{142662}{142744}Keep going! We're almost at|the Deer God's pond.
{143163}{143199}Something's coming!
{143266}{143341}Something's wrong, Okkoto!|Just a bit further!
{143359}{143404}Something bad is coming.
{143406}{143477}There's too much blood.|I can't smell what it is.
{143595}{143620}The apes!
{143623}{143664}You did this.
{143666}{143722}It is your fault. Forest will die.
{143736}{143830}Is this how you thank those|who fought for your forest?
{143833}{143885}You brought ruin.
{143886}{143950}Things neither animal nor human!
{143965}{144024}Neither animal nor human?
{144171}{144229}- They're here!|- It's the end!
{144695}{144720}Warriors!
{144802}{144841}They've returned!
{144874}{145014}My warriors have returned|from the land of the dead!
{145110}{145233}Forward, my warriors!|To the Deer God!
{145386}{145479}Okkoto, no! Your warriors|haven't come back to life!
{145610}{145669}They wear boar skins|to hide their scent!
{145672}{145704}They're men!
{145769}{145859}Stop! They want us to take them|to the Deer God!
{145966}{146014}Come out, Deer God!
{146015}{146155}If you are lord of this forest,|revive my warriors to slay the humans.
{146202}{146251}Okkoto! Still your heart!
{146271}{146347}We're surrounded! He's done for.|Leave him!
{146350}{146419}No! Then he'll become a demon!
{146438}{146527}Tell Mother it's the Deer God|the humans want!
{146540}{146598}She'll know what to do!
{146642}{146696}We can't let our kind die out!
{146730}{146761}Go!
{147225}{147345}I'll kill the first one that moves,|and tell the whole forest what you are!
{147608}{147644}Ashitaka?
{147797}{147821}Bastards!
{147993}{148095}I burn! A flame bursts from within me!
{148131}{148172}No!
{148175}{148244}No, Okkoto! Don't turn into a demon!
{148291}{148327}Okkoto!
{148392}{148416}An answer!
{148510}{148535}What is it?
{148536}{148576}- San's in danger!|- Let's go!
{149260}{149295}I'm hot!
{149510}{149537}No!
{149539}{149613}I don't want to be a monster!|Okkoto!
{149892}{149925}Too slow! Get on!
{150271}{150309}A wolf!.
{150372}{150395}Eboshi!
{150562}{150602}Go on ahead!
{150635}{150685}Eboshi, listen!
{150688}{150720}Stop!
{150722}{150746}Ashitaka?
{150766}{150878}The samurai are attacking the ironworks!|The women are fighting back!
{150891}{150920}Leave the Deer God!
{150944}{151035}The men are heading back!|They're waiting for you!
{151049}{151105}What proof do you have?
{151107}{151191}None! I would have stayed|and fought if I could!
{151205}{151290}So it's 'don't kill the Deer God,|kill the samurai,' is it?
{151303}{151401}No! Can't the forest|and the ironworks live together?
{151459}{151503}Whose side is he on?
{151504}{151531}Let's go back!
{151551}{151676}I've done all I can for the women.|They can defend themselves.
{151730}{151797}There's the pond. He's around here!
{151829}{151883}It's now or never. Stay alert.
{151908}{151947}Do we need her?
{151949}{152034}We're killing a god.|Let her do it for us.
{152677}{152720}Moro! Are you dead?
{152722}{152755}San!
{152756}{152788}Where are you?
{152809}{152841}San!
{153025}{153051}Ashitaka!
{153233}{153257}Okkoto...
{153456}{153480}Leave, boy.
{153512}{153573}If we fight, the Deer God won't come.
{153685}{153753}Okkoto! Be still!
{153853}{153944}Okkoto! Give me the girl!|Where is San?
{153964}{154036}San, can you hear me?|It's me, Ashitaka!
{154188}{154218}San!
{154385}{154425}Shut him up!
{154537}{154583}Shoot him down!
{155164}{155193}San!
{155257}{155289}San!
{155357}{155392}Ashitaka!
{155490}{155521}San!
{155524}{155549}Ashitaka!
{155737}{155889}And here I was saving my last bit|of strength for that woman...
{155891}{155940}Close up!
{156361}{156422}Stay away from him.
{156424}{156466}The curse will fall on you.
{156695}{156736}Can you not even speak now?
{156765}{156872}Well done. Fall back|and tend to the wounded.
{156906}{156967}A horrible sight!
{157168}{157192}There he is!
{157497}{157561}Give me back my daughter!
{158084}{158120}Ashitaka...
{158122}{158180}Can you save San?
{158408}{158449}The Deer God...
{158709}{158741}Don't shoot!
{159076}{159176}Eboshi! Your enemy is not|the Deer God!
{159189}{159221}Guns can't hurt him...
{159222}{159255}Only through the head...
{159491}{159515}San!
{159758}{159790}Don't die!
{160447}{160512}Is the Deer God taking life?!
{160999}{161047}He's starting to change!
{161049}{161085}Watch closely.
{161102}{161151}This is how you kill a god.
{161154}{161216}He is also the god of death.
{161229}{161281}Do not shrink back.
{161675}{161714}Stop!
{161787}{161811}Eboshi!
{162104}{162168}You damn freak!
{162408}{162463}Got him! Get the head!
{163404}{163470}Jiko! Bring the box!
{163485}{163557}The porters are dead! Quick!
{163595}{163681}Don't touch the body!|It'll draw your life into it!
{163778}{163830}One head, as promised.
{164038}{164077}Milady!
{164079}{164136}Moro's head...it moved by itself!.
{164149}{164237}Come on, hurry! Run!
{164239}{164262}Jiko!
{164341}{164383}Run!
{164784}{164812}To the island!
{164815}{164848}I can't swim!
{164850}{164890}Then wade!
{165566}{165619}Give her to me! I'll kill her!
{165621}{165696}Moro's already taken her revenge.
{165709}{165734}Milady!
{165736}{165766}Help me!
{165849}{165908}Don't waste your sympathy...
{165921}{165992}I promised Toki I'd bring you back.
{166133}{166200}He's looking for his head.|We can't stay here.
{166202}{166225}San!
{166239}{166266}Help me!
{166267}{166331}No! You're on their side!
{166333}{166378}Take that woman and go away!
{166455}{166503}Keep away! I hate humans!
{166532}{166611}I am human...and so are you.
{166614}{166684}Shut up! I'm a wolf!.
{166717}{166753}Keep back!
{166891}{166968}I'm sorry. I tried to stop it.
{167140}{167239}It's over. Everything.|The forest is dead.
{167462}{167569}No, it's not. We're still alive.|Help me.
{168192}{168236}Wait! Help us!
{168239}{168305}A little crisis and they're useless!
{168385}{168427}Don't stop!
{168562}{168603}The head's moving!
{168677}{168719}It's calling him here!
{169760}{169787}That's fixed it.
{169789}{169819}Thanks.
{169828}{169865}It's very quiet...
{169867}{169906}They're waiting for dawn.
{169932}{170011}I wonder if that young man|found Eboshi...
{170013}{170133}I'm sure he did.|She's probably almost here now.
{170188}{170284}Look at that face! Hey, Koroku!
{170286}{170358}Let him sleep for now.
{170599}{170660}I don't like the sound of that...
{170962}{170991}The night-walker!
{171322}{171377}Hold your positions!
{171390}{171438}He's coming this way!
{171439}{171463}Run!
{171480}{171569}We guard the ironworks!|We promised Milady we would.
{171714}{171765}It's him! Ashitaka!
{171894}{171917}Get out!
{171937}{172005}The Deer God's coming after his head!
{172020}{172071}Touch that muck and you're dead!
{172087}{172149}Run into the lake!|The water'll slow it up!
{172170}{172255}The men and Lady Eboshi are coming|from the other side!
{172257}{172330}I'm going to give the head back!
{172332}{172356}Hurry!
{172368}{172413}He's coming!
{172414}{172450}What do we do?!
{172452}{172477}Stay calm!
{172490}{172525}To the lake!
{172530}{172588}Stay calm! Help the injured!
{172826}{172869}Not that way!
{173262}{173304}There goes the roof...
{173441}{173528}Once the forge starts to burn,|it's all over.
{173547}{173631}As long as we're alive, we'll manage.|Move out deeper.
{174067}{174107}There they are!
{174398}{174423}Go!
{174447}{174479}Wait!
{174519}{174570}You're still alive? Good!
{174589}{174654}I'll give the head back.|Put it down and run.
{174657}{174777}Give it back now? Don't be stupid.|The sun's coming up.
{174779}{174868}Look...a brainless, swollen|life-sucking god of death.
{174870}{174905}When the sun comes up, he'll vanish.
{174919}{174963}He's coming, Jiko. Quick!
{174966}{175083}Wanting all between heaven and hell|is the human condition.
{175095}{175127}I don't want to kill you...
{175147}{175187}Oh, dear...
{175190}{175253}Don't look so stern...
{175413}{175446}Run!
{175909}{175933}Ashitaka!
{176129}{176154}Uh-oh...
{176223}{176259}We're surrounded!
{176283}{176323}Come on, sun!
{176325}{176350}Open it!
{176352}{176401}Don't you understand? It's too late!
{176416}{176478}Don't waste time talking to him!
{176480}{176528}Human hands must return it!
{176550}{176618}Well, I warned you...
{176973}{177005}O Deer God...
{177008}{177053}We return your head!
{177072}{177120}Be at peace!
{177378}{177425}Here he comes!
{178173}{178204}He's stopped...
{178206}{178234}The men!
{178547}{178587}Milady!
{178589}{178629}Careful, she's hurt!
{179328}{179362}He's falling!
{179511}{179553}Hang on! Don't let go!
{181162}{181247}I didn't know the Deer God|made the flowers bloom...
{182000}{182045}San, look!
{182776}{182848}Even if they grow back,|they won't be the Deer God's woods.
{182870}{182910}The Deer God is dead.
{182928}{183013}The Deer God can't die.|He is life itself.
{183014}{183072}Life and death are his to give and take.
{183090}{183127}He's telling us we should live.
{183334}{183432}I like you, but I can't forgive|what people have done.
{183434}{183522}That's all right. You live in the|forest, and I'll live at the ironworks.
{183542}{183570}Together we'll live.
{183590}{183649}Yakul and I will visit you.
{183934}{184045}Can you believe it?|Saved thanks to a wolf!.
{184061}{184154}Someone bring Ashitaka.|I want to thank him.
{184156}{184253}We'll start over again.|We'll build a good village.
{184270}{184355}I give up...you can't win against fools!
