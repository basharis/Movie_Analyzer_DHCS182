1
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,477
Hey, Halphen... Going to Epernay?

2
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:49,239
- When?
- In half an hour.

3
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,316
In your truck?... Give me a ride.

4
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53,976
- Sure... Josephine?
- Of course!

5
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:56,987
- You're not the only one.
- Big deal!

6
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:04,390
Say, Maréchal...
You have to take up a staff officer.

7
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:06,395
He's picked the wrong time.

8
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:09,261
- Josephine again?
- Yeah, Josephine.

9
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:11,233
Where will all that get you?

10
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:13,497
She'll just have to wait.

11
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,848
Liquor kills!
Liquor drives you crazy!

12
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:33,183
The squadron leader drinks it!

13
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,191
Captain de Boeldieu.
Staff officer, division...

14
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,634
Do you know this photo, Mr. Maréchal?

15
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,608
Sure. Ricord took it with me.

16
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:53,337
And where can I find Mr. Ricord?

17
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:55,481
- On leave.
- Of course.

18
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,143
This gray smudge worries me...

19
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,310
Here, just below the road.

20
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:05,447
- That's not a road, it's a canal.
- No, a railway.

21
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,617
Such unanimity
honors our aerial cameras.

22
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:10,319
It was a foggy day.

23
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:12,829
I'd like to resolve this enigma.

24
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,695
I'll request a plane.

25
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:18,728
I'll go get ready, sir.

26
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:21,569
Flying suit or fur jacket?

27
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:26,075
No preference.
Flying suits smell, fur jackets shed.

28
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:28,544
Get me the fighter squadron.

29
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,268
Take a car to the sugar refinery.

30
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:52,671
I just shot down a Caudron fiighter.

31
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,397
If they're Officers,

32
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:58,074
invite them for lunch.

33
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:10,049
Freisler...

34
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,556
make us one of your famous
fruit punches

35
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:18,462
to celebrate the downing
of my twelfth plane.

36
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,562
Three bottles of Moselle...
two Rhine...

37
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:25,894
half a bottle of Martel...

38
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,572
three bubbly...

39
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,607
two seltzer...

40
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:31,969
pineapples...

41
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:40,112
Two officers. One is wounded.
I took him to the infirmary.

42
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:46,722
Captain von Rauffenstein,
CO, 21 st Squadron.

43
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:48,622
Captain de Boeldieu, staff officer.

44
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:52,925
Lt. Maréchal, pilot.

45
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,132
My apologies.

46
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:56,629
My officers.

47
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:02,506
I am honored to have French guests.

48
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,500
Now, gentlemen, let us eat.

49
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,410
Orderly, coats!

50
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:30,970
Freisler, your punch...

51
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:33,105
May I serve you?

52
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:36,333
I knew a Boeldieu in Berlin...

53
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,443
a Count de Boeldieu.

54
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,973
My cousin, Edmond de Boeldieu.

55
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:43,775
He was military attaché.

56
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,214
He's a fighter pilot now.

57
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:53,348
Aren't you eating?

58
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:56,859
I can't cut the meat.

59
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,291
- May I?
- Please do.

60
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,164
You speak good French.

61
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,959
I was a mechanic in Lyons.

62
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:06,833
No kidding!
Me too, I'm a mecha...

63
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:22,419
To Captain de Crussol,
French Flying Corps,

64
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,384
shotdown in flames...

65
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:27,685
From the Officers
ofthe German 21st Squadron.

66
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:30,419
I'm sorry about this coincidence.

67
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:39,428
May the earth lie lightly
on our valiant enemy.

68
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:58,246
I have orders to take custody
of the captured officers.

69
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:13,295
PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP N17
OFFICERS' CAMP

70
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,493
Read these gentlemen
the camp regulations.

71
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,927
"Officers will be treated
with the consideration due their rank. "

72
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:46,401
"However, you are reminded
that you are subject to German law. "

73
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:51,670
"You therefore must obey
the rules of German discipline. "

74
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:56,275
"Any German soldier here
has the right to give you orders

75
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:59,009
which must be obeyed without protest. "

76
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:03,815
"You must salute Officers
according to German army regulations. "

77
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,925
"If you attempt to escape,
sentries have orders to fire on officers

78
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:10,925
found outside camp limits. "

79
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,621
"Incorrect dress is not permitted. "

80
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:19,537
" Large crowds are forbidden.
You may not insult the German people,

81
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:23,540
"or write or speak to civilians
from outside the camp. "

82
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:28,273
"It is forbidden
to speak to the sentries. "

83
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:38,154
Gentlemen, we will now proceed
with some minor formalities.

84
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,907
Russian nouns are declined
just like in Latin.

85
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,349
- Newcomers.
- Let's warn them.

86
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:14,158
Angel of purity, angel of light!

87
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:17,658
Hide your valuables...

88
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,508
- What are they singing?
- To hide our valuables.

89
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:44,250
Don't touch!
Those belong to me.

90
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,234
I've got nothing, old man.

91
00:10:58,404 --> 00:11:00,736
Had I known,
I'd have brought some cash.

92
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,948
This conduct is unbecoming.

93
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:12,482
Sorry, it's our duty to search you.
This is war.

94
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:15,212
I perfectly agree,
but conduct it courteously.

95
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:18,219
If not, I'll see
your commanding officer.

96
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:32,966
How are you - kulele?
Lucky you - calyptus!

97
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:36,506
Here, Müller, have some chocolate.

98
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:39,075
You've no right to open my ham!

99
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:42,271
It's in the regulations.
I read them carefully.

100
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:45,440
It's rotten! You can have it!

101
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:48,918
He's hard to please.

102
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:52,182
I'm delighted when my folks
send a parcel.

103
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:54,656
Here we are,
in the heart of Germany,

104
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,352
cut off from our families by the front,

105
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,658
and here's a can of peas,
direct from Paris.

106
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,164
Is it all right?

107
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:08,506
I'm amazed at how honest
our jailers are with our parcels.

108
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:12,777
It's true!
Take our feldwebel, Arthur...

109
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:18,042
He eats cabbage every day.
It sticks in his craw. He told me so.

110
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:23,282
He'd much rather lay into your peas.

111
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:25,446
Don't kid yourselves.

112
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,817
If they did that,
our parcels would stop coming.

113
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:32,021
They're short of food for themselves.

114
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:34,325
Hurry, our guests will be hungry.

115
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:39,330
This tastes like an old sock!

116
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,631
What do they feed the French?

117
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:44,902
Cabbage, but they have their parcels.

118
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:48,374
- And the Russians?
- Cabbage roots, but no parcels.

119
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:49,981
And the English?

120
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:55,414
I was on the stage before the war...

121
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:56,919
in vaudeville.

122
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:01,925
- Ever see me?
- Theater's too deep for me.

123
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,653
I prefer bicycling.

124
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,593
You follow the Tour de France?

125
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,995
You must've heard of Fabert,
Garrigoud, Petit Breton...

126
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,775
Can we purchase what we like?

127
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,912
Yes, through the canteen.

128
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,708
Fine, I'll buy myself
a comfortable armchair...

129
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,879
playing cards, a few books,
English cigarettes.

130
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:28,577
You won't fiind those.

131
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,516
There you go, sir.
I'll come again tomorrow.

132
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:38,129
Gentlemen, time to eat.

133
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:43,967
Sir...

134
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,635
So, gentlemen,
what shall we begin with?

135
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:53,642
Chicken, foie gras,

136
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:55,906
or Captain Cook mackerel?

137
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:57,773
You're well provisioned.

138
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,043
Don't they feed us here?

139
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:04,421
In theory, they do,
but what they give us is inedible.

140
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,224
Fortunately, we have our parcels,
especially our friend Rosenthal's.

141
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:10,657
Oh, please!

142
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,663
A cognac to start with, sir?

143
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,960
I've never eaten so well in my life.

144
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:18,501
Some fish?

145
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:22,168
I'm getting used to
Rosenthal's kindness.

146
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:25,174
Man is such an adaptable creature.

147
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:28,177
You can see he's a professor...

148
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:30,440
Profess her... Confess her...

149
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,915
Address her... undress her...

150
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:35,584
Oops, a slip!

151
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,655
You're quite a joker!

152
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,348
Is that supposed to be witty?

153
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,594
He's hard to please!

154
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:45,623
Let's drink to peace!

155
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:46,854
Not bad, this cognac.

156
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:49,831
Comes from Fouquet's
in mouthwash bottles.

157
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:51,435
Fouquet's?

158
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:54,606
It's a bar on the Champs-Elysées.

159
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:59,609
When I went to Paris, I ate
at my brother-in-law's. It's cheaper.

160
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:02,710
- Been to Paris lately?
- Last week.

161
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:05,212
Lucky man! Places crowded?

162
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,875
Maxim's was packed.

163
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:10,451
I never go to places like that...

164
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:14,558
I prefer a nice little bar...
with good wine.

165
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:19,025
- Maxim's... don't know it either.
- It's no great loss.

166
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,031
We know you eat
at your brother-in-law's...

167
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:29,007
He never lets up!

168
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:34,376
Is he there, "Mr. Monocle"?

169
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:35,411
No, he's not.

170
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:39,813
I've just been to the canteen.
It's about his armchair request...

171
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,043
Let him tighten his belt!

172
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:43,483
I'll tell him.

173
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,696
He's nice, the guy with the parcels.
Well off?

174
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:54,055
And how!
You know the Rosenthal bank?

175
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:56,860
His parents.

176
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:00,839
Am I tickling you?

177
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:04,002
- And what's he do?
- Runs a big fashion house.

178
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:07,703
Funny.
With his money, I wouldn't...

179
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,080
What do you do in civilian life?

180
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,948
I'm a engineer for the cadaster.

181
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:14,446
Sure, the cadaster...

182
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:20,283
just between us...
can we trust your pal, the Captain?

183
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:22,960
He may seem strange,
but he's okay.

184
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:25,097
You can trust him all right.

185
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:27,922
- It's all right, then.
- Why?

186
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,302
You see, after dark...
we're digging a tunnel.

187
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:32,526
What for?

188
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:34,138
To escape.

189
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:36,036
What do you dig with?

190
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:38,709
A coal shovel, old food cans...

191
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:42,305
I calculate
we should come up in a garden

192
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:45,644
behind those buildings there.
It's open country.

193
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:47,449
That's slow work.

194
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,556
We've been at it for two months.
just a few more weeks...

195
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:53,715
The war'll be over fiirst.

196
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,884
You're deluding yourself.

197
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:57,924
Think so?

198
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,388
Best to be prepared.

199
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:01,794
Where's the tunnel?

200
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:04,401
You'll see tonight, after roll call.

201
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:06,730
So you're digging a hole...

202
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:10,935
Like Monte Cristo. What a laugh!

203
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:15,140
- Thanks for the wash.
- You can't do it with your arm.

204
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,642
Mind if I ask you something?

205
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:18,909
Go ahead.

206
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:21,280
What's a "cadaster"?

207
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:25,615
- Maréchal.
- Present.

208
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,817
- Boeldieu.
- Captain de Boeldieu.

209
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,794
- Cartier.
- Here... we go again!

210
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,090
Good night, Arthur!

211
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,801
- Whose turn is it?
- Cartier's.

212
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:23,874
What's that for?

213
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:27,985
For breathing.
These are to extend the line.

214
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:29,416
And the bags?

215
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,351
For removing earth.

216
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,916
This is the alarm.

217
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,557
If I start to suffocate,
I yank on the string...

218
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,001
The can falls...

219
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,833
And the boys pull me out by the feet...

220
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,502
The feet...

221
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:55,736
What are you waiting for?

222
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:59,275
Watch me play the mole...

223
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:01,550
mol-asses!

224
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,757
Is the tunnel safe?

225
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:13,365
It's shored up with wood
from the theater.

226
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:15,056
And the earth?

227
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,134
Stuffed under the floorboards.

228
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:20,136
But there's not an inch of space left.

229
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:23,639
Now we fiill bags and empty them
during exercise.

230
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,414
Hear that?

231
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,251
I'm sure I heard something.

232
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:48,131
It's nothing.

233
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:50,329
Listen...

234
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:56,502
We'll send someone out
to check.

235
00:19:57,643 --> 00:20:01,135
You've got an innocent face.
Go take a peek outside.

236
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:03,677
I'll pretend to go to the latrine.

237
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:42,779
Say, Arthur, what happened?

238
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:45,389
The fellow tried to escape.

239
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:49,050
We caught him in the garden
behind those buildings...

240
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:50,727
We opened fire.

241
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:52,724
Behind the buildings?

242
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:55,230
- Is he dead?
- I think so.

243
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:58,000
And you, what are you doing out?

244
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:02,797
Going to the latrine.

245
00:21:46,885 --> 00:21:50,377
- What was it?
- Someone tried to escape.

246
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:53,889
He got as far as the garden
behind the buildings.

247
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:56,452
A sentry shot him.

248
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:58,461
He's dead.

249
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:00,796
The alarm!

250
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:11,107
- No answer.
- Pull him out.

251
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:10,528
Hurt bad?

252
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:19,003
Drink some cognac.

253
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:24,112
From Fouquet's.

254
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:34,555
Here's mud in your eye.
Don't drop the bottle.

255
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,825
Who goes down tomorrow?

256
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:42,827
You do, sir... if you don't mind.

257
00:23:43,502 --> 00:23:48,132
My pleasure. I understand
crawling is fine exercise.

258
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:54,268
I remind you it is strictly forbidden

259
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:58,177
to receive non-military clothing.

260
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:21,799
Good news?

261
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:27,371
It's from my aunt in Bordeaux.
People are swarming into town.

262
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,141
What do you think?

263
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:30,941
They'd better watch out,

264
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,710
the Germans are claiming
a major breakthrough.

265
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:37,549
There's been no bell-ringing
so it can't mean much.

266
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:39,122
Up for some gardening?

267
00:24:44,997 --> 00:24:47,989
I hate the way
German bulletins exaggerate.

268
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,657
And our papers don't?

269
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:52,736
Remember the "Russian steamroller"?

270
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:57,499
Isn't it time we got down
to serious business?

271
00:24:57,776 --> 00:24:59,573
Sure, but not all at once.

272
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,888
And that famous General "Winter,"

273
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:46,786
so lethal to the nasty Krauts

274
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,223
but so tonic to the Allies...

275
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:52,955
And do you remember "Turpinite"?

276
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:58,467
A flask the size of... a radish
that could blow up a whole battalion.

277
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:02,801
They even tried it on a flock of sheep.

278
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:05,239
Too bad they didn't stop at that.

279
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:18,020
- What're you guys planting?
- Dandelions.

280
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,522
I'm dreaming of dandelion salad.

281
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:23,991
The war'll be over
before your dandelions grow.

282
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,428
This singular exercise
will give us workman's hands.

283
00:26:29,668 --> 00:26:31,101
The trunks are here!

284
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,669
- The costumes?
- At the theater.

285
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:36,239
There should be a trunk
with women's clothes.

286
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:38,031
Coming, sir?

287
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,010
My theatrical skills are questionable.
Besides, I'm engaged.

288
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,274
- Playing patience?
- Exactly. I'm a realist.

289
00:27:30,762 --> 00:27:32,889
Find anything, Arthur?

290
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:34,925
Nothing.

291
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:38,293
Well, gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.

292
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:47,969
Where will we put all this?

293
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:50,239
I asked for hangers.

294
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:54,642
Be careful...

295
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,955
These things
should be handled with care...

296
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,613
with your eyes closed.

297
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,291
Looks like a little girl's dress.

298
00:28:03,462 --> 00:28:05,692
Dresses are short now.

299
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:09,191
just below the knee.

300
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:11,799
So I hear. I'd love to see that!

301
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,267
Then put it on.

302
00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:15,804
Not him, he never shaves.

303
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:19,876
- You have an angel face, Maisonneuve.
- Anything to amuse.

304
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:24,043
We have to take inventory.

305
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:28,649
The corset, too!

306
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,048
Take it easy.

307
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:33,382
It's not only the dresses.
They wear their hair short, too.

308
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:34,855
Short hair!

309
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,487
It's like sleeping with a boy!

310
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:40,563
When we're not around,
women act foolish.

311
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:43,360
I'm sure my wife hasn't cut her hair.

312
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:45,969
That's for high-class floozies.

313
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:48,138
How would you know,
with that mug?

314
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:50,968
- Shoes!
- How small they are!

315
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:52,337
Stockings.

316
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:56,072
Stockings of sheerest silk!

317
00:28:56,248 --> 00:28:58,580
Hey, fellas, I'm ready!

318
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:01,149
Let us dream a bit first.

319
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:03,844
You'll only stifle our imagination.

320
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:05,984
Look at that!

321
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:07,420
Black stockings!

322
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:14,588
Looks like a real girl!

323
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:16,165
Funny, huh?

324
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:18,366
Doesn't it look funny?

325
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:36,349
Yeah, sure looks funny.

326
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:52,966
Poor boys.

327
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,824
Enjoy yourselves.

328
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:37,246
Out there, children play soldier...

329
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,580
In here, soldiers play like children.

330
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:45,087
I wish I knew what's going on
back home.

331
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:48,650
- No news?
- Nothing.

332
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:51,193
I don't care what my missus is up to.

333
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:57,097
I want out
'cause I'm bored stiff... bored!

334
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:02,803
So you want to escape for the fun ofit.

335
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:03,770
Right!

336
00:31:03,975 --> 00:31:06,466
For me, it's the spirit
of contradiction.

337
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:09,776
They won't let me fiight,
so I'm dying to.

338
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:13,850
I hate being here
when others are biting the dust.

339
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:15,486
For me it's simple.

340
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:19,385
A golf course is for golf.
A tennis court for tennis.

341
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:22,152
A prison camp is for escaping.

342
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:24,352
And you, Rosenthal, the sportsman...

343
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:27,123
Him? He was born in Jerusalem.

344
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:32,532
No, in Vienna. To a Danish mother
and a Polish father, naturalized French.

345
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:34,896
Old Celtic aristocracy!

346
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:40,342
Yet for all your French roots, none
of you owns an acre ofyour country.

347
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:43,640
In 35 years,
the Rosenthals have acquired

348
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:46,545
three chateaux with hunting preserves,

349
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:49,481
farms, orchards, warrens, stud farms,

350
00:31:49,654 --> 00:31:52,248
and 3 galleries of bona fiide ancestors.

351
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:55,518
If that's not worth escaping
to fight for!

352
00:31:55,694 --> 00:32:00,427
I'd never considered patriotism
from such an unusual angle.

353
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:02,758
With all those game preserves,

354
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:05,835
your lackeys must
really stuff themselves.

355
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:08,562
I got into the war in a funny way.

356
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:12,536
I became a soldier
because I'm a vegetarian.

357
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:17,940
That's right.
My brother and I had stomach ailments.

358
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:21,415
The doctor warned us
against eating meat.

359
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:24,411
I turned vegetarian and got well.

360
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:27,247
My brother went on eating meat,

361
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:30,861
got sick and was invalided out.

362
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:35,089
Your citations show vegetarianism
didn't interfere with duty.

363
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,927
Or stop my wife from cheating on me.

364
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:44,300
You have to admit it's stirring.

365
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,585
I loathe fifes.

366
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:03,326
Still, it gets to you.

367
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:06,991
It's not the music that gets to you...

368
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,397
It's the marching feet.

369
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:24,471
Thanks to your dumb talk
I ruined my pants...

370
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:46,629
FORT DOUAUMONT TAKEN!

371
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:20,661
What about our show?
Do we still put it on?

372
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,467
You bet we do!
All the more reason.

373
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:26,836
In fact we should invite
the German Officers.

374
00:34:27,078 --> 00:34:31,811
Although I won't join
in your artistic endeavors, Maréchal,

375
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:35,545
let me congratulateyou...
That's the spirit!

376
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,176
Have you met Marguerite
She's neither tall nor petite

377
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:10,287
With eyes that glow, skin like snow
And lips in a cupid's bow

378
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:14,686
Well, when this divine creation
Heard my ardent declaration

379
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:18,590
She gave me a rose, tweaked my nose
Saying, "I'll give you joy"

380
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:22,856
I said, "Thanks all the same
But that's not why I came"

381
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:26,731
If you want to give me joy

382
00:35:26,905 --> 00:35:30,272
Marguerite, Marguerite

383
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:33,969
If you want to give me joy

384
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:38,140
Make me your loverboy

385
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:41,048
'Neath her window I waited

386
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:43,049
And then I serenaded::

387
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:47,623
"My soul's apyre
since your eyes set my heart on fire!"

388
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:51,761
So this sweet and caring dame
To put out my raging flame

389
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:56,566
Did a bucket spill from her sill
Asking, "Is it burning still?"

390
00:35:56,734 --> 00:36:01,398
I said, "Thanks all the same
But that's not why I came"

391
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:12,776
If you want to give me joy

392
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:16,476
Marguerite, let me be your loverboy

393
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:18,244
All together now!

394
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:58,262
And now... direct from Paris!

395
00:38:22,513 --> 00:38:24,447
Get it, Arthur?

396
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,260
Stop the show! Stop the show!

397
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:41,393
Stop, fellas!

398
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:45,267
We've retaken Douaumont!
It's in the German papers.

399
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,855
A little hole, to escape.

400
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:05,004
GERMAN TROOPS
RECAPTURE DOUAUMONT

401
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:10,574
Isn't that awful?

402
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:12,579
Can't be much left of it!

403
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:53,954
Get off my back!
I can't take it any more! I'm fed up!

404
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,821
I want to see some light!

405
00:41:56,994 --> 00:42:00,657
It stinks of shit in here!
Hear me? It stinks of shit!

406
00:42:00,832 --> 00:42:02,959
And I want to hear a voice.

407
00:42:09,006 --> 00:42:12,442
I want to hear a French voice.

408
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:29,085
What was he yelling about?

409
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:33,847
The war's too long.

410
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:46,399
If my calculations are right,

411
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:50,370
we should be under the garden wall
in four days.

412
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:54,607
That's a lot of dirt!

413
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,013
Now that we may get away

414
00:43:57,181 --> 00:44:01,015
and reach home again,
I'm afraid of what's waiting for me.

415
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:03,745
There's more than one woman on earth!

416
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,115
Not for me.

417
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:07,348
That's why she cheats on you.

418
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:11,558
One thing upsets me:
leaving Maréchal behind.

419
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:14,026
It weighs on me as well.

420
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:16,894
In fact... it disturbs me.

421
00:44:19,236 --> 00:44:22,069
But that's war. No room for sentiment.

422
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:35,581
Glad to seeyou, old man.

423
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:38,119
We are, too.
Wait until you hear why.

424
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:39,722
You old dog!

425
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:43,420
Got anything to eat? I'm hungry.

426
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,962
Have a seat.
Rosenthal's getting some grub ready.

427
00:44:57,641 --> 00:44:58,903
What time is it?

428
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:01,175
11 o'clock.

429
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:04,472
Time's dragging today.

430
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:07,981
Sure, but tonight it's aufwiedersehen!

431
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:10,451
So, we meet in Amsterdam?

432
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:13,954
I'm keen to see Holland,
for the tulips.

433
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:18,824
What about the cheese?
Don'tyou like Dutch cheese?

434
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:23,433
Sure, but they say the tulip fiields
stretch for miles.

435
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:26,295
You have the instincts of a shop girl.

436
00:45:31,842 --> 00:45:33,833
Assembly at three o'clock.

437
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:36,172
All Officers are to change camps.

438
00:45:36,347 --> 00:45:38,042
Get your things ready.

439
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:01,964
Gentlemen,
I wish you a pleasant journey.

440
00:46:02,306 --> 00:46:06,072
I hope you will see
your wives again soon.

441
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:30,599
We ought to alert them.

442
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:34,564
About the tunnel.

443
00:46:51,422 --> 00:46:53,913
Sir, there's a tunnel in Barrack 7.

444
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:29,378
Open the window.
It stinks in here!

445
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:43,959
Sir, may I point out there are
only two pairs of white gloves left.

446
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:47,862
We can't get any gloves here.

447
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:50,695
Try to make them last.

448
00:49:50,868 --> 00:49:53,928
Yes, sir... More coffee, sir?

449
00:49:56,073 --> 00:49:59,600
If you call this muck coffee,
I have to accept it.

450
00:50:00,944 --> 00:50:03,742
At least it warms my insides.

451
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,945
The list of new prisoners, sir.

452
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:55,593
Three new officer POWs reporting, sir!

453
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:06,002
Delighted to see you again, Boeldieu.

454
00:51:10,681 --> 00:51:13,206
But I'm sorry to see you here.

455
00:51:13,817 --> 00:51:15,011
We feel the same.

456
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:19,318
Sit down, gentlemen.

457
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:21,185
No, thank you, sir.

458
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:22,985
As you wish.

459
00:51:33,537 --> 00:51:35,505
Captain de Boeldieu,

460
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,004
four escape attempts:

461
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:43,640
Through a heating duct,
in a garbage bin,

462
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:47,515
via the sewers,
in a laundry basket.

463
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:49,911
One must lower oneself,
at times.

464
00:51:50,754 --> 00:51:52,346
I understand.

465
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,849
Lieutenant Maréchal,
five attempts at escape:

466
00:51:57,494 --> 00:51:59,519
Disguised as a chimney sweep...

467
00:51:59,763 --> 00:52:02,323
Correction, sir:
heating engineer.

468
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:04,761
Disguised as a German soldier,

469
00:52:04,935 --> 00:52:06,903
disguised as a woman.

470
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:09,730
Amusing, very amusing.

471
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:15,502
But less so when an NCO
tried to pick me up. That I didn't like!

472
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:17,273
Indeed?

473
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:19,173
I assure you.

474
00:52:20,884 --> 00:52:23,876
Lieutenant Demolder,
three attempts...

475
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:32,460
Gentlemen, I respect
your patriotism and courage.

476
00:52:34,231 --> 00:52:39,100
But the situation
is completely different here.

477
00:52:40,571 --> 00:52:43,335
No one escapes from this fortress.

478
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:46,308
You understand me, don't you?

479
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:53,112
So as not to be accused
of German barbarism,

480
00:52:54,017 --> 00:52:57,453
I have decided to apply
French regulations.

481
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:05,326
Look them over.

482
00:53:05,729 --> 00:53:09,221
They make good bedtime reading.

483
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:18,464
And now, gentlemen,
if you will follow me...

484
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,869
Oswald! My coat.

485
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:41,988
My soldiers aren't young,

486
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:45,657
but they enjoy playing soldier.

487
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:08,451
We have 25 more guns like this one.

488
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:14,353
I suppose you know the Maxim gun?

489
00:54:14,531 --> 00:54:15,964
Very well, sir.

490
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:19,530
But I prefer the restaurant.

491
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:21,193
Touché!

492
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:40,583
12th century.

493
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:56,505
Excuse me, sir...

494
00:54:56,807 --> 00:55:01,107
Was this villa built specially
for Captain de Boeldieu and myself?

495
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,014
Are we your only boarders?

496
00:55:08,485 --> 00:55:12,080
Your comrades are back there.

497
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:18,155
13th century.

498
00:55:36,046 --> 00:55:38,514
A 120-foot drop.

499
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:45,014
So kind of you
to show us around the grounds.

500
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:47,156
It's such a nice castle, sir.

501
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:50,492
It's so old...

502
00:55:53,497 --> 00:55:54,896
And so cheerful.

503
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:09,311
Sorry I can't give you
a room to yourself.

504
00:56:09,479 --> 00:56:12,539
I'm touched,
but I'd never have accepted.

505
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,413
I hope our walk
didn't weary you too much.

506
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:21,716
Not at all, sir, we're fiine.

507
00:56:34,237 --> 00:56:36,865
- 14th century.
- Pure Gothic.

508
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:41,509
Ifyou don't mind, gentlemen...

509
00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:47,681
Your friend Lt. Rosenthal,
from the Hallbach camp, is here.

510
00:56:48,618 --> 00:56:52,281
- Not old Rosenthal!
- He wasn't any luckier.

511
00:56:53,757 --> 00:56:57,022
The commandant has put you all
in the same room.

512
00:56:57,194 --> 00:57:00,095
That way you'll eat better.

513
00:57:00,597 --> 00:57:02,588
That's very nice of him.

514
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:06,696
A mere formality.

515
00:57:20,484 --> 00:57:22,918
- I caught it with a brunette.
- Who can you trust?

516
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:27,216
A friend of my mother's.
Quite respectable. She did charity work.

517
00:57:27,524 --> 00:57:30,459
In good society it's usually the pox.

518
00:57:30,627 --> 00:57:31,685
Right, Boeldieu?

519
00:57:31,895 --> 00:57:36,059
The pox used to be our privilege.
But we've lost it.

520
00:57:36,233 --> 00:57:37,791
Like so many others.

521
00:57:38,235 --> 00:57:39,759
Everything is popularized.

522
00:57:39,936 --> 00:57:44,032
Cancer and gout
aren't working-class diseases,

523
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:46,437
but they will be, believe me.

524
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,405
How about intellectuals?

525
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:50,569
With us it's tuberculosis.

526
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:52,442
Here's Mr. Pindar.

527
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:54,106
And the middle class?

528
00:57:54,284 --> 00:57:57,310
Liver and intestinal ailments...
They eat too much.

529
00:57:57,487 --> 00:58:00,285
We'd each die
ofour own class diseases,

530
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:03,449
if war didn't make all germs equal.

531
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,053
Your dictionaries are in myway.

532
00:58:06,229 --> 00:58:07,560
Excuse me,

533
00:58:07,731 --> 00:58:11,167
but Pindar has always been
so badly translated.

534
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:13,928
A lamentable oversight.
I'm so sorry.

535
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:18,505
Not that I care,
but who's this guy Pindar?

536
00:58:18,675 --> 00:58:22,236
Go on,joke! But Pindar
means more to me than anything...

537
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:24,675
More than you, the war, my life!

538
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:28,583
Pindar is the greatest Greek poet.

539
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:31,146
The greatest Greek poet?

540
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:33,450
You don't say...

541
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:38,252
There! My map'sjust about finished.

542
00:58:39,763 --> 00:58:42,254
See... this is where we are...

543
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:47,159
16 miles above this bend
in the Main River.

544
00:58:47,337 --> 00:58:50,636
To reach Switzerland
above Lake Constance

545
00:58:50,807 --> 00:58:54,299
and avoid the Rhine,
we'd have to travel...

546
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:57,278
- 200 miles.
- No kidding!

547
00:58:57,447 --> 00:59:02,680
That means walking 15 nights on 6 lumps
of sugar and 2 biscuits a day.

548
00:59:03,954 --> 00:59:08,721
You and your map, you're as crazy
as him and his Pindar. To escape...

549
00:59:08,892 --> 00:59:11,326
There! My picture's finished.

550
00:59:12,696 --> 00:59:14,721
"Justice Pursuing Crime. "

551
00:59:15,031 --> 00:59:16,828
It came out all right.

552
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:22,195
Look, to reach this Constance place...

553
00:59:28,378 --> 00:59:29,902
Will it hold?

554
00:59:30,413 --> 00:59:33,541
It can hold 10 of you and 5 like me.

555
00:59:35,518 --> 00:59:37,486
They're searching the rooms!

556
00:59:41,157 --> 00:59:44,058
- Under the mattress, quick!
- No, under mine!

557
00:59:44,227 --> 00:59:45,922
That won't do.

558
00:59:46,529 --> 00:59:47,996
It's childish.

559
00:59:48,665 --> 00:59:49,927
May I?

560
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,702
Now there's an idea!

561
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:04,106
A convenient little gutter.

562
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:07,777
Here they are!

563
01:00:11,955 --> 01:00:14,423
Gentlemen... inspection.

564
01:00:25,235 --> 01:00:27,100
"Louise wrote to Victor:

565
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:31,707
I am as weary as a girl
after 22 nights oflove. "

566
01:00:33,076 --> 01:00:35,408
22 nights oflove, imagine that!

567
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:09,302
Continue!

568
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,946
Not that corner!

569
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:30,098
Give me your word that you've nothing
in here against regulations.

570
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:33,129
You have my word.

571
01:01:33,803 --> 01:01:36,704
But why my word and not theirs?

572
01:01:38,675 --> 01:01:40,666
The word of a...

573
01:01:41,978 --> 01:01:43,502
Rosenthal...

574
01:01:44,381 --> 01:01:46,645
and a Maréchal?

575
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,051
It's as good as ours.

576
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:52,143
Perhaps.

577
01:01:59,562 --> 01:02:02,759
No, not that!

578
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:04,830
It's very rare.

579
01:02:17,347 --> 01:02:19,679
Poor old Pindar!

580
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:23,344
They really are stupid.

581
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:41,768
Everything go all right in here?

582
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:45,237
- Not bad.
- For us, too.

583
01:03:04,227 --> 01:03:07,094
And how is your cousin,
Edmond de Boeldieu,

584
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,323
the military attaché I met in Berlin?

585
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,468
He's doing well. He's very happy.

586
01:03:12,635 --> 01:03:15,399
He lost an arm
and married a rich woman.

587
01:03:15,772 --> 01:03:18,240
A truly fine career.

588
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,478
Recognize her?

589
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:38,589
Sit down.

590
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:41,092
Let me tell you something...

591
01:03:42,298 --> 01:03:43,822
Believe me,

592
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:46,866
my present functions

593
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:49,495
revolt me as much as they do you.

594
01:03:50,673 --> 01:03:51,765
That's being harsh.

595
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:54,135
I used to be a combatant.

596
01:03:54,444 --> 01:03:58,938
Now I'm a bureaucrat, a policeman.

597
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,441
But it's the only way

598
01:04:02,886 --> 01:04:05,684
I can still appear to be

599
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:09,049
serving my fatherland.

600
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:13,959
I have burns all over...
That explains my gloves.

601
01:04:15,498 --> 01:04:18,626
My spine is fractured in two places.

602
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:21,331
A silver plate.

603
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:24,698
In my kneecap, too.

604
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:31,709
I owe these riches
to the misfortunes ofwar.

605
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:34,740
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course.

606
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:38,382
Why did you make

607
01:04:39,222 --> 01:04:40,712
an exception ofme

608
01:04:41,257 --> 01:04:42,815
by inviting me here?

609
01:04:43,493 --> 01:04:47,987
Because your name is Boeldieu,
career offiicer in the French Army.

610
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:53,059
And I am Rauffenstein, career offiicer
in the German Imperial Army.

611
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:55,929
But my comrades are Officers, as well.

612
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:00,141
A Maréchal and a Rosenthal, Officers?

613
01:05:00,443 --> 01:05:02,070
They're fine soldiers.

614
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:05,076
Charming legacy
of the French Revolution.

615
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:10,477
Neither you nor I
can stop the march of time.

616
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:11,984
Boeldieu...

617
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:15,949
I don't know who will win this war,

618
01:05:16,426 --> 01:05:18,758
but whatever the outcome,

619
01:05:18,962 --> 01:05:22,955
it will mean the end of
the Rauffensteins and the Boeldieus.

620
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,860
We're no longer needed.

621
01:05:25,168 --> 01:05:27,432
Isn't that a pity?

622
01:05:27,637 --> 01:05:29,002
Perhaps.

623
01:05:33,176 --> 01:05:36,145
I admire the way
you tend your geranium.

624
01:05:36,346 --> 01:05:39,509
Don't think I've become a botanist,

625
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:43,613
but it's the only flower
in the fortress.

626
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:49,617
Nothing grows here but ivy and nettles.

627
01:05:50,693 --> 01:05:52,957
I'm glad I'm leaving with you.

628
01:05:53,129 --> 01:05:54,187
With us.

629
01:05:54,697 --> 01:05:57,325
Sure, I like Boeldieu, but...

630
01:05:59,135 --> 01:06:00,568
With him...

631
01:06:02,372 --> 01:06:04,863
I never really feel at ease.

632
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:09,206
Different backgrounds...
There's a wall between us.

633
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:10,676
He's a terrifiic guy.

634
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:13,407
Sure, and he's on the level, but...

635
01:06:14,217 --> 01:06:17,675
Suppose you and I were on the skids.

636
01:06:17,854 --> 01:06:19,253
We'd just be two bums.

637
01:06:19,422 --> 01:06:21,083
If it happened to him,

638
01:06:21,257 --> 01:06:24,658
he'd still be " Monsieur de Boeldieu. "

639
01:06:24,827 --> 01:06:26,761
Anyway, you've been terrifiic, too,

640
01:06:26,929 --> 01:06:29,693
feeding us with your parcels.

641
01:06:29,866 --> 01:06:31,561
That's all vanity.

642
01:06:31,734 --> 01:06:34,931
I'm really proud to come
from a rich family.

643
01:06:35,104 --> 01:06:39,097
Inviting you to my table
is myway ofshowing it.

644
01:06:39,342 --> 01:06:41,537
Most people think we're stingy.

645
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:44,043
Wrong. We're often generous.

646
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:46,909
Unfortunately, along with that quality,

647
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:49,847
Jehovah gave us an overdose of pride.

648
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:52,579
To hell with Jehovah!

649
01:06:52,755 --> 01:06:55,223
All I know is you've been a real pal.

650
01:07:01,898 --> 01:07:03,889
We've received a large crate,

651
01:07:04,067 --> 01:07:06,399
a gift from our Czarina.

652
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:10,136
Please come and share it with us.

653
01:07:10,306 --> 01:07:13,366
From the Czarina? Must be caviar.

654
01:07:13,543 --> 01:07:17,035
- Coming, Boeldieu? They've got vodka.
- Vodka? Lead on.

655
01:07:22,218 --> 01:07:25,745
Now we can pay you back
for all your kindness.

656
01:07:25,922 --> 01:07:29,790
The Czarina is always good-hearted.

657
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:32,120
Quite a lady, your Czarina.

658
01:07:50,313 --> 01:07:52,508
Think of what's in store!

659
01:08:09,031 --> 01:08:12,990
"Principles ofAlgebra"...
"Elementary Ethics"... "Grammar"...

660
01:08:13,169 --> 01:08:14,636
A cook book!

661
01:08:14,804 --> 01:08:17,170
Something to sink your teeth into!

662
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:19,502
What a farce!

663
01:08:19,675 --> 01:08:21,836
Let's go before something happens.

664
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:24,472
Goodbye, thanks anyway.

665
01:08:45,735 --> 01:08:49,330
- The Cossacks aren't happy!
- Let's get out of here!

666
01:08:53,743 --> 01:08:56,075
You have no right to burn books!

667
01:08:56,245 --> 01:08:58,304
It's crazy sending us books!

668
01:09:13,763 --> 01:09:16,425
The sentries are busy with the Russians.

669
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:19,329
It's a long drop here,
but it's unguarded.

670
01:09:19,502 --> 01:09:22,699
If only we'd been ready!
What a chance!

671
01:09:22,872 --> 01:09:25,773
- Especially at night!
- We'll try again.

672
01:09:26,776 --> 01:09:29,904
It was kind ofthem
to hold a rehearsal for us.

673
01:09:30,513 --> 01:09:34,711
Now we know if one man
can divert them for 5 minutes,

674
01:09:35,084 --> 01:09:36,574
his comrades can escape.

675
01:09:36,752 --> 01:09:39,346
- Too risky!
- You're exaggerating.

676
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:43,582
It would amuse me.

677
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:46,188
When do you want to go?

678
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:49,262
Why us? You're in it, too.

679
01:09:52,468 --> 01:09:54,459
Why not? Don't you trust us?

680
01:09:55,705 --> 01:09:58,572
- That wouldn't stop me.
- Well then?

681
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:01,877
A plan like yours
can only work with two men.

682
01:10:02,445 --> 01:10:04,436
And I know your preference.

683
01:10:04,614 --> 01:10:07,082
- It's not fair.
- What's fair in war?

684
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,218
We can't accept that.

685
01:10:09,385 --> 01:10:11,216
I'm not asking you...

686
01:10:11,787 --> 01:10:13,118
I'm telling you.

687
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:17,915
The arts aren't forbidden here.

688
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:19,391
You like music?

689
01:10:19,562 --> 01:10:21,792
So-so... I like a good waltz.

690
01:10:21,964 --> 01:10:23,431
I love the flute.

691
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:26,966
Here's the program:
We buy flutes for everyone.

692
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:30,801
On the given day:
concert in all the rooms at 5 p. m.

693
01:10:30,973 --> 01:10:32,770
That's when night falls.

694
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:36,002
Five minutes later,
they confiiscate our flutes.

695
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:38,170
At 5:15,

696
01:10:38,748 --> 01:10:41,581
another concert
with anything at hand:

697
01:10:42,151 --> 01:10:44,085
saucepans, animal noises,

698
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,818
grinding teeth, whatever...

699
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,982
Result: assembly in the courtyard.

700
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,354
Then what?

701
01:10:54,797 --> 01:10:57,823
That's my concern.
You'll have fiive minutes...

702
01:10:59,268 --> 01:11:01,828
to clear the walls and reach the woods.

703
01:11:02,672 --> 01:11:04,299
Look, Boeldieu,

704
01:11:04,874 --> 01:11:08,366
I don't know how to put it,
but I feel awful about this.

705
01:11:08,544 --> 01:11:10,876
- Come now!
- Yes, awful.

706
01:11:14,617 --> 01:11:16,380
I'd like to say something...

707
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:19,644
Pour some warm water
over my gloves, will you?

708
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:25,855
Whatever happens,
I want you to know that...

709
01:11:26,028 --> 01:11:29,054
I'm not doing this for you personally.

710
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:32,462
So we needn't get mawkish.

711
01:11:33,869 --> 01:11:35,063
Go on.

712
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:38,404
But there are times in life...

713
01:11:38,574 --> 01:11:40,701
Let's avoid them, shall we?

714
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:43,972
Excuse me...

715
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:55,850
So you'll be wearing those?

716
01:11:56,025 --> 01:11:57,424
Any objections?

717
01:11:57,593 --> 01:12:01,927
No, but white gloves
for this sort of thing, what an idea!

718
01:12:02,098 --> 01:12:03,861
To each his own style.

719
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:10,437
You can't do anything
like other people.

720
01:12:11,407 --> 01:12:13,932
We've been together
eighteen months,

721
01:12:14,343 --> 01:12:16,208
and you still stand on ceremony.

722
01:12:16,379 --> 01:12:19,940
I'm the same with my mother
and my wife.

723
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:23,613
In that case...

724
01:12:26,789 --> 01:12:30,122
No thanks, English tobacco
gives me a sore throat.

725
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:34,024
No doubt about it: gloves, tobacco...

726
01:12:35,064 --> 01:12:36,861
We've got nothing in common.

727
01:12:40,302 --> 01:12:41,701
Say what you like,

728
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:45,901
but where there are Germans,
there is order.

729
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:50,136
Sure, the old man is a bit mad

730
01:12:50,312 --> 01:12:52,803
with his flower pot and all...

731
01:12:53,082 --> 01:12:57,212
A good thing I'm here
to keep those scoundrels in check.

732
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,981
I was a teacher back home.

733
01:13:19,508 --> 01:13:23,774
Lieutenant, confiscate
those damned flutes at once!

734
01:14:35,251 --> 01:14:37,242
I advise you not to start again!

735
01:14:38,354 --> 01:14:40,549
We'll do just that in 15 minutes.

736
01:14:54,603 --> 01:14:56,901
Order executed, sir.

737
01:15:06,382 --> 01:15:09,579
You see? It worked.

738
01:15:09,952 --> 01:15:14,252
Put them on bread and water
for three days. And no parcels.

739
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:17,416
Ready, boys... Two seconds...

740
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:33,632
Assembly!

741
01:16:37,706 --> 01:16:40,140
I understand my students now.
What a lark!

742
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:42,004
While it lasts.

743
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:46,671
Well...

744
01:16:47,883 --> 01:16:49,009
What?

745
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,309
Goodbye.

746
01:17:49,511 --> 01:17:50,705
Boeldieu!

747
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:54,538
De Boeldieu!

748
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:27,789
Listen!

749
01:22:29,024 --> 01:22:30,685
I beg you! Come down!

750
01:23:32,854 --> 01:23:36,051
Lieutenants Maréchal and Rosenthal
have escaped.

751
01:23:45,534 --> 01:23:47,092
So that's why.

752
01:23:51,606 --> 01:23:53,369
Search lights!

753
01:23:54,142 --> 01:23:56,440
Send out patrols with dogs!

754
01:23:57,045 --> 01:24:00,446
Alert all military
and civil authorities!

755
01:24:01,216 --> 01:24:03,741
Report back to me every quarter hour!

756
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:55,294
Your orders have been carried out, sir.

757
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:57,495
No sign of the fugitives yet.

758
01:25:39,548 --> 01:25:41,607
Forgive me.

759
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:46,016
I would have done the same.

760
01:25:46,655 --> 01:25:50,785
French or German, duty is duty.

761
01:25:53,462 --> 01:25:55,020
Are you in pain?

762
01:25:57,332 --> 01:26:00,790
I didn't think
a bullet in the stomach hurt so much.

763
01:26:01,369 --> 01:26:03,496
I aimed at your legs.

764
01:26:05,674 --> 01:26:08,643
It was 500 feet, with poor visibility...

765
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:13,079
Besides, I was running.

766
01:26:14,649 --> 01:26:16,844
Please, no excuses.

767
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:19,213
I was clumsy.

768
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:25,423
I'm not the one to be pitied.

769
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:28,154
For me it will all be over...

770
01:26:28,997 --> 01:26:30,328
soon.

771
01:26:32,501 --> 01:26:34,731
But you'll have to carry on.

772
01:26:36,705 --> 01:26:41,335
Carry on a futile existence.

773
01:26:44,379 --> 01:26:47,906
For a commoner,
dying in a war is a tragedy.

774
01:26:49,451 --> 01:26:52,682
But for you and me,

775
01:26:54,189 --> 01:26:55,918
it's a good way out.

776
01:26:57,025 --> 01:26:58,617
I missed my chance.

777
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:04,565
You shouldn't be talking so much.

778
01:27:28,557 --> 01:27:29,717
Sir...

779
01:29:15,397 --> 01:29:18,264
We should've avoided the road.

780
01:29:19,234 --> 01:29:21,065
We couldn't sleep in the reeds.

781
01:29:22,904 --> 01:29:24,235
He's gone.

782
01:29:25,974 --> 01:29:28,101
Didn't you see it was a woman?

783
01:29:28,276 --> 01:29:30,403
- Let's get going.
- Wait till dark.

784
01:29:30,578 --> 01:29:32,808
I'm freezing, I have to move.

785
01:29:45,794 --> 01:29:47,159
Want your sugar?

786
01:29:49,798 --> 01:29:51,459
There's not much left.

787
01:29:51,633 --> 01:29:53,260
And we've a long way to go.

788
01:29:53,435 --> 01:29:57,701
- What about you?
- I ate mine, I was hungry.

789
01:29:58,673 --> 01:30:01,198
You keep it, so I won't be tempted.

790
01:30:01,376 --> 01:30:04,277
You poor thing...
You ate your buttons, too?

791
01:30:04,446 --> 01:30:05,879
Does it show?

792
01:30:07,782 --> 01:30:10,342
So we're not waiting till dark?

793
01:30:10,518 --> 01:30:12,884
No, we'll skirt the village fiirst.

794
01:30:15,957 --> 01:30:17,288
Your foot hurt?

795
01:30:17,459 --> 01:30:19,017
It's nothing... a nerve.

796
01:30:41,716 --> 01:30:42,876
Let's go.

797
01:30:49,991 --> 01:30:51,390
You coming?

798
01:31:17,218 --> 01:31:18,947
You coming or what?

799
01:31:25,193 --> 01:31:26,683
I'm doing the best I can.

800
01:31:42,544 --> 01:31:43,909
You and your foot!

801
01:31:44,078 --> 01:31:46,069
It's not my fault! I slipped.

802
01:31:46,314 --> 01:31:48,441
You slipped! That's all I hear.

803
01:31:48,616 --> 01:31:51,983
If you get us caught,
you'll explain you slipped?

804
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:55,485
We're out offood.
Might as well give up now.

805
01:31:55,657 --> 01:31:58,922
- Gladly. I've had enough too.
- Had enough ofme?

806
01:31:59,093 --> 01:32:02,756
Damn right! If you only knew
how you make me sick!

807
01:32:02,931 --> 01:32:05,957
Well, the feeling's mutual.

808
01:32:06,134 --> 01:32:09,467
You're a dead weight,
a ball and chain.

809
01:32:09,637 --> 01:32:11,605
I never could stomach Jews!

810
01:32:11,773 --> 01:32:15,607
A bit late to realize that!
Clear out, you're dying too.

811
01:32:15,777 --> 01:32:17,335
You said it!

812
01:32:17,512 --> 01:32:19,912
Get lost! I'm sick ofyour ugly mug!

813
01:32:20,081 --> 01:32:23,141
I'm going! You're on your own now!
So long!

814
01:32:23,318 --> 01:32:25,013
So long! Go ahead!

815
01:32:25,186 --> 01:32:27,677
I'm so happy I could sing...

816
01:32:27,856 --> 01:32:31,758
There once was a little steamboat

817
01:32:31,993 --> 01:32:33,984
Which had ne-ne-nevergone to sea

818
01:32:37,465 --> 01:32:40,093
After five or six weeks at sea

819
01:32:43,004 --> 01:32:46,030
The supplies
we real-al-almost gone for good...

820
01:33:04,392 --> 01:33:05,984
Why'd you come back?

821
01:33:09,063 --> 01:33:10,291
Come on.

822
01:33:18,006 --> 01:33:19,633
Let's go, fella.

823
01:33:34,555 --> 01:33:36,648
- Had enough?
- It's okay.

824
01:33:36,824 --> 01:33:40,055
- Want to rest in that shed there?
- Too risky.

825
01:33:40,228 --> 01:33:43,061
- I can't see any smoke.
- Even so...

826
01:33:43,231 --> 01:33:46,200
When the ship's on fiire,
you go overboard.

827
01:33:46,367 --> 01:33:48,426
Right. Overboard we go!

828
01:33:48,836 --> 01:33:50,167
Let's go, old man.

829
01:33:59,514 --> 01:34:02,540
- Someone's there.
- The window! Run for it.

830
01:34:02,717 --> 01:34:04,742
I'll draw them off.

831
01:34:04,919 --> 01:34:06,511
Don't move! Keep quiet.

832
01:34:09,123 --> 01:34:10,852
Stay where you are!

833
01:34:30,545 --> 01:34:31,739
French...

834
01:34:34,148 --> 01:34:35,445
We're not thieves.

835
01:34:41,055 --> 01:34:42,283
Prisoners of war?

836
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:46,216
You speak German?

837
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:52,791
I sprained my foot. We're exhausted.
We're not thieves.

838
01:34:54,002 --> 01:34:55,162
I'm not afraid.

839
01:34:55,436 --> 01:34:58,963
Go on, call the police.
I won't walk another step!

840
01:35:00,108 --> 01:35:01,598
You sprained your foot?

841
01:35:09,484 --> 01:35:11,577
She says to come into the house.

842
01:35:11,753 --> 01:35:14,017
No, I don't trust her.

843
01:35:19,627 --> 01:35:21,822
She says she's alone here.

844
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:11,538
She says her child's asleep,
so don't make any noise.

845
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,071
Come and sit down here.

846
01:36:19,187 --> 01:36:20,654
I'll be right back.

847
01:36:53,588 --> 01:36:55,453
Hungry? Yes.

848
01:36:55,723 --> 01:36:58,886
- She asked if you're hungry.
- Yeah, I understood.

849
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:15,971
What about you?

850
01:37:16,611 --> 01:37:18,545
I just want to sleep.

851
01:38:02,690 --> 01:38:05,488
Excuse me, but how far is Wölfiisheim?

852
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:06,854
Eight miles.

853
01:38:08,796 --> 01:38:11,697
I'd sooner stay here
than slog up there!

854
01:38:11,866 --> 01:38:15,859
But duty's duty.
Thanks and good night.

855
01:38:46,634 --> 01:38:49,228
Hush! My child's asleep!

856
01:38:52,707 --> 01:38:53,901
My husband.

857
01:38:54,542 --> 01:38:57,204
Killed at Verdun.

858
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:01,409
My brothers...

859
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:05,349
Killed at Liège...
Charleroi... Tannenberg.

860
01:39:08,256 --> 01:39:10,190
Our biggest victories.

861
01:39:15,029 --> 01:39:16,929
The table's too big now.

862
01:39:25,906 --> 01:39:27,601
Relax, it's only me!

863
01:39:31,078 --> 01:39:34,172
You don't mind
ifa Frenchman feeds you.

864
01:39:37,285 --> 01:39:41,278
You smell like my grandfather's cows.
A good smell.

865
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:46,055
You're a cow from Würtemberg

866
01:39:46,227 --> 01:39:49,754
and I'm a working man from Paris,
but we can still be pals!

867
01:39:51,799 --> 01:39:54,393
You're a poor cow,
I'm a poor soldier.

868
01:39:54,802 --> 01:39:56,702
We each do our best.

869
01:40:53,327 --> 01:40:55,921
You're a bright little girl.

870
01:40:56,097 --> 01:40:58,258
Mommy and I know everything.

871
01:40:58,432 --> 01:40:59,922
Really?

872
01:41:00,101 --> 01:41:04,094
Then how much milk
does the cow give each month?

873
01:41:04,271 --> 01:41:07,365
Mommy knows that.
I know I have ten fiingers.

874
01:41:28,963 --> 01:41:30,362
She asked for water.

875
01:41:30,631 --> 01:41:32,121
I know.

876
01:41:33,067 --> 01:41:37,561
For 18 months, I never understood
the guards. But her I understand.

877
01:41:53,487 --> 01:41:56,513
- Nice, but it looks cheap.
- I did my best.

878
01:41:56,690 --> 01:41:59,659
I was talking to Santa Claus.

879
01:42:03,697 --> 01:42:05,858
Joseph's got a nice beard!

880
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,568
Here's the Virgin Mary.

881
01:42:09,236 --> 01:42:11,261
Isn't my little donkey cute?

882
01:42:11,939 --> 01:42:13,531
And my ox?

883
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:15,675
And the infant Jesus...

884
01:42:16,677 --> 01:42:18,110
An ancestor of mine.

885
01:42:18,546 --> 01:42:21,174
"Touché!"
as poor Boeldieu would say.

886
01:42:21,348 --> 01:42:24,681
- Think he's dead?
- Let's not talk about it.

887
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:28,611
We're ready. Go get the kid.

888
01:42:31,792 --> 01:42:35,193
Hold on...
The gramophone and the candles.

889
01:42:38,132 --> 01:42:39,531
Lights out!

890
01:42:46,607 --> 01:42:49,735
Lotte! Baby Jesus has come.

891
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:52,401
I knew he would!

892
01:43:04,124 --> 01:43:06,115
Is it for me?

893
01:43:07,394 --> 01:43:09,589
I want little Jesus.

894
01:43:09,763 --> 01:43:11,560
To take to bed?

895
01:43:11,732 --> 01:43:14,223
No, to eat.

896
01:43:15,302 --> 01:43:17,463
He's not for eating.

897
01:43:17,638 --> 01:43:19,936
She wants to eat Baby Jesus!

898
01:43:22,977 --> 01:43:25,639
Strictly forbidden, my sweet!

899
01:43:27,081 --> 01:43:29,072
Then I'll eat Joseph.

900
01:43:29,683 --> 01:43:31,981
All right, but in bed.

901
01:43:34,088 --> 01:43:36,921
She wants Joseph? There you go.

902
01:43:41,195 --> 01:43:44,164
You're a good little girl.

903
01:43:48,602 --> 01:43:50,968
Your gramophone's on the blink.

904
01:43:53,707 --> 01:43:56,039
How do you say:
" Lotte has blue eyes"?

905
01:44:17,731 --> 01:44:19,358
Go to sleep, pumpkin.

906
01:44:41,822 --> 01:44:44,188
I don't know how to thank you.

907
01:44:44,358 --> 01:44:46,019
Thank us?

908
01:44:46,393 --> 01:44:48,486
We owe you so much.

909
01:44:50,564 --> 01:44:52,429
Well... good night.

910
01:46:40,374 --> 01:46:42,103
I'll make some coffee.

911
01:46:42,276 --> 01:46:43,641
The coffee's ready.

912
01:46:44,511 --> 01:46:45,603
Say it in French.

913
01:46:56,890 --> 01:46:58,881
Have you told her we're leaving?

914
01:47:01,395 --> 01:47:02,487
Not yet.

915
01:47:02,663 --> 01:47:03,994
It's high time.

916
01:47:06,767 --> 01:47:08,166
You tell her.

917
01:47:15,909 --> 01:47:18,810
- We must be going.
- I knew it.

918
01:47:18,979 --> 01:47:23,643
Maréchal couldn't bear to tell you.

919
01:47:24,485 --> 01:47:25,747
Why?

920
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,752
I always knew he'd have to go.

921
01:47:37,698 --> 01:47:38,960
Come on in.

922
01:47:40,033 --> 01:47:41,625
There's hot coffee.

923
01:48:02,689 --> 01:48:05,487
You should eat something
before you go.

924
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:15,531
Do we wait until dark?

925
01:48:15,702 --> 01:48:17,067
Sure.

926
01:48:29,082 --> 01:48:32,313
Let's say good-bye to the cow.

927
01:48:35,489 --> 01:48:37,889
I've been alone too long.

928
01:48:39,526 --> 01:48:41,494
I've waited so long.

929
01:48:44,031 --> 01:48:46,693
If you knew how happy I've been

930
01:48:48,602 --> 01:48:52,436
to hear your footsteps
around the house.

931
01:49:00,214 --> 01:49:02,182
Elsa... Listen.

932
01:49:05,786 --> 01:49:07,879
When war over...

933
01:49:08,922 --> 01:49:11,220
if me not dead...

934
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:13,119
Understand?

935
01:49:14,127 --> 01:49:17,961
I... come back here... no?

936
01:49:20,601 --> 01:49:22,592
And you... after... come...

937
01:49:23,070 --> 01:49:25,903
with me... to France.

938
01:49:26,273 --> 01:49:27,740
With Lotte... no?

939
01:49:31,879 --> 01:49:34,245
For the journey.

940
01:49:42,723 --> 01:49:44,987
Go quickly. It's better that way.

941
01:50:26,166 --> 01:50:30,000
- Not looking back?
- If I do, I might never leave.

942
01:51:05,405 --> 01:51:08,203
- Let's move.
- We're not waiting till dark?

943
01:51:08,375 --> 01:51:10,138
We'd lose ourway.

944
01:51:10,477 --> 01:51:14,914
The woods will hide us. But in
the valley, we'll have to stay low.

945
01:51:15,148 --> 01:51:17,309
You're sure that's Switzerland?

946
01:51:17,484 --> 01:51:20,009
- Positive.
- It all looks the same.

947
01:51:20,187 --> 01:51:23,850
You can't see borders.
They're man-made.

948
01:51:24,324 --> 01:51:26,189
Nature couldn't care less.

949
01:51:26,727 --> 01:51:29,025
I want to see an end to all this.

950
01:51:29,529 --> 01:51:31,087
Then I'd go back for Elsa.

951
01:51:31,264 --> 01:51:33,061
- You love her?
- I think so.

952
01:51:33,233 --> 01:51:35,326
Even if we do make it,

953
01:51:35,502 --> 01:51:40,064
you'll go back to flying
and me to gunning, we'll keep fighting.

954
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:43,676
Like the fellas.
We've got to end this damn war...

955
01:51:43,844 --> 01:51:45,539
and make it the last.

956
01:51:45,712 --> 01:51:47,270
Don't delude yourself.

957
01:51:47,447 --> 01:51:51,008
Let's come down to earth.
What if we run into a patrol?

958
01:51:51,184 --> 01:51:54,017
We split up, and try our luck.

959
01:51:54,187 --> 01:51:57,884
just in case, let's say goodbye
and see you soon.

960
01:51:58,692 --> 01:52:02,093
- So long, you dirty Jew.
- So long, you old dog.

961
01:52:42,235 --> 01:52:44,601
Don't shoot!
They're in Switzerland.

962
01:52:44,771 --> 01:52:46,432
Good for them!
