1
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,297
Yeah, you can leave her
in the hallway for now.

2
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:01,263
Stabilizing here.
Where's the portable x-ray?

3
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,010
Check, charge or cash?

4
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,887
Cash. And, uh...

5
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,017
...make it out
to Jack's Demolition, Tucson.

6
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,645
Seven eighty-eight thirty.

7
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,155
Okay.

8
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,421
Hey.

9
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,298
Taking me to breakfast?

10
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,050
I can't, I'm meeting Bosko.

11
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,261
Hey, Vincent.

12
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,513
- Mom, where are my barrettes?
Hi, sweetie.

13
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,100
- I saw them on the kitchen table.
- They're not there. I already checked.

14
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,478
- Want me to make coffee?
- No school today?

15
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,898
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

16
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,275
Try under the cushions on the sofa.

17
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,072
He's already a half an hour late.

18
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,451
He gonna show? Or that son of a bitch
gonna stand her up like last time?

19
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,245
- I'll make coffee.
- I'm out of time, babe.

20
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,928
Mom, where are my barrettes?
They're not in the couch.

21
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,555
Wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,350
I don't wanna wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

23
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,186
Did you check in your bathroom?
- I checked everywhere.

24
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,064
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Find them.

25
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,150
- Mom, pay attention.
- All right, sweetie, all right. What?

26
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,277
- Daddy's gonna be here.
- Okay, he's gonna...

27
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,363
I'm not gonna be ready. I can't be late.

28
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,698
- You won't be late.
- No, I will be late.

29
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,827
Okay. Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

30
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,037
- It's all right, baby. It's all right.
- [SOBBING] No.

31
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,831
It's all right. It's all right.

32
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,917
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them together.

33
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,839
Just relax. He won't come
before we find them. I promise you.

34
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,851
Hey. Give me another refill.

35
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,105
Now he wants a refill.

36
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,116
- What's your name?
WAINGRO: Waingro.

37
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,168
You're Michael, huh?

38
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,224
You guys always work together?

39
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,059
All the time.

40
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,770
- Real tight crew, huh?
- Real tight.

41
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,734
Yeah, if this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

42
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,403
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

43
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,292
- How's he doing?
- A hundred percent.

44
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,377
Right on schedule.

45
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,254
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

46
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,843
- We're a mile and a half from you.
- Okay.

47
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,953
Just crossed over the number-one lane,
300 yards from you now.

48
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,539
- Get set.
- I am.

49
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,831
Put that on.

50
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,799
Here we go.

51
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,362
Two eleven! Two eleven!
We're being held up!

52
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,454
Two-eleven alarm. Armored car.

53
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,539
There's the call. Three minutes.

54
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,792
Clear!

55
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,233
Eighty seconds left!

56
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,278
Get back. Get back.

57
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,863
Get back!

58
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,243
Hey, Slick, you see that shit
coming out of their ears?

59
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,954
They can't fucking hear you. Cool it.

60
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,801
I got it.

61
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,594
Got it.

62
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,349
You had to fuck with me.

63
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,268
You wanna fuck with me?

64
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,169
Come on! What the fuck are you doing?

65
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,920
- What did you do?
WAINGRO: I had to, man.

66
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,256
- Guy was making a move.
Let's go.

67
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,724
Dumb motherfucker.

68
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,756
- Step back, please, sir.
- I heard them.

69
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,365
A million six.

70
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,409
Forty cents on the dollar,
640,000 to you.

71
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,954
Here's a 150 front money.

72
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,414
Get you the rest in two, three days.

73
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,751
Know who owned these?

74
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,257
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

75
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,427
Roger Van Zant.
Owns banks in the Caymans.

76
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,098
Runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

77
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,601
- So?
- So you ripped off his bearer bonds.

78
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,937
He's got insurance.

79
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,940
That's the point.
He collects 100 percent from the insurance.

80
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,944
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds
back from us for 60 percent of their value.

81
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,114
And make 40 percent
on top of the 100 percent.

82
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,911
Sell it back to him instead of going to
the street. That's an extra 320,000 to you.

83
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,788
Try it on him.

84
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,332
- Kelso called.
- About what?

85
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,085
A score he's putting out
and wants you to look at.

86
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,838
What do I need his score for?
I got my own.

87
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,132
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

88
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,302
- Nine a.m. Tomorrow.
- What happened out there?

89
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,680
Don't ask.

90
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,549
Find the ambulance?

91
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,261
- Dumped it four blocks from here.
- 22nd Street between Figueroa and Flower.

92
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,806
They torched it. Burned everything.
The guns, clothes, everything.

93
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,184
REPORTER:
Investigators are still working the scene...

94
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,603
They were airborne.
Taped the last few seconds...

95
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,022
...of the black-and-whites
doing demolition derby.

96
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,068
Stolen out of Fresno two weeks ago.

97
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,862
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
day before yesterday.

98
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:52,992
You taking this one, lieutenant,
or does it stay in Division?

99
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,038
This look like gangbangers
working the local 7-Eleven to you?

100
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,624
- Robbery-Homicide's taking it. Yeah.
All yours.

101
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,294
We got three motorists. All they saw
were men with masks. They were distant.

102
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,382
Console TV man over there however,
he was closer.

103
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,509
He ID anybody?

104
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,720
Well, he was hiding. He heard it mostly.

105
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,557

Okay. What about them?

106
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,395
HEINZ: Right. Now, according to TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

107
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,939
Smart.
- Yeah, somebody called a guard "Slick."

108
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,565
- Slick?
- Yeah.

109
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:30,238
Now, this guy... I figure this guy went
for that holdout piece, ankle holster, right?

110
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,823
From here.

111
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,659
Bang. Bang. Bang, bang, bang.

112
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,411
To his side.

113
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:41,457
This guy here has got what appears to be
a double-tap entry wound to the sternum.

114
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,419
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

115
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,045
Probably executed.

116
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:52,260
And it was a million six in bearer bonds,
and they ignored the loose cash.

117
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,138
Because they had no time,
because they were on a clock.

118
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,099
Which means they knew
our response time to a 211...

119
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,477
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...

120
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,063
...escaped in under three minutes.

121
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,858
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

122
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,612
- Two freeways within a quarter of a mile.
- Traffic video camera?

123
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,781
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

124
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,450
You recognize the M.O.?

125
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,369
M.O. Is that they're good.

126
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,372
Once it escalated into a murder-one beef
for all of them...

127
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,625
...after they killed the first two guards,
they didn't hesitate...

128
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,671
...popped guard number three
because what difference does it make?

129
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,590
Why leave a living witness?

130
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,052
Drop of a hat,
these guys will rock 'r roll.

131
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,473
The shape charge.

132
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,393
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

133
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,479
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

134
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:48,274
So let's start looking for recent
high-line burglaries that have mystified us.

135
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,610
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.

136
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,945
You're gonna get the phone book.
Do it anyway.

137
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,115
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

138
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,827
Check the usual fences.
You and I will check Cusamano and Torena.

139
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,706
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.
Hang in with Forensics.

140
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,667
From the bomb squad,
I want the explosive.

141
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,754
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

142
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,591
Get your hand out of that mars pocket,
Rachel.

143
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,842
Oh, Vince.

144
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,143
Want some pie?

145
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,446
Gotta go to the john.

146
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,897
Look, I had to get it on, man.
He was making a move. I had to get it on.

147
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:27,081
Split's in the car.
I took out of ours evenly...

148
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,084
...to make up for his full end.

149
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,754
Because I wanna pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

150
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:34,922
Okay.

151
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,213
Hold it!

152
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,934
Hey.

153
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,023
Where's the rest?
- We're late.

154
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,235
Ooh, you look too good to go out.
I could just jump you right here.

155
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,907
Where is it?
- Uh, squared the bookies, baby.

156
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,494
There's more in a couple days,
so don't sweat it. We really are late.

157
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,789
Yeah, come on, you gotta be kidding me.

158
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,294
Honey, it ain't won'th the risks you take
for 8000.

159
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,297
Like in risk versus reward, baby.

160
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,799
Let's go. Get your coat.

161
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,221
There is no point talking to you.
All you are is a child growing older.

162
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,723
What's that supposed to mean?

163
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:35,061
It means we're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults, living our lives.

164
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,480
I'm married to a gambling junkie
who won't listen.

165
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,315
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

166
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,402
What am I doing
in this rat-bastard situation?

167
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,906
You're not! What do you want from me?
Leave the bankbook and car keys...

168
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,284
...in the kitchen on your way out.
Are we going, or am I going alone?

169
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,953
You could keep that other crap
but Dominick would go with me.

170
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,665
Don't you even think about...

171
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,776
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena called back.

172
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,155
- Albert Torena call Vincent?
- No.

173
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,658
No. Report came in.

174
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,994
The explosive was Dynex,
linear-shaped charge used in demolition.

175
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:38,165
You can pick it up with a driver's license
in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

176
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,670
- Too common to trace a sale, Vincent.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

177
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,816
Are you all right?

178
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,527
What happened? Where you been?

179
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,862
Work.

180
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,323
Laurers dad show up?

181
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:17,079
Didrt call, didn't show.
We waited for you till 10:30.

182
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:22,418
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with his kid?

183
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,005
I don't know.

184
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,048
Fucking jerk.

185
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,051
Well, is she okay?

186
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,054
She's been in her room all day.

187
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,391
So no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

188
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:42,813
Uh, I made dinner for us,
four hours ago. Um...

189
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:48,027
Every time I try to maintain a
consistent mood between us, you withdraw.

190
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:54,742
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk
off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

191
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,577
I'm sorry...

192
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,915
...if the goddamn chicken...

193
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,709
...got overcooked.

194
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,771
- Seven men in Denmark,
to a key defendant here.

195
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,443
Did you find it?
Not yet.

196
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,820
There it is.

197
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,866
It's over here, somewhere.

198
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,791
Interior design?
It's on the back wall.

199
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,434
Coffee, sir?
- Please.

200
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,567
Will you pass the cream?

201
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,988
- Thanks.
- What did you get?

202
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,074
What?

203
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,493
What are you reading?

204
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,166
Book about metals.

205
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,215
"Stress Fractures in Titanium."

206
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,135
What kind of work you do?

207
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,516
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

208
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,689
I've seen you in the store
from time to time.

209
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,274
What store?

210
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,318
Hennessey + Ingalls. I work there.

211
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,153
Uh...

212
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:59,033
If you don't wanna talk to me, it's okay.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

213
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,921
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

214
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:17,551
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.
My name's Neil.

215
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,183
I'm Eady.

216
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,354
You like working there?

217
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,273
Sure.

218
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,652
I get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

219
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,862
What area's that?

220
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,989
Graphic design.

221
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,951
I do, um, letterheads
and logotypes at night...

222
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,954
...and the store's a day job
till I get enough going.

223
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,165
Who do you do that for?

224
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,586
Uh, a restaurant.

225
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,631
I did their menus, and, um...

226
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,052
...a small, uh, record label.

227
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,807
CDs. I've done two so far.

228
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,560
You go to school for that?

229
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,145
Heh, yeah.

230
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,607
- Yeah, I went to Parsons.
- Where's that?

231
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,817
New York City.

232
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,319
How long you been out here?

233
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,447
About a year.

234
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,950
- You like it?
- Ha, ha.

235
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,162
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

236
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,547
- Live in this neighborhood?
- Ah, no...

237
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,633
...I live, um, kind of above Sunset Plaza.

238
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,303
It's actually kind of...
It's a little house that I rent.

239
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:47,975
And it's just kind of run-down,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

240
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,727
What about you?

241
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,480
- I live up here.
- That's very funny.

242
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,862
So where's your family from originally?

243
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,321
Um...

244
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,074
I'm Scotch-lrish.

245
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:10,706
They, um, emigrated to Appalachia
in the late 1700s.

246
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,333
Where are you from?

247
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,669
The Bay Area.

248
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,464
Are your folks there?

249
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:25,179
Uh, my mother died a long time ago,
and my father, I don't know where he is.

250
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,889
Got a brother somewhere.

251
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,189
You have a tight family. I can tell.

252
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,191
- Yep.
- Right?

253
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,193
You're right.

254
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,910
Yeah...

255
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,662
City of lights.

256
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:59,630
In Fiji, they have these iridescent algae.
They come out once a year in the water.

257
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,591
That's what it looks like out there.

258
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,594
You been there?

259
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,055
No, I'm going there someday.

260
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,516
Oh, yeah?

261
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,357
You travel a lot?

262
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,488
- Yeah.
- Traveling makes you lonely?

263
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,789
L... I'm alone. I am not lonely.

264
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,666
You?

265
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,585
I get lonely.

266
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,753
Albert!

267
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,715
- Shit.
Albert.

268
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,842
Vincent, what you doing coming here, man?

269
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,386
You crazy? This ain't Disneyland.

270
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:57,182
You were supposed to get back to me
last night, Albert. Where the fuck you been?

271
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:01,436
- I couldn't break free, Vincent. You know.
- Let's violate his ass right now.

272
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:05,732
I do for you, you don't do for me,
is that it?

273
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,735
Vincent, man, I swear,
I was out all night, man.

274
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,238
I'm hitting like one of them
flamingo-matador guys.

275
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,532
Flamingo?
That's got nothing to do with me.

276
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,119
I was cutting it real smooth.
I'm generating leads and shit for you.

277
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,663
- I'm a dancer, man. You know.
Bullshit.

278
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,249
I paged your ass all day.
I can't stand paging.

279
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,002
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

280
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,088
Where is your empathy, brother?
It's a substance-abuse problem.

281
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,548
Empathy was yesterday.

282
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,675
Today you're wasting
my motherfucking time.

283
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,011
- Vincent, man, look...
- Did you fall in love?

284
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,597
Come on. Did you fall in love last night
and you went off somewhere?

285
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,100
- Vincent...
- Just tell me that. I'll settle for it.

286
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,936
- I'll buy that.
- Vincent.

287
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,229
Give me all you got!

288
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,398
- Vincent...
- Give me all you got!

289
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,402
I swear, man, my brother, man...
My brother Richard's gonna talk to you.

290
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,279
I heard "Richard"?

291
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,573
- He's gonna talk to you.
- Richard?

292
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,074
Richard.
- Richard.

293
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,286
- He's gonna meet you, I swear, tonight.
- He's not here, is he?

294
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,789
- No, he's gonna meet you tonight.
- Tonight? What happened to now?

295
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,752
L... l... I implored him
because I knew you was coming this a.m.

296
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,046
This is a bunch of bullshit.
- No, no, I swear.

297
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,466
- He said no because he in Phoenix.
- Ahh.

298
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,552
But this, man, I swear... I swear, man...

299
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,936
Tonight's the best I can do for you, man.

300
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:31,234
You know?
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado...

301
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,737
...at 2 a.m. Be there.

302
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,322
You be there too.

303
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,366
Vincent, I can't be there, man.
I got things to do, Vincent.

304
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,995
- I got things to do, places to be. I got...
- Hey, hey, hey.

305
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,331
Be there.

306
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,048
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

307
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,053
What is it?

308
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,847
It's a bank.

309
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,309
It depos cash on Thursday
for distribution to all the other branches...

310
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,520
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

311
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,856
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

312
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,692
- On the prowl or strong?
- Strong. Through the front door.

313
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,694
- How many guys?
- Eh...

314
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,864
Four, or three plus a driver.
Walk in, knock them over, walk out.

315
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,407
And you want a 100,000 advance...

316
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,868
...against a 10-percent cut for that?
- Uh-huh.

317
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:25,330
Sounds like an address to a cowboy score.
They hit the holdup alarms...

318
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,208
...I gotta get out before the cops show.
What is that?

319
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,752
They hit three holdup alarm systems.

320
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,046
Two telco and a cellular.

321
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,843
See, but the signals
aren't going anywhere because...

322
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,849
See, the night before, you cut in
and trick out the alarm-system computer...

323
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:49,604
...to turn itself and the video recorders off
20 minutes before you walk in the door.

324
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,315
Architectural,
electrical-engineering plans?

325
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:56,736
I got all that. Schematics, got the boards
already built. They go straight into the CPU.

326
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,739
What's the estimate?

327
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,704
Twelve-point-one-, 12.2 million.

328
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,708
You're on.

329
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,918
Congratulations.

330
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:16,047
And to give you a little idea of where my
estimates come from, this is a printout...

331
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,633
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

332
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:22,304
Be that as it may, my way you get
100 percent from the insurance company...

333
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,140
...and take the bonds from us
at 60 cents on the dollar...

334
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,392
...and make yourself another 40 percent.

335
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,938
Your operation doesn't skip a beat.
Everybody makes out.

336
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,608
Sure, you got a deal.

337
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:38,486
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets their underwear in a twist.

338
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:42,282
Yeah, so you have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.

339
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,825
Yeah, okay.

340
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,660
Nice talking to you.

341
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,288
You gonna deal with these guys?

342
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,458
So word's out on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

343
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,294
I'm gonna kill the sons of bitches.

344
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,756
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Islands' offshore.

345
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,222
That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

346
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,683
I have a printout of the, uh, cash flow
of the bank for the past two months.

347
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,478
- How'd you get this information?
- Just comes to you.

348
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,480
This stuffjust flies through the air.

349
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,650
They send information out
and it's beamed out all over the place.

350
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:20,153
All you have to do is know how to grab it.
See, I know how to grab it.

351
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:30,121
Um... Okay, here we go.
Thirteen-point-nine million.

352
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,751
- I bought it.
- Good.

353
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,711
What did I tell you?

354
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,591
Here.

355
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:46,012
We're on.
Call Van Zant, collect the money.

356
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:50,100
- How is he?
- He's a businessman.

357
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,061
Okay.

358
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,424
Avocado.
- "Avocado."

359
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,594
- Hello?
NEIL [OVER PHONE]: Yeah, hello.

360
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,055
Chris is at my place.

361
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,854
- What's wrong?
- Husband-and-wife stuff.

362
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,898
I'll let him sleep it off here.

363
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,456
What happened to you?

364
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:02,255
- When you gonna get some furniture?
- When I get around to it.

365
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,968
Charlene's gonna leave me.

366
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,513
Why?

367
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,268
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

368
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,521
With everything we've been doing?

369
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,525
Vegas and the Super Bowl
cleaned me out.

370
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:27,113
- When you gonna get an old lady?
- When I get around to it.

371
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,159
You got something else on the side?

372
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,120
Nothing regular.

373
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,123
She got something else on the side?

374
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,625
- No.
- You sure?

375
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,795
Yeah, I'm sure.

376
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,673
I don't know what you're doing.

377
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,052
Remember Jimmy MacAwain on the yard
used to say:

378
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,137
"You wanna be making moves
on the street?

379
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,307
Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

380
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,893
...that you cannot walk out on
in 30 seconds flat...

381
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,521
...if you spot the heat around the corner."

382
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,231
Remember that?

383
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,990
For me,
the sun rises and sets with her, man.

384
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,410
Yeah?

385
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,121
Yeah.

386
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,958
Okay.

387
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,173
Today we take delivery of cash
from Van Zant...

388
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,385
...then I drop our deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

389
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,845
Bank? What bank?

390
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,014
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

391
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,183
That goes too, then the bank.

392
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,940
- You want some breakfast?
- Yeah.

393
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,865
Are you okay?

394
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,117
Yeah, sugar.

395
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,540
Yeah.

396
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,958
- For real.
- Okay.

397
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,378
Gonna do good. I'll see you later.

398
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,688
You Solenko? I'm Don Breedan.

399
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,984
Grierson, my parole officer, told me to come
by here and see if you had a job for me.

400
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:32,071
- You're familiar with this kind of operation?
- Yeah, man. I'm a great grill man.

401
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,575
Good. Good for you. Here,
you'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher...

402
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,744
...bus tables and empty the garbage too.

403
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,830
Give me a hard time,
I'll report you loaded, drunk or stealing.

404
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,583
And I will violate you back so fast
your head will spin.

405
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,252
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

406
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,923
Rules of the game.
Call Grierson, check it out.

407
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,008
Change in the back.

408
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,432
Well, what are you waiting for?

409
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,203
Malibu Equity and Investments.

410
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,373
- Yeah, Roger Van Zant.
- Please hold.

411
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,337
Yeah, this is Roger Van Zant.

412
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,964
I'm supposed to collect something.

413
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,468
Give me your number, and somebody
will call you right back from a different line.

414
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:39,639
818-133-6089.

415
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,247
Yep.

416
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,165
I got a package for you.

417
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,376
There's a drive-in on Centinela.
Two-thirty tomorrow.

418
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,087
Okay, just send one man, alone.

419
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,947
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

420
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,700
Who the...? Who...? Who was that guy?

421
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,369
- He's nobody.
- I gotta know who he is. Who is he?

422
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,038
- He's nobody, Neil.
- Listen, you...

423
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,707
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas.

424
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,543
- Alan Marciano.
- Chris is gonna straighten it up with you.

425
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,504
- It's too late. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it!
- Shut up!

426
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,009
Here's the deal.
You'll give Chris one last shot.

427
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:02,388
After that, he fucks up,
then I will finance setting you up myself...

428
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,641
...on my own, anywhere you want.

429
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,810
Dominick will go with you.
And my word counts.

430
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:12,148
But right now,
you will give him the chance.

431
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:20,823
Clean up. Go home.

432
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,453
Give me all your money.

433
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,914
One day you gonna get smoked
with that shit.

434
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,249
Ain't gonna be you, fool.

435
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:18,339
- He's coming in alone. Send him through.
- Yeah, got it.

436
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,370
Vincent, hey, man.

437
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:54,333
Vincent. This is my brother, Richard.
Richard, Vincent.

438
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,919
- Richard.
- Yo, it's all right.

439
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,297
What have you got for me?

440
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,340
Before we even get into that...

441
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:05,678
...there's this crew ripping rides
all along the beach areas, all right?

442
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,222
Now, the back of a trim shop on Irvine...

443
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,476
...if somebody was to pay a little visit
this weekend...

444
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:15,521
...they might find two Turbos
and a 911 Slope.

445
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,357
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition.

446
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,277
- Hmm?
- Eh, I'm a good citizen.

447
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:25,198
I'm Donald Duck.
So you got something to tell me or what?

448
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,243
Check this out, coz.

449
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:33,039
How do I know
if I tell you what you need to know...

450
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,708
...you're gonna do
what the fuck I need to get done?

451
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:39,629
Richard, man, Hanna is straight up, man.
We do business all the time.

452
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,089
I ain't your coz, you rat motherfucker.

453
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:47,887
And you know because I say so
after I hear what the fuck you gotta tell me.

454
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,473
Look here, man.
You understand what I'm saying?

455
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,642
I can get killed for telling you this shit.

456
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,936
Or you're gonna get killed
walking your doggie.

457
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,938
All right.

458
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,398
There's this cat I was locked up with
in Folsom.

459
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:03,820
Did a couple, two, three years.
He got out and I ran into him.

460
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,282
And so?

461
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,868
He's a big fiend for action.

462
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:14,539
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing...

463
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:18,417
...but he goes on and on, running down
to me how he ain't been doing nothing...

464
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,254
...and nothing's been going on,
and all this bullshit.

465
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:27,426
So right then and there I know
this cat's got something going down.

466
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,893
Pretty fucking great.

467
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,939
Albert, what's wrong with you?

468
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:43,818
You drag me here,
waste my time like this.

469
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:47,154
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

470
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:52,076
- That's right.
- Well, I am over-fucking-whelmed.

471
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,620
What do you want for that,
a Junior G-man badge?

472
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,123
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches or what?

473
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,458
Is he kidding me?

474
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,088
- Vincent...
- I'm telling you, this Slick is no joke.

475
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,756
You know what I'm saying?

476
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,675
- Say what? Say what?
- What?

477
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:12,763
- You said, "Slick." What does that mean?
- Slick. That's what he calls people, "Slick."

478
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,225
And tell me about him.

479
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:21,856
About 6 feet tall, lot ofjailhouse tats.

480
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,317
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

481
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,613
What's his name?

482
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,990
Cheritto.

483
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,160
Michael Cheritto.

484
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,665
Thirty-three busts since 1976.

485
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,335
Eleven for armed robbery,
three convictions.

486
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:46,297
Two out of a three-to-five-year beef
in Attica. Three years in Marion.

487
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,926
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

488
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,928
- Jacket's 2 inches thick.
- Okay.

489
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,014
- Who do I have there now?
- Drucker and me, boss. And Schwartz.

490
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,016
Tell SIS I want full surveillance.

491
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,019
That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

492
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:04,273
We never close. Open seven days a week.
Bug the car, the house, the work.

493
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,525
When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant...

494
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,986
...I want pictures
of who he moves and sits with.

495
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:13,032
Then run makes on them. They got jackets,
I wanna see who they move and sit with.

496
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,701
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

497
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,259
- Put your hands where I can see them.
- What?

498
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,429
- Put your hands where I can see them.
- All right.

499
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:20,224
I tell you what to do,
I tell you how to do it.

500
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,937
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

501
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,607
...take the package and throw it in here.

502
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,127
Fuck. Behind you. On the right.

503
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,792
Yeah, Roger Van Zant?

504
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,920
- Yeah, who's this?
- You know who this is.

505
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,464
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

506
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:20,219
I sent a guy to deliver the package.
He didn't call. Is everything right?

507
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,514
Tell you what, forget the money.

508
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:27,560
- What?
- Forget the money.

509
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,436
Wh...

510
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:33,691
It's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Forget the money"?

511
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,735
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone...

512
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,571
I don't understand.

513
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,408
- Because there is a dead man
on the other end of this fucking line.

514
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,929
Oh, my.

515
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,432
Do you like it?
- Look at my ring.

516
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,018
- Wow.
- Ha-ha-ha.

517
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,940
Did you know about this?
It's so beautiful.

518
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,775
You are insane.

519
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:22,907
Do you like it?

520
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,950
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

521
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:28,454
- Just don't ask him where he got it.
Yeah, that's right. Ha-ha-ha.

522
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,172
What do you wanna be
when you grow up, honey?

523
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,549
I don't know.

524
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,721
She doesn't know.
Just like me. I don't know either.

525
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,654
Hello?

526
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,739
Hi, it's me.

527
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,660
Hey. I was wondering if you'd call.

528
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,747
I've been busy. Can I see you?

529
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:16,919
I was afraid that was just the one night,
you know?

530
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,005
No, not for me, it wasrt.

531
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,093
Yeah, me neither.

532
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,513
Can I fall by?

533
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,850
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

534
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,029
Thank you.

535
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,532
- Good night.
- Ha-ha-ha.

536
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,076
Goddamn convention.

537
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,329
- Which one's Slick?
- The wide one.

538
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,706
Got two transmitters.

539
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,917
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.

540
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,544
Okay, get ready.

541
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,921
- Did you say good night to Neil?
- Good night.

542
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:04,717
One with the blond hair is Chris Shiherlis.
SIS has got a revolving tail...

543
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,677
...and hung a wire on the house phone.

544
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:12,224
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

545
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,269
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

546
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,397
Sammy and I think that's gonna
be their next score.

547
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,566
Who's the loner?

548
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:26,572
First time we're seeing him.
We're not on him yet.

549
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,242
Well, get on it.

550
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,502
Okay.

551
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:53,724
When these guys walk out the door
of whatever score they're gonna take next...

552
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,770
...they're gonna have the surprise
of a lifetime.

553
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,537
Hey, baby. Time to go.

554
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,707
WAINGRO:
I showed you a good time, didn't I?

555
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,918
Oh, yeah.

556
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,381
You fly. You cool.

557
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:36,725
You're lying to me.
I can always tell when people lie to me.

558
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:40,896
Mm, I ain't lying. You a hot dog.

559
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,649
A regular rodeo rider.

560
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:47,194
And this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

561
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,909
Now I got to get my ass
street side, sugar.

562
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,370
You don't have a truth-telling style.

563
00:56:56,538 --> 00:57:01,083
- What are you talking about?
- You don't know what this is.

564
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:10,050
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

565
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,154
Where you been?

566
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,365
SHU at Pelican Bay.

567
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,909
New Folsom, B-wing.

568
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:40,289
I am a cowboy
looking for anything heavy.

569
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,167
Billy Ricketts said come see you.

570
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,711
That is why I am here.

571
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,969
Why don't you...?

572
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:57,681
Why don't you call this guy?

573
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,517
This guy's always putting guys on.

574
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,397
Thank you, brother.

575
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,151
I'll buy you a drink?
Buy me a drink.

576
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,408
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

577
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,786
- It's really dumb.
- Something smells negligent.

578
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:22,873
You two are perfect for each other.
How did you meet?

579
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,713
- I knew this guy in, uh, grade school.
- Uh-oh.

580
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,049
He was named Raoul, uh... Whatever.

581
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:35,886
Anyway, the guy could take his fingers
and fold them over, one over the other.

582
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,013
Then he'd turn his eyelids inside out...

583
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:42,184
I can't keep my hands off you,
and that's the truth.

584
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:47,689
That's what's so wonderful about you,
in that bestial sort of way.

585
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,403
Woman.

586
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,787
This better be earth-shattering.

587
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,836
That's what she tells us. To Raoul.

588
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,047
- Raoul.
- To Raoul.

589
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,383
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

590
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,552
Here's how we found her.

591
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,850
- How old?
- Sixteen, seventeen.

592
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,060
Been here about six hours.

593
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,687
How'd she die, Rachel?

594
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,274
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

595
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,236
Who's that?

596
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,489
- Mother and siblings, I guess.
- What the hell they doing here?

597
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:23,368
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside
knew the girl and called the family.

598
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,704
Okay, let's go.

599
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,585
That's nice.

600
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:35,881
When I run a DNA check on the semen, my
intuition says it's coming up the same guy.

601
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:39,259
So it's a series,
and ending up in your court.

602
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,554
- Sheriff"s Homicide getting anywhere?
- Not yet.

603
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,557
- Get her.
- Get off me. Get off me.

604
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,225
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

605
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,895
- Oh, my God.
- Hold it, hold it.

606
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:57,444
- Where is she?
- Easy, easy, easy.

607
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,907
Please. Please, come on.

608
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,621
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Who did this?

609
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,832
Where's my baby? Where is she?

610
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,378
I need to know what happened.

611
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,380
I guess the Earth shattered.

612
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:02,384
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

613
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:07,347
I didn't wanna ruin their night too.
What was it?

614
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,809
You don't wanna know.

615
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,311
I'd like to know
what's behind that grim look.

616
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:16,940
I don't do that. You know it.
Let's go. Come on.

617
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:20,819
You never told me I'd be excluded.

618
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:26,283
I told you when we hooked up, baby,
that you were gonna have to share me...

619
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:30,203
...with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

620
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:34,791
And I bought into that sharing
because I love you.

621
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:40,881
I love you fat, bald, money, no money,
driving a bus. I don't care.

622
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:44,259
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy some of the time.

623
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,970
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

624
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:50,140
Oh, I see. What I should do
is, uh, come home and say:

625
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:54,186
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today...

626
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:58,106
...where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave...

627
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,902
...because it was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

628
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:04,905
Come on, let's share that,
and in sharing it...

629
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:11,077
...we'll somehow, uh, cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit." Right?

630
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:16,082
Wrong. You know why?

631
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,418
Because you prefer the normal routine:

632
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,796
We fuck,
then you lose the power of speech.

633
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,507
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

634
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:28,720
I preserve it, because I need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

635
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,056
Where I gotta be.

636
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,898
You don't live with me.

637
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,320
You live among the remains
of dead people.

638
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,950
You read the terrain.

639
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,454
You search for signs of passing...

640
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,665
...for the scent of your prey...

641
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,625
...and then you hunt them down.

642
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,839
That's the only thing
you're committed to.

643
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,928
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

644
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:18,520
What I don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

645
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,288

Hey. Miss Lillian.

646
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,041
Let's go, baby.

647
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:46,339
I met the manager. Is that the boss?

648
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:49,676
I did time for what that motherfucker does
every day.

649
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:54,264
Baby, can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

650
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,600
Can you do that?

651
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,646
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

652
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,946
What you hanging with me for, Lillian?

653
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,450
Because I'm proud of you.

654
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,875
- You're proud of me?
- Mm-hm.

655
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:28,089
What the hell you proud of me for?

656
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,051
Come on home.

657
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,814
What were you doing there?
- I was skiing.

658
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:47,192
I was trying to ski.

659
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:51,154
That's what people do there.
You go skiing and you, um...

660
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,239
...you meet people.

661
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,908
You try to have a good time.

662
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,743
- Did you have a good time?
- No.

663
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,036
Why not?

664
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,538
I'm not good at meeting people.

665
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,624
You met me.

666
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,710
Well, that happened
without my thinking about it.

667
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,380
Which is why, probably.

668
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:11,091
No, it's because you were fine.

669
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,678
Eady.

670
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:18,390
Take off with me for a while.

671
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,393
- Where?
- New Zealand.

672
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,063
When?

673
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,608
I have to go separate,
but you could meet me there.

674
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,777
But my job, my...

675
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:35,782
I got money. You don't need money.
You could set up a studio, do work there.

676
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,785
- I don't know.
- What's there to know?

677
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,912
Are you married?

678
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,581
- What?
- You come and go...

679
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,375
The last thing I am is married.

680
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:48,586
I'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way, a double blank.

681
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,588
Then, all of a sudden...

682
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,800
...someone like you comes along.

683
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,973
- You don't know me, Neil.
- I know enough.

684
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:05,520
Come with me.

685
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:16,948
What's wrong, baby?

686
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:21,411
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right.
Will you go?

687
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,500
Yeah.

688
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,380
Good.

689
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,948
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

690
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:02,327
What happened?
You forget your mom was picking you up?

691
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,288
No.

692
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,666
So, what's going on?

693
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,378
I felt like being alone.

694
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:17,008
Okay. Come on, I'll drive you home.

695
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:25,517
- Hey, Mike.
MIKE: Hey, Lauren.

696
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:14,732
What's happening?

697
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,735
Lieutenant. Sir.

698
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:20,530
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

699
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:23,700
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

700
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,589
Technique.

701
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:41,027
Open sesame. Right there.

702
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,295
There he goes.

703
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:44,108
- We walk.
- I'm right there.

704
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:46,277
We walk! Now! Come on.

705
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:02,126
He's heard it.

706
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,220
Heads up.

707
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,014
- One's coming out.
- Hold it, captain.

708
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:18,810
- Vincent, he's not carrying anything.
- Yeah, I see.

709
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,190
- Here we go.
- Not till my boss says so.

710
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,859
Vincent, both of them
are not carrying anything.

711
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:38,579
- Okay, let them go.
JACKSON [OVER RADIO]: What?

712
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,165
What are you gonna take them on?
Breaking and entry?

713
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,418
They didn't steal anything.
Don't you get it?

714
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,837
It gets knocked back
to some misdemeanor...

715
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:48,506
...they do six months and they're out.
No fucking way.

716
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,801
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They're not walking.

717
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:55,638
That's exactly what they're gonna do.
They're gonna walk. This is my operation.

718
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:58,182
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

719
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:02,478
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck.

720
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:49,734
Back to work.

721
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:54,739
L.A.P.D. Gee, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

722
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,574
Maybe it's the score they were onto.

723
01:14:56,742 --> 01:15:00,203
The place, not us. Because
it's been hit a couple of times, you know.

724
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:03,039
Assume they got our phones,
assume they got our houses...

725
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,708
...assume they got us right here,
right now as we sit.

726
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,835
Everything. Assume it all.

727
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,087
How we gonna buy the bank package
from Kelso?

728
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:13,424
- I'll front that. That's not a problem.
- What happens to Van Zant?

729
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:17,595
With the heat we got, do you wanna play
World War II in the streets with Van Zant?

730
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,680
No, I want my 750. And he gets a pass?

731
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:24,185
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

732
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,771
Our problem is,
take the bank or split right now?

733
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:29,440
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

734
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,777
Thirty seconds flat from now,
we are gone on our separate ways.

735
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,195
That's it.

736
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,947
Chris.

737
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:41,285
The bank is won'th the risk.

738
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:43,454
I need it, brother.

739
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,292
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

740
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:01,889
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever. Whatever.

741
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,518
No, not on this one, Michael.
On this one, you're on your own.

742
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,491
You figure this is the best thing to do?

743
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,493
This is the best thing to do?

744
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:26,914
I got plans. I'm going away after. So for me
the reward is maybe won'th the stretch.

745
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:30,001
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

746
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,669
You got T-bonds, real estate.

747
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:35,214
If I were you, I would be smart.
I would cut loose of this.

748
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:57,361
Well, you know, for me,
the action is the juice.

749
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,571
I'm in.

750
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:05,411
- You too?
- Yeah, sure.

751
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,830
Ha-ha-ha.
- Let's go.

752
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,874
Fuck them, let's do it.

753
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,627
All right, let's go.
We got a lot of work to do.

754
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:27,975
You can't go in there.
Watch this.

755
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,311
Excuse me...
Tim, I gotta call you back.

756
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,979
You have to have an appointment.

757
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,939
Can I help you?
- Are you Alan Marciano?

758
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:35,983
Yeah, and who the fuck are you?
- Who am I?

759
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:39,820
- Ow! Hey. Hey.
- Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, L.A.P.D.

760
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:43,240
L.A.? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

761
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:46,911
Hey. Hey, I don't know who the fuck
you guys think you're pushing around...

762
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:52,416
...but I know people here, okay?
- Las Vegas P.D. Takes you into custody.

763
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:56,045
You are extradited to Newark
on a New Jersey warrant...

764
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:59,465
...for smuggling cigarettes
up from North Carolina three years ago...

765
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,801
...or you go to work for us.

766
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:03,761
Cut and dried.

767
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,764
- That is it.
- Oh, shit.

768
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:09,684
Charlene Shiherlis.

769
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:11,602
- Who?
- Who?

770
01:18:12,145 --> 01:18:13,938
Who? What are you, a fucking owl?

771
01:18:14,314 --> 01:18:17,942
SCHWARTZ: The lady you been talking dirty
to on the telephone every day last week.

772
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,361
Yeah, you know what?
You can't tie me to her.

773
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:24,448
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jack off.

774
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:28,494
Oh, man, I just...
Why did I get mixed up with that bitch?

775
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:31,372
Because she got a great ass!

776
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:36,043
And you got your head all the way up it.

777
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:37,628
Jesus.

778
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,801
When I think of asses, a womars ass...

779
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,303
...something comes out of me.

780
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:49,807
- So?
So no big thing.

781
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:55,020
All I want is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

782
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:57,481
Now, you're gonna work
with Sergeant Drucker here.

783
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:04,739
- San Clemente Road and Hermosa.
- Uh-huh.

784
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:07,575
That's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

785
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:08,868
Right.

786
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:11,871
The security systems around here
are a joke.

787
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:19,170
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's Escape Route Number 1.

788
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:23,340
Number 2, over here,
Anaheim to the 110.

789
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:24,842
- Good.
- Okay?

790
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,720
- Yeah. That's fine.
- Got it? Good. Let's go.

791
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,703

They were looking back...

792
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:55,206
...in this direction.

793
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,374
A container facility?

794
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:02,087
- For a can'tage theft?
- Too visible. Too lowball for them.

795
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:08,219
Next door's an oil refinery,
over there's a scrap yard.

796
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:11,055
Refinery only pays by check.
No cash around.

797
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:12,890
Same for the scrap yard.

798
01:20:16,394 --> 01:20:18,604
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

799
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:25,069
A refinery and a scrap yard.

800
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:29,073
- What the hell is going on?
- That's what we're trying to figure out.

801
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,076
We thought we had it.

802
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:33,911
Thought we had it.

803
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:48,133
I got an idea
of what they were looking at.

804
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,348
- You wanna know what they're looking at?
- What?

805
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:59,144
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

806
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:03,190
This crew is good.

807
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,527
You know what they were looking at?

808
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:08,112
What?

809
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,031
Us.

810
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,951
The L.A.P.D.

811
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,495
The police department.

812
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:19,290
We just got made.

813
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:28,507
Yeah.

814
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,475
Okay.

815
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:48,694
Okay, motherfucker!

816
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,008
Kelso come through?

817
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:14,345
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

818
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:23,187
Name is Hanna. First name Vincent.

819
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:27,733
I smeared this sergeant in Vice five yards.
Hanna's all over you.

820
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:30,861
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house, Shiherlis'.

821
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:33,364
Not yours,
they've been losing you at night.

822
01:22:33,531 --> 01:22:37,618
Hanna's a hot dog. Graduate school.
Marine Corps.

823
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,912
Lieutenant, Robbery-Homicide,
Major Crime Unit.

824
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,374
He's taken down some heavy crews.
Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago.

825
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:45,793
And he was a fucking maniac.

826
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:50,214
He was working Narcotics before that.
Had some problems, divorced twice.

827
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:53,384
Current wife's Justine.
He's why the extra heat.

828
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,554
The Vice sergeant...

829
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:00,891
...says Hanna likes you.

830
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:04,979
Thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

831
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:07,898
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

832
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,069
Funny as a heart attack, man.
Three marriages.

833
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,531
What the fuck do you think that means?
He likes staying home?

834
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:18,409
Means the man is one of those guys
out there...

835
01:23:18,576 --> 01:23:21,495
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

836
01:23:23,748 --> 01:23:26,000
With this guy and this much heat,
you should pass.

837
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:34,758
It's won'th the stretch.

838
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:40,597
This guy can hit and miss.
You can't miss once.

839
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:42,766
You sure?

840
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,102
I'm sure.

841
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:51,775
Let's go to the garage.

842
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,833
Justine.

843
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,590
Justine?

844
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:22,264
Where we going?

845
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:30,355
- Okay, where are you going?
- Out.

846
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:31,708
- What are you on?
MAN [OVER RADIO]: TAC 9.

847
01:25:33,169 --> 01:25:37,131
[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY
OVER RADIO]

848
01:25:55,733 --> 01:25:58,443
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have I got?

849
01:25:58,778 --> 01:26:02,364
Hey, Vincent, it's JJ.
I'm in Air 40. Richard Glover's with me.

850
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:06,702
It's on the 105 eastbound
approaching the 110 interchange.

851
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,163
You running a revolving tail?

852
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,748
Yeah, I got two units in front, three behind.

853
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:15,961
Okay, have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

854
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,546
Let's go.

855
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:11,516
Am I 100, uh, yards, or what?
Am I close or far, or what?

856
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:14,269
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
Three hundred yards, center lane.

857
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:22,713
How you doing?

858
01:28:25,883 --> 01:28:28,927
What do you say
I buy you a cup of coffee?

859
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:38,353
- Yeah, sure. Let's go.
- Follow me.

860
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,580
Seven years in Folsom.

861
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,582
In the hole for three.

862
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,042
McNeil before that.

863
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:05,964
McNeil as tough as they say?

864
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,717
You looking to become a penologist?

865
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:13,096
You're looking to go back?
You know, I chase down some crews...

866
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:17,684
...guys just looking to fuck up,
get busted back. That you?

867
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:20,604
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

868
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:23,607
I worked all kinds.

869
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:29,154
You see me doing thrill-seeking
liquor-store holdups...

870
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:31,656
...with a "Born to Lose" tattoo
on my chest?

871
01:29:31,824 --> 01:29:34,659
- No, I do not.
- Right.

872
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:37,662
I am never going back.

873
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:41,541
Then don't take down scores.

874
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,337
I do what I do best, I take scores.

875
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:49,132
You do what you do best,
trying to stop guys like me.

876
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:55,180
So you never wanted a regular-type life?

877
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:58,350
What the fuck is that?
Barbecues and ball games?

878
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,228
Yeah.

879
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:08,902
- This regular-type life like your life?
- My life? No, my life...

880
01:30:09,862 --> 01:30:11,822
No, my life's a disaster zone.

881
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:16,410
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

882
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:19,663
...because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

883
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:23,708
I got a wife. We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage...

884
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:25,752
...my third...

885
01:30:27,171 --> 01:30:30,841
...because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

886
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:33,051
That's my life.

887
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:41,101
A guy told me one time:

888
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,646
"Don't let yourself get attached
to anything...

889
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:47,524
...you are not willing to walk out on
in 30 seconds flat...

890
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,860
...if you feel the heat around the corner."

891
01:30:50,903 --> 01:30:54,322
Now, if you're on me,
and you gotta move when I move...

892
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:57,659
...how do you expect to keep a...
A marriage?

893
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,705
Well, that's an interesting point.

894
01:31:02,915 --> 01:31:05,083
What are you, a monk?

895
01:31:05,334 --> 01:31:07,043
I have a woman.

896
01:31:07,211 --> 01:31:09,212
What do you tell her?

897
01:31:11,048 --> 01:31:13,175
I tell her I'm a salesman.

898
01:31:19,515 --> 01:31:23,059
So then, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

899
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:26,229
...you're just gonna walk out
on this woman?

900
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:29,191
Not say goodbye?

901
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:31,693
That's the discipline.

902
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:33,820
That's pretty vacant, no?

903
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:35,655
Yeah, it is what it is.

904
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:38,450
It's that, or we both better
go do something else, pal.

905
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:42,370
I don't know how to do anything else.

906
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:44,831
Neither do I.

907
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:50,754
- I don't much want to either.
- Neither do I.

908
01:31:58,429 --> 01:32:02,015
You know, I have this,
uh, recurring dream.

909
01:32:02,975 --> 01:32:05,644
I'm sitting at this big banquet table...

910
01:32:05,811 --> 01:32:09,689
...and all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are sitting at this table...

911
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:14,110
...and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

912
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:19,282
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

913
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:23,119
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

914
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:26,373
...because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

915
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:30,043
The neighbors reported the smell...

916
01:32:30,586 --> 01:32:34,589
...and there they are,
all of them just sitting there.

917
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:37,342
What do they say?

918
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:40,804
Nothing.

919
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:42,639
- No talk?
- None.

920
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:46,434
Just...
They don't have anything to say.

921
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:49,479
See, we just look at each other.

922
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:54,776
They look at me.
And that's it, that's the dream.

923
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:59,531
I have one where I'm drowning.

924
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:03,368
And I gotta wake myself up
and start breathing, or I'll die in my sleep.

925
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:06,955
You know what that's about?

926
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:10,166
Yeah. Having enough time.

927
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:16,923
- Enough time to do what you wanna do?
- That's right.

928
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:22,512
- You doing it now?
- No, not yet.

929
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:29,686
You know, we're sitting here...

930
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,647
...you and I,
like a couple of regular fellows.

931
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:35,734
You do what you do,
and I do what I gotta do.

932
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:41,031
And now that we've been face to face...

933
01:33:43,326 --> 01:33:48,330
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away,
I won't like it.

934
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:49,831
But I'll tell you...

935
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:55,879
...if it's between you
and some poor bastard...

936
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,548
...whose wife you're gonna
turn into a widow...

937
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:03,720
...brother, you are going down.

938
01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:18,276
There's a flip side to that coin.

939
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:24,407
What if you do got me boxed in
and I gotta put you down?

940
01:34:25,701 --> 01:34:30,413
Because no matter what,
you will not get in my way.

941
01:34:31,123 --> 01:34:34,042
We've been face to face, yeah...

942
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:40,757
...but I will not hesitate.
Not for a second.

943
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:48,932
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

944
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:53,895
Or who knows?

945
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,856
Or maybe
we'll never see each other again.

946
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:13,915
They dumped us.

947
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:16,543
What?

948
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:20,004
- They dumped us.
- What do you mean, they dumped us?

949
01:35:20,172 --> 01:35:21,256
Chris slipped his tail.

950
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:23,883
He doesn't talk about scores
with Charlene...

951
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:26,761
...so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. I tried.

952
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:29,180
- What about Cheritto?
Same.

953
01:35:29,348 --> 01:35:32,100
Transponders got put on a bus
to San Clemente.

954
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:38,982
- They dumped all our surveillance?
- Yeah, at the same time. Nine p.m.

955
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:43,319
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

956
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:45,822
We were on you.
Then McCauley drives into LAX...

957
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,992
...where surveillance can't fly over
because of flight paths.

958
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,495
His car's still there. He's gone.

959
01:35:56,917 --> 01:36:02,881
Does anybody have any idea
where the fuck these people are?

960
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:03,233
You hear from him yet?

961
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:07,862
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

962
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:14,661
This guy here. We put him on.
Says he knows McCauley.

963
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:20,875
Who are you?

964
01:37:22,127 --> 01:37:25,922
Waingro. My name's Waingro.

965
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:29,676
I've been living in this office day and night.
How well do you know him?

966
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:33,930
Oh, we took some major scores together.

967
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:38,935
How come I haven't heard from him?

968
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:42,939
Well, he's probably busy right now,
but he's real thorough.

969
01:37:44,358 --> 01:37:48,236
- He ain't gonna forget about you.
- Oh, that's reassuring.

970
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:53,157
Well, I got some moves
I could make here.

971
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:56,619
Probably be a big help to you.

972
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:18,975
You recognize the grill man?

973
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:31,446
- No.
- Folsom. D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

974
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:36,659
- Ain't got my break yet, man.
- Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

975
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:39,829
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

976
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:41,956
Take your break later.

977
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:45,460
Piece of shit. Pick up.

978
01:38:48,213 --> 01:38:49,964
Where the hell is he?

979
01:38:50,132 --> 01:38:53,468
- I wanted to check the slot for a work car.
- So did I.

980
01:38:58,641 --> 01:39:00,058
Yeah?

981
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:02,769
Hang on.

982
01:39:03,145 --> 01:39:05,063
- Yeah.
- Hey.

983
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:09,776
Use a landline. Call me at 103-7206.

984
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,194
All right.

985
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:24,207
- Where are you?
- There's cops all over me, man.

986
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:28,378
They're on me like a cheap suit.
I can't dump them.

987
01:39:30,881 --> 01:39:34,842
- After the fact you spotted them?
- No, no. They're doing parallels.

988
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,138
I can try to dump them again.

989
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:43,685
How are we gonna know if you did?
If you didn't, you'll draw them to us.

990
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:45,979
Head for Ventura. Pull them out of here.

991
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:50,233
All right. Hey, I'm sorry, man.
Last thing I wanna do is let you down.

992
01:40:13,048 --> 01:40:14,841
Come on, man.

993
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:18,052
Pick up.

994
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:21,848
- Hey, hey, Neil, man. What up?
- What's up, brother?

995
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:24,392
Man, what you doing here?

996
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,312
What I am doing is I'm looking for a driver
who can handle scanners and a radio.

997
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:31,107
Right now, today. You remember the drill?

998
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:34,152
- Yeah, man, sure.
- You cool?

999
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,779
Oh, man, now, you know I'm cool.

1000
01:40:36,947 --> 01:40:40,283
One answer, yes or no. Right now.

1001
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:56,507
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1002
01:40:57,843 --> 01:40:59,969
Out back in five.

1003
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:11,606
- What's burning? What's burning?
CHEF: Nothing I'm doing.

1004
01:41:11,774 --> 01:41:13,483
What is this?

1005
01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:15,818
Where do you think you're going?

1006

Think of your families. Don't risk your life.
Don't try and be a hero.

1026
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:42,798
Right now I want you to sit on the floor
and put your hands on your head.

Tragedy in a Southland neighborhood today.
A bank robbery spilled out into the street.

Claudia Newman, live on the scene.
She has the latest. Claudia?

1073
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:08,257
This afternoon, this neighborhood was
terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.

1074
01:54:08,424 --> 01:54:12,261
With the streets full of mid-day shoppers
and kids, police and armed robbers...

1075
01:54:12,428 --> 01:54:15,097
- Excuse me, bartender?
One minute, lady.

1076
01:54:15,265 --> 01:54:17,808
- Robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.

1077
01:54:17,976 --> 01:54:21,103
A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken
by a bank robbery...

1078
01:54:21,271 --> 01:54:23,856
...that ended in homicide and terror.

1079
01:54:24,023 --> 01:54:27,818
One suspect, Michael Cheritto, is one
of four men involved in the foiled robbery.

1080
01:54:27,986 --> 01:54:30,279
- He died at the scene.
What can I get you, miss?

1081
01:54:30,446 --> 01:54:32,781
Also fatally wounded,
suspect Donald Breedan...

1082
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:34,449
Miss?

1083
01:54:34,617 --> 01:54:38,453
- During the extensive gunfire
between police and suspects.

1084
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:41,999
- Ugh. Un!
- All right, hold him. Hold him.

1085
01:54:42,166 --> 01:54:43,667
- All right. All right.
- It's all right.

1086
01:54:51,843 --> 01:54:54,469
So?
BOB: Well, he's got blood loss and shock.

1087
01:54:54,637 --> 01:54:59,182
I'm gonna give you quarter-grain morphine
for the pain. Subcutaneous injection.

1088
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:01,059
Bottom line.

1089
01:55:01,227 --> 01:55:05,314
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good,
but his, uh, clavicle's fractured.

1090
01:55:05,481 --> 01:55:08,400
- Can he rest for a while?
- Six, seven hours.

1091
01:55:08,568 --> 01:55:10,360
- That's it?
- That's it.

1092
01:55:10,528 --> 01:55:12,779
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

1093
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:16,658
Take off your shirt.

1094
01:55:22,999 --> 01:55:26,084
My... Look, my daughter gave it to me
for Father's Day.

1095
01:55:26,252 --> 01:55:29,171
I don't give a shit who gave it to you.
Take it off.

1096
01:55:34,636 --> 01:55:37,012
Chris. Hey.

1097
01:55:39,098 --> 01:55:41,808
- Chris, listen to me.
- Mm.

1098
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:46,188
Nate's gonna pick you up.
He's gonna take you to his place.

1099
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:50,192
- Where's Charlene?
- We gotta get out of here.

1100
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:52,152
We're all over the 6:00 news.

1101
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:55,656
- We gotta get out of here.
- I'm not going without her.

1102
01:55:55,823 --> 01:55:59,201
Think about that.
I will meet you at Nate's.

1103
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:00,494
Where are you going?

1104
01:56:00,662 --> 01:56:04,957
I gotta find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

1105
01:56:05,208 --> 01:56:06,875
Who did it?

1106
01:56:07,710 --> 01:56:09,252
Who wasrt there?

1107
01:56:10,254 --> 01:56:12,089
Trejo.

1108
01:56:15,551 --> 01:56:16,718
I'll see you at Nate's.

1109
01:56:23,518 --> 01:56:24,559
Yeah.

You come down here right now

01:56:31,526 --> 01:56:35,404
Okay, baby, okay.

1113
01:56:35,571 --> 01:56:37,823
- Okay?
- All right.

1114
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:42,953
Goddamn you, Chris. Goddamn you.

1115
01:56:43,454 --> 01:56:47,374
- You're on a plane for Los Angeles.
- Great.

1116
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:37,340
Why'd you do it? What happened?

1117
01:57:38,843 --> 01:57:40,552
- They made me.
- Who?

1118
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,471
Where's Anna?

1119
01:57:42,972 --> 01:57:44,014
She's dead.

1120
01:57:47,226 --> 01:57:50,312
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1121
01:57:50,813 --> 01:57:54,983
- Who did it? Who did it?
- They had Anna, man.

1122
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:56,902
Who had her?

1123
01:57:57,653 --> 01:58:01,281
Waingro.

1124
01:58:01,532 --> 01:58:02,657
On his own?

1125
01:58:04,494 --> 01:58:06,870
- For someone.
- Who?

1126
01:58:07,038 --> 01:58:09,372
The other he worked for.

1127
01:58:11,292 --> 01:58:13,210
Zant.

1128
01:58:15,379 --> 01:58:18,757
- Van Zant?
- Yeah.

1129
01:58:18,925 --> 01:58:20,759
Van Zant.

1130
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:24,012
- Are you sure?
- Van Zant.

1131
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:28,683
Did you say anything
about how we're getting out?

1132
01:58:29,310 --> 01:58:32,354
- I don't think so, Neil.
- Come on.

1133
01:58:34,357 --> 01:58:35,982
I don't remember, Neil.

1134
01:58:41,489 --> 01:58:45,200
- I'll call a medic.
- I'm not gonna make it.

1135
01:58:46,702 --> 01:58:49,746
I can't feel nothing.

1136
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:54,042
My Anna's gone.

1137
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:57,462
She's gone.

1138
01:58:58,881 --> 01:59:03,176
Don't leave me like this, Neil.
Please, holmes.

1139
01:59:04,512 --> 01:59:07,222
Don't leave me like this.

1140
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:32,789
- Yeah?

It's a new one.

1143
01:59:39,422 --> 01:59:42,215
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

- He's with me, at my place.

1146
01:59:49,265 --> 01:59:51,600
Next, Waingro, okay?

1147
01:59:53,728 --> 01:59:54,811
You got the time?

1148
01:59:55,855 --> 01:59:59,149
I'll make time,
and I need a new out laid on.

1149
02:00:00,026 --> 02:00:01,276
How do you know it's blown?

1150
02:00:02,945 --> 02:00:05,071
How can I trust it?

1151
02:00:07,742 --> 02:00:09,618
Okay, you got it.

1152
02:00:09,785 --> 02:00:11,828
Stay healthy.

Our Neil's transportation.
When we're done here, get on the phone.

1156
02:00:25,885 --> 02:00:28,428
Somewhere, someone's trying
to put it together for him.

1157
02:00:28,596 --> 02:00:30,972
You don't believe McCauley
already had a getaway?

1158
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:35,518
Sure he did. Now he needs another one.
Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

1159
02:00:36,562 --> 02:00:38,897
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1160
02:00:39,065 --> 02:00:42,609
He's a CI for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1161
02:00:42,777 --> 02:00:46,321
On Neil McCauley,
how much time we got?

1162
02:00:46,489 --> 02:00:49,866
Eight, 10 hours for him to set up a new out.
After that, he's gone.

1163
02:00:50,034 --> 02:00:51,993
Bye-bye. Bam.

1164
02:01:44,839 --> 02:01:49,259
You ratted McCauley to us.
How'd you know? Who told you?

1165
02:01:49,427 --> 02:01:52,053
Who told you, you rat motherfucker?

1166
02:01:52,221 --> 02:01:53,847
Who?

1167
02:02:21,751 --> 02:02:25,128
Connelly back in for Murphy.
Murphy with Leggat right there with him.

1168
02:02:25,296 --> 02:02:27,088
Murphy tees it up behind the net...

1169
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:34,471
- Miller out front.
Now here's Murphy with the referee...

1170
02:02:38,059 --> 02:02:39,225
Waingro, where is he?

1171
02:02:40,603 --> 02:02:42,854
- Where is he?
- How the hell would I know?

1172
02:03:08,631 --> 02:03:12,550
Well, what do we have here, hmm?

1173
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:16,638
Isn't this pretty? It's pretty. Aah!

1174
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:22,143
- You slimy piece of shit.
- You told me you wanted out from under.

1175
02:03:22,311 --> 02:03:25,480
You're scared to death, right?
You want out? This is out, Charlene.

1176
02:03:25,648 --> 02:03:29,317
- Yeah, what's your end?
- L... You stupid broad.

1177
02:03:29,485 --> 02:03:31,945
- How'd I get into this?
- Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

1178
02:03:32,113 --> 02:03:33,321
- Huh?
- You heard me.

1179
02:03:33,489 --> 02:03:36,533
She had a rough ride.
Why don't you fix her a drink or something?

1180
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:39,702
- Look in the cabinet above the sink.
- Fuck her.

1181
02:03:42,123 --> 02:03:45,250
- You'd better get in there and stay in there.
- All right, all right.

1182
02:03:48,003 --> 02:03:50,255
Well, lookie here.

1183
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:53,716
My name is Sergeant Drucker,
L.A.P.D. Homicide.

1184
02:03:53,884 --> 02:03:57,887
- You wanna put Dominick in the bedroom?
- He stays with me.

1185
02:03:58,389 --> 02:04:00,306
There we go.

1186
02:04:07,898 --> 02:04:09,858
So, what now?

1187
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:15,864
Well, he's right,
because you want out, this is out.

1188
02:04:17,283 --> 02:04:21,161
- You believe you have to betray Chris.
- No shit.

1189
02:04:21,328 --> 02:04:24,289
That's right. You would have to.

1190
02:04:24,457 --> 02:04:28,710
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1191
02:04:29,211 --> 02:04:32,422
Because he becomes an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

1192
02:04:32,590 --> 02:04:35,049
...because you got no living parents
to take him.

1193
02:04:35,217 --> 02:04:39,596
So he ends up state-raised in foster homes,
juvenile facilities.

1194
02:04:39,763 --> 02:04:42,015
Then he steals a car.

1195
02:04:42,266 --> 02:04:47,437
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1196
02:04:47,605 --> 02:04:50,899
Fucked for life.

1197
02:04:51,066 --> 02:04:54,402
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1198
02:04:55,571 --> 02:05:00,742
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life, but Chris did.

1199
02:05:01,827 --> 02:05:05,413
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1200
02:05:05,581 --> 02:05:09,501
You can do it for your kid,
so you can raise him.

1201
02:05:13,672 --> 02:05:17,050
- What else are you selling?
- All kinds of shit.

1202
02:05:17,927 --> 02:05:23,139
But I don't have to sell this and you know it,
because this kind of shit here sells itself.

1203
02:05:29,438 --> 02:05:31,439
DRUCKER [OVER PHONE]:
Okay, Danny, here's an update.

1204
02:05:31,607 --> 02:05:34,943
- Drucker's on Line 2.
- Lieutenant, hold on for a second.

1205
02:05:37,112 --> 02:05:39,239
Lieutenant, I have Drucker
on the other line.

1206
02:05:39,406 --> 02:05:40,782
Oh, well, conference him in.

1207
02:05:42,284 --> 02:05:45,995
- Go ahead.
- Vincent, it's me.

1208
02:05:47,915 --> 02:05:50,542
I want an answer. What's it gonna be?

1209
02:05:57,132 --> 02:05:59,634
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1210
02:05:59,802 --> 02:06:02,971
Okay, that's good. Here's the deal here.

1211
02:06:03,138 --> 02:06:08,977
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life
and become a born-again good citizen.

1212
02:06:09,144 --> 02:06:13,690
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1213
02:06:13,857 --> 02:06:16,609
Waingro used to be a part
of Neil's crew...

1214
02:06:16,777 --> 02:06:20,363
...then he went to work
for a money launderer named Van Zant.

1215
02:06:20,531 --> 02:06:26,327
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak
because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1216
02:06:26,662 --> 02:06:29,998
Now, if Neil goes after anybody else,
it's gonna be Waingro.

1217
02:06:30,165 --> 02:06:33,501
Waingro just got himself a suite
at the airport Marquis...

1218
02:06:33,669 --> 02:06:37,046
...under the name "Jameson."
He's there now.

1219
02:06:37,214 --> 02:06:40,300
I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1220
02:06:40,467 --> 02:06:43,678
...assignment officers
and snitches in County.

1221
02:06:43,846 --> 02:06:46,222
Anyone you can think of
who'll put it on the street.

1222
02:06:46,390 --> 02:06:50,560
Deploy a team at the hotel and personally
check their coms every 30 minutes.

1223
02:06:50,728 --> 02:06:54,814
Because maybe Neil will go for him.
Okay? How you feeling?

1224
02:06:55,524 --> 02:06:58,776
- Banged up, but I'll live.
- Okay.

1225
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:08,036
He's here.

1226
02:07:08,329 --> 02:07:10,538
Neil is still here.

1227
02:07:11,081 --> 02:07:13,041
I can feel it.

1228
02:07:13,292 --> 02:07:15,835
- But for how long?
- Uh...

1229
02:07:16,420 --> 02:07:19,339
Seven, eight hours, max.

1230
02:07:27,723 --> 02:07:29,057
What did you do?

1231
02:07:29,767 --> 02:07:33,478
- That was you?
- It's what I don't do, I don't sell metal.

1232
02:07:33,646 --> 02:07:36,564
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.

1233
02:07:36,732 --> 02:07:40,735
- Now we gotta go together.
- Those other people were with you?

1234
02:07:42,863 --> 02:07:44,989
My friend, Michael...

1235
02:07:46,075 --> 02:07:48,701
...he knew the risks.
He didn't have to be there.

1236
02:07:52,706 --> 02:07:55,333
It rains, you get wet.

1237
02:07:57,378 --> 02:07:58,586
Get packed and let's go.

1238
02:08:05,761 --> 02:08:08,429
Eady.

1239
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:21,442
Why did you do this to me?

1240
02:08:26,949 --> 02:08:28,991
Who are you?

1241
02:08:31,829 --> 02:08:34,956
It's gonna be all right.
You understand? Lt'll be all right.

1242
02:08:39,837 --> 02:08:41,963
It's gonna be all right.

1243
02:08:42,965 --> 02:08:44,590
Right.

1244
02:08:53,183 --> 02:08:56,811
There's this Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

1245
02:09:01,525 --> 02:09:03,568
Here's some cash.

1246
02:09:06,155 --> 02:09:07,321
Whers it over?

1247
02:09:10,826 --> 02:09:12,368
Twenty-two hours from now.

1248
02:09:12,828 --> 02:09:16,539
- Then we get out of here clean.
- When will you let me leave?

1249
02:09:20,461 --> 02:09:23,337
Go now. You want out? There's the door.

1250
02:09:24,006 --> 02:09:26,174
Will you let me leave later?

1251
02:09:31,263 --> 02:09:33,473
It will be different.

1252
02:09:34,516 --> 02:09:36,684
Do you understand?

1253
02:10:07,174 --> 02:10:08,716
It's ready.

1254
02:10:08,884 --> 02:10:10,718
Vincent.

1255
02:10:16,141 --> 02:10:18,309
This is my friend Ralph.

1256
02:10:18,477 --> 02:10:20,436
RALPH:
You didn't tell me you were...

1257
02:10:21,522 --> 02:10:24,398
- Oh, my God.
- Where's Lauren?

1258
02:10:24,566 --> 02:10:27,777
- She's at Lisa-Beth's.
- Look, this has nothing to do with me.

1259
02:10:27,945 --> 02:10:31,864
- I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry.
- What are you sorry about? Sit down.

1260
02:10:32,533 --> 02:10:34,575
Don't you even get angry?

1261
02:10:34,743 --> 02:10:37,245
- I'm angry, yeah.
- Oh.

1262
02:10:37,412 --> 02:10:39,831
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1263
02:10:39,998 --> 02:10:43,084
You know, you can ball my wife
if she wants you to.

1264
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:47,755
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1265
02:10:49,091 --> 02:10:51,384
In her ex-husband's...

1266
02:10:51,552 --> 02:10:56,597
...dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house, if you want to...

1267
02:10:58,433 --> 02:11:04,772
...but you do not get to watch
my fucking television set!

1268
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:06,440
For God's sake.

1269
02:11:12,990 --> 02:11:14,782
Put the television set down.

1270
02:11:14,950 --> 02:11:17,493
- I never cheated on you, bitch.
- Maybe you should have.

1271
02:11:17,661 --> 02:11:19,954
- I should have?
- In a way, you're a party to this.

1272
02:11:20,122 --> 02:11:23,165
Oh, yeah. I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

1273
02:11:23,333 --> 02:11:24,500
Our situation is absurd.

1274
02:11:26,211 --> 02:11:31,048
- Look, maybe I should...
- Shut up, Ralph. Sit down!

1275
02:11:33,135 --> 02:11:37,054
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and explain them to you? What do you do?

1276
02:11:37,222 --> 02:11:41,058
- I say what I mean, and I do what I say.
- Mm, how admirable.

1277
02:11:41,226 --> 02:11:43,311
- You bet.
- Except none of it's about us.

1278
02:11:44,146 --> 02:11:45,187
No.

1279
02:11:46,648 --> 02:11:50,234
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac...

1280
02:11:50,402 --> 02:11:53,029
...but you've been walking
through our life dead.

1281
02:11:53,196 --> 02:11:57,867
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

1282
02:12:10,422 --> 02:12:12,715
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1283
02:12:13,342 --> 02:12:18,179
The plane, charter terminal, LAX,
Hangar 17.

1284
02:12:18,347 --> 02:12:20,097
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1285
02:12:23,477 --> 02:12:27,188
Touches down, holds for you five minutes,
then splits.

1286
02:12:27,356 --> 02:12:30,858
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

1287
02:12:32,861 --> 02:12:35,196
- Hey, where's Chris?
- He's gone.

1288
02:12:36,657 --> 02:12:37,698
What?

1289
02:12:38,325 --> 02:12:40,868
Said he's going on his own.
Went to look for Charlene.

1290
02:12:41,036 --> 02:12:43,871
- Didrt you bring him here?
- Yeah, I brought him here.

1291
02:12:44,331 --> 02:12:46,165
What happened?

1292
02:12:46,333 --> 02:12:48,709
It's a free country, brother.

1293
02:12:53,131 --> 02:12:57,551
Check in with me at 9.
Everything's still cool.

1294
02:12:58,887 --> 02:13:00,554
All right.

1295
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:26,080
I don't even know
what I'm doing anymore.

1296
02:13:28,959 --> 02:13:31,168
I know life is short.

1297
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:34,046
Whatever time you get is luck.

1298
02:13:36,258 --> 02:13:38,342
You wanna walk?

1299
02:13:40,595 --> 02:13:42,888
You walk right now.

1300
02:13:43,974 --> 02:13:46,100
Or on your own...

1301
02:13:46,268 --> 02:13:49,311
On your own,
you choose to come with me.

1302
02:13:55,402 --> 02:13:57,445
All I know is...

1303
02:13:59,239 --> 02:14:03,576
All I know is there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore...

1304
02:14:04,119 --> 02:14:06,203
...if it's gonna be alone...

1305
02:14:07,122 --> 02:14:08,914
...without you.

1306
02:14:15,756 --> 02:14:17,339
Eady.

1307
02:15:07,057 --> 02:15:09,517
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Vincent, I got a live one.

1308
02:15:10,227 --> 02:15:11,852
Okay, I'll hold.

1309
02:15:14,523 --> 02:15:15,898
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.

1310
02:15:17,025 --> 02:15:18,859
- Yeah, do it.
- Shut up!

1311
02:15:23,115 --> 02:15:25,825
Now, just one second at the window...

1312
02:15:26,618 --> 02:15:28,369
...and it's all over.

1313
02:17:18,355 --> 02:17:20,022
Hey, man.

1314
02:17:20,273 --> 02:17:22,233
- Yeah?
- You know any, uh...

1315
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:25,194
...place to rent around here?

1316
02:17:26,279 --> 02:17:27,404
Yeah.

1317
02:17:27,572 --> 02:17:30,157
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell Avenue
got cards on the wall.

1318
02:17:30,325 --> 02:17:31,367
Yeah, thanks.

1319
02:17:42,587 --> 02:17:45,256
It's not him. It's not Chris.

1320
02:17:52,931 --> 02:17:55,057
Unit 2, this is Command.

1321
02:17:55,225 --> 02:17:57,893
Take him at the street and check him out.

1322
02:17:58,061 --> 02:17:59,561
10-4.

1323
02:18:23,003 --> 02:18:24,962
Sergeant?
- Yeah.

1324
02:18:25,130 --> 02:18:27,715
This guy's John Peterson. Valid ID.

1325
02:18:27,882 --> 02:18:31,635
Car's registered to the last name Bukowski,
first name Gene.

1326
02:18:31,803 --> 02:18:34,680
Ran it to DMV. It's clean.

1327
02:18:37,392 --> 02:18:40,227
- Let him go.
- Roger.

1328
02:18:40,395 --> 02:18:42,730
Thank you very much.
Have a good evening.

1329
02:18:44,482 --> 02:18:46,442
It's a no-go, Vince.

1330
02:18:55,535 --> 02:18:58,329
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?

1331
02:18:58,496 --> 02:19:00,581
Yeah, that'd be nice.

1332
02:19:30,570 --> 02:19:32,571
MAN [OVER PHONE]: Yeah?
- Yeah, what do you got?

1333
02:19:32,739 --> 02:19:34,823
Nothing's happening.

1334
02:19:46,127 --> 02:19:49,463
- Yeah?
- Hello, it's Vincent.

1335
02:19:49,631 --> 02:19:50,631
What do you got?

1336
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:55,135
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.
That's it.

1337
02:20:03,478 --> 02:20:05,312
You know what?

1338
02:20:07,315 --> 02:20:09,358
Neil is gone.

1339
02:20:11,569 --> 02:20:13,195
Bam!

1340
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:17,199
- Flying like a bird.
- Come on, Vincent, how do you know?

1341
02:20:19,494 --> 02:20:22,538
- We still got bait. Maybe some time!
- Got, got. What do we got?

1342
02:20:22,705 --> 02:20:24,540
What do we got?

1343
02:20:24,958 --> 02:20:27,626
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1344
02:20:28,336 --> 02:20:30,546
You were good.

1345
02:20:31,631 --> 02:20:33,173
I'm going to the hotel.

1346
02:20:34,592 --> 02:20:37,052
I'm gonna take a shower.

1347
02:20:37,637 --> 02:20:41,140
Gonna sleep for a month.

1348
02:22:51,062 --> 02:22:52,854
Over here.

1349
02:22:59,529 --> 02:23:01,446
Come on, baby.

1350
02:23:03,408 --> 02:23:05,701
Okay, okay.

1351
02:23:09,163 --> 02:23:11,123
Shit.

1352
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,001
Let me tighten this.

1353
02:23:19,507 --> 02:23:21,508
What a fucking waste.

1354
02:23:21,676 --> 02:23:24,011
Okay, here.

1355
02:23:24,846 --> 02:23:30,559
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.
Not you, baby. Not you.

1356
02:23:35,398 --> 02:23:38,859
Where would she be?
Her name is Lauren, Lauren Gustafson.

1357
02:23:39,027 --> 02:23:41,278
I'm supposed to be here with her.
But the police...

1358
02:23:48,202 --> 02:23:51,371
- Help me. I need somebody to help...
- It's okay.

1359
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:54,416
I got you.

1360
02:23:57,045 --> 02:23:58,211
I got you, baby.

1361
02:23:59,547 --> 02:24:02,883
It'll be all right, honey. I swear.
It's okay, baby.

1362
02:24:03,051 --> 02:24:07,095
Let's get a doctor! Let's go!
A doctor here! There's your mama.

1363
02:24:07,263 --> 02:24:09,139
- Let's just calm down.
- Your mama's here.

1364
02:24:09,307 --> 02:24:11,141
- Is she on any drugs?
- No.

1365
02:24:14,062 --> 02:24:16,855
I want you to get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

1366
02:24:17,023 --> 02:24:20,275
I think she cut both arteries.
Also, I could hardly feel her pulse.

1367
02:24:20,443 --> 02:24:23,779
Her pressure's down. So is her respiration.
You have to intubate her.

1368
02:24:23,946 --> 02:24:25,656
It's ready.
- Oh...

1369
02:24:27,158 --> 02:24:30,327
- Whers the last time anybody saw her?
- I don't know.

1370
02:24:30,495 --> 02:24:33,580
- Where did you find her?
- The bathtub.

1371
02:24:33,748 --> 02:24:37,292
Call Respiratory stat. Give her large-bore
normal saline. Wide open.

1372
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:40,587
Let's keep pressure on those bleeders.
I need two units, O-negative.

1373
02:24:40,755 --> 02:24:43,799
- Let's type and cross her for six.
NURSE: Looks like she's in sinus tach.

1374
02:24:43,966 --> 02:24:45,842
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.

1375
02:24:46,010 --> 02:24:47,803
Can you have Respiratory come now?

1376
02:24:47,970 --> 02:24:50,681
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest x-ray.

1377
02:24:55,687 --> 02:25:00,315
Hi. Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room now, okay?

1378
02:25:00,483 --> 02:25:04,653
Her vital signs are stable. The surgeon will be
out to speak to you in a few moments.

1379
02:25:04,821 --> 02:25:06,697
- She's okay?
- She's doing good.

1380
02:25:06,864 --> 02:25:09,032
- She's gonna be okay.
She's gonna be okay.

1381
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:12,077
- Oh, my baby.
- She's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1382
02:25:12,245 --> 02:25:15,372
- It's all right.
- Why'd she do this to herself? Why?

1383
02:25:15,540 --> 02:25:19,751
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1384
02:25:20,795 --> 02:25:22,629
There.

1385
02:25:23,047 --> 02:25:25,966
It's all right, honey.
It's gonna be all right.

1386
02:25:26,134 --> 02:25:28,176
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1387
02:25:28,344 --> 02:25:29,386
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1388
02:25:29,554 --> 02:25:31,638
I ain't going anywhere.

1389
02:25:44,485 --> 02:25:46,945
- Yeah?
- It's me.

1390
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:50,782
Plane's in the air now.
It'll be right on time.

1391
02:25:50,992 --> 02:25:54,995
On the driver's end, I still can't
find nobody, so that's in the trust.

1392
02:25:55,163 --> 02:25:57,038
One other thing.

1393
02:25:57,498 --> 02:25:59,082
You asked, so I gotta tell you.

1394
02:25:59,917 --> 02:26:02,794
The guy you wanted checked into
the Marquis under "Jameson"...

1395
02:26:02,962 --> 02:26:06,339
...if you still give a shit,
which I figured you wouldn't.

1396
02:26:06,507 --> 02:26:10,260
- You figured right.
- So, so long, brother.

1397
02:26:11,971 --> 02:26:13,930
You take it easy.

1398
02:26:14,098 --> 02:26:15,682
You're home free.

1399
02:26:17,435 --> 02:26:19,394
Take it easy.

1400
02:26:29,739 --> 02:26:32,491
- What is it?
- Nothing.

1401
02:26:32,658 --> 02:26:34,201
Home free.

1402
02:27:12,156 --> 02:27:15,075
- I gotta take care of something.
- Is there time?

1403
02:27:16,077 --> 02:27:17,744
There's time.

1404
02:27:46,148 --> 02:27:49,276
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1405
02:28:30,693 --> 02:28:33,153
Regjstration.
- Yeah, this is Room Service.

1406
02:28:33,321 --> 02:28:37,157
A Jameson ordered a BLT. They screwed up
his room number. Could you give it to me?

1407
02:28:37,325 --> 02:28:39,200
- They're always doing that.
- Yeah, I know.

1408
02:28:39,368 --> 02:28:42,454
- 1735.
- Thank you.

1409
02:30:25,933 --> 02:30:27,642
Your attention, please.

1410
02:30:27,810 --> 02:30:31,062
We are currently experiencing
a fire alarm.

1411
02:30:31,230 --> 02:30:34,607
Please do not panic.
Please do not take the elevators.

1412
02:30:38,612 --> 02:30:41,239
Shit.
- Waingro's not moving. I'm staying here.

1413
02:30:41,407 --> 02:30:44,993
I'm checking the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'm pulling you out.

1414
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:51,708
What about her dad?
You want me to call him?

1415
02:30:52,710 --> 02:30:55,545
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1416
02:30:57,006 --> 02:30:59,174
And she chose you.

1417
02:31:01,177 --> 02:31:03,553
She picked your place.

1418
02:31:05,097 --> 02:31:06,556
It's not right, what happened to her.

1419
02:31:08,225 --> 02:31:09,559
No, it's not.

1420
02:31:12,980 --> 02:31:15,023
Ugh, okay.

1421
02:31:25,201 --> 02:31:27,327
Is there any way...

1422
02:31:29,288 --> 02:31:31,790
...that it could work out between us?

1423
02:31:34,168 --> 02:31:36,753
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1424
02:31:36,921 --> 02:31:40,215
But in the end...

1425
02:31:44,678 --> 02:31:46,846
You know, it's like you said:

1426
02:31:49,558 --> 02:31:54,229
All I am, is what I'm going after.

1427
02:32:01,112 --> 02:32:04,030
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1428
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:17,127
Well, go on, if you have to.

1429
02:32:17,294 --> 02:32:18,878
No.

1430
02:32:19,171 --> 02:32:22,382
- I'll stay.
- No, I'm okay. I can... I can handle this.

1431
02:32:25,553 --> 02:32:27,554
Just be careful.

1432
02:32:27,805 --> 02:32:30,557
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1433
02:32:31,475 --> 02:32:33,017
Okay?

1434
02:33:14,894 --> 02:33:15,935
Take the stairs.

1435
02:33:29,909 --> 02:33:30,950
Yeah?

1436
02:33:33,162 --> 02:33:37,332
Security. There's a fire on 3.
We have to evacuate all the floors.

1437
02:33:37,499 --> 02:33:39,125
I can't leave here.

1438
02:33:48,010 --> 02:33:51,429
Why don't we just talk about this a bit,
huh, brother?

1439
02:34:05,444 --> 02:34:06,486
He's here on 17.

1440
02:34:09,657 --> 02:34:11,991
Look at me. Look at me.

1441
02:34:15,329 --> 02:34:16,496
Look at me.

1442
02:34:48,404 --> 02:34:52,282
L.A.P.D. Don't move.
Put your hands on your head, now.

1443
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:29,736
Switch me to TAC 5.

1444
02:35:29,903 --> 02:35:32,238
Casals? JJ?

1445
02:35:33,157 --> 02:35:34,365
Drucker, JJ?

1446
02:35:34,533 --> 02:35:37,076
I'm at the lobby level by the stairwell.

1447
02:35:37,244 --> 02:35:38,244
What have you got?

1448
02:35:38,412 --> 02:35:41,581
Teams are moving up the other
elevators to the 17th floor elevators.

1449
02:35:41,749 --> 02:35:43,916
All out of commission
because of the fire alarm.

1450
02:35:44,084 --> 02:35:47,211
- It's a mess. People everywhere.
- Fine. 10-4.

1451
02:36:17,034 --> 02:36:18,618
Let's go, get out of the way.

1452
02:36:18,786 --> 02:36:20,703
Stay out of the way.

1453
02:36:28,629 --> 02:36:31,672
Let's go. Go that way.
We gotta go, all right? Go, go.

1454
02:36:34,802 --> 02:36:36,719
I got it, sir.

1455
02:36:38,847 --> 02:36:40,765
Come on, come on.

1456
02:36:46,605 --> 02:36:48,231
Come on, sir.

1457
02:36:52,486 --> 02:36:55,488
Watch your backs, ladies.
I got it, I got it.

1458
02:36:58,158 --> 02:36:59,826
Keep moving, ma'am.

1459
02:37:00,661 --> 02:37:01,744
Let's go.

1460
02:37:04,248 --> 02:37:05,498
Come on, let's go.

1461
02:37:40,117 --> 02:37:41,784
This way, ma'am.

1462
02:37:43,745 --> 02:37:45,538
Get back, get back.

1463
02:38:11,398 --> 02:38:13,816
- Let me have that shotgun.
- Yes, sir.

1464
02:44:31,278 --> 02:44:34,029
Told you I'm never going back.

1465
02:44:37,367 --> 02:44:38,993
Yeah.
