1
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:03,885
- Mr. Szpilman?\N- Hello.

2
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:06,595
I came specially to meet you.\NI love your playing.

3
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:10,685
- Who are you?\N- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

4
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:13,370
- You're bleeding!\N- It's nothing.

5
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,540
You can write him a fan letter later.\NThis isn't the best time. Come on.

6
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,300
Jurek, where have you been\Nhiding her?

7
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,260
- I don't know what to take.\N- You always take too much.

8
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,560
How many suitcases are you taking?

9
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,770
What do you think, should I take\Nuncle Szymon's portrait?

10
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,085
Take it, don't take it,\Ntake what you like.

11
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:40,705
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

12
00:02:40,915 --> 00:02:42,665
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

13
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,845
- I should have another case.\N- Mama, Wladek is home!

14
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:51,345
Thank God.\NWladek! You're wounded?

15
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:54,685
- No, it was nothing.\N- I've been worried sick.

16
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:57,435
I told her not to worry.\NYou had your papers on you.

17
00:02:57,605 --> 00:02:59,515
If you'd been hit by a bomb,\Nthey'd know where to take you.

18
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,750
Henryk, don't say things like that.\NGod forbid. God forbid.

19
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,000
- Papa, Wladek is home.\N- What did I tell you?

20
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,630
- What are you doing?\N- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

21
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,550
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.\N- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

22
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,600
Pack, darling.\NGet your things packed.

23
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,850
- Where are we going?\N- Out of Warsaw.

24
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,680
- Out of Warsaw where?\N- You haven't heard?

25
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,495
- Heard what?\N- Haven't you seen the paper?

26
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,205
- Where's the paper?\N- I used it for packing.

27
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:30,915
- She used it for packing.\N- The government has moved to Lublin.

28
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:35,545
All men must leave the city, go across\Nthe river, set up a new line of defense.

29
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:39,675
There isn't anybody left here, only\Nthe women. The men are all gone.

30
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:42,515
What do you think you'll do while\Nthey set up a new line of defense?

31
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:46,015
- Wonder around with your suitcases?\N- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

32
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,990
- I'm not going anywhere.\N- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

33
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,830
Don't be ridiculous,\Nwe've got to keep together.

34
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,380
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to\Ndie in my own home, staying put.

35
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,460
- God forbid.\N- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

36
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,840
...from the BBC in London.\NThe British government...

37
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,390
having received no reply\Nto the observations presented...

38
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,825
to the German government...

39
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:15,995
has declared war on nazi Germany.

40
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:19,955
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!\N- It is expected that...

41
00:04:24,835 --> 00:04:30,055
...within the next few hours, France\Nwill make a similar declaration.

42
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:33,635
Poland is no longer alone.

43
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,040
Wonderful, wonderful!

44
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,670
- Mama, that was a great dinner.\N- It certainly was.

45
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,380
When there's something to celebrate,\Nyou've got to make an effort.

46
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,550
Here's to Great Britain and France!

47
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,550
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?\NAll will be well.

48
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,960
Five thousand and three.

49
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,290
- Is that all?\N- Yes. It's all we've got left.

50
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,670
- It's 3,003 too much.\N- Look.

51
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,260
"Further restrictions\Nregarding liquid assets.

52
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,655
Jews will be allowed to keep a\Nmaximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "

53
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:52,365
- What do we do with the rest?\N- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

54
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:56,325
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough\Nto deposit money in a German bank?

55
00:05:56,495 --> 00:06:01,165
We could hide the money. Look here.\NWe can hide it under the flowerpots.

56
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,425
I'll tell you what we'll do.\NWe'll use try and tested methods.

57
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,045
You know what we did\Nin the last war?

58
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:11,135
We made a hole in the table leg,\Nand hid the money in there.

59
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,780
- Suppose they take the table away?\N- What do you mean?

60
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,580
Germans go into Jewish homes and\Ntake furniture, valuables, anything.

61
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,580
- Do they?\N- Why'd they want a table like this?

62
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,830
- What on earth are you doing?\N- Listen. Look.

63
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,130
This is the best place. No-one would\Nthink of looking under the flowerpot.

64
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,470
- No, listen. I've been thinking...\N- Really? That's a change.

65
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,945
- You know what? We use psychology.\N- We use what?

66
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:42,075
We leave the money and the watch\Non the table, covered. In full view.

67
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:47,835
- Are you stupid?\N- The Germans will never notice it.

68
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:51,965
That's the stupidest thing I've ever\Nseen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

69
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:54,545
Look here.

70
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,635
Idiot.

71
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:59,650
- And you call me stupid.\N- Very good. That's the last place...

72
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,950
- This would take hours.\N- We're not in a hurry.

73
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,370
- It won't take hours.\N- How will you get them out? Tell me.

74
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,620
- How will you get them out?\N- Quiet! Order, please!

75
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,540
- You reach them out individually.\N- No-one listens to me!

76
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,580
Quiet, please, quiet.\NOrder, order, please.

77
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,050
- The lawyer, she likes order.\N- Listen, just listen. Look.

78
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,840
The watch we put under the flowerpot\Nand the money we stuff in the violin.

79
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:29,485
- But I'll still be able to play?\N- You'll find out.

80
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:33,455
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.\N- Wladek, how are you?

81
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:35,705
We're fine, thank you.\NAnd you?

82
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:41,165
Fine, under the circumstances.\NI guess I know why you're calling.

83
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,545
There's nothing we can do.\NThey won't reopen the station.

84
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:50,490
- Yes, I know, but I...\N- No music, no radio for the Polish.

85
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,990
But sure you'll find work.\NA pianist like you.

86
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,620
Maybe, maybe not, but...

87
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,960
don't be offended, but I didn't call\Nto discuss my future carrier.

88
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,380
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,\Nand at last he gave in and said...

89
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,750
"All right, come with me tomorrow",\Nso I came and...

90
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,325
they bombed the station.

91
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,025
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.\N- Really?

92
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:18,695
Yes, it was unforgettable.

93
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:22,495
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.\N- Call me Wladek, please.

94
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:25,955
- No-one plays Chopin like you.\N- I hope it's a compliment.

95
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,835
- Of course, I mean it.\N- I was... trying to be funny.

96
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:34,335
- Should we go and have a coffee?\N- I'd like that.

97
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,610
- And you, what do you do?\N- I finished with the conservatoire.

98
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,780
- You're a musician?\N- Yes. But only just.

99
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,570
- What instrument?\N- The cello.

100
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,370
I love to see women\Nplaying the cello.

101
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,790
JEWS FORBIDDEN

102
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,250
This is disgraceful.\NHow dare they?

103
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,284
You know what people are like, they\Nwant to be better nazis than Hitler.

104
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:03,355
- I'm going in there to complain.\N- It's better not, believe me.

105
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:06,865
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!\N- Good-bye.

106
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:13,665
We'll find somewhere else.

107
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:17,165
- We can walk in the park.\N- No, we can't.

108
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,705
Official decree.\NNo Jews allowed in the park.

109
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:24,020
- My God. Are you joking?\N- I'm not joking, it's true.

110
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,110
We could sit in a bench, but\N"no Jews allowed on public benches".

111
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,150
This is absurd.

112
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,280
We can just stand here and talk.\NI think we're allowed to do that.

113
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,830
So, you play the cello. That's nice.\NAnd who's your favorite composer?

114
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,380
Chopin? Really? Well...

115
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,475
you'll have to learn to play\Nhis cello sonata, won't you?

116
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:50,815
What about you, Wladek?

117
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:53,985
Perhaps I could accompany.\NMe on the piano, you on the cello.

118
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:58,535
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,\Nquite wonderful.

119
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:02,825
Call me Wladek, please.

120
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,705
"Free emblems for Jews\Nin the Warsaw district.

00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,835

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,070
Does it say that we have to provide\Nthese armbands ourselves?

135
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,040
- Where will we get them?\N- We're not going to wear them.

00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,110
Go to the gutter.

142
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:20,435
- Have you seen this?\N- What? What? I'm working. What?

143
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:23,735
What is this?

144
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:28,655
- It's where they're going to put us.\N- What do you mean "put us"?

"By order of the governor of the\NWarsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

00:13:50,225 --> 00:13:54,145
- But it's a Bechstein!\N- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

163
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:57,355
What are you going to do when\Nyou're hungry? Eat the piano?

164
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:00,355
- Get out!\N- What's the matter with you?

165
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:02,485
- Stop it!\N- We'd rather give it away. Get out!

166
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:05,865
Haven't you eaten today?\NWhat are you suffering from?

167
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,735
You people are crazy.

168
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:12,930
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand\Nand I'm paying for the removal.

169
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,720
I'm not even charging\Nfor the removal!

170
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,180
You haven't eaten today.\NYou're crazy.

171
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,230
Take it.

172
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:57,445
Hello.

173
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:00,880
Hello. Hi.

174
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,300
I didn't want to come.

175
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,100
I didn't want to see all this, but...\NI couldn't stop myself.

176
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,230
- How are you doing?\N- Fine.

177
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
Good.

178
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,320
No, not really.\NThey arrested my cousin.

179
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,900
Jurek says they'll let him out.

180
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,715
- This is disgraceful.\N- It won't last long. Don't worry.

181
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,885
That's what I said myself.

182
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:32,765
It's too absurd.

183
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:39,935
I... I should go.

184
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:44,735
Well, I'll see you...

185
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:46,680
soon.

186
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,470
Good-bye.

187
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,780
Well...

188
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,045
to tell you the truth,\NI thought it would be worse.

189
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:24,685
- Where will we sleep?\N- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

190
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:27,895
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

191
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:31,445
Look.

192
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:34,962
Come and look.

193
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:09,175
Go away.

194
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:11,635
Go away! Go away!

195
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:15,895
Papa! Papa!

196
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,180
- Sell anything?\N- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

197
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,020
- 3 zlotys.\N- It's better than yesterday.

198
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,480
Three lousy zlotys. And there are\Npeople there making millions.

199
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,360
- I know.\N- You don't know, believe me.

200
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,955
They bribe the guards,\Nthe guards turn a blind eye.

201
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:53,965
They bring cartloads of food,\Ntobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

202
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,965
And the poor are dying all around\Nand they don't give a damn.

203
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:59,975
Excuse me, have you seen\Nmy husband, Izaak Szerman?

204
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:04,395
A tall handsome man,\Nwith a little gray beard.

205
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:09,145
- I'm afraid not.\N- Excuse me. Good-bye.

206
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:13,000
Sleep well. But if you see him,\Nwrite to me, yes?

207
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,250
Izaak Szerman.

208
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,480
Why do we have to have a gentile\Nstreet running through our area?

209
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,835
Why can't they go around?

210
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:39,755
Don't worry. They're about to build\Na bridge. Haven't you heard?

211
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,675
A bridge! Those idiots.

212
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:46,465
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

213
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:50,175
But do you know what I think?\NI think they're totally stupid.

214
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:53,395
I have a family to feed.\NI spend half of my time here...

215
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:55,855
waiting for them to let us through.

216
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:59,290
Maybe they think I come here\Nto listen to the music?

217
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,670
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?\N- What's wrong with you?

218
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,170
- Come on, do something.\N- Right. Dance!

219
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,130
- Dance!\N- Dance!

220
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,260
Come on, come on! Dance!

221
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,310
Very well.

222
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,463
What about you?\NDance with him.

223
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:28,205
Let's clear the street,\Nso the Jews can dance.

224
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,795
Come on. And you.

225
00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:41,595
Go on.

226
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:44,105
Faster!

227
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,950
Come on!

228
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
Faster!

229
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,250
Come on!

230
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,760
Faster!

231
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,680
Come on, move! I said faster!\NCome on, Jews!

232
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,884
- Keep dancing.\N- Dance.

233
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:30,385
Good, they're here.

234
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:35,030
Itzak Heller has been\Nwaiting for you.

235
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,790
- What's this about?\N- Sit down, have tea.

236
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,460
I'll start lunch\Nwhen the girls get here.

237
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,680
- So, what are you doing here?\N- He brought cakes.

238
00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:00,495
His father is back in the jewellery\Nbusiness. He's doing well.

239
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:05,455
Amazing, jewellery.

240
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:08,045
- We're recruiting.\N- Who is recruiting?

241
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:10,715
Don't be clever with me.\NI'm coming as a friend.

242
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:13,135
They're bringing Jews in\Nfrom all over the country.

243
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:15,385
Soon there will be half million people\Nin the ghetto.

244
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:19,555
- We need more Jewish police.\N- More Jewish police!

245
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:23,240
You want me to beat up Jews\Nand catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

246
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,990
- Someone has got to do it.\N- But why me?

247
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,580
I thought you only recruited boys\Nwith rich fathers.

248
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,790
Look at my father, look at us...

249
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,130
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm\Nhere. You can have a better life.

250
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,760
- You want to survive selling books?\N- Yes, please.

251
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,340
I'm doing you people a favor.

252
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,300
What about you?\NYou're a great pianist.

253
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,945
We've got a police jazz band.\NThey'd welcome you with open arms.

254
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:50,325
- Join us. You've got no work.\N- Thank you, I've got work.

255
00:22:39,535 --> 00:22:41,495
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

256
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:46,455
Who wants me to stop?

257
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:39,505
I always say,\Nlook on the bright side.

258
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,135
You're in a small ghetto with\Nintellectuals, professional people.

259
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:46,860
You're better off than us. Here in\Nthe large ghetto it's a cesspool.

260
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,200
- You have to give me something.\N- You're an artist...

261
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,450
you keep peoples' spirits up.\NYou do enough.

262
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,200
- I want to help, do something.\N- You're too well known.

263
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:01,330
And you know what? You musicians\Ndon't make good conspirators.

264
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,670
You're too... too musical.

265
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:12,615
- Who is that?\N- Symche.

266
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:14,985
Majorek.

267
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:19,205
There are notices going up. City is\Nto be cleansed of the undesirables.

268
00:24:19,405 --> 00:24:22,415
- There's always notices going up.\N- Hello, Symche.

269
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,795
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

270
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:30,625
Jehuda, working hard?

271
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:34,770
This is the greatest pianist in\NPoland. Maybe the whole world.

272
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,900
Wladyslaw Szpilman,\Nmeet Majorek.

273
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,950
- How do you do?\N- I know your name.

274
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,660
- I've never heard you play.\N- Majorek used to be in the Army.

275
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,870
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got\Nagainst him is he's not a socialist.

276
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,630
You better go now, Wladek.\NIt's nearly curfew.

277
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,580
You know how many copies\Nwe print of our newspaper?

278
00:24:57,994 --> 00:24:59,775
Five hundred.

279
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:03,275
You know how many people on\Naverage read one copy? Twenty.

280
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:08,115
That makes 10 thousand readers.\NThis will start the uprising.

281
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:11,575
Majorek hides them in his underpants\Nand leaves them in toilets.

282
00:25:11,785 --> 00:25:14,625
- Toilets?\N- As many toilets as I can find.

283
00:25:14,835 --> 00:25:17,375
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

284
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:19,585
They're too clean for them.

285
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,320
Please, mister, please.

286
00:25:56,365 --> 00:25:59,865
Hold it!\NYou little bastard!

287
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:04,835
Take this!

288
00:26:04,995 --> 00:26:07,045
Stop it! Stop it!

289
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:09,042
Stop it!

290
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,980
Come on, come on.\NCome on, boy.

291
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,990
Stand up! Stand up.

292
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:59,560
Please, tonight for once, I don't\Nwant anything bad talked about.

293
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,310
- Enjoy your meal.\N- Then I'll tell you something funny.

294
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,530
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?\N- The surgeon.

295
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,570
The Germans allowed him into\Nthe ghetto to perform an operation.

296
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,950
On a Jew? They let a Pole\Nto come in to operate on a Jew?

297
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,580
He got a pass, that's all I know.\NAnyway, so...

298
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,163
he puts the patient to sleep\Nand starts the operation.

299
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:23,645
He'd just made the first incision\Nwhen the SS burst in...

300
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:28,435
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja\Nand everybody else who was there.

301
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:33,235
Isn't that a laugh?

302
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:37,365
The patient didn't feel a thing,\Nhe was anesthetized.

303
00:27:37,535 --> 00:27:39,365
I said nothing bad.

304
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:43,785
What's the matter with you all?\NYou lost your sense of humor?

305
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:46,640
It's not funny.

306
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,270
You know what's funny? You're\Nfunny, with that ridiculous tie.

307
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,650
What are you talking about? What's\Nmy tie have to do with anything?

308
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,110
- I need this tie for my work.\N- Your work?

309
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,610
- That's right, I work.\N- Playing the piano for the parasites.

310
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,990
- Parasites...\N- Boys. Boys!

311
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,750
- They don't give a damn.\N- And you blame me for their apathy?

312
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,435
I see it everyday. They don't even\Nnotice what's going around them.

313
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:13,605
- I blame the Americans.\N- For what? For my tie?

314
00:28:14,185 --> 00:28:16,985
The American Jews,\Nand there are lots of them.

315
00:28:17,985 --> 00:28:21,275
What do they think they're doing?\NPeople here are dying.

316
00:28:21,485 --> 00:28:23,775
Haven't got a bite to eat.

317
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:29,285
The Jewish bankers should persuade\NAmerica to declare war on Germany.

318
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,360
The lights! The lights!

319
00:29:06,225 --> 00:29:10,485
Turn on the lights.

320
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:15,865
Come on!

321
00:29:18,745 --> 00:29:23,100
Open the door!\NWe want to go in!

322
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,930
Open the door!

323
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,820
Stand up!

324
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:48,555
You, stand up! Come on!

325
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:51,765
Throw him out!

326
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:07,115
Mama...

327
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,900
Come on, run!

328
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:34,065
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.\N- Go in. Not you.

329
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,970
- What?\N- Come. It's terrible.

330
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,310
- What?\N- They're hunting people in the streets.

331
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,770
They've taken Henryk.

332
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,400
Go home, alright? Go home,\NI'll take care of it.

333
00:32:18,055 --> 00:32:21,725
Excuse me. Have you seen\Nmy husband? Izaak Szerman?

334
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:25,815
- I'm afraid not.\N- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

335
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:29,735
If you see him, write to me.\NDon't forget. Izaak Szerman.

336
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,470
What happened here?

337
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,430
They've got my grandson. They\Npick them up and take them away.

338
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,350
What they do to them,\NI've stopped believing in God.

339
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,060
Excuse me. Excuse me.

340
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,980
Itzak?

341
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:58,085
Itzak?

342
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:01,795
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

343
00:33:08,095 --> 00:33:10,595
- Henryk is in there.\N- I haven't seen him.

344
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,975
Believe me.\NThey picked him up.

345
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:21,299
- Can you help?\N- Now you need me. Now you need me!

346
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,710
Can you help us?

347
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,090
- It costs.\N- I have no money.

348
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,890
Then there's nothing I can do.\NYou should have joined us.

349
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,510
- They told me you had influence.\N- Who told you?

350
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,270
People I know. They said\Nyou're an important man.

351
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,400
Itzak...

352
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:02,225
- Hands up.\N- How are you?

353
00:34:02,435 --> 00:34:06,145
- How are you?\N- You, bandit.

354
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:08,517
Dead! Dead!

355
00:34:08,725 --> 00:34:11,920
- He's crazy.\N- Hands up.

356
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,260
- Want a cigarette?\N- Cigarette?

357
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Thank you.

358
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:23,430
Everything is alright!

359
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,770
He looks very happy.

360
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,850
Everything is alright.

361
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,472
Everything is alright.

362
00:34:33,006 --> 00:34:36,585
Hands up! Hands up!

363
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:38,465
It's alright.

364
00:34:40,255 --> 00:34:42,465
Help! Help!

365
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:46,305
Let go! Help!

366
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:43,015
- Why did they pick you up?\N- So you go to Itzak Heller?

367
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,750
- Did I ask you to talk to him?\N- You're out, aren't you?

368
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,880
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?\N- I asked him to help you.

369
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,760
What did you pay him?

370
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:00,220
With what could I pay him? Every\Nzloty I earn we spend on food.

371
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,470
- I can look after myself.\N- They were taking you away.

372
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,600
It's got nothing to do with you.\NIt's me they wanted, not you.

373
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,125
Why do you have to interfere\Nwith other people's business?

374
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:15,455
- You're mad. That's your trouble.\N- That's also my business.

375
00:36:24,675 --> 00:36:28,015
What's the matter?\NAre you sick?

376
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:31,475
Hungry.

377
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:43,000
Employment certificate. What's that\Nmean, no employment certificate?

378
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,050
You have to have an\Nemployment certificate...

379
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,840
to work for the Germans\Nin the ghetto, otherwise...

380
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,890
- Otherwise what?\N- You'll be deported.

381
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,430
- So the rumors were true.\N- They're going to resettle us...

382
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:59,455
and send us to labor camps,\Nin the East.

383
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:04,375
- They're closing the small ghetto.\N- Oh, God!

384
00:37:19,683 --> 00:37:21,582
Wladek? Wladek?

385
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,540
I thought you were on tour playing\Nin London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

386
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,540
- Not this week.\N- You look terrible.

387
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,710
Have you heard the rumors? They're\Ngoing to resettle us in the East.

388
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,050
Rumors! You take it all too much\Nto heart. What's the trouble?

389
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,680
I've been trying to get the certificate\Nof employment for my father.

390
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:45,251
I managed to get one for me and my\Nfamily, but I need one for my father.

391
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:48,665
- I've been to all the firms and shops...\N- Why didn't you come to me?

392
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:51,035
I didn't know you were\Nin the certificate business.

393
00:37:51,245 --> 00:37:53,705
I'm not, but Majorek is.

394
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:58,005
Can you help?\NI have no money.

395
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,595
Please, don't insult us.\NCan you do something for him?

396
00:38:01,795 --> 00:38:04,215
Be at the Schultz workshop\Ntomorrow, four o'clock.

397
00:38:04,505 --> 00:38:07,175
See what a wonderful piece\Nof luck you've had today?

398
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:11,240
That's the historical imperative in\Naction! That's why I always say:

399
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,830
- "Look on the bright side!"\N- Yes, I know.

400
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,550
- How's your back?\N- Better.

401
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,756
Better?

402
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:33,905
Better not ask.

403
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:52,095
- Thank you.\N- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

404
00:38:54,555 --> 00:38:56,869
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

405
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:10,815
At least we got work\Nin the ghetto.

406
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:14,195
At least we are still together.

407
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:30,885
Everybody out!\NTo the courtyard!

408
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:33,442
Move, move!

409
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:38,410
We are workers. We have\Nemployment certification.

410
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,330
Wait.

411
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Here.

412
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,500
Go over there. Hurry.

413
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,710
You.

414
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,800
You. You.

415
00:40:56,575 --> 00:40:58,355
You.

416
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:01,985
You.

417
00:41:03,405 --> 00:41:05,575
You.

418
00:41:14,415 --> 00:41:17,835
The others, put your clothes on\Nand come back here.

419
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:21,233
Bring your things with you.\N15 kilos only.

420
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:24,360
Where are you taking us?

421
00:41:48,065 --> 00:41:50,615
I'm sorry, I did my best.

422
00:41:52,985 --> 00:41:55,995
- I thought the certificates'd save us.\N- Stop it, Wladek.

423
00:41:56,155 --> 00:41:59,785
Let's just hope that Henryk\Nand Halina will be better off.

424
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,630
- Where will we be going?\N- You're going to work.

425
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,188
You'll be much better off than\Nin the stinking ghetto. Move.

426
00:42:37,815 --> 00:42:41,775
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

427
00:42:42,485 --> 00:42:47,865
Why did I do it?\NWhy did I do it?

428
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:52,705
Why did I do it?

429
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:38,575
Don't you have a bottle of water?\NHe's dying.

430
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:40,705
My child is dying of thirst.

431
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:42,794
- I beg you.\N- I'm sorry.

432
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:46,850
- Don't you have water? I beg you.\N- Can you hear what I'm saying?

433
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,360
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.\N- I can hear you.

434
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,900
Letting them take us to our death\Nlike sheep to the slaughter.

435
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,240
- Not so loud.\N- Why don't we attack them?

436
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,610
There's half a million of us here.\NWe can break out of the ghetto.

437
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,530
At least we can die honorably, not\Nas a stain on the face of History.

438
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,450
Why are you so sure they're\Nsending us to our death?

439
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,250
You know why I'm not sure?\NBecause they didn't tell me.

440
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:10,475
- They're going to wipe us all out.\N- What do you want me to do? Fight?

441
00:44:10,685 --> 00:44:13,315
To fight, we need organization,\Nplans, guns.

442
00:44:13,475 --> 00:44:16,145
He's right. Do you think I'm going\Nto fight with my violin bowl?

443
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:19,195
The Germans would never squander\Na huge labor force like this.

444
00:44:19,735 --> 00:44:21,825
They're sending us to a labor camp,\Nit's obvious.

445
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:23,405
Sure.

446
00:44:23,575 --> 00:44:27,995
Look at that cripple, the old people,\Nthe children. They're going to work?

447
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:31,983
Look at you. You're going to carry\Nlogs on your back?

448
00:45:13,905 --> 00:45:17,245
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

449
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,570
I missed you.\NI wanted to be with you!

450
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,906
I wanted to be with you!

451
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:45,176
Stupid. Stupid.

452
00:45:45,555 --> 00:45:49,805
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

453
00:45:49,975 --> 00:45:53,275
She's getting on my nerves.

454
00:45:57,275 --> 00:46:02,235
- What did she do, for God's sake?\N- She smothered her baby.

455
00:46:04,245 --> 00:46:07,773
They prepared a hiding place\Nand of course they went there.

456
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:10,850
The baby cried\Njust as the police came.

457
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,230
She smothered the cries with\Nher hands, the baby died.

458
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,270
A policeman heard the death rattle\Nand found where they were hiding.

459
00:46:45,395 --> 00:46:47,695
What are you reading?

460
00:46:50,115 --> 00:46:54,989
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?\NIf you tickle us, do we not laugh?

461
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:57,390
If you poison us, do we not die?

462
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:00,720
And, if you wrong us,\Nshall we not revenge?"

463
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:11,860
- Very appropriate.\N- Yes. That's why I brought it.

464
00:47:29,685 --> 00:47:33,315
Idiot. What does he think\Nhe's gonna do with the money?

465
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:37,145
Boy, come here.

466
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:39,695
Come here.

467
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,028
- How much for a caramel?\N- 20 zlotys.

468
00:47:43,812 --> 00:47:46,680
For one caramel? What do you think\Nyou're gonna do with the money?

469
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,180
20 zlotys.

470
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,930
We've got 20 between us.

471
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,690
I've got 10, I think.

472
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,230
5, 10, 20.

473
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,680
- Halina?\N- What?

474
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:32,010
- It's a funny time to say this, but...\N- What?

475
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,560
I wish I knew you better.

476
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:41,320
Thank you.

477
00:49:57,685 --> 00:49:59,395
Szpilman?

478
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,500
Papa? Papa?

479
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,300
Mama? Halina?

480
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,470
Halina? Mama?

481
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:25,100
What do you think you're doing?\NI've saved your life. Just go! Go!

482
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,011
Don't run!

483
00:50:32,588 --> 00:50:34,665
Anna!

484
00:50:34,835 --> 00:50:37,215
Anna!

485
00:50:56,871 --> 00:51:00,040
Off they go to the melting pot.

486
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:07,840
- This stays.\N- Give it to me!

487
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,690
What are you doing?\NShe's pregnant.

488
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,498
Wladek?

489
00:54:02,675 --> 00:54:05,763
Why are you here, Wladek?

490
00:54:05,971 --> 00:54:08,661
It's like this, I...

491
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,250
We...

492
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,460
All of them, all of them.

493
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,880
All of them.

494
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,970
Perhaps they're lucky.\NThe quicker, the better.

495
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,340
It's not finished yet. We'll stay\Nhere for a couple of days...

496
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,551
until things die down.

497
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:34,245
I've bribed the policeman,\Nhe'll come when it's over.

498
00:54:36,455 --> 00:54:40,205
Attention!\NOn the march!

499
00:54:50,215 --> 00:54:52,175
Onward!

500
00:54:54,546 --> 00:54:57,660
My God, I haven't been outside in,\Nit must be two years.

501
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,870
Don't get overexcited.

502
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,030
It's gold.\NVery good price.

503
00:55:41,095 --> 00:55:43,042
Someone you know?

504
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:45,200
A beauty.\NWho is she?

505
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:49,490
She's a singer. I knew her well.\NHer husband is an actor.

506
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,160
They're good people.\NI'd like to talk to her.

507
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:56,210
Don't forget, Wladek.\NThey hang them for helping Jews.

508
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,425
Turn left!

509
00:56:25,585 --> 00:56:28,085
On the march!

510
00:56:32,243 --> 00:56:35,030
Stop! Halt!\NAttention!

511
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,290
At ease.

512
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,170
Turn right!

513
00:56:59,325 --> 00:57:02,035
Step forward.

514
00:57:02,575 --> 00:57:04,155
You.

515
00:57:06,415 --> 00:57:08,995
You. You.

516
00:57:09,705 --> 00:57:11,545
You.

517
00:57:15,505 --> 00:57:17,581
Down on the ground!

518
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,900
Down on the ground!

519
00:57:48,155 --> 00:57:50,285
Turn left!

520
00:57:51,445 --> 00:57:53,905
On the march.

521
00:58:33,895 --> 00:58:36,155
How long have you been here?

522
00:58:36,355 --> 00:58:39,275
Since last night.

523
00:58:39,485 --> 00:58:41,905
I was pleased to see you.

524
00:58:45,825 --> 00:58:49,165
They're going to start\Nthe final resettlement now.

525
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:53,332
We know what it means.

526
00:58:54,404 --> 00:58:58,320
We sent someone out.\NZygmund, a good man.

527
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:04,320
His orders were to follow\Nthe trains out of Warsaw.

528
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,870
He got to Sokolow.

529
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:12,830
A man told him the tracks divided,\None branch's leading to Treblinka.

530
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:18,449
He said everyday freight trains\Ncarrying people from Warsaw...

531
00:59:18,658 --> 00:59:22,645
branch off to Treblinka\Nand return empty.

532
00:59:22,815 --> 00:59:25,855
No transports of food\Nare ever seen on that line.

533
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:30,115
The civilians are forbidden\Nto approach the Treblinka station.

534
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:36,455
They're exterminating us.

535
00:59:40,295 --> 00:59:42,940
It won't take them long.

536
00:59:44,311 --> 00:59:47,900
We are 60 thousand left,\Nout of half a million.

537
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,280
Mostly young people.

538
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,610
And this time we're gonna fight.

539
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:00,160
We're in good shape.

540
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:04,330
Organized.\NWe're prepared.

541
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,362
If you need help, I...

542
01:00:26,825 --> 01:00:30,155
You! Come here!

543
01:00:31,188 --> 01:00:32,980
Shit!

544
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:43,400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

545
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:47,070
I don't know what I was thinking.

546
01:00:56,306 --> 01:01:00,725
Take this! Take this!

547
01:01:15,365 --> 01:01:18,194
Take him away.

548
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:37,490
I hope you play the piano better\Nthan you carry bricks.

549
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,742
He won't last long\Nif he goes on like this.

550
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:44,845
I'll see if I can get him\Nsomething better.

551
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,260
Trouble.

552
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,980
Round up only the Jews!

553
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:15,150
Round up!\NOnly the Jews.

554
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,820
The Polish keep working.\NOnly the Jews.

555
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:29,076
I have good news for you.

556
01:02:29,275 --> 01:02:34,185
There are rumors going around\Nthat we like to...

557
01:02:34,385 --> 01:02:37,305
to resettle you.

558
01:02:39,225 --> 01:02:44,275
I promise you that now\Nand in the future...

559
01:02:44,485 --> 01:02:48,075
nothing else is planned.

560
01:02:49,075 --> 01:02:55,396
For this reason, we put\Ninformation posters on the wall.

561
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,060
To show you our goodwill...

562
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:04,190
you should vote one of you\Nto be allowed...

563
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:07,440
to go in town daily...

564
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:14,030
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

565
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,725
and one loaf of bread\Nfor each of your workers.

566
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:24,345
So, why should we do something\Nlike this if we'd resettle you?

567
01:03:25,555 --> 01:03:30,935
You can make good business\Nout of the things you don't eat.

568
01:03:32,435 --> 01:03:38,115
Isn't that something that you Jews\Nare good in? Making money?

569
01:03:42,064 --> 01:03:43,226
Dismiss them.

570
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:03,530
That one, with the string.\NThe others, tied by wire.

571
01:05:12,185 --> 01:05:13,355
Now!

572
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:52,845
Majorek.

573
01:05:54,555 --> 01:05:57,515
I have a favor to ask.

574
01:05:58,145 --> 01:06:00,525
I want to get out of here.

575
01:06:03,235 --> 01:06:07,712
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll\Nsurvive on the other side that's hard.

576
01:06:07,921 --> 01:06:10,210
I know.

577
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:14,890
Last summer, I worked for a day\Nin the Zelazna Brama Square.

578
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:18,600
I saw someone I knew,\Nshe's an old friend.

579
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,270
A singer, her husband\Nis an actor.

580
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:27,900
I've filled their names down and\Ntheir address, if they're still there.

581
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:33,005
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej\NBogucki. They're good people.

582
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:36,965
Would you try to make contact?

583
01:06:38,055 --> 01:06:43,805
You go to town everyday. Ask them\Nif they'd help me get out of here.

584
01:07:16,725 --> 01:07:19,419
Have you got any plaster?

585
01:07:28,755 --> 01:07:32,055
What are you up to?

586
01:07:33,635 --> 01:07:36,185
What have you got there?

587
01:07:36,395 --> 01:07:40,352
We are allowed to take\Nfood to the ghetto.

588
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,374
Three kilos of potato and bread.

589
01:07:43,543 --> 01:07:45,670
Open it.

590
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:54,430
- It's only potatoes and bread.\N- You're lying. That's not true.

591
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,010
Open it.

592
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,142
Potatoes!

593
01:08:31,751 --> 01:08:34,790
You Jews are all alike.

594
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,710
We reach you with a finger...

595
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,920
and you take the whole hand.

596
01:08:55,209 --> 01:08:59,585
If you lie to me again,\NI'll kill you. Personally.

597
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,830
I've tried your friends.

598
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,420
- They don't live there anymore.\N- Did you make contact?

599
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,090
- Be ready to leave.\N- When?

600
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,220
- Soon.\N- Halt!

601
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:37,810
Shit! Shit!

602
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,674
Wait. What's going on here?

603
01:09:40,882 --> 01:09:44,535
Take this! Take this!

604
01:09:50,795 --> 01:09:54,835
I'll teach you some discipline,\Nyou dirty Jews.

605
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:01,555
Do you know why\Nyou're being hit?

606
01:10:01,725 --> 01:10:04,887
- No.\N- Do you know why you're being hit?

607
01:10:05,086 --> 01:10:09,620
- Why?\N- To celebrate New Year.

608
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:14,170
On the march!

609
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,000
March and sing!

610
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,170
Sing something nice!

611
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,880
Loud and clear!

612
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,718
Reunite tonight\NAnd follow the white eagle

613
01:10:27,927 --> 01:10:32,035
Stand up and fight\NOur mortal enemies

614
01:10:32,205 --> 01:10:36,085
Rise on the day\NLet's give them fire and brimstone

615
01:10:36,245 --> 01:10:40,255
We'll do away\NThe Yoke of slavery

616
01:10:40,415 --> 01:10:44,215
Punish and rout\NThe rapists of our nation

617
01:10:44,385 --> 01:10:48,555
We'll slash them out\NTo save our dignity

618
01:11:22,155 --> 01:11:24,205
Come.

619
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,370
I'm sorry.

620
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:43,330
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

621
01:13:08,335 --> 01:13:11,295
We haven't much time.\NCome on.

622
01:13:18,984 --> 01:13:20,860
We must hurry.

623
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,360
Here. See if this fit.

624
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:27,700
We have to keep moving you. Germans\Nare hunting down indiscriminately.

625
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:31,160
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

626
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:35,290
You better shave.\NUse my razor on the shelf.

627
01:13:50,155 --> 01:13:53,115
You'll be looked after\Nby Gebczynski.

628
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:55,375
He's on the other side of town.

629
01:13:55,495 --> 01:13:59,375
You stay there tonight,\Nthen we'll find you somewhere else.

630
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:04,288
- I'll bring you food.\N- Alright, let's go.

631
01:14:43,575 --> 01:14:46,495
I'll show you where\Nyou're going to sleep.

632
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,775
You have to stay here\Nuntil tomorrow afternoon.

633
01:15:19,985 --> 01:15:24,905
We have a flat for you near\Nthe ghetto wall. But it's safe.

634
01:15:32,205 --> 01:15:34,705
It's not going to be very comfortable.

635
01:15:35,245 --> 01:15:37,245
I'll be fine.

636
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:49,320
Thank you.

637
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:07,396
Here. Here. Give it to me.

638
01:16:08,065 --> 01:16:12,025
Go as near to the front as possible,\Nto the German section.

639
01:16:30,356 --> 01:16:32,140
DO NOT PASS

640
01:17:03,445 --> 01:17:05,985
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

641
01:17:11,495 --> 01:17:15,242
But you leave them open\Nduring the day. Don't forget.

642
01:17:18,187 --> 01:17:21,560
Must feel better on\Nthis side of the wall, eh?

643
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,310
Yes.

644
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,150
But sometimes I'm still not sure\Nwhich side of the wall I'm on.

645
01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:34,660
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

646
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:38,290
I'll come again.\NJanina will visit you twice a week.

647
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:40,948
To bring more food,\Nsee how you are.

648
01:17:41,276 --> 01:17:43,435
Thank you.

649
01:17:45,725 --> 01:17:48,985
This is very important.\NIn case of emergency...

650
01:17:49,185 --> 01:17:53,485
I mean emergency,\Ngo to this address.

651
01:18:35,975 --> 01:18:38,185
What do you mean you forgot?

652
01:18:38,355 --> 01:18:41,355
What do you think I mean?\NI forgot, that's what I mean.

653
01:18:41,485 --> 01:18:47,075
- You know, you treat me like dirt.\N- Because you are a dirt.

654
01:18:47,285 --> 01:18:49,745
- Pig! Pig!\N- Bitch!

655
01:18:49,945 --> 01:18:52,733
- Dirty pig!\N- You are a dirty pig!

656
01:18:52,942 --> 01:18:55,640
Takes one to know one. Pig.

657
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:04,560
- You play like an angel.\N- Then why don't you listen?

658
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,980
- I'm listening.\N- Liar.

659
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:10,490
You fell asleep. Pig.

660
01:19:31,815 --> 01:19:35,865
Spread out!\NWe're being attacked!

661
01:19:38,365 --> 01:19:40,773
Take cover!

662
01:19:42,434 --> 01:19:43,430
Shoot!

663
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,400
Take cover! Fire!

664
01:20:02,569 --> 01:20:05,355
Come on, get out!

665
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:35,110
The attack was successful.

666
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:39,354
That building...

667
01:21:47,095 --> 01:21:49,175
Turn that way!

668
01:21:55,895 --> 01:21:57,815
Shoot!

669
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,020
Thank you.

670
01:22:27,144 --> 01:22:30,379
- I wanted to come earlier, but...\N- No, thank you.

671
01:22:34,465 --> 01:22:38,265
No-one thought\Nthey'd hold out so long.

672
01:22:38,425 --> 01:22:40,975
I never should've come out. I should\Nhave stayed and fought with them.

673
01:22:41,185 --> 01:22:44,645
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

674
01:22:44,805 --> 01:22:47,725
Just be proud of them.

675
01:22:47,935 --> 01:22:51,478
- My God, did they put up a fight!\N- Yes.

676
01:22:53,508 --> 01:22:56,340
- So did the Germans.\N- They are in shock!

677
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:02,300
They didn't expect it. Nobody\Nexpected it. Jews fighting back.

678
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:07,310
- Who would have thought?\N- What good did it do?

679
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:09,520
What good?

680
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:12,150
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

681
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:17,134
They died with dignity.\NAnd you know something else?

682
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:22,215
Now the Poles will rise.\NWe are ready.

683
01:23:22,425 --> 01:23:25,805
We'll fight too.\NYou'll see.

684
01:23:40,054 --> 01:23:42,712
Get your things together.\NYou have to leave.

685
01:23:42,921 --> 01:23:45,550
What? What's happened?

686
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:50,260
- I'm on the run.\N- What's happened?

687
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:54,600
The Gestapo found our weapons.\NThey've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

688
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:59,350
They're bound to find out about this\Nplace too. You must get away at once.

689
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,979
Where do you want me to go?

690
01:24:02,148 --> 01:24:05,672
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

691
01:24:06,707 --> 01:24:10,125
- Can I take my chances here?\N- That's your decision.

692
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:13,085
But when they storm the flat,\Nthrow yourself out the window...

693
01:24:13,295 --> 01:24:15,135
don't let them get you alive.

694
01:24:15,305 --> 01:24:18,555
I have poison on me.\NThey won't get me alive either.

695
01:27:34,465 --> 01:27:36,765
Open up!

696
01:27:39,416 --> 01:27:43,740
Open the door\Nor we'll call the police!

697
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:15,705
Are you from this flat?\NYou're not registered.

698
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:19,165
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just\Ncame to visit, but I missed him.

699
01:28:19,335 --> 01:28:21,795
Have you got your identity card?

700
01:28:22,425 --> 01:28:25,384
- Let me see your identity card.\N- Yes, of course.

701
01:28:28,042 --> 01:28:30,531
- I want to see your identity card!\N- What's happening?

702
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:33,410
He's a Jew! A Jew!

703
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:35,490
Stop the Jew!

704
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:39,210
Don't let him out!\NStop him!

705
01:29:52,455 --> 01:29:56,705
- Yes?\N- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

706
01:30:02,827 --> 01:30:06,860
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.\N- Dorota.

707
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:10,160
Come in.

708
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,750
I'm sorry.

709
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,460
I was given this address and\NI'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

710
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:26,334
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

711
01:30:26,503 --> 01:30:28,246
Come in.

712
01:30:36,195 --> 01:30:38,205
Sit.

713
01:30:41,165 --> 01:30:43,535
I need help.

714
01:30:45,335 --> 01:30:48,255
He'll be back before curfew.

715
01:30:48,415 --> 01:30:51,036
I've been in hiding.

716
01:30:52,201 --> 01:30:55,730
- I need somewhere to stay.\N- He'll be here soon.

717
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:01,070
- How long have you been married?\N- Just over a year.

718
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:06,500
And how is Jurek?

719
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,410
Dead.

720
01:31:15,081 --> 01:31:18,895
- When is your baby due?\N- Christmas.

721
01:31:19,565 --> 01:31:23,365
This is not a good time to\Nhave children, but then...

722
01:31:25,615 --> 01:31:29,075
This is my husband.\NWladyslaw Szpilman.

723
01:31:29,245 --> 01:31:34,085
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.\N- Yes, I remember.

724
01:31:35,955 --> 01:31:38,657
He said to contact you\Nonly in case of emergency.

725
01:31:38,866 --> 01:31:40,738
Don't worry now.

726
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:53,910
We can't move you tonight.\NYou'll sleep on the sofa.

727
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:00,420
Excuse me.

728
01:32:04,365 --> 01:32:07,395
I'm sorry,\Ncould I have a piece of bread?

729
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:10,355
Yes, of course.\NWe will eat.

730
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:14,655
Sit. Please, sit.

731
01:32:14,865 --> 01:32:16,655
Thank you.

732
01:34:24,699 --> 01:34:27,736
You're on a very German area.

733
01:34:27,946 --> 01:34:32,355
On the opposite is a hospital taking\Nwounded from the Russian front.

734
01:34:34,225 --> 01:34:37,565
And next door is the\NSchutzpolizei.

735
01:34:38,985 --> 01:34:41,315
Safest place to be.

736
01:34:41,525 --> 01:34:44,445
Right at the heart\Nof the lion's den.

737
01:34:49,531 --> 01:34:51,731
I'll be locking you in.

738
01:34:51,901 --> 01:34:55,930
No-one knows you're here,\Nso keep as quiet as possible.

739
01:37:05,395 --> 01:37:07,355
All well?

740
01:37:07,895 --> 01:37:10,195
Thank you.

741
01:37:14,396 --> 01:37:18,220
This is Antek Szalas.\NHe'll be looking after you.

742
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:20,220
- How do you do?\N- How do you do?

743
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:22,220
Thank you.

744
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:27,430
I've given him a second key. He'll\Nbring food, see that you're alright.

745
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:30,560
He's with the underground,\Nhe's a good man.

746
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:38,849
- You don't remember me?\N- I don't think so.

747
01:37:39,058 --> 01:37:42,555
Warsaw Radio.\NI was a technician.

748
01:37:43,135 --> 01:37:46,305
I saw you almost everyday.

749
01:37:46,885 --> 01:37:50,345
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.\N- It doesn't matter.

750
01:37:52,605 --> 01:37:56,315
You've nothing to worry about.\NI'll visit often.

751
01:37:57,145 --> 01:37:59,945
You'll be pleased to hear that\Nthe Allies are bombing Germany...

752
01:38:00,105 --> 01:38:02,147
night after night,\Nafter night.

753
01:38:02,356 --> 01:38:04,846
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

754
01:38:05,095 --> 01:38:08,380
And the Russians are giving them\Nhell. It's the beginning of the end.

755
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:10,180
Let's hope so.

756
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:23,270
Come here.

757
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,644
Be careful with it.

758
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:29,508
That's it. Be careful.

759
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:59,090
Still alive then?

760
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:06,600
Here. Sausage, bread.

761
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:09,020
You still got that vodka?

762
01:39:23,345 --> 01:39:27,305
- How long is this meant to last?\N- Not long now.

763
01:39:27,845 --> 01:39:31,015
I think I've got jaundice.

764
01:39:31,225 --> 01:39:35,065
Don't worry about that.\NIt just makes you look funny.

765
01:39:36,144 --> 01:39:40,178
My grandfather was jilted by\Nhis girlfriend when he got jaundice.

766
01:39:40,387 --> 01:39:42,290
Drink up.

767
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:46,170
Why didn't you come sooner?\NIt's been over two weeks...

768
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,180
Problems.

769
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:50,470
Money.

770
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:53,510
I've got to raise money\Nto buy the food.

771
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:57,600
I need things to sell,\Nit's not easy.

772
01:40:01,474 --> 01:40:04,133
Here. Sell this.

773
01:40:06,465 --> 01:40:08,675
Food is more important than time.

774
01:40:13,885 --> 01:40:17,015
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!\NThe Allies have landed in France.

775
01:40:17,225 --> 01:40:19,515
Russians will be here soon.

776
01:40:19,975 --> 01:40:22,975
They'll beat the shit\Nout of the Germans...

777
01:40:23,815 --> 01:40:25,847
any day now.

778
01:41:09,725 --> 01:41:11,765
Wladek?

779
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:24,090
I knew it.\NI knew this would happen.

780
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:28,680
- I'll get a doctor.\N- You can't. It's too dangerous.

781
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,560
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.\N- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

782
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:35,180
- He's still a doctor.\N- No.

783
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:38,589
You stay. I'll go.

784
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:14,510
We came to say goodbye.

785
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:17,720
We're going to stay\Nwith my mother in Otwocks.

786
01:42:17,930 --> 01:42:21,260
The baby is already there.\NIt's safer.

787
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:25,552
There's talk that the uprising\Nwill begin any day now.

788
01:42:26,837 --> 01:42:29,826
That man Szalas should be shot.

789
01:42:30,375 --> 01:42:34,545
He's been collecting money\Non your behalf all over Warsaw.

790
01:42:35,335 --> 01:42:40,385
Apparently people gave generously,\Nso he collected a tidy sum.

791
01:42:44,715 --> 01:42:47,555
My God.

792
01:42:50,713 --> 01:42:56,040
The liver the size of a football.\NInflammation of the gall bladder...

793
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:59,170
but he'll leave.

794
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:05,460
I'll try to get him some laevulose,\Nbut it's not easy.

795
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:09,340
- Can you visit him again?\N- Who knows.

796
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:13,671
- Doctor, thank you.\N- Don't speak, rest.

797
01:43:17,208 --> 01:43:19,785
Thank you so much for coming.

798
01:43:21,415 --> 01:43:23,665
We've brought you some food.

799
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:27,715
I'll prepare something now\Nfor you, then we must go.

800
01:44:09,245 --> 01:44:11,585
I'll throw a grenade!

801
01:44:19,835 --> 01:44:22,385
There's a wounded man over there!

802
01:44:22,885 --> 01:44:25,417
Come.

803
01:44:25,547 --> 01:44:27,957
Watch out! Watch out!

804
01:44:29,073 --> 01:44:32,030
- I'll go get help!\N- Hurry!

805
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:36,710
Come on! Bring the litter!

806
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:43,170
Go back inside!

807
01:46:32,115 --> 01:46:34,785
Get out, get out in the streets!

808
01:46:34,995 --> 01:46:38,785
Get out now! The Germans\Nhave surrounded the building!

809
01:47:19,815 --> 01:47:24,115
Somebody...\NSomebody help me!

810
01:48:21,955 --> 01:48:25,117
Are you alright?\NThere's too much dust.

811
01:48:25,495 --> 01:48:30,060
I'll check this side.\NDon't worry.

812
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:32,730
Be careful!

813
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:40,830
- Heinrich?\N- I'm checking!

814
01:48:43,370 --> 01:48:45,910
Is there anybody here?

815
01:48:49,988 --> 01:48:54,105
- Come on down!\N- Alright, I'm coming.

816
01:53:02,065 --> 01:53:03,895
Come on, pile them up.

817
01:53:10,235 --> 01:53:12,437
Throw it.

818
01:54:36,595 --> 01:54:39,555
We have to mark everything.

819
01:54:40,605 --> 01:54:41,565
Come on.

820
02:01:42,325 --> 02:01:44,705
What are you doing here?

821
02:01:49,165 --> 02:01:51,505
Who are you?

822
02:01:55,625 --> 02:01:59,208
- Do you understand?\N- Yes.

823
02:02:01,292 --> 02:02:03,574
What are you doing?

824
02:02:09,330 --> 02:02:11,330
I was...

825
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:14,540
trying to open this can.

826
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:17,880
Do you live here?

827
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:22,256
Do you work here?

828
02:02:22,456 --> 02:02:24,160
No.

829
02:02:27,828 --> 02:02:30,325
What do you do for a living?

830
02:02:33,365 --> 02:02:35,165
I am...

831
02:02:36,785 --> 02:02:39,795
I was a pianist.

832
02:02:41,875 --> 02:02:44,125
Pianist?

833
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:04,870
Come.

834
02:03:29,795 --> 02:03:32,045
Play something.

835
02:08:50,890 --> 02:08:53,685
Are you hiding here?

836
02:08:58,435 --> 02:09:00,105
Jew?

837
02:09:03,105 --> 02:09:05,525
Where are you hiding yourself?

838
02:09:07,155 --> 02:09:09,152
In the attic.

839
02:09:12,392 --> 02:09:14,725
Show it to me.

840
02:09:38,182 --> 02:09:40,465
Have you got anything to eat?

841
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:32,345
According to them,\Nit's very important that...

842
02:10:39,065 --> 02:10:40,855
Attention!

843
02:10:42,565 --> 02:10:45,610
- At ease.\N- At ease.

844
02:11:50,770 --> 02:11:52,770
Jew?

845
02:12:07,175 --> 02:12:08,635
Please.

846
02:12:09,055 --> 02:12:11,095
What does it mean,\Nall that shooting?

847
02:12:11,635 --> 02:12:14,395
The Russians,\Non the other side of the river.

848
02:12:15,765 --> 02:12:19,225
You just have to hold on\Na couple of weeks, not more.

849
02:13:50,635 --> 02:13:53,435
- What's going on?\N- We're leaving.

850
02:13:56,353 --> 02:13:59,673
- Are the Russians here?\N- Not yet.

851
02:14:02,585 --> 02:14:06,460

Thank God, not me.

853

858
02:14:49,707 --> 02:14:51,502
Tell me your name.

859

02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:56,670
Szpilman.

861
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:03,760
Perfect name for a pianist.

862
02:16:25,916 --> 02:16:28,580

863
02:16:51,706 --> 02:16:54,375

He's Polish.

02:17:21,410 --> 02:17:23,670
Yes, he's Polish.

871
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:27,380
Why the fucking coat?

872
02:17:28,460 --> 02:17:30,720

You took my violin,\Nyou took my soul.

879

Musician?

880
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:20,875
Are you a musician?

881
02:18:21,832 --> 02:18:23,996
Do you know...

882
02:18:24,325 --> 02:18:27,486
a pianist called Szpilman,\Nfrom the Polish radio station?

883
02:18:27,695 --> 02:18:32,915
- Of course I know him.\N- I helped him to hide himself.

884
02:18:33,705 --> 02:18:35,835
Tell him I'm here.

885
02:18:36,625 --> 02:18:38,795
Ask him to help me.

886
02:18:41,875 --> 02:18:44,631

It was here, I'm certain of it.

889
02:20:32,660 --> 02:20:34,820
Well, it's not here now.

890
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:39,160
I shouted, abused them. I'm not\Nproud of it, but that's what I did.

891
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:40,830
I stood where you are now.

892
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:45,373
There was a barbed wire\Nand this German came up to me.

893
02:20:46,699 --> 02:20:50,359
