1
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,312
<i>My name is Turkish.</i>

2
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,591
<i>Funny name for an Englishman, I know.</i>

3
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,150
<i>My parents were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.</i>

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,556
<i>They named me after the plane.</i>

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,189
<i>Not many people are
named after a plane crash.</i>

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,313
<i>That's Tommy.</i>

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,670
<i>He tells people
he was named after a gun.</i>

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,716
<i>But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th century ballet dancer.</i>

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,710
<i>Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.</i>

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,554
<i>Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.</i>

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,958
<i>It means I try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me.</i>

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,953
<i>I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.</i>

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,595
<i>But really, he's like my brother.</i>

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,750
<i>What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.</i>

15
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,476
<i>I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then:</i>

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,830
<i>What do I know about diamonds?</i>

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,631
<i>Don't they come from Antwerp?</i>

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,677
<i>-Himy, would you listen to this?
-Do we have a choice?</i>

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,475
<i>It wasn't meant to be taken literally.</i>

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,399
<i>It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.</i>

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,596
<i>It's bound with moral fibre...</i>

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,316
<i>...but asking a grown man
to believe it?</i>

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,474
<i>What is it?</i>

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,073
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,877
<i>What you want I should do,
drop my pants?</i>

26
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,673
<i>Okay, go through.</i>

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,956
<i>It's a nice story.</i>

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,473
<i>It's just that. Just a story.</i>

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,991
<i>Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.</i>

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,589
<i>Enough already. Ruben, say something.</i>

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,314
<i>Listen. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story.</i>

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,599
<i>The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for ''young woman''...</i>

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,916
<i>... into the Greek word for ''virgin. ''</i>

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,469
<i>It was an easy mistake to make...</i>

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,077
<i>...because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.</i>

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,710
<i>So, they came up with a prophecy:</i>

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,993
<i>''Behold, the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son. ''</i>

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,119
<i>You understand? It was ''virgin''
that caught people's attention.</i>

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,393
<i>It's not everyday a virgin conceives
and bears a son.</i>

40
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,879
<i>But leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew...</i>

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,550
<i>...and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic Church.</i>

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,798
<i>Oy vay, what are you saying?</i>

43
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,508
<i>I'm saying, just because
it's written...</i>

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,233
<i>... doesn't make it so.</i>

45
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,229
<i>Gives them hope. It's not important
whether it's fact or fiction.</i>

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,795
<i>-People like to believe.
-I don't want to hear anymore.</i>

47
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,157
<i>Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?</i>

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,358
<i>-Michael.
-Hello?</i>

49
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,189
<i>Mutti.</i>

50
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,950
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

51
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,712
<i>Rud, it's okay, let them through.</i>

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,915
-Michael.
-Mutti.

53
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,631
<i>You've kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?</i>

54
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,279
Lie down on the floor.

55
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,869
Get on the floor!

56
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,749
Lie on the floor!

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,632
Get on the fucking floor!

58
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,114
-Get down!
-Get fucking down!

59
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,517
Down on the floor! Get down!

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,949
On the ground!

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,718
Get down, I say!

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,911
-Time.
-Seven minutes!

63
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,709
Where is the stone?

64
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,838
Where is the stone?

65
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,834
Where is the stone?

66
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,313
Michael, where is the stone?

67
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,951
When does your plane leave?

68
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,152
Twenty minutes.

69
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,359
Give me your gun.

70
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,351
When you get to London...

71
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,352
...if you want a gun...

72
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,394
...call this number.

73
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,915
-Boris.
-Boris.

74
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,194
He can get you anything you need.

75
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,837
Is he allowed to do that?

76
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,233
<i>It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.</i>

77
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,476
These lads are out
to hurt each other.

78
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,957
<i>What's with those sausages,
Charlie?</i>

79
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,753
Two minutes, Turkish.

80
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,949
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

81
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,639
<i>We'll need a proper office.</i>

82
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,718
<i>I want a new one.
You're going to buy it for me.</i>

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,479
Why me?

84
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,997
Well, you know about caravans.

85
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,593
<i>How's that?</i>

86
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,117
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.

87
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,437
<i>And I don't want to have me pants
pulled down over the price.</i>

88
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,948
<i>What's wrong with this one?</i>

89
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,398
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

90
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,398
<i>It's tiptop.</i>

91
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,358
<i>I'm just not sure about the colour.</i>

92
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,555
<i>It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.</i>

93
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,519
<i>Here's an address.</i>

94
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,559
<i>It's a campsite.</i>

95
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,949
<i>You've got 10 grand, and
it would be nice to see change.</i>

96
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,757
<i>-What's happening with them sausages?
-Five minutes.</i>

97
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,388
It was two minutes five minutes ago.

98
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,198
<i>They ain't pikeys, are they?</i>

99
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,994
I fucking hate pikeys.

100
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,748
<i>You're a sensitive boy, Tommy.</i>

101
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,351
Fuck me. Hold tight.

102
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,314
<i>-What's that?
-It's me belt.</i>

103
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,795
<i>No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.</i>

104
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,038
<i>-What's a gun doing in your trousers?
-It's for protection.</i>

105
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,429
Protection from what?

106
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,438
<i>''Zee'' Germans?</i>

107
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,717
<i>What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit?</i>

108
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,032
-Where did you get it?
-Boris The Blade.

109
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,669
You mean Boris the sneaky,
fucking Russian.

110
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,833
<i>Heavy, isn't it?</i>

111
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,630
Heavy is good.

112
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,995
Heavy is reliable.

113
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,754
<i>If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.</i>

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,958
<i>Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.</i>

115
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,357
<i>Bent as the Soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it.</i>

116
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,479
<i>Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.</i>

117
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,270
<i>Back to my partner, Tommy.</i>

118
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,278
<i>Tommy runs the other business...</i>

119
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,073
<i>... the slot machines...</i>

120
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,716
<i>... which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.</i>

121
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,112
<i>However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.</i>

122
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,513
<i>All right, I'll take it.</i>

123
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,510
<i>There's a reason for Tommy's newfound
enthusiasm for firearms.</i>

124
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,032
<i>Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing,
you have to deal with that reason:</i>

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,469
<i>Brick Top.</i>

126
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,228
<i>If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.</i>

127
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,438
<i>-He doesn't look bad, does he?
-No, he looks great.</i>

128
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,039
<i>He'll do you proud.</i>

129
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,199
<i>You reckon that's what people should
do for me, Gary? Do me proud?</i>

130
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,429
<i>It's what you deserve.</i>

131
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,955
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.

132
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,109
Dogs do that.

133
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,512
<i>You're not a dog, are you?</i>

134
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,119
<i>No. No, I'm not.</i>

135
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,709
However...

136
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,030
...you do have all the characteristics
of a dog, Gary.

137
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,469
All except loyalty.

138
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,958
<i>It's rumoured that his favourite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun...</i>

139
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,199
<i>...a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.</i>

140
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,635
<i>You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I'll give you that.</i>

141
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,394
But I got no time for grouses.

142
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,391
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.

143
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,956
What the fuck are you two looking at?

144
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,918
<i>If you got to deal with him, just
make sure you don't end up owing him.</i>

145
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,354
<i>Then you're in his debt.</i>

146
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,716
<i>Which means, you're in his pocket.</i>

147
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,197
<i>And once you're in that,
you ain't ever coming out.</i>

148
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,798
<i>I hear he's a good fighter,
so I'll use him.</i>

149
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,156
<i>I'll be doing you a favour, boy.</i>

150
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,153
<i>What he means is,
I'm doing him a favour.</i>

151
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,669
<i>Because everybody knows nobody takes
a dive in my fights. Unlike his.</i>

152
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,437
<i>Here, Errol, I don't think
he likes me.</i>

153
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,079
<i>You don't like me, do you?</i>

154
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,588
<i>Don't know what you mean.</i>

155
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,713
<i>I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. It stinks.</i>

156
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,991
My fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out.

157
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,390
<i>Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.</i>

158
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,989
<i>You can sort me out by showing me out.</i>

159
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,953
<i>It's hard to make a living
in boxing, so now and then...</i>

160
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,634
<i>...you do something
against your principles.</i>

161
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,753
<i>Basically, you have to forget
you got any.</i>

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,353
Are they Lancashire pigs?

163
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,033
<i>Who's talking to you?</i>

164
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,478
<i>Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.</i>

165
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,829
<i>Don't let me down.</i>

166
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,315
<i>You don't want to let me down, do you?</i>

167
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,317
See you ringside.

168
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,833
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers...

169
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,634
...has a diamond the size of a fist.

170
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,356
<i>I have told you it's in the briefcase
connected to his arm.</i>

171
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,716
I sent him to you to buy a gun.

172
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,633
What more do you want me to do,
hit him for you?

173
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,155
<i>But don't you hit him either.</i>

174
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,352
<i>Americans can't know it was Russian.</i>

175
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,198
It will come back to me.

176
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,191
<i>You're my brother, so think like it.</i>

177
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,310
Get somebody else to steal that stone!

178
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,551
<i>I don't want it getting back to me.</i>

179
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,559
<i>And don't have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.</i>

180
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,472
<i>So don't use idiots for the job.</i>

181
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,196
<i>He'll stay in London a couple of
days before he goes to New York...</i>

182
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,749
...so move quick. Okay?

183
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,799
One more thing.

184
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,559
It might help.

185
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,752
He loves to gamble.

186
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,993
Eighty-six carats?

187
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,111
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.

188
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,273
A beautiful stone.

189
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,515
<i>You're a good boy, Franky.</i>

190
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,718
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?

191
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,556
I got to move the two-grainers here,
get a better price. Couple of days.

192
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,189
-Talk to my cousin Dougie.
-Doug The Head?

193
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,836
And Franky....

194
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,471
<i>-And what?
-Stay out of those casinos.</i>

195
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,392
<i>You did a good job, bubbe.</i>

196
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,433
<i>-Don't go screwing it up, all right?
-I hear you, Avi.</i>

197
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,951
<i>I'll see you, Avi.</i>

198
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,314
Eighty-six carats.

199
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,118
-Where?
-London.

200
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,879
-London?
-London.

201
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,031
-London?
-Yes, London.

202
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,474
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea...

203
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,752
...bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

204
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,635
Not for me.

205
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,878
<i>That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.</i>

206
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,515
<i>If it's stones and it's stolen,
he's the man to speak to.</i>

207
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,034
<i>Pretends he's Jewish.</i>

208
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,753
<i>Wishes he was Jewish.</i>

209
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,116
<i>Even tells his family
they're Jewish...</i>

210
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,517
<i>...but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.</i>

211
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,554
<i>He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business...</i>

212
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,075
<i>-... it is good for business.
-Avi!</i>

213
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,311
<i>He'll be there today.
Take care of him.</i>

214
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,068
<i>Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.</i>

215
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,834
<i>He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.</i>

216
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,071
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

217
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,038
<i>We play by the rules.</i>

218
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,554
Listen to me.

219
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,957
<i>If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?</i>

220
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,949
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.</i>

221
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,119
What are you doing here?

222
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,112
<i>It's a free country, isn't it?</i>

223
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,115
<i>Well, it ain't a free shop, is it?</i>

224
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,118
So fuck off.

225
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,874
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

226
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,118
I had cousin Avi on the phone.

227
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,994
-You got to go see him.
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.

228
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,431
<i>-He's a big mucker in New York.
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.</i>

229
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,035
I want to see you girls
up in my office.

230
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,635
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

231
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,388
The weight is sign of reliability.

232
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,156
I always go for reliability.

233
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,557
<i>I'll take it.</i>

234
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,313
How much do you want for it?

235
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,675
Nothing.

236
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,317
Okay, so what do you want for it?

237
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,039
I want you to do something for me.

238
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,792
There is a fight in couple of days.

239
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,519
What kind of a fight?

240
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,352
Unlicensed boxing.

241
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,559
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

242
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,152
If you place one down for me...

243
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,193
...we will call it quits.

244
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,630
<i>-Why don't you put it down yourself?
-Well...</i>

245
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,034
...there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

246
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,270
And I already have an outstanding
debt with the house.

247
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,834
<i>I know something most don't.</i>

248
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,159
<i>So, nu?</i>

249
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,759
What do you know?

250
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,879
<i>It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.</i>

251
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,998
-Ten points.
-What are we doing here?

252
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,917
<i>-We're buying a caravan.
-Off a pack of fucking pikeys?</i>

253
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,953
<i>What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.</i>

254
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,990
<i>Not if you're here.</i>

255
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,992
Oh, you bastard.

256
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,629
I fucking hate pikeys.

257
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,879
<i>That's a flash car, mister.</i>

258
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,519
Not as flash as your bike.

259
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,597
Who are you looking for?

260
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,034
<i>Mr. O'Neil.</i>

261
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,910
<i>-Want me to get him?
-That's a good lad.</i>

262
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,832
Piss off.

263
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,228
-Are you going to go get him for me?
-Yeah.

264
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,072
<i>-What are you waiting for?
-The five quid you'll pay me.</i>

265
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,918
<i>Fuck off, I'll find him meself.</i>

266
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,355
-Two fifty.
-You can have a quid.

267
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,079
<i>You're a real tight fucker.</i>

268
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,276
<i>There was a problem with gypsies.</i>

269
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,913
<i>What're you doing?
Get out of the way, man.</i>

270
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,116
<i>You can't understand
what's being said.</i>

271
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,879
You Tommy? Come about the caravan?

272
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,270
<i>-Mr. O'Neil.
-Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.</i>

273
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,999
<i>Not Irish, not English.</i>

274
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,396
<i>-How are you?
-Weather's been kind.</i>

275
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,272
<i>It's just Pikey.</i>

276
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,558
Would you look at the size of him?

277
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,553
How big are you?

278
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,711
-Kids, how big is he?
-Big, for sure.

279
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,474
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size
of this fella.

280
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,512
<i>Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.</i>

281
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,434
<i>Get out of the way.
See if they'd like a drink.</i>

282
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,908
I could murder one.

283
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,078
<i>Be no murdering done around here,
I don't mind telling you.</i>

284
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,231
Get your hands out of there.

285
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,999
Cup of tea for the big fella?

286
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,232
<i>Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.</i>

287
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,789
You little bugger.

288
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,077
<i>-Is the big fella not coming with us?
-He's minding the car.</i>

289
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,955
-What does he think we are, thieves?
-No, nothing like that.

290
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,192
-He just likes looking after cars.
-Good dags. Do you like dags?

291
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,149
-Dags?
-What?

292
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,396
-Yeah, dags.
-Dags. You like dags?

293
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,552
Oh, dogs.

294
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,438
Sure, I like dags.

295
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,353
<i>-I like caravans more.
-You're very welcome.</i>

296
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,875
<i>Pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.</i>

297
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,037
<i>It's probably why
they talk like that...</i>

298
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,311
<i>...so you can't follow
what's being said.</i>

299
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,836
<i>But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked...</i>

300
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,350
<i>... on his return
there will be ice cream.</i>

301
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,312
Good dog, good family.

302
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,120
<i>He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.</i>

303
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,154
See you later, lads. See you, boss.

304
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,470
All right, Mickey. Laters.

305
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,313
<i>I don't see what the fuss is about.</i>

306
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,228
<i>They aren't bad fellas.</i>

307
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,156
The deal was, you bought it
how you saw it.

308
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,358
<i>Look, I've helped you as much
as I'm going to help you.</i>

309
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,358
See that car? Use it.

310
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,070
You should fuck off now while
you still got the legs to carry you.

311
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,159
Nobody brings you...

312
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,153
<i>...unless they're trying
to say something without talking.</i>

313
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,878
Just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan.

314
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,038
<i>Why do I want a caravan
that's got no wheels?</i>

315
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,272
-You want to settle this with a fight?
-Over my dead body.

316
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,788
Now, go on! Go on!

317
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,834
<i>I'll not have you fighting!
You know what happens when you fight!</i>

318
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,759
Get her to sit down.

319
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,959
<i>For fuck's sake!</i>

320
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,592
<i>Want the money?
I ain't fucked you.</i>

321
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,270
<i>I'll fight you for it. You and me.</i>

322
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,950
<i>So that's the kind of fight
it'll be.</i>

323
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,312
You want to stay down.

324
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,519
You want to stay down!

325
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,835
Get back down and fucking stay down.

326
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,395
I promise you, you want to stay down.

327
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,631
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

328
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,797
Cheeky bastard.

329
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,232
-Okay, lads.
-Get him on his feet.

330
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,629
Get back down...

331
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,553
...or you will not be coming up
next time.

332
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,790
Bollocks to you.

333
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,118
<i>This is sick. I'm out of here.</i>

334
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,789
<i>You're not going anywhere,
you thick lump.</i>

335
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,837
<i>You stay until the job's done.</i>

336
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,036
<i>It turned out that the sweet-talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey...</i>

337
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,953
<i>... was a gypsy bare-knuckle
boxing champion.</i>

338
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,794
<i>Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.</i>

339
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,116
<i>Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.</i>

340
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,954
<i>If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes...</i>

341
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,356
<i>... Tommy knows he'll be buried
with him.</i>

342
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,514
<i>Why would the gypsies
want to explain...</i>

343
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,836
<i>... why a man died in their campsite?</i>

344
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,152
<i>Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.</i>

345
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,756
<i>It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?</i>

346
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,230
<i>Tommy, ''The Tit''...</i>

347
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,038
<i>... is praying.</i>

348
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,508
<i>And if he isn't...</i>

349
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,711
<i>...he fucking should be.</i>

350
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,515
Bad Boy.

351
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,792
-Sol.
-Easy.

352
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,674
<i>No, it's a moissanite.</i>

353
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,796
A what?

354
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,272
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

355
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,509
<i>It's Mickey Mouse.</i>

356
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,435
Spurious.

357
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,599
Not genuine.

358
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,678
<i>And it's worth...</i>

359
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,155
...fuck-all.

360
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,233
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

361
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,238
Leave this game to me and Sol.

362
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,789
Laters.

363
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,475
What is that, Vince?

364
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,358
This is a dog, Sol.

365
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,670
You are not bringing
that thing in here.

366
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,512
<i>It's only a fucking dog.</i>

367
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,239
<i>-Where'd you get it?
-The gyppos.</i>

368
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,515
Here.

369
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,478
They threw it in with the moody gold.

370
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,150
<i>You know gyppos, Sol. They're always
throwing dogs in with deals.</i>

371
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,594
It better not be dangerous.

372
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,437
<i>What do you think you're doing now?</i>

373
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,673
<i>I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?</i>

374
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,119
Stop the dog!

375
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,509
Come back!

376
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,434
All right, Boris?

377
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,318
<i>-Don't worry about the dog.
-I'm not.</i>

378
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,999
What can I do for you?

379
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,439
I have a job for you.

380
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,318
I already have a job.

381
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,873
<i>Fifty grand for half a day's work.</i>

382
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,155
Go on.

383
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,551
I want you to hold up a bookies.

384
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,838
From Russia with love, eh?

385
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,796
I have stones to sell...

386
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,032
...fat to chew and many men
to see about many ducks...

387
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,759
...so if I am not rushing you....

388
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,631
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

389
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,028
I am not in Rome, Doug.

390
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,872
I am in a rush.

391
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,679
I got to make the bookies.

392
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,069
Bookies?

393
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,196
-What are you betting on?
-Bomber Harris.

394
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,278
The unlicensed boxer?

395
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,797
<i>Do you know something that I don't?</i>

396
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,752
<i>Bubbe, I probably know
a lot you don't.</i>

397
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,515
<i>He's bad to the bone,
ain't you, Tyrone?</i>

398
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,909
Of course I am.

399
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,789
<i>Tyrone'll drive for us. He's
done a rally driving course.</i>

400
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,189
Of course I have.

401
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,553
<i>I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.</i>

402
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,233
Your seats?

403
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,630
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.

404
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,712
<i>While I'm at the wheel, it's my car...</i>

405
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,158
...so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

406
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,153
<i>I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?</i>

407
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,038
It went back to the gyppos.

408
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,874
Shut up.
And how could it find them?

409
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,232
<i>Well, I don't know.
I'm not a dog, Sol.</i>

410
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,034
Ask him.

411
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,837
<i>It's like he's
a fucking homing beacon.</i>

412
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,829
Steady on the brakes.

413
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,233
I thought you said
he could drive, Sol.

414
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,115
<i>Don't worry about me. Just worry
about that dog on my seats.</i>

415
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,799
All right?

416
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,669
What?

417
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,630
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?

418
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,599
<i>Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.</i>

419
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,319
Worry about getting us a gun.

420
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,435
<i>What's that?</i>

421
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,794
This is a shotgun, Sol.

422
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,713
<i>It's a fucking
anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.</i>

423
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,748
<i>-I want to raise pulses, don't I?
-You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.</i>

424
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,630
That does not look like a bookies.

425
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,913
<i>Why'd we stop here? What's the
matter with that space over there?</i>

426
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,952
<i>It's too tight.</i>

427
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,999
Too tight?

428
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,036
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

429
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,319
<i>Leave him alone.
He's a natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?</i>

430
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,079
Of course I am.

431
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,672
<i>A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what've you done?</i>

432
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,871
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?

433
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,799
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

434
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,349
<i>It's all right.
No, don't move it now.</i>

435
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,114
<i>People'll see the damage.
Why'd you do that?</i>

436
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,315
<i>I didn't see it.</i>

437
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,473
<i>It's a four-ton truck. It's not like
it's a packet of fucking peanuts.</i>

438
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,153
It was at a funny angle.

439
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,033
<i>It's behind you, Tyrone.</i>

440
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,589
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

441
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,435
Control that dog as well.

442
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,350
-Get that dog off him.
-Get it off me.

443
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,952
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

444
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,675
<i>Don't snatch.</i>

445
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,398
<i>He can't swallow the whole ball.</i>

446
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,275
Yeah.

447
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,633
Why the fuck...

448
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,115
...did you put Gorgeous George...

449
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,914
...into a bare-knuckle boxing match...

450
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,350
...two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

451
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,751
<i>He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.</i>

452
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,993
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

453
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,550
What the fuck did you expect?

454
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,030
A grease-down and a shiatsu?

455
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,589
Who took the jam out of your doughnut?

456
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,189
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut.

457
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,759
You did.

458
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,749
You said get a good deal.

459
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,434
I fail to recognize
the correlation...

460
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,638
...between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous...

461
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,108
...and a good deal.

462
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,477
<i>How'll we explain this to Brick Top?</i>

463
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,438
<i>That his fight won't happen?</i>

464
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,309
We replace the fighter.

465
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,312
<i>Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?</i>

466
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,357
Who the fuck will we
replace him with?

467
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,279
What about John The Gun?

468
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,879
Or Mad Fist Willy?

469
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,231
<i>You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you?</i>

470
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,392
Mad Fist went mad...

471
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,150
...and The Gun shot himself.

472
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,109
Jesus.

473
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,830
What?

474
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,957
<i>Let's use the fucking pikey.</i>

475
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,556
-How much you gonna pay us?
-10 K.

476
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,997
Me bollocks. Lose more
than that running for the bus.

477
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,949
All right.

478
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,037
<i>I'll do it for a caravan.</i>

479
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,790
A what?

480
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,155
A caravan.

481
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,836
-Top of the range and all that.
-It was us that wanted a caravan.

482
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,396
<i>Anyway, what's wrong with this one?</i>

483
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,631
<i>It's not for me.
It's for me ma.</i>

484
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,396
Your what?

485
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,709
His ma.

486
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,149
<i>Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.</i>

487
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,756
<i>They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.</i>

488
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,319
<i>Now I'm changing fighters...</i>

489
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,838
<i>...and Brick Top's gonna
exploit the situation.</i>

490
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,634
<i>He's gonna pull my pants down,
grease me up...</i>

491
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,030
<i>...and aim for penetration.</i>

492
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,390
<i>If I didn't have
the replacement pikey...</i>

493
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,835
<i>...he'd want to split me in half.</i>

494
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,670
They could charm the paint off walls,
these fellas.

495
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,550
<i>Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?</i>

496
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,515
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

497
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,228
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

498
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,912
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

499
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,878
<i>We've lost Gorgeous George.</i>

500
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,631
<i>You're gonna have to repeat that.</i>

501
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,590
<i>We've lost Gorgeous George.</i>

502
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,957
<i>Well, where'd you lose him?</i>

503
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,629
<i>He ain't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?</i>

504
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,434
<i>And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, is it?</i>

505
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,590
<i>We're not backing out.</i>

506
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,638
<i>You bet your bollocks to
a barn dance you're not.</i>

507
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,233
<i>We're changing the fighter.</i>

508
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,874
Oh, fuck me,
your lady friend got a voice?

509
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,190
Who are you changing him to,
sweetheart?

510
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,675
<i>You won't know him, but he's mustard.</i>

511
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,909
Mustard?

512
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,709
<i>I don't care if he's
Muhammad '' I'm Hard'' Bruce Lee...</i>

513
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,319
<i>...you can't change fighters.</i>

514
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,630
<i>-You've still got your fight.
-No.</i>

515
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,952
<i>I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters.</i>

516
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,829
<i>So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?</i>

517
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,718
You can take bets at the fight.

518
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,469
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

519
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,915
Do you want to get bitten, sweetheart?

520
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,635
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth.

521
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,078
<i>You understand me now,
don't you, Turkish?</i>

522
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,790
<i>This is the one place
I didn't want to be:</i>

523
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,234
<i>In his debt.</i>

524
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,949
<i>Which now means I'm in his pocket.</i>

525
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,873
<i>You're on thin-fucking-ice,
my pedigree chums.</i>

526
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,675
And I shall be under it
when it breaks.

527
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,069
Now, fuck off.

528
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,119
<i>Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?</i>

529
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,437
<i>I don't know. I'm not his mother.
But I'm seeing him later.</i>

530
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,148
-When later?
-He said he wanted cash.

531
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,273
<i>So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.</i>

532
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,919
A fight?

533
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,273
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?

534
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,998
<i>-Is there gambling involved?
-It's a boxing match, Avi.</i>

535
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,629
-Did he have a case with him?
-Yes, he had a case.

536
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,518
And this schmuck is gambling?

537
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,191
<i>You're talking about Franky '' I've got
a problem with gambling'' Four Fingers.</i>

538
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,953
<i>Avi, I'm not telepathic.</i>

539
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,191
<i>You're plenty stupid,
I'll give you that.</i>

540
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,948
Do you know why they call him
Franky Four Fingers?

541
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,474
I have no idea.

542
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,712
Because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

543
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,514
<i>When he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop.</i>

544
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,631
<i>And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin.</i>

545
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,233
<i>I'm sure he can pay.</i>

546
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,035
<i>Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush?
We're going to London.</i>

547
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,515
<i>Do you hear that?
I'm coming to London!</i>

548
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,992
-Avi!
-Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!

549
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,630
<i>I don't like leaving my own country...</i>

550
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,839
...especially leaving it for anything
less than warm, sandy beaches...

551
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,514
...and cocktails
with little straw hats.

552
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,952
<i>We've got sandy beaches.</i>

553
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,952
So who the fuck wants to see them?

554
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,909
I hope you can appreciate the concern
I have for my friend Franky.

555
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,390
<i>I'll find him,
and you'll help me find him.</i>

556
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,477
<i>And we'll start at that fight.</i>

557
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,392
How am I gonna get it out?

558
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,279
It will probably cough it up.

559
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,714
Will he be all right?

560
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,189
I hope not.

561
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,432
-Are we gonna rob this bookies?
-Yes, big man.

562
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,669
Why are we waiting?

563
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,509
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

564
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,510
<i>And why's that?</i>

565
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,436
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

566
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,079
<i>What's in the case?</i>

567
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,393
<i>For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.</i>

568
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,035
Jesus.

569
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,397
<i>-Private night tonight, chaps.
-I'm well aware of that, my son.</i>

570
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,278
<i>That's why we're here.</i>

571
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,111
Well done. This is the back way in.

572
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,278
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

573
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,157
<i>-Private night tonight, chaps.
-We know. That's why we're here.</i>

574
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,869
Tickets.

575
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,390
Are we ever gonna get into this place?

576
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,399
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.

577
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,353
<i>This ain't exactly Vegas,
and this ain't exactly legal.</i>

578
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,319
<i>I'm not looking for Vegas
or for legal.</i>

579
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,272
<i>I'm looking for Franky.</i>

580
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,916
<i>I know that,
and he said he's gonna be here.</i>

581
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,794
<i>-lf there's gambling, he'll be here.
-Let's not have a fuck-up.</i>

582
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,314
<i>You won't let us down.</i>

583
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,309
<i>He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that.</i>

584
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,915
Is that him?

585
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,230
<i>I don't know.
How many fingers did he have?</i>

586
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,436
<i>Sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.</i>

587
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,319
<i>Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's start the show.</i>

588
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,518
Do you know who
this bookies belongs to?

589
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,638
<i>If you know what's good for you
you'll give me everything--</i>

590
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,359
What are you doing?

591
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,875
<i>What does it look like
I'm doing up here?</i>

592
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,719
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.

593
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,150
Drop the screen now.

594
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,275
How you doing, Vince?

595
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,795
<i>I'd do a lot better
if you'd stop using my name.</i>

596
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,996
-Fill that bag.
-All bets are off.

597
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,836
I am not in here
to make a fucking bet.

598
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,195
Appreciated...

599
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,237
...but all bets...

600
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,039
...are...

601
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,389
...off.

602
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,877
<i>If all bets are off, then there
can't be any money, can there?</i>

603
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,316
<i>I ain't fucking buying that.</i>

604
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,876
<i>That's handy because I ain't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.</i>

605
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,199
What have you got?

606
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,399
Nothing, really.

607
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,833
A few coins, but no notes.

608
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,510
Show me your hands.

609
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,189
<i>You've got five fingers.</i>

610
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,395
Copper coins.

611
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,079
What do you mean,
copper-fucking-coins?

612
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,149
<i>It won't open
because it's a security door.</i>

613
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,469
Hold that.

614
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,519
My leg.

615
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,709
<i>What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.</i>

616
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,232
<i>We're fucked.</i>

617
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,230
What the fuck are you two doing?

618
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,555
Get us out of here.

619
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,828
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

620
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,834
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

621
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,237
<i>He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.</i>

622
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,793
In the red corner...

623
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,435
...we have the young
and unchallenged....

624
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,753
<i>So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?</i>

625
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,598
<i>Just make sure he doesn't kill me.</i>

626
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,516
So give it up
for the bone-crunching...

627
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,796
...one-punch machine gun...

628
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,832
...Mickey!

629
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,790
And in the other corner....

630
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,071
Now, I know he looks
like a fat fucker--

631
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,113
<i>Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.</i>

632
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,990
<i>Bomber ''The Mad Man'' Harris!</i>

633
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,591
Now, try and look like a fighter.

634
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,195
<i>Let's get ready...</i>

635
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,431
...to rumble!

636
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,116
<i>Do you realize I'm
fucking forty grand down?</i>

637
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,515
<i>What's the fucking crack?</i>

638
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,320
<i>-I'll make it up to you.
-I ain't happy.</i>

639
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,831
<i>I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.</i>

640
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,992
<i>Oh, that fucking pikey's
put me in it.</i>

641
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,756
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

642
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,958
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone...

643
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,553
<i>...I don't want to know
if it tastes good.</i>

644
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,590
<i>Stop me again whilst I'm walking and
I'll cut your fucking jacobs off.</i>

645
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,313
<i>-He's here.
-Well, you explain it to him.</i>

646
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,880
-What you doing?
-The case was attached to his arm.

647
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,390
<i>So why didn't you chop it off?</i>

648
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,796
<i>We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.</i>

649
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,308
But he has the case.

650
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,074
Look, we--
Well, you have a problem.

651
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,429
<i>There weren't much cash
at the bookies.</i>

652
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,475
Okay.

653
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,273
Here is the 10 grand.

654
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,313
No. Keep it. We want this.

655
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,109
Well, at least half of this.

656
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,074
What was in the case was mine.

657
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,471
What was in the bookies was yours.
Okay?

658
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,389
<i>It wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.</i>

659
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,318
<i>No, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.</i>

660
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,916
<i>We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.</i>

661
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,079
We could, by all rights, keep
the whole fucking stone, Boris.

662
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,634
Watch out!

663
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,632
Drop the gun, fat boy.

664
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,830
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

665
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,552
Give me the stone.

666
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,955
<i>-It's in the case.
-What?</i>

667
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,276
<i>It's in the case.</i>

668
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,033
You put the stone in the case?

669
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,953
Open it and give me the stone.

670
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,874
The only man who knew
the combination, you just shot.

671
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,035
<i>Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.</i>

672
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,035
<i>Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.</i>

673
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,716
<i>I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.</i>

674
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,433
<i>I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.</i>

675
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,309
<i>But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.</i>

676
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,198
<i>Once I have that, it's--</i>

677
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,469
Oink, oink.

678
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,275
Shit.

679
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,198
<i>So that's where you keep the sugar.</i>

680
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,793
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

681
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,112
<i>That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it?</i>

682
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,590
<i>And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?</i>

683
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,708
<i>No, we don't, John.</i>

684
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,191
I just had them polished.

685
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,557
Go and put the kettle on.

686
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,156
-You take sugar?
-No, thank you, Turkish.

687
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,678
<i>I'm sweet enough.</i>

688
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,031
<i>He's now your problem.</i>

689
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,629
Okay?

690
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,193
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body...

691
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,432
...but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers....

692
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,919
Well, look at him.

693
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,877
<i>I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.</i>

694
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,235
I want to use the pikey.

695
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,034
All right. Of course.

696
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,436
Of course, fucking of course.

697
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,029
<i>I wasn't asking, I was telling.</i>

698
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,115
But this time...

699
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,549
...I do want him to go down
in the fourth.

700
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,359
And I do mean it, this time.

701
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,597
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

702
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,791
So now you can open it.

703
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,390
Turkish has been a busy
little bastard.

704
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,312
<i>I think he's got away with enough.</i>

705
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,434
<i>Thinking can get you into trouble,
Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.</i>

706
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,517
That takes care of one little piggy.

707
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,479
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

708
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,909
Find them today.

709
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,515
<i>Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.</i>

710
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,355
Tommy.

711
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,717
<i>You're a snake in the grass,
ain't you? Where'd they come from?</i>

712
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,110
<i>You're looking for my boy, are you?</i>

713
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,715
-Do you know where I can find him?
-Yeah.

714
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,797
Would you like
to share that information?

715
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,349
<i>I don't want you getting
my boy into trouble.</i>

716
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,677
<i>He's my only boy.
And he's a good boy.</i>

717
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,508
<i>He's coursing.</i>

718
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,199
<i>What's coursing?</i>

719
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,596
Hare coursing.

720
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,194
<i>They set two lurchers--
They're dogs, before you ask.</i>

721
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,553
On a hare.

722
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,112
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

723
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,316
<i>So, what if it doesn't?</i>

724
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,910
<i>Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?</i>

725
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,918
Proper fucked?

726
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,874
Yeah, Tommy.

727
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,396
<i>Before ''zee'' Germans get there.</i>

728
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,712
Do you know these tits, Errol?

729
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,034
I know a lot of tits...

730
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,634
<i>...but I don't know any
as fucking stupid as these two.</i>

731
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,835
John?

732
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,679
<i>I can't help, guv.</i>

733
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,588
Tyrone.

734
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,559
You silly, fat bastard.

735
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,718
-Do you want to do it?
-That depends.

736
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,870
On what?

737
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,873
On you buying this caravan.

738
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,395
Not the rouge one. The rose.

739
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,036
<i>-It's not the same caravan.
-Not the same fight.</i>

740
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,157
<i>It's twice the size of the last one.</i>

741
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,233
The fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.

742
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,313
<i>I like to look after me ma.
It's a fair deal. Take it.</i>

743
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,314
<i>You're lucky we aren't worm food
after your last performance.</i>

744
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,752
<i>Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.</i>

745
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,398
<i>I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant....</i>

746
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,836
Save your breath for cooling
your porridge.

747
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,479
<i>Right. And she's terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue.</i>

748
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,993
Have I made myself clear?

749
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,275
<i>Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.</i>

750
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,672
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

751
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,276
Did you understand a word
of what he said?

752
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,149
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

753
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,949
Fucker.

754
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,953
<i>I'll bet you for it.</i>

755
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,475
<i>You'll what?</i>

756
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,948
<i>He'll bet you for it.</i>

757
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,313
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favour?

758
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,959
<i>I'll do you a favour.</i>

759
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,760
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan...

760
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,991
...and the boys get
a pair of them shoes.

761
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,712
If I lose...

762
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,718
<i>...fuck it, I'll do the fight
for free.</i>

763
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,313
<i>The last thing I really
want to do is bet a pikey.</i>

764
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,596
<i>However, I don't really
have much of a choice.</i>

765
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,312
<i>Somehow I've got to get him to fight,
but if I lose....</i>

766
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,518
<i>Well, I don't even want
to think about losing.</i>

767
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,590
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.

768
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,717
What? Proper fucked?

769
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,512
You got that, London?

770
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,715
<i>We're on!</i>

771
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,719
<i>I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.</i>

772
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,998
<i>I'll tell you
who robbed your bookies.</i>

773
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,920
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.

774
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,115
<i>Who's proper fucked now, then?</i>

775
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,796
<i>There's something very wrong
with this.</i>

776
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,152
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

777
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,317
<i>Well, why didn't you '' bust a cap
in his ass'' then, Tommy?</i>

778
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,877
<i>Mind you, you'd do more damage
if you threw it at him.</i>

779
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,509
<i>What? You saying I can't shoot?</i>

780
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,150
<i>Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn't saying you can't shoot.</i>

781
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,158
<i>I know you can't shoot.</i>

782
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,558
<i>What we're saying is, that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers...</i>

783
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,671
...would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

784
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,353
<i>You saying the gun don't work?</i>

785
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,868
You tried it?

786
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,916
Whoops.

787
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,232
I want to see
that sneaky fucking Russian.

788
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,035
<i>Why's he got a tea cosy on his head?</i>

789
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,117
To keep his head warm.

790
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,715
-What happened to him?
-He got shot in the face.

791
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,313
I thought that was obvious.

792
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,790
<i>What'd you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?</i>

793
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,395
-What do you want me to do?
-Sort it out.

794
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,359
<i>-I'm not a witch doctor.
-But you are a bad boy yardie...</i>

795
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,319
...and bad boy yardies should know how
to get rid of bodies.

796
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,199
<i>I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.</i>

797
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,954
<i>We're in, governor.</i>

798
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,638
Goody gumdrops.

799
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,155
Get us a cup of tea,
would you, Errol?

800
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,915
Grab hold of his legs.

801
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,913
<i>What do you think
I'm gonna grab him by, his ears?</i>

802
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,474
Hope this is not a bad moment.

803
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,428
Do you know who I am?

804
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,114
I do.

805
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,832
Good. That will save me
some time, then.

806
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,913
<i>Well, I don't.</i>

807
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,638
<i>You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.</i>

808
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,951
Apparently, the best thing to do...

809
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,677
...is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

810
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,028
Would someone mind telling me,
who are you?

811
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,078
When you got your six pieces,
you gotta get rid of them.

812
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,630
<i>It's no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover.</i>

813
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,630
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

814
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,151
You gotta starve the pigs
for a few days...

815
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,472
...then the chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

816
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,316
You gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out...

817
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,278
<i>...for the piggies' digestion.</i>

818
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,471
You could do this afterwards,
of course...

819
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,029
<i>...but you don't want
to sieve through pigshit, do you?</i>

820
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,715
They will go through bone like butter.

821
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,829
You need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting...

822
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,908
...so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

823
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,232
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds...

824
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,317
...in about eight minutes.

825
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,073
That means that a single pig...

826
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,875
...can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh...

827
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,037
...every minute.

828
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,517
Hence the expression...

829
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,911
<i>...''as greedy as a pig.''</i>

830
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,718
<i>Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.</i>

831
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,997
<i>Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me
who the fuck you are...</i>

832
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,993
...apart from someone who feeds people
to pigs, of course.

833
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,911
<i>Do you know what '' nemesis'' means?</i>

834
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,430
<i>''A righteous infliction
of retribution...</i>

835
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,395
<i>...manifested by an
appropriate agent.''</i>

836
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,595
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

837
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,433
Me.

838
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,234
Gentlemen....

839
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,348
<i>Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?</i>

840
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,958
<i>Avi, what do you want me to do?
I'm not a bounty hunter.</i>

841
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,749
What about Tony?

842
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,115
<i>Bullet-Tooth Tony.</i>

843
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,196
<i>Who's Bullet-Tooth--</i>

844
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,351
-Tony!
-You silly fuck.

845
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,589
<i>He's a liability.</i>

846
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,910
<i>He'd find Moses and the burning bush.</i>

847
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,513
You are gonna die, Tony!

848
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,832
He got shot six times,
had the bullets moulded into gold.

849
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,352
I shoot you, you go down!

850
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,279
He has two in his teeth
that Dad did, so he loves Dad.

851
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,117
<i>Why don't you fucking die?</i>

852
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,874
<i>-He's the best chance you got.
-Six times?</i>

853
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,719
In one sitting.

854
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,118
<i>You're in trouble now.</i>

855
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,836
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

856
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,995
<i>Bonjour.</i>

857
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,515
<i>What's so fucking important?</i>

858
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,830
<i>Why do you think
we've got a dead man...</i>

859
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,753
-...missing an arm in our office?
-Talk to me, tell me.

860
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,718
You give us four days...

861
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,470
<i>...l'll get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.</i>

862
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,869
What do you think, Errol?

863
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,197
I think we should drip-dry them,
while we got the chance.

864
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,556
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

865
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,308
What have I told you about thinking?

866
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,990
-You got 48 hours.
-Yeah.

867
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,391
<i>You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can't lift him.</i>

868
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,789
Forty-eight hours.

869
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,433
<i>After that it's your family...</i>

870
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,393
<i>...and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.</i>

871
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,519
<i>So, what should I call you?
Should I call you '' Bullet''? ''Tooth''?</i>

872
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,318
<i>Call me ''Susan''
if it makes you happy.</i>

873
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,836
<i>Tony, there is a man
I'd like you to find.</i>

874
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,595
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

875
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,636
Forty thousand.

876
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,158
Where was he last seen?

877
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:00,910
At a bookies.

878
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,754
Bookies?

879
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,757
Pass us the blower, Susi.

880
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,598
-Bookies got blagged last night.
-Blagged? Speak English.

881
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:18,356
This country spawned the language,
and nobody seems to speak it.

882
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,914
Blagged, robbed.

883
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,390
<i>We'll see a man
that may know something.</i>

884
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,312
I need a gun.

885
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,512
<i>You don't, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.</i>

886
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,190
I got fucking black ink all
over fuck boy.

887
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,436
<i>He's stained for fucking life.</i>

888
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,280
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell--

889
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,794
All right, Mullet?

890
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,232
How you doing?
You all right, mate?

891
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,314
Nice tie.

892
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,118
<i>I heard you weren't about that much.</i>

893
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,432
Still warm, the blood
that courses through my veins.

894
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,752
Unlike yours, Mullet.

895
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,033
<i>Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?</i>

896
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,392
-Do me a favour, Tone.
-I will do you a favour, Mullet.

897
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,235
<i>I'll not bash the fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends.</i>

898
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,510
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.

899
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,113
Comfortable, Mullet?

900
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,318
<i>It's sadly ironic it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.</i>

901
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,233
Now, you take all
the time you want, mate.

902
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,432
What the fuck you doing, Tone?

903
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,148
Driving down the street
with your head in my window.

904
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,236
<i>-What you think I'm doing?
-Well, don't, Tone.</i>

905
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,191
You been using dog shit
for toothpaste?

906
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,634
Slow down, Tone.

907
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,876
Slow down, Tony!

908
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,554
<i>I don't think so.
I think I'll speed up.</i>

909
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,911
Play some music if you like.

910
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,068
I love this track.

911
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,788
<i>I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.</i>

912
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,429
Yes, Mullet?

913
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,880
<i>I think it's two black guys that work
from a pawn shop in Smith Street.</i>

914
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,832
Better not be telling me porky pies.

915
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:03,234
<i>I tell you, it's two black guys work
out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.</i>

916
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,756
<i>It's very effective, Tony.</i>

917
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,951
<i>It's not too subtle, but effective.</i>

918
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,913
Are we taking him with us?

919
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,869
<i>It's the Russian.</i>

920
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,915
A Russian?

921
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,674
<i>To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.</i>

922
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,272
<i>Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.</i>

923
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,673
-Give me a name.
-Yurinov.

924
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,234
Boris.

925
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,239
-Boris The Blade?
-Yeah.

926
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,239
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?

927
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,995
Why do they call him
The Bullet-Dodger?

928
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,235
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.

929
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,918
<i>He won't fight unless
we buy his mum a caravan...</i>

930
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,513
<i>...and you nicked all our savings.</i>

931
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,034
In the quiet words
of the Virgin Mary, come again?

932
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,629
<i>He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.</i>

933
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,110
<i>-Are you taking the piss?
-What can I do?</i>

934
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,430
<i>I can't make him do it, can I?</i>

935
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,672
<i>You're not much good to me alive
are you, Turkish?</i>

936
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,348
<i>He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.</i>

937
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,756
I want that pikey to fight.

938
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,352
<i>Brick Top thought smashing up
our arcade...</i>

939
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,518
<i>...might help me
to persuade Mickey to fight.</i>

940
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,557
<i>And if that wasn't enough...</i>

941
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,155
<i>...he thought it would be
a good idea...</i>

942
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,035
<i>... to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.</i>

943
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,113
<i>While she was asleep in it.</i>

944
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,951
Turkish, get your arse up.

945
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,470
You lot...

946
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,549
<i>...follow me
and I'll fucking shoot you.</i>

947
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,313
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.

948
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,354
<i>I've got the gun, son.
I think it's you who should behave.</i>

949
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,949
What?

950
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,955
<i>You want to see
if I've got the minerals?</i>

951
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,234
Jesus.

952
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,879
Sorry, Mickey.

953
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,474
Did you do it?

954
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,879
Then what are you sorry for?

955
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,355
-What are you two doing here?
-Come back!

956
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,319
-You got some tars on you.
-Fuck off, Darren.

957
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,514
Fuck off!

958
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,317
<i>How silly do I feel?</i>

959
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,314
<i>His mum is still smoking
next to us...</i>

960
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,516
<i>...and I'm asking him to fight.</i>

961
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,354
<i>I'll do the fight before he causes
any more carnage.</i>

962
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,678
<i>And if he'd said no...</i>

963
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,235
<i>... it could've been
a shite sight worse.</i>

964
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,439
Russians.

965
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,999
Russians.

966
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,633
<i>I should've known.</i>

967
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,634
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.

968
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,836
What do you know about this goyim?

969
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,998
Ex-KGB cancer.

970
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,796
He was a highly trained
undercover agent.

971
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,315
<i>He'll be impossible to track down.</i>

972
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,155
Yeah.

973
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,870
<i>There's a strange man who wants
to sell us an 84-carat stone.</i>

974
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,554
<i>-Where's he from?
-I don't know. Hard to tell.</i>

975
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,028
<i>He's got a thick Russian accent.</i>

976
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:13,312
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

977
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,356
<i>That sneaky fucking Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.</i>

978
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,955
First things first. One of us...

979
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:25,156
<i>...Tyrone, you go to the Russian's.
The second you see him, call us.</i>

980
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,749
Now.

981
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,511
<i>He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.</i>

982
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,752
<i>I hate Russians.
I'll take care of him.</i>

983
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,592
All yours, Rosebud, old son.

984
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,272
Not a problem.

985
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,632
Get me to a doctor.

986
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,553
Shoot that fuck!
Then, get me to a doctor.

987
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,637
Okay, but first we get the stone.

988
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,916
First the stone. Then a doctor.

989
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,913
<i>And not just any doctor, boychik.
A nice Jewish doctor.</i>

990
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,151
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!

991
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,634
Get his keys
and find out where the stone is.

992
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,118
-I think you got something to tell us.
-Take it easy, Rosebud.

993
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,510
Do you want him to be able
to talk or not?

994
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,035
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?

995
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,716
<i>They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is gonna argue.</i>

996
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,520
<i>I've got extra loud blanks,
just in case.</i>

997
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,233
In case we have
to deafen them to death?

998
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,675
-Yeah.
-Boris is here.

999
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,878
<i>-We're coming over. Hold him there.
-Hold on!</i>

1000
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,109
<i>He's not on his own!</i>

1001
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,309
<i>We're off.</i>

1002
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,115
Very industrious for a Cossack.

1003
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,748
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1004
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,275
So, where is he?

1005
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,034
<i>It's not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.</i>

1006
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,158
<i>-They locked Boris in the car.
-Why didn't you tell us that?</i>

1007
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:14,789
Did they look hard?

1008
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,195
They looked messy.

1009
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,159
<i>-Let's get out of here.
-What about the Russian?</i>

1010
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,112
I want you to bury him.

1011
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,675
All right.

1012
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,436
I think we should get you a new gun.

1013
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,517
But this time, try it.

1014
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,631
<i>How far to the Russian's?</i>

1015
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,359
Be there in a minute.

1016
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,430
-Come on, then.
-No, no, not so fast, Vinny.

1017
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,478
<i>We can't take them now.
We're gonna have to follow them.</i>

1018
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,435
<i>You shouldn't drink
that stuff, anyway.</i>

1019
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,199
<i>Why? What's wrong with it?</i>

1020
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,238
<i>-It's not in sync with evolution.
-Shut up.</i>

1021
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,799
How do we get rid of him?

1022
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,349
<i>-Do you want to shoot him?
-It's a little noisy.</i>

1023
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,353
<i>-Do you want to stab him?
-That's a little cold-blooded.</i>

1024
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,990
<i>-Do you want to kill him or not?
-I'll cut him. I got a blade.</i>

1025
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,559
<i>That's the spirit.</i>

1026
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,199
Do they fire?

1027
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,595
Of course they fire.

1028
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,876
<i>But how do you know?
They're replicas.</i>

1029
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,997
What do you know about replicas?

1030
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,077
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

1031
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,390
You wanted to know
whether they worked.

1032
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:25,236
<i>I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!</i>

1033
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,909
What are you gonna do with that,
pick his teeth?

1034
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,675
<i>Wipe the butter off and put it away.
There's a proper blade back there.</i>

1035
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,151
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8000 years.

1036
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,755
Before, they were running
around mad as lorries.

1037
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,879
<i>The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.</i>

1038
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,879
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1039
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,951
Let me do you a favour.

1040
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,835
Whoops.

1041
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,433
You. Want a knife?

1042
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,716
<i>No, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do.</i>

1043
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,030
<i>It's a knife, for God's sake.</i>

1044
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,475
<i>What's kept your fork company
all these years?</i>

1045
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,877
The sharp side, the blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1046
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,349
Is that Boris?

1047
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,120
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1048
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,799
What about Rosebud?

1049
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,759
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

1050
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,479
But which bit would you like?

1051
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:00,795
<i>They're getting out.</i>

1052
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,916
Get down and follow them.

1053
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,077
Cover yourself up, Avi.

1054
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,594
<i>You're making a scene.</i>

1055
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,314
<i>I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.</i>

1056
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,679
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1057
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,313
<i>I can't leave him in here, can I?</i>

1058
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,997
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1059
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:29,348
<i>I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.</i>

1060
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:33,150
<i>-He's left the door open.
-Shouldn't think that's a good idea.</i>

1061
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,719
Should we go in?

1062
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,270
<i>I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.</i>

1063
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,394
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1064
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,956
<i>He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.</i>

1065
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,953
<i>I don't care if
he's got fucking hazelnuts.</i>

1066
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:52,755
<i>I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.</i>

1067
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,875
My God, Tommy, you certainly
got those minerals.

1068
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,675
<i>Well, come on, then
before ''zee'' Germans get here.</i>

1069
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,036
<i>You just tell him who's in charge.</i>

1070
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,949
Boris--

1071
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,235
You certainly told him.

1072
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,877
The Drowning Trout.

1073
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,199
Come and pick us up.

1074
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,469
And Doug...

1075
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,079
...sharpish.

1076
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,239
<i>I don't want a fuss or to put
a bullet in your face...</i>

1077
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,910
...but unless you give me what
I want there will be fucking murders.

1078
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,550
<i>What's your name?</i>

1079
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,350
Shoot him.

1080
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,915
Let go of the gun!

1081
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,831
<i>So, you're obviously the big dick...</i>

1082
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,313
...and that, on either side of you,
are your balls.

1083
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,316
There are two types of balls:

1084
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,794
There are big brave balls,
and there are little faggot balls.

1085
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,429
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1086
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,116
Dicks have drive
and clarity of vision...

1087
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,799
<i>...but they're not clever.</i>

1088
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,238
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1089
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,232
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy...

1090
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,597
...and have brought your
two little faggot balls along...

1091
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,156
<i>...for a good old time. But
you've got your parties muddled up.</i>

1092
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,319
<i>There's no pussy here...</i>

1093
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,630
<i>...just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.</i>

1094
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,912
Like a prick...

1095
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,399
<i>...you're having second thoughts.</i>

1096
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,118
<i>You're shrinking.</i>

1097
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,560
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1098
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,195
<i>The fact that you've got '' Replica''
written on the side of your gun...</i>

1099
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,232
<i>...and the fact that
I've got '' Desert Eagle .50'' ...</i>

1100
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,558
...written on the side of mine...

1101
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,957
...should precipitate...

1102
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,755
...your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1103
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,955
Now...

1104
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,959
...fuck off.

1105
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,199
Lock the door.

1106
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,674
Lock it!

1107
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,554
Give me the case.

1108
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,839
Fuck you.

1109
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,755
Shoot me.

1110
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,076
<i>I will. I'll shoot you.</i>

1111
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,599
Pass me case or I shoot you.

1112
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,033
You know what?

1113
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,275
Fuck you too.

1114
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,031
<i>Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be doing
me a favour, you Russian fuck.</i>

1115
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,874
You! Drop guns.

1116
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,310
Fuck you!

1117
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,472
You drop your gun!

1118
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,949
Okay.

1119
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,875
Avi...

1120
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,235
...pull your socks up!

1121
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,390
<i>-Tyrone?
-Fuck it. We're out of here.</i>

1122
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,999
Give me case.

1123
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,349
Avi...

1124
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,396
<i>-...where's the case?
-Put the gun away.</i>

1125
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,512
<i>What's Boris doing here?</i>

1126
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,557
Boris, what are you doing here?

1127
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,677
Fuck you!

1128
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,273
<i>Where's the case?</i>

1129
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,148
<i>-You piece of crap.
-Don't take the piss, Boris.</i>

1130
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,470
<i>I'll show you.</i>

1131
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,393
Fuck you!

1132
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,191
Almost had it.

1133
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,198
<i>For fuck's sake.</i>

1134
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,117
Fuck you and all.

1135
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,314
You lucky bastard.

1136
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,229
<i>Jeez, it's flawless.</i>

1137
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,553
<i>Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.</i>

1138
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,108
Leave the dog here.

1139
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:33,797
<i>-Sol, why don't we just leave?
-Because life's too short, Vincent...</i>

1140
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,759
<i>...and it'll get a lot shorter
if Brick Top wishes.</i>

1141
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,271
<i>-Now leave that dog here.
-I'm gonna leave the dog here.</i>

1142
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,270
<i>Don't worry about it!</i>

1143
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,149
<i>And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.</i>

1144
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:47,676
<i>It's okay.</i>

1145
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,352
Sit down. Down.

1146
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,998
<i>I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.</i>

1147
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,390
<i>Well, we won't if you don't.</i>

1148
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,111
All right, you give me the stone...

1149
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,109
...and I will give it
to Brick Top. Yeah?

1150
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,279
<i>All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.</i>

1151
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,075
Why is it down there?

1152
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,953
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1153
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,918
<i>You ain't from this planet, are you?</i>

1154
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,955
Who is gonna mug two black fellas
holding pistols...

1155
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,749
<i>...sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?</i>

1156
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,074
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle .50.

1157
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,715
What have they got to do
with anything?

1158
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,070
<i>They're both staring straight at me.</i>

1159
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:48,153
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1160
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,509
Now, out of the car.

1161
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,996
And leave your water pistols behind.

1162
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,395
<i>Look, just tell him the stone's back
at the office.</i>

1163
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,159
<i>I'll think of something.</i>

1164
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,630
<i>Why's he sweating?</i>

1165
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,909
Oh, never mind.

1166
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,589
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1167
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,879
<i>-I'm a little worried, actually.
-Worried about what?</i>

1168
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,115
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1169
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,197
<i>I mean, he's done it before,
hasn't he?</i>

1170
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,268
We get murdered before we leave the
building, and we get fed to the pigs.

1171
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:28,915
<i>I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.</i>

1172
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,519
<i>Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.</i>

1173
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,870
<i>Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one.</i>

1174
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,635
<i>It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.</i>

1175
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,033
<i>You know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake.</i>

1176
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:49,590
<i>I'm not worried about whether Mickey
knocks the other man out.</i>

1177
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,752
<i>I'm worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round.</i>

1178
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,514
<i>What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?</i>

1179
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,990
We get murdered before leaving
the building...

1180
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,312
...and I imagine we get fed
to the pigs.

1181
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,277
So why are you so calm?

1182
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,390
-I said--
-I heard what you said, Tommy!

1183
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,674
<i>It's not as though we've got a choice,
now, is it?</i>

1184
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,832
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy...

1185
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:19,398
<i>...and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.</i>

1186
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,988
<i>Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.</i>

1187
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,833
Oh, that fucking dog!

1188
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,719
Go on, get the dog.

1189
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,717
<i>-It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
-Open a window.</i>

1190
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,716
You people live like animals.

1191
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,832
<i>Now, where's the stone?</i>

1192
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,190
<i>-Come on, where is it?
-It's over here.</i>

1193
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,398
-Where? Where?
-I left it in a box.

1194
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,396
<i>It's empty.</i>

1195
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,598
<i>I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.</i>

1196
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,511
<i>No, I'm being serious!</i>

1197
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,115
The dog. The dog must have had it.

1198
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,996
<i>Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.</i>

1199
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,788
-What?
-Look in the dog.

1200
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,953
<i>-You mean, '' look in the dog''?
-I mean, open him up.</i>

1201
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,317
<i>It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?</i>

1202
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,471
You know what I mean.

1203
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:09,915
<i>That's a bit strong.</i>

1204
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,829
<i>I don't know about this.</i>

1205
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,952
<i>No, you can't do this.</i>

1206
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,879
<i>It's fucking squeaking!</i>

1207
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:24,033
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!

1208
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,152
<i>I'm shooting the dog!</i>

1209
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,638
Shoot the fucking dog!

1210
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,634
You sneaky fucking bastard.

1211
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,115
Thank God for that.

1212
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,351
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

1213
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,792
Tony, come on!

1214
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,994
Tony?

1215
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,359
<i>-Anything to declare?
-Yeah. Don't go to England.</i>

1216
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,635
That dog is gonna go back
to the campsite. It always does.

1217
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,876
<i>How's the dog gonna find the campsite?</i>

1218
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,276
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1219
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,358
All right. But we have
to wait until it gets light.

1220
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,431
And we have to get rid
of these bodies.

1221
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,831
<i>That one with the tea cosy
on his head's starting to stink.</i>

1222
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:08,989
<i>Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.</i>

1223
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,354
Mickey.

1224
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,429
Mickey!

1225
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,752
You feeling all right, Mickey?

1226
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,589
Need a drink.

1227
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,559
<i>You can't give him a drink!</i>

1228
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,717
<i>It's not for him. It's for me.</i>

1229
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,031
Ah, mates. Amen.

1230
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:48,998
<i>He's a hard bastard, this Good Night
Anderson, so pay attention.</i>

1231
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,279
All right, Mickey?

1232
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,274
Mickey!

1233
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,278
Need to have a shite!

1234
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:04,951
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me...

1235
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,191
...shoot the bastards.

1236
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,788
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.

1237
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,919
All right, Tom.

1238
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:24,799
-Hope we get a better show this time.
-This will make up for it.

1239
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,235
<i>Mickey's going down in the fourth.</i>

1240
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,869
Terry over there is in charge
of the bets.

1241
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,718
Now, you have to forgive me.

1242
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,468
<i>I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.</i>

1243
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,433
<i>-Our lads at the campsite?
-They're over there now.</i>

1244
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,750
I fucking hate pikeys.

1245
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,559
-How long have we gotta stay here?
-As long as it takes. Now, shut up.

1246
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,477
Fucking hate pikeys.

1247
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,477
Is he fucking stoned?

1248
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,871
<i>He's like that before a fight.</i>

1249
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,390
<i>Do you know when you're going down?</i>

1250
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,074
<i>Of course he knows
when he's going down.</i>

1251
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:09,393
<i>Fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?</i>

1252
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:12,148
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

1253
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,675
<i>I'll remember that next time
I climb off your mum.</i>

1254
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:18,117
-Not now.
-Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

1255
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,073
Be a nice one.
Hell of a way to be a war.

1256
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,719
And there none a yours.

1257
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,709
<i>There's a camp full of pikeys
that might not think you're so funny.</i>

1258
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:31,111
<i>Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.</i>

1259
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,397
Now get up and have a fucking fight.

1260
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:43,510
<i>Three rounds and you're a vegetable,
aren't you, pikey!</i>

1261
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,872
<i>I'm in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye-gouging.</i>

1262
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,190
<i>Do your worst. Let's get it on!</i>

1263
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,073
<i>What the fuck's going on?
You gonna finish him or what?</i>

1264
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,198
Talk about saved by the bell.

1265
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:56,156
Do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out?

1266
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,590
<i>Do not knock him out, Mickey.</i>

1267
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,598
<i>All right, let's break it up.</i>

1268
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,593
What, is he fucking deaf?

1269
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,672
What is he doing?

1270
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,074
Come on and sit.

1271
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,677
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?

1272
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,911
<i>You're dancing like a fairy.</i>

1273
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,714
<i>They'll hang us
if they think it's rigged.</i>

1274
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,516
Get out there and hurt him.

1275
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:18,556
<i>But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.</i>

1276
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,353
<i>All he's got to do is stay down.</i>

1277
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,830
<i>Now, we are fucked.</i>

1278
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:53,710
<i>He can't stand up.</i>

1279
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:54,676
<i>We're out of here.</i>

1280
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,829
<i>Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got
keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns...</i>

1281
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,435
<i>...sitting outside his campsite.</i>

1282
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:07,436
<i>Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's gonna be the same for us.</i>

1283
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,752
<i>Ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?</i>

1284
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,399
Give me that fucking shooter!

1285
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:16,194
<i>And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.</i>

1286
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,549
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1287
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:20,151
<i>Something very silly.</i>

1288
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:23,273
<i>You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you...</i>

1289
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,909
<i>...because you're too scared
to think.</i>

1290
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:29,112
<i>You just freeze
and pull a stupid face.</i>

1291
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,516
<i>But the pikey didn't. Why?</i>

1292
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,433
<i>Because he had plans
on running the car over.</i>

1293
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,751
<i>It had previously occurred to me...</i>

1294
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:42,157
<i>... that he'd taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly.</i>

1295
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,834
<i>For every action,
there is a reaction.</i>

1296
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,917
<i>And a pikey reaction...</i>

1297
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,874
<i>... is quite a fucking thing.</i>

1298
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,156
Pete, talk to me.

1299
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:37,836
If you want your friend to hear you,
talk a lot louder than that.

1300
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:49,870
<i>-Give me that fucking shooter.
-I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.</i>

1301
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,070
<i>That is when I thought the pikey
had money riding on himself.</i>

1302
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:05,436
<i>That's why the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.</i>

1303
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,832
<i>We've been tucked up...</i>

1304
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:11,953
<i>... while he's been cleaning up.</i>

1305
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,508
<i>We're worse off now than
when we started.</i>

1306
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,109
<i>The next day we went
to the campsite...</i>

1307
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,392
<i>...but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night.</i>

1308
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,517
<i>Which was probably a good thing...</i>

1309
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:33,998
<i>... considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.</i>

1310
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,594
Where is he?

1311
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,871
<i>He ain't fucking here,
that's for sure.</i>

1312
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:42,036
<i>We can't ask a man to fight for us
if we can't find him, can we?</i>

1313
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,397
<i>You won't find a pikey that
doesn't want to be found.</i>

1314
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,592
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

1315
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,838
Bollocks! Come on.

1316
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:01,593
<i>-What you doing here?
-What's it got to do with you?</i>

1317
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,396
So, what you doing here?

1318
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:17,439
<i>I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?</i>

1319
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:19,910
<i>What's in the car?</i>

1320
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,033
Seats and a steering wheel.

1321
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:24,878
What do you know about gypsies?

1322
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,477
<i>I know they're not to be trusted.</i>

1323
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,040
All right, get your dog. On your way.

1324
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,313
Get the dog, Tommy.

1325
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,314
The dog.

1326
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:44,118
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

1327
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,432
He loves that dog.

1328
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,438
Always playing silly games.

1329
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:51,911
Stop messing about
and get it in the car. Tommy!

1330
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:58,271
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

1331
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,073
Could you tell me...

1332
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:13,432
...why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot?

1333
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:14,995
Hey, George...

1334
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,430
...is that a tea cosy on his head?

1335
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:24,029
<i>Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?</i>

1336
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:35,994
<i>Tommy persuaded me to keep the dog.</i>

1337
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:39,710
<i>I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.</i>

1338
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,315
<i>I couldn't stand
that squeaking anymore.</i>

1339
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:45,797
<i>The vet found half an undigested
shoe, a squeaky toy...</i>

1340
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:49,191
<i>...and an 84-carat diamond
lodged in its stomach.</i>

1341
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,189
<i>It's quite amazing what can happen
in a week.</i>

1342
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,477
<i>Still didn't shut it up, though.</i>

1343
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,112
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1344
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,153
<i>You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.</i>

1345
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,879
So, what do you think?

1346
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,670
<i>Do you know anyone
who'd be interested?</i>

1347
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,196
I might.

1348
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:27,195
