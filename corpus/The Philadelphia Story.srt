1
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:41,752
Tracy!

2
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:43,381
Tracy!

3
00:02:58,172 --> 00:02:59,298
Tracy!

4
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:01,740
- How do you spell "omelet"?
- Oh, you.

5
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:05,905
Ninety-four for the ceremony
and 506 for the reception.

6
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,039
I don't know where
we'll put them if it rains.

7
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:10,516
It won't rain.
Tracy won't stand for it.

8
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:14,817
- Mother, how do you spell "omelet"?
- O-M-M-E-L-E-T.

9
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:18,325
- I thought there was another "L."
- An omelet's a funny wedding present.

10
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:22,261
- It was a silver dish, dear.
- Bring some of that junk off the table.

11
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,764
Be an angel and get these
things out of the way.

12
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:26,823
Yes, darling.

13
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,872
This stinks.

14
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,809
Don't say "stinks," darling.

15
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:38,812
If absolutely necessary, "smells."

16
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,905
These cards have
been changed again.

17
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:44,975
There must be a ghost in the house,
the ghost of bridegroom number one.

18
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:47,419
Don't talk about Dexter
as though he were dead.

19
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:49,922
- He may as well be, for all Tracy cares.
- Right.

20
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,322
I wouldn't say that.

21
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:54,327
If I never see
Mr. C.K. Dexter Haven again, I'll be...

22
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:56,727
- Isn't that awful?
- They're friends of your father's.

23
00:03:56,798 --> 00:04:00,928
What are they, tap dancers
or just musical comedy producers?

24
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:03,732
That's hardly fair to your
father's interest in the art.

25
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:07,901
Art, my eye! The art of putting up
$100,000 to display the shapely legs...

26
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:10,705
- That will do, Tracy.
- I give up.

27
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:16,283
If you'd just face the facts
squarely, as I did...

28
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:20,811
We'd face the fact that neither of us
has proved to be a success as a wife.

29
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:24,324
We just picked the wrong
first husbands, that's all.

30
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:27,589
Don't let's argue about it.
You wanted me to take a stand, so I did.

31
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:30,995
It's the only stand a woman could take
and keep her self-respect.

32
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:32,828
Yes, dear, I know.

33
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,801
Now I have my self-respect
and no husband.

34
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,033
You almost talk as though
you wanted him back.

35
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:40,972
He wouldn't come back, probably.

36
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:44,443
Hey, it's better this way, really.
You'll see.

37
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:48,539
Let's forget about the past. We both
deserve some happiness, especially you.

38
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:50,379
- Darling.
- Isn't George an angel?

39
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:52,851
- George is an angel.
- Is he handsome or is he not?

40
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,012
George is handsome.

41
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:57,580
- I liked Dexter.
- Why don't you postpone the wedding?

42
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:00,259
- How?
- Get smallpox.

43
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:03,263
- Don't put the idea in her head.
- George isn't usually late.

44
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:05,595
- He's waiting at the stables.
- Waiting...

45
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,102
- If I don't choke her before Saturday.
- It'd postpone the wedding.

46
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,695
It would not.
Be in the car when I get down.

47
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,474
She's so mean about Dexter.

48
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,134
He was rather mean to her.

49
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,644
- Did he really sock her?
- Please, Dinah.

50
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:21,773
- Did he really?
- Darling, go out and wait in the car.

51
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:24,409
- The papers were full of "innundo."
- Of what?

52
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:27,545
Of "innundo."
"Cruelty and drunkenness," it said.

53
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,550
Mother, why won't Tracy ask
her own father to the wedding?

54
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:36,324
Your sister has very definite
opinions about certain things.

55
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:37,887
She's sort of...

56
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:41,401
Well, you know,
hard, isn't she?

57
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:42,868
Certainly not.

58
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:46,168
Tracy sets exceptionally high standards
for herself, that's all...

59
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,676
and other people aren't always
quite apt to live up to them.

60
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:54,707
But don't you think it's stinking
not at least to want Father?

61
00:05:54,782 --> 00:05:58,445
Yes, darling. Between ourselves,
I think it's good and stinking.

62
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,920
Oh, I wish something would happen.

63
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:05,390
Nothing ever possibly
in the least ever happens here.

64
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:08,523
Mother...

65
00:06:09,397 --> 00:06:11,695
how do you get smallpox?

66
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:14,530
Oh, Dinah, please go. Go.

67
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:32,880
This is Uncle Willie's favorite:
Complete Surrender.

68
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:00,780
Where'd you get this
idiotic thing anyway?

69
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:06,581
Never play with fire, child,
particularly on the eve of your wedding.

70
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:09,054
You're really a wicked old man,
aren't you?

71
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,988
Who takes this, your cook?

72
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:13,356
I love it. It's got
pictures of everything.

73
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:15,429
It certainly has.

74
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:15,656
It certainly has.

75
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,190
Who is that terribly attractive man?
Can Tracy pick 'em, or can she?

76
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:22,498
- If you're asking me...
- I'm not.

77
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,095
- Hello, darling.
- Hello!

78
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:28,699
- How do you like me?
- I adore you, but you look awful.

79
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:31,267
- Awful?
- Like something out of a shop window.

80
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:37,279
Cut it out!
They're new!

81
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:39,581
They're new,
but they're not going to be.

82
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:42,122
- There, that's better.
- I don't get it.

83
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:45,158
When I was a coal miner, I wanted
enough money to buy clean clothes.

84
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:46,853
Now that I'm general manager...

85
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:50,125
Dinah, is there anything
in there about the wedding?

86
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:52,324
- What do you mean?
- I thought maybe...

87
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,494
you being one of the oldest
families in Philadelphia...

88
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,800
and me getting fairly
important myself...

89
00:07:57,872 --> 00:08:00,966
it's luck, of course, but I...
What's the matter?

90
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:03,533
"An average day in the life
of a congressman.

91
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:06,102
"The congressman's wife.
The kitchen, where is prepared...

92
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,273
"one banana, sliced,
two fried eggs.

93
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:11,284
- "The congressman kisses his wife."
- Lots of people like publicity.

94
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:15,311
Of all the filthy ideas, coming
into a private house with a camera.

95
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:20,053
George Kittredge, you get on that horse.
What do you think of that?

96
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:23,096
What would happen if someday
I got into politics?

97
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:25,962
- You'd be elected President.
- I don't know about that.

98
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:28,297
- I mean about publicity.
- Not in my home.

99
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:30,496
You mean our home, don't you?

100
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:35,073
Sorry, darling.
I mean very much our home.

101
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:45,451
Never mind, Eddie.
I'll get up myself.

102
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:48,411
Steady, Bessie.

103
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,153
Whoa, Bessie. Whoa.

104
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:02,260
Steady, Bessie.

105
00:09:03,437 --> 00:09:06,270
Grab the reins, George,
with the left hand.

106
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:10,933
- Put salt on his tail.
- Shut up.

107
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:12,445
Steady, Bessie.

108
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:15,639
There. Whoa, Bessie.

109
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:19,785
What's the matter, Bessie?
You act worried.

110
00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:21,879
Maybe it's because his name is Jack.

111
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,750
Hi-ho, Silver.

112
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:42,033
That does the trick.
Hello, Joe.

113
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:43,633
- Hi, Mike.
- I won't do it, Liz.

114
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:47,875
I'm gonna tell Sidney Kidd very plainly
I'm a writer, not a society snoop.

115
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:50,781
- I'm gonna tell him just that.
- Just that.

116
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,654
Let Kidd fire me!

117
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:57,919
Start writin' short stories again.
That's what I should be doin'.

118
00:09:57,992 --> 00:10:00,517
- I'm gonna tell him just that.
- Just that.

119
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,827
Come in.

120
00:10:16,977 --> 00:10:19,343
- I don't think you're being fair.
- No?

121
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:21,904
You're treating me like you
treat all your other writers.

122
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:26,179
You really hate me,
don't you, Connor?

123
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:29,188
No. I don't like you
very much, though.

124
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,120
You hate me, I trust,
Miss Imbrie?

125
00:10:33,194 --> 00:10:36,857
No. I can't afford to hate anybody.
I'm only a photographer.

126
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:41,625
Ask him to wait.

127
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,135
Your assignment will be Spy's
most sensational achievement:

128
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:48,505
Tracy Lord.

129
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:51,602
Big game hunting in Africa,
fox hunting in Pennsylvania...

130
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,113
married on impulse
and divorced in a rage...

131
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:57,344
and always unapproachable
by the press.

132
00:10:57,418 --> 00:10:59,579
"The Unapproachable Miss Lord."

133
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:02,952
"The Philadelphia Story."

134
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:06,823
"Closed were the portals
of snobbish fox hunting." No.

135
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:09,590
"No hunter of foxes
is Spy magazine."

136
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:12,291
Anyway, presented for
the first time, quote:

137
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:16,166
"A wedding day
inside mainline society."

138
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:20,173
"Or what the kitchen maid saw
through the keyhole." Unquote.

139
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:22,607
Writing's your job.
I'm only the publisher.

140
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:25,338
All right, publisher,
take this. Quote:

141
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:29,405
"No hunter of buckshot in the rear
is cagey, crafty Connor."

142
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:32,111
Unquote. Close paragraph.

143
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,848
Close job.
Close bank account.

144
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,591
But how can we possibly get inside
the Lord estate, let alone the house?

145
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,026
We're not gonna do it,
doggone it!

146
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:44,030
It's degrading!
It's undignified!

147
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:46,430
So is an empty stomach.
How do we get in?

148
00:11:51,272 --> 00:11:53,467
Ask the gentleman to come in.

149
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:06,611
- I understand we understand each other.
- Quite.

150
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:09,622
This gentleman has been employed
in our Buenos Aires office.

151
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,988
Fortunately, he came up
yesterday on the clipper...

152
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:14,789
and I believe he can
help us with our problem.

153
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:16,124
How?

154
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:19,564
Tracy Lord's brother Junius is
in the American embassy down there...

155
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:22,295
and he's an old friend
of this gentleman's.

156
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:25,668
He'll introduce you to the Lords
as intimate friends of Junius.

157
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:27,400
Dear old Junius.

158
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:30,375
This Tracy Lord,
does she know you?

159
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:32,810
You might say Miss Lord and I
grew up together.

160
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,111
You might also say
you were her first husband.

161
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:37,445
Yes, you might.

162
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:40,043
Holy mackerel.
What goes on here?

163
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,988
I remember your honeymoon very well,
you and she on a little sailboat.

164
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:47,357
- The True Love, wasn't it?
- How did you know?

165
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:50,363
I was the only photographer
whose camera you didn't smash.

166
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:53,889
You were terribly nice about it.
You threw it in the ocean.

167
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:55,868
One of those, huh?

168
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:59,030
Yes, I had the strange idea
our honeymoon was our own business.

169
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:03,566
Incidentally, he paid for the cameras.
I got a nice letter of apology too.

170
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:05,305
Always the gentleman, huh?

171
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:07,244
Except on occasion.

172
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:09,248
Now, what are the plans?

173
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:12,012
The wedding's Saturday.
Today is Thursday.

174
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:14,520
They should spend tomorrow night
as guests of the Lords.

175
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:16,579
There's somethin' screwy here.

176
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:20,753
If you've resigned, why are you
doin' all this unless you...

177
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:25,795
You wanna get even
with your ex-bride, huh?

178
00:13:27,368 --> 00:13:30,804
I'll have a car pick them up
at noon tomorrow in north Philadelphia.

179
00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:39,008
Mike, there's spit in your eye.
It shows.

180
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:58,988
Maybe they'd rather we go around
to the servants' entrance.

181
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,330
Maybe this is
the servants' entrance.

182
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:13,142
- Good morning, Edward.
- Why, Mr. Haven!

183
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:16,649
Is Mrs. Haven... I mean,
Miss Tracy or her mother in?

184
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:20,517
They may be at the swimming pool, sir.
Shall I announce you?

185
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:23,283
No. I'll go around myself
and surprise them.

186
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:25,825
It will indeed
be a surprise, sir.

187
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:28,691
These are friends of Mr. Junius's.
Have them wait in the south parlor.

188
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:30,354
Certainly, Mr. Haven.

189
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,532
Excuse me, sir.

190
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:48,037
The south parlor?

191
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:50,208
Miss Imbrie, the south parlor.

192
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:54,952
The queen will have bread and honey
at the usual time.

193
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:05,088
Seems a little cold
for the south parlor.

194
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:09,564
I'd rather expected to find
pickaninnies and banjos.

195
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:17,100
What's this room?
I forgot my compass.

196
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:24,611
This would be south-southwest
parlor by living room.

197
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:27,347
Knickknacks, gimcracks,
signed photographs.

198
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:30,652
You'd have to be as rich as the Lords
to live in a dump like this.

199
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:33,659
- I wouldn't live in it if they paid me.
- They won't.

200
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:47,033
Looks like they run
a hockshop on the side.

201
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:12,131
Just lookin' around.

202
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:37,753
I'll want your fingerprints for this.

203
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:44,629
Hey, what's this...
What's this guy Haven up to?

204
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:46,427
C.K. Dexter Haven.

205
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,266
What kind of a name is that?
C.K. Dexter Haven.

206
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:52,931
Macaulay Connor's
no homespun tag, my pet.

207
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:55,634
Yeah, you just try
callin' me Macaulay.

208
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:57,472
I knew a plain Joe Smith once.

209
00:16:57,544 --> 00:17:01,310
He was only a clerk in a hardware store,
but he was an absolute rat.

210
00:17:04,418 --> 00:17:06,181
C.K. Dexter Haven.

211
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:10,383
He plays polo, he designs
sailboats, "class" boats.

212
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:13,085
- Very upper class.
- Don't despair.

213
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,526
He's out. Kittredge,
man of the people, is in.

214
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:18,656
Quite a comer too, I understand.
Political timber.

215
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:20,825
Poor guy. I wonder
how he fell for it.

216
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:24,268
Uh-oh, Liz. What did I tell you?
How do you like this?

217
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:28,104
"Living room, sitting room,
terrace, pool, stables."

218
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:31,110
That's so they can talk to the horses
without having them in the house.

219
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:33,612
Don't, Mike!

220
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:41,219
Yes?

221
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:43,017
This is the bridal suite.

222
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,718
Send up some caviar sandwiches
and a bottle of beer.

223
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,555
What? Who is this?

224
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:50,358
This is the voice of doom calling.

225
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,264
Your days are numbered,
to the seventh son of the seventh son!

226
00:17:57,471 --> 00:18:00,338
- Hello? Hello?
- What's the matter?

227
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,910
One of the servants
has been at the sherry again.

228
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:09,773
- Dexter, you've come back!
- Ah, Dinah, my dream girl!

229
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,784
What in the name of...

230
00:18:13,187 --> 00:18:16,850
No, it can't be. He went to
South America for two years.

231
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:19,586
Edward said they were
at the swimming pool.

232
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,093
They seem to be here.

233
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:28,157
Dexter, don't you know
that tomorrow is the wedding?

234
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:30,260
Oh, that's right.
So it is.

235
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:34,871
You can go right back
where you came from!

236
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:37,376
Can't. Dinah says it's
awful here without me.

237
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,537
Hello, you sweet thing.

238
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,808
Red, you look in the pink.

239
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,517
You don't think I'd miss
your wedding, do you?

240
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:48,987
- Dexter, you wouldn't.
- I'm not so sure he wouldn't.

241
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:52,025
No, Mother Lord, I wouldn't.
I assure you I wouldn't.

242
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:54,686
- Tell us all about Junius.
- Stay 'til lunch.

243
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:58,788
Don't open your house. Stay here.
We're having no guests over the wedding.

244
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:03,128
- How about the groom?
- He's staying at the gatehouse.

245
00:19:03,203 --> 00:19:04,534
Oh, that's good.

246
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:06,835
- Junius is fine.
- He should be here.

247
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:09,569
He's heartbroken. I suggested
representing him as best man...

248
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:13,443
I'm afraid that George might prefer
to have his best man sober.

249
00:19:13,513 --> 00:19:15,174
I wish you'd represent George.

250
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:18,650
That's my loyal little girl.
You'll like the people Junius did send.

251
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:21,745
You haven't switched from liquor
to dope, by any chance?

252
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:24,120
- You see?
- The people Junius did send?

253
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:27,092
You don't know a Macaulay Connor
or Elizabeth Imbrie, do you?

254
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,754
- We can finish these later.
- I'd better introduce you.

255
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,732
Call me for...
Introduce me to whom?

256
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,769
To Miss Imbrie and Mr. Connor,
to tell them which rooms they'd have.

257
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:40,671
Mr. Connor is asking if he should wear
a black or white tie to tonight's party.

258
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:44,302
- Rooms?
- I'd better start from the beginning.

259
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:47,040
Sit down, dear.
They're great friends of Junius's.

260
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:50,311
And they expect to stay here?
I think that's very queer.

261
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:53,217
I think it's queerer than that.
I think it's paranoiac.

262
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:56,723
You see, it was Junius's idea.
They've been very kind to him, and...

263
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,657
You're lying, Dexter.
I can always tell.

264
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:01,660
- Can you, Red?
- They're Junius's friends.

265
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:04,196
You went to work after
the divorce, didn't you?

266
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:07,062
Yes, except for a brief interlude
in some alcoholic sanitariums.

267
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:09,329
You took a job
in South America. Who for?

268
00:20:09,403 --> 00:20:12,099
- A magazine.
- It wasn't Spy magazine?

269
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:13,901
You are a mass of intuition.

270
00:20:13,974 --> 00:20:17,102
I don't suppose that Junius's
friends are photographers?

271
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:19,668
- I thought you were low, but I never...
- What are you going to do?

272
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:22,681
- After I've telephoned Junius...
- Wait, Red.

273
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:24,740
Don't telephone Junius.
I'll confess.

274
00:20:30,524 --> 00:20:32,719
No. You're slipping, Red.

275
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:36,752
I used to be afraid of that look,
the withering glance of the goddess.

276
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,390
I didn't think that alcohol would...
Oh, shut up.

277
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:43,466
Dinah, stay here.

278
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:46,097
Please, Mother.
Maybe he's going to sock her.

279
00:20:46,173 --> 00:20:50,132
Don't say "sock," darling.
"Strike" is quite an ugly enough word.

280
00:20:51,845 --> 00:20:54,279
Who do they think they are,
barging in on peaceful people?

281
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:58,079
- They'll think you don't want them.
- I want them out, and you too!

282
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:01,780
Yes, your majesty. But first could I
interest you in some small blackmail?

283
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:07,056
It's an article, complete with
snapshots, details and insinuations...

284
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:09,561
and it's ready for
publication in Spy...

285
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:12,097
and it's about your father
and that dancer in New York.

286
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:14,133
About Father and Tina Mara?

287
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:16,533
Quiet. Dinah.

288
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:19,936
But they can't,
even if it's true.

289
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:24,039
- Where do you get these?
- From Sidney Kidd, editor and publisher.

290
00:21:24,111 --> 00:21:27,740
- He's got to be stopped.
- He is, temporarily.

291
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:31,250
That is, if you'll allow those two
to turn in the story on your wedding.

292
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:34,344
And when Kidd says a story,
he means a story.

293
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:36,184
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Yes, dear.

294
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:38,986
"An Intimate Day
With a Society Bride."

295
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,492
I am sick.

296
00:21:41,495 --> 00:21:43,554
It's tough, but that's
the way it seems to be.

297
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,531
So I'm to be examined, undressed
and generally humiliated...

298
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,568
at 15 cents a copy.

299
00:21:48,635 --> 00:21:51,661
And you, you...
You're loving it.

300
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:53,262
Am I, Red?

301
00:21:59,045 --> 00:22:00,478
Mother, we're hooked.

302
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:02,947
- Are they really reporters?
- Not even friends of Junius's?

303
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:05,644
They aren't anybody's friends,
but we're to pretend they are.

304
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,209
- But why?
- Don't ask me.

305
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:09,847
There's a good reason,
and it's my wedding, so please!

306
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:12,517
I'll bet it's on account
of Father and that dancer.

307
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:15,083
- Dinah, what do you know?
- I listen around.

308
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:17,687
Is there no such thing
as privacy anymore?

309
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:20,232
Only in bed, Mother,
and not always there.

310
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,564
Watching every little mannerism...

311
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:25,298
jotting down notes on how we sit,
stand, talk, eat and move!

312
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:29,240
- Will they do that?
- All in that horrible, snide English.

313
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:32,472
If we have to submit to it
to save Father's face...

314
00:22:32,546 --> 00:22:34,605
which, incidentally,
doesn't deserve it...

315
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:38,014
I'll give them a picture of home life
that'll stand their hair on end!

316
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:43,049
Tracy, we must just be ourselves,
very much ourselves.

317
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:45,921
But you want us to create
a good impression, don't you?

318
00:22:45,992 --> 00:22:48,324
They don't know that we know
what they're here for?

319
00:22:48,395 --> 00:22:50,761
No. That was understood.
The girl's quite nice.

320
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:53,163
He writes short stories.
Very down to earth.

321
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:56,134
- They'll love us.
- Oh, dear, you'd both better dress.

322
00:22:56,203 --> 00:23:00,264
And both of you, promise to behave
like ladies in front of these creatures.

323
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,798
We'll do our best, Mrs. Lord.
I don't know how good that is.

324
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:11,781
Dexter, how perfectly dreadful.

325
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:15,288
What'll they say about Seth not being
here for his own daughter's wedding?

326
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:19,591
I know, dear.

327
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:26,922
You'd better go and tell them how
terribly happy we are to have them.

328
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,525
That's the old Quaker spirit,
Mother Lord.

329
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:31,195
Keep swinging.

330
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:40,871
Oh. I thought it was that butler.

331
00:23:40,947 --> 00:23:43,040
The family will be down
to welcome you.

332
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:45,107
- What with?
- With open arms.

333
00:23:45,185 --> 00:23:47,847
They're terribly happy to have
any friends of Junius's here.

334
00:23:47,921 --> 00:23:50,014
- Do they know about us?
- Why should they?

335
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,424
Look, Haven, our research department
didn't give us much data.

336
00:23:54,494 --> 00:23:58,521
This fiancé of this girl,
George Kittredge, age 32?

337
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:00,759
- You know him very well?
- Well enough.

338
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:05,134
"General manager of Quaker State Coal,
company owned by Seth Lord."

339
00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:07,935
- That's the girl's father, huh?
- What a coincidence.

340
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:09,771
How'd he meet her?

341
00:24:09,843 --> 00:24:12,277
Heaven brought them together,
I imagine.

342
00:24:13,947 --> 00:24:15,380
"Seth Lord.

343
00:24:15,448 --> 00:24:18,440
"See Banker's Annual,
Directory of Directors."

344
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:20,543
- Is there a library in town?
- Yes.

345
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,611
I suppose you wouldn't
know where that is?

346
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:25,681
Well, roughly.
My grandfather built it.

347
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:31,356
Now, about this girl...

348
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:34,195
"Tracy Samantha Lord."

349
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:35,700
What about her?

350
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:38,329
Well, what's her
leading characteristic?

351
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:41,465
She has a horror of men
who wear their hats in the house.

352
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:46,103
Leading characteristics
to be filled in later.

353
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:48,545
I can fill them in right now.

354
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:52,415
The young, rich, rapacious
American female.

355
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:54,419
No other country
where she exists.

356
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:57,081
And would I change places
with Tracy Samantha Lord...

357
00:24:57,157 --> 00:24:59,682
for all her wealth and beauty?

358
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,125
Oh, boy, just ask me.

359
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,822
Well, tell four footmen to call me
in time for lunch, will you?

360
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,104
How do you do?

361
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:20,769
Friends of my brother Junius,
are you not?

362
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:22,144
I am Dinah Lord.

363
00:25:22,215 --> 00:25:24,513
My real name is Diana,
but my sister changed it.

364
00:25:24,584 --> 00:25:26,779
I'm Elizabeth Imbrie.
This is Macaulay Connor.

365
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:31,051
Enchantée de vous voir!
Enchantée de faire votre connaissance!

366
00:25:31,124 --> 00:25:33,092
I spoke French
before I spoke English.

367
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,390
My early childhood was spent in Paris
where my father worked in a bank:

368
00:25:36,463 --> 00:25:38,192
- The House of Morgan.
- Really?

369
00:25:38,264 --> 00:25:40,357
C'est vrai absolument!

370
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:44,130
Can you play the piano?
I can, and sing at the same time!

371
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:45,637
Listen.

372
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:57,746
Lydia, oh, Lydia
Say, have you met Lydia

373
00:25:57,817 --> 00:26:00,877
Oh, Lydia
the tattooed lady

374
00:26:00,954 --> 00:26:03,787
She has eyes
that folks adore so

375
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:07,020
And a torso even more so

376
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:09,323
What is this?

377
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:10,829
Idiot, probably.

378
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:12,592
The queen of tattoos

379
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:15,829
On her back
is the battle of Waterloo

380
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:18,564
Beside it the wreck
of the Hesperus too

381
00:26:18,638 --> 00:26:22,404
And proudly above
waves the red, white

382
00:26:22,475 --> 00:26:24,340
And blue

383
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:28,142
You can learn a lot from Lydia

384
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:31,308
Ah, petite soeur,
tu es un véritable petit Chopin!

385
00:26:31,384 --> 00:26:32,976
- Tu trouves?
- Mais certainement.

386
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:36,079
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
Voyons, tu es pâle.

387
00:26:36,156 --> 00:26:39,922
Montre-moi ta langue. J'espere bien
que ce n'est pas le smallpox.

388
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:41,654
- Le smallpox?
- Mais oui.

389
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:43,662
Va dire a maman de se dépecher!

390
00:26:48,735 --> 00:26:51,465
Oh. How do you do?

391
00:26:53,106 --> 00:26:54,937
I'm Tracy Lord.

392
00:26:55,008 --> 00:26:57,909
It's so nice having you here.
How did you leave Junius?

393
00:26:57,977 --> 00:27:00,275
We left Junius fine.
That little sister of yours...

394
00:27:00,346 --> 00:27:02,473
Isn't she a dear?
So talented.

395
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:06,110
- Junius is such a lamb, isn't he?
- Yes, isn't he?

396
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:10,555
It's a pity none of the male members
of the family are going to be here.

397
00:27:10,623 --> 00:27:13,717
- Where's your father?
- Darling Papa.

398
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:16,489
- I do hope you'll stay for my wedding.
- We'd like to very much.

399
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:19,623
- That was our idea.
- I'm so glad that it occurred to you.

400
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:22,259
The house is in rather
a mess, of course.

401
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:26,294
We'll all have to huddle here
and overflow onto the porch.

402
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:31,970
- I hope your rooms are comfortable.
- Your father sick?

403
00:27:33,446 --> 00:27:36,882
- What a cunning little camera.
- I'm an awful nuisance with it.

404
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,544
But you couldn't be.
I hope you'll take loads.

405
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:42,417
Dear Papa and Mama aren't
allowing any reporters in.

406
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:46,186
That is, except for little Mr. Grace,
who does the social news.

407
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:48,989
Can you imagine a grown-up man
having to sink so low?

408
00:27:49,062 --> 00:27:51,587
It does seem kind of bad.

409
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:55,567
You're a kind of writer...

410
00:27:55,635 --> 00:27:58,229
- aren't you, Mr. Connor?
- Sort of.

411
00:27:58,304 --> 00:27:59,771
- A book?
- Yes.

412
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,103
Under what name do you publish?

413
00:28:02,175 --> 00:28:05,042
My own. Macaulay Connor.

414
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:08,814
What's the Macaulay for?

415
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:11,180
Well, my father
taught English history.

416
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:13,310
I'm "Mike" to my friends.

417
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:16,184
Of whom you have many, I'm sure.

418
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,781
English history,
it's always fascinated me:

419
00:28:18,858 --> 00:28:21,452
Cromwell, Robin Hood,
Jack the Ripper.

420
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:24,258
Where did he teach?
I mean, your father.

421
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,798
In a little high school
in South Bend, Indiana.

422
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:28,333
South Bend.

423
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:30,801
It sounds like dancing,
doesn't it?

424
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,395
You must have had a most
happy childhood there.

425
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:35,498
- Yeah, it was terrific.
- I'm so glad.

426
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:38,510
- I didn't mean it that way.
- I'm so sorry. Why?

427
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:41,547
Well, lack of wherewithal,
I guess.

428
00:28:41,614 --> 00:28:44,947
But that doesn't always cause
unhappiness, does it?

429
00:28:45,018 --> 00:28:46,679
Not if you're
the right kind of man.

430
00:28:46,753 --> 00:28:50,314
George Kittredge, my fiancé,
never had anything either, and he...

431
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,880
Are either of you married?

432
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:56,895
You mean you were,
but now you're divorced.

433
00:28:56,963 --> 00:28:59,796
- The fact is...
- Surely you're not ashamed of it.

434
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:02,232
- Of course I'm not.
- What?

435
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:05,294
It was years ago.
I was only a kid in Duluth.

436
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:07,464
Good heavens, Liz.
You never told me.

437
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,441
- You never asked me.
- I know, but you...

438
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:13,879
Joe Smith, hardware.

439
00:29:15,448 --> 00:29:18,417
You're the darnedest girl, Liz.

440
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:19,917
I think I'm sweet.

441
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:25,318
Duluth must be a lovely spot.
It's west of here, isn't it?

442
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:28,189
Sort of, but occasionally
we get the breezes...

443
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:30,695
And this is your first visit
in Philadelphia.

444
00:29:30,763 --> 00:29:33,527
It's a quaint old place,
don't you think? Filled with relics.

445
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,591
And how old are you, Mr. Connor?

446
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:36,794
Thirty.

447
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,804
One book isn't much
for a man of 30.

448
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,271
I don't mean to criticize.

449
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,740
You probably have other interests
outside your work.

450
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:44,276
None.

451
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:45,902
I mean us.

452
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:48,478
How sweet.

453
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:51,039
Are you going together?

454
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:56,086
- I beg your pardon?
- That is an odd question.

455
00:29:56,155 --> 00:29:59,522
I don't see why.
I think it's very interesting.

456
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:02,988
Miss Imbrie, don't you agree...

457
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:05,758
that if a man says he loves a girl,
he ought to marry her?

458
00:30:05,832 --> 00:30:07,197
Can she be human?

459
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:09,895
Please, Mr. Connor.
I asked Miss Imbrie a question.

460
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:11,527
Well, that depends. L...

461
00:30:11,604 --> 00:30:13,196
I'll see what's keeping Mama.

462
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:25,716
Who's doing the interviewing here?

463
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:29,947
- You don't suppose she caught on?
- No, she was born that way.

464
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:32,389
- Don't let her throw ya.
- Do you want to take over?

465
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:35,655
- I wanna go home.
- Ah, here you are.

466
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:38,128
How do you do?
We're so happy to have you.

467
00:30:38,197 --> 00:30:41,792
Forgive me for not coming in sooner,
but things are in such a state.

468
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:43,301
My little girl.

469
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:46,099
She's going to leave me.

470
00:30:46,172 --> 00:30:50,165
Aren't you pretty, my dear.
But then Junius's friends always are.

471
00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:52,643
Look at the way
she wears her hair, Tracy.

472
00:30:52,712 --> 00:30:55,340
- Isn't it pretty?
- Mighty fine.

473
00:30:57,784 --> 00:30:59,718
Shall we have sherry on the porch?

474
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:09,387
- This is my youngest daughter, Diana.
- I think we've met.

475
00:31:09,462 --> 00:31:12,556
I wish my husband could be here.
We expect him presently.

476
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:16,398
He's detained in New York on business
for that lovely dancer, Tina Mara.

477
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:18,733
- Do you know her work?
- Not professionally.

478
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:20,796
So talented,
and such a lovely person...

479
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:23,467
but like so many artists,
no business head.

480
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:24,840
None whatever.

481
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:27,846
I have some lovely presents,
don't you think so, Mr. Connor?

482
00:31:38,091 --> 00:31:39,388
Hello, everybody.

483
00:31:41,828 --> 00:31:44,228
- I hope I'm not late.
- You're never late, George.

484
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:49,530
We have a lovely surprise. Junius has
sent these people as a wedding present.

485
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:52,366
Mr. Kittredge,
this is Miss... I'm so sorry.

486
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:54,599
- Imbrie.
- Any friend of Junius's is my friend.

487
00:31:54,674 --> 00:31:56,608
And, uh, Mr. Morrow?

488
00:31:56,676 --> 00:31:58,541
- I didn't get the name.
- Connor.

489
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:00,806
Macauley Connor.

490
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,869
He's a writer.

491
00:32:01,948 --> 00:32:03,313
Don't apologize, Mrs. Lord.

492
00:32:03,383 --> 00:32:05,749
No apology necessary.
I have great respect for writers.

493
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:07,843
Well, thank you.
Any kind word is...

494
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,388
- How are you?
- Much better now that you're here.

495
00:32:10,456 --> 00:32:12,686
Oh, I guess this
must be love, huh?

496
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:16,092
- Your guess is correct.
- I'm just his faithful old dog Tray.

497
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:18,562
- Give me your paw.
- You've got it.

498
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:21,055
How sweet.

499
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:24,126
Say, I'd like to see
one of those, Miss Imbrie.

500
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:25,431
You will.

501
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:27,097
Shall we have some sherry?

502
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:30,438
I suppose Junius has told you
all about our happy little family.

503
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,070
- Papa!
- What?

504
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,140
Dear Papa.

505
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:42,020
You angel to get here
in time for lunch!

506
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:44,352
- Isn't he, Mama?
- Indeed he is, but...

507
00:32:44,424 --> 00:32:46,858
Father, these are our friends,
Miss Imbrie and Mr. Connor.

508
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:50,987
- How are you, Mr. Lord?
- Oh, just fine, thank you.

509
00:32:51,064 --> 00:32:52,998
- How are you?
- How do you do?

510
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:54,363
How do you do?

511
00:32:54,434 --> 00:32:55,833
Howdy, Pops.

512
00:32:55,902 --> 00:32:57,494
Oh, dear Dinah.

513
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:01,366
- Father, here's George.
- How are you, Kittredge?

514
00:33:01,441 --> 00:33:02,772
Margaret, my sweet.

515
00:33:02,842 --> 00:33:05,936
- Another place for luncheon, Edward.
- Very good, madam.

516
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:09,746
Well... here I am...

517
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:11,750
in the bosom of my...

518
00:33:11,818 --> 00:33:14,082
- Hello, friends and enemies.
- Young man!

519
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:17,484
- Remove yourself.
- How are you, sir?

520
00:33:17,557 --> 00:33:19,889
I don't know. Get along.

521
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,893
Darling, I've changed my mind.
I will stay for lunch.

522
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:23,588
Another place, Edward.

523
00:33:23,663 --> 00:33:26,029
- Hello, Kittredge.
- How are you, Haven?

524
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:27,726
Just Damon and Pythias.

525
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,098
No, Grant and Lee.

526
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:39,844
You don't look as well as when
I last saw you, Kittredge.

527
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:42,847
Oh, you poor fellow.
I know just how you feel.

528
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,551
- How's it coming?
- Beautifully, Dexter.

529
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:50,316
We're so indebted to you
for these lovely people.

530
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:52,857
It's almost impossible
to repay that debt.

531
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:54,859
But you'll manage, eh, Red?

532
00:33:56,562 --> 00:33:59,759
- They grew up together, you know.
- How nice.

533
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:01,857
You don't look old enough
to get married...

534
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:03,993
not even the first time,
but then you never did.

535
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,937
She needs trouble to mature her,
Kittredge. Give her lots of it.

536
00:34:07,006 --> 00:34:09,167
I'm afraid she can't
count on me for that.

537
00:34:09,242 --> 00:34:11,107
No? That's too bad.

538
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:13,941
For your own sake, Red,
you should have stuck to me longer.

539
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:17,244
I thought it was for life, but the nice
judge gave me a full pardon.

540
00:34:17,316 --> 00:34:20,479
Ah, that's the old redhead.
No bitterness, no recrimination.

541
00:34:20,553 --> 00:34:22,748
Just a good swift left to the jaw.

542
00:34:26,726 --> 00:34:28,853
They grew up together.

543
00:34:30,897 --> 00:34:32,831
Luncheon is served, madam.

544
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:36,062
Oh, thank you, Edward. Come sit.
We have so much to talk about.

545
00:34:36,135 --> 00:34:40,868
I don't suppose a man ever had
a better or finer family.

546
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,033
I often wake up in the night
and say to myself...

547
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:46,545
"Seth, you lucky dog,
what have you done to deserve it all?"

548
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:48,102
And what have you?

549
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:54,350
Oh, thank you.

550
00:34:57,757 --> 00:35:00,351
Oh, how stupid of me!

551
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:04,092
Oh, dear! How awful!

552
00:35:04,163 --> 00:35:06,097
I had a feeling
that would happen.

553
00:35:06,165 --> 00:35:09,760
Your camera.
I'm so, so sorry.

554
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:11,325
I'm sure you are.

555
00:35:17,543 --> 00:35:18,976
What is it?

556
00:35:19,045 --> 00:35:20,205
Your father.

557
00:35:22,348 --> 00:35:23,610
Uncle Willie!

558
00:35:26,419 --> 00:35:29,547
- Uncle Willie, how nice.
- I beg your pardon.

559
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:32,853
Please go on into lunch, everyone.
I want a word with Uncle Willie.

560
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:35,894
- Another place, Edward.
- Yes, madam.

561
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:43,464
I'm afraid I don't understand.

562
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:46,403
You never have, but you
came anyway, didn't you?

563
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:51,068
Oh. Still Justice with her
shining sword, eh, daughter?

564
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:54,112
- Who's on the spot?
- We are, thanks to you...

565
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,613
Uncle Willie.

566
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:03,784
How long will you be researching?

567
00:36:03,856 --> 00:36:07,155
Not long if I can find the right books...
his family history and stuff like that.

568
00:36:07,226 --> 00:36:09,421
There's a cousin Joanna
that's definitely crazy.

569
00:36:09,495 --> 00:36:10,792
- Who told you?
- Dinah.

570
00:36:10,863 --> 00:36:13,457
- Dinah should know.
- Come across the street when you finish.

571
00:36:13,532 --> 00:36:15,295
- Miss Hobson's establishment.
- Okay.

572
00:36:43,195 --> 00:36:44,628
What does thee wish?

573
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:46,665
I'm looking for some local b...

574
00:36:49,235 --> 00:36:52,204
- What'd you say?
- What does thee wish?

575
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:57,237
Um, local biography or history.

576
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,074
If thee will, consult with
my colleague in there.

577
00:37:05,518 --> 00:37:07,611
Dost thou have a washroom?

578
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:10,817
Thank thee.

579
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:34,712
I know this is a public library,
but I wou...

580
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,839
- Hello.
- Hello.

581
00:37:39,618 --> 00:37:41,950
Couldn't you afford
to buy my book?

582
00:37:42,021 --> 00:37:43,716
The bookstore didn't have one.

583
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:45,916
Are you sure you're doing
the right thing?

584
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:48,687
You know what happens to girls like you
when they read books like mine.

585
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:51,161
They begin to think.
That's bad.

586
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,357
These stories are beautiful.

587
00:37:53,432 --> 00:37:55,457
Why, Connor,
they're almost poetry.

588
00:37:56,635 --> 00:37:59,365
Don't kid yourself. They are.

589
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:01,906
I can't make you out at all now.

590
00:38:01,974 --> 00:38:05,102
Really?
I thought I was easy.

591
00:38:05,177 --> 00:38:08,408
So did I, but you're not.

592
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:13,643
You talk so big and tough,
and then you write like this.

593
00:38:14,754 --> 00:38:16,221
Which is which?

594
00:38:17,957 --> 00:38:19,652
Both, I guess.

595
00:38:21,627 --> 00:38:25,757
No, I believe you put the toughness on
to save your skin.

596
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:29,100
You think so?

597
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:31,102
I know a little about that.

598
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:34,303
- Do you?
- Quite a lot.

599
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:40,278
Let's get out of here.

600
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:52,347
This book was just such
a complete surprise to me.

601
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:55,258
L... let's walk, shall we?
Lt'll be much more fun.

602
00:38:55,327 --> 00:38:57,795
Take this. Tell Mr. Kittredge
we'll meet him at the pool.

603
00:38:57,863 --> 00:38:59,296
Yes, Miss Tracy.

604
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:06,265
The story called, "With The Rich
and Mighty," I think I liked it best.

605
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:09,239
I got it from
a Spanish peasant's proverb.

606
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:11,936
"With the rich and mighty,
always a little patience."

607
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:13,308
I like that.

608
00:39:16,515 --> 00:39:18,608
What's the matter?
A little too rough?

609
00:39:18,684 --> 00:39:20,117
A little...

610
00:39:20,186 --> 00:39:21,949
but I'm used to it.

611
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,987
Tell me something, will you?

612
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:30,085
When you can do a thing like that book,
how can you possibly do anything else?

613
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:34,428
You may not believe this, but there
are people that must earn their living.

614
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,832
Of course, but people
buy books, don't they?

615
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:38,836
Not as long as there's
a library around.

616
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:43,266
That book of mine represents
two solid years' work...

617
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:47,039
and it netted Connor
something under $600.

618
00:39:47,112 --> 00:39:50,548
- But that shouldn't be.
- Unhappily it is.

619
00:39:50,616 --> 00:39:53,084
This is beautiful country around here.
What is it all, anyway?

620
00:39:53,152 --> 00:39:56,644
Part of our place.
What about your Miss Imbrie?

621
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:58,883
Well, Miss Imbrie's
in somewhat the same fix.

622
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:01,256
She's a born painter and might be
a very important one...

623
00:40:01,327 --> 00:40:05,058
but Miss Imbrie must eat, and she also
prefers a roof over her head...

624
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,156
to being constantly out
in the rain and snow.

625
00:40:08,234 --> 00:40:09,667
Food and a roof.

626
00:40:12,304 --> 00:40:14,932
You've really got something here.

627
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:16,634
- Where?
- All this.

628
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:20,345
Oh. Come on.
The dressing rooms are over here.

629
00:40:22,748 --> 00:40:24,773
I think you'll find
everything you need.

630
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:31,053
Use any old one, but I think you'll find
most of the junk in there.

631
00:40:31,123 --> 00:40:33,182
- Yell if you need anything.
- Okay.

632
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:52,201
I have an idea.

633
00:40:53,612 --> 00:40:56,342
I have the most wonderful
little house in Uniondale.

634
00:40:57,249 --> 00:41:00,946
It's up on a hill with a view
that would knock you silly.

635
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,113
I'm never there except
in the hunting season...

636
00:41:03,188 --> 00:41:06,351
and not much then,
and I'd be so happy to know...

637
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,985
that it was of some real use
to someone.

638
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:14,022
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

639
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,028
There's a brook and a small lake...

640
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:19,866
no size, really...

641
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:22,931
and a patch of woods,
and in any kind of weather...

642
00:41:23,008 --> 00:41:25,272
it's the most wonderful...

643
00:41:25,344 --> 00:41:29,337
Well, anyhow, I'm so delighted
that I can offer it to you.

644
00:41:30,482 --> 00:41:33,212
Well, it's terribly nice of you,
but, uh...

645
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:37,315
Heck, that's Dexter.

646
00:41:38,857 --> 00:41:42,156
Look, if he comes here,
stand by, will you?

647
00:41:42,227 --> 00:41:44,718
- I don't want to be alone with him.
- Certainly, if you like.

648
00:41:44,797 --> 00:41:47,664
Isn't it lucky that I happened
to think about that house?

649
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:50,725
And don't think I'd come trooping in
every minute, because I wouldn't.

650
00:41:50,803 --> 00:41:53,601
I'd never come
except when expressly asked to.

651
00:41:53,672 --> 00:41:57,369
- Well, it isn't that.
- What is it?

652
00:41:57,443 --> 00:41:59,377
Well, you see,
the idea of artists...

653
00:41:59,445 --> 00:42:03,438
depending upon a patron lady bountiful
has more or less gone out.

654
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,810
Oh. I see.

655
00:42:09,421 --> 00:42:13,755
That wasn't especially kind
of you, Mr. Connor.

656
00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:16,226
I'm sorry to have seemed patronizing.

657
00:42:16,295 --> 00:42:18,456
- Now, look, I didn't mean...
- Please don't bother.

658
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,764
- Hello.
- Hello. Fancy seeing you here.

659
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,535
Orange juice? Certainly.

660
00:42:29,608 --> 00:42:32,736
Don't tell me you've forsaken
your beloved whiskey and whiskeys.

661
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:35,006
No, I've just changed their color.

662
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,572
I'm going for the pale pastel shades.
They're more becoming to me.

663
00:42:38,651 --> 00:42:40,642
How about you, Mr. Connor?
You drink, don't you?

664
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,710
- Alcohol, I mean.
- A little.

665
00:42:42,788 --> 00:42:44,983
A little?
And you're a writer?

666
00:42:45,057 --> 00:42:48,549
Tsk, tsk, tsk. I thought all writers
drank to excess and beat their wives.

667
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:52,188
You know, at one time I think
I secretly wanted to be a writer.

668
00:42:53,899 --> 00:42:57,027
Dexter, would you mind
doing something for me?

669
00:42:57,102 --> 00:42:59,093
- Anything. What?
- Get the heck out of here.

670
00:42:59,171 --> 00:43:00,638
I couldn't do that.

671
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:02,674
That wouldn't be fair to you.
You need me too much.

672
00:43:02,741 --> 00:43:05,175
Would you tell me what
you're hanging around for?

673
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:08,543
- No, please don't go, Mr. Connor.
- No, please don't go, Mr. Connor.

674
00:43:08,614 --> 00:43:10,980
As a writer, this ought to be
right up your street.

675
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,517
Don't miss a word.

676
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:17,219
I never saw you looking better, Red.
You're getting that fine, tawny look.

677
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:21,020
Oh, we're going to talk
about me, are we? Goody.

678
00:43:21,093 --> 00:43:24,426
It's astonishing what money can do
for people, don't you agree, Mr. Connor?

679
00:43:24,496 --> 00:43:26,930
Not too much, you know.
Just more than enough.

680
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:30,200
Take Tracy, for example.

681
00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:32,533
There was never a blow that
hasn't been softened for her.

682
00:43:32,604 --> 00:43:35,539
Never a blow that won't be softened.
It's even changed her shape.

683
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:40,169
- She was once a dumpy little thing.
- I'm not interested in myself now.

684
00:43:40,245 --> 00:43:43,271
Not interested in yourself?
You're fascinated, Red.

685
00:43:43,348 --> 00:43:45,714
You're far and away
your favorite person in the world.

686
00:43:45,784 --> 00:43:47,775
- In case you don't know...
- Of course, Mr. Connor...

687
00:43:47,853 --> 00:43:49,912
she's a girl
who's generous to a fault.

688
00:43:49,988 --> 00:43:51,683
To a fault, Mr. Connor.

689
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:53,884
Except to other people's faults.

690
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:55,927
For instance, she never had
any understanding...

691
00:43:55,994 --> 00:43:57,552
of my deep and gorgeous thirst.

692
00:43:57,629 --> 00:43:59,961
- That was your problem.
- Granted.

693
00:44:00,032 --> 00:44:03,024
But you took on that problem
with me when you took me, Red.

694
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:05,161
You were no helpmate there.
You were a scold.

695
00:44:05,237 --> 00:44:08,206
It was disgusting.
It made you so unattractive.

696
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:11,470
A weakness, sure, and strength
is her religion, Mr. Connor.

697
00:44:11,543 --> 00:44:14,239
She finds human imperfection
unforgivable.

698
00:44:15,481 --> 00:44:17,745
When I discovered that
my relationship to her...

699
00:44:17,816 --> 00:44:21,081
was supposed to be not that of a loving
husband and a good companion but...

700
00:44:22,588 --> 00:44:24,579
- Oh, never mind.
- Say it.

701
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:28,460
But that of a kind of high priest
to a virgin goddess.

702
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:32,593
Then my drinks grew deeper
and more frequent.

703
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:36,359
I never considered you as that
nor myself.

704
00:44:36,435 --> 00:44:38,494
You did it without knowing it.

705
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:43,132
And the night that you got drunk on
champagne and climbed out on the roof...

706
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:46,609
and stood there, naked,
with your arms out to the moon...

707
00:44:46,678 --> 00:44:48,168
wailing like a banshee.

708
00:44:49,748 --> 00:44:52,717
I never had the slightest recollection
of doing any such thing.

709
00:44:52,785 --> 00:44:55,549
You drew a blank.
You wanted to.

710
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:57,612
Mr. Connor, what would you... oh.

711
00:44:59,057 --> 00:45:01,184
A nice story for Spy,
incidentally.

712
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,524
Yes. Too bad we can't supply
photographs of you on the roof.

713
00:45:03,595 --> 00:45:06,120
Honestly, the fuss you made
over that silly, childish epis...

714
00:45:06,198 --> 00:45:09,292
It was enormously important
and most revealing.

715
00:45:09,368 --> 00:45:12,701
The moon is also a goddess,
chaste and virginal.

716
00:45:12,771 --> 00:45:15,331
Stop using those foul words.

717
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:17,967
What are you trying
to make me out as?

718
00:45:18,043 --> 00:45:21,137
- What do you fancy yourself as?
- I don't know that I fancy myself...

719
00:45:21,213 --> 00:45:23,272
When I read you're gonna marry
Kittredge I couldn't believe it.

720
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:25,612
That's why I'm here.
How could he even think of it?

721
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,379
Because he's everything you're not.

722
00:45:27,452 --> 00:45:30,478
He's been poor, he's had to work,
and he's had to fight for everything...

723
00:45:30,556 --> 00:45:33,957
and I love him as I never
even began to love you.

724
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:37,462
Maybe so, but I doubt it.
It's just a swing from me...

725
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,463
but it's too violent a swing.

726
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:41,624
Kittredge is no great
tower of strength.

727
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,395
He's just a tower.

728
00:45:43,468 --> 00:45:45,026
You hardly know him.

729
00:45:45,103 --> 00:45:47,071
To hardly know him
is to know him well.

730
00:45:47,139 --> 00:45:50,575
Perhaps it offends my vanity to have
anyone who was even remotely my wife...

731
00:45:50,642 --> 00:45:52,303
remarry so obviously beneath her.

732
00:45:54,813 --> 00:45:58,146
How dare you, in this day and age,
use such an idiotic...

733
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:01,380
I'm talking about the difference
in mind and spirit.

734
00:46:01,453 --> 00:46:04,217
You could marry Mac,
the night watchman. I'd cheer for you.

735
00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:07,019
- Kittredge is not for you.
- You bet he's for me.

736
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:09,356
He's a great man and a good man.

737
00:46:09,428 --> 00:46:12,124
Already he's
of national importance.

738
00:46:12,197 --> 00:46:14,722
You sound like Spy magazine talking.

739
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,496
But whatever he is, toots,
you'll have to stick.

740
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:20,766
- He'll give you no out as I did.
- I won't require one.

741
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:27,375
I suppose you'd still be attractive
to any man of spirit, though.

742
00:46:27,446 --> 00:46:30,438
There's something engaging about it,
this "goddess" business...

743
00:46:30,515 --> 00:46:34,007
something more challenging to the male
than the more obvious charms.

744
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:36,145
- Really?
- Really.

745
00:46:36,221 --> 00:46:38,155
We're very vain, you know.

746
00:46:38,223 --> 00:46:41,681
"This citadel can and shall be taken,
and I'm the boy to do it."

747
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:46,724
You seem quite contemptuous of me
all of a sudden.

748
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,368
No, Red, not of you.

749
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:51,732
Never of you.

750
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:58,903
Red, you could be the finest woman
on this earth.

751
00:46:58,977 --> 00:47:02,538
I'm contemptuous of something inside you
you either can't help or won't try to.

752
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:04,445
Your so-called "strength"...

753
00:47:04,516 --> 00:47:07,417
your prejudice against weakness,
your blank intolerance.

754
00:47:07,486 --> 00:47:09,977
- Is that all?
- That's the gist of it.

755
00:47:10,055 --> 00:47:13,991
Because you'll never be a first-class
human being or a first-class woman...

756
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:16,425
until you've learned to have
regard for human frailty.

757
00:47:17,896 --> 00:47:20,831
It's a pity your own foot
can't slip a little sometime...

758
00:47:20,899 --> 00:47:23,231
but your sense of inner divinity
wouldn't allow that.

759
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:26,430
This goddess must
and shall remain intact.

760
00:47:28,674 --> 00:47:30,767
There are more of you
than people realize.

761
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:33,834
A special class of the American female.
"The Married Maidens."

762
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:35,846
So help me,
if you say another word...

763
00:47:35,914 --> 00:47:38,144
I'm through, Red.
For the moment I've had my say.

764
00:47:39,017 --> 00:47:41,611
I suppose I should object
to this twosome.

765
00:47:41,687 --> 00:47:43,621
That would be most objectionable.

766
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:48,792
Any time either of you
want my advice...

767
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,192
- We'll give you a ring.
- Thanks. Do that, will you?

768
00:47:56,635 --> 00:47:58,603
So long, Red.

769
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:03,004
I left you a wedding present. Sorry I
hadn't ribbon to tie it up with.

770
00:48:27,265 --> 00:48:28,960
Aren't you swimming?

771
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:31,298
We haven't time.
Uncle Willie wants us at 8:00.

772
00:48:34,673 --> 00:48:37,301
Look what your friend
considers a wedding present.

773
00:48:39,411 --> 00:48:42,380
- Why, it's a model of the True Love.
- The what?

774
00:48:43,515 --> 00:48:46,484
A boat he designed
and built, practically.

775
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:50,578
We sailed it down the coast of Maine
and back the summer we were married.

776
00:48:50,655 --> 00:48:52,020
My, she was yare!

777
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,557
"Yare"? What's that mean?

778
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,822
It means, uh...
Oh, what does it mean?

779
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:00,921
Easy to handle, quick to the helm.
Fast, bright.

780
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:04,135
Everything a boat should be...

781
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:06,136
until she develops dry rot.

782
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:16,877
Oh, George, to get away.

783
00:49:16,948 --> 00:49:19,212
Somehow to be useful
in the world.

784
00:49:19,284 --> 00:49:21,149
Useful? You, Tracy?

785
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:24,245
I'm gonna build you an ivory tower
with my own two hands.

786
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,017
Like fun you are.

787
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:29,890
You mean you've
been in one too long?

788
00:49:29,961 --> 00:49:34,557
Well, I mean that
and a lot of things.

789
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:47,677
You know, we're gonna
represent something, Tracy...

790
00:49:47,746 --> 00:49:50,180
you and I and our home.

791
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:53,479
Something straight, sound and fine.

792
00:49:53,552 --> 00:49:56,919
Then perhaps Mr. Haven will be
somewhat less condescending.

793
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:06,022
You don't really mind him, do you?

794
00:50:07,165 --> 00:50:09,133
I mean the fact of him?

795
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:11,135
"Fact of him"?
What do you mean?

796
00:50:11,203 --> 00:50:13,262
I mean...
Well, you know.

797
00:50:13,338 --> 00:50:15,806
That he ever was
my lord and master.

798
00:50:15,874 --> 00:50:17,307
That we ever were...

799
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,570
I don't believe
he ever was, Tracy.

800
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:20,736
Not really.

801
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:24,248
I don't believe that anyone ever was
or ever will be.

802
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:27,046
That's the wonderful thing
about you, Tracy.

803
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,484
What? How?

804
00:50:28,553 --> 00:50:32,956
You're like some marvelous, distant,
well, queen, I guess.

805
00:50:33,024 --> 00:50:36,687
You're so cool and fine
and always so much your own.

806
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:40,060
There's a kind of beautiful purity
about you, Tracy, like a statue.

807
00:50:40,132 --> 00:50:42,066
- George...
- It's grand, Tracy.

808
00:50:42,134 --> 00:50:44,364
It's what everybody
feels about you.

809
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:46,631
It's what I first
worshipped you for from afar.

810
00:50:46,705 --> 00:50:49,640
- George, listen.
- First, now and always.

811
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:53,641
Only from a little nearer now,
eh, darling?

812
00:50:53,712 --> 00:50:58,308
L... I don't want to be worshipped.
I want to be loved.

813
00:50:58,383 --> 00:51:01,477
Well, you're that too, Tracy.
You're that, all right.

814
00:51:01,553 --> 00:51:04,420
I mean really loved.

815
00:51:04,489 --> 00:51:07,322
But that goes
without saying, Tracy.

816
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:11,624
No. No, now it's you
who doesn't see what I mean.

817
00:51:16,301 --> 00:51:18,735
I'd better get dressed.
I hate to be late.

818
00:51:26,036 --> 00:51:29,301
Oh, nothing. Run along.
I'll be dressed when you get back.

819
00:52:11,515 --> 00:52:13,949
You're Uncle Willie's guest of honor.
You mustn't be late.

820
00:52:14,018 --> 00:52:16,885
That fiancé of yours roared
out of here on two wheels.

821
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:19,184
Does he, by any chance,
ever walk anywhere?

822
00:52:19,256 --> 00:52:21,315
When he likes, I expect.

823
00:52:21,392 --> 00:52:24,623
I have a feeling he'll take that ring
tomorrow and go through center with it.

824
00:52:24,695 --> 00:52:26,322
Seth, you idiot!

825
00:52:28,165 --> 00:52:30,258
Very amusing, I'm sure.

826
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:33,497
Almost as amusing as the sight of you
with your arm around Mother.

827
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:37,129
I find very unamusing...

828
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:39,836
the stupid, undignified spectacle
we're making of ourselves...

829
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,310
for the benefit
of those two newspaper people.

830
00:52:42,379 --> 00:52:43,846
Whose fault is it?

831
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:47,247
That's not the point. They can publish
anything they like about me...

832
00:52:47,318 --> 00:52:49,878
but I insist that we inform Connor
and the camera lady...

833
00:52:49,954 --> 00:52:52,354
that we're all aware
of their purpose here.

834
00:52:52,423 --> 00:52:54,687
All right.
I'll tell them myself.

835
00:52:55,926 --> 00:53:00,329
It'd look better coming from me
as the titular head of the family.

836
00:53:00,397 --> 00:53:03,059
Of course, inasmuch as you've
let us in for it in the first place!

837
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:05,897
Keep that note out of your voice.
It's very unattractive.

838
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:10,498
Oh? How does your dancer friend talk,
or does she purr?

839
00:53:10,574 --> 00:53:12,166
- Tracy!
- It's quite all right.

840
00:53:12,243 --> 00:53:15,440
Sweet and low, I suppose.
Dulcet. Very ladylike.

841
00:53:15,512 --> 00:53:18,447
You've got nerve to come back here in
your best head-of-the-family manner...

842
00:53:18,515 --> 00:53:22,349
and make stands and strike attitudes
and criticize my fiancé...

843
00:53:22,419 --> 00:53:24,478
and give orders
and mess things up generally.

844
00:53:24,555 --> 00:53:26,853
- Stop it instantly!
- I can't help it! It's sickening!

845
00:53:26,924 --> 00:53:30,690
- As if he'd done nothing at all.
- Which happens to be the truth.

846
00:53:30,761 --> 00:53:33,696
Anyway, it's not your affair.
If it concerns anyone...

847
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:37,893
Well, actually, I don't know
who it concerns except your father.

848
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:42,030
That's very wise of you, Margaret.

849
00:53:42,106 --> 00:53:45,269
What most wives fail to realize is that
their husbands' philandering...

850
00:53:45,342 --> 00:53:47,606
has nothing whatever
to do with them.

851
00:53:47,678 --> 00:53:50,841
Oh? Then what has it to do with?

852
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:54,943
A reluctance to grow old, I think.

853
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:58,250
I suppose the best mainstay a man
can have as he gets along in years...

854
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:00,313
is a daughter.

855
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:02,325
The right kind of daughter.

856
00:54:02,393 --> 00:54:03,985
How sweet.

857
00:54:04,061 --> 00:54:06,928
No, I'm talking seriously about
something I've thought over thoroughly.

858
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:08,294
I've had to.

859
00:54:08,365 --> 00:54:10,526
A devoted young girl
gives a man the illusion...

860
00:54:10,601 --> 00:54:12,569
that youth is still his.

861
00:54:12,636 --> 00:54:15,434
- Very important, I suppose.
- Oh, very, very.

862
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:18,964
Because, without her, he might be
inclined to go in search of his youth.

863
00:54:19,043 --> 00:54:22,672
That's just as important to him
as it is to any woman.

864
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:25,613
But with a girl of his own,
full of warmth for him...

865
00:54:25,683 --> 00:54:28,379
full of foolish, unquestioning,
uncritical affection...

866
00:54:28,452 --> 00:54:31,114
- None of which I've got.
- None.

867
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:33,554
You have a good mind,
a pretty face...

868
00:54:33,624 --> 00:54:35,888
a disciplined body that does
what you tell it.

869
00:54:35,959 --> 00:54:39,918
You have everything it takes to make
a lovely woman except the one essential.

870
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:42,488
An understanding heart.

871
00:54:42,566 --> 00:54:45,296
Without that, you might as well
be made of bronze.

872
00:54:48,339 --> 00:54:51,672
That's an awful thing
to say to anyone.

873
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,778
Yes, it is indeed.

874
00:54:57,181 --> 00:55:00,378
So I'm to blame
for Tina Mara, am I?

875
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:03,318
- To a certain extent, I expect you are.
- You coward!

876
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:08,654
But better that than a prig
or a perennial spinster...

877
00:55:08,726 --> 00:55:10,523
however many marriages.

878
00:55:10,594 --> 00:55:12,789
- Seth, that's too much.
- I'm afraid it's not enough.

879
00:55:12,863 --> 00:55:14,660
I'm afraid nothing is.

880
00:55:14,732 --> 00:55:18,896
- What did you say I was?
- Do you want me to repeat it?

881
00:55:21,805 --> 00:55:23,739
A prig and a...

882
00:55:25,476 --> 00:55:28,934
You mean you think I think I'm some kind
of a goddess or something?

883
00:55:29,012 --> 00:55:32,209
If your ego
wants it that way, yes.

884
00:55:32,282 --> 00:55:34,944
Also, you've been talking
like a jealous woman.

885
00:55:40,023 --> 00:55:43,049
What's the matter with everyone
all at once, anyhow?

886
00:55:44,294 --> 00:55:47,661
I've been asleep.
What time is it?

887
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:49,892
- After 7:00.
- Call my house.

888
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:52,060
Tell them I'm on my way.
You'd better come along too.

889
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:55,162
You're the host tonight,
you know? Uncle Willie.

890
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:57,901
That's all over.
You're yourself again. So am I.

891
00:55:57,975 --> 00:56:00,603
- You've told them?
- I shall at the first opportunity.

892
00:56:02,513 --> 00:56:04,777
My first party, and about time.

893
00:56:04,848 --> 00:56:06,782
- Can I have a cocktail?
- Certainly not!

894
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:10,251
- It's a dirty gyp.
- That dress hikes up a little behind.

895
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,016
- No, it's me that does.
- You look adorable, Dinah.

896
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:15,354
Oh, thanks, Tracy.
Thanks ever so much.

897
00:56:15,426 --> 00:56:17,155
Tracy, you must dress.

898
00:56:17,227 --> 00:56:20,287
Let's all have a last drink.
I'm sorry. I forgot. You never drink.

899
00:56:20,364 --> 00:56:22,161
- Prigs don't.
- What's that?

900
00:56:22,232 --> 00:56:24,564
- Nor spinsters.
- Again, please?

901
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:26,728
Nor goddesses of any variety.

902
00:56:27,871 --> 00:56:30,897
Not completely.
Just a borderline case.

903
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:33,442
Miss Imbrie and I
have something on our minds.

904
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,671
Splendid.
Just the place for it. What?

905
00:56:35,746 --> 00:56:39,773
- We'd like to say something.
- I'm all ears and eyes.

906
00:56:41,685 --> 00:56:44,245
You're a vision of loveliness,
Miss Imbrie.

907
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,255
Will you have a cocktail
or champagne?

908
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:48,757
Oh, champagne.
I've never had enough.

909
00:56:48,826 --> 00:56:50,453
You will, tonight.

910
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:56,598
- I'd like to say...
- I have something to say first.

911
00:56:56,667 --> 00:57:00,159
- I am Seth Lord.
- No!

912
00:57:00,237 --> 00:57:03,638
- Then that makes you...
- Available.

913
00:57:03,707 --> 00:57:05,732
And you are Miss Imbrie
of Spy magazine.

914
00:57:06,877 --> 00:57:08,936
- Now you know.
- I was going to tell you...

915
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:12,504
- As to the reasons...
- Not now. We ought to be early.

916
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:16,019
And who'll go with me
in my little car?

917
00:57:16,086 --> 00:57:20,182
Dinah and I. Seth, will you take
Miss Imbrie and Mr. O'Connor? Dinah?

918
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,987
I can tell there's something in the air,
because I'm being taken away.

919
00:57:27,498 --> 00:57:29,989
Well, I'll see you all later.

920
00:57:31,068 --> 00:57:33,593
Don't do that.
What's the matter?

921
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,069
Nothing.

922
00:57:35,138 --> 00:57:36,571
Miss Imbrie?

923
00:57:38,609 --> 00:57:41,942
You know, I felt exactly
as though I'd been pinched.

924
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:43,946
Don't you think you weren't.

925
00:57:50,454 --> 00:57:52,046
You aren't even dressed.

926
00:57:52,122 --> 00:57:54,522
Um, you go ahead.

927
00:57:54,591 --> 00:57:57,924
I'll, uh,
follow along with George.

928
00:57:57,995 --> 00:57:59,929
What's the matter with Tracy?

929
00:58:00,797 --> 00:58:02,731
You tell me, will you?

930
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:06,064
Darned if I know.
I'd like to.

931
00:58:06,136 --> 00:58:10,334
Well, Macaulay,
if you ever happen to find out...

932
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:12,773
I'll tell you. Sure.

933
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:15,403
And remember, Mike:

934
00:58:15,479 --> 00:58:18,642
- "With the rich and mighty"...
- "Always a little patience"?

935
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:15,771
Do you know what time it is?

936
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,704
It's after 4:00.

937
00:59:17,774 --> 00:59:20,766
In China it's later than that.

938
00:59:20,844 --> 00:59:23,312
In China we'd be married by now.

939
00:59:25,082 --> 00:59:27,482
Or perhaps it's only yesterday.

940
00:59:27,551 --> 00:59:29,485
I'm going home after this dance.

941
00:59:29,553 --> 00:59:31,544
There was a Chinese poet
who was drowned...

942
00:59:31,622 --> 00:59:34,420
while trying to kiss
the moon in the river.

943
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:37,358
- He was drunk.
- I'd say as much.

944
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:39,088
But he wrote beautiful poetry.

945
00:59:54,645 --> 00:59:58,046
Macaulay Connor of South Bend
reporting for duty.

946
00:59:58,115 --> 01:00:00,208
I'm sorry, we're going home
after this dance.

947
01:00:00,283 --> 01:00:03,309
You can't do that to me,
not a friend of old Junius.

948
01:00:03,387 --> 01:00:07,084
- I mean, not an old friend of Junius.
- I wish old Junius were here.

949
01:00:07,157 --> 01:00:09,125
Tracy, I'll get your wraps.

950
01:00:09,192 --> 01:00:10,853
He'll wrap me up.

951
01:00:10,927 --> 01:00:12,360
- Hello, you.
- Hello.

952
01:00:12,429 --> 01:00:14,795
- You look fine.
- I feel fine.

953
01:00:14,865 --> 01:00:16,560
Good, good.

954
01:00:18,235 --> 01:00:20,863
Oh, wait a minute.
What was I saying?

955
01:00:20,937 --> 01:00:23,906
Oh. Let's have another drink,
or would Kittredge spank?

956
01:00:23,974 --> 01:00:27,501
- That's not what you were saying.
- It isn't? All right.

957
01:00:27,577 --> 01:00:29,807
Not what I was saying.

958
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,541
Oh, oh, I know.

959
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:35,107
Why do you wish your brother was here?
Does he like Kittredge?

960
01:00:35,185 --> 01:00:38,348
- Everybody likes Kittredge.
- Everybody likes Kittredge.

961
01:00:38,422 --> 01:00:41,914
Everybody except
C.K. Dexter Haven, huh?

962
01:00:44,161 --> 01:00:47,289
- Come on. We'll have some wine.
- Some wine.

963
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:53,534
Mother, I thought you'd
gone home ages ago.

964
01:00:53,603 --> 01:00:56,367
I should have, but I've been
having such a good time.

965
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,001
- Everybody should have a good time.
- Darling, what's come over you?

966
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:02,671
Oh, it's just that
a lot of things...

967
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:05,544
I always thought were
terribly important...

968
01:01:05,615 --> 01:01:10,018
I find now are...
and the other way around and...

969
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:12,453
Oh, what the dickens.

970
01:01:12,522 --> 01:01:15,320
Connor, you're thirsty,
and the night is young.

971
01:01:16,493 --> 01:01:19,053
- Here we are, dear.
- We're going to have one more drink...

972
01:01:19,129 --> 01:01:22,462
- Not you, I'm afraid.
- Why should you be afraid?

973
01:01:22,532 --> 01:01:25,262
- You know wine never affects me.
- Look here...

974
01:01:25,335 --> 01:01:28,862
What she really wants, George,
is another dance with you.

975
01:01:28,939 --> 01:01:31,908
- Oh, very well.
- If it's that much of a chore...

976
01:01:31,975 --> 01:01:34,637
- Not for me!
- You've already been too attentive!

977
01:01:34,711 --> 01:01:36,542
George, please.

978
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:38,740
What will the neighbors think?

979
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:45,381
- The course of true love.
- Gathers no moss.

980
01:01:54,131 --> 01:01:56,565
Boy, champagne.

981
01:01:58,068 --> 01:02:01,367
Just the bottle.
I'm going on a picnic.

982
01:02:04,741 --> 01:02:08,108
- You're leaving us, Jock?
- Rather, but I'll be back.

983
01:02:08,178 --> 01:02:10,373
Come on, darling, champagne!

984
01:02:10,447 --> 01:02:12,506
And again and again and again!

985
01:02:19,923 --> 01:02:21,720
Follow that cab!

986
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:23,953
- What cab, sir?
- No cab.

987
01:02:24,027 --> 01:02:28,088
Some joke, huh? Take me to
the C.K. Dexter Haven mansion.

988
01:02:28,165 --> 01:02:30,759
- Mr. Haven?
- Front entrance.

989
01:02:36,973 --> 01:02:38,838
C.K. Dexter Haven!

990
01:02:43,613 --> 01:02:45,547
This is where
Cinderella gets off.

991
01:02:45,615 --> 01:02:49,949
You hurry back to the ball before you
turn into a pumpkin and six white mice.

992
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,181
Good-bye.
C.K. Dexter Haven.

993
01:02:56,259 --> 01:02:58,887
- What's up?
- You are.

994
01:02:58,962 --> 01:03:00,896
I hope it's worth it.
Come on in.

995
01:03:00,964 --> 01:03:03,125
I bring you greetings.

996
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,533
Cinderella's slipper.
It's called champagne.

997
01:03:06,603 --> 01:03:09,766
Champagne is a great "levelerer."
Leveler.

998
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,071
- It makes you my equal.
- I wouldn't quite say that.

999
01:03:13,143 --> 01:03:15,543
Well, almost my equal.

1000
01:03:15,612 --> 01:03:18,547
C.K. Dexter Haven,
I would like to talk to you.

1001
01:03:18,615 --> 01:03:20,981
Let's go in the talking room.

1002
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:28,346
- Don't tell me the party's over so soon.
- No, no.

1003
01:03:28,425 --> 01:03:31,792
- I just felt like talking to you.
- Well, that's nice.

1004
01:03:41,004 --> 01:03:43,302
I wonder if I might
borrow a drink.

1005
01:03:43,373 --> 01:03:45,898
Certainly.
Coals to Newcastle.

1006
01:03:45,976 --> 01:03:47,910
Here, sit down.

1007
01:03:59,623 --> 01:04:00,817
Excuse me.

1008
01:04:13,169 --> 01:04:14,693
What's this?

1009
01:04:16,206 --> 01:04:17,867
- Is it my book?
- Yes.

1010
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:20,842
C.K. Dexter Haven,
you have unsuspected depth.

1011
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:23,971
- Thanks, old chap.
- But have you read it?

1012
01:04:24,047 --> 01:04:26,709
I was trying to stop drinking.
I read anything.

1013
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:30,480
- And did you stop drinking?
- Yes. Your book didn't do it, though.

1014
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,317
Are you still in love with her?

1015
01:04:36,393 --> 01:04:39,829
Or perhaps you'd consider that
a very personal question.

1016
01:04:39,896 --> 01:04:42,626
- Not at all.
- Liz thinks you are!

1017
01:04:42,699 --> 01:04:44,064
Liz thinks you are.

1018
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:47,831
But of course, women like to romanti...
romanticize about things.

1019
01:04:47,904 --> 01:04:51,203
- Yes, they do, don't they?
- Yes, they do, don't they?

1020
01:04:51,274 --> 01:04:54,471
I can't understand how you
could've been married to her...

1021
01:04:54,544 --> 01:04:56,478
and still know
so little about her.

1022
01:04:56,546 --> 01:04:58,480
- Can't you?
- No, I can't you.

1023
01:05:00,517 --> 01:05:03,975
I have the hiccups. I wonder
if I might have another drink?

1024
01:05:04,054 --> 01:05:05,988
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

1025
01:05:13,129 --> 01:05:15,495
You know, Tracy's
no ordinary woman...

1026
01:05:15,565 --> 01:05:18,500
and you said some things to her
this afternoon I resented.

1027
01:05:18,568 --> 01:05:21,401
- I apologize, Mr. Connor.
- That's quite all right.

1028
01:05:21,471 --> 01:05:25,840
But when a girl is like Tracy,
she's one in a million. She's...

1029
01:05:25,909 --> 01:05:28,605
She's sort of like a...
She's sort of like a...

1030
01:05:28,678 --> 01:05:30,543
- A goddess?
- No, no, no!

1031
01:05:30,613 --> 01:05:33,912
You said that word
this afternoon. No.

1032
01:05:36,252 --> 01:05:38,550
She's sort of like a queen...

1033
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:43,453
a radiant, glorious queen...

1034
01:05:44,794 --> 01:05:47,262
and you can't treat her
like other women.

1035
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:51,664
No, I suppose not. But then, I imagine
Kittredge appreciates all that.

1036
01:05:51,735 --> 01:05:54,670
Kittredge!
Kittredge appreciates Kittredge!

1037
01:05:54,738 --> 01:05:58,003
Ah, that fake "man of the people."
He isn't even smart.

1038
01:05:58,074 --> 01:06:00,907
He's a five-cent edition
of Sidney Kidd.

1039
01:06:02,312 --> 01:06:05,839
Well, I always thought Kidd himself
was the five-cent kid.

1040
01:06:05,915 --> 01:06:09,316
And what's that make you worth,
C.K. Dexter Haven...

1041
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:11,411
bringing us down here?

1042
01:06:11,488 --> 01:06:15,549
But you know why I did that.
To get even with my ex-bride.

1043
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,923
Doggone it, C.K. Dexter Haven...

1044
01:06:17,994 --> 01:06:21,191
either I'm gonna sock you
or you're gonna sock me!

1045
01:06:21,264 --> 01:06:23,255
Shall we toss a coin?

1046
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:28,762
Kidd's just using you
like he uses everybody else.

1047
01:06:30,573 --> 01:06:33,371
You don't know Kidd
like I know him.

1048
01:06:33,443 --> 01:06:38,437
The guy's colossal. He's terrific.
He's got everybody fooled.

1049
01:06:38,515 --> 01:06:40,881
Yes.

1050
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:45,410
"No mean Machiavelli
is smiling, cynical Sidney Kidd.

1051
01:06:45,488 --> 01:06:48,548
"The world's his oyster
with an 'R' in every month."

1052
01:06:49,626 --> 01:06:51,594
That's not bad.
When did I say that?

1053
01:06:51,661 --> 01:06:53,219
You didn't. I did.
Sorry.

1054
01:06:53,296 --> 01:06:56,265
I suppose you never heard about
Kidd's arrangement in Kansas City?

1055
01:06:56,332 --> 01:06:57,822
- No.
- In San Francisco?

1056
01:06:57,901 --> 01:07:00,267
Let me tell you about
the time he went to Boston...

1057
01:07:00,336 --> 01:07:03,669
to be awarded the Sarah Langley
Medal for World Peace.

1058
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,903
The true story on that
little jaunt would ruin him.

1059
01:07:11,514 --> 01:07:14,711
Look, Connor. What would happen
to you if I used this stuff?

1060
01:07:14,784 --> 01:07:17,412
- Why?
- I might want to, very much.

1061
01:07:17,487 --> 01:07:20,285
Kidd is holding a dirty piece
on Tracy's father.

1062
01:07:20,356 --> 01:07:22,916
- This might stop him.
- On Tracy's father?

1063
01:07:22,992 --> 01:07:24,983
That's right.

1064
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:29,495
Oh, so that's how
Kidd got you to...

1065
01:07:29,566 --> 01:07:32,694
That's how Liz and I were gotten in.
Blackmail, huh?

1066
01:07:32,769 --> 01:07:35,294
We all rode into this thing
on a filthy blackmail.

1067
01:07:35,371 --> 01:07:38,465
Look, you use it.
Use it with my blessings.

1068
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:41,999
I'm through anyway. I'm not gonna
hand in a story on this wedding.

1069
01:07:42,078 --> 01:07:45,514
- I'm gonna write one on Kidd.
- No, let me do it.

1070
01:07:45,582 --> 01:07:47,846
I don't have to tell him
where I got my facts. Okay?

1071
01:07:47,917 --> 01:07:50,613
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

1072
01:07:53,189 --> 01:07:55,316
Now shoot.

1073
01:07:55,391 --> 01:07:57,325
Peace medal. Boston.

1074
01:07:57,393 --> 01:08:00,556
Oh, oh.
The time: May, 1938.

1075
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:03,690
The place:
Boston, in a hotel.

1076
01:08:03,766 --> 01:08:05,495
Kidd had just arrived.

1077
01:08:05,568 --> 01:08:08,935
And this same Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen of America...

1078
01:08:09,005 --> 01:08:12,771
this protector of American democracy
and homes and firesides...

1079
01:08:12,842 --> 01:08:15,174
was at that very moment
entertaining...

1080
01:08:15,245 --> 01:08:18,305
the South Carolina Mata Hari
on his yacht.

1081
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:20,474
Don't interrupt me!

1082
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:23,144
This Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen...

1083
01:08:23,219 --> 01:08:25,881
who demanded the respect...

1084
01:08:25,955 --> 01:08:28,389
of all who were
connected with him...

1085
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:31,291
- We've come for the body of Macaulay.
- I'm glad you came.

1086
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:34,694
- Can you use a typewriter?
- No, thanks. I have one at home.

1087
01:08:36,766 --> 01:08:37,698
Who's that?

1088
01:08:37,767 --> 01:08:41,032
Here was Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen...

1089
01:08:41,104 --> 01:08:43,698
Sidney Kidd the good,
Sidney Kidd the noble...

1090
01:08:43,773 --> 01:08:45,536
Where's Kittredge?

1091
01:08:45,608 --> 01:08:47,200
- The people's choice?
- Yeah.

1092
01:08:47,277 --> 01:08:50,769
His bride just dropped him at
the gatehouse after a slight explosion.

1093
01:08:50,847 --> 01:08:52,109
A fight?

1094
01:08:52,182 --> 01:08:54,582
Fifteen rounds, no decision.

1095
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:56,983
Where's my wandering parakeet?

1096
01:09:15,338 --> 01:09:17,272
You look beautiful, Red.

1097
01:09:22,145 --> 01:09:23,737
Come on in.

1098
01:09:25,782 --> 01:09:27,716
Why?

1099
01:09:27,784 --> 01:09:30,275
No particular reason.
A drink, maybe?

1100
01:09:32,388 --> 01:09:34,356
I don't drink.

1101
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:36,585
That's right. I forgot.

1102
01:09:38,962 --> 01:09:40,554
I haven't.

1103
01:09:45,635 --> 01:09:48,160
Show Liz to a typewriter
and stand back.

1104
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,365
- Can she do it?
- She can and she will.

1105
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,432
- Dictate to her and then bring her home.
- Aren't you coming, Liz?

1106
01:09:53,509 --> 01:09:55,943
It seems I've got to
commit suicide first.

1107
01:09:56,012 --> 01:09:58,207
- Going my way, Miss?
- Miss Goddess to you.

1108
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:00,476
Okay, Miss Goddess to me.

1109
01:10:37,186 --> 01:10:40,986
Champagne's funny stuff.
I'm used to whiskey.

1110
01:10:41,057 --> 01:10:44,515
Whiskey's a slap on the back,
and champagne's...

1111
01:10:44,594 --> 01:10:47,222
heavy mist before my eyes.

1112
01:10:49,532 --> 01:10:51,898
Do you hear a telephone ringing?

1113
01:10:51,968 --> 01:10:54,459
I did a little while ago.
Let's see.

1114
01:10:56,906 --> 01:10:58,498
No, not yet.

1115
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:03,770
Now I do, far away.

1116
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:09,311
It's my bedroom telephone.

1117
01:11:11,254 --> 01:11:13,950
It couldn't be anyone but George.

1118
01:11:14,023 --> 01:11:16,583
I was sort of swinish to him.

1119
01:11:16,659 --> 01:11:19,423
Perhaps I'd better go
and see what...

1120
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:28,637
It isn't ringing anymore.

1121
01:11:30,406 --> 01:11:32,033
I tell you what.

1122
01:11:32,108 --> 01:11:34,474
Let's have a quick swim
to brighten us up.

1123
01:11:34,544 --> 01:11:36,535
Dexter and I always
swam after parties.

1124
01:11:36,612 --> 01:11:38,978
Let's dip into this instead, huh?

1125
01:11:43,286 --> 01:11:46,050
- Hello, you.
- Hello.

1126
01:11:46,122 --> 01:11:48,556
- You look fine.
- I feel fine.

1127
01:11:49,559 --> 01:11:51,493
Did you enjoy the party?

1128
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:54,029
Sure. Sure.

1129
01:11:54,097 --> 01:11:56,964
The prettiest sight
in this fine, pretty world...

1130
01:11:57,033 --> 01:12:00,935
is the privileged class
enjoying its privileges.

1131
01:12:01,003 --> 01:12:04,530
- You're a snob, Connor.
- No doubt. No doubt.

1132
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,700
"Awash with champagne...

1133
01:12:06,776 --> 01:12:09,609
"was Will Q. Tracy's
pleasure dome...

1134
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,547
"on the nuptial eve
of Tracy Samantha... Tracy..."

1135
01:12:18,621 --> 01:12:21,112
You can't marry that guy.

1136
01:12:21,991 --> 01:12:25,483
George? I'm going to.

1137
01:12:25,561 --> 01:12:27,358
- Why not?
- I don't know.

1138
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:30,524
I thought I'd be for it at first,
but you don't seem to match up.

1139
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,192
Then the fault's with me.

1140
01:12:32,268 --> 01:12:34,566
Maybe so. But all the same,
you can't do it.

1141
01:12:35,938 --> 01:12:38,634
Come around about noon tomorrow.

1142
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:40,642
I mean today.

1143
01:12:42,211 --> 01:12:45,112
- Snob.
- What do you mean, "snob"?

1144
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:49,948
You're the worst kind there is,
an intellectual snob.

1145
01:12:50,019 --> 01:12:53,147
You made up your mind
awfully young, it seems to me.

1146
01:12:53,222 --> 01:12:55,452
Thirty's about time
to make up your mind.

1147
01:12:55,525 --> 01:12:57,720
And I'm nothing of the sort.
Not Mr. Connor.

1148
01:12:57,794 --> 01:13:01,787
The time to make up
your mind about people...

1149
01:13:01,864 --> 01:13:03,456
is never.

1150
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,492
Yes, you are,
and a complete one.

1151
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,834
- You're quite a girl, aren't you?
- You think?

1152
01:13:09,906 --> 01:13:12,932
- Yeah, I know.
- I don't think I'm exceptional.

1153
01:13:13,009 --> 01:13:16,376
- You are, though.
- I know any number like me.

1154
01:13:16,446 --> 01:13:18,710
You oughta get around more.

1155
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:23,411
What, in the upper class?

1156
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:25,886
No, no.
No, thank you.

1157
01:13:25,955 --> 01:13:30,119
You're just a mass
of prejudices, aren't you?

1158
01:13:30,193 --> 01:13:33,822
You're so much thought
and so little feeling, Professor.

1159
01:13:33,896 --> 01:13:37,059
- I am, am I?
- Yes, you am, are you.

1160
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:40,830
Your intolerance infuriates me!

1161
01:13:40,903 --> 01:13:44,168
I should think that, of all people,
a writer would need tolerance.

1162
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,175
That fact is you'll never,
you can't be...

1163
01:13:47,243 --> 01:13:49,768
a first-rate writer
or a first-rate human being...

1164
01:13:49,846 --> 01:13:53,839
until you've learned to have
some small regard for human fra...

1165
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:02,553
Aren't the geraniums
pretty, Professor?

1166
01:14:04,494 --> 01:14:07,327
Is it not a handsome day...

1167
01:14:07,396 --> 01:14:10,229
that begins, Professor?

1168
01:14:10,299 --> 01:14:12,824
- Lay off that "Professor."
- Yes, Professor.

1169
01:14:12,902 --> 01:14:15,564
You've got all the arrogance
of your class, all right.

1170
01:14:15,638 --> 01:14:18,436
How... what have classes
to do with it?

1171
01:14:18,508 --> 01:14:20,703
What do they matter
except for the people in them?

1172
01:14:20,776 --> 01:14:25,008
George comes from the so-called lower
class; Dexter from the upper. Well?

1173
01:14:25,081 --> 01:14:29,142
Mac, the night watchman, is a prince
among men; Uncle Willie is a pincher.

1174
01:14:30,786 --> 01:14:33,846
Upper and lower, my eye.
I'll take the lower, thanks.

1175
01:14:33,923 --> 01:14:35,652
If you can't get a drawing room.

1176
01:14:35,725 --> 01:14:37,659
- What do you mean by that?
- My mistake.

1177
01:14:37,727 --> 01:14:39,695
- You're insulting!
- I'm sorry.

1178
01:14:39,762 --> 01:14:43,391
- Oh, don't apologize!
- Who's apologizing?

1179
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,061
I never knew such a man.

1180
01:14:46,135 --> 01:14:48,535
You wouldn't be likely to,
not from where you sit.

1181
01:14:48,604 --> 01:14:50,765
Talk about arrogance.

1182
01:14:51,841 --> 01:14:54,275
- Tracy.
- What do you want?

1183
01:14:55,611 --> 01:14:57,670
You're wonderful.

1184
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:03,279
There's a magnificence
in you, Tracy.

1185
01:15:06,088 --> 01:15:09,057
Now I'm getting self-conscious.

1186
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:11,320
It's funny, I...

1187
01:15:16,165 --> 01:15:17,257
Yeah?

1188
01:15:19,869 --> 01:15:23,032
I don't know.
Go up, I guess. It's late.

1189
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,303
A magnificence that comes out
of your eyes and your voice...

1190
01:15:28,377 --> 01:15:31,312
in the way you stand there,
in the way you walk.

1191
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:33,405
You're lit from within, Tracy.

1192
01:15:33,482 --> 01:15:36,815
You've got fires
banked down in you...

1193
01:15:36,886 --> 01:15:40,515
hearth fires and holocausts!

1194
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,794
I don't seem to you
made of bronze?

1195
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:51,529
No. You're made out
of flesh and blood.

1196
01:15:51,601 --> 01:15:54,593
That's the blank,
unholy surprise of it.

1197
01:15:55,671 --> 01:15:58,538
You're the golden girl, Tracy...

1198
01:15:58,608 --> 01:16:02,203
full of life and warmth
and delight.

1199
01:16:04,447 --> 01:16:07,883
What goes on?
You got tears in your eyes.

1200
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,815
Shut up. Shut up.

1201
01:16:09,885 --> 01:16:12,251
Oh, Mike, keep talking.
Keep talking.

1202
01:16:12,321 --> 01:16:14,255
Talk, will you?

1203
01:16:17,226 --> 01:16:19,786
No, no, I've...

1204
01:16:19,862 --> 01:16:21,523
I've stopped.

1205
01:16:23,099 --> 01:16:24,862
Why?

1206
01:16:24,934 --> 01:16:29,428
Has your mind taken hold again,
dear Professor?

1207
01:16:30,573 --> 01:16:34,009
Well, it's a good thing,
don't you agree?

1208
01:16:34,076 --> 01:16:35,202
No, Professor.

1209
01:16:35,277 --> 01:16:37,404
Lay off that "Professor" stuff!
Do you hear me?

1210
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,243
Yes, Professor.

1211
01:16:42,284 --> 01:16:44,718
- That's all I am to you?
- Of course, Professor.

1212
01:16:44,787 --> 01:16:47,415
- Are you sure?
- Why, yes, of course...

1213
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,793
Golly.

1214
01:16:59,168 --> 01:17:00,601
- Golly Moses!
- Tracy.

1215
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:02,695
- Mr. Connor...
- Let me tell you something.

1216
01:17:02,772 --> 01:17:05,536
- I've got the shakes.
- It can't be anything like love, can it?

1217
01:17:05,608 --> 01:17:07,974
No, no, it mustn't be.
It can't.

1218
01:17:08,044 --> 01:17:11,070
- Would it be inconvenient?
- Terribly.

1219
01:17:11,147 --> 01:17:13,115
Anyway, I know it isn't.

1220
01:17:13,182 --> 01:17:15,616
- Mike, we're out of our minds.
- Right into our hearts.

1221
01:17:15,685 --> 01:17:18,210
- That ought to have music.
- It does, doesn't it?

1222
01:17:18,287 --> 01:17:21,552
It's as if my insteps
were melting away.

1223
01:17:21,624 --> 01:17:24,320
- Have I got feet of clay?
- Tracy.

1224
01:17:24,393 --> 01:17:26,987
It's not far to the pool.
It's in the birch grove.

1225
01:17:27,063 --> 01:17:29,361
- It'll be lovely now.
- Tracy, you're tremendous.

1226
01:17:29,432 --> 01:17:31,423
Put me in your pocket, Mike.

1227
01:17:46,582 --> 01:17:48,982
I can't imagine what
makes me so sleepy.

1228
01:17:49,051 --> 01:17:52,452
- It couldn't be the company.
- It's you, Mr. Dexter.

1229
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:55,081
- Hello, Mac.
- I heard you were about.

1230
01:17:55,157 --> 01:17:58,092
- Any prowlers around?
- No prowlers.

1231
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,789
- Can Miss Imbrie get in this way?
- If she can't, you can go in the back.

1232
01:18:01,864 --> 01:18:03,297
Good.

1233
01:18:06,702 --> 01:18:08,863
- Thanks, Mac. Good night.
- Good night, sir.

1234
01:18:08,938 --> 01:18:13,238
Well, home after
a hard day's blackmailing.

1235
01:18:14,677 --> 01:18:17,339
When are you going
to telephone Kidd?

1236
01:18:17,413 --> 01:18:19,574
In time to get him here
for the wedding.

1237
01:18:19,648 --> 01:18:21,081
Why?

1238
01:18:21,984 --> 01:18:25,385
A sort of wedding present,
if it works.

1239
01:18:26,522 --> 01:18:28,285
If it works.

1240
01:18:29,258 --> 01:18:31,783
I could still tear it up.

1241
01:18:31,861 --> 01:18:36,764
No. Mike's only chance to ever become
a really fine writer is to get fired.

1242
01:18:37,633 --> 01:18:39,624
You're a good number, Liz.

1243
01:18:39,702 --> 01:18:42,432
Oh, I just photograph well.

1244
01:18:43,506 --> 01:18:46,066
I'm certainly out of focus now.

1245
01:18:46,142 --> 01:18:48,235
Why don't you take a swim?

1246
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:50,335
- A swim?
- Sure.

1247
01:18:50,412 --> 01:18:53,506
Tracy and I always
took a swim after a party.

1248
01:18:53,582 --> 01:18:55,675
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

1249
01:18:55,751 --> 01:18:57,446
Bet it was fun.

1250
01:18:58,721 --> 01:19:01,155
I'll have to try it
with Mike sometime.

1251
01:19:02,358 --> 01:19:05,020
Liz, why don't you marry him?

1252
01:19:06,028 --> 01:19:08,223
- You really want to know?
- Mm-hmm.

1253
01:19:09,165 --> 01:19:11,531
He's still got a lot to learn.

1254
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,194
I don't want to get
in his way for a while.

1255
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:20,775
It's risky though, Liz.

1256
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:23,073
Suppose another girl
came along in the meantime?

1257
01:19:23,145 --> 01:19:25,875
I'd scratch her eyes out,
I guess.

1258
01:19:25,948 --> 01:19:29,384
That is, unless she was going to
marry somebody else the next day.

1259
01:19:52,007 --> 01:19:54,441
- Hello, Kittredge.
- What are you doing here?

1260
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:56,774
I'm a friend of the family's.
Dropped in for a chat.

1261
01:19:56,846 --> 01:19:59,406
Don't try to be funny.
I asked you a question.

1262
01:19:59,481 --> 01:20:01,949
I could ask you
the same question.

1263
01:20:02,017 --> 01:20:04,212
I telephoned Tracy,
and her phone didn't answer.

1264
01:20:04,286 --> 01:20:06,516
I was worried,
so I walked over.

1265
01:20:06,589 --> 01:20:09,581
- I was worried too.
- About what?

1266
01:20:09,658 --> 01:20:13,185
What do you think of
this fellow Connor, or do you?

1267
01:20:13,262 --> 01:20:14,854
If you're trying to insinuate...

1268
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:18,161
My dear chap, I wouldn't
insinuate anything, only...

1269
01:20:25,441 --> 01:20:27,375
Kittredge,
I'd advise you to go to bed.

1270
01:20:27,443 --> 01:20:29,775
I don't want your advice.
I'm staying right here.

1271
01:20:29,845 --> 01:20:33,246
You're making a mistake.
Somehow I don't think you'll understand.

1272
01:20:33,315 --> 01:20:37,081
- Maybe you'd better leave that to...
- Dreams really do come true

1273
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,714
Someday I'll wish upon a star

1274
01:20:40,789 --> 01:20:43,417
- What's that?
- It's Mac, the night watchman.

1275
01:20:43,492 --> 01:20:45,551
Always singing.
I'll walk you around the house.

1276
01:20:45,628 --> 01:20:48,722
Something's going on here,
and I'm staying.

1277
01:20:48,797 --> 01:20:50,458
And so are you.

1278
01:20:50,532 --> 01:20:53,262
All right, then.
Take the works.

1279
01:20:53,335 --> 01:20:55,803
Only heaven help you.

1280
01:20:55,871 --> 01:21:00,069
Somewhere over the rainbow

1281
01:21:00,142 --> 01:21:02,508
Way up high

1282
01:21:02,578 --> 01:21:05,570
There's a land
that I heard of

1283
01:21:05,648 --> 01:21:08,446
Once in a lullaby

1284
01:21:14,523 --> 01:21:17,754
And the dreams

1285
01:21:17,826 --> 01:21:20,420
That I dare to dre...

1286
01:21:20,496 --> 01:21:23,021
- Uh-oh.
- Don't stop, Mikey.

1287
01:21:23,098 --> 01:21:24,690
Keep crooning.

1288
01:21:27,503 --> 01:21:32,372
Someday over the rainbow

1289
01:21:32,441 --> 01:21:34,671
Way up high

1290
01:21:34,743 --> 01:21:37,678
- What is this, Connor?
- Easy, old man. She's not hurt?

1291
01:21:37,746 --> 01:21:41,773
- No, no.
- Not wounded, sire, but dead.

1292
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:45,149
Seems the minute she hit the water,
the wine hit her.

1293
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,518
- Look here, Connor.
- A likely story!

1294
01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:50,717
- What'd you say?
- A likely story!

1295
01:21:50,793 --> 01:21:52,727
- If you think that...
- You'll be down directly?

1296
01:21:52,795 --> 01:21:54,592
- Yes, if you want!
- I want.

1297
01:21:55,364 --> 01:21:56,991
Hello, Dexter.

1298
01:21:57,066 --> 01:21:58,931
Hello, George.

1299
01:21:59,902 --> 01:22:01,494
Hello, Mike.

1300
01:22:10,012 --> 01:22:12,503
Second door to the right,
top of the stairs. Don't wake Dinah.

1301
01:22:12,581 --> 01:22:14,981
My feet are made of clay.
Did you know?

1302
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:17,245
Good night, little man.

1303
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,490
How are the mighty fallen.

1304
01:22:26,962 --> 01:22:29,226
If I know Tracy,
and I know her well...

1305
01:22:29,298 --> 01:22:31,459
she'll remember little of this.

1306
01:22:31,533 --> 01:22:34,400
For the second time in her life,
she'll draw quite a tidy blank.

1307
01:22:38,273 --> 01:22:41,106
- You don't believe it, then?
- Believe what?

1308
01:22:41,176 --> 01:22:44,839
Well, the implications of
what you saw, let us say.

1309
01:22:44,913 --> 01:22:48,076
- What else am I to believe?
- That's entirely up to you.

1310
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:51,381
I got eyes, I got imagination,
haven't I?

1311
01:22:51,453 --> 01:22:53,444
I don't know.
Have you?

1312
01:22:53,522 --> 01:22:56,286
Oh, so you pretend
not to believe it.

1313
01:22:56,358 --> 01:22:58,292
Yes, I pretend not to.

1314
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,590
- Then you don't know women.
- That's possible.

1315
01:23:00,662 --> 01:23:03,153
- And you're a fool.
- That's quite possible.

1316
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:07,359
- You won't be too hard on her?
- I'll make up my own mind what I'll be!

1317
01:23:07,436 --> 01:23:09,199
We're all only human, you know.

1318
01:23:09,271 --> 01:23:12,331
You! All of you with
your sophisticated ideas!

1319
01:23:13,142 --> 01:23:14,803
Ain't it awful?

1320
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:23,111
Why, you low...

1321
01:23:25,854 --> 01:23:27,287
What right have you...

1322
01:23:27,356 --> 01:23:29,950
A husband's.
'Til tomorrow, Kittredge.

1323
01:23:33,462 --> 01:23:35,396
Hey, fella.

1324
01:23:36,598 --> 01:23:39,192
How do you feel?

1325
01:23:39,268 --> 01:23:41,202
- If you think I...
- I know.

1326
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:43,966
I'm sorry. I thought I'd better
hit you before he did.

1327
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:47,031
He's in better shape than I am.

1328
01:23:47,109 --> 01:23:48,974
Well, you'll do.

1329
01:23:51,146 --> 01:23:54,172
Hello, Mr. Dexter.
Anything wrong?

1330
01:23:54,249 --> 01:23:56,877
Not a thing, Mac.
Just as quiet as a church.

1331
01:23:56,952 --> 01:23:58,886
Who is it?

1332
01:24:02,324 --> 01:24:05,384
Doggone. I thought it
might've been Mr. Kittredge.

1333
01:24:05,461 --> 01:24:07,361
We can't have everything, Mac.

1334
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:10,157
Good night.

1335
01:24:34,857 --> 01:24:36,882
- Mr. Tracy...
- Good grief, man.

1336
01:24:36,959 --> 01:24:39,689
Don't scream at me at the top
of your voice like that.

1337
01:24:39,761 --> 01:24:41,820
Miss Dinah is waiting for you, sir.

1338
01:24:41,897 --> 01:24:44,297
Miss Dinah waiting for me?
Where and why?

1339
01:24:44,366 --> 01:24:46,698
Just outside the door, sir.
I don't know why.

1340
01:24:46,768 --> 01:24:49,999
This is one of those days
which the pages of history teach us...

1341
01:24:50,072 --> 01:24:52,563
are best spent lying in bed.

1342
01:24:59,681 --> 01:25:01,342
Uncle Willie!

1343
01:25:02,417 --> 01:25:04,476
Uncle Willie,
where are you going?

1344
01:25:04,553 --> 01:25:06,487
Back to bed, unless you
give me your oath...

1345
01:25:06,555 --> 01:25:08,489
you will speak in
a civilized tone of voice.

1346
01:25:08,557 --> 01:25:11,890
I'll be quiet, Uncle Willie.
It's so important that I see you.

1347
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:15,589
Must we ride in that thing? Wouldn't we
be more comfortable on pogo sticks?

1348
01:25:15,664 --> 01:25:18,861
I had to be alone with you,
and this is very intimate.

1349
01:25:30,946 --> 01:25:33,312
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing much.

1350
01:25:33,382 --> 01:25:35,316
My head just fell off, that's all.

1351
01:25:37,085 --> 01:25:40,816
What is all this gibberish
about Mr. Connor?

1352
01:25:40,889 --> 01:25:43,881
What makes you suspect what
and since when?

1353
01:25:43,959 --> 01:25:47,326
Last night,
and well into the morning.

1354
01:25:47,396 --> 01:25:49,887
Uncle Willie,
isn't my duty to tell George?

1355
01:25:49,965 --> 01:25:51,728
He might want to marry her anyway.

1356
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,736
But she can't. If she marries anyone,
it's got to be Mr. Connor.

1357
01:25:55,804 --> 01:25:58,932
Why, Dinah.
What makes you think she should?

1358
01:25:59,007 --> 01:26:02,033
Apparently the little cherub
has heard or seen something.

1359
01:26:03,111 --> 01:26:05,102
That's Dexter's own Dinah.

1360
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:08,513
You have a certain amount of cheek
walking in here on this of all mornings.

1361
01:26:08,584 --> 01:26:10,950
- Do I?
- Yes.

1362
01:26:11,019 --> 01:26:12,953
What's all this
about Mr. Connor, Dinah?

1363
01:26:13,021 --> 01:26:15,319
Did the party last night
give you bad dreams?

1364
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:18,223
- It wasn't any dream.
- I wouldn't be too sure.

1365
01:26:18,293 --> 01:26:20,625
It's hard to tell once you've
gone to sleep, isn't it?

1366
01:26:20,696 --> 01:26:21,958
Is it?

1367
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:26,463
What-ho, the bride.

1368
01:26:32,874 --> 01:26:34,136
Hello.

1369
01:26:34,943 --> 01:26:38,435
Um, isn't it a fine day, though.

1370
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:43,112
Is everybody fine?

1371
01:26:44,353 --> 01:26:45,752
That's fine.

1372
01:26:47,556 --> 01:26:49,490
My, I'm hearty.

1373
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,594
How do you feel otherwise?

1374
01:26:53,662 --> 01:26:55,653
I don't know what's the matter with me.

1375
01:26:55,731 --> 01:26:57,699
I must have had
too much sun yesterday.

1376
01:26:57,766 --> 01:27:00,394
- My eyes don't open properly.
- Really?

1377
01:27:00,469 --> 01:27:03,996
Ugh! Please go home, Dext.

1378
01:27:04,072 --> 01:27:06,097
Not until we've got
those eyes open.

1379
01:27:06,174 --> 01:27:08,369
Uncle Willie. Good morning.

1380
01:27:08,443 --> 01:27:10,172
That remains to be seen.

1381
01:27:11,513 --> 01:27:13,708
Aren't you here early,
Uncle Willie?

1382
01:27:13,782 --> 01:27:16,182
It's nearly half past twelve.

1383
01:27:16,251 --> 01:27:18,219
It can't be.
Where's Mother?

1384
01:27:18,287 --> 01:27:21,120
She's talking with the orchestra.
Father with the minister.

1385
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:24,989
And Mr. Connor,
he hasn't come down yet.

1386
01:27:26,328 --> 01:27:28,262
And it's Saturday,
your wedding day, remember?

1387
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:31,322
Thanks loads.
It's nice to have things account...

1388
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,334
Only I wonder
what this might be.

1389
01:27:33,402 --> 01:27:35,427
- That looks like a wristwatch.
- But whose?

1390
01:27:35,504 --> 01:27:37,699
I found it in my room.
I nearly stepped on it.

1391
01:27:42,411 --> 01:27:46,609
Also, I think I was robbed at your house
last night, Uncle Willie.

1392
01:27:46,682 --> 01:27:49,207
My bracelet and engagement rings
are missing...

1393
01:27:49,284 --> 01:27:52,310
- Here you are.
- But you weren't at the party.

1394
01:27:52,387 --> 01:27:53,877
- Wasn't I?
- Were you?

1395
01:27:53,955 --> 01:27:56,651
Don't tell me you don't remember.

1396
01:27:56,725 --> 01:28:00,126
I do, now, sort of.

1397
01:28:00,195 --> 01:28:03,494
But there were such a lot of people.
I stayed so late.

1398
01:28:03,565 --> 01:28:05,624
You should have taken a quick swim
when you got home.

1399
01:28:05,701 --> 01:28:06,998
A swim?

1400
01:28:07,736 --> 01:28:09,465
A swim!

1401
01:28:09,538 --> 01:28:11,369
There! Now they're open.

1402
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:15,342
That was just the beginning,
and it was no dream.

1403
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:19,670
Do you suppose,
speaking of eye-openers...

1404
01:28:19,748 --> 01:28:22,581
That's the first sane remark
I've heard today. Come along.

1405
01:28:22,651 --> 01:28:26,246
I know a formula that can pop pennies
off the eyelids of dead Irishmen.

1406
01:28:27,522 --> 01:28:29,683
Dinah, if the conversation
should lag...

1407
01:28:29,758 --> 01:28:32,352
you might tell Tracy
about your dream.

1408
01:28:32,427 --> 01:28:35,097
- What did he say?
- Oh, nothing.

1409
01:28:35,097 --> 01:28:35,529
- What did he say?
- Oh, nothing.

1410
01:28:35,597 --> 01:28:38,122
Tray, I hate you to get married
and go away.

1411
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:41,499
I'll miss you, darling.
I'll miss all of you.

1412
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:45,597
You know, I did have the funniest
dream about you last night.

1413
01:28:45,674 --> 01:28:47,835
Did you? Do you like
my dress, Dinah?

1414
01:28:47,909 --> 01:28:50,878
- Yes, ever so much.
- Feels awfully heavy.

1415
01:28:50,946 --> 01:28:53,346
It was all certainly
pretty rooty-tooty.

1416
01:28:53,415 --> 01:28:55,940
- What was?
- My dream.

1417
01:28:56,017 --> 01:28:59,180
I dreamed I got up
and went over to the window.

1418
01:28:59,254 --> 01:29:02,189
Guess what I dreamed I saw coming over
out of the woods.

1419
01:29:02,257 --> 01:29:05,283
I haven't the faintest idea.
A skunk?

1420
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,921
Well, sort of.
It was Mr. Connor.

1421
01:29:08,997 --> 01:29:10,430
Mr. Connor?

1422
01:29:10,499 --> 01:29:15,596
Yes, with his arms full of something,
and guess what it turned out to be.

1423
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:18,935
- What?
- You, and some clothes.

1424
01:29:19,007 --> 01:29:23,535
Wasn't it funny? It was sort of like
as if you were coming from the pool.

1425
01:29:24,913 --> 01:29:26,904
The pool?

1426
01:29:26,982 --> 01:29:30,509
I'm going crazy. I'm standing here,
solidly, on my own two hands...

1427
01:29:30,585 --> 01:29:32,553
and going crazy.

1428
01:29:32,621 --> 01:29:36,955
- Then what?
- After a while, I opened my door...

1429
01:29:37,025 --> 01:29:39,550
and there he was in the hall,
still coming along with you...

1430
01:29:39,628 --> 01:29:41,926
puffing like a steam engine.

1431
01:29:41,997 --> 01:29:43,988
His wind can't be very good.

1432
01:29:44,065 --> 01:29:45,293
Then what?

1433
01:29:45,367 --> 01:29:48,666
- You were sort of crooning.
- I never crooned in my life.

1434
01:29:48,737 --> 01:29:51,467
I'm only saying
what it sounded like.

1435
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:52,973
And then he...

1436
01:29:54,309 --> 01:29:55,901
Guess what.

1437
01:29:55,977 --> 01:29:57,308
I couldn't possibly.

1438
01:29:57,379 --> 01:30:00,610
He sailed right into your room
with you, and that scared me...

1439
01:30:00,682 --> 01:30:02,809
so I got up
and went to your door...

1440
01:30:02,884 --> 01:30:06,047
and peeked in
to make sure you were all right.

1441
01:30:06,121 --> 01:30:07,952
And guess what.

1442
01:30:09,057 --> 01:30:11,753
- What?
- You were. He was gone by then.

1443
01:30:12,661 --> 01:30:15,061
Gone?

1444
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:18,293
Of course he was gone.
He was never there.

1445
01:30:18,366 --> 01:30:19,663
I know, Tracy.

1446
01:30:19,734 --> 01:30:23,226
- I should certainly hope you did.
- I'm certainly glad I do.

1447
01:30:23,305 --> 01:30:27,799
Because if I didn't, and in a little
while I heard the minister say...

1448
01:30:27,876 --> 01:30:31,403
"If anyone knows any just cause
or reason why these two...

1449
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,313
"should not be united
in holy matrimony..."

1450
01:30:34,382 --> 01:30:36,441
I just wouldn't know what to do.

1451
01:30:36,518 --> 01:30:40,454
- Dexter says it's a dream too.
- You told Dexter all that?

1452
01:30:40,522 --> 01:30:43,286
Not a word.
Not a single word.

1453
01:30:43,358 --> 01:30:45,223
You know how quick he is.

1454
01:30:45,293 --> 01:30:47,318
You little fiend.
How can you stand there...

1455
01:30:47,395 --> 01:30:49,727
Dinah, your mother wants
to have a look at you.

1456
01:30:49,798 --> 01:30:52,665
I look wonderful.
I smell good too.

1457
01:30:52,734 --> 01:30:54,725
- Father?
- Yes, Tracy.

1458
01:30:56,905 --> 01:30:59,897
I'm glad you came back.

1459
01:31:01,076 --> 01:31:02,737
I'm glad you're here.

1460
01:31:02,811 --> 01:31:04,073
Thank you, child.

1461
01:31:05,347 --> 01:31:11,149
I'm sorry I'm... truly sorry
I'm a disappointment to you.

1462
01:31:11,219 --> 01:31:13,278
I never said that, daughter.

1463
01:31:14,756 --> 01:31:16,018
I never will.

1464
01:31:23,598 --> 01:31:25,896
- Good morning.
- Oh. Hello.

1465
01:31:28,904 --> 01:31:30,394
I'm testing the air.

1466
01:31:30,472 --> 01:31:32,702
I like it,
but it doesn't like me.

1467
01:31:33,441 --> 01:31:34,703
Hello, Dinah.

1468
01:31:34,776 --> 01:31:37,074
How do you do?

1469
01:31:37,145 --> 01:31:39,010
Did you have a good sleep?

1470
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,071
Wonderful. Wonderful.
And you?

1471
01:31:41,149 --> 01:31:44,277
Marvelous. Have you
ever seen a handsomer day?

1472
01:31:44,352 --> 01:31:46,650
Never, never.
What'd it set you back?

1473
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:48,882
I got it for nothing
for being a good girl.

1474
01:31:48,957 --> 01:31:50,390
Good. Good.

1475
01:31:52,294 --> 01:31:54,558
Don't worry, I'm going.

1476
01:31:54,629 --> 01:31:55,994
Why should you?

1477
01:31:56,064 --> 01:31:59,227
I guess you must have things
you wish to discuss.

1478
01:31:59,301 --> 01:32:02,293
Only remember, it's getting late.

1479
01:32:05,607 --> 01:32:09,236
She's always trying
to make situations.

1480
01:32:19,754 --> 01:32:22,416
- What's the matter with your chin?
- Chin?

1481
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:24,958
Oh. Does it show that much?

1482
01:32:25,026 --> 01:32:26,459
A little. What happened?

1483
01:32:26,528 --> 01:32:29,053
I guess I stuck it out too far.

1484
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:31,360
Into a door in the dark?

1485
01:32:31,433 --> 01:32:35,233
Yes, that's it.
What about you? You all right?

1486
01:32:35,303 --> 01:32:36,497
- Me?
- Yeah.

1487
01:32:36,571 --> 01:32:39,096
Of course.
Why shouldn't I be?

1488
01:32:39,174 --> 01:32:41,734
That was a flock of wine
we got away with.

1489
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:44,677
I guess we're lucky
both to have such good heads.

1490
01:32:44,746 --> 01:32:47,715
Yeah, yeah, I guess that's it.

1491
01:32:49,117 --> 01:32:52,177
Well, anyway, I...

1492
01:32:52,253 --> 01:32:55,780
I had a simply wonderful evening.
I hope you enjoyed it too.

1493
01:32:55,857 --> 01:32:57,791
I enjoyed the last part of it.

1494
01:32:58,893 --> 01:33:00,724
Really?

1495
01:33:00,795 --> 01:33:03,127
Why especially the last?

1496
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:05,189
Tracy, are you asking me?

1497
01:33:06,801 --> 01:33:08,792
- Oh, you mean the swim.
- Yeah.

1498
01:33:09,871 --> 01:33:11,304
We did swim...

1499
01:33:13,108 --> 01:33:15,542
and so forth, didn't we?

1500
01:33:16,678 --> 01:33:18,737
- Mike.
- Oh, Tracy, darling.

1501
01:33:18,813 --> 01:33:20,974
- What can I say to you?
- Not anything.

1502
01:33:21,049 --> 01:33:23,483
Don't say anything
and especially not "darling."

1503
01:33:26,054 --> 01:33:28,454
- You're going through with it?
- Through with what?

1504
01:33:28,523 --> 01:33:30,491
The wedding.

1505
01:33:30,558 --> 01:33:32,321
Why shouldn't I?

1506
01:33:33,695 --> 01:33:36,493
Well, I made a funny discovery.

1507
01:33:36,564 --> 01:33:39,158
In spite of the fact that
somebody's up from the bottom...

1508
01:33:39,234 --> 01:33:41,361
he can still be quite a heel...

1509
01:33:41,436 --> 01:33:45,031
and even though somebody else
is born to the purple, he...

1510
01:33:45,106 --> 01:33:47,574
he can still be
a very nice guy.

1511
01:33:47,642 --> 01:33:51,100
I'm just repeating
what you said last night.

1512
01:33:51,179 --> 01:33:54,842
I said a lot of things
last night, it seems.

1513
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:56,975
Okay. No dice.

1514
01:33:58,119 --> 01:34:00,747
Also no regrets
about last night, huh?

1515
01:34:00,822 --> 01:34:02,517
Why should I have?

1516
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:04,683
Tracy, you're wonderful.

1517
01:34:04,759 --> 01:34:09,696
I'm asking you. Tell me straight out.
Tell me the reason why I should have.

1518
01:34:09,764 --> 01:34:11,698
No, don't.

1519
01:34:11,766 --> 01:34:13,791
Just tell me, what time is it?

1520
01:34:14,502 --> 01:34:15,935
What? Oh.

1521
01:34:17,706 --> 01:34:19,833
What happened to my wristwatch?

1522
01:34:19,908 --> 01:34:21,876
Why, is it broken?

1523
01:34:21,943 --> 01:34:23,968
I must've lost it someplace.

1524
01:34:24,045 --> 01:34:27,845
I can't tell you how extremely sorry
I am to hear that.

1525
01:34:29,584 --> 01:34:31,677
There. On the table.

1526
01:34:31,753 --> 01:34:35,450
I wonder who found it.
I'd offer a reward or something.

1527
01:34:35,523 --> 01:34:38,651
I don't think that any reward
will be expected.

1528
01:34:39,861 --> 01:34:42,694
Funny that it'd pop up here.

1529
01:34:42,764 --> 01:34:46,393
Hey, what about an eye-opener?

1530
01:34:46,468 --> 01:34:50,529
My eyes are opened.
Go and get one if you want to, though.

1531
01:34:50,605 --> 01:34:52,573
Yeah, I think I will.
Excuse me.

1532
01:34:53,508 --> 01:34:55,271
Yes, yes.

1533
01:34:56,377 --> 01:34:58,368
Just give Mr. Kittredge a message.

1534
01:34:58,446 --> 01:35:01,438
Tell him he'd better start
immediately. Thank you.

1535
01:35:02,584 --> 01:35:04,984
- Are you one of the musicians?
- Uh, no.

1536
01:35:05,053 --> 01:35:07,214
Of course,
you're Junius's friend.

1537
01:35:07,288 --> 01:35:10,746
Only you're not. You don't have
any violin strings, do you?

1538
01:35:13,561 --> 01:35:15,654
- Aspirin. Will that do?
- I don't think so.

1539
01:35:15,730 --> 01:35:18,221
It's for a violin.
Oh, well, don't bother.

1540
01:35:26,407 --> 01:35:29,706
- Hello, Connor. How are you?
- Just about as you'd think.

1541
01:35:29,778 --> 01:35:31,040
You seen Kidd?

1542
01:35:31,112 --> 01:35:33,046
I left a copy of it
at my house for him.

1543
01:35:33,114 --> 01:35:35,742
- And?
- I'll tangle with him after the wedding.

1544
01:35:35,817 --> 01:35:38,115
- Is that an alcoholic beverage?
- Yes. Why?

1545
01:35:38,186 --> 01:35:40,279
- For me?
- No, for Tracy. You want one?

1546
01:35:40,355 --> 01:35:43,984
I'd sell my grandmother for a drink.
You know how I love my grandmother.

1547
01:35:44,058 --> 01:35:47,516
Uncle Willie's in the pantry
doing weird and wonderful things.

1548
01:35:47,595 --> 01:35:49,859
Tell him I said
one of the same.

1549
01:35:49,931 --> 01:35:51,558
Mind if I make it two?

1550
01:35:51,633 --> 01:35:53,624
That's between you
and your grandmother.

1551
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:12,515
Doctor's orders, Red.

1552
01:36:12,587 --> 01:36:14,020
What is it?

1553
01:36:14,088 --> 01:36:16,989
Just the juice
of a few flowers.

1554
01:36:17,058 --> 01:36:19,788
It's a type of stinger.
Removes the sting.

1555
01:36:19,861 --> 01:36:23,627
- Oh, Dext, don't say that.
- Why not, Red?

1556
01:36:23,698 --> 01:36:26,064
Nothing will.
Nothing ever can.

1557
01:36:29,571 --> 01:36:32,062
I've done the most
terrible thing to you.

1558
01:36:32,807 --> 01:36:34,399
To me?

1559
01:36:34,475 --> 01:36:37,035
I doubt that very much, dear.

1560
01:36:37,111 --> 01:36:39,045
You don't know.

1561
01:36:39,113 --> 01:36:40,341
Maybe I shouldn't, huh?

1562
01:36:40,415 --> 01:36:44,317
But you must. You've got to.
I couldn't stand it if you didn't.

1563
01:36:44,385 --> 01:36:46,751
Dexter, what am I going to do?

1564
01:36:46,821 --> 01:36:49,756
But why to me, darling?
Why ask me?

1565
01:36:51,025 --> 01:36:53,789
Why do I come into it anymore?

1566
01:36:53,862 --> 01:36:57,423
Aren't you confusing me with a fellow
named Kittredge or something?

1567
01:36:57,498 --> 01:36:58,829
George!

1568
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:02,996
George. Splendid chap, George.
Very high morals.

1569
01:37:03,071 --> 01:37:04,595
Very broad shoulders.

1570
01:37:04,672 --> 01:37:06,435
I've got to tell him.

1571
01:37:06,507 --> 01:37:09,874
- Tell him what, darling?
- I've got to tell him.

1572
01:37:10,945 --> 01:37:13,641
If you've got to tell him,
you've got to tell him.

1573
01:37:13,715 --> 01:37:16,650
If he's got any brains, he'll have
realized what a fool he made of himself.

1574
01:37:16,718 --> 01:37:19,653
Hello, George?
This is... yeah.

1575
01:37:19,721 --> 01:37:21,848
I don't care whether
it's bad luck or not...

1576
01:37:21,923 --> 01:37:24,619
but I've got to see you
before the wedding.

1577
01:37:24,692 --> 01:37:27,354
What? No, I didn't get it.

1578
01:37:27,428 --> 01:37:29,191
Right. Come on the run.

1579
01:37:29,264 --> 01:37:31,289
- He sent a note over at ten.
- Good.

1580
01:37:31,366 --> 01:37:33,300
I told you he'd come to his senses.

1581
01:37:34,269 --> 01:37:37,067
- Was he here too?
- Sure.

1582
01:37:37,138 --> 01:37:39,732
Good golly.
Why didn't you sell tickets?

1583
01:37:53,354 --> 01:37:54,844
Say something, Dext.

1584
01:37:56,357 --> 01:37:57,790
Say anything.

1585
01:37:59,961 --> 01:38:03,158
- No, you do.
- Oh, Dext!

1586
01:38:03,231 --> 01:38:05,859
I'm such an unholy mess of a girl.

1587
01:38:07,368 --> 01:38:09,529
That's no good.
That's not even conversation.

1588
01:38:11,372 --> 01:38:14,034
But never in my life...

1589
01:38:14,108 --> 01:38:16,633
not if I live to be a hundred...

1590
01:38:16,711 --> 01:38:20,477
will I ever forget how you tried
to stand me on my feet again today.

1591
01:38:20,548 --> 01:38:22,539
Oh, you, you're in great shape.

1592
01:38:25,186 --> 01:38:28,383
Tell me, what did you think
of my wedding present?

1593
01:38:28,456 --> 01:38:30,788
I like my presents
at least acknowledged, you know.

1594
01:38:30,858 --> 01:38:32,291
It was beautiful.

1595
01:38:33,828 --> 01:38:35,819
And sweet, Dext.

1596
01:38:35,897 --> 01:38:40,925
Yes. She was quite a boat,
the True Love, wasn't she?

1597
01:38:41,002 --> 01:38:43,527
Was and is.

1598
01:38:45,573 --> 01:38:47,131
My, she was yare!

1599
01:38:48,309 --> 01:38:50,300
She was yare, all right.

1600
01:38:52,613 --> 01:38:55,275
I wasn't, was I?

1601
01:38:57,352 --> 01:38:58,614
Not very.

1602
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,647
You were good
at the bright work, though.

1603
01:39:01,723 --> 01:39:03,315
I made her shine.

1604
01:39:04,559 --> 01:39:06,584
Where is she now?

1605
01:39:06,661 --> 01:39:08,686
I'm gonna sell her to Rufe Watriss.

1606
01:39:09,831 --> 01:39:13,631
You're going to sell
the True Love for money?

1607
01:39:13,701 --> 01:39:16,192
- Sure.
- To that fat old rum pot?

1608
01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:18,431
Oh, well, what does it matter?

1609
01:39:18,506 --> 01:39:20,497
When you're through with a boat,
you're through.

1610
01:39:21,843 --> 01:39:24,175
Besides, it was only comfortable
for two people.

1611
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:27,013
Unless you want her.

1612
01:39:28,516 --> 01:39:31,178
No. No, I don't want her.

1613
01:39:34,088 --> 01:39:36,283
I'm designing another one anyway...

1614
01:39:36,357 --> 01:39:38,348
along more practical lines.

1615
01:39:39,127 --> 01:39:41,322
What will you call her?

1616
01:39:41,396 --> 01:39:44,331
I thought the True Love II.
What do you think?

1617
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:48,460
If you call any boat that, I promise
I'll blow you and it out of the water.

1618
01:39:48,536 --> 01:39:50,936
I'll tell you
what you can call her.

1619
01:39:51,005 --> 01:39:54,600
- What?
- In fond remembrance of me...

1620
01:39:54,675 --> 01:39:56,870
the Easy Virtue.

1621
01:39:56,944 --> 01:40:00,141
Shut up, Red. I can't have you thinking
things like that about yourself.

1622
01:40:00,214 --> 01:40:04,708
What am I supposed to think when I...
I don't know.

1623
01:40:04,786 --> 01:40:06,720
I don't know anything anymore.

1624
01:40:07,789 --> 01:40:10,155
That sounds very hopeful, Red.

1625
01:40:10,224 --> 01:40:11,623
That sounds just fine.

1626
01:40:14,195 --> 01:40:17,358
We're almost ready.
Stand up, dear.

1627
01:40:17,432 --> 01:40:20,424
Turn around.
Oh, yes, it's lovely.

1628
01:40:20,501 --> 01:40:23,527
I'm glad we decided against...
Dexter, you shouldn't be here...

1629
01:40:23,604 --> 01:40:25,094
against the blue one.

1630
01:40:25,173 --> 01:40:27,641
No games, Dexter.
George will be right over.

1631
01:40:27,708 --> 01:40:30,700
I just telephoned. Here's a note
he sent you this morning.

1632
01:40:30,778 --> 01:40:33,906
Oh, dear,
doesn't everything look lovely?

1633
01:40:33,981 --> 01:40:35,710
Dr. Parsons?

1634
01:40:37,118 --> 01:40:39,780
Mr. Kittredge hasn't arrived yet,
Dr. Parsons.

1635
01:40:39,854 --> 01:40:42,084
Come along. I want you
to meet Tracy's grandmother.

1636
01:40:42,156 --> 01:40:45,557
Tracy, don't sit down again
until after the ceremony.

1637
01:40:45,626 --> 01:40:48,754
Dexter, they telephoned from your house
that a Mr. Sidney Kidd was there.

1638
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:52,231
I was to tell you that he's reading it.
Whatever does that mean?

1639
01:40:54,368 --> 01:40:57,735
I have a feeling it won't be
so hard for me to resign now.

1640
01:40:57,805 --> 01:41:00,103
And belts will be worn tighter
this winter.

1641
01:41:01,676 --> 01:41:04,611
Well, Red, I'm afraid
it's the deadline.

1642
01:41:05,847 --> 01:41:07,405
So is this. Listen.

1643
01:41:07,482 --> 01:41:10,110
"My dear Tracy, I want you to know
that you will always be my friend...

1644
01:41:10,184 --> 01:41:13,950
"but your conduct last night was so
shocking to my ideals of womanhood..."

1645
01:41:14,021 --> 01:41:17,081
No, don't go.
You might as well hear it too.

1646
01:41:17,158 --> 01:41:19,251
"To my ideals of womanhood
that my attitude toward you...

1647
01:41:19,327 --> 01:41:21,625
"and the prospect of a happy
and useful life together...

1648
01:41:21,696 --> 01:41:23,357
"has been changed materially.

1649
01:41:24,499 --> 01:41:26,763
- "Your breach of common decency..."
- Tracy.

1650
01:41:28,169 --> 01:41:30,103
Hello, George.

1651
01:41:30,171 --> 01:41:32,264
Tracy, all these people.

1652
01:41:35,143 --> 01:41:37,475
It's only a letter
from a friend.

1653
01:41:37,545 --> 01:41:39,479
They're my friends too.

1654
01:41:40,781 --> 01:41:42,908
"...certainly entitles me
to a full explanation...

1655
01:41:42,984 --> 01:41:45,953
"before going through
with our proposed marriage.

1656
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:49,751
"In the light of day, I am sure
that you will agree with me.

1657
01:41:49,824 --> 01:41:52,759
"Otherwise, with profound regrets
and all best wishes...

1658
01:41:52,827 --> 01:41:54,317
"yours very sincere..."

1659
01:41:55,863 --> 01:41:58,491
Yes, George,
I quite agree with you.

1660
01:41:58,566 --> 01:42:01,296
In the light of day
and the dark of night...

1661
01:42:01,369 --> 01:42:05,066
for richer, for poorer,
for better, for worse...

1662
01:42:05,139 --> 01:42:07,539
in sickness and in health and...

1663
01:42:08,809 --> 01:42:12,677
Thank you so very much
for your good wishes at this time.

1664
01:42:12,747 --> 01:42:15,944
- That's all you have to say?
- What else?

1665
01:42:16,017 --> 01:42:18,850
I wish, for your sake
as well as mine...

1666
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:21,354
I had an explanation, but...

1667
01:42:21,422 --> 01:42:24,186
unfortunately, I have none.

1668
01:42:24,258 --> 01:42:26,488
You'd better just say
good riddance, George.

1669
01:42:26,561 --> 01:42:28,495
- It isn't easy.
- I don't see why.

1670
01:42:29,964 --> 01:42:32,194
- Say something, stupid!
- Just wait a minute.

1671
01:42:32,266 --> 01:42:33,563
What for?

1672
01:42:33,634 --> 01:42:36,660
On the very eve of your wedding,
an affair with another man!

1673
01:42:36,737 --> 01:42:39,968
I told you I agree, and I'll
tell you again, good riddance to me.

1674
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:43,101
Tracy, your attitude
is a little difficult to understand.

1675
01:42:43,177 --> 01:42:45,668
- Yes, I can see that it would be.
- Not necessarily.

1676
01:42:45,746 --> 01:42:49,409
- You keep out of this.
- You forget, I am out of it.

1677
01:42:49,483 --> 01:42:52,543
Kittredge, it may
interest you to know...

1678
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:55,316
that this so-called "affair"
consisted of exactly two kisses...

1679
01:42:55,389 --> 01:42:56,981
and a late swim.

1680
01:42:57,058 --> 01:42:58,889
- Thanks, but...
- Which I enjoyed...

1681
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:01,758
and the memory of which
I wouldn't part with for anything.

1682
01:43:01,829 --> 01:43:03,854
- It's no use, Mike.
- After which...

1683
01:43:03,931 --> 01:43:07,389
I deposited Tracy on her bed
in her room...

1684
01:43:07,468 --> 01:43:10,198
and returned down here to you two,
which doubtless you'll remember.

1685
01:43:10,271 --> 01:43:12,262
Doubtless without a doubt.

1686
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:15,036
You mean to say
that was all there was to it?

1687
01:43:15,109 --> 01:43:16,440
I do.

1688
01:43:18,112 --> 01:43:22,879
Why? Was I so unattractive,
so distant, so forbidding or something?

1689
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:25,646
- This is fine talk too.
- I'm asking a question.

1690
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:28,848
You were extremely attractive,
and as for distant and forbidding...

1691
01:43:28,923 --> 01:43:31,983
on the contrary, but you also
were a little the worse...

1692
01:43:32,059 --> 01:43:35,722
or better... for wine,
and there are rules about that.

1693
01:43:35,796 --> 01:43:38,959
Thank you, Mike.
I think men are wonderful.

1694
01:43:39,033 --> 01:43:40,762
The little dears.

1695
01:43:40,835 --> 01:43:43,702
I fail to see the humor
in this situation, Miss Imbrie.

1696
01:43:43,771 --> 01:43:47,002
I can appreciate that.
It was hard for me too at first.

1697
01:43:47,074 --> 01:43:49,099
- Oh, Liz.
- It's all right, Tracy.

1698
01:43:49,176 --> 01:43:53,476
We all go haywire at times,
and if we don't, maybe we ought to.

1699
01:43:55,149 --> 01:43:58,846
You see, it really wasn't Tracy
at all, Mr. Kittredge.

1700
01:43:58,919 --> 01:44:03,083
It was another girl.
A Miss Pommery, 1926.

1701
01:44:03,157 --> 01:44:06,149
You'd had too much to drink, Tracy.

1702
01:44:06,227 --> 01:44:09,458
That seems to be
the consensus of opinion.

1703
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:12,829
Will you promise me
never to touch the stuff again?

1704
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:16,700
No, George.
I don't believe I will.

1705
01:44:16,771 --> 01:44:18,864
There are certain things
about that other girl...

1706
01:44:18,939 --> 01:44:21,908
that... Miss Pommery '26,
I rather like.

1707
01:44:21,976 --> 01:44:24,706
- But a man expects his wife...
- To behave herself. Naturally.

1708
01:44:24,779 --> 01:44:26,713
To behave herself naturally.

1709
01:44:28,849 --> 01:44:30,180
Sorry.

1710
01:44:31,819 --> 01:44:35,949
If it hadn't been for that drink last
night, all this might not have happened.

1711
01:44:36,023 --> 01:44:38,457
Apparently nothing did.

1712
01:44:38,526 --> 01:44:40,494
What made you think it had?

1713
01:44:40,561 --> 01:44:42,756
Well, it didn't take
much imagination.

1714
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:46,163
Not much, perhaps,
but just of a certain kind.

1715
01:44:46,233 --> 01:44:48,326
It seems you didn't think
anything too well of yourself.

1716
01:44:48,402 --> 01:44:50,029
That's the odd thing.

1717
01:44:50,104 --> 01:44:53,540
Somehow I'd have hoped that you'd
think better of me than I did.

1718
01:44:53,607 --> 01:44:56,269
I'm not going to quibble.
All the evidence was there.

1719
01:44:56,344 --> 01:44:59,404
And I was guilty straight off
until I was proved innocent.

1720
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:01,505
Downright un-American,
if you ask me.

1721
01:45:01,582 --> 01:45:04,016
Nobody is asking you.

1722
01:45:04,085 --> 01:45:06,076
You forgot your hat, Miss Tracy.

1723
01:45:06,153 --> 01:45:09,611
You look lovely, Miss Tracy.
All our very best wishes.

1724
01:45:11,659 --> 01:45:15,254
Dexter, I wish you'd let me know when
you invite people to Tracy's weddings.

1725
01:45:15,329 --> 01:45:17,559
- What happened, darling?
- A Mr. Sidney Kidd is here.

1726
01:45:17,631 --> 01:45:19,656
He says he knows you.

1727
01:45:19,734 --> 01:45:22,032
Sidney Kidd is here himself?

1728
01:45:22,103 --> 01:45:24,264
What else did Mr. Sidney Kidd
have to say?

1729
01:45:24,338 --> 01:45:28,536
He sent you the strangest message.
He said, "Tell Haven he wins."

1730
01:45:28,609 --> 01:45:31,772
"Tell him I'm licked."
Wins what, Dexter?

1731
01:45:34,615 --> 01:45:38,642
Mr. Sidney Kidd's presence here makes
the marriage of national importance.

1732
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:41,187
I think it's extremely kind
and thoughtful of him.

1733
01:45:44,325 --> 01:45:47,453
Come on, Tracy, it must be late.
Let's let bygones be bygones.

1734
01:45:47,528 --> 01:45:49,393
What do you say?

1735
01:45:49,463 --> 01:45:52,557
Yes, and good-bye, George.

1736
01:45:54,201 --> 01:45:56,192
- I don't understand you.
- Please, good-bye.

1737
01:45:56,270 --> 01:45:58,204
- Look here...
- You're too good for me.

1738
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,263
- You're a hundred times too good.
- But I never said...

1739
01:46:00,341 --> 01:46:02,775
I'd make you most unhappy. Most.

1740
01:46:03,844 --> 01:46:05,937
That is, I'd do my best to.

1741
01:46:07,014 --> 01:46:09,881
Well, if that's
the way you want it.

1742
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:11,941
That's the way it is.

1743
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,884
All right.
Possibly it's just as well.

1744
01:46:15,956 --> 01:46:18,288
Yes, I thought you'd finally
come to that conclusion.

1745
01:46:20,394 --> 01:46:23,090
I have a feeling you had more
to do with this than anyone.

1746
01:46:23,164 --> 01:46:27,260
- Possibly, but you were a great help.
- You and your whole rotten class.

1747
01:46:27,334 --> 01:46:29,199
Class, my eye.

1748
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:32,137
You're on your way out,
the lot of you, and good riddance!

1749
01:46:34,508 --> 01:46:36,703
There goes George.

1750
01:46:44,518 --> 01:46:47,180
Oh, my sainted aunt!

1751
01:46:58,098 --> 01:47:01,226
- That welter of faces.
- Oh, my, they look solemn.

1752
01:47:01,302 --> 01:47:03,133
What am I to do?

1753
01:47:03,204 --> 01:47:04,637
- Tracy?
- Yes, Mike?

1754
01:47:04,705 --> 01:47:07,469
Parson Parsons has never seen
Kittredge before, has he?

1755
01:47:07,541 --> 01:47:11,238
I got you into this thing,
and I'll get you out of it.

1756
01:47:11,312 --> 01:47:13,303
Will you marry me, Tracy?

1757
01:47:19,487 --> 01:47:20,784
No, Mike.

1758
01:47:21,856 --> 01:47:26,088
Thanks, but hmm-mm. Nope.

1759
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,128
I've never asked a girl
to marry me.

1760
01:47:28,195 --> 01:47:29,753
I've avoided it.

1761
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:32,196
But you've got me
all confused now.

1762
01:47:32,266 --> 01:47:33,631
Why not?

1763
01:47:34,935 --> 01:47:37,369
Because I don't think Liz
would like it...

1764
01:47:38,739 --> 01:47:41,299
and I'm not sure you would...

1765
01:47:41,375 --> 01:47:45,038
and I'm even a little doubtful
about myself.

1766
01:47:46,113 --> 01:47:48,843
But I am beholden to you, Mike.

1767
01:47:48,916 --> 01:47:51,248
I'm most beholden.

1768
01:47:52,486 --> 01:47:54,750
But they're in there.
They're waiting.

1769
01:47:54,822 --> 01:47:58,417
Don't get too conventional all at once,
will ya? There'll be a reaction.

1770
01:48:00,828 --> 01:48:04,958
Cheer up. It'll be all right.
You've been got out of jams before.

1771
01:48:05,032 --> 01:48:07,023
- Been got out of them?
- Certainly.

1772
01:48:07,101 --> 01:48:09,592
Don't worry.
You always have been.

1773
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:14,767
We've seen George.
It's all right, dear.

1774
01:48:14,842 --> 01:48:16,833
Your father will make
a very simple announcement.

1775
01:48:16,911 --> 01:48:19,778
Is there anything special
you want me to say, Tracy?

1776
01:48:19,847 --> 01:48:23,374
Uh, no, no.
I'll say it.

1777
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:27,386
Whatever it is, I'll say it. I won't
be got out of anything anymore, thanks.

1778
01:48:36,463 --> 01:48:38,454
Hello.

1779
01:48:38,532 --> 01:48:41,558
Good morning. L...
Stop that music.

1780
01:48:42,903 --> 01:48:45,098
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting...

1781
01:48:45,172 --> 01:48:50,109
but there's been a slight hitch
in the proceedings.

1782
01:48:50,177 --> 01:48:54,273
I've made a terrible fool of myself,
which isn't unusual...

1783
01:48:54,348 --> 01:48:58,682
and my fiancé...
my fiancé that was, that is...

1784
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:03,416
he thinks we'd better call it a day,
and I quite agree with him.

1785
01:49:04,325 --> 01:49:06,054
Peace is wonderful.

1786
01:49:06,126 --> 01:49:09,425
Uh, bec... uh...
Dexter, what next?

1787
01:49:09,496 --> 01:49:12,761
Three years ago I did you out of
a wedding in this house by eloping.

1788
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:17,668
- Two years ago, you were invited...
- My dear, just a loan.

1789
01:49:17,738 --> 01:49:19,763
- Put this in your vest pocket.
- Don't have a vest.

1790
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,831
Then hold it in your hand.

1791
01:49:21,909 --> 01:49:24,503
- Which was very bad manners.
- Which was very bad manners.

1792
01:49:24,578 --> 01:49:27,741
I'll make it up to you by going through
with it now as originally planned.

1793
01:49:27,815 --> 01:49:29,806
I'll make it up to you by...

1794
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:36,913
by going beautifully through
with it now...

1795
01:49:36,991 --> 01:49:40,688
as originally and
most beautifully planned.

1796
01:49:40,761 --> 01:49:44,060
- So if you'll just keep your seats...
- So if you'll just keep your seats...

1797
01:49:44,131 --> 01:49:47,157
- That's all.
- Um, that's all.

1798
01:49:47,234 --> 01:49:49,532
- Are you sure?
- No, but I'll risk it. Will you?

1799
01:49:49,603 --> 01:49:53,630
You bet. You didn't do it to soften
the blow? Nor to save my face?

1800
01:49:53,707 --> 01:49:55,766
- No, it's a nice face.
- I'll be yare now.

1801
01:49:55,843 --> 01:49:59,142
- I'll promise to be yare.
- Be whatever you like. You all set?

1802
01:49:59,213 --> 01:50:00,976
- All set.
- Best man?

1803
01:50:01,048 --> 01:50:02,879
Honored, C.K.

1804
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:05,009
- Maid of honor?
- Matron of honor.

1805
01:50:05,085 --> 01:50:06,609
Remember Joe Smith.

1806
01:50:06,687 --> 01:50:08,621
How did this ever happen?

1807
01:50:09,857 --> 01:50:11,848
You'd better tell Mr. Dutton
to start the music.

1808
01:50:11,925 --> 01:50:14,917
This can't be happening. It just can't.
Come with me, Miss Imbrie.

1809
01:50:14,995 --> 01:50:16,929
Let's get in there.
Got the ring?

1810
01:50:16,997 --> 01:50:19,625
The way we're dressed,
we look like stowaways.

1811
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:21,167
See ya soon, Red.

1812
01:50:21,235 --> 01:50:22,668
See ya soon, Dext.

1813
01:50:26,907 --> 01:50:28,932
- Tracy, darling...
- I love you, Father.

1814
01:50:29,009 --> 01:50:30,169
I love you too.

1815
01:50:30,244 --> 01:50:33,042
Never in my life have I been
so full of love before.

1816
01:50:33,113 --> 01:50:35,206
Come along. Come along.

1817
01:50:35,282 --> 01:50:37,113
Wait. How do I look?

1818
01:50:37,184 --> 01:50:39,812
Like a queen.
Like a goddess.

1819
01:50:39,887 --> 01:50:42,082
- And you know how I feel?
- How?

1820
01:50:42,156 --> 01:50:44,522
Like a human.
Like a human being.

1821
01:50:44,591 --> 01:50:47,116
- Do you know how I feel?
- How?

1822
01:50:47,194 --> 01:50:48,456
Proud.

1823
01:51:21,762 --> 01:51:24,993
I did it.
I did it all.

1824
01:51:25,065 --> 01:51:28,193
I feel as though I've lived through
all this before in another life.
