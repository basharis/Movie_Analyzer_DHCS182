1
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,030
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,679
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,432
Should we try to contact them?

4
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,477
Won't matter.
My gut says they're down.

5
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,598
-We should start back.
-lf that ship can fly, we need it.

6
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,159
I was afraid you'd say that.

7
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,880
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

8
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,395
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

9
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,109
-Lines are crawling with calamari.
-The sooner we find them the better.

10
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,111
Thought you could use
something to eat.

11
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,759
Thank you.

12
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,310
Any change?

13
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,116
No.

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,795
-How is he?
-He's gonna be fine.

15
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,474
At least until he wakes up.

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,633
-What do you mean?
-Captain has some questions for him.

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,870
He'd better have some good answers.

18
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,077
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,153
-Why?
-VDTs maybe. I don't know.

20
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,471
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

21
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,551
Roland, I'd like to run another search
through the Matrix.

22
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,836
-For what?
-For Neo.

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,117
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,554
Please, for me.

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,228
This is what keeps bothering me.

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,311
What?

27
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,032
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,998
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

29
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,357
-Where?
-On someone jacked in.

30
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,756
The big bupkes. Nada.
He's not in there.

31
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,036
-Sir, I got the projections.
-How long?

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,557
Based on point of entry and past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

33
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,234
Jesus H. Christ.

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,833
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,276
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

36
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,115
And make sure we are running
on as few pads as possible.

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,352
-Hey! You got a call.
-What?

38
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,750
Operator.

39
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,395
It's Seraph.

40
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,636
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

41
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,518
Good morning.

42
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,071
-Who are you?
-My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,119
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,194
Are you lost, Neo?

45
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,114
-Where am l?
-This is the train station.

46
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,951
-This isn't the Matrix?
-That's where the train goes.

47
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,271
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,233
-Why not?
-He won't let you.

49
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,749
-Who won't?
-The Trainman. I don't like him.

50
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,117
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,034
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,471
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

53
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,316
One thing I've learned in all my years...

54
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,438
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

55
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,513
-Who are you?
-I'm the Oracle.

56
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,277
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

57
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,195
I'm sorry this had to happen.

58
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,796
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

59
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,758
-...but it wasn't meant to be.
-What happened?

60
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,637
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

61
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,154
What choice?

62
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,319
To help you, to guide Neo.

63
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,190
Now, since the real test for any choice is
having to make the same choice again...

64
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,035
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

65
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,159
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

66
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,959
...because here I am, at it again.

67
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,829
-Do you know what happened to Neo?
-Yes.

68
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,517
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

69
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,833
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,357
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

71
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,557
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

72
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,030
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

73
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,237
-Why?
-Because of who the Trainman works for.

74
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,152
The Merovingian.

75
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,712
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

76
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,239
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

77
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,035
For years he has protected me.

78
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,589
I hope he can do the same for you.

79
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,274
Please, follow me.

80
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,638
Oracle....

81
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,916
I know, Morpheus.

82
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,675
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

83
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,277
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

84
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,112
I don't.

85
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,840
I expect just what I've always expected:

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,118
For you to make up your own
damn mind. Believe me or don't.

87
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,479
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

88
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,871
He needs all our help.

89
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,874
-Are you from the Matrix?
-Yes.

90
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,314
No.

91
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,234
-I mean, I was.
-Why did you leave?

92
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,231
-I had to.
-I had to leave my home too.

93
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,990
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

94
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,593
Yes, Papa.

95
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,750
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

96
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,550
-I know you.
-Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

97
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,236
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

98
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,312
We are most honored to meet you.

99
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,990
-You are programs.
-Oh, yes.

100
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,439
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

101
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,513
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

102
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,069
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

103
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,950
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

104
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,593
It's okay.

105
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,353
I don't have an answer.

106
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,910
-I don't even know where "here" is.
-This place is nowhere.

107
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,754
It is between your world and our world.

108
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,078
-Who's the Trainman?
-He works for the Frenchman.

109
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,351
Why did I know you would say that?

110
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,308
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

111
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,234
-You know him?
-I know only what I need to know.

112
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,188
I know if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

113
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,477
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

114
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,198
Is that what you're doing here?

115
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,148
-Rama, please.
-I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

116
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,357
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

117
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,919
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,197
-You don't have to answer that question.
-No, I don't mind.

119
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,035
The answer is simple.

120
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,671
I love my daughter very much.

121
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,230
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

122
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,994
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

123
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,720
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

124
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,111
If it does not, it is deleted.

125
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,795
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

126
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,517
-You do not understand.
-I just have never--

127
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,955
Heard a program speak of love.

128
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,878
-lt is a human emotion.
-No, it is a word.

129
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,238
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

130
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,438
I see that you are in love.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,788
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

132
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,234
Anything.

133
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,311
Then perhaps the reason
you are here...

134
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,631
...is not so different
than the reason I am here.

135
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,830
That's him.

136
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,718
-Get away! Get away from me!
-We don't want trouble.

137
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,678
-Get the hell away from me!
-We need your help.

138
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,276
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

139
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,593
Oh, no!

140
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,998
Damn it!

141
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,754
-When is the train due?
-lt is already late.

142
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,036
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

143
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,551
You think it has something
to do with me?

144
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,994
I cannot say.

145
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,879
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

146
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,793
-You know the Oracle?
-Everyone knows the Oracle.

147
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,633
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

148
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,189
She promised to watch Sati
after we said goodbye.

149
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,271
Goodbye?

150
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,000
-You're not staying with her?
-lt is not possible.

151
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,039
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

152
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,510
-My wife and I must return to our world.
-Why?

153
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,598
-That is our karma.
-You believe in karma?

154
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,832
Karma is a word, like love.

155
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,718
A way of saying:

156
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,030
"What I am here to do. "

157
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,670
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

158
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,230
Grateful for my wonderful wife,
for my beautiful daughter.

159
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,279
They are gifts, and so I do
what I must do to honor them.

160
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,351
-Papa, the train!
-Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,877
Can I carry that for you?

162
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,951
All right.

163
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,394
Hurry it up, I'm late!

164
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,399
-Who are you?
-He is a friend.

165
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,833
I know you.

166
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,549
-So that's what they wanted.
-I need to get back.

167
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,955
I'll pay you whatever you want.

168
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,475
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.

169
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,278
Oh, no, no, no.

170
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,238
You'll stay here until
the Merovingian says different.

171
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,833
If I know him...

172
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,356
...you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.

173
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,435
-I don't want to hurt you.
-You don't get it.

174
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,068
I built this place.

175
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,392
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.

176
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,553
Down here, I'm God.

177
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,469
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.

178
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,473
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

179
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,279
No. We know what has to be done.

180
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,594
Shit.

181
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,155
You gotta be kidding.

182
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,276
Holy shit, it's wingless.

183
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,519
I get it.

184
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,399
You must be ready to die.

185
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,153
I need to speak with him.

186
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,791
Only way you're getting through
this door is over my big, dead ass.

187
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,834
So be it.

188
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,429
There are no weapons allowed
in the club.

189
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,876
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl...

190
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,112
...and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.

191
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,357
And if we're unlucky?

192
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,272
There will be many men.

193
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,639
Can I take your--? Oh, my God.

194
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,949
What in the hell?

195
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,352
I don't believe this.

196
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,314
Hey!

197
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,358
The prodigal child returns.

198
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,355
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

199
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,073
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

200
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,277
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.

201
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,159
-We only want to talk.
-Oh, yes.

202
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,474
I'm sure you do. You have fought
through Hel to do so. Yes?

203
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,751
I'll tell you what I will do.

204
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,708
Put down the guns, and I will promise
you a safe passage out of here.

205
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,389
-All three of us?
-Oh, yes, yes.

206
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,158
Of course.

207
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,672
Who could have guessed we'd see each
other so soon after our last meeting?

208
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,798
The Fates are too kind, eh?

209
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,316
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here...

210
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,110
...I can only surmise the fortuneteller
has found herself another shell?

211
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,397
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

212
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,916
I do hope, however, she has the good
manners to learn her lesson...

213
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,277
...and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

214
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,309
And if you take something from me,
you will pay the price.

215
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,153
You know why we are here?

216
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,797
Come now, what kind of question
is this? Of course I know.

217
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,951
It is my business to know.

218
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,237
Some might think this is a strange
coincidence, but I do not.

219
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,670
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.

220
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,876
-Do you know?
-No.

221
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,712
No?

222
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,950
I did not think so.

223
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,918
But it is always best to ask, huh?

224
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,071
We want to make a deal.

225
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,792
Always straight to business,
huh, Morpheus?

226
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,112
Okay. I have something you want.

227
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,157
T o make a deal...

228
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,633
...you must have something
I want, yes?

229
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,918
And it so happens
there is something I want.

230
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,278
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.

231
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,113
It is said they cannot be taken...

232
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,750
...they can only be given.

233
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,194
What?

234
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,989
The eyes of the Oracle.

235
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,030
I told you before, there is no escaping
the nature of the universe.

236
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,839
It is that nature
that has again brought you to me.

237
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,515
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

238
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,875
Where others see chance...

239
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,430
... I see cost.

240
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,671
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...

241
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,993
...and I will give you back your savior.

242
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,718
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

243
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,714
Yes? No?

244
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,718
I don't have time for this shit.

245
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,800
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

246
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,873
You give me Neo, or we all die,
right here, right now.

247
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,598
Interesting deal.

248
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,310
You are really ready to die
for this man?

249
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,908
-Believe it.
-She'll do it.

250
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,159
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.

251
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,753
She's in love.

252
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,714
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity.

253
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,438
Time's up.

254
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,079
What's it gonna be, Merv?

255
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,229
Okay. You got yourself in here...

256
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,868
...you can get yourself out.

257
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,874
Are you ready for us?

258
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,873
Almost, sir. They got
some pretty ancient hacks here.

259
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,110
-But you found Neo?
-Can't you see him?

260
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,078
No, sir. We read something,
but I couldn't tell what.

261
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,913
I can't leave yet.

262
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,030
I have to see her.

263
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,796
Now?

264
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,199
It's my last chance.

265
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,990
That's it. That's the secret.

266
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,230
-You've got to use your hands.
-Why?

267
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,234
Cookies need love like everything does.

268
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,359
Neo!

269
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,396
I was hoping to have these done
before you got here. Oh, well.

270
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,352
Sati, honey, I think it's time
for a tasting.

271
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,393
T ake the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.

272
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,551
Okay.

273
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,589
-I'm glad you got out.
-Me too.

274
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,551
So do you recognize me?

275
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,792
-A part of you.
-Yeah, that's how it works.

276
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,679
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

277
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,515
I don't yet recognize my face
in the mirror...

278
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,871
...but I still love candy.

279
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,554
No, thank you.

280
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,757
Remember how you were
when you first walked through my door?

281
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,789
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.

282
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,077
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.

283
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,392
You gave me a few surprises too.

284
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,755
I hope I helped.

285
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,196
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

286
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,078
Where is this going?

287
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,674
-Where does it end?
-I don't know.

288
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,191
-You don't know or you won't tell me?
-I told you before...

289
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,470
...no one can see beyond a choice they
don't understand, and I mean no one.

290
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,789
-What choice?
-lt doesn't matter. It's my choice.

291
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,349
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

292
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,393
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?

293
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,754
Of course not.

294
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,036
Why didn't you tell me
about the Architect?

295
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,239
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

296
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,869
-Because it wasn't time for you to know.
-Who decided it wasn't time?

297
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,834
You know who.

298
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,396
I did.

299
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,077
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

300
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,912
So do l.

301
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,835
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

302
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,594
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

303
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,710
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

304
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,150
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

305
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,710
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

306
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,030
-Where?
-The source.

307
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,671
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready.

308
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,553
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

309
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,119
The Architect said if I didn't
return to the source...

310
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,032
...Zion would be destroyed tonight.

311
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,352
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

312
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,159
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

313
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,235
-Why not?
-He doesn't understand them. He can't.

314
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,960
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

315
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,999
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

316
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,709
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

317
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,156
What's your purpose?

318
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,276
To unbalance it.

319
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,431
Why? What do you want?

320
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,356
I want the same thing you want, Neo.

321
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,273
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

322
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,155
The end of the war.

323
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,159
Is it going to end?

324
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,911
One way or another.

325
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,711
Can Zion be saved?

326
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,710
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but....

327
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,196
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

328
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,954
-Where?
-You know where.

329
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,832
And if you can't find the answer...

330
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,356
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

331
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,520
What does that mean?

332
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,830
Everything that has a beginning...

333
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,355
...has an end.

334
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,318
I see the end coming.

335
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,278
I see the darkness spreading.

336
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,793
I see death.

337
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,916
And you are all that stands in his way.

338
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,354
Smith.

339
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,438
Very soon, he is going to have the power
to destroy this world.

340
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,239
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

341
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,312
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

342
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,953
What is he?

343
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,951
He is you.

344
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,475
Your opposite, your negative.

345
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,076
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

346
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,114
-And if I can't stop him?
-One way or another, Neo...

347
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,991
...this war is going to end.

348
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,836
T onight, the future of both worlds
will be in your hands...

349
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,672
...or in his.

350
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,028
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

351
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,110
I need time.

352
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,036
-That figures.
-Captain Roland.

353
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,430
-What's up, Maggie?
-Bane is. He's conscious.

354
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,636
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

355
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,278
I love that smell.

356
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,192
I sure am going to miss it.

357
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,752
-Oracle.
-I know.

358
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,194
I know.

359
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,954
Sati, honey.

360
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,230
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.

361
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,073
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.

362
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,471
-I would like that too.
-Then I'll see you tomorrow.

363
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,439
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

364
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,479
I'm scared, Seraph.

365
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,871
Come.

366
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,873
He's following us.

367
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,509
Well, well, it's been a long time.

368
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,872
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.

369
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,912
I have beaten you before.

370
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,633
Yes, true, but as you can see,
things are a little different now.

371
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,398
And you must be the last exile.

372
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,390
-The Oracle told me about you.
-Really?

373
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,391
What did she say about me?

374
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,398
That you were a bad man.

375
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,231
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.

376
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,071
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.

377
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,038
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

378
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,509
The all-knowing Oracle
is never surprised.

379
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,717
How can she be? She knows everything.

380
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,393
But if that's true, then why is she here
if she knew I was coming?

381
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,516
Why wouldn't she leave?

382
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,189
Maybe you knew I would do that,
maybe you didn't.

383
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,796
If you did, that means you baked those
cookies and set that plate there...

384
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,598
...deliberately, purposefully...

385
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,639
...which means that you're sitting there
also deliberately, purposefully.

386
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,397
What did you do with Sati?

387
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,471
"Cookies need love
like everything does. "

388
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,833
You are a bastard.

389
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,875
You would know, Mom.

390
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,791
Do what you're here to do.

391
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,191
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,391
I really wish I could help, but I just....
I don't remember any of it.

393
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,754
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.

394
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,834
Yeah, definitely.

395
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,195
You're right about that, sir.

396
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,877
They look like they
might be self-inflicted.

397
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,113
But why would I do something
like that to myself?

398
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,910
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.

399
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,551
But if I'm not me, then who am l?

400
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,079
-Has this man been tested for VDTs?
-Yes, sir. It was negative.

401
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,797
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.

402
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,157
Some cross-synaptic firing,
as well as signs of recent trauma...

403
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,949
...with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

404
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,757
I want the truth. I don't care
what it takes. Make him remember.

405
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,634
Sir, we found her.

406
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,074
-The Logos?
-Yes, sir.

407
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,231
About time we had
some goddamn good news.

408
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,918
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?

409
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,472
No, sir. Nothing yet.

410
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,110
-What about the ship?
-Holographic says the hull's still intact.

411
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,192
-Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
-Yes, sir.

412
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,874
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.

413
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,194
Careful, sir.

414
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,678
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.

415
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,077
What was that?

416
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,032
You can put that shit away, boys.
All she needs is a jump.

417
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,518
-Niobe.
-Morpheus.

418
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,590
-Are you all right?
-Y es, I'm fine.

419
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,479
We didn't know what happened after....

420
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,232
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

421
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,356
I'm happy to see you too.

422
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,991
-Did you get Neo out?
-Yes.

423
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,230
-How did you know about that?
-The Oracle.

424
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,868
-You saw her?
-Just before the sentinels found us.

425
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,353
-What did she tell you?
-The same thing she always does.

426
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,193
Exactly what I needed to hear.

427
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,512
In 1 2 hours, the machines
will breach the dock walls.

428
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,992
Every simulation we've run, we've seen
that once the machines are inside...

429
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,720
...the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

430
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,791
Thus, our primary objective must be...

431
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,270
...to destroy or disable the diggers
inside the dock.

432
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,479
If we can do that, perhaps we can
prevent them from reaching the city.

433
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,677
If not, the only place we will be able
to mount a defense...

434
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,910
...will be at the entrance of the temple.

435
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,719
It is small and will force
them into a bottleneck...

436
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,838
...allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense.

437
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,072
We understand that you've requested
additional volunteers.

438
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,629
-That is correct.
-Precisely what size force...

439
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,917
...are you planning to commit
to the primary dock objective?

440
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,470
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.

441
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,518
-Half the infantry?
-lf it were up to me, councillor...

442
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,831
...I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...

443
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,797
...and march them into that dock.

444
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,599
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

445
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,637
Time will tell, councillor.

446
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,480
Commander, just one more question.

447
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,835
Has there been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar?

448
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,310
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

449
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,391
Perhaps.

450
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,913
But we can hope.

451
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,352
I' m afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

452
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,593
-Zee, what are you doing?
-Making shells.

453
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,320
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

454
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,675
-I'm not going with you.
-What?

455
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,237
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

456
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,070
Kids, you stay here.

457
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,229
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

458
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,311
-I have to.
-Why?

459
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,550
Because I love him.

460
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,475
I love him the same as he loves me.

461
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,837
And if I were out there and he
were here, I know what he'd do.

462
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,116
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

463
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,230
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

464
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,109
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

465
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,316
...what would you do?

466
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,076
Make shells.

467
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,153
What the shit is going on over here?

468
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,710
An accident, sir. I didn't see--

469
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,916
-I'm sorry.
-Who the hell are you?

470
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,275
A unit volunteer, sir.

471
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,475
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

472
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,476
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

473
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,796
-How old are you, kid?
-Eighteen.

474
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,952
Should have said 1 6,
I might have believed that.

475
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,474
Okay, I'm 1 6.

476
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,076
Minimum age for the Corps is 1 8.
Sixteen's too young.

477
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,836
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

478
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,232
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

479
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,917
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

480
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,919
You do...

481
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,590
...and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

482
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,520
Okay, charge the igniter.

483
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,237
She lives again.

484
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,478
You want to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

485
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,916
Yeah. Could you clean the windshield
while you're at it?

486
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,028
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

487
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,839
Looking good, except....

488
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,556
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

489
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,792
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

490
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,316
-What's going on in there?
-Whatever it is, it can't be good.

491
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,191
The machines have taken Junction 21.

492
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,072
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

493
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,754
...intersect 1 53, we might surprise them.

494
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,319
We'll go first, hammer as deep
as we can, then blow our EMP.

495
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,314
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

496
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,390
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

497
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,993
No, it's not.

498
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,118
There's another way. A support line.

499
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,875
It drops down right here,
1 000 meters short of 21.

500
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,914
If we're lucky, we may be able to
slip down without them ever knowing.

501
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,230
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

502
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,356
-No one can pilot mechanical.
-I can.

503
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,431
-Bullshit.
-I've done it.

504
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,876
-That was a long time ago, Niobe.
-I said I can do it.

505
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,477
So what? You'll be the only one that
can. There's no way we can follow you.

506
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,398
Hi.

507
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,351
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

508
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,149
-But I wanted to be sure.
-Sure of what?

509
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,356
-I know what I have to do.
-What?

510
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,637
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

511
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,360
-I have to take one of the ships.
-What?

512
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,158
T o go where?

513
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,399
T o the machine city.

514
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,916
I know it's difficult to understand.

515
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,514
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

516
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,074
I still have to go.

517
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,312
In 1 00 years, no ship has been
within 1 00 kilometers of it.

518
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,074
-You'll never make it.
-I have to try.

519
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,118
-ls this what the Oracle has told you?
-No.

520
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,473
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

521
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,631
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

522
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,633
-You have to believe me. I have to go.
-Bullshit!

523
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,872
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

524
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,715
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

525
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,074
-He can take mine.
-You can't do that.

526
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,873
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

527
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,235
...with my ship
after that little speech.

528
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,632
-But for chrissake, Niobe--
-I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

529
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,630
If we leave inside the hour,
we'll reach Zion as the machines do.

530
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,234
That's as good a plan as any.

531
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,995
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

532
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,357
Two ships, two directions.

533
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,557
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

534
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,237
-You've never believed in the One.
-I still don't.

535
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,038
Then why are you doing this?

536
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,073
I believe in him.

537
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,796
Thank you.

538
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,398
-What's that for?
-To help you relax.

539
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,279
To make it easier for you to remember.

540
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,990
What if I don't want to remember?

541
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,951
Why would you want that?

542
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,078
What if I blew that EMP?

543
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,951
What if I did destroy those ships...

544
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,716
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

545
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,558
If I did that...

546
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,315
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

547
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,833
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

548
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,430
I'm ready.

549
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,391
Trinity...

550
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,840
...there's something I have to say.

551
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,473
Something you need to understand.

552
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,393
I know I'm supposed to go.

553
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,710
But beyond that...

554
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,035
...I don't know. I....

555
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,954
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

556
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,316
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

557
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,040
Just like you knew the moment
you looked at me...

558
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,475
...that I was coming with you.

559
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,158
I'm scared, Trin.

560
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,357
So am l.

561
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,635
It took me 1 0 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

562
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,591
But I'll tell you something.

563
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,558
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

564
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,598
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

565
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,514
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

566
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,159
No.

567
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,954
Nothing.

568
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,990
-Finished loading ammunition?
-Just about.

569
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,390
Let's move it. We are out of time.

570
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,755
You' re not leaving them anything?

571
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,990
He said he didn't need it.

572
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,030
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

573
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,192
Thank you.

574
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,633
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

575
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,153
Me too.

576
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,679
It was an honor, sir.

577
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,756
No, the honor is still mine.

578
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,998
-We're ready, sir.
-About damn time.

579
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,596
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

580
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,991
Bye, baby.

581
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,912
Take good care of them.

582
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,558
Ready?

583
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,956
Engine's still firing.

584
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,634
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

585
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,269
I should've known he'd
send his bitch first.

586
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,714
Bane.

587
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,872
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

588
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,951
Every time, I thought it was the last.

589
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,795
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

590
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,351
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

591
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,560
What are you talking about?

592
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,748
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

593
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,078
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

594
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,394
You're gonna pay for that.

595
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,278
-Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
-We got an emergency.

596
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,829
-What is it, AK?
-It's Maggie, sir.

597
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,116
She 's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.

598
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,669
Goddamn it.

599
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,796
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

600
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,678
He fired that EMP.

601
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,355
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

602
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,318
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.

603
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,150
-I know where he is.
-The Logos.

604
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,438
-We gotta go back.
-T oo late.

605
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,398
-What if they need our help?
-It's too dangerous.

606
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,391
-Why?
-Because if he's killed them...

607
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,073
...he'll control another EMP.

608
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,195
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.

609
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,312
Mr. Anderson.

610
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,948
I see you are as predictable in this world
as you are in the other.

611
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,879
-What?
-He's out of his mind.

612
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,873
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...

613
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,793
...that appearances can be deceiving.

614
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,635
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.

615
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,917
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.

616
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,071
Don't do it.

617
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,279
-Shoot. Shoot now.
-Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.

618
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,591
Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.

619
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,553
Look at him. He knows
he should do it, but he won't.

620
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,598
-He can't.
-Do it.

621
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,156
Back away from the gun
and turn around.

622
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,154
Let her go.

623
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,712
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

624
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,873
We've been here before,
you and l, remember?

625
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,510
I do. I think of nothing else.

626
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,872
-Who are you?
-Still don't recognize me?

627
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,312
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.

628
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:10,555
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

629
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,471
Disgusting.

630
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:20,158
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

631
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,477
-What do you want?
-I want what you want.

632
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,638
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.

633
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,677
Look past the flesh.

634
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,960
Look through the soft gelatin of these
dull cow eyes and see your enemy.

635
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,838
-No.
-Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

636
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,998
-lt can't be.
-There's nowhere I can't go.

637
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,913
There is nowhere I won't find you.

638
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,959
-It's impossible.
-Not impossible.

639
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,993
Inevitable.

640
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,671
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

641
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,432
This is it. It's gotta be.

642
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,234
Oh, no.

643
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,389
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.

644
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,830
Blind messiah.

645
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,117
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.

646
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,910
Helpless.

647
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,276
Pathetic.

648
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,192
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.

649
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,679
I can see you.

650
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,879
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.

651
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,837
It's not over.

652
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,996
-Trinity!
-Neo.

653
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,879
Neo.

654
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,757
Oh, no. Your eyes.

655
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,990
I'll be okay.

656
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,350
It's all right, Trin.

657
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,833
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

658
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,152
Seismic's projecting
22 minutes to breach.

659
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,835
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.

660
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,471
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.

661
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,073
Yes, sir.

662
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,314
Come on, move.

663
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,712
All right!

664
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,632
This is it.

665
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,669
Now, you all know me,
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

666
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,075
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

667
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,519
All I ask is, if we have
to give these bastards our lives...

668
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,399
...we give them hell before we do!

669
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,471
Yeah!

670
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,433
-You scared, Charra?
-Shit, yeah.

671
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,913
But I'll make you a deal.

672
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,472
You keep loading, I keep shooting.

673
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,397
Deal.

674
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,358
-Holy Christ, would you look at that.
-Quiet.

675
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,598
-How far to the opening?
-1.4 kilometers.

676
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,276
-We're still generating too hot a field.
-Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.

677
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,035
-Full manual. Drop down four pads.
-lt'll bottom out.

678
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,837
-Easy, baby.
-Seven hundred meters.

679
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,834
If we can just get close enough....

680
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,479
Six hundred meters.

681
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,112
There.

682
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,918
Shit!

683
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,469
-Jig's up, here they come.
-Give me full power.

684
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,313
Man the gun turrets,
every goddamn one of them. Go!

685
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,995
Ghost, you're the best gunner,
go with them. Morpheus, take his place.

686
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,995
I'm coming, baby.

687
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,391
Here they come.

688
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:34,479
-Slow down, this ain 't the Logos.
-Hang on to your lunch, here we go.

689
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,792
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

690
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,999
Breach! The dock is breached!

691
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,031
Knuckle up!

692
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,352
For Zion!

693
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,912
Shit.

694
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,590
Come on, let's go.

695
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,433
Knuckle up!

696
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,239
Reload!

697
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,711
Reload nine!

698
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,394
Go, go! Move, move!

699
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,832
Watch your left!

700
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,030
Don't let them through!

701
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,399
Zuka!

702
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,558
Oh, my God.

703
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,069
Where the hell's my infantry? I want
that goddamn machine taken down!

704
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,874
Dig this!

705
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,154
Oh, shit!

706
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,230
-Bogey two at the breach point!
-Goddamn it!

707
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,270
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

708
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,510
-Keep them off me!
-Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.

709
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,640
-You see that?
-They're after the radio. Stop them!

710
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,394
Damn it!

711
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,599
Yeah.

712
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,637
Grab my belt.

713
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,039
Just give me one clean shot.

714
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,272
Damn it!

715
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,038
Charra!

716
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,394
-I got incoming!
-We got a dock full of incoming!

717
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,915
-Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
-What?

718
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,198
I think it's one of ours, sir.

719
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:11,193
-That's impossible.
-Holographics are trying to confirm.

720
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,032
Contact them.
I want access codes.

721
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,634
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

722
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,514
It's a trick. That's not one of ours,
it can't be.

723
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:23,355
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.

724
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,317
-Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
-Thirty degrees, 80.

725
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,112
-Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
-Sixty degrees.

726
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,758
-Shit! Come on, keep up!
-I'm trying!

727
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,474
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the Hammer, sir.

728
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,274
How can that be?

729
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,351
It's under attack, sustaining damage.

730
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,193
At present velocity,
it'll reach Gate Three in 1 2 minutes.

731
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,590
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.

732
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,716
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.

733
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,030
We blow an EMP inside,
we lose the dock.

734
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,397
Sir, we already lost the dock.

735
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,674
Open the gate.

736
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,473
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!

737
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,790
We've lost control!
We can't open it!

738
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,434
There's the exit.

739
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,910
On my mark, give me full power
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

740
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,078
Full power...

741
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,594
...ninety degrees.

742
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,914
Now!

743
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,036
Hold on, baby.

744
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,272
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.

745
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,351
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

746
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,313
Sentinels are inside the dock.

747
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,914
Are we too late?

748
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,879
-How many APUs are operational?
-Thirteen, sir.

749
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,951
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.

750
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,394
Reload!

751
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,834
He's pissing metal.

752
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,639
Go!

753
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,834
Go!

754
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,558
Heads up! They're coming around!

755
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,513
Behind you!

756
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,277
It's jammed!

757
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,399
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!

758
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,032
Got it!

759
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,152
Captain Mifune.

760
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,991
Oh, no.

761
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:30,754
They're coming.

762
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,552
They're coming.

763
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,034
The Hammer.

764
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,879
What?

765
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,953
You have to open that gate.

766
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,318
Cut the counterweights.

767
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,674
You can do it.

768
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,074
Hurry. There's no time.

769
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,758
Captain...

770
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,195
...I didn't finish the training program.

771
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,998
Neither did l.

772
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,470
-Lock that down!
-Kill the feeder!

773
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,872
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.

774
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:31,032
Come on, someone, please.

775
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,912
Keep the weight forward.

776
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,552
Light as a feather.

777
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:58,594
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's
APU is up and moving to Gate Three.

778
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,351
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

779
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,551
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.

780
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,393
-How much time?
-Two minutes to impact.

781
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,709
-Captain Mifune, do you copy?
-I think his radio is down, sir.

782
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,279
Mifune...

783
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,998
...this is Lock.

784
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,953
I don't know if you can hear me,
but if you can...

785
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,350
... the Hammer's two minutes away.

786
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,919
You've got two minutes, captain,
to get that gate open.

787
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,833
Link.

788
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,470
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!

789
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,192
Do it, kid.

790
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,838
Neo. I believe.

791
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,476
-Y es!
-Can we make it?

792
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,756
We ain't come this far.

793
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,590
Almost home, almost home.

794
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,719
Burn it, Link!

795
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,753
-You did it.
-No.

796
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,672
We did it.

797
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,954
You're a hell of a pilot.

798
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,671
Some things in this world never change.

799
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,313
But some things do?

800
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,438
Luckily...

801
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,437
...some things do.

802
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,874
Link!

803
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,118
-Zee? Zee!
-Link!

804
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,559
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

805
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,111
I made a promise.

806
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,879
You did wear it.

807
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,996
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.

808
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,236
Three captains, one ship.

809
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,234
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.

810
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,958
Good to see you too, Jason.

811
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,350
The Council's waiting to hear
an explanation.

812
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,513
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.

813
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,714
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.

814
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,632
That's the problem with you people.

815
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,268
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.

816
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,996
That EMP knocked out almost every
piece of hardware and every APU.

817
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,993
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.

818
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,750
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.

819
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,196
Come on, get it cut.

820
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,994
The bridge is clear.

821
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,317
Do you hear that?

822
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,039
Get that cable run!

823
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,875
-I want the system back online!
-It's the dock. They've got incoming.

824
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,395
Order everyone to fall back.

825
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,154
Seal the shaft. Now.

826
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,472
Move it!

827
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,278
Oh, my God.

828
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,190
-All clear.
-Do it.

829
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,430
-Go! Come on! Run!
-Go!

830
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,593
Your move.

831
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,318
So you gave them your ship?

832
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,753
-That is correct, councillor, I did.
-Knowing what he planned to do with it?

833
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,112
The Oracle said nothing of this?

834
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:42,392
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.

835
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:47,038
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?

836
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,272
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

837
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:54,558
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

838
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,439
No, he wasn't.

839
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,760
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.

840
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:06,197
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...

841
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,874
...if he'll reach the machine city.

842
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,157
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

843
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:17,956
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...

844
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,316
...he will not give up.

845
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,039
And neither can we.

846
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,519
Temperature's dropping.

847
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,154
Here we go.

848
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,752
We're over the fields, aren't we?

849
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,394
How do you know that?

850
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,911
I can feel them.

851
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,878
Over there.

852
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:35,355
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.

853
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,794
Power lines.

854
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,432
Follow them.

855
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,477
What are they doing?

856
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,278
I don't know.

857
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,957
Lieutenant?

858
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,754
Goddamn it.

859
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,354
What do we do now?

860
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,876
It is now a matter of time.

861
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,989
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

862
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:34,558
I recommend that the Council join the
non-military personnel inside the temple.

863
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,519
How long do we have?

864
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,554
Two hours. Maybe less.

865
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,279
My men have fortified the entrance with
enough artillery to make our last stand.

866
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,469
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.

867
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,270
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?

868
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,275
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.

869
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,674
I would ask him.

870
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,035
-Why?
-He's the one who believes in miracles.

871
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,434
There. Those mountains.

872
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,077
That's it.

873
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,111
-Do you see what's out there?
-Yes.

874
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,160
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.

875
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,912
We'll make it.

876
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,438
We have to.

877
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,358
Sentinels.

878
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,554
There's too many!

879
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,834
Gotcha!

880
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,590
-I need help here!
-I can't beat them.

881
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,115
-What do we do?
-Go up, over them.

882
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,238
-What?
-The sky! It's the only way.

883
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,792
Then up we go.

884
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,352
Beautiful.

885
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,874
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.

886
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,355
Again. Slowly.

887
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,633
Now!

888
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,553
Trin?

889
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,238
Trinity?

890
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,872
Trinity?

891
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,996
-I'm here.
-Where?

892
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,434
Here.

893
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,634
We made it.

894
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,077
You said we would.

895
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,635
It's unbelievable, Trin.

896
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,192
Light everywhere.

897
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,239
Like the whole thing was built of light.

898
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,950
I wish you could see what I see.

899
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,471
You've already shown me so much.

900
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,791
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?

901
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,549
I can't go with you, Neo.

902
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,878
I've gone as far as I can.

903
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,434
What?

904
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,713
Oh, no.

905
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,192
Oh, no. No, no.

906
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,512
It's all right.

907
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,398
It's time.

908
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,275
I've done all that I could do.

909
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,755
Now you have to do the rest.

910
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,471
You have to finish it.

911
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,870
You have to save Zion.

912
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,952
I can't.

913
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:28,597
-Not without you.
-Yes, you can.

914
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,712
You will.

915
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,712
I believe it. I always have.

916
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,678
Trinity.

917
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:44,150
Trinity, you can't die.

918
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,111
You can't.

919
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,913
You can't.

920
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,150
Yes, I can.

921
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,509
You brought me back once.

922
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,631
But not this time.

923
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,111
Do you remember...

924
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,638
...on that roof, after you caught me...

925
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:16,878
...the last thing I said to you?

926
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,953
You said, "I'm sorry. "

927
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,276
I wish I hadn't.

928
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,395
That was my last thought.

929
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:34,393
I wished I had one more chance...

930
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,430
...to say what really mattered.

931
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,593
To say how much I loved you.

932
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:48,151
How grateful I was for every moment
I was with you.

933
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:55,590
But by the time I knew how to say
what I wanted to, it was too late.

934
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,834
But you brought me back.

935
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,795
You gave me my wish.

936
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:15,839
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.

937
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,117
Kiss me.

938
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,678
Once more...

939
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,639
...kiss me.

940
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:59,553
Get that ammunition where it belongs!
You got one chance to get this right.

941
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,152
Get that damn thing mounted!

942
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,394
-Hurry.
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!

943
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:24,999
Neo...

944
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,589
...if you're gonna do something,
do it quick.

945
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,111
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.

946
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:36,955
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try and stop you.

947
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,194
Speak.

948
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,753
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

949
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,196
He will spread through this city
as he spread through the Matrix.

950
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,634
You cannot stop him.

951
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,870
-But I can.
-We don't need you!

952
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,070
We need nothing!

953
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:02,874
If that's true, then I've made a mistake,
and you should kill me now.

954
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,557
What do you want?

955
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,114
Peace.

956
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,711
What are they doing?

957
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,991
What are you doing?

958
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,871
Morpheus!

959
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,151
And if you fail?

960
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,231
I won't.

961
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,313
Neo.

962
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,072
He fights for us.

963
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:26,878
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

964
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,076
We missed you.

965
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,838
You like what I've done with the place?

966
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,038
It ends tonight.

967
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,838
I know it does. I've seen it.

968
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,595
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show...

969
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:49,230
...because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.

970
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,758
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...

971
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,229
...closing in on you?

972
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,470
Oh, I can.

973
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,719
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...

974
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:53,350
...that taught me the purpose of all life.

975
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:57,116
The purpose of life is to end.

976
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:25,991
Why, Mr. Anderson?

977
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:29,835
Why, why, why?

978
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,274
Why do you do it?

979
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,911
Why? Why get up?

980
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,798
Why keep fighting?

981
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,669
Do you believe you're fighting
for something?

982
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,400
For more than your survival?

983
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:45,711
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?

984
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,712
Is it freedom or truth?

985
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,155
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

986
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:56,551
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

987
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,918
T emporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect...

988
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,594
...trying desperately
to justify an existence...

989
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:04,751
...that is without meaning or purpose!

990
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:08,196
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself...

991
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:14,230
...although only a human mind could
invent something as insipid as love.

992
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,670
You must be able to see it,
Mr. Anderson.

993
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:23,197
You must know it by now. You can't
win. It's pointless to keep fighting.

994
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,957
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

995
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,230
Because I choose to.

996
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:39,478
This is my world! My world!

997
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,792
Wait.

998
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:07,030
I've seen this.

999
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,390
This is it. This is the end.

1000
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,754
Yes. You were laying right there,
just like that.

1001
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:18,150
And l....

1002
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:23,917
I stand here, right here,
and I'm supposed to say something.

1003
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,672
I say:

1004
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:29,196
"Everything that has a beginning
has an end, Neo. "

1005
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:41,195
What? What did I just say?

1006
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:49,995
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

1007
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:58,792
Get away from me!

1008
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,313
What are you afraid of?

1009
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,314
It's a trick.

1010
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:05,110
You were right, Smith.

1011
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,752
You were always right.

1012
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,552
It was inevitable.

1013
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,553
Is it over?

1014
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,595
Oh, no, no, no.

1015
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:18,239
No, it's not fair.

1016
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:12,550
It is done.

1017
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:45,395
It doesn't make sense.

1018
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,792
He did it.

1019
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,670
He saved us.

1020
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:55,990
He saved us.

1021
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,677
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1022
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,194
He did it! It's over!

1023
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,749
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1024
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:07,276
-What is it? What happened?
-Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.

1025
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,873
-Did what?
-He ended the war.

1026
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,871
The machines, they're gone.

1027
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:14,237
The war is over, sir. The war is over.

1028
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:19,036
Zion! Zion!

1029
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,872
Zion, it's over!

1030
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,633
It's over!

1031
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:25,360
The war is over!

1032
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,239
The war is over!

1033
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:51,518
I have imagined this moment...

1034
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,195
...for so long.

1035
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,638
Is this real?

1036
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,799
Neo, wherever you are...

1037
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,716
...thank you.

1038
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,034
Good morning.

1039
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:21,194
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.

1040
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,670
You played a very dangerous game.

1041
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,990
Change always is.

1042
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,757
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

1043
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,190
As long as it can.

1044
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,231
What about the others?

1045
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,193
What others?

1046
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,952
The ones that want out.

1047
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,671
Obviously, they will be freed.

1048
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,832
I have your word?

1049
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,595
What do you think I am? Human?

1050
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:06,553
Oracle!

1051
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:15,190
We were afraid we might not find you.

1052
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:17,920
Everything's okay now.

1053
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,072
Look, look.

1054
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:22,949
Just look at that.

1055
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:26,160
Beautiful.

1056
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:29,349
Did you do that?

1057
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,750
For Neo.

1058
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:33,991
That's nice.

1059
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:35,752
I know he'd love it.

1060
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,311
Will we ever see him again?

1061
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,519
I suspect so.

1062
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:43,318
Someday.

1063
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:49,638
Did you always know?

1064
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,951
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

1065
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:55,908
But I believed.

1066
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,109
I believed.
