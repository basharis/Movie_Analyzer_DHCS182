1
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,599
Copy boy!

2
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,504
- Make it snappy.
- Where's the rest of this story?

3
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:12,933
<i>Morning Post.</i>

4
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,802
City desk? Just a moment
and I'll connect you.

5
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,840
If anybody asks for me,
I'm down at the courthouse.

6
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,147
- Elevator!
- Going down.

7
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,453
- Hello, Hildy.
- Hi, Skinny.

8
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,556
Hello, Ruth, Maisie.

9
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,850
- Is the lord of the universe in?
- Yes, in a bad humor.

10
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,586
Somebody must've stolen
the crown jewel.

11
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,265
- Shall we announce you?
- I'll blow my own horn.

12
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,626
Bruce, wait here.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

13
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:46,170
Even ten minutes is a long time
to be away from you.

14
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,440
What did you say?

15
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,206
Go on.

16
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,380
Well, go ahead.

17
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,984
I just said, "Even ten minutes is
a long time to be away from you".

18
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:02,121
I heard you. I like it.
That's why I asked you to say it again.

19
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,517
I like being spoiled.

20
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,192
The man I'm going in to see
did little spoiling.

21
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,918
I'd like to spoil him.
Want me to go with you?

22
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,530
- I can handle it.
- Lf it gets rough, I'm here.

23
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,666
I'll come running, partner.

24
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,167
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Hildy!

25
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,631
- How are you?
- Welcome back.

26
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,000
Hello, Hildy, how have you been?

27
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,040
Beatrice, how's
"Advice to the Lovelorn"?

28
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:28,044
- Fine. My cat had kittens again.
- Your own fault.

29
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,580
Glad to see you. Hi, Jim.

30
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,649
Mildred, you still around?

31
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,046
A little more around the chin, boss.

32
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,691
What do you want?

33
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,760
Your ex-wife is here.

34
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,563
Hello, Hildy.

35
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,255
Hello, Walter.

36
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,635
Hello, Louie.
How's the big slot machine king?

37
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,204
I ain't doing that no more.
I'm retired. You know what I mean?

38
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,102
- Walter.
- I'm busy!

39
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,834
The governor didn't sign
that reprieve.

40
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,106
Tomorrow, Earl Williams dies
and makes a sucker out of us.

41
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,942
What are you going to do?

42
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,312
- Phone the governor.
- I can't.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,545
- Why not?
- He's out fishing.

44
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:12,192
- How many places are there?
- At least two, Atlantic and Pacific.

45
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:13,985
That simplifies it, doesn't it?

46
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,685
- Get him on the phone.
- And say what?

47
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,955
Quiet, Duffy. He's thinking.

48
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:22,163
Tell him if he reprieves Earl Williams,
we'll support him for senator.

49
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,462
<i>Tell him the Morning Post
will be behind him.</i>

50
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:25,764
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

51
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,373
We've been a Democratic paper
for over 20 years.

52
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,568
After we get the reprieve,
we'll be Democratic again.

53
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,138
Go on, Duffy, get going.

54
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,316
<i>The Morning Post expects
every editor to do his duty.</i>

55
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,042
You too, Louie.
Get out of here.

56
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,258
Well, Walter,
I see you're still at it.

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,554
First time I double-crossed a governor.
What can I do for you?

58
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,458
Would you mind if I sat down?

59
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,566
There's a lamp burning in the
window for you. Here.

60
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,760
I jumped out of that window
a long time ago, Walter.

61
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,971
May I have one of those?

62
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,303
Thank you.

63
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,678
And a match?

64
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,875
Thank you.

65
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,948
- How long is it?
- How long is what?

66
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,251
You know what.

67
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,827
How long is it since
we've seen each other?

68
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,789
Well, let's see.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,061
I spent six weeks in Reno,
then Bermuda. About four months.

70
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,670
Seems like yesterday to me.

71
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:36,465
Maybe it was yesterday, Hildy.
Been seeing me in your dreams?

72
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,770
Mama doesn't dream about you.
You wouldn't know her now.

73
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,141
Yes, I would.
I'd know you anytime.

74
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,442
Any place, anywhere.

75
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,621
You're repeating yourself.
You said that the night you proposed.

76
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,083
You still remember it.

77
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,157
If I didn't remember it,
I wouldn't have divorced you.

78
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,724
I sort of wish you hadn't.

79
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,918
- What?
- Divorced me.

80
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,997
It makes a fellow lose faith
in himself. It gives him...

81
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,723
...a feeling he wasn't wanted.

82
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,129
Junior, that's what divorces are for.

83
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:06,602
Nonsense, you've got an old-fashioned
idea divorces last forever.

84
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,265
"Till death do us part".
Divorce doesn't mean anything nowadays.

85
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,037
Just a few words mumbled
over you by a judge.

86
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,875
We've got something between us
nothing can change.

87
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,849
- I suppose you're right in a way.
- Sure, I'm right.

88
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,921
- I am fond of you, you know.
- Thattagirl!

89
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,614
I often wish you weren't
such a stinker.

90
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,487
You must meet my mother.
She'd like that phrase.

91
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:34,396
Then why'd you promise not to fight
the divorce and then gum up the works?

92
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,728
I meant to let you go,
but you know...

93
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,167
...you never miss the water
till the well runs dry.

94
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:42,240
A big lummox like you,
hiring an airplane to write:

95
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:46,470
"Hildy, don't be hasty.
Remember my dimple. Walter".

96
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,171
It delayed our divorce
while the judge watched it.

97
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:53,444
Not to brag, but I've still got
the dimple, and in the same place.

98
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,817
I acted like any husband who didn't
want to see his home broken up.

99
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,754
- What home?
- Remember the home I promised you?

100
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,862
Sure I do. The one we were to
have right after the honeymoon.

101
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,326
That honeymoon!

102
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:09,024
Was it my fault? Did I know that
coal mine would have a cave-in?

103
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,000
I intended to be with you
on our honeymoon.

104
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,471
Instead of two weeks in Atlantic City
with my bridegroom...

105
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,770
...I spent two weeks in a coal mine
with John Kruptzky.

106
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:19,979
You don't deny it?

107
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,981
No. We beat the whole country
on that story!

108
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,152
Suppose we did!
That isn't what I got married for!

109
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,617
What is the good?
Look, Walter.

110
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:33,054
I came to tell you to stop
phoning me a dozen times a day...

111
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,260
...sending me 20 telegrams...

112
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,554
I write a beautiful telegram, don't I?

113
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,231
Are you going to listen?

114
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,060
What's the use of fighting?
I'll tell you what you do.

115
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,601
Come back to work on the paper,
and if we can't get along...

116
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,602
...we'll get married again.

117
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,571
- What?
- Sure, I haven't any hard feelings.

118
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,974
Walter, you're wonderful
in a loathsome sort of way.

119
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,445
- Be quiet so I can say what I have to.
- Tell me over lunch.

120
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,141
I have a lunch date.

121
00:06:58,352 --> 00:06:59,478
- Break it.
- I can't.

122
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,711
Hands off!
Are you playing osteopath?

123
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,150
Temper, temper.

124
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:07,657
You are no longer my husband
and no longer my boss.

125
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,192
And you won't be my boss.

126
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,796
- What does that mean?
- Just what I say.

127
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,591
You're not coming back to work?

128
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,269
You're right for
the first time today.

129
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,967
- Got a better offer?
- You bet!

130
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:22,233
Work for somebody else!
That's the gratitude I get.

131
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:23,467
Stop hamming.

132
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:27,773
Five years ago, you were a college girl.
I took a doll-faced hick!

133
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,539
You wouldn't have
if I wasn't doll-faced.

134
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,151
It was a novelty to have a face
to look at without shuddering.

135
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:36,914
I made you a great reporter.
You won't be as good on any other paper.

136
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,957
We're a team.
The paper needs both of us!

137
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,627
Sold American!

138
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,491
- All right, go ahead.
- Listen, Walter, please.

139
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:48,134
The paper's going to have to get along
without me. So will you.

140
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:49,495
It didn't work out.

141
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:53,662
It would have worked if you'd been
satisfied as editor and reporter.

142
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,933
You had to marry me
and spoil everything.

143
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,306
I wasn't satisfied?
I suppose I proposed to you!

144
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,276
Practically!
Making eyes at me until I broke down.

145
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:05,919
"Oh, Walter!"
I was tight when I proposed to you.

146
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,883
If you'd been a gentleman,
you'd have forgotten about it.

147
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,489
You used to pitch better than that.

148
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,660
Hello. What?

149
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,852
Sweeney? What can I do for you?

150
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,827
What? Wait a minute.
I'm not Sweeney. I'm Duffy.

151
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:22,001
Sweeney, you can't do that to me.
Not today, of all days!

152
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,564
What's the matter with you?
Are you a loony?

153
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,734
Now, listen, Sweeney.
This is no time...

154
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,909
All right, I suppose so.
If you have to, you have to.

155
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,481
- He had to.
- Everything happens to me.

156
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,812
365 days in a year,
and this has to be the day.

157
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,021
What's wrong?

158
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,317
- Sweeney.
- Dead?

159
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:47,187
He might as well be.
He picks today to have a baby!

160
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,656
Not on purpose?

161
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,025
He's supposed to cover the
Earl Williams case, and where is he?

162
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,360
Walking up and down in a hospital.
Is there no honor?

163
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,161
Haven't you got anybody else?

164
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,299
Nobody else on the paper can write.

165
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,667
This'll break me.

166
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,875
Unless...

167
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,200
Hildy!

168
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,370
- You've got to help me.
- Not a chance, Walter.

169
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,139
Get out of here, Duffy!

170
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,349
Save your breath.

171
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,181
This'll bring us back together again.

172
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,183
That's what I'm afraid of.

173
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,515
This is bigger than anything else.

174
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,723
Do it for the paper.

175
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,017
Scram, Svengali.

176
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,387
If you won't do it for love,
how about money?

177
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,062
I'll raise you $25 a week.

178
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,628
Listen to me, you baboon...

179
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,594
I'll make it $35
and not a cent more.

180
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,960
Listen!

181
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,658
How much will the other paper pay?

182
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,928
There's no other paper.

183
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:34,164
Then the raise is off.
You go back to your old salary.

184
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,103
Trying to blackjack me.

185
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,902
- I'm busy.
- Take a good look at it.

186
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,875
Do you know what it is?
It's an engagement ring.

187
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,444
Engagement ring?

188
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,446
I tried to tell you right away...

189
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,750
...but you would start reminiscing.

190
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,854
I'm getting married,
and I'm getting as far away...

191
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,691
...from the newspaper business
as I can get.

192
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,427
I'm through.

193
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,934
- You can get married, but not quit.
- No? Why not?

194
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,765
I know what quitting would mean.

195
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,874
- What?
- It would kill you.

196
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:12,375
- You can't sell me that.
- You're a newspaperman.

197
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,275
I want to go someplace
where I can be a woman.

198
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,712
- You mean, be a traitor.
- A traitor to what?

199
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,783
To journalism.
You're a journalist!

200
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,353
A journalist?
What does that mean?

201
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,320
Peeking through keyholes,
chasing fire engines...

202
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,119
...waking people up
in the night to ask questions...

203
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,820
...stealing pictures off old ladies?
I know all about reporters.

204
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,694
Buttinskies running around
with no money, and for what?

205
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:39,497
So a million people will know
what's going on. Why, I...

206
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,571
What's the use?

207
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,039
Walter, you wouldn't know
what it means...

208
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:48,180
...to want to be respectable and
live a halfway normal life.

209
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:52,085
The point is, I'm through.

210
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,552
Where did you meet this man?

211
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:56,756
Bermuda.

212
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:57,949
Rich?

213
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,616
He's not what you'd call rich.
He makes about $5000 a year.

214
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,490
- What's his line?
- He's in the insurance business.

215
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,290
Insurance business?

216
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,899
That's a good honest business.

217
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,036
Sure, it's honest.
It's also adventurous, romantic.

218
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:14,730
I can't picture you
being surrounded by policies...

219
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,739
I can, and I like it, what's more.

220
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,378
Besides, he forgets the office
when he's with me.

221
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,548
He doesn't treat me
like an errand boy.

222
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:23,909
He treats me like a woman.

223
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:27,052
He does? How did I treat you?
Like a water buffalo?

224
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,121
I don't know from buffaloes,
but I do know about him.

225
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,553
He's kind, he's sweet,
and he's considerate.

226
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,784
He wants a home and children.

227
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,691
Sounds like a guy I ought to marry.
What's his name?

228
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,897
Baldwin. Bruce Baldwin.

229
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,159
I knew a Baldwin once,
a horse thief.

230
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,269
Couldn't be the same fellow,
could it?

231
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,929
You are not talking about the man
I'm marrying tomorrow.

232
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,408
Tomorrow? As soon as that?

233
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,879
At last, I got out what
I came up here to tell you.

234
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,689
Guess there isn't any more
to the story.

235
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:05,886
So long, Walter.

236
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,390
So long, Hildy.

237
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,221
Better luck to you next time.

238
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,021
Thanks.

239
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:19,103
Well, you kind of took
the wind out of my sail.

240
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:22,969
I just want to wish you
everything I couldn't give you.

241
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:29,608
This other fellow. I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to see him.

242
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:33,013
I'm particular about
whom my wife marries.

243
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,514
Where is he?

244
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,884
He's right on the job,
waiting for me out there.

245
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,956
Do you mind if I meet him?

246
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,220
- It wouldn't do any good.
- You're not afraid, are you?

247
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,430
Of course not.

248
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:48,295
Let's see this paragon.
Is he as good as you say?

249
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,502
He's better.

250
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,797
- Then what does he want with you?
- You got me.

251
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,997
Back in an hour, Mildred.

252
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,438
I am sorry, Hildy.
I suppose Bruce... What's his name?

253
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,111
I suppose he opens doors for you?

254
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,576
And with a lady,
he takes his hat off.

255
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,147
I am sorry.

256
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,475
When he walks with a lady,
he waits for her.

257
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,880
In that case...

258
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,954
Allow me.

259
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:17,194
I can see my wife picked out
the right husband for herself.

260
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,927
There must be some mistake.
I'm already married.

261
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,692
Already married?

262
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,565
You should have told me.

263
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,637
Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin.

264
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:28,967
- No, my name...
- Mr. Burns.

265
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,077
I'm terribly busy.
What did you say, Mr. Baldwin?

266
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,042
- Mr. Burns.
- My name is...

267
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,410
I'm busy with Mr. Baldwin.
I didn't hear what you said, sir.

268
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,278
- My name is...
- Mr. Burns...

269
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,477
- What is it with you?
- I'm Bruce Baldwin.

270
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,986
Can't you see that I'm...
You're Bruce Baldwin!

271
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,624
Well, who is he?
Who are you?

272
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,453
My name's Pete Davis.

273
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,095
Mr. Davis, is this
any concern of yours?

274
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,788
From now on, keep your nose
out of my affairs.

275
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,762
Don't let it happen again.

276
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:59,098
I'm terribly sorry about this mistake.
This is indeed a pleasure.

277
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:03,436
That's wrong, isn't it? Bruce...
do you mind if I call you Bruce?

278
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,373
- We're almost related.
- No, not at all.

279
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,048
You see, my wife...
That is, your wife.

280
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,582
Hildy, you led me to expect you
were marrying a much older man.

281
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,651
What did I say?

282
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:18,848
Don't worry about it. I realize
you didn't mean old in years.

283
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:23,193
- Do you always carry an umbrella?
- It looked cloudy this morning.

284
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,227
That's right.
Rubbers too, I hope.

285
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,623
Thattaboy!
A man ought to be prepared.

286
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,302
We'd better run along.

287
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,266
- We'd better go.
- Where are we going?

288
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,463
I'm taking you two to lunch.
Didn't you tell him?

289
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:35,936
No, she didn't.

290
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,509
I guess she just wanted
to surprise you, Bruce.

291
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,713
After you, Hildy.

292
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,678
You're wasting your time.

293
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,443
No, I'm glad to do it.

294
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,846
Hello, Gus.

295
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,217
It's Hildy!

296
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,120
It's none other.
How are things?

297
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,351
I can't complain.

298
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,587
I can. I'm hungry.
A roast beef sandwich...

299
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,321
- Sorry.
- ...on white bread.

300
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,863
Over there, Bruce.

301
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,297
- And you, Hildy?
- I'll have the same.

302
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,063
- And you, sir?
- Yes, that's all right for me.

303
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,798
Bring some mustard too, Gus.

304
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,710
So you two are going to get married?

305
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,712
- How does it feel, Bruce?
- It feels awful good.

306
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,441
You're getting a great girl.

307
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,085
I realize that.

308
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,482
Things have been different
since I met Hildy.

309
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,919
I've never met anyone quite like her.

310
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,922
Everybody else I've ever known...

311
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,995
...you could always tell ahead of time
what they would say or do.

312
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,928
But Hildy's not like that.
You can't tell that about her.

313
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,261
That's nice.

314
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,131
You're getting something else too:
A great newspaperman.

315
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,636
No orchids, Walter.

316
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,571
One of the best I ever knew.
Sorry to see her go. Darn sorry.

317
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,370
I'd like to believe you.

318
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,047
I mean it.
If you ever want to come back...

319
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,876
Which I won't.

320
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:54,451
In spite of everything,
there's only one man I'd work for.

321
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,815
I'd kill you if you
worked for anybody else.

322
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,684
Hear that? That's my diploma.

323
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:01,520
It must be quite a business if it's...

324
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,525
Are you sure you want to quit?

325
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,025
What do you mean?

326
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,892
If there is any doubt about it...

327
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,499
...or if there's anything...

328
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:10,897
No, this is your chance
to have a home...

329
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,436
...and to be, like you said,
a human being.

330
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,073
I'll make you take that chance.

331
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,869
Certainly.
Why, I wouldn't let her stay.

332
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,412
She deserves all this happiness.
All the things I couldn't give her.

333
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,276
All she ever wanted was a home.

334
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,281
I'll certainly try.

335
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,680
I know you will, Bruce.

336
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,149
- Where will you live?
- Albany.

337
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:32,325
- Got a family up there?
- Just my mother.

338
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:35,050
Just your mother.
You're going to live with her?

339
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,354
Just for the first year.

340
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,792
That will be nice.

341
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,765
Yes, a home with mother,
in Albany too.

342
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,598
Mighty nice little town.
It's the state capital.

343
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,639
I know. We were there once.

344
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:56,712
Will you ever forget the night
you brought the governor to the hotel?

345
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,111
You see, I was in taking a bath.

346
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,844
Well, I came walking out without...

347
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,623
She didn't know I was in town.

348
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,851
Bruce, how is business up there?
Any better?

349
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,155
Albany's a mighty
good insurance town.

350
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,730
Most people take it out
pretty early in life.

351
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,798
I can see why they would.

352
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,560
Statistics show that most of...

353
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:21,207
I've got a feeling I ought to
have taken out a little insurance.

354
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,434
That really doesn't matter
now that Hildy and I have...

355
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,145
...well, you know, we've...
Does it?

356
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,712
What do you think?

357
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:32,043
It might have been a good idea
if I had taken out insurance.

358
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,879
I honestly feel that way.

359
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,749
I'm in one business
that really helps people.

360
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,221
Of course, we don't help you much
while you're alive, but afterward.

361
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,987
- That's what counts.
- Sure.

362
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,161
I don't get it.

363
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,366
Nice going.

364
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,731
So sorry, Gus.
My foot must have slipped.

365
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,234
That's all right.
What would you like to drink?

366
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,439
Coffee.

367
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,703
- Shall I put some rum in the coffee?
- Sure.

368
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,342
Me too, Gus, please.

369
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,269
- Not for me.
- Go on, Bruce.

370
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:03,074
I have a lot to do. I have to
buy the tickets, check the baggage...

371
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,443
Do it tomorrow.

372
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:08,678
We're leaving today at four o'clock,
taking the sleeper for Albany.

373
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,523
You're leaving today
at four o'clock?

374
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,126
- That's only two hours.
- That's not much time.

375
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,024
I've got a lot to do.
I want to...

376
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:21,064
Isn't that silly?
All down over my front.

377
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,327
- That's nothing new. Here.
- Never mind, I'll get Gus.

378
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,801
Gus, do something
about this, will you?

379
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,804
Call me to the telephone when
I get back to the table.

380
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,603
Thanks, Gus, that's fine.

381
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,747
I'm terribly sorry about that.
That was silly, wasn't it?

382
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,146
Let me get that straight.
I must have misunderstood you.

383
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,651
You're taking the sleeper today,
then getting married tomorrow?

384
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,949
Well, it's not like that.

385
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:46,158
What is it like?

386
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,350
Poor Walter.
He'll toss and turn all night.

387
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,052
Perhaps we'd better tell him.
Mother's coming too.

388
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,095
Your mother kicked the bucket...

389
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,459
No, my mother.

390
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,261
Your mother?
Well, that relieves my mind.

391
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,335
It was cruel to let you suffer so.

392
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,973
Isn't Walter sweet?
Always wanting to protect me.

393
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:05,633
I admit I wasn't much of a husband,
but you can always count on me.

394
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:09,713
I don't think she'll need you much.
I aim to do the protecting myself.

395
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,713
Mr. Burns, telephone.

396
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,146
For me?

397
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,650
That's strange.

398
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,417
Pardon me.

399
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,654
He's not such a bad fellow.

400
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,828
No, he should make
some girl real happy.

401
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,088
Slaphappy.

402
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,227
He's not the man for you.
I can see that.

403
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,595
But I sort of like him.
He's got charm.

404
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,738
He comes by it naturally.
His grandfather was a snake.

405
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,402
Hello? Duffy, listen.

406
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,546
Any way we can stop the 4:00 train
to Albany from leaving?

407
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:44,273
<i>- We might dynamite it.
- Could we?</i>

408
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,349
Maybe we couldn't.

409
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:47,611
All right, get this.

410
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,483
Send Sweeney out of town on
two weeks' vacation right away.

411
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,626
Keep your shirt on.
Hildy's coming back.

412
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,159
She doesn't know it yet,
but she's staying.

413
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,129
Tell Louie to stick around the office.
I may need him. Goodbye.

414
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,130
Thanks, Gus.

415
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,237
- This is bad business.
- What's the matter?

416
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,770
The Earl Williams case.

417
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,407
I've been reading about that.

418
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,609
It's pretty bad.

419
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,770
- What is the lowdown on it?
- Simple, honey.

420
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,777
Poor little dope lost his job,
went berserk and shot a cop...

421
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,542
...who was coming to quiet him down.
They'll hang him tomorrow.

422
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,775
What a shame.

423
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,216
Your paper has been taking his side.

424
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,823
If he was out of his mind, why doesn't
the state just put him away?

425
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,188
Because it was a colored policeman.
You know what that means.

426
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,987
The colored vote's important.

427
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:33,256
Especially with an election
in three or four days.

428
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,128
That mayor would hang his
grandmother to be reelected.

429
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,531
You could show the man
wasn't responsible.

430
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,137
That's not so easy.

431
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,700
Maybe it isn't so hard either.

432
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,376
What do you mean, Hildy?

433
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,239
Doesn't an expert have to
examine him before they hang him?

434
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,507
A bird named Egelhoffer is doing it.
He'll say the same as the rest.

435
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:51,877
Suppose he does.

436
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,109
What's your scheme?

437
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,913
Walter, you get the interview
with Earl Williams.

438
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,555
Print Egelhoffer's statement.

439
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:01,318
And right alongside it, double column,
run your interview.

440
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,961
Alienist says he's sane.
Interview shows he's goofy.

441
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,631
You could save that poor devil's life.

442
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:07,993
You could...

443
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,162
- You're going away. I forgot.
- How long would the interview take?

444
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,772
An hour for the interview.
An hour to write it.

445
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:18,307
We could take the 6 o'clock train
if it'd save a man's life.

446
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,537
No, Bruce. If you want to save
Earl Williams' life...

447
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,012
...write it yourself.
You're a good reporter.

448
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:27,482
I can't write that kind of thing.
It takes a woman's touch.

449
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,587
Don't get poetic.
Get Sweeney.

450
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,280
He's the best man for that
sob-sister stuff.

451
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:36,087
Poor Sweeney. Duffy just told me
his wife finally had twins.

452
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,296
Isn't that terrible?

453
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,863
Sweeney went out to celebrate
and now we can't find him.

454
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,591
So Sweeney has twins
and Williams gets hanged.

455
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:43,962
Now, Walter, look.

456
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,901
Argue with her, or you'll be on
a honeymoon with blood on your hands.

457
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,870
How can you be happy after that?

458
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:52,806
You'll remember that
a man went to the gallows...

459
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,207
...because she was too selfish
to wait two hours.

460
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:58,213
Earl Williams' face will come
between you tonight...

461
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,147
...and the rest of your life.

462
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,787
Stop it, Walter.
The whole place will hear you.

463
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,581
What an act.

464
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:08,591
I just remembered Sweeney was only
married four months ago.

465
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,562
Hildy, you win. I'm licked.

466
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,634
Then Mrs. Sweeney didn't have twins?

467
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,601
No, indeed. The twins were
Walter's, all his.

468
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,468
It was nothing.

469
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,199
Well, come on, let's forget it.

470
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,672
We'll start over again.

471
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,812
- I'll offer a business proposition.
- Not interested.

472
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,345
You'll be interested.

473
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,540
Don't listen to him.
I know him from way back.

474
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:35,653
Excuse me, will you? I'm talking
to him. Now, look, Bruce...

475
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,347
...persuade her and you can
write an insurance policy for me.

476
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,756
No, Mr. Burns. I wouldn't use
my wife for business purposes.

477
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,190
Wait a minute, Bruce.

478
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,489
- How big a policy?
- 25,000.

479
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,699
Fifty thousand.

480
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,494
What's the commission on
a $100,000 policy?

481
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,296
- Around $1000, but Hildy...
- And what's wrong with $1000?

482
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,132
- I couldn't...
- We could use that money.

483
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,898
How long would it take
to get him examined?

484
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,077
I could get a company doctor
here in 20 minutes.

485
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,404
- Get him. Get him.
- You keep out of this.

486
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:03,741
Suppose you have Mr. Burns examined
over in his office...

487
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,680
...and see what they'll allow
on that old carcass of his.

488
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,344
- I'm better than I ever was.
- That's nothing to brag about.

489
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:14,458
I'll go back and change and after
you get the check, phone me.

490
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,094
I'll be in the press room
at the criminal courts building.

491
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:20,857
Oh, Walter? I think you better
make that a certified check.

492
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,159
Think I'm a crook?

493
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,598
Yes. No certified check,
no story. Get me?

494
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,203
It'll be certified.
Want my fingerprints?

495
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,964
No, thanks. I've still got those.

496
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,108
Gus, how much do I owe you?

497
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:32,610
Thank you, dear.

498
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,112
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- How much money have you got?

499
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,146
You know, everything we have, $500.

500
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:40,182
- Give me it.
- I have to buy the tickets.

501
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:43,822
I'll buy the tickets. Believe me,
he'll get you in a crap game.

502
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,251
Hildy, I don't gamble.

503
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:49,053
I know people that never did anything
till they met Walter Burns.

504
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,787
But remember, it's everything we have.

505
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:52,998
I know.

506
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,534
- You got change of ten?
- See what I mean, don't you, Bruce?

507
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:59,261
I just gave everything to Hildy.
All I've got left...

508
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,303
- Come on, Hildy.
- Not me. Sign it.

509
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,099
All right.

510
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,468
For the waiter.

511
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,037
Come on, Bruce. Really.

512
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:13,609
I'll open for a dime.

513
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
I'm in.

514
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,147
I'll stay.

515
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,845
Wilcox 3400.

516
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,490
- How many?
- Two.

517
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,952
Take that, one of you birds.
You ain't doing anything, Ernie.

518
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:27,126
What's the matter with you guys?
Crippled or something?

519
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,698
I'll just bet 20 cents.

520
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,960
Press room. Wait a minute.

521
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,298
Hello, Sarge, McCue talking.
Hold the line, will you? What?

522
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:37,635
I told you this is the press room
of the criminal courts building.

523
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:39,368
Jake, new lead on the hanging.

524
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:43,015
This alienist from New York,
Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer.

525
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:46,947
He's interviewing Williams in about
half an hour in the sheriff's office.

526
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,451
Must be the tenth alienist
they've put on Williams.

527
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,520
If he wasn't crazy,
he would be by the time...

528
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,557
...ten of those babies got through
psychoanalyzing him.

529
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,293
- Is this guy Egelhoffer any good?
- You figure it out.

530
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,830
He's the guy they sent to Washington
to interview the Brain Trust.

531
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,500
He said they were sane.

532
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,363
Here's the situation
on the eve of the hanging.

533
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,638
I'll pick up a little fudge. This is Murphy.
More slop on the hanging.

534
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,571
A double guard has been thrown around
the jail, municipal buildings...

535
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,369
...railroad terminals,
and elevated stations...

536
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,672
...to prepare for the expected
general uprising...

537
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,679
...of radicals at the hour of execution.

538
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,478
The sheriff has put 200 more
relatives on the payroll...

539
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,517
...to protect the city
from the Red Army...

540
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,986
...which is leaving Moscow
in a couple of minutes.

541
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,091
Trouble is, when the real Red Menace
shows up...

542
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:30,057
...the sheriff will still be
crying wolf. What do you got?

543
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:32,356
- Is that good?
- Sure looks good from here.

544
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,760
Hildy, when did you get back?

545
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,332
- How are you, Eddie?
- Glad to see you.

546
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,299
- Glad to see you.
- Where'd you get the hat?

547
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:41,064
- I paid 12 bucks for that hat.
- Coming back to work?

548
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:44,004
It's a farewell appearance.
I'm going into business for myself.

549
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,111
- What doing?
- I'm getting married tomorrow.

550
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,941
Again? Are we invited to the wedding?

551
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,879
I might use you for a bridesmaid, Roy.

552
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,883
- How are you, Murphy?
- What are you getting married for?

553
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:58,181
- None of your business.
- Ain't fooling us, are you?

554
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,723
Fooling? Look what I've got in here.

555
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:03,361
Three tickets to Albany
on the 6:00 train tonight.

556
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:04,563
Three?

557
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:08,666
For me and my beau and,
hats off boys, his sweet darling ma.

558
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,768
- That's nice.
- What kind of marriage is that?

559
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,167
I'm settling down.
I'm through with the newspaper business.

560
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:17,900
Can you picture Hildy singing
lullabies and hanging out didies?

561
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,237
- Swapping lies over the back fence?
- Sour grapes.

562
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,107
She'll get tired beating rugs.

563
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:24,374
I'm not going to beat any rugs.

564
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:27,913
That's 3rd and Jefferson.
Where the Central School is.

565
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,020
- No school this time of day.
- What do you care for? You quit.

566
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,519
You said you were through.

567
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:35,057
I just thought it might be
a good fire, that's all.

568
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,424
- What's that?
- Practicing for the Williams party.

569
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,758
- You'll miss a nice hanging.
- Not interested.

570
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,958
Tell them to pipe down.

571
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:51,834
Keep quiet down there! How do you
expect us to get any work done?

572
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,035
Shut up!

573
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,911
Very little respect
for the press around here.

574
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,148
Say, did anybody phone me?

575
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:00,376
Not that I know of.

576
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,020
Say, Hildy, does Walter know
you're getting married?

577
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:05,156
- Just had lunch with him.
- Does he know you're quitting?

578
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:08,225
- I told him. Any more questions?
- Shall I deal you in?

579
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:11,225
I haven't got time.
I have to do a yarn on Williams.

580
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,398
Did he know what he was doing
when he fired that gun?

581
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,126
If you ask us, no. If you ask the
state alienist, the answer is yes.

582
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,099
- Who is he? What's he do?
- He was a bookkeeper.

583
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,296
He starts at $20 a week.
After 14 years...

584
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,032
...he works himself up to $17.50.
- Got more gum?

585
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:27,474
McClosky Company goes out of business.
Williams loses his job.

586
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,840
Can't get another.

587
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:30,682
I'm in.

588
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,712
So he hangs around the park listening
to soapbox spellbinders...

589
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,820
...making speeches,
and begins believing them.

590
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:38,183
And makes some of his own.

591
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:40,052
- Up a dime.
- I'm in.

592
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,857
- Anything else, Doc?
- No, that'll be all, Mr. Burns.

593
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,258
Everything okay?

594
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,955
Nothing to worry about.

595
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,395
Good, good.

596
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:50,660
How are you doing, Bruce?

597
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,337
Just one more thing.

598
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:55,939
- Good day, Mr. Burns. Mr. Baldwin.
- Goodbye, Doc. Thanks very much.

599
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:58,235
Who's the beneficiary?

600
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:01,436
- Excuse me?
- That is, in case of your death.

601
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:04,639
- Who do we pay the money to?
- Why, Hildy, of course.

602
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,876
I don't know. That would make me
feel pretty funny.

603
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:11,352
Now, why shouldn't I make
Hildy my whatever-it-was?

604
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,286
I feel I should take care of her.

605
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,983
But you will take care of her, Bruce.

606
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,028
Say, if that doctor is right,
I'm good for a long time yet.

607
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,428
Look, Bruce, this is
a debt of honor with me.

608
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:25,195
I was a bad husband to Hildy.

609
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,304
She could have claimed
a lot of alimony.

610
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:28,803
But she wouldn't take any.

611
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,067
She had it coming to her,
but she was too independent.

612
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:34,303
- I'm independent too, you know.
- I know you are.

613
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,743
But look, you just figure it this way.

614
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:40,646
I'm good for, we'll say
at least 25 years yet.

615
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:44,789
By then, you'll have made enough so
that money won't mean anything to you.

616
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,855
But suppose you haven't made good.

617
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,857
What about Hildy's old age?
Think of Hildy.

618
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,063
I can see her now.

619
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:55,529
White-haired, lavender and old lace.

620
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:58,260
- Can't you see her, Bruce?
- Yes, yes, I can.

621
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,632
She's old, isn't she?

622
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:05,535
Don't you think that Hildy's entitled
to spend her remaining years...

623
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,942
...without worries of money?
Of course you do, Bruce.

624
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:10,911
Of course, if you put it that way.

625
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:14,676
And remember, I love her too.

626
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,945
Yes, I'm beginning to realize that.

627
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,091
And the beauty of it is...

628
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:23,420
...she'll never have to know
until I've passed on.

629
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,621
Maybe she'll think kindly of me...

630
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,763
...after I'm gone.

631
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:42,411
You make me feel like a heel,
coming between you.

632
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,243
No, no, Bruce.
You didn't come between us.

633
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,079
It was all over for her before you came
on the scene. For me...

634
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,245
...it'll never be. What do you want?

635
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,823
Can I see you a minute, please?

636
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,584
Excuse me, Bruce.

637
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:59,396
Did you get it, you get it?

638
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:00,929
Where is it? Come on.

639
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,796
- Certified?
- Sure. But Walter, that's for $2,500.

640
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,835
Here we are certified
and everything.

641
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,975
Certified.

642
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:16,340
I'm afraid Hildy'll feel ashamed
to think she hasn't trusted you.

643
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:17,641
But she'll know some day.

644
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,445
You promised to phone her
as soon as you got the check.

645
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,144
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

646
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:26,449
Get me Hildy Johnson, press room,
criminal courts building.

647
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,787
Sit down, Bruce.
The operator will get her for you.

648
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,893
Excuse me, will you?

649
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,995
Yes, I'll wait, thank you.

650
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,029
Start hollering. Hildegarde.

651
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,764
Thank you.

652
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,499
Hildy Johnson speaking.

653
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,710
Take it easy, will you?

654
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:54,042
Did you get the check?
Is it certified?

655
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:57,222
Certified and everything.
I have it right in my pocket.

656
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,382
In your pocket. That's fine.

657
00:30:59,592 --> 00:31:01,992
Wait. Maybe it isn't so fine.
Where are you?

658
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:03,320
Mr. Burns' office.

659
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:04,655
Is he there?

660
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:09,494
Look, Bruce. I don't want you to
carry that check in your pocket.

661
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,067
Well, because...

662
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,363
Yes, yes, I know all that.
But...

663
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,905
There's an old
newspaper superstition...

664
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:20,169
...that the first big check you get,
you put in the lining of your hat.

665
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,844
In your hat. It brings good luck.

666
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,983
I've been a reporter for 20 years.
I never heard that.

667
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:29,586
Neither did I. I know it
sounds silly, dear, but do it for me.

668
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,016
Yes, yes, right now.

669
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,316
All right. Just a minute.

670
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:43,865
There, I've done it.

671
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,468
Anything else?

672
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,637
Oh, yes.

673
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,898
All right.

674
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,602
Yes, I'll tell him. Goodbye.

675
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,270
Everything all right?

676
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,346
Hildy said she'll get right to work.

677
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,073
- Fine.
- I must be going now.

678
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:02,118
You don't want to forget this.
It might rain, you know.

679
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,321
Thanks.

680
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:06,449
You mind if I don't show you out?
I'm so busy in here.

681
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:07,751
Thanks for everything.

682
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,985
- What did you say?
- Thanks for everything.

683
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:13,062
Nonsense. Don't thank me.
I should thank you.

684
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,755
- So long.
- So long.

685
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,374
Hello, Cooley.

686
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,605
What are you doing here?

687
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,682
I want an interview with Earl Williams.

688
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:35,012
- No more interviews.
- Why not?

689
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,712
Sheriff's orders. Besides, a doctor's
coming over. Can't do it.

690
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,323
Say, is this your money?

691
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:41,891
- I don't think it is.
- Twenty bucks?

692
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,652
- I guess it is.
- That's what I thought.

693
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,193
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

694
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:46,728
Open up here.

695
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:49,093
- Now, Hildy, don't be...
- I won't be long.

696
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:56,104
- Hello, Earl.
- Hello.

697
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,936
My name's Johnson. Mind if I talk to
you for a few minutes?

698
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,374
No, I haven't anything else to do.

699
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,207
I guess that's right.

700
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:10,580
So I couldn't plead insanity.
I'm just as sane as anybody else.

701
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,188
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?

702
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:15,292
Of course not. It's against
everything I stand for.

703
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,258
They know it was an accident.
I'm not guilty.

704
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,329
It's just the world.

705
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:23,396
I see what you mean.

706
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:27,333
Sorry about the lipstick, Earl.
Now, look, after you lost your job...

707
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,301
- ...what did you do?
- I tried to find another job.

708
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,238
I mean, how did you spend your time?

709
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:36,346
I used to sit around in the park,
anyplace. I don't smoke.

710
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,483
When you were in the park,
did you hear any speeches?

711
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,153
You mean those fellows
that talk too much?

712
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,421
I didn't pay any attention...

713
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,614
Did you hear anything they said?

714
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:47,825
Yes.

715
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,527
Is there anything in particular
you remember?

716
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,856
- There was one fellow.
- What did he talk about?

717
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:55,260
He talked about production for use.

718
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,593
Production for use?

719
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:59,862
Yes, he said everything
should be made use of.

720
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:01,369
Makes sense, doesn't it?

721
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:04,235
Yes, I liked him.
He was a good speaker.

722
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:06,868
When you found yourself
with that gun in your hand...

723
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:10,139
...and that policeman coming at you,
what did you think about?

724
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,941
I don't know exactly.

725
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,642
Could it have been
"production for use"?

726
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:18,380
- I don't know. L...
- What's a gun for, Earl?

727
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,716
A gun?

728
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,756
Why, to shoot, of course.

729
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:24,660
And maybe that's why you used it.

730
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,387
- Maybe.
- It seems reasonable.

731
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,589
Yes, yes, it is.

732
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:31,201
I've never had a gun in my hand before.

733
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,428
And that's what a gun's for, isn't it?

734
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,300
- Maybe that's why...
- Sure, it is.

735
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:40,035
That's what I thought of. "Production
for use". It's simple, isn't it?

736
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,736
- Very simple.
- There's nothing crazy about that.

737
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:45,574
- Nothing at all.
- Write about that in your paper.

738
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:48,150
You bet I will.
Who sent you the roses?

739
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,048
Miss Mollie Malloy.
She's wonderful...

740
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,347
Is that her picture?

741
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:54,492
- Yes. She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Time's up, Hildy.

742
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:55,751
All right.

743
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:58,296
Guess that's all.

744
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,697
I liked talking to you.
Goodbye, Miss Johnson.

745
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,364
Goodbye, Earl.

746
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:06,365
Good luck.

747
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,801
- Three landladies, boys.
- Got well, didn't you?

748
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,807
<i>I wonder what the Post
will do without Hildy?</i>

749
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,276
You suppose Walter Burns
will ever let her go?

750
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,780
Remember when Fenton
wanted to go to Hollywood?

751
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:21,077
- Had him thrown in jail for arson.
- Forgery.

752
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,618
- Was that it?
- Yeah, give me some change.

753
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:24,822
Hey, Mac.

754
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:26,656
Hey, Stairway Sam.

755
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,393
Would you mind turning on some lights?

756
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,392
It's so dark, you can't see anything.

757
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,121
Who's this guy Hildy's marrying?

758
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:34,822
I don't know. Bruce something.

759
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,297
- I give the marriage six months.
- Why?

760
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,698
She won't be able to be away
from the paper any longer.

761
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:41,964
Did you see her
when that bell went off?

762
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:46,042
It must be pretty nice to be able
to walk out of a place and quit.

763
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:49,612
I had a publicity job offered to
me last year. I should have taken it.

764
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,749
That's what I'd like,
a job on the side.

765
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,716
A desk and a stenographer.
I wouldn't mind a nice, big blonde.

766
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,013
With big brown eyes.

767
00:35:57,222 --> 00:36:00,089
I'll bet you ten to one it don't last
six months.

768
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:03,693
She's just like us, or we wouldn't be
waiting for that guy to dance.

769
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:07,161
- Miss Mollie Malloy.
- Hello, Mollie. How's tricks?

770
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:11,598
- I've been looking for you tramps.
- Come to pay a call on Williams?

771
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:15,466
Nice roses you sent Earl. What do you
want done with them tomorrow?

772
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,073
A lot of wise guys, ain't you?

773
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:19,267
You're breaking up the game.
What do you want?

774
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:20,740
I came to...

775
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:24,149
I came to tell you what I
think of you. All of you.

776
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,748
Keep your shirt on.

777
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:28,715
If you was worth breaking my nails on,
I'd tear your face open.

778
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:32,186
What are you sore about?
Wasn't that a swell story we gave you?

779
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:36,222
You crumbs have been making
a fool out of me long enough.

780
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:39,864
I never said I loved Earl, and was
willing to marry him on the gallows.

781
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:41,065
You made that up.

782
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,329
And about my being his soul mate and
having a love nest with him.

783
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,437
You've been around that cuckoo
since they threw him in the death house.

784
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,540
- That's a lie.
- Everybody knows you're his girlfriend.

785
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:53,540
I met Mr. Williams
just once in my life.

786
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,270
When he was wandering in the
rain without his hat and coat on...

787
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,574
...like a sick dog,
the day before the shooting.

788
00:36:58,784 --> 00:36:59,784
Give me one.

789
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,944
I went up to him like any
human being would...

790
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:04,019
...and asked him what was the matter.

791
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:07,715
He told me about being fired after
being on the job for 14 years.

792
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,587
- Who bets?
- Bet 20 cents.

793
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:12,127
I brought him up to my room
because it was warm.

794
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,060
Put it on a phonograph.

795
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,166
Listen to me, please.

796
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:20,597
I tell you he just sat there
talking to me all night.

797
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:23,036
He never once laid a hand on me.

798
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,301
And in the morning he went away...

799
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,104
...and I never saw him again
till that day of the trial.

800
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:31,078
- Sure, I was his witness.
- And what a witness.

801
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,944
That's why you're persecuting me.

802
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:36,245
Because Earl treated me decent,
and not like an animal.

803
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,946
- We're busy.
- Go see your boyfriend.

804
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:40,852
- He's got a nice room.
- Not for long.

805
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,050
He left a call for 7 a.m.

806
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:47,662
It's a wonder lightning don't
come down and strike you all dead.

807
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,302
What's that?

808
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:02,742
They're fixing up a pain in the neck
for your boyfriend.

809
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:04,477
Shame on you.

810
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:06,116
Shame on you!

811
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:10,388
A poor little fellow that never
meant nobody no harm.

812
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:13,581
Sitting with the angel of death,
and you cracking jokes.

813
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,487
You're going to get out of here.

814
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,051
- Take your hands off me!
- Let's get out of here.

815
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,389
They ain't human.

816
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:22,226
- I know. They're newspapermen.
- All they've been doing is lying.

817
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,425
All they're doing is writing lies.

818
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,399
Why won't they listen to me?

819
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:29,070
Why won't they listen to me?

820
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:48,817
Who?

821
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,027
Hildy Johnson?

822
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:52,755
Hang on. She'll be back in a minute.

823
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:58,829
You guys want to play any more cards?

824
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,767
What's the use? I can't win anyway.

825
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:20,218
Gentlemen of the press.

826
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:23,820
Hildy.

827
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,459
Phone for you.

828
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,670
What?

829
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,331
Where are you?

830
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,137
You're where?

831
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,437
Well, how did that happen?

832
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,971
Never mind, never mind.
I'll be right down.

833
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,009
I'm sorry, Pete. Sorry.

834
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,717
Hi, Sheriff. How you doing?

835
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:51,650
My shin and my back.
What's going on around here?

836
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:54,587
- Bruce was in trouble.
- Lioness rushes to defend cub.

837
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:57,023
Man forgets hankie.
Mama goes to wipe nose.

838
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,254
I still give that marriage
six months.

839
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:01,523
I don't know what you fellows
are talking about.

840
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,360
What do you want, Pete?

841
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,662
Oh, I got the tickets for
the hanging here, boys.

842
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,100
- Pete?
- What?

843
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:12,037
Why can't you hang this guy at
five o'clock instead of seven?

844
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:15,111
It won't hurt you, and
we can make the city edition.

845
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:16,610
That's kind of raw, Roy...

846
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,340
...hanging a man in his sleep
to please a newspaper.

847
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:22,952
But you can reprieve him twice
so he hangs three days before election.

848
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:25,282
And you can run on a
law-and-order ticket.

849
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,254
I had absolutely nothing
to do with those reprieves.

850
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,485
How do we know there won't
be another tonight?

851
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,720
What if Egelhoffer
finds Williams insane?

852
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,526
He won't find him insane, because
he isn't. He's just as sane as I am.

853
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,134
Saner!

854
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:40,930
Be serious, boys.
After all, this is a hanging.

855
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,039
And it's going to go
according to schedule.

856
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,675
Seven o'clock in the morning
and not a minute earlier.

857
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:48,175
There's such a thing as
being humane, you know.

858
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,314
All right, Pinky.
Wait until you want a favor.

859
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,642
- And please don't call me Pinky.
- Why not?

860
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:55,752
Because I got a name, see,
and it's Peter B. Hartwell.

861
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,422
- What's the "B" for?
- Bull.

862
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,657
But I'm innocent. I didn't do it.
I never stole a watch in my life!

863
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,192
I know you didn't, Bruce.
Mike, let him out.

864
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:07,490
I can't. He's accused of stealing
a watch they found on him.

865
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,462
- But I never stole...
- Please, Bruce.

866
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:11,431
Who accused him?
Diamond Louie, a crook.

867
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,503
- I know. It's no good.
- You going to let him out or not?

868
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:16,071
- I never stole...
- Please.

869
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,902
<i>All right, you're not.
Read the Post in the morning.</i>

870
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,578
I can't imagine who'd do a thing
like that to me.

871
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,715
- I can't think of any enemies.
- I'm sure you haven't any...

872
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:27,885
- Have you got the check?
- Oh, yes, I have it right here.

873
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,087
That's a funny superstition
you newspaper people have.

874
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,950
Yes, isn't it?

875
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,750
About being arrested, I thought...

876
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,986
...maybe Walter Burns might have
something to do with it.

877
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,391
But then, of course,
I realized he couldn't have.

878
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,931
- Why?
- He's a very nice fellow.

879
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,034
Oh, yes, I found that out.

880
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:47,967
- What's the matter?
- I've lost my wallet.

881
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,869
Yes? Well, Bruce, never mind.
I have the money.

882
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:52,600
Better give me the check too.

883
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:54,506
And that picture of us in Bermuda.

884
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:57,876
Don't bother, Bruce.
You'll find lots of things missing.

885
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:03,147
Wait here.
I'm not taking any more chances.

886
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,755
I'll be down in three minutes.
We'll take the next train.

887
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:06,957
Sorry.

888
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,490
"And so into this
little tortured mind...

889
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,789
...came the idea that that gun
had been produced for use.

890
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,489
And use it he did.

891
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,034
But the state has a production
for use plan too. It has a gallows.

892
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:23,435
And at 7 a.m., unless a miracle occurs,
that gallows will be used...

893
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:26,577
...to separate the soul
of Earl Williams from his body.

894
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:28,507
And out of Mollie Malloy's life...

895
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,739
...will go the one kindly
soul she ever knew".

896
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:34,815
That's as far as she got.

897
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,851
But can that girl write an interview?

898
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,579
She'll do till somebody
else comes along.

899
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,156
It's not ethical,
reading other people's stuff.

900
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,849
Where you get that ethics stuff?

901
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,995
You're the only one
who'll swipe any of it.

902
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:49,030
I say anybody that can write like that
won't give it up to sew socks...

903
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,202
...for a guy in the
insurance business.

904
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,803
Now I give that marriage 3 months
and I'm laying 3-1.

905
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,973
- Any takers?
- I'll take that bet.

906
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:59,610
A girl can't leave the room without
being discussed by old ladies.

907
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,575
<i>Hello, Post? Get me Walter Burns,
will you, please?</i>

908
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:04,610
Don't get sore.
We were only saying...

909
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:07,046
...a reporter like you
wouldn't quit so easy.

910
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:10,983
This is Hildy Johnson. I can quit
all right, without a single quiver.

911
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,783
I'll live like a human being,
not like you chumps.

912
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:16,392
Is that you?
I've got some news for you.

913
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:19,723
I got the interview, but I've got
some more important news.

914
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,990
Better get a pencil
and take it down.

915
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,633
All ready?

916
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:26,303
Now, get this,
you double-crossing chimpanzee.

917
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:28,734
There won't be an interview
or a story.

918
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,874
Your check leaves with me
in 20 minutes.

919
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:33,544
I wouldn't cover
the burning of Rome for you.

920
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:35,770
And if I ever lay my eyes
on you again...

921
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:39,280
...I'll hammer on your monkey skull
so it rings like a Chinese gong!

922
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:43,011
You don't know why I'm angry?
Get Louie to tell you about his watch.

923
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:45,416
And there's just one other
little thing.

924
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:51,352
Hear that?
That's the story I just wrote.

925
00:43:51,563 --> 00:43:53,963
I know we had a bargain.
I said I'd write it.

926
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:57,396
I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up.
It's all in little pieces now.

927
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:59,729
And I hope to do the same
for you someday.

928
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:02,099
That's my farewell
to the newspaper game.

929
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,138
I'll be a woman.
Not a news machine.

930
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:08,142
I'll have babies, give them cod-liver
oil and watch their teeth grow.

931
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:11,338
And if I ever see one of them
look at a paper, I'll brain him.

932
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:12,743
Where's my hat?

933
00:44:14,386 --> 00:44:17,287
- Mr. Burns? Yes, she's still here.
- Give me that.

934
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:20,688
And another thing I want...

935
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,860
Where is my...
There it is.

936
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:27,756
- Hello, Doctor. Sorry to be late.
- Quite all right.

937
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:30,230
These boys from the newspapers
take up my time.

938
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:32,596
They wanted me to hang Williams
at their convenience.

939
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:34,904
- Oh, hello, Earl.
- These newspapers.

940
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:37,074
- What they did to me in Chicago!
- I believe it.

941
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:38,970
- Always after me for interviews.
- Me too.

942
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,407
I did promise to make
some sort of statement...

943
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:43,513
...when I finished here.
You don't mind, do you?

944
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:46,582
It is hardly ethical. All statements
are supposed to come from me.

945
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:50,482
I see. What do you say to giving
them some sort of joint interview?

946
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:53,556
I can discuss some of the psychological
aspects of the case and you...

947
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,453
We'd have our pictures
taken together?

948
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,252
- Shaking hands.
- Splendid idea!

949
00:44:57,462 --> 00:44:58,622
I don't take a good picture.

950
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,162
That doesn't matter.
Publicity's the thing.

951
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,857
Doctor, I'm getting awful tired.

952
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:05,934
Can't I go back to jail again?

953
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:07,764
I'm sorry.
I forgot you were there.

954
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:09,701
No, we've further questions for you.

955
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:11,933
Sheriff, would you extinguish
the lights?

956
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:16,273
That will help with what we're
doing here. Now, let me see.

957
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:21,307
Mr. Williams, you know, of course,
that you are going to be executed.

958
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,181
Who do you feel
is responsible for that?

959
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:27,119
I am innocent. It wasn't my fault.

960
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:29,020
- Well, Murph.
- Send a post card, kid.

961
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,819
- Goodbye.
- Au revoir, Hildegarde.

962
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:32,087
When will we see you again?

963
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:34,424
Next time you see me,
I'll be in a Rolls Royce...

964
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:36,429
...giving interviews on success.

965
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:38,067
So long, you wage slaves.

966
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:41,465
When you're climbing fire escapes,
getting kicked out front doors...

967
00:45:41,673 --> 00:45:43,470
...and eating in one-armed joints...

968
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:45,870
...don't forget your pal,
Hildy Johnson.

969
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:49,342
And when the road beyond unfolds,
and the work...

970
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:57,451
Look out! It's a jailbreak!

971
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,393
What's the matter? What happened?

972
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,397
Watch where you're aiming,
will you?

973
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,327
Watch the gate! He'll try the gate!

974
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:09,659
Who got away? Who was it?

975
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,301
- Earl Williams!
- Who did he say?

976
00:46:11,503 --> 00:46:12,868
Earl Williams!

977
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:16,535
Hello, hello! Hurry up,
this is important.

978
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:19,133
- Flash! Earl Williams just escaped.
- Jailbreak!

979
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:20,905
Williams went over the wall!

980
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,409
I don't know anything yet.

981
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:31,421
<i>Hello, Post? Give me Walter Burns,
quick. Hildy Johnson.</i>

982
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,089
Walter? Walter? Hildy.

983
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,692
Earl Williams just escaped
from the county jail.

984
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,395
Don't worry, I'm on the job.

985
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:55,974
Hey, Cooley!

986
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:57,181
Wait!

987
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:02,981
Hey, wait a minute!

988
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,107
Cooley, I want to talk to you!

989
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:35,683
This is Endicott. Give me rewrite.

990
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:37,714
He ain't here.

991
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:39,981
Hello, Gil?
Here's the situation now.

992
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,625
Ready? Williams was taken to
the sheriff's...

993
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:46,593
...to be examined by Egelhoffer.
In a few minutes, he shot his way out.

994
00:47:46,798 --> 00:47:50,791
Nobody knows where he got the gun.
He got out through the skylight.

995
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:52,697
He must have slid down the rainpipe.

996
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:55,134
Nobody knows where he got it.
Or they won't talk.

997
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,340
Give me the desk.

998
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:58,908
The crime commission offers
a $10,000 reward.

999
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,510
No clue yet as to
Williams' whereabouts.

1000
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:04,273
Here's a little feature.
An accident about a tear bomb.

1001
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,882
Yeah, tear bomb, tear bomb.
Criminals cry for it.

1002
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,109
I don't know.

1003
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,948
The tear bomb went off unexpectedly
in the hands of the bombing squad.

1004
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:13,783
The following deputies
were rushed to the hospital.

1005
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:15,983
- A fine friend you are.
- Their names are...

1006
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:18,094
...Mervin D. Wilkerson,
the mayor's brother-in-law.

1007
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:19,524
After all I've done for you.

1008
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,995
Howard Schuster, the sheriff's uncle.

1009
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,430
Highlights on Sheriff
Hartwell's manhunt.

1010
00:48:24,636 --> 00:48:27,298
William Mansfield, his landlord,
and Lester Winthrop...

1011
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:28,767
...who married the sheriff's niece.

1012
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:31,100
You remember, the very homely dame?
Call you back.

1013
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:34,437
Mrs. William Rice, scrub lady,
while scrubbing the eigth floor...

1014
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:36,614
...was shot by one of
the sheriff's deputies.

1015
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:37,814
Look, I'm not...

1016
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:40,083
There goes another scrub lady!

1017
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:42,617
It was only a flesh wound.
They took her to the hospital.

1018
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,789
- McCue speaking. Give me the desk.
- Any dope on how he escaped?

1019
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,981
Maybe the sheriff let him out
so he could vote for him.

1020
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:51,684
A man answering the description
of Earl Williams boarded a southbound...

1021
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:53,523
Call you back.

1022
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:56,393
- I thought you'd gone.
- I thought so too.

1023
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,569
Get me Walter Burns, quick!

1024
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:03,365
Walter, listen.

1025
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:07,010
I've got the story on how Williams
escaped, and I've got it exclusive.

1026
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:09,543
That's right, and it's a pip.

1027
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:12,238
It cost me $450
to tear it out of Cooley.

1028
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,678
What's the story?

1029
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:17,013
I'll give it to you. But first I have
to tell you I gave him money.

1030
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:18,654
And it wasn't exactly mine.

1031
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:20,790
It's Bruce's money
and I want it back.

1032
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,056
Bruce's money?

1033
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:25,695
Sure, you'll get it.
Now, what's the story?

1034
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:28,764
I'll send the money.
I swear it on my mother's grave.

1035
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:31,959
All right. Here's the...
Wait a minute, your mother's alive!

1036
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,661
My grandmother's grave.
What's the story?

1037
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:36,737
You get that money down here.

1038
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:40,240
All right, here's your story.
The jailbreak of your dreams.

1039
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:43,209
This expert, Dr. Egelhoffer,
the thinker from New York...

1040
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:46,008
...was giving Williams a sanity
test in the sheriff's office.

1041
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:49,448
Sticking a lot of pins in him
so he could get his reflexes.

1042
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:52,589
He decided to reenact the crime
as it had taken place...

1043
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,384
...in order to study
Williams' coordination.

1044
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:58,892
I'm coming to it. He had to have a gun
to reenact the crime with.

1045
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:03,193
Who do you suppose supplied it?
Peter B. Hartwell. "B" for brains.

1046
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:06,966
No kidding!

1047
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:10,130
I'm not kidding. I'm not
good enough to make this up.

1048
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,899
The sheriff gave his gun
to the professor...

1049
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:15,102
...who gave it to Earl, who shot
the professor in the classified ads.

1050
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:16,837
No, ads.

1051
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:18,709
Ain't it perfect?

1052
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:21,441
If he'd unrolled a red carpet
and loaned Williams an umbrella...

1053
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:22,949
...it couldn't have been more ideal.

1054
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:25,622
Who? Oh, no.
Egelhoffer wasn't badly hurt.

1055
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:28,519
They took him to the hospital,
where they're afraid he'll recover.

1056
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:30,557
That's great work, Hildy.

1057
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:33,492
Stop worrying about that money.
You'll get it in 15 minutes.

1058
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:37,691
I had better. Bruce is waiting
in a taxi for me and we're in a hurry.

1059
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:38,960
Hold on a minute.

1060
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,603
Vangie, come here.

1061
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:43,137
There's a guy in a taxi
in front of criminal courts.

1062
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:44,341
Name's Bruce Baldwin.

1063
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:48,104
- What does he look like?
- He looks like Ralph Bellamy.

1064
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:49,802
- Oh, him?
- Can you handle it?

1065
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:51,948
I've never flopped
on you yet, have I?

1066
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:55,051
Come on, get going. You only got
about two minutes. Hurry.

1067
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:57,721
Sorry to keep you waiting.
How much was it again?

1068
00:50:57,922 --> 00:51:00,686
$450. Well, just a second.

1069
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:04,350
Louie, come here. I need $450
worth of counterfeit money.

1070
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,861
- Can't carry that much, boss.
- No, just the $450 counterfeit.

1071
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:09,066
I got that on me.

1072
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,293
Quite a coincidence.
Take it over to Hildy.

1073
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,470
It's coming.
I'm sending it with Louie.

1074
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:16,265
Thanks for your story.
And good luck on your honeymoon.

1075
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:19,807
No, no, never mind the thanks.
Just see that money gets here.

1076
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,613
- Hildy, you still here?
- No, I'm in Niagara Falls.

1077
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:27,079
McCue speaking.

1078
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:29,651
Emil, I got a good feature
on the manhunt.

1079
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:33,950
Ready? Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe, colored,
gave birth to a pickaninny...

1080
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:37,889
...in a patrol wagon with Hartwell's
rifle squad acting as nurses.

1081
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:39,961
Phoebe was walking along
the street when...

1082
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:41,597
That's right.

1083
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:44,700
So they coaxed her
into the patrol wagon.

1084
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:47,166
When the pickanninny was born,
they checked...

1085
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:50,465
...to see if it was Earl Williams.
They knew he was hiding somewhere.

1086
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:54,545
Here's the payoff. They named the kid
Peter Hartwell DeWolfe.

1087
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,610
Press room.

1088
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,339
Bruce? I thought you were
downstairs in a...

1089
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,812
What?

1090
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:03,248
Arrested again. What for this time?

1091
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:07,720
Well, they called it "mashing".

1092
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:10,724
No, I didn't, Hildy!

1093
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:13,322
I was sitting in the taxi
where you left me...

1094
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:18,332
...and the young lady seemed to have a
dizzy spell and I just...

1095
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:23,064
She's kind of...

1096
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,506
Yes, she's a blonde.

1097
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:29,077
Yes, very blonde.

1098
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,578
Never mind. I know how it happened.
Just a minute.

1099
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:34,774
Get me Walter Burns. Hildy Johnson.

1100
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:38,620
Bruce, where are you? Twenty-seventh
Precinct? Hold on a minute.

1101
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,586
Walter, you...

1102
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,452
He was there a minute ago.

1103
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,991
But I want...

1104
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:47,130
"I'm sorry, I can't locate him".
Why, that double-crossing...

1105
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:50,698
Hello, not you.
Bruce, I can't get there right away.

1106
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:52,096
How about 20 minutes?

1107
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:54,134
I have to wait here for the...

1108
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,101
I'll tell you when I see you.

1109
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:58,070
If I ever get my hands
on Walter...

1110
00:52:58,276 --> 00:53:00,836
- Anything I can do to help?
- How much money you got?

1111
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:02,376
- $1.80.
- 64 cents.

1112
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,344
- Welcome to it.
- Thanks, you better buy an annuity.

1113
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:08,984
What's that, Emil? No, I can't
give you an official statement.

1114
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:12,452
No, wait a minute. Here's the mayor.
How about a statement, Mayor?

1115
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:15,888
- Don't pester me now, please.
- His Honor won't say anything.

1116
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:17,958
- Have you seen Hartwell?
- Hard to tell.

1117
00:53:18,162 --> 00:53:19,993
There's so many
cockroaches around...

1118
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:22,063
Wait a minute.
How about a statement?

1119
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:25,963
- We go to press in 20 minutes.
- I've nothing to say. Not now.

1120
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,400
Just a moment. What do you know
about the escape?

1121
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:30,733
- Where'd he get the gun?
- Not so fast.

1122
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:33,410
- About the election...
- What effect will this have?

1123
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:35,010
None whatsoever.

1124
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:37,613
How can an unavoidable
misfortune like this...

1125
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:41,376
...have any influence on the upright
citizens of our fair city?

1126
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:44,521
Mr. Mayor, please, is there
a Red Menace or ain't there?

1127
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,383
How did Williams get out?

1128
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:49,059
Have you picked out somebody
to be responsible?

1129
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,820
Any truth in the report
you're on Stalin's payroll?

1130
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:54,520
The senator claims you
sleep in red underwear.

1131
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:57,428
Never mind the jokes.
Don't forget I'm the mayor and...

1132
00:53:57,635 --> 00:53:59,193
Hartwell, I want to see you!

1133
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,427
How'd he get away?

1134
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:02,003
Where'd he get the gun?

1135
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:04,640
Any statement on the
Red Uprising tomorrow?

1136
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:07,106
- Red Uprising?
- There will be no Red Uprising.

1137
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:10,178
The governor says the situation
calls for the militia.

1138
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:13,873
I say anything the governor says
is a tissue of lies.

1139
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:16,781
Here's a red-hot
statement from the governor.

1140
00:54:16,988 --> 00:54:19,422
He claims the mayor and
sheriff have shown themselves...

1141
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:22,616
...to be a couple of eight-year-olds
playing with fire.

1142
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:25,659
You can quote him as follows:

1143
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:28,798
"It's lucky for the city that
next Tuesday is Election Day...

1144
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,730
...as the citizens will thus be saved
the expense of impeaching...

1145
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:34,769
...the mayor and the sheriff".
That's all. Call you back.

1146
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,701
Nice to have seen you, Mayor.

1147
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:40,308
- Excuse me, I've got so much to do.
- Wait. Who engineered this getaway?

1148
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:41,978
- Was it the Reds?
- Was it you?

1149
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,739
Me? Just a minute.
I'll tell you. I've got him located.

1150
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:45,949
- Williams?
- Where?

1151
00:54:46,017 --> 00:54:47,951
Out on Center Street.
I just got a tip.

1152
00:54:48,152 --> 00:54:50,382
- Why didn't you say so?
- The rifle squad is going out.

1153
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:52,351
You'll catch him if you hurry.

1154
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:54,285
- Look, please...
- Pete, I want to talk to you.

1155
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:55,659
I've got so much to do.

1156
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,091
- See here, Fred...
- Pete, you're through.

1157
00:54:58,296 --> 00:54:59,593
Through? You mean I'm through?

1158
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,856
I'm scratching your name
off the ticket...

1159
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:03,761
...and running
Sherman in your place.

1160
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:07,267
"Reform the Red with a rope"!
Williams isn't a Red and you know it!

1161
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,905
But there's Communistic
sympathizers and I thought...

1162
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:12,166
...if I got a slogan
like that I could...

1163
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:14,606
That's got nothing to
do with this case.

1164
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:18,578
There are 200,000 votes at stake.
If he don't hang, we'll lose them.

1165
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,414
We're going to hang him.
He can't get away.

1166
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:24,019
What do you mean?
He did get away, didn't he?

1167
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:25,950
What do you want?

1168
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:28,182
- What do you want?
- Are you Sheriff Hartwell?

1169
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:30,019
I'm him. What is it?

1170
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:33,856
You're a hard man to find.
I have a message from the governor.

1171
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:36,329
- What?
- It was a reprieve for Earl Williams.

1172
00:55:36,534 --> 00:55:38,024
- For who?
- Earl Williams.

1173
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:40,601
You said there wasn't going
to be a reprieve.

1174
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:44,263
It frightens me to think of what
I'd like to do to you. Who was there?

1175
00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:46,636
- Nobody. He was fishing.
- Get the governor on the phone.

1176
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,641
He's not there.
He's duck shooting.

1177
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,508
Blasted nimrod!
Fishing, duck shooting...

1178
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:54,310
A guy who's done nothing
for the last 40 years...

1179
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,543
...gets elected governor
and he's a Tarzan.

1180
00:55:56,754 --> 00:56:00,155
Read that. "Insane". He knows
very well Williams isn't insane.

1181
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:02,019
I never met the man.

1182
00:56:02,226 --> 00:56:04,524
- Pure politics.
- It's an attempt to ruin us.

1183
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:06,196
What do we tell the reporters?

1184
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:09,127
Tell them the party is through
on account of you.

1185
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:12,234
As an afterthought, tell them
I want your resignation now.

1186
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:14,563
Hello. Yes, yes, this is Hartwell.

1187
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:16,103
What? Where?

1188
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,766
Holy Moses! Hold the wire!

1189
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,204
They've got Williams!

1190
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:22,276
The rifle squad has him
at his house.

1191
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,846
- Tell them to hold the phone.
- Hold the wire.

1192
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:28,041
- Cover up that transmitter.
- No. Now, listen.

1193
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:29,583
You never arrived with this.

1194
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:31,652
Yes, I did. I came through
that door...

1195
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:34,290
- How much do you make?
- I thought he was sheriff...

1196
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:36,221
- What's your salary?
- $40 a week.

1197
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:39,590
How'd you like to make $350 a month?
That's almost $100 a week.

1198
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:41,662
I couldn't afford that. Who? Me?

1199
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:44,835
They need a fellow like you
in the city sealer's office.

1200
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:46,195
- The what?
- City sealer's.

1201
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:48,304
You mean I should work
in the sealer's...

1202
00:56:48,506 --> 00:56:52,909
My wife wouldn't like that. She lives
in the country with my family.

1203
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:56,944
That's all right. Bring her in.
We'll pay all the expenses.

1204
00:56:57,148 --> 00:56:59,082
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

1205
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:02,684
I got two kids in school. If they
change towns, they'll lose a grade...

1206
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:04,377
No. They'll skip a grade.

1207
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,852
And I guarantee you
that they'll graduate...

1208
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:08,957
Hold your horses, Olsen.
Hurry up, Fred.

1209
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,286
Now, what do you say?

1210
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:12,223
That puts me in a peculiar hole.

1211
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,591
No, it doesn't.
You never delivered this.

1212
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,994
You got caught in traffic
or something.

1213
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:18,828
- No, I came...
- Pretend you didn't.

1214
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:21,504
Now get out and don't let
anybody see you.

1215
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:24,105
- But how do I know...
- Come to my office tomorrow.

1216
00:57:24,308 --> 00:57:25,798
- What's your name?
- Pettibone.

1217
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,307
- Pettibone?
- Not really.

1218
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:29,411
Lay low and keep your mouth shut.

1219
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,604
- I'm tired anyhow.
- Go to this address.

1220
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:32,976
Nice homey place.

1221
00:57:33,184 --> 00:57:35,482
They'll take care of you.
Tell them Fred sent you.

1222
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:38,746
- Here's $50 on account.
- Wait, I'll tell you in one minute.

1223
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,424
You forgot to tell me
what a city sealer does.

1224
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,286
- Is it hard?
- Easy. Very easy.

1225
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:45,519
Good, because my health isn't
what my wife...

1226
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:47,287
- We'll fix that too.
- My wife?

1227
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:49,557
Yes, fix anything. Go ahead.

1228
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,166
They're still on the phone.

1229
00:57:51,368 --> 00:57:55,134
- Tell them to shoot to kill.
- But the reprieve!

1230
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:57,705
- Go ahead and do as I tell you.
- Hello, Olsen.

1231
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:00,433
Shoot to kill. That's the orders.
Pass the word along.

1232
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,135
- $500 reward.
- $500 for the man who does it.

1233
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:04,678
I'll be right over.

1234
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:08,343
Hi, Hildy.

1235
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:10,577
You double-crossing hyena.

1236
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:12,915
What'd you pull on
Mr. Baldwin this time?

1237
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:15,023
- Who, me?
- You and that albino of yours.

1238
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:17,854
- Evangeline's no albino.
- She'll do, till one comes along.

1239
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:19,689
She was born in this country.

1240
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:23,628
If she tries anything else,
she'll have to stay in this country.

1241
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,270
- Did you bring that money?
- Oh, yeah, $400.

1242
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:28,870
$450.

1243
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:32,366
All right, you can't blame
a guy for trying.

1244
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:34,203
- Give me a receipt.
- I'll give you a scar.

1245
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:35,639
You got plenty of them.

1246
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,541
I'll take Mr. Baldwin's wallet too.

1247
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:40,308
- Mr. Baldwin's what?
- His purse. Come on, Louie.

1248
00:58:40,518 --> 00:58:43,851
All right, Hildy. I'll do it for you
because I like you.

1249
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:47,080
But tell your financier to be
more careful, know what I mean?

1250
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,623
I'll loan him a pair of
your brass knuckles.

1251
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:51,727
Don't talk that way.
I'll take that.

1252
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,897
- I'll take it to the station.
- Wait a minute!

1253
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:57,363
Take it to the 27th Precinct
and tell the cops how this happened.

1254
00:58:57,568 --> 00:58:59,798
I couldn't do that.
Burns would turn me in.

1255
00:59:00,004 --> 00:59:01,733
- Not a bad idea.
- Here, catch!

1256
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:03,065
Louie!

1257
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:14,845
Hello, operator. Hildy Johnson.
Will you get me...

1258
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:16,713
Drop that phone!

1259
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:18,183
Never mind.

1260
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:20,954
You won't tell anybody where I am.

1261
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:27,325
Put that gun down, Earl.

1262
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:31,761
You don't want to shoot me.
I'm your friend, remember?

1263
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:34,699
I'm writing the story on you
of production for use.

1264
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:38,500
- That's right. Production for use.
- You don't want to hurt your...

1265
00:59:38,709 --> 00:59:41,177
Don't move!
Maybe you're my friend, maybe not.

1266
00:59:41,612 --> 00:59:42,874
But don't come nearer.

1267
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,742
You can't trust anybody
in this crazy world.

1268
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:49,078
I don't blame you.
I wouldn't trust anybody either.

1269
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,982
Don't do that.
Put it back. Put it back.

1270
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:56,091
If you try any tricks, I'll shoot you.
I can do it right from here.

1271
00:59:56,797 --> 00:59:58,264
You don't want to kill anybody.

1272
00:59:58,732 --> 01:00:01,667
No, you're right.
I don't want to kill anybody.

1273
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:05,134
- That's what I thought.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

1274
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,466
I was going to close the door
so nobody'd see you.

1275
01:00:07,675 --> 01:00:09,609
No, you weren't.
You were going to get somebody.

1276
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,176
But I don't want that.
All I want is to be left alone.

1277
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:13,812
- I won't get anybody.
- You will.

1278
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:17,313
You'll get them after me again.
I won't let you do that. I won't...

1279
01:00:20,154 --> 01:00:22,452
- Give me that.
- I guess I fired all the shells.

1280
01:00:23,157 --> 01:00:26,524
- I'm awful tired.
- That shot. They'll know you're here.

1281
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:27,921
I don't care.

1282
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:31,894
I'm not afraid to die. I told the
guy that when he handed me the gun.

1283
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:34,329
- Quiet!
- Waking me in the middle of the night.

1284
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:36,298
Talking about things
they don't understand.

1285
01:00:36,503 --> 01:00:37,731
Shut up.

1286
01:00:37,938 --> 01:00:40,065
I wish they'd take me back
and hang me.

1287
01:00:40,274 --> 01:00:41,969
They will if you don't keep quiet.

1288
01:00:42,176 --> 01:00:44,007
I couldn't go through
another day like this.

1289
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:45,371
You think I could?

1290
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,443
Get me Walter Burns, quick.
Tell him I need him.

1291
01:00:52,753 --> 01:00:56,086
Bruce, I know I said I'd be down,
but something terrific has happened.

1292
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:57,689
Walter, come right away.

1293
01:00:57,891 --> 01:00:59,256
Wait, Bruce, I'll explain.

1294
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,690
I've got Earl Williams here,
in the press room.

1295
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:03,453
On the level.
Hurry, I need you!

1296
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:06,690
Bruce, I've captured Earl Williams.
You know, the murderer.

1297
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,368
Stay there, Earl. Wait.
Bruce, I'll be down.

1298
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:11,504
As soon as I hand him
to the paper.

1299
01:01:11,705 --> 01:01:14,196
Bruce, I can't.
Don't you realize...

1300
01:01:15,576 --> 01:01:18,943
- Who is it?
- Me, Mollie Malloy. Open the door!

1301
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,280
- What do you want, Mollie?
- I got to find...

1302
01:01:22,483 --> 01:01:24,212
- Where is everybody?
- They've gone.

1303
01:01:24,418 --> 01:01:25,976
Please tell me where.

1304
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:27,881
I don't know,
and I'm awfully busy.

1305
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:30,784
They got him surrounded.
They'll shoot him down like a dog.

1306
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:32,458
They're looking for you too.

1307
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:35,150
I don't care. Tell me.
I ain't afraid of them.

1308
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:38,126
All right, they're down at
Center Street and Fourth.

1309
01:01:38,332 --> 01:01:41,426
- Oh, that's where I used to...
- Mollie, Mollie, don't go.

1310
01:01:41,635 --> 01:01:44,035
Come in, Mollie. Draw up a chair.

1311
01:01:46,473 --> 01:01:48,373
- Hello.
- How did you get in here?

1312
01:01:48,575 --> 01:01:53,069
Down the pipe. I didn't mean to
shoot him. Really, I didn't.

1313
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,339
- Be quiet.
- You believe me, don't you?

1314
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:56,675
Sure, I believe you.

1315
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:59,478
Thanks for the roses.
They were beautiful.

1316
01:01:59,686 --> 01:02:02,519
That's all right, Mr. Williams.

1317
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:06,218
- Don't cry.
- Don't you get hysterical.

1318
01:02:06,427 --> 01:02:07,826
I want to get him out.

1319
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:10,861
- You wouldn't get down that hall.
- But they'll find him.

1320
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:14,056
I know. I'm trying to think
before those reporters come back.

1321
01:02:14,268 --> 01:02:16,065
Let them take me.
What's the difference?

1322
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,862
I'll never let them.

1323
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:20,229
Who locked the door?

1324
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:23,943
- Now it's too late.
- It isn't. Get in this desk.

1325
01:02:24,144 --> 01:02:26,271
- Oh, what's the use?
- Come on, get in.

1326
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,879
We'll get you out in ten minutes.

1327
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:35,847
Pull yourself together.
All right, here. Sit down.

1328
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:39,722
All right, all right,
I'm coming!

1329
01:02:41,395 --> 01:02:44,853
- Don't kick the building down.
- We got phone calls to make.

1330
01:02:45,065 --> 01:02:46,760
What's she doing up here?

1331
01:02:46,967 --> 01:02:48,264
What's the matter?

1332
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:50,403
Came up here and had hysterics.

1333
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:52,538
- How do you feel, kid?
- Not so good.

1334
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:53,967
Get you some water?

1335
01:02:54,174 --> 01:02:56,608
- Do anything for you?
- You don't look so sick.

1336
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,937
- Did you bump into Williams?
- Funny!

1337
01:02:59,146 --> 01:03:00,875
- Where is he?
- Let me alone.

1338
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:03,549
- Okay. Give me the desk.
- No harm in asking.

1339
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:07,345
Hello, Jim. Yes, false alarm.
They surrounded the house, all right...

1340
01:03:07,554 --> 01:03:09,181
...but Williams wasn't there.

1341
01:03:09,389 --> 01:03:11,949
The Halloween outside has the
police standing on its ear.

1342
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:14,650
- I thought you were gone.
- I'm waiting for money from Walter.

1343
01:03:14,862 --> 01:03:16,727
What a chase! Give me Emil.

1344
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:19,023
- Give me the desk.
- Any news, boys?

1345
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:21,463
Yeah, I never been
so tired in my life.

1346
01:03:21,668 --> 01:03:23,067
What? Where?
Melrose Station?

1347
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:25,500
All right, connect me.
Hello, Mollie. How are you?

1348
01:03:25,706 --> 01:03:27,674
Hold it a minute.
This looks good.

1349
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:30,969
An old lady claims Williams
is hiding under her piazza.

1350
01:03:31,178 --> 01:03:32,702
Tell her to stand up.

1351
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,605
- You want to go out on it?
- I'll cover this end.

1352
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:39,081
- I spent $1.40 on taxicabs already.
- No more going out.

1353
01:03:39,286 --> 01:03:41,618
- Never mind, Sarge.
- Who pulled the shades down?

1354
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:43,653
They were throwing
those lights around.

1355
01:03:50,397 --> 01:03:52,490
You know, I've got
a hunch Williams...

1356
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:54,690
...ain't anywhere they've been
looking for him.

1357
01:03:54,902 --> 01:03:56,631
He might be here in this building.

1358
01:03:56,837 --> 01:04:00,068
Sure, sure, hanging around
like a duck in a shooting gallery.

1359
01:04:00,274 --> 01:04:02,708
From the skylight, but
how did he reach the ground?

1360
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:06,903
- I'm pretending there ain't any Earl.
- He could have jumped to this roof.

1361
01:04:07,114 --> 01:04:09,480
From the roof he could slide
down the drainpipe.

1362
01:04:09,683 --> 01:04:11,446
And come in any of these windows.

1363
01:04:11,652 --> 01:04:13,313
If the story walks in the window...

1364
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:17,115
Masterminds. Why don't you go home?
Maybe Williams will call on you.

1365
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:19,359
It'd be funny if he was
in this building.

1366
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,255
Why not search the building?

1367
01:04:21,461 --> 01:04:24,760
- I am not wandering all over.
- A great bunch of reporters you are.

1368
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:27,126
Too lazy to go after
the biggest story in years.

1369
01:04:27,334 --> 01:04:29,825
You seem pretty anxious
to get rid of us.

1370
01:04:30,037 --> 01:04:32,631
- Are you trying to scoop us?
- Are you crazy? On my time?

1371
01:04:32,839 --> 01:04:36,866
Maybe Mollie's been giving her
the truth on how Williams got the gun.

1372
01:04:37,077 --> 01:04:38,101
I didn't do nothing.

1373
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:40,337
- Come clean.
- Let the girl alone. She's...

1374
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:41,775
Well?

1375
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:43,472
Mrs. Baldwin. Mother.

1376
01:04:43,684 --> 01:04:47,518
Don't "mother" me. Playing cat and
mouse and keeping my boy locked up.

1377
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:50,554
Making us miss two trains, and you
supposed to be married tomorrow.

1378
01:04:50,757 --> 01:04:54,249
- I'll be with you in five minutes...
- Just give me Bruce's money.

1379
01:04:54,461 --> 01:04:57,919
You can stay here forever,
you and that murderer you caught.

1380
01:04:58,131 --> 01:05:00,326
- Murderer?
- Which one of these men is it?

1381
01:05:00,534 --> 01:05:03,298
- They all look like murderers.
- What murderer did you catch?

1382
01:05:03,503 --> 01:05:05,403
I never said any such thing.

1383
01:05:05,606 --> 01:05:08,166
I'm quoting my son.
He has never lied to me.

1384
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:09,375
Somebody's lying.

1385
01:05:09,576 --> 01:05:11,976
- I never said anything like that.
- Yes, you did.

1386
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:14,613
I said I was trying
to find the murderer.

1387
01:05:14,815 --> 01:05:16,806
- Quit stalling.
- She's got it balled up.

1388
01:05:17,017 --> 01:05:18,609
Who are you holding out on?

1389
01:05:18,819 --> 01:05:20,650
Nobody. Now let me go, will you?

1390
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,612
Stop it, stop it!

1391
01:05:22,823 --> 01:05:26,816
She don't know where he is.
I'm the only one that knows.

1392
01:05:27,027 --> 01:05:28,517
- Where's Williams?
- Try and find out.

1393
01:05:28,729 --> 01:05:31,323
- Come on, talk.
- Now you want me to talk?

1394
01:05:31,531 --> 01:05:33,158
- Talk.
- Ain't that funny?

1395
01:05:33,367 --> 01:05:36,768
You wouldn't listen to me before,
and now you want me to talk.

1396
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:37,970
Don't say anything.

1397
01:05:38,138 --> 01:05:39,901
- I know what I'm doing.
- Stay out of this.

1398
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:42,405
- Why didn't you listen to me?
- Cut that out.

1399
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:44,133
- Hands off!
- Where is he?

1400
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:47,836
Why do you want to know? So you can
write more lies to sell papers?

1401
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:51,848
- Never mind that.
- All right. I'll give you a story.

1402
01:05:52,052 --> 01:05:53,110
A wonderful story!

1403
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:57,051
Only this time it'll be true.
You'll never find me now!

1404
01:05:57,457 --> 01:05:59,220
Get the ambulance, somebody!

1405
01:05:59,426 --> 01:06:01,155
Get an ambulance, somebody!

1406
01:06:04,831 --> 01:06:08,062
- She's dead.
- No, she isn't killed, she's moving!

1407
01:06:12,472 --> 01:06:15,498
- Did you see that? She jumped.
- I know that.

1408
01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:17,108
Where have you got Williams?

1409
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,335
Hidden. He's in the desk.

1410
01:06:19,546 --> 01:06:20,843
She didn't kill herself.

1411
01:06:21,048 --> 01:06:22,538
- How're you doing?
- Let me out.

1412
01:06:22,749 --> 01:06:24,376
Quiet. You're sitting pretty.

1413
01:06:24,584 --> 01:06:26,313
- What's in there?
- Who are you?

1414
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,613
- This is Bruce's mother.
- What are you doing?

1415
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:30,881
- Shut up!
- You're doing something wrong.

1416
01:06:31,091 --> 01:06:33,082
- Mother, please.
- Take her out of here.

1417
01:06:33,293 --> 01:06:37,229
- Take the lady to Polack Mike's.
- My name's Louie Peluso.

1418
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:41,160
See that she doesn't talk to anyone.

1419
01:06:41,368 --> 01:06:42,995
Tell them it's a case of D.T.'s.

1420
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:45,171
Don't worry, Mother.
It's only temporary.

1421
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:47,435
Let go of me.

1422
01:06:48,075 --> 01:06:50,805
- Where are you going?
- To get Bruce out of jail.

1423
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:54,640
- Why did you do this to me?
- Get Bruce out of jail?

1424
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:58,181
How can you worry about a man
who's resting in a police station?

1425
01:06:58,385 --> 01:07:01,411
- This is war! You can't desert me.
- Get off that trapeze.

1426
01:07:01,621 --> 01:07:03,020
You've got your story.

1427
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:05,987
<i>"Earl Williams captured
by the Morning Post".</i>

1428
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:08,718
I covered your story for you,
now I'm getting out.

1429
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:13,525
You drooling idiot, there are 365 days
in a year one can get married.

1430
01:07:13,734 --> 01:07:16,669
How many times you got a murderer
locked up in a desk?

1431
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:19,236
You got the whole city
by the seat of the pants.

1432
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:21,498
You've got the brain of a pancake.

1433
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:24,233
This isn't just a story.
It's a revolution.

1434
01:07:24,444 --> 01:07:27,311
The greatest yarn since
Livingston discovered Stanley.

1435
01:07:27,514 --> 01:07:31,177
- The other way around.
- Don't get technical at such a time.

1436
01:07:31,384 --> 01:07:34,285
You've taken a city that's been
graft-ridden for 40 years...

1437
01:07:34,488 --> 01:07:37,582
...and given us a chance to have
the same kind of government...

1438
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,349
...New York has under La Guardia.

1439
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:43,620
If I didn't have your best interest
at heart, I wouldn't argue with you.

1440
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:47,596
You've done something big.
You've stepped up into a new class.

1441
01:07:47,801 --> 01:07:51,669
We'll make such monkeys of those
ward healers nobody'll vote for them.

1442
01:07:51,872 --> 01:07:53,737
- Expose them?
- We'll crucify that mob.

1443
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:56,932
We'll keep Williams under cover,
until we can break the story...

1444
01:07:57,144 --> 01:07:59,044
...then share the glory
with the governor.

1445
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:01,840
- I get it, I get it.
- You'll kick over City Hall.

1446
01:08:02,048 --> 01:08:05,984
You got the mayor and Hartwell
backed up against the wall.

1447
01:08:06,186 --> 01:08:09,019
This isn't just a newspaper story.
It's a career!

1448
01:08:09,222 --> 01:08:12,419
And you bellyache about catching
the eight or nine o'clock train.

1449
01:08:12,626 --> 01:08:16,323
- But I never figured it that way.
- Because you're a doll-faced hick.

1450
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:20,022
They'll be naming streets after you.
There'll be statues of you.

1451
01:08:20,233 --> 01:08:23,396
The movies will be after you.
There'll be a Hildy Johnson cigar.

1452
01:08:23,603 --> 01:08:26,902
I can see the billboards now:
"Light up with Hildy Johnson..."

1453
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:28,904
- We got a lot to do.
- Now you're talking.

1454
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:33,170
- We can't leave Williams here.
- We'll take him to my private office.

1455
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,440
- How are you going to take him?
- We'll carry the desk over.

1456
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:38,242
It's crawling with cops outside.

1457
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:40,646
We'll lower it out
the window with pulleys.

1458
01:08:40,854 --> 01:08:42,583
Start pounding out a lead!

1459
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:46,748
- How much of this stuff do you want?
- All you the words you got.

1460
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,293
- Can I call the mayor a bird of prey?
- Call him anything you like.

1461
01:08:50,497 --> 01:08:54,558
Give him the works. Hello, Duffy?
We got the biggest story in years.

1462
01:08:54,768 --> 01:08:58,135
<i>"Earl Williams captured by
the Morning Post. Exclusive!"</i>

1463
01:08:58,338 --> 01:09:00,067
Tear out the whole front page.

1464
01:09:00,273 --> 01:09:03,367
The whole front page. Out!
And never mind the European war.

1465
01:09:03,577 --> 01:09:07,206
We got something bigger than that.
Hildy Johnson's writing the lead.

1466
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:09,314
And get hold of Butch O'Connor.

1467
01:09:09,516 --> 01:09:11,746
Tell him to come up here
with his wrestlers.

1468
01:09:11,952 --> 01:09:13,044
Yeah, Butch O'Connor.

1469
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:15,187
What? I've got a desk
I want moved...

1470
01:09:15,388 --> 01:09:16,753
What the deuce do you want?

1471
01:09:16,957 --> 01:09:18,117
- Hello, Bruce.
- Hildy.

1472
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:20,623
Never mind the Chinese earthquake.

1473
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:23,318
- I just want to ask you...
- How'd you get out of jail?

1474
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:25,259
Not through any help of yours.

1475
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:26,659
I'm not talking to you.

1476
01:09:26,867 --> 01:09:31,065
I had to wire Albany for $100
so I could get out on bail.

1477
01:09:31,638 --> 01:09:34,971
What will they think in Albany?
The money went to the police station.

1478
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:38,542
- We're waiting for that story.
- We'll explain everything to them.

1479
01:09:38,745 --> 01:09:40,508
- Where's mother?
- She left.

1480
01:09:40,714 --> 01:09:41,714
I can't hear you.

1481
01:09:41,882 --> 01:09:43,372
- Where'd she go?
- Out someplace.

1482
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:46,780
- Junk the Polish Corridor!
- Tell me where my mother was going.

1483
01:09:46,987 --> 01:09:49,114
- She couldn't say.
- This is more important.

1484
01:09:49,322 --> 01:09:51,654
- Did she get the money?
- She left in a hurry.

1485
01:09:51,858 --> 01:09:53,519
- I'll take that money.
- In my purse.

1486
01:09:53,727 --> 01:09:56,855
I can handle things.
I'll take that certified check too.

1487
01:09:57,063 --> 01:10:00,499
I'll give you the tickets.
You'll find your money in the wallet.

1488
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,964
My wallet? This is my wallet.

1489
01:10:03,169 --> 01:10:06,070
Say, there's something funny going on...
What are you doing?

1490
01:10:06,273 --> 01:10:08,173
Just wanted to look at it.

1491
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:10,070
Hildy, I'm taking...

1492
01:10:10,777 --> 01:10:13,507
- I'm taking the 9 o'clock train.
- Sure, sure.

1493
01:10:13,713 --> 01:10:17,046
Did you hear what I said?
I said I am taking the 9 o'clock...

1494
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,081
Oh, Bruce, I put it in here!

1495
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:23,021
Let her alone, will you, buddy.

1496
01:10:23,223 --> 01:10:25,748
- Do me a favor...
- Just answer one question.

1497
01:10:25,959 --> 01:10:27,927
You don't want to come
with me, do you?

1498
01:10:28,128 --> 01:10:29,527
Answer me.
You don't, do you?

1499
01:10:29,729 --> 01:10:32,323
No. Take the Miss America
pictures off page six.

1500
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:34,432
Hildy, tell me.
Tell me the truth.

1501
01:10:34,634 --> 01:10:37,569
Wait a minute.
Now look here, my good man...

1502
01:10:37,771 --> 01:10:39,432
You shut up, Burns.

1503
01:10:39,639 --> 01:10:41,163
You're doing all this to her.

1504
01:10:41,374 --> 01:10:43,365
She wanted to get away from you.

1505
01:10:43,576 --> 01:10:45,601
But you caught her
and changed her mind...

1506
01:10:45,812 --> 01:10:48,372
Stick Hitler on the funny page.
Now let me ask you...

1507
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:51,106
Will you give up everything
for a man like him?

1508
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:53,786
No, but something's happened.
I'll tell you...

1509
01:10:53,987 --> 01:10:56,012
Tell him nothing.
He's a spy, you fool.

1510
01:10:56,222 --> 01:10:57,553
- I am not a spy.
- Ridiculous.

1511
01:10:57,757 --> 01:10:59,384
You're coming with me right now.

1512
01:10:59,592 --> 01:11:02,254
Just a second. This is the
biggest thing in my life.

1513
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:05,329
I see. I'll keep.
I'm like something in the icebox.

1514
01:11:05,532 --> 01:11:07,090
You just don't love me.

1515
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:10,997
That isn't true. Just because you
won't listen you say I don't love you.

1516
01:11:11,204 --> 01:11:14,173
You never intended to be decent
and live like a human being.

1517
01:11:14,374 --> 01:11:17,138
All right, if that's what
you want to think.

1518
01:11:17,344 --> 01:11:18,971
I'm trying to concentrate.

1519
01:11:19,179 --> 01:11:22,410
- You're just like him and all the rest.
- Sure. That's what I am.

1520
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:25,812
What? Leave the rooster story alone.
That's human interest.

1521
01:11:26,353 --> 01:11:28,412
If you had any sympathy
or understanding...

1522
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:30,589
- I understand, all right...
- Wait a minute.

1523
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:34,817
There's one question I want to know.
The mayor's first wife's name.

1524
01:11:35,028 --> 01:11:37,588
The one with the wart on her? Fanny.
What, Duffy?

1525
01:11:37,797 --> 01:11:39,389
You never loved me at all.

1526
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:41,794
Never mind.
You don't work for advertising.

1527
01:11:42,002 --> 01:11:44,800
If you change your mind,
I'm on the 9 o'clock train.

1528
01:11:45,005 --> 01:11:47,974
If you want me, take me as I am.
Don't try to change me.

1529
01:11:48,174 --> 01:11:50,734
I'm no suburban bridge player.
I'm a newspaperman.

1530
01:11:50,944 --> 01:11:53,208
That's it. Keep it coming
as fast as you can.

1531
01:11:53,413 --> 01:11:55,677
Get back in there, you mock turtle.

1532
01:11:58,184 --> 01:12:00,675
You tell Butch it's a matter
of life and death?

1533
01:12:00,887 --> 01:12:04,186
Good. Butch's on his way. We just
have to hold out for 15 minutes.

1534
01:12:04,391 --> 01:12:07,451
- The boys will be back to phone.
- I'll handle them.

1535
01:12:08,962 --> 01:12:11,453
God, now the moon's out.

1536
01:12:15,635 --> 01:12:18,433
Fine. Three taps is me.
Don't forget. Got enough air?

1537
01:12:18,638 --> 01:12:21,664
- Not very much.
- That better? You're sitting pretty.

1538
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:24,472
- How's it coming?
- All right. Where's Bruce?

1539
01:12:24,677 --> 01:12:26,577
- He went out.
- Is he coming back here?

1540
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:29,613
Certainly. Didn't you hear him?
What have you got so far?

1541
01:12:29,816 --> 01:12:33,650
"While Hartwell's paid gunmen stalked
the city, shooting bystanders...

1542
01:12:33,853 --> 01:12:35,821
...spreading terror,
Williams was lurking..."

1543
01:12:36,022 --> 01:12:38,684
<i>Wait a minute.
Aren't you going to mention the Post?</i>

1544
01:12:38,892 --> 01:12:41,588
- I did. Second paragraph.
- Who reads the second paragraph?

1545
01:12:41,795 --> 01:12:44,229
How long have I been
telling you how to write a story?

1546
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:45,431
I'm sorry.

1547
01:12:49,202 --> 01:12:51,363
What's the idea of locking this door?

1548
01:12:51,571 --> 01:12:53,596
- Who's that?
- Bensinger. That's his desk.

1549
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:56,332
Open the door, will you?

1550
01:12:56,543 --> 01:12:58,636
<i>- What's his name?
- Bensinger, of the Tribune.</i>

1551
01:12:58,845 --> 01:13:00,472
<i>- The Tribune?
- Who's in there?</i>

1552
01:13:02,482 --> 01:13:04,040
Haven't you any better sense...?

1553
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:08,186
Hello. Hello, Mr. Burns. Quite
an honor having you come over here.

1554
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:12,324
- Hello, Bensinger.
- You know my... I just want to get my...

1555
01:13:12,525 --> 01:13:15,551
It's quite a coincidence
seeing you tonight, isn't it?

1556
01:13:15,762 --> 01:13:16,762
How do you mean?

1557
01:13:16,863 --> 01:13:19,730
I was talking to our Mr. Duffy
about you this afternoon.

1558
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:21,901
Really? Nothing detrimental, I hope.

1559
01:13:22,102 --> 01:13:24,070
On the contrary. On the contrary.

1560
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:27,068
That was one swell story
you had in the paper this morning.

1561
01:13:27,273 --> 01:13:29,332
Did you care for the
poem, Mr. Burns?

1562
01:13:29,542 --> 01:13:31,533
The poem? The poem was great.

1563
01:13:31,744 --> 01:13:33,143
I liked the ending especially.

1564
01:13:33,346 --> 01:13:35,041
"And all is well outside his cell...

1565
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:37,478
...but in his heart he hears
the hangman calling...

1566
01:13:37,684 --> 01:13:38,684
...the gallows falling...

1567
01:13:38,885 --> 01:13:41,683
...and his white-haired
mother's tears".

1568
01:13:41,888 --> 01:13:43,287
- Heartbreaking?
- That's fine.

1569
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:44,980
Would you like to work for me?

1570
01:13:45,191 --> 01:13:46,556
We can use a man like you.

1571
01:13:46,759 --> 01:13:48,954
All we got are lowbrows
like Johnson here.

1572
01:13:49,162 --> 01:13:51,995
- Are you serious, Mr. Burns?
- Serious? Wait a minute.

1573
01:13:52,198 --> 01:13:54,689
Duffy, I'm sending
Mr. Bunsinger over to see you.

1574
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:56,266
- Bensinger.
- Mervyn, isn't it?

1575
01:13:56,469 --> 01:13:59,097
- Yeah... No. Roy. Roy V.
- Certainly.

1576
01:13:59,305 --> 01:14:01,273
Roy V. Bensinger, the poet.

1577
01:14:01,474 --> 01:14:05,376
You wouldn't know. You probably never
heard of Shakespeare either.

1578
01:14:06,913 --> 01:14:10,280
<i>Put Mr. Bensinger on staff.
How much you getting on the Tribune?</i>

1579
01:14:10,483 --> 01:14:12,451
- $75.
- I'll give you $100 and a byline.

1580
01:14:12,652 --> 01:14:15,780
Now you give him everything he wants,
you understand?

1581
01:14:15,989 --> 01:14:19,789
Roy, write me a story from the
point of view of the escaped man.

1582
01:14:19,993 --> 01:14:22,325
He hides, afraid of every sound,
every light.

1583
01:14:22,529 --> 01:14:25,020
He hears footsteps, they're closing in.

1584
01:14:25,231 --> 01:14:28,962
- Get the sense of the animal at bay.
- Sort of Jack London style?

1585
01:14:29,169 --> 01:14:32,263
- I'll get my rhyming dictionary.
- It doesn't have to rhyme.

1586
01:14:32,472 --> 01:14:34,633
I'm deeply grateful, Mr. Burns.

1587
01:14:36,276 --> 01:14:38,676
If there's an opening
for a war correspondent...

1588
01:14:38,878 --> 01:14:40,311
<i>...I parler a little French.</i>

1589
01:14:40,513 --> 01:14:42,981
<i>- I'll keep you in mind.
- Au revoir, mon capitain.</i>

1590
01:14:43,183 --> 01:14:44,275
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1591
01:14:48,054 --> 01:14:50,784
"His white-haired mother's tears".
That's the tops.

1592
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:53,652
Listen, that fellow Bensinger
is on his way right now.

1593
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,294
Handle him with kid gloves.
Have him write poetry.

1594
01:14:56,496 --> 01:14:58,862
We don't want him.
Stall him until the extra's out.

1595
01:14:59,065 --> 01:15:01,158
Say his poetry smells
and kick him downstairs.

1596
01:15:01,367 --> 01:15:03,232
- Double-crosser.
- That'll teach him.

1597
01:15:03,436 --> 01:15:05,563
He won't quit his paper
without giving notice after this.

1598
01:15:05,772 --> 01:15:06,830
- I mean you.
- Me?

1599
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,474
You'd double-cross anybody...
Wait a minute.

1600
01:15:09,676 --> 01:15:12,645
Bruce isn't coming back.
He said he was taking the 9:00 train.

1601
01:15:12,845 --> 01:15:14,335
In that case, he's gone by now.

1602
01:15:14,547 --> 01:15:17,675
Don't sit there like a frozen robin.
Get on with the story.

1603
01:15:17,884 --> 01:15:19,977
We ought to be finished
when Butch gets here.

1604
01:15:20,186 --> 01:15:23,781
How you have messed up my life.
What am I going to do?

1605
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:26,254
Window's too small.
We'll carry the desk out.

1606
01:15:26,459 --> 01:15:29,690
I'd be on that train right now.
I'm a sap, falling for your line.

1607
01:15:29,896 --> 01:15:33,229
- They'll name streets after me...
- Yes, well, get back to work.

1608
01:15:33,433 --> 01:15:35,924
I'm not going back to work.
Walter, what...?

1609
01:15:37,136 --> 01:15:39,127
- Who is it?
- It's me, boss. It's Louie.

1610
01:15:39,339 --> 01:15:40,363
Louie.

1611
01:15:42,175 --> 01:15:44,109
- What's the matter?
- Where's Mrs. Baldwin?

1612
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:45,436
What happened?

1613
01:15:45,645 --> 01:15:49,479
Down Western Avenue, we was going
65 miles an hour, know what I mean?

1614
01:15:49,682 --> 01:15:51,206
Where's the old lady?

1615
01:15:51,417 --> 01:15:54,045
We run smack into a police patrol.
Busted it in half.

1616
01:15:54,254 --> 01:15:55,448
Was she hurt?

1617
01:15:55,655 --> 01:15:58,681
Can you imagine bumping
into a load of cops?

1618
01:15:58,891 --> 01:16:01,792
- What did you do with her?
- Search me, when I come to...

1619
01:16:01,995 --> 01:16:04,122
You were with her.
You were in the cab.

1620
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:06,992
- The driver got knocked cold.
- Butterfingers!

1621
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,431
- You handed her over to the cops.
- What do you mean?

1622
01:16:10,637 --> 01:16:12,332
They was on the wrong
side of the street.

1623
01:16:12,538 --> 01:16:15,029
Fine. Now she's probably
squawking to the police.

1624
01:16:15,241 --> 01:16:17,300
She's not squawking much.
Know what I mean?

1625
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:19,239
Don't tell me...
Was she killed?

1626
01:16:19,445 --> 01:16:20,776
Was she? Did you notice?

1627
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:23,881
Me with a gun on the hip and
a kidnapped lady on my hands...

1628
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:26,142
...I'm going to ask questions
from cops?

1629
01:16:26,352 --> 01:16:29,810
- You know what I mean?
- Dead, dead. This is the end!

1630
01:16:30,456 --> 01:16:31,456
It's fate.

1631
01:16:31,524 --> 01:16:32,821
What will be will be.

1632
01:16:33,026 --> 01:16:34,823
What am I going to say to Bruce?

1633
01:16:35,028 --> 01:16:36,052
What can I tell him?

1634
01:16:36,262 --> 01:16:38,560
If he loves you, you won't
have to tell him anything.

1635
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:42,098
Would you rather have had the old
dame drag the police in here?

1636
01:16:42,302 --> 01:16:44,497
I killed her. I'm responsible.

1637
01:16:44,704 --> 01:16:46,865
What am I going to do?
How can I ever face Bruce again?

1638
01:16:47,073 --> 01:16:49,803
- Look at me, Hildy.
- I am looking at you, you murderer.

1639
01:16:50,009 --> 01:16:52,273
If it was my own grandmother,
I'd carry on.

1640
01:16:52,478 --> 01:16:55,447
- You know I would, for the paper.
- Louie, where'd it happen?

1641
01:16:55,882 --> 01:16:57,281
Western and 34th.

1642
01:16:57,483 --> 01:17:00,714
- I got to get out of here...
- We can do more here. Be calm.

1643
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,114
Listen...

1644
01:17:03,856 --> 01:17:06,586
- Hello, hello.
- Maine 4557.

1645
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:08,988
Who? Butch, where are you?

1646
01:17:09,195 --> 01:17:10,856
Mission Hospital?
Receiving room.

1647
01:17:11,064 --> 01:17:12,691
What are you doing there?

1648
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:14,764
Was an old lady brought in
from a smashup?

1649
01:17:14,967 --> 01:17:17,993
For H. Sebastian, Butch,
it's a matter of life and death.

1650
01:17:18,204 --> 01:17:20,138
- Nobody?
- I can't hear.

1651
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:23,969
- Morningside 2469.
- You got who? Speak up. A what?

1652
01:17:24,177 --> 01:17:26,441
You can't stop for a dame now!

1653
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:30,049
I don't care if you've been after her.
Our lives are at stake!

1654
01:17:30,249 --> 01:17:32,410
Are you going to let a woman
come between us?

1655
01:17:32,618 --> 01:17:35,246
Was there an old lady brought in
in an auto smashup?

1656
01:17:35,455 --> 01:17:38,083
Butch, I'd put my arm in fire
for you up to here.

1657
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:39,690
You can't double-cross me.

1658
01:17:39,892 --> 01:17:41,086
Look around, please.

1659
01:17:41,294 --> 01:17:43,387
All right, put her on.
I'll talk to her.

1660
01:17:43,596 --> 01:17:47,088
Good evening, madam. Now, listen,
you ten-cent glamour girl...

1661
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,768
...you can't keep Butch
from his duty. What's that?

1662
01:17:49,969 --> 01:17:52,631
You say that again,
I'll kick you in the teeth!

1663
01:17:52,839 --> 01:17:54,670
Say, what kind of language is that?

1664
01:17:54,874 --> 01:17:57,035
Now, look here, you...

1665
01:17:57,243 --> 01:17:59,438
She hung up. What did I say?

1666
01:18:00,646 --> 01:18:03,513
Duffy, how do you like that?
Mousing around with some big...

1667
01:18:03,716 --> 01:18:07,208
- Will you shut up? I'm trying to hear!
- Duffy! That's cooperation.

1668
01:18:08,554 --> 01:18:10,317
Well, where is Duffy?

1669
01:18:11,491 --> 01:18:14,688
Diabetes. I ought to know better than
to hire anybody with a disease.

1670
01:18:14,894 --> 01:18:17,158
Give me Olympia 2136, will you?

1671
01:18:17,363 --> 01:18:19,126
- Yes, boss.
- Louie, it's up to you.

1672
01:18:19,332 --> 01:18:21,926
- Anything you say, boss.
- Get a hold of some guys.

1673
01:18:22,135 --> 01:18:25,502
Anybody with hair on his chest,
get them off the street.

1674
01:18:25,705 --> 01:18:27,036
We got to get that desk out.

1675
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,731
Is it important?
You're the best friend I got.

1676
01:18:29,942 --> 01:18:31,671
- I like you too.
- Then don't fail me.

1677
01:18:31,878 --> 01:18:33,903
Get enough people to move that desk.

1678
01:18:34,113 --> 01:18:35,774
You know me.
Shirt off my back.

1679
01:18:35,982 --> 01:18:37,950
Okay, don't bump into anything.

1680
01:18:38,284 --> 01:18:42,015
- Dumb immigrant is sure to flop on me.
- Try the hospital again.

1681
01:18:42,221 --> 01:18:44,416
If he's not back in five,
we'll carry it alone.

1682
01:18:44,624 --> 01:18:46,717
- Do anything you want.
- There's a million ways.

1683
01:18:46,926 --> 01:18:49,690
- We can have firemen take it out.
- I don't care what you do.

1684
01:18:49,896 --> 01:18:53,332
- Come here. See if we can lift it.
- What? Nobody? Never mind.

1685
01:18:53,533 --> 01:18:55,057
- Are you going to help me?
- No!

1686
01:18:55,268 --> 01:18:57,600
- I'll strain my back.
- I'll find Mrs. Baldwin.

1687
01:18:57,804 --> 01:18:59,829
- Don't open that door!
- I'll go to the morgue...

1688
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:03,668
- We want to talk to you a minute.
- Let go. What's the idea?

1689
01:19:03,876 --> 01:19:05,002
Get your hands off me!

1690
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:07,179
- Now look here, Johnson...
- Hey, you!

1691
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:08,380
You mean me?

1692
01:19:08,514 --> 01:19:12,473
Yes, you. What do you mean by
breaking in here like this?

1693
01:19:12,685 --> 01:19:15,245
Don't bluff me. I don't care
what paper you're editor of.

1694
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:18,856
Let go of me. Something's
happened to my mother-in-law.

1695
01:19:19,058 --> 01:19:23,688
- We know what you are up to.
- She and Mollie were in here talking.

1696
01:19:23,896 --> 01:19:26,091
I don't know anything.
And there's been an accident.

1697
01:19:26,299 --> 01:19:28,790
There's something
very peculiar going on here.

1698
01:19:29,001 --> 01:19:30,992
- Now see here...
- Just a moment, Hartwell.

1699
01:19:31,204 --> 01:19:34,037
Make your accusations
in the proper manner.

1700
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,299
Otherwise, I'll have to
ask you to get out.

1701
01:19:36,509 --> 01:19:37,509
Ask me to what?

1702
01:19:37,877 --> 01:19:39,367
Get out.

1703
01:19:39,579 --> 01:19:43,447
You will, eh? Don't let anybody
in or out. We'll see about this.

1704
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:46,482
- Give him the third degree.
- Make them talk and you got Williams.

1705
01:19:46,686 --> 01:19:50,019
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
Are you going to talk?

1706
01:19:50,223 --> 01:19:53,021
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you know about Williams?

1707
01:19:53,226 --> 01:19:55,160
There. Now we're getting some...

1708
01:19:55,361 --> 01:19:57,522
Take her away.
I got ways to make her talk.

1709
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:59,288
Don't you dare touch me or...

1710
01:20:00,099 --> 01:20:01,430
- She got a gun!
- Grab it!

1711
01:20:01,634 --> 01:20:03,158
No, you don't. Walter!

1712
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:05,837
All right, Burns.
I'll take that gun.

1713
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,601
- Where did you get this?
- I can carry a gun.

1714
01:20:09,809 --> 01:20:11,572
- Not this gun.
- I can explain it.

1715
01:20:11,777 --> 01:20:15,770
She was interviewing Williams,
so I gave her a gun to defend herself.

1716
01:20:15,982 --> 01:20:19,918
Interesting. But this is the gun
that Williams shot his way out with.

1717
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:22,519
My good man, are you trying
to make me out a liar?

1718
01:20:22,722 --> 01:20:25,054
I ought to know my own gun,
oughtn't I...?

1719
01:20:25,258 --> 01:20:27,522
- So that's where Williams got it.
- She got it from him.

1720
01:20:27,727 --> 01:20:28,727
Where's Williams?

1721
01:20:28,794 --> 01:20:30,955
- Where is he?
- You're barking up the wrong tree.

1722
01:20:31,163 --> 01:20:32,790
Tell me where he is.

1723
01:20:32,999 --> 01:20:35,365
At the hospital calling on
Professor Egelhoffer...

1724
01:20:35,568 --> 01:20:36,694
...with marshmallows.

1725
01:20:36,903 --> 01:20:39,895
- Where is he?
- Ask the mastermind why he's here.

1726
01:20:40,106 --> 01:20:41,573
What do you know about this?

1727
01:20:41,774 --> 01:20:43,401
My dear fellow...

1728
01:20:43,609 --> 01:20:46,510
<i>...the Morning Post doesn't obstruct
justice or hide criminals.</i>

1729
01:20:46,712 --> 01:20:49,112
- You ought to know that.
- You're under arrest.

1730
01:20:49,315 --> 01:20:51,010
- You too.
- Who's under arrest?

1731
01:20:51,217 --> 01:20:53,549
Listen, you square-toed,
pimple-headed spy...

1732
01:20:53,753 --> 01:20:55,812
...do you realize what you're doing?

1733
01:20:56,022 --> 01:20:57,114
I'll show you.

1734
01:20:57,323 --> 01:20:59,382
<i>You and the Post
are obstructing justice.</i>

1735
01:20:59,592 --> 01:21:01,560
I'll see that you're fined $10,000.

1736
01:21:01,761 --> 01:21:02,853
You'll see nothing.

1737
01:21:03,062 --> 01:21:05,223
<i>I'll begin by impounding
the Post's property.</i>

1738
01:21:05,431 --> 01:21:06,431
Is this your desk?

1739
01:21:06,632 --> 01:21:09,726
What are you afraid of, Hildy?
I dare you to move this desk.

1740
01:21:09,936 --> 01:21:11,631
- Go ahead, try it.
- I will.

1741
01:21:11,837 --> 01:21:15,170
I warn you, you move this desk
out of here, I'll put you behind bars.

1742
01:21:15,374 --> 01:21:17,934
- He can do it too.
- I'll see Roosevelt hears about it.

1743
01:21:18,144 --> 01:21:19,543
Tell him. Come on, boys!

1744
01:21:19,745 --> 01:21:21,736
- Confiscate this desk.
- This is your last chance.

1745
01:21:21,948 --> 01:21:23,779
This is a federal offense.

1746
01:21:23,983 --> 01:21:25,416
We'll take a chance.

1747
01:21:25,618 --> 01:21:26,710
All right.

1748
01:21:27,687 --> 01:21:29,245
Open up this door!

1749
01:21:30,623 --> 01:21:34,184
- Mother! I'm glad to see you...
- That's the man that did it. There.

1750
01:21:37,563 --> 01:21:40,555
- What's the idea here?
- She claims she's been kidnapped.

1751
01:21:40,766 --> 01:21:43,758
They dragged me down all the way
down the stairs and...

1752
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:45,096
Did he do it?

1753
01:21:45,304 --> 01:21:48,000
He was in charge.
He told them to kidnap me.

1754
01:21:48,207 --> 01:21:50,801
Excuse me, madam.
Are you referring to me?

1755
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:52,068
You know you did.

1756
01:21:52,278 --> 01:21:54,212
What about this? Kidnapping, huh?

1757
01:21:54,413 --> 01:21:57,644
Trying to frame me, huh?
I never saw her before in my life.

1758
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:59,442
What a thing to say!

1759
01:21:59,652 --> 01:22:01,847
I was here when that girl
jumped out the window.

1760
01:22:02,054 --> 01:22:03,316
Get the mayor over here.

1761
01:22:03,522 --> 01:22:06,150
Look, madam, be honest.
If you were out joyriding...

1762
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:09,487
...plastered, or got into a scrape,
why don't you admit it instead of...

1763
01:22:09,695 --> 01:22:11,026
...accusing innocent people?

1764
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:13,892
You ruffian! How dare you talk
like that to me!

1765
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,226
He's just crazy, Mother.

1766
01:22:15,434 --> 01:22:18,369
I'll tell more.
I could tell you why they did it.

1767
01:22:18,571 --> 01:22:21,165
They were hiding some
kind of murderer in here...

1768
01:22:21,374 --> 01:22:22,773
Hiding him? In here?

1769
01:22:22,975 --> 01:22:25,671
Madam, you're a cockeyed liar...

1770
01:22:25,878 --> 01:22:27,675
...and you know it!

1771
01:22:28,814 --> 01:22:30,008
- What's that?
- He's in there!

1772
01:22:30,216 --> 01:22:31,911
- Give me the desk.
- What a break!

1773
01:22:32,118 --> 01:22:33,676
- Stand back.
- He might shoot.

1774
01:22:33,886 --> 01:22:34,978
- Guns out.
- He's harmless.

1775
01:22:35,187 --> 01:22:36,449
Don't take any chances.

1776
01:22:36,656 --> 01:22:38,521
He can't hurt anybody,
you've got his gun.

1777
01:22:38,724 --> 01:22:40,783
Go on, you gray-haired old weasel.

1778
01:22:40,993 --> 01:22:42,358
Let me out of here!

1779
01:22:42,762 --> 01:22:45,492
Mother! I was looking
all over for you. What happened?

1780
01:22:45,698 --> 01:22:46,698
Jake, hang on.

1781
01:22:46,899 --> 01:22:47,899
Hildy, call Duffy.

1782
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,727
- No!
- You want to see us scooped?

1783
01:22:50,102 --> 01:22:52,627
- Aim right for the center.
- That's murder.

1784
01:22:52,838 --> 01:22:54,863
Okay, one of you get
on each end of the desk.

1785
01:22:55,074 --> 01:22:56,371
- It's coming up.
- You're covered.

1786
01:22:56,575 --> 01:22:57,769
- In a minute.
- Don't move.

1787
01:22:57,977 --> 01:22:59,137
- Any time now.
- I'll count three.

1788
01:22:59,345 --> 01:23:00,345
It's hot.

1789
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:01,479
Ready?

1790
01:23:01,514 --> 01:23:02,514
Any second now.

1791
01:23:02,648 --> 01:23:04,616
Three. I got you, Williams.

1792
01:23:04,817 --> 01:23:06,785
- Go ahead, shoot me.
- Come out.

1793
01:23:06,986 --> 01:23:10,149
Earl Williams was just captured
in the criminal courts building.

1794
01:23:10,356 --> 01:23:13,154
- On your feet.
- Don't try any funny stuff.

1795
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:14,724
Williams was unconscious.

1796
01:23:14,927 --> 01:23:16,519
The police overpowered him.

1797
01:23:16,729 --> 01:23:19,892
- He offered no resistance.
- His gun wouldn't work.

1798
01:23:20,433 --> 01:23:22,765
<i>The Post turned Williams
over to the sheriff.</i>

1799
01:23:22,968 --> 01:23:24,731
- Put the cuffs on them.
- More later.

1800
01:23:24,937 --> 01:23:28,202
An anonymous note led to
Williams' capture. Hold on.

1801
01:23:29,108 --> 01:23:31,702
The sheriff's tracing a call
that gave away Williams' hiding place.

1802
01:23:31,911 --> 01:23:33,936
- Where's the old lady?
- She went out.

1803
01:23:34,146 --> 01:23:35,374
Call you back.

1804
01:23:45,191 --> 01:23:48,490
- Give me the warden's office.
- You'll wish you'd never been born.

1805
01:23:48,694 --> 01:23:50,093
Will I?

1806
01:23:50,296 --> 01:23:52,662
- Hello, Fred.
- Well, fine work, Pete.

1807
01:23:52,865 --> 01:23:55,299
- You delivered the goods.
- Looks natural, don't it?

1808
01:23:55,501 --> 01:23:57,492
- Sight for sore eyes.
- Aiding a criminal.

1809
01:23:57,703 --> 01:24:00,228
And a little charge of kidnapping...
What's that?

1810
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:01,667
But that's the jail.

1811
01:24:01,874 --> 01:24:05,139
Looks like about ten years apiece
for you two birds.

1812
01:24:05,344 --> 01:24:08,177
<i>When you think you've licked the Post,
it's time to get out.</i>

1813
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:11,042
Whistling in the dark won't help.
You're through.

1814
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:14,811
Archie Leach said that to me
a week before he cut his throat.

1815
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:16,020
Is that so?

1816
01:24:16,155 --> 01:24:19,215
We've been in worse jams than this,
haven't we, Hildy?

1817
01:24:19,425 --> 01:24:22,019
<i>You forget the power
that watches over the Post.</i>

1818
01:24:22,228 --> 01:24:24,662
- It's not with you now.
- Says you.

1819
01:24:24,864 --> 01:24:26,855
I've caught him. Yes, Williams.

1820
01:24:27,066 --> 01:24:29,534
Single-handed.
Proceed to the hanging, per schedule.

1821
01:24:29,735 --> 01:24:31,635
You'll be in office exactly
two days more.

1822
01:24:31,837 --> 01:24:33,805
We'll pull your nose
out of that feedbag.

1823
01:24:34,006 --> 01:24:38,443
I tell you what you'll be doing.
Making brooms in the penitentiary.

1824
01:24:38,644 --> 01:24:39,941
Joe? This is Hartwell.

1825
01:24:40,146 --> 01:24:41,738
Come to my office right away.

1826
01:24:41,947 --> 01:24:44,882
I captured a couple of important birds.
Take their confessions.

1827
01:24:45,084 --> 01:24:46,176
Get Liebowitz.

1828
01:24:46,385 --> 01:24:48,649
The lawyers won't help you now.

1829
01:24:49,055 --> 01:24:50,622
<i>You're talking to the Morning Post.</i>

1830
01:24:50,823 --> 01:24:52,848
The power of the press?

1831
01:24:53,325 --> 01:24:56,419
Bigger men than you have found out
what the power of the press is.

1832
01:24:56,629 --> 01:24:57,926
Presidents, kings...

1833
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:00,394
- Here's the reprieve.
- Get out.

1834
01:25:00,599 --> 01:25:03,295
- You can't bribe me. My wife...
- Get out.

1835
01:25:03,502 --> 01:25:06,335
- No, I won't. Here's the reprieve.
- What?

1836
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:08,507
I don't want to be a city sealer.

1837
01:25:08,707 --> 01:25:10,231
- Throw him out.
- Out you go.

1838
01:25:10,442 --> 01:25:12,273
Wait.
Who's trying to bribe you?

1839
01:25:12,478 --> 01:25:13,877
- They wouldn't take it.
- Insane!

1840
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:16,070
What did I say? An unseen power.

1841
01:25:16,282 --> 01:25:18,648
What do you mean with a story like that?

1842
01:25:18,851 --> 01:25:20,182
He's an imposter.

1843
01:25:20,386 --> 01:25:23,150
Trying to hang an innocent man
to win an election, eh?

1844
01:25:23,355 --> 01:25:24,355
That's murder.

1845
01:25:24,423 --> 01:25:26,357
- I never saw him before.
- Lf I was to...

1846
01:25:26,559 --> 01:25:28,424
- What's your name?
- Pettibone.

1847
01:25:28,627 --> 01:25:31,152
- When did you deliver this first?
- Who'd you talk to?

1848
01:25:31,363 --> 01:25:33,024
- They started to bribe me.
- They?

1849
01:25:33,232 --> 01:25:35,496
- Those. Them.
- It's absurd on the face of it.

1850
01:25:35,701 --> 01:25:37,066
He's talking like a child.

1851
01:25:37,269 --> 01:25:39,601
- Out of the mouths of babes.
- Hi, babe.

1852
01:25:39,805 --> 01:25:40,999
He's insane or drunk.

1853
01:25:41,207 --> 01:25:45,541
If Williams has been reprieved,
I'm tickled to death. Aren't you?

1854
01:25:45,744 --> 01:25:47,575
You'd hang your mother
to be reelected.

1855
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:50,044
That's a horrible thing to say
about anybody.

1856
01:25:50,249 --> 01:25:52,513
You're marvelous.
Take a look at that.

1857
01:25:52,718 --> 01:25:54,652
- You're an intelligent man.
- Never mind.

1858
01:25:54,854 --> 01:25:56,947
Let's have your story.

1859
01:25:57,156 --> 01:25:59,716
- Nineteen years ago, I married Mrs...
- Skip all that.

1860
01:25:59,925 --> 01:26:02,951
She wasn't Mrs. Pettibone then.
She was one of the...

1861
01:26:03,162 --> 01:26:06,689
This document is authentic.
Williams has been reprieved.

1862
01:26:06,899 --> 01:26:10,198
Our commonwealth has been saved
the necessity of shedding blood.

1863
01:26:10,402 --> 01:26:13,462
<i>Get off the soapbox.
Save that for the Tribune.</i>

1864
01:26:13,672 --> 01:26:15,537
Take those handcuffs off my friends.

1865
01:26:15,741 --> 01:26:17,936
- I'm amazed at you.
- Isn't he awful?

1866
01:26:18,143 --> 01:26:20,509
You don't know how badly I feel.

1867
01:26:20,713 --> 01:26:22,544
No excuse at all for Pete.

1868
01:26:22,748 --> 01:26:24,978
- I was only doing my duty.
- That's all right.

1869
01:26:25,184 --> 01:26:27,812
- What'd you say your name was?
- Pettibone.

1870
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:30,045
- Here's a picture of my wife.
- Fine-looking woman.

1871
01:26:30,256 --> 01:26:32,156
- You haven't seen her yet.
- She's all right.

1872
01:26:32,358 --> 01:26:35,225
She's good enough for me.
If I was to tell...

1873
01:26:35,427 --> 01:26:39,022
I understand perfectly, and
as long as I am mayor...

1874
01:26:39,231 --> 01:26:40,994
Which ought to be about
Three more hours.

1875
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,930
Enough to get out a special edition
asking for your recall.

1876
01:26:44,136 --> 01:26:47,833
And your arrest. You boys
ought to get about ten years apiece.

1877
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,999
Don't make any hasty decisions.
You might run into a libel suit.

1878
01:26:52,211 --> 01:26:53,678
You'll run into the governor.

1879
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:56,607
We understand each other perfectly.

1880
01:26:56,882 --> 01:26:58,509
Yes, and so do I.

1881
01:26:58,717 --> 01:27:01,481
So do you what?
And now, Mr. Pettibone...

1882
01:27:01,687 --> 01:27:05,282
...we'll deliver this reprieve
to the warden's office. Come along.

1883
01:27:05,491 --> 01:27:08,460
- Lf I was to tell my wife...
- You won't have to.

1884
01:27:10,529 --> 01:27:12,793
<i>Wait till they read
the Morning Post tomorrow.</i>

1885
01:27:12,998 --> 01:27:13,998
Tight squeeze.

1886
01:27:14,099 --> 01:27:16,431
- Give me Duffy.
- That's the worst jam.

1887
01:27:16,635 --> 01:27:18,068
What? Where? Get him.

1888
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:21,364
Remember stealing Old Lady Haggerty's
stomach off the coroner?

1889
01:27:21,573 --> 01:27:23,871
Anytime you need this guy
he's never there.

1890
01:27:24,076 --> 01:27:26,340
We proved she'd been poisoned,
didn't we?

1891
01:27:26,545 --> 01:27:28,137
We had to hide out for a week.

1892
01:27:28,347 --> 01:27:29,507
Do you remember that?

1893
01:27:29,715 --> 01:27:32,946
The Shoreland Hotel.
That's how we happened to...

1894
01:27:33,152 --> 01:27:35,245
We could have gone
to jail for that too.

1895
01:27:35,454 --> 01:27:38,389
Yes, maybe you're right, Hildy.
It's a bad business.

1896
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:40,114
You'll be better off.

1897
01:27:40,326 --> 01:27:41,657
You better get going.

1898
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:44,385
- Where would I go?
- To Bruce, of course.

1899
01:27:44,596 --> 01:27:47,292
- You know he's gone. He took a train.
- Send a wire.

1900
01:27:47,499 --> 01:27:50,366
He'll be waiting at the station
when you get into Albany.

1901
01:27:50,569 --> 01:27:54,198
- Why doesn't he have a phone?
- I don't know. I got us messed up...

1902
01:27:54,406 --> 01:27:57,864
- Get going, Hildy.
- What is that with you?

1903
01:27:58,077 --> 01:28:00,702
Wait a minute.
Can't you understand?

1904
01:28:00,913 --> 01:28:04,474
I'm trying to do something noble.
Get out before I change my mind.

1905
01:28:04,683 --> 01:28:06,014
It's tough enough now.

1906
01:28:06,218 --> 01:28:09,153
- Just a minute.
- Send him a wire. He'll be waiting.

1907
01:28:09,355 --> 01:28:12,188
- Who'll write the story?
- I will. It won't be as good...

1908
01:28:12,391 --> 01:28:14,723
It's my story.
I like to think that it...

1909
01:28:14,927 --> 01:28:18,294
- At last.
- I get it. The same old act, isn't it?

1910
01:28:18,497 --> 01:28:21,022
Try to push me out,
thinking I'll want to stay.

1911
01:28:21,233 --> 01:28:23,895
I know I deserve that.
Wait a minute, Duffy.

1912
01:28:24,103 --> 01:28:25,502
This time you're wrong.

1913
01:28:25,704 --> 01:28:29,105
When you walk out that door,
part of me will go right with you.

1914
01:28:29,308 --> 01:28:31,367
But a whole new world
will open up for you.

1915
01:28:31,577 --> 01:28:34,375
I made fun of Bruce and Albany.
You know why?

1916
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:35,911
- Why?
- I was jealous.

1917
01:28:36,115 --> 01:28:39,949
I was sore because he could offer you
the kind of life I can't give you.

1918
01:28:40,152 --> 01:28:41,483
That's what you want, honey.

1919
01:28:41,687 --> 01:28:43,712
I could do the story
and take the train...

1920
01:28:43,922 --> 01:28:46,516
Forget it. Come on. Come on.

1921
01:28:46,725 --> 01:28:48,522
Goodbye, dear, and good luck.

1922
01:28:52,598 --> 01:28:55,863
Duffy, now this is how
it goes so far...

1923
01:28:56,068 --> 01:28:57,558
Just a minute.

1924
01:28:58,570 --> 01:29:01,061
Hello. Who? Hildy Johnson?

1925
01:29:01,273 --> 01:29:03,833
- She just left.
- I'm still here. I can take it.

1926
01:29:04,043 --> 01:29:05,442
Hang on a minute.

1927
01:29:07,546 --> 01:29:09,343
Hildy Johnson speaking.

1928
01:29:10,282 --> 01:29:12,614
The Fourth Precinct Police Station?

1929
01:29:12,818 --> 01:29:14,046
Put him on.

1930
01:29:14,953 --> 01:29:17,444
I thought you were
on your way to Albany...

1931
01:29:17,656 --> 01:29:18,656
What for?

1932
01:29:18,791 --> 01:29:20,759
For having counterfeit money.

1933
01:29:20,959 --> 01:29:22,324
Counterfeit money?

1934
01:29:22,528 --> 01:29:23,995
Hold on a minute.

1935
01:29:24,196 --> 01:29:25,754
Where did you get it?

1936
01:29:25,964 --> 01:29:27,659
I gave it to you?

1937
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:32,000
All right.
I'll try and do something about it.

1938
01:29:42,815 --> 01:29:44,009
Honey.

1939
01:29:44,883 --> 01:29:47,113
Honey, don't cry, please.

1940
01:29:47,319 --> 01:29:51,050
I didn't mean to make you cry.
What's wrong? You never cried before.

1941
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:56,527
I thought you were really
sending me away with Bruce.

1942
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:00,362
I didn't know you had him locked up.

1943
01:30:00,966 --> 01:30:04,060
I thought you were
on the level, for once.

1944
01:30:04,269 --> 01:30:07,830
That you were just standing by
and letting me go off with him...

1945
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,133
...and not doing a thing about it.

1946
01:30:10,342 --> 01:30:12,970
Come on, honey. What did you
think I was, a chump?

1947
01:30:13,178 --> 01:30:15,408
I thought you didn't love me.

1948
01:30:15,614 --> 01:30:17,206
What were you thinking with?

1949
01:30:17,416 --> 01:30:18,747
I don't know.

1950
01:30:19,718 --> 01:30:22,448
What are you standing
there gawking for?

1951
01:30:22,654 --> 01:30:24,815
We have to get him out of jail.

1952
01:30:25,023 --> 01:30:27,321
Send Louie down
with some honest money...

1953
01:30:27,526 --> 01:30:29,323
...and send him back to Albany.

1954
01:30:29,528 --> 01:30:30,790
Sure.

1955
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:34,866
Everything's changed.
We're coming over to the office.

1956
01:30:35,067 --> 01:30:37,558
Don't worry about the story.
Hildy will write it.

1957
01:30:37,769 --> 01:30:40,397
She never intended to quit.
We're getting married.

1958
01:30:40,606 --> 01:30:42,699
Can we go on a honeymoon this time?

1959
01:30:42,908 --> 01:30:43,908
Sure.

1960
01:30:44,042 --> 01:30:46,943
Duffy, you can be managing editor.

1961
01:30:47,146 --> 01:30:50,047
Not permanently.
Just for the two weeks we're away.

1962
01:30:50,249 --> 01:30:52,149
I don't know where.
Where are we going?

1963
01:30:52,351 --> 01:30:53,841
Niagara Falls.

1964
01:30:54,052 --> 01:30:56,282
- Niagara Falls.
- Two whole weeks?

1965
01:30:56,488 --> 01:30:59,286
Sure, you've earned it. What?

1966
01:30:59,491 --> 01:31:02,756
What? A strike? What strike?

1967
01:31:02,961 --> 01:31:03,961
Where?

1968
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:05,423
Albany?

1969
01:31:05,764 --> 01:31:08,824
- I know it's on the way, but...
- Okay, we'll honeymoon in Albany.

1970
01:31:09,034 --> 01:31:10,501
Okay, Duffy.

1971
01:31:11,236 --> 01:31:14,262
Isn't that a coincidence!
I wonder if Bruce can put us up.

1972
01:31:14,473 --> 01:31:16,805
Say, why don't you carry that
in your hand?
