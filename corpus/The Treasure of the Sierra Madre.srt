1
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:29,362
Say, buddy, will you stake a fellow...

2
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:48,438
Hey, mister, will you stake
a fellow American to a meal?

3
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:11,803
- State lottery, <i>señor</i>?
- Beat it. I ain't buying no lottery tickets.

4
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:13,446
4,000 pesos is the big prize.

5
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:15,803
Get away from me, you little beggar.

6
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:19,486
The whole ticket is only 4 pesos.
It's a sure winner.

7
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:21,240
I ain't got 4 pesos.

8
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:23,802
Buy a quarter of a ticket for 1 peso silver.

9
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:27,961
If you don't get away from me,
I'll throw this water right in your face.

10
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,276
Then one tenth of a ticket, <i>señor</i>, for 40...

11
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:39,521
<i>Señor</i>, buy one twentieth.
One twentieth costs you only 20 <i>centavos</i>.

12
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:42,641
Look, <i>señor</i>, add the figures up.
You get 13.

13
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:45,606
What better number could you buy?
It's a sure winner.

14
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:49,400
- Yeah, how soon's the drawing?
- Only three weeks off.

15
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:52,846
Give me a twentieth
so I don't have to look at your ugly face.

16
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:56,917
Come again next time.

17
00:02:57,008 --> 00:03:00,398
I always have the winners,
all the lucky numbers. Good luck.

18
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:01,876
Thirteen.

19
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,157
Excuse me.

20
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:25,597
Cigarette?

21
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:29,283
Thanks.

22
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:32,521
- It's hot.
- Yeah.

23
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:42,720
What a town, Tampico.

24
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,077
You said it, brother.

25
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:48,728
If I could get a job
that'd bring enough to buy passage...

26
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:51,561
I'd shake its dust off my feet
soon enough, you bet.

27
00:03:52,488 --> 00:03:54,843
If I was a native,
I'd get a can of shoe polish...

28
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:57,601
and I'd be in business.
They'd never let a gringo.

29
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:01,482
You can sit on a bench
till you're three-quarters starved.

30
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:04,321
You can beg from another gringo,
or even commit burglary.

31
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:06,285
You try shining shoes in the street...

32
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:09,360
or peddling lemonade out of a bucket
and your hash is settled.

33
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:11,484
You'll never get another job
from an American.

34
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:14,366
Yeah, and the natives
would hound and pester you to death.

35
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:17,201
- Some town to be broke in.
- What town isn't?

36
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:25,802
Can you stake a fellow American
to a meal?

37
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,717
Hey, mister.

38
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:03,918
Will you stake a fellow American
to a meal?

39
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:05,919
Such impudence never came my way.

40
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:07,726
Early this afternoon, I gave you money.

41
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:09,958
When my shoes were being polished,
I gave you more.

42
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:11,640
Now you put the bite on me again.

43
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:13,878
Do me a favor.
Go occasionally to somebody else.

44
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:17,404
- It's beginning to get tiresome.
- Excuse me. I didn't know it was you.

45
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:20,719
I never looked at your face, just
your hands and the money you gave me.

46
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:23,641
Beg pardon. I promise
I'll never put the bite on you again.

47
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:25,559
This is the very last you get from me.

48
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:29,243
Just to make sure you don't forget
your promise, here's another peso.

49
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:31,319
- Thanks, mister.
- But from now on...

50
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:34,764
you have to make your way through life
without my assistance.

51
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,405
Hey, buddy, will you stake
a fellow American to a meal?

52
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:47,161
I won't give you a red cent.

53
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:49,557
If you want to make some money
I'll give you a job.

54
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:51,479
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.

55
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:54,082
I got a job if you want.
It's hard work, but good pay.

56
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:55,999
- Did you ever rig a camp?
- Sure.

57
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:58,397
The ferry's making off,
one of my men hasn't shown up.

58
00:06:58,488 --> 00:07:01,605
I don't know what's happened to him.
He's probably drunk in some dive.

59
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,156
- What's the pay?
- $8 a day.

60
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:08,516
Don't just stand there.
Make up your mind, the ferry doesn't wait.

61
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:10,405
- I'm your man.
- Come on.

62
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:27,838
- Hello, there.
- Hello, yourself.

63
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:30,279
Okay, you guys, get aboard.

64
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:44,526
Take it your way.

65
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:15,486
What's the matter with you two?
Can't you take it?

66
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:19,004
It's 130 in the shade, and there ain't
any shade up there on that derrick.

67
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:22,922
Just figure you're a couple of millionaires
in your own private steam bath.

68
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:24,527
And the sooner we're through...

69
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:27,566
the sooner we'll be back in town
drinking cold beer.

70
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:30,606
We finish within two weeks,
I'm giving you fellas a bonus.

71
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:33,725
Yeah, it's coming to us
working 16, 18 hours a day like we do.

72
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:35,799
Don't go crying to your mamas.
What do you want?

73
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:38,004
I'm paying top salaries and a bonus.

74
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:40,283
What about our pay anyway,
and when do we get it?

75
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:43,599
- I ain't seen a buck out of you yet.
- You'll get your dough, all right...

76
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:46,248
don't worry about that,
when we get back to Tampico.

77
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:49,718
What could you do with money out here
anyway, except gamble and lose it?

78
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:51,958
You'll be paid as we step off the ferry.

79
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:16,278
The agent was supposed to be here
with the dough.

80
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:17,767
Don't know what could've happened.

81
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,646
But don't worry.
I'll go to the office and pick up the money.

82
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,127
You men stay here.

83
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,358
Any objection to a couple of us
coming with you?

84
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:26,518
Don't you trust me?
You think I'd run out on you?

85
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,121
I don't think you'd do that.

86
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:32,087
But I ain't got a cent, not even enough
to buy me a glass of beer.

87
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:35,679
Say, you two guys meet me
over at the Cantina Madrid.

88
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:38,840
It's 2:15 now and I'll be over there
no later than 3:00.

89
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:45,287
Pat McCormick.
He comes here from time to time.

90
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:46,517
I haven't seen him lately.

91
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,758
Pat McCormick?
What about Pat McCormick?

92
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:51,965
- He's supposed to meet us here.
- Does he owe you any money?

93
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:55,287
Say, how long you guys
been around Tampico, anyway?

94
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:56,926
What's that got to do with it?

95
00:09:57,008 --> 00:10:00,478
Only foreigners and half-baked Americans
fall for McCormick's tricks.

96
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:01,603
How do you mean?

97
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:04,122
I mean, he hires dumb guys like you
to work for him.

98
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,927
When it comes time to pay off,
he takes a powder.

99
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:13,480
How much we got left
of that $10 he gave us, Dobbsie?

100
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:17,004
- $2.50.
- That's not even enough for one bed.

101
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:22,040
I know a joint that's full of rats,
scorpions and cockroaches.

102
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:26,047
The cots are only 50 <i>centavos</i> a night.

103
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:31,967
Have another...

104
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:46,481
...jobs that were a dime a dozen
ain't to be had at all.

105
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:47,637
Streets are full of guys...

106
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:49,846
pushing each other over a meal.

107
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:52,840
Gold in Mexico? Sure there is.
Not 10 days from here by rail.

108
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:57,206
The mountain's waiting for the right guy
to discover and take her treasure.

109
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:59,324
The question is: Are you the right guy?

110
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,366
Real bonanzas are few and far between.
They take a lot of finding.

111
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:05,520
Answer me this, will you?
Why is gold worth some $20 an ounce?

112
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:09,237
- I don't know. Because it's scarce.
- A thousand men go searching for gold.

113
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:12,081
After six months one of them's lucky.
One out of the thousand.

114
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:16,161
His find represents not only his own labor
but that of 999 others to boot.

115
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:19,485
That's 6,000 months, 500 years...

116
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:22,036
scrambling over mountain,
going hungry and thirsty.

117
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:26,326
The gold is worth what it is 'cause of
the human labor that went into finding it.

118
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:29,286
- Never thought of it like that.
- There's no other explanation.

119
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:33,077
Gold ain't good for nothing
except for making jewelry and gold teeth.

120
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:34,567
Gold's a devilish sort of thing.

121
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:38,357
You start out to tell yourself
you'll be satisfied with $25,000 worth.

122
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,246
So help me Lord and cross my heart.
Fine resolution.

123
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:44,798
After months of sweating yourself dizzy,
few provisions, finding nothing...

124
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:46,958
you finally come down to $15,000,
then $10,000.

125
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:50,040
Finally you say,
"Lord, let me just find $5,000 worth...

126
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:52,642
"and I'll never ask for anything more
the rest of my life."

127
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:54,639
$5,000 is a lot of money.

128
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:56,840
In this joint it seems like a lot.

129
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,647
But if you made a real strike,
you couldn't be dragged away.

130
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:02,879
Even the threat of death wouldn't
keep you from adding $10,000 more.

131
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:05,641
$10,000, you'd want $25,000.
$25,000, you'd want $50,000.

132
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:07,480
$50,000, $100,000. Like roulette.

133
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:09,763
One more turn, you know.
Always one more.

134
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:12,965
It wouldn't be that way with me.
I swear, it wouldn't.

135
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:15,523
I'd take only what I set out to get.

136
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:18,042
Even if there was still $500,000 worth...

137
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,119
lying around, waiting to be picked up.

138
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,517
I've dug in Alaska
and Canada and Colorado.

139
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,441
I was in the British Honduras,
I made my fare back home...

140
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:28,042
and almost enough over
to cure me of the fever I'd caught.

141
00:12:28,128 --> 00:12:31,723
Dug in California and Australia.
All over the world practically.

142
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:34,482
Yeah. I know what gold does
to men's souls.

143
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:37,801
You talk as though you struck it rich
sometime or other, pop.

144
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:39,162
How about it?

145
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:42,516
Then what are you doing in here,
a down-and-outer?

146
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,838
That's gold. That's what it makes us.

147
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:47,396
Never knew a prospector yet
that died rich.

148
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:50,321
Make one fortune, he's sure to blow it
trying to find another.

149
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:52,399
I'm no exception to the rule.

150
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:57,727
Sure I'm a gnawed old bone now
but don't you guys think the spirit's gone.

151
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:01,204
I'm set to shoulder a pickaxe
if anybody's willing to share expenses.

152
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:03,483
I'd rather go by myself.
It's best to go alone.

153
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:06,958
But you got to have a stomach
for loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it.

154
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:10,358
But going with a partner is dangerous.
Murder is always lurking about.

155
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:13,281
Partners accusing each other
of all sorts of crimes.

156
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:18,046
As long as there's no find,
the noble brotherhood will last.

157
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:22,280
But when the piles of gold begin to grow,
that's when the trouble starts.

158
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:27,085
I wouldn't mind
a little of that kind of trouble.

159
00:13:27,488 --> 00:13:29,479
I think I'll go to sleep...

160
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,122
and dream about piles of gold...

161
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,564
getting bigger and bigger.

162
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:42,601
Do you believe what the old man...

163
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,963
who was doing all the talking
at the Oso Negro...

164
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:46,640
said the other night...

165
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:50,277
about gold changing a man's soul
so that he ain't the same kind of a guy...

166
00:13:50,368 --> 00:13:52,836
that he was before finding it?

167
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:54,680
Guess that all depends on the man.

168
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,645
That's exactly what I say.

169
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:58,999
Gold don't carry any curse with it.

170
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:03,127
It all depends on whether or not
the guy who finds it is the right guy.

171
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:04,796
The way I see it...

172
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:07,482
gold can be as much of a blessing
as a curse.

173
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:13,202
Look who's coming out
of the Hotel Bristol.

174
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,722
Is that Pat McCormick
or am I seeing things?

175
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:21,962
It's him.

176
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:24,482
- Let's get him.
- Let's get him hard.

177
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:27,527
Why don't you and me
go and buy me something?

178
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:29,838
I could use a new pair of shoes.

179
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:32,159
Hello, fellows, how are you?
Glad to see you.

180
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:34,842
- Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Curtin, <i>Señorita</i>...
- López.

181
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:37,442
López. I want you guys
to come and have a drink with me.

182
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:40,326
I've got business
to attend to with these men.

183
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:43,002
You go back up the hotel and wait.
I won't be long.

184
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:45,758
Okay.

185
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:48,316
Fellas, let's have that drink.
Where have you been?

186
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:50,444
I've been looking all over for you.

187
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,167
Three shots of rye.

188
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:57,840
Make mine brandy, Three Star.

189
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:00,362
- Two brandies.
- Rye is good enough for me.

190
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:03,799
I suppose you're wondering
about that money that's coming to you.

191
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:06,846
The fact is I haven't been paid off
on that contract myself.

192
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:10,921
If I had the money, you'd get it first thing.
I'll put you both on my next contract.

193
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:13,602
It will come through by Monday
and we can set out Friday.

194
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:15,246
Here's mud in your eye.

195
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:20,807
We want what's coming to us.
We want it right here and now.

196
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:23,243
- But didn't I just tell you...
- You better come across.

197
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:26,365
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you 25º% .

198
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:27,767
I guess I can make it 30º% .

199
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:29,645
And the balance, say,
the middle of next week?

200
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,081
Nothing doing. Right here and now.

201
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:34,160
Every cent or you won't walk out of here.
You'll be carried out.

202
00:15:34,248 --> 00:15:36,887
Let's don't stop being friends.
How about another drink?

203
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:39,243
Two more brandies.
Put the bottle on the bar.

204
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:41,239
If you want to get us liquored up...

205
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:44,843
No, I'm just inviting you
to have a friendly drink with me.

206
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:50,843
- I'm licked, boys.
- Give us our money.

207
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:53,318
Yeah, give us our money.

208
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:58,287
I can't see.

209
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:05,083
$50. $100.

210
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:07,083
$200.

211
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,163
$300.

212
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:12,036
- That's it, ain't it, Curt?
- Yeah, that's it.

213
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:16,358
Let's beat it before the law arrives.

214
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:21,808
Here's for the drinks
and the use of the <i>cantina</i>.

215
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:28,204
- You know something, Curt?
- What?

216
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:32,805
We ain't very smart,
hanging around Tampico waiting for a job.

217
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:34,887
Money's getting shorter every day...

218
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:37,880
and soon we'll be right back
where we were, on the bum again...

219
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:41,324
pushing guys for dimes,
sleeping around in freight cars.

220
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:43,640
That's right. Got any ideas?

221
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:47,641
That old man in the Oso Negro
started me to thinking.

222
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:48,683
What about?

223
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,077
Why not try gold-digging for a change?

224
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:53,762
It ain't any riskier
than waiting around here for a break...

225
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:57,045
and this is the country where the nuggets
of gold are crying for you...

226
00:17:57,128 --> 00:18:00,882
to take them out of the ground,
make them shinin' coins...

227
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:04,361
on the fingers and necks of swell dames.

228
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:08,044
One thing, living in the open is cheaper
than it is here in Tampico.

229
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,038
Our money'd last longer.

230
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:12,643
The longer it lasts, the greater our chance
of digging something up would be.

231
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:14,480
We'd have to have equipment, all right.

232
00:18:14,568 --> 00:18:18,720
Picks and spades, pans, burros.
Wonder how much it would all cost.

233
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:22,125
- That old man would know.
- Yeah, he could give us some pointers.

234
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,405
He's too old to take along.
We'd have to pack him on our backs.

235
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:27,240
You can't tell
about some of those old guys.

236
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:29,967
It's surprising sometimes
how tough they are.

237
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:32,278
I don't know what gold looks like
in the ground.

238
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:35,804
I've only seen it in jewelry store windows
and people's mouths.

239
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,278
You know anything about prospecting?

240
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:40,804
Not much when you come right down to it.

241
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:43,800
We might have real use
for an experienced guy like that old-timer.

242
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:45,879
Let's go hunt him up right away.

243
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:50,288
Will I go? What a question.
Of course I'll go.

244
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:52,836
Any time, any day,
I was waiting for somebody to ask me.

245
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:55,203
Out for gold? I'm always at your service.

246
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:58,724
I got $300 ready cash in the bank.
$200 of it all set to invest.

247
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:01,197
Last money I got.
When it's gone, I'm finished.

248
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:03,324
If you don't take a risk,
you can't make a gain.

249
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,966
How much dough you guys got to put in?

250
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:07,482
I've got $150 and Curtin's got the same.

251
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:11,038
$500 ain't hardly enough to buy tools,
weapons and essential provisions.

252
00:19:11,128 --> 00:19:12,356
What do we need weapons for?

253
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:14,279
Meat's one thing and bandits another.

254
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:17,405
Bandit country's where we'd be going.
We need $600 between us.

255
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:19,718
- That much?
- Can't you dig up any more?

256
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:21,396
Not a red cent.

257
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:26,447
Give me my money, <i>señor</i>!

258
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:28,519
10º% I get for selling the winning ticket.

259
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:29,677
Get away from me, will you?

260
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,804
Please, <i>señor</i>.
Whoever draws the lucky number...

261
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:33,401
gives a present to the seller...

262
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:34,807
I don't want any lottery ticket!

263
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:37,641
If you don't, you have bad luck
the rest of your life.

264
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:40,686
What? Wait a minute.
What did you first say?

265
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:44,078
Why, he's trying to tell you
he sold you the winning ticket.

266
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:45,926
Hey, wait a minute.

267
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:47,801
This what you mean?

268
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,438
- You say it's the winner?
- 200 peso prize.

269
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,041
Where?

270
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:54,766
- That's my number.
- Sure enough.

271
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:57,840
Just look at that fat, rich, printed number.

272
00:19:57,968 --> 00:20:02,086
That's the kind of sugar poppa likes.
200 pesos.

273
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,443
Welcome, sweet little smackeroos.

274
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:07,282
Here, son, here's a present for you
with my blessing.

275
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:12,722
Would you like to shake the hand
that bought that ticket?

276
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:14,799
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, yourself.

277
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:17,083
You stand to profit out of this
the same as I do.

278
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:18,123
How do you make that out?

279
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,484
Didn't he just say we needed $600?
That's what we've got now, ain't it?

280
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:22,637
- Yeah, but...
- But what?

281
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:25,925
- Why are you putting up for me?
- This is an all-or-nothing proposition.

282
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:29,523
If we make a find,
we'll be lighting our cigars with $100 bills.

283
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:32,042
If not, the difference
between what you and I put up...

284
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:34,801
ain't enough to keep me
from being where I was this afternoon:

285
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:37,277
Polishing a bench
with the seat of my pants.

286
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:38,926
Put her there, part.

287
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:56,884
We'll buy our burros at Perla and
head northwest away from the railroad.

288
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:58,560
It's no use looking near a railroad...

289
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,001
or any kind of a road at all...

290
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:03,637
because construction engineers examine
every bit of ground around the road...

291
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:04,843
while they're building them.

292
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:06,520
We got to go where there's no trails...

293
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:10,806
where no surveyor or anyone who knows
anything of prospecting has been before.

294
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:12,207
The best place to go to is...

295
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:16,440
where any salaried person wouldn't go,
because he wouldn't want to risk his hide.

296
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,919
I got three of them!
How many did you get?

297
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:21,363
- A couple.
- I'm one up. I bet I got more than you did.

298
00:22:21,448 --> 00:22:22,676
I got three. Nice shooting?

299
00:22:22,768 --> 00:22:25,487
That bullet hole's two inches
from my head. That was close.

300
00:22:25,568 --> 00:22:27,763
The bullets were sure flying
thick and fast in here.

301
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,406
It sounded like a swarm of bees here.

302
00:22:29,488 --> 00:22:32,844
That bandit with the gold hat,
I had my sights on him, nice as you please.

303
00:22:32,928 --> 00:22:35,283
The train gave a jolt and I missed.
Wish I'd got him.

304
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:37,598
Big boulder on the track so train stop.

305
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:41,203
Bandits got big surprise because soldiers
on the train waiting for them.

306
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:42,641
Not many passengers get killed.

307
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,286
Here's where we're bound for.

308
00:22:44,368 --> 00:22:46,643
Don't show whether there's mountain,
swamp or desert.

309
00:22:46,728 --> 00:22:48,958
That shows the makers of the map
don't know.

310
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:51,437
Once on the ground,
we open our eyes and look around.

311
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:54,247
Blow our noses, too.
Believe it or not, I knew a fellow...

312
00:22:54,328 --> 00:22:57,047
who could smell gold
like a jackass can smell water.

313
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:46,162
What's all that about?

314
00:23:46,248 --> 00:23:48,398
We're going into country
very wild and dangerous.

315
00:23:48,488 --> 00:23:49,682
Have to cut through jungles...

316
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:52,407
and climb mountains so high
they rise above the clouds.

317
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:56,367
Tigers so strong they can climb trees
with burros in their mouths. Good.

318
00:23:56,448 --> 00:24:00,202
Glad to hear such tall tales 'cause it
means few outsiders have set foot there.

319
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:02,006
Well, let's get going.

320
00:25:06,808 --> 00:25:10,437
If there was gold in them mountains,
how long would it have been there?

321
00:25:10,528 --> 00:25:13,167
Millions and millions of years, wouldn't it?

322
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:14,761
What's our hurry?

323
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:18,678
A couple of days more or less
ain't going to make any difference.

324
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,038
Remember what you said
back in Tampico...

325
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:24,086
about having to pack that old man
on our backs?

326
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:30,404
That was when I took him
for an ordinary human being...

327
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:32,047
not part goat.

328
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:34,844
Look at him climb, will you?

329
00:25:39,728 --> 00:25:43,038
What gets me is how he can go all day
in the sun without any water.

330
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:45,119
Maybe he's part camel, too.

331
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:47,804
If I'd known what prospecting meant...

332
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:51,676
I'd have stayed in Tampico
and waited for another job to turn up.

333
00:25:57,968 --> 00:26:00,323
- What's the matter?
- Look.

334
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:05,723
Look at it glitter. It's yellow, too, like...

335
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:07,077
Gold.

336
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:15,077
Come back, we've found something!

337
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:20,040
Look, Curt, there's a vein of it,
here, in this rock.

338
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:23,318
Look here. Look, it's all around.

339
00:26:23,768 --> 00:26:25,247
What else could it be?

340
00:26:25,448 --> 00:26:27,803
Only gold shines and glitters like that.

341
00:26:28,568 --> 00:26:30,160
We've struck it, Curt.

342
00:26:31,928 --> 00:26:34,317
Look, from the looks of things...

343
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:37,006
we've struck it rich.

344
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:39,200
Look, it's all over here.

345
00:26:39,408 --> 00:26:41,399
- We found a what do you call it...
- Mother lode.

346
00:26:41,488 --> 00:26:42,557
- That's right.
- Howard!

347
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:43,842
Come on. Look.

348
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:47,605
Here, look at this rock.
It's full of gold. Veins of it.

349
00:26:48,168 --> 00:26:50,966
This stuff wouldn't pay your dinner
for a carload.

350
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:53,087
It ain't gold?

351
00:26:53,288 --> 00:26:54,880
Pyrite. Fool's gold.

352
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:57,398
Not that there ain't
plenty of the real stuff here.

353
00:26:57,488 --> 00:26:59,365
We've walked over it four or five times.

354
00:26:59,448 --> 00:27:01,837
A place yesterday looked like
rich diggings, but the water...

355
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:03,646
for washing the sand was 11 miles away.

356
00:27:03,728 --> 00:27:07,164
The other places, there wasn't much gold
to pay us a good day's wages.

357
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:09,557
Next time you strike it rich, holler for me...

358
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:12,321
before you start splashing water around.
Water's precious.

359
00:27:12,408 --> 00:27:14,842
Sometimes it can be more precious
than gold.

360
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:16,517
Burro.

361
00:27:27,768 --> 00:27:29,918
- What's up?
- Norther, looks like.

362
00:27:30,288 --> 00:27:32,085
A "norther"? What's a "norther"?

363
00:27:32,608 --> 00:27:34,724
Big winds from the north
this time of year...

364
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:38,642
when they blow hard, this desert country
stands right up on its hind legs!

365
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:50,082
There's only a few more miles
of this heavy stuff.

366
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,477
Pretty soon we'll be out of this valley.

367
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:33,484
You fellows, how about some beans?

368
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,527
You want some beans?

369
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:45,281
Going through some mighty rough country
tomorrow. You better have some beans.

370
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:26,200
You know what I'm thinking?

371
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,844
I'm thinking we ought to give up...

372
00:29:29,128 --> 00:29:30,800
leave the whole outfit...

373
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:32,767
everything behind.

374
00:29:33,368 --> 00:29:35,120
Go back to civilization.

375
00:29:35,248 --> 00:29:38,797
What's that you say? Go back?
Tell my old grandmother!

376
00:29:38,888 --> 00:29:41,846
I got two elegant bedfellows
who kick at the first drop of rain...

377
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:44,317
and hide in the closet
when thunder rumbles.

378
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,841
What great prospectors.

379
00:29:45,928 --> 00:29:48,237
Two shoe clerks reading
about prospecting for gold...

380
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,638
in the Land of the Midnight Sun,
south of the border or west of the Rockies.

381
00:29:51,728 --> 00:29:53,844
Shut your trap or I'll smash your head flat!

382
00:29:53,928 --> 00:29:56,965
Go ahead, throw it. If you did,
you'd never leave this place alive.

383
00:29:57,048 --> 00:29:59,960
Without me, you two would die here
more miserable than rats.

384
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,801
Leave him alone.
Can't you see the old man's nuts?

385
00:30:03,808 --> 00:30:06,561
Nuts, am I? Let me tell you something,
my fine bedfellows.

386
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:10,084
There's nothing to compare you with.
You're dumber than the dumbest jackass.

387
00:30:10,168 --> 00:30:11,123
Look at each other.

388
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:14,644
Did you ever see anything like yourself
for being dumb specimens?

389
00:30:18,168 --> 00:30:19,123
You're so dumb...

390
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:22,803
you don't even see the riches
you're treading on with your own feet.

391
00:30:30,768 --> 00:30:33,043
Don't expect to find nuggets
of molten gold.

392
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:35,278
It's not that rich.
Here ain't the place to dig.

393
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:37,757
It comes from someplace further up.
Up there.

394
00:30:37,848 --> 00:30:39,884
Up there's where we've got to go.

395
00:30:46,408 --> 00:30:48,399
- Is that it?
- That's it, all right.

396
00:30:48,488 --> 00:30:49,716
Gold, I mean.

397
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,446
Sure don't look like I thought it would.

398
00:30:51,528 --> 00:30:54,964
- Not much different from sand.
- Yeah. It's just like plain sand.

399
00:30:55,128 --> 00:30:56,686
It don't glitter. I thought it would.

400
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,998
It will when it's refined by some other guy.

401
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:01,204
All we got to do is mine it
and get it back there.

402
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:04,644
Gold ain't like stones in a riverbed.
It don't cry out to be picked up.

403
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:06,241
You got to know how to recognize it.

404
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,159
The finding ain't all. Not by a long shot.

405
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:10,762
Got to know how to tickle her
so she'll come out laughing.

406
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,759
Yeah, it's mighty rich. It'll pay good.

407
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:15,282
- How good?
- About 20 ounces to the ton.

408
00:31:15,488 --> 00:31:18,241
- That's $20 an ounce.
- How many tons can we handle a week?

409
00:31:18,328 --> 00:31:19,602
Depends on how hard we work.

410
00:31:19,688 --> 00:31:21,679
We better pitch our camp
down the mountainside.

411
00:31:21,768 --> 00:31:23,167
Why, when the digging's here?

412
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,126
Anyone comes by, we say we're hunters,
and get away with it maybe.

413
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,200
- Wouldn't it be easier to file a claim?
- Easier but not so profitable.

414
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:32,360
An emissary from a big mining company
would be here soon...

415
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:35,360
with a paper in his hand
showing we had no right to be here.

416
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:40,078
How does it feel to be men of property?

417
00:31:44,248 --> 00:31:45,761
The tanks'll leak some at first...

418
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:48,681
until the boards begin to swell
and close the seams.

419
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:54,039
I sure had some cockeyed ideas
about prospecting for gold.

420
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:56,284
It was all in the finding, I thought.

421
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,406
I thought you just had to find it,
pick it up, put it in sacks...

422
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:02,319
and carry them off to the nearest bank.

423
00:32:02,408 --> 00:32:05,366
You're learning. Pretty soon
I won't be able to tell you a thing.

424
00:32:05,448 --> 00:32:07,439
- Tank full yet?
- Right to the top.

425
00:32:07,528 --> 00:32:09,007
Open the sluice gate.

426
00:32:44,888 --> 00:32:47,038
How much do you figure it to be now?

427
00:32:47,928 --> 00:32:49,680
About $5,000 worth, I reckon.

428
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:54,243
When are we going to start dividing it up?

429
00:32:56,728 --> 00:32:58,047
Anytime you say.

430
00:32:58,128 --> 00:33:00,801
Why divide it at all? I don't see any point.

431
00:33:00,888 --> 00:33:03,083
We're all going back together
when the time comes.

432
00:33:03,168 --> 00:33:06,001
Why not wait till we get paid
and then divide the money?

433
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:08,204
Either way suits me. You fellows decide.

434
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:10,597
I'm for dividing it up as we go along.

435
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:13,967
Make each guy responsible
for his own goods.

436
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:16,079
I'd just as soon have it that way.

437
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:18,966
I don't like the responsibility
of guarding your treasure.

438
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:20,367
Who asked you to?

439
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:23,198
That's right. You never asked me.

440
00:33:23,288 --> 00:33:26,200
Only, I thought I was the most trustworthy
of the three.

441
00:33:26,328 --> 00:33:27,363
You?

442
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:29,883
How come?

443
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,842
I said the most trustworthy. As far as
being the most honest, no one can say.

444
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:36,287
I don't get you.

445
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:38,677
Suppose you're charged
of taking care of the goods.

446
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:42,078
One day I'm deep in the brush
and Curtin's on his way to get provisions.

447
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:44,966
That'd be your chance to pack up
and leave us in the cold.

448
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:49,246
Only a guy that's a thief at heart would
think me likely to do a thing like that.

449
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:51,765
Right now, it wouldn't be
worth your while...

450
00:33:51,848 --> 00:33:55,761
but when the pile's grown to 300 ounces,
think of such things you will.

451
00:33:56,648 --> 00:33:58,161
How's about yourself?

452
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:00,481
I'm not quick on my feet any longer.

453
00:34:00,568 --> 00:34:02,604
You're a lot tougher
than when we started out.

454
00:34:02,688 --> 00:34:05,077
By the time the pile's grown
to be really tempting...

455
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,920
I won't be able to run half as fast as you.

456
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:09,078
You'd catch me
and string me up in no time.

457
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:11,477
That's why I think
I'm the most trustworthy.

458
00:34:11,568 --> 00:34:13,638
Looking at it that way,
I guess you're right.

459
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:15,559
Maybe it'd be a good idea...

460
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:17,798
to cut the proceeds up
three ways every night.

461
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:20,197
It'll relieve you of a responsibility
you don't like.

462
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,403
Swell by me.

463
00:34:21,488 --> 00:34:23,080
After we got a couple of hundred ounces...

464
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:25,523
it'll be a nuisance
carrying bags around our necks.

465
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:28,600
Each of us will have to hide his share
from the others.

466
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:33,079
And after that, he'll have to be forever
on watch that his hiding place's not found.

467
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:35,363
What a dirty, filthy mind you've got.

468
00:34:36,288 --> 00:34:39,166
Not dirty, baby.
Only I know what kind of ideas...

469
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:42,081
even supposedly decent people get
when gold's at stake.

470
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,357
All right.

471
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:46,440
Here she goes three ways.

472
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,363
Dobbs!

473
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:02,121
Howard, come quick!

474
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,561
He's coming around.

475
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,927
Lay still a minute
till you get your senses back.

476
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,042
What happened?

477
00:37:18,688 --> 00:37:20,724
Part of the mine caved in on you.

478
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,966
Got a knock on the head.

479
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,567
No bones broken?

480
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:33,001
I don't think so.

481
00:37:33,728 --> 00:37:35,844
- Who pulled me out?
- Curtin did.

482
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:40,399
I owe my life to you, partner.

483
00:37:41,688 --> 00:37:42,757
Forget it.

484
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:56,838
What'll you do
with your hard-earned money...

485
00:37:56,928 --> 00:37:58,566
when we get back and cash in?

486
00:37:58,648 --> 00:38:01,321
I'm getting along in years.
I can still hold up my end...

487
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:04,445
when it comes to a hard day's work,
but I'm not the man I was once.

488
00:38:04,528 --> 00:38:08,043
Next year, next month, next week,
by thunder, won't be the man I'm today.

489
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,005
I think I'll settle down in a quiet place...

490
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,363
get a little business, hardware,
grocery store...

491
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:15,565
spend the better part of my time
reading comics and adventure stories.

492
00:38:15,648 --> 00:38:18,037
One thing's for sure.
I won't go prospecting again...

493
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:20,562
wasting time and money
trying to find another gold mine.

494
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:22,684
How about yourself?
What plans have you, if any?

495
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:25,726
I figure on buying some land
and growing fruit. Peaches, maybe.

496
00:38:25,808 --> 00:38:28,003
How did you come to settle on peaches?

497
00:38:28,368 --> 00:38:29,687
One summer, when I was a kid...

498
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:32,760
I worked as a picker in a peach harvest
in the San Joaquin Valley.

499
00:38:33,448 --> 00:38:35,279
Boy, it sure was something.

500
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:37,445
Hundreds of people, old and young.

501
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:39,639
Whole families working together.

502
00:38:39,808 --> 00:38:41,446
At night, after a day's work...

503
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,838
we used to build big bonfires
and sit around and sing to guitar music.

504
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:46,999
Till morning sometimes.

505
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:50,918
We'd go to sleep, wake up and sing,
and go to sleep again.

506
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:53,719
Everybody had a wonderful time.

507
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:57,686
Ever since then I've had a hankering
to be a fruit grower.

508
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,601
It must be grand
watching your own trees put on leaves...

509
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:02,644
come into blossom and bear.

510
00:39:02,728 --> 00:39:06,687
Watching the fruit get big
and ripe on the boughs, ready for picking.

511
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:10,405
What's all that about?

512
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,526
We're telling each other
what we aim to do when we get back.

513
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:17,198
Now me, I got it all figured out
what I'm gonna do.

514
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,165
Tell us about it, Dobbsie.

515
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:22,206
First off, I'm going to a Turkish bath
to sweat and soak...

516
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:25,325
till I get all the grime and dirt
out of my system.

517
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:29,363
Then I'm going to a haberdasher and
gonna get myself a brand-new set of duds.

518
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:30,847
Dozen of everything.

519
00:39:31,128 --> 00:39:33,517
Then I'm going to a swell cafe...

520
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:37,120
order everything on the bill o' fare
and if it ain't just right...

521
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,642
or maybe even if it is,
I'm gonna bawl the waiter out...

522
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:41,798
and make him take the whole thing back.

523
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:43,447
What's next on the program?

524
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,680
Well, what would be?

525
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:58,564
If I were you, I wouldn't talk
or think about women.

526
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:00,684
It ain't good for your health.

527
00:40:01,248 --> 00:40:04,797
Yeah, maybe you're right,
seeing how the prospects are far off.

528
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:06,082
You know what?

529
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,768
We ought to put a limit on our take,
agree between us...

530
00:40:08,848 --> 00:40:10,918
when we get so much
we pull up stakes and beat it.

531
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,205
- What do you think the limit ought to be?
- Say $25,000 worth apiece.

532
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:16,756
$25,000, small potatoes.

533
00:40:17,288 --> 00:40:18,357
How much do you say?

534
00:40:18,448 --> 00:40:20,962
$50,000 anyway,
$75,000 would be more like it.

535
00:40:21,048 --> 00:40:24,165
That'd take a year if the vein held out,
which wouldn't be likely.

536
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:27,524
What's a year more or less
when that kind of money is to be had?

537
00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:30,042
$25,000 is plenty as far as I'm concerned.

538
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,005
Enough to last me the rest of my lifetime.

539
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:34,477
Well, sure, you're old, I'm young.

540
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:36,365
I need dough and plenty of it.

541
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:39,001
$25,000 in one piece...

542
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,079
is more than I ever expected
to get my hands on.

543
00:40:41,168 --> 00:40:42,203
Small potatoes.

544
00:40:42,288 --> 00:40:44,404
There's no use making hogs of ourselves.

545
00:40:45,728 --> 00:40:46,956
Hog, am I?

546
00:40:47,088 --> 00:40:49,283
Maybe you don't know,
but I'd be within my rights...

547
00:40:49,368 --> 00:40:51,802
if I demanded half again
as much as you get.

548
00:40:51,888 --> 00:40:52,843
How come?

549
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:55,726
There's no denying I put up
the lion's share of the cash.

550
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,845
So you did, Dobbsie,
and I always meant to pay you back.

551
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:02,716
In any civilized place the biggest investor
gets the biggest return, don't he?

552
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:05,238
That's one thing in favor of the wilds.

553
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:08,918
Not that I intended to demand it,
but I'd be within my rights if I did.

554
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,919
Next time you call me a hog
just remember...

555
00:41:11,008 --> 00:41:12,600
what I could've done if I'd wanted to.

556
00:41:12,688 --> 00:41:15,725
I think it'd be wise not to put things
strictly on a money basis.

557
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:18,800
Here you are, Dobbs.
What I owe you with interest.

558
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:30,042
I just don't like being called a hog,
that's all.

559
00:42:10,848 --> 00:42:13,203
Don't scare me like that.
I might have let you have it.

560
00:42:13,288 --> 00:42:14,721
Out for a midnight stroll?

561
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:16,764
Tiger around,
I went to check on the burros.

562
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:18,725
- So?
- What's the matter?

563
00:42:18,808 --> 00:42:22,483
- I think I'll see if the burros are all right.
- Go ahead. Help yourself.

564
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:38,526
- What's up?
- Nothing's up.

565
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,002
Where is Dobbs?

566
00:42:43,088 --> 00:42:45,522
Poking around in the dark out there.

567
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,199
He's sure taking a long time out there.

568
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:54,038
I think I'll go have a look-see.

569
00:43:16,008 --> 00:43:17,487
Where's Curtin?

570
00:43:18,368 --> 00:43:21,565
He's out there somewhere.
Said he was gonna have a look-see.

571
00:43:48,728 --> 00:43:50,480
It's my turn again but I won't take it...

572
00:43:50,568 --> 00:43:53,082
if you stop worrying
about your goods and go to bed.

573
00:43:53,168 --> 00:43:54,840
We got work to do tomorrow.

574
00:44:07,168 --> 00:44:10,365
Can't catch me sleeping.
Don't you ever believe that.

575
00:44:11,488 --> 00:44:12,921
I'm not that dumb.

576
00:44:14,168 --> 00:44:16,124
The day you try to put anything
over on me...

577
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,676
it'll be a costly one for both of you.

578
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:32,157
Any more lip out of you
and I'll up and let you have it.

579
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:37,798
If you know what's good for you, you
won't monkey around with Fred C. Dobbs.

580
00:44:41,408 --> 00:44:44,320
You ought to see Dobbs.
He's talking to himself a mile a minute.

581
00:44:44,408 --> 00:44:46,638
Something's eating him all right,
I don't know what.

582
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:48,639
He's just spoiling for trouble.

583
00:44:55,928 --> 00:44:58,078
"We're running short of provisions,
Dobbsie.

584
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:00,318
"How about you going to the village?"

585
00:45:00,808 --> 00:45:02,878
Who does Howard think he is,
ordering me around?

586
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:04,162
What's that, Dobbs?

587
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:05,522
- Nothing.
- Better look out.

588
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:07,564
It's a bad sign when a guy talks to himself.

589
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:09,286
Yeah? Who else am I gonna talk to?

590
00:45:09,368 --> 00:45:11,040
Certainly not you or Curtin.

591
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:13,596
- Fine partners you two are.
- Got something up your nose?

592
00:45:13,688 --> 00:45:15,041
Blow it out, it'll do you good.

593
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:17,642
Don't think you two
are putting anything over on me.

594
00:45:17,728 --> 00:45:19,684
- Take it easy.
- I know what your game is.

595
00:45:19,768 --> 00:45:20,917
You know more than I do.

596
00:45:21,008 --> 00:45:24,045
Why am I elected to go to the village
instead of you or Curtin?

597
00:45:24,128 --> 00:45:27,518
Don't think I don't see through that.
You two are together against me.

598
00:45:27,608 --> 00:45:28,643
The two days I'd be gone...

599
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:31,447
would give you lots of time
to discover where my goods are.

600
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:32,802
If you fear along those lines...

601
00:45:32,888 --> 00:45:34,526
why don't you take your goods with you?

602
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:37,327
And run the risk of having them
taken from me by bandits?

603
00:45:37,408 --> 00:45:39,558
If you run into them,
you'd be out of luck anyway.

604
00:45:39,648 --> 00:45:41,798
They'd kill you for the shoes on your feet.

605
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:45,120
So that's it. Everything's clear now.

606
00:45:45,448 --> 00:45:47,200
You're hoping bandits will get me.

607
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,717
That would save you a lot of trouble,
wouldn't it?

608
00:45:49,808 --> 00:45:52,368
And your consciences
wouldn't bother you none neither.

609
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:55,164
All right, Dobbs, forget about it.

610
00:46:23,088 --> 00:46:24,567
Just like I thought.

611
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,718
- What's the idea?
- Put your hands up.

612
00:46:28,888 --> 00:46:31,925
I've a good mind to haul off
and pump you up, chest and belly alike.

613
00:46:32,008 --> 00:46:33,964
Would you mind telling me
what this is about?

614
00:46:34,048 --> 00:46:36,039
It won't get you anywhere playing dumb.

615
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:37,277
Well, I'll be.

616
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:41,398
- So that's where your goods are hidden?
- Hey, what's the trouble here?

617
00:46:41,488 --> 00:46:43,956
Seems like I accidentally stumbled
on Dobbsie's treasure.

618
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:47,040
Accidentally? Why were you trying
to pry up that rock?

619
00:46:47,128 --> 00:46:48,925
I saw a gila monster crawl under it.

620
00:46:49,008 --> 00:46:50,361
Brother, I got to hand it to you.

621
00:46:50,448 --> 00:46:53,167
You can certainly pick up a good story
when you need one.

622
00:46:53,888 --> 00:46:57,164
Okay, I'm a liar.
There isn't a gila monster under there.

623
00:46:57,608 --> 00:47:00,168
Let's see you stick your hand in
and get your goods out.

624
00:47:00,248 --> 00:47:02,159
- Go ahead.
- Sure I will.

625
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:04,157
But you try any bad moves...

626
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:06,921
Don't worry. I'll stay right where I am.
I want to see this.

627
00:47:07,008 --> 00:47:08,680
Reach in and get your goods.

628
00:47:08,768 --> 00:47:11,487
If you don't, we'll think you're yellow,
won't we, Howard?

629
00:47:13,048 --> 00:47:16,199
They never let go, do they, Howard,
once they grab onto you?

630
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:21,283
You can cut them in two and the head
will still hang on till sundown, I hear.

631
00:47:21,368 --> 00:47:24,326
By that time the victim
doesn't usually care 'cause he's dead.

632
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,319
- Isn't that right, Howard?
- I reckon.

633
00:47:26,728 --> 00:47:29,606
Why don't you stick your hand in
and get your treasure?

634
00:47:29,688 --> 00:47:31,087
Couldn't be because you're scared...

635
00:47:31,168 --> 00:47:33,284
after the way you've been shooting
your mouth off?

636
00:47:33,368 --> 00:47:34,278
Show us you ain't yellow.

637
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:37,121
I'd hate to think my partner
had a yellow streak up his back.

638
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:39,517
I'll kill you, you dirty, thieving...

639
00:47:41,448 --> 00:47:43,040
Okay, Howard, I got him covered.

640
00:47:43,128 --> 00:47:46,086
Another bad move out of you
and I'll blow you to kingdom come.

641
00:47:46,168 --> 00:47:48,762
Howard, turn that rock over, will you?

642
00:49:35,528 --> 00:49:37,359
The <i>federales</i> are very efficient.

643
00:49:39,368 --> 00:49:41,598
Yeah. <i>Bandidos</i>, eh?

644
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:44,077
Yeah, seems between them
they had a diamond ring...

645
00:49:44,168 --> 00:49:46,477
pearl earrings, a lot of money
and a railway ticket...

646
00:49:46,568 --> 00:49:49,002
with the date of the Aguascalientes
train robbery on it.

647
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:51,397
They've been here several days,
drinking, shooting...

648
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,082
The villagers are afraid
to go out of their huts.

649
00:49:54,168 --> 00:49:55,760
Where are they taking them now?

650
00:49:55,848 --> 00:49:57,361
To the cemetery.

651
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,482
The <i>federales</i>
don't operate in our American way.

652
00:50:11,568 --> 00:50:14,765
They're not fingerprint experts,
but they can follow any trail.

653
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:16,964
Against them, no hideout is any use.

654
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:19,323
They know all the tricks of the bandits.

655
00:50:19,408 --> 00:50:21,876
You can bet your sweet soul
they'll trace down...

656
00:50:21,968 --> 00:50:24,721
every last one of that group
that attacked the train.

657
00:50:24,808 --> 00:50:27,800
It'll take time,
months maybe, but they'll do it.

658
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:34,400
Not many Americans get around this way.

659
00:50:34,488 --> 00:50:36,524
You're the first
I've bumped into in a long time.

660
00:50:36,608 --> 00:50:37,597
That so?

661
00:50:37,688 --> 00:50:40,282
- Mighty rugged country hereabouts.
- Yeah.

662
00:50:41,128 --> 00:50:42,243
My name's Cody.

663
00:50:43,488 --> 00:50:44,557
I'm from Texas.

664
00:50:45,928 --> 00:50:47,805
- What's your game?
- I'm a hunter.

665
00:50:47,888 --> 00:50:49,799
- Professional?
- Yeah.

666
00:50:50,328 --> 00:50:51,522
What all do you hunt?

667
00:50:52,088 --> 00:50:54,556
Tiger cats, anything of commercial value.

668
00:50:55,568 --> 00:50:57,763
How long did you say
you'd been in these mountains?

669
00:50:57,848 --> 00:50:58,883
A few months.

670
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:01,766
Ever seen anything
that looked like pay dirt?

671
00:51:03,168 --> 00:51:06,319
I've a hunch there's loads of the real goods
up in those mountains.

672
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:09,124
No, I know
the whole landscape around here.

673
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:11,642
If there'd been gold,
you can bet I'd have seen it.

674
00:51:11,728 --> 00:51:13,525
There's nothing doing here for gold.

675
00:51:13,608 --> 00:51:15,599
I can look at a hill five miles away...

676
00:51:15,688 --> 00:51:18,043
and tell you if it carries
an ounce or a shipload.

677
00:51:19,088 --> 00:51:20,316
If you haven't found anything...

678
00:51:20,408 --> 00:51:22,080
I'll come with you, put your nose in it.

679
00:51:22,168 --> 00:51:24,523
There's indications in the valley,
lots of indications.

680
00:51:24,608 --> 00:51:26,838
By tracing the rocks,
I find they come from a ridge...

681
00:51:26,928 --> 00:51:28,441
washed down by the tropical rains.

682
00:51:28,528 --> 00:51:30,564
- You don't say so.
- Yes, I say so.

683
00:51:33,088 --> 00:51:34,567
So much for those bandits.

684
00:51:35,848 --> 00:51:38,760
You gotta hand it to the Mexicans
when it comes to swift justice.

685
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:40,964
Once the <i>federales</i> get their mitts
on a criminal...

686
00:51:41,048 --> 00:51:44,165
they know what to do.
They hand him a shovel, tell him to dig.

687
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:45,317
When he's dug deep enough...

688
00:51:45,408 --> 00:51:48,878
they tell him to put the shovel down,
smoke a cigarette and say his prayers.

689
00:51:49,248 --> 00:51:52,638
In another five minutes he's being covered
over with the earth he dug out.

690
00:51:52,808 --> 00:51:55,481
Yeah, you gotta hand it to them all right.

691
00:52:07,048 --> 00:52:10,199
I meant what I said about going along
with you. Those are my burros.

692
00:52:10,288 --> 00:52:13,485
I'm ready to start
if you'll let me go with you to your camp.

693
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:15,957
Thanks anyway,
but I prefer going it by myself.

694
00:52:16,168 --> 00:52:17,362
Good luck.

695
00:52:29,288 --> 00:52:32,803
I went way around, stayed on hard ground
which wouldn't show the tracks.

696
00:52:32,888 --> 00:52:36,358
Every time I hit a high point and looked
I'd see he was still following me.

697
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:39,201
I guess it's only a matter of time
till he shows up here.

698
00:52:39,608 --> 00:52:43,157
- I move we tell him straight off to beat it.
- Now, no, that'd be foolish.

699
00:52:43,248 --> 00:52:46,843
He'd sit for an hour playing the innocent
and then report us to the officials.

700
00:52:46,928 --> 00:52:50,238
Once they come, we can't stay
or take our goods with us if we left.

701
00:52:50,328 --> 00:52:53,047
There's nothing else to do
but kill him the minute he appears.

702
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,561
No crime to visit these mountains.

703
00:52:54,648 --> 00:52:57,720
He may be a guy that likes to wander.
You can't shoot him for that.

704
00:52:57,808 --> 00:52:59,639
If you were to shoot him
it might come out.

705
00:52:59,728 --> 00:53:01,480
We don't have to shoot him necessarily.

706
00:53:01,568 --> 00:53:04,480
We can push him off a rock
and claim it was an accident.

707
00:53:04,568 --> 00:53:06,399
Just who's gonna do the pushing, you?

708
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:07,603
We'll toss for it.

709
00:53:08,168 --> 00:53:10,398
You're sure he was trailing you, are you?

710
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:12,001
- Absolutely.
- How come?

711
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:13,760
Because there he is.

712
00:53:30,368 --> 00:53:32,165
Come over by the fire.

713
00:53:41,808 --> 00:53:44,197
I know quite well,
you fellas, I'm not wanted here.

714
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:45,482
Even after what you told me...

715
00:53:45,568 --> 00:53:48,366
I couldn't resist the desire
to sit and jaw with an American.

716
00:53:48,448 --> 00:53:50,962
Why don't you go where Americans
want to talk to you?

717
00:53:51,048 --> 00:53:52,163
Durango isn't too far off.

718
00:53:52,248 --> 00:53:54,921
They got one
of them American clubs there.

719
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:56,727
I'm not after that.

720
00:53:56,848 --> 00:53:59,726
I've got other things on my mind,
more important.

721
00:54:01,128 --> 00:54:02,925
So do we. Don't make any mistakes.

722
00:54:03,008 --> 00:54:04,760
Our biggest worry is your presence here.

723
00:54:04,848 --> 00:54:05,963
We got no use for you.

724
00:54:06,128 --> 00:54:08,642
We don't even want you
for a cook or a dishwasher.

725
00:54:08,888 --> 00:54:10,401
No vacancies, understand?

726
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:14,439
In case I don't make myself clear,
you'll be doing yourself a favor...

727
00:54:14,528 --> 00:54:16,598
packing up and getting out
tomorrow morning.

728
00:54:16,688 --> 00:54:19,725
Go back where you came from.
Take our blessings with you.

729
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,163
Thanks.

730
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:26,443
Go ahead. Help yourself. We're no misers.
We don't let guys starve to death.

731
00:54:27,688 --> 00:54:29,041
Tonight, you're our guest.

732
00:54:30,288 --> 00:54:31,767
But tomorrow morning...

733
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:34,920
Iook out, no trespassing around here,
you know?

734
00:54:35,088 --> 00:54:36,601
"Beware of the dogs." Get it?

735
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,759
I got myself five foxes and a lion
while you were away at the village.

736
00:54:45,008 --> 00:54:46,919
- How are the hides?
- Pretty good.

737
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:49,722
- Where'd you hit them?
- Right through their eyes.

738
00:54:49,808 --> 00:54:52,880
Excuse me for butting in, but there's
no game here worth going after.

739
00:54:52,968 --> 00:54:54,606
It wouldn't take a week for a hunter...

740
00:54:54,688 --> 00:54:57,327
to clean up all around
for five miles in each direction.

741
00:54:59,408 --> 00:55:01,046
Yes, there's no good hunting here.

742
00:55:01,128 --> 00:55:02,846
That's why we made up our mind
to leave...

743
00:55:02,928 --> 00:55:04,805
so that we could look
for something better.

744
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:07,243
Yes, stranger, you're dead right.
Awful poor ground.

745
00:55:07,328 --> 00:55:08,886
It took us some time to find it out.

746
00:55:08,968 --> 00:55:10,367
Poor ground, you say?

747
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:12,320
Depends on what you're looking for.

748
00:55:12,888 --> 00:55:13,843
For game, yes.

749
00:55:14,368 --> 00:55:16,438
Mighty good ground for something else.

750
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:18,967
What might that be?

751
00:55:19,728 --> 00:55:20,683
Gold.

752
00:55:26,968 --> 00:55:28,117
That's a good one.

753
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:30,563
I told you in the village,
there's no gold around here.

754
00:55:30,648 --> 00:55:33,799
If there was one single ounce of it,
I'd have seen it, believe me.

755
00:55:33,888 --> 00:55:37,597
If you haven't found any gold here,
you're not as smart as you appear to be.

756
00:55:37,688 --> 00:55:39,838
Well, maybe, you're right.

757
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,083
Who knows?

758
00:55:42,648 --> 00:55:45,082
We never thought about gold.
Gives me an idea.

759
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:47,127
Guess I'll sleep on it.

760
00:55:47,768 --> 00:55:49,167
I'll hit the hay.

761
00:55:49,968 --> 00:55:50,923
Yeah. Me, too.

762
00:55:51,568 --> 00:55:53,047
See you in the morning, mister.

763
00:56:08,288 --> 00:56:11,007
I can't figure this bird out.
Is he wise to us or not?

764
00:56:11,088 --> 00:56:13,556
Whether he is or not,
he looks fairly harmless to me.

765
00:56:13,968 --> 00:56:16,687
- Looks can be mighty deceiving.
- No denying that.

766
00:56:19,888 --> 00:56:21,799
I'm keeping my boots on this night.

767
00:56:21,888 --> 00:56:24,197
Might take it in his head
to murder us in our sleep.

768
00:56:24,288 --> 00:56:27,360
- Anything can happen. I'll tell you what.
- Well, then?

769
00:56:27,448 --> 00:56:30,121
You guys go to sleep
and I'll be watchdog for a few hours.

770
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,687
Then you both can take your turns.

771
00:56:31,768 --> 00:56:34,043
- Okay. Got your gun handy?
- Yeah. Right here.

772
00:57:03,448 --> 00:57:04,676
Good morning, friend.

773
00:57:06,848 --> 00:57:08,679
Where'd you get the water
to make coffee?

774
00:57:08,768 --> 00:57:10,918
- I took it out of the <i>olla</i>.
- You did, did you?

775
00:57:11,008 --> 00:57:13,397
We didn't carry that water here
for you to make coffee.

776
00:57:13,488 --> 00:57:16,605
- I didn't know water was so hard to get.
- You know it now.

777
00:57:16,688 --> 00:57:18,167
I'll fill it up for you.

778
00:57:18,288 --> 00:57:19,357
What's up?

779
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,559
I caught this guy stealing our water.

780
00:57:21,848 --> 00:57:24,920
The next time I'll let it out of you
through little round holes.

781
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:28,398
I thought I was among civilized men
who wouldn't begrudge me fresh water.

782
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:30,001
Who's not civilized?

783
00:57:36,928 --> 00:57:38,919
I could easily do the same for you.

784
00:57:39,008 --> 00:57:41,124
It's not settled yet who'd come out on top.

785
00:57:41,728 --> 00:57:42,922
This time I took it.

786
00:57:43,248 --> 00:57:44,647
Thanks for your kind attention.

787
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:47,879
If I was you, stranger,
I'd pack up and go while the going's good.

788
00:57:48,128 --> 00:57:49,481
I mean to stay right here.

789
00:57:49,568 --> 00:57:51,684
The brush and the mountains are free,
aren't they?

790
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,236
Sure. That's right,
whoever's first on the spot.

791
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:56,364
That holds for hunters,
but not for gold miners.

792
00:57:56,448 --> 00:57:58,837
Unless they have happened
to have registered their claim.

793
00:57:58,928 --> 00:58:00,441
Who says we have a claim to register?

794
00:58:00,528 --> 00:58:03,884
Whatever you say or don't say,
tomorrow I start to dig for gold here.

795
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:15,307
I know you guys
can bump me off any minute...

796
00:58:15,392 --> 00:58:17,986
but that's a risk worth running
considering the stakes.

797
00:58:18,072 --> 00:58:19,710
Let's lay all our cards on the table.

798
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:22,226
As I see it, you guys have to do
one of three things:

799
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:25,349
Kill me, run me off
or take me in with you as a partner.

800
00:58:25,432 --> 00:58:27,309
Let's consider the first.

801
00:58:27,392 --> 00:58:30,464
Another guy may come along tomorrow.
Maybe a dozen other guys.

802
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:31,587
If you start killing them...

803
00:58:31,672 --> 00:58:34,106
how far are you prepared to go?
Ask yourselves that.

804
00:58:34,192 --> 00:58:37,389
Also, don't forget,
the one actually to do the bumping off...

805
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,827
would forever be in the power
of the other two.

806
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:42,984
The only safe way would be
for all of you to drag out your cannons...

807
00:58:43,072 --> 00:58:45,381
and bang away at the same instant
like a firing squad.

808
00:58:45,472 --> 00:58:47,940
We wouldn't stop at anything
to protect our interests.

809
00:58:48,032 --> 00:58:49,511
I claim killing me isn't it.

810
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:52,828
But, of course, that's for you to decide.

811
00:58:53,792 --> 00:58:55,111
As for choice number two...

812
00:58:55,192 --> 00:58:57,183
you run me off,
I might very well inform on you.

813
00:58:57,272 --> 00:58:58,990
We'd get you if you did that.

814
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:01,666
We'd get you
if we had to go all the way to China.

815
00:59:01,752 --> 00:59:04,824
25º% of the value
of your find is the reward I'd get.

816
00:59:04,912 --> 00:59:06,709
And that would be mighty tempting.

817
00:59:07,192 --> 00:59:09,626
It's a strong argument
in favor of number one.

818
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,111
I don't deny it.

819
00:59:11,192 --> 00:59:13,023
But let's see
what number three has to offer.

820
00:59:13,352 --> 00:59:16,105
If you take me in as a partner,
you don't stand to lose anything.

821
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,901
I'll not ask a share in what you've made
so far, only in the profits to come.

822
00:59:21,352 --> 00:59:22,751
What do you say?

823
00:59:25,032 --> 00:59:27,865
Mind, stranger, letting us talk this over
among ourselves?

824
00:59:27,952 --> 00:59:29,146
Not at all. Go ahead.

825
00:59:29,352 --> 00:59:31,263
I have to look after my burros anyway.

826
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:47,946
- What do you think?
- Sending him away is out of the question.

827
00:59:48,032 --> 00:59:50,182
Either we bump him off
or make him a partner.

828
00:59:50,272 --> 00:59:52,866
F.C. Dobbs ain't a guy
that likes being taken advantage of.

829
00:59:53,192 --> 00:59:54,545
Do the mug in, I say.

830
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:56,066
He told us how, didn't he?

831
00:59:56,152 --> 00:59:58,347
All of us hold out our cannons
and let him have it.

832
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:00,070
What do we gain by bumping him off?

833
01:00:00,152 --> 01:00:02,507
If he was asking to share in what we made
it'd be different.

834
01:00:02,592 --> 01:00:04,264
I don't mind being taken advantage of...

835
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:06,149
if it isn't money out of my pocket.

836
01:00:06,232 --> 01:00:07,631
And whoever else comes along...

837
01:00:07,712 --> 01:00:10,385
they're to be invited in, too.
Come one, come all?

838
01:00:10,552 --> 01:00:13,112
You got a point there.
No question about that.

839
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,141
But killing...

840
01:00:15,232 --> 01:00:18,463
- What's the matter, ain't you up to it?
- Sure, I'm up to it.

841
01:00:21,272 --> 01:00:22,671
Let the majority decide.

842
01:00:24,512 --> 01:00:25,911
What's your vote, partner?

843
01:00:26,232 --> 01:00:27,460
For or against?

844
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:33,667
For.

845
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:38,548
Let's make it short and sweet for him.

846
01:01:15,512 --> 01:01:17,423
So it's number one, is it?

847
01:01:17,672 --> 01:01:19,742
Better take a look down that hill first.

848
01:01:30,952 --> 01:01:33,546
I can't make out what they are.
They must be soldiers.

849
01:01:33,632 --> 01:01:35,350
So that's your stinking game, is it?

850
01:01:35,432 --> 01:01:38,424
Informing. I knew you were an informer.
I knew it all the time.

851
01:01:38,512 --> 01:01:40,742
You're wrong, brother.
This means all our funerals.

852
01:01:40,832 --> 01:01:41,981
What's that?

853
01:01:42,072 --> 01:01:44,302
If it's what I think it is,
may the Lord be with us.

854
01:01:44,392 --> 01:01:48,021
They're not soldiers, they're bandits.
After guns and ammunition, not gold.

855
01:01:48,112 --> 01:01:50,751
Some villager must have told them
about the American hunter.

856
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:54,029
They don't look like soldiers to me, either.
They are bandits.

857
01:01:54,112 --> 01:01:56,546
We better start thinking
of a way to defend ourselves.

858
01:01:56,632 --> 01:01:59,908
We can hide in the rocks but
we'll lose the burros and the whole outfit.

859
01:01:59,992 --> 01:02:01,664
The best thing is to fight.

860
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:04,027
You have good eyes.
Stay here on this lookout...

861
01:02:04,112 --> 01:02:06,103
for the time being
and watch their movements.

862
01:02:06,192 --> 01:02:08,581
You herd all the burros
in that thicket there.

863
01:02:08,672 --> 01:02:12,187
Dobbs, we'll wrap up all our belongings
and dump them in the trench.

864
01:02:48,672 --> 01:02:50,310
They're turning onto the trail.

865
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:52,428
- How many of them are there?
- About a dozen.

866
01:02:52,512 --> 01:02:55,310
They'll be an hour getting here
so we better eat something.

867
01:02:55,632 --> 01:02:57,145
Come on down, friend.

868
01:03:55,352 --> 01:03:57,741
Look, Howard.
The one in the gold hat, remember?

869
01:03:57,832 --> 01:03:59,743
Yeah, the man in the train robbery.

870
01:03:59,832 --> 01:04:02,027
They think whoever was here is gone.

871
01:04:06,392 --> 01:04:08,826
Some want to go back down
the mountains, others want to stay...

872
01:04:08,912 --> 01:04:11,506
and use this site as headquarters
to raid the villages.

873
01:04:11,592 --> 01:04:12,820
How about pouring it into them?

874
01:04:12,912 --> 01:04:16,268
- Bumping off as many as we can, real fast?
- No, let's hold our horses.

875
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:36,666
We are <i>federales</i>.

876
01:04:37,072 --> 01:04:39,188
You know, the mounted police.

877
01:04:39,552 --> 01:04:41,782
If you are the police,
where are your badges?

878
01:04:41,872 --> 01:04:44,591
Badges? We ain't got no badges.

879
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:47,224
We don't need no badges.

880
01:04:47,312 --> 01:04:49,667
I don't have to show you
any stinking badges.

881
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,743
Better not come any closer.

882
01:04:54,632 --> 01:04:56,588
We didn't try to do you any harm.

883
01:04:56,912 --> 01:04:59,107
Why don't you try to be
a little more polite?

884
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:02,190
Give us your gun
and we'll leave you in peace.

885
01:05:02,672 --> 01:05:04,424
I need my gun myself.

886
01:05:05,992 --> 01:05:08,028
Throw that old iron over here.

887
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:10,307
We'll pick it up and go on our way.

888
01:05:10,392 --> 01:05:13,190
You go anyway without my gun,
and go quick.

889
01:05:15,592 --> 01:05:17,822
All right.

890
01:05:40,392 --> 01:05:43,429
Look here, <i>amigo</i>, you got the wrong idea.

891
01:05:43,952 --> 01:05:47,069
We don't want to get your gun
for nothing. We want to buy it.

892
01:05:48,232 --> 01:05:51,463
Look, I have a gold watch
with a gold chain...

893
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:53,431
made in your own country.

894
01:05:53,672 --> 01:05:57,665
The watch and the chain,
they're worth at least 200 pesos.

895
01:05:58,272 --> 01:05:59,864
I'll change it for your gun.

896
01:06:00,912 --> 01:06:03,585
You better take it.
That's a good business for you.

897
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:05,703
You keep your watch, I'll keep my gun.

898
01:06:06,152 --> 01:06:09,781
Oh, you'll keep it? You will keep it?
We won't get it?

899
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,021
I'll show you.

900
01:07:29,392 --> 01:07:30,825
Anybody get hurt?

901
01:07:32,272 --> 01:07:33,830
Looks like we won that round.

902
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:38,346
- That guy with the gold hat, ain't he...
- We spotted him, too. The train robber.

903
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:40,821
- Maybe they got enough?
- I doubt it.

904
01:07:40,912 --> 01:07:44,143
Since they know there's four guns,
they'll be more determined than ever.

905
01:07:44,232 --> 01:07:48,145
- What do you suppose they'll pull next?
- No telling. All we can do is sit tight.

906
01:07:49,272 --> 01:07:51,945
Cody, are you all right?

907
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:41,107
He's dead.

908
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:44,703
Got it right through the neck.

909
01:08:45,992 --> 01:08:47,107
One less gun.

910
01:08:51,912 --> 01:08:54,062
Chopping wood for camp, that's funny.

911
01:08:55,032 --> 01:08:57,387
If they're up to what I think they are,
it ain't funny.

912
01:08:57,472 --> 01:08:59,588
- What's that?
- They're building moving barricades.

913
01:08:59,672 --> 01:09:00,787
An old Indian trick.

914
01:09:00,872 --> 01:09:03,864
They crawl and push the barricades.
You can't see where to shoot.

915
01:09:03,952 --> 01:09:08,150
I'd be willing to trade my share of the
mine right now for a few hand grenades.

916
01:09:08,272 --> 01:09:10,183
You'd better get to your posts.

917
01:09:32,592 --> 01:09:34,423
They're beating it.

918
01:09:41,672 --> 01:09:44,425
- What do you make of that?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

919
01:09:45,232 --> 01:09:47,507
Wait a minute,
this may be some trick to lure us out.

920
01:09:47,592 --> 01:09:50,982
I don't think so. They ain't
good enough actors for this kind of a trick.

921
01:10:07,312 --> 01:10:09,542
Hey, partner. Up here.

922
01:10:09,712 --> 01:10:12,101
Here's a sight if there ever was one.

923
01:10:23,072 --> 01:10:26,382
<i>Federales.</i> Look at them.
I could kiss every one of them.

924
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:29,862
They must've gotten it from the villagers
there were bandits headed here.

925
01:10:29,952 --> 01:10:31,829
Why don't they wait here,
make a fight of it?

926
01:10:31,912 --> 01:10:33,391
They know all the tricks, that's why.

927
01:10:33,472 --> 01:10:36,703
With us behind and the <i>federales</i> facing
them, they wouldn't have a chance.

928
01:10:36,792 --> 01:10:38,384
Go get them, sic 'em time.

929
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:41,384
Chew them up and don't spit them out.
Swallow them.

930
01:10:41,472 --> 01:10:42,382
Am I happy.

931
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:45,111
Tell you the truth,
I was already eating dirt.

932
01:10:46,712 --> 01:10:48,384
I wonder who he is.

933
01:10:50,632 --> 01:10:52,270
And if he's got any folks.

934
01:10:52,352 --> 01:10:53,546
Supposing he has?

935
01:10:53,632 --> 01:10:55,623
Let's take a look at his belongings.

936
01:11:16,392 --> 01:11:17,711
A few hundred pesos.

937
01:11:18,912 --> 01:11:21,710
Name's James Cody. Dallas, Texas.

938
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,706
A letter from Dallas, too.
It must be his home.

939
01:11:26,472 --> 01:11:28,030
Reckon she's his girl.

940
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:31,226
Not bad.

941
01:11:32,992 --> 01:11:35,665
"Dear Jim: Your letter just arrived.

942
01:11:35,952 --> 01:11:39,786
"It was such a relief to get word
after so many months of...

943
01:11:41,192 --> 01:11:42,147
"silence.

944
01:11:43,152 --> 01:11:45,746
"I realize, of course, that...

945
01:11:46,072 --> 01:11:50,668
"there aren't any mailboxes
that you can drop a letter in...

946
01:11:51,512 --> 01:11:53,867
"out there in the wild."

947
01:11:54,312 --> 01:11:55,665
You better read it.

948
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,065
"But that doesn't keep me
from worrying about you.

949
01:12:00,392 --> 01:12:04,749
"Little Jimmy is fine, but he misses
his daddy almost as much as I do.

950
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:07,586
"He keeps asking,
'When's Daddy coming home? '

951
01:12:08,432 --> 01:12:11,230
"You say if you do not make
a real find this time...

952
01:12:11,312 --> 01:12:12,791
"you'll never go again.

953
01:12:13,272 --> 01:12:16,389
"I cannot begin to tell you
how my heart rejoices...

954
01:12:16,952 --> 01:12:19,182
"at those words, if you really mean them.

955
01:12:19,872 --> 01:12:22,227
"Now I feel free to tell you...

956
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:25,066
"I've never thought
any material treasure...

957
01:12:25,592 --> 01:12:29,790
"no matter how great, is worth the pain
of these long separations.

958
01:12:31,632 --> 01:12:34,544
"The country is especially lovely this year.

959
01:12:35,152 --> 01:12:38,349
"It's been a perfect spring.
Warm rains and hardly any frost.

960
01:12:38,952 --> 01:12:41,068
"The fruit trees are all in bloom.

961
01:12:41,712 --> 01:12:43,828
"The upper orchard looks aflame...

962
01:12:44,032 --> 01:12:46,546
"and the lower, like after a snowstorm.

963
01:12:47,312 --> 01:12:49,268
"Everybody looks forward to big crops.

964
01:12:49,952 --> 01:12:52,022
"I do hope you are back for the harvest.

965
01:12:55,992 --> 01:12:59,428
"Of course, I'm hoping
that you will at last strike it rich.

966
01:12:59,872 --> 01:13:01,385
"It is high time for luck...

967
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,549
"to start smiling upon you.

968
01:13:04,112 --> 01:13:05,864
"But just in case she doesn't...

969
01:13:06,272 --> 01:13:09,150
"remember we've already found
life's real treasure.

970
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,822
"Forever yours, Helen."

971
01:13:16,352 --> 01:13:18,547
I guess we better dig a hole for him.

972
01:13:29,192 --> 01:13:31,581
Yeah, not so good.
Not so good as yesterday.

973
01:13:31,672 --> 01:13:33,947
Want my opinion?
It'll be a lot less from now on.

974
01:13:34,032 --> 01:13:35,784
We've taken
all the gold this mountain has.

975
01:13:35,872 --> 01:13:37,510
How much do you figure we got to date?

976
01:13:37,592 --> 01:13:40,504
Not as much as we were aiming to collect.
Not $40,000.

977
01:13:40,592 --> 01:13:42,230
I'm willing to lower my hindsight.

978
01:13:42,312 --> 01:13:45,987
We've got upwards of $35,000 apiece.
I tell you, we ought to be plenty thankful.

979
01:13:46,072 --> 01:13:47,790
Let's call it quits and pack up and leave.

980
01:13:47,872 --> 01:13:49,828
The sooner the better
as far as I'm concerned.

981
01:13:49,912 --> 01:13:51,630
I don't want to keep that dame waiting.

982
01:13:51,712 --> 01:13:54,704
It'll take a week to break the mine,
put the mountain back in shape.

983
01:13:54,792 --> 01:13:55,747
Do what to the mountain?

984
01:13:55,832 --> 01:13:57,743
Make her look like
she was before we came.

985
01:13:57,832 --> 01:13:58,867
I don't get it.

986
01:13:58,952 --> 01:14:01,386
We wounded this place.
It's our duty to close her wounds.

987
01:14:01,472 --> 01:14:04,908
The least we can do to show our gratitude
for all the wealth she's given us.

988
01:14:04,992 --> 01:14:07,426
If you guys don't want to help me,
I'll do it alone.

989
01:14:07,992 --> 01:14:10,586
You talk about that mountain
like it was a real woman.

990
01:14:11,352 --> 01:14:14,071
She's been a lot better to me
than any woman I ever knew.

991
01:14:14,152 --> 01:14:16,905
Keep your shirt on, old-timer.
Sure, I'll help you.

992
01:14:54,392 --> 01:14:56,030
I reckon that's about everything.

993
01:14:56,112 --> 01:14:59,104
Each man's burros with his goods
will be his own responsibility.

994
01:14:59,192 --> 01:15:00,147
Come on.

995
01:15:01,912 --> 01:15:03,664
Goodbye, mountain, and thanks.

996
01:15:05,552 --> 01:15:07,941
Yeah, thanks, mountain.

997
01:15:32,912 --> 01:15:34,550
I've been thinking about her.

998
01:15:35,192 --> 01:15:37,023
Cody's widow, I mean, and the kid.

999
01:15:37,752 --> 01:15:38,707
You know what?

1000
01:15:38,832 --> 01:15:42,507
We ought to give them a fourth just
as if he'd been our partner from the start.

1001
01:15:42,592 --> 01:15:44,310
What? A fourth of all our goods?

1002
01:15:44,592 --> 01:15:46,583
- That's right.
- Are you crazy?

1003
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:49,744
If not for him, we wouldn't have
walked away from that mountain.

1004
01:15:49,832 --> 01:15:50,742
Ask Howard.

1005
01:15:50,952 --> 01:15:53,102
The buzzard would have gotten fat
on us all right.

1006
01:15:53,192 --> 01:15:55,660
Yeah, it might just as well have been
one of us.

1007
01:15:55,752 --> 01:15:58,061
But it wasn't.
It's our good luck and his bad.

1008
01:15:58,752 --> 01:16:01,061
Whatever you guys do,
I'm going to give a fourth.

1009
01:16:01,152 --> 01:16:04,542
I got more than I need, anyhow.
Half what I got is enough to last me out.

1010
01:16:04,632 --> 01:16:05,985
Fourth? Sure.

1011
01:16:06,072 --> 01:16:09,030
You two guys must have been born
in a revival meeting.

1012
01:16:18,072 --> 01:16:19,471
We got company.

1013
01:16:23,352 --> 01:16:24,671
Steady, boys.

1014
01:16:56,032 --> 01:16:57,101
Coffee.

1015
01:17:02,032 --> 01:17:03,351
Give him some tobacco.

1016
01:17:17,752 --> 01:17:20,789
We give them our tobacco,
they give us theirs, I don't get it.

1017
01:17:20,872 --> 01:17:22,942
Why not everybody smoke his own?

1018
01:17:23,512 --> 01:17:25,264
Take some and thank them.

1019
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:32,384
They're after something.

1020
01:17:33,192 --> 01:17:35,308
Takes them a while to come to the point.

1021
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:39,181
To say what you want right off the bat
isn't considered polite among Indians.

1022
01:18:08,632 --> 01:18:10,588
They got nothing but time?

1023
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:43,351
His boy fell in the water,
they fished him out.

1024
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:46,071
- He ain't dead, but he just won't come to.
- Tough.

1025
01:18:47,432 --> 01:18:49,070
I'll go have a look at the boy.

1026
01:18:49,152 --> 01:18:52,064
I'll be back in a little while.
Before morning, probably.

1027
01:19:00,272 --> 01:19:02,388
Look after my goods while I am gone.

1028
01:19:46,152 --> 01:19:47,107
Tequila.

1029
01:22:11,352 --> 01:22:14,344
Artificial respiration did it
and a few Boy Scout tricks.

1030
01:22:14,432 --> 01:22:16,502
I think it was more shock than drowning.

1031
01:22:16,592 --> 01:22:20,028
He hadn't swallowed much water.
Maybe he was stunned while diving.

1032
01:22:20,152 --> 01:22:23,349
How did these Indians know we were
in this neck of the woods anyhow?

1033
01:22:23,432 --> 01:22:27,345
When you're near their villages,
don't ask me how, they just know.

1034
01:22:55,832 --> 01:22:56,947
What's up?

1035
01:22:57,032 --> 01:22:59,626
He's insisting we return to his village
and be his guests.

1036
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,385
Tell him to forget it.
Tell him he don't owe us a thing.

1037
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:15,791
If he doesn't pay off his debt
all the saints will be angry.

1038
01:23:15,872 --> 01:23:17,305
This is no laughing matter.

1039
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:20,987
I'm afraid he's determined
to take us with him, even if it means force.

1040
01:23:21,072 --> 01:23:22,471
I'll handle this.

1041
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:31,342
Wait a minute. You can't fight your way
out of this. Put your guns away.

1042
01:23:31,432 --> 01:23:35,141
Have every Indian in the mountain on
our trail. We'd be scalped in half an hour.

1043
01:23:44,032 --> 01:23:45,465
What'd he say then?

1044
01:23:45,592 --> 01:23:48,629
It didn't make any difference
about you guys but I have to come.

1045
01:23:48,712 --> 01:23:50,942
- It's like that, he just wants you.
- Looks like it.

1046
01:23:51,032 --> 01:23:52,431
Why don't you go with them?

1047
01:23:52,512 --> 01:23:55,470
Stay a few days and we'll meet you
in Durango. We'll wait there.

1048
01:23:55,552 --> 01:23:57,986
- What about my goods?
- Why don't you take them with you.

1049
01:23:58,072 --> 01:24:01,747
If they found out they might forget he was
their honored guest and bump him off.

1050
01:24:01,832 --> 01:24:03,709
What'll I do? Dump them on the ground?

1051
01:24:03,792 --> 01:24:07,421
We'll take them with us if you want us to
and wait for you in Durango.

1052
01:24:09,192 --> 01:24:11,308
I reckon that's about the only solution.

1053
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:15,021
I bet you'll remember this
the next time you try to do a good deed.

1054
01:24:15,472 --> 01:24:18,384
Maybe after I've stayed with them
they'll give me a horse.

1055
01:24:18,472 --> 01:24:20,303
Then I'll be a day or two behind you.

1056
01:24:20,392 --> 01:24:22,303
That'll be swell. Good luck, Howard.

1057
01:24:22,392 --> 01:24:24,667
Yeah, all the luck in the world.

1058
01:24:24,872 --> 01:24:28,706
We'll be lonesome without you. But
my Sunday school teacher used to say:

1059
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:32,469
"You got to learn to swallow
disappointments in this sad life."

1060
01:24:32,552 --> 01:24:33,746
Hurry up and join us.

1061
01:24:33,832 --> 01:24:36,790
Look out for those Indian dames.
They tell me they're smart.

1062
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:38,942
One of them squaws might marry you.

1063
01:24:39,472 --> 01:24:42,748
Maybe I'll do just that. Pick out
a good-looking squaw and marry her.

1064
01:24:42,832 --> 01:24:46,142
They're easy to dress, feed and entertain.
They don't nag at you, either.

1065
01:24:46,232 --> 01:24:47,665
So long, partners.

1066
01:24:49,592 --> 01:24:51,184
See you in Durango.

1067
01:25:48,072 --> 01:25:50,586
Ain't it always his burros
that won't march in line...

1068
01:25:50,672 --> 01:25:54,381
stray off the trail and smash their packs
against the trees and rocks?

1069
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:59,105
I wish they'd stray off far enough
to fall down about 2,000 feet of gorge.

1070
01:25:59,632 --> 01:26:01,827
Why'd you offer
to carry his goods for him?

1071
01:26:01,912 --> 01:26:03,709
As if he couldn't manage by himself.

1072
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:06,260
He knew what he was doing
when he turned them over to us.

1073
01:26:06,352 --> 01:26:08,183
Mighty cute of him, wasn't it?

1074
01:26:08,952 --> 01:26:12,149
What's the use of railing against
the old man? It won't do any good.

1075
01:26:12,232 --> 01:26:14,985
Save your breath
for the next piece of trail.

1076
01:26:15,192 --> 01:26:17,262
I'm stopping here for the night.

1077
01:26:17,432 --> 01:26:20,583
If you want to go on it's okay with me,
but take his burros with you.

1078
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,151
They ain't my responsibility.

1079
01:26:22,232 --> 01:26:24,700
It's early. We can make four,
five miles more before dark.

1080
01:26:24,792 --> 01:26:28,580
Nobody ordered you to stay here.
You can go 20 miles more for all I care.

1081
01:26:29,712 --> 01:26:30,986
Ordered me?

1082
01:26:32,232 --> 01:26:33,221
You?

1083
01:26:34,792 --> 01:26:36,862
Who's ordering who to do anything?

1084
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,746
You talk like you're boss of this outfit.

1085
01:26:41,872 --> 01:26:44,306
Maybe you are, let's hear you say it.

1086
01:26:46,992 --> 01:26:48,983
All right, if you can't go any further.

1087
01:26:49,072 --> 01:26:50,824
Who says I can't? Don't make me laugh.

1088
01:26:50,912 --> 01:26:53,062
I can go four times
as far as a mug like you.

1089
01:26:53,152 --> 01:26:56,588
But I don't want to. I could if I want to,
but I don't want to, see, mug?

1090
01:26:59,792 --> 01:27:01,544
What's the use of hollering?

1091
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:04,829
We're started on something
and we've got to finish it, like it or not.

1092
01:27:04,912 --> 01:27:06,425
We'll camp here.

1093
01:27:13,432 --> 01:27:15,468
Wonder what the old man's doing now.

1094
01:27:15,552 --> 01:27:19,227
Eating a meal of roast turkey
and drinking a bottle of tequila probably.

1095
01:27:19,312 --> 01:27:21,872
This is the first day we've had
to manage without his help.

1096
01:27:21,952 --> 01:27:24,227
Once we get the hang of it, it'll be easier.

1097
01:27:24,312 --> 01:27:26,507
How far away
do you suppose the railroad is?

1098
01:27:26,592 --> 01:27:29,231
- Not so far as the crow flies.
- We ain't crows.

1099
01:27:30,352 --> 01:27:33,025
I figure we can reach the high-pass
in two days more...

1100
01:27:33,112 --> 01:27:35,467
then it'll be three or four days
to the railroad.

1101
01:27:35,552 --> 01:27:38,385
That's figuring no hard luck
on the trail, of course.

1102
01:27:42,032 --> 01:27:43,670
What's the joke, Dobbsie?

1103
01:27:45,392 --> 01:27:47,189
Aren't you going to let me in on it?

1104
01:27:47,272 --> 01:27:49,627
In on it? Sure I will.

1105
01:27:50,192 --> 01:27:51,261
Sure.

1106
01:27:53,392 --> 01:27:55,747
Go ahead, spill it. What's so funny?

1107
01:27:55,872 --> 01:27:58,705
I was thinking what a bonehead play
that old jackass made...

1108
01:27:58,792 --> 01:28:02,182
- when he put all his goods in our keeping.
- What do you mean?

1109
01:28:02,272 --> 01:28:05,025
Figured he'd let us do his sweating
for him, did he?

1110
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:07,786
- We'll show him.
- What are you getting at?

1111
01:28:08,872 --> 01:28:10,749
Can't you see? It's all ours.

1112
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:13,790
We don't go back to Durango at all.
Not at all.

1113
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,786
I don't follow you.

1114
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:18,340
Don't be such a sap.
Where did you ever grow up?

1115
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,900
All right, to make it clear
to a dumbhead like you...

1116
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:24,462
we take all his goods and go straight
up north and leave the jackass flat.

1117
01:28:24,552 --> 01:28:27,783
You aren't serious, are you? You don't
really mean what you are saying.

1118
01:28:27,872 --> 01:28:30,705
Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing
he don't mean.

1119
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:37,704
As long as I'm here and can do anything,
you won't touch the old man's goods.

1120
01:28:37,872 --> 01:28:39,703
I know exactly what you mean.

1121
01:28:39,912 --> 01:28:42,267
You want to take it all for yourself
and cut me out.

1122
01:28:42,352 --> 01:28:46,425
No, I'm on the level with the old man,
like I'd be with you if you weren't here.

1123
01:28:46,512 --> 01:28:49,788
Get off your soapbox. You only sound
foolish out here in this wilderness.

1124
01:28:49,872 --> 01:28:51,430
I know you for what you are.

1125
01:28:51,512 --> 01:28:55,187
For a long time I've had my suspicions
about you and now I know I've been right.

1126
01:28:55,272 --> 01:28:58,548
- What suspicions?
- You're not putting anything over on me.

1127
01:28:58,632 --> 01:29:00,065
I see right through you.

1128
01:29:00,152 --> 01:29:03,462
For a long time you've wanted
to bump me off at the first opportunity...

1129
01:29:03,552 --> 01:29:05,588
and bury me out here
in the bush like a dog...

1130
01:29:05,672 --> 01:29:09,381
so you could take not only the old man's
goods but mine in the bargain.

1131
01:29:09,832 --> 01:29:12,585
When you get to Durango safely
you'll have a big laugh...

1132
01:29:12,672 --> 01:29:14,947
thinking how dumb
the old man and I were.

1133
01:29:16,392 --> 01:29:19,509
You make another move towards me
and I'll pull the trigger.

1134
01:29:20,432 --> 01:29:22,900
Now, get your hands up.
Come on, get them up.

1135
01:29:26,472 --> 01:29:28,224
Was I right, or was I?

1136
01:29:28,592 --> 01:29:31,948
You and your Sunday school talk
about protecting people's goods.

1137
01:29:32,272 --> 01:29:35,184
You. Go on, stand up,
and take it like a man.

1138
01:29:35,712 --> 01:29:37,031
Come on, get up.

1139
01:29:40,312 --> 01:29:41,506
Let go of it.

1140
01:29:44,632 --> 01:29:46,941
- The cards are dealt the other way now.
- Yeah.

1141
01:29:47,032 --> 01:29:48,545
Now listen to me...

1142
01:29:48,992 --> 01:29:50,664
Look, you're all wrong.

1143
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:53,903
Not for a moment did I ever intend
to rob you or do you any harm.

1144
01:29:53,992 --> 01:29:55,425
Just like I said...

1145
01:29:55,512 --> 01:29:58,822
I'd fight for you and yours
like I'd fight for the old man's.

1146
01:29:58,912 --> 01:30:01,267
If you really mean that
give me back my gun.

1147
01:30:08,912 --> 01:30:10,391
My pal.

1148
01:30:12,552 --> 01:30:16,670
Wouldn't it be better the way things are
to separate tomorrow or even tonight?

1149
01:30:16,752 --> 01:30:19,630
- That would suit you fine, wouldn't it?
- Why me more than you?

1150
01:30:19,712 --> 01:30:23,148
So you could fall on me from behind,
sneak up and shoot me in the back.

1151
01:30:23,232 --> 01:30:24,585
All right, I'll go first.

1152
01:30:24,672 --> 01:30:26,549
And wait for me on the trail
to ambush me?

1153
01:30:26,632 --> 01:30:28,748
Why wouldn't I do it now
if I meant to kill you?

1154
01:30:28,832 --> 01:30:31,141
I'll tell you why, because you're yellow.

1155
01:30:31,312 --> 01:30:35,100
You don't have the nerve to pull the
trigger while I'm looking you in the eye.

1156
01:30:35,192 --> 01:30:39,105
If you think like that, there's nothing
to do but to tie you up every night.

1157
01:30:43,912 --> 01:30:46,142
I'll tell you what. I'll make you a little bet.

1158
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:48,826
Three times 35 is 105.

1159
01:30:49,032 --> 01:30:52,104
I'll bet $105,000
you go to sleep before I do.

1160
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:32,582
Get up there at the head of the train.

1161
01:32:30,552 --> 01:32:31,701
Get up!

1162
01:32:33,592 --> 01:32:37,346
The cards are dealt the other way now,
and for the last time. No more shuffling.

1163
01:32:37,432 --> 01:32:39,787
- What cards are...
- I'm going to finish this right now.

1164
01:32:39,872 --> 01:32:42,261
I won't take orders from you
like I had to do today.

1165
01:32:42,352 --> 01:32:45,822
- You mean you're going to murder me?
- No, brother, not murder. Your mistake.

1166
01:32:45,912 --> 01:32:49,541
I'm doing it to save my life that you'd take
from me when I wasn't looking at you.

1167
01:32:49,632 --> 01:32:52,146
- The old man'll catch up with you.
- He will, will he?

1168
01:32:52,232 --> 01:32:54,951
I got an answer for that one, too.
Know what I'll tell him?

1169
01:32:55,032 --> 01:32:58,820
I'll tell him you tied me to a tree and
made your getaway taking all our goods.

1170
01:32:58,912 --> 01:33:00,789
He'll be looking for you and not me.

1171
01:33:00,872 --> 01:33:04,706
Up. March. Today I had to march
to your music, now you march to mine.

1172
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:06,384
- Where?
- To your funeral.

1173
01:33:07,592 --> 01:33:09,184
Come on, keep going.

1174
01:33:09,952 --> 01:33:11,988
Get up. Sleepy?

1175
01:33:12,752 --> 01:33:15,471
You'll be asleep soon enough.
Sound asleep.

1176
01:33:52,992 --> 01:33:54,630
Maybe I didn't kill him.

1177
01:33:55,152 --> 01:33:58,144
Maybe he just staggered and fell down
without being hit.

1178
01:34:33,232 --> 01:34:35,143
You keep it, it's yours anyhow.

1179
01:34:50,512 --> 01:34:53,106
No, they won't find him.

1180
01:34:54,632 --> 01:34:57,510
I'll dig a hole for him
first thing in the morning.

1181
01:35:04,232 --> 01:35:05,506
This fire...

1182
01:35:06,272 --> 01:35:07,751
don't give much heat.

1183
01:35:13,272 --> 01:35:14,591
Conscience.

1184
01:35:15,952 --> 01:35:17,180
What a thing.

1185
01:35:19,272 --> 01:35:22,469
If you believe you've got a conscience,
it'll pester you to death.

1186
01:35:22,552 --> 01:35:25,225
But if you don't believe you've got one...

1187
01:35:25,392 --> 01:35:27,110
what can it do to you?

1188
01:35:27,832 --> 01:35:31,745
Makes me sick all this talking and fussing
about nonsense.

1189
01:36:45,512 --> 01:36:47,707
Maybe I'd better leave him like he is.

1190
01:36:48,392 --> 01:36:50,826
Ain't very likely anybody will find him.

1191
01:36:51,432 --> 01:36:55,220
In a week, the buzzards and the ants
will have done away with him anyway.

1192
01:36:58,632 --> 01:37:02,671
I don't know what's getting into me.
Was that really a tiger?

1193
01:37:10,632 --> 01:37:11,587
No.

1194
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:16,987
What if his eyes are open, looking at me?

1195
01:37:18,712 --> 01:37:21,624
Best thing to do
is to get to the railroad in a hurry.

1196
01:37:43,432 --> 01:37:44,706
Burro.

1197
01:37:47,072 --> 01:37:49,142
It's better not to have buried him.

1198
01:37:49,352 --> 01:37:51,229
I did right, yeah.

1199
01:37:53,392 --> 01:37:56,782
What I should have done, maybe,
was bury his clothes...

1200
01:37:57,152 --> 01:37:59,541
and leave him to the ants
and the buzzards.

1201
01:37:59,872 --> 01:38:01,100
Buzzards!

1202
01:38:01,752 --> 01:38:04,983
If somebody saw them circling,
they'd know something was dead.

1203
01:38:06,112 --> 01:38:08,182
Buzzards ain't spotted him yet.

1204
01:38:09,192 --> 01:38:10,591
Lucky for me.

1205
01:38:38,352 --> 01:38:39,467
Curtin!

1206
01:38:48,512 --> 01:38:49,786
Where are you?

1207
01:39:01,312 --> 01:39:04,588
I better get a hold of myself.
I mustn't lose my head.

1208
01:39:06,672 --> 01:39:09,061
There's one thing certain, he ain't here.

1209
01:39:10,232 --> 01:39:12,427
I got it. The tiger.

1210
01:39:13,472 --> 01:39:17,750
Yeah, that's it. The tiger must have
dragged him off to his lair, that's what.

1211
01:39:18,592 --> 01:39:22,471
Yeah, pretty soon, not even the bones
will be left to tell the story.

1212
01:39:28,432 --> 01:39:30,229
Done as if by order.

1213
01:41:07,392 --> 01:41:09,542
I came to in the middle of the night.

1214
01:41:10,352 --> 01:41:12,582
My gun was on the ground beside me.

1215
01:41:13,792 --> 01:41:17,148
He must have left it there
to make it look like suicide.

1216
01:41:18,432 --> 01:41:22,107
I figured he'd come back in the morning
to see if I still had a flicker of life.

1217
01:41:22,192 --> 01:41:24,660
I thought about waiting for him
and letting him have it...

1218
01:41:24,752 --> 01:41:27,550
but there was a good chance
in my condition I might miss...

1219
01:41:27,632 --> 01:41:29,941
so I decided to crawl away
like a poisoned dog.

1220
01:41:30,032 --> 01:41:33,502
- Take it easy, you're talking too much.
- Don't you worry about me.

1221
01:41:33,592 --> 01:41:36,060
I'll pull out of this if only to get that guy.

1222
01:41:36,152 --> 01:41:40,031
It appears our fine Mr. Dobbs has made off
with our goods and is on his way north.

1223
01:41:40,112 --> 01:41:43,024
- Yeah.
- I reckon we can't blame him too much.

1224
01:41:43,112 --> 01:41:44,306
What do you mean?

1225
01:41:44,392 --> 01:41:46,701
I mean, he's not a real killer, as killers go.

1226
01:41:46,792 --> 01:41:49,465
I think he's as honest
as the next fella, or almost.

1227
01:41:49,552 --> 01:41:52,510
The mistake was leaving you two
in the depths of the wilderness...

1228
01:41:52,592 --> 01:41:54,423
with more than $100,000 between you.

1229
01:41:54,512 --> 01:41:56,707
That's a big temptation, partner,
believe me.

1230
01:41:56,792 --> 01:41:58,271
He shot me down in cold blood.

1231
01:41:58,352 --> 01:42:01,469
After I was down he shot me
a second time just to make sure.

1232
01:42:01,552 --> 01:42:04,828
If I was young and out there with one
of you, I'd have been tempted, too.

1233
01:42:04,912 --> 01:42:07,870
Maybe I wouldn't have fallen,
but I reckon I would've been tempted.

1234
01:42:07,952 --> 01:42:10,512
There now. You're almost as good as new.

1235
01:42:11,552 --> 01:42:13,941
Now, to find that thief
and get our goods back.

1236
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:26,224
They're not only giving me a horse
but coming to protect me.

1237
01:42:26,312 --> 01:42:27,870
- You ain't going.
- Who says so?

1238
01:42:27,952 --> 01:42:30,068
You wouldn't be up to the hard riding.

1239
01:42:30,152 --> 01:42:32,382
- You aren't leaving me behind.
- Look at you.

1240
01:42:32,472 --> 01:42:35,828
You're weak as a kitten.
Don't worry, I'll look after our interests.

1241
01:42:35,912 --> 01:42:37,027
I'm going.

1242
01:42:37,272 --> 01:42:39,547
Well, I reckon you're going.

1243
01:43:09,752 --> 01:43:10,901
Burro!

1244
01:44:53,712 --> 01:44:55,464
Have you got any cigarettes?

1245
01:44:58,712 --> 01:45:01,465
No, I haven't. I've got a little tobacco...

1246
01:45:02,712 --> 01:45:04,145
if that'll do.

1247
01:45:04,792 --> 01:45:07,511
No paper to roll it in?

1248
01:45:08,192 --> 01:45:09,341
Papers?

1249
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,591
Here you are.

1250
01:45:15,832 --> 01:45:18,266
- Going to Durango?
- Yeah.

1251
01:45:19,392 --> 01:45:21,030
That's where I'm headed.

1252
01:45:21,432 --> 01:45:23,343
I've got to sell my burros.

1253
01:45:24,112 --> 01:45:26,672
I got to get some money.
I haven't got a red cent.

1254
01:45:26,752 --> 01:45:27,901
Matches?

1255
01:45:32,112 --> 01:45:34,672
Money? We need money, too.

1256
01:45:35,632 --> 01:45:38,226
Yeah? I could use a good mule driver...

1257
01:45:39,112 --> 01:45:40,670
maybe two or three.

1258
01:45:48,192 --> 01:45:50,069
How much is the pay?

1259
01:45:51,072 --> 01:45:52,300
Two pesos.

1260
01:45:52,792 --> 01:45:55,101
Of course, I can't pay you in advance...

1261
01:45:55,192 --> 01:45:58,229
I got to wait till I get to town
so I can get the money.

1262
01:45:59,992 --> 01:46:01,903
Do I know you from someplace?

1263
01:46:02,752 --> 01:46:04,310
Maybe I know you.

1264
01:46:05,232 --> 01:46:07,348
No, I don't think so.

1265
01:46:09,752 --> 01:46:11,822
- Are you alone?
- No.

1266
01:46:13,272 --> 01:46:14,671
I'm not alone.

1267
01:46:15,992 --> 01:46:18,790
I got a couple of friends
coming along on horseback.

1268
01:46:19,552 --> 01:46:21,986
Yeah, they ought to be here any minute.

1269
01:46:33,032 --> 01:46:34,431
That's funny.

1270
01:46:34,712 --> 01:46:38,227
A man all by himself in bandit country
with a string of burros...

1271
01:46:38,432 --> 01:46:41,105
and his friends behind him on horseback.

1272
01:46:48,312 --> 01:46:50,382
Your friends must be very far behind you.

1273
01:46:50,472 --> 01:46:53,111
Pablo cannot see any dust
even from their horses.

1274
01:46:53,472 --> 01:46:55,030
They'll be along any minute, I tell you.

1275
01:46:59,632 --> 01:47:02,704
I know who you are.
You're the guy in the hole.

1276
01:47:03,032 --> 01:47:05,102
The one who wouldn't give us the rifle.

1277
01:47:05,752 --> 01:47:07,822
I never laid eyes on you until now.

1278
01:47:08,792 --> 01:47:10,703
What you got in the bags?

1279
01:47:16,632 --> 01:47:19,544
- Seems to me like hides.
- Yeah.

1280
01:47:21,232 --> 01:47:22,984
That's what they are, hides.

1281
01:47:23,312 --> 01:47:25,507
Ought to bring in quite a lot of money.

1282
01:47:26,752 --> 01:47:27,821
Yeah.

1283
01:47:29,832 --> 01:47:33,461
Sure you don't want to come along
with me and help me with the burros?

1284
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:40,620
Burro.

1285
01:47:51,032 --> 01:47:52,590
Get away from my burro.

1286
01:47:53,032 --> 01:47:57,230
We can sell those burros
for just as good a price as you'd get.

1287
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,825
Get away from my burro.

1288
01:47:58,912 --> 01:48:03,463
You can't frighten even a sick louse
with that. You can only shoot one of us...

1289
01:48:03,952 --> 01:48:07,740
and he wouldn't mind too much.
The <i>federales</i> are after him anyway.

1290
01:48:07,832 --> 01:48:09,584
So what with your gun?

1291
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:12,421
- We'll take that chance.
- Get back there.

1292
01:53:20,792 --> 01:53:24,068
- Shooting.
- Volley. Execution, probably.

1293
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:47,382
- Dobbs is dead.
- What?

1294
01:53:47,952 --> 01:53:51,103
- Bandits got him.
- Our goods. What about our goods?

1295
01:53:58,752 --> 01:54:01,664
- What?
- He says our goods are safe in his office.

1296
01:54:03,712 --> 01:54:06,829
- It's not here, Howard.
- Keep your shirt on.

1297
01:54:32,072 --> 01:54:33,187
What?

1298
01:54:47,032 --> 01:54:49,990
He heard the bandits talking
while they were waiting to be shot.

1299
01:54:50,072 --> 01:54:52,586
They thought it was bags of sand
hidden among the hide...

1300
01:54:52,672 --> 01:54:54,867
to make it weigh more
when Dobbs went to sell them.

1301
01:54:54,952 --> 01:54:56,226
Where are they?

1302
01:55:04,072 --> 01:55:06,461
They're in the ruins outside town.
Come on!

1303
01:55:30,792 --> 01:55:32,544
Looks like a norther.

1304
01:57:22,712 --> 01:57:25,909
Laugh, Curtin, old boy,
it's a great joke played on us...

1305
01:57:25,992 --> 01:57:28,506
by the Lord, or fate, or nature,
whatever you prefer...

1306
01:57:28,592 --> 01:57:32,028
but whoever or whatever played it
certainly had a sense of humor!

1307
01:57:32,112 --> 01:57:34,546
The gold has gone back
to where we found it!

1308
01:57:53,272 --> 01:57:56,582
This is worth ten months
of suffering and labor, this joke is!

1309
01:58:22,632 --> 01:58:24,941
Well, Howard, what next I wonder?

1310
01:58:25,432 --> 01:58:28,310
I'm all fixed as far as I'm concerned
as a medicine man.

1311
01:58:28,392 --> 01:58:30,383
I'll have three meals a day, five if I want...

1312
01:58:30,472 --> 01:58:33,145
roof over my head,
and a drink now and then to warm me up.

1313
01:58:33,232 --> 01:58:35,871
I will be worshipped, fed,
and treated like a high priest...

1314
01:58:35,952 --> 01:58:39,661
for telling people what they want to hear.
Good medicine men are born, not made.

1315
01:58:39,752 --> 01:58:41,344
Come and see me sometime, my boy.

1316
01:58:41,432 --> 01:58:44,230
Even you'll take off your hat
when you see how respected I am.

1317
01:58:44,312 --> 01:58:47,145
The day before yesterday,
they wanted to make me their legislature.

1318
01:58:47,232 --> 01:58:48,460
Their whole legislature!

1319
01:58:48,552 --> 01:58:52,147
I don't know what that means. I think
it's the highest honor they can bestow.

1320
01:58:52,232 --> 01:58:54,905
Yeah, I'm all fixed
for the rest of my natural life.

1321
01:58:54,992 --> 01:58:57,028
How about yourself?
What do you aim to do?

1322
01:58:57,112 --> 01:58:58,625
I haven't got any idea.

1323
01:58:58,712 --> 01:59:02,307
You're young. You've got plenty of time
to make three or four fortunes.

1324
01:59:02,752 --> 01:59:05,550
You know, the worst ain't so bad
when it finally happens.

1325
01:59:05,632 --> 01:59:08,430
Not half as bad as you figure it'll be
before it happens.

1326
01:59:08,512 --> 01:59:10,742
I'm no worse off than I was in Tampico.

1327
01:59:10,952 --> 01:59:13,750
All I'm out is $200
when you come right down to it.

1328
01:59:13,832 --> 01:59:16,141
Not very much compared
to what Dobbsie lost.

1329
01:59:16,232 --> 01:59:18,223
Any special place you're bent on going?

1330
01:59:18,312 --> 01:59:20,542
No, all places are the same to me.

1331
01:59:21,072 --> 01:59:24,030
You can keep my share of what the burros
and the hides'll bring...

1332
01:59:24,112 --> 01:59:27,991
if you use it to buy a ticket to Dallas.
See Cody's widow. Better than writing.

1333
01:59:28,072 --> 01:59:31,781
And besides, it's July and the fruit harvest.

1334
01:59:35,952 --> 01:59:37,146
How about it?

1335
01:59:39,272 --> 01:59:40,500
It's a deal.

1336
01:59:43,312 --> 01:59:44,825
Well, let's get going.

1337
01:59:58,912 --> 02:00:00,982
- Goodbye, Curtin.
- Goodbye, Howard.

1338
02:00:01,072 --> 02:00:02,903
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
