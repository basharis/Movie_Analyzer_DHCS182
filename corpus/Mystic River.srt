1
00:00:57,578 --> 00:01:00,141
—before the end
of the season last year…

2
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,981
and then re-injured it
in spring training…

3
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:06,652
on a terrific game-saving play.

4
00:01:06,853 --> 00:01:08,843
You know, I was talking with….

5
00:01:09,055 --> 00:01:12,888
–What time is this going on?
-7:30 is the pre-game.

6
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:16,221
–Who'd you say was pitching tonight?
–Tiant's pitching.

7
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:20,425
–Goddamn Cuban, man. He can hurl it.
–I'd hate to be facing him.

8
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:23,628
–Who are they playing tonight, Yankees?
–Yankees.

9
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:28,132
Imagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball coming
at you. You don't have time to think.

10
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,968
What kind of night
you think Fisk will have?

11
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,168
He's been hot lately.

12
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:38,609
He gets on base twice tonight,
gets on base twice, I'll paint your porch.

13
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:53,688
Save.

14
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:55,123
The sewer.

15
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:04,628
Hold on, I'll get it.

16
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:09,399
Sorry, guys, I guess I don't
know my own strength.

17
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:13,170
You know what, Dave? That must be it.

18
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:20,646
Hey…

19
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,181
you guys know what
would be really cool?

20
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:26,849
–What?
–Driving a car.

21
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:29,136
You know, just around the block.

22
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:31,089
Yeah?

23
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:34,719
Anyone on this street
keep their keys in their car?

24
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:38,665
I steal a car, my dad will kill me.

25
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:41,701
Just around the block. Who said steal?

26
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,119
Your dad kill you
for writing your name too?

27
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:18,796
See, now it'll be there forever.

28
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:22,469
Me too.

29
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:26,672
Forever.

30
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:32,274
Let me ask you something.

31
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:40,582
You brats think it's okay to destroy
municipal property?

32
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,051
Huh?

33
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:45,522
Come here.

34
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:49,325
Get over here.

35
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:03,875
Well, do you?

36
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,206
–No, sir.
–No, sir.

37
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,813
–No.
–No, what?

38
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,917
Sir.

39
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:16,781
You're the hard case of the group, huh?

40
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:21,682
A pack of punks, huh?

41
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:27,029
You live around here?

42
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:29,325
Right there.

43
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:35,231
You?

44
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:37,395
Right over there.

45
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:41,983
How about you?
Where do you live, son?

46
00:04:43,778 --> 00:04:46,907
–Rester Street.
–Is your mother home?

47
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:58,683
We're gonna go have a talk with her.
Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.

48
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,429
Get in.

49
00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:12,833
Get the fuck inside.

50
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,581
In.

51
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:38,421
You kids go tell your mothers
what you've been up to.

52
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,159
And don't let me catch you shits
ruining my sidewalks again.

53
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:18,723
What do you mean?
Who put Dave in a car?

54
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:20,698
The cop. He had a gold badge.

55
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:24,027
How do you know it was a cop?
See anything on the badge?

56
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,529
–No, no writing.
–He had a uniform on?

57
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,398
Like a regular police uniform?

58
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:30,598
–He was a cop.
–He took Davey.

59
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:34,903
–So, what were you guys doing?
–We wrote our names in the cement, but—

60
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:38,641
You were writing in cement
and playing hockey, but they took Dave?

61
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:43,037
–That doesn't make sense. Come on.
–Is there something wrong, Dad?

62
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,460
Please.

63
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:05,569
No more.

64
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:08,463
Please.

65
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:12,005
No more, please.

66
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:43,799
–Have you seen him?
–Looks like damaged goods to me.

67
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,772
Jesus.

68
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:23,368
You took some good swings today.

69
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,939
Dad, I struck out.

70
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:29,737
Good swings, though. That's what counts.

71
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:33,405
I'll never be a good ballplayer.

72
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:38,179
You're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.

73
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:42,981
Star shortstop, Trinity High School,
1978 to '82.

74
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:45,820
You're gonna be a great ballplayer.

75
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,666
–Hey, see that gutter drain over there?
–Yeah.

76
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:57,368
I used to play on this street
when I was a kid.

77
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,870
That drain swallowed every ball we had.

78
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,497
Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.

79
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,645
If we could get that manhole cover up…

80
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:09,858
could be 1000 balls down there.

81
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,042
Really? Let's try.

82
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,507
Get in.

83
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,511
Come on, Dad,
come help me hunt for balls.

84
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:51,743
Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home
before Mom starts to worry.

85
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,361
Jimmy. Jimmy.

86
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,865
Earth to Mr Markum.

87
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:13,731
–What do you want now, Pete?
–Like I'm Mr Needy all of a sudden?

88
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:16,767
We're out of the Marlboros
and the Winstons are looking grim.

89
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:18,837
–So?
–So that means less profit…

90
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:21,970
and more profit means I get a raise.

91
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:23,840
So why don't you order more.

92
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,906
All right, but if the
surgeon general calls, you're my alibi.

93
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:44,125
–Hey, you.
–Hey, there.

94
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:47,495
I'm going out tonight
with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.

95
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:52,287
Don't stay out too late. You got your
sister's First Communion tomorrow.

96
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:55,201
–Christ, I sound like….
–Someone's father?

97
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,573
Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.

98
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,041
–Later, Daddy.
–Later.

99
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:04,977
Have fun.

100
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,887
–Later.
–Later.

101
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,047
Brendan.

102
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:46,580
–You scared the shit out of me.
–I'm sorry, I didn't want your dad to see me.

103
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,113
He sees you sneaking
into my car, he'll shoot you.

104
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,839
What will he do if he sees this?

105
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:59,163
Shoot you and then kill you.

106
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:05,997
It's been six hours.

107
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,601
I had to see you.

108
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:13,418
I'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.

109
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:17,473
Tomorrow?

110
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:19,775
Like we planned?

111
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:22,382
Tomorrow.

112
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:28,650
Drop me around the corner.

113
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:03,019
–Take it easy.
–He kept cutting me off!

114
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:07,420
He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!

115
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:11,823
He followed me all the way from goddamn
Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me!

116
00:13:11,863 --> 00:13:13,727
That son of a bitch!

117
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:16,669
Can you believe this guy keeps confessing?

118
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,014
I don't know. Maybe we ought to grab
a lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.

119
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:24,795
Hey, Devine?

120
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:32,610
–What you looking at?
–The old neighborhood.

121
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:41,346
–We're done, Sean, but I can stick around.
–No, I think we're good, thanks.

122
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,616
A few of us are going
to the Cantab after.

123
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,890
No, I don't think so, Jen.
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

124
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,125
Yeah.

125
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,027
–So the wife left you six months ago?
–So?

126
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,633
So Jenny Coughlin there
with the body, voice and the cuffs….

127
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,770
This girl, she makes gay guys
rethink their orientation.

128
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,262
So, what's your point?

129
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,308
The girl just wants to bed you,
not wed you. You don't even blink?

130
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,909
She wants to worship
at the temple of Devine.

131
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:15,146
–I'm married, Whitey.
–So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.

132
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:19,549
–You haven't talked to Lauren in six months.
–She calls all the time.

133
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,853
And says absolutely nothing.
Weirdest thing I ever heard of.

134
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:26,889
One of these days, the phone's gonna ring
and she'll tell me why she left.

135
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:30,295
Yeah? Maybe she's waiting
for you to say something.

136
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:52,281
Come on, come on, come on.

137
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:57,083
The pitch. A swing and a line drive
into right field. A base hit.

138
00:14:57,123 --> 00:15:00,423
I just don't feel like
they're gonna win this one.

139
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,192
Could we please have three beers?

140
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:20,007
Yeah, come on.

141
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:35,985
You believe those chicks?

142
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:41,520
–Come on.
–Oh, yeah, baby.

143
00:15:45,498 --> 00:15:47,544
Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?

144
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:51,039
–We've got you right over here, boys.
–Yeah.

145
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:53,001
Yeah.

146
00:15:54,341 --> 00:15:56,933
I've known her since she was a kid.

147
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:09,724
A ball and two strikes. Two on, two out.

148
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:19,826
Dave.

149
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:22,897
It's 3 in the morning.

150
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:24,384
Where have you been?

151
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:29,097
Oh, my God.

152
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:31,837
I fucked up.

153
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:33,963
What happened?

154
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:38,975
This guy tried to mug me,
and I swung on him and he sliced me.

155
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,948
But look at your hand.
We gotta go to the hospital.

156
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,480
No, no, it's not that bad.
It's not that deep.

157
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:50,618
–It bled like hell. I can't go to the hospital.
–Oh, my God, Dave.

158
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:53,956
Come on. Come here.

159
00:16:55,327 --> 00:17:00,277
So I'm walking to my car, and this guy
comes up to me and asks for a light.

160
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:03,630
I say I don't smoke.
He says neither does he.

161
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:07,564
My heart starts clocking a buck fifty
because there's no one around.

162
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:10,178
–Oh, God.
–That's when I see the knife.

163
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:13,404
Says, “Your wallet or your life.
I'm leaving with one of them.”

164
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:15,105
–That's what he said?
–Yeah.

165
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:18,643
So I try to brush past him.
That's when he slices me.

166
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:23,928
–You said you swung on him first.
–Jesus, Celeste, can I tell the fucking story?

167
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:26,385
I'm sorry, babe.

168
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,758
I went fucking nuts on him, baby. I….

169
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:36,858
I went off.

170
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:40,807
I bashed his head on the parking lot.

171
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:44,164
There was blood everywhere.

172
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,675
I might have killed him.

173
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:52,571
Killed him?

174
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,885
It makes you feel…

175
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:05,453
alone, you know, hurting somebody.

176
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,352
Yeah, but you had to, right?

177
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,355
It makes you feel…

178
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,021
alien.

179
00:18:23,473 --> 00:18:25,498
Okay.

180
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,506
Babe, you hop in the shower.

181
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:32,271
And I'll take care of your clothes.

182
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:36,607
–Yeah?
–Yeah.

183
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:38,614
Here.

184
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:54,094
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

185
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,730
There's, like, this car with blood in it,
and the door's open.

186
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,665
–What's the location of the car?
–Sydney Street.

187
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:04,736
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend just found it.

188
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,571
–Son, what's your name?
–He wants to know her name.

189
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:09,307
Your name, what's your name?

190
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:12,317
We're so fucking out of here.
Good luck, man.

191
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:26,317
Dispatch, this is Unit 33.

192
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:31,591
We're gonna need a crime-scene tech,
and you might want to notify Homicide.

193
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:35,668
Thirty-three, have you
found a body yet? Over.

194
00:19:35,837 --> 00:19:40,127
No, but by the looks of this car,
we'll find one sooner or later.

195
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:55,515
–Yeah?
–I'm in the weeds here at the store…

196
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:56,953
and I need some help.

197
00:19:57,122 --> 00:20:01,053
You and Katie can't handle 6,
how you gonna handle the church crowd?

198
00:20:01,093 --> 00:20:04,720
–That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
–Hold on.

199
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:15,900
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

200
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,903
Just call Sal, make sure he can
get there at 8 instead of 10.

201
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:22,638
No-shows at work,
what if she no-shows at church?

202
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:24,077
She'll be there.

203
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:26,975
You know, she's gonna
screw up this day too.

204
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:30,246
Oh, what other day
has she screwed up lately?

205
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:33,114
You got two other daughters,
don't forget.

206
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:36,850
I'll be at the church before anybody else,
don't worry about that.

207
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,881
What the fuck's going on here?

208
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:51,432
–Pete, anybody show?
–No.

209
00:20:51,604 --> 00:20:53,595
Katie didn't call?

210
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:55,501
No.

211
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:08,152
–Hello?
–Drew, Jimmy.

212
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:11,015
Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for Katie.

213
00:21:11,055 --> 00:21:15,081
Yeah, she's here, I think.
Hang on a second, let me go check.

214
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:19,724
Have a nice day.

215
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:23,130
No, it was Diane Cestra
who slept over. No Katie.

216
00:21:23,164 --> 00:21:27,330
Eve said she dropped her off at around
1:00. Didn't say where she was going.

217
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,231
Don't worry, I'll track her down.

218
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:33,234
–She seeing anybody maybe?
-19-year-old girls, who can keep a tally?

219
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:36,772
–That's the cold truth, bud.
–I'll talk to you later.

220
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,779
I'll take hookers
over old ladies any day.

221
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:50,653
–Mind if I go grab a smoke?
–You can smoke the whole pack.

222
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:05,330
Can I help you, Brendan?

223
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:09,866
No, Mr Markum, I'm looking
for some of that tea that my ma likes.

224
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:13,136
–That's Barry's. Next aisle.
–Thanks.

225
00:22:27,122 --> 00:22:29,696
–When's Sal getting here?
–Anytime now.

226
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:32,826
–That it, Bren?
–A Globe.

227
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,919
I thought Katie worked on Sundays.

228
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,161
Are you sweet
on my man's daughter, Bren?

229
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:43,235
No, I just see her here sometimes.

230
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:46,935
Her little sister's making
her First Communion today.

231
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,140
Thanks. Come on, Ray.

232
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:04,999
Can I ask you something, Jimmy?

233
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:07,353
Shoot.

234
00:23:07,858 --> 00:23:09,970
Why do you hate that kid so bad?

235
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:14,913
It's not hate. Doesn't that little
mute fucker spook you out sometimes?

236
00:23:14,931 --> 00:23:17,457
No, not Silent Ray, Brendan.

237
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:21,898
He's nice. Does sign language with
his brother even though he doesn't have to.

238
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:23,966
He doesn't want him to feel alone.

239
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:27,372
But you look at Brendan
like you're two steps away…

240
00:23:27,376 --> 00:23:30,404
from slicing off his nose
and feeding it to him.

241
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:33,413
–No. Really?
–Straight up.

242
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:40,151
Here's Sal. About fucking time.

243
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,932
–Hey, there, bad boy.
–Sarge.

244
00:23:57,101 --> 00:24:01,835
This should be the city's,
but the park's state jurisdiction.

245
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,910
So if the body's in there,
the case is ours.

246
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,574
How much evidence do you
think they've destroyed?

247
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,875
Let's go find out.

248
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:16,079
Parker Hill vic walks into the ER on his own,
steak knife sticking out of his collarbone.

249
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,482
He asks the nurse, “Hey, where
they keep the Coke machine?”

250
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:23,084
–Did she tell him?
–Tom, what do we got on the car so far?

251
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:26,921
We found the registration in the glove box.
Owner is Katherine Markum.

252
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:28,611
–Oh, shit.
–You know her?

253
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:31,392
Maybe. Might be the daughter
of a guy I know.

254
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:35,129
We found a wallet and a license
in a backpack. She's 19.

255
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:39,366
–Oh, fuck, that's her.
–Is it a problem? You close with the guy?

256
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:43,828
When we were kids. Now it's just
a “hello” around the neighborhood.

257
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:47,744
Nineteen.

258
00:24:47,914 --> 00:24:49,710
Fuck, man.

259
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:52,475
He's in for a world of hurt.

260
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:22,209
Do not make her laugh.

261
00:25:29,984 --> 00:25:32,512
Door was ajar when we found it,
headlights on.

262
00:25:32,552 --> 00:25:36,983
Blood on the driver's door, speaker,
more blood on top of the steering wheel…

263
00:25:37,023 --> 00:25:41,455
around this bullet hole. Punched through
the driver's seatback, shoulder level.

264
00:25:41,495 --> 00:25:43,673
Okay, perp stood outside the car…

265
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:46,792
girl slams him with the door,
perp gets a round off…

266
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:49,800
hits her in the shoulder, maybe the bicep.

267
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:53,199
She runs for it
through the trampled weeds….

268
00:25:54,807 --> 00:25:58,070
–What do you think?
–Yeah, I dig that.

269
00:25:58,977 --> 00:26:01,274
Body of Christ.

270
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:04,644
–Body of Christ.
–Amen.

271
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:08,941
My God, Jimmy, our baby.

272
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,616
Body of Christ.

273
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:18,787
Body of Christ.

274
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:22,291
Body of Christ.

275
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,529
So I'm thinking she hid
out here for a little bit.

276
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:29,163
The killer shows, she bolts.

277
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:32,899
She goes to the other side,
she takes off running again.

278
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,504
Well, we better call in some divers
while we're at it.

279
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:45,382
Body of Christ.

280
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:49,781
Body of Christ.

281
00:26:59,997 --> 00:27:03,330
So you haven't seen him
in a long time or what?

282
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:08,130
No, I haven't seen him since we were kids.
Once in a while, I run into him.

283
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,546
Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?

284
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,470
–Daddy, Daddy!
–Hey, darling. Good day, huh?

285
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:16,133
This dress itches.

286
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:20,041
Yeah, I'm not even wearing it,
and it's itching me.

287
00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:22,513
We are so proud of you.

288
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:43,861
Morning, honey.

289
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:48,366
Dave, there's nothing about it
in the papers. I checked three times.

290
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:51,603
It was late, real late.

291
00:27:53,545 --> 00:27:55,978
–Morning, Mikey.
–Morning, Dad.

292
00:27:56,847 --> 00:28:01,071
–You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
–Yeah, come on, let's go.

293
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:04,119
Come on.

294
00:28:06,891 --> 00:28:09,121
Put your coat on, Mike.

295
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:11,385
Thanks, Mom.

296
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,035
–Hey, Jimmy.
–What's up, Ed?

297
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:28,035
They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.

298
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:32,441
Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going
into the Pen. Why you all decked out?

299
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:35,408
–Nadine's First Communion.
–What are you doing here?

300
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:37,973
Just curious, I guess.

301
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,419
That's my daughter's car.

302
00:28:55,098 --> 00:28:56,748
That's my daughter's car.

303
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:02,332
The dog's sniffing
something by the old bear cage.

304
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:04,233
–Want to take a walk over?
–Yeah.

305
00:29:04,273 --> 00:29:06,451
–Trooper Devine?
–Yeah, go ahead.

306
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:09,072
We got a guy on Sydney
says he's the father.

307
00:29:09,112 --> 00:29:10,578
Oh, shit.

308
00:29:10,746 --> 00:29:13,342
–Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
–En route.

309
00:29:13,382 --> 00:29:16,352
Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

310
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:20,049
Asking for you. Says he knows you.
Not taking no for an answer.

311
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:22,017
And he's got some guys with him.

312
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:25,356
–What guys?
–Crazy-looking guys.

313
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:29,986
–The Savage brothers.
–Just a “hi” around the neighborhood, huh?

314
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:32,026
All right, I'm on my way.

315
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:38,598
–Hey, guys.
–That's our niece in there.

316
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:40,465
–Let us in.
–We're doing our job.

317
00:29:40,505 --> 00:29:41,901
–Let us in.
–Fuck you!

318
00:29:41,941 --> 00:29:43,769
The doughnut shop's that way!

319
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:46,607
–Nick, Val, ease up.
–Fucking dickhead.

320
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:48,803
–Enough.
–Nick.

321
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,444
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

322
00:29:53,484 --> 00:29:55,918
–Kevin, let's go.
–And, guys?

323
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:59,884
These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

324
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,016
–But get answers.
–You got it.

325
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:09,422
Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.

326
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:13,590
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

327
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:16,498
–Is she in there?
–All we're doing is looking.

328
00:30:16,538 --> 00:30:20,368
–Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
–That's my daughter's car.

329
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:23,434
–I understand.
–And it's got blood in it.

330
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:28,075
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

331
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:32,914
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

332
00:30:32,954 --> 00:30:35,198
–Trooper Devine?
–Yeah, say again.

333
00:30:35,354 --> 00:30:38,452
Sergeant Powers says you need
to get in here A SAP.

334
00:30:38,492 --> 00:30:42,257
–Your location?
–The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.

335
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:44,259
All right.

336
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:46,607
Make sure he doesn't get through.

337
00:30:46,998 --> 00:30:49,194
You got those bolt cutters in your car?

338
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:53,193
I'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

339
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:55,166
Go.

340
00:30:58,943 --> 00:31:03,207
There's a massive search underway
for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.

341
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:06,042
All we know now
is there are signs of foul play…

342
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:09,052
in a car found abandoned
outside of Pen Park.

343
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:13,548
Now, police officers have moved in quickly
and cordoned off the area…

344
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:17,085
but even as we speak,
a crowd of spectators has gathered.

345
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,554
We don't know more than that,
but we will stay on the story.

346
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:25,930
Until later, this is Jim Smith
reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.

347
00:31:26,534 --> 00:31:28,831
Ready? Bat back.

348
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:33,706
All the way back.

349
00:31:44,582 --> 00:31:47,449
I never saw anything like that before.

350
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:49,977
What do we got?

351
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:01,690
Oh, Christ.

352
00:32:20,882 --> 00:32:22,611
Is that her?

353
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,881
Yeah.

354
00:32:28,055 --> 00:32:31,250
We'll have the father
do a positive ID at the morgue.

355
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,854
Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

356
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:36,889
She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

357
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:41,389
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a.38.

358
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:44,998
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

359
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,229
“Hey, Jimmy…

360
00:32:47,438 --> 00:32:51,398
God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect.”

361
00:32:55,044 --> 00:32:56,568
–Hey.
–Hold on!

362
00:32:56,746 --> 00:33:01,013
–Grab him. Stop that guy.
–Hey, you!

363
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,579
–I'm fucking going in there!
–Take it easy!

364
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,951
–Get his arms.
–Hold him. Come on.

365
00:33:06,123 --> 00:33:09,093
–Let me in, you motherfuckers!
–Take it easy.

366
00:33:09,526 --> 00:33:13,460
–Let me in!
–Is she in there⁈

367
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:18,531
–Sean, is my daughter in there⁈
–Let me in! You motherfuckers!

368
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:22,330
Is my daughter in there⁈ Is she in there⁈
Is she in there⁈

369
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,732
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

370
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:28,207
Is my daughter in there⁈ Motherfuckers!

371
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:31,366
Is that my daughter in there⁈

372
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:34,708
Look into my eyes! Is she in there⁈

373
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:39,442
–Get off me!
–Sean, is that my daughter in there⁈

374
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,383
Is that my daughter in there?

375
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,954
No! No!

376
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:51,219
Oh, no!

377
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,921
No, God!

378
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,533
Oh, God, no!

379
00:34:41,274 --> 00:34:43,970
No one's said anything, right?

380
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:45,802
What do you mean?

381
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:50,505
You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?

382
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:52,614
Jimmy?

383
00:34:52,783 --> 00:34:54,545
–Jimmy, please….
–Please what?

384
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:58,316
–Please—
–Please what, baby? Please what?

385
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:40,920
That's her.

386
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:44,462
That's Katie.

387
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:48,061
That's my daughter.

388
00:36:08,016 --> 00:36:10,143
Fresh-brewed.

389
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:12,751
So we need to work a time line.

390
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,384
It's details, little things
that make a case.

391
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:19,648
You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

392
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:25,225
Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

393
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:28,169
I heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

394
00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:31,430
At the last minute, she changed her mind.

395
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,802
See what I mean?

396
00:36:35,342 --> 00:36:37,502
What do you mean, Jimmy?

397
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,375
What if you or I had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

398
00:36:43,415 --> 00:36:45,411
–What car?
–You're losing me here.

399
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:50,752
If I'd gotten into that car that day,
my life would have been a different thing.

400
00:36:51,188 --> 00:36:54,716
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother…

401
00:36:55,525 --> 00:36:57,858
she was a beautiful woman.

402
00:36:58,362 --> 00:37:00,295
Regal.

403
00:37:01,297 --> 00:37:03,827
As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

404
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:06,529
You had to have balls
to go near her, and I did.

405
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:10,698
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

406
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,688
Now, here's the thing, Sean.

407
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:16,704
If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.

408
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:19,912
I never would have had the juice
to go near her.

409
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:23,111
And Katie never would have been born.

410
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:26,518
And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

411
00:37:31,558 --> 00:37:36,687
–You ever see Dave around?
–He married my cousin Celeste.

412
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:43,665
What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

413
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:45,325
Around 7:30.

414
00:37:45,537 --> 00:37:48,506
Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

415
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:55,244
No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

416
00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:58,506
She was having dinner with her friends.

417
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,978
–Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
–Yeah.

418
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:08,954
She talked to Nadine
about her Communion…

419
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:12,559
and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

420
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:15,127
And then around 8, she left.

421
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:18,423
–Do you know who she talked to?
–No.

422
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,496
Do you mind if we have the phone company
subpoenaed for records?

423
00:38:22,536 --> 00:38:24,767
–No, go ahead.
–Good.

424
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:30,036
You say you spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

425
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:32,566
Yes and no. I was mostly in back.

426
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:35,941
Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

427
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:39,211
No, she was herself, she was happy. She—

428
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:41,181
She what?

429
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,449
It's nothing.

430
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:48,418
Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

431
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:52,189
It's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died…

432
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:56,058
I had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

433
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:59,364
Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter…

434
00:38:59,534 --> 00:39:03,865
but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

435
00:39:03,905 --> 00:39:08,003
For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

436
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:10,705
–Okay.
–It was just a look.

437
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:16,144
It's information. We collect it,
put it together, see what fits. Little things.

438
00:39:16,184 --> 00:39:17,445
You were in prison?

439
00:39:17,618 --> 00:39:19,046
–Oh, Jesus.
–Here we go.

440
00:39:19,086 --> 00:39:21,417
–Whitey.
–I'm just asking.

441
00:39:21,988 --> 00:39:25,952
Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer Island.

442
00:39:25,992 --> 00:39:29,388
Is that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

443
00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:32,926
Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.

444
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:36,299
–Sorry.
–It's all right. It's all right.

445
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:38,765
Okay, Mr Markum.

446
00:39:38,936 --> 00:39:42,429
–Okay.
–Okay. All right. So, Jimmy…

447
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:47,568
outside of the look Katie gave you,
was there anything else?

448
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,443
There was this kid.

449
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:59,249
What am I talking about?
That was this morning.

450
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:01,863
What? Remember, it's the little things.

451
00:40:01,957 --> 00:40:06,122
This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

452
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:09,091
–Barely knew each other.
–Could they have been dating?

453
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:11,045
–No.
–What makes you so sure?

454
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,762
Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

455
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:16,599
Mrs Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

456
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:20,030
No one right now, as far as we know.

457
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:23,437
–I mean, knew.
–I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.

458
00:40:23,477 --> 00:40:26,906
We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

459
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:31,542
All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

460
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:36,053
And if you think of anything…

461
00:40:36,254 --> 00:40:39,917
anything at all, give us a call.

462
00:40:45,796 --> 00:40:48,360
He said you almost got into a car
when you were kids?

463
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,428
Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle
were playing in front of my house.

464
00:40:52,468 --> 00:40:54,497
This car came up and took Dave away.

465
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:57,501
–Abduction?
–Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.

466
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:01,937
Convinced Dave to get in the car,
kept him for four days before he escaped.

467
00:41:01,977 --> 00:41:03,939
–They catch these guys?
–One died.

468
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:06,976
The other got busted,
went the noose route in his cell.

469
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:11,178
Your pal Markum, the moment I laid
eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.

470
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,416
They never lose that tension,
it settles in their shoulders.

471
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:17,350
He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.

472
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,076
No, that's in his stomach.
The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.

473
00:41:26,865 --> 00:41:31,932
Cause of death: the gunshot wound to
the head, not the trauma from the beating.

474
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:36,134
–What else?
–Her and her friends were barhopping.

475
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:39,537
We're interviewing anyone
who might have seen them.

476
00:41:39,577 --> 00:41:42,283
One other thing,
the backpack in her car…

477
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:45,509
had pamphlets on Las Vegas
and a list of Vegas hotels.

478
00:41:45,549 --> 00:41:47,814
It doesn't sound like much.

479
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:50,215
What do you say, Devine?

480
00:41:51,922 --> 00:41:53,617
We'll get the guy, sir.

481
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:57,924
That's right. All right, let's do it.

482
00:42:02,698 --> 00:42:07,252
–That's the best you can come up with?
–It made him happy, didn't it?

483
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:10,861
This is Sean.

484
00:42:11,672 --> 00:42:14,971
–Hello?
–Is it Lauren?

485
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:21,309
You're in Manhattan.
I can tell by the traffic sounds.

486
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,744
Is he with you?

487
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:33,450
Is that the baby?

488
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:37,137
Lauren, at least tell me her name.

489
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:49,533
Yeah, nice talking to you too.

490
00:43:03,485 --> 00:43:05,112
Hey.

491
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:10,887
Would it surprise you?

492
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:12,923
Wouldn't be the first time.

493
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:19,029
Did you see that girl?
Did you see that—?

494
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,190
Did you see her?

495
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:24,897
–I heard a car hit something.
–Hit what? Another car?

496
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:27,933
–Oh, no, not loud like that.
–Like hitting the curb?

497
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:29,838
Yes, maybe.

498
00:43:30,009 --> 00:43:32,978
Then it stalled, and someone said, “Hi.”

499
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:35,271
–Someone said, “Hi”?
–“Hi.”

500
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:38,910
Then there was a loud crack.

501
00:43:39,085 --> 00:43:42,815
–Could it have been a gunshot?
–Yes, maybe.

502
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:46,352
–Did you look out your window, Mrs Prior?
–Oh, no.

503
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:49,515
I was in my dressing gown by then.

504
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:53,288
I don't look out the window
in my dressing gown.

505
00:43:53,328 --> 00:43:56,459
The voice you heard,
was that a male or a female?

506
00:43:56,499 --> 00:43:58,591
Female.

507
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:00,166
I think.

508
00:44:01,002 --> 00:44:04,236
–It sounds like the girl knew the shooter.
–Yeah.

509
00:44:04,238 --> 00:44:06,469
Sorry to trouble you.

510
00:44:14,448 --> 00:44:16,882
–Jimmy.
–Theo.

511
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,546
How's my daughter?
How's Annabeth holding up?

512
00:44:19,586 --> 00:44:21,681
–She's trying.
–Let's get these on ice.

513
00:44:21,721 --> 00:44:24,087
You got a couple of coolers?

514
00:44:30,094 --> 00:44:32,326
Right here's fine.

515
00:44:37,468 --> 00:44:40,868
So how are you handling all this so far?

516
00:44:41,038 --> 00:44:44,007
–It hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
–Yeah?

517
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:46,703
It's gonna hurt like hell when it does.

518
00:44:46,743 --> 00:44:50,474
When my Janey died,
I was no good for six months…

519
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:54,446
but my kids were
all grown up. I had that luxury.

520
00:44:54,617 --> 00:44:58,348
You, you got domestic responsibilities.

521
00:45:00,455 --> 00:45:02,356
Domestic responsibilities?

522
00:45:02,524 --> 00:45:08,134
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls. That's your first priority.

523
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:11,126
Oh, you figured that might
have slipped my mind?

524
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,691
It just needed to be said, that's all.

525
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:17,929
You'll come through
because you're a man.

526
00:45:18,105 --> 00:45:20,399
Like I said to Annabeth,
your wedding day.

527
00:45:20,439 --> 00:45:23,837
I said, “You got yourself
a real old-school man there.”

528
00:45:23,877 --> 00:45:26,470
–Like they put her in a bag.
–What?

529
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:30,008
That's what Katie looked like
when I saw her in the morgue.

530
00:45:30,048 --> 00:45:34,338
Like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes.

531
00:45:35,287 --> 00:45:38,015
–Well—
–Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.

532
00:45:38,055 --> 00:45:41,184
She went to sleep,
she never woke up. Peaceful.

533
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,256
–You don't need to talk about Janey.
–My daughter was murdered.

534
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:50,226
They put a gun to her. As we stand here,
she's on an autopsy slab…

535
00:45:50,266 --> 00:45:53,196
getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders…

536
00:45:53,236 --> 00:45:57,394
and you're talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility?

537
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:02,939
Good to see you, Theo.

538
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:10,572
Eve, just tell them what they want to know.

539
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,781
–Who was she dating?
–We already told the Savages.

540
00:46:13,821 --> 00:46:16,717
–The Savage brothers?
–They were here yesterday.

541
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:20,122
Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?

542
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:22,591
No one special.

543
00:46:25,965 --> 00:46:29,195
You guys were having
a goodbye dinner, right?

544
00:46:29,969 --> 00:46:32,463
–What?
–She was leaving town, wasn't she?

545
00:46:32,503 --> 00:46:35,870
–Going to Las Vegas?
–How do you know?

546
00:46:36,074 --> 00:46:40,943
She closed her bank account,
she had hotel phone numbers.

547
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:45,408
She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.

548
00:46:45,448 --> 00:46:49,078
Well, a 19-year-old girl
doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.

549
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:51,817
So who was she going with?

550
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:56,049
Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?

551
00:46:56,959 --> 00:46:58,221
Brendan.

552
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,620
Excuse me?

553
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:04,162
–Brendan.
–Brendan Harris?

554
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,794
Brendan Harris, yeah.

555
00:47:07,001 --> 00:47:08,798
You got an address?

556
00:47:22,283 --> 00:47:24,215
Hey, Dave.

557
00:47:28,085 --> 00:47:30,020
Hey, Jimmy.

558
00:47:30,188 --> 00:47:33,645
Sorry, I came out for a smoke.

559
00:47:34,493 --> 00:47:37,359
Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.

560
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:46,003
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all day.

561
00:47:46,837 --> 00:47:48,804
How you doing?

562
00:47:49,306 --> 00:47:51,137
How you doing?

563
00:47:52,709 --> 00:47:54,573
What happened to your hand?

564
00:47:55,477 --> 00:47:57,035
This?

565
00:47:58,047 --> 00:48:02,346
I was helping a buddy move a couch.
I slammed it in the doorjamb.

566
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:06,388
Ways you can manage
to hurt yourself, right?

567
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:10,183
It's good to see you.

568
00:48:10,957 --> 00:48:12,221
Yeah?

569
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:20,424
How are our girls holding up?

570
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:22,727
They're doing okay, I guess.

571
00:48:22,936 --> 00:48:27,028
That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

572
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:41,950
It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

573
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,549
Yeah.

574
00:48:50,526 --> 00:48:54,690
I couldn't stand looking through the fridge
to find room for all that food…

575
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,665
we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

576
00:48:57,966 --> 00:49:01,163
–Lot of waste, huh?
–Yeah.

577
00:49:02,536 --> 00:49:06,802
I just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

578
00:49:07,408 --> 00:49:11,901
Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

579
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:22,176
One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little…

580
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:24,780
that girl was neat.

581
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,008
When I got out of the joint…

582
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:34,064
you know, after Marita died…

583
00:49:35,566 --> 00:49:40,560
I remember, I was more afraid
of my little daughter…

584
00:49:41,705 --> 00:49:44,401
than I ever was of being in prison.

585
00:49:52,848 --> 00:49:55,079
I loved her…

586
00:49:56,351 --> 00:49:58,320
most…

587
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:04,685
because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night…

588
00:50:07,361 --> 00:50:13,494
it was like we were the last two people
on Earth. You know, forgotten.

589
00:50:14,168 --> 00:50:16,294
Unwanted.

590
00:50:18,372 --> 00:50:22,869
And it's really starting to piss me off, Dave,
because I can't cry for her.

591
00:50:22,909 --> 00:50:27,003
My own little daughter,
and I can't even cry for her.

592
00:50:31,983 --> 00:50:33,779
Jimmy.

593
00:50:37,922 --> 00:50:39,787
You're crying now.

594
00:50:43,025 --> 00:50:45,153
Yeah, damn.

595
00:50:50,232 --> 00:50:53,200
I just want to hug her one more time.

596
00:50:56,905 --> 00:51:00,602
She was 19 fucking years old.

597
00:51:07,949 --> 00:51:10,193
Do you want me to leave you alone?

598
00:51:10,883 --> 00:51:14,051
No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

599
00:51:14,554 --> 00:51:18,149
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

600
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:37,876
When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

601
00:51:38,143 --> 00:51:42,499
–You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
–She isn't hurt. She's dead.

602
00:51:44,914 --> 00:51:48,940
–I didn't kill her.
–Again, when's the last time you saw her?

603
00:51:50,785 --> 00:51:54,050
About 8—
Saturday night, about 8:00.

604
00:51:54,356 --> 00:51:56,402
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

605
00:51:57,092 --> 00:51:58,889
It was about 8.

606
00:51:59,895 --> 00:52:04,889
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

607
00:52:05,267 --> 00:52:08,564
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

608
00:52:10,171 --> 00:52:11,797
I don't know.

609
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:17,338
But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

610
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:21,479
What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

611
00:52:21,647 --> 00:52:25,947
–He's not a thief.
–He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

612
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:30,982
Daughter probably had the same bad gene.
You count yourself lucky, Bren.

613
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:36,104
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

614
00:52:37,227 --> 00:52:39,719
We were gonna leave Sunday.

615
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:43,869
We were gonna get married
when we got there.

616
00:52:46,136 --> 00:52:48,468
Well, that was the plan, right?

617
00:52:48,772 --> 00:52:51,672
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

618
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,470
–Ma, I was gonna tell you.
–Just like your father, huh?

619
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:06,147
That's my brother, Ray,
and his friend John.

620
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,686
–Hey, boys.
–Hey.

621
00:53:08,922 --> 00:53:10,617
He don't speak.

622
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:15,221
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

623
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:19,551
They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

624
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:25,253
So where were you between 12:30
and 2 a.m on Sunday morning, Brendan?

625
00:53:25,737 --> 00:53:26,999
I was asleep.

626
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:29,349
Can you confirm that, Mrs Harris?

627
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:35,908
I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

628
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,878
He came down for breakfast at 9.

629
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:44,480
I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

630
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:49,668
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take
a polygraph. You think you'd be up for that?

631
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,884
I loved her so much.

632
00:53:55,998 --> 00:53:58,728
I'm never gonna feel that again.

633
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,694
It doesn't happen twice.

634
00:54:03,938 --> 00:54:06,168
Doesn't happen once most times.

635
00:54:07,707 --> 00:54:09,538
Celeste.

636
00:54:10,643 --> 00:54:14,867
–Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
–What are you still doing here?

637
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,075
I don't know.

638
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:22,888
I don't know, I just….

639
00:54:24,088 --> 00:54:25,919
Did Annabeth get to sleep?

640
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:28,817
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.

641
00:54:28,994 --> 00:54:31,985
–Could I get one of those?
–Yeah.

642
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:39,636
One for the road and then home.

643
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,704
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

644
00:54:48,878 --> 00:54:50,708
You've done enough.

645
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,724
To you and Dave for being here for this.

646
00:55:14,334 --> 00:55:17,700
Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.

647
00:55:19,005 --> 00:55:22,068
I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

648
00:55:22,108 --> 00:55:23,768
Good night.

649
00:55:24,742 --> 00:55:27,337
–Good night.
–Yeah, good night.

650
00:55:47,062 --> 00:55:48,495
Hello?

651
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:55,293
Christ. Lauren, say something.

652
00:56:01,475 --> 00:56:04,240
“Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?”

653
00:56:05,012 --> 00:56:08,742
Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing things
made sense.

654
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:14,855
I'm tired of caring about some dead girl, and
there's just gonna be another one after her.

655
00:56:15,186 --> 00:56:19,784
Sending killers to jail is sending them where
they've been heading all their lives.

656
00:56:19,824 --> 00:56:21,850
The dead are still dead.

657
00:56:24,495 --> 00:56:26,827
Jesus, I…

658
00:56:26,998 --> 00:56:29,125
can't do this tonight.

659
00:56:29,434 --> 00:56:31,197
I just….

660
00:56:32,269 --> 00:56:34,032
I can't do it.

661
00:56:34,405 --> 00:56:36,201
Bye, baby.

662
00:56:46,915 --> 00:56:48,542
Because…

663
00:56:49,684 --> 00:56:53,175
sometimes the man wasn't a man at all.

664
00:56:53,387 --> 00:56:55,083
He was the boy.

665
00:56:56,023 --> 00:56:59,049
The boy who escaped from wolves.

666
00:57:00,127 --> 00:57:02,721
An animal of the dusk.

667
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:04,895
Invisible.

668
00:57:05,331 --> 00:57:07,197
Silent.

669
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:09,859
Living in a world…

670
00:57:10,036 --> 00:57:12,368
the others never saw.

671
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,773
World of fireflies.

672
00:57:18,376 --> 00:57:22,837
Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

673
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:27,951
Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

674
00:57:39,529 --> 00:57:44,396
I just gotta get my head right.

675
00:57:47,336 --> 00:57:50,565
Catch a nice, long sleep.

676
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:54,009
And the boy will go back to his forest.

677
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:59,203
Back to his fireflies.

678
00:58:06,752 --> 00:58:08,186
Is he asleep?

679
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:32,172
How's Jimmy and everybody?

680
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,971
Okay.

681
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,007
It's weird.

682
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,543
Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

683
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:44,017
Dave? Dave.

684
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,600
There's still nothing in the paper.

685
00:58:49,892 --> 00:58:51,620
About what?

686
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:53,821
About what?

687
00:58:56,564 --> 00:59:00,854
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
hurt him as bad as I thought.

688
00:59:01,234 --> 00:59:04,270
He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

689
00:59:06,906 --> 00:59:08,568
Yeah.

690
00:59:08,775 --> 00:59:10,299
Right.

691
00:59:12,578 --> 00:59:15,137
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

692
00:59:15,947 --> 00:59:18,507
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.

693
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:22,414
That seems more important right now.

694
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:55,448
I know in my soul I contributed
to your death.

695
00:59:56,483 --> 00:59:58,950
But I don't know how.

696
01:00:18,804 --> 01:00:20,765
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

697
01:00:20,805 --> 01:00:23,634
Good. I didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

698
01:00:23,674 --> 01:00:25,101
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

699
01:00:25,141 --> 01:00:29,273
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

700
01:00:29,313 --> 01:00:32,175
All people who, I'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

701
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:34,911
Considering the crime, maybe.

702
01:00:35,184 --> 01:00:36,516
Dave Boyle?

703
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,583
Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

704
01:00:40,623 --> 01:00:41,886
Could be.

705
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:45,654
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

706
01:00:45,694 --> 01:00:49,424
–Clam up for no reason, huh?
–We'll see.

707
01:01:00,673 --> 01:01:02,301
Hey, Boyle!

708
01:01:03,043 --> 01:01:05,605
–What's it been, seven, eight years?
–Yeah.

709
01:01:05,645 --> 01:01:07,113
Yeah. How you doing?

710
01:01:07,446 --> 01:01:08,908
This is my son, Michael.

711
01:01:08,948 --> 01:01:11,444
Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.

712
01:01:11,484 --> 01:01:14,282
I'm an old buddy of your dad's. Hi.

713
01:01:14,954 --> 01:01:18,315
–So you still with the staties?
–Homicide. This is my partner.

714
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:21,219
–Sergeant Powers. How are you?
–So you got a minute?

715
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:25,656
–We'd love to ask some quick questions.
–I was just gonna walk Michael to school.

716
01:01:25,696 --> 01:01:29,759
–I can be back in a few minutes.
–Tell you what, we'll walk with you, okay?

717
01:01:29,799 --> 01:01:31,289
Sure.

718
01:01:32,902 --> 01:01:34,665
So you look good.

719
01:01:35,203 --> 01:01:38,367
–I hear rents are rising.
–Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

720
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:41,170
They're cutting my dad's old house up
into condos.

721
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,138
We walked by there the other day.

722
01:01:43,178 --> 01:01:45,541
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

723
01:01:45,581 --> 01:01:48,143
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

724
01:01:48,183 --> 01:01:52,779
“Neighborhood needs a fucking crime wave.
Get property values where they belong.”

725
01:01:52,819 --> 01:01:57,451
Young girls keep getting murdered up in Pen
Park, Mr Boyle, you might get your wish.

726
01:01:57,491 --> 01:01:59,981
Dave. Call me Dave.

727
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,094
You said the F-word, Dad.

728
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,293
Yeah, I know. Walk on up ahead, Michael.

729
01:02:05,465 --> 01:02:08,592
Us guys need to talk. Go on.

730
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:12,704
–So, what's up, Sean?
–Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

731
01:02:12,871 --> 01:02:15,967
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

732
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:18,100
–Who's Celeste?
–My wife.

733
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:22,542
–How's Jimmy doing?
–It's hard to tell. You know him.

734
01:02:22,714 --> 01:02:26,146
–Yeah, so the reason we came by—
–Listen, I saw her.

735
01:02:26,883 --> 01:02:31,448
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

736
01:02:31,488 --> 01:02:33,616
That's what we wanted to talk about.

737
01:02:33,656 --> 01:02:37,721
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

738
01:02:37,761 --> 01:02:40,189
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

739
01:02:40,229 --> 01:02:43,755
–Pretty drunk, huh?
–But it was harmless.

740
01:02:43,965 --> 01:02:47,163
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

741
01:02:47,203 --> 01:02:48,853
What time did they leave?

742
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:52,099
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

743
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:55,267
–So we'll say 12:45?
–Sounds about right.

744
01:02:56,311 --> 01:02:58,937
You see anything unusual
or anyone—?

745
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:00,773
Michael.

746
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,009
–Like what?
–I don't know.

747
01:03:03,183 --> 01:03:04,645
A guy watching the girls?

748
01:03:04,685 --> 01:03:07,523
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

749
01:03:08,855 --> 01:03:13,552
No. No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

750
01:03:13,592 --> 01:03:16,925
–See you later, Dad.
–You got your milk money?

751
01:03:23,968 --> 01:03:25,959
Fuck, I hated school.

752
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,028
What?

753
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,533
Yeah, me too, Sean.

754
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:38,341
Just one more thing, Mr Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

755
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:41,474
–Home.
–Home by 1:15, would you say?

756
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:44,447
–Roughly. Sure.
–All right.

757
01:03:46,154 --> 01:03:49,650
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

758
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,817
–Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
–All right.

759
01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:01,091
What?

760
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,867
What happened to him in that car?

761
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:13,007
Can you believe this?

762
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:17,535
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

763
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,380
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives…

764
01:04:22,387 --> 01:04:24,413
you're not left with a whole lot.

765
01:04:24,453 --> 01:04:27,217
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

766
01:04:27,257 --> 01:04:31,588
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

767
01:04:31,628 --> 01:04:33,722
Hears a gunshot,
before that a “hi”…

768
01:04:33,762 --> 01:04:37,126
which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

769
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:41,930
She turns into the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

770
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:45,967
–She says, “Hi.” He shoots her.
–She slams the door into him, takes off.

771
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,802
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

772
01:04:48,842 --> 01:04:51,605
–I don't know. Something in the street.
–Maybe.

773
01:04:51,645 --> 01:04:55,041
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

774
01:04:55,081 --> 01:04:59,513
–She hit hard enough to get a jump on him?
–Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

775
01:04:59,553 --> 01:05:03,250
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

776
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:06,618
Wait a second, how did we get to
Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

777
01:05:06,658 --> 01:05:09,488
–We just got to him.
–He's a guy who was in the bar.

778
01:05:09,528 --> 01:05:12,424
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

779
01:05:12,464 --> 01:05:14,726
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

780
01:05:14,766 --> 01:05:18,563
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

781
01:05:18,603 --> 01:05:20,764
Just a little one.

782
01:05:25,775 --> 01:05:30,131
I'd recommend two sets of visiting hours,
from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

783
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,341
–Sure.
–Good.

784
01:05:33,917 --> 01:05:38,718
–Have you thought about flowers?
–I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

785
01:05:39,054 --> 01:05:40,384
Good.

786
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,694
And the notice?

787
01:05:48,529 --> 01:05:49,893
Notice?

788
01:05:51,297 --> 01:05:56,297
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

789
01:05:56,337 --> 01:05:59,031
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

790
01:05:59,071 --> 01:06:00,766
Where's my daughter?

791
01:06:03,277 --> 01:06:05,335
Downstairs, in the basement.

792
01:06:06,178 --> 01:06:07,475
I wanna see her.

793
01:06:54,822 --> 01:06:57,153
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

794
01:06:58,591 --> 01:07:01,652
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

795
01:07:02,062 --> 01:07:05,164
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

796
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:11,159
Did you say something, Mr Markum?

797
01:07:14,605 --> 01:07:16,538
The notice.

798
01:07:17,841 --> 01:07:20,208
It should read: “Katherine Markum…

799
01:07:21,878 --> 01:07:25,369
beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased…

800
01:07:26,116 --> 01:07:30,381
stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to—”

801
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,156
“Sister to Sara and Nadine.”

802
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:18,553
–You guys again?
–Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.

803
01:08:19,497 --> 01:08:21,795
–You dropping in on Jimmy?
–Yeah.

804
01:08:21,999 --> 01:08:24,894
Do you have some kind of, what,
break in the case?

805
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:28,036
No, just paying our respects.
Where you off to?

806
01:08:28,103 --> 01:08:32,869
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes. I'm
gonna go get some. See you in a minute.

807
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:36,742
By the way, Mr Boyle, what happened
to your hand there?

808
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:43,180
Garbage disposal. It jammed, I stuck
my hand in, it started again.

809
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:45,046
–Stupid.
–Painful.

810
01:08:49,423 --> 01:08:51,755
Garbage disposal. Bullshit.

811
01:08:51,925 --> 01:08:56,017
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
he killed anybody either. Come on.

812
01:09:09,542 --> 01:09:12,511
–Heard you could use one.
–Thanks.

813
01:09:13,878 --> 01:09:18,432
–I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?
–Whatever you need right now.

814
01:09:19,951 --> 01:09:21,941
Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.

815
01:09:27,191 --> 01:09:30,453
I got a couple errands I gotta run.
I'll be back in an hour.

816
01:09:30,493 --> 01:09:33,288
You don't have to come back, Celeste.
I'll be fine.

817
01:09:33,328 --> 01:09:34,623
–Sure?
–Celeste Boyle?

818
01:09:34,663 --> 01:09:36,131
Yeah.

819
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:39,827
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.

820
01:09:39,867 --> 01:09:42,893
–Mrs Boyle.
–Nice to meet you.

821
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:44,560
Look, I gotta go.

822
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:51,170
Oh, damn it.
I left my report pad in the cruiser.

823
01:09:51,344 --> 01:09:53,905
–You better go get it.
–Yeah.

824
01:09:54,748 --> 01:09:56,214
Come on.

825
01:10:01,353 --> 01:10:04,790
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you
a quick question?

826
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:07,919
–Me?
–What time did Dave get home on Saturday?

827
01:10:07,959 --> 01:10:09,721
–What?
–It's a little thing.

828
01:10:09,761 --> 01:10:13,624
We're running a time line on everything
involving Katie. I'm sure…

829
01:10:13,664 --> 01:10:16,106
Dave told you he saw her
at McGill's.

830
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,462
You think Dave killed Katie?

831
01:10:19,937 --> 01:10:23,897
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?

832
01:10:25,609 --> 01:10:29,206
–I don't know.
–No, no. It's just that we could figure out…

833
01:10:29,246 --> 01:10:32,907
what time she was on the road
if we knew what time Dave got home.

834
01:10:32,947 --> 01:10:36,145
See, it's 5 minutes from your place
to McGill's…

835
01:10:36,318 --> 01:10:40,215
and Katie left 15 minutes
before Dave did. You see what I mean.

836
01:10:40,255 --> 01:10:41,722
I was asleep.

837
01:10:44,392 --> 01:10:49,623
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.

838
01:10:49,796 --> 01:10:52,127
Okay. Well, thanks.

839
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:04,570
Bullshit.

840
01:11:04,777 --> 01:11:06,437
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.

841
01:11:06,477 --> 01:11:10,275
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.

842
01:11:10,315 --> 01:11:12,163
Brendan Harris confirmed it.

843
01:11:12,484 --> 01:11:14,002
Remember what you said?

844
01:11:14,217 --> 01:11:19,497
How she looked at you on Saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again?

845
01:11:20,357 --> 01:11:24,189
–Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
–No.

846
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,951
You're 100 percent sure?

847
01:11:26,629 --> 01:11:32,041
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her.

848
01:11:33,936 --> 01:11:36,837
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.

849
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:39,600
Why are you so dead set
against that kid?

850
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:44,194
He said Katie told him you'd disowned her
if she ever dated a Harris.

851
01:11:44,979 --> 01:11:48,241
I knew his father. They called him
“Just Ray” Harris.

852
01:11:48,281 --> 01:11:49,646
Why is that?

853
01:11:51,685 --> 01:11:54,447
There were so many Rays
in the neighborhood.

854
01:11:54,487 --> 01:11:58,616
You had “Crazy Ray” Bucheck,
“Psycho Ray” Dorian.

855
01:11:59,658 --> 01:12:02,956
The cool names were taken,
so he got stuck with “Just Ray.”

856
01:12:02,996 --> 01:12:06,098
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.

857
01:12:06,664 --> 01:12:11,878
And he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers.

858
01:12:11,935 --> 01:12:13,597
I don't know.

859
01:12:13,904 --> 01:12:17,034
I just figure the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

860
01:12:17,074 --> 01:12:22,684
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris
dating Katie or any other daughter of mine.

861
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,210
I can't believe we're talking about
Just Ray Harris.

862
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:29,946
How about this? We've interviewed
witnesses…

863
01:12:29,986 --> 01:12:32,248
canvassed people
who were in the bar.

864
01:12:32,288 --> 01:12:36,315
We've run into more than a few of them
who were questioned…

865
01:12:36,491 --> 01:12:39,983
before us by one or more
of the Savage brothers.

866
01:12:40,161 --> 01:12:43,426
–So?
–So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.

867
01:12:43,632 --> 01:12:47,494
–Some people don't talk to policemen, Sean.
–With all due respect…

868
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:50,306
and just so we're clear,
this is our case.

869
01:12:50,803 --> 01:12:53,238
–How long?
–How long what?

870
01:12:53,573 --> 01:12:56,135
How long before you catch
my daughter's killer?

871
01:12:56,175 --> 01:12:57,693
You bargaining with us?

872
01:12:59,345 --> 01:13:00,642
Bargaining?

873
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:04,178
You giving us a deadline?

874
01:13:07,184 --> 01:13:11,018
We'll speak for Katie, Mr Markum.
If that's okay with you.

875
01:13:12,223 --> 01:13:16,909
Just find my daughter's killer, sergeant.
I'm not standing in your way.

876
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:24,627
The last thing we need is Markum
and the Savages putting the fear of God…

877
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:27,863
into the neighborhood.
–We grew up terrified of them.

878
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:31,667
Eleven months apart, like their mother ran
a loose-cannon factory.

879
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:34,174
Fucking knuckleheads.

880
01:13:37,211 --> 01:13:39,440
Ballistics are in on the Markum murder.

881
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,846
–Yeah, you got a match?
–You're gonna love it.

882
01:13:44,018 --> 01:13:47,384
It's a perfect match.
Gun was a.38 Smith.

883
01:13:47,554 --> 01:13:51,854
Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer
in New Hampshire in 1982.

884
01:13:52,025 --> 01:13:57,290
The same gun that killed Katherine Markum
was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.

885
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:58,823
–In Buckingham.
–The Flats?

886
01:13:58,863 --> 01:14:03,494
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
I pulled the file.

887
01:14:03,668 --> 01:14:07,764
It was a two-man job.
They fired a warning shot into a wall.

888
01:14:07,971 --> 01:14:11,533
–That's where the bullet got pulled.
–Nice work.

889
01:14:11,742 --> 01:14:13,836
Thought you'd like that.

890
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:45,505
It's okay, Ray.

891
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:48,103
Don't worry about it.

892
01:15:02,154 --> 01:15:03,485
Ma said that?

893
01:15:06,057 --> 01:15:07,377
That I'm better off?

894
01:15:13,164 --> 01:15:16,098
I loved her! You know what that's like?

895
01:15:16,532 --> 01:15:17,762
Huh?

896
01:15:22,938 --> 01:15:24,803
I'm sorry.

897
01:15:32,881 --> 01:15:34,713
No, you're wrong.

898
01:15:35,884 --> 01:15:38,148
I won't ever feel that again.

899
01:15:38,886 --> 01:15:44,166
Right there. Went in through a bottle
of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.

900
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:48,192
–Scary, huh?
–Scarier than a glass of milk, right?

901
01:15:48,361 --> 01:15:51,057
So take me through it.
These two guys come in….

902
01:15:51,097 --> 01:15:54,931
In rubber masks.
They came in through here.

903
01:15:57,269 --> 01:15:59,794
That's the storeroom.

904
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:04,503
There's a door back there
that leads to a loading dock.

905
01:16:04,809 --> 01:16:07,040
I always keep that door locked.

906
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:10,714
So they must have had a key.

907
01:16:10,882 --> 01:16:14,816
A key? So, what you're saying
is that it was an inside job?

908
01:16:14,984 --> 01:16:19,274
It had to be. One of them, at least,
worked for me at some point.

909
01:16:19,456 --> 01:16:24,553
The only reason they fired that goddamn
warning shot was they must have known…

910
01:16:24,593 --> 01:16:26,455
I kept this under the counter.

911
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:30,124
–And you told the police that at the time.
–Yeah.

912
01:16:31,065 --> 01:16:33,728
Sure, they went through
my employment records.

913
01:16:33,768 --> 01:16:36,497
Questioned everybody
who used to work for me.

914
01:16:36,537 --> 01:16:39,734
–Never made an arrest.
–Still have a copy of those records?

915
01:16:39,774 --> 01:16:44,711
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there.
But I know who did it.

916
01:16:44,878 --> 01:16:46,345
Oh, yeah?

917
01:16:46,513 --> 01:16:49,285
This guy I fired a couple
of weeks before.

918
01:16:49,415 --> 01:16:53,351
Son of a bitch came in here
a few days after the robbery.

919
01:16:53,486 --> 01:16:57,752
He had this fucking goddamn grin
on his face.

920
01:16:57,922 --> 01:16:59,982
And I just knew.

921
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,854
Go tell a grin to a jury, right?

922
01:17:03,561 --> 01:17:05,392
You remember his name?

923
01:17:06,396 --> 01:17:08,364
Do I look senile to you?

924
01:17:08,732 --> 01:17:11,030
–No, sir.
–Name…

925
01:17:11,236 --> 01:17:13,203
was Ray Harris.

926
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:16,595
We used to call him “Just Ray.”

927
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:22,609
You say they used the same gun
for another crime?

928
01:17:23,446 --> 01:17:27,109
–That's correct, sir.
–Thanks for your help, Mr Looney.

929
01:17:39,094 --> 01:17:40,957
Where you been?

930
01:17:42,263 --> 01:17:43,957
Out.

931
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,191
What you watching?

932
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:51,462
Some vampire movie.

933
01:17:52,171 --> 01:17:54,730
Guy just got his head torn off.

934
01:17:56,508 --> 01:17:58,668
Where'd you go, Celeste?

935
01:18:03,048 --> 01:18:05,277
I was sitting in my car…

936
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:08,913
down by the channel.
You know…

937
01:18:09,554 --> 01:18:11,006
thinking about things.

938
01:18:12,756 --> 01:18:16,123
–What'd you think about?
–Oh, you know….

939
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:19,517
No, actually, I don't know.

940
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:28,565
Things. You know, the day.

941
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:33,036
About Katie being dead.

942
01:18:33,641 --> 01:18:36,508
And poor Annabeth and Jimmy, you know…

943
01:18:37,211 --> 01:18:39,075
those things.

944
01:18:39,446 --> 01:18:41,437
Those things.

945
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:44,682
Know what I was thinking about, huh?

946
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:47,809
Vampires.

947
01:18:49,554 --> 01:18:50,818
What about them?

948
01:18:52,693 --> 01:18:55,819
They're undead…

949
01:18:55,995 --> 01:18:59,190
but I think maybe there's
something beautiful about it.

950
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:02,926
Maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what it's like…

951
01:19:02,968 --> 01:19:05,212
to be human.
Maybe then it's okay.

952
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:08,778
What the fuck you talking about, Dave?

953
01:19:08,839 --> 01:19:11,239
Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.

954
01:19:11,409 --> 01:19:13,467
You're not making any sense.

955
01:19:16,512 --> 01:19:18,241
You think I killed Katie?

956
01:19:18,415 --> 01:19:20,541
–Celeste.
–What—?

957
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:25,080
–Is that the sense we're making these days?
–Where'd you come up with that?

958
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,650
You've barely looked at me since you found
out Katie was dead.

959
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:30,552
In fact, you seem repulsed by me.

960
01:19:30,592 --> 01:19:32,354
–Dave!
–What?

961
01:19:32,526 --> 01:19:37,259
I don't think anything.
I'm confused, okay?

962
01:19:37,431 --> 01:19:39,393
Even your friend Sean
asked about—

963
01:19:39,433 --> 01:19:41,661
He's not my friend, if you didn't know.

964
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:46,330
He asked me about you.
What time you came home.

965
01:19:47,007 --> 01:19:50,738
–What'd you tell him?
–I said I was asleep.

966
01:19:51,311 --> 01:19:54,545
–That's good thinking, baby.
–Jesus Christ, Dave!

967
01:19:54,613 --> 01:19:57,676
–Why don't you tell them about the mugger?
–The mugger?

968
01:19:57,716 --> 01:20:00,446
The mugger! I see how
your mind's working. I do.

969
01:20:00,486 --> 01:20:03,815
I come home with blood on me
the same night Katie's murdered.

970
01:20:03,855 --> 01:20:05,835
I must have killed her, right?

971
01:20:05,957 --> 01:20:07,651
Fuck!

972
01:20:35,483 --> 01:20:36,972
Henry….

973
01:20:37,619 --> 01:20:40,108
What? Henry?

974
01:20:42,388 --> 01:20:44,856
Henry and George.

975
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,789
I never told anyone that before.

976
01:20:52,699 --> 01:20:54,217
Those were their names.

977
01:20:55,734 --> 01:20:58,294
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

978
01:21:01,473 --> 01:21:04,707
At least that's what they called themselves,
but…

979
01:21:05,643 --> 01:21:09,205
they were wolves, and Dave…

980
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:13,838
was the boy who escaped from wolves.

981
01:21:16,052 --> 01:21:18,230
What are you talking about, Dave?

982
01:21:18,755 --> 01:21:21,154
I'm talking Henry and George.

983
01:21:22,191 --> 01:21:24,954
They took me on a four-day ride.

984
01:21:25,694 --> 01:21:31,029
They buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag.

985
01:21:31,866 --> 01:21:34,767
And, man, Celeste…

986
01:21:34,969 --> 01:21:36,698
did they have their fun.

987
01:21:38,638 --> 01:21:42,039
And no one came to help old Dave then.

988
01:21:44,043 --> 01:21:48,810
Dave had to pretend to be somebody else.

989
01:21:53,852 --> 01:21:56,446
You mean, all those years ago…

990
01:21:59,357 --> 01:22:01,791
when you were a little boy?

991
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,087
Dave….

992
01:22:05,263 --> 01:22:07,321
Dave's dead.

993
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:13,583
I don't know who came out of that cellar,
but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!

994
01:22:14,137 --> 01:22:15,569
You see, honey—

995
01:22:15,738 --> 01:22:17,228
Fuck!

996
01:22:17,507 --> 01:22:20,100
It's like vampires.

997
01:22:23,145 --> 01:22:25,137
Once it's in you…

998
01:22:26,615 --> 01:22:28,514
it stays.

999
01:22:29,918 --> 01:22:31,942
What stays?

1000
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:42,321
Did you know there were child prostitutes
in Rome Basin?

1001
01:22:42,695 --> 01:22:44,162
What?

1002
01:22:49,968 --> 01:22:51,459
Fuck!

1003
01:22:54,772 --> 01:22:57,706
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.

1004
01:22:57,875 --> 01:22:59,901
I'm warning you…

1005
01:23:01,746 --> 01:23:03,577
I can't trust my mind.

1006
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:10,486
I gotta go out,
try to get my head around it.

1007
01:23:12,255 --> 01:23:13,745
Okay.

1008
01:23:18,295 --> 01:23:19,784
Okay.

1009
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:21,660
Okay.

1010
01:23:23,364 --> 01:23:27,396
–The gun sends us in a different direction.
–I don't see it that way.

1011
01:23:27,436 --> 01:23:30,130
What does Just Ray's gun
have to do with Dave?

1012
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:32,099
These things get passed around.

1013
01:23:32,139 --> 01:23:35,270
Just Ray may have blown town,
but his gun never did.

1014
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:38,338
I say we talk with Brendan Harris
in the morning.

1015
01:23:38,378 --> 01:23:42,609
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.

1016
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:47,245
They're hiding something, but Dave Boyle's
as much a killer as Brendan Harris.

1017
01:23:47,285 --> 01:23:51,583
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed…

1018
01:23:51,623 --> 01:23:55,887
sexually abused as a kid.
On paper, this guy should be in jail already.

1019
01:23:55,927 --> 01:23:58,422
Katie Markum
was not sexually abused, see?

1020
01:23:58,462 --> 01:24:01,960
In that equation,
sexual emission is part of the deal.

1021
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,129
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.

1022
01:24:06,169 --> 01:24:07,468
He's not my friend.

1023
01:24:07,638 --> 01:24:12,390
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours.

1024
01:24:26,688 --> 01:24:28,315
Hey, Jimmy.

1025
01:24:29,557 --> 01:24:31,081
You're out late.

1026
01:24:31,258 --> 01:24:32,988
Yeah, you too.

1027
01:24:34,428 --> 01:24:36,225
It's cold, huh?

1028
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,724
Yeah, I guess.

1029
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:47,795
You know, I….

1030
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,331
I been sitting out here…

1031
01:24:50,542 --> 01:24:52,635
over the last few years…

1032
01:24:54,579 --> 01:24:58,674
waiting on Katie to get back
from someplace.

1033
01:24:59,652 --> 01:25:04,998
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
“I'm gonna go sit on the porch for a while.”

1034
01:25:09,258 --> 01:25:11,055
Weird thing is…

1035
01:25:11,895 --> 01:25:13,918
it seemed to bring her back.

1036
01:25:18,466 --> 01:25:20,491
I saw her, you know.

1037
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:24,030
Saw who?

1038
01:25:24,272 --> 01:25:27,366
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.

1039
01:25:29,376 --> 01:25:33,600
–You saw Katie Saturday night?
–Never got around to telling you.

1040
01:25:36,482 --> 01:25:38,178
Did you talk to her?

1041
01:25:38,986 --> 01:25:41,475
Just nodded hello at one point.

1042
01:25:42,322 --> 01:25:44,847
Next time I looked up, she was gone.

1043
01:25:51,096 --> 01:25:52,563
But…

1044
01:25:52,764 --> 01:25:54,322
Jimmy…

1045
01:25:55,801 --> 01:25:57,733
she looked…

1046
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:00,561
happy.

1047
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,681
I got more walking to do.
Good night.

1048
01:26:32,599 --> 01:26:35,899
–You stole his car.
–His car was officially towed.

1049
01:26:36,003 --> 01:26:39,966
–From the front of his house.
–No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin…

1050
01:26:40,006 --> 01:26:41,590
adjacent to the parkway.

1051
01:26:41,675 --> 01:26:46,372
Lucky for us, the parkway's state
jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car…

1052
01:26:46,412 --> 01:26:49,973
they took it for a joy ride….
–What? Why'd you do it?

1053
01:26:50,148 --> 01:26:55,245
After I left you last night, I decided to talk
to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.

1054
01:26:55,285 --> 01:27:00,185
I get to his house, I decide to look in
his car, see what he's got. I find blood.

1055
01:27:00,225 --> 01:27:03,052
–Blood?
–Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.

1056
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:06,926
–How much?
–A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot more.

1057
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:09,963
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.

1058
01:27:10,133 --> 01:27:12,928
Wait, Katie Markum
never got in anybody's trunk.

1059
01:27:12,968 --> 01:27:15,865
She was chased through the park
where she died.

1060
01:27:15,905 --> 01:27:19,835
–It's enough to ask questions.
–Your search is gonna get tossed out.

1061
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:24,778
No, found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.

1062
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:29,243
–In the best interest of the owner.
–Get a physical search, file the report.

1063
01:27:29,283 --> 01:27:30,749
Bingo.

1064
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:34,382
You wanna talk to him,
or should I send him home?

1065
01:27:34,422 --> 01:27:37,584
–Dave's here?
–I've had him in the box for an hour.

1066
01:27:37,624 --> 01:27:41,320
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers
to pick him up.

1067
01:27:42,529 --> 01:27:43,790
Come on, Mr Boyle!

1068
01:27:43,963 --> 01:27:47,759
We know you didn't get that swollen hand
sticking it in the garbage disposal.

1069
01:27:47,799 --> 01:27:52,567
–Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
–Why's your wife afraid of you?

1070
01:27:53,104 --> 01:27:55,942
She know what really happened
to your hand?

1071
01:28:01,946 --> 01:28:04,845
How about a Sprite or something?

1072
01:28:05,015 --> 01:28:09,179
How about you tell us what really happened
Saturday night, Mr Boyle?

1073
01:28:09,219 --> 01:28:10,708
You lied.

1074
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,516
That's your opinion,
which you're entitled to.

1075
01:28:13,556 --> 01:28:18,458
–Hey, you think this is funny?
–No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.

1076
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:23,190
Not only was my car stolen last night,
but now you won't release it to me.

1077
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:24,823
Okay.

1078
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:27,994
All right.

1079
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:31,798
Tell us, Mr Boyle,
how did you get the blood in your car?

1080
01:28:31,838 --> 01:28:34,874
–What blood?
–Let's start with the front seat.

1081
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:38,521
What are you looking at him for?

1082
01:28:39,878 --> 01:28:43,542
Hey, you think I could get
that Sprite, Sean?

1083
01:28:44,317 --> 01:28:45,784
Sure.

1084
01:28:46,117 --> 01:28:48,110
Oh, I get it.

1085
01:28:48,753 --> 01:28:50,585
You're the good cop.

1086
01:28:51,089 --> 01:28:54,114
How about a meatball sub
while you're at it?

1087
01:28:54,325 --> 01:28:58,087
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.

1088
01:28:58,629 --> 01:29:01,995
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,
aren't you, Sean?

1089
01:29:04,101 --> 01:29:07,797
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.

1090
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:13,399
We got a chainlink fence
in our back yard.

1091
01:29:13,576 --> 01:29:17,372
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball
every afternoon after school.

1092
01:29:17,412 --> 01:29:21,709
He's getting good, so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence.

1093
01:29:21,749 --> 01:29:24,412
So I climb it.
Except I slip…

1094
01:29:24,585 --> 01:29:27,819
slice myself where the links curl in,
right here.

1095
01:29:27,955 --> 01:29:29,752
Bled like hell.

1096
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:33,655
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.

1097
01:29:34,028 --> 01:29:37,323
Probably was still bleeding
when I got in the front seat.

1098
01:29:37,363 --> 01:29:39,058
What blood type are you?

1099
01:29:39,732 --> 01:29:41,394
B-negative.

1100
01:29:41,668 --> 01:29:44,363
Yeah? That's the match we got.

1101
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:47,082
–Well, there you go.
–Not quite.

1102
01:29:47,206 --> 01:29:50,374
Blood in the trunk of the car
wasn't B-negative.

1103
01:29:51,076 --> 01:29:54,442
I don't know anything
about any blood in the trunk.

1104
01:29:54,546 --> 01:29:57,846
No idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk?

1105
01:29:57,915 --> 01:30:01,078
–None.
–This is not the way you wanna go, Dave.

1106
01:30:01,252 --> 01:30:03,100
How will that look in court?

1107
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:07,151
You not knowing how someone else's blood
got in the trunk of your car?

1108
01:30:07,191 --> 01:30:10,425
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.

1109
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:12,422
What report?

1110
01:30:12,795 --> 01:30:17,151
The stolen-car report.
The car wasn't in my possession last night.

1111
01:30:17,433 --> 01:30:20,661
So whatever the thieves used it for,
you should find out…

1112
01:30:20,701 --> 01:30:23,803
because it sounds like they
were up to no good.

1113
01:30:29,309 --> 01:30:32,768
Things looking any better
on the Sprite, Sean?

1114
01:30:33,046 --> 01:30:36,708
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.

1115
01:30:36,748 --> 01:30:39,545
Anything there, his lawyers say
was put by thieves.

1116
01:30:39,585 --> 01:30:42,314
–I can break him.
–He just kicked our asses!

1117
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,683
You still think Dave
wouldn't hurt a fly—

1118
01:30:44,723 --> 01:30:47,085
–Is that the point? No.
–What is the point?

1119
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:51,118
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.

1120
01:30:51,495 --> 01:30:53,861
Okay. Maybe.

1121
01:30:56,367 --> 01:30:58,215
So, what do we do with Dave?

1122
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:01,288
Fuck it. Kick him loose.

1123
01:31:02,105 --> 01:31:06,040
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.

1124
01:31:06,242 --> 01:31:09,507
Or this lovely red marble here.

1125
01:31:10,379 --> 01:31:12,141
Or a figural.

1126
01:31:12,314 --> 01:31:13,871
That one.

1127
01:31:14,383 --> 01:31:17,875
Very good. Nice and simple.

1128
01:31:26,393 --> 01:31:27,986
Hey, Jimmy!

1129
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:33,592
Annabeth said you were here.

1130
01:31:34,935 --> 01:31:37,196
We been asking around, like you said to.

1131
01:31:37,236 --> 01:31:38,760
–Yeah?
–Yeah.

1132
01:31:38,939 --> 01:31:42,268
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit
you did for me.

1133
01:31:42,308 --> 01:31:45,537
And it ain't about me missing your brains
running things.

1134
01:31:45,577 --> 01:31:50,109
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but
she was part of our family, we loved her.

1135
01:31:50,149 --> 01:31:52,707
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?

1136
01:31:54,118 --> 01:31:59,016
Cops are all over this. Doing their job
for once. Bars, street trade, everything.

1137
01:31:59,056 --> 01:32:02,653
Every hooker we talked to, bartender,
already been questioned.

1138
01:32:02,693 --> 01:32:06,689
–The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
–What about Just Ray's kid?

1139
01:32:06,729 --> 01:32:10,630
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.

1140
01:32:10,866 --> 01:32:14,166
I talked to Diane and Eve.
They said he loved her.

1141
01:32:14,303 --> 01:32:16,828
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.

1142
01:32:18,874 --> 01:32:21,341
–Want us to take a run at him?
–No.

1143
01:32:21,508 --> 01:32:25,206
Hold off for now.
Anything else?

1144
01:32:27,981 --> 01:32:29,471
What?

1145
01:32:32,652 --> 01:32:35,347
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.

1146
01:32:35,522 --> 01:32:37,045
Tell him.

1147
01:32:38,724 --> 01:32:41,888
Sean Devine and his partner
went by and saw Dave Boyle.

1148
01:32:41,928 --> 01:32:46,291
Dave was at McGill's. Probably
questioning him like everybody else.

1149
01:32:46,331 --> 01:32:48,760
I heard something else this morning too.

1150
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:53,618
–Two staties came by in uniform.
–Maybe they forgot to ask him something.

1151
01:32:54,105 --> 01:32:56,967
No. When they left,
they took him with them.

1152
01:32:57,007 --> 01:33:00,637
They put him in the back seat,
if you know what I mean.

1153
01:33:15,558 --> 01:33:19,322
“Raymond Matthew Harris,
born 9-6, 1957.

1154
01:33:19,494 --> 01:33:22,134
First child, Brendan Seamus, born 1983.”

1155
01:33:22,295 --> 01:33:27,047
Same year that Just Ray is indicted
in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.

1156
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,477
Charges are dropped, and he's fired.

1157
01:33:29,569 --> 01:33:33,767
Does odd jobs after that,
including clerking at Looney Liquors.

1158
01:33:33,974 --> 01:33:39,003
Questioned in that robbery. Questioned
in another, same year, Blanchard Liquors…

1159
01:33:39,043 --> 01:33:41,353
released on lack of evidence again.

1160
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:44,976
–Beginning to become known, though.
–He's getting popular.

1161
01:33:45,016 --> 01:33:48,580
“A known associate, one Edmund Reese,
fingers Raymond…

1162
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:52,315
in the 1985 heist
of a rare comic-book collection.”

1163
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:54,140
Comic books? You go, Ray.

1164
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:56,920
Hey, excuse me,
$150,000 worth of comic books.

1165
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,724
Oh, excuse me.

1166
01:33:58,896 --> 01:34:03,797
“Raymond returned said literature
unharmed.” Does a year solid inside.

1167
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,130
Comes out with a chemical-dependency
problem.

1168
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:09,797
Gets honest work
to support the habit, though?

1169
01:34:09,837 --> 01:34:11,737
Evidently not.

1170
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:16,173
Picked up in a joint
MCU-FBl sting operation…

1171
01:34:16,345 --> 01:34:20,942
trafficking stolen goods across
state lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.

1172
01:34:20,982 --> 01:34:23,945
–The boy's got style.
–Got a boatload of grief too.

1173
01:34:23,985 --> 01:34:28,648
Stole the truck in Rhode Island,
drove it into Massachusetts.

1174
01:34:28,822 --> 01:34:33,772
–Hence, the federal interstate rap.
–Hence, they got him by the balls, but…

1175
01:34:33,826 --> 01:34:35,488
he does no time.

1176
01:34:36,262 --> 01:34:39,824
–He rolled on someone.
–Looks that way. After that, he's clean.

1177
01:34:39,864 --> 01:34:44,329
–August 1989, he disappears.
–One, he's dead, two, in Witness Protection.

1178
01:34:44,369 --> 01:34:47,735
Three, he goes deep underground,
then pops back up…

1179
01:34:47,805 --> 01:34:51,536
to murder his son's 19-year-old girlfriend?
We got nothing.

1180
01:34:51,576 --> 01:34:56,305
A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years ago,
during which the murder weapon was used.

1181
01:34:56,345 --> 01:35:00,213
The guy's son dated the victim.
I say we got a lot.

1182
01:35:00,884 --> 01:35:03,380
Anything about Just Ray's
known associates?

1183
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:06,182
Let's take a look.
“Known criminal associates:

1184
01:35:06,222 --> 01:35:11,056
Reginald “Dukie” Neil, Kevin
“Whackjob” Sirraci, Nicholas Savage…

1185
01:35:11,726 --> 01:35:13,750
Anthony Waxman.”

1186
01:35:15,897 --> 01:35:17,693
And one James Markum.

1187
01:35:19,967 --> 01:35:22,367
And the hits just keep on coming.

1188
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:29,836
–You looking for me?
–I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.

1189
01:35:29,876 --> 01:35:31,936
I already gotta get back.

1190
01:35:32,312 --> 01:35:35,675
So you worked a task force
with Major Crimes in the '80s?

1191
01:35:35,715 --> 01:35:39,311
–Bunch of them.
–You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.

1192
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:44,049
He stole a truckload of cigarettes
from a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.

1193
01:35:44,089 --> 01:35:47,318
Trucker went to take a piss,
Harris guy jacks the truck.

1194
01:35:47,358 --> 01:35:51,321
–Think we pulled him over in New Bedford.
–But Harris walked.

1195
01:35:51,361 --> 01:35:53,353
He didn't walk, he rolled.

1196
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:57,894
Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in
for info on another case. He rolled.

1197
01:35:57,934 --> 01:35:59,492
On who?

1198
01:36:00,237 --> 01:36:02,295
What the fuck was the name?

1199
01:36:02,472 --> 01:36:06,569
Him and three other guys knocked over
the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.

1200
01:36:06,609 --> 01:36:08,372
Jimmy Markum.

1201
01:36:08,645 --> 01:36:13,478
Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.
Ran a crew, never got arrested.

1202
01:36:13,781 --> 01:36:16,511
So did Harris ever testify in open court?

1203
01:36:16,684 --> 01:36:20,447
Never went. Markum dummied up
on the guys he was working with…

1204
01:36:20,487 --> 01:36:24,384
DA was afraid he wouldn't be able
to convict. So he cut a deal.

1205
01:36:24,424 --> 01:36:26,753
Two years inside,
couple more suspended.

1206
01:36:26,793 --> 01:36:30,621
So Jimmy Markum never knew
that Ray Harris ratted him out?

1207
01:36:31,598 --> 01:36:34,238
Ray Harris disappeared
about two months…

1208
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:37,336
after Markum rotated back
into the free world.

1209
01:36:37,435 --> 01:36:39,096
What's that tell you?

1210
01:36:50,447 --> 01:36:53,075
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.

1211
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:56,116
–Hey, coz, how you doing?
–I'm good.

1212
01:36:56,286 --> 01:36:58,948
Okay. Hey.

1213
01:36:59,155 --> 01:37:01,646
–Hey, Celeste.
–Hey, Jimmy. Hey.

1214
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:06,215
–Can I talk to you for a sec?
–I'll catch up with you in a minute.

1215
01:37:08,664 --> 01:37:10,291
Step into my office.

1216
01:37:22,509 --> 01:37:23,875
Beautiful day, huh?

1217
01:37:32,051 --> 01:37:34,361
Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.

1218
01:37:39,959 --> 01:37:42,427
I took Michael last night…

1219
01:37:42,995 --> 01:37:44,689
and I went to a motel.

1220
01:37:46,897 --> 01:37:48,158
Okay.

1221
01:37:49,233 --> 01:37:51,063
I don't know, Jim.

1222
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:54,582
I might have left Dave for good.

1223
01:37:56,038 --> 01:37:57,870
You left Dave?

1224
01:38:01,144 --> 01:38:02,610
Yeah.

1225
01:38:03,845 --> 01:38:05,312
Well…

1226
01:38:06,949 --> 01:38:10,247
he's been acting kind of nuts lately.

1227
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:14,685
I'm almost afraid of him.

1228
01:38:18,925 --> 01:38:20,688
Do you know something?

1229
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:26,999
I know he was taken in by the cops
this morning.

1230
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:30,662
He saw Katie the night she was murdered.
Didn't tell me…

1231
01:38:30,702 --> 01:38:32,966
till after the cops questioned him.

1232
01:38:33,006 --> 01:38:37,824
I know he's got a hand that looks like
it's been punching a fucking wall.

1233
01:38:38,076 --> 01:38:40,518
Is there anything else I should know?

1234
01:38:48,184 --> 01:38:49,777
Come here.

1235
01:38:52,422 --> 01:38:53,912
Okay.

1236
01:38:54,992 --> 01:38:57,290
At 3 in the morning…

1237
01:38:57,594 --> 01:39:03,031
on Sunday, Dave came back to the
apartment covered in someone else's blood.

1238
01:39:06,902 --> 01:39:08,869
What did he say happened?

1239
01:39:10,538 --> 01:39:13,974
That he was mugged.
That he….

1240
01:39:14,143 --> 01:39:16,940
He bashed the mugger's head
in the street.

1241
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:18,373
That….

1242
01:39:18,545 --> 01:39:20,877
That he might have killed him.

1243
01:39:27,553 --> 01:39:30,578
But there was nothing in the paper.

1244
01:39:39,297 --> 01:39:42,266
–Celeste?
–Yeah?

1245
01:39:45,135 --> 01:39:46,625
–Celeste?
–Yeah?

1246
01:39:46,837 --> 01:39:48,304
Celeste?

1247
01:39:52,809 --> 01:39:55,209
Do you think Dave killed my Katie?

1248
01:40:00,249 --> 01:40:02,239
Okay. All right.

1249
01:40:02,418 --> 01:40:03,907
Okay.

1250
01:40:04,954 --> 01:40:06,784
Oh, God.

1251
01:40:13,027 --> 01:40:14,495
Okay.

1252
01:40:17,099 --> 01:40:19,089
Oh, my God.

1253
01:40:20,365 --> 01:40:23,336
–Tell me about your father, Brendan.
–What?

1254
01:40:23,536 --> 01:40:27,471
Your father, Ray Sr.
You remember him.

1255
01:40:27,773 --> 01:40:31,540
–I was 6 when he left us.
–So you don't remember the guy?

1256
01:40:32,612 --> 01:40:34,876
I remember little things.

1257
01:40:35,681 --> 01:40:38,376
He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.

1258
01:40:39,016 --> 01:40:40,507
He….

1259
01:40:41,152 --> 01:40:42,710
He what?

1260
01:40:43,688 --> 01:40:48,181
He carried a lot of change in his pocket.
It jingled when he walked.

1261
01:40:48,659 --> 01:40:51,022
You could always hear him coming home.

1262
01:40:51,062 --> 01:40:56,293
And if I guessed how much he had,
even if I was close, he'd give it to me.

1263
01:40:57,167 --> 01:40:59,675
You remember your father having a gun?

1264
01:41:00,102 --> 01:41:01,535
No.

1265
01:41:01,704 --> 01:41:06,164
Well, you seem awfully sure for somebody
who was 6 when he left.

1266
01:41:06,941 --> 01:41:08,465
What's up?

1267
01:41:08,644 --> 01:41:11,475
–What's that?
–This is what you asked for.

1268
01:41:11,646 --> 01:41:16,311
CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint analysis,
the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.

1269
01:41:16,351 --> 01:41:18,011
All right, thanks.

1270
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:21,359
We were talking about your father's gun.

1271
01:41:22,323 --> 01:41:27,759
–I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
–Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.

1272
01:41:28,594 --> 01:41:31,691
–When was the last time you talked to him?
–Never.

1273
01:41:31,731 --> 01:41:32,993
Never?

1274
01:41:33,166 --> 01:41:35,594
He went out for a drink
and never came back.

1275
01:41:35,634 --> 01:41:39,264
But your mother never filed
a missing person's report. Why not?

1276
01:41:39,304 --> 01:41:40,999
Because he's not missing.

1277
01:41:41,173 --> 01:41:44,040
–He sends money every month.
–Sends money?

1278
01:41:44,675 --> 01:41:48,635
Five hundred bucks every month.
Like clockwork.

1279
01:41:49,947 --> 01:41:52,847
–From where?
–Postmark says Brooklyn.

1280
01:41:54,416 --> 01:41:57,650
–How do you know it's him?
–Who else would it be?

1281
01:41:59,889 --> 01:42:01,879
Who else would send it?

1282
01:42:03,091 --> 01:42:05,269
My ma says that's the way he was.

1283
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:08,858
Do something shitty,
then he'd try to make up for it.

1284
01:42:11,899 --> 01:42:15,133
Why do you keep asking me
if my father had a gun?

1285
01:42:16,637 --> 01:42:18,103
You know why, kid.

1286
01:42:18,638 --> 01:42:19,935
No, I don't.

1287
01:42:20,874 --> 01:42:22,869
Gun that killed your girlfriend…

1288
01:42:22,909 --> 01:42:26,639
was the same gun your father used
in a robbery 18 years ago.

1289
01:42:26,679 --> 01:42:27,942
So…

1290
01:42:28,581 --> 01:42:30,548
you wanna tell me about it?

1291
01:42:33,586 --> 01:42:35,917
My father didn't have a gun.

1292
01:42:36,087 --> 01:42:38,077
You are fucking lying!

1293
01:42:44,428 --> 01:42:46,225
Can I go now?

1294
01:42:46,997 --> 01:42:50,099
Or are you gonna charge me
with Katie's murder?

1295
01:43:02,978 --> 01:43:06,641
Hey! Dandy Dave Boyle,
how's it hanging?

1296
01:43:07,616 --> 01:43:09,379
Hey, Val.

1297
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,980
Nick. How you guys holding up?

1298
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:14,746
–All right.
–It's fucked up.

1299
01:43:17,192 --> 01:43:18,681
Katie.

1300
01:43:20,093 --> 01:43:21,923
A fucking tragedy.

1301
01:43:23,097 --> 01:43:24,358
Yeah.

1302
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:27,526
We're gonna get a couple of beers
and a bite to eat.

1303
01:43:27,566 --> 01:43:28,827
Yeah?

1304
01:43:29,634 --> 01:43:31,865
Yeah. What do you say, man?

1305
01:43:32,037 --> 01:43:35,837
How about a boys' night out
in the middle of the day?

1306
01:43:38,509 --> 01:43:42,206
–I gotta get home after a while.
–Don't we all? Hop in.

1307
01:43:42,381 --> 01:43:44,295
–Come on, get in.
–All right.

1308
01:43:45,315 --> 01:43:48,479
Well, the first round's on me.

1309
01:43:50,153 --> 01:43:52,211
Now you're talking.

1310
01:44:10,772 --> 01:44:15,536
–I think the kid is lying about the gun.
–Absolutely. I told you three times already.

1311
01:44:15,576 --> 01:44:20,568
–What about the father?
–I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is still alive.

1312
01:44:20,947 --> 01:44:22,348
Eighty grand. I mean…

1313
01:44:22,516 --> 01:44:26,476
who else is gonna send
that kind of money if not the father?

1314
01:44:27,218 --> 01:44:30,848
Listen, go home, have a drink.

1315
01:44:31,024 --> 01:44:34,458
–Let it go for a while.
–Yeah.

1316
01:44:34,626 --> 01:44:36,958
Hey, anything good on the 911?

1317
01:44:37,128 --> 01:44:41,154
–I thought you listened to it.
–I thought you listened to it.

1318
01:44:45,034 --> 01:44:48,365
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

1319
01:44:48,405 --> 01:44:51,735
There's, like, this car with blood in it,
and the door's open.

1320
01:44:51,775 --> 01:44:54,835
–What's the location of the car?
–Sydney Street.

1321
01:44:54,875 --> 01:44:58,775
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend, we just found it.

1322
01:44:58,815 --> 01:45:01,777
–Son, what's your name?
–He wants to know her name.

1323
01:45:01,817 --> 01:45:05,013
–Your name, what's your name?
–We're so fucking out of here.

1324
01:45:05,053 --> 01:45:06,953
Good luck, man.

1325
01:45:07,221 --> 01:45:11,385
That about cracks the case, don't it?
Let's get a burger or something.

1326
01:45:11,425 --> 01:45:12,914
Her.

1327
01:45:13,662 --> 01:45:17,028
–What?
–The kid on the tape.

1328
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:24,530
–Son, what's your name?
–He wants to know her name.

1329
01:45:24,570 --> 01:45:28,800
–He said, “Her name.”
–She's a dead girl, you refer to her as a she.

1330
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,570
How does the kid know?
Girl's dead in the park.

1331
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:35,306
How does he know the blood in the car
came from a woman?

1332
01:45:39,617 --> 01:45:40,948
Play it again.

1333
01:45:47,256 --> 01:45:50,921
This one time, we're going
to take down this stamp collector.

1334
01:45:50,961 --> 01:45:53,355
–Tie him up, rob him, we're out.
–Here.

1335
01:45:53,395 --> 01:45:57,891
It was me, Nicky and this kid
Carson Leverett.

1336
01:45:58,066 --> 01:45:59,557
Fucking Carson.

1337
01:45:59,734 --> 01:46:03,998
I swear, this kid couldn't tie his own
fucking shoe if you didn't show him.

1338
01:46:04,038 --> 01:46:06,601
We all wear suits
because we want to fit in.

1339
01:46:06,641 --> 01:46:12,271
We're in the elevator, it stops, this old
lady gets on. She starts fucking screaming!

1340
01:46:14,348 --> 01:46:17,110
Now Val turns to me,
but I'm looking at Carson.

1341
01:46:17,150 --> 01:46:19,142
I'm thinking, “What the fuck?”

1342
01:46:19,353 --> 01:46:24,619
Because that fucking bonehead's
still got his Ronald Reagan mask on!

1343
01:46:24,824 --> 01:46:26,553
Fucking smiley mask!

1344
01:46:29,027 --> 01:46:30,494
Idiot!

1345
01:46:30,696 --> 01:46:33,164
And you guys didn't notice till then?

1346
01:46:35,066 --> 01:46:39,530
Shit like that happened all the time on jobs.
That's why Jimmy was so missed.

1347
01:46:39,570 --> 01:46:42,474
He saw shit happen
before it even went down.

1348
01:46:44,908 --> 01:46:47,152
Why do you think he went straight?

1349
01:46:49,678 --> 01:46:52,113
One word, pure and simple. Katie.

1350
01:46:54,583 --> 01:46:56,414
What about you guys?

1351
01:46:57,653 --> 01:47:01,452
What? Us? Going straight?

1352
01:47:02,890 --> 01:47:05,324
That's pretty fucking funny!

1353
01:47:09,096 --> 01:47:13,895
We're like bats, we like the night too much.
Days are just good for sleeping through.

1354
01:47:13,935 --> 01:47:15,594
Want another shot?

1355
01:47:19,205 --> 01:47:24,570
–You know, I should slow down till we eat.
–Come on, don't go fucking pussy on us!

1356
01:47:24,610 --> 01:47:26,043
Come on, get up.

1357
01:47:31,316 --> 01:47:33,283
Live a little, huh?

1358
01:48:00,742 --> 01:48:02,641
Slide over, Dave.

1359
01:48:04,145 --> 01:48:07,205
–Dave.
–All right, Val! Now you're talking.

1360
01:48:07,414 --> 01:48:10,849
–How you doing?
–I'm a little drunk.

1361
01:48:13,554 --> 01:48:15,350
To our children.

1362
01:48:20,192 --> 01:48:22,304
–I always liked this bar.
–Yeah.

1363
01:48:23,562 --> 01:48:25,621
Yeah, nobody bothers you.

1364
01:48:25,797 --> 01:48:28,993
The way it should be,
nobody to bother you in this life.

1365
01:48:29,033 --> 01:48:32,729
No one fucking with you
or your loved ones. Right, Dave?

1366
01:48:32,803 --> 01:48:35,328
–Absolutely.
–Absolutely.

1367
01:48:35,541 --> 01:48:38,269
This guy's a hoot.
He can really get you going.

1368
01:48:38,309 --> 01:48:39,605
Yeah.

1369
01:48:39,810 --> 01:48:41,539
Oh, yeah, my man Dave.

1370
01:48:47,450 --> 01:48:49,694
Kevin, will you bring us a bottle?

1371
01:49:00,595 --> 01:49:03,358
–Drink up, Dave.
–Come on.

1372
01:49:04,065 --> 01:49:05,725
Thanks, Kevin.

1373
01:49:41,932 --> 01:49:44,957
Remember we took Ray Harris here
that time?

1374
01:49:45,168 --> 01:49:50,538
Everybody called this guy “Just Ray,”
but Val here called him “Ray Jingles.”

1375
01:49:52,975 --> 01:49:55,872
This guy walked around
with 10 bucks in change…

1376
01:49:55,912 --> 01:49:59,007
in case he had to make a call
to Iraq or something.

1377
01:49:59,047 --> 01:50:01,027
Are you all right, Dave? Dave?

1378
01:50:01,415 --> 01:50:04,283
–You all right?
–Shit. I'm gonna be sick.

1379
01:50:04,452 --> 01:50:05,942
Come on. Come on, now.

1380
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:11,147
Dave, use the back door. Huey
don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims.

1381
01:50:34,279 --> 01:50:35,677
Hey, Ray.

1382
01:50:48,892 --> 01:50:51,796
You guys come to make sure
I didn't fall in?

1383
01:50:56,598 --> 01:50:58,395
Come here a second.

1384
01:51:03,905 --> 01:51:05,463
Sit down.

1385
01:51:14,781 --> 01:51:17,409
Let me tell you about Ray Harris.

1386
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:21,481
He was a buddy of mine.
He used to visit me in prison.

1387
01:51:22,155 --> 01:51:26,989
He checked in on Marita and Katie,
my mother, if they needed anything.

1388
01:51:27,158 --> 01:51:29,888
He's also the one who put me in.
He ratted me out.

1389
01:51:29,928 --> 01:51:32,657
–That's terrible.
–My wife had cancer at the time.

1390
01:51:32,697 --> 01:51:35,326
–I remember.
–Ray robbed me of being with her…

1391
01:51:35,366 --> 01:51:36,627
when she was dying.

1392
01:51:36,801 --> 01:51:41,164
The death part you do alone,
but I could have helped her with the dying.

1393
01:51:41,204 --> 01:51:43,262
Why are you telling me this?

1394
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:47,770
I knelt Ray down over there and
I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.

1395
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:50,372
–We were both crying when I did it.
–Jimmy—

1396
01:51:50,412 --> 01:51:51,970
He was begging.

1397
01:51:52,181 --> 01:51:54,876
You know, pregnant wife, little Brendan.

1398
01:51:55,884 --> 01:51:59,511
He said he knew me.
He said I was a good man.

1399
01:52:00,321 --> 01:52:03,621
What do you think, Dave?
You think I'm a good man?

1400
01:52:03,958 --> 01:52:05,391
Who do you hate?

1401
01:52:07,662 --> 01:52:09,220
Come on, who?

1402
01:52:09,395 --> 01:52:10,885
No one.

1403
01:52:13,134 --> 01:52:17,898
–What is it you think I did?
–As I was holding him under the water…

1404
01:52:18,070 --> 01:52:21,701
I could feel God watching me,
shaking his head. Not angry…

1405
01:52:21,741 --> 01:52:24,140
but like if a puppy shit on a rug.

1406
01:52:24,609 --> 01:52:26,100
Who do you love?

1407
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:32,376
You love me.

1408
01:52:34,585 --> 01:52:35,984
What about Ma?

1409
01:52:41,225 --> 01:52:44,819
You love me so much,
I wanna hear you say it.

1410
01:52:47,797 --> 01:52:52,060
–You think I killed Katie, don't you?
–Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.

1411
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:55,136
No, I killed someone,
but I didn't kill Katie.

1412
01:52:55,271 --> 01:52:56,998
This is the mugger story.

1413
01:52:57,172 --> 01:53:01,835
He wasn't a mugger, a child molester.
He was having sex with this kid in his car.

1414
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:05,675
He was a fucking wolf!
He was a vampire!

1415
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:15,049
Get out of here.

1416
01:53:27,832 --> 01:53:29,232
Run!

1417
01:53:29,868 --> 01:53:31,459
Dave, run!

1418
01:53:33,638 --> 01:53:37,466
–You killed a child molester.
–Yeah. Well, me and the boy.

1419
01:53:38,242 --> 01:53:41,176
–The molested boy helped you.
–Oh, no. No—

1420
01:53:41,344 --> 01:53:45,973
–You just said you and the boy!
–No, forget that!

1421
01:53:46,149 --> 01:53:51,165
–My head gets fucked up sometimes.
–Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.

1422
01:53:51,953 --> 01:53:55,417
Rather have her think that
than you killed a child molester?

1423
01:53:55,457 --> 01:53:59,087
People don't care if a child molester dies.
Why not tell the truth?

1424
01:53:59,127 --> 01:54:03,529
I don't know. Maybe I thought
I was turning into him.

1425
01:54:03,698 --> 01:54:05,927
I didn't kill Katie.

1426
01:54:06,733 --> 01:54:10,996
I don't remember hearing anything about
any guy's body being found.

1427
01:54:11,036 --> 01:54:15,401
–I put him in the trunk of my car.
–Letting this piece of shit explain himself?

1428
01:54:15,441 --> 01:54:18,569
–Fuck him. Fuck him! Do him!
–I didn't kill her!

1429
01:54:18,609 --> 01:54:22,570
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Everybody shut up!

1430
01:54:22,782 --> 01:54:26,341
This is my daughter I'm talking about!
Shut up!

1431
01:54:26,517 --> 01:54:27,848
–Fuck!
–Shut up!

1432
01:54:32,122 --> 01:54:33,419
Nineteen years old.

1433
01:54:33,591 --> 01:54:36,185
–I didn't kill Katie!
–Nineteen years old!

1434
01:54:36,225 --> 01:54:39,389
–Look at me, Jimmy!
–I'm looking at you, Dave.

1435
01:54:39,562 --> 01:54:40,960
I'm looking at you.

1436
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:43,826
Why'd you do it?

1437
01:54:44,032 --> 01:54:49,264
Me and my son. Me and Celeste. There's
so many things we gotta make right.

1438
01:54:49,438 --> 01:54:52,434
Make it right now. Start now.
Admit what you did.

1439
01:54:52,474 --> 01:54:55,204
No more lies, no more secrets.

1440
01:54:55,378 --> 01:54:58,612
I wanna go home to Celeste.
I wanna feel Celeste.

1441
01:54:58,913 --> 01:55:03,863
Right after you do your time. I did mine,
you do yours. Admit what you did.

1442
01:55:04,118 --> 01:55:07,314
–The boy….
–One more time about the boy…

1443
01:55:07,487 --> 01:55:09,599
and I will open you the fuck up.

1444
01:55:15,294 --> 01:55:18,091
I thought I was finished with all this.

1445
01:55:18,496 --> 01:55:21,994
I mean, killing people
and dumping them in the river.

1446
01:55:27,272 --> 01:55:31,034
You admit what you did, Dave,
and I'm gonna let you live.

1447
01:55:31,209 --> 01:55:35,269
Just say it out loud, and I'll let you breathe.

1448
01:55:35,879 --> 01:55:39,542
Admit what you did,
and I will give you your life.

1449
01:55:39,716 --> 01:55:41,649
Admit what you did, Dave.

1450
01:55:41,818 --> 01:55:44,080
Admit what you did.

1451
01:55:45,755 --> 01:55:48,746
Admit what you did.
Admit what you did.

1452
01:55:49,625 --> 01:55:51,148
I know you can speak.

1453
01:55:54,328 --> 01:55:57,924
So say it. Say you love me.

1454
01:56:01,302 --> 01:56:05,790
Don't look at him, look at me.
Now, you say it. You say you love me.

1455
01:56:12,812 --> 01:56:16,640
–He never does anything without you!
–No, let me go! Stop!

1456
01:56:23,988 --> 01:56:25,546
I'm coming back!

1457
01:56:31,595 --> 01:56:35,125
You love me so much,
you gotta kill my fucking girlfriend, huh?

1458
01:56:35,165 --> 01:56:39,933
Speak, you fucking freak,
or I will fucking kill you!

1459
01:56:40,136 --> 01:56:42,433
Say her name. Say it.

1460
01:56:42,906 --> 01:56:47,740
Say it! Katie!
Say it or you die!

1461
01:56:58,353 --> 01:57:02,812
Kid, you want to point that
toward the floor, okay?

1462
01:57:03,524 --> 01:57:05,185
That's a Sig, right?

1463
01:57:07,527 --> 01:57:09,756
Don't you want to draw it on me?

1464
01:57:10,696 --> 01:57:13,164
No, I don't want to hurt a kid.

1465
01:57:13,432 --> 01:57:16,600
Plus, it looks like somebody else
beat me to it.

1466
01:57:17,302 --> 01:57:20,295
Brendan, man, he fucking punched me.

1467
01:57:21,172 --> 01:57:24,107
–He broke my nose.
–We'll arrest him.

1468
01:57:24,275 --> 01:57:28,367
–Haul his ass to jail if you like.
–I don't want him arrested.

1469
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:30,375
I want him fucking dead!

1470
01:57:37,788 --> 01:57:39,982
Motherfucker.

1471
01:57:41,157 --> 01:57:43,090
Motherfucker.

1472
01:57:45,393 --> 01:57:48,296
Admit what you did, Dave…

1473
01:57:49,398 --> 01:57:51,389
and I'll let you live.

1474
01:57:51,565 --> 01:57:55,763
Just say it out loud, and I'll let you breathe.

1475
01:57:56,137 --> 01:57:58,298
You'll go to prison…

1476
01:57:59,407 --> 01:58:02,808
but I'll give you your life.
Admit it, Dave.

1477
01:58:02,978 --> 01:58:06,036
Admit what you did. Admit it.

1478
01:58:11,016 --> 01:58:12,678
Yeah.

1479
01:58:14,853 --> 01:58:16,753
Yeah, I did it.

1480
01:58:20,225 --> 01:58:21,852
Why?

1481
01:58:22,026 --> 01:58:23,493
Why?

1482
01:58:26,664 --> 01:58:30,963
That night in McGill's…

1483
01:58:31,968 --> 01:58:36,564
she reminded me of a dream I had.

1484
01:58:37,807 --> 01:58:39,206
What dream?

1485
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:43,177
A dream of youth.

1486
01:58:45,514 --> 01:58:48,074
I don't remember having one.

1487
01:58:50,552 --> 01:58:52,542
So it was the dream?

1488
01:58:54,223 --> 01:58:56,656
The dream, yeah.

1489
01:58:57,859 --> 01:59:03,228
You'd know what I mean
if you'd got in that car instead of me.

1490
01:59:09,869 --> 01:59:12,770
But I didn't get in that car, Dave.

1491
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,973
Hang on. Come here. You did.

1492
01:59:38,393 --> 01:59:40,759
We bury our sins here, Dave.

1493
01:59:43,765 --> 01:59:46,132
We wash them clean.

1494
01:59:48,402 --> 01:59:52,668
–Look, his fucking lips are still moving.
–I got eyes, Val.

1495
01:59:59,113 --> 02:00:01,136
I wasn't ready.

1496
02:00:07,153 --> 02:00:08,671
It's like I said, Dave.

1497
02:00:11,791 --> 02:00:13,520
This part, you do alone.

1498
02:00:58,499 --> 02:01:00,363
Tough night?

1499
02:01:03,137 --> 02:01:05,128
Yeah, me too.

1500
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:10,039
Saw a bullet with my name on it.

1501
02:01:18,683 --> 02:01:20,447
We got them, Jim.

1502
02:01:24,222 --> 02:01:25,552
Got who?

1503
02:01:26,156 --> 02:01:28,285
Katie's killers. Got them cold.

1504
02:01:32,896 --> 02:01:35,728
Killers, plural.

1505
02:01:36,532 --> 02:01:41,867
Yeah, kids, actually. Ray Harris' son
Ray Jr and another kid, John O'Shea.

1506
02:01:42,037 --> 02:01:44,611
They just confessed a couple hours ago.

1507
02:01:49,110 --> 02:01:50,509
No doubt?

1508
02:01:51,245 --> 02:01:52,974
None.

1509
02:02:02,289 --> 02:02:03,755
Why?

1510
02:02:05,358 --> 02:02:07,087
They don't know.

1511
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:09,920
They were playing with a gun,
saw a car coming…

1512
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:15,108
one of the kids lies down in the street,
car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie.

1513
02:02:16,768 --> 02:02:20,799
O'Shea says they just meant to scare her
and the gun went off.

1514
02:02:20,839 --> 02:02:24,240
But she hit him with her door, ran…

1515
02:02:24,408 --> 02:02:28,367
and they chased her
so she wouldn't tell anyone.

1516
02:02:36,285 --> 02:02:38,265
And the beating they gave her?

1517
02:02:40,689 --> 02:02:42,405
Ray Jr had a hockey stick.

1518
02:02:45,527 --> 02:02:47,757
All right. Go easy.

1519
02:02:47,930 --> 02:02:49,863
Take a breath.

1520
02:02:51,232 --> 02:02:53,062
Look at me.

1521
02:02:53,333 --> 02:02:55,268
Look at me, Jimmy.

1522
02:02:57,604 --> 02:02:59,936
I got a call from Celeste Boyle.

1523
02:03:00,105 --> 02:03:04,923
She was hysterical. Says Dave's missing,
says you might know where he is.

1524
02:03:05,445 --> 02:03:07,674
We need to talk to him.

1525
02:03:08,047 --> 02:03:12,450
Boston PD found the body of a guy
in the woods behind McGill's.

1526
02:03:12,618 --> 02:03:15,052
A body? The body of a guy?

1527
02:03:15,687 --> 02:03:18,815
Yeah, a pedophile with three priors.

1528
02:03:19,089 --> 02:03:21,923
They want to talk to Dave about it.

1529
02:03:22,459 --> 02:03:24,484
So, Jimmy…

1530
02:03:25,462 --> 02:03:28,057
when was the last time you saw Dave?

1531
02:03:38,808 --> 02:03:41,970
The last time I saw Dave.

1532
02:03:43,545 --> 02:03:46,775
Yeah. Dave Boyle.

1533
02:03:55,055 --> 02:03:59,423
–Dave Boyle.
–Yeah, Jimmy. Dave Boyle.

1534
02:04:02,062 --> 02:04:06,861
That was 25 years ago,
going up this street in the back of that car.

1535
02:04:16,073 --> 02:04:20,032
Jimmy, what did you do?

1536
02:04:28,185 --> 02:04:31,287
Thanks for finding
my daughter's killers, Sean.

1537
02:04:34,890 --> 02:04:37,382
If only you'd been a little faster.

1538
02:04:45,701 --> 02:04:49,363
Are you gonna send Celeste Boyle
500 a month too?

1539
02:04:56,009 --> 02:04:58,603
Sometimes I think….

1540
02:04:59,579 --> 02:05:02,548
I think all three of us got in that car.

1541
02:05:03,383 --> 02:05:07,647
And all of this is just a dream, you know?

1542
02:05:07,820 --> 02:05:09,980
A dream, sure.

1543
02:05:11,389 --> 02:05:13,585
In reality…

1544
02:05:13,792 --> 02:05:18,455
we're still 11-year-old boys
locked in a cellar…

1545
02:05:18,662 --> 02:05:22,424
imagining what our lives would have been
if we'd escaped.

1546
02:05:30,374 --> 02:05:32,466
Maybe you're right.

1547
02:05:32,642 --> 02:05:34,939
Who the fuck knows?

1548
02:06:03,369 --> 02:06:05,529
Yeah, this is Sean.

1549
02:06:11,443 --> 02:06:14,468
I'm sorry. I need you to know that.

1550
02:06:14,645 --> 02:06:16,909
I pushed you away.

1551
02:06:19,717 --> 02:06:22,116
I'm sorry too.

1552
02:06:23,086 --> 02:06:25,884
Things have been so messed up.

1553
02:06:26,055 --> 02:06:28,616
Loving you, hating you.

1554
02:06:30,826 --> 02:06:32,488
Come home?

1555
02:06:35,263 --> 02:06:37,441
You change the locks or anything?

1556
02:06:38,333 --> 02:06:40,096
No.

1557
02:06:41,070 --> 02:06:44,196
No, everything is just the way you left it.

1558
02:06:45,373 --> 02:06:48,137
–Nora.
–What's that?

1559
02:06:49,409 --> 02:06:53,072
Nora. That's our daughter's name, Sean.

1560
02:06:54,249 --> 02:06:55,942
Nora, huh?

1561
02:06:56,150 --> 02:07:00,108
Well, I like that. Nora.

1562
02:07:29,979 --> 02:07:32,276
I killed Dave.

1563
02:07:33,048 --> 02:07:36,177
I killed him, and I threw him in the Mystic.

1564
02:07:37,219 --> 02:07:39,118
But I killed the wrong man.

1565
02:07:39,787 --> 02:07:42,085
That's what I've done.

1566
02:07:42,724 --> 02:07:45,123
And I can't undo it.

1567
02:07:46,127 --> 02:07:47,958
Jimmy.

1568
02:07:55,802 --> 02:07:58,634
I wanna feel your heart.

1569
02:07:59,438 --> 02:08:00,735
Last night…

1570
02:08:01,208 --> 02:08:05,432
when I put the girls to bed,
I told them how big your heart was.

1571
02:08:05,511 --> 02:08:08,745
–I told them how much you loved Katie…
–Annabeth.

1572
02:08:08,781 --> 02:08:10,476
because you created her.

1573
02:08:10,648 --> 02:08:14,482
And sometimes,
your love for her was so big…

1574
02:08:14,651 --> 02:08:18,450
felt like your heart was gonna explode—
–Please stop.

1575
02:08:18,623 --> 02:08:22,456
I told them their daddy
loved them that much too.

1576
02:08:22,626 --> 02:08:26,124
That he had four hearts,
and they were all filled up…

1577
02:08:26,295 --> 02:08:30,393
and aching with a love that meant
we would never have to worry.

1578
02:08:30,433 --> 02:08:36,463
And that their daddy would do
whatever he had to for those he loved.

1579
02:08:36,671 --> 02:08:39,867
And that is never wrong.

1580
02:08:40,041 --> 02:08:45,980
That can never be wrong,
no matter what their daddy had to do.

1581
02:08:46,146 --> 02:08:50,844
And those girls fell asleep at peace.

1582
02:08:59,358 --> 02:09:03,853
You said, “Last night.” You knew?

1583
02:09:04,931 --> 02:09:07,159
Celeste called, looking for you.

1584
02:09:07,332 --> 02:09:10,796
She was worried something might happen.
She told me about Dave.

1585
02:09:10,836 --> 02:09:13,764
Told me what she told you.
What kind of wife…

1586
02:09:13,804 --> 02:09:17,067
says that about her husband?
And why'd she run to you?

1587
02:09:17,107 --> 02:09:21,305
–Why didn't you call?
–Because it's like I told the girls.

1588
02:09:21,711 --> 02:09:23,975
Their daddy's a king.

1589
02:09:24,147 --> 02:09:28,379
And a king knows what to do and does it.

1590
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:30,109
Even when it's hard.

1591
02:09:30,286 --> 02:09:34,689
And their daddy will do
whatever he has to for those he loves.

1592
02:09:34,857 --> 02:09:37,654
And that's all that matters.

1593
02:09:42,563 --> 02:09:46,192
Because everyone is weak, Jimmy.

1594
02:09:46,401 --> 02:09:48,698
Everyone but us.

1595
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:50,996
We will never be weak.

1596
02:09:51,204 --> 02:09:53,332
And you….

1597
02:09:54,275 --> 02:09:56,935
You could rule this town.

1598
02:10:00,746 --> 02:10:03,375
And after, Jimmy…

1599
02:10:03,548 --> 02:10:06,279
let's take the girls down to the parade.

1600
02:10:06,451 --> 02:10:09,215
Katie would have liked that.

1601
02:11:46,240 --> 02:11:48,173
Michael!

1602
02:11:48,843 --> 02:11:53,040
Michael! Michael!

1603
02:11:54,347 --> 02:11:56,338
Michael!

1604
02:11:56,949 --> 02:11:58,881
Michael!
