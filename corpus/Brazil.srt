<i>We do the work, you do the pleasure</i>

3
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,277
<i>Hi, there. I want to talk to you about ducts.</i>

4
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:17,822
<i>Do your ducts seem old-fashioned,</i>

5
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:19,741
<i>out-of-date?</i>

6
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:22,953
<i>Central Services' new duct designs</i>

7
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:26,373
<i>are now available</i>
<i>in hundreds of different colors</i>

8
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:28,833
<i>to suit your individual taste.</i>

9
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:34,297
<i>Hurry now, while stocks last, to your</i>
<i>nearest Central Services showroom.</i>

10
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,094
<i>Designer colors</i>
<i>to suit your demanding taste.</i>

11
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:02,534
<i>We have with us</i>
<i>from the Ministry of Information</i>

12
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:05,412
<i>Deputy Minister, Eugene Helpmann.</i>

13
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:07,497
<i>Good evening, David.</i>

14
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:12,002
<i>What do you believe is behind</i>
<i>this recent increase in terrorist bombings?</i>

15
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:14,004
<i>Bad sportsmanship.</i>

16
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,506
<i>A ruthless minority of people</i>

17
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,468
<i>seems to have forgotten</i>
<i>certain good old-fashioned virtues.</i>

18
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:24,180
<i>They just can't stand seeing</i>
<i>the other fellow win.</i>

19
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:26,808
<i>If these people would just play the game</i>

20
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:28,893
<i>they'd get a lot more out of life.</i>

21
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:31,896
<i>Nevertheless, Mr. Helpmann,</i>
<i>there are those who maintain</i>

22
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:35,692
<i>that the Ministry of Information</i>
<i>has become too large and unwieldy.</i>

23
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:38,486
<i>In free society,</i>
<i>information is the name of the game.</i>

24
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:41,323
<i>You can't win the game</i>
<i>if you're a man short.</i>

25
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:45,869
<i>The cost of it all, seven percent</i>
<i>of the gross national product.</i>

26
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:49,414
<i>I understand this concern</i>
<i>on behalf of the taxpayers.</i>

27
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:52,876
<i>People want value for money.</i>
<i>That is why we always insist</i>

28
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,504
<i>on the principle</i>
<i>of Information Retrieval Charges.</i>

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,758
<i>It's absolutely right and fair</i>

30
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:03,261
<i>that those found guilty</i>
<i>should pay for their periods of detention</i>

31
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:08,224
<i>and for the information retrieval</i>
<i>procedures used in their interrogation.</i>

32
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:11,895
<i>Do you believe that the government</i>
<i>is winning against terrorists?</i>

33
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,313
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

34
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,818
<i>We're fielding all their strokes,</i>
<i>running all of them out</i>

35
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:21,780
<i>and pretty consistently</i>
<i>knocking them for six.</i>

36
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:26,493
<i>I'd say they're nearly out of the game.</i>

37
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:42,050
<i>Mr. Helpmann, the bombing campaign</i>
<i>is now in its 13th year.</i>

38
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,469
<i>Beginner's luck.</i>

39
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:47,597
<i>Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.</i>

40
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,227
<i>Thank you, David.</i>
<i>And a very merry Christmas to you all.</i>

"Scrooge was better than his word.

42
00:03:57,274 --> 00:04:00,235

<i>Are you boys giving me the runaround?</i>

49
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:26,845
<i>Now, I have to say, "Hey, hey."</i>

50
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,848
<i>Don't throw that.</i>
<i>That's only for long distance.</i>

51
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:33,852
<i>- I'm sorry, we haven't got any vacancies.</i>
<i>- No vacancies?</i>

52
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:35,353
<i>We've got plenty of rooms.</i>

53
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:49,117
Who's there?

54
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:53,746
Who is that?

Father Christmas can't come

Press harder this time. Good.

69
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:31,553
What is this all about?

70
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:35,265
That is your receipt for your husband.
Thank you.

71

This is my receipt for your receipt.

72
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,811
Mrs. Buttle, are you okay?

73
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:47,318
We're Department of Works!
Department of Works up here.

74
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:51,072
- Careful with those bloody things.
- Sure.

75
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:53,575
Don't take any notice of them.

76
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,077
Don't touch me!
Why don't you just get out of here.

77
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:59,163
Don't you worry.
We'll have everything shipshape in a jiffy.

78
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:00,832
Nothing to worry about.

79
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,501
It's Tuttle downstairs who can worry.

80
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:06,838
Tuttle? His name's Buttle.
There must be some mistake.

81
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:10,049
Mistake? We don't make mistakes.

82
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:17,056
Bloody typical. They've gone back
to metric without telling us.

83
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,517
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

84
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:20,893
Yes...

85
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:53,111
Buttle.

86
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:58,449
Buttle, Archibald.

87
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,626
Oh, shit!

88
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,296
Mister...

89
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:17,885
Mr. Lowry, would you step in here, please.

90
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,340
Has anybody seen Lowry?

91
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:02,138
Has anybody seen

92
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:04,140
Sam Lowry?

93
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:41,385
Sam.

94
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:20,341
<i>Hello? Sam. Where are you?</i>

95
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:21,676
- Hello?
<i>- It's 11:00.</i>

96
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:24,679
- What?
<i>- It's 11:00.</i>

97
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,514
Mr. Kurtzmann.

98
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:29,934
You're up late.

99
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:32,019
Is it?

100
00:11:37,526 --> 00:11:40,820
- The electrics here are up the spout.
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

101
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,446
- Yours, too?
- Yes.

102
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:46,993
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Yes, thanks. 'Bye.

103
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:51,515
This is not the only statue.

104
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:55,102
What's this gun for?

105
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:58,773
This one, Sister,
is a nine millimeter submachine gun

106
00:12:58,857 --> 00:13:02,485
used for close-quarter combat fighting.
Very effective weapon.

107
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:03,569
Would you like to see it?

108
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:35,476
Sam!

109
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,479
Jack!

110
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:42,566
Long time no see.

111
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:45,361
What are you doing here?

112
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:47,947
Didn't expect to see you
slumming it in Records.

113
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:50,157
- What's the problem?
- Problem? No problem.

114
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:51,826
Everything's fine. Marvelous.

115
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,413
Alison's in great shape, kids are fine.
I'm on Security Level 5

116
00:13:55,497 --> 00:13:58,708
so Mr. Helpmann relies on me
more and more. It's been a great year.

117
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:00,418
You sound worried.

118
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:03,504
Worried? Me?
If I'm worried about anyone, Sam, it's you.

119
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:06,924
Sam, whatever happened to you?

120
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:08,759
Records.

121
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:22,273
Sam?

122
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:28,195
Jack, it's great to see you.
I'm going to be late.

123
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:31,657
Sam, let a friend tell you
your life is going wrong.

124
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:35,077
Records is a dead-end department.
No security that's worth a damn.

125
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:38,497
- It's impossible to get noticed.
- I know. Wonderful.

126
00:14:38,623 --> 00:14:40,958
Marvelous. Perfect.

127
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:44,253
See you, Jack.
Give my regards to Alison and the twins.

128
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:46,213
- Triplets.
- Triplets?

129
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:49,091
God, how time flies.

130
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:54,638
A very clear delineation of picture, is it not?
Mobile.

131
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,307
Next!

132
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:03,814
I want to report a wrongful arrest.

133
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,276
You want Information Adjustments.
Different department.

134
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,404
I've been to Information Adjustments.
They sent me here.

135
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:12,531
They said you have a form I need to fill out.

136
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:16,035
- Have you got an arrest receipt?
- Yeah.

137
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:19,163
Is it stamped?

138
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:21,332
Stamped?

139
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:26,003
No, there's no stamp on it, you see.

140
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,840
I can't let you have the form
until this is stamped.

141
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:31,217
Where do I get it stamped?

142
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,844
Information Adjustments.

143
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:47,858
It's nothing.

144
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:54,490
It keeps picking up old films.
That can't be right, can it?

145
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:57,284
Perhaps the machine's on the blink.

146
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:58,410
No, it's not the machine.

147
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:00,788
There's a mismatch
on the personnel code numbers.

148
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:05,709
Tuttle should've had £31.06
debited against his account, not Buttle.

149
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:08,712
- My God, a mistake!
- At least it's not ours.

150
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:11,006
Isn't it? Whose is it?

151
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:13,592
- Information Retrieval.
- Good.

152
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:16,971
Expediting has put in
for electrical procedures in respect of

153
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:19,849
Buttle, Archibald, shoe-repair operative.

154
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:24,103
But Security has invoiced Admin.
for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer.

155
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:27,231
What a relief. Well, finish your tea, Sam.

156
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:29,733
Thanks.

157
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:33,821
I don't know what I'd do
if you ever got promoted.

158
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:37,950
- God, don't worry about that.
- But if they did promote you.

159
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:42,037
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.

160
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:44,373
- Would you, really?
- Really.

161
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:46,584
You've been promoted.

162
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:54,592
It's your mother, isn't it?
Pulling strings again.

163
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:03,100
Sam, it's time for you to grow up
and accept responsibility.

164
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:07,271
Your poor father would be appalled
at your lack of promotion.

165
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:11,317
Mother, I just wish
you would stop interfering.

166
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:15,029
I don't want promotion.
I'm happy where I am.

167
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:18,449
No, you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you.

168
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:21,702
He doesn't have your brains,
but he's got the ambition.

169
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:26,665
You haven't got the ambition. Luckily,
you've got me and the Deputy Minister.

170
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,792
Mr. Helpmann was very close
to your father.

171
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:32,087
Now please, Mrs. Lowry. Don't get upset.

172
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:35,216
Mr. Lowry, please wait in the reception.
You're giving her wrinkles.

173
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,051
- You see?
- God!

174
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:39,261
Just try and relax, Mrs. Lowry.

175
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:41,680
I'll make you 20 years younger.

176
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:45,017
Dr. Jaffe, you are a genius.

177
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:47,561
Would you like to be Surgeon General?

178
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:50,356
I know simply everybody.

179
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:53,776
They won't know you
when I've finished with you.

180
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:56,362
First,

181
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:58,822
we remove the excess derma.

182
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:05,663
Now the flaccid tissues under the eyes
and forehead.

183
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:12,378
Now, I lift

184
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:15,756
the wrinkles and the worry lines

185
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,842
right up into the wig, into the hairline.

186
00:18:21,346 --> 00:18:22,972
Now the template.

187
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:28,269
Now, a bit of sticky. Comme ça!

188
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:32,064
Already she's twice as beautiful
as she was before.

189
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:33,148
<i>Voilà!</i>

190
00:18:34,985 --> 00:18:37,695
Mr. Helpmann
was very close to your poor father.

191
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:41,156
He was close to me. He still is.

192
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:47,204
He'll take you under his wing
when you get to Information Retrieval.

193
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,206
You'll like it there.

194
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:51,625
You're not listening to me, Mother.

195
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:58,048
What the hell is this, lady?

196
00:18:58,174 --> 00:19:01,051
It's a present for my son. Really!

197
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:04,847
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.

198
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,559
What on Earth is it?

199
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:11,562
Something for an executive.

200
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:19,111
Madam Lowry! You look exquisite today.
Merry Christmas.

201
00:19:19,237 --> 00:19:21,572
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.

202
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:25,034
- You remember my son, Samuel?
- Of course.

203
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:26,952
We're joining Mrs. Terrain.

204
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:28,787
Yes, they're waiting.

205
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:39,256
- Mother, I thought we'd be able to talk.
- We will.

206
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:42,885
- Ida!
- God. She's got what's-her-name with her.

207
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:47,890
Well, Alma, how are you?

208
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:50,142
You look wonderful.

209
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:52,311
Hello, Shirley.

210
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:54,646
Thank you, Spiro.

211
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:57,149
- Salt?
- Not yet.

212
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:00,444
Sam, Happy Christmas.

213
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,823
- So sorry we're late.
- Thanks.

214
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:06,784
Now, Alma

215
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:08,869
what are you going to have?

216
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:12,539
I can't make up my mind whether to have
the number one or the number two.

217
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:14,291
What do you recommend, Spiro?

218
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,502
Between you and me, madame,

219
00:20:16,628 --> 00:20:19,421
- today the number two.
- Thank you, Spiro.

220
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:21,673
Shirley, what are you going to have?

221
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,844
Between you and me, mademoiselle,
today the number one.

222
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:27,763
Madam Lowry?

223
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:32,267
To hell with the diet!
I'm going to have a number eight, please.

224
00:20:32,352 --> 00:20:35,437
- A most perceptive choice, if I may say so.
- Oh, Ida.

225
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:37,689
<i>- Monsieur?</i>
- Steak, please, rare. Mother...

226
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:40,442
<i>- Monsieur, quel numéro?</i>
- I don't know which number.

227
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:42,653
- Mother, please...
- That one. There.

228
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:44,238
Thanks. Mother, will you...

229
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:48,409
Alma! You wicked girl.
You've started your treatments.

230
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:51,161
- Say the number, please.
- You noticed.

231
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:53,664
- You have to say the number!
- Go away!

232
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,624
I must tell you all about it.

233
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,292
Number three.

234
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:03,298
- Mother, will you listen to me?
<i>- Numéro huit.</i>

235
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:08,554
Braised veal in wine sauce.

236
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:15,811
It's too exciting.
I've left Dr. Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.

237
00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:18,188
<i>Numéro deux, duck à I'orange.</i>

238
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:20,441
- Chapman?
<i>- Excusez-moi.</i>

239
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:22,818
The acid man?

240
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:26,655
Really, Ida. Just because
his techniques are revolutionary.

241
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:29,867
I don't go around calling
Dr. Jaffe "the knife man."

242
00:21:29,993 --> 00:21:32,703
<i>Numéro un, crevettes à la mayonnaise.</i>

243
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,455
I am sorry, Alma.

244
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:37,458
- I didn't mean to...
- It's all right, Ida.

245
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:40,252
<i>Steak. Numéro trois!</i>

246
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:44,381
<i>Mesdames, monsieur</i>

247
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:47,259
<i>bon appétit!</i>

248
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:49,178
<i>- Merci!</i>
<i>- Merci!</i>

249
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:53,974
Acid, on the other hand, can be used
for such wonderfully subtle shading

250
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:56,143
such delicate nuances.

251
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:59,646
Like a Rembrandt etching.
And it is so much quicker.

252
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:03,692
If it wasn't for this complication,
it could've happened to anybody,

253
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,904
I'd have had this dressing off yesterday.

254
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:08,947
Shirley.

255
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:11,074
Salt?

256
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:36,225
What were we saying?

257
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:38,227
God, this isn't rare.

258
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:43,607
By the by, I saw the most wonderful idea
for Christmas presents at the chemist's.

259
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:46,235
Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.

260
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,237
That sounds marvelous!

261
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:52,074
It's good at any doctor's
and most of the major hospitals.

262
00:22:52,158 --> 00:22:55,869
It's also accepted
for gynecological examinations

263
00:22:55,954 --> 00:22:58,288
including Caesarian sections.

264
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:00,832
- Spiro.
- Madam, I don't know what to say.

265
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:05,128
This never happens to us. I'm going
to do something about it straightaway.

266
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:09,299
Sam, can't you do something
about these terrorists?

267
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,510
It's my lunch hour.

268
00:23:12,804 --> 00:23:14,638
Besides, it's not my department.

269
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:19,518
Actually, Alma, that's one of
the little things I've been dying to tell you.

270
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:23,939
Sam's being promoted
to Information Retrieval.

271
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:28,110
Why, that's wonderful!
Congratulations, Sam.

272
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,864
Stop it! I'm not being promoted.
I'm not going to Information Retrieval.

273
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:35,993
If I wanted to upset you, Mother,
I'd tell you where to stick it.

274
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:41,373
Pepper?

275
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:44,626
I've got to go.

276
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:47,588
You haven't had your dessert.

277
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:50,382
I don't want dessert,
promotion or anything!

278
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:54,845
Of course you want something.
You must have hopes, wishes, dreams?

279
00:23:55,054 --> 00:23:57,222
No, nothing. Not even dreams.

280
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,526
Sam.

281
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,477
Sam!

282
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,894
Oh, God!

283
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,294
Hello. Central Services?

284
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:54,548
I'm at 579B, Block 19,
Northwestern Section D.

285
00:25:54,632 --> 00:25:57,884
Exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway
at the Orange Blossom Flyover.

286
00:25:57,969 --> 00:26:01,221
I've got trouble with my air conditioning.
It's an emergency.

287
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:05,308
<i>Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, due to staff shortages</i>

288
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:09,813
<i>Central Services cannot take service calls</i>
<i>between 2300 and 0900 hours.</i>

289
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:12,315
<i>Have a nice day.</i>
<i>This has not been a recording.</i>

290
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,067
This is an emergency!

291
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:18,822
<i>- Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
- Look, I've got to have a heating engineer.

292
00:26:18,948 --> 00:26:21,825
<i>- Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
- Oh, shit!

293
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:47,851
Hello.

294
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:59,321
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

295
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,791
<i>Hello, Mr. Lowry.</i>

296
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,626
Yes, who is this?

297
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:16,213
<i>Put the phone down and raise your hands.</i>

298
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:18,381
What? Who is this?

299
00:27:22,053 --> 00:27:23,887
Nice and easy, now.

300
00:27:29,977 --> 00:27:32,896
Just keep your hands where I can see them.

301
00:27:58,339 --> 00:27:59,923
What are you doing?

302
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,514
Harry Tuttle, heating engineer,
at your service.

303
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:12,561
Tuttle?

304
00:28:14,355 --> 00:28:15,897
Are you from Central Services?

305
00:28:22,113 --> 00:28:23,780
I called Central Services.

306
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:25,282
They're overworked these days.

307
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:28,410
Luckily, I intercepted your call.

308
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:30,745
You did...

309
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,292
Just a minute.
What was that business with the gun?

310
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:38,086
Just a precaution, sir.

311
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:42,465
I've had traps set for me before now.

312
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:47,888
Plenty of people in Central Services would
love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.

313
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:51,766
Are you telling me that this is illegal?

314
00:28:58,566 --> 00:28:59,858
Well, yes and no.

315
00:28:59,942 --> 00:29:02,485
Officially, only Central Services
can touch this stuff.

316
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,070
Would you hold this, please?

317
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:06,907
But nowadays,
with all the new rules and regulations

318
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:08,992
they can't get decent staff anymore.

319
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:11,661
They turn a blind eye as long as I'm careful.

320
00:29:11,787 --> 00:29:15,165
But if they could prove that I've been
working on their equipment

321
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,500
that's a plate of a different color.

322
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:20,253
- Wouldn't it be simpler just to...
- Hold this, please.

323
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:21,671
Sorry, yes.

324
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:25,258
I was saying, wouldn't it be simpler
to work with Central Services?

325
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:27,302
I couldn't stand the...

326
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:31,181
- It's getting warm.
- You couldn't stand the what?

327
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:33,183
I couldn't stand the paperwork.

328
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,684
Listen,

329
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:38,104
this system of yours could be on fire,
and I couldn't turn on a kitchen tap

330
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:40,899
without filling out a 27B/6.

331
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,109
Bloody paperwork.

332
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:46,029
I suppose one has to expect
a certain amount.

333
00:29:46,197 --> 00:29:48,949
Why? I came into this
for the action, the excitement.

334
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:53,536
Go anywhere, travel light. Get in, get out,
wherever there's trouble. A man alone.

335
00:29:54,872 --> 00:29:56,247
They've got the whole country
sectioned off.

336
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,291
Can't make a move without a form.

337
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:17,560
Found it. There's your problem.

338
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:19,813
- Can you fix it?
- No, I can't.

339
00:30:19,897 --> 00:30:23,566
But I can bypass it with one of these.

340
00:30:26,028 --> 00:30:27,487
Fine by me.

341
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,244
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

342
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,668
Wait here. Wait.

343
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:50,760
The flashlight.

344
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:55,849
- Central Services.
- Central Services.

345
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:58,935
- Yes.
- You rang, sir.

346
00:30:59,061 --> 00:31:01,604
Trouble with your air conditioning?

347
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:03,273
No, it's all right.

348
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:07,360
It's fixed.

349
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:09,112
It's fixed?

350
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:13,241
Yes. I mean, it fixed itself.

351
00:31:13,534 --> 00:31:15,201
Fixed itself, did it?

352
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:17,370
Yes.

353
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:21,458
Machines don't fix themselves.

354
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,627
He's tampered with it.

355
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:28,715
Sorry you had a wasted journey.

356
00:31:30,092 --> 00:31:32,552
I think we ought to have a look.

357
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:37,390
Have you got a 27B/6?

358
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:38,808
A 27B/6?

359
00:31:46,984 --> 00:31:48,485
Now look what you've done to him.

360
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:52,655
Have you got a 27B/6?

361
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:55,075
Not as such.

362
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,912
But we'll get one.

363
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:02,248
It's all right, it's all right.

364
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:05,835
Sorry. I'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork.

365
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,838
Where would we be
if we didn't stick to the correct procedures?

366
00:32:08,923 --> 00:32:10,507
We'll be back.

367
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:13,051
We'll be back!

368
00:32:18,516 --> 00:32:19,766
Thanks for coming.

369
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,143
We'll be back, you clever bastard!

370
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,938
- Thank you.
- We'll show you.

371
00:32:32,363 --> 00:32:35,865
Thanks, Lowry.
You're a good man in a tight corner.

372
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:47,627
I just happen to work
at the Ministry of Information.

373
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:48,711
What?

374
00:32:50,381 --> 00:32:52,715
I just happen to know that

375
00:32:53,217 --> 00:32:57,220
Information Retrieval
are looking for an Archibald Tuttle,

376
00:32:57,304 --> 00:32:59,055
heating engineer.

377
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:04,561
You wouldn't by any chance... Would you?

378
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:09,399
My good friends call me Harry.

379
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:13,194
Information Retrieval?

380
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:15,405
The big boys.

381
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:23,121
What do they want you for?

382
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:29,627
Time to go.

383
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:31,713
How's that?

384
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:40,013
You really must let me give you something.

385
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:46,603
How much will it be for the work?

386
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:52,108
Come on. You did me a favor.
Just check the corridor.

387
00:33:55,404 --> 00:33:56,654
Thanks.

388
00:33:56,739 --> 00:33:59,574
Listen, kid. We're all in this together.

389
00:33:59,742 --> 00:34:00,992
Go on.

390
00:34:15,216 --> 00:34:16,341
AII clear.

391
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:47,830
I think Kurtzmann is getting suspicious.

392
00:34:51,126 --> 00:34:53,044
What's playing today?

393
00:34:53,712 --> 00:34:55,171
<i>Casablanca.</i>

394
00:34:55,256 --> 00:34:57,715
<i>Mr. Lowry, step in here, please.</i>

395
00:35:01,595 --> 00:35:02,845
<i>Lowry!</i>

396
00:35:04,682 --> 00:35:06,683
<i>Now, Mr. Lowry!</i>

397
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:22,740
Thank God you're here.
We're in terrible trouble.

398
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,166
Look at this.

399
00:35:32,251 --> 00:35:35,253
- It's a check.
- It's the refund for Tuttle.

400
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:36,629
Tuttle?

401
00:35:38,132 --> 00:35:40,091
Buttle. I mean Buttle.

402
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:42,593
It's been confusion from the word go.

403
00:35:42,678 --> 00:35:45,596
He was overcharged
for Information Retrieval procedures.

404
00:35:45,681 --> 00:35:48,599
And someone, somewhere,
is trying to make us carry the can.

405
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:52,312
Can I have a look?
I've never seen a refund check before.

406
00:35:52,396 --> 00:35:54,439
I'll bet it's Jeffries.

407
00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:57,525
Yes.

408
00:35:57,735 --> 00:36:00,903
He believes that people
should pay more for their interrogation.

409
00:36:00,988 --> 00:36:03,031
And B: he loathes me.

410
00:36:03,198 --> 00:36:04,949
We've got to get rid of it.

411
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:08,286
Send it to somebody else.
Better still, send it to Buttle.

412
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,954
After all, it's his check.

413
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:12,373
I've tried that. Look at this.

414
00:36:12,624 --> 00:36:13,666
You see?

415
00:36:13,751 --> 00:36:16,919
The population census
has got him down as dormanted.

416
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:20,590
The Central Collective Storehouse
computer has got him down as deleted.

417
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:21,674
Hang on.

418
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:24,135
Information Retrieval's
got him inoperative.

419
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:26,888
Security has got him down as excised.

420
00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:29,724
- Administration's got him as completed.
- He's dead.

421
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:33,311
Dead?

422
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:37,690
Well, that's awful.

423
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,073
We'll never get rid of the damn thing now.

424
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:47,742
What are we going to do, Sam?

425
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,952
Could try the next of kin.

426
00:36:57,961 --> 00:37:00,546
There we go. "Buttle, Veronica, Mrs."

427
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:02,006
Veronica?

428
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:05,259
What's the number on the check?

429
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:08,638
27156789

430
00:37:10,766 --> 00:37:14,268
/074328K.

431
00:37:17,272 --> 00:37:19,065
Right into memory.

432
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:22,443
Central Banking.

433
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:25,613
Veronica Buttle

434
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:27,573
Mrs.

435
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,034
Deposit.

436
00:37:45,134 --> 00:37:46,926
Thank God for that.

437
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:48,928
Would you like some tea?

438
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:00,857
There's a problem.

439
00:38:00,941 --> 00:38:03,401
She doesn't have a bank account.

440
00:38:07,406 --> 00:38:09,323
Well, that's it then.

441
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:13,578
I might just as well
go and hang myself now.

442
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:20,835
This could never have happened
before the stupid 7th tier reorganization.

443
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:22,545
That's Simmons' doing.

444
00:38:22,629 --> 00:38:25,047
He and Jeffries
always sit together at lunch.

445
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:26,466
Bastards!

446
00:38:32,806 --> 00:38:36,934
Perhaps we could lose the thing
behind a filing cabinet or something

447
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:40,480
- or burn it, eat it...
- Look. There is one solution.

448
00:38:40,564 --> 00:38:42,607
- What?
- Drive out to Mrs. Buttle

449
00:38:42,691 --> 00:38:46,152
Iet her sign at the back of the check.
She can cash it at the corner sweet shop.

450
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,198
That's brilliant, Sam.

451
00:38:50,282 --> 00:38:51,866
I'll even do it for you.

452
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,285
Here, authorize the check.
What's the address?

453
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:56,287
Everything's in here.

454
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,083
What shall I do next?

455
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,087
Pink and blue receipts.

456
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:08,799
Sign there, there and there.
And sign the check there.

457
00:39:14,598 --> 00:39:16,807
I think I've broken a bone.

458
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:20,978
My wrist is all limp.
What a pathetic creature I am!

459
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:25,816
I'll do it for you.

460
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:46,837
Right. I'll be on my way.

461
00:39:49,716 --> 00:39:50,883
Sam?

462
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:55,972
You are good to me, you know.

463
00:39:56,932 --> 00:40:00,017
<i>- Here's looking at you, kid.</i>
- Here's looking at you.

464
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:21,539
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>to bring you news of a terrorist bombing</i>

465
00:40:21,623 --> 00:40:23,165
<i>at the Blue Lagoon...</i>

466
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:06,125
Hello. I wonder if you could tell me where...

467
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:07,918
Piss off!

468
00:41:12,716 --> 00:41:13,966
Hello.

469
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,553
I'll never confess!

470
00:41:23,518 --> 00:41:26,145
Come on, you've got to interrogate me.

471
00:41:52,297 --> 00:41:53,798
Mrs. Buttle?

472
00:41:58,261 --> 00:41:59,762
Mrs. Buttle?

473
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:10,523
Are you Mrs. Buttle?

474
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:19,532
My name is Lowry.

475
00:42:21,284 --> 00:42:22,702
Sam Lowry.

476
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:28,249
I'm from the Ministry of Information.

477
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:33,629
I've come to give you a check.

478
00:42:38,885 --> 00:42:42,012
It's a refund, actually. There was a mistake.

479
00:42:42,597 --> 00:42:43,931
Mistake?

480
00:42:44,015 --> 00:42:47,518
Yes. Not my department, of course.
I'm only Records.

481
00:42:49,646 --> 00:42:54,608
I'll tell you what it is. It seems Mr. Buttle
was overcharged by Information Retrieval.

482
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:58,446
They don't usually make mistakes

483
00:42:59,114 --> 00:43:01,282
but I suppose we're all human.

484
00:43:05,996 --> 00:43:08,080
What happened to the...

485
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:15,337
Actually, my coming here
is rather unorthodox.

486
00:43:15,422 --> 00:43:20,176
Bringing you this check. Any payments are
normally made through Central Computer

487
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:22,636
but as there were certain

488
00:43:23,305 --> 00:43:26,807
difficulties, we thought,
rather than cause delay

489
00:43:27,392 --> 00:43:29,518
we'd let you have it now.

490
00:43:29,811 --> 00:43:32,104
It being Christmas and all.

491
00:43:33,106 --> 00:43:35,399
My husband's dead, isn't he?

492
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:41,572
I do assure you, Mrs. Buttle,
the Ministry is very scrupulous

493
00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:44,450
about following up
and eradicating any error.

494
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:47,244
But if you do have any complaints
you wish to make,

495
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:51,457
I'd be only too happy
to send you the appropriate forms.

496
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:54,335
What have you done with his body?

497
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:04,762
I don't know anything about that.
I'm really just

498
00:44:04,846 --> 00:44:07,056
delivering the check. So if...

499
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,143
Look, if you wouldn't mind
just signing these two receipts,

500
00:44:11,853 --> 00:44:15,856
I'd be only too happy to leave you in peace.

501
00:44:16,024 --> 00:44:18,108
He hadn't done anything.

502
00:44:18,527 --> 00:44:20,027
He was good!

503
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:26,116
What have you done with his body?

504
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:35,918
It isn't being very helpful, is it?

505
00:44:43,426 --> 00:44:46,762
I didn't have to come here,
you know, Mrs. Buttle.

506
00:44:48,098 --> 00:44:50,266
I'll kill you, you bastard!

507
00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:53,477
Stop it!

508
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,031
Are you all right?

509
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:09,201
Are you all right?

510
00:45:14,082 --> 00:45:16,000
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

511
00:45:16,084 --> 00:45:17,209
It's you.

512
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:20,129
Wait, stop! Don't go!

513
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:36,538
Stop! I had nothing to do with it. Wait!

514
00:46:36,623 --> 00:46:37,831
Stop!

515
00:47:01,064 --> 00:47:03,357
- Go away.
- Her name's Jill.

516
00:47:04,234 --> 00:47:05,401
What?

517
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:06,986
Jill?

518
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:08,737
Jill who?

519
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:10,280
Jill who?

520
00:47:11,616 --> 00:47:12,741
Layton.

521
00:47:15,036 --> 00:47:16,495
Jill Layton.

522
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:19,999
You're a very good little girl.

523
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:23,085
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for my daddy.

524
00:47:23,253 --> 00:47:25,963
He will be pleased when he gets home.

525
00:48:11,426 --> 00:48:14,720
Sam, I've just had
the transport pool onto me.

526
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:18,223
You don't know anything about a personnel
transporter gone missing, do you?

527
00:48:18,308 --> 00:48:20,017
Personnel transporter?

528
00:48:20,435 --> 00:48:21,435
What?

529
00:48:22,062 --> 00:48:24,855
The pranets, I had a personal transporter.

530
00:48:24,939 --> 00:48:27,316
I'll do the paperwork in the morning.

531
00:48:28,693 --> 00:48:31,403
Is it all right about Mrs. Tuttle...

532
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:33,489
Buttle's check?

533
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:36,241
Can I forget it?

534
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:39,745
What a relief. I'm gonna have nightmares.

535
00:48:42,957 --> 00:48:44,041
Damn! Blast!

536
00:48:45,293 --> 00:48:47,044
What's the matter?

537
00:48:47,629 --> 00:48:51,090
You don't happen to know
how to get round an IRQ/3, do you?

538
00:48:51,716 --> 00:48:54,259
AII information
on third level suspects is classified.

539
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:58,806
AII inquiries through Information Retrieval.
That's hopeless, they'll tell you nothing.

540
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,017
Come the time they want something
from us, yes.

541
00:49:02,227 --> 00:49:04,520
There's one way I could get round it.

542
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:08,482
- I could accept my mother's promotion.
- Yes.

543
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:09,817
No!

544
00:49:11,444 --> 00:49:13,195
You can't. You turned it down.

545
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,447
I didn't sign the form.

546
00:49:17,242 --> 00:49:18,534
I did it for you.

547
00:49:19,994 --> 00:49:21,787
- You didn't?
- I did.

548
00:49:23,206 --> 00:49:24,206
You didn't!

549
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:26,333
I did.

550
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:30,462
- Why did you do that?
- That's what you wanted, isn't it?

551
00:49:32,006 --> 00:49:33,507
I don't know.

552
00:49:34,217 --> 00:49:36,301
I don't know what I want.

553
00:49:37,846 --> 00:49:40,389
Come on, before they turn the lights out.

554
00:49:57,448 --> 00:49:58,699
<i>There is one way around it.</i>

555
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:02,870
<i>I could accept promotion</i>
<i>to Information Retrieval.</i>

556
00:52:21,426 --> 00:52:23,218
What are you doing?

557
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:25,220
My God, what's going on?

558
00:52:25,305 --> 00:52:27,180
Emergency procedures.

559
00:52:28,683 --> 00:52:30,851
I haven't got an emergency.

560
00:52:30,935 --> 00:52:32,477
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

561
00:52:32,562 --> 00:52:35,314
<i>Have a nice day.</i>
<i>This has not been a recording.</i>

562
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:39,234
Here. Sign that.

563
00:52:40,945 --> 00:52:42,154
What is it?

564
00:52:42,238 --> 00:52:45,615
It's a 27B/6. What do you think it is?
Where is he?

565
00:52:45,908 --> 00:52:48,243
Spoor, come here. I found it.

566
00:52:49,912 --> 00:52:51,621
Spoor, come here!

567
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:55,334
Look there, a bypass valve
on the transformer.

568
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:10,140
You've had that scab Tuttle here.

569
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:11,683
What are you talking about?

570
00:53:12,977 --> 00:53:15,187
Who fixed your ducts?

571
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,149
I told you before, they fixed themselves.

572
00:53:19,776 --> 00:53:22,235
Where did this come from,
out of your nostril?

573
00:53:28,034 --> 00:53:29,785
Central Services.

574
00:53:32,288 --> 00:53:34,873
They don't take kindly to sabotage.

575
00:53:39,045 --> 00:53:41,546
This place is in a terrible state.

576
00:53:42,507 --> 00:53:45,634
Just a minute. You're not gonna
leave it like this, are you?

577
00:53:45,885 --> 00:53:47,010
Why not?

578
00:53:47,095 --> 00:53:50,597
AII you got to do is blow your nose
and it's fixed, isn't it?

579
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:31,972
<i>What have you done with his body?</i>

580
00:57:50,796 --> 00:57:54,299
<i>Mrs. Ida Lowry requests the pleasure</i>
<i>of your company</i>

581
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:57,344
<i>at her apartment tonight from 8:30</i>

582
00:58:00,473 --> 00:58:02,057
<i>to midnight</i>

583
00:58:02,558 --> 00:58:04,809
<i>To celebrate the completion</i>

584
00:58:04,894 --> 00:58:07,228
<i>of her recent cosmetic</i>

585
00:58:07,563 --> 00:58:09,939
<i>surgery</i>

586
00:58:29,669 --> 00:58:30,919
Thanks.

587
00:58:31,212 --> 00:58:32,879
It's reply paid.

588
00:58:33,214 --> 00:58:34,422
Is it?

589
00:58:38,844 --> 00:58:40,178
Two, three.

590
00:58:40,262 --> 00:58:43,598
<i>Mother, I'm sorry but I am unable</i>
<i>to come to your party</i>

591
00:58:43,724 --> 00:58:45,850
You don't have to sing it.

592
00:58:45,935 --> 00:58:47,268
I don't?

593
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:57,278
Aren't you a bit late?
The party started an hour ago.

594
00:58:57,405 --> 00:59:00,156
Yes, it's backlog. Everybody complains.

595
00:59:00,783 --> 00:59:02,951
Was it all right otherwise?

596
00:59:12,086 --> 00:59:15,797
<i>Mr. Helpmann, I'm keen</i>
<i>to get into Information Retrieval.</i>

597
00:59:16,006 --> 00:59:19,134
<i>Mr. Helpmann,</i>
<i>I'm dying to get at this woman.</i>

598
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:30,687
Where's your invitation?

599
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:32,981
Don't shoot! Mother!

600
00:59:35,276 --> 00:59:38,653
Sam, I'm so glad you came.

601
00:59:39,947 --> 00:59:41,197
Come in.

602
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:43,158
Mother?

603
00:59:45,494 --> 00:59:47,954
Oh, God, Mother, is that you?

604
00:59:48,038 --> 00:59:50,874
Of course. Isn't it wonderful?

605
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:54,169
The bandages came off just this afternoon.

606
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:56,796
Come on, darling, join in the fun.

607
00:59:56,881 --> 00:59:59,215
Simply everybody's here.

608
00:59:59,341 --> 01:00:02,135
- Is Mr. Helpmann here? Stop shoving!
- He is.

609
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:05,513
Mr. Helpmann is here,
and he wants to talk to you.

610
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:07,807
Good. I want to talk to him.

611
01:00:07,892 --> 01:00:11,728
He says you're the first person
ever to refuse a promotion.

612
01:00:11,854 --> 01:00:15,815
- He thinks you should see a doctor.
- Actually, Mother, I've decided...

613
01:00:16,567 --> 01:00:18,359
Louis, you know Sam.

614
01:00:19,195 --> 01:00:20,987
Can you believe it?

615
01:00:21,363 --> 01:00:23,865
It's just me and my little knife.

616
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:25,241
Snip.

617
01:00:25,534 --> 01:00:26,743
Slice.

618
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:30,121
- Can you believe it?
- Congratulations.

619
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:32,791
- But this is just the beginning.
- Really?

620
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:35,668
Of course, yes.
You've seen her with her clothes off.

621
01:00:35,753 --> 01:00:38,880
Faces are a doddle
compared to tits and ass.

622
01:00:38,964 --> 01:00:42,884
- No hairlines.
- Really, Louis!

623
01:00:43,385 --> 01:00:46,095
I've been looking for you everywhere.

624
01:00:50,726 --> 01:00:53,561
Mother, I have to talk to Mr. Helpmann.

625
01:00:54,063 --> 01:00:56,314
- You stupid sod.
- Dear boy

626
01:00:57,316 --> 01:00:59,901
what do you think of your mother now?

627
01:00:59,985 --> 01:01:01,736
It will never last.

628
01:01:04,198 --> 01:01:05,573
Excuse me.

629
01:01:05,741 --> 01:01:07,909
Dr. Chapman, did you say something?

630
01:01:08,035 --> 01:01:10,370
That technique, I've tried it.

631
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,915
A nice effect, but highly unstable.

632
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:17,752
In six months,
she'll look like Grandma Moses.

633
01:01:18,254 --> 01:01:20,088
See here, Chapman.

634
01:01:20,172 --> 01:01:24,092
At least mine don't end up looking
like they've been mugged.

635
01:01:29,098 --> 01:01:33,351
<i>What have you done with his body?</i>

636
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:41,442
- What happened to you?
- There's a little complication.

637
01:01:41,527 --> 01:01:46,114
Dr. Chapman says it often happens
with a delicate skin like mine.

638
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,616
Nothing to worry about.

639
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:52,120
He's promised these bandages
will be off in a jiffy.

640
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:55,623
- Actually, there's someone I want to meet.
- I know.

641
01:01:59,461 --> 01:02:00,920
Here we are.

642
01:02:02,548 --> 01:02:05,633
I'm going to leave you two lovebirds
in peace.

643
01:02:07,887 --> 01:02:09,637
Hello, Shirley.

644
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,932
Come on.

645
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:15,393
Do you want a drink?

646
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,234
Chase those years away.

647
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:24,986
Listen, Shirley.

648
01:02:25,571 --> 01:02:29,157
Look, your mother and my mother
have the idea that...

649
01:02:30,326 --> 01:02:31,910
Look, I'm very flattered.

650
01:02:31,994 --> 01:02:35,663
And, well, I just don't want you
to be under any false impressions.

651
01:02:35,748 --> 01:02:37,332
It's all right.

652
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:39,667
I don't like you, either.

653
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:43,254
Sam!

654
01:02:44,506 --> 01:02:46,966
Jack! Excuse me, Shirley.

655
01:02:48,302 --> 01:02:49,844
I'm sorry.

656
01:02:52,848 --> 01:02:54,849
- Do you remember Alison?
- Good evening.

657
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,435
Alison, Sam Lowry, an old friend.

658
01:02:57,519 --> 01:02:59,520
Alison, yes, of course.

659
01:03:00,356 --> 01:03:02,857
- You look different.
- I'm two years older.

660
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:06,110
And she's been to Dr. Jaffe.
She doesn't like me telling people.

661
01:03:06,195 --> 01:03:08,196
But, in fact, she's really pleased.

662
01:03:08,322 --> 01:03:12,116
- I knew there was something different.
- Remember how they used to stick out?

663
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:13,368
What?

664
01:03:13,535 --> 01:03:15,870
Yes, well, rather.

665
01:03:16,455 --> 01:03:20,291
- I always used to wonder if they were real.
- What, my ears?

666
01:03:23,045 --> 01:03:26,214
- Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back.
- Yes, that's...

667
01:03:27,132 --> 01:03:29,509
I always wondered if she wore falsies.

668
01:03:29,593 --> 01:03:31,094
Mr. Helpmann.

669
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:33,596
False ears.

670
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:37,558
- Hello, Jack.
- You remember my wife, Alison?

671
01:03:37,685 --> 01:03:41,062
Of course, Barbara, isn't it? How are you?

672
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:43,690
Barbara's very well. How are you?

673
01:03:43,899 --> 01:03:45,400
- Fine, thanks.
- Good.

674
01:03:45,526 --> 01:03:49,612
Hello, Sam. Ida said you might be here.
Have you got a minute?

675
01:03:49,947 --> 01:03:51,781
Would you excuse us?

676
01:03:52,366 --> 01:03:55,201
Of course. Come on, Alison. Barbara.

677
01:03:57,371 --> 01:03:58,413
Sam,

678
01:04:02,751 --> 01:04:04,419
I need your help.

679
01:04:27,651 --> 01:04:29,235
Thanks very much.

680
01:04:29,319 --> 01:04:31,696
Mr. Helpmann, I'm glad to be of help.

681
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,948
And if I can help you...

682
01:04:40,122 --> 01:04:42,623
Your father and I were very close.

683
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:47,295
Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,
but we were close friends.

684
01:04:47,504 --> 01:04:49,797
Especially after the bombing.

685
01:04:51,175 --> 01:04:54,802
And now I keep his name alive
at the office every day.

686
01:04:55,971 --> 01:04:58,765
It's as though he's there
still speaking to me.

687
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:00,600
"'Ere I am

688
01:05:02,352 --> 01:05:03,519
"J. H."

689
01:05:06,482 --> 01:05:08,524
The ghost in the machine.

690
01:05:11,153 --> 01:05:13,988
I know he would've wanted me to help you.

691
01:05:16,658 --> 01:05:18,785
And I promised your mother

692
01:05:19,161 --> 01:05:22,955
that I'd take you onto the team
at Information Retrieval.

693
01:05:23,665 --> 01:05:26,334
- But I gather that you...
- Well,

694
01:05:27,044 --> 01:05:30,171
actually, Mr. Helpmann,
I've changed my mind.

695
01:05:30,964 --> 01:05:33,674
I've decided I'd accept the transfer.

696
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,344
If I'm not too late.

697
01:05:37,387 --> 01:05:38,721
Too late?

698
01:05:38,972 --> 01:05:40,848
That's for me to say.

699
01:05:42,226 --> 01:05:44,018
Well, then I am...

700
01:05:46,814 --> 01:05:49,315
Welcome to Information Retrieval.

701
01:06:22,766 --> 01:06:24,433
My name's Lowry.

702
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:27,228
Sam Lowry.

703
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:31,107
I've been told to report to Mr. Warrenn.

704
01:06:31,733 --> 01:06:33,568
Thirtieth floor, sir.

705
01:06:33,735 --> 01:06:35,403
You're expected.

706
01:06:39,575 --> 01:06:42,326
- Don't you want to search me?
- No, sir.

707
01:06:44,746 --> 01:06:47,248
- Want to see my ID?
- No need, sir.

708
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:52,795
- But I could be anybody.
- No, you couldn't, sir.

709
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:55,256
This is Information Retrieval.

710
01:06:56,508 --> 01:06:58,593
The lift's arrived, sir.

711
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:49,620
Half as terrorists, rest as victims.

712
01:08:50,622 --> 01:08:51,998
Definitely, no.

713
01:08:52,082 --> 01:08:54,583
My name's Lowry, Mr. Warrenn.
Sam Lowry.

714
01:08:54,668 --> 01:08:57,920
Yes. No. Cancel that. Okay.

715
01:08:59,214 --> 01:09:01,340
Glad to have you on board.

716
01:09:03,385 --> 01:09:05,678
Don't be ridiculous, Jenkins.

717
01:09:06,138 --> 01:09:07,263
Yes.

718
01:09:07,556 --> 01:09:09,932
You'll like it up here.

719
01:09:10,058 --> 01:09:13,519
We've got a crack team of...
Are they kidding? ...decision makers.

720
01:09:13,603 --> 01:09:17,857
In triplicate. I'm expecting big things...
Two copies to Finance! ...of you.

721
01:09:21,778 --> 01:09:23,696
Between you and me, Lowry,

722
01:09:23,947 --> 01:09:27,283
this department is about to be upgraded.

723
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,537
Here we are.

724
01:09:31,747 --> 01:09:34,415
Your very own number
on your very own door.

725
01:09:34,624 --> 01:09:37,460
And behind that door, your very own office.

726
01:09:37,544 --> 01:09:40,713
Congratulations, DZ/015.

727
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:42,715
Welcome to the team.

728
01:09:42,883 --> 01:09:45,217
Yes. No. Cancel that.

729
01:09:45,427 --> 01:09:47,595
Send two copies to Finance.

730
01:11:20,772 --> 01:11:24,525
You can't borrow any more chairs!
There's only one left in here now

731
01:11:24,609 --> 01:11:27,111
- and I need that to sit on!
- What?

732
01:11:30,157 --> 01:11:31,365
Sorry.

733
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:34,160
Who are you?

734
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,037
My name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.

735
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:39,999
Oh, yes, the new boy from next door.

736
01:11:41,668 --> 01:11:43,919
My name's Lime. Harvey Lime.

737
01:11:44,629 --> 01:11:46,422
Welcome to Expediting.

738
01:11:46,548 --> 01:11:49,967
Would you mind
if I borrowed your computer console?

739
01:11:50,051 --> 01:11:52,803
I'll let you have it back in 10 minutes.

740
01:11:52,888 --> 01:11:55,973
You want to take my console
into your office?

741
01:11:56,349 --> 01:11:58,601
Yes, just for a few minutes.

742
01:11:58,768 --> 01:12:00,478
I'll tell you what,

743
01:12:00,562 --> 01:12:03,898
you tell me what you want,
and I'll do it for you.

744
01:12:05,066 --> 01:12:07,359
I'm a bit of a whiz on that thing.

745
01:12:10,071 --> 01:12:11,447
AII right.

746
01:12:13,366 --> 01:12:16,952
- I need information on a woman named...
- A woman?

747
01:12:17,537 --> 01:12:18,996
- I see.
- Yes.

748
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:23,334
I know her age and distinguishing marks,
but I need an address, her place of work.

749
01:12:23,418 --> 01:12:25,669
This your dream girl, is it?

750
01:12:28,548 --> 01:12:30,841
Look, let me use your console.

751
01:12:31,259 --> 01:12:33,052
You must be joking.

752
01:12:33,386 --> 01:12:36,972
When there's a woman involved,
there's no stopping me.

753
01:12:37,933 --> 01:12:39,850
Let's have that sheet.

754
01:12:49,069 --> 01:12:50,903
Sod it, it's broken!

755
01:12:51,112 --> 01:12:53,531
But you haven't switched it on.

756
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:55,449
Oh, yes.

757
01:12:59,704 --> 01:13:01,830
You're putting me off standing there.
Go back to your office.

758
01:13:01,915 --> 01:13:04,833
I'll give you a knock when I've finished.

759
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:08,254
Go on, I'm not going to elope with her.

760
01:13:09,589 --> 01:13:10,965
AII right.

761
01:13:46,668 --> 01:13:47,835
Sam!

762
01:14:11,151 --> 01:14:12,276
Sam.

763
01:14:15,697 --> 01:14:17,031
Don't go.

764
01:14:19,326 --> 01:14:20,534
Please.

765
01:14:33,506 --> 01:14:34,673
Well?

766
01:14:35,717 --> 01:14:38,886
- Computers are my forte.
- Let me see.

767
01:14:40,138 --> 01:14:44,475
"Gillian Layton. Coloring: white.
Hair: blonde. Eyes: blue. Height: 5'4".

768
01:14:44,559 --> 01:14:47,061
"Distinguishing scar on left..."

769
01:14:48,146 --> 01:14:49,229
Is this all you've got?

770
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:53,400
Best to take things slowly
where some women are concerned.

771
01:14:53,693 --> 01:14:55,069
Let me see.

772
01:14:56,196 --> 01:14:57,905
Hey, that's mine!

773
01:14:59,157 --> 01:15:00,491
"Layton.

774
01:15:01,868 --> 01:15:04,078
"Truck driver. AII inquiries

775
01:15:04,162 --> 01:15:07,915
"reference officer 412/L. Room 5001."

776
01:15:11,211 --> 01:15:12,586
Lowry, glad I caught you.

777
01:15:12,712 --> 01:15:16,173
Send that back. Settling down?
I want this order rescinded.

778
01:15:16,257 --> 01:15:20,010
There's a query about a personnel
transporter you took out from the pool.

779
01:15:20,095 --> 01:15:23,013
Or was it a personnel carrier you took?

780
01:15:23,098 --> 01:15:27,559
Send that up to Security.
Anyway, tidy it up, there's a good chap.

781
01:15:27,852 --> 01:15:30,396
Get a new suit. You want the lift?

782
01:16:47,849 --> 01:16:49,475
Can I help you?

783
01:16:56,524 --> 01:16:58,609
I'm looking for Officer 412/L.

784
01:16:59,027 --> 01:17:01,153
He won't be very long now.

785
01:17:04,699 --> 01:17:05,699
I thought so.

786
01:17:12,373 --> 01:17:14,082
You may go in now.

787
01:17:19,422 --> 01:17:21,590
Not that one. That one.

788
01:17:22,634 --> 01:17:23,717
Yes.

789
01:17:31,559 --> 01:17:34,061
Excuse me, are you officer 412/L?

790
01:17:41,069 --> 01:17:42,444
Excuse me!

791
01:17:44,989 --> 01:17:45,989
Jack!

792
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:52,496
I heard you were coming aboard.
Congratulations.

793
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,915
- DZ/015.
- Thanks.

794
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,125
Are you officer 412/L?

795
01:17:58,586 --> 01:18:00,420
That's me. For Sam.

796
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:03,465
- A very happy Christmas.
- Thanks, Jack.

797
01:18:03,758 --> 01:18:06,635
- You're settling in all right?
- Yes, fine.

798
01:18:07,428 --> 01:18:08,595
I need some information.

799
01:18:09,097 --> 01:18:12,808
This is Information Retrieval,
not Information Dispersal.

800
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:15,853
Amy, don't throw the ball around in here.

801
01:18:16,145 --> 01:18:19,857
- I'm not Amy, I'm Holly.
- Did I call you Amy, darling? I am sorry.

802
01:18:19,941 --> 01:18:21,775
- A triplet?
- One of them, I think.

803
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:25,028
Barbara's taken
the other two Christmas shopping.

804
01:18:25,113 --> 01:18:27,906
You're not gonna
keep calling her Barbara, are you?

805
01:18:27,991 --> 01:18:31,743
Why not? Barbara's a perfectly good name,
isn't it? Don't you like it?

806
01:18:33,371 --> 01:18:35,122
Yes, it's fine.

807
01:18:36,207 --> 01:18:38,792
Come on, let's get these together.

808
01:18:41,296 --> 01:18:43,130
I need to find out about a woman.

809
01:18:43,214 --> 01:18:46,717
Come on, Chloe, let's show Uncle Sam
how we make the word "cat."

810
01:18:46,801 --> 01:18:48,510
- Shall we?
- I'm Holly.

811
01:18:48,636 --> 01:18:50,220
Sorry, love. So you are.

812
01:18:50,305 --> 01:18:51,805
This is her.

813
01:18:53,725 --> 01:18:55,851
Layton. Oh, shit.

814
01:18:59,022 --> 01:19:01,315
- How much do you know about this?
- Not much.

815
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:04,192
- What does B58/732 mean to you?
- Buttle.

816
01:19:05,987 --> 01:19:08,822
I knew it. You always were bloody quick.

817
01:19:10,074 --> 01:19:11,408
Who else knows?

818
01:19:11,492 --> 01:19:13,243
Warrenn? Helpmann?

819
01:19:13,578 --> 01:19:15,913
I don't know.
I only know you got the wrong man.

820
01:19:16,623 --> 01:19:18,874
Information Transit got the wrong man.

821
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:22,502
I got the right man. The wrong man
was delivered to me as the right man.

822
01:19:22,587 --> 01:19:25,714
I accepted him on good faith
as the right man.

823
01:19:25,882 --> 01:19:26,882
Was I wrong?

824
01:19:27,634 --> 01:19:28,884
You killed Buttle?

825
01:19:30,929 --> 01:19:34,514
There are rigid parameters laid down
to prevent such things happening.

826
01:19:34,599 --> 01:19:38,310
It wasn't my fault that Buttle's
heart condition wasn't on Tuttle's file.

827
01:19:38,394 --> 01:19:40,062
How are you getting on?

828
01:19:43,024 --> 01:19:45,192
- I really need to know about...
- Tuttle?

829
01:19:45,276 --> 01:19:47,235
We'll bring Tuttle in

830
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,906
and interrogate him
at the same voltage as Mr. Buttle.

831
01:19:51,032 --> 01:19:53,200
And juggle the books in electrical banking.

832
01:19:53,534 --> 01:19:57,412
- What has Tuttle done?
- We suspect him of freelance subversion.

833
01:19:57,872 --> 01:19:59,206
Freelance subversive?

834
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:02,960
Then all I need to wrap up the case
is the Layton woman.

835
01:20:03,419 --> 01:20:07,255
- What has she done?
- She witnessed the Tuttle... Buttle arrest.

836
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:10,467
Since then she's been going around
making wild allegations

837
01:20:10,551 --> 01:20:12,260
trying to exploit the situation.

838
01:20:12,345 --> 01:20:14,721
She's working for someone,
and I don't think it's us.

839
01:20:15,974 --> 01:20:17,349
Terrorist?

840
01:20:20,228 --> 01:20:22,604
<i>Mr. Lint, the next customer</i>
<i>has been delivered.</i>

841
01:20:22,689 --> 01:20:25,148
- Thank you, Myrtle.
- What're you gonna do about Layton?

842
01:20:25,566 --> 01:20:29,444
I put her on the detention list.
Security should have her here before 6:00.

843
01:20:30,613 --> 01:20:32,030
What, here?

844
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,409
So that she can spill the beans
inside the department?

845
01:20:35,493 --> 01:20:36,743
Don't do that.

846
01:20:38,287 --> 01:20:41,456
Why don't I try and get to her for you? I'll...

847
01:20:41,916 --> 01:20:44,876
- I'll deactivate her.
- What does that mean?

848
01:20:44,961 --> 01:20:46,920
I want nothing unsavory.

849
01:20:47,255 --> 01:20:48,714
Trust me, Jack.

850
01:20:49,882 --> 01:20:52,217
Come on, put these away.
Mommy will be back.

851
01:20:52,301 --> 01:20:53,301
Let me have her file.

852
01:20:56,055 --> 01:20:57,639
Trust me, Jack.

853
01:20:58,975 --> 01:21:00,350
AII right.

854
01:21:03,187 --> 01:21:06,064
But for Christ's sake, don't lose it.

855
01:21:08,317 --> 01:21:09,776
You sit down there, darling.

856
01:21:11,696 --> 01:21:13,155
Don't worry, I'll get to her.

857
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:15,532
You'll never get anywhere
in a suit like that.

858
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:18,577
Here.

859
01:21:20,705 --> 01:21:22,039
Try this.

860
01:21:22,957 --> 01:21:24,541
- Bye-bye.
- 'Bye.

861
01:21:26,586 --> 01:21:28,170
But, Jack, I...

862
01:21:29,756 --> 01:21:33,383
Put it on, big boy. I won't look at your willy.

863
01:21:44,604 --> 01:21:46,021
Let him go.

864
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:29,749
Shit!

865
01:23:44,765 --> 01:23:45,891
Oi!

866
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,018
- Come out of there.
- What?

867
01:23:48,102 --> 01:23:50,604
That's the Deputy Minister's lift.

868
01:23:50,938 --> 01:23:52,856
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

869
01:23:53,274 --> 01:23:56,193
Come here, sonny. Let's see your ID card.

870
01:23:56,277 --> 01:23:57,444
My ID?

871
01:23:57,737 --> 01:23:58,945
Oh, God!

872
01:24:00,448 --> 01:24:01,990
This isn't my suit.

873
01:24:02,283 --> 01:24:04,743
Look, my name's Lowry, Sam Lowry.

874
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:07,913
- Look, really, can't this wait?
- No, sir.

875
01:24:08,456 --> 01:24:10,790
I'm going to have to fill in a report on this.

876
01:24:10,917 --> 01:24:13,460
Now, then, what is the date today?

877
01:24:13,961 --> 01:24:16,129
It's the... Oh, God, it'll have to wait!

878
01:24:16,214 --> 01:24:17,797
You, stop!

879
01:24:49,997 --> 01:24:51,039
Stop!

880
01:25:05,054 --> 01:25:07,681
Well done, men. Quick thinking.

881
01:25:08,683 --> 01:25:10,308
Excellent work.

882
01:25:12,478 --> 01:25:14,521
I'll take charge of her now.

883
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:15,855
Good.

884
01:25:18,025 --> 01:25:19,192
Okay.

885
01:25:21,237 --> 01:25:24,572
It's a classified matter.

886
01:25:26,367 --> 01:25:31,204
I'll include your fine handling
of the situation in my report.

887
01:25:32,206 --> 01:25:33,415
Great.

888
01:25:35,918 --> 01:25:38,003
Merry Christmas, Dawson.

889
01:25:38,504 --> 01:25:40,672
Come along with me, please.

890
01:25:40,756 --> 01:25:43,258
Okay, thanks. Well done, men.

891
01:25:43,926 --> 01:25:47,053
Excellent. Good turnout.
Very good, thank you.

892
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:09,367
Just keep moving.

893
01:26:09,452 --> 01:26:10,869
Hey, stop!

894
01:26:12,872 --> 01:26:14,414
Come back here.

895
01:26:14,749 --> 01:26:16,583
Pick up all these things.

896
01:26:16,917 --> 01:26:18,793
Come on, pick them up.

897
01:26:20,129 --> 01:26:21,588
Disgraceful.

898
01:26:22,715 --> 01:26:24,382
Can't you even...

899
01:26:24,467 --> 01:26:26,468
You illiterate foreign pig!

900
01:26:26,594 --> 01:26:29,804
You come over here
from your own filthy country

901
01:26:31,807 --> 01:26:33,892
and mess up our streets.

902
01:26:34,769 --> 01:26:35,935
God!

903
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,161
Well done! Let's go!

904
01:26:58,042 --> 01:27:01,461
What are you doing?
For Christ's sake, keep moving!

905
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:04,672
Get out of my cab.

906
01:27:04,799 --> 01:27:06,549
What? Just drive!

907
01:27:08,636 --> 01:27:12,222
- You've touched me. Nobody touches me.
- What do you...

908
01:27:13,015 --> 01:27:16,017
Please, drive on! Drive on, will you?

909
01:27:16,143 --> 01:27:17,727
Shit. Move over, I'll drive.

910
01:27:17,812 --> 01:27:20,647
Don't touch that! Don't touch anything!

911
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:28,029
It's okay, Officer. Thank you.
I've got everything under control.

912
01:27:28,531 --> 01:27:30,031
Oh, shit!

913
01:27:30,699 --> 01:27:35,161
Listen, please drive. Trust me.
You are in terrible danger.

914
01:27:35,371 --> 01:27:37,038
You're an embarrassment.

915
01:27:37,373 --> 01:27:39,332
Please drive. Trust me.

916
01:27:39,667 --> 01:27:41,793
Drive and I'll explain everything.

917
01:27:41,877 --> 01:27:44,879
Please, get out of my cab.

918
01:27:47,216 --> 01:27:48,591
I'm sorry, I...

919
01:27:48,801 --> 01:27:53,096
Okay, you've asked for it.
I'm Information Retrieval Officer

920
01:27:54,515 --> 01:27:57,267
DZ/105 and I'm arresting you so

921
01:27:58,102 --> 01:28:01,271
drive on, or I'll blast your fucking head off!

922
01:28:03,858 --> 01:28:04,858
Go!

923
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:29,549
Look, I'm sorry about that.
I mean, touching you without permission.

924
01:28:30,718 --> 01:28:33,970
Hello, my name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.

925
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:36,931
I've been...

926
01:28:41,187 --> 01:28:45,190
You won't believe this.
I know it will sound incredible

927
01:28:45,774 --> 01:28:48,318
but I've been dreaming about you.

928
01:28:48,944 --> 01:28:51,905
No, not like that. I mean, I love you.

929
01:28:52,448 --> 01:28:55,783
I mean, in my dreams, I love you and...

930
01:28:58,162 --> 01:29:00,205
Extraordinary, isn't it?

931
01:29:03,959 --> 01:29:05,293
Anyway.

932
01:29:10,966 --> 01:29:13,259
You don't believe me, do you?

933
01:29:15,137 --> 01:29:19,849
You probably think I'm bonkers, right?
Mad, raving.

934
01:29:21,519 --> 01:29:24,604
No! I think you're very attractive.

935
01:29:27,066 --> 01:29:28,233
What?

936
01:29:28,943 --> 01:29:31,861
Yeah. Sit back. Let me have a look at you.

937
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:41,412
Oh, yeah.

938
01:29:42,456 --> 01:29:44,958
Good looking, sexy. Just my type.

939
01:29:48,254 --> 01:29:50,088
I don't believe you.

940
01:29:50,839 --> 01:29:52,131
Why not?

941
01:29:52,716 --> 01:29:55,843
Well, I just don't deserve such terrific luck.

942
01:29:57,513 --> 01:29:59,222
You're damn right.

943
01:31:46,622 --> 01:31:48,498
You don't trust me, do you?

944
01:32:23,867 --> 01:32:27,870
- Oh, my God, we shouldn't have come here!
- I've got a job to do.

945
01:32:28,414 --> 01:32:30,206
But they'll be lying in wait!

946
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:33,793
Christ, you're paranoid.
You got no sense of reality.

947
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:35,586
Wait!

948
01:32:39,967 --> 01:32:43,553
- We should take the lorry and get away!
- Yeah, where to?

949
01:32:43,637 --> 01:32:47,056
- Anywhere. As fast as possible.
- There isn't anywhere.

950
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:50,143
- Just far away.
- It's not far enough.

951
01:33:07,494 --> 01:33:08,661
Jill!

952
01:34:01,965 --> 01:34:03,800
What's in the parcel?

953
01:34:05,344 --> 01:34:07,094
A Christmas present.

954
01:34:15,229 --> 01:34:16,687
It's heavy.

955
01:34:17,689 --> 01:34:19,649
Heavy Christmas present.

956
01:34:19,733 --> 01:34:22,026
If you don't trust me, open it.

957
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:24,445
No, it's fine.

958
01:34:25,906 --> 01:34:27,907
I'd spoil the wrapping.

959
01:34:28,367 --> 01:34:33,079
Anyway, if I want you to trust me,
it's only fair that I should trust you.

960
01:34:40,212 --> 01:34:44,924
Doesn't it bother you, the sort of things
you do at Information Retrieval?

961
01:34:46,927 --> 01:34:49,595
Suppose you'd rather have terrorists.

962
01:34:53,934 --> 01:34:57,144
How many actual terrorists
have you met, Sam?

963
01:35:00,607 --> 01:35:02,733
- Actual terrorists?
- Yeah.

964
01:35:07,656 --> 01:35:08,948
It's only my first day.

965
01:35:22,588 --> 01:35:24,005
A roadblock.

966
01:35:25,465 --> 01:35:27,842
- What're we gonna do?
- Stay calm.

967
01:35:27,968 --> 01:35:31,012
Don't slow down! Don't stop!

968
01:35:31,096 --> 01:35:34,307
Please, do as I say. Go straight ahead. Go!

969
01:35:36,268 --> 01:35:39,020
What the fuck are you doing, you stupid...

970
01:35:51,283 --> 01:35:54,702
We did it! We broke right through them!

971
01:36:02,502 --> 01:36:05,379
Faster! Don't let them see you. Just go!

972
01:36:08,258 --> 01:36:09,800
Keep going! Faster!

973
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:14,847
- Please, get your foot down!
- Stay off of me!

974
01:36:48,465 --> 01:36:49,882
Go faster!

975
01:36:55,973 --> 01:36:59,308
- What if we lose the house?
- Don't touch anything!

976
01:37:00,268 --> 01:37:01,978
Don't touch that!

977
01:37:24,418 --> 01:37:28,921
We did it! We did it!

978
01:37:35,595 --> 01:37:36,762
Oh, no!

979
01:37:51,862 --> 01:37:54,196
What would you like for Christmas?

980
01:37:54,281 --> 01:37:56,073
My own credit card.

981
01:38:07,419 --> 01:38:09,837
- Why have we come here?
- Go away.

982
01:38:10,338 --> 01:38:13,424
- Why don't we go back to my flat?
- Forget it.

983
01:38:13,508 --> 01:38:14,717
You don't trust me?

984
01:38:14,801 --> 01:38:18,137
Trust you? A man who hijacks my truck,
loses me my job

985
01:38:18,221 --> 01:38:20,890
has every security man in town
looking for me? Of course I do.

986
01:38:20,974 --> 01:38:23,225
- I was only trying to help.
- Yeah!

987
01:38:23,894 --> 01:38:27,104
I don't trust you either.
What's in that parcel?

988
01:38:27,814 --> 01:38:30,357
You saved it from the lorry.
It must be very special.

989
01:38:30,442 --> 01:38:33,694
I saved you from the lorry.
You're not very special.

990
01:38:33,779 --> 01:38:36,363
- I'm gonna open it.
- Don't touch it.

991
01:38:46,124 --> 01:38:47,249
Sam!

992
01:38:47,417 --> 01:38:48,918
It's me

993
01:38:49,336 --> 01:38:50,795
and Shirley.

994
01:38:53,381 --> 01:38:54,882
Mrs. Terrain!

995
01:38:59,054 --> 01:39:01,180
- That should hold it.
- Sam?

996
01:39:01,723 --> 01:39:03,265
Hello, Shirley.

997
01:39:07,104 --> 01:39:08,646
What's happened to you now?

998
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:12,191
My complication had a little complication.

999
01:39:12,651 --> 01:39:15,861
But Dr. Chapman says I'll soon be up

1000
01:39:15,987 --> 01:39:18,864
and bounding about like a young gazelle.

1001
01:39:19,616 --> 01:39:22,535
You buying a Christmas present
for your mother?

1002
01:39:25,372 --> 01:39:27,414
Yes, a little something.

1003
01:39:27,624 --> 01:39:30,960
Shirley and I come here regular-Iarly.

1004
01:39:32,254 --> 01:39:34,296
We love romantic lingerie.

1005
01:39:38,009 --> 01:39:39,844
Picture me in these.

1006
01:39:45,934 --> 01:39:47,184
Oh, my God!

1007
01:39:47,352 --> 01:39:49,728
Sam, where are you going?

1008
01:40:01,825 --> 01:40:02,992
Jill?

1009
01:40:26,266 --> 01:40:28,017
Are you all right?

1010
01:40:31,021 --> 01:40:33,063
You don't deserve to be!

1011
01:40:33,607 --> 01:40:35,774
What a bloody stupid thing!

1012
01:40:36,359 --> 01:40:38,235
How could you? Look at these people!

1013
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,570
My God!

1014
01:40:40,363 --> 01:40:42,531
It was a bomb!

1015
01:40:42,782 --> 01:40:46,202
I should've opened it.
I sat there with it next...

1016
01:40:47,704 --> 01:40:49,872
There's your bomb, asshole!

1017
01:40:54,085 --> 01:40:57,296
A bribe for official monkeys like you.

1018
01:41:01,218 --> 01:41:03,093
Make yourself useful.

1019
01:41:09,935 --> 01:41:11,101
Here!

1020
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:18,651
Don't touch her! She's hurt.

1021
01:41:21,988 --> 01:41:23,656
Don't touch her!

1022
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:28,577
Stop!

1023
01:41:37,003 --> 01:41:38,295
Sam, no!

1024
01:41:52,352 --> 01:41:55,104
These helmets make your scalp itch.

1025
01:41:55,188 --> 01:41:58,148
Don't mention it.
And they make you sweat.

1026
01:41:58,608 --> 01:42:01,360
Half the time I can never see
where I'm going.

1027
01:42:01,486 --> 01:42:04,780
It's a great Niagara of perspiration
coming down.

1028
01:42:05,448 --> 01:42:08,951
I'm lucky. I've got these thick eyebrows.

1029
01:42:09,327 --> 01:42:12,538
That keeps it up
and channels it out to the ears.

1030
01:42:12,622 --> 01:42:13,622
Jill!

1031
01:42:13,707 --> 01:42:14,790
Who's he?

1032
01:42:14,874 --> 01:42:18,127
I don't know,
somebody from Information Retrieval.

1033
01:42:18,211 --> 01:42:20,462
They're always hanging around in lingerie.

1034
01:42:20,547 --> 01:42:21,630
Where is she?

1035
01:42:24,884 --> 01:42:26,677
Jill, is that you?

1036
01:42:27,512 --> 01:42:30,514
Excuse me, sir.
That is government property.

1037
01:42:35,645 --> 01:42:37,980
Jill! Answer me!

1038
01:42:39,733 --> 01:42:42,484
I'm looking for a girl with blonde hair.

1039
01:42:42,569 --> 01:42:44,987
She's medium height, green eyes.

1040
01:42:45,071 --> 01:42:48,324
I don't know, sir.
They check all that at the depot.

1041
01:42:48,408 --> 01:42:52,578
We can't allow that.
It's more than our job's worth.

1042
01:42:53,204 --> 01:42:55,080
Jill, you must be here.

1043
01:42:55,165 --> 01:42:58,417
You can fill in an application form
if you're a relative.

1044
01:42:58,543 --> 01:43:00,586
Now do stop, sir, please.

1045
01:43:08,386 --> 01:43:10,262
Sorry about that, sir.

1046
01:43:10,764 --> 01:43:12,222
Regulations.

1047
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:21,023
This is a black eye
for the department, Lowry.

1048
01:43:21,107 --> 01:43:23,359
I don't care how you behaved at Records.

1049
01:43:23,443 --> 01:43:25,861
Informational Retrieval
is an executive branch.

1050
01:43:26,279 --> 01:43:28,864
We're proud of our reputation
and we protect it.

1051
01:43:28,948 --> 01:43:32,826
That convoy of personnel carriers
is still not accounted for!

1052
01:43:32,952 --> 01:43:35,996
I thought I told you to deal with it.
And what is this mess?

1053
01:43:36,247 --> 01:43:39,291
An empty desk is an efficient desk!
Good God!

1054
01:43:39,459 --> 01:43:43,045
Queries from Security. Searches
from Central Banking about a check.

1055
01:43:43,129 --> 01:43:46,548
Clarification notices from Accounting
about unreturned receipts!

1056
01:43:46,633 --> 01:43:49,593
- Mr. Warrenn, I have to find out...
- Shut up!

1057
01:43:49,969 --> 01:43:52,846
I don't know what's going on here, Lowry.

1058
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:58,560
But don't think you can intimidate us
with your friends in high places!

1059
01:43:58,645 --> 01:44:00,145
Now shape up!

1060
01:44:04,359 --> 01:44:07,444
Lime, I have to use your computer.

1061
01:44:07,529 --> 01:44:09,988
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.

1062
01:44:10,323 --> 01:44:13,951
You seem to have rather a lot
to get on with yourself.

1063
01:44:20,708 --> 01:44:21,750
Shit!

1064
01:44:22,836 --> 01:44:24,253
Come off it, Jack.

1065
01:44:24,337 --> 01:44:27,089
Of course you can check
to see if she's been arrested.

1066
01:44:27,173 --> 01:44:32,344
Sorry, Sam, this case has become
more complicated since last we talked.

1067
01:44:32,679 --> 01:44:36,056
But she's innocent, Jack.
She's done nothing wrong.

1068
01:44:36,182 --> 01:44:39,393
Tell that to the wives of the men
she blew up this afternoon.

1069
01:44:39,519 --> 01:44:41,520
She's not alone in all this.

1070
01:44:41,646 --> 01:44:43,605
We just had a report in that Tuttle

1071
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:47,401
has wrecked an entire flat
and sabotaged adjacent Central Services.

1072
01:44:47,527 --> 01:44:49,945
As a matter of fact,
it looks like in your block.

1073
01:44:50,029 --> 01:44:53,198
I'd keep my eyes open if I were you. 'Bye.

1074
01:44:54,534 --> 01:44:58,287
But, Jack, you don't think Tuttle
and the girl are in league, do you?

1075
01:44:58,371 --> 01:45:01,498
I do. Everything's connected.
AII along the line.

1076
01:45:01,583 --> 01:45:03,917
Cause and effect, that's the beauty of it.

1077
01:45:04,043 --> 01:45:07,754
Our job is to trace the connections
and then reveal them.

1078
01:45:09,883 --> 01:45:14,136
This whole Buttle-Tuttle confusion
was obviously planned from the inside.

1079
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:15,888
But, Jack...

1080
01:45:16,806 --> 01:45:18,640
She's innocent, Jack.

1081
01:45:20,768 --> 01:45:24,062
- We've always been close, haven't we?
- Yes, Jack.

1082
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:27,566
Until this all blows over,
just stay away from me.

1083
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:41,867
It's you!

1084
01:47:42,035 --> 01:47:45,203
What's happening?

1085
01:47:45,872 --> 01:47:48,624
Your thermostat's gone, and then some.

1086
01:47:49,792 --> 01:47:51,668
What happened to my flat?

1087
01:47:51,753 --> 01:47:53,462
Hello? What?

1088
01:47:54,213 --> 01:47:55,714
It's for you, but,

1089
01:47:56,215 --> 01:47:57,966
as you don't live here anymore.

1090
01:47:58,051 --> 01:47:59,468
- What?
- Absolutely.

1091
01:47:59,552 --> 01:48:01,136
Do you know what this is?

1092
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:04,222
This is an H2206

1093
01:48:04,599 --> 01:48:08,935
authorizing the compulsory,
temporary requisitioning of this flat

1094
01:48:09,062 --> 01:48:11,104
for our necessary repairs.

1095
01:48:14,901 --> 01:48:17,027
Don't forget your receipt!

1096
01:48:19,364 --> 01:48:22,407
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler
for paperwork.

1097
01:48:26,329 --> 01:48:27,663
Bastards!

1098
01:48:40,802 --> 01:48:42,594
What are you doing?

1099
01:49:30,435 --> 01:49:32,561
It's getting cold in here.

1100
01:49:34,772 --> 01:49:35,981
Oh, God!

1101
01:49:36,733 --> 01:49:38,400
It smells badly.

1102
01:49:39,277 --> 01:49:42,028
It's shit! We're filling up with shit!

1103
01:49:58,296 --> 01:49:59,588
Oh, shit.

1104
01:50:01,966 --> 01:50:04,301
We're all in it together, kid.

1105
01:50:16,439 --> 01:50:18,732
Jill!

1106
01:50:23,571 --> 01:50:25,322
Are you all right?

1107
01:50:26,073 --> 01:50:29,743
- What happened to you after...
- Your face. Are you hurt?

1108
01:50:31,621 --> 01:50:33,121
No, I'm fine.

1109
01:50:37,084 --> 01:50:39,586
I've been worried sick about you.

1110
01:50:52,767 --> 01:50:55,560
- Who was that?
- That's a friend of mine.

1111
01:50:57,313 --> 01:50:59,022
Oh, God! Holy shit!

1112
01:50:59,357 --> 01:51:01,316
We better get out of here, quick. Come on.

1113
01:51:07,031 --> 01:51:08,990
Thank God! Here, take it.

1114
01:51:11,327 --> 01:51:12,953
It's not so big.

1115
01:52:05,006 --> 01:52:06,840
Are you sure this is all right?

1116
01:52:06,924 --> 01:52:08,425
Yes, certain.

1117
01:52:09,844 --> 01:52:12,220
My mother's away for Christmas.

1118
01:52:13,306 --> 01:52:16,266
She's spending it at the plastic surgeon's.

1119
01:52:19,353 --> 01:52:21,563
The wraps come off tomorrow.

1120
01:53:02,063 --> 01:53:05,815
Lock the door after me.
Don't answer the phone to anyone.

1121
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,068
I won't be long.

1122
01:53:09,737 --> 01:53:12,405
- Where're you going?
- I know a way to save you.

1123
01:53:12,490 --> 01:53:14,616
Trust me. I can do it.

1124
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:16,409
You can't go without me!

1125
01:53:52,029 --> 01:53:55,115
Excuse me, Dawson, could you
put me through to Mr. Helpmann's office?

1126
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:59,327
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have
to go through the proper channels.

1127
01:53:59,412 --> 01:54:02,080
And you can't tell me what
the proper channels are

1128
01:54:02,164 --> 01:54:04,916
because that's classified information.

1129
01:54:05,543 --> 01:54:10,213
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing
its tradition of recruiting the brightest.

1130
01:54:10,965 --> 01:54:12,674
Thank you, Dawson.

1131
01:54:19,807 --> 01:54:22,684
- Goodnight, Mr. Lime.
- Goodnight, Dawson.

1132
01:54:53,591 --> 01:54:57,343
No, no, Arthur. You're flat on the G!

1133
01:54:57,428 --> 01:55:01,056
It's your breathing.
Take a deep breath after "Noel."

1134
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:03,099
Ready, one, two, three.

1135
01:55:14,737 --> 01:55:18,239
<i>"'Ere I am, J.H."</i>

1136
01:55:19,325 --> 01:55:21,159
<i>The ghost in the machine.</i>

1137
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:49,979
Mr. Helpmann?

1138
01:56:27,768 --> 01:56:29,269
Mr. Helpmann?

1139
01:57:52,645 --> 01:57:53,811
Jill.

1140
01:58:45,656 --> 01:58:46,656
Who's there?

1141
01:58:55,666 --> 01:58:57,417
What do you think?

1142
01:58:58,460 --> 01:58:59,794
Is it me?

1143
01:59:06,468 --> 01:59:07,635
What?

1144
01:59:13,183 --> 01:59:15,226
You don't exist anymore.

1145
01:59:16,186 --> 01:59:17,854
I've killed you.

1146
01:59:22,651 --> 01:59:24,485
Jill Layton is dead.

1147
01:59:33,245 --> 01:59:35,580
Care for a little necrophilia?

1148
02:00:39,353 --> 02:00:41,020
Merry Christmas.

1149
02:00:54,535 --> 02:00:56,702
Something for an executive?

1150
02:01:15,055 --> 02:01:16,472
She's dead.

1151
02:01:16,890 --> 02:01:18,975
This is a friend of mine.

1152
02:01:21,728 --> 02:01:22,770
No!

1153
02:01:24,231 --> 02:01:25,356
Sam!

1154
02:01:32,281 --> 02:01:35,867
93/HKS/608, you are charged
with the following:

1155
02:01:35,951 --> 02:01:38,369
"Giving aid and comfort
to the enemies of society.

1156
02:01:38,454 --> 02:01:40,746
"Attempting to conceal a fugitive
from justice.

1157
02:01:40,831 --> 02:01:44,417
"Passing confidential documents
to unauthorized personnel.

1158
02:01:44,501 --> 02:01:47,670
"Destroying government property,
viz. several personnel carriers.

1159
02:01:47,754 --> 02:01:50,590
"Taking possession under false pretences
of said carriers.

1160
02:01:50,674 --> 02:01:53,426
"Forging the signature
of the Head of Records.

1161
02:01:53,510 --> 02:01:56,971
"Misdirecting funds in the form
of a check to A. Buttle

1162
02:01:57,055 --> 02:01:58,848
"through unauthorized channels.

1163
02:01:58,932 --> 02:02:00,975
"Tampering with Central Services'
supply ducts.

1164
02:02:01,059 --> 02:02:03,853
"Obstructing forces of law and order.

1165
02:02:03,937 --> 02:02:06,272
"Disgracing the good name
of the government

1166
02:02:06,356 --> 02:02:08,816
"and the Department
of Information Retrieval.

1167
02:02:08,901 --> 02:02:12,695
"Disrupting the Ministry's
internal communicating system.

1168
02:02:13,447 --> 02:02:15,865
"Wasting Ministry time and paper."

1169
02:02:16,825 --> 02:02:20,328
Now, either you can plead guilty
to seven or eight of the charges

1170
02:02:20,412 --> 02:02:23,748
which will help keep costs down
within your means

1171
02:02:23,832 --> 02:02:28,085
or borrow a sum to be negotiated
from us at a very competitive rate.

1172
02:02:28,587 --> 02:02:31,756
We can offer you something
at eleven-and-a-half percent over 30 years

1173
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:34,926
but you will have to buy insurance
to qualify for this scheme.

1174
02:02:35,135 --> 02:02:37,261
If you prefer something more specific

1175
02:02:37,346 --> 02:02:40,139
say, against electrical charges over £70...

1176
02:02:40,307 --> 02:02:43,100
AII you're requested to do now
is sign this form.

1177
02:02:43,477 --> 02:02:45,061
Think carefully before you sign.

1178
02:02:45,145 --> 02:02:48,481
Thinking ahead in financial matters
is always a wise course.

1179
02:02:48,732 --> 02:02:50,024
Plead guilty.

1180
02:02:50,108 --> 02:02:51,609
It's cheaper.

1181
02:02:56,406 --> 02:02:59,617
Sam, what are we going to do with you?

1182
02:03:02,704 --> 02:03:04,205
Where's Jill?

1183
02:03:05,749 --> 02:03:07,625
I've got to find her.

1184
02:03:08,085 --> 02:03:11,003
Please, you've got to get me out of here.

1185
02:03:11,296 --> 02:03:15,007
I understand, Sam.
I know exactly how you feel

1186
02:03:15,342 --> 02:03:18,302
so I brought you a bottle of barley water.

1187
02:03:18,762 --> 02:03:20,805
Please help me.

1188
02:03:21,431 --> 02:03:24,559
I assure you,
I'm doing everything within my power.

1189
02:03:24,643 --> 02:03:27,520
But the rules of the game are laid down.

1190
02:03:27,896 --> 02:03:30,940
We all have to play by them. Even me.

1191
02:03:32,568 --> 02:03:36,195
It's all a mistake.
You've got to understand that.

1192
02:03:37,072 --> 02:03:41,742
From the Department's point of view,
there was certainly a bit of an own goal.

1193
02:03:41,827 --> 02:03:43,661
I'm not a terrorist.

1194
02:03:44,288 --> 02:03:47,164
You know that. Please get me out of here!

1195
02:03:47,666 --> 02:03:50,501
Sam, Information Retrieval is expensive.

1196
02:03:51,003 --> 02:03:54,088
You're running up an enormous bill
by not cooperating.

1197
02:03:56,508 --> 02:03:58,384
Please, Mr. Helpmann,

1198
02:03:59,344 --> 02:04:01,137
help me find Jill.

1199
02:04:06,685 --> 02:04:09,186
Sam, I think I ought to tell you.

1200
02:04:10,314 --> 02:04:14,108
I'm afraid she's upped stumps
and retired to the pavilion.

1201
02:04:16,653 --> 02:04:18,487
Thrown in the towel.

1202
02:04:19,906 --> 02:04:21,073
Dead?

1203
02:04:22,242 --> 02:04:23,367
Yes.

1204
02:04:24,161 --> 02:04:28,623
It's all a bit confusing, but it seems
she was killed resisting arrest.

1205
02:04:34,004 --> 02:04:36,380
No, it's all right. I did that.

1206
02:04:39,718 --> 02:04:42,595
The odd thing is
it appears to have happened twice.

1207
02:04:42,679 --> 02:04:45,389
A bit of a disputed call, I'm afraid.

1208
02:04:47,517 --> 02:04:48,726
Twice?

1209
02:04:49,978 --> 02:04:54,231
There you are. AII I can say is
don't fall at the last fence.

1210
02:04:54,566 --> 02:04:57,735
The finish is in sight.
See you in the paddock.

1211
02:04:58,070 --> 02:05:00,655
Do cooperate. Think of your mother.

1212
02:05:00,864 --> 02:05:03,240
Good luck. Keep your eye on the ball.

1213
02:05:03,325 --> 02:05:06,410
Got to go. Can't keep the orphans waiting.

1214
02:05:16,004 --> 02:05:17,046
No!

1215
02:05:35,357 --> 02:05:38,943
Don't fight it, son. Confess. Quickly.

1216
02:05:40,278 --> 02:05:44,532
If you hold out too long,
you could jeopardize your credit rating.

1217
02:06:35,375 --> 02:06:36,500
Jack?

1218
02:06:45,635 --> 02:06:46,927
Shut up!

1219
02:06:49,347 --> 02:06:51,932
Jack, I'm innocent. Please help me.

1220
02:06:52,309 --> 02:06:53,601
Bastard!

1221
02:06:56,146 --> 02:06:59,023
Jack, this is all a mistake. Please, Jack.

1222
02:06:59,107 --> 02:07:00,900
Take that mask off.

1223
02:07:06,239 --> 02:07:08,032
You stupid bastard!

1224
02:07:09,993 --> 02:07:11,911
How could you do this to me?

1225
02:07:12,078 --> 02:07:13,662
Jack, I'm frightened.

1226
02:07:13,747 --> 02:07:16,290
How do you think I feel? You shit!

1227
02:07:16,374 --> 02:07:18,042
- Jack...
- Shut up!

1228
02:07:22,756 --> 02:07:26,967
This is a professional relationship.

1229
02:07:30,972 --> 02:07:32,515
You can't!

1230
02:07:34,768 --> 02:07:36,435
No, Jack, please!

1231
02:08:25,902 --> 02:08:27,236
You okay?

1232
02:08:27,362 --> 02:08:28,612
Tuttle!

1233
02:08:29,155 --> 02:08:30,698
Call me Harry.

1234
02:09:18,622 --> 02:09:19,955
Let's go!

1235
02:14:30,183 --> 02:14:33,977
Mr. Lowry, so pleased you could make it.

1236
02:14:34,270 --> 02:14:36,021
Right this way.

1237
02:14:41,486 --> 02:14:43,153
It's a sad loss.

1238
02:14:43,947 --> 02:14:46,114
Your mother was with her at the end.

1239
02:14:50,578 --> 02:14:54,456
Mrs. Terrain has just received
that most wonderful of gifts.

1240
02:14:55,667 --> 02:14:58,001
She came to us physically new.

1241
02:14:58,670 --> 02:15:01,880
She goes hence from us
not so physically new.

1242
02:15:01,965 --> 02:15:04,341
But the spirit never grows old.

1243
02:15:05,927 --> 02:15:07,469
Madam Lowry!

1244
02:15:11,975 --> 02:15:13,225
Mother!

1245
02:15:14,852 --> 02:15:16,061
Sam!

1246
02:15:17,939 --> 02:15:19,356
Mother?

1247
02:15:21,234 --> 02:15:23,068
Stop calling me that.

1248
02:15:25,238 --> 02:15:28,156
Mother, please!

1249
02:15:28,658 --> 02:15:30,784
Is this guy bothering you?

1250
02:15:31,995 --> 02:15:33,036
Mother!

1251
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:38,458
Go away. This is a very sacred moment.

1252
02:18:48,316 --> 02:18:50,275
He's got away from us, Jack.

1253
02:18:50,359 --> 02:18:53,653
I'm afraid you're right, Mr. Helpmann.
He's gone.

1254
02:19:35,112 --> 02:19:38,657
<i>Tomorrow was another day</i>

1255
02:19:40,117 --> 02:19:44,037
<i>The morning found me miles away</i>

1256
02:19:45,331 --> 02:19:49,626
<i>With still a million things to say</i>

1257
02:19:53,130 --> 02:19:55,382
<i>Now</i>

1258
02:19:56,092 --> 02:20:00,387
<i>As twilight beams the sky above</i>

1259
02:20:01,430 --> 02:20:04,849
<i>Recalling thrills of our love</i>

1260
02:20:06,894 --> 02:20:10,897
<i>There's one thing I'm certain of</i>

1261
02:20:11,649 --> 02:20:16,403
<i>Return I will</i>

1262
02:20:18,239 --> 02:20:24,244
<i>To old Brazil</i>
