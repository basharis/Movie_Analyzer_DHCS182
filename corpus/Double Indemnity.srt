Why, hello there,
Mr. Neff.

7
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:25,334
Working pretty late, aren't you,
Mr. Neff? Late enough. Let's ride.

8
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:31,578
You look kind of all
in, at that. I'm fine.

9
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:35,106
How is the insurance
business, Mr. Neff? Okay.

10
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:37,779
They wouldn't ever
sell me any.

11
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:39,579

Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,
Claims Manager.

21
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:50,180
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.

22
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:53,621
Dear Keyes...

23
00:04:55,224 --> 00:04:58,215
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

24
00:04:58,294 --> 00:05:00,659
Well, I don't like
the word confession.

25
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,855
I just want to set you right
about something you couldn't see...

26
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:04,625
because it was smack up
against your nose.

27
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,891
You think you're such a hot
potato as a Claims Manager...

28
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:10,162
such a wolf on a phony claim.

29
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:15,172
Maybe you are, but let's take a
look at that Dietrichson claim.

30
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,570
Accident and double indemnity.

31
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:22,605
You were pretty good in there
for a while, Keyes.

32
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,506
You said it wasn't
an accident. Check.

33
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:28,348
You said it wasn't suicide.
Check.

34
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:32,346
You said it was murder. Check.

35
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:37,013
You thought you had it cold,
didn't you?

36
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,286
All wrapped up in tissue paper,
with pink ribbons around it.

37
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,883
It was perfect.

38
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:45,486
Except it wasn't, because
you made one mistake...

39
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:47,462
just one little mistake.

40
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,499
When it came to picking the
killer, you picked the wrong guy.

41
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:56,166
You want to know who
killed Dietrichson?

42
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,865
Hold tight to that
cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.

43
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,867
I killed Dietrichson.

44
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:05,810
Me, Walter Neff,
insurance salesman.

45
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,014

no visible scars...

47
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:16,413
Yes, I killed him.

48
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:20,146
I killed him for money...

49
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:21,815
and for a woman.

50
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:27,790
And I didn't get the money
and I didn't get the woman.

51
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:31,625

10 or 15 years ago.</i>

61
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,194
<i>This one must've cost somebody
about $30,000.</i>

62
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,727

finished paying for it.</i>

Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not
in. How soon do you expect him?

69
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:28,970

here, if that's any help to you.

What is it?

73
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:36,949
How do you do,
Mrs. Dietrichson?

74
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:38,950
I'm Walter Neff,
Pacific All Risk.

75

Pacific all what? The Pacific
All Risk Insurance Company.

76
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:44,245
It's about some renewals
on the automobiles.

77
00:07:44,323 --> 00:07:46,882
I've been trying to contact your
husband for the past two weeks...

78
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,121
but he's never in his office.
Is there anything I can do?

79
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:51,683
The insurance ran out
on the 15th.

80
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,889
I'd hate to think of your
having a smashed fender...

81

what you mean, Mr. Neff.

I've just been taking a sunbath.
No pigeons around, I hope.

85
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:08,433
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I hate to take up your time, but...

86
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:09,839
Oh, that's all right.

87
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,400
If you'll wait till I put
something on, I'll be right down.

Nettie, show Mr. Neff
into the living room.

89
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:19,379
Where would
the living room be?

90
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:21,884
In there, but they keep
the liquor locked up.

91
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:24,943

frames, were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...</i>

99
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,937

little red goldfish...</i>

<i>on the table behind

the truth, Keyes...</i>

102
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,938
<i>I wasn't a whole lot interested
in goldfish right then.</i>

103
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:03,974
<i>Or in auto renewals, or in Mr.
Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.</i>

104
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:07,953
<i>I was thinking about that dame upstairs,
and the way she had looked at me...</i>

105
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:10,717
<i>and I wanted
to see her again, close...</i>

106
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,519
<i>without that silly staircase
between us.</i>

107
00:09:18,764 --> 00:09:21,231
I wasn't long, was I? (Walter)
Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

108
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:24,790
Hope I've got my face on straight.
It's perfect, for my money.

109
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,300
Neff is the name, isn't it?
Yeah.

Philadelphia, if you know the story.

111

<i>What story?
The Philadelphia Story.</i>

112
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,530
Suppose we sit down and you
tell me about the insurance.

113
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:36,098
My husband never
tells me anything.

114
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:39,543
Well, it's on your two cars,
the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

115
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,005
We've been handling this insurance
for Mr. Dietrichson for three years...

116
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,607
and we'd hate to see
the policies lapse.

117
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:50,817
That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

118
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:53,545
As I was saying, we'd hate
to see the policies lapse.

119
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:56,421
Of course, we give them 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.

120
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:58,983
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

121
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:01,256
Couldn't I catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes?

122
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,263
I suppose so. But he's
never home much before 8:00.

123
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:04,662
That's fine with me.

124
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:06,756
You're not connected with
the Automobile Club, are you?

125
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:09,233
No, the All Risk,
Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

126
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:12,270
Somebody from the Automobile
Club has been trying to get him.

127
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,171
Do they have a better rate?
If your husband's a member.

128
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:16,298
No, he isn't.

129
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,537
Well, then he'd have to join the club
and pay the membership fee to start with.

130
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:22,306
I never knock the other fellow's
merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

131
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,338
The Automobile Club's fine. I can
do just as well for you, though.

132
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,610
I have a very attractive
policy here.

133
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:31,345
It wouldn't take me two minutes
to put it in front of your husband.

134
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,979
For instance, we're writing a new
kind of 50% retention feature...

135
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:36,079
in the collision coverage.

136
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:39,057
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

137
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:41,685
Well, I've been at it 11
years. Doing pretty well?

138
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,125
It's a living.

139
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:47,423
You handle just automobile
insurance, or all kinds?

140
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:50,934
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,
public liability, group insurance...

141
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:53,435
industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

142
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:54,832
Accident insurance?

143
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,134
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

144
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,228
[Chuckles]

145
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:02,270
Wish you'd tell me what's
engraved on that anklet.

146
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:05,235
Just my name.
As, for instance?

147
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:08,542
Phyllis.
Phyllis, huh?

148
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:12,013
I think I like that.
But you're not sure?

149
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:15,247
I'd have to drive it around
the block a couple of times.

150
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:18,050
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop
by tomorrow evening around 8:30?

151
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:19,987
He'll be in then.
Who?

152
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:23,288
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

153
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,260
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

154
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:27,693
if you know what I mean.

155
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:31,199
There's a speed limit in this
state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

156
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,530
How fast was I going, officer?
I'd say around 90.

157
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:37,235
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

158
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:39,534
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

159
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:41,335
Suppose it doesn't take.

160
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:43,773
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

161
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:46,743
Suppose I bust out crying and
put my head on your shoulder.

162
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:49,939
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

163
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:51,503
That tears it.

164
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:59,185
8:30 tomorrow evening then.
That's what I suggested.

165
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:01,916
Will you be here, too?
I guess so, I usually am.

166
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:04,321
Same chair, same perfume,
same anklet?

167
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:06,416
I wonder if I know
what you mean.

168
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,327
I wonder if you wonder.

169
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,398
<i>(Walter) It was a hot afternoon
and I can still remember...</i>

170
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,402
<i>the smell of honeysuckle
all along that street.</i>

171
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,701
<i>How could I have known that murder
can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?</i>

172
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:23,966
<i>Maybe you would
have known, Keyes...</i>

173
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,669
<i>the minute she mentioned
accident insurance, but I didn't.</i>

174
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:29,608
<i>I felt like a million.</i>

175
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:33,576
<i>I went back to the office
to see if I had any mail.</i>

176
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:36,943
<i>It was the day you had that truck
driver from Inglewood on the carpet.</i>

177
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:38,314
<i>Remember, Keyes?</i>

178
00:12:38,386 --> 00:12:40,785
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes
wants to see you.

179
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:42,753
He's been yelling for you
all afternoon.

180
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:44,790
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

181
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,881
Park this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

182
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,393
Hello, Walter.
Hi, George.

183
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:56,624
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

184
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,564
You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

185
00:12:58,635 --> 00:13:00,693
You're in a jam and
you know it. Says you.

186
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,999
All I want is my money. Says you.

187
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:05,698
All you're gonna get
is the cops. Hello, Walter.

188
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:08,934
This is Sam Garlopis from
Inglewood. Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

189
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,944
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

190
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:16,277
I ain't so good. My truck burned
down. Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

191
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,516
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

192
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:21,882
Some of them are phonies,
and I know which ones.

193
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:24,944
How do I know? Because
my little man tells me.

194
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:29,055
What little man?
The little man in here.

195
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,350
Every time one of these phonies comes
along, it ties knots in my stomach.

196
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:33,860
I can't eat.

197
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:37,158
Yours is one of them, Garlopis. That's
how I knew your claim was crooked.

198
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,755
So what did I do?

199
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:41,425
I sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon...

200
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:43,366
and they jacked up that
burned-out truck of yours.

201
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:44,959
And what did they find?

202
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:48,336
They found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings.

203
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:49,966
What shavings?

204
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:53,602
The ones you soaked with
kerosene and dropped a match on.

205
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,372
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor
guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

206
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:01,741
That's one way
of putting it.

207
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:04,046
I ain't feeling so good,
Mr. Keyes.

208
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,348
Here. Just a minute. Sign
this and you'll feel fine.

209
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:09,287
Sign what? It's a waiver
on your claim. Right here.

210
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:11,888
Here?
Here.

211
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:18,656
Now you're an honest man
again. Goodbye, Garlopis.

212
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:20,664
But I ain't got no more truck.

213
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:23,131
$2,600 is lot of dough
where I live.

214
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:25,691
What's the matter, Garlopis, don't
you know how to open the door?

215
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:29,067
Just put your hand on the
knob, turn it to the left.

216
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:31,906
Now pull it toward you.

217
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:36,666
That's the boy.
Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

218
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,307
What kind of an outfit
is this, anyway?

219
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,111
Are we an insurance company, or
just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

220
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,412
to write a policy
on a mug like that?

221
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,111
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

222
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,744
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application...

223
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:50,810
to have him
thoroughly investigated...

224
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:52,616
before we accepted the risk.
I know you did, Walter.

225
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,351
I'm not beefing at you. It's the
company. It's the way they do things.

226
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:56,516
The way they don't do things!

227
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:59,322
The way they'll write anything just
to get it down on the sales sheet.

228
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:01,886
And I'm the guy that has to sit
here up to my neck in phony claims...

229
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:04,898
so they won't throw more money out the
window than they take in at the door.

230
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,796
Okay, turn the record over,
let's hear the other side.

231
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:10,200
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick
up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...

232
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,964
dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy...

233
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,903
who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes.

234
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:16,566
Walter, I've had 26 years of this
and let me tell you, I'm getting...

235
00:15:16,642 --> 00:15:18,609
Yeah, and you've loved
every minute of it, Keyes.

236
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:22,510
You love it, only you worry about it
too darn much, you and your little man.

237
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:24,912
You're so darn conscientious,
you're driving yourself crazy.

238
00:15:24,982 --> 00:15:27,711
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday
unless you looked at the calendar.

239
00:15:27,784 --> 00:15:30,377
Then you'd check to see if it was
this year's or last year's calendar.

240
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:31,851
Then you'd find out
who printed the calendar...

241
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,717
<i>and find out if their calendar checked
with the World Almanac's calendar.</i>

242
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,983
Now, that's enough
from you, Walter.

243
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:39,288
Now, get out of here
before I throw my desk at you.

244
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:42,651
[Flicking match]

245
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:44,320
I love you, too.

246
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:53,293
<i>(Walter) I really did,
too, you old crab...</i>

247
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:56,669
<i>always yelling your head off,
always sore at everybody.</i>

248
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:00,536
<i>But you never fooled me with your
song and dance. Not for a second.</i>

249
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,077
<i>I kind of always knew that behind
the cigar ashes on your vest...</i>

250
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:05,545
<i>you had a heart
as big as a house.</i>

251
00:16:06,114 --> 00:16:08,775
<i>Back in my office there was a phone
message from Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

252
00:16:08,849 --> 00:16:10,577
<i>about the renewals.</i>

253
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:13,851
<i>She didn't want me to come
tomorrow evening.</i>

254
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,614
<i>She wanted me to come Thursday
afternoon at 3:30 instead.</i>

255
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,422
<i>I had a lot of stuff lined up
for that Thursday afternoon...</i>

256
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,460
<i>including a trip
down to Santa Monica...</i>

257
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:27,293
<i>to see a couple of live prospects
about some group insurance.</i>

258
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:30,457
<i>But I kept thinking
about Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

259
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,067
<i>and the way that anklet
of hers cut into her leg.</i>

260
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:43,168
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?

261
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:45,805
I'm considering it.

262
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:50,010
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

263
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:53,049
Last night wasn't so
convenient. That's all right.

264
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:55,210
I was working on
my stamp collection anyway.

265
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:57,446
I was just fixing some iced
tea. Would you like a glass?

266
00:16:57,521 --> 00:16:59,784
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle
of beer that's not working.

267
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:02,449
There may be some. I never
know what's in the icebox.

268
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,718
Nettie.

269
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:11,322
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

270
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:14,128
Oh, you did? Yes. He'll
renew with you, he told me so.

271
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,760
As a matter of fact, I thought
he'd be here this afternoon.

272
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:17,995
But he's not?
No.

273
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,093
[Chuckles]

274
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,762
That's terrible.

275
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:23,396
Nettie!

276
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:26,768
Oh, I forgot,
today's the maid's day off.

277
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:30,745
Never mind the beer.
Iced tea will be fine.

278
00:17:30,813 --> 00:17:33,110
Lemon? Sugar?
Fix it your way.

279
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:38,376
As long as it's the maid's day off,
maybe there's something I can do for you.

280
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:41,615
Like running the vacuum cleaner. Fresh.

281
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:44,488
I used to peddle
vacuum cleaners.

282
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:46,490
Not much money, but you
learn a lot about life.

283
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,255
I didn't think you'd learned
it from a correspondence course.

284
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:54,026
Where'd you pick up
this tea drinking?

285
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:56,292
You're not English, are you?
No. Californian.

286
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,425
Born right here
in Los Angeles.

287
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:01,594
They say all native
Californians come from Iowa.

288
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:05,195
Mr. Neff, I...
Make it Walter, huh?

289
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:07,138
Walter.
That's right.

290
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:11,910
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance,
how much commission do you make?

291
00:18:12,112 --> 00:18:13,578
Twenty percent. Why?

292
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:16,274
I thought perhaps I could throw
a little more business your way.

293
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:18,942
I can always use it. I was
thinking about my husband.

294
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:21,417
I worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields.

295
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:23,783
It's very dangerous.
Not for an executive, is it?

296
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:25,253
He doesn't just sit
behind a desk.

297
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:27,619
He's right down there
with those drilling crews.

298
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:28,918
It's got me worried sick.

299
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:31,324
You mean, some dark night a
crown block might fall on him?

300
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:33,861
Please don't talk like that.
But that's the idea.

301
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:36,920
The other day a casing line
snapped and caught the foreman.

302
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,796
He's in the hospital with
a broken back. That's bad.

303
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:42,357
It's got me jittery
just thinking about it.

304
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:44,665
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband.

305
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:46,432
It could.
Well...

306
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:51,104
don't you think he ought to
have accident insurance? Mmm-hmm.

307
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:54,474
What kind of insurance
could he have?

308
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:56,774
Enough to cover doctors
and hospital bills.

309
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:58,905
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

310
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:01,381
And he'd rate around
$50,000 capital sum.

311
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,714
Capital sum? What's that?
In case he gets killed.

312
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,919
Maybe I shouldn't
have said that.

313
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:10,354
I suppose you have to think
of everything in your business.

314
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:11,822
Well, your husband
would understand.

315
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:14,689
I'm sure I could sell him on the
idea of some accident protection.

316
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:16,318
Why don't I talk
to him about it?

317
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:18,556
You could try,
but he's pretty tough-going.

318
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:20,723
They're all tough at first.

319
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:22,760
He has a lot on his mind.

320
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,562
He doesn't seem to want
to listen to anything...

321
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:27,467
except maybe
a baseball game on the radio.

322
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:31,740
Sometimes we sit here all evening
and never say a word to each other.

323
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:35,469
(Walter) Sounds pretty dull.
So, I just sit and knit.

324
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:38,175
Is that what you
married him for?

325
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:41,408
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

326
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:44,145
Anytime his thumbs
get tired...

327
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,582
Only, with me around,
you wouldn't have to knit.

328
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,744
Wouldn't I? You bet
your life, you wouldn't.

329
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:55,258
Wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet.

330
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,852
I want to ask you
something, Walter.

331
00:20:02,098 --> 00:20:05,692
Could I get an accident policy for
him without bothering him at all?

332
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:06,790
How's that, again?

333
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:09,836
It would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

334
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,427
I have a little
allowance of my own.

335
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:14,701
I could pay for it and he
needn't know anything about it.

336
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:18,336
Why shouldn't he know?

337
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,809
Because he doesn't want
accident insurance.

338
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:24,814
He's superstitious about it. A lot
of people are. That's funny, isn't it?

339
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:29,045
If there was a way to get it like
that, all the worry would be over.

340
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:33,080
See what I mean, Walter?
Sure. I got good eyesight.

341
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:35,884
You mean you want him to have
the policy without him knowing it.

342
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,983
And that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesn't know it.

343
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,857
That's the setup, isn't it? Is
there anything wrong with it?

344
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:43,259
No, I think it's lovely.

345
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,763
Then, if some dark, wet night,
that crown block did fall on him...

346
00:20:45,832 --> 00:20:46,889
What crown block?

347
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:50,059
Only sometimes it can't quite make it
on its own, it has to have a little help.

348
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:51,465
I don't know what
you're talking about.

349
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:52,968
Of course, it doesn't have
to be a crown block.

350
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,131
It can be a car backing over him, or he
could fall out of the upstairs window.

351
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:58,299
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

352
00:20:58,376 --> 00:21:00,605
Are you crazy?
Not that crazy.

353
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,407
Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
What's the matter?

354
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:09,376
Look, baby,
you can't get away with it.

355
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:12,843
You want to knock him off,
don't you?

356
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:14,385
That's a horrible
thing to say.

357
00:21:14,454 --> 00:21:15,750
What'd you think
I was, anyway?

358
00:21:15,822 --> 00:21:18,187
A guy that walks into a good
looking dame's front parlor and says:

359
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:20,224
"Good afternoon, I sell
accident insurance on husbands.

360
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:21,553
"You got one that's been
around too long?

361
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:23,287
"One you'd like to turn into
a little hard cash?

362
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:25,260
"Just give me a smile
and I'll help you collect. "

363
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,992
Boy, what a dope you must think
I am. I think you're rotten.

364
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,260
I think you're swell, so
long as I'm not your husband.

365
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:34,268
Get out of here. You bet
I'll get out of here, baby.

366
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:36,531
I'll get out of here,
but quick.

367
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,946
<i>(Walter) So I let her have
it straight between the eyes.</i>

368
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:51,539
<i>She didn't fool me
for a minute, not this time.</i>

369
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:53,250
<i>I knew I had hold
of a red-hot poker...</i>

370
00:21:53,318 --> 00:21:56,047
<i>and the time to drop it was
before it burned my hand off.</i>

371
00:21:56,788 --> 00:22:00,689
<i>I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of
beer, the one I had wanted all along...</i>

372
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:04,624
<i>only I wanted it worse now, to get rid
of the sour taste of her iced tea...</i>

373
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:06,592
<i>and everything
that went with it.</i>

374
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:09,857
<i>I didn't want to go back to the office
so I dropped by a bowling alley...</i>

375
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:12,455
<i>at Third and Western
and rolled a few lines...</i>

376
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,626
<i>to get my mind thinking about
something else for a while.</i>

377
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:20,700
<i>I didn't feel like eating dinner when
I left, and I didn't feel like a show.</i>

378
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:24,173
<i>So, I drove home, put the car
away and went up to my apartment.</i>

379
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,409
<i>It had begun to rain outside
and I watched it get dark...</i>

380
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:30,537
<i>and didn't even
turn on the light.</i>

381
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:32,413
<i>That didn't help me either.</i>

382
00:22:32,982 --> 00:22:34,312
<i>I was all twisted up inside...</i>

383
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:37,216
<i>and I was still holding on
to that red-hot poker.</i>

384
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:41,351
<i>And right then it came over me that I
hadn't walked out on anything at all.</i>

385
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:43,887
<i>That the hook
was too strong...</i>

386
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:46,516
<i>that this wasn't the end
between her and me.</i>

387
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,251
<i>It was only the beginning.</i>

388
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:49,350
[Doorbell ringing]

389
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:53,761
<i>So at 8:00 the bell would ring and I'd
know who it was without even having to think.</i>

390
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:56,760
<i>As if it was the most
natural thing in the world.</i>

391
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,472
Hello. You forgot your hat
this afternoon.

392
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,900
Did I? Don't you want me to bring it in?

393
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:08,734
Sure.

394
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:12,239
Put it on the chair.

395
00:23:20,953 --> 00:23:23,420
How'd you know where I live?
It's in the phone book.

396
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:26,017
It's raining.
Yeah.

397
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:28,955
Peel off your coat
and sit down.

398
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:33,119
Your husband out?

399
00:23:33,196 --> 00:23:35,186
Yes. Long Beach. They're
spudding in a new well.

400
00:23:35,264 --> 00:23:37,424
He phoned he'd be late.
About 9:30.

401
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,794
It's about time you said
you were glad to see me.

402
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,301
I knew you wouldn't
leave it like that.

403
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,361
Like what?
Like it was this afternoon.

404
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:48,737
I must have said something that
gave you a terribly wrong impression.

405
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:51,708
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

406
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:53,038
Okay.
No, it's not okay.

407
00:23:53,111 --> 00:23:55,943
Not if you don't believe me.
What do you want me to do?

408
00:23:56,947 --> 00:23:58,641
I want you to be nice to me.

409
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,940
Like the first time
you came to the house.

410
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:04,247
It can't be
like the first time.

411
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,117
Something's happened.
I know it has.

412
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:09,685
It's happened to us.

413
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:16,218
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.

414
00:24:17,597 --> 00:24:20,531
He keeps me on a leash
so tight I can't breathe.

415
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,123
He's in Long Beach,
isn't he? Relax.

416
00:24:23,502 --> 00:24:25,526
Maybe I oughtn't
to have come.

417
00:24:25,603 --> 00:24:28,298
Maybe you oughtn't.
You want me to go?

418
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:30,669
If you want to.
Right now?

419
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:32,037
Sure, right now.

420
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:47,985
[Walter sighing]

421
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:51,551
I'm crazy about you, baby.
I'm crazy about you, Walter.

422
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,349
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

423
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,386
I don't know.
I bought it in Ensenada.

424
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,656
You ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it.

425
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,630
The kind that bubbles.
All I got is bourbon.

426
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,664
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

427
00:25:13,707 --> 00:25:15,571
Get a couple of glasses,
will you?

428
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:25,148
Club soda?
Plain water, please.

429
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:30,014
You know, about six months ago a guy
slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub...

430
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,418
and knocked himself cold
and was drowned.

431
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:34,856
Only he had
accident insurance.

432
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:37,448
So they had an autopsy and
she didn't get away with it.

433
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:39,618
Who didn't?
His wife.

434
00:25:41,729 --> 00:25:44,196
Then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot.

435
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:47,494
His wife said he was cleaning a
gun and his stomach got in the way.

436
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:51,192
All she collected was a
three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

437
00:25:52,037 --> 00:25:54,061
Perhaps it was
worth it to her.

438
00:25:56,307 --> 00:25:58,900
See if you can carry that
as far as the living room.

439
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:05,872
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

440
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:08,541
A colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week.

441
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:11,676
Cook your own breakfast? Squeeze
a grapefruit once in a while.

442
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:14,686
Get the rest down at the corner
drugstore. Sounds wonderful.

443
00:26:14,755 --> 00:26:16,483
Just strangers beside you.

444
00:26:16,924 --> 00:26:19,255
You don't know them
and you don't hate them.

445
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:20,948
You don't have to
sit across the table...

446
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:24,223
and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life.

447
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:27,560
What daughter? You mean the
little girl on the piano?

448
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:29,660
Lola. She lives with us.

449
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:32,258
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

450
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:35,068
You ever think of a divorce?
He wouldn't give me a divorce.

451
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:36,570
I suppose because it'd
cost him too much money.

452
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:39,198
He hasn't got any money. Not since
he went into the oil business.

453
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:41,037
But he had
when you married him?

454
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:45,637
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?

455
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:50,111
But that's not the only
reason. I was his wife's nurse.

456
00:26:50,182 --> 00:26:53,776
She was sick a long time. When she
died, he was terribly broken up.

457
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,312
I pitied him so.
And now you hate him.

458
00:26:57,522 --> 00:27:00,285
Yes, Walter.
He's so mean to me.

459
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:03,319
Every time I buy a dress or a pair
of shoes he yells his head off.

460
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:05,121
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.

461
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:06,888
He's always been mean to me.

462
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:10,858
Even his life insurance all
goes to that daughter of his.

463
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:14,066
That Lola.
Nothing for you at all?

464
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:16,567
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

465
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:21,037
So you lie awake in the dark and
listen to him snore and get ideas.

466
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:24,107
Walter, I don't want
to kill him. I never did.

467
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,503
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

468
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,405
Only sometimes you wish
he was dead. Perhaps I do.

469
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:37,213
Then you wish it was an accident,
and you had that policy for $50,000.

470
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:39,813
Is that it?
Perhaps that, too.

471
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,083
The other night we drove home
from a party. He was drunk again.

472
00:27:45,426 --> 00:27:48,986
When we drove into the garage, he just sat
there with his head on the steering wheel...

473
00:27:49,062 --> 00:27:50,790
and the motor still running.

474
00:27:51,297 --> 00:27:54,857
And I thought what it would be
like if I didn't switch it off...

475
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:58,294
just closed the garage doors
and left him there.

476
00:27:58,369 --> 00:27:59,528
I'll tell you what
it'd be like.

477
00:27:59,603 --> 00:28:02,196
If you had that accident policy
and tried to pull a monoxide job...

478
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:04,364
We've got a guy
in our office named Keyes.

479
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,432
For him a setup like that'd be just
like a slice of rare roast beef.

480
00:28:07,543 --> 00:28:09,339
In three minutes he'd know
it wasn't an accident.

481
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:11,503
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting
under the hot lights.

482
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:13,739
In a half-hour you'd be signing
your name to a confession.

483
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:15,645
But, Walter, I didn't do it
and I'm not going to do it.

484
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:17,979
Not if there's an insurance
company in the picture, baby.

485
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:20,143
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

486
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:22,709
And if there's a death mixed up
in it, you haven't got a prayer.

487
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:25,847
They'll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

488
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:28,215
And I don't want you
to hang, baby.

489
00:28:31,228 --> 00:28:33,195
Stop thinking about it,
will you?

490
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:38,427
<i>(Walter)
So we just sat there.</i>

491
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,860
<i>She started crying softly, like the rain
on the window, and we didn't say anything.</i>

492
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:45,934
<i>Maybe she had stopped thinking
about it, but I hadn't.</i>

493
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:47,230
I couldn't.

494
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,743
Because it all tied up with something
I'd been thinking about for years.

495
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,539
Since long before I ever
ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

496
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:56,480
Because you know
how it is, Keyes.

497
00:28:57,014 --> 00:28:58,173
In this business
you can't sleep...

498
00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:01,081
for trying to figure out all the
tricks they could pull on you.

499
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:02,617
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

500
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:05,984
watching the customers to make
sure they don't crook the house.

501
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:09,719
And then one night, you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself.

502
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:11,315
And do it smart.

503
00:29:11,393 --> 00:29:13,485
Because you've got that wheel
right under your hands.

504
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:15,687
You know every notch in it
by heart.

505
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:18,453
And you figure all you need
is a plant out front.

506
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,595
A shill to put down the bet.

507
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:22,759
And suddenly
the doorbell rings...

508
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:25,268
and the whole setup is right
there in the room with you.

509
00:29:29,106 --> 00:29:32,199
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying
to whitewash myself.

510
00:29:33,176 --> 00:29:36,633
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.

511
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:41,943
The stakes were $50,000, but
they were the life of a man, too.

512
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:45,317
A man who'd never
done me any dirt, except...

513
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,613
he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about.

514
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,383
<i>And I did.</i>

515
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,534
Will you phone me? Walter?

516
00:30:09,438 --> 00:30:12,235
I hate him.
I loathe going back to him.

517
00:30:12,374 --> 00:30:15,240
You believe me, don't you,
Walter? Sure I believe you.

518
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:21,205
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

519
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:23,612
They're not going
to hang you, baby.

520
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:25,239
It's better than
going on this way.

521
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:26,476
They're not gonna
hang you because...

522
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:28,348
you're gonna do it
and I'm gonna help you.

523
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:31,114
Do you know what you're saying?
Sure, I know what I'm saying.

524
00:30:31,189 --> 00:30:32,678
We're gonna do it
and we're gonna do it right.

525
00:30:32,756 --> 00:30:35,883
And I'm the guy that knows
how. Walter, you're hurting me.

526
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,950
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

527
00:30:39,028 --> 00:30:40,460
It's got to be perfect.

528
00:30:53,306 --> 00:30:55,830
Call me tomorrow. But not
from your house. From a booth.

529
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:57,771
And watch your step
every single minute.

530
00:30:57,843 --> 00:31:00,970
This has got to be perfect, you
understand? Straight down the line.

531
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,203
Straight down the line.

532
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:33,332
[Rain pattering]

533
00:31:36,172 --> 00:31:37,900
[Car engine starts]

534
00:31:40,175 --> 00:31:41,937
[Car driving away]

535
00:31:46,747 --> 00:31:48,441
<i>(Walter)
That was it, Keyes.</i>

536
00:31:48,516 --> 00:31:51,541
<i>The machinery had started to
move and nothing could stop it.</i>

537
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:55,709
The first thing we had to do was
fix him up with that accident policy.

538
00:31:56,154 --> 00:31:59,919
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
was his signature on an application.

539
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:03,483
So I had to get him to sign without
his knowing what he was signing.

540
00:32:04,728 --> 00:32:08,561
And I wanted another witness besides
Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.

541
00:32:09,331 --> 00:32:11,059
I was trying to think
with your brains, Keyes...

542
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:13,259
because I wanted
all the answers ready...

543
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:17,827
for all the questions you were gonna
spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

544
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:20,368
A couple of nights later
I went to the house.

545
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,200
Everything looked fine, except I didn't
like the witness Phyllis had brought in.

546
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,770
It was Dietrichson's
daughter, Lola.

547
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:31,340
And it made me feel
a little queer in the belly...

548
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:34,474
to have her sitting right there in
the room, playing Chinese checkers...

549
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:37,143
<i>as if nothing
were going to happen.</i>

550
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:40,714
(Walter) I suppose you
realize, Mr. Dietrichson...

551
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:42,085
that, not being an employee...

552
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:44,454
you are not covered by the
State Compensation Insurance Act.

553
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:47,823
The only way you can protect yourself is
by having a personal policy of your own.

554
00:32:47,895 --> 00:32:49,054
Yeah, I know
all about that.

555
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:50,595
The next thing
you'll tell me I need...

556
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:54,190
earthquake insurance and lightning
insurance and hail insurance.

557
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:55,994
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

558
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:57,864
we'd stay broke paying
for it, wouldn't we, honey?

559
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:01,803
What keeps us broke is you going
out and buying five hats at a crack.

560
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:03,567
Who needs a hat in California?

561
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,334
Dollar for dollar,
Mr. Dietrichson...

562
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:07,842
accident insurance is the
cheapest coverage you can buy.

563
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,776
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

564
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:11,937
Just as you say.

565
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:14,810
Suppose we just settle that
automobile insurance tonight.

566
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:16,109
Sure.

567
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,750
All we'll need on that is for you
to sign the application for renewal.

568
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:21,717
Phyllis, do you mind
if we don't finish this game?

569
00:33:21,788 --> 00:33:24,153
It bores me stiff.
Got something better to do?

570
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:25,484
Yes, I have.

571
00:33:26,758 --> 00:33:28,588
Father, is it all right
if I run along now?

572
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,787
Run along where? Who with? Just
Anne. We're going roller-skating.

573
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:33,624
Anne who?
Anne Matthews.

574
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:35,665
It's not that Nino
Zachetti again, is it?

575
00:33:35,732 --> 00:33:37,130
It better not be
that Zachetti guy.

576
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,427
If I ever catch you
with that...

577
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,864
It's Anne Matthews,
I told you.

578
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,027
And I also told you
we're going roller-skating.

579
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:45,197
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont
and Franklin, the northwest corner...

580
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,740
in case you're interested,
and I'm late already.

581
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:50,367
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.

582
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:52,807
Good night, Phyllis. Good
night, Miss Dietrichson.

583
00:33:52,878 --> 00:33:54,868
I'm sorry. Good night, Mr... Neff.

584
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:56,607
Good night, Mr. Neff.

585
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:01,618
A great little fighter
for her weight.

586
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,112
Now, if you'll just
sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

587
00:34:05,189 --> 00:34:07,588
Sign what? The applications
for the auto renewals.

588
00:34:07,657 --> 00:34:09,624
So you'll be covered until
the new policies are issued.

589
00:34:09,692 --> 00:34:11,386
When will that be?
About a week.

590
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,393
Just so I'm covered
when I drive up north.

591
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:15,292
San Francisco?
Palo Alto.

592
00:34:15,363 --> 00:34:17,091
He was a Stanford man,
Mr. Neff.

593
00:34:17,164 --> 00:34:19,597
And he still goes to his
class reunion every year.

594
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:23,226
What's wrong with that? Can't I
have a little fun, even once a year?

595
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:24,963
Great football school,
Stanford.

596
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:27,027
Did you play football, Mr.
Dietrichson? Left guard.

597
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,732
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?

598
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:30,136
The bottom line.

599
00:34:34,778 --> 00:34:36,802
Both copies, please.
Sign twice, huh?

600
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,176
Yes. One is
the agent's copy.

601
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:42,205
I need it for my files.
Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

602
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,421
Thank you,
Mr. Dietrichson.

603
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,322
Don't worry about the check, I can
pick it up at your office some morning.

604
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:54,621
How much you taking me for?
$147.50.

605
00:34:54,694 --> 00:34:57,389
I think that's enough insurance
for one evening, Mr. Neff.

606
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,655
Plenty.

607
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:05,227
Bring me some soda when you come
up, Phyllis. Good night, Mr. Neff.

608
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:06,324
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

609
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:08,996
I think you left your hat
in the hall, Mr. Neff.

610
00:35:24,517 --> 00:35:26,313
Good night, Mr. Neff.

611
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:30,180
All right, Walter?
Fine.

612
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:32,154
He signed it, didn't he? Sure
he signed it. You saw him.

613
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:34,155
Now, listen. That trip to
Palo Alto. When does he leave?

614
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:35,212
End of the month.

615
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:36,280
He drives, huh?
He always drives.

616
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,986
Not this time. You're gonna
make him take the train.

617
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:39,618
Why? Because it's all
worked out for a train.

618
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:42,061
Listen, baby. There's a clause
in every accident policy...

619
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,994
a little thing called
double indemnity.

620
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:46,966
The insurance companies put it in as
a sort of come-on for the customers.

621
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:49,194
That means they pay double
on certain accidents.

622
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,896
The kind that almost
never happen.

623
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,460
Like for instance, if a guy
is killed on the train...

624
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,973
they pay $100,000
instead of $50,000.

625
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,474
I see. We're hitting
it for the limit, baby.

626
00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:01,068
That's why
it's got to be the train.

627
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,212
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

628
00:36:05,282 --> 00:36:07,181
Straight down the line.

629
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:28,157
(Lola)
Hello, Mr. Neff.

630
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,795
It's me.

631
00:36:31,535 --> 00:36:33,900
Is anything wrong?
I've been waiting for you.

632
00:36:33,971 --> 00:36:35,062
For me? Why?

633
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:38,437
I thought you could let me ride
with you, if you're going my way.

634
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:47,036
Which way would that be?
Down the hill. Down Vermont.

635
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:50,106
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?

636
00:36:50,183 --> 00:36:51,513
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

637
00:36:55,955 --> 00:36:57,922
Going roller-skating, huh?

638
00:36:58,057 --> 00:37:01,423
You like roller-skating?
I can take it or leave it.

639
00:37:02,594 --> 00:37:05,494
Only tonight you're
leaving it? Yes, I am.

640
00:37:06,897 --> 00:37:09,524
I'm having
a very tough time at home.

641
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,965
My father doesn't understand
me and Phyllis hates me.

642
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:16,927
Sounds tough, all right. That's
why I have to lie sometimes.

643
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:18,402
You mean it's not
Vermont and Franklin?

644
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:20,405
It's Vermont and Franklin
all right.

645
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:23,601
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.

646
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:26,745
You won't tell on me,
will you?

647
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:29,541
I'd have to think it over. Nino's
not what my father says at all.

648
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:32,708
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC...

649
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:35,752
and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown.

650
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:38,480
Got behind in his credits,
flunked out.

651
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:42,580
Then he lost his job for
talking back. He's so hot-headed.

652
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:45,089
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

653
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,650
Guess my father thinks nobody's
good enough for his daughter...

654
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:49,958
except maybe the guy that
owns Standard Oil.

655
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,795
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.

656
00:37:55,201 --> 00:37:57,395
It'll all straighten out,
Miss Dietrichson.

657
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:01,633
I suppose it will sometime. This
is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

658
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,837
(Lola)
Nino? Over here, Nino.

659
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:18,076
This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
Hello, Nino.

660
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:19,785
The name is Zachetti.

661
00:38:19,854 --> 00:38:22,515
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave
me a ride from the house.

662
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:23,680
I told him all about us.

663
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:25,121
Why does he have to
get told about us?

664
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:27,181
We don't have to worry
about Mr. Neff, Nino.

665
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:28,816
I'm not doing any worrying.

666
00:38:28,894 --> 00:38:30,190
Just don't you
broadcast so much.

667
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:31,989
Well, what's the matter
with you, Nino?

668
00:38:32,063 --> 00:38:34,553
Why, he's a friend.
I don't have any friends.

669
00:38:34,631 --> 00:38:36,894
If I did, I like to pick
them myself. Come on.

670
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:39,298
Look, sonny, she needed a
ride, so I brought her along.

671
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:41,528
Is that anything
to get tough about?

672
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:44,071
All right, Lola, make up your
mind. Are you coming or aren't you?

673
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:45,935
Of course I'm coming.

674
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:51,773
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.

675
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:54,177
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

676
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:01,280
<i>(Walter)
She was a nice kid.</i>

677
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:04,520
<i>Maybe he was a little better
than he sounded.</i>

678
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:08,024
<i>But right then it gave me a nasty feeling
to be thinking about them at all...</i>

<i>with that briefcase right behind my head
that had her father's signature in it...</i>

680
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:13,987
<i>and what that signature meant.</i>

681
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:16,292
<i>It meant he was a dead pigeon.</i>

682
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:20,432
<i>It was only a question of time,
and not very much time at that.</i>

683
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,229
<i>You know that big market
up on Los Feliz, Keyes?</i>

684
00:39:24,003 --> 00:39:27,529
<i>That's the place Phyllis and I
had picked for a meeting place.</i>

685
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:29,699
<i>I already had most of
the plan in my head...</i>

686
00:39:29,774 --> 00:39:32,071
<i>but a lot of details
had to be worked out.</i>

687
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:35,703
<i>And she had to know them all
by heart when the time came.</i>

688
00:39:36,113 --> 00:39:38,740
<i>We had to be very careful
from now on.</i>

689
00:39:38,882 --> 00:39:41,509
<i>We couldn't let anybody
see us together.</i>

690
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:44,484
<i>We couldn't even talk to
each other on the telephone.</i>

691
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:47,419
<i>Not from her house
or at my office, anyway.</i>

692
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:52,420
<i>So she was to be in the market every
morning about 11:00, buying stuff.</i>

693
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:56,094
<i>And I could sort of run into
her there any day I wanted to.</i>

694
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,492
<i>Sort of accidentally
on purpose.</i>

695
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:01,855
Walter, I wanted to...
Not so loud.

696
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:04,995
I wanted to talk to you,
ever since yesterday.

697
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:07,194
Let me talk first.
It's all set.

698
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,761
The accident policy came
through. I've got it in my pocket.

699
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,773
I got his check, too. I saw
him down in the oil fields.

700
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:14,968
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

701
00:40:15,043 --> 00:40:17,909
The check's just made out to the
company, so it could be for anything.

702
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:20,776
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see?

703
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:23,907
Itll be all right that way, because
one of the cars is in your name.

704
00:40:23,983 --> 00:40:25,745
Open your bag. Quick.

706
00:40:30,923 --> 00:40:32,321
Can you get in
the safe-deposit box?

707
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,380
Yes. We both have keys.
Fine.

708
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,755
But don't put the policy in
there yet. I'll tell you when.

709
00:40:36,826 --> 00:40:39,555
Remember, you never saw it, you
never even touched it, you understand?

710
00:40:39,629 --> 00:40:42,222
I'm not a fool. Okay. When
is he leaving on the train?

711
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:43,764
That's just it. He isn't going. What?

712
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:45,731
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. The trip is off.

713
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,391
What happened?

714
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:51,971
Mister, could you reach me
that package of baby food?

715
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,699
That one up there?

716
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:59,474
I don't know why they always
put what I want on the top shelf.

717
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:02,438
Go ahead. I'm listening.

718
00:41:02,514 --> 00:41:04,879
He had a fall-down at the well.
Broke his leg. It's in a cast.

719
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:07,678
Broke his leg?
What do we do now, Walter?

720
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:10,378
Nothing. We just wait.
Wait for what?

721
00:41:10,453 --> 00:41:11,919
Until he can
take the train.

722
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:13,215
I told you it's got
to be the train.

723
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:14,618
But we can't wait.
I can't go on like this.

724
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:17,681
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and
do it quick, just to get it over with.

725
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:20,521
There are other ways. We're
not gonna do it other ways.

726
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:21,685
But we can't leave it
like this.

727
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:24,696
What do you suppose would happen if
he found out about the accident policy?

728
00:41:24,764 --> 00:41:26,822
Plenty. But not as bad as
sitting in that death house.

729
00:41:26,899 --> 00:41:29,696
Don't ever talk like that. Don't let's
start losing our heads, that's all.

00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:31,962
It's not our heads.

We're gonna do it right.
That's all I said.

It's the waiting
that's getting me.

It's getting me
just as bad, baby.

736
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,105
But we've got to wait.
Maybe we have, Walter, only...

737
00:41:48,183 --> 00:41:51,640
it's so tough without you.
It's like a wall between us.

I just came
from Norton's office.

The semiannual sales
records are out.

You're high man, Walter. That's
twice in a row. Congratulations.

00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:36,080
Thanks. How would you
like a cheap drink?

How would you like
a $50 cut in salary?

00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,985
Do I laugh now or wait till
it gets funny? No, I'm serious.

752
00:42:41,057 --> 00:42:44,355
I've just been talking to Norton.
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.

00:42:44,426 --> 00:42:45,756
Too much pressure
on my nerves.

00:42:45,827 --> 00:42:47,851
I spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed.

755
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:49,828
I've got to have an assistant
and I thought of you.

756
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:51,295
Me? Why pick on me?

757
00:42:51,365 --> 00:42:53,889
Well, because I've got a crazy
idea you might be good at the job.

758
00:42:53,967 --> 00:42:55,365
That's crazy, all right.
I'm a salesman.

759
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:58,631
Yeah. A peddler,
a gladhander, a backslapper.

760
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:00,465
You're too good
to be a salesman.

761
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:02,665
Nobody's too good to
be a salesman. Phooey!

762
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,231
All you guys do is just ring doorbells
and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

763
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,470
What's troubling you
is that $50 cut, isn't it?

764
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,068
Well, that'd trouble anybody.
Now look, Walter.

765
00:43:10,147 --> 00:43:13,115
The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

766
00:43:13,182 --> 00:43:15,081
It takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen.

767
00:43:15,151 --> 00:43:16,276
It's the hottest job
in the business.

768
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,578
Yeah, but it's still
a desk job.

00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:19,778
I don't want to be nailed
to a desk. Desk job?

00:43:19,854 --> 00:43:21,445
Is that all you can see in it?

771
00:43:21,522 --> 00:43:24,490
Just a hard chair to park your
pants on from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?

772
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:27,287
Just a pile of papers to shuffle
around, and five sharp pencils...

773
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,728
and a scratch pad to make figures on,
maybe a little doodling on the side.

774
00:43:31,797 --> 00:43:33,821
Well, that's not the way
I look at it, Walter.

775
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:37,994
To me, a claims man is a surgeon,
that desk is an operating table...

776
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:40,901
and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels.

777
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:44,769
And those papers are not just forms and
statistics and claims for compensation.

778
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,967
They're alive.
They're packed with drama...

and crooked dreams.

with your brains?

Yes, I am.
Can't I call you back, Margie?

No, you can't. I've only
got a minute. It can't wait.

the train. Are you listening?

Walter?
Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

00:44:31,376 --> 00:44:33,900
Only, make it snappy,
will you? He's on crutches.

796
00:44:33,978 --> 00:44:37,310
The doctor says he can go if he's
careful. The change will do him good.

797
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:40,144
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the
way you wanted it, on a train.

798
00:44:40,217 --> 00:44:42,776
Only with the crutches it makes
it much better, doesn't it?

00:44:42,852 --> 00:44:45,285
Yeah. Yeah,
that's 100% better.

Hold the line a minute,
will you?

801
00:44:48,256 --> 00:44:50,985
Keyes, suppose I join you in your
office? That's all right. I'll wait.

802
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:53,492
Only tell her
not to take all day.

00:44:55,262 --> 00:44:56,387
Go ahead.

00:44:56,729 --> 00:44:59,788
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.

805
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:01,696
It's still the same
dark street, isn't it?

806
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:05,030
And the signal is three honks
on the horn. Okay. Anything else?

807
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:06,826
No.

808
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,092
Oh, uh...

809
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,263
what color did you pick?

810
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,240
Blue. Navy blue. And the
cast is on his left leg.

811
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,170
Mmm-hmm.

812
00:45:15,711 --> 00:45:17,234
Yeah, that suits me fine.

813
00:45:17,312 --> 00:45:19,575
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

814
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:22,672
But it's straight down
the line for both of us.

815
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,876
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

816
00:45:26,953 --> 00:45:28,852
Sorry, Keyes.
What's the matter?

817
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:31,650
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?

818
00:45:31,724 --> 00:45:33,588
If I told you
it was a customer...

819
00:45:33,758 --> 00:45:35,816
Margie. I bet she drinks
from the bottle.

820
00:45:35,894 --> 00:45:37,758
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

821
00:45:37,828 --> 00:45:41,888
Why don't you, for instance? I
almost did, once. Long time ago.

822
00:45:41,964 --> 00:45:43,726
Now look, Keyes, I've
got to call on a prospect.

823
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:46,323
Even had the church
picked out, the dame and I.

824
00:45:46,401 --> 00:45:48,630
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

825
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:51,535
I was on my way to the
jewelry store to buy the ring.

826
00:45:51,605 --> 00:45:54,198
And then suddenly that little
man in here started working on me.

827
00:45:54,275 --> 00:45:55,798
So you went back
and had her investigated?

828
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:58,308
Yeah. And the stuff
that came out...

829
00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:01,644
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 16.

830
00:46:01,713 --> 00:46:04,237
There was a manic depressive in
her family, on her mother's side.

831
00:46:04,315 --> 00:46:05,941
She already had one husband.

832
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:08,109
He was a professional
pool player in Baltimore.

833
00:46:08,186 --> 00:46:10,244
And as for her brother...
I get the general idea.

834
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,948
She was a tramp from a long line of
tramps. Yeah. All right, all right.

835
00:46:14,023 --> 00:46:16,752
Now what do I say to Norton? What
about this job I want you for?

836
00:46:16,825 --> 00:46:18,382
I don't think
I want it, Keyes.

837
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:20,949
Thanks just the same.
Fair enough.

838
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:24,125
Only get this,
I picked you for the job...

839
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,358
not because I think
you're so darn smart...

840
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:29,765
but because I thought you were a shade
less dumb than the rest of the outfit.

841
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:39,932
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.

842
00:46:40,177 --> 00:46:42,303
You're just a little taller.

843
00:46:53,221 --> 00:46:54,585
<i>(Walter)
Yes, Keyes.</i>

844
00:46:54,654 --> 00:46:58,248
<i>Those Fates I was talking about
had only been stalling me off.</i>

845
00:46:58,325 --> 00:47:01,691
<i>Now they had thrown the
switch. The gears had meshed.</i>

846
00:47:01,794 --> 00:47:04,421
<i>The time for thinking
had all run out.</i>

847
00:47:05,163 --> 00:47:08,893
<i>I wanted my movements accounted
for up to the last possible moment.</i>

848
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:13,095
<i>So when I left the office I put my rate
book on the desk as if I had forgotten it.</i>

849
00:47:13,169 --> 00:47:15,193
<i>That was part of my alibi.</i>

850
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:19,368
<i>From here on, it was a question
of following the timetable...</i>

851
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:20,464
<i>move by move.</i>

852
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:25,402
<i>I got home about 7:00 and
drove right into the garage.</i>

853
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:28,413
<i>This was another item
to establish my alibi.</i>

854
00:47:29,782 --> 00:47:32,079
Hi, Mr. Neff.
Hello, Charlie.

855
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,980
How about giving
the heap a wash job?

856
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:35,211
How soon you gonna want it?

857
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:36,684
I got a couple cars
ahead of you.

858
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:38,277
Any time you get
to it, Charlie.

859
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,585
I'm staying in tonight.
Okay.

860
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,657
<i>(Walter) Up in my apartment
I called Lou Schwartz...</i>

861
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,023
<i>one of the salesmen
that shared my office.</i>

862
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:48,494
<i>He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll
call and there'd be a record of it.</i>

863
00:47:48,564 --> 00:47:50,861
<i>I told him I'd forgotten my
rate book and needed some dope...</i>

864
00:47:50,932 --> 00:47:53,866
<i>on the public liability bond
I was figuring.</i>

865
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:57,766
<i>I changed into a navy blue suit
like Dietrichson was going to wear.</i>

866
00:47:57,837 --> 00:48:00,930
<i>Lou Schwartz called me back
and gave me a lot of figures.</i>

867
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:03,440
<i>I stuffed a hand towel and a roll
of adhesive into my pockets...</i>

868
00:48:03,508 --> 00:48:07,500
<i>so I could fake something that
looked like a cast on a broken leg.</i>

869
00:48:07,578 --> 00:48:09,602
<i>Next, I stuck a card
inside the telephone box...</i>

870
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,512
<i>so that it would fall down
if the bell rang.</i>

871
00:48:12,582 --> 00:48:16,073
<i>That way I'd know if anybody
had called me while I was away.</i>

872
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:20,348
<i>Then I did the same thing to the
doorbell in case anybody came to see me.</i>

873
00:48:20,855 --> 00:48:24,483
<i>I left the apartment by the
service stairs. Nobody saw me.</i>

874
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:28,756
<i>I walked all the way from my
apartment to the Dietrichson house.</i>

875
00:48:28,828 --> 00:48:30,192
<i>I didn't want
to take the bus...</i>

876
00:48:30,262 --> 00:48:33,924
<i>because there was always the chance that
someone might remember seeing me on it.</i>

877
00:48:33,999 --> 00:48:35,989
<i>I was being that careful.</i>

878
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:38,994
<i>I could smell that
honeysuckle again.</i>

879
00:48:39,102 --> 00:48:42,264
<i>Only it was even stronger,
now that it was night.</i>

880
00:48:46,676 --> 00:48:49,872
<i>I slid the garage door open
as quietly as I could.</i>

881
00:48:50,211 --> 00:48:53,270
<i>She'd backed the sedan in,
just the way I told her to.</i>

882
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,836
<i>I'd figured it was
safer that way...</i>

883
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:57,974
<i>in case he got into the car
before she drove it out.</i>

884
00:48:58,051 --> 00:49:00,348
<i>I got into
the back of the car.</i>

885
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,887
<i>I lay there on the floor
and waited.</i>

886
00:49:02,954 --> 00:49:06,047
<i>All the time I was thinking about that
dark street on the way to the station...</i>

887
00:49:06,123 --> 00:49:07,919
<i>where I was to do it...</i>

888
00:49:07,992 --> 00:49:10,755
<i>and the three honks on the
horn that were to be the signal.</i>

889
00:49:10,827 --> 00:49:13,226
<i>About 10 minutes later
they came down.</i>

890
00:49:13,296 --> 00:49:15,024
All right, honey?
Yeah, I'm all right.

891
00:49:15,097 --> 00:49:17,530
I'll have the car out
in a second.

892
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,778
[Inaudible]

893
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:57,626
Take it easy, honey. We've
got lots of time. Yeah.

894
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:19,071
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless...

895
00:50:19,147 --> 00:50:20,875
you might end up
with a shorter leg.

896
00:50:20,949 --> 00:50:24,748
So what? I could break the other
one and match them up again.

897
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,609
It makes you feel pretty good
to get away from me, doesn't it?

898
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:31,384
It's only for four days. I'll
be back Monday at the latest.

899
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:50,767
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?

900

[Honking]

901
00:50:54,709 --> 00:50:56,835
What are you doing that for?

902
00:50:57,844 --> 00:51:00,311
What are you
honking the horn for?

You take care of the redcap
and the conductor.

907
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:04,859
Don't worry. Keep away
from me as much as you can.

908
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,397
Tell them I don't want to be
helped. I said, don't worry, Walter.

909
00:52:07,466 --> 00:52:09,695
You start as soon as
the train leaves.

910
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:12,428
When you get to the refinery, turn
off the highway onto the dirt road.

911
00:52:12,502 --> 00:52:14,059
From there it's exactly
eight-tenths of a mile...

912
00:52:14,137 --> 00:52:15,569
to the dump beside the tracks.
Remember.

913
00:52:15,638 --> 00:52:18,162
I remember everything.
No speeding.

914
00:52:19,508 --> 00:52:22,203
You don't want any cops stopping
you with him in the back.

915
00:52:22,276 --> 00:52:24,641
Walter, we've been through
all that so many times.

916
00:52:24,712 --> 00:52:26,975
When you leave the highway,
turn off all your lights.

917
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,172
I'll be back on
the observation platform.

918
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:31,910
I'll drop off as close to
the spot as I can.

919
00:52:31,984 --> 00:52:35,043
Let the train pass,
then dim your lights twice.

920
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:40,523

Thank you. My husband
doesn't like to be helped.

923

924
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,934
Car 9, section 11. Thank you.

925
00:53:06,545 --> 00:53:08,944
Here're the tickets. Take good
care of yourself with that leg.

926
00:53:09,013 --> 00:53:10,377
Yeah. You take it easy
driving home.

927
00:53:10,448 --> 00:53:13,883
I'll miss you, honey.

something fierce, doesn't it?

you left something behind.

I always do.

in my overcoat back in the section.

yourself a cigarette, Mister...

00:57:53,668 --> 00:57:58,262
<i>But she was perfect. No nerves. Not
a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.</i>

967
00:57:59,272 --> 00:58:02,331
<i>She dropped me a block
from my apartment house.</i>

968
00:58:03,142 --> 00:58:06,599
Walter, what's the matter?
Aren't you going to kiss me?

969
00:58:11,516 --> 00:58:14,143
It's straight down the line,
isn't it?

970
00:58:18,888 --> 00:58:22,345
I love you, Walter.
I love you, baby.

971
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:39,266
<i>It was two minutes past 11:00, as
I went up the service stairs again.</i>

972
00:58:39,337 --> 00:58:43,329
<i>Nobody saw me this time either. In
the apartment I checked the bells.</i>

973
00:58:43,406 --> 00:58:46,397
<i>The cards hadn't moved.
No calls. No visitors.</i>

974
00:58:47,911 --> 00:58:51,869
<i>Then I changed my clothes again.
That left one last thing to do.</i>

975
00:58:52,847 --> 00:58:56,839
<i>I had to go down to the garage.
I wanted Charlie to see me again.</i>

976
00:59:03,523 --> 00:59:06,423
You gonna use your car, after
all? I'm not quite through.

977
00:59:06,491 --> 00:59:08,355
Well, that's all right,
Charlie.

978
00:59:08,426 --> 00:59:10,518
Just going up to the drugstore
to get something to eat.

979
00:59:10,595 --> 00:59:13,563
Been working upstairs all night. My
stomach's getting a little sore at me.

980
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:15,222
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.

981
00:59:17,167 --> 00:59:19,157
<i>That was all there was to it.</i>

982
00:59:19,235 --> 00:59:21,896
<i>Nothing had slipped,
nothing had been overlooked.</i>

983
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:24,369
<i>There was nothing
to give us away.</i>

984
00:59:24,438 --> 00:59:28,066
<i>And yet, Keyes, as I was walking
down the street to the drugstore...</i>

985
00:59:28,142 --> 00:59:31,577
<i>suddenly it came over me that
everything would go wrong.</i>

986
00:59:31,645 --> 00:59:34,841
<i>It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true, so help me.</i>

987
00:59:35,014 --> 00:59:37,413
<i>I couldn't hear
my own footsteps.</i>

988
00:59:40,585 --> 00:59:42,814
<i>It was the walk of a dead man.</i>

989
00:59:50,726 --> 00:59:53,285
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes...

990
00:59:53,361 --> 00:59:57,228
and the next day was worse, when
the story had broke in the papers...

991
00:59:57,298 --> 00:59:59,197
and they started talking
about it at the office...

992
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:02,496
and the day after that, when
you started digging into it.

993
01:00:02,569 --> 01:00:06,504
I kept my hands in my pockets
because I thought they were shaking.

994
01:00:06,572 --> 01:00:08,801
I put on dark glasses so
people couldn't see my eyes.

995
01:00:08,874 --> 01:00:12,832
And then I took them off again so they
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

996
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,605
I tried to
hold myself together, but...

997
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,937
<i>I could feel my nerves
pulling me to pieces.</i>

998
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:24,516
Oh, Walter?
Hello, Keyes.

999
01:00:24,786 --> 01:00:26,946
Come along. The big boss
wants to see us.

1000
01:00:27,021 --> 01:00:29,318
The Dietrichson case?
Must be.

1001
01:00:29,489 --> 01:00:31,456
Anything wrong?
Well, the guy is dead.

1002
01:00:31,525 --> 01:00:35,426
We had him insured and it's gonna
cost us dough. That's always wrong.

1003
01:00:35,494 --> 01:00:37,757
What have they got so far?
Autopsy report.

1004
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:41,457
No heart failure, no apoplexy, no
predisposing medical cause of any kind.

1005
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:43,397
Died of a broken neck.

1006
01:00:43,534 --> 01:00:45,558
When's the inquest?
Had it this morning.

1007
01:00:45,636 --> 01:00:47,694
His wife and daughter
made the identification.

1008
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:50,567
The train people and some of the
passengers told how he went through...

1009
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,901
to the observation car.

1010
01:00:51,974 --> 01:00:55,534
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict? Accidental death.

1011
01:00:57,144 --> 01:00:58,610
What do the police figure?

1012
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:01,340
That he got tangled up in his
crutches and fell off the train.

1013
01:01:01,414 --> 01:01:03,040
They're satisfied.

1014
01:01:03,116 --> 01:01:05,743
It's not their dough.
Come on, Walter.

1015
01:01:07,219 --> 01:01:09,083
(Norton) All right. Thank
you very much, gentlemen.

1016
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,380
I believe the legal position
is now clear.

1017
01:01:11,456 --> 01:01:13,787
Please stand by.
I may need you later.

1018
01:01:13,857 --> 01:01:16,723
Come in, Mr. Keyes.
You, too, Mr. Neff.

1019
01:01:21,063 --> 01:01:23,360
You find this an uncomfortably
warm day, Mr. Keyes?

1020
01:01:23,431 --> 01:01:26,422
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, but I
didn't know this was formal.

1021
01:01:26,501 --> 01:01:27,865
Sit down, gentlemen.
Thank you.

1022
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,958
Any new developments?

1023
01:01:29,036 --> 01:01:31,663
I just talked to this Jackson long
distance, up in Medford, Oregon.

1024
01:01:31,738 --> 01:01:32,761
Who's Jackson?

1025
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:34,362
He's the last man who saw
Dietrichson alive.

1026
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,999
They were out on the observation
platform together, talking.

1027
01:01:37,075 --> 01:01:39,133
Dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so Jackson went back...

1028
01:01:39,211 --> 01:01:40,871
to get Dietrichson's
cigar case for him.

1029
01:01:40,945 --> 01:01:43,310
When he returned to the observation
platform, no Dietrichson.

1030
01:01:43,381 --> 01:01:45,245
Well, Jackson didn't think
anything was wrong until...

1031
01:01:45,315 --> 01:01:47,282
a wire caught up with
the train at Santa Barbara.

1032
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:50,079
They found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

1033
01:01:50,152 --> 01:01:52,642
Very interesting about
the cigar case.

1034
01:01:52,721 --> 01:01:54,711
Anything else?
No, not much.

1035
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:57,780
Dietrichson's secretary says she
didn't know anything about the policy.

1036
01:01:57,859 --> 01:02:01,225
There's a daughter, but all she
remembers is Neff talking to her father...

1037
01:02:01,295 --> 01:02:03,524
about accident insurance
at their house one night.

1038
01:02:03,596 --> 01:02:04,960
I couldn't sell him at first.

1039
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:07,965
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

1040
01:02:08,033 --> 01:02:11,229
Later I saw him in the
oil fields and closed him.

1041
01:02:11,303 --> 01:02:13,327
He signed the application
and gave me his check.

1042
01:02:13,404 --> 01:02:15,803
A fine piece of salesmanship
that was, Mr. Neff.

1043
01:02:15,873 --> 01:02:17,499
Well, there's no sense in
pushing Neff around.

1044
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:19,540
He's got the best
sales record in the office.

1045
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:22,873
Are your salesmen supposed to know a
customer is going to fall off the train?

1046
01:02:22,945 --> 01:02:26,744
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?

1047
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:29,411
I don't get it.
You don't, Mr. Keyes?

1048
01:02:29,483 --> 01:02:30,972
Then what do you
think of this case?

1049
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:32,813
This policy might cost us
a great deal of money.

1050
01:02:32,886 --> 01:02:35,012
As you know, it contains
a double indemnity clause.

1051
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:36,850
Just what is your opinion?

1052
01:02:36,922 --> 01:02:38,650
No opinion at all.
Not even a hunch?

1053
01:02:38,724 --> 01:02:41,089
One of those interesting
little hunches of yours?

1054
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:42,489
Nope. Not even a hunch.

1055
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,256
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've
formed a very definite opinion.

1056
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:49,992
I think I know. In fact, I know I
know what happened to Dietrichson.

1057
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:53,432
You know you know what?
I know it was not an accident.

1058
01:02:56,805 --> 01:02:59,364
What do you say to that?
Me?

1059
01:03:00,741 --> 01:03:03,140
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

1060
01:03:03,209 --> 01:03:06,769
There's a widespread feeling that just
because a man has a large office...

1061
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:08,005
[intercom buzzing]

1062
01:03:09,848 --> 01:03:12,543
Yes? Have her come in, please.

1063
01:03:13,084 --> 01:03:14,641
There's a widespread
feeling that...

1064
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:18,017
just because a man has a large
office, he must be an idiot.

1065
01:03:18,088 --> 01:03:20,021
I'm having a visitor,
if you don't mind.

1066
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:23,058
No, no. I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

1067
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:24,751
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1068
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,363
Thank you very much
for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1069
01:03:31,431 --> 01:03:34,194
I assure you I appreciate
it. This is Mr. Keyes.

1070
01:03:34,267 --> 01:03:35,733
How do you do?
How do you do?

1071
01:03:35,801 --> 01:03:37,825
And Mr. Neff. I've met
Mr. Neff. How do you do?

1072
01:03:37,903 --> 01:03:40,462
Mrs. Dietrichson.
Won't you sit down?

1073
01:03:43,108 --> 01:03:44,938
(Norton) May I extend our
sympathy in your bereavement?

1074
01:03:45,009 --> 01:03:47,499
I hesitated before asking you to
come here so soon after your loss.

1075
01:03:47,578 --> 01:03:51,240
But now that you're here I hope you won't
mind if I plunge straight into business?

1076
01:03:51,314 --> 01:03:52,871
You know why we asked
you to come, don't you?

1077
01:03:52,948 --> 01:03:55,541
No. All I know is that your
secretary made it sound very urgent.

1078
01:03:55,617 --> 01:03:57,743
Your husband had an accident
policy with this company.

1079
01:03:57,818 --> 01:03:59,512
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1080
01:03:59,587 --> 01:04:02,316
No. I remember some talk at the
house, but he didn't seem to want it.

1081
01:04:02,389 --> 01:04:05,687
Your husband took the policy out
a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1082
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,249
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

1083
01:04:08,327 --> 01:04:10,089
His safe-deposit box
hasn't been opened yet.

1084
01:04:10,162 --> 01:04:12,152
It seems a tax examiner
has to be present.

1085
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:13,924
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

1086
01:04:13,998 --> 01:04:15,430
you're being subjected to
any questioning...

1087
01:04:15,499 --> 01:04:17,125
but there are a few things
we should like to know.

1088
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,223
What sort of things?

1089
01:04:18,635 --> 01:04:20,795
We have the report of
the coroner's inquest.

1090
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:23,929
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.

1091
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:26,599
In fact,
we are not satisfied at all.

1092
01:04:28,543 --> 01:04:31,170
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,
we suspect...

1093
01:04:32,413 --> 01:04:33,743
a suicide.

1094
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:40,516
I'm sorry. Would you like
a glass of water? Please.

1095
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:46,619
Thank you.

1096
01:04:52,594 --> 01:04:56,154
Had your husband been depressed
or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

1097
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:58,993
Did he have financial worries,
for instance?

1098
01:04:59,067 --> 01:05:02,399
He was perfectly all right and I
don't know of any financial worries.

1099
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:04,595
Let us examine this
so-called accident.

1100
01:05:04,671 --> 01:05:08,800
First, your husband takes out this
policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1101
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:11,875
Because he doesn't want his family
to suspect what he intends to do.

1102
01:05:11,943 --> 01:05:14,604
Do what? Next, he goes on
this trip entirely alone.

1103
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:18,272
He has to be alone. He hobbles all the
way out to the observation platform.

1104
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:22,010
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,
unless he has a very strong reason.

1105
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,344
Once there, he finds he is not
alone. There is a man there.

1106
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:29,150
What was his name, Keyes? His name
was Jackson. Probably still is.

1107
01:05:29,657 --> 01:05:33,353
So he gets rid of this Jackson with
some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1108
01:05:33,426 --> 01:05:36,724
And then he is alone. And
then he does it. Does what?

1109
01:05:36,796 --> 01:05:40,492
He jumps. Suicide. In which
case, the company is not liable.

1110
01:05:40,866 --> 01:05:43,732
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court...

1111
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:47,600
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.

1112
01:05:47,804 --> 01:05:51,102
Just a moment, please. I said we could
go to court. I didn't say we want to.

1113
01:05:51,173 --> 01:05:54,073
What I want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides.

1114
01:05:54,143 --> 01:05:56,610
A settlement for a certain
sum, a part of the policy value.

1115
01:05:56,678 --> 01:06:00,374
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in
here, I had no idea you owed me any money.

1116
01:06:00,447 --> 01:06:02,471
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

1117
01:06:02,549 --> 01:06:04,982
Now you tell me you want to pay
me a part of it, whatever it is.

1118
01:06:05,051 --> 01:06:07,382
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

1119
01:06:07,453 --> 01:06:10,819
I don't like your insinuations about my
husband, and I don't like your methods.

1120
01:06:10,889 --> 01:06:14,619
In fact, I don't like you,
Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.

1121
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:18,785
[Door slamming]

1122
01:06:19,429 --> 01:06:22,693
(Keyes) Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

1123
01:06:22,764 --> 01:06:24,128
Only you fumbled
on the goal line.

1124
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:27,395
Then you heaved an illegal forward
pass and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.

1125
01:06:27,468 --> 01:06:30,402
Now you can't pick yourself up because
you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1126
01:06:30,471 --> 01:06:33,496
I haven't, eh? She can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide.

1127
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:35,062
Oh, can we?

1128
01:06:35,142 --> 01:06:38,975
Mr. Norton, the first thing that
struck me was that suicide angle.

1129
01:06:39,044 --> 01:06:42,774
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later.

1130
01:06:42,847 --> 01:06:46,407
You know, you ought to take a look
at the statistics on suicide sometime.

1131
01:06:46,483 --> 01:06:48,950
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

1132
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:51,145
Mr. Keyes, I was raised
in the insurance business.

1133
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,982
Yeah, in the front office.

1134
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,217
Come now, you've never read an
actuarial table in your life, have you?

1135
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:58,554
Why, they've got 10 volumes
on suicide alone.

1136
01:06:58,627 --> 01:07:00,423
Suicide by race, by color,
by occupation...

1137
01:07:00,494 --> 01:07:02,484
by sex, by seasons of
the year, by time of day.

1138
01:07:02,563 --> 01:07:05,929
Suicide, how committed? By poisons,
by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.

1139
01:07:05,999 --> 01:07:08,660
Suicide by poison, subdivided
by types of poison...

1140
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:11,361
such as corrosive, irritant,
systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

1141
01:07:11,436 --> 01:07:12,902
alkaloid, protein,
and so forth.

1142
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:15,665
Suicide by leaps, subdivided
by leaps from high places...

1143
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,866
under the wheels of trains,
under the wheels of trucks...

1144
01:07:17,941 --> 01:07:21,205
under the feet of horses, from
steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...

1145
01:07:21,444 --> 01:07:24,970
of all the cases on record there's not
one single case of suicide by leap...

1146
01:07:25,047 --> 01:07:26,411
from the rear end
of a moving train.

1147
01:07:26,481 --> 01:07:28,243
And do you know how fast
that train was going...

1148
01:07:28,316 --> 01:07:31,284
at the point where the body
was found? 15 miles an hour.

1149
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:33,511
Now how can anybody jump off
a slow moving train like that...

1150
01:07:33,587 --> 01:07:36,453
with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself?

1151
01:07:36,522 --> 01:07:38,216
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

1152
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:41,384
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay
through the nose, and you know it.

1153
01:07:41,459 --> 01:07:43,050
May I have this?

1154
01:07:46,397 --> 01:07:47,988
Come on, Walter.

1155
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:53,328
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1156
01:08:09,782 --> 01:08:12,215
<i>(Walter) I could have hugged you
right then and there, Keyes...</i>

1157
01:08:12,283 --> 01:08:13,840
<i>you and your statistics.</i>

1158
01:08:13,918 --> 01:08:16,647
<i>You were the only one
we were really scared of...</i>

1159
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,449
<i>and instead you were
almost playing on our team.</i>

1160
01:08:19,656 --> 01:08:22,681
<i>That evening when I got home,
my nerves had eased off.</i>

1161
01:08:22,758 --> 01:08:24,782
<i>I could feel the ground
under my feet again.</i>

1162
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,657
<i>And it looked like easy going
from there on in.</i>

1163
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,992
<i>That $100,000 looked
as safe for Phyllis and me...</i>

1164
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,725
<i>as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank.</i>

1165

[Phone ringing]

1166
01:08:39,137 --> 01:08:43,539
Hello? Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.

1167
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:45,932
You were wonderful
in Norton's office.

1168
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:49,240
I felt so funny, I wanted to
look at you all the time.

1169
01:08:49,312 --> 01:08:51,836
How do you think I felt, baby?
Where are you?

1170
01:08:51,915 --> 01:08:54,508
At the drugstore.
Just a block away.

1171
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:56,842
Can I come up?
Okay. But be careful.

1172
01:08:56,919 --> 01:08:58,681
Don't let anybody see you.

1173
01:09:10,029 --> 01:09:11,723
[Doorbell ringing]

1174
01:09:24,973 --> 01:09:26,439
Hello, Keyes.

1175
01:09:32,113 --> 01:09:34,740
What's on your mind?
That broken leg.

1176
01:09:35,282 --> 01:09:38,375
The guy had a broken leg.
What are you talking about?

1177
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:41,976
Talking about Dietrichson. He
had accident insurance, didn't he?

1178
01:09:42,254 --> 01:09:44,312
Yeah. Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

1179
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,322
So what?
And he didn't put in a claim.

1180
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:50,156
Why didn't he put in a claim?
Why? What are you driving at?

1181
01:09:50,327 --> 01:09:55,126
Walter, I had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way.

1182
01:09:55,197 --> 01:09:56,891
That little man of yours
is acting up again, huh?

1183
01:09:56,965 --> 01:09:59,296
There's something wrong
with the Dietrichson case.

1184
01:09:59,367 --> 01:10:03,200
Why? Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.

1185
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:06,261
Maybe he just didn't know that
he was insured.

1186
01:10:08,441 --> 01:10:09,930
No. No, that couldn't be it.

1187
01:10:10,008 --> 01:10:12,202
You delivered the policy
to him personally, didn't you?

1188
01:10:12,277 --> 01:10:13,300
Yeah.
You got his check?

1189
01:10:13,378 --> 01:10:14,537
Sure I did.

1190
01:10:15,346 --> 01:10:18,280
Got any bicarbonate of soda?
No, I haven't.

1191
01:10:19,016 --> 01:10:22,678
Walter, I've been living with
this little man for 26 years.

1192
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,846
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

1193
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:28,354
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

1194
01:10:28,423 --> 01:10:30,014
No. Not suicide.

1195
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:33,684
But not an accident, either.
What else?

1196
01:10:34,227 --> 01:10:35,454
Now look, Walter.

1197
01:10:35,529 --> 01:10:38,497
A guy takes out an accident
policy that's worth $100,000...

1198
01:10:38,564 --> 01:10:39,621
if he's killed on a train.

1199
01:10:39,699 --> 01:10:41,598
Then two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

1200
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:45,659
And not in a train accident, mind you,
but falling off some silly observation car.

1201
01:10:45,737 --> 01:10:48,398
Do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is?

1202
01:10:48,472 --> 01:10:51,372
One out of I don't know
how many billions.

1203
01:10:52,141 --> 01:10:56,803
And add to that the broken leg. No,
it just can't be the way it looks.

1204
01:10:57,346 --> 01:11:01,372
Something has been worked
on us. Such as what?

1205
01:11:09,388 --> 01:11:10,581
Murder?

1206
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:12,954
Don't you have any peppermint
or something?

1207
01:11:13,025 --> 01:11:15,822
Sorry. Want a little
soda water? No, no, no.

1208
01:11:17,195 --> 01:11:18,183
(Walter)
Who do you suspect?

1209
01:11:18,261 --> 01:11:20,194
(Keyes) Maybe I like to
make things easy for myself.

1210
01:11:20,263 --> 01:11:22,287
But I always tend to suspect
the beneficiary.

1211
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:23,457
You mean the wife?
Yeah.

1212
01:11:23,532 --> 01:11:26,091
That wide-eyed dame that just
didn't know anything about anything.

1213
01:11:26,168 --> 01:11:28,192
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

1214
01:11:28,269 --> 01:11:29,530
I know she wasn't, Walter.

1215
01:11:29,604 --> 01:11:31,833
I don't claim to know how it
was worked, or who worked it...

1216
01:11:31,905 --> 01:11:34,338
but all I know is that
it was worked.

1217
01:11:34,408 --> 01:11:36,136
I've got to
get to a drugstore.

1218
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:39,178
This thing feels like
a hunk of concrete inside me.

1219
01:11:39,245 --> 01:11:41,940
Good night, Walter.
Good night, Keyes.

1220
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,214
See you at the office
in the morning. Yeah.

1221
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:48,843
I'd like to move in on her
right now, tonight.

1222
01:11:48,919 --> 01:11:53,082
If it wasn't for Norton and his
striped-pants ideas about company policy...

1223
01:11:53,156 --> 01:11:55,817
I'd have the police after her
so fast it'd make her head spin.

1224
01:11:55,891 --> 01:11:57,448
They'd put her
through the wringer...

1225
01:11:57,526 --> 01:12:00,358
and, brother, the things
they would squeeze out.

1226
01:12:00,428 --> 01:12:02,452
Only you haven't got a
single thing to go on, Keyes.

1227
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:04,827
Not too much.
Just 26 years experience...

1228
01:12:04,898 --> 01:12:09,129
all the percentage there is, and
this hunk of concrete in my stomach.

1229
01:12:11,303 --> 01:12:13,566
Can I have
one of those things?

1230
01:12:24,414 --> 01:12:26,904
Good night, Keyes.
So long, Walter.

1231

[Elevator door shuts]

1232
01:12:40,325 --> 01:12:43,521
How much does he know?
He doesn't know anything.

1233
01:12:44,163 --> 01:12:46,323
It's those stinking
hunches of his.

1234
01:12:46,397 --> 01:12:47,727
And he can't prove anything,
can he?

1235
01:12:47,799 --> 01:12:51,791
Not if we're careful. Not if we
don't see each other for a while.

1236
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:56,362
How long a while?
Until this dies down.

1237
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:57,427
You don't know Keyes.

1238
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,564
Once he gets his teeth into
something, he never lets go.

1239
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,335
He'll investigate you,
have you shadowed.

1240
01:13:01,409 --> 01:13:04,206
He'll watch you
every minute from now on.

1241
01:13:04,278 --> 01:13:06,768
You afraid, baby?
Yes, I'm afraid.

1242
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,838
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of
us. We're not the same anymore.

1243
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:15,079
We did it so we could be together, but
instead of that it's pulling us apart.

1244
01:13:15,153 --> 01:13:16,915
Isn't it, Walter?
What are you talking about?

1245
01:13:16,987 --> 01:13:20,683
And you don't really care
whether we see each other or not.

1246
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:23,647
Shut up, baby.

Hello.

Don't you remember me?
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:13:40,673 --> 01:13:42,867
Could I talk with you
just a few minutes?

1252
01:13:42,942 --> 01:13:45,375
Somewhere where
we could be alone?

1253
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:47,804
Oh, yes. Come into my office.

1254
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:56,310
Is it something about
what happened?

1255
01:13:56,385 --> 01:13:59,979
Yes, Mr. Neff.
It's about my father's death.

I'm terribly sorry,
Miss Dietrichson.

Lou, do you mind if I use the
office alone for a few minutes?

1258
01:14:09,062 --> 01:14:10,961
No. It's all yours, Walter.

1259
01:14:17,935 --> 01:14:19,492
Look at me, Mr. Neff.

1260
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:23,027
I'm not crazy. I'm not
hysterical. I'm not even crying.

1261
01:14:24,107 --> 01:14:27,564
But I have the awful feeling
that something is wrong...

1262
01:14:27,877 --> 01:14:31,676
and I had that same feeling
once before, when my mother died.

1263
01:14:31,746 --> 01:14:32,769
When your mother died?

1264
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:35,246
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.

1265
01:14:35,315 --> 01:14:36,303
We had a cabin there.

1266
01:14:36,383 --> 01:14:40,716
It was winter and very cold. My
mother was very sick with pneumonia.

1267
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,748
She had a nurse with her.

1268
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:45,845
There were just
the three of us in the cabin.

1269
01:14:45,957 --> 01:14:48,652
One night I got up and
went into my mother's room.

1270
01:14:48,726 --> 01:14:50,590
She was delirious with fever.

1271
01:14:50,661 --> 01:14:54,357
All the bed covers were on the
floor and the windows were wide open.

1272
01:14:54,464 --> 01:14:55,623
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1273
01:14:55,698 --> 01:14:57,892
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

1274
01:14:57,966 --> 01:15:00,695
Just then I heard
a door open behind me.

1275
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:03,199
The nurse stood there.

1276
01:15:03,738 --> 01:15:07,366
She didn't say a word, but
there was a look in her eyes...

1277
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:09,201
I'll never forget.

1278
01:15:11,277 --> 01:15:14,370
Two days later,
my mother was dead.

1279
01:15:17,682 --> 01:15:20,013
Do you know who
that nurse was?

1280
01:15:20,217 --> 01:15:21,877
No. Who?
Phyllis.

1281
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:24,717
I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then.

1282
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:27,949
He wouldn't listen to me. Six
months later she married him...

1283
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:32,426
and I kind of talked myself out of the
idea she could have done anything like that.

1284
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:36,953
But now it's all back again, now that
something's happened to my father, too.

1285
01:15:37,031 --> 01:15:40,864
You're not making sense, Miss
Dietrichson. Your father fell off a train.

1286
01:15:40,934 --> 01:15:43,959
Yes, and two days before he fell off
that train, what was Phyllis doing?

1287
01:15:44,036 --> 01:15:46,526
She was in her room in front of
a mirror, with a black hat on...

1288
01:15:46,604 --> 01:15:47,934
pinning a black veil to it.

1289
01:15:48,005 --> 01:15:51,405
As if she couldn't wait to see
how she would look in mourning.

1290
01:15:51,508 --> 01:15:53,532
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

1291
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:55,236
Aren't you just
imagining these things?

1292
01:15:55,345 --> 01:15:56,777
I caught her eyes
in the mirror.

1293
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:59,870
They had that look in them
they had before my mother died.

1294
01:15:59,949 --> 01:16:01,438
That same look.

1295
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:03,912
You don't like
your stepmother, do you?

1296
01:16:03,985 --> 01:16:05,815
Isn't it just because
she is your stepmother?

1297
01:16:05,886 --> 01:16:08,319
I loathe her because she did
it. She did it for the money.

1298
01:16:08,388 --> 01:16:10,719
Only you're not going to
pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

1299
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:13,917
She's not going to get away with it
this time, because I'm going to speak up.

1300
01:16:13,992 --> 01:16:15,481
I'm going to
tell everything I know.

1301
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:19,893
You'd better be careful, saying things
like... I'm not afraid. You'll see.

1302
01:16:20,965 --> 01:16:22,363
[Sobbing]

1303
01:16:28,203 --> 01:16:29,533
I'm sorry.

1304
01:16:32,907 --> 01:16:35,204
I didn't mean to
act like this.

1305
01:16:36,476 --> 01:16:39,535
All this that you've been telling
me, who else have you told?

1306
01:16:39,613 --> 01:16:40,806
No one.

1307
01:16:40,947 --> 01:16:43,437
How about your stepmother?
Of course not.

1308
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:45,939
I've moved out.

1309
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:49,177
I'm not living
at home anymore.

1310
01:16:49,253 --> 01:16:51,812
And you haven't told that
boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?

1311
01:16:51,888 --> 01:16:54,788
I'm not seeing him anymore.
We had a fight.

1312
01:16:56,392 --> 01:16:58,222
Where are you living now?

1313
01:16:58,294 --> 01:17:01,285
I got myself a little
apartment in Hollywood.

1314
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:04,531
Four walls, and you just
sit and look at them?

1315
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:06,888
Yes, Mr. Neff.

1316
01:17:09,736 --> 01:17:11,259
<i>(Walter) So that evening
I took her to dinner...</i>

1317
01:17:11,337 --> 01:17:14,999
<i>at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera
Street where nobody would see us.</i>

1318
01:17:15,073 --> 01:17:17,063
<i>I wanted to cheer her up.</i>

1319
01:17:17,475 --> 01:17:20,910
<i>The next day was Sunday and we
went for a ride down to the beach.</i>

1320
01:17:20,978 --> 01:17:23,707
<i>She had loosened up a bit,
she was even laughing.</i>

1321
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:27,340
<i>I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell
that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.</i>

1322
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:30,350
<i>It was dynamite,
whether it was true or not.</i>

1323
01:17:30,552 --> 01:17:32,382
<i>And I had no chance
to talk to Phyllis.</i>

1324
01:17:32,453 --> 01:17:34,647
<i>You were watching her
like a hawk, Keyes.</i>

1325
01:17:34,722 --> 01:17:39,055
<i>I couldn't even phone her because I
was afraid you had the wires tapped.</i>

1326
01:17:39,259 --> 01:17:43,251
<i>Monday morning there was a note on my
desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.</i>

1327
01:17:43,329 --> 01:17:46,297
<i>For a minute I wondered
if it could be about Lola.</i>

1328
01:17:46,364 --> 01:17:47,830
<i>It was worse.</i>

1329
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,358
<i>Outside your door was the last
guy in the world I wanted to see.</i>

1330
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,500
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1331
01:18:05,012 --> 01:18:07,912
Hello, Keyes.
I want to ask you something.

1332
01:18:08,348 --> 01:18:10,212
After all the years
we've known each other...

1333
01:18:10,283 --> 01:18:12,216
do you mind if I make
a rather blunt statement?

1334
01:18:12,284 --> 01:18:13,875
About what?
About me.

1335
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:17,147
Walter, I'm a very great man.
Yeah?

1336
01:18:17,221 --> 01:18:19,984
This Dietrichson business,
it's murder...

1337
01:18:20,058 --> 01:18:22,048
and murders don't come
any neater.

1338
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:24,991
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into...

1339
01:18:25,062 --> 01:18:27,325
smart, tricky,
almost perfect, but...

1340
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:30,697
I think Papa has it
all figured out.

1341
01:18:30,765 --> 01:18:34,598
Figured out and wrapped up in
tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.

1342
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,397
Go ahead. I'm listening.
You know what?

1343
01:18:37,771 --> 01:18:40,705
That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train.

1344
01:18:41,874 --> 01:18:43,898
He wasn't?
No, he wasn't.

1345
01:18:45,477 --> 01:18:47,774
Now look, Walter. You can't
be sure of killing a man...

1346
01:18:47,846 --> 01:18:50,973
by throwing him off a train
that's going 15 miles an hour.

1347
01:18:51,048 --> 01:18:53,515
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

1348
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:55,516
and then throw
his body on the tracks.

1349
01:18:55,585 --> 01:18:57,779
Now that would mean either
killing him on the train...

1350
01:18:57,853 --> 01:19:01,583
or, and this is where it really gets
fancy, you kill him somewhere else...

1351
01:19:01,657 --> 01:19:02,850
and put him on the tracks.

1352
01:19:02,924 --> 01:19:06,188
Two possibilities, and I
personally buy the second.

1353
01:19:07,427 --> 01:19:08,950
You're way ahead of me,
Keyes.

1354
01:19:09,062 --> 01:19:10,824
Well, look, Walter,
it was like this.

1355
01:19:11,097 --> 01:19:14,759
They killed the guy, the wife
and a somebody else...

1356
01:19:15,034 --> 01:19:18,434
and the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as Dietrichson...

1357
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:20,265
then the somebody
else jumped off...

1358
01:19:20,337 --> 01:19:22,896
then they put the body on the
tracks where the train had passed.

1359
01:19:22,973 --> 01:19:25,634
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.

1360
01:19:26,442 --> 01:19:28,568
Because it was night,
very few people were about...

1361
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:30,167
they have the crutches
to stare at...

1362
01:19:30,245 --> 01:19:32,712
they never really looked
at the man at all.

1363
01:19:32,781 --> 01:19:34,941
Fancy all right, Keyes, but
maybe it's a little too fancy.

1364
01:19:35,015 --> 01:19:38,381
Is it? I tell you, it all
fits together like a watch.

1365
01:19:39,052 --> 01:19:40,951
Now let's see what we have
in the way of proof.

1366
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:43,920
The only guy who really got a good
look at this supposed Dietrichson...

1367
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:46,115
is sitting
right outside my office.

1368
01:19:46,191 --> 01:19:49,626
I took the trouble to bring
him down here from Oregon.

1369
01:19:51,362 --> 01:19:54,194
Come here, Mr. Jackson.
Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

1370
01:19:54,297 --> 01:19:55,957
These are fine cigars
you smoke.

1371
01:19:56,032 --> 01:19:57,760
Two for a quarter.
That's what I said.

1372
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:59,390
Well, did you study
those photographs?

1373
01:19:59,468 --> 01:20:01,492
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly.

1374
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:03,399
Very thoroughly.
Have you made up your mind?

1375
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:05,461
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford
man. Medford, Oregon.

1376
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:07,700
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our mind.

1377
01:20:07,775 --> 01:20:10,800
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

1378
01:20:10,877 --> 01:20:13,106
Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

1379
01:20:13,179 --> 01:20:14,167
Yes.

1380
01:20:14,713 --> 01:20:16,907
Then my answer is no.
What do you mean, no?

1381
01:20:16,982 --> 01:20:19,176
I mean, this is not
the man that was on the train.

1382
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:20,443
Will you swear to that?

1383
01:20:20,518 --> 01:20:22,508
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1384
01:20:22,586 --> 01:20:24,951
If I say it, I mean it. If I
mean it, of course I'll swear it.

1385
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:26,647
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.

1386
01:20:26,723 --> 01:20:28,383
This is Mr. Neff,
one of our salesmen.

1387
01:20:28,457 --> 01:20:30,447
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
Pleased, indeed.

1388
01:20:30,526 --> 01:20:31,890
How are you?
Very fine, thank you.

1389
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,325
Never was better.
Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1390
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:37,761
Just how would you describe the man
you saw on the observation platform?

1391
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:40,560
Well, I'm pretty sure
he was a younger man...

1392
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:43,635
about 10 or 15 years younger
than the man in these photographs.

1393
01:20:43,702 --> 01:20:45,726
Dietrichson was about 50,
wasn't he, Walter?

1394
01:20:45,805 --> 01:20:48,204
Fifty-one,
according to the policy.

1395
01:20:48,273 --> 01:20:51,139
The man I saw was nothing like
51 years old.

1396
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:53,865
Of course, it was pretty dark
out on that platform.

1397
01:20:53,944 --> 01:20:56,207
Come to think of it, he tried
to keep his back towards me.

1398
01:20:56,279 --> 01:20:58,906
But I'm positive just the
same. Thank you, Jackson.

1399
01:20:58,981 --> 01:21:01,414
Of course, you understand this
matter is strictly confidential?

1400
01:21:01,483 --> 01:21:04,576
We may need you again down here in Los
Angeles, if the case comes to court.

1401
01:21:04,653 --> 01:21:07,416
Any time you need me, I'm entirely
at your disposal, gentlemen.

1402
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:10,786
Expenses paid, of course.
Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

1403
01:21:12,358 --> 01:21:14,985
Get me Lubin,
in the cashier's office.

1404
01:21:15,661 --> 01:21:17,719
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1405
01:21:17,796 --> 01:21:21,891
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson
down to you with an expense account.

1406
01:21:21,966 --> 01:21:24,763
Well, we brought him down here from
Medford, Oregon in connection with...

1407
01:21:24,835 --> 01:21:26,597
the Dietrichson claim.

1408
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:29,796
Well, take care of his
hotel bill, will you?

1409
01:21:29,872 --> 01:21:30,963
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

1410
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,063
(Keyes)
Yeah. He'll be right down.

1411
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:33,663
No. Never been up there.

1412
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:36,468
Wait a minute.
You go trout fishing?

1413
01:21:36,543 --> 01:21:40,205
Maybe I saw you up Klamath
Falls way. Nope. I don't fish.

1414
01:21:40,514 --> 01:21:43,812
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1415
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:46,943
There's a family of Neffs
in Corvallis. No relation.

1416
01:21:47,018 --> 01:21:49,417
Let me see. This man's an
automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1417
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:51,818
A very reputable man, too, I'm
told. All right, Mr. Jackson.

1418
01:21:51,889 --> 01:21:53,412
Suppose you go down to
the cashier's office.

1419
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:54,956
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

1420
01:21:55,024 --> 01:21:58,322
He'll take care of your expense account
and your ticket for the train tonight.

1421
01:21:58,394 --> 01:21:59,382
Tonight?

1422
01:21:59,494 --> 01:22:02,724
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town...

1423
01:22:02,798 --> 01:22:05,595
I'd like to see before
I leave. Osteopath?

1424
01:22:06,133 --> 01:22:09,192
Well, just don't put her
on the expense account.

1425
01:22:10,103 --> 01:22:11,626
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

1426
01:22:11,705 --> 01:22:14,002
It's been a pleasure.
Goodbye.

1427
01:22:16,308 --> 01:22:20,243
There it is, Walter. It's beginning
to come apart at the seams already.

1428
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:23,040
Murder's never perfect. Always
comes apart sooner or later.

1429
01:22:23,113 --> 01:22:25,580
And when two people are
involved, it's usually sooner.

1430
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,549
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame
is in it, and a somebody else.

1431
01:22:28,618 --> 01:22:30,642
Pretty soon we'll know
who that somebody else is.

1432
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,586
He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime,
somewhere, they've got to meet.

1433
01:22:33,655 --> 01:22:34,951
Their emotions
are all kicked up.

1434
01:22:35,023 --> 01:22:38,458
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.

1435
01:22:38,525 --> 01:22:40,992
They may think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

1436
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,458
But it isn't twice as safe.

1437
01:22:42,528 --> 01:22:45,690
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder...

1438
01:22:45,764 --> 01:22:47,890
and it's not like taking
a trolley ride together...

1439
01:22:47,966 --> 01:22:49,728
where they can get off
at different stops.

1440
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,063
They're stuck with each other
and they've got to ride...

1441
01:22:52,136 --> 01:22:53,602
all the way to
the end of the line.

1442
01:22:53,671 --> 01:22:56,002
And it's a one-way trip, and
the last stop is the cemetery.

1443
01:22:56,072 --> 01:22:57,868
She put in her claim.

1444
01:22:58,507 --> 01:23:01,100
I'm gonna throw it
right back at her.

1445
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:08,443
Let her sue us if she dares.

1446
01:23:08,515 --> 01:23:11,312
I'll be ready for her
and that somebody else.

1447
01:23:11,385 --> 01:23:13,909
They'll be digging
their own graves.

1448
01:23:22,359 --> 01:23:25,020
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.

1449
01:23:25,095 --> 01:23:28,086
We just got in a shipment of that
English soap you were asking about.

1450
01:23:28,164 --> 01:23:31,724
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1451
01:23:58,788 --> 01:24:01,415
Hello, Walter.
Come over here.

1452
01:24:05,126 --> 01:24:08,060
What's the matter?
Everything's the matter.

1453
01:24:10,097 --> 01:24:11,427
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1454
01:24:11,497 --> 01:24:14,090
He's sitting back with his mouth
watering, waiting for you to sue.

1455
01:24:14,167 --> 01:24:15,963
He wants you to sue,
but you're not going to.

1456
01:24:16,034 --> 01:24:18,934
What's he got to stop me?
He's got plenty.

1457
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:23,170
He's figured out how
it was worked.

1458
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,036
He knows it was somebody else
on the train...

1459
01:24:25,108 --> 01:24:26,938
and he's dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it.

1460
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:29,375
Prove it how? If he rejects
that claim, I have to sue.

1461
01:24:29,445 --> 01:24:32,936
Yeah? And then you're in court and a
lot of other things are going to come up.

1462
01:24:33,015 --> 01:24:36,848
Like, for instance, about you
and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1463
01:24:37,018 --> 01:24:38,848
What about me and
the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

1464
01:24:38,919 --> 01:24:39,942
The way she died.

1465
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:43,045
And about that black hat you were
trying on before you needed a black hat.

1466
01:24:43,122 --> 01:24:44,884
Lola's been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories.

1467
01:24:44,957 --> 01:24:47,288
She's been seeing you. I've been
seeing her, if you want to know.

1468
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,054
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

1469
01:24:49,127 --> 01:24:51,856
She's putting on an act for you, crying
all over your shoulder, the lying...

1470
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:54,261
Keep her out of this. All I'm
telling you is we're not going to sue.

1471
01:24:54,331 --> 01:24:55,524
Because you don't want
the money anymore...

1472
01:24:55,599 --> 01:24:56,792
even if you could have it,
because she's...

1473
01:24:56,866 --> 01:24:58,059
made you feel like
a heel all of a sudden?

1474
01:24:58,134 --> 01:25:01,398
It isn't the money anymore. It's our
necks. We're pulling out, do you understand?

1475
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:04,404
Because of what Keyes can do?
You're not fooling me, Walter.

1476
01:25:04,473 --> 01:25:06,736
It's because of Lola,
what you did to her father.

1477
01:25:06,807 --> 01:25:09,673
You're afraid she might find out
someday and you can't take it, can you?

1478
01:25:09,744 --> 01:25:11,677
I said, leave her out of this.

1479
01:25:16,648 --> 01:25:17,909
It's me I'm talking about.

1480
01:25:17,983 --> 01:25:20,143
I don't want to be left
out of it. Stop saying that.

1481
01:25:20,218 --> 01:25:21,616
It's just that it
hasn't worked as we wanted.

1482
01:25:21,686 --> 01:25:24,313
We can't go through with it, that's
all. We have gone through with it.

1483
01:25:24,388 --> 01:25:25,479
The tough part
is all behind us.

1484
01:25:25,589 --> 01:25:28,056
We just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside...

1485
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:30,856
stick close together
the way we started out.

1486
01:25:30,926 --> 01:25:32,187
Watch it.

1487
01:25:49,975 --> 01:25:52,568
I loved you, Walter,
and I hated him.

1488
01:25:52,643 --> 01:25:56,134
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

1489
01:25:56,212 --> 01:25:59,840
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.

1490
01:26:00,416 --> 01:26:03,077
And I'm the one that
fixed it so he was dead.

1491
01:26:03,152 --> 01:26:06,848
Is that what you're telling
me? And nobody's pulling out.

1492
01:26:07,021 --> 01:26:09,580
We went into this together, we're
coming out at the end together.

1493
01:26:09,656 --> 01:26:13,386
It's straight down the line
for both of us, remember?

1494
01:26:20,098 --> 01:26:21,758
<i>(Walter)
Yes, I remembered.</i>

1495
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,398
<i>Just like I remembered
what you had told me, Keyes...</i>

1496
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:28,937
<i>about that trolley car ride...</i>

1497
01:26:29,005 --> 01:26:31,404
<i>and how there was no getting
off till the end of the line...</i>

1498
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:34,940
...where the cemetery was.

1499
01:26:36,378 --> 01:26:39,642
And then I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

1500
01:26:40,314 --> 01:26:42,543
They're to put dead people in.

1501
01:26:44,284 --> 01:26:47,946
I guess that was the first time I
ever thought about Phyllis that way.

1502
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:49,543
Dead, I mean.

1503
01:26:50,721 --> 01:26:53,314
And how it would be
if she were dead.

1504
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:57,422
<i>I saw Lola three or four times
that week.</i>

1505
01:26:58,095 --> 01:27:01,928
<i>One night we went up into the
hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.</i>

1506
01:27:02,131 --> 01:27:04,963
<i>I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it was only with her that...</i>

1507
01:27:05,033 --> 01:27:07,466
<i>I could relax
and let go a little.</i>

1508
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:39,353
Why are you crying?

1509
01:27:41,261 --> 01:27:43,490
Not gonna tell me, huh?

1510
01:27:43,663 --> 01:27:47,564
Of course I will, Walter. I
wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

1511
01:27:48,801 --> 01:27:51,701
It's about Nino.
Zachetti? What about him?

1512
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:54,736
They killed my father
together. He and Phyllis.

1513
01:27:54,805 --> 01:27:57,295
He helped her do it.
I know he did.

1514
01:27:58,108 --> 01:28:00,075
What makes you say that?

1515
01:28:00,476 --> 01:28:03,774
I've been following him. He's been
to her house, night after night.

1516
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:06,244
It was Phyllis
and him all along.

1517
01:28:06,515 --> 01:28:10,575
Maybe he was just going with me as a
blind. And the night of the murder...

1518
01:28:10,651 --> 01:28:12,743
You promised me you weren't
gonna talk like this anymore.

1519
01:28:12,819 --> 01:28:16,345
He was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at UCLA.

1520
01:28:16,422 --> 01:28:19,322
But he never showed up.
He said he was sick.

1521
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:21,216
Sick!

1522
01:28:21,292 --> 01:28:22,690
[Sobbing]

1523
01:28:23,294 --> 01:28:27,696
He couldn't show up, because the
train was leaving with my father on it.

1524
01:28:33,302 --> 01:28:36,600
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all in my mind.

1525
01:28:37,639 --> 01:28:39,663
Sure, it's all in your mind.

1526
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:43,835
I only wish it were, Walter,
'cause I still love him.

1527
01:28:50,215 --> 01:28:53,615
<i>(Walter) Zachetti. Phyllis and Zachetti.</i>

1528
01:28:55,319 --> 01:28:59,379
<i>What was he doing up at her house?
I couldn't figure that one out.</i>

1529
01:29:01,024 --> 01:29:04,117
<i>I tried to make sense
out of it and got nowhere.</i>

1530
01:29:04,626 --> 01:29:07,617
<i>But the real braintwister
came the next day.</i>

1531
01:29:08,095 --> 01:29:12,190
<i>You sprang it on me, Keyes, after
office hours, when you caught me...</i>

1532
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:14,164
<i>down in the lobby
of the building.</i>

1533
01:29:14,234 --> 01:29:16,463
Walter. Walter, just a minute.

1534
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:24,130
Hello, Keyes. Just hang
on to your hat, Walter.

1535
01:29:24,209 --> 01:29:26,176
What for?
Oh, nothing much.

1536
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:29,310
That Dietrichson case
just busted wide open.

1537
01:29:29,579 --> 01:29:32,604
How do you mean?
The guy showed. That's how.

1538
01:29:33,816 --> 01:29:36,045
What guy?
The guy who helped her do it.

1539
01:29:36,117 --> 01:29:37,811
The somebody else?

1540
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:41,414
No kidding? Yeah. She
just filed suit against us.

1541
01:29:41,488 --> 01:29:42,784
It's okay by me.

1542
01:29:42,856 --> 01:29:45,915
When we get them in that courtroom,
I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.

1543
01:29:45,992 --> 01:29:48,221
Come on. I'll buy you a martini,
Walter. No thanks, Keyes.

1544
01:29:48,293 --> 01:29:49,281
With two olives.

1545
01:29:49,361 --> 01:29:51,658
No, I've got to get a shave and
a shoeshine. I've got a date.

1546
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:54,823
Margie. I still bet she drinks
from the bottle.

1547
01:29:55,433 --> 01:29:57,161
They give you matches
when you buy cigars, you know.

1548
01:29:57,234 --> 01:29:58,530
All you have to do is
ask for them.

1549
01:29:58,602 --> 01:30:02,731
Don't like them, they always explode
in my pocket. So long, Walter.

1550
01:30:07,075 --> 01:30:09,099
<i>(Walter)
I was scared stiff, Keyes.</i>

1551
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:12,242
<i>Maybe you were playing
cat-and-mouse with me.</i>

1552
01:30:12,312 --> 01:30:15,474
<i>Maybe you knew all along
I was the somebody else.</i>

1553
01:30:15,881 --> 01:30:20,078
<i>I had to find out, and I knew
where to look. In your office.</i>

1554
01:30:52,644 --> 01:30:54,133
<i>(Keyes on dictation machine)
Memo to Mr. Norton.</i>

1555
01:30:54,212 --> 01:30:55,872
<i>Confidential.
Dietrichson file.</i>

1556
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:59,443
<i>With regard to your proposal to put
Walter Neff under surveillance...</i>

1557
01:30:59,516 --> 01:31:01,210
<i>I disagree absolutely.</i>

1558
01:31:01,284 --> 01:31:03,649
<i>I have investigated his movements
on the night of the crime...</i>

1559
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:07,552
<i>and he's definitely placed in
his apartment from 7:15 p. m. On.</i>

1560
01:31:08,156 --> 01:31:11,591
<i>In addition to this, I have known
Neff intimately for 11 years...</i>

1561
01:31:11,659 --> 01:31:14,957
<i>and I personally vouch for him
without reservation.</i>

1562

1563
01:31:19,598 --> 01:31:20,621

1564
01:31:20,699 --> 01:31:23,599
<i>Furthermore, no connection
whatsoever has been established...</i>

1565
01:31:23,668 --> 01:31:26,033
<i>between Walter Neff and
Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

1566
01:31:26,103 --> 01:31:29,902
<i>whereas I am now able to report that
such a connection has been established...</i>

1567
01:31:29,973 --> 01:31:32,099
<i>between her and another man.</i>

1568
01:31:32,274 --> 01:31:35,140
<i>This man has been observed
to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

1569
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:38,576
<i>on the nights of July 9th,
10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.</i>

1570
01:31:39,314 --> 01:31:43,044
<i>We have succeeded in identifying
him as one Nino Zachetti...</i>

1571
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:45,640
<i>former medical student,
age of 28...</i>

1572

<i>residing at

<i>12281/2 North La Brea Avenue.</i>

1574
01:31:51,489 --> 01:31:54,946
<i>We have checked Zachetti's movements
on the night of the crime...</i>

1575
01:31:55,025 --> 01:31:57,822
<i>and have found that
they cannot be accounted for.</i>

1576
01:31:58,262 --> 01:32:01,492
<i>I am preparing a more detailed
report for your consideration.</i>

1577
01:32:01,564 --> 01:32:05,260
<i>It is my belief that we already have
sufficient evidence against Zachetti...</i>

1578
01:32:05,334 --> 01:32:08,393
<i>and Mrs. Dietrichson
to justify police action.</i>

1579
01:32:08,669 --> 01:32:11,660
<i>I strongly urge that this whole
matter be turned over to the office...</i>

1580
01:32:11,739 --> 01:32:13,672
<i>of the district attorney.</i>

1581

[Buzzing stops]

1584
01:32:52,003 --> 01:32:55,733
Phyllis? It's Walter.
I've got to see you. Tonight.

1585
01:32:57,174 --> 01:32:59,198
Yes, it has to be tonight.

1586
01:32:59,809 --> 01:33:01,207
How's 11:00?

1587
01:33:02,379 --> 01:33:04,175
Don't worry about Keyes.

1588
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:07,214
Just leave the front door
unlocked and put the lights out.

1589
01:33:07,282 --> 01:33:10,216
No, nobody's watching
the house. Not anymore.

1590
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:14,777
It's just for the neighbors. I
told you not to worry about Keyes.

1591
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:18,756
I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah.

1592
01:33:20,559 --> 01:33:22,048
Goodbye, baby.

don't have to tell you...</i>

1594
01:33:27,798 --> 01:33:30,459
<i>what I intended to do
at 11:00, Keyes.</i>

1595
01:33:30,533 --> 01:33:34,093
<i>For the first time, I saw a way to
get clear of the whole mess I was in...</i>

1596
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:37,002
<i>and of Phyllis, too,
all at the same time.</i>

1597
01:33:37,339 --> 01:33:39,465
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought.</i>

1598
01:33:40,107 --> 01:33:43,473
<i>What I didn't know was that
she had plans of her own.</i>

1599

[Car approaching]

1600
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:29,233
[Car door closing]

1601
01:34:42,957 --> 01:34:44,548
In here, Walter.

1602
01:34:48,127 --> 01:34:49,991
<i>[Jazz music playing]</i>

1603
01:34:59,403 --> 01:35:00,801
Hello, baby.

1604
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:05,734
Anybody else in the house?
Nobody. Why?

1605
01:35:07,275 --> 01:35:10,175
What's that music?
A radio up the street.

1606
01:35:18,685 --> 01:35:21,619
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?

1607
01:35:21,687 --> 01:35:24,519
We were talking about
automobile insurance.

1608
01:35:24,889 --> 01:35:27,413
Only you were thinking
about murder.

1609
01:35:28,493 --> 01:35:30,392
I was thinking about
that anklet.

1610
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,324
And what are you
thinking about now?

1611
01:35:32,395 --> 01:35:34,692
I'm all through thinking,
baby.

1612
01:35:34,897 --> 01:35:37,160
I just came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?

1613
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:41,391
Where are you going? You're the
one that's going, baby. Not me.

1614
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:44,262
I'm getting off the trolley
car right at this corner.

1615
01:35:44,338 --> 01:35:46,828
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

1616
01:35:46,906 --> 01:35:50,341
All right, I'll tell you. A friend
of mine's got a funny theory.

1617
01:35:50,743 --> 01:35:53,711
He says when two people commit a murder,
it's sort of like they're riding...

1618
01:35:53,778 --> 01:35:56,405
on a trolley car together. One
can't get off without the other.

1619
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,777
They're stuck with each other
and they have to go on...

1620
01:35:58,849 --> 01:36:01,146
riding together
clear to the end of the line.

1621
01:36:01,217 --> 01:36:03,514
And the last stop
is the cemetery.

1622
01:36:03,586 --> 01:36:06,748
Maybe he's got something
there. You bet he has.

1623
01:36:06,855 --> 01:36:09,584
Two people are gonna ride to
the end of the line, all right.

1624
01:36:09,657 --> 01:36:14,093
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've
got another guy to finish my ride for me.

1625
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:17,617
Just who are you talking
about? An acquaintance of yours.

1626
01:36:17,697 --> 01:36:19,027
A Mr. Zachetti.

1627
01:36:19,098 --> 01:36:20,894
Come on, baby,
I just got into this thing...

1628
01:36:20,966 --> 01:36:23,593
because I happen to know a little
something about insurance, didn't I?

1629
01:36:23,668 --> 01:36:24,691
I was a sucker.

1630
01:36:24,769 --> 01:36:27,532
I'd have been brushed off just as soon
as you got your hands on the money.

1631
01:36:27,605 --> 01:36:30,266
Nobody wanted to brush you
off. Save it. I'm telling this.

1632
01:36:30,707 --> 01:36:32,765
It's been you and that Zachetti
guy all along, hasn't it?

1633
01:36:32,842 --> 01:36:34,433
That's not true.

1634
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:37,637
Doesn't make any difference
if it's true or not.

1635
01:36:38,914 --> 01:36:42,405
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti
is the one he's been looking for.

1636
01:36:42,483 --> 01:36:45,542
He'll have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what's happened to him.

1637
01:36:45,619 --> 01:36:48,985
What's happening to me all
this time? Don't be silly, baby.

1638
01:36:54,259 --> 01:36:58,422
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

1639
01:36:58,496 --> 01:36:59,792
That's what Keyes thinks.

1640
01:36:59,863 --> 01:37:02,126
And what's good enough for
Keyes is good enough for me.

1641
01:37:02,198 --> 01:37:06,531
Maybe it's not good enough for me,
Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1642
01:37:06,602 --> 01:37:08,466
Maybe I'd rather talk.

1643
01:37:08,604 --> 01:37:13,097
Sometimes people are where they can't
talk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1644
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:17,466
And if it was you, they'd charge that
up to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?

1645
01:37:17,544 --> 01:37:21,240
Sure they would, and that's
just what's gonna happen, baby.

1646
01:37:21,681 --> 01:37:24,171
'Cause he's coming here
tonight, in about 15 minutes.

1647
01:37:24,249 --> 01:37:27,706
With the cops right behind
him. It's all taken care of.

1648
01:37:28,819 --> 01:37:31,082
That would make everything
lovely for you, wouldn't it?

1649
01:37:31,155 --> 01:37:35,056
Right. And it's got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial...

1650
01:37:35,124 --> 01:37:36,590
and Lola gets a chance
to sound off...

1651
01:37:36,825 --> 01:37:39,884
before they trip you up on the stand, and
you start to go in drag me down with you.

1652
01:37:39,962 --> 01:37:42,293
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they
won't get a chance to trip me up...

1653
01:37:42,363 --> 01:37:43,795
so we can get the money
and be together.

1654
01:37:44,198 --> 01:37:47,325
That's cute. Say it again. He came
here first to ask where Lola was.

1655
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,458
I made him come back.
I was working on him.

1656
01:37:49,536 --> 01:37:51,526
He's a crazy sort of guy,
quick-tempered.

1657
01:37:51,604 --> 01:37:53,798
I kept hammering into him that
she was with another man...

1658
01:37:53,872 --> 01:37:58,274
so he'd go into one of his jealous rages,
and then I'd tell him where she was.

1659
01:37:58,343 --> 01:38:01,038
And you know what he would've
done to her, don't you, Walter?

1660
01:38:01,111 --> 01:38:05,171
Yeah, and for once I believe you,
because it's just rotten enough.

1661
01:38:06,048 --> 01:38:07,708
We're both rotten.

1662
01:38:07,816 --> 01:38:09,476
Only you're
a little more rotten.

1663
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:11,643
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

1664
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:15,246
and then you got Zachetti to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.

1665
01:38:15,322 --> 01:38:18,381
Then somebody else would have come
along to take care of Zachetti for you.

1666
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:21,153
That's the way you operate,
isn't it, baby? Suppose it is.

1667
01:38:21,227 --> 01:38:24,525
Is what you've got cooked up
for tonight any better?

1668
01:38:25,364 --> 01:38:29,060
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?

1669
01:38:44,811 --> 01:38:46,175
[Gun fires]

1670
01:38:49,348 --> 01:38:52,282
You can do better than that,
can't you, baby?

1671
01:38:52,518 --> 01:38:54,280
Better try it again.

1672
01:38:57,055 --> 01:38:59,386
Maybe if I came
a little closer?

1673
01:39:09,898 --> 01:39:12,388
How's this?
Think you can do it now?

1674
01:39:21,407 --> 01:39:23,806
Why didn't you
shoot again, baby?

1675
01:39:29,514 --> 01:39:33,472
Don't tell me it's because you've
been in love with me all this time.

1676
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:37,007
No, I never loved you, Walter,
not you or anybody else.

1677
01:39:37,253 --> 01:39:40,483
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

1678
01:39:40,555 --> 01:39:42,988
That's all you
ever meant to me...

1679
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:45,886
until a minute ago...

1680
01:39:47,027 --> 01:39:49,654
when I couldn't fire
that second shot.

1681
01:39:51,264 --> 01:39:53,993
I never thought
that could happen to me.

1682
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,559
Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
I'm not asking you to buy.

1683
01:39:57,635 --> 01:39:59,363
Just hold me close.

1684
01:40:05,809 --> 01:40:07,298
Goodbye, baby.

1685
01:40:07,476 --> 01:40:09,238
[Gun fires twice]

1686
01:41:01,918 --> 01:41:03,179
Zachetti.

1687
01:41:05,354 --> 01:41:06,684
Come here.

1688
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,220
I said, come here.

1689
01:41:16,964 --> 01:41:19,989
My name is Neff. Yeah,
and I still don't like it.

1690
01:41:20,066 --> 01:41:21,692
What do you want?

1691
01:41:21,768 --> 01:41:23,064
Look, kid.

1692
01:41:24,236 --> 01:41:27,500
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.

1693
01:41:27,672 --> 01:41:29,730
What's the gag? Suppose you
go on back down the hill...

1694
01:41:29,807 --> 01:41:31,398
to the drugstore
and make a phone call.

1695
01:41:31,475 --> 01:41:33,567
Keep your nickel and buy
yourself an ice-cream cone.

1696
01:41:33,643 --> 01:41:35,405
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

1697
01:41:35,478 --> 01:41:38,037
Ask for Miss Dietrichson.
First name is Lola.

1698
01:41:38,113 --> 01:41:39,204
She isn't worth a nickel.

1699
01:41:39,281 --> 01:41:41,771
If I ever talk to her, it's not
going to be over any telephone.

1700
01:41:41,849 --> 01:41:42,872
Tough, aren't you?

1701
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:44,974
Here, take the nickel and
call her. She wants you to.

1702
01:41:45,052 --> 01:41:46,814
She doesn't want
any part of me.

1703
01:41:47,087 --> 01:41:49,646
I know who told you that.
It's not true.

1704
01:41:49,723 --> 01:41:52,247
Lola's in love with you.
She always has been.

1705
01:41:52,324 --> 01:41:54,553
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.

1706
01:41:54,627 --> 01:41:57,891
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.

1707
01:41:58,563 --> 01:42:00,154
Go on. That way.

1708
01:42:10,405 --> 01:42:12,565
(Walter)
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1709
01:42:13,941 --> 01:42:14,998
It's cold.

1710
01:42:17,077 --> 01:42:20,671
I wonder if she's still lying
alone up there in that house...

1711
01:42:20,747 --> 01:42:22,873
or if they've found her
by now.

1712
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:27,848
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.

1713
01:42:28,853 --> 01:42:30,319
[Coughing]

1714
01:42:32,122 --> 01:42:35,113
Except I want you to do
a favor for me, Keyes.

1715
01:42:35,992 --> 01:42:40,927
I want you to be the one to tell Lola,
kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.

1716
01:42:42,597 --> 01:42:46,293
And I want you to take care
of her and that guy Zachetti...

1717
01:42:50,903 --> 01:42:53,700
so he doesn't get
pushed around too much.

1718
01:42:55,674 --> 01:42:57,140
Hello, Keyes.

1719
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:09,209
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1720
01:43:10,652 --> 01:43:13,984
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

1721
01:43:14,722 --> 01:43:17,884
Or did that little man of
yours pull you out of bed?

1722
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:19,549
The janitor did.

1723
01:43:20,393 --> 01:43:23,020
Seems you leaked a little
blood on the way in here.

1724
01:43:23,095 --> 01:43:24,186
Yeah.

1725
01:43:24,663 --> 01:43:26,527
Wouldn't be surprised.

1726
01:43:27,966 --> 01:43:31,526
I wanted to straighten you out
on that Dietrichson case.

1727
01:43:31,902 --> 01:43:33,300
So I gather.

1728
01:43:34,972 --> 01:43:38,338
How long have you been
standing there? Long enough.

1729
01:43:38,407 --> 01:43:41,398
Kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it.

1730
01:43:42,310 --> 01:43:44,300
One you didn't
quite figure out.

1731
01:43:44,378 --> 01:43:46,811
You can't figure them all,
Walter.

1732
01:43:47,448 --> 01:43:50,177
That's right.
I guess you can't at that.

1733
01:43:51,451 --> 01:43:54,044
Now I suppose
I get the big speech...

1734
01:43:55,087 --> 01:43:58,021
the one with all the
two-dollar words in it.

1735
01:43:59,223 --> 01:44:01,019
Let's have it, Keyes.

1736
01:44:02,392 --> 01:44:05,588
Walter, you're all washed up.

1737
01:44:08,197 --> 01:44:10,721
Thanks, Keyes.
That was short anyway.

1738
01:44:12,066 --> 01:44:14,192
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

1739
01:44:16,403 --> 01:44:19,030
What for?
So they can patch me up?

1740
01:44:20,107 --> 01:44:22,768
So they can nurse me along
till I get back on my feet?

1741
01:44:22,842 --> 01:44:26,242
So I can walk into that gas chamber
up at San Quentin on my own power?

1742
01:44:26,311 --> 01:44:27,902
Is that it, Keyes?

1743
01:44:27,979 --> 01:44:29,639
Something like that.

1744
01:44:30,614 --> 01:44:32,911
I've got a different idea.
Yeah?

1745
01:44:32,983 --> 01:44:34,347
Look, Keyes.

1746
01:44:34,717 --> 01:44:37,116
Suppose you went back to bed and
didn't find these cylinders...

1747
01:44:37,186 --> 01:44:39,551
till tomorrow morning,
when the office opens...

1748
01:44:39,621 --> 01:44:42,214
After that you can
play it any way you like.

1749
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:44,884
Would you do
that much for me, Keyes?

1750
01:44:45,159 --> 01:44:49,094
Give me one good reason. I need
four hours to get where I'm going.

1751
01:44:49,162 --> 01:44:52,358
You're not going anywhere,
Walter. You bet I am.

1752
01:44:53,265 --> 01:44:56,165
I'm going across the border.
You haven't got a chance, Walter.

1753
01:44:56,235 --> 01:44:57,792
Good enough to try for.

1754
01:44:57,869 --> 01:45:01,304
You'll never make the border.
That's what you think.

1755
01:45:02,005 --> 01:45:03,494
Just watch me.

1756
01:45:03,941 --> 01:45:06,101
You'll never even make
the elevator.

1757
01:45:06,342 --> 01:45:07,330
So long, Keyes.

1758
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,154
[Phone dialing]

1759
01:45:36,967 --> 01:45:38,263
(Keyes)
Hello...

1760
01:45:38,334 --> 01:45:40,961
send an ambulance to the
Pacific Building on Olive Street.

1761
01:45:43,171 --> 01:45:45,138
Yeah. It's a police job.

1762
01:46:04,955 --> 01:46:07,514
How you doing, Walter?
Fine.

1763
01:46:09,758 --> 01:46:13,284
Only somebody moved the
elevator a couple of miles away.

1764
01:46:13,862 --> 01:46:15,590
They're on the way.

1765
01:46:19,933 --> 01:46:22,560
You know why you couldn't
figure this one, Keyes?

1766
01:46:22,635 --> 01:46:24,124
I'll tell you.

1767
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:27,934
Because the guy you were
looking for was too close.

1768
01:46:28,006 --> 01:46:30,633
He was right across
the desk from you.

1769
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:32,832
Closer than that, Walter.

1770
01:46:33,744 --> 01:46:35,108
[Panting]

1771
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:38,503
I love you, too.
