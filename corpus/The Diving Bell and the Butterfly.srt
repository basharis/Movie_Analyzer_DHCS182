1
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,656
THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY

2
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:17,778
Look! He's waking.
–Page Dr Cocheton. Quickly.

3
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:20,027
Dr Cocheton to room 119, please.

4
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:23,537
Mr Bauby, open your eyes.
Open your eyes.

5
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:27,346
Mr Bauby, open your eyes.

6
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:32,547
You've been asleep for a long time,
you're waking up now. Can you hear me?

7
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,435
<i>Yes, I'm hearing you.</i>

8
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:39,371
<i>What's happening?</i>

9
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,419
<i>Jesus, a hospital.</i>

10
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:48,021
Mr Bauby, open your eyes wide.

11
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:52,498
Try to keep them open.

12
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:57,219
Yes, like that.
Follow this lamp with your eyes.

13
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:04,581
Alright.

14
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:09,942
Don't be alarmed.
You're in a hospital.

15
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:15,819
I'm a doctor. My name's Cocheton.
These are nurses.

16
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,897
We're here to take care of you.

17
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,137
Do you remember what happened?

18
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,657
Do you remember what happened?

19
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:30,576
<i>Just vague images</i>

20
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:41,379
You're in the Naval Hospital, Berck-sur-Mer.
On the coast. At Calais.

21
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:45,626
You were treated first in Paris,
and then brought here.

22
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:47,658
Do you remember that?

23
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:50,496
Jean-Dominique.

24
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:53,625
You've had a stroke.

25
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:56,819
You've been in a coma for
almost three weeks.

26
00:03:57,027 --> 00:04:00,656
But now you're waking up and you'll be fine.

27
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,341
I promise you.

28
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:05,564
<i>Thank you</i>

29
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:08,112
–I have to give you some simple tests.

30
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:10,779
Keep your eyes on me.

31
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:13,306
Good.

32
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:18,464
Follow my finger.
Good.

33
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:28,256
When I say blink,
please blink.

34
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:34,456
Excellent.

35
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,376
Now, tell me your name.

36
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:43,236
<i>Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>

37
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:44,656
–Come on, try

38
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,855
<i>I just did.</i>

39
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:48,462
–Try really hard, say your name.

40
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,907
<i>Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>

41
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:53,701
Try saying your children's names.

42
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:58,618
<i>Théophile, Céleste, Hortense.</i>

43
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,822
Don't worry.

44
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:08,498
It's a slow process.
But your speech will come back.

45
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:13,303
<i>What? Can't you hear me, doctor?
Doctor?</i>

46
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:16,658
<i>What's happening? I can't speak.</i>

47
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,984
<i>They can't hear me.
Oh my God.</i>

48
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:22,979
<i>I can't speak.</i>

49
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:25,382
<i>What's happened to me?</i>

50
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:30,020
<i>My name is Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>

51
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:31,182
<i>Doctor?</i>

52
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,915
<i>All right, all right.</i>

53
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:39,467
<i>I've had a stroke my speech'll
come back my memory will come back</i>

54
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:43,863
Everything will be alright, Mr Bauby.
We are here to care for you.

55
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,619
<i>I'll be patient.</i>

56
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:48,666
<i>Ok.</i>

57
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:51,304
<i>Ok, I believe you.</i>

58
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:05,586
<i>Who brought these flowers?</i>

59
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,625
<i>Roses.</i>

60
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,306
<i>Inčs.</i>

61
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:40,697
Did you sleep well?

62
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,665
Let's see.

63
00:06:56,147 --> 00:07:00,667
You're going to have an important visitor.
Dr Lepage, your neurologist.

64
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:02,885
So we want you at your very best.

65
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:30,979
Good morning.

66
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:35,427
I'm Alain Lepage, your neurologist.
You know Dr Cocheton, of course.

67
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:38,547
Jean-Dominique…
no, no, your friends call you Jean-Do.

68
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:42,027
So that's what I'm going to call you.
Think of me as your friend.

69
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,500
<i>Sure Doctor.</i>

70
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:48,223
As a friend I know how
difficult this is for you.

71
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:55,385
Nobody here has explained to
you the full extent of your condition.

72
00:07:56,827 --> 00:08:01,696
You've had what we call a
cerebrovascular accident.

73
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,540
It's put your brain stem out of action.

74
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:11,504
The brain stem is an essential
component of our internal computer

75
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:14,809
the link between the brain
and the spinal cord.

76
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:17,689
In the past, we would have
said you'd had a massive stroke.

77
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,973
You would very
probably have died.

78
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:26,580
But now we have such improved
resuscitation techniques

79
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:28,903
that we're able to prolong life.

80
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,665
<i>Is this life?</i>

81
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:34,427
<i>Is this life?
–Yes, prolong life.</i>

82
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:42,137
I'm not going to mince words,
Jean-Do. You are completely paralyzed.

83
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:48,616
You have realised you are unable to speak.

84
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:53,577
You have what we call…

85
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,777
“locked-in syndrome”.

86
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,568
<i>locked-in syndrome.</i>

87
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,218
–Locked-in syndrome.

88
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:11,505
It will be of no comfort to you but your
condition is extremely rare.

89
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:14,426
And we simply don't know the cause.

90
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:17,147
You don't smoke and you're
not a heavy drinker.

91
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:19,826
It just happened all of a sudden.

92
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:25,499
However, apart from being totally
paralysed…

93
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:28,505
you are normal in every other respect.

94
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:29,253
<i>Normal?</i>

95
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:30,345
–There is hope.

96
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,217
Your brain is functioning.

97
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:39,187
You're able to understand us.
You follow our movements with your eyes.

98
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:42,659
Although I'm not entirely
happy with your right eye.

99
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,659
This muscle doesn't work, see?

100
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:51,546
The eye doesn't get moisturized.

101
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,504
I'm afraid we have to cover that.

102
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:57,600
Don't we?

103
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:58,459
<i>Cover?</i>

104
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:00,814
<i>What does he want to cover?</i>

105
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:03,296
but I'll take a second guess on that.

106
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:09,781
We want you to take it easy for a few days.

107
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:11,695
<i>What d'you think I'm doing now?</i>

108
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:14,547
and then two beautiful
young women will visit you.

109
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:18,514
And when I say beautiful,
I mean beautiful.

110
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:19,373
<i>–Fine.</i>

111
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:24,415
They are great. Outstanding therapists and
miracle workers.

112
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:26,193
<i>No miracles please.</i>

113
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,859
–And so, as I say, there's hope…

114
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:31,547
<i>That's what you all showed me.</i>

115
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:34,347
You'll be well looked after, Jean-Do.
Really.

116
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:35,585
<i>That's a good start.</i>

117
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,539
–You'll be well looked after.

118
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:30,660
Good morning.

119
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:39,456
<i>Have I gone to heaven?</i>

120
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:40,581
–I'm Henriëtte.

121
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:45,019
And I'm Marie.
–You can blink your eyes, don't you?

122
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:48,617
So, I want you to blink once for yes,
twice for no.

123
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:52,657
<i>Fine! Two beauties and I'm helpless.</i>

124
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:54,298
–Can you read that?

125
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,622
<i>Where?</i>

126
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:59,866
H. Durand, logopediste.
–Can you see Durand?

127
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,187
<i>Good, Mr Bauby.
–Mrs or Miss?</i>

128
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:05,947
I'm your physical therapist.
First you have to learn again to swallow.

129
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:09,343
So I'll be working on your tongue and lips.

130
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:10,205
<i>Sounds fun.</i>

131
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:12,107
–And I'm your speech therapist.

132
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:17,187
Until you can actually speak again
I have to find a way for you to communicate.

133
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:19,358
Your condition is extremely rare.

134
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:20,227
<i>I know.</i>

135
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:24,507
we're going to have to work very hard.
–So we'd better get started.

136
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:29,063
Exactly. I just came in to introduce myself.
See you.

137
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:31,899
<i>See you.</i>

138
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,064
I want you to know…

139
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:47,867
that this is perhaps the most important
job I've ever been given.

140
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:52,139
And I'm determined to succeed.
With your help, of course.

141
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:59,336
I think you understand,
but I will ask you some questions.

142
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:01,780
Ok?

143
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,940
Remember, you answer
by blinking once for yes

144
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,179
or twice for no…

145
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:10,775
Am I a man?

146
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,386
Am I a woman?

147
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:18,287
Is the sun too bright for you?

148
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,261
Is it midnight now?

149
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:25,054
<i>What kinds of questions are this?</i>

150
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:26,263
–Are we in Paris?

151
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,101
Are we in Berck?

152
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:32,741
Does wood float?

153
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:34,503
<i>I don't think so.</i>

154
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,736
Do you remember having your stroke?

155
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,906
Were you the editor of Elle magazine?

156
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:45,664
<i>Yes, I was the editor-in-chief
of Elle.</i>

157
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:47,986
To Alaďa.

158
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,827
Your right eye isn't working properly.

159
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,744
Can you hear me?

160
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:32,105
Your right eye isn't working properly.,
I'm going to sew it up.

161
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:33,959
<i>Sew it up?</i>

162
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,416
–That happens…

163
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:39,301
an ulcerated cornea.

164
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:45,900
I've been skiing in St Moritz.
It's wonderful there now.

165
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:47,889
<i>I don't give a shit.</i>

166
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:51,986
nothing like sailing down a slope
with the wind in your face…

167
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:53,771
<i>Keep away from me</i>

168
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:54,921
Don't worry

169
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:56,506
<i>keep away from me</i>

170
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,609
You won't feel a thing.

171
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,534
<i>Please.</i>

172
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,060
<i>No, please don't…</i>

173
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,899
–You won't feel
anything. Just be quiet.

174
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:09,261
<i>Don't</i>

175
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:12,821
I've done this dozens of times.

176
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,535
It will be fine.

177
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,425
Don't worry.

178
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:30,381
Almost done.
A few more pinpricks.

179
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:34,375
Perfect, even if I say so myself.

180
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,341
Done.

181
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,729
We're going to dress you to
cheer you up a bit.

182
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,022
Afterwards we have a surprise.

183
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:19,559
We're going to try
you in this wheelchair.

184
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:26,105
Ok.

185
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:31,424
Wheel him up and down, will you?

186
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:36,699
These are my students.
Pay no attention to them.

187
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:39,229
I want to be sure that
sitting like that won't

188
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,843
trigger uncontrollable muscular spasms.

189
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:44,107
He needs a cushion behind his head

190
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:49,016
Sorry we have to do this to you, Jean-Do.
Excellent. Excellent.

191
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:51,946
You can handle the wheelchair.

192
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:54,587
<i>You can handle the wheelchair.
What an honor.</i>

193
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:55,881
–That is good news.

194
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,704
And now for the surprise

195
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:14,385
<i>Oh my God, who's that? Me?</i>

196
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:20,460
<i>I look as if I've emerged from a vat
of formaldehyde.</i>

197
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:23,375
<i>Horrible.</i>

198
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:28,384
<i>Is that my surprise?
To see myself?</i>

199
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:43,096
<i>Céline.</i>

200
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:54,377
How are you?
Ok, let me explain that.

201
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,667
Isn't this a wonderful surprise, Jean-Do?
Your first visitor is your wife.

202
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:02,594
<i>No, she's the mother of my children.</i>

203
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:05,703
–He understands everything.
Everything.

204
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:10,621
If you ask a question,
make it a yes-or-no question. Ok?

205
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:14,820
He'll blink. One for yes, two for no.

206
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:16,340
Ok.

207
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:22,497
One more thing. Stay in front of him
when you talk to him. Ok?

208
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:26,620
If you stand here, he can't see you,
and here neither.

209
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:29,899
Talk to him like this.
Right, Jean-Do?

210
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:34,146
I'll leave you. I'm sure you have a lot
to say to each other…

211
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:56,175
They tell me you're doing…

212
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:02,736
Everyone sends their love.
And their prayers.

213
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,383
I didn't bring the children.

214
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,445
I thought I should see you first.

215
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:13,145
They're both well.
They miss you.

216
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:16,821
Celeste prays for you every night.

217
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,901
Do you want me to bring them?

218
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:26,409
Don't you want to see them?

219
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,409
Laurent wants to visit.
Do you want to see him?

220
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:40,706
Him you want to see.

221
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:44,019
I'll tell him.

222
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,903
Has she been to see you?

223
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,576
I've met the speech therapist.
I like her.

224
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,577
She thinks she can help you.

225
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:34,618
Please don't cry.

226
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:45,740
<i>I know Berck station.
I can see her now.</i>

227
00:20:45,947 --> 00:20:48,547
<i>It's the most depressing
place in the world.</i>

228
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:53,141
<i>Well, it certainly was when I had my
holidays here as a child.</i>

229
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:55,860
<i>Berck. The end of summer.</i>

230
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:59,147
<i>Waiting with my father
for the Paris train.</i>

231
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:03,419
<i>It was desolate then and it'll be
more desolate now.</i>

232
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:09,379
<i>I treated her so badly.
And the children, too.</i>

233
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:15,386
<i>And now I will never be able
to make amends.</i>

234
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,700
<i>Never.</i>

235
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:20,266
Look at this.

236
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:26,307
As you can see, it's not the alphabet
we learned at school.

237
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:29,592
These letters are presented
in order of usage frequency.

238
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:30,820
Do you understand?

239
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:36,343
E, S, A, R, I, N…

240
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,342
<i>Usage frequency?</i>

241
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:48,544
I've talked to a host of colleagues…

242
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:51,107
and I think I've come up
with a viable system.

243
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:51,871
<i>Good for you.</i>

244
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,267
–This is how it works.

245
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:57,903
You think of something to say.
When you're ready, blink.

246
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:03,184
I'll recite this alphabet,
very slowly, letter by letter.

247
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:06,587
When I get to the first letter
of your word, blink.

248
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:11,417
I'll write it down, letter for letter,
and so on.

249
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,585
In that way we'll form words and sentences.

250
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:18,826
Two other things: blink twice
when the word is formed.

251
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:21,701
As if you're hitting the
space bar on a keyboard.

252
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,315
And blink rapidly if we make a mistake.

253
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:26,892
I know it sounds terribly arduous but,

254
00:22:26,932 --> 00:22:29,187
believe me, we'll become
expert very quickly.

255
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:32,856
And your friends and family can use it, too.

256
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:36,343
Are you ready for this?
Look at me.

257
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:38,841
Do you want to try?

258
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:41,944
Have you thought of
something you want to say?

259
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:43,739
Good.

260
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,148
So, let's begin.

261
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:46,205
<i>Wait, no…</i>

262
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:49,410
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

263
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:49,856
–E.

264
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:53,805
Is E the first letter?

265
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,616
<i>No.</i>

266
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:56,903
E is not the first letter.

267
00:22:56,904 --> 00:22:59,016
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

268
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:02,657
It's difficult, I know, so let's go slowly.

269
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:07,578
E, S, A…

270
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,745
<i>That's too slow.</i>

271
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:22,816
<i>I can't keep my eyelids open that long.
Get cracking!</i>

272
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,022
I…

273
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:29,509
I?

274
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,738
<i>Good.</i>

275
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,464
Is I the first word?

276
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:38,137
<i>My first word is I.
I begin with myself.</i>

277
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:39,541
E, S…

278
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:41,655
S?

279
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:42,786
<i>No.</i>

280
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:43,858
–No?

281
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:44,650
Not S.

282
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:46,786
<i>That was too fast.</i>

283
00:23:50,747 --> 00:23:54,587
<i>It doesn't work. This is a nightmare.
It'll never work.</i>

284
00:23:54,627 --> 00:23:56,185
Shall we go on?

285
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:58,858
<i>I've had enough.</i>

286
00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:06,018
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

287
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,857
<i>Up, down, up.</i>

288
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:36,865
<i>Under my arms.</i>

289
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:40,377
<i>The back of my legs.</i>

290
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:43,503
<i>I'm forty-two years old…</i>

291
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:47,477
<i>and I'm being handled
like a big baby.</i>

292
00:24:49,427 --> 00:24:53,261
<i>my private parts wiped and swaddled.</i>

293
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,903
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

294
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:00,896
<i>But as the poet says:</i>

295
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:05,001
<i>only a fool laughs when
there's nothing to laugh at.</i>

296
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:07,583
Blow me a kiss.

297
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:09,982
Come on.

298
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:13,060
Try it.

299
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:19,421
Come on.

300
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:22,616
Try.

301
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:25,017
It's difficult.

302
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:26,067
<i>No mirror.</i>

303
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,186
But that's what I want you to work at.

304
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,427
<i>Not that face.</i>

305
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:32,985
When you're resting or
watching TV, or any time at all,

306
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:35,665
I want you to work at blowing me a kiss.

307
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:36,459
Okay?

308
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,260
<i>Okay.</i>

309
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:41,187
And one other thing you have
to practise as much as possible.

310
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:45,300
And that's sliding your tongue
to the back of your palate.

311
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:50,499
That's how you'll learn to swallow again.
Watch.

312
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,020
<i>This just isn't fair. Not fair.</i>

313
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:07,930
You try it.

314
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:09,899
<i>Put that mirror away.</i>

315
00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:12,539
Open your mouth.

316
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:15,335
Good.

317
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:18,744
Try sliding your tongue backwards.

318
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:23,111
<i>I can't.</i>

319
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:24,535
–Try, go on.

320
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,743
<i>I can't.</i>

321
00:26:26,947 --> 00:26:29,222
Good! You moved your tongue.

322
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:31,539
<i>Don't make a fool of me.</i>

323
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,181
–Very good. Again.

324
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:38,115
Unbelievable. Good.

325
00:26:38,116 --> 00:26:40,019
<i>Yes, but true.</i>

326
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:48,664
I'll help you to move your head on your own.
Like that.

327
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:53,400
<i>You're doing it all.</i>

328
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:54,219
–Left.

329
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,546
Good.

330
00:26:57,187 --> 00:26:59,940
Right. Good.

331
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:03,819
Left again.

332
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:17,545
Can you feel my hands on your face?

333
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:19,305
<i>No.</i>

334
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:22,340
Never mind, you will, you will.

335
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:28,955
We're all very sorry for
what's happened to you.

336
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,816
I'm a regular reader of Elle.
I love it.

337
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:38,417
I just wish all the models
didn't look like boys.

338
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:44,425
<i>I don't think so.</i>

339
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:46,907
–They're getting thinner and thinner.

340
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,585
An odd fashion.

341
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,303
<i>How beautiful she is.</i>

342
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:59,260
I have a strong faith.
I pray for you every day.

343
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:06,507
He can only see with his right eye.
Look straight at him when you talk.

344
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:07,801
<i>Who is that?</i>

345
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:14,385
<i>Pierre Roussin.</i>

346
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:19,789
Do you remember me?

347
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,063
<i>Of course.</i>

348
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,911
He blinks once for yes….

349
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,947
<i>Damn, I didn't call him back.</i>

350
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:28,104
Do you want me to leave?
–No, please not.

351
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,980
<i>Why didn't I call him back?</i>

352
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:34,577
I heard what happened to you.
And I just wanted…

353
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:41,409
I was compelled to come and see you
because of what happened to me.

354
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:47,266
In a way, I know what you're going through

355
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:55,023
Being taken hostage is not so different
from what you're going through,

356
00:28:56,347 --> 00:28:57,290
Am I right?

357
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,281
<i>Hostage?</i>

358
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:04,377
Jean-Dominique was kind enough
to give me his seat on a flight

359
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:10,696
The plane was high-jacked and I remained
a hostage in Beirut for four years.

360
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:14,754
Four years, four months,
two weeks, five days

361
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:15,850
and seven hours.

362
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:21,462
They kept me in a cellar.
Very small. Dark.

363
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,544
It was hard to breathe.

364
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:27,097
I called it my tomb.

365
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:33,098
I know, a lot about wines.

366
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:35,944
<i>What happened to his hand?</i>

367
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:42,302
I used to recite aloud the wines of the
Bordeaux classification of 1855.

368
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:48,536
Château Margaux, Margaux.
Château Lafite Rotschild, Pauillac.

369
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:56,100
That's what preserved my sanity.

370
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:06,546
Most times, I was in despair.
Suicidal. Angry.

371
00:30:09,227 --> 00:30:13,140
The beatings, the filth, the cruelty.

372
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:16,464
But the worst was the waiting.

373
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:19,425
I survived.

374
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:26,143
I survived, because I held
fast to my own humanity.

375
00:30:30,647 --> 00:30:33,822
That's all I could do
because that's all I had,

376
00:30:33,922 --> 00:30:34,879
just like you.

377
00:30:38,907 --> 00:30:45,176
Cling to your own humanity
and you'll survive.

378
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:47,466
<i>Humanity? Easy.</i>

379
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:50,823
–I just had to say
that to you in person.

380
00:30:51,787 --> 00:30:56,383
<i>Why didn't I call him,
when he was back from Beirut?</i>

381
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:58,237
<i>I felt too guilty.</i>

382
00:30:58,427 --> 00:31:00,004
It's ridiculous…

383
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:02,181
<i>It's not. I feel ashamed.</i>

384
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,702
I?

385
00:31:17,187 --> 00:31:18,540
W?

386
00:31:19,787 --> 00:31:20,742
I want?

387
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:24,049
What do you want, Mr Bauby?

388
00:31:34,587 --> 00:31:35,861
D

389
00:31:45,107 --> 00:31:46,335
I.

390
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:57,296
E.

391
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:04,502
Die.

392
00:32:05,547 --> 00:32:07,185
You want to die?

393
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:11,265
How dare you!

394
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:18,456
There are people who love you
and care for you.

395
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,943
I hardly know you and
yet I'm there for you.

396
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:25,067
And you're alive.
So, don't say you want to die.

397
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:27,223
It's offensive and obscene.

398
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,459
You want to continue?

399
00:32:36,227 --> 00:32:37,865
Alright.

400
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:43,291
I'll come back another time and see
if you've changed your mind.

401
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,703
I'm sorry.

402
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:16,162
<i>Why?</i>

403
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:18,265
–I went too far.

404
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:23,939
Rest yourself.

405
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:41,901
Do you like it?
I didn't really know what to bring.

406
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:44,382
Look, I also brought this.

407
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:46,198
One moment.

408
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,915
<i>What are you doing?</i>

409
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,058
<i>What is that?</i>

410
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:55,029
<i>That's not true.
This makes me look like a rabbit.</i>

411
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:59,943
I just read the letters and you blink,
is that ok?

412
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:01,143
<i>Let it be.</i>

413
00:34:01,183 --> 00:34:01,739
–Ok?

414
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:07,518
S of A?

415
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,135
<i>As you want it.</i>

416
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,279
<i>A.</i>

417
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,260
<i>Good then A.</i>

418
00:34:20,147 --> 00:34:21,102
N?

419
00:34:22,347 --> 00:34:23,860
<i>Good, N.</i>

420
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,066
<i>Anne.</i>

421
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:33,027
<i>You have to look at me, Laurent.</i>

422
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:37,982
Shit, I forgot to look at you.
Sorry, I'll start again and slow down.

423
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:40,297
<i>As you like it…</i>

424
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:49,066
<i>Funny.</i>

425
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:52,225
I've never been a good hospital visitor.

426
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:54,830
I'm the sort who brings
food and then eats it.

427
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,867
<i>That's not true.</i>

428
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:57,747
Why did that have to happen to you?

429
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:01,307
Everybody's talking about it.
I was in Cafe de Flore last night…

430
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:06,825
I heard someone say, “Did you know that
Jean-Do Bauby is now a complete vegetable?”

431
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:07,637
<i>Vegetable.</i>

432
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:08,983
–He can't see you.

433
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:11,741
<i>Who said that?</i>

434
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:13,945
<i>And what sort of vegetable?</i>

435
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:16,822
A carrot, a potato, a pickled cucumber?

436
00:36:29,907 --> 00:36:35,451
<i>Today it seems to me that my whole life
was nothing but a string of failures.</i>

437
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:41,422
<i>the women I was unable to love,
the chances I failed to seize…</i>

438
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:45,506
<i>the moments of happiness
I allowed to drift away…</i>

439
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:48,507
<i>A race whose result you know
beforehand…</i>

440
00:36:48,547 --> 00:36:51,847
<i>but in which you fail to bet on
the winner.</i>

441
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,897
<i>Have I been blind or stupid?</i>

442
00:36:55,907 --> 00:37:01,781
<i>Or does it take the harsh light of disaster
to to show a person their true nature?</i>

443
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:10,859
I'm still here.

444
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:17,493
Would you like me to work with you today?

445
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:24,302
Good.

446
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,306
We're going to master this.

447
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:29,516
Do you agree?

448
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:30,827
<i>Yes, mistress.</i>

449
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:32,266
Ok.

450
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:34,700
I'll begin.

451
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:48,702
T?

452
00:37:51,427 --> 00:37:52,382
H?

453
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:57,895
A?

454
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:07,541
K? Thank you.

455
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:10,105
Thank you?

456
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:12,539
Thank you.

457
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:14,764
May I call you Jean-Do?

458
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:16,507
<i>Women are not complicated.</i>

459
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,139
Thank you, Jean-Do.

460
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:31,066
I?

461
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,658
I have?

462
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:42,065
<i>I have decided not feel sorry
for myself again.</i>

463
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:50,873
<i>Apart from my eyes, there two more
things that aren't paralysed.</i>

464
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,345
<i>My imagination…</i>

465
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:56,426
<i>and my memory.</i>

466
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:15,253
<i>My imagination and my memory are the
only way I can escape my diving bell.</i>

467
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:43,699
<i>I can imagine anything,
anyone, anywhere</i>

468
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:54,067
<i>I let the sea wash over me
on the isle of Martinique.</i>

469
00:39:54,107 --> 00:39:56,462
<i>Visit the women I love.</i>

470
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:10,897
<i>Bow before Ozym Andias,
king of kings.</i>

471
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,415
<i>I can imagine anything.</i>

472
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:24,945
<i>As a child I dreamed
of my abilities as an adult.</i>

473
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:27,947
<i>Now I want to remember myself
as I was.</i>

474
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:32,503
<i>Handsome, debonair, glamorous.
And devilishly attractive</i>

475
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:35,706
<i>Yes, glamorous and
handsome, some people said.</i>

476
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:38,584
<i>That's not me, that's Marlon Brando.</i>

477
00:40:38,747 --> 00:40:40,260
<i>That's me.</i>

478
00:41:12,307 --> 00:41:16,220
Is this Betty Mialet?
–Yes, this is she.

479
00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:21,509
My name is Henriëtte Durand. I'm a therapist
at Berck-sur-Mer Naval Hospital.

480
00:41:21,587 --> 00:41:25,627
I'm calling on behalf of one of my patients,
Jean-Dominique Bauby.

481
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:28,386
Jean-Do? How is he?

482
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:32,539
Comfortable but…
–I heard he's completely paralyzed.

483
00:41:32,587 --> 00:41:37,339
That he can't communicate with anybody.
–That's not absolutely accurate.

484
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,822
Come in.

485
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:44,305
He wants me to ask you for a favour.

486
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,662
Of course. Can you wait a minute?

487
00:41:47,587 --> 00:41:48,906
Anything.

488
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,224
He says he has a contract
with you for a book.

489
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,307
He said that? He can speak, I thought he
couldn't speak.

490
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:59,579
He can. In a way. I'll explain later.

491
00:41:59,787 --> 00:42:04,144
About this book…
–Yes, he's got a contract with us,

492
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:08,175
but now, given the circumstances…
–He wants to fulfill it.

493
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:12,977
He wants to write the book.
–You can't be serious?

494
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:16,981
Let me assure you, he can.

495
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:23,899
But do you think you can
find someone to take his dictation?

496
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:25,665
Someone who's patient.

497
00:42:26,787 --> 00:42:32,339
Somebody with a lot of time.
Someone special.

498
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:35,505
Yes, I understand. I'll get back to you.

499
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:40,267
Betty Mialet said Claude Mendibil
was sent from heaven.

500
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,867
She said no one could be
more perfect for this.

501
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:46,667
Betty always exaggerates.
I will have to practise with Henriëtte.

502
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,823
Any time.

503
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:51,503
He wants to say something.

504
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,060
No?

505
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:17,178
No panic.

506
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:26,267
Claude has taken a room in a hotel.
Perhaps you ought to discuss a routine.

507
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:32,257
<i>The nurses wake me at five a.m.
I'll think of what I want to write.</i>

508
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:36,779
<i>You can come at eight
then I'll dictate it to you.</i>

509
00:43:37,507 --> 00:43:40,626
Good. I'll do my best for you.

510
00:43:40,627 --> 00:43:42,706
<i>I know you will.</i>

511
00:43:42,907 --> 00:43:45,036
<i>Can we begin tomorrow?</i>

512
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:46,183
–Of course.

513
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:16,551
Through?

514
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:19,746
<i>Through the frayed
curtain of my window…</i>

515
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,217
<i>a wan glow announces
the break of day.</i>

516
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,863
<i>My heels hurt, my head weighs a ton</i>

517
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:31,185
<i>my whole body is encased
in a kind of diving suit.</i>

518
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:35,067
<i>My task now is to write
the motionless travel notes…</i>

519
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:38,473
<i>from a castaway
on the shores of loneliness.</i>

520
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:44,891
<i>This Naval Hospital has in its time been
a home to children with tuberculosis</i>

521
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:49,315
<i>In the hall, there's
a white marble bust…</i>

522
00:44:49,507 --> 00:44:52,943
<i>of Empress Eugénie,
the wife of Napoleon Ill…</i>

523
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:57,100
<i>the hospital's patroness.
She came here regularly.</i>

524
00:44:57,307 --> 00:45:01,983
<i>There was a fat farm,
a school and a place where</i>

525
00:45:02,187 --> 00:45:05,227
<i>the great Diaghilev
rehearsed his Ballet Russe…</i>

526
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:11,058
<i>They say it was here that Nijinsky leapt
twelve feet into the air.</i>

527
00:45:13,867 --> 00:45:16,507
<i>No one here now leaps into the air.</i>

528
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:23,066
<i>These days they are all elderly,
enfeebled or, like me, rigid and mute.</i>

529
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:25,297
<i>A battalion of cripples.</i>

530
00:45:28,507 --> 00:45:32,227
<i>But I like being wheeled to the
place I call Cinecitta.</i>

531
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:34,041
<i>A perpetually deserted
terrace, a vast series</i>

532
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:35,747
of balconies that open
onto a landscape…

533
00:45:35,787 --> 00:45:39,879
<i>heavy with the poetic and offbeat
charm of a movie set.</i>

534
00:45:40,707 --> 00:45:43,922
<i>A handful of buildings at
the foot of the sand dunes</i>

535
00:45:43,962 --> 00:45:46,787
<i>give the illusion of a
ghost town in a Western.</i>

536
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,863
<i>And I enjoy seeing
the suburbs of Berck</i>

537
00:45:49,907 --> 00:45:52,811
<i>that look like a model train lay-out…</i>

538
00:45:54,027 --> 00:45:56,567
<i>The sea foams such an
incandescent white that it might</i>

539
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,907
<i>be the product of the
special-effects department.</i>

540
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:02,187
<i>But my favorite sight of all
is the lighthouse.</i>

541
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:06,539
<i>tall, robust, reassuring
in red and white stripes…</i>

542
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:10,747
<i>I place myself under the
protection of this brotherly symbol…</i>

543
00:46:10,787 --> 00:46:14,302
<i>guardian not just of sailors
but of the sick…</i>

544
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:17,427
<i>whom fate has cast
to the far edge of life.</i>

545
00:46:17,467 --> 00:46:23,064
The two highlights of this mini museum
are a white marble bust…

546
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:29,217
which embodies the radiant youth

547
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:31,593
of a princess who died with 94…

548
00:46:31,627 --> 00:46:36,542
<i>Five hours of work.
Doesn't sound bad.</i>

549
00:46:39,347 --> 00:46:41,258
<i>It's not Balzac.</i>

550
00:46:43,027 --> 00:46:44,380
Shall I continue?

551
00:46:45,987 --> 00:46:50,378
–Read Balzac to me.

552
00:46:50,547 --> 00:46:53,744
<i>Or Graham Greene.</i>

553
00:46:53,907 --> 00:46:57,405
[Laurent reading Graham Greene's
The Honorary Consul]

554
00:47:08,987 --> 00:47:12,821
I'm 45 divorced,
and I want to speak the consul.

555
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:49,544
What's that?
–Is it a man or a woman?

556
00:47:52,867 --> 00:47:56,462
A man. I think.
–He winked at you.

557
00:47:58,907 --> 00:48:03,423
Excuse me,
but did you order a speaker phone?

558
00:48:09,107 --> 00:48:11,302
Did you order a phone?

559
00:48:13,987 --> 00:48:15,439
Let's get out of here.

560
00:48:17,627 --> 00:48:20,744
Who let you in? What are you doing?

561
00:48:20,947 --> 00:48:23,415
We're from Telecom France.

562
00:48:23,627 --> 00:48:27,917
You should have gone to Reception first.
–There was no one there.

563
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:31,155
Just install it by the table,
please, thank you.

564
00:48:37,747 --> 00:48:39,863
Be careful, please.

565
00:48:41,747 --> 00:48:44,041
We'll let people know
you've got a phone now.

566
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:46,427
They'll have to book
a time for their calls.

567
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:48,822
We'll make sure someone's with you.

568
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:56,195
Excuse me, madame, can't he speak?

569
00:48:56,235 --> 00:48:58,947
–Don't talk about him
as if he weren't here.

570
00:48:58,987 --> 00:49:01,057
Ask him.

571
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:05,307
Madame, excuse me, but, if he can't
speak what's he want a phone for?

572
00:49:05,347 --> 00:49:07,542
Perhaps he's a heavy breather.

573
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:13,017
You think you're funny?

574
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:16,301
How dare you!

575
00:49:18,147 --> 00:49:21,503
<i>You miss a sense of humor, Henriëtte.</i>

576
00:49:23,987 --> 00:49:27,138
And three. Calm, four.

577
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,503
<i>A very black fly settles on my nose.</i>

578
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:51,818
<i>I waggle my head to
unseat him. He digs in…</i>

579
00:49:52,027 --> 00:49:54,187
<i>Olympic wrestling is child's play
compared to this.</i>

580
00:49:54,227 --> 00:49:57,776
You moved your head.
When did you start doing that?

581
00:49:57,987 --> 00:49:59,500
<i>Thank you.</i>

582
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:10,460
Just now?

583
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:13,420
A miracle! You can turn your head!

584
00:50:13,627 --> 00:50:16,006
<i>Marie sees miracles everywhere.</i>

585
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:18,462
–Dr Lepage, he moved his head.

586
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:19,350
Good morning.

587
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,627
<i>A miracle! He only
said good morning once!</i>

588
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,162
Progress, progress.

589
00:50:23,163 --> 00:50:24,549
<i>That's better.</i>

590
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:30,427
How's the tongue?
–I'll open your mouth.

591
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:35,103
The tongue moves

592
00:50:35,267 --> 00:50:37,172
Then we can go further with his speech.

593
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:40,147
–The movement of the tongue
is crucial so there's hope.

594
00:50:40,187 --> 00:50:42,496
Great, that's awesome.

595
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:47,261
We're going to work really hard,
soon you'll be able to eat normally.

596
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:51,137
<i>A text is only real when it's read.</i>

597
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:56,495
<i>I shaved my father when I visited him
the last time before my accident.</i>

598
00:50:56,587 --> 00:51:01,263
<i>He was unwell and I stayed overnight
in his apartment in Paris.</i>

599
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:05,540
<i>The next morning
I shaved his stubble.</i>

600
00:51:05,747 --> 00:51:09,422
Who can see if I'm shaven?
–Me.

601
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:14,021
I'm terrified.
–Of what?

602
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:17,496
You shaving me.

603
00:51:19,027 --> 00:51:22,787
You were always so damned clumsy.
–That runs in the family.

604
00:51:22,827 --> 00:51:24,180
Sure.

605
00:51:24,507 --> 00:51:26,543
Coffee?
–No.

606
00:51:29,307 --> 00:51:33,903
Don't tire him. He's not well.
–How can a shave tire him?

607
00:51:41,107 --> 00:51:44,587
Your mother was prettier.
–That wouldn't be difficult.

608
00:51:44,627 --> 00:51:47,778
Do you remember your mother?
–Oh yeah.

609
00:51:49,027 --> 00:51:53,449
You always ask me that and I always say
the same thing: not really.

610
00:51:57,427 --> 00:51:59,897
What are you reading at the moment?

611
00:51:59,898 --> 00:52:02,626
–Re-reading.
The Count of Monte Cristo.

612
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:03,091
Why?

613
00:52:03,191 --> 00:52:07,815
–Because I'm thinking of
writing a modern version.

614
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:10,337
Of the Count of Monte Cristo?
–Yes.

615
00:52:11,227 --> 00:52:15,425
Vengeance will still be the driving force…

616
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:20,247
but I'm setting it in today's world.
And Monte Cristo will be a woman.

617
00:52:22,787 --> 00:52:25,824
The Countess of Monte Cristo…?
–Yes, a woman.

618
00:52:26,027 --> 00:52:31,385
I don't want to read it.
–I haven't written it yet.

619
00:52:32,427 --> 00:52:36,306
But I've got a contract
with a book publisher.

620
00:52:39,987 --> 00:52:43,297
If you cut me, I'll sue.

621
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:52,496
The doctor came yesterday.
–And?

622
00:52:53,347 --> 00:52:59,138
He says I'll live to be a hundred.
–Good. I'll give you a great party.

623
00:52:59,347 --> 00:53:03,659
I won't attend.
Who wants to live to be a hundred?

624
00:53:04,987 --> 00:53:08,377
Jean-Do, don't tell a soul.

625
00:53:09,427 --> 00:53:11,657
I still miss your mother.

626
00:53:13,507 --> 00:53:18,103
I won't. It's our secret.

627
00:53:19,427 --> 00:53:24,057
You should have married Céline.
–What difference would that have made?

628
00:53:25,227 --> 00:53:30,665
You wouldn't have left her so easily.
And your children.

629
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:35,258
Do we have to talk about this?
–I know what I'm talking about.

630
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:42,066
No one had more affairs than I did.
Well, maybe Casanova, but no one else.

631
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:45,395
Having an affair with
another woman is no reason

632
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,071
for leaving the mother of your children.

633
00:53:48,227 --> 00:53:53,620
There are no standards anymore.
It's not funny, it's true.

634
00:53:56,747 --> 00:54:00,587
And bring your children to see me.
Sylvie brings them, too.

635
00:54:00,627 --> 00:54:05,257
You should bring them as well.
–Ok, I haven't found time yet.

636
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:07,935
Here.
–What is that?

637
00:54:08,107 --> 00:54:12,737
Orange blossom.
–Do I have to smell like a tart?

638
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:16,902
It's an aphrodisiac.

639
00:54:17,867 --> 00:54:21,072
Good. That'll make
the girls come running.

640
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:25,057
–Sure, but give them a
chance to smell you.

641
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:27,946
Let me look at myself.

642
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:46,304
Not bad. My God, they don't make
them like me anymore.

643
00:55:02,147 --> 00:55:04,422
I wanted to tell you something.

644
00:55:06,307 --> 00:55:09,663
Can't remember.
–It'll come back.

645
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:11,186
I'm not so sure.

646
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:15,505
I remember less and less.
–Don't exaggerate.

647
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:18,977
Oh yes, I remember.

648
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:26,179
I'm very proud of you.
I really am.

649
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,099
And something else…

650
00:55:38,307 --> 00:55:40,423
Can't remember.

651
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:44,666
<i>A father's approval.
I found it comforting then…</i>

652
00:55:44,867 --> 00:55:49,289
<i>and I find it even more comforting now.
We are all children.</i>

653
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,345
<i>We all need approval.</i>

654
00:55:53,307 --> 00:55:55,485
<i>I want to see my children.</i>

655
00:55:56,427 --> 00:55:58,605
<i>I want to see my children.</i>

656
00:56:01,467 --> 00:56:05,585
Here we are. Father's Day.

657
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:08,056
Happy Father's Day!

658
00:56:19,067 --> 00:56:25,073
<i>I guess that even a rough sketch, a shadow,
a tiny fragment of a dad is still a dad.</i>

659
00:56:47,347 --> 00:56:52,341
<i>Father's Day. My son wiping the saliva
that escapes my closed lips.</i>

660
00:56:52,507 --> 00:56:58,051
<i>We have never before fitted this made-up
holiday into our emotional calendar.</i>

661
00:57:01,307 --> 00:57:04,822
[singing]

662
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:14,860
Claude says the book's going well.
I can't believe you're writing it.

663
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:19,267
I still think you're the most
surprising man I've ever known.

664
00:57:19,307 --> 00:57:21,298
Have you had lots of visitors?

665
00:57:25,427 --> 00:57:27,418
Laurent, Anne-Marie…

666
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:30,941
Michel…

667
00:57:32,147 --> 00:57:35,139
That's it? She hasn't?

668
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:40,388
I thought she was supposed
to be madly in love with you.

669
00:57:40,428 --> 00:57:42,144
Well, that's her business.

670
00:57:48,027 --> 00:57:50,495
Shall we practice that alphabet?

671
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:38,379
When I began a diet a week before my stroke

672
00:58:38,587 --> 00:58:44,059
I never dreamed of such dramatic results.

673
00:58:46,987 --> 00:58:54,496
Now they know what it's like to have a
zombie for a father. Thank you.

674
00:58:54,707 --> 00:58:55,961
That's not amusing.

675
00:58:56,067 --> 00:58:57,625
Kids.

676
00:58:59,627 --> 00:59:01,607
You want to play Hangman, dad?

677
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:05,702
I'll help you. Whisper a word.

678
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:11,505
The first letter is a C, the last an E.
The word has 7 letters.

–Say goodbye to your
dad, kids. We're leaving.

685
01:00:17,107 --> 01:00:18,381
Bye, dad.

686
01:00:20,347 --> 01:00:21,462
Bye, dad.

687
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:32,824
Bye dad. See you next week.

691

01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:31,035
<i>I feel sorry for myself,
don't you think?</i>

694
01:01:31,507 --> 01:01:33,179
You were genuinely happy.

695
01:01:34,587 --> 01:01:35,907
<i>You think so?</i>

696
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,426
<i>Perhaps.</i>

697
01:01:45,547 --> 01:01:49,620
<i>I don't want to miss this.
Step aside!</i>

698
01:01:54,827 --> 01:01:56,314
Enjoy. See you.

699
01:01:56,315 --> 01:01:59,537
<i>Yeah, see you. What are you doing?</i>

700
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:10,501
<i>I want TV-meals.
Or shall I go out for dinner?</i>

701
01:02:11,467 --> 01:02:16,746
<i>I will treat myself
to a feast at Le Duc.</i>

702
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:31,139
What a coincidence to find you here.
–Isn't that amazing?

703
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,144
An oyster?

704
01:03:12,947 --> 01:03:17,237
It seems like it was just yesterday
when I first heard your name.

705
01:04:36,107 --> 01:04:37,335
Sweet.

706
01:04:41,107 --> 01:04:42,665
No compliments.

707
01:04:46,227 --> 01:04:47,899
And the next chapter?

708
01:04:48,107 --> 01:04:51,497
<i>Sunday. I dread Sunday.</i>

709
01:04:52,507 --> 01:04:54,211
<i>When they turn the TV on,</i>

710
01:04:54,251 --> 01:04:57,287
they have to make sure
they're doing it right.

711
01:04:57,307 --> 01:04:59,287
<i>That is very strategic.</i>

712
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:05,626
<i>It can take hours until
the next good Samaritan comes by.</i>

713
01:05:06,267 --> 01:05:10,067
<i>Horrible, these Sundays. No speech
therapists, no psychotherapist.</i>

714
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:14,419
<i>No physiotherapist, no visitors.
A skeleton staff.</i>

715
01:05:14,627 --> 01:05:17,067
<i>Sunday is a long stretch of desert.</i>

716
01:05:17,107 --> 01:05:21,942
<i>But today, Marie nobly suggests
she takes me to mass.</i>

717
01:05:22,147 --> 01:05:27,187
<i>I have tried to explain to her that I am
not a religious man, but without avail.</i>

718
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:29,759
<i>All over the world
people are praying for me.</i>

719
01:05:29,799 --> 01:05:32,439
Top of the list is my daughter, Céleste.

720
01:05:33,147 --> 01:05:34,995
<i>And Marie, of course.</i>

721
01:05:36,467 --> 01:05:40,227
<i>The most diverse deities
have been enlisted to help me.</i>

722
01:05:40,267 --> 01:05:43,831
<i>In Nepal, I'm told,
they chant a mantra for me.</i>

723
01:05:43,987 --> 01:05:49,135
<i>In Cameroon holy man has procured
for me the goodwill of Africa's gods.</i>

724
01:05:49,347 --> 01:05:51,987
<i>I have assigned him my right eye.</i>

725
01:05:52,507 --> 01:05:57,267
<i>I can't deny that I have attempted to
organise this vast spiritual energy…</i>

726
01:05:57,307 --> 01:05:59,353
<i>to support my existence.</i>

727
01:05:59,387 --> 01:06:05,393
<i>It may not be admirable, it may even be
a touch hypocritical, but I'll try anything.</i>

728
01:06:13,227 --> 01:06:15,405
I'm very pleased to see you here.

729
01:06:16,107 --> 01:06:18,458
I came to visit you a
few days ago. I brought

730
01:06:18,498 --> 01:06:20,907
the Blessed Sacrament
to give you Communion.

731
01:06:20,947 --> 01:06:22,585
But you were asleep.

732
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,456
<i>Yes, he was asleep.
–What?</i>

733
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:29,438
<i>Would you like me to give
you Holy Communion now?</i>

734
01:06:29,478 --> 01:06:29,742
–No.

735
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:31,924
Yes.

736
01:06:31,964 --> 01:06:33,627
–Would you like me to
say a blessing over you?

737
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:35,623
<i>No.
–Yes.</i>

738
01:06:36,547 --> 01:06:38,821
Heavenly Father, have
mercy on Jean-Dominique,

739
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:40,511
who is cruelly afflicted.

740
01:06:41,507 --> 01:06:46,456
Help his body to heal,
keep his spirits buoyant,

741
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:49,467
<i>and help him to find faith.
–My spirit is very buoyant, mister.</i>

742
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:53,269
<i>In the name of the father…
–You made a fool of me.</i>

743
01:07:06,507 --> 01:07:07,576
Fa?

744
01:07:11,707 --> 01:07:12,901
Father?

745
01:07:32,907 --> 01:07:34,226
There are…

746
01:07:34,427 --> 01:07:39,787
<i>Father, there are monks in Bordeaux who
regularly dedicate their prayers to me.</i>

747
01:07:39,827 --> 01:07:42,665
who regularly dedicate
their prayers to me.

748
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:47,664
Do they, that's good.
–But the results have been unremarkable.

749
01:07:47,867 --> 01:07:49,285
We must be patient.

750
01:07:49,286 --> 01:07:51,707
<i>Yes, the doctors say that, too.</i>

751
01:07:51,747 --> 01:07:54,867
But Jean-Dominque,
I want to suggest something to you

752
01:07:54,907 --> 01:07:58,467
In a few weeks time, I shall be
leading a pilgrimage to Lourdes.

753
01:07:58,507 --> 01:07:59,497
<i>Lourdes?</i>

754
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:02,787
Dear Beatrice and I thought you
might want to be part of it.

755
01:08:02,827 --> 01:08:03,471
<i>This is a trap.</i>

756
01:08:03,511 --> 01:08:05,267
–There have been
some miraculous cures.

757
01:08:05,307 --> 01:08:06,214
That's true.

758
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:08,105
<i>I've been to Lourdes.</i>

759
01:08:33,627 --> 01:08:37,381
Let's stop and return.
–I am not turning back.

760
01:08:37,587 --> 01:08:39,907
Hit's my car, I'll drive where I like.

761
01:08:39,947 --> 01:08:43,107
You said you wanted a dirty weekend.
–I never said that.

762
01:08:43,147 --> 01:08:43,939
Yes you did.

763
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:47,459
Lourdes is not the right
place for a dirty week-end.

764
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:50,022
You've got a one-track mind.

765
01:08:52,267 --> 01:08:54,303
I want to see the Madonna.

766
01:08:56,507 --> 01:09:00,907
I don't believe in any of this.
–I want to see her and drink holy water.

767
01:09:00,947 --> 01:09:02,539
Spare me this.

768
01:09:04,627 --> 01:09:07,795
You should do that too.
It will be good for you.

769
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:15,424
Imposing, hm?

770
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:21,373
I'll buy some bottles for the holy water.

771
01:09:43,507 --> 01:09:49,059
That's it for me. I'm leaving.
–Stay. It could do you a lot of good.

772
01:09:49,267 --> 01:09:52,464
Don't be so sure, it might be dangerous.

773
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:54,997
What if someone in perfect
health happened to be here when

774
01:09:55,037 --> 01:09:55,836
the Madonna appeared?

775
01:09:55,876 --> 01:09:57,667
One miracle, and he'd end up paralyzed.

776
01:09:57,707 --> 01:09:59,186
You are terrible.

777
01:10:00,307 --> 01:10:02,423
Hello.
–Good day, madam.

778
01:10:02,627 --> 01:10:05,300
Look! Here's my Madonna!

779
01:10:07,747 --> 01:10:12,901
Forget it.
–Yeah, get out of my life.

780
01:10:14,187 --> 01:10:17,179
Okay, I'll give it to you as a present

781
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:23,297
Madame has a wonderful eye.
This Madonna been blessed by the Cardinal.

782
01:10:23,507 --> 01:10:26,544
Do we have more 318's?
–Look in the storage.

783
01:10:26,747 --> 01:10:30,023
How much is that?
-1899 franc.

784
01:10:35,387 --> 01:10:39,016
Don't we know each other?
–I don't think so, Mister.

785
01:10:41,627 --> 01:10:43,299
I don't have change.

786
01:10:45,547 --> 01:10:48,843
I can't make love to you
with her looking at me.

787
01:10:48,943 --> 01:10:49,984
–I understand.

788
01:10:50,707 --> 01:10:53,758
I wasn't stating a fact,
I was making a complaint.

789
01:10:53,798 --> 01:10:55,052
Let me turn her off

790
01:10:56,267 --> 01:10:57,416
No.

791
01:10:59,787 --> 01:11:03,700
The only one in the whole world.
Blessed by the Cardinal.

792
01:11:06,147 --> 01:11:10,701
Josephine, when we get back to Paris
we're going to have to split up.

793
01:11:11,787 --> 01:11:15,541
Because of her?
–No. Because of everything.

794
01:11:17,467 --> 01:11:20,459
Ok, you're right.

795
01:11:32,627 --> 01:11:36,336
I'll go out again.
–Turn off the lights.

796
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:40,458
But not my Madonna.

797
01:13:10,707 --> 01:13:12,489
La—la—la. Come on, Jean-Do.

798
01:13:16,907 --> 01:13:20,582
If you learn the L sound
you'll learn to swallow.

799
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:22,982
And you'll learn to say Lourdes.

800
01:13:31,347 --> 01:13:34,225
Is that okay?
Is it comfortable?

801
01:13:49,907 --> 01:13:53,867
<i>“The Pressure Cooker” could be
the title of the piece…</i>

802
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:57,183
<i>I'm writing about
my experiences here.</i>

803
01:13:57,387 --> 01:14:01,107
<i>I could also call it “The Eye”
or “The Diving Bell”.</i>

804
01:14:01,147 --> 01:14:03,787
<i>Plot and location are well known.</i>

805
01:14:03,867 --> 01:14:07,667
<i>In a hospital room, there's Mr L,
at the climax of his life…</i>

806
01:14:07,707 --> 01:14:13,259
<i>trying to live with locked-in syndrome
after a serious stroke.</i>

807
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:18,187
<i>Ambitious and somewhat cynical,
because he didn't know failures before…</i>

808
01:14:18,227 --> 01:14:21,663
<i>becomes acquainted with misfortune.</i>

809
01:14:21,867 --> 01:14:25,307
<i>We his slow transformation
listening to a commentarial voice…</i>

810
01:14:25,347 --> 01:14:28,107
<i>which tells the inner
monologue of Mr L.</i>

811
01:14:28,147 --> 01:14:31,307
<i>I already have the last scene.
It's night.</i>

812
01:14:31,347 --> 01:14:34,427
<i>Mr L, who was paralysed since
the beginning of the piece…</i>

813
01:14:34,467 --> 01:14:39,666
<i>suddenly jumps out of his bed
and runs over the darkly lit stage.</i>

814
01:14:39,867 --> 01:14:45,419
<i>Then it gets dark again and we hear
Mr L's commentarial voice:</i>

815
01:14:45,627 --> 01:14:47,475
<i>Fuck, it was a dream.</i>

816
01:15:16,027 --> 01:15:18,939
Stand up. I can stand up.

817
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:21,103
Everything is alright.

818
01:16:00,827 --> 01:16:04,061
“I want to remember how all this
happened to me.”

819
01:16:04,267 --> 01:16:05,985
Shall I ask someone?

820
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,056
No?

821
01:16:21,027 --> 01:16:23,985
Hello, room 119.
–Who's that?

822
01:16:26,627 --> 01:16:30,063
I'm Claude Mendibil.
I'm sitting with Jean-Do.

823
01:16:30,267 --> 01:16:32,266
<i>This is his father speaking.</i>

824
01:16:32,306 --> 01:16:34,738
–Yes, we were expecting your call.

825
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:41,540
So what do I do? Just talk?

826
01:16:42,627 --> 01:16:45,858
<i>Jean-Do can hear you.
He will answer you.</i>

827
01:16:46,027 --> 01:16:49,648
<i>You'll hear me saying
the alphabet and…</i>

828
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:51,499
–Yes, Céline told me.

829
01:16:54,747 --> 01:16:57,898
<i>Just talk, Monsieur Bauby.</i>

830
01:16:58,067 --> 01:16:59,705
Can he hear me?

831
01:17:01,627 --> 01:17:05,063
Jean-Dominique? This is Papinou.

832
01:17:07,987 --> 01:17:11,582
<i>I'm sitting at the open window.</i>

833
01:17:13,987 --> 01:17:17,377
<i>How are you or is that
a fool question?</i>

834
01:17:30,027 --> 01:17:32,018
Yes, it's a fool question.

835
01:17:35,747 --> 01:17:37,339
I miss you.

836
01:17:51,907 --> 01:17:53,659
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

837
01:17:56,307 --> 01:18:00,227
God Almighty! This is an impossible way to
conduct a conversation.

838
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:05,022
Everything goes out of my mind.
No, no, I've remembered.

839
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:11,141
<i>I'm sending you a present.
It's a surprise.</i>

840
01:18:15,627 --> 01:18:17,211
<i>I had a thought….</i>

841
01:18:18,307 --> 01:18:22,346
about us. We're in the same boat.

842
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:30,022
I'm stuck in this apartment.
I can't get up and down the stairs.

843
01:18:30,307 --> 01:18:35,301
<i>You try four flights of stairs
when you're ninety-two years old.</i>

844
01:18:37,267 --> 01:18:40,942
<i>we're both locked-in cases.</i>

845
01:18:41,147 --> 01:18:46,062
<i>You in your body and me
in my apartment.</i>

846
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:48,656
Jean-Dominique, remember…

847
01:18:48,867 --> 01:18:54,021
in the top right-hand drawer of my
writing desk there's a letter…

848
01:18:54,187 --> 01:19:00,023
In it are my last wishes. It's in a file…

849
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:07,616
marked “Miscellaneous”.

850
01:19:12,307 --> 01:19:14,298
<i>I must stop now.</i>

851
01:19:28,467 --> 01:19:32,380
Don't cry.
–That's easy to say.

852
01:19:32,587 --> 01:19:35,465
You're my son for Christ's sake.

853
01:19:36,707 --> 01:19:38,618
Good-bye, Jean-Dominique.

854
01:19:40,147 --> 01:19:43,184
I forgot, it's almost your birthday.

855
01:19:44,787 --> 01:19:46,345
<i>I'll call again.</i>

856
01:19:48,027 --> 01:19:50,018
<i>Happy Birthday.</i>

857
01:20:32,907 --> 01:20:38,584
<i>It can't be easy for a father to speak
to a son who he knows will never reply.</i>

858
01:20:57,467 --> 01:21:01,097
I thought an outing with
a new vista would do you good.

859
01:21:02,267 --> 01:21:05,942
I have another surprise for you.
Close your eyes.

860
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:10,104
Close your eyes.

861
01:21:16,027 --> 01:21:17,858
Okay, now open them.

862
01:21:18,027 --> 01:21:19,677
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

863
01:21:19,787 --> 01:21:23,826
<i>That was not necessary.
In two volumes.</i>

864
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:27,542
It's not a first edition,
but it's pretty old.

865
01:21:31,067 --> 01:21:34,895
Would you like me to read something to you?
Which chapter?

866
01:21:35,747 --> 01:21:40,298
<i>We should use Roman digits.
We didn't think of Roman digits.</i>

867
01:21:40,507 --> 01:21:43,107
<i>What would it be in Roman digits?</i>

868
01:21:43,147 --> 01:21:46,856
<i>That's L, I, X.</i>

869
01:21:47,907 --> 01:21:51,183
<i>That's faster. Next time.</i>

870
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:55,137
<i>50? Higher?
–Yes, higher.</i>

871
01:21:57,587 --> 01:21:59,418
Nine? 59? Ok.

872
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,221
Ok, there we go.

873
01:22:03,427 --> 01:22:07,783
<i>There's even an illustration.
The coincidence frightens me.</i>

874
01:22:08,067 --> 01:22:10,661
“They sat down beside him.”

875
01:22:11,787 --> 01:22:16,907
<i>“Noirtier was sitting in a wheelchair where
they put him from morning till evening…</i>

876
01:22:16,947 --> 01:22:21,187
<i>”in front of a mirror which allowed
him to see the whole apartment…</i>

877
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:22,679
<i>”without attempting any movement:</i>

878
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:26,267
”this was something that had
become impossible for him.

879
01:22:26,307 --> 01:22:29,211
”Sight and hearing were
the only two senses…

880
01:22:29,307 --> 01:22:33,425
which, like two sparks,
still lit up this human matter.”

881
01:22:34,187 --> 01:22:37,065
“…this human matter.”

882
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,940
<i>That's me, don't you think?</i>

883
01:22:41,987 --> 01:22:43,978
<i>But no.
–But yes.</i>

884
01:22:44,187 --> 01:22:47,304
<i>I frighten people, make them shudder.</i>

885
01:22:48,587 --> 01:22:49,625
You don't.

886
01:22:49,626 --> 01:22:52,899
<i>I should have stayed away from Dumas.</i>

887
01:22:53,107 --> 01:22:56,941
<i>Don't tamper with a masterpiece.
That's the lesson.</i>

888
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:02,931
<i>I didn't know Noirtier was the man
I was going to become.</i>

889
01:23:03,707 --> 01:23:07,627
<i>My diving bell has dragged you down
to the bottom of the sea with me…</i>

890
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:13,219
Jean-Do, I don't find it so bad that you
drag me down to the bottom of the sea…

891
01:23:13,427 --> 01:23:16,021
because you are also my butterfly.

892
01:23:17,507 --> 01:23:19,941
<i>That's a declaration of love.</i>

893
01:23:21,707 --> 01:23:24,301
<i>After we finish this book…</i>

894
01:23:24,427 --> 01:23:28,187
<i>we'll write another one about
a long-distance runner.</i>

895
01:23:28,227 --> 01:23:31,659
<i>You never know.
Perhaps I'll become like him…</i>

896
01:23:32,987 --> 01:23:35,581
“I missed you at the bullfight.

897
01:23:35,787 --> 01:23:39,063
I hope we meet again next year.
Jean-Paul.”

898
01:23:39,227 --> 01:23:41,502
Le Tango, Nîmes.

899
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:57,306
“Dear Mr Bauby,
the customized campmobile…

900
01:23:57,507 --> 01:24:04,504
can be delivered six to eight
weeks after your order.

901
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:08,007
Yours sincerely, Henri Raynaud.”
That's good news.

902
01:24:10,947 --> 01:24:12,778
This is from Papinou.

903
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:21,744
“This is a present.”

904
01:24:24,547 --> 01:24:27,505
Look, a photo of you as a kid.

905
01:24:29,467 --> 01:24:31,981
Jean-Do, aged eight, Berck sur Mer.

906
01:24:36,347 --> 01:24:37,826
From Anne-Marie.

907
01:24:42,027 --> 01:24:45,576
Jean-Dominique Bauby's room.
–Who are you?

908
01:24:45,787 --> 01:24:47,857
Céline Desmoulins. And you?

909
01:24:48,707 --> 01:24:53,223
<i>Inčs. I want to speak with Jean-Do.</i>

910
01:24:54,947 --> 01:24:56,175
One moment.

911
01:24:59,507 --> 01:25:02,419
I turned the speaker on, so he can hear you.

912
01:25:02,627 --> 01:25:05,937
<i>I can't speak with you there.</i>

913
01:25:06,147 --> 01:25:10,106
You have to, there's no one else.

914
01:25:10,267 --> 01:25:11,565
<i>Isn't the therapist there?</i>

915
01:25:11,605 --> 01:25:13,321
–No, she's not here today.

916
01:25:21,747 --> 01:25:22,816
<i>Darling?</i>

917
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:31,461
<i>I know I said I'd come but I got as far as
the train station and then turned back.</i>

918
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:33,340
<i>I just can't.</i>

919
01:25:34,427 --> 01:25:36,497
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

920
01:25:40,587 --> 01:25:41,541
<i>Céline?</i>

921
01:25:41,542 --> 01:25:42,305
–Yes.

922
01:25:42,467 --> 01:25:48,144
<i>Can't you just go out for a moment?
I have personal things to say.</i>

923
01:25:48,347 --> 01:25:49,542
<i>I feel embarrassed.</i>

924
01:25:49,582 --> 01:25:50,836
–I can't leave him.

925
01:25:51,027 --> 01:25:54,781
There's nobody else.
Wait, he wants to say something.

926
01:25:57,987 --> 01:25:59,386
O?

927
01:26:03,627 --> 01:26:04,821
One?

928
01:26:13,027 --> 01:26:14,983
One minute?

929
01:26:15,187 --> 01:26:17,860
I'm leaving. But not for long.

930
01:26:24,187 --> 01:26:27,224
<i>Jean-Do, are you alone now?</i>

931
01:26:30,827 --> 01:26:32,101
<i>Darling…</i>

932
01:26:33,427 --> 01:26:35,605
<i>I love you more than ever.</i>

933
01:26:37,467 --> 01:26:40,833
<i>I want to see you but I
haven't the courage.</i>

934
01:26:42,347 --> 01:26:45,119
<i>I want to think of you as you were.</i>

935
01:26:47,107 --> 01:26:49,021
<i>I hope you'll recover.</i>

936
01:26:50,667 --> 01:26:52,703
<i>I miss you.</i>

937
01:26:53,227 --> 01:26:57,459
<i>I miss you and I feel so alone.</i>

938
01:26:59,027 --> 01:27:01,257
<i>I know you understand.</i>

939
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:07,159
<i>You're in my thoughts all the time.</i>

940
01:27:13,547 --> 01:27:17,096
<i>I know your family
is always with you.</i>

941
01:27:22,067 --> 01:27:24,047
<i>Do you want me to come?</i>

942
01:27:25,267 --> 01:27:26,041
I'm back.

943
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:27,947
<i>Do you want me to come?</i>

944
01:27:27,987 --> 01:27:30,459
<i>Do you want me to come?</i>

945
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,265
–I'm back, Inčs.

946
01:28:03,787 --> 01:28:05,106
Every…

947
01:28:21,227 --> 01:28:23,183
Every day.

948
01:28:39,707 --> 01:28:41,379
Every day I'm…

949
01:29:02,667 --> 01:29:04,942
Every day I'm waiting for you.

950
01:29:05,227 --> 01:29:08,507
<i>I can't understand you.
Could you repeat that?</i>

951
01:29:08,547 --> 01:29:10,527
<i>I can't understand you.</i>

952
01:29:12,467 --> 01:29:15,061
He said: I'm waiting for you every day.

953
01:30:20,427 --> 01:30:25,581
If I don't get a seat on this plane,
I will miss my connection to Hong-Kong.

954
01:30:28,907 --> 01:30:31,626
Take mine.

955
01:30:32,027 --> 01:30:35,019
I'll take the next flight.
–Thank you.

956
01:30:35,867 --> 01:30:37,220
Have a good trip.

957
01:30:42,107 --> 01:30:45,935
But you're not going to Hong Kong
you are going to Beirut.

958
01:30:57,747 --> 01:31:00,466
Anything wrong? You don't feel good?

959
01:31:00,907 --> 01:31:03,182
Don't worry.

960
01:31:10,907 --> 01:31:13,133
<i>Most times I forget my dreams.</i>

961
01:31:13,173 --> 01:31:16,345
People who tell you
their dreams are tiresome.

962
01:31:17,467 --> 01:31:21,427
<i>But this one comes again and again.
I don't know why.</i>

963
01:31:21,787 --> 01:31:23,505
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

964
01:31:24,547 --> 01:31:28,222
<i>The feeling of doom wouldn't leave.</i>

965
01:31:28,427 --> 01:31:33,179
<i>It took what I can only describe as
a miracle to lift my spirits.</i>

966
01:31:34,867 --> 01:31:37,458
<i>It's dangerous to believe
in personal miracles.</i>

967
01:31:37,498 --> 01:31:39,787
<i>They tend to make one
feel self-important.</i>

968
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:45,107
<i>Nevertheless, I must report that I believe
something miraculous did occur</i>

969
01:31:45,947 --> 01:31:48,461
<i>I began to sing.</i>

970
01:31:49,947 --> 01:31:52,745
<i>I grunt, I sing.</i>

971
01:31:53,907 --> 01:31:57,947
<i>My hearing isn't great and sometimes
I think I hear my heart beating.</i>

972
01:31:57,987 --> 01:32:01,427
<i>But I tell myself it's the sound
of butterfly's wings.</i>

973
01:32:01,467 --> 01:32:06,187
<i>Yes, I am making indomitable progress and
I may even have butterfly hearing.</i>

974
01:32:06,227 --> 01:32:10,067
<i>I can look forward to the future.
Soon the summer will come to an end…</i>

975
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:13,869
<i>and I will begin my first
autumn in this hospital.</i>

976
01:32:15,067 --> 01:32:16,585
<i>My life is here.</i>

977
01:32:17,307 --> 01:32:19,485
<i>An everlasting repetition.</i>

978
01:32:20,547 --> 01:32:21,866
<i>Here.</i>

979
01:32:22,827 --> 01:32:24,704
How goes it?

980
01:32:26,587 --> 01:32:27,542
He's speaking!

981
01:32:28,507 --> 01:32:31,305
You're speaking.
–He can sing a song, too.

982
01:32:31,867 --> 01:32:36,304
Come on, sing for Laurent.
–Please, for me.

983
01:32:43,627 --> 01:32:47,905
<i> ♫ Le kangourou a sauté le mur
Le mur du zoo ♫ </i>

984
01:32:48,827 --> 01:32:53,051
<i> ♫ Mon Dieu qu'il était haut
Mon Dieu qu'il était beau ♫ </i>

985
01:32:54,467 --> 01:32:56,298
Are you ok?

986
01:32:56,507 --> 01:32:59,021
Does he sing?
–No, he doesn't.

987
01:33:17,907 --> 01:33:19,491
<i>I have pneumonia.</i>

988
01:33:22,227 --> 01:33:24,377
<i>Just when I thought…</i>

989
01:33:36,947 --> 01:33:41,352
<i>Like a sailor who watches
the shore gradually disappear.</i>

990
01:33:41,452 --> 01:33:43,432
<i>I watch my past recede.</i>

991
01:33:44,147 --> 01:33:47,264
<i>Becoming ashes of oblivion.</i>

992
01:34:02,467 --> 01:34:04,185
<i>What a comeback.</i>

993
01:34:04,787 --> 01:34:06,301
<i>That's where I worked.</i>

994
01:34:06,341 --> 01:34:10,961
<i>And that couple, I know them,
but I can't remember their names.</i>

995
01:34:11,747 --> 01:34:13,578
<i>That's my car!</i>

996
01:34:14,187 --> 01:34:16,143
<i>My new car.</i>

997
01:35:28,667 --> 01:35:30,578
Where is the horn?

998
01:36:13,347 --> 01:36:16,259
Let me hug you.
–See my car?

999
01:36:16,467 --> 01:36:18,219
Lovely.

1000
01:36:20,947 --> 01:36:22,699
Everything ok, Théo?

1001
01:36:23,147 --> 01:36:24,978
Had a good week?

1002
01:36:25,267 --> 01:36:29,943
Are we going to a theatre?
–To a theatre? If you want to.

1003
01:36:30,147 --> 01:36:33,856
Can we have oysters?
–Do you like oysters now?

1004
01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:40,703
Don't bring him back too late.

1005
01:36:43,227 --> 01:36:45,058
We are leaving.

1006
01:36:46,707 --> 01:36:50,825
Can I get in the front?
–Sure, there's no room in the back.

1007
01:36:57,627 --> 01:37:00,380
Soon I will take you too.

1008
01:37:01,027 --> 01:37:03,382
A little bit of wind?

1009
01:37:16,627 --> 01:37:20,222
Your team ok?
–Yeah, the players are ok.

1010
01:37:20,427 --> 01:37:26,536
You take a shower afterwards?
–We shower and wash our stuff.

1011
01:37:26,747 --> 01:37:30,422
Got pubic hair around your willy?
–No, not yet.

1012
01:37:30,627 --> 01:37:36,099
We had one guy who didn't
want to undress for the shower.

1013
01:37:36,307 --> 01:37:41,745
The club said he had to.
There was a fight.

1014
01:37:42,587 --> 01:37:47,377
He didn't do it.
His mother appeased him.

1015
01:37:48,147 --> 01:37:52,265
In the end,
he had to leave the team.

1016
01:37:55,427 --> 01:37:59,102
You don't have that problem, do you?

1017
01:38:02,667 --> 01:38:06,546
Other news? Everything ok with mom?
–Yeah, she's ok.

1018
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:10,376
You know this way?
–Yes, it's the way to Aunt Diane.

1019
01:38:12,027 --> 01:38:14,097
It's hot. You feel that, too?

1020
01:38:15,547 --> 01:38:17,617
No, I don't.

1021
01:38:21,347 --> 01:38:22,746
We have…

1022
01:38:24,387 --> 01:38:26,105
We have…

1023
01:38:36,227 --> 01:38:41,540
It might start to rain.
I'll stop for a moment.

1024
01:38:58,027 --> 01:39:00,416
Dad, what's the matter?

1025
01:39:50,867 --> 01:39:53,017
Phone your mother!

1026
01:39:54,787 --> 01:39:59,383
My last thought was we'll have to cancel
going to the theatre.

1027
01:39:59,547 --> 01:40:04,575
We'd be late in any case.
We'll go tomorrow night.

1028
01:40:05,587 --> 01:40:07,782
And then I sank into a coma.

1029
01:40:46,187 --> 01:40:48,303
Is it a book?

1030
01:40:58,467 --> 01:41:01,459
For Théophile, Céleste and Hortense.

1031
01:41:01,627 --> 01:41:04,824
I wish them lots of butterflies.

1032
01:41:07,267 --> 01:41:10,027
And my deepest gratitude
to Claude Mendibil.

1033
01:41:10,067 --> 01:41:15,300
You'll understand that without her
this book couldn't have been written.

1034
01:41:46,067 --> 01:41:47,783
I was here the whole time.

1035
01:41:48,107 --> 01:41:49,381
You know that.

1036
01:41:52,547 --> 01:41:55,847
These reviews are terrific!
You want to hear them?

1037
01:41:55,867 --> 01:42:00,065
The man who dictates in silence.
Without gestures or speech.

1038
01:42:00,267 --> 01:42:05,057
Jean-Dominque Bauby communicates
with an eyelid and writes this book.

1039
01:42:05,267 --> 01:42:10,421
A touching visit at the
wreckage of abandonment.

1040
01:42:10,587 --> 01:42:12,066
By Bernard Chapuis.

1041
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:14,498
“A touching book.”

1042
01:42:21,067 --> 01:42:24,301
Jean-Dominique Bauby,

1043
01:42:24,373 --> 01:42:26,300

projetait d'écrire un roman

1045

1049
01:43:29,267 --> 01:43:30,938
Couldn't find English subs,
so I created them myself

1050
01:43:30,978 --> 01:43:33,468
using an English version of the
script and several online dictionaries

1051
01:43:33,508 --> 01:43:35,056
But as a German, I'm no
English native speaker

1052
01:43:35,096 --> 01:43:37,961
so please excuse any misspellings or other
flaws. Hope you enjoyed as much as I did.
