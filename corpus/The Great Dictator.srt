00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:56,955
<i>In the last year of the World War,
the Tomainian nation began to weaken.</i>

2
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,957
<i>Behind her lines
revolution had broken out.</i>

3
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,959
<i>Her diplomats were frantically
suing for peace...</i>

4
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:03,212
<i>while at the front
Tomainia's army fought on...</i>

5
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,214
<i>confident its war machine
was invincible...</i>

6
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:07,966
<i>confident its war machine
would smash the enemy's lines.</i>

7
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:10,969
<i>Big Bertha, a cannon that could
hurl a projectile a hundred miles...</i>

8
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:13,639
<i>was this day to make
its first appearance on the Western Front...</i>

9
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:16,391
<i>was this day to strike terror
into the hearts of the enemy.</i>

10
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:20,812
<i>Seventy-five miles away was her target,
the cathedral of Notre Dame.</i>

11
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:26,527
Range: 95,452!

12
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:29,071
- Range: 95,452!
- Yes, sir!

13
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:31,698
- Stand clear!
- Fire!

14
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:50,717
Hey!
Stand by your trigger.

15
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:52,344
Yes, sir.

16
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:56,098
Range correction: 95,455!

17
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:58,767
- Range: 95,455!
- Yes, sir!

18
00:03:59,644 --> 00:04:01,103
Breach secured!

19
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,354
Stand clear!

20
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:04,106
Ready! Fire!

21
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:22,749
Defective shell.
We'll examine it. Come on.

22
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:28,005
Come on.

23
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,137
- We'd better check the fuse.
- Yes, check the fuse.

24
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:37,222
Yes, sir. The fuse.

25
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:13,258
Look out! Come on! Run!

26
00:05:28,232 --> 00:05:29,983
- What's that?
- An air raid!

27
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:32,819
- They're after Big Bertha!
- Right! To the antiaircraft gun!

28
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:34,571
- To the gun!
- Quick!

29
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:02,766
Hey! Have you gone crazy?

30
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,851
Come down out of there!

31
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,405
Get up there, will you!

32
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:18,907
What do you think you're doing?
Have you gone crazy?

33
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:21,034
- Sorry, sir -
- Sir! Report from Captain Snout!

34
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,161
The enemy have broken through!
Every man to the front!

35
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:26,039
Muster the gun crew, quick!
You, report to Sergeant Bloom.

36
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:27,624
- Come on!
- Yes, sir!

37
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:30,252
Get your hand grenades there, soldiers.

38
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,045
Come on there.
Get your hand grenades.

39
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,548
Hey, soldier! Where's your hand grenade?
Hey, come here!

40
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:36,550
- Where's your hand grenade?
- Haven't got any, sir.

41
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:38,552
Give him a hand grenade.
Go on.

42
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:45,183
Keep moving. Come along.
Move forward.

43
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:47,269
Hurry it up.
Come along. Hurry up.

44
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,771
Pardon me, sir, but to work this -
How do you -

45
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,857
Pull the pin, count 10 and throw it.

46
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:06,371
Let 'em have it!

47
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,301
Hey, come on!

48
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:29,352
Hey, this is no time to scratch.

49
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:36,067
Here, pull yourself together.

50
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:37,652
Take this.

51
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:39,988
Forward!

52
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,450
Hey, you men! Fall in here!

53
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:46,077
Hey, you, come on!
Hurry it up there!

54
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,417
Order! Arms!

55
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,463
Prepare to attack!

56
00:07:56,547 --> 00:07:58,006
Forward!

57
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:12,896
Captain!

58
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:23,573
<i>Capitán!</i>

59
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,842
There you are.

60
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,185
Oh, excuse me!

61
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,188
The enemy!
Come on, fellas! Let's get him!

62
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:04,614
Good afternoon, sir. May I come in?

63
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,783
- Who is it?
- Friend.

64
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:08,535
Come in.

65
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,372
- Sir.
- What division?

66
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:13,874
21 st Artillery, sir.

67
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,876
Take this. Hold 'em off.
And keep firing.

68
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,961
- I'll be back in a moment.
- Yes, sir.

69
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:37,647
Help! Comrade, help!

70
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:45,739
- What is it?
- I'm exhausted.

71
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:47,866
Quick! Help me to my plane!

72
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,951
Yes, sir.

73
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:52,621
- Thank you, my lad.
- Steady.

74
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,956
I'll see you get
the Tomainian Cross for this.

75
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,876
That's all right, sir.
I'm only too willing to oblige.

76
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,303
Oh, you saved my life.

77
00:10:08,387 --> 00:10:10,472
- Thank you.
- I'll strap you in.

78
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,724
I'm weak.
I can't make it alone.

79
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:14,768
- You'll have to stay with me.
- All right, sir.

80
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:17,145
- Can you fly a plane?
- I can try.

81
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,943
Quick! Lift my hand to the stick.
I haven't the strength.

82
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:26,112
- Take charge of that gun, Sergeant!
- Yes, sir!

83
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:29,741
The enemy! They're coming!
Quick! Lift my hand to the throttle!

84
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:32,869
We'll fool 'em!

85
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:56,309
- Here. Hold on to these dispatches.
- Yes, sir.

86
00:10:56,394 --> 00:11:00,021
If we can deliver them to General Schmelloffel,
Tomainia may yet win the day!

87
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,151
- I think I'm going to faint.
- Oh, don't say that.

88
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:07,278
I'm sorry, old man.

89
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:09,155
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

90
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,241
Oh, wait - Please! Hey!

91
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:13,159
Hey, mister!

92
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:16,871
- Hey!
- Where am I?

93
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:19,165
- Don't you know me?
- Oh, yes. Of course.

94
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,834
- Of course.
- Yes.

95
00:11:20,918 --> 00:11:23,003
Yes, I - I feel better now.

96
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:25,547
- Ah.
- The blood's returning to my head.

97
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,424
What's below?

98
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:29,509
- Looks like the sun.
- The sun?

99
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:32,303
- Seems to be shining upwards.
- Strange.

100
00:11:32,388 --> 00:11:35,015
- How's the gas?
- Terrible. It kept me awake all night.

101
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:37,183
No, no, no!
The gasoline in the tank!

102
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:39,352
Oh. Almost empty.

103
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:42,355
We must be nearly there.
What time is it?

104
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,815
Time?

105
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,235
About, approximately, one minute to 12:00.

106
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,950
Strange.

107
00:11:55,244 --> 00:11:56,870
Look at that.

108
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,126
Seem to be defying
the laws of gravity.

109
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:09,716
Water!

110
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,217
- Huh?
- Quick! I'm going to faint!

111
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:13,595
Uh, wait a while. Wait a wh -

112
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,765
You'll get - We'll get into trouble
if you faint any more now.

113
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:18,349
- Ohh. Ohh.
- Now be careful.

114
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:19,726
- Here now. Just hold it.
- Quick.

115
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,896
Hold it. Hold it. I think I can - We'll just see -

116
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,356
Faint. Water.

117
00:12:27,443 --> 00:12:29,944
- What on -
- Oh, water.

118
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,405
- Here, take it!
- Oh! Quick!

119
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,574
There's something wrong.

120
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:36,451
Oh, I can't reach it.

121
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:39,162
Oh, water! Faint!

122
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:41,247
Ah! Oh, it's all gone!

123
00:12:41,332 --> 00:12:43,041
What's the matter?

124
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,293
- This belt is too tight.
- Well, loosen it.

125
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:46,795
I'm trying to.

126
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:50,423
We're upside down.

127
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:52,425
- I know it.
- Give me that stick!

128
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,760
Impossible.

129
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:55,720
Oh. There it goes.

130
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:57,514
We're out of gas.

131
00:12:57,598 --> 00:13:00,600
Well, I suppose this is the end.

132
00:13:00,684 --> 00:13:02,519
- Cigarette?
- Not now.

133
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:04,604
Then I shan't need this anymore.

134
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:06,272
What month is it?

135
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:07,690
April.

136
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:10,026
Spring in Tomainia.

137
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:13,613
Hilda will be in the garden now
tending the daffodils.

138
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:16,282
How she loves daffodils.

139
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:19,494
She would never cut them
for fear of hurting them.

140
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:23,206
It was like taking a life
to cut a daffodil.

141
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,251
Sweet, gentle Hilda.

142
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,008
A beautiful soul.

143
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:36,177
And she loved animals.

144
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:38,388
And little children too.

145
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:45,937
We've landed! Dispatches!

146
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:47,981
Comrade, where are you?

147
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:49,399
Comrade!

148
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:57,448
Comrade, the dispatches!
Tell me, where are they?

149
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:02,745
- Are you hurt?
- Quick! Take me to General Schmelloffel!

150
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,122
- What's that?
- Hurry, man!

151
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:07,083
If I don't deliver these dispatches at once,
we're defeated!

152
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:08,585
- Well, the war's over.
- What?

153
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:10,461
- We lost.
- Lost?

154
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,976
<i>Hynkel Party Takes Power!</i>

155
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:09,979
<i>Meanwhile, the Jewish soldier,
ex-barber, veteran of the World War...</i>

156
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:13,399
<i>suffered a loss of memory and remained an inmate
of the soldier's hospital for many years.</i>

157
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:16,277
<i>He was ignorant of the profound change
that had come over Tomainia.</i>

158
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:19,030
<i>Hynkel the dictator ruled the nation
with an iron fist.</i>

159
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:21,699
<i>Under the new emblem of the Double Cross
liberty was banished...</i>

160
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:23,243
<i>free speech was suppressed...</i>

161
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:25,453
<i>and only the voice of Hynkel was heard.</i>

162
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:32,001
<i>...und ze sauerkraut!</i>

163
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:50,019
Baloney.

164
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:53,106
Baloney -

165
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,708
<i>Adenoid Hynkel has just said...</i>

166
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,794
<i>yesterday Tomainia was down,
but today she has risen.</i>

167
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:34,314
<i>Democratzy shtunk!</i>

168
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:36,107
<i>Democracy is fragrant.</i>

169
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:38,109
<i>Liberty shtunk!</i>

170
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:39,986
<i>Liberty is odious.</i>

171
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,488
<i>Free sprechen shtunk!</i>

172
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:44,991
<i>Freedom of speech is objectionable.</i>

173
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,496
<i>Tomainia has the greatest army in the world.</i>

174
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,500
<i>The greatest navy in the world.</i>

175
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:01,257
<i>But to remain great we must sacrifice.</i>

176
00:17:04,636 --> 00:17:06,554
<i>We must tighten our belts.</i>

177
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:07,930
Hail Hynkel!

178
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:21,110
Ah, Herring.
Poopschen Herring.

179
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:22,945
Bismarck Herring!

180
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,199
<i>The Phooey now speaks to
the Field Marshal Herring, the minister of war.</i>

181
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:31,037
From the hearten...

183
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,379
<i>He is now addressing
Herr Garbitsch, Minister of the Interior.</i>

184
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:41,923
Herr Garbitsch.

185
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:44,050
<i>Herring shutten smelten fine

00:17:46,637 --> 00:17:49,263
<i>Herring und Garbitsch.</i>

188
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:52,266
<i>His Excellency
recalls the struggles of his early days...</i>

189
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:54,727
<i>shared by his two loyal comrades.</i>

190
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,711
Ah, und the Aryan...

192
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,298
Ah, the Aryan maiden.

<i>Der Juden.</i>

<i>Ohh, der Juden.</i>

208
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:32,241
<i>His Excellency
has just referred to the Jewish people.</i>

209
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:42,668
<i>Und now...</i>

210
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:55,598
Europe...

211
00:19:55,682 --> 00:19:58,601
<i>Blitzkrieg French...</i>

<i>In conclusion, the Phooey remarks...</i>

217
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:31,175
<i>that for the rest of the world
he has nothing but peace in his heart.</i>

218
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:03,666
<i>We now pause for station identification.</i>

219
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,668
<i>This is the Peri-mutuel Network...</i>

220
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:08,170
<i>bringing you direct from Tomainia
Adenoid Hynkel's address...</i>

221
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:10,172
<i>to the sons and daughters

222
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:14,176
<i>The English Interpreter is Heinrich Schtick,
Adenoid Hynkel's personal translator...</i>

223
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:16,679
<i>who is apparently reading
from a prepared manuscript.</i>

224
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:18,681
<i>Stand by for further commentary.</i>

225
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,558
<i>Go ahead, Tomainia.</i>

226
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:23,311
<i>His Excellency is about to descend the stairs.</i>

227
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:32,236
Ach! Ohh! Your Excellency!

228
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:34,447
Are you hurt?

229
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:37,116
<i>Straff! Straff da fluten flavin

<i>Da banana!</i>

<i>- Da banana!

233
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:51,797
<i>- Banana!
- Banana!</i>

234
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:55,384
<i>Dein big booben!
Cheesen crackers!</i>

235
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:56,886
<i>Banana.</i>

236
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:05,353
Inside, da booben.

237
00:22:05,437 --> 00:22:07,938
You ride in the other car.

238
00:22:12,402 --> 00:22:14,070
Thank you, children.

239
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:17,907
<i>His Excellency seems well pleased...</i>

240
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:22,495
<i>as he's greeted by a committee
of Tomainian children and their mothers.</i>

241
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:25,790
<i>Now he pauses
before a woman with a child.</i>

242
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:30,002
Camera.

243
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,004
<i>Even the baby is thrilled...</i>

244
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:34,715
<i>and seems all smiles
at His Excellency's attention.</i>

245
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:59,365
Hail Hynkel!

246
00:22:59,449 --> 00:23:01,784
<i>His Excellency leaves
the scene of his triumph...</i>

247
00:23:01,868 --> 00:23:04,787
<i>and will return to the palace along
Hynkelstrasse, the avenue of culture...</i>

248
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:07,123
<i>where he will pass Tomainia's
modern masterpieces...</i>

249
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:09,709
The Venus of Today
and The Thinker of Tomorrow.

250
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:20,052
- How was it?
- The speech?

251
00:23:20,137 --> 00:23:22,304
- Yes.
- Oh, very good.

252
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:25,641
Thought your reference to the Jews
might have been a little more violent.

253
00:23:25,726 --> 00:23:28,477
- What?
- You've got to rouse the people's anger.

254
00:23:28,562 --> 00:23:33,065
At this time, violence against the Jews
might take the public's mind off its stomach.

255
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,067
Hmm. Perhaps you're right.

256
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:37,737
Things have been quiet
in the ghetto lately.

257
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:03,429
Good morning, Mr. Jaeckel.

258
00:24:03,513 --> 00:24:05,181
What's good about it?

259
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:07,266
Well, conditions could be worse.

260
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,770
If you think they could be worse,
you have a great imagination.

261
00:24:10,854 --> 00:24:13,063
Aha. You heard Hynkel's speech.

262
00:24:13,148 --> 00:24:16,400
I heard nothing.
I've got my own troubles.

263
00:24:16,485 --> 00:24:19,403
Well, you're better off
than a lot of other people.

264
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:22,782
- What have you heard from the barber?
- Still in the hospital.

265
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:25,534
Aye. Ever since the war
he's been there.

266
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:26,869
Yep.

267
00:24:26,953 --> 00:24:29,580
Why don't you try and rent
his barbershop for him?

268
00:24:29,664 --> 00:24:31,624
He won't let me.

269
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:34,460
Every few weeks
he writes to say he's coming back.

270
00:24:34,544 --> 00:24:37,630
It seems a pity it should be idle
all these years.

271
00:24:37,714 --> 00:24:39,632
Well, why worry?

272
00:24:39,716 --> 00:24:42,802
With the taxes the government
will soon take it away from him.

273
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:44,595
Aye, perhaps you're right.

274
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:46,806
It isn't such a good morning after all.

275
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,891
Now you said it.

276
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:52,645
- Hannah.
- Yes, Mr. Jaeckel?

277
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:55,648
On the mantelpiece
you'll find my tobacco pouch.

278
00:24:55,732 --> 00:24:58,025
- Will you get it?
- All right, Mr. Jaeckel.

279
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:01,153
Yeah, seems everyone
is full of troubles.

280
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:02,988
Ah, everyone.

281
00:25:03,073 --> 00:25:04,990
Look at Hannah, poor girl.

282
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:07,493
A hard worker.
Can't get a job.

283
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:11,038
Father was killed in the war.
Mother died last year.

284
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:14,667
Can't earn enough to pay the rent
for her room. What can I do?

285
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,752
I can't throw her out.

286
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:27,721
- You'll need some more tobacco.
- Where are you going?

287
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:29,557
I'm delivering Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry.

288
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:31,976
Oh, you'd better take the key.

289
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,395
Mrs. Jaeckel and myself
are going out.

290
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,397
I'm locking up all the doors...

291
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:39,483
in case the storm troopers will start
their monkey business again.

292
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,622
# The Aryan #

293
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:57,126
<i># The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #</i>

294
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,462
# As we go marching by ##

295
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,465
Look, fellas! Tomatoes!

296
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,050
And potatoes!

297
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:09,638
I think I'll take a box home.

298
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:12,975
Mister, please, please.

299
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:15,227
Hey, fellas, the truck!

300
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:17,813
Hold it there, will ya!

301
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:21,317
You have no right to do this.

302
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:24,320
That's all right.
Just charge it to my account.

303
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:28,782
Nice, ripe tomatoes, boys!

304
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:33,245
Why don't some of you do something?
I wish I was a man. I'd show ya.

305
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,581
Now what would you do,
my pretty maid?

306
00:26:35,665 --> 00:26:39,335
Ah, you're very brave all together, but not
one of ya got guts to stand up alone and fight.

307
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,837
- Aw, shut up!
- Is that why you got a truck?

308
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:44,840
- To run away in case somebody hits you back?
- Shut up, or we'll take you down.

309
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:47,843
All right, come on and take me.
You'll get a lot of medals for it.

310
00:26:47,928 --> 00:26:50,763
That's all you can do is to pick on women
and rob defenseless people.

311
00:26:50,847 --> 00:26:54,266
Aw, don't rob the poor girl, boys.
Give her back her tomatoes.

312
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:55,851
Here!

313
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,309
Oh, I'll have to do it all over again.

314
00:27:39,562 --> 00:27:41,105
Pigs.

315
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:47,403
<i>- Send in patient 33.
- Yes, sir.</i>

316
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:49,071
Here's an interesting case.

317
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:51,240
Amnesia. Jewish soldier.

318
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:54,660
Been here since the war.
Has an idea he's been here only a few weeks.

319
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:56,954
Has he any idea
what's happened in the meantime?

320
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:58,455
Not the least.

321
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:03,252
His one interest seems to be in his barbershop,
which he believes he left only a few weeks ago.

322
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:05,754
Poor devil. He'll have
many surprises waiting for him.

323
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,090
I'm afraid so.

324
00:28:08,174 --> 00:28:10,175
<i>- Yes?
- Number 33 is gone.</i>

325
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,177
Gone?
But he was to be examined.

326
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:15,180
<i>- I know, sir, but he disappeared.
- Disappeared?</i>

327
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:18,517
Well, let him go.
It isn't a serious case.

328
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:21,103
Besides, there's little more
we can do for him.

329
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:47,689
Hey, go on.
Beat it up there.

330
00:29:47,774 --> 00:29:50,109
Come on! Get outta -
You! Go on!

331
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:17,302
What do you think you're doing?

332
00:30:17,387 --> 00:30:20,139
- I really don't know.
- Well, you leave that alone.

333
00:30:21,391 --> 00:30:23,600
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not silly!

334
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:25,102
I appreciate that.

335
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:27,563
When you talk to me,
hail Hynkel and salute.

336
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:29,148
Who are you anyway?

337
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:33,068
I'll show you who I am.

338
00:30:33,153 --> 00:30:34,820
Come down to headquarters.

339
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:37,823
- Say, that's my shop!
- I don't care if it is or not.

340
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:40,659
- You leave me alone!
- Oh! Gonna put up a fight, are ya?

341
00:30:40,743 --> 00:30:43,829
Come on down, pal.
I'll show you.

342
00:30:43,913 --> 00:30:46,331
Now let me tell you something -

343
00:30:49,502 --> 00:30:52,588
Are you a policeman?
Arrest that man for assault.

344
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,590
- Come here, you!
- Leave me alone!

345
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:57,217
Attacking a storm trooper, huh?

346
00:30:57,302 --> 00:30:58,969
- Take him down!
- You'll hear from my lawyer!

347
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:01,680
- Come on, you little -
- Why, you -

348
00:31:01,764 --> 00:31:04,808
Turn him around!

349
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:07,186
He bit my finger!

350
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:42,679
<i>Pardon.</i>

351
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:01,114
Oh, I'm sorry, mister.
I didn't mean to hit you.

352
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:03,158
You were wonderful.
I enjoyed that.

353
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:06,078
- But don't stand there. You'd better beat it.
- No, I'll call a policeman.

354
00:32:06,162 --> 00:32:07,788
- No, no, don't do that.
- Why not?

355
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:09,581
You crazy?

356
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,583
- Look out. There's more coming.
- More what?

357
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,377
Wait a minute!

358
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:21,009
Come in here!

359
00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:26,431
What's wrong with you?
There's no use being foolhardy.

360
00:32:26,516 --> 00:32:28,183
- Who?
- Shh!

361
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:33,897
Stop the car!

362
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:38,443
Hello! What's this?
Who hit you?

363
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:42,698
- I don't know. I think there were a gang of 'em.
- Here, you'd better go along, get fixed up.

364
00:32:42,782 --> 00:32:44,408
We'll investigate later.

365
00:32:44,492 --> 00:32:46,743
- What time is it?
- Come on. Get in.

366
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:56,795
I don't see what is -

367
00:33:06,973 --> 00:33:09,141
It's all right now.
They've gone.

368
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:10,809
Thanks, mister.

369
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:13,020
That did me a lot of good.

370
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:18,483
You sure got nerve,
the way you fought back.

371
00:33:18,568 --> 00:33:21,278
That's what we should all do -
fight back.

372
00:33:21,362 --> 00:33:24,781
We can't fight alone,
but we can lick 'em together.

373
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:28,493
We didn't do so bad, did we?

374
00:33:28,578 --> 00:33:30,287
So long.

375
00:33:47,597 --> 00:33:49,097
Oh, excuse me.

376
00:33:49,182 --> 00:33:52,184
You're the barber,
the one that was in the hospital.

377
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:56,480
Mr. Jaeckel's often talked about you.
We didn't think you were ever coming back.

378
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:00,859
But the storm troopers,
they'll be looking for ya.

379
00:34:00,943 --> 00:34:02,194
Storm troopers?

380
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:05,489
You'd better hide.
Wait. I'll get the key to the cellar.

381
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:15,791
- Is this the man?
- That's him.

382
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:18,043
Hail Hynkel.

383
00:34:18,127 --> 00:34:19,294
Who's he?

384
00:34:19,962 --> 00:34:23,048
Don't fool with me.
I said, hail Hynkel!

385
00:34:23,132 --> 00:34:25,300
- All right.
- Put out your hands.

386
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:28,637
Just a moment. We won't put 'em on here.
Bring him outside.

387
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:31,139
Yes. Come on, you.
Come on!

388
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:35,727
Before we take you down
you'll finish this. Here.

389
00:34:37,438 --> 00:34:38,814
Go on. Paint that.

390
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:41,149
Why, you -

391
00:34:52,912 --> 00:34:54,746
That's him!

392
00:35:17,812 --> 00:35:20,063
Wait a minute, boys! Wait a minute!

393
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:22,607
I've got an idea.
A bright idea.

394
00:35:22,692 --> 00:35:25,026
Sure! That's it!

395
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:37,289
- And... give it the works!
- Heave ho!

396
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,792
Wait a minute! Commander Schultz!

397
00:35:41,544 --> 00:35:42,919
Attention!

398
00:35:46,757 --> 00:35:48,550
First in command.

399
00:35:49,844 --> 00:35:51,887
- Yes, sir.
- What the -

400
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:53,889
Second in command.

401
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:56,975
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, never mind.

402
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:58,310
- You!
- Yes, sir.

403
00:35:58,394 --> 00:36:00,937
What the devil goes on here? And who
told you to hang people from lampposts?

404
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:03,648
- No one, sir.
- My orders were to keep these streets tidy.

405
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:06,193
- What was the trouble?
- A Jew was attacking storm troopers, sir.

406
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:08,320
- Where is he?
- There.

407
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:10,071
Break ranks.

408
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:15,452
Oh, so there you are.
Stand him up.

409
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,787
Get up.

410
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:24,544
You!

411
00:36:25,546 --> 00:36:27,672
Don't you remember me?

412
00:36:27,757 --> 00:36:29,674
The war.
You saved my life.

413
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:32,052
- Me?
- Strange.

414
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:34,679
And I always thought of you as an Aryan.

415
00:36:34,764 --> 00:36:36,723
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Well, don't you remember?

416
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:39,768
The enemy tried to capture us,
but we got away in my plane.

417
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:41,269
Plane?

418
00:36:41,354 --> 00:36:43,939
And then we crashed.

419
00:36:44,023 --> 00:36:45,690
Cra -

420
00:36:48,277 --> 00:36:50,278
Oh, yes.

421
00:36:50,363 --> 00:36:52,030
Now I remember.

422
00:36:53,616 --> 00:36:56,159
- Well, how are you?
- What has my friend done?

423
00:36:56,244 --> 00:36:58,662
Our men were painting his windows,
Commander, and he resisted.

424
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:00,747
Any brave man would resist.

425
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:03,750
- I'm sorry this occurred.
- Oh. No harm.

426
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:06,920
I'm sure that in the future
you will not be molested again.

427
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:10,465
However, if you or your friends are ever
in any trouble, I hope you'll let me know.

428
00:37:13,135 --> 00:37:14,678
Who did that?

429
00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:17,806
Oh. One of my friends.

430
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:21,268
Oh. Of course.

431
00:37:27,483 --> 00:37:30,402
<i>Hynkel's palace was
the center of a gigantic enterprise...</i>

432
00:37:30,486 --> 00:37:33,405
<i>an enterprise that would build
the world's greatest war machine.</i>

433
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:36,408
<i>Behind this undertaking was
the dynamic energy of Adenoid Hynkel...</i>

434
00:37:36,492 --> 00:37:38,410
<i>whose amazing genius
ran the entire nation...</i>

435
00:37:38,494 --> 00:37:42,497
<i>whose ceaseless activity kept him
busily occupied every moment of the day.</i>

436
00:37:46,752 --> 00:37:48,253
Hup!

437
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:11,818
<i>Marshal Herring is waiting,
Your Excellency.</i>

438
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:13,194
Enough.

439
00:38:15,323 --> 00:38:16,573
Hail Hynkel.

440
00:38:16,657 --> 00:38:19,242
Your Excellency,
I believe we've got something now.

441
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:22,621
A bulletproof uniform.
Material as light as silk.

442
00:38:22,705 --> 00:38:25,665
- Where is it?
- I've arranged for a demonstration in the anteroom.

443
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,751
It will only take two minutes.

444
00:38:28,753 --> 00:38:30,420
I can spare one.

445
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,302
- Professor Herr Kibitzen!
- Hail Hynkel!

446
00:38:37,386 --> 00:38:39,929
Your Excellency,
actions speak louder than words.

447
00:38:40,014 --> 00:38:43,433
- A bulletproof uniform!
- And 100% perfect!

448
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:46,519
Shoot.

449
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:53,652
Far from perfect.

450
00:39:31,107 --> 00:39:33,400
Zevell!

451
00:39:36,362 --> 00:39:38,780
- My secretary. Where is she?
- In the outer office, Your Excellency.

452
00:39:38,864 --> 00:39:40,198
- Call her.
- Yes, sir.

453
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:50,792
Hail Hynkel.

454
00:39:52,461 --> 00:39:54,129
Take a letter.

455
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:10,186
No! No, no!

456
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:21,322
<i>- Hello?
- This is Field Marshal Herring.</i>

457
00:40:21,407 --> 00:40:23,908
<i>I'm in the Tower Room.
We've got something marvelous.</i>

458
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:25,994
All right. I shall be up.

459
00:40:42,094 --> 00:40:43,762
- What is it?
- A parachute.

460
00:40:43,846 --> 00:40:47,432
The most compact in the world.
Worn like an ordinary hat.

461
00:40:49,602 --> 00:40:51,603
It will open in 25 feet.

462
00:40:51,687 --> 00:40:53,688
Demonstrate, Professor.

463
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,947
Hail Hynkel!

464
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:16,961
Herring, why do you
waste my time like this?

465
00:41:28,682 --> 00:41:30,183
Send Garbitsch here.

466
00:41:40,402 --> 00:41:42,987
<i>Herr Garbitsch is waiting, Your Excellency.</i>

467
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:44,739
Enough.

468
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:49,953
Hail Hynkel.

469
00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:52,038
Garbitsch, what's the meaning of this,
these appropriations?

470
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:55,667
25 million for prison camps when we need
every penny for the manufacturing of munitions.

471
00:41:55,751 --> 00:41:58,169
- We've had to make a few arrests.
- A few? How many?

472
00:41:58,254 --> 00:41:59,921
Nothing astronomical.
Five or ten thousand.

473
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:01,506
- Oh.
- A day.

474
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,675
- A day?
- Just a few dissenters, that's all.

475
00:42:03,759 --> 00:42:06,886
- What do they dissent about?
- The working hours. The cut in wages.

476
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:10,598
Chiefly, the synthetic food -
the quality of the sawdust in the bread.

477
00:42:10,683 --> 00:42:14,435
What more do they want? It's from
the finest lumber our mills can supply.

478
00:42:16,897 --> 00:42:19,524
Nevertheless,
the condition is getting dangerous.

479
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:21,526
The people are overworked.
They need diversion.

480
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,861
The people? Bah!

481
00:42:22,945 --> 00:42:26,155
We might go a little further with the Jews.
Burn down some of their houses.

482
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,033
Spectacular assault on the ghetto now
might prove diverting.

483
00:42:29,118 --> 00:42:32,203
We must do something more dramatic.
Now is the time to invade Osterlich.

484
00:42:32,288 --> 00:42:34,706
- How soon can we be ready?
- According to Herring, three months.

485
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:38,251
I can't wait that long. Besides, Napaloni's army
might invade Osterlich before me.

486
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:39,711
We must strike now.

487
00:42:39,795 --> 00:42:41,838
In that case,
we should require foreign capital.

488
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:44,716
- Borrow it. Borrow it.
- The bankers have all refused.

489
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,677
But wait. There's one man
who might make us a loan - Epstein.

490
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:50,013
Epstein?
He's a Jew, isn't he?

491
00:42:50,097 --> 00:42:51,890
Yes.

492
00:42:51,974 --> 00:42:55,476
Well, let's be big about it.
We'll borrow the money from Epstein.

493
00:42:56,645 --> 00:43:00,064
It might be difficult
in view of our policy towards his people.

494
00:43:00,149 --> 00:43:02,483
Very well then.
We'll change our policy towards his people.

495
00:43:02,568 --> 00:43:06,237
Tell Commander Schultz that in future
all persecution of the Jews must cease...

496
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:09,699
at least until
we've negotiated this loan.

497
00:43:15,915 --> 00:43:17,498
I don't understand it.

498
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,959
The whole ghetto is so quiet now.

499
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:23,087
You can't imagine what was going on
while you were away.

500
00:43:23,172 --> 00:43:25,757
Oh, this Hynkel business.

501
00:43:25,841 --> 00:43:29,677
You weren't here.
You were in the hospital, unconscious.

502
00:43:29,762 --> 00:43:32,889
Believe me, you don't appreciate
what a good time you were having.

503
00:43:34,683 --> 00:43:37,769
Well, if things get worse
we can go to Osterlich.

504
00:43:37,853 --> 00:43:39,854
That's still a free country.

505
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:42,774
Sooner or later we'll have to go.

506
00:43:42,858 --> 00:43:44,776
- Excuse me.
- Anyway...

507
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,986
it's nice to see you back.

508
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,988
It's like the old days again, eh?

509
00:43:49,073 --> 00:43:51,616
- Yes.
- How's business?

510
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,660
Very slow. Very slow.

511
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,289
Trouble is, the men
are all in concentration camps.

512
00:43:58,374 --> 00:44:01,125
You should go in
for fixing up the women.

513
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,211
Nice money
in the beauty parlor business.

514
00:44:03,295 --> 00:44:06,214
You know anything about it?

515
00:44:09,218 --> 00:44:10,969
Me? No.

516
00:44:11,053 --> 00:44:13,012
Well, you can learn.

517
00:44:13,097 --> 00:44:14,597
You can practice on Hannah.

518
00:44:14,682 --> 00:44:16,349
Yes!

519
00:44:16,433 --> 00:44:19,352
Of course.
Hannah, get up in that chair.

520
00:44:19,436 --> 00:44:21,354
We are going to make you
look beautiful.

521
00:44:21,438 --> 00:44:23,106
Beautiful? What for?

522
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,733
He's going to practice on you
for a beauty parlor.

523
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:30,905
You're not gonna put mud
on my face, are you?

524
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,324
Ah, we are going to take some off.

525
00:44:35,244 --> 00:44:36,953
Make me look beautiful?

526
00:44:37,037 --> 00:44:39,664
Sure. We can't make you
look any worse.

527
00:44:42,084 --> 00:44:45,336
- Hannah!
- Oh, there's Mrs. Shoemaker for the laundry.

528
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:47,463
That's all right.
I'll give it to her.

529
00:44:47,548 --> 00:44:50,299
- You sit here and enjoy yourself.
- What?

530
00:44:50,384 --> 00:44:54,053
I know.
I've seen you making eyes.

531
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:59,434
Don't pay any attention to Mr. Jaeckel.

532
00:45:02,104 --> 00:45:04,689
I like your shop since we fixed it up.

533
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:08,026
I wish I had a business like this.

534
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,486
There's no future in housework.

535
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:13,489
Maybe if I save my money
I can have a barbershop someday.

536
00:45:13,574 --> 00:45:15,867
But I can never save.

537
00:45:15,951 --> 00:45:19,245
Money slips through my fingers
like that.

538
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:22,540
Trouble is, I've always lived up
to every penny I've earned.

539
00:45:22,624 --> 00:45:26,294
Why shouldn't I? You're here today
and gone tomorrow. And then where are you?

540
00:45:28,047 --> 00:45:30,173
- Do you believe in God?
- Well -

541
00:45:30,257 --> 00:45:34,093
I do. But if there wasn't one,
would you live any different?

542
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:38,347
I wouldn't. Life could be wonderful
if people'd leave you alone.

543
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:41,392
Things are looking brighter now.

544
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:45,146
Maybe you're the reason,
saving Commander Schultz's life.

545
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,358
Funny how they've left us alone lately.
Seems too good to be true.

546
00:45:56,325 --> 00:45:58,242
Do you ever daydream?

547
00:45:58,327 --> 00:45:59,660
I do.

548
00:46:00,662 --> 00:46:04,499
That's the only time I'm really happy -
dreaming.

549
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:06,084
Back.

550
00:46:08,378 --> 00:46:12,423
Sometimes I get so carried away I don't know
what I'm doing. Aren't you like that?

551
00:46:14,468 --> 00:46:16,594
- Do you know we're very much alike?
- Are we?

552
00:46:16,678 --> 00:46:18,262
Yeah.
We're both absentminded.

553
00:46:18,347 --> 00:46:19,972
- You think so?
- Yes.

554
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:26,354
I like absentminded people.

555
00:46:31,193 --> 00:46:33,444
Do you know the story about the man
that put his watch in boiling water...

556
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:34,946
and held the egg in his hand?

557
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,781
No!

558
00:46:36,865 --> 00:46:39,325
Very good.

559
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:45,164
They say all great men
are absentminded.

560
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:48,084
It's a sign they're smart.

561
00:46:48,168 --> 00:46:50,169
My folks didn't think so.

562
00:46:53,173 --> 00:46:55,800
Of course there's an excuse for you.
You were injured in the war.

563
00:46:55,884 --> 00:46:58,553
I was born that way.

564
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,437
Wonder why women
never grow whiskers.

565
00:47:08,522 --> 00:47:10,314
Hmm? What?

566
00:47:10,399 --> 00:47:11,899
I s -

567
00:47:14,903 --> 00:47:16,904
What -

568
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:20,783
- Oh, my!
- Isn't that foolish of me!

569
00:47:20,868 --> 00:47:23,536
I could kick myself in the shins, I could.

570
00:47:24,746 --> 00:47:26,914
I'll give you a shampoo.

571
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:28,499
That's good.

572
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:35,923
Voilà.

573
00:47:40,095 --> 00:47:41,762
Gee.

574
00:47:42,806 --> 00:47:44,599
Ain't I cute!

575
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,603
How'd you do it?

576
00:47:50,564 --> 00:47:53,191
You should try it on yourself.

577
00:47:53,275 --> 00:47:55,776
If you were fixed up,
you'd look handsome.

578
00:47:55,861 --> 00:47:57,737
- Yes?
- Yes!

579
00:47:59,781 --> 00:48:01,032
No.

580
00:48:01,116 --> 00:48:03,826
Four pecks a pound! New potatoes!

581
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:07,121
There's the potato man.
I have to go.

582
00:48:10,876 --> 00:48:12,960
Potatoes!

583
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:14,712
One, please!

584
00:48:20,886 --> 00:48:24,013
Take it easy there.

585
00:48:25,307 --> 00:48:27,308
Well, did you hurt yourself?

586
00:48:32,814 --> 00:48:35,066
- Careful next time.
- Here's another one.

587
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:40,863
How do you do?

588
00:48:48,747 --> 00:48:52,416
Something's happened. I know it.
The storm troopers, they helped me up.

589
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,878
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if they stopped hating us...

590
00:48:55,963 --> 00:48:59,590
if they'd leave us alone and let us
go about our business like we used to.

591
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:03,177
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we didn't
have to leave and go to another country?

592
00:49:03,262 --> 00:49:08,307
I don't want to go away. With all the hardship
and the persecution, I love it here.

593
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:10,977
Perhaps we don't have to go.

594
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:14,897
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if they'd let us live and be happy again?

595
00:49:51,977 --> 00:49:53,894
Period.

596
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:00,234
<i>Danke schoen.</i>

597
00:50:23,425 --> 00:50:26,052
Nothing works! Not a decent pen!
Not even a sharp pencil!

598
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:29,638
I'm surrounded by nothing but incompetent,
stupid, sterile stenographers!

599
00:50:29,723 --> 00:50:32,224
- I'll get you a pen.
- Don't bother.

600
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:34,226
I won't send it.

601
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:36,312
Get out! Get out! Get out!

602
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:46,113
We've just discovered the most wonderful,
the most marvelous poison gas!

603
00:50:47,532 --> 00:50:50,034
It will kill everybody!

604
00:50:50,118 --> 00:50:52,370
All right, later, later, later.

605
00:50:52,454 --> 00:50:54,372
<i>B-76 to see Herr Herring.</i>

606
00:50:54,456 --> 00:50:55,873
- Who's that?
- A lady.

607
00:50:55,957 --> 00:50:58,167
My secret agent.

608
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:00,711
Your secret agent.
Tell her to come here.

609
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:02,421
Have B-76 come right in.

610
00:51:03,423 --> 00:51:04,840
Hail Hynkel.

611
00:51:04,925 --> 00:51:07,343
- Oh, Garbitsch, what do you hear from Epstein?
- Most encouraging.

612
00:51:07,427 --> 00:51:11,806
Our agent reports that all the board of directors
are Aryans, so the loan is bound to go through.

613
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,266
- Good.
- Hail Hynkel.

614
00:51:16,978 --> 00:51:18,479
Come here.

615
00:51:21,274 --> 00:51:23,901
- Well?
- The men are planning a strike at the arms factory.

616
00:51:23,985 --> 00:51:26,320
- Who's the leader?
- There were five of them.

617
00:51:26,405 --> 00:51:29,573
- Have them shot.
- They were, Your Excellency.

618
00:51:32,327 --> 00:51:35,830
- How many do you say were going on strike?
- The whole factory - 3,000 of them.

619
00:51:35,914 --> 00:51:39,041
Have them all shot. I don't want
any of my workers dissatisfied.

620
00:51:39,126 --> 00:51:41,293
But, Your Excellency,
these men are skilled craftsmen.

621
00:51:41,378 --> 00:51:44,338
Why not let them work till
they can train others, then shoot them?

622
00:51:44,423 --> 00:51:46,090
We cannot afford to be lenient!

623
00:51:46,174 --> 00:51:48,717
The whole rhythm of production
will be affected if you shoot them now.

624
00:51:48,802 --> 00:51:51,554
"Rhythm of production. "
All right, have your rhythms.

625
00:51:51,638 --> 00:51:55,516
You may instruct your operatives to spare
the strikers and permit them to return to work...

626
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,685
but to mark them
for future reference.

627
00:51:58,687 --> 00:52:00,479
That is my department.
I'll attend to that.

628
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:02,189
This way, madam.

629
00:52:06,945 --> 00:52:10,698
Strange. These strike leaders - they're
all brunettes. Not a blonde amongst them.

630
00:52:10,782 --> 00:52:12,741
Brunettes are troublemakers.
They're worse than the Jews.

631
00:52:12,826 --> 00:52:14,285
Then wipe them out.

632
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:16,662
<i>Doucement.
Not so fast.</i>

633
00:52:16,746 --> 00:52:19,540
We get rid of the Jews first.
Then concentrate on the brunettes.

634
00:52:19,624 --> 00:52:23,085
We shall never have peace
until we have a pure Aryan race.

635
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,462
How wonderful.

636
00:52:24,546 --> 00:52:27,465
Tomainia, a nation
of blue-eyed blondes.

637
00:52:27,549 --> 00:52:30,176
Why not a blonde Europe,
a blonde Asia, a blonde America?

638
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,178
- A blonde world.
- And a brunette dictator.

639
00:52:32,262 --> 00:52:33,471
Dictator of the world.

640
00:52:33,555 --> 00:52:35,181
Why not?

641
00:52:35,265 --> 00:52:37,016
<i>Aut Caesar aut nulles.</i>

642
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,393
The world is effete, worn-out, afraid.

643
00:52:39,478 --> 00:52:41,604
No nation would dare to oppose you.

644
00:52:41,688 --> 00:52:44,148
- Dictator of the world!
- It's your destiny.

645
00:52:44,232 --> 00:52:47,318
We'll kill off the Jews,
wipe out the brunettes.

646
00:52:47,402 --> 00:52:50,488
Then will come forth our dream -
a pure Aryan race.

647
00:52:50,572 --> 00:52:53,616
- Beautiful blonde Aryans.
- They will love you. They will adore you.

648
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,952
- They will worship you as a god!
- No, no! You mustn't say it!

649
00:53:01,249 --> 00:53:03,250
You make me afraid of myself.

650
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,761
Yes, dictator of the world.

651
00:53:13,845 --> 00:53:15,763
We'll start
with the invasion of Osterlich.

652
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:17,765
After that we won't have to fight.
We can bluff.

653
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:19,767
Nation after nation will capitulate.

654
00:53:19,851 --> 00:53:22,686
Within two years
the world will be under your thumb!

655
00:53:22,771 --> 00:53:26,065
Leave me.
I want to be alone.

656
00:53:56,471 --> 00:53:59,890
<i>Aut Caesar aut nulles.</i>

657
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:02,560
Emperor of the world!

658
00:54:05,647 --> 00:54:08,065
My world.

659
00:55:59,594 --> 00:56:02,012
<i>This is the Happy Hour program.</i>

660
00:56:02,097 --> 00:56:05,015
<i>Make your work a pleasure.
Move with the rhythm of music.</i>

661
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,060
<i>Our next selection:
Brahms' "Hungarian Dance No. 5."</i>

662
00:57:57,045 --> 00:57:58,754
Fifteen cents, please.

663
00:58:06,387 --> 00:58:08,639
<i>The Happy Hour program now signing off.</i>

664
00:58:08,723 --> 00:58:11,475
<i>At 6:00 all stations will carry
Adenoid Hynkel's address...</i>

665
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:13,977
<i>to the sons and daughters
of the Double Cross.</i>

666
00:58:14,062 --> 00:58:16,313
Seems like the old days again,
don't it?

667
00:58:16,397 --> 00:58:18,649
I wonder how long
they are going to last.

668
00:58:18,733 --> 00:58:20,317
Don't you read the papers?

669
00:58:20,401 --> 00:58:23,487
It is rumored that Hynkel is going to
give the Jewish people back their rights.

670
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:25,239
Hmm. Maybe.

671
00:58:25,323 --> 00:58:26,824
What do you want?

672
00:58:26,908 --> 00:58:30,577
Business is much better.
Nobody interferes with us anymore.

673
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:32,871
Now don't that make you feel good?

674
00:58:32,956 --> 00:58:34,540
No, sir.

675
00:58:34,624 --> 00:58:39,086
The trouble, Mr. Jaeckel, is, you're so used
to bad times you're unhappy without them.

676
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:42,297
Mary? Mary!
Get my Sunday shoes.

677
00:58:42,382 --> 00:58:45,175
- You'll find them on the window sill.
- All right.

678
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,345
- I can't find the shawl.
- Don't bother. I've got the shawl.

679
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:50,931
- What's going on upstairs?
- It's Hannah.

680
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:53,267
They're dressing her up
to go out this evening.

681
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:56,270
- Is that so?
- She's got a beau.

682
00:58:56,354 --> 00:58:58,480
- Who is it?
- The barber.

683
00:58:59,274 --> 00:59:01,441
Now turn around.

684
00:59:03,152 --> 00:59:05,112
Oh, my dear, those hands.

685
00:59:05,196 --> 00:59:08,782
- What's the matter with them?
- Those calluses - they're so rough.

686
00:59:08,867 --> 00:59:11,660
- Maybe I'd better not go.
- Don't be foolish.

687
00:59:11,744 --> 00:59:13,745
He knows you do housework.

688
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,832
Wait a minute.
I'll get a pair of mittens from Mrs. Morris.

689
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:20,544
- Mrs. Morris?
- Yes, Mrs. Jaeckel? Come in!

690
00:59:20,628 --> 00:59:23,088
Aggie.

691
00:59:23,172 --> 00:59:25,465
- Yeah?
- See if he's ready yet.

692
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,801
All right.

693
00:59:39,981 --> 00:59:43,317
Not yet.
He's polishing a bald man's head.

694
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:51,825
Bad news.

695
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:53,952
The invasion of Osterlich
will have to be delayed.

696
00:59:54,037 --> 00:59:57,289
- What?
- Epstein refuses to lend us the money.

697
00:59:59,417 --> 01:00:01,376
Epstein refuses, huh?

698
01:00:05,715 --> 01:00:07,174
Send for Schultz!

699
01:00:08,259 --> 01:00:09,676
Commander Schultz.

700
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:11,678
Epstein refuses!

701
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:17,476
That contemptible Epstein!
What did he say?

702
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,686
He complained
of the persecution of his people...

703
01:00:19,771 --> 01:00:23,690
and said under no circumstances would he
have any dealings with a medieval maniac.

704
01:00:23,775 --> 01:00:27,110
He'll deal with a medieval maniac
more than he thinks!

705
01:00:30,031 --> 01:00:32,699
First I shall deal with "his people. "

706
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:34,326
Your Excellency?

707
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,536
Schultz, call out the storm troopers.

708
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:39,790
We're going to stage
a little medieval entertainment in the ghetto.

709
01:00:39,874 --> 01:00:42,876
At such a time, Your Excellency,
I think it's ill-advised.

710
01:00:42,961 --> 01:00:44,211
What?

711
01:00:44,295 --> 01:00:46,797
Demonstrations of this kind
are demoralizing the whole country.

712
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:48,548
Indeed.

713
01:00:49,717 --> 01:00:52,636
And since when have you been
so concerned about the ghetto?

714
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,014
I speak in the interests of our party
and for the cause of humanity.

715
01:00:57,892 --> 01:00:59,184
Schultz.

716
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:01,144
You need a vacation.

717
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,730
Fresh air.

718
01:01:06,275 --> 01:01:08,777
A little outdoor exercise.

719
01:01:10,071 --> 01:01:12,698
I shall send you
to a concentration camp.

720
01:01:13,574 --> 01:01:14,908
Guards!

721
01:01:15,702 --> 01:01:17,619
Place Commander Schultz under arrest.

722
01:01:17,704 --> 01:01:19,913
Very well,
but remember my words.

723
01:01:19,998 --> 01:01:24,835
Your cause is doomed to failure because it's built on
the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people.

724
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:26,837
Your policy is worse than a crime.

725
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:29,089
It's a tragic blunder.

726
01:01:29,173 --> 01:01:31,425
Traitor! Traitor!

727
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,095
You're nothing
but a double-dyed democrat!

728
01:01:57,785 --> 01:02:01,288
Schultz, why have you forsaken me?

729
01:02:13,843 --> 01:02:16,928
Excellency, here are the notes
for your speech.

730
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:18,680
Thank you.

731
01:02:29,734 --> 01:02:31,568
I'll not need them.

732
01:02:31,652 --> 01:02:35,530
What I say tonight will not be directed
to the sons and daughters of the Double Cross...

733
01:02:35,615 --> 01:02:39,409
but to the children of Israel.

734
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:13,276
- Ah. Good evening.
- Good evening.

735
01:03:15,363 --> 01:03:16,905
Good night.

736
01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:18,490
Good night.

737
01:03:31,337 --> 01:03:34,714
Do you know, that Hynkel
isn't such a bad fella after all.

738
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,591
Most amusing.

739
01:03:36,676 --> 01:03:38,802
Here you are.
Get a Hynkel button. Get a Hynkel button.

740
01:03:38,886 --> 01:03:41,179
A fine photo of the Phooey
on each and every button.

741
01:03:41,264 --> 01:03:43,515
<i>Two? Here you are, young man.</i>

742
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,684
<i>... the double-crossin'!</i>

743
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:48,228
But the Juden! The Juden!

744
01:04:11,169 --> 01:04:12,919
<i>...und the ghetto...</i>

745
01:04:13,004 --> 01:04:15,172
<i>The ghetto -</i>

746
01:04:29,353 --> 01:04:31,396
- We'd better go home.
- Yeah.

747
01:04:32,273 --> 01:04:33,815
Come on, let's hurry.

748
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,442
Wait a minute. No!

749
01:04:40,364 --> 01:04:45,118
<i>...the Juden. The Juden -</i>

750
01:05:10,061 --> 01:05:13,980
<i>The Juden! The Juden!</i>

01:05:14,065 --> 01:05:16,066
<i>Hey.</i>

752
01:05:26,327 --> 01:05:28,245
What's that?

753
01:05:28,329 --> 01:05:30,330
Turn off the radio!

754
01:05:33,501 --> 01:05:34,459
Listen!

755
01:05:34,543 --> 01:05:36,836
# The Aryan, the Aryan #

756
01:05:36,921 --> 01:05:38,588
It's the storm troopers!

757
01:05:38,673 --> 01:05:40,715
No, no!

758
01:05:45,429 --> 01:05:48,848
<i># The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #</i>

759
01:05:48,933 --> 01:05:50,642

01:05:50,726 --> 01:05:52,769

01:05:55,022 --> 01:05:56,606
- Bar that door!

763
01:05:56,691 --> 01:05:59,609
Mr. Jaeckel.
Mr. Jaeckel, Mr. Jaeckel, Mr. Jaeckel!

764
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:01,945
Oh, my dear!

765
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:03,280
What is it, dear?

766
01:06:03,364 --> 01:06:06,950
Mother, get the women and children up here.
Lock all the doors.

767
01:06:09,954 --> 01:06:12,539
Here. You men, stay right here.

768
01:06:12,623 --> 01:06:14,708
We've got to make a stand.

769
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:18,336
We might as well die
as to go on living like this.

770
01:06:18,421 --> 01:06:20,797
<i># The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #</i>

771
01:06:24,468 --> 01:06:28,138
Wait a minute!
We have a social call to make here!

772
01:06:36,188 --> 01:06:37,689
It's Hynkel!

773
01:06:39,233 --> 01:06:40,734
Wait a minute!

774
01:06:42,945 --> 01:06:44,446
What do you think you're doing?

775
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:47,240
Commander Schultz gave strict orders
not to molest anyone in this court.

776
01:06:47,325 --> 01:06:49,034
These Jews were attacking storm troopers.

777
01:06:49,118 --> 01:06:51,536
I don't care what they were doing.
The orders were to keep out of here.

778
01:06:53,497 --> 01:06:55,832
There! You saw that for yourself!

779
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:58,335
I can't help it.
Those are Commander Schultz's orders.

780
01:06:58,419 --> 01:06:59,919
Come on. Let's get going.

781
01:07:00,004 --> 01:07:01,504
Come on.

785
01:07:23,235 --> 01:07:28,323
Out.

786
01:07:28,407 --> 01:07:29,908
<i>Aww.</i>

787
01:07:41,045 --> 01:07:43,046
Extry! Paper!

788
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:46,132
- Schultz arrested! Paper!
- Did you hear that?

789
01:07:46,217 --> 01:07:48,134
- He's arrested Commander Schultz.
- What?

790
01:07:48,219 --> 01:07:49,886
Commander Schultz
has been arrested!

791
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:52,013
- TTroopers!
- Listen.

792
01:07:52,098 --> 01:07:55,350
- A Jew corrupted our commander!
- Let's kill the lot of them!

793
01:07:56,477 --> 01:07:58,728
Commander Schultz
is under arrest, accused of treason!

794
01:07:58,813 --> 01:08:03,400
And you know why. Schultz was a friend
of the ghetto, a friend of that barber!

795
01:08:03,484 --> 01:08:06,778
- Let's get the barber!
- We want the barber!

796
01:08:06,862 --> 01:08:08,405
We want the barber!

797
01:08:08,489 --> 01:08:10,365
- It's the storm troopers! They're after you!
- We want the barber!

798
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:12,617
- You better get up on the roof.
- No. I'll stay here.

799
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:14,202
Come on! They'll kill you!

800
01:08:14,286 --> 01:08:16,621
- No, I'll stay and fight!
- Don't be a fool!

801
01:08:16,705 --> 01:08:18,998
Do you want to be murdered?
Get on to the roof. Quick!

802
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:21,918
- Come on! Come on!
- Agar, get inside.

803
01:08:22,002 --> 01:08:25,505
We want the barber!
We want the barber!

804
01:08:25,589 --> 01:08:27,173
We want the barber!

805
01:08:27,258 --> 01:08:30,343
All right, here we are!
Smash in the door! Come on!

806
01:08:32,263 --> 01:08:33,596
Come on, boys!

807
01:08:33,681 --> 01:08:36,224
Come on, boys!
We'll give the barber a haircut!

808
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:44,149
- All right, where are the bombs?
- Come on. This way!

809
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:45,859
Let 'er go!

810
01:08:47,987 --> 01:08:53,158
# Aryan, the Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #

811
01:09:02,334 --> 01:09:04,210
There goes the barbershop.

812
01:09:07,131 --> 01:09:09,299
Never mind. We can start again.

813
01:09:09,383 --> 01:09:12,635
We can go to Osterlich.
That's still a free country.

814
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,054
Mr. Jaeckel says it's beautiful there.

815
01:09:15,139 --> 01:09:18,224
Wonderful green fields,
and they grow apples and grapes.

816
01:09:19,018 --> 01:09:21,561
Mr. Jaeckel's brother's got a vineyard
in Osterlich.

817
01:09:21,645 --> 01:09:25,106
And when Mr. Jaeckel goes there,
he said he'd take me with him.

818
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:27,108
Now we can all go together.

819
01:09:27,943 --> 01:09:30,904
It'll be wonderful living in the country.

820
01:09:30,988 --> 01:09:33,948
Much better than a smoky old city.

821
01:09:34,658 --> 01:09:38,077
And if we work hard and don't eat much,
we can save money.

822
01:09:38,996 --> 01:09:41,247
We can buy a chicken farm.

823
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,584
There's nice money
to be made in chickens.

824
01:10:07,483 --> 01:10:09,275
Look at that star.

825
01:10:11,195 --> 01:10:13,154
Isn't it beautiful?

826
01:10:16,617 --> 01:10:20,286
One thing - Hynkel with all his power
can never touch that.

827
01:10:22,957 --> 01:10:25,959
It's all right now.
The coast is clear. Listen.

828
01:10:26,043 --> 01:10:28,336
Commander Schultz escaped.
He's hiding in my cellar.

829
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,379
What?

830
01:10:29,463 --> 01:10:33,049
He's holding a meeting at midnight
and he wants you to be there.

831
01:10:33,133 --> 01:10:34,884
Hannah, you too come down...

832
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:36,719
and help Mrs. Jaeckel with the supper.

833
01:10:36,804 --> 01:10:38,304
All right. I'll be down.

834
01:10:42,977 --> 01:10:44,811
I don't understand it.

835
01:10:44,895 --> 01:10:47,480
This crazy midnight supper.

836
01:10:47,565 --> 01:10:50,400
What does this Commander Schultz
want of us?

837
01:10:50,484 --> 01:10:52,569
He wants us to blow up the palace.

838
01:10:52,653 --> 01:10:54,320
What?

839
01:10:54,405 --> 01:10:57,824
We Jewish people shouldn't
get mixed up in such a business.

840
01:10:57,908 --> 01:11:01,536
I know it, but Commander Schultz is such
a good talker, he has them all hypnotized.

841
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,788
I knew he was up to some mischief.

842
01:11:03,872 --> 01:11:05,498
Sure, he is!

843
01:11:06,584 --> 01:11:08,209
I came in the kitchen this evening...

844
01:11:08,294 --> 01:11:11,004
and found him putting a coin
in one of your puddings.

845
01:11:11,088 --> 01:11:13,548
Putting a coin in one of the puddings?

846
01:11:13,632 --> 01:11:17,302
But don't worry. I've fixed everything.
Wait and see.

847
01:11:17,386 --> 01:11:22,098
Gentlemen, may I claim
your indulgence for a moment?

848
01:11:22,182 --> 01:11:26,603
We are here tonight
to rid the country of a tyrant.

849
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:30,231
In order to carry out this plan,
one of us must die.

850
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:36,696
In ancient times,
the Aryan tribe of Langobardians...

851
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,657
made human sacrifice to the god Thor.

852
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:43,953
At a feast by lottery
the victim was chosen.

853
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:47,624
Tonight at this feast
one of you will be chosen.

854
01:11:51,629 --> 01:11:53,713
Each man will receive a pudding.

855
01:11:53,797 --> 01:11:56,257
Concealed in one of these is a coin.

856
01:11:56,342 --> 01:11:59,594
Whoever gets that coin must give up his life
for the liberation of his people.

857
01:11:59,678 --> 01:12:04,390
But he will join the long line
of history's noble martyrs...

858
01:12:04,475 --> 01:12:08,227
and will rid his country of a tyrant.

859
01:12:11,398 --> 01:12:12,398
Ooh!

860
01:12:19,281 --> 01:12:21,908
I know that it is the wish
of all of us...

861
01:12:21,992 --> 01:12:24,827
to be chosen this night
to die for Tomainia.

862
01:12:25,663 --> 01:12:28,581
Much as I should like
to participate in this ordeal...

863
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:30,166
I cannot.

864
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,751
Why?

865
01:12:34,797 --> 01:12:37,674
Don't you understand?
He's too well-known.

866
01:12:37,758 --> 01:12:40,426
It must be done by somebody like us.

867
01:12:40,511 --> 01:12:42,261
I can't see it like that.

868
01:12:42,346 --> 01:12:46,182
Gentlemen, if this is a question of my honor,
it's very embarrassing.

869
01:12:47,851 --> 01:12:51,145
Commander Schultz,
I apologize for my friend.

870
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:54,607
And let me say on behalf
of myself and the others...

871
01:12:54,692 --> 01:12:58,528
that we consider it a great privilege
to die for our country.

872
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:04,742
Very well then. Gentlemen, I shall now retire
until fate has chosen the liberator.

873
01:13:08,205 --> 01:13:10,623
Until then, hail Hynk -

874
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:13,042
Oh, what am I saying?

875
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:17,964
Gentlemen, we have pledged our honor.

876
01:13:18,048 --> 01:13:19,257
Proceed.

877
01:16:25,569 --> 01:16:28,237
Gentlemen, the coin is here.

878
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:36,412
What's the meaning of all this?

879
01:16:36,496 --> 01:16:37,997
Somebody made a fool of us.

880
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:40,166
- You're quite right. I did.
- What?

881
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:42,293
I put a coin in every pudding.

882
01:16:45,422 --> 01:16:47,256
Mr. Jaeckel!

883
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:52,303
Blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people.
We're in enough trouble as it is.

884
01:16:53,597 --> 01:16:57,099
Hannah's right.
We've all been foolish.

885
01:16:57,184 --> 01:17:00,686
Our place is at home,
looking after our own affairs.

886
01:17:00,771 --> 01:17:02,647
Good night.

887
01:17:02,731 --> 01:17:04,231
What's this?

888
01:17:04,316 --> 01:17:05,816
Good night.

889
01:17:10,447 --> 01:17:12,448
Good morning.

890
01:17:24,127 --> 01:17:27,046
By the papers they are saying Commander
Schultz may be hiding in the ghetto.

891
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:29,465
Here it is. Read it for yourself.

892
01:17:30,634 --> 01:17:32,635
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

893
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,845
Hannah, here. Read that.

894
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:36,722
"Mystery still surrounds
the disappearance...

895
01:17:36,807 --> 01:17:38,057
of ex-Commander Schultz.

896
01:17:38,141 --> 01:17:41,686
At police headquarters it was believed that
the commander may be hiding in the ghetto.

897
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:45,690
A certain Jewish barber,
reported to be a friend of Schultz...

898
01:17:45,774 --> 01:17:47,650
is also wanted for questioning. "

899
01:17:47,734 --> 01:17:48,734
Me?

900
01:17:48,819 --> 01:17:51,320
Well, if it's just for questioning,
it can't be serious.

901
01:17:51,405 --> 01:17:55,491
Meyerberg was only wanted for questioning,
and we never heard of him since.

902
01:17:55,575 --> 01:17:57,410
Shh!

903
01:18:06,169 --> 01:18:08,254
- Who is it?
- It's me - Mr. Mann.

904
01:18:11,758 --> 01:18:14,218
Hello, Jaeckel. How are you, Mr. Agar?

905
01:18:14,302 --> 01:18:16,595
- How are you, Mrs. Jaeckel?
- How do you do?

906
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,514
Did you hear
what they're saying in the papers...

907
01:18:18,598 --> 01:18:20,266
about Commander Schultz
hiding in the ghetto?

908
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:21,851
Oh, I know, I know.

909
01:18:21,935 --> 01:18:25,521
Well, don't you think that it's serious for you
if they find him here in the house?

910
01:18:25,605 --> 01:18:27,231
Shh!

911
01:18:27,315 --> 01:18:29,984
Don't you realize
there are spies everywhere?

912
01:18:30,068 --> 01:18:32,153
Spies?

913
01:18:33,864 --> 01:18:37,491
What's the matter with him?

914
01:18:37,576 --> 01:18:40,161
Didn't you read
he's wanted for questioning?

915
01:18:40,245 --> 01:18:42,079
Oy.

916
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:43,497
Where's the commander?

917
01:18:43,582 --> 01:18:45,875
He's in the next room.

918
01:18:45,959 --> 01:18:47,460
Let me tell you.

919
01:18:47,544 --> 01:18:49,420
If Commander Schultz is found
in this house...

920
01:18:49,504 --> 01:18:54,091
we'll all go to the concentration camp for life
and get our heads cut off in the bargain.

921
01:18:54,176 --> 01:18:56,093
Am I giving you an argument?

922
01:18:56,178 --> 01:18:57,720
Then get rid of him.

923
01:18:57,804 --> 01:18:59,513
You can't throw him out.

924
01:18:59,598 --> 01:19:01,140
Of course not.

925
01:19:01,224 --> 01:19:04,977
But I should like to know,
how long is he going to stay here?

926
01:19:05,062 --> 01:19:06,145
That's all.

927
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:08,647
Come. Your breakfast is on the table.

928
01:19:08,732 --> 01:19:11,484
- Mr. Mann?
- Thank you.

929
01:19:11,568 --> 01:19:13,402
I have breakfast waiting at home.

930
01:19:14,988 --> 01:19:17,281
Take the other side of the street
and search every house.

931
01:19:20,327 --> 01:19:21,869
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

932
01:19:21,953 --> 01:19:24,163
- What's wrong now?
- They're looking for Commander Schultz.

933
01:19:24,247 --> 01:19:27,166
- Commander Schultz?
- He's supposed to be hiding in one of those houses.

934
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,585
Oh, they're always looking
for somebody.

935
01:19:42,682 --> 01:19:45,101
- Who is it?
- It's me. Let me in!

936
01:19:45,185 --> 01:19:47,561
- For heaven's sake, hurry up!
- Open the door.

937
01:19:52,109 --> 01:19:53,609
- They're coming this way.
- What?

938
01:19:53,693 --> 01:19:56,195
The storm troopers are searching
every house.

939
01:19:56,279 --> 01:19:57,863
Quick! Tell the commander.

940
01:20:05,038 --> 01:20:06,539
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

941
01:20:06,623 --> 01:20:09,041
- What is it?
- The storm troopers, they're going to search the house.

942
01:20:09,126 --> 01:20:12,044
- What?
- You'd better get up on the roof. Quick! Both of you!

943
01:20:13,505 --> 01:20:14,797
Wait a minute!

944
01:20:14,881 --> 01:20:18,217
- We can't leave all these things about.
- That's right. All of you, pack my valises.

945
01:20:20,137 --> 01:20:21,846
You pack this valise.

946
01:20:30,564 --> 01:20:32,731
- Clear this shelf. Quickly.
- Oh, yes.

947
01:20:35,318 --> 01:20:37,403
Pack this and this.

948
01:20:37,487 --> 01:20:40,406
Oh, this mustn't be found here.
Open the door.

949
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:49,665
Listen! They are here!
Get up on the roof. Quick!

950
01:20:49,749 --> 01:20:52,501
- I'll take this.
- Be sure they don't leave anything behind.

951
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:54,587
- My golf clubs.
- The hatbox!

952
01:20:57,757 --> 01:21:00,009
- Here. Take this.
- Come on! Let's hurry!

953
01:21:00,093 --> 01:21:01,677
- Where are you going?
- I'm going with him.

954
01:21:01,761 --> 01:21:03,554
You stay here. You'll see him later.
Here. Take this.

955
01:21:03,638 --> 01:21:05,514
- I'll meet you on the roof tonight.
- All right.

956
01:21:05,599 --> 01:21:07,099
Oh, take this.

957
01:21:11,354 --> 01:21:13,272
Come on. Quick! Come on.

958
01:21:13,356 --> 01:21:16,358
Open in the name of Hynkel!

959
01:21:23,074 --> 01:21:25,075
Stop!

960
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,286
- Look where you are.
- Look where?

961
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:28,996
Look where you are.

962
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,207
Wait, I can't - I can't see.
Wait a moment.

963
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:35,878
- My bag! You've dropped it!
- No, it's right here. Here it is.

964
01:21:42,844 --> 01:21:45,554
Don't drop the other one!
Don't drop the other one!

965
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:48,974
My golf clubs! Not my golf clubs!

966
01:21:49,643 --> 01:21:51,602
Come off of there. They'll see you.

967
01:21:52,979 --> 01:21:55,314
Quick! This way!

968
01:22:00,695 --> 01:22:02,821
Whoa! Steady!

969
01:22:02,906 --> 01:22:04,865
Now be careful.

970
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:06,283
Yes, sir.

971
01:22:06,368 --> 01:22:08,410
You were lucky
you didn't break your neck.

972
01:22:08,495 --> 01:22:09,828
Yes, sir.

973
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:15,668
You'll pardon me.

974
01:22:18,755 --> 01:22:19,838
Sorry.

975
01:22:22,175 --> 01:22:24,802
You guard the back -
Wait a minute.

976
01:22:24,886 --> 01:22:26,845
I'm sorry.
I shall have to bother you again.

977
01:22:28,098 --> 01:22:29,598
There he is!

978
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,813
Well, good morning. How are you?

979
01:22:35,897 --> 01:22:37,690
Oh, so-so.

980
01:22:37,774 --> 01:22:39,566
Commander Schultz, who's your friend?

981
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:41,944
Remember, your silence
will be appreciated.

982
01:22:42,028 --> 01:22:43,696
- Yes, sir.
- Take him down to the wagon.

983
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:44,947
Come on.

984
01:22:57,794 --> 01:23:00,129
- Hey! Where you going?
- To the smoking room.

985
01:23:00,213 --> 01:23:02,381
Ah, come on! Down this way!

986
01:23:51,848 --> 01:23:53,349
Osterlich.

987
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:54,433
<i>Ja.</i>

988
01:25:27,527 --> 01:25:29,194
Gentlemen, I am pleased to announce...

989
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:32,781
that we are at last
ready to march on Osterlich.

990
01:25:32,866 --> 01:25:35,617
This was made possible
by the enterprise and genius...

991
01:25:35,702 --> 01:25:37,703
of Field Marshal Herring...

992
01:25:37,787 --> 01:25:40,622
upon whom I shall now pin
a token of my regard.

993
01:25:45,628 --> 01:25:50,549
<i>...der Wiener schnitzel -</i>

994
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,058
...da genius.

995
01:26:05,398 --> 01:26:08,400
Turn around. No. Ah, yes.

996
01:26:21,164 --> 01:26:22,664
Gentlemen...

997
01:26:24,334 --> 01:26:26,919
to Field Marshal Herring.

998
01:26:27,003 --> 01:26:28,921
To the invasion of Osterlich.

999
01:26:45,688 --> 01:26:46,688
Elephant.

1000
01:26:48,942 --> 01:26:52,194
Hello? Yes. Yes.

1001
01:26:52,278 --> 01:26:53,278
Wait.

1002
01:26:53,363 --> 01:26:55,614
Napaloni's mobilized his army
on the Osterlich front.

1003
01:26:55,698 --> 01:26:57,115
What?

1004
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,618
Already 60,000 men are on the border.

1005
01:26:59,702 --> 01:27:01,203
He's going to take Osterlich!

1006
01:27:01,287 --> 01:27:03,080
I can't believe it.

1007
01:27:05,124 --> 01:27:07,751
You can't believe it?

1008
01:27:07,835 --> 01:27:10,462
But, Your Excellency, I -

1009
01:27:10,547 --> 01:27:12,506
- You let him steal a march on us!
- No, I -

1010
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:15,092
You can't believe it?

1011
01:27:15,176 --> 01:27:19,638
I did everything that was -

1012
01:27:19,722 --> 01:27:23,475
I had the ground covered.

1013
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:33,318
Haven't you any brains?

1014
01:27:33,403 --> 01:27:35,320
<i>..."pinheaden"...</i>

1015
01:27:45,582 --> 01:27:47,249
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1016
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:49,501
No, no, no, no, no!

1017
01:27:50,587 --> 01:27:52,921
No, no - No!

1018
01:27:53,006 --> 01:27:55,340
- Declare war on Napaloni!
- Napaloni?

1019
01:27:55,425 --> 01:27:59,761
Yes, Napaloni! Listen, you blockhead! Mobilize
every division of the army and the air force.

1020
01:27:59,846 --> 01:28:02,764
- Proceed to Bacteria and attack at once!
- But war will be the end of us.

1021
01:28:02,849 --> 01:28:04,016
- Do as I tell you.
- Madness.

1022
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:05,851
- Shut up!
- Very well. Will you sign this?

1023
01:28:05,935 --> 01:28:08,186
- Yes, I'll - What is it?
- A declaration of war.

1024
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:09,938
I'll sign it. A pen.

1025
01:28:10,023 --> 01:28:12,441
I'll sign it.

1026
01:28:18,364 --> 01:28:19,615
A pen!

1027
01:28:19,699 --> 01:28:21,867
I'll sign it! Napaloni.

1028
01:28:21,951 --> 01:28:24,703
<i>Der grosser peanut!
Der cheesy ravioli!</i>

1029
01:28:24,787 --> 01:28:26,330
There!

1030
01:28:26,414 --> 01:28:28,081
Hello?

1031
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,208
- It's Napaloni.
- Wait a minute.

1032
01:28:30,293 --> 01:28:32,210
Napaloni?

1033
01:28:32,295 --> 01:28:34,963
- You talk to him.
- What shall I say?

1034
01:28:35,048 --> 01:28:37,633
Be nice, affable, pleasant.

1035
01:28:40,762 --> 01:28:41,803
Hello?

1036
01:28:41,888 --> 01:28:44,306
Well, well, well. How are you?

1037
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:46,183
Fine.

1038
01:28:46,267 --> 01:28:49,061
No, he hasn't been playing
very much lately.

1039
01:28:49,145 --> 01:28:51,480
You went around in '92? Really?

1040
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:55,525
You want to speak to His Excellency?

1041
01:29:00,406 --> 01:29:02,491
Just now he's a little hoarse.

1042
01:29:02,575 --> 01:29:06,870
Hmm. No, no. I mean he can't talk.

1043
01:29:06,954 --> 01:29:09,122
May I take a message?

1044
01:29:09,874 --> 01:29:13,085
He says no doubt you've heard of the movement
of his troops on the Osterlich front...

1045
01:29:13,169 --> 01:29:14,670
and he'd like to discuss
the matter with you.

1046
01:29:14,754 --> 01:29:16,463
Ask him to come here.

1047
01:29:16,547 --> 01:29:18,840
His Excellency would be delighted
to invite you to Tomainia...

1048
01:29:18,925 --> 01:29:20,717
where you could discuss the matter.

1049
01:29:21,844 --> 01:29:24,513
Very well.
I'll make the necessary arrangements.

1050
01:29:24,597 --> 01:29:26,515
Good-bye, Your Excellency.

1051
01:29:26,599 --> 01:29:27,849
He's coming.

1052
01:29:27,934 --> 01:29:30,352
Good. We'll give him the works.

1053
01:29:30,436 --> 01:29:32,771
We'll put on the greatest military show
the world has ever known!

1054
01:29:32,855 --> 01:29:37,067
Convinced of my strength, Napaloni will
leave the invasion of Osterlich to me.

1055
01:29:38,528 --> 01:29:40,028
What shall I do with this?

1056
01:29:40,113 --> 01:29:42,322
- What is it?
- Your declaration of war.

1057
01:29:45,493 --> 01:29:47,619
Peace is declared.

1058
01:29:50,039 --> 01:29:54,459
<i>2,975,000 eager citizens
are massed in the station square...</i>

1059
01:29:54,544 --> 01:29:57,129
<i>awaiting the arrival
of Benzine Napaloni.</i>

1060
01:29:57,213 --> 01:30:01,299
<i>Entering the station is our beloved Phooey,
ready to greet his distinguished guest.</i>

1061
01:30:01,384 --> 01:30:03,468
<i>This historic meeting
will cement a friendship...</i>

1062
01:30:03,553 --> 01:30:07,556
<i>that has long existed between our Phooey
and the dictator of Bacteria.</i>

1063
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:08,974
Order... arms!

1064
01:30:09,058 --> 01:30:12,477
<i>His Excellency is about to greet
the Bacterian ambassador.</i>

1065
01:30:12,562 --> 01:30:14,646
- How do you do?
- Thank you, sir.

1066
01:30:15,815 --> 01:30:17,065
Garbitsch.

1067
01:30:18,901 --> 01:30:20,652
See about the photography.

1068
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:23,905
When Their Excellencies meet...

1069
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:26,283
tell the press to see that our Phooey
is well-photographed.

1070
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:28,160
- Full face, not the back of his head.
- Yes, sir.

1071
01:30:28,244 --> 01:30:31,496
<i>Benzino Napaloni's private train
is now coming into the station.</i>

1072
01:30:31,581 --> 01:30:33,665
<i>And from a pink and white car...</i>

1073
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:36,585
<i>- Napaloni and his wife will step onto a crimson carpet...
- Present arms!</i>

1074
01:30:36,669 --> 01:30:39,254
<i>where Adenoid Hynkel will deliver
his address of welcome.</i>

1075
01:30:51,017 --> 01:30:52,684
What's the matter with this stupid -

1076
01:30:53,936 --> 01:30:55,604
Hey! What's all of this-a mix-up-a?

1077
01:30:55,688 --> 01:30:57,522
Come on. They've gone too far.

1078
01:30:59,025 --> 01:31:01,943
At ease! Bring along the carpet.

1079
01:31:02,028 --> 01:31:04,196
Papa, why can't we get out here?

1080
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,948
- There is no carpet.
- Who cares about a carpet?

1081
01:31:07,033 --> 01:31:10,535
Il Dig-a-Ditchy, me - Napaloni.
I never get out without a carpet.

1082
01:31:16,209 --> 01:31:18,752
Come on.
Lay it down here. Quick.

1083
01:31:18,836 --> 01:31:20,295
- Hurry up!
- It's going back again!

1084
01:31:20,379 --> 01:31:21,505
What?

1085
01:31:24,801 --> 01:31:27,928
What do you do? You salami?

1086
01:31:30,139 --> 01:31:32,557
Let's get out!
Let's get out while it's stopping!

1087
01:31:32,642 --> 01:31:34,059
Shut up!

1088
01:31:37,772 --> 01:31:39,940
Hurry. Quick. Put it down.

1089
01:31:41,234 --> 01:31:43,109
Take it away. Take it away.

1090
01:31:43,194 --> 01:31:46,655
Stay here. Stay here
until they've made up their mind.

1091
01:31:51,953 --> 01:31:54,746
You got-a the carpet?
Well, put 'em-a down!

1092
01:31:55,581 --> 01:31:57,666
Hmm. Oh, come on, come on.

1093
01:32:01,087 --> 01:32:03,004
Here he is.

1094
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:05,924
- My friend!
- Napaloni!

1095
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:11,346
- This is indeed a pleasure.
- Thank you.

1096
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:14,641
Welcome to Tomainia. This way.

1097
01:32:14,725 --> 01:32:16,101
Pictures, Your Excellencies?

1098
01:32:16,185 --> 01:32:18,520
Oh, sure. Salute!

1099
01:32:18,604 --> 01:32:20,105
Another one, please.

1100
01:32:20,189 --> 01:32:22,607
Ah, this is really a pleasure
to be here, my friend Hynkel.

1101
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:25,443
Oh, you want another picture?
Just a moment.

1102
01:32:25,528 --> 01:32:26,528
There.

1103
01:32:31,534 --> 01:32:33,785
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- My bambino!

1104
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:35,829
- All right. It's all right-a, Mama.
- Get rid of those men.

1105
01:32:35,913 --> 01:32:37,038
- Where is my ambassador?
- Dismissed.

1106
01:32:37,123 --> 01:32:38,874
- There you are. Hello, Spook.
- Your Excellency.

1107
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:41,710
How do you feel?
Good! Look after Mama.

1108
01:32:41,794 --> 01:32:43,545
Oh, Hynkie, did you meet-a my wife?

1109
01:32:43,629 --> 01:32:44,754
- Your wife?
- That's her.

1110
01:32:44,839 --> 01:32:45,839
- I -
- Let's go.

1111
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:50,218
Tomainia! Very nice. Very nice.

1112
01:32:51,971 --> 01:32:54,347
Present... arms!

1113
01:32:54,432 --> 01:32:58,226
Napaloni! Napaloni!

1114
01:33:09,906 --> 01:33:11,698
Clock is a-two minutes-a slow.

1115
01:33:12,408 --> 01:33:13,825
This way.

1116
01:33:27,423 --> 01:33:31,092
Napaloni! Napaloni!

1117
01:33:31,177 --> 01:33:32,677
Napaloni!

1118
01:33:37,683 --> 01:33:39,935
It's-a very nice-a people.

1119
01:33:40,019 --> 01:33:43,772
- I say, the people are very nice.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

1120
01:33:45,691 --> 01:33:47,192
- He is my husband!
- Keep back!

1121
01:33:47,276 --> 01:33:48,443
- You make a mistake!
- Let me go!

1122
01:33:48,527 --> 01:33:50,195
- You make a big-a mistake-a!
- Get back!

1123
01:33:50,279 --> 01:33:51,488
Please!

1124
01:33:53,491 --> 01:33:55,700
At all costs, Napaloni shall not
invade Osterlich.

1125
01:33:55,785 --> 01:33:57,369
That country belongs to me.

1126
01:33:57,453 --> 01:34:00,580
At this meeting we shall not
discuss the Osterlich situation.

1127
01:34:00,665 --> 01:34:04,042
This interview is solely to impress upon him
the force of your personality.

1128
01:34:04,126 --> 01:34:07,295
- Hmm.
- To make him feel your superiority.

1129
01:34:08,756 --> 01:34:10,924
This man Napaloni
is aggressive, domineering.

1130
01:34:11,008 --> 01:34:13,301
Before we make our demands,
we must put him in his place.

1131
01:34:13,386 --> 01:34:16,304
- Precisely. But how?
- By means of applied psychology.

1132
01:34:16,389 --> 01:34:19,224
In other words,
by making him feel inferior.

1133
01:34:19,308 --> 01:34:21,309
This can be done in many subtle ways.

1134
01:34:21,394 --> 01:34:24,479
For instance, at this interview,
I have so arranged...

1135
01:34:24,563 --> 01:34:26,940
that he will always be
looking up at you...

1136
01:34:27,024 --> 01:34:28,650
you looking down at him.

1137
01:34:28,734 --> 01:34:31,277
At all times his position
will be inferior.

1138
01:34:31,362 --> 01:34:33,154
Mmm. Excellent.

1139
01:34:33,239 --> 01:34:37,409
Then again, we shall seat him here
beside your bust...

1140
01:34:37,493 --> 01:34:40,912
so that if you relax,
that will always be glaring at him.

1141
01:34:40,997 --> 01:34:43,331
And?

1142
01:34:43,416 --> 01:34:44,874
Where is he now?

1143
01:34:44,959 --> 01:34:47,794
Resting.
When he arrives, I have arranged...

1144
01:34:47,878 --> 01:34:50,755
that he shall enter
from the far end of the room.

1145
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,091
Another psychological triumph.

1146
01:34:53,175 --> 01:34:56,594
He will have the embarrassment of walking
the entire length of the floor toward you.

1147
01:34:56,679 --> 01:34:59,055
Very good.

1148
01:35:01,392 --> 01:35:02,684
Yes?

1149
01:35:02,768 --> 01:35:05,520
<i>His Excellency
Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room.</i>

1150
01:35:05,604 --> 01:35:09,107
He's coming! He's coming!
Quick, get me a flower. A flower.

1151
01:35:09,191 --> 01:35:11,443
Remember, at all times you must be
above him, before him.

1152
01:35:11,527 --> 01:35:13,445
Entering or leaving,
you must be first.

1153
01:35:19,869 --> 01:35:22,037
Hello, Hynkie!

1154
01:35:22,121 --> 01:35:25,957
<i>Wie Gootz! Wie geht's!</i>

1155
01:35:26,042 --> 01:35:28,001
How-a you feel?

1156
01:35:31,464 --> 01:35:34,382
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Ah, my brother dictator!

1157
01:35:35,176 --> 01:35:37,135
You are a nice little man, a-Hynkie!

1158
01:35:37,219 --> 01:35:40,805
I'm so glad to see you again.

1159
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:43,475
And my friend the Garbitsch!
Hello!

1160
01:35:44,643 --> 01:35:47,062
Ah, this is a lovely place.

1161
01:35:47,146 --> 01:35:50,148
I feel-a fine.
I just had a nice-a cold shower.

1162
01:35:50,232 --> 01:35:54,194
And that bathtub - as soon as you get
the plumbing fixed, it'll be in-a good-a shape.

1163
01:35:55,571 --> 01:35:57,405
Your Excellency, won't you sit down.

1164
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:58,990
Oh, shoot, shoot.

1165
01:36:20,471 --> 01:36:23,640
Well-a, Hynkie, my dictator friend, you -

1166
01:36:28,771 --> 01:36:30,355
I must be-a growing.

1167
01:36:32,024 --> 01:36:34,192
Not sure why they gave me
a baby stool.

1168
01:36:42,868 --> 01:36:46,204
This-a stool is not for me.
I like it-a better up-a-stairs here.

1169
01:36:46,288 --> 01:36:48,414
You know-a something, Garbitsch?
This is a lovely country.

1170
01:36:48,499 --> 01:36:49,958
Very nice-a people.

1171
01:36:50,042 --> 01:36:52,460
I thought the public extremely enthusiastic
on your arrival.

1172
01:36:52,545 --> 01:36:54,879
Sure. They like to see new faces.

1173
01:36:58,384 --> 01:37:02,095
I'm sorry for the mishap that occurred
to Madam Napaloni at the railroad station.

1174
01:37:02,179 --> 01:37:04,013
What's that? What's that?

1175
01:37:04,098 --> 01:37:08,059
I'm sorry for the Napaloni
that occurred at the - at the rail -

1176
01:37:08,894 --> 01:37:11,146
Madam Napaloni at the railway station.

1177
01:37:11,897 --> 01:37:15,316
Oh, she's not used to public life.
She can't take it.

1178
01:37:15,401 --> 01:37:16,484
Match.

1179
01:37:16,569 --> 01:37:18,319
Oh - I'm sorry. I'm -

1180
01:37:18,404 --> 01:37:21,906
No, that's all right.
Don't apologize. I find-a one.

1181
01:37:23,659 --> 01:37:26,911
I am simply crazy about this a-palace.

1182
01:37:26,996 --> 01:37:29,914
Ivory and gold -
that makes a lovely combination.

1183
01:37:29,999 --> 01:37:33,418
Gets away from that gingerbread idea.
Say, tell me something-a, Garbitsch.

1184
01:37:34,503 --> 01:37:36,004
What's on the program?

1185
01:37:36,088 --> 01:37:38,339
- There's the grand ball this evening.
- Grand ball?

1186
01:37:38,424 --> 01:37:41,509
The grand ball. And this afternoon,
a review of the army.

1187
01:37:41,594 --> 01:37:43,553
Review of the army?
Well, that won't take-a long.

1188
01:37:43,637 --> 01:37:47,098
- I'm afraid it will.
- Oh? So you got a big army, huh?

1189
01:37:47,183 --> 01:37:49,517
Modesty forbids.

1190
01:37:50,436 --> 01:37:52,187
Yes, seems I've heard
something about it.

1191
01:37:52,271 --> 01:37:54,606
If I'm gonna review the army,
I think I'll get me a shave.

1192
01:37:54,690 --> 01:37:57,192
- We have a barbershop in the palace.
- Is that so?

1193
01:37:58,110 --> 01:38:00,486
Hynkie, you look a little blue
under the gills.

1194
01:38:00,571 --> 01:38:03,448
- What do you say we take a shave together?
- I should be delighted.

1195
01:38:03,532 --> 01:38:05,491
- Good!
- Very well. This way.

1196
01:38:15,377 --> 01:38:17,879
Ah, this is the barbershop.
I can-a smell 'em.

1197
01:38:25,638 --> 01:38:27,555
Ah, now this is-a sweet -
a- very sweet.

1198
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:30,308
- Do you like it? It was the emperor's library.
- Makes a good a-barbershop.

1199
01:38:30,392 --> 01:38:32,644
- Too old fashioned. I want something modern.
- Is that so?

1200
01:38:32,728 --> 01:38:35,813
You see, when I get shaved, I'm very nervous.
I like something to look at.

1201
01:38:35,898 --> 01:38:37,899
So I'm putting in glass walls and ceiling...

1202
01:38:37,983 --> 01:38:40,818
so that when my head is turned this way,
I shall have a view of the mountains.

1203
01:38:41,695 --> 01:38:44,322
And when it's tipped this way,
I shall have a view through the glass ceiling.

1204
01:38:44,406 --> 01:38:46,199
- What's above-a the ceiling?
- The ballroom.

1205
01:38:48,410 --> 01:38:50,912
Then in my summer palace
I have a barbershop.

1206
01:38:52,748 --> 01:38:55,041
Is that so?

1207
01:38:55,125 --> 01:38:56,542
Yes.

1208
01:38:56,627 --> 01:38:58,670
That also has glass walls.

1209
01:38:58,754 --> 01:39:00,255
You don't tell me.

1210
01:39:00,339 --> 01:39:03,591
Oh, yes.
With goldfish swimming inside.

1211
01:39:03,676 --> 01:39:05,593
Wait a minute.
Goldfish swimming inside-a the walls?

1212
01:39:05,678 --> 01:39:07,345
- Mm-hmm.
- How do you feed 'em?

1213
01:39:07,429 --> 01:39:10,932
You can't. They're all dead.
That's why I'm building a new barbershop.

1214
01:39:13,852 --> 01:39:16,437
- Very interesting. Very interesting.
- Yes? Do you like it?

1215
01:39:21,443 --> 01:39:23,027
<i>This is the Hynkel Stadium.</i>

1216
01:39:23,112 --> 01:39:26,948
<i>Before a half million spectators, the greatest
display of arms the world has ever known...</i>

1217
01:39:27,032 --> 01:39:29,033
<i>marches by in review.</i>

1218
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:31,119
<i>Our beloved Phooey
and Il Dig-a-Ditchy are seated...</i>

1219
01:39:31,203 --> 01:39:34,414
<i>in the reviewing stand,
thrilled by this historic event.</i>

1220
01:39:35,416 --> 01:39:36,416
What?

1221
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,126
Nothing. I'm just chewing.

1222
01:39:39,962 --> 01:39:41,879
- Ah, yes.
- Would you care for some peanuts?

1223
01:39:42,965 --> 01:39:46,301
- Thank you. I've had some.
- Oh. Good shape. Here you are, Spook.

1224
01:39:46,385 --> 01:39:48,636
<i>Now passing -
Tomainia's heavy artillery.</i>

1225
01:39:50,472 --> 01:39:51,973
It's all right.

1226
01:39:52,057 --> 01:39:55,852
I want to show you my new bombing planes.
I just called up a half hour ago to start 'em over.

1227
01:39:55,936 --> 01:39:57,562
- Where are they coming from?
- Aroma.

1228
01:39:57,646 --> 01:39:59,314
Aroma? That's 400 miles away.

1229
01:39:59,398 --> 01:40:02,025
That's right. They should be here now.
I don't know what's detaining them.

1230
01:40:02,109 --> 01:40:04,861
<i>Now passing -
Tomainia's light artillery.</i>

1231
01:40:09,658 --> 01:40:11,659
Hmm. That's very light.

1232
01:40:11,744 --> 01:40:13,578
<i>And here come the armored tanks...</i>

1233
01:40:13,662 --> 01:40:15,496
<i>the pride of Tomainia's army.</i>

1234
01:40:15,581 --> 01:40:18,916
<i>The latest design,
the last word in modern warfare.</i>

1235
01:40:19,918 --> 01:40:22,003
Wait a minute.
Where's the propellers?

1236
01:40:22,087 --> 01:40:24,255
- Propellers?
- Sure. For going under the water.

1237
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:26,341
- Tanks that go under the water?
- Submarine work!

1238
01:40:26,425 --> 01:40:30,094
You never heard of aero-marine tanks that
go under the water and then fly up-a-stairs?

1239
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:33,181
- What's that?
- Tanks that go under the water and fly in the air.

1240
01:40:33,265 --> 01:40:35,433
Oh, yes. Those are obsolete now.

1241
01:40:35,517 --> 01:40:37,769
We're concentrating
on flying dreadnoughts.

1242
01:40:37,853 --> 01:40:40,229
Flying dreadnoughts.

1243
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:46,986
- What's that?
- My planes!

1244
01:40:47,071 --> 01:40:50,448
<i>Now passing -
Hynkel's flying division number 34.</i>

1245
01:40:50,532 --> 01:40:52,116
Our planes!

1246
01:40:57,456 --> 01:40:59,832
You're right. They're yours.

1247
01:41:24,983 --> 01:41:26,150
Ah, Garbitsch.

1248
01:41:27,319 --> 01:41:29,237
The invasion of Osterlich.

1249
01:41:29,321 --> 01:41:33,408
It's all so simple. Our troops, tanks
and guns will be hidden along the border.

1250
01:41:33,492 --> 01:41:36,494
To disarm suspicion, you will go hunting -
duck shooting or something.

1251
01:41:36,578 --> 01:41:39,247
At the appointed time, you will show up
at the village of Pretzelberg...

1252
01:41:39,331 --> 01:41:43,167
meet the army, step into an automobile
and cross over into Osterlich.

1253
01:41:43,252 --> 01:41:46,170
Herring and I will be waiting
at the capital to receive you.

1254
01:41:46,255 --> 01:41:48,589
First, Napaloni must remove
his troops from the border.

1255
01:41:48,674 --> 01:41:50,258
That question will be decided tonight.

1256
01:41:50,342 --> 01:41:51,801
Where is Napaloni?

1257
01:41:51,885 --> 01:41:53,970
I'll see if I can find him.
In the meantime...

1258
01:41:54,054 --> 01:41:56,848
it might be advisable for you
to dance with Madam Napaloni.

1259
01:41:58,517 --> 01:41:59,976
It'll carry weight.

1260
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:01,686
You mean I will carry weight.

1261
01:42:05,732 --> 01:42:07,525
You find him. Let me know at once.

1262
01:42:12,948 --> 01:42:16,117
- Madam Napaloni.
- Your Excellency.

1263
01:42:16,201 --> 01:42:18,619
Why so triste?

1264
01:42:18,704 --> 01:42:20,538
'Cause I no speak-a.

1265
01:42:20,622 --> 01:42:22,790
No? May I have the pleasure
of this dance?

1266
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:24,167
Oh, yes.

1267
01:42:24,251 --> 01:42:25,751
Allow me.

1268
01:42:56,575 --> 01:42:59,827
Madam, your dancing was superb.

1269
01:42:59,912 --> 01:43:01,204
Excellent.

1270
01:43:01,288 --> 01:43:02,788
Very good.

1271
01:43:02,873 --> 01:43:04,123
Good.

1272
01:43:17,179 --> 01:43:18,930
- Ah, my dear Adenoid!
- Benzine!

1273
01:43:19,014 --> 01:43:21,766
I've been-a looking for you all evening.
What do you say we have a sandwich...

1274
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:25,228
go to some quiet little place where we can
sit down and talk-a things over, huh?

1275
01:43:25,312 --> 01:43:28,773
- As you wish.
- An excellent idea! Gentlemen, to the buffet.

1276
01:43:28,857 --> 01:43:30,525
Of course. This way.

1277
01:43:48,961 --> 01:43:50,628
There's an old Tomainian proverb.

1278
01:43:55,551 --> 01:43:58,803
That's very funny! I wish I understand it.

1279
01:43:58,887 --> 01:44:00,429
Now, about the border situation.

1280
01:44:00,514 --> 01:44:02,723
- Ah, yes, yes. No problem.
- Oh, it should be no trouble at all.

1281
01:44:02,808 --> 01:44:03,975
- Shh, shh.
- Not at all.

1282
01:44:04,059 --> 01:44:05,226
- What's the matter?
- Wait.

1283
01:44:05,310 --> 01:44:07,311
Out!

1284
01:44:09,815 --> 01:44:11,899
You two, out!

1285
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:17,280
Out.

1286
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:22,577
- Out?
- Out.

1287
01:44:22,661 --> 01:44:23,995
Out?

1288
01:44:24,997 --> 01:44:26,163
Out.

1289
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:31,669
As I was saying, about the border question.

1290
01:44:31,753 --> 01:44:35,214
- Ah, yes, yes, yes.
- Just a matter of detail. Mere formalities.

1291
01:44:35,299 --> 01:44:36,382
Strawberries.

1292
01:44:36,466 --> 01:44:38,134
Pardon me.
Have you English mustard?

1293
01:44:38,218 --> 01:44:40,261
- English mustard, Your Excellency.
- That's the hot-a stuff?

1294
01:44:40,345 --> 01:44:41,804
- Very hot.
- Ah, good shape, good shape.

1295
01:44:41,888 --> 01:44:43,723
- Cream.
- Cream, Your Excellency.

1296
01:44:43,807 --> 01:44:47,018
Now, Hynkie, as far as I'm concerned,
I'm gonna make this very simple.

1297
01:44:47,102 --> 01:44:50,021
This is the treaty -
You agree not to invade Osterlich...

1298
01:44:50,105 --> 01:44:51,731
I agree not to invade Osterlich.

1299
01:44:51,815 --> 01:44:54,609
We sign-a the treaty,
then I remove-a my troops from the border.

1300
01:44:54,693 --> 01:44:56,861
Good. In other words, when your troops
are off the border, I sign.

1301
01:44:56,945 --> 01:44:58,112
- That's-a right.
- Very good.

1302
01:44:58,196 --> 01:45:01,699
Oh, just a minute.
You don't understand.

1303
01:45:01,783 --> 01:45:04,869
First we sign-a the treaty,
then I remove-a the troops.

1304
01:45:04,953 --> 01:45:07,038
Precisely. I sign when your troops
are off the border.

1305
01:45:07,122 --> 01:45:09,957
Just a minute.
Hey, Spook, treaty.

1306
01:45:10,792 --> 01:45:12,084
Hold-a this.

1307
01:45:12,169 --> 01:45:13,628
Now, look.

1308
01:45:13,712 --> 01:45:15,880
You a-sign this-a treaty a-first...

1309
01:45:15,964 --> 01:45:18,341
then I remove-a the troops after.

1310
01:45:18,425 --> 01:45:21,385
- Well, what are we arguing about?
- You just said I remove-a the troops a-first.

1311
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:23,888
You don't expect me to sign
while your troops are there on the border?

1312
01:45:23,972 --> 01:45:26,098
You don't expect me to remove-a
the troops until you sign?

1313
01:45:26,183 --> 01:45:27,224
- Why not?
- Why should I?

1314
01:45:27,309 --> 01:45:29,226
- Why shouldn't you? Osterlich is a free country.
- So?

1315
01:45:29,311 --> 01:45:31,479
Your soldiers are there,
on the Osterlich border!

1316
01:45:31,563 --> 01:45:33,939
And they'll stay there
until you sign this-a treaty!

1317
01:45:34,024 --> 01:45:36,317
You'll take them off, or I'll blow them off!

1318
01:45:36,401 --> 01:45:38,235
Gentlemen, this won't get us anywhere.

1319
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,571
Your Excellency, to quote
an old Latin phrase -

1320
01:45:42,366 --> 01:45:44,075
He's a-right! Speak-a to him!

1321
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:45,159
Strawberries.

1322
01:45:45,243 --> 01:45:47,495
Where's my-a sandwich?
Well, give me another one!

1323
01:45:47,579 --> 01:45:49,830
- Can't we sit down and discuss this -
- I'm a guest-a here.

1324
01:45:49,915 --> 01:45:52,083
Nobody talk to me in my own-a joint
like that!

1325
01:45:52,167 --> 01:45:54,543
Can't we sit down and discuss this thing
without passion?

1326
01:45:54,628 --> 01:45:57,004
I am not-a passionate.
I am-a just, that's all.

1327
01:45:57,089 --> 01:45:59,590
I want him to sign-a the treaty.
I'll remove the troops.

1328
01:45:59,675 --> 01:46:02,134
Can't you understand?
What would my people think...

1329
01:46:02,219 --> 01:46:05,680
signing such a treaty when your soldiers
are there on the Osterlich border?

1330
01:46:05,764 --> 01:46:07,807
I will not-a move a-soldiers
until you-a sign!

1331
01:46:07,891 --> 01:46:10,768
Not until you clear that border
will I sign anything.

1332
01:46:10,852 --> 01:46:13,187
- Then my soldiers remain!
- Then I kick them off!

1333
01:46:13,271 --> 01:46:17,108
One move-a from you, Hynkie, and my artillery
take-a like this and blow you to pieces!

1334
01:46:17,192 --> 01:46:20,903
Yes, and my aeroplanes will bomb
your artillery like that!

1335
01:46:20,987 --> 01:46:23,030
You want to start a world-a war?
I'll get you one!

1336
01:46:23,115 --> 01:46:25,366
You and the world!
I'll throw in the ocean!

1337
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:26,784
- Mmm!
- Gentlemen, please!

1338
01:46:38,797 --> 01:46:43,342
I'm-a coming home!
I cannot talk to this ignoramus!

1339
01:46:43,427 --> 01:46:44,385
Strawberries!

1340
01:46:44,469 --> 01:46:46,804
Your Excellency,
we have a very important position...

1341
01:46:46,888 --> 01:46:48,639
that I must urge upon you.

1342
01:46:48,724 --> 01:46:51,142
I know what you must -

1343
01:46:54,396 --> 01:46:58,190
If you would -

1344
01:47:06,575 --> 01:47:08,409
What's wrong?

1345
01:47:08,493 --> 01:47:10,995
I don't give a hoopy!
I got-a my guns here in the pass!

1346
01:47:11,079 --> 01:47:13,664
If he start-a something,
I'll blow him to "passes!"

1347
01:47:17,753 --> 01:47:20,421
Excellency, what's the matter?
What ails you? What has -

1348
01:47:20,505 --> 01:47:23,591
- Your Excellency, this isn't like you.
- Hey! What is the matter?

1349
01:47:23,675 --> 01:47:25,426
Hey, Garbitsch, come here!

1350
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:27,178
What is the matter with-a Hynkie?

1351
01:47:27,262 --> 01:47:28,929
He's put mustard on his strawberries.

1352
01:47:29,014 --> 01:47:31,932
Mustard -
What else-a can you expect from Hynkie?

1353
01:47:36,188 --> 01:47:37,605
Il Dig-a-Ditchy!

1354
01:47:37,689 --> 01:47:39,440
What? What's the matter? What?

1355
01:47:39,524 --> 01:47:42,735
My little bambino!

1356
01:47:56,124 --> 01:47:57,875
...the Bacterian -
... Tomainia -

1357
01:47:59,795 --> 01:48:02,213
You cannot treat-a
the Bacterian people this way!

1358
01:48:02,297 --> 01:48:05,883
I'll take the Bacterian people
and I'll tear them apart like this!

1359
01:48:05,967 --> 01:48:08,177
- Excellency, please!
- Look! Look what he's-a doing!

1360
01:48:08,261 --> 01:48:11,889
It's an insult to my people!

1361
01:48:11,973 --> 01:48:14,517
Look, he's-a pulling spaghetti!
The spaghetti!

1362
01:48:14,601 --> 01:48:16,852
He either sign-a the treaty,
or we have a war!

1363
01:48:16,937 --> 01:48:18,437
- Ooh!
- Listen! Listen!

1364
01:48:18,522 --> 01:48:21,690
Give me a-something! Quick!
Give me a-something! I want to -

1365
01:48:25,403 --> 01:48:27,905
- But it's all right. I have an appointment.
- What's this?

1366
01:48:27,989 --> 01:48:30,533
I'm from the international press.
How's the conference progressing?

1367
01:48:30,617 --> 01:48:33,410
Very successfully. How did you get in?
Excuse me, will you?

1368
01:48:34,663 --> 01:48:36,831
How did this man get in here?

1369
01:48:36,915 --> 01:48:40,167
You know the regulations of the palace in
regard to reporters. Go down to Captain Block.

1370
01:48:40,252 --> 01:48:42,837
Tell him not to allow anyone else to enter
the palace under any circumstances tonight.

1371
01:48:42,921 --> 01:48:44,964
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

1372
01:48:48,176 --> 01:48:51,679
Of course, there are minor details
to be cleaned up, things that you must -

1373
01:48:52,931 --> 01:48:54,598
Excuse me. We're very busy.

1374
01:48:59,354 --> 01:49:01,480
- Oh!
- Gentlemen, please!

1375
01:49:01,565 --> 01:49:03,983
The press are outside. The whole world
will know that we're fighting.

1376
01:49:04,067 --> 01:49:06,610
- So what?
- Can't we come to some agreement?

1377
01:49:06,695 --> 01:49:09,113
- Not until he-a signs!
- I sign nothing!

1378
01:49:09,197 --> 01:49:11,282
Your Excellency,
I must speak to you alone.

1379
01:49:11,366 --> 01:49:13,117
- Do you mind?
- Mind? I don't a-mind!

1380
01:49:13,201 --> 01:49:15,452
- What is it?
- Sign. Sign.

1381
01:49:15,537 --> 01:49:17,079
Why should he have the advantage?

1382
01:49:17,163 --> 01:49:19,164
What does it matter,
a mere scrap of paper?

1383
01:49:19,249 --> 01:49:21,166
The moment you sign,
he'll take his troops off the border.

1384
01:49:21,251 --> 01:49:23,294
We can move in without losing a man.

1385
01:49:24,713 --> 01:49:26,046
I'll sign.

1386
01:49:26,131 --> 01:49:28,215
What?
Hold-a this!

1387
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:30,551
Ah, my little Hynkie!

1388
01:49:30,635 --> 01:49:34,221
My-a dictator brother!
I knew we have-a no trouble!

1389
01:49:39,978 --> 01:49:43,397
Two prisoners escaped in officers' uniforms!
Officers tied up in the guard room!

1390
01:49:44,149 --> 01:49:46,483
Sound the alarm!
Two prisoners escaped! Come on!

1391
01:50:05,003 --> 01:50:06,837
The planes are searching for us.

1392
01:50:06,922 --> 01:50:08,255
Let's make for the woods.

1393
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:11,008
No. We must keep in the open.
The border's that way.

1394
01:50:12,761 --> 01:50:14,845
The invasion of Osterlich.

1395
01:50:16,097 --> 01:50:18,682
Now... or never.

1396
01:50:24,481 --> 01:50:25,814
Ducks!

1397
01:50:30,779 --> 01:50:32,529
Did you hear that?

1398
01:50:32,614 --> 01:50:34,740
Came from over there. Come on.

1399
01:50:45,710 --> 01:50:47,086
<i>Da Blitzen!</i>

1400
01:50:50,090 --> 01:50:51,590
Cheese and crackers!

1401
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:55,761
<i>...da Blitzen!</i>

1402
01:50:56,638 --> 01:50:59,431
A yodeler, huh?
Where'd you get that outfit?

1403
01:50:59,516 --> 01:51:01,225
- What?
- Don't answer back!

1404
01:51:03,687 --> 01:51:06,730
Where's your partner? Where's Schultz?
You won't talk, huh?

1405
01:51:06,815 --> 01:51:09,650
- He'll talk when he gets into camp!
- Come on!

1406
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:15,406
There it is -
the village of Pretzelberg.

1407
01:51:15,490 --> 01:51:17,157
Pretzelberg.

1408
01:51:17,242 --> 01:51:20,077
If we can pass through there,
we're safe across the Osterlich border.

1409
01:51:20,161 --> 01:51:22,079
- Couldn't we go through the woods?
- Of course not.

1410
01:51:22,163 --> 01:51:24,832
The woods are swarming with soldiers.
They'd suspect us at once.

1411
01:51:24,916 --> 01:51:28,460
We must face the music.
If you see anyone, don't look right or left.

1412
01:51:28,545 --> 01:51:31,255
We must bluff our way through.
Remember, you're a storm trooper.

1413
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:33,590
Here they come.

1414
01:51:42,267 --> 01:51:44,059
Can you see what they're doing?

1415
01:51:47,188 --> 01:51:49,732
- They're looking this way.
- Well, pay no attention. Keep going.

1416
01:51:52,861 --> 01:51:55,779
They're beginning to follow us.
Shall we run?

1417
01:51:55,864 --> 01:51:57,364
Certainly not.

1418
01:51:57,449 --> 01:51:59,616
- Just a little bit?
- Keep walking.

1419
01:52:01,953 --> 01:52:04,705
We could walk a little faster.

1420
01:52:04,789 --> 01:52:07,124
Hmm? Make up your mind.

1421
01:52:18,219 --> 01:52:20,471
- Perhaps we'd better slow down.
- No, no. Keep going.

1422
01:52:20,555 --> 01:52:22,222
- There's no hurry.
- Come on.

1423
01:52:25,894 --> 01:52:27,061
- What is it?
- He's here!

1424
01:52:27,145 --> 01:52:29,730
What? Bugler! Sound assembly!

1425
01:52:39,491 --> 01:52:42,659
Company! Attention!

1426
01:52:43,745 --> 01:52:46,246
Present... arms!

1427
01:52:49,918 --> 01:52:53,128
- You don't want to change your mind and turn back?
- No, keep going. Keep going.

1428
01:52:54,506 --> 01:52:57,007
- Hail Hynkel.
- Order... arms!

1429
01:52:58,843 --> 01:53:01,678
Your Excellency will be pleased to know
that everything is under control.

1430
01:53:01,763 --> 01:53:03,430
- Good.
- Good.

1431
01:53:03,515 --> 01:53:06,934
I have been in continued communication
with Marshal Herring in Osterlich, sir.

1432
01:53:07,018 --> 01:53:09,019
The route ahead of us is well-guarded.

1433
01:53:09,104 --> 01:53:12,773
And at the back of us are 200 tanks,
50 armored cars and 500 machine guns.

1434
01:53:12,857 --> 01:53:14,691
- Is that -
- Good.

1435
01:53:14,776 --> 01:53:17,194
- Good.
- Are we ready to start?

1436
01:53:17,278 --> 01:53:18,529
- Yes.
- Yes.

1437
01:53:19,781 --> 01:53:21,156
Gentlemen.

1438
01:53:27,705 --> 01:53:30,374
Schultz, I'm certainly happy
to see you with us again.

1439
01:53:30,458 --> 01:53:31,792
Thank you.

1440
01:53:38,883 --> 01:53:42,010
- Where are we going?
- You're invading Osterlich.

1441
01:54:55,293 --> 01:54:58,128
Mr. Jaeckel! Mr. Jaeckel!

1442
01:54:58,213 --> 01:55:01,298
- Hannah!
- Mr. Jaeckel, look, they're coming!

1443
01:55:45,802 --> 01:55:47,678
Present... arms!

1444
01:55:49,097 --> 01:55:51,098
Hail Hynkel!

1445
01:55:51,182 --> 01:55:53,433
Hail Hynkel!

1446
01:55:53,518 --> 01:55:55,727
Present... arms!

1447
01:55:57,438 --> 01:56:00,774
Your Excellency,
the world awaits your word.

1448
01:56:33,683 --> 01:56:35,726
What's happened to him?
He looks strange.

1449
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:37,686
And what's Schultz doing here?

1450
01:56:37,770 --> 01:56:39,104
Pardoned, I suppose.

1451
01:56:51,326 --> 01:57:04,254
Here.

1452
01:57:06,382 --> 01:57:08,675
His Excellency, Herr Garbitsch...

1453
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:12,137
Secretary of the Interior,
Minister of Propaganda.

1454
01:57:16,976 --> 01:57:19,019
<i>"Corona veniet delectis. "</i>

1455
01:57:19,103 --> 01:57:21,313
"Victory shall come to the worthy. "

1456
01:57:22,190 --> 01:57:27,402
Today, democracy, liberty and equality
are words to fool the people.

1457
01:57:27,487 --> 01:57:30,197
No nation can progress
with such ideas.

1458
01:57:30,281 --> 01:57:31,865
They stand in the way of action.

1459
01:57:31,949 --> 01:57:33,867
Therefore, we frankly abolish them.

1460
01:57:34,869 --> 01:57:39,539
In the future, each man will serve the interest
of the state with absolute obedience.

1461
01:57:39,624 --> 01:57:41,666
Let him who refuses beware.

1462
01:57:41,751 --> 01:57:46,129
The rights of citizenship will be taken away
from all Jews and other non-Aryans.

1463
01:57:46,214 --> 01:57:49,549
They are inferior,
and therefore enemies of the state.

1464
01:57:49,634 --> 01:57:53,053
It is the duty of all true Aryans
to hate and despise them.

1465
01:57:54,263 --> 01:57:57,307
Henceforth, this nation is annexed
to the Tomainian Empire...

1466
01:57:57,392 --> 01:58:01,186
and the people of this nation will obey
the laws bestowed upon us by our great leader...

1467
01:58:02,563 --> 01:58:06,733
the dictator of Tomainia,
the conqueror of Osterlich...

1468
01:58:06,818 --> 01:58:10,695
the future emperor of the world.

1469
01:58:11,739 --> 01:58:13,448
You must speak.

1470
01:58:14,450 --> 01:58:15,909
I can't.

1471
01:58:15,993 --> 01:58:18,578
You must. It's our only hope.

1472
01:58:21,374 --> 01:58:22,707
Hope.

1473
01:59:10,548 --> 01:59:12,132
I'm sorry...

1474
01:59:12,216 --> 01:59:14,134
but I don't want to be an emperor.

1475
01:59:14,218 --> 01:59:16,303
That's not my business.

1476
01:59:16,387 --> 01:59:18,889
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

1477
01:59:18,973 --> 01:59:20,891
I should like to help everyone,
if possible -

1478
01:59:20,975 --> 01:59:24,227
Jew, gentile, black man, white.

1479
01:59:24,312 --> 01:59:27,898
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.

1480
01:59:27,982 --> 01:59:31,234
We want to live by each other's happiness,
not by each other's misery.

1481
01:59:31,319 --> 01:59:33,737
We don't want to hate and despise
one another.

1482
01:59:33,821 --> 01:59:36,990
In this world, there's room for everyone,
and the good earth is rich...

1483
01:59:37,074 --> 01:59:38,992
and can provide for everyone.

1484
01:59:39,076 --> 01:59:42,120
The way of life can be free and beautiful.

1485
01:59:42,205 --> 01:59:44,247
But we have lost the way.

1486
01:59:44,332 --> 01:59:46,875
Greed has poisoned men's souls...

1487
01:59:46,959 --> 01:59:49,252
has barricaded the world with hate...

1488
01:59:49,337 --> 01:59:52,255
has goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.

1489
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:55,717
We have developed speed,
but we have shut ourselves in.

1490
01:59:55,801 --> 01:59:58,845
Machinery that gives abundance
has left us in want.

1491
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:02,849
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.

1492
02:00:02,934 --> 02:00:05,769
We think too much and feel too little.

1493
02:00:05,853 --> 02:00:08,438
More than machinery,
we need humanity.

1494
02:00:08,523 --> 02:00:12,108
More than cleverness,
we need kindness and gentleness.

1495
02:00:12,193 --> 02:00:16,446
Without these qualities, life will be violent,
and all will be lost.

1496
02:00:16,531 --> 02:00:19,241
The aeroplane and the radio
have brought us closer together.

1497
02:00:19,325 --> 02:00:22,536
These very nature of these inventions
cries out for the goodness in men...

1498
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:26,039
cries out for universal brotherhood,
for the unity of us all.

1499
02:00:26,123 --> 02:00:29,125
Even now, my voice is reaching
millions throughout the world...

1500
02:00:29,210 --> 02:00:32,420
millions of despairing men,
women and little children...

1501
02:00:32,505 --> 02:00:37,509
victims of a system that makes men torture
and imprison innocent people.

1502
02:00:37,593 --> 02:00:40,971
To those who can hear me I say,
do not despair.

1503
02:00:41,055 --> 02:00:44,224
The misery that is now upon us
is but the passing of greed...

1504
02:00:44,308 --> 02:00:48,061
the bitterness of men who fear
the way of human progress.

1505
02:00:48,145 --> 02:00:51,439
The hate of men will pass,
and dictators die...

1506
02:00:51,524 --> 02:00:55,068
and the power they took from the people
will return to the people.

1507
02:00:55,152 --> 02:00:58,947
And so long as men die,
liberty will never perish.

1508
02:01:00,324 --> 02:01:02,993
Soldiers,
don't give yourselves to brutes...

1509
02:01:03,077 --> 02:01:06,746
men who despise you, enslave you,
who regiment your lives...

1510
02:01:06,831 --> 02:01:09,082
tell you what to do,
what to think and what to feel...

1511
02:01:09,166 --> 02:01:13,503
who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle,
use you as cannon fodder!

1512
02:01:13,588 --> 02:01:16,172
Don't give yourselves
to these unnatural men -

1513
02:01:16,257 --> 02:01:19,843
machine men with machine minds
and machine hearts!

1514
02:01:19,927 --> 02:01:23,680
You are not machines!
You are not cattle! You are men!

1515
02:01:23,764 --> 02:01:26,016
You have the love of humanity
in your hearts.

1516
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:28,435
You don't hate.
Only the unloved hate.

1517
02:01:28,519 --> 02:01:30,437
The unloved and the unnatural.

1518
02:01:30,521 --> 02:01:34,024
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery,
fight for liberty!

1519
02:01:34,108 --> 02:01:36,151
In the 17th chapter of Saint Luke
it is written...

1520
02:01:36,235 --> 02:01:37,861
"The kingdom of God is within man. "

1521
02:01:37,945 --> 02:01:41,531
Not one man nor a group of men,
but in all men - in you!

1522
02:01:41,616 --> 02:01:43,658
You the people have the power -

1523
02:01:43,743 --> 02:01:46,745
the power to create machines,
the power to create happiness!

1524
02:01:46,829 --> 02:01:50,373
You the people have the power
to make this life free and beautiful...

1525
02:01:50,458 --> 02:01:52,709
to make this life a wonderful adventure.

1526
02:01:52,793 --> 02:01:55,962
Then, in the name of democracy,
let us use that power!

1527
02:01:56,047 --> 02:01:57,631
Let us all unite!

1528
02:01:57,715 --> 02:02:01,134
Let us fight for a new world,
a decent world...

1529
02:02:01,218 --> 02:02:02,969
that will give men a chance to work...

1530
02:02:03,054 --> 02:02:06,056
that will give youth a future
and old age a security.

1531
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:09,100
By the promise of these things,
brutes have risen to power.

1532
02:02:09,185 --> 02:02:13,063
But they lie. They do not fulfill that promise.
They never will!

1533
02:02:13,147 --> 02:02:16,900
Dictators free themselves,
but they enslave the people.

1534
02:02:16,984 --> 02:02:20,070
Now let us fight to fulfill that promise!

1535
02:02:20,154 --> 02:02:22,405
Let us fight to free the world...

1536
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:26,076
to do away with national barriers,
to do away with greed...

1537
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:28,161
with hate and intolerance.

1538
02:02:28,245 --> 02:02:32,832
Let us fight for a world of reason,
a world where science and progress...

1539
02:02:32,917 --> 02:02:35,251
will lead to all men's happiness.

1540
02:02:35,336 --> 02:02:39,673
Soldiers, in the name of democracy,
let us all unite!

1541
02:03:04,782 --> 02:03:06,074
Hannah...

1542
02:03:07,034 --> 02:03:08,535
can you hear me?

1543
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:13,206
<i>Wherever you are, look up, Hannah.</i>

1544
02:03:14,041 --> 02:03:16,292
<i>The clouds are lifting.</i>

1545
02:03:16,377 --> 02:03:18,378
<i>The sun is breaking through.</i>

1546
02:03:18,879 --> 02:03:22,382
<i>We are coming out of the darkness
and into the light.</i>

1547
02:03:22,466 --> 02:03:26,803
<i>We are coming into a new world,
a kindlier world...</i>

1548
02:03:26,887 --> 02:03:29,139
<i>where men will rise above their hate...</i>

1549
02:03:29,223 --> 02:03:31,891
<i>their greed and brutality.</i>

1550
02:03:32,893 --> 02:03:34,561
<i>Look up, Hannah.</i>

1551
02:03:34,645 --> 02:03:37,230
<i>The soul of man has been given wings...</i>

1552
02:03:37,314 --> 02:03:40,316
<i>and at last he is beginning to fly.</i>

1553
02:03:40,401 --> 02:03:42,652
<i>He is flying into the rainbow...</i>

1554
02:03:42,737 --> 02:03:46,156
<i>into the light of hope,
into the future -</i>

1555
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:48,324
<i>the glorious future...</i>

1556
02:03:48,409 --> 02:03:51,327
<i>that belongs to you, to me...</i>

1557
02:03:51,412 --> 02:03:53,246
<i>and to all of us.</i>

1558
02:03:53,330 --> 02:03:56,040
<i>Look up, Hannah. Look up.</i>

1559
02:04:21,192 --> 02:04:24,360
Hannah, did you hear that?

1560
02:04:26,530 --> 02:04:27,864
Listen.
