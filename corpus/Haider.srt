1
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,349
Mother! Oh mother!!

2
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,785
Hang on... Commander...

3
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,564
Mother!

4
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,174
It's a case of severe appendicitis.

5
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,270
We need to operate immediately.

6
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,276
He is the face of our movement.

7
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,482
We cannot risk going to the hospital.

8
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,210
We will have to
take the risk, Zahoor.

9
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,789
Or tomorrow the press will report...

10
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,492
that Commander Ikhlaq Latif died...

11
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,427
of a terrifying explosion
of his appendix.

12
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,362
I'll arrange an ambulance and
will meet you by the lake in an hour.

13
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,063
Where will you operate?

14
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,501
At home.

15
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,531
- "What is a home?"

16
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,763
"It is brothers and sisters..."
- And sisters.

17
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,501
"and fathers and mothers."
- And mothers.

18
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:58,278
"It is unselfish acts and kindly sharing."
- Sharing.

19
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:02,252
"And showing your loved ones
you're always car|ng..."

20
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,617
- Caring.

21
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,157
"What is a house?"

22
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,359
Doctor, how are you?
- I am fine.

23
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,093
- You got delayed today...
- Another surgery.

24
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,406
Let the doctor go...

25
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,159
Lower the heat a bit...

26
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,324
And the flames within you...

27
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,074
They can burn this house down!

28
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,745
You'll have the
village burnt to ashes.

29
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,383
Doctor...
- Yes.

30
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,026
Do you know what you're doing?

31
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,030
Exactly what a doctor
should be doing.

32
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,031
Which side are you on?

33
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,197
I am for life.

34
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,210
- Move.

35
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:56,660
Salam Alaikum! This is Gul Khan.

36
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,595
It's a cordon and search operation.

37
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:06,170
Every man and boy is ordered to assemble
in the school grounds immediately.

38
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,564
Women and children may stay home.

39
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,634
It's a cordon and search operation.

40
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:20,312
Every man and boy is ordered to assemble
in the school grounds immediately.

41
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,448
Hilaal!
There's a crackdown in our village.

42
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:33,129
Every man and boy is ordered to assemble
in the school grounds immediately.

43
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,766
- This crackdown may go on all day...

44
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,106
This before meals, this afterwards.

45
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,412
If the pain gets worse, inject this.

46
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,401
Be careful...

47
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,343
If they suspect something...

48
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,743
no one will survive.

49
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,480
Neither you...

50
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,051
nor I...

51
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,060
And Haider?

52
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,430
God is his guardian.

53
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,400
He will take care of him...

54
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,575
- Save me... Oh, Lord!

55
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,340
- I don't know!!

56
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,699
- Ikhlaq Latif...

57
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,759
Surrender yourself...

58
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:06,009
- Indian law will give you a fair trial.

59
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,514
Lay down your weapons
and come out.

60
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,427
- You don't have a chance.

61
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,394
Surrender or die.

62
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,057
Sir... Ikhlaq Latif is alive...

63
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,459
We have killed the
other two millitants.

64
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,121
Shall we send in reinforcements?

65
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,065
No bloody militant
dead or alive...

66
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,535
is worth my soldier's life...

67
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,398
In the name of Allah
most merciful...

68
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,101
- Load...

69
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,685
Ready...

70
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,101
Fire!

71
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,071
Everybody line up outside
with your IDs and bags.

72
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,652
Where are you going?

73
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,196
Srinagar.

74
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,493
You are coming from?
- Aligarh.

75
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,068
What do you do there?

76
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,394
I'm a student.

77
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,493
College ID?

78
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,448
Subject of research?

79
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,713
Revolutionary poets of British India.

80
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,217
Which town do you belong to?

81
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,690
Islamabad.

82
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,657
- The captain is out at the check post...

83
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,993
Any message for him?

84
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,469
Salam Alaikum!

85
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,183
Come.

86
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,123
- Sir, I want to interview you...

87
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,525
Go ahead... interview me now...

88
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,220
Ah, thanks!

89
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,693
So...

90
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,241
I'll thrash you!

91
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,515
Your love for Kashmir...
is expressed as Islamabad?

92
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,549
What?

93
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,586
Sir, Islamabad is another name
for Anantnag.

94
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,020
I know.

95
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,683
But for us...
there's just one Islamabad.

96
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,524
In Pakistan...

97
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,457
Nice poems

98
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,100
Rather difficult though.

99
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:34,629
Be careful with such beautiful inspiration.

100
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,197
Okay?
Take this.

101
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:44,147
Haider, that burrito
wouldn't budge.

102
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,047
I told him that you are a poet,
not a militant.

103
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,714
And we are engaged to be married.

104
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,221
He wanted proof.

105
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,124
I told him to read your diary.

106
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,024
You wrote your poems for me...

107
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,221
since childhood.

108
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,293
Where are we going?

109
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,966
To see your mother.

110
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:06,159
Where is she?

111
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,063
At your uncle's.

112
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,672
Stop the car.

113
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,342
I have to go home.

114
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,715
Haider...

115
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:33,428
There isn't much of a home
left in what remains...

116
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,313
Father, wait...

117
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,315
I'm running late...
- Won't take long...

118
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:29,208
Let the petals fill with colour...

119
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:35,184
Let the breeze ruffle the spring...

120
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:41,725
Let the breeze ruffle the spring.

121
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,126
The next verse?

122
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:49,130
Let the breeze ruffle the spring...

123
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,362
Come along, my love...
Awake the garden to life.

124
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,260
There... the vase has fallen...

125
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,215
That's my bat.

126
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,285
Hold this.

127
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,253
Dad's shoes...

128
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,999
Haider...
- Yes.

129
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,471
Don't fight it...

130
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:08,739
What?

131
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:11,708
You can on]...

132
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,316
Where's the shoe brush?

133
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,150
Haider...

134
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,491
You can on]...

135
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,066
Please.

136
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,519
What is Arshee's car doing here?

137
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,782
Slop!

138
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,003
Now that is quite an interview!

139
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,068
Brother...

140
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,638
Of course, you couldn't
drop me at the airport

141
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,479
You don't get it...

142
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,109
Don't say a word!

143
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,187
- Brother...

144
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,347
Listen...

145
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,354
Ifl ever see you around her...

146
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,328
you will disappear...

147
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,523
just like your father.

148
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,362
You get me? Like your...

149
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,667
Arshee, move aside.

150
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,765
Leave us! Please.

151
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,347
- Come with me.

152
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,418
- Let go of my hand.

153
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,510
Come with me.

154
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,090
- You never heard my caution.

155
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,624
You let her do as she pleases.

156
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,031
And look now.

157
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,028
She won't leave the house.

158
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,506
I will not stop working.

159
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:24,706
- What did you say?

160
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,717
Look at me.
What did you say?

161
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,446
Alright, calm down.

162
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,217
You have to stop seeing Haider.

163
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,393
Lucky is right about it.

164
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:44,227
His life won't be the same
after the doctor's arrest.

165
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,329
The families of militants
can neither get passports...

166
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,700
nor government jobs.

167
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,645
You know how it is.

168
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,411
Yes. Very well...

169
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,345
See what I mean?

170
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,322
She is a stubborn one...

171
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,288
Swear by the Koran.

172
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,123
Place your hand on it.

173
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,525
Arshee...

174
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,267
Arshee...

175
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,264
Open the door.

176
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,010
Arshee...

177
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,774
There's another flight
to Bangalore at two.

178
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,382
I don't want to go.

179
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,147
Don't be a fool.

180
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,448
"Don't want to go..."

181
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,751
You don't turn down such a big job.

182
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,617
Don't take it lightly.

183
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:45,357
She has the mind of a child...

184
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,628
- I'll speak to her.

185
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,226
Here... I swear by the Koran...

186
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,169
Thank you.

187
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,490
Good to see you...

188
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,002
Why are you laughing?

189
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,308
Sorry!

190
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:43,210
You are so out of tune.

191
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,710
I have been
begging you to teach me

192
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,774
Since college...

193
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:51,045
Teach me.

194
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,018
Be my master.

195
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,622
And you look away.

196
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,395
I'll have to sing like this now...

197
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,089
Why don't you?

198
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,100
Please.
- No.

199
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:09,264
Darling sis-in-law.

200
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,107
My angel...

201
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,311
Haider!

202
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,056
You are home!

203
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,649
Not a word of your arrival...

204
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,707
You've lost so much weight...

205
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,710
- Grown a beard too...

206
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,651
Have you...

207
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,092
written your thesis?

208
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,294
Why are you so quiet?

209
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,041
Say something?

210
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,749
My angel...

211
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,688
- These are hard times.

212
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,724
It's a time for patience.

213
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,733
The Koran tells us.

214
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,737
- God is with the patient.

215
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,005
I've filed a petition in court

216
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,508
It will take some time...

217
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,376
God-willing, all will be well soon.

218
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,421
It doesn't look like it though.

219
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,419
What?

220
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,130
The two of you seem quite happy...

221
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,561
with my father's disappearance.

222
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,203
What?

223
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:58,204
The two of you seem very happy...

224
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,077
with my father's disappearance.

225
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,075
- Haider...

226
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,215
Have you lost it?

227
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,448
What are you saying?

228
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,382
Exactly what I see...

229
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:12,421
dear uncle...

230
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,288
Has your musical been on for a while?

231
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,791
Or did this romantic production begin..

232
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:26,566
after father's disappearance?

233
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,307
Sis-in-law...

234
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,476
How dare you!

235
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,739
Is this the way to talk to your mother?

236
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,283
ls this what you learnt in college?

237
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,077
- S is-in-law...

238
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,644
Let his father return!

239
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:46,746
He's a boy...

240
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,349
Let it be...

241
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,185
It will affect your health...

242
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,058
Come along...

243
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,064
Sis-in-law...

244
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,288
Haider...

245
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,768
I am sorry.

246
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:10,104
Haider... I will explain...

247
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,544
Sis-in-law...

248
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,215
My angel...

249
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,021
Sis-in-law...

250
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,757
Haider...

251
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,665
Come back...
It is time for curfew now.

252
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,768
My angel...

253
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,534
The army will grab him too.

254
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:37,471
Please! Stop him!

255
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,066
He will be fine.

256
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,371
Please get him back.

257
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,412
Sis-in-law...

258
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,475
I'll manage it...

259
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:47,811
Don't worn].

260
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,315
Hello!

261
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,151
Whom do you want?

262
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:27,713
Salman?
Just a moment.

263
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,190
Telephone.

264
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,420
Hello!
Whom do you want?

265
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,497
This call is for you.

266
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,580
Hello...

267
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,781
Whom do you want?

268
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,379
Salman or Salman?

269
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:58,149
Or Salmanl?

270
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,782
Do you mind taking the trouble...

271
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,353
to introduce yourself?

272
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,516
Your daddy!

273
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,153
Superintendent of Police...

274
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,253
Pan/ez Lone

275
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,600
Sir... Sorry sir!

276
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,630
Pan/ez sir...

277
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:21,372
- Hello sir...

278
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,346
Do we pay you to sing and dance?

279
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,308
I apologise, sir!

280
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,175
Do you know Haider?

281
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,383
<i>Haider Meet.</i>

282
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,045
Yes sir! I know him very well.

283
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,315
We did high school together.

284
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,447
- Find him!

285
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,490
You'll find him around the lake...

286
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,422
Take him home
to keep an eye on him...

287
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,587
Yes, sir!

288
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:41,487
Have a good day...

289
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,599
You rascal! Didn't I tell you...

290
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:48,503
to disconnect the phone before
brother Sa|man's movie.

291
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,666
- No... not that.
- Want some of this?!

292
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:55,706
Do you want some of this?

293
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:07,454
Slop!

294
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,489
Where are you going?

295
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,457
What's in the bag?

296
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,515
Check it...
- Yes, sir.

297
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:11,458
Your identity card?

298
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,164
And raise your hands...
Frisk him...

299
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,435
Hello Captain.

300
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:22,995
Salman...

301
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,630
and Salman!

302
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,729
Hello Major!

303
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,339
Haider... How are you?

304
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,275
When did you get back?
- You know him?

305
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:30,680
Know him?!

306
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:35,044
He's my sweetheart

307
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,787
Come on, let's get out of here
before curfew sets in.

308
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,656
Or some Major will be welcoming us...

309
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,090
in a military camp.

310
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,221
Let me carry the bag.

311
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,590
Haider, come.

312
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,090
Goodbye, Colonel.

313
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,095
Seated?

314
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,296
Let's go.

315
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,740
In Kashmir, God in heaven...

316
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:05,675
and the army rules the earth.

317
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,512
- And the army has a bible...

318
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,176
AFS PA

319
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,419
The Armed Forces Special Power Act.

320
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:16,391
Khurram, my son is innocent.

321
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,457
He's been detained
at the Faraz cinema camp.

322
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,724
Please get him out.

323
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,525
Uncle...

324
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,072
I have no authority...

325
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,665
to free your boy.

326
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,014
I can't get him out...

327
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,617
but I can possibly save his life.

328
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:44,178
We have to shift him from
a camp to a prison.

329
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,084
We need to get him charged...

330
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:50,151
with a crime.

331
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,024
- Sir.
- It'll be a false charge.

332
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,528
A false charge.

333
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,230
That would get him
a court hearing.

334
00:35:56,588 --> 00:36:01,435
Meaning...
no chances of dissapearance...

335
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:04,699
- Okay?

336
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:16,247
C-H-U-T-Z-P-A-H..

337
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,988
Chutzpah...

338
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,089
It is what it is.

339
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:22,391
Chutzpah?

340
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,548
What is it?

341
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:29,427
Once a boy was arrested
for the murder of his parents.

342
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:36,197
In the courtroom he sought...

343
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:40,368
a lenient sentence from the judge.

344
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,711
Bewildered, the judge asked...

345
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,644
How do you expect mercy...

346
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,280
after killing your own parents?

347
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,419
The boy replied...

348
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,756
Because I am an orphan now.

349
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,056
That my friends is chutzpah.

350
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:05,067
A Hebrew word.

351
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,430
- It does rhyme a bit with AFSPA...

352
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,702
- And similar in meaning too.

353
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,077
AFSPA...

354
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,277
Chutzpah...

355
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,373
Chutzpah...
- AFSPA...

356
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,581
- What will you do now?

357
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:26,316
The same.

358
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:27,584
Chutzpah!

359
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:34,523
I'll look for my father.

360
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,635
Where? In camps?

361
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,434
In prisons?

362
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:48,143
All of Kashmir is a prison.

363
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,708
I will look for him everywhere.

364
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:10,361
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

365
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:16,995
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

366
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:26,672
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

367
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:32,522
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

368
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:47,132
In whose eyes the sun sets

369
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:53,040
The sun sets in whose eyes

370
00:38:53,098 --> 00:39:00,073
The waters of the river Jhelum
Have turned saline

371
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:08,447
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

372
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:16,399
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

373
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:58,739
Who to ask for how much longer

374
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:04,572
This pain we must continue to bear

375
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:12,012
Holding the hand of the blinded night

376
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:17,219
We must walk yet how much longer

377
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:29,335
Blood, blood, blood,
blood has become the colour of time

378
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:35,773
Blood, blood, blood,
blood has become the colour of time

379
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:39,178
Blood, blood, blood

380
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:41,716
Blood is a moulten ember

381
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,514
Blood is a moulten ember

382
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,179
- God! Oh God!

383
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,411
- I'm still alive...

384
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:52,217
- Thank you, Oh Lord! I am still alive!

385
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:43,645
- Gentlemen

386
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:46,376
- Delhi has approved Operation Nightingale.

387
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,812
We have complete support to
arm, fund and run...

388
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,049
the counter insurgency force...

389
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:54,313
- Complete support!

390
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:56,655
The enemy's foes are our friends...

391
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,627
Any individual or group...

392
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,528
anyone with a grudge against...

393
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:05,261
the Hizbul Mujahideen and
Pakistan's proxy war...

394
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:08,133
surrendered militants,
detainees, undenrials...

395
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,066
- will be our primary recruits.

396
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,369
<i>khwan-m-Mukhbireen</i>

397
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:18,076
The Army will run the operation
but your support will be crucial...

398
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,343
in recruitment and intelligence.

399
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:23,479
Let the Nightingale start singing.

400
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,145
It' s catch and kill.

401
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,087
- We need to nourish the Ikhwan

402
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:30,092
<i>khwan-m-Mukhbireen ..</i>

403
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:34,424
With arms, money, power...

404
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:37,794
Isn't that Kau|'s house?

405
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,195
- Yes, he's in Jammu,
in a refugee camp.

406
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:43,602
I think he's moved to Bombay...

407
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:50,741
How many cases do you have?

408
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:53,104
About 75-80.

409
00:42:54,239 --> 00:43:00,087
But why would they take up arms
against their own?

410
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:02,191
For freedom...

411
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:11,463
A prisoner will exchange
anything for his freedom.

412
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,066
Pan/ez...

413
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,161
What...

414
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:18,769
What do we get?

415
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:22,367
Delhi.

416
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,179
Take them away.

417
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:37,187
A dead militant is worth
a hundred thousand rupees.

418
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:39,691
Call the media.
- Yes, sir!

419
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,636
Haider...

420
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:50,137
Hear me out...

421
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:00,714
Who...

422
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,583
Who are you angn/ with?

423
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,217
And why?

424
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,984
He's not just your father,
but my brother too...

425
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,420
my only brother...

426
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,318
It's been...

427
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:17,760
Days since your mother
managed a smile.

428
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,298
She's been crying for weeks.

429
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:27,133
And you accuse us of singing...

430
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:29,337
and dancing in joy...

431
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,208
secretly?

432
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:34,276
She is my brother's wife.

433
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:38,083
My dearest sister-in-law.

434
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:40,385
Haider...

435
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,092
Here, take a look.

436
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,360
I am contesting the elections.

437
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:52,230
Do you know why?

438
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,136
Ask me why?

439
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:59,270
Why?
- For my brother.

440
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:01,042
What else!

441
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,407
Once I'm in power...

442
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:08,417
I'll tear open even] prison
and bring him home.

443
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,613
Uncle, you may wait
for the elections.

444
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:16,519
my battle has already begun.

445
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,762
"Armed Forces Special Powers Act,

446
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,366
Rule 4 of section 5 says -

447
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:31,270
Any person taken under custody under
this Act shall be handed over...

448
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:35,744
to the office in charge of the nearest police
station with the least possible delay.“

449
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:38,705
The least possible delay...

450
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:41,581
It's been twenty days and
there's no word of him.

451
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:46,018
If everything worked by the book...

452
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,318
do you think Kashmir would
have been the hell it is?

453
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:53,058
Pandit Nehru promised Kashmiris
a plebiscite with the world as his witness

454
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,323
What happened?

455
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,021
- Let aside plebiscite...

456
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,327
Even the first condition
to plebiscite...

457
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,263
demilitarization...

458
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,030
did not happen.

459
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:06,737
When two elephants fight...

460
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,706
it is the grass
that is trampled upon.

461
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,469
I agree, uncle...

462
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,742
But I want to file a formal report

463
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:20,623
Don't mess with the army, son.

464
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:24,319
If you file a formal report...

465
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:27,261
the chances of finding him
will become even more bleak.

466
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,593
Rocky is good...

467
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,003
But you are in India...

468
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:38,439
Watch the Indian action hero...

469
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:40,305
Salman Khan...
Tell them...

470
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:43,202
This film was...

471
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:44,776
chutzpah!
- Yes.

472
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:47,216
What is Chutzpah?

473
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,581
It's a big film... a big hit.

474
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:51,278
A blockbuster...

475
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,353
Can I see it?
- Yes, sure.

476
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:55,755
Salman... Salman Khan.
- This guy?

477
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,035
Are you done shooting?

478
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:08,627
I'll eat...
- Come...

479
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,341
Yes please...

480
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:14,642
- Haider...

481
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:17,373
- Eat some more...
- Haider...

482
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,479
- Haider...

483
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:21,517
- I can't see a thing...

484
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,357
Salam Alaikum, uncle.

485
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:32,227
Princess...

486
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:34,260
Where's your prince?

487
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:39,192
Mister...

488
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:42,228
Your mother has been on a
hunger strike for two days now.

489
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:49,676
She won't even touch water till
she she sees you.

490
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,778
Open the door, sis-in-law!

491
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:01,623
I present to you
the sparkle of your eyes...

492
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,091
- your little prince.

493
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,366
My angel...

494
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,474
You know, if you go to Delhi...

495
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:25,514
you'll easily get a job.

496
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:26,979
Where?

497
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:29,011
The National School of Drama.

498
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,012
Please do stop your theatrics now!

499
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:37,083
What do you mean?

500
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:38,686
Why am I to blame?

501
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,320
Emotional blackmail...

502
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:43,556
ever since my childhood...

503
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,992
you would stop eating or leave home.

504
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:50,306
You would cry away
or threaten suicude.

505
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:53,733
That is how you sent me
away to Aligarh.

506
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:55,701
Banished me from my home...

507
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:58,374
away from my father...

508
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,295
If I hadn't pushed you to Aligarh...

509
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:20,167
you know well, where you
would have ended up!

510
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:41,488
What is this?

511
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:46,495
Where did you get this from?

512
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:50,064
I demand an answer.

513
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:52,260
It belongs to a friend.

514
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,132
I'll return it tomorrow.

515
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,469
Ah, now you are friends
with militants?

516
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:03,203
It's a pistol today,
tomorrow it will be a Kalashnikov...

517
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:07,071
Going for arms training in Pakistan?

518
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:08,276
Are you?!

519
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,115
Yes, I'll go across.

520
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:21,029
Sis-in-law...

521
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,224
Are you alright?

522
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,450
- These are dark days.

523
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:45,085
Birds of prey circle above...

524
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:50,081
They prey without care...

525
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:56,194
Kites grab sparrows and
falcons feast on Nightingales...

526
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,460
- Keep him away from it all...

527
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,467
I have a friend
at the university in Aligarh.

528
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,470
Send him there.

529
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:06,370
- Let him see the other side of India.

530
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:11,436
A world without imprisoned days
and curfews at nights.

531
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,040
Doctor Sahib won't let him go.

532
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:18,248
I'll take care of the doctor.

533
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:19,682
- Make Haider come around.

534
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,585
Alright?

535
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:24,317
Now cheer up...

536
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:27,162
Smile, my child!

537
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:34,800
This house is a ruin
without your laughter.

538
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,401
Father...

539
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,633
A bride for Khurram...

540
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:42,639
and it will be a happy home.

541
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,078
He doesn't seem to like any girls.

542
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,148
Why Mr. Khurram?

543
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,449
Well!

544
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,581
All the pretty ones...

545
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,556
are already married...

546
00:51:58,182 --> 00:51:59,718
just like you!

547
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:11,265
You wicked man...

548
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,707
No father wants to see
his son as a militant.

549
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:24,583
But sending him away
is not a way out either...

550
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:30,257
It is a grave problem...

551
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,590
and an old one too.

552
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,198
We have lost a few
generations already...

553
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:45,365
God alone knows when blood
will stop raining on our land.

554
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:48,403
It's all up to India.

555
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:55,373
As they say in India, “birth right“.

556
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,611
And we are only claiming our right...

557
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,587
Freedom.

558
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,155
Freedom...

559
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:13,093
Gandhi won it for India...
not the gun.

560
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:18,172
The gun only knows how to avenge...

561
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:21,065
Commander...

562
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:26,311
revenge does not set you free..

563
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:31,342
True freedom lies beyond violence“.

564
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:39,495
Remember...
Revenge only begets revenge.

565
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:49,730
- Don't you understand?
Can't you hear me?

566
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:52,768
I am not going anywhere.

567
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,532
I am staying here.

568
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,279
With my father.

569
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,621
Jahid.. to the left...

570
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,533
What is it now?

571
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,667
I ask you, one last time...

572
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,446
Will you go or not?

573
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,047
Should I write it down for you?

574
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:35,311
I will not!

575
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:39,747
What is this, mother?!

576
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:41,387
Will you go or not?

577
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:43,788
Please hear me out...

578
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:44,548
- Will you go or not?

579
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:45,719
Put the gun down mother...

580
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,387
Will you go or notl?

581
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,690
Mother, please...

582
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,339
Would you really have
shot yourself that day?

583
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:05,680
Do you doubt me?

584
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,417
No. I'm sure.

585
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,681
You wouldn't have.

586
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:22,223
Was there any other reason
for me to live... besides you?

587
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:28,660
Or is there?

588
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:36,300
I bore those long
painful years for you...

589
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:40,413
Don't...There you go again...

590
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:42,212
You have to listen to me.

591
00:55:45,276 --> 00:55:48,314
Your father never really
cared for me. Our marriage was dead.

592
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:52,625
Which is why he gambled his life...

593
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:54,425
our home...

594
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,165
our honor...

595
00:55:57,221 --> 00:56:00,725
your future... risked it all.

596
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:10,476
Do we have to see everything
through your eyes?

597
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,009
Always?

598
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:19,250
There are other ways of seeing.
Try sometime...

599
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,520
Either way,
you will always blame me...

600
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:37,662
I am used to it.

601
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,507
I know you love your father
more than anyone else...

602
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:53,348
You certainly don't realise...

603
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,753
What I went through
when you were away.

604
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:05,097
Hilaal had lost himself in
the hospital, a saint saving lives.

605
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:13,372
I used to wail like a
hollow bamboo in your memory.

606
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:23,144
I would wait months for you
to return home in the holidays.

607
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:33,153
It is my fate to long... to wait...

608
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:41,669
First for you...

609
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:45,766
Now...

610
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:50,238
And now?

611
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:59,313
The wives of disappeared people
are called 'half-widows' here.

612
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,126
We can only wait.

613
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,527
That is all I can do.

614
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:18,364
Wait.

615
00:58:19,563 --> 00:58:21,065
For father to return?

616
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:23,977
Yes.

617
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:30,042
Or for his corpse.

618
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:37,716
My father is alive!

619
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:40,553
He's alive!

620
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,359
Do you understand?!

621
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:49,501
Please tell me mother, he's alive...

622
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,731
He's alive!

623
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,686
Tell me mother...

624
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,712
he's alive...

625
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:12,221
Please tell me...

626
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,164
Elections are the first step...

627
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,261
on the long road to peace...

628
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:27,241
It is a difficult journey...
but we can see our destination...

629
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,971
Wherever you come from...

630
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,535
people want the same thing...

631
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:34,705
Our schools have been turned
into Army camps...

632
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:37,111
It is not a democracy...

633
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:41,320
it a suffocating system.
A 'suffo-cracy'!

634
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:49,191
The town squares are lined with bunkers
and streets with barbed wires.

635
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,027
According to the APDP there are...

636
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,625
over eight thousand people
who are missing since arrest...

637
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,439
- Your numbers are wrong...

638
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:04,377
What about those three hundred
thousand Kashmiri Pandits...

639
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,142
displaced from their homes,
living as refugees...

640
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:08,774
Will you not count them
amongst the disappeared?

641
01:00:09,006 --> 01:00:12,510
My brother disappeared months back.

642
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:16,183
We have to raise our voices
to search for our own.

643
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:18,055
- What do we want?
- Freedom...

644
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,719
- We'll snatch away...
- Freedom...

645
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,593
And for this I am
running for elections...

646
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:33,105
I would like to remind you
of our neighbor that arms and trains...

647
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:37,202
misguided Kashmiri youth
to kill innocent people...

648
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:43,350
In 1948, they had looted Kashmiri's
when they came as tribals...

649
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:52,149
Raped the women and
killed their children.

650
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:58,232
It was the Indian army that
shed blood to save Kashmir.

651
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,367
- And if we aren't around,
it'll happen again.

652
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,007
Does the law allow you to torture
people you've arrested?

653
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:09,305
The Indian army is one of the most...

654
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:11,744
disciplined armed
forces in the world.

655
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:16,117
We train our officers to interrogate,
and not torture.

656
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:21,518
Amidst militant attacks,
today Kashmir goes to vote.

657
01:01:21,578 --> 01:01:24,650
Militant groups have
exploded bombs in...

658
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:27,456
Srinagar, Barahmulla and Anantnag.

659
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,661
I want you to understand
the ground reality.

660
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,224
Separatists are not demanding
freedom from India...

661
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:38,272
but enslavement to Pakistan.

662
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:42,504
- Indian troops coerced reluctant
voters into polling booths.

663
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:45,069
- India has rubbished these allegations.

664
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:48,082
- However, the voter turnout
remained very low.

665
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:50,709
- Koshmar constituency saw
the lowest turn out...

666
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:53,220
where only 110 votes were registered.

667
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,446
- Congratulations!

668
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:55,615
You have won by a hundred votes.

669
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:57,818
Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

670
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:17,369
These traditional folk entertainers
known as Bhand...

671
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:20,643
are enacting a play
which speaks of a new Kashmir...

672
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:22,477
- A peaceful Kashmir...

673
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:26,009
- will the new regime bring
a brighter future for Kashmir?

674
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,013
Only time will tell.

675
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,648
Nice...

676
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,453
Very nice article.

677
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,224
Thank you.

678
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:16,123
- Come inside...

679
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,765
Come in...

680
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,467
Why are you standing there?

681
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,367
- Why don't you come inside...

682
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:24,733
What has possessed you?

683
01:04:25,762 --> 01:04:27,298
What is wrong with him?

684
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,434
I don't know...

685
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:31,408
These days he just stands
outside the door for hours.

686
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,680
He doesn't come in...

687
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:35,114
- Frisk him.

688
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,584
Where are you coming from?

689
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:44,683
Where are you going?

690
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:46,290
What's in your pockets?

691
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:47,191
Your identity card?

692
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,095
You may go now.

693
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,129
People have become so used to
body searches...

694
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:59,104
that unless they are frisked...

695
01:04:59,162 --> 01:05:02,143
they fear entering their own homes.

696
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:07,480
It's a psychological disorder...
the 'New Disease'...

697
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,150
Are you a doctor?

698
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,282
The doctor's soul.

699
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:42,478
Why are you following me?

700
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,310
What do you want?

701
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:45,618
A message.

702
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,285
What?

703
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,422
A message.

704
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:51,487
I have no message for anyone.

705
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,183
But I do...

706
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,321
A message for Haider,
from his father.

707
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,061
What?

708
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:09,507
A message for Haider shall be
delivered to Haider! Right?

709
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:20,746
Here is my number.

710
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:23,355
I will wait for his call.

711
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,091
What is your name?

712
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:29,295
Rooh...

713
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,428
Roohdaar.

714
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,714
Do we exist or do we not?!

715
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,915
Do we exist or do we not?!

716
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:00,690
Haider...

717
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,024
I have to tell you something...

718
01:07:02,452 --> 01:07:03,863
Listen to me...

719
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:06,431
Haider... Listen to me.

720
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:08,794
There's a message from your father.

721
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,044
Hello...

722
01:07:27,944 --> 01:07:28,684
Hello...

723
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:30,522
Who is it?

724
01:07:31,815 --> 01:07:32,725
I am Haider...

725
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:34,818
Haider who?

726
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:36,590
<i>Haider Meet.</i>

727
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:39,565
Whom do you want?

728
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:41,834
Roohdaar...

729
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,938
Downtown. Zaina Kadal bridge...
Tomorrow, 9 am.

730
01:07:45,996 --> 01:07:47,134
Okay... I...

731
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,696
What's he heading to Downtown for?

732
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:29,875
Salman...

733
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:31,678
TO g0?

734
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:35,113
Or not to go?

735
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:48,888
Where is my father?

736
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,060
In a faraway place...

737
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,433
Very far...

738
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:59,005
You said you had
a message from him...

739
01:09:59,062 --> 01:10:00,837
Yes.

740
01:10:01,598 --> 01:10:02,804
What is it?

741
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,013
Revenge.

742
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:13,944
Vengeance.

743
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:16,415
Vengeance from whom?

744
01:10:17,013 --> 01:10:17,889
And why?

745
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,724
From a murderer...

746
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,726
for a murder.

747
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:30,434
You seem to have confused matters.

748
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:33,633
My father was arrested by the army
and one of these days...

749
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:36,643
we will find out where
they're holding him.

750
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:41,940
Let the petals fill with color...

751
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,417
Let the breeze ruffle the spring...

752
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:09,609
Come along, my love...

753
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:13,705
Awake the garden to life.

754
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:34,393
The prison is a sullen ghost...

755
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:42,570
Ask the breeze for a whiff of hope...

756
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:50,377
Oh, someone please...

757
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:56,482
speak of the beauty of my beloved.

758
01:11:56,546 --> 01:12:02,929
- When fatigue would muffle
our screams in the prison...

759
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:08,133
a sole voice would
rise through the night...

760
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:11,094
a balm to our agony...

761
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:19,475
The lights were never turned off...

762
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:22,016
we craved for the darkness.

763
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:25,548
Lice roamed on our broken bodies...

764
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:27,747
and vengeful snakes in our heads.

765
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,084
MAMA-2 was the other name for hell.

766
01:12:31,114 --> 01:12:34,823
Men returned as from there as mere
shadows of themselves.

767
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:36,090
Officer...

768
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:40,164
How many Area Commanders
do you have in Anantnag?

769
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,497
Where did you get the RDX from?

770
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:46,032
- Aren't you from the Binori mosque?

771
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:49,067
Met Brigadier Badaam?

772
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:52,010
Twenty children died
in your bomb blasts...

773
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:53,979
Do you have any children?

774
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:55,847
No?

775
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,409
You won't father any.

776
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,619
Give me their names!

777
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,828
Sir, I swear I'm a student.

778
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:17,836
I swear, sir...

779
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:20,498
I'm not a militant.

780
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,070
I'm not a militant.

781
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:24,139
Let's hear it all together...
Long live India!

782
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,470
Long live India!

783
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:26,980
- Long live India!
- Long live India!

784
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:29,779
Long live India!

785
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:38,017
Since that day doctor
and I were always together...

786
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,721
like body and soul...

787
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:45,889
We bore our torments together
in the same cell.

788
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:48,694
We were chained together.

789
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,105
It seems we will be
killed together as well.

790
01:13:55,498 --> 01:13:58,570
You can die doctor, but I won't.

791
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,381
And how is that?

792
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,852
You are the body
and I'm the soul...

793
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:08,515
You are mortal and I'm immortal!

794
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:14,793
Are you a Shia or a Sunni?

795
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,365
I am the river and the tree...

796
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:22,699
The Jhelum and the Chinar...

797
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,870
I'm both..
a temple and a mosque...

798
01:14:27,597 --> 01:14:30,100
A Shia and a Sunni, I'm both.

799
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,409
A Hindu as well.

800
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:37,846
I always was... I am...

801
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,754
I will always be...

802
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:47,592
They moved us to other
camps for interrogation.

803
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:52,057
Strange camps... stranger names...

804
01:14:54,357 --> 01:14:57,361
Bo-Bo land, Hotel 6...

805
01:14:57,527 --> 01:14:58,767
Faraz cinema...

806
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:46,852
And one day, there was a revelation.

807
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:52,821
It was Khurram who
betrayed your father.

808
01:15:57,353 --> 01:15:59,526
Khurram had handled
most of the cases of...

809
01:15:59,589 --> 01:16:01,967
militants caught or
surrendered in Kashmir.

810
01:16:02,825 --> 01:16:06,830
With his help Indian Intelligence
played their trump card...

811
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:10,875
forming a militia
to kill militants...

812
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,004
A counter-insurgency force...

813
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:15,005
<i>khwan-m-Mukhbireen</i>

814
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:22,115
The Ikhwans knew
militant sympathisers...

815
01:16:22,378 --> 01:16:24,415
and their modus operandi.

816
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:29,125
- The terror of Ikhwan surpassed The horrors...

817
01:16:29,385 --> 01:16:30,955
Kashmir has seen before.

818
01:16:33,656 --> 01:16:36,694
- It was Khuram who killed your father.

819
01:16:41,998 --> 01:16:46,743
- The army crackdown in your village
was not a matter of chance.

820
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:49,145
- Khurram was the army's informer...

821
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:54,013
- and your mother Ghazala was Khurram's

822
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:58,421
- It is certain. We shall witness...

823
01:16:58,648 --> 01:17:04,064
The promised day...

824
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:09,794
the day of the blessed word...

825
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:14,036
We shall witness...

826
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,878
Roohdaar...

827
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:20,905
Yes.

828
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,914
If you do make it out alive...

829
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:27,548
Convey my message.

830
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:28,850
To whom?

831
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,153
To my son, Haider.

832
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:37,959
Tell him to avenge my betrayal...

833
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,797
by my brother.

834
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:47,168
Tell him to aim his bullets at those
cunning, deceiving eyes...

835
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:52,002
that entrapped his mother...

836
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:58,942
that made him an orphan.

837
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:03,380
And his mother?

838
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:09,395
God will be her judge.

839
01:18:16,926 --> 01:18:20,464
We had become a burden
for everyone...

840
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:25,805
They handed us over
to the Ikhwan.

841
01:18:39,982 --> 01:18:42,656
It was a miracle!

842
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:47,767
The rope that bound us
came loose...

843
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:55,876
The icy water of the Jhelum
stopped my bleeding.

844
01:18:57,032 --> 01:19:01,378
Sand-miners on the
river bank saved me.

845
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:06,478
A few days later, they found
the doctor's body.

846
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:14,427
A little ahead of Baramulla, at Boniyar village
there is a graveyard...

847
01:19:19,455 --> 01:19:25,667
where the unknown dead are buried.

848
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:28,770
They buried your father there...

849
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:30,833
he rests in grave number 318.

850
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:45,119
This is the safety lock.

851
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:48,823
Shoot him at point blank.

852
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:50,728
And remember...

853
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:55,599
aim at the eyes
that entrapped your mother.

854
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:01,938
Those treacherous eyes
that orphaned you.

855
01:21:28,751 --> 01:21:31,163
Father...

856
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:12,365
Who are you calling
so early in the morning?

857
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:14,797
I had a nightmare.

858
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:17,872
What was it about?

859
01:22:27,977 --> 01:22:28,921
Haider?

860
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:33,823
Two days and no word of him.

861
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:38,029
Neither Arshee nor
the Salmans know...

862
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:39,896
My dearest...

863
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:41,900
He's not a child anymore.

864
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:43,970
He'll be back.

865
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:49,874
I bumped into the principal
of your school yesterday.

866
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:53,908
He wanted to know when
you are returning to teach.

867
01:22:55,037 --> 01:22:57,711
The children miss you very much...

868
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:00,780
Once I become whole.

869
01:23:00,843 --> 01:23:02,948
What are you now? Half?

870
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:07,985
I am half-widow and half-bride.

871
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:10,624
You are half a fool as well.

872
01:23:27,036 --> 01:23:28,379
Roohdaar!

873
01:23:33,943 --> 01:23:37,755
- This is the number he called.

874
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:38,950
It is a satellite phone.

875
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,493
It can't be traced.

876
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:49,997
Sir, you had mentioned about
a permanent job for us...

877
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:51,935
another time perhaps...

878
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,677
Miss, your gift is ready...

879
01:24:06,742 --> 01:24:07,982
- Thank you.
- You are welcome...

880
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:24,571
Daddy! is this a snowman?

881
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:25,535
No...

882
01:24:25,828 --> 01:24:27,398
This is your husband.

883
01:24:28,831 --> 01:24:30,469
Do you like his nose?

884
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:32,603
Or shall I cut it a bit?

885
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:37,580
What is that?

886
01:24:39,475 --> 01:24:40,476
A surprise.

887
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:41,911
Oh.

888
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:51,830
Oh... God.

889
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:55,092
When did...

890
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:56,700
When did you weave it?

891
01:24:59,862 --> 01:25:02,342
My sweet child.

892
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:05,638
Here, have one more.

893
01:25:05,701 --> 01:25:07,908
It took a lot to make this for you.

894
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:10,482
No daddy. I'm not hungry.

895
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:15,780
He's not going to return
sooner if you stop eating.

896
01:25:18,013 --> 01:25:20,516
Who brought him the message?

897
01:25:23,686 --> 01:25:24,960
Roohdaar?

898
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:31,694
Open your mouth.

899
01:25:36,699 --> 01:25:39,407
We'll have to take care of Haider...

900
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:42,547
Together.

901
01:25:46,408 --> 01:25:48,888
Don't hide anything from me.

902
01:26:12,868 --> 01:26:13,903
What is going on?

903
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:16,381
A traffic jam at the square...

904
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:40,806
Hello...

905
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:44,909
Hello...
mic testing one, two, three...

906
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:47,137
Can you hear me?

907
01:26:47,403 --> 01:26:48,507
Hello...

908
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:56,048
UN council
resolution number 47 of 1948...

909
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:00,756
article 2 of the Geneva convention
and article 370 of the Indian constitution...

910
01:27:00,983 --> 01:27:02,792
Raises but one question!

911
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:05,621
Haider...
- What?

912
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:07,795
Do we exist or do we not?

913
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:10,836
If we do... then who are we?

914
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,930
If not... then where are we?

915
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:15,638
Did we exist at all?

916
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:16,971
Or not?

917
01:27:17,933 --> 01:27:20,038
Chutzpah is our problem.

918
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:22,480
Do you know what chutzpah means?

919
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:25,115
Once upon a time a bank was robbed.

920
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:26,947
Pointing the gun at the cashier...

921
01:27:27,009 --> 01:27:29,512
the burglar threatened...
give me the money or die..

922
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,558
The cashier gave him all the money.

923
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,827
He went to the next counter...

924
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:39,165
And asked the man to
open an account for him.

925
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:46,172
That is chutzpah...

926
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:49,876
Such audacity, such stupidity.
like AFSPA...

927
01:27:50,532 --> 01:27:53,103
You carry on... I'll fetch him...

928
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:54,073
AFSPA...

929
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:55,771
Attention!

930
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:58,579
Armed Forces Special Powers Act,
section 5, rule 4, point A...

931
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,085
Any commissioned officer...
Yes sir!

932
01:28:00,142 --> 01:28:01,644
Warrant officer...
Yes sir!

933
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:03,087
Non-commissioned officer...
Yes sir!

934
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:06,848
or any other person of equivalent rank
in the armed forces may, in a disturbed area...

935
01:28:06,915 --> 01:28:10,488
if he is of the opinion that it is necessary
so to do for the maintenance of public order...

936
01:28:10,552 --> 01:28:12,998
after giving such due warning as
he may consider necessary...

937
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:16,935
fire upon or otherwise use force,
even to the causing of death...

938
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:25,634
Against anyone acting in
contravention with law or order.

939
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,740
Law and order...

940
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,745
Law and order...

941
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:35,652
Order order...
- Law and order...

942
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:37,449
There is no law,
there is no order.

943
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:38,957
Whose laws? Whose order?

944
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:39,788
Made on order...

945
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:40,724
Law and order...

946
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:44,491
India! Pakistan!
A game on the border.

947
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:46,857
India clings to us..

948
01:28:46,922 --> 01:28:48,424
Pakistan leeches on...

949
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:51,560
What of us? What do we want?

950
01:28:51,627 --> 01:28:52,503
Freedom!

951
01:28:52,561 --> 01:28:54,370
Freedom from this side...
- Freedom!

952
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:55,840
Freedom from that side...
- Freedom!

953
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:57,968
We will be free!
- Freedom!

954
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:00,707
Haider!

955
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:10,652
"A world better than the world,
our |ndia..."

956
01:29:10,712 --> 01:29:12,589
"We are her children..."

957
01:29:12,648 --> 01:29:13,524
Haider...

958
01:29:14,616 --> 01:29:15,117
Yes?

959
01:29:18,053 --> 01:29:19,430
Mother...
- What?

960
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:22,631
Mother...
- Whose?

961
01:29:23,492 --> 01:29:24,061
Yours...

962
01:29:24,126 --> 01:29:26,402
Mine... yes...

963
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:35,074
Mother...

964
01:29:35,137 --> 01:29:36,810
When did you come?

965
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:39,018
Why are you crying?

966
01:29:39,141 --> 01:29:41,087
There's good news for you.

967
01:29:41,443 --> 01:29:42,751
Nobody will call
you a half-widow now...

968
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:45,157
Father is dead.

969
01:29:45,914 --> 01:29:46,949
He is dead.

970
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:51,555
I found his grave.

971
01:29:52,454 --> 01:29:55,765
No more hidden musicals.

972
01:29:58,927 --> 01:30:00,736
You don't believe me, right?

973
01:30:00,796 --> 01:30:02,400
Hang on...

974
01:30:02,464 --> 01:30:03,875
I have a photograph...

975
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,138
My dead father...

976
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:08,643
Mother...

977
01:30:08,837 --> 01:30:10,111
Look at this.

978
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:14,012
Mother...

979
01:30:56,952 --> 01:30:59,023
I couldn't find my brother.

980
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:03,467
But I have found his killer.

981
01:31:06,662 --> 01:31:11,634
He shared his cell at MAMA-2.

982
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:15,013
He goes by the name Roohdaar...

983
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:19,745
No one knows his real name.

984
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:24,117
Even] identity of
his is a ghost identity.

985
01:31:25,047 --> 01:31:27,960
He came from Pakistan in 1990.

986
01:31:28,517 --> 01:31:29,689
An ISI agent.

987
01:31:32,387 --> 01:31:36,529
Two years back, he was
arrested in Baramulla.

988
01:31:37,392 --> 01:31:39,770
He cut a deal with the Indian army...

989
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:44,573
He penetrated Zahoor's group...
A double agent...

990
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:52,751
My brother got to know that.

991
01:31:56,711 --> 01:32:00,557
Which is why he negotiated...

992
01:32:01,483 --> 01:32:04,054
his release as well.

993
01:32:05,954 --> 01:32:07,865
On the way out...

994
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:10,763
he...

995
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:14,534
He... killed him...

996
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:22,144
and pushed him into
the Jhelum river...

997
01:32:22,504 --> 01:32:26,418
These people have killed my brother.

998
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:30,981
Until I avenge his death...

999
01:32:33,615 --> 01:32:35,492
I will not rest...

1000
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:38,090
I promise you...

1001
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:40,394
Haider...

1002
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:46,166
Haider...

1003
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:51,076
Come in, little princess...

1004
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:07,559
Hello.

1005
01:33:08,383 --> 01:33:09,691
Hello.

1006
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,997
What an imbecile you are!

1007
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:15,659
You disappear for days!

1008
01:33:15,724 --> 01:33:17,965
You don't even tell
me when you are back.

1009
01:33:18,393 --> 01:33:20,805
I worn] for you in vain.

1010
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,404
You are so haggard...

1011
01:33:28,637 --> 01:33:31,743
Why don't you find me a cure!

1012
01:37:40,155 --> 01:37:42,761
Everyone doubts you are going mad.

1013
01:37:46,094 --> 01:37:49,075
I trust my doubts but...

1014
01:37:49,397 --> 01:37:51,741
doubt my trusts.

1015
01:37:54,002 --> 01:37:55,379
What do you mean?

1016
01:37:56,004 --> 01:37:56,948
I mean...

1017
01:37:59,474 --> 01:38:02,683
Is Roohdaar the brave,
beloved witness?

1018
01:38:03,111 --> 01:38:06,024
Is Khurram the master of falsehood?

1019
01:38:06,715 --> 01:38:09,025
Whose tells a conceited tale?

1020
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:12,732
Whose bears the cross of truth?

1021
01:38:13,688 --> 01:38:16,100
To believe or not to believe.

1022
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:19,096
That is the question...

1023
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:25,174
The answer hides
in yet another question.

1024
01:38:33,441 --> 01:38:34,419
What is that?

1025
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:42,417
To trust the surging
beats of the heart...

1026
01:38:42,617 --> 01:38:46,429
Or to heed the caution
of sober mind...

1027
01:38:46,621 --> 01:38:49,864
To kill or to die..

1028
01:38:51,559 --> 01:38:54,870
To be or not to be.

1029
01:38:58,032 --> 01:38:59,636
Where did you get this?

1030
01:38:59,901 --> 01:39:00,845
Give it back...

1031
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:02,871
Haider...

1032
01:39:04,739 --> 01:39:06,719
You will do no such thing.

1033
01:39:07,776 --> 01:39:09,756
Whether it's the truth or a lie...

1034
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:15,619
Swear upon me.

1035
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:20,694
I have Iovvedd you more than my life.

1036
01:39:29,097 --> 01:39:31,577
Not Iovvedd, it's loved...

1037
01:39:32,033 --> 01:39:33,740
The V and D softly.

1038
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:35,405
Say it... loved.

1039
01:39:36,671 --> 01:39:37,649
<i>Low e-d.</i>

1040
01:39:38,873 --> 01:39:39,908
Say.. Kicked.

1041
01:39:40,575 --> 01:39:41,053
<i>Kick-Keri .</i>

1042
01:39:41,109 --> 01:39:42,554
Plucked.
- Pluck-ked.

1043
01:39:42,744 --> 01:39:43,552
Sucked...

1044
01:39:43,611 --> 01:39:44,180
<i>Suck-Keri . ....</i>

1045
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:45,014
Fwwf.

1046
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:45,750
Fu...

1047
01:39:49,718 --> 01:39:51,755
'Baster-ed' . . .
- 'Baster-ed' ...

1048
01:40:17,745 --> 01:40:26,028
Thank you for being with us
in this time of grief.

1049
01:40:26,788 --> 01:40:34,036
Somehow I have gathered myself
to bear this bitter loss but...

1050
01:40:34,996 --> 01:40:37,533
the thought of seeing my beloved
sister-in-law live a widow's life...

1051
01:40:37,599 --> 01:40:40,546
and my dearest Haider as an orphan...

1052
01:40:41,068 --> 01:40:44,515
How do I find the courage
to bear that?

1053
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:50,051
And thus facing these facts,
I seek your permission...

1054
01:40:50,111 --> 01:40:53,854
My elders and friends
present here, allow me...

1055
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:59,759
to marry my sister-in-law
Ghazala Meer...

1056
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:03,895
God bless!
- God bless!

1057
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:43,664
Father...

1058
01:41:43,731 --> 01:41:45,870
My father-to-be...

1059
01:41:59,981 --> 01:42:02,791
Go on.. feed this fellow.

1060
01:42:13,761 --> 01:42:15,866
Mother...
- My angel...

1061
01:42:17,966 --> 01:42:20,446
What is this?

1062
01:42:20,735 --> 01:42:23,011
When will you grow up?
- Never...

1063
01:42:23,471 --> 01:42:24,541
What is this?

1064
01:42:28,543 --> 01:42:32,116
Remember what you would say
when you were a child?

1065
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:33,381
What?

1066
01:42:33,681 --> 01:42:36,560
"When I grow up I'm going
to marn/ my mommy."

1067
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:42,465
You would snuggle between
your father and me.

1068
01:42:44,826 --> 01:42:48,797
Even if he touched me,
you would fight with him.

1069
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:52,872
And now his brother touches you...

1070
01:42:54,735 --> 01:42:56,646
What should I do now?

1071
01:43:02,543 --> 01:43:05,752
Who would want to share
you with the world?

1072
01:43:15,423 --> 01:43:17,528
Your beauty is venomous.

1073
01:43:59,867 --> 01:44:05,783
They have given him a pistol...

1074
01:44:06,473 --> 01:44:08,043
to kill uncle Khurram...

1075
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:26,099
- Ghazala Akhtar...

1076
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:31,360
Do you accept Khurram Hussain Meer
as your lawfully married husband?

1077
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,107
I do.

1078
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:41,542
- Do you accept?

1079
01:44:42,843 --> 01:44:43,787
I do.

1080
01:44:43,978 --> 01:44:45,048
- Do you accept?

1081
01:44:46,013 --> 01:44:47,014
I do.

1082
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:51,358
<i>- Khurram Hussein Meet...</i>

1083
01:44:51,419 --> 01:44:56,596
do you accept Ghazala Akhtar
as your lawfully married wife?

1084
01:44:56,657 --> 01:44:57,761
I do.

1085
01:45:14,742 --> 01:45:18,849
O nightingale's heart,
O wounded bird

1086
01:45:18,913 --> 01:45:22,690
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1087
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:27,092
O nightingale's heart,
O wounded bird

1088
01:45:27,555 --> 01:45:31,128
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1089
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:39,969
A head in conflict is in
difficulty indeed

1090
01:45:40,067 --> 01:45:43,139
If the heart is pounding,
the heart is pounding

1091
01:45:44,572 --> 01:45:46,609
If the heart is pounding,
the heart is pounding

1092
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:50,019
Then a pounding head
can be wicked too

1093
01:45:50,811 --> 01:45:54,816
The flower's scent
is filled with poison

1094
01:45:54,982 --> 01:45:57,019
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1095
01:45:57,084 --> 01:45:58,927
O nightingale's heart

1096
01:45:59,387 --> 01:46:01,367
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1097
01:46:01,422 --> 01:46:03,493
O nightingale's heart

1098
01:46:39,793 --> 01:46:43,400
Listen, O world,
I want to speak

1099
01:46:43,931 --> 01:46:46,673
Your story again
I wish to repeat

1100
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:52,417
O nightingale's heart,
O wounded bird

1101
01:46:56,443 --> 01:47:00,585
There was a pair of birds,
A male and female

1102
01:47:00,648 --> 01:47:04,755
The female was innocent,
The male was simple

1103
01:47:04,952 --> 01:47:09,094
There was a pair of birds,
A male and female

1104
01:47:09,157 --> 01:47:13,128
The female was innocent,
The male was simple

1105
01:47:13,728 --> 01:47:17,972
When the mountains
Were covered with snow

1106
01:47:19,834 --> 01:47:22,713
A falcon of bad intention

1107
01:47:24,005 --> 01:47:26,076
A falcon of bad intention

1108
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:30,555
Flew above the trees and forest

1109
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:34,918
Death lurked within its folded wings

1110
01:47:34,982 --> 01:47:38,953
Searching to find
A palace's destination

1111
01:47:39,153 --> 01:47:43,192
Searching to find
A palace's destination

1112
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:04,116
It found a home in
the nightingale's dreams

1113
01:48:04,745 --> 01:48:08,716
And stung them with lethal venom

1114
01:48:08,782 --> 01:48:12,992
Put poison in the scented flowers

1115
01:48:13,053 --> 01:48:17,502
Send to the nightingale in question.

1116
01:48:17,624 --> 01:48:19,831
And stung them with lethal venom

1117
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,806
It found a home in
the nightingale's dreams

1118
01:48:21,862 --> 01:48:23,842
Send to the nightingale in question.

1119
01:48:23,898 --> 01:48:26,071
And stung them with lethal venom

1120
01:48:28,402 --> 01:48:30,404
He sprinkled gun powder in the valley

1121
01:48:30,471 --> 01:48:32,508
Below the lake put snares in sway

1122
01:48:32,573 --> 01:48:36,544
Dangling daggers against the male

1123
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:38,824
Dangling daggers against the male

1124
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,623
Cut the bird's wings away

1125
01:48:42,883 --> 01:48:47,423
O heart, my heart, my heart,
Only cowards lie

1126
01:48:47,554 --> 01:48:51,627
O nightingale's heart,
O wounded bird

1127
01:48:51,992 --> 01:48:57,635
O nightingale's heart,
O wounded bird

1128
01:49:17,685 --> 01:49:24,068
He had the injured man imprisoned

1129
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:31,870
And tied him up like a slave

1130
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:38,540
Took him to the Jhelum bridge

1131
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:45,182
And threw him to a watery grave

1132
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:53,857
Jhelum, Jhelum...

1133
01:49:54,021 --> 01:49:58,094
<i>Red, your amour is red</i>

1134
01:49:58,459 --> 01:50:02,669
Jhelum, Jhelum...

1135
01:50:02,729 --> 01:50:06,802
<i>Red, your amour is red</i>

1136
01:50:10,971 --> 01:50:15,010
But the river's of Kashmir
Have their unique essence

1137
01:50:15,576 --> 01:50:19,615
The chains broke,
As did destiny's tide

1138
01:50:19,746 --> 01:50:23,626
He's alive, he will be living

1139
01:50:23,884 --> 01:50:27,161
The criminal now cannot hide

1140
01:50:28,122 --> 01:50:30,398
He's alive, he will be living

1141
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:32,664
The criminal now cannot hide

1142
01:50:38,933 --> 01:50:47,011
Come to your senses,
lover's nightingale

1143
01:50:47,074 --> 01:50:51,523
The flower's scent
is filled with poison

1144
01:50:51,579 --> 01:50:55,356
Come to your senses,
lover's nightingale

1145
01:50:55,749 --> 01:50:59,856
Come to your senses,
lover's nightingale

1146
01:51:26,714 --> 01:51:28,990
Such a brilliant stow!

1147
01:51:30,084 --> 01:51:31,085
- who wrote This play?

1148
01:51:32,386 --> 01:51:35,424
Zahoor Hussain?
Or was it Roohdaar?

1149
01:51:38,092 --> 01:51:40,595
Didn't they give you a gun too?

1150
01:51:41,996 --> 01:51:43,532
to kill me?

1151
01:51:52,973 --> 01:51:55,749
What shall we do Ghazala?

1152
01:51:56,944 --> 01:51:58,685
Die by his bullet?

1153
01:52:00,514 --> 01:52:01,959
Or have him treated?

1154
01:52:04,818 --> 01:52:06,024
In an asylum.

1155
01:52:07,854 --> 01:52:08,764
Don't let him get away....

1156
01:52:08,822 --> 01:52:09,596
- Haider...

1157
01:52:09,656 --> 01:52:10,498
Catch him...

1158
01:52:10,557 --> 01:52:11,729
- Haider...

1159
01:52:16,763 --> 01:52:19,539
- Follow him... come on...

1160
01:52:40,054 --> 01:52:43,126
It's Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder...

1161
01:52:43,390 --> 01:52:44,664
- PTSD.

1162
01:52:44,725 --> 01:52:47,137
He needs psychiatric care.

1163
01:52:47,594 --> 01:52:49,335
I've had a word at the hospital.

1164
01:52:49,396 --> 01:52:52,104
We'll admit him in the
morning after curfew.

1165
01:52:52,699 --> 01:52:55,839
If he wakes up,
he'll make a run for it.

1166
01:52:56,603 --> 01:52:58,344
I have sedated him well.

1167
01:52:58,405 --> 01:53:00,078
He won't wake up for hours.

1168
01:53:02,909 --> 01:53:06,880
There's a curfew out there,
I'll drop you in my car.

1169
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:09,450
Okay, thank you.
- Come on.

1170
01:53:34,574 --> 01:53:35,450
Arshee...

1171
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:36,985
Arshee...

1172
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:38,714
Open the door...

1173
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:41,655
You misunderstand me.

1174
01:53:42,850 --> 01:53:43,760
No!

1175
01:53:45,519 --> 01:53:47,089
You have betrayed me.

1176
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:49,563
You took advantage of my trust.

1177
01:53:49,623 --> 01:53:50,761
You used me...

1178
01:53:53,093 --> 01:53:56,870
You don't care for Haider's life...

1179
01:53:57,498 --> 01:54:00,069
You want to use him to
catch those people...

1180
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:01,972
who exposed Khurram.

1181
01:54:03,837 --> 01:54:10,516
You don't care if Haider has to die.

1182
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:16,054
Open the door and let me explain...

1183
01:54:16,650 --> 01:54:18,857
Try to see my point

1184
01:54:18,886 --> 01:54:21,628
I don't want to get your point.

1185
01:54:21,655 --> 01:54:24,829
I don't want to see you... ever!

1186
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:06,377
Haider...

1187
01:55:10,437 --> 01:55:12,644
Avenge me...

1188
01:55:14,541 --> 01:55:15,781
of my brother.

1189
01:55:19,513 --> 01:55:23,484
Aim bullets at those
cunning, deceiving eyes...

1190
01:55:24,017 --> 01:55:27,487
that entrapped your mother...

1191
01:55:30,057 --> 01:55:31,866
Don't forget...

1192
01:57:09,089 --> 01:57:10,625
My Lord...

1193
01:57:14,395 --> 01:57:18,502
my crime, my sin stinks...

1194
01:57:22,936 --> 01:57:26,145
- I'm drowning in guilt.

1195
01:57:26,406 --> 01:57:31,754
- My soul reeks of my brother's blood...

1196
01:57:31,812 --> 01:57:34,190
Wash me clean...

1197
01:57:34,448 --> 01:57:37,088
with the rain of your mercy, My Lord!

1198
01:57:41,688 --> 01:57:44,032
Bereave me of all you bestowed...

1199
01:57:48,728 --> 01:57:52,471
All the wealth, all the power,
all the fame...

1200
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:56,581
Everything ...

1201
01:57:57,037 --> 01:58:01,383
- Let The rain of your mercy...

1202
01:58:02,476 --> 01:58:04,956
cleanse me, my Lord!

1203
01:58:17,657 --> 01:58:18,499
Haider...

1204
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:20,695
What are you doing?

1205
01:58:21,995 --> 01:58:23,030
- Haider...

1206
01:58:24,031 --> 01:58:25,169
Give me the pistol...

1207
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:27,470
Do as I say...

1208
01:58:28,168 --> 01:58:29,146
Give me the pistol...

1209
01:58:29,403 --> 01:58:29,938
- Haider...

1210
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:32,541
Grab him...

1211
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:34,712
Hold his hands...

1212
01:58:37,043 --> 01:58:38,545
Show me your hands...

1213
01:58:40,847 --> 01:58:41,757
What are you doing?

1214
01:58:41,815 --> 01:58:42,759
- Let go of him...

1215
01:58:43,884 --> 01:58:44,521
- Let go of him...

1216
01:58:44,584 --> 01:58:47,030
We caught him in time...
or he might have...

1217
01:58:47,087 --> 01:58:50,830
I didn't kill you for
you were in prayer...

1218
01:58:51,057 --> 01:58:55,130
Even a ghastly sinner would enter
heaven if killed in prayer.

1219
01:58:55,762 --> 01:58:58,368
Haider...
you have really gone insane!

1220
01:58:58,398 --> 01:58:59,468
Take him away...

1221
01:58:59,532 --> 01:59:02,741
I will kill you...
when you are in sin...

1222
01:59:02,803 --> 01:59:04,373
not when you are in prayer...

1223
01:59:05,538 --> 01:59:08,109
I'll aim my bullets at
your treacherous eyes, Khurram...

1224
01:59:08,375 --> 01:59:11,481
those deceitful eyes that
entrapped my mother.

1225
01:59:12,012 --> 01:59:14,049
I will aim my bullets
at your treacherous eyes...

1226
01:59:14,114 --> 01:59:17,027
those deceitful eyes that
entrapped my mother...

1227
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:24,500
Move it...

1228
01:59:30,497 --> 01:59:31,407
Step inside.

1229
01:59:42,409 --> 01:59:43,752
Shoot from a distance...

1230
01:59:44,077 --> 01:59:45,818
And shoot him on the back.

1231
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:14,448
Wake-up!

1232
02:00:14,508 --> 02:00:14,952
Wake-up?

1233
02:00:15,008 --> 02:00:15,918
Wake-up you idiot!

1234
02:00:17,577 --> 02:00:18,954
Take out your gun!

1235
02:00:20,547 --> 02:00:21,525
Watch out!

1236
02:00:48,575 --> 02:00:52,079
Haider don't!
We'll do as you say...

1237
02:00:52,546 --> 02:00:54,048
Free my hands.

1238
02:00:54,114 --> 02:00:55,491
Okay.

1239
02:00:57,651 --> 02:00:58,925
It is not my fault...

1240
02:00:58,985 --> 02:00:59,895
He told them everything...

1241
02:01:00,019 --> 02:01:00,963
He's lying!

1242
02:01:01,021 --> 02:01:02,432
He's lying!
It is not my fault...

1243
02:01:02,589 --> 02:01:03,465
It was all his fault...

1244
02:01:03,523 --> 02:01:04,661
Why are you lying?!

1245
02:01:05,826 --> 02:01:06,668
Darn!

1246
02:01:08,528 --> 02:01:09,734
Grab the gun... Quick!

1247
02:01:17,971 --> 02:01:18,881
Want some of this?

1248
02:01:24,744 --> 02:01:25,882
Chutzpah!

1249
02:01:26,045 --> 02:01:26,853
Run...

1250
02:01:30,951 --> 02:01:32,157
Run...

1251
02:01:32,418 --> 02:01:32,953
Run Salman, run!

1252
02:01:36,456 --> 02:01:37,526
Up... Salman!

1253
02:01:38,592 --> 02:01:39,730
Watch out!

1254
02:01:50,737 --> 02:01:51,875
Salman!

1255
02:01:54,374 --> 02:01:56,513
Salman!

1256
02:02:49,629 --> 02:02:50,539
- Hello...

1257
02:02:50,964 --> 02:02:52,102
- Khurram is still alive.

1258
02:02:52,532 --> 02:02:53,875
- But I've killed three cops.

1259
02:02:53,934 --> 02:02:55,470
I heard...

1260
02:02:55,669 --> 02:02:56,670
Where are you now?

1261
02:02:56,736 --> 02:02:58,044
On the Pampore highway.

1262
02:02:58,405 --> 02:02:59,383
Stay on the line.

1263
02:03:00,607 --> 02:03:01,984
It's the doctor's son...

1264
02:03:05,912 --> 02:03:06,947
Send him across the border...

1265
02:03:09,916 --> 02:03:12,055
You'll need go across
the border for training.

1266
02:03:12,919 --> 02:03:15,798
Get to the graveyard
where we met first.

1267
02:03:15,922 --> 02:03:17,401
- We'll get in touch...

1268
02:03:17,724 --> 02:03:18,702
Alright.

1269
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:20,429
Bye.

1270
02:03:34,441 --> 02:03:35,442
Hello.

1271
02:03:36,476 --> 02:03:38,683
Hello...

1272
02:03:49,622 --> 02:03:51,067
Hello Haider...

1273
02:03:55,328 --> 02:03:57,501
Where are you?
In the hospital?

1274
02:03:58,498 --> 02:04:00,569
- Haider...

1275
02:04:01,435 --> 02:04:04,507
There were other ways to pan...

1276
02:04:07,741 --> 02:04:10,347
Why did you have
to get my father killed?

1277
02:04:10,811 --> 02:04:12,654
God!

1278
02:04:14,414 --> 02:04:15,893
This is not true!

1279
02:04:16,649 --> 02:04:18,754
I swear upon God...
this is not true!

1280
02:04:25,458 --> 02:04:26,869
I'm going mother.

1281
02:04:27,928 --> 02:04:28,872
Where?

1282
02:04:32,866 --> 02:04:35,107
You're crossing the border?

1283
02:04:41,474 --> 02:04:44,819
It is a fatal trek..
I won't bear losing you..

1284
02:04:51,852 --> 02:04:55,823
At least, meet me once...
I won't stop you this time.

1285
02:04:55,889 --> 02:04:56,765
I promise...

1286
02:04:57,324 --> 02:04:59,031
- Meet me once.

1287
02:05:02,595 --> 02:05:04,871
Meet me once.

1288
02:05:55,048 --> 02:05:57,085
- My two-faced mother.

1289
02:06:02,722 --> 02:06:08,434
Such innocence in one face;
such deceit in the other...

1290
02:06:08,561 --> 02:06:12,338
We are not to be blamed
for the doctor's death

1291
02:06:14,968 --> 02:06:19,007
Oh! How sad to see a mother lie...

1292
02:06:20,373 --> 02:06:23,445
The flowers on father's grave
were still fresh...

1293
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:25,751
and you rushed into
Khurram's marital bed.

1294
02:06:27,547 --> 02:06:34,522
The world knows you and Khurram
conspired to murder my father.

1295
02:06:34,887 --> 02:06:36,662
These are utter lies...

1296
02:06:41,961 --> 02:06:42,996
Mother...

1297
02:06:44,931 --> 02:06:48,674
Ikhlaq was hiding in our
house that fateful day...

1298
02:06:48,735 --> 02:06:50,772
only you knew that.

1299
02:06:52,472 --> 02:06:56,147
Khurram was an informant
for the army...

1300
02:06:56,376 --> 02:07:00,518
and you were his informer.

1301
02:07:14,727 --> 02:07:15,637
Hello.

1302
02:07:15,729 --> 02:07:18,107
You're home?

1303
02:07:19,866 --> 02:07:21,903
Then what's that shining in the sky?

1304
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:29,620
I'm scared Khurram.

1305
02:07:30,577 --> 02:07:31,180
What happened?

1306
02:07:32,145 --> 02:07:34,819
Hi|aa|'s brought Ikhlaq home today.

1307
02:07:36,416 --> 02:07:37,793
Ikhlaq Latif!

1308
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:43,198
I had no idea that
Khurram was an informant.

1309
02:07:44,991 --> 02:07:48,871
I never wanted to harm
your father.

1310
02:07:51,764 --> 02:07:54,040
I did not hate him.

1311
02:07:59,739 --> 02:08:01,150
And Khurram?

1312
02:08:10,983 --> 02:08:12,985
How did you feel for Khurram?

1313
02:08:31,704 --> 02:08:32,614
Wait...

1314
02:08:32,672 --> 02:08:33,878
Stop the jeep...

1315
02:08:51,958 --> 02:08:54,461
I'll wait eagerly...

1316
02:08:55,428 --> 02:08:57,635
For you to be a widow again.

1317
02:09:00,767 --> 02:09:04,544
My angel, will you do me
one last favor?

1318
02:09:06,572 --> 02:09:08,779
I am tired of my wretched life...

1319
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:15,150
End my agony!

1320
02:09:17,650 --> 02:09:20,096
Your life is your punishment.

1321
02:09:43,810 --> 02:09:46,120
Differentiation is
the unique element...

1322
02:09:46,178 --> 02:09:48,180
It is important to be unique
at something that is...

1323
02:09:48,414 --> 02:09:50,018
valuable to your customers...

1324
02:09:53,486 --> 02:09:55,796
Lakshmi, I told you not to put
any calls through...

1325
02:09:56,422 --> 02:09:56,991
Who?

1326
02:09:58,925 --> 02:10:00,131
Yes, put him through...

1327
02:10:02,028 --> 02:10:02,938
Hello...

1328
02:10:32,558 --> 02:10:34,469
You're equally responsible
for this death...

1329
02:10:38,598 --> 02:10:40,839
Despite everything ...

1330
02:10:41,568 --> 02:10:43,570
you went to see him...

1331
02:10:45,738 --> 02:10:47,649
without telling me...

1332
02:10:48,875 --> 02:10:53,017
Your son has crossed over
to the other side...

1333
02:10:57,717 --> 02:11:00,391
He's become a bloodthirsty animal.

1334
02:11:03,823 --> 02:11:06,736
Yes... but at least
he's not a snake in the grass.

1335
02:12:03,716 --> 02:12:08,631
Where is Haider?
- Liyaqat... calm down.

1336
02:12:08,688 --> 02:12:12,033
Where is he?
- Liyaqat... calm down.

1337
02:12:12,091 --> 02:12:16,096
Wherever he is...
he will not sun/ive.

1338
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:29,818
I won't stop till
I put him in a coffin.

1339
02:13:43,616 --> 02:13:45,960
Both of them had
guns in their hands...

1340
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:50,430
If Haider wouldn't
have fired first...

1341
02:13:50,923 --> 02:13:53,529
Pan/ez would have.

1342
02:14:08,874 --> 02:14:10,945
Everyone wants to kill him.

1343
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:16,651
I know he won't make it

1344
02:14:38,437 --> 02:14:40,474
The doctor's wife on the line.

1345
02:14:44,043 --> 02:14:45,522
Roohdaar...

1346
02:14:45,678 --> 02:14:46,986
- Who is this?

1347
02:14:47,046 --> 02:14:48,457
Ghazala...

1348
02:14:49,081 --> 02:14:50,583
Ghazala Meer...

1349
02:15:05,431 --> 02:15:07,502
Oh, why don't you come...

1350
02:15:07,533 --> 02:15:09,479
My dearly departed ...

1351
02:15:09,535 --> 02:15:11,674
Where you are now...

1352
02:15:11,737 --> 02:15:12,977
Sleep.

1353
02:15:13,906 --> 02:15:15,943
Oh, why don't you come...

1354
02:15:16,008 --> 02:15:17,988
My tired one...

1355
02:15:18,043 --> 02:15:19,920
My life...

1356
02:15:19,979 --> 02:15:21,390
Just sleep.

1357
02:15:22,448 --> 02:15:25,088
Not twilight or sunset...

1358
02:15:26,619 --> 02:15:28,963
Just darkness, only darkness...

1359
02:15:30,789 --> 02:15:32,791
Not twilight or sunset...

1360
02:15:32,859 --> 02:15:34,896
Just darkness, only darkness...

1361
02:15:34,961 --> 02:15:36,702
A nest for your soul...

1362
02:15:36,763 --> 02:15:39,073
So rest, just sleep.

1363
02:15:39,131 --> 02:15:43,807
Oh, why don't you come...

1364
02:15:47,873 --> 02:15:51,980
No one is deep or shallow...
No giants or dwan/es here...

1365
02:15:56,315 --> 02:16:00,764
In the nests of a grave...
Only the deep sleep exists...

1366
02:16:02,521 --> 02:16:05,365
No beds, no breakfast...

1367
02:16:06,559 --> 02:16:08,630
No bags, no baggage...

1368
02:16:08,694 --> 02:16:11,868
Only an angel's lullaby...
So sleep...

1369
02:16:12,832 --> 02:16:17,508
Oh, why don't you come...

1370
02:16:21,373 --> 02:16:25,822
Come home...

1371
02:16:29,048 --> 02:16:31,756
Haider...
Where have you been?

1372
02:16:31,817 --> 02:16:35,959
We have been waiting for you.

1373
02:16:36,022 --> 02:16:39,560
Dig a grave and rest...

1374
02:16:57,410 --> 02:17:00,755
Grandpa, Why do skulls
keep grinning?

1375
02:17:00,813 --> 02:17:02,451
Your skull will surely
be a brooding one.

1376
02:17:02,515 --> 02:17:03,721
Shut up and eat.

1377
02:17:04,116 --> 02:17:07,893
The dead know they never lived fully.

1378
02:17:09,088 --> 02:17:11,432
And it never stops with death...

1379
02:17:11,490 --> 02:17:12,525
Got it?

1380
02:17:14,427 --> 02:17:16,168
The body turns into soil...

1381
02:17:16,428 --> 02:17:19,898
the soil is,
turned into pots and toys...

1382
02:17:19,965 --> 02:17:23,913
You maybe Alexander or Akbar...
Hitler or Gandhi...

1383
02:17:24,103 --> 02:17:25,980
all that remains is dust.

1384
02:17:26,972 --> 02:17:29,919
Who knows... this flask your grandpa
is sewing tea from...

1385
02:17:29,975 --> 02:17:32,581
might be made of some dust
from Alexander's body...

1386
02:17:34,413 --> 02:17:36,916
He may have conquered the world...

1387
02:17:36,982 --> 02:17:40,452
but today he's sewing
tea in a graveyard.

1388
02:18:11,450 --> 02:18:12,758
Whose funeral is it?

1389
02:18:15,754 --> 02:18:16,960
A dead person's...

1390
02:18:17,723 --> 02:18:18,827
Will you have some tea?

1391
02:18:29,134 --> 02:18:30,579
Is it a woman's?

1392
02:18:30,636 --> 02:18:33,583
How does it matter?

1393
02:18:33,605 --> 02:18:35,585
Let's go and eat...

1394
02:18:36,174 --> 02:18:37,414
Come along, son...

1395
02:18:37,710 --> 02:18:38,484
Come along.

1396
02:18:39,879 --> 02:18:41,051
- Haider, come now...

1397
02:18:45,617 --> 02:18:46,561
- Haider!

1398
02:18:49,488 --> 02:18:50,398
Arshee...

1399
02:18:50,956 --> 02:18:51,866
- Haider...

1400
02:18:59,031 --> 02:18:59,736
Haider!

1401
02:19:00,433 --> 02:19:01,036
Haider...

1402
02:19:01,667 --> 02:19:03,943
Stop Haider... don't go there...
Listen to me...

1403
02:19:04,436 --> 02:19:06,507
Haider... don't go there...

1404
02:19:06,572 --> 02:19:08,574
They will kill you...

1405
02:19:08,941 --> 02:19:09,817
Haider...

1406
02:19:12,044 --> 02:19:12,988
Arshee...

1407
02:19:15,848 --> 02:19:16,724
Arshee!

1408
02:19:17,416 --> 02:19:18,451
Arshee!

1409
02:19:18,917 --> 02:19:22,592
Arshee!
- Control yourself...

1410
02:20:49,341 --> 02:20:51,082
- Come what may...

1411
02:20:51,477 --> 02:20:52,956
- the boy should live...

1412
02:20:54,112 --> 02:20:56,558
Get out of there now.

1413
02:20:57,349 --> 02:20:59,420
We have too many
weapons Zahoor...

1414
02:20:59,484 --> 02:21:01,020
they won't fit in the car.

1415
02:21:01,987 --> 02:21:04,126
Take whatever you can. Leave!

1416
02:21:04,389 --> 02:21:05,129
NOW!

1417
02:21:22,007 --> 02:21:25,682
- Zahoor... it is too late.

1418
02:21:43,562 --> 02:21:44,939
- Liyaqat...

1419
02:22:29,374 --> 02:22:30,148
Muzamil!

1420
02:22:31,844 --> 02:22:33,414
There's a whole battalion inside...

1421
02:22:33,778 --> 02:22:34,950
You said he was alone...

1422
02:22:35,013 --> 02:22:36,424
I didn't know, sir...

1423
02:22:39,818 --> 02:22:40,819
Throw a grenade...

1424
02:23:24,095 --> 02:23:25,403
- Brother...

1425
02:23:26,465 --> 02:23:27,671
- Brother...

1426
02:23:57,462 --> 02:24:00,033
- Bring the rocket launcher here!

1427
02:24:13,812 --> 02:24:15,723
- Rocket launcher loaded!

1428
02:24:17,449 --> 02:24:18,393
Fire...

1429
02:24:18,617 --> 02:24:19,755
Fire!

1430
02:24:28,894 --> 02:24:31,807
You were to fire in the middle!
- Muzamil...

1431
02:24:38,670 --> 02:24:40,775
Take the whole darn house down...

1432
02:24:41,139 --> 02:24:42,516
Yes, sir!

1433
02:24:45,744 --> 02:24:46,950
Load up...

1434
02:24:52,484 --> 02:24:53,724
Loaded, sir!

1435
02:25:09,934 --> 02:25:11,675
What are you doing here?

1436
02:25:14,672 --> 02:25:16,913
Please spare my son.

1437
02:25:18,943 --> 02:25:21,719
I'll get him to surrender...

1438
02:25:35,861 --> 02:25:38,842
If you truly love me,
give me one chance.

1439
02:25:52,377 --> 02:25:53,720
- My angel!

1440
02:25:57,048 --> 02:25:58,686
My angel!

1441
02:26:19,337 --> 02:26:20,748
My angel!

1442
02:26:43,862 --> 02:26:47,742
If you got so much as
a scratch as a child...

1443
02:26:48,767 --> 02:26:51,077
I'd tear apart the world...

1444
02:26:52,804 --> 02:26:57,776
You are now covered in blood and...

1445
02:26:59,377 --> 02:27:02,381
I can't do a thing.

1446
02:27:06,918 --> 02:27:09,489
Mother... I won't surrender.

1447
02:27:12,724 --> 02:27:16,137
Don't you want to see me
as a widow again?

1448
02:27:23,969 --> 02:27:25,812
Angel...

1449
02:27:31,543 --> 02:27:34,854
There's no greater pain...

1450
02:27:35,447 --> 02:27:38,189
than to see the corpse
of your child.

1451
02:27:41,019 --> 02:27:42,555
There is...

1452
02:27:45,190 --> 02:27:49,002
To die without avenging
the murder of one's father.

1453
02:28:01,706 --> 02:28:06,121
Revenge begets revenge...

1454
02:28:07,712 --> 02:28:11,592
Revenge does not set us free...

1455
02:28:12,651 --> 02:28:15,825
Freedom lies beyond revenge.

1456
02:28:16,754 --> 02:28:18,563
True freedom.

1457
02:28:26,798 --> 02:28:31,076
I beg you drop your weapons,
surrender... or else...

1458
02:28:33,071 --> 02:28:34,573
Or else?

1459
02:28:37,809 --> 02:28:39,584
You won't live through it?

1460
02:31:53,838 --> 02:31:55,579
- Mother!

1461
02:31:57,609 --> 02:31:58,986
Mother!

1462
02:32:01,112 --> 02:32:02,420
Mother!

1463
02:32:20,531 --> 02:32:21,771
Mother!

1464
02:33:27,932 --> 02:33:28,910
"Haider..."

1465
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:32,538
