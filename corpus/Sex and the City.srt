00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:51,247
CARRIE: <i>Year after year, 20-something</i>
<i>women come to New York City...</i>

2
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,245
<i>... in search of the two L 's:</i>

3
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:57,603
<i>Labels and love.</i>

4
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:02,626
- Yeah.
- He's the best.

5
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:05,818
WOMAN:
Hot dress!

6
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:09,312
<i>Twenty years ago, I was one of them.</i>

7
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:25,486
<i>Having gotten the knack for labels early,</i>
<i>I concentrated on my search for love.</i>

8
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:29,812
<i>Turns out, a knockoff is not as easy to spot</i>
<i>when it comes to love.</i>

9
00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:31,880
What? You're married?

10
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,306
You fucking asshole!
Motherfucker, you're married?

11
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,803
<i>- Until it is.</i>
- I fucking hate you.

12
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:39,400
<i>That is why you need help to spot them.</i>

13
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:41,557
<i>Lots of help.</i>

14
00:01:41,732 --> 00:01:44,749
<i>Help also known as Charlotte York...</i>

15
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,218
<i>... Miranda Hobbes...</i>

16
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:50,811
<i>... and Samantha Jones.</i>

17
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:54,506
- Oh, my God, look at his.
MAN: Hey.

18
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:56,033
Hi, how are you?

19
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,889
Oh, well.

20
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:06,775
<i>My name is Carrie Bradshaw,</i>
<i>and I'm a writer.</i>

21
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:10,743
<i>Year after year,</i>
<i>my single girlfriends were my salvation.</i>

22
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:13,534
<i>And as it turns out, my meal ticket.</i>

23
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:18,755
I've been dating since I was 15.
I'm exhausted. Where is he?

24
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:21,326
<i>Charlotte was looking</i>
<i>for the perfect love.</i>

25
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:24,546
- Trey can't get it up.
<i>- Well, almost perfect.</i>

26
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:26,242
I'm becoming a Jew.

27
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:33,403
We're not barren,
we're reproductively challenged.

28
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:35,797
- They're giving us a baby.
- That's our baby.

29
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:39,360
<i>So Charlotte and Harry journeyed</i>
<i>to China and back...</i>

30
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:41,718
<i>... for their daughter, Lily.</i>

31
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:45,075
<i>Miranda was a disciple of tough love.</i>

32
00:02:45,253 --> 00:02:46,943
Bye. Great sex.

33
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,367
- Steve, I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

34
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:51,565
Carrie.

35
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:54,600
I, Miranda Hobbes,
take you, Steve Brady...

36
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,786
<i>And Miranda journeyed to Brooklyn</i>
<i>for Brady and Steve.</i>

37
00:02:57,964 --> 00:03:00,119
Who wants a Popsicle?

38
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:02,255
Oh, man. Boy.

39
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:05,349
<i>Samantha's love was sex.</i>

40
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:07,037
<i>Lots of sex.</i>

41
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:09,732
I'm dating a guy
with the funkiest-tasting spunk.

42
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:11,236
Can I cancel my rice pudding?

43
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:14,992
<i>And then she found a man</i>
<i>that combined sex and love.</i>

44
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,494
I'm gonna help you be a star.

45
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:19,554
Yes, he is interested...

46
00:03:19,725 --> 00:03:24,943
<i>So Samantha journeyed to Hollywood</i>
<i>with television star Smith Jerrod.</i>

47
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:29,337
<i>As for me,</i>
<i>I was looking for something big.</i>

48
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:31,799
Get in.

49
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,983
<i>Mr. Big. Turns out when that big</i>
<i>love comes along, it's not always easy.</i>

50
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,416
CARRIE:
Just tell me I'm the one.

51
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,709
<i>And despite all the other chapters</i>
<i>of my life...</i>

52
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:46,367
<i>... no one was ever quite</i>
<i>big enough until...</i>

53
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:47,838
Carrie, you're the one.

54
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:50,901
<i>And just like that, I was.</i>

55
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:55,290
<i>Three books and three years later...</i>

56
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:59,217
<i>... we still feel like those four single girls.</i>

57
00:03:59,388 --> 00:04:01,941
<i>And even though time had moved us on...</i>

58
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,668
<i>... I managed to stay exactly where I was:</i>

59
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,995
<i>In love.</i>

60
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:23,970
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

61
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:26,139
I got a good feeling about this one, kid.

62
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,361
Oh, I hope so.
I've always loved this block.

63
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,321
Hi, 3C?

64
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:34,357
<i>Finding the perfect apartment</i>
<i>in New York City...</i>

65
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:38,180
<i>... is like finding the perfect partner.</i>
<i>It can take years.</i>

66
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:42,040
- So how many is this?
- Thirty-three.

67
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:44,367
Lucky 33.

68
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,493
- The worst. I just left you a message.
- And the kitchen's through here.

69
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:55,548
CAROL:
That's the window with the best view.

70
00:04:56,986 --> 00:05:00,968
Thirty-four? Lucky 34?

71
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,463
Well, if anything else opens up,
let us know.

72
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,465
We're very interested in this building.

73
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:10,494
I do have another apartment
that's not even on the market yet.

74
00:05:10,663 --> 00:05:11,921
Care to take a look?

75
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:13,115
- Sure.
- Sure.

76
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,845
All right, then.

77
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:18,244
It's more than you were looking to pay.

78
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:20,707
- How much more?
- More.

79
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,985
So this is where they keep the light.

80
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:34,211
Oh, my God.

81
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:39,243
I have died
and gone to real-estate heaven.

82
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:42,306
Just a simple home for two.

83
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:46,832
And across the rooftop terrace...

84
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:49,256
What, nirvana?

85
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:56,406
Hello. I live here.

86
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:58,739
Your wife has quite a sense of humor.

87
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,998
- They're not married.
- He's my boyfriend.

88
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:05,328
This way.

89
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:10,116
Aren't I a little old
to be introduced as your boyfriend?

90
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:14,114
Point taken. From now on,
you'll be my man-friend.

91
00:06:14,284 --> 00:06:18,004
- That sounds like a dog.
- Well, if the shoe fits...

92
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,570
And this is the master bedroom.

93
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:21,997
Uh.

94
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,424
It's hideous. I hate it. Hurts my eyes.

95
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:31,383
- How is this place even available?
- Nasty divorce.

96
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:34,672
If you live here,
what is there to fight about?

97
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,463
Hm.

98
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:46,286
- Well, now I understand the divorce.
- I can build you a better closet.

99
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:50,718
Welcome home, baby.

100
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:54,876
Can...? Can we afford this?

101
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,732
I got it.

102
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:01,464
BIG:
Okay, let's sign some contracts.

103
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:02,892
"I got it." Just like that.

104
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:06,024
- Like he was picking up a check for coffee.
- It sounds perfect.

105
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,450
Except for the closet,
which Big says he can redo.

106
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:10,244
And he says the kitchen needs work.

107
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:13,742
Of course, I don't know about that
because I keep sweaters in my stove.

108
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:16,033
So he bought it
and you'll live there with him.

109
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:17,501
Yes, together. That's right.

110
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,326
But he'll own it, so
you're keeping your own place, right?

111
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,053
I haven't figured out the details,
but I'm a smart girl.

112
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:25,622
I'll figure out something
that I'm comfortable with.

113
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,878
I just wanna be sure
that you're being smart.

114
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:29,483
And I love you for that.

115
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,203
But for now,
can't you stop worrying for me...

116
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,568
...and just go ahead and feel
what I want you to feel, jealous?

117
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,192
Oh, jealous of me living in this
gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.

118
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:43,190
- All right, I'm jealous.
- Thanks.

119
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,253
You live in real-estate heaven
and I live in Brooklyn.

120
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:49,314
<i>New York</i> magazine said
Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.

121
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,308
Whoever wrote that lives in Brooklyn.

122
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,872
- Hey, there she is. Hey, Hollywood.
- Hey.

123
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:57,499
CARRIE:
Oh, lady. Hi.

124
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,630
- How was your flight?
- Fabulous.

125
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:00,819
- Oh, good.
- Good.

126
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:02,753
- Let's go in. I'm so excited.
CHARLOTTE: Show us.

127
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:09,005
<i>It was a rare occasion that brought</i>
<i>all types of New York women together.</i>

128
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:10,700
Sorry.

129
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:14,994
<i>Blair Elkenn was a waitress</i>
<i>turned model turned actress...</i>

130

00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:23,046
Oh, my God.

133
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:26,547
<i>And now she was getting</i>
<i>the ultimate breakup revenge:</i>

134
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,736
<i>An embarrassing</i>
<i>and very public auction...</i>

135
00:08:28,912 --> 00:08:32,031
<i>... of all the jewelry he had given her</i>
<i>when they were happy.</i>

136
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:35,524
There it is. My baby.

137
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,186
Oh, she's a beauty.

138
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:40,292
When I saw it in the catalog,
I said to Smith:

139
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:44,907
"This flower ring is the essence of me.
One of a kind, filled with fire."

140
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:48,011
- And a little too much.
- Exactly.

141
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,696
Let's go spend some of
my hard-earned Hollywood money.

142
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:54,832
And now Lot 39, the flower ring.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,021
That's it.

144
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:58,920
We'd like to start the bidding

00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,571
Fifteen thousand. At $ 15,000.

147
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:07,642

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,269

- Bitch.

149
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:13,457
The gloves are off.

150
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,186
At $30,000. Now it's against you.
Thirty-five thousand.

151
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:18,789
- I work hard, I deserve this.
AUCTIONEER: At 40,000 now.

152
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:22,449
At 40? Forty thousand?
Forty thousand, thank you.

153
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:25,544
Forty-five thousand. At $45,000.
Now 50,000?

154
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:28,265
Fifty fucking thousand.

155

At $55,000 against you.

156
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:38,256
Would you like to say 60?
Sixty to our colorful bidder? At 60,000?

157
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,476
I draw the line at 50.

158
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,105
I thought this auction would be more fun,
but it's kind of sad.

159
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:47,331
Isn't it?

160
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:50,662
I thought it was just sad for me
because I know her.

161
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,525
But it really is sad, huh?

162
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,084
And it's funny
because they were so happy.

163
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,721
- Yeah, till they weren't.
- I know, right?

164
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:03,172
We all told her to get married
but she didn't wanna listen.

165
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:06,602
He'd been married three times before,
so she let it ride...

166
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,597
...and then she came home one night
and he had locked her out.
