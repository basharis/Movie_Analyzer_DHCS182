1
00:01:32,658 --> 00:01:35,149
News has come from Vienna!

2
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:40,162
"Leopold of Austria has seized King Richard
on his return from the Crusades.

3
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:45,168
Our king is being held prisoner.
Nothing further is known.

4
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:50,674
His Highness Prince John will make
further public pronouncement tomorrow."

5
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:56,547
And how are the dear Saxons
taking the news, Sir Guy?

6
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,684
They're even more worried than Longchamps,
Your Highness.

7
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:03,652
They'll be more than worried when I squeeze
the fat out of their pampered hides.

8
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:07,384
- You intend to act on your plans?
- What better moment than this, Sir Guy?

9
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,224
Whoever would have thought my dear brother
would be so considerate as to get captured...

10
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:16,698
...and leave all of England to my tender care?

11
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:19,167
He may disapprove when he returns,
Your Highness.

12
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:22,501
If he returns.
And I'll see to it that he doesn't.

13
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:28,204
We must drink to this moment, Sir Guy.
Golden days are ahead.

14
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:32,143
I'll assign tax districts to you tomorrow.

15
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,747
Tomorrow, Your Highness.

16
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:48,359
- But who's gonna pay me?
- Pay! Pay!

17
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,434
That's all you Saxons think about.

18
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:55,233
Didn't I tell you it was for Prince John,
who's just come up from London?

19
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,376
Stop! Stop!

20
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,412
This man is freeborn!
He's a landowner.

21
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,520
You can't make a slave of him!

22
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,089
Didn't he refuse to send his men
to work in Guy of Gisbourne's field?

23
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,055
But I protest...!

24
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,455
Dickon, follow me!
The rest remain here.

25
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:17,954
- What's your name, you Saxon dog?
- A better one than yours.

26
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,422
Look to your manners!
This is Sir Guy of Gisbourne.

27
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,255
Sir Guy or the devil!
There's little to choose between them.

28
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,789
- What's your name?
- Much, the miller's son.

29
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,424
- You know it's death to kill the king's deer?
- And death from hunger if I don't.

30
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,164
Thanks to you and the rest of you
Norman cutthroats at Nottingham Castle.

31
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,308
- Be quiet, you.
- I won't be quiet!

32
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:39,569
You can kill me if you like,
but not until I've had my say.

33
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:42,270
You can beat and starve
us Saxons now...

34
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,975
...but when King Richard escapes,
he'll take you by the scruff of the neck...

35
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,347
...and fling you into the sea!

36
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,598
- What the devil?
- Come now, Sir Guy.

37
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,703
- You'd not kill a man for telling the truth?
- lf it amused me, yes.

38
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,973
Be thankful my humor's of a different sort.

39
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,509
- By what right do you interfere with justice?
- By a better right than you have to misuse it.

40
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,646
That goes for your master, Prince John.

41
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,715
I'll give him that message at
the baron's meeting in Nottingham tonight.

42
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:21,011
Thank you.
He does need a bit of a talking to.

43
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,815
- Eh, Will?
- Yes, he has been getting rather out of hand.

44
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,148
- Fetch him along.
- Hold there. What's his fault?

45
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,294
- He's killed a royal deer.
- You're wrong. I killed that deer.

46
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,793
This man's my servant.

47
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,394
I suppose you realize the penalty
for killing the king's deer is death.

48
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,969
- Whether for serf or noble.
- Really?

49
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,538
Are there no exceptions?

50
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,221
- Thanks, good master.
- Better look before you shoot next time.

51
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:03,124
From this day, I follow only you. There
isn't a poor Saxon in Nottingham shire...

52
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,856
...that doesn't know and bless
Sir Robin of Locksley.

53
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,659
Take me as your servant.

54
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:11,096
Why, in all the forest,
there isn't a hunter as good as me.

55
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,433
I ask no pay.
Just to follow you.

56
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,700
Fetch the deer, then.

57
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,156
While Richard is bent on adventure
in foreign lands...

58
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,885
...it is our duty as Normans
to preserve the realm...

59
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:14,055
...by giving loyal support to Prince John,
the only true defender of the Norman spirit.

60
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,793
Hail to Prince John.

61
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:31,749
My lords, I thank you.
Well, this is what we Normans like:

62
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:37,355
Good food, good company, and a beautiful
woman to flatter me, eh, Lady Marian?

63
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,751
Was it worthwhile coming with me
from London...

64
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:42,485
...to see what stout fellows
our Nottingham friends are?

65
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:47,325
Take Sir Guy of Gisbourne, now. One of our
most renowned defenders of the realm.

66
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,095
- Must I take him, Your Highness?
- Why, you like him, don't you?

67
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,969
- Well, he's a Norman, of course.
- Is that the only reason for liking him?

68
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,373
Isn't that reason enough for a royal ward
who must obey her guardian?

69
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,945
Oh, nay, I'd not force you, my lady.

70
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:06,915
But he's our most powerful friend in these
shires and he's already in love with you.

71
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:12,456
If I could promise him marriage
to a royal ward, it might help my plans.

72
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,219
- Perhaps when I know him better.
- Of course.

73
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,988
You're a very wise young woman.

74
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,998
Any more objections to the new tax
from our Saxon friends?

75
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,567
Objections, Your Highness?

76
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:27,900
With a Saxon dangling from every
gallows tree between here and Charnwood?

77
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:30,633
Well said, sir knight.
But not too many, mind.

78
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,076
Else we'll have nobody left
to till our land or pay the tax.

79
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,909
There's one exception I'd make,
Your Highness.

80
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,517
- A certain Saxon noble.
- Who is that?

81
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:46,215
- Sir Robin of Locksley.
- Sir Rob... Sir Robin of Locksley?

82
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:50,419
Why, I've heard precious little else since
I've been here. What's his latest outrage?

83
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,896
Oh, nothing less than killing a royal deer
in Sherwood Forest today.

84
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,731
And you didn't take him?

85
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,028
That would have been a problem,
Your Highness.

86
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,404
- A Saxon a problem?
- He's a notorious troublemaker, my lady.

87
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,545
Aye.
An impudent, reckless rogue...

88
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,977
...who goes around the shire
stirring up the Saxons against authority.

89
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,845
And he has the insolence to set himself up
as a protector of the people.

90
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:17,580
- I could have captured him long ago, but...
- But what?

91
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:21,214
Well, he's the deadliest archer
in England, and...

92
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:25,989
And my brave High Sheriff of Nottingham
is afraid of him.

93
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:30,192
I want him taken and hanged. At once,
do you hear? I'll not tolerate...

94
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,902
Open the door!

95
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,214
Who is this, this...?

96
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,984
Sir Robin of Locksley, Your Highness.

97
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,792
Let him approach.

98
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,642
Greetings, Your Highness.

99
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,275
You should teach Gisbourne hospitality.

100
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:22,113
I no sooner enter his castle doors
with a piece of meat...

101
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,086
...than his starving servants
try to snatch it from me.

102
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,283
You should feed them, Gisbourne.
They'll work better.

103
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:32,053
With the compliments of your royal brother,
King Richard, God bless him!

104
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:36,159
By my faith, but you're a bold rascal.

105
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,327
Robin, I like you.

106
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,267
I'm gratified, Your Highness.

107
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't think Gisbourne shares
that sentiment, however.

108
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:46,105
He does look sour.

109
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,045
What's the matter, Gisbourne?
Run out of hangings?

110
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:51,842
- I know a ripe subject for one.
- lf you'll excuse me...

111
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:54,485
Sit down! Sit down, my dear.
He'll not harm you.

112
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:57,679
Sir Robin, this is the Lady Marian Fitzwalter.

113
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,585
I hope my lady had a pleasant journey
from London?

114
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,955
What you hope can hardly be important.

115
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,889
What a pity her manners
don't match her looks, Your Highness.

116
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,802
You hear that, gentlemen?

117
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,235
Here's Gisbourne so in love with Marian
he daren't say "boo" to her...

118
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:17,705
...and this saucy fellow
gives her better than she sends.

119
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:22,745
My lords and ladies, I would like to present
to you Sir Robin of Locksley.

120
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:30,116
Sir Robin, permit me to present to you
your host, Sir Guy of Gisbourne...

121
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:34,248
...and our noble guests.
- I'm deeply honored, Your Highness.

122
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,553
- Have you had meat?
- None but what I brought.

123
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,788
Well, sit down.
Sit down there opposite me.

124
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:42,331
- Get up, Sir lvor, and give him your place.
- Your Highness!

125
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,162
Get up!
Get up, sir knight!

126
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,902
Come, Sir lvor.
Out with you.

127
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:50,064
Bring Sir Robin food at once,
do you hear?

128
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,575
Such impudence must support
a mighty appetite.

129
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,111
True enough, Your Highness.

130
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,876
We Saxons have little to fatten on
by the time your tax gatherers are through.

131
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:03,313
Be seated, gentlemen. No need
to stand on ceremony on my account.

132
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,724
So you think you're overtaxed, eh?

133
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,385
Overtaxed, overworked and paid off
with a knife, a club or a rope.

134
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:14,464
- Why, you speak treason.
- Fluently.

135
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,033
I advise you to curb
that wagging tongue of yours!

136
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,930
It's a habit I've never formed.

137
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:23,302
You know, we Saxons aren't going to
put up with these oppressions much longer.

138
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:26,638
Oh, you're not?
Then listen to this:

139
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:31,041
As you may know, my brother
is a prisoner of Leopold of Austria.

140
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:37,451
And from Leopold, I have received
a ransom demand of 150,000 gold marks.

141
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,319
That means that you, my friends...

142
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:44,656
...must collect in taxes not 2 gold marks
in the pound, but 3!

143
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,960
- And the money's to be turned over to me.
- Why to you, Your Highness?

144
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:53,537
- King Richard appointed Longchamps regent.
- I've kicked Longchamps out.

145
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,142
From now on, I am regent of England.

146
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,139
Well, confound it,
what are you goggling at?

147
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:07,046
Is it so strange that I decide to rule
when my brother's a prisoner?

148
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,686
Who's to say I shouldn't?

149
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:12,449
- You, Sir Mortimer of Leeds?
- Not I, Your Highness.

150
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,684
- You, Sir Boron?
- Nor I, Your Highness.

151
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,958
- You, Sir Ralf of Durham?
- My sword is yours, Your Highness.

152
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:23,757
And what about our young
Saxon cockerel here?

153
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,536
What's the matter?
Have you no stomach for honest meat?

154
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,706
For honest meat, yes.
But I've no stomach for traitors.

155
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:37,213
- You call me traitor?
- You? Yes.

156
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:39,782
And every man here
who offers you allegiance.

157
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,985
Your Highness.

158
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,186
What do you call a man who takes advantage
of a king's misfortune...

159
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,624
...to seize his power?

160
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,789
And now, with the help
of this sweet band of cutthroats...

161
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,767
...you'll try to grind a ransom for him
out of every helpless Saxon.

162
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:04,239
A ransom that'll be used not to release
Richard, but to buy your way to the throne.

163
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,235
Let me ram those words down his throat,
Your Highness!

164
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:12,406
Oh, no. Later.
Let him spout for the moment.

165
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:16,076
And what do you propose to do?

166
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:23,424
I'll organize revolt.
Exact a death for a death.

167
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:27,395
And I'll never rest until every Saxon
in this shire can stand up, free men...

168
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,591
...and strike a blow for Richard and England.

169
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,430
- Have you finished?
- I'm only just beginning.

170
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:36,062
From this night on, I use every means
in my power to fight you.

171
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,438
Dickon!

172
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,739
Such impudence, Your Highness.
If I could only reach him.

173
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,471
Stand back!
Stand back!

174
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,977
Open the door!

175
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,174
Quick, guards, quick!
There's a traitor inside trying to escape!

176
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:28,114
- Shut the door, quick!
- Traitor, sir?

177
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,074
You infernal idiot!
Which way did he go?

178
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,505
There, through the gate.

179
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,505
- After him!
- Guards! Horses!

180
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,515
Dickon, follow Mansfield!
To your troop!

181
00:18:58,336 --> 00:18:59,963
Up you go, quick.

182
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,166
Find Crippen
the arrow-maker and his friends...

183
00:19:03,341 --> 00:19:06,310
...to pass the word to every man
who's been beaten or tortured:

184
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,946
- The Gallows Oaks in Sherwood tomorrow.
- Yes, master.

185
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,479
Off you go, and good luck.

186
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:35,936
Have it proclaimed in every village
that this Saxon Locksley's an outlaw.

187
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,009
- Hang anybody that gives him shelter or aid.
- Yes, Your Highness.

188
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:43,477
His possessions are forfeit to the crown.
Seize his castle and his lands.

189
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:46,014
Everything he owns.

190
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,978
And just to let the people know
how the wind has changed...

191
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:54,717
...the sooner you begin collecting the...
- The ransom, Your Highness?

192
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:00,161
Yes, yes, of course.
The ransom.

193
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,401
There's a death sentence
for your Robin of Locksley!

194
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,304
I'll have him dangling in a week.

195
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,449
- I'm tired.
- What?

196
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,852
- After a refreshing sleep in the greenwood?
- I've pulled seven acorns out of my ribs.

197
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,993
- Lovely fresh air.
- My teeth ache with chattering.

198
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,653
- Nightingales singing.
- An owl hooting in my ear all night.

199
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,857
Hooting?
He was singing you to sleep.

200
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,674
There's a lusty infant.
He'd be a good one to reason into joining us.

201
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,149
By the look of him,
his quarterstaff does his reasoning for him.

202
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,222
- Let's see what he's made of.
- It's your skull, not mine.

203
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,393
- Give way, little man.
- Only to a better man than myself.

204
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,300
He stands before you.

205
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,974
Let him pass, Robin. It's much too warm
to brawl with such a windbag.

206
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,908
When I've brushed this fly off,
I'll give you a dusting for good measure.

207
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,343
This fly has a mighty sting, friend.

208
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:27,245
I've only a staff and you threaten me
with a longbow and a goose shaft.

209
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,685
- Aren't you man enough...?
- Wait! I'll get myself a staff.

210
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,301
- Ready?
- Yes.

211
00:21:57,882 --> 00:22:01,511
Hey, pretty fellow, play a livelier tune
that I can make this puny rascal dance to.

212
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,857
You need a merrier tune?
Well, how's this?

213
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,632
If you want a lesson,
you came to the right man!

214
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,896
- Where is he?
- Who?

215
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:24,005
- This quarterstaff master.
- Here.

216
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:25,733
Give my compliments to him.

217
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:30,471
My friend, I should ask payment
for what I'm teaching you here today.

218
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,517
There's something on account.

219
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,352
There's your change.

220
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,714
My head hums like a swarm of bees.
What's your name, friend?

221
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,080
- John Little. What's yours?
- Robin.

222
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,346
- Not Robin of Locksley?
- Aye.

223
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:14,390
- Then I'm right glad I fell in with you.
- 'Twas he who did the falling in.

224
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:19,954
I wanted to see what you were made of.
And I did.

225
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,958
- I hope you'll not hold it against me.
- On the contrary.

226
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:26,069
- I love a man that can best me.
- I'd like to join your company.

227
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:31,368
You shall. If you can hold a breach like you
held that bridge, you're one of us. Welcome.

228
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,738
- This is Will of Gamwell.
- Yeah.

229
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:37,473
- He took good care not to wet his feathers.
- Just brain over brawn, friend.

230
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:43,147
You heard Robin's orders.
Look nippy now and spread the word.

231
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,723
"By royal decree, Robin of Locksley is
declared an outlaw, condemned to death."

232
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:55,389
- Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.
- "Any person aiding him will be hanged."

233
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,728
Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.

234
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,301
Robin in Sherwood.

235
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,134
At the Gallows Oak.

236
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,400
Robin in Sherwood.

237
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,908
Robin. Gallows Oak.

238
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,015
Gallows Oak.

239
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,287
I've called you here as freeborn Englishmen,
loyal to our king.

240
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,651
While he reigned over us we lived in peace.

241
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:23,089
But since Prince John has seized
the regency...

242
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,560
...Guy of Gisbourne and his traitors
have murdered and pillaged.

243
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:30,326
You've all suffered from their cruelty.
The ear loppings, the beatings...

244
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,403
...the blindings with hot irons,
the burning of our homes...

245
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:36,631
...the mistreatment of our women.
It's time we put an end to this!

246
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,368
- Robin's right.
- Aye!

247
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:41,343
Now, this forest is wide.

248
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,277
It can shelter, clothe and feed
a band of good, determined men...

249
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,883
...good swordsmen, good archers,
good fighters!

250
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:51,454
Men, if you're willing to fight for our people,
I want you. Are you with me?

251
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,147
Aye! Aye!

252
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,218
Then kneel and swear this oath.

253
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:03,865
That you, the freemen of this forest, swear
to despoil the rich only to give to the poor.

254
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:09,302
To shelter the old and helpless, to protect
all women, rich or poor, Norman or Saxon.

255
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,465
Swear to fight for a free England.

256
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:15,943
To protect her loyally until the return of our
king and sovereign, Richard the Lion-Heart.

257
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,639
And swear to fight to the death
against our oppressors!

258
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,752
We do!
We do solemnly swear!

259
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,265
String him up again!

260
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,844
- He'll die if we lash him again, my lord.
- Oh, he'll die, will he?

261
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:52,540
Another one of their Saxon impudences.
They'll do anything to trick us.

262
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,446
Continue!

263
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:06,255
- Mercy, good master! Have mercy!
- Start him dancing!

264
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,742
This will teach you to defy Prince John!

265
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,612
Father! Father!

266
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,085
Stop!

267
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:46,894
Five men dead. Murdered.
Sir lvor, Nigel, Baldwin, Norbert.

268
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:49,505
- You don't have to name them.
- Our men can't lay a hot iron...

269
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:53,440
...in the eyes of a tax dodger without getting
an arrow in the throat. It's an outrage!

270
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,977
- He's got to be stopped!
- Have you tried to stop him?

271
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,272
Yes, but I couldn't find him.

272
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,853
What chance has anyone of finding him?
Every villager and woodcutter's his friend.

273
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,991
Every runaway serf and Saxon thief
in the shire is joining him.

274
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,093
I've sent spies in the forest
to find out his hiding place...

275
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:14,755
...but he strikes, and gone like a flash.
- While you stay safely at home.

276
00:27:15,466 --> 00:27:18,560
Do you question my valor?
Am I not personally commanding the force...

277
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:21,364
...that goes with Sir Guy and Lady Marian
to Kenworth Castle...

278
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,599
...to guard the tax money he is bringing back,
with my sword and my life?

279
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:28,303
I only hope this murderer
does come out of his hiding place.

280
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,844
You hope!

281
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:36,981
Enough of this wrangling! I'll lay this outlaw
by the heels when I get back.

282
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:09,515
Well, well.
A curtal friar, and a mighty fat one at that.

283
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,349
- He's the man we need. I'll enlist him.
- Be careful, Robin.

284
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:14,753
That's the friar of Fountain's Abbey.
He's noted...

285
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,895
Yeah, that's right.
Noted for his piety.

286
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:21,259
A humble soul, he is,
with a heart as gentle as a lamb.

287
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:24,196
- Be easy with him, master.
- Oh, I won't harm him.

288
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,135
You stay here lest you frighten him.
Don't interfere.

289
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:31,937
But that friar's one of the most
dangerous swordsmen...

290
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,349
Bless my soul, a miracle!

291
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,930
Robber! Thief!
Give me back my mutton joint!

292
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:38,837
If you're a robber you'll get nothing from me.
I'm a curtal friar and vowed to poverty.

293
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,677
If this is poverty,
I'll gladly share it with you.

294
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,838
That's what you are doing.
Give me back my mutton joint!

295
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,746
Not so close, my ponderous one.

296
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,978
- I'd have a word with you.
- Well?

297
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:54,454
I live in the forest with good fellows who've
everything in life save spiritual guidance.

298
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:55,990
And no merit but one.

299
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,492
- And what's that?
- We're outlaws.

300
00:29:58,996 --> 00:30:02,591
Since we're newborn to the greenwood,
we need someone to do our christenings.

301
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,736
- So we've chosen you.
- Not I.

302
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:10,863
- They've probably all got your taking ways.
- Of course. But you'll love them, one and all.

303
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,541
Now, friar, let's waste no more time.
We'll take the shortcut across the stream.

304
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:18,538
- Come.
- I'll not. I'm happy here.

305
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,775
You will come.

306
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,147
Now then, since I don't care to get my feet
wet, you'll carry me across on your back.

307
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,452
- On my back?
- Bend! You must learn obedience.

308
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,060
Come on, bend.

309
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,404
On, now!

310
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:52,674
Come on! On! On! Faster!
I'll have a gallop from you yet.

311
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:20,936
Come now, fat one. Why don't you give up?
You can see I'm a better swordsman.

312
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:25,939
After I let a little air into your bellows
you'll whistle a different tune.

313
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,148
By Our Lady,
you're the fairest swordsman I ever met.

314
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,150
Must we go on, then?
I think we're even now, friar.

315
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,153
Even? Nay. You're still ahead of me
by half a leg of mutton.

316
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,814
- So...
- No. Hold there, friar. Enough.

317
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:12,486
Come with me and I'll promise you the finest
venison pasty, and the biggest you ever ate.

318
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:17,100
Beef, boar's head, casks of ale.

319
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,499
If you'd said that before, you'd have saved
us both a wetting. Come along.

320
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:24,038
- You'll join us?
- Aye.

321
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,905
If only to convert you
from your thieving ways.

322
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,782
You're Robin Hood, aren't you?

323
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:34,611
The holy henchman!

324
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:37,618
Hail, doubting friar!

325
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:39,950
- Robin.
- Aye?

326
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,421
He's well named Friar Tuck.

327
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:45,323
It would take half the deer
in Sherwood Forest to fill that cavern.

328
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:49,428
And twice that to fill your empty head.

329
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:56,506
- Whoa, Will!
- What news, Will?

330
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:59,438
- I've got word...
- It's all right. He's one of us.

331
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,340
One of us?
He looks like three of us.

332
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,981
Aye.
And equal to a full dozen.

333
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:09,148
Now, now, now, now.
Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett. What's it, Will?

334
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,118
Sir Guy of Gisbourne
is stopping by the way tonight.

335
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,053
- Has he got the tax money?
- A fortune!

336
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,557
- When does he enter Sherwood?
- Tomorrow.

337
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:20,629
We'll have to postpone that stuffing match
I promised, but it'll be double tomorrow!

338
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,029
Come! Back to camp, men!
Here, curb your appetite with that.

339
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,015
- Are you ready, men?
- Aye.

340
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,511
- See anything of them?
- Not yet.

341
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:13,810
Is everything ready?

342
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,386
They'll think they've got into
a blooming hornet's nest.

343
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:23,120
There they come.

344
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:46,147
- Hadn't we better send out flanking guards?
- What for?

345
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,478
Well, this is Sherwood, you know,
and Robin Hood...

346
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:52,679
- Afraid of that gallows-face?
- Afraid? Certainly not, sir.

347
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,755
But it's here that he's boldest.

348
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:59,555
Don't worry.
We're more than enough to take care of him.

349
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,631
Outlaws have no face to show themselves
against armed troops.

350
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,200
Are you sure?
I seem to remember...

351
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,271
Oh, yes, he jumps out of ambush at small
parties, but he wouldn't dare to attack us.

352
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,399
- Well, you old rooster, what do you see?
- Make ready. They're in two sections.

353
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:15,807
- Do you see Sir Guy?
- He's leading the second.

354
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,537
The treasure wagon is with him.

355
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,538
Sir Guy and the sheriff
are watering their horses.

356
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,201
- The advance guard's far ahead.
- Good. Little John!

357
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,872
Take your men and cut off the first section.
You surround the advance guard.

358
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,574
Personally!

359
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,720
- Ready, men?
- Aye, Robin!

360
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:02,825
Then stand ready for the signal.
Come, Will. Come on, let's welcome Sir Guy.

361
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,284
- Look!
- The guard! Quick!

362
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,265
Welcome to Sherwood, my lady.

363
00:37:56,907 --> 00:38:00,001
What, Sir Guy, no greeting from you?
Why, that's curious.

364
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:03,977
I've often heard that you'd give me a warm
welcome if ever we met again.

365
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:08,007
- You're permitting this insolence without...?
- Fighting?

366
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:12,144
- I'm afraid he has no choice, my lady.
- Well, I have, you impudent rascal!

367
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,985
You're not going to harm my lamb,
my honeysuckle.

368
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,456
Be still, Bess.

369
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,289
We've nothing but peaceful intentions.
Have we, men?

370
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,193
We only want to stroke his pretty neck.

371
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,460
- We won't harm him much.
- You see?

372
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,763
Well, let's away.

373
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,655
Don't bother to mark the way.
It'll take keener men than you've got...

374
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,728
...to find our camp again.
- You'll hang for this, all of you.

375
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:55,922
A small price to pay for the company
of such a charming lady.

376
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,695
What can a Saxon hedge-robber
know of charm? Or ladies?

377
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,065
- She means you.
- Me? A hedge-robber?

378
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,299
You must tell me more about myself.
You may have been misinformed.

379
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,639
Perhaps, but I don't find it interesting
enough to bother about.

380
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,616
You just harm one hair
of my lady's head...

381
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:19,017
...and that ugly face of yours will walk
about with no neck under it. Now, mind!

382
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:22,056
- What are you staring at?
- I ain't never been out walking...

383
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,285
...with a female before.
- What female?

384
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:28,261
- You.
- Well, of all the impudence!

385
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,195
I suppose you say that to all women
that tickle your fancy.

386
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:33,802
I've never tickled
a woman's fancy before.

387
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,939
No, I've never had a sweetheart.

388
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:41,643
Do you mean to say you never had one single
sweetheart in all your life?

389
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,371
You don't know what you missed,
my lad.

390
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,847
I've had the bands on five times.

391
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,103
My lord! Your robes for the feast.
Hurry up, put them on.

392
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,971
- I won't!
- You will!

393
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:15,475
I will! I will!

394
00:40:25,155 --> 00:40:26,622
To them, this is heaven.

395
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:31,625
Silks for rags, kindness instead of riches,
limitless food instead of hunger.

396
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:34,662
- Why, they're actually happy.
- Are they?

397
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,995
Aren't you even a little pleased
to see them enjoying themselves?

398
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:40,102
I think it's revolting.

399
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:45,900
Your life's been very sheltered, hasn't it,
my lady? Too sheltered, perhaps.

400
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:51,742
But if you could know these people as I know
them. Their patience, loyalty, goodness.

401
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,648
Friar Tuck!
These should fit Sir Guy.

402
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:06,453
Me lord. Here is your raiment
for the banquet.

403
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,929
When you've done with them,
give them to Prince John.

404
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:14,500
To the tables, everybody,
and stuff yourselves!

405
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,235
May I serve you, my lady?

406
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,813
I'm afraid the company
has spoiled my appetite.

407
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,349
Misfortune.
Now, mine is excellent.

408
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,562
- A little mutton, my lady?
- I said I'm not hungry.

409
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,536
Why, so you did. I'd forgotten.

410
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:55,076
Well, you will let me know
if you regain your appetite, won't you?

411
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,509
Friends! Friends!

412
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:35,482
I'd supposed, with you, that this Sir Guy
of Gisbourne was a scurvy fellow...

413
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:37,984
...and a bitter enemy of ours.
And yet, look!

414
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,214
He provides us with this tasty supper.

415
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:48,090
And is this the end of his beneficence?
Why, no!

416
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:53,601
For in his train today he's brought us half
a score of boxes full of jewels and silks...

417
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:58,969
...and more, about 30,000 golden marks
wrested from the northern shires.

418
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,109
- You wouldn't dare.
- Sit down!

419
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:09,250
Some of you might think our host intended
this treasure for the coffers of Prince John...

420
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:12,320
...instead of to ransom the king.
And you would be right.

421
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,548
But a strange thing happened.

422
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:20,391
A change of heart overtook him in the forest,
and there it is, safe and sound!

423
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,429
- You speak of loyalty.
- Yes. Why not?

424
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:32,302
I suppose you and your cutthroats
intend to send this treasure to Richard?

425
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,411
You wouldn't dream
of keeping it yourselves.

426
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:41,484
Friends! What shall we do with this treasure?
Divide it amongst ourselves?

427
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,246
- Hold it for Richard!
- It belongs to the king!

428
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,827
- Convinced?
- I may have been hasty...

429
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:02,996
But why you, a knight, should live here
like an animal, robbing, killing, outlawed...?

430
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,937
Are you really interested in learning
why I turned outlaw?

431
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,668
Or are you afraid of the truth?
Or of me, perhaps?

432
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:14,378
- I'm afraid of nothing. Least of all of you.
- Good. Then come with me.

433
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,644
Oh, so you are afraid.

434
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:31,458
- Well, men.
- Hi!

435
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:49,578
Hardly an inspiring sight
for such pretty eyes as yours, I'm sure.

436
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,053
But these poor devils
have all had their homes burned.

437
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:56,522
Their families beaten and starved to death
by your tax gatherers.

438
00:44:56,693 --> 00:45:00,288
- Bless you, Robin. We'll never forget you.
- Our humble thanks, master.

439
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,831
- May we be worthy, Robin.
- You are, mother, you are.

440
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,731
- Have you eaten well, friend?
- Yes, thank you, Robin Hood.

441
00:45:06,903 --> 00:45:09,303
We humbly thank you, master.

442
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:17,875
I'm sorry to have to show you that. But once
these poor people were happy and contented.

443
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,744
Just simple villagers
who never harmed a soul.

444
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:26,947
And now... Tortured, eyes put out,
tongues slit, ears hacked off.

445
00:45:27,924 --> 00:45:32,759
They come to me for protection
against your Norman friends.

446
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,161
But you've taken Norman lives.

447
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,302
Yes, those that deserved it.
The cruel and unjust.

448
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:41,904
You're a strange man.

449
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,872
Strange? Because I can feel for beaten,
helpless people?

450
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,035
No, you're strange because you want
to do something about it.

451
00:45:49,212 --> 00:45:53,945
You're willing to defy Sir Guy, even Prince
John himself. To risk your own life.

452
00:45:54,117 --> 00:45:58,349
- And one of those men was a Norman.
- Norman or Saxon. What's that matter?

453
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:02,925
- It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.
- But it's lost you your rank, your lands.

454
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:07,257
It's made you a hunted outlaw, when
you might have lived in comfort and security.

455
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,262
What's your reward for all this?

456
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:14,599
Reward?
You just don't understand, do you?

457
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,137
I'm sorry.

458
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:21,670
I do begin to see a little now.

459
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:27,315
If you do, then that's reward enough.

460
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:51,266
Now that you've robbed us and had your fill
of insulting us, we wish to leave.

461
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,602
- Come, Lady Marian.
- My men will escort my lady.

462
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:57,679
But before you take leave, it might be well
if you thanked her for saving your life.

463
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:59,110
My life?

464
00:46:59,282 --> 00:47:03,514
Do you think you would have left this forest
alive if it hadn't been for her presence here?

465
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:05,851
- Peter! Harold!
- Yes, master?

466
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:10,652
Take six men and guide our loyal host and
his nervous friend to the Nottingham Road.

467
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,318
But our horses, our clothes.

468
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,091
You'll return to Nottingham
as you are, on foot.

469
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:19,997
This, Sir Guy, will at least be a lesson to you
in humility, if not in mercy.

470
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,105
- Your people will be returned tomorrow.
- But the lady Marian.

471
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:26,242
You'd best be started
before I have a change of mind.

472
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,742
I think we'd better go.

473
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,950
Now, my lady.

474
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,923
Friar Tuck! Little John!

475
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,330
Take the lady
to the Abbey of the Black Canons...

476
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:52,593
...so tomorrow the bishop
can give her escort the rest of the way.

477
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:56,637
- May I go too?
- With your permission, my lady?

478
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,887
Goodbye, my lady.

479
00:48:11,254 --> 00:48:12,846
Goodbye.

480
00:48:31,037 --> 00:48:33,665
- He took everything you had collected?
- Every silver penny.

481
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,502
And you two nincompoops sat there
and let him do it.

482
00:48:36,676 --> 00:48:41,477
- Oh, we resisted as well as we could.
- Where are your wounds? Your bruises?

483
00:48:41,648 --> 00:48:44,242
- And where are your men?
- What did Your Highness expect?

484
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:47,682
With the Lady Marian in our company
and Locksley's men outnumbering us.

485
00:48:47,854 --> 00:48:50,414
And not an arrow wound to divide
among them, I suppose.

486
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,787
And more than 30,000 marks
in the hands of that wolf's head.

487
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,690
That fellow's got to be taken.
Understand?

488
00:48:56,863 --> 00:48:59,263
And how does Your Highness suggest
that he be taken?

489
00:48:59,432 --> 00:49:03,425
- lf I may be so bold as to inquire?
- Mind your words, Gisbourne.

490
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:06,970
You're fortunate not to be paying
for this with your head.

491
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:11,634
Your Highness, sir, I could muster an army
and surround Sherwood.

492
00:49:12,178 --> 00:49:14,442
- You couldn't capture him...
- You mind your words.

493
00:49:14,614 --> 00:49:17,276
...if he sat in your lap
shooting arrows at a crow.

494
00:49:17,484 --> 00:49:18,712
Arrows!

495
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:23,049
- He said shooting arrows at a crow.
- Take that silly looking bonnet off.

496
00:49:23,223 --> 00:49:26,886
That stirs something in my mind.
Perhaps we can't take him by force.

497
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,120
He's too well protected.
Knows Sherwood's hidden paths well. But...

498
00:49:30,296 --> 00:49:31,854
- But what?
- We'll outwit him.

499
00:49:32,031 --> 00:49:33,965
We'll hold an archery tournament!

500
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:35,464
Archery tour...

501
00:49:35,635 --> 00:49:39,969
And have him fly in on the end of one
of his own arrows? That's marvelous.

502
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:43,040
He's the finest archer in the North.
Think he'd forgo shooting...

503
00:49:43,209 --> 00:49:46,872
...against the archers of all England?
We'll give a prize. Say, a golden arrow.

504
00:49:47,046 --> 00:49:49,674
And ask him to risk his neck for that?

505
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:54,752
That won't be the only bait, with
the Lady Marian presenting the arrow herself.

506
00:49:55,555 --> 00:49:56,783
What do you mean?

507
00:49:56,956 --> 00:50:00,084
When they came out of the forest,
she seemed very friendly.

508
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,854
And didn't you notice
how his eyes never left her?

509
00:50:03,029 --> 00:50:04,826
- Yes, yes, I noticed.
- Well, then!

510
00:50:04,998 --> 00:50:08,263
- Well, then, how do we get word to him?
- Get word to Robin...

511
00:50:08,434 --> 00:50:10,994
...who has an eye in every bush
and ears in every wall?

512
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,468
But even if he comes,
won't he be disguised?

513
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,633
Whether he be dressed as priest, beggar,
knight, palmer, what disguise can conceal...

514
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,334
...the finest archer in England?

515
00:50:19,512 --> 00:50:22,504
The man who wins the golden arrow
will be Robin Hood.

516
00:50:22,682 --> 00:50:25,310
Will you take that bonnet off?

517
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:15,733
I hope our little golden hook
will catch the fish.

518
00:51:15,902 --> 00:51:18,063
- You hope?
- Oh, it will if he's here.

519
00:51:18,237 --> 00:51:22,640
If he's not, we'll stick your head
upon the target and shoot at that.

520
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:24,572
- Are your men sure of their orders?
- Yes.

521
00:51:24,744 --> 00:51:28,373
They're stationed all around the field.
Even a worm couldn't get through.

522
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:30,175
You talk as if this were a trap.

523
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:36,311
Oh, no, my dear. Just a precaution in case
the Saxons create a disturbance.

524
00:51:40,293 --> 00:51:46,630
By orders of His Highness Prince John, the
champions of Sir Guy and the knights...

525
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:51,259
...will be limited to three flights of arrows
for the eliminations.

526
00:51:51,437 --> 00:51:55,601
The winning team will meet all comers.

527
00:52:16,763 --> 00:52:19,596
- You know it's a trap.
- A golden arrow, from the lady herself.

528
00:52:19,766 --> 00:52:23,224
- They've cooked up this thing to take you.
- Well, what of it?

529
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:26,429
- You know what'll happen if they do.
- Where's your sporting blood?

530
00:52:26,606 --> 00:52:29,541
Sir Guy accepted our invitation.
We'd be rude not to accept his.

531
00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:34,737
- It'd be ruder to get your neck stretched.
- There, my band getting fat and overfed.

532
00:52:34,914 --> 00:52:37,041
Where's your love of fights,
risk, adventure?

533
00:52:37,216 --> 00:52:41,550
Well, since our friend seems to have gone
a little mad, I'll have to see him through.

534
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:43,655
We'll have to see him through.

535
00:52:59,806 --> 00:53:01,569
Prepare final flight.

536
00:53:03,509 --> 00:53:07,502
Does my lady find it interesting?
Lady Marian?

537
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,080
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I asked if you found it interesting.

538
00:53:10,249 --> 00:53:13,980
Yes, very.
They're splendid archers.

539
00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:16,519
You'll find it much more
interesting later on.

540
00:53:22,328 --> 00:53:26,856
The winning team will compete
as individuals.

541
00:53:27,033 --> 00:53:30,059
Captain Phillip of Arras.

542
00:53:30,236 --> 00:53:34,866
Elwyn the Welshman.
Matt of Sleaford.

543
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:38,169
They now challenge all comers.

544
00:53:38,344 --> 00:53:41,643
The men who'd shoot against that lot
have to have the eyes of a falcon.

545
00:53:41,814 --> 00:53:44,442
They're far too good for me.
I'm not shooting today.

546
00:54:54,587 --> 00:54:57,988
Remaining archers will use
center target.

547
00:55:10,536 --> 00:55:12,265
Matt of Sleaford, out!

548
00:55:12,438 --> 00:55:15,202
Elwyn the Welshman, out!

549
00:55:22,615 --> 00:55:24,480
- The tall tinker.
- Now is the time.

550
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:28,177
Not so hasty, Sir Guy. I'm enjoying myself.
Let them finish the match.

551
00:55:28,354 --> 00:55:31,517
- But he could...
- Have your men close in if you wish.

552
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:38,927
Look.

553
00:55:39,098 --> 00:55:41,498
Yeah, they're closing in.
I hope Robin sees them.

554
00:55:52,912 --> 00:55:55,847
I must commend Your Highness
for the subtlety of your scheme.

555
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:16,262
Very good. Would you say you'd seen
that tall fellow before?

556
00:56:16,435 --> 00:56:19,666
And if I had, what interest
could a tinker have for me?

557
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:22,034
Phillip of Arras shoots next.

558
00:56:25,745 --> 00:56:28,543
Tie!
You will be allowed another flight.

559
00:56:28,714 --> 00:56:33,742
Target's a deal too close. Can we have
it removed to a fit distance to shoot at?

560
00:56:35,855 --> 00:56:37,550
Another 20 paces!

561
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:45,820
If your archer captain wins at that distance,
I'll give you 1000 gold marks for him.

562
00:56:45,998 --> 00:56:49,058
Win or lose, I'll give him
to Your Highness for a favor.

563
00:56:49,568 --> 00:56:52,503
Provided you let me deal
with this wolf's head in my own way.

564
00:56:52,672 --> 00:56:56,870
Done. I'm leaving for Norwich immediately
after the tournament anyway...

565
00:56:57,043 --> 00:56:59,238
...so you may do what you please
with him.

566
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:06,712
Why, he can't win now.
No living man could beat that shot.

567
00:57:06,886 --> 00:57:10,049
I'll wager 100 marks on Phillip of Arras!

568
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:18,924
He split Phillip's arrow.

569
00:57:20,032 --> 00:57:22,364
The tinker wins! He wins!

570
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,079
- What is your name, archer?
- Godfrey of Sherwood, Your Highness.

571
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:48,954
How is it that a tinker learned so well
the use of arms?

572
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:55,033
Even a peaceful tinker must protect himself
these days from treachery and other things.

573
00:57:55,201 --> 00:57:58,034
It's earned you more
than you bargained for today.

574
00:57:59,138 --> 00:58:01,470
I pronounce you champion archer
of England.

575
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:06,703
And from the gracious hand of Lady Marian
Fitzwalter, you'll receive your reward.

576
00:58:10,716 --> 00:58:12,274
Advance.

577
00:58:22,695 --> 00:58:26,791
I... Here is your prize, sir archer.

578
00:58:26,966 --> 00:58:31,460
It's indeed an honor to receive it
from the hands of so beautiful a lady.

579
00:58:32,004 --> 00:58:36,304
- How is it that you didn't use a black arrow?
- That's my court of last resort, Sir Guy.

580
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:39,967
- Its verdict is always final.
- Arrest this man!

581
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:28,184
That's a good idea.

582
00:59:30,996 --> 00:59:32,725
You're a very rash young man.

583
00:59:32,898 --> 00:59:36,732
And I'm sorry I can't be in Nottingham
to see what Gisbourne has in store for you.

584
00:59:36,902 --> 00:59:39,894
- It'll be something special, I'm sure.
- I'm sure.

585
00:59:40,072 --> 00:59:42,404
Sorry I underestimated you.
Next time perhaps...

586
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:45,135
There'll be no next time.
Take him away!

587
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:19,571
"Robin of Locksley.
Known to some as the outlaw Robin Hood.

588
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:22,976
After trial, in which you did not produce
one witness in your behalf...

589
01:00:23,149 --> 01:00:26,141
...you've been found guilty of outlawry,
theft, murder, abduction...

590
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:30,482
...false pretenses, contempt of the Crown,
poaching in royal forests and high treason."

591
01:00:30,656 --> 01:00:32,590
Haven't you forgotten
a count or two?

592
01:00:33,058 --> 01:00:36,391
Surely it's a crime under the noble
Prince John to love one's country.

593
01:00:36,562 --> 01:00:39,258
To protect serfs from injustice
and be loyal to one's king.

594
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:44,464
If I could add anything to the charges
against you, I would most gladly do so.

595
01:00:44,637 --> 01:00:48,198
"It is the sentence of this tribunal,
on the morrow at high noon you be taken...

596
01:00:48,374 --> 01:00:52,640
...to the square in Nottingham and there
hanged by the neck until you are dead."

597
01:00:54,713 --> 01:00:58,513
There may be some who will regret
that a man of your peculiar talents...

598
01:00:58,684 --> 01:01:00,948
...should be cut off so early in life.
But personally...

599
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,647
You think the sentence extremely lenient.
Thank you.

600
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,420
What's troubling you, my lady?
Is it the outlaw?

601
01:02:15,494 --> 01:02:20,090
Yes. I hate to see a human
being trapped...

602
01:02:20,566 --> 01:02:24,093
Bess, you know where his men
may be found, don't you?

603
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:26,704
- Why, my lady, how should I know?
- Don't put me off.

604
01:02:26,872 --> 01:02:29,841
That little man who liked you.
You've been seeing him?

605
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:31,772
- Yes, my lady.
- Tell me where.

606
01:02:31,944 --> 01:02:34,276
- Do you want to send a message?
- To his men, yes.

607
01:02:34,446 --> 01:02:37,711
Well, my lady, I have had a nip of ale
of a night, just now and again...

608
01:02:37,883 --> 01:02:41,649
...at a place in the town and I won't deny
as some of the others were there.

609
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:45,847
Where was it?
Oh, Bess, please tell me!

610
01:02:46,325 --> 01:02:51,820
It was a tavern, my lady.
The Saracen's Head in Pilgrim Court.

611
01:02:51,997 --> 01:02:54,522
- The landlord's name is Humility Prin.
- Humility Prin.

612
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,430
- Knock at the door and say, "A Locksley."
- "A Locksley."

613
01:02:57,603 --> 01:03:00,231
- Yes, but...
- Get me a cloak, quickly!

614
01:03:00,406 --> 01:03:03,170
Yes, madame.
Oh, dear...

615
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:10,606
- But there must be some way...
- lf we had to, couldn't we storm the place?

616
01:03:10,783 --> 01:03:13,911
Why, you'd need an army
with a battering ram to even dent it.

617
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:16,111
Aye, he'll be hanged for sure.

618
01:03:16,288 --> 01:03:18,779
Maybe Little John's right.
Perhaps we should...

619
01:03:22,461 --> 01:03:24,053
A Locksley.

620
01:03:36,108 --> 01:03:38,770
- What is it, Prin?
- A lady, sir. The Lady Marian.

621
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:43,074
- What?
- It's a trap, Will. Watch those windows.

622
01:03:43,248 --> 01:03:45,239
She has the password, all right.

623
01:03:45,417 --> 01:03:47,510
- Is she alone?
- Yes, sir.

624
01:03:47,686 --> 01:03:49,313
Fetch her in.

625
01:04:04,603 --> 01:04:07,731
- What do you want, my lady?
- I want to help him.

626
01:04:07,906 --> 01:04:11,672
- How did you find us here?
- Never mind that now.

627
01:04:13,212 --> 01:04:16,181
Please don't stand there staring.
Tell me what I can do.

628
01:04:16,348 --> 01:04:20,045
- Don't trust her. It's a Norman trick.
- Would I come here alone if it were a trap?

629
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:25,020
What's to prevent your killing me if...? Is
there no one here with sense enough to see?

630
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:26,748
One moment.

631
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,687
We have to make sure, my child.
You're a good daughter of the church?

632
01:04:32,965 --> 01:04:35,559
You swear by Our Lady
that you want to help Robin?

633
01:04:35,734 --> 01:04:37,361
I swear, good Father.

634
01:04:37,803 --> 01:04:39,327
- Have you thought of a way?
- Yes.

635
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:42,736
- Can you get us in the castle?
- That's no good. He's heavily guarded.

636
01:04:42,908 --> 01:04:44,773
But I thought of another way.
Listen.

637
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:19,367
- This is a rare treat, isn't it, my lady?
- Yes, isn't it?

638
01:05:19,545 --> 01:05:22,275
With Locksley out of the way,
we'll stamp out the rest.

639
01:05:22,681 --> 01:05:26,947
Won't it be a pleasant surprise
for Prince John when he returns?

640
01:05:28,587 --> 01:05:32,887
And to think that I was once foolish enough
to believe that you rather liked him.

641
01:05:33,158 --> 01:05:35,285
Why, your hand is trembling.

642
01:06:15,133 --> 01:06:17,363
Take him to the gallows.

643
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:27,206
Take him up there.

644
01:07:02,014 --> 01:07:05,643
He'll not be so insolent
when they've stretched his neck.

645
01:07:06,585 --> 01:07:08,382
Get ready.

646
01:07:23,769 --> 01:07:25,430
Stop him!

647
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:57,569
Stop! Guards!

648
01:08:10,082 --> 01:08:11,913
Friar Tuck! Much!

649
01:08:12,084 --> 01:08:14,382
- Here we are, sir!
- Here we are, safe and sound!

650
01:08:14,553 --> 01:08:16,145
Back to camp!

651
01:08:38,176 --> 01:08:40,474
Robin! Where are you?

652
01:08:41,647 --> 01:08:44,207
Here I am. Stand by!

653
01:09:29,194 --> 01:09:31,458
He is different from anyone I've ever known.

654
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:36,897
He's, well, he's brave and he's reckless,
and yet he's gentle and kind.

655
01:09:37,069 --> 01:09:38,900
He's not brutal like...

656
01:09:39,071 --> 01:09:43,440
Tell me, when you are in love, is it...

657
01:09:43,608 --> 01:09:46,441
...well, is it hard to think of anybody
but one person?

658
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:49,444
Yes, indeed, and sometimes
there's a bit of trouble sleeping.

659
01:09:49,614 --> 01:09:52,276
I know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping.

660
01:09:52,451 --> 01:09:54,544
Yes, and it affects your appetite too.

661
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,918
Not that I've noticed it's done that to you,
except when he was waiting to be hanged.

662
01:09:59,091 --> 01:10:01,389
Does it make you want
to be with him all the time?

663
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,826
Yes. And when he's with you,
your legs are weak as water.

664
01:10:05,997 --> 01:10:10,331
Tell me, my lady, when he looks at you,
do you feel a kind of prickly feeling...

665
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:14,598
...like goosy pimples running
all up and down your spine?

666
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,670
- Then there's not a doubt of it.
- Doubt of what?

667
01:10:17,843 --> 01:10:19,743
That you're in love!

668
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,573
What do you want?

669
01:10:24,416 --> 01:10:25,678
Robin!

670
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:29,617
- I must say. I must say!
- Keep quiet, Bess.

671
01:10:29,788 --> 01:10:31,779
Are you completely mad?

672
01:10:31,957 --> 01:10:34,050
- Why did you come here?
- To see you.

673
01:10:34,226 --> 01:10:35,523
But don't you realize that...?

674
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:38,527
My men told me what you did for me,
so I've come to thank you.

675
01:10:38,697 --> 01:10:42,258
And after what I couldn't help overhearing
about that prickly feeling...

676
01:10:42,434 --> 01:10:43,799
...I'm very glad I did come.

677
01:10:43,969 --> 01:10:47,302
That was a game.
Now, you've got to go at once!

678
01:10:47,472 --> 01:10:50,202
A game?
Well, couldn't I join in?

679
01:10:50,742 --> 01:10:55,839
Of course, I probably wouldn't be
as good at it as this pretty young girl.

680
01:10:56,548 --> 01:10:57,947
But I could do my best.

681
01:10:58,116 --> 01:10:59,447
Bess, will you leave us?

682
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,677
Please!

683
01:11:13,799 --> 01:11:16,290
Now, let's see, where does this game begin?

684
01:11:16,468 --> 01:11:20,461
Oh, I know. It's simple.
We'll start where you're in love with me.

685
01:11:20,639 --> 01:11:24,439
You are, aren't you?
Because I am with you, terribly.

686
01:11:24,609 --> 01:11:27,271
That's why I came.
I had to see you again.

687
01:11:27,445 --> 01:11:29,811
You must go at once.
And I don't love you.

688
01:11:29,981 --> 01:11:33,974
- Oh! Are you sure?
- Yes.

689
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:37,550
Very well then, I'll go.

690
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:44,486
You know, this is rather unfriendly of you,
exposing me to my enemies like this.

691
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:50,497
Now, let me see. There's a fat old captain
of the guard down there with bow legs.

692
01:11:50,669 --> 01:11:52,864
If I drop on him that'll bend them out worse.

693
01:11:53,038 --> 01:11:55,700
An archer! He's too thin.
I might miss him altogether.

694
01:11:55,874 --> 01:11:57,671
- Robin!
- The very thing.

695
01:11:57,843 --> 01:12:00,778
Five men-at-arms in a group.
They'll break the fall beautifully.

696
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:02,470
- Goodbye, my lady!
- Robin!

697
01:12:02,647 --> 01:12:04,137
- Yes?
- Please.

698
01:12:04,316 --> 01:12:06,079
Then you do love me? Don't you?

699
01:12:06,251 --> 01:12:08,219
- Don't you?
- You know I do.

700
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:10,411
Well, that's different.

701
01:12:23,935 --> 01:12:26,403
- Do you know you're very impudent?
- Me?

702
01:12:26,571 --> 01:12:27,560
You are!

703
01:12:27,739 --> 01:12:31,334
When my guardian, King Richard,
finds out about your being in love with me...

704
01:12:31,509 --> 01:12:33,841
- I know, he'll make me court jester.
- He won't!

705
01:12:34,012 --> 01:12:36,105
He'll stick your funny head on London Gate.

706
01:12:36,281 --> 01:12:38,977
And a fine decoration it will be,
my bold Norman beauty.

707
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:41,050
- I'm not bold.
- Well, you're Norman.

708
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:45,121
Well, I don't hold that against you.
And you are a beauty.

709
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:47,724
- You're the most beautiful...
- You're leaving at once.

710
01:12:47,893 --> 01:12:50,760
Please, darling, every minute
you're here you're in danger.

711
01:12:50,929 --> 01:12:52,123
I'll go.

712
01:12:52,297 --> 01:12:56,961
- Marian, will you come with me?
- To Sherwood?

713
01:12:57,135 --> 01:13:01,731
I've nothing to offer you but a life of
hardship and danger, but we'd be together.

714
01:13:01,907 --> 01:13:05,138
- But, Robin, dear...
- I know. It's asking a lot, but who knows...

715
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:10,543
...how long it'll be before Richard returns.
Friar Tuck could marry us. Will you?

716
01:13:10,715 --> 01:13:12,979
Because I love you, Robin, I'd come.

717
01:13:13,151 --> 01:13:15,711
Even the danger would mean nothing
if you were with me.

718
01:13:15,887 --> 01:13:17,047
Then you will?

719
01:13:17,222 --> 01:13:21,022
No. Listen to me, darling.
You remember that day in Sherwood Forest?

720
01:13:21,192 --> 01:13:24,787
I realized then for the first time
that what you were doing was right...

721
01:13:24,963 --> 01:13:26,225
...and that we were wrong.

722
01:13:26,398 --> 01:13:27,660
No, let me finish.

723
01:13:27,832 --> 01:13:30,528
You taught me England
is bigger than Normans and Saxons...

724
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:32,329
...fighting and hating each other.

725
01:13:32,504 --> 01:13:35,268
That it belongs to all of us,
to live peacefully together...

726
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,305
...loyal only to Richard and to England.

727
01:13:37,475 --> 01:13:39,272
But, darling, you could help.

728
01:13:39,444 --> 01:13:42,311
I could help much more
by watching for treachery here...

729
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,143
...and leaving you free to protect
Richard's people until he returns.

730
01:13:46,318 --> 01:13:49,754
Now do you see why
you have to go back to your men alone?

731
01:14:09,574 --> 01:14:12,509
Go now, quickly, dearest.

732
01:14:13,411 --> 01:14:16,380
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye.

733
01:14:32,697 --> 01:14:35,757
- Goodbye, my love.
- Goodbye.

734
01:15:05,897 --> 01:15:10,197
- You gentlemen have traveled far?
- Yes, quite a distance.

735
01:15:10,368 --> 01:15:13,360
I'm sorry I can't give you better food.

736
01:15:14,873 --> 01:15:18,570
- There is little left to us these days.
- This will be enough.

737
01:15:18,743 --> 01:15:21,405
The inn at Luton was well supplied.
How is that?

738
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:24,411
That's a Norman inn.

739
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:32,218
But it's an outrage!
I'll complain to Prince John.

740
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:36,520
I'll have this rascal's ears, no matter how.
Dares to rob me!

741
01:15:36,694 --> 01:15:38,662
Strip my person of jewels!

742
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:42,857
What's this country coming to when a high
churchman can't travel the forest in safety?

743
01:15:43,034 --> 01:15:46,197
- Who's he?
- The Bishop of the Black Canons.

744
01:15:46,371 --> 01:15:49,772
- Do you wish to go on after dinner?
- No. We can't reach the abbey tonight.

745
01:15:49,941 --> 01:15:52,171
- I'll stay. Tend to the horses.
- Yes, Your Grace.

746
01:15:52,343 --> 01:15:54,436
- Bring food to us!
- Yes, Your Grace, at once!

747
01:15:54,612 --> 01:15:58,241
It's no longer safe to journey anywhere.
Robbers at every turn of the road.

748
01:15:58,416 --> 01:16:01,249
- What happened, Your Grace?
- I told you! We've been robbed.

749
01:16:01,419 --> 01:16:04,855
Not a chance to defend ourselves.
They burst on us from ambush.

750
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:07,389
- Who did?
- Why, Robin Hood, of course.

751
01:16:07,559 --> 01:16:09,356
There's no other with impudence enough.

752
01:16:09,527 --> 01:16:11,427
Robin Hood again, sire.

753
01:16:14,165 --> 01:16:17,726
- You've heard of him, then?
- Oh, he seems well known hereabouts.

754
01:16:17,902 --> 01:16:23,841
- Oh, then you're strange to this shire?
- More or less.

755
01:16:24,008 --> 01:16:25,908
What might be your names, gentlemen?

756
01:16:26,077 --> 01:16:28,807
They're hardly important enough
to deserve your interest.

757
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,972
- Landlord, where's our ale?
- Coming, sirs.

758
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:34,243
Will you gentlemen
be remaining here tonight?

759
01:16:34,419 --> 01:16:37,820
We hadn't decided, Your Grace.
What would you advise?

760
01:16:37,989 --> 01:16:42,153
Well, there's so much danger on the road,
you'd be far safer here.

761
01:16:42,327 --> 01:16:46,127
We will then, since we'll have
the added pleasure of your company.

762
01:16:46,297 --> 01:16:51,428
Well, I should really like to stay, but I
recollected some urgent affairs at my abbey.

763
01:16:51,603 --> 01:16:55,699
Some other time, or perhaps you would break
your journey and sup with me tomorrow.

764
01:16:55,874 --> 01:16:57,000
Your Grace is too kind.

765
01:16:57,175 --> 01:17:00,736
Then I bid you good evening, gentlemen,
and God speed you in the morning.

766
01:17:00,912 --> 01:17:02,846
Thank you. Good night.

767
01:17:10,622 --> 01:17:12,249
The window!

768
01:17:16,361 --> 01:17:18,727
Are there beds prepared, landlord?

769
01:17:18,897 --> 01:17:22,594
Let's to sleep, then. I'm tired.

770
01:17:26,971 --> 01:17:30,338
- I'm afraid he suspects, sire.
- I fear so.

771
01:17:30,508 --> 01:17:34,877
His Grace is a Norman. Did you see the fear
on the landlord's face when he came in?

772
01:17:35,046 --> 01:17:38,015
I've seen it in the faces
of thousands since we returned.

773
01:17:38,183 --> 01:17:40,174
I ought never to have left England.

774
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:42,410
I noticed when Robin Hood's
name is mentioned...

775
01:17:42,587 --> 01:17:44,521
The mysterious outlaw
whom we have sought.

776
01:17:44,689 --> 01:17:48,989
In vain. However, the bishop
didn't have any difficulty meeting him.

777
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,559
Which gives me an idea.

778
01:17:52,063 --> 01:17:54,463
- And you're sure it was Richard?
- No doubt of it.

779
01:17:54,632 --> 01:17:56,657
How like my dear brother this is!

780
01:17:56,834 --> 01:18:00,201
He couldn't rot in Durnstein
like any decent man.

781
01:18:01,806 --> 01:18:04,001
- But Richard has no army.
- No, Your Highness.

782
01:18:04,175 --> 01:18:08,043
- lf he had, we should have heard of it.
- lf my brother happened to be killed...

783
01:18:08,213 --> 01:18:11,376
- England would have a new king.
- That would be murder! I'll have no part...

784
01:18:11,549 --> 01:18:15,485
You'll do as you're told!
That's very simple. Keep your mouth closed.

785
01:18:15,653 --> 01:18:16,984
Your Highness, I beg of you!

786
01:18:17,155 --> 01:18:21,057
How long will you retain your abbey
if Richard survives to find out...

787
01:18:21,226 --> 01:18:24,218
...what you've been up to
these years he's been away?

788
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:30,963
Go on, Gisbourne. Who's to...?

789
01:18:31,135 --> 01:18:34,036
Dickon was a knight before
your brother hacked off his spurs...

790
01:18:34,205 --> 01:18:35,570
...over some little mischance.

791
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:39,608
There's nothing he wouldn't do for a king
who'd restore him to rank.

792
01:18:42,113 --> 01:18:45,913
- You don't love my brother, I hear.
- I have little reason to, Your Highness.

793
01:18:46,084 --> 01:18:48,882
- You know this tavern?
- Yes.

794
01:18:49,053 --> 01:18:54,047
- lf Richard dies...
- Dickon returns to the roll of English knights.

795
01:18:54,225 --> 01:18:55,283
Am I not right?

796
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:59,362
With the manor and estate
of Robin of Locksley to support his rank.

797
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:02,363
- When shall I start?
- Immediately. How many men will you need?

798
01:19:02,533 --> 01:19:05,434
I shall do it better alone, Your Highness.

799
01:19:05,603 --> 01:19:07,400
The sooner you're crowned king...

800
01:19:07,572 --> 01:19:11,770
The better for my friends?
You're a clever fellow, Gisbourne.

801
01:19:11,943 --> 01:19:14,935
Thank you, Your Majesty.

802
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,281
Return to your abbey and make
preparations to proclaim me king...

803
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:22,317
...here in Nottingham,
the day after tomorrow.

804
01:19:34,632 --> 01:19:36,657
Do you suppose she heard?

805
01:19:37,302 --> 01:19:38,860
I don't know.

806
01:19:47,712 --> 01:19:51,671
And now you know why Robin's got to find
King Richard at once and warn him.

807
01:19:51,849 --> 01:19:53,942
Take this note to Much at Saracen's Head.

808
01:20:19,777 --> 01:20:22,211
My lady's hearing
is a little defective tonight.

809
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:26,146
When you knock at a lady's door
as if it were a tavern, you deserve to wait.

810
01:20:26,317 --> 01:20:27,682
You seem upset.

811
01:20:27,852 --> 01:20:29,877
Upset? Why should I be?

812
01:20:30,655 --> 01:20:34,853
Oh, come now, my dear Lady Marian.
You've played the innocent long enough.

813
01:20:35,026 --> 01:20:38,018
- Let's be frank with one another.
- I don't see the need.

814
01:20:38,196 --> 01:20:42,064
You're charming, Lady Marian, but not
exactly clever. You couldn't have failed...

815
01:20:42,266 --> 01:20:45,030
...to overhear what Prince John
and I were talking about.

816
01:20:45,203 --> 01:20:47,797
Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't trouble to deny it.

817
01:20:47,972 --> 01:20:52,841
And your first thought, as Richard's
loyal ward, was to warn him.

818
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:56,309
- Am I not right?
- Why, how could I warn Richard?

819
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:58,881
How did Locksley and his men
arrange his escape...

820
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:01,644
...from hanging after the archery match?

821
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:04,720
Someone here in the castle
must have got word to him.

822
01:21:04,889 --> 01:21:06,356
That's ridiculous!

823
01:21:06,524 --> 01:21:09,186
When Richard's in danger,
what more natural...

824
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,761
...than that you should try
to warn him through Locksley?

825
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:15,694
And you do intend to warn him, don't you?

826
01:21:16,134 --> 01:21:19,069
- Don't you?
- No!

827
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:26,510
If that's true,
perhaps you'd explain before Prince John...

828
01:21:26,677 --> 01:21:29,339
...and the Court of Execution
the meaning of this.

829
01:21:30,715 --> 01:21:32,706
Guard!

830
01:21:38,222 --> 01:21:40,190
Escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall.

831
01:22:10,755 --> 01:22:13,747
Not only has she consorted with
this Saxon rebel...

832
01:22:13,925 --> 01:22:18,294
...found guilty of outlawry, theft,
murder, abduction and high treason...

833
01:22:18,463 --> 01:22:22,331
...but she has betrayed
her own Norman people.

834
01:22:22,767 --> 01:22:25,634
Are you not ashamed, my Lady Marian?

835
01:22:26,504 --> 01:22:31,168
Yes, I am. Bitterly. But it's a shame
that I'm a Norman...

836
01:22:31,342 --> 01:22:34,834
...after seeing the things my fellow
countrymen have done to England.

837
01:22:35,012 --> 01:22:39,108
At first I wouldn't believe. Because I was
a Norman I wouldn't let myself believe...

838
01:22:39,317 --> 01:22:42,150
...that the horrors you inflicted
on the Saxons weren't just.

839
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:46,154
I know now why you tried so hard
to kill this outlaw whom you despised.

840
01:22:46,324 --> 01:22:49,316
It's because he was the one man
in England who protected the helpless...

841
01:22:49,494 --> 01:22:51,553
...against beasts
who were drunk on human blood!

842
01:22:51,729 --> 01:22:54,823
And now you intend
to murder your own brother!

843
01:22:55,132 --> 01:22:57,191
You'll be sorry you interfered.

844
01:22:57,368 --> 01:23:00,531
Sorry? I'd do it again if you kill me for it.

845
01:23:01,672 --> 01:23:06,974
A prophetic speech, my lady, for that
is exactly what is going to happen to you.

846
01:23:08,179 --> 01:23:10,943
You wouldn't dare.

847
01:23:11,115 --> 01:23:14,881
I'm the royal ward of King Richard
and no one but the king himself...

848
01:23:15,052 --> 01:23:17,486
...has the right to condemn me to death.

849
01:23:18,422 --> 01:23:20,447
You are quite right, my dear.

850
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:25,085
And it shall be a king who will order
your execution for high treason...

851
01:23:25,263 --> 01:23:28,460
...exactly 48 hours from now.

852
01:23:29,233 --> 01:23:30,791
Take her away.

853
01:23:34,939 --> 01:23:38,033
- Have you got it all in your stupid head now?
- Of course I have.

854
01:23:38,209 --> 01:23:41,303
Well, give Robin the whole message
exactly like I told it to you.

855
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:44,539
Bess, where was Dickon
supposed to find King Richard?

856
01:23:44,715 --> 01:23:46,114
Oh, never mind him!

857
01:23:46,284 --> 01:23:48,946
What do I care about
your kings and thrones and such?

858
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,816
Robin has gotta do something
to save my baby!

859
01:23:51,989 --> 01:23:55,254
Come on, old girl.
Robin will look after her, all right.

860
01:23:55,426 --> 01:23:57,917
- Where's Dickon heading for?
- Kent Road Tavern.

861
01:23:58,095 --> 01:24:02,191
Kent Road Tavern? You can save three miles
and cut him off through Low Wood.

862
01:24:02,366 --> 01:24:05,267
Come on, lass,
give us a kiss and wish me luck.

863
01:24:07,271 --> 01:24:10,331
Hurry up and take your ugly face out of here.

864
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:13,602
Oh, Much.
Oh, you will be careful, won't you?

865
01:24:13,778 --> 01:24:15,905
Of course I will.

866
01:25:34,425 --> 01:25:36,791
Greetings, sir abbot!

867
01:25:47,705 --> 01:25:51,266
- You've traveled far this morning?
- Too far to be patient with delay now.

868
01:25:51,442 --> 01:25:55,401
Perhaps it's the weight of your purse
that wearies you. Now, I can remedy that.

869
01:25:55,579 --> 01:25:59,811
If it weighs more than a just amount
I'll share it with those who have less. Come.

870
01:25:59,984 --> 01:26:02,885
You think I hand my purse
to every rough lout who asks for it?

871
01:26:10,661 --> 01:26:12,094
You see, sir abbot?

872
01:26:12,263 --> 01:26:15,232
We're poor outlaws,
with nothing to eat but the king's deer...

873
01:26:15,399 --> 01:26:19,335
...while you have property,
rents, and silver. So your purse!

874
01:26:19,503 --> 01:26:22,597
I've traveled far on the king's business
and the silver I have left...

875
01:26:22,773 --> 01:26:24,138
...equals no more than 60 marks.

876
01:26:24,308 --> 01:26:27,573
What?
Are you friendly to our good King Richard?

877
01:26:28,546 --> 01:26:30,013
I love no man better.

878
01:26:30,181 --> 01:26:32,046
By that speech you save half your money.

879
01:26:32,216 --> 01:26:34,684
Give me 30 marks for the poor
and the rest you may keep.

880
01:26:34,852 --> 01:26:35,910
Then I can go free?

881
01:26:36,087 --> 01:26:41,115
Any friend of Richard's is free of this forest.
Would you honor us by sharing meat with us?

882
01:26:41,292 --> 01:26:43,157
- Gladly.
- Then come.

883
01:26:50,501 --> 01:26:54,665
- Well, sir rascal, tell me, who are you?
- I'm called Robin Hood.

884
01:26:54,839 --> 01:26:56,431
It seems I've heard of you.

885
01:26:56,607 --> 01:26:59,872
- Nothing good, I hope.
- Oh, now I remember!

886
01:27:00,044 --> 01:27:02,877
How does your loyalty
to Richard set on a killer of knights...

887
01:27:03,047 --> 01:27:05,277
...a poacher of the king's deer
and an outlaw?

888
01:27:05,449 --> 01:27:08,714
Those I kill died from misusing
the trust that Richard left them.

889
01:27:08,886 --> 01:27:11,446
And the worst rogue of these
is the king's own brother.

890
01:27:11,622 --> 01:27:14,250
- Oh, then you blame Prince John.
- No, I blame Richard.

891
01:27:14,425 --> 01:27:18,623
His task was defending his people instead
of deserting them to fight in foreign lands.

892
01:27:18,796 --> 01:27:20,787
What?
You'd condemn Holy Crusades?

893
01:27:20,965 --> 01:27:25,629
I'll condemn anything that leaves the task
of holding England to outlaws like me.

894
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,843
Much!

895
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:46,551
- Much, what's happened to you?
- Take me to Robin, quick!

896
01:28:08,445 --> 01:28:11,608
- Much, what's happened?
- King Richard's in England. In Sherwood!

897
01:28:11,782 --> 01:28:12,942
What?

898
01:28:13,117 --> 01:28:16,848
Prince John sent Dickon to Kent Road Tavern
last night to kill the king.

899
01:28:17,021 --> 01:28:20,286
- Will, take 50 men to the Kent Road Tavern...
- No need, master, no need.

900
01:28:20,457 --> 01:28:24,325
I headed Dickon off.
He ain't gonna murder no one no more.

901
01:28:25,029 --> 01:28:28,863
- But the king? Where is he?
- I don't know, master.

902
01:28:29,533 --> 01:28:32,093
Men, Richard must be found.

903
01:28:32,269 --> 01:28:33,896
He must be brought here for safety.

904
01:28:34,071 --> 01:28:36,232
Little John, take a party
and scour the country.

905
01:28:36,407 --> 01:28:39,968
Friar Tuck, into the town.
Will, search every inn and cottage.

906
01:28:40,144 --> 01:28:42,942
Don't rest, day or night,
until he's found. Understand?

907
01:28:43,113 --> 01:28:46,139
You don't need to search for Richard, Robin.

908
01:28:46,317 --> 01:28:50,048
- He's in good hands. The best in England.
- What do you mean? Where is he?

909
01:28:50,888 --> 01:28:52,515
Here!

910
01:28:59,396 --> 01:29:01,227
Sire.

911
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:16,308
All these have remained loyal.

912
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,710
Rise, Sir Robin.

913
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:21,210
Rise, men of Sherwood.

914
01:29:22,152 --> 01:29:24,814
Sire, Prince John's calling
Bishop of the Black Canons...

915
01:29:24,989 --> 01:29:27,082
...to proclaim him king
in Nottingham tomorrow.

916
01:29:27,258 --> 01:29:29,749
- How'd you learn this?
- Lady Marian. She overheard.

917
01:29:29,927 --> 01:29:31,656
They've taken her for treason.

918
01:29:31,829 --> 01:29:34,491
She's been condemned
to the block for warning us.

919
01:29:34,665 --> 01:29:36,599
He wouldn't dare execute the king's ward.

920
01:29:36,767 --> 01:29:40,362
You underestimate him. If we're to save
her and your throne, we've got to act now!

921
01:29:40,537 --> 01:29:41,970
By attacking Nottingham castle?

922
01:29:42,139 --> 01:29:45,336
Without an army it'll be much too strong.
Your men will be killed.

923
01:29:45,509 --> 01:29:48,876
If the Bishop of the Black Canons
is performing the ceremony tomorrow...

924
01:29:49,046 --> 01:29:53,142
...suppose we visit him at his abbey tonight
and persuade him to suggest a way.

925
01:30:15,339 --> 01:30:17,637
Brace up. Smile!

926
01:30:19,977 --> 01:30:21,638
Wider!

927
01:30:21,879 --> 01:30:24,871
Still sure it wasn't you
who warned my brother I was in England?

928
01:30:25,049 --> 01:30:26,676
Why, sire, believe me, I...

929
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:29,478
Your Grace, smile!

930
01:30:30,254 --> 01:30:32,552
You'll sweat the lard
off that fat carcass of yours...

931
01:30:32,723 --> 01:30:34,714
...before this day's over, my pudgy friend.

932
01:30:34,892 --> 01:30:38,760
And I hope some Norman sword
whittles you down to size!

933
01:30:50,808 --> 01:30:52,708
Oh, Lord, we beseech thee.

934
01:30:52,876 --> 01:30:56,676
Sanctify this thy servant,
our royal Prince John.

935
01:30:56,847 --> 01:31:02,251
Enrich his noble heart and bestow
upon him all princely virtues.

936
01:31:02,419 --> 01:31:04,148
Amen.

937
01:31:04,321 --> 01:31:05,982
No news of Richard.

938
01:31:06,156 --> 01:31:07,919
No. None, Your Highness.

939
01:31:08,092 --> 01:31:09,559
Then Dickon must have...

940
01:31:09,727 --> 01:31:12,218
Sir Dickon, Your Highness.

941
01:31:12,963 --> 01:31:16,455
Of course. Of course.

942
01:31:19,737 --> 01:31:23,468
We are ready for the ceremony,
Your Majesty.

943
01:33:41,111 --> 01:33:43,045
Remember.

944
01:33:48,785 --> 01:33:52,118
By what authority do you,
John Lackland, Prince of England...

945
01:33:52,289 --> 01:33:55,690
...claim to be crowned this day,
sovereign of the realm...

946
01:33:55,859 --> 01:33:59,795
...and as defender of the Holy Sepulcher,
to receive the blessing of the church?

947
01:33:59,963 --> 01:34:03,694
By right of blood succession.
According to the law of the realm.

948
01:34:03,867 --> 01:34:06,836
Is it of your own free will
that you thus depose your brother...

949
01:34:07,004 --> 01:34:08,733
...Richard the Lion-Heart of England?

950
01:34:08,906 --> 01:34:10,931
Richard no longer exists!

951
01:34:11,108 --> 01:34:14,009
From this moment forward,
I, John, am king of England!

952
01:34:15,145 --> 01:34:17,204
Aren't you a little premature, brother?

953
01:34:17,381 --> 01:34:19,849
Richard! The Lion-Heart!

954
01:34:20,017 --> 01:34:22,110
He's lying! He's an imposter!

955
01:34:22,352 --> 01:34:24,684
- The king lives!
- Men of Sherwood!

956
01:34:26,456 --> 01:34:27,445
Robin Hood!

957
01:34:27,624 --> 01:34:30,149
It's a trick of the outlaws!
Kill him! Seize him!

958
01:35:56,780 --> 01:36:00,238
- Did I upset your plans?
- You've come to Nottingham once too often!

959
01:36:00,417 --> 01:36:02,908
When this is over, there'll be
no need for me to come again.

960
01:36:14,364 --> 01:36:16,355
Your sword, Gisbourne.

961
01:36:35,352 --> 01:36:37,946
- Know any prayers, my friend?
- I'll say one for you!

962
01:38:25,695 --> 01:38:27,162
Save yourself, Robin!

963
01:38:32,903 --> 01:38:37,203
The door, quick!
Quick, or I'll trim that beard for you!

964
01:39:14,811 --> 01:39:17,609
But, Richard, Richard! I thought...

965
01:39:17,781 --> 01:39:20,249
- You thought I was murdered!
- Oh, no, no.

966
01:39:20,951 --> 01:39:25,115
I didn't mean to...
After all, Richard, I am your brother.

967
01:39:25,288 --> 01:39:27,620
Yes, sire, he is your brother.

968
01:39:27,791 --> 01:39:29,088
Yes, my brother.

969
01:39:29,259 --> 01:39:32,717
I could forgive you if your treachery
were against me and not my subjects.

970
01:39:32,896 --> 01:39:36,491
I banish you and your followers from England
for the remainder of my lifetime.

971
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:39,134
Take them away.
See that they leave England.

972
01:39:39,302 --> 01:39:42,897
I further banish from my realm
all injustices and oppressions...

973
01:39:43,073 --> 01:39:46,065
...which have burdened my people.
And I pray that under my rule...

974
01:39:46,243 --> 01:39:49,610
...Normans and Saxons alike
will share the rights of Englishmen.

975
01:39:49,779 --> 01:39:52,441
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!

976
01:39:53,283 --> 01:39:55,581
What about you, Robin?

977
01:39:59,789 --> 01:40:02,314
My sword is yours, sire, now and always.

978
01:40:02,492 --> 01:40:04,585
Is there nothing the king
can grant the outlaw...

979
01:40:04,761 --> 01:40:06,524
...who showed him
his duty to his country?

980
01:40:06,696 --> 01:40:09,631
Yes, Your Majesty,
a pardon for the men of Sherwood.

981
01:40:09,799 --> 01:40:11,824
Granted with all my heart.

982
01:40:12,002 --> 01:40:14,562
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!

983
01:40:15,272 --> 01:40:18,173
But is there nothing for yourself?

984
01:40:19,676 --> 01:40:22,042
There's but one thing else, sire.

985
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,180
And do you too wish...?

986
01:40:25,916 --> 01:40:28,441
More than anything in the world, sire.

987
01:40:29,419 --> 01:40:30,716
Kneel, Robin Hood.

988
01:40:33,223 --> 01:40:37,660
Arise, Robin, Baron of Locksley,
Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham...

989
01:40:37,961 --> 01:40:40,828
...and lord of all the lands and manors
appertaining thereto.

990
01:40:40,997 --> 01:40:43,557
My first command to you, my lord earl...

991
01:40:43,733 --> 01:40:47,066
...is to take in marriage
the hand of the Lady Marian.

992
01:40:47,237 --> 01:40:51,867
Long live Robin Hood!
Long live Robin Hood!

993
01:40:52,042 --> 01:40:53,771
Long live Lady Marian!

994
01:40:53,944 --> 01:40:56,174
And what say you to that,
Baron of Locksley?

995
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:07,181
May I obey all your commands
with equal pleasure, sire!
