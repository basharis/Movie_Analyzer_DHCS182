00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:22,285
Ten centuries ago,
before the Age of Obedience,

3
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:26,062
free dogs roamed at liberty,
marking their territory.

4
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:28,205
Seeking to extend
its dominion,

5
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:31,341
<i>the cat-loving
Kobayashi Dynasty declared war</i>

6
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:32,717
<i>and descended in force</i>

7
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,989
<i>upon the unwary
four-legged beasts.</i>

8
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:38,158
<i>On the eve
of total canine annihilation,</i>

9
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,559
<i>a child warrior
sympathetic to the plight</i>

10
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:42,349
<i>of the besieged underdog dogs</i>

11
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:43,981
<i>betrayed his species,</i>

12
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:46,638
<i>beheaded the head of the head
of the Kobayashi clan</i>

13
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,886
and pledged his sword

14
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:50,191
with the following
battle-cry haiku.

15
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,326
I turn my back

16
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:54,892
On man-kind!

17
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:56,685
Frost on window-pane.

18
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:57,998
He would later be known

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,389
as the Boy Samurai
of Legend, RIP.

20
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:03,438
At the end
of the bloody dog wars,

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,086
the vanquished mongrels
became powerless house-pets:

22
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:11,149
<i>tamed, mastered, scorned.</i>

23
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:13,808
<i>But they survived
and multiplied.</i>

24
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:18,063
<i>The Kobayashis, however,</i>

25
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:20,208
<i>never forgave
their conquered foe.</i>

26
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:39,501
<i>The Japanese archipelago,</i>

27
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,328
<i>20 years in the future.</i>

28
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:09,677
<i>Canine Saturation</i>

29
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,821
<i>has reached
epidemic proportions.</i>

30
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:13,165
<i>An outbreak of Snout-fever</i>

31
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,861
<i>rips through
the City of Megasaki.</i>

32
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,965
<i>Blizzards of infected fleas,
worms, ticks and lice</i>

33
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,564
<i>menace the citizenship.</i>

34
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:22,414
<i>Dog-Flu threatens to cross
the species threshold</i>

35
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,141
<i>and enter
the human disease-pool.</i>

36
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,332
<i>In a special midnight-session</i>

37
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,679
<i>at the Municipal Dome,</i>

38
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:31,309
<i>Mayor Kobayashi
of Uni Prefecture</i>

39
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:32,814
<i>issues emergency orders</i>

40
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:34,796
<i>calling for
a hasty quarantine:</i>

41
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,845
<i>the expulsion and containment
of all breeds,</i>

42
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:38,734
<i>both stray and domesticated.</i>

43
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,110
<i>By official decree,</i>

44
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:42,192
<i>Trash Island
becomes an exile colony.</i>

45
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,376
<i>The Isle of Dogs.</i>

46
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,030
Respect-o.

47
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,711
<i>It's not fair to the dogs.</i>

48
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:21,005
<i>The path favored
by Mayor Kobayashi</i>

49
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:23,246
<i>is cruel and unscientific.</i>

50
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:24,493
<i>For a thousand years,</i>

51
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:25,997
<i>these resilient animals
have loved,</i>

52
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:27,438
<i>served and protected us.</i>

53
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,325
<i>Now, in their time
of greatest need,</i>

54
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:30,829
<i>we forsake them again?</i>

55
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,005
<i>A tidal-wave
of Anti-Dog hysteria</i>

56
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,214
<i>has crippled
our moral judgment.</i>

57
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:37,454
<i>Give me six months,
and I will deliver a serum.</i>

58
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:39,181
<i>I'm this close, dammit.</i>

59
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:42,830
<i>Dog-Flu will be eradicated.
Snout-fever will be defeated.</i>

60
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,140
<i>Canine Saturation
will be returned</i>

61
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,389
<i>to sustainable levels</i>

62
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,120
<i>and without mass-neutering!</i>

63
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:57,584
Whatever happened
to man's best friend?

64
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:10,542
No, no, no!

65
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,014
The crowd is calling
for the immediate ratification

66
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:13,933
and approval
of the mayor's proposal.

67
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,750
<i>As a
gesture of public solidarity,</i>

68
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:22,253
<i>Mayor Kobayashi
is calling upon</i>

69
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:23,982
<i>his Assistant Hatchet-Man,
Major-Domo,</i>

70
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,029

00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:27,149
<i>of the mayoral-household,</i>

72
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:28,526
<i>Spots Kobayashi,</i>

<i>into the possession

74
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:32,080
<i>for Canine Desaturation.</i>

75
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,478
<i>Spots will be the first dog</i>

76
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,400
<i>to be officially deported
from the city.</i>

77
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,952
<i>Six months later.</i>

78
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:40,493
<i>Nomadic packs
of once-domesticated</i>

79
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:41,997
<i>house-pets, sick and hungry,</i>

80
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,173
<i>rove the garbage canyons
and filthy ravines,</i>

81
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:45,934
<i>scrounging for scraps.</i>

82
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:47,789
<i>One hundred per cent
test positive</i>

83
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,517
<i>for the Dog-Flu germ.</i>

84
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,580
<i>Symptoms:
weight-loss, dizziness,</i>

85
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:56,237
<i>narcolepsy, insomnia,</i>

86
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:58,479
<i>and extreme/aggressive
behavior.</i>

87
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:04,973
<i>Three-quarters display signs
of early-onset Snout-fever:</i>

88
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:07,597
<i>high-temperature,
low blood-pressure,</i>

89
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,940
<i>acute moodiness</i>

90
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:11,725
<i>and spasmodic
nasal expiration.</i>

91
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:15,728
<i>The exiled dog-population
grows weaker, sadder, angrier.</i>

92
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,399
<i>Desperate.</i>

93
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,764
Hey, wait a second.

94
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,493
Before we attack each other
and tear ourselves to shreds

95
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:02,125
like a pack of maniacs,

96
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,525
let's just open the sack first
and see what's actually in it.

97
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:07,404
It might not even
be worth the trouble.

98
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,549
What do you say?
I'm not sure.

99
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:10,989
Maybe.

100
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:12,496
Alright.

101
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,613
A rancid apple core;
two worm-eaten banana peels;

102
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:18,958
a moldy rice cake;
a dried-up pickle;

103
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,749
tin of sardine bones;
a pile of broken egg-shells;

104
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:21,804
an old, smushed-up,
rotten gizzard

105
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:23,149
with maggots all over it...

106
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:24,976
Okay, it's worth it.

107
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:35,312
Get out of here
and don't come back.

108
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:42,736
Sheesh, Igor. I think
he chewed your ear off.

109
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:45,168
Hmm... Hmm.

110
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:17,229
I don't think I can stomach
any more of this garbage.

111
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:19,373
Same here.
Words out of my mouth.

112
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,324
I used to sleep
on a lamb's-wool bean-bag

113
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:22,605
next to
an electric space-heater.

114
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:25,100
That's my territory.
I'm an indoor dog.

115
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,533
I starred in 22 consecutive
Doggy-Chop commercials.

116
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:29,964
Look at me now.
I couldn't land an audition.

117
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:31,501
I was the lead mascot

118
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:33,740
for an undefeated high-school
baseball team.

119
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:35,949
I lost all my spirit.
I'm depressing.

120
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:37,805
I only ask
for what I've always had:

121
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:39,757
a balanced diet,
regular grooming,

122
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,316
and a general physical
once a year.

123
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:44,559
I think I might give up.

124
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:48,559
What, right now?
Right now.

125
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,365
There's no future
on Trash Island.

126
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,350
You heard the rumor,
right? About Buster.

127
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:55,628
Not sure.
Can you remind me?

128
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,717
Who's Buster?

129
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,029
Uh, my brother
from another litter.

130
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,428
What happened to him?
Suicided.

131
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,054
Hanged himself
by his own leash.

132
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,783
- Hmm.
- Oh, boy.

133
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:08,205
I want my master.

134
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:11,632
Ah...

135
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:15,151
You make me sick.

136
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:21,517
I've seen cats
with more balls than you dogs.

137
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,504
Stop licking your wounds!

138
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,533
You hungry?
Kill something and eat it.

139
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:29,453
You sick? Take a long nap.

140
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:31,277
You cold?
Dig a hole in the ground,

141
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,652
crawl into it,
and bury yourself.

142
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:34,989
But nobody's giving up
around here,

143
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:36,877
and don't you forget it, ever.

144
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,285
You're Rex!

145
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:39,310
You're King!

146
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:40,430
You're Duke!

147
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:41,517
You're Boss!

148
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,118
I'm Chief.

149
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,637
We're a pack of scary,
indestructible Alpha Dogs.

150
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,820
You're talking like a bunch
of house-broken... pets.

151
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:55,631
You don't understand.
Uh, how could you? You're a...

152
00:12:57,648 --> 00:13:01,840
Go ahead, say it.
I'm a stray, yeah.

153
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:32,012
How does she keep
her fur so clean?

154
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:34,700
There's no shampoo
on Trash Island.

155
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:37,485
You heard the rumor, right?
About her and Felix.

156
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:38,701
What'd they say?
Felix? No.

157
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:40,877
What happened to them?
They mated.

158
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,637
Ooh.

159
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,302
Who is Felix again?

160
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:46,700
All the ones I like:
they're never in heat.

161
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:50,062
Hey, now, that puddle-jumper's
flying crooked.

162
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:51,309
- Oh, you're right.
- Ease up.

163
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:53,199
Pull up.
He's gonna lose a wing.

164
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:09,680
Wow.

165
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:36,816
<i>Part One:
The Little Pilot."</i>

166
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,236
Small guy.
Not much meat on him.

167
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:41,357
Yeah, is he dead?

168
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:42,764
He looks dead.
I have a question.

169
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,718
Are we eating him,
or is this a rescue?

170
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,932
We don't know yet.

171
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,532
Nobody's eating
the little pilot.

172
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:49,292
Not even the dead body of him.
Dogs don't eat masters.

173
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:51,628
You're not our leader.
We all are. Let's take a vote.

174
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,285
All in favor of not eating
the little pilot, say "Aye".

175
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:55,981
- Aye.
- Nay.

176
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:07,821
First-things-first:

177
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,164
let's open his helmet

178
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,285
so he can breathe
some air if he's alive,

179
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:11,469
then see if we can pull that

180
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:12,973
hunk of
broken propeller-clutch

181
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:14,637
out of the side of his head
if it doesn't kill him.

182
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,301
- Does that sound right?
- Yeah, that's right.

183
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:17,584
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:45,231
Spots-u! Spots-u! Spots-u!

185
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,044
We get the idea.

186
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:49,965
You're looking
for your lost dog, Spots.

187
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,334
- Does anybody know him?
- Hmm. No.

188
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:53,392
Uh-uh.

189
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:00,623
Wow.

190
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:33,389
In response to questions

191
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:34,700
regarding the purported
disappearance

192
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,981
of his ward Atari,

193
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:38,157
Mayor Kobayashi offers
no comment

194
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,821
<i>and urges reporters to respect</i>

195
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:41,485
<i>the privacy of
the mayoral-household.</i>

196
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:44,269
<i>Atari, aged 12, was last seen
early yesterday morning</i>

197
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,540
<i>rolling a small airplane
onto a runway</i>

198
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,588
<i>at Megasaki Executive Airport.</i>

199
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:53,099
<i>24 hours later.</i>

200
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:15,599
I bite.

201
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:18,955
I beg your pardon.
Ignore that dog.

202
00:17:18,957 --> 00:17:20,013
He's got Snout-fever.

203
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:22,127
Just please follow us.

204
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:29,835
Now, I never met him,
but I asked around.

205
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:31,147
I understand
he made a lot of friends.

206
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:32,908
He had a very good-natured
temperament, I'm told.

207
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,189
Of course,
you would know best.

208
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:36,813
It's just a bit further
up here on the left.

209
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:38,381
Anyway, as I say,
he seemed to have been

210
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:39,787
an extremely pleasant animal.

211
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:42,828
Unfortunately, nobody could
figure out

212
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,399
how to open his dog-cage.

213
00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:53,069
<i>Three years earlier.</i>

214
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,573
<i>The sole survivor
of last week's</i>

215
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,885
<i>colossal
bullet-train disaster,</i>

216
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:57,548
<i>a young boy named Atari,</i>

217
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,021
<i>awoke from a deep-coma
early this morning</i>

218
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:01,260
<i>to learn
of his parents' tragic deaths</i>

219
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:02,668
<i>and also the intention</i>

220
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,364
<i>of his distant-uncle,
Mayor Kobayashi,</i>

221
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:05,708
<i>to personally adopt him</i>

222
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,109
<i>as ward
to the mayoral-household.</i>

223
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:09,677
<i>Upon his release
from Megasaki General,</i>

224
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,044
<i>Atari who suffered the loss
of his right kidney</i>

225
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:14,189
<i>and numerous broken bones
in the crash</i>

226
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,597

00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,294
<i>within the confines

228
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,940
<i>where he will be educated
in solitude by private tutors.</i>

229
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,667
<i>Atari has also been assigned
a security-detail</i>

230
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,076
<i>for his own protection</i>

231
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:25,964
<i>in the form of a highly
trained bodyguard-dog</i>

232
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:28,877
<i>named Spots Kobayashi.</i>

233
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,645
Um, you're my new master.

234
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:48,014
My name is Spots.
I'm at your service.

235
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:50,220
I'll be protecting
your welfare and safety

236
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:51,693
on an ongoing-basis.

237
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:54,671
In other words: I'm your dog.

238
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:16,751
Bodyguard-dog! Not pet!

239
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,221
I can hear you,
Master Atari.

240
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:52,685
I can hear you.

241
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:55,023
I can hear you.
I can hear you.

242
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:09,328
Oh, no.

243
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:12,399
You need a key.

244
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:01,775
Where'd you get that?
What? I always had this.

245
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:05,357
I stole it
off the dead skeleton.

246
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,567
Oh, no.

247
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:13,454
Hey! The wrong dog died!

248
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:16,880
The wrong dog died!

249
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:35,535
The wrong...
The wrong dog died.

250
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:39,854
He's not Spots.

251
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:46,288
Who is that?

252
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:58,412
I can't smell him.

253
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,804
This is child abuse.

254
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:03,021
Chief, you fight
the robot-dog.

255
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,396
Wait. What?

256
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:05,644
King, Duke, Boss? You attack
the three dog-catchers.

257
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:06,987
On it.
I'll guard the little pilot.

258
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:08,269
On my command. Ready?

259
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:09,323
Wait a second!

260
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:10,636
I am not gonna fight
this robot!

261
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:12,621
I'm against the little pilot,
remember?

262
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:13,868
I don't even believe
in masters.

263
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,117
You're the best in a scrap.

264
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,587
We all know that.
You like to fight.

265
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:17,644
Well, let's take a vote.

266
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:18,859
All in favor of Chief

267
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:19,884
fighting the robot-dog,
say "Aye".

268
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:21,132
- Aye.
- Nay.

269
00:26:21,134 --> 00:26:22,094
Sic 'em.

270
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:50,604
<i>My ward, Atari,</i>

271
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:52,044
<i>has been kidnapped
against his will</i>

272
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:55,627
<i>by a pack of disobedient,
contagious, infected animals.</i>

273
00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:57,900
<i>He will be rescued promptly,
returned to safety,</i>

274
00:27:57,902 --> 00:28:00,939
<i>and grounded for the duration
of his childhood years.</i>

275
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:02,188
<i>His five dog-abductors</i>

276
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,500
<i>have been identified
through the use</i>

277
00:28:03,502 --> 00:28:06,893
<i>of advanced Tooth-and-Tail
Recognition Software:</i>

278
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,651
<i>They will, of course,
be captured</i>

279
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,222
<i>and violently destroyed.</i>

280
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,813
Chief ought to
get a check-up, too.

281
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:30,735
He looks worse than anybody.

282
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,307
I wish somebody
spoke his language.

283
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:53,612
Sit-o!

284
00:28:53,614 --> 00:28:55,695
Well, I understood that.
Sit down.

285
00:28:57,807 --> 00:28:59,660
Sit-o!

286
00:28:59,662 --> 00:29:01,487
Chief! Sit!

287
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,751
I don't sit.

288
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,854
You're disobedient! Sit!

289
00:29:09,262 --> 00:29:10,735
No.

290
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:41,455
I wouldn't drink that,
if I were you.

291
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:45,420
It's full of toxic chemicals.

292
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:47,180
How do you know?

293
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:49,036
Because my sister-in-law
drank it,

294
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,478
and her tongue turned black.

295
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:53,708
Oh.

296
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,982
You're Felix's mate.

297
00:29:57,261 --> 00:29:58,667
I beg your pardon?

298
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:00,812
I mean, I think you mated

299
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:02,638
with Felix,
if I heard it right?

300
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:05,964
That's none of your business.

301
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:08,045
No, no, I don't suggest

302
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:09,293
whether it actually
happened or not.

303
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,691
I'm just saying
that I recognize you

304
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:14,062
from when I heard that rumor.

305
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:18,540
I think I'm going
to say good-night.

306
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,011
Wait, wait, wait. No.

307
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:22,285
Wait. Start over.
Who cares about Felix?

308
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,806
I'm Chief.
That's my name.

309
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:29,196
I see.

310
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:32,334
I'm introducing myself.
Who are you?

311
00:30:34,222 --> 00:30:35,532
I thought you knew
all about me.

312
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,997
No, I don't know anything.

313
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:39,213
I should've kept
my mouth shut.

314
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:40,075
It's all hearsay.

315
00:30:40,077 --> 00:30:43,055
Anyway, you're Nutmeg.

316
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:46,669
So you do know me, after all.

317
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,710
After all? Yes.

318
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,134
You a show-dog, Nutmeg?

319
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:55,372
I was bred as a show-dog.

320
00:30:55,374 --> 00:30:57,068
I was groomed
for that purpose.

321
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,252
It wasn't my choice.

322
00:30:58,254 --> 00:31:00,044
I don't consider it
my identity.

323
00:31:00,046 --> 00:31:02,796
Anyway, look around.

324
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,007
What difference
does it make now?

325
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,852
So that's a yes.

326
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:11,503
So that's a:
yes, I used to be.

327
00:31:13,326 --> 00:31:14,543
May I join you?

328
00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:22,698
You've been attacked.

329
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,579
Hmm. What else is new?
You should see the other dog.

330
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:26,892
Actually,

331
00:31:26,894 --> 00:31:28,203
I think he was made
of stainless-steel.

332
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:29,932
I couldn't get my teeth
into him.

333
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:31,917
Who is the little pilot?

334
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,870
What'd he do?
Why are they after him?

335
00:31:35,054 --> 00:31:37,358
Nobody knows.

336
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,940
You're a stray, aren't you?

337
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:47,084
Yes, I'm a stray.

338
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:50,319
But aren't we all?
In the last analysis, I mean?

339
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:54,540
Were you trained?
For competition.

340
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,043
I was a show-dog.

341
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:59,020
You know a few tricks, then.
A few.

342
00:31:59,022 --> 00:32:00,844
Can I see one?

343
00:32:00,846 --> 00:32:03,149
Maybe if I get to
know you better.

344
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:05,995
Fair enough.

345
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:07,629
It's not true, by the way.

346
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:09,582
About me and Felix.
For the record.

347
00:32:10,927 --> 00:32:13,359
I wouldn't bring puppies
into this world.

348
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,781
I don't believe in masters.
I never did.

349
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:18,027
It's against my principles.

350
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:20,747
But this is no place
for a dog like you.

351
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:24,366
You belong somewhere.
You've got papers.

352
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:26,764
Oh, I'm full-grown,
sweetheart.

353
00:32:26,766 --> 00:32:28,879
You don't have to worry
about me.

354
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,183
Good-night.

355
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:35,566
I hope I'll see you again.

356
00:32:39,086 --> 00:32:41,262
- Here's one.
- One what?

357
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,724
I'm supposed to be spinning
a nine-pound bowling-ball

358
00:32:47,726 --> 00:32:48,875
over my head at this point,

359
00:32:48,877 --> 00:32:50,958
but you just have to
imagine that part.

360
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,836
Oh.

361
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,460
I can picture it.

362
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:59,501
Will you help him?
The little pilot?

363
00:33:00,494 --> 00:33:01,930
Why should I?

364
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:04,460
Because he's
a 12-year-old boy.

365
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:06,575
Dogs love those.

366
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:11,178
<i>Spots, whoever he is,</i>

367
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,683
<i>might be alive,
and he might be dead,</i>

368
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:14,284
<i>but one thing's for sure:</i>

369
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:15,693
he's nowhere around here.

370
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:17,613
He's not in the dog-community.

371
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:19,852
There's probably another
500 Japanese hectares

372
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:21,130
of unmapped waste-land

373
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,052
on Trash Island at least.

374
00:33:23,054 --> 00:33:24,523
Where do we start?

375
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:26,859
Also,
the mental health question:

376
00:33:26,861 --> 00:33:28,267
maybe it's because of that

377
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:29,484
propeller-clutch stuck
in the side of his head

378
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:30,924
I can't say, I'm not a doctor,

379
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,092
but I think the little pilot's
got a screw loose.

380
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:35,659
Those are the cons.

381
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:37,676
You heard the rumor, right?
About the little pilot.

382
00:33:37,678 --> 00:33:39,178
Which rumor?
What is that?

383
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,677
Kobayashi is
his distant uncle.

384
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,085
He's the mayor's ward.

385
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,228
- What?
- Whoa.

386
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,179
Be that as it may,
let's look at the pros.

387
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:48,396
That boy flew here, all alone,

388
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:49,834
and crash-landed
onto this island

389
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:51,915
for one reason;
one reason only:

390
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,644
to find his dog.

391
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:55,276
To the best of my knowledge,
no other master,

392
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:56,972
not one single human master,

393
00:33:56,974 --> 00:33:58,860
has made any effort
to do that.

394
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,611
They've forgotten
all about us.

395
00:34:01,613 --> 00:34:04,779
I propose we start tomorrow,
first-light.

396
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:06,475
<i>We'll cross
the Middle Fingers.</i>

397
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,427
<i>We'll find the tugboat
on the Dune.</i>

398
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,964
<i>We'll go see Jupiter
and Oracle.</i>

399
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:11,406
<i>They'll know what to do.</i>

400
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:14,764
Let's take a vote.
All in favor say "Aye".

401
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:16,204
- Aye.
- Nay.

402
00:34:16,206 --> 00:34:17,132
Who's the nay-sayer?

403
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:19,467
- Him.
- Me.

404
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:24,491
That kid is gonna get us all
put to sleep. Euthanized.

405
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:26,607
We won't find the dog,

406
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,582
but we will die trying.

407
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,254
Not a bad way to go.
You're out-voted, anyway.

Thank you, Editor-Hiroshi.

417
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,796
You all know me.
I speak my mind,

418
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:16,427
and sometimes
that ruffles some feathers.

419
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:18,251
Please, forgive my bluntness.

420
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:20,588
Mayor Kobayashi is a crook,
and I hate him.

421
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,410
Right now,
he faces a divided congress

422
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,588
during a hotly-contested
re-election year.

423
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,468
Dogs are dying
on a miserable island.

424
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,965
Gullible masters
have been brainwashed.

425
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:32,525
The Science-Party Candidate
is being held against his will

426
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:35,691
with no recourse
to legal counsel.

427
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:38,379
Somebody is up to something.

428
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:44,493
You have
a conspiracy theory?

429
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:48,302
I have a hunch.

430
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,562
I don't print hunch.

431
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,086
Huh?

432
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,803
I'll spell it out.

433
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:59,916
I believe
Municipal Dome propaganda

434
00:35:59,918 --> 00:36:02,923
has deliberately stoked
irrational, Anti-Dog fear

435
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:05,644
and suppressed a medically
proven Dog-Flu treatment

436
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:07,626
in order to promote
a secret campaign

437
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:11,499
to turn the country against
its innocent house-pets.

438
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,549
There. I said it.

439
00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:18,094
Can you prove it?

440
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:27,723
I don't know.

441
00:36:27,725 --> 00:36:29,838

466
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:57,803
Okay, I got a question.
What's your favorite food?

467
00:37:57,805 --> 00:37:59,628
A double-portion
of Doggy-Chop from the can

468
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,356
mixed into a bowl
of broken Puppy-Snaps

469
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:02,762
with a vitamin
crushed up into it.

470
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:04,779
King's the spokes-dog
for that.

471
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:06,188
He's the Doggy-Chop dog.

472
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,307
Mmm. Used to be.

473
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:08,747
Was that
your daily meal?

474
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:10,187
Not always. My master
was a school-teacher.

475
00:38:10,189 --> 00:38:12,043
We weren't rich,
you know. You?

476
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:14,187
A center-cut Kobe
rib-eye, seared,

477
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:15,658
on the bone,
with salt and pepper.

478
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,908
Wow.

479
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,668
It was my birthday
supper. Every year.

480
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,036
Mine's hot-sausage,
yakitori-style.

481
00:38:21,038 --> 00:38:24,043
The snack vendor always
saved me one on game-days.

482
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:26,187
- Hmm. Duke?
- Ah, green-tea ice cream.

483
00:38:26,189 --> 00:38:27,532
My master had a sweet-tooth.

484
00:38:27,534 --> 00:38:29,099
I probably inherited it
from her.

485
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:32,300
You heard the rumor, right?
About Doggy-Chop.

486
00:38:32,302 --> 00:38:33,963
Remind us again.
What rumor?

487
00:38:33,965 --> 00:38:36,716
Oh, they folded.
Oh, no.

488
00:38:36,718 --> 00:38:39,308
Doggy... Doggy-Chop folded?

489
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,571
How about you, Chief?
What was your favorite food?

490
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:44,876
Me? Oh, I don't care.

491
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:47,340
Garbage, trash,
scraps of rubbish.

492
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:49,899
- I'm used to left-overs.
- Hmm.

493
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:50,924
Yeah, yeah.

494
00:38:50,926 --> 00:38:53,354
Of course,
I wasn't always a stray.

495
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:55,019
Wait. What'd you say?

496
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:57,196
I said I wasn't always
a stray.

497
00:38:57,198 --> 00:38:59,310
- Really? Since when?
- Tell us about that.

498
00:39:07,086 --> 00:39:09,835
I've been hunted by
dog-catchers all my life.

499
00:39:09,837 --> 00:39:11,147
I'm not easy to trap.

500
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:13,547
I've only got three captures
on my record

501
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:15,468
where I actually got sent
to the pound, I mean,

502
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,378
and the first two times,
I escaped within 24 hours,

503
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,812
but the third time...

504
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:22,284
I got adopted before I could

505
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:24,555
finish digging
the break-out-tunnel.

506
00:39:24,557 --> 00:39:25,771
It was a big family.

507
00:39:25,773 --> 00:39:27,948
Five kids.
Two other dogs, already.

508
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,739
They stuck me
in the back of a station-wagon

509
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:32,043
and drove me out
to the middle of the sticks.

510
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:35,660
Grass, trees, swimming pool.
Cartoons on TV.

511
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:38,603
Anyway, one morning
a week later,

512
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:40,428
the youngest boy,
his name was Toshiro,

513
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:44,076
woke me up at 6:15,
bright-eyed, wide-awake,

514
00:39:44,078 --> 00:39:48,300
and he tried to pet me.

515
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:52,140
He didn't mean anything by it.
He was just being friendly.

516
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:59,020
Apparently, I bit him so hard,
I nearly chewed his hand off.

517
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,388
Blood all over
the kitchen floor.

518
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,116
They rushed him
to the emergency room

519
00:40:03,118 --> 00:40:04,363
and I got pad-locked out

520
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:06,059
in the tool-shed
with the lights out.

521
00:40:06,061 --> 00:40:08,330
It gave me some time to think.

522
00:40:08,332 --> 00:40:11,820
What happened?
Why did I do that?

523
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:14,923
To this day, I have no idea.

524
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:17,326
I guess he scared me.

525
00:40:19,278 --> 00:40:21,455
I bite.

526
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,267
That night, an old woman,

527
00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:25,803
she must've been
the grandmother

528
00:40:25,805 --> 00:40:28,492
brought me out a bowl of some
homemade hibachi-chili.

529
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:29,579
I like to think she cooked it

530
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:31,180
for me,
personally -but who knows?

531
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:33,036
Maybe it was just
more left-overs. But...

532
00:40:33,038 --> 00:40:35,213
You've got a tick.

533
00:40:37,964 --> 00:40:40,972
Anyway, that's my favorite
food I ever ate.

534
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:43,566
The old woman made
a great bowl of chili.

535
00:40:44,557 --> 00:40:46,250
What happened after that?

536
00:40:46,252 --> 00:40:47,628
I dug my way out by morning,

537
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,195
jumped on the back
of a dump-truck,

538
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,307
and hitched back to Megasaki.

539
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:54,218
I was always a street-dog,
let's face it.

540
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:07,214
Somebody's stalking us.

541
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:25,706
<i>As you know, we all hate dogs.</i>

542
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:27,115
<i>Chairman Fujimoto-san,</i>

543
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,684
<i>President of
Kobayashi Pharmaceutical.</i>

544
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,027
<i>You secretly introduced</i>

545
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,499
<i>mega-quantities
of infected fleas</i>

546
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:32,844
<i>and contagious tick-larvae</i>

547
00:41:32,846 --> 00:41:34,475
<i>into a metropolitan
city center,</i>

548
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:37,547
<i>creating an unprecedented
animal-disease out-break.</i>

549
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:38,603
<i>Thank you.</i>

550
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:40,172
<i>General Yamatachi-san,</i>

551
00:41:40,174 --> 00:41:42,092
<i>Commander of the Megasaki
Municipal Task force.</i>

552
00:41:42,094 --> 00:41:45,867
<i>You oversaw the deportation
of over 750,000 caged-animals</i>

553
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:49,068
<i>to a nearly uninhabitable
off-shore refuse-center.</i>

554
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,188
<i>Good work.</i>

555
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,755
<i>Supervisor Kitano-san,</i>

556
00:41:51,757 --> 00:41:53,388
<i>Director
of Kobayashi Robotics.</i>

557
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,338
<i>You developed the most
promising artificial life-form</i>

558
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,164
<i>in the history
of corporate-technology-</i>

559
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,436
<i>and a powerful new weapon,
to boot.</i>

560
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:00,652
<i>Well done.</i>

561
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:01,964
<i>Yakuza Nakamura-san,</i>

562
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:03,531
<i>Head of
the Clenched-Fist Gang.</i>

563
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:05,355
<i>You eliminated
all Pro-Dog opposition</i>

564
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,827
<i>through the use of bribery,</i>

565
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:09,323
<i>extortion, intimidation,
and violent force.</i>

566
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:12,588
<i>My compliments.</i>

567
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,820
<i>Brains have been washed.
Wheels have been greased.</i>

568
00:42:15,822 --> 00:42:17,195
<i>Fear has been mongered.</i>

569
00:42:17,197 --> 00:42:18,636
<i>Now we prepare
for the final stage</i>

570
00:42:18,638 --> 00:42:20,139
<i>of our conspiracy-theory:</i>

571
00:42:20,141 --> 00:42:21,260
<i>the permanent end</i>

572
00:42:21,262 --> 00:42:23,565
<i>to the Canine
Saturation-crisis.</i>

573
00:42:32,749 --> 00:42:35,787
<i>We believe we've
recovered a viable DNA sample</i>

574
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:39,114
<i>from this article
of damaged aviation equipment.</i>

575
00:42:39,116 --> 00:42:40,395
<i>We're going to check it
right now</i>

576
00:42:40,397 --> 00:42:42,190
<i>if you care to observe.</i>

577
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,772
We call upon
dog-lovers everywhere

578
00:43:05,774 --> 00:43:07,979
to harken
to this transmission:

579
00:43:09,773 --> 00:43:11,211
May-day! May-day!

580
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,907
Unscheduled Junior Turbo-Prop

581
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:14,922
in severe distress
over Sapporo River.

582
00:43:14,924 --> 00:43:16,522
Engine-failure, and-

583
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:18,027
-detachment of left wing.

584
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,971
Will attempt emergency-landing
on Trash Island coast.

585
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,730
Please, make note
of the following:

586
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:24,587
<i>to my security-detail /
bodyguard-dog,</i>

587
00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:26,474
<i>Spots Kobayashi,
if still living,</i>

588
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:29,515
<i>I leave
all my worldly possessions.</i>

589
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:31,914
<i>If Spots has preceded me
into the next life,</i>

590
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:33,547
<i>I ask that everything,</i>

591
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:35,979
<i>including my own bones
and Spots' carcass,</i>

592
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:38,730
<i>be burned
in a crematory furnace,</i>

593
00:43:38,732 --> 00:43:41,130
<i>with our ashes scattered
to the four-winds.</i>

594
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:44,362
<i>It will not amount to much
pollution in this sad land.</i>

595
00:43:44,364 --> 00:43:47,980
<i>If I survive,
ignore this message.</i>

596
00:43:47,982 --> 00:43:50,860
<i>I've gone to find my dog.</i>

597
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:54,221
Young masters
of Megasaki: unite!

598
00:44:04,365 --> 00:44:05,932
Turpentine brandy.

599
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:09,580
It cools the head
and warms the dog-bones.

600
00:44:11,725 --> 00:44:13,740
It may snow tonight.

601
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:16,747
Really? Thank you
very much. Wow.

602
00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:19,147
To whom it may concern.

603
00:44:19,149 --> 00:44:22,955
- She sees the future.
- No.

604
00:44:22,957 --> 00:44:24,748
She understands T.V.

605
00:44:29,356 --> 00:44:32,525
You seek a dog named Spots.

606
00:44:36,557 --> 00:44:39,181
- Dog-Zero.
- Dog-Zero.

607
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,819
As you know, most of
the animals on this island

608
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:45,420
come from human homes

609
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:47,148
with domesticated
back-grounds.

610
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,826
However, a small population
of savage, aboriginal dogs

611
00:44:50,828 --> 00:44:52,075
have been scavenging

612
00:44:52,077 --> 00:44:53,290
the Metropolitan
Dumping-Grounds

613
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:54,732
for nearly a decade.

614
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,451
The graffiti on this wall
depicts the story.

615
00:44:57,453 --> 00:44:59,947
They were born into captivity
on the ends of the fringes

616
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:01,610
of the most distant reaches
of the island.

617
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:04,715
They endured
great suffering and cruelty

618
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:06,986
at the hands
of their former masters.

619
00:45:06,988 --> 00:45:10,059
Finally, in the wake of
an Act of God, they escaped-

620
00:45:10,061 --> 00:45:12,747
to a harsh
and desperate freedom.

621
00:45:12,749 --> 00:45:15,467
<i>Some say they died away
over the subsequent years,</i>

622
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:16,972
<i>starving and forgotten.</i>

623
00:45:16,974 --> 00:45:18,699
<i>Some say they swam
to the mainland,</i>

624
00:45:18,701 --> 00:45:22,410
<i>but this seems unlikely.
Too far to dog-paddle.</i>

625
00:45:22,412 --> 00:45:24,236
<i>Some say
they're still with us,</i>

626
00:45:24,238 --> 00:45:28,076
<i>in the Far-away Cuticles,
beyond the Middle Fingers.</i>

627
00:45:28,078 --> 00:45:30,988
We know the animal you seek.

628
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,451
<i>He has appeared
in Oracle's visions.</i>

629
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,933
A prophecy suggests itself:

630
00:45:39,468 --> 00:45:42,284
Spots, if he's alive,
may very well be living,

631
00:45:42,286 --> 00:45:44,842
even at this moment,
as a captive prisoner

632
00:45:44,844 --> 00:45:48,590
abducted into the company
of these wild, savage dogs.

633
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,118
Oracle, what do you think?

634
00:45:53,326 --> 00:45:55,054
What?

635
00:45:56,717 --> 00:46:00,330
Continue your journey.
Have faith in your cause.

636
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:02,764
Luck and good fortune
be unto you.

637
00:46:05,932 --> 00:46:09,259
You heard the rumor, right?
About these aboriginal dogs.

638
00:46:09,261 --> 00:46:11,691
- Remind me again.
- What's the rumor?

639
00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:13,514
Uh, they're cannibals.

640
00:46:13,516 --> 00:46:16,907
So you're telling me they're
going to want to eat us?

641
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:19,022
Well, they're cannibals.

642
00:48:51,373 --> 00:48:53,099
We're approaching
the end of Old Trash Island.

643
00:48:53,101 --> 00:48:56,170
To the west: the Sapporo River
and Megasaki City.

644
00:48:56,172 --> 00:48:57,804
To the east: the open-sea.

645
00:48:57,806 --> 00:48:59,306
To the north: a long, rickety

646
00:48:59,308 --> 00:49:01,004
cause-way
over a noxious sludge-marsh

647
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:02,764
leading to
a radio-active land-fill

648
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:04,331
polluted by toxic
chemical-garbage.

649
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:05,834
- That's our destination.
- Great.

650
00:49:05,836 --> 00:49:07,210
Got it.
Get ready to jump.

651
00:49:07,212 --> 00:49:08,811
Atari, I'm going to drag you
overboard with my teeth,

652
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:09,995
since you can't understand
the plan.

653
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:11,562
After that,
we're back on foot.

654
00:49:11,564 --> 00:49:12,875
The next stage...

655
00:49:12,877 --> 00:49:13,834
Where'd they...

656
00:49:13,836 --> 00:49:15,210
Where'd they go?

657
00:49:15,212 --> 00:49:16,233
What are they doing
over there?

658
00:49:16,235 --> 00:49:17,516
How did this happen?

659
00:49:17,518 --> 00:49:19,307
What's going on
with this contraption?

660
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:21,258
If we get separated,
which we are:

661
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,107
rendez-vous at the cause-way!

662
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:26,731
You're not our leader!
What?

663
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:28,842
You're not our leader!
We all are!

664
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:30,538
Let's take a vote!

665
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,898
All in favor of my plan,

666
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,915
which is to rendez-vous
at the cause-way...

667
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:13,198
Let's go.

668
00:50:22,668 --> 00:50:24,650
No, you can't ride
the Pagoda-Slide.

669
00:50:24,652 --> 00:50:27,469
You're below the safety-limit,
anyway. Let's go.

670
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,651
We made an emergency plan,

671
00:50:32,653 --> 00:50:34,731
even if we didn't get to vote
and agree to it yet:

672
00:50:34,733 --> 00:50:37,130
rendez-vous at the cause-way
to the Far-away Cuticles,

673
00:50:37,132 --> 00:50:38,282
and go find your dog.

674
00:50:38,284 --> 00:50:40,042
Maybe everybody else
just got crushed,

675
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:41,706
compacted, and incinerated-

676
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,821
but we're going to be there.
Let's go.

677
00:50:50,861 --> 00:50:52,332
Don't.

678
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,053
Repeat:

679
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,508
don't.

680
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:04,042
I am not your pet.
I never liked you.

681
00:51:04,044 --> 00:51:06,634
I don't care about you.
I won't wait for you.

682
00:51:06,636 --> 00:51:08,749
I bite.

683
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,782
Good luck.

684
00:51:53,965 --> 00:51:56,906
Jerks. Come here.
Oh, do this. Do that.

685
00:51:56,908 --> 00:51:59,210
Our Masters. I'll do what I...

686
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:02,573
Hmm...

687
00:52:42,669 --> 00:52:44,362
I suppose
if it was working right,

688
00:52:44,364 --> 00:52:45,773
we'd be dead already.

689
00:53:02,765 --> 00:53:04,941
Don't ask me
to fetch that stick.

690
00:53:09,324 --> 00:53:10,732
Fetch-i!

691
00:53:16,141 --> 00:53:17,578
Fetch-i!

692
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,229
I'm telling you:
I don't fetch.

693
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:29,130
Fetch-i!

694
00:53:29,132 --> 00:53:32,331
I'm not doing this
because you commanded me to.

695
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:35,756
I'm doing it-
because I feel sorry for you.

696
00:53:48,587 --> 00:53:50,509
Good boy.

697
00:54:27,339 --> 00:54:28,649
Where'd you get that dog?

698
00:54:28,651 --> 00:54:31,081
He looks like me
with a pink nose.

699
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:35,658
I come from a nine-dog litter,
but they drowned the sisters.

700
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,908
We're not a rare breed:

701
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,572
short-haired-Oceanic-
speckled-ear/

702
00:54:38,574 --> 00:54:39,819
sport-hound-mix.

703
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:42,155
I'm getting confused now.

704
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:44,237
My belly feels funny.

705
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:58,990
Biscuit-o.

706
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:05,227
I can't accept that.
It's for your dog.

707
00:55:09,164 --> 00:55:11,530
I've never been offered
a Puppy-Snap in my life.

708
00:55:11,532 --> 00:55:13,867
I don't even know
what they taste like.

709
00:55:13,869 --> 00:55:15,214
Okay, I'll try it.

710
00:55:17,068 --> 00:55:20,585
Crunchy. Salty.

711
00:55:20,587 --> 00:55:22,893
Supposedly, it cleans
your teeth.

712
00:55:24,173 --> 00:55:26,285
This is my new favorite food.

713
00:55:27,756 --> 00:55:29,229
Thank you.

726
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,714
Mayor Kobayashi,

727
00:56:48,716 --> 00:56:50,602
elected leader
of Megasaki City.

728
00:56:50,604 --> 00:56:53,258
For 150 years,
you and your ancestors,

729
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,339
known as
the Kobayashi Dynasty,

730
00:56:55,341 --> 00:56:57,161
a procession of
dog-hating thugs,

731
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,530
stooges, felons,
and their criminal underlings,

732
00:56:59,532 --> 00:57:01,545
have betrayed and deceived
the citizens

733
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:03,626
of Uni Prefecture.

734
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,060
You make me so mad!

735
00:57:07,244 --> 00:57:08,587
Professor Watanabe,

736
00:57:08,589 --> 00:57:10,827
Science-Party Candidate,
deceased.

737
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:12,746
The wasabi in your blood
showed poison-levels

738
00:57:12,748 --> 00:57:15,306
in excess of ten times
the maximum dosage required

739
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:17,290
to stop the heart of a whale.

740
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:20,938
Why'd you do it?

741
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:24,939
Atari Kobayashi, adopted ward
to the mayoral-household.

742
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:29,289
You heroically hi-jacked
a Junior Turbo-Prop XJ750

743
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:31,948
and flew it to the island...

744
00:57:48,908 --> 00:57:50,283
Atari.

745
00:57:50,285 --> 00:57:51,978
You heroically,
as I was saying,

746
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,851
stole the little airplane,
because of your dog and...

747
00:57:55,853 --> 00:57:58,797
I lost my train of thought.

748
00:57:59,884 --> 00:58:01,995
Dammit!

749
00:58:01,997 --> 00:58:03,917
I've got a crush on you.

750
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:08,333
<i>Part Three:
"The Rendez-Vous."</i>

751
00:58:33,099 --> 00:58:36,938
Rex! King! Duke! Boss!
You made it!

752
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,394
What happened to you?
I took a bath.

753
00:58:40,396 --> 00:58:43,565
What? He's got soap?
Just a little.

754
00:58:44,235 --> 00:58:45,578
You're too fluffy.

755
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,690
- We played fetch.
- With a stick?

756
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:49,707
With a hunk
of rubber radiator-tubing.

757
00:58:49,709 --> 00:58:51,753
And you brought it back
to him?

758
00:58:51,755 --> 00:58:53,322
Yeah.

759
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:54,605
He's a good boy.

760
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,282
Don't you tell me that!

761
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,914
I'm the one
that tried to make you

762
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:01,387
be loyal to him,
in the first place.

763
00:59:01,389 --> 00:59:03,243
Stop. Stop!
This is the rendezvous.

764
00:59:03,245 --> 00:59:05,131
Where's that trash-tram
taking you?

765
00:59:05,133 --> 00:59:06,987
You think we booked this ride
through a travel agent?

766
00:59:06,989 --> 00:59:08,203
We were fighting for our lives

767
00:59:08,205 --> 00:59:09,770
in a high-velocity
trash-processor

768
00:59:09,772 --> 00:59:11,146
while you were getting
scrubbed and brushed.

769
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:12,779
- Jump!
- Where?

770
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:14,954
- Here!
- When?

771
00:59:14,956 --> 00:59:16,969
- Now!
- Why?

772
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:19,050
What?
Let's take a vote.

773
00:59:19,052 --> 00:59:21,164
All in favor of jump...

774
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,092
Who's that?

775
00:59:37,548 --> 00:59:39,500
I can't smell him.

776
01:00:20,013 --> 01:00:21,514
<i>Come in.</i>

777
01:00:21,516 --> 01:00:22,505
<i>Master Atari...
Can you hear me?</i>

778
01:00:22,507 --> 01:00:23,693
Huh?

779
01:00:45,004 --> 01:00:46,988
That dog's real.

780
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:55,018
What's that thing
in your ear for?

781
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,331
Are you hard of hearing?

782
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,674
You can't be. Um...

783
01:00:57,676 --> 01:00:59,882
Bodyguard-dogs have to have
20/30-Auditory

784
01:00:59,884 --> 01:01:01,194
just to be certified.

785
01:01:01,196 --> 01:01:02,793
No, the ear-piece
is how I receive

786
01:01:02,795 --> 01:01:04,330
my commands and instructions
and so on.

787
01:01:04,332 --> 01:01:07,049
Obviously, I'm privy to
certain sensitive information

788
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:08,586
due to my position
in the mayoral-household

789
01:01:08,588 --> 01:01:10,121
at Brick Mansion.

790
01:01:10,123 --> 01:01:11,530
Oh, so you mean

791
01:01:11,532 --> 01:01:13,354
somebody could be talking
to you right now?

792
01:01:13,356 --> 01:01:17,258
Well, the range is only about
75 feet or so, I guess, so...

793
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,441
Battery's probably dead,
anyway.

794
01:01:18,443 --> 01:01:19,819
I got a question for you.

795
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:21,899
How much money
do you think the mayor makes?

796
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:23,211
I can't tell you that.

797
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:25,258
That's highly confidential.

798
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,593
Um, anyway, I'm not
the mayor's accountant's dog.

799
01:01:27,595 --> 01:01:28,681
That's Butterscotch,

800
01:01:28,683 --> 01:01:29,961
and she got crushed

801
01:01:29,963 --> 01:01:31,466
in a glass compactor
the day before yesterday.

802
01:01:31,468 --> 01:01:34,570
No, my duties
are, uh, focused entirely

803
01:01:34,572 --> 01:01:36,906
on the protection
of the mayor's ward, Atari.

804
01:01:36,908 --> 01:01:38,569
I'm not supposed
to be his friend,

805
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:40,235
but I love him very much,

806
01:01:40,237 --> 01:01:42,219
but that's a private matter.

807
01:01:42,221 --> 01:01:43,722
Um, the only reason
I even said that

808
01:01:43,724 --> 01:01:46,281
was because we're all probably
going to die out here

809
01:01:46,283 --> 01:01:49,610
and I'll never see him again.

810
01:01:53,515 --> 01:01:54,890
That's a tough break.

811
01:01:54,892 --> 01:01:56,714
Well, good luck to you

812
01:01:56,716 --> 01:01:58,700
and watch out
for the cannibal-dogs.

813
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:01,610
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

814
01:02:01,612 --> 01:02:03,754
- What?
- What?

815
01:02:03,756 --> 01:02:06,952
Watch out for the...?
The cannibal-dogs.

816
01:02:06,954 --> 01:02:10,346
They are dogs that eat dogs.
Start over and repeat again.

817
01:02:10,348 --> 01:02:12,587
You know what?
Don't even worry about that.

818
01:02:12,589 --> 01:02:13,835
I just heard there might be

819
01:02:13,837 --> 01:02:15,466
some wild, aboriginal,
cannibal-dogs

820
01:02:15,468 --> 01:02:16,553
in the area, you know,

821
01:02:16,555 --> 01:02:17,705
but I wouldn't worry
because you're

822
01:02:17,707 --> 01:02:19,529
in an extra-security
lock cell.

823
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:20,715
Look at it that way.

824
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:22,730
You're probably safer
than I am.

825
01:02:22,732 --> 01:02:24,844
Except from thirst
and starvation.

826
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:01,098
It's got an extra-security
lock on it.

827
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,829
You'll never get it open.

828
01:03:36,492 --> 01:03:38,541
Are you going to eat me now?

829
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:41,385
What did you say?

830
01:03:41,387 --> 01:03:43,114
Are you going to eat me now?

831
01:03:43,116 --> 01:03:44,522
I heard
you were cannibal-dogs.

832
01:03:44,524 --> 01:03:46,922
Be notified: I'll be compelled
to defend myself

833
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:49,389
with all means at my disposal.

834
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,227
Hmm.

835
01:03:57,229 --> 01:04:00,365
Who told you that dirty lie?

836
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,746
We resorted to cannibalism
on one occasion,

837
01:04:08,748 --> 01:04:09,930
many months ago,

838
01:04:09,932 --> 01:04:11,593
as a desperate
survival instinct.

839
01:04:11,595 --> 01:04:14,121
We ate one single dog.

840
01:04:14,123 --> 01:04:15,723
His name was Fuzzball,

841
01:04:15,725 --> 01:04:17,161
and he was the leader
of our pack,

842
01:04:17,163 --> 01:04:19,274
and he was already in a coma
from starvation,

843
01:04:19,276 --> 01:04:24,909
- so we put him out of his...
- his...

844
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:30,797
His misery and...

845
01:04:32,557 --> 01:04:34,028
and...

846
01:04:36,044 --> 01:04:38,156
consumed him.

847
01:04:47,531 --> 01:04:49,353
We would have dropped dead
in a week or less

848
01:04:49,355 --> 01:04:50,665
without that nourishment.

849
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:53,612
We were dying.
Do you judge us for that?

850
01:04:54,187 --> 01:04:55,690
Shame on you!

851
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:56,874
We only brought you here

852
01:04:56,876 --> 01:04:58,573
in the first place
to help you.

853
01:05:04,908 --> 01:05:06,794
We've got a Master Pass-Key!

854
01:05:06,796 --> 01:05:08,908
Open his cage.

855
01:05:22,413 --> 01:05:24,588
Fuzzball was his best friend.

856
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,689
Oh, dear.
Uh, I think I offended him.

857
01:05:35,691 --> 01:05:39,658
I'm truly sorry.
I had no idea.

858
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,793
What is this place?
How long have you been here?

859
01:05:42,795 --> 01:05:45,482
I can see
you've been mistreated.

860
01:05:49,452 --> 01:05:51,372
Are you okay?

861
01:05:52,972 --> 01:05:56,969
My name is Spots.
Spots Kobayashi.

862
01:05:56,971 --> 01:05:59,660
How can I be of service
to you?

863
01:06:01,804 --> 01:06:04,299
Master Atari-san,
can you hear me?

864
01:06:04,301 --> 01:06:05,994
Can you hear me, Master Atari?

865
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:07,241
Spots-u?

866
01:06:07,243 --> 01:06:08,393
You're not safe here!

867
01:06:08,395 --> 01:06:09,578
You shouldn't have
come for me!

868
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,209
I can't
protect you efficiently

869
01:06:11,211 --> 01:06:12,460
under these conditions!

870
01:06:22,763 --> 01:06:24,043
Spots-u!

871
01:06:25,484 --> 01:06:26,957
<i>Here I come.</i>

872
01:06:43,052 --> 01:06:44,013
Sic-'em!

873
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,973
<i>Follow me!</i>

874
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,185
All in favor of kicking
Chief out of the pack

875
01:07:02,187 --> 01:07:04,427
and never speaking
to him again, say "Aye".

876
01:07:04,429 --> 01:07:06,185
Aye!

877
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:11,466
How did you do that?
Secret tooth! Military issue!

878
01:07:11,468 --> 01:07:13,448
Technically, I could do it
37 more times,

879
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,009
but I wouldn't be able
to chew my meat!

880
01:07:16,011 --> 01:07:18,985
I assume you're Spots!
We've been looking for you.

881
01:07:26,763 --> 01:07:28,233
Master Atari-san,

882
01:07:28,235 --> 01:07:30,282
I swore an oath when I assumed
the responsibilities

883
01:07:30,284 --> 01:07:32,873
of official bodyguard-dog
to the mayoral-household!

884
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:34,666
I could never be persuaded
to break that vow

885
01:07:34,668 --> 01:07:36,170
for any reason whatsoever!

886
01:07:36,172 --> 01:07:37,417
I'll always be loyal to you

887
01:07:37,419 --> 01:07:38,953
as my only
and unconditional master!

888
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:41,449
But circumstances
have radically changed for me

889
01:07:41,451 --> 01:07:43,626
and all the pets
of Megasaki City!

890
01:07:43,628 --> 01:07:45,833
I have new obligations
which I never anticipated!

891
01:07:45,835 --> 01:07:48,042
I've become the leader
of a tribe of outcasts

892
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:49,737
who depend on me
for their survival,

893
01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:52,937
and I'm going to be a father!

894
01:07:52,939 --> 01:07:55,115
With deepest sadness
and humility:

895
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:58,154
I must ask you to relieve me
of the duties of my position,

896
01:07:58,156 --> 01:08:00,009
effective immediately.

897
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:02,058
You son of a bitch.

898
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,457
If we don't drown, I'm going
to strangle you myself.

899
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:06,409
I don't care
how many exploding teeth

900
01:08:06,411 --> 01:08:07,849
you try to spit-out at me.

901
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:09,706
Do you have any idea

902
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:11,178
what that little pilot
just went through

903
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,681
to try to rescue you?

904
01:08:12,683 --> 01:08:13,900
How dare you?

905
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,306
- You're a stray.
- Yeah, so what?

906
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:20,681
What's your name?

907
01:08:20,683 --> 01:08:22,122
Who cares?

908
01:08:22,124 --> 01:08:24,874
You're from central Megasaki.
I can tell by the accent.

909
01:08:24,876 --> 01:08:27,914
You're a short-haired-Oceanic-
speckle-ear/sport-hound-mix.

910
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:29,323
You were born in a storm-sewer

911
01:08:29,325 --> 01:08:32,106
on Bamboo-shoot Holiday
six years ago today.

912
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,417
Do you know me?

913
01:08:33,419 --> 01:08:36,521
I... I don't... I don't know.

914
01:08:36,523 --> 01:08:39,050
I'm your older brother
by five minutes.

915
01:08:39,052 --> 01:08:41,228
It's been a long time, Chief.

916
01:08:42,731 --> 01:08:45,644
Was... Was I the runt?

917
01:08:46,796 --> 01:08:48,716
Not anymore.

918
01:08:57,995 --> 01:08:59,338
<i>Security-camera footage</i>

919
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:00,873
<i>confirms initial-reports</i>

920
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:03,208
<i>of the deaths of mayoral-ward
Atari Kobayashi</i>

921
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:05,417
and his five dog-abductors
this afternoon

922
01:09:05,419 --> 01:09:06,730
in a sluice channel

923
01:09:06,732 --> 01:09:08,778
at the threshold
of the Far-Away Cuticles.

924
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:11,434
A statement from Major-Domo,
live at Brick Mansion:

925
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,329
The life
of a promising young orphan

926
01:09:16,331 --> 01:09:18,217
has been cut short
before its prime.

927
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:20,554
This is a distant-uncle's
worst nightmare.

928
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:24,041
Mayor Kobayashi asks for your
prayers, your condolences

929
01:09:24,043 --> 01:09:25,577
and your support
for the diligent men and women

930
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:28,202
of the Municipal Task Force
Dog-Catchers Division:

931
01:09:28,204 --> 01:09:30,954
we salute you for your bravery
and your ongoing commitment

932
01:09:30,956 --> 01:09:34,060
to the continuing punishment
of all bad-dogs.

933
01:09:40,587 --> 01:09:42,473
Originally,
before the volcano erupted

934
01:09:42,475 --> 01:09:43,914
and an earthquake
triggered the tsunami

935
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:45,096
which obliterated
the facility,

936
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,410
there were over 250

937
01:09:46,412 --> 01:09:48,137
incarcerated animals
here on the premises

938
01:09:48,139 --> 01:09:50,377
being experimented on
against their will.

939
01:09:50,379 --> 01:09:52,234
If you look closely, you may
notice some of these dogs

940
01:09:52,236 --> 01:09:55,692
still bear scars and markings
from the research and abuse.

941
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,401
Actually, it's pretty obvious.

942
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:00,809
This is my mate, Peppermint.

943
01:10:00,811 --> 01:10:02,410
She's pregnant
with our first litter.

944
01:10:02,412 --> 01:10:04,106
She was due a week ago.

945
01:10:07,275 --> 01:10:08,618
Anyway,

946
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,057
the survivors of the disaster
learned to cultiv...

947
01:10:10,059 --> 01:10:11,881
What's he got there?
What's he got there?

948
01:10:11,883 --> 01:10:15,529
Biscuit-o. Biscuit-o.
Biscuit-o.

949
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:17,610
Puppy-Snaps.

950
01:10:17,612 --> 01:10:20,298
I heard they don't even
make them anymore.

951
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,642
You heard the rumor, right?

952
01:10:21,644 --> 01:10:22,793
About Kobayashi
Pharmaceutical.

953
01:10:22,795 --> 01:10:24,426
I never heard it.
What rumor?

954
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,345
They invented Dog-Flu.

955
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,874
- No.
- Of course.

956
01:10:28,876 --> 01:10:30,121
That makes sense.

957
01:10:30,123 --> 01:10:31,433
Where do you get
all these rumors?

958
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:32,937
I mean,
who tells them to you?

959
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:34,057
I don't know. Anybody.

960
01:10:34,059 --> 01:10:36,041
Dogs talk, and I listen.
Always have.

961
01:10:36,043 --> 01:10:37,865
I, uh, love gossip.

962
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,084
Spots!

963
01:10:40,492 --> 01:10:43,337
The black owl has a message.

964
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:49,961
He's come from all the way
across the island.

965
01:10:49,963 --> 01:10:51,945
Get him a cup
of sewer-water, Chico.

966
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,834
Mmm-hmm.

967
01:10:53,836 --> 01:10:55,306
Mmm-hmm.

968
01:10:55,308 --> 01:10:56,777
Yes. We understand.

969
01:10:56,779 --> 01:10:58,826
He has news from the
Metropolitan Dumping-Grounds.

970
01:10:58,828 --> 01:11:02,409
Metropolitan...
Shh! Quiet, please.

971
01:11:02,411 --> 01:11:06,091
We're listening, owl.
Tell us your message.

972
01:11:10,572 --> 01:11:12,553
He's going to poison us.

973
01:11:12,555 --> 01:11:13,993
Re-election Night:

974
01:11:13,995 --> 01:11:16,393
at the moment Mayor Kobayashi
is re-inaugurated,

975
01:11:16,395 --> 01:11:17,738
he'll give the order,

976
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,754
and the extermination-process
will begin.

977
01:11:19,756 --> 01:11:22,058
<i>Oracle saw the plan
in her visions.</i>

978
01:11:24,427 --> 01:11:25,641
<i>If the voters choose me again</i>

01:11:25,643 --> 01:11:27,017
<i>on Re-Election Night,</i>

980
01:11:27,019 --> 01:11:28,841

<i>It may be too late, already;</i>

984
01:11:37,132 --> 01:11:38,666
<i>but, if the black owl
reaches you</i>

985
01:11:38,668 --> 01:11:40,204
<i>with this message in time:</i>

986
01:11:41,707 --> 01:11:45,066
Go to Megasaki City.
Find our masters.

987
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:48,650
Appeal to the people.
Stop the mayor.

988
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:50,252
Save us.

989
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:57,546
We're crossing
the river tonight.

990
01:11:57,548 --> 01:11:59,596
Begin preparations
immediately.

991
01:12:07,979 --> 01:12:10,152
You'll meet a bitch
named Nutmeg.

992
01:12:10,154 --> 01:12:14,154
Tell her Chief says:
I'll see you in Megasaki.

993
01:13:40,843 --> 01:13:41,929
Hmm.

994
01:13:41,931 --> 01:13:44,488
Beautiful night.

995
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:47,276
Peppermint's in labor.
Oh.

996
01:13:48,459 --> 01:13:50,825
Come sit beside me.

997
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:54,344
It's okay.

998
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:57,257
Master Atari, are you willing
to accept my brother Chief

999
01:13:57,259 --> 01:13:59,688
as new bodyguard-dog
in personal service to you,

1000
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:01,932
former ward
to the mayoral-household?

1001
01:14:21,516 --> 01:14:23,625
Chief, are you willing
to accept

1002
01:14:23,627 --> 01:14:25,418
Atari as your direct master,

1003
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:28,009
to serve and protect
his safety and welfare

1004
01:14:28,011 --> 01:14:30,732
with all courage, loyalty
and friendship?

1005
01:14:34,955 --> 01:14:37,067
I can do that.

1006
01:14:37,547 --> 01:14:39,019
Good.

1007
01:15:41,322 --> 01:15:43,436
Chocolate milk, cold.

Tracy Walker, Megasaki
Senior High, Daily-Manifesto.

1009
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,298
Are you Professor Watanabe's

1010
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,956
former Assistant-Scientist,
Yoko-ono-san?

1011
01:16:09,674 --> 01:16:11,595
Do I have it?

1012
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:16,716
Too late.

1013
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,953
Do I have it?

1014
01:16:22,955 --> 01:16:24,297
Too late.

1015
01:16:25,515 --> 01:16:27,628
Nobody care.

1016
01:16:30,348 --> 01:16:32,297
Do I have it?
Do I have the story?

1017
01:16:32,299 --> 01:16:33,929
Yes or no? On the record!

1018
01:16:33,931 --> 01:16:35,369
I am sorry for your loss,

1019
01:16:35,371 --> 01:16:37,929
but we both know:
that was no suicide!

1020
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:41,674
I need to prove
my conspiracy-theory!

1021
01:16:41,676 --> 01:16:46,184
Ben is dead.
No future on Trash Island.

1022
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:48,107
I am failure.

1023
01:16:50,571 --> 01:16:53,164
Pull yourself together
and act like a scientist!

1024
01:16:57,258 --> 01:17:00,300
Professor Watanabe
never gave up.

1025
01:17:11,403 --> 01:17:13,674
Is this... Is this the serum?

1026
01:17:13,676 --> 01:17:16,329
The Dog-Flu cure?
The Snout-fever treatment?

1027
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:19,112
The end of the Canine
Saturation-crisis?

1028
01:17:19,114 --> 01:17:21,227
Last dose.

1029
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:25,419
Tracy:

1030
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:27,788

- Not fair!
- To dogs!

1036
01:17:47,147 --> 01:17:49,930
There will never be a place
for Dog-Flu in Megasaki City.

1037
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:51,176
There will never be room

1038

01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:47,404
<i>and we demand a re-count!</i>

1051
01:18:52,587 --> 01:18:54,409
Respect-o.

1052
01:18:54,411 --> 01:18:55,624
The mayor is allowing

1053
01:18:55,626 --> 01:18:57,738
the unauthorized
Pro-Dog student-protestors

1054
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:00,137
a platform to voice
their dissenting beliefs!

1055
01:19:00,139 --> 01:19:02,024
<i>Mayor Kobayashi
has dog's-blood</i>

1056
01:19:02,026 --> 01:19:04,107
<i>on his hands! You all do!</i>

1057
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,857
<i>Atari was a hero.</i>

1058
01:19:06,859 --> 01:19:09,321
<i>Professor Watanabe
was murdered.</i>

1059
01:19:09,323 --> 01:19:10,987
The serum works!

1060
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:15,595
<i>The mayor is a crook,
and I hate him.</i>

1061
01:19:20,587 --> 01:19:22,250
This small minority
of dog-lovers

1062
01:19:22,252 --> 01:19:24,392
has been sent by overseas
special-interest groups

1063
01:19:24,394 --> 01:19:27,145
to agitate disorder
and incite anarchy.

1064
01:19:27,147 --> 01:19:29,096
I hereby cancel and nullify

1065
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:30,505
Foreign-exchange
student Walker's

1066
01:19:30,507 --> 01:19:31,816
<i>senior high school study-visa.</i>

1067
01:19:31,818 --> 01:19:34,152
<i>She will be expelled
from class,</i>

1068
01:19:34,154 --> 01:19:35,912
<i>stripped of
her course-credits,</i>

1069
01:19:35,914 --> 01:19:37,482
<i>and formally deported
on the next direct-flight</i>

1070
01:19:37,484 --> 01:19:38,988
<i>back to Cincinnati, Ohio.</i>
Oh. Hmm.

1071
01:19:45,099 --> 01:19:47,081
Mayor Kobayashi
has directed Major-Domo

1072
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:49,067
to bring him the red button.

1073
01:20:03,819 --> 01:20:05,547
Nutmeg!

1074
01:20:57,034 --> 01:21:00,200
Holy smokes!
My lungs feel clear.

1075
01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:02,441
My equilibrium feels balanced.

1076
01:21:02,443 --> 01:21:06,218
My vision is sharp as a tack
for the first time in months.

1077
01:21:09,386 --> 01:21:12,968
Wow, that's a great serum!

1078
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:14,826
Master Atari, whose death,
I think we can say,

1079
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,673
appears to have been
inaccurately reported,

1080
01:21:17,675 --> 01:21:19,369
has asked to read a statement
to the General Assembly.

1081
01:21:19,371 --> 01:21:21,064
He will then withdraw
from the debate

1082
01:21:21,066 --> 01:21:23,339
and respond
to no further questions.

1083
01:21:28,075 --> 01:21:29,448
Dear Editor-Hiroshi

1084
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:31,752
of the Megasaki Senior High
Daily-Manifesto:

1085
01:21:31,754 --> 01:21:33,129
in a series
of first-rate articles

1086
01:21:33,131 --> 01:21:37,000
by an attractive cub-reporter
on your staff,

1087
01:21:37,002 --> 01:21:38,186
you shine a spot-light

1088
01:21:38,188 --> 01:21:39,304
on the great injustice
that has occurred

1089
01:21:39,306 --> 01:21:41,384
under the Kobayashi
Administration.

1090
01:21:41,386 --> 01:21:43,305
I have spent much of my time
in recent weeks

1091
01:21:43,307 --> 01:21:45,576
traveling in the company
of the very kind of animals

1092
01:21:45,578 --> 01:21:47,880
our mayor refers to
as "bad-dogs."

1093
01:21:47,882 --> 01:21:48,905
They are the finest
living-beings

1094
01:21:48,907 --> 01:21:50,250
I have ever come to know

1095
01:21:50,252 --> 01:21:51,848
in all my dozen years
on this earth.

1096
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:54,249
To your readers,
the good people of Megasaki,

1097
01:21:54,251 --> 01:21:56,073
I say: the cycle of life

1098
01:21:56,075 --> 01:21:57,929
always hangs
in a delicate balance.

1099
01:21:57,931 --> 01:22:01,001
Who are we,
and who do we want to be?

1100
01:22:01,003 --> 01:22:03,145
Who are we?

1101
01:22:06,732 --> 01:22:09,033
I wrote a haiku
to try to express my feelings

1102
01:22:09,035 --> 01:22:11,177
about the suffering dogs
of Trash Island.

1103
01:22:11,179 --> 01:22:13,385
It is also about nature, love,

1104
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:16,170
friendship, eternity,
and a black owl.

1105
01:22:16,172 --> 01:22:18,956
I call it: Atari's Lantern.

1106
01:22:59,115 --> 01:23:01,096
He said a haiku.

1107
01:23:01,098 --> 01:23:04,076
I'll tell you later.

1108
01:23:06,025 --> 01:23:07,176
I dedicate this poem

1109
01:23:07,178 --> 01:23:09,353
to my distant-uncle,
Mayor Kobayashi,

1110
01:23:09,355 --> 01:23:12,360
who took me in
when I myself was a stray-dog

1111
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:14,025
with nowhere else to turn.

1112
01:23:14,027 --> 01:23:15,977
Editor-Hiroshi,
please extend my subscription

1113
01:23:15,979 --> 01:23:17,480
for an additional year.

1114
01:23:17,482 --> 01:23:19,784
I enclose a check in the
amount of one thousand yen.

1115
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:21,992
Signed, Atari Kobayashi,

1116
01:23:21,994 --> 01:23:24,236
former ward
to the mayoral-household.

1117
01:23:26,379 --> 01:23:28,044
Hmm.

1118
01:23:42,187 --> 01:23:43,595
Not-fair-to-the-boy.

1119
01:23:46,891 --> 01:23:48,396
Not-fair-to-the-dog.

1120
01:23:50,763 --> 01:23:53,674
He says: "I-have-no-honor."

1121
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:02,284
Hmm?

1122
01:24:11,754 --> 01:24:13,353
Holy Moses!

1123
01:24:13,355 --> 01:24:14,633
The mayor
has just officially

1124
01:24:14,635 --> 01:24:16,744
unstamped
the Trash Island Decree!

1125
01:24:16,746 --> 01:24:18,825
No kidding!

1126
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:27,688
Major-Domo
is accusing the mayor

1127
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:29,224
of breaking
his campaign promise!

1128
01:24:29,226 --> 01:24:30,855
He's steaming mad!

1129
01:24:37,707 --> 01:24:39,436
It's gonna be a fight!

1130
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:47,144
Spit him with a tooth!
I can't get a clean shot.

1131
01:24:47,146 --> 01:24:50,603
Too many innocent protesters.
I'll be right back.

1132
01:25:45,867 --> 01:25:47,784
Escape!

1133
01:25:47,786 --> 01:25:48,936
Escape! Escape!

1134
01:25:48,938 --> 01:25:50,475
Escape!

1135
01:26:21,835 --> 01:26:23,624
Well, the brain surgery
was a complete success.

1136
01:26:23,626 --> 01:26:24,808
But his left kidney failed

1137
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:26,569
due to the stress
of the operation.

1138
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:27,943
But, what about
the right one?

1139
01:26:27,945 --> 01:26:30,345
He lost it in a train-crash
three years ago.

1140
01:26:33,323 --> 01:26:36,489
Take my left kidney...

1141
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:40,075
give it to Atari-kun.

1142
01:27:24,777 --> 01:27:26,600
<i>According
to a long-standing statute</i>

1143
01:27:26,602 --> 01:27:27,880
<i>unique to Uni Prefecture,</i>

1144
01:27:27,882 --> 01:27:29,257
<i>in the event of the death,</i>

1145
01:27:29,259 --> 01:27:30,376
<i>disappearance,
or felony-prosecution</i>

1146
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:31,689
<i>of the chosen candidate</i>

1147
01:27:31,691 --> 01:27:33,064
<i>on, while, during,
or concurrent</i>

1148
01:27:33,066 --> 01:27:34,409
<i>with the Re-Election-Night
ceremony,</i>

1149
01:27:34,411 --> 01:27:35,817
<i>all powers and authorities</i>

1150
01:27:35,819 --> 01:27:37,128
<i>vested in his or her
designated office</i>

1151
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:38,665
<i>transfer forthwith
to his or her</i>

1152
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:40,360
<i>next-of-kin and/or
appointed heir.</i>

1153
01:27:40,362 --> 01:27:41,897
<i>In other words,</i>

1154
01:27:41,899 --> 01:27:45,481
Atari Kobayashi is the new
mayor of Megasaki City!

1155
01:27:45,483 --> 01:27:47,368
<i>You heard me right:
Atari Kobayashi</i>

1156
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:49,832
<i>is the new mayor
of Megasaki City!</i>

1157
01:27:49,834 --> 01:27:51,947
<i>Let's hope
that new kidney works.</i>

1158
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:55,562
Boy, what a night!

1159
01:27:59,402 --> 01:28:00,808
<i>Life in Uni Prefecture</i>

1160
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:03,081
<i>returned to a comfortable
tranquility.</i>

1161
01:28:03,083 --> 01:28:05,896
<i>The Megasaki Dragons
ended their winning streak</i>

1162
01:28:05,898 --> 01:28:08,363
<i>with a staggering loss
to the Honda Goblins.</i>

1163
01:28:09,611 --> 01:28:11,049
<i>Doggy-Chop re-opened</i>

1164
01:28:11,051 --> 01:28:13,032
<i>all 11
of its domestic factories-</i>

1165
01:28:13,034 --> 01:28:14,664
<i>and Puppy-Snaps
resumed production</i>

1166
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:16,363
<i>with an improved product.</i>

1167
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:22,185
<i>Graft and political corruption</i>

1168
01:28:22,187 --> 01:28:25,419
<i>were reduced to sustainable,
acceptable levels.</i>

1169
01:28:27,242 --> 01:28:28,712
<i>The Dog-Flu serum</i>

1170
01:28:28,714 --> 01:28:31,083
<i>cured every breathing-animal
in the region.</i>

1171
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:37,161
<i>Some say
a few lost-dogs</i>

1172
01:28:37,163 --> 01:28:39,177
<i>continue to roam and scavenge</i>

1173
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:40,617
<i>on Trash Island.</i>

1174
01:28:40,619 --> 01:28:44,779
<i>However, these
rumors remain unconfirmed.</i>

1175
01:28:51,403 --> 01:28:52,712
<i>Mayor Atari,</i>

1176
01:28:52,714 --> 01:28:54,344
<i>we all agree
it should be a crime</i>

1177
01:28:54,346 --> 01:28:55,849
<i>to abuse, beat, murder</i>

1178
01:28:55,851 --> 01:28:57,992
<i>or yell at any dog
in Megasaki City.</i>

1179
01:28:57,994 --> 01:28:59,656
<i>That is not the question.</i>

1180
01:28:59,658 --> 01:29:01,001
<i>The question is:</i>

1181
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:03,304
<i>what is the appropriate
punishment?</i>

1182
01:29:03,306 --> 01:29:07,210
<i>Exactly. And the answer is:
Death Penalty.</i>

1183
01:29:08,747 --> 01:29:11,272
<i>That seems excessive to us.</i>

1184
01:29:11,274 --> 01:29:13,001
<i>Possibly. Anyway,
we should make it</i>

1185
01:29:13,003 --> 01:29:14,761
<i>at least 30 days
community-service</i>

1186
01:29:14,763 --> 01:29:17,415
<i>and a fine
of no less than 250,000 yen.</i>

1187
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:18,730
<i>Meeting adjourned.</i>

1188
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:33,482
I'm standing-by, Master Atari.

1189
01:29:36,458 --> 01:29:38,728
So how does it feel
to be a former stray?

1190
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:41,353
Hmm. I take it
one day at a time.

1191
01:29:41,355 --> 01:29:42,823
Last week, I nearly be-handed

1192
01:29:42,825 --> 01:29:45,032
an industrial lobbyist
from West Suzuki.

1193
01:29:45,034 --> 01:29:46,984
They had to give him
a blood transfusion.

1194
01:29:46,986 --> 01:29:49,544
He probably had it coming.

1195
01:29:49,546 --> 01:29:52,392
Maybe. Learned any new tricks?

1196
01:29:52,394 --> 01:29:54,440
Actually, yes. Just one.

1197
01:29:54,442 --> 01:29:56,203
Can I see it?

1198
01:29:58,730 --> 01:29:59,943
I'm supposed to be juggling

1199
01:29:59,945 --> 01:30:01,160
ten bowling-pins
engulfed in flames

1200
01:30:01,162 --> 01:30:02,375
over my tail at this point,

1201
01:30:02,377 --> 01:30:04,712
but you just have to imagine
that part.

1202
01:30:05,995 --> 01:30:08,137
I can picture it.

1203
01:30:08,139 --> 01:30:13,096
You still against bringing
puppies into this world?

1204
01:30:13,098 --> 01:30:15,433
I'll tell you
when I get to know you better.

1205
01:30:15,435 --> 01:30:17,321
Fair enough.

1206
01:30:17,323 --> 01:30:19,945
My friends think
I like to fight,

1207
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:21,831
but it's just not true.

1208
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,329
Sometimes I lose my temper
and blow off a little steam,

1209
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:26,887
but I've never enjoyed it.

1210
01:30:26,889 --> 01:30:28,810
I'm not a violent dog.

1211
01:30:30,155 --> 01:30:32,235
I don't know why I bite.

1212
01:30:33,579 --> 01:30:36,011
I'm not attracted
to tame animals.

1213
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:40,906
Thank you.

1214
