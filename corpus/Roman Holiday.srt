1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,480
- Miss Webber.
- Just for two minutes.

2
00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:03,069
No.

3
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:07,074
Go, it's my camera.

4
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:18,096
You musician, maybe?

5
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:21,099
You artist, huh?

6
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:23,090
Painter?

7
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:28,715
I know. You model.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,741
- Model, huh?
- Thank you.

9
00:00:32,754 --> 00:00:34,721
It's perfect.

10
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:40,762
You're nice without long hair.
Now it's cool, huh? Cool.

11
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:42,753
It's just what I wanted.

12
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:47,769
Now, why don't you
come dancing tonight with me?

13
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:49,760
You should see, it's so nice.

14
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:54,776
It's on a boat, on the Tiber,
the river, by Sant'Angelo.

15
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:59,781
Moonlight, music, romantic.
It's very, very...

16
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:03,774
- Please, you come?
- I wish I could.

17
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:11,793
But your friends,
I don't think they'll recognise you.

18
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:13,784
No, I don't think they will.

19
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:16,787
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

20
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:24,795
After nine I'll be there, dancing on
the river. Remember Sant'Angelo.

21
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:30,801
All my friends... If you come,
you will be most pretty of all girls.

22
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:36,783
Thank you.

23
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:37,807
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,871
Thank you.

25
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:08,904
A thousand lire.

26
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,902
- No money.
- No?

27
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:15,906
I'm sorry, I've really no money.

28
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:20,910
Look.

29
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:27,917
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:04,966
- Well, it's you!
- Yes, Mr Bradley.

31
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:07,958
Or is it?

32
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,962
- Do you like it?
- Very much.

33
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:17,968
So that was your
mysterious appointment.

34
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,983
- I have a confession to make.
- A confession?

35
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:26,988
Yes, I ran away
last night... from school.

36
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:28,955
Why?

37
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,993
- Trouble with the teacher?
- No, nothing like that.

38
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:34,961
You wouldn't run away for nothing.

39
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:36,963
It was only meant to be
for a few hours.

40
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:41,002
They gave me something
last night to make me sleep.

41
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:42,993
Oh, I see.

42
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:50,000
- I'd better get a taxi and go back.
- Look, before you do,

43
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:54,004
why not take a little time for yourself?

44
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:55,982
Maybe another hour.

45
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:59,986
Live dangerously, take the whole day.

46
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:02,012
I could do some things
I've always wanted to.

47
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:03,990
Like what?

48
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:09,030
You can't imagine. I'd like to do
whatever I liked, the whole day long.

49
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:12,045
Like having your hair cut
and eating gelati?

50
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,025
Yes, and I'd like to
sit at a sidewalk café,

51
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:19,034
look in shop windows,
walk in the rain.

52
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,032
Have fun, and maybe
some excitement.

53
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:26,047
It doesn't seem much to you,
does it?

54
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:28,014
It's great.

55
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:32,553
Tell you what. Why don't we
do all those things... together?

56
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:37,058
- Don't you have to work?
- No. Today will be a holiday.

57
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:40,061
You don't want to do
a lot of silly things.

58
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:43,053
Don't I? First wish, one sidewalk café.

59
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:46,056
Coming right up.
I know just the place.

60
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:59,080
What will they say in school
about your hair?

61
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:02,048
They'll have a fit.

62
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,075
What would they say if they knew
I'd slept in your room?

63
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:10,091
Tell you what, you don't tell your folks
and I won't tell mine.

64
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:11,057
It's a pact.

65
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:17,088
- Now, what would you like to drink?
- Champagne, please.

66
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:23,069
Champagne?

67
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:29,100
Well, champagne,
and cold coffee for me.

68
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:34,104
Must be quite a school,
champagne for lunch.

69
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:37,107
- Only on special occasions.
- For instance?

70
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:40,121
The last time
was my father's anniversary.

71
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:42,088
- Wedding?
- No.

72
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:46,627
The fortieth anniversary
of... the day he got his job.

73
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:51,132
Forty years on the job.
What do you know about that?

74
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:54,100
What does he do?

75
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:58,139
Well, mostly you might
call it public relations.

76
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:00,106
Oh, well that's hard work.

77
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:02,132
- I wouldn't care for it.
- Does he?

78
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:05,146
I've heard him complain about it.

79
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:07,137
Why doesn't he quit?

80
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:11,152
People in that line of work
almost never do quit,

81
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:14,155
unless it's actually unhealthy
for them to continue.

82
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,147
Well, here's to his health then.

83
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:21,151
You know, that's what
everybody says.

84
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,158
- It's all right?
- Yes, thank you.

85
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,137
What is your work?

86
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:34,164
Oh, I'm in the selling game.

87
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:36,177
Really? How interesting.

88
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:38,168
What do you sell?

89
00:07:41,182 --> 00:07:46,176
Fertiliser. Chemicals, stuff like that.

90
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:58,188
- Irving! Am I glad to see you!
- Why, did you forget your wallet?

91
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,191
- Sit down.
- Aren't you going to introduce me?

92
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:06,207
Yes. This is a very good friend of
mine, Irving Radovich. Anya, Irving.

93
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:08,174
- Anya...?
- Smith.

94
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:12,202
- Oh. Hiya, Smitty.
- Charmed.

95
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:19,209
Hey, did anybody ever tell you
you're a dead ringer for...

96
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:31,222
- Well, I guess I'll be going.
- No, don't do that, join us.

97
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:37,227
Well, just till Francesca gets here.

98
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:41,742
Tell me Mr Radovich,
what is a ringer?

99
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:45,211
- Oh, waiter!
- It's an American term.

100
00:08:45,246 --> 00:08:50,251
It means anyone who has
a great deal of charm.

101
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:52,765
Oh, thank you.

102
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,245
You're welcome.

103
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,249
Cousins.

104
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:04,254
Mr Bradley's just been telling me
all about his work.

105
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,257
- I'd like to have heard that.
- What do you do?

106
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:11,272
I'm in the same racket as Joe,
only I'm a...

107
00:09:11,307 --> 00:09:14,240
I'm awfully sorry, Irving.

108
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:17,243
- What are you...?
- I'm sorry.

109
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,270
I can take a hint. I'll see you around.

110
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:25,275
- But your drink's just here.
- Yeah, Irving, take it easy.

111
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:30,291
I'm sorry about that.
Sit down, that's a good fellow.

112
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:32,282
That's the boy.

113
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:36,797
You're... You're twisting
my arm, you know.

114
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:40,301
Just be a little more careful not to spill.

115
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:43,304
- Spill? Who's been spilling?
- You.

116
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:45,295
- Me?
- Yeah.

117
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:49,299
Where did you find this loony?

118
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:57,318
You're OK. Here's to you, huh?
Here's hoping for the best.

119
00:09:57,353 --> 00:10:02,312
If it wasn't for that hair,
I'd swear that you...

120
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:07,317
Thanks.

121
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,331
You slipped, you almost hurt yourself.

122
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:13,323
- I slipped?
- Yes, you did.

123
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:16,302
- I didn't slip.
- A bad sprain...

124
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:20,341
- Never mind!
- You'd better get it fixed up.

125
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:24,310
- Would you excuse us?
- Of course, I'm so sorry.

126
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:28,338
Joe, what are you trying to do?
Take your hands off me.

127
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,351
- Got your lighter?
- What?

128
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:32,342
- Have you?
- Yeah.

129
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:37,358
Listen, what would you do
for five grand?

130
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:39,325
- Five grand?
- Look...

131
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,354
She doesn't know who I am.
This is my story, I gotta protect it.

132
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:47,333
She's really the...

133
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:50,371
Your pictures
will make this twice as valuable.

134
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:53,374
- The princess goes slumming.
- You're in for 25°%.

135
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:57,378
- Of 5,000?
- Minimum, Hennessy shook on it.

136
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:00,346
- That's $1,500!
- It's $1,250.

137
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:04,350
- Now you shake.
- OK, now lend me 30,000.

138
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:07,888
That's $50! Are you gonna buy
the crown jewels?

139
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:11,159
She's drinking champagne.
We gotta entertain her.

140
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:14,395
We can't go running around
with a hot princess!

141
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,388
Do you want in
on this deal or don't you?

142
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:29,410
- This I want back Saturday.
- OK. Now where's your lighter?

143
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:30,399
Let's go to work.

144
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:40,410
- Better now?
- Huh?

145
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:44,425
- Your ear.
- My ear?

146
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,393
Oh, yeah, Joe fixed it.

147
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:50,420
- Would you like a cigarette?
- Yes, please.

148
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:53,423
You won't believe it,
but it's my very first.

149
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:56,402
Your very first?

150
00:11:56,437 --> 00:12:01,431
- No smoking in school?
- Your first cigarette.

151
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:09,439
There, the gismo works.

152
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:14,420
Well, what's the verdict, OK?

153
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:17,447
- Nothing to it.
- That's right, nothing to it.

154
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:23,429
I'll stretch my legs a little.

155
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:28,458
- I'll pick this one up, Irving.
- You can afford it.

156
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,474
What next?
Shall we make a little schedule?

157
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:36,442
Oh, not that word, please.

158
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:40,475
I didn't mean a work schedule...
a school schedule,

159
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,474
- I meant a fun schedule.
- Let's just go, huh?

160
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:48,489
How about you, Irving, are you ready?

161
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:51,481
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

162
00:12:53,494 --> 00:12:57,463
Francesca. Oh, this is...

163
00:12:57,498 --> 00:13:00,501
- Smitty.
- She's a grand girl, Irving.

164
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:02,492
Five grand.

165
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:06,472
- Joe.
- Where are you going now?

166
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:09,499
Honey, I gotta work.
I'll call you tonight.

167
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:54,555
Look at those men! They were
supposed to be inconspicuous.

168
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,546
You asked for plain clothes.

169
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,658
Hey, stop, come back.

170
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:48,288
I'm going straight from now on.

171
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:50,756
News Service? What did he mean?

172
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:56,291
Oh, you say you're with the press
and you can get away with anything.

173
00:17:56,326 --> 00:18:01,791
Going to church to get married
on a scooter! Joe's a wonderful liar.

174
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,802
Congratulations!

175
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:27,817
Don't look so worried,
I won't hold you to it.

176
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:29,818
Thank you very much.

177
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:32,833
Don't be too grateful.

178
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:34,824
OK, I won't.

179
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:39,805
I'm a good liar too, aren't I?

180
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,844
- The best I ever met.
- Thank you very much.

181
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:47,837
Say... Come with me.

182
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:55,821
The Mouth of Truth.

183
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:59,860
The legend is, if you're a liar
and you put your hand in there,

184
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:01,827
it'll be bitten off.

185
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:07,858
- What a horrid idea.
- Let's see you do it.

186
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:33,883
Let's see you do it.

187
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:37,887
Sure.

188
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,883
Hello!

189
00:19:57,918 --> 00:20:03,924
- You beast, you're all right!
- I'm sorry. It was just a joke.

190
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:07,928
- You never hurt your hand.
- I'm sorry.

191
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:09,895
- OK?
- Yes.

192
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,921
All right, let's go. Look out!

193
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:23,933
I'll park at the corner.

194
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:48,969
What do they mean,
all these inscriptions?

195
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:51,937
Each one represents a wish fulfilled.

196
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:54,940
It started during the war, in an air raid.

197
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:58,979
A man with his four children
was caught in the street.

198
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:02,500
He ran to that wall for shelter
and prayed.

199
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:05,951
Bombs fell very close
but no one was hurt.

200
00:21:05,986 --> 00:21:09,979
Later, he came back
and put up the first tablet.

201
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:12,993
Now it's a sort of shrine.

202
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:13,959
People come,

203
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:18,988
and when their wishes are granted,
they put up another plaque.

204
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,989
Lovely story.

205
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:26,996
Read some of the inscriptions.

206
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:45,014
Make a wish? Tell the doctor?

207
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:51,020
Anyway, the chances of it
being granted are very slight.

208
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,022
Well, what now?

209
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:59,039
- I've heard you can dance on a boat.
- You mean Sant'Angelo.

210
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:01,041
- Couldn't we go tonight?
- Why not?

211
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:03,008
Anything you wish.

212
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:09,049
At midnight I'll turn into a pumpkin
and drive away in my glass slipper.

213
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:11,040
That'll be the end of the fairytale.

214
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:15,044
- I guess Irving has to go now.
- I do?

215
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:20,060
Yes, you know, that big business
development you have to attend to?

216
00:22:20,095 --> 00:22:23,063
- That development.
- Can't afford not to.

217
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:26,031
Yeah. See you later, Smitty.

218
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:30,059
- Good luck with the big development.
- Thanks.

219
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,159
Hello.

220
00:24:12,172 --> 00:24:14,163
Hello.

221
00:24:29,189 --> 00:24:34,194
Mr Bradley, if you don't mind my
saying so, I think you're a ringer.

222
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:38,163
A what? Oh, thanks very much.

223
00:24:38,198 --> 00:24:44,204
You've spent the whole day doing
things I've always wanted to. Why?

224
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:46,171
It seemed the thing to do.

225
00:24:46,206 --> 00:24:50,199
I've never heard of anybody so kind.

226
00:24:51,211 --> 00:24:53,178
It wasn't any trouble.

227
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:56,205
Or so completely unselfish.

228
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:03,212
Let's have a drink at the bar.

229
00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:11,220
There you are.

230
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:17,237
I look for you a long time.
I think maybe you not come.

231
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:22,242
- Off, all off!
- It's nice without, isn't it? Cool.

232
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:26,246
- Oh, very good.
- This is Mr Bradley.

233
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:28,213
I Mario Delani.

234
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:31,251
- Old friends?
- Yes, he cut my hair.

235
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:33,242
He invited me here tonight.

236
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:38,258
- What was your name?
- Mario Delani.

237
00:25:38,293 --> 00:25:42,262
Mario Delani.
I'm very glad to know you.

238
00:25:42,297 --> 00:25:44,253
Me too.

239
00:25:45,265 --> 00:25:49,269
Oh, may I enjoy myself the pleasure?

240
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:52,272
- You mind?
- Go right ahead.

241
00:25:52,307 --> 00:25:53,261
I thank you.

242
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:19,794
- Did I miss anything?
- You're just in time.

243
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:23,292
- Who's Smitty dancing with?
- Her barber.

244
00:26:24,304 --> 00:26:27,307
He cut her hair this afternoon,
made a date for tonight.

245
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:28,296
The princess and the barber?

246
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:42,371
- What is it?
- Momento.

247
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,401
August!

248
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,409
Thank you.

249
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:27,415
Bye.

250
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:41,430
Your Highness.

251
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:47,447
Dance quietly towards the entrance.
A car is waiting.

252
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:49,414
- No.
- Your Highness!

253
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:53,418
You've made a mistake. Let me go!

254
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:58,447
Will you let me go? Mr Bradley!
Let me go, will you! Mr Bradley!

255
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:16,525
Hit him again, Smitty!

256
00:30:25,545 --> 00:30:28,548
- Here are my car keys.
- Police!

257
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:30,539
The other side of the bridge.

258
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:44,624
- All right?
- Fine, you?

259
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:46,615
Oh, fine.

260
00:31:51,631 --> 00:31:53,627
You were great back there.

261
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,624
You weren't so bad yourself.

262
00:32:22,662 --> 00:32:23,651
I...

263
00:32:25,665 --> 00:32:28,657
I guess we'd better get out of here.

264
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:50,655
This is the American Hour,

265
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,683
continuing our programme
of musical selections.

266
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:23,712
- Everything ruined?
- No. They'll be dry in a minute.

267
00:33:26,726 --> 00:33:30,719
Suits you. You should
always wear my clothes.

268
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:33,722
Seems I do.

269
00:33:37,737 --> 00:33:41,730
I thought a little wine might be good.

270
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:46,245
- Shall I cook something?
- No kitchen.

271
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,510
- I always eat out.
- Do you like that?

272
00:33:49,545 --> 00:33:52,741
Well, life isn't always what one likes.

273
00:33:53,753 --> 00:33:58,747
- Is it?
- No, it isn't.

274
00:34:06,766 --> 00:34:08,757
- Tired?
- A little.

275
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:11,760
- You've had quite a day.
- A wonderful day.

276
00:34:12,772 --> 00:34:16,776
This is the American Hour
with a special news bulletin.

277
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:20,745
There is no further word
from the bedside of Princess Ann,

278
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:25,785
who was taken ill yesterday
on the last leg of her European tour.

279
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,753
Rumours suggest
her condition may be serious,

280
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:32,781
causing alarm and anxiety
among the people in her country.

281
00:34:36,796 --> 00:34:39,793
- The news can wait.
- Yes.

282
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,791
May I have a little more wine?

283
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:47,796
I'm sorry I couldn't
cook us some dinner.

284
00:34:48,808 --> 00:34:50,775
Did you learn how in school?

285
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,813
I'm a good cook.
I could earn my living at it.

286
00:34:53,848 --> 00:34:56,833
I can sew too, clean a house, iron.

287
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:59,784
I learned to do all those things,

288
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:03,812
I just haven't had the chance
to do it for anyone.

289
00:35:06,826 --> 00:35:13,823
Well, looks like I'll have to move
and get a place with a kitchen.

290
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:19,827
Yes.

291
00:35:45,865 --> 00:35:48,857
I shall have to go now.

292
00:36:03,883 --> 00:36:05,874
Anya...

293
00:36:07,887 --> 00:36:10,879
...there's something I want to tell you.

294
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:17,891
No, please.

295
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,888
Nothing.

296
00:36:32,912 --> 00:36:35,904
I must go and get dressed.

297
00:37:15,955 --> 00:37:17,957
Stop at the next corner, please.

298
00:37:17,992 --> 00:37:19,948
OK.

299
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:39,968
- Here?
- Yes.

300
00:37:48,988 --> 00:37:50,979
I have to leave you now.

301
00:37:57,997 --> 00:38:04,003
I'm going to that
corner there and turning.

302
00:38:04,038 --> 00:38:06,995
You stay in the car and drive away.

303
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:10,999
Promise not to watch me
go beyond the corner.

304
00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:16,004
Just drive away and leave me.

305
00:38:17,016 --> 00:38:19,007
As I leave you.

306
00:38:26,025 --> 00:38:27,014
All right.

307
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:33,021
I don't know how to say goodbye.

308
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:38,026
I can't think of any words.

309
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:43,031
Don't try.

310
00:40:35,154 --> 00:40:37,121
Your Royal Highness,

311
00:40:37,156 --> 00:40:42,150
twenty-four hours,
they can't all be blank.

312
00:40:44,163 --> 00:40:46,154
They are not.

313
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:50,169
What explanation am I
to offer Their Majesties?

314
00:40:50,204 --> 00:40:53,161
I was indisposed. I am better.

315
00:40:56,175 --> 00:41:01,180
Ma'am, you must appreciate
that I have my duty to perform,

316
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:04,183
just as Your Royal
Highness has her duty.

317
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:06,150
Your Excellency,

318
00:41:06,185 --> 00:41:10,178
I trust you will not find it necessary
to use that word again.

319
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:16,195
Were I not completely aware of
my duty to my family and my country,

320
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,187
I would not have come back tonight.

321
00:41:25,204 --> 00:41:27,195
Or indeed, ever again.

322
00:41:34,213 --> 00:41:41,210
And now, since I understand
we have a very full schedule today,

323
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:45,213
you have my permission to withdraw.

324
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,232
No milk and crackers.

325
00:42:10,249 --> 00:42:14,242
That will be all thank you, Countess.

326
00:43:14,313 --> 00:43:17,281
- Did you really get it?
- What?

327
00:43:17,316 --> 00:43:20,308
The princess exclusive.
Did you get it?

328
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,311
- No, I didn't.
- What? That's impossible.

329
00:43:24,323 --> 00:43:26,290
- Coffee?
- Don't hold out on me.

330
00:43:26,325 --> 00:43:30,294
- Who's holding out?
- You are. I know too much.

331
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:34,322
First you ask about an exclusive
on the princess, next you disappear.

332
00:43:35,334 --> 00:43:39,338
Then I hear a rumour from the
embassy that she's out on the town.

333
00:43:39,373 --> 00:43:43,307
Do you believe every rumour
that comes your way?

334
00:43:43,342 --> 00:43:47,846
There's a lot of other rumours.
About a shindig down by the river,

335
00:43:47,881 --> 00:43:52,351
and the arrest of eight secret
service men from a certain country.

336
00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:57,321
Then she makes
a miraculous recovery. It all adds up.

337
00:43:57,356 --> 00:44:04,363
Don't think you'll raise the price,
a deal's a deal. Now come on.

338
00:44:04,398 --> 00:44:08,356
- Where is that story?
- I have no story.

339
00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:13,872
- Now what was the idea...
- Joe.

340
00:44:13,907 --> 00:44:17,376
- Wait till you see these.
- Irving.

341
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:19,378
Hi, Mr Hennessy.

342
00:44:19,413 --> 00:44:20,367
Irving!

343
00:44:23,382 --> 00:44:26,374
- What's the idea?
- You charge in, spilling things!

344
00:44:27,386 --> 00:44:29,377
- Me?
- I warned you before.

345
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:33,357
- Remember?
- Look at my pants.

346
00:44:33,392 --> 00:44:36,384
- Come and dry them off.
- Nuts to that.

347
00:44:37,396 --> 00:44:39,387
- Did you tell him about Smitty?
- Who?

348
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:42,896
- Wait till you...
- Irving!

349
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:45,393
There you go again, Irving.

350
00:44:47,406 --> 00:44:50,398
- Joe...
- Save that till later.

351
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:55,414
- Why don't you go home and shave?
- Shave?

352
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:59,418
Or else keep quiet
till we're finished talking.

353
00:44:59,453 --> 00:45:01,938
What kind of routine is that?

354
00:45:01,973 --> 00:45:04,388
What are you up to? Who's Smitty?

355
00:45:04,423 --> 00:45:07,391
- A guy we met.
- What is there to look at?

356
00:45:07,426 --> 00:45:11,430
Just some of Irving's dames.
You wouldn't like them.

357
00:45:11,465 --> 00:45:14,951
- Maybe you would.
- Don't change the subject.

358
00:45:14,986 --> 00:45:18,402
- Yesterday you said...
- I had a good lead.

359
00:45:18,437 --> 00:45:24,433
But I was wrong, that's all
there is to it. There is no story.

360
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:27,411
OK.

361
00:45:27,446 --> 00:45:33,442
She's holding the press interview
today. Maybe you can get that story.

362
00:45:35,454 --> 00:45:37,421
And you owe me $500.

363
00:45:37,456 --> 00:45:42,450
- Take it from my salary, $50 a week.
- Don't think I won't.

364
00:45:44,463 --> 00:45:47,466
What gives?
Have we had a better offer?

365
00:45:47,501 --> 00:45:49,433
Irving...

366
00:45:49,468 --> 00:45:53,472
I don't know just how
to tell you this, but...

367
00:45:53,507 --> 00:45:55,463
Wait till I sit down.

368
00:45:57,476 --> 00:46:04,483
Well, in regard to the story
that goes with these,

369
00:46:04,518 --> 00:46:06,474
there is no story.

370
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:10,454
Why not?

371
00:46:10,489 --> 00:46:14,482
I mean, not as far as I'm concerned.

372
00:46:25,504 --> 00:46:31,500
The pictures came out pretty well.
Want to have a look at them?

373
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,513
How about a blow-up
from a negative that size?

374
00:46:47,526 --> 00:46:49,528
- Her first cigarette!
- Yeah.

375
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:51,519
The Mouth of Truth.

376
00:46:53,532 --> 00:46:58,526
I had a caption in mind:
"Barber cuts in. "

377
00:46:59,538 --> 00:47:02,530
Here's the key shot
for the whole layout.

378
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,544
"The Wall Where
Wishes Come True. "

379
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:06,533
Joe, that's good.

380
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:10,538
Lead off with that,
then follow up with the wishes?

381
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,554
I got that from the file.
"Princess Inspects Police. "

382
00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:16,543
Yeah...

383
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:20,524
"Police Inspects Princess. "

384
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,561
- How about that?
- Pretty good.

385
00:47:22,596 --> 00:47:24,552
I got a topper for you.

386
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:28,532
- Wow!
- Is that a shot?

387
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:31,570
- What a picture!
- Is that a shot?

388
00:47:31,605 --> 00:47:33,537
"Bodyguard Gets Body Blow. "

389
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:37,576
No, how about this?
"Crowned Head?" Huh?

390
00:47:37,611 --> 00:47:40,568
Oh, I get it. Joe, you got...

391
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:49,553
She's fair game, Joe.

392
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:52,580
It's always open season
on princesses.

393
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:58,562
- You must be out of your mind.
- I know, but...

394
00:47:58,597 --> 00:48:03,591
Look, I can't prevent you from
selling the pictures, if you want to.

395
00:48:04,603 --> 00:48:07,595
- You'll get a good price for them.
- Yeah.

396
00:48:13,612 --> 00:48:17,616
- Are you going to the interview?
- Are you?

397
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:19,607
Yeah. It's an assignment, isn't it?

398
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:22,610
Yeah.

399
00:48:27,626 --> 00:48:28,615
I'll see you.

400
00:48:43,642 --> 00:48:47,635
It ain't much, but it's home.

401
00:48:56,655 --> 00:49:00,648
Ladies and gentlemen,
please approach.

402
00:49:29,688 --> 00:49:31,679
Her Royal Highness.

403
00:49:59,718 --> 00:50:01,685
Your Royal Highness,

404
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,712
the ladies and gentlemen
of the press.

405
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,726
Ladies and gentlemen,

406
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:45,764
Her Royal Highness
will now answer your questions.

407
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:47,755
I believe at the outset,
Your Highness,

408
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:51,759
that I should express
the pleasure of all of us,

409
00:50:52,771 --> 00:50:55,763
at your recovery
from the recent illness.

410
00:50:57,776 --> 00:50:58,765
Thank you.

411
00:50:59,778 --> 00:51:01,745
Does Your Highness believe

412
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,774
that federation could be a solution
to Europe's economic problems?

413
00:51:08,787 --> 00:51:10,754
I am in favour of any measure

414
00:51:10,789 --> 00:51:14,782
which would lead
to closer cooperation in Europe.

415
00:51:16,795 --> 00:51:19,792
And what, in the opinion
of Your Highness,

416
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,790
is the outlook for
friendship among nations?

417
00:51:23,802 --> 00:51:26,794
I have every faith in it...

418
00:51:28,807 --> 00:51:31,799
...as I have faith
in relations between people.

419
00:51:37,816 --> 00:51:41,809
May I say, speaking for
my own press service...

420
00:51:43,822 --> 00:51:48,816
...we believe that Your Highness's
faith will not be unjustified.

421
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:54,822
I am so glad to hear you say it.

422
00:51:56,835 --> 00:52:00,828
Which of the cities visited
did Your Highness enjoy the most?

423
00:52:15,854 --> 00:52:19,847
Each in its own way
was unforgettable.

424
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:22,850
It would be difficult to...

425
00:52:24,863 --> 00:52:30,859
Rome! By all means, Rome.

426
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:39,868
I will cherish my visit here
in memory, as long as I live.

427
00:52:45,884 --> 00:52:48,876
Despite your indisposition,
Your Highness?

428
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:52,879
Despite that.

429
00:52:53,892 --> 00:52:56,884
Photographs may now be taken.

430
00:53:24,923 --> 00:53:27,926
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

431
00:53:27,961 --> 00:53:29,893
Thank you very much.

432
00:53:29,928 --> 00:53:35,924
I would now like to meet some of
the ladies and gentlemen of the press.

434
00:53:53,952 --> 00:53:57,956

How do you do?

446
00:54:56,014 --> 00:54:57,981
May I present Your Highness

447
00:54:58,016 --> 00:55:01,008

of your visit to Rome?

448
00:55:07,025 --> 00:55:10,017
