<i>Oxygen levels are dropping.</i>

<i>Brain function, normal.</i>

<i>Cerebral salvage,

<i>Robotic skeleton prepared

<i>Now your eyes...
are gonna open.</i>

00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,590
<i>You are safe.</i>

8
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,030
It's ok, just breathe.

9
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,690
Just breathe.

10
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,580
Breathe.

11
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,860
Good.

12
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,780
That's good.

13
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,510
Hello, Mira.

14
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,970
I'm Dr. Ouelet.

15
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,250
Do you remember anything
about the attack?

16
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,030
What happened?

17
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,110
I was...
You were drowning.

18
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,900
There was water.

19
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,022
That's right. You were on a boat,

20
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:32,578
a refugee boat.

21
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:34,930
It was sunk by terrorists.

22
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,120
Why can't I feel my body?

23
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,430
Mira, your body was damaged.
We could not save that.

24
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,000
Only your brain survived.

25
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,600
We made you a new body.

26
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,880
A synthetic shell.

27
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,460
But your mind, your soul...

28
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,150
Your ghost.

29
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,130
It's still in there.

30
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Please.

31
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,380
Sedate her.

32
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,980
Will it work?

33
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,100
Absolutely.

34
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,580
She's a miracle.

35
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,570
A machine can't lead,
It can only follow orders.

36
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,720
A machine can't imagine or care or intuit.

37
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,350
But as a human mind in
a cybernetic frame...

38
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,080
Mira can do all those things, and more.

39
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,220
The first of her kind.

40
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,440
She will join Section 9
as soon as she is operational.

41
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,870
Please don't do that.

42
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,470
You reducing a complex human to a machine.

43
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,970
I don't think of her as a machine.

44
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,930
She is a weapon.

45
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,890
And the future of my company.

46
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,190
<i>ONE YEAR LATER</i>

47
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,560
<i>The first artificially created

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,010
<i>All patrolling area units, be advised

54
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,930
<i>Airspace in adjoining areas

55
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,557
<i>Section 9 is currently on site.</i>

56
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,482
<i>I repeat: All patrolling area units,
be advised, possible cyber crime...</i>

57
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,510
This is major. I'm on site.

58
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,630
Awaiting instructions.

59
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,350
<i>Analyze and report.</i>

60
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,830
I'm human, I am flawed.

61
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,980
But I embrace change...

62
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,260
and enhancement.

63
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,200
Now there is nothing I can't do.

64
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,160
Nothing I can't know, nothing I can't be.

65
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,150
Wait and listen to something.

66
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,080
It's my 4 year old daughter.

67
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,800
In the time it took her
to sing that lullaby

68
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,310
she learned to speak fluent French.

69
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,630
<i>Do you know that song?</i>

70
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,920
There is an echo box up here.

71
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,960
Someone is scanning data traffic.

72
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,520
<i>Keeps track of where it is transmitted.</i>

73
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,800
To see who's worth
this kind of surveillance.

74
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,470
Accessing hotel security network.

75
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,350
What're you seeing, sir?
I've got a lot of hotel to scan.

76
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,070
<i>There is a banquet room reserved for
the President of the African Federation.</i>

77
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,730
<i>Dr. Osmond is invited
on behalf of Hanka Robotics.</i>

78
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,360
Got it. 43rd floor.

79
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,760
Someone contacted the president staff.
Someone is watching him.

80
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,800
Dr. Osmond...

81
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,690
What is it you want from us?

82
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,900
I think it is more about what
Hanka Robotics can do for you.

83
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,670
73% of this world has woken up
to the age of cyber enhancement.

84
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,000
Do you really wanna be left behind?

85
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,520
My people embrace cyber enhancement
as do I.

86
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,620
There is no one who really
understand the risk...

87
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,050
To individuality, identity,
messing with the human soul.

88
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,990
Gentlemen, Excuse me,
I think you've the wrong...

89
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,470
Hallway. Six men. Shots fired.

90
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,760
Section 9 ETA?

91
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,250
- Two minutes out, Major.
- Too long.

92
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,670
I'm going in.

93
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,170
<i>Hold!</i>

94
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,420
<i>Major, stop!</i>

95
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,390
I had heard this speech before
from your competitors.

96
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,120
And now Hanka Robotics
serves it with Milky suck.

97
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:53,423
<i>Hey.. hey..</i>

98
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,220
Look. This is what I'm talking about.

99
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,940
<i>Major!</i>

100
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,790
<i>Initiate...
The hack.</i>

101
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,469
<i>Help me. Please. Don't let me die.</i>

102
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:49,430
Who sent you?

103
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,130
<i>Help me. Please.</i>

104
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,410
Answer me!

105
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,310
<i>Collaborate with Hanka Robotics

106
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,520
You okay?

107
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,330
You're injured.

108
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,910
You're not the same.

109
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,280
Hey.

110
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,560
It's just a robot!

111
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,050
<i>Your skin deserves the best, so do you.
Try our hand cream.</i>

112
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,120
<i>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,
CENTRAL OFFICE, SECTION 9</i>

113
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,140
So what do we have on Osmond?

114
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,010
So far, very little.

115
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,570
He was the head of Hanka's
robotics division.

116
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,200
Human, but of course cyber enhanced.

117
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,000
So how did they hack him?

118
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,870
Somehow this geisha bot
got past his encryption.

119
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,650
Something is different.

120
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,140
What'd you get?

121
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,500
Why you always thinking
he's out there enhancing.

122
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,330
Because he is.

123
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,200
A cyber mech liver.

124
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,130
Been saving up for a while.

125
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,890
Now it's last call every night.

126
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,390
You got enhanced
so you can drink more?

127
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,940
Embrace enhancements, Togusa.
We would not be here without it.

128
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,740
I am all human and happy, thanks.

129
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,560
Any more information
about the seized geisha bot?

130
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,220
Hanka is running scans.

131
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,710
Dr. Dahlin will have the
reports ready but...

132
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,680
<i>I've been talking to the Prime Minister.</i>

133
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,550
<i>He wants a full report.</i>

134
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,510
<i>Togusa.</i>

135
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,710
Following last night's attack...

136
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,880
3 more Hanka's scientists were murdered...

137
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,950
at the company's central laboratory.

138
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,880
The first two were shot...

139
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,720
and the third was beaten to death
by his own service robot.

140
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,810
All showed signs of cerebral hacking.

141
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,600
The same as the geisha did to Osmond.

142
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,120
And all were senior figures... in Hanka.

143
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,800
Just like Osmond.

144
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,173
A message was left
at each of the crime scene...

145
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,570
By someone identifying himself...

146
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,140
as <i>Kuze.</i>

147
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,570

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,330
<i>and be destroyed.</i>

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,620
<i>You and Ladriya go speak to Mr. Cutter,

152
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,530
<i>Major and Batou

153
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,980
<i>Find out what has been
recovered from the geisha.</i>

154
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,800
<i>Major!</i>

155
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
<i>I told you not jump off.</i>

156
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,370
I had to, or more would have died.

157
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,060
<i>You are a member of my team,
and my responsibility</i>

158
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,990
I'll find him... and I will kill him.

159
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,830
It's what I am built for, isn't it?

160
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,680
<i>You are more than just a weapon.</i>

161
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,560
<i>You have a soul, a ghost.</i>

162
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,740
<i>When we see our uniqueness as a virtue...</i>

163
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,830
<i>Only then will we find peace.</i>

164
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,660
<i>Safely reconfiguring the
child's genetic Structure.</i>

165
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,280
<i>Families built better.</i>

166
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,770
What was going on with you
at the hotel last night?

167
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,230
Nothing. I'm fine.

168
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,650
You sure?

169
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,230
<i>- Hey, sweetheart, want an upgrade?
- Move.</i>

170
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,430
<i>- I have anything you want.
- Back off!</i>

171
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,710
Hey, Ming!

172
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,830
Hey, Batou!

173
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,430
- Got your bones.
- Thanks man.

174
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,470
For the dogs.

175
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,450
For someone who doesn't like people,
how come you care about dogs so much?

176
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,320
I dont know. I like just strays
and they like me.

177
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,380
They like you because you feed them.

178
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,680
You got no heart.

179
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,580
Hey, girls!

180
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,500
Hey Gabriel!

181
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,940
Meet Major.

182
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,830
Major, Gabriel.

183
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,700
We used to have a dog.

184
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,190
Seriously?

185
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,810
I had you down as more of a cat person.

186
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,480
You don't talk about that stuff.

187
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
What?

188
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,730
- Your past.
- I don't remember much.

189
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,700
Just fragments, bits and pieces.

190
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,070
What about family?

191
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,710
My parents, they died
bringing us to this country.

192
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,460
Our boat sank in the harbor.

193
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,700
I almost drowned.

194
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,880
I feel it's like...

195
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,370
there is always this thick fog
over my memory.

196
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,870
And I can't seen through it.

197
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,270
You are lucky.

198
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,190
Every single day I get
screwed upon my memory.

199
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,880
It's better to be pure.

200
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,800
Like you.

201
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,290
<i>HANKA CENTRAL OFFICE OF ROBOTICS</i>

202
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,600

205
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,970
Your have damaged internal systems.

206
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,610
Maybe next time you can design me better.

207
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,590
- How are you?
- I am fine. I can't feel anything.

208
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,530
No you, in There.

209
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,100
I have been having glitches...

210
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,310
It will pass.

211
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,340
- Have you been taking your medication?
- Yeah.

212
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,930
But these ones are so cycling.
I had two this morning.

213
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,620
- Sound or image?
- Both.

214
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,950
I see it.

215
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,070
You made any unencrypted downloads?

216
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,610
- No. Just delete them from me.
- Consent?

217
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,740
My name is Major Mary Killian.
I give my consent to delete this data.

218
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,310
It's done.

219
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,260
- No big deal.
- What are they?

220
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,720
Sensory echoes from your mind, shadows.

221
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,070
I'm not sure.

222
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,100
How do you know what's a glitch
and what's me?

223
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,120
The glitches have a different texture...

224
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,390
to the rest of your code.

225
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,200
I can see everything.

226
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,890
All of your thoughts, your... decisions.

227
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,210
I guess privacy is just for humans.

228
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,130
You are human.

229
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,260
People see you as human.

230
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,800
Everyone around me seems to fit.

231
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,610
They seem connected to something.
Something I...

232
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,350
am not..

233
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,940
- Like I have no past.
- Of course you have a past.

234
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,640
And at time you'll feel more more
connected to it and to them.

235
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,270
Opens and close, please.

236
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,420
We cling to memories
as if they define us, but...

237
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,280
They really don't.

238
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,060
What we do is what defines us.

239
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,670
<i>You're entering a Hanka secure area.

240
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,140
<i>Please disable communication enhancement.</i>

241
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,250
I'm busy.

242
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,870
Dr. Dahlin! Are you finished yet?

243
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,290
If you hadn't riddled the Geisha
with bullets,

244
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,400
This would be much easier.

245
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,010
- I didn't shoot him.
- I did.

246
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,240
This is gonna take days.

247
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,160
I need to run hundreds
of potential simulations.

248
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,520
We don't have the time.

249
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,790
She was a Hanka companion bot.

250
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,360
But she was reprogrammed
for cerebral hacking.

251
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,160
What was on her drives?

252
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,160
Nothing. The data was destroyed
as it was transmitted.

253
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,230
No sign of what she was up to.

254
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,780
The hardware was vandalized.

255
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,150
They ripped her up.

256
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,440
Then I have to do a deep dive.

257
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,420
You can't encrypt during a deep dive.

258
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,060
I know it.

259
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,940
They could left traps in her.
Mag pulses, viruses.

260
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,380
She is right.

261
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:02,190
You will be exposing your mind to
who ever hacked her. You'll be wide open.

262
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,710
I have to get inside her memory.
It's the fastest way to find Kuze.

263
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,110
It's too dangerous.

264
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,800
And highly irresponsible.

265
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,100
Are you sure?

266
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,770
You see any bad code headed my way,
pull me out.

267
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,510
How come you're the one sweating?

268
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,750
Run it.

269
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,720
Cyber mind connection to the Major,
now active...

270
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,730
and unencrypted

271
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,350
consent required for data download.

272
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,770
My name is Major Mira Killian
and I give my consent.

273
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,870
Disconnect. Get her out.

274
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,350
- Get her out!
- I'm trying, but she's being hacked.

275
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,650
Get her out now!

276
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,910
Now!

277
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,070
Are you okay?

278
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,610
I know where he is.

279
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,198
I know this place.

280
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,173
They run black market mech.

281
00:28:26,553 --> 00:28:28,374
- You tooled up?
- Yep.

282
00:28:28,476 --> 00:28:30,612
Target's in the basement,
I'll lead.

283
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:32,076
Switching in my comms.

284
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:35,740
- Hope you've been practicing.
- That's unfair.

285
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,181
Just takes me a moment to...

286
00:28:39,472 --> 00:28:40,860
get the hang of it.

287
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,390
Two mercs at the doors.
Armed and enhanced.

288
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,210
Copy that. We got it covered.

289
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,840
There's a lot of heat in here
for a nightclub.

290
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,310
It's a Yakuza club. What did you expect?

291
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,110
I quite like the place.

292
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,390
Why doesn't that surprise me?

293
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:22,260
I am gonna have to draw some attention.
See if I can access the basement that way.

294
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,350
You're not here
looking for any trouble, are you?

295
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,440
I am just here for the girls... and beer.

296
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,320
- Can I help you?
- I am looking for someone.

297
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,860
You've been here before?

298
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,480
My friend had some mech work done here.
Industry stuff.

299
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,390
We don't do mech work here.

300
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,450
My mistake.

301
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,390
Why don't you come have fun with us?
We will have some privacy.

302
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,620
I'm in.

303
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,800
I'll be here when you need me.

304
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,480
- You say your friend worked here?
- I said my friend had work done here.

305
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,950
She's human?

306
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,970
Your friend.

307
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,520
Now what's that supposed to mean?

308
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,850
Batou.

309
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,300
Can you hear me?

310
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,340
Who did this stunning work on you?

311
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,380
It is divine.

312
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,610
Ladriya... guns.

313
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,860
Here.

314
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,550
Batou, I'm losing signal.

315
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,850
Don't worry sweety.

316
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,330
We have privacy.

317
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,140
Listen.

318
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,900
No signal is going in or out.

319
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,530
Major, I'm in position. Do you copy?

320
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,740
Beer.

321
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,950
If you don't answer,
you're gonna hurt my feelings.

322
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,140
Ladriya, do you have major on Comms?

323
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,940
Got nothing. The signal is still blocked.

324
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,170
I am afraid I get bored
rather easily, so...

325
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,440
You don't wanna talk...

326
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,400
Maybe you wanna dance!

327
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,840
Major, come on. Answer me.

328
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,750
I thought you said no trouble.

329
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,850
Dance!

330
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,700
The truth is...

331
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,990
I wasn't built to dance.

332
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,920
Back on comms.
I am heading to the back room.

333
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,890
I missed you. I'll meet you there.

334
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,590
<i>Collaborate with Hanka Robotics
and be destroyed.</i>

335
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,390
Major?

336
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,890
Where is Batou?

337
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,710
In enhancement, next door.
He is doing well

338
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,770
you took most of the blast.

339
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,650
I saw him down there.

340
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,820
It was like...

341
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,380
He waited to see me.

342
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,020
We synaptic scanned you.

343
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,660
Everything you witnessed
went to Section 9 to evaluate.

344
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,230
You know, the scan...

345
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,820
Also turned up the number of glitches.

346
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,550
They've been getting worse.

347
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,680
Since when?

348
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,270
Since the deep dive.

349
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,530
Do any of the glitches
mean something to you?

350
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,050
No.

351
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
They don't.

352
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,240
You have been inside
the same shell as he has.

353
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,770
That could have very serious consequences.

354
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,930
You were not authorized
to deep dive the geisha.

355
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,790
You're disappointed.

356
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,020
No, I'm worried.

357
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,350
You're not invulnerable.

358
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,900
I can repair your body,
but I can't protect your mind.

359
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,000
Why not?

360
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,750
You can see all my thoughts so...

361
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,200
You should be able to secure them.

362
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,610
Try and understand your importance Mira.

363
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,590
You're what everyone will become one day.

364
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,120
You don't know how alone
that makes me feel.

365
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,850
I can see you out there, you know.

366
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,540
How many fingers am I holding up?

367
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,830
Funny.

368
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,940
Say something nice.

369
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,040
You chose those?

370
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,970
They are tactical.

371
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,040
- Always for the job.
- What else I got?

372
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,540
- They suit you.
- Yeah?

373
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,370
I got night vision...

374
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,670
and X-rays.

375
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,500
I guess I see like you now.

376
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,630
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

377
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,900
Thanks for saving my ass.

378
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,770
Glad to see you're okay...

379
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,120
Major?

380
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,430
Could you feed the dogs for me?

381
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,520
I don't wanna scare them.

382
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,120
Anytime.

383
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,060
Are you insufficiently funded, Mr. Aramaki?

384
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,950
Is section 9 missing some
critical operational resource?

385
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,150
<i>We have everything that we require.</i>

386
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,700
Major is our most sophisticated weapon
only if she is intact.

387
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,070
And Dr. Ouelet informed me...

388
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,220
That you let her dive a corrupted geisha.

389
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,700
You realize there is a premium importance

390
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,550
that Hanka represents to this government.

391
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,260
Major is the is the future of my company.

392
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,660
If you compromise your systems again...

393
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,280
I will burn this section.

394
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,150
<i>Yes sir.</i>

395
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,510
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

396
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,200
<i>Be careful who is the threat.</i>

397
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,360
<i>I am accountable to the Prime Minister,
not to Hanka.</i>

398
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,130
<i>Create your own beauty.
Beauty enhanced.</i>

399
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,400
Are you human?

400
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:33,990
Yeah.

401
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,500
Can you take that off?

402
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,180
So I can see your face?

403
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,470
What does that feel like?

404
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,860
It feels...

405
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,720
different.

406
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,790
What are you?

407
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,440
<i>SECURE PROJECT 2571</i>

408
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,150
<i>HANKA PERSONNEL FILES</i>

409
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,850
Look at me.

410
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,160
Tell me what they took from me.

411
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,260
I am sorry. They never told us.

412
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:41,250
It feels weird driving with these eyes.

413
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,400
Why do you take that?

414
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,700
Um, keeps my brain
from rejecting this body.

415
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,050
Major, Batou, you need to get here.

416
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,390
What you got?

417
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:58,020
Another Hanka scientist
has been found dead.

418
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,590
It's Dahlin.

419
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,110
Got it.

420
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,920
Major this way.

421
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,430
<i>SECURE - PROJECT 2571</i>

422
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,090
What is that?

423
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,860
She found what Kuze stole from Osmond.

424
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,420
It's a list of everyone
who worked on a project called 2571.

425
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,420
That's who he's targeting.

426
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,720
Is there anyone else on that list?

427
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,330
<i>Dr. OUELET</i>

428
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,930
Find Oulet. Now!

429
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,100
She is in transit. Her comms are down.

430
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,810
<i>I'm looking at her and I'm thinking...</i>

431
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,270
<i>"You want me to for pay for violin too".</i>

432
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,850
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

433
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,530
<i>I love that kid to pieces.</i>

434
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,720
<i>I do. She is amazing.</i>

435
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,950
<i>But when she practices that thing,
it's painful right?</i>

436
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,030
<i>Why not piano?</i>

437
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:28,830
<i>I mean, it's the same price, you know.
And doesn't sound so bad.</i>

438
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,530
<i>At least if you can't play that proper,
it sounds...</i>

439
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,490
<i>2-5-7-1!
Tell me everything!</i>

440
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,460
<i>Are you prepare
to die for 2-5-7...?</i>

441
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,570
Go!

442
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,630
Go!

443
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,540
Who is Kuze?

444
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,290
- Why does he want to kill Ouelet?
- I don't know anything.

445
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,010
Enough, enough!

446
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,620
We need him alive.

447
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,090
Please. I have been trough this.

448
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,260
You have the wrong guy.

449
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,800
So tell us who we do have.

450
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,580
My name is Lee Cunningham.

451
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,260
- Where'd you get the weapons?
- I don't know.

452
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,170
Who loaded the mines?

453
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,680
I don't know anything about the weapons,
alright I told you.

454
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,370
I was picking up my daughter.
She takes violin lessons.

455
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,040
What's her name?

456
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,140
- Is this her?
- Yeah.

457
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,780
Isn't she a little angel?

458
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,020
- This is your daughter?
- Right.

459
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,240
Do you have that?

460
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,060
Where do you live?

461
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,660
I can't remember.

462
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,960
I think it's a tall place.
Is it a tall building?

463
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,060
It's a tall place, right?

464
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,970
You don't have a child.

465
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,150
You have no wife. You live alone,
It's just you.

466
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,900
- What? No.
- We went to your apartment.

467
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,330
- There was nobody there.
- No.

468
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,950
You live there for
10 years by yourself.

469
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:29,220
No.

470
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,620
- You're just lying.
- I'm not lying.

471
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,290
I didn't kill anyone!

472
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,810
- Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Holocube disconnect.

473
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,240
Please!

474
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,950
I didn't do anything.

475
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,797
Why do you keep saying this to me?

476
00:49:43,997 --> 00:49:45,840
I don't understand.
How can he not know?

477
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:49,920
The hack must have created a vacuum.
Kuze's wiped his memory...

478
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,850
and somehow installed a new reality.

479
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:56,640
At least he got to believe he had a kid.

480
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,410
What's the difference huh?

481
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,910
Fantasy, reality?

482
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,090
Dreams, memories?

483
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,720
It's all the same.

484
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,080
Just noise.

485
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,080
It's him.

486
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,610
He is in there.

487
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,840
This cube is secure.
He can't be, Major.

488
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,560
Lie Detector.

489
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,779
He must have hacked in that way.

490
00:50:25,937 --> 00:50:28,789
We should uplink to the machine,
trace the code, get a lock on his location.

491
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,160
Do it.

492
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,630
Don't go in there.
It's too dangerous.

493
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,760
<i>Major</i>

494
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,680
<i>We don't know what else he can do.</i>

495
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,990
The signal is unstable.
Can you get the lock on him?

496
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,360
We gotta move fast. We're losing him.

497
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:55,780
Connecting.

498
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,730
Who are you?

499
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,030
Come here.

500
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,730
I'm shy.

501
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,070
I'm not beautiful...

502
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,580
like you.

503
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,580
Tell me who you are.

504
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,800
I have been born more than once.

505
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,070
So I have more than one name.

506
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,120
I'll find you.

507
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,060
Not yet.

508
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,240
I am not done.

509
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,620
The machine is tracing his location.

510
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,200
We got a fix!

511
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,500
I need to see her.

512
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,540
No Please. I know..what...

513
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,990
We got him.

514
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,310
Let's go.

515
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,020
Weapons up.

516
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,240
- Go.
- On me.

517
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,150
Stay Down! Stay Down!

518
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,850
Put it down, put it down.

519
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:24,470
Grenade!

520
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,360
Major!

521
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,170
Come in.

522
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,430
I know why we could not find him.

523
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,510
He is using human minds
to create a network of his own.

524
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,150
We're coming to your position.

525
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,220
Tell me who you are.

526
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:59,090
I'm that what you seek to destroy.

527
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:05,370
In this life, my name is...

528
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,480
Kuze.

529
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:12,140
What are you doing to me?

530
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:20,000
I have, connected you,
to a network of my own creation.

531
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,680
When I am finished in this world...

532
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:27,350
my ghost can survive
there and regenerate.

533
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,970
What do you want from me?

534
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:32,610
I became...

535
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,890
Fascinated with you...

536
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,170
Reading your code...

537
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:42,070
when you were inside that geisha.

538
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:48,250
Like nothing I had felt before,
yet so...

539
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:50,440
Familiar.

540
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,820
We are the same.

541
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,940
We are not the same.

542
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,580
You kill innocent people.

543
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,700
Innocent? Is that the...
what you call them?

544
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:07,850
I am as they need me.

545
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,410
Who made you?

546
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,620
What have they told you?

547
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,250
That you were the first?

548
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,180
The first cerebral salvage.

549
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:22,800
You were born of lessons...
they took.

550
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,690
from my failure.

551
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,360
What are you talking about?

552
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,750
I was conscious while they
dismembered my body, and discarded me

553
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,020
like garbage.

554
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,670
I was lying on a table...

555
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:45,910
Listening to doctors talk about how
my mind had not meshed with the shell.

556
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,260
That they had built.

557
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:52,570
how project t-two, five, seven, one...

558
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,360
had failed...

559
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,040
and they had to move on...

560
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:04,530
to you.

561
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:14,150
What a beauty you are.

562
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,720
They have improved us so much...

563
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,850
since they made me.

564
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,170
They thought that we would be
a part of their evolution.

565
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:31,850
But they have created us...

566
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,550
to evolve alone...

567
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:40,810
beyond them.

568
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,790
Evolution? That's what you call?

569
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,540
Killing everyone who made you?

570
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,250
You are not listening to me.

571
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,350
You are murderer.

572
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,650
They tried to kill me first.

573
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,410
It is self-defense.

574
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,590
The defense of self.

575
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:05,000
More will die...

576
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,050
until they tell me...

577
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,060
what they took.

578
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:12,650
I won't let that happen.

579
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,530
You want to kill me?

580
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,000
Like everyone else.

581
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,990
Do it, then.

582
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,450
Do what you were programmed to do.

583
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,630
What is that?

584
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,340
What is that?

585
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:08,830
I c-c-can't remember,
but I am haunted by it.

586
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,630
Do You see it?

587
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,210
Togusa!

588
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:27,410
Don't take the medication
that they gave you...

589
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,800
They use it to suppress your memories.

590
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:35,100
Your shell belongs to them,
but not your ghost.

591
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:37,550
Your ghost is yours.

592
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,600
Remember that...

593
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,790
and maybe you can remember it all.

594
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,550
Get away from her!
Get down on the ground now.

595
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,820
Major...

596
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,580
Major!

597
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:14,900
How many?

598
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:20,110
Dozens.

599
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:27,180
How manyï?

600
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,500
98 unsuccessful attempts before you.

601
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,080
You killed 98 innocent people.

602
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,730
No, I didn't kill anyone.

603
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,040
You wouldn't be here.

604
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:46,190
You would not exist if it
weren't for those experiments.

605
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:48,000
Experiments?

606
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,090
- Is that what I am to you?
- No!

607
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,770
No, Mira!

608
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,130
Sacrifices were made.

609
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:07,610
Where did the bodies come from?

610
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:11,700
Where did I come from?

611
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,400
Mr. Cutter brought them to us.

612
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,660
I did not ask questions.

613
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:19,250
The harbor.

614
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:21,570
My parents.

615
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,920
The way they died.

616
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,310
Did that happen?

617
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:31,620
No.

618
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,180
We gave you false memories.

619
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:40,200
Cutter wanted to motivate you.

620
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:43,050
To fight terrorists.
I didn't approve.

621
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:46,800
It was cruel, but my work,
that was important, and...

622
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,060
you were born.

623
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,330
You were so beautiful.

624
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,610
Nothing I have is real.

625
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,100
I found him.

626
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,480
I told you to be careful.

627
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:06,460
You knew who he was the whole time.

628
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:07,930
You built him.

629
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,770
He had a...

630
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:13,760
Violent unstable mind.

631
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,990
His cerebral connection wouldn't hold!

632
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:19,560
- I tried to save him!
- No.

633
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,060
You left him to die.

634
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:36,710
<i>Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.
Checking upper zones next.</i>

635
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,930
Is there any word on Major?

636
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,530
<i>She's gone.
Off-grid. Silent.</i>

637
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:47,570
Copy that, sir.

638
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:49,900
I know where to find her.

639
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:35,660
I didn't ask you to come here.

640
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,320
You never ask.

641
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:40,630
But I always do.

642
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,950
Did they send you to bring me in?

643
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,410
I'm just here to fish. Did you see any?

644
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,220
You are a company man, you follow orders.
So, if they ordered you to kill me...

645
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:59,340
Stop saying shit like that.
You're gonna piss me off.

646
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:23,790
What's it like down there?

647
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,290
It's Cold and dark.

648
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,650
Just a million miles away.

649
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:33,460
No voices.

650
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:35,980
No data streaming.

651
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:38,350
Just...

652
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:42,900
nothing.

653
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,360
- It scares me.
- Then Why do you do it?

654
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,790
It feels real.

655
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,660
Why didn't you stop him?

656
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,020
I don't know who to trust anymore.

657
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,730
You trust me, right?

658
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:15,670
Yes I do.

659
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:20,650
I just don't like it.

660
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:30,990
I need you to take me back.

661
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,110
There is more I need to find out.

662
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,870
Sure.

663
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,390
Dr. Ouelet...

664
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,780
What have you told her?

665
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:04,710
She knows.

666
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,410
I'm bringing her in.

667
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:40,020
Hanka security to Headquarters.

668
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:42,880
We have the Major.

669
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,660
Why is she sedated?

670
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,640
She's been turned by a terrorist.

671
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:27,340
But you know that already.

672
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:32,660
You should have called
the first time she came to see you.

673
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:35,660
Instead, you gave
her information.

674
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,040
What makes you think you have the...

675
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,810
- Right to tell me that?
- 2-5-7-1 took us close.

676
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,430
It's time to move on to the next iteration.

677
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:43,970
2-5-7-1 is not a failure.

678
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,160
I will delete all the
data and reprogram her.

679
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:49,370
- She won't remember him at all.
- No, no, no, no.

680
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:52,780
You download all the data
on the terrorist...

681
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:55,100
and then I order you to terminate.

682
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,750
- What?
- We'll build one that's better.

683
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:05,650
- I'll delete everything.
- You deleted before.

684
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,150
- She's mine.
- No.

685
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:13,660
She is a contract... with me.

686
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,560
We succeeded.

687
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,280
She is more than human... and more than AI.

688
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:23,680
We change her entire identity.
But her ghost survived!

689
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:26,140
Her ghost is what failed us.

690
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,200
We can not control her.
She is no longer a viable asset.

691
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,050
You should be the one to do it.

692
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:49,630
What are you doing to me?

693
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:53,780
I'll run the standard synaptic.

694
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:56,180
Upload your data on the raid.

695
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:59,910
I'll find out exactly what Kuze told you.

696
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,830
You know what he told me.

697
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:04,630
The truth.

698
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,620
You're deleting everything, aren't you?

699
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:11,950
No.

700
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:16,680
So I don't remember...

701
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,640
You.

702
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,580
My name is Major Mira Killian...

703
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,770
And I do not consent
to the deletion of this data.

704
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:39,060
I do not consent.

705
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,530
I do not consent.

706
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:46,670
We never needed your consent.

707
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,500
Yours or anyones.

708
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:59,010
You're killing me...

709
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,750
Right you...?

710
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:22,360
Mira?

711
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:26,100
Do you hear me?

712
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:31,090
Mira?

713
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:37,080
This is your past, your real past. Take it.

714
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:40,250
- Guards!
- Come on, come on!

715
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:41,710
Come on, go!

716
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,080
Go!

717
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,680
Go!

718
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,410
<i>Security alert on level 25.</i>

719
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,920
<i>Initiating Lockdown procedure.</i>

720
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,050
<i>Please relocate to your
designated safe room.</i>

721
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,410
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

722
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:18,360
That's the problem with the human heart.

723
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,420
<i>I want to see her scan.</i>

724
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,370
She killed Dr. Ouelet.

725
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,400
You are to have no further contact with her.
Hanka security will hunt her from here.

726
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,800
- What are the orders?
- To terminate on sight.

727
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,600
You want to kill her? You built her!

728
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,030
- Have your sergeant stand down.
- The Major would never hurt Dr. Oulete.

729
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,980
She is not the major anymore!

730
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:20,080
We have a section 9 operative
under terrorist programming.

731
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,090
This goes public your unit goes down.

732
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:26,480
<i>You kill her...</i>

733
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:28,580
<i>You kill us.</i>

734
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,730
I'll take that under advice.

735
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,040
So what now?

736
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,900
Oh, the pup pumpkin.

737
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,670
Oh, you surprised me.

738
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:39,210
She likes you.

739
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,090
I was looking for...

740
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,280
No, come in.

741
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,130
Yeah, go, come come.

742
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,800
- Can I offer you some tea?
- Okay.

743
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,260
That... Motoko's room.

744
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,280
My daughter died a year ago.

745
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,650
I am Sorry.

746
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,870
She run away.

747
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,610
She was a difficult.

748
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,940
We fought.

749
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:29,260
But I guess we all fight
with our parents, right?

750
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,190
Please come on the sit.

751
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:55,180
What happened to your her?

752
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,640
I don't know.

753
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
The ministry sent me her ashes, and...

754
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:07,960
They told me she took her own life.

755
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:14,470
But Motoko... No, no, no.

756
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,760
I never believe them.

757
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,330
She was happy...

758
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,070
living in the lawless
zone with her friends.

759
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,270
She'd write her manifestos about...

760
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:31,040
how technology was...

761
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:34,110
destroying the world.

762
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:37,740
Then one day...

763
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:40,150
the police came...

764
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,220
and they run.

765
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,930
It's strange.

766
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:02,360
I see her in so many young women.

767
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,460
On the street, in my dreams.

768
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,640
As if she is still here.

769
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:12,340
She was...

770
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:14,530
fearless.

771
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,040
And wild.

772
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:22,160
You remind me of her.

773
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:24,740
Sorry.

774
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,260
How do I remind you of her?

775
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:35,620
The way you look at me.

776
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:43,070
Who are you?

777
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,200
I don't know.

778
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:51,360
Wait, wait, wait!

779
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,800
Will you come again to visit me?

780
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,760
I will.

781
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,710
Aramaki.

782
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,660
Listen to me.

783
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:31,630
I was never in a terrorist bombing.

784
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,340
My parents...

785
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,610
Everything was data
they installed in my mind.

786
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:41,970
And there were others.
Run-aways like me...

787
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,570
considered disposable.

788
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,160
Kuze was one of them.
That's why he's coming.

789
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,470
For Hanka.

790
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:53,690
<i>Can you prove this?</i>

791
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,760
Dr. Ouelet can.

792
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:57,970
<i>Ouelet's dead.</i>

793
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:05,950
<i>Cutter says you killed her.</i>

794
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,170
Put me on the grid. I need Kuze to find me.

795
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,900
<i>We will be exposed to Cutter.</i>

796
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:20,210
I know, but I have to do this.

797
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,320
<i>I'm going to meet with the Prime Minister.</i>

798
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:28,310
<i>He must be stopped.</i>

799
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,700
The virus has spread.

800
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:02,380
<i>All agents stick to mental comms.</i>

801
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,250
<i>Don't send a rabbit...</i>

802
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:47,650
<i>to kill a fox.</i>

803
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:57,850
<i>We are burned.</i>

804
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,780
<i>I repeat.</i>

805
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:03,910
<i>We are burned.</i>

806
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:09,240
We have located Major on the grid.
She's in the lawless zone.

807
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:11,680
Air support 5 minutes out.

808
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,880
Is the spider tank within range?

809
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,560
Yes sir. Awaiting your orders sir.

810
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:24,880
Motoko!

811
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:34,770
It is real.

812
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:40,060
This place.

813
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:50,170
I remember what they did to us.

814
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:55,040
Cutter and his men.
This is where they took us from.

815
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:03,730
We used to sleep right here.

816
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:07,550
We were like a family.

817
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:09,780
All of us run away.

818
01:26:11,410 --> 01:26:12,960
We had nothing...

819
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:18,590
except each other.

820
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,260
They took that from us.

821
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:42,540
Your name was Hideo.

822
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:55,410
Motoko.

823
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,870
That was your name.

824
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,760
Motoko.

825
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,110
Come with me...

826
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:13,290
into my network.

827
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:16,610
We will evolve beyond them.

828
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:21,990
And together we can avenge
what they have done to us.

829
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,760
Come...

830
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:25,750
with me.

831
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:45,320
I will take control from here.

832
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:47,630
<i>Weapons system manual command.</i>

833
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,440
<i>Spider tank now active</i>

834
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:02,320
It's Cutter! He found us!

835
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:41,900
<i>Target acquired</i>

836
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:45,240
No!

837
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:56,580
<i>Target eliminated.</i>

838
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,180
You came close...

839
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:15,740
you freak.

840
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,360
<i>Motor center compromised.</i>

841
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:35,330
Sniper team on site?

842
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:38,220
Approaching the target now sir.

843
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:42,100
Come with me.

844
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,420
There is no place for us here.

845
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,490
No.

846
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:00,600
I'm not ready to leave.

847
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,850
I belong here.

848
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:10,350
I'll always be there with you...

849
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:13,160
your ghost.

850
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:20,920
Target is in view.

851
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:22,800
What are you waiting for?

852
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:24,010
Do it!

853
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:27,940
No!

854
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,090
Keep firing.

855
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:35,220
<i>Saito, have you found Major? Is she safe?</i>

856
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:38,980
She will be.

857
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:02,530
Hey...

858
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:06,060
Hey.

859
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,810
Say something nice.

860
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:14,750
What's your name?

861
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:18,680
Aramaki told me you had a name from before.

862
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:24,300
Motoko.

863
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,070
Major still in there, right?

864
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:34,480
I am.

865
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:51,240
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

866
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:54,010
<i>I talked with the Prime Minister.</i>

867
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:57,600
<i>You are accused of murder
and crimes against the state.</i>

868
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:04,210
I thought that it might be you.

869
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:10,500
<i>It is unwise to resist.</i>

870
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:31,790
Please.

871
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,410
<i>Major?</i>

872
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,310
<i>I am with Cutter.</i>

873
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,110
<i>Do you wanna say anything
before I kill him?</i>

874
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,950
Tell him this is justice.

875
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,480
It's what I was built for.

876
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:47,940
So do you give consent?

877
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,530
My name is Major.

878
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:53,400
And I give my consent.

879
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:06,800
You don't have to come here anymore.

880
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,120
I know.

881
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,370
My mind is human.

882
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,920
My body is manufactured.

883
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:55,900
I am the first of my kind, but...

884
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,270
I won't be the last.

885
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:07,060
We cling to memories
as if they define us.

886
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:11,210
But what we do defines us.

887
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:20,760
My ghost survived
to remind the next of us...

888
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,830
that humanity is our virtue.

889
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:28,600
I know who I am...

890
01:37:29,650 --> 01:37:31,480
and what I'm here to do.

891
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:36,820
<i>Major.</i>

892
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:38,850
<i>Engage targets.</i>

893
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:55,270
<i>You're authorized.</i>
