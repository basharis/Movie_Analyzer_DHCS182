1
00:03:14,442 --> 00:03:15,787
<i>The fielder's running after the ball...</i>

2
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:17,632
<i>but the ball's already
across the boundary line.</i>

3
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,690
<i>This has happened often.</i>

4
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:25,273
<i>If Pakistan wants to win the match then they
don't have a better batsman than Afridi.</i>

5
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:30,523
<i>Shahid Afridi will
have to take charge here.</i>

6
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,773
<i>No one can doubt his ability.</i>

7
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:35,273
<i>But today is his opportunity
to show the world..</i>

8
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,273
<i>Yes... the game can change any moment.</i>

9
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:43,148
<i>Slow ball and Afridi has hit it...</i>

10
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:45,523
<i>Excellent shot...
and the ball's across the boundary.</i>

11
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,773
<i>And that's a four.</i>

12
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,107
Bravo

13
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,773
Looks like your son is really eager.

14
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:59,398
Pakistan needs four more balls to win.

15
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,107
Have you thought of a name?

16
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:03,773
Shahid!

17
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:06,273
Why are you laughing?

18
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,273
What if it's a girl?

19
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:10,523
- Girl?
- Hmmmm

20
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:13,898
<i>Last ball... and Shahid
Afridi has swung his bat.</i>

21
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:17,149
Congratulations.

22
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:52,274
What is your name?

23
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,774
It's Shahida.

24
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:59,649
Shahida! What a cute name?

25
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,774
Where are you from?

26
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,274
You will only talk
to your mother not me?

27
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:12,608
No... it's not that.

28
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,274
She doesn't talk to her mother either.

29
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,649
Why?

30
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:34,149
Shahida, it'll be dark soon.

31
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:37,274
Go home.
I'll bring your kids home

32
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,149
Rauf.

33
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:23,357
Rauf, where's Shahida?

34
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:26,357
- She hasn't returned home yet?
- No, she hasn't.

35
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:32,524
Shahida!

36
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,857
- Shahida!
- Shahida!

37
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:40,982
Shahida!

38
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:50,149
Rauf!

39
00:06:51,275 --> 00:06:53,274
Rauf! Shahida!

40
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:57,524
- Rauf!
- Shahida?

41
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:03,274
- Shahida, Rauf
- Wait.

42
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:05,233
- Rauf! Shahida!
- Just wait.

43
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,315
Since when have I been
telling you to take her

44
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:18,399
...to Delhi's Hazrat
Nizamuddin Auliya's shrine.

45
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:21,482
Even the mute start talking there.

46
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,982
I was five and hadn't spoken a word.

47
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:26,940
And I was taken there.

48
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:28,899
And you began to speak?

49
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,024
Would you like to
hear me say something?

50
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,024
But Delhi's in India now.

51
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:35,274
So what?

52
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:37,315
It's not in America, is it?

53
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:39,274
It's easier to go to America, father.

54
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,274
It was different earlier,
it was the same country.

55
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:44,649
And you're forgetting that
I served in the army for 5 years.

56
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:47,774
The Indians won't give me a visa.

57
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:51,357
I will take her.

58
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,524
At any cost..

59
00:07:58,025 --> 00:08:03,774
I'll do anything so that
my girl can speak, go to school.

60
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,358
I have decided.

61
00:08:11,816 --> 00:08:13,774
I will take Shahida to Delhi.

Just see.

75
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:56,774
Your daughter will chirp like a bird..

76
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,982
...as soon as she gets to Pakistan.

77
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,107
God willing.

78
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:03,774
God willing

79
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,566
Why has the train stopped?

80
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,149
It's nothing, Ma'am

81
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:11,649
The tracks ahead
are undergoing repairs.

82
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:13,774
It'll be fixed soon, don't worry.

83
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:14,857
Go to sleep!

84
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,649
Fine, let's all sleep.

85
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:22,024
Shahida.

86
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:39,065
Shahida!

87
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:40,024
What happened?

88
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:41,982
I can't find my daughter.
Shahida!

89
00:14:42,317 --> 00:15:01,107
Shahida!

90
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:14,232
Pull the chain!

91
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:38,149
The Indians are saying
they didn't find your daughter.

92
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,357
But they will look
again in the morning.

93
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:44,649
Sir, please listen to me.

94
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:47,274
It's just five minutes away.

95
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,399
Please let me go,
I will look for her myself...

96
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,899
It maybe 5 minutes away,
but it's across the border.

97
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,274
In a different country.

98
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:54,899
So what if it's a different country?

99
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:56,774
I want my daughter back.

100
00:15:57,067 --> 00:16:00,232
Try to understand ma'am,
you'll need a fresh visa to go back.

101
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,399
Be patient,
your child will be found.

102
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,107
How?

103
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:06,482
You don't get it.

104
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,982
My child can't speak.

105
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,649
She's absolutely alone
in an unfamiliar country.

106
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:14,899
You all can do nothing.

107
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:17,066
I will find Shahida myself.

108
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:20,149
- Stop her.
- Shahida!

109
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,899
Shahida!

110
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,482
Calm down! Have faith in God.

111
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,649
Calm down, dear.

112
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:39,024
There must be some god-sent in India.

113
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:42,982
...who will look after our Shahida.

114
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:45,774
Calm down.

196
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,399
Brother, what's a selfie?

197
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:30,233
When you take your own'... picture

198
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:32,149
That's a selfie.

199
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:35,274
Brother, you were dancing like a star.

200
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,649
I always get immersed
in the devotion of Bajrang Bali.

201
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:39,024
Yes, brother.

202
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,524
Please get bread for the kid.

203
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:25,774
Yes, brother.

204
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:29,524
But she's asking for two.

205
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:36,899
You must have a name.

206
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:38,565
Sita-Gita.

207
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,815
Payal-Puja.

208
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,024
Brother, I think she's deaf.

209
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:44,524
She heard me order the bread?

210
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:45,858
Yes, that's true.

211
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:47,149
Let me ask.

212
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:56,649
Name?

213
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:00,815
She's illiterate.

214
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:02,399
Why don't you write
it in Sanskrit instead?

215
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:03,899
She's a 5 year old kid.

216
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:08,149
Eat all you want.

217
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,149
Why are you following me again?

218
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:31,358
Oh...

219
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:34,649
...here you are.

220
00:23:42,441 --> 00:23:44,149
Did you get separated
from your parents?

221
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,274
Say something.

222
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:53,108
What is this mess?

223
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:00,733
Now you're under
Bajrang Bali's refuge.

224
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,233
This is a miraculous temple.

225
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,858
Your parents must be looking for you,
just like you are looking for them.

226
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:10,274
They will come here.

227
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:13,274
Just join your hands... and sit here.

228
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:16,149
Like this.

229
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,274
And I...

230
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:25,024
I'll be seeing you.

231
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:33,608
If it takes them longer,
then eat that apple.

232
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:35,733
Don't stay hungry.

233
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:45,524
Come on.

234
00:24:54,941 --> 00:24:56,774
Stop the bus!

235
00:25:09,816 --> 00:25:10,899
No, no, no, no!

236
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:14,233
You can't leave this child here.
- Why not?

237
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:17,108
Her parents will come here
to file a complaint, right?

238
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,149
And what if they don't?

239
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:21,024
If they don't? Why?

240
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:22,524
Why not?

241
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:24,024
Look at her face.

242
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:35,399
That's fine, but still..

243
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:38,358
...you can't leave her here.
- Why not?

244
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:40,274
Look at her face.

245
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:44,274
And now see their faces.

246
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:49,649
Criminals,
thieves, drunkards, pickpockets.

247
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:52,649
And this is a Police Station,
not an orphanage.

248
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:57,440
But... - Well, write down
your details on this.

249
00:25:57,441 --> 00:26:00,399
If I find out anything about this kid,
I will call you up personally.

250
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:01,774
And till then?

251
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:03,274
Till then...

252
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,399
Hail Lord Ram!

253
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,233
Hail Lord Ram?

254
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:17,608
This isn't your home?

255
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:21,149
Where is it?

256
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:23,233
Must be somewhere.

257
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:28,483
I know, I'll tell you names of cities.

258
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:31,315
And if your home is
any one of these places..

259
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:33,190
...then just raise your hand.

260
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,399
How?

261
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:37,524
Okay.

262
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:39,899
Delhi.

263
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:42,524
Meerut.

264
00:26:44,441 --> 00:26:45,649
Faridabad.

265
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,399
Gwalior.

266
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:55,065
Jhansi. Patiala.
Amritsar. Jodhpur. Jaipur.

267
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:57,899
Srinagar, Pathankot, Shimla, Ambala.

268
00:26:58,816 --> 00:26:59,899
Baroda?

269
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:01,399
Rampur?

270
00:27:01,691 --> 00:27:03,149
Is it Dehradoon?

271
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:04,774
Kasauli?

272
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,399
Pratapgarh.

273
00:27:07,191 --> 00:27:08,899
Are you from Pratapgarh?
- Yes.

274
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:10,524
Me too.
- Really?

275
00:27:10,691 --> 00:27:12,065
Swear on Bajrang Bali.

276
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:13,190
I live next to Neeli Phatak.

277
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:14,774
That's where my in-law's home is.

278
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:16,774
That makes us relatives.

279
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:20,149
These days I am staying in Delhi.

280
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,024
Why Delhi?

281
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:22,274
Job... or girl?

282
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:26,024
It's a long story.

283
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:28,608
Tell us, It's not like
we are waiting to catch a bus.

284
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:31,024
Yeah, tell us.

285
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,274
Tell us.

286
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:34,065
You don't say anything?

287
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,358
Would you like to hear our story?

288
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:38,774
I am Pawan.

289
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:40,483
Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi.

290
00:27:40,941 --> 00:27:42,983
But everyone calls me Bajrangi.

291
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:45,524
You can call me brother..

292
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,233
How old are you?

293
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:49,399
Six!

294
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,524
Then you call me uncle.

295
00:27:51,816 --> 00:27:53,149
Uncle will be right.

296
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:57,024
My father, Diwakar Chaturvedi..

297
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:58,899
...was the postmaster in Pratapgarh.

298
00:27:59,441 --> 00:28:03,233
♪ Come and take it. ♪

299
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:06,190
His name justified his qualities.

300
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:08,690
My father knew all the four Vedas.

301
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:11,524
But I couldn't even
remember the 4 times tables.

302
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:13,274
Four eights are..

303
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,024
Twenty Two.

304
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:17,483
No!
Twenty-five.

305
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:18,940
No, twenty-seven.

306
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:20,190
Twenty-eight... Thirty.

307
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:21,899
Father!

308
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:29,399
For father, physical health
was as important as mental wellness.

309
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:31,649
Bravo. Come on.

310
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:38,358
Scholar plus Wrestler. Wow!

311
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:40,399
But I failed in that too.

312
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:42,024
Hold him.

313
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:45,149
Stop laughing. Pawan.

314
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:51,774
Forget it. You will never learn.

315
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,565
You can never do anything.

316
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:57,524
How can I help it
if I feel ticklish while wrestling!

317
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:03,774
<i>But this glory wasn't enough for
Mr. Chaturvedi.</i>

318
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:07,524
<i>My father was also the chief
of the Pratapgarh branch.</i>

319
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:16,608
<i>Neither education,
nor wrestling or politics.</i>

320
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:19,774
I wasn't interested
in any of father's subjects.

321
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,149
That's why he gave me a special name.

322
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:22,774
What?

323
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:24,149
Zero!

324
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,233
What happened?

325
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:31,858
Fail!

326
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:35,815
It took me 20 years
to pass 10th High school.

327
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:39,024
Between High school and graduation..

328
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:40,774
...I failed 10 times.

329
00:29:41,191 --> 00:29:43,815
By now father had also given up on me.

330
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,024
What happened?

331
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:46,524
Fail!

332
00:29:47,191 --> 00:29:48,274
Did you pass?

333
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:56,399
Fail!

334
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,399
Oh, God!

335
00:29:57,566 --> 00:29:58,899
Fail!

336
00:30:02,691 --> 00:30:08,149
My friends told me to cheat... but, I was
A devotee of Bajrang Bali after all

337
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:11,524
I said, I would rather
fail than cheat.

338
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:14,274
<i>So I attempted the exams 11th time.</i>

339
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,524
Welcome.

340
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:25,649
I am sure you've broken
your own record in failing.

341
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,149
Father... - When you have
already failed 10 times..

342
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:33,274
...why did you have to humiliate
me again, for the 11th time.

343
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:34,524
Why?

344
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,358
I've accepted that you're a fool,
that you're stupid and useless.

345
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:43,315
You're a zero.

346
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:46,483
Listen.
- What? Hear what?

347
00:30:46,775 --> 00:30:48,858
You have failed 10 times.

348
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,399
And failed me 20 times.

349
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:56,024
Listen to me, father.
- What's left to hear or say anymore?

350
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:59,774
If you want to do something for me..

351
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:05,108
...then do me a favor and go away,
to Delhi.

352
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:09,399
I have heard that there is a dearth
of useless people in that city.

353
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:10,774
I have a friend there.

354
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:12,233
Dayanand.

355
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:14,524
He will get you a job some where

356
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:16,233
Father, I passed.

357
00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:17,774
Wonderful.

358
00:31:18,066 --> 00:31:20,149
What did your father say?

359
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,274
I am sure Mr. Chaturvedi
must be shocked.

360
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:24,899
I knew he would be shocked.

361
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:28,024
But I never thought he
would be so deeply shocked.

362
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:29,399
Why? What happened?

363
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:36,649
Father...

364
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:39,524
...I am going to Delhi.

365
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,358
And left for Delhi to
fulfill my father's last wish.

366
00:31:46,941 --> 00:31:48,149
To see Dayanand.

Do you have 5 rupees change,
so I can give you 10?

373
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:11,149
No, I don't.

374

What now?
- It's okay, you can keep it.

375

Look, mister.
It's okay. You can keep it.

380

I can't do that.

381
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:30,565
But of this, 5 rupees is yours.

I don't want 5 rupees.

388
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:50,649

No, madam, I..
- What?

414
00:34:32,441 --> 00:34:33,773
I said I don't want the money.

Followed me all the way home.

418
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:41,816
Neither am I following anyone.

419
00:34:41,816 --> 00:34:43,273
I swear on Bajrang Bali.

420
00:34:43,275 --> 00:34:45,023
I am from Pratapgarh,
here to meet Mr. Dayanand.

- Yes. Bajrangi!

Here you go.
- That's all.

426
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,773
Eat some more, it's our specialty.

427
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:03,648
We sprinkle salt while
boiling the potatoes.

428
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,023
That's why they are so good.

429
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:06,773
Please eat.

430
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:14,358
Is someone cooking meat?

431
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:16,108
It's the house next door.

432
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:17,316
They're Muslims.

433
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:18,816
Start cooking early in the morning.

434
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:22,233

437
00:35:32,941 --> 00:35:35,023

No, I teach there.

443
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:48,023
Go with Rasika tomorrow to her school.

444
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:49,773

Along with monkeys; you will
also find a lot of mosquitoes here.

...every girl tries to see the image
of her father in her future husband.

514
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:13,773

516
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,148
Forgive me, Mr. Diwedi.

517
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:28,023
We cannot go ahead with this alliance.

518
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,023
My daughter doesn't want to.

519
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,273

520
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,358

521
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,148
Forgive me.
- Let's go.

522
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:38,023

523
00:42:38,191 --> 00:42:40,233

Sir...

525
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:49,398
You cannot get engaged to Rasika.

526
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,648
Until you're worthy of her.

527
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,273
And my first condition is... a house..

528
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,023
...which you'll buy with
your hard-earned money.

529
00:43:03,566 --> 00:43:05,773
You only have six months.

530
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:10,398
Otherwise... I'll find
someone suitable for her.

531
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,983
By the way, I never asked you before.

532
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,066

533
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:28,273
Bravo, Bajrangi. Congratulations.

00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,523
Wow!

00:43:33,316 --> 00:43:34,566

the rent and deposit money.

00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:39,648
Of course.

540
00:43:39,816 --> 00:43:41,523
Don't worry.

541
00:43:43,566 --> 00:43:49,608
Dhanbad... Etah...
Kalmganj... Agra?

542
00:43:52,316 --> 00:43:53,733
Hail Bajrang Bali.

543
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:30,398
If she can't speak...

544
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,483
then how do you know she's a Brahmin.

545
00:44:34,691 --> 00:44:37,398
She's so fair, must be a Brahmin.

546
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,648
How long is she going to stay here?

547
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,148
Until we don't find her parents?

548
00:44:44,441 --> 00:44:45,773
And when will they be found?

549
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:50,148
When Bajrang Bali wills

550
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:53,648
Have you ever traveled
by an airplane?

551
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:56,773
I did, once.

552
00:44:59,691 --> 00:45:02,148
Do you know what they say?

553
00:45:03,191 --> 00:45:05,273
When the pressure drops...

554
00:45:06,316 --> 00:45:11,358
...first put on your own oxygen mask,
then help others.

555
00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:18,148
How long will you keep
doing social service?

556
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:20,898
Think about your own life.

557
00:45:21,775 --> 00:45:23,398
Get a decent job.

558
00:45:23,691 --> 00:45:25,023
Find a nice home.

559
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,773
And if you can't, then tell me now.

560
00:45:28,816 --> 00:45:32,358
So you don't waste
your time nor Rasika's.

561
00:46:06,525 --> 00:46:08,773
Will this fit a six year old?

562
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:10,398
Yes.
- Pack it.

563
00:46:12,066 --> 00:46:13,148
By the way, Pawan...

564
00:46:13,316 --> 00:46:15,898
...if we don't find Munni's parents,
will she stay with us...

565
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,273
...even after we're married?

566
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,023
Why won't we find her parents?

567
00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:20,273
What if she doesn't have any?

568
00:46:20,441 --> 00:46:21,898
Who doesn't have parents?

569
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:23,773
Orphans!

570
00:46:25,941 --> 00:46:27,523
Who is your favorite player?

571
00:46:27,941 --> 00:46:28,983
Dhoni!

572
00:46:29,691 --> 00:46:31,108
Virat Kohli.

573
00:46:31,775 --> 00:46:32,773
Yuvi!

574
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:35,523
Shikhar Dhawan?

575
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:37,108
Sehwag?

576
00:46:38,316 --> 00:46:39,816
These are the only players.

577
00:46:39,816 --> 00:46:42,608
I bet you know nothing about cricket.

578
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:53,733
Munni is not an orphan.

579
00:46:54,275 --> 00:46:57,148
Otherwise Lord Bajrang Bali
would've given me some indication

580
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,483
Pawan.

581
00:47:00,525 --> 00:47:03,983
When did He tell you
that she has parents?

582
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:35,648
Munni!

583
00:47:36,316 --> 00:47:38,023
Munni!
- What happened to Munni?

584
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:39,191
Munni!

585
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:40,648
What happened to Munni?

586
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:41,648
Where is Munni.

587
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,023
Well... I can't find her anywhere.

588
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:46,148
What?

589
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,523
We were just eating together,
suddenly she disappeared.

590
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:53,523
Munni isn't
on the terrace either.

591
00:47:53,691 --> 00:47:54,648
Oh, God!

592
00:47:55,525 --> 00:47:57,483
Munni! Munni!

593
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:05,233
Munni!

594
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:06,398
Mun...

595
00:48:09,525 --> 00:48:12,398
Pawan!

596
00:48:58,275 --> 00:49:00,648
Chicken barra,
Chicken Muglai, chicken hariyali...

597
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:02,648
...chicken lollypop,
chicken kadai, chicken tawa...

598
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:05,523
...chicken tandoori, chicken masala,
chicken kohlapuri, chicken afghani...

599
00:49:05,691 --> 00:49:07,858
...chicken kashmiri, chicken
hyderabadi, chicken fried rice...

600
00:49:08,025 --> 00:49:10,566
...chicken noodles,
chicken Manchurian. Chicken 69...

601
00:49:10,566 --> 00:49:13,816
...chicken Kofta,
Chicken Korma, Chicken Chaudhary...

602
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:15,148
Mister...

603
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,148
Mister...
- Yes, sir.

604
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:19,273
Serve your best item to her.
- Okay.

605
00:49:23,566 --> 00:49:26,398
She's so fair,
I thought she must be a Brahmin.

606
00:49:31,066 --> 00:49:32,733
Must be a Kshatriya.

607
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:35,523
They eat meat and also
have a fair complexion.

608
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:38,273
Yes, she must be a Kshatriya.

609
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:39,898

Ayodhya.

656
00:54:25,316 --> 00:54:26,898
- Patparganj.
- Muradabad?

657
00:54:27,316 --> 00:54:28,441
Jhumri Talaiyya?

658
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:29,398
Asansol.

659
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,398
Come, dear.
Look, I've so many colorful bangles.

660
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,023
They're really nice.

661
00:54:32,275 --> 00:54:33,023
Come, dear.

662
00:54:33,025 --> 00:54:34,523
Take it.

663
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,023
My bangles.

664
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,983
Mister, please pay for the bangles.

665
00:54:41,441 --> 00:54:42,483
Please.

666
00:54:43,191 --> 00:54:44,148
Munni.

667
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,148
We don't want them.

668
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:49,523
Forgive her, she's just a kid.

669
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:52,148
- It's okay.
- Munni, it's wrong to steal.

670
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,398
Come, let's apologise to Bajrang Bali.

671
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:58,358
Lord... you know...

672
00:55:08,316 --> 00:55:13,483
Lord. You know... I went to
a non-veg restaurant yesterday.

673
00:55:13,775 --> 00:55:15,483
Because of Munni.

674
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:17,483
But I swear I didn't eat anything.

675
00:55:17,691 --> 00:55:19,148
Munni did.

676
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,273
Munni... concentrate.

677
00:55:22,566 --> 00:55:23,773
Munni did.

678
00:55:23,775 --> 00:55:24,858
Please forgive me.

679
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:29,023
You know... I feel helpless
in front of Munni.

680
00:55:29,316 --> 00:55:30,273
What to do?

681
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:33,983
Bajrang Bali.
You've already hinted...

682
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:36,316
...that Munni is a Kshatriya,
and not a Brahmin.

683
00:55:36,316 --> 00:55:37,233
Right...

684
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:42,648
Munni?

685
00:55:43,566 --> 00:55:45,483
Munni!

686
00:55:46,025 --> 00:55:47,523
Munni! Munni!

687
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,898
Munni!

688
00:55:55,441 --> 00:55:57,191
Bajrang Bali, please forgive Munni.

689
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:58,066
After all she's naïve.

690
00:55:58,066 --> 00:56:00,148
She doesn't know the difference
between temples and mosques.

691
00:56:06,066 --> 00:56:07,398
Come on, go in.

692
00:56:22,941 --> 00:56:44,898
Munni!

693
00:56:57,316 --> 00:56:58,398
Are you crazy?

694
00:57:04,191 --> 00:57:04,983
What happened?

695
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:07,648
Munni...

696
00:57:07,941 --> 00:57:08,898
Where's Munni?

697
00:57:10,025 --> 00:57:11,441
- What?
- She's that.

698
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:12,316
What?

699
00:57:12,316 --> 00:57:13,733
She's a Muslim.

700
00:57:13,941 --> 00:57:14,648
- Munni?
- Yes.

701
00:57:14,816 --> 00:57:17,023
Didn't you notice how she
was eating chicken last night?

702
00:57:17,191 --> 00:57:18,648
And now, she's in there...

703
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:21,648
...she covered her head with
the veil and was reading something.

704
00:57:21,816 --> 00:57:22,898
But where is she?

705
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,398
What will your father say?

706
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,566
Pawan, where is Munni.

707
00:57:25,566 --> 00:57:26,773
She cheated us.

708
00:57:26,775 --> 00:57:29,608
She cheated us?
She's just a 6 year old.

709
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,816
Away from her home,
separated from her parents.

710
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:33,148
The poor girl can't even speak.

711
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:34,273
What will your father say?

712
00:57:34,275 --> 00:57:35,523
She belongs to a different caste.

713
00:57:35,941 --> 00:57:37,648
Pawan, don't be silly.

714
00:57:38,066 --> 00:57:39,523
Do you know why I love you?

715
00:57:39,775 --> 00:57:41,566
Because you have a clean heart.

716
00:57:41,566 --> 00:57:44,023
Different caste... different people,
it's all nonsense.

717
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:46,483
Don't waste your time
in these stupid things.

718
00:57:47,066 --> 00:57:48,898
I can't explain to father.

719
00:57:49,191 --> 00:57:50,983
But I can at least tell you

720
00:57:51,566 --> 00:57:53,608
Come on. Munni is all alone inside.

721
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,648
Where is Munni?

722
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:25,773
Munni.

723
00:59:11,525 --> 00:59:14,523
<i>Pakistan needs 10 runs in 7 balls.</i>

724
00:59:16,316 --> 00:59:20,233
<i>He picked that up...
and the ball's in the air.</i>

725
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,648
Caught. He's caught it.

726
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:28,273
Come on, India. Munni clap...

727
00:59:28,441 --> 00:59:30,483
Amazing, boys. Really amazing.

728
00:59:31,691 --> 00:59:35,608
Father will throw Munni
and me out of the house.

729
00:59:35,816 --> 00:59:37,773
Only if he finds out.

730
00:59:38,816 --> 00:59:39,773
What do you mean?

731
00:59:39,941 --> 00:59:41,316
Who will tell him?

732
00:59:41,316 --> 00:59:42,648
I will.

733
00:59:43,691 --> 00:59:44,483
Are you crazy?

734
00:59:48,775 --> 00:59:51,898
Oh no...
Afridi's back on strike... my god!

735
00:59:52,066 --> 00:59:53,483
Oh no!

736
00:59:56,191 --> 00:59:57,523
Have you read the Mahabharat?

737
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:01,773
You must have seen it on television.

738
01:00:05,066 --> 01:00:07,398
What does Lord Krishna say to Arjun?

739
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,441
What?

740
01:00:08,441 --> 01:00:11,148
One must have an honest heart,
and that you do.

741
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,983
Your job is to get Munni home.

742
01:00:14,191 --> 01:00:16,273
After that you can tell
father anything you want.

743
01:00:17,566 --> 01:00:19,566
<i>Afridi is trying to stay on crease.</i>

744
01:00:19,566 --> 01:00:21,898
<i>The ball's in the air again,
will it cross the boundary?</i>

745
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,773
<i>There's a fielder positioning himself
under the ball, but it's across the boundary.</i>

746
01:00:25,066 --> 01:00:27,941
<i>Pakistan needs 3 runs to win.</i>

747
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:30,316
Munni, what are you doing?
It's the wrong team.

748
01:00:30,316 --> 01:00:31,691
Be quiet everyone.

749
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:33,358
This is a tense situation.

750
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:39,773
<i>The ball's across the boundary again.</i>

751
01:00:39,775 --> 01:00:41,523
<i>This is a magnificent
win for Pakistan.</i>

752
01:00:41,691 --> 01:00:44,273
<i>Oh... God! What has he done?</i>

753
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,066
Munni, what are you doing?

754
01:00:47,066 --> 01:00:48,773
That's the enemy's team.

755
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:50,648
What's wrong with her?

756
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:51,816
I wonder what's wrong with her.

757
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:53,191
She doesn't get it.

758
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,648
What is Munni doing?

759
01:01:02,066 --> 01:01:03,108
Munni.

760
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:05,983
Why is she dancing?

761
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,773
Munni, what's wrong with you?

762
01:01:16,441 --> 01:01:18,148
What is she doing?

763
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:23,898
Munni... Pakistan!

764
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,398
You brought her home
saying she's a Brahman.

765
01:01:35,816 --> 01:01:37,816
Are you the only kind-hearted
man on this planet?

766
01:01:37,816 --> 01:01:39,648
The only benefactor of
sad people around the world.

767
01:01:39,816 --> 01:01:42,066
There must have been other
people in Kurukshetra.

768
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:43,358
Why didn't they take her home?

769
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:44,648
Sir, I didn't do anything.

770
01:01:44,816 --> 01:01:46,148
She was following me.

771
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:49,148
Tomorrow morning you will
take her to Pakistan embassy

772
01:01:49,316 --> 01:01:49,816
Father..

773
01:01:49,816 --> 01:01:51,648
Look, the people of her country..

774
01:01:51,816 --> 01:01:54,691
...brutally kill
the people of my country

775
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:57,108
- But father, what's Munni's fault?
- I know.

776
01:01:57,275 --> 01:01:59,398
But she belongs to that country.

777
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,398
Look. I am not cruel.

778
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,398
But I can't tolerate
her in my house anymore.

779
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:10,358
Make arrangements to send her back.

780
01:02:10,691 --> 01:02:11,773
Immediately.

781
01:02:27,316 --> 01:02:30,898
<i>Pakistan, come to your senses!</i>

782
01:02:31,066 --> 01:02:34,733
<i>Release Karamjeet Singh.</i>

783
01:02:34,941 --> 01:02:38,398
<i>Pakistan, come to your senses!</i>

784
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:42,148
<i>Release Karamjeet Singh.</i>

785
01:02:42,316 --> 01:02:45,773
<i>Pakistan, come to your senses!</i>

786
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:49,148
<i>Release Karamjeet Singh.</i>

787
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,941
<i>Pakistan, come to your senses!</i>

788
01:02:52,941 --> 01:02:56,233
<i>Release Karamjeet Singh.</i>

789
01:02:56,441 --> 01:02:57,148
Next.

790
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:02,398
Please application passport.

791
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:03,816
I don't want to go to your country.

792
01:03:03,816 --> 01:03:05,191
I just came to drop her here.

793
01:03:05,191 --> 01:03:06,898
Send her back home. She's a Pakistani.

794
01:03:07,566 --> 01:03:09,523
Hello, dear. What's your name?

795
01:03:11,066 --> 01:03:12,608
She can't speak.

796
01:03:12,816 --> 01:03:15,398
- Where's her passport?
- I don't know where her passport is.

797
01:03:17,066 --> 01:03:18,566
Then how do you know she's Pakistani.

798
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:20,148
Yesterday when Pakistan
won the match..

799
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:21,648
...she started dancing
in front of everyone.

800
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:22,648
In front of Sir too...

801
01:03:22,816 --> 01:03:24,773
And she even kissed the
Pakistani flag on television.

802
01:03:24,775 --> 01:03:26,816
So that makes her Pakistani?

803
01:03:26,816 --> 01:03:28,066
How do you know her?

804
01:03:28,066 --> 01:03:29,733
I met her in Kurukshetra.

805
01:03:29,941 --> 01:03:32,148
- What was she doing there?
- How do I know?

806
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:34,566
Go away, we cannot do
anything without a passport.

807
01:03:34,566 --> 01:03:35,733
Why not?

808
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:37,148
I am saying she's a Pakistani.

809
01:03:37,316 --> 01:03:38,233
Send her home.

810
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:40,148
Have you lost your mind?

811
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,773
Don't you have any common sense?

812
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:43,108
Go away, there are
other people in the queue.

813
01:03:43,316 --> 01:03:44,773
I don't care, I will leave her here.

814
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:47,023
Look, this is my last warning,
if you don't leave..

815
01:03:47,025 --> 01:03:49,023
...I will call security
and throw you out.

816
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,273
And I'll call my people and..

817
01:03:50,275 --> 01:03:52,316
...throw you all out of the country.

818
01:03:52,316 --> 01:03:53,898
Throw me out?

819
01:03:54,066 --> 01:03:55,316
I am Indian myself. A Jaini! Go away.

820
01:03:55,316 --> 01:03:56,398
I work for the Pakistani Embassy.

821
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,273
Security. Security.

822
01:03:58,275 --> 01:03:59,316
Throw him out.

823
01:03:59,316 --> 01:04:01,148
<i>Pakistan, come to your senses!</i>

824
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:07,108
<i>Release Karamjeet Singh.</i>

825
01:04:07,316 --> 01:04:12,983
<i>Pakistan, come to your senses!</i>

826
01:04:14,566 --> 01:04:16,773
<i>Release Karamjeet Singh.</i>

827
01:04:54,441 --> 01:04:57,648
<i>Some people tried to scale
the walls of the High Commission.</i>

828
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,148
<i>Around 14 people were
injured in this scuffle.</i>

829
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,898
<i>Pakistani High Commissioner,
Abdul Bashir..</i>

830
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,773
<i>... has said in an official
statement, that..</i>

831
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:07,441
<i>... keeping the security of
the High Commission's staff in mind..</i>

832
01:05:07,441 --> 01:05:13,148
<i>... he's shutting down all counselor
and visa services for a month.</i>

833
01:05:13,566 --> 01:05:15,523
Wonderful, Bajrangi.

834
01:05:16,441 --> 01:05:19,148
I told you to send the girl back..

835
01:05:19,566 --> 01:05:21,273
And you shut-down the embassy instead.

836
01:05:21,441 --> 01:05:24,523
So Munni will live
with us for another month.

837
01:05:24,775 --> 01:05:26,773
There's no need for that.

838
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:30,023
Govind was saying that..

839
01:05:30,025 --> 01:05:32,773
...there's a travel agent close
to his office, on Purani Sadak.

840
01:05:33,316 --> 01:05:34,898
He'll make all the arrangements.

841
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,523
No, mister,
we don't make Pakistani passport.

842
01:05:38,691 --> 01:05:40,898
- Why not?
- Why?

843
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,273
Well... I have never made one.

844
01:05:42,441 --> 01:05:44,398
People come here
for American passports..

845
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,648
...Canada as well.

846
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,773
England, Germany... even Japan.

847
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:51,773
But if Munni's from Pakistan,
then why will she go to Germany?

848
01:05:55,191 --> 01:05:55,898
True.

849
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:59,523
But sorry,
we can't make Pakistani passport.

850
01:06:01,816 --> 01:06:02,733
Strange.

851
01:06:03,566 --> 01:06:04,523
Let's go, Munni.

852
01:06:08,441 --> 01:06:09,398
Mister...

853
01:06:12,816 --> 01:06:14,983
I have a 'without-passport' route.

854
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:15,983
Meaning?

855
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:18,273
I mean I know some people..

856
01:06:18,691 --> 01:06:19,773
Who can help cross the border...

857
01:06:20,025 --> 01:06:21,358
- Really?
- Yes.

858
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,773
I can request them.

859
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,358
Please do it.

860
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:31,608
I am in real trouble with this girl.

861
01:06:31,941 --> 01:06:34,233
Fine, I'll have a word with them.

862
01:06:34,441 --> 01:06:36,398
But... do you have 150,000?

863
01:06:37,816 --> 01:06:39,023
150,000?

864
01:06:40,441 --> 01:06:42,898
4-4-4-4...

865
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:47,148
5-5-5-5...

866
01:06:47,691 --> 01:06:49,273
25,000!

867
01:06:49,941 --> 01:06:53,148
26, 27...

868
01:06:59,275 --> 01:07:00,483
What's this, Rasika?

869
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,233
I withdrew it from the bank.

870
01:07:02,441 --> 01:07:04,441
What have you done, Rasika?
This money was..

871
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:05,358
I know.

872
01:07:05,566 --> 01:07:07,398
This money is for
the deposit of our house.

873
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:13,898
But right now... it's more important
to send Munni home.

874
01:07:14,566 --> 01:07:15,816
No, Rasika.

875
01:07:15,816 --> 01:07:18,648
If I don't buy a house, father
will get you married to someone else.

876
01:07:21,275 --> 01:07:22,858
My innocent Bajrangi.

877
01:07:24,566 --> 01:07:26,148
You still don't understand, do you?

878
01:07:26,566 --> 01:07:33,983
Even the Lord... can't separate
us in this lifetime.

879
01:07:37,441 --> 01:07:39,148
Swear on Bajrang Bali.

880
01:07:45,525 --> 01:07:48,398
How will those agents
find Munni's parents?

881
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,608
These agents have many connections.

882
01:07:54,691 --> 01:07:57,148
Look, mister. Don't worry.

883
01:07:57,316 --> 01:07:59,148
I'll call you once we're there.

884
01:08:00,275 --> 01:08:02,773
Here's my number.

885
01:08:03,691 --> 01:08:05,566
As soon as Munni is
united with her parents..

886
01:08:05,566 --> 01:08:08,148
...please call me.
- Of course.

887
01:08:08,691 --> 01:08:10,358
Well... we should leave now.

888
01:08:11,525 --> 01:08:12,233
Come on.

889
01:08:17,317 --> 01:08:18,648
Don't cry, Munni.

890
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:21,232
Uncle's taking you home to Pakistan.

891
01:08:21,942 --> 01:08:24,023
He's taking you to your mom.

892
01:08:24,942 --> 01:08:25,691
Come on, dear.

893
01:08:25,692 --> 01:08:27,816
Munni, this is not your country,
you cannot stay here.

894
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:29,523
And I can't go there.

895
01:08:29,525 --> 01:08:30,316
Come on, dear.

896
01:08:30,317 --> 01:08:32,898
Since I met you things
have been getting worse for me.

897
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:35,398
Finally you have an
opportunity to go home.

898
01:08:35,817 --> 01:08:37,441
Now let go of me.

899
01:08:37,442 --> 01:08:39,857
I beg you. Let me go.

900
01:08:40,275 --> 01:08:43,148
Go back to your home.
I beg you!

922

- Mister, where is that kid.
- Which kid?

923
01:10:58,442 --> 01:11:01,357
- The same one who was on your rickshaw
- There.

924
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:20,982
Hey, boy.

925
01:11:21,692 --> 01:11:22,773
Hail Sri Ram.

926
01:11:22,775 --> 01:11:23,816
Did you see a small girl here?

927
01:11:23,817 --> 01:11:25,441
Her name is Munni.
She just arrived here.

928
01:11:25,442 --> 01:11:26,648
Come here.

929
01:11:27,692 --> 01:11:29,523
- I'll be your Munni..
- Let go, sister.

930
01:11:29,692 --> 01:11:30,898
Sister?

931
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,773
Do I look like your sister?

932
01:11:32,775 --> 01:11:33,982
Munni!

933
01:11:35,317 --> 01:11:36,023
Are you crazy?

934
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:37,898
- Munni! - Why the hell you
going on screaming for Munni?

935
01:11:38,067 --> 01:11:39,398
Munni!

936
01:11:39,567 --> 01:11:41,773
Not yet, close the door.

937
01:11:42,192 --> 01:11:43,107
Munni!

938
01:11:45,692 --> 01:11:48,023
- Where are you going?
- Stop him.

939
01:11:50,025 --> 01:11:51,398
What are you doing?

940
01:11:53,067 --> 01:11:53,773
Munni!

941
01:11:55,692 --> 01:11:56,732
Who is he?

942
01:12:55,442 --> 01:12:56,648
Get the girl back.

943
01:14:09,525 --> 01:14:12,273
Let's sit down and talk, please.

944
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:29,898
Now?

945
01:15:30,942 --> 01:15:34,148
Now I'll take Munni home myself.

946
01:15:35,817 --> 01:15:37,607
Don't be crazy, Pawan.

947
01:15:38,025 --> 01:15:39,148
You don't have a passport or a visa.

948
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,441
Nor do you know anyone there.

949
01:15:41,442 --> 01:15:42,691
We'll find a way.

950
01:15:42,692 --> 01:15:45,648
'All comforts of the
world lie at your feet.'

951
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:49,023
'Devotees Feel fearless
under your benign Protection.'

952
01:15:50,025 --> 01:15:52,523
'One is freed from all
the sufferings and ill fates'

953
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:55,773
'He who adores and
remembers Shri Hanuman.'

954
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:03,982
I don't have a passport
or visa... nor any connections.

955
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:08,357
But just like Bajrang Bali.
Lord Ram resides in my heart too.

956
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:13,857
And nothing is impossible
for such a person, Rasika.

957
01:16:16,442 --> 01:16:17,523
Hail Sri Ram!

958
01:17:47,317 --> 01:17:48,648
Stop right there...

959
01:17:49,775 --> 01:17:53,273
Who are you?

960
01:17:53,775 --> 01:17:54,898
This is my area.

961
01:17:55,067 --> 01:17:57,023
So when did I say this is my area?

962
01:17:57,775 --> 01:18:00,648
Are you trying to cross the border?

963
01:18:01,442 --> 01:18:03,273
Let's see how you cross the border...

964
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:05,898
It'll cost you 25,000... cash.

965
01:18:06,192 --> 01:18:07,441
If you have the cash,
then come along.

966
01:18:07,442 --> 01:18:10,773
- Otherwise get lost.
- Come on, Munni.

967
01:18:11,317 --> 01:18:14,898
The border's got electric
fences all around.

968
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:17,023
440 volts.

969
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:20,982
It reduces anyone to ashes.

970
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,732
Listen... Look here.

971
01:18:24,525 --> 01:18:26,232
Mohammad Ali Jinnah!

972
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:28,273
Have you ever seen him?

973
01:18:28,442 --> 01:18:30,398
This is Pakistani currency.

974
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,898
Gandhi isn't going to work there.

975
01:18:33,192 --> 01:18:35,357
- Come, Munni.
- Listen.

976
01:18:35,692 --> 01:18:37,398
Don't you get it?

977
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:42,023
If you go this way,
the BSF will spot you.

978
01:18:42,525 --> 01:18:43,773
Listen here...

979
01:18:44,192 --> 01:18:47,773
They will shoot you first
and then ask your ghost

980
01:18:47,942 --> 01:18:49,441
...whether you're from here or there?

981
01:18:49,442 --> 01:18:53,273
Listen... it's not easy
to cross the border.

982
01:18:53,275 --> 01:18:55,441
I have... connections.

983
01:18:55,442 --> 01:18:57,523
On both sides.

984
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:00,023
Come on, get in the car.

985
01:19:00,192 --> 01:19:01,941
It's for the best interest of the kid.

986
01:19:01,942 --> 01:19:03,398
It'll only cost you 50,000.

987
01:19:03,567 --> 01:19:05,023
But you just said 25,000.

988
01:19:05,192 --> 01:19:07,482
25,000 for one person.

989
01:19:07,817 --> 01:19:10,773
Why will Munni pay, she's going home?

990
01:19:10,942 --> 01:19:12,023
Going home?

991
01:19:13,317 --> 01:19:17,523
That is when I decided that I myself
will take Munni back to Pakistan.

992
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:18,566
Wow!

993
01:19:18,567 --> 01:19:22,523
I knew the moment I saw you
that you re a very righteous man.

994
01:19:37,692 --> 01:19:41,316
Listen... on the other
side of the fence..

995
01:19:41,317 --> 01:19:43,941
...the Pakistani army takes
rounds in every 10 minutes.

996
01:19:43,942 --> 01:19:46,648
There are four tunnels
under the fences.

997
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:49,648
We'll have to crawl through
the tunnel within 10 minutes..

998
01:19:49,817 --> 01:19:51,066
...and get to the other side.

999
01:19:51,067 --> 01:19:54,773
You see those sand dunes
we need to get behind them.

1000
01:19:55,442 --> 01:19:58,773
And then... Welcome to Pakistan!

1001
01:20:27,317 --> 01:20:28,107
Come!

1002
01:20:28,442 --> 01:20:30,148
I will go only after
taking permission.

1003
01:20:30,775 --> 01:20:32,648
What? What will you take?

1004
01:20:32,817 --> 01:20:34,648
I'll take permission
from the Pakistani Army..

1005
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:35,691
...and then go into Pakistan.

1006
01:20:35,692 --> 01:20:38,398
This isn't the place to crack jokes.

1007
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,023
Let's go. Come on.

1008
01:20:39,192 --> 01:20:40,648
I am a devotee of Bajrang Bali.

1009
01:20:40,817 --> 01:20:42,023
Never do anything on the sly.

1010
01:20:42,192 --> 01:20:43,691
Are you crazy?

1011
01:20:43,692 --> 01:20:45,148
They will shoot all of us.

1012
01:20:45,442 --> 01:20:47,357
Come on, let's go.

1013
01:20:49,275 --> 01:20:51,273
Munni.
Munni, we'll first take permission.

1014
01:20:51,442 --> 01:20:53,023
We'll take permission..

1015
01:20:53,025 --> 01:20:55,857
I knew the moment I saw you...
that you're crazy.

1016
01:20:56,067 --> 01:20:57,441
Munni, you tell him.

1017
01:20:57,442 --> 01:21:00,148
You fool.
The camels are coming this way.

1018
01:21:00,317 --> 01:21:02,107
Come on. Run.

1019
01:21:02,317 --> 01:21:04,023
Come on, or you will die.

1020
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,566
You won't live through this.

1021
01:21:05,567 --> 01:21:07,898
Munni, we'll take permission first.

1022
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:19,982
Who are you?

1023
01:21:21,317 --> 01:21:24,107
Hail Sri Ram.

1024
01:21:33,525 --> 01:21:34,732
Are you Indian?

1025
01:21:35,692 --> 01:21:38,273
Yes. But Munni is Pakistani.

1026
01:21:38,275 --> 01:21:40,648
She got separated from her parents.

1027
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:42,982
I am taking her to Pakistan
to reunite them.

1028
01:21:43,817 --> 01:21:46,857
Sir, this is a story
we've never heard before!

1029
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:53,523
Then why didn't you just leave?

1030
01:21:53,525 --> 01:21:55,023
I am a devotee of Bajrang Bali.

1031
01:21:55,442 --> 01:21:57,398
Never do anything on the sly.

1032
01:21:57,692 --> 01:21:59,816
I was waiting here
for your permission.

1033
01:21:59,817 --> 01:22:01,523
This is the Pakistan border

1034
01:22:01,525 --> 01:22:03,191
If at all you wanted permission...

1035
01:22:03,192 --> 01:22:04,523
then why didn't you
go to the Pakistan embassy?

1036
01:22:04,775 --> 01:22:07,316
I did go to the Pakistan embassy,
the one in Delhi.

1037
01:22:07,317 --> 01:22:08,732
Isn't it, Munni? Didn't we?

1038
01:22:12,067 --> 01:22:13,941
But they threw us out.

1039
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:14,982
So how did you get here?

1040
01:22:15,192 --> 01:22:17,523
- Boo Ali brought us here.
- Boo Ali.

1041
01:22:17,525 --> 01:22:18,691
Boo Ali is an agent.

1042
01:22:18,692 --> 01:22:20,898
He was saying that he has
connections on both sides.

1043
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,148
What nonsense.

1044
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:23,773
How did you get on
this side of the fence?

1045
01:22:23,942 --> 01:22:26,398
Through the tunnel.
We crawled all the way.

1046
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,816
It's a straight tunnel.

1047
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:29,482
Tunnel? Where?

1048
01:22:30,442 --> 01:22:31,773
He is standing on it.

1049
01:22:32,567 --> 01:22:35,023
- Take a look.
- Sir.

1050
01:22:36,317 --> 01:22:37,023
Look

1051
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,648
Sir, he's definitely a spy.

1052
01:22:43,317 --> 01:22:45,107
Shall we arrest him?

1053
01:22:46,275 --> 01:22:47,107
No.

1054
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:54,148
Throw them back into the same tunnel

1055
01:22:54,442 --> 01:22:56,023
And fill the tunnel with sand.

1056
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:03,023
Run away or else we will shoot!

1057
01:23:03,192 --> 01:23:04,398
Go on.

1058
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:27,232
Hail Sri Ram!

1059
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:31,482
What..

1060
01:23:40,317 --> 01:23:41,232
Beat him.

1061
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:54,273
Munni... don't worry.

1062
01:23:54,442 --> 01:23:56,648
It's nothing.
Doesn't hurt at all.

1063
01:23:56,650 --> 01:23:57,648
Doesn't hurt..

1064
01:23:59,192 --> 01:24:00,523
It does hurt.

1065
01:24:00,525 --> 01:24:04,898
All this is scaring her. That's why...

1066
01:24:06,317 --> 01:24:09,273
Leave him!

1067
01:24:13,775 --> 01:24:15,398
How did you come back?

1068
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,857
There's another tunnel over there.

1069
01:24:19,442 --> 01:24:22,398
- Who told you about this tunnel?
- Boo Ali.

1070
01:24:22,567 --> 01:24:23,732
Boo Ali.

1071
01:24:24,775 --> 01:24:27,816
Sir, I've promised Bajrang Bali..

1072
01:24:27,817 --> 01:24:32,398
...I won't rest until I
reunite Munni with her parents.

1073
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:36,773
- I will teach you..
- Rafiq! Stay back!

1074
01:24:39,192 --> 01:24:43,191
Look, I wouldn't have
allowed you through here..

1075
01:24:43,192 --> 01:24:45,857
...even if you had
a passport and a visa.

1076
01:24:49,025 --> 01:24:51,523
Go back right now.

1077
01:24:52,692 --> 01:24:54,691
It's for your best interest.

1078
01:24:54,692 --> 01:24:57,648
Sir, I promise I
will return to India..

1079
01:24:58,317 --> 01:25:02,107
...as soon as I find Munni's parents.

1080
01:25:08,317 --> 01:25:11,773
Look, exactly 10 minutes later..

1081
01:25:12,567 --> 01:25:13,898
...we'll come back
here doing our rounds.

1082
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,523
Within those 10 minutes.
Whether you go this way..

1083
01:25:17,692 --> 01:25:20,398
...or back there, we don't know.

1084
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:22,148
- But, sir..
- But.

1085
01:25:22,942 --> 01:25:27,357
But if I see you again,
I will definitely shoot you.

1086
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,232
Come on.

1087
01:25:33,317 --> 01:25:36,023
- And find out who the hell is Boo Ali?
- Yes, sir.

1088
01:26:05,942 --> 01:26:07,023
Hail Sri Ram.

1089
01:26:07,025 --> 01:26:09,523
Sir, he's definitely crazy.

1090
01:26:12,942 --> 01:26:15,816
You don't care about your life,
but think about this girl.

1091
01:26:15,817 --> 01:26:20,773
Sir, I could've disappeared
into the night before you returned.

1092
01:26:21,025 --> 01:26:22,691
But I am a devotee
of Bajrang Bali, and..

1093
01:26:22,692 --> 01:26:24,148
Yeah, we know.

1094
01:26:24,317 --> 01:26:26,316
You don't do anything on the sly.

1095
01:26:26,317 --> 01:26:27,691
And you've made a promise.

1096
01:26:27,692 --> 01:26:29,607
Don't you have anything else to say?

1097
01:26:30,067 --> 01:26:33,898
I promise you,
I will return to India..

1098
01:26:34,067 --> 01:26:35,898
...as soon as I take
Munni to her parents.

1099
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:38,523
Just give me permission.

1100
01:26:39,025 --> 01:26:41,273
I told you to go, so why didn't you?

1101
01:26:41,692 --> 01:26:46,066
That wasn't any permission, sir.
It would've still been on the sly

1102
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:47,732
Sir, he's completely crazy.

1103
01:26:56,067 --> 01:26:58,148
Fine. Go.

1104
01:26:59,692 --> 01:27:00,523
Sir?

1105
01:27:00,692 --> 01:27:02,148
Sir? Sir?

1106
01:27:05,067 --> 01:27:07,732
- Can I go, sir?
- Yes. Go.

1107
01:27:10,442 --> 01:27:11,648
Munni. Let's go.

1108
01:27:16,692 --> 01:27:21,023
If you truly are Bajrang
Bali's devotee, then do come back.

1109
01:27:21,567 --> 01:27:23,107
It's a promise, sir.

1110
01:27:28,692 --> 01:27:31,523
Hail Sri Ram!

1111
01:27:40,567 --> 01:27:41,732
You're right.

1112
01:27:42,775 --> 01:27:44,523
He's definitely crazy.

1122
01:28:55,775 --> 01:28:56,773
Mister.

1123
01:28:58,692 --> 01:28:59,898
Yes, brother.

1124
01:29:00,692 --> 01:29:02,648
- Can I get something vegetarian?
- What?

1125
01:29:02,817 --> 01:29:04,648
Vegetables.

1126
01:29:05,442 --> 01:29:06,273
Veggies.

1127
01:29:06,442 --> 01:29:07,816
There are vegetables in this.

1128
01:29:07,817 --> 01:29:10,441
There's beetroot, capsicum, peas.

1129
01:29:10,442 --> 01:29:12,398
Spinach too.
Full of vegetables.

1130
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,398
No... only vegetables.

1131
01:29:14,567 --> 01:29:17,023
What's wrong? Is the kid unwell?

1132
01:29:17,567 --> 01:29:18,898
What's wrong, Dear?

1133
01:29:19,317 --> 01:29:21,816
No, she's absolutely fine.
Then, are you unwell?

1134
01:29:21,817 --> 01:29:22,898
No.

1135
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,523
Then why do you want only
eat vegetables?

1136
01:29:28,692 --> 01:29:31,773
Well. Keep that one
and take this one away.

1137
01:29:33,942 --> 01:29:35,482
And get me some tea and bread.

1138
01:29:39,192 --> 01:29:40,273
Bilal.

1139
01:29:40,442 --> 01:29:44,648
If you serve me cold bread
again like yesterday. I'll whack you.

1140
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,148
Understand.

1141
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:49,398
Eat quickly,
Munni and let's get out of here.

1142
01:30:01,067 --> 01:30:02,398
Did you eat your fill, Munni?

1143
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:05,566
Now we'll find your
parents very quickly!

1144
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:06,648
Stop!

1145
01:30:10,192 --> 01:30:11,023
Wait.

1146
01:30:11,942 --> 01:30:14,648
- Munni, why is that cop
coming this way? - Wait.

1147
01:30:16,692 --> 01:30:20,398
- Where are the handcuffs?
- What handcuffs?

1148
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:22,482
The one you stole from my belt buckle.

1149
01:30:22,692 --> 01:30:24,191
Who steals handcuffs?

1150
01:30:24,192 --> 01:30:26,107
Search his bag. Check it.

1151
01:30:26,317 --> 01:30:29,773
Wait. Wait. Look... Look... take a look.

1152
01:30:29,942 --> 01:30:31,148
Are there any handcuffs?

1153
01:30:32,442 --> 01:30:33,566
There are no handcuffs in it.

1154
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:34,898
Not there?
And hers?

1155
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:37,398
What will a small
girl do with handcuffs?

1156
01:30:38,775 --> 01:30:40,148
Show them, Munni.

1157
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:41,148
Give it, dear.

1158
01:30:41,317 --> 01:30:42,898
Here... take a look.

1159
01:30:43,192 --> 01:30:47,523
Check it.

1160
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:00,273
What's your name?

1161
01:31:00,817 --> 01:31:03,398
- Pawan.
- Pawan what?

1162
01:31:03,567 --> 01:31:05,148
Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi.

1163
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:08,482
- People call me Bajrangi.
- We won't.

1164
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:09,982
Are you Indian?

1165
01:31:10,817 --> 01:31:11,773
Yes.

1166
01:31:11,942 --> 01:31:13,398
Show me your passport.

1167
01:31:14,817 --> 01:31:16,398
I don't have a passport.

1168
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,273
You don't have a passport.
Then how did you get into Pakistan?

1169
01:31:19,442 --> 01:31:21,773
- I crawled under the fence.
- Under the fence?

1170
01:31:21,775 --> 01:31:23,273
Yes, but I took permission.

1171
01:31:25,275 --> 01:31:27,441
I don't like lies.

1172
01:31:27,442 --> 01:31:29,023
I don't lie.
I am a devotee of Bajrangi Bali.

1173
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,857
You entered our country in
the dead of the night like thieves.

1174
01:31:32,025 --> 01:31:33,773
Do you know who does that?

1175
01:31:34,067 --> 01:31:35,148
Rats or spies.

1176
01:31:35,317 --> 01:31:36,441
I am not a spy.

1177
01:31:36,442 --> 01:31:38,482
And Munni is Pakistani.

1178
01:31:38,817 --> 01:31:40,023
She's Pakistani.

1179
01:31:40,025 --> 01:31:42,773
I see... she's Pakistani.

1180
01:31:48,567 --> 01:31:51,523
I see... she's Pakistani!

1181
01:31:52,317 --> 01:31:55,523
Yeah... and I am Sachin Tendulkar.

1182
01:31:55,942 --> 01:31:56,898
Arrest him.

1183
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,691
Bring him along.

1184
01:31:58,692 --> 01:32:01,023
Come on.

1185
01:32:02,192 --> 01:32:06,273
People are coming from
Karachi to celebrate Eid.

1186
01:32:06,275 --> 01:32:07,148
He's back again.

1187
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:09,273
Please... we'll miss the train.

1188
01:32:09,442 --> 01:32:10,773
People are coming Karachi..

1189
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:12,566
What are you doing?
Stop them.

1190
01:32:12,567 --> 01:32:14,316
Please... we'll miss the train.

1191
01:32:14,317 --> 01:32:16,523
People are coming
from Karachi to celebrate Eid.

1192
01:32:16,692 --> 01:32:18,148
What an ungrateful man..

1193
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:19,398
Go that way.

1194
01:32:20,067 --> 01:32:23,816
People are coming from
Karachi to celebrate Eid.

1195
01:32:23,817 --> 01:32:24,648
What are you doing, madam?

1196
01:32:24,817 --> 01:32:26,648
Please go that way,
we'll miss the train.

1197
01:32:27,025 --> 01:32:29,357
People are arriving in Karachi..

1198
01:32:29,525 --> 01:32:32,441
People are arriving
in Karachi to celebrate Eid.

1199
01:32:32,442 --> 01:32:33,691
What are you doing? Stop them.

1200
01:32:33,692 --> 01:32:35,273
Please go that way,
we'll miss the train.

1201
01:32:35,525 --> 01:32:38,982
People are coming from
Karachi to celebrate Eid.

1202
01:32:39,192 --> 01:32:41,023
This is Chand Nawab from Chawra
along with cameraman Kamil Yusuf.

1203
01:32:41,192 --> 01:32:42,648
What a rascal..

1204
01:32:42,817 --> 01:32:44,482
Why are you standing on the
middle of the road?

1205
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:45,773
What nonsense.

1206
01:32:46,192 --> 01:32:48,523
You're blabbering here like a fool.

1207
01:32:48,692 --> 01:32:50,816
The police just caught an Indian spy.

1208
01:32:50,817 --> 01:32:52,773
Indian spy? Where?

1209
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:53,648
At Bilal's eatery.

1210
01:32:53,817 --> 01:32:55,148
They are taking him
to the police station.

1211
01:32:55,317 --> 01:32:57,107
Come on.
This is breaking news.

1212
01:32:57,942 --> 01:32:59,648
- Did Pawan call?
- No.

1213
01:33:00,567 --> 01:33:01,566
But he will soon.

1214
01:33:01,567 --> 01:33:04,898
He must have helped
Munni board the train by now.

1215
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:07,898
Didn't you tell him to
call as soon as he got to Wagah?

1216
01:33:08,067 --> 01:33:10,773
I did, maybe he forgot.

1217
01:33:10,942 --> 01:33:13,273
Then you could've called him instead.

1218
01:33:22,275 --> 01:33:23,398
Hamid Sir...

1219
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,691
We've reached the police station,
please come quickly.

1220
01:33:25,692 --> 01:33:27,357
Greetings.

1221
01:33:28,067 --> 01:33:29,773
Yeah, greetings.

1222
01:33:31,067 --> 01:33:34,523
- Tell us about your mission.
- Mission?

1223
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:36,816
Yes, I did take permission.

1224
01:33:36,817 --> 01:33:37,816
No, tell me in detail.

1225
01:33:37,817 --> 01:33:38,648
Start from the beginning.

1226
01:33:38,817 --> 01:33:41,023
How did you get into Pakistan?

1227
01:33:41,942 --> 01:33:43,398
I crawled under the fence?

1228
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:46,357
How much are they paying
you for this dangerous mission?

1229
01:33:46,692 --> 01:33:49,148
Pay? Why will I get paid?

1230
01:33:50,067 --> 01:33:51,148
I am doing this willingly.

1231
01:33:51,317 --> 01:33:53,523
- I see... so you're a patriot.
- What?

1232
01:33:53,942 --> 01:33:55,273
What do they call it?

1233
01:33:55,442 --> 01:33:56,816
Patriot!

1234
01:33:56,817 --> 01:33:59,148
- You're a patriot.
- Without a doubt. What? Patriot. Patriot

1235
01:33:59,317 --> 01:34:01,523
What's the role of the kid?

1236
01:34:01,525 --> 01:34:02,523
Get the kid in frame.

1237
01:34:03,025 --> 01:34:04,066
Munni's the main reason.

1238
01:34:04,067 --> 01:34:06,898
That's enough, get lost.

1239
01:34:07,817 --> 01:34:09,107
Get in front.

1240
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:12,148
Hurry up.

1241
01:34:12,442 --> 01:34:15,732
As you saw in our exclusive footage..

1242
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:20,273
...An Indian spy was arrested
along with his 6 year old companion..

1243
01:34:20,442 --> 01:34:22,732
...from Chawra district.

1244
01:34:22,942 --> 01:34:25,941
The child's been trained so well..

1245
01:34:25,942 --> 01:34:27,691
...that she didn't even speak a word.

1246
01:34:27,692 --> 01:34:30,898
This is Chand Nawab, along
with cameraman Kamil Yusuf, Chawra.

1247
01:34:31,817 --> 01:34:33,898
- Shall we do it once more?
- Got it.

1248
01:34:34,067 --> 01:34:35,523
Flabby police man.

1249
01:34:36,317 --> 01:34:37,398
Stop recording.

1250
01:34:39,067 --> 01:34:40,107
Sir.

1251
01:34:43,567 --> 01:34:45,607
It's an Indian number.

1252
01:34:49,692 --> 01:34:50,648
What happened?

1253
01:34:50,817 --> 01:34:52,148
His phone's switched off.

1254
01:34:52,317 --> 01:34:54,982
Sir. I just got an
explosive interview.

1255
01:34:55,192 --> 01:34:56,898
Of an Indian spy.

1256
01:34:57,067 --> 01:35:00,773
I swear... this will make
your channel No.1 in Pakistan.

1257
01:35:02,525 --> 01:35:03,648
It's Chand Nawab.

1258
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:06,607
Says he has interviewed
some Indian spy.

1259
01:35:07,067 --> 01:35:09,107
What nonsense.
Tell him I am not here.

1260
01:35:09,942 --> 01:35:15,023
- Shamsher sir isn't here.
- Oh no. That's a problem.

1261
01:35:16,025 --> 01:35:19,648
Anyway, ask him to call
me as soon as he gets back.

1262
01:35:19,817 --> 01:35:22,148
Until then I'll prepare a report.

1263
01:35:22,567 --> 01:35:24,357
Hello. Hello.

1264
01:35:25,442 --> 01:35:26,316
Hello.

1265
01:35:26,317 --> 01:35:28,023
What's your motive
behind coming to Pakistan?

1266
01:35:28,192 --> 01:35:29,691
How many times do I tell you?

1267
01:35:29,692 --> 01:35:32,148
I came here to unite
Munni with her parents.

1268
01:35:32,525 --> 01:35:34,898
Keep lying and you'll
never see daylight again.

1269
01:35:35,067 --> 01:35:36,648
I don't lie.

1270
01:35:36,942 --> 01:35:38,566
Where are you going?

1271
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:40,023
What happened, Munni?

1272
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:41,482
Do you know that place?

1273
01:35:42,942 --> 01:35:44,523
Is that where your home is?

1274
01:35:47,067 --> 01:35:47,982
Munni...

1275
01:35:48,775 --> 01:35:50,148
This is Munni's home.

1276
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:52,316
- What's going on here?
- We found it, sir.

1277
01:35:52,317 --> 01:35:54,773
- We found Munni's home.
- What's this charade?

1278
01:35:54,775 --> 01:35:55,648
What's your name?

1279
01:35:55,817 --> 01:35:57,148
She's can't speak.

1280
01:35:57,150 --> 01:35:58,273
Can't speak?

1281
01:35:58,567 --> 01:36:00,691
Why? Has the cat got her tongue?

1282
01:36:00,692 --> 01:36:02,023
Let me see.

1283
01:36:02,692 --> 01:36:04,732
Show me.

1284
01:36:05,442 --> 01:36:09,648
Open your mouth.

1285
01:36:31,442 --> 01:36:33,066
According to our sources..

1286
01:36:33,067 --> 01:36:36,148
...the Indian spy is being
kept under tight security.

1287
01:36:36,317 --> 01:36:40,023
It's being said that he'll
be shifted directly to Islamabad.

1288
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:41,316
Where are you shifting to?

1289
01:36:41,317 --> 01:36:42,148
Look.

1290
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,482
Come quickly.

1291
01:36:44,442 --> 01:36:46,648
Come on. Get on.

1292
01:36:47,817 --> 01:36:49,607
I have the camera,
how are you going to shoot?

1293
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,773
There... in the bus.

1294
01:37:00,942 --> 01:37:01,773
Come on.

1295
01:37:01,942 --> 01:37:03,023
Pedal harder!

1296
01:37:04,442 --> 01:37:05,648
You can't do it.

1297
01:37:06,317 --> 01:37:08,023
I am going to spy on this spy.

1298
01:37:08,525 --> 01:37:10,523
Let's take this, it is faster.

1299
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:12,148
Where are you going?

1300
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:13,398
Let's go on this.

1301
01:37:15,275 --> 01:37:15,816
Ticket.

1302
01:37:15,817 --> 01:37:18,023
Thank god we got away Munni.

1303
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:22,523
Hello.

1304
01:37:22,692 --> 01:37:24,648
Sir, this is Chand Navab,
from district Chawra.

1305
01:37:25,567 --> 01:37:28,566
- That Indian spy is in the bus.
- Which bus?

1306
01:37:28,567 --> 01:37:29,566
The same bus I am in.

1307
01:37:29,567 --> 01:37:31,523
He's right in front of me,
come quickly.

1308
01:37:31,692 --> 01:37:33,398
You fool, which bus is it?

1309
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,982
It's en-route to Alipur,
it's called Chhammo Diwani.

1310
01:37:37,275 --> 01:37:38,232
Ticket.

1311
01:37:40,025 --> 01:37:41,523
Do you recognize this place?

1312
01:37:41,692 --> 01:37:43,273
Don't joke, mister.

1313
01:37:43,525 --> 01:37:45,441
Just tell me where you want to go.

1314
01:37:45,442 --> 01:37:47,023
This child is from Pakistan.

1315
01:37:47,192 --> 01:37:50,148
I don't know how
she got to India. Alone.

1316
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:52,441
I think she got separated
from her parents.

1317
01:37:52,442 --> 01:37:55,191
She can't speak,
but she recognizes this place.

1318
01:37:55,192 --> 01:37:57,773
I am sure she belongs
from somewhere here.

1319
01:37:57,942 --> 01:37:59,523
You're from India?

1320
01:38:05,942 --> 01:38:06,898
Yes!

1321
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,023
How?

1322
01:38:15,067 --> 01:38:19,191
I crawled under the
fence of the border.

1323
01:38:19,192 --> 01:38:20,607
But with permission.

1324
01:38:20,817 --> 01:38:24,023
You came all the way to Pakistan..

1325
01:38:24,442 --> 01:38:27,148
...to find the parents of this child?
- Yes.

1326
01:38:27,317 --> 01:38:28,316
Why?

1327
01:38:28,317 --> 01:38:29,691
Surprising, brother.

1328
01:38:29,692 --> 01:38:33,398
I wish there were more people
like you in both our countries.

1329
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,607
Show me the picture.

1330
01:38:36,275 --> 01:38:38,648
- Sir...
- Speak properly.

1331
01:38:38,650 --> 01:38:40,066
Stop stammering..

1332
01:38:40,067 --> 01:38:41,773
- He escaped, sir.
- What?

1333
01:38:43,942 --> 01:38:45,648
Does anyone recognize this place?

1334
01:38:45,942 --> 01:38:47,357
Take a good look.

1335
01:38:47,942 --> 01:38:49,023
Brother?

1336
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,648
No.

1337
01:39:04,942 --> 01:39:06,273
There? Must be that one.

1338
01:39:06,442 --> 01:39:07,107
Quickly.

1339
01:39:08,317 --> 01:39:09,066
That one.

1340
01:39:09,067 --> 01:39:11,482
That way. Come on.

1341
01:39:27,317 --> 01:39:28,148
What's wrong, sir?

1342
01:39:28,317 --> 01:39:32,066
Did a man in a brown sweater
get on this bus, along with a kid?

1343
01:39:32,067 --> 01:39:34,816
No, sir. No such man got on this bus?

1344
01:39:34,817 --> 01:39:38,566
Has anyone seen a man
along with a small kid?

1345
01:39:38,567 --> 01:39:40,191
No, sir. We haven't.

1346
01:39:40,192 --> 01:39:41,441
No.

1347
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:43,982
Chand Nawab said it was this bus.

1348
01:39:44,192 --> 01:39:45,398
Get down.

1349
01:39:47,317 --> 01:39:51,148
Sir, that girl was pointing
towards a picture of the mountains.

1350
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:52,648
Maybe that's her home.

1351
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:53,648
Where's the photo?

1352
01:39:54,317 --> 01:39:55,898
They took the photo.

1353
01:39:57,192 --> 01:39:58,816
Check all the buses on the highway.

1354
01:39:58,817 --> 01:40:00,232
- Come on.
- Yes.

1355
01:40:28,942 --> 01:40:33,773
Either you're very
brave... or a big fool.

1356
01:40:34,817 --> 01:40:37,232
You just entered Pakistan,
without any fear...

1357
01:40:38,025 --> 01:40:40,898
This was the only way
to bring Munni to Pakistan.

1358
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:42,023
Yes, that's okay.

1359
01:40:42,192 --> 01:40:45,023
But how will you find her parents?

1360
01:40:46,067 --> 01:40:47,482
Bajrang Bali will help me.

1361
01:40:47,692 --> 01:40:48,898
Even in Pakistan?

1362
01:40:59,692 --> 01:41:02,023
You'll be safe here tonight.

1363
01:41:02,317 --> 01:41:05,023
But brother, be sure to leave by dawn.

1364
01:41:06,067 --> 01:41:07,148
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1365
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,773
- What place is this?
- Mosque.

1366
01:41:30,650 --> 01:41:32,273
Forgive me, Bajrang Bali.
Forgive me.

1367
01:41:48,817 --> 01:41:50,273
Greetings.

1368
01:41:51,317 --> 01:41:52,941
What's wrong, Young man?

1369
01:41:52,942 --> 01:41:55,773
Are you sick? You look restless.

1370
01:41:56,025 --> 01:41:57,148
What's wrong with me?

1371
01:41:58,692 --> 01:42:01,148
I am absolutely fine.
Then why are you standing out here.

1372
01:42:01,150 --> 01:42:02,066
Let's go in.

1373
01:42:02,067 --> 01:42:03,523
Hey... listen.

1374
01:42:03,775 --> 01:42:05,816
Why didn't you come yesterday?

1375
01:42:05,817 --> 01:42:07,148
Go on.

1376
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:08,523
Sit in the class, I am coming.

1377
01:42:08,692 --> 01:42:11,023
- I can't go in.
- Why?

1378
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:12,898
I am not a Muslim.

1379
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,023
So what, Brother?

1380
01:42:18,192 --> 01:42:20,398
This place is open to everyone.

1381
01:42:20,567 --> 01:42:23,232
That's why we never lock the mosque.

1382
01:42:23,942 --> 01:42:25,023
Come on.

1383
01:42:29,817 --> 01:42:32,148
Come on, children. To your places.

1384
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,273
So that's the case.

1385
01:42:54,150 --> 01:42:56,773
I've never been to
the mountainous regions.

1386
01:42:57,025 --> 01:43:01,232
But there are some children
in my class, who belong from there.

1387
01:43:01,442 --> 01:43:03,107
Let me ask.

1388
01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:05,482
Children.

1389
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:10,482
Yes, teacher

1390
01:43:10,942 --> 01:43:12,566
Yes.

1391
01:43:12,567 --> 01:43:15,398
Everyone take a good
look at this picture..

1392
01:43:15,692 --> 01:43:17,273
...and tell me where it is.

1393
01:43:17,442 --> 01:43:22,898
And whoever gives the
right answer will get a reward.

1394
01:43:23,067 --> 01:43:24,773
Me! Me! Me! Me!

1395
01:43:26,067 --> 01:43:27,148
Stop.

1396
01:43:28,692 --> 01:43:30,773
Reverse... reverse...

1397
01:43:31,817 --> 01:43:33,648
Wasn't he with Chand Nawab?

1398
01:43:37,942 --> 01:43:38,898
Come here.

1399
01:43:41,067 --> 01:43:42,066
Listen.

1400
01:43:42,067 --> 01:43:43,482
Catch him.

1401
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:54,523
Teacher, this is Switzerland.

1402
01:43:57,567 --> 01:43:59,732
Arshad, if you don't
know pass it to someone else.

1403
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:03,773
Honestly,
teacher, this is Switzerland.

1404
01:44:03,775 --> 01:44:05,398
See... it's written here in English.

1405
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:06,773
SWITZERLAND!

1406
01:44:11,317 --> 01:44:14,898
Munni, are you from Switzerland?

1407
01:44:19,025 --> 01:44:22,857
- Catch him.
- Stop.

1408
01:44:23,817 --> 01:44:27,023
Stop.

1409
01:44:28,817 --> 01:44:30,273
Where are you going? Stop.

1410
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:47,857
Stop.

1411
01:44:50,025 --> 01:44:53,398
Such mesmerizing mountains
are found in Kashmir.

1412
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:54,273
Kashmir?

1413
01:44:56,317 --> 01:44:57,357
Will I have to go back to India?

1414
01:44:59,192 --> 01:45:00,523
No, Mister.

1415
01:45:00,817 --> 01:45:02,732
We have a part of it too.

1416
01:45:02,942 --> 01:45:04,357
- What?
- Kashmir.

1417
01:45:08,775 --> 01:45:09,607
Dear.

1418
01:45:19,317 --> 01:45:22,398
Stop, please keep these
weapons in your car first.

1419
01:45:22,567 --> 01:45:25,523
Priest, did you see
a stranger lurking around?

1420
01:45:25,692 --> 01:45:28,648
There are no strangers
in the house of God.

1421
01:45:28,817 --> 01:45:30,398
This stranger can be dangerous.

1422
01:45:30,567 --> 01:45:32,107
He's an Indian spy.

1423
01:45:34,650 --> 01:45:38,398
You think I have the
formula for the atom bomb..

1424
01:45:38,567 --> 01:45:40,523
...which he'll come here to steal.

1425
01:45:40,525 --> 01:45:45,023
But if you see any strange,
then do inform us.

1426
01:45:45,025 --> 01:45:46,357
Of course.

1427
01:45:53,317 --> 01:45:55,107
It's difficult to get out of here.

1428
01:45:56,442 --> 01:45:57,898
What now?

1429
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:03,607
I have an idea.

1430
01:46:13,692 --> 01:46:16,148
Bajrang Bali how much more
are you going to test your devotee?

1431
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:17,273
You made me sleep in the mosque.

1432
01:46:17,442 --> 01:46:18,398
Made me wear this burqha

1433
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:21,648
Please help us find Munni's parents
before I get circumcised.

1434
01:46:21,817 --> 01:46:23,398
I'll be indebted to you.

1435
01:46:33,817 --> 01:46:36,023
- What?
- Oh, God!

1436
01:46:36,025 --> 01:46:37,816
He's gone to Pakistan.

1437
01:46:37,817 --> 01:46:41,273
You said he'll take Munni
to Attari station and come back.

1438
01:46:41,567 --> 01:46:43,148
How could he go to Pakistan?

1439
01:46:43,317 --> 01:46:44,898
Who gave him passport and visa?

1440
01:46:45,067 --> 01:46:46,398
He's gone without them.

1441
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:47,523
Without..

1442
01:46:47,525 --> 01:46:50,316
He's gone to Pakistan
without a passport and a visa.

1443
01:46:50,317 --> 01:46:52,398
Please calm down. You'll get sick.

1444
01:46:52,567 --> 01:46:56,023
You don't know what those
Pakistanis will do to him.

1445
01:47:00,650 --> 01:47:02,107
I can't handle even one.

1446
01:47:02,692 --> 01:47:04,273
And the priest has two.

1447
01:47:20,067 --> 01:47:21,273
The police must be
patrolling the roads.

1448
01:47:21,442 --> 01:47:24,773
Walk through the fields
to get to Khanewal.

1449
01:47:26,817 --> 01:47:28,148
Thank you.

1450
01:47:41,567 --> 01:47:43,523
You're doing a good deed.

1451
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:49,523
I'll pray to Allah
that you find her parents.

1452
01:47:54,567 --> 01:47:55,273
Goodbye.

1453
01:48:03,942 --> 01:48:06,023
What do you say?

1454
01:48:06,692 --> 01:48:08,023
Hail Lord Ram?

1455
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:13,523
Hail Lord Ram!

1456
01:48:27,442 --> 01:48:28,398
Shall we go?

1457
01:48:29,817 --> 01:48:31,607
This is all your fault.

1458
01:48:31,817 --> 01:48:34,023
If you hadn't been obstinate
about sending Munni home..

1459
01:48:34,025 --> 01:48:35,273
...Pawan wouldn't have gone himself.

1460
01:48:35,275 --> 01:48:37,607
He's badly in trouble because of you.

1461
01:48:37,817 --> 01:48:39,148
Now do something.

1462
01:48:39,567 --> 01:48:41,023
What can I do?

1463
01:48:41,650 --> 01:48:45,398
If you don't do anything, then
I'll go to Pakistan looking for him.

1464
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:46,357
What?

1465
01:48:47,567 --> 01:48:48,357
Oh, God!

1466
01:48:49,317 --> 01:48:50,773
Without a visa!

1467
01:48:54,442 --> 01:48:55,898
I can't wear this anymore.

1468
01:48:56,067 --> 01:48:57,691
I can't breathe or walk.

1469
01:48:57,692 --> 01:49:00,816
Look. One of us has
to pose as the wife.

1470
01:49:00,817 --> 01:49:02,816
The police are looking
for two men along with a child.

1471
01:49:02,817 --> 01:49:04,232
Then you pose as the wife.

1472
01:49:04,775 --> 01:49:05,648
I see.

1473
01:49:05,817 --> 01:49:07,148
If anyone asks,
you will readily tell him..

1474
01:49:07,317 --> 01:49:11,023
...that my name is Pawan
Kumar Chaturvedi, I am from India.

1475
01:49:11,025 --> 01:49:12,191
I am a devotee of Bajrang Bali.

1476
01:49:12,192 --> 01:49:13,148
I took permission to get here.

1477
01:49:13,150 --> 01:49:14,148
And I have come crawling
under the fences.

1478
01:49:14,150 --> 01:49:14,773
Right. Munni?

1479
01:49:16,275 --> 01:49:17,648
Look, people are coming.

1480
01:49:17,817 --> 01:49:20,357
Cover your face. Come on.

1481
01:49:21,442 --> 01:49:23,273
And walk with some grace.

1482
01:49:36,067 --> 01:49:38,648
Munni... will you do one thing for me?

1483
01:49:40,817 --> 01:49:42,523
Munni is going to get caught.

1484
01:49:44,025 --> 01:49:45,023
Mister.

1485
01:49:47,317 --> 01:49:48,857
- Mister.
- She's safe.

1486
01:50:17,067 --> 01:50:18,023
This is wrong?

1487
01:50:18,317 --> 01:50:20,316
Things always go wrong when you lie.

1488
01:50:20,317 --> 01:50:21,316
You wait and watch.

1489
01:50:21,317 --> 01:50:22,773
You spoke again, dear.

1490
01:50:23,442 --> 01:50:24,898
Cover your face.

1491
01:50:31,817 --> 01:50:34,148
This car's just..

1492
01:50:35,942 --> 01:50:38,523
Mister. Can I help you?

1493
01:50:39,192 --> 01:50:40,107
Come on.

1494
01:50:45,067 --> 01:50:45,898
Sit inside.

1495
01:50:46,067 --> 01:50:48,523
You hit the ignition,
when I tell you to.

1496
01:50:58,567 --> 01:51:00,148
Yes, did you find anything?

1497
01:51:00,317 --> 01:51:03,066
Takes time, mister. Takes time sir,
to find the right nerve.

1498
01:51:03,067 --> 01:51:04,898
Are you a mechanic or a physician?

1499
01:51:16,442 --> 01:51:17,732
Turn it on?

1500
01:51:21,317 --> 01:51:22,773
What did you do?

1501
01:51:22,775 --> 01:51:24,148
Again.

1502
01:51:25,692 --> 01:51:26,773
This is what I did.

1503
01:51:27,067 --> 01:51:29,773
You fixed it.

1504
01:51:30,192 --> 01:51:32,773
It's our duty to
help fellow companions.

1505
01:51:32,942 --> 01:51:34,773
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.

1506
01:51:35,775 --> 01:51:39,482
Can I drop you somewhere?

1507
01:51:44,067 --> 01:51:45,232
What's your name, Dear?

1508
01:51:46,067 --> 01:51:48,482
She can't talk, sir?
She's mute.

1509
01:51:49,567 --> 01:51:50,648
Yes.

1510
01:51:50,650 --> 01:51:52,773
How does a mother feel?

1511
01:51:54,067 --> 01:51:56,773
What do the doctors say, ma'am?

1512
01:51:56,775 --> 01:51:58,773
She can't talk either?

1513
01:51:58,942 --> 01:52:00,148
Same-to-same.

1514
01:52:00,317 --> 01:52:02,316
It's hereditary.

1515
01:52:02,317 --> 01:52:03,273
Oh my.

1516
01:52:03,442 --> 01:52:05,107
It's fate.

1517
01:52:05,525 --> 01:52:07,398
Yes, that's true.

1518
01:52:07,692 --> 01:52:11,898
You're heading towards Khanewal,
aren't you?

1519
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:17,441
No. But don't worry,
I'll get you home.

1520
01:52:17,442 --> 01:52:21,898
No, no, no need to take the trouble.
Just drop us at the highway.

1521
01:52:22,067 --> 01:52:23,898
It won't be a problem at all.

1522
01:52:24,192 --> 01:52:26,148
I will tell one of my constables

1523
01:52:26,150 --> 01:52:29,023
and he'll drop you home in his jeep.

1524
01:52:29,025 --> 01:52:30,982
Yes..
Constable.

1525
01:52:31,275 --> 01:52:33,523
Yes, I am the area inspector.

1526
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,107
I was on leave today.

1527
01:52:36,775 --> 01:52:39,566
But I am going back because
there's an emergency.

1528
01:52:39,567 --> 01:52:41,316
Emergency?

1529
01:52:41,317 --> 01:52:43,857
An Indian spy is at large here.

1530
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:55,232
Let's see how long he can escape for!

1531
01:52:55,567 --> 01:52:58,773
- Where's Chand Nawab?
- I don't know.

1532
01:52:58,942 --> 01:52:59,773
You don't know.

1533
01:52:59,942 --> 01:53:00,648
I don't know.

1534
01:53:00,817 --> 01:53:02,648
I swear I don't know.

1535
01:53:02,817 --> 01:53:08,148
The last I saw him,
he was boarding the bus after the spy

1536
01:53:08,442 --> 01:53:09,566
I tried calling him.

1537
01:53:09,567 --> 01:53:11,648
But his phone's switched off.

1538
01:53:16,275 --> 01:53:19,232
Call him right now...
in front of me...

1539
01:53:27,692 --> 01:53:29,148
It's switched off.

1540
01:53:37,942 --> 01:53:39,148
Come. Mister.

1541
01:53:39,317 --> 01:53:41,107
I've reached my destination.

1542
01:53:41,817 --> 01:53:45,148
Now my man will take you to yours.

1543
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:47,398
- Sir.
- Sir.

1544
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:48,066
Sir..

1545
01:53:48,067 --> 01:53:48,982
Come.

1546
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:50,773
- Hasan.
- Yes, sir.

1547
01:53:51,067 --> 01:53:52,232
- Come here.
- Yes.

1548
01:53:52,567 --> 01:53:54,773
They are my special guests.

1549
01:53:54,775 --> 01:53:56,732
And he is a great mechanic as well.

1550
01:53:56,942 --> 01:53:59,648
Take them to their home in Khanewal.

1551
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:00,898
Yes, sir. Come.

1552
01:54:01,192 --> 01:54:02,148
Thank you. Sir.

1553
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:05,066
No, thank you.
You really helped me a lot.

1554
01:54:05,067 --> 01:54:06,648
How about some snacks before you go?

1555
01:54:06,817 --> 01:54:09,148
- No, we'll go.
- Come.

1556
01:54:09,567 --> 01:54:10,398
Come.

1557
01:54:13,192 --> 01:54:14,148
Come. Sit.

1558
01:54:19,192 --> 01:54:20,148
Carefully.

1559
01:54:28,775 --> 01:54:32,398
Goodbye.

1560
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,398
Keep calling him every hour.

1561
01:54:35,567 --> 01:54:37,398
He'll pickup sometime.

1562
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:54,773
- Where is your house?
- Just a little ahead.

1563
01:54:57,067 --> 01:54:58,773
You don't know the way.

1564
01:55:00,275 --> 01:55:03,023
We're coming back after a long time.

1565
01:55:04,025 --> 01:55:05,566
Actually we ran away and got married.

1566
01:55:05,567 --> 01:55:07,232
So her father's angry with us.

1567
01:55:09,317 --> 01:55:10,441
This is it.

1568
01:55:10,442 --> 01:55:11,898
- Stop here.
- It's this one.

1569
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,523
Thank God we found your home.

1570
01:55:14,692 --> 01:55:16,648
You even forgot your home.

1571
01:55:16,650 --> 01:55:19,023
- What can I say?
- It's alright.

1572
01:55:19,317 --> 01:55:21,023
Call Waqar.

1573
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:24,773
Yes, sir.

1574
01:55:24,942 --> 01:55:27,398
What's the information
on that spy from headquarters?

1575
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:29,773
Sir the spy's name
is Pawan aka Bajrangi.

1576
01:55:29,942 --> 01:55:31,691
And there's a local
journalist accompanying him.

1577
01:55:31,692 --> 01:55:32,816
Chand Nawab.

1578
01:55:32,817 --> 01:55:35,691
- Come, I'll see you in.
- No. Thank you.

1579
01:55:35,692 --> 01:55:38,523
Thank you for bringing us here.

1580
01:55:38,525 --> 01:55:39,773
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1581
01:55:39,775 --> 01:55:41,023
Take care.

1582
01:55:55,067 --> 01:55:56,566
Father. How are you?

1583
01:55:56,567 --> 01:55:58,773
- Who are you?
- Forsake your anger.

1584
01:55:58,775 --> 01:56:00,773
Look, I've brought your
daughter and granddaughter.

1585
01:56:00,775 --> 01:56:01,857
Come, dear.

1586
01:56:03,442 --> 01:56:05,857
Who is this child
and what is she doing?

1587
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:07,816
But I don't have a daughter.

1588
01:56:07,817 --> 01:56:10,523
There's no point in
arguing on the streets.

1589
01:56:10,692 --> 01:56:12,523
Let's go inside and you can scold me
as much as you want

1590
01:56:12,692 --> 01:56:16,398
- I don't know you..
- We got married without your permission.

1591
01:56:16,567 --> 01:56:18,441
- You're angry with us.
- But..

1592
01:56:18,442 --> 01:56:20,691
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.

1593
01:56:20,692 --> 01:56:24,523
- Hit me. Hit me.
- Uncle, forget it.

1594
01:56:24,817 --> 01:56:26,648
Oh come on. Hit me.

1595
01:56:27,067 --> 01:56:28,441
Hit me.

1596
01:56:28,442 --> 01:56:31,023
Let's go in.

1597
01:56:31,275 --> 01:56:33,316
- Why do I go in?
- Forget it uncle.

1598
01:56:33,317 --> 01:56:34,398
Dear.

1599
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:35,357
Get my shoe.

1600
01:56:35,567 --> 01:56:37,148
Someone's barging in our house.

1601
01:56:37,317 --> 01:56:39,773
Oh God!

1602
01:56:40,317 --> 01:56:41,523
Come on.

1603
01:56:41,525 --> 01:56:43,148
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1604
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:48,316
And there's a little girl with them.

1605
01:56:48,317 --> 01:56:50,232
Little girl? How old?

1606
01:56:50,442 --> 01:56:51,857
Around 5 or 6 years old.

1607
01:56:52,317 --> 01:56:53,898
5-6... years.

1608
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:56,523
- And she can't speak!
- She can't speak?

1609
01:56:56,692 --> 01:56:57,523
Yes, sir.

1610
01:56:57,692 --> 01:56:59,898
Don't just stand
there and stare at me.

1611
01:57:00,442 --> 01:57:02,648
Radio Hasan immediately.

1612
01:57:06,025 --> 01:57:07,566
- Uncle.
- Who is it?

1613
01:57:07,567 --> 01:57:08,648
Uncle. Open the door.

1614
01:57:08,650 --> 01:57:10,773
Don't break down the door.

1615
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:14,273
- You?
- Where are they?

1616
01:57:14,442 --> 01:57:14,898
Who?

1617
01:57:15,067 --> 01:57:16,523
Your daughter and son-in-law.

1618
01:57:16,692 --> 01:57:18,023
How many times do I have to tell you..

1619
01:57:18,192 --> 01:57:19,773
...I don't have a
daughter or a son-in-law.

1620
01:57:19,775 --> 01:57:21,566
Where are those people..

1621
01:57:21,567 --> 01:57:23,523
...who were calling themselves
your daughter and son-in-law?

1622
01:57:23,692 --> 01:57:24,691
I don't know.

1623
01:57:24,692 --> 01:57:27,148

1662
02:00:53,650 --> 02:00:56,441
Chand Nawab. I was thinking about..

1663
02:00:56,442 --> 02:00:58,357
...turning myself over to the police.

1664
02:00:59,025 --> 02:01:03,773
Then somehow the police
will find her home.

1665
02:01:03,942 --> 02:01:05,398
Don't even think about it.

1666
02:01:05,942 --> 02:01:07,523
You will rot in jail
for the rest of your life..

1667
02:01:07,692 --> 02:01:09,523
And no one will ever have a clue.

1668
02:01:09,692 --> 02:01:11,816
And what do you think the police..

1669
02:01:11,817 --> 02:01:13,648
Are going to try as hard as you,
to find her house?

1670
02:01:13,817 --> 02:01:15,066
They will look for a day or two..

1671
02:01:15,067 --> 02:01:17,898
...and then they will
send Munni to some orphanage.

1672
02:01:18,692 --> 02:01:20,357
I won't let that happen.

1673
02:01:20,650 --> 02:01:22,607
I promised Bajrang Bali..

1674
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:24,648
...that I will take Munni home.

1675
02:01:25,442 --> 02:01:26,898
And I will.

1676
02:01:29,650 --> 02:01:32,273
<i>- Listen..
- I can clearly say that..</i>

1677
02:01:32,275 --> 02:01:34,316
<i>I challenge all of you..</i>

1678
02:01:34,317 --> 02:01:36,273
There is one way to help you.

1679
02:01:39,025 --> 02:01:39,773
TV!

1680
02:01:40,442 --> 02:01:41,316
TV?

1681
02:01:41,317 --> 02:01:42,691
There is no weight in the story.

1682
02:01:42,692 --> 02:01:44,066
<i>What are you saying, sir?</i>

1683
02:01:44,067 --> 02:01:48,273
<i>An Indian is helping
a Pakistani mute girl.</i>

1684
02:01:48,275 --> 02:01:50,148
According to me it's
an explosive story.

1685
02:01:50,317 --> 02:01:53,816
No, but your story
on the spy was much better.

1686
02:01:53,817 --> 02:01:54,648
<i>What about that?</i>

1687
02:01:54,650 --> 02:01:58,066
- But, sir, he's not a spy.
- That's that, then.

1688
02:01:58,067 --> 02:01:59,691
Goodbye.

1689
02:01:59,692 --> 02:02:01,066
Hello. Hello.

1690
02:02:01,067 --> 02:02:02,232
Sir..

1691
02:02:07,150 --> 02:02:09,398
What's the point
of showing this story?

1692
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:12,441
A child will be re-united
with her parents.

1693
02:02:12,442 --> 02:02:13,648
<i>Reunite with her parents?</i>

1694
02:02:13,817 --> 02:02:16,398
Look, we sell news..

1695
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,441
<i>... this is not Hazrat
Amin Shah's shrine..</i>

1696
02:02:18,442 --> 02:02:19,648
Where we re-unite the separated.

1697
02:02:19,817 --> 02:02:21,773
- But, sir..
- Goodbye then.

1698
02:02:22,692 --> 02:02:23,898
Hello.

1699
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:31,648
Hatred is easy to sell.

1700
02:02:32,442 --> 02:02:33,607
But love..

1701
02:02:35,817 --> 02:02:37,648
What is Hazrat Amin Shah's shrine?

1702
02:02:39,567 --> 02:02:41,316
It's a famous shrine.

1703
02:02:41,317 --> 02:02:43,357
It's said that everyone's
wishes get fulfilled there.

1704
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:46,607
- Why haven't we gone there yet?
- I see.

1705
02:02:47,025 --> 02:02:49,691
Every time you see a shrine or mosque,
you turn pale.

1706
02:02:49,692 --> 02:02:51,273
Remember when we
were in Alipur mosque.

1707
02:02:51,442 --> 02:02:53,273
You ran like you had seen a ghost.

1708
02:03:02,650 --> 02:03:05,398
I am willing to go
to any shrine for Munni.

1709
02:03:06,192 --> 02:03:07,982
Then let's catch a bus tonight.

1710
02:03:09,942 --> 02:03:11,648
It's ringing.

1711
02:03:17,817 --> 02:03:19,773
- Kaamil.
- Hello, brother Chand.

1712
02:03:19,942 --> 02:03:21,316
Thank God. I was worried for you.

1713
02:03:21,317 --> 02:03:22,398
Where are you?

1714
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:26,273
- Is there anyone around you?
- No. There's no one.

1715
02:03:26,275 --> 02:03:27,773
Where are you? With that spy?

1716
02:03:28,192 --> 02:03:30,691
He's not a spy. He's a very nice man.

1717
02:03:30,692 --> 02:03:32,023
What do you mean by he's not a spy?

1718
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,898
He only came here
to bring a girl home.

1719
02:03:35,067 --> 02:03:37,648
But where are you now?

1720
02:03:37,650 --> 02:03:39,732
We're going to Hazrat
Amin Shah's shrine.

1721
02:03:41,025 --> 02:03:43,566
It's said that everyone's
wishes get fulfilled there.

1722
02:03:43,567 --> 02:03:46,023
Okay, brother, take care.
Goodbye.

1723
02:03:46,192 --> 02:03:46,898

This is Chand Nawab.

1745
02:05:35,692 --> 02:05:38,148
And today I am going
to tell you about a man..

1746
02:05:38,150 --> 02:05:40,273
...who entered our
country without a visa..

1747
02:05:40,275 --> 02:05:44,523
...by crawling under the border fences,
and his name is Bajrangi.

Just like the police,
even I believed..

1755
02:06:06,192 --> 02:06:07,898
...that this man is an Indian spy.

1756
02:06:08,067 --> 02:06:11,773
But now... I know he is not a spy.

1757
02:06:12,817 --> 02:06:14,398
Then who is he?

1758
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,648
Why did he come to our country?
What does he want?

1759
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:18,898
Bajrangi is a common
man like you and me..

1760
02:06:19,067 --> 02:06:21,523
...and he has just one
motive for coming here.

1761
02:06:21,692 --> 02:06:22,648
Love.

1762
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:26,523
His love for a 6 year
old Pakistani mute girl..

1763
02:06:26,692 --> 02:06:29,523
...who got separated
from her parents in India.

1764
02:06:29,692 --> 02:06:31,523
When all other options failed..

1765
02:06:31,525 --> 02:06:35,148
...Bajrangi had only this one option
left to reunite her with her parents.

He isn't answering.

1824
02:10:23,817 --> 02:10:24,898
Answer the phone.

1825
02:10:26,692 --> 02:10:28,148
- Answer the phone.
- Why?

1826
02:10:28,150 --> 02:10:29,357
I'll tell you.

1827
02:10:30,067 --> 02:10:32,898
He picked it up.
Hello, brother Chand. Are you okay?

1828
02:10:33,150 --> 02:10:34,273
Yes.

1829
02:10:34,442 --> 02:10:37,523
- Did you go to the shrine?
- Yes, I did last night.

1830
02:10:37,692 --> 02:10:39,191
To pray for Munni.

1831
02:10:39,192 --> 02:10:41,566
I see, so where are you now?

1832
02:10:41,567 --> 02:10:45,732
Now... we just left for Gojra

1833
02:10:47,067 --> 02:10:48,648
You left for Gojra?

1834
02:10:48,817 --> 02:10:52,066
- I see.
- Okay, I'll call you later.

1835
02:10:52,067 --> 02:10:54,273
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

1836
02:10:54,692 --> 02:10:58,523
- Brother, finally you lied.
- No. I didn't.

1837
02:10:58,692 --> 02:11:01,273
- But you made me lie.
- So what?

1838
02:11:01,442 --> 02:11:03,648
Haven't you see
Mahabharat on television?

1839
02:11:04,442 --> 02:11:05,607
Is it a movie?

1840
02:11:10,025 --> 02:11:11,232
Is it a new movie?

1841
02:11:12,067 --> 02:11:14,566
If you recognize this girl,
or know anything about her..

1842
02:11:14,567 --> 02:11:18,316
...then please leave your
phone number on this website.

1843
02:11:18,317 --> 02:11:19,523
We will definitely call you.

1844
02:11:19,692 --> 02:11:20,648
<i>With cameraman Chand...</i>

1845
02:11:20,650 --> 02:11:22,857
I have put shots of both
of you two in the video.

1846
02:11:23,525 --> 02:11:25,773
The Internet is a powerful tool,
brother.

1847
02:11:25,942 --> 02:11:27,648
Did anyone leave their number?

1848
02:11:28,692 --> 02:11:31,482
Only a Few people have seen it so far.
It will grow soon.

1849
02:11:33,817 --> 02:11:35,773
Munni, do you want to watch?

1850
02:11:35,942 --> 02:11:37,273
Let me rewind it.

1851
02:11:50,442 --> 02:11:52,398
Move aside.

1852
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:53,816
What happened, Munni?

1853
02:11:53,817 --> 02:11:54,898
What did you see. Munni?

1854
02:11:55,525 --> 02:11:56,273
Rewind. Rewind.

1855
02:11:56,442 --> 02:11:57,607
What happened, Munni?

1856
02:12:05,150 --> 02:12:06,398
Pause. Pause. Pause.

1857
02:12:07,775 --> 02:12:09,523
You know her?

1858
02:12:10,775 --> 02:12:12,607
Is she your mother?

1859
02:12:14,192 --> 02:12:15,482
Rewind. Rewind.

1860
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:20,148
<i>Look Chand Bhai, she got off the bus!</i>

1861
02:12:20,567 --> 02:12:21,898
<i>What time did that bus arrive?</i>

1862
02:12:22,192 --> 02:12:23,898
Around 8:30.

1863
02:12:24,317 --> 02:12:27,023
Find out where the
8:30 bus comes from?

1864
02:12:34,650 --> 02:12:36,607
<i>It's here. It's here.</i>

1865
02:12:43,525 --> 02:12:45,523
Brother,
where is this bus coming from?

1866
02:12:45,525 --> 02:12:46,816
Where do you want to go?

1867
02:12:46,817 --> 02:12:48,398
We want to know where
it's coming from?

1868
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:49,773
You're a strange man.

1869
02:12:49,775 --> 02:12:52,648
Strange or not, first tell
us where the bus is coming from?

1870
02:12:53,317 --> 02:12:55,066
Jehanabad.

1871
02:12:55,067 --> 02:12:57,523
Munni, is your village's
name Jehanabad?

1872
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:04,273
And before that comes Ursail.

1873
02:13:04,442 --> 02:13:05,648
Ursail.

1874
02:13:07,150 --> 02:13:10,691
And before that comes Karimabad.

1875
02:13:10,692 --> 02:13:11,857
Karimabad.

1876
02:13:13,025 --> 02:13:14,691
And before that..

1877
02:13:14,692 --> 02:13:16,232
District Sultanpur.

1878
02:13:18,025 --> 02:13:19,357
District Sultanpur?

1879
02:13:22,067 --> 02:13:24,773
Munni, you're from Sultanpur!?

1880
02:13:24,775 --> 02:13:26,023
She is from Sultanpur.

1881
02:13:30,692 --> 02:13:33,648
Munni's from Sultanpur.

1882
02:13:34,192 --> 02:13:35,898
Sultanpur.

1883
02:13:51,692 --> 02:13:52,482
Sir.

1884
02:13:55,817 --> 02:13:57,273
Sir, take a look at this video.

1885
02:13:57,942 --> 02:14:00,648
Chand Nawab posted
this video yesterday.

1886
02:14:01,025 --> 02:14:03,066
And today I am going to tell you about...

1887
02:14:03,067 --> 02:14:04,148
This is just outside the mosque.

1888
02:14:04,317 --> 02:14:05,816
Sir, they never came to Gojra.

1889
02:14:05,817 --> 02:14:08,273
We checked all the houses,
offices and shops.

1890
02:14:08,275 --> 02:14:09,732
They aren't here.

1891
02:14:10,275 --> 02:14:14,023
Send pictures from this video
to all the inspectors in the area.

1892
02:14:14,025 --> 02:14:16,316
And stop all vehicles and check them.

1893
02:14:16,317 --> 02:14:17,732
- Immediately.
- Yes, sir.

1894
02:14:25,817 --> 02:14:27,523
Did you spot your village?

1895
02:14:33,817 --> 02:14:34,773
Brother.

1896
02:14:41,650 --> 02:14:43,148
Listen to me carefully.

1897
02:14:43,567 --> 02:14:45,523
Come on, get down.

1898
02:14:45,692 --> 02:14:47,273
Bring the vehicle forward.

1899
02:14:48,067 --> 02:14:50,148
- Come on, get down.
- Everyone get in a line.

1900
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:52,523
Come up.

1901
02:14:52,775 --> 02:14:53,523
Hurry up.

1902
02:14:53,692 --> 02:14:54,607
Come on.

1903
02:14:55,692 --> 02:14:57,273
Go ahead.

1904
02:14:59,317 --> 02:15:00,357
Take off your shawl!

1905
02:15:01,025 --> 02:15:03,107
Take it off!

1906
02:15:09,942 --> 02:15:11,648
Catch him. That's him.

1907
02:15:15,650 --> 02:15:17,148
Hey wait.

1908
02:15:27,442 --> 02:15:28,898
- Catch him.
- Come on.

1909
02:15:30,567 --> 02:15:32,398
Where are you running off too?

1910
02:15:40,942 --> 02:15:42,191
Surround him.

1911
02:15:42,192 --> 02:15:42,898
Stop.

1912
02:15:53,317 --> 02:15:55,148
Catch him.

<i>And today I am going
to tell you about a man..</i>

1925
02:19:13,566 --> 02:19:15,273
...who entered our
country without a visa..

1926
02:19:15,441 --> 02:19:19,523
<i>... by crawling under the border fences,
and his name is Bajrangi.</i>

1927
02:19:19,816 --> 02:19:21,398
<i>Just like the police,
even I believed..</i>

1928
02:19:21,566 --> 02:19:22,773
<i>... that this man is an Indian spy.</i>

1929
02:19:23,025 --> 02:19:26,398
<i>But now... I know he is not a spy.</i>

1930
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:27,898
<i>Then who is he?</i>

1931
02:19:28,566 --> 02:19:29,773
<i>Why did he come to our country?</i>

1932
02:19:29,775 --> 02:19:30,773
<i>What does he want?</i>

1933
02:19:31,066 --> 02:19:33,148
<i>Bajrangi is a common
man like you and me..</i>

1934
02:19:33,316 --> 02:19:36,398
<i>... and he has just one
motive for coming here.</i>

1935
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:37,523
<i>Love.</i>

1936
02:19:37,525 --> 02:19:40,608
<i>His love for a 6 year
old Pakistani mute girl..</i>

1937
02:19:41,066 --> 02:19:43,608
<i>... who got separated
from her parents in India.</i>

1938
02:19:43,941 --> 02:19:45,690
<i>When all other options failed..</i>

1939
02:19:45,691 --> 02:19:49,523
<i>Bajrangi had only this one option left
to reunite her with her parents.</i>

1940
02:19:49,691 --> 02:19:52,190
<i>Every channel has refused
to show this story.</i>

1941
02:19:52,191 --> 02:19:53,815
<i>They say it's nonsense.</i>

1942
02:19:53,816 --> 02:19:56,023
<i>No one's interested in it.</i>

1943
02:19:56,816 --> 02:19:58,815
<i>So please help Bajrangi Bhaijaan..</i>

1944
02:19:58,816 --> 02:20:02,315
<i>... so that he can take this kid home,
and return to his country..</i>

1945
02:20:02,316 --> 02:20:04,398
<i>... safe and sound.</i>

1946
02:20:04,566 --> 02:20:07,148
<i>If you recognize this girl,
or know anything about her..</i>

1947
02:20:07,316 --> 02:20:10,315
<i>... then please paste your
phone number on this website.</i>

1948
02:20:10,316 --> 02:20:11,690
<i>We will definitely call you.</i>

1949
02:20:11,691 --> 02:20:15,523
<i>This is Chand Nawab,
with cameraman Chand Nawab. Kashmir.</i>

1950
02:20:37,775 --> 02:20:42,898
<i>I don't care what the press, the
media and the common man are thinking.</i>

1951
02:20:43,275 --> 02:20:45,773
For us he's an Indian spy.

1952
02:20:45,775 --> 02:20:48,358
But Sir. The child's
parents have confirmed

1953
02:20:48,691 --> 02:20:49,898
that she did get separated in India.

1954
02:20:50,066 --> 02:20:51,773
But, sir, the people of Pakistan

1955
02:20:51,941 --> 02:20:53,773
...are growing sympathetic towards him.

1956
02:20:55,275 --> 02:20:59,648
So then... tell the press and the media..

1957
02:20:59,816 --> 02:21:03,523
...that he has admitted
that he's an Indian spy.

1958
02:21:04,441 --> 02:21:07,523
Then we'll see about
the people's sympathy.

1959
02:21:14,566 --> 02:21:17,315
Tell your men to get
information from India quickly.

1960
02:21:17,316 --> 02:21:18,483
Sir.

1961
02:21:21,316 --> 02:21:25,523
This child couldn't speak,
I remember that clearly.

1962
02:21:25,941 --> 02:21:27,983
Yes, and this man brought her here.

1963
02:21:28,316 --> 02:21:29,773
He was saying she's lost.

1964
02:21:36,191 --> 02:21:37,398
Stop it.

1965
02:21:38,941 --> 02:21:39,523
Hello.

1966
02:21:39,775 --> 02:21:40,773
Sir, Kurukshetra Police Station..

1967
02:21:40,941 --> 02:21:44,440
...and our men at the Delhi
Commission have verified his story.

1968
02:21:44,441 --> 02:21:46,523
<i>He did go there with this girl.</i>

1969
02:21:46,816 --> 02:21:48,273
This man can't be a spy.

1970
02:21:48,525 --> 02:21:52,398
You don't get to decide who's what

1971
02:21:52,566 --> 02:21:53,523
That's my job!

1972
02:21:53,691 --> 02:21:55,773
<i>Your job is to make him confess</i>

1973
02:21:55,775 --> 02:21:57,273
...that he's a spy.
- But, sir..

1974
02:21:57,525 --> 02:22:01,398
<i>And yes, if you can't
do this job then tell me now.</i>

1975
02:22:01,775 --> 02:22:04,023
We have other capable officers.

1976
02:22:04,025 --> 02:22:06,773
And I think you might need a vacation.

1977
02:22:18,066 --> 02:22:20,773
They want Pawan's
confession at any cost.

1978
02:22:24,816 --> 02:22:26,483
All my life I've worked towards..

1979
02:22:26,691 --> 02:22:30,023
...the glory and protection
of this country.

1980
02:22:31,816 --> 02:22:35,858
But if this man..

1981
02:22:39,691 --> 02:22:45,233
If this man is thrown in Pakistani
jail for the rest of his life..

1982
02:22:46,275 --> 02:22:49,023
...then that will be against
the glory of our country.

1983
02:22:54,816 --> 02:22:56,483
And I won't let that happen.

1984
02:23:03,441 --> 02:23:04,358
Hello.

1985
02:23:04,691 --> 02:23:05,773
Who?

1986
02:23:07,066 --> 02:23:09,148
Hamid sir.

1987
02:23:09,816 --> 02:23:10,773
Yes, sir.

1988
02:23:11,650 --> 02:23:12,483
Yes.

1989
02:23:15,316 --> 02:23:16,273
Yes, sir.

1990
02:23:18,566 --> 02:23:19,773
Thank you.

1991
02:23:20,191 --> 02:23:23,148
Very good. Sir.

1992
02:23:23,691 --> 02:23:24,608
Thank you. Sir.

1993
02:23:24,816 --> 02:23:26,065
Get the camera out. Come on.

1994
02:23:26,066 --> 02:23:27,273
Get the camera out.

1995
02:23:27,275 --> 02:23:28,358
Come on.

1996
02:23:30,775 --> 02:23:32,733
Sir.

1997
02:23:33,691 --> 02:23:36,398
Sir, there's a new video
on the Bajrangi story.

1998
02:23:38,816 --> 02:23:41,483
- Okay, roll the bulletin.
- Okay, sir.

1999
02:23:41,691 --> 02:23:44,273
Sister Rasika.

2000
02:23:44,441 --> 02:23:47,023
Brother Bajrangi's on television.

2001
02:23:47,025 --> 02:23:50,773
Pakistani reporter Chand
Nawab has posted a new video..

2002
02:23:50,775 --> 02:23:53,440
<i>... of Pawan Chaturvedi,
aka Bajrangi Bhaijaan..</i>

2003
02:23:53,441 --> 02:23:55,398
<i>... who is locked up in Pakistan jail.</i>

2004
02:24:01,025 --> 02:24:04,773
<i>Pawan Chanturvedi,
or better known as Bajrangi Bhaijaan..</i>

2005
02:24:04,941 --> 02:24:08,148
<i>... is an Indian who risked
his life to reunite..</i>

2006
02:24:08,150 --> 02:24:12,273
<i>... a small child with
her parents in Pakistan.</i>

2007
02:24:12,775 --> 02:24:14,398
Run this story immediately.

2008
02:24:14,566 --> 02:24:16,148
Why did Bajrangi do such a thing?

2009
02:24:16,316 --> 02:24:18,898
<i>For money, fame...</i>

2010
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:19,940
<i>No!</i>

2011
02:24:19,941 --> 02:24:23,440
Bajrangi did this because
he has a clean and honest heart.

2012
02:24:23,441 --> 02:24:27,190
<i>He did it because,
he didn't see Shahida as a Pakistani..</i>

2013
02:24:27,191 --> 02:24:30,608
<i>... but as another human being.</i>

2014
02:24:31,775 --> 02:24:33,773
<i>But unfortunately, this godsent</i>

2015
02:24:33,941 --> 02:24:36,523
<i>... is stuck amidst the
hatred between the two countries.</i>

2016
02:24:36,941 --> 02:24:39,190
<i>And today,
this hatred has forced Bajrangi..</i>

2017
02:24:39,191 --> 02:24:41,858
<i>... to hide like a criminal in Pakistan.</i>

2018
02:24:42,566 --> 02:24:44,523
Let's end this hatred now.

2019
02:24:44,941 --> 02:24:46,523
<i>And we need to do this.</i>

2020
02:24:46,525 --> 02:24:48,773
We the people of both the countries..

2021
02:24:48,941 --> 02:24:52,148
<i>... who want to raise our
children with love. Not hatred.</i>

2022
02:24:52,441 --> 02:24:55,773
So come, let's finish this hatred.

2023
02:24:56,691 --> 02:24:59,773
Tomorrow morning... let's together
head towards Narowal Checkpost.

2024
02:24:59,941 --> 02:25:01,023
What nonsense is this?

2025
02:25:01,191 --> 02:25:02,648
Seal the Narowal border.

2026
02:25:02,650 --> 02:25:05,648
<i>Let the people from both the
countries come there and see to it..</i>

2027
02:25:05,816 --> 02:25:08,898
...that no one stops Pawan Charutvedi,
my Bajrangi..

2028
02:25:08,900 --> 02:25:10,523
...from crossing the border!

2029
02:25:10,691 --> 02:25:12,398
Or stop him from going home.

2030
02:25:12,400 --> 02:25:15,023
With cameraman Kamil Yusuf,
this is Chand Nawab.

2031
02:26:53,691 --> 02:26:55,773
Chand... Munni?

2032
02:26:56,316 --> 02:27:00,273
Brother, we have fulfilled our
promise made to Bajrang Bali.

2033
02:27:00,816 --> 02:27:01,773
Munni...

2034
02:27:01,941 --> 02:27:03,023
Shahida.

2035
02:27:03,025 --> 02:27:05,148
Shahida is with her parents now.

2036
02:27:06,150 --> 02:27:07,233
Shahida?

2037
02:27:07,816 --> 02:27:10,398
Yes, Shahida.

2038
02:27:12,150 --> 02:27:12,773
Shahida.

2039
02:27:12,941 --> 02:27:13,898
Pawan.

2040
02:27:14,316 --> 02:27:15,773
Let's go, Pawan.
Come on.

2041
02:27:24,816 --> 02:27:25,648
Come.

2042
02:27:26,691 --> 02:27:28,023
Do come back.

2043
02:27:30,066 --> 02:27:32,023
And this time don't
crawl under the fence.

2044
02:27:32,025 --> 02:27:33,648
But with a proper visa.

2045
02:27:34,775 --> 02:27:35,648
I promise.

2046
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:38,523
Come on.

2047
02:27:39,316 --> 02:28:06,815
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2048
02:28:06,816 --> 02:28:07,815
Stop.

2049
02:28:07,816 --> 02:28:08,815
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2050
02:28:08,816 --> 02:28:09,773
Open the gate.

2051
02:28:09,941 --> 02:28:12,690
Sir, we have orders to arrest you.

2052
02:28:12,691 --> 02:28:14,233
If this man had risked his life..

2053
02:28:14,441 --> 02:28:19,773
...to bring back your lost child,
wouldn't you have opened the gate?

2054
02:28:19,941 --> 02:28:22,648
You know... I can't open the gate.

2055
02:28:22,650 --> 02:28:27,523
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2056
02:28:27,691 --> 02:28:29,148
Do you hear these voices?

2057
02:28:29,316 --> 02:28:30,648
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2058
02:28:30,650 --> 02:28:32,358
It's the voice of
the people of Pakistan.

2059
02:28:32,650 --> 02:28:35,648
If they can see the difference
between right and wrong..

2060
02:28:35,650 --> 02:28:36,690
...then why can't you?

2061
02:28:36,691 --> 02:28:37,773
You're a soldier.

2062
02:28:38,316 --> 02:28:40,273
You know better.

2063
02:28:40,441 --> 02:28:42,023
We have orders, sir.

2064
02:28:42,941 --> 02:28:45,108
To stop this man from
crossing the border.

2065
02:28:46,816 --> 02:28:48,023
But...

2066
02:28:51,316 --> 02:28:52,608
There's just a handful of us..

2067
02:28:55,441 --> 02:28:57,648
...compared to the thousands of you.

2068
02:28:57,650 --> 02:29:01,273
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2069
02:29:01,441 --> 02:29:02,523
Do you understand?

2070
02:29:02,691 --> 02:30:30,523
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2071
02:30:30,525 --> 02:30:32,440
- Bajrangi Bhaijaan!
- Shahida.

2072
02:30:32,441 --> 02:31:08,648
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2073
02:31:08,816 --> 02:31:11,148
- Bajrangi Bhaijaan!
- Shahida.

2074
02:31:11,316 --> 02:31:24,565
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2075
02:31:24,566 --> 02:31:25,523
Pawan.

2076
02:31:25,525 --> 02:31:32,898
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2077
02:31:54,816 --> 02:31:56,648
See Pawan.

2078
02:32:04,025 --> 02:32:05,483
Pawan!

2079
02:32:30,941 --> 02:32:54,148
Un... cle!

2080
02:32:57,441 --> 02:33:05,398

Jai Shree Ram!
