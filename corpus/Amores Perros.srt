1
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:10,235
Love's A Bitch

2
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,910
What did you do?

3
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,205
- What did you...?
- Nothing!

4
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,664
Nothing? Bullshit!

5
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,585
Fuck, he's bleeding to death.

6
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,421
They still coming?

7
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,926
- They still behind us?
- I can't see them.

8
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,595
Shit, he's bleeding a lot.

9
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,264
- Stop the bleeding.
- I can't.

10
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,683
- Use your finger.
- There's too much.

11
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,854
Here come those bastards. Faster!

12
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,815
Fuck!

13
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,066
Faster!

14
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,028
Motherfuckers!

15
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,160
- Fucking hell!
- Watch out!

16
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,089
- Shit, he fell.
- Is he dead?

17
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,509
Why did you fuck
with those bastards?

18
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,678
Is he dead?

19
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,054
Answer me!

20
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,684
No, but he keeps falling.
He's bleeding even more!

21
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,981
I've covered his wound.

22
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,941
Get down!

23
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,319
They've got a fucking gun!

24
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,255
Hurry! Let's go to Chilaquil's.

25
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,927
Motherfucker!

26
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,099
- Faster.
- Get down, man.

27
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,148
Step on it!

28
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,748
The window! The window, that's it!

29
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:35,714
Octavio and Susana

30
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,277
Are you ready?

31
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,155
What's your stake?

32
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,407
Ten thousand.

33
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,535
OK for 10,000?

34
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,621
Go on then.

35
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,832
You're on for 10.

36
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,585
10's the stake.

37
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,431
Heat 'em up!

38
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,067
Marks!

39
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,864
Let them go!

40
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,421
Cofi!

41
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,965
Cofi, come here!

42
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,388
Fucking dog!

43
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,612
Hello, senora.

44
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,365
How's he been?

45
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,743
Better. The fever broke.

46
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,332
Susana, I can't watch him tomorrow.

47
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,875
Why?

48
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,755
I have to help my sister move,

49
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,340
and go to the market.

50
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,508
Senora, give me a break!

51
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,887
I have a match final. I'll iron tonight.

52
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,305
No.

53
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,390
Leave the kid with your mother.

54
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,142
My mother?

55
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,729
Just this week. Then I'll work it out.

56
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,273
No.

57
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,859
I raised my children,

58
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,695
now you raise yours.

59
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,355
Go on, Turco!

60
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,860
Get him, eat him!

61
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,071
Do I stop it? He'll kill him.

62
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,659
It's cool. He's back on top.

63
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,827
Kill him!

64
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,092
- What's up, Ma?
- Sit down and eat.

65
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,928
How's it going, little dude?

66
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,223
- How's he doing?
- Better.

67
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,064
Thank you.

68
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,983
Know what?
A baby born in Guadalajara

69
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,444
gets a finger up his ass.

70
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,697
- Why?
- To see what he'll be.

71
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,408
If he kicks,
he'll be a soccer player.

72
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,660
If he screams, a mariachi.

73
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,913
And if he laughs, he'll be a homo.

74
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,667
What about girls?

75
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,503
We finger them until they're 18.

76
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,674
Stop bullshitting, Octavio.

77
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,593
Susana?

78
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,556
Susana? Did you bleach my uniform?

79
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,517
Look at it!

80
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,399
And Cofi?

81
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,277
Where is that fucking dog?

82
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,614
- No "hello"...?
- Where?

83
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,325
- I don't know.
- Sit and eat.

84
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,036
You let him out again, right, bitch?

85
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,332
I always tell you to watch it
when you go out!

86
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,418
- Lay off!
- Who asked you?

87
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,631
You don't care about that dog.
I feed it.

88
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,509
This is between me and my wife.

89
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,512
I'm the one who let him go,
so lay off her.

90
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,639
Keep out of it!

91
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,974
Shut up, please.

92
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,820
Here's your dough,
less 500 for my cut.

93
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,201
- Just luck, fatso.
- Cool.

94
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,621
- See you Saturday.
- OK.

95
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,250
What about your fucking dog?

96
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,835
Barbecue it if you'd like, shithead!

97
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,798
Champignon, move that dog!

98
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,100
Fucking dog can't get enough!

99
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,893
Give him to me.

100
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,729
He won't budge.

101
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,358
Sic him on those dogs.
That will cool him off.

102
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,862
Good idea.

103
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,535
It's in the bag.

104
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,747
- Hey, that's Octavio's dog.
- Exactly.

105
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,508
- Can I?
- Yes.

106
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,515
Thanks for earlier.

107
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,017
What?

108
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,437
That was cool, taking the blame.

109
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,486
What happened here?

110
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,405
It's nothing.

111
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,993
Did Ramiro do this to you?

112
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,247
Yes, but he didn't mean it.

113
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,959
Didn't mean it?

114
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,212
You know what he's like.

115
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,593
Why do you put up with it?
He treats you like shit.

116
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,307
Not always.

117
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,937
Are you stupid
or just pretending?

118
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,263
Someone's here for you.

119
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,727
- Hang on.
- Uh-huh.

120
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,525
You know Ramiro doesn't want
Susana in your room.

121
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,152
We were watching TV!

122
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,029
Your brother doesn't like it,
neither do I.

123
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,906
It's the last time, you hear me?

124
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,825
The last!

125
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,620
- What's up?
- You won't believe it.

126
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,832
- What?
- Your dog killed Jarocho's Pancho.

127
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,417
What happened?

128
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,961
Jarocho sicced Pancho on Cofi,

129
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,546
but Cofi saw him coming.

130
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,175
He snapped his neck
and killed him.

131
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,594
- Where's Cofi?
- Here he comes.

132
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,929
Cofi! Here!

133
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,310
He's all right.

134
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,937
The other dogs didn't touch him.

135
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,235
What gives, Octavio?

136
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,030
Know what your dog did?

137
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,492
- Yeah.
- So?

138
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,911
It's OK, huh? It's cool.

139
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,704
Cool?

140
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,707
It's not cool at all.

141
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,168
Bring Pancho.

142
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,560
See what he did?

143
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,815
This dog was worth
at least 20,000 pesos.

144
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,903
Have him stuffed for your mantel.

145
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,198
Don't be a smartass, kiddo.

146
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,994
You have two choices.
Pay me, or pay me.

147
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,121
Why should I pay you?

148
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,958
Want to play with me? OK.

149
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,378
Wait! Why did you
set Pancho on him?

150
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,681
Listen,
give me your dog,

151
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,432
and I'll forget it.

152
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,394
You're nuts.

153
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,273
Start saving,

154
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,358
'cause you're gonna pay.

155
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,572
Make Ramiro pay if you're so cool.

156
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,741
Afraid he'll kick your ass again?

157
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,161
No way, asshole.

158
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,622
I'm not taking any more shit.

159
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,125
Got it, Octavio?

160
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,087
Let's go.

161
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,846
What's up?

162
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,061
Got a joint?

163
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,026
Ramiro, I need money.

164
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,321
Don't got any. Payday's Friday.

165
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,448
So what do I do?

166
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,451
The baby needs diapers
and formula,

167
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,162
and the eggs you eat aren't free.

168
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,539
- Got no money.
- "Got no money".

169
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,504
So you got no money?

170
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,089
Are you deaf?

171
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,384
Aren't drugstores good business?

172
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,013
Keep your mouth shut, or else.

173
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,518
Asshole!

174
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,813
One word and you're dead.

175
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,819
Being tough won't make you smart.

176
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,661
- Jimena took my headband.
- Give it back.

177
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,163
It's my headband!

178
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,040
No, it was a gift.

179
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,335
Liar, I bought it at the store.

180
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,296
Give it to her. You never wear it.

181
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,812
I'll get it!

182
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,483
Hello?

183
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,946
- Who was it?
- They hung up.

184
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,325
That mute man again?
Or that mute woman, maybe?

185
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,332
I'll get it.

186
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,004
Hello?

187
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,175
Hung up again.

188
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,552
Weird!

189
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,562
Can I come in?

190
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,481
What's up?

191
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,651
You going out?

192
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,321
Why?

193
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,281
No reason.

194
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,160
Something wrong?

195
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,745
I...

196
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,373
What happened?

197
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,918
I'm in trouble.
I don't know what to do.

198
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,590
I'm pregnant again.

199
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,345
Shit, Susana,
you want another baby already?

200
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,888
I didn't want it!

201
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,308
Ramiro is going to kill me.

202
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,523
No, he won't.

203
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,483
He went nuts once,

204
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,819
but he still married you, didn't he?

205
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,742
Yes, but I don't know
if I want to stay with him.

206
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,747
I can't have this baby, Octavio.

207
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,001
Are you thinking about an abortion?

208
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,504
Do you have a better idea?

209
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,673
What the fuck can I do?

210
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,886
Come away with me.

211
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,889
What?

212
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,474
Let's go away.

213
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,893
Far away.

214
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,770
I'm being serious!

215
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,147
So am I.

216
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,692
Don't talk shit.
Where would we go?

217
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,701
- What are you doing, you jerk?
- Come away with me.

218
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,672
- How many are they?
- Six bitches, three dicks.

219
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,215
- Ready?
- Wait.

220
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,093
That fat bitch is going in.
I smell cash.

221
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,597
Ever fucked a fatso like her?

222
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:46,392
- I have, it's hot.
- You have? Who?

223
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,021
Your mother, asshole.

224
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:54,775
Someday we'll do
that fucking bank, you'll see.

225
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,360
Keep cool, Tarzan.

226
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,280
We're going big time, man.

227
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,325
After that fucking bank,
I'm out of here.

228
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,493
It's not safe around here.

229
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,331
We're on, she's in.

230
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,890
Everyone down on the floor!

231
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,295
BUSINESSMAN MURDERED
MOTIVE UNKNOWN

232
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,376
MR. EZQUERRA'S WIDOW,
MRS. NORMA SAINZ, DIED

233
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,295
FUNERAL AT 10:30 A.M.

234
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,218
What's up?

235
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,555
Want some dinner?

236
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,557
Look what I brought you.

237
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,685
Cool!

238
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:38,189
No way! For me?

239
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,649
Like it?

240
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:44,111
Was a bitch to get it.

241
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,756
Shh!

242
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,970
Don't shout,
you'll wake the baby.

243
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,597
Hang on.

244
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,769
Baldy?

245
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,731
- Don't wake him.
- Why not?

246
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,567
It was hard to get him to sleep.

247
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,362
I never see him, do I, Baldy?

248
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,781
He's been puking all day.

249
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,325
He's sick.

250
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,411
Selfish bastard!

251
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:37,248
Shut the fuck up.
I gave you the Walkman!

252
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,585
I'm cool to you,
but you're always on my ass!

253
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,130
- The baby, shit!
- Shut up!

254
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,077
Wow, dude...
she's your brother's woman.

255
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,914
Yeah, but I always liked her,

256
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,916
even before they met.

257
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,919
But he got her first.

258
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,379
My ass!

259
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,965
Ramiro doesn't care about her.

260
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,385
But Susana does.
You're playing with fire, man.

261
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,139
I can't stop thinking about her.

262
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,893
There's thousands of bitches.
Why do you want to fuck her?

263
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,562
I don't want to fuck her!

264
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,689
I want her to leave with me.

265
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,734
Yeah? With what money?

266
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,365
You're going to fight him?

267
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,785
Where do we get the bet money?

268
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,125
- I'll pimp your sister.
- You asshole!

269
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,657
Who's there?

270
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,951
Phone call for Susana.

271
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,536
Who is it?

272
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,287
Her mother.

273
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,499
Tell her to fuck off.

274
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,668
She says it's urgent.

275
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:00,307
Hello?

276
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,603
Who was it?

277
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,774
Me.

278
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,985
You're nuts.

279
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,783
What's wrong with you?

280
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,161
Let go. Let go.

281
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,669
No, Octavio.

282
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,716
Not this way.

283
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,013
Then how?

284
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,981
This dog looks pretty sad to me.

285
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,859
But it killed Jarocho's dog.

286
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,069
You know this business?

287
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,739
More or less.

288
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,324
More or less?

289
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,077
- Sargento?
- Yes.

290
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,414
Sarge, take this dog.
Come with me.

291
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,341
This is my business.
Zero taxes,

292
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,843
zero strikes, zero unions.

293
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,680
Pure hard cash.

294
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,308
I take a loss now and then.

295
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,104
This is Mac, my best investment.

296
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,566
He's old, but he can still fight.

297
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,736
I got the van from his winnings.

298
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,696
We can be partners,

299
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,408
with your dog, and my stake money.

300
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:44,161
We'll split the profits 50-50.

301
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,788
What do you think?

302
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,458
- Sounds good.
- Good.

303
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,170
Good for eight fights,
then we'll see.

304
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,713
Fine.

305
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,549
But first, your dog
goes a round with Mac.

306
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,556
OK, it will cost you

307
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,402
Don't bullshit me.

308
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,445
What if your dog kills mine?

309
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,197
And what if mine dies?

310
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,325
But I don't have a van yet.

311
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,207
I'll give you 2,500.
Will that do?

312
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,211
Done.

313
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:45,264
Condom! Bring Mac.

314
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,812
Here's your take.

315
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,819
Release them on three. Count.

316
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,322
One...

317
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,742
two...

318
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,410
three!

319
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,754
That's enough.

320
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,464
Take your fucking dog.

321
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,883
Sarge!

322
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,595
Come back on Saturday at 12:00.

323
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,681
It's payback time for Jarocho.

324
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,445
- 20 is your change.
- Thank you.

325
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,200
Did you find everything you needed?

326
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,785
Except rubbers.

327
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,622
You don't have my size.

328
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,081
What the fuck are you doing here?

329
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,502
- Shopping.
- Where did you get the dough?

330
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,587
You don't have money, but I do.

331
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,172
Stick it up your ass.

332
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,217
I'll buy my family's things.

333
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,344
Ring me up, or I'll call the manager.

334
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,766
Asshole, get out or you're dead.

335
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,520
I'm not Susana, you know.
You don't scare me.

336
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,530
- What happened?
- Nothing, nothing.

337
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,908
Fucking hell!

338
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,661
Good afternoon.

339
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,927
- Take it.
- What for?

340
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,471
So you can take care of him.

341
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,307
And him.

342
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,872
Yes?

343
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,374
Hey, brother, how are you?

344
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,543
I'm very well.

345
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,378
No, not much.

346
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,548
Hang on.

347
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,008
I can't hear anything.

348
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,219
Neither can I. Why don't you leave?

349
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,106
What's up?

350
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,652
I couldn't get away.
Tomorrow, I promise.

351
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,072
I miss you, too.

352
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,703
Don't call here anymore,
Julieta's suspicious.

353
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:59,082
No, I'm not angry.

354
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,712
Tomorrow at 11:00.

355
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,631
I love you.

356
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,991
What's the matter?

357
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,534
Stop!

358
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,707
Stop, man!

359
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,835
Keep out of my business, asshole!

360
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,532
Here, pal, take this.

361
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,786
- What's up, fatso?
- Just hanging, Jarocho.

362
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,663
Why are you playing with girls?

363
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,373
Because they got mean dogs.

364
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,792
You're betting 15 on it?

365
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,711
My dog beats all of yours.

366
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,339
I'm talking to the ringmaster, princess.

367
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,465
So...

368
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,093
- 15?
- Make it 10.

369
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,886
OK.

370
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,890
Place your bets, senores.

371
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,696
Waste him!

372
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,243
Kill him!

373
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,460
Ready?

374
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,631
Let them go!

375
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,976
I'll catch up.

376
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,664
What are you doing here?

377
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,749
Taking a stroll.

378
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,335
Stroll elsewhere.

379
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,214
Don't mess with us,
and especially not her.

380
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,134
It's a free country, isn't it?

381
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,056
To her, you're dead.
Don't forget that.

382
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,434
You're hostile, sister-in-law!

383
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,659
That's two you owe me.

384
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:06,121
Don't be pissed, Jarochito.
Win some, lose some.

385
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,648
What's up?

386
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,027
Here.

387
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,486
It's yours.

388
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,531
But hide it, or my brother
will take it.

389
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,700
Don't worry.

390
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,118
Got another place to stash it?

391
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:49,623
Yes. I put that other money
in a case in the closet.

392
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,084
Shh!

393
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,545
The baby's sleeping!

394
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,844
This will be our bank, OK?

395
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,512
Just yours and mine.

396
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,932
Octavio, you stealing too?

397
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,683
No.

398
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:12,103
This money's clean,
so you'll come away with me.

399
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,105
Come away with you?

400
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,698
You still don't get it, do you?

401
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,117
No, you don't get it.

402
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,788
Jorge has cousins in Juarez.
We'll go there.

403
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,375
We can open a store, we got cash.

404
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,709
It'll be cool.

405
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,169
No.

406
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,799
I don't want any more trouble.
Can't you understand?

407
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,435
Understand?

408
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,442
Come away with me.

409
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,180
Open the register, motherfucker!

410
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,182
Open it!

411
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,688
Open the register!

412
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,403
I didn't say you could come in.

413
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,655
What are you watching?

414
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,699
None of your business.

415
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,744
Change that shit. I don't like it.

416
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,455
What do you want?

417
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,208
I heard you're getting rich
with my dog.

418
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,168
Your car is nice.

419
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,753
Your dog?

420
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,797
He's mine.

421
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,591
Don't talk shit, little brother!

422
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:32,804
He's as much mine as yours,
so I get half of the winnings.

423
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,723
Anyway, look at him.

424
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,852
Doesn't look like
you care about him much.

425
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,396
I care more than you know.

426
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,732
Give you money?
I'm not giving you shit.

427
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,735
It's simple...

428
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:52,031
cough it up, or I'll blow
your piggy bank away.

429
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,746
Next time's for real,

430
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,916
so you better get me my dough.

431
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,753
"The cock crows..."

432
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,799
What's up, Baldy?
Look what I got you!

433
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,682
Look at all this!

434
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,977
Your mom's going to put it away.

435
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,982
We're millionaires!

436
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:11,194
There's enough to live on
for two years.

437
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,738
Come live with me.

438
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,573
What do you say, eh?

439
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,870
- Why, Octavio?
- Why what?

440
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,081
Why do you want
to live with me?

441
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,298
You still don't get it?

442
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,801
No, I do get it.

443
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,516
Give Jorge something to eat.

444
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,648
I've got some business for you.

445
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,025
Jarocho's got a class A dog.

446
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,568
He wants to fight Cofi.

447
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,112
Yeah, right!

448
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,740
He'll bet 40,000.

449
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,700
Forty?

450
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,910
You in?

451
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,788
That's too much for me.

452
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,457
You're on your own.

453
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,710
What about our deal?

454
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,713
The deal was for eight fights.
We've done 15.

455
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,840
That's enough.

456
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,259
You won, I won, that's it. OK?

457
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,761
OK.

458
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,097
When does he want to fight?

459
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,017
This Saturday.

460
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,436
He wants it private, at Trujillo's.

461
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,856
No outside bets, just you and him.

462
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:56,818
All right.

463
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,696
Do I confirm?

464
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,322
OK.

465
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,161
Hey, fatso,

466
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,205
I need you to do me a big favour.

467
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,971
How's the baby?

468
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,683
Good. Growing, I guess.

469
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,476
Got a name yet?

470
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,357
if it's a girl, Susana.

471
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,485
And if it's a boy?

472
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,531
Octavio?

473
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,002
Everything's ready.
We leave Sunday.

474
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,381
But I'm going to need
some of the money.

475
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,218
Saturday's the big one.

476
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,222
Don't fight him anymore.

477
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,933
We've got enough.

478
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,518
One last one?

479
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,651
What time is the bus to Juarez?

480
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,364
It leaves at 12:00.

481
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,658
Ramiro will still be at work.

482
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,497
Don't worry about Ramiro.

483
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,502
He won't fuck with us anymore,
I'm sure.

484
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,512
Are you scared?

485
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,515
It's heavy shit.

486
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,145
Scared?

487
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,248
Ma?

488
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,759
So this is how
you take care of the kid?

489
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,273
Shh!
What's wrong?

490
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,484
Now you can stay drunk.

491
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:18,931
What's up, Ma?

492
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,976
Do you know what happened
to your brother?

493
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,437
He didn't come home
last night.

494
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,063
No idea.

495
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,691
You don't know?

496
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,944
He got beat up bad.

497
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,656
He must have pissed off
a customer.

498
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,244
They threatened to kill him.

499
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,913
God knows what he's up to!

500
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,419
He left with the baby and Susana.

501
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,925
- Where to?
- I don't know where.

502
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,345
Or if they'll be back.

503
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,600
What?

504
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,493
Goddamn it!

505
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,290
Motherfucker! And that bitch!

506
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,078
People Today

507
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:12,211
With us today, someone
no man would want to miss...

508
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:17,216
one of the most beautiful
women in Iberian America,

509
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,844
Valeria Amaya!

510
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,349
Thank you so much.

511
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,104
I have to find her, damn it!

512
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,774
She tricked you. I warned you.

513
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,777
It wasn't her.
It was Ramiro, that asshole.

514
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,285
This is your year.

515
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,579
You represent "Enchant"
in Latin America,

516
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,123
loads of models envy you...

517
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,419
I'll find her!

518
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,087
How much you got?

519
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,631
- 7,000, and you?
- 10,000.

520
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,593
I hope Jarocho
will go with that.

521
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,679
I've got 3,000 at home,
I'll loan them to you.

522
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,974
That woman's hot!

523
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,645
Is it true
you have a new love?

524
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,273
Yes, it's not just a rumour.

525
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:17,401
In fact, he's here.

526
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:21,780
- My love!
- Andres Salgado, no less!

527
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,750
Please, have a seat.

528
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,922
What a lucky guy!

529
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,591
Let's go.

530
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,178
Let's go. Cofi!

531
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:53,395
OK, one more
personal question.

532
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,273
Will you two get married?

533
00:53:56,399 --> 00:54:00,361
Not right away,
but we have a son...

534
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,030
and I brought him.

535
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,659
Richie!

536
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,953
Isn't he cute!

537
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,998
He looks just like Andres!

538
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,626
He's got my white hair.

539
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:33,435
What's up?
You didn't back out?

540
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:36,397
- As you can see.
- You get the 40,000?

541
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,193
- I only got 20,000.
- Will that do?

542
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:46,907
You're on.
Playing for candy!

543
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,245
Sargento, put the dogs in the pool.

544
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,790
Ready!

545
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,710
On your marks!

546
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,173
Release them!

547
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,862
You crazy fucker!

548
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,447
Fight's over!

549
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,450
He was winning!
Why did you shoot?

550
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,745
- It just went off.
- What's this shit?

551
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,830
It's between you and him.

552
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,458
Here's your money. And yours.

553
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,543
This isn't fair, Mauricio!

554
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,462
Work it out between you.

555
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:45,507
Don't be cry-babies.
That's the business.

556
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,801
You better scram,

557
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:51,305
before things heat up.

558
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:55,017
Complain to your brother.
I'll be waiting for him!

559
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,705
- Where are you going?
- Start the car, wait for me.

560
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,056
Forget something, princess?

561
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,337
What did you do?

562
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,381
- What did you...
- Nothing!

563
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,258
Nothing? Bullshit!

564
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,515
- Is he dead?
- No!

565
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,691
Why did you fuck
with those bastards?

566
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,573
Assholes!

567
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:49,798
Thanks to Valeria Amaya
and Andres Salgado

568
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,301
for being on the show.

569
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,804
Friends, stay with us
for more surprises

570
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,015
on "People Today".

571
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:05,606
Valeria, I thought
you were with someone else.

572
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,317
Well, now you know.

573
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,943
So many rumours.

574
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:14,239
- People love gossip.
- Laura, 20 seconds!

575
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,783
Right, goodbye.

576
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,912
- What are you doing now?
- Nothing, why?

577
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,413
Have lunch with me.

578
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,749
No thanks, Andres.

579
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:30,756
You would say no
to Andres Salgado?

580
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:34,801
Listen, the show's over.
The show is over.

581
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,763
I have a surprise you'll love.

582
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,227
OK, let's go.

583
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,778
- Where are you going?
- To the restaurant.

584
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:56,240
I said lunch,
I didn't say where.

585
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,208
- Come in.
- Did you buy this place?

586
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:09,628
- Not exactly.
- It's lovely!

587
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,382
- You like it?
- Of course!

588
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,093
This couch is just like mine.

589
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,679
It's not like yours.

590
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,514
It is yours.

591
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,808
In the bedroom,
you'll find your clothes,

592
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,893
your perfumes...

593
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,981
What are you playing at?

594
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,818
That's not all.
Look at the view!

595
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,115
You like it?

596
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:42,202
- You've gone too far. I'm going.
- Wait!

597
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,914
Take the keys to your apartment.

598
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,333
What do you mean, my apartment?

599
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,878
That's right, you're home!

600
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,674
Idiots!

601
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,801
Darling!

602
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,513
What's this hole?

603
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:05,100
I had enough to buy it,
but not to fix it.

604
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:07,603
OK, enough!

605
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:11,398
- You're jealous.
- Thanks!

606
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,358
I've never seen you
acting so well.

607
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,444
You liked it?

608
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:19,072
- I love you, too.
- Sorry.

609
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,241
I was joking.

610
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,826
Bye!

611
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,286
Wow!

612
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,121
Thanks.

613
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:30,042
Thanks for the magazine cover.

614
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,835
Good luck, matador.

615
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,675
My love, is it really true?

616
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,428
- Honey?
- What?

617
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,805
I spoke with Julieta.

618
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,224
And?

619
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,435
As of today, we're separated.

620
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:52,773
For good? You're not lying to me?

621
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,150
Starting tonight,
we can sleep together.

622
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,861
Are you sure about this?

623
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,571
I am.
Have you changed your mind?

624
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:02,616
I just can't believe it!

625
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,236
- Darling?
- Yes?

626
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,779
What shall we toast with?

627
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:47,411
Ah, I knew
I forgot something.

628
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,746
Please,
keep an eye on the food.

629
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,958
You know I can't fry an egg.

630
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,210
You're my special guest!

631
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,212
A guest in my own home?

632
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,967
You are the guest.
Stay here.

633
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,301
Darling...

634
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,765
- Come over here.
- Hurry back.

635
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,976
You bet I will.

636
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,387
Richie! Shut up!
What's the matter?

637
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:19,294
Daniel And Valeria

638
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,228
Excuse us.

639
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,813
So?

640
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:40,607
It's hard to diagnose...

641
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,984
massive blood loss,

642
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:46,071
double fractured tibia and fibula,

643
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:49,324
open fractured femur...

644
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:53,286
the femoral biceps are
almost completely severed.

645
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:57,207
- It's a miracle she's alive.
- Will she make it?

646
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,125
I hope so.

647
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,961
When can I see her?

648
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,671
I don't know...

649
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:06,341
in two days,
depending on how she recovers.

650
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:10,387
Is there a relative I should notify?

651
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,723
Her family's in Spain.
I don't know if I should tell them.

652
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,310
Will you take the responsibility?

653
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,357
- Thanks, Nacho.
- No problem.

654
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:24,526
My regards to Julieta.

655
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,945
Sorry, it's habit.

656
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,697
Kiss your girls for me.

657
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,657
No problem.

658
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,415
One, two, three.

659
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,298
Don't tire her out.

660
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,008
No.

661
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,472
I'll never play soccer again.

662
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,644
Shh! Take it easy.

663
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:02,939
And Richie?

664
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,983
He's fine, he's at home.

665
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:12,657
Our home...

666
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:17,245
- Daniel...
- Huh?

667
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:19,497
Don't tell my father.

668
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,168
- Isn't it time you spoke to him?
- I don't want to.

669
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,378
He'd say I deserved it.

670
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,634
OK. Don't worry.

671
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,512
Sleep...

672
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,473
sleep.

673
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,683
I'm here with you.

674
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,940
- Daniel?
- Huh?

675
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,900
Are you awake?

676
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,986
What is it?

677
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,030
Daniel, I'm scared.

678
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,284
Look at me!

679
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,037
Don't worry, they'll take it off.

680
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:01,623
You've been very brave.

681
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:06,252
The truth is...

682
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,380
I'm scared to death.

683
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:13,051
You'll be fine, you'll see.

684
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,521
Richie, look!
Look who's here!

685
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,941
Your mommy is back.

686
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:31,569
I missed you,
my little one.

687
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,826
What did you do without me?

688
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,457
My love!

689
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,043
Welcome home, my love!

690
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:53,800
The first one to blink loses, eh?

691
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:08,857
No!

692
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,738
You lose, you lose!

693
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,708
What are you doing?

694
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,710
I'm examining you.

695
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,465
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

696
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,133
I can't.

697
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:38,470
Yes, you can.

698
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,680
Let's see how you do it.

699
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,024
Sure you'll be all right?

700
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,069
Sure. I'm an expert.

701
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,946
Left... right...

702
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:00,283
What if you need something?

703
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,787
I've got Richie, don't I?

704
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:09,417
Whatever you do, stay seated.

705
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:13,838
- Even if the earth quakes?
- Let it crumble.

706
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:16,758
But you don't leave that chair!

707
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,344
- I'll be back by 8:00.
- I'll be here.

708
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,097
- Good luck.
- I'll miss you.

709
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,142
Fetch, sweetheart.

710
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:34,062
Good. Bring it back.

711
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,987
Good, Richie.
You're a good boy.

712
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:45,406
Bring me the ball.

713
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,579
Run, run!
No, Richie!

714
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,501
Shit! Richie!

715
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,963
Richie, good boy!

716
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,724
Mommy's here!

717
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,818
It's me!

718
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,196
I'm in the kitchen.

719
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:26,698
How did it go?

720
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:29,993
From the doctor,
so I don't have to carry you.

721
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:35,790
- How's my princess?
- Richie went into the hole.

722
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,669
- How?
- He was running after the ball.

723
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,672
He'll get out.

724
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,674
That was five hours ago.

725
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:50,013
What can we do?

726
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,852
- I know!
- What are you doing?

727
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,645
Chocolates.

728
01:11:57,771 --> 01:12:00,732
He'll come right out.

729
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:02,817
Wait, I'm coming with you.

730
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:07,697
Here, try the crutches.

731
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,033
Why won't he come out?

732
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,827
He must be stuck down there.

733
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:16,748
Don't worry about it, he'll come out.

734
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,336
I tried that.

735
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,713
I hear noises,
but he won't come out.

736
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:28,468
Don't worry, he'll come out.

737
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:32,555
You want an omelette? I'm hungry.

738
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:36,100
He's all right.
A bit disoriented, but he's here,

739
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:37,685
not stolen, not lost.

740
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:40,396
He's here with us, OK?

741
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:51,115
Daniel...

742
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:53,785
- Daniel?
- What?

743
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,828
Listen, it's Richie.

744
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,841
Yes, it's him.

745
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:13,096
- So?
- Wait.

746
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,035
- Richie?
- Daniel?

747
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:39,038
- What?
- Hurry, I think I heard him.

748
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,502
- Where is he?
- Help me.

749
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:46,754
Careful.

750
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:53,553
He's under the living room.

751
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:58,683
Richie, darling...

752
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:19,912
Oh, shit!

753
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,123
That scared me!

754
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:28,254
Hello?

755
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:36,512
- Who was it?
- I don't know. They hung up.

756
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,871
Manuel, bastard!

757
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:05,791
- Where have you been?
- Working, dear. How are you?

758
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:09,754
- I'm getting there.
- Take it easy, huh?

759
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,924
In a month, if all goes well,

760
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,926
I'll be back
on the Enchant campaign.

761
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:17,595
Enchant? Forget about that.

762
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:18,804
What do you mean?

763
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,599
Listen, the contract
with Enchant is finished.

764
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,228
- They pulled out?
- What did you expect?

765
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,772
They hired you when you were well.

766
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:29,982
Be realistic, you're not well.

767
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:32,693
When you get well, like before,

768
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:36,113
we'll contact Enchant and it'll be fine...

769
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,103
Jesus, Richie! Shit!

770
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,655
Son of a bitch!

771
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,118
Fuck you, Richie!

772
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,550
My darling? Richie?

773
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:52,064
The title goes higher,

774
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,233
and the photo to the left.

775
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,820
- Like that?
- A bit more.

776
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:00,990
Or raise the photo
and bring the text down?

777
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,784
No, that breaks the harmony.

778
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,787
Mr. Estrada, telephone.

779
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:09,749
Tell them I'll call back later.

780
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,710
It seems urgent.
I think it's your wife.

781
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,047
Excuse me.

782
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,970
Julieta, what's the matter?

783
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:24,555
Julieta, answer me.

784
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:27,016
I'm not Julieta.

785
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:30,102
Darling! I'm sorry, my secretary...

786
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:32,021
What would you say to Julieta?

787
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:35,941
- Nothing, it was a mistake.
- What would you say?

788
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,903
- I swear.
- Well?

789
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:41,697
This isn't like you. What's wrong?

790
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:48,704
Valeria? My love?

791
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,832
The rats ate Richie.

792
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:55,961
What rats?

793
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,590
What happened, honey?

794
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:04,720
There are thousands
of rats down there.

795
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,058
How do you know?

796
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:12,853
I saw them. I'm sure they ate Richie.

797
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:15,523
Don't worry.

798
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:17,858
Rats don't eat dogs.

799
01:18:17,984 --> 01:18:20,111
They would get bitten.

800
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,029
But there are thousands of them.

801
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:28,119
We could put out some rat poison.

802
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:30,871
Richie would eat it.

803
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:34,625
We could send a cat down.

804
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,544
A cat would fight with Richie.

805
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,796
So what the fuck do we do?

806
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:51,225
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry.

807
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:58,315
- Everything will be fine.
- You're not in my position.

808
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:03,195
Look at my leg,
it'll be covered with scars.

809
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:05,656
Plastic surgery has come a long way.

810
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:08,200
You'll hardly see any scars...

811
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:10,411
Don't fucking touch me!

812
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:23,549
It's Richie!

813
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,597
- Richie!
- He heard you shouting.

814
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:32,475
It's him!

815
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,818
- I know!
- Where are you going?

816
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:48,032
If I make it bigger, he'll come out.

817
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:50,326
The rats will come out!

818
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:51,911
They didn't come out before,

819
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,705
I don't know
why they'd come out now.

820
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:57,708
Make the hole as big as you can.

821
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:00,252
Shit! Richie!

822
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:08,093
Hello?

823
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:13,098
Who's there?
Fuck your mother!

824
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:19,021
Who was that, Daniel?

825
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,982
No idea.

826
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:26,195
When I used to call,
you knew it was me.

827
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,239
So who is it?

828
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:30,658
I don't know, OK?

829
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:04,400
Valeria, what's the matter?

830
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:08,070
My leg really hurts.

831
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:11,574
- I can't stand it.
- We're going to the hospital.

832
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,701
No, I talked to the doctor.

833
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:18,414
He said it's normal for it to hurt.

834
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,667
But it feels like it's going to burst.

835
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,796
Did he prescribe anything?

836
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:29,258
Tranquilizers
and an anti-inflammatory.

837
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,511
What can I do?

838
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,514
Hold me.

839
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:27,566
SEE YOU SOON

840
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:03,602
I'm going to squeeze a little.

841
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:13,821
- Did you walk on it?
- A little.

842
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:30,254
Got the X-rays?

843
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:42,349
Well...

844
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:46,103
You can get dressed, Valeria.

845
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:48,605
Margarita, help her.

846
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:50,649
Come, there's no room here.

847
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:59,950
Want to order take-out,
or rent a movie?

848
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:03,746
I'm not in the mood.
I feel lousy.

849
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:05,664
You're going to be fine.

850
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,752
Goddamn it!
Is that all you can say?

851
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,479
Daniel...

852
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,691
It's Richie!

853
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:34,610
He's whining, listen.

854
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:37,905
Listen, it's him!

855
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:40,741
Get him out.

856
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:44,870
- How?
- Tear up the floor or something!

857
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:48,791
I can't tear it up.
I don't have the money to fix it...

858
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,834
Money doesn't matter!

859
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,253
It does right now.

860
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:55,464
- Get him out!
- He can get himself out!

861
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:58,842
You faggot!
You've always been selfish!

862
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:01,428
I gave up everything for you!

863
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:05,099
Yeah, your bitchy wife
and your stupid daughters!

864
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:07,017
Shut up or I'll hit you!

865
01:25:07,143 --> 01:25:10,854
- You piece of shit!
- Go fuck yourself!

866
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,898
You and that stupid dog!

867
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:15,692
You fucking asshole,
drop dead!

868
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:17,945
Drop dead, fucker!

869
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,613
Fucker!

870
01:26:01,614 --> 01:26:04,324
I'll be back around 2:00.

871
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,743
I don't care
if you never come back.

872
01:26:39,986 --> 01:26:45,532
Hello?

873
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:51,288
Daniel?

874
01:26:54,375 --> 01:27:00,255
Sweetheart?

875
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:29,034
Valeria, open the door.

876
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,411
Open up, damn it!

877
01:27:31,537 --> 01:27:34,164
Valeria, open up!

878
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:36,375
Open up, Valeria!

879
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:15,747
Valeria, please.

880
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:19,710
I have nothing to apologize for,
but all right, I'm sorry.

881
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:22,462
OK now?

882
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:27,634
Valeria, open up or I'll do it myself.

883
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:32,848
On the count of three,
I'm breaking it down.

884
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:37,728
One...

885
01:28:38,604 --> 01:28:40,022
two...

886
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:43,483
two and a quarter...

887
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:47,029
two and a half...

888
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,532
two and three-quarters...

889
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:53,410
Shit!

890
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,500
Valeria.

891
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:02,461
What happened, honey?

892
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,171
Valeria.

893
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:11,595
Valeria, don't do this to me, please!

894
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:16,767
We have to...

895
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,249
How is she?

896
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:46,421
She had severe arterial thrombosis,
which affected the tissues.

897
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:50,801
We should have intervened earlier.

898
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:52,344
There is a lot of damage.

899
01:29:53,429 --> 01:29:56,014
No blood could get to the muscles.

900
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:57,474
And?

901
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,769
Advanced gangrene set in...

902
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:04,481
and I had to amputate the leg.

903
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,195
I'm sorry, Daniel.

904
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:24,436
Shit!

905
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:56,671
SPACE AVAILABLE

906
01:34:15,858 --> 01:34:21,237
El Chivo And Maru

907
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:29,704
Hello?

908
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,164
Yes.

909
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,085
Tell him 3:00.

910
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:36,961
Cancel the other one.

911
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:43,093
When we get to the house,
turn that shit off.

912
01:34:43,219 --> 01:34:44,928
He hates that crap.

913
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,100
Why do we need 40 sandwiches?

914
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:52,727
It's a gift for a friend, OK?

915
01:34:55,606 --> 01:34:57,857
Sure your friend will do a good job?

916
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:00,777
I told you 20 times he will.

917
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:06,574
Who is this friend?
Is he a cop too?

918
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:09,244
No, he was locked up
for 20 years.

919
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:12,038
What for?

920
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:13,123
He was a guerrilla.

921
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:15,625
Like the Zapatistas?

922
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:21,506
That's right,
only he was a real son of a bitch.

923
01:35:21,632 --> 01:35:23,675
He planted a bomb in a mall,

924
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:25,218
kidnapped a banker,

925
01:35:25,344 --> 01:35:26,678
killed cops...

926
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,263
Turn here.

927
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:32,142
He had an army after him,
the White Brigade.

928
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:34,644
You know who got him?

929
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:37,272
- Who?
- Me!

930
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:42,694
I caught him pissing
at Sanborn's Cafe!

931
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,657
Can you believe that?

932
01:35:47,783 --> 01:35:49,159
Hello?

933
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:51,286
No.

934
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:55,248
Deposit that money in my account.

935
01:35:57,668 --> 01:36:00,128
I'll transfer it. Bye.

936
01:36:04,216 --> 01:36:06,176
What do I say to him?

937
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:08,511
Nothing. I'll do the talking.

938
01:36:08,637 --> 01:36:11,055
Don't ask personal questions.

939
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:12,432
Why not?

940
01:36:12,558 --> 01:36:14,017
It pisses him off.

941
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:16,853
He was a normal guy,
like you and me.

942
01:36:18,981 --> 01:36:22,692
He was a college teacher,
and one day, boom!

943
01:36:22,818 --> 01:36:25,904
He dumps his wife and daughter
and becomes a guerrilla.

944
01:36:27,072 --> 01:36:29,157
- And his family?
- What do you think?

945
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:30,909
They told him to go to hell!

946
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,410
His wife remarried.

947
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:34,913
I guess his daughter
thinks he's dead.

948
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:39,334
When he got out of the can,
he went fucking nuts.

949
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,880
When I found him, he was a wino.

950
01:36:44,006 --> 01:36:45,381
I felt sorry for him.

951
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:48,134
I gave him some cash
and a place to live.

952
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:51,638
We even became pals.
He started doing jobs for me.

953
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:56,434
Jobs... like this one?

954
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,186
Yeah.

955
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:01,981
I'll get it.

956
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:07,320
Why did you do that?

957
01:37:07,446 --> 01:37:08,947
You'll buy another one!

958
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:30,093
What's up, Chivito?

959
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:32,303
What's up, Leonardo?

960
01:37:33,472 --> 01:37:34,889
You all right?

961
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:38,184
Meet my friend, Gustavo Garfias.

962
01:37:40,604 --> 01:37:43,273
- Hello, brother.
- Pleased to meet you.

963
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,067
This is for you.

964
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:50,113
Great!

965
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,241
Cool.

966
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:11,342
No chilli, no onion. Perfect!

967
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:13,803
Thanks.

968
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:17,974
Sit there.

969
01:38:22,688 --> 01:38:25,481
Did you lose your glasses?

970
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:28,526
I stopped using them.

971
01:38:28,652 --> 01:38:30,653
If God wants me to see blurry,

972
01:38:30,779 --> 01:38:32,322
I'll see blurry.

973
01:38:36,785 --> 01:38:38,661
My friend Gustavo needs a favour.

974
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:41,456
The photograph.

975
01:38:45,544 --> 01:38:47,795
I don't do that anymore.

976
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,672
I told you last time.

977
01:38:50,633 --> 01:38:52,091
Come on.

978
01:38:52,217 --> 01:38:54,260
How are you going to live?
On trash?

979
01:38:55,888 --> 01:38:58,348
Trash provides, Leonardo.

980
01:38:58,474 --> 01:38:59,682
Really.

981
01:38:59,808 --> 01:39:02,518
Look, a Citizen.

982
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:06,564
I found it in the dumpster.
This, too.

983
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:09,192
Don't bullshit me.

984
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:11,611
You stole it!

985
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:13,237
No, I found it.

986
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:16,741
The Commander says
you are very good.

987
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:22,497
Good at what?

988
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:27,043
Come on, take it. Don't fuck around.

989
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:33,007
Who is he?

990
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,138
My partner.

991
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:41,265
What did he do?

992
01:39:42,851 --> 01:39:44,268
He's cheating me.

993
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:47,730
How much are you paying?

994
01:39:47,856 --> 01:39:51,275
50,000 now, 50,000 after.

995
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,405
100 now,

996
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:56,948
50 after.

997
01:39:57,825 --> 01:39:59,409
Done?

998
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:02,537
OK, but I only have 50 on me.

999
01:40:09,294 --> 01:40:12,463
- His name?
- Luis Miranda Solares.

1000
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:15,258
He lives at 1460 Sierra de Maika.

1001
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:17,343
He works on Montes Urales Street.

1002
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:21,431
Real blue collar, huh!

1003
01:40:29,356 --> 01:40:30,398
All right.

1004
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:37,864
Make it look like a robbery.

1005
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:40,074
No people, no trouble...

1006
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,951
Of course, brother.

1007
01:40:42,077 --> 01:40:44,787
No people, no trouble, no shit.

1008
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:40,291
Richie!
What's the matter?

1009
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:17,161
Help me, shit!
Help me!

1010
01:46:17,287 --> 01:46:18,454
The door's stuck.

1011
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:21,207
I've got a machete in my cart.

1012
01:46:26,296 --> 01:46:27,463
Call an ambulance!

1013
01:46:30,092 --> 01:46:31,926
Hang on.

1014
01:46:34,638 --> 01:46:37,223
Stay calm, stay calm.

1015
01:46:41,728 --> 01:46:43,062
Move aside.

1016
01:46:43,814 --> 01:46:45,648
- What is it?
- His foot is stuck.

1017
01:46:47,734 --> 01:46:49,610
Calm down!

1018
01:46:50,695 --> 01:46:54,240
Calm down!
Careful with his leg.

1019
01:46:54,366 --> 01:46:55,783
Keep still, kid!

1020
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:04,375
The other kid?

1021
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:11,257
He's dead already!

1022
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:16,971
An ambulance! Christ!

1023
01:47:29,484 --> 01:47:32,027
Calm down, you'll be right out.

1024
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:36,407
Open the window.
Try to open it!

1025
01:47:36,533 --> 01:47:37,992
They're here.

1026
01:47:42,038 --> 01:47:44,457
Keep away!
Let him breathe!

1027
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:46,542
Can you hear me?

1028
01:47:46,668 --> 01:47:48,127
The window!

1029
01:47:48,253 --> 01:47:49,462
There!

1030
01:47:49,588 --> 01:47:52,047
Help me, please!

1031
01:47:52,174 --> 01:47:53,883
Lower!

1032
01:47:54,968 --> 01:47:57,720
What's your name?
Can you hear me?

1033
01:47:57,846 --> 01:48:00,890
We'll get you out.

1034
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:02,975
Her leg's stuck.

1035
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:35,216
Easy! Easy!

1036
01:48:54,986 --> 01:48:57,404
Hang in there, champ.

1037
01:49:05,747 --> 01:49:07,456
What did they do to you?

1038
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:10,668
Hang on, boy.

1039
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:15,756
Good, you're very brave.

1040
01:49:15,882 --> 01:49:18,092
That's it, champ!

1041
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:19,843
That's it, boy.

1042
01:50:49,809 --> 01:50:52,519
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Putting on my hood!

1043
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:56,315
Why not wear a sign saying
"Bank Robber"?

1044
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:58,317
For banks, you don't wear anything!

1045
01:50:58,443 --> 01:51:00,861
What? Just my stupid face?

1046
01:51:00,987 --> 01:51:02,780
You decide.

1047
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,455
Hit the floor, you motherfuckers!

1048
01:51:13,291 --> 01:51:15,459
This is a stickup!

1049
01:51:15,585 --> 01:51:17,628
This is a stickup, assholes!

1050
01:51:17,754 --> 01:51:19,713
Everyone on the floor!

1051
01:51:19,839 --> 01:51:21,382
What are you looking at?

1052
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:23,133
Right now!

1053
01:51:23,259 --> 01:51:24,968
On the floor!

1054
01:51:25,095 --> 01:51:26,470
You, too!

1055
01:51:26,596 --> 01:51:28,305
I'm talking to you!

1056
01:51:28,431 --> 01:51:31,642
- Give me your wallet!
- Take it yourself.

1057
01:51:31,768 --> 01:51:33,268
Don't look at me!

1058
01:51:39,317 --> 01:51:40,818
On the floor!

1059
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:49,743
Don't move, drop the gun!

1060
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:51,870
Get down!

1061
01:52:06,302 --> 01:52:07,678
Easy...

1062
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:31,368
Leave him alone.

1063
01:52:31,494 --> 01:52:33,078
Lobo, get lost.

1064
01:52:33,204 --> 01:52:35,622
Good boy.

1065
01:52:45,717 --> 01:52:48,385
Very good. It's healed.

1066
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:37,184
What brings you here, Leo?

1067
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:39,353
Just passing by.

1068
01:53:40,939 --> 01:53:44,024
You're taking your time.
It's been a week.

1069
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:45,776
It's not easy.

1070
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:47,611
It never is, is it?

1071
01:53:48,363 --> 01:53:50,948
Tell your friend to keep cool.

1072
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:53,617
It'll be done in two days.

1073
01:53:53,743 --> 01:53:56,912
I've got your word, Chivo?

1074
01:53:57,038 --> 01:53:58,539
I've got to go to the bank.

1075
01:56:47,417 --> 01:56:49,584
- I watched your car!
- Sure...

1076
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:53,088
I was leaning on the car.

1077
01:56:53,214 --> 01:56:56,216
No, he went to play soccer!

1078
01:56:57,677 --> 01:56:59,553
For both of you.

1079
01:57:26,539 --> 01:57:28,373
My condolences, Dona Concha.

1080
01:57:48,811 --> 01:57:50,103
Are you all right?

1081
01:57:53,232 --> 01:57:54,691
Not as bad as I was.

1082
01:57:59,697 --> 01:58:01,156
Why did you leave?

1083
01:58:02,658 --> 01:58:04,534
Now's not the time to talk about it.

1084
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:09,664
Then when?

1085
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:41,530
Ramiro was my husband, wasn't he?

1086
01:58:41,656 --> 01:58:43,740
And what about our plans?

1087
01:58:43,866 --> 01:58:45,325
Your plans.

1088
01:58:46,619 --> 01:58:48,370
My grandmother used to say,

1089
01:58:48,496 --> 01:58:51,665
"To make God laugh,
tell Him your plans".

1090
01:58:53,501 --> 01:58:55,168
- You wronged me, Susana.
- No.

1091
01:58:55,294 --> 01:58:59,631
No, Octavio. We were the ones
who cheated.

1092
01:58:59,757 --> 01:59:01,675
But not anymore.

1093
01:59:03,594 --> 01:59:04,970
Come away with me.

1094
01:59:06,097 --> 01:59:07,806
How dare you?

1095
01:59:08,808 --> 01:59:10,892
After everything that's happened?

1096
01:59:15,064 --> 01:59:17,983
- You still don't get it!
- Yes, I do.

1097
01:59:19,318 --> 01:59:22,487
God can laugh,
but I still have my plans.

1098
01:59:24,365 --> 01:59:26,700
Sunday at 11:00,
I leave for Ciudad Juarez.

1099
01:59:27,702 --> 01:59:30,370
You've really lost it! Look at you!

1100
01:59:30,496 --> 01:59:32,372
I don't give a fuck!

1101
01:59:35,126 --> 01:59:36,835
Now you know everything.

1102
01:59:38,921 --> 01:59:40,589
I'll wait for you.

1103
01:59:44,468 --> 01:59:46,553
You decide if you want to come.

1104
01:59:47,805 --> 01:59:49,598
Do you get me now?

1105
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:53,018
Ramiro...

1106
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:56,730
the baby's name will be Ramiro.

1107
02:00:17,293 --> 02:00:19,336
Feeling better?

1108
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:30,764
What happened to you?

1109
02:00:59,377 --> 02:01:01,711
Flor?

1110
02:01:05,216 --> 02:01:06,716
Don't die on me!

1111
02:01:06,842 --> 02:01:09,552
Answer me, baby!

1112
02:01:14,725 --> 02:01:16,685
Frijol?

1113
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:49,926
It's not right, asshole!

1114
02:02:10,656 --> 02:02:13,783
Gringuita? My baby?

1115
02:02:19,623 --> 02:02:21,166
Hang in there.

1116
02:05:43,452 --> 02:05:45,703
Look straight ahead of you.

1117
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:48,748
Don't look at me.

1118
02:05:48,874 --> 02:05:50,375
Open the door.

1119
02:05:50,501 --> 02:05:52,126
No stupid moves.

1120
02:05:52,711 --> 02:05:55,713
- Don't turn around.
- Stay cool.

1121
02:06:00,302 --> 02:06:01,761
Move aside.

1122
02:06:05,641 --> 02:06:07,016
Cuff your left hand.

1123
02:06:09,353 --> 02:06:10,937
The right one to the wheel.

1124
02:06:12,273 --> 02:06:14,899
Cuff it to the wheel, dickhead!

1125
02:06:18,445 --> 02:06:19,487
Start the car.

1126
02:06:26,161 --> 02:06:27,704
Let's go.

1127
02:06:32,084 --> 02:06:33,251
What is this?

1128
02:06:34,378 --> 02:06:35,628
Robbery or kidnapping?

1129
02:06:35,754 --> 02:06:37,839
Maybe the last day of your life.

1130
02:06:41,594 --> 02:06:43,469
I was paid to blow you away, brother.

1131
02:06:44,888 --> 02:06:46,514
How about that?

1132
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:56,107
Stand still. On your knees.

1133
02:06:57,985 --> 02:06:59,319
On the floor.

1134
02:06:59,445 --> 02:07:00,862
Your hand.

1135
02:07:03,282 --> 02:07:04,365
Sit.

1136
02:07:06,952 --> 02:07:08,578
Lean there. Your hand, I said.

1137
02:07:22,593 --> 02:07:23,926
Want a drink?

1138
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:26,262
I've got rum,

1139
02:07:26,388 --> 02:07:28,348
water...

1140
02:07:28,474 --> 02:07:29,974
or milk.

1141
02:07:34,647 --> 02:07:37,982
- What will you do to me?
- What do you want?

1142
02:07:38,108 --> 02:07:41,110
Rum, water or milk?

1143
02:07:42,446 --> 02:07:44,739
My question couldn't be clearer.

1144
02:07:45,866 --> 02:07:48,576
Look, asshole,

1145
02:07:48,702 --> 02:07:51,371
I'm offering you a drink.

1146
02:07:51,497 --> 02:07:53,790
If you had any sense,

1147
02:07:53,916 --> 02:07:56,209
even a little bit,

1148
02:07:56,335 --> 02:07:59,128
you'd realize
I'm not going to kill you

1149
02:07:59,254 --> 02:08:00,755
just now, dickhead.

1150
02:08:02,007 --> 02:08:04,384
Rum, water or milk?

1151
02:08:07,554 --> 02:08:08,888
Water.

1152
02:08:21,819 --> 02:08:23,319
Cheers!

1153
02:08:25,322 --> 02:08:26,656
How do I drink it?

1154
02:08:26,782 --> 02:08:29,617
I'll be the waiter,
but not your nanny.

1155
02:08:33,205 --> 02:08:35,456
Who paid you to kill me?

1156
02:08:35,582 --> 02:08:36,999
Can't you guess?

1157
02:08:37,126 --> 02:08:39,085
No.

1158
02:08:39,211 --> 02:08:44,507
What if I told you it was the chick
you fuck daily in that motel?

1159
02:08:46,802 --> 02:08:48,428
Marta?

1160
02:08:51,098 --> 02:08:52,390
No.

1161
02:08:53,559 --> 02:08:55,101
It can't be.

1162
02:08:55,227 --> 02:08:57,228
Right. Not her.

1163
02:08:58,731 --> 02:09:00,356
Your wife.

1164
02:09:05,195 --> 02:09:06,821
My wife?

1165
02:09:09,867 --> 02:09:13,202
- She knows about Marta?
- I don't know. Does she?

1166
02:09:16,498 --> 02:09:19,292
No, man. It's not her, either.

1167
02:09:26,175 --> 02:09:27,675
Marta's husband?

1168
02:09:30,721 --> 02:09:32,638
She's married? I'll be damned!

1169
02:09:33,682 --> 02:09:35,308
Shit, brother!

1170
02:09:36,268 --> 02:09:40,062
A lot of people want to kill you.

1171
02:09:41,023 --> 02:09:42,565
You know what?

1172
02:09:43,984 --> 02:09:45,485
My dog's got no name.

1173
02:09:46,695 --> 02:09:49,989
I found him in the street.
What would you call him?

1174
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:55,328
How about "Lost Dog"?

1175
02:09:56,413 --> 02:09:58,581
Some imagination!

1176
02:09:58,707 --> 02:10:00,208
You must be in advertising.

1177
02:10:01,502 --> 02:10:03,920
I was thinking, maybe Gustavo...

1178
02:10:04,671 --> 02:10:06,088
Gustavo?

1179
02:10:07,841 --> 02:10:09,467
Know any Gustavos?

1180
02:10:10,427 --> 02:10:12,053
My brother.

1181
02:10:13,138 --> 02:10:14,639
Gustavo Garfias.

1182
02:10:15,933 --> 02:10:17,600
Gustavo Miranda Garfias.

1183
02:10:21,063 --> 02:10:22,647
He's my half brother.

1184
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:27,485
Abel, Abel!

1185
02:10:28,529 --> 02:10:32,740
What did you do to deserve
a brother like that?

1186
02:10:34,117 --> 02:10:36,494
He said he's your partner.

1187
02:10:39,373 --> 02:10:41,833
Partner and half-brother.

1188
02:10:45,587 --> 02:10:49,257
- Was it him?
- I don't know. You tell me.

1189
02:10:53,554 --> 02:10:56,264
- How much?
- 5,000 pesos.

1190
02:10:57,850 --> 02:11:01,102
Only 5,000 fucking pesos!

1191
02:11:01,228 --> 02:11:03,145
And...

1192
02:11:03,272 --> 02:11:05,147
tickets to the Rolling Stones.

1193
02:11:05,274 --> 02:11:07,358
That son of a fucking bitch!

1194
02:11:09,570 --> 02:11:12,029
Why? What did I do to him?

1195
02:11:12,155 --> 02:11:13,406
Says you're screwing him.

1196
02:11:13,532 --> 02:11:16,534
No fucking way! He's my brother!

1197
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:19,745
Easy, man. That's what he says.

1198
02:11:23,667 --> 02:11:27,461
Quit yelling or I'll have
to fill you with lead.

1199
02:11:29,506 --> 02:11:32,216
So, what do we call him?

1200
02:11:36,054 --> 02:11:38,848
Who cares about your fucking dog?

1201
02:11:38,974 --> 02:11:40,725
Don't be rude!

1202
02:11:40,851 --> 02:11:44,020
Masters take after their dogs,
you know.

1203
02:11:44,146 --> 02:11:46,439
And... how do I put it?

1204
02:11:47,608 --> 02:11:50,234
If it weren't for him, you'd be dead.

1205
02:11:54,615 --> 02:11:56,616
Easy, easy.

1206
02:11:57,826 --> 02:11:59,660
I'll be in my room watching TV.

1207
02:11:59,786 --> 02:12:02,997
If you need anything at all,

1208
02:12:03,123 --> 02:12:04,999
just shout.

1209
02:12:31,944 --> 02:12:33,402
Good morning.

1210
02:12:42,329 --> 02:12:43,704
What's up, brother?

1211
02:12:44,706 --> 02:12:46,332
Got a good night's sleep?

1212
02:13:00,430 --> 02:13:01,764
What manners!

1213
02:13:03,850 --> 02:13:05,226
What will you do to me?

1214
02:13:05,936 --> 02:13:07,687
I don't know. I'm thinking.

1215
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:11,107
If you let me go...

1216
02:13:12,317 --> 02:13:14,026
I'll make you rich.

1217
02:13:17,489 --> 02:13:20,700
Kill my brother, and I'll give you
anything you want.

1218
02:13:21,994 --> 02:13:24,829
I don't need anything.
Amazing, huh?

1219
02:13:26,957 --> 02:13:29,125
I have to go. See you later.

1220
02:13:30,293 --> 02:13:32,169
I need to go to the bathroom.

1221
02:13:33,213 --> 02:13:35,923
You already have.

1222
02:13:36,049 --> 02:13:38,384
Look at you!

1223
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:40,428
You should have told me!

1224
02:13:42,597 --> 02:13:43,931
See you later.

1225
02:13:44,891 --> 02:13:46,350
Watch him for me.

1226
02:14:48,789 --> 02:14:50,915
- Hello?
- Got my money?

1227
02:14:53,085 --> 02:14:54,919
Did you notice?
He wasn't at work today.

1228
02:14:55,879 --> 02:14:56,921
Did you do it?

1229
02:14:57,047 --> 02:15:00,341
Bring the money to my place
in two hours.

1230
02:15:00,467 --> 02:15:02,009
Don't keep me waiting.

1231
02:15:17,317 --> 02:15:20,027
Did you lock it, brother?

1232
02:15:20,153 --> 02:15:21,612
Cars get stolen around here.

1233
02:15:23,406 --> 02:15:25,032
This won't be long, will it?

1234
02:15:27,285 --> 02:15:29,078
Here's what we agreed to.

1235
02:15:32,833 --> 02:15:33,999
Come in.

1236
02:15:34,709 --> 02:15:36,544
- I'd better go.
- Come in.

1237
02:15:42,509 --> 02:15:44,093
What's the matter?

1238
02:15:45,178 --> 02:15:47,930
- It's all there.
- It's cool.

1239
02:15:48,056 --> 02:15:49,473
Come with me.

1240
02:15:55,605 --> 02:15:57,022
In here.

1241
02:16:12,998 --> 02:16:14,415
Have you two met?

1242
02:16:22,048 --> 02:16:24,925
This wasn't the deal.

1243
02:16:25,051 --> 02:16:26,260
What was the deal?

1244
02:16:26,386 --> 02:16:28,804
- You were going to...
- Going to what, brother?

1245
02:16:28,930 --> 02:16:30,431
What!?

1246
02:16:33,059 --> 02:16:35,561
- That was your job!
- "Job"?

1247
02:16:35,687 --> 02:16:39,607
I misunderstood.
You wanted him off the map?

1248
02:16:39,733 --> 02:16:41,108
Do it yourself.

1249
02:16:41,234 --> 02:16:44,361
He's all yours, fucking Cain.

1250
02:16:46,364 --> 02:16:49,074
Kill him, you faggot, he's all yours!

1251
02:16:52,037 --> 02:16:53,454
I paid you...

1252
02:16:54,706 --> 02:16:56,999
I paid you to do it.
That was the deal!

1253
02:16:57,125 --> 02:16:59,251
You're not going to?

1254
02:17:00,629 --> 02:17:02,046
You want me to?

1255
02:17:03,256 --> 02:17:07,509
Do I kill him?

1256
02:17:07,636 --> 02:17:08,928
Answer me!

1257
02:17:09,054 --> 02:17:10,804
Do I kill him?

1258
02:17:13,308 --> 02:17:14,975
Or do I kill you?

1259
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:18,646
Do I kill him?

1260
02:17:18,772 --> 02:17:20,689
Do you really want me to?

1261
02:17:22,484 --> 02:17:23,817
Fucking faggot!

1262
02:17:59,854 --> 02:18:02,356
So, you coming or staying?

1263
02:20:38,555 --> 02:20:39,972
Good morning.

1264
02:20:42,559 --> 02:20:43,976
Sleep well?

1265
02:20:46,104 --> 02:20:48,480
You must have a lot to chat about.

1266
02:20:48,606 --> 02:20:51,733
Pity I can't stay,
it would be fascinating.

1267
02:20:56,823 --> 02:21:00,492
But as you might guess,
I have to leave town.

1268
02:21:01,619 --> 02:21:03,162
That's how it works.

1269
02:21:10,128 --> 02:21:11,545
Make yourselves at home.

1270
02:21:12,797 --> 02:21:15,674
I hope you'll work things out.

1271
02:21:19,888 --> 02:21:21,763
What are you looking at?

1272
02:21:28,438 --> 02:21:31,648
On the other hand,
if talking doesn't work,

1273
02:21:32,692 --> 02:21:35,486
I'll leave you this
to help settle things.

1274
02:21:35,612 --> 02:21:37,029
OK?

1275
02:21:38,239 --> 02:21:40,532
I'll call to see how things went.

1276
02:21:42,619 --> 02:21:44,369
Nice jacket.

1277
02:21:45,705 --> 02:21:48,957
There's milk and eggs in the fridge,
if you want breakfast.

1278
02:22:05,350 --> 02:22:07,184
You're dead, you bastard!

1279
02:24:44,926 --> 02:24:48,887
Hello.
This is 55445850.

1280
02:24:49,013 --> 02:24:52,641
I can't take your call right now,
but leave a message and a number,

1281
02:24:52,767 --> 02:24:55,727
and I'll get back to you.
Thank you.

1282
02:25:28,052 --> 02:25:29,511
Maru...

1283
02:25:31,013 --> 02:25:32,681
my darling...

1284
02:25:34,434 --> 02:25:36,101
This is Martin.

1285
02:25:37,729 --> 02:25:39,187
Your dad...

1286
02:25:40,690 --> 02:25:42,274
your real dad.

1287
02:25:45,111 --> 02:25:48,947
You must think
this is a sick joke.

1288
02:25:49,073 --> 02:25:53,410
For all these years,
I've been dead to you.

1289
02:25:54,954 --> 02:25:57,330
In fact...

1290
02:25:57,457 --> 02:25:59,249
I'm a living ghost.

1291
02:26:06,090 --> 02:26:08,467
When I saw you last...

1292
02:26:08,593 --> 02:26:10,802
you were only two.

1293
02:26:12,889 --> 02:26:16,933
Since then, not a day passes
that I don't think of you.

1294
02:26:19,395 --> 02:26:21,229
The afternoon I went away...

1295
02:26:25,693 --> 02:26:27,486
I held you very tight.

1296
02:26:30,490 --> 02:26:32,157
I took you in my arms...

1297
02:26:32,283 --> 02:26:34,743
I begged forgiveness
for what I was going to do.

1298
02:26:36,829 --> 02:26:38,580
At the time,

1299
02:26:38,706 --> 02:26:41,291
I thought there were
more important things

1300
02:26:41,417 --> 02:26:43,752
than being with you and your mom.

1301
02:26:43,878 --> 02:26:47,088
I wanted to set the world right,

1302
02:26:47,215 --> 02:26:48,882
and then share it with you.

1303
02:26:51,260 --> 02:26:52,844
I failed, as you can see.

1304
02:26:56,390 --> 02:26:57,849
I wound up in jail.

1305
02:26:59,852 --> 02:27:04,147
Your mother and I agreed
she would tell you... I'd died.

1306
02:27:04,273 --> 02:27:06,107
That was my idea, not hers.

1307
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:10,779
I swore to her I'd never try
to see you again...

1308
02:27:12,865 --> 02:27:14,533
but I couldn't do it.

1309
02:27:21,499 --> 02:27:25,335
I was dying, I was as dead
as I could be.

1310
02:27:27,421 --> 02:27:29,339
I'll be back to find you...

1311
02:27:30,925 --> 02:27:33,885
once I have the courage
to look you in the eyes.

1312
02:27:35,137 --> 02:27:38,223
I love you, my little girl.

1313
02:28:15,595 --> 02:28:17,345
What's your dog called?

1314
02:28:20,349 --> 02:28:22,267
Blackie.

1315
02:28:24,228 --> 02:28:25,854
Shut up, Blackie!

1316
02:28:25,980 --> 02:28:28,023
- See you around.
- Bye.

1317
02:29:27,333 --> 02:29:31,670
For Luciano, because we are also
what we have lost.
